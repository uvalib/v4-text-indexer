      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. THE VALEDICTION. Farewell, false hearts! whose best affections fail, Like shallow brooks which summer suns exhale; Forgetful of the man whom once ye chose, Cold in his cause, and careless of his woes; I bid you both a long and last adieu! Cold in my turn, and unconcern'd like you. First farewell Niger! whom, now duly proved, I disregard as much as I have loved. Your brain well furnished, and your tongue well taught To press with energy your ardent thought, Your senatorial dignity of face, Sound sense, intrepid spirit, manly grace, Have raised you high as talents can ascend, Made you a peer, but spoilt you for a friend! Pretend to all that parts have e'er acquired; Be great, be feared, be envied, be admired; To fame as lasting as the earth pretend, But not hereafter to the name of friend! I sent you verse, and, as your lordship knows, Back'd with a modest sheet of humble prose; Not to recall a promise to your mind, Fulfill'd with ease had you been so inclined, But to comply with feelings, and to give Proof of an old affection still alive. Your sullen silence serves at least to tell Your alter'd heart; and so, my lord, farewell! Next, busy actor on a meaner stage, Amusement-monger of a trifling age, Illustrious histrionic patentee, Terentius, once my friend, farewell to thee! In thee some virtuous qualities combine, To fit thee for a nobler post than thine, Who, born a gentleman, hast stoop'd too low, To live by buskin, sock, and raree-show. Thy schoolfellow, and partner of thy plays, When Nichol swung the birch and twined the bays, And having known thee bearded and full grown, The weekly censor of a laughing town, I thought the volume I presumed to send, Graced with the name of a long-absent friend, Might prove a welcome gift, and touch thine heart, Not hard by nature, in a feeling part. But thou it seems, (what cannot grandeur do, Though but a dream!) art grown disdainful too; And strutting in thy school of queens and kings, Who fret their hour and are forgotten things, Hast caught the cold distemper of the day, And, like his lordship, cast thy friend away. Oh friendship! cordial of the human breast! So little felt, so fervently professed! Thy blossoms deck our unsuspecting years; The promise of delicious fruit appears: We hug the hopes of constancy and truth, Such is the folly of our dreaming youth; But soon, alas! detect the rash mistake That sanguine inexperience loves to make; And view with tears the' expected harvest lost, Decay'd by time, or wither'd by a frost. Whoever undertakes a friend's great part Should be renew'd in nature, pure in heart, Prepared for martyrdom, and strong to prove A thousand ways the force of genuine love. He may be call'd to give up health and gain, To' exchange content for trouble, ease for pain, To echo sigh for sigh, and groan for groan, And wet his cheeks with sorrows not his own. The heart of man, for such a task too frail, When most relied on, is most sure to fail; And, summon'd to partake its fellow's woe, Starts from its office, like a broken bow. Votaries of business, and of pleasure, prove Faithless alike in friendship and in love. Retired from all the circles of the gay, And all the crowds that bustle life away, To scenes where competition, envy, strife, Beget no thunder-clouds to trouble life, Let me the charge of some good angel find, One who has known and has escaped mankind; Polite, yet virtuous, who has brought away The manners, not the morals, of the day: With him, perhaps with her, (for men have known No firmer friendships than the fair have shown,) Let me enjoy, in some unthought-of spot, All former friends forgiven, and forgot, Down to the close of life's fast fading scene, Union of hearts, without a flaw between. 'Tis grace, 'tis bounty, and it calls for praise, If God give health, that sunshine of our days; And if he add, a blessing shared by few, Content of heart, more praises still are due: But if he grant a friend, that boon possess'd Indeed is treasure, and crowns all the rest; And giving one, whose heart is in the skies, Born from above, and made divinely wise, He gives, what bankrupt Nature never can, Whose noblest coin is light and brittle man, Gold, purer far than Ophir ever knew, A soul, an image of himself, and therefore true. THE DISTRESSED TRAVELLERS; OR, LABOUR IN VAIN. An excellent New Song, to a Tune never sung before. 1 I sing of a journey to Clifton, We would have perform'd if we could, Without cart or barrow to lift on Poor Mary and me through the mud. Slee sla slud, Stuck in the mud, O it is pretty to wade through a flood! 2 So away we went, slipping and sliding, Hop, hop, a la mode de deux frogs. 'Tis near as good walking as riding, When ladies are dress'd in their clogs. Wheels, no doubt, Go briskly about, But they clatter and rattle, and make such a rout! She.Well! now I protest it is charming; How finely the weather improves!— That cloud, though, is rather alarming; How slowly and stately it moves! He. Pshaw! never mind; 'Tis not in the wind; We are travelling south, and shall leave it behind. She.I am glad we are come for an airing, For folks may be pounded and penn'd, Until they grow rusty, not caring To stir half a mile to an end. He. The longer we stay, The longer we may; It's a folly to think about weather or way. She.But now I begin to be frighted: If I fall, what a way I should roll! I am glad that the bridge was indicted.— Stop! stop! I am sunk in a hole! He. Nay, never care! 'Tis a common affair; You'll not be the last that will set a foot there. She.Let me breathe now a little, and ponder On what it were better to do, That terrible lane, I see yonder, I think we shall never get through! He. So think I; But, by the bye, We never shall know, if we never should try. She. But should we get there, how shall we get home? What a terrible deal of bad road we have past! Slipping and sliding; and if we should come To a difficult stile, I am ruined at last. Oh this lane! Now it is plain That struggling and striving is labour in vain. He. Stick fast there, while I go and look. She. Don't go away, for fear I should fall! He. I have examined it every nook, And what you have here is a sample of all. Come, wheel round; the dirt we have found, Would be an estate at a farthing a pound. 9 Now, Sister Anne, the guitar you must take; Set it, and sing it, and make it a song. I have varied the verse for variety sake, And cut it off short, because it was long. 'Tis hobbling and lame, Which critics won't blame, For the sense and the sound, they say, should be the same. BENEFACTIONS. A POEM IN SHENSTONE'S MANNER. ADDRESSED TO MY DEAR COZ, APRIL 14, 1788. This cap that so stately appears With ribbon-bound tassel on high, Which seems by the crest that it rears Ambitious of brushing the sky; This cap to my Harriet I owe; She gave it, and gave me beside A ribbon, worn out long ago, With which in its youth it was tied. This chair that I press at my ease, With tresses of steeds that were black Well cover'd, and wadded to please The sitter, both bottom and back; Thick-studded with bordering nails, Smooth-headed and gilded and bright, As Vesper, who when the day fails, Adorns the dark forehead of Night: These carpets, so soft to the foot, Caledonia's traffic and pride, (Oh spare them, ye Knights of the Boot, Dirt-splash'd in a cross-country ride!) This table and mirror within, Secure from collision and dust, At which I oft shave cheek and chin, And periwig nicely adjust: This moveable structure of shelves, Contrived both for splendour and use, And charged with octavoes and twelves, The gayest I had to produce; Where flaming in scarlet and gold My poems enchanted I view, And hope in due time to behold My Iliad and Odyssey too: This china that decks the alcove, Which mortals have named a beaufette, But what the Gods call it above Has ne'er been revealed to us yet: These curtains that keep the room warm Or cool, as the season demands; Those stoves which for figure and form Seem the labour of Mulciber's hands: That range, from which many a mess Comes smoking the stomach to cheer; That tub,—(you might bathe in a less,) Where malt is transform'd into beer: These painted and unpainted chairs, Those cushion'd, these curiously framed; Yon bedding and bed above stairs, With other things not to be named: These items endear my abode, Disposing me oft to reflect By whom they were kindly bestowed, Whom here I impatient expect. But, hush! She a parent attends, Whose dial-hand points to eleven, Who, oldest and dearest of friends, Waits only a passage to Heaven. Then willingly want her awhile, And, sweeping the chords of your lyre, The gloom of her absence beguile As now, with poetical fire. 'Tis yours, for true glory athirst, In high-flying ditty to rise On feathers renown'd from the first For bearing a goose to the skies. SWEET MEAT HAS SOUR SAUCE: OR, THE SLAVE-TRADER IN THE DUMPS. A trader I am to the African shore, But since that my trading is like to be o'er, I'll sing you a song that you ne'er heard before, Which nobody can deny, deny, Which nobody can deny. When I first heard the news it gave me a shock, Much like what they call an electrical knock, And now I am going to sell off my stock, Which nobody, &amp;c. 'Tis a curious assortment of dainty regales, To tickle the Negroes with when the ship sails, Fine chains for the neck, and a cat with nine tails, Which nobody, &amp;c. Here's supple-jack plenty, and store of rat-tan, That will wind itself round the sides of a man, As close as a hoop round a bucket or can, Which nobody, &amp;c. Here's padlocks and bolts, and screws for the thumbs, That squeeze them so lovingly till the blood comes, They sweeten the temper like comfits or plums, Which nobody, &amp;c. When a Negro his head from his victuals withdraws. And clenches his teeth and thrusts out his paws, Here's a notable engine to open his jaws, Which nobody, &amp;c. Thus going to market, we kindly prepare A pretty black cargo of African ware, For what they must meet with when they get there, Which nobody, &amp;c. 'Twould do your heart good to see 'em below, Lie flat on their backs all the way as we go, Like sprats on a gridiron, scores in a row, Which nobody, &amp;c. But ah! if in vain I have studied an art So gainful to me, all boasting apart, I think it will break my compassionate heart, Which nobody, &amp;c. For oh! how it enters my soul like an awl! This pity, which some people self-pity call, Is sure the most heart-piercing pity of all, Which nobody, &amp;c. So this is my song, as I told you before; Come, buy off my stock, for I must no more Carry Cæsars and Pompeys to Sugar-cane shore, Which nobody can deny, deny, Which nobody can deny. END OF VOL. II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. III. TO MARY. The twentieth year is well nigh past, Since first our sky was overcast; Ah would that this might be the last! My Mary! Thy spirits have a fainter flow, I see thee daily weaker grow; 'Twas my distress that brought thee low, My Mary! Thy needles, once a shining store, For my sake restless heretofore, Now rust disused, and shine no more; My Mary! For though thou gladly wouldst fulfil The same kind office for me still, Thy sight now seconds not thy will, My Mary! But well thou play'dst the housewife's part; And all thy threads with magic art, Have wound themselves about this heart, My Mary! Thy indistinct expressions seem Like language utter'd in a dream; Yet me they charm, whate'er the theme, My Mary! Thy silver locks, once auburn bright, Are still more lovely in my sight Than golden beams of orient light, My Mary! For could I view nor them nor thee, What sight worth seeing could I see? The sun would rise in vain for me, My Mary! Partakers of thy sad decline, Thy hands their little force resign; Yet gently prest, press gently mine, My Mary! Such feebleness of limbs thou prov'st, That now at every step thou mov'st Upheld by two;—yet still thou lov'st, My Mary! And still to love, though prest with ill, In wintry age to feel no chill, With me is to be lovely still, My Mary! But ah! by constant heed I know, How oft the sadness that I show, Transforms thy smiles to looks of woe, My Mary! And should my future lot be cast With much resemblance of the past, Thy worn-out heart will break at last, My Mary! THE CAST-AWAY. Obscurest night involved the sky; The' Atlantic billows roar'd, When such a destin'd wretch as I, Wash'd headlong from on board, Of friends, of hope, of all bereft, His floating home for ever left. No braver chief could Albion boast, Than he, with whom he went, Nor ever ship left Albion's coast, With warmer wishes sent. He loved them both, but both in vain, Nor him beheld, nor her again. Not long beneath the whelming brine, Expert to swim, he lay; Nor soon he felt his strength decline, Or courage die away; But waged with death a lasting strife, Supported by despair of life. He shouted: nor his friends had fail'd To check the vessel's course, But so the furious blast prevail'd, That, pitiless perforce, They left their outcast mate behind, And scudded still before the wind. Some succour yet they could afford; And, such as storms allow, The cask, the coop, the floated cord, Delay'd not to bestow; But he (they knew) nor ship nor shore, Whate'er they gave, should visit more. Nor, cruel as it seem'd, could he Their haste himself condemn, Aware that flight, in such a sea, Alone could rescue them; Yet bitter felt it still to die Deserted, and his friends so nigh. He long survives, who lives an hour In ocean, self-upheld: And so long he, with unspent power, His destiny repell'd; And ever, as the minutes flew, Entreated help, or cried—“Adieu!” At length, his transient respite past, His comrades, who before Had heard his voice in every blast, Could catch the sound no more. For then, by toil subdued, he drank The stifling wave, and then he sank. No poet wept him: but the page Of narrative sincere, That tells his name, his worth, his age, Is wet with Anson's tear. And tears by bards or heroes shed, Alike immortalize the dead. I therefore purpose not, or dream, Descanting on his fate, To give the melancholy theme A more enduring date: But misery still delights to trace Its semblance in another's case. No voice divine the storm allay'd, No light propitious shone; When, snatch'd from all effectual aid, We perish'd, each alone: But I beneath a rougher sea, And whelm'd in deeper gulfs than he. IN MEMORY OF WILLIAM COWPER, ESQ. BORN IN HERTFORDSHIRE, 1731. BURIED IN THIS CHURCH, 1800. Ye, who with warmth the public triumph feel Of talents dignified by sacred zeal, Here, to devotion's bard devoutly just, Pay your fond tribute due to Cowper's dust! England, exulting in his spotless fame, Ranks with her dearest sons his favourite name. Sense, fancy, wit, suffice not all to raise So clear a title to affection's praise: His highest honours to the heart belong; His virtues form'd the magic of his song. END OF VOL. III.</field>

Poor Vestris, grieved beyond all measure, To have incurred so much displeasure; Although a Frenchman, disconcerted, And though light heeled, yet heavy hearted, Begs humbly to inform his friends, Next first of April, he intends To take a boat and row right down To Cuckolds' point, from Richmond town; And as he goes, alert and gay, Leap all the bridges in his way The boat borne downward with the tide, Shall catch him safe on t'other side; He humbly hopes by this expedient, To prove himself their most obedient, (Which shall be always his endeavour,) And jump into their former favour. TO LADY AUSTEN. To watch the storms, and hear the sky Give all our almanacks the lie; To shake with cold, and see the plains In autumn drown'd with wintry rains; 'Tis thus I spend my moments here, And wish myself a Dutch Mynheer; I then should have no need of wit, For lumpish Hollander unfit. Nor should I then repine at mud, Or meadows deluged with a flood; But in a bog live well content, And find it just my element; Should be a clod, and not a man, Nor wish in vain for Sister Ann, With charitable aid to drag My mind out of its proper quag; Should have the genius of a boor, And no ambition to have more.

O man, immortal by a double prize, By fame on earth, by glory in the skies! TO WM. COWPER, OF THE INNER TEMPLE, ESQ. ON HIS POEMS IN THE SECOND VOLUME. In what high strains, my Muse, wilt thou Attempt great Cowper's worth to show?

TO WARREN HASTINGS, ESQ. BY AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW OF HIS AT WESTMINSTER. Hastings! I knew thee young, and of a mind, While young, humane, conversable, and kind; Nor can I well believe thee, gentle then, Now grown a villain, and the worst of men; But rather some suspect, who have oppress'd And worried thee, as not themselves the best. EPITAPH ON FOP, A DOG BELONGING TO LADY THROCKMORTON. Though once a puppy, and though Fop by name, Here moulders one whose bones some honour claim. No sycophant, although of spaniel race, And though no hound, a martyr to the chase— Ye squirrels, rabbits, leverets, rejoice, Your haunts no longer echo to his voice; This record of his fate exulting view, He died worn out with vain pursuit of you. “Yes (the indignant shade of Fop replies)— And worn with vain pursuit Man also dies.” TO A YOUNG FRIEND, ON HIS ARRIVING AT CAMBRIDGE WET, WHEN NO RAIN HAD FALLEN THERE.

Not that my Muse, though bashful, shall deny She would have thank'd thee rather, hadst thou cast A treasure in her way; for neither meed Of early breakfast, to dispel the fumes And bowel-raking pains of emptiness, Nor noontide feast, nor evening's cool repast, Hopes she from this, presumptuous—though perhaps The cobbler, leather-carving artist, might. Nathless she thanks thee, and accepts thy boon, Whatever; not as erst the fabled cock, Vain-glorious fool, unknowing what he found, Spurn'd the rich gem thou gavest him. Wherefore, ah! Why not on me that favour, (worthier sure,) Conferr'dst thou, Goddess? Thou art blind, thou say'st: Enough!—thy blindness shall excuse the deed. Nor does my Muse no benefit exhale From this thy scant indulgence;—even here, Hints, worthy sage philosophy, are found, Illustrious hints, to moralize my song. This ponderous Heel of perforated hide Compact, with pegs indented many a row, Haply, (for such its massy form bespeaks,) The weighty tread of some rude peasant clown Upbore: on this supported oft he stretch'd, With uncouth strides, along the furrow'd glebe, Flattening the stubborn clod, till cruel time (What will not cruel time?) on a wry step, Sever'd the strict cohesion; when, alas! He, who could erst with even equal pace, Pursue his destin'd way with symmetry And some proportion form'd, now, on one side, Curtail'd and maim'd, the sport of vagrant boys, Cursing his frail supporter, treacherous prop! With toilsome steps, and difficult, moves on. Thus fares it oft with other than the feet Of humble villager:—the statesman thus, Up the steep road where proud ambition leads, Aspiring, first uninterrupted winds His prosperous way; nor fears miscarriage foul, While policy prevails and friends prove true: But that support soon failing, by him left On whom he most depended,—basely left, Betrayed, deserted,—from his airy height Headlong he falls, and through the rest of life Drags the dull load of disappointment on. AN ODE, ON READING MR. RICHARDSON'S HISTORY OF SIR CHARLES GRANDISON. Say, ye apostate and profane, Wretches who blush not to disdain Allegiance to your God,— Did e'er your idly-wasted love Of virtue for her sake remove And lift you from the crowd? Would you the race of glory run, Know, the devout and they alone, Are equal to the task: The labours of the illustrious course Far other than the unaided force Of human vigour ask, To arm against repeated ill The patient heart too brave to feel The tortures of despair; Nor safer yet high-crested Pride, When wealth flows in with every tide To gain admittance there. To rescue from the tyrant's sword Th'oppress'd;—unseen and unimplored, To cheer the face of woe; From lawless insult to defend An orphan's right, a fallen friend, And a forgiven foe; These, these distinguish from the crowd, And these alone, the great and good, The guardians of mankind; Whose bosoms with these virtues heave, Oh, with what matchless speed, they leave The multitude behind! Then ask ye, from what cause on earth Virtues like these derive their birth? Deriv'd from Heaven alone, Full on that favour'd breast they shine, Where faith and resignation join To call the blessing down. Such is that heart;—but while the Muse Thy theme, O Richardson, pursues, Her feebler spirits faint: She cannot reach, and would not wrong, That subject for an angel's song, The hero, and the saint! IN A LETTER TO C. P. ESQ. ILL WITH THE RHEUMATISM. Grant me the Muse, ye gods! whose humble flight Seeks not the mountain-top's pernicious height; Who can the tall Parnassian cliff forsake, To visit oft the still Lethean lake; Now her slow pinions brush the silent shore, Now gently skim the unwrinkled waters o'er, There dips her downy plumes, thence upward flies, And sheds soft slumbers on her votary's eyes. IN A LETTER TO THE SAME. IN IMITATION OF SHAKESPEARE. Trust me the meed of praise, dealt thriftily From the nice scale of judgement, honours more Than does the lavish and o'erbearing tide Of profuse courtesy. Not all the gems Of India's richest soil at random spread O'er the gay vesture of some glittering dame, Give such alluring vantage to the person, As the scant lustre of a few, with choice And comely guise of ornament disposed. PSALM CXXXVII. To Babylon's proud waters brought, In bondage where we lay, With tears on Sion's Hill we thought, And sigh'd our hours away; Neglected on the willows hung Our useless harps, while every tongue Bewail'd the fatal day. Then did the base insulting foe Some joyous notes demand, Such as in Sion used to flow From Judah's happy band: Alas! what joyous notes have we, Our country spoil'd, no longer free, And in a foreign land! O Solyma! if e'er thy praise Be silent in my song, Rude and unpleasing be the lays, And artless be my tongue! Thy name my fancy still employs; To thee, great fountain of my joys, My sweetest airs belong. Remember, Lord! that hostile sound, When Edom's children cried, “Razed be her turrets to the ground, And humbled be her pride!” Remember, Lord! and let the foe The terrors of thy vengeance know, The vengeance they defied! Thou too, great Babylon, shalt fall A victim to our God; Thy monstrous crimes already call For Heaven's chastising rod. Happy who shall thy little ones Relentless dash against the stones, And spread their limbs abroad. SONG. [No more shall hapless Celia's ears] No more shall hapless Celia's ears Be flatter'd with the cries Of lovers drown'd in floods of tears, Or murder'd by her eyes; No serenades to break her rest, Nor songs her slumbers to molest, With my fa, la, la. The fragrant flowers that once would bloom And flourish in her hair, Since she no longer breathes perfume Their odours to repair, Must fade, alas! and wither now, As placed on any common brow, With my fa, la, la. Her lip, so winning and so meek, No longer has its charms; As well she might by whistling seek To lure us to her arms; Affected once, 'tis real now, As her forsaken gums may show, With my fa, la, la. The down that on her chin so smooth So lovely once appear'd, That, too, has left her with her youth, Or sprouts into a beard; As fields, so green when newly sown, With stubble stiff are overgrown, With my fa, la, la. Then, Celia, leave your apish tricks, And change your girlish airs, For ombre, snuff, and politics, Those joys that suit your years; No patches can lost youth recall, Nor whitewash prop a tumbling wall, With my fa, la, la. AN ATTEMPT AT THE MANNER OF WALLER. Drayton, March, 1753. Did not thy reason and thy sense, With most persuasive eloquence, Convince me that obedience due None may so justly claim as you, By right of beauty you would be Mistress o'er my heart and me. Then fear not I should e'er rebel, My gentle love! I might as well A forward peevishness put on, And quarrel with the mid-day sun; Or question who gave him a right To be so fiery and so bright. Nay, this were less absurd and vain Than disobedience to thy reign; His beams are often too severe; But thou art mild, as thou art fair; First from necessity we own your sway, Then scorn our freedom, and by choice obey. A SONG. [The sparkling eye, the mantling cheek] The sparkling eye, the mantling cheek, The polish'd front, the snowy neck, How seldom we behold in one! Glossy locks, and brow serene, Venus' smiles, Diana's mien, All meet in you, and you alone. Beauty, like other powers, maintains Her empire, and by union reigns; Each single feature faintly warms: But where at once we view display'd Unblemish'd grace, the perfect maid Our eyes, our ears, our heart alarms. So when on earth the god of day Obliquely sheds his temper'd ray, Through convex orbs the beams transmit, The beams that gently warm'd before, Collected, gently warm no more, But glow with more prevailing heat. A SONG. [On the green margin of the brook] On the green margin of the brook Despairing Phyllida reclined, Whilst every sigh, and every look, Declared the anguish of her mind. Am I less lovely then? (she cries, And in the waves her form survey'd;) Oh yes, I see my languid eyes, My faded cheek, my colour fled: These eyes no more like lightning pierced, These cheeks grew pale, when Damon first His Phillida betray'd. The rose he in his bosom wore, How oft upon my breast was seen! And when I kiss'd the drooping flower, Behold, he cried, it blooms again! The wreaths that bound my braided hair, Himself next day was proud to wear At church, or on the green. While thus sad Phyllida lamented, Chance brought unlucky Thyrsis on; Unwillingly the nymph consented, But Damon first the cheat begun. She wiped the fallen tears away, Then sigh'd and blush'd, as who should say Ah! Thyrsis, I am won. UPON A VENERABLE RIVAL. Full thirty frosts since thou wert young Have chill'd the withered grove, Thou wretch! and hast thou lived so long, Nor yet forgot to love? Ye Sages! spite of your pretences To wisdom, you must own Your folly frequently commences When you acknowledge none. Not that I deem it weak to love, Or folly to admire; But ah! the pangs we lovers prove Far other years require. Unheeded on the youthful brow The beams of Phœbus play; But unsupported Age stoops low Beneath the sultry ray. For once, then, if untutor'd youth, Youth unapproved by years, May chance to deviate into truth, When your experience errs; For once attempt not to despise What I esteem a rule: Who early loves, though young, is wise,— Who old, though grey, a fool. ON THE PICTURE OF A SLEEPING CHILD. FROM THE LATIN OF VINCENT BOURNE. Sweet babe, whose image here express'd Does thy peaceful slumbers show; Guilt or fear, to break thy rest, Never did thy spirit know. Soothing slumbers, soft repose, Such as mock the painter's skill, Such as innocence bestows, Harmless infant, lull thee still! [Mortals! around your destined heads] Mortals! around your destined heads Thick fly the shafts of Death, And lo! the savage spoiler spreads A thousand toils beneath. In vain we trifle with our fate, Try every art in vain; At best we but prolong the date, And lengthen out our pain. Fondly we think all danger fled, For Death is ever nigh; Outstrips our unavailing speed, Or meets us as we fly. Thus the wreck'd mariner may strive Some desert shore to gain, Secure of life, if he survive The fury of the main. But there, to famine doom'd a prey, Finds the mistaken wretch He but escaped the troubled sea, To perish on the beach. Since then in vain we strive to guard Our frailty from the foe, Lord, let me live not unprepared To meet the fatal blow! AN EPISTLE TO ROBERT LLOYD, ESQ. 1754. 'Tis not that. I design to rob Thee of thy birthright, gentle Bob,— For thou art born sole heir and single Of dear Mat Prior's easy jingle; Nor that I mean, while thus I knit My threadbare sentiments together, To show my genius or my wit, When God and you know, I have neither; Or such, as might be better shown By letting poetry alone. 'Tis not with either of these views, That I presume to address the Muse: But to divert a fierce banditti, (Sworn foes to every thing that's witty,) That, with a black infernal train, Make cruel inroads in my brain, And daily threaten to drive thence My little garrison of sense: The fierce banditti which I mean, Are gloomy thoughts led on by Spleen. Then there's another reason yet, Which is, that I may fairly quit The debt which justly became due The moment when I heard from you: And you might grumble, crony mine, If paid in any other coin; Since twenty sheets of lead, God knows, (I would say twenty sheets of prose,) Can ne'er be deem'd worth half so much As one of gold, and yours was such. Thus the preliminaries settled, I fairly find myself pitch-kettled; And cannot see, though few see better, How I shall hammer out a letter. First, for a thought—since all agree— A thought—I have it—let me see— 'Tis gone again—plague on't! I thought I had it—but I have it not. Dame Gurton thus and Hodge her son, That useful thing, her needle, gone, Rake well the cinders, sweep the floor, And sift the dust behind the door; While eager Hodge beholds the prize In old grimalkin's glaring eyes; And Gammar finds it on her knees In every shining straw she sees. This simile were apt enough, But I've another, critic-proof. The virtuoso thus at noon, Broiling beneath a July sun, The gilded butterfly pursues O'er hedge and ditch, through gaps and mews, And after many a vain essay To captivate the tempting prey, Gives him at length the lucky pat, And has him safe beneath his hat: Then lifts it gently from the ground; But ah! 'tis lost as soon as found; Culprit his liberty regains; Flits out of sight and mocks his pains. The sense was dark, 'twas therefore fit With simile to illustrate it; But as too much obscures the sight, As often as too little light, We have our similes cut short, For matters of more grave import. That Matthew's numbers run with ease Each man of common sense agrees; All men of common sense allow, That Robert's lines are easy too; Where then the preference shall we place, Or how do justice in this case? Matthew (says Fame) with endless pains Smooth'd and refined the meanest strains, Nor suffer'd one ill-chosen rhyme To escape him at the idlest time; And thus o'er all a lustre cast, That while the language lives shall last. An't please your ladyship, (quoth I,— For 'tis my business to reply;) Sure so much labour, so much toil, Bespeak at least a stubborn soil. Theirs be the laurel-wreath decreed, Who both write well and write full speed; Who throw their Helicon about As freely as a conduit spout. Friend Robert, thus like chien sçavant, Lets fall a poem en passant, Nor needs his genuine ore refine; 'Tis ready polish'd from the mine. OF HIMSELF. William was once a bashful youth; His modesty was such, That one might say (to say the truth) He rather had too much. Some said that it was want of sense, And others want of spirit, (So blest a thing is impudence,) While others could not bear it. But some a different notion had, And at each other winking, Observed, that though he little said, He paid it off with thinking. Howe'er, it happen'd, by degrees, He mended and grew perter; In company was more at ease, And dress'd a little smarter; Nay, now and then would look quite gay, As other people do; And sometimes said, or tried to say A witty thing or so. He eyed the women, and made free To comment on their shapes; So that there was, or seem'd to be, No fear of a relapse. The women said, who thought him rough, But now no longer foolish, “The creature may do well enough, But wants a deal of polish.” At length, improved from head to heel, 'Twere scarce too much to say, No dancing bear was so genteel, Or half so dégagé. Now that a miracle so strange May not in vain be shown, Let the dear maid who wrought the change E'er claim him for her own. AN APOLOGY FOR NOT SHOWING HER WHAT I HAD WROTE. Cutfield, July, 1752. Did not my Muse (what can she less?) Perceive her own unworthiness, Could she by some well chosen theme, But hope to merit your esteem, She would not thus conceal her lays, Ambitious to deserve your praise. But should my Delia take offence, And frown on her impertinence, In silence, sorrowing and forlorn, Would the despairing trifler mourn, Curse her ill-tuned, unpleasing lute, Then sigh and sit for ever mute. In secret therefore let her play, Squandering her idle notes away In secret as she chants along, Cheerful and careless in her song; Nor heeds she whether harsh or clear, Free from each terror, every fear, From that, of all most dreaded, free, The terror of offending Thee. [Delia, the unkindest girl on earth] At the same place. Delia, the unkindest girl on earth, When I besought the fair, That favour of intrinsic worth, A ringlet of her hair,— Refused that instant to comply With my absurd request, For reasons she could specify, Some twenty score at least. Trust me, my dear, however odd It may appear to say, I sought it merely to defraud Thy spoiler of his prey. Yet when its sister locks shall fade, As quickly fade they must, When all their beauties are decay'd, Their gloss, their colour, lost,— Ah then! if haply to my share Some slender pittance fall, If I but gain one single hair, Nor age usurp them all;— When you behold it still as sleek, As lovely to the view, As when it left thy snowy neck,— That Eden where it grew,— Then shall my Delia's self declare That I profess'd the truth, And have preserved my little share In everlasting youth. [This evening, Delia, you and I] At the same place. This evening, Delia, you and I Have managed most delightfully, For with a frown we parted; Having contrived some trifle that We both may be much troubled at, And sadly disconcerted. Yet well as each perform'd their part, We might perceive it was but art; And that we both intended To sacrifice a little ease; For all such petty flaws as these Are made but to be mended. You knew, dissembler! all the while, How sweet it was to reconcile After this heavy pelt; That we should gain by this allay When next we met, and laugh away The care we never felt. Happy! when we but seek to endure A little pain, then find a cure By double joy requited; For friendship, like a severed bone, Improves and joins a stronger tone When aptly reunited. WRITTEN IN A QUARREL. (THE DELIVERY OF IT PREVENTED BY A RECONCILIATION.) Think, Delia, with what cruel haste Our fleeting pleasures move, Nor heedless thus in sorrow waste The moments due to love; Be wise, my fair, and gently treat These few that are our friends; Think thus abused, what sad regret Their speedy flight attends! Sure in those eyes I loved so well, And wish'd so long to see, Anger I thought could never dwell, Or anger aim'd at me. No bold offence of mine I knew Should e'er provoke your hate; And, early taught to think you true, Still hoped a gentler fate. With kindness bless the present hour, Or oh! we meet in vain! What can we do in absence more Than suffer and complain? Fated to ills beyond redress, We must endure our woe; The days allow'd us to possess, 'Tis madness to forego. THE SYMPTOMS OF LOVE. Would my Delia know if I love, let her take My last thought at night, and the first when I wake; With my prayers and best wishes preferr'd for her sake. Let her guess what I muse on, when rambling alone I stride o'er the stubble each day with my gun, Never ready to shoot till the covey is flown. Let her think what odd whimsies I have in my brain, When I read one page over and over again, And discover at last that I read it in vain. Let her say why so fix'd and so steady my look, Without ever regarding the person who spoke, Still affecting to laugh, without hearing the joke. Or why when with pleasure her praises I hear, (That sweetest of melody sure to my ear,) I attend, and at once inattentive appear. And lastly, when summon'd to drink to my flame, Let her guess why I never once mention her name, Though herself and the woman I love are the same. [See where the Thames, the purest stream] See where the Thames, the purest stream That wavers to the noon-day beam, Divides the vale below; While like a vein of liquid ore His waves enrich the happy shore, Still shining as they flow. Nor yet, my Delia, to the main Runs the sweet tide without a stain, Unsullied as it seems; The nymphs of many a sable flood Deform with streaks of oozy mud The bosom of the Thames. Some idle rivulets, that feed And suckle ev'ry noisome weed, A sandy bottom boast; For ever bright, for ever clear, The trifling shallow rills appear In their own channel lost. Thus fares it with the human soul, Where copious floods of passion roll, By genuine love supplied; Fair in itself the current shows, But ah! a thousand anxious woes Pollute the noble tide. These are emotions known to few; For where at most a vapoury dew Surrounds the tranquil heart, Then as the triflers never prove The glad excess of real love, They never prove the smart. O then my life, at last relent! Though cruel the reproach I sent, My sorrow was unfeign'd: Your passion, had I loved you not, You might have scorn'd, renounced, forgot, And I had ne'er complain'd. While you indulge a groundless fear, The imaginary woes you bear Are real woes to me: But thou art kind, and good thou art, Nor wilt, by wronging thine own heart, Unjustly punish me. [How bless'd the youth whom Fate ordains] How bless'd the youth whom Fate ordains A kind relief from all his pains, In some admired fair; Whose tenderest wishes find express'd Their own resemblance in her breast, Exactly copied there! What good soe'er the gods dispense, The enjoyment of its influence Still on her love depends; Her love the shield that guards his heart, Or wards the blow, or blunts the dart That peevish Fortune sends. Thus, Delia, while thy love endures, The flame my happy breast secures From Fortune's fickle power; Change as she list, she may increase, But not abate my happiness, Confirm'd by thee before. Thus while I share her smiles with thee, Welcome, my love, shall ever be The favours she bestows; Yet not on those I found my bliss, But in the noble ecstasies The faithful bosom knows. And when she prunes her wings for flight, And flutters nimbly from my sight, Contented I resign Whate'er she gave; thy love alone I can securely call my own, Happy while that is mine. [Bid adieu, my sad heart, bid adieu to thy peace!] Berkhamstead. Bid adieu, my sad heart, bid adieu to thy peace! Thy pleasure is past, and thy sorrows increase; See the shadows of evening how far they extend, And a long night is coming, that never may end; For the sun is now set that enliven'd the scene, And an age must be past e'er it rises again. Already deprived of its splendour and heat, I feel thee more slowly, more heavily beat; Perhaps overstrain'd with the quick pulse of pleasure, Thou art glad of this respite to beat at thy leisure; But the sigh of distress shall now weary thee more Than the flutter and tumult of passion before. The heart of a lover is never at rest, With joy overwhelm'd, or with sorrow oppress'd: When Delia is near, all is ecstasy then, And I even forget I must lose her again: When absent, as wretched as happy before, Despairing I cry, I shall see her no more! WRITTEN AFTER LEAVING HER AT NEW BURNS. At Berkhamstead. How quick the change from joy to woe! How chequer'd is our lot below! Seldom we view the prospect fair, Dark clouds of sorrow, pain, and care, (Some pleasing intervals between,) Scowl over more than half the scene. Last week with Delia, gentle maid, Far hence in happier fields I stray'd, While on her dear enchanting tongue Soft sounds of grateful welcome hung, For absence had withheld it long. “Welcome, my long-lost love, she said, E'er since our adverse fates decreed That we must part, and I must mourn 'Till once more bless'd by thy return, Love, on whose influence I relied For all the transports I enjoy'd, Has play'd the cruel tyrant's part And turn'd tormentor to my heart. But let me hold thee to my breast, Dear partner of my joy and rest, And not a pain, and not a fear, Or anxious doubt, shall enter there.” Happy, thought I, the favour'd youth, Bless'd with such undissembled truth!— Five suns successive rose and set, And saw no monarch in his state, Wrapp'd in the blaze of majesty, So free from every care as I.— Next day the scene was overcast; Such day till then I never pass'd,— For on that day, relentless fate! Delia and I must separate. Yet e'er we look'd our last farewell, From her dear lips this comfort fell:— “Fear not that time, where'er we rove, Or absence, shall abate my love.” And can I doubt, my charming maid, As unsincere what you have said? Banish'd from thee to what I hate, Dull neighbours and insipid chat, No joy to cheer me, none in view, But the dear hope of meeting you; And that through passion's optic seen, With ages interposed between;— Bless'd with the kind support you give, 'Tis by your promised truth I live; How deep my woes, how fierce my flame, You best may tell, who feel the same. ON HER ENDEAVOURING TO CONCEAL HER GRIEF AT PARTING. Ah! wherefore should my weeping maid suppress Those gentle signs of undissembled woe? When from soft love proceeds the deep distress, Ah! why forbid the willing tears to flow? Since for my sake each dear translucent drop Breaks forth, best witness of thy truth sincere, My lips should drink the precious mixture up, And, ere it falls, receive the trembling tear. Trust me, these symptoms of thy faithful heart, In absence shall my dearest hope sustain, Delia! since such thy sorrow that we part, Such when we meet thy joy shall be again. Hard is that heart and unsubdued by love That feels no pain, nor ever heaves a sigh; Such hearts the fiercest passions only prove, Or freeze in cold insensibility. Oh! then indulge thy grief, nor fear to tell The gentle source from whence thy sorrows flow; Nor think it weakness when we love to feel, Nor think it weakness what we feel to show. [Hope, like the short-lived ray that gleams awhile] Hope, like the short-lived ray that gleams awhile Through wintry skies, upon the frozen waste, Cheers e'en the face of misery to a smile; But soon the momentary pleasure's past. How oft, my Delia, since our last farewell, (Years that have roll'd since that distressful hour,) Grieved I have said, when most our hopes prevail, Our promised happiness is least secure. Oft I have thought the scene of troubles closed, And hoped once more to gaze upon your charms; As oft some dire mischance has interposed, And snatch'd the' expected blessing from my arms. The seaman thus, his shatter'd vessel lost, Still vainly strives to shun the threatening death; And while he thinks to gain the friendly coast, And drops his feet, and feels the sands beneath, Borne by the wave steep-sloping from the shore, Back to the inclement deep, again he beats The surge aside, and seems to tread secure; And now the refluent wave his baffled toil defeats. Had you, my love, forbade me to pursue My fond attempt, disdainfully retired, And with proud scorn compell'd me to subdue The ill-fated passion by yourself inspired; Then haply to some distant spot removed, Hopeless to gain, unwilling to molest With fond entreaties whom I dearly loved, Despair or absence had redeem'd my rest. But now, sole partner in my Delia's heart, Yet doom'd far off in exile to complain, Eternal absence cannot ease my smart, And hope subsists but to prolong my pain. Oh then, kind Heaven, be this my latest breath! Here end my life, or make it worth my care; Absence from whom we love is worse than death, And frustrate hope severer than despair. R. S. S. All-worshipp'd Gold! thou mighty mystery! Say by what name shall I address thee rather, Our blessing, or our bane? Without thy aid, The generous pangs of pity but distress The human heart, that fain would feel the bliss Of blessing others; and, enslaved by thee, Far from relieving woes which others feel, Misers oppress themselves. Our blessing then With virtue when possess'd; without, our bane. If in my bosom unperceived there lurk The deep-sown seeds of avarice or ambition, Blame me, ye great ones, (for I scorn your censure,) But let the generous and the good commend me; That to my Delia I direct them all, The worthiest object of a virtuous love. Oh! to some distant scene, a willing exile From the wild uproar of this busy world, Were it my fate with Delia to retire; With her to wander through the sylvan shade, Each morn, or o'er the moss-imbrowned turf, Where, bless'd as the prime parents of mankind In their own Eden, we would envy none; But, greatly pitying whom the world calls happy, Gently spin out the silken thread of life; While from her lips attentive I receive The tenderest dictates of the purest flame, And from her eyes (where soft complacence sits Illumined with the radiant beams of sense,) Tranquillity beyond a monarch's reach. Forgive me, Heaven, this only avarice My soul indulges; I confess the crime, (If to esteem, to covet such perfection Be criminal,) Oh grant me Delia! grant me wealth! Wealth to alleviate, not increase my wants; And grant me virtue, without which nor wealth Nor Delia can avail to make me bless'd. WRITTEN IN A FIT OF ILLNESS. R. S. S. In these sad hours, a prey to ceaseless pain, While feverish pulses leap in every vein, When each faint breath the last short effort seems Of life just parting from my feeble limbs; How wild soe'er my wandering thoughts may be, Still, gentle Delia, still they turn on thee! At length if, slumbering to a short repose, A sweet oblivion frees me from my woes, Thy form appears, thy footsteps I pursue, Through springy vales, and meadows wash'd in dew; Thy arm supports me to the fountain's brink, Where by some secret power forbid to drink, Gasping with thirst, I view the tempting flood That flies my touch, or thickens into mud; Till thine own hand immerged the goblet dips, And bears it streaming to my burning lips. There borne aloft on fancy's wing we fly, Like souls embodied to their native sky; Now every rock, each mountain, disappears; And the round earth an even surface wears; When lo! the force of some resistless weight Bears me straight down from that pernicious height; Parting, in vain our struggling arms we close; Abhorred forms, dire phantoms interpose; With trembling voice on thy loved name I call; And gulfs yawn ready to receive my fall. From these fallacious visions of distress I wake; nor are my real sorrows less. Thy absence, Delia, heightens every ill, And gives e'en trivial pains the power to kill. Oh! wert thou near me; yet that wish forbear! 'Twere vain, my love,—'twere vain to wish thee near; Thy tender heart would heave with anguish too, And by partaking, but increase my woe. Alone I'll grieve, till gloomy sorrow past, Health, like the cheerful day-spring, comes at last,— Comes fraught with bliss to banish every pain, Hope, joy, and peace, and Delia in her train! TO DELIA. 1755. Me to whatever state the gods assign, Believe, my love, whatever state be mine, Ne'er shall my breast one anxious sorrow know, Ne'er shall my heart confess a real woe, If to thy share heaven's choicest blessings fall, As thou hast virtue to deserve them all. Yet vain, alas! that idle hope would be That builds on happiness remote from thee. Oh! may thy charms, whate'er our fate decrees, Please, as they must, but let them only please— Not like the sun with equal influence shine, Nor warm with transport any heart but mine. Ye who from wealth the ill-grounded title boast To claim whatever beauty charms you most; Ye sons of fortune, who consult alone Her parents' will, regardless of her own, Know that a love like ours, a generous flame, No wealth can purchase, and no power reclaim. The soul's affection can be only given Free, unextorted, as the grace of heaven. Is there whose faithful bosom can endure Pangs fierce as mine, nor ever hope a cure? Who sighs in absence of the dear-loved maid, Nor summons once Indifference to his aid? Who can, like me, the nice resentment prove, The thousand soft disquietudes of love; The trivial strifes that cause a real pain; The real bliss when reconciled again? Let him alone dispute the real prize, And read his sentence in my Delia's eyes; There shall he read all gentleness and truth, But not himself, the dear distinguish'd youth; Pity for him perhaps they may express— Pity, that will but heighten his distress. But, wretched rival! he must sigh to see The sprightlier rays of love directed all to me. And thou, dear antidote of every pain Which fortune can inflict, or love ordain, Since early love has taught thee to despise What the world's worthless votaries only prize, Believe, my love! no less the generous god Rules in my breast, his ever blest abode; There has he driven each gross desire away, Directing every wish and every thought to thee! Then can I ever leave my Delia's arms, A slave, devoted to inferior charms? Can e'er my soul her reason so disgrace? For what blest minister of heavenly race Would quit that Heaven to find a happier place? ODE SUPPOSED TO BE WRITTEN ON THE MARRIAGE OF A FRIEND. Thou magic lyre whose fascinating sound Seduced the savage monsters from their cave, Drew rocks and trees, and forms uncouth around, And bade wild Hebrus hush his listening wave; No more thy undulating warblings flow O'er Thracian wilds of everlasting snow! Awake to sweeter sounds, thou magic lyre, And paint a lover's bliss—a lover's pain! Far nobler triumphs now thy notes inspire, For see, Eurydice attends thy strain; Her smile, a prize beyond the conjuror's aim, Superior to the cancell'd breath of fame. From her sweet brow to chase the gloom of care, To check that tear that dims the beaming eye, To bid her heart the rising sigh forbear, And flush her orient cheek with brighter joy, In that dear breast soft sympathy to move, And touch the springs of rapture and of love. Ah me! how long bewilder'd and astray, Lost and benighted, did my footsteps rove, Till sent by heaven to cheer my pathless ray, A star arose—the radiant star of love. The God propitious join'd our willing hands, And Hymen wreathed us in his rosy bands. Yet not the beaming eye, or placid brow, Or golden tresses, hid the subtle dart; To charms superior far than those I bow, And nobler worth enslaves my vanquish'd heart; The beauty, elegance, and grace combined, Which beam transcendent from that angel mind. While vulgar passions, meteors of a day, Expire before the chilling blasts of age, Our holy flame with pure and steady ray, Its glooms shall brighten, and its pangs assuage; By Virtue (sacred vestal) fed, shall shine, And warm our fainting souls with energy divine. THE FIFTH SATIRE OF THE FIRST BOOK OF HORACE. PRINTED IN DUNCOMBE'S HORACE. 1759. A HUMOROUS DESCRIPTION OF THE AUTHOR'S JOURNEY FROM ROME TO BRUNDUSIUM. 'Twas a long journey lay before us, When I, and honest Heliodorus, Who far in point of rhetoric Surpasses every living Greek, Each leaving our respective home Together sallied forth from Rome. First at Aricia we alight, And there refresh and pass the night, Our entertainment rather coarse Than sumptuous, but I've met with worse. Thence o'er the causeway soft and fair To Appiiforum we repair. But as this road is well supplied (Temptation strong!) on either side With inns commodious, snug, and warm, We split the journey, and perform In two days' time what's often done By brisker travellers in one. Here, rather choosing not to sup Than with bad water mix my cup, After a warm debate in spite Of a provoking appetite, I sturdily resolved at last To balk it, and pronounce a fast, And in a moody humour wait, While my less dainty comrades bait. Now o'er the spangled hemisphere Diffused the starry train appear, When there arose a desperate brawl; The slaves and bargemen, one and all, Rending their throats (have mercy on us!) As if they were resolved to stun us. “Steer the barge this way to the shore! I tell you we'll admit no more! Plague! will you never be content?” Thus a whole hour at least is spent, While they receive the several fares, And kick the mule into his gears. Happy, these difficulties past, Could we have fallen asleep at last! But, what with humming, croaking, biting, Gnats, frogs, and all their plagues uniting, These tuneful natives of the lake Conspired to keep us broad awake. Besides, to make the concert full, Two maudlin wights, exceeding dull, The bargeman and a passenger, Each in his turn, essay'd an air In honour of his absent fair. At length the passenger, opprest With wine, left off, and snored the rest. The weary bargeman too gave o'er, And hearing his companion snore, Seized the occasion, fix'd the barge, Turn'd out his mule to graze at large, And slept forgetful of his charge. And now the sun o'er eastern hill, Discover'd that our barge stood still; When one, whose anger vex'd him sore, With malice fraught, leaps quick on shore, Plucks up a stake, with many a thwack Assails the mule and driver's back. Then slowly moving on with pain, At ten Feronia's stream we gain, And in her pure and glassy wave Our hands and faces gladly lave. Climbing three miles, fair Anxur's height We reach, with stony quarries white. While here, as was agreed, we wait, Till, charged with business of the state, Mæcenas and Cocceius come, The messengers of peace from Rome. My eyes, by watery humours blear And sore, I with black balsam smear. At length they join us, and with them Our worthy friend Fonteius came; A man of such complete desert, Antony loved him at his heart. At Fundi we refused to bait, And laugh'd at vain Aufidius' state, A prætor now, a scribe before, The purple-border'd robe he wore, His slave the smoking censer bore. Tired at Muræna's we repose, At Formia sup at Capito's. With smiles the rising morn we greet, At Sinuessa pleased to meet With Plotius, Varius, and the bard Whom Mantua first with wonder heard. The world no purer spirits knows; For none my heart more warmly glows. Oh! what embraces we bestow'd, And with what joy our breasts o'erflow'd! Sure while my sense is sound and clear, Long as I live, I shall prefer A gay, good-natured, easy friend, To every blessing Heaven can send. At a small village, the next night, Near the Vulturnus we alight; Where, as employ'd on state affairs, We were supplied by the purveyors Frankly at once, and without hire, With food for man and horse, and fire. Capua next day betimes we reach, Where Virgil and myself, who each Labour'd with different maladies, His such a stomach,—mine such eyes,— As would not bear strong exercise, In drowsy mood to sleep resort; Mæcenas to the tennis-court. Next at Cocceius' farm we're treated, Above the Caudian tavern seated; His kind and hospitable board With choice of wholesome food was stored. Now, O ye Nine, inspire my lays! To nobler themes my fancy raise! Two combatants, who scorn to yield The noisy, tongue-disputed field, Sarmentus and Cicirrus, claim A poet's tribute to their fame; Cicirrus of true Oscian breed, Sarmentus, who was never freed, But ran away. We don't defame him; His lady lives, and still may claim him. Thus dignified, in harder fray These champions their keen wit display, And first Sarmentus led the way. “Thy locks, (quoth he,) so rough and coarse, Look like the mane of some wild horse.” We laugh: Cicirrus undismay'd— “Have at you!”—cries, and shakes his head. “'Tis well (Sarmentus says) you've lost That horn your forehead once could boast; Since maim'd and mangled as you are, You seem to butt.” A hideous scar Improved ('tis true) with double grace The native horrors of his face. Well. After much jocosely said Of his grim front, so fiery red, (For carbuncles had blotch'd it o'er, As usual on Campania's shore) “Give us, (he cried,) since you're so big, A sample of the Cyclops' jig! Your shanks methinks no buskins ask, Nor does your phiz require a mask.” To this Cicirrus. “In return Of you, Sir, now I fain would learn, When 'twas, no longer deem'd a slave, Your chains you to the Lares gave. For though a scrivener's right you claim, Your lady's title is the same. But what could make you run away, Since, pigmy as you are, each day A single pound of bread would quite O'erpower your puny appetite?” Thus joked the champions, while we laugh'd, And many a cheerful bumper quaff'd. To Beneventum next we steer; Where our good host by over care In roasting thrushes lean as mice Had almost fallen a sacrifice. The kitchen soon was all on fire, And to the roof the flames aspire. There might you see each man and master Striving, amidst this sad disaster, To save the supper. Then they came With speed enough to quench the flame. From hence we first at distant see The Apulian hills, well known to me, Parch'd by the sultry western blast; And which we never should have past, Had not Trivicus by the way Received us at the close of day. But each was forced at entering here To pay the tribute of a tear, For more of smoke than fire was seen; The hearth was piled with logs so green. From hence in chaises we were carried Miles twenty-four, and gladly tarried At a small town, whose name my verse (So barbarous is it) can't rehearse. Know it you may by many a sign, Water is dearer far than wine. There bread is deem'd such dainty fare, That every prudent traveller His wallet loads with many a crust; For at Canusium, you might just As well attempt to gnaw a stone As think to get a morsel down. That too with scanty streams is fed; Its founder was brave Diomed. Good Varius (ah, that friends must part!) Here left us all with aching heart. At Rubi we arrived that day, Well jaded by the length of way, And sure poor mortals ne'er were wetter. Next day no weather could be better; No roads so bad; we scarce could crawl Along to fishy Barium's wall. The' Egnatians next, who by the rules Of common sense are knaves or fools, Made all our sides with laughter heave, Since we with them must needs believe, That incense in their temples burns, And without fire to ashes turns. To circumcision's bigots tell Such tales! for me, I know full well, That in high heaven, unmoved by care, The Gods eternal quiet share: Nor can I deem their spleen the cause Why fickle nature breaks her laws. Brundusium last we reach: and there Stop short the Muse and Traveller. THE NINTH SATIRE OF THE FIRST BOOK OF HORACE. THE DESCRIPTION OF AN IMPERTINENT. ADAPTED TO THE PRESENT TIMES, 1759. Sauntering along the street one day, On trifles musing by the way, Up steps a free familiar wight; (I scarcely knew the man by sight.) “Carlos (he cried) your hand, my dear! Gad, I rejoice to meet you here! Pray Heaven I see you well!” “So, so; Even well enough as times now go. The same good wishes, sir, to you.” Finding he still pursued me close, “Sir, you have business, I suppose?” “My business, sir, is quickly done, 'Tis but to make my merit known. Sir, I have read”—“O learned sir, You and your learning I revere.” Then, sweating with anxiety, And sadly longing to get free, Gods, how I scamper'd, scuffled for't, Ran, halted, ran again, stopp'd short, Beckon'd my boy, and pull'd him near, And whisper'd nothing in his ear. Teased with his loose unjointed chat, “What street is this? What house is that?” O Harlow, how I envied thee Thy unabash'd effrontery, Who darest a foe with freedom blame, And call a coxcomb by his name! When I return'd him answer none, Obligingly the fool ran on, “I see you're dismally distress'd, Would give the world to be released, But, by your leave, sir, I shall still Stick to your skirts, do what you will. Pray which way does your journey tend?” “O 'tis a tedious way, my friend, Across the Thames, the Lord knows where: I would not trouble you so far.” “Well, I'm at leisure to attend you.” “Are you? (thought I) the De'il befriend you!” No ass with double panniers rack'd, Oppress'd, o'erladen, broken-back'd, E'er look'd a thousandth part so dull As I, nor half so like a fool. “Sir, I know little of myself, (Proceeds the pert conceited elf,) If Gray or Mason you will deem Than me more worthy your esteem. Poems I write by folios, As fast as other men write prose. Then I can sing so loud, so clear, That Beard cannot with me compare. In dancing too I all surpass, Not Cooke can move with such a grace.” Here I made shift, with much ado, To interpose a word or two.— “Have you no parents, sir, no friends, Whose welfare on your own depends?” “Parents, relations, say you? No. They're all disposed of long ago.”— “Happy to be no more perplex'd! My fate too threatens, I go next. Dispatch me, sir, 'tis now too late, Alas! to struggle with my fate! Well, I'm convinced my time is come. When young, a gipsy told my doom; The beldame shook her palsied head, As she perused my palm, and said, “Of poison, pestilence, or war, Gout, stone, defluxion, or catarrh, You have no reason to beware. Beware the coxcomb's idle prate; Chiefly, my son, beware of that! Be sure, when you behold him, fly Out of all earshot, or you die!” To Rufus' Hall we now draw near, Where he was summon'd to appear, Refute the charge the plaintiff brought, Or suffer judgement by default. “For Heaven's sake, if you love me, wait One moment! I'll be with you straight.” Glad of a plausible pretence— “Sir, I must beg you to dispense With my attendance in the court. My legs will surely suffer for't.”— “Nay, prithee, Carlos, stop awhile!” “Faith, sir, in law I have no skill. Besides, I have no time to spare, I must be going, you know where.” “Well, I protest, I'm doubtful now, Whether to leave my suit or you!” “Me, without scruple! (I reply) Me, by all means, sir!”—“No, not I. Allons, Monsieur!” 'Twere vain (you know) To strive with a victorious foe. So I reluctantly obey, And follow, where he leads the way. “You and Newcastle are so close; Still hand and glove, sir, I suppose.” “Newcastle (let me tell you, sir,) Has not his equal every where.” “Well. There indeed your fortune's made! Faith, sir, you understand your trade. Would you but give me your good word! Just introduce me to my lord. I should serve charmingly by way Of second fiddle, as they say: What think you, sir? 'twere a good jest. 'Slife, we should quickly scout the rest.”— “Sir, you mistake the matter far, We have no second fiddles there.” “Richer than I some folks may be: More learned, but it hurts not me. Friends though he has of different kind, Each has his proper place assign'd.” “Strange matters these alleged by you!”— “Strange they may be, but they are true.”— “Well, then, I vow, 'tis mighty clever, Now I long ten times more than ever To be advanced extremely near One of his shining character. Have but the will—there wants no more, 'Tis plain enough you have the power. His easy temper (that's the worst) He knows, and is so shy at first. But such a cavalier as you— Lord, sir, you'll quickly bring him to! Well; if I fail in my design, Sir, it shall be no fault of mine. If by the saucy servile tribe Denied, what think you of a bribe? Shut out to-day, not die with sorrow, But try my luck again to-morrow. Never attempt to visit him But at the most convenient time, Attend him on each levee day, And there my humble duty pay. Labour, like this, our want supplies; And they must stoop, who mean to rise.” While thus he wittingly harangued, For which you'll guess I wish'd him hang'd, Campley, a friend of mine, came by, Who knew his humour more than I. We stop, salute, and—“why so fast, Friend Carlos? Whither all this haste?” Fired at the thoughts of a reprieve, I pinch him, pull him, twitch his sleeve, Nod, beckon, bite my lips, wink, pout, Do every thing but speak plain out: While he, sad dog, from the beginning Determined to mistake my meaning, Instead of pitying my curse, By jeering made it ten times worse. “Campley, what secret (pray!) was that You wanted to communicate?” “I recollect. But 'tis no matter. Carlos, we'll talk of that hereafter. E'en let the secret rest. 'Twill tell Another time, sir, just as well.” Was ever such a dismal day? Unlucky cur, he steals away, And leaves me, half bereft of life, At mercy of the butcher's knife; When sudden, shouting from afar, See his antagonist appear! The bailiff seized him quick as thought. “Ho, Mr. Scoundrel! Are you caught? Sir, you are witness to the' arrest.” “Aye, marry, sir, I'll do my best.” The mob huzzas. Away they trudge, Culprit and all, before the judge. Meanwhile I luckily enough (Thanks to Apollo) got clear off. ADDRESSED TO MISS MACARTNEY, AFTERWARDS MRS. GREVILLE, ON READING THE PRAYER FOR INDIFFERENCE. 1762. And dwells there in a female heart, By bounteous heaven design'd The choicest raptures to impart, To feel the most refined; Dwells there a wish in such a breast Its nature to forego, To smother in ignoble rest At once both bliss and woe? Far be the thought, and far the strain, Which breathes the low desire, How sweet soe'er the verse complain, Though Phœbus string the lyre. Come then, fair maid, (in nature wise) Who, knowing them, can tell From generous sympathy what joys The glowing bosom swell; In justice to the various powers Of pleasing, which you share, Join me, amid your silent hours, To form the better prayer. With lenient balm may Oberon hence To fairy-land be driven, With ev'ry herb that blunts the sense Mankind received from heaven. “Oh! if my Sov'reign Author please, Far be it from my fate, To live unblest in torpid ease, And slumber on in state; Each tender tie of life defied, Whence social pleasures spring; Unmoved with all the world beside, A solitary thing.” Some Alpine mountain wrapt in snow, Thus braves the whirling blast, Eternal winter doom'd to know, No genial spring to taste; In vain warm suns their influence shed, The zephyrs sport in vain, He rears unchanged his barren head, Whilst beauty decks the plain. What though in scaly armour dress'd, Indifference may repel The shafts of woe, in such a breast No joy can ever dwell. 'Tis woven in the world's great plan, And fix'd by Heaven's decree, That all the true delights of man Should spring from Sympathy. 'Tis nature bids, and whilst the laws Of nature we retain, Our self-approving bosom draws A pleasure from its pain. Thus grief itself has comforts dear, The sordid never know; And ecstasy attends the tear, When virtue bids it flow. For when it streams from that pure source, No bribes the heart can win, To check, or alter from its course The luxury within. Peace to the phlegm of sullen elves, Who, if from labour eased, Extend no care beyond themselves, Unpleasing and unpleased. Let no low thought suggest the prayer! Oh! grant, kind Heaven, to me, Long as I draw ethereal air, Sweet Sensibility! Where'er the heavenly nymph is seen, With lustre-beaming eye, A train, attendant on their queen, (Her rosy chorus) fly. The jocund Loves in Hymen's band, With torches ever bright, And generous Friendship hand in hand, With Pity's watery sight. The gentler Virtues too are join'd, In youth immortal warm, The soft relations which combined Give life her every charm. The Arts come smiling in the close, And lend celestial fire; The marble breathes, the canvass glows, The Muses sweep the lyre. “Still may my melting bosom cleave To sufferings not my own; And still the sigh responsive heave, Where'er is heard a groan. So Pity shall take Virtue's part, Her natural ally, And fashioning my soften'd heart, Prepare it for the sky.” This artless vow may Heaven receive, And you, fond maid, approve; So may your guiding angel give Whate'er you wish or love. So may the rosy-finger'd hours Lead on the various year, And every joy, which now is yours, Extend a larger sphere. And suns to come, as round they wheel, Your golden moments bless, With all a tender heart can feel, Or lively fancy guess. OLNEY HYMNS. I. WALKING WITH GOD. Gen. v. 24. Oh! for a closer walk with God; A calm and heavenly frame; A light to shine upon the road That leads me to the Lamb! Where is the blessedness I knew When first I saw the Lord? Where is the soul-refreshing view Of Jesus and his word? What peaceful hours I once enjoy'd! How sweet their memory still! But they have left an aching void, The world can never fill. Return, O holy Dove, return, Sweet messenger of rest! I hate the sins that made thee mourn, And drove thee from my breast. The dearest idol I have known, Whate'er that idol be, Help me to tear it from thy throne, And worship only Thee. So shall my walk be close with God, Calm and serene my frame; So purer light shall mark the road That leads me to the Lamb. II. JEHOVAH-JIREH. THE LORD WILL PROVIDE. Gen. xxii. 14. The saints should never be dismay'd, Nor sink in hopeless fear; For when they least expect his aid, The Saviour will appear. This Abraham found: he raised the knife; God saw, and said, “Forbear! Yon ram shall yield his meaner life; Behold the victim there.” Once David seem'd Saul's certain prey; But hark! the foe's at hand 1 Sam. xxiii. 27.; Saul turns his arms another way, To save the invaded land. When Jonah sunk beneath the wave, He thought to rise no more Jonah, i. 17.; But God prepared a fish to save, And bear him to the shore. Blest proofs of power and grace divine, That meet us in his word! May every deep-felt care of mine Be trusted with the Lord. Wait for his seasonable aid, And though it tarry, wait: The promise may be long delay'd, But cannot come too late. III. JEHOVAH-ROPHI. I AM THE LORD THAT HEALETH THEE. Exod. xv. 26. Heal us, Emmanuel! here we are, Waiting to feel thy touch: Deep-wounded souls to thee repair, And, Saviour, we are such. Our faith is feeble, we confess, We faintly trust thy word; But wilt thou pity us the less? Be that far from thee, Lord! Remember him who once applied, With trembling, for relief; “Lord, I believe,” with tears he cried Mark, ix 24., “Oh, help my unbelief!” She too, who touch'd thee in the press, And healing virtue stole, Was answer'd, “Daughter, go in peace Mark, v. 34., Thy faith hath made thee whole.” Conceal'd amid the gathering throng, She would have shunn'd thy view; And if her faith was firm and strong, Had strong misgivings too. Like her, with hopes and fears we come, To touch thee, if we may; Oh! send us not despairing home! Send none unheal'd away! IV. JEHOVAH-NISSI. THE LORD MY BANNER. Exod. xvii. 15. By whom was David taught To aim the deadly blow, When he Goliath fought, And laid the Gittite low? Nor sword nor spear the stripling took, But chose a pebble from the brook. 'Twas Israel's God and king Who sent him to the fight; Who gave him strength to sling, And skill to aim aright. Ye feeble saints, your strength endures, Because young David's God is yours. Who order'd Gideon forth, To storm the invaders' camp, With arms of little worth, A pitcher and a lamp Judges, vii. 9, and 20.? The trumpets made his coming known, And all the host was overthrown. Oh! I have seen the day, When with a single word, God helping me to say, “My trust is in the Lord,” My soul hath quell'd a thousand foes, Fearless of all that could oppose. But unbelief, self-will, Self-righteousness, and pride, How often do they steal My weapon from my side! Yet David's Lord, and Gideon's friend, Will help his servant to the end. V. JEHOVAH-SHALOM. THE LORD SEND PEACE. Judges, vi. 24. Jesus! whose blood so freely stream'd To satisfy the law's demand; By thee from guilt and wrath redeem'd, Before the Father's face I stand. To reconcile offending man, Make Justice drop her angry rod; What creature could have form'd the plan, Or who fulfil it but a God? No drop remains of all the curse, For wretches who deserved the whole; No arrows dipt in wrath to pierce The guilty, but returning soul. Peace by such means so dearly bought, What rebel could have hoped to see? Peace, by his injured Sovereign wrought, His Sovereign fasten'd to a tree. Now, Lord, thy feeble worm prepare! For strife with earth and hell begins; Confirm and gird me for the war; They hate the soul that hates his sins. Let them in horrid league agree! They may assault, they may distress; But cannot quench thy love to me, Nor rob me of the Lord my peace. VI. WISDOM. Prov. viii. 22–31. Ere God had built the mountains, Or raised the fruitful hills; Before he fill'd the fountains That feed the running rills; In me, from everlasting, The wonderful I am, Found pleasures never wasting, And Wisdom is my name. When, like a tent to dwell in, He spread the skies abroad, And swathed about the swelling Of Ocean's mighty flood; He wrought by weight and measure, And I was with him then: Myself the Father's pleasure, And mine, the sons of men. Thus Wisdom's words discover Thy glory and thy grace, Thou everlasting lover Of our unworthy race! Thy gracious eye survey'd us Ere stars were seen above; In wisdom thou hast made us, And died for us in love. And couldst thou be delighted With creatures such as we, Who, when we saw thee, slighted, And nail'd thee to a tree? Unfathomable wonder, And mystery divine! The voice that speaks in thunder, Says, “Sinner, I am thine!” VII. VANITY OF THE WORLD. God gives his mercies to be spent; Your hoard will do your soul no good; Gold is a blessing only lent, Repaid by giving others food. The world's esteem is but a bribe, To buy their peace you sell your own; The slave of a vainglorious tribe, Who hate you while they make you known. The joy that vain amusements give, Oh! sad conclusion that it brings! The honey of a crowded hive, Defended by a thousand stings. 'Tis thus the world rewards the fools That live upon her treacherous smiles: She leads them blindfold by her rules, And ruins all whom she beguiles. God knows the thousands who go down From pleasure into endless woe; And with a long despairing groan Blaspheme their Maker as they go. O fearful thought! be timely wise; Delight but in a Saviour's charms, And God shall take you to the skies, Embraced in everlasting arms. VIII. O LORD, I WILL PRAISE THEE. Isaiah, xii. 1. I will praise thee every day Now thine anger's turn'd away; Comfortable thoughts arise From the bleeding sacrifice. Here, in the fair gospel-field, Wells of free salvation yield Streams of life, a plenteous store, And my soul shall thirst no more. Jesus is become at length My salvation and my strength; And his praises shall prolong, While I live, my pleasant song. Praise ye, then, his glorious name, Publish his exalted fame! Still his worth your praise exceeds; Excellent are all his deeds. Raise again the joyful sound, Let the nations roll it round! Zion, shout! for this is he; God the Saviour dwells in thee! IX. THE CONTRITE HEART. Isaiah, lvii. 15. The Lord will happiness divine On contrite hearts bestow; Then tell me, gracious God, is mine A contrite heart, or no? I hear, but seem to hear in vain, Insensible as steel; If ought is felt, 'tis only pain, To find I cannot feel. I sometimes think myself inclined To love thee, if I could; But often feel another mind, Averse to all that's good. My best desires are faint and few, I fain would strive for more; But when I cry, “My strength renew!” Seem weaker than before. Thy saints are comforted, I know, And love thy house of prayer; I therefore go where others go, But find no comfort there. O make this heart rejoice or ache; Decide this doubt for me; And if it be not broken, break,— And heal it if it be! X. THE FUTURE PEACE AND GLORY OF THE CHURCH. Isaiah, ix. 15–20. Hear what God the Lord hath spoken, “O my people, faint and few, Comfortless, afflicted, broken, Fair abodes I build for you. Thorns of heart-felt tribulation Shall no more perplex your ways: You shall name your walls, Salvation, And your gates shall all be Praise. “There, like streams that feed the garden, Pleasures without end shall flow; For the Lord, your faith rewarding, All his bounty shall bestow; Still in undisturb'd possession Peace and righteousness shall reign; Never shall you feel oppression, Hear the voice of war again. “Ye no more your suns descending, Waning moons no more shall see; But, your griefs for ever ending, Find eternal noon in me: God shall rise, and shining o'er ye, Change to day the gloom of night; He, the Lord, shall be your glory, God your everlasting light.” XI. JEHOVAH OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. Jer. xxiii. 6. My God, how perfect are thy ways! But mine polluted are; Sin twines itself about my praise, And slides into my prayer. When I would speak what thou hast done To save me from my sin, I cannot make thy mercies known, But self-applause creeps in. Divine desire, that holy flame Thy grace creates in me; Alas! impatience is its name, When it returns to thee. This heart, a fountain of vile thoughts, How does it overflow, While self upon the surface floats, Still bubbling from below. Let others in the gaudy dress Of fancied merit shine; The Lord shall be my righteousness, The Lord for ever mine. XII. EPHRAIM REPENTING. Jer. xxxi. 18–20. My God, till I received thy stroke, How like a beast was I! So unaccustom'd to the yoke, So backward to comply. With grief my just reproach I bear; Shame fills me at the thought, How frequent my rebellions were, What wickedness I wrought. Thy merciful restraint I scorn'd, And left the pleasant road; Yet turn me, and I shall be turn'd! Thou art the Lord my God. “Is Ephraim banish'd from my thoughts, Or vile in my esteem? No,” saith the Lord, “with all his faults, I still remember him. “Is he a dear and pleasant child? Yes, dear and pleasant still; Though sin his foolish heart beguiled, And he withstood my will. “My sharp rebuke has laid him low, He seeks my face again; My pity kindles at his woe, He shall not seek in vain.” XIII. THE COVENANT. Ezek. xxxvi. 25–28. The Lord proclaims his grace abroad! “Behold, I change your hearts of stone; Each shall renounce his idol-god, And serve, henceforth, the Lord alone. My grace, a flowing stream, proceeds To wash your filthiness away; Ye shall abhor your former deeds, And learn my statutes to obey. My truth the great design ensures, I give myself away to you; You shall be mine, I will be yours, Your God unalterably true. Yet not unsought, or unimplored, The plenteous grace shall I confer Verse 37.; No—your whole hearts shall seek the Lord, I'll put a praying spirit there. From the first breath of life divine, Down to the last expiring hour, The gracious work shall all be mine, Begun and ended in my power. XIV. JEHOVAH-SHAMMAH. Exek. xlviii. 35. As birds their infant brood protect Isaiah, xxxi. 5., And spread their wings to shelter them, Thus saith the Lord to his elect, So will I guard Jerusalem. And what then is Jerusalem, This darling object of his care? Where is its worth in God's esteem? Who built it? who inhabits there? Jehovah founded it in blood, The blood of his incarnate Son; There dwell the saints, once foes to God, The sinners whom he calls his own. There, though besieged on every side, Yet much beloved, and guarded well, From age to age they have defied The utmost force of earth and hell. Let earth repent, and hell despair, This city has a sure defence; Her name is call'd, “The Lord is there,” And who has power to drive him thence? XV. PRAISE FOR THE FOUNTAIN OPENED. Zech. xiii. 1. There is a fountain fill'd with blood Drawn from Emmanuel's veins; And sinners, plunged beneath that flood, Lose all their guilty stains. The dying thief rejoiced to see That fountain in his day; And there have I, as vile as he, Wash'd all my sins away. Dear dying Lamb, thy precious blood Shall never lose its power, Till all the ransom'd church of God Be saved, to sin no more. E'er since, by faith, I saw the stream Thy flowing wounds supply, Redeeming love has been my theme, And shall be till I die. Then in a nobler, sweeter song, I'll sing thy power to save; When this poor lisping stammering tongue Lies silent in the grave. Lord, I believe thou hast prepared (Unworthy though I be) For me a blood-bought free reward, A golden harp for me! 'Tis strung and tuned for endless years, And form'd by power divine, To sound in God the Father's ears No other name but thine. XVI. THE SOWER. Matt. xiii. 3. Ye sons of earth, prepare the plough, Break up your fallow ground; The sower is gone forth to sow, And scatter blessings round. The seed that finds a stony soil Shoots forth a hasty blade; But ill repays the sower's toil, Soon wither'd, scorch'd, and dead. The thorny ground is sure to baulk All hopes of harvest there; We find a tall and sickly stalk, But not the fruitful ear. The beaten path and highway side Receive the trust in vain; The watchful birds the spoil divide, And pick up all the grain. But where the Lord of grace and power Has bless'd the happy field, How plenteous is the golden store The deep-wrought furrows yield! Father of mercies, we have need Of thy preparing grace; Let the same hand that gives the seed Provide a fruitful place! XVII. THE HOUSE OF PRAYER. Mark, xi. 17. Thy mansion is the Christian's heart, O Lord, thy dwelling-place secure! Bid the unruly throng depart, And leave the consecrated door. Devoted as it is to thee, A thievish swarm frequents the place; They steal away my joys from me, And rob my Saviour of his praise. There, too, a sharp designing trade Sin, Satan, and the World maintain; Nor cease to press me, and persuade To part with ease, and purchase pain. I know them, and I hate their din; Am weary of the bustling crowd; But while their voice is heard within, I cannot serve thee as I would. Oh! for the joy thy presence gives, What peace shall reign when thou art there! Thy presence makes this den of thieves A calm delightful house of prayer. And if thou make thy temple shine, Yet, self-abased, will I adore; The gold and silver are not mine; I give thee what was thine before. XVIII. LOVEST THOU ME? John, xxi. 16. Hark, my soul! it is the Lord; 'Tis thy Saviour, hear his word; Jesus speaks, and speaks to thee, “Say, poor sinner, lovest thou me? “I deliver'd thee when bound, And when bleeding, heal'd thy wound; Sought thee wandering, set thee right, Turn'd thy darkness into light. “Can a woman's tender care Cease towards the child she bare? Yes, she may forgetful be, Yet will I remember thee. “Mine is an unchanging love, Higher than the heights above, Deeper than the depths beneath, Free and faithful, strong as death. “Thou shalt see my glory soon, When the work of grace is done; Partner of my throne shalt be;— Say, poor sinner, lovest thou me?” Lord, it is my chief complaint, That my love is weak and faint; Yet I love thee and adore,— Oh! for grace to love thee more! XIX. CONTENTMENT. Phil. iv. 11. Fierce passions discompose the mind, As tempests vex the sea; But calm content and peace we find, When, Lord, we turn to thee. In vain by reason and by rule We try to bend the will; For none but in the Saviour's school Can learn the heavenly skill. Since at his feet my soul has sate, His gracious words to hear, Contented with my present state, I cast on him my care. “Art thou a sinner, soul?” he said, “Then how canst thou complain? How light thy troubles here, if weigh'd With everlasting pain! “If thou of murmuring wouldst be cured, Compare thy griefs with mine; Think what my love for thee endured, And thou wilt not repine. “'Tis I appoint thy daily lot, And I do all things well; Thou soon shalt leave this wretched spot, And rise with me to dwell. “In life my grace shall strength supply, Proportion'd to thy day; At death thou still shalt find me nigh, To wipe thy tears away.” Thus I, who once my wretched days In vain repinings spent, Taught in my Saviour's school of grace, Have learnt to be content. XX. OLD TESTAMENT GOSPEL. Heb. iv. 2. Israel in ancient days Not only had a view Of Sinai in a blaze, But learn'd the Gospel too; The types and figures were a glass, In which they saw a Saviour's face. The paschal sacrifice And blood-besprinkled door Exod. xii. 13., Seen with enlighten'd eyes, And once applied with power, Would teach the need of other blood, To reconcile an angry God. The Lamb, the Dove, set forth His perfect innocence Lev. xii. 6., Whose blood of matchless worth Should be the soul's defence; For he who can for sin atone, Must have no failings of his own. The scape-goat on his head Lev. xvi. 21. The people's trespass bore, And to the desert led, Was to be seen no more: In him our Surety seem'd to say, “Behold, I bear your sins away.” Dipt in his fellow's blood, The living bird went free Lev. xiv. 51–53.; The type, well understood, Express'd the sinner's plea; Described a guilty soul enlarged, And by a Saviour's death discharged. Jesus, I love to trace, Throughout the sacred page, The footsteps of thy grace, The same in every age! O grant that I may faithful be To clearer light vouchsafed to me! XXI. SARDIS. Rev. iii. 1–6. “Write to Sardis,” saith the Lord, “And write what he declares, He whose Spirit, and whose word, Upholds the seven stars: All thy works and ways I search, Find thy zeal and love decay'd; Thou art call'd a living church, But thou art cold and dead. “Watch, remember, seek, and strive, Exert thy former pains; Let thy timely care revive, And strengthen what remains; Cleanse thine heart, thy works amend, Former times to mind recall, Lest my sudden stroke descend, And smite thee once for all. “Yet I number now in thee A few that are upright; These my Father's face shall see, And walk with me in white. When in judgement I appear, They for mine shall be confest; Let my faithful servants hear,— And woe be to the rest!” XXII. PRAYER FOR A BLESSING. Bestow, dear Lord, upon our youth, The gift of saving grace; And let the seed of sacred truth Fall in a fruitful place. Grace is a plant, where'er it grows, Of pure and heavenly root; But fairest in the youngest shows, And yields the sweetest fruit. Ye careless ones, O hear betimes The voice of sovereign love! Your youth is stain'd with many crimes, But mercy reigns above. True, you are young, but there's a stone Within the youngest breast; Or half the crimes which you have done Would rob you of your rest. For you the public prayer is made; Oh! join the public prayer! For you the secret tear is shed; O shed yourselves a tear! We pray that you may early prove The Spirit's power to teach; You cannot be too young to love That Jesus whom we preach. XXIII. PLEADING FOR AND WITH YOUTH. Sin has undone our wretched race; But Jesus has restored, And brought the sinner face to face With his forgiving Lord. This we repeat from year to year, And press upon our youth; Lord, give them an attentive ear, Lord, save them by thy truth! Blessings upon the rising race! Make this a happy hour, According to thy richest grace, And thine almighty power. We feel for your unhappy state, (May you regard it too,) And would awhile ourselves forget To pour out prayer for you. We see, though you perceive it not, The approaching aweful doom; O tremble at the solemn thought And flee the wrath to come! Dear Saviour, let this new-born year Spread an alarm abroad; And cry in every careless ear, “Prepare to meet thy God!” XXIV. PRAYER FOR CHILDREN. Gracious Lord, our children see, By thy mercy we are free; But shall these, alas! remain Subjects still of Satan's reign? Israel's young ones, when of old Pharaoh threaten'd to withhold Exod. x. 9., Then thy messenger said, “No; Let the children also go!” When the angel of the Lord, Drawing forth his dreadful sword, Slew with an avenging hand, All the first-born of the land Exod. xii. 12.; Then thy people's doors he pass'd, Where the bloody sign was placed: Hear us, now, upon our knees, Plead the blood of Christ for these! Lord, we tremble, for we know How the fierce malicious foe, Wheeling round his watchful flight, Keeps them ever in his sight: Spread thy pinions, King of kings! Hide them safe beneath thy wings; Lest the ravenous bird of prey Stoop, and bear the brood away. XXV. JEHOVAH JESUS. My song shall bless the Lord of all, My praise shall climb to his abode; Thee, Saviour, by that name I call, The great supreme, the mighty God. Without beginning or decline, Object of faith and not of sense; Eternal ages saw him shine, He shines eternal ages hence. As much, when in the manger laid, Almighty ruler of the sky, As when the six days' work he made Fill'd all the morning stars with joy. Of all the crowns Jehovah bears, Salvation is his dearest claim; That gracious sound well pleased he hears, And owns Emmanuel for his name. A cheerful confidence I feel, My well placed hopes with joy I see; My bosom glows with heavenly zeal, To worship him who died for me. As man, he pities my complaint, His power and truth are all divine; He will not fail, he cannot faint; Salvation's sure, and must be mine. XXVI. ON OPENING A PLACE FOR SOCIAL PRAYER. Jesus! where'er thy people meet, There they behold thy mercy seat; Where'er they seek thee, Thou art found, And every place is hallowed ground. For thou, within no walls confined, Inhabitest the humble mind; Such ever bring Thee where they come, And going, take Thee to their home. Dear Shepherd of thy chosen few! Thy former mercies here renew; Here to our waiting hearts proclaim The sweetness of thy saving name. Here may we prove the power of prayer, To strengthen faith, and sweeten care; To teach our faint desires to rise, And bring all heaven before our eyes. Behold, at thy commanding word We stretch the curtain and the cord Isaiah, liv. 2.; Come thou, and fill this wider space, And bless us with a large increase. Lord, we are few, but thou art near; Nor short thine arm, nor deaf thine ear; Oh rend the heavens, come quickly down, And make a thousand hearts thine own. XXVII. WELCOME TO THE TABLE. This is the feast of heavenly wine, And God invites to sup; The juices of the living vine Were press'd to fill the Cup. Oh! bless the Saviour, ye that eat, With royal dainties fed; Not heaven affords a costlier treat, For Jesus is the bread. The vile, the lost, he calls to them; Ye trembling souls, appear! The righteous in their own esteem Have no acceptance here. Approach, ye poor, nor dare refuse The banquet spread for you; Dear Saviour, this is welcome news, Then I may venture too. If guilt and sin afford a plea, And may obtain a place, Surely the Lord will welcome me, And I shall see his face. XXVIII. JESUS HASTING TO SUFFER. The Saviour, what a noble flame Was kindled in his breast, When hasting to Jerusalem, He marched before the rest! Good will to men, and zeal for God, His every thought engross; He longs to be baptized with blood Luke, xii. 50., He pants to reach the cross! With all his sufferings full in view, And woes to us unknown, Forth to the task his spirit flew; 'Twas love that urged him on. Lord, we return thee what we can: Our hearts shall sound abroad, Salvation to the dying Man, And to the rising God! And while thy bleeding glories here Engage our wondering eyes, We learn our lighter cross to bear, And hasten to the skies. XXIX. EXHORTATION TO PRAYER. What various hindrances we meet In coming to a mercy seat! Yet who that knows the worth of prayer, But wishes to be often there? Prayer makes the darken'd cloud withdraw, Prayer climbs the ladder Jacob saw, Gives exercise to faith and love, Brings every blessing from above. Restraining prayer, we cease to fight; Prayer makes the Christian's armour bright; And Satan trembles when he sees The weakest saint upon his knees. While Moses stood with arms spread wide, Success was found on Israel's side; But when through weariness they fail'd, That moment Amalek prevail'd Exodus, xvii. 11.. Have you no words? Ah! think again, Words flow apace when you complain, And fill your fellow creature's ear With the sad tale of all your care. Were half the breath thus vainly spent To Heaven in supplication sent, Your cheerful song would oftener be, “Hear what the Lord has done for me.” XXX. THE LIGHT AND GLORY OF THE WORD. The Spirit breathes upon the word, And brings the truth to sight; Precepts and promises afford A sanctifying light. A glory gilds the sacred page, Majestic like the sun; It gives a light to every age, It gives, but borrows none. The hand that gave it still supplies The gracious light and heat; His truths upon the nations rise, They rise, but never set. Let everlasting thanks be thine, For such a bright display, As makes a world of darkness shine With beams of heavenly day. My soul rejoices to pursue The steps of him I love, Till glory break upon my view In brighter worlds above. XXXI. ON THE DEATH OF A MINISTER. His master taken from his head, Elisha saw him go; And in desponding accents said, “Ah, what must Israel do?” But he forgot the Lord who lifts The beggar to the throne; Nor knew, that all Elijah's gifts Would soon be made his own. What! when a Paul has run his course, Or when Apollos dies, Is Israel left without resource, And have we no supplies? Yes, while the dear Redeemer lives, We have a boundless store, And shall be fed with what he gives, Who lives for evermore. XXXII. THE SHINING LIGHT. My former hopes are fled, My terror now begins; I feel, alas! that I am dead In trespasses and sins. Ah, whither shall I fly? I hear the thunder roar; The Law proclaims Destruction nigh, And Vengeance at the door. When I review my ways, I dread impending doom: But sure a friendly whisper says, “Flee from the wrath to come.” I see, or think I see, A glimmering from afar; A beam of day, that shines for me, To save me from despair. Forerunner of the sun Psalm cxxx. 6., It marks the pilgrim's way; I'll gaze upon it while I run, And watch the rising day. XXXIII. THE WAITING SOUL This Hymn, which has not been marked as Cowper's in the Olney Collection, and consequently not included in any edition of his works, is here restored to him on the authority of Mrs. Johnson, the widow of his excellent kinsman.. Breathe from the gentle south, O Lord, And cheer me from the north; Blow on the treasures of thy word, And call the spices forth! I wish, Thou know'st, to be resign'd, And wait with patient hope; But hope delayed fatigues the mind, And drinks the spirits up. Help me to reach the distant goal; Confirm my feeble knee; Pity the sickness of a soul That faints for love of thee! Cold as I feel this heart of mine, Yet, since I feel it so, It yields some hope of life divine Within, however low. I seem forsaken and alone, I hear the lion roar; And every door is shut but one, And that is Mercy's door. There, till the dear Deliverer come, I'll wait with humble prayer; And when he calls his exile home, The Lord shall find him there. XXXIV. SEEKING THE BELOVED. To those who know the Lord I speak; Is my beloved near? The bridegroom of my soul I seek, Oh! when will he appear? Though once a man of grief and shame, Yet now he fills a throne, And bears the greatest, sweetest name, That earth or heaven have known. Grace flies before, and love attends His steps where'er he goes; Though none can see him but his friends, And they were once his foes. He speaks;—obedient to his call Our warm affections move: Did he but shine alike on all, Then all alike would love. Then love in every heart would reign, And war would cease to roar; And cruel and blood-thirsty men Would thirst for blood no more. Such Jesus is, and such his grace; Oh, may he shine on you! And tell him, when you see his face, I long to see him too Cant. v. 8.. XXXV. LIGHT SHINING OUT OF DARKNESS. God moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform; He plants his footsteps in the sea, And rides upon the storm. Deep in unfathomable mines Of never-failing skill, He treasures up his bright designs, And works his sovereign will. Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take, The clouds ye so much dread Are big with mercy, and shall break In blessings on your head. Judge not the Lord by feeble sense, But trust him for his grace; Behind a frowning providence He hides a smiling face. His purposes will ripen fast, Unfolding every hour; The bud may have a bitter taste, But sweet will be the flower. Blind unbelief is sure to err John xiii. 7., And scan his work in vain: God is his own interpreter, And He will make it plain. XXXVI. WELCOME CROSS. 'Tis my happiness below Not to live without the cross, But the Saviour's power to know, Sanctifying every loss: Trials must and will befall; But with humble faith to see Love inscribed upon them all, This is happiness to me. God in Israel sows the seeds Of affliction, pain, and toil; These spring up and choke the weeds Which would else o'erspread the soil: Trials make the promise sweet, Trials give new life to prayer; Trials bring me to his feet, Lay me low, and keep me there. Did I meet no trials here, No chastisement by the way, Might I not with reason fear I should prove a cast-away? Bastards may escape the rod Hebrews xii. 8., Sunk in earthly vain delight; But the true-born child of God Must not,—would not, if he might. XXXVII. AFFLICTIONS SANCTIFIED BY THE WORD. O how I love thy holy word, Thy gracious covenant, O Lord! It guides me in the peaceful way; I think upon it all the day. What are the mines of shining wealth, The strength of youth, the bloom of health! What are all joys compared with those Thine everlasting Word bestows! Long unafflicted, undismay'd, In pleasure's path secure I stray'd; Thou madest me feel thy chastening rod Psalm cxix. 71., And straight I turn'd unto my God. What though it pierced my fainting heart, I bless'd thine hand that caused the smart: It taught my tears awhile to flow, But saved me from eternal woe. Oh! hadst thou left me unchastised, Thy precepts I had still despised; And still the snare in secret laid Had my unwary feet betray'd. I love thee, therefore, O my God, And breathe towards thy dear abode; Where, in thy presence fully blest, Thy chosen saints for ever rest. XXXVIII. TEMPTATION. The billows swell, the winds are high, Clouds overcast my wintry sky; Out of the depths to thee I call,— My fears are great, my strength is small. O Lord, the pilot's part perform, And guard and guide me through the storm; Defend me from each threatening ill, Control the waves,—say, “Peace! be still.” Amidst the roaring of the sea My soul still hangs her hope on thee; Thy constant love, thy faithful care, Is all that saves me from despair. Dangers of every shape and name Attend the followers of the Lamb, Who leave the world's deceitful shore, And leave it to return no more. Though tempest-toss'd and half a wreck, My Saviour through the floods I seek; Let neither winds nor stormy main Force back my shatter'd bark again. XXXIX. LOOKING UPWARDS IN A STORM. God of my life, to thee I call, Afflicted at thy feet I fall; When the great water-floods prevail Psalm lxix. 15., Leave not my trembling heart to fail! Friend of the friendless and the faint, Where should I lodge my deep complaint, Where but with Thee, whose open door Invites the helpless and the poor! Did ever mourner plead with thee, And Thou refuse that mourner's plea? Does not the word still fix'd remain, That none shall seek thy face in vain? That were a grief I could not bear, Didst thou not hear and answer prayer; But a prayer-hearing answering God Supports me under every load. Fair is the lot that's cast for me; I have an Advocate with thee; They whom the world caresses most Have no such privilege to boast. Poor though I am, despised, forgot Psalm xl. 17., Yet God, my God, forgets me not: And he is safe, and must succeed, For whom the Lord vouchsafes to plead. XL. THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH. My soul is sad, and much dismay'd; See, Lord, what legions of my foes, With fierce Apollyon at their head, My heavenly pilgrimage oppose! See, from the ever burning lake, How like a smoky cloud they rise! With horrid blasts my soul they shake, With storms of blasphemies and lies. Their fiery arrows reach the mark Ephes. vi. 16., My throbbing heart with anguish tear; Each lights upon a kindred spark, And finds abundant fuel there. I hate the thought that wrongs the Lord; O! I would drive it from my breast, With thy own sharp two-edged sword, Far as the east is from the west. Come then and chase the cruel host, Heal the deep wounds I have received! Nor let the powers of darkness boast, That I am foil'd, and Thou art grieved! XLI. PEACE AFTER A STORM. When darkness long has veil'd my mind, And smiling day once more appears, Then, my Redeemer, then I find The folly of my doubts and fears. Straight I upbraid my wandering heart, And blush that I should ever be Thus prone to act so base a part, Or harbour one hard thought of Thee! Oh! let me then at length be taught What I am still so slow to learn, That God is Love, and changes not, Nor knows the shadow of a turn. Sweet truth, and easy to repeat! But when my faith is sharply tried, I find myself a learner yet, Unskilful, weak, and apt to slide. But, O my Lord, one look from Thee Subdues the disobedient will, Drives doubt and discontent away, And thy rebellious worm is still. Thou art as ready to forgive As I am ready to repine; Thou, therefore, all the praise receive; Be shame and self-abhorrence mine. XLII. MOURNING AND LONGING. The Saviour hides his face! My spirit thirsts to prove Renew'd supplies of pardoning grace, And never-fading love. The favour'd souls who know What glories shine in him, Pant for his presence as the roe Pants for the living stream. What trifles tease me now! They swarm like summer flies; They cleave to every thing I do, And swim before my eyes. How dull the Sabbath day, Without the Sabbath's Lord! How toilsome then to sing and pray, And wait upon the Word! Of all the truths I hear, How few delight my taste! I glean a berry here and there, But mourn the vintage past. Yet let me (as I ought) Still hope to be supplied; No pleasure else is worth a thought, Nor shall I be denied. Though I am but a worm, Unworthy of his care, The Lord will my desire perform, And grant me all my prayer. XLIII. SELF-ACQUAINTANCE. Dear Lord! accept a sinful heart, Which of itself complains, And mourns, with much and frequent smart, The evil it contains. There fiery seeds of anger lurk, Which often hurt my frame; And wait but for the tempter's work, To fan them to a flame. Legality holds out a bribe To purchase life from thee; And Discontent would fain prescribe How Thou shalt deal with me. While Unbelief withstands thy grace, And puts the mercy by; Presumption, with a brow of brass, Says, “Give me, or I die!” How eager are my thoughts to roam In quest of what they love! But ah! when duty calls them home, How heavily they move! Oh, cleanse me in a Saviour's blood, Transform me by thy power, And make me thy beloved abode, And let me roam no more. XLIV. PRAYER FOR PATIENCE. Lord, who hast suffer'd all for me, My peace and pardon to procure, The lighter cross I bear for thee, Help me with patience to endure. The storm of loud repining hush; I would in humble silence mourn; Why should the unburnt, though burning bush, Be angry as the crackling thorn? Man should not faint at thy rebuke, Like Joshua falling on his face Joshua vii. 10, 11, When the cursed thing that Achan took Brought Israel into just disgrace. Perhaps some golden wedge suppress'd, Some secret sin offends my God; Perhaps that Babylonish vest, Self-righteousness, provokes the rod. Ah! were I buffeted all day, Mock'd, crown'd with thorns, and spit upon, I yet should have no right to say, My great distress is mine alone. Let me not angrily declare No pain was ever sharp like mine, Nor murmur at the cross I bear, But rather weep, remembering thine. XLV. SUBMISSION. O Lord, my best desire fulfill, And help me to resign Life, health, and comfort to thy will, And make thy pleasure mine. Why should I shrink at thy command, Whose love forbids my fears? Or tremble at the gracious hand That wipes away my tears? No, rather let me freely yield What most I prize to thee; Who never hast a good withheld, Or wilt withhold, from me. Thy favour, all my journey through, Thou art engaged to grant; What else I want, or think I do, 'Tis better still to want. Wisdom and mercy guide my way, Shall I resist them both? A poor blind creature of a day, And crush'd before the moth! But ah! my inward spirit cries, Still bind me to thy sway; Else the next cloud that veils the skies Drives all these thoughts away. XLVI. THE HAPPY CHANGE. How bless'd thy creature is, O God, When with a single eye, He views the lustre of thy word, The dayspring from on high! Through all the storms that veil the skies And frown on earthly things, The Sun of Righteousness he eyes, With healing on his wings. Struck by that light, the human heart, A barren soil no more, Sends the sweet smell of grace abroad, Where serpents lurk'd before Isaiah xxxv. 7.. The soul, a dreary province once Of Satan's dark domain, Feels a new empire form'd within, And owns a heavenly reign. The glorious orb whose golden beams The fruitful year control, Since first obedient to thy word, He started from the goal, Has cheer'd the nations with the joys His orient rays impart; But, Jesus, 'tis thy light alone Can shine upon the heart. XLVII. RETIREMENT. Far from the world, O Lord, I flee, From strife and tumult far; From scenes where Satan wages still His most successful war. The calm retreat, the silent shade, With prayer and praise agree; And seem, by thy sweet bounty made, For those who follow Thee. There if thy Spirit touch the soul, And grace her mean abode, Oh, with what peace, and joy, and love, She communes with her God! There like the nightingale she pours Her solitary lays; Nor asks a witness of her song, Nor thirsts for human praise. Author and guardian of my life, Sweet source of light divine, And,—all harmonious names in one,— My Saviour! Thou art mine! What thanks I owe thee, and what love, A boundless, endless store, Shall echo through the realms above When time shall be no more. XLVIII. THE HIDDEN LIFE. To tell the Saviour all my wants, How pleasing is the task! Nor less to praise him when he grants Beyond what I can ask. My labouring spirit vainly seeks To tell but half the joy, With how much tenderness he speaks, And helps me to reply. Nor were it wise, nor should I choose, Such secrets to declare; Like precious wines their taste they lose, Exposed to open air. But this with boldness I proclaim, Nor care if thousands hear, Sweet is the ointment of his name, Not life is half so dear. And can you frown, my former friends, Who knew what once I was, And blame the song that thus commends The Man who bore the cross? Trust me, I draw the likeness true, And not as fancy paints; Such honour may he give to you, For such have all his saints. XLIX. JOY AND PEACE IN BELIEVING. Sometimes a light surprises The Christian while he sings; It is the Lord who rises With healing on his wings: When comforts are declining, He grants the soul again A season of clear shining, To cheer it after rain. In holy contemplation We sweetly then pursue The theme of God's salvation, And find it ever new; Set free from present sorrow, We cheerfully can say, E'en let the unknown to-morrow Matthew, vi. 34. Bring with it what it may! It can bring with it nothing, But He will bear us through; Who gives the lilies clothing, Will clothe his people too; Beneath the spreading heavens No creature but is fed; And He who feeds the ravens Will give his children bread. Though vine nor fig tree neither Habakkuk, iii. 17, 18. Their wonted fruit shall bear, Though all the field should wither, Nor flocks nor herds be there: Yet God the same abiding, His praise shall tune my voice; For, while in him confiding, I cannot but rejoice. L. TRUE PLEASURES. Lord, my soul with pleasure springs When Jesus' name I hear; And when God the Spirit brings The word of promise near: Beauties too, in holiness, Still delighted I perceive; Nor have words that can express The joys thy precepts give. Clothed in sanctity and grace, How sweet it is to see Those who love thee as they pass, Or when they wait on thee. Pleasant too to sit and tell What we owe to love divine; Till our bosoms grateful swell, And eyes begin to shine. Those the comforts I possess, Which God shall still increase, All his ways are pleasantness Prov. iii. 17., And all his paths are peace. Nothing Jesus did or spoke, Henceforth let me ever slight; For I love his easy yoke Matt. xi. 30., And find his burden light. LI. THE CHRISTIAN. Honour and happiness unite To make the Christian's name a praise; How fair the scene, how clear the light, That fills the remnant of his days! A kingly character he bears, No change his priestly office knows; Unfading is the crown he wears, His joys can never reach a close. Adorn'd with glory from on high, Salvation shines upon his face; His robe is of the ethereal dye, His steps are dignity and grace. Inferior honours he disdains, Nor stoops to take applause from earth; The King of kings himself maintains The expenses of his heavenly birth. The noblest creature seen below, Ordain'd to fill a throne above; God gives him all he can bestow, His kingdom of eternal love! My soul is ravish'd at the thought! Methinks from earth I see him rise! Angels congratulate his lot, And shout him welcome to the skies! LII. LIVELY HOPE AND GRACIOUS FEAR. I was a groveling creature once, And basely cleaved to earth; I wanted spirit to renounce The clod that gave me birth. But God has breathed upon a worm, And sent me from above Wings such as clothe an angel's form, The wings of joy and love. With these to Pisgah's top I fly, And there delighted stand, To view beneath a shining sky The spacious promised land. The Lord of all the vast domain Has promised it to me, The length and breadth of all the plain As far as faith can see. How glorious is my privilege! To thee for help I call; I stand upon a mountain's edge, Oh save me, lest I fall! Though much exalted in the Lord, My strength is not my own; Then let me tremble at his word, And none shall cast me down. LIII. FOR THE POOR. When Hagar found the bottle spent, And wept o'er Ishmael, A message from the Lord was sent To guide her to a well Gen. xxi. 19.. Should not Elijah's cake and cruse 1 Kings, xvii. 14. Convince us at this day, A gracious God will not refuse Provisions by the way? His saints and servants shall be fed, The promise is secure; “Bread shall be given them,” as he said, “Their water shall be sure Isa. xxxiii. 16..” Repasts far richer they shall prove, Than all earth's dainties are; 'Tis sweet to taste a Saviour's love, Though in the meanest fare. To Jesus then your trouble bring, Nor murmur at your lot; While you are poor and He is king, You shall not be forgot. LIV. MY SOUL THIRSTETH FOR GOD. I thirst, but not as once I did, The vain delights of earth to share; Thy wounds, Emmanuel, all forbid That I should seek my pleasures there. It was the sight of thy dear cross First wean'd my soul from earthly things; And taught me to esteem as dross The mirth of fools and pomp of kings. I want that grace that springs from thee, That quickens all things where it flows, And makes a wretched thorn like me Bloom as the myrtle, or the rose. Dear fountain of delight unknown! No longer sink below the brim; But overflow, and pour me down A living and life-giving stream! For sure of all the plants that share The notice of thy Father's eye, None proves less grateful to his care, Or yields him meaner fruit than I. LV. LOVE CONSTRAINING TO OBEDIENCE. No strength of nature can suffice To serve the Lord aright: And what she has she misapplies, For want of clearer light. How long beneath the law I lay In bondage and distress; I toil'd the precept to obey, But toil'd without success. Then, to abstain from outward sin Was more than I could do; Now, if I feel its power within, I feel I hate it too. Then all my servile works were done A righteousness to raise; Now, freely chosen in the Son, I freely choose his ways. “What shall I do,” was then the word, “That I may worthier grow?” “What shall I render to the Lord?” Is my inquiry now. To see the law by Christ fulfill'd, And hear his pardoning voice, Changes a slave into a child Romans, iii. 31., And duty into choice. LVI. THE HEART HEALED AND CHANGED BY MERCY. Sin enslaved me many years, And led me bound and blind; Till at length a thousand fears Came swarming o'er my mind. “Where,” said I, in deep distress, “Will these sinful pleasures end? How shall I secure my peace, And make the Lord my friend?” Friends and ministers said much The gospel to enforce; But my blindness still was such, I chose a legal course: Much I fasted, watch'd, and strove, Scarce would show my face abroad, Fear'd almost to speak or move, A stranger still to God. Thus afraid to trust his grace, Long time did I rebel; Till despairing of my case, Down at his feet I fell: Then my stubborn heart he broke, And subdued me to his sway; By a simple word he spoke, “Thy sins are done away.” LVII. HATRED OF SIN. Holy Lord God! I love thy truth, Nor dare thy least commandment slight; Yet pierced by sin, the serpent's tooth, I mourn the anguish of the bite. But though the poison lurks within, Hope bids me still with patience wait; Till death shall set me free from sin, Free from the only thing I hate. Had I a throne above the rest, Where angels and archangels dwell, One sin, unslain, within my breast, Would make that heaven as dark as hell. The prisoner sent to breathe fresh air, And bless'd with liberty again, Would mourn were he condemn'd to wear One link of all his former chain. But, oh! no foe invades the bliss, When glory crowns the Christian's head; One view of Jesus as He is Will strike all sin for ever dead. LVIII. THE NEW CONVERT. The new-born child of gospel grace, Like some fair tree when summer's nigh, Beneath Emmanuel's shining face Lifts up his blooming branch on high. No fears he feels, he sees no foes, No conflict yet his faith employs, Nor has he learnt to whom he owes The strength and peace his soul enjoys. But sin soon darts its cruel sting, And comforts sinking day by day, What seem'd his own, a self-fed spring, Proves but a brook that glides away. When Gideon arm'd his numerous host, The Lord soon made his numbers less; And said, “Lest Israel vainly boast Judges, vii. 2., ‘My arm procured me this success.’” Thus will he bring our spirits down, And draw our ebbing comforts low, That saved by grace, but not our own, We may not claim the praise we owe. LIX. TRUE AND FALSE COMFORTS. O God, whose favourable eye The sin-sick soul revives, Holy and heavenly is the joy Thy shining presence gives. Not such as hypocrites suppose, Who with a graceless heart Taste not of thee, but drink a dose Prepared by Satan's art. Intoxicating joys are theirs, Who while they boast their light, And seem to soar above the stars, Are plunging into night. Lull'd in a soft and fatal sleep, They sin and yet rejoice; Were they indeed the Saviour's sheep, Would they not hear his voice? Be mine the comforts that reclaim The soul from Satan's power; That make me blush for what I am, And hate my sin the more. 'Tis joy enough, my All in All, At thy dear feet to lie; Thou wilt not let me lower fall, And none can higher fly. LX. A LIVING AND A DEAD FAITH. The Lord receives his highest praise From humble minds and hearts sincere; While all the loud professor says Offends the righteous Judge's ear. To walk as children of the day, To mark the precepts' holy light, To wage the warfare, watch, and pray, Show who are pleasing in his sight. Not words alone it cost the Lord, To purchase pardon for his own; Nor will a soul by grace restored Return the Saviour words alone. With golden bells, the priestly vest, And rich pomegranates border'd round Exod. xxviii. 33., The need of holiness express'd, And call'd for fruit as well as sound. Easy indeed it were to reach A mansion in the courts above, If swelling words and fluent speech Might serve instead of faith and love. But none shall gain the blissful blissful place, Or God's unclouded glory see, Who talks of free and sovereign grace, Unless that grace has made him free! LXI. ABUSE OF THE GOSPEL. Too many, Lord, abuse thy grace In this licentious day, And while they boast they see thy face, They turn their own away. Thy book displays a gracious light That can the blind restore; But these are dazzled by the sight, And blinded still the more. The pardon such presume upon, They do not beg, but steal; And when they plead it at thy throne, Oh! where's the Spirit's seal? Was it for this, ye lawless tribe, The dear Redeemer bled? Is this the grace the saints imbibe From Christ the living head? Ah, Lord, we know thy chosen few Are fed with heavenly fare; But these,—the wretched husks they chew, Proclaim them what they are. The liberty our hearts implore Is not to live in sin; But still to wait at Wisdom's door, Till Mercy calls us in. LXII. THE NARROW WAY. What thousands never knew the road! What thousands hate it when 'tis known! None but the chosen tribes of God Will seek or choose it for their own. A thousand ways in ruin end, One only leads to joys on high; By that my willing steps ascend, Pleased with a journey to the sky. No more I ask or hope to find Delight or happiness below; Sorrow may well possess the mind That feeds where thorns and thistles grow. The joy that fades is not for me, I seek immortal joys above; There glory without end shall be The bright reward of faith and love. Cleave to the world, ye sordid worms, Contented lick your native dust! But God shall fight with all his storms, Against the idol of your trust. LXIII. DEPENDENCE. To keep the lamp alive, With oil we fill the bowl; 'Tis water makes the willow thrive, And grace that feeds the soul. The Lord's unsparing hand Supplies the living stream; It is not at our own command, But still derived from him. Beware of Peter's word Matthew, xxvi. 33., Nor confidently say, “I never will deny thee, Lord,”— But,—“Grant I never may.” Man's wisdom is to seek His strength in God alone; And e'en an angel would be weak, Who trusted in his own. Retreat beneath his wings, And in his grace confide! This more exalts the King of kings John, vi. 29. Than all your works beside. In Jesus is our store, Grace issues from his throne; Whoever says, “I want no more,” Confesses he has none. LXIV. NOT OF WORKS. Grace, triumphant in the throne, Scorns a rival, reigns alone; Come and bow beneath her sway! Cast your idol works away! Works of man, when made his plea, Never shall accepted be; Fruits of pride (vain-glorious worm!) Are the best he can perform. Self, the god his soul adores, Influences all his powers; Jesus is a slighted name, Self-advancement all his aim: But when God the Judge shall come, To pronounce the final doom, Then for rocks and hills to hide All his works and all his pride! Still the boasting heart replies, What! the worthy and the wise, Friends to temperance and peace, Have not these a righteousness? Banish every vain pretence Built on human excellence; Perish every thing in man, But the grace that never can. LXV. PRAISE FOR FAITH. Of all the gifts thine hand bestows, Thou Giver of all good! Not heaven itself a richer knows Than my Redeemer's blood. Faith too, the blood-receiving grace, From the same hand we gain! Else, sweetly as it suits our case, That gift had been in vain. Till thou thy teaching power apply, Our hearts refuse to see, And weak, as a distemper'd eye, Shut out the view of thee. Blind to the merits of thy Son, What misery we endure! Yet fly that hand from which alone We could expect a cure. We praise thee, and would praise thee more, To Thee our all we owe; The precious Saviour, and the power That makes Him precious too. LXVI. GRACE AND PROVIDENCE. Almighty King! whose wondrous hand Supports the weight of sea and land; Whose grace is such a boundless store, No heart shall break that sighs for more; Thy providence supplies my food, And 'tis thy blessing makes it good; My soul is nourish'd by thy word, Let soul and body praise the Lord! My streams of outward comfort came From him who built this earthly frame; Whate'er I want his bounty gives, By whom my soul for ever lives. Either his hand preserves from pain, Or, if I feel it, heals again; From Satan's malice shields my breast, Or overrules it for the best. Forgive the song that falls so low Beneath the gratitude I owe! It means thy praise, however poor, An angel's song can do no more. LXVII. I WILL PRAISE THE LORD AT ALL TIMES. Winter has a joy for me, While the Saviour's charms I read, Lowly, meek, from blemish free, In the snowdrop's pensive head. Spring returns, and brings along Life-invigorating suns: Hark! the turtle's plaintive song Seems to speak his dying groans! Summer has a thousand charms, All expressive of his worth; 'Tis his sun that lights and warms, His the air that cools the earth. What! has autumn left to say Nothing of a Saviour's grace? Yes, the beams of milder day Tell me of his smiling face. Light appears with early dawn, While the sun makes haste to rise; See his bleeding beauties drawn On the blushes of the skies. Evening with a silent pace, Slowly moving in the west, Shows an emblem of his grace, Points to an eternal rest. FRAGMENT OF A HYMN. [To Jesus, the Crown of my Hope] To Jesus, the Crown of my Hope, My soul is in haste to be gone: O bear me, ye cherubims, up, And waft me away to his throne! My Saviour, whom absent I love, Whom not having seen I adore; Whose name is exalted above All glory, dominion, and power. ANTI-THELYPHTHORA. A TALE, IN VERSE. ? Ah miser, Quantâ laboras in Charybdi! Horace, lib. i. ode 27. Airy del Castro was as bold a knight As ever earn'd a lady's love in fight. Many he sought, but one above the rest His tender heart victoriously impress'd: In fairy land was born the matchless dame, The land of dreams, Hypothesis her name. There fancy nursed her in ideal bowers, And laid her soft in amaranthine flowers; Delighted with her babe, the enchantress smiled, And graced with all her gifts the favourite child. Her woo'd Sir Airy, by meandering streams, In daily musings and in nightly dreams; With all the flowers he found, he wove in haste Wreaths for her brow, and girdles for her waist; His time, his talents, and his ceaseless care All consecrated to adorn the fair; No pastime but with her he deign'd to take, And,—if he studied, studied for her sake. And for Hypothesis was somewhat long, Nor soft enough to suit a lover's tongue, He called her Posy, with an amorous art, And graved it on a gem, and wore it next his heart. But she, inconstant as the beams that play On rippling waters in an April day, With many a freakish trick deceived his pains, To pathless wilds and unfrequented plains Enticed him from his oaths of knighthood far, Forgetful of the glorious toils of war. 'Tis thus the tenderness that love inspires Too oft betrays the votaries of his fires; Borne far away on elevated wings, They sport like wanton doves in airy rings, And laws and duties are neglected things. Nor he alone address'd the wayward fair; Full many a knight had been entangled there. But still, whoever woo'd her or embraced, On every mind some mighty spell she cast. Some she would teach (for she was wondrous wise, And made her dupes see all things with her eyes,) That forms material, whatsoe'er we dream, Are not at all, or are not what they seem; That substances and modes of every kind Are mere impressions on the passive mind; And he that splits his cranium, breaks at most A fancied head against a fancied post: Others, that earth, ere sin had drown'd it all, Was smooth and even as an ivory ball; That all the various beauties we survey, Hills, valleys, rivers, and the boundless sea, Are but departures from the first design, Effects of punishment and wrath divine. She tutor'd some in Dædalus's art, And promised they should act his wildgoose part, On waxen pinions soar without a fall, Swift as the proudest gander of them all. But fate reserved Sir Airy to maintain The wildest project of her teeming brain; That wedlock is not rigorous as supposed, But man, within a wider pale enclosed, May rove at will, where appetite shall lead, Free as the lordly bull that ranges o'er the mead; That forms and rites are tricks of human law, As idle as the chattering of a daw; That lewd incontinence, and lawless rape, Are marriage in its true and proper shape; That man by faith and truth is made a slave, The ring a bauble, and the priest a knave. Fair fall the deed! the knight exulting cried, Now is the time to make the maid a bride! 'Twas on the noon of an autumnal day, October hight, but mild and fair as May; When scarlet fruits the russet hedge adorn, And floating films envelope every thorn; When gently as in June, the rivers glide, And only miss the flowers that graced their side; The linnet twitter'd out his parting song, With many a chorister the woods among; On southern banks the ruminating sheep, Lay snug and warm;—'twas summer's farewell peep. Propitious to his fond intent there grew An arbour near at hand of thickest yew, With many a boxen bush, close clipt between, And philyrea of a gilded green. But what old Chaucer's merry page befits, The chaster muse of modern days omits. Suffice it then in decent terms to say, She saw,—and turn'd her rosy cheek away. Small need of prayer-book or of priest, I ween, Where parties are agreed, retired the scene, Occasion prompt, and appetite so keen. Hypothesis (for with such magic power Fancy endued her in her natal hour,) From many a steaming lake and reeking bog, Bade rise in haste a dank and drizzling fog, That curtain'd round the scene where they reposed, And wood and lawn in dusky folds enclosed. Fear seized the trembling sex; in every grove They wept the wrongs of honourable love. In vain, they cried, are hymeneal rites, Vain our delusive hope of constant knights; The marriage bond has lost its power to bind, And flutters loose, the sport of every wind. The bride, while yet her bride's attire is on, Shall mourn her absent lord, for he is gone, Satiate of her, and weary of the same, To distant wilds in quest of other game. Ye fair Circassians! all your lutes employ, Seraglios sing, and harams dance for joy! For British nymphs whose lords were lately true, Nymphs quite as fair, and happier once than you, Honour, esteem, and confidence forgot, Feel all the meanness of your slavish lot. Oh curst Hypothesis! your hellish arts Seduce our husbands, and estrange their hearts.— Will none arise? no knight who still retains The blood of ancient worthies in his veins, To assert the charter of the chaste and fair, Find out her treacherous heart, and plant a dagger there! A knight—(can he that serves the fair do less) Starts at the call of beauty in distress; And he that does not, whatsoe'er occurs, Is recreant, and unworthy of his spurs When a knight was degraded, his spurs were chopped off. C.. Full many a champion, bent on hardy deed, Call'd for his arms and for his princely steed. So swarm'd the Sabine youth, and grasp'd the shield, When Roman rapine, by no laws withheld, Lest Rome should end with her first founders' lives, Made half their maids, sans ceremony, wives. But not the mitred few, the soul their charge, They left these bodily concerns at large; Forms or no forms, pluralities or pairs, Right reverend sirs! was no concern of theirs. The rest, alert and active as became A courteous knighthood, caught the generous flame; One was accoutred when the cry began, Knight of the Silver Moon, Sir Marmadan Monthly Review for October. C.. Oft as his patroness, who rules the night, Hangs out her lamp in yon cærulean height, His vow was, (and he well perform'd his vow,) Arm'd at all points, with terror on his brow, To judge the land, to purge atrocious crimes, And quell the shapeless monsters of the times. For cedars famed, fair Lebanon supplied The well-poised lance that quiver'd at his side; Truth arm'd it with a point so keen, so just, No spell or charm was proof against the thrust. He couch'd it firm upon his puissant thigh, And darting through his helm an eagle's eye, On all the wings of chivalry advanced To where the fond Sir Airy lay entranced. He dreamt not of a foe, or if his fear Foretold one, dreamt not of a foe so near. Far other dreams his feverish mind employ'd, Of rights restored, variety enjoy'd; Of virtue too well fenced to fear a flaw; Vice passing current by the stamp of law; Large population on a liberal plan, And woman trembling at the foot of man; How simple wedlock fornication works, And Christians marrying may convert the Turks. The trumpet now spoke Marmadan at hand, A trumpet that was heard though all the land. His high-bred steed expands his nostrils wide, And snorts aloud to cast the mist aside; But he, the virtues of his lance to show, Struck thrice the point upon his saddle bow; Three sparks ensued that chased it all away, And set the unseemly pair in open day. “To horse!” he cried, “or, by this good right hand And better spear, I smite you where you stand.” Sir Airy, not a whit dismay'd or scared, Buckled his helm, and to his steed repair'd; Whose bridle, while he cropp'd the grass below, Hung not far off upon a myrtle bough. He mounts at once,—such confidence infused The insidious witch that had his wits abused; And she, regardless of her softer kind, Seized fast the saddle and sprang up behind. “Oh shame to knighthood!” his assailant cried; “Oh shame!” ten thousand echoing nymphs replied. Placed with advantage at his listening ear, She whisper'd still that he had nought to fear; That he was cased in such enchanted steel, So polish'd and compact from head to heel, “Come ten, come twenty, should an army call Thee to the field, thou shouldst withstand them all.” “By Dian's beams,” Sir Marmadan exclaim'd, “The guiltiest still are ever least ashamed! But guard thee well, expect no feign'd attack; And guard beside the sorceress at thy back!” He spoke indignant, and his spurs applied, Though little need, to his good palfrey's side; The barb sprang forward, and his lord, whose force Was equal to the swiftness of his horse, Rush'd with a whirlwind's fury on the foe, And, Phineas like, transfixed them at a blow. Then sang the married and the maiden throng, Love graced the theme, and harmony the song; The Fauns and Satyrs, a lascivious race, Shriek'd at the sight, and, conscious, fled the place: And Hymen, trimming his dim torch anew, His snowy mantle o'er his shoulders threw; He turn'd, and view'd it oft on every side, And reddening with a just and generous pride, Bless'd the glad beams of that propitious day, The spot he loath'd so much for ever cleansed away. TABLE TALK. Si te fortè meæ gravis uret sarcina chartæ Abjicito. Hor. lib. i. epis. 13. A. You told me, I remember, glory built On selfish principles is shame and guilt; The deeds that men admire as half divine, Stark naught, because corrupt in their design. Strange doctrine this! that without scruple tears The laurel that the very lightning spares, Brings down the warrior's trophy to the dust, And eats into his bloody sword like rust. B. I grant, that men continuing what they are, Fierce, avaricious, proud, there must be war; And never meant the rule should be applied To him that fights with justice on his side. Let laurels, drench'd in pure Parnassian dews, Reward his memory, dear to every muse, Who, with a courage of unshaken root, In honour's field advancing his firm foot, Plants it upon the line that justice draws, And will prevail or perish in her cause. 'Tis to the virtues of such men, man owes His portion in the good that heaven bestows; And when recording history displays Feats of renown, though wrought in ancient days, Tells of a few stout hearts that fought and died Where duty placed them, at their country's side, The man that is not moved with what he reads, That takes not fire at their heroic deeds, Unworthy of the blessings of the brave, Is base in kind, and born to be a slave. But let eternal infamy pursue The wretch to nought but his ambition true, Who, for the sake of filling with one blast The post-horns of all Europe, lays her waste. Think yourself station'd on a towering rock, To see a people scatter'd like a flock, Some royal mastiff panting at their heels, With all the savage thirst a tiger feels, Then view him self-proclaim'd in a gazette, Chief monster that has plagued the nations yet! The globe and sceptre in such hands misplaced, Those ensigns of dominion, how disgraced! The glass that bids man mark the fleeting hour, And death's own scythe would better speak his power. Then grace the bony phantom in their stead With the king's shoulder knot and gay cockade, Clothe the twin brethren in each other's dress, The same their occupation and success. A. 'Tis your belief the world was made for man; Kings do but reason on the selfsame plan: Maintaining your's, you cannot their's condemn, Who think, or seem to think, man made for them. B. Seldom, alas! the power of logic reigns With much sufficiency in royal brains. Such reasoning falls like an inverted cone, Wanting its proper base to stand upon. Man made for kings! those optics are but dim That tell you so;—say, rather, they for him. That were indeed a king-ennobling thought, Could they, or would they, reason as they ought. The diadem with mighty projects lined, To catch renown by ruining mankind, Is worth, with all its gold and glittering store, Just what the toy will sell for, and no more. Oh! bright occasions of dispensing good, How seldom used, how little understood! To pour in virtue's lap her just reward, Keep vice restrain'd behind a double guard, To quell the faction that affronts the throne, By silent magnanimity alone; To nurse with tender care the thriving arts, Watch every beam philosophy imparts; To give religion her unbridled scope, Nor judge by statute a believer's hope; With close fidelity and love unfeign'd, To keep the matrimonial bond unstain'd; Covetous only of a virtuous praise, His life a lesson to the land he sways; To touch the sword with conscientious awe, Nor draw it but when duty bids him draw; To sheath it in the peace-restoring close, With joy, beyond what victory bestows,— Blest country! where these kingly glories shine, Blest England! if this happiness be thine. A. Guard what you say; the patriotic tribe Will sneer and charge you with a bribe.— B. A bribe? The worth of his three kingdoms I defy, To lure me to the baseness of a lie. And of all lies, (be that one poet's boast,) The lie that flatters I abhor the most. Those arts be their's that hate his gentle reign; But he that loves him has no need to feign. A. Your smooth eulogium to one crown address'd, Seems to imply a censure on the rest. B. Quevedo, as he tells his sober tale, Ask'd, when in hell, to see the royal jail, Approved their method in all other things, “But where, good sir, do you confine your kings?” “There,” said his guide, “the groupe is full in view.” “Indeed!” replied the Don—“there are but few.” His black interpreter the charge disdain'd;— “Few, fellow? There are all that ever reign'd.” Wit undistinguishing is apt to strike The guilty and not guilty, both alike. I grant the sarcasm is too severe, And we can readily refute it here, While Alfred's name, the father of his age, And the Sixth Edward's grace the historic page. A. Kings then at last have but the lot of all; By their own conduct they must stand or fall. B. True. While they live, the courtly laureate pays His quit-rent ode, his pepper-corn of praise, And many a dunce whose fingers itch to write, Adds, as he can, his tributary mite; A subject's faults a subject may proclaim, A monarch's errors are forbidden game. Thus free from censure (overawed by fear,) And praised for virtues that they scorn to wear, The fleeting forms of majesty engage Respect, while stalking o'er life's narrow stage, Then leave their crimes for history to scan, And ask with busy scorn, Was this the man? I pity kings whom worship waits upon Obsequious, from the cradle to the throne, Before whose infant eyes the flatterer bows, And binds a wreath about their baby brows; Whom education stiffens into state, And death awakens from that dream too late. Oh! if servility, with supple knees, Whose trade it is to smile, to crouch, to please; If smooth dissimulation, skill'd to grace A devil's purpose with an angel's face; If smiling peeresses and simpering peers, Encompassing his throne a few short years; If the gilt carriage and the pamper'd steed, That wants no driving and disdains the lead; If guards, mechanically form'd in ranks, Playing, at beat of drum, their martial pranks; Shouldering and standing, as if struck to stone, While condescending majesty looks on; If monarchy consist in such base things, Sighing, I say again, I pity kings! To be suspected, thwarted, and withstood, Even when he labours for his country's good; To see a band call'd patriot for no cause, But that they catch at popular applause, Careless of all the anxiety he feels, Hook disappointment on the public wheels, With all their flippant fluency of tongue, Most confident, when palpably most wrong,— If this be kingly, then farewell for me All kingship, and may I be poor and free! To be the Table Talk of clubs up stairs, To which the unwash'd artificer repairs, To indulge his genius after long fatigue, By diving into cabinet intrigue, (For what kings deem a toil, as well they may, To him is relaxation and mere play;)— To win no praise when well-wrought plans prevail, But to be rudely censured when they fail; To doubt the love his favourites may pretend, And in reality to find no friend; If he indulge a cultivated taste, His galleries with the works of art well graced, To hear it call'd extravagance and waste; If these attendants, and if such as these, Must follow royalty, then welcome ease! However humble and confined the sphere, Happy the state that has not these to fear. A. Thus men, whose thoughts contemplative have dwelt On situations that they never felt, Start up sagacious, cover'd with the dust Of dreaming study and pedantic rust, And prate and preach about what others prove, As if the world and they were hand and glove. Leave kingly backs to cope with kingly cares, They have their weight to carry, subjects their's; Poets, of all men, ever least regret Increasing taxes and the nation's debt. Could you contrive the payment, and rehearse The mighty plan, oracular, in verse, No bard, howe'er majestic, old or new, Should claim my fix'd attention more than you. B. Not Brindley nor Bridgewater would essay To turn the course of Helicon that way; Nor would the nine consent, the sacred tide Should purl amidst the traffic of Cheapside, Or tinkle in 'Change Alley, to amuse The leathern ears of stock-jobbers and Jews. A. Vouchsafe, at least, to pitch the key of rhime To themes more pertinent, if less sublime. When ministers and ministerial arts, Patriots who love good places at their hearts, When admirals extoll'd for standing still, Or doing nothing with a deal of skill; Generals who will not conquer when they may, Firm friends to peace, to pleasure, and good pay, When freedom wounded almost to despair, Though discontent alone can find out where, When themes like these employ the poet's tongue, I hear,—as mute as if a siren sung. Or tell me, if you can, what power maintains A Briton's scorn of arbitrary chains? That were a theme might animate the dead, And move the lips of poets cast in lead. B. The cause, though worth the search, may yet elude Conjecture and remark, however shrewd. They take, perhaps, a well-directed aim, Who seek it in his climate and his frame. Liberal in all things else, yet nature here With stern severity deals out the year. Winter invades the spring, and often pours A chilling flood on summer's drooping flowers; Unwelcome vapours quench autumnal beams, Ungenial blasts attending, curl the streams; The peasants urge their harvest, ply the fork With double toil, and shiver at their work. Thus with a rigour, for his good design'd, She rears her favourite man of all mankind. His form robust and of elastic tone, Proportion'd well, half muscle and half bone, Supplies with warm activity and force A mind well lodged, and masculine of course. Hence liberty, sweet liberty inspires, And keeps alive his fierce but noble fires. Patient of constitutional control, He bears it with meek manliness of soul, But if authority grow wanton, woe To him that treads upon his free-born toe! One step beyond the boundary of the laws Fires him at once in freedom's glorious cause. Thus proud prerogative, not much revered, Is seldom felt, though sometimes seen and heard; And in his cage, like parrot fine and gay, Is kept to strut, look big, and talk away. Born in a climate softer far than our's, Not form'd like us, with such Herculean powers, The Frenchman, easy, debonair, and brisk, Give him his lass, his fiddle, and his frisk, Is always happy, reign whoever may, And laughs the sense of misery far away. He drinks his simple beverage with a gust, And feasting on an onion and a crust, We never feel the alacrity and joy With which he shouts and carols, Vive le Roy, Fill'd with as much true merriment and glee, As if he heard his king say—Slave, be free! Thus happiness depends, as nature shows, Less on exterior things than most suppose. Vigilant over all that he has made, Kind Providence attends with gracious aid, Bids equity throughout his works prevail, And weighs the nations in an even scale; He can encourage slavery to a smile, And fill with discontent a British isle. A. Freeman and slave then, if the case be such, Stand on a level,—and you prove too much. If all men indiscriminately share His fostering power and tutelary care, As well be yoked by despotism's hand, As dwell at large in Britain's charter'd land. B. No. Freedom has a thousand charms to show, That slaves, howe'er contented, never know. The mind attains beneath her happy reign The growth that nature meant she should attain. The varied fields of science, ever new, Opening and wider opening on her view, She ventures onward with a prosperous force, While no base fear impedes her in her course. Religion, richest favour of the skies, Stands most reveal'd before the freeman's eyes; No shades of superstition blot the day, Liberty chases all that gloom away; The soul, emancipated, unoppress'd, Free to prove all things, and hold fast the best, Learns much, and to a thousand listening minds Communicates with joy the good she finds. Courage in arms, and ever prompt to show His manly forehead to the fiercest foe; Glorious in war, but for the sake of peace, His spirits rising as his toils increase, Guards well what arts and industry have won, And Freedom claims him for her first-born son. Slaves fight for what were better cast away, The chain that binds them, and a tyrant's sway; But they that fight for freedom, undertake The noblest cause mankind can have at stake, Religion, virtue, truth, whate'er we call A blessing, freedom is the pledge of all. Oh liberty! the prisoner's pleasing dream, The poet's muse, his passion and his theme, Genius is thine, and thou art fancy's nurse, Lost without thee the ennobling powers of verse; Heroic song from thy free touch acquires Its clearest tone, the rapture it inspires. Place me where winter breathes his keenest air, And I will sing if liberty be there; And I will sing at liberty's dear feet, In Afric's torrid clime or India's fiercest heat. A. Sing where you please, in such a cause I grant An English poet's privilege to rant. But is not freedom, at least is not our's, Too apt to play the wanton with her powers, Grow freakish, and o'erleaping every mound Spread anarchy and terror all around? B. Agreed. But would you sell or slay your horse For bounding and curvetting in his course; Or if, when ridden with a careless rein, He break away, and seek the distant plain? No. His high mettle, under good control, Gives him Olympic speed, and shoots him to the goal. Let discipline employ her wholesome arts; Let magistrates alert perform their parts, Not skulk, or put on a prudential mask, As if their duty were a desperate task; Let active laws apply the needful curb To guard the peace that riot would disturb, And liberty preserved from wild excess, Shall raise no feuds for armies to suppress. When tumult lately burst his prison door, And set Plebeian thousands in a roar, When he usurp'd authority's just place, And dared to look his master in the face, When the rude rabble's watchword was, destroy! And blazing London seem'd a second Troy, Liberty blush'd, and hung her drooping head, Beheld their progress with the deepest dread, Blush'd that effects like these she should produce, Worse than the deeds of galley-slaves broke loose. She loses in such storms her very name, And fierce licentiousness should bear the blame. Incomparable gem! thy worth untold, Cheap, though blood-bought, and thrown away when sold; May no foes ravish thee, and no false friend Betray thee, while professing to defend; Prize it ye ministers, ye monarchs spare, Ye patriots guard it with a miser's care! A. Patriots, alas! the few that have been found Where most they flourish, upon English ground, The country's need have scantily supplied; And the last left the scene when Chatham died. B. Not so—the virtue still adorns our age, Though the chief actor died upon the stage. In him, Demosthenes was heard again, Liberty taught him her Athenian strain; She cloth'd him with authority and awe, Spoke from his lips, and in his looks gave law. His speech, his form, his action, full of grace, And all his country beaming in his face, He stood, as some inimitable hand Would strive to make a Paul or Tully stand. No sycophant or slave that dared oppose Her sacred cause, but trembled when he rose, And every venal stickler for the yoke, Felt himself crush'd at the first word he spoke. Such men are raised to station and command, When Providence means mercy to a land. He speaks, and they appear; to him they owe Skill to direct, and strength to strike the blow, To manage with address, to seize with power The crisis of a dark decisive hour. So Gideon earn'd a victory not his own, Subserviency his praise, and that alone. Poor England! thou art a devoted deer, Beset with every ill but that of fear. The nations hunt; all mark thee for a prey, They swarm around thee, and thou stand'st at bay, Undaunted still, though wearied and perplex'd; Once Chatham saved thee, but who saves thee next? Alas! the tide of pleasure sweeps along All that should be the boast of British song. 'Tis not the wreath that once adorn'd thy brow, The prize of happier times, will serve thee now. Our ancestry, a gallant christian race, Patterns of every virtue, every grace, Confess'd a God; they kneel'd before they fought, And praised him in the victories he wrought. Now from the dust of ancient days bring forth Their sober zeal, integrity, and worth; Courage, ungraced by these, affronts the skies, Is but the fire without the sacrifice. The stream that feeds the well-spring of the heart Not more invigorates life's noblest part, Than virtue quickens with a warmth divine The powers that sin has brought to a decline. A. The inestimable estimate of Brown, Rose like a paper-kite, and charm'd the town; But measures plann'd and executed well, Shifted the wind that raised it, and it fell. He trod the very selfsame ground you tread, And victory refuted all he said. B. And yet his judgement was not framed amiss, Its error, if it err'd, was merely this,— He thought the dying hour already come, And a complete recovery struck him dumb. But that effeminacy, folly, lust, Enervate and enfeeble, and needs must, And that a nation shamefully debased Will be despised and trampled on at last, Unless sweet penitence her powers renew, Is truth, if history itself be true. There is a time, and justice marks the date, For long-forbearing clemency to wait; That hour elapsed, the incurable revolt Is punish'd, and down comes the thunder-bolt. If mercy then put by the threat'ning blow, Must she perform the same kind office now? May she! and if offended heaven be still Accessible, and prayer prevail, she will. 'Tis not however insolence and noise, The tempest of tumultuary joys, Nor is it yet despondence and dismay, Will win her visits, or engage her stay; Prayer only, and the penitential tear, Can call her smiling down, and fix her here. But when a country—(one that I could name) In prostitution sinks the sense of shame, When infamous venality grown bold, Writes on his bosom, to be let or sold; When perjury, that heaven-defying vice, Sells oaths by tale, and at the lowest price, Stamps God's own name upon a lie just made, To turn a penny in the way of trade; When avarice starves, and never hides his face, Two or three millions of the human race, And not a tongue enquires how, where, or when, Though conscience will have twinges now and then; When profanation of the sacred cause In all its parts, times, ministry, and laws, Bespeaks a land once christian, fallen and lost In all that wars against that title most; What follows next, let cities of great name, And regions long since desolate proclaim: Nineveh, Babylon, and ancient Rome, Speak to the present times and times to come, They cry aloud in every careless ear, “Stop, while ye may, suspend your mad career! O learn from our example and our fate,— Learn wisdom and repentance ere too late!” Not only vice disposes and prepares The mind that slumbers sweetly in her snares, To stoop to tyranny's usurp'd command, And bend her polish'd neck beneath his hand, (A dire effect, by one of nature's laws Unchangeably connected with its cause,) But Providence himself will intervene To throw his dark displeasure o'er the scene. All are his instruments; each form of war, What burns at home, or threatens from afar, Nature in arms, her elements at strife, The storms that overset the joys of life, Are but his rods to scourge a guilty land, And waste it at the bidding of his hand. He gives the word, and mutiny soon roars In all her gates, and shakes her distant shores; The standards of all nations are unfurl'd, She has one foe, and that one foe, the world. And if he doom that people with a frown, And mark them with the seal of wrath, press'd down, Obduracy takes place; callous and tough, The reprobated race grows judgement-proof; Earth shakes beneath them, and heaven roars above, But nothing scares them from the course they love; To the lascivious pipe and wanton song, That charm down fear, they frolic it along, With mad rapidity and unconcern, Down to the gulf from which is no return. They trust in navies, and their navies fail, God's curse can cast away ten thousand sail; They trust in armies, and their courage dies; In wisdom, wealth, in fortune, and in lies; But all they trust in withers, as it must, When He commands, in whom they place no trust. Vengeance at last pours down upon their coast, A long despised, but now victorious host; Tyranny sends the chain that must abridge The noble sweep of all their privilege, Gives liberty the last, the mortal shock, Slips the slave's collar on, and snaps the lock. A. Such lofty strains embellish what you teach, Mean you to prophesy, or but to preach? B. I know the mind that feels indeed the fire The muse imparts, and can command the lyre, Acts with a force, and kindles with a zeal, Whate'er the theme, that others never feel. If human woes her soft attention claim, A tender sympathy pervades the frame, She pours a sensibility divine Along the nerve of every feeling line. But if a deed not tamely to be borne, Fire indignation and a sense of scorn, The strings are swept with such a power, so loud, The storm of music shakes the astonish'd crowd. So when remote futurity is brought Before the keen enquiry of her thought, A terrible sagacity informs The poet's heart, he looks to distant storms, He hears the thunder ere the tempest lowers, And arm'd with strength surpassing human powers, Seizes events as yet unknown to man, And darts his soul into the dawning plan. Hence, in a Roman mouth, the graceful name Of prophet and of poet was the same; Hence British poets too the priesthood shared, And every hallow'd druid was a bard. But no prophetic fires to me belong, I play with syllables, and sport in song. A. At Westminster, where little poets strive To set a distich upon six and five, Where discipline helps opening buds of sense, And makes his pupils proud with silver pence, I was a poet too;—but modern taste Is so refined and delicate and chaste, That verse, whatever fire the fancy warms, Without a creamy smoothness has no charms. Thus, all success depending on an ear, And thinking I might purchase it too dear, If sentiment were sacrificed to sound, And truth cut short to make a period round, I judged a man of sense could scarce do worse Than caper in the morris-dance of verse. B. Thus reputation is a spur to wit, And some wits flag through fear of losing it. Give me the line that ploughs its stately course Like a proud swan, conquering the stream by force; That like some cottage beauty strikes the heart, Quite unindebted to the tricks of art. When labour and when dullness, club in hand, Like the two figures at St. Dunstan's stand, Beating alternately, in measured time, The clockwork tintinabulum of rhyme, Exact and regular the sounds will be, But such mere quarter-strokes are not for me. From him who rears a poem lank and long, To him who strains his all into a song, Perhaps some bonny Caledonian air, All birks and braes, though he was never there; Or having whelp'd a prologue with great pains, Feels himself spent, and fumbles for his brains; A prologue interdash'd with many a stroke, An art contrived to advertise a joke, So that the jest is clearly to be seen, Not in the words—but in the gap between; Manner is all in all, whate'er is writ, The substitute for genius, sense, and wit. To dally much with subjects mean and low, Proves that the mind is weak, or makes it so. Neglected talents rust into decay, And every effort ends in push-pin play. The man that means success, should soar above A soldier's feather, or a lady's glove, Else summoning the Muse to such a theme, The fruit of all her labour is whipt-cream. As if an eagle flew aloft, and then— Stoop'd from his highest pitch to pounce a wren. As if the poet purposing to wed, Should carve himself a wife in gingerbread. Ages elapsed ere Homer's lamp appear'd, And ages ere the Mantuan swan was heard; To carry nature lengths unknown before, To give a Milton birth, ask'd ages more. Thus genius rose and set at order'd times, And shot a day-spring into distant climes, Ennobling every region that he chose, He sunk in Greece, in Italy he rose, And tedious years of Gothic darkness past, Emerged all splendour in our isle at last. Thus lovely Halcyons dive into the main, Then show far off their shining plumes again. A. Is genius only found in epic lays? Prove this, and forfeit all pretence to praise. Make their heroic powers your own at once, Or candidly confess yourself a dunce. B. These were the chief; each interval of night Was graced with many an undulating light; In less illustrious bards his beauty shone A meteor or a star; in these, the sun. The nightingale may claim the topmost bough, While the poor grasshopper must chirp below. Like him unnoticed, I, and such as I, Spread little wings, and rather skip than fly; Perch'd on the meagre produce of the land, An ell or two of prospect we command, But never peep beyond the thorny bound, Or oaken fence, that hems the paddock round. In Eden ere yet innocence of heart Had faded, poetry was not an art; Language above all teaching, or if taught, Only by gratitude and glowing thought, Elegant as simplicity, and warm As ecstasy, unmanacled by form, Not prompted, as in our degenerate days, By low ambition and the thirst of praise, Was natural as is the flowing stream, And yet magnificent, a God the theme. That theme on earth exhausted, though above 'Tis found as everlasting as his love, Man lavish'd all his thoughts on human things, The feats of heroes and the wrath of kings, But still while virtue kindled his delight, The song was moral, and so far was right. 'Twas thus till luxury seduced the mind To joys less innocent, as less refined, Then genius danced a bacchanal, he crown'd The brimming goblet, seized the thyrsus, bound His brows with ivy, rush'd into the field Of wild imagination, and there reel'd The victim of his own lascivious fires, And dizzy with delight, profaned the sacred wires. Anacreon, Horace, play'd in Greece and Rome This Bedlam part; and, others nearer home. When Cromwell fought for power, and while he reign'd The proud protector of the power he gain'd, Religion harsh, intolerant, austere, Parent of manners like herself severe, Drew a rough copy of the Christian face Without the smile, the sweetness, or the grace; The dark and sullen humour of the time Judged every effort of the Muse a crime; Verse in the finest mould of fancy cast, Was lumber in an age so void of taste: But when the second Charles assumed the sway, And arts revived beneath a softer day, Then like a bow long forced into a curve, The mind released from too constrain'd a nerve, Flew to its first position with a spring That made the vaulted roofs of pleasure ring. His court, the dissolute and hateful school Of wantonness, where vice was taught by rule, Swarm'd with a scribbling herd as deep inlaid With brutal lust as ever Circe made. From these a long succession, in the rage Of rank obscenity debauch'd their age, Nor ceased, till ever anxious to redress The abuses of her sacred charge, the press, The Muse instructed a well nurtured train Of abler votaries to cleanse the stain, And claim the palm for purity of song, That lewdness had usurped and worn so long. Then decent pleasantry and sterling sense That neither gave nor would endure offence, Whipp'd out of sight with satire just and keen, The puppy pack that had defiled the scene. In front of these came Addison. In him Humour in holiday and sightly trim, Sublimity and attic taste combined, To polish, furnish, and delight the mind. Then Pope, as harmony itself exact, In verse well disciplined, complete, compact, Gave virtue and morality a grace That quite eclipsing pleasure's painted face, Levied a tax of wonder and applause, Even on the fools that trampled on their laws. But he, (his musical finesse was such, So nice his ear, so delicate his touch) Made poetry a mere mechanic art, And every warbler has his tune by heart. Nature imparting her satiric gift, Her serious mirth, to Arbuthnot and Swift, With droll sobriety they raised a smile At folly's cost, themselves unmoved the while. That constellation set, the world in vain Must hope to look upon their like again. A. Are we then left— B. Not wholly in the dark: Wit now and then, struck smartly, shows a spark, Sufficient to redeem the modern race From total night and absolute disgrace. While servile trick and imitative knack Confine the million in the beaten track, Perhaps some courser who disdains the road, Snuffs up the wind and flings himself abroad. Contemporaries all surpass'd, see one, Short his career, indeed, but ably run. Churchill, himself unconscious of his powers, In penury consumed his idle hours, And like a scattered seed at random sown, Was left to spring by vigour of his own. Lifted at length by dignity of thought, And dint of genius to an affluent lot, He laid his head in luxury's soft lap, And took too often there his easy nap. If brighter beams than all he threw not forth, 'Twas negligence in him, not want of worth. Surly and slovenly and bold and coarse, Too proud for art, and trusting in mere force, Spendthrift alike of money and of wit, Always at speed, and never drawing bit, He struck the lyre in such a careless mood, And so disdain'd the rules he understood, The laurel seem'd to wait on his command, He snatch'd it rudely from the Muse's hand. Nature exerting an unwearied power, Forms, opens and gives scent to every flower, Spreads the fresh verdure of the field, and leads The dancing Naiads through the dewy meads, She fills profuse ten thousand little throats With music, modulating all their notes, And charms the woodland scenes and wilds unknown, With artless airs and concerts of her own; But seldom (as if fearful of expense) Vouchsafes to man a poet's just pretence. Fervency, freedom, fluency of thought, Harmony, strength, words exquisitely sought, Fancy that from the bow that spans the sky, Brings colours dipt in heaven that never die, A soul exalted above earth, a mind Skill'd in the characters that form mankind,— And as the sun in rising beauty dress'd, Looks to the westward from the dappled east, And marks, whatever clouds may interpose, Ere yet his race begins, its glorious close, An eye like his to catch the distant goal, Or ere the wheels of verse begin to roll, Like his to shed illuminating rays On every scene and subject it surveys,— Thus graced the man asserts a poet's name, And the world cheerfully admits the claim. Pity! Religion has so seldom found A skilful guide into poetic ground! The flowers would spring where'er she deign'd to stray, And every Muse attend her in her way. Virtue indeed meets many a rhyming friend, And many a compliment politely penn'd, But unattired in that becoming vest Religion weaves for her, and half undress'd, Stands in the desert shivering and forlorn, A wintry figure, like a wither'd thorn. The shelves are full, all other themes are sped; Hackney'd and worn to the last flimsy thread, Satire has long since done his best, and curst And loathsome ribaldry has done his worst; Fancy has sported all her powers away In tales, in trifles, and in children's play, And 'tis the sad complaint, and almost true, Whate'er we write, we bring forth nothing new. 'Twere new indeed, to see a bard all fire, Touch'd with a coal from heaven, assume the lyre, And tell the world, still kindling as he sung, With more than mortal music on his tongue, That He who died below, and reigns above Inspires the song, and that his name is Love. For after all, if merely to beguile By flowing numbers and a flowery style The tædium that the lazy rich endure, Which now and then sweet poetry may cure, Or if to see the name of idol self Stamp'd on the well-bound quarto, grace the shelf, To float a bubble on the breath of fame, Prompt his endeavour, and engage his aim, Debased to servile purposes of pride, How are the powers of genius misapplied! The gift whose office is the giver's praise, To trace him in his word, his works, his ways, Then spread the rich discovery, and invite Mankind to share in the divine delight, Distorted from its use and just design, To make the pitiful possessor shine, To purchase at the fool-frequented fair Of vanity, a wreath for self to wear, Is profanation of the basest kind, Proof of a trifling and a worthless mind. A. Hail Sternhold then and Hopkins hail! B. Amen. If flattery, folly, lust employ the pen, If acrimony, slander and abuse, Give it a charge to blacken and traduce; Though Butler's wit, Pope's numbers, Prior's ease, With all that fancy can invent to please, Adorn the polish'd periods as they fall, One madrigal of theirs is worth them all. A. 'Twould thin the ranks of the poetic tribe, To dash the pen through all that you proscribe. B. No matter;—we could shift when they were not, And should no doubt if they were all forgot. THE PROGRESS OF ERROR. Si quid loquar audiendum. —Hor. lib. iv. od. 2. Sing, Muse, (if such a theme, so dark, so long, May find a Muse to grace it with a song,) By what unseen and unsuspected arts The serpent Error twines round human hearts, Tell where she lurks, beneath what flowery shades That not a glimpse of genuine light pervades, The poisonous, black, insinuating worm Successfully conceals her loathsome form. Take, if ye can, ye careless and supine! Counsel and caution from a voice like mine; Truths that the theorist could never reach, And observation taught me, I would teach. Not all whose eloquence the fancy fills, Musical as the chime of tinkling rills, Weak to perform, though mighty to pretend, Can trace her mazy windings to their end, Discern the fraud beneath the specious lure, Prevent the danger, or prescribe the cure. The clear harangue, and cold as it is clear, Falls soporific on the listless ear; Like quicksilver, the rhetoric they display Shines as it runs, but grasp'd at slips away. Placed for his trial on this bustling stage, From thoughtless youth to ruminating age, Free in his will to choose or to refuse, Man may improve the crisis, or abuse. Else, on the fatalist's unrighteous plan, Say, to what bar amenable were man? With nought in charge, he could betray no trust, And if he fell, would fall because he must; If love reward him, or if vengeance strike, His recompense in both, unjust alike. Divine authority within his breast Brings every thought, word, action to the test, Warns him or prompts, approves him or restrains, As reason, or as passion, takes the reins. Heaven from above, and Conscience from within, Cry in his startled ear, “Abstain from sin!” The world around solicits his desire, And kindles in his soul a treacherous fire, While all his purposes and steps to guard, Peace follows virtue as its sure reward, And pleasure brings as surely in her train, Remorse and sorrow and vindictive pain. Man thus endued with an elective voice, Must be supplied with objects of his choice. Where'er he turns, enjoyment and delight, Or present, or in prospect, meet his sight; These open on the spot their honey'd store, Those call him loudly to pursuit of more. His unexhausted mine, the sordid vice Avarice shows, and virtue is the price. Here, various motives his ambition raise, Power, pomp, and splendour, and the thirst of praise; There beauty woos him with expanded arms; E'en Bacchanalian madness has its charms. Nor these alone, whose pleasures less refined Might well alarm the most unguarded mind, Seek to supplant his unexperienced youth, Or lead him devious from the path of truth; Hourly allurements on his passions press, Safe in themselves, but dangerous in the excess. Hark! how it floats upon the dewy air;— O what a dying, dying close was there! 'Tis harmony from yon sequestered bower, Sweet harmony that soothes the midnight hour; Long ere the charioteer of day had run His morning course, the enchantment was begun, And he shall gild yon mountains height again, Ere yet the pleasing toil becomes a pain. Is this the rugged path, the steep ascent That virtue points to? Can a life thus spent Lead to the bliss she promises the wise, Detach the soul from earth, and speed her to the skies? Ye devotees to your adored employ, Enthusiasts, drunk with an unreal joy, Love makes the music of the blest above, Heaven's harmony is universal love; And earthly sounds, though sweet and well combined, And lenient as soft opiates to the mind, Leave vice and folly unsubdued behind. Grey dawn appears, the sportsman and his train Speckle the bosom of the distant plain; 'Tis he, the Nimrod of the neighbouring lairs, Save that his scent is less acute than theirs, For persevering chase and headlong leaps, True beagle as the staunchest hound he keeps. Charged with the folly of his life's mad scene, He takes offence, and wonders what you mean; The joy, the danger and the toil o'erpays; 'Tis exercise, and health, and length of days. Again impetuous to the field he flies, Leaps every fence but one, there falls and dies; Like a slain deer, the tumbril brings him home, Unmiss'd but by his dogs and by his groom. Ye clergy, while your orbit is your place, Lights of the world, and stars of human race,— But if eccentric ye forsake your sphere, Prodigious, ominous, and view'd with fear, The comet's baneful influence is a dream, Yours real, and pernicious in the extreme. What then,—are appetites and lusts laid down, With the same ease the man puts on his gown? Will avarice and concupiscence give place, Charm'd by the sounds, your reverence, or your grace? No. But his own engagement binds him fast; Or if it does not, brands him to the last What atheists call him, a designing knave, A mere church juggler, hypocrite, and slave. Oh laugh, or mourn with me, the rueful jest, A cassock'd huntsman, and a fiddling priest; He from Italian songsters takes his cue, Set Paul to music, he shall quote him too. He takes the field, the master of the pack Cries, Well done, Saint!—and claps him on the back. Is this the path of sanctity? Is this To stand a way-mark in the road to bliss? Himself a wanderer from the narrow way, His silly sheep, what wonder if they stray? Go, cast your orders at your Bishop's feet, Send your dishonour'd gown to Monmouth Street, The sacred function, in your hands is made, Sad sacrilege! no function, but a trade. Occiduus is a pastor of renown; When he has pray'd and preach'd the sabbath down, With wire and catgut he concludes the day, Quavering and semiquavering care away. The full concerto swells upon your ear; All elbows shake. Look in, and you would swear The Babylonian tyrant with a nod Had summon'd them to serve his golden god. So well that thought the employment seems to suit, Psaltery and sackbut, dulcimer and flute. Oh fie! 'Tis evangelical and pure; Observe each face, how sober and demure! Ecstasy sets her stamp on every mien, Chins fallen, and not an eye-ball to be seen. Still I insist, though music heretofore Has charm'd me much, not even Occiduus more, Love, joy, and peace make harmony more meet For sabbath evenings, and perhaps as sweet. Will not the sickliest sheep of every flock Resort to this example as a rock, There stand and justify the foul abuse Of sabbath hours, with plausible excuse? If apostolic gravity be free To play the fool on Sundays, why not we? If he the tinkling harpsichord regards As inoffensive, what offence in cards? Strike up the fiddles! let us all be gay! Laymen have leave to dance, if parsons play. Oh Italy! Thy sabbaths will be soon Our sabbaths, closed with mummery and buffoon. Preaching and pranks will share the motley scene, Ours parcell'd out, as thine have ever been, God's worship and the mountebank between. What says the prophet? Let that day be blest With holiness and consecrated rest. Pastime and business both it should exclude, And bar the door the moment they intrude, Nobly distinguish'd above all the six, By deeds in which the world must never mix. Hear him again. He calls it a delight, A day of luxury, observed aright, When the glad soul is made heaven's welcome guest, Sits banqueting, and God provides the feast. But triflers are engaged and cannot come; Their answer to the call is—Not at home. Oh the dear pleasures of the velvet plain, The painted tablets, dealt and dealt again. Cards with what rapture, and the polish'd die, The yawning chasm of indolence supply! Then to the dance, and make the sober moon Witness of joys that shun the sight of noon. Blame, cynic, if you can, quadrille or ball, The snug close party, or the splendid hall, Where night down-stooping from her ebon throne, Views constellations brighter than her own. 'Tis innocent, and harmless, and refined, The balm of care, elysium of the mind. Innocent!—Oh, if venerable time Slain at the foot of pleasure be no crime, Then with his silver beard and magic wand, Let Comus rise Archbishop of the land, Let him your rubric and your feasts prescribe, Grand metropolitan of all the tribe. Of manners rough, and coarse athletic cast, The rank debauch suits Clodio's filthy taste. Rufillus, exquisitely form'd by rule, Not of the moral, but the dancing school, Wonders at Clodio's follies, in a tone As tragical, as others at his own. He cannot drink five bottles, bilk the score, Then kill a constable, and drink five more; But he can draw a pattern, make a tart, And has the ladies' etiquette by heart. Go, fool, and arm in arm with Clodio plead Your cause before a bar you little dread; But know, the law that bids the drunkard die Is far too just to pass the trifler by. Both baby-featured and of infant size, View'd from a distance, and with heedless eyes, Folly and innocence are so alike, The difference, though essential, fails to strike. Yet folly ever has a vacant stare, A simpering countenance, and a trifling air; But innocence, sedate, serene, erect, Delights us, by engaging our respect. Man, Nature's guest by invitation sweet, Receives from her both appetite and treat; But if he play the glutton and exceed, His benefactress blushes at the deed. For nature, nice, as liberal to dispense, Made nothing but a brute the slave of sense. Daniel ate pulse by choice,—example rare! Heaven bless'd the youth, and made him fresh and fair. Gorgonius sits abdominous and wan, Like a fat squab upon a Chinese fan; He snuffs far off the anticipated joy, Turtle and venison all his thoughts employ, Prepares for meals, as jockeys take a sweat, Oh nauseous! an emetic for a whet,— Will Providence o'erlook the wasted good? Temperance were no virtue if he could. That pleasures, therefore, or what such we call, Are hurtful, is a truth confess'd by all. And some that seem to threaten virtue less, Still hurtful, in the abuse, or by the excess. Is man then only for his torment placed, The centre of delights he may not taste? Like fabled Tantalus condemn'd to hear The precious stream still purling in his ear, Lip-deep in what he longs for, and yet curst With prohibition and perpetual thirst? No, wrangler,—destitute of shame and sense! The precept that enjoins him abstinence, Forbids him none but the licentious joy, Whose fruit, though fair, tempts only to destroy. Remorse, the fatal egg by pleasure laid In every bosom where her nest is made, Hatch'd by the beams of truth, denies him rest, And proves a raging scorpion in his breast. No pleasure? Are domestic comforts dead? Are all the nameless sweets of friendship fled? Has time worn out, or fashion put to shame Good sense, good health, good conscience, and good fame? All these belong to virtue, and all prove That virtue has a title to your love. Have you no touch of pity, that the poor Stand starved at your inhospitable door? Or if yourself, too scantily supplied, Need help, let honest industry provide. Earn, if you want; if you abound, impart; These both are pleasures to the feeling heart. No pleasure? Has some sickly eastern waste Sent us a wind to parch us at a blast? Can British paradise no scenes afford To please her sated and indifferent lord? Are sweet philosophy's enjoyments run Quite to the lees? And has religion none? Brutes capable, should tell you 'tis a lie, And judge you from the kennel and the sty. Delights like these, ye sensual and profane, Ye are bid, begg'd, besought to entertain; Call'd to these crystal streams, do ye turn off Obscene, to swill and swallow at a trough? Envy the beast then, on whom heaven bestows Your pleasures, with no curses in the close! Pleasure admitted in undue degree, Enslaves the will, nor leaves the judgement free. 'Tis not alone the grape's enticing juice Unnerves the moral powers, and mars their use, Ambition, avarice, and the lust of fame, And woman, lovely woman, does the same. The heart, surrendered to the ruling power Of some ungovern'd passion every hour, Finds, by degrees, the truths that once bore sway, And all their deep impression wear away. So coin grows smooth, in traffic current pass'd, 'Till Cæsar's image is effaced at last. The breach, though small at first, soon opening wide, In rushes folly with a full moon tide. Then welcome errors of whatever size, To justify it by a thousand lies. As creeping ivy clings to wood or stone, And hides the ruin that it feeds upon, So sophistry cleaves close to and protects Sin's rotten trunk, concealing its defects. Mortals whose pleasures are their only care, First wish to be imposed on, and then are; And lest the fulsome artifice should fail, Themselves will hide its coarseness with a veil. Not more industrious are the just and true To give to virtue what is virtue's due, The praise of wisdom, comeliness, and worth, And call her charms to public notice forth, Than vice's mean and disingenuous race To hide the shocking features of her face: Her form with dress and lotion they repair, Then kiss their idol, and pronounce her fair. The sacred implement I now employ Might prove a mischief, or at best a toy, A trifle if it move but to amuse, But if to wrong the judgement and abuse, Worse than a poniard in the basest hand, It stabs at once the morals of a land. Ye writers of what none with safety reads, Footing it in the dance that fancy leads, Ye novelists, who mar what ye would mend, Sniveling and driveling folly without end, Whose corresponding misses fill the ream With sentimental frippery and dream, Caught in a delicate soft silken net By some lewd Earl or rake-hell Baronet; Ye pimps, who, under virtue's fair pretence, Steal to the closet of young innocence, And teach her, unexperienced yet and green, To scribble as you scribble, at fifteen; Who kindling a combustion of desire, With some cold moral think to quench the fire, Though all your engineering proves in vain, The dribbling stream ne'er puts it out again; Oh that a verse had power, and could command Far, far away these fleshflies of the land, Who fasten without mercy on the fair, And suck, and leave a craving maggot there. Howe'er disguised the inflammatory tale, And covered with a fine-spun specious veil, Such writers and such readers owe the gust And relish of their pleasure all to lust. But the muse, eagle-pinion'd, has in view A quarry more important still than you; Down, down the wind she swims and sails away, Now stoops upon it, and now grasps the prey. Petronius! all the muses weep for thee, But every tear shall scald thy memory. The graces too, while virtue at their shrine Lay bleeding under that soft hand of thine, Felt each a mortal stab in her own breast, Abhorr'd the sacrifice, and cursed the priest. Thou polish'd and high-finish'd foe to truth, Gray-beard corruptor of our listening youth, To purge and skim away the filth of vice, That so refined it might the more entice, Then pour it on the morals of thy son To taint his heart, was worthy of thine own. Now while the poison all high life pervades, Write if thou canst one letter from the shades, One, and one only, charged with deep regret, That thy worst part, thy principles, live yet; One sad epistle thence may cure mankind Of the plague spread by bundles left behind. 'Tis granted, and no plainer truth appears, Our most important are our earliest years. The mind impressible and soft, with ease Imbibes and copies what she hears and sees, And through life's labyrinth holds fast the clue That education gives her, false or true. Plants raised with tenderness are seldom strong; Man's coltish disposition asks the thong, And without discipline the favourite child, Like a neglected forester, runs wild. But we, as if good qualities would grow Spontaneous, take but little pains to sow; We give some Latin and a smatch of Greek, Teach him to fence and figure twice a week, And having done, we think, the best we can, Praise his proficiency and dub him man. From school to Cam or Isis, and thence home, And thence with all convenient speed to Rome, With reverend tutor clad in habit lay, To tease for cash, and quarrel with all day; With memorandum-book for every town, And every post, and where the chaise broke down; His stock, a few French phrases got by heart, With much to learn, but nothing to impart, The youth, obedient to his sire's commands, Sets off a wanderer into foreign lands: Surprised at all they meet, the gosling pair With awkward gait, stretch'd neck, and silly stare, Discover huge cathedrals built with stone, And steeples towering high much like our own, But show peculiar light by many a grin At Popish practices observed within. Ere long some bowing, smirking, smart Abbé Remarks two loiterers that have lost their way, And being always primed with politesse For men of their appearance and address, With much compassion undertakes the task, To tell them more than they have wit to ask. Points to inscriptions wheresoe'er they tread, Such as when legible were never read, But being canker'd now, and half worn out, Craze antiquarian brains with endless doubt: Some headless hero or some Cæsar shows, Defective only in his Roman nose; Exhibits elevations, drawings, plans, Models of Herculanean pots and pans, And sells them medals, which if neither rare Nor ancient, will be so, preserved with care. Strange the recital! from whatever cause His great improvement and new lights he draws, The 'Squire once bashful is shamefaced no more, But teems with powers he never felt before: Whether increased momentum, and the force With which from clime to clime he sped his course, As axles sometimes kindle as they go, Chafed him and brought dull nature to a glow; Or whether clearer skies and softer air, That make Italian flowers so sweet and fair, Freshening his lazy spirits as he ran, Unfolded genially and spread the man, Returning, he proclaims by many a grace, By shrugs and strange contortions of his face, How much a dunce that has been sent to roam, Excels a dunce that has been kept at home. Accomplishments have taken virtue's place, And wisdom falls before exterior grace; We slight the precious kernel of the stone, And toil to polish its rough coat alone. A just deportment, manners graced with ease, Elegant phrase, and figure form'd to please, Are qualities that seem to comprehend Whatever parents, guardians, schools intend. Hence an unfurnish'd and a listless mind, Though busy, trifling; empty, though refined; Hence all that interferes, and dares to clash With indolence and luxury, is trash; While learning, once the man's exclusive pride, Seems verging fast towards the female side. Learning itself, received into a mind By nature weak, or viciously inclined, Serves but to lead philosophers astray Where children would with ease discern the way. And of all arts sagacious dupes invent To cheat themselves and gain the world's assent, The worst is scripture warp'd from its intent. The carriage bowls along and all are pleased If Tom be sober, and the wheels well greased; But if the rogue have gone a cup too far, Left out his linch-pin or forgot his tar, It suffers interruption and delay, And meets with hinderance in the smoothest way. When some hypothesis absurd and vain Has fill'd with all its fumes a critic's brain, The text that sorts not with his darling whim, Though plain to others, is obscure to him. The will made subject to a lawless force, All is irregular and out of course, And judgement drunk, and bribed to lose his way, Winks hard, and talks of darkness at noonday. A critic on the sacred book should be Candid and learn'd, dispassionate and free; Free from the wayward bias bigots feel, From fancy's influence, and intemperate zeal. But above all (or let the wretch refrain, Nor touch the page he cannot but profane,) Free from the domineering power of lust, A lewd interpreter is never just. How shall I speak thee, or thy power address, Thou God of our idolatry, the press? By thee, religion, liberty, and laws Exert their influence, and advance their cause; By thee, worse plagues than Pharaoh's land befel, Diffused, make earth the vestibule of hell: Thou fountain, at which drink the good and wise, Thou ever-bubbling spring of endless lies, Like Eden's dread probationary tree, Knowledge of good and evil is from thee. No wild enthusiast ever yet could rest, Till half mankind were like himself possess'd. Philosophers, who darken and put out Eternal truth by everlasting doubt, Church quacks, with passions under no command, Who fill the world with doctrines contraband, Discoverers of they know not what, confined Within no bounds, the blind that lead the blind, To streams of popular opinion drawn, Deposit in those shallows all their spawn. The wriggling fry soon fill the creeks around, Poisoning the waters where their swarms abound; Scorn'd by the nobler tenants of the flood, Minnows and gudgeons gorge the unwholesome food. The propagated myriads spread so fast, Even Leuwenhoek himself would stand aghast, Employed to calculate the enormous sum, And own his crab-computing powers o'ercome. Is this hyperbole? The world well known, Your sober thoughts will hardly find it one. Fresh confidence the speculatist takes From every hare-brain'd proselyte he makes, And therefore prints:—Himself but half deceived, 'Till others have the soothing tale believed. Hence comment after comment, spun as fine As bloated spiders draw the flimsy line; Hence the same word that bids our lusts obey Is misapplied to sanctify their sway. If stubborn Greek refuse to be his friend, Hebrew or Syriac shall be forced to bend; If languages and copies all cry, No!— Somebody proved it centuries ago. Like trout pursued, the critic in despair Darts to the mud and finds his safety there. Women, whom custom has forbid to fly The scholar's pitch, (the scholar best knows why) With all the simple and unlettered poor, Admire his learning, and almost adore. Whoever errs, the priest can ne'er be wrong, With such fine words familiar to his tongue. Ye ladies! (for, indifferent in your cause, I should deserve to forfeit all applause,) Whatever shocks, or gives the least offence To virtue, delicacy, truth, or sense, (Try the criterion, 'tis a faithful guide,) Nor has, nor can have scripture on its side. None but an author knows an author's cares, Or fancy's fondness for the child she bears. Committed once into the public arms, The baby seems to smile with added charms. Like something precious ventured far from shore, 'Tis valued for the dangers sake the more. He views it with complacency supreme, Solicits kind attention to his dream, And daily more enamour'd of the cheat, Kneels, and asks heaven to bless the dear deceit. So one, whose story serves at least to show Men loved their own productions long ago, Wooed an unfeeling statue for his wife, Nor rested till the Gods had given it life. If some mere driveler suck the sugar'd fib, One that still needs his leading-string and bib, And praise his genius, he is soon repaid In praise applied to the same part, his head. For 'tis a rule that holds for ever true, Grant me discernment, and I grant it you. Patient of contradiction as a child, Affable, humble, diffident, and mild, Such was Sir Isaac, and such Boyle and Locke; Your blunderer is as sturdy as a rock. The creature is so sure to kick and bite, A muleteer's the man to set him right. First appetite enlists him truth's sworn foe, Then obstinate self-will confirms him so. Tell him he wanders, that his error leads To fatal ills, that though the path he treads Be flowery, and he see no cause of fear, Death and the pains of Hell attend him there; In vain; the slave of arrogance and pride, He has no hearing on the prudent side. His still refuted quirks he still repeats, New raised objections with new quibbles meets, Till sinking in the quicksand he defends, He dies disputing, and the contest ends; But not the mischiefs: they still left behind, Like thistle-seeds are sown by every wind. Thus men go wrong with an ingenious skill, Bend the straight rule to their own crooked will, And with a clear and shining lamp supplied, First put it out, then take it for a guide. Halting on crutches of unequal size, One leg by truth supported, one by lies, They sidle to the goal with awkward pace, Secure of nothing, but to lose the race. Faults in the life breed errors in the brain, And these, reciprocally, those again. The mind and conduct mutually imprint And stamp their image in each other's mint. Each, sire and dam of an infernal race, Begetting and conceiving all that's base. None sends his arrow to the mark in view, Whose hand is feeble, or his aim untrue. For though ere yet the shaft is on the wing, Or when it first forsakes the elastic string, It err but little from the intended line, It falls at last, far wide of his design. So he that seeks a mansion in the sky, Must watch his purpose with a steadfast eye; That prize belongs to none but the sincere, The least obliquity is fatal here. With caution taste the sweet Circæan cup, He that sips often, at last drinks it up. Habits are soon assumed, but when we strive To strip them off, 'tis being flay'd alive. Call'd to the temple of impure delight, He that abstains, and he alone, does right. If a wish wander that way, call it home; He cannot long be safe whose wishes roam. But if you pass the threshold, you are caught; Die then, if power Almighty save you not! There hardening by degrees, till double steel'd, Take leave of nature's God, and God reveal'd; Then laugh at all you trembled at before, And joining the freethinkers' brutal roar, Swallow the two grand nostrums they dispense, That scripture lies, and blasphemy is sense; If clemency revolted by abuse Be damnable, then, damn'd without excuse. Some dream that they can silence when they will The storm of passion, and say, Peace, be still; But “Thus far and no farther,” when address'd To the wild wave, or wilder human breast, Implies authority that never can, That never ought to be the lot of man. But, muse, forbear, long flights forebode a fall, Strike on the deep-toned chord the sum of all. Hear the just law, the judgement of the skies! He that hates truth shall be the dupe of lies. And he that will be cheated to the last, Delusions, strong as Hell, shall bind him fast. But if the wanderer his mistake discern, Judge his own ways, and sigh for a return, Bewildered once, must he bewail his loss For ever and for ever? No—the Cross! There and there only, (though the deist rave, And atheist, if earth bear so base a slave) There and there only, is the power to save. There no delusive hope invites despair, No mockery meets you, no deception there. The spells and charms that blinded you before, All vanish there, and fascinate no more. I am no preacher; let this hint suffice, The Cross once seen is death to every vice: Else He that hung there suffered all his pain, Bled, groan'd, and agonized, and died in vain. TRUTH. Pensentur trutinâ. —Hor. Man on the dubious waves of error toss'd, His ship half founder'd and his compass lost, Sees, far as human optics may command, A sleeping fog, and fancies it dry land: Spreads all his canvass, every sinew plies, Pants for it, aims at it, enters it, and dies. Then farewell all self-satisfying schemes, His well built systems, philosophic dreams, Deceitful views of future bliss, farewell! He reads his sentence at the flames of Hell. Hard lot of man! to toil for the reward Of virtue, and yet lose it!—Wherefore hard? He that would win the race, must guide his horse Obedient to the customs of the course, Else, though unequall'd to the goal he flies, A meaner than himself shall gain the prize. Grace leads the right way,—if you choose the wrong, Take it and perish, but restrain your tongue; Charge not, with light sufficient and left free, Your wilful suicide on God's decree. Oh how unlike the complex works of man, Heaven's easy, artless, unincumber'd plan! No meretricious graces to beguile, No clustering ornaments to clog the pile, From ostentation as from weakness free, It stands like the cærulean arch we see, Majestic in its own simplicity. Inscribed above the portal, from afar Conspicuous as the brightness of a star, Legible only by the light they give, Stand the soul-quickening words—believe and live. Too many, shock'd at what should charm them most, Despise the plain direction and are lost. Heaven on such terms! they cry with proud disdain, Incredible, impossible, and vain!— Rebel because 'tis easy to obey, And scorn for its own sake the gracious way. These are the sober, in whose cooler brains Some thought of immortality remains; The rest too busy or too gay, to wait On the sad theme, their everlasting state, Sport for a day and perish in a night, The foam upon the waters not so light. Who judged the Pharisee? What odious cause Exposed him to the vengeance of the laws? Had he seduced a virgin, wrong'd a friend, Or stabb'd a man to serve some private end? Was blasphemy his sin? Or did he stray From the strict duties of the sacred day? Sit long and late at the carousing board? (Such were the sins with which he charged his Lord,) No—the man's morals were exact; what then? 'Twas his ambition to be seen of men; His virtues were his pride; and that one vice Made all his virtues gewgaws of no price; He wore them as fine trappings for a show, A praying, synagogue-frequenting beau. The self-applauding bird, the peacock see,— Mark what a sumptuous Pharisee is he! Meridian sun-beams tempt him to unfold His radiant glories, azure, green, and gold; He treads as if, some solemn music near, His measured step were govern'd by his ear, And seems to say, Ye meaner fowl, give place! I am all splendour, dignity, and grace. Not so the pheasant on his charms presumes, Though he too has a glory in his plumes. He, Christian-like, retreats with modest mien, To the close copse or far sequestered green, And shines without desiring to be seen. The plea of works, as arrogant and vain, Heaven turns from with abhorrence and disdain; Not more affronted by avowed neglect, Than by the mere dissembler's feign'd respect. What is all righteousness that men devise, What, but a sordid bargain for the skies? But Christ as soon would abdicate his own, As stoop from heaven to sell the proud a throne. His dwelling a recess in some rude rock, Book, beads, and maple dish his meagre stock, In shirt of hair and weeds of canvass dress'd, Girt with a bell-rope that the Pope has bless'd, Adust with stripes told out for every crime, And sore tormented long before his time, His prayer preferr'd to saints that cannot aid, His praise postponed, and never to be paid, See the sage hermit by mankind admired, With all that bigotry adopts, inspired, Wearing out life in his religious whim, Till his religious whimsy wears out him. His works, his abstinence, his zeal allow'd, You think him humble, God accounts him proud; High in demand, though lowly in pretence, Of all his conduct this the genuine sense,— My penitential stripes, my streaming blood Have purchased heaven, and prove my title good. Turn eastward now, and fancy shall apply To your weak sight her telescopic eye. The Bramin kindles on his own bare head The sacred fire, self-torturing his trade; His voluntary pains, severe and long, Would give a barbarous air to British song; No grand inquisitor could worse invent, Than he contrives to suffer, well content. Which is the saintlier worthy of the two? Past all dispute, yon anchorite, say you. Your sentence and mine differ. What's a name? I say the Bramin has the fairer claim. If sufferings scripture no where recommends, Devised by self to answer selfish ends, Give saintship, then all Europe must agree, Ten starveling hermits suffer less than he. The truth is, (if the truth may suit your ear, And prejudice have left a passage clear,) Pride has attained its most luxuriant growth, And poisoned every virtue in them both. Pride may be pampered while the flesh grows lean, Humility may clothe an English Dean; That grace was Cowper's,—his confess'd by all— Though placed in golden Durham's second stall. Not all the plenty of a Bishop's board, His palace, and his lackeys, and, my Lord! More nourish pride, that condescending vice, Than abstinence, and beggary, and lice. It thrives in misery, and abundant grows In misery fools upon themselves impose. But why before us Protestants produce An Indian mystic or a French recluse? Their sin is plain, but what have we to fear, Reform'd and well instructed? You shall hear. Yon ancient prude, whose withered features show She might be young some forty years ago, Her elbows pinion'd close upon her hips, Her head erect, her fan upon her lips, Her eyebrows arch'd, her eyes both gone astray To watch yon amorous couple in their play, With bony and unkerchief'd neck defies The rude inclemency of wintry skies, And sails with lappet-head and mincing airs Duely at clink of bell, to morning prayers. To thrift and parsimony much inclined, She yet allows herself that boy behind; The shivering urchin, bending as he goes, With slipshod heels, and dew-drop at his nose, His predecessor's coat advanced to wear, Which future pages are yet doom'd to share; Carries her bible tuck'd beneath his arm, And hides his hands to keep his fingers warm. She, half an angel in her own account, Doubts not hereafter with the saints to mount, Though not a grace appears on strictest search, But that she fasts, and item, goes to church. Conscious of age she recollects her youth, And tells, not always with an eye to truth, Who spann'd her waist, and who, where'er he came, Scrawl'd upon glass Miss Bridget's lovely name, Who stole her slipper, fill'd it with tokay, And drank the little bumper every day. Of temper as envenom'd as an asp, Censorious, and her every word a wasp, In faithful memory she records the crimes Or real, or fictitious, of the times, Laughs at the reputations she has torn, And holds them dangling at arm's length in scorn. Such are the fruits of sanctimonious pride, Of malice fed while flesh is mortified. Take, Madam, the reward of all your prayers, Where hermits and where Bramins meet with theirs! Your portion is with them: nay, never frown, But, if you please, some fathoms lower down. Artist, attend!—your brushes and your paint— Produce them—take a chair,—now draw a Saint. Oh sorrowful and sad! the streaming tears Channel her cheeks,—a Niobe appears. Is this a Saint? Throw tints and all away! True piety is cheerful as the day, Will weep indeed and heave a pitying groan For others' woes, but smiles upon her own. What purpose has the King of Saints in view? Why falls the gospel like a gracious dew? To call up plenty from the teeming earth, Or curse the desert with a tenfold dearth? Is it that Adam's offspring may be saved From servile fear, or be the more enslaved? To loose the links that gall'd mankind before, Or bind them faster on, and add still more? The freeborn Christian has no chains to prove, Or if a chain, the golden one of love; No fear attends to quench his glowing fires, What fear he feels his gratitude inspires. Shall he for such deliverance freely wrought, Recompense ill? He trembles at the thought: His master's interest and his own combined, Prompt every movement of his heart and mind; Thought, word, and deed, his liberty evince, His freedom is the freedom of a prince. Man's obligations infinite, of course His life should prove that he perceives their force; His utmost he can render is but small, The principle and motive all in all. You have two servants,—Tom, an arch sly rogue, From top to toe the Geta now in vogue; Genteel in figure, easy in address, Moves without noise, and swift as an express, Reports a message with a pleasing grace, Expert in all the duties of his place: Say, on what hinge does his obedience move? Has he a world of gratitude and love? No, not a spark,—'tis all mere sharper's play; He likes your house, your housemaid, and your pay; Reduce his wages, or get rid of her, Tom quits you, with, your most obedient, Sir.— The dinner served, Charles takes his usual stand, Watches your eye, anticipates command, Sighs if perhaps your appetite should fail, And if he but suspects a frown, turns pale; Consults all day your interest and your ease, Richly rewarded if he can but please, And proud to make his firm attachment known, To save your life would nobly risk his own. Now, which stands highest in your serious thought? Charles, without doubt, say you,—and so he ought; One act that from a thankful heart proceeds, Excels ten thousand mercenary deeds. Thus heaven approves as honest and sincere, The work of generous love and filial fear; But with averted eyes the omniscient Judge Scorns the base hireling and the slavish drudge, Where dwell these matchless saints? old Curio cries; Even at your side, Sir, and before your eyes, The favour'd few, the enthusiasts you despise; And pleased at heart because on holy ground Sometimes a canting hypocrite is found, Reproach a people with his single fall, And cast his filthy raiment at them all. Attend,—an apt similitude shall show, Whence springs the conduct that offends you so. See where it smokes along the sounding plain, Blown all aslant, a driving dashing rain, Peal upon peal redoubling all around, Shakes it again and faster to the ground; Now flashing wide, now glancing as in play, Swift beyond thought the lightnings dart away; Ere yet it came the traveller urged his steed, And hurried, but with unsuccessful speed, Now drench'd throughout, and hopeless of his case, He drops the rein, and leaves him to his pace; Suppose, unlook'd for in a scene so rude, Long hid by interposing hill or wood, Some mansion neat and elegantly dress'd By some kind hospitable heart possess'd, Offer him warmth, security and rest; Think with what pleasure, safe and at his ease, He hears the tempest howling in the trees, What glowing thanks his lips and heart employ, While danger past is turn'd to present joy. So fares it with the sinner when he feels A growing dread of vengeance at his heels; His conscience, like a glassy lake before, Lash'd into foaming waves begins to roar; The law grown clamorous, though silent long, Arraigns him, charges him with every wrong, Asserts the rights of his offended Lord, And death or restitution is the word; The last impossible, he fears the first, And having well deserved, expects the worst. Then welcome refuge, and a peaceful home, Oh for a shelter from the wrath to come! Crush me, ye rocks, ye falling mountains, hide, Or bury me in ocean's angry tide!— The scrutiny of those all seeing eyes I dare not—And you need not, God replies; The remedy you want I freely give; The book shall teach you, read, believe and live! 'Tis done—the raging storm is heard no more, Mercy receives him on her peaceful shore, And Justice, guardian of the dread command, Drops the red vengeance from his willing hand. A soul redeem'd demands a life of praise, Hence the complexion of his future days, Hence a demeanour holy and unspeck'd, And the world's hatred, as its sure effect. Some lead a life unblameable and just, Their own dear virtue their unshaken trust. They never sin,—or if (as all offend) Some trivial slips their daily walk attend, The poor are near at hand, the charge is small, A slight gratuity atones for all. For though the Pope has lost his interest here, And pardons are not sold as once they were, No papist more desirous to compound, Than some grave sinners upon English ground: That plea refuted, other quirks they seek, Mercy is infinite and man is weak, The future shall obliterate the past, And heaven no doubt shall be their home at last. Come then,—a still, small whisper in your ear, He has no hope that never had a fear; And he that never doubted of his state, He may perhaps—perhaps he may—too late. The path to bliss abounds with many a snare, Learning is one, and wit, however rare: The Frenchman first in literary fame, (Mention him if you please,—Voltaire? the same) With spirit, genius, eloquence supplied, Lived long, wrote much, laugh'd heartily, and died: The scripture was his jest-book, whence he drew Bon mots to gall the Christian and the Jew: An infidel in health, but what when sick? Oh, then a text would touch him at the quick: View him at Paris in his last career, Surrounding throngs the demi-god revere, Exalted on his pedestal of pride, And fumed with frankincense on every side, He begs their flattery with his latest breath, And smothered in't at last, is praised to death. Yon cottager who weaves at her own door, Pillow and bobbins all her little store, Content though mean, and cheerful, if not gay, Shuffling her threads about the live-long day, Just earns a scanty pittance, and at night Lies down secure, her heart and pocket light; She for her humble sphere by nature fit, Has little understanding, and no wit, Receives no praise, but (though her lot be such, Toilsome and indigent) she renders much; Just knows, and knows no more, her bible true, A truth the brilliant Frenchman never knew, And in that charter reads, with sparkling eyes, Her title to a treasure in the skies. O happy peasant! O unhappy bard! His the mere tinsel, hers the rich reward; He praised perhaps for ages yet to come, She never heard of half a mile from home; He lost in errors his vain heart prefers, She safe in the simplicity of hers. Not many wise, rich, noble, or profound In science, win one inch of heavenly ground: And is it not a mortifying thought The poor should gain it, and the rich should not? No;—the voluptuaries, who ne'er forget One pleasure lost, lose heaven without regret; Regret would rouse them and give birth to prayer, Prayer would add faith, and faith would fix them there. Not that the Former of us all in this, Or aught he does, is govern'd by caprice; The supposition is replete with sin, And bears the brand of blasphemy burnt in. Not so;—the silver trumpet's heavenly call, Sounds for the poor, but sounds alike for all; Kings are invited, and would kings obey, No slaves on earth more welcome were than they: But royalty, nobility, and state, Are such a dead preponderating weight, That endless bliss (how strange soe'er it seem) In counterpoise, flies up and kicks the beam. 'Tis open and ye cannot enter;—why? Because ye will not, Conyers would reply;— And he says much that many may dispute And cavil at with ease, but none refute. Oh bless'd effect of penury and want, The seed sown there, how vigorous is the plant! No soil like poverty for growth divine, As leanest land supplies the richest wine. Earth gives too little, giving only bread, To nourish pride or turn the weakest head: To them, the sounding jargon of the schools, Seems what it is, a cap and bells for fools: The light they walk by, kindled from above, Shows them the shortest way to life and love: They, strangers to the controversial field, Where deists always foil'd, yet scorn to yield, And never check'd by what impedes the wise, Believe, rush forward, and possess the prize. Envy, ye great, the dull unletter'd small, Ye have much cause for envy—but not all; We boast some rich ones whom the gospel sways, And one that wears a coronet and prays; Like gleanings of an olive tree they show, Here and there one upon the topmost bough. How readily upon the gospel plan, That question has its answer,—what is man? Sinful and weak, in every sense a wretch, An instrument whose chords upon the stretch And strain'd to the last screw that he can bear, Yield only discord in his Maker's ear: Once the blest residence of truth divine, Glorious as Solyma's interior shrine, Where, in his own oracular abode, Dwelt visibly the light-creating God; But made long since, like Babylon of old, A den of mischiefs never to be told: And she once mistress of the realms around, Now scattered wide and no where to be found, As soon shall rise and reascend the throne, By native power and energy her own, As Nature at her own peculiar cost, Restore to man the glories he has lost. Go bid the winter cease to chill the year, Replace the wandering comet in his sphere, Then boast (but wait for that unhoped for hour) The self-restoring arm of human power! But what is man in his own proud esteem? Hear him, himself the poet and the theme: A monarch clothed with majesty and awe, His mind his kingdom, and his will his law, Grace in his mien and glory in his eyes, Supreme on Earth and worthy of the skies, Strength in his heart, dominion in his nod, And, thunderbolts excepted, quite a God! So sings he, charm'd with his own mind and form, The song magnificent, the theme a worm! Himself so much the source of his delight, His Maker has no beauty in his sight. See where he sits contemplative and fixt, Pleasure and wonder in his features mixt: His passions tamed and all at his control, How perfect the composure of his soul! Complacency has breathed a gentle gale O'er all his thoughts, and swell'd his easy sail. His books well trimm'd and in the gayest style, Like regimented coxcombs rank and file, Adorn his intellects as well as shelves, And teach him notions splendid as themselves: The Bible only stands neglected there, Though that of all most worthy of his care; And, like an infant, troublesome awake, Is left to sleep for peace and quiet sake. What shall the man deserve of humankind, Whose happy skill and industry combined Shall prove (what argument could never yet) The Bible an imposture and a cheat? The praises of the libertine profess'd, The worst of men, and curses of the best. Where should the living, weeping o'er his woes, The dying, trembling at the awful close, Where the betray'd, forsaken, and oppress'd, The thousands whom the world forbids to rest, Where should they find (those comforts at an end The Scripture yields,) or hope to find, a friend? Sorrow might muse herself to madness then, And, seeking exile from the sight of men, Bury herself in solitude profound, Grow frantic with her pangs, and bite the ground. Thus often Unbelief, grown sick of life, Flies to the tempting pool, or felon knife; The jury meet, the coroner is short, And lunacy the verdict of the court; Reverse the sentence, let the truth be known, Such lunacy is ignorance alone: They knew not, what some bishops may not know, That Scripture is the only cure of woe: That field of promise, how it flings abroad Its odour o'er the Christian's thorny road! The soul, reposing on assured relief, Feels herself happy amidst all her grief, Forgets her labour as she toils along, Weeps tears of joy, and bursts into a song. But the same word that, like the polish'd share, Ploughs up the roots of a believer's care, Kills too the flowery weeds, where'er they grow, That bind the sinner's Bacchanalian brow. Oh that unwelcome voice of heavenly love, Sad messenger of mercy from above, How does it grate upon his thankless ear, Crippling his pleasures with the cramp of fear! His will and judgement at continual strife, That civil war imbitters all his life: In vain he points his powers against the skies, In vain he closes or averts his eyes, Truth will intrude—she bids him yet beware,— And shakes the sceptic in the scorner's chair. Though various foes against the truth combine, Pride above all opposes her design; Pride, of a growth superior to the rest, The subtlest serpent with the loftiest crest, Swells at the thought, and kindling into rage, Would hiss the cherub Mercy from the stage. And is the soul indeed so lost,—she cries, Fallen from her glory and too weak to rise, Torpid and dull beneath a frozen zone, Has she no spark that may be deem'd her own? Grant her indebted to what zealots call Grace undeserved, yet surely not for all;— Some beams of rectitude she yet displays, Some love of virtue and some power to praise; Can lift herself above corporeal things, And soaring on her own unborrow'd wings, Possess herself of all that's good or true, Assert the skies, and vindicate her due. Past indiscretion is a venial crime, And if the youth, unmellow'd yet by time, Bore on his branch luxuriant then and rude, Fruits of a blighted size, austere and crude, Maturer years shall happier stores produce, And meliorate the well concocted juice. Then, conscious of her meritorious zeal, To Justice she may make her bold appeal, And leave to Mercy, with a tranquil mind, The worthless and unfruitful of mankind. Hear then how Mercy, slighted and defied, Retorts the affront against the crown of Pride. Perish the virtue, as it ought, abhorr'd, And the fool with it that insults his Lord. The atonement a Redeemer's love has wrought Is not for you,—the righteous need it not. Seest thou yon harlot wooing all she meets, The worn-out nuisance of the public streets, Herself from morn to night, from night to morn, Her own abhorrence, and as much your scorn, The gracious shower, unlimited and free, Shall fall on her, when Heaven denies it thee. Of all that wisdom dictates, this the drift, That man is dead in sin, and life a gift. Is virtue then, unless of Christian growth, Mere fallacy, or foolishness, or both? Ten thousand sages lost in endless woe, For ignorance of what they could not know? That speech betrays at once a bigot's tongue; Charge not a God with such outrageous wrong! Truly not I.—The partial light men have, My creed persuades me, well employ'd may save; While he that scorns the noonday beam, perverse, Shall find the blessing unimproved a curse. Let heathen worthies, whose exalted mind Left sensuality and dross behind, Possess for me their undisputed lot, And take unenvied the reward they sought. But still in virtue of a Saviour's plea, Not blind by choice, but destined not to see. Their fortitude and wisdom were a flame Celestial, though they knew not whence it came, Derived from the same source of light and grace, That guides the Christian in his swifter race; Their judge was Conscience, and her rule their law; That rule, pursued with reverence and with awe, Led them, however faltering, faint, and slow, From what they knew, to what they wish'd to know. But let not him that shares a brighter day, Traduce the splendour of a noontide ray, Prefer the twilight of a darker time, And deem his base stupidity no crime; The wretch, that slights the bounty of the skies, And sinks while favour'd with the means to rise, Shall find them rated at their full amount, The good he scorn'd all carried to account. Marshalling all his terrors as he came, Thunder and earthquake and devouring flame, From Sinai's top Jehovah gave the law, Life for obedience, death for every flaw. When the great Sovereign would his will express, He gives a perfect rule; what can He less? And guards it with a sanction as severe As vengeance can inflict, or sinners fear: Else his own glorious rights he would disclaim, And man might safely trifle with his name. He bids him glow with unremitting love To all on earth, and to Himself above; Condemns the injurious deed, the slanderous tongue, The thought that meditates a brother's wrong; Brings not alone the more conspicuous part, His conduct to the test, but tries his heart. Hark! universal Nature shook and groan'd; 'Twas the last trumpet—see the Judge enthroned! Rouse all your courage at your utmost need, Now summon every virtue, stand and plead. What! silent? Is your boasting heard no more? That self-renouncing wisdom, learn'd before, Had shed immortal glories on your brow, That all your virtues cannot purchase now. All joy to the believer! he can speak, Trembling yet happy, confident yet meek. Since the dear hour, that brought me to thy foot, And cut up all my follies by the root, I never trusted in an arm but thine, Nor hoped but in thy righteousness divine: My prayers and alms, imperfect and defiled, Were but the feeble efforts of a child; Howe'er perform'd, it was their brightest part, That they proceeded from a grateful heart; Cleansed in thine own all-purifying blood, Forgive their evil, and accept their good; I cast them at thy feet—my only plea Is what it was, dependance upon Thee; While struggling in the vale of tears below, That never fail'd, nor shall it fail me now. Angelic gratulations rend the skies, Pride falls unpitied, never more to rise, Humility is crown'd, and Faith receives the prize. EXPOSTULATION. Tantane, tam patiens, nullo certamine tolli Dona sines? Virgil. Why weeps the Muse for England? What appears In England's case to move the Muse to tears? From side to side of her delightful isle Is she not clothed with a perpetual smile? Can Nature add a charm, or art confer A new-found luxury not seen in her? Where under heaven is pleasure more pursued, Or where does cold reflection less intrude? Her fields a rich expanse of wavy corn Pour'd out from Plenty's overflowing horn; Ambrosial gardens in which Art supplies The fervour and the force of Indian skies; Her peaceful shores, where busy Commerce waits To pour his golden tide through all her gates; Whom fiery suns that scorch the russet spice Of eastern groves, and oceans floor'd with ice, Forbid in vain to push his daring way To darker climes, or climes of brighter day; Whom the winds waft where'er the billows roll, From the world's girdle to the frozen pole; The chariots bounding in her wheel-worn streets; Her vaults below where every vintage meets; Her theatres, her revels, and her sports, The scenes to which not youth alone resorts, But age, in spite of weakness and of pain, Still haunts, in hope to dream of youth again; All speak her happy:—let the Muse look round From East to West, no sorrow can be found, Or only what in cottages confined, Sighs unregarded to the passing wind. Then wherefore weep for England? What appears In England's case to move the Muse to tears? The prophet wept for Israel, wish'd his eyes Were fountains fed with infinite supplies; For Israel dealt in robbery and wrong, There were the scorner's and the slanderer's tongue, Oaths used as playthings or convenient tools, As interest bias'd knaves, or fashion fools; Adultery neighing at his neighbour's door, Oppression labouring hard to grind the poor, The partial balance and deceitful weight, The treacherous smile, a mask for secret hate, Hypocrisy, formality in prayer, And the dull service of the lip were there. Her women insolent and self-caress'd, By Vanity's unwearied finger dress'd, Forgot the blush that virgin fears impart To modest cheeks, and borrow'd one from art; Were just such trifles without worth or use, As silly pride and idleness produce; Curl'd, scented, furbelow'd, and flounced around, With feet too delicate to touch the ground, They stretch'd the neck, and roll'd the wanton eye, And sigh'd for every fool that flutter'd by. He saw his people slaves to every lust, Lewd, avaricious, arrogant, unjust; He heard the wheels of an avenging God Groan heavily along the distant road; Saw Babylon set wide her two-leaved brass To let the military deluge pass; Jerusalem a prey, her glory soil'd, Her princes captive, and her treasures spoil'd; Wept till all Israel heard his bitter cry, Stamp'd with his foot, and smote upon his thigh; But wept and stamp'd and smote his thigh in vain, Pleasure is deaf when told of future pain, And sounds prophetic are too rough to suit Ears long accustom'd to the pleasing lute; They scorn'd his inspiration and his theme, Pronounced him frantic and his fears a dream, With self-indulgence wing'd the fleeting hours, Till the foe found them, and down fell the towers. Long time Assyria bound them in her chain, Till penitence had purged the public stain, And Cyrus, with relenting pity moved, Return'd them happy to the land they loved: There, proof against prosperity, awhile They stood the test of her ensnaring smile, And had the grace in scenes of peace to show The virtue they had learn'd in scenes of woe. But man is frail, and can but ill sustain A long immunity from grief and pain, And after all the joys that plenty leads, With tiptoe step vice silently succeeds. When he that ruled them with a shepherd's rod, In form a man, in dignity a God, Came not expected in that humble guise, To sift, and search them with unerring eyes, He found, conceal'd beneath a fair outside, The filth of rottenness and worm of pride, Their piety a system of deceit, Scripture employ'd to sanctify the cheat, The pharisee the dupe of his own art, Self-idolized, and yet a knave at heart. When nations are to perish in their sins, 'Tis in the church the leprosy begins: The priest whose office is, with zeal sincere, To watch the fountain, and preserve it clear, Carelessly nods and sleeps upon the brink, While others poison what the flock must drink; Or, waking at the call of lust alone, Infuses lies and errors of his own: His unsuspecting sheep believe it pure, And, tainted by the very means of cure, Catch from each other a contagious spot, The foul forerunner of a general rot. Then Truth is hush'd, that Heresy may preach; And all is trash that Reason cannot reach; Then God's own image on the soul impress'd Becomes a mockery and a standing jest; And faith, the root whence only can arise The graces of a life that wins the skies, Loses at once all value and esteem, Pronounced by greybeards a pernicious dream; Then ceremony leads her bigots forth, Prepared to fight for shadows of no worth, While truths, on which eternal things depend, Find not, or hardly find, a single friend; As soldiers watch the signal of command, They learn to bow, to kneel, to sit, to stand; Happy to fill religion's vacant place With hollow form, and gesture, and grimace. Such, when the Teacher of his church was there, People and priest, the sons of Israel were, Stiff in the letter, lax in the design And import of their oracles divine, Their learning legendary, false, absurd, And yet exalted above God's own word, They drew a curse from an intended good, Puff'd up with gifts they never understood. He judged them with as terrible a frown, As if not love, but wrath had brought him down; Yet he was gentle as soft summer airs, Had grace for others' sins, but none for theirs. Through all he spoke a noble plainness ran; Rhetoric is artifice, the work of man, And tricks and turns that fancy may devise, Are far too mean for Him that rules the skies. The astonish'd vulgar trembled while he tore The mask from faces never seen before; He stripp'd the impostors in the noonday sun, Show'd that they follow'd all they seem'd to shun, Their prayers made public, their excesses kept As private as the chambers where they slept; The temple and its holy rites profaned By mummeries he that dwelt in it disdain'd; Uplifted hands, that, at convenient times, Could act extortion and the worst of crimes, Wash'd with a neatness scrupulously nice, And free from every taint but that of vice. Judgement, however tardy, mends her pace When Obstinacy once has conquer'd Grace. They saw distemper heal'd, and life restored, In answer to the fiat of his word, Confess'd the wonder, and with daring tongue Blasphemed the authority from which it sprung. They knew by sure prognostics seen on high, The future tone and temper of the sky, But, grave dissemblers! could not understand, That sin let loose speaks punishment at hand. Ask now of history's authentic page, And call up evidence from every age; Display with busy and laborious hand The blessings of the most indebted land; What nation will you find whose annals prove So rich an interest in almighty love? Where dwell they now, where dwelt in ancient day, A people planted, water'd, blest as they? Let Egypt's plagues and Canaan's woes proclaim The favours pour'd upon the Jewish name; Their freedom purchased for them at the cost Of all their hard oppressors valued most, Their title to a country not their own Made sure by prodigies till then unknown; For them the state they left made waste and void, For them the states to which they went destroy'd, A cloud to measure out their march by day, By night a fire to cheer the gloomy way, That moving signal summoning, when best, Their host to move, and, when it stay'd, to rest. For them the rocks dissolved into a flood, The dews condensed into angelic food, Their very garments sacred, old yet new, And Time forbid to touch them as he flew; Streams, swell'd above the bank, enjoin'd to stand, While they pass'd through to their appointed land; Their leader arm'd with meekness zeal and love, And graced with clear credentials from above; Themselves secured beneath the Almighty wing; Their God their captain Vide Joshua, v. 14., lawgiver, and king; Crown'd with a thousand victories, and at last Lords of the conquer'd soil, there rooted fast, In peace possessing what they won by war, Their name far publish'd, and revered as far; Where will you find a race like theirs, endow'd With all that man e'er wish'd, or Heaven bestow'd? They and they only amongst all mankind Received the transcript of the eternal mind, Were trusted with his own engraven laws, And constituted guardians of his cause; Theirs were the prophets, theirs the priestly call, And theirs by birth the Saviour of us all. In vain the nations that had seen them rise With fierce and envious yet admiring eyes, Had sought to crush them, guarded as they were By power divine and skill that could not err. Had they maintain'd allegiance firm and sure, And kept the faith immaculate and pure, Then the proud eagles of all-conquering Rome Had found one city not to be o'ercome, And the twelve standards of the tribes unfurl'd Had bid defiance to the warring world. But grace abused brings forth the foulest deeds, As richest soil the most luxuriant weeds; Cured of the golden calves, their fathers' sin, They set up self, that idol-god, within; View'd a Deliverer with disdain and hate, Who left them still a tributary state; Seized fast his hand, held out to set them free From a worse yoke, and nail'd it to the tree. There was the consummation and the crown, The flower of Israel's infamy full blown; Thence date their sad declension and their fall, Their woes not yet repeal'd, thence date them all. Thus fell the best instructed in her day, And the most favour'd land, look where we may. Philosophy indeed on Grecian eyes Had pour'd the day, and clear'd the Roman skies; In other climes perhaps creative art, With power surpassing theirs, perform'd her part, Might give more life to marble, or might fill The glowing tablets with a juster skill, Might shine in fable, and grace idle themes With all the embroidery of poetic dreams; 'Twas theirs alone to dive into the plan, That truth and mercy had reveal'd to man; And while the world beside, that plan unknown, Deified useless wood or senseless stone, They breathed in faith their well-directed prayers, And the true God, the God of truth, was theirs. Their glory faded, and their race dispersed, The last of nations now, though once the first, They warn and teach the proudest, would they learn, Keep wisdom, or meet vengeance in your turn! If we escaped not, if Heaven spared not us, Peel'd, scatter'd, and exterminated thus; If Vice received her retribution due, When we were visited, what hope for you? When God arises with an aweful frown, To punish lust, or pluck presumption down; When gifts perverted, or not duly prized, Pleasure o'ervalued, and his grace despised, Provoke the vengeance of his righteous hand To pour down wrath upon a thankless land, He will be found impartially severe, Too just to wink, or speak the guilty clear. O Israel, of all nations most undone! Thy diadem displaced, thy sceptre gone, Thy temple, once thy glory, fallen and rased, And thou a worshipper e'en where thou mayst; Thy services once only without spot, Mere shadows now, their ancient pomp forgot; Thy Levites, once a consecrated host, No longer Levites, and their lineage lost, And thou thyself o'er every country sown, With none on earth that thou canst call thine own; Cry aloud, thou that sittest in the dust, Cry to the proud, the cruel, and unjust, Knock at the gates of nations, rouse their fears, Say wrath is coming, and the storm appears; But raise the shrillest cry in British ears. What ails thee, restless as the waves that roar, And fling their foam against thy chalky shore? Mistress, at least while Providence shall please, And trident-bearing queen of the wide seas,— Why, having kept good faith, and often shown Friendship and truth to others, find'st thou none? Thou that hast set the persecuted free, None interposes now to succour thee. Countries indebted to thy power, that shine With light derived from thee, would smother thine; Thy very children watch for thy disgrace,— A lawless brood, and curse thee to thy face: Thy rulers load thy credit, year by year, With sums Peruvian mines could never clear, As if, like arches built with skilful hand, The more 'twere press'd the firmer it would stand. The cry in all thy ships is still the same, Speed us away to battle and to fame! Thy mariners explore the wild expanse, Impatient to descry the flags of France, But, though they fight as thine have ever fought, Return ashamed without the wreaths they sought. Thy senate is a scene of civil jar, Chaos of contrarieties at war, Where sharp and solid, phlegmatic and light, Discordant atoms meet, ferment, and fight; Where Obstinacy takes his sturdy stand, To disconcert what Policy has plann'd; Where Policy is busied all night long In setting right what Faction has set wrong; Where flails of oratory thresh the floor, That yields them chaff and dust, and nothing more. Thy rack'd inhabitants repine, complain, Tax'd till the brow of Labour sweats in vain; War lays a burden on the reeling state, And Peace does nothing to relieve the weight; Successive loads succeeding broils impose, And sighing millions prophesy the close. Is adverse Providence when ponder'd well, So dimly writ or difficult to spell, Thou canst not read with readiness and ease Providence adverse in events like these? Know then, that heavenly wisdom on this ball Creates, gives birth to, guides, consummates all: That, while laborious and quick-thoughted man Snuffs up the praise of what he seems to plan, He first conceives, then perfects his design, As a mere instrument in hands divine: Blind to the working of that secret power That balances the wings of every hour, The busy trifler dreams himself alone, Frames many a purpose, and God works his own. States thrive or wither as moons wax and wane, Even as his will and his decrees ordain; While honour, virtue, piety bear sway, They flourish; and as these decline, decay. In just resentment of his injured laws, He pours contempt on them and on their cause; Strikes the rough thread of error right athwart The web of every scheme they have at heart, Bids rottenness invade and bring to dust The pillars of support in which they trust, And do his errand of disgrace and shame On the chief strength and glory of the frame. None ever yet impeded what He wrought, None bars Him out from his most secret thought; Darkness itself before His eyes is light, And Hell's close mischief naked in His sight. Stand now and judge thyself.—Hast thou incurr'd His anger who can waste thee with a word, Who poises and proportions sea and land, Weighing them in the hollow of his hand, And in whose aweful sight all nations seem As grasshoppers, as dust, a drop, a dream, Hast thou (a sacrilege his soul abhors) Claim'd all the glory of thy prosperous wars, Proud of thy fleets and armies, stolen the gem Of his just praise, to lavish it on them? Hast thou not learn'd, what thou art often told, A truth still sacred, and believed of old, That no success attends on spears and swords Unbless'd, and that the battle is the Lord's? That Courage is his creature, and Dismay The post that at his bidding speeds away, Ghastly in feature, and his stammering tongue With doleful rumour and sad presage hung, To quell the valour of the stoutest heart, And teach the combatant a woman's part? That he bids thousands fly when none pursue, Saves as he will by many or by few, And claims for ever as his royal right, The event and sure decision of the fight? Hast thou, though suckled at fair Freedom's breast, Exported slavery to the conquer'd East, Pull'd down the tyrants India served with dread, And raised thyself, a greater, in their stead? Gone thither arm'd and hungry, return'd full, Fed from the richest veins of the Mogul, A despot big with power obtain'd by wealth, And that obtain'd by rapine and by stealth? With Asiatic vices stored thy mind, But left their virtues and thine own behind, And, having truck'd thy soul, brought home the fee, To tempt the poor to sell himself to thee? Hast thou by statute shoved from its design The Saviour's feast, his own blest bread and wine, And made the symbols of atoning grace An office key, a picklock to a place, That infidels may prove their title good By an oath dipp'd in sacramental blood? A blot that will be still a blot, in spite Of all that grave apologists may write, And though a Bishop toil to cleanse the stain, He wipes and scours the silver cup in vain. And hast thou sworn on every slight pretence, Till perjuries are common as bad pence, While thousands, careless of the damning sin, Kiss the book's outside, who ne'er look within? Hast thou, when Heaven has clothed thee with disgrace, And, long provoked, repaid thee to thy face, (For thou hast known eclipses, and endured Dimness and anguish, all thy beams obscured, When sin has shed dishonour on thy brow, And never of a sabler hue than now;) Hast thou with heart perverse and conscience sear'd, Despising all rebuke, still persevered, And, having chosen evil, scorn'd the voice That cried, Repent! and gloried in thy choice? Thy fastings, when calamity at last Suggests the expedient of a yearly fast, What mean they? Canst thou dream there is a power In lighter diet at a later hour, To charm to sleep the threatenings of the skies, And hide past folly from all-seeing eyes? The fast that wins deliverance, and suspends The stroke that a vindictive God intends, Is to renounce hypocrisy; to draw Thy life upon the pattern of the law; To war with pleasures, idolized before; To vanquish lust, and wear its yoke no more. All fasting else, whate'er be the pretence, Is wooing mercy by renew'd offence. Hast thou within thee sins, that in old time Brought fire from Heaven, the sex-abusing crime, Whose horrid perpetration stamps disgrace Baboons are free from, upon human race? Think on the fruitful and well-water'd spot That fed the flocks and herds of wealthy Lot, Where Paradise seem'd still vouchsafed on earth, Burning and scorch'd into perpetual dearth, Or, in his words who damn'd the base desire, Suffering the vengeance of eternal fire; Then Nature injured, scandalized, defiled, Unveil'd her blushing cheek, look'd on, and smiled; Beheld with joy the lovely scene defaced, And praised the wrath that laid her beauties waste. Far be the thought from any verse of mine, And farther still the form'd and fix'd design, To thrust the charge of deeds that I detest, Against an innocent unconscious breast: The man that dares traduce, because he can With safety to himself, is not a man. An individual is a sacred mark, Not to be pierced in play or in the dark; But public censure speaks a public foe, Unless a zeal for virtue guide the blow. The priestly brotherhood, devout, sincere, From mean self-interest and ambition clear, Their hope in Heaven, servility their scorn, Prompt to persuade, expostulate, and warn, Their wisdom pure and given them from above, Their usefulness ensured by zeal and love, As meek as the man Moses, and withal As bold as, in Agrippa's presence, Paul, Should fly the world's contaminating touch, Holy and unpolluted:—are thine such? Except a few with Eli's spirit blest, Hophni and Phineas may describe the rest. Where shall a teacher look in days like these, For ears and hearts that he can hope to please? Look to the poor,—the simple and the plain Will hear perhaps thy salutary strain: Humility is gentle, apt to learn, Speak but the word, will listen and return. Alas, not so! the poorest of the flock Are proud, and set their faces as a rock; Denied that earthly opulence they chuse, God's better gift they scoff at and refuse. The rich, the produce of a nobler stem, Are more intelligent at least,—try them. O vain inquiry! they without remorse Are altogether gone a devious course, Where beckoning Pleasure leads them, wildly stray; Have burst the bands, and cast the yoke away. Now, borne upon the wings of truth sublime, Review thy dim original and prime. This island-spot of unreclaim'd rude earth, The cradle that received thee at thy birth, Was rock'd by many a rough Norwegian blast, And Danish howlings scared thee as they pass'd; For thou wast born amid the din of arms, And suck'd a breast that panted with alarms. While yet thou wast a groveling puling chit, Thy bones not fashion'd, and thy joints not knit, The Roman taught thy stubborn knee to bow, Though twice a Cæsar could not bend thee now: His victory was that of orient light, When the sun's shafts disperse the gloom of night. Thy language at this distant moment shows How much the country to the conqueror owes: Expressive, energetic, and refined, It sparkles with the gems he left behind. He brought thy land a blessing when he came, He found thee savage, and he left thee tame; Taught thee to clothe thy pink'd and painted hide, And grace thy figure with a soldier's pride; He sow'd the seeds of order where he went, Improved thee far beyond his own intent, And while he ruled thee by the sword alone, Made thee at last a warrior like his own. Religion, if in heavenly truths attired, Needs only to be seen to be admired; But thine, as dark as witcheries of the night, Was form'd to harden hearts and shock the sight; Thy Druids struck the well-strung harps they bore With fingers deeply dyed in human gore; And, while the victim slowly bled to death, Upon the tolling chords rung out his dying breath. Who brought the lamp that with awakening beams Dispell'd thy gloom, and broke away thy dreams, Tradition, now decrepid and worn out, Babbler of ancient fables, leaves a doubt: But still light reach'd thee; and those gods of thine, Woden and Thor, each tottering in his shrine, Fell broken and defaced at his own door, As Dagon in Philistia long before. But Rome with sorceries and magic wand Soon raised a cloud that darken'd every land; And thine was smother'd in the stench and fog Of Tiber's marshes and the papal bog. Then priests with bulls and briefs and shaven crowns, And griping fists and unrelenting frowns, Legates and delegates with powers from hell, Though heavenly in pretension, fleeced thee well; And to this hour, to keep it fresh in mind, Some twigs of that old scourge are left behind Which may be found at Doctors Commons. C.. Thy soldiery, the Pope's well managed pack, Were train'd beneath his lash, and knew the smack, And, when he laid them on the scent of blood, Would hunt a Saracen through fire and flood. Lavish of life to win an empty tomb, That proved a mint of wealth, a mine to Rome, They left their bones beneath unfriendly skies, His worthless absolution all the prize. Thou wast the veriest slave in days of yore, That ever dragg'd a chain, or tugg'd an oar; Thy monarchs arbitrary, fierce, unjust, Themselves the slaves of bigotry or lust, Disdain'd thy counsels, only in distress Found thee a goodly spunge for Power to press. Thy chiefs, the lords of many a petty fee, Provoked and harass'd, in return plagued thee; Call'd thee away from peaceable employ Domestic happiness and rural joy, To waste thy life in arms, or lay it down In causeless feuds and bickerings of their own. Thy parliaments adored on bended knees The sovereignty they were convened to please; Whate'er was ask'd, too timid to resist, Complied with, and were graciously dismiss'd; And if some Spartan soul a doubt express'd, And, blushing at the tameness of the rest, Dared to suppose the subject had a choice, He was a traitor by the general voice. O slave! with powers thou didst not dare exert, Verse cannot stoop so low as thy desert! It shakes the sides of splenetic Disdain, Thou self-entitled ruler of the main, To trace thee to the date when yon fair sea, That clips thy shores, had no such charms for thee; When other nations flew from coast to coast, And thou hadst neither fleet nor flag to boast. Kneel now, and lay thy forehead in the dust! Blush if thou canst; not petrified, thou must; Act but an honest and a faithful part; Compare what then thou wast with what thou art; And God's disposing providence confess'd, Obduracy itself must yield the rest.— Then thou art bound to serve him, and to prove, Hour after hour, thy gratitude and love. Has he not hid thee and thy favour'd land, For ages safe beneath his sheltering hand, Given thee his blessing on the clearest proof, Bid nations leagued against thee stand aloof, And charged Hostility and Hate to roar Where else they would, but not upon thy shore? His power secured thee, when presumptuous Spain Baptized her fleet Invincible in vain; Her gloomy monarch, doubtful and resign'd To every pang that racks an anxious mind, Ask'd of the waves that broke upon his coast, What tidings? and the surge replied—All lost! And when the Stuart leaning on the Scot, Then too much feared, and now too much forgot, Pierced to the very centre of thy realm, And hoped to seize his abdicated helm, 'Twas but to prove how quickly with a frown He that had raised thee could have pluck'd thee down. Peculiar is the grace by thee possess'd, Thy foes implacable, thy land at rest; Thy thunders travel over earth and seas, And all at home is pleasure, wealth, and ease. 'Tis thus, extending his tempestuous arm, Thy Maker fills the nations with alarm, While his own Heaven surveys the troubled scene, And feels no change, unshaken and serene. Freedom, in other lands scarce known to shine, Pours out a flood of splendour upon thine; Thou hast as bright an interest in her rays As ever Roman had in Rome's best days. True freedom is, where no restraint is known That scripture, justice, and good sense disown, Where only vice and injury are tied, And all from shore to shore is free beside. Such freedom is,—and Windsor's hoary towers Stood trembling at the boldness of thy powers, That won a nymph on that immortal plain, Like her the fabled Phœbus woo'd in vain: He found the laurel only;—happier you, The unfading laurel and the virgin too Alluding to the grant of Magna Charta, which was extorted from King John by the barons, at Runnymede, near Windsor. C.! Now think, if Pleasure have a thought to spare, If God himself be not beneath her care; If business, constant as the wheels of time, Can pause one hour to read a serious rhyme; If the new mail thy merchants now receive, Or expectation of the next give leave: O, think, if chargeable with deep arrears For such indulgence gilding all thy years, How much, though long neglected, shining yet, The beams of heavenly truth have swell'd the debt. When persecuting zeal made royal sport With tortured innocence in Mary's court, And Bonner, blithe as shepherd at a wake, Enjoy'd the show and danced about the stake; The sacred book, its value understood, Received the seal of martyrdom in blood. Those holy men, so full of truth and grace, Seem to reflection of a different race, Meek, modest, venerable, wise, sincere, In such a cause they could not dare to fear; They could not purchase earth with such a prize, Nor spare a life too short to reach the skies. From them to thee, convey'd along the tide Their streaming hearts pour'd freely when they died, Those truths which neither use nor years impair, Invite thee, woo thee, to the bliss they share. What dotage will not Vanity maintain? What web too weak to catch a modern brain? The moles and bats in full assembly find, On special search, the keen-eyed eagle blind. And did they dream, and art thou wiser now? Prove it:—if better, I submit and bow. Wisdom and Goodness are twin born, one heart Must hold both sisters, never seen apart. So then,—as darkness overspread the deep, Ere Nature rose from her eternal sleep, And this delightful earth, and that fair sky, Leap'd out of nothing, call'd by the Most High, By such a change thy darkness is made light, Thy chaos order, and thy weakness might; And He, whose power mere nullity obeys, Who found thee nothing, form'd thee for his praise. To praise him is to serve him, and fulfil, Doing and suffering, his unquestion'd will; 'Tis to believe what men inspired of old, Faithful, and faithfully inform'd, unfold; Candid and just, with no false aim in view, To take for truth what cannot but be true, To learn in God's own school the Christian part, And bind the task assign'd thee to thine heart. Happy the man there seeking and there found, Happy the nation where such men abound. How shall a verse impress thee? by what name Shall I adjure thee not to court thy shame? By theirs, whose bright example unimpeach'd Directs thee to that eminence they reach'd, Heroes and worthies of days past, thy sires? Or His, who touch'd their heart with hallow'd fires? Their names, alas! in vain reproach an age, Whom all the vanities they scorn'd engage; And His, that seraphs trembled at, is hung Disgracefully on every trifler's tongue, Or serves the champion in forensic war To flourish and parade with at the bar. Pleasure herself perhaps suggests a plea, If interest move thee, to persuade even thee; By every charm that smiles upon her face, By joys possess'd, and joys still held in chace, If dear society be worth a thought, And if the feast of freedom cloy thee not, Reflect that these and all that seems thine own, Held by the tenure of his will alone, Like angels in the service of their Lord, Remain with thee, or leave thee at his word; That gratitude and temperance in our use Of what he gives unsparing and profuse, Secure the favour, and enhance the joy, That thankless waste and wild abuse destroy. But above all reflect, how cheap soe'er Those rights that millions envy thee, appear, And though resolved to risk them, and swim down The tide of pleasure heedless of His frown, That blessings truly sacred, and when given, Mark'd with the signature and stamp of Heaven, The word of prophecy, those truths divine Which make that Heaven, if thou desire it, thine, (Aweful alternative! believed, beloved, Thy glory; and thy shame if unimproved,) Are never long vouchsafed, if push'd aside With cold disgust or philosophic pride; And that judicially withdrawn, disgrace, Error and darkness occupy their place. A world is up in arms, and thou a spot Not quickly found if negligently sought, Thy soul as ample as thy bounds are small, Endurest the brunt, and darest defy them all: And wilt thou join to this bold enterprize A bolder still, a contest with the skies? Remember, if He guard thee and secure, Whoe'er assails thee, thy success is sure; But if He leave thee, though the skill and power Of nations, sworn to spoil thee and devour, Were all collected in thy single arm, And thou couldst laugh away the fear of harm, That strength would fail opposed against the push And feeble onset of a pigmy rush. Say not (and if the thought of such defence Should spring within thy bosom, drive it thence,) What nation amongst all my foes is free From crimes as base as any charged on me? Their measure fill'd, they too shall pay the debt, Which God, though long forborn, will not forget. But know that Wrath divine, when most severe, Makes justice still the guide of his career, And will not punish in one mingled crowd, Them without light, and thee without a cloud. Muse, hang this harp upon yon aged beech, Still murmuring with the solemn truths I teach, And while at intervals a cold blast sings Through the dry leaves, and pants upon the strings, My soul shall sigh in secret, and lament A nation scourged, yet tardy to repent. I know the warning song is sung in vain, That few will hear and fewer heed the strain; But if a sweeter voice, and one design'd A blessing to my country and mankind, Reclaim the wandering thousands, and bring home A flock so scattered and so wont to roam, Then place it once again between my knees; The sound of truth will then be sure to please: And truth alone, where'er my life be cast, In scenes of plenty or the pining waste, Shall be my chosen theme, my glory to the last. HOPE. ? doceas iter, et sacra ostia pandas. Virg. En. 6. Ask what is human life—the sage replies, With disappointment lowering in his eyes, A painful passage o'er a restless flood, A vain pursuit of fugitive false good, A scene of fancied bliss and heartfelt care, Closing at last in darkness and despair. The poor, inured to drudgery and distress, Act without aim, think little, and feel less, And no where, but in feign'd Arcadian scenes, Taste happiness, or know what pleasure means. Riches are pass'd away from hand to hand, As fortune, vice, or folly may command; As in a dance the pair that take the lead Turn downward, and the lowest pair succeed, So shifting and so various is the plan, By which Heaven rules the mixt affairs of man: Vicissitude wheels round the motley crowd, The rich grow poor, the poor become purse-proud; Business is labour, and man's weakness such, Pleasure is labour too, and tires as much; The very sense of it foregoes its use, By repetition pall'd, by age obtuse. Youth lost in dissipation, we deplore, Through life's sad remnant, what no sighs restore; Our years, a fruitless race without a prize, Too many, yet too few to make us wise. Dangling his cane about, and taking snuff, Lothario cries, What philosophic stuff! O querulous and weak!—whose useless brain Once thought of nothing, and now thinks in vain; Whose eye reverted weeps o'er all the past, Whose prospect shows thee a disheartening waste; Would age in thee resign his wintry reign, And youth invigorate that frame again, Renew'd desire would grace with other speech Joys always prized, when placed within our reach. For lift thy palsied head, shake off the gloom That overhangs the borders of thy tomb, See Nature gay as when she first began, With smiles alluring her admirer man; She spreads the morning over eastern hills, Earth glitters with the drops the night distils, The sun obedient at her call appears, To fling his glories o'er the robe she wears, Banks clothed with flowers, groves fill'd with sprightly sounds, The yellow tilth, green meads, rocks, rising grounds, Streams edged with osiers, fattening every field Where'er they flow, now seen and now conceal'd; From the blue rim where skies and mountains meet, Down to the very turf beneath thy feet, Ten thousand charms, that only fools despise, Or pride can look at with indifferent eyes, All speak one language, all with one sweet voice Cry to her universal realm, Rejoice! Man feels the spur of passions and desires, And she gives largely more than he requires; Not that his hours devoted all to Care, Hollow-eyed Abstinence, and lean Despair, The wretch may pine, while to his smell, taste, sight, She holds a Paradise of rich delight; But gently to rebuke his awkward fear, To prove that what she gives, she gives sincere, To banish hesitation, and proclaim His happiness, her dear, her only aim. 'Tis grave Philosophy's absurdest dream, That Heaven's intentions are not what they seem, That only shadows are dispensed below, And earth has no reality but woe. Thus things terrestrial wear a different hue, As youth or age persuades; and neither true: So Flora's wreath through colour'd crystal seen, The rose or lily appears blue or green, But still the imputed tints are those alone The medium represents, and not their own. To rise at noon, sit slipshod and undress'd, To read the news, or fiddle, as seems best, Till half the world comes rattling at his door, To fill the dull vacuity till four; And just when evening turns the blue vault grey, To spend two hours in dressing for the day; To make the Sun a bauble without use, Save for the fruits his heavenly beams produce, Quite to forget, or deem it worth no thought, Who bids him shine, or if he shine or not; Through mere necessity to close his eyes Just when the larks and when the shepherds rise; Is such a life, so tediously the same, So void of all utility or aim, That poor Jonquil with almost every breath Sighs for his exit, vulgarly called death; For he, with all his follies, has a mind Not yet so blank, or fashionably blind, But now and then perhaps a feeble ray Of distant wisdom shoots across his way, By which he reads, that life without a plan, As useless as the moment it began, Serves merely as a soil for discontent To thrive in; an incumbrance ere half spent. Oh weariness beyond what asses feel, That tread the circuit of the cistern wheel; A dull rotation, never at a stay, Yesterday's face twin image of to-day; While conversation, an exhausted stock, Grows drowsy as the clicking of a clock. No need, he cries, of gravity stuff'd out With academic dignity devout, To read wise lectures, vanity the text: Proclaim the remedy, ye learned, next; For truth self-evident with pomp impress'd Is vanity surpassing all the rest. That remedy, not hid in deeps profound, Yet seldom sought where only to be found, While passion turns aside from its due scope The inquirer's aim, that remedy is Hope. Life is His gift, from whom whate'er life needs, And every good and perfect gift proceeds; Bestow'd on man, like all that we partake, Royally, freely, for his bounty's sake; Transient, indeed, as is the fleeting hour, And yet the seed of an immortal flower, Design'd in honour of his endless love, To fill with fragrance his abode above: No trifle, howsoever short it seem, And, howsoever shadowy, no dream; Its value what no thought can ascertain, Nor all an angel's eloquence explain. Men deal with life, as children with their play, Who first misuse, then cast their toys away; Live to no sober purpose, and contend That their Creator had no serious end. When God and man stand opposite in view, Man's disappointment must of course ensue. The just Creator condescends to write, In beams of inextinguishable light, His names of wisdom, goodness, power, and love, On all that blooms below or shines above, To catch the wandering notice of mankind, And teach the world, if not perversely blind, His gracious attributes, and prove the share His offspring hold in his paternal care. If, led from earthly things to things divine, His creature thwart not his august design, Then praise is heard instead of reasoning pride, And captious cavil and complaint subside. Nature, employ'd in her allotted place, Is handmaid to the purposes of Grace; By good vouchsafed makes known superior good, And bliss not seen by blessings understood: That bliss reveal'd in Scripture, with a glow Bright as the covenant-ensuring bow, Fires all his feelings with a noble scorn Of sensual evil, and thus Hope is born. Hope sets the stamp of vanity on all That men have deem'd substantial since the fall, Yet has the wondrous virtue to educe From emptiness itself a real use; And while she takes, as at a father's hand, What health and sober appetite demand, From fading good derives, with chemic art, That lasting happiness, a thankful heart. Hope with uplifted foot set free from earth, Pants for the place of her ethereal birth, On steady wings sails through the immense abyss, Plucks amaranthine joys from bowers of bliss, And crowns the soul, while yet a mourner here, With wreaths like those triumphant spirits wear. Hope, as an anchor firm and sure, holds fast The Christian vessel, and defies the blast. Hope! nothing else can nourish and secure His newborn virtues, and preserve him pure; Hope! let the wretch, once conscious of the joy, Whom now despairing agonies destroy, Speak, for he can, and none so well as he, What treasures centre, what delights in thee. Had he the gems, the spices, and the land That boasts the treasure, all at his command, The fragrant grove, the inestimable mine, Were light, when weigh'd against one smile of thine. Though clasp'd and cradled in his nurse's arms, He shine with all a cherub's artless charms, Man is the genuine offspring of revolt, Stubborn and sturdy, a wild ass's colt; His passions, like the watery stores that sleep Beneath the smiling surface of the deep, Wait but the lashes of a wintry storm, To frown and roar, and shake his feeble form. From infancy through childhood's giddy maze, Froward at school, and fretful in his plays, The puny tyrant burns to subjugate The free republic of the whip-gig state. If one, his equal in athletic frame, Or, more provoking still, of nobler name, Dare step across his arbitrary views, An Iliad, only not in verse, ensues: The little Greeks look trembling at the scales, Till the best tongue, or heaviest hand prevails. Now see him launch'd into the world at large; If priest, supinely droning o'er his charge, Their fleece his pillow, and his weekly drawl, Though short, too long, the price he pays for all. If lawyer, loud whatever cause he plead, But proudest of the worst, if that succeed. Perhaps a grave physician, gathering fees, Punctually paid for lengthening out disease; No Cotton, whose humanity sheds rays That make superior skill his second praise. If arms engage him, he devotes to sport His date of life, so likely to be short; A soldier may be any thing, if brave; So may a tradesman, if not quite a knave. Such stuff the world is made of; and mankind To passion, interest, pleasure, whim resign'd, Insist on, as if each were his own Pope, Forgiveness and the privilege of hope. But Conscience, in some awful silent hour, When captivating lusts have lost their power, Perhaps when sickness, or some fearful dream, Reminds him of religion, hated theme! Starts from the down on which she lately slept, And tells of laws despised, at least not kept, Shows with a pointing finger and no noise, A pale procession of past sinful joys, All witnesses of blessings foully scorn'd, And life abused,—and not to be suborn'd. Mark these, she says; these, summon'd from afar, Begin their march to meet thee at the bar; There find a Judge inexorably just, And perish there, as all presumption must. Peace be to those (such peace as earth can give,) Who live in pleasure, dead even while they live; Born capable indeed of heavenly truth, But down to latest age from earliest youth, Their mind a wilderness through want of care, The plough of wisdom never entering there. Peace (if insensibility may claim A right to the meek honours of her name,) To men of pedigree; their noble race, Emulous always of the nearest place To any throne, except the throne of grace. Let cottagers and unenlighten'd swains Revere the laws they dream that Heaven ordains, Resort on Sundays to the house of prayer, And ask, and fancy they find blessings there; Themselves, perhaps, when weary they retreat To enjoy cool nature in a country seat, To exchange the centre of a thousand trades, For clumps, and lawns, and temples, and cascades, May now and then their velvet cushions take, And seem to pray, for good example sake; Judging, in charity no doubt, the town Pious enough, and having need of none. Kind souls! to teach their tenantry to prize What they themselves, without remorse, despise: Nor hope have they nor fear of aught to come, As well for them had prophecy been dumb; They could have held the conduct they pursue, Had Paul of Tarsus lived and died a Jew; And truth, proposed to reasoners wise as they, Is a pearl cast—completely cast away. They die.—Death lends them, pleased and as in sport, All the grim honours of his ghastly court. Far other paintings grace the chamber now, Where late we saw the mimic landscape glow: The busy heralds hang the sable scene With mournful scutcheons and dim lamps between, Proclaim their titles to the crowd around, But they that wore them move not at the sound; The coronet placed idly at their head, Adds nothing now to the degraded dead, And even the star that glitters on the bier Can only say—Nobility lies here. Peace to all such!—'twere pity to offend By useless censure whom we cannot mend; Life without hope can close but in despair, 'Twas there we found them, and must leave them there. As when two pilgrims in a forest stray, Both may be lost, yet each in his own way, So fares it with the multitudes beguiled In vain opinion's waste and dangerous wild; Ten thousand rove the brakes and thorns among, Some eastward, and some westward, and all wrong. But here, alas! the fatal difference lies, Each man's belief is right in his own eyes; And he that blames what they have blindly chose, Incurs resentment for the love he shows. Say botanist! within whose province fall The cedar and the hyssop on the wall, Of all that deck the lanes, the fields, the bowers, What parts the kindred tribes of weeds and flowers? Sweet scent, or lovely form, or both combined, Distinguish every cultivated kind; The want of both denotes a meaner breed, And Chloe from her garland picks the weed. Thus hopes of every sort, whatever sect Esteem them, sow them, rear them, and protect, If wild in nature, and not duly found, Gethsemane! in thy dear hallowed ground, That cannot bear the blaze of Scripture light, Nor cheer the spirit, nor refresh the sight, Nor animate the soul to Christian deeds, (Oh, cast them from thee!) are weeds, arrant weeds. Ethelred's house, the centre of six ways, Diverging each from each, like equal rays, Himself as bountiful as April rains, Lord paramount of the surrounding plains, Would give relief of bed and board to none But guests that sought it in the appointed One. And they might enter at his open door, Even till his spacious hall would hold no more. He sent a servant forth by every road, To sound his horn, and publish it abroad, That all might mark—knight, menial, high and low, An ordinance it concern'd them much to know. If after all, some headstrong hardy lout Would disobey, though sure to be shut out, Could he with reason murmur at his case, Himself sole author of his own disgrace? No! the decree was just and without flaw, And he that made had right to make the law; His sovereign power and pleasure unrestrain'd, The wrong was his who wrongfully complain'd. Yet half mankind maintain a churlish strife With Him, the Donor of eternal life, Because the deed, by which his love confirms The largess he bestows, prescribes the terms. Compliance with his will your lot ensures, Accept it only, and the boon is yours: And sure it is as kind to smile and give, As with a frown to say, Do this, and live. Love is not pedler's trumpery bought and sold, He will give freely, or he will withhold; His soul abhors a mercenary thought, And him as deeply who abhors it not. He stipulates indeed, but merely this, That man will freely take an unbought bliss, Will trust him for a faithful generous part, Nor set a price upon a willing heart. Of all the ways that seem to promise fair To place you where his saints his presence share, This only can; for this plain cause, express'd In terms as plain, Himself has shut the rest. But oh the strife, the bickering, and debate The tidings of unpurchased Heaven create! The flirted fan, the bridle, and the toss, All speakers, yet all language at a loss. From stuccoed walls smart arguments rebound; And beaus, adepts in every thing profound, Die of disdain, or whistle off the sound. Such is the clamour of rooks, daws, and kites, The explosion of the levell'd tube excites, Where mouldering abbey walls o'erhang the glade, And oaks coeval spread a mournful shade; The screaming nations, hovering in mid air, Loudly resent the stranger's freedom there, And seem to warn him never to repeat His bold intrusion on their dark retreat. Adieu, Vinoso cries, ere yet he sips The purple bumper trembling at his lips, Adieu to all morality! if Grace Make works a vain ingredient in the case. The Christian hope is—Waiter, draw the cork— If I mistake not—Blockhead! with a fork! Without good works, whatever some may boast, Mere folly and delusion—Sir, your toast. My firm persuasion is, at least sometimes, That Heaven will weigh man's virtues and his crimes With nice attention in a righteous scale, And save or damn as these or those prevail. I plant my foot upon this ground of trust, And silence every fear with—God is just. But if perchance on some dull drizzling day A thought intrude, that says, or seems to say, If thus the important cause is to be tried, Suppose the beam should dip on the wrong side? I soon recover from these needless frights, And God is merciful—sets all to rights. Thus, between justice, as my prime support, And mercy, fled to as the last resort, I glide and steal along with heaven in view, And,—pardon me, the bottle stands with you. I never will believe, the colonel cries, The sanguinary schemes that some devise, Who make the good Creator on their plan A being of less equity than man. If appetite, or what divines call lust, Which men comply with even because they must, Be punish'd with perdition, who is pure? Then theirs, no doubt, as well as mine is sure. If sentence of eternal pain belong To every sudden slip and transient wrong, Then Heaven enjoins the fallible and frail A hopeless task, and damns them if they fail. My creed (whatever some creed-makers mean By Athanasian nonsense, or Nicene,) My creed is, he is safe that does his best, And death's a doom sufficient for the rest. Right, says an ensign; and, for aught I see, Your faith and mine substantially agree: The best of every man's performance here Is to discharge the duties of his sphere. A lawyer's dealing should be just and fair, Honesty shines with great advantage there. Fasting and prayer sit well upon a priest, A decent caution and reserve at least. A soldier's best is courage in the field, With nothing here that wants to be conceal'd; Manly deportment, gallant, easy, gay; A hand as liberal as the light of day; The soldier thus endow'd, who never shrinks, Nor closets up his thought whate'er he thinks, Who scorns to do an injury by stealth, Must go to Heaven—and I must drink his health. Sir Smug! he cries, (for lowest at the board, Just made fifth chaplain of his patron lord, His shoulders witnessing by many a shrug How much his feelings suffer'd, sat Sir Smug,) Your office is to winnow false from true; Come, prophet, drink, and tell us what think you! Sighing and smiling as he takes his glass, Which they that woo preferment rarely pass, Fallible man, the church-bred youth replies, Is still found fallible, however wise; And differing judgements serve but to declare That truth lies somewhere, if we knew but where. Of all it ever was my lot to read Of critics now alive or long since dead, The book of all the world that charmed me most Was,—well-a-day, the title-page was lost. The writer well remarks, a heart that knows. To take with gratitude what Heaven bestows, With prudence always ready at our call, To guide our use of it, is all in all. Doubtless it is.—To which, of my own store, I superadd a few essentials more; But these, excuse the liberty I take, I waive just now, for conversation sake.— Spoke like an oracle, they all exclaim, And add Right Reverend to Smug's honour'd name. And yet our lot is given us in a land Where busy arts are never at a stand; Where Science points her telescopic eye, Familiar with the wonders of the sky; Where bold Inquiry, diving out of sight, Brings many a precious pearl of truth to light; Where nought eludes the persevering quest That fashion, taste, or luxury suggest. But above all, in her own light array'd, See Mercy's grand apocalypse display'd! The sacred book no longer suffers wrong, Bound in the fetters of an unknown tongue, But speaks with plainness art could never mend, What simplest minds can soonest comprehend. God gives the word, the preachers throng around, Live from his lips, and spread the glorious sound: That sound bespeaks Salvation on her way, The trumpet of a life-restoring day; 'Tis heard where England's eastern glory shines, And in the gulfs of her Cornubian mines. And still it spreads. See Germany send forth Her sons The Moravian missionaries in Greenland. Vide Krantz. C. to pour it on the farthest north; Fired with a zeal peculiar, they defy The rage and rigour of a polar sky, And plant successfully sweet Sharon's rose On icy plains and in eternal snows. Oh bless'd within the enclosure of your rocks, Nor herds have ye to boast, nor bleating flocks, No fertilizing streams your fields divide, That show reversed the villas on their side; No groves have ye; no cheerful sound of bird, Or voice of turtle in your land is heard; Nor grateful eglantine regales the smell Of those that walk at evening where ye dwell; But Winter, arm'd with terrors here unknown, Sits absolute on his unshaken throne, Piles up his stores amidst the frozen waste, And bids the mountains he has built, stand fast; Beckons the legions of his storms away From happier scenes, to make your land a prey, Proclaims the soil a conquest he has won, And scorns to share it with the distant Sun. —Yet Truth is yours, remote unenvied isle! And peace, the genuine offspring of her smile; The pride of letter'd ignorance, that binds In chains of error our accomplish'd minds, That decks with all the splendour of the true, A false religion, is unknown to you. Nature indeed vouchsafes for our delight The sweet vicissitudes of day and night; Soft airs and genial moisture feed and cheer Field, fruit, and flower, and every creature here; But brighter beams than his who fires the skies Have risen at length on your admiring eyes, That shoot into your darkest caves the day From which our nicer optics turn away. Here see the encouragement Grace gives to vice, The dire effect of mercy without price! What were they? what some fools are made by art They were by nature, atheists, head and heart. The gross idolatry blind heathens teach Was too refined for them, beyond their reach. Not even the glorious sun, though men revere The monarch most that seldom will appear, And though his beams that quicken where they shine, May claim some right to be esteem'd divine,— Not even the sun, desirable as rare, Could bend one knee, engage one votary there; They were, what base credulity believes True Christians are, dissemblers, drunkards, thieves. The full-gorged savage at his nauseous feast Spent half the darkness, and snored out the rest,— Was one whom justice, on an equal plan Denouncing death upon the sins of man, Might almost have indulged with an escape, Chargeable only with a human shape. What are they now?—Morality may spare Her grave concern, her kind suspicions there. The wretch that once sang wildly, danced, and laugh'd, And suck'd in dizzy madness with his draught, Has wept a silent flood, reversed his ways, Is sober, meek, benevolent, and prays; Feeds sparingly, communicates his store, Abhors the craft he boasted of before, And he that stole has learn'd to steal no more. Well spake the prophet, Let the desert sing, Where sprang the thorn the spiry fir shall spring, And where unsightly and rank thistles grew, Shall grow the myrtle and luxuriant yew. Go now, and with important tone demand On what foundation virtue is to stand, If self-exalting claims be turn'd adrift, And grace be grace indeed, and life a gift: The poor reclaim'd inhabitant, his eyes Glistening at once with pity and surprise, Amazed that shadows should obscure the sight Of one whose birth was in a land of light, Shall answer, Hope, sweet Hope, has set me free, And made all pleasures else mere dross to me. These, amidst scenes as waste as if denied The common care that waits on all beside, Wild as if Nature there, void of all good, Play'd only gambols in a frantic mood, (Yet charge not heavenly skill with having plann'd A plaything world, unworthy of his hand); Can see his love, though secret evil lurks In all we touch, stamp'd plainly on his works; Deem life a blessing with its numerous woes, Nor spurn away a gift a God bestows. Hard task indeed o'er arctic seas to roam! Is hope exotic? grows it not at home? Yes; but an object bright as orient morn May press the eye too closely to be borne; A distant virtue we can all confess, It hurts our pride and moves our envy less. Leuconomus (beneath well sounding Greek I slur a name a poet must not speak,) Stood pilloried on infamy's high stage, And bore the pelting scorn of half an age, The very butt of slander, and the blot For every dart that malice ever shot. The man that mention'd him, at once dismiss'd All mercy from his lips, and sneer'd and hiss'd; His crimes were such as Sodom never knew, And Perjury stood up to swear all true; His aim was mischief, and his zeal pretence, His speech rebellion against common sense; A knave, when tried on honesty's plain rule, And when by that of reason, a mere fool, The world's best comfort was, his doom was pass'd, Die when he might, he must be damn'd at last. Now, Truth, perform thine office; waft aside The curtain drawn by prejudice and pride, Reveal (the man is dead) to wondering eyes This more than monster in his proper guise. He loved the world that hated him; the tear That dropp'd upon his Bible was sincere. Assail'd by scandal and the tongue of strife, His only answer was a blameless life, And he that forged and he that threw the dart, Had each a brother's interest in his heart. Paul's love of Christ, and steadiness unbribed, Were copied close in him, and well transcribed; He follow'd Paul; his zeal a kindred flame, His apostolic charity the same, Like him, cross'd cheerfully tempestuous seas, Forsaking country, kindred, friends, and ease; Like him he labour'd, and like him content To bear it, suffer'd shame where'er he went. Blush, Calumny; and write upon his tomb, If honest eulogy can spare thee room, Thy deep repentance of thy thousand lies, Which, aim'd at him, have pierced the offended skies; And say, Blot out my sin, confess'd, deplored, Against thine image in thy saint, O Lord! No blinder bigot, I maintain it still, Than he who must have pleasure, come what will: He laughs, whatever weapon Truth may draw, And deems her sharp artillery mere straw. Scripture indeed is plain, but God and he On scripture ground are sure to disagree; Some wiser rule must teach him how to live Than that his Maker has seen fit to give, Supple and flexible as Indian cane, To take the bend his appetites ordain, Contrived to suit frail nature's crazy case, And reconcile his lusts with saving grace. By this, with nice precision of design, He draws upon life's map a zigzag line, That shows how far 'tis safe to follow sin, And where his danger and God's wrath begin. By this he forms, as pleased he sports along, His well-poised estimate of right and wrong, And finds the modish manners of the day, Though loose, as harmless as an infant's play. Build by whatever plan caprice decrees, With what materials, on what ground you please, Your hope shall stand unblamed, perhaps admired, If not that hope the Scripture has required: The strange conceits, vain projects, and wild dreams, With which hypocrisy for ever teems, (Though other follies strike the public eye, And raise a laugh), pass unmolested by; But if, unblameable in word and thought, A man arise, a man whom God has taught, With all Elijah's dignity of tone, And all the love of the beloved John, To storm the citadels they build in air, And smite the untemper'd wall, 'tis death to spare, To sweep away all refuges of lies, And place, instead of quirks themselves devise, Lama sabacthani before their eyes,— To prove that without Christ all gain is loss, All hope despair, that stands not on his cross,— Except the few his God may have impress'd, A tenfold frenzy seizes all the rest. Throughout mankind, the Christian kind at least, There dwells a consciousness in every breast, That folly ends where genuine hope begins, And he that finds his heaven must lose his sins. Nature opposes with her utmost force This riving stroke, this ultimate divorce, And, while religion seems to be her view, Hates with a deep sincerity the true: For this, of all that ever influenced man, Since Abel worshipp'd, or the world began, This only spares no lust, admits no plea, But makes him, if at all, completely free; Sounds forth the signal, as she mounts her car, Of an eternal, universal war; Rejects all treaty, penetrates all wiles, Scorns with the same indifference frowns and smiles, Drives through the realms of Sin, where Riot reels, And grinds his crown beneath her burning wheels! Hence all that is in man, pride, passion, art, Powers of the mind, and feelings of the heart, Insensible of Truth's almighty charms, Starts at her first approach, and sounds to arms! While Bigotry, with well dissembled fears, His eyes shut fast, his fingers in his ears, Mighty to parry and push by God's word With senseless noise, his argument the sword, Pretends a zeal for godliness and grace, And spits abhorrence in the Christian's face. Parent of Hope, immortal Truth, make known Thy deathless wreaths, and triumphs all thine own! The silent progress of thy power is such, Thy means so feeble, and despised so much, That few believe the wonders thou hast wrought, And none can teach them but whom thou hast taught. Oh see me sworn to serve thee, and command A painter's skill into a poet's hand, That while I trembling trace a work divine, Fancy may stand aloof from the design, And light and shade and every stroke be thine. If ever thou hast felt another's pain, If ever when he sigh'd, hast sigh'd again, If ever on thine eyelid stood the tear That pity had engender'd, drop one here. This man was happy,—had the world's good word, And with it every joy it can afford; Friendship and love seem'd tenderly at strife, Which most should sweeten his untroubled life; Politely learn'd, and of a gentle race, Good breeding and good sense gave all a grace, And whether at the toilet of the fair He laugh'd and trifled, made him welcome there; Or if in masculine debate he shared, Ensured him mute attention and regard. Alas how changed! expressive of his mind, His eyes are sunk, arms folded, head reclined; Those aweful syllables, hell, death, and sin, Though whisper'd, plainly tell what works within, That conscience there performs her proper part, And writes a doomsday sentence on his heart. Forsaking, and forsaken of all friends, He now perceives where earthly pleasure ends; Hard task! for one who lately knew no care, And harder still as learn'd beneath despair: His hours no longer pass unmark'd away, A dark importance saddens every day; He hears the notice of the clock, perplex'd, And cries, Perhaps eternity strikes next; Sweet music is no longer music here, And laughter sounds like madness in his ear; His grief the world of all her power disarms, Wine has no taste, and beauty has no charms: God's holy word, once trivial in his view, Now by the voice of his experience true, Seems, as it is, the fountain whence alone Must spring that hope he pants to make his own. Now let the bright reverse be known abroad; Say, man's a worm, and power belongs to God. As when a felon, whom his country's laws Have justly doom'd for some atrocious cause, Expects in darkness and heart-chilling fears, The shameful close of all his mispent years, If chance, on heavy pinions slowly borne, A tempest usher in the dreaded morn, Upon his dungeon walls the lightnings play, The thunder seems to summon him away, The warder at the door his key applies, Shoots back the bolt, and all his courage dies: If then, just then, all thoughts of mercy lost, When hope, long lingering, at last yields the ghost, The sound of pardon pierce his startled ear, He drops at once his fetters and his fear, A transport glows in all he looks and speaks, And the first thankful tears bedew his cheeks: Joy, far superior joy, that much outweighs The comfort of a few poor added days, Invades, possesses, and o'erwhelms the soul Of him whom hope has with a touch made whole. 'Tis heaven, all heaven descending on the wings Of the glad legions of the King of kings; 'Tis more,—'tis God diffused through every part, 'Tis God himself triumphant in his heart. Oh, welcome now the sun's once hated light, His noonday beams were never half so bright. Not kindred minds alone are call'd to employ Their hours, their days, in listening to his joy, Unconscious nature, all that he surveys, Rocks, groves, and streams must join him in his praise. These are thy glorious works, eternal Truth, The scoff of wither'd age and beardless youth; These move the censure and illiberal grin Of fools that hate thee and delight in sin: But these shall last when night has quench'd the pole, And heaven is all departed as a scroll: And when, as Justice has long since decreed, This earth shall blaze, and a new world succeed, Then these thy glorious works, and they that share That Hope which can alone exclude despair, Shall live exempt from weakness and decay, The brightest wonders of an endless day. Happy the bard, (if that fair name belong To him that blends no fable with his song,) Whose lines uniting, by an honest art, The faithful monitor's and poet's part, Seek to delight, that they may mend mankind, And, while they captivate, inform the mind; Still happier, if he till a thankful soil, And fruit reward his honourable toil: But happier far who comfort those that wait To hear plain truth at Judah's hallow'd gate; Their language simple, as their manners meek, No shining ornaments have they to seek, Nor labour they, nor time nor talents waste, In sorting flowers to suit a fickle taste; But while they speak the wisdom of the skies, Which art can only darken and disguise, The abundant harvest, recompense divine, Repays their work,—the gleaning only, mine. CHARITY. Quâ nihil majus meliusve terris Fata donavere bonique divi, Nec dabunt, quamvis redeant in aurum Tempora priscum. —Hor. Lib. iv. Ode ii. Fairest and foremost of the train that wait On man's most dignified and happiest state, Whether we name thee Charity or Love, Chief grace below, and all in all above, Prosper (I press thee with a powerful plea) A task I venture on, impell'd by thee: Oh never seen but in thy bless'd effects, Nor felt but in the soul that Heaven selects, Who seeks to praise thee, and to make thee known To other hearts, must have thee in his own. Come, prompt me with benevolent desires, Teach me to kindle at thy gentle fires, And though disgraced and slighted, to redeem A poet's name, by making thee the theme. God working ever on a social plan, By various ties attaches man to man: He made at first, though free and unconfined, One man the common father of the kind, That every tribe, though placed as he sees best, Where seas or deserts part them from the rest, Differing in language, manners, or in face, Might feel themselves allied to all the race. When Cook—lamented, and with tears as just As ever mingled with heroic dust, Steer'd Britain's oak into a world unknown, And in his country's glory sought his own, Wherever he found man, to nature true, The rights of man were sacred in his view; He sooth'd with gifts and greeted with a smile The simple native of the new found isle; He spurn'd the wretch that slighted or withstood The tender argument of kindred blood, Nor would endure that any should control His freeborn brethren of the southern pole. But though some nobler minds a law respect, That none shall with impunity neglect, In baser souls unnumber'd evils meet, To thwart its influence and its end defeat. While Cook is loved for savage lives he saved, See Cortes odious for a world enslaved! Where wast thou then, sweet Charity, where then, Thou tutelary friend of helpless men? Wast thou in monkish cells and nunneries found, Or building hospitals on English ground? No!—Mammon makes the world his legatee Through fear, not love; and Heaven abhors the fee. Wherever found, (and all men need thy care,) Nor age nor infancy could find thee there. The hand that slew till it could slay no more, Was glued to the swordhilt with Indian gore. Their prince, as justly seated on his throne As vain imperial Philip on his own, Trick'd out of all his royalty by art, That stripp'd him bare, and broke his honest heart, Died by the sentence of a shaven priest, For scorning what they taught him to detest. How dark the veil that intercepts the blaze Of Heaven's mysterious purposes and ways; God stood not, though he seem'd to stand, aloof, And at this hour the conqueror feels the proof: The wreath he won drew down an instant curse, The fretting plague is in the public purse, The canker'd spoil corrodes the pining state, Starved by that indolence their mines create. Oh, could their ancient Incas rise again, How would they take up Israel's taunting strain! Art thou too fallen, Iberia! Do we see The robber and the murderer weak as we? Thou, that hast wasted earth, and dared despise Alike the wrath and mercy of the skies, Thy pomp is in the grave, thy glory laid Low in the pits thine avarice has made. We come with joy from our eternal rest, To see the oppressor in his turn oppress'd. Art thou the God the thunder of whose hand Roll'd over all our desolated land, Shook principalities and kingdoms down, And made the mountains tremble at his frown? The sword shall light upon thy boasted powers, And waste them, as thy sword has wasted ours. 'Tis thus Omnipotence his law fulfils, And vengeance executes what justice wills. Again—the band of commerce was design'd To associate all the branches of mankind, And if a boundless plenty be the robe, Trade is the golden girdle of the globe. Wise to promote whatever end he means, God opens fruitful Nature's various scenes, Each climate needs what other climes produce, And offers something to the general use; No land but listens to the common call, And in return receives supply from all. This genial intercourse and mutual aid Cheers what were else an universal shade, Calls Nature from her ivy-mantled den, And softens human rockwork into men. Ingenious Art with her expressive face, Steps forth to fashion and refine the race,— Not only fills Necessity's demand, But overcharges her capacious hand: Capricious taste itself can crave no more Than she supplies from her abounding store: She strikes out all that luxury can ask, And gains new vigour at her endless task. Hers is the spacious arch, the shapely spire, The painter's pencil, and the poet's lyre; From her the canvass borrows light and shade, And verse, more lasting, hues that never fade. She guides the finger o'er the dancing keys, Gives difficulty all the grace of ease, And pours a torrent of sweet notes around, Fast as the thirsting ear can drink the sound. These are the gifts of Art, and Art thrives most Where commerce has enrich'd the busy coast; He catches all improvements in his flight, Spreads foreign wonders in his country's sight, Imports what others have invented well, And stirs his own to match them or excel. 'Tis thus reciprocating each with each, Alternately the nations learn and teach; While Providence enjoins to every soul An union with the vast terraqueous whole. Heaven speed the canvass gallantly unfurl'd To furnish and accommodate a world, To give the pole the produce of the sun, And knit the unsocial climates into one!— Soft airs and gentle heavings of the wave Impel the fleet whose errand is to save, To succour wasted regions, and replace The smile of opulence in sorrow's face!— Let nothing adverse, nothing unforeseen, Impede the bark that ploughs the deep serene, Charged with a freight transcending in its worth The gems of India, nature's rarest birth, That flies, like Gabriel on his Lord's commands, A herald of God's love to pagan lands!— But, ah! what wish can prosper, or what prayer, For merchants rich in cargoes of despair, Who drive a loathsome traffic, gauge and span And buy the muscles and the bones of man? The tender ties of father, husband, friend, All bonds of nature in that moment end, And each endures, while yet he draws his breath, A stroke as fatal as the scythe of death. The sable warrior, frantic with regret Of her he loves and never can forget, Loses in tears the far receding shore, But not the thought that they must meet no more; Deprived of her and freedom at a blow, What has he left that he can yet forego? Yes, to deep sadness sullenly resign'd, He feels his body's bondage in his mind, Puts off his generous nature, and, to suit His manners with his fate, puts on the brute. Oh most degrading of all ills that wait On man, a mourner in his best estate! All other sorrows virtue may endure, And find submission more than half a cure; Grief is itself a medicine, and bestow'd To improve the fortitude that bears the load, To teach the wanderer, as his woes increase, The path of Wisdom, all whose paths are peace. But slavery!—Virtue dreads it as her grave: Patience itself is meanness in a slave: Or if the will and sovereignty of God Bid suffer it awhile, and kiss the rod, Wait for the dawning of a brighter day, And snap the chain the moment when you may. Nature imprints upon whate'er we see, That has a heart and life in it, Be free; The beasts are charter'd,—neither age nor force Can quell the love of freedom in a horse: He breaks the cord that held him at the rack, And, conscious of an unincumber'd back, Snuffs up the morning air, forgets the rein, Loose fly his forelock and his ample mane, Responsive to the distant neigh he neighs, Nor stops, till, overleaping all delays, He finds the pasture where his fellows graze. Canst thou, and honour'd with a Christian name, Buy what is woman-born, and feel no shame? Trade in the blood of innocence, and plead Expedience as a warrant for the deed? So may the wolf, whom famine has made bold To quit the forest and invade the fold; So may the ruffian, who with ghostly glide, Dagger in hand, steals close to your bedside; Not he, but his emergence forced the door, He found it inconvenient to be poor. Has God then given its sweetness to the cane, Unless his laws be trampled on,—in vain? Built a brave world, which cannot yet subsist, Unless his right to rule it be dismiss'd? Impudent blasphemy! So Folly pleads, And, Avarice being judge, with ease succeeds. But grant the plea, and let it stand for just, That man make man his prey, because he must; Still there is room for pity to abate, And sooth the sorrows of so sad a state. A Briton knows, or if he knows it not, The Scripture placed within his reach, he ought, That souls have no discriminating hue, Alike important in their Maker's view; That none are free from blemish since the fall, And love divine has paid one price for all. The wretch, that works and weeps without relief, Has one that notices his silent grief. He, from whose hands alone all power proceeds, Ranks its abuse among the foulest deeds, Considers all injustice with a frown; But marks the man that treads his fellow down. Begone! the whip and bell in that hard hand Are hateful ensigns of usurp'd command; Not Mexico could purchase kings a claim To scourge him, weariness his only blame. Remember, Heaven has an avenging rod; To smite the poor is treason against God He that oppresseth the poor, reproacheth his Maker. —Proverbs, xiv. 31.. Trouble is grudgingly and hardly brook'd, While life's sublimest joys are overlook'd. We wander o'er a sunburnt thirsty soil, Murmuring and weary of our daily toil, Forget to enjoy the palm-tree's offer'd shade, Or taste the fountain in the neighbouring glade: Else who would lose, that had the power to improve, The occasion of transmuting fear to love? Oh, 'tis a godlike privilege to save, And he that scorns it is himself a slave.— Inform his mind; one flash of heavenly day Would heal his heart, and melt his chains away; “Beauty for ashes” is a gift indeed, And slaves, by truth enlarged, are doubly freed. Then would he say, submissive at thy feet, While gratitude and love made service sweet, My dear deliverer out of hopeless night, Whose bounty bought me but to give me light, I was a bondman on my native plain, Sin forged, and ignorance made fast the chain; Thy lips have shed instruction as the dew, Taught me what path to shun, and what pursue; Farewell my former joys! I sigh no more For Africa's once loved, benighted shore,— Serving a benefactor I am free, At my best home, if not exiled from thee. Some men make gain a fountain, whence proceeds A stream of liberal and heroic deeds; The swell of pity, not to be confined Within the scanty limits of the mind, Disdains the bank, and throws the golden sands, A rich deposit, on the bordering lands; These have an ear for His paternal call, Who makes some rich for the supply of all, God's gift with pleasure in his praise employ, And Thornton is familiar with the joy. Oh, could I worship aught beneath the skies, That earth hath seen, or fancy can devise, Thine altar, sacred Liberty, should stand, Built by no mercenary vulgar hand, With fragrant turf and flowers as wild and fair As ever dress'd a bank or scented summer air. Duly, as ever on the mountain's height The peep of morning shed a dawning light; Again, when evening in her sober vest Drew the grey curtain of the fading west, My soul should yield thee willing thanks and praise, For the chief blessings of my fairest days: But that were sacrilege;—praise is not thine, But his who gave thee, and preserves thee mine: Else I would say, and as I spake bid fly A captive bird into the boundless sky, This triple realm adores thee;—thou art come From Sparta hither, and art here at home. We feel thy force still active, at this hour Enjoy immunity from priestly power, While conscience, happier than in ancient years, Owns no superior but the God she fears. Propitious spirit! yet expunge a wrong Thy rights have suffer'd, and our land, too long. Teach mercy to ten thousand hearts that share The fears and hopes of a commercial care; Prisons expect the wicked, and were built To bind the lawless and to punish guilt, But shipwreck, earthquake, battle, fire, and flood, Are mighty mischiefs, not to be withstood, And honest merit stands on slippery ground, Where covert guile and artifice abound: Let just restraint for public peace design'd, Chain up the wolves and tigers of mankind, The foe of virtue has no claim to thee, But let insolvent innocence go free. Patron, of else the most despised of men, Accept the tribute of a stranger's pen; Verse, like the laurel its immortal meed, Should be the guerdon of a noble deed, I may alarm thee, but I fear the shame, (Charity chosen as my theme and aim) I must incur, forgetting Howard's name. Blest, with all wealth can give thee, to resign Joys doubly sweet to feelings quick as thine, To quit the bliss thy rural scenes bestow, To seek a nobler amidst scenes of woe, To traverse seas, range kingdoms, and bring home Not the proud monuments of Greece or Rome, But knowledge such as only dungeons teach, And only sympathy like thine could reach; That grief, sequester'd from the public stage, Might smooth her feathers and enjoy her cage, Speaks a divine ambition, and a zeal The boldest patriot might be proud to feel. Oh that the voice of clamour and debate, That pleads for peace till it disturbs the state, Were hush'd in favour of thy generous plea, The poor thy clients, and Heaven's smile thy fee! Philosophy that does not dream or stray, Walks arm in arm with Nature all his way, Compasses earth, dives into it, ascends Whatever steep enquiry recommends, Sees planetary wonders smoothly roll Round other systems under her control, Drinks wisdom at the milky stream of light That cheers the silent journey of the night, And brings at his return a bosom charged With rich instruction, and a soul enlarged. The treasured sweets of the capacious plan That Heaven spreads wide before the view of man, All prompt his pleased pursuit, and to pursue Still prompt him, with a pleasure always new; He too has a connecting power, and draws Man to the centre of the common cause, Aiding a dubious and deficient sight With a new medium and a purer light. All truth is precious, if not all divine, And what dilates the powers must needs refine. He reads the skies, and watching every change, Provides the faculties an ampler range, And wins mankind, as his attempts prevail, A prouder station on the general scale. But reason still, unless divinely taught, Whate'er she learns, learns nothing as she ought; The lamp of revelation only, shows, What human wisdom cannot but oppose, That man in nature's richest mantle clad, And graced with all philosophy can add, Though fair without, and luminous within, Is still the progeny and heir of sin. Thus taught, down falls the plumage of his pride, He feels his need of an unerring guide, And knows that falling he shall rise no more, Unless the power that bade him stand, restore. This is indeed philosophy; this known, Makes wisdom, worthy of the name, his own; And without this, whatever he discuss, Whether the space between the stars and us, Whether he measure earth, compute the sea, Weigh sunbeams, carve a fly, or spit a flea, The solemn trifler with his boasted skill Toils much, and is a solemn trifler still; Blind was he born, and his misguided eyes Grown dim in trifling studies, blind he dies. Self-knowledge truly learn'd, of course implies The rich possession of a nobler prize, For self to self, and God to man reveal'd, (Two themes to nature's eye for ever seal'd,) Are taught by rays that fly with equal pace From the same centre of enlightening grace. Here stay thy foot; how copious and how clear The o'erflowing well of Charity springs here! Hark! 'tis the music of a thousand rills, Some through the groves, some down the sloping hills, Winding a secret or an open course, And all supplied from an eternal source. The ties of Nature do but feebly bind, And commerce partially reclaims mankind; Philosophy, without his heavenly guide, May blow up self-conceit, and nourish pride, But while his province is the reasoning part, Has still a veil of midnight on his heart: 'Tis truth divine exhibited on earth, Gives Charity her being and her birth. Suppose (when thought is warm and fancy flows, What will not argument sometimes suppose?) An isle possess'd by creatures of our kind, Endued with reason, yet by nature blind. Let supposition lend her aid once more, And land some grave optician on the shore: He claps his lens, if haply they may see, Close to the part where vision ought to be; But finds that though his tubes assist the sight, They cannot give it, or make darkness light. He reads wise lectures, and describes aloud A sense they know not, to the wondering crowd, He talks of light, and the prismatic hues, As men of depth in erudition use, But all he gains for his harangue is—Well— What monstrous lies some travellers will tell! The soul whose sight all-quickening grace renews Takes the resemblance of the good she views, As diamonds stript of their opaque disguise, Reflect the noonday glory of the skies. She speaks of Him, her author, guardian, friend, Whose love knew no beginning, knows no end, In language warm as all that love inspires, And in the glow of her intense desires Pants to communicate her noble fires. She sees a world stark blind to what employs Her eager thought and feeds her flowing joys, Though wisdom hail them, heedless of her call, Flies to save some, and feels a pang for all: Herself as weak as her support is strong, She feels that frailty she denied so long, And from a knowledge of her own disease, Learns to compassionate the sick she sees. Here see, acquitted of all vain pretence, The reign of genuine Charity commence; Though scorn repay her sympathetic tears, She still is kind, and still she perseveres; The truth she loves, a sightless world blaspheme, 'Tis childish dotagc, a delirious dream, The danger they discern not, they deny, Laugh at their only remedy, and die. But still a soul thus touch'd can never cease, Whoever threatens war, to speak of peace. Pure in her aim and in her temper mild, Her wisdom seems the weakness of a child; She makes excuses where she might condemn, Reviled by those that hate her, prays for them; Suspicion lurks not in her artless breast, The worst suggested, she believes the best; Not soon provoked, however stung and teased, And if perhaps made angry, soon appeased; She rather waives than will dispute her right, And injured, makes forgiveness her delight. Such was the portrait an apostle drew, The bright original was one he knew, Heaven held his hand, the likeness must be true. When one that holds communion with the skies Has fill'd his urn where these pure waters rise, And once more mingles with us meaner things, 'Tis even as if an Angel shook his wings: Immortal fragrance fills the circuit wide, That tells us whence his treasures are supplied. So when a ship, well freighted with the stores The sun matures on India's spicey shores, Has dropt her anchor and her canvass furl'd, In some safe haven of our western world, 'Twere vain enquiry to what port she went, The gale informs us, laden with the scent. Some seek, when queasy conscience has its qualms, To lull the painful malady with alms: But charity not feign'd intends alone Another's good,—theirs centres in their own; And too short-lived to reach the realms of peace, Must cease for ever when the poor shall cease. Flavia, most tender of her own good name, Is rather careless of a sister's fame: Her superfluity the poor supplies, But if she touch a character, it dies. The seeming virtue weigh'd against the vice, She deems all safe, for she has paid the price; No charity but alms aught values she, Except in porcelain on her mantle-tree. How many deeds with which the world has rung, From pride in league with ignorance have sprung! But God o'errules all human follies still, And bends the tough materials to his will. A conflagration or a wintry flood Has left some hundreds without home or food, Extravagance and avarice shall subscribe, While fame and self-complacence are the bribe. The brief proclaim'd, it visits every pew, But first the 'Squire's, a compliment but due; With slow deliberation he unties His glittering purse, that envy of all eyes, And while the clerk just puzzles out the psalm, Slides guinea behind guinea in his palm; Till finding, what he might have found before, A smaller piece amidst the precious store, Pinch'd close between his finger and his thumb, He half exhibits, and then drops the sum. Gold to be sure!—Throughout the town 'tis told, How the good 'Squire gives never less than gold. From motives such as his, though not the best, Springs in due time supply for the distress'd, Not less effectual than what love bestows, Except—that office clips it as it goes. But lest I seem to sin against a friend, And wound the grace I mean to recommend, (Though vice derided with a just design Implies no trespass against love divine,) Once more I would adopt the graver style; A teacher should be sparing of his smile. Unless a love of virtue light the flame, Satire is, more than those he brands, to blame; He hides behind a magisterial air His own offences, and strips others bare, Affects indeed a most humane concern, That men, if gently tutor'd, will not learn, That mulish folly, not be reclaim'd By softer methods, must be made ashamed,— But (I might instance in St. Patrick's dean) Too often rails to gratify his spleen. Most satirists are indeed a public scourge; Their mildest physic is a farrier's purge; Their acrid temper turns, as soon as stirr'd, The milk of their good purpose all to curd. Their zeal begotten, as their works rehearse, By lean despair upon an empty purse, The wild assassins start into the street, Prepared to poignard whomsoe'er they meet. No skill in swordsmanship however just, Can be secure against a madman's thrust; And even virtue, so unfairly match'd, Although immortal, may be prick'd or scratch'd. When scandal has new-minted an old lie, Or tax'd invention for a fresh supply, 'Tis call'd a satire, and the world appears Gathering around it with erected ears; A thousand names are toss'd into the crowd, Some whisper'd softly, and some twang'd aloud, Just as the sapience of an author's brain Suggests it safe or dangerous to be plain. Strange! how the frequent interjected dash Quickens a market and helps off the trash; The important letters that include the rest Serve as a key to those that are suppress'd; Conjecture gripes the victims in his paw, The world is charm'd, and Scrib escapes the law. So when the cold damp shades of night prevail, Worms may be caught by either head or tail; Forcibly drawn from many a close recess, They meet with little pity, no redress; Plunged in the stream they lodge upon the mud, Food for the famish'd rovers of the flood. All zeal for a reform that gives offence To peace and charity, is mere pretence; A bold remark, but which, if well applied, Would humble many a towering poet's pride. Perhaps the man was in a sportive fit, And had no other play-place for his wit; Perhaps, enchanted with the love of fame, He sought the jewel in his neighbour's shame; Perhaps—whatever end he might pursue, The cause of virtue could not be his view. At every stroke wit flashes in our eyes, The turns are quick, the polish'd points surprise, But shine with cruel and tremendous charms, That while they please, possess us with alarms: So have I seen, (and hasten'd to the sight On all the wings of holiday delight,) Where stands that monument of ancient power, Named with emphatic dignity, the Tower, Guns, halberts, swords, and pistols, great and small, In starry forms disposed upon the wall; We wonder, as we gazing stand below, That brass and steel should make so fine a show; But though we praise the exact designer's skill, Account them implements of mischief still. No works shall find acceptance in that day When all disguises shall be rent away, That square not truly with the Scripture plan, Nor spring from love to God, or love to man. As he ordains things sordid in their birth, To be resolved into their parent earth, And though the soul shall seek superior orbs, Whate'er this world produces, it absorbs; So self starts nothing but what tends apace, Home to the goal where it began the race. Such as our motive is our aim must be, If this be servile, that can ne'er be free; If self employ us, whatsoe'er is wrought, We glorify that self, not Him we ought: Such virtues had need prove their own reward, The judge of all men owes them no regard. True Charity, a plant divinely nursed, Fed by the love from which it rose at first, Thrives against hope, and in the rudest scene Storms but enliven its unfading green; Exuberant is the shadow it supplies, Its fruit on earth, its growth above the skies. To look at Him who form'd us and redeem'd, So glorious now, though once so disesteem'd, To see a God stretch forth his human hand, To uphold the boundless scenes of his command,— To recollect that in a form like ours He bruised beneath his feet the infernal powers, Captivity led captive, rose to claim The wreath he won so dearly in our name; That throned above all height he condescends To call the few that trust in him his friends; That in the heaven of heavens, that space he deems Too scanty for the exertion of his beams, And shines, as if impatient to bestow Life and a kingdom upon worms below; That sight imparts a never dying flame, Though feeble in degree, in kind the same. Like Him the soul thus kindled from above Spreads wide her arms of universal love, And still enlarged as she receives the grace, Includes creation in her close embrace. Behold a Christian!—and without the fires The founder of that name alone inspires, Though all accomplishments, all knowledge meet, To make the shining prodigy complete, Whoever boasts that name—behold a cheat! Were love, in these the world's last doting years, As frequent, as the want of it appears, The churches warm'd, they would no longer hold Such frozen figures, stiff as they are cold; Relenting forms would lose their power or cease, And e'en the dipp'd and sprinkled, live in peace: Each heart would quit its prison in the breast, And flow in free communion with the rest. The statesman skill'd in projects dark and deep, Might burn his useless Machiavel, and sleep; His budget often fill'd, yet always poor, Might swing at ease behind his study door, No longer prey upon our annual rents, Nor scare the nation with its big contents: Disbanded legions freely might depart, And slaying man would cease to be an art. No learned disputants would take the field, Sure not to conquer, and sure not to yield; Both sides deceived, if rightly understood, Pelting each other for the public good. Did Charity prevail, the press would prove A vehicle of virtue, truth, and love; And I might spare myself the pains to show What few can learn, and all suppose they know. Thus have I sought to grace a serious lay With many a wild indeed but flowery spray, In hopes to gain, what else I must have lost, The attention pleasure has so much engross'd. But if unhappily deceived I dream, And prove too weak for so divine a theme, Let Charity forgive me a mistake That zeal, not vanity, has chanced to make, And spare the poet for his subject sake. CONVERSATION. Nam neque me tantum venientis sibilus austri, Nec percussa juvant fluctû tam litora, nec quæ Saxosas inter decurrunt flumina valles. Virg. Ecl. 5. Though Nature weigh our talents, and dispense To every man his modicum of sense, And Conversation in its better part May be esteemed a gift and not an art, Yet much depends, as in the tiller's toil, On culture, and the sowing of the soil. Words learn'd by rote a parrot may rehearse, But talking is not always to converse, Not more distinct from harmony divine The constant creaking of a country sign. As alphabets in ivory employ Hour after hour the yet unletter'd boy, Sorting and puzzling with a deal of glee Those seeds of science called his A B C, So language in the mouths of the adult, Witness its insignificant result, Too often proves an implement of play, A toy to sport with, and pass time away. Collect at evening what the day brought forth, Compress the sum into its solid worth, And if it weigh the importance of a fly, The scales are false, or algebra a lie. Sacred interpreter of human thought, How few respect or use thee as they ought! But all shall give account of every wrong Who dare dishonour or defile the tongue, Who prostitute it in the cause of vice, Or sell their glory at a market-price, Who vote for hire, or point it with lampoon, The dear-bought placeman, and the cheap buffoon. There is a prurience in the speech of some, Wrath stays him, or else God would strike them dumb: His wise forbearance has their end in view, They fill their measure and receive their due. The heathen law-givers of ancient days, Names almost worthy of a Christian praise, Would drive them forth from the resort of men, And shut up every satyr in his den. Oh come not ye near innocence and truth, Ye worms that eat into the bud of youth! Infectious as impure, your blighting power Taints in its rudiments the promised flower, Its odour perish'd and its charming hue; Thenceforth 'tis hateful, for it smells of you. Not even the vigorous and headlong rage Of adolescence or a firmer age, Affords a plea allowable or just, For making speech the pamperer of lust; But when the breath of age commits the fault, 'Tis nauseous as the vapour of a vault. So wither'd stumps disgrace the sylvan scene, No longer fruitful and no longer green, The sapless wood divested of the bark Grows fungous, and takes fire at every spark. Oaths terminate, as Paul observes, all strife; Some men have surely then a peaceful life. Whatever subject occupy discourse, The feats of Vestris or the naval force, Asseveration blustering in your face Makes contradiction such an hopeless case; In every tale they tell, or false or true, Well known, or such as no man ever knew, They fix attention, heedless of your pain, With oaths like rivets forced into the brain; And even when sober truth prevails throughout, They swear it, 'till affirmance breeds a doubt. A Persian, humble servant of the Sun, Who, though devout, yet bigotry had none, Hearing a lawyer, grave in his address, With adjurations every word impress, Supposed the man a Bishop, or at least, God's name so much upon his lips, a priest, Bow'd at the close with all his graceful airs, And begg'd an interest in his frequent prayers. Go quit the rank to which ye stood preferr'd, Henceforth associate in one common herd; Religion, virtue, reason, common sense, Pronounce your human form a false pretence,— A mere disguise in which a devil lurks, Who yet betrays his secret by his works. Ye powers who rule the tongue, if such there are, And make colloquial happiness your care, Preserve me from the thing I dread and hate,— A duel in the form of a debate: The clash of arguments and jar of words, Worse than the mortal brunt of rival swords, Decide no question with their tedious length, For opposition gives opinion strength, Divert the champions prodigal of breath, And put the peaceably-disposed to death. Oh thwart me not, Sir Soph. at every turn, Nor carp at every flaw you may discern; Though syllogisms hang not on my tongue, I am not surely always in the wrong: 'Tis hard if all is false that I advance, A fool must now and then be right by chance. Not that all freedom of dissent I blame; No,—there I grant the privilege I claim. A disputable point is no man's ground, Rove where you please, 'tis common all around; Discourse may want an animated No, To brush the surface, and to make it flow; But still remember, if you mean to please, To press your point with modesty and ease. The mark at which my juster aim I take, Is contradiction for its own dear sake: Set your opinion at whatever pitch, Knots and impediments make something hitch; Adopt his own, 'tis equally in vain, Your thread of argument is snapt again; The wrangler, rather than accord with you, Will judge himself deceived,—and prove it too. Vociferated logic kills me quite,— A noisy man is always in the right; I twirl my thumbs, fall back into my chair, Fix on the wainscot a distressful stare, And when I hope his blunders are all out, Reply discreetly—To be sure—no doubt. Dubius is such a scrupulous good man,— Yes, you may catch him tripping if you can. He would not with a peremptory tone Assert the nose upon his face his own; With hesitation admirably slow, He humbly hopes, presumes it may be so. His evidence, if he were called by law To swear to some enormity he saw, For want of prominence and just relief, Would hang an honest man, and save a thief. Through constant dread of giving truth offence, He ties up all his hearers in suspense, Knows what he knows as if he knew it not, What he remembers seems to have forgot, His sole opinion, whatsoe'er befall, Centering at last in having none at all. Yet though he tease and baulk your listening ear, He makes one useful point exceeding clear; Howe'er ingenious on his darling theme A sceptic in philosophy may seem, Reduced to practice, his beloved rule Would only prove him a consummate fool. Useless in him alike both brain and speech, Fate having placed all truth above his reach; His ambiguities his total sum, He might as well be blind and deaf and dumb. Where men of judgement creep and feel their way, The positive pronounce without dismay, Their want of light and intellect supplied By sparks absurdity strikes out of pride: Without the means of knowing right from wrong, They always are decisive, clear, and strong; Where others toil with philosophic force, Their nimble nonsense takes a shorter course, Flings at your head conviction in the lump, And gains remote conclusions at a jump: Their own defect, invisible to them, Seen in another they at once condemn, And though self-idolized in every case, Hate their own likeness in a brother's face. The cause is plain and not to be denied, The proud are always most provoked by pride; Few competitions but engender spite, And those the most where neither has a right. The point of honour has been deem'd of use, To teach good manners and to curb abuse; Admit it true, the consequence is clear, Our polish'd manners are a mask we wear, And at the bottom, barbarous still and rude, We are restrain'd indeed, but not subdued. The very remedy, however sure, Springs from the mischief it intends to cure, And savage in its principle appears, Tried, as it should be, by the fruit it bears. 'Tis hard indeed if nothing will defend Mankind from quarrels but their fatal end, That now and then a hero must decease, That the surviving world may live in peace. Perhaps at last close scrutiny may show The practice dastardly and mean and low, That men engage in it compell'd by force, And fear, not courage, is its proper source, The fear of tyrant custom, and the fear Lest fops should censure us, and fools should sneer. At least to trample on our Maker's laws, And hazard life for any or no cause, To rush into a fixt eternal state Out of the very flames of rage and hate, Or send another shivering to the bar With all the guilt of such unnatural war, Whatever use may urge, or honour plead, On reason's verdict is a madman's deed. Am I to set my life upon a throw Because a bear is rude and surly? No.— A moral, sensible, and well-bred man Will not affront me, and no other can. Were I empower'd to regulate the lists, They should encounter with well-loaded fists; A Trojan combat would be something new, Let Dares beat Entellus black and blue, Then each might show to his admiring friends In honourable bumps his rich amends, And carry in contusions of his scull A satisfactory receipt in full. A story in which native humour reigns Is often useful, always entertains; A graver fact enlisted on your side May furnish illustration, well applied; But sedentary weavers of long tales Give me the fidgets, and my patience fails. 'Tis the most asinine employ on earth, To hear them tell of parentage and birth, And echo conversations dull and dry, Embellish'd with, he said, and so said I. At every interview their route the same, The repetition makes attention lame; We bustle up with unsuccessful speed, And in the saddest part cry,—droll indeed! The path of narrative with care pursue, Still making probability your clue, On all the vestiges of truth attend, And let them guide you to a decent end. Of all ambitions man may entertain, The worst that can invade a sickly brain Is that which angles hourly for surprise, And baits its hook with prodigies and lies. Credulous infancy or age as weak Are fittest auditors for such to seek, Who to please others will themselves disgrace, Yet please not, but affront you to your face. A great retailer of this curious ware, Having unloaded, and made many stare, Can this be true? an arch observer cries,— Yes, rather moved, I saw it with these eyes. Sir! I believe it on that ground alone; I could not had I seen it with my own. A tale should be judicious, clear, succinct, The language plain, and incidents well link'd. Tell not as new what every body knows, And new or old still hasten to a close, There centering in a focus, round and neat, Let all your rays of information meet: What neither yields us profit or delight, Is like a nurse's lullaby at night; Guy Earl of Warwick and fair Eleanore, Or giant-killing Jack would please me more. The pipe with solemn interposing puff Makes half a sentence at a time enough; The dozing sages drop the drowsy strain, Then pause, and puff,—and speak, and pause again. Such often like the tube they so admire, Important triflers! have more smoke than fire. Pernicious weed! whose scent the fair annoys, Unfriendly to society's chief joys, Thy worst effect is banishing for hours The sex whose presence civilizes ours. Thou art indeed the drug a gardener wants To poison vermin that infest his plants; But are we so to wit and beauty blind As to despise the glory of our kind, And show the softest minds and fairest forms As little mercy as he grubs and worms? They dare not wait the riotous abuse Thy thirst-creating steams at length produce, When wine has given indecent language birth, And forced the flood-gates of licentious mirth; For sea-born Venus her attachment shows Still to that element from which she rose, And with a quiet which no fumes disturb, Sips meek infusions of a milder herb. The emphatic speaker dearly loves to oppose In contact inconvenient, nose to nose, As if the gnomon on his neighbour's phiz, Touch'd with a magnet had attracted his. His whisper'd theme, dilated and at large, Proves after all a wind-gun's airy charge,— An extract of his diary,—no more,— A tasteless journal of the day before. He walk'd abroad, o'ertaken in the rain, Call'd on a friend, drank tea, stept home again; Resumed his purpose, had a world of talk With one he stumbled on, and lost his walk. I interrupt him with a sudden bow, Adieu, dear Sir! lest you should lose it now. I cannot talk with civet in the room, A fine puss-gentleman that's all perfume; The sight's enough,—no need to smell a beau,— Who thrusts his nose into a raree-show? His odoriferous attempts to please Perhaps might prosper with a swarm of bees, But we that make no honey though we sting, Poets, are sometimes apt to maul the thing. 'Tis wrong to bring into a mix'd resort, What makes some sick, and others à-la-mort, An argument of cogence, we may say, Why such a one should keep himself away. A graver coxcomb we may sometimes see Quite as absurd, though not so light as he: A shallow brain behind a serious mask, An oracle within an empty cask, The solemn fop; significant and budge; A fool with judges, amongst fools a judge; He says but little, and that little said Owes all its weight, like loaded dice, to lead. His wit invites you by his looks to come, But when you knock it never is at home: 'Tis like a parcel sent you by the stage, Some handsome present, as your hopes presage, 'Tis heavy, bulky, and bids fair to prove An absent friend's fidelity and love; But when unpack'd your disappointment groans To find it stuff'd with brickbats, earth, and stones. Some men employ their health, an ugly trick, In making known how oft they have been sick, And give us in recitals of disease A doctor's trouble, but without the fees: Relate how many weeks they kept their bed, How an emetic or cathartic sped; Nothing is slightly touch'd, much less forgot, Nose, ears, and eyes, seem present on the spot. Now the distemper, spite of draught or pill, Victorious seem'd, and now the doctor's skill; And now—alas for unforeseen mishaps! They put on a damp nightcap and relapse; They thought they must have died, they were so bad; Their peevish hearers almost wish they had. Some fretful tempers wince at every touch, You always do too little or too much: You speak with life in hopes to entertain, Your elevated voice goes through the brain; You fall at once into a lower key, That's worse,—the dronepipe of an humble-bee. The southern sash admits too strong a light, You rise and drop the curtain,—now 'tis night. He shakes with cold,—you stir the fire and strive To make a blaze,—that's roasting him alive. Serve him with venison, and he chooses fish; With sole,—that's just the sort he would not wish. He takes what he at first profess'd to loathe, And in due time feeds heartily on both; Yet still, o'erclouded with a constant frown, He does not swallow, but he gulps it down. Your hope to please him vain on every plan, Himself should work that wonder, if he can.— Alas! his efforts double his distress, He likes yours little, and his own still less; Thus always teasing others, always teased, His only pleasure is—to be displeased. I pity bashful men, who feel the pain Of fancied scorn and undeserved disdain, And bear the marks upon a blushing face Of needless shame and self-imposed disgrace. Our sensibilities are so acute, The fear of being silent makes us mute. We sometimes think we could a speech produce Much to the purpose, if our tongues were loose, But, being tied, it dies upon the lip, Faint as a chicken's note that has the pip: Our wasted oil unprofitably burns, Like hidden lamps in old sepulchral urns. Few Frenchmen of this evil have complain'd; It seems as if we Britons were ordain'd, By way of wholesome curb upon our pride, To fear each other, fearing none beside. The cause perhaps inquiry may descry, Self-searching with an introverted eye, Conceal'd within an unsuspected part, The vainest corner of our own vain heart: For ever aiming at the world's esteem, Our self-importance ruins its own scheme; In other eyes our talents rarely shown, Become at length so splendid in our own, We dare not risk them into public view, Lest they miscarry of what seems their due. True modesty is a discerning grace, And only blushes in the proper place; But counterfeit is blind, and skulks through fear, Where 'tis a shame to be ashamed to appear: Humility the parent of the first, The last by Vanity produced and nursed. The circle form'd, we sit in silent state, Like figures drawn upon a dial-plate; Yes, Ma'am, and no, Ma'am, utter'd softly, show Every five minutes how the minutes go; Each individual suffering a constraint, Poetry may, but colours cannot paint, As if in close committee on the sky, Reports it hot or cold, or wet or dry, And finds a changing clime a happy source Of wise reflection and well timed discourse. We next inquire, but softly and by stealth, Like conservators of the public health, Of epidemic throats, if such there are, And coughs and rheums, and phthisic and catarrh. That theme exhausted, a wide chasm ensues, Fill'd up at last with interesting news, Who danced with whom, and who are like to wed, And who is hang'd, and who is brought to bed; But fear to call a more important cause, As if 'twere treason against English laws. The visit paid, with ecstasy we come, As from a seven years' transportation, home, And there resume an unembarrass'd brow, Recovering what we lost we know not how, The faculties that seem'd reduced to nought, Expression and the privilege of thought. The reeking, roaring hero of the chase, I give him over as a desperate case. Physicians write in hopes to work a cure, Never, if honest ones, when death is sure; And though the fox he follows may be tamed, A mere fox-follower never is reclaim'd. Some farrier should prescribe his proper course, Whose only fit companion is his horse, Or if deserving of a better doom, The noble beast judge otherwise, his groom. Yet even the rogue that serves him, though he stand To take his honour's orders cap in hand, Prefers his fellow grooms, with much good sense, Their skill a truth, his master's a pretence. If neither horse nor groom affect the squire, Where can at last his jockeyship retire? Oh, to the club, the scene of savage joys, The school of coarse good fellowship and noise; There, in the sweet society of those Whose friendship from his boyish years he chose, Let him improve his talent if he can, Till none but beasts acknowledge him a man. Man's heart had been impenetrably seal'd Like theirs that cleave the flood or graze the field, Had not his Maker's all-bestowing hand Given him a soul, and bade him understand. The reasoning power vouchsafed of course inferr'd The power to clothe that reason with his word; For all is perfect that God works on earth, And He that gives conception adds the birth. If this be plain, 'tis plainly understood What uses of his boon the giver would. The mind despatch'd upon her busy toil, Should range where Providence has bless'd the soil; Visiting every flower with labour meet, And gathering all her treasures sweet by sweet, She should imbue the tongue with what she sips, And shed the balmy blessing on the lips, That good diffused may more abundant grow, And speech may praise the power that bids it flow. Will the sweet warbler of the livelong night That fills the listening lover with delight, Forget his harmony, with rapture heard, To learn the twittering of a meaner bird? Or make the parrot's mimicry his choice, That odious libel on a human voice? No,—Nature, unsophisticate by man, Starts not aside from her Creator's plan; The melody that was at first design'd To cheer the rude forefathers of mankind, Is note for note deliver'd in our ears, In the last scene of her six thousand years: Yet Fashion, leader of a chattering train, Whom man for his own hurt permits to reign, Who shifts and changes all things but his shape, And would degrade her votary to an ape, The fruitful parent of abuse and wrong Holds a usurp'd dominion o'er his tongue; There sits and prompts him with his own disgrace, Prescribes the theme, the tone, and the grimace, And when accomplish'd in her wayward school, Calls gentleman whom she has made a fool. 'Tis an unalterable fix'd decree, That none could frame or ratify but she, That heaven and hell, and righteousness and sin, Snares in his path, and foes that lurk within, God and his attributes, (a field of day Where 'tis an angel's happiness to stray,) Fruits of his love, and wonders of his might, Be never named in ears esteem'd polite: That he who dares, when she forbids, be grave, Shall stand proscribed a madman or a knave, A close designer not to be believed, Or, if excused that charge, at least deceived. Oh folly worthy of the nurse's lap, Give it the breast, or stop its mouth with pap! Is it incredible, or can it seem A dream to any, except those that dream, That man should love his Maker, and that fire, Warming his heart, should at his lips transpire? Know then, and modestly let fall your eyes, And veil your daring crest that braves the skies, That air of insolence affronts your God, You need his pardon, and provoke his rod: Now, in a posture that becomes you more Than that heroic strut assumed before, Know, your arrears with every hour accrue For mercy shown, while wrath is justly due. The time is short, and there are souls on earth, Though future pain may serve for present mirth, Acquainted with the woes that fear or shame, By fashion taught, forbade them once to name, And having felt the pangs you deem a jest, Have proved them truths too big to be express'd. Go seek on Revelation's hallow'd ground, Sure to succeed, the remedy they found: Touch'd by that power that you have dared to mock, That makes seas stable, and dissolves the rock, Your heart shall yield a life-renewing stream, That fools, as you have done, shall call a dream. It happen'd on a solemn eventide, Soon after He that was our surety died, Two bosom friends, each pensively inclined, The scene of all those sorrows left behind, Sought their own village, busied as they went In musings worthy of the great event: They spake of him they loved, of him whose life, Though blameless, had incurr'd perpetual strife, Whose deeds had left, in spite of hostile arts, A deep memorial graven on their hearts. The recollection, like a vein of ore, The farther traced enrich'd them still the more; They thought him, and they justly thought him, one Sent to do more than he appear'd to have done, To exalt a people, and to place them high Above all else, and wonder'd he should die. Ere yet they brought their journey to an end, A stranger join'd them, courteous as a friend, And ask'd them with a kind engaging air What their affliction was, and begg'd a share. Inform'd, he gather'd up the broken thread, And truth and wisdom gracing all he said, Explain'd, illustrated, and search'd so well The tender theme on which they chose to dwell, That reaching home, the night, they said, is near, We must not now be parted, sojourn here.— The new acquaintance soon became a guest, And made so welcome at their simple feast, He bless'd the bread, but vanish'd at the word, And left them both exclaiming, 'Twas the Lord! Did not our hearts feel all he deign'd to say, Did they not burn within us by the way? Now theirs was converse such as it behoves Man to maintain, and such as God approves: Their views indeed were indistinct and dim, But yet successful, being aim'd at him. Christ and his character their only scope, Their object and their subject and their hope, They felt what it became them much to feel, And, wanting him to loose the sacred seal, Found him as prompt as their desire was true, To spread the newborn glories in their view. Well,—what are ages and the lapse of time Match'd against truths as lasting as sublime? Can length of years on God himself exact, Or make that fiction which was once a fact? No,—marble and recording brass decay, And like the graver's memory pass away; The works of man inherit, as is just, Their author's frailty, and return to dust; But truth divine for ever stands secure, Its head as guarded as its base is sure; Fix'd in the rolling flood of endless years The pillar of the eternal plan appears, The raving storm and dashing wave defies, Built by that Architect who built the skies. Hearts may be found that harbour at this hour That love of Christ in all its quickening power, And lips unstain'd by folly or by strife, Whose wisdom, drawn from the deep well of life, Tastes of its healthful origin, and flows A Jordan for the ablution of our woes. Oh days of heaven and nights of equal praise, Serene and peaceful as those heavenly days, When souls drawn upward in communion sweet, Enjoy the stillness of some close retreat, Discourse as if released and safe at home, Of dangers past and wonders yet to come, And spread the sacred treasures of the breast Upon the lap of covenanted rest. What, always dreaming over heavenly things, Like angel-heads in stone with pigeon-wings? Canting and whining out all day the word, And half the night? fanatic and absurd! Mine be the friend less frequent in his prayers, Who makes no bustle with his soul's affairs, Whose wit can brighten up a wintry day, And chase the splenetic dull hours away, Content on earth in earthly things to shine, Who waits for heaven ere he becomes divine, Leaves saints to enjoy those altitudes they teach, And plucks the fruit placed more within his reach. Well spoken, Advocate of sin and shame, Known by thy bleating, Ignorance thy name. Is sparkling wit the world's exclusive right, The fix'd fee simple of the vain and light? Can hopes of heaven, bright prospects of an hour That comes to waft us out of sorrow's power, Obscure or quench a faculty that finds Its happiest soil in the serenest minds? Religion curbs indeed its wanton play, And brings the trifler under rigorous sway, But gives it usefulness unknown before, And purifying, makes it shine the more. A Christian's wit is inoffensive light, A beam that aids but never grieves the sight, Vigorous in age as in the flush of youth, 'Tis always active on the side of truth; Temperance and peace insure its healthful state, And make it brightest at its latest date. Oh I have seen (nor hope perhaps in vain, Ere life go down, to see such sights again,) A veteran warrior in the Christian field, Who never saw the sword he could not wield; Grave without dulness, learned without pride, Exact yet not precise, though meek keen-eyed; A man that would have foil'd at their own play A dozen would-be's of the modern day; Who when occasion justified its use, Had wit as bright as ready to produce, Could fetch from records of an earlier age, Or from philosophy's enlighten'd page, His rich materials, and regale your ear With strains it was a privilege to hear; Yet above all his luxury supreme, And his chief glory, was the gospel theme; There he was copious as old Greece or Rome, His happy eloquence seem'd there at home, Ambitious not to shine or to excel, But to treat justly what he loved so well. It moves me more perhaps than folly ought, When some green heads as void of wit as thought, Suppose themselves monopolists of sense, And wiser men's ability pretence. Though time will wear us, and we must grow old, Such men are not forgot as soon as cold, Their fragrant memory will outlast their tomb, Embalm'd for ever in its own perfume. And to say truth, though in its early prime, And when unstain'd with any grosser crime, Youth has a sprightliness and fire to boast, That in the valley of decline are lost, And Virtue with peculiar charms appears Crown'd with the garland of life's blooming years; Yet age, by long experience well inform'd, Well read, well temper'd, with religion warm'd, That fire abated which impels rash youth, Proud of his speed, to overshoot the truth, As time improves the grape's authentic juice, Mellows and makes the speech more fit for use, And claims a reverence in its shortening day, That 'tis an honour and a joy to pay. The fruits of age, less fair, are yet more sound Than those a brighter season pours around, And like the stores autumnal suns mature, Through wintry rigours unimpair'd endure. What is fanatic frenzy, scorn'd so much, And dreaded more than a contagious touch? I grant it dangerous, and approve your fear; That fire is catching if you draw too near; But sage observers oft mistake the flame, And give true piety that odious name. To tremble (as the creature of an hour Ought at the view of an Almighty power) Before His presence, at whose aweful throne All tremble in all worlds, except our own; To supplicate his mercy, love his ways, And prize them above pleasure, wealth, or praise, Though common sense allow'd a casting voice, And free from bias, must approve the choice, Convicts a man fanatic in the extreme, And wild as madness in the world's esteem. But that disease, when soberly defined, Is the false fire of an o'erheated mind; It views the truth with a distorted eye, And either warps or lays it useless by: 'Tis narrow, selfish, arrogant, and draws Its sordid nourishment from man's applause, And while at heart sin unrelinquish'd lies, Presumes itself chief favourite of the skies. 'Tis such a light as putrefaction breeds In fly-blown flesh, whereon the maggot feeds, Shines in the dark, but usher'd into day, The stench remains, the lustre dies away. True bliss, if man may reach it, is composed Of hearts in union mutually disclosed; And, farewell else all hope of pure delight, Those hearts should be reclaim'd, renew'd, upright. Bad men, profaning friendship's hallow'd name, Form, in its stead, a covenant of shame, A dark confederacy against the laws Of virtue, and religion's glorious cause: They build each other up with dreadful skill, As bastions set point blank against God's will, Enlarge and fortify the dread redoubt, Deeply resolved to shut a Saviour out,— Call legions up from hell to back the deed, And curst with conquest, finally succeed: But souls that carry on a blest exchange Of joys they meet with in their heavenly range, And with a fearless confidence make known The sorrows sympathy esteems its own, Daily derive increasing light and force From such communion in their pleasant course, Feel less the journey's roughness and its length, Meet their opposers with united strength, And one in heart, in interest, and design, Gird up each other to the race divine. But Conversation, choose what theme we may, And chiefly when religion leads the way, Should flow like waters after summer showers, Not as if raised by mere mechanic powers. The Christian in whose soul, though now distress'd, Lives the dear thought of joys he once possess'd, When all his glowing language issued forth With God's deep stamp upon its current worth, Will speak without disguise, and must impart, Sad as it is, his undissembling heart, Abhors constraint, and dares not feign a zeal, Or seem to boast a fire he does not feel. The song of Sion is a tasteless thing, Unless, when rising on a joyful wing, The soul can mix with the celestial bands, And give the strain the compass it demands. Strange tidings these to tell a world who treat All but their own experience as deceit! Will they believe, though credulous enough To swallow much upon much weaker proof, That there are blest inhabitants of earth, Partakers of a new ethereal birth, Their hopes, desires, and purposes estranged From things terrestrial, and divinely changed, Their very language of a kind that speaks The soul's sure interest in the good she seeks, Who deal with Scripture, its importance felt, As Tully with philosophy once dealt, And in the silent watches of the night, And through the scenes of toil-renewing light, The social walk, or solitary ride, Keep still the dear companion at their side? No,—shame upon a self-disgracing age, God's work may serve an ape upon a stage With such a jest as fill'd with hellish glee Certain invisibles as shrewd as he; But veneration or respect finds none, Save from the subjects of that work alone. The world grown old, her deep discernment shows, Claps spectacles on her sagacious nose, Peruses closely the true Christian's face, And finds it a mere mask of sly grimace, Usurps God's office, lays his bosom bare, And finds hypocrisy close-lurking there, And serving God herself through mere constraint, Concludes his unfeign'd love of him, a feint. And yet, God knows, look human nature through, (And in due time the world shall know it too,) That since the flowers of Eden felt the blast, That after man's defection laid all waste, Sincerity towards the heart-searching God Has made the new-born creature her abode, Nor shall be found in unregenerate souls, Till the last fire burn all between the poles. Sincerity! Why 'tis his only pride; Weak and imperfect in all grace beside, He knows that God demands his heart entire, And gives him all his just demands require. Without it, his pretensions were as vain, As, having it, he deems the world's disdain; That great defect would cost him not alone Man's favourable judgement, but his own, His birthright shaken, and no longer clear, Than while his conduct proves his heart sincere. Retort the charge, and let the world be told She boasts a confidence she does not hold; That, conscious of her crimes, she feels instead A cold misgiving, and a killing dread; That while in health, the ground of her support Is madly to forget that life is short; That sick, she trembles, knowing she must die, Her hope presumption, and her faith a lie. That while she dotes, and dreams that she believes, She mocks her Maker, and herself deceives; Her utmost reach, historical assent, The doctrines warp'd to what they never meant; That truth itself is in her head as dull And useless as a candle in a skull, And all her love of God a groundless claim, A trick upon the canvass, painted flame. Tell her again, the sneer upon her face, And all her censures of the work of grace, Are insincere, meant only to conceal A dread she would not, yet is forced to feel; That in her heart the Christian she reveres, And while she seems to scorn him, only fears. A poet does not work by square or line, As smiths and joiners perfect a design; At least we moderns, our attention less, Beyond the example of our sires digress, And claim a right to scamper and run wide, Wherever chance, caprice, or fancy guide. The world and I fortuitously met, I owed a trifle and have paid the debt; She did me wrong, I recompensed the deed, And, having struck the balance, now proceed. Perhaps, however, as some years have pass'd Since she and I conversed together last, And I have lived recluse in rural shades, Which seldom a distinct report pervades, Great changes and new manners have occurr'd, And blest reforms that I have never heard, And she may now be as discreet and wise, As once absurd in all discerning eyes. Sobriety perhaps may now be found, Where once intoxication press'd the ground; The subtle and injurious may be just, And he grown chaste that was the slave of lust; Arts once esteem'd may be with shame dismiss'd, Charity may relax the miser's fist, The gamester may have cast his cards away, Forgot to curse, and only kneel to pray. It has indeed been told me (with what weight, How credibly, 'tis hard for me to state,) That fables old, that seem'd for ever mute, Revived, are hastening into fresh repute, And gods and goddesses discarded long, Like useless lumber or a stroller's song, Are bringing into vogue their heathen train, And Jupiter bids fair to rule again; That certain feasts are instituted now, Where Venus hears the lover's tender vow; That all Olympus through the country roves, To consecrate our few remaining groves, And echo learns politely to repeat The praise of names for ages obsolete: That having proved the weakness, it should seem, Of revelation's ineffectual beam, To bring the passions under sober sway, And give the moral springs their proper play, They mean to try what may at last be done By stout substantial gods of wood and stone, And whether Roman rites may not produce The virtues of old Rome for English use. May much success attend the pious plan, May Mercury once more embellish man, Grace him again with long forgotten arts, Reclaim his taste and brighten up his parts, Make him athletic as in days of old, Learn'd at the bar, in the palæstra bold, Divest the rougher sex of female airs, And teach the softer not to copy theirs. The change shall please, nor shall it matter aught Who works the wonder, if it be but wrought. 'Tis time, however, if the case stand thus, For us plain folks and all who side with us, To build our altar, confident and bold, And say as stern Elijah said of old, The strife now stands upon a fair award, If Israel's Lord be God, then serve the Lord,— If he be silent, faith is all a whim, Then Baal is the God, and worship him! Digression is so much in modern use, Thought is so rare, and fancy so profuse, Some never seem so wide of their intent, As when returning to the theme they meant; As mendicants, whose business is to roam, Make every parish but their own their home: Though such continual zigzags in a book, Such drunken reelings have an awkward look, And I had rather creep to what is true Than rove and stagger with no mark in view; Yet to consult a little seem'd no crime, The freakish humour of the present time. But now, to gather up what seems dispersed, And touch the subject I design'd at first, May prove, though much beside the rules of art, Best for the public, and my wisest part. And first let no man charge me that I mean To clothe in sables every social scene, And give good company a face severe, As if they met around a father's bier; For tell some men, that pleasure all their bent, And laughter all their work, is life mispent, Their wisdom bursts into this sage reply, Then mirth is sin, and we should always cry. To find the medium asks some share of wit, And therefore 'tis a mark fools never hit. But though life's valley be a vale of tears, A brighter scene beyond that vale appears, Whose glory with a light that never fades, Shoots between scatter'd rocks and opening shades, And while it shows the land the soul desires, The language of the land she seeks, inspires. Thus touch'd, the tongue receives a sacred cure Of all that was absurd, profane, impure; Held within modest bounds, the tide of speech Pursues the course that truth and nature teach, No longer labours merely to produce The pomp of sound, or tinkle without use: Where'er it winds, the salutary stream, Sprightly and fresh, enriches every theme, While all the happy man possess'd before, The gift of nature or the classic store, Is made subservient to the grand design For which Heaven form'd the faculty divine. So should an idiot, while at large he strays, Find the sweet lyre on which an artist plays, With rash and awkward force the chords he shakes, And grins with wonder at the jar he makes; But let the wise and well-instructed hand Once take the shell beneath his just command, In gentle sounds it seems as it complained Of the rude injuries it late sustained, Till tuned at length to some immortal song, It sounds Jehovah's name, and pours his praise along. RETIREMENT. ? studiis fiorens ignobilis otí. Virg. Georg. lib. 4. Hackney'd in business, wearied at the oar Which thousands, once fast chain'd to, quit no more, But which when life at ebb runs weak and low, All wish, or seem to wish they could forego, The statesman, lawyer, merchant, man of trade, Pants for the refuge of some rural shade, Where all his long anxieties forgot Amid the charms of a sequester'd spot, Or recollected only to gild o'er And add a smile to what was sweet before, He may possess the joys he thinks he sees, Lay his old age upon the lap of ease, Improve the remnant of his wasted span, And having lived a trifler, die a man. Thus conscience pleads her cause within the breast, Though long rebell'd against, not yet suppress'd, And calls a creature form'd for God alone, For Heaven's high purposes and not his own, Calls him away from selfish ends and aims, From what debilitates and what inflames, From cities humming with a restless crowd, Sordid as active, ignorant as loud, Whose highest praise is that they live in vain, The dupes of pleasure, or the slaves of gain, Where works of man are cluster'd close around, And works of God are hardly to be found, To regions where in spite of sin and woe, Traces of Eden are still seen below, Where mountain, river, forest, field and grove Remind him of his Maker's power and love. 'Tis well if look'd for at so late a day, In the last scene of such a senseless play, True wisdom will attend his feeble call, And grace his action ere the curtain fall. Souls that have long despised their heavenly birth, Their wishes all impregnated with earth, For threescore years employed with ceaseless care In catching smoke and feeding upon air, Conversant only with the ways of men, Rarely redeem the short remaining ten. Inveterate habits choke the unfruitful heart, Their fibres penetrate its tenderest part, And draining its nutritious powers to feed Their noxious growth, starve every better seed. Happy if full of days,—but happier far If ere we yet discern life's evening star, Sick of the service of a world that feeds Its patient drudges with dry chaff and weeds, We can escape from custom's idiot sway, To serve the Sovereign we were born to obey. Then sweet to muse upon his skill display'd (Infinite skill) in all that he has made! To trace in Nature's most minute design, The signature and stamp of power divine, Contrivance intricate express'd with ease, Where unassisted sight no beauty sees, The shapely limb and lubricated joint, Within the small dimensions of a point, Muscle and nerve miraculously spun, His mighty work who speaks and it is done, The invisible in things scarce seen reveal'd, To whom an atom is an ample field. To wonder at a thousand insect forms, These hatch'd, and those resuscitated worms, New life ordain'd and brighter scenes to share, Once prone on earth, now buoyant upon air, Whose shape would make them, had they bulk and size, More hideous foes than fancy can devise; With helmed heads and dragon scales adorn'd, The mighty myriads, now securely scorn'd, Would mock the majesty of man's high birth, Despise his bulwarks and unpeople earth. Then with a glance of fancy to survey, Far as the faculty can stretch away, Ten thousand rivers poured at his command From urns that never fail through every land, These like a deluge with impetuous force, Those winding modestly a silent course, The cloud-surmounting alps, the fruitful vales, Seas on which every nation spreads her sails, The sun, a world whence other worlds drink light, The crescent moon, the diadem of night, Stars countless, each in his appointed place, Fast anchor'd in the deep abyss of space,— At such a sight to catch the poet's flame, And with a rapture like his own exclaim, These are thy glorious works, thou Source of good, How dimly seen, how faintly understood! Thine, and upheld by thy paternal care, This universal frame, thus wondrous fair; Thy power divine and bounty beyond thought, Adored and praised in all that thou hast wrought, Absorbed in that immensity I see, I shrink abased, and yet aspire to thee; Instruct me, guide me to that heavenly day, Thy words, more clearly than thy works display, That while thy truths my grosser thoughts refine, I may resemble thee and call thee mine. O blest proficiency! surpassing all That men erroneously their glory call, The recompense that arts or arms can yield, The bar, the senate, or the tented field. Compared with this sublimest life below, Ye kings and rulers, what have courts to show? Thus studied, used and consecrated thus, Whatever is, seems form'd indeed for us, Not as the plaything of a froward child, Fretful unless diverted and beguiled, Much less to feed and fan the fatal fires Of pride, ambition, or impure desires; But as a scale by which the soul ascends From mighty means to more important ends, Securely, though by steps but rarely trod, Mounts from inferior beings up to God, And sees by no fallacious light or dim, Earth made for man, and man himself for Him. Not that I mean to approve, or would enforce A superstitious and monastic course: Truth is not local; God alike pervades And fills the world of traffic and the shades, And may be fear'd amid the busiest scenes, Or scorn'd where business never intervenes. But 'tis not easy with a mind like ours, Conscious of weakness in its noblest powers, And in a world where (other ills apart) The roving eye misleads the careless heart, To limit thought, by nature prone to stray Wherever freakish fancy points the way; To bid the pleadings of self-love be still, Resign our own and seek our Maker's will; To spread the page of Scripture, and compare Our conduct with the laws engraven there; To measure all that passes in the breast, Faithfully, fairly, by that sacred test, To dive into the secret deeps within, To spare no passion and no favourite sin, And search the themes important above all, Ourselves and our recovery from our fall. But leisure, silence, and a mind released From anxious thoughts how wealth may be increased, How to secure in some propitious hour, The point of interest or the post of power; A soul serene, and equally retired From objects too much dreaded or desired, Safe from the clamours of perverse dispute, At least are friendly to the great pursuit. Opening the map of God's extensive plan, We find a little isle, this life of man; Eternity's unknown expanse appears Circling around and limiting his years; The busy race examine and explore Each creek and cavern of the dangerous shore, With care collect what in their eyes excels, Some shining pebbles, and some weeds and shells, Thus laden, dream that they are rich and great, And happiest he that groans beneath his weight; The waves o'ertake them in their serious play, And every hour sweep multitudes away; They shriek and sink, survivors start and weep, Pursue their sport, and follow to the deep. A few forsake the throng, with lifted eyes Ask wealth of Heaven, and gain a real prize, Truth, wisdom, grace, and peace like that above, Seal'd with his signet whom they serve and love; Scorn'd by the rest, with patient hope they wait A kind release from their imperfect state, And unregretted are soon snatch'd away From scenes of sorrow into glorious day. Nor these alone prefer a life recluse, Who seek retirement for its proper use; The love of change that lives in every breast, Genius, and temper, and desire of rest, Discordant motives in one centre meet, And each inclines its votary to retreat. Some minds by nature are averse to noise, And hate the tumult half the world enjoys, The lure of avarice, or the pompous prize That courts display before ambitious eyes, The fruits that hang on pleasure's flowery stem, Whate'er enchants them are no snares to them. To them the deep recess of dusky groves, Or forest where the deer securely roves, The fall of waters and the song of birds, And hills that echo to the distant herds, Are luxuries excelling all the glare The world can boast, and her chief favourites share. With eager step and carelessly array'd, For such a cause the poet seeks the shade, From all he sees he catches new delight, Pleased fancy claps her pinions at the sight, The rising or the setting orb of day, The clouds that flit or slowly float away, Nature in all the various shapes she wears, Frowning in storms or breathing gentle airs, The snowy robe her wintry state assumes, Her summer heats, her fruits, and her perfumes, All, all alike transport the glowing bard, Success in rhyme his glory and reward. O Nature! whose Elysian scenes disclose His bright perfections at whose word they rose, Next to that Power who form'd thee and sustains, Be thou the great inspirer of my strains. Still as I touch the lyre, do thou expand Thy genuine charms, and guide an artless hand, That I may catch a fire but rarely known, Give useful light though I should miss renown, And poring on thy page, whose every line Bears proofs of an intelligence divine, May feel a heart enrich'd by what it pays, That builds its glory on its Maker's praise. Woe to the man whose wit disclaims its use, Glittering in vain, or only to seduce, Who studies nature with a wanton eye, Admires the work, but slips the lesson by,— His hours of leisure and recess employs, In drawing pictures of forbidden joys, Retires to blazon his own worthless name, Or shoot the careless with a surer aim. The lover too shuns business and alarms, Tender idolator of absent charms. Saints offer nothing in their warmest prayers, That he devotes not with a zeal like theirs; 'Tis consecration of his heart, soul, time, And every thought that wanders is a crime. In sighs he worships his supremely fair, And weeps a sad libation in despair, Adores a creature, and devout in vain, Wins in return an answer of disdain. As woodbine weds the plants within her reach, Rough elm, or smooth-grain'd ash, or glossy beech, In spiral rings ascends the trunk, and lays Her golden tassels on the leafy sprays, But does a mischief while she lends a grace, Straitening its growth by such a strict embrace, So love that clings around the noblest minds, Forbids the advancement of the soul he binds; The suitor's air indeed he soon improves, And forms it to the taste of her he loves, Teaches his eyes a language, and no less Refines his speech and fashions his address; But farewell promises of happier fruits, Manly designs, and learning's grave pursuits; Girt with a chain he cannot wish to break, His only bliss is sorrow for her sake, Who will may pant for glory and excel, Her smile his aim, all higher aims farewell! Thyrsis, Alexis, or whatever name May least offend against so pure a flame, Though sage advice of friends the most sincere Sounds harshly in so delicate an ear, And lovers, of all creatures tame or wild, Can least brook management, however mild, Yet let a poet (poetry disarms The fiercest animals with magic charms) Risk an intrusion on thy pensive mood, And woo and win thee to thy proper good. Pastoral images and still retreats, Umbrageous walks and solitary seats, Sweet birds in concert with harmonious streams, Soft airs, nocturnal vigils, and day dreams, Are all enchantments in a case like thine, Conspire against thy peace with one design, Sooth thee to make thee but a surer prey, And feed the fire that wastes thy powers away. Up!—God has formed thee with a wiser view, Not to be led in chains, but to subdue, Calls thee to cope with enemies, and first Points out a conflict with thyself, the worst. Woman indeed, a gift he would bestow When he design'd a paradise below, The richest earthly boon his hands afford, Deserves to be beloved, but not adored. Post away swiftly to more active scenes, Collect the scatter'd truths that study gleans, Mix with the world, but with its wiser part, No longer give an image all thine heart; Its empire is not hers, nor is it thine, 'Tis God's just claim, prerogative divine. Virtuous and faithful Heberden, whose skill Attempts no task it cannot well fulfil, Gives melancholy up to Nature's care, And sends the patient into purer air. Look where he comes,—in this embower'd alcove, Stand close conceal'd, and see a statue move: Lips busy, and eyes fix'd, foot falling slow, Arms hanging idly down, hands clasp'd below, Interpret to the marking eye distress, Such as its symptoms can alone express. That tongue is silent now,—that silent tongue Could argue once, could jest or join the song, Could give advice, could censure or commend, Or charm the sorrows of a drooping friend. Renounced alike its office and its sport, Its brisker and its graver strains fall short, Both fail beneath a fever's secret sway, And like a summer brook are past away. This is a sight for pity to peruse Till she resemble faintly what she views, Till sympathy contract a kindred pain, Pierced with the woes that she laments in vain. This of all maladies that man infest, Claims most compassion and receives the least; Job felt it when he groan'd beneath the rod, And the barb'd arrows of a frowning God, And such emollients as his friends could spare, Friends such as his for modern Jobs prepare. Blest (rather curst) with hearts that never feel, Kept snug in caskets of close-hammer'd steel, With mouths made only to grin wide and eat, And minds that deem derided pain a treat; With limbs of British oak and nerves of wire, And wit that puppet-prompters might inspire, Their sovereign nostrum is a clumsy joke, On pangs enforced with God's severest stroke. But with a soul that ever felt the sting Of sorrow, sorrow is a sacred thing: Not to molest, or irritate, or raise A laugh at its expense, is slender praise; He that has not usurp'd the name of man, Does all, and deems too little, all he can, To assuage the throbbings of the fester'd part, And stanch the bleedings of a broken heart. 'Tis not, as heads that never ache suppose, Forgery of fancy and a dream of woes; Man is a harp whose chords elude the sight, Each yielding harmony, disposed aright, The screws reversed, (a task which if he please God in a moment executes with ease,) Ten thousand thousand strings at once go loose, Lost, till he tune them, all their power and use. Then neither heathy wilds, nor scenes as fair As ever recompensed the peasant's care, Nor soft declivities with tufted hills, Nor view of waters turning busy mills, Parks in which art preceptress nature weds, Nor gardens interspersed with flowery beds, Nor gales that catch the scent of blooming groves, And waft it to the mourner as he roves, Can call up life into his faded eye, That passes all he sees unheeded by: No wounds like those a wounded spirit feels, No cure for such, till God who makes them heals. And thou sad sufferer under nameless ill, That yields not to the touch of human skill, Improve the kind occasion, understand A father's frown, and kiss his chastening hand: To thee the day-spring and the blaze of noon, The purple evening and resplendent moon, The stars, that sprinkled o'er the vault of night Seem drops descending in a shower of light, Shine not, or undesired and hated shine, Seen through the medium of a cloud like thine; Yet seek Him, in his favour life is found, All bliss beside, a shadow or a sound: Then Heaven eclipsed so long, and this dull earth Shall seem to start into a second birth; Nature assuming a more lovely face, Borrowing a beauty from the works of grace, Shall be despised and overlook'd no more, Shall fill thee with delights unfelt before, Impart to things inanimate a voice, And bid her mountains and her hills rejoice; The sound shall run along the winding vales, And thou enjoy an Eden ere it fails. Ye groves, (the statesman at his desk exclaims, Sick of a thousand disappointed aims,) My patrimonial treasure and my pride, Beneath your shades your grey possessor hide! Receive me languishing for that repose The servant of the public never knows. Ye saw me once, (ah those regretted days When boyish innocence was all my praise,) Hour after hour delightfully allot To studies then familiar, since forgot, And cultivate a taste for ancient song, Catching its ardour as I mused along; Nor seldom, as propitious Heaven might send, What once I valued and could boast, a friend, Were witnesses how cordially I press'd His undissembling virtue to my breast; Receive me now, not uncorrupt as then, Nor guiltless of corrupting other men, But versed in arts that while they seem to stay A fallen empire, hasten its decay. To the fair haven of my native home, The wreck of what I was, fatigued I come; For once I can approve the patriot's voice, And make the course he recommends my choice; We meet at last in one sincere desire,— His wish and mine both prompt me to retire. 'Tis done;—he steps into the welcome chaise, Lolls at his ease behind four handsome bays, That whirl away from business and debate The disencumber'd Atlas of the state. Ask not the boy, who when the breeze of morn First shakes the glittering drops from every thorn, Unfolds his flock, then under bank or bush Sits linking cherry-stones or platting rush, How fair is freedom?—he was always free: To carve his rustic name upon a tree, To snare the mole, or with ill-fashion'd hook To draw the incautious minnow from the brook, Are life's prime pleasures in his simple view, His flock the chief concern he ever knew: She shines but little in his heedless eyes, The good we never miss we rarely prize. But ask the noble drudge in state affairs, Escaped from office and its constant cares, What charms he sees in freedom's smile express'd, In freedom lost so long, now repossess'd; The tongue whose strains were cogent as commands, Revered at home, and felt in foreign lands, Shall own itself a stammerer in that cause, Or plead its silence as its best applause. He knows indeed that whether dress'd or rude, Wild without art, or artfully subdued, Nature in every form inspires delight, But never mark'd her with so just a sight. Her hedge-row shrubs, a variegated store, With woodbine and wild roses mantled o'er, Green balks and furrow'd lands, the stream that spreads Its cooling vapour o'er the dewy meads, Downs that almost escape the enquiring eye, That melt and fade into the distant sky, Beauties he lately slighted as he pass'd, Seem all created since he travell'd last. Master of all the enjoyments he design'd, No rough annoyance rankling in his mind, What early philosophic hours he keeps, How regular his meals, how sound he sleeps! Not sounder he that on the mainmast head, While morning kindles with a windy red, Begins a long look-out for distant land, Nor quits till evening-watch his giddy stand, Then swift descending with a seaman's haste, Slips to his hammock, and forgets the blast. He chooses company, but not the squire's, Whose wit is rudeness, whose good breeding tires; Nor yet the parson's, who would gladly come, Obsequious when abroad, though proud at home; Nor can he much affect the neighb'ring peer, Whose toe of emulation treads too near, But wisely seeks a more convenient friend, With whom, dismissing forms, he may unbend,— A man whom marks of condescending grace Teach, while they flatter him, his proper place,— Who comes when call'd, and at a word withdraws, Speaks with reserve, and listens with applause; Some plain mechanic, who without pretence To birth or wit, nor gives nor takes offence, On whom he rests well pleased his weary powers, And talks and laughs away his vacant hours. The tide of life, swift always in its course, May run in cities with a brisker force, But no where with a current so serene, Or half so clear as in the rural scene. Yet how fallacious is all earthly bliss, What obvious truths the wisest heads may miss! Some pleasures live a month, and some a year, But short the date of all we gather here, Nor happiness is felt, except the true, That does not charm the more for being new. This observation, as it chanced, not made, Or if the thought occurr'd, not duly weigh'd, He sighs,—for after all, by slow degrees, The spot he loved has lost the power to please; To cross his ambling poney day by day Seems at the best but dreaming life away; The prospect, such as might enchant despair, He views it not, or sees no beauty there, With aching heart and discontented looks, Returns at noon to billiards or to books, But feels while grasping at his faded joys A secret thirst of his renounced employs; He chides the tardiness of every post, Pants to be told of battles won or lost, Blames his own indolence, observes, though late, 'Tis criminal to leave a sinking state, Flies to the levee, and received with grace, Kneels, kisses hands, and shines again in place. Suburban villas, highway-side retreats, That dread the encroachment of our growing streets, Tight boxes neatly sash'd, and in a blaze With all a July sun's collected rays, Delight the citizen, who gasping there Breathes clouds of dust, and calls it country air. O sweet retirement, who would baulk the thought That could afford retirement, or could not? 'Tis such an easy walk, so smooth and straight,— The second milestone fronts the garden gate; A step if fair, and if a shower approach You find safe shelter in the next stage-coach. There prison'd in a parlour snug and small, Like bottled wasps upon a southern wall, The man of business and his friends compress'd, Forget their labours, and yet find no rest; But still 'tis rural,—trees are to be seen From every window, and the fields are green; Ducks paddle in the pond before the door, And what could a remoter scene show more? A sense of elegance we rarely find The portion of a mean or vulgar mind, And ignorance of better things makes man Who cannot much, rejoice in what he can; And he that deems his leisure well bestow'd In contemplations of a turnpike road, Is occupied as well, employs his hours As wisely, and as much improves his powers, As he that slumbers in pavilions graced With all the charms of an accomplish'd taste. Yet hence, alas! insolvencies, and hence The unpitied victim of ill-judged expense, From all his wearisome engagements freed, Shakes hands with business, and retires indeed. Your prudent grandmammas, ye modern belles, Content with Bristol, Bath, and Tunbridge Wells, When health required it, would consent to roam, Else more attach'd to pleasures found at home; But now alike, gay widow, virgin, wife, Ingenious to diversify dull life, In coaches, chaises, caravans, and hoys, Fly to the coast for daily, nightly joys, And all impatient of dry land, agree With one consent to rush into the sea.— Ocean exhibits, fathomless and broad, Much of the power and majesty of God; He swathes about the swelling of the deep, That shines and rests, as infants smile and sleep; Vast as it is, it answers as it flows The breathings of the lightest air that blows; Curling and whitening over all the waste, The rising waves obey the increasing blast, Abrupt and horrid as the tempest roars, Thunder and flash upon the steadfast shores; Till he that rides the whirlwind checks the rein, Then all the world of waters sleeps again. Nereids or Dryads, as the fashion leads, Now in the floods, now panting in the meads, Votaries of pleasure still, where'er she dwells, Near barren rocks, in palaces, or cells, Oh grant a poet leave to recommend, (A poet fond of nature and your friend,) Her slighted works to your admiring view, Her works must needs excel who fashion'd you. Would ye, when rambling in your morning ride, With some unmeaning coxcomb at your side, Condemn the prattler for his idle pains, To waste unheard the music of his strains, And deaf to all the impertinence of tongue, That, while it courts, affronts and does you wrong, Mark well the finish'd plan without a fault, The seas globose and huge, the o'erarching vault, Earth's millions daily fed, a world employ'd In gathering plenty yet to be enjoy'd, Till gratitude grew vocal in the praise Of God, beneficent in all his ways,— Graced with such wisdom how would beauty shine! Ye want but that to seem indeed divine. Anticipated rents and bills unpaid Force many a shining youth into the shade, Not to redeem his time, but his estate, And play the fool, but at a cheaper rate. There hid in loath'd obscurity, removed From pleasures left, but never more beloved, He just endures, and with a sickly spleen Sighs o'er the beauties of the charming scene. Nature indeed looks prettily in rhyme, Streams tinkle sweetly in poetic chime, The warblings of the blackbird, clear and strong, Are musical enough in Thomson's song, And Cobham's groves and Windsor's green retreats, When Pope describes them, have a thousand sweets: He likes the country, but in truth must own, Most likes it when he studies it in town. Poor Jack—no matter who,—for when I blame I pity, and must therefore sink the name,— Lived in his saddle, loved the chase, the course, And always, ere he mounted, kiss'd his horse. The estate his sires had own'd in ancient years Was quickly distanced,—match'd against a peer's. Jack vanish'd, was regretted and forgot; 'Tis wild good-nature's never-failing lot. At length, when all had long supposed him dead, By cold submersion, razor, rope, or lead, My lord, alighting at his usual place, The Crown, took notice of an ostler's face. Jack knew his friend, but hoped in that disguise He might escape the most observing eyes, And whistling as if unconcern'd and gay, Curried his nag and look'd another way. Convinced at last, upon a nearer view, 'Twas he, the same, the very Jack he knew, O'erwhelm'd at once with wonder, grief, and joy, He press'd him much to quit his base employ,— His countenance, his purse, his heart, his hand, Influence, and power were all at his command. Peers are not always generous as well-bred; But Granby was,—meant truly what he said. Jack bow'd, and was obliged;—confess'd 'twas strange That so retired he should not wish a change, But knew no medium between guzzling beer And his old stint, three thousand pounds a year. Thus some retire to nourish hopeless woe, Some seeking happiness not found below, Some to comply with humour, and a mind To social scenes by nature disinclined, Some sway'd by fashion, some by deep disgust, Some self-impoverish'd, and because they must; But few that court Retirement are aware Of half the toils they must encounter there. Lucrative offices are seldom lost For want of powers proportion'd to the post: Give even a dunce the employment he desires, And he soon finds the talents it requires; A business with an income at its heels Furnishes always oil for its own wheels. But in his arduous enterprise to close His active years with indolent repose, He finds the labours of that state exceed His utmost faculties, severe indeed. 'Tis easy to resign a toilsome place, But not to manage leisure with a grace; Absence of occupation is not rest, A mind quite vacant is a mind distress'd. The veteran steed excused his task at length, In kind compassion of his failing strength, And turn'd into the park or mead to graze, Exempt from future service all his days, There feels a pleasure perfect in its kind, Ranges at liberty, and snuffs the wind. But when his lord would quit the busy road, To taste a joy like that he has bestow'd, He proves, less happy than his favour'd brute, A life of ease a difficult pursuit. Thought, to the man that never thinks, may seem As natural as when asleep to dream; But reveries, (for human minds will act,) Specious in show, impossible in fact, Those flimsy webs that break as soon as wrought, Attain not to the dignity of thought; Nor yet the swarms that occupy the brain, Where dreams of dress, intrigue, and pleasure reign, Nor such as useless conversation breeds, Or lust engenders, and indulgence feeds. Whence, and what are we? to what end ordain'd? What means the drama by the world sustain'd? Business or vain amusement, care, or mirth, Divide the frail inhabitants of earth. Is duty a mere sport, or an employ? Life an intrusted talent, or a toy? Is there, as reason, conscience, scripture, say, Cause to provide for a great future day, When earth's assign'd duration at an end, Man shall be summon'd, and the dead attend? The trumpet,—will it sound? the curtain rise? And show the august tribunal of the skies, Where no prevarication shall avail, Where eloquence and artifice shall fail, The pride of arrogant distinctions fall, And conscience and our conduct judge us all? Pardon me, ye that give the midnight oil To learned cares or philosophic toil, Though I revere your honourable names, Your useful labours and important aims, And hold the world indebted to your aid, Enrich'd with the discoveries ye have made, Yet let me stand excused, if I esteem A mind employ'd on so sublime a theme, Pushing her bold enquiry to the date And outline of the present transient state, And after poising her adventurous wings, Settling at last upon eternal things, Far more intelligent, and better taught The strenuous use of profitable thought, Than ye when happiest, and enlighten'd most, And highest in renown, can justly boast. A mind unnerved, or indisposed to bear The weight of subjects worthiest of her care, Whatever hopes a change of scene inspires, Must change her nature, or in vain retires. An idler is a watch that wants both hands, As useless if it goes as when it stands. Books therefore, not the scandal of the shelves, In which lewd sensualists print out themselves, Nor those in which the stage gives vice a blow, (With what success let modern manners show;) Nor his, who for the bane of thousands born, Built God a church, and laugh'd his word to scorn, Skilful alike to seem devout and just, And stab religion with a sly side-thrust; Nor those of learn'd philologists, who chase A panting syllable through time and space, Start it at home, and hunt it in the dark, To Gaul, to Greece, and into Noah's ark; But such as learning without false pretence, The friend of truth, the associate of sound sense, And such as in the zeal of good design, Strong judgement labouring in the scripture mine, All such as manly and great souls produce, Worthy to live, and of eternal use; Behold in these what leisure hours demand, Amusement and true knowledge hand in hand. Luxury gives the mind a childish cast, And while she polishes, perverts the taste; Habits of close attention, thinking heads, Become more rare as dissipation spreads, Till authors hear at length, one general cry, Tickle and entertain us, or we die! The loud demand from year to year the same, Beggars invention and makes fancy lame; Till farce itself, most mournfully jejune, Calls for the kind assistance of a tune, And novels, (witness every month's Review,) Belie their name, and offer nothing new. The mind relaxing into needful sport, Should turn to writers of an abler sort, Whose wit well managed, and whose classic style Give truth a lustre, and make wisdom smile. Friends, (for I cannot stint as some have done, Too rigid in my view, that name to one, Though one, I grant it in the generous breast, Will stand advanced a step above the rest; Flowers by that name promiscuously we call, But one, the rose, the regent of them all;) Friends, not adopted with a schoolboy's haste, But chosen with a nice discerning taste, Well born, well disciplined, who, placed apart From vulgar minds, have honour much at heart, And (though the world may think the ingredients odd) The love of virtue, and the fear of God! Such friends prevent what else would soon succeed, A temper rustic as the life we lead, And keep the polish of the manners clean, As theirs who bustle in the busiest scene. For solitude, however some may rave, Seeming a sanctuary, proves a grave, A sepulchre in which the living lie, Where all good qualities grow sick and die. I praise the Frenchman, his remark was shrewd,— How sweet, how passing sweet is solitude! But grant me still a friend in my retreat, Whom I may whisper, solitude is sweet. Yet neither these delights, nor aught beside That appetite can ask, or wealth provide, Can save us always from a tedious day, Or shine the dullness of still life away; Divine communion carefully enjoy'd, Or sought with energy, must fill the void. Oh sacred art, to which alone life owes Its happiest seasons, and a peaceful close, Scorn'd in a world indebted to that scorn For evils daily felt and hardly borne, Not knowing thee, we reap with bleeding hands Flowers of rank odour upon thorny lands, And while experience cautions us in vain, Grasp seeming happiness, and find it pain. Despondence, self-deserted in her grief, Lost by abandoning her own relief; Murmuring and ungrateful discontent, That scorns afflictions mercifully meant; Those humours tart as wines upon the fret, Which idleness and weariness beget; These and a thousand plagues that haunt the breast, Fond of the phantom of an earthly rest, Divine communion chases, as the day Drives to their dens the obedient beasts of prey. See Judah's promised king, bereft of all, Driven out an exile from the face of Saul, To distant caves the lonely wanderer flies, To seek that peace a tyrant's frown denies. Hear the sweet accents of his tuneful voice, Hear him o'erwhelm'd with sorrow, yet rejoice; No womanish or wailing grief has part, No, not a moment, in his royal heart; 'Tis manly music, such as martyrs make, Suffering with gladness for a Saviour's sake: His soul exults, hope animates his lays, The sense of mercy kindles into praise, And wilds familiar with the lion's roar Ring with ecstatic sounds unheard before. 'Tis love like his that can alone defeat The foes of man, or make a desert sweet. Religion does not censure or exclude Unnumber'd pleasures harmlessly pursued. To study culture, and with artful toil To meliorate and tame the stubborn soil; To give dissimilar yet fruitful lands The grain or herb or plant that each demands; To cherish virtue in an humble state, And share the joys your bounty may create; To mark the matchless workings of the power That shuts within its seed the future flower, Bids these in elegance of form excel, In colour these, and those delight the smell, Sends Nature forth, the daughter of the skies, To dance on earth, and charm all human eyes; To teach the canvass innocent deceit, Or lay the landscape on the snowy sheet; These, these are arts pursued without a crime, That leave no stain upon the wing of time. Me poetry (or rather notes that aim Feebly and vainly at poetic fame,) Employs, shut out from more important views, Fast by the banks of the slow-winding Ouse; Content if thus sequester'd I may raise A monitor's, though not a poet's praise, And while I teach an art too little known, To close life wisely, may not waste my own. THE DOVES. Reasoning at every step he treads, Man yet mistakes his way, While meaner things whom instinct leads Are rarely known to stray. One silent eve I wander'd late, And heard the voice of love; The turtle thus address'd her mate, And soothed the listening dove: Our mutual bond of faith and truth, No time shall disengage; Those blessings of our early youth Shall cheer our latest age. While innocence without disguise, And constancy sincere, Shall fill the circles of those eyes, And mine can read them there, Those ills that wait on all below Shall ne'er be felt by me, Or gently felt, and only so, As being shared with thee. When lightnings flash among the trees, Or kites are hovering near, I fear lest thee alone they seize, And know no other fear. 'Tis then I feel myself a wife, And press thy wedded side, Resolved a union form'd for life Death never shall divide. But oh! if fickle and unchaste, (Forgive a transient thought,) Thou couldst become unkind at last, And scorn thy present lot, No need of lightnings from on high, Or kites with cruel beak, Denied the endearments of thine eye This widow'd heart would break. Thus sang the sweet sequester'd bird, Soft as the passing wind; And I recorded what I heard, A lesson for mankind. A FABLE. A raven while with glossy breast Her new-laid eggs she fondly press'd, And on her wicker-work high mounted Her chickens prematurely counted, (A fault philosophers might blame, If quite exempted from the same,) Enjoy'd at ease the genial day, 'Twas April as the bumkins say, The legislature call'd it May: But suddenly a wind as high As ever swept a winter sky, Shook the young leaves about her ears, And fill'd her with a thousand fears, Lest the rude blast should snap the bough, And spread her golden hopes below. But just at eve the blowing weather And all her fears were hush'd together: And now, quoth poor unthinking Raph, 'Tis over, and the brood is safe; (For ravens, though as birds of omen They teach both conjurers and old women To tell us what is to befall, Can't prophesy themselves at all.) The morning came, when neighbour Hodge, Who long had mark'd her airy lodge, And destined all the treasure there A gift to his expecting fair, Climb'd like a squirrel to his dray, And bore the worthless prize away. MORAL. 'Tis Providence alone secures, In every change, both mine and your's. Safety consists not in escape From dangers of a frightful shape, An earthquake may be bid to spare The man that's strangled by a hair. Fate steals along with silent tread, Found oftenest in what least we dread, Frowns in the storm with angry brow, But in the sunshine strikes the blow. A COMPARISON. The lapse of time and rivers is the same, Both speed their journey with a restless stream, The silent pace with which they steal away, No wealth can bribe, no prayers persuade to stay, Alike irrevocable both when past, And a wide ocean swallows both at last. Though each resemble each in every part, A difference strikes at length the musing heart; Streams never flow in vain; where streams abound, How laughs the land with various plenty crown'd! But time that should enrich the nobler mind, Neglected, leaves a dreary waste behind. ANOTHER [COMPARISON] ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY. Sweet stream that winds through yonder glade, Apt emblem of a virtuous maid— Silent and chaste she steals along, Far from the world's gay busy throng, With gentle yet prevailing force Intent upon her destined course, Graceful and useful all she does, Blessing and blest where'er she goes, Pure-bosom'd as that watery glass, And heaven reflected in her face. VERSES, SUPPOSED TO BE WRITTEN BY ALEXANDER SELKIRK, DURING HIS SOLITARY ABODE IN THE ISLAND OF JUAN FERNANDEZ. I am monarch of all I survey, My right there is none to dispute, From the centre all round to the sea, I am lord of the fowl and the brute. O solitude! where are the charms That sages have seen in thy face? Better dwell in the midst of alarms, Than reign in this horrible place. I am out of humanity's reach, I must finish my journey alone, Never hear the sweet music of speech,— I start at the sound of my own. The beasts that roam over the plain My form with indifference see, They are so unacquainted with man, Their tameness is shocking to me. Society, friendship, and love, Divinely bestow'd upon man, Oh had I the wings of a dove, How soon would I taste you again! My sorrows I then might assuage In the ways of religion and truth, Might learn from the wisdom of age, And be cheer'd by the sallies of youth. Religion! what treasure untold Resides in that heavenly word! More precious than silver and gold, Or all that this earth can afford. But the sound of the church-going bell These valleys and rocks never heard, Ne'er sigh'd at the sound of a knell, Or smiled when a sabbath appear'd. Ye winds that have made me your sport, Convey to this desolate shore Some cordial endearing report Of a land I shall visit no more! My friends, do they now and then send A wish or a thought after me? Oh tell me I yet have a friend, Though a friend I am never to see. How fleet is a glance of the mind! Compared with the speed of its flight, The tempest itself lags behind, And the swift winged arrows of light. When I think of my own native land, In a moment I seem to be there; But alas! recollection at hand Soon hurries me back to despair. But the sea-fowl is gone to her nest, The beast is laid down in his lair, Even here is a season of rest, And I to my cabin repair. There is mercy in every place, And mercy, encouraging thought! Gives even affliction a grace, And reconciles man to his lot. ON THE PROMOTION OF EDWARD THURLOW, ESQ. TO THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLORSHIP OF ENGLAND. Round Thurlow's head in early youth, And in his sportive days, Fair science pour'd the light of truth, And genius shed his rays. See! with united wonder, cried The experienced and the sage, Ambition in a boy supplied With all the skill of age. Discernment, eloquence, and grace Proclaim him born to sway The balance in the highest place, And bear the palm away. The praise bestow'd was just and wise; He sprang impetuous forth, Secure of conquest, where the prize Attends superior worth. So the best courser on the plain Ere yet he starts is known, And does but at the goal obtain What all had deem'd his own. ODE TO PEACE. Come, peace of mind, delightful guest! Return and make thy downy nest Once more in this sad heart: Nor riches I, nor power pursue, Nor hold forbidden joys in view, We therefore need not part. Where wilt thou dwell if not with me, From avarice and ambition free, And pleasure's fatal wiles? For whom, alas! dost thou prepare The sweets that I was wont to share, The banquet of thy smiles? The great, the gay, shall they partake The heaven that thou alone canst make; And wilt thou quit the stream That murmurs through the dewy mead, The grove and the sequester'd shed, To be a guest with them? For thee I panted, thee I prized, For thee I gladly sacrificed Whate'er I loved before; And shall I see thee start away, And helpless, hopeless, hear thee say— Farewell! we meet no more? HUMAN FRAILTY. Weak and irresolute is man; The purpose of to-day, Woven with pains into his plan, To-morrow rends away. The bow well bent and smart the spring, Vice seems already slain, But passion rudely snaps the string, And it revives again. Some foe to his upright intent Finds out his weaker part, Virtue engages his assent, But pleasure wins his heart. 'Tis here the folly of the wise Through all his art we view, And while his tongue the charge denies, His conscience owns it true. Bound on a voyage of aweful length And dangers little known, A stranger to superior strength, Man vainly trusts his own. But oars alone can ne'er prevail To reach the distant coast, The breath of heaven must swell the sail, Or all the toil is lost. THE MODERN PATRIOT. Rebellion is my theme all day, I only wish 'twould come (As who knows but perhaps it may) A little nearer home. Yon roaring boys who rave and fight On the other side the Atlantic, I always held them in the right, But most so, when most frantic. When lawless mobs insult the court, That man shall be my toast, If breaking windows be the sport Who bravely breaks the most. But oh! for him my fancy culls The choicest flowers she bears, Who constitutionally pulls Your house about your ears. Such civil broils are my delight, Though some folks can't endure 'em, Who say the mob are mad outright, And that a rope must cure 'em. A rope! I wish we patriots had Such strings for all who need 'em,— What! hang a man for going mad? Then farewell British freedom. ON OBSERVING SOME NAMES OF LITTLE NOTE RECORDED IN THE BIOGRAPHIA BRITANNICA. Oh fond attempt to give a deathless lot, To names ignoble, born to be forgot! In vain recorded in historic page, They court the notice of a future age, Those twinkling tiny lustres of the land Drop one by one from fame's neglecting hand, Lethean gulfs receive them as they fall, And dark oblivion soon absorbs them all. So when a child, as playful children use, Has burnt to tinder a stale last year's news, The flame extinct, he views the roving fire, There goes my lady, and there goes the 'squire; There goes the parson, oh! illustrious spark, And there, scarce less illustrious, goes the clerk. REPORT OF AN ADJUDGED CASE NOT TO BE FOUND IN ANY OF THE BOOKS. Between Nose and Eyes a strange contest arose, The spectacles set them unhappily wrong; The point in dispute was, as all the world knows, To which the said spectacles ought to belong. So the Tongue was the lawyer and argued the cause With a great deal of skill, and a wig full of learning, While chief baron Ear sat to balance the laws, So famed for his talent in nicely discerning. In behalf of the Nose, it will quickly appear, And your lordship, he said, will undoubtedly find, That the Nose has had spectacles always in wear, Which amounts to possession time out of mind. Then holding the spectacles up to the court,— Your lordship observes they are made with a straddle, As wide as the ridge of the Nose is, in short, Design'd to sit close to it, just like a saddle. Again, would your lordship a moment suppose ('Tis a case that has happen'd and may be again,) That the visage or countenance had not a Nose, Pray who would or who could wear spectacles then? On the whole it appears, and my argument shows With a reasoning the court will never condemn, That the spectacles plainly were made for the Nose, And the Nose was as plainly intended for them. Then shifting his side, as a lawyer knows how, He pleaded again in behalf of the Eyes, But what were his arguments few people know, For the court did not think they were equally wise. So his lordship decreed, with a grave solemn tone, Decisive and clear, without one if or but,— That whenever the Nose put his spectacles on, By daylight or candlelight—Eyes should be shut. ON THE BURNING OF LORD MANSFIELD'S LIBRARY, TOGETHER WITH HIS MSS. BY THE MOB, IN THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1780. So then—the Vandals of our isle, Sworn foes to sense and law, Have burnt to dust a nobler pile Than ever Roman saw! And Murray sighs o'er Pope and Swift, And many a treasure more, The well-judged purchase and the gift That graced his letter'd store. Their pages mangled, burnt, and torn, The loss was his alone; But ages yet to come shall mourn The burning of his own. ON THE SAME [THE BURNING OF LORD MANSFIELD'S LIBRARY]. When wit and genius meet their doom In all devouring flame, They tell us of the fate of Rome, And bid us fear the same. O'er Murray's loss the Muses wept, They felt the rude alarm, Yet bless'd the guardian care that kept His sacred head from harm. There memory, like the bee that's fed From Flora's balmy store, The quintessence of all he read Had treasured up before. The lawless herd, with fury blind Have done him cruel wrong; The flowers are gone,—but still we find The honey on his tongue. THE LOVE OF THE WORLD REPROVED; OR, HYPOCRISY DETECTED. Thus says the prophet of the Turk; Good mussulman, abstain from pork! There is a part in every swine No friend or follower of mine May taste, whate'er his inclination, On pain of excommunication. Such Mahomet's mysterious charge, And thus he left the point at large. Had he the sinful part express'd, They might with safety eat the rest; But for one piece they thought it hard From the whole hog to be debarr'd, And set their wit at work to find What joint the prophet had in mind. Much controversy straight arose, These choose the back, the belly those; By some 'tis confidently said He meant not to forbid the head, While others at that doctrine rail, And piously prefer the tail. Thus, conscience freed from every clog, Mahometans eat up the hog. You laugh!—'tis well,—the tale applied May make you laugh on t'other side. Renounce the world, the preacher cries;— We do,—a multitude replies. While one as innocent regards A snug and friendly game at cards; And one, whatever you may say, Can see no evil in a play; Some love a concert or a race, And others, shooting and the chase. Reviled and loved, renounced and follow'd, Thus bit by bit the world is swallow'd; Each thinks his neighbour makes too free, Yet likes a slice as well as he, With sophistry their sauce they sweeten, Till quite from tail to snout 'tis eaten. THE LILY AND THE ROSE. The nymph must lose her female friend If more admired than she,— But where will fierce contention end If flowers can disagree? Within the garden's peaceful scene Appear'd two lovely foes, Aspiring to the rank of queen, The Lily and the Rose. The Rose soon redden'd into rage, And swelling with disdain, Appeal'd to many a poet's page To prove her right to reign. The Lily's height bespoke command, A fair imperial flower, She seem'd design'd for Flora's hand, The sceptre of her power. This civil bickering and debate The goddess chanced to hear, And flew to save, ere yet too late, The pride of the parterre. Yours is, she said, the nobler hue, And yours the statelier mien, And till a third surpasses you, Let each be deem'd a queen. Thus soothed and reconciled, each seeks The fairest British fair, The seat of empire is her cheeks, They reign united there. THE NIGHTINGALE AND GLOW-WORM. A Nightingale that all day long Had cheer'd the village with his song, Nor yet at eve his note suspended, Nor yet when eventide was ended, Began to feel, as well he might, The keen demands of appetite; When looking eagerly around, He spied, far off upon the ground, A something shining in the dark, And knew the Glow-worm by his spark; So stooping down from hawthorn top, He thought to put him in his crop; The worm, aware of his intent, Harangued him thus right eloquent.— “Did you admire my lamp,” quoth he, “As much as I your minstrelsy, You would abhor to do me wrong, As much as I to spoil your song, For 'twas the self-same power divine Taught you to sing, and me to shine, That you with music, I with light, Might beautify and cheer the night.” The songster heard his short oration, And warbling out his approbation, Released him, as my story tells, And found a supper somewhere else. Hence jarring sectaries may learn, Their real interest to discern: That brother should not war with brother, And worry and devour each other, But sing and shine by sweet consent, Till life's poor transient night is spent, Respecting in each other's case The gifts of nature and of grace. Those Christians best deserve the name, Who studiously make peace their aim; Peace, both the duty and the prize Of him that creeps and him that flies. ON A GOLDFINCH STARVED TO DEATH IN HIS CAGE. Time was when I was free as air, The thistle's downy seed my fare, My drink the morning dew; I perch'd at will on every spray, My form genteel, my plumage gay, My strains for ever new. But gaudy plumage, sprightly strain, And form genteel were all in vain And of a transient date, For caught and caged and starved to death, In dying sighs my little breath Soon pass'd the wiry grate. Thanks, gentle swain, for all my woes, And thanks for this effectual close, And cure of every ill! More cruelty could none express, And I, if you had shown me less, Had been your prisoner still. THE PINE APPLE AND THE BEE. The Pine Apples in triple row Were basking hot and all in blow, A Bee of most discerning taste Perceived the fragrance as he pass'd; On eager wing the spoiler came, And search'd for crannies in the frame, Urged his attempt on every side, To every pane his trunk applied, But still in vain, the frame was tight And only pervious to the light. Thus having wasted half the day, He trimmed his flight another way. Methinks, I said, in thee I find The sin and madness of mankind; To joys forbidden man aspires, Consumes his soul with vain desires; Folly the spring of his pursuit, And disappointment all the fruit. While Cynthio ogles as she passes The nymph between two chariot glasses, She is the Pine Apple, and he The silly unsuccessful Bee. The maid who views with pensive air The show-glass fraught with glittering ware, Sees watches, bracelets, rings, and lockets, But sighs at thought of empty pockets, Like thine her appetite is keen, But ah the cruel glass between! Our dear delights are often such, Exposed to view but not to touch; The sight our foolish heart inflames, We long for pine apples in frames; With hopeless wish one looks and lingers, One breaks the glass and cuts his fingers, But they whom truth and wisdom lead, Can gather honey from a weed. HORACE. BOOK II. ODE X. Receive, dear friend, the truths I teach, So shalt thou live beyond the reach Of adverse fortune's power; Not always tempt the distant deep, Nor always timorously creep Along the treacherous shore. He that holds fast the golden mean, And lives contentedly between The little and the great, Feels not the wants that pinch the poor, Nor plagues that haunt the rich man's door, Imbittering all his state. The tallest pines feel most the power Of wintry blast, the loftiest tower Comes heaviest to the ground; The bolts that spare the mountain's side, His cloud-capt eminence divide And spread the ruin round. The well-inform'd philosopher Rejoices with an wholesome fear, And hopes in spite of pain; If winter bellow from the north, Soon the sweet spring comes dancing forth, And nature laughs again. What if thine heaven be overcast, The dark appearance will not last, Expect a brighter sky; The God that strings the silver bow, Awakes sometimes the Muses too, And lays his arrows by. If hinderances obstruct thy way, Thy magnanimity display, And let thy strength be seen; But oh! if Fortune fill thy sail With more than a propitious gale, Take half thy canvass in! A REFLECTION ON THE FOREGOING ODE. And is this all? Can reason do no more Than bid me shun the deep and dread the shore? Sweet moralist! afloat on life's rough sea The Christian has an art unknown to thee; He holds no parley with unmanly fears, Where duty bids he confidently steers, Faces a thousand dangers at her call, And trusting in his God, surmounts them all. TRANSLATIONS FROM VINCENT BOURNE. I. THE GLOW-WORM. Beneath the hedge or near the stream, A worm is known to stray, That shows by night a lucid beam, Which disappears by day. Disputes have been and still prevail From whence his rays proceed; Some give that honour to his tail, And others to his head. But this is sure,—the hand of might That kindles up the skies, Gives him a modicum of light, Proportion'd to his size. Perhaps indulgent Nature meant By such a lamp bestow'd, To bid the traveller, as he went, Be careful where he trod; Nor crush a worm, whose useful light Might serve, however small, To show a stumbling stone by night, And save him from a fall. Whate'er she meant, this truth divine Is legible and plain, 'Tis power Almighty bids him shine, Nor bids him shine in vain. Ye proud and wealthy, let this theme Teach humbler thoughts to you, Since such a reptile has its gem, And boasts its splendour too. II. THE JACKDAW. There is a bird who by his coat, And by the hoarseness of his note, Might be supposed a crow; A great frequenter of the church, Where bishop-like he finds a perch, And dormitory too. Above the steeple shines a plate, That turns and turns, to indicate From what point blows the weather; Look up,—your brains begin to swim, 'Tis in the clouds;—that pleases him, He chooses it the rather. Fond of the speculative height, Thither he wings his airy flight, And thence securely sees The bustle and the raree-show That occupy mankind below, Secure and at his ease. You think no doubt he sits and muses On future broken bones and bruises, If he should chance to fall; No not a single thought like that Employs his philosophic pate, Or troubles it at all. He sees that this great roundabout The world, with all its motley rout, Church, army, physic, law, Its customs and its businesses Are no concern at all of his, And says,—what says he? Caw. Thrice happy bird! I too have seen Much of the vanities of men, And sick of having seen 'em, Would cheerfully these limbs resign For such a pair of wings as thine, And such a head between 'em. III. THE CRICKET. Little inmate, full of mirth, Chirping on my kitchen hearth; Wheresoe'er be thine abode, Always harbinger of good, Pay me for thy warm retreat, With a song more soft and sweet, In return thou shalt receive Such a strain as I can give. Thus thy praise shall be exprest, Inoffensive, welcome guest! While the rat is on the scout, And the mouse with curious snout, With what vermin else infest Every dish, and spoil the best; Frisking thus before the fire, Thou hast all thine heart's desire. Though in voice and shape they be Form'd as if akin to thee, Thou surpassest, happier far, Happiest grasshoppers that are; Theirs is but a summer's song, Thine endures the winter long, Unimpair'd and shrill and clear, Melody throughout the year. Neither night nor dawn of day Puts a period to thy play. Sing then—and extend thy span Far beyond the date of man; Wretched man, whose years are spent In repining discontent, Lives not, aged though he be, Half a span compared with thee. IV. THE PARROT. In painted plumes superbly drest, A native of the gorgeous east, By many a billow tost, Poll gains at length the British shore, Part of the captain's precious store, A present to his toast. Belinda's maids are soon preferr'd To teach him now and then a word, As Poll can master it; But 'tis her own important charge To qualify him more at large, And make him quite a wit. “Sweet Poll!” his doting mistress cries, “Sweet Poll!” the mimic bird replies, And calls aloud for sack; She next instructs him in the kiss, 'Tis now a little one like Miss, And now a hearty smack. At first he aims at what he hears And listening close with both his ears, Just catches at the sound; But soon articulates aloud, Much to the amusement of the crowd And stuns the neighbours round. A querulous old woman's voice His humorous talent next employs, He scolds and gives the lie; And now he sings, and now is sick, Here, Sally, Susan, come, come quick, Poor Poll is like to die. Belinda and her bird! 'tis rare To meet with such a well-match'd pair, The language and the tone, Each character in every part Sustain'd with so much grace and art, And both in unison. When children first begin to spell, And stammer out a syllable, We think them tedious creatures; But difficulties soon abate, When birds are to be taught to prate, And women are the teachers. THE SHRUBBERY. WRITTEN IN A TIME OF AFFLICTION. Oh happy shades! to me unblest, Friendly to peace, but not to me, How ill the scene that offers rest, And heart that cannot rest, agree! This glassy stream, that spreading pine, Those alders quivering to the breeze, Might sooth a soul less hurt than mine, And please, if any thing could please. But fixt unalterable care Foregoes not what she feels within, Shows the same sadness every where, And slights the season and the scene. For all that pleased in wood or lawn, While peace possess'd these silent bowers, Her animating smile withdrawn, Has lost its beauties and its powers. The saint or moralist should tread This moss-grown alley, musing slow; They seek like me the secret shade, But not like me, to nourish woe. Me fruitful scenes and prospects waste, Alike admonish not to roam; These tell me of enjoyments past, And those of sorrows yet to come. THE WINTER NOSEGAY. What Nature, alas! has denied To the delicate growth of our isle, Art has in a measure supplied, And winter is deck'd with a smile. See, Mary, what beauties I bring From the shelter of that sunny shed, Where the flowers have the charms of the spring, Though abroad they are frozen and dead. 'Tis a bower of Arcadian sweets, Where Flora is still in her prime; A fortress to which she retreats, From the cruel assaults of the clime. While earth wears a mantle of snow, These pinks are as fresh and as gay, As the fairest and sweetest that blow On the beautiful bosom of May. See how they have safely survived The frowns of a sky so severe! Such Mary's true love that has lived Through many a turbulent year. The charms of the late-blowing rose, Seem graced with a livelier hue, And the winter of sorrow best shows The truth of a friend, such as you. MUTUAL FORBEARANCE, NECESSARY TO THE HAPPINESS OF THE MARRIED STATE. The lady thus address'd her spouse;— What a mere dungeon is this house! By no means large enough, and was it, Yet this dull room and that dark closet, Those hangings with their worn-out graces, Long beards, long noses, and pale faces, Are such an antiquated scene, They overwhelm me with the spleen. —Sir Humphrey shooting in the dark, Makes answer quite beside the mark. No doubt, my dear, I bade him come, Engaged myself to be at home, And shall expect him at the door Precisely when the clock strikes four. You are so deaf, the lady cried, (And raised her voice and frown'd beside,) You are so sadly deaf, my dear, What shall I do to make you hear? Dismiss poor Harry? he replies, Some people are more nice than wise; For one slight trespass all this stir? What if he did ride, whip and spur, 'Twas but a mile,—your favourite horse Will never look one hair the worse. Well, I protest 'tis past all bearing!— Child! I am rather heard of hearing.— Yes, truly—one must scream and bawl, I tell you you can't hear at all. Then with a voice exceeding low, No matter if you hear or no. Alas! and is domestic strife, That sorest ill of human life, A plague so little to be fear'd, As to be wantonly incurr'd; To gratify a fretful passion, On every trivial provocation? The kindest and the happiest pair Will find occasion to forbear, And something every day they live, To pity, and perhaps, forgive. But if infirmities that fall In common to the lot of all, A blemish, or a sense impair'd, Are crimes so little to be spared, Then, farewell all that must create The comfort of the wedded state; Instead of harmony, 'tis jar And tumult and intestine war. The love that cheers life's latest stage, Proof against sickness and old age, Preserved by virtue from declension, Becomes not weary of attention, But lives, when that exterior grace Which first inspired the flame, decays. 'Tis gentle, delicate, and kind, To faults compassionate or blind, And will with sympathy endure Those evils it would gladly cure. But angry, coarse, and harsh expression Shows love to be a mere profession, Proves that the heart is none of his, Or soon expels him if it is. TO THE REV. MR. NEWTON. AN INVITATION INTO THE COUNTRY. The swallows in their torpid state Compose their useless wing, And bees in hives as idly wait The call of early spring. The keenest frost that binds the stream, The wildest wind that blows, Are neither felt nor fear'd by them, Secure of their repose. But man all feeling and awake The gloomy scene surveys, With present ills his heart must ache, And pant for brighter days. Old Winter halting o'er the mead, Bids me and Mary mourn; But lovely Spring peeps o'er his head, And whispers your return. Then April with her sister May Shall chase him from the bowers, And weave fresh garlands every day, To crown the smiling hours. And if a tear that speaks regret Of happier times appear, A glimpse of joy that we have met Shall shine, and dry the tear. BOADICEA. AN ODE. When the British warrior queen, Bleeding from the Roman rods, Sought with an indignant mien, Counsel of her country's Gods, Sage beneath a spreading oak Sat the Druid, hoary chief, Every burning word he spoke Full of rage and full of grief. Princess! if our aged eyes Weep upon thy matchless wrongs, 'Tis because resentment ties All the terrors of our tongues. Rome shall perish,—write that word In the blood that she has spilt; Perish hopeless and abhorr'd, Deep in ruin as in guilt. Rome for empire far renown'd, Tramples on a thousand states, Soon her pride shall kiss the ground,— Hark! the Gaul is at her gates. Other Romans shall arise, Heedless of a soldier's name, Sounds, not arms, shall win the prize, Harmony the path to fame. Then the progeny that springs From the forests of our land, Arm'd with thunder, clad with wings, Shall a wider world command. Regions Cæsar never knew, Thy posterity shall sway, Where his eagles never flew, None invincible as they. Such the bard's prophetic words, Pregnant with celestial fire, Bending as he swept the chords Of his sweet but aweful lyre. She with all a monarch's pride, Felt them in her bosom glow, Rush'd to battle, fought and died, Dying, hurl'd them at the foe. Ruffians, pitiless as proud, Heaven awards the vengeance due; Empire is on us bestow'd, Shame and ruin wait for you! HEROISM. There was a time when Ætna's silent fire Slept unperceived, the mountain yet entire, When conscious of no danger from below, She tower'd a cloud-capt pyramid of snow. No thunders shook with deep intestine sound The blooming groves that girdled her around; Her unctuous olives and her purple vines, (Unfelt the fury of those bursting mines,) The peasant's hopes, and not in vain, assured, In peace upon her sloping sides matured. When on a day, like that of the last doom, A conflagration labouring in her womb, She teem'd and heaved with an infernal birth, That shook the circling seas and solid earth. Dark and voluminous the vapours rise, And hang their horrors in the neighbouring skies, While through the Stygian veil that blots the day, In dazzling streaks the vivid lightnings play. But oh! what muse, and in what powers of song, Can trace the torrent as it burns along? Havoc and devastation in the van, It marches o'er the prostrate works of man, Vines, olives, herbage, forests disappear, And all the charms of a Sicilian year. Revolving seasons, fruitless as they pass, See it an uninform'd and idle mass, Without a soil to invite the tiller's care, Or blade that might redeem it from despair. Yet time at length (what will not time achieve?) Clothes it with earth, and bids the produce live. Once more the spiry myrtle crowns the glade, And ruminating flocks enjoy the shade. Oh bliss precarious, and unsafe retreats, Oh charming paradise of short-lived sweets! The self-same gale that wafts the fragrance round Brings to the distant ear a sullen sound, Again the mountain feels the imprison'd foe, Again pours ruin on the vale below, Ten thousand swains the wasted scene deplore, That only future ages can restore. Ye monarchs, whom the lure of honour draws, Who write in blood the merits of your cause, Who strike the blow, then plead your own defence, Glory your aim, but justice your pretence, Behold in Ætna's emblematic fires The mischiefs your ambitious pride inspires! Fast by the stream that bounds your just domain, And tells you where ye have a right to reign, A nation dwells, not envious of your throne, Studious of peace, their neighbours' and their own. Ill-fated race! how deeply must they rue Their only crime, vicinity to you! The trumpet sounds, your legions swarm abroad, Through the ripe harvest lies their destined road, At every step beneath their feet they tread The life of multitudes, a nation's bread; Earth seems a garden in its loveliest dress Before them, and behind a wilderness; Famine and Pestilence, her first-born son, Attend to finish what the sword begun, And echoing praises such as fiends might earn, And folly pays, resound at your return. A calm succeeds;—but plenty with her train Of heartfelt joys, succeeds not soon again, And years of pining indigence must show What scourges are the gods that rule below. Yet man, laborious man, by slow degrees, (Such is his thirst of opulence and ease,) Plies all the sinews of industrious toil, Gleans up the refuse of the general spoil, Rebuilds the towers that smoked upon the plain, And the sun gilds the shining spires again. Increasing commerce and reviving art Renew the quarrel on the conqueror's part, And the sad lesson must be learn'd once more, That wealth within is ruin at the door. What are ye monarchs, laurel'd heroes, say, But Ætnas of the suffering world ye sway? Sweet nature stripp'd of her embroider'd robe, Deplores the wasted regions of her globe, And stands a witness at Truth's aweful bar, To prove you there, destroyers as ye are. Oh place me in some heaven-protected isle, Where peace and equity and freedom smile, Where no volcano pours his fiery flood, No crested warrior dips his plume in blood, Where power secures what industry has won, Where to succeed is not to be undone, A land that distant tyrants hate in vain, In Britain's isle, beneath a George's reign. THE POET, THE OYSTER, AND SENSITIVE PLANT. An Oyster cast upon the shore Was heard, though never heard before, Complaining in a speech well worded, And worthy thus to be recorded: Ah hapless wretch! condemn'd to dwell For ever in my native shell, Ordain'd to move when others please, Not for my own content or ease, But toss'd and buffeted about, Now in the water, and now out. 'Twere better to be born a stone Of ruder shape and feeling none, Than with a tenderness like mine, And sensibilities so fine! I envy that unfeeling shrub, Fast-rooted against every rub. The plant he meant grew not far off, And felt the sneer with scorn enough, Was hurt, disgusted, mortified, And with asperity replied. When, cry the botanists, and stare, Did plants call'd Sensitive grow there? No matter when—a poet's muse is To make them grow just where she chooses. You shapeless nothing in a dish, You that are but almost a fish, I scorn your coarse insinuation, And have most plentiful occasion To wish myself the rock I view, Or such another dolt as you. For many a grave and learned clerk, And many a gay unletter'd spark, With curious touch examines me, If I can feel as well as he; And when I bend, retire, and shrink, Says, well—'tis more than one would think.— Thus life is spent, oh fie upon't! In being touch'd, and crying, don't. A poet in his evening walk, O'erheard and check'd this idle talk. And your fine sense, he said, and yours, Whatever evil it endures, Deserves not, if so soon offended, Much to be pitied or commended. Disputes though short, are far too long, Where both alike are in the wrong; Your feelings in their full amount, Are all upon your own account. You in your grotto-work enclosed Complain of being thus exposed, Yet nothing feel in that rough coat, Save when the knife is at your throat, Wherever driven by wind or tide, Exempt from every ill beside. And as for you, my Lady Squeamish, Who reckon every touch a blemish, If all the plants that can be found Embellishing the scene around, Should droop and wither where they grow, You would not feel at all, not you. The noblest minds their virtue prove By pity, sympathy, and love; These, these are feelings truly fine, And prove their owner half divine. His censure reach'd them as he deal it, And each by shrinking show'd he felt it. TO THE REV. WILLIAM CAWTHORNE UNWIN. Unwin, I should but ill repay The kindness of a friend, Whose worth deserves as warm a lay As ever friendship penn'd, Thy name omitted in a page That would reclaim a vicious age. An union form'd, as mine with thee, Not rashly or in sport, May be as fervent in degree, And faithful in its sort, And may as rich in comfort prove, As that of true fraternal love. The bud inserted in the rind, The bud of peach or rose, Adorns, though differing in its kind, The stock whereon it grows With flower as sweet or fruit as fair As if produced by nature there. Not rich, I render what I may; I seize thy name in haste, And place it in this first assay, Lest this should prove the last. 'Tis where it should be, in a plan That holds in view the good of man. The poet's lyre, to fix his fame, Should be the poet's heart; Affection lights a brighter flame Than ever blazed by art. No muses on these lines attend, I sink the poet in the friend. END OF VOL.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. IX. TRANSLATIONS FROM THE FRENCH OF MADAME DE LA MOTHE GUION. THE NATIVITY. 'Tis folly all!—let me no more be told Of Parian porticos, and roofs of gold; Delightful views of nature, dress'd by art, Enchant no longer this indifferent heart; The Lord of all things, in his humble birth, Makes mean the proud magnificence of earth; The straw, the manger, and the mouldering wall, Eclipse its lustre; and I scorn it all. Canals, and fountains, and delicious vales, Green slopes and plains, whose plenty never fails; Deep rooted groves, whose heads sublimely rise, Earth-born, and yet ambitious of the skies, The abundant foliage of whose gloomy shades Vainly the sun in all its power invades, Where warbled airs of sprightly birds resound, Whose verdure lives while Winter scowls around: Rocks, lofty mountains, caverns dark and deep, And torrents raving down the rugged steep, Smooth downs, whose fragrant herbs the spirits cheer, Meads crown'd with flowers, streams musical and clear, Whose silver waters and whose murmurs join Their artless charms, to make the scene divine; The fruitful vineyard, and the furrow'd plain, That seems a rolling sea of golden grain, All, all have lost the charms they once possess'd; An infant God reigns sovereign in my breast; From Bethlehem's bosom I no more will rove; There dwells the Saviour, and there rests my love. Ye mightier rivers, that with sounding force, Urge down the valleys your impetuous course! Winds, clouds, and lightnings! and, ye waves, whose heads, Curl'd into monstrous forms, the seaman dreads! Horrid abyss, where all experience fails, Spread with the wreck of planks and shatter'd sails; On whose broad back grim Death triumphant rides, While havock floats on all thy swelling tides, Thy shores a scene of ruin, strew'd around With vessels bulged, and bodies of the drown'd! Ye fish that sport beneath the boundless waves, And rest, secure from man, in rocky caves; Swift-darting sharks, and whales of hideous size, Whom all the aquatic world with terror eyes! Had I but faith immoveable and true, I might defy the fiercest storm, like you. The world, a more disturb'd and boisterous sea, When Jesus shows a smile, affrights not me; He hides me, and in vain the billows roar, Break harmless at my feet, and leave the shore. Thou azure vault, where through the gloom of night, Thick sown, we see such countless worlds of light! Thou Moon, whose car encompassing the skies, Restores lost nature to our wondering eyes, Again retiring when the brighter Sun Begins the course he seems in haste to run, Behold him where he shines! His rapid rays, Themselves unmeasured, measure all our days; Nothing impedes the race he would pursue, Nothing escapes his penetrating view, A thousand lands confess his quickening heat, And all he cheers are fruitful, fair, and sweet. Far from enjoying what these scenes disclose, I feel the thorn, alas! but miss the rose: Too well I know this aching heart requires More solid good to fill its vast desires; In vain they represent His matchless might, Who call'd them out of deep primeval night; Their form and beauty but augment my woe: I seek the Giver of those charms they show: Nor, Him beside, throughout the world He made, Lives there in whom I trust for cure or aid. Infinite God, thou great unrival'd One! Whose glory makes a blot of yonder sun; Compared with thine, how dim his beauty seems, How quench'd the radiance of his golden beams! Thou art my bliss, the light by which I move; In Thee alone dwells all that I can love; All darkness flies when Thou art pleased to appear, A sudden spring renews the fading year; Where'er I turn I see thy power and grace, The watchful guardians of our heedless race; Thy various creatures in one strain agree, All, in all times and places, speak of Thee; Even I, with trembling heart and stammering tongue, Attempt thy praise, and join the general song. Almighty Former of this wondrous plan, Faintly reflected in thine image, Man,— Holy and just, the greatness of whose name Fills and supports this universal frame, Diffused throughout the infinitude of space, Who art Thyself thine own vast dwelling place; Soul of our soul, whom yet no sense of ours Discerns, eluding our most active powers; Encircling shades attend thine awful throne, That veil thy face, and keep thee still unknown, Unknown, though dwelling in our inmost part, Lord of the thoughts, and Sovereign of the heart! Repeat the charming truth that never tires, No God is like the God my soul desires! He at whose voice heaven trembles, even He, Great as he is, knows how to stoop to me. Lo! there he lies,—that smiling infant said, “Heaven, earth, and sea exist!”—and they obey'd. Even He, whose Being swells beyond the skies, Is born of woman, lives, and mourns, and dies; Eternal and Immortal, seems to cast That glory from his brows, and breathes his last. Trivial and vain the works that man has wrought, How do they shrink and vanish at the thought! Sweet solitude, and scene of my repose! This rustic sight assuages all my woes.— That crib contains the Lord, whom I adore; And earth's a shade, that I pursue no more. He is my firm support, my rock, my tower, I dwell secure beneath his sheltering power, And hold this mean retreat for ever dear, For all I love, my soul's delight, is here. I see the Almighty swathed in infant bands, Tied helpless down the thunder-bearer's hands, And, in this shed, that mystery discern, Which Faith and Love, and they alone, can learn. Ye tempests, spare the slumbers of your Lord! Ye zephyrs, all your whisper'd sweets afford! Confess the God, that guides the rolling year; Heaven, do him homage; and thou, Earth, revere! Ye shepherds, monarchs, sages, hither bring Your hearts an offering, and adore your King! Pure be those hearts, and rich in faith and love; Join in his praise, the harmonious world above; To Bethlehem haste, rejoice in his repose, And praise him there for all that He bestows! Man, busy Man, alas! can ill afford To obey the summons, and attend the Lord; Perverted reason revels and runs wild, By glittering shows of pomp and wealth beguiled, And blind to genuine excellence and grace, Finds not her author in so mean a place. Ye unbelieving! learn a wiser part, Distrust your erring sense, and search your heart; There, soon ye shall perceive a kindling flame Glow for that infant God, from whom it came; Resist not, quench not, that divine desire, Melt all your adamant in heavenly fire! Not so will I requite thee, gentle Love! Yielding and soft this heart shall ever prove; And every heart beneath thy power should fall, Glad to submit, could mine contain them all. But I am poor; oblation I have none, None for a Saviour, but Himself alone: Whate'er I render Thee, from Thee it came; And, if I give my body to the flame, My patience, love, and energy divine Of heart and soul and spirit, all are thine. Ah, vain attempt to expunge the mighty score! The more I pay, I owe thee still the more. Upon my meanness, poverty, and guilt, The trophy of thy glory shall be built; My self-disdain shall be the unshaken base, And my deformity its fairest grace; For destitute of good and rich in ill, Must be my state and my description still. And do I grieve at such an humbling lot? Nay, but I cherish and enjoy the thought. Vain pageantry and pomp of earth, adieu! I have no wish, no memory for you; The more I feel my misery, I adore The sacred Inmate of my soul the more; Rich in his love, I feel my noblest pride Spring from the sense of having nought beside. In Thee I find wealth, comfort, virtue, might; My wanderings prove Thy wisdom infinite; All that I have I give thee; and then see All contrarieties unite in thee; For Thou hast join'd them, taking up our woe, And pouring out thy bliss on worms below, By filling with thy grace and love divine A gulf of evil in this heart of mine. This is, indeed, to bid the valleys rise, And the hills sink,—'tis matching Earth and Skies! I feel my weakness, thank thee, and deplore An aching heart, that throbs to thank thee more; The more I love thee, I the more reprove A soul so lifeless, and so slow to love; Till, on a deluge of thy mercy toss'd, I plunge into that sea, and there am lost. GOD NEITHER KNOWN NOR LOVED BY THE WORLD. Ye Linnets, let us try, beneath this grove, Which shall be loudest in our Maker's praise! In quest of some forlorn retreat I rove, For all the world is blind, and wanders from his ways. That God alone should prop the sinking soul, Fills them with rage against his empire now: I traverse earth in vain from pole to pole, To seek one simple heart, set free from all below. They speak of love, yet little feel its sway, While in their bosoms many an idol lurks; Their base desires, well satisfied, obey, Leave the Creator's hand, and lean upon his works. 'Tis therefore I can dwell with man no more; Your fellowship, ye warblers! suits me best: Pure love has lost its price, though prized of yore, Profaned by modern tongues, and slighted as a jest. My God, who form'd you for his praise alone, Beholds his purpose well fulfill'd in you; Come, let us join the choir before his throne, Partaking in his praise with spirits just and true! Yes, I will always love; and, as I ought, Tune to the praise of Love my ceaseless voice; Preferring Love too vast for human thought, In spite of erring men, who cavil at my choice. Why have I not a thousand thousand hearts, Lord of my soul! that they might all be thine? If thou approve,—the zeal thy smile imparts, How should it ever fail! can such a fire decline? Love pure and holy, is a deathless fire; Its object heavenly, it must ever blaze: Eternal love a God must needs inspire, When once he wins the heart, and fits it for his praise. Self-love dismiss'd,—'tis then we live indeed,— In her embrace, death, only death is found: Come, then, one noble effort, and succeed, Cast off the chain of self with which thy soul is bound! Oh! I could cry, that all the world might hear, Ye self-tormentors, love your God alone; Let his unequall'd excellence be dear, Dear to your inmost souls, and make him all your own! They hear me not.—Alas! how fond to rove In endless chase of folly's specious lure! 'Tis here alone, beneath this shady grove, I taste the sweets of truth,—here only am secure. THE SWALLOW. I am fond of the swallow;—I learn from her flight, Had I skill to improve it, a lesson of love: How seldom on earth do we see her alight! She dwells in the skies, she is ever above. It is on the wing that she takes her repose, Suspended and poised in the regions of air; 'Tis not in our fields that her sustenance grows, It is wing'd like herself, 'tis ethereal fare. She comes in the spring, all the summer she stays, And, dreading the cold, still follows the sun;— So, true to our Love, we should covet his rays, And the place where he shines not, immediately shun. Our light should be Love, and our nourishment prayer; It is dangerous food that we find upon earth: The fruit of this world is beset with a snare, In itself it is hurtful, as vile in its birth. 'Tis rarely, if ever, she settles below, And only when building a nest for her young; Were it not for her brood, she would never bestow A thought upon any thing filthy as dung. Let us leave it ourselves ('tis a mortal abode,) To bask every moment in infinite Love; Let us fly the dark winter, and follow the road That leads to the dayspring appearing above. THE TRIUMPH OF HEAVENLY LOVE DESIRED. Ah! reign, wherever man is found, My Spouse, beloved and divine! Then I am rich, and I abound, When every human heart is thine. A thousand sorrows pierce my soul, To think that all are not thine own: Ah! be adored from pole to pole; Where is thy zeal? arise; be known! All hearts are cold, in every place, Yet earthly good with warmth pursue; Dissolve them with a flash of grace, Thaw these of ice, and give us new! A FIGURATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE OF DIVINE LOVE, IN BRINGING A SOUL TO THE POINT OF SELF-RENUNCIATION AND ABSOLUTE ACQUIESCENCE. 'Twas my purpose on a day, To embark and sail away; As I climb'd the vessel's side, Love was sporting in the tide; “Come,” he said, “ascend! make haste, Launch into the boundless waste.” Many mariners were there, Having each his separate care; They that row'd us held their eyes Fix'd upon the starry skies; Others steer'd, or turn'd the sails To receive the shifting gales. Love, with power divine supplied, Suddenly my courage tried; In a moment it was night, Ship and skies were out of sight; On the briny wave I lay, Floating rushes all my stay. Did I with resentment burn At this unexpected turn? Did I wish myself on shore, Never to forsake it more? No:—“My soul,” I cried, “be still! If I must be lost, I will.” Next he hasten'd to convey Both my frail supports away; Seized my rushes; bade the waves Yawn into a thousand graves: Down I went, and sunk as lead, Ocean closing o'er my head. Still, however, life was safe; And I saw him turn and laugh: “Friend,” he cried, “adieu! lie low, While the wintry storms shall blow; When the spring has calm'd the main, You shall rise and float again.” Soon I saw him, with dismay, Spread his plumes and soar away; Now I mark his rapid flight, Now he leaves my aching sight; He is gone whom I adore, 'Tis in vain to seek him more. How I trembled then and fear'd, When my love had disappear'd! “Wilt thou leave me thus,” I cried, “Whelm'd beneath the rolling tide?” Vain attempt to reach his ear! Love was gone, and would not hear. Ah! return, and love me still; See me subject to thy will! Frown with wrath, or smile with grace, Only let me see thy face! Evil I have none to fear, All is good, if Thou art near. Yet he leaves me,—cruel fate! Leaves me in my lost estate! Have I sinn'd? Oh say wherein? Tell me, and forgive my sin! King and Lord, whom I adore, Shall I see thy face no more? Be not angry; I resign, Henceforth, all my will to thine: I consent that thou depart, Though thine absence breaks my heart; Go then, and for ever too; All is right that thou wilt do. This was just what Love intended, He was now no more offended; Soon as I became a child, Love return'd to me and smiled: Never strife shall more betide 'Twixt the Bridegroom and his Bride. A CHILD OF GOD LONGING TO SEE HIM BELOVED. There's not an echo round me, But I am glad should learn How pure a fire has found me, The love with which I burn. For none attends with pleasure To what I would reveal; They slight me out of measure, And laugh at all I feel. The rocks receive less proudly The story of my flame; When I approach, they loudly Reverberate his name. I speak to them of sadness, And comforts at a stand; They bid me look for gladness, And better days at hand. Far from all habitation, I heard a happy sound, Big with the consolation, That I have often found; I said, “My lot is sorrow, My grief has no alloy;” The rocks replied—“To-morrow, To-morrow brings thee joy.” These sweet and secret tidings, What bliss it is to hear! For, spite of all my chidings, My weakness and my fear, No sooner I receive them, Than I forget my pain, And happy to believe them, I love as much again. I fly to scenes romantic, Where never men resort; For in an age so frantic Impiety is sport; For riot and confusion They barter things above, Condemning, as delusion, The joy of perfect love. In this sequester'd corner, None hears what I express; Deliver'd from the scorner, What peace do I possess! Beneath the boughs reclining, Or roving o'er the wild, I live as undesigning, And harmless as a child. No troubles here surprise me; I innocently play, While Providence supplies me, And guards me all the day: My dear and kind defender Preserves me safely here, From men of pomp and splendour, Who fill a child with fear. ASPIRATIONS OF THE SOUL AFTER GOD. My Spouse! in whose presence I live, Sole object of all my desires, Who know'st what a flame I conceive, And canst easily double its fires; How pleasant is all that I meet! From fear of adversity free, I find even sorrow made sweet; Because 'tis assign'd me by Thee. Transported I see thee display Thy riches and glory divine; I have only my life to repay, Take what I would gladly resign. Thy will is the treasure I seek, For thou art as faithful as strong; There let me obedient and meek, Repose myself all the day long. My spirit and faculties fail; Oh finish what love has begun! Destroy what is sinful and frail, And dwell in the soul thou hast won! Dear theme of my wonder and praise, I cry, who is worthy as Thou! I can only be silent and gaze: 'Tis all that is left to me now. Oh glory in which I am lost, Too deep for the plummet of thought; On an ocean of Deity toss'd, I am swallow'd, I sink into nought. Yet lost and absorb'd as I seem, I chant to the praise of my king; And, though overwhelm'd by the theme, Am happy whenever I sing. GRATITUDE AND LOVE TO GOD. All are indebted much to thee, But I far more than all, From many a deadly snare set free, And raised from many a fall. Overwhelm me, from above, Daily, with thy boundless love! What bonds of gratitude I feel No language can declare; Beneath the oppressive weight I reel, 'Tis more than I can bear: When shall I that blessing prove, To return thee Love for Love? Spirit of Charity, dispense Thy grace to every heart; Expel all other spirits thence, Drive self from every part; Charity divine, draw nigh, Break the chains in which we lie! All selfish souls, whate'er they feign, Have still a slavish lot; They boast of liberty in vain, Of Love, and feel it not. He whose bosom glows with Thee, He, and he alone, is free. Oh blessedness, all bliss above, When thy pure fires prevail! Love only teaches what is Love; All other lessons fail: We learn its name, but not its powers, Experience only makes it ours. HAPPY SOLITUDE—UNHAPPY MEN. My heart is easy, and my burden light; I smile, though sad, when Thou art in my sight: The more my woes in secret I deplore, I taste thy goodness and I love the more. There, while a solemn stillness reigns around, Faith, Love, and Hope within my soul abound; And while the world suppose me lost in care, The joys of angels, unperceived, I share. Thy creatures wrong thee, O thou sovereign Good! Thou art not loved, because not understood; This grieves me most, that vain pursuits beguile Ungrateful men, regardless of thy smile. Frail beauty and false honour are adored; While Thee they scorn, and trifle with thy Word; Pass, unconcern'd, a Saviour's sorrows by; And hunt their ruin with a zeal to die. LIVING WATER. The fountain in its source No drought of summer fears; The farther it pursues its course, The nobler it appears. But shallow cisterns yield A scanty short supply; The morning sees them amply fill'd, At evening they are dry. TRUTH AND DIVINE LOVE REJECTED BY THE WORLD. O love, of pure and heavenly birth! O simple Truth, scarce known on earth! Whom men resist with stubborn will; And, more perverse and daring still, Smother and quench, with reasonings vain, While Error and Deception reign. Whence comes it, that, your power the same As His on high, from whence you came, Ye rarely find a listening ear, Or heart that makes you welcome here?— Because ye bring reproach and pain, Where'er ye visit, in your train. The world is proud, and cannot bear The scorn and calumny ye share; The praise of men the mark they mean, They fly the place where ye are seen; Pure Love, with scandal in the rear, Suits not the vain, it costs too dear. Then, let the price be what it may, Though poor, I am prepared to pay; Come shame, come sorrow; spite of tears, Weakness, and heart-oppressing fears; One soul, at least, shall not repine, To give you room; come, reign in mine! DIVINE JUSTICE AMIABLE. Thou hast no lightnings, O thou just! Or I their force should know; And if thou strike me into dust, My soul approves the blow. The heart that values less its ease Than it adores thy ways, In thine avenging anger sees A subject of its praise. Pleased I could lie, conceal'd and lost, In shades of central night; Not to avoid thy wrath, thou know'st, But lest I grieve thy sight. Smite me, O Thou, whom I provoke! And I will love thee still; The well-deserved and righteous stroke Shall please me, though it kill. Am I not worthy to sustain The worst thou canst devise? And dare I seek thy throne again, And meet thy sacred eyes? Far from afflicting, Thou art kind; And in my saddest hours, An unction of thy grace I find, Pervading all my powers. Alas! Thou sparest me yet again; And when thy wrath should move, Too gentle to endure my pain, Thou sooth'st me with thy love. I have no punishment to fear; But, ah! that smile from Thee Imparts a pang far more severe Than woe itself would be. THE SOUL THAT LOVES GOD FINDS HIM EVERY WHERE. Oh Thou, by long experience tried, Near whom no grief can long abide; My Love! how full of sweet content I pass my years of banishment! All scenes alike engaging prove To souls impress'd with sacred Love! Where'er they dwell, they dwell in Thee; In heaven, in earth, or on the sea. To me remains nor place nor time; My country is in every clime; I can be calm and free from care On any shore, since God is there. While place we seek, or place we shun, The soul finds happiness in none; But with a God to guide our way, 'Tis equal joy to go or stay. Could I be cast where Thou art not, That were indeed a dreadful lot; But regions none remote I call, Secure of finding God in all. My country, Lord, art Thou alone; Nor other can I claim or own; The point where all my wishes meet; My law, my love; life's only sweet! I hold by nothing here below; Appoint my journey, and I go; Though pierced by scorn, oppress'd by pride, I feel thee good, feel nought beside. No frowns of men can hurtful prove To souls on fire with heavenly Love; Though men and devils both condemn, No gloomy days arise from them. Ah then! to His embrace repair; My soul, thou art no stranger there; There Love divine shall be thy guard, And peace and safety thy reward. THE TESTIMONY OF DIVINE ADOPTION. How happy are the new-born race; Partakers of adopting grace, How pure the bliss they share! Hid from the world and all its eyes, Within their heart the blessing lies, And conscience feels it there. The moment we believe, 'tis ours; And if we love with all our powers The God from whom it came, And if we serve with hearts sincere, 'Tis still discernible and clear, An undisputed claim. But, ah! if foul and wilful sin Stain and dishonour us within, Farewell the joy we knew; Again the slaves of Nature's sway, In labyrinths of our own we stray, Without a guide or clue. The chaste and pure who fear to grieve The gracious Spirit they receive, His work distinctly trace; And, strong in undissembling love, Boldly assert and clearly prove Their hearts his dwelling place. Oh messenger of dear delight, Whose voice dispels the deepest night, Sweet peace-proclaiming Dove! With thee at hand, to soothe our pains, No wish unsatisfied remains, No task but that of Love. 'Tis Love unites what Sin divides; The centre, where all bliss resides; To which the soul once brought, Reclining on the first great Cause, From his abounding sweetness draws Peace passing human thought. Sorrow foregoes its nature there, And life assumes a tranquil air, Divested of its woes; There sovereign goodness soothes the breast, Till then incapable of rest, In sacred sure repose. DIVINE LOVE ENDURES NO RIVAL. Love is the Lord whom I obey, Whose will transported I perform; The centre of my rest, my stay, Love's all in all to me, myself a worm. For uncreated charms I burn, Oppress'd by slavish fear no more; For One in whom I may discern, Even when he frowns, a sweetness I adore. He little loves Him who complains, And finds him rigorous and severe; His heart is sordid, and he feigns, Though loud in boasting of a soul sincere. Love causes grief, but 'tis to move And stimulate the slumbering mind; And he has never tasted love Who shuns a pang so graciously design'd. Sweet is the cross, above all sweets, To souls enamour'd with thy smiles; The keenest woe life ever meets, Love strips of all its terrors, and beguiles. 'Tis just that God should not be dear Where self engrosses all the thought, And groans and murmurs make it clear, Whatever else is loved, the Lord is not. The love of Thee flows just as much As that of ebbing self subsides; Our hearts, their scantiness is such, Bear not the conflict of two rival tides. Both cannot govern in one soul; Then let self-love be dispossess'd; The Love of God deserves the whole, And will not dwell with so despised a guest. SELF-DIFFIDENCE. Source of love, and light of day, Tear me from myself away; Every view and thought of mine Cast into the mould of thine; Teach, O teach this faithless heart A consistent constant part; Or, if it must live to grow More rebellious, break it now! Is it thus that I requite Grace and goodness infinite? Every trace of every boon Cancell'd and erased so soon! Can I grieve Thee, whom I love; Thee, in whom I live and move? If my sorrow touch thee still, Save me from so great an ill! Oh! the oppressive, irksome weight Felt in an uncertain state; Comfort, peace, and rest adieu, Should I prove at last untrue! Still I choose thee, follow still Every notice of thy will; But, unstable, strangely weak, Still let slip the good I seek. Self-confiding wretch, I thought I could serve thee as I ought, Win thee, and deserve to feel All the Love thou canst reveal! Trusting self, a bruised reed, Is to be deceived indeed. Save me from this harm and loss, Lest my gold turn all to dross! Self is earthly—Faith alone Makes an unseen world our own; Faith relinquish'd, how we roam, Feel our way, and leave our home! Spurious gems our hopes entice, While we scorn the pearl of price; And, preferring servants' pay, Cast the children's bread away. THE ACQUIESCENCE OF PURE LOVE. Love! if thy destined sacrifice am I, Come slay thy victim, and prepare thy fires; Plunged in thy depths of mercy, let me die The death which every soul that lives desires! I watch my hours, and see them fleet away; The time is long that I have languish'd here; Yet all my thoughts thy purposes obey, With no reluctance, cheerful and sincere. To me 'tis equal, whether Love ordain My life or death, appoint me pain or ease; My soul perceives no real ill in pain; In ease or health no real good she sees. One Good she covets, and that Good alone; To choose thy will, from selfish bias free; And to prefer a cottage to a throne, And grief to comfort, if it pleases thee. That we should bear the cross is thy command, Die to the world, and live to self no more; Suffer, unmoved, beneath the rudest hand, As pleased when shipwreck'd as when safe on shore. REPOSE IN GOD. Blest! who, far from all mankind, This world's shadows left behind, Hears from Heaven a gentle strain Whispering Love, and loves again. Blest! who, free from self-esteem, Dives into the great Supreme, All desire beside discards, Joys inferior none regards. Blest! who in thy bosom seeks Rest that nothing earthly breaks, Dead to self and worldly things, Lost in thee, thou King of kings! Ye that know my secret fire, Softly speak and soon retire; Favour my divine repose, Spare the sleep a God bestows. GLORY TO GOD ALONE. Oh loved! but not enough—though dearer far Than self and its most loved enjoyments are; None duly loves thee, but who, nobly free From sensual objects, finds his all in Thee. Glory of God! thou stranger here below, Whom man nor knows, nor feels a wish to know; Our Faith and Reason are both shock'd to find Man in the post of honour—Thee behind. Reason exclaims—“Let every creature fall, Ashamed, abased, before the Lord of all;” And Faith, o'erwhelm'd with such a dazzling blaze, Feebly describes the beauty she surveys. Yet man, dim-sighted man, and rash as blind, Deaf to the dictates of his better mind, In frantic competition dares the skies, And claims precedence of the only wise. Oh lost in vanity, till once self-known! Nothing is great, or good, but God alone; When thou shalt stand before his aweful face, Then, at the last, thy pride shall know His place. Glorious, Almighty, First, and without end! When wilt thou melt the mountains and descend? When wilt thou shoot abroad thy conquering rays, And teach these atoms thou hast made, thy praise? Thy Glory is the sweetest heaven I feel; And, if I seek it with too fierce a zeal, Thy Love, triumphant o'er a selfish will, Taught me the passion, and inspires it still. My reason, all my faculties, unite, To make thy Glory their supreme delight; Forbid it, fountain of my brightest days, That I should rob thee, and usurp thy praise! My soul! rest happy in thy low estate, Nor hope, nor wish, to be esteem'd or great; To take the impression of a will divine, Be that thy glory, and those riches thine. Confess Him righteous in his just decrees, Love what he loves, and let his pleasure please; Die daily; from the touch of sin recede; Then thou hast crown'd him, and he reigns indeed. SELF-LOVE AND TRUTH INCOMPATIBLE. From thorny wilds a monster came, That fill'd my soul with fear and shame; The birds, forgetful of their mirth, Droop'd at the sight, and fell to earth; When thus a sage address'd mine ear, Himself unconscious of a fear. “Whence all this terror and surprise, Distracted looks, and streaming eyes? Far from the world and its affairs, The joy it boasts, the pain it shares, Surrender, without guile or art, To God, an undivided heart; The savage form, so fear'd before, Shall scare your trembling soul no more; For loathsome as the sight may be, 'Tis but the Love of self you see. Fix all your love on God alone, Choose but His will, and hate your own, No fear shall in your path be found, The dreary waste shall bloom around, And you through all your happy days, Shall bless his name, and sing his praise.” Oh lovely solitude, how sweet The silence of this calm retreat! Here Truth, the fair whom I pursue, Gives all her beauty to my view; The simple, unadorn'd display Charms every pain and fear away. O Truth, whom millions proudly slight; O Truth, my treasure and delight; Accept this tribute to thy name, And this poor heart from which it came! THE LOVE OF GOD, THE END OF LIFE. Since life in sorrow must be spent, So be it—I am well content, And meekly wait my last remove, Seeking only growth in love. No bliss I seek, but to fulfil In life, in death, thy lovely will; No succours in my woes I want, Save what Thou art pleased to grant. Our days are number'd, let us spare Our anxious hearts a needless care: 'Tis thine to number out our days; Ours to give them to thy praise. Love is our only business here, Love, simple, constant, and sincere; O blessed days, thy servants see! Spent, O Lord! in pleasing Thee. LOVE FAITHFUL IN THE ABSENCE OF THE BELOVED. In vain ye woo me to your harmless joys, Ye pleasant bowers, remote from strife and noise; Your shades, the witnesses of many a vow Breathed forth in happier days, are irksome now; Denied that smile 'twas once my heaven to see, Such scenes, such pleasures, are all past with me. In vain He leaves me, I shall love him still; And though I mourn, not murmur at his will; I have no cause—an object all divine Might well grow weary of a soul like mine; Yet pity me, great God! forlorn, alone, Heartless and hopeless, Life and Love all gone. LOVE PURE AND FERVENT. Jealous, and with love o'erflowing, God demands a fervent heart; Grace and bounty still bestowing, Calls us to a grateful part. Oh, then, with supreme affection His paternal Will regard! If it cost us some dejection, Every sigh has its reward. Perfect Love has power to soften Cares that might our peace destroy; Nay, does more—transforms them often, Changing sorrow into joy. Sovereign Love appoints the measure, And the number of our pains; And is pleased when we find pleasure In the trials he ordains. THE ENTIRE SURRENDER. Peace has unveil'd her smiling face, And woos thy soul to her embrace, Enjoy'd with ease, if thou refrain From earthly love, else sought in vain; She dwells with all who Truth prefer, But seeks not them who seek not her. Yield to the Lord, with simple heart, All that thou hast, and all thou art; Renounce all strength but strength divine, And peace shall be for ever thine: Behold the path which I have trod, My path, till I go home to God. THE PERFECT SACRIFICE. I place an offering at thy shrine, From taint and blemish clear, Simple and pure in its design, Of all that I hold dear. I yield thee back thy gifts again, Thy gifts which most I prize; Desirous only to retain The notice of thine eyes. But if, by thine adored decree, That blessing be denied; Resign'd and unreluctant, see My every wish subside. Thy will in all things I approve, Exalted or cast down! Thy will in every state I love, And even in thy frown. GOD HIDES HIS PEOPLE. To lay the soul that loves him low, Becomes the Only-wise: To hide, beneath a veil of woe, The children of the skies. Man, though a worm, would yet be great; Though feeble, would seem strong; Assumes an independent state, By sacrilege and wrong. Strange the reverse, which, once abased, The haughty creature proves! He feels his soul a barren waste, Nor dares affirm he loves. Scorn'd by the thoughtless and the vain, To God he presses near; Superior to the world's disdain, And happy in it's sneer. Oh welcome, in his heart he says, Humility and shame! Farewell the wish for human praise, The music of a name! But will not scandal mar the good That I might else perform? And can God work it, if he would, By so despised a worm? Ah, vainly anxious!—leave the Lord To rule thee, and dispose; Sweet is the mandate of his word, And gracious all He does. He draws from human littleness His grandeur and renown; And generous hearts with joy confess The triumph all his own. Down then with self-exalting thoughts; Thy faith and hope employ, To welcome all that he allots, And suffer shame with joy. No longer, then, thou wilt encroach On his eternal right; And He shall smile at thy approach, And make thee his delight. THE SECRETS OF DIVINE LOVE ARE TO BE KEPT. Sun! stay thy course, this moment stay— Suspend the o'erflowing tide of day, Divulge not such a love as mine, Ah! hide the mystery divine; Lest man, who deems my glory shame, Should learn the secret of my flame. O Night! propitious to my views, Thy sable awning wide diffuse; Conceal alike my joy and pain, Nor draw thy curtain back again, Though Morning, by the tears she shows, Seems to participate my woes. Ye Stars! whose faint and feeble fires Express my languishing desires, Whose slender beams pervade the skies As silent as my secret sighs, Those emanations of a soul, That darts her fires beyond the pole; Your rays, that scarce assist the sight, That pierce, but not displace the night, That shine indeed, but nothing show Of all those various scenes below, Bring no disturbance, rather prove Incentives to a sacred love. Thou Moon! whose never failing course Bespeaks a providential force, Go, tell the tidings of my flame To him who calls the stars by name, Whose absence kills, whose presence cheers, Who blots or brightens all my years. While, in the blue abyss of space, Thine orb performs its rapid race, Still whisper in his listening ears The language of my sighs and tears; Tell him, I seek him, far below, Lost in a wilderness of woe. Ye thought-composing, silent Hours, Diffusing peace o'er all my powers, Friends of the pensive! who conceal In darkest shades the flames I feel; To you I trust, and safely may, The love that wastes my strength away. In sylvan scenes and caverns rude, I taste the sweets of solitude; Retired indeed, but not alone, I share them with a Spouse unknown, Who hides me here, from envious eyes, From all intrusion and surprise. Imbowering Shades, and Dens profound! Where echo rolls the voice around; Mountains! whose elevated heads, A moist and misty veil o'erspreads; Disclose a solitary bride To him I love—to none beside. Ye Rills! that, murmuring all the way, Among the polish'd pebbles stray, Creep silently along the ground, Lest, drawn by that harmonious sound, Some wanderer, whom I would not meet, Should stumble on my loved retreat. Enamel'd Meads, and Hillocks green, And Streams that water all the scene! Ye Torrents, loud in distant ears! Ye Fountains, that receive my tears! Ah! still conceal, with caution due, A charge I trust with none but you. If, when my pain and grief increase, I seem to enjoy the sweetest peace, It is because I find so fair The charming object of my care, That I can sport and pleasure make Of torment suffer'd for his sake. Ye Meads and Groves, unconscious things! Ye know not whence my pleasure springs; Ye know not, and ye cannot know, The source from which my sorrows flow: The dear sole Cause of all I feel,— He knows, and understands them well. Ye Deserts! where the wild beasts rove, Scenes sacred to my hours of love; Ye Forests! in whose shades I stray, Benighted under burning day; Ah! whisper not how blest am I, Nor while I live, nor when I die. Ye Lambs! who sport beneath these shades, And bound along the mossy glades, Be taught a salutary fear, And cease to bleat when I am near: The wolf may hear your harmless cry, Whom ye should dread as much as I. How calm, amid these scenes, my mind! How perfect is the peace I find! Oh hush, be still, my every part, My tongue, my pulse, my beating heart! That Love, aspiring to its cause, May suffer not a moment's pause. Ye swift-finn'd nations, that abide In seas as fathomless as wide; And unsuspicious of a snare, Pursue at large your pleasures there: Poor sportive fools! how soon does man Your heedless ignorance trepan! Away! dive deep into the brine, Where never yet sunk plummet-line; Trust me, the vast leviathan Is merciful, compared with man; Avoid his arts, forsake the beach, And never play within his reach! My soul her bondage ill endures; I pant for liberty like yours; I long for that immense profound, That knows no bottom, and no bound; Lost in infinity, to prove The incomprehensible of Love. Ye Birds! that lessen as ye fly, And vanish in the distant sky; To whom yon airy waste belongs, Resounding with your cheerful songs; Haste to escape from human sight! Fear less the vulture and the kite. How blest, and how secure am I, When quitting earth, I soar on high; When lost, like you I disappear, And float in a sublimer sphere! Whence, falling within human view, I am ensnared, and caught like you. Omniscient God, whose notice deigns To try the heart and search the reins, Compassionate the numerous woes, I dare not, even to thee, disclose; Oh save me from the cruel hands Of men, who fear not thy commands! Love, all-subduing and divine, Care for a creature truly thine; Reign in a heart, disposed to own No sovereign but thyself alone; Cherish a bride who cannot rove, Nor quit Thee for a meaner love! THE VICISSITUDES EXPERIENCED IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE. I suffer fruitless anguish day by day, Each moment, as it passes, marks my pain; Scarce knowing whither, doubtfully I stray, And see no end of all that I sustain. The more I strive the more I am withstood; Anxiety increasing every hour, My spirit finds no rest, performs no good, And nought remains of all my former power. My peace of heart is fled, I know not where; My happy hours, like shadows, pass'd away; Their sweet remembrance doubles all my care, Night darker seems, succeeding such a day. Dear faded joys, and impotent regret, What profit is there in incessant tears? Oh Thou, whom once beheld, we ne'er forget, Reveal thy Love, and banish all my fears! Alas! He flies me—treats me as his foe, Views not my sorrows, hears not when I plead; Woe such as mine, despised, neglected woe, Unless it shortens life, is vain indeed. Pierced with a thousand wounds, I yet survive; My pangs are keen, but no complaint transpires; And while in terrors of thy wrath I live, Hell seems to lose its less tremendous fires. Has Hell a pain I would not gladly bear, So thy severe displeasure might subside? Hopeless of ease, I seem already there, My life extinguish'd, and yet death denied. Is this the joy so promised?—this the love, The unchanging love, so sworn in better days? Ah! dangerous glories! shown me, but to prove How lovely Thou, and I how rash to gaze. Why did I see them? had I still remain'd Untaught, still ignorant how fair thou art, My humbler wishes I had soon obtain'd, Nor known the torments of a doubting heart. Deprived of all, yet feeling no desires, Whence then, I cry, the pangs that I sustain? Dubious and uninform'd, my soul inquires, Ought she to cherish, or shake off her pain? Suffering, I suffer not; sincerely love, Yet feel no touch of that enlivening flame; As chance inclines me, unconcern'd I move, All times, and all events, to me the same. I search my heart, and not a wish is there, But burns with zeal that hated self may fall; Such is the sad disquietude I share, A sea of doubts, and self the source of all. I ask not life, nor do I wish to die; And if thine hand accomplish not my cure, I would not purchase with a single sigh, A free discharge from all that I endure. I groan in chains, yet want not a release; Am sick, and know not the distemper'd part; Am just as void of purpose as of peace; Have neither plan, nor fear, nor hope, nor heart. My claim to life, though sought with earnest care, No light within me or without me shows; Once I had faith, but now in self-despair Find my chief cordial and my best repose. My soul is a forgotten thing; she sinks, Sinks and is lost without a wish to rise; Feels an indifference she abhors, and thinks Her name erased for ever from the skies. Language affords not my distress a name,— Yet is it real, and no sickly dream; 'Tis Love inflicts it; though to feel that flame Is all I know of happiness supreme. When Love departs, a chaos wide and vast, And dark as Hell is open'd in the soul; When Love returns, the gloomy scene is past, No tempests shake her, and no fears controul. Then tell me why these ages of delay? Oh Love, all excellent, once more appear, Disperse the shades, and snatch me into day, From this abyss of night, these floods of fear! No—Love is angry, will not now endure A sigh of mine, or suffer a complaint; He smites me, wounds me, and withholds the cure; Exhausts my powers, and leaves me sick and faint. He wounds, and hides the hand that gave the blow; He flies, he reappears, and wounds again;— Was ever heart that loved thee treated so? Yet I adore thee, though it seem in vain. And wilt thou leave me, whom, when lost and blind, Thou didst distinguish and vouchsafe to choose, Before thy laws were written in my mind, While yet the world had all my thoughts and views? Now leave me? when, enamour'd of thy laws, I make thy glory my supreme delight; Now blot me from thy register, and cause A faithful soul to perish from thy sight? What can have caused the change which I deplore? Is it to prove me, if my heart be true? Permit me then, while prostrate I adore, To draw, and place it's picture in thy view. 'Tis thine without reserve, most simply thine; So given to thee, that it is not my own; A willing captive of thy grace divine; And loves, and seeks thee, for Thyself alone. Pain cannot move it, danger cannot scare; Pleasure and wealth, in its esteem, are dust; It loves thee, even when least inclined to spare Its tenderest feelings, and avows thee just. Tis all thine own; my spirit is so too, An undivided offering at thy shrine; It seeks thy glory with no double view, Thy glory, with no secret bent to mine. Love, holy Love! and art thou not severe, To slight me, thus devoted and thus fix'd? Mine is an everlasting ardour, clear From all self-bias, generous and unmix'd. But I am silent, seeing what I see,— And fear, with cause, that I am self-deceived; Not even my faith is from suspicion free, And that I love, seems not to be believed. Live Thou, and reign for ever, glorious Lord! My last, least offering, I present thee now;— Renounce me, leave me, and be still adored! Slay me, my God, and I applaud the blow. WATCHING UNTO GOD IN THE NIGHT SEASON. Sleep at last has fled these eyes, Nor do I regret his flight, More alert my spirits rise, And my heart is free and light. Nature silent all around, Not a single witness near; God as soon as sought is found, And the flame of love burns clear. Interruption, all day long, Checks the current of my joys; Creatures press me with a throng, And perplex me with their noise. Undisturb'd I muse all night, On the first Eternal Fair; Nothing there obstructs delight, Love is renovated there. Life, with its perpetual stir, Proves a foe to Love and me; Fresh entanglements occur,— Comes the night, and sets me free. Never more, sweet sleep, suspend My enjoyments, always new: Leave me to possess my friend; Other eyes and hearts subdue. Hush the world, that I may wake To the taste of pure delights; Oh the pleasures I partake,— God the partner of my nights! David, for the selfsame cause, Night preferr'd to busy day: Hearts whom heavenly beauty draws Wish the glaring sun away. Sleep, self-lovers is for you;— Souls that love celestial know, Fairer scenes by night can view Than the sun could ever show. ON THE SAME [WATCHING UNTO GOD IN THE NIGHT SEASON]. Season of my purest pleasure, Sealer of observing eyes! When, in larger, freer measure, I can commune with the skies; While, beneath thy shade extended, Weary man forgets his woes; I, my daily trouble ended, Find, in watching, my repose. Silence all around prevailing, Nature hush'd in slumber sweet, No rude noise mine ears assailing, Now my God and I can meet: Universal nature slumbers, And my soul partakes the calm, Breathes her ardour out in numbers, Plaintive song or lofty psalm. Now my passion, pure and holy, Shines and burns without restraint, Which the day's fatigue and folly Cause to languish, dim and faint: Charming hours of relaxation! How I dread the ascending sun! Surely, idle conversation Is an evil, match'd by none. Worldly prate and babble hurt me; Unintelligible prove; Neither teach me nor divert me; I have ears for none but Love. Me they rude esteem, and foolish, Hearing my absurd replies; I have neither art's fine polish, Nor the knowledge of the wise. Simple souls, and unpolluted By conversing with the great, Have a mind and taste ill suited To their dignity and state; All their talking, reading, writing, Are but talents misapplied; Infants' prattle I delight in, Nothing human choose beside. 'Tis the secret fear of sinning Checks my tongue, or I should say, When I see the night beginning, I am glad of parting day: Love this gentle admonition Whispers soft within my breast; “Choice befits not thy condition, Acquiescence suits thee best.” Henceforth, the repose and pleasure Night affords me I resign; And thy will shall be the measure, Wisdom infinite! of mine: Wishing is but Inclination Quarreling with thy decrees; Wayward nature finds the occasion,— 'Tis her folly and disease. Night, with its sublime enjoyments, Now no longer will I choose; Nor the day, with its employments, Irksome as they seem, refuse; Lessons of a God's inspiring Neither time nor place impedes; From our wishing and desiring Our unhappiness proceeds. ON THE SAME [WATCHING UNTO GOD IN THE NIGHT SEASON]. Night! how I love thy silent shades, My spirits they compose; The bliss of heaven my soul pervades, In spite of all my woes. While sleep instils her poppy dews In every slumbering eye, I watch, to meditate and muse, In blest tranquillity. And when I feel a God immense Familiarly impart, With every proof he can dispense, His favour to my heart; My native meanness I lament, Though most divinely fill'd With all the ineffable content That Deity can yield. His purpose and his course he keeps; Treads all my reasonings down; Commands me out of nature's deeps, And hides me in his own. When in the dust, its proper place, Our pride of heart we lay, 'Tis then a deluge of his grace Bears all our sins away. Thou whom I serve, and whose I am, Whose influence from on high Refines, and still refines my flame, And makes my fetters fly; How wretched is the creature's state Who thwarts thy gracious power; Crush'd under sin's enormous weight, Increasing every hour! The night, when pass'd entire with thee, How luminous and clear! Then sleep has no delights for me, Lest thou shouldst disappear. My Saviour! occupy me still In this secure recess; Let Reason slumber if she will, My joy shall not be less: Let Reason slumber out the night; But if thou deign to make My soul the abode of Truth and Light, Ah, keep my heart awake! THE JOY OF THE CROSS. Long plunged in sorrow, I resign My soul to that dear hand of thine, Without reserve or fear; That hand shall wipe my streaming eyes, Or into smiles of glad surprise Transform the falling tear. My sole possession is thy love; In earth beneath, or heaven above, I have no other store; And though with fervent suit I pray, And importune thee night and day, I ask thee nothing more. My rapid hours pursue the course Prescribed them by love's sweetest force; And I thy sovereign will, Without a wish to escape my doom, Though still a sufferer from the womb, And doom'd to suffer still. By thy command, where'er I stray, Sorrow attends me all my way, A never failing friend; And if my sufferings may augment Thy praise, behold me well content,— Let Sorrow still attend! It costs me no regret, that she, Who follow'd Christ, should follow me; And though, where'er she goes, Thorns spring spontaneous at her feet, I love her, and extract a sweet From all my bitter woes. Adieu! ye vain delights of earth; Insipid sports, and childish mirth, I taste no sweets in you; Unknown delights are in the Cross, All joy beside to me is dross; And Jesus thought so too. The Cross! Oh ravishment and bliss,— How grateful even its anguish is, Its bitterness how sweet! There every sense, and all the mind, In all her faculties refined, Tastes happiness complete. Souls once enabled to disdain Base sublunary joys, maintain Their dignity secure; The fever of desire is pass'd, And love has all its genuine taste, Is delicate and pure. Self-love no grace in sorrow sees, Consults her own peculiar ease; 'Tis all the bliss she knows: But nobler aims true Love employ; In self-denial is her joy, In suffering her repose. Sorrow and Love go side by side; Nor height nor depth can e'er divide Their heaven-appointed bands; Those dear associates still are one, Nor till the race of life is run Disjoin their wedded hands. Jesus, avenger of our fall, Thou faithful lover, above all The Cross has ever borne! Oh tell me,—life is in thy voice,— How much afflictions were thy choice, And sloth and ease thy scorn! Thy choice and mine shall be the same, Inspirer of that holy flame Which must for ever blaze! To take the Cross and follow thee, Where love and duty lead, shall be My portion and my praise. JOY IN MARTYRDOM. Sweet tenants of this grove, Who sing, without design, A song of artless love, In unison with mine: These echoing shades return Full many a note of ours, That wise ones cannot learn With all their boasted powers. O Thou! whose sacred charms These hearts so seldom love, Although thy beauty warms And blesses all above; How slow are human things To choose their happiest lot! All-glorious King of kings, Say why we love thee not? This heart, that cannot rest, Shall thine for ever prove; Though bleeding and distress'd, Yet joyful in thy love: 'Tis happy, though it breaks Beneath thy chastening hand; And speechless,—yet it speaks What thou canst understand. SIMPLE TRUST. Still, still, without ceasing, I feel it increasing, This fervour of holy desire; And often exclaim, Let me die in the flame Of a love that can never expire! Had I words to explain What she must sustain Who dies to the world and its ways: How joy and affright, Distress and delight, Alternately chequer her days. Thou, sweetly severe! I would make thee appear, In all thou art pleased to award, Not more in the sweet Than the bitter I meet, My tender and merciful Lord. This Faith, in the dark Pursuing its mark Through many sharp trials of Love, Is the sorrowful waste That is to be pass'd In the way to the Canaan above. THE NECESSITY OF SELF-ABASEMENT. Source of love, my brighter sun, Thou alone my comfort art; See, my race is almost run; Hast thou left this trembling heart? In my youth thy charming eyes Drew me from the ways of men; Then I drank unmingled joys; Frown of thine saw never then. Spouse of Christ was then my name; And devoted all to thee, Strangely jealous, I became Jealous of this Self in me. Thee to love, and none beside, Was my darling, sole employ; While alternately I died, Now of grief, and now of joy. Through the dark and silent night On thy radiant smiles I dwelt; And to see the dawning light Was the keenest pain I felt. Thou my gracious teacher wert; And thine eye, so close applied, While it watch'd thy pupil's heart, Seem'd to look at none beside. Conscious of no evil drift, This, I cried, is Love indeed!— 'Tis the Giver, not the Gift, Whence the joys I feel proceed. But soon humbled, and laid low, Stript of all thou hast conferr'd, Nothing left but sin and woe, I perceived how I had err'd. Oh the vain conceit of man, Dreaming of a good his own, Arrogating all he can, Though the Lord is good alone! He the graces thou hast wrought Makes subservient to his pride; Ignorant, that one such thought Passes all his sin beside. Such his folly,—proved, at last, By the loss of that repose Self-complacence cannot taste, Only Love Divine bestows. 'Tis by this reproof severe, And by this reproof alone, His defects at last appear, Man is to himself made known. Learn, all Earth! that feeble man, Sprung from this terrestrial clod, Nothing is, and nothing can; Life and power are all in God. LOVE INCREASED BY SUFFERING. “I love the Lord,” is still the strain This heart delights to sing; But I reply,—your thoughts are vain, Perhaps 'tis no such thing. Before the power of Love Divine Creation fades away; Till only God is seen to shine In all that we survey. In gulfs of aweful night we find The God of our desires; 'Tis there he stamps the yielding mind, And doubles all its fires. Flames of encircling love invest, And pierce it sweetly through; 'Tis fill'd with sacred joy, yet press'd With sacred sorrow too. Ah Love! my heart is in the right— Amidst a thousand woes, To thee, it's ever new delight, And all its peace it owes. Fresh causes of distress occur Where'er I look or move; The comforts I to all prefer Are solitude and love. Nor exile I, nor prison fear; Love makes my courage great; I find a Saviour every where, His grace in every state. Nor castle walls, nor dungeons deep, Exclude his quickening beams; There I can sit, and sing, and weep, And dwell on heavenly themes. There sorrow, for his sake, is found A joy beyond compare; There no presumptuous thoughts abound, No pride can enter there. A Saviour doubles all my joys, And sweetens all my pains, His strength in my defence employs, Consoles me and sustains. I fear no ill, resent no wrong, Nor feel a passion move, When malice whets her slanderous tongue; Such patience is in love. SCENES FAVOURABLE TO MEDITATION. Wilds horrid and dark with o'ershadowing trees, Rocks that ivy and briers infold, Scenes nature with dread and astonishment sees, But I with a pleasure untold; Though awefully silent, and shaggy, and rude, I am charm'd with the peace ye afford, Your shades are a temple where none will intrude, The abode of my Lover and Lord. I am sick of thy splendour, O Fountain of day, And here I am hid from its beams; Here safely contemplate a brighter display Of the noblest and holiest of themes. Ye Forests, that yield me my sweetest repose, Where stillness and solitude reign, To you I securely and boldly disclose The dear anguish of which I complain. Here, sweetly forgetting and wholly forgot By the world and its turbulent throng, The birds and the streams lend me many a note That aids meditation and song. Here, wandering in scenes that are sacred to night, Love wears me and wastes me away; And often the sun has spent much of his light Ere yet I perceive it is day. While a mantle of darkness envelopes the sphere, My sorrows are sadly rehearsed; To me the dark hours are all equally dear, And the last is as sweet as the first. Here I and the beasts of the deserts agree; Mankind are the wolves that I fear, They grudge me my natural right to be free, But nobody questions it here. Though little is found in this dreary abode That appetite wishes to find, My spirit is soothed by the presence of God, And appetite wholly resign'd. Ye desolate scenes, to your solitude led, My life I in praises employ, And scarce know the source of the tears that I shed, Proceed they from sorrow or joy. There's nothing I seem to have skill to discern; I feel out my way in the dark, Love reigns in my bosom, I constantly burn, Yet hardly distinguish the spark. I live, yet I seem to myself to be dead; Such a riddle is not to be found; I am nourish'd without knowing how I am fed, I have nothing, and yet I abound. Oh Love! who in darkness art pleased to abide Though dimly, yet surely I see That these contrarieties only reside In the soul that is chosen of thee. Ah send me not back to the race of mankind, Perversely by folly beguiled, For where, in the crowds I have left, shall I find The spirit and heart of a child? Here let me, though fix'd in a desert, be free; A little one whom they despise, Though lost to the world, if in union with Thee, Shall be holy and happy and wise. THE TASK.

I who lately sang Truth, Hope, and Charity, and touch'd with awe The solemn chords, and with a trembling hand, Escaped with pain from that adventurous flight, Now seek repose upon an humbler theme; The theme though humble, yet august and proud The occasion,—for the Fair commands the song. Time was when clothing, sumptuous or for use, Save their own painted skins, our sires had none. As yet black breeches were not, sattin smooth, Or velvet soft, or plush with shaggy pile. The hardy chief upon the rugged rock Wash'd by the sea, or on the gravelly bank Thrown up by wintry torrents roaring loud, Fearless of wrong, reposed his weary strength. Those barbarous ages past, succeeded next The birthday of invention, weak at first, Dull in design, and clumsy to perform. Joint-stools were then created; on three legs Upborne they stood,—three legs upholding firm A massy slab, in fashion square or round. On such a stool immortal Alfred sat, And sway'd the sceptre of his infant realms; And such in ancient halls and mansions drear May still be seen, but perforated sore And drill'd in holes the solid oak is found, By worms voracious eating through and through. At length a generation more refined Improved the simple plan, made three legs four, Gave them a twisted form vermicular, And o'er the seat with plenteous wadding stuff'd Induced a splendid cover green and blue, Yellow and red, of tapestry richly wrought And woven close, or needle-work sublime. There might ye see the piony spread wide, The full-blown rose, the shepherd and his lass, Lap-dog and lambkin with black staring eyes, And parrots with twin cherries in their beak. Now came the cane from India, smooth and bright With Nature's varnish; sever'd into stripes That interlaced each other, these supplied Of texture firm a lattice-work, that braced The new machine, and it became a chair. But restless was the chair; the back erect Distress'd the weary loins that felt no ease; The slippery seat betray'd the sliding part That press'd it, and the feet hung dangling down, Anxious in vain to find the distant floor. These for the rich: the rest, whom fate had placed In modest mediocrity, content With base materials, sat on well-tann'd hides Obdurate and unyielding, glassy smooth, With here and there a tuft of crimson yarn, Or scarlet crewel in the cushion fixt: If cushion might be call'd, what harder seem'd Than the firm oak of which the frame was form'd. No want of timber then was felt or fear'd In Albion's happy isle. The lumber stood Ponderous, and fixt by its own massy weight. But elbows still were wanting; these, some say, An Alderman of Cripplegate contrived, And some ascribe the invention to a priest Burly and big and studious of his ease. But rude at first, and not with easy slope Receding wide, they press'd against the ribs, And bruised the side, and elevated high Taught the raised shoulders to invade the ears. Long time elapsed or ere our rugged sires Complain'd, though incommodiously pent in, And ill at ease behind. The ladies first 'Gan murmur, as became the softer sex. Ingenious fancy, never better pleased Than when employ'd to accommodate the fair, Heard the sweet moan with pity, and devised The soft settee; one elbow at each end, And in the midst an elbow, it received United yet divided, twain at once. So sit two Kings of Brentford on one throne; And so two citizens who take the air Close pack'd and smiling in a chaise and one. But relaxation of the languid frame By soft recumbency of outstretch'd limbs, Was bliss reserved for happier days;—so slow The growth of what is excellent, so hard To attain perfection in this nether world. Thus first necessity invented stools, Convenience next suggested elbow chairs, And luxury the accomplished Sofa last. The nurse sleeps sweetly, hired to watch the sick Whom snoring she disturbs. As sweetly he Who quits the coach-box at the midnight hour To sleep within the carriage more secure, His legs depending at the open door. Sweet sleep enjoys the Curate in his desk, The tedious Rector drawling o'er his head, And sweet the Clerk below: but neither sleep Of lazy nurse, who snores the sick man dead, Nor his who quits the box at midnight hour To slumber in the carriage more secure, Nor sleep enjoy'd by Curate in his desk, Nor yet the dozings of the Clerk are sweet, Compared with the repose the Sofa yields. Oh may I live exempted (while I live Guiltless of pamper'd appetite obscene,) From pangs arthritic that infest the toe Of libertine excess. The Sofa suits The gouty limb, 'tis true; but gouty limb, Though on a Sofa, may I never feel: For I have loved the rural walk through lanes Of grassy swarth close cropt by nibbling sheep, And skirted thick with intertexture firm Of thorny boughs; have loved the rural walk O'er hills, through valleys, and by river's brink, E'er since a truant boy I pass'd my bounds To enjoy a ramble on the banks of Thames. And still remember, nor without regret Of hours that sorrow since has much endear'd, How oft, my slice of pocket store consumed, Still hungering pennyless and far from home, I fed on scarlet hips and stony haws, Or blushing crabs, or berries that emboss The bramble, black as jet, or sloes austere. Hard fare! but such as boyish appetite Disdains not, nor the palate undepraved By culinary arts unsavoury deems. No Sofa then awaited my return, Nor Sofa then I needed. Youth repairs His wasted spirits quickly, by long toil Incurring short fatigue; and though our years As life declines, speed rapidly away, And not a year but pilfers as he goes Some youthful grace that age would gladly keep, A tooth or auburn lock, and by degrees Their length and colour from the locks they spare; The elastic spring of an unwearied foot That mounts the stile with ease, or leaps the fence, That play of lungs inhaling and again Respiring freely the fresh air, that makes Swift pace or steep ascent no toil to me, Mine have not pilfer'd yet; nor yet impair'd My relish of fair prospect; scenes that soothed Or charm'd me young, no longer young, I find Still soothing and of power to charm me still. And witness, dear companion of my walks, Whose arm this twentieth winter I perceive Fast lock'd in mine, with pleasure such as love Confirm'd by long experience of thy worth And well-tried virtues could alone inspire,— Witness a joy that thou hast doubled long. Thou knowest my praise of nature most sincere, And that my raptures are not conjured up To serve occasions of poetic pomp, But genuine, and art partner of them all. How oft upon yon eminence our pace Has slacken'd to a pause, and we have borne The ruffling wind scarce conscious that it blew, While admiration feeding at the eye, And still unsated, dwelt upon the scene. Thence with what pleasure have we just discern'd The distant plough slow-moving, and beside His labouring team, that swerved not from the track, The sturdy swain diminish'd to a boy! Here Ouse, slow winding through a level plain Of spacious meads with cattle sprinkled o'er, Conducts the eye along his sinuous course Delighted. There, fast rooted in his bank Stand, never overlook'd, our favourite elms That screen the herdsman's solitary hut; While far beyond and overthwart the stream That as with molten glass inlays the vale, The sloping land recedes into the clouds; Displaying on its varied side the grace Of hedge-row beauties numberless, square tower, Tall spire, from which the sound of cheerful bells Just undulates upon the listening ear; Groves, heaths, and smoking villages remote. Scenes must be beautiful which daily view'd Please daily, and whose novelty survives Long knowledge and the scrutiny of years. Praise justly due to those that I describe. Nor rural sights alone, but rural sounds Exhilarate the spirit, and restore The tone of languid Nature. Mighty winds That sweep the skirt of some far-spreading wood Of ancient growth, make music not unlike The dash of ocean on his winding shore, And lull the spirit while they fill the mind, Unnumber'd branches waving in the blast, And all their leaves fast fluttering, all at once. Nor less composure waits upon the roar Of distant floods, or on the softer voice Of neighbouring fountain, or of rills that slip Through the cleft rock, and chiming as they fall Upon loose pebbles, lose themselves at length In matted grass, that with a livelier green Betrays the secret of their silent course. Nature inanimate employs sweet sounds, But animated Nature sweeter still To soothe and satisfy the human ear. Ten thousand warblers cheer the day, and one The livelong night: nor these alone whose notes Nice-finger'd art must emulate in vain, But cawing rooks, and kites that swim sublime In still repeated circles, screaming loud, The jay, the pie, and even the boding owl That hails the rising moon, have charms for me. Sounds inharmonious in themselves and harsh, Yet heard in scenes where peace for ever reigns, And only there, please highly for their sake. Peace to the artist, whose ingenious thought Devised the weather-house, that useful toy! Fearless of humid air and gathering rains Forth steps the man, an emblem of myself; More delicate his timorous mate retires. When Winter soaks the fields, and female feet Too weak to struggle with tenacious clay, Or ford the rivulets, are best at home, The task of new discoveries falls on me. At such a season and with such a charge Once went I forth, and found, till then unknown, A cottage, whither oft we since repair: 'Tis perch'd upon the green-hill top, but close Environ'd with a ring of branching elms That overhang the thatch, itself unseen, Peeps at the vale below; so thick beset With foliage of such dark redundant growth, I call'd the low-roof'd lodge the peasant's nest. And hidden as it is, and far remote From such unpleasing sounds as haunt the ear In village or in town, the bay of curs Incessant, clinking hammers, grinding wheels, And infants clamorous whether pleased or pain'd, Oft have I wish'd the peaceful covert mine. Here, I have said, at least I should possess The poet's treasure, silence, and indulge The dreams of fancy, tranquil and secure. Vain thought! the dweller in that still retreat Dearly obtains the refuge it affords. Its elevated site forbids the wretch To drink sweet waters of the crystal well; He dips his bowl into the weedy ditch, And heavy-laden brings his beverage home, Far-fetch'd and little worth; nor seldom waits, Dependent on the baker's punctual call, To hear his creaking panniers at the door, Angry and sad, and his last crust consumed. So farewell envy of the peasant's nest. If solitude make scant the means of life, Society for me! Thou seeming sweet, Be still a pleasing object in my view, My visit still, but never mine abode. Not distant far, a length of colonnade Invites us: Monument of ancient taste, Now scorn'd, but worthy of a better fate. Our fathers knew the value of a screen From sultry suns, and in their shaded walks And long-protracted bowers, enjoy'd at noon The gloom and coolness of declining day. We bear our shades about us; self-deprived Of other screen, the thin umbrella spread, And range an Indian waste without a tree. Thanks to Benevolus; he spares me yet These chestnuts ranged in corresponding lines, And though himself so polish'd, still reprieves The obsolete prolixity of shade. Descending now (but cautious, lest too fast,) A sudden steep, upon a rustic bridge We pass a gulf in which the willows dip Their pendent boughs, stooping as if to drink. Hence ancle-deep in moss and flowery thyme We mount again, and feel at every step Our foot half sunk in hillocks green and soft, Raised by the mole, the miner of the soil. He not unlike the great ones of mankind, Disfigures earth, and plotting in the dark Toils much to earn a monumental pile, That may record the mischiefs he has done. The summit gain'd, behold the proud alcove That crowns it! yet not all its pride secures The grand retreat from injuries impress'd By rural carvers, who with knives deface The panels, leaving an obscure rude name In characters uncouth, and spelt amiss. So strong the zeal to immortalize himself Beats in the breast of man, that even a few Few transient years won from the abyss abhorr'd Of blank oblivion, seem a glorious prize, And even to a clown. Now roves the eye, And posted on this speculative height Exults in its command. The sheep-fold here Pours out its fleecy tenants o'er the glebe. At first, progressive as a stream, they seek The middle field; but scatter'd by degrees Each to his choice, soon whiten all the land. There, from the sun-burnt hay-field homeward creeps The loaded wain, while lighten'd of its charge The wain that meets it passes swiftly by, The boorish driver leaning o'er his team Vociferous, and impatient of delay. Nor less attractive is the woodland scene, Diversified with trees of every growth Alike yet various. Here the grey smooth trunks Of ash, or lime, or beech, distinctly shine, Within the twilight of their distant shades; There lost behind a rising ground, the wood Seems sunk, and shorten'd to its topmost boughs. No tree in all the grove but has its charms, Though each its hue peculiar; paler some, And of a wannish grey; the willow such And poplar, that with silver lines his leaf, And ash far-stretching his umbrageous arm; Of deeper green the elm; and deeper still, Lord of the woods, the long-surviving oak. Some glossy-leaved and shining in the sun, The maple, and the beech of oily nuts Prolific, and the lime at dewy eve Diffusing odours: nor unnoted pass The sycamore, capricious in attire, Now green, now tawny, and ere autumn yet Have changed the woods, in scarlet honours bright. O'er these, but far beyond, (a spacious map Of hill and valley interposed between,) The Ouse, dividing the well-water'd land, Now glitters in the sun, and now retires, As bashful, yet impatient to be seen. Hence the declivity is sharp and short, And such the re-ascent; between them weeps A little Naiad her impoverish'd urn All summer long, which winter fills again. The folded gates would bar my progress now, But that the Lord of this enclosed demesne, Communicative of the good he owns, Admits me to a share: the guiltless eye Commits no wrong, nor wastes what it enjoys. Refreshing change! where now the blazing sun? By short transition we have lost his glare, And stepp'd at once into a cooler clime. Ye fallen avenues! once more I mourn Your fate unmerited, once more rejoice That yet a remnant of your race survives. How airy and how light the graceful arch, Yet aweful as the consecrated roof Reechoing pious anthems! while beneath The chequer'd earth seems restless as a flood Brush'd by the wind. So sportive is the light Shot through the boughs, it dances as they dance, Shadow and sunshine intermingling quick, And darkening and enlightening, as the leaves Play wanton, every moment, every spot. And now with nerves new-braced and spirits cheer'd We tread the wilderness, whose well-roll'd walks With curvature of slow and easy sweep,— Deception innocent,—give ample space To narrow bounds. The grove receives us next; Between the upright shafts of whose tall elms We may discern the thresher at his task. Thump after thump, resounds the constant flail, That seems to swing uncertain, and yet falls Full on the destined ear. Wide flies the chaff, The rustling straw sends up a frequent mist Of atoms sparkling in the noon-day beam. Come hither, ye that press your beds of down And sleep not,—see him sweating o'er his bread Before he eats it.—'Tis the primal curse, But soften'd into mercy; made the pledge Of cheerful days, and nights without a groan. By ceaseless action, all that is subsists. Constant rotation of the unwearied wheel That nature rides upon, maintains her health, Her beauty, her fertility. She dreads An instant's pause, and lives but while she moves. Its own revolvency upholds the world. Winds from all quarters agitate the air, And fit the limpid element for use, Else noxious: oceans, rivers, lakes, and streams All feel the freshening impulse, and are cleansed By restless undulation. Even the oak Thrives by the rude concussion of the storm; He seems indeed indignant, and to feel The impression of the blast with proud disdain, Frowning as if in his unconscious arm He held the thunder. But the monarch owes His firm stability to what he scorns, More fixt below, the more disturb'd above. The law by which all creatures else are bound, Binds man the lord of all. Himself derives No mean advantage from a kindred cause, From strenuous toil his hours of sweetest ease. The sedentary stretch their lazy length When custom bids, but no refreshment find, For none they need: the languid eye, the cheek Deserted of its bloom, the flaccid, shrunk, And wither'd muscle, and the vapid soul, Reproach their owner with that love of rest To which he forfeits even the rest he loves. Not such the alert and active. Measure life By its true worth, the comforts it affords, And theirs alone seems worthy of the name. Good health, and its associate in the most, Good temper; spirits prompt to undertake, And not soon spent, though in an arduous task; The powers of fancy and strong thought are theirs; Even age itself seems privileged in them With clear exemption from its own defects. A sparkling eye beneath a wrinkled front The veteran shows, and gracing a grey beard With youthful smiles, descends towards the grave Sprightly, and old almost without decay. Like a coy maiden, ease, when courted most, Farthest retires,—an idol, at whose shrine Who oftenest sacrifice are favour'd least. The love of Nature, and the scenes she draws Is Nature's dictate. Strange! there should be found Who self-imprison'd in their proud saloons, Renounce the odours of the open field For the unscented fictions of the loom; Who satisfied with only pencil'd scenes, Prefer to the performance of a God The inferior wonders of an artist's hand. Lovely indeed the mimic works of art, But Nature's works far lovelier. I admire— None more admires the painter's magic skill, Who shows me that which I shall never see, Conveys a distant country into mine, And throws Italian light on English walls. But imitative strokes can do no more Than please the eye, sweet Nature every sense. The air salubrious of her lofty hills, The cheering fragrance of her dewy vales And music of her woods,—no works of man May rival these; these all bespeak a power Peculiar, and exclusively her own. Beneath the open sky she spreads the feast; 'Tis free to all,—'tis every day renew'd, Who scorns it, starves deservedly at home. He does not scorn it, who imprison'd long In some unwholesome dungeon, and a prey To sallow sickness, which the vapours dank And clammy of his dark abode have bred, Escapes at last to liberty and light. His cheek recovers soon its healthful hue, His eye relumines its extinguish'd fires, He walks, he leaps, he runs,—is wing'd with joy, And riots in the sweets of every breeze. He does not scorn it, who has long endured A fever's agonies, and fed on drugs. Nor yet the mariner, his blood inflamed With acrid salts; his very heart athirst To gaze at Nature in her green array. Upon the ship's tall side he stands, possess'd With visions prompted by intense desire; Fair fields appear below, such as he left Far distant, such as he would die to find,— He seeks them headlong, and is seen no more. The spleen is seldom felt where Flora reigns; The lowering eye, the petulance, the frown, And sullen sadness that o'ershade, distort, And mar the face of beauty, when no cause For such immeasurable woe appears, These Flora banishes, and gives the fair Sweet smiles and bloom less transient than her own. It is the constant revolution stale And tasteless, of the same repeated joys, That palls and satiates, and makes languid life A pedler's pack, that bows the bearer down. Health suffers, and the spirits ebb; the heart Recoils from its own choice,—at the full feast Is famish'd,—finds no music in the song, No smartness in the jest, and wonders why. Yet thousands still desire to journey on, Though halt and weary of the path they tread. The paralytic who can hold her cards But cannot play them, borrows a friend's hand To deal and shuffle, to divide and sort Her mingled suits and sequences, and sits Spectatress both and spectacle, a sad And silent cypher, while her proxy plays. Others are dragg'd into the crowded room Between supporters; and once seated, sit Through downright inability to rise, Till the stout bearers lift the corpse again. These speak a loud memento. Yet even these Themselves love life, and cling to it, as he That overhangs a torrent to a twig. They love it, and yet loathe it; fear to die, Yet scorn the purposes for which they live. Then wherefore not renounce them? No—the dread, The slavish dread of solitude that breeds Reflection and remorse, the fear of shame, And their inveterate habits, all forbid. Whom call we gay? That honour has been long The boast of mere pretenders to the name. The innocent are gay;—the lark is gay That dries his feathers saturate with dew Beneath the rosy cloud, while yet the beams Of day-spring overshoot his humble nest. The peasant too, a witness of his song, Himself a songster, is as gay as he. But save me from the gaiety of those Whose head-aches nail them to a noonday bed; And save me too from theirs whose haggard eyes Flash desperation, and betray their pangs For property stripp'd off by cruel chance; From gaiety that fills the bones with pain, The mouth with blasphemy, the heart with woe. The earth was made so various, that the mind Of desultory man, studious of change, And pleased with novelty, might be indulged. Prospects however lovely may be seen Till half their beauties fade; the weary sight, Too well acquainted with their smiles, slides off Fastidious, seeking less familiar scenes. Then snug inclosures in the shelter'd vale, Where frequent hedges intercept the eye, Delight us, happy to renounce a while, Not senseless of its charms, what still we love, That such short absence may endear it more. Then forests, or the savage rock may please, That hides the sea-mew in his hollow clefts Above the reach of man: his hoary head Conspicuous many a league, the mariner Bound homeward, and in hope already there, Greets with three cheers exulting. At his waist A girdle of half-wither'd shrubs he shows, And at his feet the baffled billows die. The common overgrown with fern, and rough With prickly goss, that shapeless and deform And dangerous to the touch, has yet its bloom And decks itself with ornaments of gold, Yields no unpleasing ramble; there the turf Smells fresh, and rich in odoriferous herbs And fungous fruits of earth, regales the sense With luxury of unexpected sweets. There often wanders one, whom better days Saw better clad, in cloak of sattin trimm'd With lace, and hat with splendid ribband bound. A serving-maid was she, and fell in love With one who left her, went to sea and died. Her fancy follow'd him through foaming waves To distant shores, and she would sit and weep At what a sailor suffers; fancy too, Delusive most where warmest wishes are, Would oft anticipate his glad return, And dream of transports she was not to know. She heard the doleful tidings of his death, And never smiled again. And now she roams The dreary waste; there spends the livelong day, And there, unless when charity forbids, The livelong night. A tatter'd apron hides, Worn as a cloak, and hardly hides a gown More tatter'd still; and both but ill conceal A bosom heaved with never-ceasing sighs. She begs an idle pin of all she meets, And hoards them in her sleeve; but needful food, Though press'd with hunger oft, or comelier clothes, Though pinch'd with cold, asks never.—Kate is crazed. I see a column of slow-rising smoke O'ertop the lofty wood that skirts the wild. A vagabond and useless tribe there eat Their miserable meal. A kettle slung Between two poles upon a stick transverse, Receives the morsel; flesh obscene of dog, Or vermin, or at best, of cock purloin'd From his accustom'd perch. Hard-faring race! They pick their fuel out of every hedge, Which kindled with dry leaves, just saves unquench'd The spark of life. The sportive wind blows wide Their fluttering rags, and shows a tawny skin, The vellum of the pedigree they claim. Great skill have they in palmistry, and more To conjure clean away the gold they touch, Conveying worthless dross into its place. Loud when they beg, dumb only when they steal. Strange! that a creature rational, and cast In human mould, should brutalize by choice His nature, and though capable of arts By which the world might profit and himself, Self-banish'd from society, prefer Such squalid sloth to honourable toil. Yet even these, though feigning sickness oft They swathe the forehead, drag the limping limb And vex their flesh with artificial sores, Can change their whine into a mirthful note When safe occasion offers, and with dance And music of the bladder and the bag Beguile their woes and make the woods resound. Such health and gaiety of heart enjoy The houseless rovers of the sylvan world; And breathing wholesome air, and wandering much, Need other physic none to heal the effects Of loathsome diet, penury, and cold. Blest he, though undistinguish'd from the crowd By wealth or dignity, who dwells secure Where man, by nature fierce, has laid aside His fierceness, having learnt, though slow to learn, The manners and the arts of civil life. His wants, indeed, are many; but supply Is obvious; placed within the easy reach Of temperate wishes and industrious hands. Here virtue thrives as in her proper soil; Not rude and surly, and beset with thorns, And terrible to sight, as when she springs, (If e'er she spring spontaneous,) in remote And barbarous climes, where violence prevails, And strength is lord of all; but gentle, kind, By culture tamed, by liberty refresh'd, And all her fruits by radiant truth matured. War and the chase engross the savage whole: War follow'd for revenge, or to supplant The envied tenants of some happier spot, The chase for sustenance, precarious trust! His hard condition with severe constraint Binds all his faculties, forbids all growth Of wisdom, proves a school in which he learns Sly circumvention, unrelenting hate, Mean self-attachment, and scarce aught beside. Thus fare the shivering natives of the north, And thus the rangers of the western world Where it advances far into the deep, Towards the Antarctic. Even the favour'd isles So lately found, although the constant sun Cheer all their seasons with a grateful smile, Can boast but little virtue; and inert Through plenty, lose in morals what they gain In manners, victims of luxurious ease. These therefore I can pity, placed remote From all that science traces, art invents, Or inspiration teaches; and inclosed In boundless oceans never to be pass'd By navigators uninform'd as they, Or plough'd perhaps by British bark again. But far beyond the rest, and with most cause, Thee, gentle savage! whom no love of thee Or thine, but curiosity perhaps, Or else vain-glory, prompted us to draw Forth from thy native bowers, to show thee here With what superior skill we can abuse The gifts of Providence, and squander life. The dream is past. And thou hast found again Thy cocoas and bananas, palms and yams, And homestall thatch'd with leaves. But hast thou found Their former charms? And having seen our state, Our palaces, our ladies, and our pomp Of equipage, our gardens, and our sports, And heard our music; are thy simple friends, Thy simple fare, and all thy plain delights As dear to thee as once? And have thy joys Lost nothing by comparison with ours? Rude as thou art (for we return'd thee rude And ignorant, except of outward show,) I cannot think thee yet so dull of heart And spiritless, as never to regret Sweets tasted here, and left as soon as known. Methinks I see thee straying on the beach, And asking of the surge that bathes thy foot If ever it has wash'd our distant shore. I see thee weep, and thine are honest tears, A patriot's for his country. Thou art sad At thought of her forlorn and abject state, From which no power of thine can raise her up. Thus fancy paints thee, and though apt to err, Perhaps errs little, when she paints thee thus. She tells me too, that duly every morn Thou climb'st the mountain top, with eager eye Exploring far and wide the watery waste For sight of ship from England. Every speck Seen in the dim horizon, turns thee pale With conflict of contending hopes and fears. But comes at last the dull and dusky eve, And sends thee to thy cabin, well-prepared To dream all night of what the day denied. Alas! expect it not. We found no bait To tempt us in thy country. Doing good, Disinterested good, is not our trade. We travel far 'tis true, but not for nought; And must be bribed to compass earth again By other hopes and richer fruits than yours. But though true worth and virtue, in the mild And genial soil of cultivated life Thrive most, and may perhaps thrive only there, Yet not in cities oft,—in proud and gay And gain-devoted cities; thither flow, As to a common and most noisome sewer, The dregs and fæculence of every land. In cities foul example on most minds Begets its likeness. Rank abundance breeds In gross and pamper'd cities sloth and lust, And wantonness and gluttonous excess. In cities, vice is hidden with most ease, Or seen with least reproach; and virtue taught By frequent lapse, can hope no triumph there Beyond the achievement of successful flight. I do confess them nurseries of the arts, In which they flourish most; where in the beams Of warm encouragement, and in the eye Of public note they reach their perfect size. Such London is, by taste and wealth proclaim'd The fairest capital of all the world, By riot and incontinence the worst. There touch'd by Reynolds, a dull blank becomes A lucid mirror, in which nature sees All her reflected features. Bacon there Gives more than female beauty to a stone, And Chatham's eloquence to marble lips. Nor does the chisel occupy alone The powers of sculpture, but the style as much; Each province of her art her equal care. With nice incision of her guided steel She ploughs a brazen field, and clothes a soil So sterile with what charms soe'er she will, The richest scenery and the loveliest forms. Where finds philosophy her eagle eye With which she gazes at yon burning disk Undazzled, and detects and counts his spots? In London. Where her implements exact With which she calculates, computes and scans All distance, motion, magnitude, and now Measures an atom, and now girds a world? In London. Where has commerce such a mart, So rich, so throng'd, so drain'd, and so supplied As London, opulent, enlarged, and still Increasing London? Babylon of old Not more the glory of the earth, than she A more accomplish'd world's chief glory now. She has her praise. Now mark a spot or two That so much beauty would do well to purge; And show this Queen of Cities, that so fair May yet be foul, so witty, yet not wise. It is not seemly, nor of good report That she is slack in discipline,—more prompt To avenge than to prevent the breach of law. That she is rigid in denouncing death On petty robbers, and indulges life And liberty, and oft-times honour too To peculators of the public gold. That thieves at home must hang; but he that puts Into his overgorged and bloated purse The wealth of Indian provinces, escapes. Nor is it well, nor can it come to good, That through profane and infidel contempt Of holy writ, she has presumed to annul And abrogate, as roundly as she may, The total ordonance and will of God; Advancing fashion to the post of truth, And centering all authority in modes And customs of her own, till sabbath rites Have dwindled into unrespected forms, And knees and hassocks are well-nigh divorced. God made the country, and man made the town. What wonder then, that health and virtue, gifts That can alone make sweet the bitter draught That life holds out to all, should most abound And least be threatened in the fields and groves? Possess ye therefore, ye who borne about In chariots and sedans, know no fatigue But that of idleness, and taste no scenes But such as art contrives,—possess ye still Your element; there only ye can shine, There only minds like yours can do no harm. Our groves were planted to console at noon The pensive wanderer in their shades. At eve The moon-beam sliding softly in between The sleeping leaves, is all the light they wish, Birds warbling all the music. We can spare The splendour of your lamps, they but eclipse Our softer satellite. Your songs confound Our more harmonious notes. The thrush departs Scared, and the offended nightingale is mute. There is a public mischief in your mirth, It plagues your country. Folly such as yours Graced with a sword, and worthier of a fan, Has made, which enemies could ne'er have done, Our arch of empire, steadfast but for you, A mutilated structure, soon to fall. BOOK II. THE TIME-PIECE. ARGUMENT OF THE SECOND BOOK. Which opens with reflections suggested by the conclusion of the former. Peace among the nations recommended on the ground of their common fellowship in sorrow. Prodigies enumerated. Sicilian earthquakes. Man rendered obnoxious to these calamities by sin. God the agent in them. The philosophy that stops at secondary causes, reproved. Our own late miscarriages accounted for. Satirical notice taken of our trips to Fontainbleau. But the pulpit, not satire, the proper engine of reformation. The Reverend Advertiser of engraved sermons. Petit maitre parson. The good preacher. Picture of a theatrical clerical coxcomb. Story-tellers and jesters in the pulpit reproved. Apostrophe to popular applause. Retailers of ancient philosophy expostulated with. Sum of the whole matter. Effects of sacerdotal mismanagement on the laity. Their folly and extravagance. The mischiefs of profusion. Profusion itself, with all its consequent evils, ascribed, as to its principal cause, to the want of discipline in the Universities. Oh for a lodge in some vast wilderness, Some boundless contiguity of shade, Where rumour of oppression and deceit, Of unsuccessful or successful war Might never reach me more! My ear is pain'd, My soul is sick with every day's report Of wrong and outrage with which earth is fill'd. There is no flesh in man's obdurate heart, It does not feel for man. The natural bond Of brotherhood is sever'd as the flax That falls asunder at the touch of fire. He finds his fellow guilty of a skin Not colour'd like his own, and having power To inforce the wrong, for such a worthy cause Dooms and devotes him as his lawful prey. Lands intersected by a narrow frith Abhor each other. Mountains interposed, Make enemies of nations who had else Like kindred drops been mingled into one. Thus man devotes his brother, and destroys; And worse than all, and most to be deplored As human nature's broadest, foulest blot, Chains him, and tasks him, and exacts his sweat With stripes, that mercy with a bleeding heart Weeps when she sees inflicted on a beast. Then what is man? And what man seeing this, And having human feelings, does not blush And hang his head, to think himself a man? I would not have a slave to till my ground, To carry me, to fan me while I sleep, And tremble when I wake, for all the wealth That sinews bought and sold have ever earn'd. No: dear as freedom is, and in my heart's Just estimation prized above all price, I had much rather be myself the slave And wear the bonds, than fasten them on him. We have no slaves at home.—Then why abroad? And they themselves once ferried o'er the wave That parts us, are emancipate and loosed. Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs Receive our air, that moment they are free, They touch our country and their shackles fall. That's noble, and bespeaks a nation proud And jealous of the blessing. Spread it then, And let it circulate through every vein Of all your empire! that where Britain's power Is felt, mankind may feel her mercy too. Sure there is need of social intercourse, Benevolence and peace and mutual aid Between the nations, in a world that seems To toll the death-bell of its own decease, And by the voice of all its elements To preach the general doom Alluding to the late calamities at Jamaica. C.. When were the winds Let slip with such a warrant to destroy? When did the waves so haughtily o'erleap Their ancient barriers, deluging the dry? Fire from beneath, and meteors August 18, 1783. C. from above Portentous, unexampled, unexplained, Have kindled beacons in the skies; and the old And crazy earth has had her shaking fits More frequent, and foregone her usual rest. Is it a time to wrangle, when the props And pillars of our planet seem to fail, And Nature Alluding to the fog that covered both Europe and Asia during the whole summer of 1783. C. with a dim and sickly eye To wait the close of all? But grant her end More distant, and that prophecy demands A longer respite, unaccomplished yet; Still they are frowning signals, and bespeak Displeasure in his breast who smites the earth Or heals it, makes it languish or rejoice. And 'tis but seemly, that where all deserve And stand exposed by common peccancy To what no few have felt, there should be peace, And brethren in calamity should love. Alas for Sicily! rude fragments now Lie scatter'd where the shapely column stood. Her palaces are dust. In all her streets The voice of singing and the sprightly chord Are silent. Revelry and dance and show Suffer a syncope and solemn pause, While God performs upon the trembling stage Of his own works, his dreadful part alone. How does the earth receive him?—with what signs Of gratulation and delight, her king? Pours she not all her choicest fruits abroad, Her sweetest flowers, her aromatic gums, Disclosing paradise where'er he treads? She quakes at his approach. Her hollow womb Conceiving thunders, through a thousand deeps And fiery caverns roars beneath his foot. The hills move lightly and the mountains smoke, For He has touch'd them. From the extremest point Of elevation down into the abyss, His wrath is busy and his frown is felt. The rocks fall headlong and the valleys rise; The rivers die into offensive pools, And charged with putrid verdure, breathe a gross And mortal nuisance into all the air. What solid was, by transformation strange Grows fluid; and the fixt and rooted earth Tormented into billows heaves and swells, Or with vortiginous and hideous whirl Sucks down its prey insatiable. Immense The tumult and the overthrow, the pangs And agonies of human and of brute Multitudes, fugitive on every side, And fugitive in vain. The sylvan scene Migrates uplifted, and with all its soil Alighting in far distant fields, finds out A new possessor, and survives the change. Ocean has caught the frenzy, and upwrought To an enormous and o'erbearing height, Not by a mighty wind, but by that voice Which winds and waves obey, invades the shore Resistless. Never such a sudden flood, Upridged so high, and sent on such a charge, Possess'd an inland scene. Where now the throng That press'd the beach, and hasty to depart Look'd to the sea for safety? They are gone, Gone with the refluent wave into the deep, A prince with half his people. Ancient towers, And roofs embattled high, the gloomy scenes Where beauty oft and letter'd worth consume Life in the unproductive shades of death, Fall prone; the pale inhabitants come forth, And happy in their unforeseen release From all the rigours of restraint, enjoy The terrors of the day that sets them free. Who then that has thee, would not hold thee fast, Freedom! whom they that lose thee, so regret, That even a judgement making way for thee, Seems in their eyes, a mercy, for thy sake. Such evil sin hath wrought; and such a flame Kindled in heaven, that it burns down to earth, And in the furious inquest that it makes On God's behalf, lays waste his fairest works. The very elements, though each be meant The minister of man, to serve his wants, Conspire against him. With his breath, he draws A plague into his blood, and cannot use Life's necessary means, but he must die. Storms rise to o'erwhelm him: or if stormy winds Rise not, the waters of the deep shall rise, And needing none assistance of the storm, Shall roll themselves ashore, and reach him there. The earth shall shake him out of all his holds, Or make his house his grave: nor so content, Shall counterfeit the motions of the flood, And drown him in her dry and dusty gulfs. What then,—were they the wicked above all, And we the righteous, whose fast anchor'd isle Moved not, while theirs was rock'd like a light skiff, The sport of every wave? No: none are clear, And none than we more guilty. But where all Stand chargeable with guilt, and to the shafts Of wrath obnoxious, God may chuse his mark, May punish, if he please, the less, to warn The more malignant. If he spared not them, Tremble and be amazed at thine escape, Far guiltier England! lest he spare not thee. Happy the man who sees a God employed In all the good and ill that checquer life! Resolving all events with their effects And manifold results, into the will And arbitration wise of the Supreme. Did not his eye rule all things, and intend The least of our concerns, (since from the least The greatest oft originate,)—could chance Find place in his dominion, or dispose One lawless particle to thwart his plan, Then God might be surprised, and unforeseen Contingence might alarm him, and disturb The smooth and equal course of his affairs. This truth, philosophy, though eagle-eyed In Nature's tendencies, oft overlooks, And having found his instrument, forgets Or disregards, or more presumptuous still, Denies the power that wields it. God proclaims His hot displeasure against foolish men That live an atheist life; involves the heaven In tempests, quits his grasp upon the winds And gives them all their fury; bids a plague Kindle a fiery boil upon the skin, And putrify the breath of blooming health. He calls for famine, and the meagre fiend Blows mildew from between his shrivel'd lips, And taints the golden ear. He springs his mines, And desolates a nation at a blast. Forth steps the spruce philosopher, and tells Of homogeneal and discordant springs And principles; of causes, how they work By necessary laws their sure effects; Of action and re-action. He has found The source of the disease that nature feels, And bids the world take heart and banish fear. Thou fool! will thy discovery of the cause Suspend the effect or heal it? Has not God Still wrought by means since first he made the world, And did he not of old employ his means To drown it? What is his creation less Than a capacious reservoir of means Form'd for his use, and ready at his will? Go, dress thine eyes with eye-salve, ask of him Or ask of whomsoever he has taught, And learn, though late, the genuine cause of all. England, with all thy faults, I love thee still, My country! and while yet a nook is left Where English minds and manners may be found, Shall be constrain'd to love thee. Though thy clime Be fickle, and thy year, most part, deformed With dripping rains, or wither'd by a frost, I would not yet exchange thy sullen skies And fields without a flower, for warmer France With all her vines; nor for Ausonia's groves Of golden fruitage and her myrtle bowers. To shake thy senate, and from heights sublime Of patriot eloquence to flash down fire Upon thy foes, was never meant my task; But I can feel thy fortunes, and partake Thy joys and sorrows with as true a heart As any thunderer there. And I can feel Thy follies too, and with a just disdain Frown at effeminates, whose very looks Reflect dishonour on the land I love. How, in the name of soldiership and sense, Should England prosper, when such things, as smooth And tender as a girl, all essenced o'er With odours, and as profligate as sweet, Who sell their laurel for a myrtle wreath, And love when they should fight; when such as these Presume to lay their hand upon the ark Of her magnificent and aweful cause? Time was when it was praise and boast enough In every clime, and travel where we might, That we were born her children; praise enough To fill the ambition of a private man, That Chatham's language was his mother tongue, And Wolfe's great name compatriot with his own. Farewell those honours, and farewell with them The hope of such hereafter. They have fallen Each in his field of glory: one in arms, And one in council. Wolfe upon the lap Of smiling victory that moment won, And Chatham, heart-sick of his country's shame. They made us many soldiers. Chatham still Consulting England's happiness at home, Secured it by an unforgiving frown If any wrong'd her. Wolfe, where'er he fought, Put so much of his heart into his act, That his example had a magnet's force, And all were swift to follow whom all loved. Those suns are set. Oh rise some other such! Or all that we have left is empty talk Of old achievements, and despair of new. Now hoist the sail, and let the streamers float Upon the wanton breezes. Strew the deck With lavender, and sprinkle liquid sweets, That no rude savour maritime invade The nose of nice nobility. Breathe soft Ye clarionets, and softer still ye flutes, That winds and waters lull'd by magic sounds May bear us smoothly to the Gallic shore. True, we have lost an empire,—let it pass. True, we may thank the perfidy of France That pick'd the jewel out of England's crown With all the cunning of an envious shrew. And let that pass,—'twas but a trick of state. A brave man knows no malice, but at once Forgets in peace the injuries of war, And gives his direst foe a friend's embrace. And shamed as we have been, to the very beard Braved and defied, and in our own sea proved Too weak for those decisive blows, that once Insured us mastery there, we yet retain Some small pre-eminence; we justly boast At least superior jockeyship, and claim The honours of the turf as all our own. Go then, well worthy of the praise ye seek, And show the shame ye might conceal at home, In foreign eyes!—be grooms, and win the plate, Where once your nobler fathers won a crown!— 'Tis generous to communicate your skill To those that need it. Folly is soon learn'd; And under such preceptors, who can fail? There is a pleasure in poetic pains Which only poets know. The shifts and turns, The expedients and inventions multiform To which the mind resorts, in chase of terms Though apt, yet coy, and difficult to win,— To arrest the fleeting images that fill The mirror of the mind, and hold them fast, And force them sit, till he has pencil'd off A faithful likeness of the forms he views; Then to dispose his copies with such art That each may find its most propitious light, And shine by situation, hardly less Than by the labour and the skill it cost, Are occupations of the poet's mind So pleasing, and that steal away the thought With such address, from themes of sad import, That lost in his own musings, happy man! He feels the anxieties of life, denied Their wonted entertainment, all retire. Such joys has he that sings. But ah! not such, Or seldom such, the hearers of his song. Fastidious, or else listless, or perhaps Aware of nothing arduous in a task They never undertook, they little note His dangers or escapes, and haply find There least amusement where he found the most. But is amusement all? studious of song, And yet ambitious not to sing in vain, I would not trifle merely, though the world Be loudest in their praise who do no more. Yet what can satire, whether grave or gay? It may correct a foible, may chastise The freaks of fashion, regulate the dress, Retrench a sword-blade, or displace a patch; But where are its sublimer trophies found? What vice has it subdued? whose heart reclaim'd By rigour, or whom laugh'd into reform? Alas! Leviathan is not so tamed. Laugh'd at, he laughs again; and stricken hard, Turns to the stroke his adamantine scales, That fear no discipline of human hands. The pulpit therefore, (and I name it, fill'd With solemn awe, that bids me well beware With what intent I touch that holy thing;) The pulpit, (when the satirist has at last, Strutting and vapouring in an empty school, Spent all his force, and made no proselyte;) I say the pulpit (in the sober use Of its legitimate peculiar powers,) Must stand acknowledged, while the world shall stand, The most important and effectual guard, Support, and ornament of virtue's cause. There stands the messenger of truth. There stands The legate of the skies; his theme divine, His office sacred, his credentials clear. By him, the violated law speaks out Its thunders, and by him, in strains as sweet As angels use, the gospel whispers peace. He stablishes the strong, restores the weak, Reclaims the wanderer, binds the broken heart, And arm'd himself in panoply complete Of heavenly temper, furnishes with arms Bright as his own, and trains by every rule Of holy discipline, to glorious war, The sacramental host of God's elect. Are all such teachers? would to heaven all were! But hark,—the Doctor's voice!—fast wedged between Two empirics he stands, and with swoln cheeks Inspires the news, his trumpet. Keener far Than all invective is his bold harangue, While through that public organ of report He hails the clergy; and defying shame, Announces to the world his own and theirs. He teaches those to read, whom schools dismiss'd, And colleges, untaught; sells accent, tone, And emphasis in score, and gives to prayer The adagio and andante it demands. He grinds divinity of other days Down into modern use; transforms old print To zigzag manuscript, and cheats the eyes Of gallery critics by a thousand arts.— Are there who purchase of the Doctor's ware? Oh name it not in Gath!—it cannot be, That grave and learned Clerks should need such aid. He doubtless is in sport, and does but droll, Assuming thus a rank unknown before, Grand caterer and dry nurse of the church. I venerate the man, whose heart is warm, Whose hands are pure, whose doctrine and whose life Coincident, exhibit lucid proof That he is honest in the sacred cause. To such I render more than mere respect, Whose actions say that they respect themselves. But loose in morals, and in manners vain, In conversation frivolous, in dress Extreme, at once rapacious and profuse, Frequent in park, with lady at his side, Ambling and prattling scandal as he goes, But rare at home, and never at his books, Or with his pen, save when he scrawls a card; Constant at routes, familiar with a round Of ladyships, a stranger to the poor; Ambitious of preferment for its gold, And well prepared by ignorance and sloth, By infidelity and love of the world To make God's work a sinecure; a slave To his own pleasures and his patron's pride;— From such apostles, O ye mitred heads, Preserve the church! and lay not careless hands On sculls that cannot teach, and will not learn. Would I describe a preacher, such as Paul, Were he on earth, would hear, approve, and own, Paul should himself direct me. I would trace His master-strokes, and draw from his design. I would express him simple, grave, sincere; In doctrine uncorrupt; in language plain; And plain in manner. Decent, solemn, chaste, And natural in gesture. Much impress'd Himself, as conscious of his aweful charge, And anxious mainly that the flock he feeds May feel it too. Affectionate in look, And tender in address, as well becomes A messenger of grace to guilty men. Behold the picture!—Is it like?—Like whom? The things that mount the rostrum with a skip, And then skip down again; pronounce a text, Cry, hem; and reading what they never wrote,— Just fifteen minutes, huddle up their work, And with a well-bred whisper close the scene. In man or woman, but far most in man, And most of all in man that ministers And serves the altar, in my soul I loath All affectation. 'Tis my perfect scorn; Object of my implacable disgust. What!—will a man play tricks, will he indulge A silly fond conceit of his fair form And just proportion, fashionable mien And pretty face, in presence of his God? Or will he seek to dazzle me with tropes, As with the diamond on his lily hand, And play his brilliant parts before my eyes When I am hungry for the bread of life? He mocks his Maker, prostitutes and shames His noble office, and instead of truth Displaying his own beauty, starves his flock. Therefore avaunt! all attitude and stare And start theatric, practised at the glass. I seek divine simplicity in him Who handles things divine; and all beside, Though learn'd with labour, and though much admired By curious eyes and judgements ill-inform'd, To me is odious as the nasal twang Heard at conventicle, where worthy men Misled by custom, strain celestial themes Through the prest nostril, spectacle-bestrid. Some, decent in demeanour while they preach, That task perform'd, relapse into themselves, And having spoken wisely, at the close Grow wanton, and give proof to every eye, Whoe'er was edified, themselves were not. Forth comes the pocket mirror. First we stroke An eyebrow; next, compose a straggling lock; Then with an air, most gracefully perform'd, Fall back into our seat; extend an arm And lay it at its ease with gentle care, With handkerchief in hand, depending low. The better hand more busy, gives the nose Its bergamot, or aids the indebted eye With opera glass to watch the moving scene, And recognize the slow-retiring fair. Now this is fulsome, and offends me more Than in a churchman slovenly neglect And rustic coarseness would. An heavenly mind May be indifferent to her house of clay, And slight the hovel as beneath her care; But how a body so fantastic, trim, And quaint in its deportment and attire, Can lodge an heavenly mind,—demands a doubt. He that negotiates between God and man, As God's ambassador, the grand concerns Of judgement and of mercy, should beware Of lightness in his speech. 'Tis pitiful To court a grin, when you should woo a soul; To break a jest, when pity would inspire Pathetic exhortation; and to address The skittish fancy with facetious tales, When sent with God's commission to the heart. So did not Paul. Direct me to a quip Or merry turn in all he ever wrote, And I consent you take it for your text, Your only one, till sides and benches fail. No: he was serious in a serious cause, And understood too well the weighty terms That he had ta'en in charge. He would not stoop To conquer those by jocular exploits, Whom truth and soberness assail'd in vain. Oh, popular applause! what heart of man Is proof against thy sweet seducing charms? The wisest and the best feel urgent need Of all their caution in thy gentlest gales; But swell'd into a gust,—who then, alas! With all his canvass set, and inexpert And therefore heedless, can withstand thy power? Praise from the rivel'd lips of toothless, bald Decrepitude; and in the looks of lean And craving poverty; and in the bow Respectful of the smutch'd artificer Is oft too welcome, and may much disturb The bias of the purpose. How much more Pour'd forth by beauty splendid and polite, In language soft as adoration breathes? Ah spare your idol! think him human still; Charms he may have, but he has frailties too; Dote not too much, nor spoil what ye admire. All truth is from the sempiternal source Of light divine. But Egypt, Greece, and Rome Drew from the stream below. More favour'd we Drink, when we chuse it, at the fountain head. To them it flow'd much mingled and defiled With hurtful error, prejudice, and dreams Illusive of philosophy, so call'd, But falsely. Sages after sages strove In vain, to filter off a chrystal draught Pure from the lees, which often more enhanced The thirst than slaked it, and not seldom bred Intoxication and delirium wild. In vain they push'd enquiry to the birth And spring-time of the world, asked, whence is man? Why form'd at all? And wherefore as he is? Where must he find his Maker? With what rites Adore him? Will He hear, accept, and bless? Or does he sit regardless of his works? Has man within him an immortal seed? Or does the tomb take all? If he survive His ashes, where? and in what weal or woe? Knots worthy of solution, which alone A Deity could solve. Their answers vague And all at random, fabulous and dark, Left them as dark themselves. Their rules of life Defective and unsanction'd, proved too weak To bind the roving appetite, and lead Blind Nature to a God not yet reveal'd. 'Tis Revelation satisfies all doubts, Explains all mysteries except her own, And so illuminates the path of life That fools discover it, and stray no more. Now tell me, dignified and sapient sir, My man of morals, nurtured in the shades Of Academus, is this false or true? Is Christ the abler teacher, or the schools? If Christ, then why resort at every turn To Athens or to Rome for wisdom short Of man's occasions, when in Him reside Grace, knowledge, comfort, an unfathom'd store? How oft when Paul has served us with a text, Has Epictetus, Plato, Tully preach'd! Men that, if now alive, would sit content And humble learners of a Saviour's worth, Preach it who might. Such was their love of truth, Their thirst of knowledge, and their candour too. And thus it is. The pastor, either vain By nature, or by flattery made so, taught To gaze at his own splendour, and to exalt Absurdly, not his office, but himself; Or unenlighten'd, and too proud to learn, Or vicious, and not therefore apt to teach, Perverting often by the stress of lewd And loose example, whom he should instruct, Exposes and holds up to broad disgrace The noblest function, and discredits much The brightest truths that man has ever seen. For ghostly counsel, if it either fall Below the exigence, or be not back'd With show of love, at least with hopeful proof Of some sincerity on the giver's part; Or be dishonour'd in the exterior form And mode of its conveyance, by such tricks As move derision, or by foppish airs And histrionic mummery, that let down The pulpit to the level of the stage, Drops from the lips a disregarded thing. The weak perhaps are moved, but are not taught, While prejudice in men of stronger minds Takes deeper root, confirm'd by what they see. A relaxation of religion's hold Upon the roving and untutor'd heart Soon follows, and the curb of conscience snapt, The laity run wild.—But do they now? Note their extravagance, and be convinced. As nations ignorant of God, contrive A wooden one, so we, no longer taught By monitors that mother church supplies, Now make our own. Posterity will ask (If e'er posterity see verse of mine,) Some fifty or an hundred lustrums hence, What was a monitor in George's days? My very gentle reader, yet unborn, Of whom I needs must augur better things, Since Heaven would sure grow weary of a world Productive only of a race like us, A monitor is wood. Plank shaven thin. We wear it at our backs. There closely braced And neatly fitted, it compresses hard The prominent and most unsightly bones, And binds the shoulders flat. We prove its use Sovereign and most effectual to secure A form not now gymnastic as of yore, From rickets and distortion, else, our lot. But thus admonish'd we can walk erect, One proof at least of manhood; while the friend Sticks close, a Mentor worthy of his charge. Our habits costlier than Lucullus wore, And by caprice as multiplied as his, Just please us while the fashion is at full, But change with every moon. The sycophant That waits to dress us, arbitrates their date, Surveys his fair reversion with keen eye; Finds one ill made, another obsolete, This fits not nicely, that is ill conceived, And making prize of all that he condemns, With our expenditure defrays his own. Variety's the very spice of life That gives it all its flavour. We have run Through every change that fancy at the loom Exhausted, has had genius to supply, And studious of mutation still, discard A real elegance a little used For monstrous novelty and strange disguise. We sacrifice to dress, till household joys And comforts cease. Dress drains our cellar dry, And keeps our larder lean. Puts out our fires, And introduces hunger, frost, and woe, Where peace and hospitality might reign. What man that lives and that knows how to live, Would fail to exhibit at the public shows A form as splendid as the proudest there, Though appetite raise outcries at the cost? A man of the town dines late, but soon enough With reasonable forecast and dispatch, To insure a side-box station at half price. You think perhaps, so delicate his dress, His daily fare as delicate. Alas! He picks clean teeth, and busy as he seems With an old tavern quill, is hungry yet. The rout is folly's circle which she draws With magic wand. So potent is the spell, That none decoy'd into that fatal ring, Unless by Heaven's peculiar grace, escape. There we grow early grey, but never wise; There form connexions, and acquire no friend; Solicit pleasure hopeless of success; Waste youth in occupations only fit For second childhood, and devote old age To sports which only childhood could excuse. There they are happiest who dissemble best Their weariness; and they the most polite Who squander time and treasure with a smile, Though at their own destruction. She that asks Her dear five hundred friends, contemns them all, And hates their coming. They, what can they less? Make just reprisals, and with cringe and shrug And bow obsequious, hide their hate of her. All catch the frenzy, downward from her Grace, Whose flambeaux flash against the morning skies And gild our chamber ceilings as they pass, To her who, frugal only that her thrift May feed excesses she can ill afford, Is hackney'd home unlackey'd,—who in haste Alighting, turns the key in her own door, And at the watchman's lantern borrowing light, Finds a cold bed her only comfort left. Wives beggar husbands, husbands starve their wives, On Fortune's velvet altar offering up Their last poor pittance;—Fortune most severe Of goddesses yet known, and costlier far Than all that held their routs in heathen heaven.— So fare we in this prison-house the world: And 'tis a fearful spectacle to see So many maniacs dancing in their chains. They gaze upon the links that hold them fast With eyes of anguish, execrate their lot, Then shake them in despair, and dance again. Now basket up the family of plagues That waste our vitals. Peculation, sale Of honour, perjury, corruption, frauds By forgery, by subterfuge of law, By tricks and lies as numerous and as keen As the necessities their authors feel; Then cast them closely bundled, every brat At the right door. Profusion is its sire. Profusion unrestrain'd, with all that's base In character, has litter'd all the land, And bred within the memory of no few, A priesthood such as Baal's was of old, A people such as never was till now. It is a hungry vice:—it eats up all That gives society its beauty, strength, Convenience, and security, and use; Makes men mere vermin, worthy to be trapp'd And gibbeted as fast as catchpole claws Can seize the slippery prey: unties the knot Of union, and converts the sacred band That holds mankind together, to a scourge. Profusion deluging a state with lusts Of grossest nature and of worst effects, Prepares it for its ruin; hardens, blinds, And warps the consciences of public men Till they can laugh at virtue, mock the fools That trust them, and in the end disclose a face That would have shock'd credulity herself Unmask'd, vouchsafing this their sole excuse, Since all alike are selfish—why not they? This does Profusion, and the accursed cause Of such deep mischief, has itself a cause. In colleges and halls, in ancient days, When learning, virtue, piety and truth Were precious, and inculcated with care, There dwelt a sage call'd Discipline. His head Not yet by time completely silver'd o'er, Bespoke him past the bounds of freakish youth, But strong for service still, and unimpair'd. His eye was meek and gentle, and a smile Play'd on his lips, and in his speech was heard Paternal sweetness, dignity, and love. The occupation dearest to his heart Was to encourage goodness. He would stroke The head of modest and ingenuous worth That blush'd at its own praise, and press the youth Close to his side that pleased him. Learning grew Beneath his care, a thriving vigorous plant; The mind was well inform'd, the passions held Subordinate, and diligence was choice. If e'er it chanced, as sometimes chance it must, That one among so many overleap'd The limits of control, his gentle eye Grew stern, and darted a severe rebuke; His frown was full of terror, and his voice Shook the delinquent with such fits of awe As left him not, till penitence had won Lost favour back again, and closed the breach. But Discipline, a faithful servant long, Declined at length into the vale of years; A palsy struck his arm, his sparkling eye Was quench'd in rheums of age, his voice unstrung Grew tremulous, and moved derision more Than reverence, in perverse rebellious youth. So colleges and halls neglected much Their good old friend, and Discipline at length O'erlook'd and unemploy'd, fell sick and died. Then study languish'd, emulation slept, And virtue fled. The schools became a scene Of solemn farce, where ignorance in stilts, His cap well lined with logic not his own, With parrot tongue perform'd the scholar's part, Proceeding soon a graduated dunce. Then compromise had place, and scrutiny Became stone-blind, precedence went in truck, And he was competent whose purse was so. A dissolution of all bonds ensued, The curbs invented for the muleish mouth Of headstrong youth were broken; bars and bolts Grew rusty by disuse, and massy gates Forgot their office, opening with a touch; Till gowns at length are found mere masquerade; The tassell'd cap and the spruce band a jest, A mockery of the world. What need of these For gamesters, jockies, brothellers impure, Spendthrifts and booted sportsmen, oftener seen With belted waist and pointers at their heels, Than in the bounds of duty? What was learn'd, If aught was learn'd in childhood, is forgot, And such expense as pinches parents blue, And mortifies the liberal hand of love, Is squander'd in pursuit of idle sports And vicious pleasures; buys the boy a name, That sits a stigma on his father's house, And cleaves through life inseparably close To him that wears it. What can after-games Of riper joys, and commerce with the world, The lewd vain world that must receive him soon, Add to such erudition thus acquired Where science and where virtue are profess'd? They may confirm his habits, rivet fast His folly, but to spoil him is a task That bids defiance to the united powers Of fashion, dissipation, taverns, stews. Now blame we most the nurselings or the nurse? The children crook'd and twisted and deform'd Through want of care, or her whose winking eye And slumbering oscitancy mars the brood? The nurse no doubt. Regardless of her charge She needs herself correction; needs to learn That it is dangerous sporting with the world, With things so sacred as a nation's trust, The nurture of her youth, her dearest pledge. All are not such. I had a brother once,— Peace to the memory of a man of worth, A man of letters, and of manners too; Of manners sweet as virtue always wears, When gay good-nature dresses her in smiles. He graced a college in which order yet Was sacred, and was honour'd loved and wept By more than one, themselves conspicuous there. Some minds are temper'd happily, and mixt With such ingredients of good sense and taste Of what is excellent in man, they thirst With such a zeal to be what they approve, That no restraints can circumscribe them more, Than they themselves by choice, for wisdom's sake. Nor can example hurt them, what they see Of vice in others but enhancing more The charms of virtue in their just esteem. If such escape contagion, and emerge Pure from so foul a pool, to shine abroad, And give the world their talents and themselves, Small thanks to those whose negligence or sloth Exposed their inexperience to the snare, And left them to an undirected choice. See then! the quiver broken and decay'd In which are kept our arrows. Rusting there In wild disorder and unfit for use, What wonder if discharged into the world They shame their shooters with a random flight, Their points obtuse, and feathers drunk with wine. Well may the church wage unsuccessful war With such artillery arm'd. Vice parries wide The undreaded volley with a sword of straw, And stands an impudent and fearless mark. Have we not track'd the felon home, and found His birthplace and his dam? the country mourns, Mourns, because every plague that can infest Society, and that saps and worms the base Of the edifice that policy has raised, Swarms in all quarters; meets the eye, the ear, And suffocates the breath at every turn. Profusion breeds them. And the cause itself Of that calamitous mischief has been found: Found too where most offensive, in the skirts Of the robed pedagogue. Else, let the arraign'd Stand up unconscious and refute the charge. So when the Jewish Leader stretch'd his arm And waved his rod divine, a race obscene Spawn'd in the muddy beds of Nile, came forth Polluting Egypt. Gardens, fields, and plains Were cover'd with the pest. The streets were fill'd; The croaking nuisance lurk'd in every nook, Nor palaces nor even chambers 'scaped, And the land stank, so numerous was the fry. BOOK III. THE GARDEN.

As one who long in thickets and in brakes Entangled, winds now this way and now that His devious course uncertain, seeking home; Or having long in miry ways been foiled And sore discomfited, from slough to slough Plunging, and half despairing of escape, If chance at length he find a green-sward smooth And faithful to the foot, his spirits rise, He chirrups brisk his ear-erecting steed, And winds his way with pleasure and with ease; So I, designing other themes, and call'd To adorn the Sofa with eulogium due, To tell its slumbers and to paint its dreams, Have rambled wide. In country, city, seat Of academic fame, (howe'er deserved,) Long held, and scarcely disengaged at last. But now with pleasant pace, a cleanlier road I mean to tread. I feel myself at large, Courageous, and refresh'd for future toil, If toil await me, or if dangers new. Since pulpits fail, and sounding-boards reflect Most part an empty ineffectual sound, What chance that I, to fame so little known, Nor conversant with men or manners much, Should speak to purpose, or with better hope Crack the satiric thong? 'Twere wiser far For me enamour'd of sequester'd scenes, And charm'd with rural beauty, to repose Where chance may throw me, beneath elm or vine, My languid limbs when summer sears the plains, Or when rough winter rages, on the soft And shelter'd Sofa, while the nitrous air Feeds a blue flame and makes a cheerful hearth; There undisturb'd by Folly, and apprized How great the danger of disturbing her, To muse in silence, or at least confine Remarks that gall so many, to the few My partners in retreat. Disgust conceal'd Is oft-times proof of wisdom, when the fault Is obstinate, and cure beyond our reach. Domestic happiness, thou only bliss Of Paradise that has survived the fall! Though few now taste thee unimpair'd and pure, Or tasting, long enjoy thee, too infirm Or too incautious to preserve thy sweets Unmixt with drops of bitter, which neglect Or temper sheds into thy crystal cup; Thou art the nurse of virtue. In thine arms She smiles, appearing, as in truth she is, Heaven-born and destined to the skies again. Thou art not known where Pleasure is adored, That reeling goddess with the zoneless waist And wandering eyes, still leaning on the arm Of Novelty, her fickle frail support; For thou art meek and constant, hating change, And finding in the calm of truth-tied love Joys that her stormy raptures never yield. Forsaking thee, what shipwreck have we made Of honour, dignity, and fair renown, Till prostitution elbows us aside In all our crowded streets, and senates seem Convened for purposes of empire less, Than to release the adulteress from her bond. The adulteress! what a theme for angry verse, What provocation to the indignant heart That feels for injured love! but I disdain The nauseous task to paint her as she is, Cruel, abandon'd, glorying in her shame. No. Let her pass, and charioted along In guilty splendour, shake the public ways! The frequency of crimes has wash'd them white; And verse of mine shall never brand the wretch, Whom matrons now of character unsmirched And chaste themselves, are not ashamed to own. Virtue and vice had boundaries in old time Not to be pass'd; and she that had renounced Her sex's honour, was renounced herself By all that prized it; not for prudery's sake, But dignity's, resentful of the wrong. 'Twas hard perhaps on here and there a waif Desirous to return and not received; But was an wholesome rigour in the main, And taught the unblemish'd to preserve with care That purity, whose loss was loss of all. Men too were nice in honour in those days, And judged offenders well. And he that sharp'd, And pocketed a prize by fraud obtain'd, Was mark'd and shunn'd as odious. He that sold His country, or was slack when she required His every nerve in action and at stretch, Paid with the blood that he had basely spared The price of his default. But now, yes, now, We are become so candid and so fair, So liberal in construction, and so rich In christian charity, a good-natured age! That they are safe, sinners of either sex, Transgress what laws they may. Well dress'd, well bred, Well equipaged, is ticket good enough To pass us readily through every door. Hypocrisy, detest her as we may, (And no man's hatred ever wrong'd her yet,) May claim this merit still, that she admits The worth of what she mimics with such care, And thus gives virtue indirect applause; But she has burnt her mask not needed here, Where vice has such allowance, that her shifts And specious semblances have lost their use. I was a stricken deer that left the herd Long since; with many an arrow deep infixt My panting side was charged when I withdrew To seek a tranquil death in distant shades. There was I found by one who had himself Been hurt by the archers. In his side he bore And in his hands and feet the cruel scars. With gentle force soliciting the darts He drew them forth, and heal'd and bade me live. Since then, with few associates, in remote And silent woods I wander, far from those My former partners of the peopled scene, With few associates, and not wishing more. Here much I ruminate, as much I may, With other views of men and manners now Than once, and others of a life to come. I see that all are wanderers, gone astray, Each in his own delusions; they are lost In chase of fancied happiness, still wooed And never won. Dream after dream ensues, And still they dream that they shall still succeed, And still are disappointed; rings the world With the vain stir. I sum up half mankind, And add two-thirds of the remainder half, And find the total of their hopes and fears Dreams, empty dreams. The million flit as gay As if created only, like the fly That spreads his motley wings in the eye of noon, To sport their season and be seen no more. The rest are sober dreamers, grave and wise, And pregnant with discoveries new and rare. Some write a narrative of wars and feats Of heroes little known, and call the rant An history; describe the man, of whom His own coevals took but little note, And paint his person, character and views, As they had known him from his mother's womb. They disentangle from the puzzled skein In which obscurity has wrapp'd them up, The threads of politic and shrewd design That ran through all his purposes, and charge His mind with meanings that he never had, Or having, kept conceal'd. Some drill and bore The solid earth, and from the strata there Extract a register, by which we learn That He who made it and reveal'd its date To Moses, was mistaken in its age. Some more acute and more industrious still Contrive creation; travel nature up To the sharp peak of her sublimest height, And tell us whence the stars; why some are fixt, And planetary some; what gave them first Rotation, from what fountain flow'd their light. Great contest follows, and much learned dust Involves the combatants, each claiming truth, And truth disclaiming both. And thus they spend The little wick of life's poor shallow lamp, In playing tricks with nature, giving laws To distant worlds and trifling in their own. Is 't not a pity now that tickling rheums Should ever tease the lungs and blear the sight Of oracles like these? Great pity too, That having wielded the elements, and built A thousand systems, each in his own way, They should go out in fume and be forgot? Ah! what is life thus spent? and what are they But frantic who thus spend it? all for smoke,— Eternity for bubbles, proves at last A senseless bargain. When I see such games Play'd by the creatures of a Power who swears That he will judge the earth, and call the fool To a sharp reckoning that has lived in vain; And when I weigh this seeming wisdom well And prove it in the infallible result So hollow and so false,—I feel my heart Dissolve in pity, and account the learn'd, If this be learning, most of all deceived. Great crimes alarm the conscience, but she sleeps While thoughtful man is plausibly amused. Defend me therefore common sense, say I, From reveries so airy, from the toil Of dropping buckets into empty wells, And growing old in drawing nothing up! 'Twere well, says one sage erudite, profound, Terribly arch'd and aquiline his nose, And overbuilt with most impending brows, 'Twere well could you permit the world to live As the world pleases. What's the world to you?— Much. I was born of woman, and drew milk As sweet as charity from human breasts. I think, articulate, I laugh and weep And exercise all functions of a man. How then should I and any man that lives Be strangers to each other? Pierce my vein, Take of the crimson stream meandering there And catechise it well. Apply your glass, Search it, and prove now if it be not blood Congenial with thine own. And if it be, What edge of subtlety canst thou suppose Keen enough, wise and skilful as thou art, To cut the link of brotherhood, by which One common Maker bound me to the kind? True; I am no proficient, I confess, In arts like yours. I cannot call the swift And perilous lightnings from the angry clouds, And bid them hide themselves in the earth beneath; I cannot analyse the air, nor catch The parallax of yonder luminous point That seems half quench'd in the immense abyss: Such powers I boast not;—neither can I rest A silent witness of the headlong rage Or heedless folly by which thousands die, Bone of my bone, and kindred souls to mine. God never meant that man should scale the heavens By strides of human wisdom. In his works Though wonderous, He commands us in his word To seek him rather, where his mercy shines. The mind indeed enlighten'd from above Views him in all; ascribes to the grand cause The grand effect; acknowledges with joy His manner, and with rapture tastes his style. But never yet did philosophic tube That brings the planets home into the eye Of observation, and discovers, else Not visible, his family of worlds, Discover Him that rules them; such a veil Hangs over mortal eyes, blind from the birth And dark in things divine. Full often too Our wayward intellect, the more we learn Of nature, overlooks her Author more, From instrumental causes proud to draw Conclusions retrograde and mad mistake. But if his word once teach us, shoot a ray Through all the heart's dark chambers, and reveal Truths undiscern'd but by that holy light, Then all is plain. Philosophy baptized In the pure fountain of eternal love Has eyes indeed; and viewing all she sees As meant to indicate a God to man, Gives Him his praise, and forfeits not her own. Learning has borne such fruit in other days On all her branches. Piety has found Friends in the friends of science, and true prayer Has flow'd from lips wet with Castalian dews. Such was thy wisdom, Newton, child-like sage! Sagacious reader of the works of God, And in his word sagacious. Such too thine, Milton, whose genius had angelic wings, And fed on manna. And such thine in whom Our British Themis gloried with just cause, Immortal Hale! for deep discernment praised And sound integrity not more, than famed For sanctity of manners undefiled. All flesh is grass Isaiah, xl. 6., and all its glory fades Like the fair flower dishevel'd in the wind; Riches have wings Prov. xxiii. 5., and grandeur is a dream; The man we celebrate must find a tomb, And we that worship him, ignoble graves. Nothing is proof against the general curse Of vanity, that seizes all below. The only amaranthine flower on earth Is virtue, the only lasting treasure, truth. But what is truth? 'twas Pilate's question put To Truth itself, that deign'd him no reply. And wherefore? will not God impart his light To them that ask it?—Freely;—'tis his joy, His glory, and his nature to impart: But to the proud, uncandid, insincere Or negligent enquirer, not a spark. What's that which brings contempt upon a book And him that writes it, though the style be neat, The method clear, and argument exact? That makes a minister in holy things The joy of many and the dread of more, His name a theme for praise and for reproach? That while it gives us worth in God's account, Depreciates and undoes us in our own? What pearl is it that rich men cannot buy, That learning is too proud to gather up, But which the poor and the despised of all Seek and obtain, and often find unsought? Tell me, and I will tell thee, what is truth. Oh friendly to the best pursuits of man, Friendly to thought, to virtue, and to peace, Domestic life in rural leisure pass'd! Few know thy value, and few taste thy sweets, Though many boast thy favours, and affect To understand and chuse thee for their own. But foolish man foregoes his proper bliss Even as his first progenitor, and quits, Though placed in paradise, (for earth has still Some traces of her youthful beauty left,) Substantial happiness for transient joy. Scenes form'd for contemplation, and to nurse The growing seeds of wisdom; that suggest By every pleasing image they present Reflections such as meliorate the heart, Compose the passions and exalt the mind, Scenes such as these, 'tis his supreme delight To fill with riot and defile with blood. Should some contagion kind to the poor brutes We persecute, annihilate the tribes That draw the sportsman over hill and dale Fearless, and rapt away from all his cares; Should never game-fowl hatch her eggs again, Nor baited hook deceive the fish's eye; Could pageantry and dance and feast and song Be quell'd in all our summer-month retreats; How many self-deluded nymphs and swains Who dream they have a taste for fields and groves, Would find them hideous nurseries of the spleen, And crowd the roads, impatient for the town! They love the country, and none else, who seek For their own sake its silence and its shade; Delights which who would leave, that has a heart Susceptible of pity, or a mind Cultured and capable of sober thought, For all the savage din of the swift pack And clamours of the field? detested sport, That owes its pleasures to another's pain, That feeds upon the sobs and dying shrieks Of harmless nature, dumb, but yet endued With eloquence that agonies inspire Of silent tears and heart-distending sighs! Vain tears alas! and sighs that never find A corresponding tone in jovial souls. Well,—one at least is safe. One shelter'd hare Has never heard the sanguinary yell Of cruel man, exulting in her woes. Innocent partner of my peaceful home, Whom ten long years experience of my care Has made at last familiar, she has lost Much of her vigilant instinctive dread, Not needful here, beneath a roof like mine. Yes,—thou may'st eat thy bread, and lick the hand That feeds thee; thou may'st frolic on the floor At evening, and at night retire secure To thy straw-couch, and slumber unalarm'd. For I have gain'd thy confidence, have pledged All that is human in me, to protect Thine unsuspecting gratitude and love. If I survive thee I will dig thy grave, And when I place thee in it, sighing say, I knew at least one hare that had a friend. How various his employments, whom the world Calls idle, and who justly in return Esteems that busy world an idler too! Friends, books, a garden, and perhaps his pen, Delightful industry enjoyed at home, And nature in her cultivated trim Dressed to his taste, inviting him abroad:— Can he want occupation who has these? Will he be idle who has much to enjoy? Me therefore, studious of laborious ease, Not slothful; happy to deceive the time Not waste it; and aware that human life Is but a loan to be repaid with use, When He shall call his debtors to account, From whom are all our blessings, business finds Even here. While sedulous I seek to improve, At least neglect not, or leave unemploy'd The mind he gave me; driving it, though slack Too oft, and much impeded in its work By causes not to be divulged in vain, To its just point the service of mankind. He that attends to his interior self, That has a heart and keeps it, has a mind That hungers and supplies it, and who seeks A social, not a dissipated life, Has business; feels himself engaged to achieve No unimportant, though a silent task. A life all turbulence and noise may seem To him that leads it, wise and to be praised; But wisdom is a pearl with most success Sought in still water, and beneath clear skies. He that is ever occupied in storms, Or dives not for it, or brings up instead, Vainly industrious, a disgraceful prize. The morning finds the self-sequester'd man Fresh for his task, intend what task he may. Whether inclement seasons recommend His warm but simple home, where he enjoys With her who shares his pleasures and his heart, Sweet converse, sipping calm the fragrant lymph Which neatly she prepares; then to his book Well chosen, and not sullenly perused In selfish silence, but imparted oft As aught occurs that she may smile to hear, Or turn to nourishment digested well. Or if the garden with its many cares, All well repay'd, demand him, he attends The welcome call, conscious how much the hand Of lubbard labour needs his watchful eye, Oft loitering lazily if not o'erseen, Or misapplying his unskilful strength. Nor does he govern only or direct, But much performs himself; no works indeed That ask robust tough sinews bred to toil, Servile employ,—but such as may amuse, Not tire, demanding rather skill than force. Proud of his well-spread walls, he views his trees That meet, (no barren interval between,) With pleasure more than even their fruits afford, Which, save himself who trains them, none can feel. These therefore are his own peculiar charge; No meaner hand may discipline the shoots, None but his steel approach them. What is weak, Distemper'd, or has lost prolific powers Impair'd by age, his unrelenting hand Dooms to the knife. Nor does he spare the soft And succulent that feeds its giant growth But barren, at the expense of neighbouring twigs Less ostentatious, and yet studded thick With hopeful gems. The rest, no portion left That may disgrace his art, or disappoint Large expectation, he disposes neat At measured distances, that air and sun Admitted freely may afford their aid, And ventilate and warm the swelling buds. Hence summer has her riches, autumn hence, And hence even winter fills his wither'd hand With blushing fruits, and plenty not his own. Miraturque novos fructus et non sua poma. Virg. C. Fair recompense of labour well bestow'd And wise precaution, which a clime so rude Makes needful still, whose Spring is but the child Of churlish Winter, in her froward moods Discovering much the temper of her sire. For oft, as if in her the stream of mild Maternal nature had reversed its course, She brings her infants forth with many smiles, But once deliver'd, kills them with a frown. He therefore, timely warn'd, himself supplies Her want of care, screening and keeping warm The plenteous bloom, that no rough blast may sweep His garlands from the boughs. Again, as oft As the sun peeps and vernal airs breathe mild, The fence withdrawn, he gives them every beam, And spreads his hopes before the blaze of day. To raise the prickly and green-coated gourd So grateful to the palate, and when rare So coveted, else base and disesteem'd,— Food for the vulgar merely,—is an art That toiling ages have but just matured, And at this moment unessay'd in song. Yet gnats have had, and frogs and mice long since Their eulogy; those sang the Mantuan bard, And these the Grecian in ennobling strains; And in thy numbers, Phillips, shines for aye The solitary Shilling. Pardon then, Ye sage dispensers of poetic fame! The ambition of one meaner far, whose powers Presuming an attempt not less sublime, Pant for the praise of dressing to the taste Of critic appetite, no sordid fare, A cucumber, while costly yet and scarce. The stable yields a stercorarious heap Impregnated with quick fermenting salts, And potent to resist the freezing blast. For ere the beech and elm have cast their leaf Deciduous, and when now November dark Checks vegetation in the torpid plant Exposed to his cold breath, the task begins. Warily therefore, and with prudent heed He seeks a favour'd spot, that where he builds The agglomerated pile, his frame may front The sun's meridian disk, and at the back Enjoy close shelter, wall, or reeds, or hedge Impervious to the wind. First he bids spread Dry fern or litter'd hay, that may imbibe The ascending damps; then leisurely impose And lightly, shaking it with agile hand From the full fork, the saturated straw. What longest binds the closest, forms secure The shapely side, that as it rises takes By just degrees an overhanging breadth, Sheltering the base with its projected eaves. The uplifted frame compact at every joint, And overlaid with clear translucent glass, He settles next upon the sloping mount, Whose sharp declivity shoots off secure From the dash'd pane the deluge as it falls: He shuts it close, and the first labour ends. Thrice must the voluble and restless earth Spin round upon her axle, ere the warmth Slow gathering in the midst, through the square mass Diffused, attain the surface. When behold! A pestilent and most corrosive steam, Like a gross fog Bœtian, rising fast, And fast condensed upon the dewy sash, Asks egress; which obtained, the overcharged And drench'd conservatory breathes abroad In volumes wheeling slow, the vapour dank, And purified, rejoices to have lost Its foul inhabitant. But to assuage The impatient fervour which it first conceives Within its reeking bosom, threatening death To his young hopes, requires discreet delay. Experience, slow preceptress, teaching oft The way to glory by miscarriage foul, Must prompt him, and admonish how to catch The auspicious moment, when the temper'd heat Friendly to vital motion, may afford Soft fermentation, and invite the seed. The seed selected wisely, plump and smooth And glossy, he commits to pots of size Diminutive, well fill'd with well-prepared And fruitful soil, that has been treasured long, And drunk no moisture from the dripping clouds. These on the warm and genial earth that hides The smoking manure and o'erspreads it all, He places lightly, and as time subdues The rage of fermentation, plunges deep In the soft medium, till they stand immersed. Then rise the tender germs upstarting quick And spreading wide their spongey lobes, at first Pale, wan, and livid, but assuming soon, If fann'd by balmy and nutritious air Strain'd through the friendly mats, a vivid green. Two leaves produced, two rough indented leaves, Cautious he pinches from the second stalk A pimple, that portends a future sprout, And interdicts its growth. Thence straight succeed The branches, sturdy to his utmost wish, Prolific all, and harbingers of more. The crowded roots demand enlargement now And transplantation in an ampler space. Indulged in what they wish, they soon supply Large foliage, overshadowing golden flowers, Blown on the summit of the apparent fruit. These have their sexes; and when summer shines The bee transports the fertilizing meal From flower to flower, and even the breathing air Wafts the rich prize to its appointed use. Not so when winter scowls: assistant art Then acts in nature's office, brings to pass The glad espousals and insures the crop. Grudge not, ye rich, (since luxury must have His dainties, and the world's more numerous half Lives by contriving delicates for you,) Grudge not the cost. Ye little know the cares, The vigilance, the labour, and the skill That day and night are exercised, and hang Upon the ticklish balance of suspense, That ye may garnish your profuse regales With summer fruits brought forth by wintry suns. Ten thousand dangers lie in wait to thwart The process. Heat and cold, and wind and steam, Moisture and drought, mice, worms, and swarming flies Minute as dust and numberless, oft work Dire disappointment that admits no cure, And which no care can obviate. It were long, Too long to tell the expedients and the shifts Which he that fights a season so severe Devises, while he guards his tender trust, And oft, at last, in vain. The learn'd and wise Sarcastic would exclaim, and judge the song Cold as its theme, and like its theme, the fruit Of too much labour, worthless when produced. Who loves a garden, loves a green-house too. Unconscious of a less propitious clime There blooms exotic beauty, warm and snug, While the winds whistle and the snows descend. The spiry myrtle with unwithering leaf Shines there and flourishes. The golden boast Of Portugal and western India there, The ruddier orange and the paler lime, Peep through their polish'd foliage at the storm, And seem to smile at what they need not fear. The amomum there with intermingling flowers And cherries hangs her twigs. Geranium boasts Her crimson honours, and the spangled beau Ficoides, glitters bright the winter long. All plants of every leaf that can endure The winter's frown, if screen'd from his shrewd bite, Live there and prosper. Those Ausonia claims, Levantine regions these; the Azores send Their jessamine, her jessamine remote Caffraria; foreigners from many lands They form one social shade, as if convened By magic summons of the Orphean lyre. Yet just arrangement, rarely brought to pass But by a master's hand, disposing well The gay diversities of leaf and flower, Must lend its aid to illustrate all their charms, And dress the regular yet various scene. Plant behind plant aspiring, in the van The dwarfish, in the rear retired, but still Sublime above the rest, the statelier stand. So once were ranged the sons of ancient Rome, A noble show! while Roscius trod the stage; And so, while Garrick as renown'd as he, The sons of Albion,—fearing each to lose Some note of Nature's music from his lips, And covetous of Shakespeare's beauty seen In every flash of his far-beaming eye. Nor taste alone and well-contrived display Suffice to give the marshal'd ranks the grace Of their complete effect. Much yet remains Unsung, and many cares are yet behind And more laborious; cares on which depends Their vigour, injured soon, not soon restored. The soil must be renew'd, which often wash'd Loses its treasure of salubrious salts, And disappoints the roots; the slender roots Close interwoven where they meet the vase Must smooth be shorn away; the sapless branch Must fly before the knife; the wither'd leaf Must be detach'd, and where it strews the floor Swept with a woman's neatness, breeding else Contagion, and disseminating death. Discharge but these kind offices, (and who Would spare, that loves them, offices like these?) Well they reward the toil. The sight is pleased, The scent regaled; each odoriferous leaf, Each opening blossom freely breathes abroad Its gratitude, and thanks him with its sweets. So manifold, all pleasing in their kind, All healthful, are the employs of rural life, Reiterated as the wheel of time Runs round, still ending, and beginning still. Nor are these all. To deck the shapely knoll That softly swell'd and gaily dress'd, appears A flowery island from the dark green lawn Emerging, must be deemed a labour due To no mean hand, and asks the touch of taste. Here also grateful mixture of well match'd And sorted hues, (each giving each relief, And by contrasted beauty shining more,) Is needful. Strength may wield the ponderous spade, May turn the clod, and wheel the compost home, But elegance, chief grace the garden shows And most attractive, is the fair result Of thought, the creature of a polish'd mind. Without it, all is Gothic as the scene To which the insipid citizen resorts Near yonder heath; where industry mispent, But proud of his uncouth ill-chosen task, Has made a heaven on earth; with suns and moons Of close-ramm'd stones has charged the incumber'd soil, And fairly laid the zodiac in the dust. He therefore who would see his flowers disposed Sightly and in just order, ere he gives The beds the trusted treasure of their seeds Forecasts the future whole; that when the scene Shall break into its preconceived display, Each for itself, and all as with one voice Conspiring, may attest his bright design. Nor even then, dismissing as perform'd His pleasant work, may he suppose it done. Few self-supported flowers endure the wind Uninjured, but expect the upholding aid Of the smooth-shaven prop, and neatly tied Are wedded thus like beauty to old age, For interest sake, the living to the dead. Some clothe the soil that feeds them, far diffused And lowly creeping, modest and yet fair, Like virtue, thriving most where little seen. Some more aspiring catch the neighbour shrub With clasping tendrils, and invest his branch Else unadorn'd, with many a gay festoon And fragrant chaplet, recompensing well The strength they borrow with the grace they lend. All hate the rank society of weeds Noisome, and ever greedy to exhaust The impoverish'd earth; an overbearing race, That like the multitude made faction-mad Disturb good order, and degrade true worth. Oh blest seclusion from a jarring world Which he thus occupied, enjoys! Retreat Cannot indeed to guilty man restore Lost innocence, or cancel follies past; But it has peace, and much secures the mind From all assaults of evil, proving still A faithful barrier, not o'erleap'd with ease By vicious custom, raging uncontrol'd Abroad, and desolating public life. When fierce temptation seconded within By traitor appetite, and arm'd with darts Temper'd in hell, invades the throbbing breast, To combat may be glorious, and success Perhaps may crown us; but to fly is safe. Had I the choice of sublunary good, What could I wish, that I possess not here? Health, leisure, means to improve it, friendship, peace; No loose or wanton, though a wandering muse, And constant occupation without care. Thus blest, I draw a picture of that bliss; Hopeless indeed that dissipated minds, And profligate abusers of a world Created fair so much in vain for them, Should seek the guiltless joys that I describe Allured by my report: but sure no less That self-condemn'd they must neglect the prize, And what they will not taste, must yet approve. What we admire we praise; and when we praise Advance it into notice, that its worth Acknowledged, others may admire it too. I therefore recommend, though at the risk Of popular disgust, yet boldly still, The cause of piety and sacred truth And virtue, and those scenes which God ordain'd Should best secure them and promote them most; Scenes that I love, and with regret perceive Forsaken, or through folly not enjoy'd. Pure is the nymph, though liberal of her smiles, And chaste, though unconfined, whom I extol; Not as the prince in Sushan, when he call'd Vain-glorious of her charms his Vashti forth To grace the full pavilion. His design Was but to boast his own peculiar good, Which all might view with envy, none partake. My charmer is not mine alone; my sweets And she that sweetens all my bitters too, Nature, enchanting Nature, in whose form And lineaments divine I trace a hand That errs not, and find raptures still renew'd, Is free to all men, universal prize. Strange that so fair a creature should yet want Admirers, and be destined to divide With meaner objects, even the few she finds. Stript of her ornaments, her leaves and flowers, She loses all her influence. Cities then Attract us, and neglected Nature pines Abandon'd, as unworthy of our love. But are not wholesome airs, though unperfumed By roses, and clear suns though scarcely felt, And groves if unharmonious, yet secure From clamour, and whose very silence charms, To be preferr'd to smoke, to the eclipse That metropolitan volcanoes make, Whose Stygian throats breathe darkness all day long, And to the stir of commerce, driving slow, And thundering loud, with his ten thousand wheels? They would be, were not madness in the head And folly in the heart; were England now What England was, plain, hospitable, kind, And undebauch'd. But we have bid farewell To all the virtues of those better days, And all their honest pleasures. Mansions once Knew their own masters, and laborious hinds That had survived the father, served the son. Now the legitimate and rightful Lord Is but a transient guest, newly arrived And soon to be supplanted. He that saw His patrimonial timber cast its leaf, Sells the last scantling, and transfers the price To some shrewd sharper, ere it buds again. Estates are landscapes, gazed upon awhile, Then advertised, and auctioneer'd away. The country starves, and they that feed the o'ercharged And surfeited lewd town with her fair dues, By a just judgement strip and starve themselves. The wings that waft our riches out of sight Grow on the gamester's elbows, and the alert And nimble motion of those restless joints That never tire, soon fans them all away. Improvement too, the idol of the age, Is fed with many a victim. Lo! he comes,— The omnipotent magician, Brown appears. Down falls the venerable pile, the abode Of our forefathers, a grave whisker'd race, But tasteless. Springs a palace in its stead, But in a distant spot; where more exposed It may enjoy the advantage of the North And agueish East, till time shall have transformed Those naked acres to a sheltering grove. He speaks. The lake in front becomes a lawn, Woods vanish, hills subside, and valleys rise, And streams, as if created for his use, Pursue the track of his directing wand, Sinuous or straight, now rapid and now slow, Now murmuring soft, now roaring in cascades, Even as he bids. The enraptured owner smiles. 'Tis finish'd! And yet finish'd as it seems, Still wants a grace, the loveliest it could show, A mine to satisfy the enormous cost. Drain'd to the last poor item of his wealth, He sighs, departs, and leaves the accomplish'd plan That he has touch'd, retouch'd, many a long day Labour'd, and many a night pursued in dreams, Just when it meets his hopes, and proves the heaven He wanted, for a wealthier to enjoy. And now perhaps the glorious hour is come, When having no stake left, no pledge to endear Her interests, or that gives her sacred cause A moment's operation on his love, He burns with most intense and flagrant zeal To serve his country. Ministerial grace Deals him out money from the public chest; Or if that mine be shut, some private purse Supplies his need with an usurious loan, To be refunded duly, when his vote, Well-managed, shall have earn'd its worthy price. Oh innocent compared with arts like these, Crape and cock'd pistol and the whistling ball Sent through the traveller's temples! He that finds One drop of heaven's sweet mercy in his cup, Can dig, beg, rot, and perish well-content, So he may wrap himself in honest rags At his last gasp; but could not for a world Fish up his dirty and dependent bread From pools and ditches of the commonwealth, Sordid and sickening at his own success. Ambition, avarice, penury incurr'd By endless riot, vanity, the lust Of pleasure and variety, dispatch, As duly as the swallows disappear, The world of wandering knights and 'squires to town. London ingulfs them all. The shark is there And the shark's prey; the spendthrift and the leech That sucks him: there the sycophant and he That with bare-headed and obsequious bows Begs a warm office, doom'd to a cold jail And groat per diem if his patron frown. The levee swarms, as if in golden pomp Were character'd on every statesman's door, “Batter'd and bankrupt fortunes mended here.” These are the charms that sully and eclipse The charms of nature. 'Tis the cruel gripe That lean hard-handed poverty inflicts, The hope of better things, the chance to win, The wish to shine, the thirst to be amused, That at the sound of Winter's hoary wing, Unpeople all our counties, of such herds Of fluttering, loitering, cringing, begging, loose And wanton vagrants, as make London, vast And boundless as it is, a crowded coop. Oh thou resort and mart of all the earth, Checquer'd with all complexions of mankind, And spotted with all crimes; in whom I see Much that I love, and more that I admire, And all that I abhor; thou freckled fair That pleases and yet shocks me, I can laugh And I can weep, can hope, and can despond, Feel wrath and pity, when I think on thee! Ten righteous would have saved a city once, And thou hast many righteous.—Well for thee,— That salt preserves thee; more corrupted else, And therefore more obnoxious at this hour, Than Sodom in her day had power to be, For whom God heard his Abraham plead in vain. BOOK IV. THE WINTER EVENING. ARGUMENT OF THE FOURTH BOOK. The post comes in. The newspaper is read. The world contemplated at a distance. Address to Winter. The amusements of a rural winter evening compared with the fashionable ones. Address to Evening. A brown study. Fall of snow in the evening. The waggoner. A poor family-piece. The rural thief. Public houses. The multitude of them censured. The farmer's daughter, what she was. What she is. The simplicity of country manners almost lost. Causes of the change. Desertion of the country by the rich. Neglect of magistrates. The militia principally in fault. The new recruit, and his transformation. Reflection on bodies corporate. The love of rural objects natural to all, and never to be totally extinguished. Hark! 'tis the twanging horn! o'er yonder bridge That with its wearisome but needful length Bestrides the wintry flood, in which the moon Sees her unwrinkled face reflected bright; He comes, the herald of a noisy world, With spatter'd boots, strapp'd waist, and frozen locks, News from all nations lumbering at his back. True to his charge the close-pack'd load behind, Yet careless what he brings, his one concern Is to conduct it to the destined inn, And having dropp'd the expected bag—pass on. He whistles as he goes, light-hearted wretch, Cold and yet cheerful: messenger of grief Perhaps to thousands, and of joy to some, To him indifferent whether grief or joy. Houses in ashes, and the fall of stocks, Births, deaths, and marriages, epistles wet With tears that trickled down the writer's cheeks Fast as the periods from his fluent quill, Or charged with amorous sighs of absent swains Or nymphs responsive, equally affect His horse and him, unconscious of them all. But oh the important budget! usher'd in With such heart-shaking music, who can say What are its tidings? Have our troops awaked? Or do they still, as if with opium drugg'd, Snore to the murmurs of the Atlantic wave? Is India free? and does she wear her plumed And jewelled turban with a smile of peace, Or do we grind her still? The grand debate, The popular harangue, the tart reply, The logic and the wisdom and the wit And the loud laugh—I long to know them all; I burn to set the imprison'd wranglers free, And give them voice and utterance once again. Now stir the fire, and close the shutters fast, Let fall the curtains, wheel the sofa round, And while the bubbling and loud-hissing urn Throws up a steamy column, and the cups That cheer but not inebriate, wait on each, So let us welcome peaceful evening in. Not such his evening, who with shining face Sweats in the crowded theatre, and squeezed And bored with elbow-points through both his sides, Out-scolds the ranting actor on the stage. Nor his, who patient stands till his feet throb And his head thumps, to feed upon the breath Of patriots bursting with heroic rage, Or placemen, all tranquillity and smiles. This folio of four pages, happy work! Which not even critics criticise, that holds Inquisitive attention while I read Fast bound in chains of silence, which the fair, Though eloquent themselves, yet fear to break, What is it but a map of busy life, Its fluctuations and its vast concerns? Here runs the mountainous and craggy ridge That tempts ambition. On the summit, see, The seals of office glitter in his eyes; He climbs, he pants, he grasps them. At his heels, Close at his heels a demagogue ascends, And with a dexterous jerk soon twists him down And wins them, but to lose them in his turn. Here rills of oily eloquence in soft Mæanders lubricate the course they take; The modest speaker is ashamed and grieved To engross a moment's notice, and yet begs, Begs a propitious ear for his poor thoughts, However trivial all that he conceives. Sweet bashfulness! it claims, at least, this praise, The dearth of information and good sense That it foretells us, always comes to pass. Cataracts of declamation thunder here, There forests of no meaning spread the page In which all comprehension wanders lost; While fields of pleasantry amuse us there, With merry descants on a nation's woes. The rest appears a wilderness of strange But gay confusion, roses for the cheeks And lilies for the brows of faded age, Teeth for the toothless, ringlets for the bald, Heaven, earth, and ocean plunder'd of their sweets, Nectareous essences, Olympian dews, Sermons and city feasts and favourite airs, Æthereal journeys, submarine exploits, And Katterfelto with his hair on end At his own wonders, wondering for his bread. 'Tis pleasant through the loop-holes of retreat To peep at such a world. To see the stir Of the great Babel and not feel the crowd. To hear the roar she sends through all her gates At a safe distance, where the dying sound Falls a soft murmur on the uninjured ear. Thus sitting and surveying thus at ease The globe and its concerns, I seem advanced To some secure and more than mortal height, That liberates and exempts me from them all. It turns submitted to my view, turns round With all its generations; I behold The tumult and am still. The sound of war Has lost its terrors ere it reaches me, Grieves but alarms me not. I mourn the pride And avarice that make man a wolf to man, Hear the faint echo of those brazen throats By which he speaks the language of his heart, And sigh, but never tremble at the sound. He travels and expatiates, as the bee From flower to flower, so he from land to land; The manners, customs, policy of all Pay contribution to the store he gleans; He sucks intelligence in every clime, And spreads the honey of his deep research At his return, a rich repast for me. He travels, and I too. I tread his deck, Ascend his topmast, through his peering eyes Discover countries, with a kindred heart Suffer his woes and share in his escapes, While fancy, like the finger of a clock, Runs the great circuit, and is still at home. Oh Winter! ruler of the inverted year, Thy scatter'd hair with sleet like ashes fill'd, Thy breath congeal'd upon thy lips, thy cheeks Fringed with a beard made white with other snows Than those of age; thy forehead wrapt in clouds, A leafless branch thy sceptre, and thy throne A sliding car indebted to no wheels, But urged by storms along its slippery way; I love thee, all unlovely as thou seem'st, And dreaded as thou art. Thou hold'st the sun A prisoner in the yet undawning East, Shortening his journey between morn and noon, And hurrying him impatient of his stay Down to the rosy West. But kindly still Compensating his loss with added hours Of social converse and instructive ease, And gathering at short notice in one group The family dispersed, and fixing thought Not less dispersed by daylight and its cares. I crown thee King of intimate delights, Fire-side enjoyments, home-born happiness, And all the comforts that the lowly roof Of undisturb'd retirement, and the hours Of long uninterrupted evening know. No rattling wheels stop short before these gates. No powder'd pert proficient in the art Of sounding an alarm, assaults these doors Till the street rings. No stationary steeds Cough their own knell, while heedless of the sound The silent circle fan themselves, and quake. But here the needle plies its busy task, The pattern grows, the well-depicted flower Wrought patiently into the snowy lawn Unfolds its bosom, buds and leaves and sprigs And curling tendrils, gracefully disposed, Follow the nimble finger of the fair, A wreath that cannot fade, of flowers that blow With most success when all besides decay. The poet's or historian's page, by one Made vocal for the amusement of the rest; The sprightly lyre, whose treasure of sweet sounds The touch from many a trembling chord shakes out; And the clear voice symphonious, yet distinct, And in the charming strife triumphant still, Beguile the night, and set a keener edge On female industry; the threaded steel Flies swiftly, and unfelt the task proceeds. The volume closed, the customary rites Of the last meal commence. A Roman meal, Such as the mistress of the world once found Delicious, when her patriots of high note, Perhaps by moonlight, at their humble doors, And under an old oak's domestic shade, Enjoyed, spare feast! a radish and an egg. Discourse ensues, not trivial, yet not dull, Nor such as with a frown forbids the play Of fancy, or proscribes the sound of mirth. Nor do we madly, like an impious world, Who deem religion frenzy, and the God That made them an intruder on their joys, Start at his aweful name, or deem his praise A jarring note: themes of a graver tone Exciting oft our gratitude and love, While we retrace with memory's pointing wand That calls the past to our exact review, The dangers we have 'scaped, the broken snare, The disappointed foe, deliverance found Unlook'd for, life preserved and peace restored, Fruits of omnipotent eternal love. Oh evenings worthy of the Gods! exclaim'd The Sabine bard. Oh evenings, I reply, More to be prized and coveted than yours, As more illumined and with nobler truths, That I and mine and those we love, enjoy. Is Winter hideous in a garb like this? Needs he the tragic fur, the smoke of lamps, The pent-up breath of an unsavoury throng, To thaw him into feeling, or the smart And snappish dialogue that flippant wits Call comedy, to prompt him with a smile? The self-complacent actor when he views (Stealing a sidelong glance at a full house,) The slope of faces from the floor to the roof, (As if one master-spring control'd them all,) Relax'd into an universal grin, Sees not a countenance there that speaks a joy Half so refined or so sincere as ours. Cards were superfluous here, with all the tricks That idleness has ever yet contrived To fill the void of an unfurnish'd brain, To palliate dullness and give time a shove. Time as he passes us, has a dove's wing, Unsoiled and swift and of a silken sound. But the world's time, is Time in masquerade. Theirs, should I paint him, has his pinions fledged With motley plumes, and where the peacock shows His azure eyes, is tinctured black and red With spots quadrangular of diamond form, Ensanguined hearts, clubs typical of strife, And spades, the emblem of untimely graves. What should be, and what was an hour-glass once Becomes a dice-box, and a billiard mast Well does the work of his destructive scythe. Thus deck'd he charms a world whom fashion blinds To his true worth, most pleased when idle most, Whose only happy are their wasted hours. Even misses, at whose age their mothers wore The back-string and the bib, assume the dress Of womanhood, sit pupils in the school Of card-devoted time, and night by night Placed at some vacant corner of the board, Learn every trick, and soon play all the game. But truce with censure. Roving as I rove, Where shall I find an end, or how proceed? As he that travels far, oft turns aside To view some rugged rock or mouldering tower, Which seen delights him not; then coming home, Describes and prints it, that the world may know How far he went for what was nothing worth; So I with brush in hand and pallet spread With colours mixt for a far different use, Paint cards and dolls, and every idle thing That fancy finds in her excursive flights. Come evening once again, season of peace, Return sweet evening, and continue long! Methinks I see thee in the streaky west, With matron-step slow-moving, while the night Treads on thy sweeping train; one hand employ'd In letting fall the curtain of repose On bird and beast, the other charged for man With sweet oblivion of the cares of day; Not sumptuously adorn'd, nor needing aid Like homely-featured night, of clustering gems, A star or two just twinkling on thy brow Suffices thee; save that the moon is thine No less than hers, not worn indeed on high With ostentatious pageantry, but set With modest grandeur in thy purple zone, Resplendent less, but of an ampler round. Come then, and thou shalt find thy votary calm Or make me so. Composure is thy gift. And whether I devote thy gentle hours To books, to music, or the poet's toil, To weaving nets for bird-alluring fruit; Or twining silken threads round ivory reels When they command whom man was born to please, I slight thee not, but make thee welcome still. Just when our drawing-rooms begin to blaze With lights by clear reflection multiplied From many a mirror, in which he of Gath, Goliath, might have seen his giant bulk Whole without stooping, towering crest and all, My pleasures too begin. But me perhaps The glowing hearth may satisfy awhile With faint illumination that uplifts The shadow to the ceiling, there by fits Dancing uncouthly to the quivering flame. Not undelightful is an hour to me So spent in parlour twilight; such a gloom Suits well the thoughtful or unthinking mind, The mind contemplative, with some new theme Pregnant, or indisposed alike to all. Laugh ye, who boast your more mercurial powers, That never feel a stupor, know no pause Nor need one. I am conscious, and confess Fearless, a soul that does not always think. Me oft has fancy ludicrous and wild Sooth'd with a waking dream of houses, towers, Trees, churches, and strange visages express'd In the red cinders, while with poring eye I gazed, myself creating what I saw. Nor less amused have I quiescent watch'd The sooty films that play upon the bars Pendulous, and foreboding in the view Of superstition prophesying still Though still deceived, some stranger's near approach. 'Tis thus the understanding takes repose In indolent vacuity of thought, And sleeps and is refresh'd. Meanwhile the face Conceals the mood lethargic with a mask Of deep deliberation, as the man Were task'd to his full strength, absorb'd and lost. Thus oft reclined at ease, I lose an hour At evening, till at length the freezing blast That sweeps the bolted shutter, summons home The recollected powers, and snapping short The glassy threads with which the fancy weaves Her brittle toys, restores me to myself. How calm is my recess! and how the frost Raging abroad, and the rough wind, endear The silence and the warmth enjoy'd within! I saw the woods and fields at close of day A variegated show; the meadows green Though faded, and the lands where lately waved The golden harvest, of a mellow brown, Upturn'd so lately by the forceful share. I saw far off the weedy fallows smile With verdure not unprofitable, grazed By flocks fast feeding, and selecting each His favourite herb; while all the leafless groves That skirt the horizon wore a sable hue, Scarce noticed in the kindred dusk of eve. To-morrow brings a change, a total change! Which even now, though silently perform'd And slowly, and by most unfelt, the face Of universal nature undergoes. Fast falls a fleecy shower. The downy flakes Descending and with never-ceasing lapse Softly alighting upon all below, Assimilate all objects. Earth receives Gladly the thickening mantle, and the green And tender blade that fear'd the chilling blast, Escapes unhurt beneath so warm a veil. In such a world, so thorny, and where none Finds happiness unblighted, or if found, Without some thistly sorrow at its side, It seems the part of wisdom, and no sin Against the law of love, to measure lots With less distinguish'd than ourselves, that thus We may with patience bear our moderate ills, And sympathize with others, suffering more. Ill fares the traveller now, and he that stalks In ponderous boots beside his reeking team. The wain goes heavily, impeded sore By congregated loads adhering close To the clogg'd wheels; and in its sluggish pace Noiseless appears a moving hill of snow. The toiling steeds expand the nostril wide, While every breath by respiration strong Forced downward, is consolidated soon Upon their jutting chests. He, form'd to bear The pelting brunt of the tempestuous night, With half-shut eyes and pucker'd cheeks, and teeth Presented bare against the storm, plods on. One hand secures his hat, save when with both He brandishes his pliant length of whip, Resounding oft, and never heard in vain. Oh happy! and in my account, denied That sensibility of pain with which Refinement is endued, thrice happy thou. Thy frame robust and hardy, feels indeed The piercing cold, but feels it unimpair'd. The learned finger never need explore Thy vigorous pulse; and the unhealthful East, That breathes the spleen, and searches every bone Of the infirm, is wholesome air to thee. Thy days roll on exempt from household care; Thy waggon is thy wife; and the poor beasts That drag the dull companion to and fro, Thine helpless charge, dependent on thy care. Ah treat them kindly! rude as thou appear'st Yet show that thou hast mercy, which the great With needless hurry whirl'd from place to place, Humane as they would seem, not always show. Poor, yet industrious, modest, quiet, neat, Such claim compassion in a night like this, And have a friend in every feeling heart. Warm'd, while it lasts, by labour, all day long They brave the season, and yet find at eve Ill clad and fed, but sparely time to cool. The frugal housewife trembles when she lights Her scanty stock of brush-wood, blazing clear But dying soon, like all terrestrial joys. The few small embers left she nurses well, And while her infant race with outspread hands And crowded knees sit cowering o'er the sparks, Retires, content to quake, so they be warm'd. The man feels least, as more inured than she To winter, and the current in his veins More briskly moved by his severer toil; Yet he too finds his own distress in theirs. The taper soon extinguished, which I saw Dangled along at the cold fingers' end Just when the day declined, and the brown loaf Lodged on the shelf half-eaten without sauce Of savoury cheese, or butter costlier still, Sleep seems their only refuge. For alas! Where penury is felt the thought is chain'd, And sweet colloquial pleasures are but few. With all this thrift they thrive not. All the care Ingenious parsimony takes, but just Saves the small inventory, bed and stool, Skillet and old carved chest, from public sale. They live, and live without extorted alms From grudging hands, but other boast have none To soothe their honest pride that scorns to beg, Nor comfort else, but in their mutual love. I praise you much, ye meek and patient pair, For ye are worthy; chusing rather far A dry but independent crust, hard-earn'd And eaten with a sigh, than to endure The rugged frowns and insolent rebuffs Of knaves in office, partial in the work Of distribution; liberal of their aid To clamorous importunity in rags, But oft-times deaf to suppliants who would blush To wear a tatter'd garb however coarse, Whom famine cannot reconcile to filth; These ask with painful shyness, and refused Because deserving, silently retire. But be ye of good courage. Time itself Shall much befriend you. Time shall give increase, And all your numerous progeny well train'd, But helpless, in few years shall find their hands, And labour too. Meanwhile ye shall not want What conscious of your virtues we can spare, Nor what a wealthier than ourselves may send. I mean the man, who, when the distant poor Need help, denies them nothing but his name. But poverty with most who whimper forth Their long complaints, is self-inflicted woe, The effect of laziness or sottish waste. Now goes the nightly thief prowling abroad For plunder; much solicitous how best He may compensate for a day of sloth, By works of darkness and nocturnal wrong. Woe to the gardener's pale, the farmer's hedge Plash'd neatly, and secured with driven stakes Deep in the loamy bank! Uptorn by strength Resistless in so bad a cause, but lame To better deeds, he bundles up the spoil An ass's burthen, and when laden most And heaviest, light of foot steals fast away. Nor does the boarded hovel better guard The well-stack'd pile of riven logs and roots From his pernicious force. Nor will he leave Unwrench'd the door however well secured, Where chanticleer amidst his haram sleeps In unsuspecting pomp. Twitched from the perch He gives the princely bird with all his wives To his voracious bag, struggling in vain, And loudly wondering at the sudden change. Nor this to feed his own. 'Twere some excuse Did pity of their sufferings warp aside His principle, and tempt him into sin For their support, so destitute. But they Neglected pine at home, themselves, as more Exposed than others, with less scruple made His victims, robb'd of their defenceless all. Cruel is all he does. 'Tis quenchless thirst Of ruinous ebriety that prompts His every action and imbrutes the man. Oh for a law to noose the villain's neck Who starves his own! who persecutes the blood He gave them in his children's veins, and hates And wrongs the woman he has sworn to love. Pass where we may, through city or through town, Village or hamlet of this merry land Though lean and beggar'd, every twentieth pace Conducts the unguarded nose to such a whiff Of stale debauch forth issuing from the styes That law has licensed, as makes temperance reel. There sit involved and lost in curling clouds Of Indian fume, and guzzling deep, the boor, The lacquey, and the groom. The craftsman there Takes a Lethæan leave of all his toil; Smith, cobler, joiner, he that plies the sheers, And he that kneads the dough; all loud alike, All learned, and all drunk. The fiddle screams Plaintive and piteous, as it wept and wailed Its wasted tones and harmony unheard. Fierce the dispute whate'er the theme. While she, Fell Discord, arbitress of such debate, Perch'd on the sign-post, holds with even hand Her undecisive scales. In this she lays A weight of ignorance, in that, of pride, And smiles delighted with the eternal poise. Dire is the frequent curse and its twin sound The cheek-distending oath, not to be praised As ornamental, musical, polite, Like those which modern senators employ, Whose oath is rhetoric, and who swear for fame. Behold the schools in which plebeian minds, Once simple, are initiated in arts Which some may practise with politer grace, But none with readier skill! 'Tis here they learn The road that leads from competence and peace To indigence and rapine; till at last Society, grown weary of the load, Shakes her encumber'd lap, and casts them out. But censure profits little. Vain the attempt To advertise in verse a public pest, That, like the filth with which the peasant feeds His hungry acres, stinks, and is of use. The excise is fatten'd with the rich result Of all this riot. And ten thousand casks, For ever dribbling out their base contents, Touch'd by the Midas finger of the state, Bleed gold for Ministers to sport away. Drink and be mad then! 'Tis your country bids. Gloriously drunk obey the important call; Her cause demands the assistance of your throats, Ye all can swallow, and she asks no more. Would I had fallen upon those happier days That poets celebrate! those golden times And those Arcadian scenes that Maro sings, And Sydney, warbler of poetic prose. Nymphs were Dianas then, and swains had hearts That felt their virtues. Innocence it seems, From courts dismiss'd, found shelter in the groves. The footsteps of simplicity impress'd Upon the yielding herbage (so they sing,) Then were not all effaced. Then speech profane And manners profligate were rarely found, Observed as prodigies, and soon reclaim'd. Vain wish! those days were never. Airy dreams Sat for the picture; and the poet's hand Imparting substance to an empty shade, Imposed a gay delirium for a truth. Grant it. I still must envy them an age That favour'd such a dream, in days like these Impossible, when virtue is so scarce, That to suppose a scene where she presides Is tramontane, and stumbles all belief. No. We are polish'd now. The rural lass, Whom once her virgin modesty and grace, Her artless manners and her neat attire So dignified, that she was hardly less Than the fair shepherdess of old romance, Is seen no more. The character is lost. Her head adorn'd with lappets pinn'd aloft And ribbands streaming gay, superbly raised And magnified beyond all human size, Indebted to some smart wig-weaver's hand For more than half the tresses it sustains; Her elbows ruffled, and her tottering form Ill propp'd upon French heels; she might be deemed (But that the basket dangling on her arm Interprets her more truly,) of a rank Too proud for dairy-work or sale of eggs. Expect her soon with footboy at her heels, No longer blushing for her awkward load, Her train and her umbrella all her care. The town has tinged the country. And the stain Appears a spot upon a vestal's robe, The worse for what it soils. The fashion runs Down into scenes still rural, but alas! Scenes rarely graced with rural manners now. Time was when in the pastoral retreat The unguarded door was safe. Men did not watch To invade another's right, or guard their own. Then sleep was undisturb'd by fear, unscared By drunken howlings; and the chilling tale Of midnight murther was a wonder heard With doubtful credit, told to frighten babes. But farewell now to unsuspicious nights And slumbers unalarm'd. Now ere you sleep See that your polish'd arms be primed with care, And drop the night-bolt. Ruffians are abroad; And the first larum of the cock's shrill throat May prove a trumpet, summoning your ear To horrid sounds of hostile feet within. Even daylight has its dangers. And the walk Through pathless wastes and woods, unconscious once Of other tenants than melodious birds Or harmless flocks, is hazardous and bold. Lamented change! to which full many a cause Inveterate, hopeless of a cure, conspires. The course of human things from good to ill, From ill to worse, is fatal, never fails. Increase of power begets increase of wealth, Wealth luxury, and luxury excess; Excess, the scrofulous and itchy plague That seizes first the opulent, descends To the next rank contagious, and in time Taints downward all the graduated scale Of order, from the chariot to the plough. The rich, and they that have an arm to check The licence of the lowest in degree, Desert their office; and themselves intent On pleasure, haunt the capital, and thus To all the violence of lawless hands Resign the scenes their presence might protect. Authority herself not seldom sleeps, Though resident, and witness of the wrong. The plump convivial parson often bears The magisterial sword in vain, and lays His reverence and his worship both to rest On the same cushion of habitual sloth. Perhaps timidity restrains his arm; When he should strike, he trembles, and sets free, Himself enslaved by terror of the band, The audacious convict whom he dares not bind. Perhaps, though by profession ghostly pure, He too may have his vice, and sometimes prove Less dainty than becomes his grave outside, In lucrative concerns. Examine well His milk-white hand. The palm is hardly clean,— But here and there an ugly smutch appears. Foh! 'twas a bribe that left it. He has touched Corruption. Whoso seeks an audit here Propitious, pays his tribute, game or fish, Wildfowl or venison, and his errand speeds. But faster far and more than all the rest A noble cause, which none who bears a spark Of public virtue ever wish'd removed, Works the deplored and mischievous effect. 'Tis universal soldiership has stabb'd The heart of merit in the meaner class. Arms, through the vanity and brainless rage Of those that bear them, in whatever cause, Seem most at variance with all moral good, And incompatible with serious thought. The clown, the child of nature, without guile, Blest with an infant's ignorance of all But his own simple pleasures, now and then A wrestling match, a foot-race, or a fair, Is ballotted, and trembles at the news. Sheepish he doffs his hat, and mumbling swears A Bible-oath to be whate'er they please, To do he knows not what. The task perform'd, That instant he becomes the serjeant's care, His pupil, and his torment, and his jest. His awkward gait, his introverted toes, Bent knees, round shoulders, and dejected looks, Procure him many a curse. By slow degrees, Unapt to learn and formed of stubborn stuff, He yet by slow degrees puts off himself, Grows conscious of a change, and likes it well. He stands erect, his slouch becomes a walk, He steps right onward, martial in his air His form and movement; is as smart above As meal and larded locks can make him; wears His hat or his plumed helmet with a grace, And his three years of heroship expired, Returns indignant to the slighted plough. He hates the field in which no fife or drum Attends him, drives his cattle to a march, And sighs for the smart comrades he has left. 'Twere well if his exterior change were all,— But with his clumsy port the wretch has lost His ignorance and harmless manners too. To swear, to game, to drink, to show at home By lewdness, idleness, and sabbath-breach, The great proficiency he made abroad, To astonish and to grieve his gazing friends, To break some maiden's and his mother's heart, To be a pest where he was useful once, Are his sole aim and all his glory now. Man in society is like a flower Blown in its native bed. 'Tis there alone His faculties expanded in full bloom Shine out, there only reach their proper use. But man associated and leagued with man By regal warrant, or self-joined by bond For interest-sake, or swarming into clans Beneath one head for purposes of war, Like flowers selected from the rest, and bound And bundled close to fill some crowded vase, Fades rapidly, and by compression marred Contracts defilement not to be endured. Hence charter'd boroughs are such public plagues, And burghers, men immaculate perhaps In all their private functions, once combined, Become a loathsome body, only fit For dissolution, hurtful to the main. Hence merchants, unimpeachable of sin Against the charities of domestic life, Incorporated, seem at once to lose Their nature, and disclaiming all regard For mercy and the common rights of man, Build factories with blood, conducting trade At the sword's point, and dying the white robe Of innocent commercial justice red. Hence too the field of glory, as the world Misdeems it, dazzled by its bright array, With all the majesty of its thundering pomp, Enchanting music and immortal wreaths, Is but a school where thoughtlessness is taught On principle, where foppery atones For folly, gallantry for every vice. But slighted as it is, and by the great Abandon'd, and, which still I more regret, Infected with the manners and the modes It knew not once, the country wins me still. I never framed a wish, or form'd a plan That flatter'd me with hopes of earthly bliss, But there I laid the scene. There early stray'd My fancy, ere yet liberty of choice Had found me, or the hope of being free. My very dreams were rural, rural too The first-born efforts of my youthful muse, Sportive, and jingling her poetic bells Ere yet her ear was mistress of their powers. No bard could please me but whose lyre was tuned To Nature's praises. Heroes and their feats Fatigued me, never weary of the pipe Of Tityrus, assembling as he sang The rustic throng beneath his favourite beech. Then Milton had indeed a poet's charms. New to my taste, his Paradise surpass'd The struggling efforts of my boyish tongue To speak its excellence; I danced for joy. I marvel'd much that at so ripe an age As twice seven years, his beauties had then first Engaged my wonder, and admiring still And still admiring, with regret supposed The joy half lost because not sooner found. Thee too enamour'd of the life I loved, Pathetic in its praise, in its pursuit Determined, and possessing it at last With transports such as favour'd lovers feel, I studied, prized, and wish'd that I had known, Ingenious Cowley! and though now, reclaim'd By modern lights from an erroneous taste, I cannot but lament thy splendid wit Entangled in the cobwebs of the schools, I still revere thee, courtly though retired, Though stretch'd at ease in Chertsey's silent bowers Not unemploy'd, and finding rich amends For a lost world in solitude and verse. 'Tis born with all. The love of Nature's works Is an ingredient in the compound, man, Infused at the creation of the kind. And though the Almighty Maker has throughout Discriminated each from each, by strokes And touches of his hand with so much art Diversified, that two were never found Twins at all points,—yet this obtains in all, That all discern a beauty in his works And all can taste them. Minds that have been form'd And tutor'd, with a relish more exact, But none without some relish, none unmoved. It is a flame that dies not even there Where nothing feeds it. Neither business, crowds, Nor habits of luxurious city life, Whatever else they smother of true worth In human bosoms, quench it or abate. The villas with which London stands begirt Like a swarth Indian with his belt of beads, Prove it. A breath of unadulterate air, The glimpse of a green pasture, how they cheer The citizen, and brace his languid frame! Even in the stifling bosom of the town, A garden in which nothing thrives, has charms That soothe the rich possessor; much consoled That here and there some sprigs of mournful mint, Of nightshade or valerian, grace the well He cultivates. These serve him with a hint That Nature lives, that sight-refreshing green Is still the livery she delights to wear, Though sickly samples of the exuberant whole. What are the casements lined with creeping herbs, The prouder sashes fronted with a range Of orange, myrtle, or the fragrant weed The Frenchman's darling? are they not all proofs That man, immured in cities, still retains His inborn inextinguishable thirst Of rural scenes, compensating his loss By supplemental shifts, the best he may? The most unfurnished with the means of life, And they that never pass their brick-wall bounds To range the fields and treat their lungs with air, Yet feel the burning instinct; over head Suspend their crazy boxes planted thick And water'd duly. There the pitcher stands A fragment, and the spoutless tea-pot there; Sad witnesses how close-pent man regrets The country, with what ardour he contrives A peep at nature, when he can no more. Hail, therefore, patroness of health and ease And contemplation, heart-consoling joys And harmless pleasures, in the throng'd abode Of multitudes unknown, hail rural life! Address himself who will to the pursuit Of honours or emolument or fame, I shall not add myself to such a chace, Thwart his attempts, or envy his success. Some must be great. Great offices will have Great talents. And God gives to every man The virtue, temper, understanding, taste, That lifts him into life, and lets him fall Just in the niche he was ordain'd to fill. To the deliverer of an injured land He gives a tongue to enlarge upon, an heart To feel, and courage to redress her wrongs; To monarchs dignity, to judges sense, To artists ingenuity and skill; To me an unambitious mind, content In the low vale of life, that early felt A wish for ease and leisure, and ere long Found here that leisure and that ease I wish'd.

'Tis morning; and the sun with ruddy orb Ascending fires the horizon: while the clouds That crowd away before the driving wind, More ardent as the disk emerges more, Resemble most some city in a blaze, Seen through the leafless wood. His slanting ray Slides ineffectual down the snowy vale, And tinging all with his own rosy hue, From every herb and every spiry blade Stretches a length of shadow o'er the field. Mine, spindling into longitude immense, In spite of gravity and sage remark That I myself am but a fleeting shade, Provokes me to a smile. With eye askance I view the muscular proportioned limb Transformed to a lean shank. The shapeless pair As they designed to mock me, at my side Take step for step, and as I near approach The cottage, walk along the plaster'd wall, Preposterous sight! the legs without the man. The verdure of the plain lies buried deep Beneath the dazzling deluge; and the bents And coarser grass upspearing o'er the rest, Of late unsightly and unseen, now shine Conspicuous, and in bright apparel clad And fledged with icy feathers, nod superb. The cattle mourn in corners where the fence Screens them, and seem half petrified to sleep In unrecumbent sadness. There they wait Their wonted fodder, not like hungering man Fretful if unsupplied, but silent, meek, And patient of the slow-paced swain's delay. He from the stack carves out the accustomed load, Deep plunging and again deep plunging oft His broad keen knife into the solid mass. Smooth as a wall the upright remnant stands, With such undeviating and even force He severs it away: no needless care, Lest storms should overset the leaning pile Deciduous, or its own unbalanced weight. Forth goes the woodman, leaving unconcerned The cheerful haunts of man, to wield the axe And drive the wedge in yonder forest drear, From morn to eve his solitary task. Shaggy and lean and shrewd, with pointed ears And tail cropp'd short, half lurcher and half cur His dog attends him. Close behind his heel Now creeps he slow, and now with many a frisk Wide-scampering snatches up the drifted snow With ivory teeth, or ploughs it with his snout; Then shakes his powder'd coat and barks for joy. Heedless of all his pranks the sturdy churl Moves right toward the mark; nor stops for aught, But now and then with pressure of his thumb To adjust the fragrant charge of a short tube That fumes beneath his nose: the trailing cloud Streams far behind him, scenting all the air. Now from the roost or from the neighbouring pale, Where diligent to catch the first faint gleam Of smiling day, they gossipp'd side by side, Come trooping at the housewife's well-known call The feather'd tribes domestic. Half on wing And half on foot, they brush the fleecy flood Conscious, and fearful of too deep a plunge. The sparrows peep, and quit the sheltering eaves To seize the fair occasion. Well they eye The scatter'd grain, and thievishly resolved To escape the impending famine, often scared As oft return, a pert voracious kind. Clean riddance quickly made, one only care Remains to each, the search of sunny nook, Or shed impervious to the blast. Resign'd To sad necessity the cock foregoes His wonted strut, and wading at their head With well-considered steps, seems to resent His alter'd gait and stateliness retrenched. How find the myriads that in summer cheer The hills and vallies with their ceaseless songs Due sustenance, or where subsist they now? Earth yields them nought: the imprison'd worm is safe Beneath the frozen clod; all seeds of herbs Lie covered close, and berry-bearing thorns That feed the thrush, (whatever some suppose,) Afford the smaller minstrels no supply. The long protracted rigour of the year Thins all their numerous flocks. In chinks and holes Ten thousand seek an unmolested end As instinct prompts, self buried ere they die. The very rooks and daws forsake the fields, Where neither grub nor root nor earth-nut now Repays their labour more; and perch'd aloft By the way-side, or stalking in the path, Lean pensioners upon the traveller's track, Pick up their nauseous dole, though sweet to them, Of voided pulse or half digested grain. The streams are lost amid the splendid blank O'erwhelming all distinction. On the flood Indurated and fixt, the snowy weight Lies undissolved, while silently beneath And unperceived the current steals away. Not so, where scornful of a check it leaps The mill-dam, dashes on the restless wheel, And wantons in the pebbly gulf below. No frost can bind it there. Its utmost force Can but arrest the light and smoky mist That in its fall the liquid sheet throws wide. And see where it has hung the embroidered banks With forms so various, that no powers of art, The pencil or the pen, may trace the scene! Here glittering turrets rise, upbearing high (Fantastic misarrangement,) on the roof Large growth of what may seem the sparkling trees And shrubs of fairy land. The chrystal drops That trickle down the branches, fast congeal'd Shoot into pillars of pellucid length, And prop the pile they but adorned before. Here grotto within grotto safe defies The sun-beam. There emboss'd and fretted wild The growing wonder takes a thousand shapes Capricious, in which fancy seeks in vain The likeness of some object seen before. Thus nature works as if to mock at art, And in defiance of her rival powers; By these fortuitous and random strokes Performing such inimitable feats As she with all her rules can never reach. Less worthy of applause though more admired, Because a novelty, the work of man, Imperial mistress of the fur-clad Russ! Thy most magnificent and mighty freak, The wonder of the north. No forest fell When thou would'st build; no quarry sent its stores To enrich thy walls: but thou didst hew the floods, And make thy marble of the glassy wave. In such a palace Aristæus found Cyrene, when he bore the plaintive tale Of his lost bees to her maternal ear. In such a palace poetry might place The armoury of Winter, where his troops The gloomy clouds find weapons, arrowy sleet Skin-piercing volley, blossom-bruising hail, And snow that often blinds the traveller's course, And wraps him in an unexpected tomb. Silently as a dream the fabric rose. No sound of hammer or of saw was there. Ice upon ice, the well-adjusted parts Were soon conjoined, nor other cement ask'd Than water interfused to make them one. Lamps gracefully disposed and of all hues Illumined every side. A watery light Gleamed through the clear transparency, that seemed Another moon new-risen, or meteor fallen From heaven to earth, of lambent flame serene. So stood the brittle prodigy, though smooth And slippery the materials, yet frost-bound Firm as a rock. Nor wanted aught within That royal residence might well befit, For grandeur or for use. Long wavy wreaths Of flowers that feared no enemy but warmth, Blushed on the pannels. Mirror needed none Where all was vitreous, but in order due Convivial table and commodious seat (What seemed at least commodious seat,) were there, Sofa and couch and high-built throne august. The same lubricity was found in all, And all was moist to the warm touch, a scene Of evanescent glory, once a stream, And soon to slide into a stream again. Alas! 'twas but a mortifying stroke Of undesigned severity, that glanced (Made by a monarch,) on her own estate, On human grandeur and the courts of kings. 'Twas transient in its nature, as in show 'Twas durable. As worthless as it seemed Intrinsically precious: to the foot Treacherous and false, it smiled and it was cold. Great princes have great playthings. Some have played At hewing mountains into men, and some At building human wonders mountain-high. Some have amused the dull sad years of life, Life spent in indolence, and therefore sad, With schemes of monumental fame, and sought By pyramids and mausolean pomp, Short-lived themselves, to immortalize their bones. Some seek diversion in the tented field, And make the sorrows of mankind their sport. But war's a game, which were their subjects wise, Kings should not play at. Nations would do well To extort their truncheons from the puny hands Of heroes, whose infirm and baby minds Are gratified with mischief, and who spoil Because men suffer it, their toy the world. When Babel was confounded, and the great Confederacy of projectors wild and vain Was split into diversity of tongues, Then, as a shepherd separates his flock, These to the upland, to the valley those, God drave asunder and assigned their lot To all the nations. Ample was the boon He gave them, in its distribution fair And equal, and he bade them dwell in peace. Peace was awhile their care. They plough'd and sow'd And reap'd their plenty without grudge or strife. But violence can never longer sleep Than human passions please. In every heart Are sown the sparks that kindle fiery war, Occasion needs but fan them, and they blaze. Cain had already shed a brother's blood; The deluge wash'd it out; but left unquenched The seeds of murder in the breast of man. Soon, by a righteous judgement, in the line Of his descending progeny was found The first artificer of death; the shrewd Contriver who first sweated at the forge, And forced the blunt and yet unblooded steel To a keen edge, and made it bright for war. Him Tubal named, the Vulcan of old times, The sword and falchion their inventor claim, And the first smith was the first murderer's son. His art survived the waters; and ere long When man was multiplied and spread abroad In tribes and clans, and had begun to call These meadows and that range of hills his own, The tasted sweets of property begat Desire of more; and industry in some To improve and cultivate their just demesne, Made others covet what they saw so fair. Thus wars began on earth. These fought for spoil, And those in self-defence. Savage at first The onset, and irregular. At length One eminent above the rest, for strength, For stratagem or courage, or for all, Was chosen leader. Him they served in war, And him in peace for sake of warlike deeds Reverenced no less. Who could with him compare? Or who so worthy to controul themselves As he whose prowess had subdued their foes? Thus war affording field for the display Of virtue, made one chief, whom times of peace, Which have their exigencies too, and call For skill in government, at length made king. King was a name too proud for man to wear With modesty and weakness; and the crown, So dazzling in their eyes who set it on, Was sure to intoxicate the brows it bound. It is the abject property of most, That being parcel of the common mass, And destitute of means to raise themselves, They sink and settle lower than they need. They know not what it is to feel within A comprehensive faculty that grasps Great purposes with ease, that turns and wields, Almost without an effort, plans too vast For their conception, which they cannot move. Conscious of impotence they soon grow drunk With gazing, when they see an able man Step forth to notice; and besotted thus Build him a pedestal, and say, Stand there, And be our admiration and our praise! They roll themselves before him in the dust, Then most deserving in their own account When most extravagant in his applause, As if exalting him they raised themselves. Thus by degrees self-cheated of their sound And sober judgement that he is but man, They demi-deify and fume him so That in due season he forgets it too. Inflated and astrut with self-conceit He gulps the windy diet, and ere long Adopting their mistake, profoundly thinks The world was made in vain if not for him. Thenceforth they are his cattle: drudges born To bear his burthens, drawing in his gears And sweating in his service. His caprice Becomes the soul that animates them all. He deems a thousand or ten thousand lives Spent in the purchase of renown for him An easy reckoning, and they think the same. Thus kings were first invented, and thus kings Were burnished into heroes, and became The arbiters of this terraqueous swamp, Storks among frogs, that have but croak'd and died. Strange that such folly as lifts bloated man To eminence fit only for a God, Should ever drivel out of human lips Even in the cradled weakness of the world! Still stranger much, that when at length mankind Had reached the sinewy firmness of their youth, And could discriminate and argue well On subjects more mysterious, they were yet Babes in the cause of freedom, and should fear And quake before the Gods themselves had made. But above measure strange, that neither proof Of sad experience, nor examples set By some whose patriot virtue has prevailed, Can even now, when they are grown mature In wisdom, and with philosophic deeps Familiar, serve to emancipate the rest! Such dupes are men to custom, and so prone To reverence what is ancient and can plead A course of long observance for its use, That even servitude, the worst of ills, Because deliver'd down from sire to son, Is kept and guarded as a sacred thing. But is it fit, or can it bear the shock Of rational discussion, that a man, Compounded and made up like other men Of elements tumultuous, in whom lust And folly in as ample measure meet As in the bosoms of the slaves he rules, Should be a despot absolute, and boast Himself the only freeman of his land? Should when he pleases, and on whom he will, Wage war, with any or with no pretence Of provocation given or wrong sustained, And force the beggarly last doit, by means That his own humour dictates, from the clutch Of poverty, that thus he may procure His thousands, weary of penurious life, A splendid opportunity to die? Say ye, who (with less prudence than of old Jotham ascribed to his assembled trees In politic convention,) put your trust In the shadow of a bramble, and reclined In fancied peace beneath his dangerous branch, Rejoice in him and celebrate his sway, Where find ye passive fortitude? Whence springs Your self-denying zeal that holds it good To stroke the prickly grievance, and to hang His thorns with streamers of continual praise? We too are friends to loyalty. We love The king who loves the law, respects his bounds, And reigns content within them. Him we serve Freely and with delight, who leaves us free. But recollecting still that he is man, We trust him not too far. King though he be, And king in England too, he may be weak And vain enough to be ambitious still, May exercise amiss his proper powers, Or covet more than freemen choose to grant: Beyond that mark is treason. He is ours, To administer, to guard, to adorn the state, But not to warp or change it. We are his, To serve him nobly in the common cause True to the death, but not to be his slaves. Mark now the difference, ye that boast your love Of kings, between your loyalty and ours. We love the man; the paltry pageant you. We the chief patron of the commonwealth; You the regardless author of its woes. We for the sake of liberty, a king; You chains and bondage for a tyrant's sake. Our love is principle, and has its root In reason, is judicious, manly, free; Yours, a blind instinct, crouches to the rod, And licks the foot that treads it in the dust. Were kingship as true treasure as it seems, Sterling, and worthy of a wise man's wish, I would not be a king to be beloved Causeless, and daub'd with undiscerning praise, Where love is mere attachment to the throne, Not to the man who fills it as he ought. Whose freedom is by sufferance, and at will Of a superior, he is never free. Who lives, and is not weary of a life Exposed to manacles, deserves them well. The state that strives for liberty, though foiled And forced to abandon what she bravely sought, Deserves at least applause for her attempt, And pity for her loss. But that's a cause Not often unsuccessful; power usurp'd Is weakness when opposed; conscious of wrong 'Tis pusillanimous and prone to flight. But slaves that once conceive the glowing thought Of freedom, in that hope itself possess All that the contest calls for; spirit, strength, The scorn of danger, and united hearts The surest presage of the good they seek. Then shame to manhood, and opprobrious more To France, than all her losses and defeats Old or of later date, by sea or land, Her house of bondage worse than that of old Which God avenged on Pharaoh,—the Bastile. Ye horrid towers, the abode of broken hearts, Ye dungeons and ye cages of despair, That monarchs have supplied from age to age With music such as suits their sovereign ears, The sighs and groans of miserable men! There's not an English heart that would not leap To hear that ye were fallen at last, to know That even our enemies, so oft employed In forging chains for us, themselves were free. For he that values liberty, confines His zeal for her predominance within No narrow bounds; her cause engages him Wherever pleaded. 'Tis the cause of man. There dwell the most forlorn of human kind, Immured though unaccused, condemn'd untried, Cruelly spared, and hopeless of escape. There like the visionary emblem seen By him of Babylon, life stands a stump, And filletted about with hoops of brass, Still lives, though all its pleasant boughs are gone. To count the hour-bell and expect no change; And ever as the sullen sound is heard, Still to reflect that though a joyless note To him whose moments all have one dull pace, Ten thousand rovers in the world at large Account it music; that it summons some To theatre or jocund feast or ball; The wearied hireling finds it a release From labour; and the lover that has chid Its long delay, feels every welcome stroke Upon his heart-strings trembling with delight:— To fly for refuge from distracting thought To such amusements as ingenious woe Contrives, hard-shifting and without her tools;— To read engraven on the mouldy walls, In staggering types, his predecessor's tale, A sad memorial, and subjoin his own:— To turn purveyor to an overgorged And bloated spider, till the pamper'd pest Is made familiar, watches his approach, Comes at his call, and serves him for a friend:— To wear out time in numbering to and fro The studs that thick emboss his iron door, Then downward and then upward, then aslant And then alternate, with a sickly hope By dint of change to give his tasteless task Some relish, till the sum exactly found In all directions, he begins again:— Oh comfortless existence! hemm'd around With woes, which who that suffers, would not kneel And beg for exile, or the pangs of death? That man should thus encroach on fellow man, Abridge him of his just and native rights, Eradicate him, tear him from his hold Upon the endearments of domestic life And social, nip his fruitfulness and use, And doom him for perhaps an heedless word To barrenness and solitude and tears, Moves indignation; makes the name of king, (Of king whom such prerogative can please,) As dreadful as the Manichean God, Adored through fear, strong only to destroy. 'Tis liberty alone that gives the flower Of fleeting life its lustre and perfume, And we are weeds without it. All constraint, Except what wisdom lays on evil men, Is evil; hurts the faculties, impedes Their progress in the road of science; blinds The eyesight of discovery, and begets In those that suffer it, a sordid mind Bestial, a meagre intellect, unfit To be the tenant of man's noble form. Thee therefore still, blame-worthy as thou art, With all thy loss of empire, and though squeezed By public exigence till annual food Fails for the craving hunger of the state, Thee I account still happy, and the chief Among the nations, seeing thou art free! My native nook of earth! Thy clime is rude, Replete with vapours, and disposes much All hearts to sadness, and none more than mine; Thine unadulterate manners are less soft And plausible than social life requires, And thou hast need of discipline and art To give thee what politer France receives From Nature's bounty,—that humane address And sweetness, without which no pleasure is In converse, either starved by cold reserve, Or flush'd with fierce dispute, a senseless brawl; Yet being free, I love thee. For the sake Of that one feature, can be well content, Disgraced as thou hast been, poor as thou art, To seek no sublunary rest beside. But once enslaved, farewell! I could endure Chains no where patiently, and chains at home Where I am free by birthright, not at all. Then what were left of roughness in the grain Of British natures, wanting its excuse That it belongs to freemen, would disgust And shock me. I should then with double pain Feel all the rigour of thy fickle clime; And if I must bewail the blessing lost For which our Hampdens and our Sidneys bled, I would at least bewail it under skies Milder, among a people less austere, In scenes which, having never known me free, Would not reproach me with the loss I felt. Do I forebode impossible events, And tremble at vain dreams? Heaven grant I may! But the age of virtuous politics is past, And we are deep in that of cold pretence. Patriots are grown too shrewd to be sincere, And we too wise to trust them. He that takes Deep in his soft credulity the stamp Designed by loud declaimers on the part Of liberty, themselves the slaves of lust, Incurs derision for his easy faith And lack of knowledge, and with cause enough. For when was public virtue to be found Where private was not? Can he love the whole Who loves no part? he be a nation's friend Who is in truth the friend of no man there? Can he be strenuous in his country's cause, Who slights the charities for whose dear sake That country, if at all, must be beloved? 'Tis therefore, sober and good men are sad For England's glory, seeing it wax pale And sickly, while her champions wear their hearts So loose to private duty, that no brain, Healthful and undisturb'd by factious fumes, Can dream them trusty to the general weal. Such were not they of old, whose temper'd blades Dispersed the shackles of usurp'd controul, And hew'd them link from link. Then Albion's sons Were sons indeed. They felt a filial heart Beat high within them at a mother's wrongs, And shining each in his domestic sphere, Shone brighter still once call'd to public view. 'Tis therefore, many whose sequester'd lot Forbids their interference, looking on Anticipate perforce some dire event; And seeing the old castle of the state, That promised once more firmness, so assail'd That all its tempest-beaten turrets shake, Stand motionless expectants of its fall. All has its date below. The fatal hour Was register'd in heaven ere time began. We turn to dust, and all our mightiest works Die too. The deep foundations that we lay, Time ploughs them up, and not a trace remains. We build with what we deem eternal rock; A distant age asks where the fabric stood, And in the dust, sifted and search'd in vain, The undiscoverable secret sleeps. But there is yet a liberty unsung By poets, and by senators unpraised, Which monarchs cannot grant, nor all the power Of earth and hell confederate take away: A liberty, which persecution, fraud, Oppression, prisons, have no power to bind; Which whoso tastes can be enslaved no more. 'Tis liberty of heart derived from heaven, Bought with His blood who gave it to mankind, And seal'd with the same token. It is held By charter, and that charter sanction'd sure By the unimpeachable and aweful oath And promise of a God. His other gifts All bear the royal stamp that speaks them his, And are august, but this transcends them all. His other works, this visible display Of all-creating energy and might, Are grand no doubt, and worthy of the Word That finding an interminable space Unoccupied, has filled the void so well, And made so sparkling what was dark before. But these are not his glory. Man, 'tis true, Smit with the beauty of so fair a scene, Might well suppose the artificer divine Meant it eternal, had he not himself Pronounced it transient, glorious as it is, And still designing a more glorious far, Doom'd it as insufficient for his praise. These therefore are occasional and pass. Form'd for the confutation of the fool Whose lying heart disputes against a God, That office served, they must be swept away. Not so the labours of his love. They shine In other heavens than these that we behold, And fade not. There is paradise that fears No forfeiture, and of its fruits he sends Large prelibation oft to saints below. Of these the first in order, and the pledge And confident assurance of the rest, Is liberty; a flight into His arms Ere yet mortality's fine threads give way; A clear escape from tyrannizing lust, And full immunity from penal woe. Chains are the portion of revolted man, Stripes and a dungeon; and his body serves The triple purpose. In that sickly, foul, Opprobrious residence, he finds them all. Propense his heart to idols, he is held In silly dotage on created things, Careless of their Creator. And that low And sordid gravitation of his powers To a vile clod, so draws him with such force Resistless from the centre he should seek, That he at last forgets it. All his hopes Tend downward; his ambition is to sink, To reach a depth profounder still, and still Profounder, in the fathomless abyss Of folly, plunging in pursuit of death. But ere he gain the comfortless repose He seeks, an acquiescence of his soul In heaven-renouncing exile, he endures— What does he not? from lusts opposed in vain, And self-reproaching conscience. He foresees The fatal issue to his health, fame, peace, Fortune and dignity; the loss of all That can ennoble man, and make frail life Short as it is, supportable. Still worse, Far worse than all the plagues with which his sins Infect his happiest moments, he forebodes Ages of hopeless misery; future death, And death still future: not an hasty stroke Like that which sends him to the dusty grave, But unrepealable enduring death. Scripture is still a trumpet to his fears; What none can prove a forgery, may be true, What none but bad men wish exploded, must. That scruple checks him. Riot is not loud Nor drunk enough to drown it. In the midst Of laughter his compunctions are sincere, And he abhors the jest by which he shines. Remorse begets reform. His master-lust Falls first before his resolute rebuke, And seems dethroned and vanquish'd. Peace ensues, But spurious and short-lived, the puny child Of self-congratulating Pride, begot On fancied Innocence. Again he falls, And fights again; but finds his best essay A presage ominous, portending still Its own dishonour by a worse relapse. Till Nature, unavailing Nature foiled So oft, and wearied in the vain attempt, Scoffs at her own performance. Reason now Takes part with Appetite, and pleads the cause, Perversely, which of late she so condemn'd; With shallow shifts and old devices, worn And tatter'd in the service of debauch, Covering his shame from his offended sight. “Hath God indeed given appetites to man, And stored the earth so plenteously with means To gratify the hunger of his wish, And doth he reprobate and will he damn The use of his own bounty? making first So frail a kind, and then enacting laws So strict, that less than perfect must despair? Falsehood! which whoso but suspects of truth, Dishonours God, and makes a slave of man. Do they themselves, who undertake for hire The teacher's office, and dispense at large Their weekly dole of edifying strains, Attend to their own music? have they faith In what with such solemnity of tone And gesture they propound to our belief? Nay,—conduct hath the loudest tongue. The voice Is but an instrument on which the priest May play what tune he pleases. In the deed, The unequivocal authentic deed, We find sound argument, we read the heart.” Such reasonings (if that name must needs belong To excuses in which reason has no part,) Serve to compose a spirit well inclined To live on terms of amity with vice, And sin without disturbance. Often urged (As often as libidinous discourse Exhausted, he resorts to solemn themes Of theological and grave import,) They gain at last his unreserved assent; Till harden'd his heart's temper in the forge Of lust, and on the anvil of despair, He slights the strokes of conscience. Nothing moves, Or nothing much, his constancy in ill; Vain tampering has but foster'd his disease, 'Tis desperate, and he sleeps the sleep of death. Haste now, philosopher, and set him free! Charm the deaf serpent wisely. Make him hear Of rectitude and fitness; moral truth How lovely, and the moral sense how sure, Consulted and obeyed, to guide his steps Directly to the first and only fair. Spare not in such a cause. Spend all the powers Of rant and rhapsody in virtue's praise, Be most sublimely good, verbosely grand, And with poetic trappings grace thy prose Till it out-mantle all the pride of verse.— Ah, tinkling cymbal and high-sounding brass Smitten in vain! such music cannot charm The eclipse that intercepts truth's heavenly beam, And chills and darkens a wide-wandering soul. The still small voice is wanted. He must speak Whose word leaps forth at once to its effect, Who calls for things that are not, and they come. Grace makes the slave a freeman. 'Tis a change That turns to ridicule the turgid speech And stately tone of moralists, who boast, As if, like him of fabulous renown, They had indeed ability to smooth The shag of savage nature, and were each An Orpheus and omnipotent in song. But transformation of apostate man From fool to wise, from earthly to divine, Is work for Him that made him. He alone, And He by means in philosophic eyes Trivial and worthy of disdain, achieves The wonder; humanizing what is brute In the lost kind, extracting from the lips Of asps their venom, overpowering strength By weakness, and hostility by love. Patriots have toiled, and in their country's cause Bled nobly, and their deeds, as they deserve, Receive proud recompense. We give in charge Their names to the sweet lyre. The historic Muse, Proud of the treasure, marches with it down To latest times; and Sculpture, in her turn, Gives bond in stone and ever-during brass, To guard them, and to immortalize her trust. But fairer wreaths are due, though never paid, To those who posted at the shrine of truth, Have fallen in her defence. A patriot's blood Well spent in such a strife may earn indeed, And for a time insure to his loved land The sweets of liberty and equal laws; But martyrs struggle for a brighter prize, And win it with more pain. Their blood is shed In confirmation of the noblest claim, Our claim to feed upon immortal truth, To walk with God, to be divinely free, To soar, and to anticipate the skies. Yet few remember them. They lived unknown Till persecution dragg'd them into fame And chased them up to heaven. Their ashes flew —No marble tells us whither. With their names No bard embalms and sanctifies his song; And history, so warm on meaner themes, Is cold on this. She execrates indeed The tyranny that doom'd them to the fire, But gives the glorious sufferers little praise. He is the freeman whom the truth makes free, And all are slaves beside. There's not a chain That hellish foes confederate for his harm Can wind around him, but he casts it off With as much ease as Samson his green withes. He looks abroad into the varied field Of Nature, and though poor perhaps, compared With those whose mansions glitter in his sight, Calls the delightful scenery all his own. His are the mountains, and the valleys his, And the resplendent rivers; his to enjoy With a propriety that none can feel, But who with filial confidence inspired Can lift to heaven an unpresumptuous eye, And smiling say—my Father made them all. Are they not his by a peculiar right, And by an emphasis of interest his, Whose eye they fill with tears of holy joy, Whose heart with praise, and whose exalted mind With worthy thoughts of that unwearied love That plann'd, and built, and still upholds a world So clothed with beauty, for rebellious man? Yes—ye may fill your garners, ye that reap The loaded soil, and ye may waste much good In senseless riot; but ye will not find In feast or in the chase, in song or dance, A liberty like his, who unimpeach'd Of usurpation and to no man's wrong, Appropriates nature as his Father's work, And has a richer use of yours, than ye. He is indeed a freeman: free by birth Of no mean city, plann'd or ere the hills Were built, the fountains open'd, or the sea With all his roaring multitude of waves. His freedom is the same in every state; And no condition of this changeful life So manifold in cares, whose every day Brings its own evil with it, makes it less. For he has wings that neither sickness, pain, Nor penury, can cripple or confine. No nook so narrow but he spreads them there With ease, and is at large. The oppressor holds His body bound, but knows not what a range His spirit takes unconscious of a chain, And that to bind him is a vain attempt Whom God delights in, and in whom he dwells. Acquaint thyself with God if thou wouldst taste His works. Admitted once to his embrace, Thou shalt perceive that thou wast blind before; Thine eye shall be instructed, and thine heart Made pure, shall relish with divine delight Till then unfelt, what hands divine have wrought. Brutes graze the mountain-top with faces prone And eyes intent upon the scanty herb It yields them; or recumbent on its brow, Ruminate heedless of the scene outspread Beneath, beyond, and stretching far away From inland regions to the distant main. Man views it and admires, but rests content With what he views. The landscape has his praise, But not its Author. Unconcern'd who form'd The paradise he sees, he finds it such, And such well-pleased to find it, asks no more. Not so the mind that has been touch'd from heaven, And in the school of sacred wisdom taught To read His wonders, in whose thought the world, Fair as it is, existed ere it was. Not for its own sake merely, but for His Much more who fashioned it, he gives it praise; Praise that from earth resulting as it ought To earth's acknowledged sovereign, finds at once Its only just proprietor in Him. The soul that sees him, or receives sublimed New faculties, or learns at least to employ More worthily the powers she own'd before; Discerns in all things, what with stupid gaze Of ignorance till then she overlook'd, A ray of heavenly light gilding all forms Terrestrial, in the vast and the minute The unambiguous footsteps of the God Who gives its lustre to an insect's wing, And wheels his throne upon the rolling worlds. Much conversant with heaven, she often holds With those fair ministers of light to man That fill the skies nightly with silent pomp, Sweet conference; enquires what strains were they With which heaven rang, when every star, in haste To gratulate the new-created earth, Sent forth a voice, and all the sons of God Shouted for joy.—“Tell me, ye shining hosts That navigate a sea that knows no storms Beneath a vault unsullied with a cloud, If from your elevation, whence ye view Distinctly scenes invisible to man, And systems of whose birth no tidings yet Have reach'd this nether world, ye spy a race Favour'd as ours, transgressors from the womb And hasting to a grave, yet doom'd to rise, And to possess a brighter heaven than yours? As one who long detain'd on foreign shores Pants to return, and when he sees afar His country's weather-bleach'd and batter'd rocks From the green wave emerging, darts an eye Radiant with joy towards the happy land; So I with animated hopes behold And many an aching wish, your beamy fires, That show like beacons in the blue abyss Ordain'd to guide the embodied spirit home From toilsome life to never ending rest. Love kindles as I gaze. I feel desires That give assurance of their own success, And that infused from heaven, must thither tend.” So reads he nature whom the lamp of truth Illuminates. Thy lamp, mysterious Word! Which whoso sees, no longer wanders lost With intellects bemazed in endless doubt, But runs the road of wisdom. Thou hast built, With means that were not till by thee employ'd, Worlds that had never been hadst thou in strength Been less, or less benevolent than strong. They are thy witnesses, who speak thy power And goodness infinite, but speak in ears That hear not, or receive not their report. In vain thy creatures testify of thee Till thou proclaim thyself. Theirs is indeed A teaching voice; but 'tis the praise of thine That whom it teaches it makes prompt to learn, And with the boon gives talents for its use. Till Thou art heard, imaginations vain Possess the heart, and fables false as hell, Yet deem'd oracular, lure down to death The uninform'd and heedless souls of men. We give to Chance, blind Chance, ourselves as blind, The glory of thy work, which yet appears Perfect and unimpeachable of blame, Challenging human scrutiny, and proved Then skilful most when most severely judged. But Chance is not; or is not where thou reign'st: Thy Providence forbids that fickle power (If power she be that works but to confound,) To mix her wild vagaries with thy laws. Yet thus we dote, refusing while we can Instruction, and inventing to ourselves Gods such as guilt makes welcome, Gods that sleep, Or disregard our follies, or that sit Amused spectators of this bustling stage. Thee we reject, unable to abide Thy purity, till pure as thou art pure, Made such by thee, we love thee for that cause For which we shunn'd and hated thee before. Then we are free: then liberty like day Breaks on the soul, and by a flash from heaven Fires all the faculties with glorious joy. A voice is heard that mortal ears hear not Till thou hast touch'd them; 'tis the voice of song, A loud Hosanna sent from all thy works, Which he that hears it with a shout repeats, And adds his rapture to the general praise. In that blest moment, Nature throwing wide Her vale opaque, discloses with a smile The Author of her beauties, who retired Behind his own creation, works unseen By the impure, and hears his power denied. Thou art the source and centre of all minds, Their only point of rest, eternal Word! From thee departing, they are lost and rove At random, without honour, hope, or peace. From thee is all that sooths the life of man, His high endeavour, and his glad success, His strength to suffer, and his will to serve. But oh thou bounteous Giver of all good, Thou art of all thy gifts thyself the crown! Give what thou canst, without thee we are poor, And with thee rich, take what thou wilt away. BOOK VI. THE WINTER WALK AT NOON. ARGUMENT OF THE SIXTH BOOK. Bells at a distance. Their effect. A fine noon in winter. A sheltered walk. Meditation better than books. Our familiarity with the course of nature makes it appear less wonderful than it is. The transformation that spring effects in a shrubbery described. A mistake concerning the course of nature corrected. God maintains it by an unremitted act. The amusements fashionable at this hour of the day reproved. Animals happy, a delightful sight. Origin of cruelty to animals. That it is a great crime proved from Scripture. That proof illustrated by a tale. A line drawn between the lawful and the unlawful destruction of them. Their good and useful properties insisted on. Apology for the encomiums bestowed by the author on animals. Instances of man's extravagant praise of man. The groans of the creation shall have an end. A view taken of the restoration of all things. An Invocation and an Invitation of him who shall bring it to pass. The retired man vindicated from the charge of uselessness. Conclusion. There is in souls a sympathy with sounds, And as the mind is pitch'd the ear is pleased With melting airs or martial, brisk or grave. Some chord in unison with what we hear Is touch'd within us, and the heart replies. How soft the music of those village bells Falling at intervals upon the ear In cadence sweet! now dying all away, Now pealing loud again and louder still, Clear and sonorous as the gale comes on. With easy force it opens all the cells Where memory slept. Wherever I have heard A kindred melody, the scene recurs, And with it all its pleasures and its pains. Such comprehensive views the spirit takes, That in a few short moments I retrace (As in a map the voyager his course,) The windings of my way through many years. Short as in retrospect the journey seems, It seem'd not always short; the rugged path And prospect oft so dreary and forlorn Moved many a sigh at its disheartening length. Yet feeling present evils, while the past Faintly impress the mind, or not at all, How readily we wish time spent revoked, That we might try the ground again, where once (Through inexperience as we now perceive,) We miss'd that happiness we might have found. Some friend is gone, perhaps his son's best friend A father, whose authority, in show When most severe, and mustering all its force, Was but the graver countenance of love; Whose favour, like the clouds of spring, might lower, And utter now and then an aweful voice, But had a blessing in its darkest frown, Threatening at once and nourishing the plant. We loved, but not enough the gentle hand That rear'd us. At a thoughtless age allured By every gilded folly, we renounced His sheltering side, and wilfully forewent That converse which we now in vain regret. How gladly would the man recall to life The boy's neglected sire! a mother too, That softer friend, perhaps more gladly still, Might he demand them at the gates of death. Sorrow has since they went subdued and tamed The playful humour; he could now endure, (Himself grown sober in the vale of tears,) And feel a parent's presence no restraint. But not to understand a treasure's worth Till time has stolen away the slighted good, Is cause of half the poverty we feel, And makes the world the wilderness it is. The few that pray at all pray oft amiss, And seeking grace to improve the prize they hold Would urge a wiser suit, than asking more. The night was winter in his roughest mood, The morning sharp and clear. But now at noon Upon the southern side of the slant hills, And where the woods fence off the northern blast, The season smiles, resigning all its rage, And has the warmth of May. The vault is blue Without a cloud, and white without a speck The dazzling splendour of the scene below. Again the harmony comes o'er the vale, And through the trees I view the embattled tower Whence all the music. I again perceive The soothing influence of the wasted strains, And settle in soft musings as I tread The walk still verdant under oaks and elms, Whose outspread branches overarch the glade. The roof though moveable through all its length As the wind sways it, has yet well sufficed, And intercepting in their silent fall The frequent flakes, has kept a path for me. No noise is here, or none that hinders thought. The redbreast warbles still, but is content With slender notes and more than half suppress'd. Pleased with his solitude, and flitting light From spray to spray, where'er he rests he shakes From many a twig the pendent drops of ice, That tinkle in the wither'd leaves below. Stillness accompanied with sounds so soft Charms more than silence. Meditation here May think down hours to moments. Here the heart May give an useful lesson to the head, And learning wiser grow without his books. Knowledge and wisdom, far from being one, Have ofttimes no connection. Knowledge dwells In heads replete with thoughts of other men, Wisdom in minds attentive to their own. Knowledge, a rude unprofitable mass, The mere materials with which wisdom builds, Till smooth'd and squared and fitted to its place, Does but encumber whom it seems to enrich. Knowledge is proud that he has learn'd so much; Wisdom is humble that he knows no more. Books are not seldom talismans and spells By which the magic art of shrewder wits Holds an unthinking multitude enthrall'd. Some to the fascination of a name Surrender judgement hood-wink'd. Some the style Infatuates, and through labyrinths and wilds Of error, leads them by a tune entranced. While sloth seduces more, too weak to bear The insupportable fatigue of thought, And swallowing therefore without pause or choice The total grist unsifted, husks and all. But trees, and rivulets whose rapid course Defies the check of winter, haunts of deer, And sheep-walks populous with bleating lambs, And lanes in which the primrose ere her time Peeps through the moss that clothes the hawthorn root, Deceive no student. Wisdom there, and truth, Not shy as in the world, and to be won By slow solicitation, seize at once The roving thought, and fix it on themselves. What prodigies can power divine perform More grand, than it produces year by year, And all in sight of inattentive man! Familiar with the effect we slight the cause, And in the constancy of nature's course, The regular return of genial months, And renovation of a faded world, See nought to wonder at. Should God again, As once in Gibeon, interrupt the race Of the undeviating and punctual sun, How would the world admire! But speaks it less An agency divine, to make him know His moment when to sink and when to rise Age after age, than to arrest his course? All we behold is miracle, but seen So duly, all is miracle in vain. Where now the vital energy that moved, While summer was, the pure and subtle lymph Through the imperceptible mæandering veins Of leaf and flower? It sleeps; and the icy touch Of unprolific winter has impress'd A cold stagnation on the intestine tide. But let the months go round, a few short months, And all shall be restored. These naked shoots, Barren as lances, among which the wind Makes wintry music, sighing as it goes, Shall put their graceful foliage on again, And more aspiring and with ampler spread Shall boast new charms, and more than they have lost. Then, each in its peculiar honours clad, Shall publish even to the distant eye Its family and tribe. Laburnum rich In streaming gold; syringa ivory pure; The scented and the scentless rose; this red And of an humbler growth, the other tall, And throwing up into the darkest gloom Of neighbouring cypress or more sable yew Her silver globes, light as the foamy surf That the wind severs from the broken wave. The lilac various in array, now white, Now sanguine, and her beauteous head now set With purple spikes pyramidal, as if Studious of ornament, yet unresolved Which hue she most approved, she chose them all. Copious of flowers the woodbine, pale and wan, But well compensating their sickly looks With never-cloying odours, early and late. Hypericum all bloom, so thick a swarm Of flowers like flies clothing her slender rods That scarce a leaf appears. Mezerion too, Though leafless, well attired, and thick beset With blushing wreaths investing every spray. Althæa with the purple eye; the broom, Yellow and bright as bullion unalloy'd Her blossoms; and luxuriant above all The jasmine, throwing wide her elegant sweets, The deep dark green of whose unvarnish'd leaf Makes more conspicuous, and illumines more The bright profusion of her scatter'd stars. These have been, and these shall be in their day; And all this uniform uncoloured scene Shall be dismantled of its fleecy load, And flush into variety again. From dearth to plenty, and from death to life, Is Nature's progress when she lectures man In heavenly truth; evincing as she makes The grand transition, that there lives and works A soul in all things, and that soul is God. The beauties of the wilderness are his, That make so gay the solitary place Where no eye sees them. And the fairer forms That cultivation glories in, are his. He sets the bright procession on its way, And marshals all the order of the year. He marks the bounds which winter may not pass, And blunts his pointed fury. In its case Russet and rude, folds up the tender germ Uninjured, with inimitable art, And ere one flowery season fades and dies Designs the blooming wonders of the next. Some say that in the origin of things, When all creation started into birth, The infant elements received a law From which they swerve not since. That under force Of that controling ordinance they move, And need not his immediate hand, who first Prescribed their course, to regulate it now. Thus dream they, and contrive to save a God The encumbrance of his own concerns, and spare The great Artificer of all that moves The stress of a continual act, the pain Of unremitted vigilance and care, As too laborious and severe a task. So man the moth, is not afraid it seems To span Omnipotence, and measure might That knows no measure, by the scanty rule And standard of his own, that is to-day, And is not ere to-morrow's sun go down. But how should matter occupy a charge Dull as it is, and satisfy a law So vast in its demands, unless impell'd To ceaseless service by a ceaseless force, And under pressure of some conscious cause? The Lord of all, himself through all diffused, Sustains and is the life of all that lives. Nature is but a name for an effect Whose cause is God. He feeds the secret fire By which the mighty process is maintain'd, Who sleeps not, is not weary; in whose sight Slow-circling ages are as transient days; Whose work is without labour, whose designs No flaw deforms, no difficulty thwarts, And whose beneficence no charge exhausts. Him blind antiquity profaned, not served, With self-taught rites and under various names, Female and male, Pomona, Pales, Pan, And Flora and Vertumnus; peopling earth With tutelary goddesses and gods That were not, and commending as they would To each some province, garden, field, or grove. But all are under One. One spirit—His Who bore the platted thorns with bleeding brows, Rules universal nature. Not a flower But shows some touch in freckle, streak or stain, Of his unrivall'd pencil. He inspires Their balmy odours and imparts their hues, And bathes their eyes with nectar, and includes In grains as countless as the sea-side sands, The forms with which he sprinkles all the earth. Happy who walks with him! whom what he finds Of flavour or of scent in fruit or flower, Or what he views of beautiful or grand In Nature, from the broad majestic oak To the green blade that twinkles in the sun, Prompts with remembrance of a present God. His presence who made all so fair, perceived, Makes all still fairer. As with him no scene Is dreary, so with him all seasons please. Though winter had been none had man been true, And earth be punished for its tenant's sake, Yet not in vengeance; as this smiling sky So soon succeeding such an angry night, And these dissolving snows, and this clear stream Recovering fast its liquid music, prove. Who then that has a mind well strung and tuned To contemplation, and within his reach A scene so friendly to his favourite task, Would waste attention at the chequer'd board, His host of wooden warriors to and fro Marching and counter-marching, with an eye As fixt as marble, with a forehead ridged And furrow'd into storms, and with a hand Trembling, as if eternity were hung In balance on his conduct of a pin? Nor envies he aught more their idle sport Who pant with application misapplied To trivial toys, and pushing ivory balls Across the velvet level, feel a joy Akin to rapture, when the bauble finds Its destined goal of difficult access. Nor deems he wiser him, who gives his noon To Miss, the Mercer's plague, from shop to shop Wandering, and littering with unfolded silks The polished counter, and approving none, Or promising with smiles to call again. Nor him, who by his vanity seduced And soothed into a dream that he discerns The difference of a Guido from a daub, Frequents the crowded auction. Station'd there As duly as the Langford of the show, With glass at eye, and catalogue in hand, And tongue accomplished in the fulsome cant And pedantry that coxcombs learn with ease, Oft as the price-deciding hammer falls He notes it in his book, then raps his box, Swears 'tis a bargain, rails at his hard fate That he has let it pass,—but never bids. Here unmolested, through whatever sign The sun proceeds, I wander. Neither mist, Nor freezing sky, nor sultry, checking me, Nor stranger intermeddling with my joy. Even in the spring and play-time of the year That calls the unwonted villager abroad With all her little ones, a sportive train, To gather king-cups in the yellow mead, And prink their hair with daisies, or to pick A cheap but wholesome sallad from the brook, These shades are all my own. The timorous hare, Grown so familiar with her frequent guest, Scarce shuns me; and the stock-dove unalarm'd Sits cooing in the pine-tree, nor suspends His long love-ditty for my near approach. Drawn from his refuge in some lonely elm That age or injury has hollow'd deep, Where on his bed of wool and matted leaves He has outslept the winter, ventures forth To frisk a while, and bask in the warm sun, The squirrel, flippant, pert, and full of play. He sees me, and at once, swift as a bird, Ascends the neighbouring beech; there whisks his brush And perks his ears, and stamps and scolds aloud, With all the prettiness of feign'd alarm, And anger insignificantly fierce. The heart is hard in nature, and unfit For human fellowship, as being void Of sympathy, and therefore dead alike To love and friendship both, that is not pleased With sight of animals enjoying life, Nor feels their happiness augment his own. The bounding fawn that darts across the glade When none pursues, through mere delight of heart, And spirits buoyant with excess of glee; The horse, as wanton and almost as fleet, That skims the spacious meadow at full speed, Then stops and snorts, and throwing high his heels Starts to the voluntary race again; The very kine that gambol at high noon, The total herd receiving first from one That leads the dance, a summons to be gay, Though wild their strange vagaries, and uncouth Their efforts, yet resolved with one consent To give such act and utterance as they may To ecstasy too big to be suppressed;— These, and a thousand images of bliss, With which kind nature graces every scene Where cruel man defeats not her design, Impart to the benevolent, who wish All that are capable of pleasure pleased, A far superior happiness to theirs, The comfort of a reasonable joy. Man scarce had risen, obedient to His call Who form'd him, from the dust his future grave, When he was crown'd as never king was since. God set the diadem upon his head, And angel choirs attended. Wondering stood The new-made monarch, while before him pass'd, All happy and all perfect in their kind, The creatures, summon'd from their various haunts To see their sovereign, and confess his sway. Vast was his empire, absolute his power, Or bounded only by a law whose force 'Twas his sublimest privilege to feel And own, the law of universal love. He ruled with meekness, they obeyed with joy. No cruel purpose lurk'd within his heart, And no distrust of his intent in theirs. So Eden was a scene of harmless sport, Where kindness on his part who ruled the whole Begat a tranquil confidence in all, And fear as yet was not, nor cause for fear. But sin marr'd all; and the revolt of man, That source of evils not exhausted yet, Was punish'd with revolt of his from him. Garden of God, how terrible the change Thy groves and lawns then witness'd! every heart, Each animal of every name, conceived A jealousy and an instinctive fear, And conscious of some danger, either fled Precipitate the loathed abode of man, Or growl'd defiance in such angry sort, As taught him too to tremble in his turn. Thus harmony and family accord Were driven from Paradise; and in that hour The seeds of cruelty that since have swell'd To such gigantic and enormous growth, Were sown in human nature's fruitful soil. Hence date the persecution and the pain That man inflicts on all inferior kinds, Regardless of their plaints. To make him sport, To gratify the frenzy of his wrath, Or his base gluttony, are causes good And just in his account, why bird and beast Should suffer torture, and the streams be dyed With blood of their inhabitants impaled. Earth groans beneath the burthen of a war Waged with defenceless innocence, while he, Not satisfied to prey on all around, Adds tenfold bitterness to death, by pangs Needless, and first torments ere he devours. Now happiest they that occupy the scenes The most remote from his abhorr'd resort, Whom once as delegate of God on earth They fear'd, and as his perfect image loved. The wilderness is theirs with all its caves, Its hollow glens, its thickets, and its plains Unvisited by man. There they are free, And howl and roar as likes them, uncontrol'd, Nor ask his leave to slumber or to play. Woe to the tyrant if he dare intrude Within the confines of their wild domain; The Lion tells him—I am monarch here,— And if he spares him, spares him on the terms Of royal mercy, and through generous scorn To rend a victim trembling at his foot. In measure as by force of instinct drawn, Or by necessity constrain'd, they live Dependent upon man, those in his fields, These at his crib, and some beneath his roof; They prove too often at how dear a rate He sells protection. Witness, at his foot The spaniel dying for some venial fault, Under dissection of the knotted scourge. Witness the patient ox, with stripes and yells Driven to the slaughter, goaded as he runs To madness, while the savage at his heels Laughs at the frantic sufferer's fury spent Upon the guiltless passenger o'erthrown. He too is witness, noblest of the train That wait on man, the flight-performing horse: With unsuspecting readiness he takes His murtherer on his back, and push'd all day With bleeding sides and flanks that heave for life To the far-distant goal, arrives and dies. So little mercy shows who needs so much! Does law, so jealous in the cause of man, Denounce no doom on the delinquent? None. He lives, and o'er his brimming beaker boasts (As if barbarity were high desert,) The inglorious feat, and clamorous in praise Of the poor brute, seems wisely to suppose The honours of his matchless horse his own. But many a crime deem'd innocent on earth Is register'd in heaven, and these, no doubt, Have each their record, with a curse annex'd. Man may dismiss compassion from his heart, But God will never. When he charged the Jew To assist his foe's down-fallen beast to rise, And when the bush-exploring boy that seized The young, to let the parent bird go free, Proved he not plainly that his meaner works Are yet his care, and have an interest all, All, in the universal Father's love? On Noah, and in him on all mankind The charter was conferr'd by which we hold The flesh of animals in fee, and claim O'er all we feed on, power of life and death. But read the instrument, and mark it well. The oppression of a tyrannous controul Can find no warrant there. Feed then, and yield Thanks for thy food. Carnivorous through sin Feed on the slain, but spare the living brute. The Governor of all, himself to all So bountiful, in whose attentive ear The unfledged raven and the lion's whelp Plead not in vain for pity on the pangs Of hunger unassuaged, has interposed, Not seldom, his avenging arm, to smite The injurious trampler upon nature's law That claims forbearance even for a brute. He hates the hardness of a Balaam's heart; And prophet as he was, he might not strike The blameless animal, without rebuke, On which he rode: her opportune offence Saved him, or the unrelenting seer had died. He sees that human equity is slack To interfere, though in so just a cause And makes the task his own; inspiring dumb And helpless victims with a sense so keen Of injury, with such knowledge of their strength, And such sagacity to take revenge, That oft the beast has seem'd to judge the man. An ancient, not a legendary tale, By one of sound intelligence rehearsed, (If such, who plead for Providence, may seem In modern eyes,) shall make the doctrine clear. Where England stretch'd towards the setting sun Narrow and long, o'erlooks the western wave, Dwelt young Misagathus; a scorner he Of God and goodness, atheist in ostent, Vicious in act, in temper savage-fierce. He journey'd, and his chance was as he went, To join a traveller of far different note, Evander, famed for piety, for years Deserving honour, but for wisdom more. Fame had not left the venerable man A stranger to the manners of the youth, Whose face too was familiar to his view. Their way was on the margin of the land, O'er the green summit of the rocks whose base Beats back the roaring surge, scarce heard so high. The charity that warm'd his heart was moved At sight of the man-monster. With a smile Gentle, and affable, and full of grace, As fearful of offending whom he wish'd Much to persuade, he plied his ear with truths Not harshly thunder'd forth or rudely press'd, But like his purpose, gracious, kind, and sweet. And dost thou dream, the impenetrable man Exclaim'd, that me, the lullabies of age And fantasies of dotards such as thou Can cheat, or move a moment's fear in me? Mark now the proof I give thee, that the brave Need no such aids as superstition lends To steel their hearts against the dread of death! He spoke, and to the precipice at hand Push'd with a madman's fury. Fancy shrinks And the blood thrills and curdles at the thought Of such a gulf as he design'd his grave. But though the felon on his back could dare The dreadful leap, more rational his steed Declined the death, and wheeling swiftly round Or ere his hoof had press'd the crumbling verge, Baffled his rider, saved against his will. The frenzy of the brain may be redress'd By medicine well applied, but without grace The heart's insanity admits no cure. Enraged the more by what might have reform'd His horrible intent, again he sought Destruction with a zeal to be destroyed, With sounding whip and rowels dyed in blood. But still in vain. The providence that meant A longer date to the far nobler beast, Spared yet again the ignobler for his sake. And now, his prowess proved, and his sincere Incurable obduracy evinced, His rage grew cool; and pleased perhaps to have earn'd So cheaply the renown of that attempt, With looks of some complacence he resumed His road, deriding much the blank amaze Of good Evander, still where he was left Fixt motionless, and petrified with dread. So on they fared; discourse on other themes Ensuing, seem'd to obliterate the past, And tamer far for so much fury shown, (As is the course of rash and fiery men,) The rude companion smiled as if transform'd. But 'twas a transient calm. A storm was near, An unsuspected storm. His hour was come. The impious challenger of power divine Was now to learn, that Heaven though slow to wrath, Is never with impunity defied. His horse, as he had caught his master's mood, Snorting, and starting into sudden rage, Unbidden, and not now to be controul'd, Rush'd to the cliff, and having reach'd it, stood. At once the shock unseated him. He flew Sheer o'er the craggy barrier, and immersed Deep in the flood, found, when he sought it not, The death he had deserved, and died alone. So God wrought double justice; made the fool The victim of his own tremendous choice, And taught a brute the way to safe revenge. I would not enter on my list of friends (Though graced with polish'd manners and fine sense Yet wanting sensibility,) the man Who needlessly sets foot upon a worm. An inadvertent step may crush the snail That crawls at evening in the public path, But he that has humanity, forewarned, Will tread aside, and let the reptile live. The creeping vermin, loathsome to the sight, And charged perhaps with venom, that intrudes A visitor unwelcome into scenes Sacred to neatness and repose, the alcove, The chamber, or refectory, may die. A necessary act incurs no blame. Not so when held within their proper bounds And guiltless of offence, they range the air, Or take their pastime in the spacious field. There they are privileged; and he that hunts Or harms them there, is guilty of a wrong, Disturbs the economy of nature's realm, Who when she form'd, design'd them an abode. The sum is this: if man's convenience, health, Or safety interfere, his rights and claims Are paramount, and must extinguish theirs. Else they are all—the meanest things that are, As free to live and to enjoy that life, As God was free to form them at the first, Who in his sovereign wisdom made them all. Ye therefore who love mercy, teach your sons To love it too. The spring-time of our years Is soon dishonour'd and defiled in most By budding ills, that ask a prudent hand To check them. But alas! none sooner shoots, If unrestrain'd, into luxuriant growth, Than cruelty, most devilish of them all. Mercy to him that shows it, is the rule And righteous limitation of its act By which Heaven moves in pardoning guilty man; And he that shows none, being ripe in years, And conscious of the outrage he commits, Shall seek it, and not find it in his turn. Distinguish'd much by reason, and still more By our capacity of grace divine, From creatures that exist but for our sake, Which having served us, perish, we are held Accountable, and God, some future day, Will reckon with us roundly for the abuse Of what he deems no mean or trivial trust. Superior as we are, they yet depend Not more on human help, than we on theirs. Their strength, or speed, or vigilance, were given In aid of our defects. In some are found Such teachable and apprehensive parts, That man's attainments in his own concerns, Match'd with the expertness of the brutes in theirs, Are oft-times vanquish'd and thrown far behind. Some show that nice sagacity of smell, And read with such discernment in the port And figure of the man, his secret aim, That oft we owe our safety to a skill We could not teach, and must despair to learn. But learn we might, if not too proud to stoop To quadrupede instructors, many a good And useful quality, and virtue too, Rarely exemplified among ourselves; Attachment never to be wean'd, or changed By any change of fortune, proof alike Against unkindness, absence, and neglect; Fidelity, that neither bribe nor threat Can move or warp, and gratitude for small And trivial favours, lasting as the life, And glistening even in the dying eye. Man praises man. Desert in arts or arms Wins public honour; and ten thousand sit Patiently present at a sacred song, Commemoration-mad; content to hear (Oh wonderful effect of music's power!) Messiah's eulogy, for Handel's sake. But less, methinks, than sacrilege might serve— (For was it less? What heathen would have dared To strip Jove's statue of his oaken wreath And hang it up in honour of a man?) Much less might serve, when all that we design Is but to gratify an itching ear, And give the day to a musician's praise. Remember Handel? who that was not born Deaf as the dead to harmony, forgets, Or can, the more than Homer of his age? Yes—we remember him. And while we praise A talent so divine, remember too That His most holy book from whom it came Was never meant, was never used before To buckram out the memory of a man. But hush!—the muse perhaps is too severe, And with a gravity beyond the size And measure of the offence, rebukes a deed Less impious than absurd, and owing more To want of judgement than to wrong design. So in the chapel of old Ely House, When wandering Charles, who meant to be the third, Had fled from William, and the news was fresh, The simple clerk but loyal, did announce, And eke did rear right merrily, two staves, Sung to the praise and glory of King George. —Man praises man, and Garrick's memory next, When time hath somewhat mellow'd it, and made The idol of our worship while he lived, The God of our idolatry once more, Shall have its altar; and the world shall go In pilgrimage to bow before his shrine. The theatre too small, shall suffocate Its squeezed contents, and more than it admits Shall sigh at their exclusion, and return Ungratified. For there some noble lord Shall stuff his shoulders with King Richard's bunch, Or wrap himself in Hamlet's inky cloak, And strut and storm and straddle, stamp and stare, To show the world how Garrick did not act. For Garrick was a worshipper himself; He drew the Liturgy, and framed the rites And solemn ceremonial of the day, And call'd the world to worship on the banks Of Avon famed in song. Ah! pleasant proof That piety has still in human hearts Some place, a spark or two not yet extinct. The mulberry tree was hung with blooming wreaths, The mulberry tree stood centre of the dance, The mulberry tree was hymn'd with dulcet airs, And from his touchwood trunk the mulberry tree Supplied such relics as devotion holds Still sacred, and preserves with pious care. So 'twas an hallow'd time. Decorum reign'd, And mirth without offence. No few return'd Doubtless much edified, and all refreshed. —Man praises man. The rabble all alive, From tippling-benches, cellars, stalls, and styes, Swarm in the streets. The statesman of the day, A pompous and slow-moving pageant comes. Some shout him, and some hang upon his car To gaze in his eyes and bless him. Maidens wave Their 'kerchiefs, and old women weep for joy; While others not so satisfied unhorse The gilded equipage, and turning loose His steeds, usurp a place they well deserve. Why? what has charm'd them? Hath he saved the state? No. Doth he purpose its salvation? No. Enchanting novelty, that moon at full, That finds out every crevice of the head That is not sound and perfect, hath in theirs Wrought this disturbance. But the wane is near, And his own cattle must suffice him soon. Thus idly do we waste the breath of praise, And dedicate a tribute, in its use And just direction sacred, to a thing Doom'd to the dust, or lodged already there. Encomium in old time was poets' work; But poets having lavishly long since Exhausted all materials of the art, The task now falls into the public hand. And I, contented with an humble theme, Have poured my stream of panegyric down The vale of nature, where it creeps and winds Among her lovely works, with a secure And unambitious course, reflecting clear If not the virtues yet the worth of brutes. And I am recompensed, and deem the toils Of poetry not lost, if verse of mine May stand between an animal and woe, And teach one tyrant pity for his drudge. The groans of nature in this nether world, Which Heaven has heard for ages, have an end. Foretold by prophets, and by poets sung Whose fire was kindled at the prophets' lamp, The time of rest, the promised sabbath comes. Six thousand years of sorrow have well nigh Fulfill'd their tardy and disastrous course Over a sinful world. And what remains Of this tempestuous state of human things, Is merely as the working of a sea Before a calm, that rocks itself to rest. For He whose car the winds are, and the clouds The dust that waits upon his sultry march When sin hath moved him and his wrath is hot, Shall visit earth in mercy; shall descend Propitious, in his chariot paved with love, And what his storms have blasted and defaced For man's revolt, shall with a smile repair. Sweet is the harp of prophecy: too sweet Not to be wrong'd by a mere mortal touch; Nor can the wonders it records be sung To meaner music, and not suffer loss. But when a poet, or when one like me, Happy to rove among poetic flowers, Though poor in skill to rear them, lights at last On some fair theme, some theme divinely fair, Such is the impulse and the spur he feels To give it praise proportioned to its worth, That not to attempt it, arduous as he deems The labour, were a task more arduous still. Oh scenes surpassing fable, and yet true, Scenes of accomplish'd bliss! which who can see Though but in distant prospect, and not feel His soul refresh'd with foretaste of the joy? Rivers of gladness water all the earth, And clothe all climes with beauty; the reproach Of barrenness is past. The fruitful field Laughs with abundance; and the land once lean, Or fertile only in its own disgrace, Exults to see its thistly curse repealed. The various seasons woven into one, And that one season an eternal spring, The garden fears no blight, and needs no fence, For there is none to covet, all are full. The lion and the libbard and the bear Graze with the fearless flocks. All bask at noon Together, or all gambol in the shade Of the same grove, and drink one common stream. Antipathies are none. No foe to man Lurks in the serpent now; the mother sees And smiles to see her infant's playful hand Stretch'd forth to dally with the crested worm, To stroke his azure neck, or to receive The lambent homage of his arrowy tongue. All creatures worship man, and all mankind One Lord, one Father. Error has no place; That creeping pestilence is driven away, The breath of heaven has chased it. In the heart No passion touches a discordant string, But all is harmony and love. Disease Is not. The pure and uncontaminate blood Holds its due course, nor fears the frost of age. One song employs all nations, and all cry “Worthy the Lamb, for he was slain for us!” The dwellers in the vales and on the rocks Shout to each other; and the mountain tops From distant mountains catch the flying joy, Till nation after nation taught the strain, Each rolls the rapturous Hosanna round. Behold the measure of the promise fill'd, See Salem built, the labour of a God! Bright as a sun the sacred city shines; All kingdoms and all princes of the earth Flock to that light; the glory of all lands Flows into her, unbounded is her joy, And endless her increase. Thy rams are there Nebaioth, and the flocks of Kedar Nebaioth and Kedar, the sons of Ishmael and progenitors of the Arabs, in the prophetic scripture here alluded to, may be reasonably considered as representatives of the Gentiles at large. C.there; The looms of Ormus, and the mines of Ind, And Saba's spicy groves pay tribute there. Praise is in all her gates. Upon her walls, And in her streets, and in her spacious courts Is heard salvation. Eastern Java there Kneels with the native of the farthest West, And Æthiopia spreads abroad the hand And worships. Her report has travell'd forth Into all lands. From every clime they come To see thy beauty, and to share thy joy O Sion! an assembly such as earth Saw never, such as heaven stoops down to see. Thus heavenward all things tend. For all were once Perfect, and all must be at length restored. So God has greatly purposed; who would else In his dishonoured works himself endure Dishonour, and be wrong'd without redress. Haste then, and wheel away a shatter'd world, Ye slow-revolving seasons! We would see (A sight to which our eyes are strangers yet,) A world that does not dread and hate his laws, And suffer for its crime: would learn how fair The creature is that God pronounces good, How pleasant in itself what pleases him. Here every drop of honey hides a sting; Worms wind themselves into our sweetest flowers, And even the joy that haply some poor heart Derives from heaven, pure as the fountain is, Is sullied in the stream; taking a taint From touch of human lips, at best impure. Oh for a world in principle as chaste As this is gross and selfish! over which Custom and prejudice shall bear no sway That govern all things here, shouldering aside The meek and modest truth, and forcing her To seek a refuge from the tongue of strife In nooks obscure, far from the ways of men. Where violence shall never lift the sword, Nor cunning justify the proud man's wrong, Leaving the poor no remedy but tears. Where he that fills an office, shall esteem The occasion it presents of doing good More than the perquisite: where law shall speak Seldom, and never but as wisdom prompts And equity; not jealous more to guard A worthless form, than to decide aright: Where fashion shall not sanctify abuse, Nor smooth good-breeding (supplemental grace,) With lean performance ape the work of love. Come then, and added to thy many crowns Receive yet one, the crown of all the earth, Thou who alone art worthy! it was thine By ancient covenant ere nature's birth, And thou hast made it thine by purchase since, And overpaid its value with thy blood. Thy saints proclaim thee King; and in their hearts Thy title is engraven with a pen Dipt in the fountain of eternal love. Thy saints proclaim thee King; and thy delay Gives courage to their foes, who, could they see The dawn of thy last advent long-desired, Would creep into the bowels of the hills, And flee for safety to the falling rocks. The very spirit of the world is tired Of its own taunting question ask'd so long, “Where is the promise of your Lord's approach?” The infidel has shot his bolts away, Till his exhausted quiver yielding none, He gleans the blunted shafts that have recoiled, And aims them at the shield of truth again. The veil is rent, rent too by priestly hands, That hides divinity from mortal eyes, And all the mysteries to faith proposed Insulted and traduced, are cast aside As useless, to the moles and to the bats. They now are deem'd the faithful, and are praised, Who constant only in rejecting thee, Deny thy Godhead with a martyr's zeal, And quit their office for their error's sake. Blind and in love with darkness! yet even these Worthy, compared with sycophants, who knee Thy name, adoring, and then preach thee man. So fares thy church. But how thy church may fare The world takes little thought; who will may preach, And what they will. All pastors are alike To wandering sheep, resolved to follow none. Two gods divide them all, Pleasure and Gain. For these they live, they sacrifice to these, And in their service wage perpetual war With conscience and with thee. Lust in their hearts, And mischief in their hands, they roam the earth To prey upon each other; stubborn, fierce, High-minded, foaming out their own disgrace. Thy prophets speak of such; and noting down The features of the last degenerate times, Exhibit every lineament of these. Come then, and added to thy many crowns Receive yet one, as radiant as the rest, Due to thy last and most effectual work, Thy word fulfilled, the conquest of a world! He is the happy man, whose life even now Shows somewhat of that happier life to come; Who doomed to an obscure but tranquil state Is pleased with it, and were he free to choose, Would make his fate his choice; whom peace, the fruit Of virtue, and whom virtue, fruit of faith, Prepare for happiness; bespeak him one Content indeed to sojourn while he must Below the skies, but having there his home. The world o'erlooks him in her busy search Of objects more illustrious in her view; And occupied as earnestly as she, Though more sublimely, he o'erlooks the world. She scorns his pleasures, for she knows them not; He seeks not hers, for he has proved them vain. He cannot skim the ground like summer birds Pursuing gilded flies, and such he deems Her honours, her emoluments, her joys. Therefore in contemplation is his bliss, Whose power is such, that whom she lifts from earth She makes familiar with a heaven unseen, And shows him glories yet to be reveal'd. Not slothful he, though seeming unemployed, And censured oft as useless. Stillest streams Oft water fairest meadows, and the bird That flutters least is longest on the wing. Ask him indeed what trophies he has raised, Or what achievements of immortal fame He purposes, and he shall answer—none. His warfare is within. There unfatigued His fervent spirit labours. There he fights, And there obtains fresh triumphs o'er himself, And never-withering wreaths, compared with which The laurels that a Cæsar reaps are weeds. Perhaps the self-approving haughty world, (That as she sweeps him with her whistling silks Scarce deigns to notice him, or if she see Deems him a cipher in the works of God,) Receives advantage from his noiseless hours Of which she little dreams. Perhaps she owes Her sunshine and her rain, her blooming spring And plenteous harvest, to the prayer he makes, When Isaac like, the solitary saint Walks forth to meditate at eventide, And think on her, who thinks not for herself. Forgive him then, thou bustler in concerns Of little worth, and idler in the best, If author of no mischief and some good, He seek his proper happiness by means That may advance, but cannot hinder thine. Nor though he tread the secret path of life, Engage no notice, and enjoy much ease, Account him an incumbrance on the state, Receiving benefits, and rendering none. His sphere though humble, if that humble sphere Shine with his fair example, and though small His influence, if that influence all be spent In soothing sorrow and in quenching strife, In aiding helpless indigence, in works From which at least a grateful few derive Some taste of comfort in a world of woe, Then let the supercilious great confess He serves his country; recompenses well The state beneath the shadow of whose vine He sits secure, and in the scale of life Holds no ignoble, though a slighted place. The man whose virtues are more felt than seen, Must drop indeed the hope of public praise; But he may boast what few that win it can, That if his country stand not by his skill, At least his follies have not wrought her fall. Polite refinement offers him in vain Her golden tube, through which a sensual world Draws gross impurity, and likes it well, The neat conveyance hiding all the offence. Not that he peevishly rejects a mode Because that world adopts it: if it bear The stamp and clear impression of good sense, And be not costly more than of true worth, He puts it on, and for decorum sake Can wear it even as gracefully as she. She judges of refinement by the eye, He by the test of conscience, and a heart Not soon deceived; aware that what is base No polish can make sterling, and that vice Though well perfumed and elegantly dress'd, Like an unburied carcase trick'd with flowers, Is but a garnish'd nuisance, fitter far For cleanly riddance than for fair attire. So life glides smoothly and by stealth away, More golden than that age of fabled gold Renown'd in ancient song; not vex'd with care Or stained with guilt, beneficent, approved Of God and man, and peaceful in its end. So glide my life away! and so at last My share of duties decently fulfilled, May some disease, not tardy to perform Its destined office, yet with gentle stroke, Dismiss me weary to a safe retreat Beneath the turf that I have often trod. It shall not grieve me, then, that once when called To dress a Sofa with the flowers of verse, I play'd awhile, obedient to the fair, With that light task; but soon to please her more Whom flowers alone I knew would little please, Let fall the unfinish'd wreath, and roved for fruit. Roved far and gather'd much. Some harsh, 'tis true, Pick'd from the thorns and briers of reproof, But wholesome, well-digested. Grateful some To palates that can taste immortal truth, Insipid else, and sure to be despised. But all is in His hand whose praise I seek. In vain the poet sings, and the world hears, If he regard not, though divine the theme. 'Tis not in artful measures, in the chime And idle tinkling of a minstrel's lyre To charm His ear, whose eye is on the heart, Whose frown can disappoint the proudest strain, Whose approbation—prosper even mine. AN EPISTLE TO JOSEPH HILL, ESQ. Dear Joseph,—five and twenty years ago— Alas! how time escapes—'tis even so!— With frequent intercourse and always sweet And always friendly we were wont to cheat A tedious hour,—and now we never meet. As some grave gentleman in Terence says, ('Twas therefore much the same in ancient days,) Good lack, we know not what to-morrow brings,— Strange fluctuation of all human things! True. Changes will befall, and friends may part, But distance only cannot change the heart: And were I call'd to prove the assertion true, One proof should serve, a reference to you. Whence comes it then, that in the wane of life, Though nothing have occurr'd to kindle strife, We find the friends we fancied we had won, Though numerous once, reduced to few or none? Can gold grow worthless that has stood the touch? No. Gold they seemed, but they were never such. Horatio's servant once, with bow and cringe Swinging the parlour door upon its hinge, Dreading a negative, and overawed Lest he should trespass, begg'd to go abroad. Go, fellow!—whither?—turning short about— Nay. Stay at home;—you're always going out. 'Tis but a step, sir, just at the street's end.— For what?—An please you, sir, to see a friend. A friend? Horatio cried, and seem'd to start,— Yea marry shalt thou, and with all my heart— And fetch my cloak, for though the night be raw I'll see him too—the first I ever saw. I knew the man, and knew his nature mild, And was his plaything often when a child; But somewhat at that moment pinch'd him close, Else he was seldom bitter or morose: Perhaps his confidence just then betray'd, His grief might prompt him with the speech he made; Perhaps 'twas mere good humour gave it birth, The harmless play of pleasantry and mirth. Howe'er it was, his language in my mind Bespoke at least a man that knew mankind. But not to moralize too much, and strain To prove an evil of which all complain, (I hate long arguments, verbosely spun,) One story more, dear Hill, and I have done. Once on a time, an Emperor, a wise man, No matter where, in China or Japan, Decreed that whosoever should offend Against the well-known duties of a friend, Convicted once, should ever after wear But half a coat, and show his bosom bare; The punishment importing this, no doubt, That all was naught within, and all found out. Oh happy Britain! we have not to fear Such hard and arbitrary measure here; Else could a law like that which I relate, Once have the sanction of our triple state, Some few that I have known in days of old Would run most dreadful risk of catching cold. While you, my friend, whatever wind should blow, Might traverse England safely to and fro, An honest man, close-button'd to the chin, Broad-cloth without, and a warm heart within. TIROCINIUM: OR, A REVIEW OF SCHOOLS. ????????? ?? ???????? ???? ?????. Plato. ???? ????????? ??????, ???? ?????. Diog. Laert. TO THE REV. WILLIAM CAWTHORNE UNWIN, RECTOR OF STOCK IN ESSEX, THE TUTOR OF HIS TWO SONS, THE FOLLOWING Poem, RECOMMENDING PRIVATE TUITION IN PREFERENCE TO AN EDUCATION AT SCHOOL, IS INSCRIBED, BY HIS AFFECTIONATE FRIEND, WILLIAM COWPER. Olney, Nov. 6, 1784. It is not from his form in which we trace Strength joined with beauty, dignity with grace, That man, the master of this globe, derives His right of empire over all that lives. That form indeed, the associate of a mind Vast in its powers, ethereal in its kind, That form, the labour of Almighty skill, Framed for the service of a free-born will, Asserts precedence, and bespeaks controul, But borrows all its grandeur from the soul. Hers is the state, the splendour and the throne, An intellectual kingdom, all her own. For her, the memory fills her ample page With truths pour'd down from every distant age, For her amasses an unbounded store, The wisdom of great nations, now no more, Though laden, not encumber'd with her spoil, Laborious, yet unconscious of her toil, When copiously supplied then most enlarged, Still to be fed, and not to be surcharged. For her, the fancy roving unconfined, The present Muse of every pensive mind, Works magic wonders, adds a brighter hue To nature's scenes, than nature ever knew; At her command, winds rise and waters roar, Again she lays them slumbering on the shore; With flower and fruit the wilderness supplies, Or bids the rocks in ruder pomp arise. For her, the judgment, umpire in the strife, That grace and nature have to wage through life, Quick-sighted arbiter of good and ill, Appointed sage preceptor to the will, Condemns, approves, and with a faithful voice Guides the decision of a doubtful choice. Why did the fiat of a God give birth To yon fair sun and his attendant earth, And when descending he resigns the skies, Why takes the gentler moon her turn to rise, Whom ocean feels through all his countless waves, And owns her power on every shore he laves? Why do the seasons still enrich the year, Fruitful and young as in their first career? Spring hangs her infant blossoms on the trees, Rock'd in the cradle of the western breeze; Summer in haste the thriving charge receives Beneath the shade of her expanded leaves, Till autumn's fiercer heats and plenteous dews Dye them at last in all their glowing hues;— 'Twere wild profusion all, and bootless waste, Power misemployed, munificence misplaced, Had not its Author dignified the plan, And crowned it with the majesty of man. Thus form'd, thus placed, intelligent, and taught, Look where he will, the wonders God has wrought, The wildest scorner of his Maker's laws Finds in a sober moment time to pause, To press the important question on his heart, “Why form'd at all, and wherefore as thou art?” If man be what he seems, this hour a slave, The next mere dust and ashes in the grave, Endued with reason only to descry His crimes and follies with an aching eye, With passions, just that he may prove with pain The force he spends against their fury, vain; And if soon after having burnt by turns With every lust with which frail nature burns, His being end where death dissolves the bond, The tomb take all, and all be blank beyond, Then he, of all that nature has brought forth, Stands self-impeach'd the creature of least worth, And useless while he lives, and when he dies, Brings into doubt the wisdom of the skies. Truths that the learn'd pursue with eager thought, Are not important always as dear-bought, Proving at last, though told in pompous strains, A childish waste of philosophic pains; But truths on which depends our main concern, That 'tis our shame and misery not to learn, Shine by the side of every path we tread With such a lustre, he that runs may read. 'Tis true, that if to trifle life away Down to the sunset of their latest day, Then perish on futurity's wide shore Like fleeting exhalations, found no more, Were all that Heaven required of human kind, And all the plan their destiny designed, What none could reverence all might justly blame, And man would breathe but for his Maker's shame. But reason heard, and nature well perused, At once the dreaming mind is disabused, If all we find possessing earth, sea, air, Reflect his attributes who placed them there, Fulfil the purpose, and appear design'd Proofs of the wisdom of the all-seeing Mind, 'Tis plain, the creature whom he chose to invest With kingship and dominion o'er the rest, Received his nobler nature, and was made Fit for the power in which he stands array'd, That first or last, hereafter if not here, He too might make his Author's wisdom clear, Praise him on earth, or obstinately dumb Suffer his justice in a world to come. This once believed, 'twere logic misapplied To prove a consequence by none denied, That we are bound to cast the minds of youth Betimes into the mould of heavenly truth, That taught of God they may indeed be wise, Nor ignorantly wandering miss the skies. In early days the conscience has in most A quickness, which in later life is lost, Preserved from guilt by salutary fears, Or, guilty, soon relenting into tears. Too careless often as our years proceed, What friends we sort with, or what books we read, Our parents yet exert a prudent care To feed our infant minds with proper fare, And wisely store the nursery by degrees With wholesome learning, yet acquired with ease. Neatly secured from being soiled or torn Beneath a pane of thin translucent horn, A book (to please us at a tender age 'Tis call'd a book, though but a single page,) Presents the prayer the Saviour deign'd to teach, Which children use, and parsons—when they preach. Lisping our syllables, we scramble next, Through moral narrative, or sacred text, And learn with wonder how this world began, Who made, who marr'd, and who has ransom'd man: Points, which unless the Scripture made them plain, The wisest heads might agitate in vain. Oh thou, whom borne on fancy's eager wing Back to the season of life's happy spring, I pleased remember, and while memory yet Holds fast her office here, can ne'er forget, Ingenious dreamer, in whose well-told tale Sweet fiction and sweet truth alike prevail, Whose humorous vein, strong sense, and simple style, May teach the gayest, make the gravest smile, Witty, and well employed, and like thy Lord Speaking in parables his slighted word,— I name thee not, lest so despised a name Should move a sneer at thy deserved fame, Yet even in transitory life's late day That mingles all my brown with sober gray, Revere the man, whose Pilgrim marks the road And guides the Progress of the soul to God. 'Twere well with most, if books that could engage Their childhood, pleased them at a riper age; The man approving what had charm'd the boy, Would die at last in comfort, peace, and joy, And not with curses on his art who stole The gem of truth from his unguarded soul. The stamp of artless piety impress'd By kind tuition on his yielding breast, The youth now bearded, and yet pert and raw, Regards with scorn, though once received with awe, And warp'd into the labyrinth of lies That babblers, called philosophers, devise, Blasphemes his creed as founded on a plan Replete with dreams, unworthy of a man. Touch but his nature in its ailing part, Assert the native evil of his heart, His pride resents the charge, although the proof Rise in his forehead, and seem rank enough; Point to the cure, describe a Saviour's cross As God's expedient to retrieve his loss, The young apostate sickens at the view, And hates it with the malice of a Jew. How weak the barrier of mere nature proves Opposed against the pleasures nature loves! While self-betray'd, and wilfully undone, She longs to yield, no sooner wooed than won. Try now the merits of this blest exchange Of modest truth for wit's eccentric range. Time was, he closed as he began the day With decent duty, not ashamed to pray; The practice was a bond upon his heart, A pledge he gave for a consistent part, Nor could he dare presumptuously displease A power confess'd so lately on his knees. But now, farewell all lengendary tales, The shadows fly, philosophy prevails, Prayer to the winds and caution to the waves, Religion makes the free by nature slaves, Priests have invented, and the world admired What knavish priests promulgate as inspired, 'Till reason, now no longer overawed, Resumes her powers, and spurns the clumsy fraud, And common sense diffusing real day, The meteor of the gospel dies away. Such rhapsodies our shrewd discerning youth Learn from expert enquirers after truth, Whose only care, might truth presume to speak, Is not to find what they profess to seek. And thus well tutor'd only while we share A mother's lectures and a nurse's care, And taught at schools much mythologic stuff, But sound religion sparingly enough, Our early notices of truth disgraced Soon lose their credit, and are all effaced. Would you your son should be a sot or dunce, Lascivious, headstrong, or all these at once, That in good time, the stripling's finish'd taste For loose expense and fashionable waste Should prove your ruin, and his own at last, Train him in public with a mob of boys, Childish in mischief only and in noise, Else of a mannish growth, and five in ten In infidelity and lewdness, men. There shall he learn ere sixteen winters old, That authors are most useful, pawn'd or sold, That pedantry is all that schools impart, But taverns teach the knowledge of the heart; There waiter Dick with Bacchanalian lays Shall win his heart and have his drunken praise, His counsellor and bosom friend shall prove, And some street-pacing harlot his first love. Schools, unless discipline were doubly strong, Detain their adolescent charge too long. The management of Tiro's of eighteen Is difficult, their punishment obscene. The stout tall Captain, whose superior size The minor heroes view with envious eyes, Becomes their pattern, upon whom they fix Their whole attention, and ape all his tricks. His pride that scorns to obey or to submit, With them is courage, his effrontery wit; His wild excursions, window-breaking feats, Robbery of gardens, quarrels in the streets, His hair-breadth 'scapes, and all his daring schemes, Transport them and are made their favourite themes. In little bosoms such achievements strike A kindred spark, they burn to do the like. Thus half accomplish'd, ere he yet begin To show the peeping down upon his chin, And as maturity of years comes on Made just the adept that you designed your son, To insure the perseverance of his course, And give your monstrous project all its force, Send him to college. If he there be tamed, Or in one article of vice reclaimed, Where no regard of ord'nances is shown, Or look'd for now, the fault must be his own. Some sneaking virtue lurks in him no doubt, Where neither strumpet's charms nor drinking-bout, Nor gambling practices can find it out. Such youths of spirit, and that spirit too, Ye nurseries of our boys, we owe to you. Though from ourselves the mischief more proceeds, For public schools 'tis public folly feeds. The slaves of custom and establish'd mode, With pack-horse constancy we keep the road Crooked or straight, through quags or thorny dells, True to the jingling of our leader's bells. To follow foolish precedents, and wink With both our eyes, is easier than to think, And such an age as ours baulks no expense Except of caution and of common sense; Else, sure, notorious fact and proof so plain Would turn our steps into a wiser train. I blame not those who with what care they can O'erwatch the numerous and unruly clan, Or if I blame, 'tis only that they dare Promise a work of which they must despair. Have ye, ye sage intendants of the whole, An ubiquarian presence and controul, Elisha's eye, that when Gehazi stray'd Went with him, and saw all the game he play'd? Yes, ye are conscious; and on all the shelves Your pupils strike upon, have struck yourselves. Or if by nature sober, ye had then, Boys as ye were, the gravity of men, Ye knew at least, by constant proofs address'd To ears and eyes, the vices of the rest. But ye connive at what ye cannot cure, And evils not to be endured, endure, Lest power exerted, but without success, Should make the little ye retain still less. Ye once were justly famed for bringing forth Undoubted scholarship and genuine worth, And in the firmament of fame still shines A glory bright as that of all the signs Of poets raised by you, and statesmen and divines. Peace to them all, those brilliant times are fled, And no such lights are kindling in their stead. Our striplings shine indeed, but with such rays As set the midnight riot in a blaze, And seem, if judged by their expressive looks, Deeper in none than in their surgeons' books. Say, Muse, (for education made the song, No Muse can hesitate or linger long,) What causes move us, knowing as we must That these Menageries all fail their trust, To send our sons to scout and scamper there, While colts and puppies cost us so much care? Be it a weakness, it deserves some praise, We love the play-place of our early days. The scene is touching, and the heart is stone That feels not at that sight, and feels at none. The wall on which we tried our graving skill, The very name we carved subsisting still, The bench on which we sat while deep-employ'd Though mangled, hack'd and hew'd, not yet destroy'd; The little ones unbutton'd, glowing hot, Playing our games, and on the very spot, As happy as we once, to kneel and draw The chalky ring, and knuckle down at taw, To pitch the ball into the grounded hat, Or drive it devious with a dexterous pat; The pleasing spectacle at once excites Such recollection of our own delights, That viewing it, we seem almost to obtain Our innocent sweet simple years again. This fond attachment to the well-known place Whence first we started into life's long race, Maintains its hold with such unfailing sway, We feel it even in age, and at our latest day. Hark! how the sire of chits, whose future share Of classic food begins to be his care, With his own likeness placed on either knee, Indulges all a father's heart-felt glee, And tells them as he strokes their silver locks, That they must soon learn Latin and to box; Then turning, he regales his listening wife With all the adventures of his early life, His skill in coachmanship or driving chaise, In bilking tavern bills and spouting plays, What shifts he used detected in a scrape, How he was flogg'd, or had the luck to escape, What sums he lost at play, and how he sold Watch, seals, and all, till all his pranks are told. Retracing thus his frolics, ('tis a name That palliates deeds of folly and of shame,) He gives the local bias all its sway, Resolves that where he play'd his sons shall play, And destines their bright genius to be shown Just in the scene where he display'd his own. The meek and bashful boy will soon be taught To be as bold and forward as he ought; The rude will scuffle through with ease enough, Great schools suit best the sturdy and the rough. Ah happy designation, prudent choice, The' event is sure, expect it and rejoice! Soon see your wish fulfilled in either child, The pert made perter, and the tame made wild. The great indeed, by titles, riches, birth, Excused the encumbrance of more solid worth, Are best disposed of, where with most success They may acquire that confident address, Those habits of profuse and lewd expense, That scorn of all delights but those of sense, Which though in plain plebeians we condemn, With so much reason all expect from them. But families of less illustrious fame, Whose chief distinction is their spotless name, Whose heirs, their honours none, their income small, Must shine by true desert, or not at all, What dream they of, that with so little care They risk their hopes, their dearest treasure there? They dream of little Charles or William graced With wig prolix, down-flowing to his waist; They see the attentive crowds his talents draw, They hear him speak—the oracle of law. The father who designs his babe a priest, Dreams him episcopally such at least, And while the playful jockey scours the room Briskly, astride upon the parlour broom, In fancy sees him more superbly ride In coach with purple lined, and mitres on its side. Events improbable and strange as these, Which only a parental eye foresees, A public school shall bring to pass with ease. But how? resides such virtue in that air As must create an appetite for prayer? And will it breathe into him all the zeal That candidates for such a prize should feel, To take the lead and be the foremost still In all true worth and literary skill? “Ah blind to bright futurity, untaught The knowledge of the world, and dull of thought! Church-ladders are not always mounted best By learned Clerks and Latinists profess'd. The exalted prize demands an upward look, Not to be found by poring on a book. Small skill in Latin, and still less in Greek, Is more than adequate to all I seek; Let erudition grace him or not grace, I give the bauble but the second place; His wealth, fame, honours, all that I intend, Subsist and centre in one point, a friend. A friend, whate'er he studies or neglects, Shall give him consequence, heal all defects; His intercourse with peers and sons of peers,— There dawns the splendour of his future years, In that bright quarter his propitious skies Shall blush betimes, and there his glory rise. Your Lordship and your Grace, what school can teach A rhetoric equal to those parts of speech? What need of Homer's verse, or Tully's prose, Sweet interjections! if he learn but those? Let reverend churls his ignorance rebuke, Who starve upon a dog's-ear'd Pentateuch, The parson knows enough who knows a Duke.”— Egregious purpose! worthily begun In barbarous prostitution of your son, Pressed on his part by means that would disgrace A scrivener's clerk or footman out of place, And ending, if at last its end be gain'd, In sacrilege, in God's own house profaned. It may succeed; and if his sins should call For more than common punishment, it shall. The wretch shall rise, and be the thing on earth Least qualified in honour, learning, worth, To occupy a sacred, aweful post, In which the best and worthiest tremble most. The royal letters are a thing of course, A king that would might recommend his horse, And Deans no doubt and Chapters, with one voice, As bound in duty, would confirm the choice. Behold your Bishop! well he plays his part, Christian in name, and infidel in heart, Ghostly in office, earthly in his plan, A slave at court, elsewhere a lady's man, Dumb as a senator, and as a priest A piece of mere church-furniture at best; To live estranged from God his total scope, And his end sure, without one glimpse of hope. But fair although and feasible it seem, Depend not much upon your golden dream; For Providence that seems concern'd to exempt The hallowed bench from absolute contempt, In spite of all the wrigglers into place, Still keeps a seat or two for worth and grace; And therefore 'tis, that, though the sight be rare, We sometimes see a Lowth or Bagot there. Besides, school-friendships are not always found, Though fair in promise, permanent and sound. The most disinterested and virtuous minds In early years connected, time unbinds; New situations give a different cast Of habit, inclination, temper, taste, And he that seem'd our counterpart at first, Soon shows the strong similitude reversed. Young heads are giddy, and young hearts are warm, And make mistakes for manhood to reform. Boys are at best but pretty buds unblown, Whose scent and hues are rather guess'd than known. Each dreams that each is just what he appears, But learns his error in maturer years, When disposition, like a sail unfurl'd, Shows all its rents and patches to the world. If therefore, even when honest in design, A boyish friendship may so soon decline, 'Twere wiser sure to inspire a little heart With just abhorrence of so mean a part, Than set your son to work at a vile trade For wages so unlikely to be paid. Our public hives of puerile resort That are of chief and most approved report, To such base hopes in many a sordid soul Owe their repute in part, but not the whole. A principle, whose proud pretensions pass Unquestion'd, though the jewel be but glass, That with a world not often over-nice Ranks as a virtue, and is yet a vice, Or rather a gross compound, justly tried, Of envy, hatred, jealousy, and pride, Contributes most perhaps to enhance their fame, And Emulation is its specious name. Boys once on fire with that contentious zeal Feel all the rage that female rivals feel, The prize of beauty in a woman's eyes Not brighter than in theirs the scholar's prize. The spirit of that competition burns With all varieties of ill by turns, Each vainly magnifies his own success, Resents his fellow's, wishes it were less, Exults in his miscarriage if he fail, Deems his reward too great if he prevail, And labours to surpass him day and night, Less for improvement, than to tickle spite. The spur is powerful, and I grant its force; It pricks the genius forward in its course, Allows short time for play, and none for sloth, And felt alike by each, advances both, But judge where so much evil intervenes, The end, though plausible, not worth the means. Weigh, for a moment, classical desert Against a heart depraved and temper hurt, Hurt too perhaps for life, for early wrong Done to the nobler part, affects it long, And you are staunch indeed in learning's cause, If you can crown a discipline that draws Such mischiefs after it, with much applause. Connexion form'd for interest, and endear'd By selfish views, thus censured and cashier'd, And emulation, as engendering hate, Doom'd to a no less ignominious fate, The props of such proud seminaries fall, The Jachin and the Boaz of them all. Great schools rejected then, as those that swell Beyond a size that can be managed well, Shall royal institutions miss the bays, And small academies win all the praise? Force not my drift beyond its just intent, I praise a school as Pope a government; So take my judgement in his language dress'd, “Whate'er is best administer'd, is best.” Few boys are born with talents that excel, But all are capable of living well. Then ask not, whether limited or large, But, watch they strictly or neglect their charge? If anxious only that their boys may learn, While Morals languish, a despised concern, The great and small deserve one common blame, Different in size, but in effect the same. Much zeal in virtue's cause all teachers boast, Though motives of mere lucre sway the most. Therefore in towns and cities they abound, For there, the game they seek is easiest found, Though there, in spite of all that care can do, Traps to catch youth are most abundant too. If shrewd, and of a well-constructed brain, Keen in pursuit, and vigorous to retain, Your son come forth a prodigy of skill, As wheresoever taught, so form'd, he will, The pædagogue, with self-complacent air, Claims more than half the praise as his due share; But if with all his genius he betray, Not more intelligent, than loose and gay, Such vicious habits as disgrace his name, Threaten his health, his fortune, and his fame, Though want of due restraint alone have bred The symptoms that you see with so much dread, Unenvied there, he may sustain alone The whole reproach, the fault was all his own. Oh 'tis a sight to be with joy perused By all whom sentiment has not abused, New-fangled sentiment, the boasted grace Of those who never feel in the right place, A sight surpassed by none that we can show, Though Vestris on one leg still shine below, A father blest with an ingenuous son, Father and friend and tutor all in one. How? turn again to tales long since forgot, Æsop and Phædrus and the rest?—why not? He will not blush that has a father's heart, To take in childish plays a childish part, But bends his sturdy back to any toy That youth takes pleasure in, to please his boy; Then why resign into a stranger's hand A task as much within your own command, That God and nature and your interest too Seem with one voice to delegate to you? Why hire a lodging in a house unknown For one whose tenderest thoughts all hover round your own? This second weaning, needless as it is, How does it lacerate both your heart and his! The indented stick that loses day by day Notch after notch, till all are smooth'd away, Bears witness long ere his dismission come, With what intense desire he wants his home, But though the joys he hopes beneath your roof Bid fair enough to answer in the proof, Harmless and safe and natural as they are, A disappointment waits him even there: Arrived, he feels an unexpected change, He blushes, hangs his head, is shy and strange, No longer takes, as once, with fearless ease His favourite stand between his father's knees, But seeks the corner of some distant seat, And eyes the door, and watches a retreat, And least familiar where he should be most, Feels all his happiest privileges lost. Alas, poor boy!—the natural effect Of love by absence chilled into respect. Say, what accomplishments at school acquired Brings he to sweeten fruits so undesired? Thou well deservest an alienated son, Unless thy conscious heart acknowledge—none; None that in thy domestic snug recess, He had not made his own with more address, Though some perhaps that shock thy feeling mind, And better never learn'd, or left behind. Add too, that thus estranged thou canst obtain By no kind arts his confidence again, That here begins with most that long complaint Of filial frankness lost, and love grown faint, Which, oft neglected in life's waning years, A parent pours into regardless ears. Like caterpillars dangling under trees By slender threads, and swinging in the breeze, Which filthily bewray and sore disgrace The boughs in which are bred the unseemly race, While every worm industriously weaves And winds his web about the rivell'd leaves; So numerous are the follies that annoy The mind and heart of every sprightly boy, Imaginations noxious and perverse, Which admonition can alone disperse. The encroaching nuisance asks a faithful hand, Patient, affectionate, of high command, To check the procreation of a breed Sure to exhaust the plant on which they feed. 'Tis not enough that Greek or Roman page At stated hours his freakish thoughts engage, Even in his pastimes he requires a friend To warn, and teach him safely to unbend, O'er all his pleasures gently to preside, Watch his emotions and controul their tide, And levying thus, and with an easy sway, A tax of profit from his very play, To impress a value not to be erased On moments squander'd else, and running all to waste. And seems it nothing in a father's eye That unimproved those many moments fly? And is he well content, his son should find No nourishment to feed his growing mind But conjugated verbs, and nouns declined? For such is all the mental food purvey'd By public hackneys in the schooling trade, Who feed a pupil's intellect with store Of syntax truly, but with little more, Dismiss their cares when they dismiss their flock, Machines themselves, and govern'd by a clock. Perhaps a father blest with any brains Would deem it no abuse or waste of pains, To improve this diet at no great expense, With savoury truth and wholesome common sense, To lead his son for prospects of delight To some not steep though philosophic height, Thence to exhibit to his wondering eyes Yon circling worlds, their distance, and their size, The moons of Jove and Saturn's belted ball, And the harmonious order of them all; To show him in an insect or a flower, Such microscopic proofs of skill and power, As hid from ages past, God now displays To combat Atheists with in modern days; To spread the earth before him, and commend, With designation of the finger's end, Its various parts to his attentive note, Thus bringing home to him the most remote; To teach his heart to glow with generous flame Caught from the deeds of men of ancient fame, And more than all, with commendation due To set some living worthy in his view, Whose fair example may at once inspire A wish to copy what he must admire. Such knowledge gain'd betimes, and which appears, Though solid, not too weighty for his years, Sweet in itself, and not forbidding sport, When health demands it, of athletic sort, Would make him what some lovely boys have been, And more than one perhaps that I have seen, An evidence and reprehension both Of the mere school-boy's lean and tardy growth. Art thou a man professionally tied, With all thy faculties elsewhere applied, Too busy to intend a meaner care Than how to enrich thyself, and next, thine heir; Or art thou (as though rich, perhaps thou art,) But poor in knowledge, having none to impart,— Behold that figure, neat, though plainly clad, His sprightly mingled with a shade of sad, Not of a nimble tongue, though now and then Heard to articulate like other men, No jester, and yet lively in discourse, His phrase well chosen, clear, and full of force, And his address, if not quite French in ease, Not English stiff, but frank and form'd to please, Low in the world because he scorns its arts, A man of letters, manners, morals, parts, Unpatronized, and therefore little known, Wise for himself and his few friends alone, In him, thy well-appointed proxy see, Armed for a work too difficult for thee, Prepared by taste, by learning, and true worth, To form thy son, to strike his genius forth, Beneath thy roof, beneath thine eye to prove The force of discipline when back'd by love, To double all thy pleasure in thy child, His mind informed, his morals undefiled. Safe under such a wing, the boy shall show No spots contracted among grooms below, Nor taint his speech with meannesses design'd By footman Tom for witty and refined. There,—in his commerce with the liveried herd Lurks the contagion chiefly to be fear'd. For since (so fashion dictates) all who claim An higher than a mere plebeian fame, Find it expedient, come what mischief may. To entertain a thief or two in pay, And they that can afford the expense of more, Some half a dozen, and some half a score, Great cause occurs to save him from a band So sure to spoil him, and so near at hand, A point secured, if once he be supplied With some such Mentor always at his side. Are such men rare? perhaps they would abound Were occupation easier to be found, Were education, else so sure to fail, Conducted on a manageable scale, And schools that have outlived all just esteem, Exchanged for the secure domestic scheme. But having found him, be thou duke or earl, Show thou hast sense enough to prize the pearl, And as thou wouldst the advancement of thine heir In all good faculties beneath his care, Respect, as is but rational and just, A man deem'd worthy of so dear a trust. Despised by thee, what more can he expect From youthful folly, than the same neglect? A flat and fatal negative obtains That instant, upon all his future pains; His lessons tire, his mild rebukes offend, And all the instructions of thy son's best friend Are a stream choaked, or trickling to no end. Doom him not then to solitary meals, But recollect that he has sense, and feels, And, that possessor of a soul refined, An upright heart and cultivated mind, His post not mean, his talents not unknown, He deems it hard to vegetate alone. And if admitted at thy board he sit, Account him no just mark for idle wit, Offend not him whom modesty restrains From repartee, with jokes that he disdains, Much less transfix his feelings with an oath, Nor frown, unless he vanish with the cloth,— And trust me, his utility may reach To more than he is hired or bound to teach, Much trash unutter'd and some ills undone, Through reverence of the censor of thy son. But if thy table be indeed unclean, Foul with excess, and with discourse obscene, And thou a wretch, whom, following her old plan, The world accounts an honourable man, Because forsooth thy courage has been tried, And stood the test, perhaps on the wrong side, Though thou hadst never grace enough to prove That any thing but vice could win thy love; Or hast thou a polite, card-playing wife, Chained to the routs that she frequents, for life, Who, just when industry begins to snore, Flies, wing'd with joy, to some coach-crowded door, And thrice in every winter throngs thine own With half the chariots and sedans in town, Thyself meanwhile e'en shifting as thou mayst, Not very sober though, nor very chaste; Or is thine house, though less superb thy rank, If not a scene of pleasure, a mere blank, And thou at best, and in thy soberest mood, A trifler, vain, and empty of all good? Though mercy for thyself thou canst have none, Hear nature plead, show mercy to thy son. Saved from his home, where every day brings forth Some mischief fatal to his future worth, Find him a better in a distant spot, Within some pious pastor's humble cot, Where vile example (your's I chiefly mean, The most seducing and the oftenest seen,) May never more be stamp'd upon his breast, Not yet perhaps incurably impress'd. Where early rest makes early rising sure, Disease or comes not, or finds easy cure, Prevented much by diet neat and plain, Or if it enter, soon starved out again. Where all the attention of his faithful host Discreetly limited to two at most, May raise such fruits as shall reward his care, And not at last evaporate in air. Where stillness aiding study, and his mind Serene, and to his duties much inclined, Not occupied in day-dreams, as at home, Of pleasures past or follies yet to come, His virtuous toil may terminate at last In settled habit and decided taste. But whom do I advise? the fashion-led, The incorrigibly wrong, the deaf, the dead, Whom care and cool deliberation suit Not better much than spectacles a brute; Who if their sons some slight tuition share, Deem it of no great moment, whose, or where, Too proud to adopt the thoughts of one unknown, And much too gay to have any of their own. But courage, man! methought the Muse replied, Mankind are various, and the world is wide; The ostrich, silliest of the feather'd kind, And form'd of God without a parent's mind, Commits her eggs, incautious, to the dust, Forgetful that the foot may crush the trust; And while on public nurseries they rely, Not knowing, and too oft not caring why, Irrational in what they thus prefer, No few, that would seem wise, resemble her. But all are not alike. Thy warning voice May here and there prevent erroneous choice, And some perhaps, who, busy as they are, Yet make their progeny their dearest care, Whose hearts will ache once told what ills may reach Their offspring left upon so wild a beach, Will need no stress of argument to enforce The expedience of a less adventurous course. The rest will slight thy counsel, or condemn; But they have human feelings. Turn to them. To you then, tenants of life's middle state, Securely placed between the small and great, Whose character, yet undebauch'd, retains Two thirds of all the virtue that remains, Who wise yourselves, desire your sons should learn Your wisdom and your ways—to you I turn. Look round you on a world perversely blind, See what contempt is fallen on human kind; See wealth abused, and dignities misplaced, Great titles, offices, and trusts disgraced, Long lines of ancestry renown'd of old, Their noble qualities all quench'd and cold; See Bedlam's closeted and handcuff'd charge Surpass'd in frenzy by the mad at large; See great commanders making war a trade, Great lawyers, lawyers without study made, Churchmen, in whose esteem their blest employ Is odious, and their wages all their joy, Who far enough from furnishing their shelves With gospel lore, turn infidels themselves; See womanhood despised, and manhood shamed With infamy too nauseous to be named, Fops at all corners, lady-like in mien, Civeted fellows, smelt ere they are seen, Else coarse and rude in manners, and their tongue On fire with curses and with nonsense hung, Now flush'd with drunkenness, now with whoredom pale, Their breath a sample of last night's regale; See volunteers in all the vilest arts Men well endowed, of honourable parts, Design'd by nature wise, but self-made fools; All these, and more like these, were bred at schools. And if it chance, as sometimes chance it will, That though school bred, the boy be virtuous still, Such rare exceptions shining in the dark, Prove rather than impeach the just remark, As here and there a twinkling star descried Serves but to show how black is all beside. Now look on him whose very voice in tone Just echoes thine, whose features are thine own, And stroke his polish'd cheek of purest red, And lay thine hand upon his flaxen head, And say, my boy, the unwelcome hour is come, When thou, transplanted from thy genial home, Must find a colder soil and bleaker air, And trust for safety to a stranger's care; What character, what turn thou wilt assume From constant converse with I know not whom, Who there will court thy friendship, with what views, And, artless as thou art, whom thou wilt chuse, Though much depends on what thy choice shall be, Is all chance-medley and unknown to me. Canst thou, the tear just trembling on thy lids, And while the dreadful risk foreseen, forbids, Free too, and under no constraining force, Unless the sway of custom warp thy course, Lay such a stake upon the losing side, Merely to gratify so blind a guide? Thou canst not: Nature pulling at thine heart Condemns the unfatherly, the imprudent part. Thou wouldst not, deaf to Nature's tenderest plea, Turn him adrift upon a rolling sea, Nor say, go thither, conscious that there lay A brood of asps, or quicksands in his way; Then only govern'd by the self-same rule Of natural pity, send him not to school. No!—Guard him better: Is he not thine own, Thyself in miniature, thy flesh, thy bone? And hopest thou not ('tis every father's hope) That since thy strength must with thy years elope, And thou wilt need some comfort to assuage Health's last farewell, a staff of thine old age, That then, in recompense of all thy cares, Thy child shall show respect to thy grey hairs, Befriend thee, of all other friends bereft, And give thy life its only cordial left? Aware then how much danger intervenes, To compass that good end, forecast the means. His heart, now passive, yields to thy command; Secure it thine. Its key is in thine hand. If thou desert thy charge and throw it wide, Nor heed what guests there enter and abide, Complain not if attachments lewd and base Supplant thee in it, and usurp thy place. But if thou guard its secret chambers sure From vicious inmates and delights impure, Either his gratitude shall hold him fast, And keep him warm and filial to the last, Or if he prove unkind, (as who can say But being man, and therefore frail, he may,) One comfort yet shall cheer thine aged heart, Howe'er he slight thee, thou hast done thy part. Oh barbarous! wouldst thou with a Gothic hand Pull down the schools—what!—all the schools i'the land? Or throw them up to livery-nags and grooms? Or turn them into shops and auction rooms? —A captious question, Sir, and yours is one, Deserves an answer similar, or none. Wouldst thou, possessor of a flock, employ (Apprized that he is such) a careless boy, And feed him well, and give him handsome pay, Merely to sleep, and let them run astray? Survey our schools and colleges, and see A sight not much unlike my simile. From education, as the leading cause, The public character its colour draws, Thence the prevailing manners take their cast, Extravagant or sober, loose or chaste. And though I would not advertise them yet, Nor write on each—This Building to be let, Unless the world were all prepared to embrace A plan well worthy to supply their place, Yet backward as they are, and long have been, To cultivate and keep the morals clean, (Forgive the crime) I wish them, I confess, Or better managed, or encouraged less. THE DIVERTING HISTORY OF JOHN GILPIN, SHOWING HOW HE WENT FARTHER THAN HE INTENDED, AND CAME SAFE HOME AGAIN. John Gilpin was a citizen Of credit and renown, A train-band Captain eke was he Of famous London town. John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear, —Though wedded we have been These twice ten tedious years, yet we No holiday have seen. To-morrow is our wedding-day, And we will then repair Unto the Bell at Edmonton, All in a chaise and pair. My sister and my sister's child, Myself and children three Will fill the chaise, so you must ride On horseback after we. He soon replied—I do admire Of womankind but one, And you are she, my dearest dear, Therefore it shall be done. I am a linen-draper bold, As all the world doth know, And my good friend the Callender Will lend his horse to go. Quoth Mrs. Gilpin—That's well said; And for that wine is dear, We will be furnish'd with our own, Which is both bright and clear. John Gilpin kiss'd his loving wife, O'erjoyed was he to find That though on pleasure she was bent, She had a frugal mind. The morning came, the chaise was brought, But yet was not allow'd To drive up to the door, lest all Should say that she was proud. So three doors off the chaise was stay'd, Where they did all get in, Six precious souls, and all agog To dash through thick and thin. Smack went the whip, round went the wheel, Were never folk so glad, The stones did rattle underneath As if Cheapside were mad. John Gilpin at his horse's side Seized fast the flowing mane, And up he got in haste to ride, But soon came down again. For saddle-tree scarce reach'd had he, His journey to begin, When turning round his head he saw Three customers come in. So down he came, for loss of time Although it grieved him sore, Yet loss of pence, full well he knew, Would trouble him much more. 'Twas long before the customers Were suited to their mind, When Betty screaming came down stairs, “The wine is left behind.” Good lack! quoth he, yet bring it me, My leathern belt likewise In which I bear my trusty sword When I do exercise. Now Mistress Gilpin, careful soul, Had two stone bottles found, To hold the liquor that she loved, And keep it safe and sound. Each bottle had a curling ear, Through which the belt he drew, And hung a bottle on each side To make his balance true. Then over all, that he might be Equipp'd from top to toe, His long red cloak well brush'd and neat He manfully did throw. Now see him mounted once again Upon his nimble steed, Full slowly pacing o'er the stones With caution and good heed. But finding soon a smoother road Beneath his well-shod feet, The snorting beast began to trot, Which gall'd him in his seat. So, Fair and softly, John he cried, But John he cried in vain, That trot became a gallop soon In spite of curb and rein. So stooping down, as needs he must Who cannot sit upright, He grasp'd the mane with both his hands And eke with all his might. His horse, who never in that sort Had handled been before, What thing upon his back had got Did wonder more and more. Away went Gilpin neck or nought, Away went hat and wig, He little dreamt when he set out Of running such a rig. The wind did blow, the cloak did fly, Like streamer long and gay, Till loop and button failing both At last it flew away. Then might all people well discern The bottles he had slung, A bottle swinging at each side As hath been said or sung. The dogs did bark, the children scream'd, Up flew the windows all, And every soul cried out, Well done! As loud as he could bawl. Away went Gilpin—who but he; His fame soon spread around— He carries weight, he rides a race, 'Tis for a thousand pound. And still as fast as he drew near, 'Twas wonderful to view How in a trice the turnpike-men Their gates wide open threw. And now as he went bowing down His reeking head full low, The bottles twain behind his back Were shatter'd at a blow. Down ran the wine into the road Most piteous to be seen, Which made his horse's flanks to smoke As they had basted been. But still he seem'd to carry weight, With leathern girdle braced, For all might see the bottle necks Still dangling at his waist. Thus all through merry Islington These gambols he did play, And till he came unto the Wash Of Edmonton so gay. And there he threw the wash about On both sides of the way, Just like unto a trundling mop, Or a wild-goose at play. At Edmonton his loving wife From the balcony spied Her tender husband, wondering much To see how he did ride. Stop, stop, John Gilpin!—Here's the house— They all at once did cry, The dinner waits and we are tired: Said Gilpin—so am I. But yet his horse was not a whit Inclined to tarry there, For why? his owner had a house Full ten miles off, at Ware. So like an arrow swift he flew Shot by an archer strong, So did he fly—which brings me to The middle of my song. Away went Gilpin, out of breath, And sore against his will, Till at his friend's the Callender's His horse at last stood still. The Callender amazed to see His neighbour in such trim, Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate, And thus accosted him— What news? what news? your tidings tell, Tell me you must and shall— Say why bare-headed you are come, Or why you come at all? Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit And loved a timely joke, And thus unto the Callender In merry guise he spoke— I came because your horse would come; And if I well forebode, My hat and wig will soon be here, They are upon the road. The Callender, right glad to find His friend in merry pin, Return'd him not a single word, But to the house went in. Whence straight he came with hat and wig, A wig that flow'd behind, A hat not much the worse for wear, Each comely in its kind. He held them up, and in his turn Thus show'd his ready wit, —My head is twice as big as yours, They therefore needs must fit. But let me scrape the dirt away That hangs upon your face; And stop and eat, for well you may Be in a hungry case. Said John—It is my wedding-day, And all the world would stare, If wife should dine at Edmonton And I should dine at Ware. So turning to his horse, he said, I am in haste to dine, 'Twas for your pleasure you came here, You shall go back for mine. Ah luckless speech, and bootless boast! For which he paid full dear, For while he spake a braying ass Did sing most loud and clear. Whereat his horse did snort as he Had heard a lion roar, And gallop'd off with all his might As he had done before. Away went Gilpin, and away Went Gilpin's hat and wig; He lost them sooner than at first, For why? they were too big. Now Mistress Gilpin, when she saw Her husband posting down Into the country far away, She pull'd out half a crown; And thus unto the youth she said That drove them to the Bell, This shall be yours when you bring back My husband safe and well. The youth did ride, and soon did meet John coming back amain, Whom in a trice he tried to stop By catching at his rein. But not performing what he meant, And gladly would have done, The frighted steed he frighted more And made him faster run. Away went Gilpin, and away Went post-boy at his heels, The post-boy's horse right glad to miss The lumbering of the wheels. Six gentlemen upon the road Thus seeing Gilpin fly, With post-boy scampering in the rear, They raised the hue and cry. Stop thief, stop thief—a highwayman! Not one of them was mute, And all and each that pass'd that way Did join in the pursuit. And now the turnpike gates again Flew open in short space, The toll-men thinking as before That Gilpin rode a race. And so he did and won it too, For he got first to town, Nor stopp'd till where he had got up He did again get down. Now let us sing, Long live the king, And Gilpin long live he, And when he next doth ride abroad, May I be there to see! THE DISTRESSED TRAVELLERS; OR, LABOUR IN VAIN. An excellent New Song, to a Tune never sung before. 1 I sing of a journey to Clifton, We would have perform'd if we could, Without cart or barrow to lift on Poor Mary and me through the mud; Slee sla slud, Stuck in the mud, Oh it is pretty to wade through a flood! 2 So away we went, slipping and sliding, Hop, hop, a la mode de deux frogs. 'Tis near as good walking as riding, When ladies are dress'd in their clogs. Wheels, no doubt, Go briskly about, But they clatter and rattle, and make such a rout! She.Well! now I protest it is charming; How finely the weather improves! That cloud, though, is rather alarming; How slowly and stately it moves! He. Pshaw! never mind; 'Tis not in the wind; We are travelling south, and shall leave it behind. She.I am glad we are come for an airing, For folks may be pounded and penn'd, Until they grow rusty, not caring To stir half a mile to an end.He. The longer we stay, The longer we may; It's a folly to think about weather or way. She.But now I begin to be frighted: If I fall, what a way I should roll! I am glad that the bridge was indicted.— Stop! stop! I am sunk in a hole! He. Nay, never care! 'Tis a common affair; You'll not be the last that will set a foot there. She.Let me breathe now a little, and ponder On what it were better to do. That terrible lane, I see yonder, I think we shall never get through! He. So think I; But, by the bye, We never shall know, if we never should try. She.But should we get there, how shall we get home? What a terrible deal of bad road we have past, Slipping and sliding; and if we should come To a difficult stile, I am ruined at last. Oh this lane! Now it is plain That struggling and striving is labour in vain. He. Stick fast there, while I go and look. She. Don't go away, for fear I should fall! He. I have examined it every nook, And what you have here is a sample of all. Come, wheel round; The dirt we have found Would be an estate at a farthing a pound. 9 Now, Sister Anne, the guitar you must take; Set it, and sing it, and make it a song. I have varied the verse for variety sake, And cut it off short, because it was long. 'Tis hobbling and lame, Which critics won't blame, For the sense and the sound, they say, should be the same. A TALE, FOUNDED ON A FACT, WHICH HAPPENED IN JANUARY, 1779. Where Humber pours his rich commercial stream, There dwelt a wretch, who breathed but to blaspheme. In subterraneous caves his life he led, Black as the mine, in which he wrought for bread. When on a day, emerging from the deep, A sabbath-day, (such sabbaths thousands keep!) The wages of his weekly toil he bore To buy a cock—whose blood might win him more; As if the noblest of the feather'd kind Were but for battle and for death design'd; As if the consecrated hours were meant For sport, to minds on cruelty intent. It chanced, (such chances Providence obey,) He met a fellow-labourer on the way, Whose heart the same desires had once inflamed, But now the savage temper was reclaim'd. Persuasion on his lips had taken place; For all plead well who plead the cause of grace. His iron-heart with Scripture he assail'd, Woo'd him to hear a sermon, and prevail'd. His faithful bow the mighty preacher drew, Swift as the lightning-glimpse the arrow flew. He wept; he trembled; cast his eyes around, To find a worse than he; but none he found. He felt his sins, and wonder'd he should feel. Grace made the wound, and grace alone could heal. Now farewell oaths, and blasphemies, and lies! He quits the sinner's for the martyr's prize. That holy day was wash'd with many a tear, Gilded with hope, yet shaded too by fear. The next his swarthy brethren of the mine Learn'd by his alter'd speech, the change divine, Laugh'd when they should have wept, and swore the day Was nigh when he would swear as fast as they. “No,” said the penitent: “such words shall share This breath no more; devoted now to prayer. O! if thou seest, (thine eye the future sees,) That I shall yet again blaspheme, like these, Now strike me to the ground, on which I kneel, Ere yet this heart relapses into steel; Now take me to that Heaven I once defied, Thy presence, thy embrace!”—He spoke and died! TO THE REV. MR. NEWTON, ON HIS RETURN FROM RAMSGATE. Oct. 1780. That ocean you have late survey'd, Those rocks I too have seen; But I, afflicted and dismay'd, You tranquil and serene. You from the flood-controlling steep Saw stretch'd before your view, With conscious joy, the threatening deep, No longer such to you. To me, the waves that ceaseless broke Upon the dangerous coast, Hoarsely and ominously spoke Of all my treasure lost. Your sea of troubles you have past, And found the peaceful shore; I, tempest-toss'd, and wreck'd at last, Come home to port no more. LOVE ABUSED. What is there in the vale of life Half so delightful as a wife, When friendship, love, and peace combine To stamp the marriage bond divine? The stream of pure and genuine love Derives its current from above; And earth a second Eden shows, Where'er the healing water flows: But ah, if from the dikes and drains Of sensual Nature's feverish veins, Lust, like a lawless headstrong flood, Impregnated with ooze and mud, Descending fast on every side Once mingles with the sacred tide, Farewell the soul-enlivening scene! The banks that wore a smiling green, With rank defilement overspread, Bewail their flowery beauties dead; The stream polluted, dark, and dull, Diffused into a Stygian pool, Through life's last melancholy years Is fed with ever-flowing tears, Complaints supply the zephyr's part, And sighs that heave a breaking heart. A POETICAL EPISTLE TO LADY AUSTEN, Dec. 17, 1781. Dear Anna—between friend and friend, Prose answers every common end; Serves, in a plain and homely way, To express the occurrence of the day; Our health, the weather, and the news, What walks we take, what books we choose, And all the floating thoughts we find Upon the surface of the mind. But when a poet takes the pen, Far more alive than other men, He feels a gentle tingling come Down to his finger and his thumb, Derived from nature's noblest part, The centre of a glowing heart: And this is what the world, who knows No flights above the pitch of prose, His more sublime vagaries slighting, Denominates an itch for writing. No wonder I, who scribble rhyme To catch the triflers of the time, And tell them truths divine and clear, Which, couch'd in prose, they will not hear; Who labour hard to allure and draw The loiterers I never saw, Should feel that itching and that tingling With all my purpose intermingling, To your intrinsic merit true, When call'd to address myself to you. Mysterious are His ways, whose power Brings forth that unexpected hour, When minds, that never met before, Shall meet, unite, and part no more: It is the' allotment of the skies, The hand of the Supremely Wise, That guides and governs our affections, And plans and orders our connexions: Directs us in our distant road, And marks the bounds of our abode. Thus we were settled when you found us, Peasants and children all around us, Not dreaming of so dear a friend, Deep in the abyss of Silver-End. Thus Martha, even against her will, Perch'd on the top of yonder hill; And you, though you must needs prefer The fairer scenes of sweet Sancerre, Are come from distant Loire, to choose A cottage on the banks of Ouse. This page of Providence quite new, And now just opening to our view, Employs our present thoughts and pains To guess, and spell, what it contains: But day by day, and year by year, Will make the dark enigma clear; And furnish us, perhaps, at last, Like other scenes already past, With proof, that we, and our affairs, Are part of a Jehovah's cares: For God unfolds, by slow degrees, The purport of his deep decrees; Sheds every hour a clearer light In aid of our defective sight; And spreads, at length, before the soul A beautiful and perfect whole, Which busy man's inventive brain Toils to anticipate, in vain. Say, Anna, had you never known The beauties of a rose full blown, Could you, though luminous your eye, By looking on the bud descry, Or guess, with a prophetic power, The future splendour of the flower? Just so, the Omnipotent, who turns The system of a world's concerns, From mere minutiæ can educe Events of most important use, And bid a dawning sky display The blaze of a meridian day. The works of man tend, one and all, As needs they must, from great to small; And vanity absorbs at length The monuments of human strength. But who can tell how vast the plan Which this day's incident began? Too small, perhaps, the slight occasion For our dim-sighted observation; It pass'd unnoticed, as the bird That cleaves the yielding air unheard, And yet may prove, when understood, An harbinger of endless good. Not that I deem, or mean to call Friendship a blessing cheap or small; But merely to remark, that ours, Like some of nature's sweetest flowers, Rose from a seed of tiny size, That seem'd to promise no such prize; A transient visit intervening, And made almost without a meaning, (Hardly the effect of inclination, Much less of pleasing expectation,) Produced a friendship, then begun, That has cemented us in one; And placed it in our power to prove, By long fidelity and love, That Solomon has wisely spoken,— “A threefold cord is not soon broken.” TO THE REV. MR. NEWTON, RECTOR OF ST. MARY WOOLNOTH, May 28, 1782. Says the Pipe to the Snuff-box, I can't understand What the ladies and gentlemen see in your face, That you are in fashion all over the land, And I am so much fallen into disgrace. Do but see what a pretty contemplative air I give to the company,—pray do but note 'em,— You would think that the wise men of Greece were all there, Or, at least, would suppose them the wise men of Gotham. My breath is as sweet as the breath of blown roses, While you are a nuisance where'er you appear; There is nothing but sniveling and blowing of noses, Such a noise as turns any man's stomach to hear. Then lifting his lid in a delicate way, And opening his mouth with a smile quite engaging, The Box in reply was heard plainly to say,— What a silly dispute is this we are waging! If you have a little of merit to claim, You may thank the sweet-smelling Virginian weed; And I, if I seem to deserve any blame, The before-mentioned drug in apology plead. Thus neither the praise nor the blame is our own, No room for a sneer, much less a cachinnus; We are vehicles, not of tobacco alone, But of any thing else they may choose to put in us. THE COLUBRIAD. 1782. Close by the threshold of a door nail'd fast Three kittens sat; each kitten look'd aghast; I passing swift and inattentive by, At the three kittens cast a careless eye, Not much concern'd to know what they did there, Not deeming kittens worth a poet's care. But presently a loud and furious hiss Caused me to stop, and to exclaim “What's this?” When lo! upon the threshold met my view, With head erect, and eyes of fiery hue, A viper, long as Count de Grasse's queue. Forth from his head his forked tongue he throws, Darting it full against a kitten's nose, Who having never seen, in field or house, The like, sat still and silent as a mouse; Only projecting, with attention due, Her whisker'd face, she ask'd him, “Who are you?” On to the hall went I, with pace not slow, But swift as lightning, for a long Dutch hoe, With which well arm'd I hasten'd to the spot, To find the viper,—but I found him not; And turning up the leaves, and shrubs around, Found only, that he was not to be found. But still the kittens, sitting as before, Sat watching close the bottom of the door. “I hope,” said I, “the villain I would kill Has slipp'd between the door and the door sill; And if I make dispatch, and follow hard, No doubt but I shall find him in the yard;” For long ere now it should have been rehearsed, 'Twas in the garden that I found him first. Even there I found him, there the full-grown cat His head, with velvet paw, did gently pat, As curious as the kittens erst had been To learn what this phenomenon might mean. Fill'd with heroic ardour at the sight, And fearing every moment he would bite, And rob our household of our only cat That was of age to combat with a rat, With outstretch'd hoe I slew him at the door, And taught him never to come there no more. ON FRIENDSHIP. Amicitia nisi inter bonos esse non potest. Cicero. 1782. What virtue can we name, or grace, But men unqualified and base Will boast it their possession? Profusion apes the noble part Of liberality of heart, And dullness of discretion. But as the gem of richest cost Is ever counterfeited most, So, always, imitation Employs the utmost skill she can To counterfeit the faithful man, The friend of long duration. Some will pronounce me too severe, But long experience speaks me clear; Therefore that censure scorning, I will proceed to mark the shelves On which so many dash themselves, And give the simple warning. Youth, unadmonish'd by a guide, Will trust to any fair outside,— An error soon corrected; For who but learns with riper years, That man, when smoothest he appears, Is most to be suspected? But here again a danger lies, Lest, thus deluded by our eyes, And taking trash for treasure, We should, when undeceived, conclude Friendship imaginary good, A mere Utopian pleasure. An acquisition rather rare Is yet no subject of despair; Nor should it seem distressful, If either on forbidden ground, Or where it was not to be found, We sought it unsuccessful. No friendship will abide the test That stands on sordid interest And mean self-love erected; Nor such as may awhile subsist 'Twixt sensualist and sensualist, For vicious ends connected. Who hopes a friend, should have a heart Himself well furnish'd for the part, And ready on occasion To show the virtue that he seeks; For 'tis an union that bespeaks A just reciprocation. A fretful temper will divide The closest knot that may be tied, By ceaseless sharp corrosion: A temper passionate and fierce May suddenly your joys disperse At one immense explosion. In vain the talkative unite With hope of permanent delight; The secret just committed They drop through mere desire to prate, Forgetting its important weight, And by themselves outwitted. How bright soe'er the prospect seems, All thoughts of friendship are but dreams, If envy chance to creep in; An envious man, if you succeed, May prove a dangerous foe indeed, But not a friend worth keeping. As envy pines at good possess'd, So jealousy looks forth distress'd, On good that seems approaching, And if success his steps attend, Discerns a rival in a friend, And hates him for encroaching. Hence authors of illustrious name, (Unless belied by common fame,) Are sadly prone to quarrel; To deem the wit a friend displays So much of loss to their own praise, And pluck each other's laurel. A man renowned for repartee Will seldom scruple to make free With friendship's finest feeling; Will thrust a dagger at your breast, And tell you 'twas a special jest, By way of balm for healing. Beware of tattlers; keep your ear Close stopt against the tales they hear,— Fruits of their own invention; The separation of chief friends Is what their kindness most intends; Their sport is your dissension. Friendship that wantonly admits A joco-serious play of wits In brilliant altercation, Is union such as indicates, Like hand-in-hand insurance plates, Danger of conflagration. Some fickle creatures boast a soul True as the needle to the pole; Yet shifting, like the weather, The needle's constancy forego For any novelty, and show Its variations rather. Insensibility makes some Unseasonably deaf and dumb, When most you need their pity; 'Tis waiting till the tears shall fall From Gog and Magog in Guildhall,— Those playthings of the city. The great and small but rarely meet On terms of amity complete: The attempt would scarce be madder, Should any, from the bottom, hope At one huge stride to reach the top Of an erected ladder. Courtier and patriot cannot mix Their heterogeneous politics Without an effervescence, Such as of salts with lemon-juice, But which is rarely known to induce, Like that, a coalescence. Religion should extinguish strife, And make a calm of human life: But even those who differ Only on topics left at large, How fiercely will they meet and charge! No combatants are stiffer. To prove, alas! my main intent, Needs no great cost of argument, No cutting and contriving; Seeking a real friend, we seem To adopt the chymist's golden dream With still less hope of thriving. Then judge, or ere you choose your man, As circumspectly as you can, And, having made election, See that no disrespect of yours, Such as a friend but ill endures, Enfeeble his affection. It is not timber, lead and stone, An architect requires alone, To finish a great building; The palace were but half complete, Could he by any chance forget The carving and the gilding. As similarity of mind, Or something not be defined, First rivets our attention; So, manners, decent and polite, The same we practised at first sight, Must save it from declension. The man who hails you Tom or Jack, And proves by thumping on your back, His sense of your great merit, Is such a friend, that one had need Be very much his friend indeed, To pardon, or to bear it. Some friends make this their prudent plan— “Say little, and hear all you can;” Safe policy, but hateful; So barren sands imbibe the shower, But render neither fruit nor flower, Unpleasant and ungrateful. They whisper trivial things, and small; But, to communicate at all Things serious, deem improper; Their feculence and froth they show, But keep the best contents below, Just like a simmering copper. These samples (for alas! at last These are but samples, and a taste Of evils yet unmention'd;) May prove the task, a task indeed, In which 'tis much, if we succeed, However well-intention'd. Pursue the theme, and you shall find A disciplined and furnish'd mind To be at least expedient, And, after summing all the rest, Religion ruling in the breast A principal ingredient. True friendship has, in short, a grace More than terrestrial in its face, That proves it Heaven-descended; Man's love of woman not so pure, Nor, when sincerest, so secure To last till life is ended. TO AN AFFLICTED PROTESTANT LADY IN FRANCE. MADAM, A strange's purpose in these lays Is to congratulate and not to praise; To give the creature the Creator's due Were sin in me, and an offence to you. From man to man, or e'en to woman paid, Praise is the medium of a knavish trade, A coin by Craft for Folly's use design'd, Spurious, and only current with the blind. The path of sorrow, and that path alone Leads to the land where sorrow is unknown: No traveller ever reach'd that bless'd abode, Who found not thorns and briers in his road. The world may dance along the flowery plain, Cheer'd as they go by many a sprightly strain; Where Nature has her mossy velvet spread, With unshod feet they yet securely tread; Admonish'd, scorn the caution and the friend, Bent all on pleasure, heedless of its end. But He, who knew what human hearts would prove, How slow to learn the dictates of his love, That, hard by nature and of stubborn will, A life of ease would make them harder still, In pity to the souls his grace design'd To rescue from the ruins of mankind, Call'd for a cloud to darken all their years, And said, “Go spend them in the vale of tears!” O balmy gales of soul-reviving air! O salutary streams that murmur there! These flowing from the Fount of Grace above, Those breathed from lips of everlasting love. The flinty soil indeed their feet annoys, Chill blasts of trouble nip their springing joys, An envious world will interpose its frown To mar delights superior to its own, And many a pang experienced still within, Reminds them of their hated inmate, Sin; But ills of every shape and every name, Transform'd to blessings, miss their cruel aim; And every moment's calm that sooths the breast Is given in earnest of eternal rest. Ah, be not sad, although thy lot be cast Far from the flock, and in a boundless waste! No shepherd's tents within thy view appear, But the chief Shepherd even there is near; Thy tender sorrows and thy plaintive strain Flow in a foreign land, but not in vain; Thy tears all issue from a source divine, And every drop bespeaks a Saviour thine. So once in Gideon's fleece the dews were found, And drought on all the drooping herbs around. THE YEARLY DISTRESS; OR, TITHING-TIME AT STOCK IN ESSEX. VERSES ADDRESSED TO A COUNTRY CLERGYMAN, COMPLAINING OF THE DISAGREEABLENESS OF THE DAY ANNUALLY APPOINTED FOR RECEIVING THE DUES AT THE PARSONAGE. Come, ponder well, for 'tis no jest, To laugh it would be wrong; The troubles of a worthy priest The burden of my song. This priest he merry is and blithe Three quarters of the year, But oh! it cuts him like a scythe When tithing-time draws near. He then is full of frights and fears, As one at point to die, And long before the day appears He heaves up many a sigh. For then the farmers come, jog, jog, Along the miry road, Each heart as heavy as a log, To make their payments good. In sooth the sorrow of such days Is not to be express'd, When he that takes and he that pays Are both alike distress'd. Now all unwelcome at his gates The clumsy swains alight, With rueful faces and bald pates;— He trembles at the sight. And well he may, for well he knows Each bumpkin of the clan, Instead of paying what he owes, Will cheat him if he can. So in they come—each makes his leg, And flings his head before, And looks as if he came to beg, And not to quit a score. “And how does miss and madam do, The little boy and all?” “All tight and well. And how do you, Good Mr. What-d'ye-call?” The dinner comes, and down they sit: Were e'er such hungry folk? There's little talking, and no wit; It is no time to joke. One wipes his nose upon his sleeve, One spits upon the floor, Yet not to give offence or grieve, Holds up the cloth before. The punch goes round, and they are dull And lumpish still as ever; Like barrels with their bellies full, They only weigh the heavier. At length the busy time begins, “Come, neighbours, we must wag.” The money chinks, down drop their chins, Each lugging out his bag. One talks of mildew and of frost, And one of storms and hail, And one of pigs that he has lost By maggots at the tail. Quoth one, “A rarer man than you In pulpit none shall hear; But yet, methinks, to tell you true, You sell it plaguey dear.” Oh why are farmers made so coarse, Or clergy made so fine? A kick that scarce would move a horse, May kill a sound divine. Then let the boobies stay at home; 'Twould cost him, I dare say, Less trouble taking twice the sum, Without the clowns that pay. SONNET TO HENRY COWPER, ESQ. ON HIS EMPHATICAL AND INTERESTING DELIVERY OF THE DEFENCE OF WARREN HASTINGS, ESQ. IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS. Cowper, whose silver voice, task'd sometimes hard, Legends prolix delivers in the ears (Attentive when thou read'st) of England's peers, Let verse at length yield thee thy just reward. Thou wast not heard with drowsy disregard, Expending late on all that length of plea Thy generous powers, but silence honour'd thee, Mute as e'er gazed on orator or bard. Thou art not voice alone, but hast beside Both heart and head: and couldst with music sweet Of attic phrase and senatorial tone, Like thy renown'd forefathers, far and wide Thy fame diffuse, praised not for utterance meet Of others' speech, but magic of thy own. LINES ADDRESSED TO DR. DARWIN, AUTHOR OF THE “BOTANIC GARDEN.” Two Poets, (poets, by report, Not oft so well agree,) Sweet harmonist of Flora's court! Conspire to honour thee. They best can judge a poet's worth, Who oft themselves have known The pangs of a poetic birth By labours of their own. We therefore pleased extol thy song, Though various yet complete, Rich in embellishment as strong, And learned as 'tis sweet. No envy mingles with our praise; Though, could our hearts repine At any poet's happier lays, They would—they must at thine. But we, in mutual bondage knit Of friendship's closest tie, Can gaze on even Darwin's wit With an unjaundiced eye; And deem the Bard, whoe'er he be, And howsoever known, Who would not twine a wreath for thee, Unworthy of his own. ON MRS. MONTAGU'S FEATHER HANGINGS. The Birds put off their every hue, To dress a room for Montagu. The Peacock sends his heavenly dyes, His rainbows and his starry eyes; The Pheasant, plumes which round infold His mantling neck with downy gold; The Cock his arch'd tail's azure show; And, river blanch'd, the Swan his snow. All tribes beside of Indian name, That glossy shine, or vivid flame, Where rises and where sets the day, Whate'er they boast of rich and gay, Contribute to the gorgeous plan, Proud to advance it all they can. This plumage neither dashing shower, Nor blasts that shake the dripping bower, Shall drench again or discompose, But, screen'd from every storm that blows, It boasts a splendour ever new, Safe with protecting Montagu. To the same patroness resort, Secure of favour at her court, Strong Genius, from whose forge of thought Forms rise, to quick perfection wrought, Which, though newborn, with vigour move, Like Pallas springing arm'd from Jove; Imagination scattering round Wild roses over furrow'd ground, Which Labour of his frown beguile, And teach Philosophy a smile; Wit flashing on Religion's side, Whose fires, to sacred truth applied, The gem, though luminous before, Obtrudes on human notice more, Like sunbeams on the golden height Of some tall temple playing bright; Well-tutor'd Learning, from his books Dismiss'd with grave, not haughty looks, Their order on his shelves exact, Not more harmonious or compact Than that, to which he keeps confined The various treasures of his mind; All these to Montagu's repair, Ambitious of a shelter there. There Genius, Learning, Fancy, Wit, Their ruffled plumage calm refit, (For stormy troubles loudest roar Around their flight who highest soar,) And in her eye, and by her aid, Shine safe without a fear to fade. She thus maintains divided sway With yon bright regent of the day; The plume and Poet both, we know, Their lustre to his influence owe; And she, the works of Phœbus aiding, Both Poet saves and plume from fading. ON THE DEATH OF MRS. THROCKMORTON'S BULLFINCH. Ye Nymphs, if e'er your eyes were red With tears o'er hapless favourites shed, O, share Maria's grief! Her favourite, even in his cage, (What will not hunger's cruel rage?) Assassin'd by a thief. Where Rhenus strays his vines among, The egg was laid from which he sprung, And though by nature mute, Or only with a whistle bless'd, Well-taught he all the sounds express'd Of flageolet or flute. The honours of his ebon poll Were brighter than the sleekest mole, His bosom of the hue With which Aurora decks the skies, When piping winds shall soon arise To sweep away the dew. Above, below, in all the house, Dire foe alike of bird and mouse, No cat had leave to dwell; And Bully's cage supported stood On props of smoothest-shaven wood, Large built and latticed well. Well latticed,—but the grate, alas! Not rough with wire of steel or brass, For Bully's plumage sake, But smooth with wands from Ouse's side, With which, when neatly peel'd and dried, The swains their baskets make. Night veil'd the pole: all seem'd secure: When, led by instinct sharp and sure, Subsistence to provide, A beast forth sallied on the scout, Long back'd, long tail'd, with whisker'd snout, And badger-colour'd hide. He, entering at the study door, Its ample area 'gan explore; And something in the wind Conjectured, sniffing round and round, Better than all the books he found, Food chiefly for the mind. Just then, by adverse fate impress'd, A dream disturb'd poor Bully's rest; In sleep he seem'd to view A rat fast clinging to the cage, And, screaming at the sad presage, Awoke and found it true. For, aided both by ear and scent, Right to his mark the monster went,— Ah, Muse! forbear to speak Minute the horrors that ensued; His teeth were strong, the cage was wood,— He left poor Bully's beak. O, had he made that too his prey! That beak, whence issued many a lay Of such mellifluous tone, Might have repaid him well, I wote, For silencing so sweet a throat, Fast stuck within his own. Maria weeps,—the Muses mourn;— So, when by Bacchanalians torn, On Thracian Hebrus' side The tree-enchanter Orpheus fell, His head alone remain'd to tell The cruel death he died. THE ROSE. The rose had been wash'd, just wash'd in a shower, Which Mary to Anna convey'd; The plentiful moisture encumber'd the flower, And weigh'd down its beautiful head. The cup was all fill'd, and the leaves were all wet, And it seem'd, to a fanciful view, To weep for the buds it had left with regret On the flourishing bush where it grew. I hastily seized it, unfit as it was For a nosegay, so dripping and drown'd, And swinging it rudely, too rudely, alas! I snapp'd it; it fell to the ground. And such, I exclaim'd, is the pitiless part Some act by the delicate mind, Regardless of wringing and breaking a heart Already to sorrow resign'd. This elegant rose, had I shaken it less, Might have bloom'd with its owner awhile; And the tear that is wiped with a little address, May be follow'd perhaps by a smile. ODE TO APOLLO. ON AN INK-GLASS ALMOST DRIED IN THE SUN. Patron of all those luckless brains That, to the wrong side leaning, Indite much metre with much pains, And little or no meaning; Ah, why, since oceans, rivers, streams, That water all the nations, Pay tribute to thy glorious beams, In constant exhalations; Why, stooping from the noon of day, Too covetous of drink, Apollo, hast thou stolen away A poet's drop of ink? Upborne into the viewless air, It floats a vapour now, Impell'd through regions dense and rare, By all the winds that blow; Ordain'd perhaps ere summer flies, Combined with millions more, To form an Iris in the skies, Though black and foul before. Illustrious drop! and happy then Beyond the happiest lot, Of all that ever pass'd my pen, So soon to be forgot! Phœbus, if such be thy design, To place it in thy bow, Give wit, that what is left may shine With equal grace below. THE POET'S NEW-YEAR'S GIFT. TO MRS. (AFTERWARDS LADY) THROCKMORTON. Maria! I have every good For thee wish'd many a time, Both sad and in a cheerful mood, But never yet in rhyme. To wish thee fairer is no need, More prudent, or more sprightly, Or more ingenious, or more freed From temper-flaws unsightly. What favour then not yet possess'd Can I for thee require, In wedded love already bless'd, To thy whole heart's desire? None here is happy but in part; Full bliss is bliss divine; There dwells some wish in every heart, And doubtless one in thine. That wish, on some fair future day Which Fate shall brightly gild, ('Tis blameless, be it what it may,) I wish it all fulfill'd. PAIRING TIME ANTICIPATED. A FABLE. I shall not ask Jean Jaques Rousseau, If birds confabulate or no; 'Tis clear that they were always able To hold discourse, at least in fable; And e'en the child who knows no better Than to interpret by the letter A story of a cock and bull, Must have a most uncommon skull. It chanced then on a winter's day, But warm and bright and calm as May, The birds, conceiving a design To forestall sweet St. Valentine, In many an orchard, copse, and grove Assembled on affairs of love, And with much twitter and much chatter Began to agitate the matter. At length a Bullfinch, who could boast More years and wisdom than the most, Entreated, opening wide his beak, A moment's liberty to speak; And silence publicly enjoin'd, Delivered briefly thus his mind: My friends! be cautious how ye treat The subject upon which we meet; I fear we shall have winter yet. A Finch, whose tongue knew no control, With golden wing and satin poll, A last year's bird, who ne'er had tried What marriage means, thus pert replied: Methinks the gentleman, quoth she, Opposite in the apple-tree, By his good will would keep us single Till yonder heaven and earth shall mingle; Or (which is likelier to befall) Till death exterminate us all. I marry without more ado; My dear Dick Redcap, what say you? Dick heard, and tweedling, ogling, bridling, Turning short round, strutting, and sideling, Attested, glad, his approbation Of an immediate conjugation. Their sentiments so well express'd Influenced mightily the rest; All pair'd, and each pair built a nest. But though the birds were thus in haste, The leaves came on not quite so fast, And Destiny, that sometimes bears An aspect stern on man's affairs, Not altogether smiled on theirs. The wind, of late breathed gently forth, Now shifted east, and east by north; Bare trees and shrubs but ill, you know, Could shelter them from rain or snow: Stepping into their nests, they paddled, Themselves were chill'd, their eggs were addled; Soon every father bird and mother Grew quarrelsome, and peck'd each other, Parted without the least regret, Except that they had ever met, And learn'd in future to be wiser Than to neglect a good adviser. MORAL. Misses! the tale that I relate This lesson seems to carry— Chuse not alone a proper mate, But proper time to marry. THE DOG AND THE WATER-LILY. NO FABLE. The noon was shady, and soft airs Swept Ouse's silent tide, When, 'scaped from literary cares, I wander'd on his side. My spaniel, prettiest of his race, And high in pedigree, (Two nymphs adorn'd with every grace That spaniel found for me,) Now wanton'd lost in flags and reeds, Now starting into sight, Pursued the swallow o'er the meads With scarce a slower flight. It was the time when Ouse display'd His lilies newly blown; Their beauties I intent survey'd, And one I wished my own. With cane extended far I sought To steer it close to land; But still the prize, though nearly caught, Escaped my eager hand. Beau mark'd my unsuccessful pains With fix'd considerate face, And puzzling set his puppy brains To comprehend the case. But with a cherup clear and strong, Dispersing all his dream, I thence withdrew, and follow'd long The windings of the stream. My ramble ended, I return'd; Beau, trotting far before, The floating wreath again discern'd, And plunging left the shore. I saw him with that lily cropp'd Impatient swim to meet My quick approach, and soon he dropp'd The treasure at my feet. Charm'd with the sight, The world, I cried, Shall hear of this thy deed: My dog shall mortify the pride Of man's superior breed; But chief myself I will enjoin, Awake at duty's call, To show a love as prompt as thine To Him who gives me all. TO THE IMMORTAL MEMORY OF THE HALIBUT, ON WHICH I DINED THIS DAY, MONDAY, APRIL 26, 1784. Where hast thou floated, in what seas pursued Thy pastime? When wast thou an egg new spawn'd, Lost in the immensity of ocean's waste? Roar as they might, the overbearing winds That rock'd the deep, thy cradle, thou wast safe— And in thy minikin and embryo state, Attach'd to the firm leaf of some salt weed, Didst outlive tempests, such as wrung and rack'd The joints of many a stout and gallant bark, And whelm'd them in the unexplored abyss. Indebted to no magnet and no chart, Nor under guidance of the polar fire, Thou wast a voyager on many coasts, Grazing at large in meadows submarine, Where flat Batavia just emerging peeps Above the brine,—where Caledonia's rocks Beat back the surge,—and where Hibernia shoots Her wondrous causeway far into the main. —Wherever thou hast fed, thou little thought'st, And I not more, that I should feed on thee. Peace, therefore, and good health, and much good fish, To him who sent thee! and success, as oft As it descends into the billowy gulf, To the same drag that caught thee!—Fare thee well! Thy lot thy brethren of the slimy fin Would envy, could they know that thou wast doom'd To feed a bard, and to be praised in verse. GRATITUDE. ADDRESSED TO LADY HESKETH. 1786. This cap, that so stately appears, With ribbon-bound tassel on high, Which seems by the crest that it rears Ambitious of brushing the sky; This cap to my Cousin I owe, She gave it, and gave me beside, Wreath'd into an elegant bow, The ribbon with which it is tied. This wheel-footed studying chair, Contrived both for toil and repose, Wide-elbow'd, and wadded with hair, In which I both scribble and doze, Bright-studded to dazzle the eyes, And rival in lustre of that In which, or astronomy lies, Fair Cassiopeïa sat: These carpets, so soft to the foot, Caledonia's traffic and pride, O spare them, ye knights of the boot, Escaped from a cross-country ride! This table and mirror within, Secure from collision and dust, At which I oft shave cheek and chin, And periwig nicely adjust: This moveable structure of shelves, For its beauty admired and its use, And charged with octavos and twelves, The gayest I had to produce; Where, flaming in scarlet and gold, My poems enchanted I view, And hope, in due time, to behold My Iliad and Odyssey too: This china, that decks the alcove, Which here people call a buffet, But what the gods call it above, Has ne'er been reveal'd to us yet: These curtains, that keep the room warm Or cool as the season demands, Those stoves that for pattern and form Seem the labour of Mulciber's hands: All these are not half that I owe To One, from our earliest youth To me ever ready to show Benignity, friendship, and truth; For time, the destroyer declared And foe of our perishing kind, If even her face he has spared, Much less could he alter her mind. Thus compass'd about with the goods And chattels of leisure and ease, I indulge my poetical moods In many such fancies as these; And fancies I fear they will seem— Poets' goods are not often so fine; The poets will swear that I dream, When I sing of the splendour of mine. LINES, COMPOSED FOR A MEMORIAL OF ASHLEY COWPER, ESQ. IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS DEATH. BY HIS NEPHEW WILLIAM OF WESTON. June, 1788. Farewell! endued with all that could engage All hearts to love thee, both in youth and age! In prime of life, for sprightliness enroll'd Among the gay, yet virtuous as the old; In life's last stage, (O blessings rarely found!) Pleasant as youth with all its blossoms crown'd! Through every period of this changeful state Unchanged thyself—wise, good, affectionate! Marble may flatter, and lest this should seem O'ercharged with praises on so dear a theme, Although thy worth be more than half supprest, Love shall be satisfied, and veil the rest. SONG ON PEACE. WRITTEN IN THE SUMMER OF 1783, AT THE REQUEST OF LADY AUSTEN, WHO GAVE THE SENTIMENT. Air—“My fond shepherds of late,” &amp;c. No longer I follow a sound; No longer a dream I pursue; O happiness! not to be found, Unattainable treasure, adieu! I have sought thee in splendour and dress, In the regions of pleasure and taste; I have sought thee, and seem'd to possess, But have proved thee a vision at last. An humble ambition and hope The voice of true wisdom inspires; 'Tis sufficient, if Peace be the scope, And the summit of all our desires. Peace may be the lot of the mind That seeks it in meekness and love; But rapture and bliss are confined To the glorified spirits above. SONG. ALSO WRITTEN AT THE REQUEST OF LADY AUSTEN. [When all within is peace] Air—“The Lass of Pattie's Mill.” When all within is peace, How nature seems to smile! Delights that never cease, The live-long day beguile. From morn to dewy eve, With open hand she showers Fresh blessings to deceive, And soothe the silent hours. It is content of heart Gives nature power to please; The mind that feels no smart Enlivens all it sees, Can make a wintry sky Seem bright as smiling May, And evening's closing eye As peep of early day. The vast majestic globe, So beauteously array'd In nature's various robe, With wondrous skill display'd, Is to a mourner's heart A dreary wild at best; It flutters to depart, And longs to be at rest. EPITAPH ON JOHNSON. January, 1785. Here Johnson lies, a sage by all allow'd, Whom to have bred, may well make England proud; Whose prose was eloquence, by wisdom taught, The graceful vehicle of virtuous thought; Whose verse may claim, grave masculine and strong, Superior praise to the mere poet's song; Who many a noble gift from Heaven possess'd, And faith at last, alone worth all the rest. O man, immortal by a double prize, By fame on earth, by glory in the skies! TO MISS C?, ON HER BIRTHDAY. 1786. How many between east and west, Disgrace their parent earth, Whose deeds constrain us to detest The day that gave them birth! Not so when Stella's natal morn Revolving months restore, We can rejoice that she was born, And wish her born once more! THE FLATTING-MILL. AN ILLUSTRATION. When a bar of pure silver or ingot of gold Is sent to be flatted or wrought into length, It is pass'd between cylinders often, and roll'd In an engine of utmost mechanical strength. Thus tortured and squeezed, at last it appears Like a loose heap of ribbon, a glittering show, Like music it tinkles and rings in your ears, And warm'd by the pressure is all in a glow. This process achieved, it is doom'd to sustain The thump-after-thump of a gold-beater's mallet, And at last is of service in sickness or pain To cover a pill from a delicate palate. Alas for the Poet, who dares undertake To urge reformation of national ill! His head and his heart are both likely to ache With the double employment of mallet and mill. If he wish to instruct, he must learn to delight, Smooth, ductile, and even, his fancy must flow, Must tinkle and glitter like gold to the sight, And catch in its progress a sensible glow. After all he must beat it as thin and as fine As the leaf that enfolds what an invalid swallows, For truth is unwelcome, however divine, And unless you adorn it, a nausea follows. EPITAPH ON A HARE. Here lies, whom hound did ne'er pursue, Nor swifter greyhound follow, Whose foot ne'er tainted morning dew, Nor ear heard huntsman's halloo; Old Tiney, surliest of his kind, Who, nursed with tender care, And to domestic bounds confined, Was still a wild Jack hare. Though duly from my hand he took His pittance every night, He did it with a jealous look, And, when he could, would bite. His diet was of wheaten bread, And milk, and oats, and straw; Thistles, or lettuces instead, With sand to scour his maw. On twigs of hawthorn he regaled, On pippins' russet peel, And, when his juicy salads fail'd, Sliced carrot pleased him well. A Turkey carpet was his lawn, Whereon he loved to bound, To skip and gambol like a fawn, And swing his rump around. His frisking was at evening hours, For then he lost his fear, But most before approaching showers, Or when a storm drew near. Eight years and five round rolling moons He thus saw steal away, Dozing out all his idle noons, And every night at play. I kept him for his humour's sake, For he would oft beguile My heart of thoughts that made it ache, And force me to a smile. But now beneath his walnut shade He finds his long last home, And waits, in snug concealment laid, Till gentler Puss shall come. He, still more aged, feels the shocks From which no care can save, And, partner once of Tiney's box, Must soon partake his grave. END OF VOL. IX.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. X. ON THE LOSS OF THE ROYAL GEORGE. (TO THE MARCH IN SCIPIO.) WRITTEN WHEN THE NEWS ARRIVED. Toll for the brave! The brave that are no more! All sunk beneath the wave, Fast by their native shore! Eight hundred of the brave, Whose courage well was tried, Had made the vessel heel, And laid her on her side; A land breeze shook the shrouds, And she was overset; Down went the Royal George, With all her crew complete. Toll for the brave! Brave Kempenfelt is gone; His last sea-fight is fought; His work of glory done. It was not in the battle; No tempest gave the shock; She sprang no fatal leak; She ran upon no rock: His sword was in its sheath; His fingers held the pen, When Kempenfelt went down, With twice four hundred men. Weigh the vessel up, Once dreaded by our foes! And mingle with our cup The tear that England owes. Her timbers yet are sound, And she may float again, Full-charged with England's thunder, And plough the distant main. But Kempenfelt is gone; His victories are o'er; And he and his eight hundred Shall plough the wave no more. THE NEGRO'S COMPLAINT. Forced from home and all its pleasures, Afric's coast I left forlorn, To increase the stranger's treasures, O'er the raging billows borne. Men from England bought and sold me, Paid my price in paltry gold; But, though slave they have enroll'd me, Minds are never to be sold. Still in thought as free as ever, What are England's rights, I ask, Me from my delights to sever, Me to torture, me to task? Fleecy locks and black complexion Cannot forfeit Nature's claim; Skins may differ, but affection Dwells in white and black the same. Why did all creating Nature Make the plant for which we toil? Sighs must fan it, tears must water, Sweat of ours must dress the soil. Think, ye masters, iron-hearted, Lolling at your jovial boards, Think how many backs have smarted For the sweets your cane affords. Is there, as ye sometimes tell us, Is there One who reigns on high? Has He bid you buy and sell us, Speaking from his throne, the sky? Ask Him, if your knotted scourges, Matches, blood-extorting screws, Are the means that duty urges Agents of his will to use? Hark! He answers!—Wild tornadoes Strewing yonder sea with wrecks, Wasting towns, plantations, meadows, Are the voice with which he speaks. He, foreseeing what vexations Afric's sons should undergo, Fix'd their tyrants' habitations Where his whirlwinds answer—No. By our blood in Afric wasted, Ere our necks received the chain; By the miseries that we tasted, Crossing in your barks the main; By our sufferings, since ye brought us To the man-degrading mart, All sustain'd by patience, taught us Only by a broken heart! Deem our nation brutes no longer, Till some reason ye shall find Worthier of regard and stronger Than the colour of our kind. Slaves of gold, whose sordid dealings Tarnish all your boasted powers, Prove that you have human feelings Ere you proudly question ours! PITY FOR POOR AFRICANS. Video meliora proboque, Deteriora sequor.? I own I am shock'd at the purchase of slaves, And fear those who buy them and sell them are knaves; What I hear of their hardships, their tortures, and groans Is almost enough to draw pity from stones. I pity them greatly, but I must be mum, For how could we do without sugar and rum? Especially sugar, so needful we see; What, give up our desserts, our coffee, and tea! Besides, if we do, the French, Dutch, and Danes, Will heartily thank us, no doubt, for our pains: If we do not buy the poor creatures, they will; And tortures and groans will be multiplied still. If foreigners likewise would give up the trade, Much more in behalf of your wish might be said; But, while they get riches by purchasing blacks, Pray tell me why we may not also go snacks? Your scruples and arguments bring to my mind A story so pat, you may think it is coin'd, On purpose to answer you, out of my mint; But I can assure you I saw it in print. A youngster at school, more sedate than the rest, Had once his integrity put to the test; His comrades had plotted an orchard to rob, And ask'd him to go and assist in the job. He was shock'd, sir, like you, and answer'd—‘Oh, no! What! rob our good neighbour? I pray you don't go! Besides the man's poor, his orchard's his bread: Then think of his children, for they must be fed.” “You speak very fine, and you look very grave, But apples we want, and apples we'll have; If you will go with us, you shall have a share, If not, you shall have neither apple nor pear.” They spoke, and Tom ponder'd—“I see they will go: Poor man! what a pity to injure him so! Poor man! I would save him his fruit if I could, But staying behind will do him no good. “If the matter depended alone upon me, His apples might hang till they dropp'd from the tree; But since they will take them, I think I'll go too; He will lose none by me, though I get a few.” His scruples thus silenced, Tom felt more at ease, And went with his comrades the apples to seize; He blamed and protested, but join'd in the plan; He shared in the plunder, but pitied the man. THE MORNING DREAM. 'Twas in the glad season of spring, Asleep at the dawn of the day, I dream'd what I cannot but sing, So pleasant it seem'd as I lay. I dream'd that, on ocean afloat, Far hence to the westward I sail'd, While the billows high lifted the boat, And the fresh-blowing breeze never fail'd. In the steerage a woman I saw; Such at least was the form that she wore, Whose beauty impress'd me with awe, Ne'er taught me by woman before. She sat, and a shield at her side Shed light, like a sun on the waves, And, smiling divinely, she cried— “I go to make freemen of slaves.” Then raising her voice to a strain The sweetest that ear ever heard, She sung of the slave's broken chain Wherever her glory appear'd. Some clouds, which had over us hung, Fled, chased by her melody clear, And methought while she liberty sung, 'Twas liberty only to hear. Thus swiftly dividing the flood, To a slave-cultured island we came, Where a Demon, her enemy, stood— Oppression his terrible name. In his hand, as the sign of his sway, A scourge hung with lashes he bore, And stood looking out for his prey From Africa's sorrowful shore. But soon as approaching the land That goddess-like woman he view'd, The scourge he let fall from his hand, With blood of his subjects imbrued. I saw him both sicken and die, And the moment the monster expired, Heard shouts that ascended the sky, From thousands with rapture inspired. Awaking, how could I but muse At what such a dream should betide? But soon my ear caught the glad news, Which served my weak thought for a guide,— That Britannia, renown'd o'er the waves For the hatred she ever had shown To the black-sceptred rulers of slaves, Resolves to have none of her own. SWEET MEAT HAS SOUR SAUCE: OR, THE SLAVE-TRADER IN THE DUMPS. A trader I am to the African shore, But since that my trading is like to be o'er, I'll sing you a song that you ne'er heard before, Which nobody can deny, deny, Which nobody can deny. When I first heard the news it gave me a shock, Much like what they call an electrical knock, And now I am going to sell off my stock, Which nobody can deny. 'Tis a curious assortment of dainty regales, To tickle the Negroes with when the ship sails, Fine chains for the neck, and a cat with nine tails, Which nobody can deny. Here's supple-jack plenty, and store of rat-tan, That will wind itself round the sides of a man, As close as a hoop round a bucket or can, Which nobody can deny. Here's padlocks and bolts, and screws for the thumbs, That squeeze them so lovingly till the blood comes; They sweeten the temper like comfits or plums, Which nobody can deny. When a Negro his head from his victuals withdraws, And clenches his teeth and thrusts out his paws, Here's a notable engine to open his jaws, Which nobody can deny. Thus going to market, we kindly prepare A pretty black cargo of African ware, For what they must meet with when they get there, Which nobody can deny. 'Twould do your heart good to see 'em below Lie flat on their backs all the way as we go, Like sprats on a gridiron, scores in a row, Which nobody can deny. But ah! if in vain I have studied an art So gainful to me, all boasting apart, I think it will break my compassionate heart, Which nobody can deny. For oh! how it enters my soul like an awl! This pity, which some people self-pity call, Is sure the most heart-piercing pity of all, Which nobody can deny. So this is my song, as I told you before; Come, buy off my stock, for I must no more Carry Cæsars and Pompeys to Sugar-cane shore, Which nobody can deny, deny, Which nobody can deny. THE VALEDICTION. Farewell, false hearts! whose best affections fail, Like shallow brooks which summer suns exhale; Forgetful of the man whom once ye chose, Cold in his cause, and careless of his woes; I bid you both a long and last adieu! Cold in my turn, and unconcern'd like you. First, farewell Niger! whom, now duly proved, I disregard as much as I have loved. Your brain well furnished, and your tongue well taught To press with energy your ardent thought, Your senatorial dignity of face, Sound sense, intrepid spirit, manly grace, Have raised you high as talents can ascend, Made you a peer, but spoilt you for a friend! Pretend to all that parts have e'er acquired; Be great, be fear'd, be envied, be admired; To fame as lasting as the earth pretend, But not hereafter to the name of friend! I sent you verse, and, as your lordship knows, Back'd with a modest sheet of humble prose, Not to recall a promise to your mind, Fulfill'd with ease had you been so inclined, But to comply with feelings, and to give Proof of an old affection still alive. Your sullen silence serves at least to tell Your alter'd heart; and so, my lord, farewell! Next, busy actor on a meaner stage, Amusement-monger of a trifling age, Illustrious histrionic patentee, Terentius, once my friend, farewell to thee! In thee some virtuous qualities combine, To fit thee for a nobler post than thine, Who, born a gentleman, hast stoop'd too low, To live by buskin, sock and raree-show. Thy schoolfellow, and partner of thy plays, When Nichol swung the birch and twined the bays, And having known thee bearded and full grown, The weekly censor of a laughing town, I thought the volume I presumed to send, Graced with the name of a long-absent friend, Might prove a welcome gift, and touch thine heart, Not hard by nature, in a feeling part. But thou it seems, (what cannot grandeur do, Though but a dream?) art grown disdainful too; And strutting in thy school of queens and kings, Who fret their hour and are forgotten things, Hast caught the cold distemper of the day, And, like his lordship, cast thy friend away. Oh Friendship! cordial of the human breast! So little felt, so fervently profess'd! Thy blossoms deck our unsuspecting years; The promise of delicious fruit appears: We hug the hopes of constancy and truth, Such is the folly of our dreaming youth; But soon, alas! detect the rash mistake, That sanguine inexperience loves to make; And view with tears the expected harvest lost, Decay'd by time, or wither'd by a frost. Whoever undertakes a friend's great part Should be renew'd in nature, pure in heart, Prepared for martyrdom, and strong to prove A thousand ways the force of genuine love. He may be call'd to give up health and gain, To exchange content for trouble, ease for pain, To echo sigh for sigh, and groan for groan, And wet his cheeks with sorrows not his own. The heart of man, for such a task too frail, When most relied on, is most sure to fail; And, summon'd to partake its fellow's woe, Starts from its office, like a broken bow. Votaries of business and of pleasure, prove Faithless alike in friendship and in love. Retired from all the circles of the gay, And all the crowds that bustle life away, To scenes where competition, envy, strife, Beget no thunder-clouds to trouble life, Let me, the charge of some good angel, find One who has known and has escaped mankind; Polite, yet virtuous, who has brought away The manners, not the morals, of the day: With him, perhaps with her, (for men have known No firmer friendships than the fair have shown,) Let me enjoy, in some unthought-of spot, (All former friends forgiven, and forgot,) Down to the close of life's fast fading scene, Union of hearts, without a flaw between. 'Tis grace, 'tis bounty, and it calls for praise, If God give health, that sunshine of our days; And if he add, a blessing shared by few, Content of heart, more praises still are due:— But if he grant a friend, that boon possess'd Indeed is treasure, and crowns all the rest; And giving one, whose heart is in the skies, Born from above, and made divinely wise, He gives, what bankrupt nature never can, Whose noblest coin is light and brittle man, Gold, purer far than Ophir ever knew, A soul, an image of himself, and therefore true. ON THE QUEEN'S VISIT TO LONDON, THE NIGHT OF THE 17TH MARCH, 1789. When, long sequester'd from his throne, George took his seat again, By right of worth, not blood alone, Entitled here to reign; Then, Loyalty, with all his lamps New trimm'd, a gallant show, Chasing the darkness and the damps, Set London in a glow. 'Twas hard to tell of streets or squares, Which form'd the chief display, These most resembling cluster'd stars, Those the long milky way. Bright shone the roofs, the domes, the spires, And rockets flew, self-driven, To hang their momentary fires Amid the vault of Heaven. So, fire with water to compare, The ocean serves on high Up-spouted by a whale in air, To express unwieldy joy. Had all the pageants of the world In one procession join'd, And all the banners been unfurl'd That heralds e'er design'd; For no such sight had England's Queen Forsaken her retreat, Where, George recover'd made a scene Sweet always, doubly sweet. Yet glad she came that night to prove, A witness undescried, How much the object of her love Was loved by all beside. Darkness the skies had mantled o'er In aid of her design,— Darkness, O Queen! ne'er call'd before To veil a deed of thine. On borrow'd wheels away she flies, Resolved to be unknown, And gratify no curious eyes That night, except her own. Arrived, a night like noon she sees, And hears the million hum; As all by instinct, like the bees, Had known their sovereign come. Pleased she beheld aloft pourtray'd On many a splendid wall, Emblems of health, and heavenly aid, And George the theme of all. Unlike the enigmatic line, So difficult to spell, Which shook Belshazzar at his wine, The night his city fell. Soon, watery grew her eyes and dim, But with a joyful tear, None else, except in prayer for him, George ever drew from her. It was a scene in every part Like those in fable feign'd, And seem'd by some magician's art Created and sustain'd. But other magic there, she knew, Had been exerted none, To raise such wonders in her view, Save love of George alone. That cordial thought her spirits cheer'd, And through the cumberous throng, Not else unworthy to be fear'd, Convey'd her calm along. So, ancient poets say, serene The sea-maid rides the waves, And fearless of the billowy scene Her peaceful bosom laves. With more than astronomic eyes She view'd the sparkling show; One Georgian star adorns the skies, She myriads found below. Yet let the glories of a night Like that, once seen, suffice; Heaven grant us no such future sight, Such previous woe the price! ANNUS MEMORABILIS. 1789. WRITTEN IN COMMEMORATION OF HIS MAJESTY'S HAPPY RECOVERY. I ransack'd, for a theme of song, Much ancient chronicle, and long; I read of bright embattled fields, Of trophied helmets, spears, and shields, Of chiefs, whose single arm could boast Prowess to dissipate a host; Through tomes of fable and of dream I sought an eligible theme, But none I found, or found them shared Already by some happier bard. To modern times, with truth to guide My busy search, I next applied; Here cities won and fleets dispersed Urged loud a claim to be rehearsed, Deeds of unperishing renown, Our fathers' triumphs and our own. Thus as the bee, from bank to bower, Assiduous sips at every flower, But rests on none till that be found Where most nectareous sweets abound, So I, from theme to theme display'd In many a page historic stray'd, Siege after siege, fight after fight, Contemplating with small delight, (For feats of sanguinary hue Not always glitter in my view,) Till, settling on the current year, I found the far sought treasure near. A theme for poetry divine, A theme to ennoble even mine, In memorable Eighty-nine. The spring of eighty-nine shall be An æra cherish'd long by me, Which joyful I will oft record, And thankful at my frugal board; For then the clouds of eighty-eight, That threaten'd England's trembling state With loss of what she least could spare, Her sovereign's tutelary care, One breath of Heaven, that cried—Restore! Chased, never to assemble more: And far the richest crown on earth, If valued by its wearer's worth, The symbol of a righteous reign Sat fast on George's brows again. Then peace and joy again possess'd Our Queen's long-agitated breast; Such joy and peace as can be known By sufferers like herself alone, Who losing, or supposing lost, The good on earth they valued most, For that dear sorrow's sake forego All hope of happiness below, Then suddenly regain the prize, And flash thanksgivings to the skies! O, Queen of Albion, queen of isles! Since all thy tears were changed to smiles, The eyes, that never saw thee, shine With joy not unallied to thine, Transports not chargeable with art Illume the land's remotest part, And strangers to the air of courts, Both in their toils and at their sports, The happiness of answer'd prayers, That gilds thy features, show in theirs. If they who on thy state attend, Awe-struck, before thy presence bend, 'Tis but the natural effect Of grandeur that ensures respect; But she is something more than Queen Who is beloved where never seen. THE COCK-FIGHTER'S GARLAND. May, 1789. Muse—hide his name of whom I sing, Lest his surving House thou bring For his sake into scorn, Nor speak the School from which he drew The much or little that he knew, Nor Place where he was born. That such a man once was, may seem Worthy of record, (if the theme Perchance may credit win,) For proof to man, what Man may prove, If Grace depart, and Demons move The source of guilt within. This man (for since the howling wild Disclaims him, Man he must be styled) Wanted no good below; Gentle he was, if gentle birth Could make him such; and he had worth, If wealth can worth bestow. In social talk and ready jest He shone superior at the feast, And qualities of mind Illustrious in the eyes of those Whose gay society he chose Possess'd of every kind. Methinks I see him powder'd red, With bushy locks his well-dress'd head Wing'd broad on either side, The mossy rose-bud not so sweet; His steeds superb, his carriage neat As luxury could provide. Can such be cruel? Such can be Cruel as hell, and so was he; A tyrant entertain'd With barbarous sports, whose fell delight Was to encourage mortal fight 'Twixt birds to battle train'd. One feather'd champion he possess'd, His darling far beyond the rest, Which never knew disgrace, Nor e'er had fought, but he made flow The life-blood of his fiercest foe, The Cæsar of his race. It chanced, at last, when, on a day, He push'd him to the desperate fray, His courage droop'd, he fled. The Master storm'd, the prize was lost, And, instant, frantic at the cost, He doom'd his favourite dead. He seized him fast, and from the pit Flew to the kitchen, snatch'd the spit, And, bring me cord, he cried; The cord was brought, and, at his word, To that dire implement the bird Alive and struggling, tied. The horrid sequel asks a veil, And all the terrors of the tale That can be, shall be, sunk.— Led by the sufferer's screams aright His shock'd companions view the sight And him with fury drunk. All, suppliant, beg a milder fate For the old warrior at the grate: He, deaf to pity's call, Whirl'd round him rapid as a wheel His culinary club of steel, Death menacing on all. But vengeance hung not far remote, For while he stretch'd his clamorous throat And heaven and earth defied, Big with a curse too closely pent That struggled vainly for a vent, He totter'd, reel'd, and died. 'Tis not for us, with rash surmise, To point the judgements of the skies; But judgements plain as this, That, sent for Man's instruction, bring A written label on their wing, 'Tis hard to read amiss. ON THE BENEFIT RECEIVED BY HIS MAJESTY FROM SEA-BATHING, IN THE YEAR 1789. O Sovereign of an isle renown'd For undisputed sway Wherever o'er yon gulf profound Her navies wing their way; With juster claim she builds at length Her empire on the sea, And well may boast the waves her strength Which strength restored to Thee. TO MRS. THROCKMORTON, ON HER BEAUTIFUL TRANSCRIPT OF HORACE'S ODE AD LIBRUM SUUM. February, 1790. Maria, could Horace have guess'd What honour awaited his ode To his own little volume address'd, The honour which you have bestow'd,— Who have traced it in characters here, So elegant, even, and neat, He had laugh'd at the critical sneer Which he seems to have trembled to meet. And sneer, if you please, he had said, A nymph shall hereafter arise Who shall give me, when you are all dead, The glory your malice denies; Shall dignity give to my lay, Although but a mere bagatelle; And even a poet shall say, Nothing ever was written so well. INSCRIPTION FOR A STONE ERECTED AT THE SOWING OF A GROVE OF OAKS AT CHILLINGTON, THE SEAT OF T. GIFFARD, ESQ. 1790. June, 1790. Other stones the era tell, When some feeble mortal fell; I stand here to date the birth Of these hardy sons of Earth. Which shall longest brave the sky, Storm and frost—these Oaks or I? Pass an age or two away, I must moulder and decay; But the years that crumble me Shall invigorate the tree, Spread its branch, dilate its size, Lift its summit to the skies. Cherish honour, virtue, truth, So shalt thou prolong thy youth. Wanting these, however fast Man be fix'd, and form'd to last, He is lifeless even now, Stone at heart, and cannot grow. ANOTHER, FOR A STONE ERECTED ON A SIMILAR OCCASION AT THE SAME PLACE IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR. June, 1790. Reader! Behold a monument That asks no sigh or tear, Though it perpetuate the event Of a great burial here. Anno 1791. HYMN FOR THE USE OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOL AT OLNEY. July, 1790. Hear, Lord, the song of praise and prayer, In heaven thy dwelling-place, From infants, made the public care, And taught to seek thy face! Thanks for thy Word and for thy Day; And grant us, we implore, Never to waste in sinful play Thy holy Sabbaths more. Thanks that we hear,—but oh! impart To each desires sincere, That we may listen with our heart, And learn as well as hear. For if vain thoughts the minds engage Of elder far than we, What hope that at our heedless age Our minds should e'er be free? Much hope, if thou our spirits take Under thy gracious sway, Who canst the wisest wiser make, And babes as wise as they. Wisdom and bliss thy word bestows, A sun that ne'er declines; And be thy mercies shower'd on those Who placed us where it shines. STANZAS ON THE LATE INDECENT LIBERTIES TAKEN WITH THE REMAINS OF THE GREAT MILTON,—ANNO 1790. August, 1790. “Me too, perchance, in future days, The sculptured stone shall show, With Paphian myrtle or with bays Parnassian on my brow. “But I, or ere that season come, Escaped from every care, Shall reach my refuge in the tomb, And sleep securely there.” So sang, in Roman tone and style, The youthful bard, ere long Ordain'd to grace his native isle With her sublimest song. Who then but must conceive disdain, Hearing the deed unblest Of wretches who have dared profane His dread sepulchral rest? Ill fare the hands that heaved the stones Where Milton's ashes lay, That trembled not to grasp his bones And steal his dust away! O ill-requited bard! neglect Thy living worth repaid, And blind idolatrous respect As much affronts thee dead. TO MRS. KING, ON HER KIND PRESENT TO THE AUTHOR, A PATCHWORK COUNTERPANE OF HER OWN MAKING. August 14, 1790. The Bard, if e'er he feel at all, Must sure be quicken'd by a call Both on his heart and head, To pay with tuneful thanks the care And kindness of a lady fair Who deigns to deck his bed. A bed like this, in ancient time, On Ida's barren top sublime, (As Homer's Epic shows,) Composed of sweetest vernal flowers, Without the aid of sun or showers, For Jove and Juno rose. Less beautiful, however gay, Is that which in the scorching day Receives the weary swain Who, laying his long scythe aside, Sleeps on some bank with daisies pied, Till roused to toil again. What labours of the loom I see! Looms numberless have groan'd for me! Should every maiden come To scramble for the patch that bears The impress of the robe she wears, The bell would toll for some. And oh, what havoc would ensue! This bright display of every hue All in a moment fled! As if a storm should strip the bowers Of all their tendrils, leaves, and flowers,— Each pocketing a shred. Thanks, then, to every gentle Fair, Who will not come to peck me bare As bird of borrow'd feather, And thanks to one, above them all, The gentle Fair of Pertenhall, Who put the whole together. IN MEMORY OF THE LATE JOHN THORNTON, ESQ. November, 1790. Poets attempt the noblest task they can, Praising the Author of all good in man, And, next, commemorating Worthies lost, The dead in whom that good abounded most. Thee, therefore, of commercial fame, but more Famed for thy probity from shore to shore; Thee, Thornton! worthy in some page to shine, As honest and more eloquent than mine, I mourn; or, since thrice happy thou must be, The world, no longer thy abode, not thee. Thee to deplore were grief mispent indeed; It were to weep that goodness has its meed, That there is bliss prepared in yonder sky, And glory for the virtuous, when they die. What pleasure can the miser's fondled hoard, Or spendthrift's prodigal excess afford, Sweet as the privilege of healing woe By virtue suffer'd combating below? That privilege was thine; Heaven gave thee means To illumine with delight the saddest scenes, Till thy appearance chased the gloom, forlorn As midnight, and despairing of a morn. Thou hadst an industry in doing good, Restless as his who toils and sweats for food; Avarice, in thee, was the desire of wealth By rust unperishable or by stealth; And if the genuine worth of gold depend On application to its noblest end, Thine had a value in the scales of Heaven, Surpassing all that mine or mint had given. And, though God made thee of a nature prone To distribution boundless of thy own, And still by motives of religious force Impell'd thee more to that heroic course, Yet was thy liberality discreet, Nice in its choice, and of a temper'd heat, And though in act unwearied, secret still, As in some solitude the summer rill Refreshes, where it winds, the faded green, And cheers the drooping flowers, unheard, unseen. Such was thy charity; no sudden start, After long sleep, of passion in the heart, But steadfast principle, and, in its kind, Of close relation to the eternal mind, Traced easily to its true source above, To Him, whose works bespeak his nature, Love. Thy bounties all were Christian, and I make This record of thee for the Gospel's sake; That the incredulous themselves may see Its use and power exemplified in thee. TO WARREN HASTINGS, ESQ. BY AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW OF HIS AT WESTMINSTER. Hastings! I knew thee young, and of a mind While young humane, conversable, and kind; Nor can I well believe thee, gentle then, Now grown a villain, and the worst of men. But rather some suspect, who have oppress'd And worried thee, as not themselves the best. THE FOUR AGES. A BRIEF FRAGMENT OF AN EXTENSIVE PROJECTED POEM. May, 1791. “I could be well content, allow'd the use Of past experience, and the wisdom glean'd From worn-out follies, now acknowledged such, To recommence life's trial, in the hope Of fewer errors, on a second proof!” Thus while grey evening lull'd the wind, and call'd Fresh odours from the shrubbery at my side, Taking my lonely winding walk, I mused, And held accustom'd conference with my heart; When from within it thus a voice replied: “Couldst thou in truth? and art thou taught at length This wisdom, and but this, from all the past? Is not the pardon of thy long arrear, Time wasted, violated laws, abuse Of talents, judgements, mercies, better far Than opportunity vouchsafed to err With less excuse, and haply, worse effect?” I heard, and acquiesced: then to and fro Oft pacing, as the mariner his deck, My gravelly bounds, from self to human kind I pass'd, and next consider'd, what is man? Knows he his origin? can he ascend By reminiscence to his earliest date? Slept he in Adam? and in those from him Through numerous generations, till he found At length his destined moment to be born? Or was he not, till fashion'd in the womb? Deep mysteries both! which schoolmen must have toil'd To unriddle, and have left them mysteries still. It is an evil incident to man, And of the worst, that unexplored he leaves Truths useful and attainable with ease, To search forbidden deeps, where mystery lies Not to be solved, and useless, if it might. Mysteries are food for angels; they digest With ease, and find them nutriment; but man, While yet he dwells below, must stoop to glean His manna from the ground, or starve, and die. THE JUDGEMENT OF THE POETS. May, 1791. Two nymphs, both nearly of an age, Of numerous charms possess'd, A warm dispute once chanced to wage, Whose temper was the best. The worth of each had been complete, Had both alike been mild; But one, although her smile was sweet, Frown'd oftener than she smiled. And in her humour, when she frown'd, Would raise her voice and roar, And shake with fury to the ground The garland that she wore. The other was of gentler cast, From all such frenzy clear, Her frowns were seldom known to last, And never proved severe. To poets of renown in song The nymphs referr'd the cause, Who, strange to tell, all judged it wrong, And gave misplaced applause. They gentle call'd, and kind and soft, The flippant and the scold, And though she changed her mood so oft, That failing left untold. No judges, sure, were e'er so mad, Or so resolved to err,— In short, the charms her sister had They lavish'd all on her. Then thus the God whom fondly they Their great Inspirer call, Was heard, one genial summer's day, To reprimand them all. “Since thus ye have combined,” he said, “My favourite nymph to slight, Adorning May, that peevish maid, With June's undoubted right, “The Minx shall, for your folly's sake, Still prove herself a shrew, Shall make your scribbling fingers ache, And pinch your noses blue.” THE MORALIZER CORRECTED. A TALE. A hermit, (or if 'chance you hold That title now too trite and old), A man, once young, who lived retired As hermit could have well desired, His hours of study closed at last, And finish'd his concise repast, Stoppled his cruise, replaced his book Within its customary nook, And, staff in hand, set forth to share The sober cordial of sweet air, Like Isaac, with a mind applied To serious thought at eveningtide. Autumnal rains had made it chill, And from the trees, that fringed his hill, Shades slanting at the close of day Chill'd more his else delightful way; Distant a little mile he spied A western bank's still sunny side, And right toward the favour'd place Proceeding with his nimblest pace, In hope to bask a little yet, Just reach'd it when the sun was set. Your hermit, young and jovial sirs! Learns something from whate'er occurs;— And hence, he said, my mind computes The real worth of man's pursuits. His object chosen, wealth or fame, Or other sublunary game, Imagination to his view Presents it deck'd with every hue, That can seduce him not to spare His powers of best exertion there, But youth, health, vigour to expend On so desirable an end. Ere long approach lifes evening shades, The glow that fancy gave it fades; And, earn'd too late, it wants the grace That first engaged him in the chase. True, answer'd an angelic guide, Attendant at the senior's side,— But whether all the time it cost, To urge the fruitless chase be lost, Must be decided by the worth Of that which call'd his ardour forth. Trifles pursued, whate'er the event, Must cause him shame or discontent; A vicious object still is worse, Successful there he wins a curse; But he, whom e'en in life's last stage Endeavours laudable engage, Is paid at least in peace of mind, And sense of having well design'd; And if, ere he attain his end, His sun precipitate descend, A brighter prize than that he meant Shall recompense his mere intent. No virtuous wish can bear a date Either too early or too late. THE FAITHFUL BIRD. The greenhouse is my summer seat; My shrubs displaced from that retreat Enjoy'd the open air; Two goldfinches, whose sprightly song Had been their mutual solace long, Lived happy prisoners there. They sang as blithe as finches sing That flutter loose on golden wing, And frolic where they list; Strangers to liberty, 'tis true, But that delight they never knew, And therefore never miss'd. But nature works in every breast, With force not easily suppress'd; And Dick felt some desires, That, after many an effort vain, Instructed him at length to gain A pass between his wires. The open windows seem'd to invite The freeman to a farewell flight; But Tom was still confined; And Dick, although his way was clear, Was much too generous and sincere To leave his friend behind. So settling on his cage, by play, And chirp, and kiss, he seem'd to say, You must not live alone;— Nor would he quit that chosen stand Till I, with slow and cautious hand, Return'd him to his own. Oh ye, who never taste the joys Of friendship, satisfied with noise, Fandango, ball, and rout! Blush when I tell you how a bird A prison with a friend preferr'd To liberty without. THE NEEDLESS ALARM. A TALE. There is a field, through which I often pass, Thick overspread with moss and silky grass, Adjoining close to Kilwick's echoing wood, Where oft the bitch fox hides her hapless brood, Reserved to solace many a neighbouring squire, That he may follow them through brake and brier, Contusion hazarding of neck or spine, Which rural gentlemen call sport divine. A narrow brook, by rushy banks conceal'd, Runs in a bottom, and divides the field; Oaks intersperse it, that had once a head, But now wear crests of oven wood instead; And where the land slopes to its watery bourn Wide yawns a gulf beside a ragged thorn; Bricks line the sides, but shiver'd long ago, And horrid brambles intertwine below; A hollow scoop'd, I judge, in ancient time, For baking earth, or burning rock to lime. Not yet the hawthorn bore her berries red, With which the fieldfare, wintry guest, is fed; Nor Autumn yet had brush'd from every spray, With her chill hand, the mellow leaves away; But corn was housed, and beans were in the stack; Now therefore issued forth the spotted pack, With tails high mounted, ears hung low, and throats With a whole gamut fill'd of heavenly notes, For which, alas! my destiny severe, Though ears she gave me two, gave me no ear. The sun, accomplishing his early march, His lamp now planted on heaven's topmost arch, When, exercise and air my only aim, And heedless whither, to that field I came, Ere yet with ruthless joy the happy hound Told hill and dale that Reynard's track was found, Or with the high raised horn's melodious clang All Kilwick and all Dinglederry rang. Sheep grazed the field; some with soft bosom press'd The herb as soft, while nibbling stray'd the rest; Nor noise was heard but of the hasty brook, Struggling, detain'd in many a petty nook. All seem'd so peaceful, that, from them convey'd, To me their peace by kind contagion spread. But when the huntsman, with distended cheek, 'Gan make his instrument of music speak, And from within the wood that crash was heard, Though not a hound from whom it burst appear'd, The sheep recumbent and the sheep that grazed, All huddling into phalanx, stood and gazed, Admiring, terrified, the novel strain, Then coursed the field around, and coursed it round again; But recollecting, with a sudden thought, That flight in circles urged advanced them nought, They gather'd close around the old pit's brink, And thought again—but knew not what to think. The man to solitude accustom'd long, Perceives in every thing that lives a tongue; Not animals alone, but shrubs and trees Have speech for him, and understood with ease; After long drought, when rains abundant fall, He hears the herbs and flowers rejoicing all; Knows what the freshness of their hue implies, How glad they catch the largess of the skies; But, with precision nicer still, the mind He scans of every locomotive kind; Birds of all feather, beasts of every name, That serve mankind, or shun them, wild or tame; The looks and gestures of their griefs and fears Have all articulation in his ears; He spells them true by intuition's light, And needs no glossary to set him right. This truth premised was needful as a text, To win due credence to what follows next. Awhile they mused; surveying every face, Thou hadst supposed them of superior race; Their periwigs of wool and fears combined, Stamp'd on each countenance such marks of mind, That sage they seem'd, as lawyers o'er a doubt, Which, puzzling long, at last they puzzle out; Or academic tutors, teaching youths, Sure ne'er to want them, mathematic truths; When thus a mutton statelier than the rest, A ram, the ewes and wethers sad address'd: Friends! we have lived too long. I never heard Sounds such as these, so worthy to be fear'd. Could I believe, that winds for ages pent In earth's dark womb have found at last a vent, And from their prisonhouse below arise, With all these hideous howlings to the skies, I could be much composed, nor should appear, For such a cause, to feel the slightest fear. Yourselves have seen what time the thunders roll'd All night, me resting quiet in the fold. Or heard we that tremendous bray alone, I could expound the melancholy tone; Should deem it by our old companion made, The ass; for he, we know, has lately stray'd, And being lost, perhaps, and wandering wide, Might be supposed to clamour for a guide. But ah! those dreadful yells what soul can hear, That owns a carcass, and not quake for fear? Demons produce them doubtless, brazen-claw'd, And fang'd with brass, the Demons are abroad; I hold it therefore wisest and most fit That, life to save, we leap into the pit. Him answer'd then his loving mate and true, But more discreet than he, a Cambrian ewe. How? leap into the pit our life to save? To save our life leap all into the grave? For can we find it less? Contemplate first The depth how aweful! falling there, we burst: Or should the brambles interposed our fall In part abate, that happiness were small; For with a race like theirs no chance I see Of peace or ease to creatures clad as we. Meantime, noise kills not. Be it Dapple's bray, Or be it not, or be it whose it may, And rush those other sounds, that seem by tongues Of demons utter'd, from whatever lungs, Sounds are but sounds, and, till the cause appear, We have at least commodious standing here. Come fiend, come fury, giant, monster, blast From earth or hell, we can but plunge at last. While thus she spake, I fainter heard the peals, For Reynard, close attended at his heels By panting dog, tired man, and spatter'd horse, Through mere good fortune, took a different course. The flock grew calm again, and I, the road Following, that led me to my own abode, Much wonder'd that the silly sheep had found Such cause of terror in an empty sound, So sweet to huntsman, gentleman, and hound. MORAL. Beware of desperate steps. The darkest day, Live till to-morrow, will have pass'd away. INSCRIPTION FOR THE TOMB OF MR. HAMILTON. Pause here, and think; a monitory rhyme Demands one moment of thy fleeting time. Consult life's silent clock, thy bounding vein; Seems it to say—“Health here has long to reign?” Hast thou the vigour of thy youth? an eye That beams delight? a heart untaught to sigh? Yet fear! Youth ofttimes healthful and at ease, Anticipates a day it never sees; And many a tomb, like Hamilton's, aloud Exclaims “Prepare thee for an early shroud!” EPITAPH ON MRS. M. HIGGINS, OF WESTON. 1791. Laurels may flourish round the conqueror's tomb, But happiest they who win the world to come: Believers have a silent field to fight, And their exploits are veil'd from human sight. They in some nook, where little known they dwell, Kneel, pray in faith, and rout the hosts of hell; Eternal triumphs crown their toils divine, And all those triumphs, Mary, now are thine. THE RETIRED CAT. 1791. A poet's Cat, sedate and grave As poet well could wish to have, Was much addicted to inquire For nooks to which she might retire, And where, secure as mouse in chink, She might repose, or sit and think. I know not where she caught the trick,— Nature perhaps herself had cast her In such a mould philosophique, Or else she learn'd it of her Master. Sometimes ascending, debonnair, An apple-tree, or lofty pear, Lodged with convenience in the fork, She watch'd the gardener at his work; Sometimes her ease and solace sought In an old empty watering-pot, There wanting nothing, save a fan, To seem some nymph in her sedan Apparell'd in exactest sort, And ready to be borne to court. But love of change it seems has place Not only in our wiser race, Cats also feel, as well as we, That passion's force, and so did she. Her climbing, she began to find, Exposed her too much to the wind, And the old utensil of tin Was cold and comfortless within: She therefore wish'd instead of those Some place of more serene repose, Where neither cold might come, nor air Too rudely wanton with her hair, And sought it in the likeliest mode Within her master's snug abode. A drawer, it chanced, at bottom lined With linen of the softest kind, With such as merchants introduce From India, for the ladies' use, A drawer impending o'er the rest, Half open in the topmost chest, Of depth enough, and none to spare, Invited her to slumber there; Puss with delight beyond expression Survey'd the scene and took possession. Recumbent at her ease ere long, And lull'd by her own humdrum song, She left the cares of life behind, And slept as she would sleep her last, When in came, housewifely inclined, The chambermaid, and shut it fast, By no malignity impell'd, But all unconscious whom it held. Awaken'd by the shock, cried Puss, “Was ever cat attended thus! The open drawer was left, I see, Merely to prove a nest for me, For soon as I was well composed Then came the maid, and it was closed. How smooth these 'kerchiefs and how sweet! Oh what a delicate retreat! I will resign myself to rest Till Sol declining in the west Shall call to supper, when, no doubt, Susan will come and let me out.” The evening came, the sun descended, And puss remain'd still unattended. The night roll'd tardily away, (With her indeed 'twas never day;) The sprightly morn her course renew'd, The evening grey again ensued, And puss came into mind no more Than if entomb'd the day before. With hunger pinch'd, and pinch'd for room, She now presaged approaching doom, Nor slept a single wink or purr'd, Conscious of jeopardy incurr'd. That night, by chance, the poet watching, Heard an inexplicable scratching; His noble heart went pit-a-pat, And to himself he said—“What's that?” He drew the curtain at his side, And forth he peep'd, but nothing spied; Yet, by his ear directed, guess'd Something imprison'd in the chest, And, doubtful what, with prudent care Resolved it should continue there. At length, a voice which well he knew, A long and melancholy mew, Saluting his poetic ears, Consoled him, and dispell'd his fears; He left his bed, he trod the floor, He 'gan in haste the drawers explore, The lowest first, and without stop The rest in order to the top; For 'tis a truth well known to most, That whatsoever thing is lost, We seek it, ere it come to light, In every cranny but the right. Forth skipp'd the cat, not now replete As erst with airy self-conceit, Nor in her own fond apprehension A theme for all the world's attention, But modest, sober, cured of all Her notions hyperbolical, And wishing for a place of rest Any thing rather than a chest. Then stepp'd the poet into bed With this reflection in his head: MORAL. Beware of too sublime a sense Of your own worth and consequence. The man who dreams himself so great, And his importance of such weight, That all around in all that's done Must move and act for Him alone, Will learn in school of tribulation The folly of his expectation. YARDLEY OAK. 1791. Survivor sole, and hardly such, of all That once lived here, thy brethren, at my birth, (Since which I number threescore winters past,) A shatter'd veteran, hollow-trunk'd perhaps, As now, and with excoriate forks deform, Relics of ages! Could a mind, imbued With truth from Heaven, created thing adore, I might with reverence kneel, and worship thee. It seems idolatry, with some excuse, When our forefather Druids in their oaks Imagined sanctity. The conscience, yet Unpurified by an authentic act Of amnesty, the meed of blood divine, Loved not the light, but, gloomy, into gloom Of thickest shades, like Adam after taste Of fruit proscribed, as to a refuge, fled. Thou wast a bauble once; a cup and ball, Which babes might play with; and the thievish jay, Seeking her food, with ease might have purloin'd The auburn nut that held thee, swallowing down Thy yet close-folded latitude of boughs And all thine embryo vastness at a gulp. But Fate thy growth decreed; autumnal rains Beneath thy parent tree mellow'd the soil Design'd thy cradle; and a skipping deer, With pointed hoof dibbling the glebe, prepared The soft receptacle, in which, secure, Thy rudiments should sleep the winter through. So Fancy dreams. Disprove it, if ye can, Ye reasoners broad awake, whose busy search Of argument, employ'd too oft amiss, Sifts half the pleasures of short life away! Thou fell'st mature; and in the loamy clod Swelling with vegetative force instinct Didst burst thine egg, as theirs the fabled Twins, Now stars; two lobes, protruding, pair'd exact; A leaf succeeded, and another leaf, And, all the elements thy puny growth Fostering propitious, thou becamest a twig. Who lived when thou wast such? Oh, couldst thou speak, As in Dodona once thy kindred trees Oracular, I would not curious ask The future, best unknown, but at thy mouth Inquisitive, the less ambiguous past. By thee I might correct, erroneous oft, The clock of history, facts and events Timing more punctual, unrecorded facts Recovering, and misstated setting right— Desperate attempt, till trees shall speak again! Time made thee what thou wast, king of the woods; And Time hath made thee what thou art—a cave For owls to roost in. Once thy spreading boughs O'erhung the champaign; and the numerous flocks, That grazed it, stood beneath that ample cope Uncrowded, yet safe-shelter'd from the storm. No flock frequents thee now. Thou hast outlived Thy popularity, and art become (Unless verse rescue thee awhile) a thing Forgotten, as the foliage of thy youth. While thus through all the stages thou hast push'd Of treeship—first a seedling, hid in grass; Then twig; then sapling; and, as century roll'd. Slow after century, a giant-bulk Of girth enormous, with moss-cushion'd root Upheaved above the soil, and sides emboss'd With prominent wens globose,—till at the last The rottenness, which time is charged to inflict On other mighty ones, found also thee. What exhibitions various hath the world Witness'd of mutability in all That we account most durable below! Change is the diet, on which all subsist, Created changeable, and change at last Destroys them. Skies uncertain now the heat Transmitting cloudless, and the solar beam Now quenching in a boundless sea of clouds,— Calm and alternate storm, moisture and drought, Invigorate by turns the springs of life In all that live, plant, animal, and man, And in conclusion mar them. Nature's threads, Fine passing thought, e'en in her coarsest works, Delight in agitation, yet sustain, The force, that agitates, not unimpair'd; But, worn by frequent impulse, to the cause Of their best tone their dissolution owe. Thought cannot spend itself, comparing still The great and little of thy lot, thy growth From almost nullity into a state Of matchless grandeur, and declension thence, Slow, into such magnificent decay. Time was, when, settling on thy leaf, a fly Could shake thee to the root—and time has been When tempests could not. At thy firmest age Thou hadst within thy bole solid contents, That might have ribb'd the sides and plank'd the deck Of some flagg'd admiral; and tortuous arms, The shipwright's darling treasure, didst present To the four-quarter'd winds, robust and bold, Warp'd into tough knee-timber, many a load! But the axe spared thee. In those thriftier days Oaks fell not, hewn by thousands, to supply The bottomless demands of contest, waged For senatorial honours. Thus to Time The task was left to whittle thee away With his sly scythe, whose ever-nibbling edge, Noiseless, an atom and an atom more Disjoining from the rest, has, unobserved, Achieved a labour, which had far and wide, By man perform'd, made all the forest ring. Embowell'd now, and of thy ancient self Possessing nought but the scoop'd rind, that seems An huge throat, calling to the clouds for drink, Which it would give in rivulets to thy root, Thou temptest none, but rather much forbidd'st The feller's toil, which thou couldst ill requite. Yet is thy root sincere, sound as the rock, A quarry of stout spurs, and knotted fangs, Which, crook'd into a thousand whimsies, clasp The stubborn soil, and hold thee still erect. So stands a kingdom, whose foundation yet Fails not, in virtue and in wisdom laid, Though all the superstructure, by the tooth Pulverized of venality, a shell Stands now, and semblance only of itself! Thine arms have left thee. Winds have rent them off Long since, and rovers of the forest wild With bow and shaft, have burnt them. Some have left A splinter'd stump, bleach'd to a snowy white; And some, memorial none, where once they grew. Yet life still lingers in thee, and puts forth Proof not contemptible of what she can, Even where death predominates. The spring Finds thee not less alive to her sweet force, Than yonder upstarts of the neighbouring wood, So much thy juniors, who their birth received Half a millenium since the date of thine. But since, although well qualified by age To teach, no spirit dwells in thee, nor voice May be expected from thee, seated here On thy distorted root, with hearers none, Or prompter, save the scene, I will perform Myself the oracle, and will discourse In my own ear such matter as I may. One man alone, the father of us all, Drew not his life from woman; never gazed, With mute unconsciousness of what he saw, On all around him; learn'd not by degrees, Nor owed articulation to his ear; But, moulded by his Maker into man At once, upstood intelligent, survey'd All creatures, with precision understood Their purport, uses, properties, assign'd To each his name significant, and fill'd With love and wisdom, render'd back to Heaven In praise harmonious the first air he drew. He was excused the penalties of dull Minority. No tutor charged his hand With the thought-tracing quill, or task'd his mind With problems. History, not wanted yet, Lean'd on her elbow, watching Time, whose course, Eventful, should supply her with a theme. TO THE NIGHTINGALE, WHICH THE AUTHOR HEARD SING ON NEW YEAR'S DAY, 1792. Whence is it, that amazed I hear From yonder wither'd spray, This foremost morn of all the year, The melody of May? And why, since thousands would be proud Of such a favour shown, Am I selected from the crowd, To witness it alone? Sing'st thou, sweet Philomel, to me, For that I also long Have practised in the groves like thee, Though not like thee in song? Or sing'st thou rather under force Of some divine command, Commission'd to presage a course Of happier days at hand? Thrice welcome then! for many a long And joyless year have I, As thou to day, put forth my song Beneath a wintry sky. But Thee no wintry skies can harm, Who only need'st to sing, To make even January charm, And every season Spring. LINES WRITTEN FOR INSERTION IN A COLLECTION OF HANDWRITINGS AND SIGNATURES MADE BY MISS PATTY, SISTER OF HANNAH MORE. March 6, 1792. In vain to live from age to age While modern bards endeavour, I write my name in Patty's page, And gain my point for ever. W. COWPER. EPITAPH ON A FREE BUT TAME REDBREAST, A FAVOURITE OF MISS SALLY HURDIS. March, 1792. These are not dew-drops, these are tears, And tears by Sally shed For absent Robin, who she fears With too much cause, is dead. One morn he came not to her hand As he was wont to come, And, on her finger perch'd, to stand Picking his breakfast-crumb. Alarm'd she call'd him, and perplext She sought him, but in vain; That day he came not, nor the next, Nor ever came again. She therefore raised him here a tomb, Though where he fell, or how, None knows, so secret was his doom, Nor where he moulders now. Had half a score of coxcombs died, In social Robin's stead, Poor Sally's tears had soon been dried, Or haply never shed. But Bob was neither rudely bold Nor spiritlessly tame, Nor was, like theirs, his bosom cold, But always in a flame. SONNET TO WILLIAM WILBERFORCE, ESQ. April 16, 1792. Thy country, Wilberforce, with just disdain, Hears thee by cruel men and impious call'd Fanatic, for thy zeal to loose the enthrall'd From exile, public sale, and slavery's chain. Friend of the poor, the wrong'd, the fetter-gall'd, Fear not lest labour such as thine be vain. Thou hast achieved a part; hast gain'd the ear Of Britain's senate to thy glorious cause; Hope smiles, joy springs, and though cold caution pause And weave delay, the better hour is near That shall remunerate thy toils severe By peace for Afric, fenced with British laws. Enjoy what thou hast won, esteem and love From all the just on earth, and all the blest above. EPIGRAM. (PRINTED IN THE NORTHAMPTON MERCURY.) To purify their wine some people bleed A lamb into the barrel, and succeed; No nostrum, planters say, is half so good To make fine sugar, as a negro's blood. Now lambs and negroes both are harmless things, And thence perhaps this wonderous virtue springs. 'Tis in the blood of innocence alone— Good cause why planters never try their own. TO DR. AUSTIN, OF CECIL STREET, LONDON. May 26, 1792. Austin! accept a grateful verse from me, The poet's treasure, no inglorious fee. Loved by the Muses, thy ingenuous mind Pleasing requital in my verse may find; Verse oft has dash'd the scythe of Time aside, Immortalizing names which else had died. And oh! could I command the glittering wealth With which sick kings are glad to purchase health; Yet, if extensive fame, and sure to live, Were in the power of verse like mine to give, I would not recompense his art with less, Who, giving Mary health, heals my distress. Friend of my friend Hayley.! I love thee, though unknown, And boldly call thee, being his, my own. SONNET ADDRESSED TO WILLIAM HAYLEY, ESQ. June 2, 1792. Hayley, thy tenderness fraternal shown In our first interview, delightful guest! To Mary and me for her dear sake distress'd, Such as it is has made my heart thy own, Though heedless now of new engagements grown; For threescore winters make a wintry breast, And I had purposed ne'er to go in quest Of Friendship more, except with God alone. But Thou hast won me; nor is God my foe, Who, ere this last afflictive scene began, Sent Thee to mitigate the dreadful blow, My Brother, by whose sympathy I know Thy true deserts infallibly to scan, Not more to admire the Bard than love the Man. MARY AND JOHN. If John marries Mary, and Mary alone, 'Tis a very good match between Mary and John. Should John wed a score, Oh, the claws and the scratches! It can't be a match:—'tis a bundle of matches. TO SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. Dear President, whose art sublime Gives perpetuity to time, And bids transactions of a day, That fleeting hours would waft away To dark futurity, survive, And in unfading beauty live,— You cannot with a grace decline A special mandate of the Nine, Yourself, whatever task you choose, So much indebted to the Muse. Thus say the sisterhood:—We come; Fix well your pallet on your thumb, Prepare the pencil and the tints, We come to furnish you with hints. French disappointment, British glory, Must be the subject of the story. First strike a curve, a graceful bow, Then slope it to a point below; Your outline easy, airy, light, Fill'd up becomes a paper kite. Let independence, sanguine, horrid, Blaze like a meteor in the forehead: Beneath (but lay aside your graces) Draw six-and-twenty rueful faces, Each with a staring, steadfast eye, Fix'd on his great and good ally. France flies the kite—'tis on the wing— Britannia's lightning cuts the string. The wind that raised it, ere it ceases, Just rends it into thirteen pieces, Takes charge of every fluttering sheet, And lays them all at George's feet. Iberia, trembling from afar, Renounces the confederate war; Her efforts and her arts o'ercome, France calls her shatter'd navies home; Repenting Holland learns to mourn The sacred treaties she has torn; Astonishment and awe profound Are stamp'd upon the nations round; Without one friend, above all foes, Britannia gives the world repose. ON THE AUTHOR OF LETTERS ON LITERATURE. The genius of the Augustan age His head among Rome's ruins rear'd, And bursting with heroic rage, When literary Heron appear'd, Thou hast, he cried, like him of old Who set the Ephesian dome on fire, By being scandalously bold, Attain'd the mark of thy desire. And for traducing Virgil's name Shalt share his merited reward; A perpetuity of fame, That rots, and stinks, and is abhorr'd. TO THE REV. WILLIAM BULL. June 22, 1782. MY DEAR FRIEND, If reading verse be your delight, 'Tis mine as much, or more, to write; But what we would, so weak is man, Lies oft remote from what we can. For instance, at this very time, I feel a wish, by cheerful rhyme, To soothe my friend, and, had I power, To cheat him of an anxious hour; Not meaning, (for, I must confess, It were but folly to suppress,) His pleasure or his good alone, But squinting partly at my own. But though the sun is flaming high In the centre of yon arch, the sky, And he had once (and who but he?) The name for setting genius free, Yet whether poets of past days Yielded him undeserved praise, And he by no uncommon lot Was famed for virtues he had not; Or whether, which is like enough, His Highness may have taken huff, So seldom sought with invocation, Since it has been the reigning fashion To disregard his inspiration, I seem no brighter in my wits, For all the radiance he emits, Than if I saw, through midnight vapour, The glimmering of a farthing taper. Oh for a succedaneum, then, To' accelerate a creeping pen! Oh for a ready succedaneum, Quod caput, cerebrum, et cranium Pondere liberet exoso, Et morbo jam caliginoso! 'Tis here; this oval box well fill'd With best tobacco, finely mill'd, Beats all Anticyra's pretences To disengage the encumber'd senses. Oh Nymph of Transatlantic fame, Where'er thine haunt, whate'er thy name. Whether reposing on the side Of Oroonoquo's spacious tide, Or listening with delight not small To Niagara's distant fall, 'Tis thine to cherish and to feed The pungent nose-refreshing weed, Which, whether pulverized it gain A speedy passage to the brain, Or whether, touch'd with fire, it rise In circling eddies to the skies, Does thought more quicken and refine Than all the breath of all the Nine; Forgive the bard, if bard he be, Who once too wantonly made free, To touch with a satiric wipe That symbol of thy power, the pipe; So may no blight infest thy plains, And no unseasonable rains; And so may smiling peace once more Visit America's sad shore; And thou, secure from all alarms, Of thundering drums, and glittering arms, Rove unconfined beneath the shade Thy wide-expanded leaves have made; So may thy votaries increase, And fumigation never cease. May Newton with renew'd delights Perform thine odoriferous rites, While clouds of incense half divine Involve thy disappearing shrine; And so may smoke-inhaling Bull Be always filling, never full. CATHARINA. TO MISS STAPLETON, NOW MRS. COURTENAY. She came—she is gone—we have met— And meet perhaps never again; The sun of that moment is set, And seems to have risen in vain; Catharina has fled like a dream, (So vanishes pleasure, alas!) But has left a regret and esteem That will not so suddenly pass. The last evening ramble we made, Catharina, Maria, and I, Our progress was often delay'd By the nightingale warbling nigh. We paused under many a tree, And much she was charm'd with a tone Less sweet to Maria and me, Who so lately had witness'd her own. My numbers that day she had sung, And gave them a grace so divine, As only her musical tongue Could infuse into numbers of mine. The longer I heard, I esteem'd The work of my fancy the more, And e'en to myself never seem'd So tuneful a poet before. Though the pleasures of London exceed In number the days of the year, Catharina, did nothing impede, Would feel herself happier here; For the close-woven arches of limes On the banks of our river, I know, Are sweeter to her many times Than aught that the city can show. So it is, when the mind is endued With a well judging taste from above, Then, whether embellish'd or rude, 'Tis nature alone that we love. The achievements of art may amuse, May even our wonder excite, But groves, hills, and valleys diffuse A lasting, a sacred delight. Since then in the rural recess Catharina alone can rejoice, May it still be her lot to possess The scene of her sensible choice! To inhabit a mansion remote From the clatter of street-pacing steeds, And by Philomel's annual note To measure the life that she leads. With her book, and her voice, and her lyre, To wing all her moments at home, And with scenes that new rapture inspire, As oft as it suits her to roam, She will have just the life she prefers, With little to hope or to fear, And ours would be pleasant as hers, Might we view her enjoying it here. CATHARINA: THE SECOND PART. ON HER MARRIAGE TO GEORGE COURTENAY, ESQ. June, 1792. Believe it or not, as you chuse, The doctrine is certainly true, That the future is known to the Muse, And poets are oracles too. I did but express a desire, To see Catharina at home, At the side of my friend George's fire, And lo—she is actually come. Such prophecy some may despise, But the wish of a poet and friend Perhaps is approved in the skies, And therefore attains to its end. 'Twas a wish that flew ardently forth From a bosom effectually warm'd With the talents, the graces, and worth Of the person for whom it was form'd. Maria would leave us, I knew, To the grief and regret of us all, But less to our grief, could we view Catharina the Queen of the Hall. And therefore I wish'd as I did, And therefore this union of hands; Not a whisper was heard to forbid, But all cry, Amen! to the bans. Since therefore I seem to incur No danger of wishing in vain, When making good wishes for Her, I will e'en to my wishes again; With one I have made her a Wife, And now I will try with another, Which I cannot suppress for my life, How soon I can make her a Mother. ON THE RECEIPT OF MY MOTHER'S PICTURE OUT OF NORFOLK, THE GIFT OF MY COUSIN, ANN BODHAM. O that those lips had language! Life has pass'd With me but roughly since I heard thee last. Those lips are thine—thy own sweet smile I see, The same that oft in childhood solaced me; Voice only fails, else how distinct they say, “Grieve not, my child, chase all thy fears away!” The meek intelligence of those dear eyes (Blest be the art that can immortalize, The art that baffles Time's tyrannic claim To quench it!) here shines on me still the same. Faithful remembrancer of one so dear, O welcome guest, though unexpected here! Who bidst me honour with an artless song, Affectionate, a mother lost so long, I will obey, not willingly alone, But gladly, as the precept were her own; And, while that face renews my filial grief, Fancy shall weave a charm for my relief, Shall steep me in Elysian reverie, A momentary dream, that thou art she. My mother! when I learn'd that thou wast dead, Say, wast thou conscious of the tears I shed? Hover'd thy spirit o'er thy sorrowing son, Wretch even then, life's journey just begun? Perhaps thou gavest me, though unfelt, a kiss; Perhaps a tear, if souls can weep in bliss— Ah, that maternal smile!—it answers—Yes. I heard the bell toll'd on thy burial day, I saw the hearse that bore thee slow away, And, turning from my nursery window, drew A long, long sigh, and wept a last adieu! But was it such?—It was.—Where thou art gone Adieus and farewells are a sound unknown. May I but meet thee on that peaceful shore, The parting word shall pass my lips no more! Thy maidens, grieved themselves at my concern, Oft gave me promise of thy quick return. What ardently I wish'd, I long believed, And disappointed still, was still deceived; By expectation every day beguiled, Dupe of to-morrow even from a child. Thus many a sad to-morrow came and went, Till, all my stock of infant sorrows spent, I learn'd at last submission to my lot, But, though I less deplored thee, ne'er forgot. Where once we dwelt our name is heard no more, Children not thine have trod my nursery floor; And where the gardener Robin, day by day, Drew me to school along the public way, Delighted with my bauble coach, and wrapt In scarlet mantle warm, and velvet-capt, 'Tis now become a history little known, That once we call'd the pastoral house our own. Shortlived possession! But the record fair, That memory keeps of all thy kindness there, Still outlives many a storm, that has effaced A thousand other themes less deeply traced. Thy nightly visits to my chamber made, That thou mightst know me safe and warmly laid; Thy morning bounties ere I left my home, The biscuit, or confectionary plum; The fragrant waters on my cheeks bestow'd By thy own hand, till fresh they shone and glow'd: All this, and more endearing still than all, Thy constant flow of love, that knew no fall, Ne'er roughen'd by those cataracts and breaks, That humour interposed too often makes; All this still legible in memory's page, And still to be so to my latest age, Adds joy to duty, makes me glad to pay Such honours to thee as my numbers may; Perhaps a frail memorial, but sincere, Not scorn'd in heaven, though little noticed here. Could Time, his flight reversed, restore the hours, When, playing with thy vesture's tissued flowers, The violet, the pink, and jessamine, I prick'd them into paper with a pin, (And thou wast happier than myself the while, Wouldst softly speak, and stroke my head, and smile,) Could those few pleasant days again appear, Might one wish bring them, would I wish them here? I would not trust my heart;—the dear delight Seems so to be desired, perhaps I might.— But no—what here we call our life is such, So little to be loved, and thou so much, That I should ill requite thee to constrain Thy unbound spirit into bonds again. Thou, as a gallant bark from Albion's coast (The storms all weather'd and the ocean cross'd) Shoots into port at some well haven'd isle, Where spices breathe, and brighter seasons smile, There sits quiescent on the floods, that show Her beauteous form reflected clear below, While airs impregnated with incense play Around her, fanning light her streamers gay; So thou, with sails how swift! hast reach'd the shore, “Where tempests never beat nor billows roar Garth.;” And thy loved consort on the dangerous tide Of life long since has anchor'd by thy side. But me, scarce hoping to attain that rest, Always from port withheld, always distress'd,— Me howling blasts drive devious, tempest-toss'd, Sails ripp'd, seams opening wide, and compass lost, And day by day some current's thwarting force Sets me more distant from a prosperous course. Yet O the thought, that thou art safe, and he! That thought is joy, arrive what may to me. My boast is not that I deduce my birth From loins enthroned, and rulers of the earth; But higher far my proud pretensions rise,— The son of parents pass'd into the skies. And now, farewell!—Time unrevoked has run His wonted course, yet what I wish'd is done. By contemplation's help, not sought in vain, I seem to have lived my childhood o'er again; To have renew'd the joys that once were mine, Without the sin of violating thine; And, while the wings of fancy still are free, And I can view this mimic show of thee, Time has but half succeeded in his theft,— Thyself removed, thy power to soothe me left. THE POPLAR FIELD. The poplars are fell'd; farewell to the shade, And the whispering sound of the cool colonnade! The winds play no longer and sing in the leaves, Nor Ouse on his bosom their image receives. Twelve years have elapsed since I first took a view Of my favourite field, and the bank where they grew; And now in the grass behold they are laid, And the tree is my seat that once lent me a shade! The blackbird has fled to another retreat, Where the hazels afford him a screen from the heat, And the scene where his melody charm'd me before Resounds with his sweet flowing ditty no more. My fugitive years are all hasting away, And I must ere long lie as lowly as they, With a turf on my breast, and a stone at my head, Ere another such grove shall arise in its stead. 'Tis a sight to engage me, if any thing can, To muse on the perishing pleasures of man; Though his life be a dream, his enjoyments, I see, Have a being less durable even than he. ON A MISCHIEVOUS BULL, WHICH THE OWNER OF HIM SOLD AT THE AUTHOR'S INSTANCE. Go!—thou art all unfit to share The pleasures of this place With such as its old tenants are, Creatures of gentler race. The squirrel here his hoard provides, Aware of wintry storms; And woodpeckers explore the sides Of rugged oaks for worms. The sheep here smooths the knotted thorn With frictions of her fleece; And here I wander eve and morn, Like her, a friend to peace. Ah!—I could pity thee exiled From this secure retreat;— I would not lose it to be styled The happiest of the great. But thou canst taste no calm delight; Thy pleasure is to show Thy magnanimity in fight, Thy prowess,—therefore, go! I care not whether east or north, So I no more may find thee; The angry Muse thus sings thee forth, And claps the gate behind thee. AN EPITAPH. 1792. Here lies one who never drew Blood himself, yet many slew; Gave the gun its aim, and figure Made in field, yet ne'er pull'd trigger. Armed men have gladly made Him their guide, and him obey'd; At his signified desire, Would advance, present, and fire. Stout he was, and large of limb, Scores have fled at sight of him; And to all this fame he rose Only following his Nose. Neptune was he call'd; not He Who controuls the boisterous sea, But of happier command, Neptune of the furrow'd land; And, your wonder vain to shorten, Pointer to Sir John Throckmorton. EPITAPH ON FOP, A DOG BELONGING TO LADY THROCKMORTON. August, 1792. Though once a puppy, and though Fop by name, Here moulders one whose bones some honour claim; No sycophant, although of spaniel race, And though no hound, a martyr to the chase. Ye squirrels, rabbits, leverets, rejoice! Your haunts no longer echo to his voice; This record of his fate exulting view, He died worn out with vain pursuit of you. “Yes”—the indignant shade of Fop replies— “And worn with vain pursuit man also dies.” SONNET TO GEORGE ROMNEY, ESQ. ON HIS PICTURE OF ME IN CRAYONS, DRAWN AT EARTHAM, IN THE SIXTY-FIRST YEAR OF MY AGE, AND IN THE MONTHS OF AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER, 1792. October, 1792. Romney, expert infallibly to trace On chart or canvass, not the form alone And semblance, but, however faintly shown, The mind's impression too on every face; With strokes that time ought never to erase Thou hast so pencil'd mine, that though I own The subject worthless, I have never known The artist shining with superior grace. But this I mark,—that symptoms none of woe In thy incomparable work appear. Well—I am satisfied it should be so, Since, on maturer thought, the cause is clear; For in my looks what sorrow couldst thou see When I was Hayley's guest, and sat to thee? ON RECEIVING HAYLEY'S PICTURE. January, 1793. In language warm as could be breathed or penn'd Thy picture speaks the original my friend, Not by those looks that indicate thy mind, They only speak thee friend of all mankind; Expression here more soothing still I see, That friend of all a partial friend to me. EPITAPH ON MR. CHESTER, OF CHICHELEY. April, 1793. Tears flow, and cease not, where the good man lies, Till all who know him follow to the skies. Tears therefore fall where Chester's ashes sleep; Him wife, friends, brothers, children, servants, weep;— And justly—few shall ever him transcend As husband, parent, brother, master, friend. ON A PLANT OF VIRGIN'S-BOWER, DESIGNED TO COVER A GARDEN-SEAT. Spring of 1793. Thrive, gentle plant! and weave a bower For Mary and for me, And deck with many a splendid flower Thy foliage large and free. Thou camest from Eartham, and wilt shade, (If truly I divine,) Some future day the illustrious head Of him who made thee mine. Should Daphne show a jealous frown, And Envy seize the Bay, Affirming none so fit to crown Such honour'd brows as they, Thy cause with zeal we shall defend, And with convincing power; For why should not the Virgin's friend Be crown'd with Virgin's Bower? TO MY COUSIN, ANNE BODHAM, ON RECEIVING FROM HER A NETWORK PURSE, MADE BY HERSELF. May 4, 1793. My gentle Anne, whom heretofore, When I was young, and thou no more Than plaything for a nurse, I danced and fondled on my knee, A kitten both in size and glee,— I thank thee for my purse. Gold pays the worth of all things here; But not of love;—that gem's too dear For richest rogues to win it; I, therefore, as a proof of love, Esteem thy present far above The best things kept within it. INSCRIPTION FOR AN HERMITAGE IN THE AUTHOR'S GARDEN. May, 1793. This cabin, Mary, in my sight appears, Built as it has been in our waning years, A rest afforded to our weary feet, Preliminary to—the last retreat. TO MRS. UNWIN. May, 1793. Mary! I want a lyre with other strings, Such aid from Heaven as some have feign'd they drew, An eloquence scarce given to mortals, new And undebased by praise of meaner things, That ere through age or woe I shed my wings, I may record thy worth with honour due, In verse as musical as thou art true, And that immortalizes whom it sings. But thou hast little need. There is a book By seraphs writ with beams of heavenly light, On which the eyes of God not rarely look, A chronicle of actions just and bright; There all thy deeds, my faithful Mary, shine; And, since thou own'st that praise, I spare thee mine. TO JOHN JOHNSON, ON HIS PRESENTING ME WITH AN ANTIQUE BUST OF HOMER. May, 1793. Kinsman beloved, and as a son, by me! When I behold this fruit of thy regard, The sculptured form of my old favourite bard, I reverence feel for him, and love for thee. Joy too and grief. Much joy that there should be Wise men and learn'd, who grudge not to reward With some applause my bold attempt and hard, Which others scorn: critics by courtesy. The grief is this, that sunk in Homer's mine, I lose my precious years now soon to fail, Handling his gold, which howsoe'er it shine, Proves dross, when balanced in the Christian scale. Be wiser thou;—like our forefather Donne, Seek heavenly wealth, and work for God alone. TO A YOUNG FRIEND, ON HIS ARRIVING AT CAMBRIDGE WET, WHEN NO RAIN HAD FALLEN THERE. May, 1793. If Gideon's fleece, which drench'd with dew he found, While moisture none refresh'd the herbs around, Might fitly represent the Church, endow'd With heavenly gifts to heathens not allow'd; In pledge, perhaps, of favours from on high, Thy locks were wet when others' locks were dry. Heaven grant us half the omen,—may we see Not drought on others, but much dew on thee! A TALE. June, 1793. In Scotland's realm, where trees are few, Nor even shrubs abound; But where, however bleak the view, Some better things are found; For husband there and wife may boast Their union undefiled, And false ones are as rare almost As hedge-rows in the wild; In Scotland's realm forlorn and bare The history chanced of late,— This history of a wedded pair, A chaffinch and his mate. The spring drew near, each felt a breast With genial instinct fill'd; They pair'd, and would have built a nest, But found not where to build. The heaths uncover'd and the moors Except with snow and sleet, Sea-beaten rocks and naked shores Could yield them no retreat. Long time a breeding-place they sought, Till both grew vex'd and tired; At length a ship arriving brought The good so long desired. A ship?—could such a restless thing Afford them place of rest? Or was the merchant charged to bring The homeless birds a nest? Hush!—silent hearers profit most,— This racer of the sea Proved kinder to them than the coast, It served them with a tree. But such a tree! 'twas shaven deal, The tree they call a mast, And had a hollow with a wheel Through which the tackle pass'd. Within that cavity aloft Their roofless home they fix'd, Form'd with materials neat and soft, Bents, wool, and feathers mix'd. Four ivory eggs soon pave its floor, With russet specks bedight; The vessel weighs, forsakes the shore, And lessens to the sight. The mother-bird is gone to sea, As she had changed her kind; But goes the male? Far wiser he Is doubtless left behind. No;—Soon as from ashore he saw The winged mansion move, He flew to reach it, by a law Of never-failing love. Then perching at his consort's side, Was briskly borne along, The billows and the blast defied, And cheer'd her with a song. The seaman with sincere delight His feather'd shipmates eyes, Scarce less exulting in the sight Than when he tows a prize. For seamen much believe in signs, And from a chance so new Each some approaching good divines, And may his hopes be true! Hail, honour'd land! a desert where Not even birds can hide, Yet parent of this loving pair Whom nothing could divide. And ye who, rather than resign Your matrimonial plan, Were not afraid to plough the brine In company with man; For whose lean country much disdain We English often show, Yet from a richer nothing gain But wantonness and woe; Be it your fortune, year by year, The same resource to prove, And may ye, sometimes landing here, Instruct us how to love! TO WILLIAM HAYLEY, ESQ. June 29, 1793. Dear architect of fine chateaux in air, Worthier to stand for ever, if they could, Than any built of stone, or yet of wood, For back of royal elephant to bear; O for permission from the skies to share, Much to my own, though little to thy good, With thee, (not subject to the jealous mood! A partnership of literary ware! But I am bankrupt now; and doom'd henceforth To drudge, in descant dry, on others' lays; Bards, I acknowledge, of unequall'd worth, But what is commentator's happiest praise? That he has furnish'd lights for other eyes, Which they who need them use, and then despise. ON A SPANIEL, CALLED BEAU, KILLING A YOUNG BIRD. July 15, 1793. A spaniel, Beau, that fares like you, Well fed, and at his ease, Should wiser be than to pursue Each trifle that he sees. But you have kill'd a tiny bird, Which flew not till to-day, Against my orders, whom you heard Forbidding you the prey. Nor did you kill that you might eat, And ease a doggish pain, For him, though chased with furious heat, You left where he was slain. Nor was he of the thievish sort, Or one whom blood allures, But innocent was all his sport Whom you have torn for yours. My dog! what remedy remains, Since, teach you all I can, I see you, after all my pains, So much resemble man! BEAU'S REPLY. Sir, when I flew to seize the bird In spite of your command, A louder voice than yours I heard, And harder to withstand. You cried—forbear!—but in my breast A mightier cried—proceed!— 'Twas nature, sir, whose strong behest Impell'd me to the deed. Yet much as nature I respect, I ventured once to break (As you perhaps may recollect) Her precept for your sake; And when your linnet on a day, Passing his prison door, Had flutter'd all his strength away, And panting press'd the floor; Well knowing him a sacred thing, Not destined to my tooth, I only kiss'd his ruffled wing, And lick'd the feathers smooth. Let my obedience then excuse My disobedience now, Nor some reproof yourself refuse From your aggrieved bow-wow; If killing birds be such a crime, (Which I can hardly see,) What think you, sir, of killing time With verse address'd to me? TO THE SPANISH ADMIRAL COUNT GRAVINA, ON HIS TRANSLATING THE AUTHOR'S SONG ON A ROSE INTO ITALIAN VERSE. 1793. My rose, Gravina, blooms anew; And steep'd not now in rain, But in Castalian streams by you, Will never fade again. ON FLAXMAN'S PENELOPE. Sept. 1793. The suitors sinn'd, but with a fair excuse, Whom all this elegance might well seduce; Nor can our censure on the husband fall, Who, for a wife so lovely, slew them all. ON RECEIVING HEYNE'S VIRGIL FROM MR. HAYLEY. Oct. 1793. I should have deem'd it once an effort vain To sweeten more sweet Maro's matchless strain, But from that error now behold me free, Since I received him as a gift from thee. TO MARY. Autumn of 1793. The twentieth year is well nigh past, Since first our sky was overcast;— Ah would that this might be the last! My Mary! Thy spirits have a fainter flow, I see thee daily weaker grow;— 'Twas my distress that brought thee low, My Mary! Thy needles, once a shining store, For my sake restless heretofore, Now rust disused, and shine no more, My Mary! For though thou gladly wouldst fulfil The same kind office for me still, Thy sight now seconds not thy will, My Mary! But well thou play'dst the housewife's part, And all thy threads with magic art Have wound themselves about this heart, My Mary! Thy indistinct expressions seem Like language utter'd in a dream; Yet me they charm, whate'er the theme, My Mary! Thy silver locks, once auburn bright, Are still more lovely in my sight Than golden beams of orient light, My Mary! For could I view nor them nor thee, What sight worth seeing could I see? The sun would rise in vain for me, My Mary! Partakers of thy sad decline, Thy hands their little force resign; Yet gently prest, press gently mine, My Mary! Such feebleness of limbs thou provest, That now at every step thou movest Upheld by two, yet still thou lovest, My Mary! And still to love, though prest with ill, In wintry age to feel no chill, With me is to be lovely still, My Mary! But ah! by constant heed I know, How oft the sadness that I show, Transforms thy smiles to looks of woe, My Mary! And should my future lot be cast With much resemblance of the past, Thy worn-out heart will break at last, My Mary! ON THE ICE ISLANDS, SEEN FLOATING IN THE GERMAN OCEAN. March 19, 1799. What portents, from what distant region, ride, Unseen till now in ours, the astonish'd tide? In ages past, old Proteus, with his droves Of sea-calves, sought the mountains and the groves; But now, descending whence of late they stood, Themselves the mountains seem to rove the flood; Dire times were they, full-charged with human woes; And these, scarce less calamitous than those. What view we now? More wondrous still! Behold! Like burnish'd brass they shine, or beaten gold; And all around the pearl's pure splendour show, And all around the ruby's fiery glow. Come they from India, where the burning earth, All bounteous, gives her richest treasures birth; And where the costly gems, that beam around The brows of mightiest potentates, are found? No. Never such a countless dazzling store Had left, unseen, the Ganges' peopled shore; Rapacious hands, and ever-watchful eyes, Should sooner far have mark'd and seized the prize. Whence sprang they then? Ejected have they come From Ves'vius', or from Ætna's burning womb? Thus shine they self-illumed, or but display The borrow'd splendours of a cloudless day? With borrow'd beams they shine. The gales, that breathe Now landward, and the current's force beneath, Have borne them nearer; and the nearer sight, Advantaged more, contemplates them aright. Their lofty summits crested high, they show, With mingled sleet, and long-incumbent snow, The rest is ice. Far hence, where, most severe, Bleak Winter well-nigh saddens all the year, Their infant growth began. He bade arise Their uncouth forms, portentous in our eyes. Oft as dissolved by transient suns, the snow Left the tall cliff to join the flood below, He caught, and curdled with a freezing blast The current, ere it reach'd the boundless waste. By slow degrees uprose the wondrous pile, And long successive ages roll'd the while, Till, ceaseless in its growth, it claim'd to stand Tall as its rival mountains on the land. Thus stood, and, unremovable by skill, Or force of man, had stood the structure still; But that, though firmly fixt, supplanted yet By pressure of its own enormous weight, It left the shelving beach,—and with a sound That shook the bellowing waves and rocks around, Self-launch'd, and swiftly, to the briny wave, As if instinct with strong desire to lave, Down went the ponderous mass. So bards of old, How Delos swam the Ægean deep, have told. But not of ice was Delos. Delos bore Herb, fruit, and flower. She, crown'd with laurel, wore Even under wintry skies, a summer smile; And Delos was Apollo's favourite isle. But, horrid wanderers of the deep, to you He deems Cimmerian darkness only due. Your hated birth he deign'd not to survey, But, scornful, turn'd his glorious eyes away. Hence! Seek your home, nor longer rashly dare The darts of Phœbus, and a softer air; Lest ye regret, too late, your native coast, In no congenial gulf for ever lost! THE SALAD. BY VIRGIL. June 8, 1799. The winter night now well nigh worn away, The wakeful cock proclaim'd approaching day, When Simulus, poor tenant of a farm Of narrowest limits, heard the shrill alarm, Yawn'd, stretch'd his limbs, and anxious to provide Against the pangs of hunger unsupplied, By slow degrees his tatter'd bed forsook, And poking in the dark, explored the nook Where embers slept with ashes heap'd around, And with burnt fingers'-ends the treasure found. It chanced that from a brand beneath his nose, Sure proof of latent fire, some smoke arose; When trimming with a pin the incrusted tow, And stooping it towards the coals below, He toils, with cheeks distended, to excite The lingering flame, and gains at length a light. With prudent heed he spreads his hand before The quivering lamp, and opes his granary door. Small was his stock, but taking for the day, A measured stint of twice eight pounds away, With these his mill he seeks. A shelf at hand, Fixt in the wall, affords his lamp a stand: Then baring both his arms, a sleeveless coat He girds, the rough exuviæ of a goat; And with a rubber, for that use design'd, Cleansing his mill within, begins to grind; Each hand has its employ; labouring amain, This turns the winch, while that supplies the grain. The stone revolving rapidly, now glows, And the bruised corn a mealy current flows; While he, to make his heavy labour light, Tasks oft his left hand to relieve his right; And chants with rudest accent, to beguile His ceaseless toil, as rude a strain the while. And now, “Dame Cybale, come forth!” he cries; But Cybale, still slumbering, nought replies. From Afric she, the swain's sole serving-maid, Whose face and form alike her birth betray'd; With woolly locks, lips tumid, sable skin, Wide bosom, udders flaccid, belly thin, Legs slender, broad and most misshapen feet, Chapp'd into chinks, and parch'd with solar heat. Such, summon'd oft, she came; at his command Fresh fuel heap'd, the sleeping embers fann'd, And made in haste her simmering skillet steam, Replenish'd newly from the neighbouring stream. The labours of the mill perform'd, a sieve The mingled flour and bran must next receive, Which shaken oft, shoots Ceres through refined, And better dress'd, her husks all left behind. This done, at once, his future plain repast, Unleaven'd, on a shaven board he cast, With tepid lymph, first largely soak'd it all, Then gather'd it with both hands to a ball, And spreading it again with both hands wide, With sprinkled salt the stiffen'd mass supplied; At length, the stubborn substance, duly wrought, Takes from his palms impress'd the shape it ought, Becomes an orb, and quarter'd into shares, The faithful mark of just division bears. Last, on his hearth it finds convenient space, For Cybale before had swept the place, And there, with tiles and embers overspread, She leaves it—reeking in its sultry bed. Nor Similus, while Vulcan thus, alone, His part perform'd, proves heedless of his own, But sedulous, not merely to subdue His hunger, but to please his palate too, Prepares more savoury food. His chimney-side Could boast no gammon, salted well, and dried, And hook'd behind him; but sufficient store Of bundled anise, and a cheese it bore; A broad round cheese, which, through its centre strung With a tough broom-twig, in the corner hung; The prudent hero therefore with address, And quick dispatch, now seeks another mess. Close to his cottage lay a garden-ground, With reeds and osiers sparely girt around; Small was the spot, but liberal to produce, Nor wanted aught that serves a peasant's use; And sometimes even the rich would borrow thence, Although its tillage was his sole expense. For oft, as from his toils abroad he ceased, Home-bound by weather or some stated feast, His debt of culture here he duly paid, And only left the plough to wield the spade. He knew to give each plant the soil it needs, To drill the ground, and cover close the seeds; And could with ease compel the wanton rill To turn, and wind, obedient to his will. There flourish'd star-wort, and the branching beet, The sorrel acid, and the mallow sweet, The skirret, and the leek's aspiring kind, The noxious poppy—quencher of the mind! Salubrious sequel of a sumptuous board, The lettuce, and the long huge-bellied gourd; But these (for none his appetite controll'd With stricter sway) the thrifty rustic sold; With broom-twigs neatly bound, each kind apart, He bore them ever to the public mart; Whence, laden still, but with a lighter load, Of cash well earn'd, he took his homeward road, Expending seldom, ere he quitted Rome, His gains, in flesh-meat for a feast at home. There, at no cost, on onions, rank and red, Or the curl'd endive's bitter leaf, he fed: On scallions sliced, or with a sensual gust On rockets—foul provocatives of lust; Nor even shunn'd, with smarting gums, to press Nasturtium, pungent face-distorting mess! Some such regale now also in his thought, With hasty steps his garden-ground he sought; There delving with his hands, he first displaced Four plants of garlick, large, and rooted fast; The tender tops of parsley next he culls, Then the old rue-bush shudders as he pulls, And coriander last to these succeeds, That hangs on slightest threads her trembling seeds. Placed near his sprightly fire he now demands The mortar at his sable servant's hands; When stripping all his garlick first, he tore The exterior coats, and cast them on the floor, Then cast away with like contempt the skin, Flimsier concealment of the cloves within. These search'd, and perfect found, he one by one Rinsed, and disposed within the hollow stone; Salt added, and a lump of salted cheese, With his injected herbs he cover'd these, And tucking with his left his tunic tight, And seizing fast the pestle with his right, The garlick bruising first he soon express'd, And mix'd the various juices of the rest. He grinds, and by degrees his herbs below Lost in each other their own powers forego, And with the cheese in compound, to the sight Nor wholly green appear, nor wholly white. His nostrils oft the forceful fume resent; He cursed full oft his dinner for its scent, Or with wry faces, wiping as he spoke The trickling tears, cried—“Vengeance on the smoke!” The work proceeds: not roughly turns he now The pestle, but in circles smooth and slow; With cautious hand that grudges what it spills, Some drops of olive-oil he next instils; Then vinegar with caution scarcely less; And gathering to a ball the medley mess, Last, with two fingers frugally applied, Sweeps the small remnant from the mortar's side: And thus complete in figure and in kind, Obtains at length the Salad he design'd. And now black Cybale before him stands, The cake drawn newly glowing in her hands: He glad receives it, chasing far away All fears of famine for the passing day; His legs enclosed in buskins, and his head In its tough casque of leather, forth he led And yoked his steers, a dull obedient pair, Then drove afield, and plunged the pointed share. THE CAST-AWAY. March 20, 1799. Obscurest night involved the sky, The Atlantic billows roar'd, When such a destined wretch as I, Wash'd headlong from on board, Of friends, of hope, of all bereft, His floating home for ever left. No braver chief could Albion boast Than he, with whom he went, Nor ever ship left Albion's coast With warmer wishes sent. He loved them both, but both in vain, Nor him beheld, nor her again. Not long beneath the whelming brine, Expert to swim, he lay; Nor soon he felt his strength decline, Or courage die away; But waged with death a lasting strife, Supported by despair of life. He shouted: nor his friends had fail'd To check the vessel's course, But so the furious blast prevail'd, That pitiless perforce, They left their outcast mate behind, And scudded still before the wind. Some succour yet they could afford; And, such as storms allow, The cask, the coop, the floated cord, Delay'd not to bestow. But he (they knew) nor ship nor shore, Whate'er they gave, should visit more. Nor, cruel as it seem'd, could he Their haste himself condemn, Aware that flight, in such a sea, Alone could rescue them; Yet bitter felt it still to die Deserted, and his friends so nigh. He long survives, who lives an hour In ocean, self-upheld; And so long he, with unspent power, His destiny repell'd; And ever as the minutes flew, Entreated help, or cried—“Adieu!” At length, his transient respite past, His comrades, who before Had heard his voice in every blast, Could catch the sound no more: For then, by toil subdued, he drank The stifling wave, and then he sank. No poet wept him; but the page Of narrative sincere, That tells his name, his worth, his age, Is wet with Anson's tear: And tears by bards or heroes shed Alike immortalize the dead. I therefore purpose not, or dream, Descanting on his fate, To give the melancholy theme A more enduring date: But misery still delights to trace Its 'semblance in another's case. No voice divine the storm allay'd, No light propitious shone, When, snatch'd from all effectual aid, We perish'd, each alone: But I beneath a rougher sea, And whelm'd in deeper gulfs than he. MONUMENTAL INSCRIPTION TO WILLIAM NORTHCOT. Farewell! “But not for ever,” Hope replies, Trace but his steps and meet him in the skies! There nothing shall renew our parting pain, Thou shalt not wither, nor I weep again. A RIDDLE. I am just two and two, I am warm, I am cold, And the parent of numbers that cannot be told. I am lawful, unlawful—a duty, a fault, I am often sold dear, good for nothing when bought; An extraordinary boon, and a matter of course, And yielded with pleasure when taken by force. IN SEDITIONEM HORRENDAM, CORRUPTELIS GALLICIS, UT FERTUR, LONDINI NUPER EXORTAM. False, cruel, disappointed, stung to the heart, France quits the warrior's for the assassin's part, To dirty hands a dirty bribe conveys, Bids the low street and lofty palace blaze. Her sons, too weak to vanquish us alone, She hires the worst and basest of our own. Kneel, France! a suppliant conquers us with ease, We always spare a coward on his knees. [Cowper had sinn'd with some excuse] Cowper had sinn'd with some excuse, If, bound in rhyming tethers, He had committed this abuse Of changing ewes for wethers; I have heard about my wether mutton from various quarters. It was a blunder hardly pardonable in a man who has lived amid fields and meadows, grazed by sheep, almost these thirty years. I have accordingly satirized myself in two stanzas which I composed last night, while I lay awake, tormented with pain, and well dosed with laudanum. If you find them not very brilliant, therefore, you will know how to account for it. —Letter to Joseph Hill, April 15, 1792. But, male for female is a trope, Or rather bold misnomer, That would have startled even Pope, When he translated Homer. STANZAS SUBJOINED TO THE YEARLY BILL OF MORTALITY OF THE PARISH OF ALL-SAINTS, NORTHAMPTON, Anno Domini 1787. Pallida Mors æquo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas, Regumque turres. Horace. Pale Death with equal foot strikes wide the door Of royal halls and hovels of the poor. While thirteen moons saw smoothly run The Nen's barge-laden wave, All these, life's rambling journey done, Have found their home, the grave. Was man (frail always) made more frail Than in foregoing years? Did famine or did plague prevail, That so much death appears? No; these were vigorous as their sires, Nor plague nor famine came; This annual tribute Death requires, And never waives his claim. Like crowded forest-trees we stand, And some are mark'd to fall; The axe will smite at God's command, And soon shall smite us all. Green as the bay tree, ever green, With its new foliage on, The gay, the thoughtless, have I seen, I pass'd,—and they were gone. Read, ye that run, the aweful truth With which I charge my page! A worm is in the bud of youth, And at the root of age. No present health can health insure For yet an hour to come; No medicine, though it oft can cure, Can always balk the tomb. And oh! that humble as my lot, And scorn'd as is my strain, These truths, though known, too much forgot, I may not teach in vain. So prays your Clerk with all his heart, And, ere he quits the pen, Begs you for once to take his part, And answer all—Amen! ON A SIMILAR OCCASION, For the Year 1788. Quod adest, memento Componere æquus. Cætera fluminis Ritu feruntur. Horace. Improve the present hour, for all beside Is a mere feather on a torrent's tide. Could I, from Heaven inspired, as sure presage To whom the rising year shall prove his last, As I can number in my punctual page, And item down the victims of the past; How each would trembling wait the mournful sheet On which the press might stamp him next to die; And, reading here his sentence, how replete With anxious meaning, heavenward turn his eye! Time then would seem more precious than the joys In which he sports away the treasure now; And prayer more seasonable than the noise Of drunkards, or the music-drawing bow. Then doubtless many a trifler, on the brink Of this world's hazardous and headlong shore, Forced to a pause, would feel it good to think, Told that his setting sun must rise no more. Ah self-deceived! Could I prophetic say Who next is fated, and who next to fall, The rest might then seem privileged to play; But, naming none, the Voice now speaks to all. Observe the dappled foresters, how light They bound and airy o'er the sunny glade; One falls—the rest, wide scatter'd with affright, Vanish at once into the darkest shade. Had we their wisdom, should we, often warn'd, Still need repeated warnings, and at last, A thousand aweful admonitions scorn'd, Die self-accused of life run all to waste? Sad waste! for which no after-thrift atones! The grave admits no cure for guilt or sin; Dewdrops may deck the turf that hides the bones, But tears of godly grief ne'er flow within. Learn then, ye living! by the mouths be taught Of all those sepulchres, instructors true, That, soon or late, death also is your lot, And the next opening grave may yawn for you. ON A SIMILAR OCCASION, For the Year 1789. ? Placidaque ibi demum morte quievit. Virg. There calm at length he breathed his soul away. “O most delightful hour by man Experienced here below, The hour that terminates his span, His folly and his woe! “Worlds should not bribe me back to tread Again life's dreary waste, To see again my day o'erspread With all the gloomy past. “My home henceforth is in the skies, Earth, seas, and sun, adieu! All heaven unfolded to my eyes, I have no sight for you.” So spake Aspasio, firm possess'd Of faith's supporting rod, Then breathed his soul into its rest, The bosom of his God. He was a man among the few Sincere on virtue's side; And all his strength from Scripture drew, To hourly use applied. That rule he prized, by that he fear'd, He hated, hoped, and loved; Nor ever frown'd, or sad appear'd, But when his heart had roved. For he was frail as thou or I, And evil felt within: But when he felt it, heaved a sigh, And loathed the thought of sin. Such lived Aspasio; and at last Call'd up from earth to heaven, The gulf of death triumphant pass'd, By gales of blessing driven. His joys be mine, each Reader cries, When my last hour arrives: They shall be yours, my verse replies, Such only be your lives. ON A SIMILAR OCCASION, For the Year 1790. Ne commonentem recta sperne. Buchanan. Despise not my good counsel. He who sits from day to day Where the prison'd lark is hung, Heedless of his loudest lay, Hardly knows that he has sung. Where the watchman in his round Nightly lifts his voice on high, None accustom'd to the sound, Wakes the sooner for his cry. So your verse-man I, and Clerk, Yearly in my song proclaim Death at hand—yourselves his mark— And the foe's unerring aim. Duly at my time I come, Publishing to all aloud,— Soon the grave must be your home, And your only suit a shroud. But the monitory strain, Oft repeated in your ears, Seems to sound too much in vain, Wins no notice, wakes no fears. Can a truth, by all confess'd Of such magnitude and weight, Grow, by being oft impress'd, Trivial as a parrot's prate? Pleasure's call attention wins, Hear it often as we may; New as ever seem our sins, Though committed every day. Death and judgement, heaven and hell— These alone, so often heard, No more move us than the bell When some stranger is interr'd. O then, ere the turf or tomb Cover us from every eye, Spirit of instruction! come, Make us learn that we must die. ON A SIMILAR OCCASION, For the Year 1792. Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas, Atque metus omnes et inexorabile fatum Subjecit pedibus, strepitumque Acherontis avari! Virg. Happy the mortal who has traced effects To their first cause, cast fear beneath his feet, And Death and roaring Hell's voracious fires! Thankless for favours from on high, Man thinks he fades too soon; Though 'tis his privilege to die, Would he improve the boon. But he, not wise enough to scan His blest concerns aright, Would gladly stretch life's little span To ages, if he might; To ages in a world of pain, To ages, where he goes Gall'd by affliction's heavy chain, And hopeless of repose. Strange fondness of the human heart, Enamour'd of its harm! Strange world, that costs it so much smart, And still has power to charm. Whence has the world her magic power? Why deem we death a foe? Recoil from weary life's best hour, And covet longer woe? The cause is Conscience:—Conscience oft Her tale of guilt renews; Her voice is terrible though soft, And dread of death ensues. Then anxious to be longer spared Man mourns his fleeting breath: All evils then seem light compared With the approach of Death. 'Tis judgement shakes him; there's the fear That prompts the wish to stay: He has incurr'd a long arrear, And must despair to pay. Pay?—follow Christ, and all is paid; His death your peace ensures; Think on the grave where he was laid, And calm descend to yours. ON A SIMILAR OCCASION, For the Year 1793. De sacris autem hæc sit una sententia, ut conserventur. Cic. de Leg. But let us all concur in this one sentiment, that things sacred be inviolate. He lives who lives to God alone, And all are dead beside; For other source than God is none Whence life can be supplied. To live to God is to requite His love as best we may; To make his precepts our delight, His promises our stay. But life, within a narrow ring Of giddy joys comprised, Is falsely named, and no such thing, But rather death disguised. Can life in them deserve the name, Who only live to prove For what poor toys they can disclaim An endless life above? Who, much diseased, yet nothing feel; Much menaced, nothing dread; Have wounds which only God can heal, Yet never ask his aid? Who deem his house a useless place, Faith, want of common sense; And ardour in the Christian race, A hypocrite's pretence? Who trample order; and the day Which God asserts his own Dishonour with unhallow'd play, And worship chance alone? If scorn of God's commands, impress'd On word and deed, imply The better part of man unbless'd With life that cannot die; Such want it, and that want, uncured Till man resigns his breath, Speaks him a criminal, assured Of everlasting death. Sad period to a pleasant course! Yet so will God repay Sabbaths profaned without remorse, And mercy cast away. TRANSLATIONS FROM VINCENT BOURNE. THE THRACIAN. Thracian parents, at his birth, Mourn their babe with many a tear, But with undissembled mirth Place him breathless on his bier. Greece and Rome with equal scorn, “O the savages!” exclaim, “Whether they rejoice or mourn, Well entitled to the name!” But the cause of this concern And this pleasure would they trace, Even they might somewhat learn From the savages of Thrace. RECIPROCAL KINDNESS, THE PRIMARY LAW OF NATURE. Androcles from his injured lord in dread Of instant death, to Libya's desert fled. Tired with his toilsome flight, and parch'd with heat, He spied, at length, a cavern's cool retreat, But scarce had given to rest his weary frame, When, hugest of his kind, a lion came: He roar'd approaching; but the savage din To plaintive murmurs changed,—arrived within, And with expressive looks, his lifted paw Presenting, aid implored from whom he saw. The fugitive, through terror at a stand, Dared not awhile afford his trembling hand, But bolder grown, at length inherent found A pointed thorn, and drew it from the wound. The cure was wrought; he wiped the sanious blood, And firm and free from pain the lion stood. Again he seeks the wilds, and day by day, Regales his inmate with the parted prey; Nor he disdains the dole, though unprepared, Spread on the ground, and with a lion shared. But thus to live—still lost—sequester'd still— Scarce seem'd his lord's revenge a heavier ill. Home! native home! O might he but repair! He must, he will, though death attends him there. He goes, and doom'd to perish, on the sands Of the full theatre unpitied stands; When lo! the self-same lion from his cage Flies to devour him, famish'd into rage. He flies, but viewing in his purposed prey The man, his healer, pauses on his way, And soften'd by remembrance into sweet And kind composure, crouches at his feet. Mute with astonishment the assembly gaze: But why, ye Romans? Whence your mute amaze? All this is natural: Nature bade him rend An enemy; she bids him spare a friend. A MANUAL, MORE ANCIENT THAN THE ART OF PRINTING, AND NOT TO BE FOUND IN ANY CATALOGUE. There is a book, which we may call (Its excellence is such) Alone a library, though small; The ladies thumb it much. Words none, things numerous it contains; And, things with words compared, Who needs be told, that has his brains, Which merits most regard? Ofttimes its leaves of scarlet hue A golden edging boast; And open'd, it displays to view Twelve pages at the most. Nor name, nor title, stamp'd behind, Adorns its outer part; But all within 'tis richly lined, A magazine of art. The whitest hands that secret hoard Oft visit; and the fair Preserve it in their bosoms stored, As with a miser's care. Thence implements of every size, And form'd for various use, (They need but to consult their eyes,) They readily produce. The largest and the longest kind Possess the foremost page, A sort most needed by the blind, Or nearly such from age. The full-charged leaf, which next ensues, Presents in bright array The smaller sort, which matrons use, Not quite so blind as they. The third, the fourth, the fifth supply What their occasions ask, Who with a more discerning eye Perform a nicer task. But still with regular decrease From size to size they fall, In every leaf grow less and less; The last are least of all. O! what a fund of genius, pent In narrow space, is here! This volume's method and intent How luminous and clear! It leaves no reader at a loss Or posed, whoever reads: No commentator's tedious gloss, Nor even index needs. Search Bodley's many thousands o'er! No book is treasured there, Nor yet in Granta's numerous store, That may with this compare. No!—rival none in either host Of this was ever seen, Or, that contents could justly boast, So brilliant and so keen. AN ENIGMA. A needle small, as small can be, In bulk and use, surpasses me, Nor is my purchase dear; For little, and almost for nought, As many of my kind are bought As days are in the year. Yet though but little use we boast, And are procured at little cost, The labour is not light; Nor few artificers it asks, All skilful in their several tasks, To fashion us aright. One fuses metal o'er the fire, A second draws it into wire, The shears another plies, Who clips in lengths the brazen thread For him, who, chafing every shred, Gives all an equal size. A fifth prepares, exact and round, The knob, with which it must be crown'd; His follower makes it fast: And with his mallet and his file To shape the point, employs awhile The seventh and the last. Now therefore! Œdipus! declare What creature, wonderful, and rare, A process, that obtains Its purpose with so much ado, At last produces!—tell me true, And take me for your pains! SPARROWS SELF-DOMESTICATED IN TRINITY COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE. None ever shared the social feast, Or as an inmate or a guest, Beneath the celebrated dome, Where once Sir Isaac had his home, Who saw not (and with some delight Perhaps he view'd the novel sight) How numerous, at the tables there, The sparrows beg their daily fare. For there, in every nook and cell, Where such a family may dwell, Sure as the vernal season comes Their nests they weave in hope of crumbs, Which kindly given, may serve with food Convenient their unfeather'd brood; And oft as with its summons clear The warning bell salutes their ear, Sagacious listeners to the sound, They flock from all the fields around, To reach the hospitable hall, None more attentive to the call. Arrived, the pensionary band, Hopping and chirping, close at hand, Solicit what they soon receive, The sprinkled, plenteous donative. Thus is a multitude, though large, Supported at a trivial charge; A single doit would overpay The expenditure of every day, And who can grudge so small a grace To suppliants, natives of the place? FAMILIARITY DANGEROUS. As in her ancient mistress' lap The youthful tabby lay, They gave each other many a tap, Alike disposed to play. But strife ensues. Puss waxes warm, And with protruded claws Ploughs all the length of Lydia's arm, Mere wantonness the cause. At once, resentful of the deed, She shakes her to the ground With many a threat, that she shall bleed With still a deeper wound. But, Lydia, bid thy fury rest; It was a venial stroke: For she that will with kittens jest, Should bear a kitten's joke. INVITATION TO THE REDBREAST. Sweet bird, whom the winter constrains— And seldom another it can— To seek a retreat, while he reigns, In the well-shelter'd dwellings of man, Who never can seem to intrude, Though in all places equally free, Come! oft as the season is rude, Thou art sure to be welcome to me. At sight of the first feeble ray, That pierces the clouds of the east, To inveigle thee every day My windows shall show thee a feast; For, taught by experience I know Thee mindful of benefit long, And that, thankful for all I bestow, Thou wilt pay me with many a song. Then, soon as the swell of the buds Bespeaks the renewal of spring, Fly hence, if thou wilt, to the woods, Or where it shall please thee to sing: And shouldst thou, compell'd by a frost, Come again to my window or door, Doubt not an affectionate host, Only pay, as thou pay'dst me before. Thus music must needs be confest To flow from a fountain above; Else how should it work in the breast Unchangeable friendship and love? And who on the globe can be found, Save your generation and ours, That can be delighted by sound, Or boasts any musical powers? STRADA'S NIGHTINGALE. The shepherd touch'd his reed; sweet Philomel Essay'd, and oft essay'd to catch the strain, And treasuring, as on her ear they fell, The numbers, echoed note for note again. The peevish youth, who ne'er had found before A rival of his skill, indignant heard, And soon (for various was his tuneful store) In loftier tones defied the simple bird. She dared the task, and rising, as he rose, With all the force, that passion gives, inspired, Return'd the sounds awhile, but in the close, Exhausted fell, and at his feet expired. Thus strength, not skill, prevail'd. O fatal strife, By thee, poor songstress, playfully begun! And O sad victory, which cost thy life, And he may wish that he had never won! ODE ON THE DEATH OF A LADY, WHO LIVED ONE HUNDRED YEARS, AND DIED ON HER BIRTHDAY, 1728. Ancient dame, how wide and vast, To a race like ours appears, Rounded to an orb at last, All thy multitude of years! We, the herd of human kind, Frailer and of feebler powers; We, to narrow bounds confined, Soon exhaust the sum of ours. Death's delicious banquet, we Perish even from the womb, Swifter than a shadow flee, Nourish'd, but to feed the tomb. Seeds of merciless disease Lurk in all that we enjoy; Some, that waste us by degrees, Some, that suddenly destroy. And if life o'erleap the bourn, Common to the sons of men, What remains, but that we mourn, Dream, and dote, and drivel then? Fast as moons can wax and wane, Sorrow comes; and while we groan, Pant with anguish and complain, Half our years are fled and gone. If a few, (to few 'tis given,) Lingering on this earthly stage, Creep and halt with steps uneven, To the period of an age; Wherefore live they, but to see Cunning, arrogance, and force, Sights lamented much by thee, Holding their accustom'd course? Oft was seen, in ages past, All that we with wonder view; Often shall be to the last; Earth produces nothing new. Thee we gratulate; content, Should propitious Heaven design Life for us, as calmly spent, Though but half the length of thine. THE CAUSE WON. Two neighbours furiously dispute; A field—the subject of the suit. Trivial the spot, yet such the rage With which the combatants engage, 'Twere hard to tell, who covets most The prize—at whatsoever cost. The pleadings swell. Words still suffice; No single word but has its price: No term but yields some fair pretence For novel and increased expense. Defendant thus becomes a name, Which he, that bore it, may disclaim; Since both, in one description blended, Are plaintiffs—when the suit is ended. THE SILK-WORM. The beams of April, ere it goes, A worm, scarce visible, disclose; All winter long content to dwell The tenant of his native shell. The same prolific season gives The sustenance by which he lives, The mulberry-leaf, a simple store, That serves him—till he needs no more! For, his dimensions once complete, Thenceforth none ever sees him eat; Though, till his growing time be past, Scarce ever is he seen to fast. That hour arrived, his work begins; He spins and weaves, and weaves and spins; Till circle upon circle wound Careless around him and around, Conceals him with a veil, though slight, Impervious to the keenest sight. Thus self-enclosed, as in a cask, At length he finishes his task: And, though a worm, when he was lost, Or caterpillar at the most, When next we see him, wings he wears, And in papilio-pomp appears; Becomes oviparous; supplies With future worms and future flies, The next ensuing year;—and dies! Well were it for the world, if all Who creep about this earthly ball, Though shorter-lived than most he be, Were useful in their kind as he. THE INNOCENT THIEF. Not a flower can be found in the fields, Or the spot that we till for our pleasure, From the largest to least, but it yields The bee, never-wearied, a treasure. Scarce any she quits unexplored, With a diligence truly exact; Yet, steal what she may for her hoard, Leaves evidence none of the fact. Her lucrative task she pursues, And pilfers with so much address, That none of their odour they lose, Nor charm by their beauty the less. Not thus inoffensively preys The canker-worm, indwelling foe! His voracity not thus allays The sparrow, the finch, or the crow. The worm, more expensively fed, The pride of the garden devours; And birds peck the seed from the bed, Still less to be spared than the flowers. But she with such delicate skill, Her pillage so fits for her use, That the chemist in vain with his still Would labour the like to produce. Then grudge not her temperate meals, Nor a benefit blame as a theft; Since, stole she not all that she steals, Neither honey nor wax would be left. DENNER'S OLD WOMAN. In this mimic form of a matron in years, How plainly the pencil of Denner appears! The matron herself, in whose old age we see Not a trace of decline, what a wonder is she! No dimness of eye, and no cheek hanging low, No wrinkle, or deep-furrow'd frown on the brow! Her forehead indeed is here circled around With locks like the ribbon, with which they are bound; While glossy and smooth, and as soft as the skin Of a delicate peach, is the down of her chin; But nothing unpleasant, or sad, or severe, Or that indicates life in its winter, is here. Yet all is express'd, with fidelity due, Nor a pimple, or freckle, conceal'd from the view. Many fond of new sights, or who cherish a taste For the labours of art to the spectacle haste; The youths all agree, that could old age inspire The passion of love, hers would kindle the fire, And the matrons with pleasure confess that they see Ridiculous nothing or hideous in thee. The nymphs for themselves scarcely hope a decline, O wonderful woman! as placid as thine. Strange magic of art! which the youth can engage To peruse, half-enamour'd, the features of age; And force from the virgin a sigh of despair, That she, when as old, shall be equally fair! How great is the glory that Denner has gain'd, Since Apelles not more for his Venus obtain'd! THE TEARS OF A PAINTER. Apelles, hearing that his boy Had just expired, his only joy! Although the sight with anguish tore him, Bade place his dear remains before him. He seized his brush, his colours spread; And—“Oh! my child, accept,”—he said, “('Tis all that I can now bestow,) This tribute of a father's woe!” Then, faithful to the two-fold part, Both of his feelings and his art, He closed his eyes, with tender care, And form'd at once a fellow pair. His brow with amber locks beset, And lips he drew, not livid yet; And shaded all that he had done To a just image of his son. Thus far is well. But view again The cause of thy paternal pain! Thy melancholy task fulfil! It needs the last, last touches still. Again his pencil's powers he tries, For on his lips a smile he spies: And still his cheek unfaded shows The deepest damask of the rose. Then, heedful to the finish'd whole, With fondest eagerness he stole, Till scarce himself distinctly knew The cherub copied from the true. Now, painter, cease! Thy task is done. Long lives this image of thy son; Nor short-lived shall thy glory prove, Or of thy labour, or thy love. THE MAZE. From right to left, and to and fro, Caught in a labyrinth, you go, And turn, and turn, and turn again, To solve the mystery, but in vain; Stand still and breathe, and take from me A clew, that soon shall set you free! Not Ariadne, if you meet her, Herself could serve you with a better. You enter'd easily—find where— And make, with ease, your exit there! NO SORROW PECULIAR TO THE SUFFERER. The lover, in melodious verses, His singular distress rehearses, Still closing with a rueful cry, “Was ever such a wretch as I?” Yes! thousands have endured before All thy distress; some, haply more. Unnumber'd Corydons complain, And Strephons, of the like disdain: And if thy Chloe be of steel, Too deaf to hear, too hard to feel; Not her alone that censure fits, Nor thou alone hast lost thy wits. THE SNAIL. To grass, or leaf, or fruit, or wall, The Snail sticks close, nor fears to fall, As if he grew there, house and all Together. Within that house secure he hides, When danger imminent betides Of storm, or other harm besides Of weather. Give but his horns the slightest touch, His self-collecting power is such, He shrinks into his house with much Displeasure. Where'er he dwells, he dwells alone, Except himself has chattels none, Well satisfied to be his own Whole treasure. Thus, hermit-like, his life he leads, Nor partner of his banquet needs, And if he meets one, only feeds The faster. Who seeks him must be worse than blind, (He and his house are so combined,) If, finding it, he fails to find Its master. THE CANTAB. With two spurs or one; and no great matter which, Boots bought, or boots borrow'd, a whip or a switch, Five shillings or less for the hire of his beast, Paid part into hand,—you must wait for the rest; Thus equipt, Academicus climbs up his horse, And out they both sally for better or worse; His heart void of fear, and as light as a feather; And in violent haste to go not knowing whither: Through the fields and the towns, (see!) he scampers along, And is look'd at, and laugh'd at, by old and by young. Till at length overspent, and his sides smear'd with blood, Down tumbles his horse, man and all in the mud. In a waggon or chaise shall he finish his route? Oh! scandalous fate! he must do it on foot. Young gentlemen, hear!—I am older than you! The advice, that I give, I have proved to be true. Wherever your journey may be, never doubt it, The faster you ride, you're the longer about it. TRANSLATIONS OF THE LATIN AND ITALIAN POEMS OF MILTON. Begun September, 1791. Finished March, 1792. Translations of the Latin Poems. ELEGIES. ELEGY I. TO CHARLES DEODATI. At length, my friend, the far-sent letters come, Charged with thy kindness, to their destined home; They come, at length, from Deva's western side, Where prone she seeks the salt Vergivian tide. Trust me, my joy is great that thou shouldst be, Though born of foreign race, yet born for me, And that my sprightly friend now free to roam, Must seek again so soon his wonted home. I well content, where Thames with influent tide My native city laves, meantime reside, Nor zeal nor duty now my steps impel To reedy Cam, and my forbidden cell. Nor aught of pleasure in those fields have I, That, to the musing bard, all shade deny. 'Tis time that I a pedant's threats disdain, And fly from wrongs my soul will ne'er sustain. If peaceful days, in letter'd leisure spent, Beneath my father's roof, be banishment, Then call me banish'd, I will ne'er refuse A name expressive of the lot I chuse. I would that, exiled to the Pontic shore, Rome's hapless bard had suffer'd nothing more; He then had equall'd even Homer's lays, And Virgil! thou hadst won but second praise. For here I woo the Muse, with no control; And here my books—my life—absorb me whole. Here too I visit, or to smile, or weep, The winding theatre's majestic sweep; The grave or gay colloquial scene recruits My spirits, spent in learning's long pursuits; Whether some senior shrewd, or spendthrift heir, Suitor or soldier, now unarm'd, be there; Or some coif'd brooder o'er a ten years' cause, Thunder the Norman gibberish of the laws. The lacquey there oft dupes the wary sire, And artful speeds the enamour'd son's desire. There, virgins oft, unconscious what they prove, What love is, know not, yet, unknowing, love. Or if impassion'd Tragedy wield high The bloody sceptre, give her locks to fly Wild as the winds, and roll her haggard eye, I gaze, and grieve, still cherishing my grief, At times, even bitter tears yield sweet relief: As when from bliss untasted torn away, Some youth dies, hapless on his bridal day, Or when the ghost, sent back from shades below, Fills the assassin's heart with vengeful woe, When Troy, or Argos, the dire scene affords, Or Creon's hall laments its guilty lords. Nor always city-pent, or pent at home, I dwell; but when spring calls me forth to roam, Expatiate in our proud suburban shades Of branching elm, that never sun pervades. Here many a virgin troop I may descry, Like stars of mildest influence, gliding by. Oh forms divine! Oh looks that might inspire Even Jove himself, grown old, with young desire. Oft have I gazed on gem-surpassing eyes, Out-sparkling every star that gilds the skies. Necks whiter than the ivory arm bestowed By Jove on Pelops, or the milky road! Bright locks, Love's golden snare! these falling low, Those playing wanton o'er the graceful brow! Cheeks too, more winning sweet than after shower Adonis turn'd to Flora's favourite flower! Yield, heroines, yield, and ye who shared the embrace Of Jupiter in ancient times, give place! Give place, ye turban'd fair of Persia's coast! And ye, not less renown'd, Assyria's boast! Submit, ye nymphs of Greece! ye, once the bloom Of Ilion! and all ye, of haughty Rome, Who swept, of old, her theatres with trains Redundant, and still live in classic strains! To British damsels beauty's palm is due; Aliens! to follow them is fame for you. Oh city, founded by Dardanian hands, Whose towering front the circling realms commands, Too blest abode! no loveliness we see In all the earth, but it abounds in thee. The virgin multitude that daily meets, Radiant with gold and beauty, in thy streets, Outnumbers all her train of starry fires, With which Diana gilds thy lofty spires. Fame says, that wafted hither by her doves, With all her host of quiver-bearing loves, Venus, preferring Paphian scenes no more, Has fix'd her empire on thy nobler shore. But lest the sightless boy inforce my stay, I leave these happy walls, while yet I may. Immortal Moly shall secure my heart From all the sorcery of Circæan art, And I will even repass Cam's reedy pools To face once more the warfare of the schools. Meantime accept this trifle! rhymes though few, Yet such, as prove thy friend's remembrance true! ELEGY II. ON THE DEATH OF THE UNIVERSITY BEADLE AT CAMBRIDGE. COMPOSED BY MILTON IN THE SEVENTEENTH YEAR OF HIS AGE. Thee, whose refulgent staff, and summons clear, Minerva's flock long time was wont to obey, Although thyself an herald, famous here, The last of heralds, Death, has snatch'd away. He calls on all alike, nor even deigns To spare the office that himself sustains. Thy locks were whiter than the plumes display'd By Leda's paramour in ancient time, But thou wast worthy ne'er to have decay'd, Or Æson-like to know a second prime, Worthy, for whom some goddess should have won New life, oft kneeling to Apollo's son. Commission'd to convene, with hasty call, The gowned tribes, how graceful wouldst thou stand! So stood Cyllenius erst in Priam's hall, Wing-footed messenger of Jove's command; And so Eurybates, when he address'd To Peleus' son, Atrides' proud behest. Dread queen of sepulchres! whose rigorous laws And watchful eyes run through the realms below, Oh, oft too adverse to Minerva's cause, Too often to the Muse not less a foe, Chuse meaner marks, and with more equal aim Pierce useless drones, earth's burthen and its shame! Flow, therefore, tears for him, from every eye, All ye disciples of the Muses, weep! Assembling, all, in robes of sable dye, Around his bier, lament his endless sleep; And let complaining elegy rehearse, In every school, her sweetest, saddest verse. ELEGY III. ON THE DEATH OF THE BISHOP OF WINCHESTER. COMPOSED IN THE AUTHOR'S SEVENTEENTH YEAR. Silent I sat, dejected, and alone, Making in thought, the public woes my own, When, first, arose the image in my breast Of England's suffering by that scourge, the Pest! How Death, his funeral torch and scythe in hand, Entering the lordliest mansions of the land, Has laid the gem-illumined palace low, And levell'd tribes of nobles at a blow. I, next, deplored the famed paternal pair, Too soon to ashes turn'd, and empty air! The heroes next, whom snatch'd into the skies, All Belgia saw, and follow'd with her sighs; But thee far most I mourn'd, regretted most, Winton's chief shepherd, and her worthiest boast! Pour'd out in tears I thus complaining said: “Death, next in power to him who rules the dead! Is't not enough that all the woodlands yield To thy fell force, and every verdant field, That lilies, at one noisome blast of thine, And even the Cyprian queen's own roses, pine, That oaks themselves, although the running rill Suckle their roots, must wither at thy will, That all the winged nations, even those Whose heaven-directed flight the future shows, And all the beasts, that in dark forests stray, And all the herds of Proteus are thy prey. Ah envious! arm'd with powers so unconfined! Why stain thy hands with blood of human kind? Why take delight, with darts, that never roam, To chase a heaven-born spirit from her home?” While thus I mourn'd, the star of evening stood, Now newly risen above the western flood, And Phœbus from his morning goal again Had reach'd the gulfs of the Iberian main. I wish'd repose, and on my couch reclined, Took early rest, to night and sleep resign'd: When—Oh for words to paint what I beheld! I seem'd to wander in a spacious field, Where all the champaign glow'd with purple light Like that of sun-rise on the mountain height; Flowers over all the field, of every hue That ever Iris wore, luxuriant grew. Nor Chloris, with whom amorous zephyrs play, E'er dress'd Alcinous' garden half so gay. A silver current, like the Tagus, roll'd O'er golden sands, but sands of purer gold; With dewy airs Favonius fann'd the flowers, With airs awaken'd under rosy bowers; Such, poets feign, irradiate all o'er The sun's abode on India's utmost shore. While I, that splendour and the mingled shade Of fruitful vines, with wonder fixt survey'd, At once, with looks that beam'd celestial grace, The seer of Winton stood before my face. His snowy vesture's hem descending low His golden sandals swept, and pure as snow New-fallen shone the mitre on his brow. Where'er he trod a tremulous sweet sound Of gladness shook the flowery scene around: Attendant angels clap their starry wings, The trumpet shakes the sky, all ether rings, Each chants his welcome, folds him to his breast, And thus a sweeter voice than all the rest: “Ascend, my son! thy father's kingdom share! My son! henceforth be freed from every care!” So spake the voice, and at its tender close With psaltry's sound the angelic band arose; Then night retired, and chased by dawning day The visionary bliss pass'd all away. I mourn'd my banish'd sleep, with fond concern; Frequent to me may dreams like this return! ELEGY IV. TO HIS TUTOR, THOMAS YOUNG, CHAPLAIN TO THE ENGLISH FACTORY AT HAMBURGH. WRITTEN IN THE AUTHOR'S SEVENTEENTH YEAR. Hence my epistle—skim the deep—fly o'er Yon smooth expanse to the Teutonic shore! Haste—lest a friend should grieve for thy delay, And the gods grant, that nothing thwart thy way! I will myself invoke the king, who binds, In his Sicanian echoing vault, the winds, With Doris and her nymphs, and all the throng Of azure gods, to speed thee safe along. But rather to ensure thy happier haste, Ascend Medea's chariot, if thou may'st; Or that, whence young Triptolemus of yore Descended, welcome on the Scythian shore. The sands, that line the German coast, descried, To opulent Hamburga turn aside! So called, if legendary fame be true, From Hama, whom a club-arm'd Cimbrian slew. There lives, deep-learn'd and primitively just, A faithful steward of his Christian trust, My friend, and favourite inmate of my heart, That now is forced to want its better part. What mountains now, and seas, alas, how wide! From me this other, dearer self divide, Dear, as the sage renown'd for moral truth To the prime spirit of the Attic youth; Dear, as the Stagyrite to Ammon's son, His pupil, who disdain'd the world he won; Nor so did Chiron, or so Phœnix shine In young Achilles' eyes, as he in mine. First led by him through sweet Aonian shade, Each sacred haunt of Pindus I survey'd; And favour'd by the muse, whom I implored, Thrice on my lip the hallow'd stream I pour'd. But thrice the sun's resplendent chariot roll'd To Aries, has new-tinged his fleece with gold, And Chloris twice has dress'd the meadows gay, And twice has summer parch'd their bloom away, Since last delighted on his looks I hung, Or my ear drank the music of his tongue: Fly, therefore, and surpass the tempest's speed; Aware thyself, that there is urgent need! Him, entering, thou shalt haply seated see Beside his spouse, his infants on his knee; Or turning, page by page, with studious look, Some bulky father, or God's holy book; Or ministering (which is his weightiest care) To Christ's assembled flock their heavenly fare. Give him, whatever his employment be, Such gratulation, as he claims, from me; And, with a down-cast eye, and carriage meek, Addressing him, forget not thus to speak! “If, compass'd round with arms thou canst attend To verse, verse greets thee from a distant friend. Long due, and late, I left the English shore; But make me welcome for that cause the more! Such from Ulysses, his chaste wife to cheer, The slow epistle came, though late, sincere. But wherefore this? why palliate I the deed, For which the culprit's self could hardly plead? Self-charged, and self-condemn'd, his proper part He feels neglected, with an aching heart; But thou forgive! delinquents, who confess, And pray forgiveness, merit anger less; From timid foes the lion turns away, Nor yawns upon or rends a crouching prey; Even pike-wielding Thracians learn to spare, Won by soft influence of a suppliant prayer; And Heaven's dread thunderbolt arrested stands By a cheap victim, and uplifted hands. Long had he wish'd to write, but was withheld, And, writes at last, by love alone compell'd; For fame, too often true when she alarms, Reports thy neighbouring fields a scene of arms; Thy city against fierce besiegers barr'd, And all the Saxon chiefs for fight prepared. Enyo wastes thy country wide around, And saturates with blood the tainted ground; Mars rests contented in his Thrace no more, But goads his steeds to fields of German gore, The ever verdant olive fades and dies, And Peace, the trumpet-hating goddess, flies, Flies from that earth which justice long had left, And leaves the world of its last guard bereft. “Thus horror girds thee round. Meantime alone Thou dwell'st, and helpless in a soil unknown; Poor, and receiving from a foreign hand The aid denied thee in thy native land. Oh, ruthless country, and unfeeling more Than thy own billow-beaten chalky shore! Leavest thou to foreign care the worthies, given By Providence, to guide thy steps to heaven? His ministers, commission'd to proclaim Eternal blessings in a Saviour's name? Ah then most worthy, with a soul unfed, In Stygian night to lie for ever dead! So once the venerable Tishbite stray'd An exiled fugitive from shade to shade, When, flying Ahab, and his fury wife, In lone Arabian wilds, he shelter'd life; So, from Philippa, wander'd forth forlorn Cilician Paul, with sounding scourges torn; And Christ himself, so left, and trod no more, The thankless Gergesene's forbidden shore. “But thou take courage! strive against despair! Quake not with dread, nor nourish anxious care! Grim war indeed on every side appears, And thou art menaced by a thousand spears; Yet none shall drink thy blood, or shall offend Even the defenceless bosom of my friend. For thee the ægis of thy God shall hide, Jehovah's self shall combat on thy side. The same, who vanquish'd under Sion's towers At silent midnight, all Assyria's powers; The same, who overthrew in ages past Damascus' sons that laid Samaria waste! Their king he fill'd and them with fatal fears By mimic sounds of clarions in their ears, Of hoofs, and wheels, and neighings from afar, Of clashing armour, and the din of war. “Thou, therefore, (as the most afflicted may,) Still hope, and triumph o'er thy evil day! Look forth, expecting happier times to come, And to enjoy, once more, thy native home!” ELEGY V. ON THE APPROACH OF SPRING. WRITTEN IN THE AUTHOR'S TWENTIETH YEAR. Time, never wandering from his annual round, Bids Zephyr breathe the spring, and thaw the ground; Bleak winter flies, new verdure clothes the plain, And earth assumes her transient youth again. Dream I, or also to the spring belong Increase of genius, and new powers of song? Spring gives them, and, how strange soe'er it seems, Impels me now to some harmonious themes. Castalia's fountain, and the forked hill By day, by night, my raptured fancy fill; My bosom burns and heaves, I hear within A sacred sound that prompts me to begin. Lo! Phœbus comes, with his bright hair he blends The radiant laurel wreath; Phœbus descends; I mount, and, undepress'd by cumberous clay, Through cloudy regions win my easy way; Rapt through poetic shadowy haunts I fly; The shrines all open to my dauntless eye, My spirit searches all the realms of light, And no Tartarean gulfs elude my sight. But this ecstatic trance—this glorious storm Of inspiration—what will it perform? Spring claims the verse, that with his influence glows, And shall be paid with what himself bestows. Thou, veil'd with opening foliage, lead'st the throng Of feather'd minstrels, Philomel! in song; Let us, in concert, to the season sing, Civic and silvan heralds of the Spring! With notes triumphant Spring's approach declare! To Spring, ye Muses, annual tribute bear! The Orient left and Æthiopia's plains, The Sun now northward turns his golden reins; Night creeps not now, yet rules with gentle sway, And drives her dusky horrors swift away; Now less fatigued, on this ethereal plain Boötes follows his celestial wain; And now the radiant sentinels above, Less numerous, watch around the courts of Jove, For, with the night, force, ambush, slaughter fly, And no gigantic guilt alarms the sky. Now haply says some shepherd, while he views, Recumbent on a rock, the reddening dews, This night, this surely, Phœbus miss'd the fair, Who stops his chariot by her amorous care. Cynthia, delighted by the morning's glow, Speeds to the woodland, and resumes her bow; Resigns her beams, and, glad to disappear, Blesses his aid, who shortens her career. Come—Phœbus cries—Aurora come—too late Thou linger'st, slumbering, with thy wither'd mate! Leave him, and to Hymettus's top repair! Thy darling Cephalus expects thee there. The goddess, with a blush, her love betrays, But mounts, and driving rapidly, obeys. Earth now desires thee, Phœbus! and to engage Thy warm embrace, casts off the guise of age; Desires thee, and deserves; for who so sweet, When her rich bosom courts thy genial heat? Her breath imparts to every breeze that blows, Arabia's harvest, and the Paphian rose. Her lofty front she diadems around With sacred pines, like Ops on Ida crown'd; Her dewy locks with various flowers new-blown, She interweaves, various, and all her own, For Proserpine, in such a wreath attired, Tænarian Dis himself with love inspired. Fear not, lest, cold and coy, the nymph refuse! Herself, with all her sighing Zephyrs sues; Each courts thee, fanning soft his scented wing, And all her groves with warbled wishes ring. Nor, unendow'd and indigent, aspires The amorous Earth to engage thy warm desires, But, rich in balmy drugs, assists thy claim, Divine Physician! to that glorious name. If splendid recompense, if gifts can move Desire in thee, (gifts often purchase love,) She offers all the wealth her mountains hide, And all that rests beneath the boundless tide. How oft, when headlong from the heavenly steep, She sees thee playing in the western deep, How oft she cries—“Ah Phœbus! why repair Thy wasted force, why seek refreshment there? Can Tethys win thee? wherefore shouldst thou lave A face so fair in her unpleasant wave? Come, seek my green retreats, and rather chuse To cool thy tresses in my crystal dews, The grassy turf shall yield thee sweeter rest; Come, lay thy evening glories on my breast, And breathing fresh, through many a humid rose, Soft whispering airs shall lull thee to repose! No fears I feel like Semele to die, Nor let thy burning wheels approach too nigh, For thou canst govern them; here therefore rest, And lay thy evening glories on my breast!” Thus breathes the wanton Earth her amorous flame, And all her countless offspring feel the same; For Cupid now through every region strays, Brightening his faded fires with solar rays; His new-strung bow sends forth a deadlier sound, And his new-pointed shafts more deeply wound; Nor Dian's self escapes him now untried, Nor even Vesta at her altar-side; His mother too repairs her beauty's wane, And seems sprung newly from the deep again. Exulting youths the Hymeneal sing, With Hymen's name roofs, rocks, and vallies ring; He, new-attired, and by the season drest, Proceeds, all fragrant, in his saffron vest. Now, many a golden-cinctured virgin roves To taste the pleasures of the fields and groves, All wish, and each alike, some favourite youth Hers, in the bonds of Hymeneal truth. Now pipes the shepherd through his reeds again, Nor Phillis wants a song, that suits the strain; With songs the seaman hails the starry sphere, And dolphins rise from the abyss to hear; Jove feels himself the season, sports again With his fair spouse, and banquets all his train. Now too the Satyrs, in the dusk of eve, Their mazy dance through flowery meadows weave, And neither god nor goat, but both in kind, Silvanus, wreath'd with cypress, skips behind. The Dryads leave their hollow silvan cells To roam the banks and solitary dells; Pan riots now, and from his amorous chafe Ceres and Cybele seem hardly safe; And Faunus, all on fire to reach the prize, In chase of some enticing Oread flies, She bounds before, but fears too swift a bound, And hidden lies, but wishes to be found. Our shades entice the Immortals from above, And some kind power presides o'er every grove; And long, ye powers, o'er every grove preside, For all is safe and blest, where ye abide! Return, O Jove! the age of gold restore— Why choose to dwell, where storms and thunder roar? At least, thou, Phœbus! moderate thy speed! Let not the vernal hours too swift proceed, Command rough Winter back, nor yield the pole Too soon to Night's encroaching long controul! ELEGY VI. TO CHARLES DEODATI, Who, while he spent his Christmas in the country, sent the Author a poetical Epistle, in which he requested that his verses, if not so good as usual, might be excused on account of the many feasts to which his friends invited him, and which would not allow him leisure to finish them as he wished. With no rich viands overcharged, I send Health, which perchance you want, my pamper'd friend; But wherefore should thy muse tempt mine away From what she loves, from darkness into day? Art thou desirous to be told how well I love thee, and in verse? verse cannot tell, For verse has bounds, and must in measure move; But neither bounds nor measure knows my love. How pleasant, in thy lines described, appear December's harmless sports, and rural cheer! French spirits kindling with cerulean fires, And all such gambols as the time inspires! Think not that wine against good verse offends; The Muse and Bacchus have been always friends, Nor Phœbus blushes sometimes to be found With ivy, rather than with laurel, crown'd. The Nine themselves ofttimes have join'd the song And revels of the Bacchanalian throng; Not even Ovid could in Scythian air Sing sweetly—why? no vine would flourish there. What in brief numbers sung Anacreon's muse? Wine, and the rose, that sparkling wine bedews. Pindar with Bacchus glows;—his every line Breathes the rich fragrance of inspiring wine, While, with loud crash o'erturn'd, the chariot lies And brown with dust the fiery courser flies. The Roman lyrist steep'd in wine his lays So sweet in Glycera's and Chloe's praise. Now too the plenteous feast and mantling bowl Nourish the vigour of thy sprightly soul; The flowing goblet makes thy numbers flow, And casks not wine alone, but verse bestow. Thus Phœbus favours, and the arts attend, Whom Bacchus, and whom Ceres, both befriend: What wonder then, thy verses are so sweet, In which these triple powers so kindly meet? The lute now also sounds, with gold in-wrought, And touch'd, with flying fingers, nicely taught, In tapestried halls high roof'd, the sprightly lyre Directs the dancers of the virgin choir. If dull repletion fright the Muse away, Sights, gay as these, may more invite her stay: And, trust me, while the ivory keys resound, Fair damsels sport, and perfumes steam around, Apollo's influence, like ethereal flame, Shall animate, at once, thy glowing frame, And all the Muse shall rush into thy breast, By love and music's blended powers possest. For numerous powers light Elegy befriend, Hear her sweet voice, and at her call attend; Her, Bacchus, Ceres, Venus, all approve, And, with his blushing mother, gentle Love. Hence to such bards we grant the copious use Of banquets, and the vine's delicious juice. But they, who demi-gods and heroes praise, And feats perform'd in Jove's more youthful days, Who now the counsels of high heaven explore, Now shades, that echo the Cerberean roar, Simply let these, like him of Samos, live, Let herbs to them a bloodless banquet give; In beechen goblets let their beverage shine, Cool from the crystal spring, their sober wine! Their youth should pass in innocence, secure From stain licentious, and in manners pure, Pure as the priest, when robed in white he stands, The fresh lustration ready in his hands. Thus Linus lived, and thus, as poets write, Tiresias, wiser for his loss of sight; Thus exiled Chalcas, thus the bard of Thrace, Melodious tamer of the savage race; Thus train'd by temperance, Homer led, of yore, His chief of Ithaca from shore to shore, Through magic Circe's monster-peopled reign, And shoals insidious with the siren train; And through the realms where grizly spectres dwell, Whose tribes he fetter'd in a gory spell; For these are sacred bards, and, from above, Drink large infusions from the mind of Jove. Would'st thou, (perhaps 'tis hardly worth thine ear,) Would'st thou be told my occupation here? The promised King of peace employs my pen, The eternal covenant made for guilty men, The new-born Deity with infant cries Filling the sordid hovel, where he lies: The hymning Angels, and the herald star, That led the Wise, who sought him from afar, And idols on their own unhallow'd shore Dash'd, at his birth, to be revered no more! This theme on reeds of Albion I rehearse: The dawn of that blest day inspired the verse; Verse, that, reserved in secret, shall attend Thy candid voice, my critic, and my friend! ELEGY VII. COMPOSED IN THE AUTHOR'S NINETEENTH YEAR. As yet a stranger to the gentle fires, That Amathusia's smiling queen inspires, Not seldom I derided Cupid's darts, And scorn'd his claim to rule all human hearts. “Go, child,” I said, “transfix the timorous dove! An easy conquest suits an infant love; Enslave the sparrow, for such prize shall be Sufficient triumph to a chief like thee! Why aim thy idle arms at human kind? Thy shafts prevail not 'gainst the noble mind.” The Cyprian heard, and, kindling into ire, (None kindles sooner,) burn'd with double fire. It was the spring, and newly risen day Peep'd o'er the hamlets on the first of May; My eyes too tender for the blaze of light, Still sought the shelter of retiring night, When Love approach'd, in painted plumes array'd, The insidious god his rattling darts betray'd, Nor less his infant features, and the sly Sweet intimations of his threatening eye. Such the Sigeian boy is seen above, Filling the goblet for imperial Jove; Such he, on whom the nymphs bestow'd their charms, Hylas, who perish'd in a Naiad's arms. Angry he seem'd, yet graceful in his ire, And added threats, not destitute of fire. “My power,” he said, “by other's pain alone, 'Twere best to learn; now learn it by thy own! With those who feel my power that power attest, And in thy anguish be my sway confest! I vanquish'd Phœbus, though returning vain From his new triumph o'er the Python slain, And, when he thinks on Daphne, even he Will yield the prize of archery to me. A dart less true the Parthian horseman sped, Behind him kill'd, and conquer'd as he fled: Less true the expert Cydonian, and less true The youth whose shaft his latent Procris slew. Vanquish'd by me see huge Orion bend, By me Alcides, and Alcides' friend. At me should Jove himself a bolt design, His bosom first should bleed transfixt by mine. But all thy doubts this shaft will best explain, Nor shall it reach thee with a trivial pain, Thy Muse, vain youth! shall not thy peace ensure, Nor Phœbus' serpent yield thy wound a cure.” He spoke, and, waving a bright shaft in air, Sought the warm bosom of the Cyprian fair. That thus a child should bluster in my ear, Provoked my laughter, more than moved my fear. I shunn'd not, therefore, public haunts, but stray'd Careless in city or suburban shade, And passing, and repassing, nymphs, that moved With grace divine, beheld where'er I roved. Bright shone the vernal day, with double blaze, As beauty gave new force to Phœbus' rays. By no grave scruples check'd, I freely eyed The dangerous show, rash youth my only guide, And many a look of many a fair unknown Met full, unable to controul my own. But one I mark'd (then peace forsook my breast) One—oh how far superior to the rest! What lovely features! such the Cyprian queen Herself might wish, and Juno wish her mien. The very nymph was she, whom when I dared His arrows, Love had even then prepared; Nor was himself remote, nor unsupplied With torch well-trimm'd and quiver at his side; Now to her lips he clung, her eye-lids now, Then settled on her cheeks, or on her brow; And with a thousand wounds from every part Pierced, and transpierced, my undefended heart. A fever, new to me, of fierce desire Now seized my soul, and I was all on fire, But she, the while, whom only I adore, Was gone, and vanish'd, to appear no more. In silent sadness I pursue my way; I pause, I turn, proceed, yet wish to stay, And while I follow her in thought, bemoan With tears, my soul's delight so quickly flown. When Jove had hurl'd him to the Lemnian coast, So Vulcan sorrow'd for Olympus lost, And so Oeclides, sinking into night, From the deep gulf look'd up to distant light. Wretch that I am, what hopes for me remain, Who cannot cease to love, yet love in vain? Oh could I once, once more behold the fair, Speak to her, tell her, of the pangs I bear, Perhaps she is not adamant, would show Perhaps some pity at my tale of woe. Oh inauspicious flame!—'tis mine to prove A matchless instance of disastrous love. Ah spare me, gentle power!—If such thou be, Let not thy deeds and nature disagree; Spare me, and I will worship at no shrine With vow and sacrifice, save only thine. Now I revere thy fires, thy bow, thy darts, Now own thee sovereign of all human hearts. Remove! no—grant me still this raging woe! Sweet is the wretchedness that lovers know: But pierce hereafter (should I chance to see One destined mine) at once both her and me. Such were the trophies, that, in earlier days, By vanity seduced, I toil'd to raise, Studious, yet indolent, and urged by youth, That worst of teachers! from the ways of truth; Till learning taught me, in his shady bower, To quit love's servile yoke, and spurn his power. Then, on a sudden, the fierce flame supprest, A frost continual settled on my breast, Whence Cupid fears his flames extinct to see, And Venus dreads a Diomede in me. EPIGRAMS. ON THE INVENTOR OF GUNS. Praise in old times the sage Prometheus won, Who stole æthereal radiance from the sun; But greater he, whose bold invention strove To emulate the fiery bolts of Jove. [The Poems on the subject of the Gunpowder Treason I have not translated, both because the matter of them is unpleasant, and because they are written with an asperity, which, however it might be warranted in Milton's day, would be extremely unseasonable now.] C. TO LEONORA SINGING AT ROME I have translated only two of the three poetical compliments addressed to Leonora, as they appear to me far superior to what I have omitted. C.. Another Leonora once inspired Tasso, with fatal love to frenzy fired; But how much happier, lived he now, were he, Pierced with whatever pangs for love of thee! Since could he hear that heavenly voice of thine, With Adriana's lute of sound divine, Fiercer than Pentheus' though his eye might roll, Or idiot apathy benumb his soul, You still, with medicinal sounds might cheer His senses wandering in a blind career; And sweetly breathing through his wounded breast, Charm, with soul-soothing song, his thoughts to rest. TO THE SAME. [TO LEONORA]. Naples, too credulous, ah! boast no more The sweet-voiced Siren buried on thy shore, That, when Parthenope deceased, she gave Her sacred dust to a Chalcidic grave, For still she lives, but has exchanged the hoarse Pausilipo for Tiber's placid course, Where, idol of all Rome, she now in chains, Of magic song, both gods and men detains. THE COTTAGER AND HIS LANDLORD. A FABLE. A peasant to his lord paid yearly court, Presenting pippins, of so rich a sort That he, displeased to have a part alone, Removed the tree, that all might be his own. The tree, too old to travel, though before So fruitful, wither'd, and would yield no more. The 'squire, perceiving all his labour void, Cursed his own pains, so foolishly employ'd. And “Oh,” he cried, “that I had lived content With tribute, small indeed, but kindly meant! My avarice has expensive proved to me, Has cost me both my pippins, and my tree.” TO CHRISTINA, QUEEN OF SWEDEN, WITH CROMWELL'S PICTURE. Christina, maiden of heroic mien! Star of the North! of northern stars the queen! Behold what wrinkles I have earn'd, and how The iron casque still chafes my veteran brow, While following fate's dark footsteps, I fulfil The dictates of a hardy people's will. But soften'd, in thy sight, my looks appear, Not to all Queens or Kings alike severe. MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. ON THE DEATH OF THE VICE-CHANCELLOR, A PHYSICIAN. Learn, ye nations of the earth, The condition of your birth; Now be taught your feeble state; Know, that all must yield to fate! If the mournful rover, Death, Say but once—“Resign your breath!” Vainly of escape you dream, You must pass the Stygian stream. Could the stoutest overcome Death's assault, and baffle doom, Hercules had both withstood, Undiseased by Nessus' blood. Ne'er had Hector press'd the plain By a trick of Pallas slain, Nor the chief to Jove allied By Achilles' phantom died. Could enchantments life prolong, Circe, saved by magic song, Still had lived, and equal skill Had preserved Medea still. Dwelt in herbs, and drugs, a power To avert man's destined hour, Learn'd Machaon should have known Doubtless to avert his own. Chiron had survived the smart Of the Hydra-tainted dart, And Jove's bolt had been, with ease, Foil'd by Asclepiades. Thou too, sage! of whom forlorn Helicon and Cirrha mourn, Still hadst fill'd thy princely place, Regent of the gowned race; Hadst advanced to higher fame Still, thy much-ennobled name, Nor in Charon's skiff explored The Tartarean gulf abhorr'd. But resentful Proserpine, Jealous of thy skill divine, Snapping short thy vital thread, Thee too number'd with the dead. Wise and good! untroubled be The green turf, that covers thee! Thence, in gay profusion, grow All the sweetest flowers that blow! Pluto's consort bid thee rest! Æacus pronounce thee blest, To her home thy shade consign, Make Elysium ever thine! ON THE DEATH OF THE BISHOP OF ELY. WRITTEN IN THE AUTHOR'S SEVENTEENTH YEAR. My lids with grief were tumid yet, And still my sullied cheek was wet With briny tears, profusely shed For venerable Winton dead; When Fame, whose tales of saddest sound, Alas! are ever truest found, The news through all our cities spread Of yet another mitred head By ruthless fate to death consign'd, Ely, the honour of his kind! At once, a storm of passion heaved My boiling bosom; much I grieved, But more I raged, at every breath Devoting Death himself to death. With less revenge did Naso teem, When hated Ibis was his theme; With less, Archilochus, denied The lovely Greek, his promised bride. But lo! while thus I execrate, Incensed, the minister of fate, Wondrous accents, soft, yet clear, Wafted on the gale I hear. “Ah, much deluded! lay aside Thy threats, and anger misapplied! Art not afraid with sounds like these To offend, where thou canst not appease? Death is not (wherefore dream'st thou thus?) The son of Night and Erebus; Nor was of fell Erynnis born On gulfs where Chaos rules forlorn: But, sent from God, his presence leaves, To gather home his ripen'd sheaves, To call encumber'd souls away From fleshly bonds to boundless day, (As when the winged hours excite, And summon forth the morning-light) And each to convoy to her place Before the Eternal Father's face. But not the wicked;—them, severe Yet just, from all their pleasures here He hurries to the realms below, Terrific realms of penal woe! Myself no sooner heard his call, Than, 'scaping through my prison-wall, I bade adieu to bolts and bars, And soar'd, with angels, to the stars, Like him of old, to whom 'twas given To mount, on fiery wheels, to heaven. Boötes' waggon, slow with cold, Appall'd me not; nor to behold The sword, that vast Orion draws, Or even the Scorpion's horrid claws. Beyond the Sun's bright orb I fly, And, far beneath my feet, descry Night's dread goddess, seen with awe, Whom her winged dragons draw. Thus, ever wondering at my speed, Augmented still as I proceed, I pass the planetary sphere, The Milky Way—and now appear Heaven's crystal battlements, her door Of massy pearl, and emerald floor. But here I cease. For never can The tongue of once a mortal man In suitable description trace The pleasures of that happy place; Suffice it, that those joys divine Are all, and all for ever, mine!” NATURE UNIMPAIRED BY TIME. Ah, how the human mind wearies herself With her own wanderings, and, involved in gloom Impenetrable, speculates amiss! Measuring, in her folly, things divine By human; laws inscribed on adamant By laws of man's device, and counsels fixt For ever, by the hours that pass and die. How?—shall the face of nature then be plough'd Into deep wrinkles, and shall years at last On the great Parent fix a sterile curse? Shall even she confess old age, and halt And, palsy-smitten, shake her starry brows? Shall foul Antiquity with rust and drought, And Famine, vex the radiant worlds above? Shall Time's unsated maw crave and ingulf The very heavens, that regulate his flight? And was the Sire of all able to fence His works, and to uphold the circling worlds, But, through improvident and heedless haste, Let slip the occasion?—so then—all is lost— And in some future evil hour, yon arch Shall crumble and come thundering down, the poles Jar in collision, the Olympian king Fall with his throne, and Pallas, holding forth The terrors of the Gorgon shield in vain, Shall rush to the abyss, like Vulcan hurl'd Down into Lemnos, through the gate of heaven. Thou also, with precipitated wheels, Phœbus! thy own son's fall shalt imitate, With hideous ruin shalt impress the deep Suddenly, and the flood shall reek, and hiss, At the extinction of the lamp of day. Then too shall Hæmus, cloven to his base, Be shatter'd, and the huge Ceraunian hills, Once weapons of Tartarean Dis, immersed In Erebus, shall fill himself with fear. No. The Almighty Father surer laid His deep foundations, and providing well For the event of all, the scales of Fate Suspended in just equipoise, and bade His universal works, from age to age, One tenour hold, perpetual, undisturb'd. Hence the prime mover wheels itself about Continual, day by day, and with it bears In social measure swift the heavens around. Not tardier now is Saturn than of old, Nor radiant less the burning casque of Mars. Phœbus, his vigour unimpair'd, still shows The effulgence of his youth, nor needs the god A downward course, that he may warm the vales; But ever rich in influence, runs his road, Sign after sign, through all the heavenly zone. Beautiful, as at first, ascends the star From odoriferous Ind, whose office is To gather home betimes the ethereal flock, To pour them o'er the skies again at eve, And to discriminate the night and day. Still Cynthia's changeful horn waxes, and wanes, Alternate, and with arms extended still, She welcomes to her breast her brother's beams. Nor have the elements deserted yet Their functions: thunder, with as loud a stroke As erst, smites through the rocks, and scatters them. The east still howls, still the relentless north Invades the shuddering Scythian, still he breathes The winter, and still rolls the storms along. The king of ocean, with his wonted force, Beats on Pelorus; o'er the deep is heard The hoarse alarm of Triton's sounding shell; Nor swim the monsters of the Ægean sea In shallows, or beneath diminish'd waves. Thou too, thy ancient vegetative power Enjoy'st, O Earth! Narcissus still is sweet, And, Phœbus! still thy favourite, and still Thy favourite, Cytherea! both retain Their beauty; nor the mountains, ore-enrich'd For punishment of man, with purer gold Teem'd ever, or with brighter gems the deep. Thus, in unbroken series, all proceeds; And shall, till wide involving either pole, And the immensity of yonder heaven, The final flames of destiny absorb The world, consumed in one enormous pyre! ON THE PLATONIC IDEA, AS IT WAS UNDERSTOOD BY ARISTOTLE. Ye sister powers, who o'er the sacred groves Preside, and thou, fair mother of them all, Mnemosyne! and thou, who in thy grot Immense, reclined at leisure, hast in charge The archives, and the ordinances of Jove, And dost record the festivals of heaven, Eternity!—inform us who is He, That great original by nature chosen To be the archetype of human kind, Unchangeable, immortal, with the poles Themselves coeval, one, yet every where, An image of the god who gave him being? Twin-brother of the goddess born from Jove, He dwells not in his father's mind, but, though Of common nature with ourselves, exists Apart, and occupies a local home. Whether, companion of the stars, he spend Eternal ages, roaming at his will From sphere to sphere the tenfold heavens; or dwell On the moon's side that nearest neighbours earth; Or torpid on the banks of Lethe sit Among the multitude of souls ordain'd To flesh and blood, or whether (as may chance) That vast and giant model of our kind In some far distant region of this globe Sequester'd stalk, with lifted head on high O'ertowering Atlas, on whose shoulders rest The stars, terrific even to the gods. Never the Theban seer, whose shoulders rest The stars, terrific even to the gods. Never the Theban seer, whose blindness proved His best illumination, him beheld In secret vision; never him the son Of Pleione, amid the noiseless night Descending, to the prophet-choir reveal'd; Him never knew the Assyrian priest, who yet The ancestry of Ninus chronicles, And Belus, and Osiris, far-renown'd; Nor even thrice great Hermes, although skill'd So deep in mystery, to the worshippers Of Isis show'd a prodigy like him. And thou, who hast immortalized the shades Of Academus, if the schools received This monster of the fancy first from thee, Either recall at once the banish'd bards To thy republic, or thyself evinced A wilder fabulist, go also forth. TO HIS FATHER. Oh that Pieria's spring would through my breast Pour its inspiring influence, and rush No rill, but rather an o'erflowing flood! That, for my venerable Father's sake All meaner themes renounced, my muse, on wings Of duty borne, might reach a loftier strain. For thee, my Father! howsoe'er it please, She frames this slender work, nor know I aught That may thy gifts more suitably requite; Though to requite them suitably would ask Returns much nobler, and surpassing far The meagre stores of verbal gratitude: But, such as I possess, I send thee all. This page presents thee in their full amount With thy son's treasures, and the sum is nought; Nought, save the riches that from airy dream In secret grottos, and in laurel bowers, I have, by golden Clio's gift, acquired. Verse is a work divine; despise not thou Verse therefore, which evinces (nothing more) Man's heavenly source, and which, retaining still Some scintillations of Promethean fire, Bespeaks him animated from above. The Gods love verse; the infernal Powers themselves Confess the influence of verse, which stirs The lowest deep, and binds in triple chains Of adamant both Pluto and the Shades. In verse the Delphic priestess, and the pale Tremulous Sibyl, make the future known, And he who sacrifices, on the shrine Hangs verse, both when he smites the threatening bull And when he spreads his reeking entrails wide To scrutinize the Fates enveloped there. We too, ourselves, what time we seek again Our native skies, and one eternal now Shall be the only measure of our being, Crown'd all with gold, and chanting to the lyre Harmonious verse, shall range the courts above, And make the starry firmament resound. And, even now, the fiery spirit pure That wheels yon circling orbs, directs, himself, Their mazy dance with melody of verse Unutterable, immortal, hearing which Huge Ophiuchus holds his hiss suppress'd, Orion soften'd, drops his ardent blade, And Atlas stands unconscious of his load. Verse graced of old the feasts of kings, ere yet Luxurious dainties, destined to the gulf Immense of gluttony, were known, and ere Lyæus deluged yet the temperate board. Then sat the bard, a customary guest To share the banquet, and his length of locks With beechen honours bound, proposed in verse The characters of heroes and their deeds To imitation, sang of Chaos old, Of nature's birth, of gods that crept in search Of acorns fallen, and of the thunder-bolt Not yet produced from Etna's fiery cave. And what avails, at last, tune without voice, Devoid of matter? Such may suit perhaps The rural dance, but such was ne'er the song Of Orpheus, whom the streams stood still to hear, And the oaks follow'd. Not by chords alone Well touch'd, but by resistless accents more To sympathetic tears the ghosts themselves He moved: these praises to his verse he owes. Nor thou persist, I pray thee, still to slight The sacred Nine, and to imagine vain And useless, Powers, by whom inspired, thyself Art skilful to associate verse with airs Harmonious, and to give the human voice A thousand modulations, heir by right Indisputable of Arion's fame. Now say, what wonder is it, if a son Of thine delight in verse, if so conjoin'd In close affinity, we sympathize In social arts, and kindred studies sweet? Such distribution of himself to us Was Phœbus' choice; thou hast thy gift, and I Mine also, and between us we receive, Father and son, the whole inspiring God. No! howsoe'er the semblance thou assume Of hate, thou hatest not the gentle Muse, My Father! for thou never badest me tread The beaten path, and broad, that leads right on To opulence, nor didst condemn thy son To the insipid clamours of the bar, To laws voluminous, and ill observed; But, wishing to enrich me more, to fill My mind with treasure, led'st me far away From city din to deep retreats, to banks And streams Aonian, and, with free consent, Didst place me happy at Apollo's side. I speak not now, on more important themes Intent, of common benefits, and such As nature bids, but of thy larger gifts, My Father! who, when I had open'd once The stores of Roman rhetoric, and learn'd The full-toned language of the eloquent Greeks, Whose lofty music graced the lips of Jove, Thyself didst counsel me to add the flowers That Gallia boasts; those too with which the smooth Italian his degenerate speech adorns, That witnesses his mixture with the Goth; And Palestine's prophetic songs divine. To sum the whole, whate'er the heaven contains, The earth beneath it, and the air between, The rivers and the restless deep, may all Prove intellectual gain to me, my wish Concurring with thy will; science herself, All cloud removed, inclines her beauteous head, And offers me the lip, if, dull of heart, I shrink not, and decline her gracious boon. Go now and gather dross, ye sordid minds, That covet it; what could my Father more? What more could Jove himself, unless he gave His own abode, the heaven in which he reigns? More eligible gifts than these were not Apollo's to his son, had they been safe, As they were insecure, who made the boy The world's vice-luminary, bade him rule The radiant chariot of the day, and bind To his young brows his own all-dazzling wreath. I therefore, although last and least, my place Among the learned in the laurel grove Will hold, and where the conqueror's ivy twines, Henceforth exempt from the unletter'd throng Profane, nor even to be seen by such. Away then, sleepless Care, Complaint away, And, Envy, with thy “jealous leer malign!” Nor let the monster Calumny shoot forth Her venom'd tongue at me. Detested foes! Ye all are impotent against my peace, For I am privileged, and bear my breast Safe, and too high for your viperean wound. But thou, my Father! since to render thanks Equivalent, and to requite by deeds Thy liberality, exceeds my power, Suffice it, that I thus record thy gifts, And bear them treasured in a grateful mind! Ye too, the favourite pastime of my youth, My voluntary numbers, if ye dare To hope longevity, and to survive Your master's funeral, not soon absorb'd In the oblivious Lethæan gulf, Shall to futurity perhaps convey This theme, and by these praises of my sire Improve the Fathers of a distant age! TO SALSILLUS, A ROMAN POET, MUCH INDISPOSED. The original is written in a measure called Scazon, which signifies limping, and the measure is so denominated, because, though in other respects Iambic, it terminates with a Spondee, and has consequently a more tardy movement. The reader will immediately see that this property of the Latin verse cannot be imitated in English. My halting Muse, that dragg'st by choice along Thy slow, slow step, in melancholy song, And likest that pace, expressive of thy cares, Not less than Deiopea's sprightlier airs, When, in the dance, she beats, with measured tread, Heaven's floor, in front of Juno's golden bed; Salute Salsillus, who to verse divine Prefers, with partial love, such lays as mine. Thus writes that Milton then, who wafted o'er From his own nest, on Albion's stormy shore, Where Eurus, fiercest of the Æolian band, Sweeps, with ungovern'd rage, the blasted land, Of late to more serene Ausonia came To view her cities of illustrious name, To prove, himself a witness of the truth, How wise her elders, and how learn'd her youth. Much good, Salsillus! and a body free From all disease, that Milton asks for thee, Who now endurest the languor, and the pains, That bile inflicts, diffused through all thy veins, Relentless malady! not moved to spare By thy sweet Roman voice, and Lesbian air! Health, Hebe's sister, sent us from the skies, And thou, Apollo, whom all sickness flies, Pythius, or Pæan, or what name divine Soe'er thou choose, haste, heal a priest of thine! Ye groves of Faunus, and ye hills, that melt With vinous dews, where meek Evander dwelt, If aught salubrious in your confines grow, Strive which shall soonest heal your poet's woe, That, render'd to the Muse he loves, again He may enchant the meadows with his strain. Numa, reclined in everlasting ease, Amid the shade of dark embowering trees, Viewing with eyes of unabated fire His loved Ægeria, shall that strain admire: So soothed, the tumid Tiber shall revere The tombs of kings, nor desolate the year, Shall curb his waters with a friendly reign, And guide them harmless, till they meet the main. TO GIOVANNI BATTISTA MANSO, MARQUIS OF VILLA. MILTON'S ACCOUNT OF MANSO. Giovanni Battista Manso, Marquis of Villa, is an Italian nobleman of the highest estimation among his countrymen, for genius, literature, and military accomplishments. To him Torquato Tasso addressed his Dialogues on Friendship, for he was much the friend of Tasso, who has also celebrated him among the other princes of his country, in his poem entitled Gerusalemme Conquistata, book xx. Fra cavalieri magnanimi, e cortesi, Risplende il Manso. During the author's stay at Naples, he received at the hands of the Marquis a thousand kind offices and civilities, and, desirous not to appear ungrateful, sent him this poem a short time before his departure from that city. These verses also to thy praise the Nine, Oh Manso! happy in that theme design, For Gallus, and Mæcenas gone, they see None such besides, or whom they love as thee; And if my verse may give the meed of fame, Thine too shall prove an everlasting name. Already such, it shines in Tasso's page, (For thou wast Tasso's friend,) from age to age, And, next, the Muse consign'd, (not unaware How high the charge,) Marino to thy care, Who, singing, to the nymphs, Adonis' praise, Boasts thee the patron of his copious lays. To thee alone the poet would entrust His latest vows, to thee alone his dust; And thou with punctual piety hast paid, In labour'd brass, thy tribute to his shade. Nor this contented thee,—but lest the grave Should aught absorb of theirs, which thou couldst save, All future ages thou hast deign'd to teach The life, lot, genius, character of each, Eloquent as the Carian sage, who true To his great theme, the life of Homer drew. I, therefore, though a stranger youth, who come Chill'd by rude blasts, that freeze my northern home, Thee dear to Clio, confident proclaim, And thine, for Phœbus' sake, a deathless name. Nor thou, so kind, wilt view with scornful eye A Muse scarce rear'd beneath our sullen sky, Who fears not, indiscreet as she is young, To seek in Latium hearers of her song. We too, where Thames with his unsullied waves The tresses of the blue-hair'd Ocean laves, Hear oft by night, or slumbering seem to hear, O'er his wide stream, the swan's voice warbling clear, And we could boast a Tityrus of yore, Who trod, a welcome guest, your happy shore. Yes, dreary as we own our northern clime, Even we to Phœbus raise the polish'd rhyme. We too serve Phœbus; Phœbus has received (If legends old may claim to be believed,) No sordid gifts from us, the golden ear, The burnish'd apple, ruddiest of the year, The fragrant crocus, and to grace his fane, Fair damsels chosen from the Druid train; Druids, our native bards in ancient time, Who gods and heroes praised in hallow'd rhyme. Hence, often as the maids of Greece surround Apollo's shrine with hymns of festive sound, They name the virgins, who arrived of yore, With British off'rings, on the Delian shore; Loxo, from giant Corineus sprung, Upis, on whose blest lips the future hung, And Hecaerge, with the golden hair, All deck'd with Pictish hues, and all with bosoms bare. Thou, therefore, happy sage, whatever clime Shall ring with Tasso's praise in after-time, Or with Marino's, shalt be known their friend, And with an equal flight to fame ascend. The world shall hear how Phœbus and the Nine Were inmates once, and willing guests of thine. Yet Phœbus, when of old constrain'd to roam The earth, an exile from his heavenly home, Enter'd, no willing guest, Admetus' door, Though Hercules had ventured there before. But gentle Chiron's cave was near, a scene Of rural peace, clothed with perpetual green, And thither, oft as respite he required From rustic clamours loud, the god retired. There, many a time, on Peneus' bank reclined At some oak's root, with ivy thick entwined, Won by his hospitable friend's desire, He soothed his pains of exile with the lyre. Then shook the hills, then trembled Peneus' shore, Nor Oeta felt his load of forests more; The upland elms descended to the plain, And soften'd lynxes wonder'd at the strain. Well may we think, O dear to all above! Thy birth distinguish'd by the smile of Jove, And that Apollo shed his kindliest power, And Maia's son, on that propitious hour, Since only minds so born can comprehend A poet's worth, or yield that worth a friend. Hence, on thy yet unfaded cheek appears The lingering freshness of thy greener years; Hence, in thy front and features we admire Nature unwither'd and a mind entire. Oh might so true a friend to me belong, So skill'd to grace the votaries of song, Should I recall hereafter into rhyme The kings and heroes of my native clime, Arthur the chief, who even now prepares, In subterraneous being, future wars, With all his martial knights, to be restored, Each to his seat, around the federal board, And oh, if spirit fail me not, disperse Our Saxon plunderers, in triumphant verse! Then, after all, when, with the past content, A life I finish, not in silence spent, Should he, kind mourner, o'er my death-bed bend, I shall but need to say—“Be yet my friend!” He, too, perhaps, shall bid the marble breathe To honour me, and with the graceful wreath Or of Parnassus, or the Paphian isle, Shall bind my brows,—but I shall rest the while. Then also, if the fruits of Faith endure, And Virtue's promised recompense be sure, Borne to those seats, to which the blest aspire By purity of soul, and virtuous fire, These rites, as Fate permits, I shall survey With eyes illumined by celestial day, And, every cloud from my pure spirit driven, Joy in the bright beatitude of Heaven! ON THE DEATH OF DAMON. THE ARGUMENT. Thyrsis and Damon, shepherds and neighbours, had always pursued the same studies, and had, from their earliest days, been united in the closest friendship. Thyrsis, while travelling for improvement, received intelligence of the death of Damon, and, after a time, returning and finding it true, deplores himself, and his solitary condition, in this poem. By Damon is to be understood Charles Deodati, connected with the Italian city of Lucca by his father's side, in other respects an Englishman; a youth of uncommon genius, erudition, and virtue. Ye nymphs of Himera, (for ye have shed Erewhile for Daphnis, and for Hylas dead, And over Bion's long-lamented bier, The fruitless meed of many a sacred tear,) Now through the villas laved by Thames, rehearse The woes of Thyrsis in Sicilian verse, What sighs he heaved, and how with groans profound He made the woods, and hollow rocks resound, Young Damon dead; nor even ceased to pour His lonely sorrows at the midnight hour. The green wheat twice had nodded in the ear, And golden harvest twice enrich'd the year, Since Damon's lips had gasp'd for vital air The last, last time, nor Thyrsis yet was there; For he, enamour'd of the Muse, remain'd In Tuscan Fiorenza long detain'd, But, stored at length with all he wish'd to learn, For his flock's sake now hasted to return; And when the shepherd had resumed his seat At the elm's root, within his old retreat, Then 'twas his lot, then, all his loss to know, And, from his burthen'd heart, he vented thus his woe. “Go, seek your home, my lambs; my thoughts are due To other cares, than those of feeding you. Alas! what deities shall I suppose In heaven, or earth, concern'd for human woes, Since, oh my Damon! their severe decree So soon condemns me to regret of thee! Depart'st thou thus, thy virtues unrepaid With fame and honour, like a vulgar shade? Let him forbid it, whose bright rod controls And separates sordid from illustrious souls, Drive far the rabble, and to thee assign A happier lot, with spirits worthy thine! “Go, seek your home, my lambs; my thoughts are due To other cares, than those of feeding you. Whate'er befall, unless by cruel chance The wolf first give me a forbidding glance, Thou shalt not moulder undeplored, but long Thy praise shall dwell on every shepherd's tongue; To Daphnis first they shall delight to pay, And, after him, to thee the votive lay, While Pales shall the flocks and pastures love, Or Faunus to frequent the field or grove, At least, if ancient piety and truth, With all the learned labours of thy youth, May serve thee aught, or to have left behind A sorrowing friend, and of the tuneful kind. “Go, seek your home, my lambs; my thoughts are due To other cares, than those of feeding you. Yes, Damon! such thy sure reward shall be; But ah, what doom awaits unhappy me? Who now my pains and perils shall divide, As thou wast wont, for ever at my side, Both when the rugged frost annoy'd our feet, And when the herbage all was parch'd with heat; Whether the grim wolf's ravage to prevent, Or the huge lion's, arm'd with darts we went? Whose converse, now, shall calm my stormy day, With charming song, who now beguile my way? “Go, seek your home, my lambs; my thoughts are due To other cares, than those of feeding you. In whom shall I confide? whose counsel find A balmy medicine for my troubled mind? Or whose discourse, with innocent delight, Shall fill me now and cheat the wintry night, While hisses on my hearth the pulpy pear, And blackening chestnuts start and crackle there, While storms abroad the dreary meadows whelm, And the wind thunders through the neighbouring elm? “Go, seek your home, my lambs; my thoughts are due To other cares, than those of feeding you. Or who, when summer suns their summit reach, And Pan sleeps hidden by the sheltering beech, When shepherds disappear, nymphs seek the sedge, And the stretch'd rustic snores beneath the hedge, Who then shall render me thy pleasant vein Of Attic wit, thy jests, thy smiles again? “Go, seek your home, my lambs; my thoughts are due To other cares, than those of feeding you. Where glens and vales are thickest overgrown With tangled boughs, I wander now alone, Till night descend, while blustering wind and shower Beat on my temples through the shatter'd bower. “Go, seek your home, my lambs; my thoughts are due To other cares, than those of feeding you. Alas! what rampant weeds now shame my fields, And what a mildew'd crop the furrow yields! My rambling vines, unwedded to the trees, Bear shrivell'd grapes, my myrtles fail to please, Nor please me more my flocks; they, slighted, turn Their unavailing looks on me, and mourn. “Go, seek your home, my lambs; my thoughts are due To other cares, than those of feeding you. Ægon invites me to the hazel grove, Amyntas, on the river's bank to rove, And young Alphesibœus to a seat Where branching elms exclude the mid-day heat. ‘Here fountains spring,—here mossy hillocks rise; Here Zephyr whispers, and the stream replies.’ Thus each persuades, but, deaf to every call, I gain the thickets, and escape them all. “Go, seek your home, my lambs; my thoughts are due To other cares, than those of feeding you. Then Mopsus said, (the same who reads so well The voice of birds, and what the stars foretell, For he by chance had noticed my return,) ‘What means thy sullen mood, this deep concern? Ah Thyrsis! thou art either crazed with love, Or some sinister influence from above; Dull Saturn's influence oft the shepherds rue; His leaden shaft oblique has pierced thee through.’ “Go, go, my lambs, unpastured as ye are, My thoughts are all now due to other care. The nymphs amazed, my melancholy see, And ‘Thyrsis!’ cry, ‘what will become of thee? What would'st thou, Thyrsis? such should not appear The brow of youth, stern, gloomy, and severe; Brisk youth should laugh, and love,—ah shun the fate Of those, twice wretched mopes! who love too late!’ “Go, go, my lambs, unpastured as ye are, My thoughts are all now due to other care. Ægle with Hyas came to soothe my pain, And Baucis' daughter, Dryope the vain, Fair Dryope, for voice and finger neat Known far and near, and for her self-conceit; Chloris too came, whose cottage on the lands, That skirt the Idumanian current, stands; But all in vain they came, and but to see Kind words, and comfortable, lost on me. “Go, go, my lambs, unpastured as ye are, My thoughts are all now due to other care. Ah blest indifference of the playful herd, None by his fellow chosen, or preferr'd! No bonds of amity the flocks enthrall, But each associates, and is pleased with all; So graze the dappled deer in numerous droves, And all his kind alike the zebra loves; The same law governs where the billows roar, And Proteus' shoals o'erspread the desert shore; The sparrow, meanest of the feather'd race, His fit companion finds in every place, With whom he picks the grain that suits him best, Flirts here and there, and late returns to rest, And whom if chance the falcon make his prey, Or hedger with his well-aim'd arrow slay, For no such loss the gay survivor grieves; New love he seeks, and new delight receives. We only, an obdurate kind, rejoice, Scorning all others in a single choice. We scarce in thousands meet one kindred mind, And if the long-sought good at last we find, When least we fear it. Death our treasure steals, And gives our heart a wound, that nothing heals. “Go, go, my lambs, unpastured as ye are; My thoughts are all now due to other care. Ah, what delusion lured me from my flocks, To traverse Alpine snows and rugged rocks! What need so great had I to visit Rome, Now sunk in ruins, and herself a tomb? Or had she flourish'd still as when, of old, For her sake Tityrus forsook his fold, What need so great had I to incur a pause Of thy sweet intercourse for such a cause, For such a cause to place the roaring sea, Rocks, mountains, woods, between my friend and me? Else, had I grasp'd thy feeble hand, composed Thy decent limbs, thy drooping eyelids closed, And, at the last, had said—‘Farewell,—ascend,— Nor even in the skies forget thy friend!’ “Go, go, my lambs, untended homeward fare; My thoughts are all now due to other care. Although well pleased, ye tuneful Tuscan swains! My mind the memory of your worth retains, Yet not your worth can teach me less to mourn My Damon lost;—he too was Tuscan born, Born in your Lucca, city of renown! And wit possess'd, and genius, like your own. Oh how elate was I, when stretch'd beside The murmuring course of Arno's breezy tide, Beneath the poplar grove I pass'd my hours, Now cropping myrtles, and now vernal flowers, And hearing, as I lay at ease along, Your swains contending for the prize of song! I also dared attempt, (and, as it seems, Not much displeased attempting,) various themes, For even I can presents boast from you, The shepherd's pipe, and osier basket too, And Dati, and Francini, both have made My name familiar to the beechen shade, And they are learn'd, and each in every place Renown'd for song, and both of Lydian race. “Go, go, my lambs, untended homeward fare; My thoughts are all now due to other care. While bright the dewy grass with moon-beams shone, And I stood hurdling in my kids alone, How often have I said, (but thou hadst found Ere then thy dark cold lodgment under ground,) Now Damon sings, or springes sets for hares, Or wicker-work for various use prepares! How oft, indulging fancy, have I plann'd New scenes of pleasure, that I hoped at hand, Call'd thee abroad as I was wont, and cried, ‘What hoa! my friend,—come lay thy task aside, Haste, let us forth together, and beguile The heat beneath yon whispering shades awhile, Or on the margin stray of Colne's clear flood, Or where Cassibelan's grey turrets stood! There thou shalt cull me simples, and shalt teach Thy friend the name and healing powers of each, From the tall blue-bell to the dwarfish weed, What the dry land and what the marshes breed, For all their kinds alike to thee are known, And the whole art of Galen is thy own.’ Ah, perish Galen's art, and wither'd be The useless herbs that gave not health to thee! Twelve evenings since, as in poetic dream I meditating sat some statelier theme, The reeds no sooner touch'd my lip, though new, And unessay'd before, than wide they flew, Bursting their waxen bands, nor could sustain The deep-toned music of the solemn strain; And I am vain perhaps, but I will tell How proud a theme I choose,—ye groves, farewell! “Go, go, my lambs, untended homeward fare; My thoughts are all now due to other care. Of Brutus, Dardan chief, my song shall be, How with his barks he plough'd the British sea, First from Rutupia's towering headland seen, And of his consort's reign, fair Imogen; Of Brennus and Belinus, brothers bold, And of Arviragus, and how of old Our hardy sires the Armorican controll'd, And of the wife of Gorloïs, who, surprised By Uther, in her husband's form disguised, (Such was the force of Merlin's art,) became Pregnant with Arthur of heroic fame. These themes I now revolve,—and oh—if Fate Porportion to these themes my lengthen'd date, Adieu my shepherd's reed! yon pine-tree bough Shall be thy future home; there dangle thou Forgotten and disused, unless ere long Thou change thy Latian for a British song; A British?—even so,—the powers of man Are bounded; little is the most he can: And it shall well suffice me, and shall be Fame, and proud recompense enough for me, If Usa, golden-hair'd, my verse may learn, If Alain bending o'er his crystal urn, Swift-whirling Abra, Trent's o'ershadow'd stream, Thames, lovelier far than all in my esteem, Tamar's ore-tinctured flood, and, after these, The wave-worn shores of utmost Orcades. “Go, go, my lambs, untended homeward fare; My thoughts are all now due to other care. All this I kept in leaves of laurel-rind Enfolded safe, and for thy view design'd, This, and a gift from Manso's hand beside, (Manso, not least his native city's pride,) Two cups, that radiant as their giver shone, Adorn'd by sculpture with a double zone. The spring was graven there; here slowly wind The Red-sea shores with groves of spices lined; Her plumes of various hues amid the boughs The sacred, solitary Phœnix shows, And watchful of the dawn, reverts her head, To see Aurora leave her watery bed.— In other part, the expansive vault above, And there too, even there, the god of love; With quiver arm'd he mounts, his torch displays A vivid light, his gem-tipt arrows blaze, Around his bright and fiery eyes he rolls, Nor aims at vulgar minds, or little souls, Nor deigns one look below, but aiming high Sends every arrow to the lofty sky; Hence forms divine, and minds immortal, learn The power of Cupid, and enamour'd burn. “Thou also Damon, (neither need I fear That hope delusive,) thou art also there; For whither should simplicity like thine Retire? where else such spotless virtue shine? Thou dwell'st not (thought profane) in shades below, Nor tears suit thee;—cease then my tears to flow! Away with grief, on Damon ill bestow'd! Who, pure himself, has found a pure abode, Has pass'd the showery arch, henceforth resides With saints and heroes, and from flowing tides Quaffs copious immortality and joy, With hallow'd lips!—Oh! blest without alloy, And now enrich'd, with all that faith can claim, Look down, entreated by whatever name, If Damon please thee most (that rural sound Shall oft with echoes fill the groves around), Or if Diodatus, by which alone In those ethereal mansions thou art known. Thy blush was maiden, and thy youth the taste Of wedded bliss knew never, pure and chaste, The honours, therefore, by divine decree The lot of virgin worth, are given to thee; Thy brows encircled with a radiant band, And the green palm-branch waving in thy hand, Thou in immortal nuptials shalt rejoice, And join with seraphs thy according voice, Where rapture reigns, and the ecstatic lyre Guides the blest orgies of the blazing quire.” AN ODE ADDRESSED TO MR. JOHN ROUSE, LIBRARIAN OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD. ON A LOST VOLUME OF MY POEMS, WHICH HE DESIRED ME TO REPLACE, THAT HE MIGHT ADD THEM TO MY OTHER WORKS DEPOSITED IN THE LIBRARY. This Ode is rendered without rhime, that it might more adequately represent the original, which, as Milton himself informs us, is of no certain measure. It may possibly for this reason disappoint the reader, though it cost the writer more labour than the translation of any other piece in the whole collection. STROPHE. My twofold book! single in show, But double in contents, Neat, but not curiously adorn'd, Which, in his early youth, A poet gave, no lofty one in truth, Although an earnest wooer of the Muse— Say while in cool Ausonian shades, Or British wilds he roam'd, Striking by turns his native lyre, By turns the Daunian lute, And stepp'd almost in air,— ANTISTROPHE. Say, little book, what furtive hand Thee from thy fellow-books convey'd, What time, at the repeated suit Of my most learned friend, I sent thee forth, an honour'd traveller, From our great city to the source of Thames, Cærulean sire; Where rise the fountains, and the raptures ring Of the Aonian choir, Durable as yonder spheres, And through the endless lapse of years Secure to be admired? STROPHE II. Now what god, or demigod, For Britain's ancient genius moved (If our afflicted land Have expiated at length the guilty sloth Of her degenerate sons) Shall terminate our impious feuds, And discipline, with hallow'd voice, recall? Recall the Muses too, Driven from their ancient seats In Albion, and well nigh from Albion's shore, And with keen Phœbean shafts Piercing the unseemly birds, Whose talons menace us, Shall drive the harpy race from Helicon afar? ANTISTROPHE. But thou, my book, though thou hast stray'd, Whether by treachery lost, Or indolent neglect, thy bearer's fault, From all thy kindred books, To some dark cell, or cave forlorn, Where thou endurest, perhaps, The chafing of some hard untutor'd hand, Be comforted— For lo! again the splendid hope appears That thou may'st yet escape The gulfs of Lethe, and on oary wings Mount to the everlasting courts of Jove! STROPHE III. Since Rouse desires thee, and complains That though by promise his, Thou yet appear'st not in thy place Among the literary noble stores, Given to his care, But, absent, leavest his numbers incomplete. He, therefore, guardian vigilant Of that unperishing wealth, Calls thee to the interior shrine, his charge, Where he intends a richer treasure far Than Iön kept (Iön, Erectheus' son Illustrious, of the fair Creüsa born) In the resplendent temple of his god, Tripods of gold, and Delphic gifts divine. ANTISTROPHE. Haste, then, to the pleasant groves, The Muses' favourite haunt; Resume thy station in Apollo's dome. Dearer to him Than Delos, or the fork'd Parnassian hill! Exulting go, Since now a splendid lot is also thine, And thou art sought by my propitious friend; For there thou shalt be read With authors of exalted note, The ancient glorious lights of Greece and Rome. EPODE. Ye then, my works, no longer vain, And worthless deem'd by me! Whate'er this steril genius has produced Expect, at last, the rage of envy spent, An unmolested happy home, Gift of kind Hermes, and my watchful friend; Where never flippant tongue profane Shall entrance find, And whence the coarse unletter'd multitude Shall babble far remote. Perhaps some future distant age, Less tinged with prejudice and better taught, Shall furnish minds of power To judge more equally. Then, malice silenced in the tomb, Cooler heads and sounder hearts, Thanks to Rouse, if aught of praise I merit, shall with candour weigh the claim. Translations of the Italian Poems. SONNET. [Fair Lady! whose harmonious name the Rhine] Fair Lady! whose harmonious name the Rhine, Through all his grassy vale, delights to hear, Base were indeed the wretch, who could forbear To love a spirit elegant as thine, That manifests a sweetness all divine, Nor knows a thousand winning acts to spare, And graces, which Love's bow and arrows are, Tempering thy virtues to a softer shine. When gracefully thou speak'st, or singest gay, Such strains, as might the senseless forest move, Ah then—turn each his eyes and ears away, Who feels himself unworthy of thy love! Grace can alone preserve him, ere the dart Of fond desire yet reach his inmost heart. SONNET. [As on a hill-top rude, when closing day] As on a hill-top rude, when closing day Imbrowns the scene, some pastoral maiden fair Waters a lovely foreign plant with care, Borne from its native genial airs away, That scarcely can its tender bud display, So, on my tongue these accents, new and rare, Are flowers exotic, which Love waters there, While thus, O sweetly scornful! I essay Thy praise, in verse to British ears unknown, And Thames exchange for Arno's fair domain; So Love has will'd, and ofttimes Love has shown That what he wills, he never wills in vain. Oh that this hard and steril breast might be To Him, who plants from heaven, a soil as free! CANZONE. They mock my toil—the nymphs and amorous swains— And whence this fond attempt to write, they cry, Love-songs in language that thou little know'st? How darest thou risk to sing these foreign strains? Say truly,—find'st not oft thy purpose cross'd, And that thy fairest flowers here fade and die? Then with pretence of admiration high— Thee other shores expect, and other tides; Rivers, on whose grassy sides Her deathless laurel leaf, with which to bind Thy flowing locks, already Fame provides; Why then this burthen, better far declined? Speak, Muse! for me.—The fair one said, who guides My willing heart, and all my fancy's flights, “This is the language in which Love delights.” SONNET. TO CHARLES DIODATI. Charles—and I say it wondering—thou must know That I, who once assumed a scornful air, And scoff'd at Love, am fallen in his snare. (Full many an upright man has fallen so.) Yet think me not thus dazzled by the flow Of golden locks, or damask cheek; more rare The heart-felt beauties of my foreign fair, A mien majestic, with dark brows that show The tranquil lustre of a lofty mind; Words exquisite of idioms more than one, And song, whose fascinating power might bind, And from her sphere draw down the labouring Moon, With such fire-darting eyes, that should I fill My ears with wax, she would enchant me still. SONNET. [Lady! it cannot be, but that thine eyes] Lady! it cannot be, but that thine eyes Must be my sun, such radiance they display, And strike me even as Phœbus him, whose way Through horrid Libya's sandy desert lies. Meantime, on that side steamy vapours rise Where most I suffer. Of what kind are they, New as to me they are, I cannot say, But deem them, in the lover's language—sighs. Some, though with pain, my bosom close conceals, Which, if in part escaping thence, they tend To soften thine, thy coldness soon congeals. While others to my tearful eyes ascend, Whence my sad nights in showers are ever drown'd, Till my Aurora come, her brow with roses bound. SONNET. [Enamour'd, artless, young, on foreign ground] Enamour'd, artless, young, on foreign ground, Uncertain whither from myself to fly, To thee, dear Lady, with an humble sigh Let me devote my heart, which I have found By certain proofs, not few, intrepid, sound, Good, and addicted to conceptions high: When tempests shake the world, and fire the sky, It rests in adamant self-wrapt around, As safe from envy, and from outrage rude, From hopes and fears that vulgar minds abuse, As fond of genius and fixt fortitude, Of the resounding lyre, and every Muse. Weak you will find it in one only part, Now pierced by Love's immedicable dart. [TRANSLATIONS OF LATIN VERSES.] ÆNEID, BOOK VIII. LINE 18. TRANSLATION FROM VIRGIL. Thus Italy was moved;—nor did the chief Æneas in his mind less tumult feel. On every side his anxious thought he turns, Restless, unfix'd, not knowing what to choose. And as a cistern that in brim of brass Confines the crystal flood, if chance the sun Smite on it, or the moon's resplendent orb, The quivering light now flashes on the walls, Now leaps uncertain to the vaulted roof: Such were the wavering motions of his mind. 'Twas night—and weary nature sunk to rest; The birds, the bleating flocks, were heard no more. At length, on the cold ground, beneath the damp And dewy vault, fast by the river's brink, The father of his country sought repose. When lo! among the spreading poplar boughs, Forth from his pleasant stream, propitious rose The god of Tiber: clear transparent gauze Infolds his loins, his brows with reeds are crown'd; And these his gracious words to sooth his care: “Heaven-born, who bring'st our kindred home again Rescued, and giv'st eternity to Troy, Long have Laurentum and the Latian plains Expected thee; behold thy fix'd abode. Fear not the threats of war, the storm is pass'd, The gods appeased. For proof that what thou hear'st Is no vain forgery or delusive dream, Beneath the grove that borders my green bank, A milk-white swine, with thirty milk-white young, Shall greet thy wondering eyes. Mark well the place, For 'tis thy place of rest, there end thy toils: There, twice ten years elapsed, fair Alba's walls Shall rise, fair Alba, by Ascanius' hand. Thus shall it be;—now listen, while I teach The means to accomplish these events at hand. The Arcadians here, a race from Pallas sprung, Following Evander's standard and his fate, High on these mountains, a well chosen spot, Have built a city, for their grandsire's sake Named Pallenteum. These perpetual war Wage with the Latians: join'd in faithful league And arms confederate, add them to your camp. Myself between my winding banks will speed Your well-oar'd barks to stem the opposing tide. Rise, goddess-born, arise; and with the first Declining stars seek Juno in thy prayer, And vanquish all her wrath with suppliant vows. When conquest crowns thee, then remember me. I am the Tiber, whose cerulean stream Heaven favours; I with copious flood divide These grassy banks, and cleave the fruitful meads; My mansion this,—and lofty cities crown My fountain head.”—He spoke and sought the deep, And plunged his form beneath the closing flood. Æneas at the morning dawn awoke, And, rising, with uplifted eye beheld The orient sun, then dipp'd his palms, and scoop'd The brimming stream, and thus address'd the skies: “Ye nymphs, Laurentian nymphs, who feed the source Of many a stream, and thou, with thy blest flood, O Tiber! hear, accept me, and afford, At length afford, a shelter from my woes. Where'er in secret cavern under ground Thy waters sleep, where'er they spring to light, Since thou hast pity for a wretch like me, My offerings and my vows shall wait thee still: Great horned Father of Hesperian floods, Be gracious now, and ratify thy word!” He said, and chose two galleys from his fleet, Fits them with oars, and clothes the crew in arms. When lo! astonishing and pleasing sight, The milk-white dam, with her unspotted brood, Lay stretch'd upon the bank, beneath the grove. To thee, the pious Prince, Juno, to thee Devotes them all, all on thine altar bleed. That livelong night old Tiber smooth'd his flood, And so restrain'd it that it seem'd to stand Motionless as a pool, or silent lake, That not a billow might resist their oars. With cheerful sound of exhortation soon Their voyage they begin; the pitchy keel Slides through the gentle deep; the quiet stream Admires the unwonted burthen that it bears, Well polish'd arms, and vessels painted gay. Beneath the shade of various trees, between The umbrageous branches of the spreading groves, They cut their liquid way, nor day nor night They slack their course, unwinding as they go The long meanders of the peaceful tide. The glowing sun was in meridian height, When from afar they saw the humble walls, And the few scatter'd cottages, which now The Roman power has equall'd with the clouds; But such was then Evander's scant domain. They steer to shore, and hasten to the town. It chanced, the Arcadian monarch on that day, Before the walls, beneath a shady grove, Was celebrating high, in solemn feast, Alcides and his tutelary gods. Pallas, his son, was there, and there the chief Of all his youth; with these, a worthy tribe, His poor but venerable senate, burnt Sweet incense, and their altars smoked with blood. Soon as they saw the towering masts approach Sliding between the trees, while the crew rest Upon their silent oars, amazed they rose, Not without fear, and all forsook the feast. But Pallas undismay'd, his javelin seized, Rush'd to the bank, and from a rising ground Forbade them to disturb the sacred rites. “Ye stranger youth! what prompts you to explore This untried way? and whither do ye steer? Whence, and who are ye? Bring ye peace or war?” Æneas from his lofty deck holds forth The peaceful olive branch, and thus replies: “Trojans and enemies to the Latian state, Whom they with unprovoked hostilities Have driven away, thou seest. We seek Evander; Say this,—and say beside, the Trojan chiefs Are come, and seek his friendship and his aid.” Pallas with wonder heard that aweful name, And “whosoe'er thou art,” he cried, “come forth; Bear thine own tidings to my father's ear, And be a welcome guest beneath our roof.” He said, and press'd the stranger to his breast, Then led him from the river to the grove, Where, courteous, thus Æneas greets the king: “Best of the Grecian race, to whom I bow (So wills my fortune) suppliant, and stretch forth In sign of amity this peaceful branch, I fear'd thee not, although I knew thee well A Grecian leader, born in Arcady, And kinsman of the Atridæ. Me my virtue, That means no wrong to thee,—the Oracles, Our kindred families allied of old, And thy renown diffused through every land, Have all conspired to bind in friendship to thee, And send me not unwilling to thy shores. Dardanus, author of the Trojan state, (So say the Greeks,) was fair Electra's son; Electra boasted Atlas for her sire, Whose shoulders high sustain the æthereal orbs. Your sire is Mercury, whom Maia bore, Sweet Maia, on Cyllene's hoary top. Her, if we credit aught tradition old, Atlas of yore, the selfsame Atlas, claim'd His daughter. Thus united close in blood, Thy race and ours one common sire confess. With these credentials fraught, I would not send Ambassadors with artful phrase to sound And win thee by degrees, but came myself; Me, therefore, me thou seest; my life the stake: 'Tis I, Æneas, who implore thine aid. Should Daunia, that now aims the blow at thee, Prevail to conquer us, nought then, they think, Will hinder, but Hesperia must be theirs, All theirs, from the upper to the nether sea. Take then our friendship and return us thine! We too have courage, we have noble minds, And youth well tried and exercised in arms.” Thus spoke Æneas. He with fix'd regard Survey'd him speaking, features, form and mien. Then briefly thus,—“Thou noblest of thy name, How gladly do I take thee to my heart, How gladly thus confess thee for a friend! In thee I trace Anchises; his thy speech, Thy voice, thy countenance. For I well remember Many a day since, when Priam journey'd forth To Salamis, to see the land where dwelt Hesione, his sister, he push'd on E'en to Arcadia's frozen bounds. 'Twas then The bloom of youth was glowing on my cheek; Much I admired the Trojan chiefs, and much Their king, the son of great Laomedon, But most Anchises, towering o'er them all. A youthful longing seized me to accost The hero and embrace him; I drew near, And gladly led him to the walls of Pheneus. Departing, he distinguish'd me with gifts, A costly quiver stored with Lycian darts, A robe inwove with gold, with gold imboss'd Two bridles, those which Pallas uses now. The friendly league thou hast solicited I give thee therefore, and to-morrow all My chosen youth shall wait on your return. Meanwhile, since thus in friendship ye are come, Rejoice with us and join to celebrate These annual rites, which may not be delay'd, And be at once familiar at our board.” He said, and bade replace the feast removed; Himself upon a grassy bank disposed The crew; but for Æneas order'd forth A couch spread with a lion's tawny shag, And bade him share the honours of his throne. The appointed youth with glad alacrity Assist the labouring priest to load the board With roasted entrails of the slaughter'd beeves, Well-kneaded bread and mantling bowls. Well pleased, Æneas and the Trojan youth regale On the huge length of a well-pastured chine. Hunger appeased, and tables all dispatch'd, Thus spake Evander: “Superstition here, In this old solemn feasting, has no part. No, Trojan friend, from utmost danger saved, In gratitude this worship we renew. Behold that rock which nods above the vale, Those bulks of broken stone dispersed around; How desolate the shatter'd cave appears, And what a ruin spreads the incumber'd plain. Within this pile, but far within, was once The den of Cacus; dire his hateful form That shunn'd the day, half monster and half man. Blood newly shed stream'd ever on the ground Smoking, and many a visage pale and wan Nail'd at his gate, hung hideous to the sight. Vulcan begot the brute: vast was his size, And from his throat he belch'd his father's fires. But the day came that brought us what we wish'd, The assistance and the presence of a God. Flush'd with his victory and the spoils he won From triple-form'd Geryon lately slain, The great avenger, Hercules, appear'd. Hither he drove his stately bulls, and pour'd His herds along the vale. But the sly thief Cacus, that nothing might escape his hand Of villany or fraud, drove from the stalls Four of the lordliest of his bulls, and four, The fairest of his heifers; by the tail He dragg'd them to his den, that, there conceal'd, No footsteps might betray the dark abode. And now his herd with provender sufficed, Alcides would be gone: they as they went Still bellowing loud, made the deep-echoing woods And distant hills resound: when hark! one ox, Imprison'd close within the vast recess, Lows in return, and frustrates all his hope. Then fury seized Alcides, and his breast With indignation heaved: grasping his club Of knotted oak, swift to the mountain top He ran, he flew. Then first was Cacus seen To tremble, and his eyes bespoke his fears. Swift as an eastern blast he sought his den, And dread, increasing, wing'd him as he went. Drawn up in iron slings above the gate, A rock was hung enormous. Such his haste, He burst the chains, and dropp'd it at the door, Then grappled it with iron work within Of bolts and bars by Vulcan's art contrived. Scarce was he fast, when panting for revenge Came Hercules; he gnash'd his teeth with rage, And quick as lightning glanced his eyes around In quest of entrance. Fiery red and stung With indignation, thrice he wheel'd his course About the mountain; thrice, but thrice in vain, He strove to force the quarry at the gate, And thrice sat down o'erwearied in the vale. There stood a pointed rock, abrupt and rude, That high o'erlook'd the rest, close at the back Of the fell monster's den, where birds obscene Of ominous note resorted, choughs and daws. This, as it lean'd obliquely to the left, Threatening the stream below, he from the right Push'd with his utmost strength, and to and fro He shook the mass, loosening its lowest base, Then shoved it from its seat; down fell the pile; Sky thunder'd at the fall; the banks give way, The affrighted stream flows upward to his source. Behold the kennel of the brute exposed, The gloomy vault laid open. So, if chance Earth yawning to the centre should disclose The mansions, the pale mansions of the dead, Loathed by the gods, such would the gulf appear, And the ghosts tremble at the sight of day. The monster braying with unusual din Within his hollow lair, and sore amazed To see such sudden inroads of the light, Alcides press'd him close with what at hand Lay readiest, stumps of trees, and fragments huge Of millstone size. He, (for escape was none,) Wondrous to tell! forth from his gorge discharged A smoky cloud that darken'd all the den; Wreath after wreath he vomited amain, The smothering vapour mix'd with fiery sparks; No sight could penetrate the veil obscure. The hero, more provoked, endured not this, But with a headlong leap he rush'd to where The thickest cloud enveloped his abode; There grasp'd he Cacus, spite of all his fires, Till crush'd within his arms, the monster shows His bloodless throat, now dry with panting hard, And his press'd eyeballs start. Soon he tears down The barricade of rock, the dark abyss Lies open; and the imprison'd bulls, the theft He had with oaths denied, are brought to light; By the heels the miscreant carcass is dragg'd forth, His face, his eyes, all terrible, his breast Beset with bristles, and his sooty jaws Are view'd with wonder never to be cloy'd. Hence the celebrity thou seest, and hence This festal day. Potitius first enjoin'd Posterity these solemn rites, he first With those who bear the great Pinarian name To Hercules devoted, in the grove This altar built, deem'd sacred in the highest By us, and sacred ever to be deem'd. Come, then, my friends, and bind your youthful brows In praise of such deliverance, and hold forth The brimming cup; your deities and ours Are now the same, then drink, and freely too. So saying, he twisted round his reverend locks A variegated poplar wreath, and fill'd His right hand with a consecrated bowl. At once all pour libations on the board, All offer prayer. And now the radiant sphere Of day descending, eventide drew near. When first Potitius with the priests advanced, Begirt with skins, and torches in their hands. High piled with meats of savoury taste, they ranged The chargers, and renew'd the grateful feast. Then came the Salii, crown'd with poplar too, Circling the blazing altars; here the youth Advanced, a choir harmonious, there were heard The reverend seers responsive; praise they sung, Much praise in honour of Alcides' deeds; How first with infant gripe two serpents huge He strangled, sent from Juno; next they sung, How Troja and Oechalia he destroy'd, Fair cities both, and many a toilsome task Beneath Eurystheus, (so his stepdame will'd,) Achieved victorious. Thou, the cloud-born pair, Hylæus fierce and Pholus, monstrous twins, Thou slew'st the minotaur, the plague of Crete, And the vast lion of the Nemean rock; Thee Hell, and Cerberus, Hell's porter, fear'd, Stretch'd in his den upon his half-gnaw'd bones. Thee no abhorred form, not even the vast Typhœus could appal, though clad in arms. Hail, true born son of Jove, among the gods At length enroll'd, nor least illustrious thou, Haste thee propitious, and approve our songs!— Thus hymn'd the chorus; above all they sing The cave of Cacus, and the flames he breathed. The whole grove echoes, and the hills resound. The rites perform'd, all hasten to the town: The king, bending with age, held as he went Æneas and his Pallas by the hand, With much variety of pleasing talk Shortening the way. Æneas, with a smile, Looks round him, charm'd with the delightful scene, And many a question asks, and much he learns Of heroes far renown'd in ancient times. Then spake Evander: “These extensive groves Were once inhabited by fauns and nymphs Produced beneath their shades, and a rude race Of men, the progeny uncouth of elms And knotted oaks. They no refinement knew Of laws or manners civilized, to yoke The steer, with forecast provident to store The hoarded grain, or manage what they had, But browsed like beasts upon the leafy boughs, Or fed voracious on their hunted prey. An exile from Olympus, and expell'd His native realm by thunder-bearing Jove, First Saturn came. He from the mountains drew This herd of men untractable and fierce, And gave them laws, and call'd his hiding place This growth of forests, Latium. Such the peace His land possess'd, the golden age was then, So famed in story; till by slow degrees Far other times, and of far different hue, Succeeded, thirst of gold and thirst of blood. Then came Ausonian bands, and armed hosts From Sicily, and Latium often changed Her master and her name. At length arose Kings, of whom Tybris of gigantic form Was chief; and we Italians since have call'd The river by his name; thus Albula, (So was the country call'd in ancient days,) Was quite forgot. Me from my native land An exile, through the dangerous ocean driven, Resistless fortune and relentless fate, Placed where thou seest me. Phœbus, and The nymph Carmentis, with maternal care Attendant on my wanderings, fixed me here. [Ten lines omitted.] He said, and show'd him the Tarpeian rock, And the rude spot where now the capitol Stands all magnificent and bright with gold, Then overgrown with thorns. And yet even then The swains beheld that sacred scene with awe; The grove, the rock, inspired religious fear. This grove, he said, that crowns the lofty top Of this fair hill, some deity, we know, Inhabits, but what deity we doubt. The Arcadians speak of Jupiter himself, That they have often seen him, shaking here His gloomy ægis, while the thunder-storms Came rolling all around him. Turn thine eyes, Behold that ruin; those dismantled walls, Where once two towns, Ianiculum ?, By Janus this, and that by Saturn built, Saturnia. Such discourse brought them beneath The roof of poor Evander; thence they saw, Where now the proud and stately forum stands, The grazing herds wide scatter'd o'er the field. Soon as he enter'd—Hercules, he said, Victorious Hercules, on this threshold trod, These walls contain'd him, humble as they are. Dare to despise magnificence, my friend, Prove thy divine descent by worth divine, Nor view with haughty scorn this mean abode. So saying, he led Æneas by the hand, And placed him on a cushion stuff'd with leaves, Spread with the skin of a Lybistian bear. [The Episode of Venus and Vulcan has been omitted.] While thus in Lemnos Vulcan was employ'd Awaken'd by the gentle dawn of day, And the shrill song of birds beneath the eaves Of his low mansion, old Evander rose. His tunic, and the sandals on his feet, And his good sword well girded to his side, A panther's skin dependent from his left And over his right shoulder thrown aslant, Thus was he clad. Two mastiffs follow'd him, His whole retinue and his nightly guard. OVID. TRIST. LIB. V. ELEG. XII. Scribis, ut oblectem. You bid me write to amuse the tedious hours, And save from withering my poetic powers; Hard is the task, my friend, for verse should flow From the free mind, not fetter'd down by woe. Restless amidst unceasing tempests toss'd, Whoe'er has cause for sorrow, I have most. Would you bid Priam laugh, his sons all slain; Or childless Niobe from tears refrain, Join the gay dance, and lead the festive train? Does grief or study most befit the mind To this remote, this barbarous nook confined? Could you impart to my unshaken breast The fortitude by Socrates possess'd, Soon would it sink beneath such woes as mine, For what is human strength to wrath divine? Wise as he was, and Heaven pronounced him so, My sufferings would have laid that wisdom low. Could I forget my country, thee and all, And e'en the offence to which I owe my fall, Yet fear alone would freeze the poet's vein, While hostile troops swarm o'er the dreary plain. Add that the fatal rust of long disuse Unfits me for the service of the Muse. Thistles and weeds are all we can expect From the best soil impoverish'd by neglect; Unexercised, and to his stall confined, The fleetest racer would be left behind; The best built bark that cleaves the watery way, Laid useless by, would moulder and decay,— No hope remains that time shall me restore, Mean as I was, to what I was before. Think how a series of desponding cares Benumbs the genius and its force impairs. How oft, as now, on this devoted sheet, My verse constrain'd to move with measured feet, Reluctant and laborious limps along, And proves itself a wretched exile's song. What is it tunes the most melodious lays? 'Tis emulation and the thirst of praise, A noble thirst, and not unknown to me, While smoothly wafted on a calmer sea. But can a wretch like Ovid pant for fame? No, rather let the world forget my name. Is it because that world approved my strain, You prompt me to the same pursuit again? No, let the Nine the ungrateful truth excuse, I charge my hopeless ruin on the Muse, And, like Perillus, meet my just desert, The victim of my own pernicious art; Fool that I was to be so warn'd in vain, And shipwreck'd once, to tempt the deep again! Ill fares the bard in this unletter'd land, None to consult, and none to understand. The purest verse has no admirers here, Their own rude language only suits their ear. Rude as it is, at length familiar grown, I learn it, and almost unlearn my own;— Yet to say truth, even here the Muse disdains Confinement, and attempts her former strains, But finds the strong desire is not the power, And what her taste condemns, the flames devour. A part, perhaps, like this, escapes the doom, And though unworthy, finds a friend at Rome; But oh the cruel art, that could undo Its votary thus! would that could perish too! HOR. LIB. I. ODE IX. Vides, ut altâ stet nive candidum Soracte; ? Seest thou yon mountain laden with deep snow, The groves beneath their fleecy burthen bow, The streams, congeal'd, forget to flow; Come, thaw the cold, and lay a cheerful pile Of fuel on the hearth; Broach the best cask, and make old Winter smile With seasonable mirth. This be our part,—let Heaven dispose the rest; If Jove command, the winds shall sleep That now wage war upon the foamy deep, And gentle gales spring from the balmy west. Even let us shift to-morrow as we may, When to-morrow's pass'd away, We at least shall have to say, We have lived another day; Your auburn locks will soon be silver'd o'er, Old age is at our heels, and youth returns no more. HOR. LIB. I. ODE XXXVIII. Persicos odi, puer, apparatus. Boy, I hate their empty shows; Persian garlands I detest; Bring not me the late-blown rose, Lingering after all the rest. Plainer myrtle pleases me, Thus outstretch'd beneath my vine; Myrtle more becoming thee, Waiting with thy master's wine. ANOTHER VERSION OF THE SAME ODE. [LIB. I. ODE XXXVIII.] Boy! I detest all Persian fopperies, Fillet-bound garlands are to me disgusting; Task not thyself with any search, I charge thee, Where latest roses linger; Bring me alone, (for thou wilt find that readily,) Plain myrtle. Myrtle neither will disparage Thee occupied to serve me, or me drinking Beneath my vine's cool shelter. HOR. LIB. II. ODE XVI. Otium Divos rogat in patenti. Ease is the weary merchant's prayer, Who ploughs by night the Ægean flood, When neither moon nor stars appear, Or faintly glimmer through the cloud. For ease the Mede with quiver graced, For ease the Thracian hero sighs; Delightful ease all pant to taste, A blessing which no treasure buys. For neither gold can lull to rest, Nor all a Consul's guard beat off The tumults of a troubled breast, The cares that haunt a gilded roof. Happy the man whose table shows A few clean ounces of old plate, No fear intrudes on his repose, No sordid wishes to be great. Poor short lived things, what plans we lay! Ah, why forsake our native home, To distant climates speed away, For self sticks close where'er we roam! Care follows hard and soon o'ertakes The well rigg'd ship, the warlike steed; Her destined quarry ne'er forsakes; Not the wind flies with half her speed. From anxious fears of future ill Guard well the cheerful, happy now; Gild e'en your sorrows with a smile, No blessing is unmix'd below. Thy neighing steeds and lowing herds, Thy numerous flocks around thee graze, And the best purple Tyre affords Thy robe magnificent displays. On me indulgent Heaven bestow'd A rural mansion, neat and small; This lyre;—and as for yonder crowd, The happiness to hate them all. EPIGRAMS, TRANSLATED FROM THE LATIN OF OWEN. ON ONE IGNORANT AND ARROGANT. Thou mayst of double ignorance boast, Who know'st not, that thou nothing know'st. PRUDENT SIMPLICITY. That thou mayst injure no man, dove-like be, And serpent-like, that none may injure thee! TO A FRIEND IN DISTRESS. I wish thy lot, now bad, still worse, my friend; For when at worst, they say, things always mend. RETALIATION. The works of ancient bards divine, Aulus, thou scorn'st to read; And should posterity read thine, It would be strange indeed! [When little more than boy in age] When little more than boy in age, I deem'd myself almost a sage; But now seem worthier to be styled, For ignorance—almost a child. SUNSET AND SUNRISE. Contemplate, when the sun declines, Thy death, with deep reflection; And when again he rising shines, Thy day of resurrection! ON THE SHORTNESS OF HUMAN LIFE. BY DR. JORTIN. January, 1784. Suns that set, and moons that wane, Rise, and are restored again; Stars that orient day subdues, Night at her return renews. Herbs and flowers, the beauteous birth Of the genial womb of Earth, Suffer but a transient death From the winter's cruel breath. Zephyr speaks; serener skies Warm the glebe, and they arise. We, alas! Earth's haughty kings, We, that promise mighty things, Losing soon life's happy prime, Droop and fade in little time. Spring returns, but not our bloom; Still 'tis winter in the tomb. VERSES TO THE MEMORY OF DR. LLOYD, SPOKEN AT THE WESTMINSTER ELECTION NEXT AFTER HIS DECEASE. Our good old friend is gone, gone to his rest, Whose social converse was itself a feast. O ye of riper age, who recollect How once ye loved and eyed him with respect, Both in the firmness of his better day, While yet he ruled you with a father's sway, And when, impair'd by time and glad to rest, Yet still with looks in mild complacence drest, He took his annual seat and mingled here His sprightly vein with yours,—now drop a tear. In morals blameless as in manners meek, He knew no wish that he might blush to speak, But, happy in whatever state below, And richer than the rich in being so, Obtain'd the hearts of all, and such a meed At length from one, as made him rich indeed. Hence, then, ye titles, hence, not wanted here! Go, garnish merit in a brighter sphere, The brows of those whose more exalted lot He could congratulate, but envied not. Light lie the turf, good senior! on thy breast, And tranquil as thy mind was be thy rest! Though, living, thou hadst more desert than fame, And not a stone now chronicles thy name. TRANSLATIONS OF GREEK VERSES. FROM THE GREKK OF JULIANUS. A Spartan, his companion slain, Alone from battle fled; His mother, kindling with disdain That she had borne him, struck him dead; For courage, and not birth alone, In Sparta, testifies a son! ON THE SAME BY PALLAADAS. A Spartan 'scaping from the fight, His mother met him in his flight, Upheld a falchion to his breast, And thus the fugitive address'd: “Thou canst but live to blot with shame Indelible thy mother's name, While every breath that thou shalt draw Offends against thy country's law; But, if thou perish by this hand, Myself indeed throughout the land, To my dishonour, shall be known The mother still of such a son; But Sparta will be safe and free, And that shall serve to comfort me.” AN EPITAPH. [My name—my country—what are they to thee?] My name—my country—what are they to thee? What, whether base or proud my pedigree? Perhaps I far surpass'd all other men; Perhaps I fell below them all; what then? Suffice it, stranger! that thou seest a tomb; Thou know'st its use; it hides—no matter whom. ANOTHER [EPITAPH]. [Take to thy bosom, gentle Earth! a swain] Take to thy bosom, gentle Earth! a swain With much hard labour in thy service worn; He set the vines that clothe yon ample plain, And he these olives that the vale adorn. He fill'd with grain the glebe; the rills he led Through this green herbage, and those fruitful bowers; Thou, therefore, Earth! lie lightly on his head, His hoary head, and deck his grave with flowers. ANOTHER [EPITAPH]. [Painter, this likeness is too strong] Painter, this likeness is too strong, And we shall mourn the dead too long. ANOTHER [EPITAPH]. [At threescore winters' end I died] At threescore winters' end I died A cheerless being, sole and sad; The nuptial knot I never tied, And wish my father never had. BY CALLIMACHUS. At morn we placed on his funereal bier Young Melanippus; and at eventide, Unable to sustain a loss so dear, By her own hand his blooming sister died. Thus Aristippus mourn'd his noble race, Annihilated by a double blow, Nor son could hope, nor daughter more to embrace, And all Cyrene sadden'd at his woe. ON MILTIADES. Miltiades! thy valour best (Although in every region known) The men of Persia can attest, Taught by thyself at Marathon. ON AN INFANT. Bewail not much, my parents! me, the prey Of ruthless Hades, and sepulchred here. An infant, in my fifth scarce finish'd year, He found all sportive, innocent, and gay, Your young Callimachus; and if I knew Not many joys, my griefs were also few. BY HERACLIDES. In Cnidus born, the consort I became Of Euphron. Aretimias was my name. His bed I shared, nor proved a barren bride, But bore two children at a birth, and died. One child I leave to solace and uphold Euphron hereafter, when infirm and old. And one, for his remembrance sake, I bear To Pluto's realm, till he shall join me there. ON THE REED. I was of late a barren plant, Useless, insignificant, Nor fig, nor grape, nor apple bore, A native of the marshy shore; But gather'd for poetic use, And plunged into a sable juice, Of which my modicum I sip With narrow mouth and slender lip, At once, although by nature dumb, All eloquent I have become, And speak with fluency untired, As if by Phœbus' self inspired. TO HEALTH. Eldest born of powers divine! Bless'd Hygeia! be it mine To enjoy what thou canst give, And henceforth with thee to live: For in power if pleasure be, Wealth or numerous progeny, Or in amorous embrace, Where no spy infests the place; Or in aught that heaven bestows To alleviate human woes, When the wearied heart despairs Of a respite from its cares; These and every true delight Flourish only in thy sight; And the sister Graces three Owe, themselves, their youth to thee, Without whom we may possess Much, but never happiness. ON INVALIDS. Far happier are the dead, methinks, than they Who look for death, and fear it every day. ON THE ASTROLOGERS. The astrologers did all alike presage My uncle's dying in extreme old age; One only disagreed. But he was wise, And spoke not till he heard the funeral cries. ON AN OLD WOMAN. Mycilla dyes her locks, 'tis said; But 'tis a foul aspersion; She buys them black; they therefore need No subsequent immersion. No mischief worthier of our fear In nature can be found Than friendship, in ostent sincere, But hollow and unsound; For lull'd into a dangerous dream We close infold a foe, Who strikes, when most secure we seem, The inevitable blow. ON A TRUE FRIEND. Hast thou a friend? Thou hast indeed A rich and large supply, Treasure to serve your every need, Well managed, till you die. ON THE SWALLOW. Attic maid! with honey fed, Bear'st thou to thy callow brood Yonder locust from the mead, Destined their delicious food? Ye have kindred voices clear, Ye alike unfold the wing, Migrate hither, sojourn here, Both attendant on the spring! Ah, for pity drop the prize; Let it not with truth be said, That a songster gasps and dies, That a songster may be fed. ON LATE ACQUIRED WEALTH. Poor in my youth, and in life's later scenes Rich to no end, I curse my natal hour, Who nought enjoy'd while young, denied the means; And nought when old enjoy'd, denied the power. ON A BATH, BY PLATO. Did Cytherea to the skies From this pellucid lymph arise? Or was it Cytherea's touch, When bathing here, that made it such? ON A FOWLER, BY ISIODORUS. With seeds and birdlime, from the desert air, Eumelus gather'd free, though scanty, fare. No lordly patron's hand, he deign'd to kiss, Nor luxury knew, save liberty, nor bliss. Thrice thirty years he lived, and to his heirs His seeds bequeath'd, his birdlime, and his snares. ON NIOBE. Charon! receive a family on board Itself sufficient for thy crazy yawl; Apollo and Diana, for a word By me too proudly spoken, slew us all. ON A GOOD MAN. Traveller, regret not me; for thou shalt find Just cause of sorrow none in my decease, Who, dying, children's children left behind, And with one wife lived many a year in peace: Three virtuous youths espoused my daughters three, And oft their infants in my bosom lay, Nor saw I one, of all derived from me, Touch'd with disease, or torn by death away. Their duteous hands my funeral rites bestow'd, And me, by blameless manners fitted well To seek it, sent to the serene abode Where shades of pious men for ever dwell. ON A MISER. They call thee rich;—I deem thee poor, Since, if thou darest not use thy store, But savest it only for thine heirs, The treasure is not thine, but theirs. ANOTHER [ON A MISER]. A miser, traversing his house, Espied, unusual there, a mouse, And thus his uninvited guest Briskly inquisitive address'd: “Tell me, my dear, to what cause is it I owe this unexpected visit?” The mouse her host obliquely eyed, And, smiling, pleasantly replied: “Fear not, good fellow, for your hoard! I come to lodge, and not to board.” ANOTHER [ON A MISER]. [Art thou some individual of a kind] Art thou some individual of a kind Long-lived by nature as the rook or hind? Heap treasure, then, for if thy need be such, Thou hast excuse, and scarce canst heap too much. But man thou seem'st, clear therefore from thy breast This lust of treasure—folly at the best! For why shouldst thou go wasted to the tomb, To fatten with thy spoils thou know'st not whom? ON FEMALE INCONSTANCY. Rich, thou hadst many lovers;—poor, hast none, So surely want extinguishes the flame, And she who call'd thee once her pretty one, And her Adonis, now inquires thy name. Where wast thou born, Sosicrates, and where In what strange country can thy parents live, Who seem'st, by thy complaints, not yet aware That want's a crime no woman can forgive? ON THE GRASSHOPPER. Happy songster, perch'd above, On the summit of the grove, Whom a dewdrop cheers to sing With the freedom of a king! From thy perch survey the fields Where prolific nature yields Nought that, willingly as she, Man surrenders not to thee. For hostility or hate None thy pleasures can create. Thee it satisfies to sing Sweetly the return of spring, Herald of the genial hours, Harming neither herbs nor flowers. Therefore man thy voice attends Gladly,—thou and he are friends; Nor thy never-ceasing strains Phœbus or the Muse disdains As too simple or too long, For themselves inspire the song. Earth-born, bloodless, undecaying, Ever singing, sporting, playing, What has nature else to show Godlike in its kind as thou? ON HERMOCRATIA. Hermocratia named—save only one, Twice fifteen births I bore, and buried none; For neither Phœbus pierced my thriving joys, Nor Dian—she my girls, or he my boys. But Dian rather, when my daughters lay In parturition, chased their pangs away. And all my sons, by Phœbus' bounty, shared A vigorous youth, by sickness unimpair'd. O Niobe! far less prolific! see Thy boast against Latona shamed by me! FROM MENANDER. Fond youth! who dream'st that hoarded gold Is needful, not alone to pay For all thy various items sold, To serve the wants of every day; Bread, vinegar, and oil, and meat, For savoury viands season'd high; But somewhat more important yet— I tell thee what it cannot buy. No treasure, hadst thou more amass'd Than fame to Tantalus assign'd, Would save thee from a tomb at last, But thou must leave it all behind. I give thee, therefore, counsel wise; Confide not vainly in thy store, However large—much less despise Others comparatively poor; But in thy more exalted state A just and equal temper show, That all who see thee rich and great May deem thee worthy to be so. ON PALLAS BATHING, FROM A HYMN OF CALLIMACHUS. Nor oils of balmy scent produce, Nor mirror for Minerva's use, Ye nymphs who lave her; she, array'd In genuine beauty, scorns their aid. Not even when they left the skies To seek on Ida's head the prize From Paris' hand, did Juno deign, Or Pallas in the crystal plain Of Simois' stream her locks to trace, Or in the mirror's polish'd face, Though Venus oft with anxious care Adjusted twice a single hair. TO DEMOSTHENES. It flatters and deceives thy view, This mirror of ill polish'd ore; For were it just, and told thee true, Thou wouldst consult it never more. ON A SIMILAR CHARACTER. You give your cheeks a rosy stain, With washes dye your hair; But paint and washes both are vain To give a youthful air. Those wrinkles mock your daily toil, No labour will efface 'em, You wear a mask of smoothest oil, Yet still with ease we trace 'em. An art so fruitless then forsake, Which though you much excel in, You never can contrive to make Old Hecuba young Helen. ON AN UGLY FELLOW. Beware, my friend! of crystal brook, Or fountain, lest that hideous hook, Thy nose, thou chance to see; Narcissus' fate would then be thine, And self-detested thou wouldst pine, As self-enamour'd he. ON A BATTERED BEAUTY. Hair, wax, rouge, honey, teeth you buy, A multifarious store! A mask at once would all supply, Nor would it cost you more. ON A THIEF. When Aulus, the nocturnal thief, made prize Of Hermes, swift-wing'd envoy of the skies, Hermes, Arcadia's king, the thief divine, Who when an infant stole Apollo's kine, And whom, as arbiter and overseer Of our gymnastic sports, we planted here; “Hermes,” he cried, “you meet no new disaster; Ofttimes the pupil goes beyond his master.” ON PEDIGREE. FROM EPICHARMUS. My mother! if thou love me, name no more My noble birth! Sounding at every breath My noble birth, thou kill'st me. Thither fly, As to their only refuge, all from whom Nature withholds all good besides; they boast Their noble birth, conduct us to the tombs Of their forefathers, and from age to age Ascending, trumpet their illustrious race: But whom hast thou beheld, or canst thou name Derived from no forefathers? Such a man Lives not; for how could such be born at all? And if it chance that, native of a land Far distant, or in infancy deprived Of all his kindred, one, who cannot trace His origin, exist, why deem him sprung From baser ancestry than theirs who can? My mother! he whom nature at his birth Endow'd with virtuous qualities, although An Æthiop and a slave, is nobly born. ON ENVY. Pity, says the Theban bard, From my wishes I discard; Envy, let me rather be, Rather far, a theme for thee! Pity to distress is shown, Envy to the great alone. So the Theban: but to shine Less conspicuous be mine! I prefer the golden mean, Pomp and penury between; For alarm and peril wait Ever on the loftiest state, And the lowest to the end Obloquy and scorn attend. BY MOSCHUS. I slept when Venus enter'd: to my bed A Cupid in her beauteous hand she led, A bashful seeming boy, and thus she said: “Shepherd, receive my little one! I bring An untaught love, whom thou must teach to sing.” She said, and left him. I, suspecting nought, Many a sweet strain my subtle pupil taught, How reed to reed Pan first with osier bound, How Pallas form'd the pipe of softest sound, How Hermes gave the lute, and how the quire Of Phœbus owe to Phœbus' self the lyre. Such were my themes; my themes nought heeded he, But ditties sang of amorous sort to me, The pangs that mortals and immortals prove From Venus' influence, and the darts of love. Thus was the teacher by the pupil taught; His lessons I retain'd, and mine forgot. BY PHILEMON. Oft we enhance our ills by discontent, And give them bulk beyond what nature meant. A parent, brother, friend deceased, to cry— “He's dead indeed, but he was born to die”— Such temperate grief is suited to the size And burthen of the loss; is just and wise. But to exclaim, “Ah! wherefore was I born, Thus to be left for ever thus forlorn?” Who thus laments his loss invites distress, And magnifies a woe that might be less, Through dull despondence to his lot resign'd, And leaving reason's remedy behind. TRANSLATION OF AN EPIGRAM OF HOMER. Pay me my price, potters! and I will sing. Attend, O Pallas! and with lifted arm Protect their oven; let the cups and all The sacred vessels blacken well, and, baked With good success, yield them both fair renown And profit, whether in the market sold Or streets, and let no strife ensue between us. But, oh ye potters! if with shameless front Ye falsify your promise, then I leave No mischief uninvoked to avenge the wrong. Come, Syntrips, Smaragus, Sabactes, come, And Asbetus, nor let your direst dread, Omodamus, delay! Fire seize your house! May neither house nor vestibule escape! May ye lament to see confusion mar And mingle the whole labour of your hands, And may a sound fill all your oven, such As of a horse grinding his provender, While all your pots and flagons bounce within. Come hither also, daughter of the sun, Circe the sorceress, and with thy drugs Poison themselves, and all that they have made! Come also, Chiron, with thy numerous troop Of centaurs, as well those who died beneath The club of Hercules, as who escaped, And stamp their crockery to dust; down fall Their chimney; let them see it with their eyes, And howl to see the ruin of their art, While I rejoice; and if a potter stoop To peep into his furnace, may the fire Flash in his face and scorch it, that all men Observe, thenceforth, equity and good faith. Oct. 1790. ADAM: A SACRED DRAMA. TRANSLATED FROM THE ITALIAN OF GIO. BATTISTA ANDREINI. THE CHARACTERS. Chorus of Seraphim, Cherubim, and Angels. The Archangel Michael. Adam. Eve. A Cherub, the Guardian of Adam. Lucifer Satan. Beelzebub. Seven Mortal Sins. The World. The Flesh. Famine. Labour. Despair. Death. Vain Glory. The Serpent. Volano, an Infernal Messenger. A Chorus of Phantoms. A Chorus of Fiery, Airy, Aquatic, and Infernal Spirits. CHORUS OF ANGELS SINGING THE GLORY OF GOD. To Heaven's bright lyre let Iris be the bow, Adapt the spheres for chords, for notes the stars; Let new-born gales discriminate the bars, Nor let old Time to measure times be slow. Hence to new Music of the eternal Lyre Add richer harmony and praise to praise; For him who now his wondrous might displays, And shows the Universe its aweful Sire. O Thou who ere the World or Heaven was made, Didst in thyself, that World, that Heaven enjoy, How does thy bounty all its powers employ; What inexpressive good hast thou display'd! O Thou of sovereign love almighty source, Who know'st to make thy works thy love express, Let pure devotion's fire the soul possess, And give the heart and hand a kindred force. Then shalt thou hear how, when the world began, Thy life-producing voice gave myriads birth, Call'd forth from nothing all in Heaven and Earth, Bless'd in thy light as Eagles in the Sun. ACT THE FIRST. SCENE THE FIRST. God the Father—Chorus of Angels. Raise from this dark abyss thy horrid visage, O Lucifer! aggrieved by light so potent, Shrink from the blaze of these refulgent planets, And pant beneath the rays of no fierce sun; Read in the sacred volumes of the sky, The mighty wonders of a hand divine. Behold, thou frantic rebel, How easy is the task, To the great Sire of Worlds, To raise his empyrean seat sublime: Lifting humility Thither whence pride hath fallen. From thence with bitter grief, Inhabitant of fire, and mole of darkness, Let the perverse behold, Despairing his escape and my compassion, His own perdition in another's good, And Heaven now closed to him, to others open'd; And sighing from the bottom of his heart, Let him in homage to my power exclaim, Ah, this creative Sire, (Wretch as I am) I see, Hath need of nothing but himself alone To re-establish all. THE SERAPHIM SING. O scene worth heavenly musing, With sun and moon their glorious light diffusing; Where to angelic voices, Sphere circling sphere rejoices, How dost thou rise, exciting Man to fond contemplation Of his benign creation! THE CHERUBIM SING. The volume of the stars, The sovereign Author plann'd, Inscribing it with his eternal hand, And his benignant aim Their beams in lucid characters proclaim; And man in these delighting, Feels their bright beams inviting, And seems though prison'd in these mortal bars, Walking on earth to mingle with the stars. GOD THE FATHER. Angels, desert your Heaven! with you to Earth, That Power descends, whom Heaven accompanies; Let each spectator of these works sublime Behold, with meek devotion, Earth into flesh transform'd, and clay to man, Man to a sovereign lord, And souls to Seraphim. THE SERAPHIM SING. Now let us cleave the sky with wings of gold, The world be paradise, Since to its fruitful breast Now the great Sovereign of our quire descends; Now let us cleave the sky with wings of gold; Strew yourselves flowers beneath the step divine, Ye rivals of the stars! Summon'd from every sphere Ye gems of heaven, heaven's radiant wealth appear; Now let us cleave the sky with wings of gold! GOD THE FATHER. Behold, ye springing herbs and new-born flowers, The step that used to press the stars alone And the sun's spacious road, This day begins, along the sylvan scene, To leave its grand impression: To low materials now I stretch my hand, To form a work sublime. THE ANGELS SING. Lament, lament in anguish, Angel to God rebellious! See, on a sudden rise The creature doom'd to fill thy radiant seat! Foolish thy pride took fire Contemplating thy birth; But he o'er pride shall triumph, Acknowledging he sprung from humble dust. From hence he shall acquire As much as thou hast lost; Since the Supreme Inhabitant of Heaven Receives the humble, and dethrones the proud. GOD THE FATHER. Adam, arise, since I to thee impart A spirit warm from my benignant breath; Arise, arise, first man, And joyous let the world Embrace its living miniature in thee! Adam. O marvels new, O hallow'd, O divine, Eternal object of the angel host: Why do I not possess tongues numerous As now the stars in heaven? Now then, before A thing of earth so mean, See I the great Artificer divine? Mighty Ruler supernal, If 'tis denied this tongue To match my obligation with my thanks, Behold my heart's affection, And hear it speaking clearer than my tongue, And to thee bending lower Than this my humble knee. Now, now, O Lord, in ecstasy devout, Let my mind mount, and passing all the clouds, Passing each sphere, even up to heaven ascend, And there behold the stars, a seat for man! Thou Lord, who all the fire of genuine love Convertest to thyself, Transform me into thee, that I a part Even of thyself, may thus acquire the power To offer praises not unworthy thee. THE ANGELS SING. To smile in paradise, Great demigod of earth, direct thy step; There like the tuneful spheres, Circle the murmuring rills Of limpid water bright; There the melodious birds Rival angelic quires; There lovely flowers profuse Appear as vivid stars; The snowy rose is there A silver moon, the heliotrope a sun: What more can be desired, By earth's new lord in fair corporeal vest, Than in the midst of earth to find a heaven? Adam. O ye harmonious birds! Bright scene of lovely flowers. But what delightful slumber Falls on my closing eyes? I lay me down, adieu Unclouded light of day, sweet air adieu! GOD THE FATHER. Adam, behold I come, Son dear to me, thou son Of an indulgent sire; Behold the hand that never works in vain: Behold the hand that join'd the elements, That added heaven to heavens, That fill'd the stars with light, Gave lustre to the moon, Prescribed the sun his course, And now supports the world, And forms a solid stage for thy firm step. Now sleeping, Adam from thy open'd side The substance I will take That shall have woman's name, and lovely form. THE ANGELS SING. Immortal works of an immortal Maker! Ye high and blessed seats Of this delightful world, Ye starry seats of heaven, Trophies divine, productions pre-ordain'd: O power! O energy! Which out of shadowy horror form'd the Sun! Eve. What heavenly melody pervades my heart, Ere yet the sound my ear! inviting me To gaze on wonders, what do I behold, What transformations new; Is earth become the heaven? Do I behold his light Whose splendour dazzles the meridian sun? Am I the creature of that plastic hand, Who form'd of nought the angels and the heavens? Thou sovereign Lord! whom lowly I adore, A love so tender penetrates my heart, That while my tongue ventures on utterance, The words with difficulty Find passage from my lips; For in a tide of tears, (That sighs have caused to flow) they seem absorb'd. Thou pure celestial love Of the benignant power, Who pleased to manifest on earth his glory, Now to this world descends, To draw from abject clay The governor of all created things: Lord of the hallow'd and concealed affection, Thou in whom love glows with such fervent flame, Inspirit even my tongue With suitable reply, that these dear vales And sylvan scenes may hear Thanks, that to thee I should devote, my Sire, But if my tongue be mute, speak thou, my heart. GOD THE FATHER. Adam, awake! and cease To meditate in rapturous trance profound Things holy and abstruse, And the deep secrets of the Trinal Lord. Adam. Where am I? where have I been? what Sun Of triple influence that dims the day Now from my eye withdraws, where is he vanish'd? O hallow'd miracles Of this imperial seat, Of these resplendent suns, Which though divided, form A single ray of light immeasurable, Embellishing all Heaven, And giving grace and lustre To every winged Seraph; Divine mysterious light, Flowing from sovereign Good, To him alone thou art known, Who mounts to thee an eagle in his faith. What rose of snowy hue and sacred form, In these celestial bowers, Wet with Empyreal dews, have I beheld Opening its bosom to the suns! or rather One of these suns making the rose its Heaven; And in a moment's space, (O marvels most sublime,) With deluges of light, And in a lily's form, Rise from that lovely virgin bosom blest. Can suns be lilies then, And lilies children of the maiden rose? GOD THE FATHER. The Heaven's too lofty, and too low the world; Suffice it that in vain Man's humble intellect Attempts to sound the depth of deeds divine: Press in the fond embraces of thy heart The consort of thy bosom, And let her name be Eve. Adam. O my beloved companion, Support of my existence, My glory and my power, Flesh of my flesh, and of my bone the bone, Behold I clasp thy bosom In plenitude of pure and hallow'd love. GOD THE FATHER. I leave you now, my children; rest in peace, Receive my blessing, and so fruitful prove That for your offspring earth may scarce suffice! Man, be thou lord of all that now the sun Warms or the ocean laves; impose a name On every thing that flies, or runs, or swims. Now through the ear descending to your soul Receive the immutable decree; hear, Adam, Let thy companion hear, and in your hearts Made the abode of love, Cherish the mighty word! Of fruits whatever from a spreading branch Each copious tree may offer to your hands, Of dainty viands whatsoe'er abound In this delightful garden, This paradise of flowers, The gay delight of man, The treasure of the earth, The wonder of the world, the work of God, These, O my son, these thou art free to taste: But of the Tree comprising Good and Evil Under the pain of dying To him who knows not death, Be now the fruit forbidden! I leave ye now, and through my airy road, Departing from the world, return to Heaven. THE SERAPHIM SING. Let every airy cloud on earth descend, And luminous and light Repose with God upon this glowing sphere! Then let the stars descend, Descend the moon and sun, Forming bright steps to the empyreal world, And each rejoice that the supreme Creator Has deign'd to visit what his hand produced. Adam. O scene of splendour, viewing which I see The glories of my God in lovelier light, How through my eyes do you console my heart! See, at a single nod of our great Sire, (Dear partner of my life,) Fire bursting forth with elemental power! The Sea, Heaven, Earth, their properties assume, And air grows air, although there were before Nor fire, nor heaven, nor air, nor earth, nor sea. Behold the azure sky, in which ofttimes The lovely glittering star Shall wake the dawn, attired in heavenly light, The herald of the morn, To spread the boundless lustre of the day; Then shall the radiant sun, To gladden all the world, Diffuse abroad his energy of light; And when his eye is weary of the earth, The pure and silvery moon And the minuter stars Shall form the pomp of night. Behold where fire o'er every element, Lucid and light, assumes its lofty seat! Behold the simple field of spotless air Made the support of variegated birds, That with their tuneful notes Guide the delightful hours! See the great bosom of the fertile earth With flowers embellish'd and with fruits mature! See on her verdant brow she seems to bear Hills as her crown, and as her sceptre trees! Behold the ocean's fair cerulean plain, That 'midst its humid sands and vales profound, And 'midst its silent and its scaly tribes, Rolls over buried gold and precious pearl, And crimson coral raising to the sky Its wavy head with herbs and amber crown'd! Stupendous all proclaim Their Maker's power and glory. Eve. All manifest thy might O Architect divine! Adam. Dear partner, let us go Where to invite our step God's other wonders shine, a countless tribe. SCENE THE SECOND. Lucifer. Who from my dark abyss Calls me to gaze on this excess of light? What miracles unseen Show'st thou to me, O God? Art thou then tired of residence in heaven? Why hast thou form'd on earth This lovely paradise? And wherefore place in it Two earthly demi-gods of human mould? Say thou vile architect, Forming thy work of dust, What will befall this naked helpless man, The sole inhabitant of glens and woods? Does he then dream of treading on the stars? Heaven is impoverish'd and I, alone The cause, enjoy the ruin I produced. Let him unite above Star upon star, moon, sun, And let his Godhead toil To re-adorn and re-illume his Heaven! Since in the end derision Shall prove his works, and all his efforts vain: For Lucifer alone was that full light Which scatter'd radiance o'er the plains of heaven. But these his present fires, are shade and smoke, Base counterfeits of my more potent beams. I reck not what he means to make his heaven, Nor care I what his creature man may be. Too obstinate and firm Is my undaunted thought, In proving that I am implacable 'Gainst Heaven, 'gainst Man, the Angels, and their God. SCENE THE THIRD. Satan, Beelzebub, and Lucifer. Satan. To light, to light to raise the embattled brows, A symbol of the firm and generous heart That ardent dwells in the unconquer'd breast. Must we then suffer such excessive wrong? And shall we not with hands, thus talon-arm'd, Tear out the stars from their celestial seat; And as our sign of conquest, Down in our dark abyss Shall we not force the sun, and moon to blaze, Since we are those, who in dread feats of arms Warring amongst the stars, Made the bright face of Heaven turn pale with fear? To arms! to arms! redoubted Beelzebub! Ere yet 'tis heard around, To our great wrong and memorable shame, That by the race of man (mean child of clay) The stars expect a new sublimity. Beelzebub. I burn with such fierce flame, Such stormy venom deluges my soul, That with intestine rage My groans like thunder sound, my looks are lightning, And my extorted tears are fiery showers! 'Tis needful therefore from my brow to shake The hissing serpents that o'ershade my visage, To gaze upon these mighty works of Heaven, And the new demi-gods. Silent be he, who thinks (Now that this man is form'd,) To imitate his voice and thus exclaim, Distressful Satan, ye unhappy spirits, How wretched is your lot, from being first, Fallen and degenerate, lost as ye are; Heaven was your station once, your seat the stars, And your great Maker God! Now abject wretches, having lost for ever, Eternal morn and each celestial light, Heaven calls you now the denizens of woe. Instead of moving in the solar road, You press the plains of everlasting night; And for your golden tresses And looks angelical, Your locks are snaky, and your glance malign, Your burning lips a murky vapour breathe, And every tongue now teems with blasphemy, And all blaspheming raise A cloud sulphureous of foam and fire; Arm'd with the eagle's talon, feet of goat, And dragon's wing, your residence in fire, Profoundest Tartarus unblest and dark, The theatre of anguish, That shuts itself against the beams of day! Since the dread angel, born to brook no law, To desolate the sky And raise the powers of Hell, Ought to breathe sanguine fire, and on his brow Display the ensign of sublimest horror. Satan. Though arm'd with talons keen, and eagle beak, Snaky our tresses, and our aspect fierce, Cloven our feet, our frames with horror plumed, And though our deep abode Be fix'd in shadowy scenes of darkest night, Let us be Angels still in dignity; As far surpassing others as the Lord Of highest power, his low and humble slaves. If far from heaven our pennons we expand, Let us remember still That we alone are lords, and they are slaves; And that resigning meaner seats in heaven, We in their stead have raised a royal throne Immense and massy, where the mighty chief Of all our legions higher lifts his brow, Than the proud mountain that upholds your heaven; And there with heaven still waging endless war, Threatening the stars, our adversaries ever, Bears a dread sceptre kindling into flame, That while he wheels it round, darts forth a blaze More dazzling than the sun's meridian ray. Lucifer. 'Tis time to show my power, my brave compeers, Magnanimous and mighty Angels endow'd with martial potency, I know the grief that gives you living death, Is to see man exalted To stations so sublime, That all created things to him submit; Since ye already doubt, That to those lofty seats of flaming glory, (Our treasure once and pride, but now renounced,) This pair shall one day rise With all the numerous train Of their posterity. Satan. Great Lord of the infernal deep abyss, To thee I bow, and speak The anguish of my soul, That for this man, grows hourly more severe, Fearing the Incarnation of the Word. Lucifer. Can it be true, that from so little dust A deity shall rise! That flesh, that deity, that lofty power, That chains us to the deep? To this vile clod of earth, He who himself yet claims to be adored? Shall angels then do homage thus to men? And can then flesh impure Give to angelic nature higher powers? Can it be true, and to devise the mode Escape our intellect, ours who so dear Have bought the boast of wisdom? I yet am He, I am, Who would not suffer that above in heaven, Your lofty nature should submit to outrage, When that insensate wish Possess'd the tyrant of the starry throne, That you should prostrate fall, Before the Incarnate Word: I am that Spirit, I, who for your sake Collecting dauntless courage, to the north Led you far distant from the senseless will, Of him who boasts to have created heaven. And ye are those, your ardour speaks you well, And your bold hearts that o'er the host of heaven Gave me assurance of proud victory. Arise! let glory's flame Blaze in your breast, nor be it ever heard, That him whom ye disdain To worship in the sky, Ye stoop to worship in the depth of hell! Such were your oaths to me, By your inestimable worth in arms, Your worth, alas, so great That heaven itself deserved not to enjoy it. Oh, 'twere an outrage and a shame too great, Were we not ready to revenge it all; I see already flaming in your looks, The matchless valour of your ardent hearts; Already see your pinions spread in air, To overwhelm the world and highest heaven, That, all creation sunk in the abyss, This mortal may be found Instantly crush'd, and buried in his birth. Satan. At length pronounce thy orders! Say what thou wilt, and with a hundred tongues Speak, speak! that instant in a hundred works Satan may toil, and Hell strain all her powers. Lucifer. Behold, to smooth the rough and arduous way By which they deem'd they may ascend to glory, Behold a God assumes A human form in vain! A mode too prompt and easy, To crush the race of mortals, The ancient God affords to new-born man. Nature herself too much inclines, or rather Forces this creature, to support his life Frequent to feed on various viands; hence Since on delicious dainties His bitter fall depends, He may be tempted now to fruit forbidden, And by the paths of death, As he was nothing once, return to nothing. Beelzebub. Great Angel! greatly thought! Lucifer. Rather the noble spirit Of higher towering thought prompts me to speak, That God perchance indignant that his hands Have stoop'd to stain themselves in abject clay, Seeing how different angel is from man, Repenting of his work, Forbad him to support his frail existence Upon this sweet allurement; hence to sin Prompted by natural motives, though tyrannic, He should himself the earth's destroyer prove, Converting his vile clay to dust again; And plucking up again The rooted world, thus to the highest heaven Open a faithful passage, Repenting of his wrong to us of old Its ornaments sublime! Satan. Pardon, O pardon, if my humble thought Aspiring by my tongue Too high, perhaps offend your sovereign ear! Long as this man shall rest Alive, and breathe on earth, Exhausted we must bear Fierce war, in endless terror of the Word. Lucifer. Man yet shall rest alive, he yet shall breathe, And sinning even to death, This new-made race of mortals Shall cover all the earth, And reign o'er all its creatures; His soul shall prove eternal, The image of his God. Yet shall the Incarnate Word, I trust, be foil'd. Beelzebub. Oh! precious tidings to angelic ears, That heal the wounds of all our shatter'd host. Lucifer. Let man exist to sin, since he by sinning Shall make the weight of sin his heritage, Which shall be in his race Proclaim'd original; So that mankind existing but to sin, And sinning still to death, And still to error born, In evil hour the Word Will wear the sinner's form, if rightly deem'd The enemy of sin. Now rise, ye Spirits, from the dark abyss, You who would rest assured That man the sinner is now doom'd to death. SCENE THE FOURTH. Melecano, Lurcone, Lucifer, Satan, and Beelzebub. Melecano. Command us, mighty Lord; what are thy wishes? Would'st thou extinguish the new-risen sun? Behold what stores I bring Of darkness and of fire! Alas! with fury Melecano burns. Lurcone. Behold Lurcone, thou supreme of Hell, Who 'gainst the highest heaven Pants to direct his rage, whence light of limb, Though loaded deep with wrath, He stands with threatening aspect in thy presence. Lucifer. Thou, Melecan, assume the name of Pride; Lurcone, thou of Envy; both united, (Since power combined with power Acquires new force) to man direct your way; Nor him alone essay, it is my will That woman also mourn; Contrive that she may murmur at her God, Because in birth not prior to the man; Since every future man is now ordain'd To draw his life from woman, with such thoughts Let her wax envious, that she cannot soar Above the man, as high as now below him. Hence, Lurcon, be it thine to make her proud; Let her give law to her Creator God, Wishing o'er man priority of birth. Melecano. Behold, where Melecan, a dog in fierceness, The savage dog of hell, Darts growling to his prey! He flies, and he returns All cover'd and all drench'd with human gore. Lurcone. I rapid too depart, And, on a swifter wing Than through the cloudless air Darts the keen eagle to his earthly prey. Behold, I too return, My beak with carnage fill'd, and talons full. Lucifer. Haste, Arfarat and Ruspican, rise all, Rise from the centre to survey the earth! SCENE THE FIFTH. Ruspican, Arfarat, Lucifer, Satan, and Beelzebub. Ruspican. Soon as I heard the name of Ruspican, With rapid pinions spread, I sought the skies, To bend before the great Tartarian chief, And aggravate the woes Of this new mortal blest with air and light. Arfarat. Scarce had thy mighty voice Re-echoed through the deep, When the Tartarean fires Flying I left for this serener sky, Forth from my lips, and heart, Breathing fierce rancour 'gainst the life of man. Lucifer. Fly, Ruspican, with all your force and fury! Since now I call thee by the name of Anger, Find Eve, and tell her that the fair endowment Of her free will, deserves not she should live In vassalage to man; That she alone in value far exceeds All that the sun in his bright circle warms; That she from flesh, man from the meaner dust Arose to life, in the fair garden she Created pure, he in the baser field. Ruspican. I joy to change the name of Ruspican For Anger, dark and deadly: Hence now by my tremendous aid, destructive And deadly be this day! Behold I go with all my force and fury; Behold I now transfuse My anger all into the breast of woman! Lucifer. Of Avarice I give, O Arfarat, to thee the name and works; Go, see, contend, and conquer! Contrive that wandering Eve, With down-cast eyes, may in the fruitful garden Search with solicitude for hidden treasure: Then stimulate her heart, To wish no other Lord, Except herself, of Eden and the world. Arfarat. See me already plumed With wings of gems and gold; See with an eye of sapphire I gaze upon the fair; Behold to her I speak, With lips that emulate the ruby's lustre. Receive now as thy own (Thus I accost her) all the world's vast wealth! If she reject my gift, Then will I tempt her with a shower of pearls, A fashion yet unknown; Thus will she melt, and thus I hope at last In chains of gold to drag her to destruction. Lucifer. Rise, Guliar, Dulciato, and Maltia! To make the band of enemies complete, That, like a deadly hydra, Shall dart against this man Your seven crests portentous and terrific. SCENE THE SIXTH. Maltia, Dulciato, Guliar, Lucifer, Satan, Beelzebub. Behold! we come with emulation fierce To your severe command, In prompt obedience let us rise to heaven; Let us with wrath assail This human enemy of abject clay. Lucifer. Maltia, thou shalt take the name of Sloth: Sudden invest thyself with drowsy charms And mischievous repose; Now wait on Eve, in slothfulness absorb'd, Let all this pomp of flowers, And all these tuneful birds Be held by her in scorn; And from her consort flying, Now let her feel no wishes but for death. Maltia. What shall I say? shall I, to others mute, Announce to thee my sanguinary works? Savage and silent, I Would be loquacious in my deeds alone. Lucifer. Thee, Dulciato, we name Luxury; Haste thou to Eve, and fill her with desires To decorate her fragile form with flowers, To bind her tresses with a golden fillet, With various vain devices to allure A new found paramour; And to her heart suggest, That to exchange her love may prove delightful. Dulciato. Can Lord so mighty, from his humble slave, Demand no higher task? The way to purchase honour Now will I teach all Hell, By the completion of my glorious triumph. Already Eve beside a chrystal fount Exults to vanquish the vermilion rose With cheeks of sweeter bloom, And to exceed the lily By her yet whiter bosom; Now beauteous threads of gold She thinks her tresses floating in the air; Now amorous and charming, Her radiant eyes she reckons suns of love, Fit to inflame the very coldest heart. Lucifer. Guliar, be thou call'd Gluttony; now go, Reveal to Eve that the forbidden fruit Is manna all within, And that such food in heaven Forms the repast of angels and of God. Guliar. Of all the powerful foes Leagued against man, Guliar is only he Who can induce him to oppose his Maker: Hence rapidly I fly To work the woe of mortals. Satan. To arms, to arms! to ruin and to blood! Yes, now to blood, infernal leeches all! Again, again proclaiming war to Heaven, And let us put to flight Every audacious foe That ventures to disturb our ancient peace. Beelzebub. Now, now, great chief, with feet That testify thy triumph, I see thee crush the sun, The moon, and all the stars; For where thy radiance shines, O Lucifer! all other beams are blind. Lucifer. Away. Heaven shudders at the mighty ruin That threatens it from our infernal host; Already I behold the moon opaque, And light-supplying sun, The wandering stars, and fixt, With terror pale, and sinking in eclipse. ACT THE SECOND. SCENE THE FIRST. Chorus of Angels singing. Now let us garlands weave Of all the fairest flowers, Now at this early dawn, For new made man, and his companion dear; Let all with festive joy, And with melodious song, Of the great Architect Applaud this noblest work, And speak the joyous sound, Man is the wonder both of Earth and Heaven. FIRST ANGEL. Your warbling now suspend, You pure angelic progeny of God, Behold the labour emulous of Heaven! Behold the woody scene, Deck'd with a thousand flowers of grace divine; Here man resides, here ought he to enjoy In his fair mate eternity of bliss. SECOND ANGEL. How exquisitely sweet This rich display of flowers, This airy wild of fragrance, So lovely to the eye, And to the sense so sweet. THIRD ANGEL. O the sublime Creator, How marvellous his works, and more his power! Such is the sacred flame Of his celestial love, Not able to confine it in himself, He breathed, as fruitful sparks From his creative breast, The Angels, Heaven, Man, Woman, and the World. FOURTH ANGEL. Yes, mighty Lord! yes, hallow'd love divine! Who, ever in thyself completely blest, Unconscious of a want, Who from thyself alone, and at thy will, Bright with benignant flames, Without the aid of matter or of form, By efficacious power Hast of mere nothing form'd The whole angelic host; With potency endow'd, And that momentous gift, Either by sin to fall, Or by volition stand. FIFTH ANGEL. Hence, our Almighty Maker, To render us more worthy of his Heaven, And to confirm us in eternal grace, Presented to our homage The pure Incarnate Word; That as a recompence for hallow'd toil So worthily achieved, We might adore him humble; For there's a written law In the records of Heaven, That not a work of God that breathes and lives, And is endow'd with reason, Shall hold a seat in Heaven, If it incline not first with holy zeal, In tender adoration to the Word. SIXTH ANGEL. Justly each Spirit in the realms above, And all of mortal race, And every foe to Heaven, Should bow the knee in reverence of the Word; Since this is he whom from eternity God in the aweful depth Of his sublime and fruitful mind produced; He is not accident, but substance true, As rare as perfect, and as truly great As his high Author holy and divine. SEVENTH ANGEL. This living Word, image express of God, Is a resemblance of his mighty substance; Whence he is called the Son, the Son of God, Even as the Father, God; The generated Word By generation yields not unto time, Since from eternity the eternal Father Produced this Son, whence he rejoices there, Great offspring of great Father there for ever! For ever he is born, There he is fed, and fostered With plenitude of grace Imparted by his Sire: There was the Father ever, and the Son Was ever at his side, or in the Father; Nor younger is the Son Than his Almighty Sire, Nor elder is the Father Than his eternal Son. EIGHTH ANGEL. O Son, O Sire, O God, O Man, O Word, Let all with bended knee, With humble adoration reverence you! NINTH ANGEL. O Lucifer, now doom'd to endless pain, Had'st thou been join'd with us In worship of the Word, How had'st thou now been blessed in thy God! But thou in pride alone, yes, thou alone In thy great wisdom foolish, Hast scorn'd the Paragon, And wouldst not reverence the Incarnate God; Whence by thy folly thou hast fallen as far As thy proud soul expected to ascend. TENTH ANGEL. Monster of fierceness, dwell In thy obscure recess! And for thy weighty crime Incessant feel and infinite thy pain, For infinite has been thy vast offence. ELEVENTH ANGEL. Reside for ever in the deep abyss, For well the world's eternal Master knows Again to fill those high celestial seats, That by your ruin you have vacant left; Behold man fashion'd from the earth, who lives, Like plants that vegetate; See in a moment's space How the pure breath of life, Breathed on his visage by the power divine, Endows the wonderous creature with a soul, A pure immortal soul, That graced, and lovely with exalted powers, Shines the great faithful image of its God. Behold it has the gift to merit highly, The option to deserve or heaven or hell, In free will perfect, as the first of angels. TWELFTH ANGEL. Yes, man alone was form'd in just derision Of all the infernal host, As lord of this fair world and all that lives, The ornament of all, The miracle of nature, The perfect heir of heaven, Related to the angels, Adopted son of God, And semblance of the Holy Trinity; What couldst thou hope for more, what more attain, Creature miraculous, In whom the eternal Lord Has now vouchsafed to signalise his power? THIRTEENTH ANGEL. How singular and worthy is his form, Upright in stature, meek in dignity; Well fashion'd are his limbs, and his complexion Well temper'd, with a high majestic brow, A brow turn'd upward to his native sky; In language eloquent, in thought sublime, For contemplation of his Maker form'd. FOURTEENTH ANGEL. Placed in a state of innocence is man; Primeval justice is his blessed gift, Hence are his senses to his reason subject, His body to his mind, Enjoying reason as his prime endowment. FIFTEENTH ANGEL. Supernal love held him too highly dear, To let him dwell alone; And thence of lovely woman (Fair faithful aid) bestow'd on man the gift. Adam, 'tis thine alone To keep thy duty to thy Lord unstain'd; In his command of the forbidden fruit, Thy gift of freedom keep inviolate; And though he fashion'd thee without thy aid, Think not without thy aid he means to save thee! But since, descending from the heights of heaven, We come as kind attendants upon man, Now let us haste to Eden's flowery banks. ALL THE ANGELS SING. Now take we happy flight To Paradise, adorn'd with fairest flowers; There let us almost worship The mighty lord of this transcendent world, And joyous let us sing This flowery heaven, and Adam as its God. SCENE THE SECOND. Adam. O mighty Lord of mighty things sublime! O my supreme Creator! O bounteous in thy love To me thy humble servant, such rare blessings With liberal hand thou givest, Where'er I turn my eyes, I see myself revered. Approach ye animals that range the field! And ye now close your variegated wings, Ye pleasing birds! in me you look on Adam, On him ordain'd to name All things that gracious God has made for man; And praise, with justice praise Him who created me, who made you all, And in his bounteous love with me rejoice. But what do I behold? blest that I am, My dear, my sweet companion! Who comes to hail me with a gift of flowers, And with these sylvan honours crown my brow. Go! stately lion, go! and thou with scales Impenetrable arm'd Rhinoceros, whose pride can strike to earth The unconquer'd elephant! Thou fiery courser bound along the fields, And with thy neighing shake the echoing vale; Thou camel, and all here, or beast, or bird, Retire, in homage to approaching Eve! Eve. O what delight more dear, Than that, which, Adam in my sight enjoys, Draws him far off from me? Ye tender flowers, Where may I find on you The traces of his step? Lurcone. See man and woman! hide thyself and watch! Adam. No more fatigue my eyes, Nor with thy animated glances dart Such radiant lightning round; Turn the clear Heaven of thy serener face, To him who loves its light; See thy beloved Adam, Behold him, my sweet love: O thou, who art alone Joy of the world, and dear delight of man! Lurcone. Dread the approach of evil! Guliar. Dread the deceit of hell! Eve. By sovereign content I feel my tongue enchain'd; But though my voice be mute, My countenance may seem more eloquent, Expressing, though in silence, all my joy. Adam. O my companion dear! Lurcone. And soon perchance thy foe! Adam. O thou my sweetest life! Guliar. Perchance thy bitter death! Eve. Take, gentle Adam, from my hand these flowers; With these, my gift, let me entwine thy locks. Adam. Ye lilies, and ye shrubs of snowy hue, Jasmine as ivory pure, Ye spotless graces of the shining field; And thou most lovely rose Of tint most delicate, Fair consort of the morn, Delighted to imbibe The genial dew of Heaven, Rich vegetations vermil-tinctured gem, April's enchanting herald, Thou flower supremely blest, And queen of all the flowers, Thou form'st around my locks A garland of such fragrance, That up to Heaven itself Thy balmy sweets ascend. Let us in pure embraces So twine ourselves, my love, That we may seem united, One well-compact, and intricate acanthus. Lurcone. Soon shall the fetters of infernal toil So spread around ye both, The indissoluble bond, No mortal effort shall have power to break! Eve. Now, that with flowers so lovely We have adorn'd our tresses, Here let us both with humble reverence kneel, And praise our mighty Maker. From this my thirsting heart No longer can refrain. Adam. At thy engaging words, And thy pure heart's desire, On these pure herbs and flowers, I bend my willing knee in hallow'd bliss. Lurcone. Away! far off must I From act so meekly just Furious depart, and leave the light of day. Guliar. I must partake thy flight, And follow thee, alas, surcharged with grief. Adam. Now that these herbs and flowers to our bent knees, Such easy rest afford, Let us with zealous ardour raise our eyes, Contemplating with praise our mighty Maker! First then, devout and favour'd Eve, do thou With sacred notes invite To deeds so fair thy Adam. Eve. My Lord Omnipotent, In his celestial essence Is first, supreme, unlimited, alone, Eternal, uncompounded, He no beginning had, no end will have. Adam. My sovereign Lord, so great, Is irresistible, terrific, just, Gracious, benign, indulgent, Divine, unspotted, holy, loving, good, In justice most revered, Ancient of days, in his sublimest court. Eve. He rests in highest Heaven, Yet more exalted in his boundless self; Thence his all-searching eye looks down on all; Nought is from him conceal'd Since all exists in him: Without him nothing could retain existence, Nor is there aught that he For his perfection needs, Except himself alone. Adam. He every place pervades, But is confined in none: In him the limits of all grandeur lie, But he exists unlimited by space. Eve. Above the universe himself he raised, Yet he behind it rests; The whole he now encircles, now pervades, Now dwells apart from all, So great, the universe To comprehend him fails. Adam. If he to all inclines, In his just balance all he justly weighs; From him if all things flow, All things in him acknowledge their support, But he on nothing rests. Eve. To time my great director is not subject, For time in him sees no vicissitude: In aweful and sublime eternity One being stands for ever; For ever stands one instant, And hence this power assumes the name of God. Adam. It is indeed a truth, That my eternal mighty Lord is God; This deity incomprehensible That, ere the Heaven was made, Dwelt only in himself, and heaven in him. Eve, let us joyous rise; in other scenes, With admiration of celestial splendour And of this lovely world, With notes of hallow'd bliss Let us again make the glad air resound. Eve. Lead on, my faithful guide; Quick is my willing foot to follow thee, Since my fond soul believes That I in praising heaven to heaven ascend, So my pure bosom feels Full of divine content. Adam. To speak on every theme Our mighty Maker made thee eloquent, So that in praising heaven thou seemest there. My fair associate! treasure of my life! Upon the wings of this exalted praise Devotion soars so high, that if her feet Rest on the earth, her spirit reaches heaven. SCENE THE THIRD. The Serpent, Satan, Spirits. Serpent. To arms, to battle, O ye sons of power! Ye warring spirits of the infernal field! A new and wondrous war Awaits you now, within the lists of earth; Most strange indeed the mode Of warring there, if triumph, war's great end, Proves its beginning now. Behold the sun himself turn pale with terror, Behold the day obscured! Behold each rapid bird directs his flight Where thickest foliage spreads, But shelter seeks in vain; The leaves of every bough, As with a palsy struck, Affright him more, and urge his wings to flight. I would not as a warrior take the field Against the demi-goddess girt with angels, Since she has now been used To gaze on spirits tender and benign, Not such as I, of semblance rough and fierce, For battles born to subjugate the sky. In human form I would not Defy her to a great important conflict, The world she knows contains one only man. Nor would I of the tiger Or the imperious lion Or other animal assume the shape; For well she knows they could not reason with her, Who are of reason void. To make her knowledge vain, That I exist to the eternal Maker, A source of endless fear, Wrapt in the painted serpent's scaly folds, Part of myself I hide, giving the rest A human semblance and a damsel's face. Great things I tell thee, and behold I see My adversary prompt to parley with me. Of novelty to hear How eager woman is! Now, now I loose my tongue, And shall entangle her in many a snare. Satan. But what discordant sound Rises from hell, where all was lately concord? Why do hoarse trumpets bellow through the deep? SCENE THE FOURTH. Volan, the Serpent, Spirits, Satan. Volan. Great Lord, ordain'd to found infernal realms, And look with scorn upon the pomp of heaven, Behold thy Volan fly To pay his homage at thy scaly feet! The chieftains of Avernus, The prime infernal powers To rise in rivalship Of heaven in all, as in that lofty seat, The Word to us reveal'd, The source of such great strife, They wish, that on the Earth A goddess should prepare a throne for man, And lead him to contemn His own Almighty Maker: Yet more the inhabitants of fire now wish That having conquer'd Man, And with such triumph gay, To the great realms of deep and endless flames Ye both with exultation may descend: Then shall I see around Hell dart its rays, and hold the sun in scorn. But if this man resist, Then losing every hope Of farther victory, They wish that on the throne Of triumph he may as a victor sit, Who teaches it to move, And thou perform the office With an afflicted partner, With him, who labours to conduct the car; That clothed in horrid pomp The region of Avernus, May speak itself the seat of endless pain, And at the sound of inauspicious trumpets The heavens may shake, the universe re-echo. SCENE THE FIFTH. Vain Glory drawn by a Giant, Volan, the Serpent, Satan, and Spirits. Vain Glory. King of Avernus, at this harp's glad sound I weave a starry garland for thy locks, For well I see thy lovely scales portend Honour to me, ruin and shame to man. I am Vain Glory, and I sit on high, Exulting Victress of the mighty Giant: He has his front in heaven, on earth his feet, A faithful image of man's mighty worth: But shake not thou with fear! strong as he is So brittle is the crown of glass he wears That at my breath, which drives him fiercely on, Man loses power, and falls a prey to Death. Serpent. Angel, or Goddess, from thy lofty triumph Descend with me at the desire of Hell! Haste to a human conflict; You all so light and quick, That by your movement not a leaf is shaken In all these woods around, Your mighty triumphs now together hide; Now that in silence we may pass unseen, Quick let us enter neighbouring Paradise. Vain Glory. Wherefore delay? Point out the path we go; Since prompt to follow thee, Full as I am of haughtiness and pride, With expeditious foot I will advance Among these herbs and flowers, And let infernal laurels Circle thy towering crest and circle mine! Serpent. What tribes of beauteous flowers, And plants how new and vivid! How desolate shall I Soon make these verdant scenes of plant and flower! Behold! how with my foot I now as much depress them, As they shoot forth with pride to rear their heads: Behold! their humid life I wither with my step of blasting fire. How I enjoy, as I advance through these Fair bowers of rapid growth, To poison with my breath the leaf and flower, Embittering all these sweet and blooming fruits. We are arrived, behold the lovely tree Prohibited by heaven, There mount, and be embower'd In the thick foliage of a wood so fair! Vain Glory. See, I prepare to climb: I am already high, And in the leaves conceal'd. Climb thou, great chief, and rapidly encircle, And with thy scaly serpent train ascend The tree; be quick, since now arising higher I can discern where lonely Eve advances. Serpent. Behold, enraged I twine around the trunk With these my painted and empoison'd folds; Behold, I breathe towards this woman, love, Though hate is in my heart: Behold me now; more beautiful than ever, Though now of each pestiferous cruel monster In poison and in rage, I am the model; Now I behold her, now In silence I conceal my gift of speech, Among these leaves embower'd. SCENE THE SIXTH. Eve, Serpent, and Vain Glory. Eve. I ought, the servant of a Mighty Lord, A servant low and humble, With reverential knee bending to earth, I ought to praise the boundless love of him, Since he has made me queen Of all the sun delights to view on earth. But if to heaven I raise my eyes and heart, Clearly can Eve not see She was created for these great, eternal, Celestial miracles? So that in spirit or in mortal frame, She ever must enjoy or earth or heaven. Hence this fair flowering tree Wreathing abroad its widely branching arms, As if desirous to contend with heaven, Seems willing in my locks To spread a shining heaven of verdant leaves; And if I pass among the herbs and flowers, Those, I behold, that by my step are press'd, Arise more beautiful; the very buds Expand, to form festoons To decorate the grassy scene around. Other new flowers with freshest beauty fair, That stand from me sequester'd, Form'd into groups or scatter'd in the vale, Seem with delight to view me, and to say, The neighbouring flowers rejoice To give thy foot support, But we, aspiring Eagles, From far behold thy visage, Mild portraiture of the almighty form. While other plants and flowers, Wishing that I may form my seat among them, Above their native growth So seem to raise themselves, that of sweet flowers A fragrant hedge they form; And others in a thousand tender ties, Form on the ground so intricate a snare, That the incautious hand which aims to free The captive foot, must be itself ensnared. If food I wish, or draught, Lo! various fruit, lo! honey, milk, and manna; Behold, from many a fount and many a rill, The crystal beauty of the cooling stream. If melody, behold the tuneful birds, Behold angelic bands! If welcome day, Or mild and wish'd-for night, Behold the sun, behold the moon and stars! If I a friend require, Adam, sweet friend, replies; And if my God in heaven, the Eternal Maker Dwells not unmindful, but regards my speech. If creatures subject to my will I wish, Lo! at my side all subject to my will. What more can I desire, what more obtain? Now nothing more, my Sovereign, Eve is with honour loaded. But what's before me? do I wake or dream? Among these boughs I see A human visage fair; what! are there then. More than myself and Adam, Who view the glorious sun? O marvellous, though I am distant far, I yet discern the truth; with arms, with hands, A human breast it has, The rest is Serpent all: O, how the sun, emblazing with his rays These gorgeous scales with glowing colours bright, O'erwhelms my dazzled eyes! I would approach it. Serpent. Now, then, at length you see I have precisely ta'en the semblance fit, To overcome this woman. Eve. The nearer I approach, more and more lovely His semblance seems of emerald and sapphire, Now ruby and now amethyst, and now Of jasper, pearl, and flaming chrysolite Each fold it waving forms around the trunk Of this fair flowering tree! Serpent. I will assail my foe. Come to survey me better, Thou dazzler of the eye, Enchantress of the soul, Soft idol of the heart, Fair nymph, approach! Lo, I display myself, Survey me all; now satisfy thine eyes; View me attentive, paragon of beauty, Thou noblest ornament of all the world, Thou lovely pomp of nature, Thou little paradise, To whom all things do homage! Where lonely from thy friend, thy Adam, far Where art thou? now advancing where The numerous bands of Angels Become such fond admirers of thy beauty? Happy I deem myself, supremely happy, Since 'tis my blessed lot, With two fond eyes alone to gaze on that, Which with unnumber'd eyes, heaven scarce surveys. Trust me if all the loveliness of heaven Would wrap itself within a human veil, Nought but thy beauteous bosom Could form a mansion worthy such a guest. How well I see, full well That she above with thy light agile feet, Imprints her step in heaven, and there she smiles With thy enchanting lip, To scatter joy around those blessed spheres; Yes, with thy lips above, She breathes, she speaks, she pauses, And with thine eyes communicates a lustre To all that's fair in heaven or fair on earth. Eve. And who art thou, so eager To lavish praise on me? Yet never did mine eyes see form like thine. Serpent. Can I be silent now? Too much, too much, I pant To please the lovely model of all grace. Know when the world was fashion'd out of nought, And this most fruitful garden, I was ordain'd to dwell a gardener here, By him who cultivates The fair celestial fields; Here joyful I ascend, To watch that no voracious bird may seize On such delicious fruit; Here it is my delight, Though all be marvellously fair around, Lily to blend with lily, rose with rose, And now the fragrant hedge To form, and now between the groups of flowers, And o'er the tender herb To guide the current of the chrystal stream. Oh what sweet scenes to captivate the eye Of such a lovely virgin, Will I disclose around; Thou, if thou canst return To this alluring spot, And ever with fresh myrtle and new flowers, More beauteous thou shalt find it; This wondrous faculty I boast infused By thy supernal Maker, To guard in plant and flower their life and fragrance. Eve. Since I have found thee courteous No less than wise, reveal to me thy name; Speak it to me, unless I seek to know too much. Serpent. Wisdom, I name myself, Sometimes I Life am call'd, For this my double nature, since I am One part a serpent and the other human. Eve. Strange things this day I hear; but tell me why Thou serpent art combined with human form? Serpent. I will inform thee; when the sovereign God On nothing resting, yet gave force to all, To balance all things in an even scale The sage of heaven desired, And not from opposite extremities To pass without a medium justly founded: Hence 'tween the brute and man It pleased him to create this serpent kind; And even this participates in reason, And with a human face has human speech. But what can fail to honour with submission, The demi-god of earth? Oh! if proportion'd to thy charms, or equal To the desert of man, You had high knowledge, doubt not but in all Ye would be reckon'd as immortal gods; Since the prime power of lofty science is One of the first and greatest Of attributes divine; Oh, could this be, Descending from the base Of this engaging plant, How as a goddess should I here adore thee! Eve. What, dost thou think so little then the sum Of knowledge given to man? does he not know Of every living herb and flower and plant, Of minerals and of unnumber'd gems, Of fish, of fowl, and every animal, In water or on earth, of fire, of air, Of this fair starry heaven, And of the moon and sun, The virtues most concealed? Serpent. Ah, this is nothing; since it only serves To make the common things of nature known; And I, although I am Greatly inferior in my rank to man, Yet, one by one, even I can number these. More worthy it would be To know both good and ill; This, this is the supreme Intelligence, and mysteries most high, That on the earth would make you like to God. Eve. That which hath power sufficient to impart This knowledge so sublime of good and ill, (But mixt with mortal anguish,) Is this forbidden tree, on which thou sittest. Serpent. And tell me why a law So bitter rises from a fruit so sweet? Where then, where is the sense That you so lately boasted as sublime? Observe, if it be just, That man so brave, so lovely, man that rules The world with skilful hand, man that so much Pleased his creating God, when power almighty Fashion'd the wonders both of earth and heaven, That man at last a little fruit should crush, And all be form'd for nothing, or at best But for a moment's space? No, no, far from thee, far be such a doubt! Let colour to thy cheek, and to thy lip The banish'd rose return! Say,—but I know—thy heart Within thee speaks the language that I speak! Eve. The Lord commanded me I should not taste This fruit; and to obey him is my joy. Serpent. If 'tis forbidden thee To taste a fruit so fair, Heaven does not choose that man should be a God. But thou with courtesy, to my kind voice Lend an attentive ear: say, if your Maker Required such strict obedience, that you might Depend but on his word to move and guard you; Was there not power sufficient in the laws Sublime of hope, of faith, and charity? Why then, fair creature, why, without occasion Thus should he multiply his laws for man, For ever outraging with such a yoke Your precious liberty, and of great lords Making you slaves, nay, in one point inferior Even to the savage beasts, Whom he would not reduce to any law? Who does not know that loading you so much With precepts, he has lessen'd the great blessing Of joyous being, that your God first gave you? Perchance he dreaded that ye soon might grow His equals both, in knowledge, and be Gods? No, for though like to God you might become By such experiment, the difference still Between you must be great, since this your knowledge, And acquisition of divinity, Could be but imitation, and effect Of the first cause divine that dwells above. And can it then be true, That such a vital hand Can do a deadly deed? Oh hadst thou tasted this, how wouldst thou gain Advantage of the Lord, how then with him Would thy conversing tongue, Accuse the latent mysteries of heaven! Far other flowers and other plants, and fields, And elements, and spheres, Far different suns, and different moons, and stars There are above, from those thou viewest here Buried below these; all to thee are near, Observe how near! but at the very distance This apple is from thee. Extend thy hand, Boldly extend it,—ah! why dost thou pause? Eve. What should I do? Who counsels me, O God? Hope bids me live, and fear at once destroys me. But say, how art thou able To know such glorious things exist above, And that on earth, one thus may equal God, By feeding on this apple, If thou in heaven wert never, And ne'er permitted of the fruit to taste? Serpent. Ah! is there ought I can deny to her Whose happiness I wish? Now listen to me. When of this garden I was made the keeper, By him who fashion'd thee, All he has said to thee, to me he said; And opening to me heaven's eternal bosom, With all his infinite celestial pomp, He satiated my eyes, and then thus spake: Thy paradise thou hast enjoy'd, O Serpent, No more thou shalt behold it; now retain Memory of heaven on earth, Which thou may'st do by feeding on such fruit. A heavenly seat alone is fit for man, For that's the seat of beauty; Since thou art partly man, and partly brute, 'Tis just thou dwell on earth; The world was made for various beasts to dwell in, He added, nor canst thou esteem it hard, Serpent and man, to dwell on earth for ever, Since thou already in thy human portion Most fully hast enjoy'd thy bliss above. Thus I eternal live, Forming my banquet of this savoury fruit, And Paradise is open to my eyes, By the intelligence, through me transfused From this delicious viand. Eve. Alas! what should I do? to whom apply? My heart, what is thy counsel? Serpent. 'Tis true, thy sovereign has imposed upon thee, Under the pain of death, To taste not of this fruit; And to secure from thee A dainty so delightful, The watchful guard he made me Of this forbidden tree; So that if I consent, both man and thou, His beautiful companion, May rise to equal God in happiness. 'Tis but too true that to participate In food and beverage with savage beasts, Gives us in this similitude to them; It is not just you both, Works of a mighty Maker, Great offspring of great God, Should in a base condition, Among these groves and woods, Lead a life equal to the lowest beast. Eve. Ah! why art thou so eager That I should taste of this forbidden food? Serpent. Wouldst thou that I should tell? Eve. 'Tis all my wish. Serpent. Now lend thine ear, now arch With silent wonder, both thy beauteous brows! For two proud joys of mine, Not for thy good alone, I wish to make thee This liberal overture, and swear to keep Silence while thou shalt seize the fruit denied. First to avenge that high unworthy wrong Done me by God, in fashioning my shape; For I was deem'd the refuse of his heaven, For these my scaly parts, That ever like a snake I trail behind; And then, because he should to me alone Have given this world, and o'er the numerous beasts Have made me lord, not wholly of their kind; But this my empire mighty and supreme, O'er all these living things, While man is doom'd To breathe on vital air, Must seem but low and servile vassalage; Since man, and only man Was chosen high and mighty lord of all This wondrous scene, and he thus raised to grandeur Was newly form'd of nought. But when the fairest of all Eden's fruits Is snatch'd and tasted, when you rise to Gods, 'Tis just that both ascending from this world, Should reach the higher spheres; So that on earth to make me Of every creature lord, Of human error I my virtue make: Know, that command is grateful even to God, Grateful to man, and grateful to the serpent. Eve. I yield obedience, ah! what is't I do? Serpent. Rather what do you not? Ah, boldly taste, Make me a god on earth, thyself in heaven. Eve. Alas, how I perceive A chilling tremour wander through my bones, That turns my heart to ice! Serpent. It is thy mortal part that now begins To languish, as o'ercome by the divine, Which o'er its lowly partner In excellence ascends. Behold the pleasant plant, More lovely and more rich Than if it raised to heaven branches of gold, And bore the beauteous emerald as leaves, With roots of coral and a trunk of silver. Behold this jewel'd fruit, That gives enjoyment of a state divine! How fair it is, and how It takes new colours from the solar rays, Bright as the splendid train Of the gay peacock, when he whirls it round Full in the sun, and lights his thousand eyes! Behold how it invites! 'Tis all delicious, it is sweetness all: Its charms are not deceitful, Thine eye can view them well. Now take it! Now I watch If any angel spy thee! Dost thou pause? Up! for once more I am thy guide; at last The victory is thine! Eve. At length behold me the exalted mistress Of this most lovely fruit! But why, alas, does my cold brow distil These drops, that overwhelm me? Serpent. Lovely Virgin, Will not our reason tell us Supreme felicity is bought with pain? Who from my brow will wipe These drops of keener pain? Who dissipate the dread that loads my heart? Eve. Tell me what wouldst thou? tell me who afflicts thee? Serpent. The terror of thy Lord; and hence I pray thee That when thou hast enjoy'd That sweet forbidden fruit, When both of you become eternal gods, That you would guard me from the wrath of heaven; Since well indeed may he, Whom we call God, kindle his wrath against me Having to you imparted Taste of this fruit against his high command. But tell him, my desire To make me lord of this inferior world, Like man a god in heaven, Render'd me mute while Eve attain'd the apple. Eve. The gift I owe thee, Serpent, well deserves That I should ne'er forget thee. Serpent. Now in these verdant leaves I hide myself Till thou with sounds of joy Shalt call and re-assure me. Eve. Now then conceal thyself, I promise thee To be thy shield against the wrath of God. O what delicious odour! 'tis so sweet That I can well believe That all the lovely flowers From this derive their fragrance. These dewy leaves to my conception seem Moistened with manna, rather than with dew. Ah, it was surely right That fruit so exquisite Should flourish to impart new life to man, Not waste its sweets upon the wind and sun. Nothing for any ill To man could spring from God's creative hand: Since he for man assuredly has felt Such warmth of love unbounded, I will taste it. How sweet it is! how far Surpassing all the fruits of every kind, Assembled in this soil! But where is Adam now? O, Adam! Adam! He answers not; then thou with speed depart To find him; but among these flowers and leaves Conceal this lovely apple, lest the angels, Descrying it, forbid Adam to taste its sweets, And so from man be made a mighty God. Serpent. Extinguish in the waves thy rays, O sun! Nor more distribute light! Thus Lucifer ordains, and thus the apple! Man, man is now subdued! Vain Glory. O joyous day! O day To Hell of triumph, and of shame to Heaven! Eve has enjoy'd the apple, And now contrives that man may taste it too. Now see by direst fate Life is exchanged for death! Now I exulting sing, And hence depart with pride, Since man's high boast is crush'd, And his bright day now turned to hideous night! ACT THE THIRD. SCENE THE FIRST. Adam and Eve. Oh, my beloved companion! Oh thou of my existence, The very heart and soul! Hast thou, with such excess of tender haste, With ceaseless pilgrimage, To find again thy Adam, Thus solitary wandered? Behold him! Speak! what are thy gentle orders? Why dost thou pause? what ask of God? what dost thou? Eve. Adam, my best beloved! My guardian and my guide! Thou source of all my comfort, all my joy! Thee, thee alone I wish, And in these pleasing shades Thee only have I sought. Adam. Since thou hast call'd thy Adam, (Most beautiful companion,) The source and happy fountain of thy joy; Eve, if to walk with me It now may please thee, I will show thee love, A sight thou hast not seen; A sight so lovely, that in wonder thou Wilt arch thy graceful brow. Look thou, my gentle bride, towards that path, Of this so intricate and verdant grove, Where sit the birds embowered; Just there, where now, with soft and snowy plumes, Two social doves have spread their wings for flight, Just there, thou shalt behold, (oh pleasing wonder,) Springing amid the flowers, A living stream, that with a winding course Flies rapidly away; And as it flies, allures And tempts you to exclaim, sweet river, stay! Hence eager in pursuit You follow, and the stream, as if it had Desire to sport with you, Through many a florid, many a grassy way, Well known to him, in soft concealment flies: But when at length he hears, You are afflicted to have lost his sight, He rears his watery locks, and seems to say, Gay with a gurgling smile, “Follow! ah follow still my placid course! If thou art pleased with me, with thee I sport.” And thus with sweet deceit he leads you on To the extremest bound Of a fair flowery meadow; then at once With quick impediment, Says, “Stop! Adieu! for now, yes, now I leave you:” Then down a rock descends: There, as no human foot can follow farther, The eye alone must follow him, and there, In little space you see a mass of water Collected in a deep and fruitful vale, With laurel crown'd and olive, With cypress, oranges and lofty pines. The limpid water in the sun's bright ray A perfect chrystal seems; Hence in its deep recess, In the translucent wave, You see a precious glittering sand of gold, And bright as moving silver Innumerable fish; Here with melodious notes The snowy swans upon the shining streams Form their sweet residence; And seem in warbling to the wind to say, “Here let those rest who wish for perfect joy!” So that, my dear companion, To walk with me will please thee. Eve. So well thy language to my sight has brought What thou desirest to show me, I see thy flying river as it sports, And hear it as it murmurs. And beauteous also is this scene, where now Pleased we sojourn, and here, perhaps, even here The lily whitens with the purest lustre, And the rose reddens with the richest hue. Here also bathed in dew Plants of minutest growth Are painted all with flowers. Here trees of amplest leaf Extend their rival shades, And stately rise to heaven. Adam. Now by these cooling shades, The beauty of these plants, By these delightful meadows, These variegated flowers, By the soft music of the rills and birds, Let us sit down in joy! Eve. Behold then I am seated! How I rejoice in viewing not alone These flowers, these herbs, these high and graceful plants. But Adam, thou, my lover, Thou, thou art he, by whom the meadows seem More beautiful to me, The fruit more blooming, and the streams more clear. Adam. The decorated fields With all their flowery tribute cannot equal Those lovelier flowers, that with delight I view In the fair garden of your beauteous face. Be pacified, you flowers, My words are not untrue; You shine besprinkled with ethereal dew, You give the humble earth to glow with joy At one bright sparkle of the blazing sun; But with the falling sun ye also fall: But these more living flowers Of my dear beauteous Eve Seem freshen'd every hour By soft devotion's dew, That she with pleasure sheds Praising her mighty Maker: And by the rays of two terrestrial suns In that pure heaven, her face, They rise, and not to fall, Decking the Paradise Of an enchanting visage. Eve. Dear Adam, do not seek With tuneful eloquence To sooth my ear by speaking of thy love! The heart is confident, That fondly flames with pure and hallow'd ardour. In sweet exchange accept, my gentle love, This vermeil-tinctured gift, you know it well; This is the fruit forbidden, This is the blessed apple. Adam. Alas! what see I! ah! what hast thou done, Invader of the fruit, Forbidden by thy God? Eve. It would be long to tell thee The reason that induced me To make this fruit my prey: let it suffice, I gain'd thee wings to raise thy flight to Heaven. Adam. Ne'er be it true, ah never That to obtain thy favour, I prove to Heaven rebellious and ungrateful, And to obey a woman, So disobey my Maker and my God! Then did not death denounced With terror's icy paleness blanch thy cheek? Eve. And think'st thou, if the apple Were but the food of death, The great producer would have raised it there, Where being is eternal? Thinkst thou, that if of error This fruit-tree were the cause, In man's delighted eye So fertile and so fair, He would have form'd it flourishing in air! Ah, were it so, he would indeed have given A cause of high offence, Since nature has ordain'd, (A monitress sagacious,) That to support his being, man must eat, And trust in what looks fair, as just and good. Adam. If the celestial tiller, Who the fair face of Heaven Has thickly sown with stars, Amidst so many plants fruitful and fair, Placed the forbidden apple, The fairest and most sweet, 'Twas to make proof of man, As a wise keeper of his heavenly law, And to afford him scope for high desert; For he alone may gain the name of brave, Who rules himself and all his own desires. Man might indeed find some excuse for sin, If scantily with fruits This garden were supplied; But this abounding in so many sweets, Man ought not to renounce The clear command of Heaven. Eve. And is it thus you love me? Ne'er be it true, ah never, That I address you as my heart, my life! From you I'll only wander, Bathed in my tears, and sighing, And hating even myself, I'll hide me from the sun. Adam. Dear Eve! my sweetest love! My spirit and my heart! Oh haste to dry thine eyes, For mine are all these tears That bathe thy cheek, and stream upon thy bosom. Eve. Ah, my unhappy state! I that so much have said, so much have done To elevate this man Above the highest Heaven, and now so little Can he or trust or love me! Adam. Ah, do not grieve, my life! Too much it wounds my soul To see thee in affliction. Eve. I know your sole desire Is to be witness to my sighs and tears; Hence to the winds and seas I pay this bitter tribute. Adam. Alas! my heart is splitting. What can I do? When I look up to heaven, I feel an icy tremor Even to my bones oppress me, Anxious alone to guard the Heavenly precept: If I survey my partner, I share her tears and echo back her sighs. 'Tis torture and distraction To wound her with refusal: my kind heart Would teach my opening hand to seize the apple, But in my doubtful breast My spirit bids it close. Adam! thou wretch! how many Various desires besiege thy trembling heart! One prompts thee now to sigh, Another to rejoice; nor canst thou know Which shall incline thee most, Or sighs, or joyous favour, From woman, or from God. Eve. Yet he reflects, and wishes That Eve should now forsake Her hope of being happy In elevating man, Even while I hold the fruit of exaltation! Adam. Though mute, yet eloquent Are all your looks, my love; Alas! whate'er you ask You're certain to obtain; And my heart grants, before your tongue can speak. Eyes, that to me are suns, The Heaven of that sweet face No more, no more obscure! Return! alas! return To scatter radiance o'er that cloudy cheek! Lift up, O lift thy brow From that soft mass of gold that curls around it, Locks like the solar rays, Chains to my heart and lightning to my eyes! O let thy lovely tresses, Now light and unconfined, Sport in the air and all thy face disclose, That paradise, that speaks a heart divine! I yield thee full obedience; Thy prayers are all commands: Dry, dry thy streaming eyes, and on thy lips Let tender smiles like harmless lightning play! Eve. Ah, misbelieving Adam, Be now a kind receiver Of this delightful fruit! Hasten, now hasten to extend thy hand To press this banquet of beatitude! Adam. Oh, my most sweet companion, Behold thy ardent lover! Now banish from his heart The whirlpool of affliction, turn'd to him His dearest guide, his radiant polar star! Show me that lovely apple, Which 'midst thy flowers and fruits, Ingenious plunderer, thou hidest from me! Eve. Adam, behold the apple! What say'st thou? I have tasted, and yet live. Ah 'twill insure our lives, And make us equal to our God in Heaven. But first the fruit entire We must between us eat, And when we have enjoy'd it, Then to a radiant throne, a throne of stars, Exalting Angels will direct our flight. Adam. Give me the pilfer'd fruit, Thou courteous pilferer! Give me the fruit that charms thee, And let me yield to her, Who to make me a God has toil'd and wept! Alas! what have I done? How sharp a thorn is piercing to my heart With instantaneous anguish! How am I o'erwhelm'd In a vast flood of sorrow! Eve. Alas! what do I see? Oh bitter knowledge! unexpected sight! All is prepared for human misery. Adam. O precious liberty! where art thou fled? Eve. O precious liberty! O dire enthralment! Adam. Is this the fruit so sweet, The source of so much bitter? Say why wouldst thou betray me? Ah why of heaven deprive me! Why make me forfeit thus My state of innocence, Where cheerful I enjoy a blissful life? Why make me thus a slave To the fierce arms of death, Thou, whom I deem'd my life? Eve. I have been blind to good, Quick-sighted but to evil, An enemy to Adam, A rebel to my God, For daring to exalt me To the high gates of heaven, I fall presumptuous to the depths of hell. Adam. Alas, what dart divine appears in heaven, Blazing with circling flame? Eve. What punishment, Wretch that I am, hangs o'er me? Am I naked! And speaking still to Adam? Adam. Am I too naked? hide me! hence! Eve. I fly. SCENE THE SECOND. Volano. Thou'rt fallen, at length thou'rt fallen, O thou presuming With new support from the resplendent stars, To mount to seats sublime! Adam, at length thou'rt fallen to the deep, As far as thy ambition hoped to soar: Now see thou hast attain'd To learn the distance between heaven and hell. Now let Avernus echo, To the hoarse sound of the funereal trumpet! Joyful arise to light, And pay your homage to the prince of hell! SCENE THE THIRD. Satan, Volano, Chorus of Spirits, with their flags flying and infernal instruments. Volano. Man is subdued, subdued! Palms of eternal glory! Why pause ye now? to your infernal reeds And pipes of hoarsest sound, with pitch cemented, And various instruments of discord, Now let the hand and lip be quick applied! Behold how triumph now to us returns, As rightly he foretold Our Stygian Emperor! Spread to the wind Your fluttering banners! Oh thou festive day To Hell of glory, and to Heaven of shame! SCENE THE FOURTH. Serpent, Vain Glory, Satan, Volano, and Spirits. Serpent. To pleasures and to joys, Ye formidable dark sulphureous warriors! Let Fame to heaven now on her raven plumes Direct her rapid flight, Of Man's completed crime The mournful messenger. Satan. Behold, again expanded in the air The insignia of hell! Hear now the sounds of triumph, And voices without number That raise to heaven the shout of victory! Serpent. Lo, I return, ye Spirits of Avernus, And as I promised, a proud conqueror! Lo, to these deep infernal realms of darkness I bring transcendent light, transcendent joy; Thanks to my fortitude, which from that giant Now wretched, and in tears, Forced his aspiring crown of fragile glass; And thanks to her, this martial heroine, Vain Glory, whom to my proud heart I press. Satan. The torrent hastes not to the sea so rapid, Nor yet so rapid in the realm of fire Flashes kindle and die, As the quick circling hours Of good are join'd to evil In life's corrupted state; The work of my great Lord, nor less the work Of thee, great Goddess of the scene condemn'd; Up, up with homage quick To show ourselves of both the blest adorers! Serpent. Now, from their bended knees let all arise, And to increase our joys Let thy glad song, Canoro, Now memorize the prosperous toil of hell. Canoro. Happy Canoro, raised to matchless bliss, Since 'tis thy lot to speak The prosperous exploits of Lucifer! Behold, I bend the knee, And sing thy triumph in a joyous strain; Behold, the glorious triumph Of that unconquer'd power, Who every power surpasses, The mighty monarch of the deadly realm! Now raise the tumid form, Avernus, banish grief; Man is involved in snares, And Death is glutted with his frail existence. This is the potent, brave, And ancient enemy Of man, the dauntless foe, And dread destroyer of the starry court. No more contentment dwell In the terrestrial seat: Thou moon, and sun, be darken'd, And every element to chaos turn! Man is at length subdued. From a corrupted source, A weak and hapless offspring, Thanks to the fruit, his progeny shall prove. To that exalted seat By destiny our due, Can Death's vile prey ascend, Who now lies prostrate at the feet of Hell? Serpent. Silence, no more! Now in superior joys Ye quick and fluttering spirits, Now, now, your wings expand, And active in your pleasure, Weave a delightful dance! SCENE THE FIFTH. A Chorus of Sprights in the shape of Antics, Serpent, Satan, Volan, Canoro, Vain Glory, and Spirits. To thee behold us flying, Round thee behold us sporting, O monarch of Avernus! To recreate thy heart in joyous dance. Come, let us dance, happy and light, Ye little Sprights; Man was of flesh, now all of dust, Such is the will of hideous Death; A blessed lot No more is his, wretched in all. Now let us weave, joyous and dancing, Ties as many, As now Hell's prosperous chieftain Spreads around man, who weeps and wails, And now lifeless, Is almost render'd by his anguish. Enjoy, enjoy in fragile vesture, Man, O heaven; Stygian Serpent has o'erwhelm'd him, Wherefore let each dance in triumph, Full of glory, Since our king has proved victorious. But, what think'st thou Heaven in sorrow? On the sudden, He will spring to scenes celestial; And he there will wreak his vengeance On the Godhead, That is now in heaven so troubled. Serpent. Ah, what lofty sounding trumpets Through the extensive fields of heaven rebellow? Vain Glory. Ah, from my triumph now I fall to hell, Through subterraneous scenes exhaling fire, With all my fatal pomp at once I sink! Serpent. And I alas, am plunging With thee to deepest horror! Satan. Avoid, avoid, companions, This unexpected lustre, That brings, alas, to us a night of horror! Volano. Alas, why should we tarry? Fly all, O fly with speed This inimical splendour, These dread and deadly accents, The utterance of God! SCENE THE SIXTH. God the Father, Angels, Adam, and Eve. GOD THE FATHER. And is it thus you keep the law of heaven, Adam and Eve? O ye too faithless found, Ye children of a truly tender father! Thou most unhappy, how much hast thou lost, And in a moment, Adam! Fool, to regard the Serpent more than God. Ah could repentance e'er belong to Him Who cannot err, then might I well repent me Of having made this man. Now, Adam, thou hast tasted The apple, thou hast sinn'd, Thou hast corrupted God's exalted bounty: The elements, the heavens, The stars, the moon, the sun, and whatsoever Has been for man created, Now seems by man abhorr'd, and as unworthy Now to retain existence, To his destruction he solicits death. But since 'tis just that I, who had proportion'd Reward to merit, should now make chastisement Keep pace with guilt, contemplating myself, I view Astrea, in whose righteous stroke Lo, I myself descend, for I am justice. Why pausest thou, O sinner, in his presence, Who on a starry throne, As an offended judge prepares thy sentence? Appear! to whom do I address me? Adam, Adam, where art thou? say! dost thou not hear? Adam. Great Sovereign of Heaven! if to those accents, Of which one single one form'd earth and heaven, My God, if to that voice, That call'd on Adam, a deaf asp I seem'd, It was terror struck me dumb: Since to my great confusion, I was constrain'd, naked, to come before thee. GOD THE FATHER. And who with nakedness has made acquainted Him, who although he was created naked, With innocence was clothed? Adam. Of knowledge the dread fruit that I have tasted; The fault of my companion! Eve. Too true it is, that the malignant serpent, Made me so lightly think of thy injunction, That the supreme forbiddance Little, or nought I valued. GOD THE FATHER. Adam, thou sinner! O thou bud corrupted By the vile worm of error! Though eager to ascend celestial seats, An angel in thy pride, thy feeble wings Left thee to fall into the depths of hell. By thy disdain of life, Death is thy acquisition; Unworthy now of favour, I strip thee of thy honours; And soon thou shalt behold the herbs and flowers Turn'd into thorns and thistles, The earth itself this day by me accurst. Then shalt thou utter sighs in want of food, And from thy alter'd brow thou shalt distil Streams of laborious sweat, A supplicant for bread; Nor ever shall the strife of man have end, Till, as he rose from dust, to dust he turn. And thou, first author of the first offence, With pain thou shalt produce the human birth, As thou hast taught, with anguish infinite, The world this fatal day to bring forth sin. Thee, cruel Serpent, I pronounce accursed; Be it henceforth thy destiny to creep Prone on the ground, and on the dust to feed. Eternal strife between thee and the woman, Strife barbarous and deadly, This day do I denounce: If one has fallen, the other, yet victorious, Shall live to bruise thy formidable head. Now, midst the starry spheres, Myself I will seclude from human sight. SCENE THE SEVENTH. An Angel, Adam, and Eve. Angel. Ah Eve, what hast thou lost, Of thy dread Sovereign slighting the commands! Thou Adam, thou hast sinn'd; And Eve too sinning with thee, Ye have together, of the highest heaven Shut fast the gates, and open'd those of hell! In seeking sweeter life, Ye prove a bitter death; And for a short delight A thousand tedious sufferings. How much it had been better for this man To say, I have offended, pardon, Lord! Than to accuse his partner, she the serpent: Hence let these skins of beasts, thrown over both, Become your humble clothing; And hence let each be taught That God approves the humble, And God in anger punishes the proud. Adam. O man! O dust! O my frail destiny! O my offence! O death! Eve. O woman! O of evil Sole gluttonous producer! O fruit! my sin! O serpent! O deceit! Angel. Now let these skins that you support upon you, Tell you the grievous troubles That you have to sustain; Rude vestments are these skins, From whence you may perceive That much of misery must be endured Now in the field of life, Till death shall reap ye both. Now, now lament and weep, From him solicit mercy, For still your mighty Maker may be found Gracious in heaven, indulgent to the world, Most merciful to man, If equal to the pride That made him err, his penitence will weep. Adam. Ah whither art thou fled? Where lonely dost thou leave me? O too disgusting apple, If thou canst render man to angels hateful. Alas, my dread destruction Springs from a source so high, That it will find no end. Most miserable Adam! if thou fallest, Ah, who will raise thee up? If those eternal hands That should uphold the heaven, the world, and man, Closed for thy good, are open for thy ill, How much should'st thou express! but tears and grief Fetter the tongue and overwhelm the heart! O sin! O agony! Eve. Adam, my Adam, I will call thee mine, Although I may have lost thee! Unhappy Eve acknowledges her error, She weeps, and she laments it. She sees thee in great anguish: O could her tears wash out the grievous stain Thou hast upon thy visage! Adam! alas thou answerest not, and I Suffer in seeing thee so pale and pensive, Thy hands united in the folds of pain! But if through deed of mine thou hast occasion For endless shame and silence, Wilt thou reply to me? do I deserve it? I merit only woe by being woman; Eve has invented weeping, Eve has discover'd anguish, Labour and lassitude, Distraction and affright; Eve, Eve has minister'd to death and hell! Adam. Enjoy, enjoy, O woman, My anguish, my perdition, and my death; Banish me hence for loving thee too well! Ah, if thou wert desirous of my tears, Now, now extend thy hands, receive these streams That I must pour abundant from mine eyes; If thou didst wish my sighs, lo sighs I give thee; If anguish, view it; if my blood, 'tis thine; Rather my death, it will be easy to thee Now to procure my death, If thou hast render'd me of life unworthy. [[SCENE THE EIGHTH.]] The Archangel Michael, Adam, and Eve. Michael. Why this delay? come on, be quick, depart, Corrupted branches, from this fair and beauteous Terrestrial paradise! Are ye so bold, Ye putrid worms? come on, be quick, depart, Since with a scourge of fire I thus command you. Adam. Alas! I am destroy'd By the fierce blow of this severe avenger! Eve. Now sunk in vital power I feel my sad existence, E'en at the menace from this scourge of fire. Michael. These stony plains now must thy naked foot Press, in the stead of sweet and beauteous flowers, Since thy erroneous folly Forbids thy dwelling in this pleasant garden. Behold in me the punisher of those Who against their God rebel, and hence I bear These radiant arms that with tremendous power Make me invincible. I was the spirit Who, in the mighty conflict, Advancing to the north, Struck down great Lucifer, the haughty leader Of wicked angels, so that into hell They plunged precipitate and all subdued; And thus it has seem'd good to my tremendous Celestial chief, that I shall also drive Man, rebel to his God, with this my sword Of ever blazing fire, Drive him for ever from this seat of bliss. You angels all depart, and now with me Expand your plumes for heaven; As it has been your lot, Like mine, on earth here to rejoice with man, Man once a demi-god and now but dust, Here soon with falchions arm'd, Falchions that blaze with fire, As guardians of these once delightful gates The brave and active Cherubim shall aid you. SCENE THE NINTH. Chorus of Angels that sing, Archangel, Adam, and Eve. Adieu, remain in peace! O thou that livest in war! Alas, how much it grieves us, Great sinner, to behold thee now but dust. Weep! weep! indulge thy sighs, And view thy lost possession now behind thee; Weep! weep! for all thy sorrow Thou yet may'st see exchanged for songs of joy: This promise to the sinner Heaven affords Who contrite turns to Heaven with holy zeal. ACT THE FOURTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Volan, Chorus of Fiery, Airy, Earthly, and Aquatic Spirits. Volan. Forth from a thousand clouds of flame and smoke, From the deep bosom of the spacious earth, I to these scenes a messenger return. Now to the fatal sound Of these entwisted pipes, By hissing snakes united, And all attuned to the fierce notes of death, Now cease, now cease ye all, Ye potent spirits, to reside in fire, Or in the air, in water, or in earth. Appear! why pause ye? such is the command Of your brave emperor, the chief of hell. Hark! hear ye not the sound That calls you forth from out your various dwellings? Behold! how from the sphere of blazing fire Arsiccio, of the blazing legion prince, Comes to pay homage to his mighty lord. Arion. Lo, from the field of air I too descend, I who am called Arion, The mighty ruler of this winged band, At the command of hell. Tarpalce. Of the infernal palace To bend before the prince, Forth from a thousand subterraneous paths The great Tarpalce, chief of earthy sprights, Raises his brow to heaven. Ondoso. From many a vein of water, From many a rising fount, From rills, and rivers, torrents, floods, and streams, And from a thousand marshes, pools, and lakes, Such as I am, Ondoso, of soft spirits The humid, floating ruler, now on wing, Here even I attend, to reverence The subterranean power. Volan. Lo, from the dark abyss to lightsome air, Great Lucifer now rising, and with him The most sagacious band Of hellish counsellors. SCENE THE SECOND. Lucifer, Fiery, Airy, Earthly, Aquatic, Infernal Spirits, and Volano. Lucifer. Ah light! detested light! Yet once again I look toward thy rays, The sightless mole of hell, And like a frantic angel, Dazzled and grieved at heart, Immortally I die. Beliar. Of what dost thou complain? why grieves our god? Clear up thy countenance, and see around How thy palms shake; thy banners float in air, Signs of that valour which has conquer'd heaven, And now in triumph may enjoy the world; Ah too imperfect is the victor's glory, If he exult not in his victory. Lucifer. Destructive victory! unworthy boast! Laughter to weeping turn'd, Is that which thou esteem'st the praise of hell. Ah, Heaven's high power has found A new expedient, to our endless shame, To make our vanquished foe remain the victor, And triumph, though defeated. Mirim. What barbed arrows in my wounded heart, Great Lord, hast thou enfixt! Lucifer. Ah! for no other purpose have I called you From realms of air and fire, From earth, from water, and the central depths, Save that we might project in council here How man may fall entirely overwhelm'd, If to destroy him by the fruit I fail'd. Digrignan. Ah how can Adam live, If he indeed has eat the fruit forbidden, Condemning him to death? Now well may we exclaim, That Heaven this day inures itself to falsehood. Lucifer. Hear it, oh hell, and shudder at the sound, And let thy lively joys now turn to languor. Tell me, thou Beliar, how seems to thee, After the tasted fruit, man on the sudden Discover'd naked, and amid the branches Of thickest growth hastening to hide his shame? Beliar. In viewing his own nakedness, he shews us The tasted fruit has robb'd him of all grace; The very foliage where he hides informs him He is become a beast, And, like a beast, is doom'd in death to lose His body and his soul. Lucifer. Thou, Coriban, relate why man has form'd With the fig's ample leaf A mantle for his waist. Coriban. I'll tell you, 'tis the nature of the fig To rise not high, and prove of short duration; Still less may man expect to glory's height To raise himself; for short shall be his date. All the contentious elements at war, Occasion'd by his sin, now in their conflict Shall overwhelm him, and the hope with souls More to embellish heaven shall be in vain. Lucifer. And thou, Ferea, what denotes the serpent, Whom in his anger God is pleased to curse? Ferea. I will be brief in telling all that's true: When he pronounced a curse upon the serpent, Man had already heard his malediction; And thus to, that he added, Prone on thy belly serpent thou shalt grovel, As if to man suggesting, Dark as a riddling God, man is of clay; And clay shall now be destitute of soul, As destitute of soul each other reptile. Lucifer. Thou, Solobrico, tell me, what think'st thou Of this strange speech to man? Thou by thy sweat must gain The bread that forms thy food. Solobrico. This bread to us discovers The life of man's frail body, A body form'd of earth, as now indeed Grain must be drawn from earth to make this bread The vital element: His sweat denotes the element of water, His countenance is air, his labour fire; So that this dark expression Of being doom'd to gain his bread by sweat, To man says, thou shalt live, In many griefs and troubles, A short space in the world; Then is thy lot to die, Turning again to earth, air, water, fire. Lucifer. And, Gismon, thou, to woman when he said, That with the pangs of birth She should produce her offspring, say what meaning Lurk'd in that new expression to bring forth? Gismon. This said expression birth Denotes the being born, When her young progeny shall rise to light: He also might denote a new partition By this new word bring forth, Innumerable pains, In which the suffering parents Shall both participate to rear their children. Of body and of soul The certain death I see in this expression: That this may be, turning to man he said, That he should die, and then to Eve he added, That she with bitter anguish should bring forth. Now this mysterious saying nothing means, If not that man is meant By death corporeal, and his frail companion By death that strikes the soul; Thus from mortality, With loss reciprocal, the soul is taken: And thus, when each has languish'd, The body in its dying, The soul in its departure, Leaving at length its transient dear abode; So verified shall be the mighty sentence From him, the mighty judge, Of bringing forth with dire excess of pain. Lucifer. All you, that most sagacious I reckon'd once in my infernal kingdoms, I find now least sagacious. To thee I turn, Arsiccio, tell me now What means that mystery, The cursing of the earth? Arsiccio. And to the blame of man I too return; Can it be true this cursing of the earth? What does the mystery mean? Means it indeed the earth? Foolish is he who thinks so! what offence Has she committed? no 'twas not the earth Was cursed, but only man, who is of earth; And human nature all is cursed with him; And that decree, it should no more bear fruit Was utter'd for no purpose But to proclaim to man, That, as a sinner, heaven is shut against him. Lucifer. Arion, thou exalt thyself in air; Do thou inform me why with skins of beasts This man and his companion were array'd. Arion. This clearly shows to us That God no longer makes account of man. Hear me, unconquer'd sovereign, This clothing Adam with the lifeless skins Of fleeced animals to us imports, That, as with dying beast, The body, soul, and spirit, also die, So death shall also prove The dread destroying ravager of men By the dread fruit's effect. Lucifer. Ondoso, thou who art profest a diver, Canst thou pervade the depth Of these confused decrees? inform me now What means the mystery Of cherubim with fiery falchions Forbidding entrance to the gates of Eden. Ondoso. No mystery, great king, But the destruction of the human race, Portended by these falchions. They mean indeed the death Of man's terrestrial form, And their fierce blades of fire Damnation to his soul: So that when struck by death The body shall be ashes, and the soul Shall by eternal justice Within the dark Avernus Become a prisoner, lost to light and heaven. Now blest are we, since we behold it clear, That, rising to the realms above, 'tis ours To make Olympus joyful, since when we Resign'd our seat in heaven, At those exalted gates No armed cherubim was placed to guard; Thus all is justly weigh'd, And in an even balance; For now the world's inhabitants shall be The birds, the fish, the beasts: Of the Tartarean gulf Man, and his numerous race; We only on gay wing shall soar to heaven, On this supreme condition, That heaven's great Lord shall pardon ask of thee, Repenting of his error, and that both Shall rule the realm of heaven, Both Lucifer and God. Lucifer. Tarpalce, say what thinkest thou of man? Tarpalce. 'Tis not my sentiment man can be saved. In short, this man has sinn'd; And he who draws from man his flesh and life, He shall be call'd a sinner; And he who is a sinner shall be damn'd; And since it is denied That these the seats of heaven, that once were ours, Neglected shall be left, and void of glory, Well may we re-ascend, with brave condition, The heaven once more returning to itself. Sufficiently we know It otherways would still be void of splendour, Since God no longer knows What to achieve that may embellish heaven. Lucifer. Alas! 'tis fit that I From a deep silence now Loose this chill'd tongue, chill'd, though it seems to burn With cruel deadly rage! My heart is bursting only at the thought Of what I must relate: Now with great efforts vanquishing myself, Let that be heard which anguish bids me utter! The fear he felt to show himself when naked Was from the mighty shame To see himself bespotted With sin's deformity. His flight with rapid step towards the woods, As to the sea the swollen torrent flies, Denotes his great repentance of his sin. That leafy screen, in which he hid himself, Denotes his coarse and rustic penitence, Till with long abstinence he shall atone With punishment for sin. The harsh and ample leaf Of fig, still more expressive, Tells it will be man's lot With coarse and hairy vest To cover every fault; And as upon the fig, Among its harshest leaves, a dulcet fruit Arises, thus at last shall man himself, Midst all his penitence, enjoy the fruit So sweet and dear of heaven, that he had lost: The verdure of the leaf Affords a certain hope That man may have of God's returning grace; That he at length in heaven Shall know a blooming spring of highest glory. The double summons, thus bestow'd on man, Tells us he shall have time To weep, though sinning, his repented sin. If he was pleased to execrate the serpent, There hell may understand That it was not the serpent Who then offended God; from whence he said Prone on thy belly, serpent, thou shalt creep! Alas, too clearly saying, Quit every hope, O ye that now abide By the infernal streams, Quit every hope of heaven! And when between this woman and the serpent His word denounced, alas! eternal war, Ah then he comprehended human nature, Which bears a female name. What then are now our direst enemies? Inhabitants of heaven! So that our most tormenting adversary Is now no other but this human nature Made an eternal denizen of heaven. What more, alas! have I the force to speak it? The saying that the woman Shall one day bruise his head, With mystery severe Shows us the incarnation of the Word. Saying to man his bread He now by sweat must earn, is it not saying After hard toil thou shalt to heaven ascend? Alas! perhaps it means That bread may life denote, Since man is destined to have life in heaven. If for the apple God was pleased to say That man transgressing shall be doom'd to death, He of the body spake; The spirit is immortal. When in his speech to Eve He doom'd her to bring forth, that indicates Eternity assign'd to human nature. The guard of cherubim that wheel around Their fiery swords, forbidding All feet to tread on that delicious garden, I would declare to mean— But to cold marble turns my faltering tongue. Briar. Shall it be said that Briar checks his tongue? Believe not thou, our Lord, That man to heaven shall soar! Too feeble are his wings; Had he no other bar, I am alone prepared to give him death, Arm'd with a mighty club, or with a stone, Though sure to be condemn'd Myself alone to all the pains of hell; Since I can well discern, That in continual thinking of my glory, Infernal pain will turn to heavenly joy. Lucifer. O noble, generous ardour! Trust me, not less avails A heart magnanimous for glory panting, Than a decided triumph. Let us remain in hell, Since there is more content To live in liberty, though all condemn'd, Than, as his vassals, blest. Up from these filthy dregs, A hideous mass, sulphureous, rough, and round, Let there be raised to light; So wills the mighty chieftain of damnation. SCENE THE THIRD. The infernal Cyclops, armed with Hammers, and all those of the preceding Scene. Behold the smiths of hell, That, worn with toil and smoke, To heaven are raising this enormous ball, Now fashion'd in Avernus. Lucifer. Now as a perfect rival Of God, I will, that Lucifer be seen. He highly seated, on his throne in heaven, To us reveal'd the world, and thence arose Our banishment from heaven, and I this day, Raising Vain Glory to a throne of splendour, Have now contrived to exterminate mankind. If he from nothing made the ample world, I too a nothing will now make of worlds, Or of the world a nothing. Now let this dark and misty mass dissolve, And in the place of elements, and heavens, Of all the stars, the moon, and radiant suns, Let there come forth a strange unfinish'd monster. Ondoso. O what a stormy burst, what monsters rise, All horrible and hissing, With forms enormous howling, And breathing blasts of fire! Lucifer. Thou that now seem'st a dark and hideous monster, I will array thee in a human semblance, Though but of vapour form'd; Thou shalt be call'd the World. Instead of shags, and vestments wild, Sweat thou beneath a load of gems and gold, For well I know how henceforth in my service Gold may be used in tempting man to sin. Such thou shalt have around thee; On thee I will bestow voice, gesture, snares, In strictest tie to catch The human foot of clay that walks incautious; And all that thou canst wish To overwhelm this man, all thou shalt have. Thou beast of monstrous shape, Thou like a lovely damsel shalt appear, Thou shalt be call'd the Flesh, With wiles, deceits, and ardours in thy train, Whence man may fall in unbecoming errors; And, monster, thou that art So hideous and so meagre, Death be call'd: Be thou all human bone, All ice, all madness, all a mass of horror To the unhappy sinner. Ye four terrific forms, of wildest semblance, For horrid deeds I chuse you, Ill omen'd words, and acts of cruel nature, Your fashion to display. Up, up, let each return To his own element, his proper sphere! Come! why delay to fire? Haste all with me, And hence in silence glide, Abandoning the light. SCENE THE FOURTH. Adam. Wretch that thou art! now cast thine eyes around, No longer shalt thou see Aught to console thy pain. Ah! in that very thought, Sorrow so wounds my heart, My tears so overwhelm me, That in a sigh I seem to breathe my last. Where, Adam, is thy beauty? where thy grace, That made thee dear to angels and to God? Ah! thou alone hast dared To stain thy nature, and to wound thy soul! Is this, is this the way To please that Being who on thee bestow'd Whate'er thou seest around thee, with a promise To give thee in the stars a heavenly mansion? Rather on fruit forbidden To feed, than on the living words of God Has been thy choice; and lo, Thou from an angel to a beast art changed! And, more than other beasts, Driven as a monster from this pleasant garden, And thus in skins array'd; alas! I dare not Lift up my eyes to heaven, yet it becomes me, Low on my knees, to view the good I lost, And in lamenting say, Dear seat of God, thou should'st have been the seat Of Adam also; but thou art lost to me; Thee have I lost, alas! and found in stead Of thee, both death and hell. O hide, in pity hide thy splendour, Heaven! Since Adam is a sinner. Conceal your light, ye stars; Vanish, thou moon and sun; Eternal horror be the fate of man, Since Adam is a sinner. Now in the faithful choir of angels cease Ye soothing melodies, Since Adam is a sinner. Behold, with pain behold, How, from thy dread offence, All things this day appear to change their form, All hold thee in abhorrence, All from thy aspect fly! Ah, thou mayst well exclaim, There, from the verdant stem and parent tree, The rose is fled, and leaves thee but the thorn! There sinks each flower, within the grassy earth Hiding its head precipitate, and scarce Where it display'd its pride now shews its stalk: Well mayst thou add, in plucking here the apple Thou gavest a fatal shake to every tree, Then bringing to the ground Each leaf, each flower, and every blooming fruit. Ah, how despoil'd and waste All now appears to me; all shade and horrors; Produced by man's rebellion to his God. Where, where are now the gay and sprightly birds That on their painted plumes Round me were used to sport and flutter here? Ah, your closed wings I see Amidst the thickest leaves, and fearing all The deadly snares of Adam. Where, where is now the tiger, bear, and lion, The wolf, the pard, and thousand other beasts, Obedient all to man, and in his train? Alas! now made voracious Of human carnage and of smoking blood I now behold you all, Sharpening 'gainst man the talon and the tooth. Where now, ah where, their young May all the fleecy kind Let fall in safety? for, alas, I see No longer will they offer Their milky dugs to thee, their dugs or offspring, Since to escape from man, Now, now, I see them eager, Man turn'd into a wolf By having seized an apple. All fly, and all abhor thee, And from thee, barbarous, learn barbarity. Hence in the earth and sea, Beyond their custom, now All fish, and all the beasts, To battle seem to invite thee; See now the wolf and lamb, She who of late not far from him might wander, See how she bleating flies from his unfaithful Tusk, now expecting bloody violence! Behold the hare, behold How timid she is made, and the dog fierce In striving for her life, While more than native fear to flight inclines her. Behold that dusky beast, That with white tusks of an enormous size Extends its weighty jaw, That now forgetting to revere the moon, Intractable, ferocious Beyond its native temper, Rushes in anger with its fibrous trunk That serves it for a nose, Against the horn which the rhinoceros Sharpens of hardest stone! Behold the sea enraged, Now by thy rage, the very sea inflamed Takes up the fish within its watery arms, And in a thousand caverns, Against the mossy stones Now strikes, and now entombs them. At length, behold that ox, That now beneath thy crooked yoke of wood To turn the sterile earth Thou must contrive to couple, See how he darts an eye of fire upon thee, And foaming now, and panting, fiercely points His crooked horn, and threatens thee with death. And more, yet more, the Earth Provokes thee now to conflict, Thanks to thy dire offence; And since her bosom must by thee be wounded, Strives with thee for thy viands, arm'd herself With thistles and with thorns. I've sinn'd, O Lord, I've sinn'd! I've sinn'd, and for my fault My mournful heart in weeping I distill. Why wretched do I speak? see what a band Of beasts made barbarous, Of hostile beasts, now wet With crimson's deadly stain, I see around me, darting from their caves! Alas! what see I more? wretch that I am! Behold, from them affrighted Eve is flying! SCENE THE FIFTH. Adam and Eve. Eve. Ah whither shall I fly? and where conceal me? Adam. Haste to my arms, O haste! Let him who sinn'd like thee, Like thee become of savage beasts the prey! Eve. Ah, every path becomes The pass of death to one of life unworthy; Here in this cavern's depth, Here let us plunge, O Adam. Adam. Ah, they at length depart; yet not from man Will misery depart, or mortal anguish. Oh wonderous wretchedness, e'en pleasure weeps, Joy wears the form of sorrow, And life itself now dies. Eve. Ah, how I grieve, O Adam! O Heaven! what tears I shed, How do I sigh, O God, wounded in heart, Now, nor alive nor dead. Adam. But hark, what horrid roarings Make air rebellow, and the vallies shake. SCENE THE SIXTH. Famine, Thirst, Lassitude, Despair, Adam, and Eve. Famine. In vain from our quick grasp You strive to fly, vile offspring of the earth, And from the thousand ills that Heaven intends thee; Fly not, for 'tis in vain. Ye now around Block up the paths, and guard each avenue! Famine am I, who in this hideous form Now shew myself to man, To prove how keen I am, With bitterness to poison all his sweets; And from the semblance I reveal, thou wretch, Clearly shalt thou perceive, Beyond all other creatures, How sharply Famine's piercing shaft shall wound thee; And as I now devour these tender shoots Of the young fruitful vine, And suck, with eager thirst, the dulcet juice, So from thy feeble bones, that now derive Infirmity from sin, Soon will I tear the flesh, And suck thus fiercely from thy veins the blood. And this fierce monster that you now behold, Keen at the limpid fountain To satiate its thirst, and foil'd, attempting With harpy talon to pollute the water, This is call'd Thirst; and now, in such a form, Both horrible and fierce, To thee appears, that thou may'st comprehend How wildly raging thou shalt feel its fury. And this is Lassitude, That Lassitude which now on thee shall pour The mighty streams of sorrow. See how her figure melts in drops of anguish, In raising on her back That heavy burden of enormous weight! 'Tis hers to make thee, Adam, So worn with toil, that from thy pallid visage The copious streams of painful sweat shall pour; And Lassitude shall so annoy thy frame, That thou shalt hate thy life. Hence at the last, perforce ye both shall pass Through unaccustom'd ways of wretchedness To this dire monster, savage and tremendous, Who henceforth on the earth Shall bear of Desperation The desperate name; look, and behold how fiercely He in convulsion rolls, and shrieks and roars; See how he tears his hair and grinds his teeth, Wounds all his frame, and makes his breast re-echo With his repeated blows! This fierce, relentless monster Shall so afflict thee, that thou shalt be eager To turn, and hasten to an end more wretched: And if, perchance, thou think'st I speak not true, See him, who from his deep and dark domain In blackest vapour wrapt, Circled with globes of fire, appears before thee! SCENE THE SEVENTH. Death, Adam, and Eve. Death. Thou art the creature, Woman, Who first hast summon'd me, And with a sinful voice, From the Tartarean shades; Thou, perishable flesh and form of clay, Hast call'd this fearful monster, Of human bones compacted, This day to look upon the light of heaven. Say now what wouldst thou speak? Dost thou abhor thy life? Behold the sickle-bearer, and the sickle That now invites thee to desert the day. Now with a lynx's eye, I see, in looking into future time, To my dread name and these ungodly arms, What fatal trophies rise. But what! not here shall end the full perdition With which heaven threatens thee, such mighty evils Hell now prepares for thee, And such excess of horrors, That I, I who am Death, Wish for destruction to escape their sight. Thou art condemn'd to die, Thy residence is Hell, Become a rebel to thy mighty Maker. Adam. Oh source of tears! Oh sorrow! Oh miserable sinner! Eve. Ah me, most wretched Eve! The origin of sin. Adam. Ah, how the heaven grows dark, how it withdraws Its light from us, who are of light unworthy! But ah! what flame in heaven quickens and dies, Dazzling our sight, and sudden darts away, A serpent all of fire? Eve. Alas! not here the wrath of heaven shall end, First we must suffer death. Adam. Ah, what rebellowing sounds I hear above! Perchance with such a voice Offended Heaven now drives us from the world, And sends us banish'd to the gulfs below! What shafts, how numberless Strike down the woods and groves! with what wild force The raging winds contend! Now rushes from the sky Water congeal'd to forceful globes of hail! Eve. Alas! how from on high The swelling waters pour, That rising o'er their banks, The proud o'erflowing rivers Now put the beasts to flight, And in the groves and woods Precipitately drive the fish to dwell. Adam. Fly! let us haste to fly Up to those lofty mountains, Where heaven now seems at last Satiate with ceaseless thundering to repose! ACT THE FIFTH. SCENE THE FIRST. The Flesh and Adam. THE FLESH. If in a bosom form'd in lonely woods, An amorous lure, the engine of deceit, May wake a blazing spark, And raise an inextinguishable fire; This day to me shall shine a day of triumph, When in desire's fierce flames I shall behold that heart, Which love's devouring flame yet has not touch'd. And now if aught of potency resides In golden tresses, or a breast of snow, A radiant eye, a cheek of rose and lily, And teeth of pearl, and lips that vie with coral, In beauty, grace, allurements, arts, and gestures, To make a wretched mortal heart their captive, Such tresses, such a breast, A cheek, and teeth, and lips, And my intelligent engaging manners, Will hold thee fetter'd in a thousand snares. Behold, not distant far, the simple bird I opportunely see, Who for my tempting lure His habitation quits, and his companion, To fall at once by amorous deceit. O how to earth dejected, He bends his watery eyes in deep affliction. Thou art not yet transfix'd By my prevailing shaft, but now it seeks thee. SHE SINGS. Dearest Adam, grieved and fainting, Let my song thy spirit comfort! And with thee, O let me Lead a life of true enjoyment! Gentle Adam, son of glory, Hearken, hearken! meek and humble Sounds the artless song unpolish'd That invites thee But to kindness; Give, O give me ease and quiet, Gentle Adam, son of glory! But if thou with different feelings Wish to wound this tender bosom, See it naked! Strike! O cruel, Wherefore pause you? Haste to kill me! By your hand I fall contented. Adam. O thou all seeing Lord, If real grief may touch thee, Survey the contrite sinner, Who through his eyes distills his heart in tears. No! of thy mercy do not close the hand, Since what sustains me now must fall and perish. Behold, behold, dread Lord! unhappy man, Who from the fatal fruit Has to encounter all the snares of hell: Defend him; he is thine, thine thou hast call'd him, And having once been thine, thou must have loved him. THE FLESH. Go, full of terror and desire! I must With the impetuous be meek and coy, And with the timid bold, and urge him on, Till love's keen canker-worm Prey on the simple heart, That never yet has felt the sting of passion. Adam. Who may this be? alas, both hope and fear Urge me to seek, and bid me still be silent. THE FLESH. This lowliness, and this affected coyness With an undaunted lover, this presumption With one more soft and timid, are so prevailing They seem two strong incentives To kindle the fierce flame of love's desire. Whence I a skilful mistress Brandish my tongue, And give a mortal wound. Say why art thou so pensive, O my most gentle Adam? Adam. Restrain, restrain thy step Whoe'er thou art, nor with thy songs inveigle Him, who has only cause for ceaseless tears. THE FLESH. Without thy strict injunction, Creature of noble semblance, To stand aloof from thee Grieves me; I want the courage to approach The flowery bloom of thy engaging face, Fearing lest serpents in thy radiant eyes, For ever on the watch With stings devoid of pity, pierce my heart. But every bitter root That leads thee to suspicion, I from thy breast will pluck, for know, I am The very soul of love, yes! of that love Which has induced thy Maker From nothing to make all: And since in that debased Condition into which thy sorrows sunk thee, This love alone can draw thee, To the low world I took my flight from heaven. Perchance thou may'st suppose, enjoying love, That thou must therefore lead a savage life, A lover of the brutes; No, no, adorning all thy form with flowers, And wearing on thy locks a wreath of palm, Thou shalt enjoy a vest of gold and silver, Such as I wear, and such as high in heaven The radiant tissue shines, when sun and moon Weave their united rays. Thine eyes shall sparkle with resplendent fire, On thy warm cheek a graceful blush shall glow, And when in ecstasy thy lip is press'd, Its richer hue shall make the coral pale. Say at the very sound dost thou not feel Thy heart dissolve in amorous joy? I see Thou art delighted, Adam. Adam. I love, in truth I love, But only burn with love For my almighty Maker. THE FLESH. The soul alone can love, Can love this heavenly lord: But in these sublunary woodland scenes, Love has delights of a corporeal kind. Adam. The love thou speak'st of it is mine to prove With my beloved consort. THE FLESH. Yes! that is true; yet only sons of death Can spring from your affection. Adam. Sad fruit of my offence! THE FLESH. Ah, but immortal children From me shall spring, if thou wilt yield to me. Amidst these herbs and flowers Be our's sublimest love! Simple! extend thy hand, Behold, and touch my breast that thou wilt find Far different from the breast of mortal Eve. If thou wilt love, shall I not make thee worthy Of the unbounded joy To steal thee from thyself? Ah come, ah come, To this pure bosom that I show thee, Adam! Oh say to me, I love thee! Perchance thou may'st believe, Each man to spring from thee Ought to be happy with a single woman; Each woman too contented To love one man alone! Simple, if such thy thought: For all the sweets of love Become more poignant by the change of lovers. See how each animal, that dwells on earth, Leads a delicious life, By changing its affection; And thou, sole sovereign of each living creature, Shalt thou content thee with a single lover? Adam. Let sorrow's flame convert my heart to ashes, Rather than it may burn with double love! Hence then! depart! for a blind mole am I To all thy proffer'd beauty; And truly in thy presence I feel no touch of love. THE FLESH. O thou most icy heart! Now kindle with the flame of my affection. Behold this ample cavern of the earth; Lo, it was made for love; whate'er it holds Within its spacious circuit, Of love perceives the fire. Love rules the earth, the sea, the air, and fire, With endless love a hundred genial stars, Not moving from their sphere, Scatter their flames through heaven; And other wandering planets Through those exalted regions Direct their golden steps. What river, fount or stream, Unconscious flows and destitute of love? What frozen sea does love not penetrate With his imperious ardour? What glowing ocean does not oft discover A visage pale and wan, As if infirm with love? What flower, what plant, or stone, Wishes for love in vain, of love deprived? Whate'er inhabits heaven, or earth, or sea, Burns in the flame of love. Behold that sportive bird of painted wing, That goes with fluttering joy from bough to bough, And in his song declares he sings of love! Behold the sweet and oft repeated kisses Of those two doves, what dost thou think of them? Of love they are the kisses. The beauteous peacock see, That gaily fondles his attractive mate; He whirls the plume of love. Hear you that nightingale, does she not mourn? Now does she not exult? now 'tis her joy With her melodious warble To stun the vallies, and make glad the hills. Simple, what dost thou think? 'Tis love that makes her tuneful. Behold that river with its banks of flowers, Its stream of purest silver, And of fine gold its sand; Behold, dost thou not see within its bosom A thousand fishes glide? They lead the dance of love. Behold that sportive goat, that butting runs Exulting o'er the plain, His conflicts are from love. Look there, and see amidst a thousand folds Those close entwisted snakes, That in a single being seem combined: Coy Adam, even these Weave the close web of love. Behold, at length where yonder clustering vine Her amorous arms around the elm extends, She also burns with love. Even that flower, that ever courts the sun, Thus in its glances speaks, I dart the glance of love! And thou unmelting soul! wilt thou alone, Wilt thou disdain to feel That which all creatures prove? Nought can resist my golden pungent dart, Nor air, nor fire, nor sea, nor earth, nor heaven. SCENE THE SECOND. Lucifer, The Flesh, and Adam. Now burn with love, and bless the fond desire Of her, whom the Creator Made blazing all with love. Adam. And who art thou, whose thick and bushy locks And beard of silver shade thy head and face? Lucifer. Adam, I am a man; I am thy brother, But of a higher rank; Since I have drawn the vital air of heaven, Thou in this lower world; For well thou know'st, that station Affords an airy grandeur to our birth. In years too I surpass thee; My voice too, and my language Declare me old, as these my locks of silver; Now if all elder things Are deem'd superior to their successors, In this my merit must be more than thine. Adam. How I should answer thee, my tongue knows not, Thou lofty Lord of Heaven! Since my sad error with so thick a cloud Of ever-during fear O'ershades my eyes and heart. Lucifer. Oh, Adam, do not fear! THE FLESH. Wait thou a little! soon That shall be known to thee, which now is hid: All for thy good alone, And to save man from many griefs and pains. Lucifer. Now, Adam, understand. How having made me in his lofty heaven, He next created thee; For a new wish he form'd To make another man, and give the world To be his grateful residence, and then Clay he made flesh, and of that flesh made man: Then from the side of man he woman drew, And then ordain'd the law Prohibiting the apple, Which if he tasted, man Must be deprived of his celestial home. Hence is it thou hast felt, Hence is it thou hast seen Clouds rolling through the air, And fiery scintillations in the sky, Rebellowing thunder and its rattling bolts, And the tempestuous crash. These mournful pomps of horror, Say, say, what canst thou think That they portend below to new made man? All these appear'd in heaven, because from heaven Now the celestial Adam is dislodged. As to terrestial man, (As if the world would drive him from the world,) The earth itself grew barren, And every fruit grew harsh, The waters full of turbulence and gall, And every creature sharpened His beak, or tusk, or talon. Behold at last, O heaven! a pair of brothers, The citizens of earth. O, Adam, do not grieve, That I by fault of thine have now lost heaven, Since to have haply found Thee, my beloved brother, Now makes me not to feel the loss of heaven; And happy we will live In this, a sylvan, and a sunny scene. Or emulous of heaven, in God's own heaven Raised to a noble seat, I will, that we ascend, And underneath our feet Joy to behold the congregated choirs, Even like the blessed choirs, The children of this man. Now if we wish success to our desires, And should delight to see Springing like grass, and frequent as the flowers, Our children rapidly arise to light, Turn we our eyes and heart To this fair goddess of delightful love! For easy 'tis to her To form in sweet array the troops we wish. A plant so sweetly fruitful Is not; nor is the Earth herself so fertile; Nor does it raise so soon Its nutritive production, As she will raise, if we are so disposed, The fruit of lovely children. Then to the lily whiteness Of her enchanting cheek Advance the living roses of the lip! And of so sweet a flower For this love's goddess let us form a garland! Oh to the living ruby Of this sweet fount of kisses, If he for kisses thirst, The hart of love shall run, There bathe his thirsty lip, And there on kisses quench his mighty ardour. THE FLESH. Why this delay, O Adam? Approach, approach, my heart! Satiate thy thirst of love! Lucifer. What! dost thou fear, and tremble? Now let the empty cloud Of all thy vain suspicion Disperse before the sun of heavenly truth! Extend, extend thy arms And in one dear embrace encircle both! Happy who pants for thee! alas, what dost thou? At once thou givest, and again draw'st back Thy blandishments, like lightning, That in appearing flies and vanishes. Adam. What fear assaults my heart I cannot tell, But feel that like a timid deer I pant At the dire barking of blood-thirsty hounds. SCENE THE THIRD. Cherubim, Guardian of Adam, Adam, The Flesh, and Lucifer. Cherubim. 'Tis time to succour man: Alas! what dost thou, Most miserable Adam? Lucifer. Why dost thou silent stand? what are thy thoughts? Adam. I seem'd to hear a plaintive, pleasing voice, That in this manner spoke: Alas! what dost thou? Most miserable Adam! THE FLESH. A vain desire, and dread Now lords it o'er thy heart. Cherubim. Since thy heart trembles, evils must be nigh. Adam. I tremble at deceit. Lucifer. Thou must have lost thy reason, If thou canst fear thy mistress, and thy brother. Cherubim. Fear! for they are thy foes. Adam. Thou say'st thou art my brother, she my mistress; But if ye were my foes?— THE FLESH. Cruel to treat us so! What enemy can man now have on earth? Cherubim. The enemy of Eve. Adam. He, who occasion'd misery to Eve, And he, who was the cause, that from this brow The painful sweat must now descend in streams. Lucifer. So little wilt thou trust us? So lightly dost thou love us? Yet it is fit thy fault Call forth the tears to flow into thy bosom. THE FLESH. With treachery 'tis fit to treat with man In gesture, tears, and voice, Only to plunge him in Tartarean fires. Adam. They weep in such abundance, That every tear, they shed, strikes on my bosom; And though like marble hard, I fear, I fear, that if it does not split, It may at least be soften'd. Angel. These are the poisonous waters of Avernus, (Incautious man!) that from their eyes distill. Lucifer. Ah Heaven! why didst thou form me? Why didst thou join my lot With this ungrateful, misbelieving Adam, That feels not his own good, or my affliction? Adam. Restrain thy grief, thy tears! and suffer me, (If it is true, thy soul desires my good,) To speak to thee apart, And I to thee will open all my thoughts. Lucifer. Hast thou no other wish? Adam. No! I require no more. Lucifer. Behold us now apart! behold us far! If any other wish Strike thee, command! behold! we are obedient Not to thy words alone, but to thy nod. Adam. What wouldst thou, O my heart? What is thy wish, my soul? Now quiet thy desires! quiet thy pains! Cherubim. Tell him, if he's thy brother, And both descendants from the starry sphere, They should with thee, in pure and perfect zeal, Adore the Maker of the heaven and earth. Adam. That which my heart suggests, I now will do. THE FLESH. O tempter! now I fear Some singular mischance. Cherubim. Now, now the fraud is known. Adam. Now, brother, if you wish, With this your pure celestial paramour, Hail'd as the soul of love, That I should think the one an heavenly Adam, And her the only love of our great Maker, Now bend with me your humble knees to earth! Lucifer. How in one instant can two opposites, Humility and pride, Together reign in me? Adam. Can Adam so delay? Lucifer. I'll tell thee; ah, it seems a thing unfit That a celestial knee Should bend to this vile earth. Adam. Thou hast already told me, That in the high celestial plains above Thou must no longer dwell, But here with me enjoy delightful days, Amid these sunny spots; Let it not then displease thee With earthly habitudes To have thy breast, O Adam, fraught like mine! THE FLESH. Well dost thou speak, O Adam! I am ready To pay thee prompt obedience. Lucifer. And I will also show, This fair one's pleasure shall my pleasure be. Adam. Behold I bow myself! behold me bend! Now let united hands be raised to heaven. Lucifer. To make palm meet with palm, in vain we strive. Adam. In truth there seems much pain. Lucifer. Perhaps you wish Our hands united thus? Adam. No! what,—do you not see That both united form a knot together, Finger entwisting finger? THE FLESH. Perhaps you choose them thus? Adam. Alas! the example, That with my hands before your eyes I show you, Serves it so little? heavens! what do I see? So destitute of sense Are heavenly creatures? Lucifer. Now behold them join'd. THE FLESH. In truth I cannot tell, If Hell this day more tries the strength of Adam, Or Adam more torments the powers of Hell. Lucifer. Vigour, soul! animation! For in proportion as our strife is bloody, So will our palm of conquest rise in glory. Adam. Why do you thus apart In such confusion speak? Now raise your eyes to heaven, And with delight contemplate Of all those starry sapphires The pure resplendent rays, And those fair blessed seats! Alas, thou shutt'st thine eyes, That stream upon the ground. Lucifer. O Adam, cease at length! Those rays so splendid dazzle us too much. Adam. This is my foe: I now discern him well. The eagle of the sun Is used with pleasure on the sun to gaze; And thou, an heavenly eagle, Accustom'd to the brightest rays of heaven, Dost thou disdain, or shun them Dazzled, and in confusion? THE FLESH. Who knows what splendours in high heaven are kindled? He, who surveys them oft, Is satiated at last; There's nought created so divine and dear, That in long intercourse becomes not tiresome. Adam. Celestial good ne'er satiates, but delights, And magnifies itself in God's perfection; As the fair landscape's beauty (Though 'tis a low example) Becomes more perfect, and more flowery seems, When the sun gilds the vallies and the hills. But as I wish what ye too both desire, Now let your eyes be closed And with your opening lips pronounce these words: “Thee I adore.” Lucifer. Go on! Adam. Say then “Thee I adore.” Lucifer. Go on! for such a memory have I, That by a single effort I will repeat thy words. Adam. I am contented; Yet thou observe my words! Thee I adore, Thus with my knees to earth, and streaming eyes, Lord of the empyrean! Great sovereign of the heavens, and only God! Holy, firm, formidable, just, and pious! And still dost thou delay? Lucifer. I meditate thy speech, Which to me seems so long, I doubt my power to speak it. Adam. Shall I again pronounce it? Lucifer. This I cannot desire, But find a great defect In this imploring speech. Adam. Pray tell me what? Lucifer. No humble worshipper, not the adorer, But the adored, 'tis just that I should be. Alas! I can no longer Such outrages endure: No! who I am, I must at length reveal. THE FLESH. Alas! the same thing even I must do. Adam. Alas! what do I see? What horrid form, amidst the clustering trees, Does this false denizen of heaven assume? And his immodest partner? Alas! their winged feet The false ones move to me, And from their pomp and gold, Breathe forth infuriate flame! Succour me! help, O God! Take pity on my failing! Lucifer. Fly, as thou canst, from these my rapid wings Thy flying must be vain. Alas! to my great grief, this day I see Who has the prize of conquest, Who soonest yields, and from his rival flies. So that I well can say To the eternal gulf, That in this hard and perilous contention, The toil belongs to Hell; to man the glory. I lose, alas! I lose: now with what face Can this my foot be turn'd again to hell? THE FLESH. Ah! sad and dire event! ah strife! ah death! Lucifer. Yes, yes, 'tis just, that my infernal rage Should all now turn on me, Since I have vainly tried To work the condemnation of this man. But can this be? (ah! hard is my belief,) Exalted providence! Cherubim. Thou canst not mount, fierce monster! I affirm it, By this high brandish'd dart of penal fire. Lucifer. Ah, for the seats of hell I spread my rapid wings. Cherubim. And I these happier wings lucid and light, Will exercise around For man's protection, and in scorn of hell. SCENE THE FOURTH. THE WORLD. How fine I now appear! no more I seem A monster now of horror, But of a lofty spot The blissful habitant, and call'd The World; That so adorn'd and splendid, Amidst thy prime delights, Laughter, and songs, and amorous affections, My snares of silver, and my nets of gold I may extend for man, That he may slide and fall, to rise no more; And try in vain to heaven Again to rise upon the wings of zeal. And should he seem for ever Bent to survey the lovely azure heaven, The sun's bright lustre, and the lunar ray, And trembling stellar fires, I will delude him so With other lovely skies, that from the first Quick he shall turn his view. I will, that my fair heaven Shall be of living sapphire; there shall shine A sun of bright pyropus, and a moon Form'd of the beamy diamond's spotless light. A thousand and a thousand sparkling stars, Of jewels rich and rare; And if amidst this lightning it may thunder, And burning bolts may seem to dart around, My lightning be the ruby, My thunder sounding silver, With thunderbolts of gold, and storms of pearl! As a proud sovereign of so rich a heaven, The World shall still exult, And this new man shall bend to me in worship; And thus of these my pomps, My luxuries, and joys, The numerous sons of man, become enamour'd, Shall never know repose; But with destructive force Each shall endeavour of his wretched brother To gain the envied finery and wealth. Man I behold already for this gold, And for the world's delights, In horrid mansion full of smoke and fire, Tempering the deadly steel; Now at the anvil, see! How striking frequent with his iron mace, He forms the coat of mail; makes it his vest, And for destruction draws the blade of steel. Another, see! converting Cold iron into fire, Tapers, and twists it round; And now an hatchet forms; now see him eager To level trees and woods, And now, with numerous planks, Behold him raise a work Fit to sustain the fury of the sea. Others I see toiling to pass o'er alps, To pass o'er mountains, and the riven rock: Leeches that prey on ore, And from earth's bosom suck great veins of gold. Lo! others in the deep Trying the fertile sea, plunge through the waves, Fearless encountering its tempestuous pride, If they from crusted shell, or craggy rock May coral draw, or pearl. Ah, labour as thou wilt, and sigh, or sweat In this pursuit of gold, Thy cares and woes shall gather in proportion To all thy gather'd wealth. Lo! to preserve thy jewels and thy wealth, Thou hidest them under earth, And gold forbids thee to enjoy thy gold. Hence treacherous we see The servant to his lord, And through his breast and heart He thrusts the faithless sword, Through eagerness of gold. Hence on the table of a royal house There stands the statue of an unicorn, As if in scorn of man; Since, giving safety to a mighty lord, The beast exposes human cruelty. Hence is it that the son, Greedy of gold, becomes his father's foe, Wishes him short existence, Flies him, and steals his wealth, So that to make him glad, his sire may pine. Hence is it, that for gold, Brothers, becoming frantic, Brandish the hostile steel, And deem this gold more precious than their blood. Here by the blaze of gold The eyes of woman dazzled See not her husband, nor regard her children, While, on the wings of passion, She with the adulterer flies, nor yet perceives That for this gold (vile dust!) She has resolved to quit her very flesh. What more? what more? not only By gold's possession thou shalt prove the foe Of wife, of father, brother, and of friend, But rebel even to God; Since with intemperate zeal Mere idols form'd of gold, Thou shalt proclaim the only powers of heaven. But what do I behold? blest that I am! I see fair Eve approach! on her soft back Bearing a load of many leafy boughs: What she now means to do Here will I watch, conceal'd amidst this bower. SCENE THE FIFTH. Eve and The World. Eve. Canst thou presume, afflicted, wretched Eve, To the bright sun to raise again thine eyes? No! no! thou art unworthy well thou seest: Thou couldst behold him once, And gaze delighted on his golden splendour; Now if thou darest to view him, His radiance dazzles thee; rather thou seem'st, When thou hast dared to meet his potent beams, To have thy fading eyes Wrapt in a dusky veil. Alas! it is too true, That I in darkness dwell, And in the formidable clouds of sin I have o'erwhelm'd the light of innocence. Ah wretched, mournful Eve! If now thou turn'st thy foot, Eager to taste the pure and limpid stream, Alas, how troubled dost thou find the water, Or else the fountain dry! If with quick appetite thou chance to turn, Anxious from lovely plants to pluck the fruit, How dost thou find it crude, Or made the dark recess of filthy worms! If weary, 'midst the flowers Thou seek'st to close thine eyes, Behold! with fluttering pinions at thy feet, A serpent 'midst the flowers darts and hisses. Now to avoid the heat Of the fierce sun if thou wouldst seek the shade Of the thick wood, or of the leafy grove, Thou fear'st the rage of monsters, and must tremble Like the light leaf that shakes at every breeze. And hence it is thy wish To fasten bough to bough, and trunk to trunk, Raising some safe asylum From serpents, monsters, tempests, and the sun. To you then will I turn me, verdant boughs, That hither on my back with toil I bore, Do you defend me now! now rise you here, Afford a safe retreat To Eve so wretched! Lo! I thus begin. It will suffice, if I with tender hand Just shadow, what with far superior strength And more enlighten'd sense, The sinner, Adam, here may terminate. THE WORLD. Abode more firm and faithful, Hell now prepares for thee, or rather Death. Behold, behold, how she Employs herself in placing these green boughs! To Eve I will unveil me:—Ah! what dost thou? Why art thou raising thus, Eve, gentle fair one, these thy leafy boughs? Tell me, what wouldst thou do, Why dost thou toil and sigh? Eve. Alas! what do I see? Do not approach me! no! from me be far! THE WORLD. What canst thou fear, O lovely, Sweet angel of the earth? Joy of all hearts, and honour of the world? Eve. Thou Lord, who didst create me, This stranger, who now rich in gold and gems Courteous accosts me with a human face, Do thou to me reveal; Nor let our God consent, That Eve again, or man, Precipitately fall in fatal error! Alas! with human face An artful base deceiver Led me to taste the interdicted apple; And thence my heart must dread Other infernal guile, Since in the world one man alone exists. THE WORLD. Before my light, as at the radiant sun Darkness itself is used to disappear, Drive from thy heart this cloud, That makes thy visage pale; And from the lovely cave of glowing rubies, Now closed to guard, as in the depth of Ganges, The treasure of inestimable pearls, Send forth thy tender sighs; And if, thou fair one, 'tis thy wish to sigh, Let all thy sighs be sweet! Eve. And who art thou, so eager To change the tears of woman into smiles? THE WORLD. Know, gentle fair one, you in me behold As much as you can see, Raising your eyes to heaven, Or turning them to earth; An indigested mass, Chaos I once was call'd, now fair and fine, Heaven, earth, and sea salute me as The World. I too have had my residence amidst The miracles above; But O! a fault of mine, Which now to tell thee would be out of season, Induced the sacred Resident above From his eternal dome in wrath to drive me; And from a bright and fine Trophy of Paradise, Into a shapeless mass Of hideous matter he converted me. At last my mighty Maker, having seen That my condition balanced my offence, Bestow'd upon me soon another form, Far from his highest heaven, and thus at once Annihilated that tremendous prison, Dreary and dark; he made me in exchange The luminous gay World. Eve. Alas! my first alarm So deeply wounds, and lords it o'er my heart, I know not what to credit, what to do. THE WORLD. Now, since there's nothing that to me affords Such infinite disgust, As to behold aught dirty and neglected, I pray thee, lovely fair, be it thy study With purple, gold, and robes adorn'd with pearl, To grace thy gentle form, and cast to earth Those skins of animals that shock the sight. Observe how much more pleasing and majestic Man may be render'd by a graceful dress! Compared to me, dost thou not seem a beast? Rather among the beasts Dost thou not seem the vilest animal? Dost thou not see, that every abject creature, Or of the foaming sea, Or of the fields of air, Or of the woods and mountains, Are deck'd with humid scales, Gay feathers, shaggy skins, or painted bristles? And if on earth thou wert created naked, Yet well array'd with reason Appear'd thy noble soul, by which thou might'st (Made empress of the world) Deck thee with radiant gems, and robes of gold. Too vile a mansion are the woods for thee, In nakedness surpassing even the beasts. For what end dost thou think, The great exalted hand Created in a moment Gold, silver, and rich gems? Perchance, perchance thou think'st It may be right, that these Bright wonders of the world Rest ever buried in a blind oblivion. No! no! thou simpleton, it is that man, Sweating in their pursuit, May decorate himself; and as the sun Flames in full splendour in a sapphire sky, Or 'mid the stars of gold The bright and silvery moon, He thus may glitter in this earthly heaven. What more! behold what gems the sea conceals, Or the rich earth embraces, Which, tempting man to joy, Display their rare endowments; Whence it is just to say, They were for man created; and if blind Through ignorance he slights them, Or shows himself ungrateful, Why has such treasure been for man created? Shall it be true, that you, the sovereign fair, The gentle ruler of this worldly realm, Can prove to God ungrateful? to the World Like earth's vile offspring? Rise! assume this gold, The topaz, ruby, pearls, and splendid purple, Bright robes of gold, and rich habiliments! In worldly trophies like our lofty queen Shine, Eve, and let all creatures worship thee! O how in viewing thee, thou radiant fair, Cover'd with gems and gold, I seem to joy! O how, While you majestically move along, The flowers appear before your feet to weave A sweet impediment! Rather I seem to see the stars from heaven Innumerous descend, Here for your feet to form a bright support. What dost thou, pensive fair? Now of thy radiant locks, that stream at length, A string of jewels, of fine threads you weave, For hearts a net of gold. Now let a charming smile Enliven thy sweet cheek! Then shalt thou hear in accents of delight The birds around miraculously say, “O what a lip of coral! And what fair teeth of pearl, Has Eve's sweet mouth, so delicately small! How sweet is her discourse, That seems to be below, what, in high heaven, The voice of God is to the blessed host.” Arise, arise! be warm, Thou spring of tenderness, and flame of souls! Come! leave! O leave the woods To creatures of the forest; And with resplendent brass, And snowy shining marble, Let a proud palace now be raised to heaven, To form a worthy mansion for thy merit! To make this easy to thee The World will find not difficult. That wood, Which you have wish'd to join, Fearing the fury of the savage beasts, Let that now form a seat With walls of silver, and a roof of gold, Of emerald its pillars, And hung on golden hinges, gates of pearl! Eve. Oh heaven! what do I see? what's this, O God? THE WORLD. What hast thou more to say? Ah, simple, enter With light and speedy foot, there, where alone Thou find'st a fit abode! Then wilt thou truly be of thy great Maker, The image and ingenious imitator, Since he among so many Legions in heaven, as much as he excels them In majesty, so much himself he raised On his exalted throne, in highest heaven. Thus here below let man amid these tribes Of fishes and of birds, And of unnumber'd beasts, Possess a mansion worthy Both of his name and empire! Eve. In truth when I behold your mighty pomps, That might so soon be counted as my own, I will not say that my high heart feels not The goading of ambition; but in turning My eyes upon the precept of my Father, I will disdain, and from your proffers fly, As from vile dirt the snowy ermine flies. And this poor skin alone Shall be my golden robe adorn'd with pearl; A cave my proud abode; The troubled water and rude herbs to me, Dear beverage and food. No! no! I will not to my first dread fault Now add a second like it; making thus A path more recent to the gulf of ruin: THE WORLD. O simple fair, come forth! Come forth, ye fair and gentle virgins all, From this my golden palace! Be you devoted handmaids Around this fair, and 'midst your tuneful songs Present to her rich robes, adorn'd with gold! SCENE THE SIXTH. Chorus of Nymphs, Eve, The World, and Adam. Behold in dance, O joyful World, Little virgins; See these maidens, With their treasure bright and cheerful; Hearken now how they are singing; Eve alone invoke, and honour! See their robes with gold inwoven; See their vestments Shedding lustre From the treasure of their jewels! Bright the crown, and rich the sceptre, That to Eve is now presented. If in heaven, nor sun nor planet Shed its ardour And its radiance, Heaven would be a mass of horror; But with light so pure and radiant Heaven is term'd the seat of splendour. He, who made so many wonders, Fair and beauteous, Is desirous All that's fair to have before him: Deck thyself then, O thou coy one, If thy God delights in beauty. Adam. What dost thou, Eve, not see That if uncautious to these charms thou yieldest, We shall sink deeper in the snares of hell? Eve. Alas! what do I hear? Adam. Hence, ye rebellious crew! By virtue of my God depart confounded, To the infernal realms! Chorus. Ah, thou must then avoid this light of day, Thou sightless mole of hell! THE WORLD. Ah flesh infected! Await, O yet await Fit punishment to your presumptuous rage! And hast thou dared so highly, Thou creature of corruption, That this bright palace which for Eve I raised, Speaking thou hast ingulf'd, And from the day hast banish'd A numerous group of fair and graceful nymphs. Come forth, now all come forth, Ye horrid monsters, from the caves of hell! Let us this hour display Our utmost fortitude, and force supreme. Now let this man be chain'd; Fix him a prisoner in the depths of hell, And let his victor reap the glory due. Eve. Succour, O God! O succour! Lord shew thy mercy to my great offence! Adam. Ah do not fear, my love, But hope, still hope in Heaven; hope, for at last Celestial grace was never slow to save. SCENE THE SEVENTH. Lucifer, Death, The World, and Chorus of Demons, armed with various Arms. Lucifer. Thou fool, in vain thou toil'st To invocate high heaven; thy God may arm, If he is not abased, and with him arm His flying warriors all, From our infernal chains And these sharp talons, now to draw thee forth; To his first loss, and first discomfiture, A second like the first shall soon be join'd. Of his supernal loss has he not heal'd The painful memory, The ruin of his Angels? That now, inflamed with anger, He seeks in heaven another mightier ruin? To arms! at length to arms, Satanic warriors all! And let his wretched residue of Angels, All falling out of heaven, Be all ingulfed in hell! Lo meteors in the air and storms at sea I kindle and I raise: Lo Tartarus his wings Spreads for celestial seats: Behold the stars of God By Lucifer's proud foot crush'd and extinguish'd; And girt for war and glory, Let Tartarus through heaven proclaim a triumph! SCENE THE EIGHTH. Archangel Michael, Chorus of Angels, Chorus of Demons. Michael. Tremble, thou son of wrath, At this sharp dart's inevitable glance, At the dread stroke of the celestial leader; Not against God, against thyself alone, Thou raisest wrath, and wounding wound'st thyself. Sink into shade, misguided, wretched spirit! Utterly void of all angelic light, Be blind in gazing on that heavenly lustre To me imparted by the Lord of light, The dazzler of the sun. Fly, ye infected crew, Ye enemies of God, Nor let the breathing whirlwind, With blast from hell, the yet unruin'd life Of man o'erwhelm with deeper shades of darkness. No more thy fatal hiss, thou snake of hell, Shall by its discord stun; Since pierced and panting now Thou faintest, poison'd by thy own contagion. Lucifer. Heaven's talking minister, With rays more loaded than inspired with courage; Soft creature of the sky, Thou angel of repose, In solemn indolence, Humility's calm nest, a seat of peace, A warrior but in name, Whose countenance is fear, whose heart confusion; Spread, spread thy pinions for the arms of God, Take refuge there, and there be confident! For too unequal would the combat be 'Twixt cowardice and valour, The warrior and the slave, Infirmity and strength, and, let me say, Betwixt vile Michael and brave Lucifer. But if such daring can inflame thy heart, As now to rescue from this warlike arm That man, mere flesh and clay, That animated dust, I warn thee well Of mortal conflict sharp, where thou shalt see, By this avenging hand All the large family of God extinguish'd. Michael. Such mournful victory, O Belial, in thy frenzy desperate, As once in heaven thou gain'st, now with mankind Subduing the deceived, And hence the conquer'd conquers, Freed is the captive, and thyself ensnared. Now be it manifest What palms of victory 'tis thine to raise. Behold against thee, thou unfaithful spirit, Michael become compassionately cruel. Lucifer. If at the early sound of war, the first Encounter of our arms, 'Twas given a mighty warrior to destroy A third part of the stars, See in what brief assault I can demolish the great seat of God! Be dazzled now before this warlike blaze, That from the brow of death I now diffuse, Whirling in bloody circle From my high front these death-denouncing comets! Behold, behold at length Heaven yields no more a refuge to its angels! Since to a fate more joyous A happy pass expands, and seems to say Begone, at length begone, Ye frighten'd angels, now relinquish heaven! The warrior doom'd to hell Becomes the blessed lord of these bright seats. Michael. Why longer pause to crush the proud loquacity Of this presumptuous and insulting rebel? Soon with a pen of adamant, with striking Dread characters of blood, Within the volume of eternal woe The glory shall be blazon'd Of thy lost victory. To arms! at length to arms, To spread dismay through hell! Joy, Man! smile, Heaven; and Tartarus, lament! Lucifer. Seldom upon the vaunting Of a proud tongue too bold Boldness of hand attends. To arms! to arms! Thou fight with me; and you, my followers, all Unconquerable warriors, Transperse and put to flight this abject crew, The timid partisans Of an unwarlike leader! Ah! him who favours brief and endless shame Possess'd in heaven, and now on earth display'd Great fortitude but with unequal force, Him a celestial stroke Now drives confounded to the blind abyss; And justice here decrees, That he who lost the fight should lose the sun. Angels and God, at length ye are triumphant! Now, now is Lucifer O'erwhelm'd, and all his legion Sinks from the light of day to endless night. Michael. Fall thou at length, fall wounded and subdued, Fierce monster of the shades, To death's deep horrors, there be doom'd to die By an immortal death! Nor hope thy wings to heaven Ever to spread again, that wish, too bold For thee, so desperate and unrepenting. Thou'rt fallen, at length thou'rt fallen, Most arrogant of monsters, In pain thou sink'st as low, As high in joy it was thy hope to soar. Again thou learn'st to fall, Transfixt with thunder, to the drear abyss. Fool! thou hast wish'd to take this man thy captive, And thou alone hast plunged Within the deepest gulf: Hence, pierced and overwhelm'd, Sinking to Tartarus, The flame of wrath eternal Bore thee to hell, the hell of hottest fires. A spotless angel, O thou prince of falsehood, Thy folly hoped to put to flight and wound; But thou, opposed to him Hast yielded, plying thy winged feet in haste. Thou too hast hoped to turn the spacious world, In hostile flame, to ashes, And at thy ardent blast and baleful breathing Clouds, lightning, and tempestuous bursts of thunder, With rattling deadly bolts of arrowy flame, Roll'd through the air, whence all the mountains shook, And all the vales re-echoed in convulsion. And yet, behold, in heaven The spheres move round more musical than ever, And all the azure sky The lucid sun with brighter beam adorns; Behold the ocean, tremulously placid, And from his Persian gulf In gay abundance scattering pearl and coral; Nor weary are the sportive fish in gliding Along the trembling sapphire. Behold, what verdant and what flowery brows These pleasant vales in exultation raise; Hark, to the grateful accents Of every flying songster, Inhabitant of air, That in his flight now gives Voice to the woods and music to the vales. Now, all rejoicing in a day so noble, To the confusion and the shame of hell, Let every spotless ensign rise to heaven, And fluttering sport with the exulting winds; Let all the instruments of heavenly glory Sound through the sky the victories of heaven! SCENE THE NINTH. Adam, Eve, Chorus of Angels. O sounds beloved, that call us now in joy, To scenes we left in sorrow; ah! I fear To taint the fragrance of the heavenly host, Stain'd as I am with sin. O thou, that haply of celestial ruby Wearest the blazing mail, Hallow'd and brave Archangel, Brave, yet compassionate, thy golden locks Radiant as light, thy glittering helmet covers; Thou in thy right hand shakest the spear of victory, And raisest in thy left a golden balance; Close, close thy painted plumes so rich in gold, And cast a gentle look On him who, prostrate, honours and adores thee. Eve. O happy dawn of the eternal sun, Thou courteous kind restorer, To these my blinded eyes With sorrow darken'd, and bedew'd with tears; Now, of thy rays a fixt contemplator, The mole of error stands; Now on your voice depends An asp, once deaf to heaven's most friendly dictates. I, wavering wanderer, Who undissembling own The fault in which I fell, to thee I bend, Nor in my speech deny That I am Eve, the cause Of human-kind's perdition. Now let thy guardian hand (O in the deeds of God thou faithful servant!) Relieve me from the depth Of my so great offences. Adam. Of heavenly mysteries And secret will of God, Thou hallow'd blest revealer, Angel of eloquence! The fatal presages Of mournful Eve and Adam Now quiet with the breath Of thy exalted converse; So that this troubled flood That strikes the heart, in issuing from the eyes, No more may make me seem A rock of sorrow in a sea of tears. Michael. Arise, O both arise, you who of God Are creatures so regarded, Dismiss your fears of the infernal portent. If your eternal Lord Corrects you with one hand, He with the other proffers your protection. With happy auspices, He who delivers souls, On his light wings directs his flight to you, In God's dread warfare harbinger of peace. The mighty Fount of life, The Artificer of souls, The Architect of worlds, The mighty Lord of heaven, Maker of angels and of all things made, The infinite Creator, To safety summons you, And to short war a lasting peace ordains. Now from those double fountains The warm and gushing streams Of sorrow, Eve, restrain! Thou hast been culpable In rashly seizing the forbidden fruit; To man thou hast occasion'd Anguish and grief; thou hast indeed converted Peace into war, and life into perdition: Now by the aid of Him, Whose handmaid nature is, and servant fate, Who can restrain the sun, And motion give to this unmoving mass, Even yet may Eve enjoy In prison, liberty; May be unbound, though fetter'd, And triumph, while she is o'ercome, and vanquish. Now, since there shines in heaven The star of love and peace, And to the shame of hell, The victor to the vanquish'd yields his palm, Ah now let each, with humble eyes to heaven, Incline the knee to earth, And supplicant in prayer, give God the praise Of goodness infinite; For you shall find, to recompense your zeal, That God your father is, your mansion heaven; Adam. Thou mighty Lord, who resting high above, With regulated errors And with discordant union guidest heaven; O of the fair eternal realms of light Thou Lord immutable, resplendent power, Thou dazzler and obscurer of the sun! Now in these weeping eyes And on this humid cheek I dry my bitter tears, I cheer my heart. Now, by thy zealous mercy, Though spotted, I have safety; Security in hazard, love in hate, And sinking into hell, Am yet a citizen of highest heaven. Eve. With dissolution life, With strife and contest peace, With ruin victory, With deep offence salvation, With powers of darkness heaven, These to unite is not a human talent, But of the eternal hand, Omnipotence supreme; hence is it, Lord, That wounded Eve is whole, Triumphs in loss, and, though subdued, has glory. My guide, I will obey thee; Since, O benignant Lord, Thy service is dominion, And to obey thee, glory. If pain allow not that I speak the pain Which wounds my heart so deeply, Thou most indulgent Father Givest to the heart and soul a new existence: Awaken'd by affliction, Raising my voice to heaven, I'll teach resounding echo To carry to the sky my humble song, Devoted to thy praise. Michael. Ye victims cleansed by tears, Ye martyrs in affliction, Amidst your blessed pains, Ye holocausts of life and of content! Now call the stars no more Vindictive; war is now Converted into peace, And death turn'd into life. Hence mortal Adam is now made immortal, And Eve, though dead in many parts, revives. The potent fire of love, In which the tender God of mercy blazes, Inflames him with pure zeal to save the sinner. Contend, resist, and bravely Wage with the hostile Serpent constant war; It is man's province now To conquer Hell, and triumph over Death. Creatures of grace! feel deeply now for ever, That your most gracious Father Would not direct towards the ground your face, As he has made the brute, but up to heaven; So that, for ever mindful of their source, Your happy souls may point towards their home: For the high realm of heaven Is as a shining glass, in which of God The glories ever blaze. Inure yourselves to water, sun, and winds, And in the stony caves, In the most barren desert That the sun visits when he blazes most, There both exert your powers; There many years and many, United ye shall dwell in hallow'd love; And from your progeny henceforth the world Exulting shall derive fertility. And now to you, ye mortal pair, I promise, As ye together sinn'd, If ye in penitence have join'd together, Together e'en in Heaven, In a corporeal veil Contemplating the sacred face of God, Ye shall enjoy the bliss of Paradise. Adam. Greater than my offence I now acknowledge Your mercy, O my God! Since you, become the sovereign friend of man, To him, though ruin'd, now extend your hand! Eve. As I have known to sin, So shall I know to weep; For who in sinning knew forbidden joy, Humble in punishment, should know to suffer. Be mute, be mute, my tongue, Speak thou within, my heart, And say with words of love, See how to mortals, even in perdition, The hand of heavenly succour was extended! Michael. At length, since now with joy Man, being thus deliver'd From hell's keen talon, feels unbounded transport, And in his rapture deems Earth turn'd to heaven, this world a paradise; By these pure splendid dazzling rays of heaven, By these delightful fires, That in the light of God more lovely blaze, Rich with new beams, and with new suns this day, Day of festivity, The day of paradise, rather a day Blest in itself, and blessing every other! Let all with festive joy Of God's indulgence sing; Of Adam and of Eve, Now made on earth the denizens of heaven; And let your tuneful songs Become the wonder of futurity. ANGELS SING. Move, let us move our feet There, where this man shall now Wash out his past offence With humble, hallow'd drops; And of the mighty Maker Praise we the love and mercy, That in this day to man's envenom'd wound Suddenly gives his pity's healing aid; Rejects him and receives, Deeming his every wrong and error light; And now at last with more benignant zeal, And in despite of Satan, Gives him, redeem'd from Hell, A seat amid the golden stars of Heaven. Ye progeny of Adam, Whose race we shall behold adorn the world, Ye shall not pray in vain To your high Lord, the fountain of all mercy. Be leaves of that pure branch, On which the Word Incarnate shall be grafted! Thunder, infuriate Hell, Be stormy! yet his leaf shall never fall: To him a joyous offspring Is promised by the Lord of heaven's great vineyard, Stricken, transfixt, enkindled in a blaze, And burning with eternal love for man.

June 4, 1791. THE ILIAD OF HOMER TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH BLANK VERSE. BOOK I. ARGUMENT OF THE FIRST BOOK. The book opens with an account of a pestilence that prevailed in the Greecian camp, and the cause of it is assigned. A council is called, in which fierce altercation takes place between Agamemnon and Achilles. The latter solemnly renounces the field. Agamemnon by his heralds demands Brisëis, and Achilles resigns her. He makes his complaint to Thetis, who undertakes to plead his cause with Jupiter. She pleads it, and prevails. The book concludes with an account of what passed in Heaven on that occasion. The English reader will be pleased to observe, that by Achaians, Argives, Danaï, are signified Greecians. Homer himself having found these various appellatives both graceful and convenient, it seemed unreasonable that a Translator of him should be denied the same advantage. Achilles sing, O Goddess! Peleus' son; His wrath pernicious, who ten thousand woes Caused to Achaia's host, sent many a soul Illustrious into Ades premature, And Heroes gave (so stood the will of Jove) To dogs and to all ravening fowls a prey, When fierce dispute had separated once The noble Chief Achilles from the son Of Atreus, Agamemnon, King of men. Who them to strife impell'd? What power divine? Latona's son and Jove's. For He, incensed Against the King, a foul contagion raised In all the host, and multitudes destroy'd, For that the son of Atreus had his priest Dishonoured, Chryses. To the fleet he came Bearing rich ransom glorious to redeem His daughter, and his hands charged with the wreath And golden sceptre of the God shaft-arm'd. His supplication was at large to all The host of Greece, but most of all to two, The sons of Atreus, highest in command. Ye gallant Chiefs, and ye their gallant host, (So may the Gods who in Olympus dwell Give Priam's treasures to you for a spoil And ye return in safety,) take my gifts And loose my child, in honour of the son Of Jove, Apollo, archer of the skies. At once the voice of all was to respect The priest, and to accept the bounteous price; But so it pleased not Atreus' mighty son, Who with rude threatenings stern him thence dismiss'd. Beware, old man! that at these hollow barks I find thee not now lingering, or henceforth Returning, lest the garland of thy God And his bright sceptre should avail thee nought. I will not loose thy daughter, till old age Steal on her. From her native country far, In Argos, in my palace, she shall ply The loom, and shall be partner of my bed. Move me no more. Be gone; hence while thou may'st. He spake, the old priest trembled and obey'd. Forlorn he roamed the ocean's sounding shore, And, solitary, with much prayer his King Bright-hair'd Latona's son, Phœbus, implored. God of the silver bow, who with thy power Encirclest Chrysa, and who reign'st supreme In Tenedos and Cilla the divine, Sminthian So called on account of his having saved the people of Troas from a plague of mice, sminthos in their language meaning a mouse. Apollo! If I e'er adorned Thy beauteous fane, or on thy altar burn'd The fat acceptable of bulls or goats, Grant my petition. With thy shafts avenge On the Achaian host thy servant's tears. Such prayer he made, and it was heard. The God, Down from Olympus with his radiant bow And his full quiver o'er his shoulder slung, Marched in his anger; shaken as he moved His rattling arrows told of his approach. Gloomy he came as night; sat from the ships Apart, and sent an arrow. Clang'd the cord For this singular line the Translator begs to apologize, by pleading the strong desire he felt to produce an English line, if possible, somewhat resembling in its effect the famous original one. ????? ?? ?????? ?????? ????????? ?????.Dread-sounding, bounding on the silver bow. Mules first and dogs he struck, but at themselves Dispatching soon his bitter arrows keen, Smote them. Death-piles on all sides always blazed. Nine days throughout the camp his arrows flew; The tenth, Achilles from all parts convened The host in council. Juno the white-armed, Moved at the sight of Greecians all around Dying, imparted to his mind the thought. The full assembly, therefore, now convened, Uprose Achilles ardent, and began. Atrides! Now, it seems, no course remains For us, but that the seas roaming again, We hence return; at least if we survive; But haste, consult we quick some prophet here Or priest, or even interpreter of dreams, (For dreams are also of Jove,) that we may learn By what crime we have thus incensed Apollo, What broken vow, what hecatomb unpaid He charges on us, and if soothed with steam Of lambs or goats unblemish'd, he may yet Be won to spare us, and avert the plague. He spake and sat, when Thestor's son arose Calchas, an augur foremost in his art, Who all things, present, past, and future knew, And whom his skill in prophecy, a gift Conferr'd by Phœbus on him, had advanced To be conductor of the fleet to Troy; He, prudent, them admonishing, replied. Jove-loved Achilles! Would'st thou learn from me What cause hath moved Apollo to this wrath, The shaft-arm'd King? I shall divulge the cause. But thou, swear first and covenant on thy part That speaking, acting, thou wilt stand prepared To give me succour; for I judge amiss, Or he who rules the Argives, the supreme O'er all Achaia's host, will be incensed. Woe to the man who shall provoke the King! For if, to-day, he smother close his wrath, He harbours still the vengeance, and in time Performs it. Answer, therefore, wilt thou save me? To whom Achilles, swiftest of the swift. What thou hast learn'd in secret from the God, That speak, and boldly. By the son of Jove, Apollo, whom thou, Calchas, seek'st in prayer Made for the Danaï, and who thy soul Fills with futurity, in all the host The Greecian lives not, who while I shall breathe, And see the light of day, shall in this camp Oppress thee; no, not even if thou name Him, Agamemnon, sovereign o'er us all. Then was the seer embolden'd, and he spake. Nor vow nor hecatomb unpaid on us He charges, but the wrong done to his priest Whom Agamemnon slighted when he sought His daughter's freedom, and his gifts refused. He is the cause. Apollo for his sake Afflicts and will afflict us, neither end Nor intermission of his heavy scourge Granting, 'till unredeem'd, no price required, The black-eyed maid be to her father sent, And a whole hecatomb in Chrysa bleed. Then, not before, the God may be appeased. He spake and sat; when Atreus' son arose, The Hero Agamemnon, throned supreme. Tempests of black resentment overcharged His heart, and indignation fired his eyes. On Calchas louring, him he first address'd. Prophet of mischief! from whose tongue no note Of grateful sound to me, was ever heard; Ill tidings are thy joy, and tidings glad Thou tell'st not, or thy words come not to pass. And now among the Danaï thy dreams Divulging, thou pretend'st the Archer-God For his priest's sake, our enemy, because I scorn'd his offer'd ransom of the maid Chrysëis, more desirous far to bear Her to my home, for that she charms me more Than Clytemnestra, my own first espoused, With whom, in disposition, feature, form, Accomplishments, she may be well compared. Yet, being such, I will return her hence If that she go be best. Perish myself,— But let the people of my charge be saved! Prepare ye, therefore, a reward for me, And seek it instant. It were much unmeet That I alone of all the Argive host Should want due recompense, whose former prize Is elsewhere destined, as ye all perceive. To whom Achilles, matchless in the race. Atrides, glorious above all in rank, And as intent on gain as thou art great, Whence shall the Greecians give a prize to thee? The general stock is poor; the spoil of towns Which we have taken, hath already passed In distribution, and it were unjust To gather it from all the Greeks again. But send thou back this Virgin to her God, And when Jove's favour shall have given us Troy, A threefold, fourfold share shall then be thine. To whom the Sovereign of the host replied. Godlike Achilles, valiant as thou art, Would'st thou be subtle too? But me no fraud Shall overreach, or art persuade, of thine. Would'st thou, that thou be recompensed, and I Sit meekly down defrauded of my due? And did'st thou bid me yield her? Let the bold Achaians give me competent amends, Such as may please me, and it shall be well. Else, if they give me none, I will command Thy prize, the prize of Ajax, or the prize It may be of Ulysses to my tent, And let the loser chafe. But this concern Shall be adjusted at convenient time. Come,—Launch we now into the sacred deep A bark with lusty rowers well supplied; Then put on board Chrysëis, and with her The sacrifice required. Go also one High in authority, some counsellor, Idomeneus, or Ajax, or thyself, Thou most untractable of all mankind; And seek by rites of sacrifice and prayer To appease Apollo on our host's behalf. Achilles eyed him with a frown, and spake. Ah! cloathed with impudence as with a cloak, And full of subtlety, who, thinkest thou— What Greecian here will serve thee, or for thee Wage covert war, or open? Me thou know'st, Troy never wronged; I came not to avenge Harm done to me; no Trojan ever drove My pastures, steeds or oxen took of mine, Or plunder'd of their fruits the golden fields Of Phthia the deep-soil'd. She lies remote, And obstacles are numerous interposed, Vale-darkening mountains, and the dashing sea. No, ??????. Shameless Wolf! For thy good pleasure sake We came, and, ??????????. Face of flint! to avenge the wrongs By Menelaus and thyself sustain'd, On the offending Trojan—service kind, But lost on thee, regardless of it all. And now—What now? Thy threatening is to seize Thyself, the just requital of my toils, My prize hard-earn'd, by common suffrage mine. I never gain, what Trojan town soe'er We ransack, half thy booty. The swift march And furious onset,—these I largely reap, But, distribution made, thy lot exceeds Mine far; while I, with any pittance pleased, Bear to my ships the little that I win After long battle, and account it much. But I am gone, I and my sable barks (My wiser course) to Phthia, and I judge, Scorn'd as I am, that thou shalt hardly glean Without me, more than thou shalt soon consume. He ceased, and Agamemnon thus replied. Fly, and fly now; if in thy soul thou feel Such ardour of desire to go—begone! I woo thee not to stay; stay not an hour On my behalf, for I have others here Who will respect me more, and above all All-judging Jove. There is not in the host King or commander whom I hate as thee, For all thy pleasure is in strife and blood, And at all times; yet valour is no ground Whereon to boast, it is the gift of Heaven. Go, get ye back to Phthia, thou and thine! There rule thy Myrmidons. I need not thee, Nor heed thy wrath a jot. But this I say, Sure as Apollo takes my lovely prize Chrysëis, and I shall return her home In mine own bark, and with my proper crew, So sure the fair Brisëis shall be mine. I shall demand her even at thy tent. So shalt thou well be taught, how high in power I soar above thy pitch, and none shall dare Attempt, thenceforth, comparison with me. He ended, and the big disdainful heart Throbbed of Achilles; racking doubt ensued And sore perplex'd him, whether forcing wide A passage through them, with his blade unsheathed To lay Atrides breathless at his foot, Or to command his stormy spirit down. So doubted he, and undecided yet Stood drawing forth his falchion huge; when lo! Down sent by Juno, to whom both alike Were dear, and who alike watched over both, Pallas descended. At his back she stood To none apparent, save himself alone, And seized his golden locks. Startled, he turned, And instant knew Minerva. Flashed her eyes Terrific; whom with accents on the wing Of haste, incontinent he questioned thus. Daughter of Jove, why comest thou? that thyself May'st witness these affronts which I endure From Agamemnon? Surely as I speak, This moment, for his arrogance, he dies. To whom the blue-eyed Deity. From heaven Mine errand is, to sooth, if thou wilt hear, Thine anger. Juno the white-arm'd, alike To him and thee propitious, bade me down: Restrain thy wrath. Draw not thy faulchion forth. Retort, and sharply, and let that suffice. For I foretell thee true. Thou shalt receive, Some future day, thrice told, thy present loss For this day's wrong. Cease, therefore, and be still. To whom Achilles. Goddess, although much Exasperate, I dare not disregard Thy word, which to obey is always best. Who hears the Gods, the Gods hear also him. He said; and on his silver hilt the force Of his broad hand impressing, sent the blade Home to its rest, nor would the counsel scorn Of Pallas. She to heaven well-pleased return'd, And in the mansion of Jove Ægis The shield of Jupiter, made by Vulcan, and so called from its covering, which was the skin of the goat that suckled him.-armed Arriving, mingled with her kindred Gods. But though from violence, yet not from words Abstained Achilles, but with bitter taunt Opprobrious, his antagonist reproached. Oh charged with wine, in stedfastness of face Dog unabashed, and yet at heart a deer! Thou never, when the troops have taken arms, Hast dared to take thine also; never thou Associate with Achaia's Chiefs, to form The secret ambush. No. The sound of war Is as the voice of destiny to thee. Doubtless the course is safer far, to range Our numerous host, and if a man have dared Dispute thy will, to rob him of his prize. King! over whom? Women and spiritless— Whom therefore thou devourest; else themselves Would stop that mouth that it should scoff no more. But hearken. I shall swear a solemn oath. By this same sceptre, which shall never bud, Nor boughs bring forth as once, which having left Its stock on the high mountains, at what time The woodman's axe lopped off its foliage green, And stript it's bark, shall never grow again; Which now the judges of Achaia bear, Who under Jove, stand guardians of the laws, By this I swear (mark thou the sacred oath) Time shall be, when Achilles shall be missed; When all shall want him, and thyself the power To help the Achaians, whatsoe'er thy will; When Hector at your heels shall mow you down; The Hero-slaughtering Hector! Then thy soul, Vexation-stung, shall tear thee with remorse, That thou hast scorn'd, as he were nothing worth, A Chief, the soul and bulwark of your cause. So saying, he cast his sceptre on the ground Studded with gold, and sat. On the other side The son of Atreus all impassion'd stood, When the harmonious orator arose Nestor, the Pylian oracle, whose lips Dropped eloquence—the honey not so sweet. Two generations past of mortals born In Pylus, coëtaneous with himself, He govern'd now the third—amid them all He stood, and thus, benevolent, began. Ah! what calamity hath fall'n on Greece! Now Priam and his sons may well exult, Now all in Ilium shall have joy of heart Abundant, hearing of this broil, the prime Of Greece between, in council and in arms. But be persuaded; ye are younger both Than I, and I was conversant of old With Princes your superiors, yet from them No disrespect at any time received. Their equals saw I never; never shall; Exadius, Cœneus, and the God-like son Of Ægeus, mighty Theseus; men renown'd For force superior to the race of man. Brave Chiefs they were, and with brave foes they fought, With the rude dwellers on the mountain-heights The Centaurs, whom with havock such as fame Shall never cease to celebrate, they slew. With these men I consorted erst, what time From Pylus, though a land from theirs remote, They called me forth, and such as was my strength, With all that strength I served them. Who is he? What Prince or Chief of the degenerate race Now seen on earth who might with these compare? Yet even these would listen and conform To my advice in consultation given, Which hear ye also; for compliance proves Oft times the safer and the manlier course. Thou, Agamemnon! valiant as thou art, Seize not the maid, his portion from the Greeks, But leave her his; nor thou, Achilles, strive With our imperial Chief; for never King Had equal honour at the hands of Jove With Agamemnon, or was throned so high. Say thou art stronger, and art Goddess-born, How then? His territory passes thine, And he is Lord of thousands more than thou. Cease, therefore, Agamemnon; calm thy wrath; And it shall be mine office to entreat Achilles also to a calm, whose might The chief munition is of all our host. To whom the sovereign of the Greeks replied, The son of Atreus. Thou hast spoken well, Old Chief, and wisely. But this wrangler here— Nought will suffice him but the highest place; He must controul us all, reign over all, Dictate to all; but he shall find at least One here, disposed to question his commands. If the eternal Gods have made him brave, Derives he thence a privilege to rail? Whom thus Achilles interrupted fierce. Could I be found so abject as to take The measure of my doings at thy lips, Well might they call me coward through the camp, A vassal, and a fellow of no worth. Give law to others. Think not to controul Me, subject to thy proud commands no more. Hear yet again! And weigh what thou shalt hear. I will not strive with thee in such a cause, Nor yet with any man; I scorn to fight For her, whom having given, ye take away. But I have other precious things on board; Of those take none away without my leave. Or if it please thee, put me to the proof Before this whole assembly, and my spear Shall stream that moment, purpled with thy blood. Thus they long time in opposition fierce Maintained the war of words; and now, at length, (The grand consult dissolved,) Achilles walked, (Patroclus and the Myrmidons his steps Attending) to his camp and to his fleet. But Agamemnon order'd forth a bark, A swift one, manned with twice ten lusty rowers; He sent on board the Hecatomb: he placed Chryseis with the blooming cheeks, himself, And to Ulysses gave the freight in charge. So all embarked, and plow'd their watery way. Atrides, next, bade purify the host; The host was purified, as he enjoin'd, And the ablution cast into the sea. Then to Apollo, on the shore they slew, Of the untillable and barren deep, Whole Hetacombs of bulls and goats, whose steam Slowly in smoky volumes climbed the skies. Thus was the camp employed; nor ceased the while The son of Atreus from his threats denounced At first against Achilles, but command Gave to Talthybius and Eurybates His heralds, ever faithful to his will. Haste—Seek ye both the tent of Peleus' son Achilles. Thence lead hither by the hand Blooming Briseis, whom if he withhold, Not her alone, but other spoil myself Will take in person—He shall rue the hour. With such harsh message charged he them dismissed. They, sad and slow, beside the barren waste Of Ocean, to the galleys and the tents Moved of the Myrmidons. Him there they found Beneath the shadow of his bark reclined, Nor glad at their approach. Trembling they stood, In presence of the royal Chief, awe-struck, Nor questioned him or spake. He not the less Knew well their embassy, and thus began. Ye heralds, messengers of Gods and men, Hail, and draw near! I bid you welcome both. I blame not you; the fault is his alone Who sends you to conduct the damsel hence Brisëis. Go Patroclus, generous friend! Lead forth, and to their guidance give the maid. But be themselves my witnesses before The blessed Gods, before mankind, before The ruthless king, should want of me be felt To save the host from havoc The original is here abrupt, and expresses the precipitancy of the speaker by a most beautiful aposiopesis.—Oh, his thoughts Are madness all; intelligence or skill Forecast or retrospect, how best the camp May be secured from inroad, none hath he. He ended, nor Patroclus disobey'd, But leading beautiful Brisëis forth Into their guidance gave her; loth she went From whom she loved, and looking oft behind. Then wept Achilles, and apart from all, With eyes directed to the gloomy Deep And arms outstretch'd, his mother suppliant sought. Since, mother, though ordain'd so soon to die, I am thy son, I might with cause expect Some honour at the Thunderer's hands, but none To me he shows, whom Agamemnon, Chief Of the Achaians, hath himself disgraced, Seizing by violence my just reward. So prayed he weeping, whom his mother heard Within the gulfs of Ocean where she sat Beside her ancient sire. From the gray flood Ascending sudden, like a mist, she came, Sat down before him, stroaked his face, and said. Why weeps my son? and what is thy distress? Hide not a sorrow that I wish to share. To whom Achilles, sighing deep, replied. Why tell thee woes to thee already known? At Thebes, Eëtion's city we arrived, Smote, sack'd it, and brought all the spoil away. Just distribution made among the Greeks, The son of Atreus for his lot received Blooming Chrysëis. Her, Apollo's priest Old Chryses followed to Achaia's camp, That he might loose his daughter. Ransom rich He brought, and in his hands the hallow'd wreath And golden sceptre of the Archer God Apollo, bore; to the whole Greecian host, But chiefly to the foremost in command He sued, the sons of Atreus; then, the rest All recommended reverence of the Seer, And prompt acceptance of his costly gifts. But Agamemnon might not so be pleased, Who gave him rude dismission; he in wrath Returning, prayed, whose prayer Apollo heard, For much he loved him. A pestiferous shaft He instant shot into the Greecian host, And heap'd the people died. His arrows swept The whole wide camp of Greece, 'till at the last A Seer, by Phœbus taught, explain'd the cause. I first advised propitiation. Rage Fired Agamemnon. Rising, he denounced Vengeance, and hath fulfilled it. She, in truth, Is gone to Chrysa, and with her we send Propitiation also to the King Shaft-arm'd Apollo. But my beauteous prize Brisëis, mine by the award of all, His Heralds, at this moment, lead away. But thou, wherein thou canst, aid thy own son! Haste hence to Heaven, and if thy word or deed Hath ever gratified the heart of Jove, With earnest suit press him on my behalf. For I, not seldom, in my father's hall Have heard thee boasting, how when once the Gods, With Juno, Neptune, Pallas at their head, Conspired to bind the Thunderer, thou did'st loose His bands, O Goddess! calling to his aid The Hundred-handed warrior, by the Gods Briareus, but by men Ægeon named. For he in prowess and in might surpassed His father Neptune, who, enthroned sublime, Sits second only to Saturnian Jove, Elate with glory and joy. Him all the Gods Fearing from that bold enterprise abstained. Now, therefore, of these things reminding Jove, Embrace his knees; entreat him that he give The host of Troy his succour, and shut fast The routed Greecians, prisoners in the fleet, That all may find much solace ??????????. in their King, And that the mighty sovereign o'er them all, Their Agamemnon, may himself be taught His rashness, who hath thus dishonour'd foul The life itself, and bulwark of his cause. To him, with streaming eyes, Thetis replied. Born as thou wast to sorrow, ah, my son! Why have I rear'd thee! Would that without tears, Or cause for tears (transient as is thy life, A little span) thy days might pass at Troy! But short and sorrowful the fates ordain Thy life, peculiar trouble must be thine, Whom, therefore, oh that I had never borne! But seeking the Olympian hill snow-crown'd, I will myself plead for thee in the ear Of Jove, the Thunderer. Meantime at thy fleet Abiding, let thy wrath against the Greeks Still burn, and altogether cease from war. For to the banks of the Oceanus A name by which we are frequently to understand the Nile in Homer., Where Æthiopia holds a feast to Jove, He journey'd yesterday, with whom the Gods Went also, and the twelfth day brings them home. Then will I to his brazen-floor'd abode, That I may clasp his knees, and much misdeem Of my endeavour, or my prayer shall speed. So saying, she went; but him she left enraged For fair Brisëis sake, forced from his arms By stress of power. Meantime Ulysses came To Chrysa with the Hecatomb in charge. Arrived within the haven The original word (???????????) seems to express variety of soundings, an idea probably not to be conveyed in an English epithet. deep, their sails Furling, they stowed them in the bark below. Then by its tackle lowering swift the mast Into its crutch, they briskly push'd to land, Heaved anchors out, and moor'd the vessel fast. Forth came the mariners, and trod the beach; Forth came the victims of Apollo next, And, last, Chrysëis. Her Ulysses led Toward the altar, gave her to the arms Of her own father, and him thus address'd. O Chryses! Agamemnon, King of men, Hath sent thy daughter home, with whom we bring An Hecatomb on all our host's behalf To Phœbus, hoping to appease the God By whose dread shafts the Argives now expire. So saying, he gave her to him, who with joy Received his daughter. Then, before the shrine Magnificent in order due they ranged The noble Hecatomb. Each laved his hands And took the salted meal, and Chryses made His fervent prayer with hands upraised on high. God of the silver bow, who with thy power Encirclest Chrysa, and who reign'st supreme In Tenedos, and Cilla the divine! Thou prov'dst propitious to my first request, Hast honour'd me, and punish'd sore the Greeks; Hear yet thy servant's prayer; take from their host At once the loathsome pestilence away! So Chryses prayed, whom Phœbus heard well-pleased; Then prayed the Greecians also, and with meal Sprinkling the victims, their retracted necks First pierced, then flay'd them; the disjointed thighs They, next, invested with the double cawl, Which with crude slices thin they overspread. The priest burned incence, and libation poured Large on the hissing brands, while, him beside, Busy with spit and prong, stood many a youth Trained to the task. The thighs with fire consumed, They gave to each his portion of the maw, Then slashed the remnant, pierced it with the spits, And managing with culinary skill The roast, withdrew it from the spits again. Their whole task thus accomplish'd, and the board Set forth, they feasted, and were all sufficed. When neither hunger more nor thirst remained Unsatisfied, boys crown'd the beakers high With wine delicious, and from right to left Distributing the cups, served every guest. Thenceforth the youths of the Achaian race To song propitiatory gave the day, Pæans to Phœbus, Archer of the skies, Chaunting melodious. Pleased, Apollo heard. But, when, the sun descending, darkness fell, They on the beach beside their hawsers slept; And, when the day-spring's daughter rosy-palm'd Aurora look'd abroad, then back they steer'd To the vast camp. Fair wind, and blowing fresh, Apollo sent them; quick they rear'd the mast, Then spread the unsullied canvass to the gale, And the wind filled it. Roared the sable flood Around the bark, that ever as she went Dash'd wide the brine, and scudded swift away. Thus reaching soon the spacious camp of Greece, Their galley they updrew sheer o'er the sands From the rude surge remote, then propp'd her sides With scantlings long, and sought their several tents. But Peleus' noble son, the speed-renown'd Achilles, he, his well-built bark beside, Consumed his hours, nor would in council more, Where wise men win distinction, or in fight Appear, to sorrow and heart-withering woe Abandon'd; though for battle, ardent, still He panted, and the shout-resounding field. But when the twelfth fair morrow streak'd the East, Then all the everlasting Gods to Heaven Resorted, with the Thunderer at their head, And Thetis, not unmindful of her son From the salt flood emerged, seeking betimes Olympus and the boundless fields of heaven. High, on the topmost eminence sublime Of the deep-fork'd Olympian she perceived The Thunderer seated, from the Gods apart. She sat before him, clasped with her left hand His knees, her right beneath his chin she placed, And thus the King, Saturnian Jove, implored. Father of all, by all that I have done Or said that ever pleased thee, grant my suit. Exalt my son, by destiny short-lived Beyond the lot of others. Him with shame The King of men hath overwhelm'd, by force Usurping his just meed; thou, therefore, Jove, Supreme in wisdom, honour him, and give Success to Troy, till all Achaia's sons Shall yield him honour more than he hath lost! She spake, to whom the Thunderer nought replied, But silent sat long time. She, as her hand Had grown there, still importunate, his knees Clasp'd as at first, and thus her suit renew'd. Or grant my prayer, and ratify the grant, Or send me hence, (for thou hast none to fear,) Plainly refused; that I may know and feel By how much I am least of all in heaven. To whom the cloud-assembler at the last Spake, deep-distress'd. Hard task and full of strife Thou hast enjoined me; Juno will not spare For gibe and taunt injurious, whose complaint Sounds daily in the ears of all the Gods, That I assist the Trojans; but depart, Lest she observe thee; my concern shall be How best I may perform thy full desire. And to assure thee more, I give the sign Indubitable, which all fear expels At once from heavenly minds. Nought, so confirmed, May, after, be reversed or render'd vain. He ceased, and under his dark brows the nod Vouchsafed of confirmation. All around The Sovereign's everlasting head his curls Ambrosial shook, and the huge mountain reeled. Their conference closed, they parted. She, at once, From bright Olympus plunged into the flood Profound, and Jove to his own courts withdrew. Together all the Gods, at his approach, Uprose; none sat expectant till he came, But all advanced to meet the Eternal Sire. So on his throne he sat. Nor Juno him Not understood; she, watchful, had observed, In consultation close with Jove engaged Thetis, bright-footed daughter of the deep, And keen the son of Saturn thus reproved. Shrewd as thou art, who now hath had thine ear? Thy joy is ever such, from me apart To plan and plot clandestine, and thy thoughts, Think what thou may'st, are always barred to me. To whom the father, thus, of heaven and earth. Expect not, Juno, that thou shalt partake My counsels at all times, which oft in height And depth, thy comprehension far exceed, Jove's consort as thou art. When aught occurs Meet for thine ear, to none will I impart Of Gods or men more free than to thyself. But for my secret thoughts, which I withhold From all in heaven beside, them search not thou With irksome curiosity and vain. Him answer'd then the Goddess ample-eyed. What word hath passed thy lips, Saturnian Jove, Thou most severe! I never search thy thoughts, Nor the serenity of thy profound Intentions trouble; they are safe from me: But now there seems a cause. Deeply I dread Lest Thetis, silver-footed daughter fair Of Ocean's hoary Sovereign, here arrived At early dawn to practise on thee, Jove! I noticed her a suitress at thy knees, And much misdeem or promise-bound thou stand'st To Thetis past recall, to exalt her son, And Greeks to slaughter thousands at the ships. To whom the cloud-assembler God, incensed. Ah subtle! ever teeming with surmise, And fathomer of my concealed designs, Thy toil is vain, or (which is worse for thee,) Shall but estrange thee from mine heart the more. And be it as thou sayest,—I am well pleased That so it should be. Be advised, desist, Hold thou thy peace. Else, if my glorious hands Once reach thee, the Olympian Powers combined To rescue thee, shall interfere in vain. He said,—whom Juno, awful Goddess, heard Appall'd, and mute submitted to his will. But through the courts of Jove the heavenly Powers All felt displeasure; when to them arose Vulcan, illustrious artist, who with speech Conciliatory interposed to sooth His white-arm'd mother Juno, Goddess dread. Hard doom is ours, and not to be endured, If feast and merriment must pause in heaven While ye such clamour raise tumultuous here For man's unworthy sake: yet thus we speed Ever, when evil overpoises good. But I exhort my mother, though herself Already warn'd, that meekly she submit To Jove our father, lest our father chide More roughly, and confusion mar the feast. For the Olympian Thunderer could with ease Us from our thrones precipitate, so far He reigns to all superior. Seek to assuage His anger therefore; so shall he with smiles Cheer thee, nor thee alone, but all in heaven. So Vulcan, and, upstarting, placed a cup Full-charged between his mother's hands, and said, My mother, be advised, and, though aggrieved, Yet patient; lest I see thee whom I love So dear, with stripes chastised before my face, Willing, but impotent to give thee aid. Who can resist the Thunderer? Me, when once I flew to save thee, by the foot he seized And hurl'd me through the portal of the skies. “From morn to eve I fell, a summer's day,” And dropped, at last, in Lemnos. There half-dead The Sintians found me, and with succour prompt And hospitable, entertained me fallen. So He; then Juno smiled, Goddess white-arm'd, And smiling still, from his unwonted hand The reader, in order that he may partake with the Gods in the drollery of this scene, should observe that the crippled and distorted Vulcan had thrust himself into an office at all other times administered either by Hebe or Ganymede. Received the goblet. He from right to left Rich nectar from the beaker drawn, alert Distributed to all the powers divine. Heaven rang with laughter inextinguishable Peal after peal, such pleasure all conceived At sight of Vulcan in his new employ. So spent they in festivity the day, And all were cheered; nor was Apollo's harp Silent, nor did the Muses spare to add Responsive melody of vocal sweets. But when the sun's bright orb had now declined, Each to his mansion, wheresoever built By the lame matchless Architect, withdrew. Jove also, kindler of the fires of heaven, His couch ascending as at other times When gentle sleep approach'd him, slept serene, With golden-sceptred Juno at his side. BOOK II. ARGUMENT OF THE SECOND BOOK. Jupiter, in pursuance of his purpose to distress the Greecians in answer to the prayer of Thetis, deceives Agamemnon by a dream. He, in consequence of it, calls a council, the result of which is that the army shall go forth to battle. Thersites is mutinous, and is chastised by Ulysses. Ulysses, Nestor, and Agamemnon harangue the people; and preparation is made for battle. An exact account follows of the forces on both sides. All night both Gods and Chiefs equestrian slept, But not the Sire of all. He, waking soon, Mused how to exalt Achilles, and destroy No few in battle at the Greecian fleet. This counsel, at the last, as best he chose And likeliest; to dispatch an evil Dream To Agamemnon's tent, and to his side The phantom summoning, him thus addressed. Haste, evil Dream! Fly to the Greecian fleet, And, entering royal Agamemnon's tent, His ear possess thou thus, omitting nought Of all that I enjoin thee. Bid him arm His universal host, for that the time When the Achaians shall at length possess Wide Ilium, hath arrived. The Gods above No longer dwell at variance. The request Of Juno hath prevail'd; now, Woe to Troy! So charged, the Dream departed. At the ships Well-built arriving of Achaia's host, He Agamemnon, son of Atreus, sought. Him sleeping in his tent he found, immersed In soft repose ambrosial. At his head The shadow stood, similitude exact Of Nestor, son of Neleus; sage, with whom In Agamemnon's thought might none compare. His form assumed, the sacred Dream began. O son of Atreus the renown'd in arms And in the race! Sleep'st thou? It ill behoves To sleep all night the man of high employ, And charged, as thou art, with a people's care. Now, therefore, mark me well, who, sent from Jove, Inform thee, that although so far remote, He yet compassionates and thinks on thee With kind solicitude. He bids thee arm Thine universal host, for that the time When the Achaians shall at length possess Wide Ilium, hath arrived. The Gods above No longer dwell at variance. The requests Of Juno have prevail'd. Now, woe to Troy From Jove himself! Her fate is on the wing. Awaking from thy dewy slumbers, hold In firm remembrance all that thou hast heard. So spake the Dream, and vanishing, him left In false hopes occupied and musings vain. Full sure he thought, ignorant of the plan By Jove design'd, that day the last of Troy. Fond thought! For toils and agonies to Greeks And Trojans both, in many a bloody field To be endured, the Thunderer yet ordain'd. Starting he woke, and seeming still to hear The warning voice divine, with hasty leap Sprang from his bed, and sat. His fleecy vest New-woven he put on, and mantle wide; His sandals fair to his unsullied feet He braced, and slung his argent-studded sword. Then, incorruptible for evermore The sceptre of his sires he took, with which He issued forth into the camp of Greece. Aurora now on the Olympian heights Proclaiming stood new day to all in heaven, When he his clear-voiced heralds bade convene The Greeks in council. Went the summons forth Into all quarters, and the throng began. First, at the ship of Nestor, Pylian King, The senior Chiefs for high exploits renown'd He gather'd, whom he prudent thus address'd. My fellow-warriors, hear! A dream from heaven, Amid the stillness of the vacant night Approach'd me, semblance close in stature, bulk, And air, of noble Nestor. At mine head The shadow took his stand, and thus he spake. Oh son of Atreus the renown'd in arms And in the race, sleep'st thou? It ill behoves To sleep all night the man of high employ, And charged as thou art with a people's care. Now, therefore, mark me well, who, sent from Jove, Inform thee, that although so far remote, He yet compassionates and thinks on thee With kind solicitude. He bids thee arm Thine universal host; for that the time When the Achaians shall at length possess Wide Ilium, hath arrived. The Gods above No longer dwell at variance. The requests Of Juno have prevail'd. Now, woe to Troy From Jove himself! Her fate is on the wing. Charge this on thy remembrance. Thus he spake, Then vanished suddenly, and I awoke. Haste therefore, let us arm, if arm we may Agamemnon seems to entertain some doubts lest the army should so resent his treatment of their favourite Achilles, as to be indisposed to serve him., The warlike sons of Greece; but first, myself Will prove them, recommending instant flight With all our ships, and ye throughout the host Dispersed, shall, next, encourage all to stay. He ceased, and sat; when in the midst arose Of highest fame for wisdom, Nestor, King Of sandy Pylus, who them thus bespake. Friends, Counsellors, and Leaders of the Greeks! Had any meaner Argive told his dream, We had pronounced it false, and should the more Have shrunk from battle; but the dream is his Who boasts himself our highest in command. Haste, arm we, if we may, the sons of Greece. So saying, he left the council; him, at once, The sceptred Chiefs, obedient to his voice, Arising, follow'd; and the throng began. As from the hollow rock bees stream abroad, And in succession endless seek the fields, Now clustering, and now scattered far and near, In spring-time, among all the new-blown flowers, So they to council swarm'd, troop after troop, Greecians of every tribe, from camp and fleet Assembling orderly o'er all the plain Beside the shore of Ocean. In the midst A kindling rumour, messenger of Jove, Impell'd them, and they went. Loud was the din Of the assembling thousands; groan'd the earth When down they sat, and murmurs ran around. Nine heralds cried aloud—Will ye restrain Your clamours, that your heaven-taught Kings may speak? Scarce were they settled, and the clang had ceased, When Agamemnon, sovereign o'er them all, Sceptre in hand, arose. (That sceptre erst Vulcan with labour forged and to the hand Consign'd it of the King, Saturnian Jove; Jove to the vanquisher Mercury. of Ino's Argus. guard, And he to Pelops; Pelops in his turn, To royal Atreus; Atreus at his death Bequeath'd it to Thyestes rich in flocks, And rich Thyestes left it to be borne By Agamemnon, symbol of his right To empire over Argos and her isles) On that he lean'd, and, rapid, thus began. Friends, Greecian Heroes, ministers of Mars! Ye see me here entangled in the snares Of unpropitious Jove. He promised once, And with a nod confirm'd it, that with spoils Of Ilium laden, we should hence return; But now, devising ill, he sends me shamed, And with diminished numbers, home to Greece. So stands his sovereign pleasure, who hath laid The bulwarks of full many a city low, And more shall level, matchless in his might. That such a numerous host of Greeks as we, Warring with fewer than ourselves, should find No fruit of all our toil, (and none appears) Will make us vile with ages yet to come. For should we now strike truce, till Greece and Troy Might number each her own, and were the Greeks Distributed in bands, ten Greeks in each, Our banded decads should exceed so far Their units, that all Troy could not supply For every ten, a man, to fill us wine; So far the Achaians, in my thought, surpass The native Trojans. But in Troy are those Who baffle much my purpose; aids derived From other states, spear-arm'd auxiliars, firm In the defence of Ilium's lofty towers. Nine years have passed us over, nine long years; Our ships are rotted, and our tackle marr'd, And all our wives and little-ones at home Sit watching our return, while this attempt Hangs still in doubt, for which that home we left. Accept ye then my counsel. Fly we swift With all our fleet back to our native land, Hopeless of Troy, not yet to be subdued. So spake the King, whom all the concourse heard With minds in tumult toss'd; all, save the few, Partners of his intent. Commotion shook The whole assembly, such as heaves the flood Of the Icarian Deep, when South and East Burst forth together from the clouds of Jove. And as when vehement the West-wind falls On standing corn mature, the loaded ears Innumerable bow before the gale, So was the council shaken. With a shout All flew toward the ships; upraised, the dust Stood o'er them; universal was the cry, “Now clear the passages, strike down the props, Set every vessel free, launch, and away!” Heaven rang with exclamation of the host All homeward bent, and launching glad the fleet. Then baffled Fate had the Achaians seen Returning premature, but Juno thus, With admonition quick to Pallas spake. Unconquer'd daughter of Jove Ægis-arm'd! Ah foul dishonour! Is it thus at last That the Achaians on the billows borne, Shall seek again their country, leaving here, To be the vaunt of Ilium and her King, Helen of Argos, in whose cause the Greeks Have numerous perish'd from their home remote? Haste! Seek the mail-arm'd multitude, by force Detain them of thy soothing speech, ere yet All launch their oary barks into the flood. She spake, nor did Minerva not comply, But darting swift from the Olympian heights, Reach'd soon Achaia's fleet. There, she perceived Prudent as Jove himself, Ulysses; firm He stood; he touch'd not even with his hand His sable bark, for sorrow whelm'd his soul. The Athenæan Goddess azure-eyed Beside him stood, and thus the Chief bespake. Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd! Why seek ye, thus precipitate, your ships? Intend ye flight? And is it thus at last, That the Achaians on the billows borne, Shall seek again their country, leaving here, To be the vaunt of Ilium and her King, Helen of Argos, in whose cause the Greeks Have numerous perish'd from their home remote? Delay not. Rush into the throng; by force Detain them of thy soothing speech, ere yet All launch their oary barks into the flood. She ceased, whom by her voice Ulysses knew, Casting his mantle from him, which his friend Eurybates the Ithacensian caught, He ran; and in his course meeting the son Of Atreus, Agamemnon, from his hand The everlasting sceptre quick received, Which bearing, through Achaia's fleet he pass'd. What King soever, or distinguish'd Greek He found, approaching to his side, in terms Of gentle sort he stay'd him. Sir, he cried, It is unseemly that a man renown'd As thou, should tremble. Go—Resume the seat Which thou hast left, and bid the people sit. Thou know'st not clearly yet the monarch's mind. He proves us now, but soon he will chastize. All were not present; few of us have heard His speech this day in council. Oh, beware, Lest in resentment of this hasty course Irregular, he let his anger loose. Dread is the anger of a King; he reigns By Jove's own ordinance, and is dear to Jove. But what plebeian base soe'er he heard Stretching his throat to swell the general cry, He lay'd the sceptre smartly on his back, With reprimand severe. Fellow, he said, Sit still; hear others; thy superiors hear. For who art thou? A dastard and a drone, Of none account in council, or in arms. By no means may we all alike bear sway At Ilium; such plurality of Kings Were evil. One suffices. One, to whom The son of politic Saturn hath assign'd The sceptre, and inforcement of the laws, That he may rule us as a monarch ought. With such authority the troubled host He sway'd; they, quitting camp and fleet again, Rush'd back to council; deafening was the sound As when a billow of the boisterous deep Some broad beach dashes, and the ocean roars. The host all seated, and the benches fill'd, Thersites only of loquacious tongue Ungovern'd, clamour'd mutinous; a wretch Of utterance prompt, but in coarse phrase obscene Deep learn'd alone, with which to slander Kings. Might he but set the rabble in a roar, He cared not with what jest; of all from Greece To Ilium sent, his country's chief reproach. Cross-eyed he was, and halting moved on legs Ill-pair'd; his gibbous shoulders o'er his breast Contracted, pinch'd it; to a peak his head Was moulded sharp, and sprinkled thin with hair Of starveling length, flimsy and soft as down. Achilles and Ulysses had incurr'd Most his aversion; them he never spared; But now, imperial Agamemnon 'self In piercing accents stridulous he charged With foul reproach. The Greecians with contempt Listen'd, and indignation, while with voice At highest pitch, he thus the monarch mock'd. What would'st thou now? Whereof is thy complaint Now, Agamemnon? Thou hast fill'd thy tents With treasure, and the Greecians, when they take A city, chuse the loveliest girls for thee. Is gold thy wish? More gold? A ransom brought By some chief Trojan for his son's release Whom I, or other valiant Greek may bind? Or would'st thou yet a virgin, one, by right Another's claim, but made by force thine own? It was not well, great Sir, that thou shouldst bring A plague on the Achaians, as of late. But come, my Greecian sisters, soldiers named Unfitly, of a sex too soft for war, Come, let us homeward: let him here digest What he shall gorge, alone; that he may learn If our assistance profit him or not. For when he shamed Achilles, he disgraced A Chief far worthier than himself, whose prize He now withholds. But tush,—Achilles lacks Himself the spirit of a man; no gall Hath he within him, or his hand long since Had stopp'd that mouth The extremest provocation is implied in this expression, which Thersites quotes exactly as he had heard it from the lips of Achilles., that it should scoff no more. Thus, mocking royal Agamemnon, spake Thersites. Instant starting to his side, Noble Ulysses with indignant brows Survey'd him, and him thus reproved severe. Thersites! Railer!—peace. Think not thyself, Although thus eloquent, alone exempt From obligation not to slander Kings. I deem thee most contemptible, the worst Of Agamemnon's followers to the war; Presume not then to take the names revered Of Sovereigns on thy sordid lips, to asperse Their sacred character, and to appoint The Greeks a time when they shall voyage home. How soon, how late, with what success at last We shall return, we know not: but because Achaia's heroes numerous spoils allot To Agamemnon, Leader of the host, Thou therefore from thy seat revilest the King. But mark me. If I find thee, as even now, Raving and foaming at the lips again, May never man behold Ulysses' head On these my shoulders more, and may my son Prove the begotten of another Sire, If I not strip thee to that hide of thine As bare as thou wast born, and whip thee hence Home to thy galley, sniveling like a boy. He ceased, and with his sceptre on the back And shoulders smote him. Writhing to and fro, He wept profuse, while many a bloody whelk Protuberant beneath the sceptre sprang. Awe-quell'd he sat, and from his visage mean, Deep-sighing, wiped the rheums. It was no time For mirth, yet mirth illumined every face, And laughing, thus they spake. A thousand acts Illustrious, both by well-concerted plans And prudent disposition of the host Ulysses hath achieved, but this by far Transcends his former praise, that he hath quell'd Such contumelious rhetoric profuse. The valiant talker shall not soon, we judge, Take liberties with royal names again. So spake the multitude. Then, stretching forth The sceptre, city-spoiler Chief, arose Ulysses. Him beside, herald in form, Appeared Minerva. Silence she enjoined To all, that all Achaia's sons might hear, Foremost and rearmost, and might weigh his words. He then his counsel, prudent, thus proposed. Atrides! Monarch! The Achaians seek To make thee ignominious above all In sight of all mankind. None recollects His promise more in steed-famed Argos pledged, Here to abide till Ilium wall'd to heaven Should vanquish'd sink, and all her wealth be ours. No—now, like widow'd women, or weak boys, They whimper to each other, wishing home. And home, I grant, to the afflicted soul Seems pleasant Some for ????? here read ?????; which reading I have adopted for the sake both of perspicuity and connexion. The poor seaman from his wife One month detain'd, cheerless his ship and sad Possesses, by the force of wintry blasts, And by the billows of the troubled deep Fast lock'd in port. But us the ninth long year Revolving, finds camp'd under Ilium still. I therefore blame not, if they mourn beside Their sable barks, the Greecians. Yet the shame That must attend us after absence long Returning unsuccessful, who can bear? Be patient, friends! wait only till we learn If Calchas truly prophecied, or not; For well we know, and I to all appeal, Whom Fate hath not already snatch'd away, (It seems but yesterday, or at the most A day or two before,) that when the ships Woe-fraught for Priam, and the race of Troy, At Aulis met, and we beside the fount With perfect hecatombs the Gods adored Beneath the plane-tree, from whose root a stream Ran crystal-clear, there we beheld a sign Wonderful in all eyes. A serpent huge, Tremendous spectacle! with crimson spots His back all dappled, by Olympian Jove Himself protruded, from the altar's foot Slipp'd into light, and glided to the tree. There on the topmost bough, close-cover'd sat With foliage broad, eight sparrows, younglings all, Then newly feather'd, with their dam, the ninth. The little ones lamenting shrill he gorged, While, wheeling o'er his head, with screams the dam Bewail'd her darling brood. Her also, next, Hovering and clamouring, he by the wing Within his spiry folds drew, and devoured. All eaten thus, the nestlings and the dam, The God who sent him, signalized him too, For him Saturnian Jove transform'd to stone. We wondering stood, to see that strange portent Intrude itself into our holy rites, When Calchas, instant, thus the sign explain'd. Why stand ye, Greeks, astonish'd? Ye behold A prodigy by Jove himself pruduced, An omen, whose accomplishment indeed Is distant, but whose fame shall never die. E'en as this serpent in your sight devour'd Eight youngling sparrows, with their dam, the ninth, So we nine years must war on yonder plain, And in the tenth, wide-bulwark'd Troy is ours. So spake the seer, and as he spake, is done. Wait, therefore, brave Achaians! go not hence Till Priam's spacious city be your prize. He ceased, and such a shout ensued, that all The hollow ships the deafening roar return'd Of acclamation, every voice the speech Extolling of Ulysses, glorious Chief. Then Nestor the Gerenian, warrior old, Arising, spake; and, by the Gods, he said, Ye more resemble children inexpert In war, than disciplined and prudent men. Where now are all your promises and vows, Councils, libations, right-hand covenants? Burn them, since all our occupation here Is to debate and wrangle, whereof end Or fruit though long we wait, shall none be found. But, Sovereign, be not thou appall'd. Be firm. Relax not aught of thine accustomed sway, But set the battle forth as thou art wont. And if there be a Greecian, here and there, One Nestor is supposed here to glance at Achilles., adverse to the general voice, let such Wither alone. He shall not see his wish Gratified, neither will we hence return To Argos, ere events shall yet have proved Jove's promise false or true. For when we climb'd Our gallant barks full-charged with Ilium's fate, Saturnian Jove omnipotent, that day, (Omen propitious!) thunder'd on the right. Let no man therefore pant for home, till each Possess a Trojan spouse, and from her lips Take sweet revenge for Helen's pangs of heart. Who then? What soldier languishes and sighs To leave us? Let him dare to lay his hand On his own vessel, and he dies the first. But hear, O King! I shall suggest a course Not trivial. Agamemnon! sort the Greeks By districts and by tribes, that tribe may tribe Support, and each his fellow. This performed, And with consent of all, thou shalt discern With ease what Chief, what private man deserts, And who performs his part. The base, the brave, Such disposition made, shall both appear; And thou shalt also know, if heaven or we, The Gods, or our supineness, succour Troy. To whom Atrides, King of men, replied. Old Chief! Thou passest all Achaia's sons In consultation; would to Jove our Sire, To Athenæan Pallas, and Apollo! That I had ten such coadjutors, wise As thou art, and the royal city soon Of Priam, with her wealth, should all be ours. But me the son of Saturn, Jove supreme Himself afflicts, who in contentious broils Involves me, and in altercation vain. Thence all that wordy tempest for a girl Achilles and myself between, and I The fierce aggressor. Be that breach but heal'd! And Troy's reprieve thenceforth is at an end. Go—take refreshment now that we may march Forth to our enemies. Let each whet well His spear, brace well his shield, well feed his brisk High-mettled horses, well survey and search His chariot on all sides, that no defect Disgrace his bright habiliments of war. So will we give the day from morn to eve To dreadful battle. Pause there shall be none Till night divide us. Every buckler's thong Shall sweat on the toil'd bosom, every hand That shakes the spear shall ache, and every steed Shall smoke that whirls the chariot o'er the plain. Woe then to whom I shall discover here Loitering among the tents; let him escape My vengeance if he can. The vultures' maw Shall have his carcase, and the dogs his bones. He spake; whom all applauded with a shout Loud as against some headland cliff the waves Roll'd by the stormy South o'er rocks that shoot Afar into the deep, which in all winds The flood still overspreads, blow whence they may. Arising, forth they rush'd, among the ships All scatter'd; smoke from every tent arose, The host their food preparing; next, his God Each man invoked (of the Immortals him Whom he preferr'd) with sacrifice and prayer For safe escape from danger and from death. But Agamemnon to Saturnian Jove Omnipotent, an ox of the fifth year Full-flesh'd devoted, and the Princes call'd Noblest of all the Greecians to his feast. First, Nestor with Idomeneus the King, Then either Ajax, and the son he call'd Of Tydeus, with Ulysses sixth and last, Jove's peer in wisdom. Menelaus went, Heroic Chief! unbidden, for he knew His brother's mind with weight of care oppress'd. The ox encircling, and their hands with meal Of consecration fill'd, the assembly stood, When Agamemnon thus his prayer preferred. Almighty Father! Glorious above all! Cloud-girt, who dwell'st in heaven thy throne sublime, Let not the sun go down, till Priam's roof Fall flat into the flames; till I shall burn His gates with fire; till I shall hew away His hack'd and riven corslet from the breast Of Hector, and till numerous Chiefs, his friends, Around him, prone in dust, shall bite the ground. So prayed he, but with none effect. The God Received his offering, but to double toil Doom'd them, and sorrow more than all the past. They then, the triturated barley grain, First duly sprinkling, the sharp steel infix'd Deep in the victim's neck reversed, then stripp'd The carcase, and divided at their joint The thighs, which in the double cawl involved They spread with slices crude, and burn'd with fire Ascending fierce from billets sere and dry. The spitted entrails next they o'er the coals Suspended held. The thighs with fire consumed, They gave to each his portion of the maw, Then slash'd the remnant, pierced it with the spits, And managing with culinary skill The roast, withdrew it from the spits again. Thus, all their task accomplish'd, and the board Set forth, they feasted, and were all sufficed. When neither hunger more nor thirst remain'd Unsatisfied, Gerenian Nestor spake. Atrides! Agamemnon! King of men! No longer waste we time in useless words, Nor to a distant hour postpone the work To which heaven calls thee. Send thine heralds forth. Who shall convene the Achaians at the fleet, That we, the Chiefs assembled here, may range, Together, the imbattled multitude, And edge their spirits for immediate fight. He spake, nor Agamemnon not complied. At once he bade his clear-voiced heralds call The Greeks to battle. They the summons loud Gave forth, and at the sound the people throng'd. Then Agamemnon and the Kings of Greece Dispatchful drew them into order just, With whom Minerva azure-eyed advanced, The inestimable Ægis on her arm, Immortal, unobnoxious to decay. An hundred braids, close twisted, all of gold, Each valued at an hundred beeves Money stamped with the figure of an ox., around Dependent fringed it. She from side to side Her eyes cærulean rolled, infusing thirst Of battle endless into every breast. War won them now, war sweeter now to each Than gales to waft them over ocean home. As when devouring flames some forest seize On the high mountains, splendid from afar The blaze appears, so, moving on the plain, The steel-clad host innumerous flash'd to heaven. And as a multitude of fowls in flocks Assembled various, geese, or cranes, or swans Lithe-neck'd, long hovering o'er Caÿster's banks On wanton plumes, successive on the mead Alight at last, and with a clang so loud That all the hollow vale of Asius rings; In number such from ships and tents effused, They cover'd the Scamandrian plain; the earth Rebellow'd to the feet of steeds and men. They overspread Scamander's grassy vale, Myriads, as leaves, or as the flowers of spring. As in the hovel where the peasant milks His kine in spring-time, when his pails are fil'ld, Thick clouds of humming insects on the wing Swarm all around him, so the Grecians swarm'd An unsumm'd multitude o'er all the plain, Bright arm'd, high crested, and athirst for war. As goat-herds separate their numerous flocks With ease, though fed promiscuous, with like ease Their leaders them on every side reduced To martial order glorious; among whom Stood Agamemnon “with an eye like Jove's, To threaten or command,” like Mars in girth, And with the port of Neptune. As the bull Conspicuous among all the herd appears, For He surpasses all, such Jove ordain'd That day the son of Atreus, in the midst Of Heroes, eminent above them all. Tell me, (for ye are heavenly, and beheld A scene, whereof the faint report alone Hath reached our ears, remote and ill-informed,) Tell me, ye Muses, under whom, beneath What Chiefs of royal or of humbler note Stood forth the embattled Greeks? The host at large; They were a multitude in number more Then with ten tongues, and with ten mouths, each mouth Made vocal with a trumpet's throat of brass, I might declare, unless the Olympian nine, Jove's daughters, would the chronicle themselves Indite, of all assembled, under Troy. I will rehearse the Captains and their fleets. Bœotia's sturdy sons Peneleus led, And Leïtus, whose partners in command Arcesilaus and Prothoenor came, And Clonius. Them the dwellers on the rocks Of Aulis followed, with the hardy clans Of Hyrie, Schoenos, Scholos, and the hills Of Eteon; Thespia, Græa, and the plains Of Mycalessus them, and Harma served, Eleon, Erythræ, Peteon; Hyle them, Ilesius and Ocalea, and the strength Of Medeon; Copæ also in their train Marched, with Eutresis and the mighty men Of Thisbe famed for doves; nor pass unnamed Whom Coronæa, and the grassy land Of Haliartus added to the war, Nor whom Platæa, nor whom Glissa bred, And Hypothebæ Some say Thebes the less, others, the suburbs of Thebes the greater. It is certain that Thebes itself sent none., and thy sacred groves To Neptune, dark Onchestus. Arne claims A record next for her illustrious sons, Vine-bearing Arne. Thou wast also there Mideia, and thou Nissa; nor be thine Though last, Anthedon, a forgotten name. These in Bœotia's fair and gallant fleet Of fifty ships, each bearing o'er the waves Thrice forty warriors, had arrived at Troy. In thirty ships deep-laden with the brave, Aspledon and Orchomenos had sent Their chosen youth; them ruled a noble pair, Sons of Astyoche; she, lovely nymph, Received by stealth, on Actor's stately roof, The embraces of a God, and bore to Mars Twins like himself, Ascalaphus the bold, And bold Iälmenus, expert in arms. Beneath Epistrophus and Schedius, took Their destined station on Bœotia's left, The brave Phocensians; they in forty ships From Cyparissus came, and from the rocks Of Python, and from Crissa the divine; From Anemoria, Daulis, Panopeus, And from Hyampolis, and from the banks Of the Cephissus, sacred stream, and from Lilæa, seated at its fountain-head. Next from beyond Eubœa's happy isle In forty ships conveyed, stood forth well armed The Locrians; dwellers in Augeia some The pleasant, some of Opoëis possessed, Some of Calliarus; these Scarpha sent, And Cynus those; from Bessa came the rest, From Tarpha, Thronius, and from the brink Of loud Boagrius; Ajax them, the swift, Son of Oileus led, not such as he From Telamon, big-boned and lofty built, But small of limb, and of an humbler crest; Yet he, competitor had none throughout The Grecians of what land soe'er, for skill In ushering to its mark the rapid lance. Elphenor brought (Calchodon's mighty son) The Eubœans to the field. In forty ships From Histriæa for her vintage famed, From Chalcis, from Iretria, from the gates Of maritime Cerinthus, from the heights Of Dios rock-built citadel sublime, And from Caristus and from Styra came His warlike multitudes, all named alike Abantes, on whose shoulders fell behind Their locks profuse, and they were eager all To split the hauberk with the pointed spear. Nor Athens had withheld her generous sons, The people of Erectheus. Him of old The teeming glebe produced, a wonderous birth! And Pallas rear'd him: her own unctuous fane She made his habitation, where with bulls The youth of Athens, and with slaughter'd lambs Her annual worship celebrate. Them led Menestheus, whom, (sage Nestor's self except, Thrice school'd in all events of human life,) None rivall'd ever in the just array Of horse and man to battle. Fifty ships Black-prowed, had borne them to the distant war. Ajax from Salamis twelve vessels brought, And where the Athenian band in phalanx stood Marshall'd compact, there station'd he his powers. The men of Argos and Tyrintha next, And of Hermione, that stands retired With Asine, within her spacious bay; Of Epidaurus, crown'd with purple vines, And of Trœzena, with the Achaian youth Of sea-begirt Ægina, and with thine, Maseta, and the dwellers on thy coast, Wave-worn Eïonæ; these all obeyed The dauntless Hero Diomede, whom served Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, a Chief Of deathless fame, his second in command, And Godlike man, Euryalus, the son Of King Mecisteus, Talaüs' son, his third. But Diomede controll'd them all, and him Twice forty sable ships their leader own'd. Came Agamemnon with a hundred ships, Exulting in his powers; more numerous they, And more illustrious far than other Chief Could boast, whoever. Clad in burnish'd brass, And conscious of pre-eminence, he stood. He drew his host from cities far renown'd, Mycenæ, and Corinthus, seat of wealth, Orneia, and Cleonæ bulwark'd strong, And lovely Aræthyria; Sicyon, where His seat of royal power held at the first Adrastus: Hyperesia, and the heights Of Gonoëssa; Ægium, with the towns That sprinkle all that far-extended coast, Pellene also and wide Helice With all their shores, were number'd in his train. From hollow Lacedæmon's glen profound, From Phare, Sparta, and from Messa, still Resounding with the ring-dove's amorous moan, From Brysia, from Augeia, from the rocks Of Laas, from Amycla, Otilus, And from the towers of Helos, at whose foot The surf of Ocean falls, came sixty barks With Menelaus. From the monarch's host The royal brother ranged his own apart, And panted for revenge of Helen's wrongs, And of her sighs and tears. From rank to rank, Conscious of dauntless might he pass'd, and sent Into all hearts the fervour of his own. Gerenian Nestor in thrice thirty ships Had brought his warriors; they from Pylus came, From blythe Arene, and from Thryos, built Fast by the fords of Alpheus, and from steep And stately Æpy. Their confederate powers Sent Amphigenia, Cyparissa veiled With broad redundance of funereal shades, Pteleos and Helos, and of deathless fame Dorion. In Dorion erst the Muses met Threïcian Thamyris, on his return From Eurytus, Oechalian Chief, and hush'd His song for ever; for he dared to vaunt That he would pass in song even themselves The Muses, daughters of Jove Ægis-arm'd. They, therefore, by his boast incensed, the bard Struck blind, and from his memory dash'd severe All traces of his once celestial strains. Arcadia's sons, the dwellers at the foot Of mount Cyllene, where Æpytus sleeps Intomb'd; a generation bold in fight, And warriors hand to hand; the valiant men Of Pheneus, of Orchomenos by flocks Grazed numberless, of Ripe, Stratia, bleak Enispe; Mantinea city fair, Stymphelus and Parrhasia, and the youth Of Tegea; royal Agapenor these, Ancæus' offspring, had in sixty ships To Troy conducted; numerous was the crew, And skilled in arms, which every vessel brought, And Agamemnon had with barks himself Supplied them, for, of inland realms possessed, They little heeded maritime employs. The dwellers in Buprasium, on the shores Of pleasant Elis, and in all the land Myrsinus and the Hyrminian plain between, The rock Olenian, and the Alysian fount; These all obey'd four Chiefs, and galleys ten Each Chief commanded, with Epeans filled. Amphimachus and Thalpius govern'd these, This, son of Cteatus, the other, sprung From Eurytus, and both of Actor's house. Diores, son of Amarynceus, those Led on, and, for his godlike form renown'd, Polyxenus was Chieftain o'er the rest, Son of Agasthenes, Augeias' son. Dulichium, and her sister sacred isles The Echinades, whose opposite aspect Looks toward Elis o'er the curling waves, Sent forth their powers with Meges at their head, Brave son of Phyleus, warrior dear to Jove. Phyleus in wrath, his father's house renounced, And to Dulichium wandering, there abode. Twice twenty ships had follow'd Meges forth. Ulysses led the Cephallenians bold. From Ithaca, and from the lofty woods Of Neritus they came, and from the rocks Of rude Ægilipa. Crocylia these, And those Zacynthus own'd; nor yet a few From Samos, from Epirus join'd their aid, And from the opposite Ionian shore. Them, wise as Jove himself, Ulysses led In twelve fair ships, with crimson prows adorn'd. From forty ships, Thoas, Andræmon's son, Had landed his Ætolians; for extinct Was Meleager, and extinct the house Of Oeneus all, nor Oeneus self survived; To Thoas therefore had Ætolia fallen; Him Olenos, Pylene, Chalcis served, With Pleuro, and the rock-bound Calydon. Idomeneus, spear-practised warrior, led The numerous Cretans. In twice forty ships He brought his powers to Troy. The warlike bands Of Cnossus, of Gortyna wall'd around, Of Lyctus, of Lycastus chalky-white, Of Phæstus, of Miletus, with the youth Of Rhytius him obeyed; nor these were all, But others from her hundred cities Crete Sent forth, all whom Idomeneus the brave Commanded, with Meriones in arms Dread as the God of battles blood-imbrued. Nine ships Tlepolemus, Herculean-born, For courage famed and for superior size, Fill'd with his haughty Rhodians. They, in tribes Divided, dwelt distinct. Jelyssus these, Those Lindus, and the rest the shining soil Of white Camirus occupied. Him bore To Hercules, (what time he led the nymph From Ephyre, and from Sellea's banks, After full many a city laid in dust,) Astyocheia. In his father's house Magnificent, Tlepolemus spear-famed Had scarce up-grown to manhood's lusty prime, When he his father's hoary uncle slew Lycimnius, branch of Mars. Then built he ships, And, pushing forth to sea, fled from the threats Of the whole house of Hercules. Huge toil And many woes he suffer'd, till at length At Rhodes arriving, in three separate bands He spread himself abroad. Much was he loved Of all-commanding Jove, who bless'd him there, And shower'd abundant riches on them all. Nireus of Syma, with three vessels came; Nireus, Aglæa's offspring, whom she bore To Charopus the King; Nireus in form, (The faultless son of Peleus sole except,) Loveliest of all the Grecians call'd to Troy. But he was heartless and his men were few. Nisyrus, Casus, Crapathus, and Cos Where reign'd Eurypylus, with all the isles Calydnæ named, under two valiant Chiefs Their troops disposed; Phidippus one, and one, His brother Antiphus, begotten both By Thessalus, whom Hercules begat. In thirty ships they sought the shores of Troy. The warriors of Pelasgian Argos next, Of Alus, and Alope, and who held Trechina, Phthia, and for women fair Distinguish'd, Hellas; known by various names Hellenes, Myrmidons, Achæans, them In fifty ships embark'd, Achilles ruled. But these were deaf to the hoarse-throated war, For there was none to draw their battle forth, And give them just array. Close in his ships Achilles, after loss of the bright-hair'd Brisëis, lay, resentful; her obtained Not without labour hard, and after sack Of Thebes and of Lyrnessus, where he slew Two mighty Chiefs, sons of Evenus both, Epistrophus and Mynes, her he mourn'd, And for her sake self-prison'd in his fleet And idle lay, though soon to rise again. From Phylace, and from the flowery fields Of Pyrrhasus, a land to Ceres given By consecration, and from Iton green, Mother of flocks; from Antron by the sea, And from the grassy meads of Pteleus, came A people, whom while yet he lived, the brave Protesilaüs led; but him the earth Now cover'd dark and drear. A wife he left, To rend in Phylace her bleeding cheeks, And an unfinish'd mansion. First he died Of all the Greeks; for as he leap'd to land Foremost by far, a Dardan struck him dead. Nor had his troops, though filled with deep regret, No leader; them Podarces led, a Chief Like Mars in battle, brother of the slain, But younger born, and from Iphiclus sprung Who sprang from Phylacus the rich in flocks. But him Protesilaüs, as in years, So also in desert of arms excell'd Heroic, whom his host, although they saw Podarces at their head, still justly mourn'd; For he was fierce in battle, and at Troy With forty sable-sided ships arrived. Eleven galleys, Pheræ on the lake, And Boebe, and Iölchus, and the vale Of Glaphyræ supplied with crews robust Under Eumelus; him Alcestis, praised For beauty above all her sisters fair, In Thessaly to King Admetus bore. Methone, and Olizon's craggy coast, With Melibœa and Thaumasia sent Seven ships; their rowers were good archers all, And every vessel dipped into the wave Her fifty oars. Them Philoctetes, skill'd To draw with sinewy arm the stubborn bow, Commanded; but he suffering anguish keen Inflicted by a serpent's venom'd tooth, Lay sick in Lemnos; him the Grecians there Had left sore-wounded, but were destined soon To call to dear remembrance whom they left. Meantime, though sorrowing for his sake, his troops Yet wanted not a Chief; them Medon ruled, Whom Rhena to the far-famed conqueror bore Oïleus, fruit of their unsanction'd loves. From Tricca, from Ithome rough and rude With rocks and glens, and from Oechalia, town Of Eurytus Oechalian-born, came forth Their warlike youth by Podalirius led And by Machaon, healers both expert Of all disease, and thirty ships were theirs. The men of Ormenus, and from beside The fountain Hypereia, from the tops Of chalky Titan, and Asteria's band; Them ruled Eurypylus, Evæmon's son Illustrious, whom twice twenty ships obeyed. Orthe, Gyrtone, Oloösson white, Argissa and Helone; they their youth Gave to control of Polypœtes, son Undaunted of Pirithoüs, son of Jove. Him, to Pirithoüs, (on the self-same day, When he the Centaurs punish'd and pursued Sheer to Æthicæ driven from Pelion's heights The shaggy race) Hippodamia bore. Nor he alone them led. With him was join'd Leonteus dauntless warrior, from the bold Coronus sprung, who Cæneus call'd his sire. Twice twenty ships awaited their command. Guneus from Cyphus twenty and two ships Led forth; the Enienes him obey'd, And the robust Perœbi, warriors bold, And dwellers on Dodona's wintry brow. To these were join'd who till the pleasant fields Where Titaresius winds; the gentle flood Pours into Peneus all his limpid stores, But with the silver-eddied Peneus flows Unmixt as oil; for Stygian is his stream, And Styx is the inviolable oath. Last with his forty ships, Tenthredon's son, The active Prothoüs came. From the green banks Of Peneus his Magnesians far and near He gather'd, and from Pelion forest-crown'd. These were the princes and the Chiefs of Greece. Say, Muse, who most in personal desert Excell'd, and whose were the most warlike steeds And of the noblest strain. Their hue, their age, Their height the same, swift as the winds of heaven And passing far all others, were the mares Which drew Eumelus; on Pierian hills The heavenly Archer of the silver bow, Apollo, bred them. But of men, the chief Was Telamonian Ajax, while wrath-bound Achilles lay; for he was worthier far, And more illustrious were the steeds which bore The noble son of Peleus; but revenge On Agamemnon leader of the host Was all his thought, while in his gallant ships Sharp-keel'd to cut the foaming flood, he lay. Meantime, along the margin of the deep His soldiers hurled the disk, or bent the bow, Or to its mark dispatch'd the quivering lance. Beside the chariots stood the unharness'd steeds Cropping the lotus, or at leisure browzed On celery wild, from watery freshes gleaned. Beneath the shadow of the sheltering tent The chariot stood, while they, the charioteers Roam'd here and there the camp, their warlike lord Regretting sad, and idle for his sake. As if a fire had burnt along the ground, Such seem'd their march; earth groan'd their steps beneath; As when in Arimi, where fame reports Typhoëus stretch'd, the fires of angry Jove Down darted, lash the ground, so groan'd the earth Beneath them, for they traversed swift the plain. And now from Jove, with heavy tidings charged, Wind-footed Iris to the Trojans came. It was the time of council, when the throng At Priam's gate assembled, young and old: Them, standing nigh, the messenger of heaven Accosted with the voice of Priam's son, Polites. He, confiding in his speed For sure deliverance, posted was abroad On Æsyeta's tomb, intent to watch When the Achaian host should leave the fleet. The Goddess in his form thus them address'd. Oh, ancient Monarch! Ever, evermore Speaking, debating, as if all were peace: I have seen many a bright-embattled field, But never one so throng'd as this to-day. For like the leaves, or like the sands they come Swept by the winds, to gird the city round. But Hector! chiefly thee I shall exhort. In Priam's spacious city are allies Collected numerous, and of nations wide- Disseminated various are the tongues. Let every Chief his proper troop command, And marshal his own citizens to war. She ceased; her Hector heard intelligent, And quick dissolved the council. All took arms. Wide flew the gates; forth rush'd the multitude, Horsemen and foot, and boisterous stir arose. In front of Ilium, distant on the plain, Clear all around from all obstruction, stands An eminence high-raised, by mortal men Call'd Batiea, but the Gods the tomb Have named it of Myrinna swift in fight. Troy and her aids there set the battle forth. Huge Priameian Hector, fierce in arms, Led on the Trojans; with whom march'd the most And the most valiant, dexterous at the spear. Æneas, (on the hills of Ida him The lovely Venus to Anchises bore, A Goddess by a mortal man embraced) Led the Dardanians; but not he alone; Archilochus with him and Acamas Stood forth, the offspring of Antenor, each, And well instructed in all forms of war. Fast by the foot of Ida, where they drank The limpid waters of Æsepus, dwelt, The Trojans of Zeleia. Rich were they And led by Pandarus, Lycaon's son. Whom Phœbus self graced with the bow he bore. Apæsus, Adrastea, Terie steep, And Pitueia—them, Amphius clad In mail thick-woven, and Adrastus, ruled. They were the sons of the Percosian seer Merops, expert in the sooth-sayers' art Above all other; he his sons forbad The bloody fight, but disobedient they Still sought it, for their destiny prevailed. The warriors of Percote, and who dwelt In Practius, in Arisba, city fair, In Sestus, in Abydus, march'd behind Princely Hyrtacides; his tawny steeds, Strong-built and tall, from Selleentes' bank And from Arisba, had him borne to Troy. Hippothous and Pilæus, branch of Mars, Both sons of Lethus the Pelasgian, they, Forth from Larissa for her fertile soil Far-famed, the spear-expert Pelasgians brought. The Thracians (all whom Hellespont includes Within the banks of his swift-racing tide) Heroic Acamas and Pirous led. Euphemus, offspring of Trœzenus, son Of Jove-protected Ceas, was the Chief Whom the spear-arm'd Ciconian band obey'd. Pæonia's archer's follow'd to the field Pyræchmes; they from Amydon remote Were drawn, where Axius winds; broad Axius, stream Diffused delightful over all the vale. Pylæmenes, a Chief of giant might From the Eneti for forest-mules renowned March'd with his Paphlagonians; dwellers they In Sesamus and in Cytorus were, And by the stream Parthenius; Cromna these Sent forth, and those Ægialus on the lip And margin of the land, and some, the heights Of Erythini, rugged and abrupt. Epistrophus and Odius from the land Of Alybe, a region far remote, Where veins of silver wind, led to the field The Halizonians. With the Mysians came Chromis their Chief, and Ennomus; him skill'd In augury, but skill'd in vain, his art Saved not, but by Æacides the swift, With others in the Xanthus slain, he died. Ascanius, lovely youth, and Phorcis, led The Phrygians from Ascania far remote, Ardent for battle. The Mœonian race, (All those who at the foot of Tmolus dwelt,) Mesthles and Antiphus, fraternal pair, Sons of Pylæmenes commanded, both Of the Gygæan lake in Lydia born. Amphimachus and Nastes led to fight The Carians, people of a barbarous speech, With the Milesians, and the mountain-race Of wood-crown'd Phthira, and who dwelt beside Mæander, or on Mycale sublime. Them led Amphimachus and Nastes, sons Renown'd of Nomion. Like a simple girl Came forth Amphimachus with gold bedight, But him his trappings from a woeful death Saved not, when whirled beneath the bloody tide To Peleus' stormy son his spoils he left. Sarpedon with the noble Glaucus led Their warriors forth from farthest Lycia, where Xanthus deep-dimpled rolls his oozy tide. BOOK III. ARGUMENT OF THE THIRD BOOK. The armies meet. Paris throws out a challenge to the Greecian Princes. Menelaus accepts it. The terms of the combat are adjusted solemnly by Agamemnon on the part of Greece, and by Priam on the part of Troy. The combat ensues, in which Paris is vanquished, whom yet Venus rescues. Agamemnon demands from the Trojans a performance of the covenant. Now marshall'd all beneath their several chiefs, With deafening shouts, and with the clang of arms, The host of Troy advanced. Such clang is heard Along the skies, when from incessant showers Escaping, and from winter's cold, the cranes Take wing, and over Ocean speed away; Woe to the land of dwarfs! prepared, they fly For slaughter of the small Pygmæan race. Not so the Greeks; they breathing valour came, But silent all, and all with faithful hearts On succour mutual to the last, resolved. As when the south wind wraps the mountain top In mist the shepherd's dread, but to the thief Than night itself more welcome, and the eye Is bounded in its ken to a stone's cast, Such from beneath their footsteps dun and dense Uprose the dust, for swift they cross the plain. When, host to host opposed, full nigh they stood, Then Alexander Paris, frequently named Alexander in the original. in the Trojan van Advanced was seen, all beauteous as a God; His leopard's skin, his falchion and his bow Hung from his shoulder; bright with heads of brass He shook two spears, and challenged to the fight The bravest Argives there, defying all. Him, striding haughtily his host before When Menelaus saw, such joy he felt As hunger-pinch'd the lion feels, by chance Conducted to some carcase huge, wild goat, Or antler'd stag; huntsmen and baying hounds Disturb not him, he gorges in their sight. So Menelaus at the view rejoiced Of lovely Alexander, for he hoped His punishment at hand. At once, all armed, Down from his chariot to the ground he leap'd. When Godlike Paris him in front beheld Conspicuous, his heart smote him, and his fate Avoiding, far within the lines he shrank. As one, who in some woodland height descrying A serpent huge, with sudden start recoils, His limbs shake under him; with cautious step He slow retires; fear blanches cold his cheeks; So beauteous Alexander at the sight Of Atreus' son dishearten'd sore, the ranks Of haughty Trojans enter'd deep again: Him Hector eyed, and thus rebuked severe. Curst Paris! Fair deceiver! Woman-mad! I would to all in heaven that thou hadst died Unborn, at least unmated! happier far Than here to have incurr'd this public shame! Well may the Greecians taunt, and laughing loud, Applaud the champion, slow indeed to fight And pusillanimous, but wonderous fair. Wast thou as timid, tell me, when with those Thy loved companions in that famed exploit, Thou didst consort with strangers, and convey From distant lands a warrior's beauteous bride To be thy father's and his people's curse, Joy to our foes, but to thyself reproach? Behold her husband! Darest thou not to face The warlike prince? Now learn how brave a Chief Thou hast defrauded of his blooming spouse. Thy lyre, thy locks, thy person, specious gifts Of partial Venus, will avail thee nought, Once mixt by Menelaus with the dust. But we are base ourselves, or long ago, For all thy numerous mischiefs, thou hadst slept Secure beneath a coverlet ?????? ???? ??????. of stone Then Godlike Alexander thus replied. Oh Hector, true in temper as the axe Which in the shipwright's hand the naval plank Divides resistless, doubling all his force, Such is thy dauntless spirit, whose reproach Perforce I own, nor causeless nor unjust. Yet let the gracious gifts uncensured pass Of golden Venus; man may not reject The glorious bounty by the Gods bestow'd, Nor follows their beneficence our choice. But if thy pleasure be that I engage With Menelaus in decision fierce Of desperate combat, bid the host of Troy And bid the Greecians sit; then face to face Commit us, in the vacant field between, To fight for Helen and for all her wealth. Who strongest proves, and conquers, he, of her And her's possess'd, shall bear them safe away; While ye (peace sworn and firm accord) shall dwell At Troy, and these to Argos shall return And to Achaia praised for women fair. He ceased, whom Hector heard with joy; he moved Into the middle space, and with his spear Advanced athwart push'd back the Trojan van, And all stood fast. Meantime at him the Greeks Discharged full volley, showering thick around From bow and sling; when with a mighty voice Thus Agamemnon, leader of the host. Argives! Be still—shoot not, ye sons of Greece! Hector bespeaks attention. Hear the Chief! He said, at once the Greecians ceased to shoot, And all sat silent. Hector then began. Hear me, ye Trojans, and ye Greeks mail-arm'd, While I shall publish in your ears the words Of Alexander, author of our strife. Trojans, he bids, and Greecians on the field Their arms dispose; while he, the hosts between, With warlike Menelaus shall in fight Contend for Helen, and for all her wealth. Who strongest proves, and conquers, he, of her And her's possest, shall bear them safe away, And oaths of amity shall bind the rest He ceased, and all deep silence held, amazed; When valiant Menelaus thus began. Hear now me also, on whose aching heart These woes have heaviest fallen. At last I hope Decision near, Trojans and Greeks between, For ye have suffer'd in my quarrel much, And much by Paris, author of the war. Die he who must, and peace be to the rest. But ye shall hither bring two lambs, one white, The other black; this to the Earth devote, That to the Sun. We shall ourselves supply A third for Jove. Then bring ye Priam forth, Himself to swear the covenant, (for his sons Are faithless) lest the oath of Jove be scorn'd. Young men are ever of unstable mind; But when an elder interferes, he views Future and past together, and insures The compact, to both parties, uninfringed. So Menelaus spake; and in all hearts Awaken'd joyful hope that there should end War's long calamities. Alighted each, And drew his steeds into the lines. The field Glitter'd with arms put off, and side by side, Ranged orderly, while the interrupted war Stood front to front, small interval between. Then Hector to the city sent in haste Two heralds for the lambs, and to invite Priam; while Agamemnon, royal Chief, Talthybius to the Greecian fleet dismiss'd For a third lamb to Jove; nor he the voice Of noble Agamemnon disobey'd. Iris, ambassadress of heaven, the while, To Helen came. Laodice she seem'd, Loveliest of all the daughters of the house Of Priam, wedded to Antenor's son, King Helicaon. Her she found within. An ample web magnificent she wove, Inwrought with numerous conflicts for her sake Beneath the hands of Mars endured by Greeks Mail-arm'd, and Trojans of equestrian fame. Swift Iris, at her side, her thus address'd. Haste, dearest nymph! a wonderous sight behold! Greeks brazen-mail'd, and Trojans steed-renown'd, So lately on the cruel work of Mars Intent and hot for mutual havoc, sit Silent; the war hath paused, and on his shield Each leans, his long spear planted at his side. Paris and Menelaus, warrior bold, With quivering lances shall contend for thee, And thou art his who conquers; his for ever. So saying, the Goddess into Helen's soul Sweetest desire infused to see again Her former Lord, her parents, and her home. At once o'ermantled with her snowy veil She started forth, and as she went, let fall A tender tear; not unaccompanied She went, but by two maidens of her train Attended, Æthra, Pittheus' daughter fair, And soft-eyed Clymene. Their hasty steps Convey'd them quickly to the Scæan gate. There Priam, Panthoüs, Clytius, Lampus sat, Thymoetes, Hicetaon, branch of Mars, Antenor and Ucalegon the wise, All, elders of the people; warriors erst, But idle now through age, yet of a voice Still indefatigable as the fly's Not the grasshopper, but an insect well known in hot countries, and which in Italy is called Cicála. The Grasshopper rests on the ground, but the favourite abode of the Cicála is in the trees and hedges. Which perch'd among the boughs sends forth at noon Through all the grove his slender ditty sweet. Such sat those Trojan leaders on the tower, Who, soon as Helen on the steps they saw, In accents quick, but whisper'd, thus remark'd. Trojans and Greecians wage, with fair excuse, Long war for so much beauty. Oh, how like In feature to the Goddesses above! Pernicious loveliness! Ah, hence away, Resistless as thou art and all divine, Nor leave a curse to us, and to our sons. So they among themselves; but Priam call'd Fair Helen to his side. My daughter dear! Come, sit beside me. Thou shalt hence discern Thy former Lord, thy kindred and thy friends. I charge no blame on thee. The Gods have caused, Not thou, this lamentable war to Troy. Name to me yon Achaian Chief for bulk Conspicuous, and for port. Taller indeed I may perceive than he; but with these eyes Saw never yet such dignity, and grace. Declare his name. Some royal Chief he seems. To whom thus Helen, loveliest of her sex. My other Sire! by me for ever held In reverence, and with filial fear beloved! Oh that some cruel death had been my choice, Rather than to abandon, as I did, All joys domestic, matrimonial bliss, Brethren, dear daughter, and companions dear, A wanderer with thy son. Yet I alas! Died not, and therefore now, live but to weep. But I resolve thee. Thou behold'st the son Of Atreus, Agamemnon, mighty king, In arms heroic, gracious in the throne, And, (though it shame me now to call him such,) By nuptial ties a brother once to me. Then him the ancient King admiring, said. Oh blest Atrides, happy was thy birth, And thy lot glorious, whom this gallant host So numerous, of the sons of Greece obey! To vine-famed Phrygia, in my days of youth, I journey'd; many Phrygians there I saw, Brave horsemen, and expert; they were the powers Of Otreus and of Mygdon, Godlike Chief, And on the banks of Sangar's stream encamp'd. I march'd among them, chosen in that war Ally of Phrygia, and it was her day Of conflict with the man-defying race, The Amazons; yet multitudes like these Thy bright-eyed Greeks, I saw not even there. The venerable King observing next Ulysses, thus enquired. My child, declare Him also. Shorter by the head he seems Than Agamemnon, Atreus' mighty son, But shoulder'd broader, and of ampler chest; He hath disposed his armour on the plain, But like a ram, himself the warrior ranks Ranges majestic; like a ram full-fleeced By numerous sheep encompass'd snowy-white. To whom Jove's daughter Helen thus replied. In him the son of old Laertes know, Ulysses; born in Ithaca the rude, But of a piercing wit, and deeply wise. Then answer thus, Antenor sage return'd. Princess thou hast described him: hither once The noble Ithacan, on thy behalf Embassador with Menelaus, came: Beneath my roof, with hospitable fare Friendly I entertained them. Seeing then Occasion opportune, I closely mark'd The genius and the talents of the Chiefs, And this I noted well; that when they stood Amid the assembled counsellors of Troy, Then Menelaus his advantage show'd, Who by the shoulders overtopp'd his friend. But when both sat, Ulysses in his air Had more of state and dignity than he. In the delivery of a speech address'd To the full senate, Menelaus used Few words, but to the matter, fitly ranged, And with much sweetness utter'd; for in loose And idle play of ostentatious terms He dealt not, though he were the younger man. But when the wise Ulysses from his seat Had once arisen, he would his downcast eyes So rivet on the earth, and with a hand That seem'd untutor'd in its use, so hold His sceptre, swaying it to neither side, That hadst thou seen him, thou hadst thought him, sure, Some chafed and angry idiot, passion-fixt. Yet, when at length, the clear and mellow base Of his deep voice brake forth, and he let fall His chosen words like flakes of feather'd snow, None then might match Ulysses; leisure, then, Found none to wonder at his noble form. The third of whom the venerable king Enquired, was Ajax.—Yon Achaian tall, Whose head and shoulders tower above the rest, And of such bulk prodigious—who is he? Him answer'd Helen, loveliest of her sex. A bulwark of the Greeks. In him thou seest Gigantic Ajax. Opposite appear The Cretans, and among the Chiefs of Crete Stands, like a God, Idomeneus. Him oft From Crete arrived, was Menelaus wont To entertain; and others now I see, Achaians, whom I could recall to mind, And give to each his name; but two brave youths I yet discern not; for equestrian skill One famed, and one a boxer never foiled; My brothers; born of Leda; sons of Jove; Castor and Pollux. Either they abide In lovely Sparta still, or if they came, Decline the fight, by my disgrace abash'd, And the reproaches which have fallen on me. She said; but they already slept inhumed In Lacedemon, in their native soil. And now the heralds, through the streets of Troy Charged with the lambs, and with a goat-skin filled With heart-exhilarating wine prepared For that divine solemnity, return'd. Idæus in his hand a beaker bore Resplendent, with its fellow cups of gold, And thus he summon'd ancient Priam forth. Son of Laomedon, arise. The Chiefs Call thee, the Chiefs of Ilium and of Greece. Descend into the plain. We strike a truce, And need thine oath to bind it. Paris fights With warlike Menelaus for his spouse; Their spears decide the strife. The conqueror wins Helen and all her treasures. We, thenceforth, (Peace sworn and amity,) shall dwell secure In Troy, while they to Argos shall return And to Achaia praised for women fair. He spake, and Priam, shuddering, bade his train Prepare his steeds; they sedulous obey'd. First, Priam mounting, backward stretch'd the reins; Antenor, next, beside him sat, and through The Scæan gate they drove into the plain. Arriving at the hosts of Greece and Troy They left the chariot, and proceeded both Into the interval between the hosts. Then uprose Agamemnon, and uprose All-wise Ulysses. Next, the heralds came Conspicuous forward, expediting each The ceremonial; they the beaker fill'd With wine, and to the hands of all the kings Minister'd water. Agamemnon then Drawing his dagger which he ever bore Appendant to his heavy falchion's sheath, Cut off the forelocks of the lambs, of which The heralds gave to every Greecian Chief A portion, and to all the Chiefs of Troy. Then Agamemnon raised his hands, and pray'd. Jove, Father, who from Ida stretchest forth Thine arm omnipotent, o'erruling all, And thou, all-seeing and all-hearing sun, Ye rivers, and thou conscious earth, and ye Who under earth on human kind avenge Severe, the guilt of violated oaths, Hear ye, and ratify what now we swear! Should Paris slay the hero amber-hair'd, My brother Menelaus, Helen's wealth And Helen's self are his, and all our host Shall home return to Greece; but should it chance That Paris fall by Menelaus' hand, Then Troy shall render back what she detains, With such amercement as is meet, a sum To be remember'd in all future times. Which penalty should Priam and his sons Not pay, though Paris fall, then here in arms I will contend for payment of the mulct My due, till, satisfied, I close the war. He said, and with his ruthless steel the lambs Stretch'd panting all, but soon they ceased to pant, For mortal was the stroke. Then drawing forth Wine from the beaker, they with brimming cups Hail'd the immortal Gods, and pray'd again, And many a Greecian thus and Trojan spake. All-glorious Jove, and ye the powers of heaven, Whoso shall violate this contract first, So be the brains of them and of their sons Pour'd out, as we this wine pour on the earth, And may their wives bring forth to other men! So they: but them Jove heard not. Then arose Priam, the son of Dardanus, and said, Hear me, ye Trojans and ye Greeks well-arm'd. Hence back to wind-swept Ilium I return, Unable to sustain the sight, my son With warlike Menelaus match'd in arms. Jove knows, and the immortal Gods, to whom Of both, this day is preordain'd the last. So spake the godlike monarch, and disposed Within the royal chariot all the lambs; Then, mounting, check'd the reins; Antenor next Ascended, and to Ilium both return'd. First, Hector and Ulysses, noble Chief, Measured the ground; then taking lots for proof Who of the combatants should foremost hurl His spear, they shook them in a brazen casque; Meantime the people raised their hands on high, And many a Greecian thus and Trojan pray'd. Jove, Father, who on Ida seated, seest And rulest all below, glorious in power! Of these two champions, to the drear abodes Of Ades him appoint who furnish'd first The cause of strife between them, and let peace Oath-bound, and amity unite the rest! So spake the hosts; then Hector shook the lots, Majestic Chief, turning his face aside. Forth sprang the lot of Paris. They in ranks Sat all, where stood the fiery steeds of each, And where his radiant arms lay on the field. Illustrious Alexander his bright arms Put on, fair Helen's paramour. He clasp'd His polish'd greaves with silver studs secured; His brother's corslet to his breast he bound, Lycaon's, apt to his own shape and size, And slung athwart his shoulders, bright emboss'd, His brazen sword; his massy buckler broad He took, and to his graceful head his casque Adjusted elegant, which, as he moved, Its bushy crest waved dreadful; last he seized, Well fitted to his gripe, his ponderous spear. Meantime the hero Menelaus made Like preparation, and his arms put on. When thus, from all the multitude apart, Both combatants had arm'd, with eyes that flash'd Defiance, to the middle space they strode, Trojans and Greeks between. Astonishment Seized all beholders. On the measured ground Full near they stood, each brandishing on high His massy spear, and each was fiery wroth. First, Alexander his long-shadow'd spear Sent forth, and on his smooth shield's surface struck The son of Atreus, but the brazen guard Pierced not, for at the disk, with blunted point Reflex, his ineffectual weapon stay'd. Then Menelaus to the fight advanced Impetuous, after prayer offer'd to Jove. King over all! now grant me to avenge My wrongs on Alexander; now subdue The aggressor under me; that men unborn May shudder at the thought of faith abused, And hospitality with rape repaid. He said, and brandishing his massy spear, Dismiss'd it. Through the burnish'd buckler broad Of Priam's son the stormy weapon flew, Transpierced his costly hauberk, and the vest Ripp'd on his flank; but with a sideward bend He baffled it, and baulk'd the dreadful death. Then Menelaus drawing his bright blade, Swung it aloft, and on the hairy crest Smote him; but shiver'd into fragments small The falchion at the stroke fell from his hand. Vexation fill'd him; to the spacious heavens He look'd, and with a voice of woe exclaim'd— Jupiter! of all powers by man adored To me most adverse! Confident I hoped Revenge for Paris' treason, but my sword Is shiver'd, and I sped my spear in vain. So saying, he sprang on him, and his long crest Seized fast; then, turning, drew him by that hold Toward the Greecian host. The broider'd band That underbraced his helmet at the chin, Strain'd to his smooth neck with a ceaseless force, Choak'd him; and now had Menelaus won Deathless renown, dragging him off the field, But Venus, foam-sprung Goddess, feeling quick His peril imminent, snapp'd short the brace Though stubborn, by a slaughter'd Because the hide of a beast that dies in health is tougher and fitter for use than of another that dies diseased. ox supplied, And the void helmet follow'd as he pull'd. That prize the Hero, whirling it aloft, Threw to his Greeks, who caught it and secured, Then with vindictive strides he rush'd again On Paris, spear in hand; but him involved In mist opaque Venus with ease divine Snatch'd thence, and in his chamber placed him, fill'd With scents odorous, spirit-soothing sweets. Nor stay'd the Goddess, but at once in quest Of Helen went; her on a lofty tower She found, where many a damsel stood of Troy, Aud twitch'd her fragrant robe. In form she seem'd An ancient matron, who, while Helen dwelt In Lacedæmon, her unsullied wool Dress'd for her, faithfullest of all her train. Like her disguised the Goddess thus began. Haste—Paris calls thee—on his sculptured couch, (Sparkling alike his looks and his attire,) He waits thy wish'd return. Thou would'st not dream That he had fought; he rather seems prepared For dance, or after dance, for soft repose. So saying, she tumult raised in Helen's mind. Yet soon as by her symmetry of neck, By her love-kindling breasts and luminous eyes She knew the Goddess, her she thus bespake. Ah whence, deceitful deity! thy wish Now to ensnare me? Would'st thou lure me, say, To some fair city of Mæonian name Or Phrygian, more remote from Sparta still? Hast thou some human favourite also there? Is it because Atrides hath prevailed To vanquish Paris, and would bear me home Unworthy as I am, that thou attempt'st Again to cheat me? Go thyself—sit thou Beside him,—for his sake renounce the skies; Watch him, weep for him; till at length his wife He deign to make thee, or perchance his slave. I go not (now to go were shame indeed,) To dress his couch; nor will I be the jest Of all my sex in Ilium. Oh! my griefs Are infinite, and more than I can bear. To whom, the foam-sprung Goddess, thus incensed. Ah wretch! provoke not me; lest in my wrath Abandoning thee, I not hate thee less Than now I fondly love thee, and beget Such detestation of thee in all hearts, Greecian and Trojan, that thou die abhorr'd. The Goddess ceased. Jove's daughter, Helen, fear'd, And, in her lucid veil close wrapt around, Silent retired, of all those Trojan dames Unseen, and Venus led, herself, the way. Soon then as Alexander's fair abode They reach'd, her maidens quick their tasks resumed, And she to her own chamber lofty-roof'd Ascended, loveliest of her sex. A seat For Helen, daughter of Jove Ægis-arm'd, To Paris opposite, the Queen of smiles Herself disposed; but with averted eyes She sat before him, and him keen reproach'd. Thou hast escaped.—Ah would that thou had'st died By that heroic arm, mine husband's erst! Thou once didst vaunt thee in address and strength Superior. Go then—challenge yet again The warlike Menelaus forth to fight. But hold. The hero of the amber locks Provoke no more so rashly, lest the point Of his victorious spear soon stretch thee dead. She ended, to whom Paris thus replied. Ah Helen, wound me not with taunt severe! Me, Menelaus, by Minerva's aid, Hath vanquish'd now, who may hereafter, him. We also have our Gods. But let us love. For never since the day when thee I bore From pleasant Lacedæmon o'er the waves To Cranäe's fair isle, and first enjoy'd Thy beauty, loved I as I love thee now, Or felt such sweetness of intense desire. He spake, and sought his bed, whom follow'd soon Jove's daughter, reconciled to his embrace. But Menelaus like a lion ranged The multitude, enquiring far and near For Paris lost. Yet neither Trojan him Nor friend of Troy could shew, whom, else, through love None had conceal'd, for him as death itself All hated, but his going none had seen. Amidst them all then spake the King of men. Trojans, and Dardans, and allies of Troy! The warlike Menelaus hath prevailed, As is most plain. Now therefore bring ye forth Helen with all her treasures, also bring Such large amercement as is meet, a sum To be remember'd in all future times. So spake Atrides, and Achaia's host With loud applause confirm'd the monarch's claim. BOOK IV. ARGUMENT OF THE FOURTH BOOK. In a Council of the Gods, a dispute arises between Jupiter and Juno, which is at last compromised, Jove consenting to dispatch Minerva with a charge to incite some Trojan to a violation of the truce. Minerva descends for that purpose, and in the form of Laodocus, a son of Priam, exhorts Pandarus to shoot at Menelaus, and succeeds. Menelaus is wounded, and Agamemnon having consigned him to the care of Machaon, goes forth to perform the duties of commander in chief, in the encouragement of his host to battle. The battle begins. Now, on the golden floor of Jove's abode The Gods all sat consulting; Hebe them, Graceful, with nectar served; they pledging each His next, alternate quaff'd from cups of gold, And at their ease reclined, look'd down on Troy; When, sudden, Jove essay'd by piercing speech Invidious, to enkindle Juno's ire. Two Goddesses on Menelaus' part Confederate stand, Juno in Argos known, Pallas in Alalcomene A town of that name in Bœotia, where Pallas was particularly worshipped.; yet they Sequester'd sit, look on, and are amused. Not so smile-loving Venus; she, beside Her champion station'd, saves him from his fate, And at this moment, by her aid, he lives. But now, since victory hath proved the lot Of warlike Menelaus, weigh ye well The matter; shall we yet the ruinous strife Prolong between the nations, or consent To give them peace? should peace your preference win, And prove alike acceptable to all, Stand Ilium, and let Menelaus bear Helen of Argos back to Greece again. He ended; Juno and Minerva heard, Low-murmuring deep disgust; for side by side They forging sat calamity to Troy. Minerva through displeasure against Jove Nought utter'd, for with rage her bosom boil'd; But Juno check'd not hers, who thus replied. What word hath pass'd thy lips, Jove most severe! How? wouldst thou render fruitless all my pains? The sweat that I have pour'd? my steeds themselves Have fainted while I gather'd Greece in arms For punishment of Priam and his sons. Do it. But small thy praise shall be in heaven. Then her the Thunderer answer'd sore displeased. Ah shameless! how have Priam and his sons So much transgress'd against thee, that thou burn'st With ceaseless rage to ruin populous Troy? Go, make thine entrance at her lofty gates, Priam and all his house, and all his host Alive devour; then, haply, thou wilt rest; Do even as thou wilt, that this dispute Live not between us a consuming fire For ever. But attend; mark well the word. When I shall also doom in future time Some city to destruction, dear to thee, Oppose me not, but give my fury way As I give way to thine, not pleased myself, Yet not unsatisfied, so thou be pleased. For of all cities of the sons of men, And which the sun and stars from heaven behold, Me sacred Troy most pleases, Priam me Most, and the people of the warrior King. Nor without cause. They feed mine altar well; Libation there, and steam of savoury scent Fail not, the tribute which by lot is ours. Him answer'd, then, the Goddess ample-eyed ??????, constant description of Juno, but not susceptible of literal translation., Majestic Juno: Three fair cities me, Of all the earth, most interest and engage, Mycenæ for magnificence renown'd, Argos, and Sparta. Them, when next thy wrath Shall be inflamed against them, lay thou waste; I will not interpose on their behalf; Thou shalt not hear me murmur; what avail Complaint or force against thy matchless arm? Yet were it most unmeet that even I Should toil in vain; I also boast a birth Celestial; Saturn deeply wise, thy Sire, Is also mine; our origin is one. Thee I acknowledge Sovereign, yet account Myself entitled by a twofold claim To veneration both from Gods and men, The daughter of Jove's sire, and spouse of Jove. Concession mutual therefore both thyself Befits and me, whom when the Gods perceive Disposed to peace, they also shall accord. Come then.—To yon dread field dispatch in haste Minerva, with command that she incite The Trojans first to violate their oath By some fresh insult on the exulting Greeks. So Juno; nor the sire of all refused, But in wing'd accents thus to Pallas spake. Begone; swift fly to yonder field; incite The Trojans first to violate their oath By some fresh insult on the exulting Greeks. The Goddess heard, and what she wish'd, enjoin'd, Down-darted swift from the Olympian heights, In form a meteor, such as from his hand Not seldom Jove dismisses, beaming bright And breaking into stars, an omen sent To mariners, or to some numerous host. Such Pallas seem'd, and swift descending, dropp'd Full in the midst betwen them. They with awe That sign portentous and with wonder view'd, Achaians both and Trojans, and his next The soldier thus bespake. Now either war And dire hostility again shall flame, Or Jove now gives us peace. Both are from Jove. So spake the soldiery; but she the form Taking of brave Laodocus, the son Of old Antenor, throughout all the ranks Sought godlike Pandarus. Ere long she found The valiant son illustrious of Lycaon, Standing encompass'd by his dauntless troops, Broad-shielded warriors, from Æsepus' stream His followers; to his side the Goddess came, And in wing'd accents ardent him bespake. Brave offspring of Lycaon, is there hope That thou wilt hear my counsel? darest thou slip A shaft at Menelaus? much renown Thou shalt and thanks from all the Trojans win, But most of all, from Paris, prince of Troy. From him illustrious gifts thou shalt receive Doubtless, when Menelaus he shall see The martial son of Atreus by a shaft Subdued of thine, placed on his funeral pile. Come. Shoot at Menelaus, glorious Chief! But vow to Lycian Phœbus bow-renown'd An hecatomb, all firstlings of the flock, To fair Zeleia's walls once safe restored. So Pallas spake, to whom infatuate he Listening, uncased at once his polish'd bow. That bow, the laden brows of a wild goat Salacious had supplied; him on a day Forth-issuing from his cave, in ambush placed He wounded with an arrow to his breast Dispatch'd, and on the rock supine he fell. Each horn had from his head tall growth attain'd, Full sixteen palms; them shaven smooth the smith Had aptly join'd, and tipt their points with gold. That bow he strung, then, stooping, planted firm The nether horn, his comrades bold the while Screening him close with shields, lest ere the prince Were stricken, Menelaus, brave in arms, The Greeks with fierce assault should interpose. He raised his quiver's lid; he chose a dart Unflown, full-fledged, and barb'd with pangs of death. He lodged in haste the arrow on the string, And vow'd to Lycian Phœbus bow-renown'd An hecatomb, all firstlings of the flock, To fair Zeleia's walls once safe restored. Compressing next nerve and notch'd arrow-head He drew back both together, to his pap Drew home the nerve, the barb home to his bow, And when the horn was curved to a wide arch, He twang'd it. Whizz'd the bowstring, and the reed Leap'd off, impatient for the distant throng. Thee, Menelaus, then the blessed Gods Forgat not; Pallas huntress of the spoil, Thy guardian then, baffled the cruel dart. Far as a mother wafts the fly aside That haunts her slumbering babe, so far she drove Its course aslant, directing it herself Against the golden clasps that join'd his belt; For there the doubled hauberk interposed. The bitter arrow plunged into his belt. It pierced his broider'd belt, stood fixt within His twisted hauberk, nor the interior quilt, Though penetrable least to arrow-points And his best guard, withheld it, but it pass'd That also, and the Hero's skin inscribed. Quick flowed a sable current from the wound. As when a Carian or Mæonian maid Impurples ivory ordain'd to grace The cheek of martial steed; safe stored it lies, By many a Chief desired, but proves at last The stately trapping of some prince, the pride Of his high pamper'd steed, nor less his own; Such, Menelaus, seem'd thy shapely thighs, Thy legs, thy feet, stained with thy trickling blood. Shudder'd King Agamemnon when he saw The blood fast trickling from the wound, nor less Shudder'd himself the bleeding warrior bold. But neck and barb observing from the flesh Extant, he gather'd heart, and lived again. Then royal Agamemnon, sighing, grasp'd The hand of Menelaus, and while all Their followers sigh'd around them, thus began. I swore thy death, my brother, when I swore This truce, and set thee forth in sight of Greeks And Trojans, our sole champion; for the foe Hath trodden underfoot his sacred oath, And stained it with thy blood. But not in vain, The truce was ratified, the blood of lambs Poured forth, libation made, and right hands join'd In holy confidence. The wrath of Jove May sleep, but will not always; they shall pay Dear penalty; their own obnoxious heads Shall be the mulct, their children and their wives. For this I know, know surely; that a day Shall come, when Ilium, when the warlike King Of Ilium and his host shall perish all. Saturnian Jove high-throned, dwelling in heaven, Resentful of this outrage, then shall shake His storm-clad Ægis over them. He will; I speak no fable. Time shall prove me true. But, oh my Menelaus, dire distress Awaits me, if thy close of life be come, And thou must die. Then ignominy foul Shall hunt me back to Argos long-desired; For then all here will recollect their home, And, hope abandoning, will Helen yield To be the boast of Priam, and of Troy. So shall our toils be vain, and while thy bones Shall waste these clods beneath, Troy's haughty sons The tomb of Menelaus glory-crown'd Insulting barbarous, shall scoff at me. So may Atrides, shall they say, perform His anger still as he performed it here, Whither he led an unsuccessful host, Whence he hath sail'd again without the spoils, And where he left his brother's bones to rot. So shall the Trojan speak; then open earth Her mouth, and hide me in her deepest gulfs! But him, the hero of the golden locks Thus cheer'd. My brother, fear not, nor infect With fear the Greecians; the sharp-pointed reed Hath touch'd no vital part. The broider'd zone, The hauberk, and the tough interior quilt, Work of the armourer, its force repress'd. Him answer'd Agamemnon, King of men. So be it, brother! but the hand of one Skilful to heal shall visit and shall dress The wound with drugs of pain-assuaging power. He ended, and his noble herald, next, Bespake, Talthybius. Haste, call hither quick The son of Æsculapius, leech renown'd, The prince Machaon. Bid him fly to attend The warlike Chieftain Menelaus; him Some archer, either Lycian or of Troy, A dexterous one, hath stricken with a shaft To his own glory, and to our distress. He spake, nor him the herald disobey'd, But through the Greeks bright-arm'd his course began The Hero seeking earnest on all sides Machaon. Him, ere long, he station'd saw Amid the shielded-ranks of his brave band From steed-famed Tricca drawn, and at his side With accents ardour-wing'd, him thus address'd. Haste, Asclepiades! The king of men Calls thee. Delay not. Thou must visit quick Brave Menelaus, Atreus' son, for him Some archer, either Lycian or of Troy, A dexterous one, hath stricken with a shaft To his own glory, and to our distress. So saying, he roused Machaon, who his course Through the wide host began. Arriving soon Where wounded Menelaus stood, while all The bravest of Achaia's host around The Godlike hero press'd, he strove at once To draw the arrow from his cincture forth, But, drawing, bent the barbs. He therefore loosed His broider'd belt, his hauberk and his quilt, Work of the armourer, and laying bare His body where the bitter shaft had plow'd His flesh, he suck'd the wound, then spread it o'er With drugs of balmy power, given on a time For friendship's sake by Chiron to his sire. While Menelaus thus the cares engross'd Of all those Chiefs, the shielded powers of Troy 'Gan move toward them, and the Greeks again Put on their armour, mindful of the fight. Then hadst thou not great Agamemnon seen Slumbering, or trembling, or averse from war, But ardent to begin his glorious task. His steeds, and his bright chariot brass-inlaid He left; the snorting steeds Eurymedon, Offspring of Ptolemy Piraïdes Detain'd apart; for him he strict enjoin'd Attendance near, lest weariness of limbs Should seize him marshalling his numerous host. So forth he went, and through the files on foot Proceeding, where the warrior Greeks he saw Alert, he roused them by his words the more. Argives! abate no spark of all your fire. Jove will not prosper traitors. Them who first Transgress'd the truce the vultures shall devour, But we (their city taken) shall their wives Lead captive, and their children home to Greece. So cheer'd he them. But whom he saw supine, Or in the rugged work of war remiss, In terms of anger them he stern rebuked. Oh Greeks! The shame of Argos! Arrow-doom'd! Blush ye not? Wherefore stand ye thus aghast, Like fawns which wearied after scouring wide The champaign, gaze and pant, and can no more? Senseless like them ye stand, nor seek the fight. Is it your purpose patient here to wait Till Troy invade your vessels on the shore Of the grey deep, that ye may trial make Of Jove, if he will prove, himself, your shield? Thus, in discharge of his high office, pass'd Atrides through the ranks, and now arrived Where, hardy Chief! Idomeneus in front Of his bold Cretans stood, stout as a boar. The van he occupied, while in the rear Meriones harangued the most remote. Them so prepared the King of men beheld With joyful heart, and thus in courteous terms Instant the brave Idomeneus address'd. Thee fighting, feasting, howsoe'er employed, I most respect, Idomeneus, of all The well-horsed Danäi; for when the Chiefs Of Argos, banquetting, their beakers charge With rosy wine the honourable meed Of valour, thou alone of all the Greeks Drink'st not by measure. No—thy goblet stands Replenish'd still, and like myself thou know'st No rule or bound, save what thy choice prescribes. March. Seek the foe. Fight now as heretofore. To whom Idomeneus of Crete replied. Atrides! all the friendship and the love Which I have promised will I well perform. Go; animate the rest, Chief after Chief Of the Achaians, that the fight begin. For Troy hath scatter'd to the winds all faith, All conscience, and for such her treachery foul Shall have large recompence of death and woe. He said, whom Agamemnon at his heart Exulting, pass'd, and in his progress came Where stood each Ajax; them he found prepared With all their cloud of infantry behind. As when the goat-herd on some rocky point Advanced, a cloud sees wafted o'er the deep By western gales, and rolling slow along, To him, who stands remote, pitch-black it seems, And comes with tempest charged; he at the sight Shuddering, his flock compels into a cave; So moved the gloomy phalanx, rough with spears, And dense with shields of youthful warriors bold, Close-following either Ajax to the fight. Them also, pleased, the King of men beheld, And in wing'd accents hail'd them as he pass'd. Brave leaders of the mail-clad host of Greece! I move not you to duty; ye yourselves Move others, and no lesson need from me. Jove, Pallas, and Apollo! were but all Courageous as yourselves, soon Priam's towers Should totter, and his Ilium storm'd and sack'd By our victorious bands, stoop to the dust. He ceased, and still proceeding, next arrived Where stood the Pylian orator, his band Marshalling under all their leaders bold Alastor, Chromius, Pelagon the vast, Hæmon the prince, and Bias, martial Chief. Chariot and horse he station'd in the front; His numerous infantry, a strong reserve Right valiant, in the rear; the worst, and those In whom he trusted least, he drove between, That such through mere necessity might act. First to his charioteers he gave in charge Their duty; bade them rein their horses hard, Shunning confusion. Let no warrior, vain And overweening of his strength or skill, Start from his rank to dare the fight alone, Or fall behind it, weakening whom he leaves. Diverse interpretations are given of this passage. I have adopted that which to me appeared most plausible. It seems to be a caution against the mischiefs that might ensue, should the horses be put under the management of a driver with whom they were unacquainted.—The scholium by Villoison much countenances this solution.And if, dismounted from his own, he climb Another's chariot, let him not affect Perverse the reins, but let him stand, his spear Advancing firm, far better so employ'd. Such was the discipline, in ancient times, Of our forefathers; by these rules they fought Successful, and lay'd many a city low. So counsell'd them the venerable Chief Long time expert in arms; him also saw King Agamemnon with delight, and said, Old Chief! ah how I wish that thy firm heart Were but supported by as firm a knee! But time unhinges all. Oh that some youth Had thine old age, and thou wast young again! To whom the valiant Nestor thus replied. Atrides, I could also ardent wish That I were now robust as when I struck Brave Ereuthalion Here Nestor only mentions the name of Ereuthalion, knowing the present to be an improper time for story-telling; in the seventh book he relates his fight and victory at length. This passage may serve to confute those who charge Nestor with indiscriminate loquacity. breathless to the ground! But never all their gifts the Gods confer On man at once; if then I had the force Of youth, I suffer now the effects of age. Yet ancient as I am, I will be seen Still mingling with the charioteers, still prompt To give them counsel; for to counsel youth Is the old warrior's province. Let the green In years, my juniors, unimpaired by time, Push with the lance, for they have strength to boast. So he, whom Agamemnon joyful heard, And passing thence, the son of Peteos found Menestheus, foremost in equestrian fame, Among the brave Athenians; near to him Ulysses held his station, and at hand The Cephallenians stood, hardy and bold; For rumour none of the approaching fight Them yet had reach'd, so recent had the stir Arisen in either host; they, therefore, watch'd Till the example of some other band Marching, should prompt them to begin the fight. But Agamemnon, thus, the King of men Them seeing, sudden and severe reproved. Menestheus, son of Peteos prince renown'd, And thou, deviser of all evil wiles! Adept in artifice! why stand ye here Appall'd? why wait ye on this distant spot 'Till others move? I might expect from you More readiness to meet the burning war, Whom foremost I invite of all to share The banquet, when the Princes feast with me. There ye are prompt; ye find it pleasant there To eat your savoury food, and quaff your wine Delicious, 'till satiety ensue; But here ye could be well content to stand Spectators only, while ten Greecian troops Should wage before you the wide-wasting war. To whom Ulysses, with resentful tone Dark-frowning, thus replied. What words are these Which have escaped thy lips; and for what cause, Atrides, hast thou call'd me slow to fight? When we of Greece shall in sharp contest clash With yon steed-tamer Trojans, mark me then; Then thou shalt see (if the concerns of war So nearly touch thee, and thou so incline) The father of Telemachus, engaged Among the foremost Trojans. But thy speech Was light as is the wind, and rashly made. When him thus moved he saw, the monarch smiled Complacent, and in gentler terms replied. Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd! Short reprimand and exhortation short Suffice for thee, nor did I purpose more. For I have known thee long, that thou art one Of kindest nature, and so much my friend That we have both one heart. Go therefore thou, Lead on, and if a word have fallen amiss, We will hereafter mend it, and may heaven Obliterate in thine heart it's whole effect! He ceased, and ranging still along the line, The son of Tydeus, Diomede, perceived, Heroic Chief, by chariots all around Environ'd, and by steeds, at side of whom Stood Sthenelus, the son of Capaneus. Him also, Agamemnon, King of men, In accents of asperity reproved. Ah, son of Tydeus, Chief of dauntless heart And of equestrian fame! why standest thou Appall'd, and peering through the walks of war? So did not Tydeus. In the foremost fight His favourite station was, as they affirm Who witness'd his exploits; I never saw Or met him, but by popular report He was the bravest warrior of his day. Yet came he once, but not in hostile sort, To fair Mycenæ, by the Godlike prince Attended, Polynices, at what time The host was called together, and the siege Was purposed of the sacred city Thebes. Earnest they sued for an auxiliar band, Which we had gladly granted, but that Jove By unpropitious tokens interfered. So forth they went, and on the reedy banks Arriving of Asopus, there thy sire By designation of the Greeks was sent Ambassador, and enter'd Thebes. He found In Eteocles' palace numerous guests, The sons of Cadmus feasting, among whom, Although a solitary stranger, stood Thy father without fear, and challenged forth Their best to cope with him in manly games. Them Tydeus vanquish'd easily, such aid Pallas vouchsafed him. Then the spur-arm'd race Of Cadmus was incensed, and fifty youths In ambush close expected his return. Them, Lycophontes obstinate in fight, Son of Autophonus, and Mæon, son Of Hæmon, Chief of Godlike stature, led. Those also Tydeus slew; Mæon except, (Whom, warned from heaven, he spared, and sent him home With tidings of the rest,) he slew them all. Such was Ætolian Tydeus; who begat A son in speech his better, not in arms. He ended, and his sovereign's awful voice Tydides reverencing, nought replied; But thus the son of glorious Capaneus. Atrides, conscious of the truth, speak truth. We with our sires compared, superior praise Claim justly. We, confiding in the aid Of Jove, and in propitious signs from heaven, Led to the city consecrate to Mars Our little host, inferior far to theirs, And took seven-gated Thebes, under whose walls Our fathers by their own imprudence fell. Their glory, then, match never more with ours. He spake, whom with a frowning brow the brave Tydides, answer'd. Sthenelus, my friend! I give thee counsel. Mark it. Hold thy peace. If Agamemnon, who hath charge of all, Excite his well-appointed host to war, He hath no blame from me. For should the Greeks (Her people vanquish'd) win imperial Troy, The glory shall be his; or, if his host O'erpower'd in battle perish, his the shame. Come, therefore; be it ours to rouse at once To action all the fury of our might. He said, and from his chariot to the plain Leap'd ardent; rang the armour on the breast Of the advancing Chief; the boldest heart Had felt emotion, startled at the sound. As when the waves by Zephyrus up-heaved Crowd fast toward some sounding shore, at first, On the broad bosom of the deep their heads They curl on high, then breaking on the land Thunder, and o'er the rocks that breast the flood Borne turgid, scatter far the showery spray; So moved the Greeks successive, rank by rank, And phalanx after phalanx, every Chief His loud command proclaiming, while the rest, As voice in all those thousands none had been, Heard mute; and, in resplendent armour clad, With martial order terrible advanced. Not so the Trojans came. As sheep, the flock Of some rich man, by thousands in his court Penn'd close at milking time, incessant bleat, Loud answering all their bleating lambs without, Such din from Ilium's wide-spread host arose. Nor was their shout, nor was their accent one, But mingled languages were heard of men From various climes. These Mars of battle roused, Those Pallas azure-eyed; nor Terror thence Nor Flight was absent, nor insatiate Strife, Sister and mate of homicidal Mars, Who small at first, but swift to grow, from earth Her towering crest lifts gradual to the skies. She, foe alike to both, the brands dispersed Of burning hate between them, and the woes Enhanced of battle wheresoe'er she pass'd. And now the battle join'd. Shield clash'd with shield, And spear with spear, conflicting corslets rang, Boss'd bucklers met, and tumult wild arose. Then, many a yell was heard, and many a shout Loud intermix'd, the slayer o'er the maim'd Exulting, and the field was drench'd with blood. As when two winter torrents rolling down The mountains, shoot their floods through gulleys huge Into one gulf below, station'd remote The shepherd in the uplands hears the roar; Such was the thunder of the mingling hosts. And first, Antilochus a Trojan Chief Slew Echepolus, from Thalysias sprung, Contending valiant in the van of Troy. Him smiting on his crested casque, he drove The brazen lance into his front, and pierced The bones within; night overspread his eyes, And in fierce battle, like a tower, he fell. Him fallen by both feet Calchodon's son Seized, royal Elephenor, leader brave Of the Abantes, and in haste to strip His armour, drew him from the fight aside. But short was that attempt. Him so employ'd Dauntless Agenor mark'd, and as he stoop'd, In his unshielded flank a pointed spear Implanted deep; he languid sunk and died. So Elephenor fell, for whom arose Sharp conflict; Greeks and Trojans mutual flew Like wolves to battle, and man grappled man. Then Telamonian Ajax, in his prime Of youthful vigour Simöisius slew, Son of Anthemion. Him on Simoïs' banks His mother bore, when with her parents once She came from Ida down to view the flocks, And thence they named him; but his parents' love He lived not to requite, in early youth Slain by the spear of Ajax famed in arms. For him advancing Ajax at the pap Wounded; right through his shoulder driven the point Stood forth behind; he fell, and press'd the dust. So in some spacious marsh the poplar falls Smooth-skinn'd, with boughs unladen save aloft; Some chariot-builder with his axe the trunk Severs, that he may warp it to a wheel Of shapely form; meantime exposed it lies To parching airs beside the running stream; Such Simoisius seemed, Anthemion's son, Whom noble Ajax slew. But soon at him Antiphus, son of Priam, bright in arms, Hurl'd through the multitude his pointed spear. He erred from Ajax, but he pierced the groin Of Leucus, valiant warrior of the band Led by Ulysses. He the body dragg'd Apart, but fell beside it, and let fall, Breathless himself, the burthen from his hand. Then burn'd Ulysses' wrath for Leucus slain, And through the foremost combatants, array'd In dazzling arms, he rush'd. Full near he stood, And, looking keen around him, hurl'd a lance. Back fell the Trojans from before the face Dispersed of great Ulysses. Not in vain His weapon flew, but on the field outstretch'd A spurious son of Priam, from the shores Call'd of Abydus famed for fleetest mares, Democoon; him, for Leucus' sake enraged, Ulysses through both temples with his spear Transpierced. The night of death hung on his eyes, And sounding on his batter'd arms he fell. Then Hector and the van of Troy retired; Loud shout the Greecians; these draw off the dead, Those onward march amain, and from the heights Of Pergamus Apollo looking down In anger, to the Trojans called aloud. Turn, turn, ye Trojans! face your Greecian foes. They, like yourselves, are vulnerable flesh, Not adamant or steel. Your direst dread Achilles, son of Thetis radiant-hair'd, Fights not, but sullen in his fleet abides. Such from the citadel was heard the voice Of dread Apollo. But Minerva ranged Meantime, Tritonian progeny of Jove, The Greecians, rousing whom she saw remiss. Then Amarynceus' son, Diores, felt The force of fate, bruised by a rugged rock At his right heel, which Pirus, Thracian Chief, The son of Imbrasus of Ænos, threw. Bones and both tendons in its fall the mass Enormous crush'd. He, stretch'd in dust supine, With palms outspread toward his warrior friends Lay gasping life away. But he who gave The fatal blow, Pirus, advancing, urged Into his navel a keen lance, and shed His bowels forth; then, darkness veil'd his eyes. Nor Pirus long survived; him through the breast, Above the pap, Ætolian Thoas pierced, And in his lungs set fast the quivering spear. Then Thoas swift approach'd, pluck'd from the wound His stormy spear, and with his falchion bright Gashing his middle belly, stretch'd him dead. Yet stripp'd he not the slain, whom with long spears His Thracians hairy-scalp'd ?????????. They wore only a lock of hair on the crown of the head. so round about Encompassed, that though bold and large of limb Were Thoas, from before them him they thrust Staggering and reeling in his forced retreat. They therefore in the dust, the Epean Chief Diores, and the Thracian, Pirus lay Stretch'd side by side, with numerous slain around. Then had Minerva led through all that field Some warrior yet unhurt, him sheltering safe From all annoyance dread of dart or spear, No cause of blame in either had he found That day, so many Greeks and Trojans press'd, Extended side by side, the dusty plain. BOOK V. ARGUMENT OF THE FIFTH BOOK. Diomede is extraordinarily distinguished. He kills Pandarus, who had violated the truce, and wounds first Venus, and then Mars. Then Athenæan Pallas on the son Of Tydeus, Diomede, new force conferr'd And daring courage, that the Argives all He might surpass, and deathless fame achieve. Fires on his helmet, and his shield around She kindled, bright and steady as the star Autumnal, which in Ocean newly bathed Assumes fresh beauty; with such glorious beams His head encircling and his shoulders broad, She urged him forth into the thickest fight. There lived a man in Troy, Dares his name, The priest of Vulcan; rich he was and good, The father of two sons, Idæus this, That, Phegeus call'd; accomplish'd warriors both. These, issuing from their phalanx, push'd direct Their steeds at Diomede, who fought on foot. When now small interval was left between, First Phegeus his long-shadow'd spear dismiss'd; But over Diomedes' left shoulder pass'd The point, innocuous. Then his splendid lance Tydides hurl'd; nor ineffectual flew The weapon from his hand, but Phegeus pierced His paps between, and foreed him to the ground. At once, his sumptuous chariot left, down leap'd Idæus wanting courage to defend His brother slain; nor had he scaped himself His louring fate, but Vulcan, to preserve His ancient priest from unmixt sorrow, snatch'd The fugitive in darkness wrapt, away. Then brave Tydides, driving off the steeds, Consign'd them to his fellow-warriors' care, That they might lead them down into the fleet. The valiant Trojans, when they saw the sons Of Dares, one beside his chariot slain, And one by flight preserved, through all their host Felt consternation. Then Minerva seized The hand of fiery Mars, and thus she spake. Gore-tainted, homicide, town-battering Mars! Leave we the Trojans and the Greeks to wage Fierce fight alone, Jove prospering whom he will, So shall we not provoke our father's ire. She said, and from the fight conducted forth The impetuous Deity, whom on the side She seated of Scamander deep-embank'd ???????.. And now the host of Troy to flight inclined Before the Greecians, and the Chiefs of Greece Each slew a warrior. Agememnon first Gigantic Odius from his chariot hurl'd, Chief of the Halizonians. He to flight Turn'd foremost, when the monarch in his spine Between the shoulder-bones his spear infixt, And urged it through his breast. Sounding he fell, And loud his batter'd armour rang around. By brave Idomeneus a Lydian died, Phæstus, from fruitful Tarne sent to Troy, Son of Mæonian Borus; him his steeds Mounting, Idomeneus the spear-renown'd Through his right shoulder pierced; unwelcome night Involved him; from his chariot down he fell, And the attendant Cretans stripp'd his arms. But Menelaus, son of Atreus slew With his bright spear Scamandrius, Stropius' son, A skilful hunter; for Diana him, Herself, the slaughter of all savage kinds Had taught, on mountain or in forest bred. But she, shaft-aiming Goddess, in that hour Avail'd him not, nor his own matchless skill; For Menelaus, Atreus son spear-famed, Him flying wounded in the spine between His shoulders, and the spear urged through his breast. Prone on his loud-resounding arms he fell. Next, by Meriones Phereclus died, Son of Harmonides. All arts that ask A well-instructed hand his sire had learn'd, For Pallas dearly loved him. He the fleet, Prime source of harm to Troy and to himself, For Paris built, unskill'd to spell aright The oracles predictive of the woe. Phereclus fled; Meriones his flight Outstripping, deep in his posterior flesh A spear infix'd; sliding beneath the bone It grazed his bladder as it pass'd, and stood Protruded far before. Low on his knees Phereclus sank, and with a shriek expired. Pedæus, whom, although his spurious son, Antenor's wife, to gratify her Lord, Had cherish'd as her own—him Meges slew. Warlike Phylides Meges, son of Phyleus. following close his flight, His keen lance drove into his poll, cut sheer His tongue within, and through his mouth enforced The glittering point. He, prostrate in the dust, The cold steel press'd between his teeth and died. Eurypylus, Evemon's son, the brave Hypsenor slew; Dolopion was his sire, Priest of Scamander, reverenced as a God. In vain before Eurypylus he fled; He, running, with his falchion lopp'd his arm Fast by the shoulder; on the field his hand Fell blood-distained, and destiny severe With shades of death for ever veil'd his eyes. Thus strenuous they the toilsome battle waged. But where Tydides fought, whether in aid Of Ilium's host, or on the part of Greece, Might none discern. For as a winter-flood Impetuous, mounds and bridges sweeps away; The buttress'd bridge checks not its sudden force, The firm inclosure of vine-planted fields Luxuriant, falls before it, finish'd works Of youthful hinds, once pleasant to the eye, Now levell'd, after ceaseless rain from Jove; So drove Tydides into sudden flight The Trojans; phalanx after phalanx fled Before the terror of his single arm. When him Lycaon's son illustrious saw Scouring the field, and from before his face The ranks dispersing wide, at once he bent Against Tydides his elastic bow. The arrow met him in his swift career Sure-aim'd; it struck direct the hollow mail Of his right shoulder, with resistless force Transfix'd it, and his hauberk stain'd with blood. Loud shouted then Lycaon's son renown'd. Rush on, ye Trojans, spur your coursers hard. Our fiercest foe is wounded, and I deem His death not distant far, if me the King Apollo. Jove's son, indeed, from Lycia sent to Troy. So boasted Pandarus. Yet him the dart Quell'd not. Retreating, at his coursers' heads He stood, and to the son of Capaneus His charioteer and faithful friend he said. Arise, sweet son of Capaneus, dismount, And from my shoulder draw this bitter shaft. He spake; at once the son of Capaneus Descending, by its barb the bitter shaft Drew forth; blood spouted through his twisted mail Incontinent, and thus the Hero pray'd. Unconquer'd daughter of Jove Ægis-arm'd! If ever me, propitious, or my sire Thou hast in furious fight help'd heretofore, Now aid me also. Bring within the reach Of my swift spear, Oh grant me to strike through The warrior who hath check'd my course, and boasts The sun's bright beams for ever quench'd to me! He prayed, and Pallas heard; she braced his limbs, She wing'd him with alacrity divine, And standing at his side, him thus bespake. Now Diomede, be bold! Fight now with Troy. To thee, thy father's spirit I impart Fearless; shield-shaking Tydeus felt the same. I also from thine eye the darkness purge Which dimm'd thy sight before, that thou may'st know Both Gods and men; should, therefore other God Approach to try thee, fight not with the powers Immortal; but if foam-born Venus come, Her spare not. Wound her with thy glittering spear. So spake the blue-eyed Deity, and went. Then with the champions in the van again Tydides mingled; hot before, he fights With threefold fury now, nor less enraged Than some gaunt lion whom o'erleaping light The fold, a shepherd hath but gall'd, not kill'd, Him irritating more; thenceforth the swain Lurks unresisting; flies the abandon'd flock; Heaps slain on heaps he leaves, and with a bound Surmounting all impediment, escapes; Such seem'd the valiant Diomede incensed To fury, mingling with the host of Troy. Astynoüs and Hypenor first he slew; One with his brazen lance above the pap He pierced, and one with his huge falchion smote Fast by the key-bone Or collar-bone., from the neck and spine His parted shoulder driving at a blow. Them leaving, Polyides next he sought And Abas, sons of a dream-dealing seer, Eurydamas; their hoary father's dreams Or not interpreted, or kept concealed, Them saved not, for by Diomede they died. Xanthus and Thöon he encounter'd next, Both sons of Phænops, sons of his old age, Who other heir had none of all his wealth, Nor hoped another, worn with many years. Tydides slew them both; nor aught remain'd To the old man but sorrow for his sons For ever lost, and strangers were his heirs. Two sons of Priam in one chariot borne Echemon next, and Chromius felt his hand Resistless. As a lion on the herd Leaping, while they the shrubs and bushes browze, Breaks short the neck of heifer or of steer, So them, though clinging fast and loth to fall, Tydides hurl'd together to the ground, Then stripp'd their splendid armour, and the steeds Consigned and chariot to his soldiers' care. Æneas him discern'd scattering the ranks, And through the battle and the clash of spears Went seeking Godlike Pandarus; ere long Finding Lycaon's martial son renown'd, He stood before him, and him thus address'd. Thy bow, thy feather'd shafts, and glorious name Where are they, Pandarus? whom none of Troy Could equal, whom of Lycia, none excel. Come. Lift thine hands to Jove, and at yon Chief Dispatch an arrow, who afflicts the host Of Ilium thus, conquering where'er he flies, And who hath slaughter'd numerous brave in arms. But him some Deity I rather deem Avenging on us his neglected rites, And who can stand before an angry God? Him answer'd then Lycaon's son renown'd. Brave leader of the Trojans brazen-mail'd, Æneas! By his buckler which I know, And by his helmet's height, considering too His steeds, I deem him Diomede the bold; Yet such pronounce him not, who seems a God. But if bold Diomede indeed he be Of whom I speak, not without aid from heaven His fury thus prevails, but at his side Some God, in clouds enveloped, turns away From him the arrow to a devious course. Already, at his shoulder's hollow mail My shaft hath pierced him through, and him I deem'd Dismiss'd full sure to Pluto ere his time; But he survives; whom therefore I at last Perforce conclude some angry Deity. Steeds have I none or chariot to ascend, Who have eleven chariots in the stands Left of Lycaon, with fair hangings all O'ermantled, strong, new finish'd, with their steeds In pairs beside them, eating winnow'd grain. Me much Lycaon my old valiant sire At my departure from his palace gates Persuaded, that my chariot and my steeds Ascending, I should so conduct my bands To battle; counsel wise, and ill-refused! But anxious, lest, (the host in Troy so long Immew'd,) my steeds, fed plenteously at home, Should here want food, I left them, and on foot To Ilium came, confiding in my bow Ordain'd at last to yield me little good. Twice have I shot, and twice I struck the mark, First Menelaus, and Tydides next; From each I drew the blood, true, genuine blood, Yet have but more incensed them. In an hour Unfortunate, I therefore took my bow Down from the wall that day, when for the sake Of noble Hector, to these pleasant plains I came, a leader on the part of Troy. But should I once return, and with these eyes Again behold my native land, my sire, My wife, my stately mansion, may the hand, That moment, of some adversary there Shorten me by the head, if I not snap This bow with which I charged myself in vain, And burn the unprofitable tool to dust. To whom Æneas, Trojan Chief, replied. Nay, speak not so. For ere that hour arrive We will, with chariot and with horse, in arms Encounter him, and put his strength to proof. Delay not, mount my chariot. Thou shalt see With what rapidity the steeds of Troy Pursuing or retreating, scour the field. If after all, Jove purpose still to exalt The son of Tydeus, these shall bear us safe Back to the city. Come then. Let us on. The lash take thou, and the resplendent reins, While I alight for battle, or thyself Receive them, and the steeds shall be my care. Him answer'd then Lycaon's son renown'd. Æneas! manage thou the reins, and guide Thy proper steeds. If fly at last we must The son of Tydeus, they will readier draw Directed by their wonted charioteer. Else, terrified, and missing thy controul, They may refuse to bear us from the fight, And Tydeus' son assailing us, with ease Shall slay us both, and drive thy steeds away. Rule therefore thou the chariot, and myself With my sharp spear will his assault receive. So saying, they mounted both, and furious drove Against Tydides. Them the noble son Of Capaneus observed, and turning quick His speech to Diomede, him thus address'd. Tydides, Diomede, my heart's delight! Two warriors of immeasurable force In battle, ardent to contend with thee, Come rattling on. Lycaon's offspring one, Bow-practised Pandarus; with whom appears Æneas; he who calls the mighty Chief Anchises father, and whom Venus bore. Mount—drive we swift away,—lest borne so far Beyond the foremost battle, thou be slain. To whom, dark-frowning, Diomede replied. Speak not of flight to me, who am disposed To no such course. I am ashamed to fly Or tremble, and my strength is still entire; I cannot mount. No. Rather thus, on foot, I will advance against them. Fear and dread Are not for me; Pallas forbids the thought. One falls, be sure; swift as they are, the steeds That whirl them on, shall never rescue both. But hear my bidding, and hold fast the word. Should all-wise Pallas grant me my desire To slay them both, drive not my coursers hence, But hook the reins, and seizing quick the pair That draw Æneas, urge them from the powers Of Troy away into the host of Greece. For they are sprung from those which Jove to Tros In compensation gave for Ganymede; The Sun himself sees not their like below. Anchises, King of men, clandestine them Obtain'd, his mares submitting to the steeds Of King Laomedon. Six brought him foals; Four to himself reserving, in his stalls He fed them sleek, and two he gave his son: These, might we win them, were a noble prize. Thus mutual they conferr'd; those Chiefs, the while, With swiftest pace approach'd, and first his speech To Diomede Lycaon's son address'd. Heroic offspring of a noble sire, Brave son of Tydeus! false to my intent My shaft hath harm'd thee little. I will now Make trial with my spear, if that may speed. He said, and shaking his long-shadow'd spear, Dismiss'd it. Forceful on the shield it struck Of Diomede, transpierced it, and approach'd With threatening point the hauberk on his breast. Loud shouted Pandarus—Ah nobly thrown! Home to thy bowels. Die, for die thou must, And all the glory of thy death is mine. Then answer thus brave Diomede return'd Undaunted. I am whole. Thy cast was short. But ye desist not, as I plain perceive, Till one at least extended on the plain Shall sate the God of battles with his blood. He said and threw. Pallas the spear herself Directed; at his eye fast by the nose Deep-entering, through his ivory teeth it pass'd, At its extremity divided sheer His tongue, and started through his chin below. He headlong fell, and with his dazzling arms Smote full the plain. Back flew the fiery steeds With swift recoil, and where he fell he died. Then sprang Æneas forth with spear and shield, That none might drag the body; lion-like He stalk'd around it, oval shield and spear Advancing firm, and with incessant cries Terrific, death denouncing on his foes. But Diomede with hollow grasp a stone Enormous seized, a weight to overtask Two strongest men of such as now are strong, Yet He, alone, wielded the rock with ease. Full on the hip he smote him, where the thigh Rolls in its cavity, the socket named. He crush'd the socket, lacerated wide Both tendons, and with that rough-angled mass Flay'd all his flesh. The Hero on his knees Sank, on his ample palm his weight upbore Labouring, and darkness overspread his eyes. There had Æneas perish'd, King of men, Had not Jove's daughter Venus quick perceived His peril imminent, whom she had borne Herself to Anchises pasturing his herds. Her snowy arms her darling son around She threw maternal, and behind a fold Of her bright mantle screening close his breast From mortal harm by some brave Greecian's spear, Stole him with eager swiftness from the fight. Nor then forgat brave Sthenelus his charge Received from Diomede, but his own steeds Detaining distant from the boisterous war, Stretch'd tight the reins, and hook'd them fast behind. The coursers of Æneas next he seized Ardent, and them into the host of Greece Driving remote, consign'd them to his care, Whom far above all others his compeers He loved, Deipylus, his bosom friend Congenial. Him he charged to drive them thence Into the fleet, then, mounting swift his own, Lash'd after Diomede; he, fierce in arms, Pursued the Cyprian Goddess, conscious whom, Not Pallas, not Enyo, waster dread Of cities close-beleaguer'd, none of all Who o'er the battle's bloody course preside, But one of softer kind and prone to fear. When, therefore, her at length, after long chase Through all the warring multitude he reach'd, With his protruded spear her gentle hand He wounded, piercing through her thin attire Ambrosial, by themselves the Graces wrought, Her inside wrist, fast by the rosy palm. Blood follow'd, but immortal; ichor pure, Such as the blest inhabitants of heaven May bleed, nectareous; for the Gods eat not Man's food, nor slake as he with sable wine Their thirst, thence bloodless and from death exempt. She, shrieking, from her arms cast down her son, And Phœbus, in impenetrable clouds Him hiding, lest the spear of some brave Greek Should pierce his bosom, caught him swift away. Then shouted brave Tydides after her— Depart, Jove's daughter! fly the bloody field. Is't not enough that thou beguilest the hearts Of feeble women? If thou dare intrude Again into the war, war's very name Shall make thee shudder, wheresoever heard. He said, and Venus with excess of pain Bewilder'd went; but Iris tempest-wing'd Forth led her through the multitude, oppress'd With anguish, her white wrist to livid changed. They came where Mars far on the left retired Of battle sat, his horses and his spear In darkness veil'd. Before her brother's knees She fell, and with entreaties urgent sought The succour of his coursers golden-rein'd. Save me, my brother! Pity me! Thy steeds Give me, that they may bear me to the heights Olympian, seat of the immortal Gods! Oh! I am wounded deep; a mortal man Hath done it, Diomede; nor would he fear This day in fight the Sire himself of all. Then Mars his coursers gold-caparison'd Resign'd to Venus; she, with countenance sad, The chariot climb'd, and Iris at her side The bright reins seizing lash'd the ready steeds. Soon as the Olympian heights, seat of the Gods They reach'd, wing-footed Iris loosing quick The coursers, gave them large whereon to browse Ambrosial food; but Venus on the knees Sank of Dione, who with folded arms Maternal, to her bosom straining close Her daughter, stroked her cheek, and thus enquired. My darling child! who? which of all the Gods Hath rashly done such violence to thee As if convicted of some open wrong? Her then the Goddess of love-kindling smiles Venus thus answer'd; Diomede the proud, Audacious Diomede; he gave the wound, For that I stole Æneas from the fight My son, of all mankind my most beloved; Nor is it now the war of Greece with Troy, But of the Greecians with the Gods themselves. Then thus Dione, Goddess all divine. My child! how hard soe'er thy sufferings seem Endure them patiently. Full many a wrong From human hands profane the Gods endure, And many a painful stroke, mankind from ours. Mars once endured much wrong, when on a time Him Otus bound and Ephialtes fast, Sons of Alöeus, and full thirteen moons In brazen thraldom held him. There, at length, The fierce blood-nourished Mars had pined away, But that Eëribœa, loveliest nymph, His step-mother, in happy hour disclosed To Mercury the story of his wrongs; He stole the prisoner forth, but with his woes Already worn, languid and fetter-gall'd. Nor Juno less endured, when erst the bold Son of Amphytrion with tridental shaft Her bosom pierced; she then the misery felt Of irremediable pain severe. Nor suffer'd Pluto less, of all the Gods Gigantic most, by the same son of Jove Alcides, at the portals of the dead Transfix'd and fill'd with anguish; he the house Of Jove and the Olympian summit sought Dejected, torture-stung, for sore the shaft Oppress'd him, into his huge shoulder driven. But Pæon him not liable to death With unction smooth of salutiferous balms Heal'd soon. Presumptuous, sacrilegious man! Careless what dire enormities he wrought, Who bent his bow against the powers of heaven! But blue-eyed Pallas instigated him By whom thou bleed'st. Infatuate! he forgets That whoso turns against the Gods his arms Lives never long; he never, safe escaped From furious fight, the lisp'd caresses hears Of his own infants prattling at his knees. Let therefore Diomede beware, lest strong And valiant as he is, he chance to meet Some mightier foe than thou, and lest his wife, Daughter of King Adrastus, the discrete Ægialea, from portentous dreams Upstarting, call her family to wail Her first-espoused, Achaia's proudest boast, Diomede, whom she must behold no more. She said, and from her wrist with both hands wiped The trickling ichor; the effectual touch Divine chased all her pains, and she was heal'd. Them Juno mark'd and Pallas, and with speech Sarcastic pointed at Saturnian Jove To vex him, blue-eyed Pallas thus began. Eternal father! may I speak my thought, And not incense thee, Jove? I can but judge That Venus, while she coax'd some Greecian fair To accompany the Trojans whom she loves With such extravagance, hath heedless stroaked Her golden clasps, and scratch'd her lily hand. So she; then smiled the sire of Gods and men, And calling golden Venus, her bespake. War and the tented field, my beauteous child, Are not for thee. Thou rather shouldst be found In scenes of matrimonial bliss. The toils Of war to Pallas and to Mars belong. Thus they in heaven. But Diomede the while Sprang on Æneas, conscious of the God Whose hand o'ershadow'd him, yet even him Regarding lightly; for he burn'd to slay Æneas, and to seize his glorious arms. Thrice then he sprang impetuous to the deed, And thrice Apollo with his radiant shield Repulsed him. But when ardent as a God The fourth time he advanced, with thundering voice Him thus the Archer of the skies rebuked. Think, and retire, Tydides! nor affect Equality with Gods; for not the same Our nature is and theirs who tread the ground. He spake, and Diomede a step retired, Not more; the anger of the Archer-God Declining slow, and with a sullen awe. Then Phœbus, far from all the warrior throng To his own shrine the sacred dome beneath Of Pergamus, Æneas bore; there him Latona and shaft-arm'd Diana heal'd And glorified within their spacious fane. Meantime the Archer of the silver bow A visionary form prepared; it seem'd Himself Æneas, and was arm'd as he. At once, in contest for that airy form, Grecians and Trojans on each other's breasts The bull-hide buckler batter'd and light targe. Then thus Apollo to the warrior God. Gore-tainted, homicide, town-batterer Mars! Wilt thou not meet and from the fight withdraw This man Tydides, now so fiery grown That he would even cope with Jove himself? First Venus' hand he wounded, and assail'd Impetuous as a God, next, even me. He ceased, and on the topmost turret sat Of Pergamus. Then all-destroyer Mars Ranging the Trojan host, rank after rank Exhorted loud, and in the form assumed Of Acamas the Thracian leader bold, The Godlike sons of Priam thus harangued. Ye sons of Priam, monarch Jove-beloved! How long permit ye your Achaian foes To slay the people?—till the battle rage (Push'd home to Ilium) at her solid gates? Behold—a Chief disabled lies, than whom We reverence not even Hector more, Æneas; fly, save from the roaring storm The noble Anchisiades your friend. He said; then every heart for battle glow'd; And thus Sarpedon with rebuke severe Upbraiding generous Hector, stern began. Where is thy courage, Hector? for thou once Hadst courage. Is it fled? In other days Thy boast hath been that without native troops Or foreign aids, thy kindred and thyself Alone, were guard sufficient for the town. But none of all thy kindred now appears; I can discover none; they stand aloof Quaking, as dogs that hear the lion's roar. We bear the stress, who are but Troy's allies; Myself am such, and from afar I came; For Lycia lies far distant on the banks Of the deep-eddied Xanthus. There a wife I left and infant son, both dear to me, With plenteous wealth, the wish of all who want. Yet urge I still my Lycians, and am prompt Myself to fight, although possessing here Nought that the Greeks can carry or drive hence. But there stand'st thou, neither employ'd thyself, Nor moving others to an active part For all their dearest pledges. Oh beware! Lest, as with meshes of an ample net, At one huge draught the Greecians sweep you all, And desolate at once your populous Troy! By day, by night, thoughts such as these should still Thy conduct influence, and from Chief to Chief Of the allies should send thee, praying each To make firm stand, all bickerings put away. So spake Sarpedon, and his reprimand Stung Hector; instant to the ground he leap'd All arm'd, and shaking his bright spears his host Ranged in all quarters animating loud His legions, and rekindling horrid war. Then, rolling back, the powers of Troy opposed Once more the Greecians, whom the Greecians dense Expected, unretreating, void of fear. As flies the chaff wide scatter'd by the wind O'er all the consecrated floor, what time Ripe Ceres with brisk airs her golden grain Ventilates, whitening with its husk the ground; So grew the Achaians white, a dusty cloud Descending on their arms, which steeds with steeds Again to battle mingling, with their hoofs Up-stamp'd into the brazen vault of heaven; For now the charioteers turn'd all to fight. Host toward host with full collected force They moved direct. Then Mars through all the field Took wide his range, and overhung the war With night, in aid of Troy, at the command Of Phœbus of the golden sword; for he Perceiving Pallas from the field withdrawn, Patroness of the Greeks, had Mars enjoin'd To rouse the spirit of the Trojan host. Meantime Apollo from his unctuous shrine Sent forth restored and with new force inspired Æneas. He amidst his warriors stood, Who him with joy beheld still living, heal'd, And all his strength possessing unimpair'd. Yet no man ask'd him aught. No leisure now For question was; far other thoughts had they; Such toils the archer of the silver bow, Wide-slaughtering Mars, and Discord as at first Raging implacable, for them prepared. Ulysses, either Ajax, Diomede,— These roused the Greeks to battle, who themselves The force fear'd nothing, or the shouts of Troy, But steadfast stood, like clouds by Jove amass'd On lofty mountains, while the fury sleeps Of Boreas, and of all the stormy winds Shrill-voiced, that chase the vapours when they blow. So stood the Greeks, expecting firm the approach Of Ilium's powers, and neither fled nor fear'd. Then Agamemnon the embattled host On all sides ranging, cheer'd them. Now, he cried, Be steadfast, fellow warriors, now be men! Hold fast a sense of honour. More escape Of men who fear disgrace, than fall in fight, While dastards forfeit life and glory both. He said, and hurl'd his spear. He pierced a friend Of brave Æneas, warring in the van, Deicöon son of Pergasus, in Troy Not less esteem'd than Priam's sons themselves, Such was his fame in foremost fight acquired. Him Agamemnon on his buckler smote, Nor stayed the weapon there, but through his belt His bowels enter'd, and with hideous clang And outcry Vide Samson to Harapha in the Agonistes. There the word is used in the same sense. of his batter'd arms he fell. Æneas next two mightiest warriors slew, Sons of Diocles, of a wealthy sire, Whose house magnificent in Phæræ stood, Orsilochus and Crethon. Their descent From broad-stream'd Alpheus, Pylian flood, they drew. Alpheus begat Orsilochus, a prince Of numerous powers. Orsilochus begat Warlike Diocles. From Diocles sprang Twins, Crethon and Orsilochus, alike Valiant, and skilful in all forms of war. Their boyish prime scarce past, they, with the Greeks Embarking, in their sable ships had sail'd To steed-famed Ilium; just revenge they sought For Atreus' sons, but perished first themselves. As two young lions, in the deep recess Of some dark forest on the mountain's brow Late nourished by their dam, forth-issuing, seize The fatted flocks and kine, both folds and stalls Wasting rapacious, till, at length, themselves Deep-wounded perish by the hand of man, So they, both vanquish'd by Æneas, fell, And like two lofty pines uprooted, lay. Them fallen in battle Menelaus saw With pity moved; radiant in arms he shook His brazen spear, and strode into the van. Mars urged him furious on, conceiving hope Of his death also by Æneas' hand. But him the son of generous Nestor mark'd Antilochus, and to the foremost fight Flew also, fearing lest some dire mischance The Prince befalling, at one fatal stroke Should frustrate all the labours of the Greeks. They, hand to hand, and spear to spear opposed, Stood threatening dreadful onset, when beside The Spartan chief Antilochus appear'd. Æneas, at the sight of two combined, Stood not, although intrepid. They the dead Thence drawing far into the Greecian host To their associates gave the hapless pair, Then, both returning, fought in front again. Next, fierce as Mars, Pylæmenes they slew, Prince of the shielded band magnanimous Of Paphlagonia. Him Atrides kill'd Spear-practised Menelaus, with a lance His throat transpiercing while erect he rode. Then, while his charioteer, Mydon the brave, Son of Atymnias, turn'd his steeds to flight, Full on his elbow-point Antilochus, The son of Nestor, dash'd him with a stone. The slack reins, white as ivory This is a construction of ???? ????????, given by some of the best commentators, and that seems the most probable., forsook His torpid hand and trail'd the dust. At once Forth sprang Antilochus, and with his sword Hew'd deep his temples. On his head he pitch'd Panting, and on his shoulders in the sand (For in deep sand he fell) stood long erect, Till his own coursers spread him in the dust; The son of Nestor seized, and with his scourge Drove them afar into the host of Greece. Them Hector through the ranks espying, flew With clamour loud to meet them; after whom Advanced in phalanx firm the powers of Troy. Mars led them, with Enyo terror-clad; She by the maddening tumult of the fight Attended, he, with his enormous spear In both hands brandish'd, stalking now in front Of Hector, and now following his steps. Him Diomede the bold discerning, felt Himself no small dismay; and as a man Wandering he knows not whither, far from home, If chance a rapid torrent to the sea Borne headlong thwart his course, the foaming flood Obstreperous views awhile, then quick retires, So he, and his attendants thus bespake. How oft, my countrymen! have we admired The noble Hector, skillful at the spear And unappall'd in fight? but still hath he Some God his guard, and even now I view In human form Mars moving at his side. Ye, then, with faces to the Trojans turn'd, Ceaseless retire, and war not with the Gods. He ended; and the Trojans now approach'd. Then two bold warriors in one chariot borne, By valiant Hector died, Menesthes, one, And one, Anchialus. Them fallen in fight Ajax the vast, touch'd with compassion saw; Within small space he stood, his glittering spear Dismiss'd, and pierced Amphius. Son was he Of Selagus, and Pæsus was his home, Where opulent he dwelt, but by his fate Was led to fight for Priam and his sons. Him Telamonian Ajax through his belt Wounded, and in his nether bowels deep Fix'd his long-shadow'd spear. Sounding he fell. Illustrious Ajax running to the slain Prepared to strip his arms, but him a shower Of glittering weapons keen from Trojan hands Assail'd, and numerous his broad shield received. He, on the body planting firm his heel, Forth drew the polish'd spear, but his bright arms Took not, by darts thick-flying sore annoy'd. Nor fear'd he little lest his haughty foes, Spear-arm'd and bold, should compass him around; Him, therefore, valiant though he were and huge, They push'd before them. Staggering he retired. Thus toil'd both hosts in that laborious field. And now his ruthless destiny impell'd Tlepolemus, Alcides' son, a Chief Dauntless and huge, against a Godlike foe Sarpedon. They approaching, face to face Stood, son and grandson of high-thundering Jove, And, haughty, thus Tlepolemus began. Sarpedon, leader of the Lycian host, Thou trembler! thee what cause could hither urge A man unskill'd in arms? They falsely speak Who call thee son of Ægis-bearing Jove, So far below their might thou fall'st who sprang From Jove in days of old. What says report Of Hercules, (for him I boast my sire,) All-daring hero with a lion's heart? With six ships only, and with followers few, He for the horses of Laomedon Lay'd Troy in dust, and widow'd all her streets. But thou art base, and thy diminish'd powers Perish around thee; think not that thou camest For Ilium's good, but rather, whatsoe'er Thy force in fight, to find, subdued by me, A sure dismission to the gates of hell. To whom the leader of the Lycian band. Tlepolemus! he ransack'd sacred Troy, As thou hast said, but for her monarch's fault Laomedon, who him with language harsh Requited ill for benefits received, Nor would the steeds surrender, seeking which He voyaged from afar. But thou shalt take Thy bloody doom from this victorious arm, And, vanquish'd by my spear, shalt yield thy fame To me, thy soul to Pluto steed-renown'd. So spake Sarpedon, and his ashen beam Tlepolemus upraised. Both hurl'd at once Their quivering spears. Sarpedon's through the neck Pass'd of Tlepolemus, and show'd beyond Its ruthless point; thick darkness veil'd his eyes. Tlepolemus with his long lance the thigh Pierced of Sarpedon; sheer into his bone He pierced him, but Sarpedon's father, Jove, Him rescued even on the verge of fate. His noble friends conducted from the field The godlike Lycian, trailing as he went The pendent spear, none thinking to extract For his relief the weapon from his thigh, Through eagerness of haste to bear him thence. On the other side, the Greecians brazen-mail'd Bore off Tlepolemus. Ulysses fill'd With earnest thoughts tumultuous them observed, Danger-defying Chief! Doubtful he stood Or to pursue at once the Thunderer's son Sarpedon, or to take more Lycian lives. But not for brave Ulysses had his fate That praise reserved, that he should slay the son Renown'd of Jove; therefore his wavering mind Minerva bent against the Lycian band. Then Cœranus, Alastor, Chromius fell, Alcander, Halius, Prytanis, and brave Noëmon; nor had these sufficed the Chief Of Ithaca, but Lycians more had fallen, Had not crest-tossing Hector huge perceived The havoc; radiant to the van he flew, Filling with dread the Greecians; his approach Sarpedon, son of Jove, joyful beheld, And piteous thus address'd him as he came. Ah, leave not me, Priamides! a prey To Greecian hands, but in your city, at least, Grant me to die: since hither, doom'd, I came Never to gratify with my return To Lycia, my loved spouse, or infant child. He spake; but Hector unreplying pass'd Impetuous, ardent to repulse the Greeks That moment, and to drench his sword in blood. Then, under shelter of a spreading beech Sacred to Jove, his noble followers placed The godlike Chief Sarpedon, where his friend Illustrious Pelagon, the ashen spear Extracted. Sightless, of all thought bereft, He sank, but soon revived, by breathing airs Refresh'd, that fann'd him gently from the North. Meantime the Argives, although press'd alike By Mars himself and Hector brazen-arm'd, Neither to flight inclined, nor yet advanced To battle, but inform'd that Mars the fight Waged on the side of Ilium, slow retired. Whom first, whom last slew then the mighty son Of Priam, Hector, and the brazen Mars! First godlike Teuthras, an equestrian Chief, Orestes, Trechus of Ætolian race, Œnomaüs, Helenus from Œnops' sprung, And brisk This, according to Porphyrius as quoted by Clarke, is the true meaning of ???????????. in fight Oresbius; rich was he, And covetous of more in Hyla dwelt Fast by the lake Cephissus, where abode Bœotian Princes numerous, rich themselves And rulers of a people wealth-renown'd. But Juno, such dread slaughter of the Greeks Noting, thus, ardent, to Minerva spake. Daughter of Jove invincible! Our word That Troy shall perish, hath been given in vain To Menelaus, if we suffer Mars To ravage longer uncontroul'd. The time Urges, and need appears that we ourselves Now call to mind the fury of our might. She spake; nor blue-eyed Pallas not complied. Then Juno, Goddess dread, from Saturn sprung, Her coursers gold-caparison'd prepared Impatient. Hebe to the chariot roll'd The brazen wheels, and joined them to the smooth Steel axle; twice four spokes divided each Shot from the centre to the verge. The verge Was gold by fellies of eternal brass Guarded, a dazzling show! The shining naves Were silver; silver cords and cords of gold The seat upbore; two crescents These which I have called crescents, were a kind of hook of a semicircular form, to which the reins were occasionally fastened. blazed in front. The pole was argent all, to which she bound The golden yoke, and in their place disposed The breast-bands incorruptible of gold; But Juno to the yoke, herself, the steeds Led forth, on fire to reach the dreadful field. Meantime, Minerva, progeny of Jove, On the adamantine floor of his abode Let fall profuse her variegated robe, Labour of her own hands. She first put on The corslet of the cloud-assembler God, Then arm'd her for the field of woe complete. She charged her shoulder with the dreadful shield The shaggy Ægis, border'd thick around With terror; there was Discord, Prowess there, There hot Pursuit, and there the feature grim Of Gorgon, dire Deformity, a sign Oft borne portentous on the arm of Jove. Her golden helm, whose concave had sufficed The legions of an hundred cities, rough With warlike ornament superb, she fix'd On her immortal head. Thus arm'd, she rose Into the flaming chariot, and her spear Seized ponderous, huge, with which the Goddess sprung From an Almighty father, levels ranks Of heroes, against whom her anger burns. Juno with lifted lash urged quick the steeds; At her approach, spontaneous roar'd the wide- Unfolding gates of heaven; the heavenly gates Kept by the watchful Hours, to whom the charge Of the Olympian summit appertains, And of the boundless ether, back to roll, And to replace the cloudy barrier dense. Spurr'd through the portal flew the rapid steeds; Apart from all, and seated on the point Superior of the cloven mount, they found The Thunderer. Juno the white-arm'd her steeds There stay'd, and thus the Goddess, ere she pass'd, Question'd the son of Saturn, Jove supreme. Jove, Father, seest thou, and art not incensed, These ravages of Mars? Oh what a field, Drench'd with what Greecian blood! All rashly spilt, And in despite of me. Venus, the while, Sits, and the Archer of the silver bow Delighted, and have urged, themselves, to this The frantic Mars within no bounds confined Of law or order. But, eternal sire! Shall I offend thee chasing far away Mars deeply smitten from the field of war? To whom the cloud-assembler God replied. Go! but exhort thou rather to the task Spoil-huntress Athenæan Pallas, him Accustom'd to chastise with pain severe. He spake, nor white-arm'd Juno not obey'd. She lash'd her steeds; they readily their flight Began, the earth and starry vault between. Far as from his high tower the watchman kens O'er gloomy ocean, so far at one bound Advance the shrill-voiced coursers of the Gods. But when at Troy and at the confluent streams Of Simoïs and Scamander they arrived, There Juno, white-arm'd Goddess, from the yoke Her steeds releasing, them in gather'd shades Conceal'd opaque, while Simoïs caused to spring Ambrosia from his bank, whereon they browsed. Swift as her pinions waft the dove away They sought the Greecians, ardent to begin: Arriving where the mightiest and the most Compass'd equestrian Diomede around, In aspect lion-like, or like wild boars Of matchless force, there white-arm'd Juno stood, And in the form of Stentor for his voice Of brass renown'd, audible as the roar Of fifty throats, the Greecians thus harangued. Oh shame, shame, shame! Argives in form alone, Beautiful but dishonourable race! While yet divine Achilles ranged the field, No Trojan stepp'd from yon Dardanian gates Abroad; all trembled at his stormy spear; But now they venture forth, now at your ships Defy you, from their city far remote. She ceased, and all caught courage from the sound. But Athenæan Pallas eager sought The son of Tydeus; at his chariot side She found the Chief cooling his fiery wound Received from Pandarus; for him the sweat Beneath the broad band of his oval shield Exhausted, and his arm fail'd him fatigued; He therefore raised the band and wiped the blood Coagulate; when o'er his chariot yoke Her arm the Goddess threw, and thus began. Tydeus, in truth, begat a son himself Not much resembling. Tydeus was of size Diminutive, but had a warrior's heart. When him I once commanded to abstain From furious fight (what time he enter'd Thebes Ambassador, and the Cadmeans found Feasting, himself the sole Achaian there) And bade him quietly partake the feast, He, fired with wonted ardour, challenged forth To proof of manhood the Cadmean youth, Whom easily, through my effectual aid, In contests of each kind he overcame. But thou, whom I encircle with my power, Guard vigilant, and even bid thee forth To combat with the Trojans, thou, thy limbs Feelst wearied with the toils of war, or worse, Indulgest womanish and heartless fear. Henceforth thou art not worthy to be deem'd Son of Oenides, Tydeus famed in arms. To whom thus valiant Diomede replied. I know thee well, oh Goddess sprung from Jove! And therefore willing shall, and plain, reply. Me neither weariness nor heartless fear Restrains, but thine injunctions which impress My memory, still, that I should fear to oppose The blessed Gods in fight, Venus except, Whom in the battle found thou badest me pierce With unrelenting spear; therefore myself Retiring hither, I have hither call'd The other Argives also, for I know That Mars, himself in arms, controuls the war. Him answer'd then the Goddess azure-eyed. Tydides! Diomede, my heart's delight! Fear not this Mars ???? ?????., nor fear thou other power Immortal, but be confident in me. Arise. Drive forth. Seek Mars; him only seek; Him hand to hand engage; this fiery Mars Respect not aught, base implement of wrong And mischief, shifting still from side to side. He promised Juno lately and myself That he would fight for Greece, yet now forgets His promise, and gives all his aid to Troy. So saying, she backward by his hand withdrew The son of Capaneus, who to the ground Leap'd instant; she, impatient to his place Ascending, sat beside brave Diomede. Loud groan'd the beechen axle, under weight Unwonted, for it bore into the fight An awful Goddess, and the chief of men. Quick-seizing lash and reins Minerva drove Direct at Mars. That moment he had slain Periphas, bravest of Ætolia's sons, And huge of bulk; Ochesius was his sire. Him Mars the slaughterer had of life bereft Newly, and Pallas to elude his sight The helmet fixed of Ades on her head. Soon as gore-tainted Mars the approach perceived Of Diomede, he left the giant length Of Periphas extended where he died, And flew to cope with Tydeus' valiant son. Full nigh they came, when Mars on fire to slay The hero, foremost with his brazen lance Assail'd him, hurling o'er his horses' heads. But Athenæan Pallas in her hand The flying weapon caught and turn'd it wide, Baffling his aim. Then Diomede on him Rush'd furious in his turn, and Pallas plunged The bright spear deep into his cinctured waist. Dire was the wound, and plucking back the spear She tore him. Bellow'd brazen-throated Mars Loud as nine thousand warriors, or as ten Join'd in close combat. Greecians, Trojans shook Appall'd alike at the tremendous voice Of Mars insatiable with deeds of blood. Such as the dimness is when summer winds Breathe hot, and sultry mist obscures the sky, Such brazen Mars to Diomede appear'd By clouds accompanied in his ascent Into the boundless ether. Reaching soon The Olympian heights, seat of the Gods, he sat Beside Saturnian Jove; woe fill'd his heart; He show'd fast-streaming from the wound his blood Immortal, and impatient thus complain'd. Jove, Father! Seest thou these outrageous acts Unmoved with anger? Such are day by day The dreadful mischiefs by the Gods contrived Against each other, for the sake of man. Thou art thyself the cause. Thou hast produced A foolish daughter petulant, addict To evil only and injurious deeds; There is not in Olympus, save herself, Who feels not thy control; but she her will Gratifies ever, and reproof from thee Finds none, because, pernicious as she is, She is thy daughter. She hath now the mind Of haughty Diomede with madness fill'd Against the immortal Gods; first Venus bled; Her hand he pierced impetuous, then assail'd, As if himself immortal, even me. But me my feet stole thence, or overwhelm'd Beneath yon heaps of carcases impure, What had I not sustain'd? And if at last I lived, had halted crippled by the sword. To whom with dark displeasure Jove replied. Base and side-shifting traitor! vex not me Here sitting querulous; of all who dwell On the Olympian heights, thee most I hate Contentious, whose delight is war alone. Thou hast thy mother's moods, the very spleen Of Juno, uncontroulable as she, Whom even I, reprove her as I may, Scarce rule by mere commands; I therefore judge Thy sufferings a contrivance all her own. But soft. Thou art my son whom I begat, And Juno bare thee. I cannot endure That thou shouldst suffer long. Hadst thou been born Of other parents thus detestable, What Deity soe'er had brought thee forth, Thou shouldst have found long since an humbler sphere. He ceased, and to the care his son consign'd Of Pæon; he with drugs of lenient powers, Soon heal'd whom immortality secured From dissolution. As the juice from figs Express'd what fluid was in milk before Coagulates, stirr'd rapidly around, So soon was Mars by Pæon's skill restored. Him Hebe bathed, and with divine attire Graceful adorn'd; when at the side of Jove Again his glorious seat sublime he took. Meantime to the abode of Jove supreme Ascended Juno throughout Argos known And mighty Pallas; Mars the plague of man, By their successful force from slaughter driven. BOOK VI. ARGUMENT OF THE SIXTH BOOK. The battle is continued. The Trojans being closely pursued, Hector by the advice of Helenus enters Troy, and recommends it to Hecuba to go in solemn procession to the temple of Minerva; she with the matrons goes accordingly. Hector takes the opportunity to find out Paris, and exhorts him to return to the field of battle. An interview succeeds between Hector and Andromache, and Paris, having armed himself in the meantime, comes up with Hector at the close of it, when they sally from the gate together. Thus was the field forsaken by the Gods. And now success proved various; here the Greeks With their extended spears, the Trojans there Prevail'd alternate, on the champain spread The Xanthus and the Simoïs between. First Telamonian Ajax, bulwark firm Of the Achaians, broke the Trojan ranks, And kindled for the Greeks a gleam of hope, Slaying the bravest of the Thracian band, Huge Acamas, Eusorus' son; him first Full on the shaggy crest he smote, and urged The spear into his forehead; through his scull The bright point pass'd, and darkness veil'd his eyes. But Diomede, heroic Chief, the son Of Teuthras slew, Axylus. Rich was he, And in Arisba, (where he dwelt beside The public road, and at his open door Made welcome all,) respected and beloved. But of his numerous guests none interposed To avert his woeful doom; nor him alone He slew, but with him also to the shades Calesius sent, his friend and charioteer. Opheltius fell and Dresus, by the hand Slain of Euryalus, who, next, his arms On Pedasus and on Æsepus turned Brethren and twins. Them Abarbarea bore, A Naiad, to Bucolion, son renown'd Of King Laomedon, his eldest born, But by his mother, at his birth, conceal'd. Bucolion pasturing his flocks, embraced The lovely nymph; she twins produced, both whom, Brave as they were and beautiful, thy son Euryalus. Mecisteus! slew, and from their shoulders tore Their armour. Dauntless Polypœtes slew Astyalus. Ulysses with his spear Transfixed Pydites, a Percosian Chief, And Teucer Aretaön; Nestor's pride Antilochus, with his bright lance, of life Bereft Ablerus, and the royal arm Of Agamemnon, Elatus; he dwelt Among the hills of lofty Pedasus, On Satnio's banks, smooth-sliding river pure. Phylacus fled, whom Leïtus as swift Soon smote. Melanthius at the feet expired Of the renowned Eurypylus, and, flush'd With martial ardour, Menelaus seized And took alive Adrastus. As it chanced A thicket his affrighted steeds detain'd Their feet entangling; they with restive force At its extremity snapp'd short the pole, And to the city, whither others fled, Fled also. From his chariot headlong hurl'd, Adrastus press'd the plain fast by his wheel. Flew Menelaus, and his quivering spear Shook over him; he, life imploring, clasp'd Importunate his knees, and thus exclaim'd. Oh, son of Atreus, let me live! accept Illustrious ransom! In my father's house Is wealth abundant, gold, and brass, and steel Of truest temper, which he will impart Till he have gratified thine utmost wish, Inform'd that I am captive in your fleet. He said, and Menelaus by his words Vanquish'd, him soon had to the fleet dismiss'd Given to his train in charge, but swift and stern Approaching, Agamemnon interposed.— Now, brother, whence this milkiness of mind, These scruples about blood? Thy Trojan friends Have doubtless much obliged thee. Die the race! May none escape us! Neither he who flies, Nor even the infant in his mother's womb Unconscious. Perish universal Troy Unpitied, till her place be found no more! So saying, his brother's mind the Hero turn'd, Advising him aright; he with his hand Thrust back Adrastus, and himself, the King, His bowels pierced. Supine Adrastus fell, And Agamemnon, with his foot the corse Impressing firm, pluck'd forth his ashen spear. Then Nestor, raising high his voice, exclaim'd. Friends, Heroes, Greecians, ministers of Mars! Let none, desirous of the spoil, his time Devote to plunder now; now slay your foes, And strip them when the field shall be your own. He said, and all took courage at his word. Then had the Trojans enter'd Troy again By the heroic Greecians foul repulsed, So was their spirit daunted, but the son Of Priam, Helenus, an augur far Excelling all, at Hector's side his speech To him and to Æneas thus address'd. Hector, and thou, Æneas, since on you The Lycians chiefly and ourselves depend, For that in difficult emprize ye show Most courage; give best counsel; stand yourselves, And, visiting all quarters, cause to stand Before the city-gates our scatter'd troops, Ere yet the fugitives within the arms Be slaughter'd of their wives, the scorn of Greece. When thus ye shall have rallied every band And roused their courage, weary though we be, Yet since necessity commands, even here Will we give battle to the host of Greece. But, Hector! to the city thou depart; There charge our mother, that she go direct, With the assembled matrons, to the fane Of Pallas in the citadel of Troy. Opening her chambers' sacred doors, of all Her treasured mantles there, let her select The widest, most magnificently wrought, And which she values most; that let her spread On Athenæan Pallas' lap divine. Twelve heifers of the year yet never touch'd With puncture of the goad, let her alike Devote to her, if she will pity Troy, Our wives and little ones, and will avert The son of Tydeus from these sacred towers, That dreadful Chief, terror of all our host, Bravest, in my account, of all the Greeks. For never yet Achilles hath himself So taught our people fear, although esteem'd Son of a Goddess. But this warrior's rage Is boundless, and his strength past all compare. So Helenus; nor Hector not complied. Down from his chariot instant to the ground All arm'd he leap'd, and, shaking his sharp spears, Through every phalanx pass'd, rousing again Their courage, and rekindling horrid war. They, turning, faced the Greeks; the Greeks repulsed, Ceased from all carnage, nor supposed they less Than that some Deity, the starry skies Forsaken, help'd their foes, so firm they stood. But Hector to the Trojans call'd aloud. Ye dauntless Trojans and confederate powers Call'd from afar! now be ye men, my friends, Now summon all the fury of your might! I go to charge our senators and wives That they address the Gods with prayers and vows For our success, and hecatombs devote. So saying the Hero went, and as he strode The sable hide that lined his bossy shield Smote on his neck and on his ancle-bone. And now into the middle space between Both hosts, the son of Tydeus and the son Moved of Hippolochus, intent alike On furious combat; face to face they stood, And thus heroic Diomede began. Most noble Champion! who of human kind Art thou, whom in the man-ennobling fight I now encounter first? Past all thy peers I must esteem thee valiant, who hast dared To meet my coming, and my spear defy. Ah! they are sons of miserable sires Who dare my might; but if a God from heaven Thou come, behold! I fight not with the Gods. That war Lycurgus son of Dryas waged, And saw not many years. The nurses he Of brain-disturbing Bacchus down the steep Pursued of sacred Nyssa; they their wands Vine-wreathed cast all away, with an ox-goad Chastised by fell Lycurgus. Bacchus plunged Meantime dismay'd into the Deep, where him Trembling, and at the Hero's haughty threats Confounded, Thetis in her bosom hid. Thus by Lycurgus were the blessed powers Of heaven offended, and Saturnian Jove Of sight bereaved him, who not long that loss Survived, for he was curst by all above. I, therefore, wage no contest with the Gods; But if thou be of men, and feed on bread Of earthly growth, draw nigh, that with a stroke Well-aim'd, I may at once cut short thy days. To whom the illustrious Lycian Chief replied. Why asks brave Diomede of my descent? For, as the leaves, such is the race of man. The wind shakes down the leaves, the budding grove Soon teems with others, and in spring they grow. So pass mankind. One generation meets Its destined period, and a new succeeds. But since thou seem'st desirous to be taught My pedigree, whereof no few have heard, Know that in Argos, in the very lap Of Argos, for her steed-grazed meadows famed, Stands Ephyra; there Sisyphus abode, Shrewdest of human kind; Sisyphus, named Æolides. Himself a son begat, Glaucus, and he Bellerophon, to whom The Gods both manly force and beauty gave. Him Prœtus, (for in Argos at that time Prœtus was sovereign, to whose sceptre Jove Had subjected the land,) plotting his death, Contrived to banish from his native home. For fair Anteia, wife of Prœtus, mad Through love of young Bellerophon, him oft In secret to illicit joys enticed; But she prevail'd not o'er the virtuous mind Discrete of whom she wooed; therefore a lie Framing, she royal Prœtus thus bespake. Die thou, or slay Bellerophon, who sought Of late to force me to his lewd embrace. So saying, the anger of the King she roused. Slay him himself he would not, for his heart Forbad the deed; him therefore he dismiss'd To Lycia, charged with tales of dire import Written in tablets, which he bade him show, That he might perish, to Anteia's sire. To Lycia then, conducted by the Gods, He went, and on the shores of Xanthus found Free entertainment noble at the hands Of Lycia's potent King. Nine days complete He feasted him, and slew each day an ox. But when the tenth day's ruddy morn appear'd, He asked him then his errand, and to see Those written tablets from his son-in-law. The letters seen, he bade him, first, destroy Chimæra, deem'd invincible, divine In nature, alien from the race of man, Lion in front, but dragon all behind, And in the midst a she-goat breathing forth Profuse the violence of flaming fire. Her, confident in signs from heaven, he slew. Next, with the men of Solymæ he fought, Brave warriors far-renown'd, with whom he waged, In his account, the fiercest of his wars. And lastly, when in battle he had slain The man-resisting Amazons, the king Another stratagem at his return Devised against him, placing close-conceal'd An ambush for him from the bravest chosen In Lycia; but they saw their homes no more; Bellerophon the valiant slew them all. The monarch hence collecting, at the last, His heavenly origin, him there detain'd, And gave him his own daughter, with the half Of all his royal dignity and power. The Lycians also, for his proper use, Large lot assigned him of their richest soil, Commodious for the vine, or for the plough. And now his consort fair three children bore To bold Bellerophon; Isandrus one, And one, Hippolochus; his youngest born Laodamia was for beauty such That she became a concubine of Jove. She bore Sarpedon of heroic note. But when Bellerophon, at last, himself Had anger'd all the Gods, feeding on grief He roam'd alone the Aleian field, exiled By choice, from every cheerful haunt of man. Mars, thirsty still for blood, his son destroy'd Isandrus, warring with the host renown'd Of Solymæ; and in her wrath divine Diana from her chariot golden-rein'd Laodamia slew. Myself I boast Sprung from Hippolochus; he sent me forth To fight for Troy, charging me much and oft That I should outstrip always all mankind In worth and valour, nor the house disgrace Of my forefathers, heroes without peer In Ephyra, and in Lycia's wide domain. Such is my lineage; such the blood I boast. He ceased. Then valiant Diomede rejoiced. He pitch'd his spear, and to the Lycian Prince In terms of peace and amity replied. Thou art my own hereditary friend, Whose noble Grandsire was the guest of mine. For Oeneus, on a time, full twenty days, Regaled Bellerophon, and pledges fair Of hospitality they interchanged. Oeneus a belt radiant with purple gave To brave Bellerophon, who in return Gave him a golden goblet. Coming forth I left the kind memorial safe at home. A child was I when Tydeus went to Thebes, Where the Achaians perish'd, and of him Hold no remembrance; but henceforth, my friend, Thine host am I in Argos, and thou mine In Lycia, should I chance to sojourn there. We will not clash. Trojans or aids of Troy No few the Gods shall furnish to my spear, Whom I may slaughter; and no want of Greeks On whom to prove thy prowess, thou shalt find. But it were well that an exchange ensued Between us; take mine armour, give me thine, That all who notice us may understand Our patrimonial ?????? ????????. amity and love. So they, and each alighting, hand in hand Stood lock'd, faith promising and firm accord. Then Jove of sober judgement so bereft Infatuate Glaucus that with Tydeus' son He barter'd gold for brass, an hundred beeves In value, for the value small of nine. But Hector at the Scæan gate and beech Meantime arrived, to whose approach the wives And daughters flock'd of Troy, enquiring each The fate of husband, brother, son, or friend. He bade them all with solemn prayer the Gods Seek fervent, for that woe was on the wing. But when he enter'd Priam's palace, built With splendid porticoes, and which within Had fifty chambers lined with polish'd stone, Contiguous all, where Priam's sons reposed And his sons' wives, and where, on the other side, In twelve magnificent chambers also lined With polish'd marble and contiguous all, The sons-in-law of Priam lay beside His spotless daughters, there the mother queen Seeking the chamber of Laodice, Loveliest of all her children, as she went Met Hector. On his hand she hung and said: Why leavest thou, O my son! the dangerous field? I fear that the Achaians (hateful name!) Compass the walls so closely, that thou seek'st Urged by distress the citadel, to lift Thine hands in prayer to Jove? But pause awhile Till I shall bring thee wine, that having pour'd Libation rich to Jove and to the powers Immortal, thou may'st drink and be refresh'd. For wine is mighty to renew the strength Of weary man, and weary thou must be Thyself, thus long defending us and ours. To whom her son majestic thus replied. My mother, whom I reverence! cheering wine Bring none to me, lest I forget my might. I fear, beside, with unwash'd hands to pour Libation forth of sable wine to Jove, And dare on none account, thus blood-defiled, Approach the tempest-stirring God in prayer. Thou, therefore, gathering all our matrons, seek The fane of Pallas, huntress of the spoil, Bearing sweet incense; but from the attire Treasured within thy chamber, first select The amplest robe, most exquisitely wrought, And which thou prizest most,—then spread the gift On Athenæan Pallas' lap divine. Twelve heifers also of the year, untouch'd With puncture of the goad, promise to slay In sacrifice, if she will pity Troy, Our wives and little ones, and will avert The son of Tydeus from these sacred towers, That dreadful Chief, terror of all our host. Go then, my mother, seek the hallowed fane Of the spoil-huntress Deity. I, the while, Seek Paris, and if Paris yet can hear, Shall call him forth. But oh that earth would yawn And swallow him, whom Jove hath made a curse To Troy, to Priam, and to all his house; Methinks, to see him plunged into the shades For ever, were a cure for all my woes. He ceased; the Queen, her palace entering, charged Her maidens; they, incontinent, throughout All Troy convened the matrons, as she bade. Meantime into her wardrobe incense-fumed, Herself descended; there her treasures lay, Works of Sidonian women, whom her son The Godlike Paris, when he cross'd the seas With Jove-begotten Helen, brought to Troy. The most magnificent, and varied most With colours radiant, from the rest she chose For Pallas; vivid as a star it shone, And lowest lay of all. Then forth she went, The Trojan matrons all following her steps. But when the long procession reach'd the fane Of Pallas in the heights of Troy, to them The fair Theano ope'd the portals wide, Daughter of Cisseus, brave Antenor's spouse, And by appointment public, at that time, Priestess of Pallas. All with lifted hands In presence of Minerva wept aloud. Beauteous Theano on the Goddess' lap Then spread the robe, and to the daughter fair Of Jove omnipotent her suit address'd. Goddess ??? ?????. of Goddesses, our city's shield, Adored Minerva, hear! oh! break the lance Of Diomede, and give himself to fall Prone in the dust before the Scæan gate. So will we offer to thee at thy shrine, This day twelve heifers of the year, untouch'd By yoke or goad, if thou wilt pity show To Troy, and save our children and our wives. Such prayer the priestess offer'd, and such prayer All present; whom Minerva heard averse. But Hector to the palace sped meantime Of Alexander, which himself had built, Aided by every architect of name Illustrious then in Troy. Chamber it had, Wide hall, proud dome, and on the heights of Troy Near-neighbouring Hector's house and Priam's stood. There enter'd Hector, Jove-beloved, a spear Its length eleven cubits in his hand, Its glittering head bound with a ring of gold. He found within his chamber whom he sought, Polishing with exactest care his arms Resplendent, shield and hauberk fingering o'er With curious touch, and tampering with his bow. Helen of Argos with her female train Sat occupied, the while, to each in turn Some splendid task assigning. Hector fix'd His eyes on Paris, and him stern rebuked. Thy sullen humours, Paris, are ill-timed. The people perish at our lofty walls; The flames of war have compass'd Troy around And thou hast kindled them; who yet thyself, That slackness show'st which in another seen Thou would'st resent to death. Haste, seek the field This moment, lest, the next, all Ilium blaze. To whom thus Paris graceful as a God. Since, Hector, thou hast charged me with a fault, And not unjustly, I will answer make, And give thou special heed. That here I sit, The cause is sorrow, which I wish'd to sooth In secret, not displeasure or revenge. I tell thee also, that even now my wife Was urgent with me in most soothing terms That I would forth to battle; and myself, Aware that victory oft changes sides, That course prefer. Wait, therefore, thou awhile, 'Till I shall dress me for the fight, or go Thou first, and I will overtake thee soon. He ceased, to whom brave Hector answer none Return'd, when Helen him with lenient speech Accosted mild. My brother! who in me Hast found a sister worthy of thy hate, Authoress of all calamity to Troy, Oh that the winds, the day when I was born, Had swept me out of sight, whirl'd me aloft To some inhospitable mountain-top, Or plunged me in the deep; there I had sunk O'erwhelm'd, and all these ills had never been. But since the Gods would bring these ills to pass I should, at least, some worthier mate have chosen, One not insensible to public shame. But this, oh this, nor hath nor will acquire Hereafter, aught which like discretion shews Or reason, and shall find his just reward. But enter; take this seat; for who as thou Labours, or who hath cause like thee to rue The crime, my brother, for which Heaven hath doom'd Both Paris and my most detested self To be the burthens of an endless song? To whom the warlike Hector huge The bulk of his heroes is a circumstance of which Homer frequently reminds us by the use of the word ?????—and which ought, therefore, by no means to be suppressed. replied. Me bid not, Helen, to a seat, howe'er Thou wish my stay, for thou must not prevail. The Trojans miss me, and myself no less Am anxious to return. But urge in haste This loiterer forth; yea, let him urge himself To overtake me ere I quit the town. For I must home in haste, that I may see My loved Andromache, my infant boy, And my domestics, ignorant if e'er I shall behold them more, or if my fate Ordain me now to fall by Greecian hands. So spake the dauntless hero, and withdrew. But reaching soon his own well-built abode He found not fair Andromache; she stood Lamenting Hector, with the nurse who bore Her infant, on a turret's top sublime. He then, not finding his chaste spouse within, Thus from the portal, of her train enquired. Tell me, ye maidens, whither went from home Andromache the fair? Went she to see Her female kindred of my father's house, Or to Minerva's temple, where convened The bright-hair'd matrons of the city seek To sooth the awful Goddess? Tell me true. To whom his household's governess discrete. Since, Hector, truth is thy demand, receive True answer. Neither went she forth to see Her female kindred of thy father's house, Nor to Minerva's temple, where convened The bright-haired matrons of the city seek To sooth the awful Goddess; but she went Hence to the tower of Troy: for she had heard That the Achaians had prevail'd, and driven The Trojans to the walls; she, therefore, wild With grief, flew thither, and the nurse her steps Attended, with thy infant in her arms. So spake the prudent governess; whose words When Hector heard, issuing from his door He backward trod with hasty steps the streets Of lofty Troy, and having traversed all The spacious city, when he now approach'd The Scæan gate, whence he must seek the field, There, hasting home again his noble wife Met him, Andromache the rich-endow'd Fair daughter of Eëtion famed in arms. Eëtion, who in Hypoplacian Thebes Umbrageous dwelt, Cilicia's mighty lord,— His daughter valiant Hector had espoused. There she encounter'd him, and with herself The nurse came also, bearing in her arms Hectorides, his infant darling boy, Beautiful as a star. Him Hector called Scamandrios, but Astyanax The name signifies, the Chief of the city. all else In Ilium named him, for that Hector's arm Alone was the defence and strength of Troy. The father, silent, eyed his babe, and smiled. Andromache, meantime, before him stood, With streaming cheeks, hung on his hand, and said. Thy own great courage will cut short thy days, My noble Hector! neither pitiest thou Thy helpless infant, or my hapless self, Whose widowhood is near; for thou wilt fall Ere long, assail'd by the whole host of Greece. Then let me to the tomb, my best retreat When thou art slain. For comfort none or joy Can I expect, thy day of life extinct, But thenceforth, sorrow. Father I have none; No mother. When Cilicia's city, Thebes The populous, was by Achilles sack'd, He slew my father; yet his gorgeous arms Stripp'd not through reverence of him, but consumed, Arm'd as it was, his body on the pile, And heap'd his tomb, which the Oreades Mountain nymphs., Jove's daughters, had with elms inclosed around. My seven brothers, glory of our house, All in one day descended to the shades; For brave Achilles, while they fed their herds And snowy flocks together, slew them all. My mother, Queen of the well-wooded realm Of Hypoplacian Thebes, her hither brought Among his other spoils, he loosed again At an inestimable ransom-price, But by Diana Sudden deaths were ascribed either to Diana or Apollo. pierced, she died at home. Yet Hector—oh my husband! I in thee Find parents, brothers, all that I have lost. Come! have compassion on us. Go not hence, But guard this turret, lest of me thou make A widow, and an orphan of thy boy. The city walls are easiest of ascent At yonder fig-tree; station there thy powers; For whether by a prophet warn'd, or taught By search and observation, in that part Each Ajax with Idomeneus of Crete, The sons of Atreus, and the valiant son Of Tydeus, have now thrice assail'd the town. To whom the leader of the host of Troy. These cares, Andromache, which thee engage, All touch me also; but I dread to incur The scorn of male and female tongues in Troy, If, dastard-like, I should decline the fight. Nor feel I such a wish. No. I have learn'd To be courageous ever, in the van Among the flower of Ilium to assert My glorious father's honour, and my own. For that the day shall come when sacred Troy, When Priam, and the people of the old Spear-practised King shall perish, well I know. But for no Trojan sorrows yet to come So much I mourn, not e'en for Hecuba, Nor yet for Priam, nor for all the brave Of my own brothers who shall kiss the dust, As for thyself, when some Achaian Chief Shall have convey'd thee weeping hence, thy sun Of peace and liberty for ever set. Then shalt thou toil in Argos at the loom For a task-mistress, and constrain'd shalt draw From Hypereïa's fount, or from the fount Messeïs, water at her proud command. Some Greecian then, seeing thy tears, shall say— “This was the wife of Hector, who excell'd All Troy in fight when Ilium was besieged.” Such he shall speak thee, and thy heart, the while, Shall bleed afresh through want of such a friend To stand between captivity and thee. But may I rest beneath my hill of earth Or ere that day arrive! I would not live To hear thy cries, and see thee torn away. So saying, illustrious Hector stretch'd his arms Forth to his son, but with a scream, the child Fell back into the bosom of his nurse, His father's aspect dreading, whose bright arms He had attentive mark'd and shaggy crest Playing tremendous o'er his helmet's height. His father and his gentle mother laugh'd The Scholiast in Villoisson calls it ??????? ???? ??? ??????? ?????? a natural and moderate laughter., And noble Hector lifting from his head His dazzling helmet, placed it on the ground, Then kiss'd his boy and dandled him, and thus In earnest prayer the heavenly powers implored. Hear all ye Gods! as ye have given to me, So also on my son excelling might Bestow, with chief authority in Troy. And be his record this, in time to come, When he returns from battle. Lo! how far The son excels the sire! May every foe Fall under him, and he come laden home With spoils blood-stain'd to his dear mother's joy. He said, and gave his infant to the arms Of his Andromache, who him received Into her fragrant bosom, bitter tears With sweet smiles mingling; he with pity moved That sight observed, soft touch'd her cheek, and said, Mourn not, my loved Andromache, for me Too much; no man shall send me to the shades Of Tartarus, ere mine allotted hour, Nor lives he who can overpass the date By heaven assign'd him, be he base or brave. Go then, and occupy content at home The woman's province; ply the distaff, spin And weave, and task thy maidens. War belongs To man; to all men; and of all who first Drew vital breath in Ilium, most to me. He ceased, and from the ground his helmet raised Hair-crested; his Andromache, at once Obedient, to her home repair'd, but oft Turn'd as she went, and, turning, wept afresh. No sooner at the palace she arrived Of havoc-spreading Hector, than among Her numerous maidens found within, she raised A general lamentation; with one voice, In his own house, his whole domestic train Mourn'd Hector, yet alive; for none the hope Conceived of his escape from Greecian hands, Or to behold their living master more. Nor Paris in his stately mansion long Delay'd, but, arm'd resplendent, traversed swift The city, all alacrity and joy. As some stall'd horse high-fed, his stable-cord Snapt short, beats under foot the sounding plain, Accustomed in smooth-sliding streams to lave Exulting; high he bears his head, his mane Undulates o'er his shoulders, pleased he eyes His glossy sides, and borne on pliant knees Shoots to the meadow where his fellows graze; So Paris, son of Priam, from the heights Of Pergamus into the streets of Troy, All dazzling as the sun, descended, flush'd With martial pride, and bounding in his course. At once he came where noble Hector stood Now turning, after conference with his spouse, When godlike Alexander thus began. My hero brother, thou hast surely found My long delay most irksome. More dispatch Had pleased thee more, for such was thy command. To whom the warlike Hector thus replied. No man, judicious, and in feat of arms Intelligent, would pour contempt on thee, (For thou art valiant,) wert thou not remiss And wilful negligent; and when I hear The very men who labour in thy cause Reviling thee, I make thy shame my own. But let us on. All such complaints shall cease Hereafter, and thy faults be touch'd no more, Let Jove but once afford us riddance clear Of these Achaians, and to quaff the cup Of liberty, before the living Gods. BOOK VII. ARGUMENT OF THE SEVENTH BOOK. Ajax and Hector engage in single combat. The Greecians fortify their camp. So saying, illustrious Hector through the gates To battle rush'd, with Paris at his side, And both were bent on deeds of high renown. As when the Gods vouchsafe propitious gales To longing mariners, who with smooth oars Threshing the waves have all their strength consumed, So them the longing Trojans glad received. At once each slew a Greecian. Paris slew Menesthius who in Arna dwelt, the son Of Areithoüs, club-bearing chief, And of Philomedusa radiant-eyed. But Hector wounded with his glittering spear Eïoneus; he pierced his neck beneath His brazen morion's verge, and dead he fell. Then Glaucus, leader of the Lycian host, Son of Hippolochus, in furious fight Iphinoüs son of Dexias assail'd, Mounting his rapid mares, and with his lance His shoulder pierced; unhorsed he fell and died. Such slaughter of the Greecians in fierce fight Minerva noting, from the Olympian hills Flew down to sacred Ilium; whose approach Marking from Pergamus Apollo flew To meet her, ardent on the part of Troy. Beneath the beech they join'd, when first the King, The son of Jove, Apollo, thus began. Daughter of Jove supreme! why hast thou left Olympus, and with such impetuous speed? Comest thou to give the Danaï success Decisive? For I know that pity none Thou feel'st for Trojans, perish as they may. But if advice of mine can influence thee To that which shall be best, let us compose This day the furious fight, which shall again Hereafter rage, till Ilium be destroy'd. Since such is Juno's pleasure and thy own. Him answer'd then Pallas cærulean-eyed. Celestial archer! be it so. I came Myself so purposing into the field From the Olympian heights. But by what means Wilt thou induce the warriors to a pause? To whom the King, the son of Jove, replied. The courage of equestrian Hector bold Let us excite, that he may challenge forth To single conflict terrible some chief Achaian. The Achaians brazen-mail'd Indignant, will supply a champion soon To combat with the noble Chief of Troy. So spake Apollo, and his counsel pleased Minerva; which when Helenus the seer, Priam's own son, in his prophetic soul Perceived, approaching Hector, thus he spake. Jove's peer in wisdom, Hector, Priam's son! I am thy brother. Wilt thou list to me? Bid cease the battle. Bid both armies sit. Call first, thyself, the mightiest of the Greeks To single conflict. I have heard the voice Of the Eternal Gods, and well assured Foretell thee that thy death not now impends. He spake, whom Hector heard with joy elate. Before his van striding into the space Both hosts between, he with his spear transverse Press'd back the Trojans, and they sat. Down sat The well-greaved Greecians also at command Of Agamemnon; and in shape assumed Of vultures, Pallas and Apollo perch'd High on the lofty beech sacred to Jove The father Ægis-arm'd; delighted thence They view'd the peopled plain horrent around With shields and helms and glittering spears erect. As when fresh-blowing Zephyrus the flood Sweeps first, the ocean blackens at the blast, Such seem'd the plain whereon the Achaians sat And Trojans, whom between thus Hector spake. Ye Trojans, and Achaians brazen-greaved, Attend while I shall speak! Jove high-enthroned Hath not fulfill'd the truce, but evil plans Against both hosts, till either ye shall take Troy's lofty towers, or shall yourselves in flight Fall vanquish'd at your billow-cleaving barks. With you is all the flower of Greece. Let him Whose heart shall move him to encounter sole Illustrious Hector, from among you all Stand forth, and Jove be witness to us both. If he, with his long-pointed lance, of life Shall me bereave, my armour is his prize, Which he shall hence into your fleet convey; Not so my body; that he shall resign For burial to the men and wives of Troy. But if Apollo make the glory mine, And he fall vanquish'd, him will I despoil, And hence conveying into sacred Troy His arms, will in the temple hang them high Of the bow-bender God, but I will send His body to the fleet, that him the Greeks May grace with rites funereal. On the banks Of wide-spread Hellespont ye shall upraise His tomb, and as they cleave with oary barks The sable Deep, posterity shall say— “It is a warrior's tomb; in ancient days, The Hero died; him warlike Hector slew.” So men shall speak hereafter, and my fame Who slew him, and my praise, shall never die. He ceased, and all sat mute. His challenge bold None dared accept, which yet they blush'd to shun, Till Menelaus, at the last, arose Groaning profound, and thus reproach'd the Greeks. Ah boasters! henceforth women—men no more— Eternal shame, shame infinite is ours, If none of all the Greecians dares contend With Hector. Dastards—deaf to glory's call— Rot where ye sit! I will myself take arms Against him, for the gods alone dispose, At their own pleasure, the events of war. He ended, and put on his radiant arms. Then, Menelaus, manifest appear'd Thy death, approaching by the dreadful hands Of Hector, mightier far in arms than thou, But that the Chiefs of the Achaians all Upstarting stay'd thee, and himself the King, The son of Atreus, on thy better hand Seizing affectionate, thee thus address'd. Thou ravest, my royal brother! and art seized With needless frenzy. But, however chafed, Restrain thy wrath, nor covet to contend With Priameian Hector, whom in fight All dread, a warrior thy superior far. Not even Achilles, in the glorious field, (Though stronger far than thou,) this hero meets Undaunted. Go then, and thy seat resume In thy own band; the Achaians shall for him, Doubtless, some fitter champion furnish forth. Brave though he be, and with the toils of war Insatiable, he shall be willing yet, Seated on his bent knees, to breathe a while, Should he escape the arduous brunt severe. So saying, the hero by his counsel wise His brother's purpose alter'd; he complied, And his glad servants eased him of his arms. Then Nestor thus the Argive host bespake. Great woe, ye Gods! hath on Achaia fallen. Now may the warlike Peleus, hoary Chief, Who both with eloquence and wisdom rules The Myrmidons, our foul disgrace deplore. With him discoursing, erst, of ancient times, When all your pedigrees I traced, I made His heart bound in him at the proud report. But now, when he shall learn how here we sat Cowering at foot of Hector, he shall oft His hands uplift to the immortal Gods, Praying a swift release into the shades. Jove! Pallas! Phœbus! Oh that I were young As when the Pylians in fierce fight engaged The Arcadians spear-expert, beside the stream Of rapid Celadon! Beneath the walls We fought of Pheia, where the Jardan rolls. There Ereuthalion, Chief of Godlike form, Stood forth before his van, and with loud voice Defied the Pylians. Arm'd he was in steel By royal Areïthous whilom worn; Brave Areïthous, Corynetes The club-bearer. named By every tongue; for that in bow and spear Nought trusted he, but with an iron mace The close-embattled phalanx shatter'd wide. Him by address, not by superior force, Lycurgus vanquish'd, in a narrow pass, Where him his iron whirl-bat It is a word used by Dryden. nought avail'd. Lycurgus stealing on him, with his lance Transpierced and fix'd him to the soil supine. Him of his arms, bright gift of brazen Mars, He stripp'd, which after, in the embattled field Lycurgus wore himself, but, growing old, Surrender'd them to Ereuthalion's use His armour-bearer, high in his esteem, And Ereuthalion wore them on the day When he defied our best. All hung their heads And trembled; none dared meet him; till at last With inborn courage warm'd, and nought dismayed, Though youngest of them all, I undertook That contest, and, by Pallas' aid, prevail'd. I slew the man in height and bulk all men Surpassing, and much soil he cover'd slain. Oh for the vigour of those better days! Then should not Hector want a champion long, Whose call to combat, ye, although the prime And pride of all our land, seem slow to hear. He spake reproachful, when at once arose Nine heroes. Agamemnon, King of men, Foremost arose; then Tydeus' mighty son, With either Ajax in fierce prowess clad; The Cretan next, Idomeneus, with whom Uprose Meriones his friend approved, Terrible as the man-destroyer Mars. Evæmon's noble offspring next appear'd Eurypylus; Andræmon's son the next Thoas; and last, Ulysses, glorious Chief. All these stood ready to engage in arms With warlike Hector, when the ancient King, Gerenian Nestor, thus his speech resumed. Now cast the lot for all. Who wins the chance Shall yield Achaia service, and himself Serve also, if successful he escape This brunt of hostile hardiment severe. So Nestor. They, inscribing each his lot, Into the helmet cast it of the son Of Atreus, Agamemnon. Then the host Pray'd all, their hands uplifting, and with eyes To the wide heavens directed, many said— Eternal sire! chuse Ajax, or the son Of Tydeus, or the King himself Agamemnon. who sways The sceptre in Mycenæ wealth-renown'd! Such prayer the people made; then Nestor shook The helmet, and forth leaped, whose most they wished, The lot of Ajax. Throughout all the host To every chief and potentate of Greece, From right to left the herald bore the lot By all disown'd; but when at length he reach'd The inscriber of the lot, who cast it in, Illustrious Ajax, in his open palm The herald placed it, standing at his side. He, conscious, with heroic joy the lot Cast at his foot, and thus exclaim'd aloud. My friends! the lot is mine, and my own heart Rejoices also; for I nothing doubt That noble Hector shall be foil'd by me. But while I put mine armour on, pray all In silence to the King Saturnian Jove, Lest, while ye pray, the Trojans overhear. Or pray aloud, for whom have we to dread? No man shall my firm standing by his strength Unsettle, or for ignorance of mine Me vanquish, who, I hope, brought forth and train'd In Salamis, have, now, not much to learn. He ended. They with heaven-directed eyes The King in prayer address'd, Saturnian Jove. Jove! glorious father! who from Ida's height Controulest all below, let Ajax prove Victorious, make the honour all his own! Or, if not less than Ajax, Hector share Thy love and thy regard, divide the prize Of glory, and let each atchieve renown! Then Ajax put his radiant armour on, And, arm'd complete, rush'd forward. As huge Mars To battle moves the sons of men between Whom Jove with heart-devouring thirst inspires Of war, so moved huge Ajax to the fight, Tower of the Greeks, dilating with a smile His martial features terrible; on feet, Firm-planted, to the combat he advanced Stride after stride, and shook his quivering spear. Him viewing, Argos' universal host Exulted, while a panic loosed the knees Of every Trojan; even Hector's heart Beat double, but escape for him remain'd None now, or to retreat into his ranks Again, from whom himself had challenged forth. Ajax advancing like a tower his shield Sevenfold, approach'd. It was the labour'd work Of Tychius, armourer of matchless skill, Who dwelt in Hyla; coated with the hides Of seven high-pamper'd bulls that shield he framed For Ajax, and the disk plated with brass. Advancing it before his breast, the son Of Telamon approach'd the Trojan Chief, And face to face, him threatening, thus began. Now, Hector, prove, by me alone opposed, What Chiefs the Danaï can furnish forth In absence of the lion-hearted prince Achilles, breaker of the ranks of war. He, in his billow-cleaving barks incensed Against our leader Agamemnon, lies; But warriors of my measure, who may serve To cope with thee, we want not; numerous such Are found amongst us. But begin the fight. To whom majestic Hector fierce in arms. Ajax! heroic leader of the Greeks! Offspring of Telamon! essay not me With words to terrify, as I were boy Or girl unskill'd in war; I am a man Well exercised in battle, who have shed The blood of many a warrior, and have learn'd, From hand to hand shifting my shield, to fight Unwearied; I can make a sport of war, In standing fight adjusting all my steps To martial measures sweet, or vaulting light Into my chariot, thence can urge the foe. Yet in contention with a Chief like thee I will employ no stratagem, or seek To smite thee privily, but with a stroke (If I may reach thee) visible to all. So saying, he shook, then hurl'd his massy spear At Ajax, and his broad shield sevenfold On its eighth surface of resplendent brass Smote full; six hides the unblunted weapon pierced, But in the seventh stood rooted. Ajax, next, Heroic chief, hurl'd his long-shadow'd spear And struck the oval shield of Priam's son. Through his bright disk the weapon tempest-driven Glided, and in his hauberk-rings infixt At his soft flank, ripp'd wide his vest within. Inclined oblique he 'scaped the dreadful doom. Then each from other's shield his massy spear Recovering quick, like lions hunger-pinch'd Or wild boars irresistible in force, They fell to close encounter. Priam's son The shield of Ajax at its centre smote, But fail'd to pierce it, for he bent his point. Sprang Ajax then, and meeting full the targe Of Hector, shock'd him; through it and beyond He urged the weapon with its sliding edge Athwart his neck, and blood was seen to start. But still, for no such cause, from battle ceased Crest-tossing Hector, but retiring, seized An huge stone angled sharp and black with age That on the champain lay. The bull-hide guard Sevenfold of Ajax with that stone he smote Full on its centre; sang the circling brass. Then Ajax far an heavier stone upheaved; He whirled it, and with might immeasurable Dismiss'd the mass, which with a mill-stone weight Sank through the shield of Hector, and his knees Disabled; with his shield supine he fell, But by Apollo raised, stood soon again. And now, with swords they had each other hewn, Had not the messengers of Gods and men The heralds wise, Idæus on the part Of Ilium, and Talthybius for the Greeks, Advancing interposed. His sceptre each Between them held, and thus Idæus spake. My children, cease! prolong not still the fight. Ye both are dear to cloud-assembler Jove, Both valiant, and all know it. But the night Hath fallen, and night's command must be obeyed. To him the son of Telamon replied. Idæus! bid thy master speak as thou. He is the challenger. If such his choice, Mine differs not; I wait but to comply. Him answer'd then heroic Hector huge. Since, Ajax, the immortal powers on thee Have bulk pre-eminent and strength bestow'd, With such address in battle, that the host Of Greece hath not thine equal at the spear, Now let the combat cease. We shall not want More fair occasion; on some future day We will not part till all-disposing heaven Shall give thee victory, or shall make her mine. But night hath fallen, and night must be obey'd, That thou may'st gratify with thy return The Achaians, and especially thy friends And thy own countrymen. I go, no less To exhilarate in Priam's royal town Men and robed matrons, who shall seek the Gods For me, with pious ceremonial due. But come. We will exchange, or ere we part, Some princely gift, that Greece and Troy may say Hereafter, with soul-wasting rage they fought, But parted with the gentleness of friends. So saying, he with its sheath and belt a sword Presented bright-emboss'd, and a bright belt Purpureal This word I have taken leave to coin. The Latins have both substantive and adjective. Purpura—Purpureus. We make purple serve both uses; but it seems a poverty to which we have no need to submit, at least in poetry. took from Ajax in return. Thus separated, one the Greecians sought, And one the Trojans; they when him they saw From the unconquer'd hands return'd alive Of Ajax, with delight their Chief received, And to the city led him, double joy Conceiving all at his unhoped escape. On the other side, the Greecians brazen-mail'd To noble Agamemnon introduced Exulting Ajax, and the King of men In honour of the conqueror slew an ox Of the fifth year to Jove omnipotent. Him flaying first, they carved him next and spread The whole abroad, then, scoring deep the flesh, They pierced it with the spits, and from the spits, (Once roasted well) withdrew it all again. Their labour thus accomplish'd, and the board Furnish'd with plenteous cheer, they feasted all Till all were satisfied; nor Ajax miss'd The conqueror's meed, to whom the hero-king Wide-ruling Agamemnon, gave the chine Perpetual The word is here used in the Latin sense of it. Virgil, describing the entertainment given by Evander to the Trojans, says that he regaled them Perpetui tergo bovis et lustralibus extis. Æn. viii. It means, the whole., his distinguish'd portion due. The calls of hunger and of thirst at length Both well sufficed, thus, foremost of them all The ancient Nestor, whose advice had oft Proved salutary, prudent thus began. Chiefs of Achaia, and thou, chief of all, Great Agamemnon! Many of our host Lie slain, whose blood sprinkles, in battle shed, The banks of smooth Scamander, and their souls Have journey'd down into the realms of death. To-morrow, therefore, let the battle pause As need requires, and at the peep of day With mules and oxen, wheel ye from all parts The dead, that we may burn them near the fleet. So, home to Greece returning, will we give The fathers' ashes to the children's care. Accumulating next, the pile around, One common tomb for all, with brisk dispatch We will upbuild for more secure defence Of us and of our fleet, strong towers and tall Adjoining to the tomb, and every tower Shall have its ponderous gate, commodious pass Affording to the mounted charioteer. And last, without those towers and at their foot, Dig we a trench, which compassing around Our camp, both steeds and warriors shall exclude, And all fierce inroad of the haughty foe. So counsell'd he, whom every Chief approved. In Troy meantime, at Priam's gate beside The lofty citadel, debate began The assembled senators between, confused, Clamorous, and with furious heat pursued, When them Antenor, prudent, thus bespake. Ye Trojans, Dardans, and allies of Troy, My counsel hear! Delay not. Instant yield To the Atridæ, hence to be convey'd, Helen of Greece with all that is her own. For charged with violated oaths we fight, And hope I none conceive that aught by us Design'd shall prosper, unless so be done. He spake and sat; when from his seat arose Paris, fair Helen's noble paramour, Who thus with speech impassion'd quick replied. Antenor! me thy counsel hath not pleased; Thou could'st have framed far better; but if this Be thy deliberate judgement, then the Gods Make thy deliberate judgement nothing worth. But I will speak myself. Ye Chiefs of Troy, I tell you plain. I will not yield my spouse. But all her treasures to our house convey'd From Argos, those will I resign, and add Still other compensation from my own. Thus Paris said and sat; when like the Gods Themselves in wisdom, from his seat uprose Dardanian Priam, who them thus address'd. Trojans, Dardanians, and allies of Troy! I shall declare my sentence; hear ye me. Now let the legions, as at other times, Take due refreshment; let the watch be set, And keep ye vigilant guard. At early dawn We will dispatch Idæus to the fleet, Who shall inform the Atridæ of this last Resolve of Paris, author of the war. Discreet Idæus also shall propose A respite (if the Atridæ so incline) From war's dread clamour, while we burn the dead. Then will we clash again, till heaven at length Shall part us, and the doubtful strife decide. He ceased, whose voice the assembly pleased, obey'd. Then, troop by troop, the army took repast, And at the dawn Idæus sought the fleet; He found the Danaï, servants of Mars, Beside the stern of Agamemnon's ship Consulting; and amid the assembled Chiefs Arrived, with utterance clear them thus address'd. Ye sons of Atreus, and ye Chiefs, the flower Of all Achaia! Priam and the Chiefs Of Ilium, bade me to your ear impart (If chance such embassy might please your ear) The mind of Paris, author of the war. The treasures which on board his ships he brought From Argos home, (oh, had he perish'd first!) He yields them with addition from his own. Not so the consort of the glorious prince Brave Menelaus; her, (although in Troy All counsel otherwise,) he still detains. Thus too I have in charge. Are ye inclined That the dread-sounding clamours of the field Be caused to cease, till we shall burn the dead? Then will we clash again, 'till heaven at length Shall part us, and the doubtful strife decide, So spake Idæus, and all silent sat; Till at the last brave Diomede replied. No. We will none of Paris' treasures now, Nor even Helen's self. A child may see Destruction winging swift her course to Troy. He said. The admiring Greeks with loud applause All praised the speech of warlike Diomede, And answer thus the King of men return'd. Idæus! thou hast witness'd the resolve Of the Achaian Chiefs, whose choice is mine. But for the slain, I shall not envy them A funeral pile; the spirit fled, delay Suits not. Last rites cannot too soon be paid. Burn them. And let high-thundering Jove attest Himself mine oath, that war shall cease the while. So saying, he to all the Gods upraised His sceptre, and Idæus homeward sped To sacred Ilium. The Dardanians there And Trojans, all assembled, his return Expected anxious. He amid them told Distinct his errand, when, at once dissolved, The whole assembly rose, these to collect The scatter'd bodies, those to gather wood; While on the other side, the Greeks arose As sudden, and all issuing from the fleet Sought fuel, some, and, some, the scatter'd dead. Now from the gently-swelling flood profound The sun arising, with his earliest rays In his ascent to heaven smote on the fields. When Greeks and Trojans met. Scarce could the slain Be clear distinguish'd, but they cleansed from each His clotted gore with water, and warm tears Distilling copious, heaved them to the wains. But wailing none was heard, for such command Had Priam issued; therefore heaping high The bodies, silent and with sorrowing hearts They burn'd them, and to sacred Troy return'd. The Greecians also, on the funeral pile The bodies heaping sad, burn'd them with fire Together, and return'd into the fleet. Then, ere the peep of dawn, and while the veil Of night, though thinner, still o'erhung the earth, Achaians, chosen from the rest, the pile Encompass'd. With a tomb (one tomb for all) They crown'd the spot adust, and to the tomb (For safety of their fleet and of themselves) Strong fortress added of high wall and tower, With solid gates affording egress thence Commodious to the mounted charioteer; Deep foss and broad they also dug without, And planted it with piles. So toil'd the Greeks. The Gods, that mighty labour, from beside The Thunderer's throne with admiration view'd, When Neptune, shaker of the shores, began. Eternal father! is there on the face Of all the boundless earth one mortal man Who will, in times to come, consult with heaven? See'st thou yon height of wall, and yon deep trench With which the Greecians have their fleet inclosed, And, careless of our blessing, hectacomb Or invocation have presented none? Far as the day-spring shoots herself abroad, So far the glory of this work shall spread, While Phœbus and myself, who, toiling hard, Built walls for king Laomedon, shall see Forgotten all the labour of our hands. To whom, indignant, thus high-thundering Jove. Oh thou, who shakest the solid earth at will, What hast thou spoken? An inferior power, A god of less sufficiency than thou, Might be allowed some fear from such a cause. Fear not. Where'er the morning shoots her beams, Thy glory shall be known; and when the Greeks Shall seek their country through the waves again, Then break this bulwark down, submerge it whole, And spreading deep with sand the spacious shore As at the first, leave not a trace behind. Such conference held the Gods; and now the sun Went down, and, that great work perform'd, the Greeks From tent to tent slaughter'd the fatted ox And ate their evening cheer. Meantime arrived Large fleet with Lemnian wine; Euneus, son Of Jason and Hypsipile, that fleet From Lemnos freighted, and had stow'd on board A thousand measures from the rest apart For the Atridæ; but the host at large By traffic were supplied; some barter'd brass, Others bright steel; some purchased wine with hides, These with their cattle, with their captives those, And the whole host prepared a glad regale. All night the Greecians feasted, and the host Of Ilium, and all night deep-planning Jove Portended dire calamities to both, Thundering tremendous!—Pale was every cheek; Each pour'd his goblet on the ground, nor dared The hardiest drink, 'till he had first perform'd Libation meet to the Saturnian King Omnipotent; then, all retiring, sought Their couches, and partook the gift of sleep. BOOK VIII. ARGUMENT OF THE EIGHTH BOOK. Jove calls a council, in which he forbids all interference of the Gods between the Greeks and Trojans. He repairs to Ida, where having consulted the scales of destiny, he directs his lightning against the Greecians. Nestor is endangered by the death of one of his horses. Diomede delivers him. In the chariot of Diomede they both hasten to engage Hector, whose charioteer is slain by Diomede. Jupiter again interposes by his thunders, and the whole Greecian host, discomfited, is obliged to seek refuge within the rampart. Diomede, with others, at sight of a favourable omen sent from Jove in answer to Agamemnon's prayer, sallies. Teucer performs great exploits, but is disabled by Hector. Juno and Pallas set forth from Olympus in aid of the Greecians, but are stopped by Jupiter, who reascends from Ida, and in heaven foretells the distresses which await the Greecians. Hector takes measures for the security of Troy during the night, and prepares his host for an assault to be made on the Greecian camp in the morning. The saffron-mantled morning now was spread O'er all the nations, when the Thunderer Jove, On the deep-fork'd Olympian topmost height Convened the Gods in council, amid whom He spake himself; they all attentive heard. Gods! Goddesses! Inhabitants of heaven! Attend; I make my secret purpose known. Let neither God nor Goddess interpose My counsel to rescind, but with one heart Approve it, that it reach, at once, its end. Whom I shall mark soever from the rest Withdrawn, that he may Greeks or Trojans aid, Disgrace shall find him; shamefully chastised He shall return to the Olympian heights, Or I will hurl him deep into the gulfs Of gloomy Tartarus, where Hell shuts fast Her iron gates, and spreads her brazen floor, As far below the shades, as earth from heaven. There shall he learn how far I pass in might All others; which if ye incline to doubt, Now prove me. Let ye down the golden chain From heaven, and at its nether links pull all Both Goddesses and Gods. But me your King, Supreme in wisdom, ye shall never draw To earth from heaven, toil adverse as ye may. Yet I, when once I shall be pleased to pull, The earth itself, itself the sea, and you Will lift with ease together, and will wind The chain around the spiry summit sharp Of the Olympian, that all things upheaved Shall hang in the mid heaven. So far do I, Compared with all who live, transcend them all. He ended, and the Gods long time amazed Sat silent, for with awful tone he spake; But at the last Pallas blue-eyed began. Father! Saturnian Jove! of Kings supreme! We know thy force resistless; but our hearts Feel not the less, when we behold the Greeks Exhausting all the sorrows of their lot. If thou command, we, doubtless, will abstain From battle, yet such counsel to the Greeks Suggesting still, as may in part effect Their safety, lest thy wrath consume them all. To whom with smiles answer'd cloud-gatherer Jove. Fear not, my child! stern as mine accent was, I forced a frown—no more. For in mine heart Nought feel I but benevolence to thee. He said, and to his chariot join'd his steeds Swift, brazen-hoof'd, and maned with wavy gold; He put on golden raiment, his bright scourge Of gold receiving rose into his seat, And lash'd his steeds; they not unwilling flew Midway the earth between and starry heaven. To spring fed Ida, mother of wild beasts, He came, where stands in Gargarus his shrine Breathing fresh incense! there the Sire of all Arriving, loosed his coursers, and around Involving them in gather'd clouds opaque, Sat on the mountain's head, in his own might Exulting, with the towers of Ilium all Beneath his eye, and the whole fleet of Greece. In all their tents, meantime, Achaia's sons Took short refreshment, and for fight prepared. On the other side, though fewer, yet constrain'd By strong necessity, throughout all Troy, In the defence of children and of wives Ardent, the Trojans panted for the field. Wide flew the city-gates: forth rush'd to war Horsemen and foot, and tumult wild arose. They met, they clash'd; loud was the din of spears And bucklers on their bosoms brazen mail'd Encountering, shields in opposition firm Met bossy shields, and tumult wild arose In the repetition of this expression, the translator follows the original.. There many a shout and many a dying groan Were heard, the slayer and the maim'd aloud Clamouring, and the earth was drench'd with blood. 'Till sacred morn had brighten'd into noon, The vollied weapons on both sides their task Perform'd effectual, and the people fell. But when the sun had climb'd the middle skies, The Sire of all then took his golden scales; Doom against doom he weigh'd, the eternal fates In counterpoise, of Trojans and of Greeks. He raised the beam; low sank the heavier lot Of the Achaians; the Achaian doom Subsided, and the Trojan struck the skies. Then roar'd his thunders from the summit hurl'd Of Ida, and his vivid lightnings flew Into Achaia's host. They at the sight Astonish'd stood; fear whiten'd every cheek. Idomeneus dared not himself abide That shock, nor Agamemnon stood, nor stood The heroes Ajax, ministers of Mars. Gerenian Nestor, guardian of the Greeks, Alone fled not, nor he by choice remain'd, But by his steed retarded, which the mate Of beauteous Helen, Paris, with a shaft Had stricken where the forelock grows, a part Of all most mortal. Tortured by the wound Erect he rose, the arrow in his brain, And writhing furious, scared his fellow steeds. Meantime, while, strenuous, with his falchion's edge The hoary warrior stood slashing the reins, Through multitudes of fierce pursuers borne On rapid wheels, the dauntless charioteer, Approach'd him, Hector. Then, past hope, had died The ancient King, but Diomede discern'd His peril imminent, and with a voice Like thunder, called Ulysses to his aid. Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd! Art thou too fugitive, and turn'st thy back Like the base multitude? Ah! fear a lance Implanted ignominious in thy spine. Stop—Nestor dies. Fell Hector is at hand. So shouted Diomede, whose summons loud, Ulysses yet heard not, but, passing, flew With headlong haste to the Achaian fleet. Then, Diomede, unaided as he was, Rush'd ardent to the vaw-ward, and before The steeds of the Neleian sovereign old Standing, in accents wing'd, him thus address'd. Old Chief! these youthful warriors are too brisk For thee, press'd also by encroaching age. Thy servant too is feeble, and thy steeds Are tardy. Mount my chariot. Thou shalt see With what rapidity the steeds of Troy, Pursuing or retreating, scour the field. I took them from that terror of his foes, Æneas. Thine to our attendants leave, While these against the warlike powers of Troy We push direct; that Hector's self may know If my spear rage not furious as his own. He said, nor the Gerenian Chief refused. Thenceforth their servants, Sthenelus and good Eurymedon, took charge of Nestor's steeds, And they the chariot of Tydides both Ascended; Nestor seized the reins, plied well The scourge, and soon they met. Tydides hurl'd At Hector first, while rapid he advanced; But missing Hector, wounded in the breast Eniopeus his charioteer, the son Of brave Thebæus, managing the steeds. He fell; his fiery coursers, at the sound Startled, recoil'd, and where he fell he died. Deep sorrow for his charioteer o'erwhelm'd The mind of Hector; yet, although he mourn'd He left him, and another sought as brave. Nor wanted long his steeds a charioteer, For finding soon the son of Iphitus, Bold Archeptolemus, he bade him mount His chariot, and the reins gave to his hand. Then deeds of bloodiest note should have ensued, Penn'd had the Trojans been, as lambs, in Troy, But for quick succour of the sire of all. Thundering, he downward hurled his candent bolt To the horse-feet of Diomede; dire fumed The flaming sulphur, and both horses drove Under the axle, belly to the ground. Forth flew the splendid reins from Nestor's hand, And thus to Diomede, appall'd, he spake. Back to the fleet, Tydides! Can'st not see That Jove ordains not, now, the victory thine? The son of Saturn glorifies to-day This Trojan, and, if such his will, can make The morrow ours; but vain it is to thwart The mind of Jove, for he is Lord of all. To him the valiant Diomede replied. Thou hast well said, old warrior! but the pang That wrings my soul, is this. The public ear In Ilium shall from Hector's lips be told— I drove Tydides—fearing me he fled. So shall he vaunt, and may the earth her jaws That moment opening swallow me alive! Him answer'd the Gerenian warrior old. What saith the son of Tydeus, glorious Chief? Should Hector so traduce thee as to call Thee base and timid, neither Trojan him Nor Dardan would believe, nor yet the wives Of numerous shielded warriors brave of Troy, Widow'd by thy unconquerable arm. So saying, he through the fugitives his steeds Turn'd swift to flight. Then Hector and his host With clamour infinite their darts woe-wing'd Shower'd after them, and Hector, mighty Chief Majestic, from afar, thus call'd aloud. Tydides! thee the Danaï swift-horsed Were wont to grace with a superior seat, The mess of honour, and the brimming cup, But now will mock thee. Thou art woman now. Go, timorous girl! Thou never shalt behold Me flying, climb our battlements, or lead Our women captive. I will slay thee first. He ceased. Then Diomede in dread suspense Thrice purposed, turning, to withstand the foe, And thrice in thunder from the mountain-top Jove gave the signal of success to Troy, When Hector thus the Trojans hail'd aloud. Trojans and Lycians, and close-warring sons Of Dardanus, oh summon all your might, Now, now be men! I know that from his heart Saturnian Jove glory and bright success For me prepares, but havoc for the Greeks. Fools! they shall find this wall which they have raised Too weak to check my course, a feeble guard Contemptible; such also is the trench; My steeds shall slight it with an easy leap. But when ye see me in their fleet arrived, Remember fire. Then bring me flaming brands That I may burn their galleys, and themselves Slaughter beside them, struggling in the smoke. He spake, and thus encouraged next his steeds. Xanthus! Podargus! and ye generous pair Æthon and glossy Lampus! now requite Mine, and the bounty of Andromache, Far-famed Eëtion's daughter; she your bowl With corn fresh-flavour'd and with wine full oft Hath mingled, your refreshment seeking first Ere mine, who have a youthful husband's claim. Now follow! now be swift; that we may seize The shield of Nestor, bruited to the skies As golden all, trappings and disk alike. Now from the shoulders of the equestrian Chief Tydides tear we off his splendid mail, The work of Vulcan. May we take but these, I have good hope that, ere this night be spent, The Greeks shall climb their galleys and away. So vaunted he, but Juno with disdain His proud boast heard, and shuddering in her throne, Rock'd the Olympian; turning then toward The Ocean's mighty sovereign, thus she spake. Alas! earth-shaking sovereign of the waves, Feel'st thou no pity of the perishing Greeks? Yet Greece, in Helice, with gifts nor few Nor sordid, and in Ægæ, honours thee, Whom therefore thou shouldst prosper. Would we all Who favour Greece associate to repulse The Trojans, and to check loud-thundering Jove, On Ida seated he might lour alone. To whom the sovereign, shaker of the shores, Indignant. Juno! rash in speech! what word Hath 'scaped thy lips? never, with my consent, Shall we, the powers subordinate, in arms With Jove contend. He far excels us all. So they. Meantime, the trench and wall between None daring to keep the field, and all striving to enter the gates together, they obstructed their own passage, and were, of course, compelled into the narrow interval between the foss and rampart. But there are different opinions about the space intended. See Villoisson., The narrow interval with steeds was fill'd Close throng'd and shielded warriors. There immew'd By Priameian Hector, fierce as Mars, They stood, for Hector had the help of Jove. And now with blazing fire their gallant barks He had consumed, but Juno moved the mind Of Agamemnon, vigilant himself, To exhortation of Achaia's host. Through camp and fleet the monarch took his way, And, his wide robe imperial in his hand, High on Ulysses' huge black galley stood, The central ship conspicuous; thence his voice Might reach the most remote of all the line At each extreme, where Ajax had his tent Pitch'd, and Achilles, fearless of surprise. Thence, with loud voice, the Greecians thus he hail'd. Oh shame to Greece! Warriors in shew alone! Where is your boasted prowess? Ye profess'd Vain-glorious erst in Lemnos, while ye fed Plenteously on the flesh of beeves full-grown, And crown'd your beakers high, that ye would face Each man a hundred Trojans in the field— Ay, twice a hundred,—yet are all too few To face one Hector now; nor doubt I aught But he shall soon fire the whole fleet of Greece. Jove! Father! what great sovereign ever felt Thy frowns as I? Whom hast thou shamed as me? Yet I neglected not, through all the course Of our disasterous voyage (in the hope That we should vanquish Troy) thy sacred rites, But where I found thine altar, piled it high With fat and flesh of bulls, on every shore. But oh, vouchsafe to us, that we at least Ourselves, deliver'd, may escape the sword, Nor let their foes thus tread the Greecians down! He said. The eternal father pitying saw His tears, and for the monarch's sake preserved The people. Instant, surest of all signs, He sent his eagle; in his pounces strong A fawn he bore, fruit of the nimble hind, Which fast beside the beauteous altar raised To Panomphæan To Jove the source of all oracular information. Jove sudden he dropp'd. They, conscious, soon, that sent from Jove he came, More ardent sprang to fight. Then none of all Those numerous Chiefs could boast that he outstripp'd Tydides, urging forth beyond the foss His rapid steeds, and rushing to the war. He, foremost far, a Trojan slew, the son Of Phradmon, Ageläus; as he turn'd His steeds to flight, him turning with his spear Through back and bosom Diomede transpierced, And with loud clangor of his arms he fell. Then, royal Agamemnon pass'd the trench And Menelaus; either Ajax, then, Clad with fresh prowess both; them follow'd, next, Idomeneus, with his heroic friend In battle dread as homicidal Mars, Meriones; Evæmon's son renown'd Succeeded, bold Eurypylus; and ninth Teucer, wide-straining his impatient bow. He under covert fought of the broad shield Of Telamonian Ajax; Ajax high Upraised his shield; the hero from beneath Took aim, and whom his arrow struck, he fell; Then close as to his mother's side a child For safety creeps, Teucer to Ajax' side Retired, and Ajax shielded him again. Whom then slew Teucer first, illustrious Chief? Orsilochus, and Ophelestes, first, And Ormenus he slew, then Dætor died, Chromius and Lycophontes brave in fight With Amopaon Polyæmon's son, And Melanippus. These, together heap'd, All fell by Teucer on the plain of Troy. The Trojan ranks thinn'd by his mighty bow The King of armies Agamemnon saw Well-pleased, and him approaching, thus began. Brave Telamonian Teucer, oh, my friend, Thus shoot, that light may visit once again The Danaï, and Telamon rejoice! Thee Telamon within his own abode Rear'd although spurious; mount him, in return, Although remote, on glory's heights again. I tell thee, and the effect shall follow sure, Let but the Thunderer and Minerva grant The pillage of fair Ilium to the Greeks, And I will give to thy victorious hand, After my own, the noblest recompense, A tripod or a chariot with its steeds, Or some fair captive to partake thy bed. To whom the generous Teucer thus replied. Atrides! glorious monarch! wherefore me Exhortest thou to battle? who myself Glow with sufficient ardour, and such strength As heaven affords me spare not to employ. Since first we drove them back, with watchful eye Their warriors I have mark'd; eight shafts my bow Hath sent long-barb'd, and every shaft, well-aim'd, The body of some Trojan youth robust Hath pierced, but still yon ravening wolf escapes. He said, and from the nerve another shaft Impatient sent at Hector; but it flew Devious, and brave Gorgythion struck instead. Him beautiful Castianira, brought By Priam from Æsyma, nymph of form Celestial, to the King of Ilium bore. As in the garden, with the weight surcharged Of its own fruit, and drench'd by vernal rains The poppy falls oblique, so he his head Hung languid, by his helmet's weight depress'd. Then Teucer yet an arrow from the nerve Dispatch'd at Hector, with impatience fired To pierce him; but again his weapon err'd Turn'd by Apollo, and the bosom struck Of Archeptolemus, his rapid steeds To battle urging, Hector's charioteer. He fell, his fiery coursers at the sound Recoil'd, and lifeless where he fell he lay. Deep sorrow for his charioteer the mind O'erwhelm'd of Hector, yet he left the slain, And seeing his own brother nigh at hand, Cebriones, him summon'd to the reins, Who with alacrity that charge received. Then Hector, leaping with a dreadful shout From his resplendent chariot, grasp'd a stone, And rush'd on Teucer, vengeance in his heart. Teucer had newly fitted to the nerve An arrow keen selected from the rest, And warlike Hector, while he stood the cord Retracting, smote him with that rugged rock Just where the key-bone interposed divides The neck and bosom, a most mortal part. It snapp'd the bow-string, and with numbing force Struck dead his hand; low on his knees he dropp'd, And from his opening grasp let fall the bow. Then not unmindful of a brother fallen Was Ajax, but, advancing rapid, stalk'd Around him, and his broad shield interposed, Till brave Alaster and Mecisteus, son Of Echius, friends of Teucer, from the earth Upraised and bore him groaning to the fleet. And now again fresh force Olympian Jove Gave to the Trojans; right toward the foss They drove the Greeks, while Hector in the van Advanced, death menacing in every look. As some fleet hound close-threatening flank or haunch Of boar or lion, oft as he his head Turns flying, marks him with a steadfast eye, So Hector chased the Greecians, slaying still The hindmost of the scatter'd multitude. But when, at length, both piles and hollow foss They had surmounted, and no few had fallen By Trojan hands, within their fleet they stood Imprison'd, calling each to each, and prayer With lifted hands, loud offering to the Gods. With Gorgon looks, meantime, and eyes of Mars, Hector impetuous his mane-tossing steeds From side to side before the rampart drove, When white-arm'd Juno pitying the Greeks, In accents wing'd her speech to Pallas turn'd. Alas, Jove's daughter! shall not we at least In this extremity of their distress Care for the Greecians by the fatal force Of this one Chief destroy'd? I can endure The rage of Priameïan Hector now No longer; such dire mischiefs he hath wrought. Whom answer'd thus Pallas, cærulean-eyed. —And Hector had himself long since his life Resign'd and rage together, by the Greeks Slain under Ilium's walls, but Jove, my sire, Mad counsels executing and perverse, Me counterworks in all that I attempt, Nor aught remembers how I saved ofttimes His son enjoin'd full many a task severe By King Eurystheus; to the Gods he wept, And me Jove sent in haste to his relief. But had I then foreseen what now I know, When through the adamantine gates he pass'd To bind the dog of hell, by the deep floods Hemm'd in of Styx, he had return'd no more. But Thetis wins him now; her will prevails, And mine he hates; for she hath kiss'd his knees And grasp'd his beard, and him in prayer implored That he would honour her heroic son Achilles, city-waster prince renown'd. 'Tis well,—the day shall come when Jove again Shall call me darling, and his blue-eyed maid As heretofore;—but thou thy steeds prepare, While I, my father's mansion entering, arm For battle. I would learn by trial sure, If Hector, Priam's offspring famed in fight (Ourselves appearing in the walks of war) Will greet us gladly. Doubtless at the fleet Some Trojan also, shall to dogs resign His flesh for food, and to the fowls of heaven. So counsell'd Pallas, nor the daughter dread Of mighty Saturn, Juno, disapproved, But busily and with dispatch prepared The trappings of her coursers golden-rein'd. Meantime, Minerva progeny of Jove, On the adamantine floor of his abode Let fall profuse her variegated robe, Labour of her own hands. She first put on The corslet of the cloud-assembler God, Then arm'd her for the field of woe, complete. Mounting the fiery chariot, next she seized Her ponderous spear, huge, irresistible, With which Jove's aweful daughter levels ranks Of heroes against whom her anger burns. Juno with lifted lash urged on the steeds. At their approach, spontaneous roar'd the wide- Unfolding gates of heaven; the heavenly gates Kept by the watchful Hours, to whom the charge Of the Olympian summit appertains, And of the boundless ether, back to roll, And to replace the cloudy barrier dense. Spurr'd through the portal flew the rapid steeds. Which when the Eternal Father from the heights Of Ida saw, kindling with instant ire To golden-pinion'd Iris thus he spake. Haste, Iris, turn them thither whence they came, Me let them not encounter; honour small To them, to me, should from that strife accrue. Tell them, and the effect shall sure ensue, That I will smite their steeds, and they shall halt Disabled, break their chariot, dash themselves Headlong, and ten whole years shall not efface The wounds by my avenging bolts impress'd. So shall my blue-eyed daughter learn to dread A father's anger; but for the offence Of Juno, I resent it less; for she Clashes ???????.—The word is here metaphorical, and expresses, in its primary use, the breaking of a spear against a shield. with all my counsels from of old. He ended; Iris with a tempest's speed From the Idæan summit soar'd at once To the Olympian; at the open gates Exterior of the mountain many-valed She stayed them, and her coming thus declared. Whither, and for what cause? What rage is this? Ye may not aid the Greecians; Jove forbids; The son of Saturn threatens, if ye force His wrath by perseverance into act, That he will smite your steeds, and they shall halt Disabled, break your chariot, dash yourselves Headlong, and ten whole years shall not efface The wounds by his avenging bolts impress'd. So shall his blue-eyed daughter learn to dread A father's anger; but for the offence Of Juno, he resents it less; for she Clashes with all his counsels from of old. But thou, Minerva, if thou dare indeed Lift thy vast spear against the breast of Jove, Incorrigible art and dead to shame. So saying, the rapid Iris disappear'd, And thus her speech to Pallas Juno turn'd. Ah Pallas, progeny of Jove! henceforth No longer, in the cause of mortal men, Contend we against Jove. Perish or live Greecians or Trojans as he wills; let him Dispose the order of his own concerns, And judge between them, as of right he may. So saying, she turn'd the coursers; them the Hours Released, and to ambrosial mangers bound, Then thrust their chariot to the luminous wall. They, mingling with the Gods, on golden thrones Dejected sat, and Jove from Ida borne Reach'd the Olympian heights, seat of the Gods. His steeds the glorious King of Ocean loosed, And thrust the chariot, with its veil o'erspread, Into its station at the altar's side. Then sat the Thunderer on his throne of gold Himself, and the huge mountain shook. Meantime Juno and Pallas, seated both apart, Spake not or question'd him. Their mute reserve He noticed, conscious of the cause, and said. Juno and Pallas, wherefore sit ye sad? Not through fatigue by glorious fight incurr'd And slaughter of the Trojans whom ye hate. Mark now the difference. Not the Gods combined Should have constrain'd me back, till all my force, Superior as it is, had fail'd, and all My fortitude. But ye, ere ye beheld The wonders of the field, trembling retired. And ye did well—Hear what had else befallen. My bolts had found you both, and ye had reach'd, In your own chariot borne, the Olympian height, Seat of the blest Immortals, never more. He ended; Juno and Minerva heard Low murmuring deep disgust, and side by side Devising sat calamity to Troy. Minerva, through displeasure against Jove, Nought utter'd, for her bosom boil'd with rage; But Juno check'd not hers, who thus replied. What word hath pass'd thy lips, Jove most severe! We know thy force resistless; yet our hearts Feel not the less when we behold the Greeks Exhausting all the sorrows of their lot. If thou command, we doubtless will abstain From battle, yet such counsel to the Greeks Suggesting still, as may in part effect Their safety, lest thy wrath consume them all. Then answer, thus, cloud-gatherer Jove return'd. Look forth, imperial Juno, if thou wilt, To-morrow at the blush of earliest dawn, And thou shalt see Saturn's almighty son The Argive host destroying far and wide. For Hector's fury shall admit no pause Till he have roused Achilles, in that day When at the ships, in perilous streights, the hosts Shall wage fierce battle for Patroclus slain. Such is the voice of fate. But as for thee— Withdraw thou to the confines of the abyss Where Saturn and Iäpetus retired, Exclusion sad endure from balmy airs And from the light of morn, hell-girt around, I will not call thee thence. No. Should thy rage Transport thee thither, there thou may'st abide, There sullen nurse thy disregarded spleen Obstinate as thou art, and void of shame. He ended; to whom Juno nought replied. And now the radiant sun in Ocean sank, Drawing night after him o'er all the earth; Night, undesired by Troy, but to the Greeks Thrice welcome for its interposing gloom. Then Hector on the river's brink fast by The Greecian fleet, where space he found unstrew'd With carcases, convened the Chiefs of Troy. They, there dismounting, listen'd to the words Of Hector Jove-beloved; he grasp'd a spear In length eleven cubits, bright its head Of brass, and collar'd with a ring of gold. He lean'd on it, and ardent thus began. Trojans, Dardanians, and allies of Troy! I hoped, this evening, (every ship consumed, And all the Greecians slain,) to have return'd To wind-swept Ilium. But the shades of night Have intervened, and to the night they owe, In chief, their whole fleet's safety and their own. Now, therefore, as the night enjoins, all take Needful refreshment. Your high-mettled steeds Release, lay food before them, and in haste Drive hither from the city fatted sheep And oxen; bring ye from your houses bread, Make speedy purchase of heart-cheering wine, And gather fuel plenteous; that all night, E'en till Aurora, daughter of the morn Shall look abroad, we may with many fires Illume the skies; lest even in the night, Launching, they mount the billows and escape. Beware that they depart not unannoy'd, But, as he leaps on board, give each a wound With shaft or spear, which he shall nurse at home. So shall the nations fear us, and shall vex With ruthless war Troy's gallant sons no more. Next, let the heralds, ministers of Jove, Loud notice issue, that the boys well-grown, And ancients silver-hair'd on the high towers Built by the Gods, keep watch; on every hearth In Troy, let those of the inferior sex Make sprightly blaze, and place ye there a guard Sufficient, lest in absence of the troops An ambush enter, and surprise the town. Act thus, ye dauntless Trojans; the advice Is wholesome, and shall serve the present need, And so much for the night; ye shall be told The business of the morn when morn appears. It is my prayer to Jove and to all heaven (Not without hope) that I may hence expel These dogs, whom Ilium's unpropitious fates Have wafted hither in their sable barks. But we will also watch this night, ourselves, And, arming with the dawn, will at their ships Give them brisk onset. Then shall it appear If Diomede the brave shall me compel Back to our walls, or I, his arms blood-stain'd, Torn from his breathless body, bear away. To-morrow, if he dare but to abide My lance, he shall not want occasion meet For show of valour. But much more I judge That the next rising sun shall see him slain With no few friends around him. Would to heaven! I were as sure to 'scape the blight of age, And share their honours with the Gods above, As comes the morrow fraught with woe to Greece. So Hector, whom his host with loud acclaim All praised. Then each his sweating steeds released, And rein'd them safely at his chariot-side. And now from Troy provision large they brought, Oxen, and sheep, with store of wine and bread, And fuel much was gather'd. The following lines, to the end of this paragraph, are a translation of some which Barnes has here inserted from the second Alcibiades of Plato. Next, the Gods With sacrifice they sought, and from the plain Upwafted by the winds the smoke aspired Savoury, but unacceptable to those Above; such hatred in their hearts they bore To Priam, to the people of the brave Spear-practised Priam, and to sacred Troy. Big with great purposes and proud, they sat, Not disarray'd, but in fair form disposed Of even ranks, and watch'd their numerous fires. As when around the clear bright moon, the stars Shine in full splendour, and the winds are hush'd, The groves, the mountain-tops, the headland-heights Stand all apparent, not a vapour streaks The boundless blue, but ether open'd wide All glitters, and the shepherd's heart is cheer'd; So numerous seem'd those fires the bank between Of Xanthus, blazing, and the fleet of Greece, In prospect all of Troy; a thousand fires, Each watch'd by fifty warriors seated near. The steeds beside the chariots stood, their corn Chewing, and waiting till the golden-throned Aurora should restore the light of day. BOOK IX. ARGUMENT OF THE NINTH BOOK. By advice of Nestor, Agamemnon sends Ulysses, Phœnix, and Ajax to the tent of Achilles with proposals of reconciliation. They execute their commission, but without effect. Phœnix remains with Achilles; Ulysses and Ajax return. So watch'd the Trojan host; but thoughts of flight, Companions of chill fear, from heaven infused, Possess'd the Greecians; every leader's heart Bled, pierced with anguish insupportable. As when two adverse winds blowing from Thrace, Boreas and Zephyrus, the fishy Deep Vex sudden, all around, the sable flood High curl'd, flings forth the salt weed on the shore, Such tempest rent the mind of every Greek. Forth stalk'd Atrides with heart-riving woe Transfixt; he bade his heralds call by name Each Chief to council, but without the sound Of proclamation; and that task himself Among the foremost sedulous perform'd. The sad assembly sat; when weeping fast As some deep In the original the word is—??????????—dark-watered,— and it is rendered—deep—by the best interpreters, because deep waters have a blackish appearance. ???????? ???? is properly water that runs with rapidity; water—???? ???????? ?????????. —See Villoisson. fountain pours its rapid stream Down from the summit of a lofty rock, King Agamemnon in the midst arose, And, groaning, the Achaians, thus address'd. Friends, counsellors and leaders of the Greeks! In dire perplexity Saturnian Jove Involves me, cruel; he assured me erst, And solemnly, that I should not return Till I had wasted wall-encircled Troy; But now (ah fraudulent and foul reverse!) Commands me back inglorious to the shores Of distant Argos, with diminish'd troops. So stands the purpose of almighty Jove, Who many a citadel hath laid in dust, And shall hereafter, matchless in his power. Haste therefore. My advice is, that we all Fly with our fleet into our native land, For wide-built Ilium shall not yet be ours. He ceased, and all sat silent; long the sons Of Greece, o'erwhelm'd with sorrow, silent sat, When thus, at last, bold Diomede began. Atrides! foremost of the Chiefs I rise To contravert thy purpose ill-conceived, And with such freedom as the laws, O King! Of consultation and debate allow. Hear patient. Thou hast been thyself the first Who e'er reproach'd me in the public ear As one effeminate and slow to fight; How truly, let both young and old decide. The son of wiley Saturn hath to thee Given, and refused; he placed thee high in power, Gave thee to sway the sceptre o'er us all, But courage gave thee not, his noblest gift. Art thou in truth persuaded that the Greeks Are pusillanimous, as thou hast said? If thy own fears impel thee to depart, Go thou, the way is open; numerous ships, Thy followers from Mycenæ, line the shore. But we, the rest, depart not, 'till the spoil Of Troy reward us. Or if all incline To seek again their native home, fly all; Myself and Sthenelus will persevere Till Ilium fall, for with the Gods we came. He ended; all the admiring sons of Greece With shouts the warlike Diomede extoll'd, When thus equestrian Nestor next began. Tydides, thou art eminently brave In fight, and all the princes of thy years Excell'st in council. None of all the Greeks Shall find occasion just to blame thy speech Or to gainsay; yet thou hast fallen short. What wonder? Thou art young; and were myself Thy father, thou should'st be my latest-born. Yet when thy speech is to the Kings of Greece, It is well framed and prudent. Now attend! Myself will speak, who have more years to boast Than thou hast seen, and will so closely scan The matter, that Atrides, our supreme, Himself shall have no cause to censure me. He is a wretch, insensible and dead To all the charities of social life, Whose pleasure is in civil broils alone The observation seems made with a view to prevent such a reply from Agamemnon to Diomede as might give birth to new dissentions, while it reminds him indirectly of the mischiefs that had already attended his quarrel with Achilles. But night is urgent, and with night's demands Let all comply. Prepare we now repast, And let the guard be stationed at the trench Without the wall; the youngest shall supply That service; next, Atrides, thou begin (For thou art here supreme) thy proper task. Banquet the elders; it shall not disgrace Thy sovereignty, but shall become thee well. Thy tents are fill'd with wine which day by day Ships bring from Thrace; accommodation large Hast thou, and numerous is thy menial train. Thy many guests assembled, thou shalt hear Our counsel, and shalt chuse the best; great need Have all Achaia's sons, now, of advice Most prudent; for the foe, fast by the fleet Hath kindled numerous fires, which who can see Unmoved? This night shall save us or destroy. He spake, whom all with full consent approved. Forth rush'd the guard well-arm'd; first went the son Of Nestor, Thrasymedes, valiant Chief; Then, sons of Mars, Ascalaphus advanced, And brave Iälmenus; whom follow'd next Deipyrus, Aphareus, Meriones, And Lycomedes, Creon's son renown'd. Seven were the leaders of the guard, and each An hundred spearmen headed, young and bold. Between the wall and trench their seat they chose, There kindled fires, and each his food prepared Atrides, then, to his pavilion led The thronging Chiefs of Greece, and at his board Regaled them; they with readiness and keen Dispatch of hunger shared the savoury feast, And when nor thirst remain'd nor hunger more Unsated, Nestor then, arising first, Whose counsels had been ever wisest deem'd, Warm for the public interest, thus began. Atrides! glorious sovereign! King of men! Thou art my first and last, proem and close, For thou art mighty, and to thee are given From Jove the sceptre and the laws in charge, For the advancement of the general good. Hence, in peculiar, both to speak and hear Become thy duty, and the best advice, By whomsoever offer'd, to adopt And to perform, for thou art judge alone. I will promulge the counsel which to me Seems wisest; such, that other Greecian none Shall give thee better; neither is it new, But I have ever held it since the day When, most illustrious! thou wast pleased to take By force the maid Briseïs from the tent Of the enraged Achilles; not, in truth, By my advice, who did dissuade thee much; But thou complying with thy princely wrath, Hast shamed an Hero whom themselves the Gods Delight to honour, and his prize detain'st. Yet even now contrive we, although late, By lenient gifts liberal, and by speech Conciliatory, to assuage his ire. Then answer'd Agamemnon, King of men. Old Chief! there is no falsehood in thy charge; I have offended, and confess the wrong. The warrior is alone an host, whom Jove Loves as he loves Achilles, for whose sake He hath Achaia's thousands thus subdued. But if the impulse of a wayward mind Obeying, I have err'd, behold me, now, Prepared to sooth him with atonement large Of gifts inestimable, which by name I will propound in presence of you all. Seven tripods, never sullied yet with fire; Of gold ten talents; twenty cauldrons bright; Twelve coursers, strong, victorious in the race; No man possessing prizes such as mine Which they have won for me, shall feel the want Of acquisitions splendid, or of gold. Seven virtuous female captives will I give Expert in arts domestic, Lesbians all, Whom, when himself took Lesbos, I received My chosen portion, passing womankind In perfect loveliness of face and form. These will I give, and will with these resign Her whom I took, Brisëis, with an oath Most solemn, that unconscious as she was Of my embraces, such I yield her his. All these I give him now; and if at length The Gods vouchsafe to us to overturn Priam's great city, let him heap his ships With gold and brass, entering and chusing first When we shall share the spoil. Let him beside Chuse twenty from among the maids of Troy, Helen except, loveliest of all their sex. And if once more, the rich milk-flowing land We reach of Argos, he shall there become My son-in-law, and shall enjoy like state With him whom I in all abundance rear, My only son Orestes. At my home I have three daughters; let him thence conduct To Phthia, her whom he shall most approve. Chrysothemis shall be his bride, or else Laodice; or if she please him more, Iphianassa; and from him I ask No dower, myself will such a dower bestow As never father on his child before. Seven fair well-peopled cities I will give; Cardamyle and Enope, and rich In herbage, Hira; Pheræ stately-built, And for her depth of pasturage renown'd Antheia; proud Æpeia's lofty towers, And Pedasus impurpled dark with vines. All these are maritime, and on the shore They stand of Pylus, by a race possess'd Most rich in flocks and herds, who tributes large, And gifts presenting to his sceptred hand, Shall hold him high in honour as a God. These will I give him if from wrath he cease. Let him be overcome. Pluto alone Is found implacable and deaf to prayer, Whom therefore of all Gods men hate the most. My power is greater, and my years than his More numerous, therefore let him yield to me. To him Gerenian Nestor thus replied. Atrides! glorious sovereign! King of men! No sordid gifts, or to be view'd with scorn, Givest thou the Prince Achilles. But away! Send chosen messengers, who shall the son Of Peleus, instant, in his tent address. Myself will chuse them, be it theirs to obey. Let Phœnix lead, Jove loves him. Be the next Huge Ajax; and the wise Ulysses third. Of heralds, Odius and Eurybates Shall them attend. Bring water for our hands; Give charge that every tongue abstain from speech Portentous, and propitiate Jove by prayer. He spake, and all were pleased. The heralds pour'd Pure water on their hands; attendant youths The beakers crown'd, and wine from right to left Distributed to all. Libation made, All drank, and in such measure as they chose, Then hasted forth from Agamemnon's tent. Gerenian Nestor at their side them oft Instructed, each admonishing by looks Significant, and motion of his eyes, But most Ulysses, to omit no means By which Achilles likeliest might be won. Along the margin of the sounding Deep They pass'd, to Neptune, compasser of earth, Preferring vows ardent with numerous prayers, That they might sway with ease the mighty mind Of fierce Æacides. And now they reach'd The station where his Myrmidons abode. Him solacing they found his heart with notes Struck from his silver-framed harmonious lyre; Among the spoils he found it when he sack'd Eëtion's city; with that lyre his cares He sooth'd and glorious heroes were his theme. Patroclus silent sat, and he alone, Before him, on Æacides intent, Expecting still when he should cease to sing. The messengers advanced (Ulysses first) Into his presence; at the sight, his harp Still in his hand, Achilles from his seat Started astonish'd; nor with less amaze Patroclus also, seeing them, arose. Achilles seized their hands, and thus he spake. Hail friends! ye all are welcome. Urgent cause Hath doubtless brought you, whom I dearest hold, (Though angry still,) of all Achaia's host. So saying, he introduced them, and on seats Placed them with purple arras overspread, Then thus bespake Patroclus standing nigh. Son of Menætius! bring a beaker more Capacious, and replenish it with wine Diluted I have given this sense to the word ?????????—on the authority of the Venetian Scholium, though some contend that it should be translated—quickly. Achilles, who had reproached Agamemnon with intemperate drinking, was, himself, more addicted to music than to wine. less; then give to each his cup; For dearer friends than these who now arrive My roof beneath, or worthier, have I none. He ended, and Patroclus quick obey'd Whom much he loved. Achilles, then, himself Advancing near the fire an ample It is not without authority that I have thus rendered ?????? ????. Homer's banquets are never stewed or boiled; it cannot therefore signify a kettle. It was probably a kitchen-table, dresser, or tray, on which the meat was prepared for the spit. Accordingly we find that this very meat was spitted afterward. —See Schaufelbergerus. tray, Spread goats' flesh on it, with the flesh of sheep And of a fatted brawn; of each a chine. Automedon attending held them fast, While with sharp steel Achilles from the bone Sliced thin the meat, then pierced it with the spits. Meantime the godlike Menætiades Kindled fierce fire, and when the flame declined, Raked wide the embers, lay'd the meat to roast, And taking sacred salt from the hearth-side Where it was treasured, shower'd it o'er the feast. When all was finish'd, and the board set forth, Patroclus furnish'd it around with bread In baskets, and Achilles served the guests. Beside the tent-wall, opposite he sat To the divine Ulysses; first he bade Patroclus make oblation; he consign'd The consecrated morsel to the fire, And each, at once, his savoury mess assail'd. When neither edge of hunger now they felt Nor thirsted longer, Ajax with a nod Made sign to Phœnix, which Ulysses mark'd, And charging high his cup, drank to his host. Health to Achilles! hospitable cheer And well prepared, we want not at the board Of royal Agamemnon, or at thine, For both are nobly spread; but dainties now, Or plenteous boards, are little our concern. Oh godlike Chief! tremendous ills we sit Contemplating with fear, doubtful if life Or death, with the destruction of our fleet, Attend us, unless thou put on thy might. For lo! the haughty Trojans, with their friends Call'd from afar, at the fleet-side encamp, Fast by the wall, where they have kindled fires Numerous, and threaten that no force of ours Shall check their purposed inroad on the ships. Jove grants them favourable signs from heaven, Bright lightnings; Hector glares revenge, with rage Infuriate, and by Jove assisted, heeds Nor God nor man, but prays the morn to rise That he may hew away our vessel-heads, Burn all our fleet with fire, and at their sides Slay the Achaians struggling in the smoke. Horrible are my fears lest these his threats The Gods accomplish, and it be our doom To perish here, from Argos far remote. Up, therefore! if thou canst, and now at last The weary sons of all Achaia save From Trojan violence. Regret, but vain, Shall else be thine hereafter, when no cure Of such great ill, once suffer'd, can be found. Thou therefore, seasonably kind, devise Means to preserve from such disasterous fate The Greecians. Ah, my friend! when Peleus thee From Phthia sent to Agamemnon's aid, On that same day he gave thee thus in charge. “Juno, my son, and Pallas, if they please, Can make thee valiant; but thy own big heart Thyself restrain. Sweet manners win respect. Cease from pernicious strife, and young and old Throughout the host shall honour thee the more.” Such was thy father's charge, which thou, it seems, Remember'st not. Yet even now thy wrath Renounce; be reconciled; for princely gifts Atrides gives thee if thy wrath subside. Hear, if thou wilt, and I will tell thee all, How vast the gifts which Agamemnon made By promise thine, this night within his tent. Seven tripods never sullied yet with fire; Of gold ten talents; twenty cauldrons bright; Twelve steeds strong-limb'd, victorious in the race; No man possessing prizes such as those Which they have won for him, shall feel the want Of acquisitions splendid, or of gold. Seven virtuous female captives he will give, Expert in arts domestic, Lesbians all, Whom when thou conquer'dst Lesbos, he received His chosen portion, passing woman-kind In perfect loveliness of face and form. These will he give, and will with these resign Her whom he took, Briseïs, with an oath Most solemn, that unconscious as she was Of his embraces, such he yields her back. All these he gives thee now! and if at length The Gods vouchsafe to us to overturn Priam's great city, thou shalt heap thy ships With gold and brass, entering and chusing first, When we shall share the spoil; and shalt beside Chuse twenty from among the maids of Troy, Helen except, loveliest of all their sex. And if once more the rich milk-flowing land We reach of Argos, thou shalt there become His son-in-law, and shalt enjoy like state With him, whom he in all abundance rears, His only son Orestes. In his house He hath three daughters; thou may'st home conduct To Phthia, her whom thou shalt most approve. Chrysothemis shall be thy bride; or else Laodice; or if she please thee more Iphianassa; and from thee he asks No dower; himself will such a dower bestow As never father on his child before. Seven fair well-peopled cities will he give; Cardamyle and Enope; and rich In herbage, Hira; Pheræ stately-built, And for her depth of pasturage renown'd, Antheia; proud Æpeia's lofty towers, And Pedasus impurpled dark with vines. All these are maritime, and on the shore They stand of Pylus, by a race possess'd Most rich in flocks and herds, who tribute large And gifts presenting to thy sceptred hand, Shall hold thee high in honour as a God. These will he give thee, if thy wrath subside. But should'st thou rather in thine heart the more Both Agamemnon and his gifts detest, Yet oh compassionate the afflicted host Prepared to adore thee. Thou shalt win renown Among the Greecians that shall never die. Now strike at Hector. He is here;—himself Provokes thee forth; madness is in his heart, And in his rage he glories that our ships Have hither brought no Greecian brave as he. Then thus Achilles matchless in the race. Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd! I must with plainness speak my fixt resolve Unalterable; lest I hear from each The same long murmur'd melancholy tale. For I abhor the man, not more the gates Of hell itself, whose words belie his heart. So shall not mine. My judgement undisguised Is this; that neither Agamemnon me Nor all the Greeks shall move; for ceaseless toil Wins here no thanks; one recompence awaits The sedentary and the most alert, The brave and base in equal honour stand, And drones and heroes fall unwept alike. I after all my labours, who exposed My life continual in the field, have earn'd No very sumptuous prize. As the poor bird Gives to her unfledged brood a morsel gain'd After long search, though wanting it herself, So I have worn out many sleepless nights, And waded deep through many a bloody day In battle for their wives Dacier observes, that he pluralizes the one wife of Menelaus through the impetuosity of his spirit.. I have destroy'd Twelve cities with my fleet, and twelve, save one, On foot contending in the fields of Troy. From all these cities, precious spoils I took Abundant, and to Agamemnon's hand Gave all the treasure. He within his ships Abode the while, and having all received, Little distributed, and much retained; He gave, however, to the Kings and Chiefs A portion, and they keep it. Me alone Of all the Greecian host he hath despoil'd; My bride, my soul's delight is in his hands, And let him, couch'd with her, enjoy his fill Of dalliance. What sufficient cause, what need Have the Achaians to contend with Troy? Why hath Atrides gather'd such an host, And led them hither? Was't not for the sake Of beauteous Helen? And of all mankind Can none be found who love their proper wives But the Atridæ? There is no good man Who loves not, guards not, and with care provides For his own wife, and, though in battle won, I loved the fair Briseïs at my heart. But having dispossess'd me of my prize So foully, let him not essay me now, For I am warn'd, and he shall not prevail. With thee and with thy peers let him advise, Ulysses! how the fleet may likeliest 'scape Yon hostile fires; full many an arduous task He hath accomplish'd without aid of mine; So hath he now this rampart and the trench Which he hath digg'd around it, and with stakes Planted contiguous—puny barriers all To hero-slaughtering Hector's force opposed. While I the battle waged, present myself Among the Achaians, Hector never fought Far from his walls, but to the Scæan gate Advancing and the beech-tree, there remain'd. Once, on that spot he met me, and my arm Escaped with difficulty even there. But, since I feel myself not now inclined To fight with noble Hector, yielding first To Jove due worship, and to all the Gods, To-morrow will I launch, and give my ships Their lading. Look thou forth at early dawn, And, if such spectacle delight thee aught, Thou shalt behold me cleaving with my prows The waves of Hellespont, and all my crews Of lusty rowers, active in their task. So shall I reach (if Ocean's mighty God Prosper my passage) Phthia the deep-soil'd On the third day. I have possessions there, Which hither roaming in an evil hour I left abundant. I shall also hence Convey much treasure, gold and burnish'd brass, And glittering steel, and women passing fair My portion of the spoils. But he, your King, The prize he gave, himself, himself resumed, And taunted at me. Tell him my reply, And tell it him aloud, that other Greeks May indignation feel like me, if arm'd Always in impudence, he seek to wrong Them also. Let him not henceforth presume, Canine and hard in aspect though he be, To look me in the face. I will not share His counsels, neither will I aid his works. Let it suffice him, that he wrong'd me once, Deceived me once, henceforth his glozing arts Are lost on me. But let him rot in peace Crazed as he is, and by the stroke of Jove Infatuate. I detest his gifts, and him So honour, as the thing which most I scorn. And would he give me twenty times the worth Of this his offer, all the treasured heaps Which he possesses, or shall yet possess, All that Orchomenos within her walls, And all that opulent Egyptian Thebes Receives, the city with an hundred gates, Whence twenty thousand chariots rush to war, And would he give me riches as the sands, And as the dust of earth, no gifts from him Should soothe me, till my soul were first avenged For all the offensive licence of his tongue. I will not wed the daughter of your Chief, Of Agamemnon. Could she vie in charms With golden Venus, had she all the skill Of blue-eyed Pallas, even so endow'd She were no bride for me. No. He may chuse From the Achaians some superior Prince, One more her equal. Peleus, if the Gods Preserve me, and I safe arrive at home, Himself, ere long, shall mate me with a bride. In Hellas and in Phthia may be found Fair damsels many, daughters of the Chiefs Who guard our cities; I may chuse of them, And make the loveliest of them all my own. There, in my country, it hath ever been My dearest purpose, wedded to a wife Of rank convenient, to enjoy in peace Such wealth as ancient Peleus hath acquired. For life, in my account, surpasses far In value, all the treasures which report Ascribed to populous Ilium, ere the Greeks Arrived, and while the city yet had peace; Those also which Apollo's marble shrine In rocky Pytho boasts. Fat flocks and beeves May be by force obtain'd, tripods and steeds Are bought or won, but if the breath of man Once overpass its bounds, no force arrests Or may constrain the unbodied spirit back. Me, as my silver-footed mother speaks Thetis, a twofold consummation waits. If still with battle I encompass Troy, I win immortal glory, but all hope Renounce of my return. If I return To my beloved country, I renounce The illustrious meed of glory, but obtain Secure and long immunity from death. And truly I would recommend to all To voyage homeward, for the fall as yet Ye shall not see of Ilium's lofty towers, For that the Thunderer with uplifted arm Protects her, and her courage hath revived. Bear ye mine answer back, as is the part Of good ambassadors, that they may frame Some likelier plan, by which both fleet and host May be preserved; for, my resentment still Burning, this project is but premature. Let Phœnix stay with us, and sleep this night Within my tent, that, if he so incline, He may to-morrow in my fleet embark, And hence attend me; but I leave him free. He ended; they astonish'd at his tone (For vehement he spake) sat silent all, Till Phœnix, aged warrior, at the last Gush'd into tears, (for dread his heart o'erwhelm'd Lest the whole fleet should perish,) and replied. If thou indeed have purposed to return, Noble Achilles! and such wrath retain'st That thou art altogether fixt to leave The fleet a prey to desolating fires, How then, my son! shall I at Troy abide Forlorn of thee? When Peleus, hoary Chief, Sent thee to Agamemnon, yet a child, Unpractised in destructive fight, nor less Of councils ignorant, the schools in which Great minds are form'd, he bade me to the war Attend thee forth, that I might teach thee all, Both elocution and address in arms. Me therefore shalt thou not with my consent Leave here, my son! no, not would Jove himself Promise me, reaping smooth this silver beard, To make me downy-cheek'd as in my youth; Such as when erst from Hellas beauty-famed I fled, escaping from my father's wrath Amyntor, son of Ormenus, who loved A beauteous concubine, and for her sake Despised his wife and persecuted me. My mother suppliant at my knees, with prayer Perpetual importuned me to embrace The damsel first, that she might loath my sire. I did so; and my father soon possess'd With hot suspicion of the fact, let loose A storm of imprecation, in his rage Invoking all the Furies to forbid That ever son of mine should press his knees. Tartarian Jove Pluto. and dread Persephone Proserpine. Fulfill'd his curses; with my pointed spear I would have pierced his heart, but that my wrath Some Deity assuaged, suggesting oft What shame and obloquy I should incur, Known as a parricide through all the land. At length, so treated, I resolved to dwell No longer in his house. My friends, indeed, And all my kindred compass'd me around With much entreaty, wooing me to stay; Oxen and sheep they slaughter'd, many a plump Well-fatted brawn extended in the flames, And drank the old man's vessels to the lees. Nine nights continual at my side they slept, While others watch'd by turns, nor were the fires Extinguish'd ever, one, beneath the porch Of the barr'd hall, and one that from within The vestibule illumed my chamber door. But when the tenth dark night at length arrived, Sudden the chamber doors bursting I flew That moment forth, and unperceived alike By guards and menial women, leap'd the wall. Through spacious Hellas flying thence afar, I came at length to Phthia the deep-soil'd, Mother of flocks, and to the royal house Of Peleus; Peleus with a willing heart Receiving, loved me as a father loves His only son, the son of his old age, Inheritor of all his large demesnes. He made me rich; placed under my controul A populous realm, and on the skirts I dwelt Of Phthia, ruling the Dolopian race. Thee from my soul, thou semblance of the Gods, I loved, and all illustrious as thou art, Achilles! such I made thee. For with me, Me only, would'st thou forth to feast abroad, Nor would'st thou taste thy food at home, 'till first I placed thee on my knees, with my own hand Thy viands carved and fed thee, and the wine Held to thy lips; and many a time, in fits Of infant frowardness, the purple juice Rejecting thou hast deluged all my vest, And fill'd my bosom. Oh, I have endured Much, and have also much perform'd for thee, Thus purposing, that since the Gods vouchsaf'd No son to me, thyself should'st be my son, Godlike Achilles! who should'st screen perchance From a foul fate my else unshelter'd age. Achilles! bid thy mighty spirit down. Thou should'st not be thus merciless; the Gods, Although more honourable, and in power And virtue thy superiors, are themselves Yet placable; and if a mortal man Offend them by transgression of their laws, Libation, incense, sacrifice, and prayer, In meekness offer'd turn their wrath away. Prayers are Jove's daughters, wrinkled Wrinkled—because the countenance of a man driven to prayer by a consciousness of guilt is sorrowful and dejected. Lame—because it is a remedy to which men recur late, and with reluctance. And slant-eyed—either because, in that state of humiliation, they fear to lift their eyes to heaven, or are employed in taking a retrospect of their past misconduct. The whole allegory, considering when and where it was composed, forms a very striking passage., lame, slant-eyed, Which though far distant, yet with constant pace Follow Offence. Offence, robust of limb, And treading firm the ground, outstrips them all, And over all the earth before them runs Hurtful to man. They, following, heal the hurt. Received respectfully when they approach, They help us, and our prayers hear in return. But if we slight, and with obdurate heart Resist them, to Saturnian Jove they cry Against us, supplicating that Offence May cleave to us for vengeance of the wrong. Thou, therefore, O Achilles! honour yield To Jove's own daughters, vanquish'd, as the brave Have ofttimes been, by honour paid to Thee. For came not Agamemnon as he comes With gifts in hand, and promises of more Hereafter; burn'd his anger still the same, I would not move thee to renounce thy own, And to assist us, howsoe'er distress'd. But now, not only are his present gifts Most liberal, and his promises of more Such also, but these Princes he hath sent Charged with entreaties, thine especial friends, And chosen for that cause, from all the host. Slight not their embassy, nor put to shame Their intercession. We confess that once Thy wrath was unreproveable and just. Thus we have heard the heroes of old times Applauded oft, whose anger, though intense, Yet left them open to the gentle sway Of reason and conciliatory gifts. I recollect an ancient history, Which, since all here are friends, I will relate. The brave Ætolians and Curetes met Beneath the walls of Calydon, and fought With mutual slaughter; the Ætolian powers In the defence of Calydon the fair, And the Curetes, bent to lay it waste: That strife Diana of the golden throne Kindled between them, with resentment fired That Oeneus had not in some fertile spot The first fruits of his harvest set apart To her; with hecatombs he entertained All the Divinities of heaven beside, And her alone, daughter of Jove supreme, Or through fergetfulness, or some neglect, Served not; omission careless and profane! She, progeny of Jove, Goddess shaft-arm'd, A savage boar bright-tusk'd in anger sent, Which haunting Oeneus' fields much havoc made. Trees numerous on the earth in heaps he cast Uprooting them, with all their blossoms on. But Meleager, Oeneus' son, at length Slew him, the hunters gathering and the hounds Of numerous cities; for a boar so vast Might not be vanquish'd by the power of few, And many to their funeral piles he sent. Then raised Diana clamorous dispute, And contest hot between them, all alike, Curetes and Ætolians fierce in arms The boar's head claiming, and his bristly hide. So long as warlike Meleager fought, Ætolia prosper'd, nor with all their powers Could the Curetes stand before the walls. But when resentment once had fired the heart Of Meleager, which hath tumult oft Excited in the breasts of wisest men, (For his own mother had his wrath provoked Althæa) thenceforth with his wedded wife He dwelt, fair Cleopatra, close retired. She was Marpessa's daughter, whom she bore To Idas, bravest warrior in his day Of all on earth. He fear'd not 'gainst the King Himself Apollo, for the lovely nymph Marpessa's sake, his spouse, to bend his bow. Her, therefore, Idas and Marpessa named Thenceforth Alcyone, because the fate Of sad Alcyone Marpessa shared, And wept like her, by Phœbus forced away. Thus Meleager, tortured with the pangs Of wrath indulged, with Cleopatra dwelt, Vex'd that his mother cursed him; for, with grief Frantic, his mother importuned the Gods To avenge her slaughter'd brothers She had five brothers: Iphiclus, Polyphontes, Phanes, Eurypylus, Plexippus. on his head. Oft would she smite the earth, while on her knees Seated, she fill'd her bosom with her tears, And call'd on Pluto and dread Proserpine To slay her son; nor vain was that request, But by implacable Erynnis heard Roaming the shades of Erebus. Ere long The tumult and the deafening din of war Roar'd at the gates, and all the batter'd towers Resounded. Then the elders of the town Dispatch'd the high-priests of the Gods to plead With Meleager for his instant aid, With strong assurances of rich reward. Where Calydon afforded fattest soil They bade him chuse to his own use a farm Of fifty measured acres, vineyard half, And half of land commodious for the plough. Him Oeneus also, warrior grey with age, Ascending to his chamber, and his doors Smiting importunate, with earnest prayers Assay'd to soften, kneeling to his son. Nor less his sisters woo'd him to relent, Nor less his mother; but in vain; he grew Still more obdurate. His companions last, The most esteem'd and dearest of his friends, The same suit urged, yet he persisted still Relentless, nor could even they prevail. But when the battle shook his chamber-doors And the Curetes climbing the high towers Had fired the spacious city, then with tears The beauteous Cleopatra, and with prayers Assail'd him; in his view she set the woes Numberless of a city storm'd,—the men Slaughter'd, the city burnt to dust, the chaste Matrons with all their children dragg'd away. That dread recital roused him, and at length Issuing, he put his radiant armour on. Thus Meleager, gratifying first His own resentment from a fatal day Saved the Ætolians, who the promised gift Refused him, and his toils found no reward. But thou my son, be wiser; follow thou No dæmon who would tempt thee to a course Like his; occasion more propitious far Smiles on thee now, than if the fleet were fired. Come, while by gifts invited, and receive From all the host, the honours of a God; For should'st thou, by no gifts induced, at last Enter the bloody field, although thou chase The Trojans hence, yet less shall be thy praise. Then thus Achilles, matchless in the race. Phœnix, my guide, wise, noble and revered! I covet no such glory! the renown Ordain'd by Jove for me, is to resist All importunity to quit my ships While I have power to move, or breath to draw. Hear now, and mark me well. Cease thou from tears. Confound me not, pleading with sighs and sobs In Agamemnon's cause; O love not Him, Lest I renounce thee, who am now thy friend. Assist me rather, as thy duty bids, Him to afflict, who hath afflicted me, So shalt thou share my glory and my power. These shall report as they have heard, but here Rest thou this night, and with the rising morn We will decide, to stay or to depart. He ceased, and silent, by a nod enjoin'd Patroclus to prepare an easy couch For Phœnix, anxious to dismiss the rest Incontinent; when Ajax, godlike son Of Telamon, arising, thus began. Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd! Depart we now; for I perceive that end Or fruit of all our reasonings shall be none. It is expedient also that we bear Our answer back (unwelcome as it is) With all dispatch, for the assembled Greeks Expect us. Brave Achilles shuts a fire Within his breast; the kindness of his friends, And the respect peculiar by ourselves Shown to him, on his heart work no effect. Inexorable man! others accept Even for a brother slain, or for a son Due compensation; the delinquent dwells Secure at home, and the receiver, soothed And pacified, represses his revenge. But thou, resentful of the loss of one, One virgin (such obduracy of heart The Gods have given thee) can'st not be appeased. Yet we assign thee seven in her stead, The most distinguish'd of their sex, and add Large gifts beside. Ah then, at last relent! Respect thy roof; we are thy guests; we come Chosen from the multitude of all the Greeks, Beyond them all ambitious of thy love. To whom Achilles, swiftest of the swift. My noble friend, offspring of Telamon! Thou seem'st sincere, and I believe thee such. But at the very mention of the name Of Atreus' son, who shamed me in the sight Of all Achaia's host, bearing me down As I had been some vagrant at his door, My bosom boils. Return ye and report Your answer. I no thought will entertain Of crimson war, till the illustrious son Of warlike Priam, Hector, blood-embrued, Shall in their tents the Myrmidons assail Themselves, and fire my fleet. At my own ship, And at my own pavilion, it may chance That even Hector's violence shall pause. He ended; they from massy goblets each Libation pour'd, and to the fleet their course Resumed direct, Ulysses at their head. Patroclus then his fellow warriors bade, And the attendant women, spread a couch For Phœnix; they the couch, obedient, spread With fleeces, with rich arras, and with flax Of subtlest woof. There hoary Phœnix lay In expectation of the sacred dawn. Meantime Achilles in the interior tent, With beauteous Diomeda by himself From Lesbos brought, daughter of Phorbas, lay. Patroclus opposite reposed, with whom Slept charming Iphis; her, when he had won The lofty towers of Scyros, the divine Achilles took, and on his friend bestow'd. But when those Chiefs at Agamemnon's tent Arrived, the Greeks on every side arose With golden cups welcoming their return. All question'd them, but Agamemnon first. Oh worthy of Achaia's highest praise, And her chief ornament, Ulysses, speak! Will he defend the fleet? or his big heart Indulging wrathful, doth he still refuse? To whom renown'd Ulysses thus replied. Atrides, Agamemnon, King of men! He, his resentment quenches not, or will, But burns with wrath the more, thee and thy gifts Rejecting both. He bids thee with the Greeks Consult by what expedient thou may'st save The fleet and people, threatening that himself Will at the peep of day launch all his barks, And counselling, beside, the general host To voyage homeward, for that end as yet Of Ilium wall'd to heaven, ye shall not find, Since Jove the Thunderer with uplifted arm Protects her, and her courage hath revived. Thus speaks the Chief, and Ajax is prepared, With the attendant heralds, to report As I have said. But Phœnix in the tent Sleeps of Achilles, who his stay desired, That on the morrow, if he so incline, The hoary warrior may attend him hence Home to his country, but he leaves him free. He ended. They astonish'd at his tone (For vehement he spake) sat silent all. Long silent sat the afflicted sons of Greece, When thus the mighty Diomede began. Atrides, Agamemnon, King of men! Thy supplications to the valiant son Of Peleus, and the offer of thy gifts Innumerous, had been better far withheld. He is at all times haughty, and thy suit Hath but increased his haughtiness of heart Past bounds: but let him stay, or let him go As he shall chuse. He will resume the fight When his own mind shall prompt him, and the Gods Shall urge him forth. Now follow my advice. Ye have refresh'd your hearts with food and wine, Which are the strength of man; take now repose, And when the rosy-finger'd morning fair, Shall shine again, set forth without delay The battle, horse and foot, before the fleet, And where the foremost fight, fight also thou. He ended; all the Kings applauded warm His counsel, and the dauntless tone admired Of Diomede. Then, due libation made, Each sought his tent, and took the gift of sleep. BOOK X. ARGUMENT OF THE TENTH BOOK. Diomede and Ulysses enter the Trojan host by night, and slay Rhesus. All night, the leaders of the host of Greece Lay sunk in soft repose, all, save the Chief, The son of Atreus; him from thought to thought Roving solicitous, no sleep relieved. As when the spouse of beauteous Juno, darts His frequent fires, designing heavy rain Immense, or hail-storm, or field-whitening snow, Or else wide-throated war calamitous, So frequent were the groans by Atreus' son Heaved from his inmost heart, trembling with dread. For cast he but his eye toward the plain Of Ilium, there, astonish'd, he beheld The city fronted with bright fires, and heard Pipes, and recorders, and the hum of war; But when again the Greecian fleet he view'd, And thought on his own people, then his hair Uprooted elevating to the Gods, He from his generous bosom groan'd again. At length he thus resolved; of all the Greeks To seek Neleian Nestor first, with whom He might, perchance, some plan for the defence Of the afflicted Danaï, devise. Rising, he wrapp'd his tunic to his breast, And to his royal feet unsullied bound His sandals; o'er his shoulders, next, he threw Of amplest size a lion's tawny skin That swept his footsteps, dappled o'er with blood, Then took his spear. Meantime not less appall'd Was Menelaus, on whose eyelids sleep Sat not, lest the Achaians for his sake O'er many waters borne, and now intent On glorious deeds, should perish all at Troy. With a pard's spotted hide his shoulders broad He mantled over; to his head he raised His brazen helmet, and with vigorous hand Grasping his spear, forth issued to arouse His brother, mighty sovereign of the host, And by the Greecians like a God revered. He found him at his galley's stern, his arms Assuming radiant; welcome he arrived To Agamemnon, whom he thus address'd. Why arm'st thou, brother? Would'st thou urge abroad Some trusty spy into the Trojan camp? I fear lest none so hardy shall be found As to adventure, in the dead still night, So far, alone; valiant indeed were he! To whom great Agamemnon thus replied. Heaven-favour'd Menelaus! We have need, Thou and myself, of some device well-framed, Which both the Greecians and the fleet of Greece May rescue, for the mind of Jove hath changed, And Hector's prayers alone now reach his ear. I never saw, nor by report have learn'd From any man, that ever single chief Such aweful wonders in one day perform'd As he with ease against the Greeks, although Nor from a Goddess sprung nor from a God. Deeds he hath done, which, as I think, the Greeks Shall deep and long lament, such numerous ills Achaia's host hath at his hands sustain'd. But haste, begone, and at their several ships Call Ajax and Idomeneus; I go To exhort the noble Nestor to arise, That he may visit, if he so incline, The chosen band who watch, and his advice Give them; for him most prompt they will obey, Whose son, together with Meriones, Friend of Idomeneus, controuls them all, Entrusted by ourselves with that command. Him answer'd Menelaus bold in arms. Explain thy purpose.—Would'st thou that I wait Thy coming, there, or thy commands to both Given, that I incontinent return? To whom the Sovereign of the host replied. There stay; lest striking into different paths (For many passes intersect the camp) We miss each other; summon them aloud Where thou shalt come; enjoin them to arise; Call each by his hereditary name, Honouring all. Beware of manners proud, For we ourselves must labour, at our birth By Jove ordain'd to suffering and to toil. So saying, he his brother thence dismiss'd Instructed duly, and, himself, his steps Turned to the tent of Nestor. Him he found Amid his sable galleys in his tent Reposing soft, his armour at his side, Shield, spears, bright helmet, and the broider'd belt Which, when the Senior arm'd led forth his host To fight, he wore; for he complied not yet With the encroachments of enfeebling age. He raised his head, and on his elbow propp'd, Questioning Agamemnon, thus began. But who art thou, who thus alone, the camp Roamest, amid the darkness of the night, While other mortals sleep? Comest thou abroad Seeking some friend or soldier of the guard? Speak—come not nearer mute. What is thy wish? To whom the son of Atreus, King of men. Oh Nestor, glory of the Greecian name, Offspring of Neleus! thou in me shalt know The son of Atreus, Agamemnon, doom'd By Jove to toil, while life shall yet inform These limbs, or I shall draw the vital air. I wander thus, because that on my lids Sweet sleep sits not, but war and the concerns Of the Achaians occupy my soul. Terrible are the fears which I endure For these my people; such as supersede All thought; my bosom can no longer hold My throbbing heart, and tremors shake my limbs. But if thy mind, more capable, project Aught that may profit us (for thee it seems Sleep also shuns) arise, and let us both Visit the watch, lest, haply, overtoil'd They yield to sleep, forgetful of their charge. The foe is posted near, and may intend (None knows his purpose) an assault by night. To him Gerenian Nestor thus replied. Illustrious Agamemnon, King of men! Deep-planning Jove the imaginations proud Of Hector will not ratify, nor all His sanguine hopes effectuate; in his turn He also (fierce Achilles once appeased) Shall trouble feel, and, haply, more than we. But with all readiness I will arise And follow thee, that we may also rouse Yet others; Diomede the spear-renown'd, Ulysses, the swift Ajax, and the son Of Phyleus, valiant Meges. It were well Were others also visited and call'd, The Godlike Ajax, and Idomeneus, Whose ships are at the camp's extremest bounds. But though I love thy brother and revere, And though I grieve e'en thee, yet speak I must, And plainly censure him, that thus he sleeps And leaves to thee the labour, who himself Should range the host, soliciting the Chiefs Of every band, as utmost need requires. Him answer'd Agamemnon, King of men. Old warrior, times there are, when I could wish Myself thy censure of him, for in act He is not seldom tardy and remiss. Yet is not sluggish indolence the cause, No, nor stupidity, but he observes Me much, expecting till I lead the way. But he was foremost now, far more alert This night than I, and I have sent him forth Already, those to call whom thou hast named. But let us hence, for at the guard I trust To find them, since I gave them so in charge. To whom the brave Gerenian Chief replied. Him none will censure, or his will dispute, Whom he shall waken and exhort to rise. So saying, he bound his corslet to his breast, His sandals fair to his unsullied feet, And fastening by its clasps his purple cloak Around him, double and of shaggy pile, Seized, next, his sturdy spear headed with brass, And issued first, into the Greecian fleet. There, Nestor, brave Gerenian, with a voice Sonorous roused the Godlike counsellor From sleep, Ulysses; the alarm came o'er His startled ear, forth from his tent he sprang Sudden, and of their coming, quick, enquired. Why roam ye thus the camp and fleet alone In darkness? by what urgent need constrain'd? To whom the hoary Pylian thus replied. Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd! Resent it not, for dread is our distress. Come, therefore, and assist us to convene Yet others, qualified to judge if war Be most expedient, or immediate flight. He ended, and regaining, quick, his tent, Ulysses slung his shield, then coming forth Join'd them. The son of Tydeus first they sought. Him sleeping arm'd before his tent they found, Encompass'd by his friends also asleep; His head each rested on his shield, and each Had planted on its nether point ????????—seems to have been a hollow iron with a point, fitted to the obtuse end of the spear for the purpose of planting that end of it in the ground. It might probably be taken off at pleasure. erect His spear beside him; bright their polish'd heads, As Jove's own lightning glitter'd from afar. Himself, the Hero, slept. A wild bull's hide Was spread beneath him, and on arras tinged With splendid purple lay his head reclined. Nestor, beside him standing, with his heel Shook him, and, urgent, thus the Chief reproved. Awake, Tydides! wherefore givest the night Entire to balmy slumber? Hast not heard How on the rising ground beside the fleet The Trojans sit, small interval between? He ceased; then upsprang Diomede alarm'd Instant, and in wing'd accents thus replied. Old wakeful Chief! thy toils are never done. Are there not younger of the sons of Greece, Who ranging in all parts the camp, might call The Kings to council? But no curb controuls Or can abate activity like thine. To whom Gerenian Nestor in return. My friend! thou hast well spoken. I have sons, And they are well deserving; I have here A numerous people also, one of whom Might have sufficed to call the Kings of Greece. But such occasion presses now the host As hath not oft occurr'd: the overthrow Complete, or full deliverance of us all, In balance hangs, poised on a razor's edge. But haste, and if thy pity of my toils Be such, since thou art younger, call, thyself, Ajax the swift, and Meges to the guard. Then Diomede a lion's tawny skin Around him wrapp'd, dependent to his heels, And, spear in hand, set forth. The Hero call'd Those two, and led them whither Nestor bade. They, at the guard arrived, not sleeping found The captains of the guard, but sitting all In vigilant posture with their arms prepared. As dogs that, careful, watch the fold by night, Hearing some wild beast in the woods, which hounds And hunters with tumultuous clamour drive Down from the mountain-top, all sleep forego; So, sat not on their eyelids gentle sleep That dreadful night, but constant to the plain At every sound of Trojan feet they turn'd. The old Chief joyful at the sight, in terms Of kind encouragement them thus address'd. So watch, my children! and beware that sleep Invade none here, lest all become a prey. So saying, he traversed with quick pace the trench By every Chief whom they had thither call'd Attended, with whom Nestor's noble son Went, and Meriones, invited both To join their consultation. From the foss Emerging, in a vacant space they sat, Unstrew'd with bodies of the slain, the spot Whence furious Hector, after slaughter made Of numerous Greeks, night falling, had return'd. There seated, mutual converse close they held, And Nestor, brave Gerenian, thus began. Oh friends! hath no Achaian here such trust In his own prowess, as to venture forth Among yon haughty Trojans? He, perchance, Might on the borders of their host surprise Some wandering adversary, or might learn Their consultations, whether they propose Here to abide in prospect of the fleet, Or, satiate with success against the Greeks So signal, meditate retreat to Troy. These tidings gain'd, should he at last return Secure, his recompence will be renown Extensive as the heavens, and fair reward. From every leader of the fleet, his gift Shall be a sable Sable, because the expedition was made by night, and each with a lamb, as typical of the fruit of their labours. ewe, and sucking lamb, Rare acquisition! and at every board And sumptuous banquet, he shall be a guest. He ceased, and all sat silent, when at length The mighty son of Tydeus thus replied. Me, Nestor, my courageous heart incites To penetrate into the neighbour host Of enemies; but went some other Chief With me, far greater would my comfort prove, And I should dare the more. Two going forth, One quicker sees than other, and suggests Prudent advice; but he who single goes, Mark whatsoe'er he may, the occasion less Improves, and his expedients soon exhausts. He ended, and no few willing arose To go with Diomede. Servants of Mars Each Ajax willing stood; willing as they Meriones; most willing Nestor's son; Willing the brother of the Chief of all, Nor willing less Ulysses to explore The host of Troy, for he possess'd a heart Delighted ever with some bold exploit. Then Agamemnon, King of men, began. Now Diomede, in whom my soul delights! Chuse whom thou wilt for thy companion; chuse The fittest here; for numerous wish to go. Leave not through deference to another's rank, The more deserving, nor prefer a worse, Respecting either pedigree or power. Such speech he interposed, fearing his choice Of Menelaus; then, renown'd in arms The son of Tydeus, rising, spake again. Since, then, ye bid me my own partner chuse Free from constraint, how can I overlook Divine Ulysses, whose courageous heart With such peculiar cheerfulness endures Whatever toils, and whom Minerva loves? Let Him attend me, and through fire itself We shall return; for none is wise as he. To him Ulysses, hardy Chief, replied. Tydides! neither praise me much, nor blame, For these are Greecians in whose ears thou speak'st, And know me well. But let us hence! the night Draws to a close; day comes apace; the stars Are far advanced; two portions have elapsed Of darkness, but the third is yet entire. So they; then each his dreadful arms put on. To Diomede, who at the fleet had left His own, the dauntless Thrasymedes gave His shield and sword two-edged, and on his head Placed, crestless, unadorn'd, his bull-skin casque. It was a stripling's helmet, such as youths Scarce yet confirm'd in lusty manhood, wear. Meriones with quiver, bow and sword Furnish'd Ulysses, and his brows enclosed In his own casque of hide with many a thong Well braced within; guarded it was without With boar's teeth ivory-white inherent firm On all sides, and with wollen head-piece lined. That helmet erst Autolycus Autolycus was grandfather of Ulysses by the mother's side. had brought From Eleon, city of Amyntor son Of Hormenus, where he the solid walls Bored through, clandestine, of Amyntor's house. He on Amphidamas the prize bestow'd In Scandia; from Amphidamas it pass'd To Molus as an hospitable pledge; He gave it to Meriones his son, And now it guarded shrewd Ulysses' brows. Both clad in arms terrific, forth they sped, Leaving their fellow Chiefs, and as they went An heron, by command of Pallas, flew Close on the right beside them; darkling they Discern'd him not, but heard his clanging plumes. Ulysses in the favourable sign Exulted, and Minerva thus invoked. Oh hear me, daughter of Jove Ægis-arm'd! My present helper in all streights, whose eye Marks all my ways, oh with peculiar care Now guard me, Pallas! grant that after toil Successful, glorious, such as long shall fill With grief the Trojans, we may safe return And with immortal honours to the fleet. Valiant Tydides, next, his prayer preferr'd. Hear also me, Jove's offspring by the toils Of war invincible! me follow now As my heroic father erst to Thebes Thou followedst, Tydeus; by the Greeks dispatch'd Ambassador, he left the mail-clad host Beside Asopus, and with terms of peace Entrusted, enter'd Thebes; but by thine aid Benevolent, and in thy strength, perform'd Returning, deeds of terrible renown. Thus, now, protect me also! In return I vow an offering at thy shrine, a young Broad-fronted heifer, to the yoke as yet Untamed, whose horns I will incase with gold. Such prayer they made, and Pallas heard well pleased. Their orisons ended to the daughter dread Of mighty Jove, lion-like they advanced Through shades of night, through carnage, arms and blood. Nor Hector to his gallant host indulged Sleep, but convened the leaders; leader none Or senator of all his host he left Unsummon'd, and his purpose thus promulged. Where is the warrior who for rich reward, Such as shall well suffice him, will the task Adventurous, which I propose, perform? A chariot with two steeds of proudest height, Surpassing all in the whole fleet of Greece Shall be his portion, with immortal praise, Who shall the well-appointed ships approach Courageous, there to learn if yet a guard As heretofore, keep them, or if subdued Beneath us, the Achaians flight intend, And worn with labour have no will to watch. So Hector spake, but answer none return'd. There was a certain Trojan, Dolon named, Son of Eumedes herald of the Gods, Rich both in gold and brass, but in his form Unsightly; yet the man was swift of foot, Sole brother of five sisters; he his speech To Hector and the Trojans thus address'd. My spirit, Hector, prompts me, and my mind Endued with manly vigour, to approach Yon gallant ships, that I may tidings hear. But come. For my assurance, lifting high Thy sceptre, swear to me, for my reward, The horses and the brazen chariot bright Which bear renown'd Achilles o'er the field. I will not prove an useless spy, nor fall Below thy best opinion; pass I will Their army through, 'till I shall reach the ship Of Agamemnon, where the Chiefs, perchance, Now sit consulting, or to fight, or fly. Then raising high his sceptre, Hector sware. Know, Jove himself, Juno's high-thundering spouse! That Trojan none shall in that chariot ride By those steeds drawn, save Dolon; on my oath I make them thine; enjoy them evermore. He said, and falsely sware, yet him assured. Then Dolon, instant, o'er his shoulder slung His bow elastic, wrapp'd himself around With a grey wolf-skin, to his head a casque Adjusted, coated o'er with ferret's felt, And seizing his sharp javelin, from the host Turn'd right toward the fleet, but was ordain'd To disappoint his sender, and to bring No tidings thence. The throng of Trojan steeds And warriors left, with brisker pace he moved, When brave Ulysses his approach perceived, And thus to Diomede his speech address'd. Tydides! yonder man is from the host; Either a spy he comes, or with intent To spoil the dead. First, freely let him pass Few paces, then pursuing him with speed, Seize on him suddenly; but should he prove The nimbler of the three, with threatening spear Enforce him from his camp toward the fleet, Lest he elude us, and escape to Troy. So they; then, turning from the road oblique, Among the carcases each lay'd him down. Dolon, suspecting nought, ran swiftly by. Commentators here are extremely in the dark, and even Aristarchus seems to have attempted an explanation in vain.—The Translator does not pretend to have ascertained the distance intended, but only to have given a distance suited to the occasion.But when such space was interposed as mules Plow in a day, (for mules the ox surpass Through fallows deep drawing the ponderous plough) Both ran toward him. Dolon at the sound Stood; for he hoped some Trojan friends at hand From Hector sent to bid him back again. But when within spear's cast, or less they came, Knowing them enemies he turn'd to flight Incontinent, whom they as swift pursued. As two fleet hounds sharp fang'd, train'd to the chace, Hang on the rear of flying hind or hare, And drive her, never swerving from the track, Through copses close; she screaming scuds before; So Diomede and dread Ulysses him Chased constant, intercepting his return. And now, fast-fleeing to the ships, he soon Had reach'd the guard, but Pallas with new force Inspired Tydides, lest a meaner Greek Should boast that he had smitten Dolon first. And Diomede win only second praise. He poised his lifted spear, and thus exclaim'd. Stand! or my spear shall stop thee. Death impends At every step; thou can'st not 'scape me long. He said, and threw his spear, but by design, Err'd from the man. The polish'd weapon swift O'er-glancing his right shoulder, in the soil Stood fixt, beyond him. Terrified he stood, Stammering, and sounding through his lips the clash Of chattering teeth, with visage deadly wan. They panting rush'd on him, and both his hands Seized fast; he wept, and suppliant them bespake. Take me alive, and I will pay the price Of my redemption. I have gold at home, Brass also, and bright steel, and when report Of my captivity within your fleet Shall reach my father, treasures he will give Not to be told, for ransom of his son. To whom Ulysses politic replied. Take courage; entertain no thought of death. But haste! this tell me, and disclose the truth. Why thus toward the ships comest thou alone From yonder host, by night, while others sleep? To spoil some carcase? or from Hector sent A spy of all that passes in the fleet? Or by thy curiosity impell'd? Then Dolon, his limbs trembling, thus replied. To my great detriment, and far beyond My own design, Hector trepann'd me forth, Who promised me the steeds of Peleus' son Illustrious, and his brazen chariot bright. He bade me, under night's fast-flitting shades Approach our enemies, a spy, to learn If still as heretofore, ye station guards For safety of your fleet, or if subdued Completely, ye intend immediate flight, And worn with labour, have no will to watch. To whom Ulysses, smiling, thus replied. Thou hadst, in truth, an appetite to gifts Of no mean value, coveting the steeds Of brave Æacides; but steeds are they Of fiery sort, difficult to be ruled By force of mortal man, Achilles' self Except, whom an immortal mother bore. But tell me yet again; use no disguise; Where left'st thou, at thy coming forth, your Chief, The valiant Hector? where hath he disposed His armour battle-worn, and where his steeds? What other quarters of your host are watch'd? Where lodge the guard, and what intend ye next? Still to abide in prospect of the fleet? Or well-content that ye have thus reduced Achaia's host, will ye retire to Troy? To whom this answer Dolon straight returned Son of Eumedes. With unfeigning truth Simply and plainly will I utter all. Hector, with all the Senatorial Chiefs, Beside the tomb of sacred Ilius sits Consulting, from the noisy camp remote. But for the guards, Hero! concerning whom Thou hast enquired, there is no certain watch And regular appointed o'er the camp; The native ????? ??? ????? ????? ???????—As many as are owners of hearths,—that is to say, all who are householders here, or natives of the city. Trojans (for they can no less) Sit sleepless all, and each his next exhorts To vigilance; but all our foreign aids, Who neither wives nor children hazard here, Trusting the Trojans for that service, sleep. To whom Ulysses, ever wise, replied. How sleep the strangers, and allies?—apart? Or with the Trojans mingled?—I would learn. So spake Ulysses; to whom Dolon thus, Son of Eumedes. I will all unfold, And all most truly. By the sea are lodged The Carians, the Pæonians arm'd with bows, The Leleges, with the Pelasgian band, And the Caucones. On the skirts encamp Of Thymbra, the Mæonians crested high, The Phrygian horsemen, with the Lycian host, And the bold troop of Mysia's haughty sons. But wherefore these enquiries, thus minute? For if ye wish to penetrate the host, These who possess the borders of the camp Farthest removed of all, are Thracian powers Newly arrived; among them Rhesus sleeps, Son of Eïoneus, their Chief and King. His steeds I saw, the fairest by these eyes Ever beheld, and loftiest; snow itself They pass in whiteness, and in speed the winds. With gold and silver all his chariot burns, And he arrived in golden armour clad Stupendous! little suited to the state Of mortal man—fit for a God to wear! Now, either lead me to your gallant fleet, Or, where ye find me, leave me straitly bound Till ye return, and, after trial made, Shall know if I have spoken false or true. But him brave Diomede with aspect stern Answer'd. Since, Dolon! thou art caught, although Thy tidings have been good, hope not to live; For should we now release thee and dismiss, Thou wilt revisit yet again the fleet A spy or open foe; but smitten once By this death-dealing arm, thou shalt return To render mischief to the Greeks no more. He ceased, and Dolon would have stretch'd his hand Toward his beard, and pleaded hard for life, But with his faulchion, rising to the blow, On the mid-neck he smote him, cutting sheer Both tendons with a stroke so swift, that ere His tongue had ceased, his head was in the dust. They took his helmet clothed with ferret's felt, Stripp'd off his wolf-skin, seized his bow and spear, And brave Ulysses lifting in his hand The trophy to Minerva, pray'd and said: Hail Goddess; these are thine! for thee of all Who in Olympus dwell, we will invoke First to our aid. Now also guide our steps, Propitious, to the Thracian tents and steeds. He ceased, and at arm's-length the lifted spoils Hung on a tamarisk; but mark'd the spot, Plucking away with hand-full grasp the reeds And spreading boughs, lest they should seek the prize Themselves in vain, returning ere the night, Swift traveller, should have fled before the dawn. Thence, o'er the bloody champain strew'd with arms Proceeding, to the Thracian lines they came. They, wearied, slept profound; beside them lay, In triple order regular arranged, Their radiant armour, and their steeds in pairs. Amid them Rhesus slept, and at his side His coursers, to the outer chariot-ring Fasten'd secure. Ulysses saw him first, And, seeing, mark'd him out to Diomede. Behold the man, Tydides! Lo! the steeds By Dolon specified whom we have slain. Be quick. Exert thy force. Arm'd as thou art, Sleep not. Loose thou the steeds, or slaughter thou The Thracians, and the steeds shall be my care. He ceased; then blue-eyed Pallas with fresh force Invigour'd Diomede. From side to side He slew; dread groans arose of dying men Hewn with the sword, and the earth swam with blood. As if he find a flock unguarded, sheep Or goats, the lion rushes on his prey, With such unsparing force Tydides smote The men of Thrace, till he had slaughter'd twelve; And whom Tydides with his faulchion struck Laertes' son dragg'd by his feet abroad, Forecasting that the steeds might pass with ease, Nor start, as yet uncustom'd to the dead. But when the son of Tydeus found the King, Him also panting forth his last, last breath, He added to the twelve; for at his head An evil dream that night had stood, the form Of Diomede, by Pallas' art devised. Meantime, the bold Ulysses loosed the steeds, Which, to each other rein'd, he drove abroad, Smiting them with his bow, (for of the scourge He thought not in the chariot-seat secured,) And as he went, hiss'd, warning Diomede. But he, projecting still some hardier deed, Stood doubtful, whether by the pole to draw The chariot thence, laden with gorgeous arms, Or whether heaving it on high, to bear The burthen off, or whether yet to take More Thracian lives; when him with various thoughts Perplex'd, Minerva, drawing near, bespake. Son of bold Tydeus! think on thy return To yonder fleet, lest thou depart constrain'd. Some other God may rouse the powers of Troy. She ended, and he knew the voice divine. At once he mounted. With his bow the steeds Ulysses plyed, and to the ships they flew. Nor look'd the bender of the silver bow, Apollo, forth in vain, but at the sight Of Pallas following Diomede incensed, Descended to the field where numerous most He saw the Trojans, and the Thracian Chief And counsellor, Hippocoön aroused, Kinsman of Rhesus, and renown'd in arms. He, starting from his sleep, soon as he saw The spot deserted where so lately lay Those fiery coursers, and his warrior friends Gasping around him, sounded loud the name Of his loved Rhesus. Instant, at the voice, Wild stir arose and clamorous uproar Of fast-assembling Trojans. Deeds they saw— Terrible deeds, and marvellous perform'd, But not their authors—they had sought the ships. Meantime arrived where they had slain the spy Of Hector, there Ulysses, dear to Jove, The coursers stay'd, and, leaping to the ground, The son of Tydeus in Ulysses' hands The arms of Dolon placed foul with his blood, Then vaulted light into his seat again. He lash'd the steeds, they, not unwilling, flew To the deep-bellied barks, as to their home. First Nestor heard the sound, and thus he said. Friends! Counsellors! and leaders of the Greeks! False shall I speak, or true?—but speak I must. The echoing sound of hoofs alarms my ear. Oh, that Ulysses, and brave Diomede This moment might arrive drawn into camp By Trojan steeds! But ah, the dread I feel! Lest some disaster have for ever quell'd In yon rude host those noblest of the Greeks. He had not ended, when themselves arrived. Both quick dismounted; joy at their return Fill'd every bosom; each with kind salute Cordial, and right-hand welcome greeted them, And first Gerenian Nestor thus enquired. Oh Chief by all extoll'd, glory of Greece, Ulysses! how have ye these steeds acquired? In yonder host? or met ye as ye went Some God who gave them to you? for they show A lustre dazzling as the beams of day. Old as I am, I mingle yet in fight With Ilium's sons,—lurk never in the fleet— Yet saw I at no time, or have remark'd Steeds such as these; which therefore I believe Perforce, that ye have gained by gift divine; For cloud-assembler Jove, and azure-eyed Minerva, Jove's own daughter, love you both. To whom Ulysses, thus, discrete, replied. Neleian Nestor, glory of the Greeks! A God, so willing, could have given us steeds Superior, for their bounty knows no bounds. But, venerable Chief! these which thou seest Are Thracians new-arrived. Their master lies Slain by the valiant Diomede, with twelve The noblest of his warriors at his side. A thirteenth Homer did not here forget himself, though some have altered ???? to ???????????????.—Rhesus for distinction sake is not numbered with his people. —See Villoisson in loco. also, at small distance hence We slew, by Hector and the Chiefs of Troy Sent to inspect the posture of our host. He said; then, high in exultation, drove The coursers o'er the trench, and with him pass'd The glad Achaians; at the spacious tent Of Diomede arrived, with even thongs They tied them at the cribs where stood the steeds Of Tydeus' son, with winnow'd wheat supplied. Ulysses in his bark the gory spoils Of Dolon placed, designing them a gift To Pallas. Then, descending to the sea, Neck, thighs, and legs from sweat profuse they cleansed, And, so refresh'd and purified, their last Ablution in bright tepid baths perform'd. Each thus completely laved, and with smooth oil Anointed, at the well-spread board they sat, And quaff'd, in honour of Minerva, wine Delicious, from the brimming beaker drawn. BOOK XI. ARGUMENT OF THE ELEVENTH BOOK. Agamemnon distinguishes himself. He is wounded, and retires. Diomede is wounded by Paris; Ulysses by Socus. Ajax with Menelaus flies to the relief of Ulysses, and Eurypylus, soon after, to the relief of Ajax. While he is employed in assisting Ajax, he is shot in the thigh by Paris, who also wounds Machaon. Nestor conveys Machaon from the field. Achilles dispatches Patroclus to the tent of Nestor, and Nestor takes that occasion to exhort Patroclus to engage in battle, cloathed in the armour of Achilles. Aurora from Tithonus' side arose With light for heaven and earth, when Jove dispatch'd Discord, the fiery signal in her hand Of battle bearing, to the Greecian fleet. High on Ulysses' huge black ship she stood The centre of the fleet, whence all might hear, The tent of Telamon's huge son between, And of Achilles; for confiding they In their heroic fortitude, their barks Well-poised had station'd utmost of the line. There standing, shrill she sent a cry abroad Among the Achaians, such as thirst infused Of battle ceaseless into every breast. All deem'd, at once, war sweeter, than to seek Their native country through the waves again. Then with loud voice Atrides bade the Greeks Gird on their armour, and himself his arms Took radiant. First around his legs he clasp'd His shining greaves with silver studs secured, Then bound his corslet to his bosom, gift Of Cynyras long since; for rumour loud Had Cyprus reached of an Achaian host Assembling, destined to the shores of Troy, Wherefore, to gratify the King of men, He made the splendid ornament his own. Ten rods of steel cœrulean all around Embraced it, twelve of gold, twenty of tin; Six ????? ????????,—Three on a side. This is evidently the proper punctuation, though it differs from that of all the editions that I have seen. I find it no where but in the Venetian Scholium. spiry serpents their uplifted heads Cœrulean darted at the wearer's throat, Splendour diffusing as the various bow Fix'd by Saturnian Jove in showery clouds, A sign to mortal men. He slung his sword Athwart his shoulders; dazzling bright it shone With gold emboss'd, and silver was the sheath Suspended graceful in a belt of gold. His massy shield o'ershadowing him whole, High-wrought and beautiful, he next assumed. Ten circles bright of brass around its field Extensive, circle within circle, ran; The central boss was black, but hemm'd about With twice ten bosses of resplendent tin. There, dreadful ornament! the visage dark Of Gorgon scowl'd, border'd by Flight and Fear. The loop was silver, and a serpent form Cœrulean over all its surface twined, Three heads erecting on one neck, the heads Together wreath'd into a stately crown. His helmet quatre-crested Quâtre-crested. So I have rendered ????????????, which literally signifies having four cones. The cone was a tube into which the crest was inserted. The word quâtre-crested may need a precedent for its justification, and seems to have a sufficient one in the cinque-spotted cowslip of Shakspeare., and with studs Fast rivetted around he to his brows Adjusted, whence tremendous waved his crest Of mounted hair on high. Two spears he seized Ponderous, brass-pointed, and that flash'd to heaven. Sounds This seems the proper import of ??????????. Jupiter is called ??????????. like clear thunder, by the spouse of Jove And by Minerva raised to extol the King Of opulent Mycenæ, roll'd around. At once each bade his charioteer his steeds Hold fast beside the margin of the trench In orderly array; the foot all arm'd Rush'd forward, and the clamour of the host Rose infinite into the dawning skies. First, at the trench, the embattled infantry The Translator follows Clarke in this interpretation of a passage to us not very intelligible. Stood ranged; the chariots followed close behind; Dire was the tumult by Saturnian Jove Excited, and from ether down he shed Blood-tinctured dews among them, for he meant That day to send full many a warrior bold To Pluto's dreary realm, slain premature. Opposite, on the rising-ground, appear'd The Trojans; them majestic Hector led, Noble Polydamas, Æneas raised To Godlike honours in all Trojan hearts, And Polybus, with whom Antenor's sons Agenor, and young Acamas advanced. Hector the splendid orb of his broad shield Bore in the van, and as a comet now Glares through the clouds portentous, and again, Obscured by gloomy vapours, disappears, So Hector, marshalling his host, in front Now shone, now vanish'd in the distant rear. All-cased he flamed in brass, and on the sight Flash'd as the lightnings of Jove Ægis-arm'd. As reapers, toiling opposite, lay bare Some rich man's furrows, while the sever'd grain, Barley or wheat, sinks as the sickle moves, So Greeks and Trojans springing into fight Slew mutual; foul retreat alike they scorn'd, Alike in fierce hostility their heads Both bore aloft, and rush'd like wolves to war. Discord, spectatress terrible, that sight Beheld exulting; she, of all the Gods, Alone was present; not a Power beside There interfered, but each his bright abode Quiescent occupied wherever built Among the windings of the Olympian heights; Yet blamed they all the storm-assembler King Saturnian, for his purposed aid to Troy. The eternal father reck'd not; he, apart, Seated in solitary pomp, enjoy'd His glory, and from on high the towers survey'd Of Ilium and the fleet of Greece, the flash Of gleaming arms, the slayer and the slain. While morning lasted, and the light of day Increased, so long the weapons on both sides Flew in thick vollies, and the people fell. But, what time his repast the woodman spreads In some umbrageous vale, his sinewy arms Wearied with hewing many a lofty tree, And his wants satisfied, he feels at length The pinch of appetite to pleasant food, Then was it, that encouraging aloud Each other, in their native virtue strong, The Greecians through the phalanx burst of Troy. Forth sprang the monarch first; he slew the Chief Bianor, nor himself alone, but slew Oïleus also driver of his steeds. Oïleus, with a leap alighting, rush'd On Agamemnon; he his fierce assault Encountering, with a spear met full his front. Nor could his helmet's ponderous brass sustain That force, but both his helmet and his scull It shatter'd, and his martial rage repress'd. The King of men, stripping their corslets, bared Their shining breasts, and left them. Isus, next, And Antiphus he flew to slay, the sons Of Priam both, and in one chariot borne, This spurious, genuine that. The bastard drove, And Antiphus, a warrior high-renown'd, Fought from the chariot; them Achilles erst Feeding their flocks on Ida had surprized And bound with osiers, but for ransom loosed. Of these, imperial Agamemnon, first, Above the pap pierced Isus; next, he smote Antiphus with his sword beside the ear, And from his chariot cast him to the ground. Conscious of both, their glittering arms he stripp'd, For he had seen them when from Ida's heights Achilles led them to the Greecian fleet. As with resistless fangs the lion breaks The young in pieces of the nimble hind, Entering her lair, and takes their feeble lives; She, though at hand, can yield them no defence, But through the thick wood, wing'd with terror, starts Herself away, trembling at such a foe; So them the Trojans had no power to save, Themselves all driven before the host of Greece. Next, on Pisandrus, and of dauntless heart Hippolochus he rush'd; they were the sons Of brave Antimachus, who with rich gifts By Paris bought, inflexible withheld From Menelaus still his lovely bride. His sons, the monarch, in one chariot borne Encounter'd; they (for they had lost the reins) With trepidation and united force Essay'd to check the steeds; astonishment Seized both; Atrides with a lion's rage Came on, and from the chariot thus they sued. Oh spare us! son of Atreus, and accept Ransom immense. Antimachus our sire Is rich in various treasure, gold and brass, And temper'd steel, and, hearing the report That in Achaia's fleet his sons survive, He will requite thee with a glorious price. So they, with tears and gentle terms the King Accosted, but no gentle answer heard. Are ye indeed the offspring of the Chief Antimachus, who when my brother once With Godlike Laertiades your town Enter'd ambassador, his death advised In council, and to let him forth no more? Now rue ye both the baseness of your sire. He said, and from his chariot to the plain Thrust down Pisandrus, piercing with keen lance His bosom, and supine he smote the field. Down leap'd Hippolochus, whom on the ground He slew; cut sheer his hands, and lopp'd his head, And roll'd it like a mortar ?????. through the ranks. He left the slain, and where he saw the field With thickest battle cover'd, thither flew By all the Greecians follow'd bright in arms. The scatter'd infantry constrained to fly, Fell by the infantry; the charioteers, While with loud hoofs their steeds the dusty soil Excited, o'er the charioteers their wheels Drove brazen-fellied, and the King of men Incessant slaughtering, called his Argives The Greecians at large are indiscriminately called Danaï, Argives, and Achaians, in the original. The Phthians in particular—Hellenes. They were the troops of Achilles. on. As when fierce flames some ancient forest seize, From side to side in flakes the various wind Rolls them, and to the roots devour'd, the trunks Fall prostrate under fury of the fire, So under Agamemnon fell the heads Of flying Trojans. Many a courser proud The empty chariots through the paths of war Whirl'd rattling, of their charioteers deprived; They breathless press'd the plain, now fitter far To feed the vultures than to cheer their wives. Conceal'd, meantime, by Jove, Hector escaped The dust, darts, deaths, and tumult of the field, And Agamemnon to the swift pursuit Call'd loud the Greecians. Through the middle plain Beside the sepulchre of Ilus, son Of Dardanus, and where the fig-tree stood, The Trojans flew, panting to gain the town, While Agamemnon pressing close the rear, Shout after shout terrific sent abroad, And his victorious hands reek'd, red with gore. But at the beech-tree and the Scæan gate Arrived, the Trojans halted, waiting there The rearmost fugitives; they o'er the field Came like a herd, which in the dead of night A lion drives; all fly, but one is doom'd To death inevitable; her with jaws True to their hold he seizes, and her neck Breaking, embowels her, and laps the blood; So, Atreus' royal son, the hindmost still Slaying, and still pursuing, urged them on. Many supine, and many prone, the field Press'd, by the son of Atreus in their flight Dismounted; for no weapon raged as his. But now, at last, when he should soon have reach'd The lofty walls of Ilium, came the Sire Of Gods and men descending from the skies, And on the heights of Ida fountain-fed, Sat arm'd with thunders. Calling to his foot Swift Iris golden-pinion'd, thus he spake. Iris! away. Thus speak in Hector's ears. While yet he shall the son of Atreus see Fierce warring in the van, and mowing down The Trojan ranks, so long let him abstain From battle, leaving to his host the task Of bloody contest furious with the Greeks. But soon as Atreus' son by spear or shaft Wounded shall climb his chariot, with such force I will endue Hector, that he shall slay Till he have reach'd the ships, and till, the sun Descending, sacred darkness cover all. He spake, nor rapid Iris disobey'd Storm-wing'd embassadress, but from the heights Of Ida stoop'd to Ilium. There she found The son of royal Priam by the throng Of chariots and of steeds compass'd about. She, standing at his side, him thus bespake. Oh, son of Priam! as the Gods discrete! I bring thee counsel from the Sire of all. While yet thou shalt the son of Atreus see Fierce warring in the van, and mowing down The warrior ranks, so long he bids thee pause From battle, leaving to thy host the task Of bloody contest furious with the Greeks. But soon as Atreus' son, by spear or shaft Wounded, shall climb his chariot, Jove will then Endue thee with such force, that thou shalt slay Till thou have reach'd the ships, and till, the sun Descending, sacred darkness cover all. So saying, swift-pinion'd Iris disappear'd. Then Hector from his chariot at a leap Came down all arm'd, and, shaking his bright spears, Ranged every quarter, animating loud The legions, and rekindling horrid war. Back roll'd the Trojan ranks, and faced the Greeks; The Greeks their host to closer phalanx drew; The battle was restored, van fronting van They stood, and Agamemnon into fight Sprang foremost, panting for superior fame. Say now, ye Nine, who on Olympus dwell! What Trojan first, or what ally of Troy Opposed the force of Agamemnon's arm? Iphidamas, Antenor's valiant son, Of loftiest stature, who in fertile Thrace Mother of flocks was nourish'd. Cisseus him His grandsire, father of Theano praised For loveliest features, in his own abode Rear'd yet a child, and when at length he reach'd The measure of his glorious manhood firm Dismiss'd him not, but, to engage him more, Gave him his daughter. Wedded, he his bride As soon deserted, and with galleys twelve Following the rumour'd voyage of the Greeks, The same course steer'd; but at Percope moor'd, And marching thence, arrived on foot at Troy. He first opposed Atrides. They approach'd. The spear of Agamemnon wander'd wide; But him Iphidamas on his broad belt Beneath the corslet struck, and, bearing still On his spear-beam, enforced it; but ere yet He pierced the broider'd zone, his point, impress'd Against the silver, turn'd, obtuse as lead. Then royal Agamemnon in his hand The weapon grasping, with a lion's rage Home drew it to himself, and from his gripe Wresting it, with his faulchion keen his neck Smote full, and stretch'd him lifeless at his foot. So slept Iphidamas among the slain; Unhappy! from his virgin bride remote, Associate with the men of Troy in arms He fell, and left her beauties unenjoy'd. He gave her much, gave her an hundred beeves, And sheep and goats a thousand from his flocks Promised, for numberless his meadows ranged; But Agamemnon, son of Atreus, him Slew and despoil'd, and through the Greecian host Proceeded, laden with his gorgeous arms. Coön that sight beheld, illustrious Chief, Antenor's eldest born, but with dim eyes Through anguish for his brother's fall. Unseen Of noble Agamemnon, at his side He cautious stood, and with a spear his arm, Where thickest flesh'd, below his elbow, pierced, Till opposite the glittering point appear'd. A thrilling horror seized the King of men So wounded; yet though wounded so, from fight He ceased not, but on Coön rush'd, his spear Grasping, well-thriven growth ???????????—literally—wind-nourished. of many a wind. He by the foot drew off Iphidamas, His brother, son of his own sire, aloud Calling the Trojan leaders to his aid, When him so occupied with his keen point Atrides pierced his bossy shield beneath. Expiring on Iphidamas he fell Prostrate, and Agamemnon lopp'd his head. Thus, under royal Agamemnon's hand, Antenor's sons their destiny fulfill'd, And to the house of Ades journey'd both. Through other ranks of warriors then he pass'd, Now with his spear, now with his faulchion arm'd, And now with missile force of massy stones, While yet his warm blood sallied from the wound. But when the wound grew dry, and the blood ceased, Anguish intolerable undermined Then all the might of Atreus' royal son. As when a labouring woman's arrowy throes Seize her intense, by Juno's daughters dread The birth-presiding Ilithyæ deep Infixt, dispensers of those pangs severe; So, anguish insupportable subdued Then all the might of Atreus' royal son. Up-springing to his seat, instant he bade His charioteer drive to the hollow barks, Heart-sick himself with pain; yet, ere he went, With voice loud-echoing hail'd the Danaï. Friends! counsellors and leaders of the Greeks! Now drive, yourselves, the battle from your ships. For me the Gods permit not to employ In fight with Ilium's host the day entire. He ended, and the charioteer his steeds Lash'd to the ships; they not unwilling flew, Bearing from battle the afflicted King With foaming chests and bellies grey with dust. Soon Hector, noting his retreat, aloud Call'd on the Trojans and allies of Troy. Trojans and Lycians, and close-fighting sons Of Dardanus! oh summon all your might; Now, now be men! Their bravest is withdrawn! Glory and honour from Saturnian Jove On me attend; now full against the Greeks Drive all your steeds, and win a deathless name. He spake—and all drew courage from his word. As when his hounds bright-tooth'd some hunter cheers Against the lion or the forest-boar, So Priameïan Hector cheer'd his host Magnanimous against the sons of Greece, Terrible as gore-tainted Mars. Among The foremost warriors, with success elate He strode, and flung himself into the fight Black as a storm which sudden from on high Descending, furrows deep the gloomy flood. Then whom slew Priameïan Hector first, Whom last, by Jove, that day, with glory crown'd? Assæus, Dolops, Orus, Agelaüs, Autonoüs, Hipponoüs, Æsymnus, Opheltius and Opites first he slew, All leaders of the Greeks, and, after these, The people. As when whirlwinds of the West A storm encounter from the gloomy South, The waves roll multitudinous, and the foam Upswept by wandering gusts fills all the air, So Hector swept the Greecians. Then defeat Past remedy and havoc had ensued, Then had the routed Greecians, flying, sought Their ships again, but that Ulysses thus Summon'd the brave Tydides to his aid. Whence comes it, Diomede, that we forget Our wonted courage? Hither, O my friend! And, fighting at my side, ward off the shame That must be ours, should Hector seize the fleet. To whom the valiant Diomede replied. I will be firm; trust me thou shalt not find Me shrinking; yet small fruit of our attempts Shall follow, for the Thunderer, not to us, But to the Trojan, gives the glorious day. The Hero spake, and from his chariot cast Thymbræus to the ground pierced through the pap, While by Ulysses' hand his charioteer Godlike Molion, fell. The warfare thus Of both for ever closed, them there they left, And plunging deep into the warrior-throng Troubled the multitude. As when two boars Turn desperate on the close-pursuing hounds, So they, returning on the host of Troy, Slew on all sides, and overtoil'd with flight From Hector's arm, the Greeks meantime respired. Two warriors, next, their chariot and themselves They took, plebeians brave, sons of the seer Percosian Merops in prophetic skill Surpassing all; he both his sons forbad The mortal field, but disobedient they Still sought it, for their destiny prevail'd. Spear-practised Diomede of life deprived Both these, and stripp'd them of their glorious arms, While by Ulysses' hand Hippodamus Died and Hypeirochus. And now the son Of Saturn, looking down from Ida, poised The doubtful war, and mutual deaths they dealt. Tydides plunged his spear into the groin Of the illustrious son of Pæon, bold Agastrophus. No steeds at his command Had he, infatuate! but his charioteer His steeds detain'd remote, while through the van Himself on foot rush'd madly till he fell. But Hector through the ranks darting his eye Perceived, and with ear-piercing cries advanced Against them, follow'd by the host of Troy. The son of Tydeus, shuddering, his approach Discern'd, and instant to Ulysses spake. Now comes the storm! This way the mischief rolls! Stand and repulse the Trojan. Now be firm. He said, and hurling his long-shadow'd beam Smote Hector. At his helmet's crown he aim'd, Nor err'd, but brass encountering brass, the point Glanced wide, for he had cased his youthful brows In triple brass, Apollo's glorious gift. Yet with rapidity at such a shock Hector recoil'd into the multitude Afar, where sinking to his knees, he lean'd On his broad palm, and darkness veil'd his eyes. But while Tydides follow'd through the van His stormy spear, which in the distant soil Implanted stood, Hector his scatter'd sense Recovering, to his chariot sprang again, And, diving deep into his host, escaped. The noble son of Tydeus, spear in hand, Rush'd after him, and as he went, exclaim'd. Dog! thou hast now escaped; but, sure the stroke Approach'd thee nigh, well-aim'd. Once more thy prayers Which ever to Apollo thou prefer'st Entering the clash of battle, have prevail'd, And he hath rescued thee. But well beware Our next encounter, for if also me Some God befriend, thou diest. Now will I seek Another mark, and smite whom next I may. He spake, and of his armour stripp'd the son Spear-famed of Pæon. Meantime Paris, mate Of beauteous Helen, drew his bow against Tydides; by a pillar of the tomb Of Ilus, ancient senator revered, Conceal'd he stood, and while the Hero loosed His corslet from the breast of Pæon's son Renown'd, and of his helmet and his targe Despoil'd him; Paris, arching quick his bow, No devious shaft dismiss'd, but his right foot Pierced through the sole, and fix'd it to the ground. Transported from his ambush forth he leap'd With a loud laugh, and, vaunting, thus exclaim'd: Oh shaft well shot! it galls thee. Would to heaven That it had pierced thy heart, and thou hadst died! So had the Trojans respite from their toils Enjoy'd, who, now, shudder at sight of thee Like she-goats when the lion is at hand. To whom, undaunted, Diomede replied. Archer shrew-tongued! spie-maiden! man of curls In the original—???? ?????.—All that I pretend to know of this expression is that it is ironical, and may relate either to the head-dress of Paris, or to his archership. To translate it is impossible; to paraphrase it in a passage of so much emotion, would be absurd. I have endeavoured to supply its place by an appellation in point of contempt equal.! Should'st thou in arms attempt me face to face, Thy bow and arrows should avail thee nought. Vain boaster! thou hast scratch'd my foot,—no more— And I regard it as I might the stroke Of a weak woman or a simple child. The weapons of a dastard and a slave Are ever such. More terrible are mine, And whom they pierce, though slightly pierced, he dies. His wife her cheeks rends inconsolable, His babes are fatherless, his blood the glebe Incarnadines, and where he bleeds and rots More birds of prey than women haunt the place. He ended, and Ulysses, drawing nigh, Shelter'd Tydides; he behind the Chief Of Ithaca sat drawing forth the shaft, But pierced with agonizing pangs the while. Then, climbing to his chariot-seat, he bade Sthenelus hasten to the hollow ships, Heart-sick with pain. And now alone was seen Spear-famed Ulysses; not an Argive more Remain'd, so universal was the rout, And groaning, to his own great heart he said. Alas! what now awaits me? if, appall'd By multitudes, I fly, much detriment; And if alone they intercept me here, Still more; for Jove hath scatter'd all the host. Yet why these doubts? for know I not of old That only dastards fly, and that the voice Of honour bids the famed in battle stand, Bleed they themselves, or cause their foes to bleed? While busied in such thought he stood, the ranks Of Trojans fronted with broad shields, enclosed The hero with a ring, hemming around Their own destruction. As when dogs, and swains In prime of manhood, from all quarters rush Around a boar, he from his thicket bolts, The bright tusk whetting in his crooked jaws: They press him on all sides, and from beneath Loud gnashings hear, yet, firm, his threats defy; Like them the Trojans on all sides assail'd Ulysses dear to Jove. First with his spear He sprang impetuous on a valiant chief, Whose shoulder with a downright point he pierced, Deïopites; Thoön next he slew, And Ennomus, and from his coursers' backs Alighting quick, Chersidamas; beneath His bossy shield the gliding weapon pass'd Right through his navel; on the plain he fell Expiring, and with both hands clench'd the dust. Them slain he left, and Charops wounded next, Brother of Socus, generous Chief, and son Of Hippasus; brave Socus to the aid Of Charops flew, and, godlike, thus began. Illustrious chief, Ulysses! strong to toil And rich in artifice! Or boast to-day Two sons of Hippasus, brave warriors both, Of armour and of life bereft by thee, Or to my vengeful spear resign thy own! So saying, Ulysses' oval disk he smote. Through his bright disk the stormy weapon flew, Transpierced his twisted mail, and from his side Drove all the skin, but to his nobler parts Found entrance none, by Pallas turn'd aslant. Ulysses, conscious of his life untouch'd, Retired a step from Socus, and replied. Ah hapless youth; thy fate is on the wing; Me thou hast forced indeed to cease a while From battle with the Trojans, but I speak Thy death at hand; for vanquish'd by my spear, This self-same day thou shalt to me resign Thy fame, thy soul to Pluto steed-renown'd. He ceased; then Socus turn'd his back to fly, But, as he turn'd, his shoulder-blades between He pierced him, and the spear urged through his breast. On his resounding arms he fell, and thus Godlike Ulysses gloried in his fall. Ah, Socus, son of Hippasus, a chief Of fame equestrian! swifter far than thou Death follow'd thee, and thou hast not escaped. Ill-fated youth! thy parents' hands thine eyes Shall never close, but birds of ravenous maw Shall tear thee, flapping thee with frequent wing, While me the noble Greecians shall entomb! So saying, the valiant Socus' spear he drew From his own flesh, and through his bossy shield. The weapon drawn, forth sprang the blood, and left His spirit faint. Then Ilium's dauntless sons, Seeing Ulysses' blood, exhorted glad Each other, and, with force united, all Press'd on him. He, retiring, summon'd loud His followers. Thrice, loud as a mortal may, He call'd, and valiant Menelaus thrice Hearing the voice, to Ajax thus remark'd. Illustrious son of Telamon! The voice Of Laertiades comes o'er my ear With such a sound, as if the hardy chief, Abandon'd of his friends, were overpower'd By numbers intercepting his retreat. Haste! force we quick a passage through the ranks. His worth demands our succour, for I fear Lest sole conflicting with the host of Troy, Brave as he is, he perish, to the loss Unspeakable and long regret of Greece. So saying, he went, and Ajax, godlike Chief, Follow'd him. At the voice arrived, they found Ulysses Jove-beloved compass'd about By Trojans, as the lynxes in the hills, Adust for blood, compass an antler'd stag Pierced by an archer; while his blood is warm And his limbs pliable, from him he 'scapes; But when the feather'd barb hath quell'd his force, In some dark hollow of the mountain's side, The hungry troop devour him; chance, the while, Conducts a lion thither, before whom All vanish, and the lion feeds alone; So swarm'd the Trojan powers, numerous and bold, Around Ulysses, who with wary skill Heroic combated his evil day. But Ajax came cover'd with his broad shield That seem'd a tower, and at Ulysses' side Stood fast; then fled the Trojans wide-dispersed, And Menelaus led him by the hand Till his own chariot to his aid approach'd. But Ajax, springing on the Trojans, slew Doryclus, from the loins of Priam sprung, But spurious. Pandocus he wounded next, Then wounded Pyrasus, and after him Pylartes and Lysander. As a flood Runs headlong from the mountains to the plain After long showers from Jove; many a dry oak And many a pine the torrent sweeps along, And, turbid, shoots much soil into the sea, So, glorious Ajax troubled wide the field, Horse and man slaughtering, whereof Hector yet Heard not; for on the left of all the war He fought beside Scamander, where around Huge Nestor, and Idomeneus the brave, Most deaths were dealt, and loudest roar'd the fight. There Hector toil'd, feats wonderful of spear And horsemanship atchieving, and the lines Of many a phalanx desolating wide. Nor even then had the bold Greeks retired, But that an arrow triple-barb'd, dispatch'd By Paris, Helen's mate, against the Chief Machaon warring with distinguish'd force, Pierced his right shoulder. For his sake alarm'd, The valour-breathing Greecians fear'd, lest he In that disasterous field should also fall. At once, Idomeneus of Crete approach'd The noble Nestor, and him thus bespake. Arise, Neleian Nestor! Pride of Greece! Ascend thy chariot, and Machaon placed Beside thee, bear him, instant, to the fleet. For one, so skill'd in medicine, and to free The inherent barb, is worth a multitude. He said, nor the Gerenian hero old Aught hesitated, but into his seat Ascended, and Machaon, son renown'd Of Æsculapius, mounted at his side. He lash'd the steeds, they not unwilling sought The hollow ships, long their familiar home. Cebriones, meantime, the charioteer Of Hector, from his seat the Trojan ranks Observing sore discomfited, began. Here are we busied, Hector! on the skirts Of roaring battle, and meantime I see Our host confused, their horses and themselves All mingled. Telamonian Ajax there Routs them; I know the hero by his shield. Haste, drive we thither, for the carnage most Of horse and foot conflicting furious, there Rages, and infinite the shouts arise. He said, and with shrill-sounding scourge the steeds Smote ample-maned; they, at the sudden stroke Through both hosts whirl'd the chariot, shields and men Trampling; with blood the axle underneath All redden'd, and the chariot-rings with drops From the horse-hoofs, and from the fellied wheels. Full on the multitude he drove, on fire To burst the phalanx, and confusion sent Among the Greeks, for nought This interpretation of—??????? ?? ?????? ??????—is taken from the Scholium by Villoisson. It differs from those of Clarke, Eustathius, and another Scholiast quoted by Clarke, but seems to suit the context much better than either. he shunn'd the spear. All quarters else with faulchion or with lance, Or with huge stones he ranged, but cautious shunn'd The encounter of the Telamonian Chief. But the eternal father throned on high With fear fill'd Ajax; panic-fixt he stood, His seven-fold shield behind his shoulder cast, And hemm'd by numbers, with an eye askant, Watchful retreated. As a beast of prey Retiring, turns and looks, so he his face Turn'd oft, retiring slow, and step by step. As when the watch-dogs and assembled swains Have driven a tawny lion from the stalls, Then, interdicting him his wish'd repast, Watch all the night, he, famish'd, yet again Comes furious on, but speeds not, kept aloof By frequent spears from daring hands, but more By flash of torches, which, though fierce, he dreads, Till, at the dawn, sullen he stalks away; So from before the Trojans Ajax stalk'd Sullen, and with reluctance slow retired, His brave heart trembling for the fleet of Greece. As when (the boys o'erpower'd) a sluggish ass, On whose tough sides they have spent many a staff, Enters the harvest, and the spiry ears Crops persevering; with their rods the boys Still ply him hard, but all their puny might Scarce drives him forth when he hath browzed his fill, So, there, the Trojans and their foreign aids With glittering lances keen huge Ajax urged, His broad shield's centre smiting. He, by turns, With desperate force the Trojan phalanx dense Facing, repulsed them, and by turns he fled, But still forbad all inroad on the fleet. Trojans and Greeks between, alone, he stood A bulwark. Spears from daring hands dismiss'd Some, piercing his broad shield, there planted stood, While others, in the midway falling, spent Their disappointed rage deep in the ground. Eurypylus, Evæmon's noble son, Him seeing, thus, with weapons overwhelm'd Flew to his side, his glittering lance dismiss'd, And Apisaon, son of Phausias, struck Under the midriff; through his liver pass'd The ruthless point, and, falling, he expired. Forth sprang Eurypylus to seize the spoil; Whom soon as godlike Alexander saw Despoiling Apisaon of his arms, Drawing incontinent his bow, he sent A shaft to his right thigh; the brittle reed Snapp'd, and the rankling barb stuck fast within. Terrified at the stroke, the wounded Chief To his own band retired, but, as he went, With echoing voice call'd on the Danaï— Friends! Counsellors, and leaders of the Greeks! Turn ye and stand, and from his dreadful lot Save Ajax whelm'd with weapons; 'scape, I judge, He cannot from the roaring fight, yet oh Stand fast around him; save, if save ye may, Your champion huge, the Telamonian Chief! So spake the wounded warrior. They at once With sloping bucklers, and with spears erect, To his relief approach'd. Ajax with joy The friendly phalanx join'd, then turn'd and stood. Thus burn'd the embattled field as with the flames Of a devouring fire. Meantime afar From all that tumult the Neleian mares Bore Nestor, foaming as they ran, with whom Machaon also rode, leader revered. Achilles mark'd him passing; for he stood Exalted on his huge ship's lofty stern, Spectator of the toil severe, and flight Deplorable of the defeated Greeks. He call'd his friend Patroclus. He below Within his tent the sudden summons heard And sprang like Mars abroad, all unaware That in that sound he heard the voice of fate. Him first Menœtius' gallant son address'd. What would Achilles? Wherefore hath he call'd? To whom Achilles swiftest of the swift: Brave Menœtiades! my soul's delight! Soon will the Greecians now my knees surround Suppliant, by dread extremity constrain'd. But fly Patroclus, haste, oh dear to Jove! Enquire of Nestor, whom he hath convey'd From battle, wounded? Viewing him behind, I most believed him Æsculapius' son Machaon, but the steeds so swiftly pass'd My galley, that his face escaped my note. He said, and prompt to gratify his friend, Forth ran Patroclus through the camp of Greece. Now when Neleian Nestor to his tent Had brought Machaon, they alighted both, And the old hero's friend Eurymedon Released the coursers. On the beach awhile Their tunics sweat-imbued in the cool air They ventilated, facing full the breeze, Then on soft couches in the tent reposed. Meantime, their beverage Hecamede mix'd, The old King's bright-hair'd captive, whom he brought From Tenedos, what time Achilles sack'd The city, daughter of the noble Chief Arsinoüs, and selected from the rest For Nestor, as the honourable meed Of counsels always eminently wise. She, first, before them placed a table bright, With feet cœrulean; thirst-provoking sauce She brought them also in a brazen tray, Garlick and honey new, and sacred meal. Beside them, next, she placed a noble cup Of labour exquisite, which from his home The ancient King had brought with golden studs Embellish'd; it presented to the grasp Four ears; two golden turtles, perch'd on each, Seem'd feeding, and two turtles I have interpreted the very ambiguous words ??? ?? ??? ???????? ???? according to Athenæus as quoted by Clarke, and his interpretation of them is confirmed by the Scholium in the Venetian edition of the Iliad, lately published by Villoisson. form'd the base. That cup once fill'd, all others must have toil'd To move it from the board, but it was light In Nestor's hand; he lifted it with ease. The graceful virgin in that cup a draught Mix'd for them, Pramnian wine and savoury cheese Of goat's milk, grated with a brazen rasp, Then sprinkled all with meal. The draught prepared, She gave it to their hand; they, drinking, slaked Their fiery thirst, and with each other sat Conversing friendly, when the Godlike youth By brave Achilles sent, stood at the door. Him seeing, Nestor from his splendid couch Arose, and by the hand leading him in, Entreated him to sit, but that request Patroclus, on his part refusing, said, Oh venerable King! no seat is here For me, nor may thy courtesy prevail. He is irascible, and to be fear'd Who bade me ask what Chieftain thou hast brought From battle, wounded; but untold I learn; I see Machaon, and shall now report As I have seen; oh ancient King revered! Thou know'st Achilles fiery, and propense Blame to impute even where blame is none. To whom the brave Gerenian thus reply'd. Why feels Achilles for the wounded Greeks Such deep concern? He little knows the height To which our sorrows swell. Our noblest lie By spear or arrow wounded in the fleet. Diomede, warlike son of Tydeus, bleeds, Gall'd by a shaft; Ulysses, glorious Chief, And Agamemnon It would have suited the dignity of Agamemnon's rank to have mentioned his wound first; but Nestor making this recital to the friend of Achilles names him slightly, and without any addition. suffer by the spear; Eurypylus is shot into the thigh, And here lies still another newly brought By me from fight, pierced also by a shaft. What then? How strong soe'er to give them aid Achilles feels no pity of the Greeks. Waits he till every vessel on the shore Fired, in despite of the whole Argive host, Be sunk in its own ashes, and ourselves All perish, heaps on heaps? For in my limbs No longer lives the agility of my youth. Oh, for the vigour of those days again, When Elis, for her cattle which we took, Strove with us, and Itymoneus I slew, Brave offspring of Hypirochus; he dwelt In Elis, and while I the pledges drove, Stood for his herd, but fell among the first By a spear hurl'd from my victorious arm. Then fled the rustic multitude, and we Drove off abundant booty from the plain, Herds fifty of fat beeves, large flocks of goats As many, with as many sheep and swine, And full thrice fifty mares of brightest hue, All breeders, many with their foals beneath. All these, by night returning safe, we drove Into Neleian Pylus, and the heart Rejoiced of Neleus, in a son so young A warrior, yet enrich'd with such a prize. At early dawn the heralds summon'd loud The citizens, to prove their just demands On fruitful Elis, and the assembled Chiefs Division made, (for numerous were the debts Which the Epeans, in the weak estate Of the unpeopled Pylus, had incurr'd; For Hercules, few years before, had sack'd It is said that the Thebans having war with the people of Orchomenos, the Pylians assisted the latter, for which cause Hercules destroyed their city. —See Scholium per Villoisson. Our city, and our mightiest slain. Ourselves The gallant sons of Neleus, were in all Twelve youths, of whom myself alone survived; The rest all perish'd; whence, presumptuous grown, The brazen-mail'd Epeans wrong'd us oft.) An herd of beeves my father for himself Selected, and a numerous flock beside, Three hundred sheep, with shepherds for them all. For he a claimant was of large arrears From sacred Elis. Four unrivall'd steeds With his own chariot to the games he sent, That should contend for the appointed prize A tripod; but Augeias, King of men, Detain'd the steeds, and sent the charioteer Defrauded home. My father, therefore, fired At such foul outrage both of deeds and words, Took much, and to the Pylians gave the rest For satisfaction of the claims of all. While thus we busied were in these concerns, And in performance of religious rites Throughout the city, came the Epeans arm'd, Their whole vast multitude both horse and foot On the third day; came also clad in brass The two Molions, inexpert as yet In feats of arms, and of a boyish age. There is a city on a mountain's head, Fast by the banks of Alpheus, far remote, The utmost town which sandy Pylus owns, Named Thryoëssa, and, with ardour fired To lay it waste, that city they besieged. Now when their host had traversed all the plain, Minerva from Olympus flew by night And bade us arm; nor were the Pylians slow To assemble, but impatient for the fight. Me, then, my father suffer'd not to arm, But hid my steeds, for he supposed me raw As yet, and ignorant how war is waged. Yet, even thus, unvantaged and on foot, Superior honours I that day acquired To theirs who rode, for Pallas led me on Herself to victory. There is a stream Which at Arena falls into the sea, Named Minuëius; on that river's bank The Pylian horsemen waited day's approach, And thither all our foot came pouring down. The flood divine of Alpheus thence we reach'd At noon, all arm'd complete; there, hallow'd rites We held to Jove omnipotent, and slew A bull to sacred Alpheus, with a bull To Neptune, and an heifer of the herd To Pallas; then, all marshall'd as they were, From van to rear our legions took repast, And at the river's side slept on their arms. Already the Epean host had round Begirt the city, bent to lay it waste, A task which cost them, first, both blood and toil. For when the radiant sun on the green earth Had risen, with prayer to Pallas and to Jove, We gave them battle. When the Pylian host And the Epeans thus were close engaged, I first a warrior slew, Mulius the brave, And seized his coursers. He the eldest-born Of King Augeias' daughters had espoused The golden Agamede; not an herb The spacious earth yields but she knew its powers. Him, rushing on me, with my brazen lance I smote, and in the dust he fell; I leap'd Into his seat, and drove into the van. A panic seized the Epeans when they saw The leader of their horse o'erthrown, a Chief Surpassing all in fight. Black as a cloud With whirlwind fraught, I drove impetuous on, Took fifty chariots, and at side of each Lay two slain warriors, with their teeth the soil Grinding, all vanquish'd by my single arm. I had slain also the Molions, sons Of Actor, but the Sovereign of the deep Their own authentic Sire, in darkness dense Involving both, convey'd them safe away. Then Jove a victory of prime renown Gave to the Pylians; for we chased and slew And gather'd spoil o'er all the champain spread With scatter'd shields, till we our steeds had driven To the Buprasian fields laden with corn, To the Olenian rock, and to a town In fair Colona situate, and named Alesia. There it was that Pallas turn'd Our people homeward; there I left the last Of all the slain, and he was slain by me. Then drove the Achaians from Buprasium home Their coursers fleet, and Jove, of Gods above, Received most praise, Nestor of men below. Such once was I. But brave Achilles shuts His virtues close, an unimparted store; Yet even he shall weep, when all the host, His fellow-warriors once, shall be destroy'd. But recollect, young friend! the sage advice Which when thou camest from Phthia to the aid Of Agamemnon, on that selfsame day Menœtius gave thee. We were present there, Ulysses and myself, both in the house, And heard it all; for to the house we came Of Peleus in our journey through the land Of fertile Greece, gathering her states to war. We found thy noble sire Menœtius there, Thee and Achilles; ancient Peleus stood To Jove the Thunderer offering in his court Thighs of an ox, and on the blazing rites Libation pouring from a cup of gold. While ye on preparation of the feast Attended both, Ulysses and myself Stood in the vestibule; Achilles flew Toward us, introduced us by the hand, And, seating us, such liberal portion gave To each, as hospitality requires. Our thirst, at length, and hunger both sufficed, I, foremost speaking, ask'd you to the wars, And ye were eager both, but from your sires Much admonition, ere ye went, received. Old Peleus charged Achilles to aspire To highest praise, and always to excel. But thee, thy sire Menœtius thus advised. “My son! Achilles boasts the nobler birth, But Thou art elder; He in strength excels Thee far; Thou, therefore, with discretion rule His inexperience; thy advice impart With gentleness; instruction wise suggest Wisely, and thou shalt find him apt to learn.” So thee thy father taught, but, as it seems, In vain. Yet even now essay to move Warlike Achilles; if the Gods so please, Who knows but that thy reasons may prevail To rouse his valiant heart? men rarely scorn The earnest intercession of a friend. But if some prophecy alarm his fears, And from his Goddess mother he have aught Received, who may have learnt the same from Jove, Thee let him send at least, and order forth With thee the Myrmidons; a dawn of hope Shall thence, it may be, on our host arise. And let him send thee to the battle clad In his own radiant armour; Troy, deceived By such resemblance, shall abstain perchance From conflict, and the weary Greeks enjoy Short respite; it is all that war allows. Fresh as ye are, ye, by your shouts alone, May easily repulse an army spent With labour from the camp and from the fleet. Thus Nestor, and his mind bent to his words. Back to Æacides through all the camp He ran; and when, still running, he arrived Among Ulysses' barks, where they had fix'd The forum, where they minister'd the laws, And had erected altars to the Gods, There him Eurypylus, Evæmon's son, Illustrious met, deep-wounded in his thigh, And halting back from battle. From his head The sweat, and from his shoulders ran profuse, And from his perilous wound the sable blood Continual stream'd; yet was his mind composed. Him seeing, Menœtiades the brave Compassion felt, and, mournful, thus began. Ah hapless senators and Chiefs of Greece! Left ye your native country that the dogs Might fatten on your flesh at distant Troy? But tell me, Hero! say, Eurypylus! Have the Achaians power still to withstand The enormous force of Hector, or is this The moment when his spear must pierce us all? To whom Eurypylus, discrete, replied. Patroclus, dear to Jove! there is no help, No remedy. We perish at our ships. The warriors, once most strenuous of the Greeks. Lie wounded in the fleet by foes whose might Increases ever. But thyself afford To me some succour; lead me to my ship; Cut forth the arrow from my thigh; the gore With warm ablution cleanse, and on the wound Smooth unguents spread, the same as by report Achilles taught thee; taught, himself, their use By Chiron, Centaur, justest of his kind. For Podalirius and Machaon both Are occupied. Machaon, as I judge, Lies wounded in his tent, needing like aid Himself, and Podalirius in the field Maintains sharp conflict with the sons of Troy. To whom Menœtius' gallant son replied. Hero! Eurypylus! how shall we act In this perplexity? what course pursue? I seek the brave Achilles, to whose ear I bear a message from the ancient Chief Gerenian Nestor, guardian of the Greeks. Yet will I not, even for such a cause, My friend! abandon thee in thy distress. He ended, and his arms folding around The warrior bore him thence into his tent. His servant, on his entrance, spread the floor With hides, on which Patroclus at his length Extended him, and with his knife cut forth The rankling point; with tepid lotion, next, He cleansed the gore, and with a bitter root Bruised small between his palms, sprinkled the wound. At once, the anodyne his pains assuaged, The wound was dried within, and the blood ceased. BOOK XII. ARGUMENT OF THE TWELFTH BOOK. The Trojans assail the ramparts, and Hector forces the gates. So was Menœtius' valiant son employ'd Healing Eurypylus. The Greeks, meantime, And Trojans with tumultuous fury fought. Nor was the foss ordain'd long time to exclude The host of Troy, nor yet the rampart built Beside it for protection of the fleet; For hecatomb the Greeks had offer'd none, Nor prayer to heaven, that it might keep secure Their ships with all their spoils. The mighty work As in defiance of the Immortal Powers Had risen, and could not therefore long endure. While Hector lived, and while Achilles held His wrathful purpose; while the city yet Of royal Priam was unsack'd, so long The massy structure stood; but when the best And bravest of the Trojan host were slain, And of the Greecian heroes, some had fallen And some survived, when Priam's towers had blazed In the tenth year, and to their native shores The Greecians with their ships, at length, return'd, Then Neptune, with Apollo leagued, devised Its ruin; every river that descends From the Idæan heights into the sea They brought against it, gathering all their force, Rhesus, Caresus, Rhodius, the wide-branch'd Heptaporus, Æsepus, Granicus, Scamander's sacred current, and thy stream Simöis, whose banks with helmets and with shields Were strew'd, and Chiefs of origin divine; All these with refluent course Apollo drove Nine days against the rampart, and Jove rain'd Incessant, that the Greecian wall wave-whelm'd Through all its length might sudden disappear. Neptune with his tridental mace, himself, Led them, and beam and buttress to the flood Consigning, laid by the laborious Greeks, Swept the foundation, and the level bank Of the swift-rolling Hellespont restored. The structure thus effaced, the spacious beach He spread with sand as at the first; then bade Subside the streams, and in their channels wind With limpid course, and pleasant as before. Apollo thus and Neptune, from the first, Design'd its fall; but now the battle raved And clamours of the warriors all around The strong-built turrets, whose assaulted planks Rang, while the Greecians, by the scourge of Jove Subdued, stood close within their fleet immured, At Hector's phalanx-scattering force appall'd. He, as before, with whirlwind fury fought. As when the boar or lion fiery-eyed Turns short, the hunters and the hounds among, The close-imbattled troop him firm oppose, And ply him fast with spears; he no dismay Conceives or terror in his noble heart, But by his courage falls; frequent he turns Attempting bold the ranks, and where he points Direct his onset, there the ranks retire; So, through the concourse on his rolling wheels Borne rapid, Hector animated loud His fellow-warriors to surpass the trench. But not his own swift-footed steeds would dare That hazard; standing on the dangerous brink They neigh'd aloud, for by its breadth the foss Deterr'd them; neither was the effort slight To leap that gulf, nor easy the attempt To pass it through; steep were the banks profound On both sides, and with massy piles acute Thick-planted, interdicting all assault. No courser to the rapid chariot braced Had enter'd there with ease; yet strong desires Possess'd the infantry of that emprize, And thus Polydamas the ear address'd Of dauntless Hector, standing at his side. Hector, and ye the leaders of our host, Both Trojans and allies! rash the attempt I deem, and vain, to push our horses through, So dangerous is the pass; rough is the trench With pointed stakes, and the Achaian wall Meets us beyond. No chariot may descend Or charioteer fight there; strait are the bounds, And incommodious, and his death were sure. If Jove, high-thundering Ruler of the skies, Will succour Ilium, and nought less intend Than utter devastation of the Greeks, I am content; now perish all their host Inglorious, from their country far remote. But should they turn, and should ourselves be driven Back from the fleet impeded and perplex'd In this deep foss, I judge that not a man, 'Scaping the rallied Greecians, should survive, To bear the tidings of our fate to Troy. Now, therefore, act we all as I advise. Let every charioteer his coursers hold Fast-rein'd beside the foss, while we on foot, With order undisturb'd and arms in hand, Shall follow Hector. If destruction borne On wings of destiny this day approach The Greecians, they will fly our first assault. So spake Polydamas, whose safe advice Pleased Hector; from his chariot to the ground All arm'd he leap'd, nor would a Trojan there (When once they saw the Hero on his feet) Ride into battle, but, unanimous Descending with a leap, all trod the plain. Each gave command that at the trench his steeds Should stand detain'd in orderly array; Then, suddenly, the parted host became Five bands, each following its appointed chief. The bravest and most numerous, and whose hearts Wish'd most to burst the barrier and to wage The battle at the ships, with Hector march'd And with Polydamas, whom follow'd, third, Cebriones; for Hector had his steeds Consign'd and chariot to inferior care. Paris, Alcathoüs, and Agenor led The second band, and, sons of Priam both, Deïphobus and Helenus, the third; With them was seen partner of their command, The Hero Asius; from Arisba came Asius Hyrtacides, to battle drawn From the Selleïs banks by martial steeds Hair'd fiery-red and of the noblest size. The fourth, Anchises' mighty son controul'd, Æneas; under him Antenor's sons, Archilochus and Acamas, advanced, Adept in all the practice of the field. Last came the glorious powers in league with Troy Led by Sarpedon; he with Glaucus shared His high controul, and with the warlike Chief Asteropæus; for of all his host Them bravest he esteem'd, himself except Superior in heroic might to all. And now, (their shields adjusted each to each) With dauntless courage fired, right on they moved Against the Greecians; nor expected less Than that beside their sable ships, the host Should self-abandon'd fall an easy prey. The Trojans, thus, with their confederate powers, The counsel of the accomplish'd Prince pursued, Polydamas, one Chief alone except, Asius Hyrtacides. He scorn'd to leave His charioteer and coursers at the trench, And drove toward the fleet. Ah, madly brave! His evil hour was come; he was ordain'd With horse and chariot and triumphant shout To enter wind-swept Ilium never more. Deucalion's offspring, first, into the shades Dismiss'd him; by Idomeneus he died. Leftward he drove furious, along the road By which the steeds and chariots of the Greeks Return'd from battle; in that track he flew, Nor found the portals by the massy bar Secured, but open for reception safe Of fugitives, and to a guard consign'd. Thither he drove direct, and in his rear His band shrill-shouting follow'd, for they judged The Greeks no longer able to withstand Their foes, but sure to perish in the camp. Vain hope! for in the gate two Chiefs they found Lapithæ-born, courageous offspring each Of dauntless father; Polypœtes, this, Sprung from Pirithöus; that, the warrior bold Leonteus, terrible as gore-tainted Mars. These two, defenders of the lofty gates, Stood firm before them. As when two tall oaks On the high mountains day by day endure Rough wind and rain, by deep-descending roots Of hugest growth fast-founded in the soil; So they, sustain'd by conscious valour, saw, Unmoved, high towering Asius on his way, Nor fear'd him aught, nor shrank from his approach. Right on toward the barrier, lifting high Their season'd bucklers and with clamour loud The band advanced, King Asius at their head, With whom Iämenus, expert in arms, Orestes, Thöon, Acamas the son Of Asius, and Oenamäus, led them on. Till now, the warlike pair, exhorting loud The Greecians to defend the fleet, had stood Within the gates; but soon as they perceived The Trojans swift advancing to the wall, And heard a cry from all the flying Greeks, Both sallying, before the gates they fought Like forest-boars, which hearing in the hills The crash of hounds and huntsmen nigh at hand, With start oblique lay many a saplin flat Short-broken by the root, nor cease to grind Their sounding tusks, till by the spear they die; So sounded on the breasts of those brave Two The smitten brass; for resolute they fought, Embolden'd by their might who kept the wall, And trusting in their own; they, in defence Of camp and fleet and life, thick battery hurl'd Of stones precipitated from the towers; Frequent as snows they fell, which stormy winds, Driving the gloomy clouds, shake to the ground, Till all the fertile earth lies cover'd deep. Such volley pour'd the Greeks, and such return'd The Trojans; casques of hide, arid and tough, And bossy shields rattled, by such a storm Assail'd of millstone masses from above. Then Asius, son of Hyrtacus, a groan Indignant utter'd; on both thighs he smote With disappointment furious, and exclaim'd, Jupiter! even thou art false become, And altogether such. Full sure I deem'd That not a Greecian Hero should abide One moment force invincible as ours, And lo! as wasps ring-straked The word is of scripture use: see Gen. ch. xxx. where it describes the cattle of Jacob., or bees that build Their dwellings in the highway's craggy side Leave not their hollow home, but fearless wait The hunter's coming, in their brood's defence, So these, although two only, from the gates Move not, or will, till either seized or slain. So Asius spake, but speaking so, changed not The mind of Jove on Hector's glory bent. Others, as obstinate, at other gates Such deeds perform'd, that to enumerate all Were difficult, unless to power divine. For fierce the hail of stones from end to end Smote on the barrier; anguish fill'd the Greeks, Yet, by necessity constrain'd, their ships They guarded still; nor less the Gods themselves, Patrons of Greece, all sorrow'd at the sight. At once the valiant Lapithæ began Terrible conflict, and Pirithous' son Brave Polypætes through his helmet pierced Damasus; his resplendent point the brass Sufficed not to withstand; entering, it crush'd The bone within, and mingling all his brain With his own blood, his onset fierce repress'd. Pylon and Ormenus he next subdued. Meantime Leonteus, branch of Mars, his spear Hurl'd at Hippomachus, whom through his belt He pierced; then drawing forth his faulchion keen, Through all the multitude he flew to smite Antiphates, and with a downright stroke Fell'd him. Iämenus and Menon next He slew, with brave Orestes, whom he heap'd, All three together, on the fertile glebe. While them the Lapithæ of their bright arms Despoil'd, Polydamas and Hector stood (With all the bravest youths and most resolved To burst the barrier and to fire the fleet) Beside the foss, pondering the event. For, while they press'd to pass, they spied a bird Sublime in air, an eagle. Right between Both hosts he soar'd (the Trojan on his left) A serpent bearing in his pounces clutch'd Enormous, dripping blood, but lively still And mindful of revenge; for from beneath The eagle's breast, updarting fierce his head, Fast by the throat he struck him; anguish-sick The eagle cast him down into the space Between the hosts, and, clanging loud his plumes, As the wind bore him, floated far away. Shudder'd the Trojans viewing at their feet The spotted serpent ominous, and thus Polydamas to dauntless Hector spake. Ofttimes in council, Hector, thou art wont To censure me, although advising well; Nor ought the private citizen, I confess, Either in council or in war to indulge Loquacity, but ever to employ All his exertions in support of thine. Yet hear my best opinion once again. Proceed we not in our attempt against The Greecian fleet. For if in truth the sign Respect the host of Troy ardent to pass, Then, as the eagle soar'd both hosts between, With Ilium's on his left, and clutch'd a snake Enormous, dripping blood, but still alive, Which yet he dropp'd suddenly, ere he reach'd His eyry, or could give it to his young, So we, although with mighty force we burst Both gates and barrier, and although the Greeks Should all retire, shall never yet the way Tread honourably back by which we came. No. Many a Trojan shall we leave behind Slain by the Greecians in their fleet's defence. An augur skill'd in omens would expound This omen thus, and faith would win from all. To whom, dark-louring, Hector thus replied. Polydamas! I like not thy advice; Thou couldst have framed far better; but if this Be thy deliberate judgement, then the Gods Make thy deliberate judgement nothing worth, Who bidd'st me disregard the Thunderer's firm Assurance to myself announced Alluding to the message delivered to him from Jupiter by Iris., and make The wild inhabitants of air my guides, Which I alike despise, speed they their course With right-hand flight toward the ruddy East, Or leftward down into the shades of eve. Consider we the will of Jove alone, Sovereign of heaven and earth. Omens abound, But the best omen is our country's cause. Wherefore should fiery war thy soul alarm? For were we slaughter'd, one and all, around The fleet of Greece, thou need'st not fear to die, Whose courage never will thy flight retard. But if thou shrink thyself, or by smooth speech Seduce one other from a soldier's part, Pierced by this spear incontinent thou diest. So saying he led them, who with deafening roar Follow'd him. Then, from the Idæan hills Jove hurl'd a storm which wafted right the dust Into the fleet; the spirits too he quell'd Of the Achaians, and the glory gave To Hector and his host; they, trusting firm In signs from Jove, and in their proper force, Assay'd the barrier; from the towers they tore The galleries, cast the battlements to ground, And the projecting buttresses adjoin'd To strengthen the vast work, with bars upheaved. All these, with expectation fierce to break The rampart, down they drew; nor yet the Greeks Gave back, but, fencing close with shields the wall, Smote from behind them many a foe beneath. Meantime from tower to tower the Ajaces moved Exhorting all, with mildness some, and some With harsh rebuke, whom they observed through fear Declining base the labours of the fight. Friends! Argives! warriors of whatever rank! Ye who excel, and ye of humbler note! And ye the last and least! (for such there are, All have not magnanimity alike,) Now have we work for all, as all perceive. Turn not, retreat not to your ships, appall'd By sounding menaces, but press the foe; Exhort each other, and e'en now perchance Olympian Jove, by whom the lightnings burn, Shall grant us to repulse them, and to chase The routed Trojans to their gates again. So they vociferating to the Greeks, Stirr'd them to battle. As the feathery snows Fall frequent, on some wintry day, when Jove Hath risen to shed them on the race of man, And show his arrowy stores; he lulls the winds, Then shakes them down continual, covering thick Mountain tops, promontories, flowery meads, And cultured valleys rich; the ports and shores Receive it also of the hoary Deep, But there the waves bound it, while all beside Lies whelm'd beneath Jove's fast-descending shower, So thick, from side to side, by Trojans hurl'd Against the Greeks, and by the Greeks return'd The stony vollies flew; resounding loud Through all its length the battered rampart roar'd. Nor yet had Hector and his host prevail'd To burst the gates, and break the massy bar Had not all-seeing Jove Sarpedon moved His son, against the Greeks, furious as falls The lion on some horned herd of beeves. At once his polish'd buckler he advanced With leafy brass o'erlaid; for with smooth brass The forger of that shield its oval disk Had plated, and with thickest hides throughout Had lined it, stitch'd with circling wires of gold. That shield he bore before him; firmly grasp'd He shook two spears, and with determined strides March'd forward. As the lion mountain-bred, After long fast, by impulse of his heart Undaunted urged, seeks resolute the flock Even in the shelter of their guarded home; He finds, perchance, the shepherds arm'd with spears, And all their dogs awake, yet cannot leave Untried the fence, but either leaps it light, And entering tears the prey, or in the attempt Pierced by some dexterous peasant, bleeds himself; So high his courage to the assault impell'd Godlike Sarpedon, and him fired with hope To break the barrier; when to Glaucus thus, Son of Hippolochus, his speech he turn'd. Why, Glaucus, is the seat of honour ours, Why drink we brimming cups, and feast in state? Why gaze they all on us as we were Gods In Lycia, and why share we pleasant fields And spacious vineyards, where the Xanthus winds? Distinguish'd thus in Lycia, we are call'd To firmness here, and to encounter bold The burning battle, that our fair report Among the Lycians may be blazon'd thus— No dastards are the potentates who rule The bright-arm'd Lycians; on the fatted flock They banquet, and they drink the richest wines, But they are also valiant, and the fight Wage dauntless in the vaward of us all. Oh Glaucus, if escaping safe the death That threats us here, we also could escape Old age, and to ourselves secure a life Immortal, I would neither in the van Myself expose, nor would encourage thee To tempt the perils of the glorious field. But since a thousand messengers of fate Pursue us close, and man is born to die— E'en let us on; the prize of glory yield, If yield we must, or wrest it from the foe. He said, nor cold refusal in return Received from Glaucus, but toward the wall Their numerous Lycian host both led direct. Menestheus, son of Peteos, saw appall'd Their dread approach, for to his tower they bent Their threatening march. An eager look he cast On the embodied Greeks, seeking some Chief Whose aid might turn the battle from his van: He saw, where never sated with exploits Of war, each Ajax fought, near whom his eye Kenn'd Teucer also, newly from his tent; But vain his efforts were with loudest call To reach their ears, such was the deafening din Upsent to Heaven, of shields and crested helms, And of the batter'd gates; for at each gate They thundering stood, and urged alike at each Their fierce attempt by force to burst the bars. To Ajax therefore he at once dispatch'd An herald, and Thöotes thus enjoin'd. My noble friend, Thöotes! with all speed Call either Ajax; bid them hither both; Far better so; for havoc is at hand. The Lycian leaders, ever in assault Tempestuous, bend their force against this tower My station. But if also there they find Laborious conflict pressing them severe, At least let Telamonian Ajax come, And Teucer with his death-dispensing bow. He spake, nor was Thöotes slow to hear; Beside the rampart of the mail-clad Greeks Rapid he flew, and, at their side arrived, To either Ajax, eager, thus began. Ye leaders of the well-appointed Greeks, The son of noble Peteos calls; he begs With instant suit, that ye would share his toils, However short your stay; the aid of both Will serve him best, for havoc threatens there. The Lycian leaders, ever in assault Tempestuous, bend their force toward the tower His station. But if also here ye find Laborious conflict pressing you severe, At least let Telamonian Ajax come, And Teucer with his death-dispensing bow. He spake, nor his request the towering son Of Telamon denied, but quick his speech To Ajax Oïliades address'd. Ajax! abiding here, exhort ye both (Heroic Lycomedes and thyself) The Greeks to battle. Thither I depart To aid our friends, which service once perform'd Duly, I will incontinent return. So saying, the Telamonian Chief withdrew, With whom went Teucer, son of the same sire, Pandion also, bearing Teucer's bow. Arriving at the turret given in charge To the bold Chief Menestheus, and the wall Entering, they found their friends all sharply tried. Black as a storm the senators renown'd And leaders of the Lycian host assail'd Buttress and tower, while opposite the Greeks Withstood them, and the battle-shout began. First, Ajax, son of Telamon, a friend And fellow-warrior of Sarpedon slew, Epicles. With a marble fragment huge That crown'd the battlement's interior side, He smote him. No man of our puny race, Although in prime of youth, had with both hands That weight sustain'd; but he the cumberous mass Uplifted high, and hurl'd it on his head. It burst his helmet, and his batter'd skull Dash'd from all form. He from the lofty tower Dropp'd downright, with a diver's plunge, and died. But Teucer wounded Glaucus with a shaft, Son of Hippolochus; he, climbing, bared His arm, which Teucer, marking, from the wall Transfix'd it, and his onset fierce repress'd; For with a backward leap Glaucus withdrew Sudden and silent, cautious lest the Greeks Seeing him wounded should insult his pain. Grief seized, at sight of his retiring friend, Sarpedon, who forgat not yet the fight, But piercing with his lance Alcmaon, son Of Thestor, suddenly revulsed the beam, Which following, Alcmaon to the earth Fell prone, with clangor of his brazen arms. Sarpedon, then, strenuous with both hands Tugg'd, and down fell the battlement entire; The wall, dismantled at the summit, stood A ruin, and wide chasm was open'd through. Then Ajax him and Teucer at one time Struck both; an arrow struck from Teucer's bow The belt that cross'd his bosom, by which hung His ample shield; yet lest his son should fall Among the ships, Jove turn'd the death aside. But Ajax, springing to his thrust, a spear Drove through his shield. Sarpedon at the shock With backward step short interval recoil'd, But not retired, for in his bosom lived The hope of glory still, and, looking back On all his godlike Lycians, he exclaim'd, Oh Lycians! where is your heroic might? Brave as I boast myself, I feel the task Arduous, through the breach made by myself To win a passage to the ships, alone. Follow me all—Most labourers, most dispatch ??????? ?? ??? ????? ???????.—This is evidently proverbial, for which reason I have given it that air in the translation.. So he; at whose sharp reprimand abash'd The embattled host to closer conflict moved, Obedient to their counsellor and King. On the other side the Greeks within the wall Made firm the phalanx, seeing urgent need; Nor could the valiant Lycians through the breach Admittance to the Greecian fleet obtain, Nor, since they first approach'd it, had the Greeks With all their efforts, thrust the Lycians back. But as two claimants of one common field, Each with his rod of measurement in hand, Dispute the boundaries, litigating warm Their right in some small portion of the soil, So they, divided by the barrier, struck With hostile rage the bull-hide bucklers round, And the light targets on each other's breast. Then many a wound the ruthless weapons made. Pierced through the unarm'd back, if any turn'd, He died, and numerous even through the shield. The battlements from end to end with blood Of Greecians and of Trojans on both sides Were sprinkled; yet no violence could move The stubborn Greeks, or turn their powers to flight. So hung the war in balance, as the scales Held by some woman scrupulously just, A spinner; wool and weight she poises nice, Hard-earning slender pittance for her babes, Such was the poise in which the battle hung, Till Jove himself superior fame, at length, To Priamëian Hector gave, who sprang First through the wall. In lofty sounds that reach'd Their utmost ranks, he call'd on all his host, Now press them, now ye Trojans steed-renown'd Rush on! break through the Greecian rampart, hurl At once devouring flames into the fleet. Such was his exhortation; they his voice All hearing, with close-order'd ranks direct Bore on the barrier, and upswarming show'd On the high battlement their glittering spears. But Hector seized a stone; of ample base But tapering to a point, before the gate It stood. No two men, mightiest of a land (Such men as now are mighty) could with ease Have heaved it from the earth up to a wain; He swung it easily alone; so light The son of Saturn made it in his hand. As in one hand with ease the shepherd bears A ram's fleece home, nor toils beneath the weight, So Hector, right toward the planks of those Majestic folding-gates, close-jointed, firm And solid, bore the stone. Two bars within Their corresponding force combined transverse To guard them, and one bolt secured the bars. He stood fast by them, parting wide his feet For 'vantage sake, and smote them in the midst. He burst both hinges; inward fell the rock Ponderous, and the portals roar'd; the bars Endured not, and the planks, riven by the force Of that huge mass, flew scatter'd on all sides. In leap'd the godlike Hero at the breach, Gloomy as night in aspect, but in arms All-dazzling, and he grasp'd two quivering spears. Him entering with a leap the gates, no force Whate'er of opposition had repress'd, Save of the Gods alone. Fire fill'd his eyes; Turning, he bade the multitude without Ascend the rampart; they his voice obey'd; Part climb'd the wall, part pour'd into the gate; The Greecians to their hollow galleys flew Scatter'd, and tumult infinite arose. END OF VOL. XI. Book XIII. ARGUMENT OF THE THIRTEENTH BOOK. Neptune engages on the part of the Greecians. The battle proceeds. Deiphobus advances to combat, but is repulsed by Meriones, who losing his spear, repairs to his tent for another. Teucer slays Imbrius, and Hector Amphimachus. Neptune, under the similitude of Thoas, exhorts Idomeneus. Idomeneus having armed himself in his tent, and going forth to battle, meets Meriones. After discourse held with each other, Idomeneus accommodates Meriones with a spear, and they proceed to battle. Idomeneus slays Othryoneus, and Asius. Deiphobus assails Idomeneus, but, his spear glancing over him, kills Hypsenor. Idomeneus slays Alcathoüs, son-in-law of Anchises. Deiphobus and Idomeneus respectively summon their friends to their assistance, and a contest ensues for the body of Alcathoüs. When Jove to Hector and his host had given Such entrance to the fleet, to all the woes And toils of unremitting battle there He them abandon'd, and his glorious eyes Averting, on the land look'd down remote Of the horse-breeding Thracians, of the bold Close-fighting Mysian race, and where abide On milk sustain'd, and blest with length of days, The Hippemolgi, justest of mankind. No longer now on Troy his eyes he turn'd, For expectation none within his breast Survived, that God or Goddess would the Greeks Approach with succour, or the Trojans more. Nor Neptune, sovereign of the boundless Deep, Look'd forth in vain; he on the summit sat Of Samothracia forest-crown'd, the stir Admiring thence and tempest of the field; For thence appear'd all Ida, thence the towers Of lofty Ilium, and the fleet of Greece. There sitting from the deeps uprisen, he mourn'd The vanquish'd Greecians, and resentment fierce Conceived and wrath against all-ruling Jove. Arising sudden, down the rugged steep With rapid strides he came; the mountains huge And forests under the immortal feet Trembled of Ocean's Sovereign as he strode. Three strides he made, the fourth convey'd him home To Ægæ. At the bottom of the abyss, There stands magnificent his golden fane, A dazzling incorruptible abode. Arrived, he to his chariot join'd his steeds Swift, brazen-hoof'd, and maned with wavy gold; Himself attiring next in gold, he seized His golden scourge, and to his seat sublime Ascending, o'er the billows drove; the whales Leaving their caverns, gambol'd on all sides Around him, not unconscious of their King; He swept the surge that tinged not as he pass'd His axle, and the sea parted for joy. His bounding coursers to the Greecian fleet Convey'd him swift. There is a spacious cave Deep in the bottom of the flood, the rocks Of Imbrus rude and Tenedos between; There Neptune, shaker of the shores, his steeds Station'd secure; he loosed them from the yoke, Gave them ambrosial food, and bound their feet With golden tethers not to be untied Or broken, that unwandering they might wait Their Lord's return, then sought the Greecian host. The Trojans, tempest-like or like a flame, Now, following Priameïan Hector, all Came furious on and shouting to the skies. Their hope was to possess the fleet, and leave Not an Achaian of the host unslain. But earth-encircler Neptune from the gulf Emerging, in the form and with the voice Loud-toned of Calchas, roused the Argive ranks To battle—and his exhortation first To either Ajax turn'd, themselves prepared. Ye heroes Ajax! your accustomed force Exert, oh! think not of disastrous flight, And ye shall save the people. Nought I fear Fatal elsewhere, although Troy's haughty sons Have pass'd the barrier with so fierce a throng Tumultuous; for the Greecians brazen-greaved Will check them there. Here only I expect And with much dread some dire event forebode, Where Hector, terrible as fire, and loud Vaunting his glorious origin from Jove, Leads on the Trojans. Oh that from on high Some God would form the purpose in your hearts To stand yourselves firmly, and to exhort The rest to stand! so should ye chase him hence All ardent as he is, and even although Olympian Jove himself his rage inspire. So Neptune spake, compasser of the earth, And, with his sceptre smiting both, their hearts Fill'd with fresh fortitude; their limbs the touch Made agile, wing'd their feet and nerved their arms. Then, swift as stoops a falcon from the point Of some rude rock sublime, when he would chase A fowl of other wing along the meads, So started Neptune thence, and disappear'd. Him, as he went, swift Oïliades First recognized, and, instant, thus his speech To Ajax, son of Telamon, address'd. Since, Ajax, some inhabitant of heaven Exhorts us, in the prophet's form to fight, (For prophet none or augur we have seen; This was not Calchas; as he went I mark'd His steps and knew him; Gods are known with ease.) I feel my spirit in my bosom fired Afresh for battle; lightness in my limbs, In hands and feet a glow unfelt before. To whom the son of Telamon replied. I also with invigorated hands More firmly grasp my spear, my courage mounts, A buoyant animation in my feet Bears me along, and I am all on fire To cope with Priam's furious son, alone. Thus they, with martial transport to their souls Imparted by the God, conferr'd elate. Meantime the King of Ocean roused the Greeks, Who in the rear, beside their gallant barks Some respite sought. They, spent with arduous toil, Felt not alone their weary limbs unapt To battle, but their hearts with grief oppress'd, Seeing the numerous multitude of Troy Within the mighty barrier; sad they view'd That sight, and bathed their cheeks with many a tear, Despairing of escape. But Ocean's Lord Entering among them, soon the spirit stirr'd Of every valiant phalanx to the fight. Teucer and Leïtus, and famed in arms Peneleus, Thoas and Deipyrus, Meriones, and his compeer renown'd, Antilochus; all these in accents wing'd With fierce alacrity the God address'd. Oh shame, ye Greecians! vigorous as ye are And in life's prime, to your exertions most I trusted for the safety of our ships. If ye renounce the labours of the field, Then hath the day arisen of our defeat And final ruin by the powers of Troy. Oh! I behold a prodigy, a sight Tremendous, deem'd impossible by me, The Trojans at our ships! the dastard race Fled once like fleetest hinds the destined prey Of lynxes, leopards, wolves; feeble and slight And of a nature indisposed to war They rove uncertain; so the Trojans erst Stood not, nor to Achaian prowess dared The hindrance of a moment's strife oppose. But now, Troy left afar, even at our ships They give us battle, through our leader's fault And through the people's negligence, who fill'd With fierce displeasure against him, prefer Death at their ships, to war in their defence. But if the son of Atreus, our supreme, If Agamemnon, have indeed transgress'd Past all excuse, dishonouring the swift Achilles, ye at least the fight decline Blame-worthy, and with no sufficient plea. But heal we speedily the breach; brave minds Easily coalesce. It is not well That thus your fury slumbers, for the host Hath none illustrious as yourselves in arms. I can excuse the timid if he shrink, But am incensed at you. My friends beware! Your tardiness will prove ere long the cause Of some worse evil. Let the dread of shame Affect your hearts; oh tremble at the thought Of infamy! Fierce conflict hath arisen, Loud shouting Hector combats at the ships Nobly, hath forced the gates and burst the bar. With such encouragement those Greecian chiefs The King of Ocean roused. Then, circled soon By many a phalanx either Ajax stood, Whose order Mars himself arriving there Had praised, or Pallas, patroness of arms. For there the flower of all expected firm Bold Hector and his host; spear crowded spear, Shield, helmet, man, press'd helmet, man and shield For this admirable line the Translator is indebted to Mr. Fuseli.; The hairy crests of their resplendent casques Kiss'd close at every nod, so wedged they stood; No spear was seen but in the manly grasp It quiver'd, and their every wish was war. The powers of Ilium gave the first assault Embattled close; them Hector led himself Right on, impetuous as a rolling rock Destructive; torn by torrent waters off From its old lodgement on the mountain's brow, It bounds, it shoots away; the crashing wood Falls under it; impediment or check None stays its fury, till the level found, There, settling by degrees, it rolls no more; So after many a threat that he would pass Easily through the Greecian camp and fleet And slay to the sea-brink, when Hector once Had fallen on those firm ranks, standing, he bore Vehement on them; but by many a spear Urged and bright faulchion, soon, reeling, retired, And call'd vociferous on the host of Troy. Trojans, and Lycians, and close-fighting sons Of Dardanus, oh stand! not long the Greeks Will me confront, although embodied close In solid phalanx; doubt it not; my spear Shall chase and scatter them, if Jove, in truth, High-thundering mate of Juno, bid me on. So saying he roused the courage of them all, Foremost of whom advanced, of Priam's race Deiphobus, ambitious of renown. Tripping he came with shorten'd steps A fitter occasion to remark on this singular mode of approach in battle, will present itself hereafter., his feet Sheltering behind his buckler; but at him Aiming, Meriones his splendid lance Dismiss'd, nor err'd; his bull-hide targe he struck But ineffectual; where the hollow wood Receives the inserted brass, the quivering beam Snapp'd; then, Deiphobus his shield afar Advanced before him, trembling at a spear Hurl'd by Meriones. He, moved alike With indignation for the victory lost And for his broken spear, into his band At first retired, but soon set forth again In progress through the Achaian camp, to fetch Its fellow-spear within his tent reserved. The rest all fought, and dread the shouts arose On all sides. Telamonian Teucer, first, Slew valiant Imbrius, son of Mentor, rich In herds of sprightly steeds. He ere the Greeks Arrived at Ilium, in Pedæus dwelt, And Priam's spurious daughter had espoused Medesicasta. But the barks well-oar'd Of Greece arriving, he return'd to Troy, Where he excell'd the noblest, and abode With Priam, loved and honour'd as his own. Him Teucer pierced beneath his ear, and pluck'd His weapon home; he fell as falls an ash Which on some mountain visible afar, Hewn from its bottom by the woodman's axe, With all its tender foliage meets the ground. So Imbrius fell; loud rang his armour bright With ornamental brass, and Teucer flew To seize his arms, whom hasting to the spoil Hector with his resplendent spear assail'd; He, marking opposite its rapid flight, Declined it narrowly and it pierced the breast, As he advanced to battle, of the son Of Cteatus of the Actorian race, Amphimachus; he, sounding, smote the plain, And all his batter'd armour rang aloud. Then Hector swift approaching, would have torn The well-forged helmet from the brows away Of brave Amphimachus; but Ajax hurl'd Right forth at Hector hasting to the spoil His radiant spear; no wound the spear impress'd, For he was arm'd complete in burnish'd brass Terrific; but the solid boss it pierced Of Hector's shield, and with enormous force So shock'd him, that retiring he resign'd Both bodies The bodies of Imbrius and Amphimachus., which the Greecians dragg'd away. Stichius and Menestheus, leaders both Of the Athenians, to the host of Greece Bore off Amphimachus, and, fierce in arms The Ajaces, Imbrius. As two lions bear Through thick entanglement of boughs and brakes A goat snatch'd newly from the peasants' dogs, Upholding high their prey above the ground, So either Ajax terrible in fight, Upholding Imbrius high, his brazen arms Tore off, and Oïliades his head From his smooth neck dissevering in revenge For slain Amphimachus, through all the host Sent it with swift rotation like a globe, Till in the dust at Hector's feet it fell. Then anger fill'd the heart of Ocean's King, His grandson Amphimachus. slain in battle; forth he pass'd Through the Achaian camp and fleet, the Greeks Rousing, and meditating woe to Troy. It chanced that brave Idomeneus return'd That moment from a Cretan at the knee Wounded, and newly borne into his tent; His friends had borne him off, and when the Chief Had given him into skilful hands, he sought The field again, still coveting renown. Him therefore, meeting him on his return, Neptune bespake, but with the borrow'd voice Of Thoas, offspring of Andræmon, King In Pleuro and in lofty Calydon, And honour'd by the Ætolians as a God. Oh counsellor of Crete! our threats denounced Against the towers of Troy, where are they now? To whom the leader of the Cretans, thus, Idomeneus. For aught that I perceive Thoas! no Greecian is this day in fault! For we are all intelligent in arms, None yields by fear oppress'd, none lull'd by sloth From battle shrinks, but such the pleasure seems Of Jove himself, that we should perish here Inglorious, from our country far remote. But, Thoas! (for thine heart was ever firm In battle, and thyself art wont to rouse Whom thou observ'st remiss) now also fight As erst, and urge each leader of the host. Him answered, then, the Sovereign of the Deep. Return that Greecian never from the shores Of Troy, Idomeneus! but may the dogs Feast on him, who shall this day intermit Through wilful negligence his force in fight! But haste, take arms and come; we must exert All diligence, that, being only two, We yet may yield some service. Union much Emboldens even the weakest, and our might Hath oft been proved on warriors of renown. So Neptune spake, and, turning, sought again The toilsome field. Ere long, Idomeneus Arriving in his spacious tent, put on His radiant armour, and, two spears in hand, Set forth like lightning which Saturnian Jove From bright Olympus shakes into the air, A sign to mortal men, dazzling all eyes; So beam'd the Hero's armour as he ran. But him not yet far distant from his tent Meriones, his fellow-warrior met, For he had left the fight, seeking a spear, When thus the brave Idomeneus began. Swift son of Molus! chosen companion dear! Wherefore, Meriones, hast thou the field Abandon'd? Art thou wounded? Bring'st thou home Some pointed mischief in thy flesh infixt? Or comest thou sent to me, who of myself The still tent covet not, but feats of arms? To whom Meriones discrete replied. Chief leader of the Cretans, brazen-mail'd Idomeneus! if yet there be a spear Left in thy tent, I seek one; for I broke The spear, even now, with which erewhile I fought, Smiting the shield of fierce Deiphobus. Then answer thus the Cretan Chief return'd, Valiant Idomeneus. If spears thou need, Within my tent, leaning against the wall, Stand twenty spears and one, forged all in Troy, Which from the slain I took; for distant fight Me suits not; therefore in my tent have I Both spears and bossy shields, with brazen casques And corslets bright that smile against the sun. Him answer'd, then, Meriones discrete. I also, at my tent and in my ship Have many Trojan spoils, but they are hence Far distant. I not less myself than thou Am ever mindful of a warrior's part, And when the din of glorious arms is heard, Fight in the van. If other Greeks my deeds Know not, at least I judge them known to thee. To whom the leader of the host of Crete Idomeneus. I know thy valour well, Why speakest thus to me? Chose we this day An ambush forth of all the bravest Greeks, (For in the ambush is distinguish'd best The courage; there the timorous and the bold Plainly appear; the dastard changes hue And shifts from place to place, nor can he calm The fears that shake his trembling limbs, but sits Low-crouching on his hams, while in his breast Quick palpitates his death-foreboding heart, And his teeth chatter; but the valiant man His posture shifts not; no excessive fears Feels he, but seated once in ambush, deems Time tedious till the bloody fight begin;) Even there, thy courage should no blame incur. For should'st thou, toiling in the fight, by spear Or faulchion bleed, not on thy neck behind Would fall the weapon, or thy back annoy, But it would meet thy bowels or thy chest While thou didst rush into the clamorous van. But haste—we may not longer loiter here As children prating, lest some sharp rebuke Reward us. Enter quick, and from within My tent provide thee with a noble spear. Then, swift as Mars, Meriones produced A brazen spear of those within the tent Reserved, and kindling with heroic fire Follow'd Idomeneus. As gory Mars By Terrour follow'd, his own dauntless son Who quells the boldest heart, to battle moves; From Thrace against the Ephyri they arm, Or hardy Phlegyans, and by both invoked, Hear and grant victory to which they please; Such, bright in arms Meriones, and such Idomeneus advanced, when foremost thus Meriones his fellow-chief bespake. Son of Deucalion! where inclinest thou most To enter into battle? On the right Of all the host? or through the central ranks? Or on the left? for nowhere I account The Greeks so destitute of force as there. Then answer thus Idomeneus return'd Chief of the Cretans. Others stand to guard The middle fleet; there either Ajax wars, And Teucer, noblest archer of the Greeks, Nor less in stationary fight approved. Bent as he is on battle, they will task And urge to proof sufficiently the force Of Priameian Hector; burn his rage How fierce soever, he shall find it hard, With all his thirst of victory, to quell Their firm resistance, and to fire the fleet, Let not Saturnian Jove cast down from heaven Himself a flaming brand into the ships. High towering Telamonian Ajax yields To no mere mortal by the common gift Sustain'd of Ceres, and whose flesh the spear Can penetrate, or rocky fragment bruise; In standing fight Ajax would not retire Even before that breaker of the ranks Achilles, although far less swift than He. But turn we to the left, that we may learn At once, if glorious death, or life be ours. Then, rapid as the God of war, his course Meriones toward the left began, As he enjoin'd. Soon as the Trojans saw Idomeneus advancing like a flame, And his compeer Meriones in arms All-radiant clad, encouraging aloud From rank to rank each other, on they came To the assault combined. Then soon arose Sharp contest on the left of all the fleet. As when shrill winds blow vehement, what time Dust deepest spreads the ways, by warring blasts Upborne a sable cloud stands in the air, Such was the sudden conflict; equal rage To stain with gore the lance ruled every breast. Horrent with quivering spears the fatal field Frown'd on all sides; the brazen flashes dread Of numerous helmets, corslets furbish'd bright, And shields refulgent meeting, dull'd the eye, And turn'd it dark away. Stranger indeed Were he to fear, who could that strife have view'd With heart elate, or spirit unperturb'd. Two mighty sons of Saturn adverse parts Took in that contest, purposing alike To many a valiant Chief sorrow and pain. Jove, for the honour of Achilles, gave Success to Hector and the host of Troy, Not for complete destruction of the Greeks At Ilium, but that glory might redound To Thetis thence, and to her dauntless son. On the other side, the King of Ocean risen Secretly from the hoary Deep, the host Of Greece encouraged, whom he grieved to see Vanquish'd by Trojans, and with anger fierce Against the Thunderer burn'd on their behalf. Alike from one great origin divine Sprang they, but Jove was elder, and surpass'd In various knowledge; therefore when he roused Their courage, Neptune traversed still the ranks Clandestine, and in human form disguised. Thus, these Immortal Two, straining the cord Indissoluble of all-wasting war, Alternate measured with it either host, And loosed the joints of many a warrior bold. Then, loud exhorting (though himself with age Half grey,) the Achaians, into battle sprang Idomeneus, and scatter'd, first, the foe, Slaying Othryoneus, who, by the lure Of martial glory drawn, had left of late Cabesus. He Priam's fair daughter woo'd Cassandra, but no nuptial gift vouchsafed It was customary for the suitor to pay the dower. To offer, save a sounding promise proud To chase, himself, however resolute The Greecian host, and to deliver Troy. To him assenting, Priam, ancient King, Assured to him his wish, and in the faith Of that assurance confident, he fought. But brave Idomeneus his splendid lance Well-aim'd dismissing, struck the haughty Chief, Pacing elate the field; his brazen mail Endured not; through his bowels pierced, with clang Of all his arms he fell, and thus with joy Immense exulting, spake Idomeneus. I give thee praise, Othryoneus! beyond All mortal men, if truly thou perform Thy whole big promise to the Dardan king, Who promised thee his daughter. Now, behold, We also promise: doubt not the effect. We give into thy arms the most admired Of Agamemnon's daughters, whom ourselves Will hither bring from Argos, if thy force With ours uniting, thou wilt rase the walls Of populous Troy. Come—follow me; that here Among the ships we may adjust the terms Of marriage, for we take not scanty dower. So saying, the Hero dragg'd him by his heel Through all the furious fight. His death to avenge Asius on foot before his steeds advanced, For them, where'er he moved, his charioteer Kept breathing ever on his neck behind. With fierce desire the heart of Asius burn'd To smite Idomeneus, who with his lance Him reaching first, pierced him beneath the chin Into his throat, and urged the weapon through. He fell, as some green poplar falls, or oak, Or lofty pine, by naval artists hewn With new-edged axes on the mountain's side. So, his teeth grinding, and the bloody dust Clenching, before his chariot and his steeds Extended, Asius lay. His charioteer (All recollection lost) sat panic-stunn'd, Nor dared for safety turn his steeds to flight. Him bold Antilochus right through the waist Transpierced; his mail sufficed not, but the spear Implanted in his midmost bowels stood. Down from his seat magnificent he fell Panting, and young Antilochus the steeds Drove captive thence into the host of Greece. Then came Deiphobus by sorrow urged For Asius, and, small interval between, Hurl'd at Idomeneus his glittering lance; But he, foreseeing its approach, the point Eluded, cover'd whole by his round shield Of hides and brass by double belt sustain'd, And it flew over him, but on his targe Glancing, elicited a tinkling sound. Yet left it not in vain his vigorous grasp, But pierced the liver of Hypsenor, son Of Hippasus; he fell incontinent, And measureless exulting in his fall Deiphobus with mighty voice exclaim'd. Not unavenged lies Asius; though he seek Hell's iron portals, yet shall he rejoice, For I have given him a conductor home. So he, whose vaunt the Greeks indignant heard; But of them all to anger most he roused Antilochus, who yet his breathless friend Hypsenor. Left not, but, hasting, fenced him with his shield, And brave Alastor with Mecisteus son Of Echius, bore him to the hollow ships Deep-groaning both, for of their band was he. Nor yet Idomeneus his warlike rage Remitted aught, but persevering strove Either to plunge some Trojan in the shades, Or fall himself, guarding the fleet of Greece. Then slew he brave Alcathoüs the son Of Æsyeta, and the son-in-law Of old Anchises, who to him had given The eldest-born of all his daughters fair, Hippodamia; dearly loved was she By both her parents in her virgin state This seems to be the meaning of ?? ??????, an expression similar to that of Demosthenes in a parallel case—??? ????? ?????. —See Schaufelburgerus., For that in beauty she surpass'd, in works Ingenious, and in faculties of mind All her coevals; wherefore she was deem'd Well worthy of the noblest prince of Troy. Him in that moment, Neptune by the arm Quell'd of Idomeneus, his radiant eyes Dimming, and fettering his proportion'd limbs. All power of flight or to elude the stroke Forsook him, and while motionless he stood As stands a pillar tall or towering oak, The hero of the Cretans with a spear Transfix'd his middle chest. He split the mail Erewhile his bosom's faithful guard; shrill rang The shiver'd brass; sounding he fell; the beam Implanted in his palpitating heart Shook to its topmost point, but, its force spent, At last, quiescent, stood. Then loud exclaim'd Idomeneus, exulting in his fall. What thinks Deiphobus? seems it to thee Vain boaster, that, three warriors slain for one, We yield thee just amends? else, stand thyself Against me; learn the valour of a Chief The progeny of Jove; Jove first begat Crete's guardian, Minos, from which Minos sprang Deucalion, and from famed Deucalion, I; I, sovereign of the numerous race of Crete's Extensive isle, and whom my galleys brought To these your shores at last, that I might prove Thy curse, thy father's, and a curse to Troy. He spake; Deiphobus uncertain stood Whether, retreating, to engage the help Of some heroic Trojan, or himself To make the dread experiment alone. At length, as his discreter course, he chose To seek Æneas; him he found afar Station'd, remotest of the host of Troy, For he resented evermore his worth By Priam He is said to have been jealous of him on account of his great popularity, and to have discountenanced him, fearing a conspiracy in his favour to the prejudice of his own family. —See Villoisson. recompensed with cold neglect. Approaching him, in accents wing'd he said. Æneas! Trojan Chief! If e'er thou lov'dst Thy sister's husband, duty calls thee now To prove it. Haste—defend with me the dead Alcathoüs, guardian of thy tender years, Slain by Idomeneus the spear-renown'd. So saying, he roused his spirit, and on fire To combat with the Cretan, forth he sprang. But fear seized not Idomeneus as fear May seize a nursling boy; resolved he stood As in the mountains, conscious of his force, The wild boar waits a coming multitude Of boisterous hunters to his lone retreat; Arching his bristly spine he stands, his eyes Beam fire, and whetting his bright tusks, he burns To drive, not dogs alone, but men to flight; So stood the royal Cretan, and fled not, Expecting brave Æneas; yet his friends He summon'd, on Ascalaphus his eyes Fastening, on Aphareus, Deipyrus, Meriones, and Antilochus, all bold In battle, and in accents wing'd exclaim'd. Haste ye, my friends! to aid me, for I stand Alone, nor undismay'd the coming wait Of swift Æneas, nor less brave than swift, And who possesses fresh his flower of youth, Man's prime advantage; were we match'd in years As in our spirits, either he should earn At once the meed of deathless fame, or I. He said; they all unanimous approach'd, Sloping their shields, and stood. On the other side His aids Æneas call'd, with eyes toward Paris, Deiphobus, Agenor, turn'd, His fellow-warriors bold; them follow'd all Their people as the pastured flock the ram To water, by the shepherd seen with joy; Such joy Æneas felt, seeing, so soon, That numerous host attendant at his call. Then, for Alcathoüs, into contest close Arm'd with long spears they rush'd; on every breast Dread rang the brazen corslet, each his foe Assailing opposite; but two, the rest Surpassing far, terrible both as Mars, Æneas and Idomeneus, alike Panted to pierce each other with the spear. Æneas, first, cast at Idomeneus, But, warn'd, he shunn'd the weapon, and it pass'd. Quivering in the soil Æneas' lance Stood, hurl'd in vain, though by a forceful arm. Not so the Cretan; at his waist he pierced Oenomaüs, his hollow corslet clave, And in his midmost bowels drench'd the spear; Down fell the Chief, and dying, clench'd the dust. Instant, his massy spear the King of Crete Pluck'd from the dead, but of his radiant arms Despoil'd him not, by numerous weapons urged; For now, time-worn, he could no longer make Brisk sally, spring to follow his own spear, Or shun another, or by swift retreat Vanish from battle, but the evil day Warded in stationary fight alone. At him retiring, therefore, step by step Deiphobus, who had with bitterest hate Long time pursued him, hurl'd his splendid lance, But yet again erroneous, for he pierced Ascalaphus instead, offspring of Mars; Right through his shoulder flew the spear; he fell Incontinent, and dying, clench'd the dust. But tidings none the brazen-throated Mars Tempestuous yet received, that his own son In bloody fight had fallen, for on the heights Olympian over-arch'd with clouds of gold He sat, where sat the other Powers divine, Prisoners together of the will of Jove. Meantime, for slain Ascalaphus arose Conflict severe; Deiphobus his casque Resplendent seized, but swift as fiery Mars Assailing him, Meriones his arm Pierced with a spear, and from his idle hand Fallen, the casque sonorous struck the ground. Again, as darts the vulture on his prey, Meriones assailing him, the lance Pluck'd from his arm, and to his band retired. Then, casting his fraternal arms around Deiphobus, him young Polites led From the hoarse battle to his rapid steeds And his bright chariot in the distant rear, Which bore him back to Troy, languid and loud- Groaning, and bleeding from his recent wound. Still raged the war, and infinite arose The clamour. Aphareus, Caletor's son, Turning to face Æneas, in his throat Instant the Hero's pointed lance received. With head reclined, and bearing to the ground Buckler and helmet with him, in dark shades Of soul-divorcing death involved, he fell. Antilochus, observing Thoön turn'd To flight, that moment pierced him; from his back He ripp'd the vein which through the trunk its course Winds upward to the neck; that vein he ripp'd All forth; supine he fell, and with both hands Extended to his fellow-warriors, died. Forth sprang Antilochus to strip his arms But watch'd, meantime, the Trojans, who in crowds Encircling him, his splendid buckler broad Smote oft, but none with ruthless point prevail'd Even to inscribe the skin of Nestor's son, Whom Neptune, shaker of the shores, amid Innumerable darts kept still secure. Yet never from his foes he shrank, but faced From side to side, nor idle slept his spear, But with rotation ceaseless turn'd and turn'd To every part, now levell'd at a foe Far-distant, at a foe, now, near at hand. Nor he, thus occupied, unseen escaped By Asius' offspring Adamas, who close Advancing, struck the centre of his shield. But Neptune azure-hair'd so dear a life Denied to Adamas, and render'd vain The weapon; part within his disk remain'd Like a seer'd stake, and part fell at his feet. Then Adamas, for his own life alarm'd, Retired, but as he went, Meriones Him reaching with his lance, the shame between And navel pierced him, where the stroke of Mars Proves painful most to miserable man. There enter'd deep the weapon; down he fell, And in the dust lay panting as an ox Among the mountains pants by peasants held In twisted bands, and dragg'd perforce along; So panted dying Adamas, but soon Ceased, for Meriones, approaching, pluck'd The weapon forth, and darkness veil'd his eyes. Helenus, with his heavy Thracian blade Smiting the temples of Deipyrus, Dash'd off his helmet; from his brows remote It fell, and wandering roll'd, till at his feet Some warrior found it, and secured; meantime The sightless shades of death him wrapp'd around. Grief at that spectacle the bosom fill'd Of valiant Menelaus; high he shook His radiant spear, and threatening him, advanced On royal Helenus, who ready stood With his bow bent. They met; impatient, one, To give his pointed lance its rapid course, And one, to start his arrow from the nerve. The arrow of the son of Priam struck Atrides' hollow corslet, but the reed Glanced wide. As vetches or as swarthy beans Leap from the van and fly athwart the floor, By sharp winds driven, and by the winnower's force, So from the corslet of the glorious Greek Wide-wandering flew the bitter shaft away. But Menelaus the left-hand transpierced Of Helenus, and with the lance's point Fasten'd it to his bow; shunning a stroke More fatal, Helenus into his band Retired, his arm dependent at his side, And trailing, as he went, the ashen beam; There, bold Agenor from his hand the lance Drew forth, then folded it with softest wool Around, sling-wool, and borrow'd from the sling Which his attendant into battle bore. Then sprang Pisander on the glorious Chief The son of Atreus, but his evil fate Beckon'd him to his death in conflict fierce, Oh Menelaus, mighty Chief! with thee. And now they met, small interval between. Atrides hurl'd his weapon, and it err'd. Pisander with his spear struck full the shield Of glorious Menelaus, but his force Resisted by the stubborn buckler broad Fail'd to transpierce it, and the weapon fell Snapp'd at the neck. Yet, when he struck, the heart Rebounded of Pisander, full of hope. But Menelaus, drawing his bright blade, Sprang on him, while Pisander from behind His buckler drew a brazen battle-axe By its long haft of polish'd olive-wood, And both Chiefs struck together. He the crest That crown'd the shaggy casque of Atreus' son Hew'd from its base, but Menelaus him In his swift onset smote full on the front Above his nose; sounded the shatter'd bone, And his eyes both fell bloody at his feet. Convolved with pain he lay; then, on his breast Atrides setting fast his heel, tore off His armour, and exulting thus began. So shall ye leave at length the Greecian fleet, Traitors, and never satisfied with war! Nor want ye other guilt, dogs and profane! But me have injured also, and defied The hot displeasure of high-thundering Jove The Hospitable, who shall waste in time, And level with the dust your lofty Troy. I wrong'd not you, yet bore ye far away My youthful bride who welcomed you, and stole My treasures also, and ye now are bent To burn Achaia's gallant fleet with fire And slay her Heroes; but your furious thirst Of battle shall hereafter meet a check. Oh, Father Jove! Thee wisest we account In heaven or earth, yet from thyself proceed All these calamities, who favour show'st To this flagitious race the Trojans, strong In wickedness alone, and whose delight In war and bloodshed never can be cloy'd. All pleasures breed satiety, sweet sleep, Soft dalliance, music, and the graceful dance, Though sought with keener appetite by most Than bloody war; but Troy still covets blood. So spake the royal Chief, and to his friends Pisander's gory spoils consigning, flew To mingle in the foremost fight again. Him, next, Harpalion, offspring of the King Pylæmenes assail'd; to Troy he came Following his sire, but never thence return'd. He, from small distance, smote the central boss Of Menelaus' buckler with his lance, But wanting power to pierce it, with an eye Of cautious circumspection, lest perchance Some spear should reach him, to his band retired. But him retiring with a brazen shaft Meriones pursued; swift flew the dart To his right buttock, slipp'd beneath the bone, His bladder grazed, and started through before. There ended his retreat; sudden he sank And like a worm lay on the ground, his life Exhaling in his fellow-warrior's arms, And with his sable blood soaking the plain. Around him flock'd his Paphlagonians bold, And in his chariot placed drove him to Troy, With whom his father went, mourning with tears A son, whose death he never saw avenged. Him slain with indignation Paris view'd, For he, with numerous Paphlagonians more, His guest had been, he, therefore, in the thirst Of vengeance, sent a brazen arrow forth. There was a certain Greek, Euchenor, son Of Polyides the soothsayer, rich And brave in fight, and who in Corinth dwelt. He, knowing well his fate, yet sail'd to Troy. For Polyides oft, his reverend sire, Had prophecied that he should either die By some dire malady at home, or, slain By Trojan hands, amid the fleet of Greece. He, therefore, shunning the reproach alike Of the Achaians, and that dire disease, Had join'd the Greecian host; him Paris pierced The ear and jaw beneath; life at the stroke Left him, and darkness overspread his eyes. So raged the battle like devouring fire. But Hector dear to Jove not yet had learn'd, Nor aught surmised the havoc of his host Made on the left, where victory crown'd well-nigh The Greecians animated to the fight By Neptune seconding himself their arms. He, where he first had started through the gate After dispersion of the shielded Greeks Compact, still persevered. The galleys there Of Ajax and Protesilaüs stood Updrawn above the hoary Deep; the wall Was there of humblest structure, and the steeds And warriors there conflicted furious most. The Epeans there and Iäonians The Iäonians were a distinct people from the Ionians, and according to the Scholium, separated from them by a pillar bearing on opposite sides the name of each. —See Barnes. See also Villoisson. robed— Prolix, the Phthians The people of Achilles were properly called the Phthiotæ; whereas the Phthians belonged to Protesiläus and Philoctetes. —See Eustathius, as quoted by Clarke., Locrians, and the bold Bœotians check'd the terrible assault Of Hector, noble Chief, ardent as flame, Yet not repulsed him. Chosen Athenians form'd The van, by Peteos' son, Menestheus, led, Whose high command undaunted Bias shared, Phidas and Stichius. The Epean host Under Amphion, Dracius, Meges, fought. Podarces brave in arms the Phthians ruled, And Medon (Medon was by spurious birth Brother of Ajax Oïliades, And for his uncle's death, whom he had slain, The brother of Oïleus' wife, abode In Phylace; but from Iphiclus sprang Podarces;) these, all station'd in the front Of Phthias' hardy sons, together strove With the Bœotians for the fleet's defence. Ajax the swift swerved never from the side Of Ajax son of Telamon a step, But as in some deep fallow two black steers Labour combined, dragging the ponderous plough, The briny sweat around their rooted horns Oozes profuse; they, parted as they toil Along the furrow, by the yoke alone, Cleave to its bottom sheer the stubborn glebe, So, side by side, they, persevering fought. The son of Telamon a people led Numerous and bold, who, when his bulky limbs Fail'd overlabour'd, eased him of his shield. Not so attended by his Locrians fought Oïleus' valiant son; pitch'd battle them Suited not, unprovided with bright casques Of hairy crest, with ashen spears, and shields Of ample orb; for, trusting in the bow And twisted sling alone, they came to Troy, And broke with shafts and volley'd stones the ranks. Thus occupying, clad in burnish'd arms, The van, these Two with Hector and his host Conflicted, while the Locrians from behind Vex'd them with shafts, secure; nor could the men Of Ilium stand, by such a shower confused. Then, driven with dreadful havoc thence, the foe To wind-swept Ilium had again retired, Had not Polydamas, at Hector's side Standing, the dauntless Hero thus address'd. Hector! Thou ne'er canst listen to advice; But think'st thou, that if heaven in feats of arms Give thee pre-eminence, thou must excel Therefore in council also all mankind? No. All-sufficiency is not for thee. To one, superior force in arms is given, Skill, to another, in the graceful dance, Sweet song and powers of music to a third, And to a fourth loud-thundering Jove imparts Wisdom, which profits many, and which saves Whole cities oft, though reverenced but by few. Yet hear; I speak as wisest seems to me. War, like a fiery circle, all around Environs thee; the Trojans, since they pass'd The bulwark, either hold themselves aloof, Or, wide-dispersed among the galleys, cope With numbers far superior to their own. Retiring, therefore, summon all our Chiefs To consultation on the sum of all, Whether (should heaven so prosper us) to rush Impetuous on the gallant barks of Greece, Or to retreat secure; for much I dread Lest the Achaians punctually refund All yesterday's arrear, since yonder Chief Achilles Insatiable with battle still abides Within the fleet, nor longer, as I judge, Will rest a mere spectator of the field. So spake Polydamas, whose safe advice Pleased Hector; from his chariot down he leap'd All arm'd, and in wing'd accents thus replied. Polydamas! here gather all the Chiefs; I haste into the fight, and my commands Once issued there, incontinent return. He ended, and conspicuous as the height Of some snow-crested mountain, shouting ranged The Trojans and confederates of Troy. They swift around Polydamas, brave son Of Panthus, at the voice of Hector, ran. Himself with hasty strides the front, meantime, Of battle roam'd, seeking from rank to rank Asius Hyrtacides, with Asius' son Adamas, and Deiphobus, and the might Of Helenus, his royal brother bold. Them neither altogether free from hurt He found, nor living all. Beneath the sterns Of the Achaian ships some slaughter'd lay By Greecian hands; some stricken by the spear Within the rampart sat, some by the sword. But leftward of the woeful field he found, Ere long, bright Helen's paramour his band Exhorting to the fight. Hector approach'd, And him, in fierce displeasure, thus bespake. Curst Paris, specious, fraudulent and lewd! Where is Deiphobus, and where the might Of royal Helenus? Where Adamas Offspring of Asius, and where Asius, son Of Hyrtacus, and where Othryoneus? Now lofty Ilium from her topmost height Falls headlong, now is thy own ruin sure. To whom the Godlike Paris thus replied. Since Hector! thou art pleased with no just cause To censure me, I may decline, perchance, Much more the battle on some future day, For I profess some courage, even I. Witness our constant conflict with the Greeks Here, on this spot, since first led on by thee The host of Troy waged battle at the ships. But those our friends of whom thou hast enquired Are slain, Deiphobus alone except And royal Helenus, who in the hand Bear each a wound inflicted by the spear, And have retired; but Jove their life preserved. Come now—conduct us whither most thine heart Prompts thee, and thou shalt find us ardent all To face like danger; what we can, we will, The best and most determined can no more. So saying, the Hero soothed his brother's mind. Then moved they both toward the hottest war Together, where Polydamas the brave, Phalces, Cebriones, Orthæus fought, Palmys and Polyphœtes, godlike Chief, And Morys and Ascanius, gallant sons Both of Hippotion. They at Troy arrived From fair Ascania the preceding morn, In recompense for aid This, according to Eustathius, is the import of ???????. —See Iliad 111. —in which Priam relates an expedition of his into that country. by Priam lent Erewhile to Phrygia, and, by Jove impell'd, Now waged the furious battle side by side. The march of these at once, was as the sound Of mighty winds from deep-hung thunder-clouds Descending; clamorous the blast and wild With ocean mingles; many a billow, then, Upridged rides turbulent the sounding flood, Foam-crested, billow after billow driven, So moved the host of Troy, rank after rank Behind their Chiefs, all dazzling bright in arms. Before them Priameian Hector strode Fierce as gore-tainted Mars, and his broad shield Advancing came, heavy with hides, and thick- Plated with brass; his helmet on his brows Refulgent shook, and in its turn he tried The force of every phalanx, if perchance Behind his broad shield pacing he might shake Their stedfast order; but he bore not down The spirit of the firm Achaian host. Then Ajax striding forth, him, first, defied. Approach. Why temptest thou the Greeks to fear? No babes are we in aught that appertains To arms, though humbled by the scourge of Jove. Thou cherishest the foolish hope to burn Our fleet with fire; but even we have hearts Prepared to guard it, and your populous Troy, By us dismantled and to pillage given, Shall perish sooner far. Know this thyself Also; the hour is nigh when thou shalt ask In prayer to Jove and all the Gods of heaven, That speed more rapid than the falcon's flight May wing thy coursers, while, exciting dense The dusty plain, they whirl thee back to Troy. While thus he spake, sublime on the right-hand An eagle soar'd; confident in the sign The whole Achaian host with loud acclaim Hail'd it. Then glorious Hector thus replied. Brainless and big, what means this boast of thine, Earth-cumberer Ajax? Would I were the son As sure, for ever, of almighty Jove And Juno, and such honour might receive Henceforth as Pallas and Apollo share, As comes this day with universal woe Fraught for the Greecians, among whom thyself Shalt also perish if thou dare abide My massy spear, which shall thy pamper'd flesh Disfigure, and amid the barks of Greece Falling, thou shalt the vultures with thy bulk Enormous satiate, and the dogs of Troy. He spake, and led his host; with clamour loud They follow'd him, and all the distant rear Came shouting on. On the other side the Greeks Re-echoed shout for shout, all undismay'd, And waiting firm the bravest of their foes. Upwent the double roar into the heights Ethereal, and among the beams of Jove. BOOK XIV. ARGUMENT OF THE FOURTEENTH BOOK. Agamemnon and the other wounded Chiefs taking Nestor with them, visit the battle. Juno having borrowed the Cestus of Venus, first engages the assistance of Sleep, then hastes to Ida to inveigle Jove. She prevails. Jove sleeps; and Neptune takes that opportunity to succour the Greecians. Nor was that cry by Nestor unperceived Though drinking, who in words wing'd with surprise The son of Æsculapius thus address'd. Divine Machaon! think what this may bode. The cry of our young warriors at the ships Grows louder; sitting here, the sable wine Quaff thou, while bright-hair'd Hecamede warms A bath, to cleanse thy crimson stains away. I from yon eminence will learn the cause. So saying, he took a shield radiant with brass There lying in the tent, the shield well-forged Of valiant Thrasymedes, his own son, (For he had borne to fight his father's shield) And arming next his hand with a keen lance Stood forth before the tent. Thence soon he saw Foul deeds and strange, the Greecian host confused, Their broken ranks flying before the host Of Ilium, and the rampart overthrown. As when the wide sea, darken'd over all Its silent flood, forebodes shrill winds to blow, The doubtful waves roll yet to neither side, Till swept at length by a decisive gale; So stood the senior, with distressful doubts Conflicting anxious, whether first to seek The Greecian host, or Agamemnon's self The sovereign, and at length that course preferr'd. Meantime with mutual carnage they the field Spread far and wide, and by spears double-edged Smitten, and by the sword their corslets rang. The royal Chiefs ascending from the fleet, Ulysses, Diomede, and Atreus' son Imperial Agamemnon, who had each Bled in the battle, met him on his way. For from the war remote they had updrawn Their galleys on the shore of the gray Deep, The foremost to the plain, and at the sterns Of that exterior line had built the wall. For, spacious though it were, the shore alone That fleet sufficed not, incommoding much The people; wherefore they had ranged the ships Line above line gradual, and the bay Between both promontories, all was fill'd. They, therefore, curious to survey the fight, Came forth together, leaning on the spear, When Nestor met them; heavy were their hearts, And at the sight of Him still more alarm'd, Whom royal Agamemnon thus bespake. Neleian Nestor, glory of the Greeks! What moved thee to forsake yon bloody field, And urged thee hither? Cause I see of fear, Lest furious Hector even now his threat Among the Trojans publish'd, verify, That he would never enter Ilium more Till he had burn'd our fleet, and slain ourselves. So threaten'd Hector, and shall now perform. Alas! alas! the Achaians brazen-greaved All, like Achilles, have deserted me Resentful, and decline their fleet's defence. To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied. Those threats are verified; nor Jove himself The Thunderer can disappoint them now; For our chief strength in which we trusted most That it should guard impregnably secure Our navy and ourselves, the wall hath fallen. Hence all this conflict by our host sustain'd Among the ships; nor could thy keenest sight Inform thee where in the Achaian camp Confusion most prevails, such deaths are dealt Promiscuous, and the cry ascends to heaven. But come—consult we on the sum of all, If counsel yet may profit. As for you, Ye shall have exhortation none from me To seek the fight; the wounded have excuse. Whom Agamemnon answer'd, King of men. Ah Nestor! if beneath our very sterns The battle rage, if neither trench nor wall Constructed with such labour, and supposed Of strength to guard impregnably secure Our navy and ourselves, avail us aught, It is because almighty Jove hath will'd That the Achaian host should perish here Inglorious, from their country far remote. When he vouchsafed assistance to the Greeks, I knew it well; and now, not less I know That high as the immortal Gods he lifts Our foes to glory, and depresses us. Haste therefore all, and act as I advise. Our ships—all those that nearest skirt the Deep, Launch we into the sacred flood, and moor With anchors safely, till o'ershadowing night (If night itself may save us) shall arrive. Then may we launch the rest; for I no shame Account it, even by 'vantage of the night To fly destruction. Wiser him I deem Who 'scapes his foe, than whom his foe enthralls. But him Ulysses, frowning stern, reproved. What word, Atrides, now hath pass'd thy lips? Counsellor of despair! thou should'st command (And would to heaven thou didst) a different host, Some dastard race, not ours; whom Jove ordains From youth to hoary age to weave the web Of toilsome warfare, till we perish all. Wilt thou the spacious city thus renounce For which such numerous woes we have endured? Hush! lest some other hear; it is a word Which no man qualified by years mature To speak discreetly, no man bearing rule O'er such a people as confess thy sway, Should suffer to contaminate his lips. I from my soul condemn thee, and condemn Thy counsel, who persuad'st us in the heat Of battle terrible as this, to launch Our fleet into the waves, that we may give Our too successful foes their full desire, And that our own prepondering scale May plunge us past all hope; for while they draw Their galleys down, the Greecians shall but ill Sustain the fight, seaward will cast their eyes And shun the battle, bent on flight alone. Then shall they rue thy counsel, King of men! To whom the imperial leader of the Greeks. Thy sharp reproof, Ulysses, hath my soul Pierced deeply. Yet I gave no such command That the Achaians should their galleys launch, Would they, or would they not. No. I desire That, young or old, some other may advice More prudent give, and he shall please me well. Then thus the gallant Diomede replied. That man is near, and may ye but be found Tractable, our enquiry shall be short. Be patient each, nor chide me or reproach Because I am of greener years than ye, For I am sprung from an illustrious Sire, From Tydeus, who beneath his hill of earth Lies now entomb'd at Thebes. Three noble sons Were born to Portheus, who in Pleuro dwelt, And on the heights of Calydon; the first Agrius; the second Melas; and the third Brave Oeneus, father of my father, famed For virtuous qualities above the rest. Oeneus still dwelt at home; but wandering thence, My father dwelt in Argos; so the will Of Jove appointed, and of all the Gods. There he espoused the daughter of the King Adrastus, occupied a mansion rich In all abundance; many a field possess'd Of wheat, well-planted gardens, numerous flocks, And was expert in spearmanship esteem'd Past all the Greecians. I esteem'd it right That ye should hear these things, for they are true. Ye will not, therefore, as I were obscure And of ignoble origin, reject What I shall well advise. Expedience bids That, wounded as we are, we join the host. We will preserve due distance from the range Of spears and arrows, lest already gall'd, We suffer worse; but we will others urge To combat, who have stood too long aloof, Attentive only to their own repose. He spake, whom all approved, and forth they went, Imperial Agamemnon at their head. Nor watch'd the glorious Shaker of the shores In vain, but like a man time-worn approach'd, And, seizing Agamemnon's better hand, In accents wing'd the monarch thus address'd. Atrides! now exults the vengeful heart Of fierce Achilles, viewing at his ease The flight and slaughter of Achaia's host; For he is mad, and let him perish such, And may his portion from the Gods be shame! But as for thee, not yet the powers of heaven Thee hate implacable; the Chiefs of Troy Shall cover yet with cloudy dust the breadth Of all the plain, and backward from the camp To Ilium's gates thyself shalt see them driven. He ceased, and shouting traversed swift the field. Loud as nine thousand or ten thousand shout In furious battle mingled, Neptune sent His voice abroad, force irresistible Infusing into every Greecian heart, And thirst of battle not to be assuaged. But Juno of the golden throne stood forth On the Olympian summit, viewing thence The field, where clear distinguishing the God Of ocean, her own brother, sole engaged Amid the glorious battle, glad was she. Seeing Jove also on the topmost point Of spring-fed Ida seated, she conceived Hatred against him, and thenceforth began Deliberate how best she might deceive The Thunderer, and thus at last resolved; Attired with skill celestial to descend On Ida, with a hope to allure him first Won by her beauty to a fond embrace, Then closing fast in balmy sleep profound His eyes, to elude his vigilance, secure. She sought her chamber; Vulcan her own son That chamber built. He framed the solid doors, And to the posts fast closed them with a key Mysterious, which, herself except, in heaven None understood. Entering she secured The splendid portal. First, she laved all o'er Her beauteous body with ambrosial lymph, Then polish'd it with richest oil divine Of boundless fragrance; oil that in the courts Eternal only shaken, through the skies Breathed odours, and through all the distant earth. Her whole fair body with those sweets bedew'd, She pass'd the comb through her ambrosial hair, And braided her bright locks streaming profuse From her immortal brows; with golden studs She made her gorgeous mantle fast before, Ethereal texture, labour of the hands Of Pallas beautified with various art, And braced it with a zone fringed all around An hundred fold; her pendants triple-gemm'd Luminous, graceful, in her ears she hung, And covering all her glories with a veil Sun-bright, new-woven, bound to her fair feet Her sandals elegant. Thus full attired, In all her ornaments, she issued forth, And beckoning Venus from the other powers Of heaven apart, the Goddess thus bespake. Daughter beloved! shall I obtain my suit, Or wilt thou thwart me, angry that I aid The Greecians, while thine aid is given to Troy? To whom Jove's daughter Venus thus replied. What would majestic Juno, daughter dread Of Saturn, sire of Jove? I feel a mind Disposed to gratify thee, if thou ask Things possible, and possible to me. Then thus with wiles veiling her deep design Imperial Juno. Give me those desires, That love-enkindling power by which thou sway'st Immortal hearts and mortal, all alike; For to the green earth's utmost bounds I go, To visit there the parent of the Gods, Oceanus, and Tethys his espoused, Mother of all. They kindly from the hands Of Rhea took, and with parental care Sustain'd and cherish'd me, what time from heaven The Thunderer hurl'd down Saturn, and beneath The earth fast bound him and the barren Deep. Them go I now to visit, and their feuds Innumerable to compose; for long They have from conjugal embrace abstain'd Through mutual wrath, whom by persuasive speech Might I restore into each other's arms, They would for ever love me and revere. Her, foam-born Venus then, Goddess of smiles, Thus answer'd. Thy request, who in the arms Of Jove reposest the omnipotent, Nor just it were nor seemly to refuse. So saying, the cincture from her breast she loosed Embroider'd, various, her all-charming zone. It was an ambush of sweet snares, replete With love, desire, soft intercourse of hearts, And music of resistless whisper'd sounds That from the wisest steal their best resolves; She placed it in her hands and thus she said. Take this,—this girdle fraught with every charm. Hide this within thy bosom, and return, Whate'er thy purpose, mistress of it all. She spake; imperial Juno smiled, and still Smiling complacent, bosom'd safe the zone. Then Venus to her father's court return'd, And Juno, starting from the Olympian height, O'erflew Pieria and the lovely plains Of broad Emathia; soaring thence she swept The snow-clad summits of the Thracian hills Steed-famed, nor printed, as she pass'd, the soil. From Athos o'er the foaming billows borne She came to Lemnos, city and abode Of noble Thoas, and there meeting Sleep, Brother of Death, she press'd his hand, and said, Sleep, over all, both Gods and men, supreme! If ever thou hast heard, hear also now My suit; I will be grateful evermore. Seal for me fast the radiant eyes of Jove In the instant of his gratified desire. Thy recompence shall be a throne of gold, Bright, incorruptible; my limping son, Vulcan, shall fashion it himself with art Laborious, and, beneath, shall place a stool For thy fair feet, at the convivial board. Then answer thus the tranquil Sleep return'd. Great Saturn's daughter, awe-inspiring Queen! All other of the everlasting Gods I could with ease make slumber, even the streams Of Ocean, Sire of all. Not so the King The son of Saturn; him, unless himself Give me command, I dare not lull to rest, Or even approach him, taught as I have been Already in the school of thy commands That wisdom. I forget not yet the day When, Troy laid waste, that valiant son Hercules. of his Sail'd homeward: then my influence I diffused Soft o'er the sovereign intellect of Jove; While thou, against the Hero plotting harm, Didst rouse the billows with tempestuous blasts, And separating him from all his friends, Brought'st him to populous Cos. Then Jove awoke, And, hurling in his wrath the Gods about, Sought chiefly me, whom far below all ken He had from heaven cast down into the Deep, But Night resistless vanquisher of all, Both Gods and men, preserved me; for to her I fled for refuge. So the Thunderer cool'd, Though sore displeased, and spared me through a fear To violate the peaceful sway of Night. And thou wouldst now embroil me yet again! To whom majestic Juno thus replied. Ah, wherefore, Sleep! should'st thou indulge a fear So groundless? Chase it from thy mind afar. Think'st thou the Thunderer as intent to serve The Trojans, and as jealous in their cause As erst for Hercules, his genuine son? Come then, and I will bless thee with a bride; One of the younger Graces shall be thine, Pasithea, day by day still thy desire. She spake; Sleep heard delighted, and replied. By the inviolable Stygian flood Swear to me; lay thy right hand on the glebe All-teeming, lay thy other on the face Of the flat sea, that all the Immortal Powers Who compass Saturn in the nether realms May witness, that thou givest me for a bride The younger Grace whom thou hast named, divine Pasithea, day by day still my desire. He said, nor beauteous Juno not complied, But sware, by name invoking all the powers Titanian call'd who in the lowest gulf Dwell under Tartarus, omitting none. Her oath with solemn ceremonial sworn, Together forth they went; Lemnos they left And Imbrus, city of Thrace, and in dark clouds Mantled, with gliding ease swam through the air To Ida's mount with rilling waters vein'd, Parent of savage beasts; at Lectos One of the heads of Ida. first They quitted Ocean, overpassing high The dry land, while beneath their feet the woods Their spiry summits waved. There, unperceived By Jove, Sleep mounted Ida's loftiest pine Of growth that pierced the sky, and hidden sat Secure by its expanded boughs, the bird Shrill-voiced resembling in the mountains seen, Chalcis in heaven, on earth Cymindis named But Juno swift to Gargarus the top Of Ida, soar'd, and there Jove saw his spouse. —Saw her—and in his breast the same love felt Rekindled vehement, which had of old Join'd them, when, by their parents unperceived, They stole aside, and snatch'd their first embrace. Soon he accosted her, and thus enquired. Juno! what region seeking hast thou left The Olympian summit, and hast here arrived With neither steed nor chariot in thy train? To whom majestic Juno thus replied Dissembling. To the green earth's end I go, To visit there the parent of the Gods Oceanus, and Tethys his espoused, Mother of all. They kindly from the hands Of Rhea took, and with parental care Sustain'd and cherish'd me; to them I haste Their feuds innumerable to compose, Who disunited by intestine strife Long time, from conjugal embrace abstain. My steeds, that lightly over dank and dry Shall bear me, at the rooted base I left Of Ida river-vein'd. But for thy sake From the Olympian summit I arrive, Lest journeying remote to the abode Of Ocean, and with no consent of thine Entreated first, I should, perchance, offend. To whom the cloud-assembler God replied. Juno! thy journey thither may be made Hereafter. Let us turn to dalliance now. For never Goddess pour'd, nor woman yet So full a tide of love into my breast; I never loved Ixion's consort thus Who bore Pirithoüs, wise as we in heaven; Nor sweet Acrisian Danäe, from whom Sprang Perseus, noblest of the race of man; Nor Phœnix' daughter fair Europa., of whom were born Minos unmatch'd but by the powers above, And Rhadamanthus; nor yet Semele, Nor yet Alcmena, who in Thebes produced The valiant Hercules; and though my son By Semele were Bacchus, joy of man; Nor Ceres golden-hair'd, nor high-enthroned Latona in the skies, no—nor thyself As now I love thee, and my soul perceive O'erwhelm'd with sweetness of intense desire. Then thus majestic Juno her reply Framed artful. Oh unreasonable haste! What speaks the Thunderer? If on Ida's heights Where all is open and to view exposed Thou wilt that we embrace, what must betide, Should any of the everlasting Gods Observe us, and declare it to the rest? Never could I, arising, seek again Thy mansion, so unseemly were the deed. But if thy inclinations that way tend, Thou hast a chamber; it is Vulcan's work, Our son's; he framed and fitted to its posts The solid portal; thither let us hie, And there repose, since such thy pleasure seems. To whom the cloud-assembler Deity. Fear thou not, Juno, lest the eye of Man Or of a God discern us; at my word A golden cloud shall fold us so around, That not the Sun himself shall through that veil Discover aught, though keenest-eyed of all. So spake the son of Saturn, and his spouse Fast lock'd within his arms. Beneath them earth With sudden herbage teem'd; at once upsprang The crocus soft, the lotus bathed in dew, And the crisp hyacinth with clustering bells; Thick was their growth, and high above the ground Upbore them. On that flowery couch they lay, Invested with a golden cloud that shed Bright dew-drops all around. His heart at ease, There lay the Sire of all, by sleep and love Vanquish'd on lofty Gargarus, his spouse Constraining still with amorous embrace. Then, gentle Sleep to the Achaian camp Sped swift away, with tidings for the ear Of earth-encircler Neptune charged; him soon He found, and in wing'd accents thus began. Now Neptune, yield the Greeks effectual aid, And, while the moment lasts of Jove's repose, Make victory theirs; for him in slumbers soft I have involved, while Juno by deceit Prevailing, lured him with the bait of love. He said, and swift departed to his task Among the nations; but his tidings urged Neptune with still more ardour to assist The Danaï; he leap'd into the van Afar, and thus exhorted them aloud. Oh Argives! yield we yet again the day To Priameian Hector? Shall he seize Our ships, and make the glory all his own? Such is his expectation, so he vaunts, For that Achilles leaves not yet his camp, Resentful; but of him small need, I judge, Should here be felt, could once the rest be roused To mutual aid. Act, then, as I advise. The best and broadest bucklers of the host, And brightest helmets put we on, and arm'd With longest spears, advance; myself will lead; And trust me, furious though he be, the son Of Priam flies. Ye then who feel your hearts Undaunted, but are arm'd with smaller shields, Them give to those who fear, and in exchange Their stronger shields and broader take yourselves. So he, whom, unreluctant, all obey'd. Then, wounded as they were, themselves the Kings, Tydides, Agamemnon and Ulysses Marshall'd the warriors, and from rank to rank Made just exchange of arms, giving the best To the best warriors, to the worse, the worst. And now in brazen armour all array'd Refulgent, on they moved, by Neptune led With firm hand grasping his long-bladed sword Keen as Jove's bolt; with Him may none contend In dreadful fight; but fear chains every arm. Opposite, Priameian Hector ranged His Trojans; then they stretch'd the bloody cord Of conflict tight, Neptune cœrulean-hair'd, And Hector, pride of Ilium; one, the Greeks Supporting firm, and one, the powers of Troy; A sea-flood dash'd the galleys, and the hosts Join'd clamorous. Not so the billows roar The shores among, when Boreas' roughest blast Sweeps landward from the main the towering surge; Not so, devouring fire among the trees That clothe the mountain, when the sheeted flames Ascending wrap the forest in a blaze; Nor howl the winds through leafy boughs of oaks Upgrown aloft, (though loudest there they rave,) With sounds so aweful as were heard of Greeks And Trojans shouting when the clash began. At Ajax, first, (for face to face they stood,) Illustrious Hector threw a spear well-aim'd, But smote him where the belts that bore his shield And faulchion cross'd each other on his breast. The double guard preserved him unannoy'd. Indignant that his spear had bootless flown, Yet fearing death at hand, the Trojan Chief Toward the phalanx of his friends retired. But, as he went, huge Ajax with a stone Of those which propp'd the ships, (for numerous such Lay rolling at the feet of those who fought,) Assail'd him. Twirling like a top it pass'd The shield of Hector, near the neck his breast Struck full, then plough'd circuitous the dust. As when Jove's arm omnipotent an oak Prostrates uprooted on the plain, a fume Rises sulphureous from the riven trunk, And if, perchance, some traveller nigh at hand See it, he trembles at the bolt of Jove, So fell the might of Hector, to the earth Smitten at once. Down dropp'd his idle spear, And with his helmet and his shield himself Also; loud thunder'd all his gorgeous arms. Swift flew the Greecians shouting to the skies, And showering darts, to drag his body thence, But neither spear of theirs nor shaft could harm The fallen leader, with such instant aid His princely friends encircled him around, Sarpedon, Lycian Chief, Glaucus the brave, Polydamas, Æneas, and renown'd Agenor; neither tardy were the rest, But with round shields all shelter'd Hector fallen. Him soon uplifted from the plain his friends Bore thence, till where his fiery coursers stood, And splendid chariot in the rear, they came, Then Troy-ward drove him groaning as he went. Ere long arriving at the pleasant stream Of eddied Xanthus, progeny of Jove, They lay'd him on the bank, and on his face Pour'd water; he, reviving, upward gazed, And seated on his hams black blood disgorged Coagulate, but soon relapsing, fell Supine, his eyes with pitchy darkness veil'd, And all his powers still torpid by the blow. Then, seeing Hector borne away, the Greeks Rush'd fiercer on, all mindful of the fight, And far before the rest, Ajax the swift, The Oïlean Chief, with pointed spear On Satnius springing, pierced him. Him a nymph A Naiad, bore to Enops, while his herd Feeding, on Satnio's grassy verge he stray'd. But Oïliades the spear-renown'd Approaching, pierced his flank; supine he fell, And fiery contest for the dead arose. In vengeance of his fall, spear-shaking Chief The son of Panthus into fight advanced Polydamas, who Prothöenor pierced Offspring of Areïlocus, and urged Through his right shoulder sheer the stormy lance. He, prostrate, clench'd the dust, and with loud voice Polydamas exulted at his fall. Yon spear, methinks, hurl'd from the warlike hand Of Panthus' noble son, flew not in vain, But some Greek hath it, purposing, I judge, To lean on it in his descent to hell. So he, whose vaunt the Greeks indignant heard, But most indignant, Ajax, offspring bold Of Telamon, to whom he nearest fell. He, quick, at the retiring conqueror cast His radiant spear; Polydamas the stroke Shunn'd, starting sideward; but Antenor's son Archilochus the mortal dint received, Death-destined by the Gods; where neck and spine Unite, both tendons he dissever'd wide, And, ere his knees, his nostrils met the ground. Then Ajax in his turn vaunting aloud Against renown'd Polydamas, exclaim'd. Speak now the truth, Polydamas, and weigh My question well. His life whom I have slain Makes it not compensation for the loss Of Prothöenor's life? To me he seems Nor base himself, nor yet of base descent, But brother of Antenor steed-renown'd, Or else perchance his son; for in my eyes Antenor's lineage he resembles most. So he, well knowing him, and sorrow seized Each Trojan heart. Then Acamas around His brother stalking, wounded with his spear Bœotian Promachus, who by the feet Dragg'd off the slain. Acamas in his fall Aloud exulted with a boundless joy. Vain-glorious Argives, archers inexpert! War's toil and trouble are not ours alone, But ye shall perish also; mark the man,— How sound he sleeps tamed by my conquering arm, Your fellow-warrior Promachus! the debt Of vengeance on my brother's dear behalf Demanded quick discharge; well may the wish Of every dying warrior be to leave A brother living to avenge his fall. He ended, whom the Greeks indignant heard, But chiefly brave Peneleus; swift he rush'd On Acamas; but from before the force Of King Peneleus Acamas retired, And, in his stead, Ilioneus he pierced, Offspring of Phorbas, rich in flocks, and blest By Mercury with such abundant wealth As other Trojan none, nor child to him His spouse had borne, Ilioneus except. Him close beneath the brow to his eye-roots Piercing, he push'd the pupil from its seat, And through his eye and through his poll the spear Urged furious. He down-sitting on the earth Both hands extended; but, his glittering blade Forth-drawn, Peneleus through his middle neck Enforced it; head and helmet to the ground He lopp'd together, with the lance infixt Still in his eye; then like a poppy's head The crimson trophy lifting, in the ears He vaunted loud of Ilium's host, and cried. Go, Trojans! be my messengers! Inform The parents of Ilioneus the brave That they may mourn their son through all their house, For so the wife of Alegenor's son Bœotian Promachus must him bewail, Nor shall she welcome his return with smiles Of joy affectionate, when from the shores Of Troy the fleet shall bear us Greecians home. He said; fear whiten'd every Trojan cheek, And every Trojan eye with earnest look Enquired a refuge from impending fate. Say now, ye Muses, blest inhabitants Of the Olympian realms! what Greecian first Fill'd his victorious hand with armour stript From slaughter'd Trojans, after Ocean's God Had, interposing, changed the battle's course? First, Telamonian Ajax Hyrtius slew, Undaunted leader of the Mysian band. Phalces and Mermerus their arms resign'd To young Antilochus; Hyppotion fell And Morys by Meriones; the shafts Right-aim'd of Teucer to the shades dismiss'd Prothöus and Periphetes, and the prince Of Sparta, Menelaus, in his flank Pierced Hyperenor; on his entrails prey'd The hungry steel, and, through the gaping wound Expell'd, his spirit flew; night veil'd his eyes. But Ajax Oïliades the swift Slew most; him none could equal in pursuit Of tremblers scatter'd by the frown of Jove. BOOK XV. ARGUMENT OF THE FIFTEENTH BOOK. Jove, awaking and seeing the Trojans routed, threatens Juno. He sends Iris to admonish Neptune to relinquish the battle, and Apollo to restore health to Hector. Apollo armed with the Ægis, puts to flight the Greecians; they are pursued home to their fleet, and Telamonian Ajax slays twelve Trojans bringing fire to burn it. But when the flying Trojans had o'erpass'd Both stakes and trench, and numerous slaughter'd lay By Greecian hands, the remnant halted all Beside their chariots, pale, discomfited. Then was it that on Ida's summit Jove At Juno's side awoke; starting, he stood At once erect; Trojans and Greeks he saw, These broken, those pursuing and led on By Neptune; he beheld also remote Encircled by his friends, and on the plain Extended, Hector; there he panting lay, Senseless, ejecting blood, bruised by a blow From not the feeblest of the sons of Greece. Touch'd with compassion at that sight, the Sire Of Gods and men, frowning terrific, fix'd His eyes on Juno, and her thus bespake. No place for doubt remains. Oh, versed in wiles, Juno! thy mischief-teeming mind perverse Hath plotted this; thou hast contrived the hurt Of Hector, and hast driven his host to flight. I know not but thyself may'st chance to reap The first-fruits of thy cunning, scourged The Translator seizes the opportunity afforded to him by this remarkable passage, to assure his readers, who are not readers of the original, that the discipline which Juno is here said to have suffered from the hands of Jove, is not of his own invention. He found it in the original, and considering fidelity as his indispensable duty, has not attempted to soften or to refine away the matter. He begs that this observation may be adverted to as often as any passage shall occur, in which ancient practices or customs, not consonant to our own, either in point of delicacy or humanity, may be either expressed or alluded to. He makes this request the rather, because on these occasions Mr. Pope has observed a different conduct, suppressing all such images as he had reason to suppose might be offensive. by me. Hast thou forgotten how I once aloft Suspended thee, with anvils at thy feet, And both thy wrists bound with a golden cord Indissoluble? In the clouds of heaven I hung thee, while from the Olympian heights The Gods look'd mournful on, but of them all None could deliver thee, for whom I seized, Hurl'd through the gates of heaven on earth he fell, Half-breathless. Neither so did I resign My hot resentment of the Hero's wrongs Immortal Hercules, whom thou by storms Call'd from the North, with mischievous intent Hadst driven far distant o'er the barren Deep To populous Cos. Thence I deliver'd him, And after numerous woes severe, he reach'd The shores of fruitful Argos, saved by me. I thus remind thee now, that thou may'st cease Henceforth from artifice, and may'st be taught How little all the dalliance and the love Which, stealing down from heaven, thou hast by fraud Obtain'd from me, shall profit thee at last. He ended, whom imperial Juno heard Shuddering, and in wing'd accents thus replied. Be witness Earth, the boundless Heaven above, And Styx beneath, whose stream the blessed Gods Even tremble to adjure; be witness too Thy sacred life, and our connubial bed, Which by a false oath I will never wrong, That by no art induced or plot of mine Neptune, the shaker of the shores, inflicts These harms on Hector and the Trojan host Aiding the Greecians, but impell'd alone By his own heart with pity moved at sight Of the Achaians at the ships subdued. But even Him, oh sovereign of the storms! I am prepared to admonish that he quit The battle, and retire where thou command'st. So she; then smiled the Sire of Gods and men, And in wing'd accents answer thus return'd. Juno! wouldst thou on thy celestial throne Assist my counsels, howsoe'er in heart He differ now, Neptune should soon his will Submissive bend to thy desires and mine. But if sincerity be in thy words And truth, repairing to the blest abodes Send Iris hither, with the archer God Apollo; that she, visiting the host Of Greece, may bid the Sovereign of the Deep Renounce the fight, and seek his proper home. Apollo's part shall be to rouse again Hector to battle, to inspire his soul Afresh with courage, and all memory thence To banish of the pangs which now he feels. Apollo also shall again repulse Achaia's host, which with base panic fill'd, Shall even to Achilles' ships be driven. Achilles shall his valiant friend exhort Patroclus forth; him under Ilium's walls Shall glorious Hector slay; but many a youth Shall perish by Patroclus first, with whom, My noble son Sarpedon. Peleus' son, Resentful of Patroclus' death, shall slay Hector, and I will urge ceaseless, myself, Thenceforth the routed Trojans back again, Till by Minerva's aid the Greeks shall take Ilium's proud city; till that day arrive My wrath shall burn, nor will I one permit Of all the Immortals to assist the Greeks, But will perform Achilles' whole desire. Such was my promise to him at the first, Ratified by a nod that self-same day When Thetis clasp'd my knees, begging revenge And glory for her city-spoiler son. He ended; nor his spouse white-arm'd refused Obedience, but from the Idæan heights Departing, to the Olympian summit soar'd. Swift as the traveller's thought, who, many a land Traversed, deliberates on his future course Uncertain, and his mind sends every way, So swift updarted Juno to the skies. Arrived on the Olympian heights, she found The Gods assembled; they, at once, their seats At her approach forsaking, with full cups Her coming hail'd; heedless of all beside, She took the cup from blooming Themis' hand, For she first flew to welcome her, and thus In accents wing'd of her return enquired. Say, Juno, why this sudden re-ascent? Thou seem'st dismay'd; hath Saturn's son, thy spouse, Driven thee affrighted to the skies again? To whom the white-arm'd Goddess thus replied. Themis divine, ask not. Full well thou know'st How harshly temper'd is the mind of Jove, And how untractable. Resume thy seat; The banquet calls thee; at our board preside. Thou shalt be told, and all in heaven shall hear What ills he threatens; such as shall not leave All minds at ease, I judge, here or on earth, However tranquil some and joyous now. So spake the aweful spouse of Jove, and sat. Then, all alike, the Gods displeasure felt Throughout the courts of Jove, but she, her lips Gracing with smiles from which her sable brows Dissented, thus, indignant them address'd. Alas! how vain against the Thunderer's will Our anger, and the hope to supersede His purpose, by persuasion or by force! He solitary sits, all unconcern'd At our resentment, and himself proclaims Mightiest and most to be revered in heaven. Be patient, therefore, and let each endure Such ills as Jove may send him. Mars, I ween, Already hath his share; the warrior God Hath lost Ascalaphus, of all mankind His most beloved, and whom he calls his own. She spake, and with expanded palms his thighs Smiting, thus, sorrowful, the God exclaim'd. Inhabitants of the Olympian heights! Oh bear with me, if to avenge my son I seek Achaia's fleet, although my doom Be thunder-bolts from Jove, and with the dead Outstretch'd to lie in carnage and in dust. He spake, and bidding Horror and Dismay Lead to the yoke his rapid steeds, put on His all-refulgent armour. Then had wrath More dreadful, some strange vengeance on the Gods From Jove befallen, had not Minerva, touch'd With timely fears for all, upstarting sprung From where she sat, right through the vestibule. She snatch'd the helmet from his brows, the shield From his broad shoulder, and the brazen spear Forced from his grasp into its place restored. Then reprimanding Mars, she thus began. Frantic, delirious! thou art lost for ever! Is it in vain that thou hast ears to ear, And hast thou neither shame nor reason left? How? hear'st thou not the Goddess? the report Of white-arm'd Juno from Olympian Jove Return'd this moment? or preferr'st thou rather, Plagued with a thousand woes, and under force Of sad necessity to seek again Olympus, and at thy return to prove Author of countless miseries to us all? For He at once Greecians and Trojans both Abandoning, will hither haste prepared To tempest To tempest—??????????—Milton uses tempest as a verb. Speaking of the fishes, he says ? part, huge of bulk Wallowing unwieldy, enormous in their gait, Tempest the ocean. us in heaven, whom he will seize, The guilty and the guiltless, all alike. I bid thee, therefore, patient bear the death Of thy Ascalaphus; braver than he And abler have, ere now, in battle fallen, And shall hereafter; arduous were the task To rescue from the stroke of fate, the race Of mortal men, with all their progeny. So saying, Minerva on his throne replaced The fiery Mars. Then, summoning abroad Apollo from within the hall of Jove, With Iris, swift embassadress of heaven, Them in wing'd accents Juno thus bespake. Jove bids you hence with undelaying speed To Ida; in his presence once arrived, See that ye execute his whole command. So saying, the aweful Goddess to her throne Return'd and sat. They, cleaving swift the air, Alighted soon on Ida fountain-fed, Parent of savage kinds. High on the point Seated of Gargarus, and wrapt around With fragrant clouds, they found Saturnian Jove The Thunderer, and in his presence stood. He, nought displeased that they his high command Had with such readiness obey'd, his speech To Iris, first, in accents wing'd address'd. Swift Iris, haste—to royal Neptune bear My charge entire; falsify not the word. Bid him, relinquishing the fight, withdraw Either to heaven, or to the boundless Deep. But should he disobedient prove, and scorn My message, let him, next, consider well How he will bear, powerful as he is, My coming. Me I boast superior far In force, and elder-born; yet deems he slight The danger of comparison with me, Who am the terror of all heaven beside. He spake, nor storm-wing'd Iris disobey'd, But down from the Idæan summit stoop'd To sacred Ilium. As when snow or hail Flies drifted by the cloud-dispelling North, So swiftly, wing'd with readiness of will, She shot the gulf between, and standing soon At glorious Neptune's side, him thus address'd. To thee, O Neptune azure-hair'd! I come With tidings charged from Ægis-bearing Jove. He bids thee cease from battle, and retire Either to heaven, or to the boundless Deep. But shouldst thou, disobedient, set at nought His words, he threatens that himself will haste To fight against thee; but he bids thee shun That strife with one superior far to thee, And elder-born; yet deem'st thou slight, he saith, The danger of comparison with Him, Although the terror of all heaven beside. Her then the mighty shaker of the shores Answer'd indignant. Great as is his power, Yet he hath spoken proudly, threatening me With force, high-born and glorious as himself. We are three brothers; Saturn is our sire, And Rhea brought us forth; first, Jove she bore; Me next; then, Pluto, sovereign of the shades. By distribution tripart we received Each his peculiar honours; me the lots Made Ruler of the hoary floods, and there I dwell for ever. Pluto, for his part, The regions took of darkness; and the heavens, The clouds, and boundless æther, fell to Jove. The Earth and the Olympian heights alike Are common to the three. My life and being I hold not, therefore, at his will, whose best And safest course, with all his boasted power, Were to possess in peace his proper Third. Let him not seek to terrify with force Me like a dastard; let him rather chide His own-begotten; with big-sounding words His sons and daughters govern, who perforce Obey his voice, and shrink at his commands. To whom thus Iris tempest-wing'd replied. Cœrulean-tress'd Sovereign of the Deep! Shall I report to Jove, harsh as it is, Thy speech, or wilt thou soften it? The wise Are flexible, and on the Elder-born Erynnis, with her vengeful sisters, waits. Her answer'd then the Shaker of the shores. Prudent is thy advice, Iris divine! Discretion in a messenger is good At all times. But the cause that fires me thus, And with resentment my whole heart and mind Possesses, is the license that he claims To vex with provocation rude of speech Me his compeer, and by decree of Fate Illustrious as himself; yet, though incensed, And with just cause, I will not now persist. But hear—for it is treasured in my heart The threat that my lips utter. If he still Resolve to spare proud Ilium in despight Of me, of Pallas, Goddess of the spoils, Of Juno, Mercury, and the King of fire, And will not overturn her lofty towers, Nor grant immortal glory to the Greeks, Then tell him thus—Hostility shall burn, And wrath between us never to be quench'd. So saying, the Shaker of the shores forsook The Greecian host, and plunged into the Deep, Miss'd by Achaia's heroes. Then, the cloud- Assembler God thus to Apollo spake. Hence, my Apollo! to the Trojan Chief Hector; for earth-encircler Neptune, awed By fear of my displeasure imminent, Hath sought the sacred Deep. Else, all the Gods Who compass Saturn in the nether realms, Had even there our contest heard, I ween, And heard it loudly. But that he retreats Although at first incensed, shunning my wrath, Is salutary both for him and me, Whose difference else had not been heal'd with ease. Take thou my shaggy Ægis, and with force Smiting it, terrify the Chiefs of Greece. As for illustrious Hector, him I give To thy peculiar care; fail not to rouse His fiercest courage, till he push the Greeks To Hellespont, and to their ships again; Thenceforth to yield to their afflicted host Some pause from toil, shall be my own concern. He ended, nor Apollo disobey'd His father's voice; from the Idæan heights, Swift as the swiftest of the fowls of air, The dove-destroyer falcon, down he flew. The noble Hector, valiant Priam's son He found, not now extended on the plain, But seated; newly, as from death, awaked, And conscious of his friends; freely he breathed Nor sweated more, by Jove himself revived. Apollo stood beside him, and began. Say, Hector, Priam's son! why sittest here Feeble and spiritless, and from thy host Apart? what new disaster hath befall'n? To whom with difficulty thus replied The warlike Chief.—But tell me who art Thou, Divine enquirer! best of powers above! Know'st not that dauntless Ajax me his friends Slaughtering at yonder ships, hath with a stone Surceased from fight, smiting me on the breast? I thought to have beheld, this day, the dead In Ades, every breath so seem'd my last. Then answer thus the Archer God return'd. Courage this moment! such an helper Jove From Ida sends thee at thy side to war Continual, Phœbus of the golden sword, Whose guardian aid both thee and lofty Troy Hath succour'd many a time. Therefore arise! Instant bid drive thy numerous charioteers Their rapid steeds full on the Greecian fleet; I, marching at their head, will smooth, myself, The way before them, and will turn again To flight the Heroes of the host of Greece. He said and with new strength the Chief inspired. As some stall'd horse high-pamper'd, snapping short His cord, beats under foot the sounding soil, Accustom'd in smooth-sliding streams to lave Exulting; high he bears his head, his mane Wantons around his shoulders; pleased, he eyes His glossy sides, and borne on pliant keees Soon finds the haunts where all his fellows graze; So bounded Hector, and his agile joints Plied lightly, quicken'd by the voice divine, And gather'd fast his charioteers to battle. But as when hounds and hunters through the woods Rush in pursuit of stag or of wild goat, He, in some cave with tangled boughs o'erhung, Lies safe conceal'd, no destined prey of theirs, Till by their clamours roused, a lion grim Starts forth to meet them; then, the boldest fly; Such hot pursuit the Danaï, with swords And spears of double edge long time maintain'd, But seeing Hector in his ranks again Occupied, felt at once their courage fall'n. Then, Thoas them, Andræmon's son, address'd, Foremost of the Ætolians, at the spear Skilful, in stationary combat bold, And when the sons of Greece held in dispute The prize of eloquence, excell'd by few. Prudent advising them, he thus began. Ye Gods! what prodigy do I behold? Hath Hector, 'scaping death, risen again? For him, with confident persuasion all Believed by Telamonian Ajax slain. But some Divinity hath interposed To rescue and save Hector, who the joints Hath stiffen'd of full many a valiant Greek, As surely now he shall; for, not without The Thunderer's aid, he flames in front again. But take ye all my counsel. Send we back The multitude into the fleet, and first Let us, who boast ourselves bravest in fight, Stand, that encountering him with lifted spears, We may attempt to give his rage a check. To thrust himself into a band like ours Will, doubtless, even in Hector move a fear. He ceased, with whose advice all, glad, complied. Then Ajax with Idomeneus of Crete. Teucer, Meriones, and Meges fierce As Mars in battle, summoning aloud The noblest Greeks, in opposition firm To Hector and his host their bands prepared, While others all into the fleet retired. Troy's crowded host ????? ?? ????????? ???????. The translation is literal, and affords one of many instances in which the Greek and English idiom correspond exactly. struck first. With aweful strides Came Hector foremost; him Apollo led, His shoulders wrapt in clouds, and, on his arm, The Ægis shagg'd terrific all around, Tempestuous, dazzling-bright; it was a gift To Jove from Vulcan, and design'd to appall, And drive to flight the armies of the earth. Arm'd with that shield Apollo led them on. Firm stood the embodied Greeks; from either host Shrill cries arose; the arrows from the nerve Leap'd, and, by vigorous arms dismiss'd, the spears Flew frequent; in the flesh some stood infixt Of warlike youths, but many, ere they reach'd The mark they coveted, unsated fell Between the hosts, and rested in the soil. Long as the God unagitated held The dreadful disk, so long the vollied darts Made mutual slaughter, and the people fell; But when he look'd the Greecian charioteers Full in the face and shook it, raising high Himself the shout of battle, then he quell'd Their spirits, then he struck from every mind At once all memory of their might in arms. As when two lions in the still dark night An herd of beeves scatter or numerous flock Suddenly, in the absence of the guard, So fled the heartless Greeks, for Phœbus sent Terrours among them, but renown conferr'd And triumph proud on Hector and his host. Then, in that foul disorder of the field, Man singled man. Arcesilaüs died By Hector's arm, and Stichius; one, a Chief Arcesilaus. Of the Bœotians brazen-mail'd, and one, Menestheus' faithful follower to the fight. Æneas Medon and Iäsus slew. Medon was spurious offspring of divine Oïleus Ajax' father, and abode In Phylace; for he had slain a Chief Brother of Eriopis the espoused Of brave Oïleus; but Iäsus led A phalanx of Athenians, and the son Of Sphelus, son of Bucolus was deem'd. Pierced by Polydamas Mecisteus fell. Polites, in the van of battle, slew Echion, and Agenor Clonius; But Paris, while Deïochus to flight Turn'd with the routed van, pierced him beneath His shoulder-blade, and urged the weapon through. While them the Trojans spoil'd, meantime the Greeks, Entangled in the piles of the deep foss, Fled every way, and through necessity Repass'd the wall. Then Hector with a voice Of loud command bade every Trojan cease From spoil, and rush impetuous on the fleet. This abruptness of transition from the third person to the first, follows the original.And whom I find far lingering from the ships Wherever, there he dies; no funeral fires Brother on him, or sister, shall bestow, But dogs shall rend him in the sight of Troy. So saying, he lash'd the shoulders of his steeds, And through the ranks vociferating, call'd His Trojans on; they, clamorous as he, All lash'd their steeds, and menacing, advanced. Before them with his feet Apollo push'd The banks into the foss, bridging the gulf With pass commodious, both in length and breadth A lance's flight, for proof of vigour hurl'd. There, phalanx after phalanx, they their host Pour'd dense along, while Phœbus in the van Display'd the awful ægis, and the wall Levell'd with ease divine. As, on the shore Some wanton boy with sand builds plaything walls, Then, sportive, spreads them with his feet abroad, So thou, shaft-arm'd Apollo! that huge work Laborious of the Greeks didst turn with ease To ruin, and themselves drovest all to flight. They, thus enforced into the fleet, again Stood fast, with mutual exhortation each His friend encouraging, and all the Gods With lifted hands soliciting aloud. But, more than all, Gerenian Nestor pray'd Fervent, Achaia's guardian, and with arms Outstretch'd toward the starry skies, exclaim'd. Jove, Father! if in corn-clad Argos, one, One Greek hath ever, burning at thy shrine Fat thighs of sheep or oxen, ask'd from thee A safe return, whom thou hast gracious heard, Olympian King! and promised what he sought, Now, in remembrance of it, give us help In this disastrous day, nor thus permit Their Trojan foes to tread the Greecians down! So Nestor pray'd, and Jove thunder'd aloud Responsive to the old Neleïan's prayer. But when that voice of ægis-bearing Jove The Trojans heard, more furious on the Greeks They sprang, all mindful of the fight. As when A turgid billow of some spacious sea, While the wind blows that heaves its highest, borne Sheer o'er the vessel's side, rolls into her, With such loud roar the Trojans pass'd the wall; In rush'd the steeds, and at the ships they waged Fierce battle hand to hand, from chariots, these, With spears of double edge, those, from the decks Of many a sable bark, with naval poles Long, ponderous, shod with steel; for every ship Had such, for conflict maritime prepared. While yet the battle raged only without The wall, and from the ships apart, so long Patroclus quiet in the tent and calm Sat of Eurypylus, his generous friend Consoling with sweet converse, and his wound Sprinkling with drugs assuasive of his pains. But soon as through the broken rampart borne He saw the Trojans, and the clamour heard And tumult of the flying Greeks, a voice Of loud lament uttering, with open palms His thighs he smote, and, sorrowful, exclaim'd. Eurypylus! although thy need be great, No longer may I now sit at thy side, Such contest hath arisen; thy servant's voice Must sooth thee now, for I will to the tent Haste of Achilles, and exhort him forth; Who knows? if such the pleasure of the Gods, I may prevail; friends rarely plead in vain. So saying, he went. Meantime the Greeks endured The Trojan onset, firm, yet from the ships Repulsed them not, though fewer than themselves, Nor could the host of Troy, breaking the ranks Of Greece, mix either with the camp or fleet; But as the line divides the plank aright, Stretch'd by some naval architect, whose hand Minerva hath accomplish'd in his art, So stretch'd on them the cord of battle lay. Others at other ships the conflict waged, But Hector to the ship advanced direct Of glorious Ajax; for one ship they strove; Nor Hector, him dislodging thence, could fire The fleet, nor Ajax from the fleet repulse Hector, conducted thither by the Gods. Then, noble Ajax with a spear the breast Pierced of Caletor, son of Clytius, arm'd With fire to burn his bark; sounding he fell, And from his loosen'd grasp down dropp'd the brand. But Hector seeing his own kinsman fallen Beneath the sable bark, with mighty voice Call'd on the hosts of Lycia and of Troy. Trojans and Lycians, and close-fighting sons Of Dardanus, within this narrow pass Stand firm, retreat not, but redeem the son Of Clytius, lest the Greecians of his arms Despoil him slain in battle at the ships. So saying, at Ajax his bright spear he cast. Him pierced he not, but Lycophron the son Of Mastor, a Cytherian, who had left Cytheræ, fugitive for blood, and dwelt With Ajax. Him standing at Ajax' side, He pierced above his ear; down from the stern Supine he fell, and in the dust expired. Then, shuddering, Ajax to his brother spake. Alas, my Teucer! we have lost our friend; Mastorides is slain, whom we received An inmate from Cytheræ, and with love And reverence even filial, entertain'd; By Hector pierced, he dies. Where are thy shafts Death-wing'd, and bow, by gift from Phœbus thine? He said, whom Teucer hearing, instant ran With bow and well-stored quiver to his side, Whence soon his arrows sought the Trojan host. He struck Pisenor's son Clytus, the friend And charioteer of brave Polydamas, Offspring of Panthus, toiling with both hands To rule his fiery steeds; for more to please The Trojans and their Chief, where stormy most He saw the battle, thither he had driven. But sudden mischief, valiant as he was, Found him, and such as none could waft aside, For right into his neck the arrow plunged, And down he fell; his startled coursers shook Their trappings, and the empty chariot rang. That sound alarm'd Polydamas; he turn'd, And flying to their heads, consign'd them o'er To Protiaön's son, Astynoüs, Whom he enjoin'd to keep them in his view, Then, turning, mingled with the van again. But Teucer still another shaft produced Design'd for valiant Hector, whose exploits (Had that shaft reach'd him) at the ships of Greece Had ceased for ever. But the eye of Jove, Guardian of Hector's life, slept not; he took From Telamonian Teucer that renown, And while he stood straining the twisted nerve Against the Trojan, snapp'd it. Devious flew The steel-charged The Translator hopes that his learned readers will pardon him, if sometimes, to avoid an irksome cacophony, he turns brass into steel. In fact, the arrow had not a point of steel, but a brazen one. arrow, and he dropp'd his bow. Then, shuddering, to his brother thus he spake. Ah! it is evident. Some Power divine Makes fruitless all our efforts, who hath struck My bow out of my hand, and snapt the cord With which I strung it new at dawn of day, That it might bear the bound of many a shaft. To whom the towering son of Telamon. Leave then thy bow, and let thine arrows rest, Which, envious of the Greeks, some God confounds, That thou may'st fight with spear and buckler arm'd, And animate the rest. Such be our deeds That, should they conquer us, our foes may find Our ships, at least a prize not lightly won. So Ajax spake; then Teucer, in his tent The bow replacing, slung his fourfold shield, Settled on his illustrious brows his casque With hair high-crested, waving, as he moved, Terrible from above, took forth a spear Tough-grain'd, acuminated sharp with brass, And stood, incontinent, at Ajax' side. Hector perceived the change, and of the cause Conscious, with echoing voice call'd to his host. Trojans and Lycians and close-fighting sons Of Dardanus, oh now, my friends, be men, Now, wheresoever through the fleet dispersed, Call into mind the fury of your might! For I have seen, myself, Jove rendering vain The arrows of their mightiest. Man may know With ease the hand of interposing Jove, Both whom to glory he ordains, and whom He weakens and aids not; so now he leaves The Greecians, but propitious smiles on us. Therefore stand fast, and whosoever gall'd By arrow or by spear, dies—Let him die; It shall not shame him that he died to serve His country, but his children, wife and home, With all his heritage, shall be secure, Drive but the Greecians from the shores of Troy. So saying, he animated each. Meantime, Ajax his fellow-warriors thus address'd. Shame on you all! Now, Greecians, either die, Or save at once your galley and yourselves. Hope ye, that should your ships become the prize Of warlike Hector, ye shall yet return On foot? Or hear ye not the Chief aloud Summoning all his host, and publishing His own heart's wish to burn your fleet with fire? Not to a dance, believe me, but to fight He calls them; therefore wiser course for us Is none, than that we mingle hands with hands In contest obstinate, and force with force. Better at once to perish, or at once To rescue life, than to consume the time Hour after hour in lingering conflict vain Here at the ships, with an inferior foe. He said, and by his words into all hearts Fresh confidence infused. Then Hector smote Schedius, a Chief of the Phocensian powers And son of Perimedes; Ajax slew, Meantime, a Chief of Trojan infantry, Laodamas, Antenor's noble son, While by Polydamas, a leader bold Of the Epeans, and Phylides' Meges. friend, Cyllenian Otus died. Meges that sight Viewing indignant on the conqueror sprang, But, starting wide, Polydamas escaped, Saved by Apollo, and his spear transpierced The breast of Cræsmus; on his sounding shield Prostrate he fell, and Meges stripp'd his arms. Him so employ'd Dolops assail'd, brave son Of Lampus, best of men and bold in fight, Offspring of King Laomedon; he stood Full near, and through his middle buckler struck The son of Phyleus, but his corslet thick With plates of scaly brass his life secured. That corslet Phyleus on a time brought home From Ephyre, where the Selleïs winds, And it was given him for his life's defence In furious battle by the King of men, Euphetes. Many a time had it preserved Unharm'd the sire, and now it saved the son. Then Meges, rising, with his pointed lance The bushy crest of Dolops' helmet drove Sheer from its base; new tinged with purple bright Entire it fell and mingled with the dust. While thus they strove, each hoping victory, Came martial Menelaus to the aid Of Meges; spear in hand apart he stood By Dolops unperceived, through his back drove And through his breast the spear, and far beyond, And down fell Dolops, forehead to the ground. At once both flew to strip his radiant arms. Then, Hector summoning his kindred, call'd Each to his aid, and Melanippus first, Illustrious Hicetaon's son, reproved. Ere yet the enemies of Troy arrived He in Percote fed his wandering beeves, But when the Danaï with all their fleet Came thither, then returning, he outshone The noblest Trojans, and at Priam's side Dwelling, was honour'd by him as a son. Him Hector reprimanding, stern began. Are we thus slack? Can Melanippus view Unmoved a kinsman slain? Seest not the Greeks How busy there with Dolops and his arms? Come on. It is no time for distant war, But either our Achaian foes must bleed, Or Ilium taken, from her topmost height Must stoop, and all her citizens be slain. So saying he went, whose steps the godlike Chief Attended, and the Telamonian, next, Huge Ajax, animated thus the Greeks. Oh friends, be men! Deep treasure in your hearts An honest shame, and, fighting bravely, fear Each to incur the censure of the rest. Of men so minded more survive than die, While dastards forfeit life and glory both. So moved he them, themselves already bent To chace the Trojans; yet his word they bore Faithful in mind, and with a wall of brass Fenced firm the fleet, while Jove impell'd the foe. Then Menelaus, brave in fight, approach'd Antilochus, and thus his courage roused. Antilochus! in all the host is none Younger, or swifter, or of stronger limb Than thou. Make trial, therefore, of thy might, Spring forth and prove it on some Chief of Troy. He ended and retired, but him his praise Effectual animated; from the van Starting, he cast a wistful eye around And hurl'd his glittering spear; back fell the ranks Of Troy appall'd; nor vain his weapon flew, But Melanippus pierced heroic son Of Hicetaon, coming forth to fight, Full in the bosom, and with dreadful sound Of all his batter'd armour down he fell. Swift flew Antilochus as flies the hound Some fawn to seize, which issuing from her lair The hunter with his lance hath stricken dead, So thee, O Melanippus! to despoil Of thy bright arms valiant Antilochus Sprang forth, but not unnoticed by the eye Of noble Hector, who through all the war Ran to encounter him; his dread approach Antilochus, although expert in arms, Stood not, but as some prowler of the wilds, Conscious of injury that he hath done, Slaying the watchful herdsman or his dog, Escapes, ere yet the peasantry arise, So fled the son of Nestor, after whom The Trojans clamouring and Hector pour'd Darts numberless; but at the front arrived Of his own phalanx, there he turn'd and stood. Then, eager as voracious lions, rush'd The Trojans on the fleet of Greece, the mind Of Jove accomplishing who them impell'd Continual, calling all their courage forth, While, every Greecian heart he tamed, and took Their glory from them, strengthening Ilium's host. For Jove's unalter'd purpose was to give Success to Priameian Hector's arms, That he might cast into the fleet of Greece Devouring flames, and that no part might fail Of Thetis' ruthless prayer; that sight alone He watch'd to see, one galley in a blaze, Ordaining foul repulse, thenceforth, and flight To Ilium's host, but glory to the Greeks. Such was the cause for which, at first, he moved To that assault Hector, himself prepared And ardent for the task; nor less he raged Than Mars while fighting, or than flames that seize Some forest on the mountain-tops; the foam Hung at his lips, beneath his awful front His keen eyes glisten'd, and his helmet mark'd The agitation wild with which he fought. For Jove omnipotent, himself, from heaven Assisted Hector, and, although alone With multitudes he strove, gave him to reach The heights of glory, for that now his life Waned fast, and, urged by Pallas on, his hour To die by Peleus' mighty son approach'd. He then, wherever richest arms he saw And thickest throng, the warrior-ranks essay'd To break, but broke them not, though fierce resolved, In even square compact so firm they stood. As some vast rock beside the hoary Deep The stress endures of many a hollow wind, And the huge billows tumbling at his base, So stood the Danaï, nor fled nor fear'd. But He, all-fiery bright in arms, the host Assail'd on every side, and on the van Fell, as a wave by wintery blasts upheaved Falls ponderous on the ship; white clings the foam Around her, in her sail shrill howls the storm, And every seaman trembles at the view Of thousand deaths from which he scarce escapes, Such anguish rent the bosom of the Greeks. This termination of the period, so little consonant to the beginning of it, follows the original, where it is esteemed by commentators a great beauty.But He, as leaps a famish'd lion fell On beeves that graze some marshy meadow's breadth A countless herd, tended by one unskill'd To cope with savage beasts in their defence, Beside the foremost kine or with the last He paces heedless, but the lion, borne Impetuous on the midmost, one devours And scatters all the rest, This termination of the period, so little consonant to the beginning of it, follows the original, where it is esteemed by commentators a great beauty. so fled the Greeks, Terrified from above, before the arm Of Hector, and before the frown of Jove. All fled, but of them all alone he slew The Mycenæan Periphetes, son Of Copreus custom'd messenger of King Eurystheus to the might of Hercules. From such a sire inglorious had arisen A son far worthier, with all virtue graced, Swift-footed, valiant, and by none excell'd In wisdom of the Mycenæan name; Yet all but served to ennoble Hector more. For Periphetes, with a backward step Retiring, on his buckler's border trod, Which swept his heels; so check'd, he fell supine, And dreadful rang the helmet on his brows. Him Hector quick noticing, to his side Hasted, and, planting in his breast a spear, Slew him before the phalanx of his friends. But they, although their fellow-warrior's fate They mourn'd, no succour interposed, or could, Themselves by noble Hector sore appall'd. And now behind the ships (all that updrawn Above the shore, stood foremost of the fleet) The Greeks retired; in rush'd a flood of foes; Then, through necessity, the ships in front Abandoning, amid the tents they stood Compact, not disarray'd, for shame and fear Fast held them, and vociferating each Aloud, call'd ceaseless on the rest to stand. But earnest more than all, guardian of all, Gerenian Nestor in their parents' name Implored them, falling at the knees of each. Oh friends! be men. Now dearly prize your place Each in the estimation of the rest. Now call to memory your children, wives, Possessions, parents; ye whose parents live, And ye whose parents are not, all alike! By them as if here present, I entreat That ye stand fast,—Oh be not turn'd to flight! So saying he roused the courage of the Greeks; Then, Pallas chaced the cloud fall'n from above On every eye; great light the plain illumed On all sides, both toward the fleet, and where The undiscriminating battle raged. Then might be seen Hector and Hector's host Distinct, as well the rearmost who the fight Shared not, as those who waged it at the ships. To stand aloof where other Greecians stood No longer now would satisfy the mind Of Ajax, but from deck to deck with strides Enormous marching, to and fro he swung With iron studs emboss'd a battle-pole Unwieldy, twenty and two cubits long. As one, expert to spring from horse to horse, From many steeds selecting four, toward Some noble city drives them from the plain Along the populous road; him many a youth And many a maiden eyes, while still secure From steed to steed he vaults; they rapid fly; So Ajax o'er the decks of numerous ships Stalk'd striding large, and sent his voice to heaven. Thus, ever clamouring, he bade the Greeks Stand both for camp and fleet. Nor could himself Hector, contented, now, the battle wage Lost in the multitude of Trojans more, But as the tawny eagle on full wing Assails the feather'd nations, geese or cranes Or swans lithe-neck'd grazing the river's verge, So Hector at a galley sable-prow'd Darted; for, from behind, Jove urged him on With mighty hand, and his host after him. And now again the battle at the ships Grew furious; thou hadst deem'd them of a kind By toil untameable, so fierce they strove, And, striving, thus they thought. The Greecians judged Hope vain, and the whole host's destruction sure; But nought expected every Trojan less Than to consume the fleet with fire, and leave Achaia's heroes lifeless on the field. With such persuasion occupied, they fought. Then Hector seized the stern of a brave bark Well-built, sharp-keel'd, and of the swiftest sail, Which had to Troy Protesiläus brought, But bore him never thence. For that same ship Contending, Greeks and Trojans hand to hand Dealt slaughter mutual. Javelins now no more Might serve them, or the arrow-starting bow, But close conflicting and of one mind all With bill and battle-axe, with ponderous swords And with long lances double-edged they fought. Many a black-hilted faulchion huge of haft Fell to the ground, some from the grasp, and some From shoulders of embattled warriors hewn, And pools of blood soak'd all the sable glebe. Hector that ship once grappled by the stern Left not, but griping fast her upper edge With both hands, to his Trojans call'd aloud. Fire! Bring me fire! Stand fast and shout to heaven! Jove gives us now a day worth all the past; The ships are ours which, in the Gods' despight Steer'd hither, such calamities to us Have caused, for which our Seniors most I blame Who me withheld from battle at the fleet And check'd the people; but if then the hand Of Thunderer Jove our better judgement marr'd, Himself now urges and commands us—On. He ceased; they still more violent assail'd The Greecians. Even Ajax could endure, Whelm'd under weapons numberless, that storm No longer, but expecting death retired Down from the decks to an inferior stand, Where still he watch'd, and if a Trojan bore Fire thither, he repulsed him with his spear, Roaring continual to the host of Greece. Friends! Greecian heroes! ministers of Mars! Be men, my friends! now summon all your might! Think we that we have thousands at our backs To succour us, or yet some stronger wall To guard our warriors from the battle's force? Not so. No tower'd city is at hand, None that presents us with a safe retreat While others occupy our station here, But from the shores of Argos far remote Our camp is, where the Trojans arm'd complete Swarm on the plain, and Ocean shuts us in. Our hands must therefore save us, not our heels. He said, and furious with his spear again Press'd them, and whatsoever Trojan came, Obsequious to the will of Hector, arm'd With fire to burn the fleet, on his spear's point Ajax receiving pierced him, till at length Twelve in close fight fell by his single arm. BOOK XVI. ARGUMENT OF THE SIXTEENTH BOOK. Achilles, at the suit of Patroclus, grants him his own armour, and permission to lead the Myrmidons to battle. They, sallying, repulse the Trojans. Patroclus slays Sarpedon, and Hector, when Apollo had first stripped off his armour and Euphorbus wounded him, slays Patroclus. Such contest for that gallant bark they waged. Meantime Patroclus, standing at the side Of the illustrious Chief Achilles, wept Fast as a crystal fountain from the height Of some rude rock pours down its rapid This translation of ???????? is warranted by the Scholiast, who paraphrases it thus:— ???? ???????? ?????????. Iliad per Vill. stream. Divine Achilles with compassion moved Mark'd him, and in wing'd accents thus began. Why weeps Patroclus like an infant girl Who, running at her mother's side, entreats To be uplifted in her arms? She grasps Her mantle, checks her haste, and looking up With tearful eyes, pleads earnest to be borne; So fall, Patroclus! thy unceasing tears. Bring'st thou to me or to my people aught Afflictive? Hast thou mournful tidings learn'd From Phthia, trusted to thine ear alone? Menœtius, son of Actor, as they say, Still lives; still lives his Myrmidons among Peleus Æacides; whom, were they dead, With cause sufficient we should both deplore. Or weep'st thou the Achaians at the ships Perishing, for their outrage done to me? Speak. Name thy trouble. I would learn the cause. To whom, deep-sorrowing, thou didst reply, Patroclus! Oh Achilles, Peleus' son! Noblest of all our host! bear with my grief, Since such distress hath on the Greecians fallen. The bravest of their ships disabled lie, Some wounded from afar, some hand to hand. Diomede, warlike son of Tydeus, bleeds, Gall'd by a shaft; Ulysses, glorious Chief, And Agamemnon suffer by the spear, And brave Eurypylus an arrow-point Bears in his thigh. These all, are now the care Of healing hands. Oh thou art pity-proof, Achilles! be my bosom ever free From anger such as harbour finds in thine, Scorning all limits! whom, of men unborn, Hereafter wilt thou save, from whom avert Disgrace, if not from the Achaians now? Ah ruthless! neither Peleus thee begat, Nor Thetis bore, but rugged rocks sublime, And roaring billows blue gave birth to thee, Who bear'st a mind that knows not to relent. But, if some prophecy alarm thy fears, If from thy Goddess-mother thou have aught Received, and with authority of Jove, Me send at least, me quickly, and with me The Myrmidons. A dawn of cheerful hope Shall thence, it may be, on the Greeks arise. Grant me thine armour also, that the foe Thyself supposing present, may abstain From battle, and the weary Greeks enjoy Short respite; it is all that war allows. We, fresh and vigorous, by our shouts alone May easily repulse an army spent With labour from the camp, and from the fleet. Such suit he made, alas! all unforewarn'd That his own death should be the bitter fruit, And thus Achilles, sorrowful, replied. Patroclus, noble friend! what hast thou spoken? Me neither prophecy that I have heard Holds in suspense, nor aught that I have learn'd From Thetis with authority of Jove! Hence springs, and hence alone, my grief of heart; If one, in nought superior to myself Save in his office only, should by force Amerce me of my well-earn'd recompense— How then? There lies the grief that stings my soul. The virgin chosen for me by the sons Of Greece, my just reward, by my own spear Obtain'd when I Eëtion's city took, Her, Agamemnon, leader of the host From my possession wrung, as I had been Some alien wretch, unhonour'd and unknown. But let it pass; anger is not a flame To feed for ever; I affirm'd, indeed, Mine inextinguishable till the shout Of battle should invade my proper barks; But thou put on my glorious arms, lead forth My valiant Myrmidons, since such a cloud, So dark, of dire hostility surrounds The fleet, and the Achaians, by the waves Hemm'd in, are prison'd now in narrow space. Because the Trojans meet not in the field My dazzling helmet, therefore bolder grown All Ilium comes abroad; but had I found Kindness at royal Agamemnon's hands, Soon had they fled, and with their bodies choak'd The streams, from whom ourselves now suffer siege. For in the hands of Diomede his spear No longer rages rescuing from death The afflicted Danaï, nor hear I more The voice of Agamemnon issuing harsh From his detested throat, but all around The burst ???????????. A word of incomparable force, and that defies translation. of homicidal Hector's cries, Calling his Trojans on; they loud insult The vanquish'd Greeks, and claim the field their own. Go therefore, my Patroclus; furious fall On these assailants, even now preserve From fire the only hope of our return. But hear the sum of all; mark well my word; So shalt thou glorify me in the eyes Of all the Danaï, and they shall yield Brisëis mine, with many a gift beside. The Trojans from the fleet expell'd, return. Should Juno's awful spouse give thee to win Victory, be content; seek not to press The Trojans without me, for thou shalt add Still more to the disgrace already mine. Much less, by martial ardour urged, conduct Thy slaughtering legions to the walls of Troy, Lest some immortal power on her behalf Descend, for much the Archer of the skies Loves Ilium. No—the fleet once saved, lead back Thy band, and leave the battle to themselves. For oh, by all the powers of heaven I would That not one Trojan might escape of all, Nor yet a Greecian, but that we, from death Ourselves escaping, might survive to spread Troy's sacred bulwarks on the ground, alone. Thus they conferr'd. But Ajax overwhelm'd Meantime with darts, no longer could endure, Quell'd both by Jupiter and by the spears Of many a noble Trojan; hideous rang His batter'd helmet bright, stroke after stroke Sustaining on all sides, and his left arm That had so long shifted from side to side His restless shield, now fail'd; yet could not all Displace him with united force, or move. Quick pantings heaved his chest, copious the sweat Trickled from all his limbs, nor found he time, However short, to breathe again, so close Evil on evil heap'd hemm'd him around. Olympian Muses! now declare, how first The fire was kindled in Achaia's fleet? Hector the ashen lance of Ajax smote With his broad faulchion, at the nether end, And lopp'd it sheer. The Telamonian Chief His mutilated beam brandish'd in vain, And the bright point shrill-sounding fell remote. Then Ajax in his noble mind perceived, Shuddering with awe, the interposing power Of heaven, and that, propitious to the arms Of Troy, the Thunderer had ordain'd to mar And frustrate all the counsels of the Greeks. He left his stand; they fired the gallant bark; Through all her length the conflagration ran Incontinent, and wrapp'd her stern in flames. Achilles saw them, smote his thighs, and said, Patroclus, noble charioteer, arise! I see the rapid run of hostile fires Already in the fleet—lest all be lost, And our return impossible, arm, arm This moment; I will call, myself, the band. Then put Patroclus on his radiant arms. Around his legs his polish'd greaves he clasp'd, With argent studs secured; the hauberk rich Star-spangled to his breast he bound of swift Æacides; he slung his brazen sword With silver bright emboss'd, and his broad shield Ponderous; on his noble head his casque He settled elegant, whose lofty crest Waved dreadful o'er his brows, and last he seized Well fitted to his gripe two sturdy spears. Of all Achilles' arms his spear alone He took not; that huge beam, of bulk and length Enormous, none, Æacides except, In all Achaia's host had power to wield. It was that Pelian ash which from the top Of Pelion hewn that it might prove the death Of heroes, Chiron had to Peleus given. He bade Automedon his coursers bind Speedily to the yoke, for him he loved Next to Achilles most, as worthiest found Of trust, what time the battle loudest roar'd. Then led Automedon the fiery steeds Swift as wing'd tempests to the chariot-yoke, Xanthus and Balius. Them the harpy bore Podarge, while in meadows green she fed On Ocean's side, to Zephyrus the wind. To these he added, at their side, a third The noble Pedasus; him Peleus' son, Eëtion's city taken, thence had brought, Though mortal, yet a match for steeds divine. Meantime from every tent Achilles call'd And arm'd his Myrmidons. As wolves that gorge The prey yet panting, terrible in force, When on the mountains wild they have devour'd An antler'd stag new-slain, with bloody jaws Troop all at once to some clear fountain, there To lap with slender tongues the brimming wave; No fears have they, but at their ease eject From full maws flatulent the clotted gore; Such seem'd the Myrmidon heroic Chiefs Assembling fast around the valiant friend Of swift Æacides. Amid them stood Warlike Achilles, the well-shielded ranks Exhorting, and the steeds, to glorious war. The galleys by Achilles dear to Jove Commanded, when to Ilium's coast he steer'd, Were fifty; fifty rowers sat in each, And five, in whom he trusted, o'er the rest He captains named, but ruled, himself, supreme. One band Menestheus swift in battle led, Offspring of Sperchius heaven-descended stream. Him Polydora, Peleus' daughter, bore To ever-flowing Sperchius, compress'd, Although a mortal woman, by a God. But his reputed father was the son Of Perieres, Borus, who with dower Enrich'd, and made her openly his bride. Warlike Eudorus led the second band. Him Polymela, graceful in the dance, And daughter beautiful of Phylas, bore, A mother unsuspected of a child. Her worshipping the golden-shafted Queen Diana, in full choir, with song and dance, The valiant Argicide beheld and loved. Ascending with her to an upper room, All-bounteous Mercury clandestine there Embraced her, who a noble son produced Eudorus, swift to run, and bold in fight. No sooner Ilithya, arbitress Of pangs puerperal, had given him birth, And he beheld the beaming sun, than her Echechleus, Actor's mighty son, enrich'd With countless dower, and led her to his home; While ancient Phylas, cherishing her boy With fond affection, reared him as his own. The third brave troop warlike Pisander led, Offspring of Maimalus; he far excell'd In spear-fight every Myrmidon, the friend Of Peleus' dauntless son alone except. The hoary Phœnix of equestrian fame The fourth band led to battle, and the fifth Laërceus' offspring, bold Alcimedon. Thus, all his bands beneath their proper Chiefs Marshall'd, Achilles gave them strict command— Myrmidons! all that vengeance now inflict, Which in this fleet ye ceased not to denounce Against the Trojans while my wrath endured. Me censuring, ye have proclaim'd me oft Obdurate. Oh Achilles! ye have said, Thee not with milk thy mother but with bile Suckled, who hold'st thy people here in camp Thus long imprison'd. Unrelenting Chief! Even let us hence in our sea-skimming barks To Phthia, since thou can'st not be appeased— Thus in full council have ye spoken oft. Now, therefore, since a day of glorious toil At last appears, such as ye have desired, There lies the field—go—give your courage proof. So them he roused, and they, their leader's voice Hearing elate, to closest order drew. As when an architect some palace wall With shapely stones upbuilds, cementing close A barrier against all the winds of heaven, So wedged, the helmets and boss'd bucklers stood; Shield, helmet, man, press'd helmet, man, and shield, And every bright-arm'd warrior's bushy crest Its fellow swept, so dense was their array. In front of all, two Chiefs their station took, Patroclus and Automedon; one mind In both prevail'd, to combat in the van Of all the Myrmidons. Achilles, then, Retiring to his tent, displaced the lid Of a capacious chest magnificent By silver footed Thetis stow'd on board His bark, and fill'd with tunics, mantles warm, And gorgeous arras; there he also kept Secure a goblet exquisitely wrought, Which never lip touch'd save his own, and whence He offer'd only to the Sire of all. That cup producing from the chest, he first With sulphur fumed it, then with water rinsed Pellucid of the running stream, and, last (His hands clean laved) he charged it high with wine. And now, advancing to his middle court, He pour'd libation, and with eyes to heaven Uplifted pray'd, of Jove not unobserved. Pelasgian, Dodonæan Jove supreme, Dwelling remote, who on Dodona's heights Snow-clad reign'st Sovereign, by thy seers around Compass'd the Selli, prophets vow-constrain'd To unwash'd feet and slumbers on the ground! Plain I behold my former prayer perform'd, Myself exalted, and the Greeks abased. Now also grant me, Jove, this my desire! Here, in my fleet, I shall myself abide, But lo! with all these Myrmidons I send My friend to battle. Thunder-rolling Jove, Send glory with him, make his courage firm! That even Hector may himself be taught, If my companion have a valiant heart When he goes forth alone, or only then The noble frenzy feels that Mars inspires When I rush also to the glorious field. But when he shall have driven the battle-shout Once from the fleet, grant him with all his arms, None lost, himself unhurt, and my whole band Of dauntless warriors with him, safe return! Such prayer Achilles offer'd, and his suit Jove hearing, part confirm'd, and part refused; To chase the dreadful battle from the fleet He gave him, but vouchsafed him no return. Prayer and libation thus perform'd to Jove The Sire of all, Achilles to his tent Return'd, replaced the goblet in his chest, And anxious still that conflict to behold Between the hosts, stood forth before his tent. Then rush'd the bands by brave Patroclus led, Full on the Trojan host. As wasps forsake Their home by the way-side, provoked by boys Disturbing inconsiderate their abode, Not without nuisance sore to all who pass, For if, thenceforth, some traveller unaware Annoy them, issuing one and all they swarm Around him, fearless in their broods' defence, So issued from their feet the Myrmidons Undaunted; clamour infinite arose, And thus Patroclus loud his host address'd. Oh Myrmidons, attendants in the field On Peleus' son, now be ye men, my friends! Call now to mind the fury of your might; That we, close-fighting servants of the Chief Most excellent in all the camp of Greece, May glory gain for Him, and that the wide- Commanding Agamemnon, Atreus' son, May learn his fault, that he dishonour'd foul The prince in whom Achaia glories most. So saying he fired their hearts, and on the van Of Troy at once they fell; loud shouted all The joyful Greecians, and the navy rang. Then, soon as Ilium's host the valiant son Saw of Menœtius and his charioteer In dazzling armour clad, all courage lost, Their closest ranks gave way, believing sure That, wrath renounced, and terms of friendship chosen, Achilles' self was there; thus thinking, each Look'd every way for refuge from his fate. Patroclus first, where thickest throng he saw Gather'd tumultuous around the bark Of brave Protesilaüs, hurl'd direct At the whole multitude his glittering spear. He smote Pyræchmes; he his horseman band Pœonian led from Amydon, and from Broad-flowing Axius. In his shoulder stood The spear, and with loud groans supine he fell. At once fled all his followers, on all sides With consternation fill'd, seeing their Chief And their best warrior, by Patroclus slain. Forth from the fleet he drove them, quench'd the flames, And rescued half the ship. Then scatter'd fled With infinite uproar the host of Troy, While from between their ships the Danaï Pour'd after them, and hideous rout ensued. As when the king of lightnings, Jove, dispels From some huge eminence a gloomy cloud, The groves, the mountain-tops, the headland heights Shine all, illumined from the boundless heaven, So when the Danaï those hostile fires Had from their fleet expell'd, awhile they breathed, Yet found short respite, for the battle yet Ceased not, nor fled the Trojans in all parts Alike, but still resisted, from the ships Retiring through necessity alone. Then, in that scatter'd warfare, every Chief Slew one. While Areïlochus his back Turn'd on Patroclus, sudden with a lance His thigh he pierced, and urged the weapon through, Shivering the bone; he headlong smote the ground. The Hero Menelaus, where he saw The breast of Thoas by his slanting shield Unguarded, struck and stretch'd him at his feet. Phylides Meges., meeting with preventive spear The furious onset of Amphiclus, gash'd His leg below the knee, where brawny most The muscles swell in man; disparted wide The tendons shrank, and darkness veil'd his eyes. The two Nestoridæ slew each a Chief. Of these, Antilochus Atymnius pierced Right through his flank, and at his feet he fell. With fierce resentment fired Maris beheld His brother's fall, and guarding, spear in hand, The slain, impetuous on the conqueror flew; But godlike Thrasymedes Brother of Antilochus. wounded first Maris, ere he Antilochus; he pierced His upper arm, and with the lance's point Rent off and stript the muscles to the bone. Sounding he fell, and darkness veil'd his eyes. They thus, two brothers by two brothers slain, Went down to Erebus, associates both Of brave Sarpedon, and spear-practised sons Of Amisodarus; of him who fed Chimæra ???????????—is a word which I can find nowhere satisfactorily derived. Perhaps it is expressive of great length, and I am the more inclined to that sense of it, because it is the epithet given to the mast on which Ulysses floated to Charybdis. We must in that case derive it from ??? and ????? Doricè, ?????—longitudo In this uncertainty I thought myself free to translate it as I have, by the word—monster., monster, by whom many died. Ajax the swift on Cleobulus sprang, Whom while he toil'd entangled in the crowd, He seized alive, but smote him where he stood With his huge-hafted sword full on the neck; The blood warm'd all his blade, and ruthless fate Benighted dark the dying warrior's eyes. Peneleus into close contention rush'd And Lycon. Each had hurl'd his glittering spear, But each in vain, and now with swords they met. He smote Peneleus on the crested casque, But snapp'd his faulchion; him Peneleus smote Beneath his ear; the whole blade entering sank Into his neck, and Lycon with his head Depending by the skin alone, expired. Meriones o'ertaking Acamas Ere yet he could ascend his chariot, thrust A lance into his shoulder; down he fell In dreary death's eternal darkness whelm'd. Idomeneus his ruthless spear enforced Into the mouth of Erymas. The point Stay'd not, but gliding close beneath the brain, Transpierced his spine Apollonius says that the ????? ????? here mean the ??????????, or vertebræ of the neck. —See Villoisson., and started forth beyond. It wrench'd his teeth, and fill'd his eyes with blood; Blood also blowing through his open mouth And nostrils, to the realms of death he pass'd. Thus slew these Greecian leaders, each, a foe. Sudden as hungry wolves the kids purloin Or lambs, which haply some unheeding swain Hath left to roam at large the mountains wild; They, seeing, snatch them from beside the dams, And rend incontinent the feeble prey, So swift the Danaï the host assail'd Of Ilium; they, into tumultuous flight Together driven, all hope, all courage lost. Huge Ajax ceaseless sought his spear to cast At Hector brazen-mail'd, who, not untaught The warrior's art, with bull-hide buckler stood Sheltering his ample shoulders, while he mark'd The hiss of flying shafts and crash of spears. Full sure he saw the shifting course of war Now turn'd, but scorning flight, bent all his thoughts To rescue yet the remnant of his friends. As when the Thunderer spreads a sable storm O'er ether, late serene, the cloud that wrapp'd Olympus' head escapes into the skies, So fled the Trojans from the fleet of Greece Clamouring in their flight, nor pass'd the trench In fair array; the coursers fleet indeed Of Hector, Him bore safe with all his arms Right through, but in the foss entangled foul He left his host, and struggling to escape. Then many a chariot-whirling steed, the pole Broken at its extremity, forsook His driver, while Patroclus with the shout Of battle calling his Achaians on, Destruction purposed to the powers of Troy. They, once dispersed, with clamour and with flight Fill'd all the ways, the dust beneath the clouds Hung like a tempest, and the steeds firm-hoof'd Whirl'd off at stretch the chariots to the town. He, wheresoe'er most troubled he perceived The routed host, loud-threatening thither drove, While under his own axle many a Chief Fell prone, and the o'ertumbled chariots rang. Right o'er the hollow foss the coursers leap'd Immortal, by the Gods to Peleus given, Impatient for the plain, nor less desire Felt he who drove to smite the Trojan Chief, But him his fiery steeds caught swift away. As when a tempest from autumnal skies Floats all the fields, what time Jove heaviest pours Impetuous rain, token of wrath divine Against perverters of the laws by force, Who drive forth justice, reckless of the Gods; The rivers and the torrents, where they dwell, Sweep many a green declivity away, And plunge at length, groaning, into the Deep From the hills headlong, leaving where they pass'd No traces of the pleasant works of man, So, in their flight, loud groan'd the steeds of Troy. And now, their foremost intercepted all, Patroclus back again toward the fleet Drove them precipitate, nor the ascent Permitted them to Troy for which they strove, But in the midway space between the ships The river and the lofty Trojan wall Pursued them ardent, slaughtering whom he reach'd, And vengeance took for many a Greecian slain. First then, with glittering spear the breast he pierced Of Pronöus, undefended by his shield, And stretch'd him dead; loud rang his batter'd arms. The son of Enops, Thestor next he smote. He on his chariot-seat magnificent Low-cowering sat, a fear-distracted form, And from his palsied grasp the reins had fallen. Then came Patroclus nigh, and through his cheek His teeth transpiercing, drew him by his lance Sheer o'er the chariot front. As when a man On some projecting rock seated, with line And splendid hook draws forth a sea-fish huge, So him wide-gaping from his seat he drew At his spear-point, then shook him to the ground Prone on his face, where gasping he expired. At Eryalus, next, advancing swift He hurl'd a rock; full on the middle front He smote him, and within the ponderous casque His whole head open'd into equal halves. With deadliest night surrounded, prone he fell. Epaltes, Erymas, Amphoterus, Echius, Tlepolemus Damastor's son, Evippus, Ipheus, Pyres, Polymelus, All these he on the champain, corse on corse Promiscuous flung. Sarpedon, when he saw Such havoc made of his uncinctured ????????????? is a word, according to Clarke, descriptive of their peculiar habit. Their corslet, and the mail worn under it, were of a piece, and put on together. To them therefore the cincture or belt of the Greeks was unnecessary. friends By Menœtiades, with sharp rebuke His band of godlike Lycians loud address'd. Shame on you, Lycians! whither would ye fly? Now are ye swift indeed! I will oppose Myself this conqueror, that I may learn Who thus afflicts the Trojan host, of life Bereaving numerous of their warriors bold. He said, and with his arms leap'd to the ground. On the other side, Patroclus at that sight Sprang from his chariot. As two vultures clash Bow-beak'd, crook-talon'd, on some lofty rock Clamouring both, so they together rush'd With clamours loud; whom when the son observed Of wily Saturn, with compassion moved His sister and his spouse he thus bespake. Alas he falls! my most beloved of men Sarpedon, vanquish'd by Patroclus falls! So will the Fates. Yet, doubtful, much I muse Whether to place him, snatch'd from furious fight, In Lycia's wealthy realm, or to permit His death by valiant Menœtiades. To whom his awful spouse, displeased, replied. How speaks the terrible Saturnian Jove? Wouldst thou again from pangs of death exempt A mortal man, destined long since to die? Do it. But small thy praise shall be in heaven. Mark thou my words, and in thy inmost breast Treasure them. If thou send Sarpedon safe To his own home, how many Gods their sons May also send from battle? Weigh it well. For under yon great city fight no few Sprung from Immortals whom thou shalt provoke. But if thou love him, and thine heart his lot Commiserate, leave him by the hands to fall Of Menœtiades in conflict dire; But give command to Death and gentle Sleep That him of life bereft at once they bear To Lycia's ample realm, where, with due rites Funereal, his next kindred and his friends Shall honour him, a pillar and a tomb (The dead man's portion) rearing to his name. She said, from whom the Sire of Gods and men Dissented not, but on the earth distill'd A sanguine shower in honour of a son Dear to him, whom Patroclus on the field Of fruitful Troy should slay, far from his home. Opposite now, small interval between, Those heroes stood. Patroclus at his waist Pierced Thrasymelus the illustrious friend Of King Sarpedon, and his charioteer. Spear'd through the lower bowels, dead he fell. Then hurl'd Sarpedon in his turn a lance, But miss'd Patroclus and the shoulder pierced Of Pedasus the horse; he groaning heaved His spirit forth, and fallen on the field In long loud moanings sorrowful expired. Wide started the immortal pair; the yoke Creak'd, and entanglement of reins ensued To both, their fellow slaughter'd at their side. That mischief soon Automedon redress'd. He rose, and from beside his sturdy thigh Drawing his faulchion, with effectual stroke Cut loose the side-horse; then the pair reduced To order, in their traces stood composed, And the two heroes fierce engaged again. Again his radiant spear Sarpedon hurl'd, But miss'd Patroclus; the innocuous point, O'erflying his left shoulder, pass'd beyond. Then with bright lance Patroclus in his turn Assail'd Sarpedon, nor with erring course The weapon sped or vain, but pierced profound His chest, enclosure of the guarded heart. As falls an oak, poplar, or lofty pine With new-edged axes on the mountains hewn Right through, for structure of some gallant bark, So fell Sarpedon stretch'd his steeds before And gnash'd his teeth and clutch'd the bloody dust. And as a lion slays a tawny bull Leader magnanimous of all the herd; Beneath the lion's jaws groaning he dies; So, leader of the shielded Lycians groan'd Indignant, by Patroclus slain, the bold Sarpedon, and his friend thus, sad, bespake. Glaucus, my friend, among these warring Chiefs Thyself a Chief illustrious! thou hast need Of all thy valour now; now strenuous fight, And, if thou bear within thee a brave mind, Now make the war's calamities thy joy. First, marching through the host of Lycia, rouse Our Chiefs to combat for Sarpedon slain, Then haste, thyself, to battle for thy friend. For shame and foul dishonour which no time Shall e'er obliterate, I must prove to thee, Should the Achaians of my glorious arms Despoil me in full prospect Sarpedon certainly was not slain in the fleet, neither can the Greek expression ???? ?? ????? be with propriety interpreted —in certamine de navibus—as Clarke and M?? Dacier are inclined to render it. Juvenum in certamine, seems equally an improbable sense of it. Eustathius, indeed, and Terrasson, supposing Sarpedon to assert that he dies in the middle of the fleet, (which was false in fact,) are kind enough to vindicate Homer by pleading in his favour, that Sarpedon, being in the article of death, was delirious, and knew not, in reality, where he died. But Homer, however he may have been charged with now and then a nap, (a crime of which I am persuaded he is never guilty,) certainly does not slumber here, nor needs to be so defended. ????, in the 23d Iliad, means the whole extensive area in which the games were exhibited, and may therefore here, without any strain of the expression, be understood to signify the whole range of shore on which the ships were stationed. In which case Sarpedon represents the matter as it was, saying that he dies—???? ?? ?????,—that is, in the neighbourhood of the ships, and in full prospect of them. The Translator assumes not to himself the honour of this judicious remark. It belongs to Mr. Fuseli. of the fleet. Fight, therefore, thou, and others urge to fight. He said, and cover'd by the night of death, Nor look'd nor breathed again; for on his chest Implanting firm his heel, Patroclus drew The spear enfolded with his vitals forth, Weapon and life at once. Meantime his steeds Snorted by Myrmidons detain'd, and, loosed From their own master's chariot, foam'd to fly. Terrible was the grief by Glaucus felt Hearing that charge, and troubled was his heart That all power fail'd him to protect the dead. Compressing his own arm he stood, with pain Extreme tormented which the shaft had caused Of Teucer, who while Glaucus climb'd the wall, Had pierced him from it in the fleet's defence. Then, thus, to Phœbus, King shaft-arm'd, he pray'd. Hear now, O King! For whether in the land Of wealthy Lycia dwelling, or in Troy, Thou hear'st in every place alike the prayer Of the afflicted heart, and such is mine; Behold my wound; it fills my useless hand With anguish, neither can my blood be stay'd, And all my shoulder suffers. I can grasp A spear, or rush to conflict with the Greeks No longer now; and we have also lost Our noblest Chief, Sarpedon, son of Jove, Who guards not his own son. But thou, O King! Heal me, assuage my anguish, give me strength, That I may animate the Lycian host To fight, and may, myself, defend the dead! Such prayer he offer'd, whom Apollo heard; He eased at once his pain, the sable blood Staunch'd, and his soul with vigour new inspired. Then Glaucus in his heart that prayer perceived Granted, and joyful for the sudden aid Vouchsafed to him by Phœbus, first the lines Of Lycia ranged, summoning every Chief To fight for slain Sarpedon; striding next With eager haste into the ranks of Troy, Renown'd Agenor and the son he call'd Of Panthus, brave Polydamas, with whom Æneas also, and approaching last To Hector brazen-mail'd him thus bespake. Now, Hector! now, thou hast indeed resign'd All care of thy allies, who, for thy sake, Lost both to friends and country, on these plains Perish, unaided and unmiss'd by thee. Sarpedon breathless lies, who led to fight Our shielded bands, and from whose just controul And courage Lycia drew her chief defence. Him brazen Mars hath by the spear subdued Of Menœtiades. But stand ye firm! Let indignation fire you, O my friends! Lest, stripping him of his resplendent arms, The Myrmidons with foul dishonour shame His body, through resentment of the deaths Of numerous Greecians slain by spears of ours. He ceased; then sorrow every Trojan heart Seized insupportable and that disdain'd All bounds, for that, although a stranger born, Sarpedon ever had a bulwark proved To Troy, the leader of a numerous host, And of that host by none in fight excell'd. Right on toward the Danaï they moved Ardent for battle all, and at their head Enraged for slain Sarpedon, Hector came. Meantime, stout-hearted ?????? ???. Chief, Patroclus roused The Greecians, and exhorting first (themselves Already prompt) the Ajaces, thus began. Heroic pair! now make it all your joy To chace the Trojan host, and such to prove As erst, or even bolder, if ye may. The Chief lies breathless who ascended first Our wall, Sarpedon. Let us bear him hence, Strip and dishonour him, and in the blood Of his protectors drench the ruthless spear. So Menœtiades his warriors urged, Themselves courageous. Then the Lycian host And Trojan here, and there the Myrmidons With all the host of Greece, closing the ranks Rush'd into furious contest for the dead, Shouting tremendous; clang'd their brazen arms, And Jove with Night's pernicious shades o'erhung The bloody field, so to enhance the more Their toilsome strife for his own son. First then The Trojans from their place and order shock'd The bright-eyed Greecians, slaying not the least Nor worst among the Myrmidons, the brave Epigeus, from renown'd Agacles sprung. He, erst, in populous Budeum ruled, But for a valiant kinsman of his own Whom there he slew, had thence to Peleus fled And to his silver-footed spouse divine, Who with Achilles, phalanx-breaker Chief, Sent him to fight beneath the walls of Troy. Him seizing fast the body, with a stone Illustrious Hector smote full on the front, And his whole scull within the ponderous casque Split sheer; he prostrate on the body fell In shades of soul-divorcing death involved. Patroclus, grieving for his slaughter'd friend, Rush'd through the foremost warriors. As the hawk Swift-wing'd before him starlings drives or daws, So thou Patroclus, of equestrian fame! Full on the Lycian ranks and Trojan drov'st Resentful of thy fellow-warrior's fall. At Stheneläus an huge stone he cast Son of Ithæmenes, whom on the neck He smote and burst the tendons; then the van Of Ilium's host, with Hector, all retired. Far as the slender javelin cuts the air Hurl'd with collected force, or in the games, Or even in battle at a desperate foe, So far the Greeks repulsed the host of Troy. Then Glaucus first, Chief of the shielded bands Of Lycia, slew Bathycles, valiant son Of Calchon; Hellas was his home, and far He pass'd in riches all the Myrmidons. Him chasing Glaucus whom he now attain'd, The Lycian, turning sudden, with his lance Pierced through the breast, and, sounding, down he fell. Grief fill'd Achaia's sons for such a Chief So slain, but joy the Trojans; thick they throng'd The conqueror around, nor yet the Greeks Forgat their force, but resolute advanced. Then, by Meriones a Trojan died Of noble rank, Laogonus, the son Undaunted of Onetor great in Troy, Priest of Idæan Jove. The ear and jaw Between, he pierced him with a mortal force; Swift flew the life, and darkness veil'd his eyes. Æneas, in return, his brazen spear Hurl'd at Meriones with ardent hope To pierce him, while, with nimble ????????? ???????????. A similar expression occurs in Book XIII. 158. There we read ????????? ??????????. Which is explained by the Scholiast in Villoisson to signify— advancing with quick short steps, and at the same time covering the feet with a shield. A practice which, unless they bore the ?????????? ??????, must necessarily leave the upper parts exposed. It is not improbable, though the translation is not accommodated to that conjecture, that Æneas, in his following speech to Meriones, calls him, ????????, with a view to the agility with which he performed this particular step in battle. steps and short Behind his buckler made, he paced the field; But, warn'd of its approach, Meriones Bow'd low his head, shunning it, and the spear Behind him pierced the soil; there quivering stood The weapon, vain, though from a vigorous arm, Till spent by slow degrees its fury slept. Two lines occurring here in the original which contain only the same matter as the two preceding, and which are found neither in the MSS. used by Barnes nor in the Harleian, the Translator has omitted them in his version as interpolated and superfluous. Indignant then Æneas thus exclaim'd. Meriones! I sent thee such a spear As, reaching thee, should have for ever marr'd Thy step, accomplish'd dancer as thou art. To whom Meriones spear-famed replied. Æneas! thou wilt find the labour hard How great soe'er thy might, to quell the force Of all opposers. Thou art also doom'd Thyself to die; and may but spear of mine Well-aim'd once strike thee full, what strength soe'er Or magnanimity be thine to boast, Thy glory in that moment thou resign'st To me, thy soul to Pluto steed-renown'd. He said, but him Patroclus sharp reproved. Why speaks Meriones, although in fight Approved, thus proudly? Nay, my gallant friend! The Trojans will not for reproach of ours Renounce the body. Blood must first be spilt. Tongues in debate, but hands in war decide; Deeds therefore now, not wordy vaunts, we need. So saying he led the way, whom follow'd close Godlike Meriones. As from the depth Of some lone wood that clothes the mountain's side The fellers at their toil are heard remote, So, from the face of Ilium's ample plain Reverberated, was the din of brass And of tough targets heard by faulchions huge Hard-smitten, and by spears of double-edge. None then, no, not the quickest to discern, Had known divine Sarpedon, from his head To his foot-sole with mingled blood and dust Polluted, and o'erwhelm'd with weapons. They Around the body swarm'd. As hovel-flies In spring-time buzz around the brimming pails With milk bedew'd, so they around the dead. Nor Jove averted once his glorious eyes From that dread contest, but with watchful note Mark'd all, the future death in battle deep Pondering of Patroclus, whether Him Hector should even now slay on divine Sarpedon, and despoil him of his arms, Or he should still that arduous strife prolong. This counsel gain'd as eligible most At length his preference: that the valiant friend Of Peleus' son should yet again compel The Trojan host with Hector brazen-mail'd To Ilium, slaughtering numerous by the way. First then, with fears unmanly he possess'd The heart of Hector; mounting to his seat He turn'd to flight himself, and bade his host Fly also; for he knew Jove's purpose ??? ???????—Voluntatem Jovis cui cedendum.—So it is interpreted in the Scholium MSS. Lipsiensis. —Vide Schaufelbergerus. changed. Thenceforth, no longer even Lycia's host Endured, but all fled scatter'd, seeing pierced Their sovereign through his heart, and heap'd with dead; For numerous, while Saturnian Jove the fight Held in suspense, had on his body fallen. At once the Greecians of his dazzling arms Despoil'd Sarpedon, which the Myrmidons By order of Menœtius' valiant son Bore thence into the fleet. Meantime his will The Thunderer to Apollo thus express'd. Phœbus, my son, delay not; from beneath Yon hill of weapons drawn cleanse from his blood Sarpedon's corse; then, bearing him remote, Lave him in waters of the running stream, With oils divine anoint, and in attire Immortal clothe him. Last, to Death and Sleep, Swift bearers both, twin-born, deliver him; For hence to Lycia's opulent abodes They shall transport him quickly, where, with rites Funereal, his next kindred and his friends Shall honour him, a pillar and a tomb (The dead man's portion) rearing to his name. He ceased; nor was Apollo slow to hear His father's will, but from the Idæan heights Descending swift into the dreadful field, Godlike Sarpedon's body from beneath The hill of weapons drew, which, borne remote, He laved in waters of the running stream, With oils ambrosial bathed, and clothed in robes Immortal. Then to Death and gentle Sleep, Swift-bearers both, twin-born, he gave the charge, Who placed it soon in Lycia's wealthy realm. Meantime Patroclus, calling to his steeds, And to Automedon, the Trojans chased And Lycians, on his own destruction bent Infatuate; heedless of his charge received From Peleus' son, which, well perform'd, had saved The Hero from his miserable doom. But Jove's high purpose evermore prevails Against the thoughts of man; He turns to flight The bravest, and the victory takes with ease E'en from the Chief whom he impels himself To battle, as he now this Chief impell'd. Who, then, Patroclus! first, who last by thee Fell slain, what time thyself wast call'd to die? Adrastus first, then Perimus he slew, Offspring of Megas, then Autonoüs, Echechlus, Melanippus, and Epistor, Pylartes, Mulius, Elasus. All these He slew, and from the field chased all beside. Then, doubtless, had Achaia's sons prevail'd To take proud-gated Troy, such havoc made He with his spear, but that the son of Jove Apollo, on a tower's conspicuous height Station'd, devoted him for Ilium's sake. Thrice on a buttress of the lofty wall Patroclus mounted, and him thrice the God With hands immortal his resplendent shield Smiting, struck down again; but when he rush'd A fourth time, demon-like, to the assault, The King of radiant shafts him, stern, rebuked. Patroclus, warrior of renown, retire! The fates ordain not that imperial Troy Stoop to thy spear, nor to the spear itself Of Peleus' son, though mightier far than thou. He said, and Menœtiades the wrath Of shaft-arm'd Phœbus shunning, far retired. But in the Scæan gate Hector his steeds Detain'd, uncertain whether thence to drive Amid the warring multitude again, Or, loud commandment issuing, to collect His host within the walls. Him musing long Apollo, clad in semblance of a Chief Youthful and valiant, join'd. Asius he seem'd Equestrian Hector's uncle, brother born Of Hecuba the queen, and Dymas' son, Who on the Sangar's banks in Phrygia dwelt. Apollo, so disguised, him thus bespake. Why, Hector, hast thou left the fight? this sloth Not well befits thee. Oh that I as far Thee pass'd in force as thou transcendest me, Then, not unpunish'd long, should'st thou retire; But haste, and with thy coursers solid-hoof'd Seek out Patroclus, him perchance to slay, Should Phœbus have decreed that glory thine. So saying, Apollo join'd the host again. Then noble Hector bade his charioteer Valiant Cebriones his coursers lash Back into battle, while the God himself Entering the multitude confounded sore The Argives, victory conferring proud And glory on Hector and the host of Troy. But Hector, leaving all beside unslain, Furious impell'd his coursers solid-hoof'd Against Patroclus; on the other side Patroclus from his chariot to the ground Leap'd ardent; in his left a spear he bore, And in his right a marble fragment rough, Large as his grasp. With full collected might He hurl'd it; neither was the weapon slow To find whom he had mark'd, or sent in vain. He smote the charioteer of Hector, bold Cebriones, King Priam's spurious son, Full on the forehead, while he sway'd the reins. The bone that force withstood not, but the rock With ragged points beset dash'd both his brows In pieces, and his eyes fell at his feet. He, diver-like, from his exalted stand Behind the steeds pitch'd headlong, and expired; O'er whom, Patroclus of equestrian fame! Thou didst exult with taunting speech severe. Ye Gods, with what agility he dives! Ah! it were well if in the fishy Deep This man were occupied; he might no few With oysters satisfy, although the waves Were churlish, plunging headlong from his bark As easily as from his chariot here. So then—in Troy, it seems, are divers too! So saying, on bold Cebriones he sprang With all a lion's force, who, while the folds He ravages, is wounded in the breast, And, victim of his own fierce courage, dies. So didst thou spring, Patroclus! to despoil Cebriones, and Hector opposite Leap'd also to the ground. Then contest such For dead Cebriones those two between Arose, as in the lofty mountain-tops Two lions wage, contending for a deer New-slain, both hunger-pinch'd and haughty both. So for Cebriones, alike in arms Expert, brave Hector and Patroclus strove To pierce each other with the ruthless spear. First, Hector seized his head, nor loosed his hold, Patroclus, next, his feet, while all beside Of either host in furious battle join'd. As when the East wind and the South contend To shake some deep wood on the mountain's side, Or beech, or ash, or rugged cornel old, With stormy violence the mingled boughs Smite and snap short each other, crashing loud; So, Trojans and Achaians, mingling, slew Mutual, while neither felt a wish to fly. Around Cebriones stood many a spear, And many a shaft sent smartly from the nerve Implanted deep, and many a stone of grasp Enormous sounded on their batter'd shields Who fought to gain him. He, in eddies lost Of sable dust, with his huge trunk huge space O'erspread, nor steeds nor chariots heeded more. While yet the sun ascending climb'd the heavens, Their darts flew equal, and the people fell; But when he westward journey'd, by a change Surpassing hope the Greecians then prevail'd. They drew Cebriones the Hero forth From all those weapons, and his armour stripp'd At leisure, distant from the battle's roar. Then sprang Patroclus on the Trojan host; Thrice, like another Mars, he sprang with shouts Tremendous, and nine warriors thrice he slew. But when the fourth time, dæmon-like, he rush'd Against them, then, oh then, too manifest The consummation of thy days approach'd Patroclus! whom Apollo terrour-clad Met then in battle. He the coming God Through all that multitude knew not, such gloom Impenetrable him involved around. Behind him close he stood, and with his palms Expanded on the spine and shoulders broad Smote him; his eyes swam dizzy at the stroke. Then Phœbus from his head his helmet dash'd To earth; sonorous at the feet it roll'd Of many a prancing steed, and all the crest Defilement gather'd gross of dust and blood, Then first; till then, impossible; for how Should dust the tresses of that helmet shame With which Achilles fighting fenced his head Illustrious, and his graceful brows divine? But Jove now made it Hector's; he awhile Bore it, himself to swift perdition doom'd. His spear brass-mounted, ponderous, huge and long, Fell shiver'd from his grasp. His shield that swept His ancle, with its belt dropp'd from his arm, And Phœbus loosed the corslet from his breast. Confusion seized his brain; his noble limbs Quaked under him, and panic-stunn'd he stood. Then came a Dardan Chief, who from behind Enforced a pointed lance into his back Between the shoulders; Panthus' son was he, Euphorbus, famous for equestrian skill, For spearmanship, and in the rapid race Past all of equal age. He twenty men (Although a learner yet of martial feats, And by his steeds then first to battle borne) Dismounted. He, Patroclus, mighty Chief! First threw a lance at thee, which yet thy life Quell'd not; then snatching hasty from the wound His ashen beam, he ran into the crowd, Nor dared confront in fight even the unarm'd Patroclus. But Patroclus, by the lance, And by the stroke of an immortal hand Subdued, fell back toward his ranks again. Then, soon as Hector the retreat perceived Of brave Patroclus wounded, issuing forth From his own phalanx, he approach'd and drove A spear right through his body at the waist. Sounding he fell. Loud groan'd Achaia's host. As when the lion and the sturdy boar Contend in battle on the mountain-tops For some scant rivulet, thirst-parch'd alike, Ere long the lion quells the panting boar; So Priameian Hector, spear in hand, Slew Menœtiades the valiant slayer Of multitudes, and thus in accents wing'd, With fierce delight exulted in his fall. It was thy thought, Patroclus, to have laid Our city waste, and to have wafted hence Our wives and daughters to thy native land, Their day of liberty for ever set. Fool! for their sakes the feet of Hector's steeds Fly into battle, and myself excel, For their sakes, all our bravest of the spear, That I may turn from them that evil hour Necessitous. But thou art vulture's food. Unhappy youth! all valiant as he is, Achilles hath no succour given to thee, Who when he sent thee forth whither himself Would not, thus doubtless gave thee oft in charge: Ah, well beware, Patroclus, glorious Chief! That thou revisit not these ships again, Till first on Hero-slaughterer Hector's breast Thou cleave his bloody corslet. So he spake, And with vain words thee credulous beguiled. To whom Patroclus, mighty Chief, with breath Drawn faintly, and dying, thou didst thus reply. Now, Hector, boast! now glory! for the son Of Saturn and Apollo, me with ease Vanquishing, whom they had themselves disarm'd, Have made the victory thine; else, twenty such As thou, had fallen by my victorious spear. Me Phœbus and my ruthless fate combined To slay; these foremost; but of mortal men Euphorbus, and thy praise is only third. I tell thee also, and within thy heart Repose it deep—Thou shalt not long survive; But, even now, fate, and a violent death Attend thee by Achilles' hands ordain'd To perish, by Æacides the brave. So saying, the shades of death him wrapp'd around. Down into Ades from his limbs dismiss'd, His spirit fled sorrowful, of youth's prime And vigorous manhood suddenly bereft. Then, him though dead, Hector again bespake. Patroclus! these prophetic strains of death At hand, and fate, why hast thou sung to me? May not the son of Thetis azure-hair'd, Achilles, perish first by spear of mine? He said; then pressing with his heel the trunk Supine, and backward thrusting it, he drew His glittering weapon from the wound, nor stay'd, But, lance in hand, the godlike charioteer Pursued of swift Æacides, on fire To smite Automedon; but him the steeds Immortal, rapid, by the Gods conferr'd (A glorious gift) on Peleus, snatch'd away. BOOK XVII. ARGUMENT OF THE SEVENTEENTH BOOK. Sharp contest ensues around the body of Patroclus. Hector puts on the armour of Achilles. Menelaus, having dispatched Antilochus to Achilles with news of the death of Patroclus, returns to the battle, and, together with Meriones, bears Patroclus off the field, while the Ajaces cover their retreat. Nor Menelaus, Atreus' valiant son, Knew not how Menœtiades had fallen By Trojan hands in battle; forth he rush'd All bright in burnish'd armour through his van, And as some heifer with maternal fears Now first acquainted, compasses around Her young one murmuring, with tender moan, So moved the Hero of the amber locks Around Patroclus, before whom his spear Advancing and broad shield, he death denounced On all opposers; neither stood the son Spear-famed of Panthus inattentive long To slain Patroclus, but approach'd the dead, And warlike Menelaus thus bespake. Prince! Menelaus! Atreus' mighty son! Yield. Leave the body and these gory spoils; For of the Trojans or allies of Troy None sooner made Patroclus bleed than I. Seek not to rob me, therefore, of my praise Among the Trojans, lest my spear assail Thee also, and thou perish premature. To whom, indignant, Atreus' son replied. Self-praise, the Gods do know, is little worth. But neither lion may in pride compare Nor panther, nor the savage boar whose heart's High temper flashes in his eyes, with these The spear-accomplish'd youths of Panthus' house. Yet Hyperenor of equestrian fame Lived not his lusty manhood to enjoy, Who scoffingly defied my force in arms, And call'd me most contemptible in fight Of all the Danaï. But him, I ween, His feet bore never hence to cheer at home His wife and parents with his glad return. So also shall thy courage fierce be tamed, If thou oppose me. I command thee, go— Mix with the multitude; withstand not me, Lest evil overtake thee! To be taught By sufferings only, is the part of fools. He said, but him sway'd not, who thus replied. Now, even now, Atrides! thou shalt rue My brother's blood which thou hast shed, and makest His death thy boast. Thou hast his blooming bride Widow'd, and thou hast fill'd his parents' hearts With anguish of unutterable woe; But bearing hence thy armour and thy head To Troy, and casting them at Panthus' feet, And at the feet of Phrontis, his espoused, I shall console the miserable pair. Nor will I leave that service unessay'd Longer, nor will I fail through want of force, Of courage, or of terrible address. He ceased, and smote his shield, nor pierced the disk, But bent his point against the stubborn brass. Then Menelaus, prayer preferring first To Jove, assail'd Euphorbus in his turn, Whom pacing backward in the throat he struck, And with both hands and his full force the spear Impelling, urged it through his neck behind. Sounding he fell; loud rang his batter'd arms. His locks, which even the Graces might have own'd, Blood-sullied, and his ringlets wound about With twine of gold and silver, swept the dust. As the luxuriant olive by a swain Rear'd in some solitude where rills abound, Puts forth her buds, and fann'd by genial airs On all sides, hangs her boughs with whitest flowers, But by a sudden whirlwind from its trench Uptorn, it lies extended on the field; Such, Panthus' warlike son Euphorbus seem'd, By Menelaus, son of Atreus, slain Suddenly, and of all his arms despoil'd. But as the lion on the mountains bred, Glorious in strength, when he hath seized the best And fairest of the herd, with savage fangs First breaks her neck, then laps the bloody paunch Torn wide; meantime, around him, but remote, Dogs stand and swains clamouring, yet by fear Repress'd, annoy him not or dare approach; So there all wanted courage to oppose The force of Menelaus, glorious Chief. Then, easily had Menelaus borne The armour of the son of Panthus thence, But that Apollo the illustrious prize Denied him, who in semblance of the Chief Of the Ciconians, Mentes, prompted forth Against him Hector terrible as Mars, Whose spirit thus in accents wing'd he roused. Hector! the chase is vain; here thou pursuest The horses of Æacides the brave, Which thou shalt never win, for they are steeds Of fiery nature, such as ill endure To draw or carry mortal man, himself Except, whom an immortal mother bore. Meantime, bold Menelaus, in defence Of dead Patroclus, hath a Trojan slain Of highest note, Euphorbus, Panthus' son, And hath his might in arms for ever quell'd So spake the God and to the fight return'd. But grief intolerable at that word Seized Hector; darting through the ranks his eye, He knew at once who stripp'd Euphorbus' arms, And Him knew also lying on the field, And from his wide wound bleeding copious still. Then dazzling-bright in arms, through all the van He flew, shrill-shouting, fierce as Vulcan's fire Unquenchable; nor were his shouts unheard By Atreus' son, who with his noble mind Conferring sad, thus to himself began. Alas! if I forsake these gorgeous spoils, And leave Patroclus for my glory slain, I fear lest the Achaians at that sight Incensed, reproach me; and if, urged by shame, I fight with Hector and his host, alone, Lest, hemm'd around by multitudes, I fall; For Hector, by his whole imbattled force Attended, comes. But whither tend my thoughts? No man may combat with another fenced By power divine and whom the Gods exalt, But he must draw down woe on his own head. Me, therefore, none of all Achaia's host Will blame indignant, seeing my retreat From Hector, whom themselves the Gods assist. But might the battle-shout of Ajax once Reach me, with force united we would strive, Even in opposition to a God, To rescue for Achilles' sake, his friend. Task arduous! but less arduous than this. While he thus meditated, swift advanced The Trojan ranks, with Hector at their head. He then, retiring slow, and turning oft, Forsook the body. As by dogs and swains With clamours loud and spears driven from the stalls A bearded lion goes, his noble heart Abhors retreat, and slow he quits the prey; So Menelaus with slow steps forsook Patroclus, and arrived in front, at length, Of his own phalanx, stood, with sharpen'd eyes Seeking vast Ajax, son of Telamon. Him leftward, soon, of all the field he mark'd Encouraging aloud his band, whose hearts With terrours irresistible himself Phœbus had fill'd. He ran, and at his side Standing, incontinent him thus bespake. My gallant Ajax, haste—come quickly—strive With me to rescue for Achilles' sake His friend, though bare, for Hector hath his arms. He said, and by his words the noble mind Of Ajax roused; issuing through the van He went, and Menelaus at his side. Hector the body of Patroclus dragg'd, Stript of his arms, with faulchion keen erelong Purposing to strike off his head, and cast His trunk, drawn distant, to the dogs of Troy. But Ajax, with broad shield tower-like, approach'd. Then Hector, to his bands retreating, sprang Into his chariot, and to others gave The splendid arms in charge, who into Troy Should bear the destined trophy of his praise. But Ajax with his broad shield guarding stood Slain Menœtiades, as for his whelps The lion stands; him through some forest drear Leading his little ones, the hunters meet; Fire glimmers in his looks, and down he draws His whole brow into frowns, covering his eyes; So, guarding slain Patroclus, Ajax lour'd. On the other side, with tender grief oppress'd Unspeakable, brave Menelaus stood. But Glaucus, leader of the Lycian band, Son of Hippolochus, in bitter terms Indignant, reprimanded Hector thus. Ah, Hector, Chieftain of excelling form, But all unfurnish'd with a warrior's heart! Unwarranted I deem thy great renown Who art to flight addicted. Think, henceforth, How ye shall save city and citadel Thou and thy people born in Troy, alone. No Lycian shall, at least, in your defence Fight with the Greecians, for our ceaseless toil In arms, hath ever been a thankless task. Inglorious Chief! how wilt thou save a worse From warring crowds, who hast Sarpedon left Thy guest, thy friend, to be a spoil, a prey To yonder Argives? While he lived he much Thee and thy city profited, whom dead Thou fear'st to rescue even from the dogs. Now, therefore, may but my advice prevail, Back to your country, Lycians! so, at once, Shall remediless ruin fall on Troy. For had the Trojans now a daring heart Intrepid, such as in the breast resides Of labourers in their country's dear behalf, We soon should drag Patroclus into Troy; And were his body, from the battle drawn, In Priam's royal city once secured, As soon, the Argives would in ransom give Sarpedon's body with his splendid arms To be conducted safe into the town. For when Patroclus fell, the friend was slain Of such a Chief as is not in the fleet For valour, and his bands are dauntless all. But thou, at the first glimpse of Ajax' eye Confounded, hast not dared in arms to face That warrior bold, superior far to thee. To whom brave Hector, frowning stern, replied. Why, Glaucus! should a Chief like thee his tongue Presume to employ thus haughtily? My friend! I thee accounted wisest, once, of all Who dwell in fruitful Lycia, but thy speech Now utter'd altogether merits blame, In which thou tell'st me that I fear to stand Against vast Ajax. Know that I from fight Shrink not, nor yet from sound of prancing steeds; But Jove's high purpose evermore prevails Against the thoughts of man; he turns to flight The bravest, and the victory takes with ease Even from those whom once he favour'd most. But hither, friend! stand with me; mark my deed; Prove me, if I be found, as thou hast said, An idler all the day, or if by force I not compel some Greecian to renounce Patroclus, even the boldest of them all. He ceased, and to his host exclaim'd aloud. Trojans, and Lycians, and close-fighting sons Of Dardanus, oh be ye men, my friends! Now summon all your fortitude, while I Put on the armour of Achilles, won From the renown'd Patroclus slain by me. So saying, illustrious Hector from the clash Of spears withdrew, and with his swiftest pace Departing, overtook, not far remote, The bearers of Achilles' arms to Troy. Apart from all the horrors of the field Standing, he changed his armour; gave his own To be by them to sacred Ilium borne, And the immortal arms of Peleus' son Achilles, by the ever-living Gods To Peleus given, put on. Those arms the Sire, Now old himself, had on his son conferr'd, But in those arms his son grew never old. Him, therefore, soon as cloud-assembler Jove Saw glittering in divine Achilles' arms, Contemplative he shook his brows, and said. Ah hapless Chief! thy death, although at hand, Nought troubles thee. Thou wear'st his heavenly arms, Who all excels, terrour of Ilium's host. His friend, though bold yet gentle, thou hast slain, And hast the brows and bosom of the dead Unseemly bared: yet, bright success awhile I give thee; so compensating thy lot, From whom Andromache shall ne'er receive Those glorious arms, for thou shalt ne'er return. So spake the Thunderer, and his sable brows Shaking, confirm'd the word. But Hector found The armour apt; the God of war his soul With fury fill'd, he felt his limbs afresh Invigorated, and with loudest shouts Return'd to his illustrious allies. To them he seem'd, clad in those radiant arms, Himself Achilles; rank by rank he pass'd Through all the host, exhorting every Chief, Asteropæus, Mesthles, Phorcys, Medon, Thersilochus, Deisenor, augur Ennomus, Chromius, Hippothoüs; all these he roused To battle, and in accents wing'd began. Hear me, ye myriads, neighbours and allies! For not through fond desire to fill the plain With multitudes, have I convened you here Each from his city, but that well-inclined To Ilium, ye might help to guard our wives And little ones against the host of Greece. Therefore it is that forage large and gifts Providing for you, I exhaust the stores Of Troy, and drain our people for your sake. Turn then direct against them, and his life Save each, or lose; it is the course of war. Him who shall drag, though dead, Patroclus home Into the host of Troy, and shall repulse Ajax, I will reward with half the spoils, And half shall be my own; glory and praise Shall also be his meed, equal to mine. He ended; they compact with lifted spears Bore on the Danaï, conceiving each Warm expectation in his heart to wrest From Ajax son of Telamon, the dead. Vain hope! he many a lifeless Trojan heap'd On slain Patroclus, but at length his speech To warlike Menelaus thus address'd. Ah, Menelaus, valiant friend! I hope No longer, now, that even we shall 'scape Ourselves from fight; nor fear I so the loss Of dead Patroclus, who shall soon the dogs Of Ilium, and the fowls sate with his flesh, As for my life I tremble and for thine, That cloud of battle, Hector, such a gloom Sheds all around; death manifest impends. Haste—call our best, if even they can hear. He spake, nor Menelaus not complied, But call'd aloud on all the Chiefs of Greece. Friends, senators, and leaders of the powers Of Argos! who with Agamemnon drink And Menelaus at the public feast, Each bearing rule o'er many, by the will Of Jove advanced to honour and renown! The task were difficult to single out Chief after Chief by name amid the blaze Of such contention; but oh come yourselves Indignant forth, nor let the dogs of Troy Patroclus rend, and gambol with his bones! He ceased, whom Oiliades the swift Hearing incontinent, of all the Chiefs Ran foremost, after whom Idomeneus Approach'd, and dread as homicidal Mars Meriones. But never mind of man Could even in silent recollection name The whole vast multitude who, following these, Renew'd the battle on the part of Greece. The Trojans first, with Hector at their head, Wedged in close phalanx, rush'd to the assault. As when within some rapid river's mouth The billows and stream clash, on either shore There is no word in our language expressive of loud sound at all comparable in effect to the Greek Bo-o-osin. I have therefore endeavoured by the juxtaposition of two words similar in sound, to palliate in some degree a defect which it was not in my power to cure. Loud sounds the roar There is no word in our language expressive of loud sound at all comparable in effect to the Greek Bo-o-osin. I have therefore endeavoured by the juxtaposition of two words similar in sound, to palliate in some degree a defect which it was not in my power to cure. of waves ejected wide, Such seem'd the clamours of the Trojan host. But the Achaians, one in heart, around Patroclus stood, bulwark'd with shields of brass, And over all their glittering helmets Jove Darkness diffused, for he had loved Patroclus While yet he lived friend of Æacides, And, now, abhorring that the dogs of Troy Should eat him, urged the Greeks to his defence. The host of Troy first shook the Greecian host; The body left, they fled; yet of them all, The Trojan powers, determined as they were, Slew none, but dragg'd the body. Neither stood The Greeks long time aloof, soon as repulsed Again led on by Ajax, who in form And in exploits all others far excell'd, Peerless Æacides alone except. Right through the foremost combatants he rush'd, In force resembling most some savage boar That in the mountains bursting through the brakes, The swains disperses and their hounds with ease; Like him, illustrious Ajax, mighty son Of Telamon, at his assault dispersed With ease the close imbattled ranks, who fought Around Patroclus' body, strong in hope To atchieve it, and to make the glory theirs. Hippothoüs, a youth of high renown, Son of Pelasgian Lethus, by a noose Around his ancle cast dragg'd through the fight Patroclus, so to gratify the host Of Ilium and their Chief; but evil him Reach'd suddenly, by none of all his friends (Though numerous wish'd to save him) turn'd aside. For swift advancing on him through the crowd The son of Telamon pierced, spear in hand, His helmet brazen-cheek'd; the crested casque, So smitten, open'd wide, for huge the hand And ponderous was the spear that gave the blow, And all around its neck, mingled with blood Gush'd forth the brain. There, lifeless, down he sank, Let fall the Hero's foot, and fell himself Prone on the dead, never to see again Deep-soil'd Larissa, never to requite Their kind solicitudes who gave him birth, In bloom of life by dauntless Ajax slain. Then, Hector hurl'd at Ajax his bright spear, But he, forewarn'd of its approach, escaped Narrowly, and it pierced Schedius instead, Brave son of Iphitus; he, noblest Chief Of the Phocensians, over many reign'd, Dwelling in Panopeus the far-renown'd. Entering beneath the clavicle Or collar-bone. the point Right through his shoulder's summit pass'd behind, And on his loud-resounding arms he fell. But Ajax at his waist wounded the son Of Phœnops, valiant Phorcys, while he stood Guarding Hippothöus; through his hollow mail Enforced the weapon drank his inmost life, And in his palm, supine, he clench'd the dust. Then, Hector with the foremost Chiefs of Troy Fell back; the Argives sent a shout to heaven, And dragging Phorcys and Hippothöus thence Stripp'd both. In that bright moment Ilium's host Fear-quell'd before Achaia's warlike sons Had Troy re-enter'd, and the host of Greece By matchless might and fortitude their own Had snatch'd a victory from the grasp of Fate, But that, himself, the King of radiant shafts Æneas roused; Epytis' son he seem'd Periphas, ancient in the service grown Of old Anchises whom he dearly loved; His form assumed, Apollo thus began. How could ye save, Æneas, were the Gods Your enemies, the towers of lofty Troy? As I have others seen, warriors who would, Men fill'd with might and valour, firm themselves And Chiefs of multitudes disdaining fear. But Jove to us the victory far more Than to the Greecians wills; therefore the fault Is yours, who tremble and refuse the fight. He ended, whom Æneas marking, knew At once the glorious Archer of the skies, And thus to distant Hector call'd aloud. Oh, Hector, and ye other Chiefs of Troy And of her brave confederates! Shame it were Should we re-enter Ilium, driven to flight By dastard fear before the host of Greece. A God assured me even now, that Jove, Supreme in battle, gives his aid to Troy. Rush, therefore, on the Danaï direct, Nor let them, safe at least and unannoy'd, Bear hence Patroclus' body to the fleet. He spake, and starting far into the van Stood foremost forth; they, wheeling, faced the Greeks. Then, spear in hand, Æneas smote the friend Of Lycomedes, brave Leocritus, Son of Arisbas. Lycomedes saw Compassionate his death, and drawing nigh First stood, then hurling his resplendent lance, Right through the liver Apisaon pierced Offspring of Hippasus, his chest beneath, And, lifeless, instant, on the field he fell. He from Pæonia the deep-soil'd to Troy Came forth, Asteropæus sole except, Bravest of all Pæonia's band in arms. Asteropæus saw, and to the van Sprang forth for furious combat well prepared, But room for fight found none, so thick a fence Of shields and ported spears fronted secure The phalanx guarding Menœtiades. For Ajax ranging all the ranks, aloud Admonish'd them that no man yielding ground Should leave Patroclus, or advance before The rest, but all alike fight and stand fast. Such order gave huge Ajax; purple gore Drench'd all the ground; in slaughter'd heaps they fell Trojans and Trojan aids of dauntless hearts And Greecians; for not even they the fight Waged bloodless, though with far less cost of blood, Each mindful to avert his fellow's fate. Thus burn'd the battle; neither hadst thou deem'd The sun himself in heaven unquench'd, or moon, Beneath a cope so dense of darkness strove Unceasing all the most renown'd in arms For Menœtiades. Meantime the war, Wherever else, the bright-arm'd Greecians waged And Trojans under skies serene. The sun On them his radiance darted; not a cloud, From mountain or from vale rising, allay'd His fervour; there at distance due they fought And paused by turns, and shunn'd the cruel dart. But in the middle field not war alone They suffer'd, but night also; ruthless raged The iron storm, and all the mightiest bled. Two glorious Chiefs, the while, Antilochus And Thrasymedes, had no tidings heard Of brave Patroclus slain, but deem'd him still Living, and troubling still the host of Troy; For watchful The proper meaning of ???????????—is not simply looking on, but providing against. And thus their ignorance of the death of Patroclus is accounted for. They were ordered by Nestor to a post in which they should have little to do themselves, except to superintend others, and were consequently too remote from Patroclus to see him fall, or even to hear that he had fallen. —See Villoisson. only to prevent the flight Or slaughter of their fellow-warriors, they Maintain'd a distant station, so enjoin'd By Nestor when he sent them to the field. But fiery conflict arduous employ'd The rest all day continual; knees and legs Feet, hands, and eyes of those who fought to guard The valiant friend of swift Æacides Sweat gather'd foul and dust. As when a man An huge ox-hide drunken with slippery lard Gives to be stretch'd, his servants all around Disposed, just intervals between, the task Ply strenuous, and while many straining hard Extend it equal on all sides, it sweats The moisture out, and drinks the unction in, So they, in narrow space struggling, the dead Dragg'd every way, warm hope conceiving, these To drag him thence to Troy, those, to the ships. Wild tumult raged around him; neither Mars, Gatherer of hosts to battle, nor herself Pallas, however angry, had beheld That conflict with disdain, Jove to such length Protracted on that day the bloody toil Of steeds and men for Menœtiades. Nor knew divine Achilles or had aught Heard of Patroclus slain, for from the ships Remote they fought, beneath the walls of Troy. He, therefore, fear'd not for his death, but hope Indulged much rather, that, the battle push'd To Ilium's gates, he should return alive. For that his friend, unaided by himself Or even aided, should prevail to lay Troy waste, he nought supposed; by Thetis warn'd In secret conference oft, he better knew Jove's purpose; yet not even she had borne Those dreadful tidings to his ear, the loss Immeasurable of his dearest friend. They all around the dead fought spear in hand With mutual slaughter ceaseless, and amid Achaia's host thus spake a Chief mail-arm'd. Shame were it, Greecians! should we seek by flight Our galleys now; yawn earth our feet beneath And here ingulf us rather! Better far Than to permit the steed-famed host of Troy To drag Patroclus hence into the town, And make the glory of this conflict theirs. Thus also of the dauntless Trojans spake A certain warrior. Oh, my friends! although The Fates ordain us, one and all, to die Around this body, stand! quit not the field. So spake the warrior prompting into act The courage of his friends, and such they strove On both sides; high into the vault of heaven The iron din pass'd through the desart air. Meantime the horses of Æacides From fight withdrawn, soon as they understood Their charioteer fallen in the dust beneath The arm of homicidal Hector, wept. Them oft with hasty lash Diores' son Automedon impatient smote, full oft He stroked them gently, and as oft he chode This is the proper imperfect of the verb chide, though modern usage has substituted chid, a word of mean and awkward sound, in the place of it.; Yet neither to the fleet ranged on the shore Of spacious Hellespont would they return, Nor with the Greecians seek the fight, but stood As a sepulchral pillar stands, unmoved Between their traces; to the earth they hung Their heads, with plenteous tears their driver mourn'd, And mingled their dishevell'd manes with dust. Jove saw their grief with pity, and his brows Shaking, within himself thus, pensive, said. Ah hapless pair! Wherefore by gift divine Were ye to Peleus given, a mortal king, Yourselves immortal and from age exempt? Was it that ye might share in human woes? For, of all things that breathe or creep the earth, No creature lives so mere a wretch as man. Yet shall not Priameian Hector ride Triumphant, drawn by you. Myself forbid. Suffice it that he boasts vain-gloriously Those arms his own. Your spirit and your limbs I will invigorate, that ye may bear Safe hence Automedon into the fleet. For I ordain the Trojans still to spread Carnage around victorious, till they reach The gallant barks, and till the sun at length Descending, sacred darkness cover all. He said, and with new might the steeds inspired. They, shaking from their hair profuse the dust, Between the van of either army whirl'd The rapid chariot. Fighting as he pass'd, Though fill'd with sorrow for his slaughter'd friend, Automedon high-mounted swept the field Impetuous as a vulture scattering geese; Now would he vanish, and now, turn'd again, Chace through a multitude his trembling foe; But whomsoe'er he follow'd, none he slew, Nor was the task possible to a Chief Sole in the sacred chariot, both to aim The spear aright and guide the fiery steeds. At length Alcimedon, his friend in arms, Son of Laerceus son of Æmon, him Observing, from behind the chariot hail'd The flying warrior, whom he thus bespake. What power, Automedon! hath ta'en away Thy better judgement, and thy breast inspired With this vain purpose to assail alone The Trojan van? Thy partner in the fight Is slain, and Hector on his shoulders bears, Elate, the armour of Æacides. Then, answer thus Automedon return'd, Son of Diores. Who of all our host Was ever skill'd, Alcimedon! as thou To rule the fire of these immortal steeds, Save only while he lived, peer of the Gods In that great art, Patroclus, now no more? Thou, therefore, the resplendent reins receive And scourge, while I, dismounting, wage the fight. He ceased; Alcimedon without delay The battle-chariot mounting, seized at once The lash and reins, and from his seat down leap'd Automedon. Them noble Hector mark'd, And to Æneas at his side began. Illustrious Chief of Trojans brazen-mail'd Æneas! I have noticed yonder steeds Of swift Achilles rushing into fight Conspicuous, but under sway of hands Unskilful; whence arises a fair hope That we might seize them, wert thou so inclined; For never would those two dare to oppose In battle an assault dreadful as ours. He ended, nor the valiant son refused Of old Anchises, but with targets firm Of season'd hide brass-plated thrown athwart Their shoulders, both advanced direct, with whom Of godlike form Aretus also went And Chromius. Ardent hope they all conceived To slay those Chiefs, and from the field to drive Achilles' lofty steeds. Vain hope! for them No bloodless strife awaited with the force Of brave Automedon; he, prayer to Jove First offering, felt his angry soul with might Heroic fill'd, and thus his faithful friend Alcimedon, incontinent, address'd. Alcimedon! hold not the steeds remote But breathing on my back; for I expect That never Priameïan Hector's rage Shall limit know, or pause, till, slaying us, He shall himself the coursers ample-maned Mount of Achilles, and to flight compel The Argive host, or perish in the van. So saying, he call'd aloud on Menelaus With either Ajax. Oh, illustrious Chiefs Of Argos, Menelaus, and ye bold Ajaces The Latin plural of Ajax is sometimes necessary, because the English plural—Ajaxes—would be insupportable.! leaving all your best to cope With Ilium's powers and to protect the dead, From friends still living ward the bitter day. For hither borne, two Chiefs, bravest of all The Trojans, Hector and Æneas rush Right through the battle. The events of war Heaven orders; therefore even I will give My spear its flight, and Jove dispose the rest! He said, and brandishing his massy spear Dismiss'd it at Aretus; full he smote His ample shield, nor stay'd the pointed brass, But penetrating sheer the disk, his belt Pierced also, and stood planted in his waist. As when some vigorous youth with sharpen'd axe A pastured bullock smites behind the horns And hews the muscle through; he, at the stroke Springs forth and falls, so sprang Aretus forth, Then fell supine, and in his bowels stood The keen-edged lance still quivering till he died. Then Hector, in return, his radiant spear Hurl'd at Automedon, who of its flight Forewarn'd, his body bowing prone, the stroke Eluded, and the spear piercing the soil Behind him, shook to its superior end, Till, spent by slow degrees, its fury slept. And now, with hand to hilt, for closer war Both stood prepared, when through the multitude Advancing at their fellow-warrior's call, The Ajaces suddenly their combat fierce Prevented. Awed at once by their approach Hector retired, with whom Æneas went Also and godlike Chromius, leaving there Aretus with his vitals torn, whose arms, Fierce as the God of war Automedon Stripp'd off, and thus exulted o'er the slain. My soul some portion of her grief resigns Consoled, although by slaughter of a worse, For loss of valiant Menœtiades. So saying, within his chariot he disposed The gory spoils, then mounted it himself With hands and feet purpled, as from a bull His bloody prey, some lion newly-gorged. And now around Patroclus raged again Dread strife deplorable; for from the skies Descending at the Thunderer's command Whose purpose now was to assist the Greeks, Pallas enhanced the fury of the fight. As when from heaven, in view of mortals, Jove Exhibits bright his bow, a sign ordain'd Of war, or numbing frost which all the works Suspends of man and saddens all the flocks; So she, all mantled with a radiant cloud Entering Achaia's host, fired every breast. But meeting Menelaus first, brave son Of Atreus, in the form and with the voice Robust of Phœnix, him she thus bespake. Shame, Menelaus, shall to thee redound For ever, and reproach, should dogs devour The faithful friend of Peleus' noble son Under Troy's battlements; but stand, thyself, Undaunted, and encourage all the host. To whom the son of Atreus bold in arms. Ah, Phœnix, friend revered, ancient and sage! Would Pallas give me might and from the dint Shield me of dart and spear, with willing mind I would defend Patroclus, for his death Hath touch'd me deep. But Hector with the rage Burns of consuming fire, nor to his spear Gives pause, for him Jove leads to victory. He ceased, whom Pallas, Goddess azure-eyed Hearing, rejoiced that of the heavenly powers He had invoked her foremost to his aid. His shoulders with new might, and limbs she fill'd, And persevering boldness to his breast Imparted, such as prompts the fly, which oft From flesh of man repulsed, her purpose yet To bite holds fast, resolved on human blood. His stormy bosom with such courage fill'd By Pallas, to Patroclus he approach'd And hurl'd, incontinent, his glittering spear. There was a Trojan Chief, Podes by name, Son of Eëtion, valorous and rich; Of all Troy's citizens him Hector most Respected, in convivial pleasures sweet His chosen companion. As he sprang to flight, The hero of the golden locks his belt Struck with full force and sent the weapon through. Sounding he fell, and from the Trojan ranks Atrides dragg'd the body to his own. Then drew Apollo near to Hector's side, And in the form of Phœnops, Asius' son, Of all the foreign guests at Hector's board His favourite most, the hero thus address'd. What Chief of all the Greecians shall henceforth Fear Hector, who from Menelaus shrinks Once deem'd effeminate, but dragging now The body of thy valiant friend approved Whom he hath slain, Podes, Eëtion's son? He spake, and at his words grief like a cloud Involved the mind of Hector dark around; Right through the foremost combatants he rush'd All clad in dazzling brass. Then, lifting high His tassel'd ægis radiant, Jove with storms Enveloped Ida; flash'd his lightnings, roar'd His thunders, and the mountain shook throughout. Troy's host he prosper'd, and the Greeks dispersed. First fled Peneleus, the Bœotian Chief, Whom facing firm the foe Polydamas Struck on his shoulder's summit with a lance Hurl'd nigh at hand, which slight inscribed the bone. Leïtus was another Chief of the Bœotians.Leïtus also, son of the renown'd Alectryon, pierced by Hector in the wrist, Disabled left the fight; trembling he fled And peering narrowly around, nor hoped To lift a spear against the Trojans more. Hector, pursuing Leïtus, the point Encounter'd of the brave Idomeneus Full on his chest; but in his mail the lance Snapp'd, and the Trojans shouted to the skies. He, in his turn, cast at Deucalion's son Idomeneus, who in that moment gain'd ????? ??????????—Yet we learn soon after that he fought on foot. But the Scholiast explains the expression thus—????? ?? ????? ?????????. The fact was that Idomeneus had left the camp on foot, and was on foot when Hector prepared to throw at him. But Cœranus, charioteer of Meriones, observing his danger, drove instantly to his aid. Idomeneus had just time to mount, and the spear designed for him, struck Cœranus. —For a right understanding of this very intricate and difficult passage, I am altogether indebted to the Scholiast as quoted by Villoisson. A chariot-seat; but him the erring spear Attain'd not, piercing Cœranus instead The friend and follower of Meriones From wealthy Lyctus, and his charioteer. For when he left, that day, the gallant barks Idomeneus had sought the field on foot, And triumph proud, full sure, to Ilium's host Had yielded now, but that with rapid haste Cœranus drove to his relief, from him The fate averting which himself incurr'd Victim of Hector's homicidal arm. Him Hector smiting between ear and jaw, Push'd from their sockets with the lance's point His firm-set teeth, and sever'd sheer his tongue. Dismounted down he fell, and from his hand Let slide the flowing reins, which, to the earth Stooping, Meriones in haste resumed, And briefly thus Idomeneus address'd. Now drive, and cease not, to the fleet of Greece! Thyself see'st victory no longer ours. He said; Idomeneus whom, now, dismay Seized also, with his lash plying severe The coursers ample-maned, flew to the fleet. Nor Ajax, dauntless hero, not perceived, Nor Menelaus, by the sway of Jove The victory inclining fast to Troy, And thus the Telamonian Chief began. Ah! who can be so blind as not to see The eternal Father, now, with his own hand Awarding glory to the Trojan host, Whose every spear flies, instant, to the mark Sent forth by brave or base? Jove guides them all; While, ineffectual, ours fall to the ground. But haste, devise we of ourselves the means How likeliest we may bear Patroclus hence, And gladden, safe returning, all our friends, Who, hither looking anxious, hope have none That we shall longer check the unconquer'd force Of hero-slaughtering Hector, but expect The Translator here follows the interpretation preferred by the Scholiast. The original expression is ambiguous, and may signify, either, that we shall perish in the fleet ourselves, or that Hector will soon be in the midst of it. Vide Villoisson in loco.To see him soon amid the fleet of Greece. Oh for some Greecian now to carry swift The tidings to Achilles' ear, untaught, As I conjecture, yet, the doleful news Of his Patroclus slain! but no such Greek May I discern, such universal gloom Both men and steeds envelopes all around. Father of heaven and earth! deliver thou Achaia's host from darkness; clear the skies; Give day; and (since thy sovereign will is such) Destruction with it—but oh give us day! He spake, whose tears Jove saw with pity moved, And chased the untimely shades; bright beam'd the sun And the whole battle was display'd. Then spake The hero thus to Atreus' mighty son. Now noble Menelaus! looking forth, See if Antilochus be yet alive, Brave son of Nestor, whom exhort to fly With tidings to Achilles, of the friend Whom most he loved, of his Patroclus slain. He ceased, nor Menelaus, dauntless Chief, That task refused, but went; yet neither swift Nor willing. As a lion leaves the stalls Wearied himself with harassing the guard, Who, interdicting him his purposed prey, Watch all the night; he famish'd, yet again Comes furious on, but speeds not, kept aloof By spears from daring hands dismiss'd, but more By flash of torches which, though fierce, he dreads, Till at the dawn, sullen he stalks away; So from Patroclus Menelaus went Heroic Chief! reluctant; for he fear'd Lest the Achaians should resign the dead, Through consternation, to the host of Troy. Departing, therefore, he admonish'd oft Meriones and the Ajaces, thus. Ye two brave leaders of the Argive host, And thou, Meriones! now recollect The gentle manners of Patroclus fallen Hapless in battle, who by carriage mild Well understood, while yet he lived, to engage All hearts, though prisoner now of death and fate. So saying, the Hero amber-hair'd his steps Turn'd thence, the field exploring with an eye Sharp as the eagle's, of all fowls beneath The azure heavens for keenest sight renown'd, Whom, though he soar sublime, the leveret By broadest leaves conceal'd 'scapes not, but swift Descending, even her he makes his prey; So, noble Menelaus! were thine eyes Turn'd into every quarter of the host In search of Nestor's son, if still he lived. Him, soon, encouraging his band to fight, He noticed on the left of all the field, And sudden standing at his side, began. Antilochus! oh hear me, noble friend! And thou shalt learn tidings of such a deed As best had never been. Thou know'st, I judge, And hast already seen, how Jove exalts To victory the Trojan host, and rolls Distress on ours; but ah! Patroclus lies, Our chief Achaian, slain, whose loss the Greeks Fills with regret. Haste, therefore, to the fleet, Inform Achilles; bid him haste to save, If save he can, the body of his friend; He can no more, for Hector hath his arms. He ceased. Antilochus with horror heard Those tidings; mute long time he stood, his eyes Swam tearful, and his voice, sonorous erst, Found utterance none. Yet even so distress'd, He not the more neglected the command Of Menelaus. Setting forth to run, He gave his armour to his noble friend Laodocus, who thither turn'd his steeds, And, weeping as he went, on rapid feet Sped to Achilles with that tale of woe. Nor could the noble Menelaus stay To give the weary Pylian band, bereft Of their beloved Antilochus, his aid, But leaving them to Thrasymedes' care, He flew to Menœtiades again, And the Ajaces, thus, instant bespake. He goes. I have dispatch'd him to the fleet To seek Achilles; but his coming nought Expect I now, although with rage he burn Against illustrious Hector; for what fight Can he, unarm'd, against the Trojans wage? Deliberating, therefore, frame we means How best to save Patroclus, and to 'scape Ourselves unslain from this disastrous field. Whom answer'd the vast son of Telamon. Most noble Menelaus! good is all Which thou hast spoken. Lift ye from the earth Thou and Meriones, at once, and bear The dead Patroclus from the bloody field. To cope meantime with Hector and his host Shall be our task, who, one in name, nor less In spirit one, already have the brunt Of much sharp conflict, side by side, sustain'd. He ended; they enfolding in their arms The dead, upbore him high above the ground With force united; after whom the host Of Troy, seeing the body borne away, Shouted, and with impetuous onset all Follow'd them. As the hounds, urged from behind By youthful hunters, on the wounded boar Make fierce assault; awhile at utmost speed They stretch toward him, hungering for the prey, But oft as, turning sudden, the stout brawn Faces them, scatter'd on all sides escape; The Trojans so, thick thronging in the rear, Ceaseless with faulchions and spears double-edged Annoy'd them sore, but oft as in retreat The dauntless Heroes, the Ajaces turn'd To face them, deadly wan grew every cheek, And not a Trojan dared with onset rude Molest them more in conflict for the dead. Thus they, laborious, forth from battle bore Patroclus to the fleet, tempestuous war Their steps attending, rapid as the flames Which, kindled suddenly, some city waste; Consumed amid the blaze house after house Sinks, and the wind, meantime, roars through the fire; So them a deafening tumult as they went Pursued, of horses and of men spear-arm'd. And as two mules with strength for toil endued, Draw through rough ways down from the distant hills Huge timber, beam or mast; sweating they go, And overlabour'd to faint weariness; So they the body bore, while, turning oft, The Ajaces check'd the Trojans. As a mound Planted with trees and stretch'd athwart the mead Repels an overflow; the torrents loud Baffling, it sends them far away to float The level land, nor can they with the force Of all their waters burst a passage through; So the Ajaces, constant, in the rear Repress'd the Trojans; but the Trojans them Attended still, of whom Æneas most Troubled them, and the glorious Chief of Troy. They as a cloud of starlings or of daws Fly screaming shrill, warn'd timely of the kite Or hawk, devourers of the smaller kinds, So they shrill-clamouring toward the fleet, Hasted before Æneas and the might Of Hector, nor the battle heeded more. Much radiant armour round about the foss Fell of the flying Greecians, or within Lay scatter'd, and no pause of war they found. BOOK XVIII. ARGUMENT OF THE EIGHTEENTH BOOK. Achilles, by command of Juno, shows himself to the Trojans, who fly at his appearance; Vulcan, at the instance of Thetis, forges for him a suit of armour. Thus burn'd the battle like devouring fire. Meantime, Antilochus with rapid steps Came to Achilles. Him he found before His lofty barks, occupied, as he stood, With boding fears of all that had befall'n. He groan'd, and to his noble self he said, Ah! woe is me—why falls Achaia's host, With such disorder foul, back on the fleet? I tremble lest the Gods my anxious thoughts Accomplish and my mother's words, who erst Hath warn'd me, that the bravest and the best Of all my Myrmidons, while yet I live, Slain under Troy, must view the sun no more. Brave Menœtiades is, doubtless, slain. Unhappy friend! I bade thee oft, our barks Deliver'd once from hostile fires, not seek To cope in arms with Hector, but return. While musing thus he stood, the son approach'd Of noble Nestor, and with tears his cheeks Bedewing copious, his sad message told. Oh son of warlike Peleus! thou shalt hear Tidings of deeds which best had never been. Patroclus is no more. The Greecians fight For his bare corse, and Hector hath his arms. Then clouds of sorrow fell on Peleus' son, And, grasping with both hands the ashes, down He pour'd them on his head, his graceful brows Dishonouring, and thick the sooty shower Descending settled on his fragrant vest. Then, stretch'd in ashes, at the vast extent Of his whole length he lay, disordering wild With his own hands, and rending off his hair. The maidens, captived by himself in war And by Patroclus, shrieking from the tent Ran forth, and hemm'd the glorious Chief around. All smote their bosoms, and all, fainting, fell. On the other side, Antilochus the hands Held of Achilles, mourning and deep groans Uttering from his noble heart, through fear Lest Peleus' son should perish self-destroy'd. Loud groan'd the Hero, whose loud groans within The gulfs of ocean, where she sat beside Her ancient Sire, his Goddess-mother heard, And hearing shriek'd; around, her at the voice Assembled all the Nereids of the Deep. Cymodoce, Thalia, Glauca came, Nisæa, Spio, Thoa, and with eyes Protuberant beauteous Halia; came with these Cymothöe, and Actæa, and the nymph Of marshes, Limnorea, nor delay'd Agave, nor Amphithöe the swift, Iæra, Doto, Melita, nor thence Was absent Proto or Dynamene, Callianira, Doris, Panope, Pherusa or Amphinome, or fair Dexamene, or Galatea praised For matchless form divine; Nemertes pure Came also, with Apseudes chrystal-bright, Callianassa, Mæra, Clymene, Janeira and Janassa, sister pair, And Orithya, and with azure locks Luxuriant, Amathea; nor alone Came these, but every ocean-nymph beside. The silver cave was fill'd; each smote her breast, And Thetis, loud lamenting, thus began. Ye sister Nereids, hear! that ye may all From my own lips my boundless sorrow learn. Ah me forlorn! ah me, parent in vain Of an illustrious birth! who, having borne A noble son magnanimous, the chief Of Heroes, saw him like a thriving plant Shoot vigorous under my maternal care, And sent him early in his gallant fleet Embark'd, to combat with the sons of Troy. But him from fight return'd I shall receive Beneath the roof of Peleus, never more; And while he lives, and on the sun his eyes Opens, he mourns, nor, going, can I aught Assist him; yet I go, that I may see My darling son, and from his lips be taught What grief hath now befallen him, who close Abiding in his tent shares not the war. So saying she left the cave, whom all her nymphs Attended weeping, and where'er they pass'd The breaking billows open'd wide a way. At fruitful Troy arrived, in order fair They climb'd the beach, where by his numerous barks Encompass'd, swift Achilles sighing lay. Then, drawing nigh to her afflicted son, The Goddess-mother press'd between her palms His temples, and in accents wing'd enquired. Why weeps my son? what sorrow wrings thy soul? Speak, hide it not. Jove hath fulfill'd the prayer Which erst with lifted hands thou didst prefer, That all Achaia's host, wanting thy aid, Might be compell'd into the fleet, and foul Disgrace incur, there prison'd for thy sake. To whom Achilles, groaning deep, replied. My mother! it is true; Olympian Jove That prayer fulfils; but thence, what joy to me, Patroclus slain? the friend of all my friends Whom most I loved, dear to me as my life— Him I have lost. Slain and despoil'd he lies By Hector of his glorious armour bright The wonder of all eyes, a matchless gift Given by the Gods to Peleus on that day When thee they doom'd into a mortal's arms. Oh that with these thy deathless ocean-nymphs Dwelling content, thou hadst my father left To espouse a mortal bride, so hadst thou 'scaped Pangs numberless which thou must now endure For thy son's death, whom thou shalt never meet From Troy return'd, in Peleus' mansion more! For life I covet not, nor longer wish To mix with human kind, unless my spear May find out Hector, and atonement take By slaying Him, for my Patroclus slain. To whom, with streaming tears, Thetis replied. Swift comes thy destiny as thou hast said, For after Hector's death thine next ensues. Then answer, thus, indignant he return'd. Death seize me now! since when my friend was slain, My doom was, not to succour him. He died From home remote, and wanting me to save him. Now, therefore, since I neither visit more My native land, nor, present here, have aught Avail'd Patroclus or my many friends Whom noble Hector hath in battle slain, But here I sit unprofitable grown, Earth's burden, though of such heroic note, If not in council foremost (for I yield That prize to others) yet in feats of arms, Such as none other in Achaia's host, May fierce contention from among the Gods Perish, and from among the human race, With wrath, which sets the wisest hearts on fire; Sweeter than dropping honey to the taste, But in the bosom of mankind, a smoke! Such was my wrath which Agamemnon roused, The king of men. But since the past is fled Irrevocable, howsoe'er distress'd, Renounce we now vain musings on the past, Content through sad necessity. I go In quest of noble Hector, who hath slain My loved Patroclus, and such death will take, As Jove ordains me and the Powers of Heaven At their own season, send it when they may. For neither might the force of Hercules, Although high-favour'd of Saturnian Jove, From death escape, but Fate and the revenge Restless of Juno vanquish'd even Him. I also, if a destiny like his Await me, shall, like him, find rest in death; But glory calls me now; now will I make Some Trojan wife or Dardan with both hands Wipe her soft cheeks, and utter many a groan. Long time have I been absent from the field, And they shall know it. Love me as thou may'st, Yet thwart me not, for I am fixt to go. Whom Thetis answer'd, Goddess of the Deep. Thou hast well said, my son! it is no blame To save from threaten'd death our suffering friends. But thy magnificent and dazzling arms Are now in Trojan hands; them Hector wears Exulting, but ordain'd not long to exult, So habited; his death is also nigh. But thou with yonder warring multitudes Mix not, till thou behold me here again; For with the rising sun I will return To-morrow, and will bring thee glorious arms, By Vulcan forged himself, the King of fire. She said, and turning from her son aside, The sisterhood of Ocean thus address'd. Plunge ye again into the briny Deep, And to the hoary Sovereign of the floods Report as ye have heard. I to the heights Olympian haste, that I may there obtain From Vulcan, glorious artist of the skies, Arms of excelling beauty for my son. She said; they plunged into the waves again, And silver-footed Thetis, to the heights Olympian soaring swiftly to obtain Arms for renown'd Achilles, disappear'd. Meantime, with infinite uproar the Greeks From Hector's hero-slaying arm had fled Home to their galleys station'd on the banks Of Hellespont. Nor yet Achaia's sons Had borne the body of Patroclus clear From flight of darts away, but still again The multitude of warriors and of steeds Came on, by Priameian Hector led Rapid as fire. Thrice, noble Hector seized His ancles from behind, ardent to drag Patroclus, calling to his host the while; But thrice, the two Ajaces, clothed with might, Shock'd and repulsed him reeling. He with force Fill'd indefatigable, through his ranks Issuing, by turns assail'd them, and by turns Stood clamouring, yet not a step retired; But as the hinds deter not from his prey A tawny lion by keen hunger urged, So could not both Ajaces, warriors bold, Intimidate and from the body drive Hector; and he had dragg'd him thence and won Immortal glory, but that Iris, sent Unseen by Jove and by the Powers of heaven, From Juno, to Achilles brought command That he should show himself. Full near she drew, And in wing'd accents thus the Chief address'd. Hero! most terrible of men, arise! Protect Patroclus, for whose sake the war Stands at the fleet of Greece. Mutual prevails The slaughter, these the dead defending, those Resolute hence to drag him to the gates Of wind-swept Ilium. But beyond them all Illustrious Hector, obstinate is bent To win him, purposing to lop his head, And to exhibit it impaled on high. Thou then arise, nor longer on the ground Lie stretch'd inactive; let the thought with shame Touch thee, of thy Patroclus made the sport Of Trojan dogs, whose corse, if it return Dishonour'd home, brings with it thy reproach. To whom Achilles matchless in the race. Iris divine! of all the Gods who sent thee? Then, thus, the swift ambassadress of heaven. By Juno sent I come, consort of Jove. Nor knows Saturnian Jove high-throned, himself, My flight, or any of the Immortal Powers, Tenants of the Olympian heights snow-crown'd. Her answer'd then Pelides, glorious Chief. How shall I seek the fight? they have my arms. My mother charged me also to abstain From battle, till she bring me armour new Which she hath promised me from Vulcan's hand. Meantime, whose armour else might serve my need I know not, save perhaps alone the shield Of Telamonian Ajax, whom I deem Himself now busied in the stormy van, Slaying the Trojans in my friend's defence. To whom the swift-wing'd messenger of heaven. Full well we know thine armour Hector's prize. Yet, issuing to the margin of the foss, Show thyself only. Panic-seized, perchance, The Trojans shall from fight desist, and yield To the o'ertoil'd though dauntless sons of Greece Short respite; it is all that war allows. So saying, the storm-wing'd Iris disappear'd. Then rose at once Achilles dear to Jove, Athwart whose shoulders broad Minerva cast Her Ægis fringed terrific, and his brows Encircled with a golden cloud that shot Fires insupportable to sight abroad. As when some island, situate afar On the wide waves, invested all the day By cruel foes from their own city pour'd, Upsends a smoke to heaven, and torches shows On all her turrets at the close of eve Which flash against the clouds, kindled in hope Of aid from neighbour maritime allies, So from Achilles' head light flash'd to heaven. Issuing through the wall, beside the foss He stood, but mix'd not with Achaia's host, Obedient to his mother's wise command. He stood and shouted; Pallas also raised A dreadful shout, and tumult infinite Excited throughout all the host of Troy. Clear as the trumpet's note when it proclaims A numerous host approaching to invest Some city close around, so clear the voice Rang of Æacides, and tumult-toss'd Was every soul that heard the brazen tone. With swift recoil the long-maned coursers thrust The chariots back, all boding woe at hand, And every charioteer astonish'd saw Fires, that fail'd not, illumining the brows Of Peleus' son, by Pallas kindled there. Thrice, o'er the trench Achilles sent his voice Sonorous, and confusion at the sound Thrice seized the Trojans, and their famed allies. Twelve, in that moment of their noblest died By their own spears and chariots, and with joy The Greecians from beneath an hill of darts Dragging Patroclus, placed him on his bier. Around him throng'd his fellow-warriors bold, All weeping, after whom Achilles went Fast-weeping also at the doleful sight Of his true friend on his funereal bed Extended, gash'd with many a mortal wound, Whom he had sent into the fight with steeds And chariot, but received him thence no more. And now majestic Juno sent the sun, Unwearied minister of light, although Reluctant, down into the Ocean stream. So the sun sank, and the Achaians ceased From the all-wasting labours of the war. On the other side, the Trojans, from the fight Retiring, loosed their steeds, but ere they took Thought of refreshment, in full council met. It was a council at which no man sat, Or dared; all stood; such terrour had on all Fallen, for that Achilles had appear'd, After long pause from battle's arduous toil. First rose Polydamas the prudent son Of Panthus, above all the Trojans skill'd Both in futurity and in the past. He was the friend of Hector, and one night Gave birth to both. In council one excell'd, And one still more in feats of high renown. Thus then, admonishing them, he began. My friends! weigh well the occasion. Back to Troy By my advice, nor wait the sacred morn Here, on the plain, from Ilium's walls remote. So long as yet the anger of this Chief 'Gainst noble Agamemnon burn'd, so long We found the Greeks less formidable foes, And I rejoiced, myself, spending the night Beside their oary barks, for that I hoped To seize them; but I now tremble at thought Of Peleus' rapid son again in arms. A spirit proud as his will scorn to fight Here, on the plain, where Greeks and Trojans take Their common share of danger and of toil, And will at once strike at your citadel, Impatient till he make your wives his prey. Haste—let us home—else thus shall it befall; Night's balmy influence in his tent detains Achilles now, but rushing arm'd abroad To-morrow, should he find us lingering here, None shall mistake him then; happy the man Who soonest, then, shall 'scape to sacred Troy! Then, dogs shall make and vultures on our flesh Plenteous repast. Oh spare mine ears the tale! But if, though troubled, ye can yet receive My counsel, thus assembled we will keep Strict guard to-night; meantime, her gates and towers With all their mass of solid timbers, smooth And cramp'd with bolts of steel, will keep the town. But early on the morrow we will stand All arm'd on Ilium's towers. Then, if he chuse, His galleys left, to compass Troy about, He shall be task'd enough; his lofty steeds Shall have their fill of coursing to and fro Beneath, and gladly shall to camp return. But waste the town he shall not, nor attempt With all the utmost valour that he boasts To force a pass; dogs shall devour him first. To whom brave Hector louring, and in wrath. Polydamas, I like not thy advice Who bidd'st us in our city skulk, again Imprison'd there. Are ye not yet content? Wish ye for durance still in your own towers? Time was, when in all regions under heaven Men praised the wealth of Priam's city stored With gold and brass; but all our houses now Stand emptied of their hidden treasures rare. Jove in his wrath hath scatter'd them; our wealth Is marketted, and Phrygia hath a part Purchased, and part Mæonia's lovely land. But since the son of wily Saturn old Hath given me glory now, and to inclose The Greecians in their fleet hemm'd by the sea, Fool! taint not with such talk the public mind. For not a Trojan here will thy advice Follow, or shall; it hath not my consent. But thus I counsel. Let us, band by band, Throughout the host take supper, and let each, Guarded against nocturnal danger, watch. And if a Trojan here be rack'd in mind Lest his possessions perish, let him cast His golden heaps into the public maw ???????????????., Far better so consumed than by the Greeks. Then, with the morrow's dawn, all fair array'd In battle, we will give them at their fleet Sharp onset, and if Peleus' noble son Have risen indeed to conflict for the ships, The worse for him. I shall not for his sake Avoid the deep-toned battle, but will firm Oppose his utmost. Either he shall gain Or I, great glory. Mars his favours deals Impartial, and the slayer oft is slain. So counsell'd Hector, whom with shouts of praise The Trojans answer'd:—fools, and by the power Of Pallas of all sober thought bereft! For all applauded Hector, who had given Advice pernicious, and Polydamas, Whose counsel was discrete and wholesome, none. So then they took repast. But all night long The Greecians o'er Patroclus wept aloud, While, standing in the midst, Pelides led The lamentation, heaving many a groan, And on the bosom of his breathless friend Imposing, sad, his homicidal hands. As the grim lion, from whose gloomy lair Among thick trees the hunter hath his whelps Purloin'd, too late returning mourns his loss, Then, up and down, the length of many a vale Courses, exploring fierce the robber's foot, Incensed as he, and with a sigh deep-drawn Thus to his Myrmidons Achilles spake. How vain, alas! my word spoken that day At random, when to soothe the Hero's fears Menœtius, then our guest, I promised him His noble son at Opoeis again, Living and laden with the spoils of Troy! But Jove performs not all the thoughts of man, For we were both destined to tinge the soil Of Ilium with our blood, nor I shall see, Myself, my father in his mansion more Or Thetis, but must find my burial here. Yet, my Patroclus! since the earth expects Me next, I will not thy funereal rites Finish, till I shall bring both head and arms Of that bold Chief who slew thee, to my tent. I also will smite off, before thy pile, The heads of twelve illustrious sons of Troy, Resentful of thy death. Meantime, among My lofty galleys thou shalt lie, with tears Mourn'd day and night by Trojan captives fair And Dardan compassing thy bier around, Whom we, at price of labour hard, ourselves With massy spears toiling in battle took From many an opulent city, now no more. So saying, he bade his train surround with fire A tripod huge, that they might quickly cleanse Patroclus from all stain of clotted gore. They on the blazing hearth a tripod placed Capacious, fill'd with water its wide womb, And thrust dry wood beneath, till, fierce, the flames Embraced it round, and warm'd the flood within. Soon as the water in the singing brass Simmer'd, they bathed him, and with limpid oil Anointed; filling, next, his ruddy wounds With unguent mellow'd by nine circling years, They stretch'd him on his bed, then cover'd him From head to feet with linen texture light, And with a wide unsullied mantle, last. All night the Myrmidons around the swift Achilles stood, deploring loud his friend, And Jove his spouse and sister thus bespake So then, Imperial Juno! not in vain Thou hast the swift Achilles sought to rouse Again to battle; the Achaians, sure, Are thy own children, thou hast borne them all. To whom the aweful Goddess ample-eyed. What word hath pass'd thy lips, Jove, most severe? A man, though mortal merely, and to me Inferior in device, might have atchieved That labour easily. Can I who boast Myself the Chief of Goddesses, and such Not by birth only, but as thine espoused, Who art thyself Sovereign of all the Gods, Can I with anger burn against the house Of Priam, and want means of just revenge? Thus they in heaven their mutual conference held. Meantime, the silver-footed Thetis reach'd The starr'd abode eternal, brazen-wall'd Of Vulcan, by the builder lame himself Uprear'd, a wonder even in eyes divine. She found him sweating, at his bellows huge Toiling industrious; tripods bright he form'd Twenty at once, his palace-wall to grace Ranged in harmonious order. Under each Two golden wheels he set, on which (a sight Marvellous!) into council they should roll Self-moved, and to his house, self-moved, return. Thus far the work was finish'd, but not yet Their ears of exquisite design affixt, For them he stood fashioning, and prepared The rivets. While he thus his matchless skill Employ'd laborious, to his palace-gate The silver-footed Thetis now advanced, Whom Charis, Vulcan's well-attired spouse, Beholding from the palace portal, flew To seize the Goddess' hand, and thus enquired. Why, Thetis! worthy of all reverence And of all love, comest thou to our abode, Unfrequent here? But enter, and accept Such welcome as to such a guest is due. So saying, she introduced and to a seat Led her with argent studs border'd around And foot-stool'd sumptuously; then, calling forth Her spouse, the glorious artist, thus she said. Haste, Vulcan! Thetis wants thee; linger not. To whom the artist of the skies replied. A Goddess then, whom with much cause I love And venerate is here, who when I fell Saved me, what time my shameless mother sought To cast me, because lame, out of all sight; Then had I been indeed forlorn, had not Eurynome the daughter of the Deep And Thetis in their laps received me fallen. Nine years with them residing, for their use I form'd nice trinkets, clasps, rings, pipes, and chains, While loud around our hollow cavern roar'd The surge of the vast Deep, nor God nor man, Save Thetis and Eurynome, my life's Preservers, knew where I was kept conceal'd. Since, therefore, she is come, I cannot less Than recompense to Thetis amber-hair'd With readiness the boon of life preserved. Haste, then, and hospitably spread the board For her regale, while with my best dispatch I lay my bellows and my tools aside. He spake, and vast in bulk and hot with toil Rose limping from beside his anvil-stock Upborne with pain on legs tortuous and weak. First, from the forge dislodged he thrust apart His bellows, and his tools collecting all Bestow'd them, careful, in a silver chest, Then all around with a wet sponge he wiped His visage, and his arms and brawny neck Purified, and his shaggy breast from smutch; Last, putting on his vest, he took in hand His sturdy staff, and shuffled through the door. Beside the King of fire two golden forms Majestic moved, that served him in the place Of handmaids; young they seem'd, and seem'd alive, Nor want they intellect, or speech, or force, Or prompt dexterity by the Gods inspired. These his supporters were, and at his side Attended diligent, while He, with gait Uncouth, approaching Thetis where she sat On a bright throne, seized fast her hand and said. Why, Thetis! worthy as thou art of love And of all reverence, hast thou arrived, Unfrequent here? Speak—tell me thy desire, Nor doubt my services, if thou demand Things possible, and possible to me. Then Thetis, weeping plenteously, replied. Oh Vulcan! Is there on Olympus' heights A Goddess with such load of sorrow oppress'd As, in peculiar, Jove assigns to me? Me only, of all ocean-nymphs, he made Spouse to a man, Peleus Æacides, Whose bed, although reluctant and perforce, I yet endured to share. He now, the prey Of cheerless age, decrepid lies, and Jove Still other woes heaps on my wretched head. He gave me to bring forth, gave me to rear A son illustrious, valiant, and the chief Of heroes; he, like a luxuriant plant Upran ????????. to manhood, while his lusty growth I nourish'd as the husbandman his vine Set in a fruitful field, and being grown I sent him early in his gallant fleet Embark'd, to combat with the sons of Troy; But him from fight return'd I shall receive, Beneath the roof of Peleus, never more, And while he lives and on the sun his eyes Opens, affliction is his certain doom, Nor aid resides or remedy in me. The virgin, his own portion of the spoils, Allotted to him by the Greecians—Her Atrides, King of men, resumed, and grief Devour'd Achilles' spirit for her sake. Meantime, the Trojans shutting close within Their camp the Greecians, have forbidden them All egress, and the senators of Greece Have sought with splendid gifts to soothe my son. He, indisposed to rescue them himself From ruin, sent, instead, Patroclus forth Clad in his own resplendent armour, Chief Of the whole host of Myrmidons. Before The Scæan gate from morn to eve they fought, And on that self-same day had Ilium fallen, But that Apollo, to advance the fame Of Hector, slew Menœtius' noble son Full-flush'd with victory. Therefore at thy knees Suppliant I fall, imploring from thine art A shield and helmet, greaves of shapely form With clasps secured, and corslet for my son. For those, once his, his faithful friend hath lost, Slain by the Trojans, and Achilles lies, Himself, extended mournful on the ground. Her answer'd then the artist of the skies. Courage! Perplex not with these cares thy soul. I would that when his fatal hour shall come, I could as sure secrete him from the stroke Of destiny, as he shall soon have arms Illustrious, such as each particular man Of thousands, seeing them, shall wish his own. He said, and to his bellows quick repair'd, Which turning to the fire he bade them heave. Full twenty bellows working all at once Breathed on the furnace, blowing easy and free The managed winds, now forcible, as best Suited dispatch, now gentle, if the will Of Vulcan and his labour so required. Impenetrable brass, tin, silver, gold, He cast into the forge, then, settling firm His ponderous anvil on the block, one hand With his huge hammer fill'd, one with the tongs. He fashion'd first a shield massy and broad Of labour exquisite, for which he form'd A triple border beauteous, dazzling bright, And loop'd it with a silver brace behind. The shield itself with five strong folds he forged, And with devices multiform the disk Capacious charged, toiling with skill divine. There he described the earth, the heaven, the sea, The sun that rests not, and the moon full-orb'd. There also, all the stars which round about As with a radiant frontlet bind the skies, The Pleiads and the Hyads, and the might Of huge Orion, with Him Ursa call'd, Known also by his popular name, the Wain, That spins around the pole looking toward Orion, only star of these denied To slake his beams in Ocean's briny baths. Two splendid cities also there he form'd Such as men build. In one were to be seen Rites matrimonial solemnized with pomp Of sumptuous banquets; from their chambers forth Leading the brides they usher'd them along With torches through the streets, and sweet was heard The voice around of Hymenæal song. Here striplings danced in circles to the sound Of pipe and harp, while in the portals stood Women, admiring, all, the gallant show. Elsewhere was to be seen in council met The close-throng'd multitude. There strife arose. Two citizens contended for a mulet The price of blood. This man affirm'd the fine All paid, haranguing vehement the crowd, That man denied that he had aught received, And to the judges each made his appeal Eager for their award. Meantime the people, As favour sway'd them, clamour'd loud for each. The heralds quell'd the tumult; reverend sat On polish'd stones the Elders in a ring, Each with an herald's sceptre in his hand, Which holding they arose, and all in turn Gave sentence. In the midst two talents lay Of gold, his destined recompense whose voice Decisive should pronounce the best award. The other city by two glittering hosts Invested stood, and a dispute arose Between the hosts, whether to burn the town And lay all waste, or to divide the spoil. Meantime, the citizens, still undismay'd, Surrender'd not the town, but taking arms Secretly, set the ambush in array, And on the walls their wives and children kept Vigilant guard, with all the antient men. They sallied; at their head Pallas and Mars Both golden and in golden vests attired Advanced, proportion each showing divine, Large, prominent, and such as Gods beseem'd. Not such the people, but of humbler size. Arriving at the spot for ambush chosen, A river's side, where cattle of each kind Drank, down they sat, all arm'd in dazzling brass. Apart from all the rest sat also down Two spies, both looking for the flocks and herds. Soon they appear'd, and at their side were seen Two shepherd swains, each playing on his pipe Careless, and of the danger nought apprized. Swift ran the spies, perceiving their approach, And intercepting suddenly the herds And flocks of silver fleece, slew also those Who fed them. The besiegers, at that time In council, by the sound alarm'd, their steeds Mounted, and hasted, instant, to the place; Then, standing on the river's brink they fought And push'd each other with the brazen lance. There Discord raged, there Tumult, and the force Of ruthless Destiny; she now a Chief Seized newly wounded, and now captive held Another yet unhurt, and now a third Dragg'd breathless through the battle by his feet, And all her garb was dappled thick with blood. Like living men they traversed and they strove, And dragg'd by turns the bodies of the slain. He also graved on it a fallow field Rich, spacious, and well-till'd. Ploughers not few, There driving to and fro their sturdy teams, Labour'd the land; and oft as in their course They came to the field's bourn, so oft a man Met them, who in their hands a goblet placed Charged with delicious wine. They, turning, wrought Each his own furrow, and impatient seem'd To reach the border of the tilth, which black Appear'd behind them as a glebe new-turn'd, Though golden. Sight to be admired by all! There too he form'd the likeness of a field Crowded with corn, in which the reapers toil'd Each with a sharp-tooth'd sickle in his hand. Along the furrow here, the harvest fell In frequent handfulls, there, they bound the sheaves. Three binders of the sheaves their sultry task All plied industrious, and behind them boys Attended, filling with the corn their arms And offering still their bundles to be bound. Amid them, staff in hand, the master stood Silent exulting, while beneath an oak Apart, his heralds busily prepared The banquet, dressing a well-thriven ox New slain, and the attendant maidens mix'd Large supper for the hinds of whitest flour. There also, laden with its fruit he form'd A vineyard all of gold; purple he made The clusters, and the vines supported stood By poles of silver set in even rows. The trench he colour'd sable, and around Fenced it with tin. One only path it show'd By which the gatherers when they stripp'd the vines Pass'd and repass'd. There, youths and maidens blithe In frails of wicker bore the luscious fruit, While, in the midst, a boy on his shrill harp Harmonious play'd, still as he struck the chord Carolling to it with a slender voice. They smote the ground together, and with song And sprightly reed came dancing on behind. There too an herd he fashion'd of tall beeves Part gold, part tin. They, lowing, from the stalls Rush'd forth to pasture by a river-side Rapid, sonorous, fringed with whispering reeds. Four golden herdsmen drove the kine a-field By nine swift dogs attended. Dreadful sprang Two lions forth, and of the foremost herd Seized fast a bull. Him bellowing they dragg'd, While dogs and peasants all flew to his aid. The lions tore the hide of the huge prey And lapped his entrails and his blood. Meantime The herdsmen, troubling them in vain, their hounds Encouraged; but no tooth for lions' flesh Found they, and, therefore stood aside and bark'd. There also, the illustrious smith divine Amidst a pleasant grove a pasture form'd Spacious, and sprinkled o'er with silver sheep Numerous, and stalls and huts and shepherds' tents. To these the glorious Artist added next, With various skill delineated exact, A labyrinth for the dance, such as of old In Crete's broad island Dædalus composed For bright-hair'd Ariadne. There the youths And youth-alluring maidens, hand in hand, Danced jocund, every maiden, neat-attired In finest linen, and the youths in vests Well-woven, glossy as the glaze of oil. These all wore garlands, and bright faulchions, those, Of burnish'd gold in silver trappings hung:— They with well-tutor'd step, now, nimbly ran The circle, swift, as when, before his wheel Seated, the potter twirls it with both hands For trial of its speed, now, crossing quick They pass'd at once into each other's place. On either side spectators numerous stood Delighted, and two tumblers roll'd themselves Between the dancers, singing as they roll'd. Last, with the might of Ocean's boundless flood He fill'd the border of the wonderous shield. When thus the massy shield magnificent He had accomplish'd, for the hero next He forged, more ardent than the blaze of fire, A corslet; then, a ponderous helmet bright Well fitted to his brows, crested with gold, And with laborious art divine adorn'd. He also made him greaves of molten tin. The armour finish'd, bearing in his hand The whole, he set it down at Thetis' feet. She, like a falcon, from the snowy top Stoop'd of Olympus, bearing to the earth The dazzling wonder fresh from Vulcan's hand. BOOK XIX. ARGUMENT OF THE NINETEENTH BOOK. Achilles is reconciled to Agamemnon, and cloathed in new armour forged by Vulcan, leads out the Myrmidons to battle. Now rose the morn in saffron vest attired From Ocean, with new day for Gods and men, When Thetis at the fleet of Greece arrived, Bearing that gift divine. She found her son All tears, and close enfolding in his arms Patroclus, while his Myrmidons around Wept also; she amid them, graceful, stood, And seizing fast his hand, him thus bespake. Although our loss be great, yet, oh my son! Leave we Patroclus lying on the bier To which the Gods ordain'd him from the first. Receive from Vulcan's hands these glorious arms, Such as no mortal shoulders ever bore. So saying, she placed the armour on the ground Before him, and the whole bright treasure rang. A tremor shook the Myrmidons; none dared Look on it, but all fled. Not so himself. In him fresh vengeance kindled at the view, And, while he gazed, a splendour as of fire Flash'd from his eyes. Delighted, in his hand He held the glorious bounty of the God, And, wondering at those strokes of art divine, His eager speech thus to his mother turn'd. The God, my mother! hath bestow'd in truth Such armour on me as demanded skill Like his, surpassing far all power of man. Now, therefore, I will arm. But anxious fears Trouble me, lest intrusive flies, meantime, Breed worms within the spear-inflicted wounds Of Menœtiades, and fill with taint Of putrefaction his whole breathless form. But him the silver-footed Goddess fair Thus answer'd. Oh, my son! chase from thy mind All such concern. I will, myself, essay To drive the noisome swarms which on the slain In battle feed voracious. Should he lie The year complete, his flesh shall yet be found Untainted, and, it may be, fragrant too. But thou the Heroes of Achaia's host Convening, in their ears thy wrath renounce Against the King of men, then, instant, arm For battle, and put on thy glorious might. So saying, the Goddess raised his courage high. Then, through the nostrils of the dead she pour'd Ambrosia, and the ruddy juice divine Of nectar, antidotes against decay. And now forth went Achilles by the side Of Ocean, calling with a dreadful shout To council all the Heroes of the host. Then, even they who in the fleet before Constant abode, helmsmen and those who held In stewardship the food and public stores, All flock'd to council, for that now at length After long abstinence from dread exploits Of war, Achilles had once more appear'd. Two went together, halting on the spear, (For still they felt the anguish of their wounds) Noble Ulysses and brave Diomede, And took an early seat; whom follow'd last The King of men, by Coön in the field Of furious battle wounded with a lance. The Greecians all assembled, in the midst Upstood the swift Achilles, and began. Atrides! we had doubtless better sped Both thou and I, thus doing, when at first With cruel rage we burn'd, a girl the cause. I would that Dian's shaft had in the fleet Slain her that self-same day when I destroy'd Lyrnessus, and by conquest made her mine! Then had not many a Greecian, lifeless now, Clench'd with his teeth the ground, victim, alas! Of my revenge; whence triumph hath accrued To Hector and his host, while ours have cause For long remembrance of our mutual strife. But evils past let pass, yielding perforce To sad necessity. My wrath shall cease Now; I resign it; it hath burn'd too long. Thou therefore summon forth the host to fight, That I may learn meeting them in the field, If still the Trojans purpose at our fleet To watch us this night also. But I judge That driven by my spear to rapid flight, They shall escape with weary limbs ???????? ???? ???????—Shall be glad to bend their knee, i. e. to sit and repose themselves. at least. He ended, and the Greecians brazen-greaved Rejoiced that Peleus' mighty son had cast His wrath aside. Then not into the midst Proceeding, but at his own seat, upstood King Agamemnon, and them thus bespake. Friends! Greecian Heroes! Ministers of Mars! Arise who may to speak, he claims your ear; All interruption wrongs him, and distracts, Howe'er expert the speaker. Who can hear Amid the roar of tumult, or who speak? The clearest voice, best utterance, both are vain. I shall address Achilles. Hear my speech Ye Argives, and with understanding mark. I hear not now the voice of your reproach ?????? ?????.—He seems to intend the reproaches sounded in his ear from all quarters, and which he had repeatedly heard before. First; ye have oft condemn'd me. Yet the blame Rests not with me; Jove, Destiny, and she Who roams the shades, Erynnis, caused the offence. She fill'd my soul with fury on that day In council, when I seized Achilles' prize. For what could I? All things obey the Gods. Ate, pernicious Power, daughter of Jove, By whom all suffer, challenges from all Reverence and fear. Delicate are her feet Which scorn the ground, and over human heads She glides, injurious to the race of man, Of Two who strive, at least entangling One. She injured, on a day, dread Jove himself Most excellent of all in earth or heaven, When Juno, although female, him deceived, What time Alcmena should have brought to light In bulwark'd Thebes the force of Hercules. Then Jove, among the gods glorying, spake. Hear all! both Gods and Goddesses, attend! That I may make my purpose known. This day Birth-pang-dispensing Ilithya brings An Hero forth to light, who, sprung from those That sprang from me, his empire shall extend Over all kingdoms bordering on his own. To whom, designing fraud, Juno replied. Thou wilt be found false, and this word of thine Shall want performance. But Olympian Jove! Swear now the inviolable oath, that He Who shall, this day, fall from between the feet Of woman, drawing his descent from thee, Shall rule all kingdoms bordering on his own. She said, and Jove, suspecting nought her wiles, The great oath swore, to his own grief and wrong. At once from the Olympian summit flew Juno, and to Achaian Argos borne, There sought the noble wife By some call'd Antibia, by others, Nicippe. of Sthenelus, Offspring of Perseus. Pregnant with a son Six months, she now the seventh saw at hand, But him the Goddess premature produced, And check'd Alcmena's pangs already due. Then joyful to have so prevail'd, she bore Herself the tidings to Saturnian Jove. Lord of the candent lightnings! Sire of all! I bring thee tidings. The great prince, ordain'd To rule the Argive race, this day is born, Eurystheus, son of Sthenelus, the son Of Perseus; therefore he derives from thee, Nor shall the throne of Argos shame his birth. She spake; then anguish stung the heart of Jove Deeply, and seizing by her glossy locks The Goddess Ate, in his wrath he swore That never to the starry skies again And the Olympian heights he would permit The universal mischief to return. Then, whirling her around, he cast her down To earth. She, mingling with all works of men, Caused many a pang to Jove, who saw his son Laborious tasks servile, and of his birth Unworthy, at Eurystheus' will enjoin'd. So when the Hero Hector at our ships Slew us, I then regretted my offence Which Ate first impell'd me to commit. But since, infatuated by the Gods I err'd, behold me ready to appease With gifts of price immense whom I have wrong'd. Thou, then, arise to battle, and the host Rouse also. Not a promise yesternight Was made thee by Ulysses in thy tent On my behalf, but shall be well perform'd. Or if it please thee, though impatient, wait Short season, and my train shall bring the gifts Even now; that thou may'st understand and know That my peace-offerings are indeed sincere To whom Achilles, swiftest of the swift. Atrides! Agamemnon! passing all In glory! King of men! recompense just By gifts to make me, or to make me none, That rests with thee. But let us to the fight Incontinent. It is no time to play The game of rhetoric, and to waste the hours In speeches. Much remains yet unperform'd. Achilles must go forth. He must be seen Once more in front of battle, wasting wide With brazen spear, the crowded ranks of Troy. Mark Him—and as He fights, fight also ye. To whom Ulysses ever-wise replied. Nay—Urge not, valiant as thou art thyself, Achaia's sons up to the battlements Of Ilium, by repast yet unrefresh'd, Godlike Achilles!—For when phalanx once Shall clash with phalanx, and the Gods with rage Both hosts inspire, the contest shall not then Prove short. Bid rather the Achaians take Both food and wine, for they are strength and might. To stand all day till sunset to a foe Opposed in battle, fasting, were a task Might foil the best; for though his will be prompt To combat, yet the power must by degrees Forsake him; thirst and hunger he must feel, And his limbs failing him at every step. But he who hath his vigour to the full Fed with due nourishment, although he fight All day, yet feels his courage unimpair'd, Nor weariness perceives till all retire. Come then—dismiss the people with command That each prepare replenishment. Meantime Let Agamemnon, King of men, his gifts In presence here of the assembled Greeks Produce, that all may view them, and that thou May'st feel thine own heart gladden'd at the sight. Let the King also, standing in the midst, Swear to thee, that he renders back the maid A virgin still, and strange to his embrace, And let thy own composure prove, the while, That thou art satisfied. Last, let him spread A princely banquet for thee in his tent, That thou may'st want no part of just amends. Thou too, Atrides, shalt hereafter prove More just to others; for himself, a King, Stoops not too low, soothing whom he hath wrong'd. Him Agamemnon answer'd King of men. Thou hast arranged wisely the whole concern, O Laertiades, and I have heard Thy speech, both words and method with delight. Willing I am, yea more, I wish to swear As thou hast said, for by the Gods I can Most truly. Let Achilles, though of pause Impatient, suffer yet a short delay With all assembled here, till from my tent The gifts arrive, and oaths of peace be sworn. To thee I give it in peculiar charge That chusing forth the most illustrious youths Of all Achaia, thou produce the gifts From my own ship, all those which yesternight We promised, nor the women leave behind. And let Talthybius throughout all the camp Of the Achaians, instant, seek a boar For sacrifice to Jove and to the Sun. Then thus Achilles matchless in the race. Atrides! most illustrious! King of men! Expedience bids us to these cares attend Hereafter, when some pause, perchance, of fight Shall happen, and the martial rage which fires My bosom now, shall somewhat less be felt. Our friends by Priameian Hector slain, Now strew the field mangled, for him hath Jove Exalted high, and given him great renown. But haste, now take refreshment; though, in truth, Might I direct, the host should by all means Unfed to battle, and at set of sun All sup together, this affront revenged. But as for me, no drop shall pass my lips Or morsel, whose companion lies with feet Turn'd to the vestibule, pierced by the spear, And compass'd by my weeping train around. No want of food feel I. My wishes call For carnage, blood, and agonies and groans. But Him, excelling in all wisdom, thus Ulysses answer'd. Oh Achilles! son Of Peleus! bravest far of all our host! Me, in no scanty measure, thou excell'st Wielding the spear, and thee in prudence, I Not less. For I am elder, and have learn'd What thou hast yet to learn. Bid then thine heart Endure with patience to be taught by me. Men, satiate soon with battle, loath the field On which the most abundant harvest falls, Reap'd by the sword; and when the hand of Jove, Dispenser of the great events of war, Turns once the scale, then, farewell every hope Of more than scanty gleanings. Shall the Greeks Abstain from sustenance for all who die? That were indeed severe, since day by day No few expire, and respite could be none. The dead, die whoso may, should be inhumed. This, duty bids, but bids us also deem One day sufficient for our sighs and tears. Ourselves, all we who still survive the war, Have need of sustenance, that we may bear The lengthen'd conflict with recruited might, Cased in enduring brass.—Ye all have heard Your call to battle; let none lingering stand In expectation of a farther call, Which if it sound, shall thunder prove to him Who lurks among the ships. No. Rush we all Together forth, for contest sharp, prepared, And persevering with the host of Troy. So saying, the sons of Nestor, glorious Chief, He chose, with Meges Phyleus' noble son, Thoas, Meriones, and Melanippus And Lycomedes. These, together, sought The tent of Agamemnon, King of men. They ask'd, and they received. Soon they produced The seven promised tripods from the tent, Twice ten bright cauldrons, twelve high-mettled steeds, Seven lovely captives skill'd alike in arts Domestic, of unblemish'd beauty rare, And last, Brisëis with the blooming cheeks. Before them went Ulysses, bearing weigh'd Ten golden talents, whom the chosen Greeks Attended laden with the remnant gifts. Full in the midst they placed them. Then arose King Agamemnon, and Talthybius The herald, clear in utterance as a God, Beside him stood, holding the victim boar. Atrides, drawing forth his dagger bright, Appendant ever to his sword's huge sheath, Sever'd the bristly forelock of the boar, A previous offering. Next, with lifted hands To Jove he pray'd, while, all around, the Greeks Sat listening silent to the Sovereign's voice. He look'd to the wide heaven, and thus he pray'd. First, Jove be witness! of all Powers above Best and supreme; Earth next, and next the Sun! And last, who under earth the guilt avenge Of oaths sworn falsely, let the Furies hear! For no respect of amorous desire Or other purpose, have I laid mine hand On fair Brisëis, but within my tent Untouch'd, immaculate she hath remain'd. And if I falsely swear, then may the Gods The many woes with which they mark the crime Of men forsworn, pour also down on me! So saying, he pierced the victim in his throat, And, whirling him around, Talthybius, next, Cast him into the ocean, fishes' food. Then, in the centre of Achaia's sons Uprose Achilles, and thus spake again. Jove! Father! dire calamities, effects Of thy appointment, fall on human-kind. Never had Agamemnon in my breast Such anger kindled, never had he seized, Blinded by wrath, and torn my prize away, But that the slaughter of our numerous friends Which thence ensued, thou hadst, thyself, ordain'd. Now go, ye Greecians, eat, and then to battle. So saying, Achilles suddenly dissolved The hasty council, and all flew dispersed To their own ships. Then took the Myrmidons Those splendid gifts which in the tent they lodged Of swift Achilles, and the damsels led Each to a seat, while others of his train Drove forth the steeds to pasture with his herd. But when Brisëis, bright as Venus, saw Patroclus lying mangled by the spear, Enfolding him around, she shriek'd and tore Her bosom, her smooth neck and beauteous cheeks. Then thus, divinely fair, with tears she said. Ah, my Patroclus! dearest friend of all To hapless me, departing from this tent I left thee living, and now, generous Chief! Restored to it again, here find thee dead. How rapid in succession are my woes! I saw, myself, the valiant prince to whom My parents had betroth'd me, slain before Our city walls; and my three brothers, sons Of my own mother, whom with long regret I mourn, fell also in that dreadful field. But when the swift Achilles slew the prince Design'd my spouse, and the fair city sack'd Of noble Mynes, thou by every art Of tender friendship didst forbid my tears, Promising oft that thou would'st make me bride Of Peleus' godlike son, that thy own ship Should waft me hence to Phthia, and that thyself Would'st furnish forth among the Myrmidons Our nuptial feast. Therefore thy death I mourn Ceaseless, for thou wast ever kind to me. She spake, and all her fellow-captives heaved Responsive sighs, deploring each, in show, The dead Patroclus, but, in truth, herself. Then the Achaian Chiefs gather'd around Achilles, wooing him to eat, but He Groan'd, and still resolute, their suit refused— If I have here a friend on whom by prayers I may prevail, I pray that ye desist, Nor longer press me, mourner as I am, To eat or drink, for till the sun go down I am inflexible, and will abstain. So saying, the other princes he dismiss'd Impatient, but the sons of Atreus both, Ulysses, Nestor, and Idomeneus, With Phœnix, hoary warrior, in his tent Abiding still, with cheerful converse kind Essay'd to soothe him, whose afflicted soul All soothing scorn'd till he should once again Rush on the ravening edge of bloody war. Then, mindful of his friend, groaning he said. Time was, unhappiest, dearest of my friends! When even thou, with diligent dispatch, Thyself, hast spread a table in my tent, The hour of battle drawing nigh between The Greeks and warlike Trojans. But there lies Thy body now, gored by the ruthless steel, And for thy sake I neither eat nor drink, Though dearth be none, conscious that other woe Surpassing this I can have none to fear. No, not if tidings of my father's death Should reach me, who, this moment, weeps, perhaps, In Phthia tears of tenderest regret For such a son; while I, remote from home, Fight for detested Helen under Troy. Nor even were He dead, whom, if he live, I rear in Scyros, my own darling son, My Neoptolemus of form divine. For still this hope I cherish'd in my breast Till now, that, of us two, myself alone Should fall at Ilium, and that thou, restored To Phthia, should'st have wafted o'er the waves My son from Scyros to his native home, That thou might'st show him all his heritage, My train of menials, and my fair abode. For either dead already I account Peleus, or doubt not that his residue Of miserable life shall soon be spent, Through stress of age and expectation sad That tidings of my death shall, next, arrive. So spake Achilles weeping, around whom The Chiefs all sigh'd, each with remembrance pain'd Of some loved object left at home. Meantime Jove, with compassion moved, their sorrow saw, And in wing'd accents thus to Pallas spake. Daughter! thou hast abandon'd, as it seems, Yon virtuous Chief for ever; shall no care Thy mind engage of brave Achilles more? Before his gallant fleet mourning he sits His friend, disconsolate; the other Greeks Eat and are satisfied; he only fasts. Go, then—instil nectar into his breast, And sweets ambrosial, that he hunger not. So saying, he urged Minerva prompt before. In form a shrill-voiced harpy of long wing Through ether down she darted, while the Greeks In all their camp for instant battle arm'd. Ambrosial sweets and nectar she instill'd Into his breast, lest he should suffer loss Of strength through abstinence, then soar'd again To her great Sire's unperishing abode. And now the Greecians from their gallant fleet All pour'd themselves abroad. As when thick snow From Jove descends, driven by impetuous gusts Of the cloud-scattering North, so frequent shone Issuing from the fleet the dazzling casques, Boss'd bucklers, hauberks strong, and ashen spears. Upwent the flash to heaven; wide all around The champain laugh'd with beamy brass illumed, And tramplings of the warriors on all sides Resounded, amidst whom Achilles arm'd. He gnash'd his teeth, fire glimmer'd in his eyes, Anguish intolerable wrung his heart And fury against Troy, while he put on His glorious arms, the labour of a God. First, to his legs his polish'd greaves he clasp'd Studded with silver, then his corslet bright Braced to his bosom, his huge sword of brass Athwart his shoulder slung, and his broad shield Uplifted last, luminous as the moon. Such as to mariners a fire appears, Kindled by shepherds on the distant top Of some lone hill; they, driven by stormy winds, Reluctant roam far off the fishy Deep, Such from Achilles' burning shield divine A lustre struck the skies; his ponderous helm He lifted to his brows; starlike it shone, And shook its curling crest of bushy gold, By Vulcan taught to wave profuse around. So clad, godlike Achilles trial made If his arms fitted him, and gave free scope To his proportion'd limbs; buoyant they proved As wings, and high upbore his airy tread. He drew his father's spear forth from its case, Heavy and huge and long. That spear, of all Achaia's sons, none else had power to wield; Achilles only could the Pelian spear Brandish, by Chiron for his father hewn From Pelion's top for slaughter of the brave. His coursers, then, Automedon prepared And Alcimus, adjusting diligent The fair caparisons; they thrust the bits Into their mouths, and to the chariot seat Extended and made fast the reins behind. The splendid scourge commodious to the grasp Seizing, at once Automedon upsprang Into his place; behind him, arm'd complete Achilles mounted, as the orient sun All dazzling, and with aweful tone his speech Directed to the coursers of his Sire. Xanthus, and Balius of Podarges' blood Illustrious! see ye that, the battle done, Ye bring whom now ye bear back to the host Of the Achaians in far other sort, Nor leave him, as ye left Patroclus, dead. Him then his steed unconquer'd in the race, Xanthus, thus answer'd from beneath his yoke, But, hanging low his head, and with his mane Dishevell'd all, and streaming to the ground. Him Juno vocal made, Goddess white-arm'd. And doubtless so we will. This day at least We bear thee safe from battle, stormy Chief! But thee the hour of thy destruction swift Approaches, hasten'd by no fault of ours, But by the force of fate and power divine. For not through sloth or tardiness on us Aught chargeable, have Ilium's sons thine arms Stript from Patroclus' shoulders, but a God Matchless in battle, offspring of bright-hair'd Latona, him contending in the van Slew, for the glory of the Chief of Troy. We, Zephyrus himself, though by report Swiftest of all the winds of heaven, in speed Could equal, but the Fates thee also doom By human hands to fall, and hands divine. The interposing Furies at that word Suppress'd his utterance, and indignant, thus, Achilles, swiftest of the swift, replied. Why, Xanthus, propheciest thou my death? It ill beseems thee. I already know That from my parents far remote my doom Appoints me here to die; yet not the more Cease I from feats of arms, till Ilium's host Shall have received, at length, their fill of war. He said, and with a shout drove forth to battle. BOOK XX. ARGUMENT OF THE TWENTIETH BOOK. By permission of Jupiter the Gods descend into the battle, and range themselves on either side respectively. Neptune rescues Æneas from death by the hand of Achilles, from whom Apollo, soon after, rescues Hector. Achilles slays many Trojans. The Greecians, thus, before their lofty ships Stood arm'd around Achilles, glorious Chief Insatiable with war, and opposite The Trojans on the rising-ground appear'd. Meantime, Jove order'd Themis, from the head Of the deep-fork'd Olympian to convene The Gods in council. She to every part Proceeding, bade them to the courts of Jove. Nor of the Floods was any absent thence Oceanus except, or of the Nymphs Who haunt the pleasant groves, or dwell beside Stream-feeding fountains, or in meadows green. Within the courts of cloud-assembler Jove Arrived, on pillar'd thrones radiant they sat, With ingenuity divine contrived By Vulcan for the mighty Sire of all. Thus they within the Thunderer's palace sat Assembled; nor was Neptune slow to hear The voice of Themis, but (the billows left) Came also; in the midst his seat he took, And ask'd, incontinent, the mind of Jove. King of the lightnings! wherefore hast thou call'd The Gods to council? Hast thou aught at heart Important to the hosts of Greece and Troy? For on the battle's fiery edge they stand. To whom replied Jove, Sovereign of the storms. Thou know'st my counsel, Shaker of the shores! And wherefore ye are call'd. Although ordain'd So soon to die, they interest me still. Myself, here seated on Olympus' top, With contemplation will my mind indulge Of yon great spectacle; but ye, the rest, Descend into the field, Trojan or Greek Each to assist, as each shall most incline. For should Achilles in the field no foe Find save the Trojans, quickly should they fly Before the rapid force of Peleus' son. They trembled ever at his look, and since Such fury for his friend hath fired his heart, I fear lest he anticipate the will Of Fate, and Ilium perish premature. So spake the son of Saturn kindling war Inevitable, and the Gods to fight 'Gan move with minds discordant. Juno sought And Pallas, with the earth-encircling Power Neptune, the Greecian fleet, with whom were join'd Mercury, teacher of all useful arts, And Vulcan, rolling on all sides his eyes Tremendous, but on disproportion'd legs, Not without labour hard, halting uncouth. Mars, warrior-God, on Ilium's part appear'd With Phœbus never-shorn, Dian shaft-arm'd, Xanthus, Latona, and the Queen of smiles, Venus. So long as the Immortal Gods Mix'd not with either host, Achaia's sons Exulted, seeing, after tedious pause, Achilles in the field, and terrour shook The knees of every Trojan, at the sight Of swift Achilles like another Mars Panting for blood, and bright in arms again. But when the Olympian Powers had enter'd once The multitude, then Discord, at whose voice The million maddens, vehement arose; Then, Pallas at the trench without the wall By turns stood shouting, and by turns a shout Sent terrible along the sounding shore, While, gloomy as a tempest, opposite, Mars from the lofty citadel of Troy Now yell'd aloud, now running o'er the hill Callicolone, on the Simois' side. Thus the Immortals, ever-blest, impell'd Both hosts to battle, and dire inroad caused Of strife among them. Sudden from on high The Sire of Gods and men thunder'd; meantime, Neptune the earth and the high mountains shook; Through all her base and to her topmost peak Ida spring-fed the agitation felt Reeling, all Ilium and the fleet of Greece. Upstarted from his throne, appall'd, the King Of Erebus, and with a cry his fears Through hell proclaim'd, lest Neptune, o'er his head Shattering the vaulted earth, should wide disclose To mortal and immortal eyes his realm Terrible, squalid, to the Gods themselves A dreaded spectacle; with such a sound The Powers eternal into battle rush'd. Opposed to Neptune, King of the vast Deep, Apollo stood with his wing'd arrows arm'd; Pallas to Mars; Diana shaft-expert, Sister of Phœbus, in her golden bow Rejoicing, with whose shouts the forests ring, To Juno; Mercury, for useful arts Famed, to Latona; and to Vulcan's force The eddied River broad by mortal men Scamander call'd, but Xanthus by the Gods. So Gods encounter'd Gods. But most desire Achilles felt, breaking the ranks, to rush On Priameian Hector, with whose blood Chiefly his fury prompted him to sate The indefatigable God of war. But, the encourager of Ilium's host Apollo, urged Æneas to assail The son of Peleus, with heroic might Inspiring his bold heart. He feign'd the voice Of Priam's son Lycaon, and his form Assuming, thus the Trojan Chief address'd. Æneas! Trojan leader! where are now Thy vaunts, which, banquetting erewhile among Our princes, o'er thy brimming cups thou mad'st, That thou would'st fight, thyself, with Peleus' son? To whom Æneas answer thus returned. Offspring of Priam! why enjoin'st thou me Not so inclined, that arduous task, to cope With the unmatch'd Achilles? I have proved His force already, when he chased me down From Ida with his spear, what time he made Seizure of all our cattle, and destroy'd Pedasus and Lyrnessus; but I 'scaped Unslain, by Jove himself empower'd to fly. Else had I fallen by Achilles' hand, And by the hand of Pallas, who his steps Conducted, and exhorted him to slay Us and the Leleges. Vain, therefore, proves All mortal force to Peleus' son opposed; For one, at least, of the Immortals stands Ever beside him, guardian of his life, And, of himself, he hath an arm that sends His rapid spear unerring to the mark. Yet, would the Gods more equal sway the scales Of battle, not with ease should he subdue Me, though he boast a panoply of brass. Him, then, Apollo answer'd, son of Jove. Hero! prefer to the Immortal Gods Thy prayer, for thee men rumour Venus' son, Daughter of Jove, and Peleus' son his birth Drew from a Goddess of inferior note. Thy mother is from Jove; the offspring, his, Less noble of the hoary Ocean old. Go, therefore, and thy conquering spear uplift Against him, nor let aught his sounding words Appall thee, or his threats turn thee away. So saying, with martial force the Chief he fill'd, Who through the foremost combatants advanced Radiant in arms. Nor pass'd Anchises' son Unseen of Juno, through the crowded ranks Seeking Achilles, but the Powers of heaven Convened by her command, she thus address'd. Neptune, and thou, Minerva! with mature Deliberation, ponder the event. Yon Chief, Æneas, dazzling bright in arms, Goes to withstand Achilles, and he goes Sent by Apollo; in despight of whom Be it our task to give him quick repulse, Or, of ourselves, let some propitious Power Strengthen Achilles with a mind exempt From terrour, and with force invincible. So shall he know that of the Gods above The mightiest are his friends, with whom compared The favourers of Ilium in time past, Who stood her guardians in the bloody strife, Are empty boasters all, and nothing worth. For therefore came we down, that we may share This fight, and that Achilles suffer nought Fatal to-day, though suffer all he must Hereafter, with his thread of life entwined By Destiny, the day when he was born. But should Achilles unapprized remain Of such advantage by a voice divine, When he shall meet some Deity in the field, Fear then will seize him, for celestial forms Unveil'd are terrible to mortal eyes. To whom replied the Shaker of the shores. Juno! thy hot impatience needs controul; It ill befits thee. No desire I feel To force into contention with ourselves Gods, our inferiors. No. Let us, retired To yonder hill, distant from all resort, There sit, while these the battle wage alone. But if Apollo, or if Mars the fight Entering, begin, themselves, to interfere Against Achilles, then will we at once To battle also; and, I much misdeem, Or glad they shall be soon to mix again Among the Gods on the Olympian heights, By strong coercion of our arms subdued. So saying, the God of Ocean azure-hair'd Moved foremost to the lofty mound earth-built Of noble Hercules, by Pallas raised And by the Trojans for his safe escape, What time the monster of the Deep pursued The Hero from the sea-bank o'er the plain. There Neptune sat, and his confederate Gods, Their shoulders with impenetrable clouds O'ermantled, while the city-spoiler Mars Sat with Apollo opposite on the hill Callicolone, with their aids divine. So, Gods to Gods in opposite aspect Sat ruminating, and alike the work All fearing to begin of arduous war, While from his seat sublime Jove urged them on. The champain all was fill'd, and with the blaze Illumined wide of men and steeds brass-arm'd, And the incumber'd earth jarr'd under foot Of the encountering hosts. Then, two, the rest Surpassing far, into the midst advanced Impatient for the fight, Anchises' son Æneas, and Achilles, glorious Chief! Æneas first, under his ponderous casque Nodding and menacing, advanced; before His breast he held the well-conducted orb Of his broad shield, and shook his brazen spear. On the other side, Achilles to the fight Flew like a ravening lion, on whose death Resolved the peasants from all quarters meet; He, viewing with disdain the foremost, stalks Right on, but smitten by some dauntless youth Writhes himself, and discloses his huge fangs Hung with white foam; then, growling for revenge, Lashes himself to battle with his tail, Till with a burning eye and a bold heart He springs to slaughter, or himself is slain; So, by his valour and his noble mind Impell'd, renown'd Achilles moved toward Æneas, and, small interval between, Thus spake the Hero matchless in the race. Why stand'st thou here, Æneas! thy own band Left at such distance? Is it that thine heart Glows with ambition to contend with me In hope of Priam's honours, and to fill His throne hereafter in Troy steed-renown'd? But shouldst thou slay me, not for that exploit Would Priam such large recompense bestow, For he hath sons, and hath, beside, a mind And disposition not so lightly changed. Or have the Trojans of their richest soil For vineyard apt or plough assign'd thee part If thou shalt slay me? Difficult, I hope, At least, thou shalt experience that emprize. For, as I think, I have already chased Thee with my spear. Forgettest thou the day When, finding thee alone, I drove thee down Headlong from Ida, and, thy cattle left Afar, thou didst not dare in all thy flight Turn once, till at Lyrnessus safe arrived, Which city by Jove's aid and by the aid Of Pallas I destroy'd, and captive led Their women? Thee, indeed, the Gods preserved, But they shall not preserve thee, as thou dream'st, Now also. Back into thy host again; Hence, I command thee, nor oppose in fight My force, lest evil find thee. To be taught By sufferings only is the part of fools. To whom Æneas answer thus return'd. Pelides! hope not, as I were a boy, With words to scare me. I have also taunts At my command, and could be sharp as thou. By such report as from the lips of men We oft have heard, each other's birth we know And parents; but my parents to behold Was ne'er thy lot, nor have I thine beheld. Thee men proclaim from noble Peleus sprung And Thetis, bright-hair'd Goddess of the Deep; I boast myself of lovely Venus born To brave Anchises, and his son this day In battle slain thy Sire shall mourn, or mine; For I expect not that we shall depart Like children, satisfied with words alone. But if it please thee more at large to learn My lineage (thousands can attest it true) Know this. Jove, Sovereign of the storms, begat Dardanus, and ere yet the sacred walls Of Ilium rose, the glory of this plain, He built Dardania; for at Ida's foot Dwelt our progenitors in ancient days. Dardanus was the father of a son, King Ericthonius, wealthiest of mankind. Three thousand mares of his the marish grazed, Each suckling with delight her tender foal. Boreas, enamour'd of no few of these, The pasture sought, and cover'd them in form Of a steed azure-maned. They, pregnant thence, Twelve foals produced, and all so light of foot, That when they wanton'd in the fruitful field They swept, and snapp'd it not, the golden ear, And when they wanton'd on the boundless Deep, They skimm'd the green wave's frothy ridge, secure. From Ericthonius sprang Tros, King of Troy, And Tros was father of three famous sons, Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymede Loveliest of human-kind, whom for his charms The Gods caught up to heaven, there to abide With the Immortals, cup-bearer of Jove. Ilus begat Laomedon, and he Five sons, Tithonus, Priam, Clytius, Lampus, and Hicetaon, branch of Mars. Assaracus a son begat, by name Capys, and Capys in due time his son Warlike Anchises, and Anchises me. But Priam is the noble Hector's sire. Such is my lineage, and such blood I boast; But valour is from Jove; He, as he wills, Increases or reduces it in man, For He is Lord of all. Therefore enough— Too long like children we have stood, the time Consuming here, while battle roars around. Reproach is cheap. Easily might we cast Gibes at each other, till a ship that asks An hundred oars should sink beneath the load. The tongue of man is voluble, hath words For every theme, nor wants wide field and long, And as he speaks so shall he hear again. But we—why should we wrangle, and with taunts Assail each other, as the practice is Of women, who with heart-devouring strife On fire, start forth into the public way To mock each other, uttering, as may chance, Much truth, much falsehood, as their anger bids? The ardour of my courage will not slack For all thy speeches; we must combat first; Now, therefore, without more delay, begin, That we may taste each other's force in arms. So spake Æneas, and his brazen lance Hurl'd with full force against the dreadful shield. Loud roar'd its ample concave at the blow. Not unalarm'd Pelides his broad disk Thrust farther from him, deeming that the force Of such an arm should pierce his guard with ease. Vain fear! he recollected not that arms Glorious as his, gifts of the Immortal Gods, Yield not so quickly to the force of man. The stormy spear by brave Æneas sent, No passage found; the golden plate divine Repress'd its vehemence; two folds it pierced, But three were still behind, for with five folds Vulcan had fortified it; two were brass; The two interior, tin; the midmost, gold; And at the golden one the weapon stood Some commentators, supposing the golden plate the outermost as the most ornamental, have perplexed themselves much with this passage, for how, say they, could two folds be pierced and the spear be stopped by the gold, if the gold lay on the surface? But to avoid the difficulty, we need only suppose that the gold was inserted between the two plates of brass and the two of tin, Vulcan, in this particular, having attended less to ornament than to security. See the Scholiast in Villoisson, who argues at large in favour of this opinion.. Achilles, next, hurl'd his long shadow'd spear, And struck Æneas on the utmost verge Of his broad shield, where thinnest lay the brass, And thinnest the ox-hide. The Pelian ash Started right through the buckler, and it rang. Æneas crouch'd terrified, and his shield Thrust farther from him; but the rapid beam Bursting both borders of the ample disk, Glanced o'er his back, and plunged into the soil. He 'scaped it, and he stood; but, as he stood, With horror infinite the weapon saw Planted so near him. Then, Achilles drew His faulchion keen, and with a deafening shout Sprang on him; but Æneas seized a stone Heavy and huge, a weight to overcharge Two men (such men as are accounted strong Now) but He wielded it with ease, alone. Then had Æneas, as Achilles came Impetuous on, smitten, although in vain, His helmet or his shield, and Peleus' son Had with his faulchion him stretch'd at his feet, But that the God of Ocean quick perceived His peril, and the Immortals thus bespake. I pity brave Æneas, who shall soon, Slain by Achilles, see the realms below, By smooth suggestions of Apollo lured To danger, such as He can ne'er avert. But wherefore should the Chief, guiltless himself, Die for the fault of others? at no time His gifts have fail'd, grateful to all in heaven. Come, therefore, and let us from death ourselves Rescue him, lest if by Achilles' arm This Hero perish, Jove himself be wroth; For he is destined to survive, lest all The house of Dardanus (whom Jove beyond All others loved, his sons of woman born) Fail with Æneas, and be found no more. Saturnian Jove hath hated now long time The family of Priam, and henceforth Æneas and his son, and his sons' sons, Shall sway the sceptre o'er the race of Troy. To whom, majestic thus the spouse of Jove. Neptune! deliberate thyself, and chuse Whether to save Æneas, or to leave The Hero victim of Achilles' ire. For Pallas and myself oftimes have sworn In full assembly of the Gods, to aid Troy never, never to avert the day Of her distress, not even when the flames Kindled by the heroic sons of Greece, Shall climb with fury to her topmost towers. She spake; then Neptune, instant, through the throng Of battle flying, and the clash of spears, Came where Achilles and Æneas fought. At once with shadows dim he blurr'd the sight Of Peleus' son, and from the shield, himself, Of brave Æneas the bright-pointed ash Retracting, placed it at Achilles' feet. Then, lifting high Æneas from the ground, He heaved him far remote; o'er many a rank Of Heroes and of bounding steeds he flew, Launch'd into air from the expanded palm Of Neptune, and alighted in the rear Of all the battle where the Caucons stood. Neptune approach'd him there, and at his side Standing, in accents wing'd, him thus bespake. What God, Æneas! tempted thee to cope Thus inconsiderately with the son Of Peleus, both more excellent in fight Than thou, and more the favourite of the skies? From him retire hereafter, or expect A premature descent into the shades. But when Achilles shall have once fulfill'd His destiny, in battle slain, then fight Fearless, for thou canst fall by none beside. So saying, he left the well-admonish'd Chief, And from Achilles' eyes scatter'd the gloom Shed o'er them by himself. The Hero saw Clearly, and with his noble heart, incensed By disappointment, thus conferring, said. Gods! I behold a prodigy. My spear Lies at my foot, and He at whom I cast The weapon with such deadly force, is gone! Æneas therefore, as it seems, himself Interests the Immortal Gods, although I deem'd his boast of their protection vain. I reck not. Let him go. So gladly 'scaped From slaughter now, he shall not soon again Feel an ambition to contend with me. Now will I rouse the Danaï, and prove The force in fight of many a Trojan more. He said, and sprang to battle with loud voice, Calling the Greecians after him.—Ye sons Of the Achaians! stand not now aloof, My noble friends! but foot to foot let each Fall on courageous, and desire the fight. The task were difficult for me alone, Brave as I boast myself, to chase a foe So numerous, and to combat with them all. Not Mars himself, immortal though he be, Nor Pallas, could with all the ranks contend Of this vast multitude, and drive the whole. With hands, with feet, with spirit and with might, All that I can I will; right through I go, And not a Trojan who shall chance within Spear's reach of me, shall, as I judge, rejoice. Thus he the Greeks exhorted. Opposite, Meantime, illustrious Hector to his host Vociferated, his design to oppose Achilles publishing in every ear. Fear not, ye valiant men of Troy! fear not The son of Peleus. In a war of words I could, myself, cope even with the Gods; But not with spears; there they excel us all. Nor shall Achilles full performance give To all his vaunts, but, if he some fulfil, Shall others leave mutilate in the midst. I will encounter him, though his hands be fire, Though fire his hands, and his heart hammer'd steel. So spake he them exhorting. At his word Uprose the Trojan spears, thick intermixt The battle join'd, and clamour loud began. Then thus, approaching Hector, Phœbus spake. Henceforth, advance not Hector! in the front Seeking Achilles, but retired within The stormy multitude his coming wait, Lest his spear reach thee, or his glittering sword. He said, and Hector far into his host Withdrew, admonish'd by the voice divine. Then, shouting terrible, and clothed with might, Achilles sprang to battle. First, he slew The valiant Chief Iphition, whom a band Numerous obey'd. Otrynteus was his Sire. Him to Otrynteus, city-waster Chief, A Naiad under snowy Tmolus bore In fruitful Hyda. Right into his front As he advanced, Achilles drove his spear, And rived his skull; with thundering sound he fell, And thus the conqueror gloried in his fall. Ah Otryntides! thou art slain. Here lies The terrible in arms, who born beside The broad Gygæan lake, where Hyllus flows And Hermus, call'd the fertile soil his own. Thus gloried he. Meantime the shades of death Cover'd Iphition, and Achaian wheels And horses ground his body in the van. Demoleon next, Antenor's son, a brave Defender of the walls of Troy, he slew. Into his temples through his brazen casque He thrust the Pelian ash, nor could the brass Such force resist, but the huge weapon drove The shatter'd bone into his inmost brain, And his fierce onset at a stroke repress'd. Hippodamas his weapon next received Within his spine, while with a leap he left His steeds and fled. He, panting forth his life, Moan'd like a bull, by consecrated youths Dragg'd round the Heliconian King Neptune. So called, either because he was worshipped on Helicon, a mountain of Bœotia, or from Helice, an island of Achaia, where he had a temple., who views That victim with delight. So, with loud moans The noble warrior sigh'd his soul away. Then, spear in hand, against the godlike son Of Priam, Polydorus, he advanced. Not yet his father had to him indulged A warrior's place, for that of all his sons He was the youngest-born, his hoary Sire's Chief darling, and in speed surpass'd them all. Then also, in the vanity of youth, For show of nimbleness, he started oft Into the vaward, till at last he fell. Him gliding swiftly by, swifter than he Achilles with a javelin reach'd; he struck His belt behind him, where the golden clasps Met, and the double hauberk interposed. The point transpierced his bowels, and sprang through His navel; screaming, on his knees he fell, Death-shadows dimm'd his eyes, and with both hands, Stooping, he press'd his gather'd bowels back. But noble Hector, soon as he beheld His brother Polydorus to the earth Inclined, and with his bowels in his hands, Sightless well-nigh with anguish could endure No longer to remain aloof; flame-like He burst abroad, and shaking his sharp spear, Advanced to meet Achilles, whose approach Seeing, Achilles bounded with delight, And thus, exulting, to himself he said. Ah! he approaches, who hath stung my soul Deepest, the slayer of whom most I loved! Behold, we meet! Caution is at an end, And timid skulking in the walks of war. He ceased, and with a brow knit into frowns, Call'd to illustrious Hector. Haste, approach, That I may quick dispatch thee to the shades. Whom answer'd warlike Hector nought appall'd. Pelides! hope not, as I were a boy, With words to scare me. I have also taunts At my command, and can be sharp as thou. I know thee valiant, and myself I know Inferior far; yet, whether thou shalt slay Me, or, inferior as I am, be slain By me, is at the pleasure of the Gods, For I wield also not a pointless beam. He said, and, brandishing it, hurl'd his spear, Which Pallas, breathing softly, wafted back From the renown'd Achilles, and it fell Successless at illustrious Hector's feet. Then, all on fire to slay him, with a shout That rent the air Achilles rapid flew Toward him; but him wrapt in clouds opaque Apollo caught with ease divine away. Thrice, swift Achilles sprang to the assault Impetuous, thrice the pitchy cloud he smote, And at his fourth assault, godlike in act, And terrible in utterance, thus exclaim'd. Dog! thou art safe, and hast escaped again; But narrowly, and by the aid once more Of Phœbus, without previous suit to whom Thou venturest never where the javelin sings. But when we next encounter, then expect, If one of all in heaven aid also me, To close thy proud career. Meantime I seek Some other, and assail e'en whom I may. So saying, he pierced the neck of Dryops through, And at his feet he fell. Him there he left, And turning on a valiant warrior huge, Philetor's son, Demuchus, in the knee Pierced, and detain'd him by the planted spear, Till with his sword he smote him, and he died. Laogonus and Dardanus he next Assaulted, sons of Bias; to the ground Dismounting both, one with his spear he slew, The other with his faulchion at a blow. Tros too, Alastor's son—He suppliant clasp'd Achilles' knees, and for his pity sued, Pleading equality of years, in hope That he would spare, and send him thence alive. Ah dreamer! ignorant how much in vain That suit he urged; for not of milky mind, Or placable in temper was the Chief To whom he sued, but fiery. With both hands His knees he clasp'd importunate, and he Fast by the liver gash'd him with his sword. His liver falling forth, with sable blood His bosom fill'd, and darkness veil'd his eyes. Then, drawing close to Mulius, in his ear He set the pointed brass, and at a thrust Sent it, next moment, through his ear beyond. Then, through the forehead of Agenor's son Echechlus, his huge-hafted blade he drove, And death and fate for ever veil'd his eyes. Next, where the tendons of the elbow meet, Striking Deucalion, through his wrist he urged The brazen point; he all defenceless stood, Expecting death; down came Achilles' blade Full on his neck; away went head and casque Together; from his spine the marrow sprang, And at his length outstretch'd he press'd the plain. From him to Rhigmus, Pireus' noble son, He flew, a warrior from the fields of Thrace. Him through the loins he pierced, and with the beam Fixt in his bowels, to the earth he fell; Then piercing, as he turn'd to flight, the spine Of Areithöus his charioteer, He thrust him from his seat; wild with dismay Back flew the fiery coursers at his fall. As a devouring fire within the glens Of some dry mountain ravages the trees, While, blown around, the flames roll to all sides, So, on all sides, terrible as a God, Achilles drove the death-devoted host Of Ilium, and the champain ran with blood. As when the peasant his yoked steers employs To tread his barley, the broad-fronted pair With ponderous hoofs trample it out with ease, So, by magnanimous Achilles driven, His coursers solid-hoof'd stamp'd as they ran The shields, at once, and bodies of the slain; Blood spatter'd all his axle, and with blood From the horse-hoofs and from the fellied wheels His chariot redden'd, while himself, athirst For glory, his unconquerable hands Defiled with mingled carnage, sweat, and dust. BOOK XXI. ARGUMENT OF THE TWENTY-FIRST BOOK. Achilles having separated the Trojans, and driven one part of them to the city and the other into the Scamander, takes twelve young men alive, his intended victims to the manes of Patroclus. The river overflowing his banks with purpose to overwhelm him, is opposed by Vulcan, and gladly relinquishes the attempt. The battle of the Gods ensues. Apollo, in the form of Agenor, decoys Achilles from the town, which in the mean time the Trojans enter and shut the gates against him. But when they came, at length, where Xanthus winds His stream vortiginous from Jove derived, There, separating Ilium's host, he drove Part o'er the plain to Troy in the same road By which the Greecians had so lately fled The fury of illustrious Hector's arm. That way they fled pouring themselves along Flood-like, and Juno, to retard them, threw Darkness as night before them. Other part, Push'd down the sides of Xanthus, headlong plunged With dashing sound into his dizzy stream, And all his banks re-echoed loud the roar. They, struggling, shriek'd in silver eddies whirl'd. As when, by violence of fire expell'd, Locusts uplifted on the wing escape To some broad river, swift the sudden blaze Pursues them, they, astonish'd, strew the flood, So, by Achilles driven, a mingled throng Of horses and of warriors overspread Xanthus, and glutted all his sounding course. He, chief of heroes, leaving on the bank His spear against a tamarisk reclined Plunged like a God, with faulchion arm'd alone, But fill'd with thoughts of havoc. On all sides Down came his edge; groans follow'd dread to hear Of warriors smitten by the sword, and all The waters as they ran redden'd with blood. As smaller fishes, flying the pursuit Of some huge dolphin, terrified, the creeks And secret hollows of a haven fill, For none of all that he can seize he spares, So lurk'd the trembling Trojans in the caves Of Xanthus' awful flood. But He (his hands Wearied at length with slaughter) from the rest Twelve youths selected whom to death he doom'd, In vengeance for his loved Patroclus slain. Them stupified with dread like fawns he drove Forth form the river, manacling their hands Behind them fast with their own tunic-strings, And gave them to his warrior train in charge. Then, ardent still for blood, rushing again Toward the stream, Dardanian Priam's son He met, Lycaon, as he climb'd the bank. Him erst by night, in his own father's field Finding him, he had led captive away. Lycaon was employ'd cutting green shoots Of the wild-fig for chariot-rings, when lo! Terrible, unforeseen, Achilles came. He seized and sent him in a ship afar To Lemnos; there the son of Jason pay'd His price, and, at great cost, Eëtion The guest of Jason, thence redeeming him, Sent him to fair Arisba; but he 'scaped Thence also, and regain'd his father's house. Eleven days, at his return, he gave To recreation joyous with his friends, And on the twelfth his fate cast him again Into Achilles' hands, who to the shades Now doom'd him, howsoever loth to go. Soon as Achilles swiftest of the swift Him naked saw (for neither spear had he Nor shield nor helmet, but, when he emerged, Weary and faint had cast them all away) Indignant to his mighty self he said. Gods! I behold a miracle! Ere long The valiant Trojans whom myself have slain Shall rise from Erebus, for he is here, The self-same warrior whom I lately sold At Lemnos, free, and in the field again. The hoary Deep is prison strong enough For most, but not for him. Now shall he taste The point of this my spear, that I may learn By sure experience, whether hell itself That holds the strongest fast, can him detain, Or whether he shall thence also escape. While musing thus he stood, stunn'd with dismay The youth approach'd, eager to clasp his knees, For vehement he felt the dread of death Working within him; with his Pelian ash Uplifted high noble Achilles stood Ardent to smite him; he with body bent Ran under it, and to his knees adhered; The weapon, missing him, implanted stood Close at his back, when, seizing with one hand Achilles' knees, he with the other grasp'd The dreadful beam, resolute through despair, And in wing'd accents suppliant thus began. Oh spare me! pity me! Behold I clasp Thy knees, Achilles! Ah, illustrious Chief! Reject not with disdain a suppliant's prayer. I am thy guest also, who at thy own board Have eaten bread, and did partake the gift Of Ceres with thee on the very day When thou didst send me in yon field surprised For sale to sacred Lemnos, far remote, And for my price receiv'dst an hundred beeves. Loose me, and I will yield thee now that sum Thrice told. Alas! this morn is but the twelfth Since, after numerous hardships, I arrived Once more in Troy, and now my ruthless lot Hath given me into thy hands again. Jove cannot less than hate me, who hath twice Made me thy prisoner, and my doom was death, Death in my prime, the day when I was born Son of Laothöe from Alta sprung, From Alta, whom the Leleges obey On Satnio's banks in lofty Pedasus. His daughter to his other numerous wives King Priam added, and two sons she bore Only to be deprived by thee of both. My brother hath already died, in front Of Ilium's infantry, by thy bright spear, The godlike Polydorus; and like doom Shall now be mine, for I despair to escape Thine hands, to which the Gods yield me again. But hear and mark me well. My birth was not From the same womb as Hector's, who hath slain Thy valiant friend for clemency renown'd. Such supplication the illustrious son Of Priam made, but answer harsh received. Fool! speak'st of ransom? Name it not to me. For till my friend his miserable fate Accomplish'd, I was somewhat given to spare, And numerous, whom I seized alive, I sold. But now, of all the Trojans whom the Gods Deliver to me, none shall death escape, 'Specially of the house of Priam, none. Die, therefore, even thou, my friend! What mean Thy tears unreasonably shed and vain? Died not Patroclus, braver far than thou? And look on me,—see'st not to what an height My stature towers, and what a bulk I boast? A King begat me, and a Goddess bore. What then! A death by violence awaits Me also, and at morn, or eve, or noon, I perish, whensoe'er the destined spear Shall reach me, or the arrow from the nerve. He ceased, and where the suppliant kneel'd, he died. Quitting the spear, with both hands spread abroad He sat, but swift Achilles with his sword 'Twixt neck and key-bone smote him, and his blade Of double edge sank all into the wound. He prone extended on the champain lay Bedewing with his sable blood the glebe, Till, by the foot, Achilles cast him far Into the stream, and, as he floated down, Thus in wing'd accents, glorying, exclaim'd. Lie there, and feed the fishes, which shall lick Thy blood secure. Thy mother ne'er shall place Thee on thy bier, nor on thy body weep, But swift Scamander on his giddy tide Shall bear thee to the bosom of the sea. There, many a fish shall through the crystal flood Ascending to the rippled surface, find Lycaon's pamper'd flesh delicious fare. Die Trojans! till we reach your city, you Fleeing, and slaughtering, I. This pleasant stream Of dimpling silver which ye worship oft With victim bulls, and sate with living steeds His rapid whirlpools, shall avail you nought, But ye shall die, die terribly, till all Shall have requited me with just amends For my Patroclus, and for other Greeks Slain at the ships while I declined the war. He ended, at whose words still more incensed Scamander means devised, thenceforth to check Achilles, and avert the doom of Troy. Meantime the son of Peleus, his huge spear Grasping, assail'd Asteropæus son Of Pelegon, on fire to take his life. Fair Peribœa, daughter eldest-born Of Acessamenus, his father bore To broad-stream'd Axius, who had clasp'd the nymph In his embrace. On him Achilles sprang. He newly risen from the river, stood Arm'd with two lances opposite, for him Xanthus embolden'd, at the deaths incensed Of many a youth whom, mercy none vouchsafed, Achilles had in all his current slain. And now small distance interposed, they faced Each other, when Achilles thus began. Who art and whence, who dar'st encounter me? Hapless the sires whose sons my force defy. To whom the noble son of Pelegon. Pelides, mighty Chief! Why hast thou ask'd My derivation? From the land I come Of mellow-soil'd Pœonia far remote, Chief leader of Pœonia's host spear-arm'd; This day hath also the eleventh risen Since I at Troy arrived. For my descent, It is from Axius river wide-diffused, From Axius, fairest stream that waters earth, Sire of bold Pelegon whom men report My sire. Let this suffice. Now fight, Achilles! So spake he threatening, and Achilles raised Dauntless the Pelian ash. At once two spears The hero bold, Asteropæus threw, With both hands apt for battle. One his shield Struck but pierced not, impeded by the gold, Gift of a God; the other as it flew Grazed his right elbow; sprang the sable blood; But, overflying him, the spear in earth Stood planted deep, still hungering for the prey. Then, full at the Pœonian Peleus' son Hurl'd forth his weapon with unsparing force But vain; he struck the sloping river-bank, And mid-length deep stood plunged the ashen beam. Then, with his faulchion drawn, Achilles flew To smite him; he in vain, meantime, essay'd To pluck the rooted spear forth from the bank; Thrice with full force he shook the beam, and thrice, Although reluctant, left it; at his fourth Last effort, bending it he sought to break The ashen spear-beam of Æacides, But perish'd by his keen-edged faulchion first; For on the belly at his navel's side He smote him; to the ground effused fell all His bowels, death's dim shadows veil'd his eyes. Achilles ardent on his bosom fix'd His foot, despoil'd him, and exulting cried. Lie there; though River-sprung thou find'st it hard To cope with sons of Jove omnipotent. Thou said'st, a mighty River is my sire— But my descent from mightier Jove I boast; My father, whom the Myrmidons obey, Is son of Æacus, and he of Jove. As Jove all streams excels that seek the sea, So, Jove's descendents nobler are than theirs. Behold a River at thy side—Let Him Afford thee, if he can, some succour—No— He may not fight against Saturnian Jove. Therefore, not kingly Acheloïus, Nor yet the strength of Ocean's vast profound, Although from Him all rivers and all seas All fountains and all wells proceed, may boast Comparison with Jove, but even He Astonish'd trembles at his fiery bolt, And his dread thunders rattling in the sky. He said, and drawing from the bank his spear, Asteropæus left stretch'd on the sands, Where, while the clear wave dash'd him, eels his flanks And ravening fishes numerous nibbled bare. The horsed Pœonians next he fierce assail'd, Who seeing their brave Chief slain by the sword And forceful arm of Peleus' son, beside The eddy-whirling stream fled all dispersed. Thersilochus and Mydon then he slew, Thrasius, Astypylus and Ophelestes, Ænius and Mnesus; nor had these sufficed Achilles, but Pœonians more had fallen, Had not the angry River from within His circling gulfs in semblance of a man Call'd to him, interrupting thus his rage. Oh both in courage and injurious deeds Unmatch'd, Achilles! whom themselves the Gods Cease not to aid, if Saturn's son have doom'd All Ilium's race to perish by thine arm, Expel them, first, from me, ere thou atchieve That dread exploit; for, cumber'd as I am With bodies, I can pour my pleasant stream No longer down into the sacred Deep; All vanish where thou comest. But oh desist Dread Chief! Amazement fills me at thy deeds. To whom Achilles, matchless in the race. River divine! hereafter be it so. But not from slaughter of this faithless host I cease, till I shall shut them fast in Troy And trial make of Hector, if his arm In single fight shall strongest prove, or mine. He said, and like a God, furious, again Assail'd the Trojans; then the circling Flood To Phœbus thus his loud complaint address'd. Ah son of Jove, God of the silver bow! The mandate of the son of Saturn ill Hast thou perform'd, who, earnest, bade thee aid The Trojans, till (the sun sunk in the West) Night's shadow dim should veil the fruitful field. He ended, and Achilles spear-renown'd Plunged from the bank into the middle stream. Then, turbulent, the River all his tide Stirr'd from the bottom, landward heaving off The numerous bodies that his current choak'd Slain by Achilles; them, as with the roar Of bulls, he cast aground, but deep within His oozy gulfs the living safe conceal'd. Terrible all around Achilles stood The curling wave, then, falling on his shield Dash'd him, nor found his footsteps where to rest. An elm of massy trunk he seized and branch Luxuriant, but it fell torn from the root And drew the whole bank after it; immersed It damm'd the current with its ample boughs, And join'd as with a bridge the distant shores. Upsprang Achilles from the gulf and turn'd His feet, now wing'd for flight, into the plain Astonish'd; but the God, not so appeased, Arose against him with a darker curl ??????????????—The beauty and force of this word are wonderful; I have in vain endeavoured to do it justice., That he might quell him and deliver Troy. Back flew Achilles with a bound, the length Of a spear's cast, for such a spring he own'd As bears the black-plumed eagle on her prey Strongest and swiftest of the fowls of air. Like Her he sprang, and dreadful on his chest Clang'd his bright armour. Then, with course oblique He fled his fierce pursuer, but the flood, Fly where he might, came thundering in his rear. As when the peasant with his spade a rill Conducts from some pure fountain through his grove Or garden, clearing the obstructed course, The pebbles, as it runs, all ring beneath, And, as the slope still deepens, swifter still It runs, and, murmuring, outstrips the guide, So Him, though swift, the River always reach'd Still swifter; who can cope with power divine? Oft as the noble Chief, turning, essay'd Resistance, and to learn if all the Gods Alike rush'd after him, so oft the flood, Jove's offspring, laved his shoulders. Upward then He sprang distress'd, but with a sidelong sweep Assailing him, and from beneath his steps Wasting the soil, the Stream his force subdued. Then looking to the skies, aloud he mourn'd. Eternal Sire! forsaken by the Gods I sink, none deigns to save me from the flood, From which once saved, I would no death decline. Yet blame I none of all the Powers of heaven As Thetis; she with falsehood sooth'd my soul, She promised me a death by Phœbus' shafts Swift-wing'd, beneath the battlements of Troy. I would that Hector, noblest of his race, Had slain me, I had then bravely expired And a brave man had stripp'd me of my arms. But Fate now dooms me to a death abhorr'd Whelm'd in deep waters, like a swine-herd's boy Drown'd in wet weather while he fords a brook. So spake Achilles; then, in human form, Minerva stood and Neptune at his side; Each seized his hand confirming him, and thus The mighty Shaker of the shores began. Achilles! moderate thy dismay, fear nought. In us behold, in Pallas and in me, Effectual aids, and with consent of Jove; For to be vanquish'd by a River's force Is not thy doom. This foe shall soon be quell'd; Thine eyes shall see it. Let our counsel rule Thy deed, and all is well. Cease not from war Till fast within proud Ilium's walls her host Again be prison'd, all who shall escape; Then (Hector slain) to the Achaian fleet Return; we make the glorious victory thine. So they, and both departing sought the skies. Then, animated by the voice divine, He moved toward the plain now all o'erspread By the vast flood on which the bodies swam And shields of many a youth in battle slain. He leap'd, he waded, and the current stemm'd Right onward, by the flood in vain opposed, With such might Pallas fill'd him. Nor his rage Scamander aught repress'd, but still the more Incensed against Achilles, curl'd aloft His waters, and on Simoïs call'd aloud. Brother! oh let us with united force Check, if we may, this warrior; he shall else Soon lay the lofty towers of Priam low, Whose host, appall'd, defend them now no more. Haste—succour me—Thy channel fill with streams From all thy fountains; call thy torrents down; Lift high the waters; mingle trees and stones With uproar wild, that we may quell the force Of this dread Chief triumphant now, and fill'd With projects that might more beseem a God. But vain shall be his strength, his beauty nought Shall profit him or his resplendent arms, For I will bury them in slime and ooze, And I will overwhelm himself with soil, Sands heaping o'er him and around him sands Infinite, that no Greek shall find his bones For ever, in my bottom deep immersed. There shall his tomb be piled, nor other earth, At his last rites, his friends shall need for Him. He said, and lifting high his angry tide Vortiginous, against Achilles hurl'd, Roaring, the foam, the bodies, and the blood; Then all his sable waves divine again Accumulating, bore him swift along. Shriek'd Juno at that sight, terrified lest Achilles in the whirling deluge sunk Should perish, and to Vulcan quick exclaim'd. Vulcan, my son, arise; for we account Xanthus well able to contend with thee. Give instant succour; show forth all thy fires. Myself will haste to call the rapid South And Zephyrus, that tempests from the sea Blowing, thou may'st both arms and dead consume With hideous conflagration. Burn along The banks of Xanthus, fire his trees and Him Seize also. Let him by no specious guile Of flattery sooth thee, or by threats appall, Nor slack thy furious fires 'till with a shout I give command, then bid them cease to blaze. She spake, and Vulcan at her word his fires Shot dreadful forth; first, kindling on the field, He burn'd the bodies strew'd numerous around Slain by Achilles; arid grew the earth And the flood ceased. As when a sprightly breeze Autumnal blowing from the North, at once Dries the new-water'd garden, The reason given in the Scholium is, that the surface being hardened by the wind the moisture remains unexhaled from beneath, and has time to saturate the roots. —See Villoisson. gladdening him Who tills the soil, so was the champain dried; The dead consumed, against the River, next, He turn'd the fierceness of his glittering fires. Willows and tamarisks and elms he burn'd, Burn'd lotus, rushes, reeds; all plants and herbs That clothed profuse the margin of his slood. His eels and fishes, whether wont to dwell In gulfs beneath, or tumble in the stream, All languish'd while the Artist of the skies Breath'd on them; even Xanthus lost, himself, All force, and, suppliant, Vulcan thus address'd. Oh Vulcan! none in heaven itself may cope With thee. I yield to thy consuming fires. Cease, cease. I reck not if Achilles drive Her citizens, this moment, forth from Troy, For what are war and war's concerns to me? So spake he scorch'd, and all his waters boil'd. As some huge cauldron hisses urged by force Of circling fires and fill'd with melted lard, The unctuous fluid overbubbling ?????????. streams On all sides, while the dry wood flames beneath, So Xanthus bubbled and his pleasant flood Hiss'd in the fire, nor could he longer flow But check'd his current, with hot steams annoy'd By Vulcan raised. His supplication, then, Importunate to Juno thus he turn'd. Ah Juno! why assails thy son my streams, Hostile to me alone? Of all who aid The Trojans I am surely least to blame, Yet even I desist if thou command; And let thy son cease also; for I swear That never will I from the Trojans turn Their evil day, not even when the host Of Greece shall set all Ilium in a blaze. He said, and by his oath pacified, thus The white-arm'd Deity to Vulcan spake. Peace, glorious son! we may not in behalf Of mortal man thus longer vex a God. Then Vulcan his tremendous fires repress'd, And down into his gulfy channel rush'd The refluent flood; for when the force was once Subdued of Xanthus, Juno interposed, Although incensed, herself to quell the strife. But contest vehement the other Gods Now waged, each breathing discord; loud they rush'd And fierce to battle, while the boundless earth Quaked under them, and, all around, the heavens Sang them together with a trumpet's voice. Jove listening, on the Olympian summit sat Well-pleased, and, in his heart laughing for joy, Beheld the Powers of heaven in battle join'd. Not long aloof they stood. Shield-piercer Mars His brazen spear grasp'd, and began the fight Rushing on Pallas, whom he thus reproach'd. Wasp! front of impudence, and past all bounds Audacious! Why impellest thou the Gods To fight? Thy own proud spirit is the cause. Remember'st not, how, urged by thee, the son Of Tydeus, Diomede, myself assail'd, When thou, the radiant spear with thy own hand Guiding, didst rend my body? Now, I ween, The hour is come in which I shall exact Vengeance for all thy malice shown to me. So saying, her shield he smote tassell'd around Terrific, proof against the bolts of Jove; That shield gore-tainted Mars with fury smote. But she, retiring, with strong grasp upheaved A rugged stone, black, ponderous, from the plain, A land-mark fixt by men of ancient times, Which hurling at the neck of stormy Mars She smote him. Down he fell. Seven acres, stretch'd, He overspread, his ringlets in the dust Polluted lay, and dreadful rang his arms. The Goddess laugh'd, and thus in accents wing'd With exultation, as he lay, exclaim'd. Fool! Art thou still to learn how far my force Surpasses thine, and darest thou cope with me? Now feel the furies of thy mother's ire Who hates thee for thy treachery to the Greeks, And for thy succour given to faithless Troy. She said, and turn'd from Mars her glorious eyes. But him deep-groaning and his torpid powers Recovering slow, Venus conducted thence Daughter of Jove, whom soon as Juno mark'd, In accents wing'd to Pallas thus she spake. Daughter invincible of glorious Jove! Haste—follow her—Ah shameless! how she leads Gore-tainted Mars through all the host of heaven. So she, whom Pallas with delight obey'd; To Venus swift she flew, and on the breast With such force smote her that of sense bereft The fainting Goddess fell. There Venus lay And Mars extended on the fruitful glebe, And Pallas thus in accents wing'd exclaim'd. I would that all who on the part of Troy Oppose in fight Achaia's valiant sons, Were firm and bold as Venus in defence Of Mars, for whom she dared my power defy! So had dissention (Ilium overthrown And desolated) ceased long since in heaven. So Pallas, and approving Juno smiled. Then the Imperial Shaker of the shores Thus to Apollo. Phœbus! wherefore stand We thus aloof? Since others have begun, Begin we also; shame it were to both Should we, no combat waged, ascend again Olympus and the brass-built hall of Jove. Begin, for thou art younger; me, whose years Alike and knowledge thine surpass so far, It suits not. Oh stupidity! how gross Art thou and senseless! Are no traces left In thy remembrance of our numerous wrongs Sustain'd at Ilium, when, of all the Gods Ourselves alone, by Jove's commandment, served For stipulated hire, a year complete, Our task-master the proud Laomedon? Myself a bulwark'd town, spacious, secure Against assault, and beautiful as strong Built for the Trojans, and thine office was To feed for King Laomedon his herds Among the groves of Ida many-valed. But when the gladsome hours the season brought Of payment, then the unjust King of Troy Dismiss'd us of our whole reward amerced By violence, and added threats beside. Thee into distant isles, bound hand and foot, To sell he threaten'd, and to amputate The ears of both; we, therefore, hasted thence Resenting deep our promised hire withheld. Aid'st thou for this the Trojans? Canst thou less Than seek, with us, to exterminate the whole Perfidious race, wives, children, husbands, all? To whom the King of radiant shafts Apollo. Me, Neptune, thou wouldst deem, thyself, unwise Contending for the sake of mortal men With thee; a wretched race, who like the leaves Now flourish rank, by fruits of earth sustain'd, Now sapless fall. Here, therefore, us between Let all strife cease, far better left to Them. He said, and turn'd away, fearing to lift His hand against the brother of his sire. But him Diana of the woods with sharp Rebuke, his huntress sister, thus reproved. Fly'st thou, Apollo! and to Neptune yield'st An unearn'd victory, the prize of fame Resigning patient and with no dispute? Fool! wherefore bearest thou the bow in vain? Ah, let me never in my father's courts Hear thee among the Immortals vaunting more That thou would'st Neptune's self confront in arms. So she, to whom Apollo nought replied. But thus the consort of the Thunderer, fired With wrath, reproved the Archeress of heaven. How hast thou dared, impudent, to oppose My will? Bow-practised as thou art, the task To match my force were difficult to thee. Is it, because by ordinance of Jove Thou art a lioness to womankind, Killing them at thy pleasure? Ah beware,— Far easier is it, on the mountain-heights To slay wild beasts and chase the roving hind, Than to conflict with mightier than ourselves. But, if thou wish a lesson on that theme, Approach—Thou shalt be taught with good effect How far my force in combat passes thine. She said, and with her left hand seizing both Diana's wrists, snatch'd suddenly the bow Suspended on her shoulder with the right, And, smiling, smote her with it on the ears. She, writhing oft and struggling, to the ground Shook forth her rapid shafts, then, weeping, fled As to her cavern in some hollow rock The dove, not destined to his talons, flies The hawk's pursuit, and left her arms behind. Then, messenger of heaven, the Argicide Address'd Latona. Combat none with thee, Latona, will I wage. Unsafe it were To cope in battle with a spouse of Jove. Go, therefore, loudly as thou wilt, proclaim To all the Gods that thou hast vanquish'd me. Collecting, then, the bow and arrows fallen In wild disorder on the dusty plain, Latona with the sacred charge withdrew Following her daughter; she, in the abode Brass-built arriving of Olympian Jove, Sat on his knees, weeping till all her robe Ambrosial shook. The mighty Father smiled, And to his bosom straining her, enquired. Daughter beloved! who, which of all the Gods Hath raised his hand, presumptuous, against Thee, As if convicted of some open wrong? To whom the clear-voiced Huntress crescent-crown'd. My Father! Juno, thy own consort fair My sorrow caused, from whom dispute and strife Perpetual, threaten the Immortal Powers. Thus they in heaven mutual conferr'd. Meantime Apollo into sacred Troy return'd Mindful to guard her bulwarks, lest the Greeks Too soon for Fate should desolate the town. The other Gods, some angry, some elate With victory, the Olympian heights regain'd, And sat beside the Thunderer. But the son Of Peleus—He both Trojans slew and steeds. As when in volumes slow smoke climbs the skies From some great city which the Gods have fired Vindictive, sorrow thence to many ensues With mischief, and to all labour severe, So caused Achilles labour, on that day, Severe, and mischief to the men of Troy. But ancient Priam from a sacred tower Stood looking forth, whence soon he noticed vast Achilles, before whom the Trojans fled All courage lost. Descending from the tower With mournful cries and hasting to the wall He thus enjoin'd the keepers of the gates. Hold wide the portals till the flying host Re-enter, for himself is nigh, himself Achilles drives them home. Now, woe to Troy! But soon as safe within the walls received They breathe again, shut fast the ponderous gates At once, lest that destroyer also pass. He said; they, shooting back the bars, threw wide The gates and saved the people, whom to aid Apollo also sprang into the field. They, parch'd with drought and whiten'd all with dust, Flew right toward the town, while, spear in hand, Achilles press'd them, vengeance in his heart And all on fire for glory. Then, full sure, Ilium, the city of lofty gates, had fallen Won by the Greecians, had not Phœbus roused Antenor's valiant son, the noble Chief Agenor; him with dauntless might he fill'd, And shielding him against the stroke of fate Beside him stood himself, by the broad beech Cover'd and wrapt in clouds. Agenor, then, Seeing the city-waster hero nigh Achilles, stood, but standing, felt his mind Troubled with doubts; he groan'd, and thus he mused. Alas! if following the tumultuous flight Of these, I shun Achilles, swifter far He soon will lop my ignominious head. But if, these leaving to be thus dispersed Before him, from the city-wall I fly Across the plain of Troy into the groves Of Ida, and in Ida's thickets lurk, I may, at evening, to the town return Bathed and refresh'd. But whither tend my thoughts? Should he my flight into the plain observe And swift pursuing seize me, then, farewell All hope to 'scape a miserable death, For he hath strength passing the strength of man. How then—shall I withstand him here before The city? He hath also flesh to steel Pervious, within it but a single life, And men report him mortal, howsoe'er Saturnian Jove lift him to glory now. So saying, he turn'd and stood, his dauntless heart Beating for battle. As the pard springs forth To meet the hunter from her gloomy lair, Nor, hearing loud the hounds, fears or retires, But whether from afar or nigh at hand He pierce her first, although transfixt, the fight Still tries, and combats desperate till she fall, So, brave Antenor's son fled not, or shrank, Till he had proved Achilles, but his breast O'ershadowing with his buckler, and his spear Aiming well-poised against him, loud exclaim'd. Renown'd Achilles! Thou art high in hope Doubtless, that thou shalt this day overthrow The city of the glorious sons of Troy. Fool! ye must labour yet ere she be won, For numerous are her citizens and bold, And we will guard her for our parents' sake Our wives and little ones. But here thou diest Terrible Chief and dauntless as thou art. He said, and with full force hurling his lance Smote, and err'd not, his greave beneath the knee. The glittering tin, forged newly, at the stroke Tremendous rang, but quick recoil'd and vain The weapon, weak against that guard divine. Then sprang Achilles in his turn to assail Godlike Agenor, but Apollo took That glory from him, snatching wrapt in clouds Agenor thence, whom calm he sent away. Then Phœbus from pursuit of Ilium's host By art averted Peleus' son; the form Assuming of Agenor, swift he fled Before him, and Achilles swift pursued. While Him Apollo thus lured to the chase Wide o'er the fruitful plain, inclining still Toward Scamander's dizzy stream his course Nor flying far before, but with false hope Always beguiling him, the scatter'd host Meantime, in joyful throngs, regain'd the town. They fill'd and shut it fast, nor dared to wait Each other in the field, or to enquire Who lived and who had fallen, but all, whom flight Had rescued, like a flood pour'd into Troy. BOOK XXII. ARGUMENT OF THE TWENTY-SECOND BOOK. Achilles slays Hector. Thus they, throughout all Troy, like hunted fawns Dispersed, their trickling limbs at leisure cool'd, And, drinking, slaked their fiery thirst, reclined Against the battlements. Meantime, the Greeks Sloping their shields, approach'd the walls of Troy, And Hector, by his adverse fate ensnared, Still stood exposed before the Scæan gate. Then spake Apollo thus to Peleus' son. Wherefore, thyself mortal, pursuest thou me Immortal? oh Achilles! blind with rage, Thou know'st not yet, that thou pursuest a God. Unmindful of thy proper task, to press The flying Trojans, thou hast hither turn'd Devious, and they are all now safe in Troy; Yet hope not me to slay; I cannot die. To whom Achilles swiftest of the swift, Indignant. Oh, of all the Powers above To me most adverse, Archer of the skies! Thou hast beguiled me, leading me away From Ilium far, whence intercepted, else, No few had at this moment gnaw'd the glebe. Thou hast defrauded me of great renown, And, safe thyself, hast rescued them with ease. Ah—had I power, I would requite thee well. So saying, incensed he turned toward the town His rapid course, like some victorious steed That whirls, at stretch, a chariot to the goal. Such seem'd Achilles, coursing light the field. Him, first, the ancient King of Troy perceived Scouring the plain, resplendent as the star Autumnal, of all stars in dead of night Conspicuous most, and named Orion's dog; Brightest it shines, but ominous, and dire Disease portends to miserable man; So beam'd Achilles' armour as he flew. Loud wail'd the hoary King; with lifted hands His head he smote, and, uttering doleful cries Of supplication, sued to his own son. He, fixt before the gate, desirous stood Of combat with Achilles, when his Sire With arms outstretch'd toward him, thus began. My Hector! wait not, oh my son! the approach Of this dread Chief, alone, lest premature Thou die, this moment by Achilles slain, For he is strongest far. Oh that the Gods Him loved as I! then, soon should vultures rend And dogs his carcase, and my grief should cease. He hath unchilded me of many a son, All valiant youths, whom he hath slain or sold To distant isles, and even now, I miss Two sons, whom since the shutting of the gates I find not, Polydorus and Lycaon, My children by Laothöe the fair. If they survive prisoners in yonder camp, I will redeem them with the gold and brass By noble Eltes to his daughter given, Large store, and still reserved. But should they both, Already slain, have journey'd to the shades, We, then, from whom they sprang have cause to mourn And mourn them long, but shorter shall the grief Of Ilium prove, if thou escape and live. Come then, my son! enter the city-gate That thou may'st save us all, nor in thy bloom Of life cut off, enhance Achilles' fame. Commiserate also thy unhappy Sire Ere yet distracted, whom Saturnian Jove Ordains to a sad death, and ere I die To woes innumerable; to behold Sons slaughter'd, daughters ravish'd, torn and stripp'd The matrimonial chamber, infants dash'd Against the ground in dire hostility, And matrons dragg'd by ruthless Greecian hands. Me, haply, last of all, dogs shall devour In my own vestibule, when once the spear Or faulchion of some Greek hath laid me low. The very dogs fed at my table-side, My portal-guards, drinking their master's blood To drunkenness, shall wallow in my courts. Fair falls the warlike youth in battle slain, And when he lies torn by the pointed steel, His death becomes him well; he is secure, Though dead, from shame, whatever next befalls: But when the silver locks and silver beard Of an old man slain by the sword, from dogs Receive dishonour, of all ills that wait On miserable man, that sure is worst. So spake the ancient King, and his grey hairs Pluck'd with both hands, but Hector firm endured. On the other side all tears his mother stood, And lamentation; with one hand she bared, And with the other hand produced her breast, Then in wing'd accents, weeping, him bespake. My Hector! reverence This, and pity me. If ever, drawing forth this breast, thy griefs Of infancy I soothed, oh now, my son! Acknowledge it, and from within the walls Repulse this enemy; stand not abroad To cope with Him, for he is savage-fierce, And should he slay thee, neither shall myself Who bore thee, nor thy noble spouse weep o'er Thy body, but, where we can never come, Dogs shall devour it in the fleet of Greece. So they with prayers importuned, and with tears Their son, but him sway'd not; unmoved he stood, Expecting vast Achilles now at hand. As some fell serpent in his cave expects The traveller's approach, batten'd with herbs Of baneful juice to fury, forth he looks Hideous, and lies coil'd all around his den, So Hector, fill'd with confidence untamed, Fled not, but placing his bright shield against A buttress, with his noble heart conferr'd. Alas for me! should I repass the gate, Polydamas would be the first to heap Reproaches on me, for he bade me lead The Trojans back this last calamitous night In which Achilles rose to arms again. But I refused, although to have complied, Had proved more profitable far; since then By rash resolves of mine I have destroy'd The people, how can I escape the blame Of all in Troy? The meanest there will say— By his self-will he hath destroy'd us all. So shall they speak, and then shall I regret That I return'd ere I had slain in fight Achilles, or that, by Achilles slain, I died not nobly in defence of Troy. But shall I thus? Lay down my bossy shield, Put off my helmet, and my spear recline Against the city wall, then go myself To meet the brave Achilles, and at once Promise him Helen, for whose sake we strive, With all the wealth that Paris in his fleet Brought home, to be restored to Atreus' sons, And to distribute to the Greeks at large All hidden treasures of the town, an oath Taking beside from every senator, That he will nought conceal, but will produce And share in just equality what stores Soever our fair city still includes? Ah airy speculations, questions vain! I may not sue to Him; compassion none Will he vouchsafe me, or my suit respect, But, seeing me unarm'd, will sate at once His rage, and womanlike I shall be slain. It is no time from oak or hollow rock With Him to parley, as a nymph and swain, A nymph and swain The repetition follows the Original, and the Scholiast is of opinion that Homer uses it here that he may express more emphatically the length to which such conferences are apt to proceed.—??? ??? ?????????? ?? ???????? ????????. soft parley mutual hold, But rather to engage in combat fierce Incontinent; so shall we soonest learn Whom Jove will make victorious, Him or me. Thus pondering he stood; meantime approach'd Achilles, terrible as fiery Mars, Crest-tossing God, and brandish'd as he came O'er his right shoulder high the Pelian spear. Like lightning, or like flame, or like the sun Ascending, beam'd his armour. At that sight Trembled the Trojan Chief, nor dared expect His nearer step, but flying left the gates Far distant, and Achilles swift pursued. As in the mountains, fleetest fowl of air, The hawk darts eager at the dove; she scuds Aslant, he, screaming, springs and springs again To seize her, all impatient for the prey, So flew Achilles constant to the track Of Hector, who with dreadful haste beneath The Trojan bulwarks plied his agile limbs. Passing the prospect-mount where high in air The wild-fig waved It grew near to the tomb of Ilus., they rush'd along the road, Declining never from the wall of Troy. And now they reach'd the running rivulets clear, Where from Scamander's dizzy flood arise Two fountains, tepid one, from which a smoke Issues voluminous as from a fire, The other, even in summer heats, like hail For cold, or snow, or chrystal-stream frost-bound. Beside them may be seen the broad canals Of marble scoop'd, in which the wives of Troy And all her daughters fair were wont to lave Their costly raiment, while the land had rest, And ere the warlike sons of Greece arrived. By these they ran, one fleeing, one in chase. Valiant was he who fled, but valiant far Beyond him He who urged the swift pursuit; Nor ran they for a vulgar prize, a beast For sacrifice, or for the hide of such, The swift foot-racer's customary meed, But for the noble Hector's life they ran. As when two steeds, oft conquerors, trim the goal For some illustrious prize, a tripod bright Or beauteous virgin, at a funeral game, So they with nimble feet the city thrice Of Priam compass'd. All the Gods look'd on, And thus the Sire of Gods and men began. Ah—I behold a warrior dear to me Around the walls of Ilium driven, and grieve For Hector, who the thighs of fatted bulls On yonder heights of Ida many-valed Burn'd oft to me, and in the heights of Troy: But Him Achilles, glorious Chief, around The city-walls of Priam now pursues. Consider this, ye Gods! weigh the event. Shall we from death save Hector? or, at length, Leave him, although in battle high-renown'd, To perish by the might of Peleus' son? Whom answer'd thus Pallas cœrulean-eyed. Dread Sovereign of the storms! what hast thou said? Wouldst thou deliver from the stroke of fate A mortal man death-destined from of old? Do it; but small thy praise shall be in heaven. Then answer thus, cloud-gatherer Jove return'd. Fear not, Tritonia, daughter dear! that word Spake not my purpose; me thou shalt perceive Always to thee indulgent. What thou wilt That execute, and use thou no delay. So roused he Pallas of herself prepared, And from the heights Olympian down she flew. With unremitting speed Achilles still Urged Hector. As among the mountain-heights The hound pursues, roused newly from her lair The flying fawn through many a vale and grove; And though she trembling skulk the shrubs beneath, Tracks her continual, till he find the prey, So 'scaped not Hector, Peleus' rapid son. Oft as toward the Dardan gates he sprang Direct, and to the bulwarks firm of Troy, Hoping some aid by volleys from the wall, So oft, outstripping him, Achilles thence Enforced him to the field, who, as he might, Still ever stretch'd toward the walls again. As, in a dream The numbers in the original are so constructed as to express the painful struggle that characterizes such a dream., pursuit hesitates oft, This hath no power to fly, that to pursue, So these—One fled, and one pursued in vain. How, then, had Hector his impending fate Eluded, had not Phœbus, at his last, Last effort meeting him, his strength restored, And wing'd for flight his agile limbs anew? The son of Peleus, as he ran, his brows Shaking, forbad the people to dismiss A dart at Hector, lest a meaner hand Piercing him, should usurp the foremost praise. But when the fourth time to those rivulets They came, then lifting high his golden scales, Two lots the everlasting Father placed Within them, for Achilles one, and one For Hector, balancing the doom of both. Grasping it in the midst, he raised the beam. Down went the fatal day of Hector, down To Ades, and Apollo left his side. Then blue-eyed Pallas hasting to the son Of Peleus, in wing'd accents him address'd. Now, dear to Jove, Achilles famed in arms! I hope that, fierce in combat though he be, We shall, at last, slay Hector, and return Crown'd with great glory to the fleet of Greece. No fear of his deliverance now remains, Not even should the King of radiant shafts Apollo toil in supplication, roll'd And roll'd again ??????????????????. before the Thunderer's feet. But stand, recover breath; myself, the while, Shall urge him to oppose thee face to face. So Pallas spake, whom joyful he obey'd, And on his spear brass-pointed lean'd. But she, (Achilles left) to noble Hector pass'd, And in the form, and with the voice loud-toned Approaching of Deiphobus, his ear In accents, as of pity, thus address'd. Ah brother! thou art overtask'd, around The walls of Troy by swift Achilles driven; But stand, that we may chase him in his turn. To whom crest-tossing Hector huge replied. Deiphobus! of all my father's sons Brought forth by Hecuba, I ever loved Thee most, but more than ever love thee now, Who hast not fear'd, seeing me, for my sake To quit the town, where others rest content. To whom the Goddess, thus, cœrulean-eyed. Brother! our parents with much earnest suit Clasping my knees, and all my friends implored me To stay in Troy, (such fear hath seized on all) But grief for thee prey'd on my inmost soul. Come—fight we bravely—spare we now our spears No longer; now for proof if Peleus' son Slaying us both, shall bear into the fleet Our arms gore-stain'd, or perish slain by thee. So saying, the wily Goddess led the way. They soon, approaching each the other, stood Opposite, and huge Hector thus began. Pelides! I will fly thee now no more. Thrice I have compass'd Priam's spacious walls A fugitive, and have not dared abide Thy onset, but my heart now bids me stand Dauntless, and I will slay, or will be slain. But come. We will attest the Gods; for they Are fittest both to witness and to guard Our covenant. If Jove to me vouchsafe The hard-earn'd victory, and to take thy life, I will not with dishonour foul insult Thy body, but, thine armour stripp'd, will give Thee to thy friends, as thou shalt me to mine. To whom Achilles, louring dark, replied. Hector! my bitterest foe! speak not to me Of covenants! as concord can be none Lions and men between, nor wolves and lambs Can be unanimous, but hate perforce Each other by a law not to be changed, So cannot amity subsist between Thee and myself; nor league make I with thee Or compact, till thy blood in battle shed Or mine, shall gratify the fiery Mars. Rouse all thy virtue; thou hast utmost need Of valour now, and of address in arms. Escape me more thou canst not; Pallas' hand By mine subdues thee; now will I avenge At once the agonies of every Greek In thy unsparing fury slain by thee. He said, and, brandishing the Pelian ash, Dismiss'd it; but illustrious Hector warn'd, Couch'd low, and, overflying him, it pierced The soil beyond, whence Pallas plucking it Unseen, restored it to Achilles' hand, And Hector to his godlike foe replied. Godlike Achilles! thou hast err'd, nor know'st At all my doom from Jove, as thou pretend'st, But seek'st, by subtlety and wind of words, All empty sounds, to rob me of my might. Yet stand I firm. Think not to pierce my back. Behold my bosom! if the Gods permit, Meet me advancing, and transpierce me there. Meantime avoid my glittering spear, but oh May'st thou receive it all! since lighter far To Ilium should the toils of battle prove, Wert thou once slain, the fiercest of her foes. He said, and hurling his long spear with aim Unerring, smote the centre of the shield Of Peleus' son, but his spear glanced away. He, angry to have sent it forth in vain, (For he had other none) with eyes downcast Stood motionless awhile, then with loud voice Sought from Deiphobus, white-shielded Chief, A second; but Deiphobus was gone. Then Hector understood his doom, and said. Ah, it is plain; this is mine hour to die. I thought Deiphobus at hand, but me Pallas beguiled, and he is still in Troy. A bitter death threatens me, it is nigh, And there is no escape; Jove, and Jove's son Apollo, from the first, although awhile My prompt deliverers, chose this lot for me, And now it finds me. But I will not fall Inglorious; I will act some great exploit That shall be celebrated ages hence. So saying, his keen faulchion from his side He drew, well-temper'd, ponderous, and rush'd At once to combat. As the eagle darts Right downward through a sullen cloud to seize Weak lamb or timorous hare, so brandishing His splendid faulchion, Hector rush'd to fight. Achilles, opposite, with fellest ire Full-fraught came on; his shield with various art Celestial form'd, o'erspread his ample chest, And on his radiant casque terrific waved The bushy gold of his resplendent crest, By Vulcan spun, and pour'd profuse around. Bright as, among the stars, the star of all Most radiant, Hesperus, at midnight moves, So, in the right-hand of Achilles beam'd His brandish'd spear, while, meditating woe To Hector, he explored his noble form, Seeking where he was vulnerable most. But every part, his dazzling armour torn From brave Patroclus' body, well secured, Save where the circling key-bone from the neck Disjoins the shoulder; there his throat appear'd, Whence injured life with swiftest flight escapes; Achilles, plunging in that part his spear, Impell'd it through the yielding flesh beyond. The ashen beam his power of utterance left Still unimpair'd, but in the dust he fell, And the exulting conqueror exclaim'd. But Hector! thou hadst once far other hopes, And, stripping slain Patroclus, thought'st thee safe, Nor caredst for absent me. Fond dream and vain! I was not distant far; in yonder fleet He left one able to avenge his death, And he hath slain thee. Thee the dogs shall rend Dishonourably, and the fowls of air, But all Achaia's host shall him entomb. To whom the Trojan Chief languid replied. By thy own life, by theirs who gave thee birth, And by thy knees The knees of the conqueror were a kind of sanctuary to which the vanquished fled for refuge., oh let not Greecian dogs Rend and devour me, but in gold accept And brass a ransom at my father's hands, And at my mother's, an illustrious price; Send home my body, grant me burial rites Among the daughters and the sons of Troy. To whom with aspect stern Achilles thus. Dog! neither knees nor parents name to me. I would my fierceness of revenge were such, That I could carve and eat thee, to whose arms Such griefs I owe; so true it is and sure, That none shall save thy carcase from the dogs. No, trust me, would thy parents bring me weigh'd Ten—twenty ransoms, and engage on oath To add still more; would thy Dardanian Sire Priam, redeem thee with thy weight in gold, Not even at that price would I consent That she who bare should place thee on thy bier With lamentation; dogs and ravening fowls Shall rend thy body while a scrap remains. Then, dying, warlike Hector thus replied. Full well I knew before, how suit of mine Should speed preferr'd to thee. Thy heart is steel. But oh, while yet thou livest, think, lest the Gods Requite thee on that day, when pierced thyself By Paris and Apollo, thou shalt fall, Brave as thou art, before the Scæan gate. He ceased, and death involved him dark around. His spirit, from his limbs dismiss'd, the house Of Ades sought, mourning in her descent Youth's prime and vigour lost, disastrous doom! But Him though dead, Achilles thus bespake. Die thou. My death shall find me at what hour Jove gives commandment, and the Gods above. He spake, and from the dead drawing away His brazen spear, placed it apart, then stripp'd His arms gore-stain'd. Meantime the other sons Of the Achaians, gathering fast around, The bulk admired, and the proportion just Of Hector, neither stood a Greecian there Who pierced him not, and thus the soldier spake. Ye Gods! how far more patient of the touch Is Hector now, than when he fired the fleet! Thus would they speak, then give him each a stab. And now, the body stripp'd, their noble Chief The swift Achilles standing in the midst, The Greecians in wing'd accents thus address'd. Friends, Chiefs and Senators of Argos' host! Since, by the will of heaven, this man is slain Who harm'd us more than all our foes beside, Essay we next the city, so to learn The Trojan purpose, whether (Hector slain) They will forsake the citadel, or still Defend it, even though of Him deprived. But wherefore speak I thus? still undeplored, Unburied in my fleet Patroclus lies; Him never, while alive myself, I mix With living men and move, will I forget. In Ades, haply, they forget the dead, Yet will not I Patroclus, even there. Now chaunting pæans, ye Achaian youths! Return we to the fleet with this our prize; We have atchieved great glory The lines of which these three are a translation, are supposed by some to have been designed for the ????????? or song of victory sung by the whole army., we have slain Illustrious Hector, him whom Ilium praised In all her gates, and as a God revered. He said; then purposing dishonour foul To noble Hector, both his feet he bored From heel to ancle, and, inserting thongs, Them tied behind his chariot, but his head Left unsustain'd to trail along the ground. Ascending next, the armour at his side He placed, then lash'd the steeds; they willing flew. Thick dust around the body dragg'd arose, His sable locks all swept the plain, and all His head, so graceful once, now track'd the dust, For Jove had given it into hostile hands That they might shame it in his native soil. Thus, whelm'd in dust, it went. The mother Queen Her son beholding, pluck'd her hair away, Cast far aside her lucid veil, and fill'd With shrieks the air. His father wept aloud, And, all around, long long complaints, were heard And lamentations in the streets of Troy, Not fewer or less piercing, than if flames Had wrapt all Ilium to her topmost towers. His people scarce detain'd the antient King Grief-stung, and resolute to issue forth Through the Dardanian gates; to all he kneel'd In turn, then roll'd himself in dust, and each By name solicited to give him way. Stand off, my fellow mourners! I would pass The gates, would seek, alone, the Greecian fleet. I go to supplicate the bloody man, Yon ravager; he may respect, perchance, My years, may feel some pity of my age; For, such as I am, his own father is, Peleus, who rear'd him for a curse to Troy, But chiefly rear'd him to myself a curse, So numerous have my sons in prime of youth Fall'n by his hand, all whom I less deplore (Though mourning all) than one; my agonies For Hector, soon shall send me to the shades. Oh had he but within these arms expired, The hapless Queen who bore him, and myself Had wept him, then, till sorrow could no more! So spake he weeping, and the citizens All sigh'd around; next, Hecuba began Amid the women, thus, her sad complaint. Ah wherefore, oh my son! wretch that I am, Breathe I forlorn of thee? Thou, night and day, My glory wast in Ilium, thee her sons And daughters, both, hail'd as their guardian God, Conscious of benefits from thee received, Whose life prolong'd should have advanced them all To high renown. Vain boast! thou art no more. So mourn'd the Queen. But fair Andromache Nought yet had heard, nor knew by sure report Hector's delay without the city-gates. She in a closet of her palace sat, A twofold web weaving magnificent, With sprinkled flowers inwrought of various hues, And to her maidens had commandment given Through all her house, that compassing with fire An ample tripod, they should warm a bath For noble Hector from the fight return'd. Tenderness ill-inform'd! she little knew That in the field, from such refreshments far, Pallas had slain him by Achilles' hand. She heard a cry of sorrow from the tower; Her limbs shook under her, her shuttle fell, And to her bright-hair'd train, alarm'd, she cried. Attend me two of you, that I may learn What hath befallen. I have heard the voice Of the Queen-mother; my rebounding heart, Choaks me, and I seem fetter'd by a frost. Some mischief sure o'er Priam's sons impends. Far be such tidings from me! but I fear Horribly, lest Achilles, cutting off My dauntless Hector from the gates alone, Enforce him to the field, and quell perhaps The might, this moment, of that dreadful arm His hinderance long; for Hector ne'er was wont To seek his safety in the ranks, but flew First into battle, yielding place to none. So saying, she rush'd with palpitating heart And frantic air abroad, by her two maids Attended; soon arriving at the tower, And at the throng of men, awhile she stood Down-looking wistful from the city-wall, And, seeing him in front of Ilium, dragg'd So cruelly toward the fleet of Greece, O'erwhelm'd with sudden darkness at the view Fell backward, with a sigh heard all around. Far distant flew dispersed her head-attire, Twist, frontlet, diadem, and even the veil By golden Venus given her on the day When Hector led her from Eëtion's house Enrich'd with nuptial presents to his home. Around her throng'd her sisters of the house Of Priam, numerous, who within their arms Fast held her It is an observation of the Scholiast, that two more affecting spectacles cannot be imagined, than Priam struggling to escape into the field, and Andromache to cast herself from the wall; for so he understands ?????????? ?????????. loathing life; but she, her breath At length and sense recovering, her complaint Broken with sighs amid them thus began. Hector! I am undone; we both were born To misery, thou in Priam's house in Troy, And I in Hypoplacian Thebes wood-crown'd Beneath Eëtion's roof. He, doom'd himself To sorrow, me more sorrowfully doom'd, Sustain'd in helpless infancy, whom oh That he had ne'er begotten! thou descend'st To Pluto's subterraneous dwelling drear, Leaving myself destitute, and thy boy, Fruit of our hapless loves, an infant yet, Never to be hereafter thy delight, Nor love of thine to share or kindness more. For should he safe survive this cruel war, With the Achaians penury and toil Must be his lot, since strangers will remove At will his landmarks, and possess his fields. Thee lost, he loses all, of father, both, And equal playmate in one day deprived, To sad looks doom'd, and never-ceasing tears. He seeks, necessitous his father's friends, One by his mantle pulls, one by his vest, Whose utmost pity yields to his parch'd lips A thirst-provoking drop, and grudges more; Some happier child, as yet untaught to mourn A parent's loss, shoves rudely from the board My son, and, smiting him, reproachful cries— Away—Thy father is no guest of ours— Then, weeping, to his widow'd mother comes Astyanax, who on his father's lap Ate marrow only, once, and fat of lambs, And when sleep took him, and his crying fit Had ceased, slept ever on the softest bed, Warm in his nurse's arms, fed to his fill With delicacies, and his heart at rest. But now, Astyanax (so named in Troy For thy sake, guardian of her gates and towers) His father lost, must many a pang endure. And as for thee, cast naked forth among Yon galleys, where no parent's eye of thine Shall find thee, when the dogs have torn thee once Till they are sated, worms shall eat thee next. Meantime, thy graceful raiment rich, prepared By our own maidens, in thy palace lies; But I will burn it, burn it all, because Useless to thee, who never, so adorn'd, Shalt slumber more; yet every eye in Troy Shall see, how glorious once was thy attire. So, weeping, she; to whom the multitude Of Trojan dames responsive sigh'd around. BOOK XXIII. ARGUMENT OF THE TWENTY-THIRD BOOK. The body of Patroclus is burned, and the funeral games ensue. Such mourning was in Troy; meantime the Greeks Their galleys and the shores of Hellespont Regaining, each to his own ship retired. But not the Myrmidons; Achilles them Close rank'd in martial order still detain'd, And thus his fellow-warriors brave address'd. Ye swift-horsed Myrmidons, associates dear! Release not from your chariots yet your steeds Firm-hoof'd, but, steeds and chariots driving near, Bewail Patroclus, as the rites demand Of burial; then, satiate with grief and tears, We will release our steeds, and take repast. He ended, and, himself leading the way, His numerous band all mourn'd at once the dead. Around the body thrice their glossy steeds, Mourning they drove, while Thetis in their hearts The thirst of sorrow kindled; they with tears The sands bedew'd, with tears their radiant arms, Such deep regret of one so brave they felt. Then, placing on the bosom of his friend His homicidal hands, Achilles thus The shade of his Patroclus, sad, bespake. Hail, oh Patroclus, even in Ades hail! For I will now accomplish to the full My promise pledged to thee, that I would give Hector dragg'd hither to be torn by dogs Piecemeal, and would before thy funeral pile The necks dissever of twelve Trojan youths Of noblest rank, resentful of thy death. He said, and meditating foul disgrace To noble Hector, stretch'd him prone in dust Beside the bier of Menœtiades. Then all the Myrmidons their radiant arms Put off, and their shrill-neighing steeds released. A numerous band beside the bark they sat Of swift Æacides, who furnish'd forth Himself a feast funereal for them all. Many a white ox under the ruthless steel Lay bleeding, many a sheep and blatant goat, With many a saginated boar bright-tusk'd, Amid fierce flames Vulcanian stretch'd to roast. Copious the blood ran all around the dead. And now the Kings of Greece conducted thence To Agamemnon's tent the royal son Of Peleus, loth to go, and won at last With difficulty, such his anger was And deep resentment of his slaughter'd friend. Soon then as Agamemnon's tent they reach'd, The Sovereign bade his heralds kindle fire Around an ample vase, with purpose kind Moving Achilles from his limbs to cleanse The stains of battle; but he firm refused That suit, and bound refusal with an oath— No; by the Highest and the best of all, By Jove I will not. Never may it be That brazen bath approach this head of mine, Till I shall first Patroclus' body give To his last fires, till I shall pile his tomb, And sheer my locks in honour of my friend; For, like to this, no second woe shall e'er My heart invade, while vital breath I draw. But, all unwelcome as it is, repast Now calls us. Agamemnon, King of men! Give thou command that at the dawn they bring Wood hither, such large portion as beseems The dead, descending to the shades, to share, That hungry flames consuming out of sight His body soon, the host may war again. He spake; they, hearing, readily obey'd. Then, each his food preparing with dispatch, They ate, nor wanted any of the guests Due portion, and their appetite sufficed To food and wine, all to their tents repair'd Seeking repose; but on the sands beside The billowy deep Achilles groaning lay Amidst his Myrmidons, where space he found With blood unstain'd beside the dashing wave. There, soon as sleep, deliverer of the mind, Wrapp'd him around (for much his noble limbs With chase of Hector round the battlements Of wind-swept Ilium wearied were and spent) The soul came to him of his hapless friend, In bulk resembling, in expressive eyes And voice Patroclus, and so clad as he. Him, hovering o'er his head, the form address'd. Sleep'st thou, Achilles! of thy friend become Heedless? Him living thou didst not neglect Whom thou neglectest dead. Give me a tomb Instant, that I may pass the infernal gates. For now, the shades and spirits of the dead Drive me afar, denying me my wish To mingle with them on the farthest shore, And in wide-portal'd Ades sole I roam. Give me thine hand, I pray thee, for the earth I visit never more, once burnt with fire; We never shall again close council hold As we were wont, for me my fate severe, Mine even from my birth, hath deep absorb'd. And oh Achilles, semblance of the Gods! Thou too predestined art beneath the wall To perish of the high-born Trojan race. But hear my last injunction! ah, my friend! My bones sepulchre not from thine apart, But as, together we were nourish'd both Beneath thy roof, (what time from Opoëis Menœtius led me to thy father's house, Although a child, yet fugitive for blood, Which, in a quarrel at the dice, I spilt, Killing my playmate by a casual blow, The offspring of Amphidamas, when, like A father, Peleus with all tenderness Received and cherish'd me, and call'd me thine) So, let one vase inclose, at last, our bones, The golden vase, thy Goddess mother's gift. To whom Achilles, matchless in the race. Ah, loved and honour'd! wherefore hast thou come? Why thus enjoin'd me? I will all perform With diligence that thou hast now desired. But nearer stand, that we may mutual clasp Each other, though but with a short embrace, And sad satiety of grief enjoy. He said, and stretch'd his arms toward the shade, But him seized not; shrill-clamouring and light As smoke, the spirit pass'd into the earth. Amazed, upsprang Achilles, clash'd aloud His palms together, and thus, sad, exclaim'd. Ah then, ye Gods! there doubtless are below The soul and semblance both, but empty forms; For all night long, mourning, disconsolate, The soul of my Patroclus, hapless friend! Hath hover'd o'er me, giving me in charge His last requests, just image of himself. So saying, he call'd anew their sorrow forth, And rosy-palm'd Aurora found them all Mourning afresh the pitiable dead. Then royal Agamemnon call'd abroad Mules and mule-drivers from the tents in haste To gather wood. Uprose a valiant man, Friend of the virtuous Chief Idomeneus, Meriones, who led them to the task. They, bearing each in hand his sharpen'd axe And twisted cord, thence journey'd forth, the mules Driving before them; much uneven space They measured, hill and dale, right onward now, And now circuitous; but at the groves Arrived, at length, of Ida fountain-fed, Their keen-edged axes to the towering oaks Dispatchful they applied; down fell the trees With crash sonorous. Splitting, next, the trunks, They bound them on the mules; they, with firm hoofs The hill-side stamping, through the thickets rush'd, Desirous of the plain. Each man his log (For so the armour-bearer of the King Of Crete, Meriones, had them enjoin'd) Bore after them, and each his burthen cast Down on the beach regular, where a tomb Of ample size Achilles for his friend Patroclus had, and for himself, design'd. Much fuel thrown together, side by side There down they sat, and his command at once Achilles issued to his warriors bold, That all should gird their armour, and the steeds Join to their chariots; undelaying each Complied, and in bright arms stood soon array'd. Then mounted combatants and charioteers. First, moved the chariots, next, the infantry Proceeded numerous, amid whom his friends, Bearing the body of Patroclus, went. They poll'd their heads, and cover'd him with hair Shower'd over all his body, while behind Noble Achilles march'd the Hero's head Sustaining sorrowful, for to the realms Of Ades a distinguish'd friend he sent. And now, arriving on the ground erewhile Mark'd by Achilles, setting down the dead, They heap'd the fuel quick, a lofty pile. But Peleus' son, on other thoughts intent, Retiring from the funeral pile, shore off His amber ringlets, whose exuberant growth Sacred to Sperchius he had kept unshorn, And looking o'er the gloomy Deep, he said. Sperchius! in vain Peleus my father vow'd That, hence returning to my native land, These ringlets shorn I should present to thee With a whole hecatomb, and should, beside, Rams offer fifty at thy fountain head In thy own field, at thy own fragrant shrine. So vow'd the hoary Chief, whose wishes thou Leavest unperform'd. Since, therefore, never more I see my native home, the Hero these Patroclus takes down with him to the shades. He said, and filling with his hair the hand Of his dead friend, the sorrows of his train Waken'd afresh. And now the lamp of day Westering Westering wheel. Milton. apace, had left them still in tears, Had not Achilles suddenly address'd King Agamemnon, standing at his side. Atrides! (for Achaia's sons thy word Will readiest execute,) we may with grief Satiate ourselves hereafter; but, the host Dispersing from the pile, now give command That they prepare repast; ourselves Himself and the Myrmidons., to whom These labours in peculiar appertain Will finish them; but bid the Chiefs abide. Which when imperial Agamemnon heard, He scatter'd instant to their several ships The people; but the burial-dressers thence Went not; they, still abiding, heap'd the pile. An hundred feet of breadth from side to side They gave to it, and on the summit placed With sorrowing hearts the body of the dead. Many a fat sheep, with many an ox full-horn'd They flay'd before the pile, busy their task Administering, and Peleus' son the fat Taking from every victim, overspread Complete the body with it of his friend Patroclus, and the flay'd beasts heap'd around. Then, placing flagons on the pile, replete With oil and honey, he inclined their mouths Toward the bier, and slew and added next, Deep-groaning and in haste, four martial steeds. Nine dogs the Hero at his table fed, Of which beheading two, their carcases He added also. Last, twelve gallant sons Of noble Trojans slaying, (for his heart Teem'd with great vengeance,) he applied the force Of hungry flames that should devour the whole, Then, mourning loud, by name his friend invoked. Rejoice, Patroclus! even in the shades. Behold my promise to thee all fulfill'd! Twelve gallant sons of Trojans famed in arms, Together with thyself, are all become Food for these fires: but fire shall never feed On Hector; him I destine to the dogs. So threaten'd he; but Him no dogs devour'd; Them, day and night, Jove's daughter Venus chased Afar, and smooth'd the Hero o'er with oils Of rosy scent ambrosial, lest his corse, Behind Achilles' chariot dragg'd along So rudely, should be torn, and Phœbus hung A veil of sable clouds from heaven to earth, O'ershadowing broad the space where Hector lay, Lest parching suns intense should stiffen him. But the pile kindled not. Then, Peleus' son Seeking a place apart, two Winds in prayer Boreas invoked and Zephyrus, to each Vowing large sacrifice. With earnest suit (Libation pouring from a golden cup) Their coming he implored, that so the flames Kindling, incontinent might burn the dead. Iris, his supplications hearing, swift Convey'd them to the Winds; they, in the hall Banquetting of the heavy-blowing West, Sat frequent. Iris, sudden at the gate Appear'd; they, at the sight upstarting all, Invited each the Goddess to himself. But she refused a seat and thus she spake. I sit not here. Borne over Ocean's stream Again, to Æthiopia's land I go Where hecatombs are offer'd to the Gods, Which, with the rest, I also wish to share. But Peleus' son, earnest, the aid implores Of Boreas and of Zephyrus the loud, Vowing large sacrifice if ye will fan Briskly the pile on which Patroclus lies By all Achaia's warriors deep deplored. She said, and went. Then suddenly arose The Winds, and, roaring, swept the clouds along. First, on the sea they blew; big rose the waves Beneath the blast. At fruitful Troy arrived Vehement on the pile they fell, and dread On all sides soon a crackling blaze ensued. All night, together blowing shrill, they drove The sheeted flames wide from the funeral pile, And all night long, a goblet in his hand From golden beakers fill'd, Achilles stood With large libations soaking deep the soil, And calling on the spirit of his friend. As some fond father mourns, burning the bones Of his own son, who, dying on the eve Of his glad nuptials, hath his parents left O'erwhelm'd with inconsolable distress, So mourn'd Achilles, his companion's bones Burning, and pacing to and fro the field Beside the pile with many a sigh profound. But when the star, day's harbinger, arose, Soon after whom, in saffron vest attired The morn her beams diffuses o'er the sea, The pile, then wasted, ceased to flame, and then Back flew the Winds over the Thracian deep Rolling the flood before them as they pass'd. And now Pelides lying down apart From the funereal pile, slept, but not long, Though weary; waken'd by the stir and din Of Agamemnon's train. He sat erect, And thus the leaders of the host address'd. Atrides, and ye potentates who rule The whole Achaian host! first quench the pile Throughout with generous wine, where'er the fire Hath seized it. We will then the bones collect Of Menœtiades, which shall with ease Be known, though many bones lie scatter'd near, Since in the middle pile Patroclus lay, But wide apart and on its verge we burn'd The steeds and Trojans, a promiscuous heap. Them so collected in a golden vase We will dispose, lined with a double caul, Till I shall, also, to my home below. I wish not now a tomb of amplest bounds But such as may suffice, which yet in height The Greecians and in breadth shall much augment Hereafter, who, survivors of my fate, Shall still remain in the Achaian fleet. So spake Pelides, and the Chiefs complied. Where'er the pile had blazed, with generous wine They quench'd it, and the hills of ashes sank. Then, weeping, to a golden vase, with lard Twice lined, they gave their gentle comrade's bones Fire-bleach'd, and lodging safely in his tent The relics, overspread them with a veil. Designing, next, the compass of the tomb They mark'd its boundary with stones, then fill'd The wide enclosure hastily with earth, And, having heap'd it to its height, return'd. But all the people, by Achilles still Detain'd, there sitting, form'd a spacious ring, And he the destined prizes from his fleet Produced, capacious cauldrons, tripods bright, Steeds, mules, tall oxen, women at the breast Close-cinctured elegant, and unwrought Such it appears to have been in the sequel. iron. First, to the chariot-drivers he proposed A noble prize; a beauteous maiden versed In arts domestic, with a tripod ear'd, Of twenty and two measures. These he made The conqueror's meed. The second should a mare Obtain, unbroken yet, six years her age, Pregnant, and bearing in her womb a mule. A cauldron of four measures, never smirch'd By smoke or flame, but fresh as from the forge The third awaited; to the fourth he gave Two golden talents, and, unsullied yet By use, a twin-ear'd phial ?????—a vessel, as Athenæus describes it, made for the purpose of warming water. It was formed of brass, and expanded somewhat in the shape of a broad leaf. to the fifth. He stood erect, and to the Greeks he cried. Atrides, and ye Chiefs of all the host! These prizes, in the circus placed, attend The charioteers. Held we the present games In honour of some other Greecian dead, I would myself bear hence the foremost prize; For ye are all witnesses well-inform'd Of the superior virtue of my steeds. They are immortal; Neptune on my sire Peleus conferr'd them, and my sire on me. But neither I this contest share myself, Nor shall my steeds; for they would miss the force And guidance of a charioteer so kind As they have lost, who many a time hath cleansed Their manes with water of the crystal brook, And made them sleek, himself, with limpid oil. Him, therefore, mourning, motionless they stand With hair dishevell'd, streaming to the ground. But ye, whoever of the host profess Superior skill, and glory in your steeds And well-built chariots, for the strife prepare! So spake Pelides, and the charioteers, For speed renown'd, arose. Long ere the rest Eumelus, King of men, Admetus' son Arose, accomplish'd in equestrian arts. Next, Tydeus' son, brave Diomede, arose; He yoked the Trojan coursers by himself In battle from Æneas won, what time Apollo saved their master. Third, upstood The son of Atreus with the golden locks, Who to his chariot Agamemnon's mare Swift Æthe and his own Podargus join'd. Her Echepolus from Anchises sprung To Agamemnon gave; she was the price At which he purchased leave to dwell at home Excused attendance on the King at Troy; For, by the gift of Jove, he had acquired Great riches, and in wide-spread Sicyon dwelt. Her wing'd with ardour, Menelaus yoked. Antilochus, arising fourth, his steeds Bright-maned prepared, son of the valiant King Of Pylus, Nestor Neleïades. Of Pylian breed were they, and thus his sire, With kind intent approaching to his side, Advised him, of himself not uninform'd. Antilochus! Thou art, I know, beloved By Jove and Neptune both, from whom, though young, Thou hast received knowledge of every art Equestrian, and hast little need to learn. Thou know'st already how to trim the goal With nicest skill, yet wondrous slow of foot Thy coursers are, whence evil may ensue. But though their steeds be swifter, I account Thee wise, at least, as they. Now is the time For counsel, furnish now thy mind with all Precaution, that the prize escape thee not. The feller of huge trees by skill prevails More than by strength; by skill the pilot guides His flying bark rock'd by tempestuous winds, And more by skill than speed the race is won. But He who in his chariot and his steeds Trusts only, wanders here and wanders there Unsteady, while his coursers loosely rein'd Roam wide the field; not so the charioteer Of sound intelligence; he though he drive Inferior steeds, looks ever to the goal Which close he clips, not ignorant to check His coursers at the first, but with tight rein Ruling his own, and watching those before. Now mark; I will describe so plain the goal That thou shalt know it surely. A dry stump Extant above the ground an ell in height Stands yonder; either oak it is, or pine More likely, which the weather least impairs. Two stones, both white, flank it on either hand. The way is narrow there, but smooth the course On both sides. It is either, as I think, A monument of one long since deceased, Or was, perchance, in ancient days design'd, As now by Peleus' mighty son, a goal. That mark in view, thy steeds and chariot push Near to it as thou may'st; then, in thy seat Inclining gently to the left, prick smart Thy right-hand horse challenging him aloud, And give him rein; but let thy left-hand horse Bear on the goal so closely, that the nave And felly This could not happen unless the felly of the wheel were nearly horizontal to the eye of the spectator, in which case the chariot must be infallibly overturned.—There is an obscurity in the passage which none of the commentators explain. The Scholiast, as quoted by Clarke, attempts an explanation, but, I think, not successfully. of thy wheel may seem to meet. Yet fear to strike the stone, lest foul disgrace Of broken chariot and of crippled steeds Ensue, and thou become the public jest. My boy beloved! use caution; for if once Thou turn the goal at speed, no man thenceforth Shall reach, or if he reach, shall pass thee by, Although Arion in thy rear he drove Adrastus' rapid horse of race divine, Or those, Troy's boast, bred by Laomedon. So Nestor spake, inculcating with care On his son's mind these lessons in the art, And to his place retiring, sat again. Meriones his coursers glossy-maned Made ready last. Then to his chariot-seat Each mounted, and the lots were thrown; himself Achilles shook them. First, forth leap'd the lot Of Nestor's son Antilochus, after whom The King Eumelus took his destined place. The third was Menelaus spear-renown'd; Meriones the fourth; and last of all Bravest of all, heroic Diomede The son of Tydeus took his lot to drive. So ranged they stood; Achilles show'd the goal Far on the champain, nigh to which he placed The godlike Phœnix servant of his sire, To mark the race and make a true report. All raised the lash at once, and with the reins At once all smote their steeds, urging them on Vociferous; they, sudden, left the fleet Far, far behind them, scouring swift the plain. Dark, like a stormy cloud, uprose the dust Their chests beneath, and scatter'd in the wind Their manes all floated; now the chariots swept The low declivity unseen, and now Emerging started into view; erect The drivers stood; emulous, every heart Beat double; each encouraged loud his steeds; They, flying, fill'd with dust the darken'd air. But when returning to the hoary deep They ran their last career, then each display'd Brightest his charioteership, and the race Lay stretch'd, at once, into its utmost speed. Then, soon the mares of Pheretiades Eumelus. Pass'd all, but Diomede behind him came, Borne by his unemasculated steeds Of Trojan pedigree; they not remote, But close pursued him; and at every pace Seem'd entering both, the chariot at their head; For blowing warm into Eumelus' neck Behind, and on his shoulders broad, they went, And their chins rested on him as they flew. Then had Tydides pass'd him, or had made Decision dubious, but Apollo struck, Resentful Resentful of the attack made on him by Diomede in the fifth Book., from his hand the glittering scourge. Fast roll'd the tears indignant down his cheeks, For he beheld the mares with double speed, Flying, and of the spur deprived, his own Retarded steeds continual thrown behind. But not unnoticed by Minerva pass'd The art by Phœbus practised to impede The son of Tydeus, whom with winged haste Following, she gave to him his scourge again, And with new force his lagging steeds inspired. Eumelus, next, the angry Goddess, swift Pursuing, snapt his yoke; wide flew the mares Asunder, and the pole fell to the ground. Himself, roll'd from his seat, fast by the wheel With lacerated elbows, nostrils, mouth, And batter'd brows lay prone; sorrow his eyes Deluged, and disappointment choak'd his voice. Then, far outstripping all, Tydides push'd His steeds beyond, which Pallas fill'd with power That she might make the glorious prize his own. Him follow'd Menelaus amber-hair'd, The son of Atreus, and his father's steeds Encouraging, thus spake Antilochus. Away—now stretch ye forward to the goal. I bid you not to an unequal strife With those of Diomede, for Pallas them Quickens that he may conquer, and the Chief So far advanced makes competition vain. But reach the son of Atreus, fly to reach His steeds, incontinent; ah, be not shamed For ever, foil'd by Æthe, by a mare! Why fall ye thus behind, my noblest steeds? I tell you both, and ye shall prove me true, No favour shall ye find at Nestor's hands, My valiant Sire, but he will thrust his spear Right through you, should we lose, for sloth of yours, Or by your negligence, the nobler prize. Haste then—pursue him—reach the royal Chief— And how to pass him in yon narrow way Shall be my care, and not my care in vain. He ended; they, awhile, awed by his voice, With more exertion ran, and Nestor's son Now saw the hollow streight mark'd by his Sire. It was a chasm abrupt, where winter-floods, Wearing the soil, had gullied deep the way. Thither Atrides, anxious to avoid A clash of chariots drove, and thither drove Also, but somewhat devious from his track, Antilochus. Then Menelaus fear'd, And with loud voice the son of Nestor hail'd. Antilochus, at what a madman's rate Drivest thou! stop—check thy steeds,—the way is here Too streight, but widening soon, will give thee scope To pass me by; beware, lest chariot close To chariot driven, thou maim thyself and me. He said; but still more rapid and the scourge Plying continual, as he had not heard, Antilochus came on. Far as the quoit By some broad-shoulder'd youth for trial hurl'd Of manhood flies, so far Antilochus Shot forward; but the coursers fell behind Of Atreus' son, who now abated much By choice his driving, lest the steeds of both Justling, should overturn with sudden shock Both chariots, and themselves in dust be roll'd, Through hot ambition of the foremost prize. Him then the Hero golden-hair'd reproved. Antilochus! the man lives not on earth Like thee for love of mischief. Go, extoll'd For wisdom falsely by the sons of Greece. Yet, trust me, not without an oath, the prize Thus foully sought shall even now be thine. He said, and to his coursers call'd aloud. Ah be not tardy; stand not sorrow-check'd; Their feet will fail them sooner far than yours, For years have pass'd since they had youth to boast. So He; and springing at his voice, his steeds Regain'd apace the vantage lost. Meantime The Greecians, in full circus seated, mark'd The steeds; they flying, fill'd with dust the air. Then, ere the rest, Idomeneus discern'd The foremost pair; for, on a rising ground Exalted, he without the circus sat, And hearing, though remote, the driver's voice Chiding his steeds, knew it, and knew beside The leader horse distinguish'd by his hue, Chestnut throughout, save that his forehead bore A splendid blazon white, round as the moon. He stood erect, and to the Greeks he cried. Friends! Chiefs and senators of Argos' host! Discern I sole the steeds, or also ye? The horses, foremost now, to me appear Other than erst, and I descry at hand A different charioteer; the mares of late Victorious, somewhere distant in the race Are hurt; I plainly saw them at the first Turning the goal, but see them now no more; And yet with eyes inquisitive I range From side to side the whole broad plain of Troy. Either the charioteer hath slipp'd the reins, Or rounded not successfully the goal Through want of guidance. Thrown, as it should seem, Forth from his seat, he hath his chariot maim'd, And his ungovern'd steeds have roam'd away. Arise and look ye forth yourselves, for I With doubtful ken behold him; yet the man Seems, in my view, Ætolian by descent, A Chief of prime renown in Argos' host, The Hero Tydeus' son, brave Diomede. But Ajax Oïliades the swift Him sharp reproved. Why art thou always given To prate, Idomeneus? thou seest the mares, Remote indeed, but posting to the goal. Thou art not youngest of the Argives here So much, nor from beneath thy brows look forth Quick-sighted more than ours, thine eyes abroad, Yet still thou pratest, although silence more Should suit thee, among wiser far than thou. The mares which led, lead still, and he who drives Eumelus is, the same who drove before. To whom the Cretan Chief, angry, replied. Ajax! whom none in wrangling can excel Or rudeness, though in all beside thou fall Below the Argives, being boorish-rough, Come now—a tripod let us wager each, Or cauldron, and let Agamemnon judge Whose horses lead, that, losing, thou may'st learn. He said; then sudden from his seat upsprang Swift Ajax Oïliades, prepared For harsh retort, nor had the contest ceased Between them, but had grown from ill to worse, Had not himself, Achilles, interposed. Ajax—Idomeneus—abstain ye both From bitter speech offensive, and such terms As ill become you. Ye would feel, yourselves, Resentment, should another act as ye. Survey the course, peaceable, from your seats; The charioteers, by competition wing'd, Will soon themselves arrive, then shall ye know Distinctly, both who follows and who leads. He scarce had said, when nigh at hand appear'd Tydides, lashing, as he came, his steeds Continual; they with hoofs uplifted high Their yet remaining ground shorten'd apace, Sprinkling with dusty drops at every stroke Their charioteer, while close upon their heels Radiant with tin and gold the chariot ran, Scarce tracking light the dust, so swift they flew. He stood in the mid-circus; there the sweat Rain'd under them from neck and chest profuse, And Diomede from his resplendent seat Leaping, reclined his scourge against the yoke. Nor was his friend brave Sthenelus remiss, But, seizing with alacrity the prize, Consign'd the tripod and the virgin, first, To his own band in charge; then, loosed the steeds. Next came, by stratagem, not speed advanced To that distinction, Nestor's son, whom yet The Hero Menelaus close pursued. Near as the wheel runs to a courser's heels, Drawing his master at full speed; his tail With its extremest hairs the felly sweeps That close attends him o'er the spacious plain, So near had Menelaus now approach'd Antilochus; for though at first he fell A full quoit's cast behind, he soon retrieved That loss, with such increasing speed the mare Bright-maned of Agamemnon, Æthe, ran; She, had the course few paces more to both Afforded, should have clearly shot beyond Antilochus, nor dubious left the prize. But noble Menelaus threw behind Meriones, companion in the field, Of King Idomeneus, a lance's flight, For slowest were his steeds, and he, to rule The chariot in the race, least skill'd of all. Last came Eumelus drawing to the goal, Himself, his splendid chariot, and his mares Driving before him. Peleus' rapid son Beheld him with compassion, and, amid The Argives, in wing'd accents thus he spake. Here comes the most expert, driving his steeds Before him. Just it were that he received The second prize; Tydides claims the first. He said, and all applauded the award. Then had Achilles to Eumelus given The mare (for such the pleasure seem'd of all) Had not the son of mighty Nestor risen, Antilochus, who pleaded thus his right. Achilles! acting as thou hast proposed, Thou shalt offend me much, for thou shalt take The prize from me, because the Gods, his steeds And chariot-yoke disabling, render'd vain His efforts, and no failure of his own. It was his duty to have sought the Gods In prayer, then had he not, following on foot His coursers, hindmost of us all arrived. But if thou pity him, and deem it good, Thou hast much gold, much brass, and many sheep In thy pavilion; thou hast maidens fair, And coursers also. Of thy proper stores Hereafter give to him a richer prize Than this, or give it now, so shall the Greeks Applaud thee; but this mare yield I to none; Stand forth the Greecian who desires to win That recompense, and let him fight with me. He ended, and Achilles, godlike Chief, Smiled on him, gratulating his success, Whom much he loved; then, ardent, thus replied. Antilochus! if thou wouldst wish me give Eumelus of my own, even so I will. I will present to him my corslet bright Won from Asteropæus, edged around With glittering tin; a precious gift, and rare. So saying, he bade Automedon his friend Produce it from the tent; he at his word Departing, to Achilles brought the spoil, Which at his hands Eumelus glad received. Then, stung with grief, and with resentment fired Immeasurable, Menelaus rose To charge Antilochus. His herald gave The sceptre to his hand, and (silence bidden To all) the godlike Hero thus began. Antilochus! oh heretofore discreet! What hast thou done? Thou hast dishonour'd foul My skill, and wrong'd my coursers, throwing thine, Although inferior far, by fraud before them. Ye Chiefs and Senators of Argos' host! Impartial judge between us, lest, of these, Some say hereafter, Menelaus bore Antilochus by falsehood down, and led The mare away, because, although his steeds Were worse, his arm was mightier, and prevail'd. Yet hold—myself will judge, and will to all Contentment give, for I will judge aright. Hither, Antilochus, illustrious youth! And, as the law prescribes, standing before Thy steeds and chariot, holding too the scourge With which thou drovest, lay hand on both thy steeds, And swear by Neptune, circler of the earth, That neither wilfully, nor yet by fraud Thou didst impede my chariot in its course. Then, prudent, thus Antilochus replied. Oh royal Menelaus! patient bear The fault of one thy junior far, in years Alike unequal and in worth to thee. Thou know'st how rash is youth, and how propense To pass the bounds by decency prescribed, Quick, but not wise. Lay, then, thy wrath aside; The mare now given me I will myself Deliver to thee, and if thou require A larger recompense, will rather yield A larger much than from thy favour fall Deservedly for ever, mighty Prince! And sin so heinously against the Gods. So saying, the son of valiant Nestor led The mare, himself, to Menelaus' hand, Who with heart-freshening joy the prize received. As on the ears of growing corn the dews Fall grateful, while the spiry grain erect Bristles the fields, so, Menelaus, felt Thy inmost soul a soothing pleasure sweet! Then answer thus the Hero quick return'd. Antilochus! exasperate though I were, Now, such no longer, I relinquish glad All strife with thee, for that at other times Thou never inconsiderate wast or light, Although by youthful heat misled to-day. Yet safer is it not to over-reach Superiors, for no other Greecian here Had my extreme displeasure calm'd so soon; But thou hast suffer'd much, and much hast toil'd, As thy good father and thy brother have, On my behalf; I, therefore, yield, subdued By thy entreaties, and the mare, though mine, Will also give thee, that these Greecians all May know me neither proud nor hard to appease. So saying, the mare he to Noëmon gave, Friend of Antilochus, and, well-content, The polish'd cauldron for his prize received. The fourth awarded lot (for he had fourth Arrived) Meriones asserted next, The golden talents; but the phial still Left unappropriated Achilles bore Across the circus in his hand, a gift To ancient Nestor, whom he thus bespake. Thou also, oh my father! this accept, Which, in remembrance of the funeral rites Of my Patroclus, keep, for him thou seest Among the Greeks no more. Receive a prize, Thine by gratuity; for thou shalt wield The cæstus, wrestle, at the spear contend, Or in the foot-race (fallen as thou art Into the wane of life) never again. He said, and placed it in his hands. He, glad, Receiving it, in accents wing'd replied. True, oh my son! is all which thou hast spoken. These limbs, these hands, young friend! (their vigour lost) No longer, darted from the shoulder, spring At once to battle. Ah that I could grow Young yet again, could feel again such force Athletic, as when in Buprasium erst The Epeans with sepulchral pomp entomb'd King Amarynceus, where his sons ordain'd Funereal games in honour of their Sire! Epean none or even Pylian there Could cope with me, or yet Ætolian bold. Boxing, I vanquish'd Clytomedes, son Of Enops; wrestling, the Pleuronian Chief Ancæus; in the foot-race Iphiclus, Though a fleet runner; and I over-pitch'd Phyleus and Polydorus at the spear. The sons of Actor in the chariot-race Alone surpass'd me, being two for one, And jealous both lest I should also win That prize, for to the victor charioteer They had assign'd the noblest prize of all. They were twin-brothers, and one ruled the steeds, The steeds one ruled The repetition follows the Original., the other lash'd them on. Such once was I; but now, these sports I leave To younger; me submission most befits To withering age, who then outshone the best. But go. The funeral of thy friend with games Proceed to celebrate; I accept thy gift With pleasure; and my heart is also glad That thou art mindful evermore of one Who loves thee, and such honour in the sight Yield'st me of all the Greeks, as is my due. May the Gods bless thee for it more and more! He spake, and Peleus' son, when he had heard At large his commendation from the lips Of Nestor, through the assembled Greeks return'd. He next proposed, not lightly to be won, The boxer's prize. He tether'd down a mule, Untamed and hard to tame, but strong to toil, And in her prime of vigour, in the midst; A goblet to the vanquish'd he assign'd, Then stood erect, and to the Greeks exclaim'd. Atridæ! and ye Argives brazen-greaved! I call for two bold combatants expert To wage fierce strife for these, with lifted fists Smiting each other. He, who by the aid Of Phœbus shall o'ercome, and whom the Greeks Shall all pronounce victorious, leads the mule Hence to his tent; the vanquish'd takes the cup. He spake, and at his word a Greek arose Big, bold, and skilful in the boxer's art, Epeüs, son of Panopeus; his hand He on the mule imposed, and thus he said. Approach the man ambitious of the cup! For no Achaian here shall with his fist Me foiling, win the mule. I boast myself To all superior. May it not suffice That I to no pre-eminence pretend In battle? To attain to foremost praise Alike in every art is not for one. But this I promise, and will well perform— My blows shall lay him open, split him, crush His bones to splinters, and let all his friends, Attendant on him, wait to bear him hence, Vanquish'd by my superior force in fight. He ended, and his speech found no reply. One godlike Chief alone, Euryalus, Son of the King Mecisteus, who, himself, Sprang from Talaion, opposite arose. He, on the death of Oedipus, at Thebes Contending in the games held at his tomb, Had overcome the whole Cadmean race. Him Diomede spear-famed for fight prepared, Giving him all encouragement, for much He wish'd him victory. First then he threw ???????????. His cincture to him; next, he gave him thongs With which they bound on the cæstus. Cut from the hide of a wild buffalo. Both girt around, into the midst they moved. Then, lifting high their brawny arms, and fists Mingling with fists, to furious fight they fell; Dire was the crash of jaws, and the sweat stream'd From every limb. Epeüs fierce advanced, And while Euryalus with cautious eye Watch'd his advantage, pash'd him on the cheek. He stood no longer, but, his shapely limbs, Unequal to his weight, sinking, he fell. As by the rising North-wind driven ashore An huge fish flounces on the weedy beach, Which soon the sable flood covers again, So, beaten down, he bounded. But Epeüs, Heroic Chief, upraised him by his hand, And his own comrades from the circus forth Led him, step dragging after step, the blood Ejecting grumous, and at every pace Rolling his head languid from side to side. They placed him all unconscious on his seat In his own band, then fetch'd his prize, the cup. Still other prizes, then, Achilles placed In view of all, the sturdy wrestler's meed. A large hearth-tripod, valued by the Greeks At twice six beeves, should pay the victor's toil; But for the vanquish'd, in the midst he set A damsel in variety expert Of arts domestic, valued at four beeves. He rose erect, and to the Greeks he cried. Arise ye, now, who shall this prize dispute. So spake the son of Peleus; then arose Huge Telamonian Ajax, and upstood Ulysses also, in all wiles adept. Both girt around, into the midst they moved. With vigorous gripe each lock'd the other fast, Like rafters, standing, of some mansion built By a prime artist, proof against all winds. Their backs, tugg'd vehemently, creak'd ????????.—It is a circumstance on which the Scholiast observes that it denotes in a wrestler the greatest possible bodily strength and firmness of position. —See Villoisson., the sweat Trickled, and on their flanks and shoulders, red The whelks arose; they bearing still in mind The tripod, ceased not struggling for the prize. Nor could Ulysses from his station move And cast down Ajax, nor could Ajax him Unsettle, fixt so firm Ulysses stood. But when, long time expectant, all the Greeks Grew weary, then, huge Ajax him bespake. Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd! Lift, or be lifted, and let Jove decide. He said, and heaved Ulysses. Then, his wiles Forgat not He, but on the ham behind Chopp'd him; the limbs of Ajax at the stroke Disabled sank; he fell supine, and bore Ulysses close adhering to his chest Down with him. Wonder rivetted all eyes. Then brave Ulysses from the ground awhile Him lifted in his turn, but ere he stood, Inserting his own knee the knees between I have given what seems to me the most probable interpretation, and such a one as to any person who has ever witnessed a wrestling-match, will, I presume, appear intelligible. Of Ajax, threw him. To the earth they fell Both, and with dust defiled lay side by side. And now, arising to a third essay, They should have wrestled yet again, had not Achilles, interfering, them restrain'd. Strive not together more; cease to exhaust Each other's force; ye both have earn'd the prize. Depart alike requited, and give place To other Greecians who shall next contend. He spake; they glad complied, and wiping off The dust, put on their tunics. Then again Achilles other prizes yet proposed, The rapid runner's meed. First, he produced A silver goblet of six measures; earth Own'd not its like for elegance of form. Skilful Sidonian artists had around Embellish'd it, and o'er the sable Deep Phœnician merchants into Lemnos' port Had borne it, and the boon to Thoas King of Lemnos. given; But Jason's son, Euneüs, in exchange For Priam's son Lycaon, to the hand Had pass'd it of Patroclus famed in arms. Achilles this, in honour of his friend, Set forth, the swiftest runner's recompense. The second should a fatted ox receive Of largest size, and he assign'd of gold A just half-talent to the worst and last. He stood erect, and to the Greeks he cried. Now stand ye forth who shall this prize dispute. He said, and at his word instant arose Swift Ajax Oïliades; upsprang The shrewd Ulysses next, and after him Brave Nestor's son Antilochus, with whom None vied in speed of all the youths of Greece. They stood prepared. Achilles show'd the goal. At once all started. Oïliades Led swift the course, and closely at his heels Ulysses ran. Near as some cinctured maid Industrious holds the distaff to her breast, While to and fro with practised finger neat She tends the flax drawing it to a thread, So near Ulysses follow'd him, and press'd His footsteps, ere the dust fill'd them again, Pouring his breath into his neck behind, And never slackening pace. His ardent thirst Of victory with universal shouts All seconded, and, eager, bade him On. And now, the contest shortening to a close, Ulysses his request silent and brief To azure-eyed Minerva thus preferr'd. Oh Goddess hear, prosper me in the race! Such was his prayer, with which Minerva pleased, Freshen'd his limbs, and made him light to run. And now, when in one moment they should both Have darted on the prize, then Ajax' foot Sliding, he fell; for where the dung of beeves Slain by Achilles for his friend, had spread The soil, there That is to say, Ulysses; who from the first intending it, had run close behind him. Pallas tripp'd him. Ordure foul His mouth, and ordure foul his nostrils fill'd. Then brave Ulysses, first arriving, seized The cup, and Ajax took his prize, the ox. He grasp'd his horn, and sputtering as he stood The ordure forth, the Argives thus bespake. Ah—Pallas tripp'd my footsteps; she attends Ulysses ever with a mother's care. Loud laugh'd the Greecians. Then, the remnant prize Antilochus receiving, smiled and said. Ye need not, fellow-warriors, to be taught That now, as ever, the immortal Gods Honour on seniority bestow. Ajax is elder, yet not much, than I. But Laertiades was born in times Long past, a Chief coeval with our Sires, Not young, but vigorous; and, of the Greeks, Achilles may alone with Him contend. So saying, the merit of superior speed To Peleus' son he gave, who thus replied. Antilochus! thy praise of me shall prove Nor vain nor unproductive to thyself, For the half-talent doubled shall be thine. He spake, and, doubling it, the talent placed Whole in his hand. He glad the gift received. Achilles, then, Sarpedon's arms produced, Stripp'd from him by Patroclus, his long spear, Helmet and shield, which in the midst he placed. He stood erect, and to the Greeks he cried. I call for two brave warriors arm'd, to prove Each other's skill with weapons keen, this prize Disputing, next, in presence of us all. Who first shall through his armour reach the skin Of his antagonist, and shall draw his blood, To Him this silver-studded faulchion bright I give; the blade is Thracian, and of late Asteropæus wore it, whom I slew. These other arms shall be their common meed, And I will banquet both within my tent. He said, then Telamonian Ajax huge Arose, and opposite the son arose Of warlike Tydeus, Diomede the brave. Apart from all the people each put on His arms, then moved into the middle space, Louring terrific, and on fire to fight. The host look'd on amazed. Approaching each The other, thrice they sprang to the assault, And thrice struck hand to hand. Ajax the shield Pierced of his adversary, but the flesh Attain'd not, baffled by his mail within. Then Tydeus' son, sheer o'er the ample disk Of Ajax, thrust a lance home to his neck, And the Achaians for the life appall'd Of Ajax, bade them, ceasing, share the prize. But the huge faulchion with its sheath and belt— Achilles them on Diomede bestow'd. The Hero, next, an iron clod produced Rough from the forge, and wont to task the might Of King Eëtion; but, when him he slew, Pelides, glorious Chief, with other spoils From Thebes convey'd it in his fleet to Troy. He stood erect, and to the Greeks he cried. Come forth who also shall this prize dispute! How far soe'er remote the winner's fields, This lump shall serve his wants five circling years; His shepherd shall not, or his plower, need In quest of iron seek the distant town, But hence he shall himself their wants supply. Then Polypœtes brave in fight arose, Arose Leonteus also, godlike Chief, With Ajax son of Telamon. Each took His station, and Epeüs seized the clod. He swung, he cast it, and the Greecians laugh'd. Leonteus, branch of Mars, quoited it next. Huge Telamonian Ajax with strong arm Dismiss'd it third, and overpitch'd them both. But when brave Polypœtes seized the mass Far as the vigorous herdsmen flings his staff That twirling flies his numerous beeves between, So far his cast outmeasured all beside, And the host shouted. Then the friends arose Of Polypœtes valiant Chief, and bore His ponderous acquisition to the ships. The archers' prize Achilles next proposed, Ten double and ten single axes, form'd Of steel convertible to arrow-points. He fix'd, far distant on the sands, the mast Of a brave bark cœrulean-prow'd, to which With small cord fasten'd by the foot he tied A timorous dove, their mark at which to aim. The transition from narrative to dramatic follows the Original.Who strikes the dove, he conquers, and shall bear These double axes all into his tent. But who the cord alone, missing the bird, Successful less, he wins the single blades. The might of royal Teucer then arose, And, fellow-warrior of the King of Crete, Valiant Meriones. A brazen casque Received the lots; they shook them, and the lot Fell first to Teucer. He, at once, a shaft Sent smartly forth, but vow'd not to the King Apollo; frequently by Homer called the King without any addition. An hecatomb, all firstlings of the flock. He therefore (for Apollo greater praise Denied him) miss'd the dove, but struck the cord That tied her, at small distance from the knot, And with his arrow sever'd it. Upsprang The bird into the air, and to the ground Depending fell the cord. Shouts rent the skies. Then, all in haste, Meriones the bow Caught from his hand holding a shaft the while Already aim'd, and to Apollo vow'd An hecatomb, all firstlings of the flock. He eyed the dove aloft, under a cloud, And, while she wheel'd around, struck her beneath The pinion; through her and beyond her pass'd The arrow, and, returning, pierced the soil Fast by the foot of brave Meriones. She, perching on the mast again, her head Reclined, and hung her wide-unfolded wing, But, soon expiring, dropp'd and fell remote. Amazement seized the people. To his tent Meriones the ten best axes bore, And Teucer the inferior ten to his. Then, last, Achilles in the circus placed A ponderous spear and cauldron yet unfired, Emboss'd with flowers around, its worth an ox. Upstood the spear-expert; Atrides first, Wide-ruling Agamemnon, King of men, And next, brave fellow-warrior of the King Of Crete, Meriones; when thus his speech Achilles to the royal Chief address'd. Atrides! (for we know thy skill and force Matchless! that none can hurl the spear as thou) This prize is thine, order it to thy ship; And if it please thee, as I would it might, Let brave Meriones the spear receive. He said; nor Agamemnon not complied, But to Meriones the brazen spear Presenting, to Talthybius gave in charge The cauldron, next, his own illustrious prize. BOOK XXIV. ARGUMENT OF THE TWENTY-FOURTH BOOK. Priam, by command of Jupiter, and under conduct of Mercury, seeks Achilles in his tent, who admonished previously by Thetis, consents to accept ransom for the body of Hector. Hector is mourned, and the manner of his funeral, circumstantially described, concludes the poem. The games all closed, the people went dispersed Each to his ship; they, mindful of repast, And to enjoy repose; but other thoughts Achilles' mind employ'd; he still deplored With tears his loved Patroclus, nor the force Felt of all-conquering sleep, but turn'd and turn'd Restless from side to side, mourning the loss Of such a friend, so manly, and so brave. Their fellowship in toil; their hardships oft Sustain'd in fight laborious, or o'ercome With difficulty on the perilous Deep— Remembrance busily retracing themes Like these, drew down his cheeks continual tears. Now on his side he lay, now lay supine, Now prone; then starting from his couch he roam'd Forlorn the beach, nor did the rising morn On seas and shores escape his watchful eye, But joining to his chariot his swift steeds, He fasten'd Hector to be dragg'd behind. Around the tomb of Menœtiades Him thrice he dragg'd; then rested in his tent, Leaving him at his length stretch'd in the dust. Meantime Apollo with compassion touch'd Even of the lifeless Hector, from all taint Saved him, and with the golden ægis broad Covering, preserved him, although dragg'd, untorn. While he, indulging thus his wrath, disgraced Brave Hector, the Immortals, at that sight With pity moved, exhorted Mercury The watchful Argicide, to steal him thence. That counsel pleased the rest, but neither pleased Juno, nor Neptune, nor the blue-eyed maid. They still, as at the first, held fast their hate Of sacred Troy, detested Priam still, And still his people, mindful of the crime Of Paris, who when to his rural hut They came, those Goddesses affronting, praise And admiration gave to Her alone Who with vile lusts his preference repaid. But when the twelfth ensuing morn arose, Apollo, then, the Immortals thus address'd. Ye Gods, your dealings now injurious seem And cruel. Was not Hector wont to burn Thighs of fat goats and bullocks at your shrines? Whom now, though dead, ye cannot yet endure To rescue, that Andromache once more Might view him, his own mother, his own son, His father and the people, who would soon Yield him his just demand, a funeral fire. But, oh ye Gods! your pleasure is alone To please Achilles, that pernicious Chief, Who neither right regards, nor owns a mind That can relent, but as the lion, urged By his own dauntless heart and savage force, Invades without remorse the rights of man, That he may banquet on his herds and flocks, So Peleus' son all pity from his breast Hath driven, and shame, man's blessing His blessing, if he is properly influenced by it; his curse in its consequences if he is deaf to its dictates. or his curse His blessing, if he is properly influenced by it; his curse in its consequences if he is deaf to its dictates.. For whosoever hath a loss sustain'd Still dearer, whether of his brother born From the same womb, or even of his son, When he hath once bewail'd him, weeps no more, For fate itself gives man a patient mind. Yet Peleus' son, not so contented, slays Illustrious Hector first, then drags his corse In cruel triumph at his chariot-wheels Around Patroclus' tomb; but neither well He acts, nor honourably to himself, Who may, perchance, brave though he be, incur Our anger, while to gratify revenge He pours dishonour thus on senseless clay. To whom, incensed, Juno white-arm'd replied. And be it so; stand fast this word of thine, God of the Silver bow! if ye account Only such honour to Achilles due As Hector claims; but Hector was by birth Mere man, and suckled at a woman's breast. Not such Achilles; him a Goddess bore, Whom I myself nourish'd, and on my lap Fondled, and in due time to Peleus gave In marriage, to a Chief beloved in heaven Peculiarly; ye were yourselves, ye Gods! Partakers of the nuptial feast, and thou Wast present also with thine harp in hand, Thou comrade of the vile! thou faithless ever! Then answer thus cloud-gatherer Jove return'd. Juno, forbear. Indulge not always wrath Against the Gods. They shall not share alike, And in the same proportion our regards. Yet even Hector was the man in Troy Most favour'd by the Gods, and him no less I also loved, for punctual were his gifts To us; mine altar never miss'd from him Libation, or the steam of sacrifice, The meed allotted to us from of old. But steal him not, since by Achilles' eye Unseen ye cannot, who both day and night Watches This is the sense preferred by the Scholiast, for it is not true that Thetis was always present with Achilles, as is proved by the passage immediately ensuing. him, as a mother tends her son. But call ye Thetis hither, I would give The Goddess counsel, that, at Priam's hands Accepting gifts, Achilles loose the dead. He ceased. Then Iris tempest-wing'd arose. Samos between, and Imbrus rock-begirt, She plunged into the gloomy flood; loud groan'd The briny pool, while sudden down she rush'd, As sinks the bull's The angler's custom was, in those days, to guard his line above the hook from the fishes' bite, by passing it through a pipe of horn. horn with its leaden weight, Death bearing to the raveners of the Deep. Within her vaulted cave Thetis she found By every nymph of Ocean round about Encompass'd; she, amid them all, the fate Wept of her noble son ordain'd to death At fertile Troy, from Phthia far remote. Then, Iris, drawing near, her thus address'd. Arise, O Thetis! Jove, the author dread Of everlasting counsels, calls for thee. To whom the Goddess of the Silver feet. Why calls the mighty Thunderer me? I fear, Oppress'd with countless sorrows as I am, To mingle with the Gods.—Yet I obey— No word of his can prove an empty sound. So saying, the Goddess took her sable veil, (Eye ne'er beheld a darker,) and began Her progress, by the storm-wing'd Iris led. On either hand the billows open'd wide A pass before them; they, ascending soon The shore, updarted swift into the skies. They found loud-voiced Saturnian Jove around Environ'd by the ever blessed Gods Convened in full assembly; she beside Her Father Jove (Pallas retiring) sat. Then, Juno, with consolatory speech, Presented to her hand a golden cup, Of which she drank, then gave it back again, And thus the Sire of Gods and men began. Goddess of ocean, Thetis! thou hast sought Olympus, bearing in thy bosom grief Never to be assuaged, as well I know. Yet shalt thou learn, afflicted as thou art, Why I have summon'd thee. Nine days the Gods, Concerning Hector's body and thy own Brave city-spoiler son, have held dispute, And some have urged ofttimes the Argicide Keen-sighted Mercury, to steal the dead. But I forbad it for Achilles' sake, Whom I exalt, the better to insure Thy reverence and thy friendship evermore. Haste, therefore, seek thy son, and tell him thus. The Gods resent it, say (but most of all Myself am angry) that he still detains Amid his fleet, through fury of revenge, Unransom'd Hector; so shall he, at length, Through fear of me, perchance, release the slain. Myself to generous Priam will, the while, Send Iris, who shall bid him to the fleet Of Greece, such ransom bearing as may soothe Achilles, for redemption of his son. So spake the God, nor Thetis not complied. Descending swift from the Olympian heights She reach'd Achilles' tent. Him there she found Groaning disconsolate, while others ran To and fro, occupied around a sheep New-slaughter'd, large, and of exuberant fleece. She, sitting close beside him, softly stroak'd His cheek, and thus, affectionate, began. How long, my son! sorrowing and mourning here, Wilt thou consume thy soul, nor give one thought Either to food or love? Yet love is good, And woman grief's best cure; for length of days Is not thy doom, but, even now, thy death And ruthless destiny are on the wing. Mark me,—I come a lieger sent from Jove. The Gods, he saith, resent it, but himself More deeply than the rest, that thou detain'st Amid thy fleet, through fury of revenge, Unransom'd Hector. Be advised, accept Ransom, and to his friends resign the dead. To whom Achilles, swiftest of the swift. Come then the ransomer, and take him hence; If Jove himself command it,—Be it so. So they, among the ships, conferring sat On various themes, the Goddess and her son; Meantime Saturnian Jove commanded down His swift embassadress to sacred Troy. Hence, rapid Iris! leave the Olympian heights, And, finding noble Priam, bid him haste Into Achaia's fleet, bearing such gifts As may assuage Achilles, and prevail To liberate the body of his son. Alone, he must; no Trojan of them all May company the senior thither, save An ancient herald to direct his mules And his wheel'd litter, and to bring the dead Back into Ilium, whom Achilles slew. Let neither fear of death nor other fear Trouble him aught, so safe a guard and sure We give him; Mercury shall be his guide Into Achilles' presence in his tent. Nor will himself Achilles slay him there, Or even permit his death, but will forbid All violence; for he is not unwise Nor heedless, no—nor wilful to offend, But will his suppliant with much grace receive Jupiter justifies him against Apollo's charge, affirming him to be free from those mental defects which chiefly betray men into sin, folly, improvidence, and perverseness.. He ceased; then Iris tempest-wing'd arose, Jove's messenger, and, at the gates arrived Of Priam, woe and wailing found within. Around their father, in the hall, his sons Their robes with tears water'd, while them amidst The hoary King sat mantled, muffled close, And on his venerable head and neck Much dust was spread, which, rolling on the earth, He had shower'd on them with unsparing hands. The palace echoed to his daughters' cries, And to the cries of matrons calling fresh Into remembrance many a valiant Chief Now stretch'd in dust, by Argive hands destroy'd. The messenger of Jove at Priam's side Standing, with whisper'd accents low his ear Saluted, but he trembled at the sound. Courage, Dardanian Priam! fear thou nought; To thee no prophetess of ill, I come; But with kind purpose: Jove's ambassadress Am I, who though remote, yet entertains Much pity, and much tender care for thee. Olympian Jove commands thee to redeem The noble Hector, with an offering large Of gifts that may Achilles' wrath appease. Alone, thou must; no Trojan of them all Hath leave to attend thy journey thither, save An ancient herald to direct thy mules And thy wheel'd litter, and to bring the dead Back into Ilium, whom Achilles slew. Let neither fear of death nor other fear Trouble thee aught, so safe a guard and sure He gives thee; Mercury shall be thy guide Even to Achilles' presence in his tent. Nor will himself Achilles slay thee there, Or even permit thy death, but will forbid All violence; for he is not unwise Nor heedless, no—nor wilful to offend, But will his suppliant with much grace receive. So spake the swift ambassadress, and went. Then, calling to his sons, he bade them bring His litter forth, and bind the coffer on, While to his fragrant chamber he repair'd Himself, with cedar lined and lofty-roof'd, A treasury of wonders, into which The Queen he summon'd, whom he thus bespake. Hecuba! the ambassadress of Jove Hath come, who bids me to the Greecian fleet, Bearing such presents thither as may sooth Achilles, for redemption of my son. But say, what seems this enterprize to thee? Myself am much inclined to it, I feel My courage prompting me amain toward The fleet, and into the Achaian camp. Then wept the Queen aloud, and thus replied. Ah! whither is thy wisdom fled, for which Both strangers once, and Trojans honour'd thee? How canst thou wish to penetrate alone The Greecian fleet, and to appear before His face, by whom so many valiant sons Of thine have fallen? Thou hast an iron heart! For should that savage man and faithless once Seize and discover thee, no pity expect Or reverence at his hands. Come—let us weep Together, here sequester'd; for the thread Spun for him by his destiny severe When he was born, ordain'd our son remote From us his parents to be food for hounds In that Chief's tent. Oh! clinging to his side, How I could tear him with my teeth! His deeds, Disgraceful to my son, then should not want Retaliation; for he slew not him Skulking, but standing boldly for the wives, The daughters fair, and citizens of Troy, Guiltless of flight But, at first, he did fly. It is therefore spoken, as the Scholiast observes, ???????????, and must be understood as the language of strong maternal affection., and of the wish to fly. Whom Godlike Priam answer'd, ancient King. Impede me not who willing am to go, Nor be, thyself, a bird of ominous note To terrify me under my own roof, For thou shalt not prevail. Had mortal man Enjoin'd me this attempt, prophet, or priest, Or soothsayer, I had pronounced him false And fear'd it but the more. But, since I saw The Goddess with these eyes, and heard, myself, The voice divine, I go; that word shall stand; And, if my doom be in the fleet of Greece To perish, be it so; Achilles' arm Shall give me speedy death, and I shall die Folding my son, and satisfied with tears. So saying, he open'd wide the elegant lids Of numerous chests, whence mantles twelve he took Of texture beautiful; twelve single cloaks; As many carpets, with as many robes, To which he added vests, an equal store. He also took ten talents forth of gold, All weigh'd, two splendid tripods, cauldrons four, And after these a cup of matchless worth Given to him when ambassador in Thrace; A noble gift, which yet the hoary King Spared not, such fervour of desire he felt To loose his son. Then from his portico, With angry taunts he drove the gather'd crowds. Away! away! ye dregs of earth, away! Ye shame of human kind! Have ye no griefs At home, that ye come hither troubling me? Deem ye it little that Saturnian Jove Afflicts me thus, and of my very best, Best boy deprives me? Ah! ye shall be taught Yourselves that loss, far easier to be slain By the Achaians now, since he is dead. But I, ere yet the city I behold Taken and pillaged, with these aged eyes, Shall find safe hiding in the shades below. He said, and chased them with his staff; they left In haste the doors, by the old King expell'd. Then, chiding them aloud, his sons he call'd, Helenus, Paris, noble Agathon, Pammon, Antiphonus, and bold in fight Polites, Dios of illustrious fame, Hippothoüs and Deiphobus—all nine He call'd, thus issuing, angry, his commands, Quick! quick! ye slothful in your father's cause, Ye worthless brood! would that in Hector's stead Ye all had perish'd in the fleet of Greece! Oh altogether wretched! in all Troy No man had sons to boast valiant as mine, And I have lost them all. Mestor is gone The godlike, Troilus the steed-renown'd, And Hector, who with other men compared Seem'd a Divinity, whom none had deem'd From mortal man derived, but from a God. These Mars hath taken, and hath left me none But scandals of my house, void of all truth, Dancers, exact step-measurers ????????????? ???????., a band Of public robbers, thieves of kids and lambs. Will ye not bring my litter to the gate This moment, and with all this package quick Charge it, that we may hence without delay? He said, and by his chiding awed, his sons Drew forth the royal litter, neat, new-built, And following swift the draught, on which they bound The coffer; next, they lower'd from the wall The sculptured boxen yoke with its two rings Through which the reins were passed.; And with the yoke its furniture, in length Nine cubits; this to the extremest end Adjusting of the pole, they cast the ring Over the ring-bolt; then, thrice through the yoke They drew the brace on both sides, made it fast With even knots, and tuck'd The yoke being flat at bottom, and the pole round, there would of course be a small aperture between the band and the pole on both sides, through which, according to the Scholium in Villoisson, they thrust the ends of the tackle lest they should dangle. the dangling ends. Producing, next, the glorious ransom-price Of Hector's body, on the litter's floor They heap'd it all, then yoked the sturdy mules, A gift illustrious by the Mysians erst Conferr'd on Priam; to the chariot, last, They led forth Priam's steeds, which the old King (In person serving them) with freshest corn Constant supplied; meantime, himself within The palace, and his herald, were employ'd Girding The text here is extremely intricate; as it stands now, the sons are, first, said to yoke the horses, then Priam and Idæus are said to do it, and in the palace too. I have therefore adopted an alteration suggested by Clarke, who with very little violence to the copy, proposes instead of ?????????? to read—?????????. themselves, to go; wise each and good. And now came mournful Hecuba, with wine Delicious charged, which in a golden cup She brought, that not without libation due First made, they might depart. Before the steeds Her steps she stay'd, and Priam thus address'd. Take this, and to the Sire of all perform Libation, praying him a safe return From hostile hands, since thou art urged to seek The Greecian camp, though not by my desire. Pray also to Idæan Jove cloud-girt, Who oversees all Ilium, that he send His messenger or ere thou go, the bird His favourite most, surpassing all in strength, At thy right-hand; him seeing, thou shalt tend With better hope toward the fleet of Greece. But should loud-thundering Jove his lieger swift Withhold, from me far be it to advise This journey, howsoe'er thou wish to go. To whom the godlike Priam thus replied. This exhortation will I not refuse, O Queen! for, lifting to the Gods his hands In prayer for their compassion, none can err. So saying, he bade the maiden o'er the rest, Chief in authority, pour on his hands Pure water, for the maiden at his side With ewer charged and laver, stood prepared. He laved his hands; then, taking from the Queen The goblet, in his middle area stood Pouring libation with his eyes upturn'd Heaven-ward devout, and thus his prayer preferr'd. Jove, great and glorious above all, who rulest, On Ida's summit seated, all below! Grant me arrived within Achilles' tent Kindness to meet and pity, and oh send Thy messenger or ere I go, the bird Thy favourite most, surpassing all in strength, At my right hand, which seeing, I shall tend With better hope toward the fleet of Greece. He ended, at whose prayer, incontinent, Jove sent his eagle, surest of all signs, The black-plumed bird voracious, Morphnos The words both signify—sable. named, And Percnos The words both signify—sable.. Wide as the well-guarded door Of some rich potentate his vans he spread On either side; they saw him on the right, Skimming the towers of Troy; glad they beheld That omen, and all felt their hearts consoled. Delay'd not then the hoary King, but quick Ascending to his seat, his coursers urged Through vestibule and sounding porch abroad. The four-wheel'd litter led, drawn by the mules Which sage Idæus managed, behind whom Went Priam, plying with the scourge his steeds Continual through the town, while all his friends, Following their sovereign with dejected hearts, Lamented him as going to his death. But when from Ilium's gate into the plain They had descended, then the sons-in-law Of Priam, and his sons, to Troy return'd. Nor they, now traversing the plain, the note Escaped of Jove the Thunderer; he beheld Compassionate the venerable King, And thus his own son Mercury bespake. Mercury! (for above all others thou Delightest to associate with mankind Familiar, whom thou wilt winning with ease To converse free,) go thou, and so conduct Priam into the Greecian camp, that none Of all the numerous Danaï may see Or mark him, till he reach Achilles' tent. He spake, nor the embassador of heaven The Argicide delay'd, but bound in haste His undecaying sandals to his feet, Golden, divine, which waft him o'er the floods Swift as the wind, and o'er the boundless earth. He took his rod with which he charms to sleep All eyes, and theirs who sleep opens again. Arm'd with that rod, forth flew the Argicide. At Ilium and the Hellespontic shores Arriving sudden, a King's son he seem'd, Now cloathing first his ruddy cheek with down, Which is youth's loveliest season; so disguised, His progress he began. They now (the tomb Magnificent of Ilus past) beside The river stay'd the mules and steeds to drink, For twilight dimm'd the fields. Idæus first Perceived him near, and Priam thus bespake. Think, son of Dardanus! for we have need Of our best thought. I see a warrior. Now, Now we shall die; I know it. Turn we quick Our steeds to flight; or let us clasp his knees And his compassion suppliant essay. Terrour and consternation at that sound The mind of Priam felt; erect the hair Bristled his limbs, and with amaze he stood Motionless. But the God, meantime, approach'd, And, seizing ancient Priam's hand, enquired. Whither, my father! in the dewy night Drivest thou thy mules and steeds, while others sleep? And fear'st thou not the fiery host of Greece, Thy foes implacable, so nigh at hand? Of whom should any, through the shadow dun Of flitting night, discern thee bearing forth So rich a charge, then what wouldst thou expect? Thou art not young thyself, nor with the aid Of this thine ancient servant, strong enough Force to repulse, should any threaten force. But injury fear none or harm from me; I rather much from harm by other hands Would save thee, thou resemblest so my sire. Whom answer'd godlike Priam, hoar with age. My son! well spoken. Thou hast judged aright. Yet even me some Deity protects Thus far; to whom I owe it that I meet So seasonably one like thee, in form So admirable, and in mind discrete As thou art beautiful. Blest parents, thine! To whom the messenger of heaven again, The Argicide. Oh ancient and revered! Thou hast well spoken all. Yet this declare, And with sincerity; bear'st thou away Into some foreign country, for the sake Of safer custody, this precious charge? Or, urged by fear, forsake ye all alike Troy's sacred towers? since he whom thou hast lost, Thy noble son, was of excelling worth In arms, and nought inferior to the Greeks. Then thus the godlike Priam, hoary King. But tell me first, who Thou art, and from whom Descended, loveliest youth! who hast the fate So well of my unhappy son rehearsed? To whom the herald Mercury replied. Thy questions, venerable Sire! proposed Concerning noble Hector, are design'd To prove me. Him, not seldom, with these eyes In man-ennobling fight I have beheld Most active; saw him when he thinn'd the Greeks With his sharp spear, and drove them to the ships. Amazed we stood to notice him; for us, Incensed against the ruler of our host, Achilles suffer'd not to share the fight. I serve Achilles; the same gallant bark Brought us, and of the Myrmidons am I, Son of Polyctor; wealthy is my Sire, And such in years as thou; six sons he hath, Beside myself the seventh, and, (the lots cast Among us all,) mine sent me to the wars. That I have left the ships, seeking the plain, The cause is this; the Greeks, at break of day, Will compass, arm'd, the city, for they loath To sit inactive, neither can the Chiefs Restrain the hot impatience of the host. Then godlike Priam answer thus return'd. If of the band thou be of Peleus' son, Achilles, tell me undisguised the truth. My son, subsists he still, or hath thy Chief Limb after limb given him to his dogs? Him answer'd then the herald of the skies. Oh venerable Sir! him neither dogs Have eaten yet, nor fowls, but at the ships His body, and within Achilles' tent Neglected lies. Twelve days he so hath lain; Yet neither worm which diets on the brave In battle fallen, hath eaten him, or taint Invaded. He around Patroclus' tomb Drags him indeed pitiless, oft as day Reddens the East, yet safe from blemish still His corse remains. Thou would'st, thyself, admire, Seeing how fresh the dew-drops, as he lies, Rest on him, and his blood is cleansed away That not a stain is left. Even his wounds (For many a wound they gave him) all are closed, Such care the blessed Gods have of thy son, Dead as he is, whom living much they loved. So he; then, glad, the ancient King replied. Good is it, oh my son! to yield the Gods Their just demands. My boy, while yet he lived, Lived not unmindful of the worship due To the Olympian powers, who, therefore, him Remember, even in the bands of death. Come then—this beauteous cup take at my hand— Be thou my guard, and, if the Gods permit, My guide, till to Achilles' tent I come. Whom answer'd then the messenger of heaven. Sir! thou perceivest me young, and art disposed To try my virtue; but it shall not fail. Thou bidd'st me at thine hand a gift accept, Whereof Achilles knows not; but I fear Achilles, and on no account should dare Defraud him, lest some evil find me next. But Thee I would with pleasure hence conduct Even to glorious Argos, over sea Or over land, nor any, through contempt Of such a guard, should dare to do thee wrong. So Mercury, and to the chariot seat Upspringing, seized at once the lash and reins, And with fresh vigour mules and steeds inspired. Arriving at the foss and towers, they found The guard preparing now their evening cheer, All whom the Argicide with sudden sleep Oppress'd, then oped the gates, thrust back the bars, And introduced, with all his litter-load Of costly gifts, the venerable King. But when they reach'd the tent for Peleus' son Raised by the Myrmidons (with trunks of pine They built it, lopping smooth the boughs away, Then spread with shaggy mowings of the mead Its lofty roof, and with a spacious court Surrounded it, all fenced with driven stakes; One bar alone of pine secured the door, Which ask'd three Greecians with united force To thrust it to its place, and three again To thrust it back, although Achilles oft Would heave it to the door himself alone;) Then Hermes, benefactor of mankind, That bar displacing for the King of Troy, Gave entrance to himself and to his gifts For Peleus' son design'd, and from the seat Alighting, thus his speech to Priam turn'd. Oh ancient Priam! an immortal God Attends thee; I am Hermes, by command Of Jove my father thy appointed guide. But I return. I will not, entering here, Stand in Achilles' sight; immortal Powers May not so unreservedly indulge Creatures of mortal kind. But enter thou, Embrace his knees, and by his father both And by his Goddess mother sue to him, And by his son, that his whole heart may melt. So Hermes spake, and to the skies again Ascended. Then leap'd Priam to the ground, Leaving Idæus; he, the mules and steeds Watch'd, while the ancient King into the tent Proceeded of Achilles dear to Jove. Him there he found, and sitting found apart His fellow-warriors, of whom two alone Served at his side, Alcimus, branch of Mars, And brave Automedon; he had himself Supp'd newly, and the board stood unremoved. Unseen of all huge Priam enter'd, stood Near to Achilles, clasp'd his knees, and kiss'd Those terrible and homicidal hands That had destroy'd so many of his sons. As when a fugitive for blood the house Of some Chief enters in a foreign land, All gaze, astonish'd at the sudden guest, So gazed Achilles seeing Priam there, And so stood all astonish'd, each his eyes In silence fastening on his fellow's face. But Priam kneel'd, and suppliant thus began. Think, oh Achilles, semblance of the Gods! On thy own father full of days like me, And trembling on the gloomy verge of life. Some neighbour Chief, it may be, even now Oppresses him, and there is none at hand, No friend to succour him in his distress. Yet, doubtless, hearing that Achilles lives, He still rejoices, hoping, day by day, That one day he shall see the face again Of his own son from distant Troy return'd. But me no comfort cheers, whose bravest sons, So late the flower of Ilium, all are slain. When Greece came hither, I had fifty sons; Nineteen were children of one bed, the rest Born of my concubines. A numerous house! But fiery Mars hath thinn'd it. One I had, One, more than all my sons the strength of Troy, Whom standing for his country thou hast slain— Hector—His body to redeem I come Into Achaia's fleet, bringing, myself, Ransom inestimable to thy tent. Reverence the Gods, Achilles! recollect Thy father; for his sake compassion show To me more pitiable still, who draw Home to my lips (humiliation yet Unseen on earth) his hand who slew my son. So saying, he waken'd in his soul regret Of his own Sire; softly he placed his hand On Priam's hand, and push'd him gently away. Remembrance melted both. Rolling before Achilles' feet, Priam his son deplored Wide-slaughtering Hector, and Achilles wept By turns his father, and by turns his friend Patroclus; sounds of sorrow fill'd the tent. But when, at length satiate, Achilles felt His heart from grief, and all his frame relieved, Upstarting from his seat, with pity moved Of Priam's silver locks and silver beard, He raised the ancient father by his hand, Whom in wing'd accents kind he thus bespake. Wretched indeed! ah what must thou have felt! How hast thou dared to seek alone the fleet Of the Achaians, and his face by whom So many of thy valiant sons have fallen? Thou hast an heart of iron, terrour-proof. Come—sit beside me—Let us, if we may, Great mourners both, bid sorrow sleep awhile. There is no profit of our sighs and tears; For thus, exempt from care themselves, the Gods Ordain man's miserable race to mourn. Fast by the threshold of Jove's courts are placed Two casks, one stored with evil, one with good, From which the God dispenses as he wills. For whom the glorious Thunderer mingles both, He leads a life checquer'd with good and ill Alternate; but to whom he gives unmixt The bitter cup, he makes that man a curse, His name becomes a by-word of reproach, His strength is hunger-bitten, and he walks The blessed earth, unblest, go where he may. So was my father Peleus at his birth Nobly endow'd with plenty and with wealth Distinguish'd by the Gods past all mankind, Lord of the Myrmidons, and, though a man, Yet match'd from heaven with an immortal bride. But even him the Gods afflict, a son Refusing him, who might possess his throne Hereafter; for myself, his only heir, Pass as a dream, and while I live, instead Of solacing his age, here sit, before Your distant walls, the scourge of thee and thine. Thee also, ancient Priam, we have heard Reported, once possessor of such wealth As neither Lesbos, seat of Macar, owns, Nor Eastern Phrygia, nor yet all the ports Of Hellespont, but thou didst pass them all In riches, and in number of thy sons. But since the Powers of Heaven brought on thy land This fatal war, battle and deeds of death Always surround the city where thou reign'st. Cease, therefore, from unprofitable tears, Which, ere they raise thy son to life again, Shall, doubtless, find fresh cause for which to flow. To whom the ancient King godlike replied. Hero, forbear. No seat is here for me, While Hector lies unburied in your camp. Loose him, and loose him now, that with these eyes I may behold my son; accept a price Magnificent, which may'st thou long enjoy, And, since my life was precious in thy sight, May'st thou revisit safe thy native shore! To whom Achilles, louring, and in wrath Mortified to see his generosity, after so much kindness shown to Priam, still distrusted, and that the impatience of the old king threatened to deprive him of all opportunity to do gracefully what he could not be expected to do willingly.. Urge me no longer, at a time like this, With that harsh note; I am already inclined To loose him. Thetis, my own mother came Herself on that same errand, sent from Jove. Priam! I understand thee well. I know That, by some God conducted, thou hast reach'd Achaia's fleet; for, without aid divine, No mortal even in his prime of youth, Had dared the attempt; guards vigilant as ours He should not easily elude, such gates, So massy, should not easily unbar. Thou, therefore, vex me not in my distress, Lest I abhor to see thee in my tent, And, borne beyond all limits, set at nought Thee, and thy prayer, and the command of Jove. He said; the old King trembled, and obey'd. Then sprang Pelides like a lion forth, Not sole, but with his two attendant friends Alcimus and Automedon the brave, For them (Patroclus slain) he honour'd most Of all the Myrmidons. They from the yoke Released both steeds and mules, then introduced And placed the herald of the hoary King. They lighten'd next the litter of its charge Inestimable, leaving yet behind Two mantles and a vest, that, not unveil'd, The body might be borne back into Troy. Then, calling forth his women, them he bade Lave and anoint the body, but apart, Lest haply Priam, noticing his son, Through stress of grief should give resentment scope, And irritate by some affront himself To slay him, in despight of Jove's commands. They, therefore, laving and anointing first The body, cover'd it with cloak and vest; Then, Peleus' son disposed it on the bier, Lifting it from the ground, and his two friends Together heaved it to the Royal wain. Achilles, last, groaning, his friend invoked. Patroclus! should the tidings reach thine ear, Although in Ades, that I have released The noble Hector at his father's suit, Resent it not; no sordid gifts have paid His ransom-price, which thou shalt also share. So saying, Achilles to his tent return'd, And on the splendid couch whence he had risen Again reclined, opposite to the seat Of Priam, whom the Hero thus bespake. Priam! at thy request thy son is loosed, And lying on his bier; at dawn of day Thou shalt both see him and convey him hence Thyself to Troy. But take we now repast; For even bright-hair'd Niobe her food Forgat not, though of children twelve bereft, Of daughters six, and of six blooming sons. Apollo these struck from his silver bow, And those shaft-arm'd Diana, both incensed That oft Latona's children and her own Numbering, she scorn'd the Goddess who had borne Two only, while herself had twelve to boast. Vain boast! those two sufficed to slay them all. Nine days they welter'd in their blood, no man Was found to bury them, for Jove had changed To stone the people; but themselves, at last, The Powers of Heaven entomb'd them on the tenth. Yet even she, once satisfied with tears, Remember'd food; and now, the rocks among And pathless solitudes of Sipylus, The rumour'd cradle of the nymphs who dance On Acheloüs' banks, although to stone Transform'd, she broods her heaven-inflicted woes. Come, then, my venerable guest! take we Refreshment also; once arrived in Troy With thy dear son, thou shalt have time to weep Sufficient, nor without most weighty cause. So spake Achilles, and, upstarting, slew A sheep white-fleeced, which his attendants flay'd, And busily and with much skill their task Administring, first scored the viands well, Then pierced them with the spits, and when the roast Was finish'd, drew them from the spits again. And now, Automedon dispensed around The polish'd board bread in neat baskets piled, Which done, Achilles portion'd out to each His share, and all assail'd the ready feast. But when nor hunger more nor thirst they felt, Dardanian Priam, wond'ring at his bulk And beauty, (for he seem'd some God from heaven) Gazed on Achilles, while Achilles held Not less in admiration of his looks Benign, and of his gentle converse wise, Gazed on Dardaniam Priam, and, at length, (The eyes of each gratified to the full) The ancient King thus to Achilles spake. Hero! dismiss us now each to our bed, That there at ease reclined, we may enjoy Sweet sleep; for never have these eyelids closed Since Hector fell and died, but without cease I mourn, and nourishing unnumber'd woes, Have roll'd me in the ashes of my courts. But I have now both tasted food, and given Wine to my lips, untasted till with thee. So he, and at his word Achilles bade His train beneath his portico prepare With all dispatch two couches, purple rugs, And Arras, and warm mantles over all. Forth went the women bearing lights, and spread A couch for each, when feigning needful fear ????????????. Clarke renders the word in this place, falso metú ludens, and Eustathius says that Achilles suggested such cause of fear to Priam, to excuse his lodging him in an exterior part of the tent. The general import of the Greek word is sarcastic, but here it signifies rather—to intimidate. See also Dacier., Achilles thus his speech to Priam turn'd. My aged guest beloved! sleep thou without; Lest some Achaian Chief (for such are wont Oftimes, here sitting, to consult with me) Hither repair; of whom should any chance To spie thee through the gloom, he would at once Convey the tale to Agamemnon's ear, Whence hindrance might arise, and the release Haply of Hector's body be delay'd. But answer me with truth. How many days Would'st thou assign to the funereal rites Of noble Hector, for so long I mean Myself to rest, and keep the host at home? Then thus the ancient King godlike replied. If thou indeed be willing that we give Burial to noble Hector, by an act So generous, O Achilles! me thou shalt Much gratify; for we are shut, thou know'st, In Ilium close, and fuel must procure From Ida's side remote; fear, too, hath seized On all our people. Therefore thus I say. Nine days we wish to mourn him in the house; To his interment we would give the tenth, And to the public banquet; the eleventh Shall see us build his tomb; and on the twelfth (If war we must) we will to war again. To whom Achilles, matchless in the race. So be it, ancient Priam! I will curb Twelve days the rage of war, at thy desire. He spake, and at his wrist the right hand grasp'd Of the old Sovereign, to dispel his fear. Then in the vestibule the herald slept And Priam, prudent both, but Peleus' son In the interior tent, and at his side Brisëis, with transcendent beauty adorn'd. Now all, all night, by gentle sleep subdued, Both Gods and chariot-ruling warriors lay, But not the benefactor of mankind, Hermes; him sleep seized not, but deep he mused How likeliest from amid the Greecian fleet He might deliver by the guard unseen The King of Ilium; at his head he stood In vision, and the senior thus bespake. Ah heedless and secure! hast thou no dread Of mischief, ancient King, that thus by foes Thou sleep'st surrounded, lull'd by the consent And sufferance of Achilles? Thou hast given Much for redemption of thy darling son, But thrice that sum thy sons who still survive Must give to Agamemnon and the Greeks For thy redemption, should they know thee here. He ended; at the sound alarm'd upsprang The King, and roused his herald. Hermes yoked Himself both mules and steeds, and through the camp Drove them incontinent, by all unseen. Soon as the windings of the stream they reach'd, Deep-eddied Xanthus, progeny of Jove, Mercury the Olympian summit sought, And saffron-vested morn o'erspread the earth. They, loud lamenting, to the city drove Their steeds; the mules close follow'd with the dead. Nor warrior yet, nor cinctured matron knew Of all in Ilium aught of their approach, Cassandra sole except. She, beautiful As golden Venus, mounted on the height Of Pergamus, her father first discern'd, Borne on his chariot-seat erect, and knew The herald heard so oft in echoing Troy; Him also on his bier outstretch'd she mark'd, Whom the mules drew. Then, shrieking, through the streets She ran of Troy, and loud proclaim'd the sight. Ye sons of Ilium and ye daughters, haste, Haste all to look on Hector, if ye e'er With joy beheld him, while he yet survived, From fight returning; for all Ilium erst In him, and all her citizens rejoiced. She spake. Then neither male nor female more In Troy remain'd, such sorrow seized on all. Issuing from the city-gate, they met Priam conducting, sad, the body home, And, foremost of them all, the mother flew And wife of Hector to the bier, on which Their torn-off tresses with unsparing hands They shower'd, while all the people wept around. All day, and to the going down of day They thus had mourn'd the dead before the gates, Had not their Sovereign from his chariot-seat Thus spoken to the multitude around. Fall back on either side, and let the mules Pass on; the body in my palace once Deposited, ye then may weep your fill. He said; they, opening, gave the litter way. Arrived within the royal house, they stretch'd The breathless Hector on a sumptuous bed, And singers placed beside him, who should chaunt The strain funereal; they with many a groan The dirge began, and still, at every close, The female train with many a groan replied. Then, in the midst, Andromache white-arm'd Between her palms the dreadful Hector's head Pressing, her lamentation thus began. My Hero! thou hast fallen in prime of life, Me leaving here desolate, and the fruit Of our ill-fated loves, an helpless child, Whom grown to manhood I despair to see. For ere that day arrive, down from her height Precipitated shall this city fall, Since thou hast perish'd once her sure defence, Faithful protector of her spotless wives, And all their little ones. Those wives shall soon In Greecian barks capacious hence be borne, And I among the rest. But thee, my child! Either thy fate shall with thy mother send Captive into a land where thou shalt serve In sordid drudgery some cruel lord, Or haply some Achaian here, thy hand Seizing, shall hurl thee from a turret-top To a sad death, avenging brother, son, Or father by the hands of Hector slain; For He made many a Greecian bite the ground. Thy father, boy, bore never into fight A milky mind, and for that self-same cause Is now bewail'd in every house of Troy. Sorrow unutterable thou hast caused Thy parents, Hector! but to me hast left Largest bequest of misery, to whom, Dying, thou neither didst thy arms extend Forth from thy bed, nor gavest me precious word To be remember'd day and night with tears. So spake she weeping, whom her maidens all With sighs accompanied, and her complaint Mingled with sobs Hecuba next began. Ah Hector! dearest to thy mother's heart Of all her sons, much must the Gods have loved Thee living, whom, though dead, they thus preserve. What son soever of our house beside Achilles took, over the barren Deep To Samos, Imbrus, or to Lemnos girt With rocks inhospitable, him he sold; But thee, by his dread spear of life deprived, He dragg'd and dragg'd around Patroclus' tomb, As if to raise again his friend to life Whom thou hadst vanquish'd; yet he raised him not. But as for thee, thou liest here with dew Besprinkled, fresh as a young plant This, according to the Scholiast, is a probable sense of ?????????.—He derives it ??? ??? ?????? ?????????? ?? ??? ?????. —See Villoisson., and more Resemblest some fair youth by gentle shafts Of Phœbus pierced, than one in battle slain. So spake the Queen, exciting in all hearts Sorrow immeasurable, after whom Thus Helen, third, her lamentation pour'd. Ah, dearer far than all my brothers else Of Priam's house! for being Paris' spouse, Who brought me (would I had first died!) to Troy, I call thy brothers mine; since forth I came From Sparta, it is now the twentieth year, Yet never heard I once hard speech from thee, Or taunt morose, but if it ever chanced, That of thy father's house female or male Blamed me, and even if herself the Queen, (For in the King, whate'er befell, I found Always a father,) thou hast interposed Thy gentle temper and thy gentle speech To soothe them; therefore, with the same sad drops Thy fate, oh Hector! and my own I weep; For other friend within the ample bounds Of Ilium have I none, nor hope to hear Kind word again, with horror view'd by all. So Helen spake weeping, to whom with groans The countless multitude replied, and thus Their ancient Sovereign next his people charged. Ye Trojans, now bring fuel home, nor fear Close ambush of the Greeks; Achilles' self Gave me, at my dismission from his fleet, Assurance, that from hostile force secure We shall remain, till the twelfth dawn arise. All, then, their mules and oxen to the wains Join'd speedily, and under Ilium's walls Assembled numerous; nine whole days they toil'd, Bringing much fuel home, and when the tenth Bright morn, with light for human kind, arose, Then bearing noble Hector forth, with tears Shed copious, on the summit of the pile They placed him, and the fuel fired beneath. But when Aurora, daughter of the Dawn, Redden'd the East, then, thronging forth, all Troy Encompass'd noble Hector's pile around. The whole vast multitude convened, with wine They quench'd the pile throughout, leaving no part Unvisited, on which the fire had seized. His brothers, next, collected, and his friends, His white bones, mourning, and with tears profuse Watering their cheeks; then in a golden urn They placed them, which with mantles soft they veil'd Mæonian-hued, and, delving, buried it, And overspread with stones the spot adust. Lastly, short time allowing to the task, They heap'd his tomb, while, posted on all sides, Suspicious of assault, spies watch'd the Greeks. The tomb once heap'd, assembling all again Within the palace, they a banquet shared Magnificent, by godlike Priam given. Such burial the illustrious Hector found. ?? ???? ???????? ????? ??????? ??????????. I cannot take my leave of this noble poem, without expressing how much I am struck with this plain conclusion of it. It is like the exit of a great man out of company whom he has entertained magnificently; neither pompous nor familiar; not contemptuous, yet without much ceremony. I recollect nothing, among the works of mere man, that exemplifies so strongly the true style of great antiquity.</field>

TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE COUNTESS DOWAGER SPENCER, THE FOLLOWING TRANSLATION OF THE ODYSSEY, A POEM THAT EXHIBITS IN THE CHARACTER OF ITS HEROINE AN EXAMPLE OF ALL DOMESTIC VIRTUE, IS WITH EQUAL PROPRIETY AND RESPECT INSCRIBED BY HER LADYSHIP'S MOST DEVOTED SERVANT, THE AUTHOR. BOOK I. ARGUMENT OF THE FIRST BOOK. In a council of the Gods, Minerva calls their attention to Ulysses, still a wanderer. They resolve to grant him a safe return to Ithaca. Minerva descends to encourage Telemachus, and in the form of Mentes directs him in what manner to proceed. Throughout this book the extravagance and profligacy of the suitors are occasionally suggested. Muse, make the man thy theme, for shrewdness famed And genius versatile, who far and wide A Wanderer, after Ilium overthrown, Discovered various cities, and the mind And manners learn'd of men in lands remote. He numerous woes, on Ocean toss'd, endured, Anxious to save himself, and to conduct His followers to their home; yet all his care Preserved them not; they perish'd self-destroy'd By their own fault; infatuate! who devour'd The oxen of the all-o'erseeing Sun, And, punish'd for that crime, return'd no more. Daughter divine of Jove, these things record, As it may please thee, even in our ears. The rest, all those who had perdition 'scaped By war or on the Deep, dwelt now at home; Him only, of his country and his wife Alike desirous, in her hollow grots Calypso, Goddess beautiful, detain'd Wooing him to her arms. But when, at length, (Many a long year elapsed,) the year arrived Of his return (by the decree of Heaven) To Ithaca, not even then had he, Although surrounded by his people, reach'd The period of his sufferings and his toils. Yet all the Gods, with pity moved, beheld His woes, save Neptune; He alone with wrath Unceasing and implacable pursued Godlike Ulysses to his native shores. But Neptune, now, the Æthiopians sought, (The Æthiopians, utmost of mankind, These Eastward situate, those toward the West,) Call'd to an hecatomb of bulls and lambs. There sitting, pleased he banquetted; the Gods In Jove's abode, meantime, assembled all, 'Midst whom the Sire of heaven and earth began. For he recalled to mind Ægisthus slain By Agamemnon's celebrated son Orestes, and retracing in his thought That dread event, the Immortals thus address'd. Alas! how prone are human-kind to blame The Powers of Heaven! From us, they say, proceed The ills which they endure, yet more than Fate Herself inflicts, by their own crimes incur. So now Ægisthus, by no force constrain'd Of Destiny, Atrides' wedded wife Took to himself, and him at his return Slew, not unwarn'd of his own dreadful end By us; for we commanded Hermes down The watchful Argicide, who bade him fear Alike, to slay the King, or woo the Queen: For that Atrides' son Orestes, soon As grown mature, and eager to assume His sway imperial, should avenge the deed. So Hermes spake, but his advice moved not Ægisthus, on whose head the whole arrear Of vengeance heap'd, at last, hath therefore fallen. Whom answer'd then Pallas cœrulean-eyed. Oh Jove, Saturnian Sire, o'er all supreme! And well he merited the death he found; So perish all who shall, like him, offend. But with a bosom anguish-rent I view Ulysses, hapless Chief, who from his friends Remote, affliction hath long time endured In yonder wood-land isle, the central boss Of Ocean. That retreat a Goddess holds, Daughter of sapient Atlas, who the abyss Knows to its bottom, and the pillars high Himself upbears which separate earth from heaven. His daughter, there, the sorrowing Chief detains, And ever with smooth speech insidious seeks To wean his heart from Ithaca; meantime Ulysses, happy might he but behold The smoke ascending from his native land, Death covets. Canst thou not, Olympian Jove! At last relent? Hath not Ulysses oft With victims slain amid Achaia's fleet Thee gratified while yet at Troy he fought? How hath he then so deep incensed thee, Jove? To whom the cloud-assembler God replied. What word hath pass'd thy lips, Daughter beloved? Can I forget Ulysses? Him forget So noble, who in wisdom all mankind Excels, and who hath sacrificed so oft To us whose dwelling is the boundless heaven? Earth-circling Neptune—He it is whose wrath Pursues him ceaseless for the Cyclops' sake Polypheme, strongest of the giant race, Whom of his eye Ulysses hath deprived. For Him, Thoösa bore, Nymph of the sea From Phorcys sprung, by Ocean's mighty power Impregnated in caverns of the Deep. E'er since that day, the Shaker of the shores, Although he slay him not, yet devious drives Ulysses from his native isle afar. Yet come—in full assembly his return Contrive we now, both means and prosperous end; So Neptune shall his wrath remit, whose power In contest with the force of all the Gods Exerted single, can but strive in vain. To whom Minerva, Goddess azure-eyed. Oh Jupiter! above all Kings enthroned! If the Immortals ever-blest ordain That wise Ulysses to his home return, Dispatch we then Hermes the Argicide, Our messenger, hence to Ogygia's isle, Who shall inform Calypso, nymph divine, Of this our fixt resolve, that to his home Ulysses, toil-enduring Chief, repair. Myself will hence to Ithaca, meantime, His son to animate, and with new force Inspire, that (the Achaians all convened In council,) he may, instant, bid depart The suitors from his home, who, day by day, His numerous flocks and fatted herds consume. And I will send him thence to Sparta forth, And into sandy Pylus, there to hear (If hear he may) some tidings of his Sire, And to procure himself a glorious name. This said, her golden sandals to her feet She bound, ambrosial, which o'er all the earth And o'er the moist flood waft her fleet as air; Then, seizing her strong spear pointed with brass, In length and bulk and weight a matchless beam, With which the Jove-born Goddess levels ranks Of Heroes, against whom her anger burns, From the Olympian summit down she flew, And on the threshold of Ulysses' hall In Ithaca, and within his vestibule Apparent stood; there, grasping her bright spear, Mentes We are told that Homer was under obligations to Mentes, who had frequently given him a passage in his ship to different countries which he wished to see, for which reason he has here immortalized him. she seem'd, the hospitable Chief Of Taphos' isle. She found the haughty throng The suitors; they before the palace gate With ivory cubes sported, on numerous hides Reclined of oxen which themselves had slain. The heralds and the busy menials there Minister'd to them; these their mantling cups With water slaked; with bibulous sponges those Made clean the tables, set the banquet on, And portion'd out to each his plenteous share. Long ere the rest Telemachus himself Mark'd her, for sad amid them all he sat, Pourtraying in deep thought contemplative His noble Sire, and questioning if yet Perchance the Hero might return to chase From all his palace that imperious herd, To his own honour lord of his own home. Amid them musing thus, sudden he saw The Goddess, and sprang forth, for he abhorr'd To see a guest's admittance long delay'd; Approaching eager, her right hand he seized, The brazen spear took from her, and in words With welcome wing'd Minerva thus address'd. Stranger, all hail! to share our cordial love Thou comest; the banquet finish'd, thou shalt next Inform me wherefore thou hast here arrived. So saying, toward the spacious hall he moved, Follow'd by Pallas, and, arriving soon Beneath the lofty roof, placed her bright spear Within a pillar's cavity, long time The armoury where many a spear had stood, Bright weapons of his own illustrious Sire. Then, leading her toward a footstool'd throne Magnificent, which first he overspread With linen, there he seated her, apart From that rude throng, and for himself disposed A throne of various colours at her side, Lest, stunn'd with clamour of the lawless band, The new-arrived should loth perchance to eat, And that more free he might the stranger's ear With questions of his absent Sire address. And now a maiden charged with golden ewer, And with an argent laver, pouring first Pure water on their hands, supplied them, next, With a resplendent table, which the chaste Directress of the stores furnish'd with bread And dainties, remnants of the last regale. Then, in his turn, the sewer Milton uses the word— ? Sewers and seneschals. with savoury meats, Dish after dish, served them, of various kinds, And golden cups beside the chargers placed, Which the attendant herald fill'd with wine. Ere long, in rush'd the suitors, and the thrones And couches occupied, on all whose hands The heralds pour'd pure water; then the maids Attended them with bread in baskets heap'd, And eager they assail'd the ready feast. At length, when neither thirst nor hunger more They felt unsatisfied, to new delights Their thoughts they turn'd, to song and sprightly dance, Enlivening sequel of the banquet's joys. An herald, then, to Phemius' hand consign'd His beauteous lyre; he through constraint regaled The suitors with his song, and while the chords He struck in prelude to his pleasant strains, Telemachus his head inclining nigh To Pallas' ear, lest others should his words Witness, the blue-eyed Goddess thus bespake. My inmate and my friend! far from my lips Be every word that might displease thine ear! The song—the harp,—what can they less than charm These wantons? who the bread unpurchased eat Of one whose bones on yonder continent Lie mouldering, drench'd by all the showers of heaven, Or roll at random in the billowy deep. Ah! could they see him once to his own isle Restored, both gold and raiment they would wish Far less, and nimbleness of foot instead. But He, alas! hath by a wretched fate Past question perish'd, and what news soe'er We hear of his return, kindles no hope In us, convinced that he returns no more. But answer undissembling; tell me true; Who art thou? whence? where stands thy city? where Thy father's mansion? In what kind of ship Camest thou? Why steer'd the mariners their course To Ithaca, and of what land are they? For that on foot thou found'st us not, is sure. This also tell me, hast thou now arrived New to our isle, or wast thou heretofore My father's guest? since many to our house Resorted in those happier days, for he Drew powerful to himself the hearts of all. Then Pallas thus, Goddess cœrulean-eyed. I will with all simplicity of truth Thy questions satisfy. Behold in me Mentes, the offspring of a Chief renown'd In war, Anchialus; and I rule, myself, An island race, the Taphians oar-expert. With ship and mariners I now arrive, Seeking a people of another tongue Athwart the gloomy flood, in quest of brass For which I barter steel, ploughing the waves To Temesa. My ship beneath the woods Of Neïus, at yonder field that skirts Your city, in the haven Rhethrus rides. We are hereditary guests; our Sires Were friends long since; as, when thou seest him next, The Hero old Laertes will avouch, Of whom, I learn, that he frequents no more The city now, but in sequester'd scenes Dwells sorrowful, and by an ancient dame With food and drink supplied oft as he feels Refreshment needful to him, while he creeps Between the rows of his luxuriant vines. But I have come drawn hither by report, Which spake thy Sire arrived, though still it seems The adverse Gods his homeward course retard. For not yet breathless lies the noble Chief, But in some island of the boundless flood Resides a prisoner, by barbarous force Of some rude race detain'd reluctant there. And I will now foreshow thee what the Gods Teach me, and what, though neither augur skill'd Nor prophet, I yet trust shall come to pass. He shall not, henceforth, live an exile long From his own shores, no, not although in bands Of iron held, but will ere long contrive His own return; for in expedients, framed With wondrous ingenuity, he abounds. But tell me true; art thou, in stature such, Son of himself Ulysses? for thy face And eyes bright-sparkling, strongly indicate Ulysses in thee. Frequent have we both Conversed together thus, thy Sire and I, Ere yet he went to Troy, the mark to which So many Princes of Achaia steer'd. Him since I saw not, nor Ulysses me. To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied. Stranger! I tell thee true; my mother's voice Affirms me his, but, since no mortal knows His derivation, I affirm it not. Would I had been son of some happier sire, Ordain'd in calm possession of his own To reach the verge of life. But now, report Proclaims me his, whom I of all mankind Unhappiest deem.—Thy question is resolved. Then answer thus Pallas blue-eyed return'd. From no ignoble race, in future days, The Gods shall prove thee sprung, whom so endow'd With every grace Penelope hath borne. But tell me true. What festival is this? This throng,—whence are they? wherefore hast thou need Of such a multitude? Behold I here A banquet, or a nuptial feast? for these Meet not by contribution ??????, a convivial meeting, at which every man paid his proportion, at least contributed something; but it seems to have been a meeting at which strict sobriety was observed, else Pallas would not have inferred from the noise and riot of this, that it was not such a one. to regale, With such brutality and din they hold Their riotous banquet! A wise man and good Arriving, now, among them, at the sight Of such enormities would much be wroth. To whom replied Telemachus discrete. Since, stranger! thou hast ask'd, learn also this. While yet Ulysses with his people dwelt, His presence warranted the hope that here Virtue should dwell and opulence; but Heaven Hath cast for us, at length, a different lot, And he is lost, as never man before. For I should less lament even his death, Had he among his friends at Ilium fallen, Or in the arms of his companions died, Troy's siege accomplish'd. Then his tomb the Greeks Of every tribe had built, and for his son, He had immortal glory atchieved; but now, By harpies torn inglorious, beyond reach Of eye or ear he lies; and hath to me Grief only, and unceasing sighs bequeath'd. Nor mourn I for his sake alone; the Gods Have plann'd for me still many a woe beside; For all the rulers of the neighbour isles, Samos, Dulichium, and the forest-crown'd Zacynthus, others also, rulers here In craggy Ithaca, my mother seek In marriage, and my household stores consume. But neither she those nuptial rites abhorr'd Refuses absolute, nor yet consents To end them; they my patrimony waste Meantime, and will not long spare even me. To whom, with deep commiseration pang'd, Pallas replied. Alas! great need hast thou Of thy long absent father to avenge These numerous wrongs; for could he now appear There, at yon portal, arm'd with helmet, shield, And grasping his two spears, such as when first I saw him drinking joyous at our board, From Ilus son of Mermeris, who dwelt In distant Ephyre, just then return'd, (For thither also had Ulysses gone In his swift bark, seeking some poisonous drug Wherewith to taint his brazen arrows keen, Which drug through fear of the eternal Gods Ilus refused him, and my father free Gave to him, for he loved him past belief;) Could now, Ulysses, clad in arms as then, Mix with these suitors, short his date of life To each, and bitter should his nuptials prove. But these events, whether he shall return To take just vengeance under his own roof, Or whether not, lie all in the Gods' lap. Meantime I counsel thee, thyself to think By what means likeliest thou shalt expel These from thy doors. Now mark me: close attend. To-morrow, summoning the Greecian Chiefs To council, speak to them, and call the Gods To witness that solemnity. Bid go The suitors hence, each to his own abode. Thy mother—if her purpose be resolved On marriage, let her to the house return Of her own potent father, who, himself, Shall furnish forth her matrimonial rites, And ample dower, such as it well becomes A darling daughter to receive, bestow. But hear me now; thyself I thus advise. The prime of all thy ships preparing, mann'd With twenty rowers, voyage hence to seek Intelligence of thy long-absent Sire. Some mortal may inform thee, or a word ????—a word spoken, with respect to the speaker, casually; but with reference to the inquirer supposed to be sent for his information by the especial appointment and providential favour of the Gods., Perchance, by Jove directed (safest source Of notice to mankind) may reach thine ear. First voyaging to Pylus, there enquire Of noble Nestor; thence to Sparta tend, To question Menelaus amber-hair'd, Latest arrived of all the host of Greece. There should'st thou learn that still thy father lives, And hope obtain of his return, although Distress'd, thou wilt be patient yet a year. But should'st thou there hear tidings that he breathes No longer, to thy native isle return'd, First heap his tomb; then with such pomp perform His funeral rites as his great name demands, And make thy mother's spousals, next, thy care. These duties satisfied, deliberate last Whether thou shalt these troublers of thy house By stratagem, or by assault, destroy: For thou art now no child, nor longer mayest Sport like one. Hast thou not the proud report Heard, how Orestes hath renown acquired With all mankind his father's murtherer Ægisthus slaying, the deceiver base Who slaughter'd Agamemnon? Oh my friend! (For with delight thy vigorous growth I view, And just proportion,) be thou also bold, And merit praise from ages yet to come. But I will to my vessel now repair, And to my mariners, whom, absent long, I may perchance have troubled. Weigh thou well My counsel; let not my advice be lost. To whom Telemachus discrete replied. Stranger! thy words bespeak thee much my friend, Who, as a father teaches his own son, Has taught me, and I never will forget. But, though in haste thy voyage to pursue, Yet stay, that in the bath refreshing first Thy limbs now weary, thou may'st sprightlier seek Thy gallant bark, charged with some noble gift Of finish'd workmanship, which thou shalt keep As my memorial ever; such a boon As men confer on guests whom much they love. Then Pallas thus, Goddess cœrulean-eyed. Retard me not, for go I must; the gift Which liberal thou desirest to bestow, Give me at my return, that I may bear The treasure home; and, in exchange, thyself Expect some gift equivalent from me. She spake, and as with eagle-wings upborne, Vanish'd incontinent, but him inspired With daring fortitude, and on his heart Dearer remembrance of his Sire impress'd Than ever. Conscious of the wonderous change, Amazed he stood, and in his secret thought Revolving all, believed his guest a God. The youthful Hero to the suitors then Repair'd; they silent, listen'd to the song Of the illustrious Bard; he the return Deplorable of the Achaian host From Ilium by command of Pallas, sang. Penelope, Icarius' daughter, mark'd Meantime the song celestial, where she sat In the superior palace; down she came, By all the numerous steps of her abode; Not sole, for two fair handmaids follow'd her. She then, divinest of her sex, arrived In presence of that lawless throng, beneath The portal of her stately mansion stood, Between her maidens, and with lucid veil Her lovely features mantling. There, profuse She wept, and thus the sacred bard bespake. Phemius! for many a sorrow-soothing strain Thou know'st beside, such as exploits record Of Gods and men, the poet's frequent theme; Give them of those a song, and let themselves Their wine drink noiseless; but this mournful strain Break off, unfriendly to my bosom's peace, And which of all hearts nearest touches mine; With such regret my dearest lord I mourn, Remembering still an husband praised from side To side, and in the very heart of Greece. Then answer thus Telemachus return'd. My mother! wherefore should it give thee pain If the delightful bard that theme pursue To which he feels his mind impell'd? the bard Blame not, but rather Jove, who, as he wills, Materials for poetic art supplies. No fault is his, if the disastrous fate He sing of the Achaians, for the song Wins ever from the hearers most applause That has been least in use. Of all who fought At Troy, Ulysses hath not lost, alone, His day of glad return; but many a Chief Hath perish'd also. Seek thou then again Thy own apartment, spindle ply and loom, And task thy maidens; management belongs To men of joys convivial, and of men Especially to me, chief ruler here. She heard astonish'd; and the prudent speech Reposing of her son deep in her heart, Again with her attendant maidens sought Her upper chamber. There arrived, she wept Her lost Ulysses, till Minerva bathed Her weary lids in dewy sleep profound. Then echoed through the palace dark-bedimm'd With evening shades, the suitors' boisterous roar, For each the royal bed burn'd to partake, Whom thus Telemachus discrete address'd. All ye my mother's suitors, though addict To contumacious wrangling fierce, suspend Your clamour, for a course to me it seems More decent far, when such a bard as this, Godlike for sweetness, sings, to hear his song. To-morrow meet we in full council all, That I may plainly warn you to depart From this our mansion. Seek ye where ye may Your feasts; consume your own, alternate fed Each at the other's cost; but if it seem Wisest in your account and best, to eat Voracious thus the patrimonial goods Of one man, rendering There is in the Original an evident stress laid on the word ????????, which is used in both places. It was a sort of Lex Talionis which Telemachus hoped might be put in force against them; and that Jove would demand no satisfaction for the lives of those, who made him none for the waste of his property. no account of all, Bite to the roots; but know that I will cry Ceaseless to the eternal Gods, in hope That Jove, for retribution of the wrong, Shall doom you, where ye have intruded, there To bleed, and of your blood ask There is in the Original an evident stress laid on the word ????????, which is used in both places. It was a sort of Lex Talionis which Telemachus hoped might be put in force against them; and that Jove would demand no satisfaction for the lives of those, who made him none for the waste of his property. no account. He ended, and each gnaw'd his lip, aghast At his undaunted hardiness of speech. Then thus Antinoüs spake, Eupithes' son. Telemachus! the Gods, methinks, themselves Teach thee sublimity, and to pronounce Thy matter fearless. Ah forbid it, Jove! That one so eloquent should with the weight Of kingly cares in Ithaca be charged, A realm, by claim hereditary, thine. Then prudent thus Telemachus replied. Although my speech, Antinoüs, may, perchance, Provoke thee, know that I am not averse From kingly cares, if Jove appoint me such. Seems it to thee a burthen to be fear'd By men above all others? trust me, no. There is no ill in royalty; the man So station'd, waits not long ere he obtain Riches and honour. But I grant that Kings Of the Achaians may no few be found In sea-girt Ithaca both young and old, Of whom since great Ulysses is no more, Reign whoso may; but King, myself, I am In my own house, and over all my own Domestics, by Ulysses gained for me. To whom Eurymachus replied, the son Of Polybus. What Greecian Chief shall reign In sea-girt Ithaca, must be referr'd To the Gods' will, Telemachus! meantime Thou hast unquestionable right to keep Thy own, and to command in thy own house. May never that man on her shores arrive, While an inhabitant shall yet be left In Ithaca, who shall by violence wrest Thine from thee. But permit me, noble Sir! To ask thee of thy guest. Whence came the man? What country claims him? Where are to be found His kindred and his patrimonial fields? Brings he glad tidings of thy Sire's approach Homeward? or came he to receive a debt Due to himself? How swift he disappear'd! Nor opportunity to know him gave To those who wish'd it; for his face and air Him speak not of Plebeian birth obscure. Whom answer'd thus Telemachus discrete. Eurymachus! my father comes no more. I can no longer, now, tidings believe, If such arrive; nor heed I more the song Of sooth-sayers whom my mother may consult. But this my guest hath known in other days My father, and he came from Taphos, son Of brave Anchialus, Mentes by name, And Chief of the sea-practised Taphian race. So spake Telemachus, but in his heart Knew well his guest a Goddess from the skies. Then they to dance and heart-enlivening song Turn'd joyous, waiting the approach of eve, And dusky evening found them joyous still. Then each, to his own house retiring, sought Needful repose. Meantime Telemachus To his own lofty chamber, built in view Of the wide hall, retired; but with a heart In various musings occupied intense. Sage Euryclea, bearing in each hand A torch, preceded him; her sire was Ops, Pisenor's son, and in her early prime, At his own cost Laertes made her his, Paying with twenty beeves her purchase-price. Nor in less honour than his spotless wife He held her ever, but his consort's wrath Fearing, at no time call'd her to his bed. She bore the torches, and with truer heart Loved him than any of the female train, For she had nursed him in his infant years. He open'd his broad chamber-valves, and sat On his couch-side; then, putting off his vest Of softest texture, placed it in the hands Of the attendant dame discrete, who first Folding it with exactest care, beside His bed suspended it, and, going forth, Drew by its silver ring the portal close, And fasten'd it with bolt and brace secure. There lay Telemachus, on finest wool Reposed, contemplating all night his course Prescribed by Pallas to the Pylian shore. BOOK II. ARGUMENT OF THE SECOND BOOK. Telemachus having convened an assembly of the Greecians, publicly calls on the Suitors to relinquish the house of Ulysses. During the continuance of the Council he has much to suffer from the petulance of the Suitors, from whom having informed them of his design to undertake a voyage in hope to obtain news of Ulysses, he asks a ship, with all things necessary for the purpose. He is refused, but is afterwards furnished with what he wants by Minerva, in the form of Mentor. He embarks in the evening without the privity of his mother, and the Goddess sails with him. Aurora, rosy daughter of the dawn, Now tinged the East, when, habited again, Uprose Ulysses' offspring from his bed. Athwart his back his faulchion keen he slung, His sandals bound to his unsullied feet, And, Godlike, issued from his chamber-door. At once the clear-voiced heralds he enjoin'd To call the Greeks to council; they aloud Gave forth the summons, and the throng began. When all were gather'd, and the assembly full, Himself, his hand arm'd with a brazen spear, Went also; nor alone he went; his hounds Fleet-footed follow'd him a faithful pair. O'er all his form Minerva largely shed Majestic grace divine, and, as he went, The whole admiring concourse gazed on him. The seniors gave him place, and down he sat On his paternal Throne. Then grave arose The Hero, old Ægyptius; bow'd with age Was he, and by experience deep-inform'd. His son had with Ulysses, godlike Chief, On board his fleet to steed-famed Ilium gone, The warrior Antiphus, whom in his cave The savage Cyclops slew, and on his flesh At evening made obscene his last regale. Three sons he had beside, a suitor one, Eurynomus; the other two, employ Found constant managing their Sire's concerns. Yet he forgat not, father as he was Of these, his absent eldest whom he mourn'd Ceaseless, and thus his speech, weeping, began. Hear me, ye men of Ithaca, my friends! Nor council here nor session hath been held Since great Ulysses left his native shore. Who now convenes us? what especial need Hath urged him, whether of our youth he be, Or of our senators by age matured? Have tidings reach'd him of our host's return, Which here he would divulge? or brings he aught Of public import on a different theme? I deem him, whomsoe'er he be, a man Worthy to prosper, and may Jove vouchsafe The full performance of his chief desire! He ended, and Telemachus rejoiced In that good omen. Ardent to begin, He sat not long, but moving to the midst, Received the sceptre from Pisenor's hand, His prudent herald, and addressing, next, The hoary Chief Ægyptius, thus began. Not far remote, as thou shalt soon thyself Perceive, oh venerable Chief! he stands, Who hath convened this council. I, am He. I am in chief the sufferer. Tidings none Of the returning host I have received, Which here I would divulge, nor bring I aught Of public import on a different theme, But my own trouble, on my own house fallen, And two-fold fallen. One is, that I have lost A noble father, who, as fathers rule Benign their children, govern'd once yourselves; The other, and the more alarming ill, With ruin threatens my whole house, and all My patrimony with immediate waste. Suitors, (their children who in this our isle Hold highest rank,) importunate besiege My mother, though desirous not to wed; And rather than resort to her own Sire Icarius, who might give his daughter dower, And portion her to whom he most approves, (A course which, only named, moves their disgust,) They chuse, assembling all within my gates Daily to make my beeves, my sheep, my goats Their banquet, and to drink without restraint My wine; whence ruin threatens us and ours; For I have no Ulysses to relieve Me and my family from this abuse. Ourselves are not sufficient; we, alas! Too feeble should be found, and yet to learn How best to use the little force we own; Else, had I power, I would, myself, redress The evil; for it now surpasses far All sufferance, now they ravage uncontroul'd, Nor show of decency vouchsafe me more. Oh be The reader is to be reminded that this is not an assembly of the suitors only, but a general one, which affords Telemachus an opportunity to apply himself to the feelings of the Ithacans at large. ashamed yourselves; blush at the thought Of such reproach as ye shall sure incur From all our neighbour states, and fear beside The wrath of the Immortals, lest they call Yourselves one day to a severe account. I pray you by Olympian Jove, by her Whose voice convenes all councils, and again Dissolves them, Themis, that henceforth ye cease, That ye permit me, oh my friends! to wear My days in solitary grief away, Unless Ulysses, my illustrious Sire, Hath in his anger any Greecian wrong'd Whose wrongs ye purpose to avenge on me, Inciting these to plague me. Better far Were my condition, if yourselves consumed My substance and my revenue; from you I might obtain, perchance, righteous amends Hereafter; you I might with vehement suit O'ercome, from house to house pleading aloud For recompense, till I at last prevail'd; But now, with darts of anguish ye transfix My inmost soul, and I have no redress. He spake impassion'd, and to earth cast down His sceptre, weeping. Pity at the sight Seized all the people; mute the assembly sat Long time, none dared to greet Telemachus With answer rough, till of them all, at last, Antinoüs, sole arising, thus replied. Telemachus, intemperate in harangue, High-sounding orator! it is thy drift To make us all odious; but the offence Lies not with us the suitors; she alone Thy mother, who in subtlety excels, And deep-wrought subterfuge, deserves the blame. It is already the third year, and soon Shall be the fourth, since with delusive art Practising on their minds, she hath deceived The Greecians; message after message sent Brings hope to each, by turns, and promise fair, But she, meantime, far otherwise intends. Her other arts exhausted all, she framed This stratagem; a web of amplest size And subtlest woof beginning, thus she spake. Princes, my suitors! since the noble Chief Ulysses is no more, press not as yet My nuptials; wait till I shall finish, first, A funeral robe (lest all my threads decay) Which for the ancient Hero I prepare, Laertes, looking for the mournful hour When fate shall snatch him to eternal rest; Else, I the censure dread of all my sex, Should he, so wealthy, want at last a shroud. So spake the Queen, and unsuspicious, we With her request complied. Thenceforth, all day She wove the ample web, and by the aid Of torches ravell'd it again at night. Three years by such contrivance she deceived The Greecians; but when (three whole years elapsed) The fourth arrived, then conscious of the fraud, A damsel of her train told all the truth, And her we found raveling the beauteous work. Thus, through necessity she hath, at length, Perform'd the task, and in her own despight. Now therefore, for the information clear Of thee thyself, and of the other Greeks, We answer. Send thy mother hence, with charge That him she wed, on whom her father's choice Shall fall, and whom she shall herself approve. But if by long procrastination still She persevere, wearing our patience out, Attentive only to display the gifts By Pallas so profusely dealt to her, Works of surpassing skill, ingenious thought, And subtle shifts, such as no beauteous Greek (For aught that we have heard) in ancient times E'er practised, Tyro, or Alcmena fair, Or fair Mycene, of whom none in art E'er match'd Penelope, although we yield To this her last invention little praise, Then know, that these her suitors will consume So long thy patrimony and thy goods, As she her present purpose shall indulge, With which the Gods inspire her. Great renown She to herself insures, but equal woe And devastation of thy wealth to thee; For neither to our proper works at home Go we, of that be sure, nor yet elsewhere, Till him she wed, to whom she most inclines. Him prudent, then, answer'd Telemachus. Antinoüs! it is not possible That I should thrust her forth against her will, Who both produced and rear'd me. Be he dead, Or still alive, my Sire is far remote; And should I, voluntary, hence dismiss My mother to Icarius, I must much Refund, which hardship were and loss to me. So doing, I should also wrath incur From my offended Sire, and from the Gods Still more; for she, departing, would invoke Erynnis to avenge her, and reproach Beside would follow me from all mankind. That word I, therefore never will pronounce. No; if ye judge your treatment at her hands Injurious to you, go ye forth yourselves, Forsake my mansion; seek where else ye may Your feasts; consume your own; alternate feed Each at the other's cost. But if it seem Wisest in your account and best to eat Voracious thus the patrimonial goods Of one man, rendering no account of all, Bite to the roots; but know that I will cry Ceaseless to the eternal Gods, in hope That Jove in retribution of the wrong, Shall doom you, where ye have intruded, there To bleed, and of your blood ask no account. So spake Telemachus, and while he spake, The Thunderer from a lofty mountain-top Turn'd off two eagles; on the winds, awhile, With outspread pinions ample side by side They floated; but, ere long, hovering aloft, Right o'er the midst of the assembled Chiefs They wheel'd around, clang'd all their numerous plumes, And with a downward look eyeing the throng, Death boded, ominous; then rending each The other's face and neck, they sprang at once Toward the right, and darted through the town. Amazement universal, at that sight, Seized the assembly, and with anxious thought Each scann'd the future; amidst whom arose The Hero Halitherses, ancient Seer, Offspring of Mastor; for in judgement he Of portents augural, and in forecast Unerring, his coevals all excell'd, And prudent thus the multitude bespake. Ye men of Ithaca, give ear! hear all! Though chief my speech shall to the suitors look, For, on their heads devolved, comes down the woe. Ulysses shall not from his friends, henceforth, Live absent long, but, hasting to his home, Comes even now, and as he comes, designs A bloody death for these, whose bitter woes No few shall share, inhabitants with us Of pleasant Ithaca; but let us frame Effectual means maturely to suppress Their violent deeds, or rather let themselves Repentant cease; and soonest shall be best. Not inexpert, but well-inform'd I speak The future, and the accomplishment announce Of all which when Ulysses with the Greeks Embark'd for Troy, I to himself foretold. I said that, after many woes, and loss Of all his people, in the twentieth year, Unknown to all, he should regain his home, And my prediction shall be now fulfill'd. Him, then, Eurymachus thus answer'd rough The son of Polybus. Hence to thy house, Thou hoary dotard! there, prophetic, teach Thy children to escape woes else to come. Birds numerous flutter in the beams of day, Not all predictive. Death, far hence remote Hath found Ulysses, and I would to heaven That, where he died, thyself had perish'd too: Thou hadst not then run o'er with prophecy As now, nor provocation to the wrath Given of Telemachus, in hope to win, Perchance, for thine some favour at his hands. But I to thee foretell, skill'd as thou art In legends old, (nor shall my threat be vain,) That if by artifice thou move to wrath A younger than thyself, no matter whom, Woe first the heavier on himself shall fall, Nor shalt thou profit him by thy attempt; And we will charge thee also with a mulct, Which thou shalt pay with difficulty, and bear The burthen of it with an aching heart. As for Telemachus, I him advise, Myself, and press the measure on his choice Earnestly, that he send his mother hence To her own father's house, who shall, himself, Set forth her nuptial rites, and shall endow His daughter sumptuously, and as he ought. For this expensive wooing, as I judge, Till then shall never cease; since we regard No man—no—not Telemachus, although In words exuberant; neither fear we aught Thy vain prognostics, venerable sir! But only hate thee for their sake the more. Waste will continue and disorder foul Unremedied, so long as she shall hold The suitors in suspense, for, day by day, Our emulation goads us to the strife, Nor shall we, going hence, seek to espouse Each his own consort suitable elsewhere. To whom, discrete, Telemachus replied. Eurymachus, and ye the suitor train Illustrious, I have spoken; ye shall hear No more this supplication urged by me. The Gods, and all the Greeks, now know the truth. But give me instantly a gallant bark With twenty rowers, skill'd their course to win To whatsoever haven; for I go To sandy Pylus, and shall hasten thence To Lacedemon, tidings to obtain Of my long-absent Sire, or from the lips Of man, or by a word from Jove vouchsafed Himself, best source of notice to mankind. If, there inform'd that still my father lives I hope conceive of his return, although Distress'd, I shall be patient yet a year. But should I learn, haply, that he survives No longer, then, returning, I will raise At home his tomb, will with such pomp perform His funeral rites, as his great name demands, And give my mother's hand to whom I may. This said, he sat, and after him arose Mentor, illustrious Ulysses' friend, To whom, embarking thence, he had consign'd All his concerns, that the old Chief might rule His family, and keep the whole secure. Arising, thus the senior, sage, began. Hear me, ye Ithacans! be never King Henceforth, benevolent, gracious, humane Or righteous, but let every sceptred hand Rule merciless, and deal in wrong alone, Since none of all his people, whom he sway'd With such paternal gentleness and love, Remembers the divine Ulysses more! That the imperious suitors thus should weave The web of mischief and atrocious wrong, I grudge not; since at hazard of their heads They make Ulysses' property a prey, Persuaded that the Hero comes no more. But much the people move me; how ye sit All mute, and though a multitude, yourselves, Opposed to few, risk not a single word To check the licence of these bold intruders! Then thus Liocritus, Evenor's son. Injurious Mentor! headlong orator! How darest thou move the populace against The suitors? Trust me they should find it hard, Numerous as they are, to cope with us, A feast the prize. Or should the King himself Of Ithaca, returning, undertake To expel the jovial suitors from his house, Much as Penelope his absence mourns, His presence should afford her little joy; For fighting sole with many, he should meet A dreadful death. Thou, therefore, speak'st amiss. As for Telemachus, let Mentor him And Halytherses furnish forth, the friends Long valued of his Sire, with all dispatch; Though him I judge far likelier to remain Long time contented an enquirer here, Than to perform the voyage now proposed. Thus saying, Liocritus dissolved in haste The council, and the scatter'd concourse sought Their several homes, while all the suitors flock'd Thence to the palace of their absent King. Meantime, Telemachus from all resort Retiring, in the surf of the grey Deep First laved his hands, then, thus to Pallas pray'd. O Goddess! who wast yesterday a guest Beneath my roof, and didst enjoin me then A voyage o'er the sable Deep in quest Of tidings of my long-regretted Sire! Which voyage, all in Ithaca, but most The haughty suitors, obstinate impede, Now hear my suit and gracious interpose! Such prayer he made; then Pallas, in the form, And with the voice of Mentor, drawing nigh, In accents wing'd, him kindly thus bespake. Telemachus! thou shalt hereafter prove Nor base, nor poor in talents. If, in truth, Thou have received from heaven thy father's force Instill'd into thee, and resemblest him In promptness both of action and of speech, Thy voyage shall not useless be, or vain. But if Penelope produced thee not His son, I, then, hope not for good effect Of this design which, ardent, thou pursuest. Few sons their fathers equal; most appear Degenerate; but we find, though rare, sometimes A son superior even to his Sire. And since thyself shalt neither base be found Nor spiritless, nor altogether void Of talents, such as grace thy royal Sire, I therefore hope success of thy attempt. Heed not the suitors' projects; neither wise Are they, nor just, nor aught suspect the doom Which now approaches them, and in one day Shall overwhelm them all. No long suspense Shall hold thy purposed enterprize in doubt, Such help from me, of old thy father's friend, Thou shalt receive, who with a bark well-oar'd Will serve thee, and myself attend thee forth. But haste, join thou the suitors, and provide, In separate vessels stow'd, all needful stores, Wine in thy jars, and flour, the strength of man, In skins close seam'd. I will, meantime, select Such as shall voluntary share thy toils. In sea-girt Ithaca new ships and old Abound, and I will chuse, myself, for thee The prime of all, which without more delay We will launch out into the spacious Deep. Thus Pallas spake, daughter of Jove; nor long, So greeted by the voice divine, remain'd Telemachus, but to his palace went Distress'd in heart. He found the suitors there Goats flaying in the hall, and fatted swine Roasting; when with a laugh Antinoüs flew To meet him, fasten'd on his hand, and said. Telemachus, in eloquence sublime, And of a spirit not to be controul'd! Give harbour in thy breast on no account To after-grudge or enmity, but eat, Far rather, cheerfully as heretofore, And freely drink, committing all thy cares To the Achaians, who shall furnish forth A gallant ship and chosen crew for thee, That thou may'st hence to Pylus with all speed, Tidings to learn of thy illustrious Sire. To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied. Antinoüs! I have no heart to feast With guests so insolent, nor can indulge The pleasures of a mind at ease, with you. Is 't not enough, suitors, that ye have used My noble patrimony as your own While I was yet a child? now, grown mature, And competent to understand the speech Of my instructors, feeling, too, a mind Within me conscious of augmented powers, I will attempt your ruin, be assured, Whether at Pylus, or continuing here. I go, indeed, (nor shall my voyage prove Of which I speak, bootless or vain,) I go An humble passenger, who neither bark Nor rowers have to boast my own, denied That honour (so ye judged it best) by you. He said, and from Antinoüs' hand his own Drew sudden. Then their delicate repast The busy suitors on all sides prepared, Still taunting as they toil'd, and with sharp speech Sarcastic wantoning, of whom a youth, Arrogant as his fellows, thus began. I see it plain, Telemachus intends Our slaughter; either he will aids procure From sandy Pylus, or will bring them arm'd From Sparta; such is his tremendous drift. Even to fruitful Ephyre, perchance, He will proceed, seeking some baneful herb Which cast into our cup, shall drug us all. To whom some haughty suitor thus replied. Who knows but that himself, wandering the sea From all his friends and kindred far remote, May perish like Ulysses? Whence to us Should double toil ensue, on whom the charge To parcel out his wealth would then devolve, And to endow his mother with the house For his abode whom she should chance to wed. So sported they; but he, ascending, sought His father's lofty chamber, where his heaps He kept of brass and gold, garments in chests, And oils of fragrant scent, a copious store. There many a cask with season'd nectar fill'd The grape's pure juice divine, beside the wall Stood orderly arranged, waiting the hour (Should e'er such hour arrive) when, after woes Numerous, Ulysses should regain his home. Secure that chamber was with folding doors Of massy planks compact, and, night and day, Within it ancient Euryclea dwelt, Guardian discrete of all the treasures there, Whom, thither call'd, Telemachus address'd. Nurse! draw me forth sweet wine into my jars, Delicious next to that which thou reservest For our poor wanderer; if escaping death At last, divine Ulysses e'er return. Fill twelve, and stop them close; pour also meal Well-mill'd (full twenty measures) into skins Close-seam'd, and mention what thou dost to none. Place them together; for at even-tide I will convey them hence, soon as the Queen, Retiring to her couch, shall seek repose. For hence to Sparta will I take my course, And sandy Pylus, tidings there to hear (If hear I may) of my loved Sire's return. He ceased; then wept his gentle nurse that sound Hearing, and in wing'd accents thus replied. My child! ah, wherefore hath a thought so rash Possess'd thee? whither, only and beloved, Seek'st thou to ramble, travelling, alas! To distant climes? Ulysses is no more; Dead lies the hero in some land unknown, And thou no sooner shalt depart, than these Will plot to slay thee, and divide thy wealth. No, stay with us who love thee. Need is none That thou should'st on the barren Deep distress Encounter, roaming without hope or end. Whom, prudent, thus answer'd Telemachus. Take courage, nurse! for not without consent Of the Immortals I have thus resolved. But swear, that till eleven days be past, Or twelve, or till enquiry made, she learn Herself my going, thou wilt nought impart Of this my purpose to my mother's ear, Lest all her beauties fade by grief impair'd. He ended, and the ancient matron swore Solemnly by the Gods; which done, she fill'd With wine the vessels and the skins with meal, And he, returning, join'd the throng below. Then Pallas, Goddess azure-eyed, her thoughts Elsewhere directing, all the city ranged In semblance of Telemachus, each man Exhorting, at the dusk of eve, to seek The gallant ship, and from Noëmon, son Renown'd of Phronius, ask'd, herself, a bark, Which soon as ask'd, he promised to supply. Now set the sun, and twilight dimm'd the ways, When, drawing down his bark into the Deep, He gave her all her furniture, oars, arms And tackle, such as well-built galleys bear, Then moor'd her in the bottom of the bay. Meantime, his mariners in haste repair'd Down to the shore, for Pallas urged them on. And now, on other purposes intent, The Goddess sought the palace, where with dews Of slumber drenching every suitor's eye, She fool'd the drunkard multitude, and dash'd The goblets from their idle hands away. They through the city reel'd, happy to leave The dull carousal, when the slumberous weight Oppressive on their eye-lids once had fallen. Next, Pallas azure-eyed in Mentor's form And with the voice of Mentor, summoning Telemachus abroad, him thus bespake. Telemachus! already at their oars Sit all thy fellow-voyagers, and wait Thy coming; linger not, but haste away. This said, Minerva led him thence, whom he With nimble steps follow'd, and, on the shore Arrived, found all his mariners prepared, Whom thus the princely voyager address'd. Haste, my companions! bring we down the stores Already sorted, and set forth; but nought My mother knows, or any of her train Of this design, one matron sole except. He spake, and led them; they, obedient, brought All down, and, as Ulysses' son enjoin'd, Within the gallant bark the charge bestow'd. Then, led by Pallas, went the prince on board, Where down they sat, the Goddess in the stern, And at her side Telemachus. The crew Cast loose the hawsers, and embarking, fill'd The benches. Blue-eyed Pallas from the West Call'd forth propitious breezes; fresh they curl'd The sable Deep, and, sounding, swept the waves. He loud-exhorting them, his people bade Hand, brisk, the tackle; they, obedient, reared The pine-tree mast, which in its socket deep They lodged, then strain'd the cordage, and with thongs Well-twisted, drew the shining sail aloft. A land-breeze fill'd the canvas, and the flood Roar'd as she went against the steady bark That ran with even course her liquid way. The rigging, thus, of all the galley set, Their beakers crowning high with wine, they hail'd The ever-living Gods, but above all Minerva, daughter azure-eyed of Jove. Thus, all night long the galley, and till dawn Had brighten'd into day, cleaved swift the flood. BOOK III. ARGUMENT OF THE THIRD BOOK. Telemachus arriving at Pylus, enquires of Nestor concerning Ulysses. Nestor relates to him all that he knows or has heard of the Greecians since their departure from the siege of Troy, but not being able to give him any satisfactory account of Ulysses, refers him to Menelaus. At evening Minerva quits Telemachus, but discovers herself in going. Nestor sacrifices to the Goddess, and the solemnity ended, Telemachus sets forth for Sparta in one of Nestor's chariots, and accompanied by Nestor's son Pisistratus. The sun, emerging from the lucid waves, Ascended now the brazen vault with light For the inhabitants of earth and heaven, When in their bark at Pylus they arrived, City of Neleus. On the shore they found The people sacrificing; bulls they slew Black without spot, to Neptune azure-hair'd. On ranges nine of seats they sat; each range Received five hundred, and to each they made Allotment equal of nine sable bulls. The feast was now begun; these eating sat The entrails, those stood offering to the God The thighs, his portion, when the Ithacans Push'd right ashore, and, furling close the sails, And making fast their moorings, disembark'd. Forth came Telemachus by Pallas led, Whom thus the Goddess azure-eyed address'd. Telemachus! there is no longer room For bashful fear, since thou hast cross'd the flood With purpose to enquire what land conceals Thy father, and what fate hath follow'd him. Advance at once to the equestrian Chief Nestor, within whose bosom lies, perhaps, Advice well worthy of thy search; entreat Himself, that he will tell thee only truth, Who will not lie, for he is passing wise. To whom Telemachus discrete replied. Ah Mentor! how can I advance, how greet A Chief like him, unpractised as I am In managed phrase? Shame bids the youth beware How he accosts the man of many years. But him the Goddess answer'd azure-eyed. Telemachus! Thou wilt, in part, thyself Fit speech devise, and Heaven will give the rest; For thou wast neither born, nor hast been train'd To manhood, under unpropitious Powers. So saying, Minerva led him thence, whom he With nimble steps attending, soon arrived Among the multitude. There Nestor sat, And Nestor's sons, while, busily the feast Tending, his numerous followers roasted some The viands, some transfix'd them with the spits. They seeing guests arrived, together all Advanced, and, grasping courteously their hands, Invited them to sit; but first, the son Of Nestor, young Pisistratus, approach'd, Who, fastening on the hands of both, beside The banquet placed them, where the beach was spread With fleeces, and where Thrasymedes sat His brother, and the hoary Chief his Sire. To each, a portion of the inner parts He gave, then fill'd a golden cup with wine, Which, tasted first, he to the daughter bore Of Jove the Thunderer, and her thus bespake. Oh guest! the King of Ocean now adore! For ye have chanced on Neptune's festival; And, when thou hast, thyself, libation made Duly and prayer, deliver to thy friend The generous juice, that he may also make Libation; for he, doubtless, seeks in prayer The Immortals, of whose favour all have need. But, since he younger is, and with myself Coeval, first I give the cup to thee. He ceased, and to her hand consign'd the cup, Which Pallas gladly from a youth received So just and wise, who to herself had first The golden cup presented, and in prayer Fervent the Sovereign of the Seas adored. Hear, earth-encircler Neptune! O vouchsafe To us thy suppliants the desired effect Of this our voyage; glory, first, bestow On Nestor and his offspring both, then grant To all the Pylians such a gracious boon As shall requite their noble offering well. Grant also to Telemachus and me To voyage hence, possess'd of what we sought When hither in our sable bark we came. So Pallas pray'd, and her own prayer herself Accomplish'd. To Telemachus she gave The splendid goblet next, and in his turn Like prayer Ulysses' son also preferr'd. And now (the banquet from the spits withdrawn) They next distributed sufficient share To each, and all were sumptuously regaled. At length (both hunger satisfied and thirst) Thus Nestor, the Gerenian Chief, began. Now with more seemliness we may enquire, After repast, what guests we have received. Our guests! who are ye? Whence have ye the waves Plough'd hither? Come ye to transact concerns Commercial, or at random roam the Deep Like pirates, who with mischief charged and woe To foreign States, oft hazard life themselves? Him answer'd, bolder now, but still discrete, Telemachus: for Pallas had his heart With manly courage arm'd, that he might ask From Nestor tidings of his absent Sire, And win himself distinction and renown. Oh Nestor, Neleus' son, glory of Greece! Thou askest whence we are. I tell thee whence. From Ithaca, by the umbrageous woods Of Neritus o'erhung, by private need, Not public, urged, we come. My errand is To seek intelligence of the renown'd Ulysses; of my noble father, praised For dauntless courage, whom report proclaims Conqueror, with thine aid, of sacred Troy. We have already learn'd where other Chiefs Who fought at Ilium, died; but Jove conceals Even the death of my illustrious Sire In dull obscurity; for none hath heard Or confident can answer, where he died; Whether he on the continent hath fallen By hostile hands, or by the waves o'erwhelm'd Of Amphitrite, welters in the Deep. For this cause, at thy knees suppliant, I beg That thou would'st tell me his disastrous end, If either thou beheld'st that dread event Thyself, or from some wanderer of the Greeks Hast heard it; for my father at his birth Was, sure, predestined to no common woes. Neither through pity, or o'erstrain'd respect Flatter me, but explicit all relate Which thou hast witness'd. If my noble Sire E'er gratified thee by performance just Of word or deed at Ilium, where ye fell So numerous slain in fight, oh, recollect Now his fidelity, and tell me true. Then Nestor thus Gerenian Hero old. Young friend! since thou remind'st me, speaking thus, Of all the woes which indefatigable We sons of the Achaians there sustain'd, Both those which wandering on the Deep we bore Wherever by Achilles led in quest Of booty, and the many woes beside Which under royal Priam's spacious walls We suffer'd, know, that there our bravest fell. There warlike Ajax lies, there Peleus' son; There, too, Patroclus, like the Gods themselves In council; and my son beloved there, Brave, virtuous, swift of foot, and bold in fight, Antilochus. Nor are these sorrows all; What tongue of mortal man could all relate? Should'st thou, abiding here, five years employ Or six enquiring of the woes endured By the Achaians, ere thou should'st have learn'd The whole, thou wouldst depart, tired of the tale. For we, nine years, stratagems of all kinds Devised against them, and Saturnian Jove Scarce crown'd the difficult attempt at last. There no competitor in wiles well-plann'd Ulysses found, so far were all surpass'd In shrewd invention by the noble Sire,— If thou indeed art his, as sure thou art, Whose sight breeds wonder in me, and thy speech His speech resembles more than might be deem'd Within the scope of years so green as thine. There, never in opinion, or in voice Illustrious Ulysses and myself Divided were, but one in heart, contrived As best we might, the benefit of all. But after Priam's lofty city sack'd, And the departure of the Greeks on board Their barks, and when the Gods had scatter'd them, Then Jove imagined for the Argive host A sorrowful return; for neither just Were all, nor prudent, therefore many found A fate disastrous through the vengeful ire Of Jove-born Pallas, who between the sons Of Atreus sharp contention interposed. They both, irregularly, and against Just order, summoning by night the Greeks To council, of whom many came with wine Oppress'd, promulgated the cause for which They had convened the people. Then it was That Menelaus bade the general host Their thoughts bend homeward o'er the sacred Deep, Which Agamemnon in no sort approved. His counsel was to stay them yet at Troy, That so he might assuage the dreadful wrath Of Pallas, first, by sacrifice and prayer. Vain hope! he little thought how ill should speed That fond attempt, for, once provoked, the Gods Are not with ease conciliated again. Thus stood the brothers, altercation hot Maintaining, till at length uprose the Greeks With deafening clamours, and with differing minds. We slept the night, but teeming with disgust Mutual, for Jove great woe prepared for all. At dawn of day we drew our gallies down Into the sea, and hasty put on board The spoils and female captives. Half the host, With Agamemnon, son of Atreus, stay'd Supreme commander, and embarking half Push'd forth. Swift course we made, for Neptune smooth'd The waves before us of the monstrous Deep. At Tenedos arrived, we there perform'd Sacrifice to the Gods, ardent to reach Our native land, but unpropitious Jove, Not yet designing our arrival there, Involved us in dissention fierce again. For all the crews, followers of the King, Thy noble sire, to gratify our Chief, The son of Atreus, chose a different course, And steer'd their oary barks again to Troy. But I, assured that evil from the Gods Impended, gathering all my gallant fleet, Fled thence in haste, and warlike Diomede Exhorting his attendants, also fled. At length, the Hero Menelaus join'd Our fleets at Lesbos; there he found us held In deep deliberation on the length Of way before us, whether we should steer Above the craggy Chios to the isle Psyria, that island holding on our left, Or under Chios by the wind-swept heights Of Mimas. Then we ask'd from Jove a sign, And by a sign vouchsafed he bade us cut The wide sea to Eubœa sheer athwart, So soonest to escape the threatened harm. Shrill sang the rising gale, and with swift prows Cleaving the fishy flood, we reach'd by night Geræstus, where arrived, we burn'd the thighs Of numerous bulls to Neptune, who had safe Conducted us through all our perilous course. The fleet of Diomede in safety moor'd On the fourth day at Argos, but myself Held on my course to Pylus, nor the wind One moment thwarted us, or died away, When Jove had once commanded it to blow. Thus, uninform'd, I have arrived, my son! Nor of the Greecians, who are saved have heard, Or who have perish'd; but what news soe'er I have obtain'd since my return, with truth I will relate, nor aught conceal from thee. The spear-famed Myrmidons, as rumour speaks, By Neoptolemus, illustrious son Of brave Achilles led, have safe arrived; Safe, Philoctetes also, son renown'd Of Pæas; and Idomeneus at Crete Hath landed all his followers who survive The bloody war, the waves have swallow'd none. Ye have yourselves doubtless, although remote, Of Agamemnon heard, how he return'd, And how Ægisthus cruelly contrived For him a bloody welcome, but himself Hath with his own life paid the murtherous deed. Good is it therefore if a son survive The slain, since Agamemnon's son hath well Avenged his father's death, slaying, himself, Ægisthus, foul assassin of his Sire. Young friend! (for pleased thy vigorous youth I view, And just proportion,) be thou also bold, That thine like his may be a deathless name. Then, prudent, him answer'd Telemachus. Oh Nestor, Neleus' son, glory of Greece! And righteous was that vengeance; his renown Achaia's sons shall far and wide diffuse, To future times transmitting it in song. Ah! would that such ability the Gods Would grant to me, that I, as well, the deeds Might punish of our suitors, whose excess Enormous, and whose bitter taunts I feel Continual, object of their subtle hate. But not for me such happiness the Gods Have twined into my thread; no, not for me Or for my father. Patience is our part. To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied. Young friend! (since thou remind'st me of that theme) Fame here reports that numerous suitors haunt Thy palace for thy mother's sake, and there Much evil perpetrate in thy despight. But, say, endur'st thou willing their controul Imperious, or because the people sway'd By some response oracular, incline Against thee? But who knows? the time may come When to his home restored, either alone, Or aided by the force of all the Greeks, Ulysses may avenge the wrong; at least, Should Pallas azure-eyed thee love, as erst At Troy the scene of our unnumber'd woes, She loved Ulysses; (for I have not known The Gods assisting so apparently A mortal man, as him Minerva there;) Should Pallas view thee also with like love And kind solicitude, some few of those Should dream perchance of wedlock never more. Then answer thus Telemachus return'd. That word's accomplishment I cannot hope; It promises too much; the thought alone O'erwhelms me; an event so fortunate Would, unexpected on my part, arrive, Although the Gods themselves should purpose it. But Pallas him answer'd cœrulean-eyed. Telemachus! what word was that which leap'd The ivory ????? ???????. Prior, alluding to this expression, ludicrously renders it “When words like these in vocal breath Burst from his twofold hedge of teeth.” guard that should have fenced it in? A God, so willing, could with utmost ease Save any man, howe'er remote. Myself, I had much rather, many woes endured, Revisit home at last happy and safe, Than, sooner coming, die in my own house, As Agamemnon perish'd by the arts Of base Ægisthus and the subtle Queen. Yet not the Gods themselves can save from death All-levelling, the man whom most they love, When Fate ordains him once to his last sleep. To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied. Howe'er it interest us, let us leave This question, Mentor! He, I am assured, Returns no more, but hath already found A sad, sad fate by the decree of Heaven. But I would now interrogate again Nestor, and on a different theme, for him In human rights I judge and laws expert, And in all knowledge beyond other men; For he hath govern'd, as report proclaims, Three generations; therefore in my eyes He wears the awful impress of a God. Oh Nestor, son of Neleus, tell me true; What was the matter of Atrides' death, Wide-ruling Agamemnon? Tell me where Was Menelaus? By what means contrived Ægisthus to inflict the fatal blow, Slaying so much a nobler than himself? Had not the brother of the Monarch reach'd Achaian Argos yet, but, wandering still In other climes, by his long absence gave Ægisthus courage for that bloody deed? Whom answer'd the Gerenian Chief renown'd. My son! I will inform thee true; meantime Thy own suspicions border on the fact. Had Menelaus, Hero amber-hair'd, Ægisthus found living at his return From Ilium, never on his bones the Greeks Had heap'd a tomb, but dogs and ravening fowls Had torn him lying in the open field Far from the town, nor him had woman wept Of all in Greece, for he had foul transgress'd. But we in many an arduous task engaged, Lay before Ilium; he, the while, secure Within the green retreats of Argos, found Occasion apt by flattery to delude The spouse of Agamemnon; she, at first, (The royal Clytemnestra) firm refused The deed dishonourable; (for she bore A virtuous mind, and at her side a bard Attended ever, whom the King, to Troy Departing, had appointed to the charge.) But when the Gods had purposed to ensnare Ægisthus, then dismissing far remote The bard into a desert isle, he there Abandon'd him to ravening fowls a prey, And to his own home, willing as himself Led Clytemnestra. Numerous thighs he burn'd On all their hallow'd altars to the Gods, And hung with tapestry, images, and gold Their shrines, his great exploit past hope atchieved. We (Menelaus and myself) had sailed From Troy together, but when we approach'd Sunium, headland of the Athenian shore, There Phœbus, sudden, with his gentle shafts Slew Menelaus' pilot while he steer'd The volant bark, Phrontis, Onetor's son, A mariner past all expert, whom none In steerage match'd, what time the tempest roar'd. Here therefore Menelaus was detain'd, Giving his friend due burial, and his rites Funereal celebrating, though in haste Still to proceed. But when, with all his fleet The wide sea traversing, he reach'd at length Malea's lofty foreland in his course, Rough passage, then, and perilous he found. Shrill blasts the Thunderer pour'd into his sails, And wild waves sent him mountainous. His ships There scatter'd, some to the Cydonian coast Of Crete he push'd, near where the Jardan flows. Beside the confines of Gortyna stands, Amid the gloomy flood, a smooth rock, steep Toward the sea, against whose leftward point Phæstus by name, the South wind rolls the surge Amain, which yet the rock, though small, repels. Hither with part he came, and scarce the crews Themselves escaped, while the huge billows broke Their ships against the rocks; yet five he saved, Which winds and waves drove to the Ægyptian shore. Thus he, provision gathering as he went And gold abundant, roam'd to distant lands And nations of another tongue. Meantime, Ægisthus these enormities at home Devising, slew Atrides, and supreme Ruled the subjected land; seven years he reign'd In opulent Mycenæ, but the eighth From Athens brought renown'd Orestes home For his destruction, who of life bereaved Ægisthus, base assassin of his Sire. Orestes, therefore, the funereal rites Performing to his shameless mother's shade And to her lustful paramour, a feast Gave to the Argives; on which self-same day The warlike Menelaus, with his ships All treasure-laden to the brink, arrived. And thou, young friend! from thy forsaken home Rove not long time remote, thy treasures left At mercy of those proud, lest they divide And waste the whole, rendering thy voyage vain. But hence to Menelaus is the course To which I counsel thee; for he hath come Of late from distant lands, whence to escape No man could hope, whom tempests first had driven Devious into so wide a sea, from which Themselves the birds of heaven could not arrive In a whole year, so vast is the expanse. Go, then, with ship and shipmates, or if more The land delight thee, steeds thou shalt not want Nor chariot, and my sons shall be thy guides To noble Lacedemon, the abode Of Menelaus; ask from him the truth, Who will not lie, for he is passing wise. While thus he spake, the sun declined and night Approaching, blue-eyed Pallas interposed. Oh antient King! well hast thou spoken all. But now delay not. Cut It is said to have been customary in the days of Homer, when the Greeks retired from a banquet to their beds, to cut out the tongues of the victims, and offer them to the Gods in particular who presided over conversation. ye forth the tongues, And mingle wine, that (Neptune first invoked With due libation, and the other Gods) We may repair to rest; for even now The sun is sunk, and it becomes us not Long to protract a banquet to the Gods Devote, but in fit season to depart. So spake Jove's daughter; they obedient heard. The heralds then pour'd water on their hands, And the attendant youths, filling the cups, Served them from left to right. Next all the tongues They cast into the fire, and every guest Arising, pour'd libation to the Gods. Libation made, and all with wine sufficed, Godlike Telemachus and Pallas both Would have return'd incontinent on board, But Nestor urged them still to be his guests. Forbid it, Jove, and all the Powers of heaven! That ye should leave me to repair on board Your vessel, as I were some needy wretch Cloakless and destitute of fleecy stores Wherewith to spread the couch soft for myself, Or for my guests. No. I have garments warm An ample store, and rugs of richest dye; And never shall Ulysses' son beloved, My friend's own son, sleep on a galley's plank While I draw vital air; grant also, Heaven, That, dying, I may leave behind me sons Glad to accommodate whatever guest! Him answer'd then Pallas cœrulean-eyed. Old Chief! thou hast well said, and reason bids Telemachus thy kind commands obey. Let him attend thee hence, that he may sleep Beneath thy roof, but I return on board Myself to instruct my people, and to give All needful orders; for among them none Is old as I, but they are youths alike, Coevals of Telemachus, with whom They have embark'd for friendship's sake alone. I therefore will repose myself on board This night, and to the Caucons bold in arms Will sail to-morrow to demand arrears Long time unpaid, and of no small amount. But, since he has become thy guest, afford My friend a chariot, and a son of thine Who shall direct his way, nor let him want Of all thy steeds the swiftest and the best. So saying, the blue-eyed Goddess as upborne On eagles' wings, vanish'd: amazement seized The whole assembly, and the ancient King O'erwhelm'd with wonder at that sight, the hand Grasp'd of Telemachus, whom he thus bespake. My friend! I prophecy that thou shalt prove Nor base, nor dastard, whom, so young, the Gods Already take in charge; for of the Powers Inhabitants of Heaven, none else was this Than Jove's own daughter Pallas, who among The Greecians honour'd most thy generous Sire. But thou, O Queen! compassionate us all, Myself, my sons, my consort; give to each A glorious name, and I to thee will give For sacrifice an heifer of the year, Broad-fronted, one that never yet hath borne The yoke, and will incase her horns with gold. So Nestor pray'd, whom Pallas gracious heard. Then the Gerenian warrior old, before His sons and sons in law, to his abode Magnificent proceeded; they (arrived Within the splendid palace of the King) On thrones and couches sat in order ranged, Whom Nestor welcomed, charging high the cup With wine of richest sort, which she who kept That treasure, now in the eleventh year First broach'd, unsealing the delicious juice. With this the hoary Senior fill'd a cup, And to the daughter of Jove ægis-arm'd Pouring libation, offer'd fervent prayer. When all had made libation, and no wish Remain'd of more, then each to rest retired, And Nestor the Gerenian warrior old Led thence Telemachus to a carved couch Beneath the sounding portico prepared. Beside him he bade sleep the spearman bold, Pisistratus, a gallant youth, the sole Unwedded in his house of all his sons. Himself in the interior palace lay, Where couch and covering for her ancient spouse The consort Queen had diligent prepared. But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn, Had tinged the East, arising from his bed, Gerenian Nestor issued forth, and sat Before his palace-gate on the white stones Resplendent as with oil, on which of old His father Neleus had been wont to sit, In council like a God; but he had sought, By destiny dismiss'd long since, the shades. On those stones therefore now, Nestor himself, Achaia's guardian, sat, sceptre in hand, Where soon his numerous sons, leaving betimes The place of their repose, also appeared, Echephron, Stratius, Perseus, Thrasymedes, Aretus and Pisistratus. They placed Godlike Telemachus at Nestor's side, And the Gerenian Hero thus began. Sons, be ye quick,—execute with dispatch My purpose, that I may propitiate first Of all the Gods Minerva, who herself Hath honour'd manifest our hallowed feast. Haste, one, into the field, to order thence An ox, and let the herdsman drive it home. Another, hasting to the sable bark Of brave Telemachus, bring hither all His friends, save two, and let a third command Laerceus, that he come to enwrap with gold The victim's horns. Abide ye here, the rest, And bid my female train (for I intend A banquet,) with all diligence provide Seats, stores of wood, and water from the rock. He said, whom instant all obey'd. The ox Came from the field, and from the gallant ship. The ship-mates of the brave Telemachus; Next, charged with all his implements of art, His mallet, anvil, pincers, came the smith To give the horns their gilding; also came Pallas herself to her own sacred rites. Then Nestor, hoary warrior, furnish'd gold, Which, hammer'd thin, the artist wrapp'd around The victim's horns, that seeing him attired So costly, Pallas might the more be pleased. Stratius and brave Echephron introduced The victim by his horns; Aretus brought A laver, in one hand, with flowers emboss'd, And in his other hand a basket stored With cakes, while warlike Thrasymedes, arm'd With his long-hafted axe, prepared to smite The ox, and Perseus to receive the blood. The hoary Nestor consecrated first Both cakes and water, and with earnest prayer To Pallas, gave the forelock to the flames. When all had worshipp'd, and the broken cakes Sprinkled, then godlike Thrasymedes drew Close to the ox, and smote him. Deep the edge Enter'd, and senseless on the floor he fell. Then Nestor's daughters, and the consorts all Of Nestor's sons, with his own consort, chaste Eurydice, the daughter eldest-born Of Clymenus, in one shrill orison Vociferous join'd, while they, lifting the ox, Held him supported firmly, and the prince Of men, Pisistratus, his gullet pierced. Soon as the sable blood had ceased, and life Had left the victim, spreading him abroad, With nice address they parted at the joint His thighs, and wrapp'd them in the double cawl, Which with crude slices thin they overspread. Nestor burn'd incense, and libation pour'd Large on the hissing brands, while, him beside, Busy with spit and prong, stood many a youth Train'd to the task. The thighs consumed, each took His portion of the maw, then, slashing well The remnant, they transpierced it with the spits Neatly, and held it reeking at the fire. Meantime the youngest of the daughters fair Of Nestor, beauteous Polycaste, laved, Anointed, and in vest and tunic clothed Telemachus, who, so refresh'd, stepp'd forth From the bright laver graceful as a God, And took his seat at ancient Nestor's side. The viands dress'd, and from the spits withdrawn, They sat to share the feast, and princely youths Arising, gave them wine in cups of gold. When neither hunger now nor thirst remain'd Unsated, thus Gerenian Nestor spake. My sons, arise! lead forth the sprightly steeds, And yoke them, that Telemachus may go. So spake the Chief, to whose command his sons, Obedient, yoked in haste the rapid steeds, And the intendant matron of the stores Disposed meantime within the chariot, bread And wine, with dainties, such as princes eat. Telemachus into the chariot first Ascended, and beside him, next, his place Pisistratus the son of Nestor took, Then seized the reins, and lash'd the coursers on. They, nothing loth, into the open plain Flew, leaving lofty Pylus soon afar. Thus, journeying, they shook on either side The yoke all day; and now the setting sun To dusky evening had resign'd the roads, When they to Pheræ came, and the abode Reach'd of Diocles, whose illustrious Sire Orsilochus from Alpheus drew his birth, And there, with kindness entertain'd, they slept. But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn, Look'd rosy from the East, yoking the steeds, They in their sumptuous chariot sat again. The son of Nestor plied the lash, and forth Through vestibule and sounding portico The royal coursers, not unwilling, flew. A corn-invested land received them next, And there they brought their journey to a close, So rapidly they moved; and now the sun Went down, and even-tide dimm'd all the ways. BOOK IV. ARGUMENT OF THE FOURTH BOOK. Telemachus, with Pisistratus, arrives at the palace of Menelaus, from whom he receives some fresh information concerning the return of the Greecians, and is in particular told, on the authority of Proteus, that his father is detained by Calypso. The suitors, plotting against the life of Telemachus, lie in wait to intercept him in his return to Ithaca. Penelope being informed of his departure, and of their designs to slay him, becomes inconsolable, but is relieved by a dream sent to her from Minerva. In hollow Lacedæmon's spacious vale Arriving, to the house they drove direct Of royal Menelaus; him they found In his own palace, all his numerous friends Regaling at a nuptial banquet given Both for his daughter and the prince his son. His daughter to renown'd Achilles' heir He sent, to whom he had at Troy engaged To give her, and the Gods now made her his. With chariots and with steeds he sent her forth To the illustrious city where the prince, Achilles' offspring, ruled the Myrmidons. But to his son he gave a Spartan fair, Alector's daughter; from an handmaid sprang That son to Menelaus in his age, Brave Megapenthes; for the Gods no child To Helen gave, made mother, once, of her Who vied in perfect loveliness of form With golden Venus' self, Hermione. Thus all the neighbour princes and the friends Of noble Menelaus, feasting sat Within his spacious palace, among whom A sacred bard sang sweetly to his harp, While, in the midst, two dancers smote the ground With measured steps responsive to his song. And now the Heroes, Nestor's noble son And young Telemachus, arrived within The vestibule, whom issuing from the hall, The noble Eteoneus of the train Of Menelaus, saw; at once he ran Across the palace to report the news To his Lord's ear, and standing at his side, In accents wing'd with haste thus greeted him. Oh Menelaus! Heaven-descended Chief! Two guests arrive, both strangers, but the race Of Jove supreme resembling each in form. Say, shall we loose, ourselves, their rapid steeds, Or hence dismiss them to some other host? But Menelaus, Hero golden-hair'd, Indignant answer'd him. Boethe's son! Thou wast not, Eteoneus, heretofore, A babbler, who now pratest as a child. We have ourselves arrived indebted much To hospitality of other men, If Jove shall, even here, some pause at last Of woe afford us. Therefore loose, at once, Their steeds, and introduce them to the feast. He said, and issuing, Eteoneus call'd The brisk attendants to his aid, with whom He loosed their foaming coursers from the yoke. Them first they bound to mangers, which with oats And mingled barley they supplied, then thrust The chariot sidelong to the splendid wall Hesychius tells us, that the Greecians ornamented with much attention the front wall of their courts for the admiration of passengers.. Themselves he, next, into the royal house Conducted, who survey'd, wondering, the abode Of the heaven-favour'd King; for on all sides As with the splendour of the sun or moon The lofty dome of Menelaus blazed. Satiate, at length, with wonder at that sight, They enter'd each a bath, and by the hands Of maidens laved, and oil'd, and clothed again With shaggy mantles and resplendent vests, Sat both enthroned at Menelaus' side. And now a maiden charged with golden ewer, And with an argent laver, pouring first Pure water on their hands, supplied them next, With a bright table, which the maiden, chief In office, furnish'd plenteously with bread And dainties, remnants of the last regale. Then came the sewer, who with delicious meats Dish after dish, served them, and placed beside The chargers cups magnificent of gold, When Menelaus grasp'd their hands, and said. Eat and rejoice, and when ye shall have shared Our nuptial banquet, we will, then, enquire Who are ye both; for, certain, not from those Whose generation perishes are ye, But rather of some race of sceptred Chiefs Heaven-born; the base have never sons like you. So saying, he from the board lifted his own Distinguish'd portion, and the fatted chine Gave to his guests; the savoury viands they With outstretch'd hands assail'd, and when the force No longer now of appetite they felt, Telemachus, inclining close his head To Nestor's son, lest others should his speech Witness, in whisper'd words him thus address'd. Dearest Pisistratus, observe, my friend! How all the echoing palace with the light Of beaming brass, of gold and amber shines Silver and ivory! for radiance such The interior mansion of Olympian Jove I deem. What wealth, how various, how immense Is here! astonish'd I survey the sight! But Menelaus, golden-hair'd, his speech O'erhearing, thus in accents wing'd replied. My children! let no mortal man pretend Comparison with Jove; for Jove's abode And all his stores are incorruptible. But whether mortal man with me may vie In the display of wealth, or whether not, This know, that after many toils endured, And perilous wanderings wide, in the eighth year I brought my treasures home. Remote I roved To Cyprus, to Phœnice, to the shores Of Ægypt; Æthiopia's land I reach'd, Th'Erembi, the Sidonians, and the coasts Of Libya, where the lambs their foreheads show At once with horns defended, soon as yean'd. There, thrice within the year the flocks produce, Nor master, there, nor shepherd ever feels A dearth of cheese, of flesh, or of sweet milk Delicious, drawn from udders never dry. While, thus, commodities on various coasts Gathering I roam'd, another, by the arts Of his pernicious spouse aided, of life Bereaved my brother privily, and when least He fear'd to lose it. Therefore little joy To me results from all that I possess. Your fathers (be those fathers who they may,) These things have doubtless told you; for immense Have been my sufferings, and I have destroy'd A palace well inhabited and stored With precious furniture of every kind; Such, that I would to heaven! I own'd at home Though but the third of it, and that the Greeks Who perish'd then, beneath the walls of Troy Far from steed-pastured Argos, still survived. Yet while, sequester'd here, I frequent mourn My slaughter'd friends, by turns I soothe my soul With tears shed for them, and by turns again I cease; for grief soon satiates free indulged. But of them all, although I all bewail, None mourn I so as one, whom calling back To memory, I both sleep and food abhor. For, of Achaia's sons none ever toil'd Strenuous as Ulysses; but his lot Was woe, and unremitting sorrow mine For his long absence, who, if still he live, We know not aught, or be already dead. Him doubtless, old Laertes mourns, and him Discrete Penelope, nor less his son Telemachus, born newly when he sail'd. So saying, he kindled in him strong desire To mourn his father; at his father's name Fast fell his tears to ground, and with both hands He spread his purple cloak before his eyes; Which Menelaus marking, doubtful sat If he should leave him leisure for his tears, Or question him, and tell him all at large. While thus he doubted, Helen (as it chanced) Leaving her fragrant chamber, came, august As Dian, goddess of the golden bow. Adrasta, for her use, set forth a throne, Alcippe with soft arras cover'd it, And Philo brought her silver basket, gift Of fair Alcandra, wife of Polybus, Whose mansion in Ægyptian Thebes is rich In untold treasure, and who gave, himself, Ten golden talents, and two silver baths To Menelaus, with two splendid tripods, Beside the noble gifts which, at the hand Of his illustrious spouse, Helen received; A golden spindle, and a basket wheel'd, Itself of silver, and its lip of gold. That basket Philo, her own handmaid, placed At beauteous Helen's side, charged to the brim With slender threads, on which the spindle lay With wool of purple lustre wrapp'd around. Approaching, on her foot-stool'd throne she sat, And, instant, of her royal spouse enquired. Know we, my Menelaus, dear to Jove! These guests of ours, and whence they have arrived? Erroneous I may speak, yet speak I must; In man or woman never have I seen Such likeness to another, (wonder-fixt I gaze,) as in this stranger to the son Of brave Ulysses, whom that Hero left New-born at home, when (shameless as I was) For my unworthy sake the Greecians sailed To Ilium, with fierce rage of battle fired. Then Menelaus, thus, the golden-hair'd. I also such resemblance find in him As thou; such feet, such hands, the cast ???????? ?? ?????. of eye Similar, and the head and flowing locks. And even now, when I Ulysses named, And his great sufferings mention'd, in my cause, The bitter tear dropp'd from his lids, while broad Before his eyes his purple cloak he spread. To whom the son of Nestor thus replied. Atrides! Menelaus! Chief renown'd! He is in truth his son, as thou hast said; But he is modest, and would much himself Condemn, if, at his first arrival here, He should loquacious seem and bold to thee, To whom we listen, captived by thy voice, As if some God had spoken. As for me, Nestor, my father, the Gerenian Chief Bade me conduct him hither, for he wish'd To see thee, promising himself from thee The benefit of some kind word or deed. For, destitute of other aid, he much His father's tedious absence mourns at home. So fares Telemachus; his father strays Remote, and in his stead, no friend hath he Who might avert the mischiefs that he feels. To whom the Hero amber-hair'd replied. Ye Gods! the offspring of indeed a friend Hath reach'd my house, of one who hath endured Arduous conflicts numerous for my sake; And much I purposed, had Olympian Jove Vouchsafed us prosperous passage o'er the Deep, To have received him with such friendship here As none beside. In Argos I had then Founded a city for him, and had raised A palace for himself; I would have brought The Hero hither, and his son, with all His people, and with all his wealth, some town Evacuating for his sake, of those Ruled by myself, and neighbouring close my own. Thus situate, we had often interchanged Sweet converse, nor had other cause at last Our friendship terminated or our joys, Than death's black cloud o'ershadowing him or me. But such delights could only envy move Even in the Gods, who have, of all the Greeks, Amerced him only of his wish'd return. So saying, he kindled the desire to weep In every bosom. Argive Helen wept Abundant, Jove's own daughter; wept as fast Telemachus and Menelaus both; Nor Nestor's son with tearless eyes remain'd, Calling to mind Antilochus Antilochus was his brother. by the son The son of Aurora, who slew Antilochus, was Memnon. Illustrious of the bright Aurora slain, Remembering whom, in accents wing'd he said. Atrides! ancient Nestor, when of late Conversing with him, we remember'd thee, Pronounced thee wise beyond all human-kind. Now therefore, let not even my advice Displease thee. It affords me no delight To intermingle tears with my repast, And soon, Aurora, daughter of the dawn, Will tinge the orient. Not that I account Due lamentation of a friend deceased Blameworthy, since, to sheer the locks and weep, Is all we can for the unhappy dead. I also have my grief, call'd to lament One, not the meanest of Achaia's sons, My brother; him I cannot but suppose To thee well-known, although unknown to me Who saw him never Because Pisistratus was born after Antilochus had sailed to Troy.; but report proclaims Antilochus superior to the most, In speed superior, and in feats of arms. To whom, the Hero of the yellow locks. O friend beloved! since nought which thou hast said Or recommended now, would have disgraced A man of years maturer far than thine, (For wise thy father is, and such art thou, And easy is it to discern the son Of such a father, whom Saturnian Jove In marriage both and at his birth ordain'd To great felicity; for he hath given To Nestor gradually to sink at home Into old age, and while he lives, to see His sons past others wise, and skill'd in arms,) The sorrow into which we sudden fell Shall pause. Come—now remember we the feast; Pour water on our hands, for we shall find (Telemachus and I) no dearth of themes For mutual converse when the day shall dawn. He ended; then, Asphalion, at his word, Servant of glorious Menelaus, pour'd Pure water on their hands, and they the feast Before them with keen appetite assail'd. But Jove-born Helen otherwise, meantime, Employ'd, into the wine of which they drank A drug infused, antidote to the pains Of grief and anger, a most potent charm For ills of every name. Whoe'er his wine So medicated drinks, he shall not pour All day the tears down his wan cheek, although His father and his mother both were dead, Nor even though his brother or his son Had fallen in battle, and before his eyes. Such drugs Jove's daughter own'd, with skill prepared, And of prime virtue, by the wife of Thone, Ægyptian Polydamna, given her. For Ægypt teems with drugs, yielding no few Which, mingled with the drink, are good, and many Of baneful juice, and enemies to life. There every man in skill medicinal Excels, for they are sons of Pæon all. That drug infused, she bade her servant pour The beverage forth, and thus her speech resumed. Atrides! Menelaus! dear to Jove! These also are the sons of Chiefs renown'd, (For Jove, as pleases him, to each assigns Or good or evil, whom all things obey,) Now therefore, feasting at your ease reclined, Listen with pleasure, for myself, the while, Will matter seasonable interpose. I cannot all rehearse, nor even name (Omitting none) the conflicts and exploits Of brave Ulysses; but with what address Successful, one atchievement he perform'd At Ilium, where Achaia's sons endured Such hardship, will I speak. Inflicting wounds Dishonourable on himself, he took A tatter'd garb, and like a serving-man Enter'd the spacious city of your foes. So veil'd, some mendicant he seem'd, although No Greecian less deserved that name than he. In such disguise he entered; all alike Misdeem'd him; me alone he not deceived Who challenged him, but, shrewd, he turn'd away. At length, however, when I had myself Bathed him, anointed, cloath'd him, and had sworn Not to declare him openly in Troy Till he should reach again the camp and fleet, He told me the whole purpose of the Greeks. Then, (many a Trojan slaughter'd,) he regain'd The camp, and much intelligence he bore To the Achaians. Oh, what wailing then Was heard of Trojan women! but my heart Exulted, alter'd now, and wishing home; For now my crime committed under force Of Venus' influence I deplored, what time She led me to a country far remote, A wanderer from the matrimonial bed, From my own child, and from my rightful Lord Alike unblemish'd both in form and mind. Her answer'd then the Hero golden-hair'd. Helen! thou hast well spoken. All is true. I have the talents fathom'd and the minds Of numerous Heroes, and have travell'd far, Yet never saw I with these eyes in man Such firmness as the calm Ulysses own'd; None such as in the wooden horse he proved, Where all our bravest sat, designing woe And bloody havoc for the sons of Troy. Thou thither camest, impell'd, as it should seem, By some divinity inclined to give Victory to our foes, and with thee came Godlike Deiphobus. Thrice round about The hollow ambush, striking with thy hand Its sides thou went'st, and by his name didst call Each prince of Greece, feigning his consort's voice. Myself with Diomede, and with divine Ulysses, seated in the midst, the call Heard plain and loud; we (Diomede and I) With ardour burn'd either to quit the horse So summon'd, or to answer from within. But, all impatient as we were, Ulysses Controul'd the rash design; so there the sons Of the Achaians silent sat and mute, And of us all Anticlus would alone Have answer'd; but Ulysses, with both hands Compressing close his lips, saved us, nor ceased Till Pallas thence conducted thee again. Then thus, discrete, Telemachus replied. Atrides! Menelaus! prince renown'd! Hard was his lot, whom these rare qualities Preserved not, neither had his dauntless heart Been iron, had he 'scaped his cruel doom. But haste, dismiss us hence, that on our beds Reposed, we may enjoy sleep, needful now. He ceased; then Argive Helen gave command To her attendant maidens to prepare Beds in the portico with purple rugs Resplendent, and with arras, overspread, And cover'd warm with cloaks of shaggy pile. Forth went the maidens, bearing each a torch, And spread the couches; next, the herald them Led forth, and in the vestibule the son Of Nestor and the youthful Hero slept, Telemachus; but in the interior house Atrides, with the loveliest of her sex Beside him, Helen of the sweeping stole. But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn, Glow'd in the East, then from his couch arose The warlike Menelaus, fresh attired; His faulchion o'er his shoulders slung, he bound His sandals fair to his unsullied feet, And like a God issuing, at the side Sat of Telemachus! to whom he spake. Hero! Telemachus! what urgent cause Hath hither led thee, to the land far-famed Of Lacedæmon o'er the spacious Deep? Public concern or private? Tell me true. To whom Telemachus discrete replied. Atrides! Menelaus! prince renown'd! News seeking of my Sire, I have arrived. My household is devour'd, my fruitful fields Are desolated, and my palace fill'd With enemies, who while they mutual wage Proud competition for my mother's love, My flocks continual slaughter, and my beeves. For this cause, at thy knees suppliant, I beg That thou wouldst tell me his disastrous end, If either thou beheld'st with thine own eyes His death, or from some wanderer of the Greeks Hast heard it; for no common woes, alas! Was he ordain'd to share even from the womb. Neither through pity or o'erstrain'd respect Flatter me, but explicit all relate Which thou hast witness'd. If my noble Sire E'er gratified thee by performance just Of word or deed at Ilium, where ye fell So numerous slain in fight, oh recollect Now his fidelity, and tell me true! Then Menelaus, sighing deep, replied. Gods! their ambition is to reach the bed Of a brave man, however base themselves. But as it chances, when the hart hath lay'd Her fawns new-yean'd and sucklings yet, to rest Within some dreadful lion's gloomy den, She roams the hills, and in the grassy vales Feeds heedless, till the lion, to his lair Return'd, destroys her and her little-ones, So them thy Sire shall terribly destroy. Jove, Pallas and Apollo! oh that such As erst in well-built Lesbos, where he strove With Philomelides, and threw him flat, A sight at which Achaia's sons rejoiced, Such, now, Ulysses might assail them all! Short life and bitter nuptials should be theirs. But thy enquiries neither indirect Will I evade, nor give thee false reply, But all that from the Ancient Proteus. of the Deep I have received will utter, hiding nought. As yet the Gods on Ægypt's shore detain'd Me wishing home, angry at my neglect To heap their altars with slain hecatombs: For they exacted from us evermore Strict reverence of their laws. There is an isle Amid the billowy flood, Pharos by name, In front of Ægypt, distant from her shore Far as a vessel by a sprightly gale Impell'd, may push her voyage in a day. The haven there is good, and many a ship Finds watering there from rivulets on the coast. There me the Gods kept twenty days, no breeze Propitious granting, that might sweep the waves, And usher to her home the flying bark. And now had our provision, all consumed, Left us exhausted, but a certain nymph Pitying saved me. Daughter fair was she Of mighty Proteus, Ancient of the Deep, Idothea named; her most my sorrows moved; She found me from my followers all apart Wandering, (for they around the isle, with hooks The fishes snaring roam'd, by famine urged,) And standing at my side, me thus bespake. Stranger! thou must be ideot born, or weak At least in intellect, or thy delight Is in distress and misery, who delay'st To leave this island, and no egress hence Canst find, although thy famish'd people faint. So spake the Goddess, and I thus replied. I tell thee, whosoever of the Powers Divine thou art, that I am prison'd here Not willingly, but must have, doubtless, sinn'd Against the deathless tenants of the skies. Yet say (for the Immortals all things know,) What God detains me, and my course forbids Hence to my country o'er the fishy Deep? So I; to whom the Goddess all divine. Stranger! I will inform thee true. A seer Oracular, the Ancient of the Deep, Immortal Proteus, the Ægyptian, haunts These shores, familiar with all Ocean's gulfs, And Neptune's subject. He is by report My father; him if thou art able once To seize and bind, he will prescribe the course With all its measured distances, by which Thou shalt regain secure thy native shores. He will, moreover, at thy suit declare, Thou favour'd of the skies! what good, what ill Hath in thine house befallen, while absent thou Thy voyage difficult perform'st and long. She spake, and I replied,—Thyself reveal By what effectual bands I may secure The ancient Deity marine, lest, warn'd Of my approach, he shun me and escape. Hard task for mortal hands to bind a God! Then thus Idothea answer'd all-divine. I will inform thee true. Soon as the sun Hath climb'd the middle heavens, the prophet old, Emerging while the breezy zephyr blows, And cover'd with the scum of ocean, seeks His spacious cove, in which outstretch'd he lies. The phocæ Seals, or sea-calves. also, rising from the waves, Offspring of beauteous Halosydna, sleep Around him, numerous, and the fishy scent Exhaling rank of the unfathom'd flood. Thither conducting thee at peep of day I will dispose thee in some safe recess, But from among thy followers thou shalt chuse The bravest three in all thy gallant fleet. And now the artifices understand Of the old prophet of the sea. The sum Of all his phocæ numbering duly first, He will pass through them, and when all by fives He counted hath, will in the midst repose Content, as sleeps the shepherd with his flock. When ye shall see him stretch'd, then call to mind That moment all your prowess, and prevent, Howe'er he strive impatient, his escape. All changes trying, he will take the form Of every reptile on the earth, will seem A river now, and now devouring fire; But hold him ye, and grasp him still the more. And when himself shall question you, restored To his own form in which ye found him first Reposing, then from farther force abstain; Then, Hero! loose the Ancient of the Deep, And ask him, of the Gods who checks thy course Hence to thy country o'er the fishy flood. So saying, she plunged into the billowy waste. I then, in various musings lost, my ships Along the sea-beach station'd sought again, And when I reach'd my galley on the shore We supp'd, and sacred night falling from heaven, Slept all extended on the ocean-side. But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn, Look'd rosy forth, pensive beside the shore I walk'd of Ocean, frequent to the Gods Praying devout, then chose the fittest three For bold assault, and worthiest of my trust. Meantime the Goddess from the bosom wide Of Ocean rising, brought us thence four skins Of phocæ, and all newly-stript, a snare Contriving subtle to deceive her Sire. Four cradles in the sand she scoop'd, then sat Expecting us, who in due time approach'd; She lodged us side by side, and over each A raw skin cast. Horrible to ourselves Proved that disguise, whom the pernicious scent Of the sea-nourish'd phocæ sore annoy'd; For who would lay him down at a whale's side? But she a potent remedy devised Herself to save us, who the nostrils soothed Of each with pure ambrosia thither brought Odorous, which the fishy scent subdued. All morning, patient watchers, there we lay; And now the numerous phocæ from the Deep Emerging, slept along the shore, and he At noon came also, and perceiving there His fatted monsters, through the flock his course Took regular, and summ'd them; with the first He number'd us, suspicion none of fraud Conceiving, then couch'd also. We, at once, Loud-shouting flew on him, and in our arms Constrain'd him fast; nor the sea-prophet old Call'd not incontinent his shifts to mind. First he became a long-maned lion grim, Then dragon, panther then, a savage boar, A limpid stream, and an o'ershadowing tree. We persevering held him, till at length The Ancient of the Deep, skill'd as he is In wiles, yet weary, question'd me, and said. Oh Atreus' son, by what confederate God Instructed liest thou in wait for me, To seize and hold me? what is thy desire? So He; to whom thus answer I return'd. Old Seer! thou know'st; why, fraudful, should'st thou ask? It is because I have been prison'd long Within this isle, whence I have sought in vain Deliverance, till my wonted courage fails. Yet say (for the Immortals all things know,) What God detains me, and my course forbids Hence to my country o'er the fishy Deep? So I; when thus the old one of the waves. From the abruptness of this beginning, Virgil, probably, who has copied the story, took the hint of his admired exordium. Nam quis te, juvenum confidentissime, nostras Egit adire domos?But thy plain duty was to have adored Jove, first, in sacrifice, and all the Gods, That then embarking, by propitious gales Impell'd, thou might'st have reach'd thy country soon. For thou art doom'd ne'er to behold again Thy friends, thy palace, or thy native shores, Till thou have seen once more the hallow'd flood Of Ægypt, and with hecatombs adored Devout the deathless tenants of the skies. Then will they speed thee whither thou desirest. He ended, and my heart broke at his words, Which bade me pass again the gloomy gulf To Ægypt; tedious course, and hard to atchieve! Yet, though in sorrow whelm'd, I thus replied. Old prophet! I will all thy will perform. But tell me, and the truth simply reveal; Have the Achaians with their ships arrived All safe, whom Nestor left and I, at Troy? Or of the Chiefs have any in their barks, Or in their followers' arms found a dire death Unlook'd for, since that city's siege we closed? I spake, when answer thus the God return'd. Atrides, why these questions? need is none That thou should'st all my secrets learn, which once Reveal'd, thou wouldst not long dry-eyed remain. Of those no few have died, and many live; But leaders, two alone, in their return Have died, (thou also hast had war to wage,) And one, still living, roams the boundless sea. Ajax Son of Oïleus., surrounded by his galleys, died. Him Neptune, first, against the bulky rocks The Gyræ drove, but saved him from the Deep; Nor had he perish'd, hated as he was By Pallas, but for his own impious boast In frenzy utter'd, that he would escape The billows, even in the Gods' despight. Neptune that speech vain-glorious hearing, grasp'd His trident, and the huge Gyræan rock Smiting indignant, dash'd it half away; Part stood, and part, on which the boaster sat When, first, the brainsick fury seized him, fell, Bearing him with it down into the gulfs Of Ocean, where he drank the brine, and died. But thy own brother in his barks escaped That fate, by Juno saved; yet when, at length, He should have gain'd Malea's craggy shore, Then, by a sudden tempest caught, he flew With many a groan far o'er the fishy Deep To the land's utmost point, where once his home Thyestes had, but where Thyestes' son Dwelt then, Ægisthus. Easy lay his course And open thence, and as it pleased the Gods, The shifted wind soon bore them to their home. He high in exultation, trod the shore That gave him birth, kiss'd it, and at the sight, The welcome sight of Greece, shed many a tear. Yet not unseen he landed; for a spy, One whom the shrewd Ægisthus had seduced By promise of two golden talents, mark'd His coming from a rock where he had watch'd The year complete, lest passing unperceived, The King should reassert his right in arms. Swift flew the spy with tidings to his Lord, And He, incontinent, this project framed Insidious. Twenty men, the boldest hearts Of all the people, from the rest he chose, Whom he in ambush placed, and others charged Diligent to prepare the festal board. With horses, then, and chariots forth he drove Full-fraught with mischief, and conducting home The unsuspicious King, amid the feast Slew him, as at his crib men slay an ox. Nor of thy brother's train, nor of his train Who slew thy brother, one survived, but all, Weltering in blood together, there expired. He ended, and his words beat on my heart As they would break it. On the sands I sat Weeping, nor life nor light desiring more. But when I had in dust roll'd me, and wept To full satiety, mine ear again The oracle of Ocean thus address'd. Sit not, O son of Atreus! weeping here Longer, for remedy can none be found; But quick arising, trial make, how best Thou shalt, and soonest, reach thy home again. For either him still living thou shalt find, Or ere thou come, Orestes shall have slain The traitor, and thine eyes shall see his tomb. He ceased, and I, afflicted as I was, Yet felt my spirit at that word refresh'd, And in wing'd accents answer thus return'd. Of these I am inform'd; but name the third Who dead or living, on the boundless Deep Is still detain'd; I dread, yet wish to hear. So I; to whom thus Proteus in return. Laertes' son, the Lord of Ithaca— Him in an island weeping I beheld, Guest of the nymph Calypso, by constraint Her guest, and from his native land withheld By sad necessity; for ships well-oar'd, Or faithful followers hath he none, whose aid Might speed him safely o'er the spacious flood. But, Menelaus dear to Jove! thy fate Ordains not thee the stroke of death to meet In steed-famed Argos, but far hence the Gods Will send thee to Elysium, and the earth's Extremest bounds; (there Rhadamanthus dwells, The golden-hair'd, and there the human kind Enjoy the easiest life; no snow is there, No biting winter, and no drenching shower, But zephyr always gently from the sea Breathes on them, to refresh the happy race;) For that fair Helen is by nuptial bands Thy own, and thou art son-in-law of Jove. So saying, he plunged into the billowy waste. I then, with my brave comrades to the fleet Return'd, deep-musing as I went, and sad. No sooner had I reach'd my ship beside The ocean, and we all had supped, than night From heaven fell on us, and at ease reposed Along the margin of the sea, we slept. But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn, Look'd rosy forth, drawing our galleys down Into the sacred Deep, we rear'd again The mast, unfurl'd the sail, and to our seats On board returning, thresh'd the foamy flood. Once more, at length, within the hallow'd stream Of Ægypt mooring, on the shore I slew Whole hecatombs, and (the displeasure thus Of the Immortal Gods appeased,) I rear'd To Agamemnon's never-dying fame A tomb, and finishing it sail'd again With such a gale from heaven vouchsafed, as sent My ships swift scudding to the shores of Greece. But come—eleven days wait here or twelve A guest with me, when I will send thee hence Nobly and honour'd with illustrious gifts, With polish'd chariot, with three princely steeds, And with a gorgeous cup, that to the Gods Libation pouring ever while thou livest From that same cup, thou may'st remember me. Him, prudent, then answered Telemachus. Atrides seek not to detain me here Long time; for though contented I could sit The year beside thee, nor regret my home Or parents, (so delightful thy discourse Sounds in my ear,) yet, even now, I know, That my attendants to the Pylian shore Wish my return, whom thou thus long detain'st. What boon soe'er thou givest me, be it such As I may treasured keep; but horses none Take I to Ithaca; them rather far Keep thou, for thy own glory. Thou art Lord Of an extended plain, where copious springs The lotus, herbage of all savours, wheat, Pulse, and white barley of luxuriant growth. But Ithaca no level champaign owns, A nursery of goats, and yet a land Fairer than even pastures to the eye. No sea-encircled isle of ours affords Smooth course commodious, and expanse of meads, But my own Ithaca transcends them all! He said; the Hero Menelaus smiled, And stroaking tenderly his cheek, replied. Dear youth! thy speech proclaims thy noble blood. I can with ease supply thee from within With what shall suit thee better, and the gift Of all that I possess which most excels In beauty, and the noblest shall be thine. I give thee, wrought elaborate, a cup Itself all silver, bound with lip of gold. It is the work of Vulcan, which to me The Hero Phædimus imparted, King Of the Sidonians, when on my return His house received me. That shall be thy own. Thus they conferr'd; and now the busy train Of ????????—generally signifies the founder of a feast; but we are taught by Eustathius to understand by it, in this place, the persons employed in preparing it. menials culinary at the gate Enter'd of Menelaus, Chief renown'd; They brought him sheep, with heart-ennobling wine, While all their wives, their brows with frontlets bound, Came charged with bread. Thus busy they prepared A banquet in the mansion of the King. Meantime, before Ulysses' palace gate The suitors sported with the quoit and spear On the smooth area, customary scene Of all their strife and angry clamour loud. There sat Antinoüs, and the godlike youth Eurymachus, superior to the rest And Chiefs among them, to whom Phronius' son Noëmon drawing nigh, with anxious mien Question'd Antinoüs, and thus began. Know we, Antinoüs! or know we not, When to expect Telemachus at home Again from Pylus? In my ship he went, Which now I need, that I may cross the sea To Elis, on whose spacious plain I feed Twelve mares, each suckling a mule-colt as yet Unbroken, but of which I purpose one To ferry thence, and break him into use. He spake, whom they astonish'd heard; for him They deem'd not to Nelëian Pylus gone, But haply into his own fields, his flocks To visit, or the steward of his swine. Then thus, Eupithes' son, Antinoüs, spake. Say true. When sail'd he forth? of all our youth, Whom chose he for his followers? his own train Of slaves and hirelings? hath he power to effect This also? Tell me too, for I would learn— Took he perforce thy sable bark away, Or gavest it to him at his first demand? To whom Noëmon, Phronius' son, replied. I gave it voluntary; what could'st thou, Should such a prince petition for thy bark In such distress? Hard were it to refuse. Brave youths (our bravest youths except yourselves,) Attend him forth; and with them I observed Mentor embarking, ruler o'er them all, Or, if not him, a God; for such he seem'd. But this much moves my wonder. Yester-morn I saw, at day-break, noble Mentor here, Whom shipp'd for Pylus I had seen before. He ceased; and to his father's house return'd; They, hearing, sat aghast. Their games meantime Finish'd, the suitors on their seats reposed, To whom Eupithes' son, Antinoüs, next, Much troubled spake; a black storm overcharged His bosom, and his vivid eyes flash'd fire. Ye Gods, a proud exploit is here atchieved, This voyage of Telemachus, by us Pronounced impracticable; yet the boy In downright opposition to us all, Hath headlong launch'd a ship, and with a band Selected from our bravest youth, is gone. He soon will prove more mischievous, whose power Jove wither, ere we suffer its effects! But give me a swift bark with twenty rowers, That, watching his return within the streights Of rocky Samos and of Ithaca, I may surprise him; so shall he have sail'd To seek his sire, fatally for himself. He ceased, and loud applause heard in reply, With warm encouragement. Then, rising all, Into Ulysses' house at once they throng'd. Nor was Penelope left uninform'd Long time of their clandestine plottings deep, For herald Medon told her all, whose ear Their councils caught while in the outer-court He stood, and they that project framed within. Swift to Penelope the tale he bore, Who as he pass'd the gate him thus address'd. For what cause, herald! have the suitors sent Thee foremost? Would they that my maidens lay Their tasks aside, and dress the board for them? Here end their wooing! may they hence depart Never, and may the banquet now prepared, This banquet prove your This transition from the third to the second person belongs to the original, and is considered as a fine stroke of art in the poet, who represents Penelope in the warmth of her resentment, forgetting where she is, and addressing the suitors as if present. last! who in such throngs Here meeting waste the patrimony fair Of brave Telemachus; ye never, sure, When children, heard how gracious and how good Ulysses dwelt among your parents, none Of all his people, or in word or deed Injuring as great princes oft are wont, By favour influenced now, now by disgust. He no man wrong'd at any time; but plain Your wicked purpose in your deeds appears, Who sense have none of benefits conferr'd. Then Medon answer thus, prudent, return'd. Oh Queen! may the Gods grant this prove the worst. But greater far and heavier ills than this The suitors plan, whose counsels Jove confound! Their base desire and purpose are to slay Telemachus on his return; for he, To gather tidings of his Sire is gone To Pylus, or to Sparta's land divine. He said; and where she stood, her trembling knees Fail'd under her, and all her spirits went. Speechless she long remain'd, tears fill'd her eyes, And inarticulate in its passage died Her utterance, till at last with pain she spake. Herald! why went my son? he hath no need On board swift ships to ride, which are to man His steeds that bear him over seas remote. Went he, that, with himself, his very name Might perish from among mankind for ever? Then answer, thus, Medon the wise return'd. I know not whether him some God impell'd Or his own heart to Pylus, there to hear News of his Sire's return, or by what fate At least he died, if he return no more. He said, and traversing Ulysses' courts, Departed; she, with heart-consuming woe O'erwhelm'd, no longer could endure to take Repose on any of her numerous seats, But on the threshold of her chamber-door Lamenting sat, while all her female train Around her moan'd, the antient and the young, Whom, sobbing, thus, Penelope bespake. Hear me, ye maidens! for of women born Coeval with me, none hath e'er received Such plenteous sorrow from the Gods as I, Who first my noble husband lost, endued With courage lion-like, of all the Greeks The Chief with every virtue most adorn'd, A prince all-excellent, whose glorious praise Through Hellas and all Argos flew diffused. And now, my darling son,—him storms have snatch'd Far hence inglorious, and I knew it not. Ah treacherous servants! conscious as ye were Of his design, not one of you the thought Conceived to wake me when he went on board. For had but the report once reach'd my ear, He either had not gone (how much soe'er He wish'd to leave me,) or had left me dead. But haste ye,—bid my ancient servant come, Dolion (whom when I left my father's house He gave me, and whose office is to attend My numerous garden-plants,) that he may seek At once Laertes, and may tell him all, Who may contrive some remedy, perchance, Or fit expedient, and shall come abroad To weep before the men who wish to slay Even the prince, godlike Ulysses' son. Then thus the gentle Euryclea spake, Nurse of Telemachus. Alas! my Queen! Slay me, or spare, deal with me as thou wilt, I will confess the truth. I knew it all. I gave him all that he required from me, Both wine and bread, and at his bidding, swore To tell thee nought in twelve whole days to come, Or till, enquiry made, thou should'st thyself Learn his departure, lest thou should'st impair Thy lovely features with excess of grief. But lave thyself, and fresh attired, ascend To thy own chamber, there, with all thy train, To worship Pallas, who shall save, thenceforth, Thy son from death, what ills soe'er he meet. Add not fresh sorrows to the present woes Of the old King, for I believe not yet Arcesias' race entirely by the Gods Renounced, but trust that there shall still be found Among them, who shall dwell in royal state, And reap the fruits of fertile fields remote. So saying, she hush'd her sorrow, and her eyes No longer stream'd. Then, bathed and fresh attired, Penelope ascended with her train The upper palace, and a basket stored With hallow'd cakes offering, to Pallas pray'd. Hear, matchless daughter of Jove ægis-arm'd! If ever wise Ulysses offer'd here The thighs of fatted kine or sheep to thee, Now mindful of his piety, preserve His darling son, and frustrate with a frown The cruelty of these imperious guests! She said, and wept aloud, whose earnest suit Pallas received. And now the spacious hall And gloomy passages with tumult rang And clamour of that throng, when thus, a youth Insolent as his fellows, dared to speak. Much woo'd and long, the Queen at length prepares To choose another mate Mistaking, perhaps, the sound of her voice and imagining that she sang. —Vide Barnes in loco., and nought suspects The bloody death to which her son is doom'd. So he; but they, meantime, themselves remain'd Untaught, what course the dread concern elsewhere Had taken, whom Antinoüs thus address'd. Sirs! one and all, I counsel you, beware Of such bold boasting unadvised; lest one O'erhearing you, report your words within. No-rather thus, in silence, let us move To an exploit so pleasant to us all. He said, and twenty chose, the bravest there, With whom he sought the galley on the shore, Which drawing down into the Deep, they placed The mast and sails on board, and fitting, next, Each oar in order to its proper groove, Unfurl'd and spread their canvas to the gale. Their bold attendants, then, brought them their arms, And soon as in deep water they had moor'd The ship, themselves embarking, supp'd on board, And watch'd impatient for the dusk of eve. But when Penelope, the palace stairs Remounting, had her upper chamber reach'd, There, unrefresh'd with either food or wine, She lay'd her down, her noble son the theme Of all her thoughts, whether he should escape His haughty foes, or perish by their hands. Numerous as are the lion's thoughts, who sees, Not without fear, a multitude with toils Encircling him around, such numerous thoughts Her bosom occupied, till sleep at length Invading her, she sank in soft repose. Then Pallas, teeming with a new design, Set forth an airy phantom in the form Of fair Iphthima, daughter of the brave Icarius, and Eumelus' wedded wife In Pheræ. Shaped like her the dream she sent Into the mansion of the godlike Chief Ulysses, with kind purpose to abate The sighs and tears of sad Penelope. Entering the chamber-portal, where the bolt Secured it, at her head the image stood, And thus, in terms compassionate, began. Sleep'st thou, distress'd Penelope? The Gods, Happy in everlasting rest themselves, Forbid thy sorrows. Thou shalt yet behold Thy son again, who hath by no offence Incurr'd at any time the wrath of heaven. To whom, sweet-slumbering in the shadowy gate By which dreams pass, Penelope replied. What cause, my sister, brings thee, who art seen Unfrequent here, for that thou dwell'st remote? And thou enjoin'st me a cessation too From sorrows numerous, and which, fretting, wear My heart continual; first, my spouse I lost With courage lion-like endow'd, a prince All-excellent, whose never-dying praise Through Hellas and all Argos flew diffused; And now my only son, new to the toils And hazards of the sea, nor less untaught The arts of traffic, in a ship is gone Far hence, for whose dear cause I sorrow more Than for his Sire himself, and even shake With terror, lest he perish by their hands To whom he goes, or in the stormy Deep; For numerous are his foes, and all intent To slay him, ere he reach his home again. Then answer thus the shadowy form return'd. Take courage; suffer not excessive dread To overwhelm thee, such a guide he hath And guardian, one whom many wish their friend, And ever at their side, knowing her power, Minerva; she compassionates thy griefs, And I am here, her harbinger, who speak As thou hast heard by her own kind command. Then thus Penelope the wise replied. Oh! if thou art a Goddess, and hast heard A Goddess' voice, rehearse to me the lot Of that unhappy one, if yet he live Spectator of the cheerful beams of day, Or if, already dead, he dwell below. Whom answer'd thus the fleeting shadow vain. I will not now inform thee if thy Lord Live, or live not. Vain words are best unspoken. So saying, her egress swift beside the bolt She made, and melted into air. Upsprang From sleep Icarius' daughter, and her heart Felt heal'd within her, by that dream distinct Visited in the noiseless night serene. Meantime the suitors urged their watery way, To instant death devoting in their hearts Telemachus. There is a rocky isle In the mid sea, Samos the rude between And Ithaca, not large, named Asteris. It hath commodious havens, into which A passage clear opens on either side, And there the ambush'd Greeks his coming watch'd. BOOK V. ARGUMENT OF THE FIFTH BOOK. Mercury bears to Calypso a command from Jupiter that she dismiss Ulysses. She, after some remonstrances, promises obedience and furnishes him with implements and materials, with which he constructs a raft. He quits Calypso's island; is persecuted by Neptune with dreadful tempests, but by the assistance of a sea nymph, after having lost his raft, is enabled to swim to Phæacia. Aurora from beside her glorious mate Tithonus now arose, light to dispense Through earth and heaven, when the assembled Gods In council sat, o'er whom high-thundering Jove Presided, mightiest of the Powers above. Amid them, Pallas on the numerous woes Descanted of Ulysses, whom she saw With grief, still prison'd in Calypso's isle. Jove, Father, hear me, and ye other Powers Who live for ever, hear! Be never King Henceforth to gracious acts inclined, humane, Or righteous, but let every sceptred hand Rule merciless, and deal in wrong alone, Since none of all his people whom he sway'd With such paternal gentleness and love Remembers, now, divine Ulysses more. He, in yon distant isle a sufferer lies Of hopeless sorrow, through constraint the guest Still of the nymph Calypso, without means Or power to reach his native shores again, Alike of gallant barks and friends deprived, Who might conduct him o'er the spacious Deep. Nor this is all, but enemies combine To slay his son ere yet he can return From Pylus, whither he hath gone to learn There, or in Sparta, tidings of his Sire. To whom the cloud-assembler God replied. What word hath pass'd thy lips, daughter beloved? Hast thou not purposed that arriving soon At home, Ulysses shall destroy his foes? Guide thou, Telemachus, (for well thou canst,) That he may reach secure his native coast, And that the suitors baffled may return. He ceased, and thus to Hermes spake, his son. Hermes! (for thou art herald of our will At all times,) to yon bright-hair'd nymph convey Our fixt resolve, that brave Ulysses thence Depart, uncompanied by God or man. Borne on a corded raft, and suffering woe Extreme, he on the twentieth day shall reach, Not sooner, Scherie the deep-soil'd, possess'd By the Phæacians, kinsmen of the Gods. They, as a God shall reverence the Chief, And in a bark of theirs shall send him thence To his own home, much treasure, brass and gold And raiment giving him, to an amount Surpassing all that, had he safe return'd, He should by lot have shared of Ilium's spoil. Thus fate appoints Ulysses to regain His country, his own palace, and his friends. He ended, nor the Argicide refused, Messenger of the skies; his sandals fair, Ambrosial, golden, to his feet he bound, Which o'er the moist wave, rapid as the wind, Bear him, and o'er the illimitable earth, Then took his rod with which, at will, all eyes He closes soft, or opes them wide again. So arm'd, forth flew the valiant Argicide. Alighting on Pieria, down he stoop'd To Ocean, and the billows lightly skimm'd In form a sea-mew, such as in the bays Tremendous of the barren Deep her food Seeking, dips oft in brine her ample wing. In such disguise o'er many a wave he rode, But reaching, now, that isle remote, forsook The azure Deep, and at the spacious grot, Where dwelt the amber-tressed nymph arrived, Found her within. A fire on all the hearth Blazed sprightly, and, afar-diffused, the scent Of smooth-split cedar and of cypress wood Odorous, burning, cheer'd the happy isle. She, busied at the loom, and plying fast Her golden shuttle, with melodious voice Sat chaunting there; a grove on either side, Alder and poplar, and the redolent branch Wide-spread of Cypress, skirted dark the cave. There many a bird of broadest pinion built Secure her nest, the owl, the kite, and daw Long-tongued, frequenter of the sandy shores. A garden-vine luxuriant on all sides Mantled the spacious cavern, cluster-hung Profuse; four fountains of serenest lymph Their sinuous course pursuing side by side, Stray'd all around, and every where appear'd Meadows of softest verdure, purpled o'er With violets; it was a scene to fill A God from heaven with wonder and delight. Hermes, Heaven's messenger, admiring stood That sight, and having all survey'd, at length Enter'd the grotto; nor the lovely nymph Him knew not soon as seen, for not unknown Each to the other the Immortals are, How far soever separate their abodes. Yet found he not within the mighty Chief Ulysses; he sat weeping on the shore, Forlorn, for there his custom was with groans Of sad regret to afflict his breaking heart, Looking continual o'er the barren Deep. Then thus Calypso, nymph divine, the God Question'd, from her resplendent throne august. Hermes! possessor of the potent rod! Who, though by me much reverenced and beloved, So seldom comest, say, wherefore comest now? Speak thy desire; I grant it, if thou ask Things possible, and possible to me. Stay not, but entering farther, at my board Due rites of hospitality receive. So saying, the Goddess with ambrosial food Her table cover'd, and with rosy juice Nectareous charged the cup. Then ate and drank The Argicide and herald of the skies, And in his soul with that repast divine Refresh'd, his message to the nymph declared. Questionest thou, a Goddess, me a God? I tell thee truth, since such is thy demand. Not willing, but by Jove constrain'd, I come. For who would, voluntary, such a breadth Enormous measure of the salt expanse, Where city none is seen in which the Gods Are served with chosen hecatombs and prayer? But no divinity may the designs Elude, or contravert, of Jove supreme. He saith, that here thou hold'st the most distrest Of all those warriors who nine years assail'd The city of Priam, and, (that city sack'd,) Departed in the tenth; but, going thence, Offended Pallas, who with adverse winds Opposed their voyage, and with boisterous waves. Then perish'd all his gallant friends, but him Billows and storms drove hither; Jove commands That thou dismiss him hence without delay, For fate ordains him not to perish here From all his friends remote, but he is doom'd To see them yet again, and to arrive At his own palace in his native land. He said; divine Calypso at the sound Shudder'd, and in wing'd accents thus replied. Ye are unjust, ye Gods, and envious past All others, grudging if a Goddess take A mortal man openly to her arms! So, when the rosy-finger'd Morning chose Orion, though ye live yourselves at ease, Yet ye all envied her, until the chaste Diana from her golden throne dispatch'd A silent shaft, which slew him in Ortygia. So, when the golden-tressed Ceres, urged By passion, took Iäsion to her arms In a thrice-labour'd fallow, not untaught Was Jove that secret long, and hearing it, Indignant, slew him with his candent bolt. So also, O ye Gods, ye envy me The mortal man, my consort. Him I saved Myself, while solitary on his keel He rode, for with his sulphurous arrow Jove Had cleft his bark amid the sable Deep. Then perish'd all his gallant friends, but him Billows and storms drove hither, whom I loved Sincere, and fondly destined to a life Immortal, unobnoxious to decay. But since no Deity may the designs Elude or controvert of Jove supreme, Hence with him o'er the barren Deep, if such The Sovereign's will, and such his stern command. But undismiss'd he goes by me, who ships Myself well-oar'd and mariners have none To send with him athwart the spacious flood; Yet freely, readily, my best advice I will afford him, that, escaping all Danger, he may regain his native shore. Then Hermes thus, the messenger of heaven. Act as thou say'st, fearing the frown of Jove, Lest, if provoked, he spare not even thee. So saying, the dauntless Argicide withdrew, And she (Jove's mandate heard) all-graceful went, Seeking the brave Ulysses; on the shore She found him seated; tears succeeding tears Deluged his eyes, while, hopeless of return, Life's precious hours to eating cares he gave Continual, with the nymph now charm'd no more. Yet, cold as she was amorous, still he pass'd His nights beside her in the hollow grot, Constrain'd, and day by day the rocks among Which lined the shore heart-broken sat, and oft While wistfully he eyed the barren Deep, Wept, groan'd, desponded, sigh'd, and wept again. Then, drawing near, thus spake the nymph divine. Unhappy! weep not here, nor life consume In anguish; go; thou hast my glad consent. Arise to labour; hewing down the trunks Of lofty trees, fashion them with the axe To a broad raft, which closely floor'd above, Shall hence convey thee o'er the gloomy Deep. Bread, water, and the red grape's cheering juice Myself will put on board, which shall preserve Thy life from famine; I will also give New raiment for thy limbs, and will dispatch Winds after thee to waft thee home unharm'd, If such the pleasure of the Gods who dwell In yonder boundless heaven, superior far To me, in knowledge and in skill to judge. She ceased; but horror at that sound the heart Chill'd of Ulysses, and in accents wing'd With wonder, thus the noble Chief replied. Ah! other thoughts than of my safe return Employ thee, Goddess, now, who bid'st me pass The perilous gulf of Ocean on a raft, That wild expanse terrible, which even ships Pass not, though form'd to cleave their way with ease, And joyful in propitious winds from Jove. No,—let me never, in despite of thee, Embark on board a raft, nor till thou swear, Oh Goddess! the inviolable oath, That future mischief thou intend'st me none. He said; Calypso, beauteous Goddess, smiled, And, while she spake, stroking his cheek, replied. Thou dost asperse me rudely, and excuse Of ignorance hast none, far better taught; What words were these? How could'st thou thus reply? Now hear me, Earth, and the wide Heaven above! Hear, too, ye waters of the Stygian stream Under the earth, (by which the blessed Gods Swear trembling, and revere the aweful oath!) That future mischief I intend thee none. No, my designs concerning thee are such As, in an exigence resembling thine, Myself, most sure, should for myself conceive. I have a mind more equal, not of steel My heart is form'd, but much to pity inclined. So saying, the lovely Goddess with swift pace Led on, whose footsteps he as swift pursued. Within the vaulted cavern they arrived, The Goddess and the man; on the same throne Ulysses sat, whence Hermes had arisen, And viands of all kinds, such as sustain The life of mortal man, Calypso placed Before him, both for beverage and for food. She opposite to the illustrious Chief Reposed, by her attendant maidens served With nectar and ambrosia. They their hands Stretch'd forth together to the ready feast, And when nor hunger more nor thirst remain'd Unsated, thus the beauteous nymph began. Laertes' noble son, for wisdom famed And artifice! oh canst thou thus resolve To seek, incontinent, thy native shores? I pardon thee. Farewell! but could'st thou guess The woes which fate ordains thee to endure Ere yet thou reach thy country, well-content Here to inhabit, thou would'st keep my grot And be immortal, howsoe'er thy wife Engage thy every wish day after day. Yet can I not in stature or in form Myself suspect inferior aught to her, Since competition cannot be between Mere mortal beauties, and a form divine. To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied. Aweful Divinity! be not incensed. I know that my Penelope in form And stature altogether yields to thee, For she is mortal, and immortal thou, From age exempt; yet not the less I wish My home, and languish daily to return. But should some God amid the sable Deep Dash me again into a wreck, my soul Shall bear that also; for, by practice taught, I have learn'd patience, having much endured By tempest and in battle both. Come then This evil also! I am well prepared. He ended, and the sun sinking, resign'd The earth to darkness. Then in a recess Interior of the cavern, side by side Reposed, they took their amorous delight. But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn, Look'd rosy forth, Ulysses then in haste Put on his vest and mantle, and the nymph Her snowy vesture of transparent woof, Graceful, redundant; to her waist she bound Her golden zone, and veil'd her beauteous head, Then, musing, plann'd the noble Chief's return. She gave him, fitted to the grasp, an axe Of iron, ponderous, double edged, with haft Of olive-wood, inserted firm, and wrought With curious art. Then, placing in his hand A polish'd adze, she led, herself, the way To her isle's utmost verge, where tallest trees But dry long since and sapless stood, which best Might serve his purposes, as buoyant most, The alder, poplar, and cloud-piercing fir. To that tall grove she led and left him there, Seeking her grot again. Then slept not He, But, swinging with both hands the axe, his task Soon finish'd; trees full twenty to the ground He cast, which, dexterous, with his adze he smooth'd, The knotted surface chipping by a line. Meantime the lovely Goddess to his aid Sharp augers brought, with which he bored the beams, Then, side by side placing them, fitted each To other, and with long cramps join'd them all. Broad as an artist, skill'd in naval works, The bottom of a ship of burthen spreads, Such breadth Ulysses to his raft assign'd. He deck'd her over with long planks, upborne On massy beams; He made the mast, to which He added suitable the yard;—he framed Rudder and helm to regulate her course, With wicker-work he border'd all her length For safety, and much ballast stow'd within. Meantime, Calypso brought him for a sail Fittest materials, which he also shaped, And to his sail due furniture annex'd Of cordage strong, foot-ropes and ropes aloft, Then heaved her down with levers to the Deep. He finish'd all his work on the fourth day, And on the fifth, Calypso, nymph divine, Dismiss'd him from her isle, but laved him first, And cloath'd him in sweet-scented garments new. Two skins the Goddess also placed on board, One charged with crimson wine, and ampler one With water, nor a bag with food replete Forgot, nutritious, grateful to the taste, Nor yet, her latest gift, a gentle gale And manageable, which Ulysses spread, Exulting, all his canvas to receive. Beside the helm he sat, steering expert, Nor sleep fell ever on his eyes that watch'd Intent the Pleiads, tardy in decline Bootes, and the Bear, call'd else the Wain, Which, in his polar prison circling, looks Direct toward Orion, and alone Of these sinks never to the briny Deep. That star the lovely Goddess bade him hold Continual on his left through all his course. Ten days and seven, he, navigating, cleaved The brine, and on the eighteenth day, at length, The shadowy mountains of Phæacia's land Descried, where nearest to his course it lay Like a broad buckler on the waves afloat. But Neptune, now returning from the land Of Æthiopia, mark'd him on his raft Skimming the billows, from the mountain-tops Of distant Solyma The Solymi were the ancient inhabitants of Pisidia in Asia Minor.. With tenfold wrath Inflamed that sight he view'd, his brows he shook, And thus within himself, indignant, spake. So then—new counsels in the skies, it seems, Propitious to Ulysses, have prevail'd Since Æthiopia hath been my abode. He sees Phæacia nigh, where he must leap The boundary of his woes; but ere that hour Arrive, I will ensure him many a groan. So saying, he grasp'd his trident, gather'd dense The clouds and troubled ocean; every storm From every point he summon'd, earth and sea Darkening, and the night fell black from heaven. The East, the South, the heavy-blowing West, And the cold North-wind clear, assail'd at once His raft, and heaved on high the billowy flood. All hope, all courage, in that moment, lost, The Hero thus within himself complain'd. Wretch that I am, what destiny at last Attends me! much I fear the Goddess' words All true, which threaten'd me with numerous ills On the wide sea, ere I should reach my home. Behold them all fulfill'd! With what a storm Jove hangs the heavens, and agitates the Deep! The winds combined beat on me. Now I sink! Thrice blest, and more than thrice, Achaia's sons At Ilium slain for the Atridæ' sake! Ah, would to heaven that, dying, I had felt That day the stroke of fate, when me the dead Achilles guarding, with a thousand spears Troy's furious host assail'd! Funereal rites I then had shared, and praise from every Greek, Whom now the most inglorious death awaits. While thus he spake, a billow on his head Bursting impetuous, whirl'd the raft around, And dashing from his grasp the helm, himself Plunged far remote. Then came a sudden gust Of mingling winds, that in the middle snapp'd His mast, and hurried o'er the waves afar, Both sail and sail-yard fell into the flood. Long time submerged he lay, nor could with ease The violence of that dread shock surmount, Or rise to air again, so burthensome His drench'd apparel proved; but, at the last, He rose, and rising, sputter'd from his lips The brine that trickled copious from his brows. Nor, harass'd as he was, resign'd he yet His raft, but buffetting the waves aside With desperate efforts, seized it, and again Fast seated on the middle deck, escaped. Then roll'd the raft at random in the flood, Wallowing unwieldy, toss'd from wave to wave. As when in autumn, Boreas o'er the plain Conglomerated thorns before him drives, They, tangled, to each other close adhere, So her the winds drove wild about the Deep. By turns the South consign'd her to be sport For the rude North-wind, and by turns, the East Yielded her to the worrying West a prey. But Cadmus' beauteous daughter (Ino once, Now named Leucothea) saw him; mortal erst Was she, and trod the earth The Translator finding himself free to chuse between ???????? and ????????, has preferred the latter., but nymph become Of Ocean since, in honours shares divine. She mark'd his anguish, and, while toss'd he roam'd, Pitied Ulysses; from the flood, in form A cormorant, she flew, and on the raft Close-corded perching, thus the Chief address'd. Alas, unhappy! how hast thou incensed So terribly the Shaker of the shores, That he pursues thee with such numerous ills? Sink thee he cannot, wish it as he may. Thus do, (for I account thee not unwise,) Thy garments putting off, let drive thy raft As the winds will, then swimming, strive to reach Phæacia, where thy doom is to escape. Take this. This ribbon bind beneath thy breast, Celestial texture. Thenceforth every fear Of death dismiss, and laying once thy hands On the firm continent, unbind the zone, Which thou shalt cast far distant from the shore Into the Deep, turning thy face away. So saying, the Goddess gave into his hand The wonderous zone, and cormorant in form, Plunging herself into the waves again Headlong, was hidden by the closing flood. But still Ulysses sat perplex'd, and thus The toil-enduring Hero reason'd sad. Alas! I tremble lest some God design To ensnare me yet, bidding me quit the raft. But let me well beware how I obey Too soon that precept, for I saw the land Of my foretold deliverance far remote. Thus, therefore, will I do, for such appears My wiser course. So long as yet the planks Mutual adhere, continuing on board My raft, I will endure whatever woes; But when the waves shall shatter it, I will swim, My sole resource then left. While thus he mused, Neptune a billow of enormous bulk Hollow'd into an overwhelming arch On high up-heaving, smote him. As the wind Tempestuous, falling on some stubble-heap, The arid straws dissipates every way, So flew the timbers. He, a single beam Bestriding, oar'd it onward with his feet, As he had urged an horse. His raiment, then, Gift of Calypso, putting off, he bound His girdle on, and prone into the sea With wide-spread palms prepared for swimming, fell. Shore-shaker Neptune noted him; he shook His aweful brows, and in his heart he said. Thus, suffering many miseries roam the flood, Till thou shalt mingle with a race of men, Heaven's special favourites; yet even there Fear not that thou shalt feel thy sorrows light. He said, and scourging his bright steeds, arrived At Ægæ, where his glorious palace stands. But other thoughts Minerva's mind employ'd Jove's daughter; every wind binding beside, She lull'd them, and enjoin'd them all to sleep, But roused swift Boreas, and the billows broke Before Ulysses, that, deliver'd safe From a dire death, the noble Chief might mix With maritime Phæacia's sons renown'd. Two nights he wander'd, and two days, the flood Tempestuous, death expecting every hour; But when Aurora, radiant-hair'd, had brought The third day to a close, then ceased the wind, And breathless came a calm; he, nigh at hand The shore beheld, darting acute his sight Toward it, from a billow's towering top. Precious as to his children seems the life Of some fond father through disease long-time And pain stretch'd languid on his couch, the prey Of some vindictive Power, but now, at last, By gracious heaven to ease and health restored, So grateful to Ulysses' sight appear'd Forests and hills. Impatient with his feet To press the shore, he swam; but when within Such distance as a shout may fly, he came, The thunder of the sea against the rocks Then smote his ear; for hoarse the billows roar'd On the firm land, belch'd horrible abroad, And the salt spray dimm'd all things to his view. For neither port for ships nor sheltering cove Was there, but the rude coast a headland bluff Presented, rocks and craggy masses huge. Then, hope and strength exhausted both, deep-groan'd The Chief, and in his noble heart complain'd. Alas! though Jove hath given me to behold, Unhoped, the land again, and I have pass'd, Furrowing my way, these numerous waves, there seems No egress from the hoary flood for me. Sharp stones hem in the waters; wild the surge Raves everywhere; and smooth the rocks arise; Deep also is the shore, on which my feet No standing gain, or chance of safe escape. What if some billow catch me from the Deep Emerging, and against the pointed rocks Dash me conflicting with its force in vain? But should I, swimming, trace the coast in search Of sloping beach, haven or shelter'd creek, I fear lest, groaning, I be snatch'd again By stormy gusts into the fishy Deep, Or lest some monster of the flood receive Command to seize me, of the many such By the illustrious Amphitrite bred; For that the mighty Shaker of the shores Hates me implacable, too well I know. While such discourse within himself he held, A huge wave heaved him on the rugged coast, Where flay'd his flesh had been, and all his bones Broken together, but for the infused Good counsel of Minerva azure-eyed. With both hands suddenly he seized the rock, And groaning, clench'd it till the billow pass'd. So baffled he that wave; but yet again The refluent flood rush'd on him, and with force Resistless dash'd him far into the sea. As pebbles to the hollow polypus Extracted from his stony bed, adhere, So he, the rough rocks clasping, stripp'd his hands Raw, and the billows now whelm'd him again. Then had the hapless Hero premature Perish'd, but for sagacity inspired By Pallas azure-eyed. Forth from the waves Emerging, where the surf burst on the rocks, He coasted (looking landward as he swam) The shore, with hope of port or level beach. But when, still swimming, to the mouth he came Of a smooth-sliding river, there he deem'd Safest the ascent, for it was undeform'd By rocks, and shelter'd close from every wind. He felt the current, and thus, ardent, pray'd. Oh hear, whate'er thy name, Sovereign who rulest This river! at whose mouth from all the threats Of Neptune 'scaped, with rapture I arrive. Even the Immortal Gods the wanderer's prayer Respect, and such am I, who reach at length, Thy stream, and clasp thy knees, after long toil. I am thy suppliant. Oh King! pity me. He said; the river God at once repress'd His current, and it ceased; smooth he prepared The way before Ulysses, and the land Vouchsafed him easy at his channel's mouth. There once again he bent for ease his limbs Both arms and knees, in conflict with the floods Exhausted; swoln his body was all o'er, And from his mouth and nostrils stream'd the brine. Breathless and speechless, and of life well nigh Bereft he lay, through dreadful toil immense. But when, revived, his dissipated powers He recollected, loosing from beneath His breast the zone divine, he cast it far Into the brackish stream, and a huge wave Returning bore it downward to the sea, Where Ino caught it. Then, the river's brink Abandoning among the rushes prone He lay, kiss'd oft the soil, and sighing, said, Ah me! what sufferings must I now sustain, What doom, at last, awaits me? If I watch This woeful night, here, at the river's side, What hope but that the frost and copious dews, Weak as I am, my remnant small of life Shall quite extinguish, and the chilly air Breathed from the river at the dawn of day? But if, ascending this declivity I gain the woods, and in some thicket sleep, (If sleep indeed can find me overtoil'd And cold-benumb'd,) then I have cause to fear Lest I be torn by wild beasts and devour'd. Long time he mused, but at the last his course Bent to the woods, which not remote he saw From the sea-brink, conspicuous on a hill. Arrived, between two neighbour shrubs he crept, Both olives, this the fruitful, that the wild; A covert, which nor rough winds blowing moist Could penetrate, nor could the noon-day sun Smite through it, or unceasing showers pervade, So thick a roof the ample branches form'd Close interwoven; under these the Chief Retiring, with industrious hands a bed Collected broad of leaves, which there he found Abundant strew'd, such store as had sufficed Two travellers or three for covering warm, Though winter's roughest blasts had raged the while. That bed with joy the suffering Chief renown'd Contemplated, and occupying soon The middle space, hillock'd it high with leaves. As when some swain hath hidden deep his torch Beneath the embers, at the verge extreme Of all his farm, where, having neighbours none, He saves a seed or two of future flame Alive, doom'd else to fetch it from afar, So with dry leaves Ulysses overspread His body, on whose eyes Minerva pour'd The balm of sleep copious, that he might taste Repose again, after long toil severe. BOOK VI. ARGUMENT OF THE SIXTH BOOK. Minerva designing an interview between the daughter of Alcinoüs and Ulysses, admonishes her in a dream to carry down her cloaths to the river, that she may wash them, and make them ready for her approaching nuptials. That task performed, the Princess and her train amuse themselves with play; by accident they awake Ulysses; he comes forth from the wood, and applies himself with much address to Nausicaa, who compassionating his distressed condition, and being much affected by the dignity of his appearance, interests herself in his favour, and conducts him to the city. There then the noble sufferer lay, by sleep Oppress'd and labour; meantime, Pallas sought The populous city of Phæacia's sons. They, in old time, in Hypereia dwelt The spacious, neighbours of a giant race The haughty Cyclops, who, endued with power Superior, troubled them with frequent wrongs. Godlike Nausithoüs then arose, who thence To Scheria led them, from all nations versed In arts of cultivated life, remote; With bulwarks strong their city he enclosed, Built houses for them, temples to the Gods, And gave to each a portion of the soil. But he, already by decree of fate Had journey'd to the shades, and in his stead Alcinoüs, by the Gods instructed, reign'd. To his abode Minerva azure-eyed Repair'd, neglecting nought which might advance Magnanimous Ulysses' safe return. She sought the sumptuous chamber where, in form And feature perfect as the Gods, the young Nausicaa, daughter of the King, reposed. Fast by the pillars of the portal lay Two damsels, one on either side, adorn'd By all the Graces, and the doors were shut. Soft as a breathing air, she stole toward The royal virgin's couch, and at her head Standing, address'd her. Daughter she appear'd Of Dymas famed for maritime exploits, Her friend and her coeval; so disguised Cœrulean-eyed Minerva thus began. Nausicaa! wherefore hath thy mother borne A child so negligent? Thy garments share, Thy most magnificent, no thought of thine. Yet thou must marry soon, and must provide Robes for thyself, and for thy nuptial train. Thy fame, on these concerns, and honour stand; These managed well, thy parents shall rejoice. The dawn appearing, let us to the place Of washing, where thy work-mate I will be For speedier riddance of thy task, since soon The days of thy virginity shall end; For thou art woo'd already by the prime Of all Phæacia, country of thy birth. Come then,—solicit at the dawn of day Thy royal father, that he send thee forth With mules and carriage for conveyance hence Of thy best robes, thy mantles and thy zones. Thus, more commodiously thou shalt perform The journey, for the cisterns lie remote. So saying, Minerva, Goddess azure-eyed, Rose to Olympus, the reputed seat Eternal of the Gods, which never storms Disturb, rains drench, or snow invades, but calm The expanse and cloudless shines with purest day. There the inhabitants divine rejoice For ever, and (her admonition given) Cœrulean-eyed Minerva thither flew. Now came Aurora bright enthroned, whose rays Awaken'd fair Nausicaa; she her dream Remember'd wondering, and her parents sought Anxious to tell them. Them she found within. Beside the hearth her royal mother sat, Spinning soft fleeces with sea-purple dyed Among her menial maidens, but she met Her father whom the Nobles of the land Had summon'd, issuing abroad to join The illustrious Chiefs in council. At his side She stood, and thus her filial suit preferr'd. Sir In the Original, she calls him, pappa! a more natural style of address, and more endearing. But antient as this appellative is, it is also so familiar in modern use, that the Translator feared to hazard it.! wilt thou lend me of the royal wains A sumpter-carriage? for I wish to bear My costly cloaths but sullied and unfit For use, at present, to the river-side. It is but seemly that thou should'st repair Thyself to consultation with the Chiefs Of all Phæacia, clad in pure attire; And my own brothers five, who dwell at home, Two wedded, and the rest of age to wed, Are all desirous, when they dance, to wear Raiment new bleach'd; all which is my concern. So spake Nausicaa; for she dared not name Her own glad nuptials to her father's ear, Who, conscious yet of all her drift, replied. I grudge thee neither mules, my child, nor aught That thou canst ask beside. Go, and my train Shall furnish thee a sumpter-carriage forth High-built, strong-wheel'd, and of capacious size. So saying, he issued his command, whom quick His grooms obey'd. They in the court prepared The sumpter-carriage, and adjoin'd the mules. And now the virgin from her chamber, charged With raiment, came, which on the car she placed, And in the carriage-chest, meantime, the Queen, Her mother, viands of all kinds disposed, And fill'd a skin with wine. Nausicaa rose Into her seat; but, ere she went, received A golden cruse of oil from the Queen's hand For unction of herself and of her maids. Then, seizing scourge and reins, she lash'd the mules. They trampled loud the soil, straining to draw Herself with all her vesture; nor alone She went, but follow'd by her virgin train. At the delightful rivulet arrived Where those perennial cisterns were prepared With purest crystal of the fountain fed Profuse, sufficient for the deepest stains, Loosing the mules, they drove them forth to browze On the sweet herb beside the dimpled flood. The carriage, next, lightening, they bore in hand The garments down to the unsullied wave, And thrust them heaped into the pools, their task Dispatching brisk, and with an emulous haste. When they had all purified, and no spot Could now be seen or blemish more, they spread The raiment orderly along the beach Where dashing tides had cleansed the pebbles most, And laving, next, and smoothing o'er with oil Their limbs, all seated on the river's bank, They took repast, leaving the garments, stretch'd In noon-day fervour of the sun, to dry. Their hunger satisfied, at once arose The mistress and her train, and putting off Their head-attire, play'd wanton with the ball, The princess singing to her maids the while. Such as shaft-arm'd Diana roams the hills, Täygetus sky-capt, or Erymanth, The wild boar chasing, or fleet-footed hind, All joy; the rural nymphs, daughters of Jove, Sport with her, and Latona's heart exults; She high her graceful head above the rest And features lifts divine, though all be fair, With ease distinguishable from them all; So, all her train, she, virgin pure, surpass'd. But when the hour of her departure thence Approach'd, (the mules now yoked again, and all Her elegant apparel folded neat,) Minerva azure-eyed mused how to wake Ulysses, that he might behold the fair Virgin, his destined guide into the town. The Princess, then, casting the ball toward A maiden of her train, erroneous threw And plunged it deep into the dimpling stream. All shriek'd; Ulysses at the sound awoke, And, sitting, meditated thus the cause. Ah me! what mortal race inhabit here? Rude are they, contumacious and unjust? Or hospitable, and who fear the Gods? So shrill the cry and feminine of nymphs Fills all the air around, such as frequent The hills, clear fountains, and herbaceous meads. Is this a neighbourhood of men endued With voice articulate? But what avails To ask? I will myself go forth and see. So saying, divine Ulysses from beneath His thicket crept, and from the leafy wood A spreading branch pluck'd forcibly, design'd A decent skreen effectual, held before. So forth he went, as goes the lion forth, The mountain-lion, conscious of his strength, Whom winds have vexed and rains; fire fills his eyes, And whether herds or flocks, or woodland deer He find, he rends them, and adust for blood, Abstains not even from the guarded fold, Such sure to seem in virgin eyes, the Chief, All naked as he was, left his retreat, Reluctant, by necessity constrain'd. Him foul with sea-foam horror-struck they view'd, And o'er the jutting shores fled all dispersed. Nausicaa alone fled not; for her Pallas courageous made, and from her limbs, By power divine, all tremour took away. Firm she expected him; he doubtful stood, Or to implore the lovely maid, her knees Embracing, or, aloof standing, to ask In gentle terms discrete the gift of cloaths, And guidance to the city where she dwelt. Him so deliberating, most, at length, This counsel pleased; in suppliant terms aloof To sue to her, lest if he clasp'd her knees, The virgin should that bolder course resent. Then gentle, thus, and well-advised he spake. Oh Queen! thy earnest suppliant I approach. Art thou some Goddess, or of mortal race? For if some Goddess, and from heaven arrived, Diana, then, daughter of mighty Jove I deem thee most, for such as hers appear Thy form, thy stature, and thy air divine. But, if, of mortal race, thou dwell below, Thrice happy then, thy parents I account, And happy thrice thy brethren. Ah! the joy Which always for thy sake, their bosoms fills, When thee they view, all lovely as thou art, Entering majestic on the graceful dance. But him beyond all others blest I deem, The youth, who, wealthier than his rich compeers, Shall win and lead thee to his honour'd home. For never with these eyes a mortal form Beheld I comparable aught to thine, In man or woman. Wonder-rapt I gaze. Such erst, in Delos, I beheld a palm Beside the altar of Apollo, tall, And growing still; (for thither too I sail'd, And numerous were my followers in a voyage Ordain'd my ruin,) and as I then view'd That palm long time amazed, for never grew So straight a shaft, so lovely from the ground, So, Princess! thee with wonder I behold, Charm'd into fixt astonishment, by awe Alone forbidden to embrace thy knees, For I am one on whom much woe hath fallen. Yesterday I escaped (the twentieth day Of my distress by sea) the dreary Deep; For, all those days, the waves and rapid storms Bore me along, impetuous, from the isle Ogygia; till at length the will of heaven Cast me, that I might also here sustain Affliction, on your shore; for rest, I think, Is not for me. No. The immortal Gods Have much to accomplish ere that day arrive. But, oh Queen, pity me! who after long Calamities endured, of all who live Thee first approach, nor mortal know beside Of the inhabitants of all the land. Shew me your city; give me, although coarse, Some covering, (if coarse covering thou canst give,) And may the Gods thy largest wishes grant, House, husband, concord! for of all the gifts Of heaven, more precious none I deem, than peace 'Twixt wedded pair, and union undissolved; Envy torments their enemies, but joy Fills every virtuous breast, and most their own. To whom Nausicaa the fair replied. Since, stranger! neither base by birth thou seem'st, Nor unintelligent, (but Jove, the King Olympian, gives to good and bad alike Prosperity according to his will, And grief to thee, which thou must patient bear,) Now, therefore, at our land and city arrived, Nor garment thou shalt want, nor aught beside Due to a suppliant guest like thee forlorn. I will both show thee where our city stands, And who dwell here. Phæacia's sons possess This land; but I am daughter of their King The brave Alcinoüs, on whose sway depends For strength and wealth the whole Phæacian race. She said, and to her beauteous maidens gave Instant commandment:—My attendants, stay! Why flee ye thus, and whither, from the sight Of a mere mortal? Seems he in your eyes Some enemy of ours? The heart beats not, Nor shall it beat hereafter, which shall come An enemy to the Phæacian shores, So dear to the immortal Gods are we. Remote, amid the billowy Deep, we hold Our dwelling, utmost of all human-kind, And free from mixture with a foreign race. This man, a miserable wanderer comes, Whom we are bound to cherish, for the poor And stranger are from Jove, and trivial gifts To such are welcome. Bring ye therefore food And wine, my maidens, for the guest's regale, And lave him where the stream is shelter'd most. She spake; they stood, and by each other's words Encouraged, placed Ulysses where the bank O'erhung the stream, as fair Nausicaa bade, Daughter of King Alcinoüs the renown'd. Apparel also at his side they spread, Mantle and vest, and next, the limpid oil Presenting to him in the golden cruse, Exhorted him to bathe in the clear stream. Ulysses then the maidens thus bespake. Ye maidens, stand apart, that I may cleanse, Myself, my shoulders from the briny surf, And give them oil which they have wanted long. But in your presence I bathe not, ashamed To show myself unclothed to female eyes. He said; they went, and to Nausicaa told His answer; then the Hero in the stream His shoulders laved, and loins incrusted rough With the salt spray, and with his hands the scum Of the wild ocean from his locks express'd. Thus wash'd all over, and refresh'd with oil, He put the garments on, Nausicaa's gift. Then Pallas, progeny of Jove, his form Dilated more, and from his head diffused His curling locks like hyacinthine flowers. As when some artist, by Minerva made And Vulcan wise to execute all tasks Ingenious, binding with a golden verge Bright silver, finishes a graceful work, Such grace the Goddess o'er his ample chest Copious diffused, and o'er his manly brows. Retiring, on the beach he sat, with grace And dignity illumed, where, viewing him, The virgin Princess with amazement mark'd His beauty, and her damsels thus bespake. My white-arm'd maidens, listen to my voice! Not hated, sure, by all above, this man Among Phæacia's godlike sons arrives. At first I deem'd him of plebeian sort Dishonourable, but he now assumes A near resemblance to the Gods above. Ah! would to heaven it were my lot to call Husband, some native of our land like him Accomplish'd, and content to inhabit here! Give him, my maidens, food, and give him wine. She ended; they, obedient to her will, Both wine and food, dispatchful, placed, and glad, Before Ulysses; he rapacious ate, Toil-suffering Chief, and drank, for he had lived From taste of aliment long time estranged. On other thoughts meantime intent, her charge Of folded vestments neat the Princess placed Within the royal wain, then yoked the mules, And to her seat herself ascending call'd Ulysses to depart, and thus she spake. Up, stranger! seek the city. I will lead Thy steps toward my royal Father's house, Where all Phæacia's Nobles thou shalt see. But thou (for I account thee not unwise,) This course pursue. While through the fields we pass, And labours of the rural hind, so long With my attendants follow fast the mules And sumpter-carriage. I will be thy guide. But, once the summit gain'd, on which is built Our city with proud bulwarks fenced around, And laved on both sides by its pleasant port Of narrow entrance, where our gallant barks Line all the road, each station'd in her place, And where, adjoining close the splendid fane Of Neptune, stands the forum with huge stones From quarries thither drawn, constructed strong, In which the rigging of their barks they keep Sail-cloth and cordage, and make smooth their oars; (For bow and quiver the Phæacian race Heed not, but masts and oars, and ships well-poised, With which exulting they divide the flood,) Then, cautious, I would shun their bitter taunts Disgustful, lest they mock me as I pass; For of the meaner people some are coarse In the extreme, and it may chance that one, The basest there, seeing us shall exclaim,— What handsome stranger of athletic form Attends the Princess? Where had she the chance To find him? We shall see them wedded soon. Either she hath received some vagrant guest From distant lands, (for no land neighbours ours,) Or by her prayers incessant won, some God Hath left the heavens to be for ever hers. Tis well if she have found, by her own search, An husband for herself, since she accounts The nobles of Phæacia, who her hand Solicit numerous, worthy to be scorn'd.— Thus will they speak injurious. I should blame A virgin guilty of such conduct much, Myself, who reckless of her parents' will, Should so familiar with a man consort, Ere celebration of her spousal rites. But mark me, stranger! following my advice, Thou shalt the sooner at my father's hands Obtain safe conduct and conveyance home. Sacred to Pallas a delightful grove Of poplars skirts the road, which we shall reach Ere long; within that grove a fountain flows, And meads encircle it; my father's farm Is there, and his luxuriant garden-plot; A shout might reach it from the city-walls. There wait, till in the town arrived, we gain My father's palace, and when reason bids Suppose us there, then entering thou the town, Ask where Alcinoüs dwells, my valiant Sire. Well known is his abode, so that with ease A child might lead thee to it, for in nought The other houses of our land the house Resemble, in which dwells the Hero, King Alcinoüs. Once within the court received Pause not, but, with swift pace advancing, seek My mother; she beside a column sits In the hearth's blaze, twirling her fleecy threads Tinged with sea-purple, bright, magnificent, With all her maidens orderly behind. There also stands my father's throne, on which Seated, he drinks and banquets like a God. Pass that; then suppliant clasp my mother's knees, So shalt thou quickly win a glad return To thy own home, however far remote. Her favour once, and her kind aid secured, Thenceforth thou may'st expect thy friends to see, Thy dwelling, and thy native soil again. So saying, she with her splendid scourge the mules Lash'd onward. They (the stream soon left behind,) With even footsteps graceful smote the ground; But so she ruled them, managing with art The scourge, as not to leave afar, although Following on foot, Ulysses and her train. The sun had now declined, when in that grove Renown'd, to Pallas sacred, they arrived, In which Ulysses sat, and fervent thus Sued to the daughter of Jove ægis-arm'd. Daughter invincible of Jove supreme! Oh, hear me! hear me now, because when erst The mighty Shaker of the shores incensed Toss'd me from wave to wave, thou heard'st me not. Grant me among Phæacia's sons, to find Benevolence and pity of my woes! He spake, whose prayer well-pleased the Goddess heard, But reverencing the brother Neptune. of her sire, Appear'd not to Ulysses yet, whom he Pursued with fury to his native shores. BOOK VII. ARGUMENT OF THE SEVENTH BOOK. Nausicaa returns from the river, whom Ulysses follows. He halts by her direction, at a small distance from the palace, which at a convenient time he enters. He is well received by Alcinoüs and his Queen; and having related to them the manner of his being cast on the shore of Scheria, and received from Alcinoüs the promise of safe conduct home, retires to rest. Such prayer Ulysses, toil-worn Chief renown'd, To Pallas made; meantime the virgin, drawn By her stout mules, Phæacia's city reach'd, And, at her father's house arrived, the car Stay'd in the vestibule; her brothers five, All godlike youths, assembling quick around, Released the mules, and bore the raiment in. Meantime, to her own chamber she return'd, Where, soon as she arrived, an ancient dame Eurymedusa, by peculiar charge Attendant on that service, kindled fire. Sea-rovers her had from Epirus brought Long since, and to Alcinoüs she had fallen By public gift, for that he ruled, supreme, Phæacia, and as oft as he harangued The multitude, was reverenced as a God. She waited on the fair Nausicaa, she Her fuel kindled, and her food prepared. And now Ulysses from his seat arose To seek the city, around whom, his guard Benevolent, Minerva, cast a cloud, Lest, haply, some Phæacian should presume To insult the Chief, and question whence he came. But ere he enter'd yet the pleasant town, Minerva azure-eyed met him, in form A blooming maid, bearing her pitcher forth. She stood before him, and the noble Chief Ulysses, of the Goddess thus enquired. Daughter! wilt thou direct me to the house Of brave Alcinoüs, whom this land obeys? For I have here arrived, after long toil, And from a country far remote, a guest To all who in Phæacia dwell, unknown. To whom the Goddess of the azure-eyes. The mansion of thy search, stranger revered! Myself will shew thee; for not distant dwells Alcinoüs from my father's own abode: But hush! be silent—I will lead the way; Mark no man; question no man; for the sight Of strangers is unusual here, and cold The welcome by this people shown to such. They, trusting in swift ships, by the free grant Of Neptune traverse his wide waters, borne As if on wings, or with the speed of thought. So spake the Goddess, and with nimble pace Led on, whose footsteps he, as quick, pursued. But still the seaman-throng through whom he pass'd Perceived him not; Minerva, Goddess dread, That sight forbidding them, whose eyes she dimm'd With darkness shed miraculous around Her favourite Chief. Ulysses, wondering, mark'd Their port, their ships, their forum, the resort Of Heroes, and their battlements sublime Fenced with sharp stakes around, a glorious show! But when the King's august abode he reach'd, Minerva azure-eyed, then, thus began. My father! thou behold'st the house to which Thou badest me lead thee. Thou shalt find our Chiefs And high-born Princes banquetting within. But enter fearing nought, for boldest men Speed ever best, come whencesoe'er they may. First thou shalt find the Queen, known by her name Areta; lineal in descent from those Who gave Alcinoüs birth, her royal spouse. Neptune begat Nausithoüs, at the first, On Peribœa, loveliest of her sex, Latest-born daughter of Eurymedon, Heroic King of the proud giant race, Who, losing all his impious people, shared The same dread fate himself. Her Neptune loved, To whom she bore a son, the mighty prince Nausithoüs, in his day King of the land. Nausithoüs himself two sons begat, Rhexenor and Alcinoüs. Phœbus slew Rhexenor at his home, a bridegroom yet, Who, father of no son, one daughter left, Areta, wedded to Alcinoüs now, And whom the Sovereign in such honour holds, As woman none enjoys of all on earth Existing, subjects of an husband's power. Like veneration she from all receives Unfeign'd, from her own children, from himself Alcinoüs, and from all Phæacia's race, Who, gazing on her as she were divine, Shout when she moves in progress through the town. For she no wisdom wants, but sits, herself, Arbitress of such contests as arise Between her favourites, and decides aright. Her countenance once and her kind aid secured, Thou may'st thenceforth expect thy friends to see, Thy dwelling, and thy native soil again. So Pallas spake, Goddess cœrulean-eyed, And o'er the untillable and barren Deep Departing, Scheria left, land of delight, Whence reaching Marathon, and Athens next, She pass'd into Erectheus' fair abode. Ulysses, then, toward the palace moved Of King Alcinoüs, but immersed in thought Stood, first, and paused, ere with his foot he press'd The brazen threshold; for a light he saw As of the sun or moon illuming clear The palace of Phæacia's mighty King. Walls plated bright with brass, on either side Stretch'd from the portal to the interior house, With azure cornice crown'd; the doors were gold Which shut the palace fast; silver the posts Rear'd on a brazen threshold, and above, The lintels, silver, architraved with gold. Mastiffs, in gold and silver, lined the approach On either side, by art celestial framed Of Vulcan, guardians of Alcinoüs gate For ever, unobnoxious to decay. Sheer from the threshold to the inner house Fixt thrones the walls, through all their length, adorn'd, With mantles overspread of subtlest warp Transparent, work of many a female hand. On these the princes of Phæacia sat, Holding perpetual feasts, while golden youths On all the sumptuous altars stood, their hands With burning torches charged, which, night by night, Shed radiance over all the festive throng. Full fifty female menials served the King In household offices; the rapid mills These turning, pulverize the mellow'd grain, Those, seated orderly, the purple fleece Wind off, or ply the loom, restless as leaves Of lofty poplars fluttering in the breeze; ????????? ?? ??????? ??????????? ????? ??????. Pope has given no translation of this line in the text of his work, but has translated it in a note. It is variously interpreted by commentators; the sense which is here given of it is that recommended by Eustathius.Bright as with oil the new-wrought texture shone. Far as Phæacian mariners all else Surpass, the swift ship urging through the floods, So far in tissue-work the women pass All others, by Minerva's self endow'd With richest fancy and superior skill. Without the court, and to the gates adjoin'd A spacious garden lay, fenced all around Secure, four acres measuring complete. There grew luxuriant many a lofty tree, Pomegranate, pear, the apple blushing bright, The honied fig, and unctuous olive smooth. Those fruits, nor winter's cold nor summer's heat Fear ever, fail not, wither not, but hang Perennial, while unceasing zephyr breathes Gently on all, enlarging these, and those Maturing genial; in an endless course Pears after pears to full dimensions swell, Figs follow figs, grapes clustering grow again Where clusters grew, and (every apple stript) The boughs soon tempt the gatherer as before. There too, well-rooted, and of fruit profuse, His vineyard grows; part, wide-extended, basks In the sun's beams; the arid level glows; In part they gather, and in part they tread The wine-press, while, before the eye, the grapes Here put their blossom forth, there, gather fast Their blackness. On the garden's verge extreme Flowers of all hues smile all the year, arranged With neatest art judicious; and amid The lovely scene two fountains welling forth, One visits, into every part diffused, The garden-ground, the other soft beneath The threshold steals into the palace-court, Whence every citizen his vase supplies. Such were the ample blessings on the house Of King Alcinoüs by the Gods bestow'd. Ulysses wondering stood, and when, at length, Silent he had the whole fair scene admired, With rapid step enter'd the royal gate. The Chiefs he found and Senators within Libation pouring to the vigilant spy Mercurius, whom with wine they worshipp'd last Of all the Gods, and at the hour of rest. Ulysses, toil-worn Hero, through the house Pass'd undelaying, by Minerva thick With darkness circumfused, till he arrived Where King Alcinoüs and Areta sat. Around Areta's knees his arms he cast, And in that moment, broken clear away The cloud all went, shed on him from above. Dumb sat the guests, seeing the unknown Chief, And wondering gazed. He thus his suit preferr'd. Areta, daughter of the Godlike Prince Rhexenor! suppliant at thy knees I fall, Thy royal spouse imploring, and thyself, (After ten thousand toils,) and these your guests, To whom heaven grant felicity, and to leave Their treasures to their babes, with all the rights And honours, by the people's suffrage, theirs! But oh vouchsafe me, who have wanted long And ardent wish'd my home, without delay Safe conduct to my native shores again! Such suit he made, and in the ashes sat At the hearth-side; they mute long time remain'd, Till, at the last, the ancient Hero spake Echeneus, eldest of Phæacia's sons, With eloquence beyond the rest endow'd, Rich in traditionary lore, and wise In all, who thus, benevolent, began. Not honourable to thyself, O King! Is such a sight, a stranger on the ground At the hearth-side seated, and in the dust. Meantime, thy guests, expecting thy command, Move not; thou therefore raising by his hand The stranger, lead him to a throne, and bid The heralds mingle wine, that we may pour To thunder-bearing Jove, the suppliant's friend. Then let the cateress for thy guest produce Supply, a supper from the last regale. Soon as those words Alcinoüs heard, the King, Upraising by his hand the prudent Chief Ulysses from the hearth, he made him sit On a bright throne, displacing for his sake Laodamas his son, the virtuous youth Who sat beside him, and whom most he loved. And now, a maiden charged with golden ewer And with an argent laver, pouring, first, Pure water on his hands, supply'd him, next, With a resplendent table, which the chaste Directress of the stores furnish'd with bread And dainties, remnants of the last regale. Then ate the Hero toil-inured, and drank, And to his herald thus Alcinoüs spake. Pontonoüs! mingling wine, bear it around To every guest in turn, that we may pour To thunder-bearer Jove, the stranger's friend, And guardian of the suppliant's sacred rights. He said; Pontonoüs, as he bade, the wine Mingled delicious, and the cups dispensed With distribution regular to all. When each had made libation, and had drunk Sufficient, then, Alcinoüs thus began. Phæacian Chiefs and Senators, I speak The dictates of my mind, therefore attend! Ye all have feasted;—to your homes and sleep. We will assemble at the dawn of day More senior Chiefs, that we may entertain The stranger here, and to the Gods perform Due sacrifice; the convoy that he asks Shall next engage our thoughts, that free from pain And from vexation, by our friendly aid He may revisit, joyful and with speed, His native shore, however far remote. No inconvenience let him feel or harm, Ere his arrival; but, arrived, thenceforth He must endure whatever lot the Fates Spun for him in the moment of his birth. But should he prove some Deity from heaven Descended, then the Immortals have in view Designs not yet apparent; for the Gods Have ever from of old reveal'd themselves At our solemnities, have on our seats Sat with us evident, and shared the feast; And even if a single traveller Of the Phæacians meet them, all reserve They lay aside; for with the Gods we boast As near affinity as do themselves The Cyclops, or the Giant race profane The Scholiast explains the passage thus—We resemble the Gods in righteousness as much as the Cyclops and Giants resembled each other in impiety. But in this sense of it there is something intricate and contrary to Homer's manner. We have seen that they derived themselves from Neptune, which sufficiently justifies the above interpretation.. To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied. Alcinoüs! think not so. Resemblance none In figure or in lineaments I bear To the immortal tenants of the skies, But to the sons of earth; if ye have known A man afflicted with a weight of woe Peculiar, let me be with him compared; Woes even passing his could I relate, And all inflicted on me by the Gods. But let me eat, comfortless as I am, Uninterrupted; for no call is loud As that of hunger in the ears of man; Importunate, unreasonable, it constrains His notice, more than all his woes beside. So, I much sorrow feel, yet not the less Hear I the blatant appetite demand Due sustenance, and with a voice that drowns Even all my sufferings, till itself be fill'd. But expedite ye at the dawn of day My safe return into my native land, After much misery; and let life itself Forsake me, may I but once more behold All that is mine, in my own lofty abode. He spake, whom all applauded, and advised, Unanimous, the guest's conveyance home, Who had so fitly spoken. When, at length, All had libation made and were sufficed, Departing to his house, each sought repose. But still Ulysses in the hall remain'd, Where, godlike King, Alcinoüs at his side Sat, and Areta; the attendants clear'd Meantime the board, and thus the Queen white arm'd, (Marking the vest and mantle which he wore, And which her maidens and herself had made) In accents wing'd with eager haste began. Stranger! the first enquiry shall be mine; Who art, and whence? From whom received'st thou these? Saidst not—I came a wanderer o'er the Deep? To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied. Oh Queen! the task were difficult to unfold In all its length the story of my woes, For I have numerous from the Gods received; But I will answer thee as best I may. There is a certain isle, Ogygia, placed Far distant in the Deep; there dwells, by man Alike unvisited and by the Gods, Calypso, beauteous nymph, but deeply skill'd In artifice, and terrible in power, Daughter of Atlas. Me alone my fate Her miserable inmate made, when Jove Had riven asunder with his candent bolt My bark in the mid-sea. There perish'd all The valiant partners of my toils, and I My vessel's keel embracing day and night With folded arms, nine days was borne along. But on the tenth dark night, as pleased the Gods, They drove me to Ogygia, where resides Calypso, beauteous nymph, dreadful in power; She rescued, cherish'd, fed me, and her wish Was to confer on me immortal life, Exempt for ever from the sap of age. But me her offer'd boon sway'd not. Seven years I there abode continual, with my tears Bedewing ceaseless my ambrosial robes, Calypso's gift divine; but when, at length, (Seven years elapsed) the circling eighth arrived, She then, herself, my quick departure thence Advised, by Jove's own mandate overawed, Which even her had influenced to a change. On a well-corded raft she sent me forth With numerous presents; bread she put and wine On board, and clothed me in immortal robes; She sent before me also a fair wind Fresh-blowing, but not dangerous. Seventeen days I sail'd the flood continual, and descried, On the eighteenth, your shadowy mountains tall, When my exulting heart sprang at the sight, All wretched as I was, and still ordain'd To strive with difficulties many and hard From adverse Neptune; he the stormy winds Exciting opposite, my watery way Impeded, and the waves heaved to a bulk Immeasurable, such as robb'd me soon Deep-groaning, of the raft, my only hope; For her the tempest scatter'd, and myself This ocean measured swimming, till the winds And mighty waters cast me on your shore. Me there emerging, the huge waves had dash'd Full on the land, where, incommodious most, The shore presented only roughest rocks, But, leaving it, I swam the Deep again, Till now, at last, a river's gentle stream Received me, by no rocks deform'd, and where No violent winds the shelter'd bank annoy'd. I flung myself on shore, exhausted, weak, Needing repose; ambrosial night came on, When from the Jove-descended stream withdrawn, I in a thicket lay'd me down on leaves Which I had heap'd together, and the Gods O'erwhelm'd my eye-lids with a flood of sleep. There under wither'd leaves, forlorn, I slept All the long night, the morning, and the noon, But balmy sleep, at the decline of day, Broke from me; then, your daughter's train I heard Sporting, with whom she also sported, fair And graceful as the Gods. To her I kneel'd. She, following the dictates of a mind Ingenuous, pass'd in her behaviour all Which even ye could from an age like hers Have hoped; for youth is ever indiscrete. She gave me plenteous food, with richest wine Refresh'd my spirit, taught me where to bathe, And clothed me as thou seest; thus, though a prey To many sorrows, I have told thee truth. To whom Alcinoüs answer thus return'd. My daughter's conduct, I perceive, hath been In this erroneous, that she led thee not Hither, at once, with her attendant train, For thy first suit was to herself alone. Thus then Ulysses, wary Chief, replied. Blame not, O Hero, for so slight a cause Thy faultless child; she bade me follow them, But I refused, by fear and awe restrain'd, Lest thou should'st feel displeasure at that sight Thyself; for we are all, in every clime, Suspicious, and to worst constructions prone. So spake Ulysses, to whom thus the King. I bear not, stranger! in my breast an heart Causeless irascible; for at all times A temperate equanimity is best. And oh, I would to heaven, that, being such As now thou art, and of one mind with me, Thou would'st accept my daughter, would'st become My son-in-law, and dwell contented here! House would I give thee, and possessions too, Were such thy choice; else, if thou choose it not, No man in all Phæacia shall by force Detain thee. Jupiter himself forbid! For proof, I will appoint thee convoy hence To-morrow; and while thou by sleep subdued Shalt on thy bed repose, they with their oars Shall brush the placid flood, till thou arrive At home, or at what place soe'er thou would'st, Though far more distant than Eubœa lies, Remotest isle from us, by the report Of ours, who saw it when they thither bore Golden-hair'd Rhadamanthus o'er the Deep, To visit earth-born Tityus. To that isle They went; they reach'd it, and they brought him thence Back to Phæacia, in one day, with ease. Thou also shalt be taught what ships I boast Unmatch'd in swiftness, and how far my crews Excel, upturning with their oars the brine. He ceased; Ulysses toil-inured his words Exulting heard, and praying, thus replied. Eternal Father! may the King perform His whole kind promise! grant him in all lands A never-dying name, and grant to me To visit safe my native shores again! Thus they conferr'd; and now Areta bade Her fair attendants dress a fleecy couch Under the portico, with purple rugs Resplendent, and with arras spread beneath, And over all with cloaks of shaggy pile. Forth went the maidens, bearing each a torch, And, as she bade, prepared in haste a couch Of depth commodious, then, returning, gave Ulysses welcome summons to repose. Stranger! thy couch is spread. Hence to thy rest. So they—Thrice grateful to his soul the thought Seem'd of repose. There slept Ulysses then, On his carved couch, beneath the portico, But in the inner-house Alcinoüs found His place of rest, and hers with royal state Prepared, the Queen his consort, at his side. BOOK VIII. ARGUMENT OF THE EIGHTH BOOK. The Phæacians consult on the subject of Ulysses. Preparation is made for his departure. Alcinoüs entertains them at his table. Games follow the entertainment. Demodocus the bard, sings, first the loves of Mars and Venus, then the introduction of the wooden horse into Troy. Ulysses, much affected by his song, is questioned by Alcinoüs, whence, and who he is, and what is the cause of his sorrow. But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn, Blush'd in the East, then from his bed arose The sacred might of the Phæacian King. Then uprose also, city-waster Chief, Ulysses, whom the King Alcinoüs Led forth to council at the ships convened. There, side by side, on polish'd stones they sat Frequent; meantime, Minerva in the form Of King Alcinoüs' herald ranged the town, With purpose to accelerate the return Of brave Ulysses to his native home, And thus to every Chief the Goddess spake. Phæacian Chiefs and Senators, away! Haste all to council on the stranger held, Who hath of late beneath Alcinoüs' roof Our King arrived, a wanderer o'er the Deep, But in his form, majestic as a God. So saying, she roused the people, and at once The seats of all the senate-court were fill'd With fast-assembling throngs, no few of whom Had mark'd Ulysses with admiring eyes. Then Pallas o'er his head and shoulders broad Diffusing grace celestial, his whole form Dilated, and to statelier height advanced, That worthier of all reverence he might seem To the Phæacians, and might many a feat Atchieve, with which they should assay his force. When, therefore, the assembly now was full, Alcinoüs, them addressing, thus began. Phæacian Chiefs and Senators! I speak The dictates of my mind, therefore attend. This guest unknown to me, hath, wandering, found My palace, either from the East arrived, Or from some nation on our western side. Safe conduct home he asks, and our consent Here wishes ratified, whose quick return Be it our part, as usual, to promote; For at no time the stranger, from what coast Soe'er, who hath resorted to our doors, Hath long complain'd of his detention here. Haste—draw ye down into the sacred Deep A vessel of prime speed, and from among The people, fifty and two youths select, Approved the best; then lashing fast the oars, Leave her, that at my palace ye may make Short feast, for which myself will all provide. Thus I enjoin the crew; but as for those Of sceptred rank, I bid them all alike To my own board, that here we may regale The stranger nobly, and let none refuse. Call, too, Demodocus, the bard divine, To share my banquet, whom the Gods have blest With powers of song delectable, unmatch'd By any, when his genius once is fired. He ceased, and led the way, whom follow'd all The sceptred senators, while to the house An herald hasted of the bard divine. Then, fifty mariners and two, from all The rest selected, to the coast repair'd, And, from her station on the sea-bank, launched The galley down into the sacred Deep. They placed the canvass and the mast on board, Arranged the oars, unfurl'd the shining sail, And leaving her in depth of water moor'd, All sought the palace of Alcinoüs. There soon the portico, the court, the hall Were fill'd with multitudes of young and old, For whose regale the mighty monarch slew Two beeves, twelve sheep, and twice four fatted brawns. They flay'd them first, then busily their task Administering, prepared the joyous feast. And now the herald came, leading with care The tuneful bard; dear to the muse was he, Who yet appointed him both good and ill, Took from him sight, but gave him strains divine. For him Pontonoüs in the midst disposed An argent-studded throne, thrusting it close To a tall column, where he hung his lyre Above his head, and taught him where it hung. He set before him, next, a polish'd board And basket, and a goblet fill'd with wine For his own use, and at his own command. Then, all assail'd at once the ready feast, And when nor hunger more nor thirst they felt, Then came the muse, and roused the bard to sing Exploits of men renown'd; it was a song, In that day to the highest heaven extoll'd. He sang of a dispute kindled between The son of Peleus, and Laertes' Agamemnon having inquired at Delphos, at what time the war should end, was answered, that the conclusion of it should happen at a time when a dispute should arise between two of his principal commanders. That dispute occurred at the time here alluded to, Achilles recommending force as most likely to reduce the city, and Ulysses stratagem. son, Both seated at a feast held to the Gods. That contest Agamemnon, King of men, Between the noblest of Achaia's host Hearing, rejoiced; for when in Pytho erst He pass'd the marble threshold to consult The oracle of Apollo, such dispute The voice divine had to his ear announced; For then it was that, first, the storm of war Came rolling on, ordain'd long time to afflict Troy and the Greecians, by the will of Jove. So sang the bard illustrious; then his robe Of purple dye with both hands o'er his head Ulysses drew, behind its ample folds Veiling his face, through fear to be observed By the Phæacians weeping at the song; And ever as the bard harmonious ceased, He wiped his tears, and, drawing from his brows The mantle pour'd libation to the Gods. But when the Chiefs (for they delighted heard Those sounds,) solicited again the bard, And he renew'd the strain, then covering close His countenance, as before, Ulysses wept. Thus, unperceived by all, the Hero mourn'd, Save by Alcinoüs; he alone his tears, (Beside him seated) mark'd, and his deep sighs O'erhearing, the Phæacians thus bespake. Phæacia's Chiefs and Senators, attend! We have regaled sufficient, and the harp Heard to satiety, companion sweet And seasonable of the festive hour. Now go we forth for honourable proof Of our address in games of every kind, That this our guest may to his friends report, At home arrived, that none like us have learn'd To leap, to box, to wrestle, and to run. So saying, he led them forth, whose steps the guests All follow'd, and the herald hanging high The sprightly lyre, took by his hand the bard Demodocus, whom he the self-same way Conducted forth by which the Chiefs had gone Themselves, for that great spectacle prepared. They sought the forum; countless swarm'd the throng Behind them as they went, and many a youth Strong and courageous to the strife arose. Upstood Acroneus and Ocyalus, Elatreus, Nauteus, Prymneus, after whom Anchialus with Anabeesineus Arose, Eretmeus, Ponteus, Proreus bold, Amphialus and Thöon. Then arose, In aspect dread as homicidal Mars, Euryalus, and for his graceful form (After Laodamas) distinguish'd most Of all Phæacia's sons, Naubolides. Three also from Alcinoüs sprung, arose, Laodamas, his eldest; Halius, next, His second-born; and godlike Clytoneus. Of these, some started for the runner's prize. ????? ?? ??? ?????? ?????? ??????—This expression is by the commentators generally understood to be significant of the effort which they made at starting, but it is not improbable that it relates merely to the measurement of the course, otherwise, ?????????? ????????—will be tautologous.They gave the race its limits. All at once Along the dusty champaign swift they flew. But Clytoneus, illustrious youth, outstripp'd All competition; far as mules surpass Slow oxen furrowing the fallow ground, So far before all others he arrived Victorious, where the throng'd spectators stood. Some tried the wrestler's toil severe, in which Euryalus superior proved to all. In the long leap Amphialus prevail'd; Elatreus most successful hurl'd the quoit, And at the cestus In boxing., last, the noble son Of Scheria's King, Laodamas excell'd. When thus with contemplation of the games All had been gratified, Alcinoüs' son Laodamas, arising, them address'd. Friends! ask we now the stranger, if he boast Proficiency in aught. His figure seems Not ill; in thighs, and legs, and arms he shews Much strength, and in his brawny neck; nor youth Hath left him yet, though batter'd he appears With numerous troubles, and misfortune-flaw'd. Nor know I hardships in the world so sure To break the strongest down, as those by sea. Then answer thus Euryalus return'd. Thou hast well said, Laodamas; thyself Approaching, speak to him, and call him forth. Which when Alcinous' noble offspring heard, Advancing from his seat, amid them all He stood, and to Ulysses thus began. Stand forth, oh guest, thou also: prove thy skill (If any such thou boast) in games like ours, Which likeliest thou hast learn'd; for greater praise Hath no man, while he lives, than that he know His feet to exercise and hands aright. Come then; make trial; scatter wide thy cares; We will not hold thee long; the ship is launch'd Already, and the crew stand all prepared. To whom replied the wily Chief renown'd. Wherefore, as in derision, have ye call'd Me forth, Laodamas, to these exploits? No games have I, but many a grief, at heart, And with far other struggles worn, here sit Desirous only of conveyance home, For which both King and people I implore. Then him Euryalus aloud reproach'd. I well believed it, friend! in thee the guise I see not of a man expert in feats Athletic, of which various are perform'd In every land; thou rather seem'st with ships Familiar; one accustom'd to controul Some crew of trading mariners; well-learn'd In stowage, pilotage, and wealth acquired By rapine, but of no gymnastic powers. To whom Ulysses, frowning dark, replied. Thou hast ill spoken, sir, and like a man Regardless whom he wrongs. Therefore the Gods Give not endowments graceful in each kind, Of body, mind, and utterance, all to one. This man in figure less excels, yet Jove Crowns him with eloquence; his hearers charm'd Behold him, while with modest confidence He bears the prize of fluent speech from all, And in the streets is gazed on as a God! Another, in his form the Powers above Resembles, but no grace around his words Twines itself elegant. So, thou in form Hast excellence to boast; a God employ'd To make a master-piece in human shape, Could but produce proportions just as thine; Yet hast thou an untutor'd intellect. Thou much hast moved me; thy unhandsome phrase Hath roused my wrath; I am not, as thou say'st, A novice in these sports, but took the lead In all, while youth and strength were on my side. But I am now in bands of sorrow held, And of misfortune, having much endured In war, and buffeting the boisterous waves. Yet, though with misery worn, I will essay My strength among you; for thy words had teeth Whose bite hath pinch'd and pain'd me to the proof. He said; and mantled as he was, a quoit Upstarting, seized, in bulk and weight all those Transcending far, by the Phæacians used. Swiftly he swung, and from his vigorous hand Sent it. Loud sang the stone, and as it flew The maritime Phæacians low inclined Their heads beneath it; over all the marks, And far beyond them, sped the flying rock. Minerva in a human form, the cast Prodigious measured, and aloud exclaim'd. Stranger! the blind himself might with his hands Feel out the 'vantage here. Thy quoit disdains Fellowship with a crowd, borne far beyond. Fear not a losing game; Phæacian none Will reach thy measure, much less overcast. She ceased; Ulysses, hardy Chief, rejoiced That in the circus he had found a judge So favourable, and with brisker tone, As less in wrath, the multitude address'd. Young men, reach this, and I will quickly heave Another such, or yet a heavier quoit. Then, come the man whose courage prompts him forth To box, to wrestle with me, or to run; For ye have chafed me much, and I decline No strife with any here, but challenge all Phæacia, save Laodamas alone. He is mine host. Who combats with his friend? To call to proof of hardiment the man Who entertains him in a foreign land, Would but evince the challenger a fool, Who, so, should cripple his own interest there. As for the rest, I none refuse, scorn none, But wish for trial of you, and to match In opposition fair my force with yours. There is no game athletic in the use Of all mankind, too difficult for me; I handle well the polish'd bow, and first Amid a thousand foes strike whom I mark, Although a throng of warriors at my side Imbattled, speed their shafts at the same time. Of all Achaia's sons who erst at Troy Drew bow, the sole who bore the prize from me Was Philoctetes; I resign it else To none now nourish'd with the fruits of earth. Yet mean I no comparison of myself With men of antient times, with Hercules, Or with Oechalian Eurytus, who, both, The Gods themselves in archery defied. Soon, therefore, died huge Eurytus, ere yet Old age he reach'd; him, angry to be call'd To proof of archership, Apollo slew. But if ye name the spear, mine flies a length By no man's arrow reach'd; I fear no foil From the Phæacians, save in speed alone; For I have suffer'd hardships, dash'd and drench'd By many a wave, nor had I food on board At all times, therefore am I much unstrung. He spake, and silent the Phæacians sat, Of whom alone Alcinoüs thus replied. Since, stranger, not ungraceful is thy speech, Who hast but vindicated in our ears Thy question'd prowess, angry that this youth Reproach'd thee in the presence of us all, That no man qualified to give his voice In public might affront thy courage more; Now mark me, therefore, that in time to come, While feasting with thy children and thy spouse, Thou may'st inform the Heroes of thy land Even of our proficiency in arts By Jove enjoin'd us in our father's days. We boast not much the boxer's skill, nor yet The wrestler's; but light-footed in the race Are we, and navigators well inform'd. Our pleasures are the feast, the harp, the dance, Garments for change; the tepid bath; the bed. Come, ye Phæacians, beyond others skill'd To tread the circus with harmonious steps, Come, play before us; that our guest, arrived In his own country, may inform his friends How far in seamanship we all excel, In running, in the dance, and in the song. Haste! bring ye to Demodocus his lyre Clear-toned, left somewhere in our hall at home. So spake the godlike King, at whose command The herald to the palace quick return'd To seek the charming lyre. Meantime arose Nine arbiters, appointed to intend The whole arrangement of the public games, To smooth the circus-floor, and give the ring Its compass, widening the attentive throng. Ere long the herald came, bearing the harp, With which Demodocus supplied, advanced Into the middle area, around whom Stood blooming youths, all skilful in the dance. With footsteps justly timed all smote at once The sacred floor; Ulysses wonder-fixt, The ceaseless play of twinkling The Translator is indebted to Mr. Grey for an epithet more expressive of the original (??????????) than any other, perhaps, in all our language. See the Ode on the Progress of Poetry. “To brisk notes in cadence beating, Glance their many-twinkling feet.” feet admired. Then tuning his sweet chords, Demodocus A jocund strain began, his theme, the loves Of Mars and Cytherea chaplet-crown'd; How first, clandestine, they embraced beneath The roof of Vulcan; her, by many a gift Seduced, Mars won, and with adulterous lust The bed dishonour'd of the King of fire. The Sun, a witness of their amorous sport, Bore swift the tale to Vulcan; he, apprized Of that foul deed, at once his smithy sought, In secret darkness of his inmost soul Contriving vengeance; to the stock he heaved His anvil huge, on which he forged a snare Of bands indissoluble, by no art To be untied, durance for ever firm. The net prepared, he bore it, fiery-wroth To his own chamber and his nuptial couch, Where stretching them from post to post, he wrapp'd With those fine meshes all his bed around, And hung them numerous from the roof, diffused Like spiders' filaments, which not the Gods Themselves could see, so subtle were the toils. When thus he had encircled all his bed On every side, he feign'd a journey thence To Lemnos, of all cities that adorn The earth, the city that he favours most. Nor kept the God of the resplendent reins Mars, drowsy watch, but seeing that the famed Artificer of heaven had left his home, Flew to the house of Vulcan, hot to enjoy The Goddess with the wreath-encircled brows. She, newly from her potent Sire return'd The son of Saturn, sat. Mars, entering, seized Her hand, hung on it, and thus urged his suit. To bed, my fair, and let us love! for lo! Thine husband is from home, to Lemnos gone, And to the Sintians, men of barbarous speech. He spake, nor she was loth, but bedward too Like him inclined; so then, to bed they went, And as they lay'd them down, down stream'd the net Around them, labour exquisite of hands By ingenuity divine inform'd. Small room they found, so prison'd; not a limb Could either lift, or move, but felt at once Entanglement from which was no escape. And now the glorious artist, ere he yet Had reach'd the Lemnian isle, limping, return'd From his feign'd journey, for his spy the Sun Had told him all. With aching heart he sought His home, and, standing in the vestibule, Frantic with indignation roar'd to heaven, And roar'd again, summoning all the Gods.— Oh Jove! and all ye Powers for ever blest! Here! hither look, that ye may view a sight Ludicrous, yet too monstrous to be borne, How Venus always with dishonour loads Her cripple spouse, doating on fiery Mars! And wherefore? for that he is fair in form And sound of foot, I ricket-boned, and weak. Whose fault is this? Their fault, and theirs alone Who gave me being; ill-employ'd were they Begetting me, one better far unborn. See where they couch together on my bed Lascivious! ah, sight hateful to my eyes! Yet cooler wishes will they feel, I ween, To press my bed hereafter; here to sleep Will little please them, fondly as they love. But these my toils and tangles will suffice To hold them here, till Jove shall yield me back Complete, the sum of all my nuptial gifts Paid to him for the shameless strumpet's sake His daughter, as incontinent as fair. He said, and in the brazen-floor'd abode Of Jove the Gods assembled. Neptune came Earth-circling Power; came Hermes friend of man, And regent of the far-commanding bow, Apollo also came; but chaste reserve Bashful kept all the Goddesses at home. The Gods by whose beneficence all live, Stood in the portal; infinite arose The laugh of heaven, all looking down intent On that shrewd project of the smith divine, And, turning to each other, thus they said. Bad works speed ill. The slow o'ertakes the swift. So Vulcan, tardy as he is, by craft Hath outstript Mars, although the fleetest far Of all who dwell in heaven, and the light-heel'd Must pay the adulterer's forfeit to the lame. So spake the Powers immortal; then the King Of radiant shafts thus question'd Mercury. Jove's son, heaven's herald, Hermes, bounteous God! Would'st thou such stricture close of bands endure For golden Venus lying at thy side; Whom answer'd thus the messenger of heaven. Archer divine! yea, and with all my heart; And be the bands which wind us round about Thrice these, innumerable, and let all The Gods and Goddesses in heaven look on, So I may clasp Vulcan's fair spouse the while. He spake; then laugh'd the Immortal powers again. But not so Neptune; he with earnest suit The glorious artist urged to the release Of Mars, and thus in accents wing'd he said. Loose him; accept my promise; he shall pay Full recompense in presence of us all. Then thus the limping smith far-famed replied. Earth-circler Neptune, spare me that request. The original line has received such a variety of interpretations, that a Translator seems free to chuse. It has, however, a proverbial turn, which I have endeavoured to preserve, and have adopted that sense of the words which appears best to accord with what immediately follows. Vulcan pleads his own inability to enforce the demand, as a circumstance that made Neptune's promise unacceptable.Lame suitor, lame security. What bands Could I devise for thee among the Gods, Should Mars, emancipated once, escape, Leaving both debt and durance far behind? Him answer'd then the Shaker of the shores. I tell thee, Vulcan, that if Mars by flight Shun payment, I will pay, myself, the fine. To whom the glorious artist of the skies. Thou must not, canst not, shalt not be refused. So saying the might of Vulcan loosed the snare, And they, detain'd by those coercive bands No longer, from the couch upstarting flew, Mars into Thrace, and to her Paphian home The Queen of smiles, where deep in myrtle groves Her incense-breathing altar stands embower'd. Her there, the Graces laved, and oils diffused O'er all her form, ambrosial, such as add Fresh beauty to the Gods for ever young, And cloathed her in the loveliest robes of heaven. Such was the theme of the illustrious bard. Ulysses with delight that song, and all The maritime Phæacian concourse heard. Alcinoüs, then, (for in the dance they pass'd All others,) call'd his sons to dance alone, Halius and Laodamas; they gave The purple ball into their hands, the work Exact of Polybus; one, re-supine, Upcast it high toward the dusky clouds, The other springing into air, with ease Received it, ere he sank to earth again. When thus they oft had sported with the ball Thrown upward, next, with nimble interchange They pass'd it to each other many a time, Footing the plain, while every youth of all The circus clapp'd his hands, and from beneath The din of stamping feet fill'd all the air. Then, turning to Alcinoüs, thus the wise Ulysses spake. Alcinoüs! mighty King l Illustrious above all Phæacia's sons! Incomparable are ye in the dance, Even as thou said'st. Amazement-fixt I stand! So he, whom hearing, the imperial might Exulted of Alcinoüs, and aloud To his oar-skill'd Phæacians thus he spake. Phæacian Chiefs and Senators, attend! Wisdom beyond the common stint I mark In this our guest; good cause in my account, For which we should present him with a pledge Of hospitality and love. The Chiefs Are twelve, who, highest in command, controul The people, and the thirteenth Chief am I. Bring each a golden talent, with a vest Well-bleach'd, and tunic; gratified with these, The stranger to our banquet shall repair Exulting; bring them all without delay; And let Euryalus by word and gift Appease him, for his speech was unadvised. He ceased, whom all applauded, and at once Each sent his herald forth to bring the gifts, When thus Euryalus his Sire address'd. Alcinoüs! o'er Phæacia's sons supreme! I will appease our guest as thou command'st. This sword shall be his own, the blade all steel, The hilt of silver, and the unsullied sheath Of ivory recent from the carver's hand. A gift like this he shall not need despise. So saying, his silver-studded sword he gave Into his grasp, and courteous, thus began. Hail, honour'd stranger! and if word of mine Have harm'd thee, rashly spoken, let the winds Bear all remembrance of it swift away! May the Gods give thee to behold again Thy wife, and to attain thy native shore, Whence absent long, thou hast so much endured! To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied. Hail also thou, and may the Gods, my friend, Grant thee felicity, and may never want Of this thy sword touch thee in time to come, By whose kind phrase appeased my wrath subsides! He ended, and athwart his shoulders threw The weapon bright-emboss'd. Now sank the sun, And those rich gifts arrived, which to the house Of King Alcinoüs the heralds bore, Alcinoüs sons received them, and beside Their royal mother placed the precious charge. The King then led the way, at whose abode Arrived, again they press'd their lofty thrones, And to Areta thus the monarch spake. Haste, bring a coffer; bring thy best, and store A mantle and a sumptuous vest within; Warm for him, next a brazen bath, by which Refresh'd, and viewing in fair order placed The noble gifts by the Phæacian Lords Conferr'd on him, he may the more enjoy Our banquet, and the bard's harmonious song. I give him also this my golden cup Splendid, elaborate; that, while he lives, What time he pours libation forth to Jove And all the Gods, he may remember me. He ended, at whose words Areta bade Her maidens with dispatch place o'er the fire A tripod ample-womb'd; obedient they Advanced a laver to the glowing hearth, Water infused, and kindled wood beneath. The flames encircling bright the bellied vase, Warm'd soon the flood within. Meantime, the queen Producing from her chamber-stores a chest All-elegant, within it placed the gold And raiment, gifts of the Phæacian Chiefs, With her own gifts, the mantle and the vest, And in wing'd accents to Ulysses said. Now take, thyself, the coffer's lid in charge; Girdle it quickly with a cord, lest loss Befall thee on thy way, while thou perchance Shalt sleep secure on board the sable bark. Which when Ulysses heard, Hero renown'd, Adjusting close the lid, he cast a cord Around it, which with many a mazy knot He tied, by Circe taught him long before. And now, the mistress of the household charge Summon'd him to his bath; glad he beheld The steaming vase, uncustom'd to its use E'er since his voyage from the isle of fair Calypso, although, while a guest with her, Ever familiar with it, as a God. Laved by attendant damsels, and with oil Refresh'd, he put his sumptuous tunic on And mantle, and proceeding from the bath To the symposium, join'd the numerous guests; But, as he pass'd, the Princess all divine Beside the pillars of the portal lost In admiration of his graceful form, Stood, and in accents wing'd him thus address'd. Hail, stranger! at thy native home arrived Remember me, thy first deliverer here. To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied. Nausicaa! daughter of the noble King Alcinoüs! So may Jove, high-thundering mate Of Juno, grant me to behold again My native land, and my delightful home, As, even there, I will present my vows To thee, adoring thee as I adore The Gods themselves, virgin, by whom I live! He said, and on his throne beside the King Alcinoüs sat. And now they portion'd out The feast to all, and charged the cups with wine, And introducing by his hand the bard Phæacia's glory, at the column's side The herald placed Demodocus again. Then, carving forth a portion from the loins Of a huge brawn, of which uneaten still Large part and delicate remain'd, thus spake Ulysses—Herald! bear it to the bard For his regale, whom I will soon embrace In spite of sorrow; for respect is due And veneration to the sacred bard From all mankind, for that the muse inspires Herself his song, and loves the tuneful tribe. He ended, and the herald bore his charge To the old Hero, who with joy received That meed of honour at the bearer's hand. Then, all, at once, assail'd the ready feast, And hunger now, and thirst both satisfied, Thus to Demodocus Ulysses spake. Demodocus! I give thee praise above All mortals, for that either thee the muse Jove's daughter teaches, or the King, himself, Apollo; since thou so record'st the fate, With such clear method, of Achaia's host, Their deeds heroic, and their numerous toils, As thou hadst present been thyself, or learnt From others present there, the glorious tale. Come, then, proceed; that rare invention sing, The horse of wood, which by Minerva's aid Epeus framed, and which Ulysses erst Convey'd into the citadel of Troy With warriors fill'd, who laid all Ilium waste. These things rehearse regular, and myself Will, instant, publish in the ears of all Thy fame, reporting thee a bard to whom Apollo free imparts celestial song. He ended; then Apollo with full force Rush'd on Demodocus, and he began What time the Greeks, first firing their own camp, Steer'd all their galleys from the shore of Troy. Already, in the horse conceal'd, his band Around Ulysses sat; for Ilium's sons Themselves had drawn it to the citadel, And there the mischief stood. Then, strife arose Among the Trojans compassing the horse, And threefold was the doubt; whether to cleave The hollow trunk asunder, or updrawn Aloft, to cast it headlong from the rocks, Or to permit the enormous image, kept Entire, to stand an offering to the Gods, Which was their destined course; for Fate had fix'd Their ruin sure, when once they had received Within their walls that engine huge, in which Sat all the bravest Greecians with the fate Of Ilium charged, and slaughter of her sons. He sang, how, from the horse effused, the Greeks Left their capacious ambush, and the town Made desolate. To others, in his song, He gave the praise of wasting all beside, But told how, fierce as Mars, Ulysses join'd With godlike Menelaus, to the house Flew of Deiphobus; him there engaged In direst fight he sang, and through the aid Of glorious Pallas, conqueror over all. So sang the bard illustrious, at whose song Ulysses melted, and tear after tear Fell on his cheeks. As when a woman weeps, Her husband, who hath fallen in defence Of his own city and his babes before The gates; she, sinking, folds him in her arms, And, gazing on him as he pants and dies, Shrieks at the sight; meantime, the enemy Smiting her shoulders with the spear, to toil Command her and to bondage far away, And her cheek fades with horror at the sound; Ulysses, so, from his moist lids let fall The frequent tear. Unnoticed by the rest Those drops, but not by King Alcinoüs, fell, Who, seated at his side, his heavy sighs Remark'd, and the Phæacians thus spake. Phæacian Chiefs and Senators, attend! Now let Demodocus enjoin his harp Silence, for not alike grateful to all His music sounds; during our feast, and since The bard divine began, continual flow The stranger's sorrows, by remembrance caused Of some great woe which wraps his soul around. Then, let the bard suspend his song, that all (As most befits the occasion,) may rejoice, Both guest and hosts together; since we make This voyage, and these gifts confer, in proof Of hospitality and unfeign'd love, Judging, with all wise men, the stranger-guest And suppliant worthy of a brother's place. And thou conceal not, artfully reserved, What I shall ask, far better plain declared Than smother'd close; who art thou? speak thy name, The name by which thy father, mother, friends And fellow-citizens, with all who dwell Around thy native city, in times past Have known thee; for of all things human none Lives altogether nameless, whether good Or whether bad, but every man receives Even in the moment of his birth, a name. Thy country, people, city, tell; the mark At which my ships, intelligent, shall aim, That they may bear thee thither; for our ships No pilot need or helm, as ships are wont, But know, themselves, our purpose; know beside All cities, and all fruitful regions well Of all the earth, and with dark clouds involved Plough rapid the rough Deep, fearless of harm, (Whate'er betide) and of disastrous wreck. Yet thus, long since, my father I have heard Nausithoüs speaking; Neptune, he would say, Is angry with us, for that safe we bear Strangers of every nation to their home; And he foretold a time when he would smite In vengeance some Phæacian gallant bark Returning after convoy of her charge, And fix her in the sable flood, transform'd Into a mountain, right before the town. So spake my hoary Sire, which let the God At his own pleasure do, or leave undone. But tell me truth, and plainly. Where have been Thy wanderings? in what regions of the earth Hast thou arrived? what nations hast thou seen, What cities? say, how many hast thou found Harsh, savage and unjust? how many, kind To strangers, and disposed to fear the Gods? Say also, from what secret grief of heart Thy sorrows flow, oft as thou hear'st the fate Of the Achaians, or of Ilium sung? That fate the Gods prepared; they spin the thread Of man's destruction, that in after days The bard may make the sad event his theme. Perish'd thy father or thy brother there? Or hast thou at the siege of Ilium lost Father-in-law, or son-in-law? for such Are next and dearest to us after those Who share our own descent; or was the dead Thy bosom-friend, whose heart was as thy own? For worthy as a brother of our love The constant friend and the discrete I deem. BOOK IX. ARGUMENT OF THE NINTH BOOK. Ulysses discovers himself to the Phæacians, and begins the history of his adventures. He destroys Ismarus. city of the Ciconians; arrives among the Lotophagi; and afterwards at the land of the Cyclops. He is imprisoned by Polypheme in his cave, who devours six of his companions; intoxicates the monster with wine, blinds him while he sleeps, and escapes from him. Then answer, thus, Ulysses wise return'd. Alcinoüs! King! illustrious above all Phæacia's sons! pleasant it is to hear A bard like this, sweet as the Gods in song. The world, in my account, no sight affords More gratifying, than a people blest With cheerfulness and peace, a palace throng'd With guests in order ranged, listening to sounds Melodious, and the steaming tables spread With plenteous viands, while the cups, with wine From brimming beakers fill'd, pass brisk around. No lovelier sight know I. But thou, it seems, Thy thoughts hast turn'd to ask me whence my groans And tears, that I may sorrow still the more. What first, what next, what last shall I rehearse, On whom the Gods have shower'd such various woes? Learn first my name, that even in this land Remote I may be known, and that escaped From all adversity, I may requite Hereafter, this your hospitable care At my own home, however distant hence. I am Ulysses, fear'd in all the earth, For subtlest wisdom, and renown'd to heaven, The offspring of Laertes; my abode Is sun-burnt Ithaca; there waving stands The mountain Neritus his numerous boughs, And it is neighbour'd close by clustering isles All populous; thence Samos is beheld, Dulichium, and Zacynthus forest-clad. Flat on the Deep she lies, farthest removed Toward the West, while, situate apart, Her sister islands face the rising day; Rugged she is, but fruitful nurse of sons Magnanimous; nor shall these eyes behold, Elsewhere, an object dear and sweet as she. Calypso, beauteous Goddess, in her grot Detain'd me, wishing me her own espoused; Ææan Circe also, skill'd profound In potent arts, within her palace long Detain'd me, wishing me her own espoused; But never could they warp my constant mind. So much our parents and our native soil Attract us most, even although our lot Be fair and plenteous in a foreign land. But come—my painful voyage, such as Jove Gave me from Ilium, I will now relate. From Troy the winds bore me to Ismarus, City of the Ciconians; them I slew, And laid their city waste; whence bringing forth Much spoil with all their wives, I portion'd it With equal hand, and each received a share. Next, I exhorted to immediate flight My people; but in vain; they madly scorn'd My sober counsel, and much wine they drank, And sheep and beeves slew numerous on the shore. Meantime, Ciconians to Ciconians call'd, Their neighbours summoning, a mightier host And braver, natives of the continent, Expert, on horses mounted, to maintain Fierce fight, or if occasion bade, on foot. Numerous they came as leaves, or vernal flowers At day-spring. Then by the decree of Jove, Misfortune found us. At the ships we stood Piercing each other with the brazen spear, And till the morning brighten'd into noon, Few as we were, we yet withstood them all; But when the sun verged westward, then the Greeks Fell back and the Ciconian host prevail'd. Six warlike Greecians from each galley's crew Perish'd in that dread field; the rest escaped. Thus after loss of many we pursued Our course, yet, difficult as was our flight, Went not till first we had invoked by name Our friends whom the Ciconians had destroy'd. But cloud-assembler Jove assail'd us soon With a tempestuous North-wind; earth alike And sea with storms he overhung, and night Fell fast from heaven. Their heads deep plunging oft Our gallies flew, and rent, and rent again Our tatter'd sail-cloth crackled in the wind. We, fearing instant death, within the barks Our canvas lodged, and toiling strenuous, reach'd At length the continent. Two nights we lay Continual there, and two long days consumed With toil and grief; but when the beauteous morn Bright-hair'd had brought the third day to a close, (Our masts erected, and white sails unfurl'd,) Again we sat on board; meantime, the winds Well managed by the steersman, urged us on. And now, all danger pass'd, I had attain'd My native shore, but, doubling in my course Malea, waves and currents and North-winds Constrain'd me devious to Cythera's isle. Nine days by cruel storms thence was I borne Athwart the fishy Deep, but on the tenth Reach'd the Lotophagi, a race sustain'd On sweetest fruit alone. There quitting ship, We landed and drew water, and the crews Beside the vessels took their evening cheer. When, hasty, we had thus our strength renew'd, I order'd forth my people to inquire (Two I selected from the rest, with whom I join'd an herald, third,) what race of men Might there inhabit. They, departing, mix'd With the Lotophagi; nor hostile aught Or savage the Lotophagi devised Against our friends, but offer'd to their taste The lotus; of which fruit what man soe'er Once tasted, no desire felt he to come With tidings back, or seek his country more, But rather wish'd to feed on lotus still With the Lotophagi, and to renounce All thoughts of home. Them, therefore, I constrain'd Weeping on board, and dragging each beneath The benches, bound him there. Then, all in haste, I urged my people to ascend again Their hollow barks, lest others also, fed With fruit of lotus, should forget their home. They quick embark'd, and on the benches ranged In order, thresh'd with oars the foamy flood. Thence, o'er the Deep proceeding sad, we reach'd The land at length, where, So the Scholium interprets in this place, the word ??????????. giant-sized and free From all constraint of law, the Cyclops dwell. They, trusting to the Gods, plant not, or plough, But earth unsow'd, untill'd, brings forth for them All fruits, wheat, barley, and the vinous grape Large-cluster'd, nourish'd by the showers of Jove. No councils they convene, no laws contrive, But in deep caverns dwell, found on the heads Of lofty mountains, judging each supreme His wife and children, heedless of the rest. In front of the Cyclopean haven lies, A level island, not adjoining close Their land, nor yet remote, woody and rude. There, wild-goats breed numberless, by no foot Of man molested; never huntsman there, Inured to winter's cold and hunger, roams The dreary woods, or mountain-tops sublime; No fleecy flocks dwell there, nor plough is known, But the unseeded and unfurrow'd soil, Year after year a wilderness by man Untrodden, food for blatant goats, supplies. For no ships crimson-prow'd the Cyclops own, Nor naval artizan is there, whose toil Might furnish them with oary barks, by which Subsists all distant commerce, and which bear Man o'er the Deep to cities far remote Who might improve the peopled isle, that seems Not sterile in itself, but apt to yield, In their due season, fruits of every kind. For stretch'd beside the hoary ocean lie Green meadows moist, where vines would never fail; Light is the land, and they might yearly reap The tallest crops, so unctuous is the glebe. Safe is its haven also, where no need Of cable is or anchor, or to lash The hawser fast ashore, but pushing in His bark, the mariner might there abide Till rising gales should tempt him forth again. At bottom of the bay runs a clear stream Issuing from a cove hemm'd all around With poplars; down into that bay we steer'd Amid the darkness of the night, some God Conducting us; for all unseen it lay, Such gloom involved the fleet, nor shone the moon From heaven to light us, veil'd by pitchy clouds. Hence, none the isle descried, nor any saw The lofty surge roll'd on the strand, or ere Our vessels struck the ground; but when they struck, Then, lowering all our sails we disembark'd, And on the sea-beech slept till dawn appear'd. Soon as Aurora, daughter of the dawn, Look'd rosy forth, we with admiring eyes The isle survey'd, roaming it wide around. Meantime, the nymphs, Jove's daughters, roused the goats Bred on the mountains, to supply with food The partners of my toils; then, bringing forth Bows and long-pointed javelins from the ships, Divided all into three separate bands We struck them, and the Gods gave us much prey. Twelve ships attended me, and every ship Nine goats received by lot; myself alone Selected ten. All day, till set of sun, We eating sat goat's flesh, and drinking wine Delicious without stint; for dearth was none Of ruddy wine on board, but much remain'd, With which my people had their jars supplied What time we sack'd Ciconian Ismarus. Thence looking forth toward the neighbour-land Where dwell the Cyclops, rising smoke we saw, And voices heard, their own, and of their flocks. Now sank the sun, and (night o'ershadowing all) We slept along the shore; but when again, The rosy-finger'd daughter of the dawn Look'd forth, my crews convened, I thus began. Companions of my course! here rest ye all, Save my own crew, with whom I will explore This people, whether wild they be, unjust, And to contention given, or well-disposed To strangers, and a race who fear the Gods. So speaking, I embark'd, and bade embark My followers, throwing, quick, the hawsers loose. They, entering at my word, the benches fill'd Well-ranged, and thresh'd with oars the foamy flood. Attaining soon that neighbour-land, we found At its extremity, fast by the sea, A cavern, lofty, and dark-brow'd above With laurels; in that cavern slumbering lay Much cattle, sheep and goats, and a broad court Enclosed it, fenced with stones from quarries hewn, With spiry firs, and oaks of ample bough. Here dwelt a giant vast, who far remote His flocks fed solitary, converse none Desiring, sullen, savage, and unjust. Monster, in truth, he was, hideous in form, Resembling less a man by Ceres' gift Sustain'd, than some aspiring mountain-crag Tufted with wood, and standing all alone. Enjoining, then, my people to abide Fast by the ship which they should closely guard, I went; but not without a goat-skin fill'd With sable wine which I had erst received From Maron, offspring of Evanthes, priest Of Phœbus guardian god of Ismarus, Because through reverence of him, we had saved Himself, his wife and children; for he dwelt Amid the grove umbrageous of his God. He gave me, therefore, noble gifts; from him Seven talents I received of beaten gold, A beaker, argent all, and after these No fewer than twelve jars with wine replete, Rich, unadulterate, drink for Gods; nor knew One servant, male or female, of that wine In all his house; none knew it, save himself, His wife, and the intendant of his stores. Oft as they drank that luscious juice, he slaked A single cup with twenty from the stream, And, even then, the beaker breath'd abroad A scent celestial, which whoever smelt, Thenceforth no pleasure found it to abstain. Charged with an ample goat-skin of this wine I went, and with a wallet well supplied, But felt a sudden presage in my soul That, haply, with terrific force endued, Some savage would appear, strange to the laws And privileges of the human race. Few steps convey'd us to his den, but him We found not; he his flocks pastured abroad. His cavern entering, we with wonder gazed Around on all; his strainers hung with cheese Distended wide; with lambs and kids his penns Close-throng'd we saw, and folded separate The various charge; the eldest all apart, Apart the middle-aged, and the new-yean'd Also apart. His pails and bowls with whey Swam all, neat vessels into which he milk'd. Me then my friends first importuned to take A portion of his cheeses, then to drive Forth from the sheep-cotes to the rapid bark His kids and lambs, and plow the brine again. But me they moved not, happier had they moved! I wish'd to see him, and to gain, perchance, Some pledge of hospitality at his hands, Whose form was such, as should not much bespeak When he appear'd, our confidence or love. Then, kindling fire we offer'd to the Gods, And of his cheeses eating, patient sat Till home he trudged from pasture. Charged he came With dry wood bundled, an enormous load, Fuel by which to sup. Loud crash'd the thorns Which down he cast before the cavern's mouth, To whose interior nooks we trembling flew. At once he drove into his spacious cave His batten'd flock, all those which gave him milk, But all the males, both rams and goats, he left Abroad, excluded from the cavern-yard. Upheaving, next, a rocky barrier huge To his cave's mouth, he thrust it home. That weight Not all the oxen from its place had moved Of twenty and two wains; with such a rock Immense his den he closed. Then down he sat, And as he milk'd his ewes and bleating goats All in their turns, her yeanling gave to each; Coagulating, then, with brisk dispatch, The half of his new milk, he thrust the curd Into his wicker sieves, but stored the rest In pans and bowls—his customary drink. His labours thus perform'd, he kindled, last, His fuel, and discerning us, enquired, Who are ye, strangers? from what distant shore Roam ye the waters? traffick ye? or bound To no one port, wander, as pirates use, At large the Deep, exposing life themselves, And enemies of all mankind beside? He ceased; we, dash'd with terrour, heard the growl Of his big voice, and view'd his form uncouth, To whom, though sore-appall'd, I thus replied. Of Greece are we, and, bound from Ilium home, Have wander'd wide the expanse of ocean, sport For every wind, and driven from our course, Have here arrived; so stood the will of Jove. We boast ourselves of Agamemnon's train, The son of Atreus, at this hour the Chief Beyond all others under heaven renown'd, So great a city he hath sack'd, and slain Such numerous foes; but since we reach, at last, Thy knees, we beg such hospitable fare, Or other gift, as guests are wont to obtain. Illustrious lord! respect the Gods, and us Thy suitors; suppliants are the care of Jove The hospitable; he their wrongs resents, And where the stranger sojourns, there is he. I ceased, when answer thus he, fierce, return'd. Friend! either thou art fool, or hast arrived Indeed from far, who bidd'st me fear the Gods Lest they be wroth. The Cyclops little heeds Jove ægis-arm'd, or all the Powers of Heaven. Our race is mightier far; nor shall myself, Through fear of Jove's hostility, abstain From thee or thine, unless my choice be such. But tell me now. Where touch'd thy gallant bark Our country, on thy first arrival here? Remote, or nigh? for I would learn the truth. So spake he, tempting me; but, artful, thus, I answer'd, penetrating his intent. My vessel, Neptune, Shaker of the shores At yonder utmost promontory dash'd In pieces, hurling her against the rocks With winds that blew right thither from the sea, And I, with these alone, escaped alive. So I, to whom, relentless, answer none He deign'd, but, with his arms extended, sprang Toward my people, of whom seizing two At once, like whelps against his cavern-floor He dash'd them, and their brains spread on the ground. These, piece-meal hewn, for supper he prepared, And, like a mountain-lion, neither flesh Nor entrails left, nor yet their marrowy bones. We, viewing that tremendous sight, upraised Our hands to Jove, all hope and courage lost. When thus the Cyclops had with human flesh Fill'd his capacious belly, and had quaff'd Much undiluted milk, among his flocks Outstretch'd immense, he press'd his cavern-floor. Me, then, my courage prompted to approach The monster with my sword drawn from the sheath, And to transfix him where the vitals wrap The liver; but maturer thoughts forbad. For so, we also had incurr'd a death Tremendous, wanting power to thrust aside The rocky mass that closed his cavern-mouth By force of hand alone. Thus many a sigh Heaving, we watch'd the dawn. But when, at length, Aurora, day-spring's daughter rosy-palm'd Look'd forth, then kindling fire, his flocks he milk'd In order, and her yeanling kid or lamb Thrust under each. When thus he had perform'd His wonted task, two seizing, as before, He slew them for his next obscene regale. His dinner ended, from the cave he drove His fatted flocks abroad, moving with ease That ponderous barrier, and replacing it As he had only closed a quiver's lid. Then, hissing them along, he drove his flocks Toward the mountain, and me left, the while, Deep ruminating how I best might take Vengeance, and by the aid of Pallas win Deathless renown. This counsel pleased me most. Beside the sheep-cote lay a massy club Hewn by the Cyclops from an olive stock, Green, but which dried, should serve him for a staff. To us considering it, that staff appear'd Tall as the mast of a huge trading-bark, Impell'd by twenty rowers o'er the Deep. Such seem'd its length to us, and such its bulk. Part amputating, (an whole fathom's length) I gave my men that portion, with command To shave it smooth. They smooth'd it, and myself, Shaping its blunt extremity to a point, Season'd it in the fire; then covering close The weapon, hid it under litter'd straw, For much lay scatter'd on the cavern-floor. And now I bade my people cast the lot Who of us all should take the pointed brand, And grind it in his eye when next he slept. The lots were cast, and four were chosen, those Whom most I wish'd, and I was chosen fifth. At even-tide he came, his fleecy flocks Pasturing homeward, and compell'd them all Into his cavern, leaving none abroad, Either through some surmise, or so inclined By influence, haply, of the Gods themselves. The huge rock pull'd into his place again At the cave's mouth, he sitting, milk'd his sheep And goats in order, and her kid or lamb Thrust under each; thus, all his work dispatch'd, Two more he seized, and to his supper fell. I then approaching to him, thus address'd The Cyclops, holding in my hand a cup Of ivy-wood, well-charged with ruddy wine. Lo, Cyclops! this is wine. Take this and drink After thy meal of man's flesh. Taste and learn What precious liquor our lost vessel bore. I brought it hither, purposing to make Libation to thee, if to pity inclined Thou wouldst dismiss us home. But, ah, thy rage Is insupportable! thou cruel one! Who, thinkest thou, of all mankind, henceforth Will visit thee guilty of such excess? I ceased. He took and drank, and ????? hugely pleased With that delicious beverage, thus enquired. Give me again, and spare not. Tell me, too, Thy name, incontinent, that I may make Requital, gratifying also thee With somewhat to thy taste. We Cyclops own A bounteous soil, which yields us also wine From clusters large, nourish'd by showers from Jove; But this—oh this is from above—a stream Of nectar and ambrosia, all divine! He ended, and received a second draught, Like measure. Thrice I bore it to his hand, And, foolish, thrice he drank. But when the fumes Began to play around the Cyclops' brain, With show of amity I thus replied. Cyclops! thou hast my noble name enquired, Which I will tell thee. Give me, in return, Thy promised boon, some hospitable pledge. My name is Outis Clarke, who has preserved this name in his marginal version, contends strenuously, and with great reason, that Outis ought not to be translated: and in a passage which he quotes from the Acta eruditorum, we see much fault found with Giphanius and other interpreters of Homer for having translated it. It is certain that in Homer the word is declined not as ?????-?????, which signifies no man, but as ?????-?????, making ????? in the accusative, consequently as a proper name. It is sufficient that the ambiguity was such as to deceive the friends of the Cyclops. Outis is said by some (perhaps absurdly) to have been a name given to Ulysses on account of his having larger ears than common.; Outis I am call'd At home, abroad, wherever I am known. So I; to whom he, savage, thus replied. Outis, when I have eaten all his friends, Shall be my last regale. Be that thy boon. He spake, and downward sway'd, fell resupine, With his huge neck aslant. All-conquering sleep Soon seized him. From his gullet gush'd the wine With human morsels mingled, many a blast Sonorous issuing from his glutted maw. Then thrusting far the spike of olive-wood Into the embers glowing on the hearth, I heated it, and cheer'd my friends, the while, Lest any should, through fear, shrink from his part. But when that stake of olive-wood, though green, Should soon have flamed, for it was glowing hot, I bore it to his side. Then all my aids Around me gather'd, and the Gods infused Heroic fortitude into our hearts. They, seizing the hot stake rasp'd to a point, Bored his eye with it, and myself, advanced To a superior stand, twirl'd it about. As when a shipwright with his wimble bores Tough oaken timber, placed on either side Below, his fellow-artists strain the thong Alternate, and the restless iron spins, So, grasping hard the stake pointed with fire, We twirl'd it in his eye; the bubbling blood Boil'd round about the brand; his pupil sent A scalding vapour forth that singed his brow, And all his eye-roots crackled in the flame. As when the smith an hatchet or large axe Tempering with skill, plunges the hissing blade Deep in cold-water, (whence the strength of steel,) So hiss'd his eye around the olive-wood. The howling monster with his outcry fill'd The hollow rock, and I, with all my aids, Fled terrified. He, plucking forth the spike From his burnt socket, mad with anguish, cast The implement all bloody far away. Then, bellowing, he sounded forth the name Of every Cyclops dwelling in the caves Around him, on the wind-swept mountain-tops; They at his cry flocking from every part, Circled his den, and of his ail enquired. What grievous hurt hath caused thee, Polypheme! Thus yelling to alarm the peaceful ear Of night, and break our slumbers? Fear'st thou lest Some mortal man drive off thy flocks? or fear'st Thyself to die by cunning or by force? Them answer'd then, Polypheme from his cave. Oh, friends! I die, and Outis gives the blow. To whom with accents wing'd his friends without. If no man Outis, as a name, could only denote him who bore it; but as a noun, it signifies no man, which accounts sufficiently for the ludicrous mistake of his brethren. harm thee, but thou art alone, And sickness feel'st, it is the stroke of Jove, And thou must bear it; yet invoke for aid Thy father Neptune, Sovereign of the floods. So saying, they went, and in my heart I laugh'd That by the fiction only of a name, Slight stratagem! I had deceived them all. Then groan'd the Cyclops wrung with pain and grief, And, fumbling with stretch'd hands, removed the rock From his cave's mouth, which done, he sat him down Spreading his arms athwart the pass, to stop Our egress with his flocks abroad; so dull, It seems, he held me, and so ill-advised. I, pondering what means might fittest prove To save from instant death, (if save I might) My people and myself, to every shift Inclined, and various counsels framed, as one Who strove for life, conscious of woe at hand. To me, thus meditating, this appear'd The likeliest course. The rams well-thriven were Thick-fleeced, full-sized, with wool of sable hue. These, silently, with osier twigs on which The Cyclops, hideous monster, slept, I bound, Three in one leash; the intermediate rams Bore each a man, whom the exterior two Preserved, concealing him on either side. Thus each was borne by three, and I, at last, The curl'd back seizing of a ram, (for one I had reserved far stateliest of them all) Slipp'd underneath his belly, and both hands Enfolding fast in his exuberant fleece, Clung ceaseless to him as I lay supine. We, thus disposed, waited with many a sigh The sacred dawn; but when, at length, arisen, Aurora, day-spring's daughter rosy-palm'd Again appear'd, the males of all his flocks Rush'd forth to pasture, and his ewes, the while Stood bleating, unrelieved from the distress Of udders overcharged. Their master, rack'd With pain intolerable, handled yet The backs of all, inquisitive, as they stood, But, gross of intellect, suspicion none Conceived of men beneath their bodies bound. And now (none left beside) the ram approach'd With his own wool burthen'd, and with myself, Whom many a fear molested. Polypheme The giant stroak'd him as he sat, and said, My darling ram! why, latest of the flock Comest thou, whom never, heretofore, my sheep Could leave behind, but stalking at their head, Thou first was wont to crop the tender grass, First to arrive at the clear stream, and first With ready will to seek my sheep-cote here At evening; but, thy practice changed, thou comest, Now last of all. Feel'st thou regret, my ram! Of thy poor master's eye, by a vile wretch Bored out, who overcame me first with wine, And by a crew of vagabonds accursed, Followers of Outis, whose escape from death Shall not be made to day? Ah! that thy heart Were as my own, and that distinct as I Thou could'st articulate, so shouldst thou tell, Where hidden, he eludes my furious wrath. Then, dash'd against the floor his spatter'd brain Should fly, and I should lighter feel my harm From Outis, wretch base-named and nothing-worth. So saying, he left him to pursue the flock. When thus drawn forth, we had, at length, escaped Few paces from the cavern and the court, First, quitting my own ram, I loosed my friends, Then, turning seaward many a thriven ewe Sharp-hoof'd, we drove them swiftly to the ship. Thrice welcome to our faithful friends we came From death escaped, but much they mourn'd the dead. I suffer'd not their tears, but silent shook My brows, by signs commanding them to lift The sheep on board, and instant plow the main. They, quick embarking, on the benches sat Well ranged, and thresh'd with oars the foamy flood; But distant now such length as a loud voice May reach, I hail'd with taunts the Cyclops' ear. Cyclops! when thou devouredst in thy cave With brutal force my followers, thou devour'dst The followers of no timid Chief, or base. Vengeance was sure to recompense that deed Atrocious. Monster! who wast not afraid To eat the guest shelter'd beneath thy roof! Therefore the Gods have well requited thee. I ended; he, exasperate, raged the more, And rending from its hold a mountain-top, Hurl'd it toward us; at our vessel's stern Down came the mass, nigh sweeping in its fall The rudder's head. The ocean at the plunge Of that huge rock, high on his refluent flood Heaved, irresistible, the ship to land. I seizing, quick, our longest pole on board, Back thrust her from the coast, and by a nod In silence given, bid my companions ply Strenuous their oars, that so we might escape. ???????????. ?Olli certamine summo Procumbunt. Virgil.Procumbent, each obey'd, and when, the flood Cleaving The seeming incongruity of this line with line 560, is reconciled by supposing that Ulysses exerted his voice, naturally loud, in an extraordinary manner on this second occasion.See Clarke., we twice that distance had obtain'd, Again I hail'd the Cyclops; but my friends Earnest dissuaded me on every side. Ah, rash Ulysses! why with taunts provoke The savage more, who hath this moment hurl'd A weapon, such as heaved the ship again To land, where death seem'd certain to us all? For had he heard a cry, or but the voice Of one man speaking, he had all our heads With some sharp rock, and all our timbers crush'd Together, such vast force is in his arm. So they, but my courageous heart remain'd Unmoved, and thus again, incensed, I spake. Cyclops! should any mortal man inquire To whom thy shameful loss of sight thou owest, Say, to Ulysses, city-waster Chief, Laertes' son, native of Ithaca. I ceased, and with a groan thus he replied. Ah me! an antient oracle I feel Accomplish'd. Here abode a prophet erst, A man of noblest form, and in his art Unrivall'd, Telemus Eurymedes. He, prophesying to the Cyclops-race, Grew old among us, and presaged my loss Of sight, in future, by Ulysses' hand. I therefore watch'd for the arrival here, Always, of some great Chief, for stature, bulk And beauty praised, and clothed with wonderous might. But now—a dwarf, a thing impalpable, A shadow, overcame me first by wine, Then quench'd my sight. Come hither, O my guest! Return, Ulysses! hospitable cheer Awaits thee, and my prayers I will prefer To glorious Neptune for thy prosperous course; For I am Neptune's offspring, and the God Is proud to be my Sire; he, if he please, And he alone can heal me; none beside Of Powers Immortal, or of men below. He spake, to whom I answer thus return'd. I would that of my life and soul amerced, I could as sure dismiss thee down to Hell, As none shall heal thy eye—not even He. So I; then pray'd the Cyclops to his Sire With hands upraised toward the starry heaven. Hear, Earth-encircler Neptune, azure-hair'd! If I indeed am thine, and if thou boast Thyself my father, grant that never more Ulysses, leveller of hostile towers, Laertes' son, of Ithaca the fair, Behold his native home! but if his fate Decree him yet to see his friends, his house, His native country, let him deep-distress'd Return and late, all his companions lost, Indebted for a ship to foreign aid, And let affliction meet him at his door. He spake, and Ocean's sovereign heard his prayer. Then lifting from the shore a stone of size Far more enormous, o'er his head he whirl'd The rock, and his immeasurable force Exerting all, dismiss'd it. Close behind The ship, nor distant from the rudder's head, Down came the mass. The ocean at the plunge Of such a weight, high on its refluent flood Tumultuous, heaved the bark well-nigh to land. But when we reach'd the isle where we had left Our numerous barks, and where my people sat Watching with ceaseless sorrow our return, We thrust our vessel to the sandy shore, Then disembark'd, and of the Cyclops' sheep Gave equal share to all. To me alone My fellow-voyagers the ram consign'd In distribution, my peculiar meed. Him, therefore, to cloud-girt Saturnian Jove I offer'd on the shore, burning his thighs In sacrifice; but Jove my hallow'd rites Reck'd not, destruction purposing to all My barks, and all my followers o'er the Deep. Thus, feasting largely, on the shore we sat Till even-tide, and quaffing generous wine; But when day fail'd, and night o'ershadow'd all, Then on the shore we slept; and when again Aurora, rosy daughter of the Dawn, Look'd forth, my people, anxious, I enjoin'd To climb their barks, and cast the hawsers loose. They, all obedient, took their seats on board Well-ranged, and thresh'd with oars the foamy flood. Thus, 'scaping narrowly, we roam'd the Deep With aching hearts and with diminish'd crews. BOOK X. ARGUMENT OF THE TENTH BOOK. Ulysses, in pursuit of his narrative, relates his arrival at the island of Æolus, his departure thence, and the unhappy occasion of his return thither. The monarch of the winds dismisses him at last with much asperity. He next tells of his arrival among the Læstrygonians, by whom his whole fleet, together with their crews, are destroyed, his own ship and crew excepted. Thence he is driven to the island of Circe. By her the half of his people are transformed into swine. Assisted by Mercury, he resists her enchantments himself, and prevails with the Goddess to recover them to their former shape. In consequence of Circe's instructions, after having spent a complete year in her palace, he prepares for a voyage to the infernal regions. We came to the Æolian isle; there dwells Æolus, son of Hippotas, beloved By the Immortals, in an isle afloat. A brazen wall impregnable on all sides Girds it, and smooth its rocky coast ascends. His children in his own fair palace born, Are twelve; six daughters, and six blooming sons. He gave his daughters to his sons to wife; They with their father hold perpetual feast And with their royal mother, still supplied With dainties numberless; the sounding dome Is fill'd with savoury odours all the day, And with their consorts chaste at night they sleep On stateliest couches with rich arras spread. Their city and their splendid courts we reach'd. A month complete he, friendly, at his board Regaled me, and enquiry made minute Of Ilium's fall, of the Achaian fleet, And of our voyage thence. I told him all. But now, desirous to embark again, I ask'd dismission home, which he approved, And well provided for my prosperous course. He gave me, furnish'd by a bullock flay'd In his ninth year, a bag; every rude blast Which from its bottom turns the Deep, that bag Imprison'd held; for him Saturnian Jove Hath officed arbiter of all the winds, To rouse their force, or calm them, at his will. He gave me them on board my bark, so bound With silver twine that not a breath escaped, Then order'd gentle Zephyrus to fill Our sails propitious. Order vain, alas! So fatal proved the folly of my friends. Nine days continual, night and day we sail'd, And on the tenth my native land appear'd. Not far remote my Ithacans I saw Fires kindling on the coast; but me with toil Worn, and with watching, gentle sleep subdued; For constant I had ruled the helm, nor given That charge to any, fearful of delay. Then, in close conference combined, my crew Each other thus bespake—He carries home Silver and gold from Æolus received, Offspring of Hippotas, illustrious Chief;— And thus a mariner the rest harangued. Ye Gods! what city or what land soe'er Ulysses visits, how he is beloved By all, and honour'd! many precious spoils He homeward bears from Troy; but we return, (We who the self-same voyage have perform'd,) With empty hands. Now also he hath gain'd This pledge of friendship from the Kings of winds. But come—be quick—search we the bag, and learn What stores of gold and silver it contains. So he, whose mischievous advice prevail'd. They loosed the bag; forth issued all the winds, And caught by tempests o'er the billowy waste, Weeping they flew, far, far from Ithaca. I then, awaking, in my noble mind Stood doubtful, whether from my vessel's side Immersed to perish in the flood, or calm To endure my sorrows, and consent to live. I calm endured them; but around my head Winding my mantle, lay'd me down below, While adverse blasts bore all my fleet again To the Æolian isle; then groan'd my people. We disembark'd and drew fresh water there, And my companions, at their galley's sides All seated took repast; short meal we made, When, with an herald and a chosen friend I sought once more the hall of Æolus. Him banquetting with all his sons we found, And with his spouse; we, entering, on the floor Of his wide portal sat, whom they amazed Beheld, and of our coming thus enquired. Return'd? Ulysses! by what adverse Power Repulsed hast thou arrived; we sent thee hence Well-fitted forth to reach thy native isle, Thy palace, or what place soe'er thou would'st. So they—to whom, heart-broken, I replied. My worthless crew have wrong'd me, nor alone My worthless crew, but sleep ill-timed, as much. Yet heal, O friends, my hurt; the power is yours! So I their favour woo'd. Mute sat the sons, But thus their father answer'd. Hence—be gone— Leave this our isle, thou most obnoxious wretch Of all mankind. I should, myself, transgress, Receiving here, and giving conduct hence To one detested by the Gods as thou. Away—for hated by the Gods thou comest. So saying, he sent me from his palace forth, Groaning profound; thence, therefore, o'er the Deep We still proceeded sorrowful, our force Exhausting ceaseless at the toilsome oar, And through our own imprudence, hopeless now Of other furtherance to our native isle. Six days we navigated, day and night, The briny flood, and on the seventh reach'd The city erst by Lamus built sublime, Proud Læstrigonia, with the distant gates. It is supposed by Eustathius that the pastures being infested by gad-flies and other noxious insects in the day-time, they drove their sheep a-field in the morning, which by their wool were defended from them, and their cattle in the evening, when the insects had withdrawn. It is one of the few passages in Homer that must lie at the mercy of conjecture.The herdsman, there, driving his cattle home, Summons the shepherd with his flocks abroad. The sleepless there might double wages earn, Attending, now, the herds, now, tending sheep, For the night-pastures, and the pastures grazed By day, close border, both, the city-walls. To that illustrious port we came, by rocks Uninterrupted flank'd on either side Of towering height, while prominent the shores And bold, converging at the haven's mouth Leave narrow pass. We push'd our galleys in, Then moor'd them side by side; for never surge There lifts its head, or great or small, but clear We found, and motionless, the shelter'd flood. Myself alone, staying my bark without, Secured her well with hawsers to a rock At the land's point, then climb'd the rugged steep, And spying stood the country. Labours none Of men or oxen in the land appear'd, Nor aught beside saw we, but from the earth Smoke rising; therefore of my friends I sent Before me two, adding an herald third, To learn what race of men that country fed. Departing, they an even track pursued Made by the waggons bringing timber down From the high mountains to the town below. Before the town a virgin bearing forth Her ewer they met, daughter of him who ruled The Læstrygonian race, Antiphatas. Descending from the gate she sought the fount Artacia; for their custom was to draw From that pure fountain for the city's use. Approaching they accosted her, and ask'd What King reign'd there, and over whom he reign'd. She gave them soon to know where stood sublime The palace of her Sire; no sooner they The palace enter'd, than within they found, In size resembling an huge mountain-top, A woman, whom they shudder'd to behold. She forth from council summon'd quick her spouse Antiphatas, who teeming came with thoughts Of carnage, and arriving seized at once A Greecian, whom, next moment, he devoured. With headlong terrour the surviving two Fled to the ships. Then sent Antiphatas His voice through all the town, and on all sides, Hearing that cry, the Læstrygonians flock'd Numberless, and in size resembling more The giants than mankind. They from the rocks Cast down into our fleet enormous stones, A strong man's burthen each; dire din arose Of shatter'd galleys and of dying men, Whom spear'd like fishes to their home they bore, A loathsome prey. While them within the port They slaughter'd, I, (the faulchion at my side Drawn forth) cut loose the hawser of my ship, And all my crew enjoin'd with bosoms laid Prone on their oars, to fly the threaten'd woe. They, dreading instant death, tugg'd resupine Together, and the galley from beneath Those The word has the authority of Shakespeare, and signifies overhanging. beetling rocks into the open sea Shot gladly; but the rest all perish'd there. Proceeding thence, we sigh'd, and roam'd the waves, Glad that we lived, but sorrowing for the slain. We came to the Ææan isle; there dwelt The awful Circe, Goddess amber hair'd, Deep skill'd in magic song, sister by birth Of the all-wise Æætes; them the Sun, Bright luminary of the world, begat On Perse, daughter of Oceanus. Our vessel there, noiseless, we push'd to land Within a spacious haven, thither led By some celestial Power. We disembark'd, And on the coast two days and nights entire Extended lay, worn with long toil, and each The victim of his heart-devouring woes. Then with my spear, and with my faulchion arm'd, I left the ship to climb with hasty steps An airy height, thence, hoping to espie Some works of man, or hear perchance, a voice. Exalted on a rough rock's craggy point I stood, and on the distant plain, beheld Smoke which from Circe's palace through the gloom Of trees and thickets rose. That smoke discern'd, I ponder'd next if thither I should haste, Seeking intelligence. Long time I mused, But chose at last, as my discreter course, To seek the sea-beach and my bark again, And, when my crew had eaten, to dispatch Before me, others, who should first enquire. But, ere I yet had reach'd my gallant bark, Some God with pity viewing me alone In that untrodden solitude, sent forth An antler'd stag full-sized into my path. His woodland pastures left, he sought the stream, For he was thirsty, and already parch'd By the sun's heat. Him issuing from his haunt, Sheer through the back beneath his middle spine I wounded, and the lance sprang forth beyond. Moaning he fell, and in the dust expired. Then treading on his breathless trunk, I pluck'd My weapon forth, which leaving there reclined, I tore away the osiers with my hands And sallows green, and to a fathom's length Twisting the gather'd twigs into a band, Bound fast the feet of my enormous prey, And, slinging him athwart my neck, repair'd Toward my sable bark, propp'd on my lance, Which now to carry shoulder'd as before Surpass'd my power, so bulky was the load. Arriving at the ship, there I let fall My burthen, and with pleasant speech and kind, Man after man addressing, cheer'd my crew. My friends! we suffer much, but shall not seek The shades, ere yet our destined hour arrive. Behold a feast! and we have wine on board;— Pine not with needless famine; rise and eat. I spake; they readily obey'd, and each Issuing at my word abroad, beside The galley stood, admiring, as he lay, The stag, for of no common bulk was he. At length, their eyes gratified to the full With that glad spectacle, they laved their hands, And preparation made of noble cheer. That day complete, till set of sun, we spent Feasting deliciously without restraint, And quaffing generous wine: but when the sun Went down, and darkness overshadow'd all, Extended then on Ocean's bank we lay; And when Aurora, daughter of the dawn, Look'd rosy forth, convening all my crew To council, I arose, and thus began. My fellow-voyagers, however worn With numerous hardships, hear! for neither West Know we, nor East, where rises, or where sets The all-enlight'ning sun. But let us think, If thought perchance may profit us, of which Small hope I see! for when I lately climb'd Yon craggy rock, plainly I could discern The land encompass'd by the boundless Deep. The isle is flat, and in the midst I saw Dun smoke ascending from an oaken bower. So I, whom hearing, they all courage lost, And at remembrance of Antiphatas The Læstrygonian, and the Cyclops' deeds, Ferocious feeder on the flesh of man, Mourn'd loud and wept, but tears could nought avail. Then, numbering man by man, I parted them In equal portions, and assign'd a Chief To either band, myself to these, to those Godlike Eurylochus. This done, we cast The lots into the helmet, and at once Forth sprang the lot of bold Eurylochus. He went, and with him of my people march'd Twenty and two, all weeping; nor ourselves Wept less, at separation from our friends. Low in a vale, but on an open spot, They found the splendid house of Circe, built With hewn and polish'd stones; compass'd she dwelt By lions on all sides and mountain-wolves Tamed by herself with drugs of noxious powers. Nor were they mischievous, but as my friends Approach'd, arising on their hinder feet, Paw'd them in blandishment, and wagg'd the tail. As, when from feast he rises, dogs around Their master fawn, accustom'd to receive The sop conciliatory from his hand, Around my people, so, those talon'd wolves And lions fawn'd. They, terrified, that troop Of savage monsters horrible beheld. And now before the Goddess' gates arrived, They heard the voice of Circe singing sweet Within, while, busied at the loom, she wove An ample web immortal, such a work Transparent, graceful, and of bright design As hands of Goddesses alone produce. Thus then Polites, Prince of men, the friend Highest in my esteem, the rest bespake. Ye hear the voice, comrades, of one who weaves An ample web within, and at her task So sweetly chaunts that all the marble floor Re-echoes; human be she or divine I doubt, but let us call, that we may learn. He ceased; they call'd; soon issuing at the sound, The Goddess open'd wide her splendid gates, And bade them in; they, heedless, all complied, All save Eurylochus, who fear'd a snare. She, introducing them, conducted each To a bright throne, then gave them Pramnian wine, With grated cheese, pure meal, and honey new, But medicated with her poisonous drugs Their food, that in oblivion they might lose The wish of home. She gave them, and they drank,— When smiting each with her enchanting wand, She shut them in her sties. In head, in voice, In body, and in bristles they became All swine, yet intellected as before, And at her hand were dieted alone With acorns, chestnuts, and the cornel-fruit, Food grateful ever to the groveling swine. Back flew Eurylochus toward the ship, To tell the woeful tale; struggling to speak Yet speechless, there he stood, his heart transfixt With anguish, and his eyes deluged with tears. Me boding terrours occupied. At length, When, gazing on him, all had oft inquired, He thus rehearsed to us the dreadful change. Renown'd Ulysses! as thou badest, we went Through yonder oaks; there, bosom'd in a vale, But built conspicuous on a swelling knoll With polish'd rock, we found a stately dome. Within, some Goddess or some woman wove An ample web, carolling sweet the while. They call'd aloud; she, issuing at the voice, Unfolded, soon, her splendid portals wide, And bade them in. Heedless they enter'd, all, But I remain'd, suspicious of a snare. Ere long the whole band vanish'd, none I saw Thenceforth, though, seated there, long time I watch'd. He ended; I my studded faulchion huge Athwart my shoulder cast, and seized my bow, Then bade him lead me thither by the way Himself had gone; but with both hands my knees He clasp'd, and in wing'd accents sad exclaim'd. My King! ah lead me not unwilling back, But leave me here; for confident I judge That neither thou wilt bring another thence, Nor come thyself again. Haste—fly we swift With these, for we, at least, may yet escape. So he, to whom this answer I return'd. Eurylochus! abiding here, eat thou And drink thy fill beside the sable bark; I go; necessity forbids my stay. So saying, I left the galley and the shore. But ere that awful vale entering, I reach'd The palace of the sorceress, a God Met me, the bearer of the golden wand, Hermes. He seem'd a stripling in his prime, His cheeks cloathed only with their earliest down, For youth is then most graceful; fast he lock'd His hand in mine, and thus, familiar, spake. Unhappy! whither, wandering o'er the hills, Stranger to all this region, and alone, Goest thou? Thy people—they within the walls Are shut of Circe, where as swine close-pent She keeps them. Comest thou to set them free? I tell thee, never wilt thou thence return Thyself, but wilt be prison'd with the rest. Yet hearken—I will disappoint her wiles, And will preserve thee. Take this precious drug; Possessing this, enter the Goddess' house Boldly, for it shall save thy life from harm. Lo! I reveal to thee the cruel arts Of Circe; learn them. She will mix for thee A potion, and will also drug thy food With noxious herbs; but she shall not prevail By all her power to change thee; for the force Superior of this noble plant, my gift, Shall baffle her. Hear still what I advise. When she shall smite thee with her slender rod, With faulchion drawn and with death-threatening looks Rush on her; she will bid thee to her bed Affrighted; then beware. Decline not thou Her love, that she may both release thy friends, And may with kindness entertain thyself. But force her swear the dreaded oath of Heaven That she will other mischief none devise Against thee, lest she strip thee of thy might, And quenching all thy virtue, make thee vile. So spake the Argicide, and from the earth That plant extracting, placed it in my hand, Then taught me all its powers. Black was the root, Milk-white the blossom; Moly is its name In heaven; not easily by mortal man Dug forth, but all is easy to the Gods. Then, Hermes through the island-woods repair'd To heaven, and I to Circe's dread abode, In gloomy musings busied as I went. Within the vestibule arrived, where dwelt The beauteous Goddess, staying there my steps I call'd aloud; she heard me, and at once Issuing, threw her splendid portals wide, And bade me in. I follow'd, heart-distress'd. Leading me by the hand to a bright throne With ardent studs embellish'd, and beneath Foot-stool'd magnificent, she made me sit. Then mingling for me in a golden cup My beverage, she infused a drug, intent On mischief; but when I had drunk the draught Unchanged, she smote me with her wand, and said. Hence—seek the sty. There wallow with thy friends. She spake; I drawing from beside my thigh My faulchion keen, with death-denouncing looks Rush'd on her; she with a shrill scream of fear Ran under my raised arm, seized fast my knees And in wing'd accents plaintive thus began. Who? whence? thy city and thy birth declare. Amazed I see thee with that potion drench'd Yet unenchanted; never man before Once pass'd it through his lips, and lived the same; But in thy breast a mind inhabits, proof Against all charms. Come then—I know thee well. Thou art Ulysses artifice-renown'd, Of whose arrival here in his return From Ilium, Hermes of the golden wand Was ever wont to tell me. Sheath again Thy sword, and let us on my bed reclined, Mutual embrace, that we may trust thenceforth Each other, without jealousy or fear. The Goddess spake, to whom I thus replied. O Circe! canst thou bid me meek become And gentle, who beneath thy roof detain'st My fellow-voyagers transform'd to swine? And fearing my escape, invitest thou me Into thy bed, with fraudulent pretext Of love, that there enfeebling by thy arts My noble spirit, thou may'st make me vile? No—trust me—never will I share thy bed Till first, oh Goddess, thou consent to swear That dread all-binding oath, that other harm Against myself thou wilt imagine none. I spake. She swearing as I bade, renounced All evil purpose, and (her solemn oath Concluded,) I ascended, next, her bed Magnificent. Meantime, four graceful nymphs Attended on the service of the house, Her menials, from the fountains sprung and groves, And from the sacred streams that seek the sea. Of these, one cast fine linen on the thrones, Which, next, with purple arras rich she spread; Another placed before the gorgeous seats Bright tables, and set on baskets of gold. The third, an argent beaker fill'd with wine Delicious, which in golden cups she served; The fourth brought water, which she warm'd within An ample vase, and when the simmering flood Sang in the tripod, led me to a bath, And laved me with the pleasant stream profuse Pour'd o'er my neck and body, till my limbs, Refresh'd, all sense of lassitude resign'd. When she had bathed me, and with limpid oil Anointed me, and clothed me in a vest And mantle, next, she led me to a throne Of royal state, with silver studs emboss'd, And footstool'd soft beneath; then came a nymph With golden ewer charged and silver bowl, Who pour'd pure water on my hands, and placed The polish'd board before me, which with food Various, selected from her present stores, The cateress spread, then, courteous, bade me eat. But me it pleased not; with far other thoughts My spirit teem'd, on vengeance more intent. Soon, then, as Circe mark'd me on my seat Fast-rooted, sullen, nor with outstretch'd hands Deigning to touch the banquet, she approach'd, And in wing'd accents suasive thus began. Why sits Ulysses like the Dumb, dark thoughts His only food? loaths he the touch of meat, And taste of wine? Thou fear'st, as I perceive, Some other snare, but idle is that fear, For I have sworn the inviolable oath. She ceased, to whom this answer I return'd. How can I eat? what virtuous man and just O Circe! could endure the taste of wine Or food, till he should see his prison'd friends Once more at liberty? If then thy wish That I should eat and drink be true, produce My captive people; let us meet again. So I; then Circe, bearing in her hand Her potent rod, went forth, and opening wide The door, drove out my people from the sty, In bulk resembling brawns of the ninth year. They stood before me; she through all the herd Proceeding, with an unctuous antidote Anointed each, and at the wholesome touch All shed the swinish bristles by the drug Dread Circe's former magic gift, produced. Restored at once to manhood, they appear'd More vigorous far, and sightlier than before. They knew me, and with grasp affectionate Hung on my hand. Tears follow'd, but of joy, And with loud cries the vaulted palace rang. Even the awful Goddess felt, herself, Compassion, and, approaching me, began. Læertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd! Hence to the shore, and to thy gallant bark; First, hale her safe aground, then, hiding all Your arms and treasures in the caverns, come Thyself again, and hither lead thy friends, So spake the Goddess, and my generous mind Persuaded; thence repairing to the beach, I sought my ship; arrived, I found my crew Lamenting miserably, and their cheeks With tears bedewing ceaseless at her side. As when the calves within some village rear'd Behold, at eve, the herd returning home From fruitful meads where they have grazed their fill, No longer in the stalls contain'd, they rush With many a frisk abroad, and, blaring oft, With one consent all dance their dams around; So they, at sight of me, dissolved in tears Of rapturous joy, and each his spirit felt With like affections warm'd as he had reach'd Just then his country, and his city seen, Fair Ithaca, where he was born and rear'd. Then in wing'd accents tender thus they spake. Noble Ulysses! thy appearance fills Our soul with transports, such as we should feel Arrived in safety on our native shore. Speak—say how perish'd our unhappy friends? So they; to whom this answer mild I gave. Hale we our vessel first ashore, and hide In caverns all our treasures and our arms, Then, hasting hence, follow me, and ere long Ye shall behold your friends, beneath the roof Of Circe banquetting and drinking wine Abundant, for no dearth attends them there. So I; whom all with readiness obey'd, All save Eurylochus; he sought alone To stay the rest, and, eager, interposed. Ah whither tend we, miserable men? Why covet ye this evil, to go down To Circe's palace? she will change us all To lions, wolves, or swine, that we may guard Her palace, by necessity constrain'd. So some were prisoners of the Cyclops erst, When, led by rash Ulysses, our lost friends Intruded needlessly into his cave, And perish'd by the folly of their Chief. He spake, whom hearing, occupied I stood In self-debate, whether, my faulchion keen Forth-drawing from beside my sturdy thigh, To tumble his lopp'd head into the dust, Although he were my kinsman in the bonds Of close affinity; but all my friends As with one voice, thus gently interposed. Noble Ulysses! we will leave him here Our vessel's guard, if such be thy command, But us lead thou to Circe's dread abode. So saying, they left the galley, and set forth Climbing the coast; nor would Eurylochus Beside the hollow bark remain, but join'd His comrades, by my dreadful menace awed. Meantime the Goddess, busily employ'd, Bathed and refresh'd my friends with limpid oil, And clothed them. We, arriving, found them all Banquetting in the palace; there they met; These ask'd and those rehearsed the wondrous tale, And the recital made, all wept aloud Till the wide dome resounded. Then approach'd The graceful Goddess, and address'd me thus. Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd! Provoke ye not each other, now, to tears. I am not ignorant, myself, how dread Have been your woes, both on the fishy Deep, And on the land by force of hostile powers. But come—Eat now, and drink ye wine, that so Your freshen'd spirit may revive, and ye Courageous grow again, as when ye left The rugged shores of Ithaca, your home. For now, through recollection, day by day, Of all your pains and toils, ye are become Spiritless, strengthless, and the taste forget Of pleasure, such have been your numerous woes. She spake, whose invitation kind prevail'd, And won us to her will. There then we dwelt The year complete, fed with delicious fare Day after day, and quaffing generous wine. But when (the year fulfill'd) the circling hours Their course resumed, and the successive months With all their tedious days were spent, my friends, Summoning me abroad, thus greeted me. Sir! recollect thy country, if indeed The fates ordain thee to revisit safe That country, and thy own glorious abode. So they; whose admonition I received Well-pleased. Then, all the day, regaled we sat At Circe's board with savoury viands rare, And quaffing richest wine; but when, the sun Declining, darkness overshadow'd all, Then, each within the dusky palace took Custom'd repose, and to the Goddess' bed Magnificent ascending, there I urged My earnest suit, which gracious she received, And in wing'd accents earnest thus I spake. O Circe! let us prove thy promise true; Dismiss us hence. My own desires, at length, Tend homeward vehement, and the desires No less of all my friends, who with complaints Unheard by thee, wear my sad heart away. So I; to whom the Goddess in return. Laertes' noble son, Ulysses famed For deepest wisdom! dwell not longer here, Thou and thy followers, in my abode Reluctant. But your next must be a course Far different; hence departing, ye must seek The dreary house of Ades and of dread Persephone, there to consult the Seer Theban Tiresias, prophet blind, but blest With faculties which death itself hath spared. To him alone, of all the dead, Hell's Queen Gives still to prophecy, while others flit Mere forms, the shadows of what once they were. She spake, and by her words dash'd from my soul All courage; weeping on the bed I sat, Reckless of life and of the light of day. But when, with tears and rolling to and fro Satiate, I felt relief, thus I replied. O Circe! with what guide shall I perform This voyage, unperform'd by living man? I spake, to whom the Goddess quick replied. Brave Laertiades! let not the fear To want a guide distress thee. Once on board, Your mast erected, and your canvass white Unfurl'd, sit thou; the breathing North shall waft Thy vessel on. But when ye shall have cross'd The broad expanse of Ocean, and shall reach The oozy shore, where grow the poplar groves And fruitless willows wan of Proserpine, Push thither through the gulfy Deep thy bark, And, landing, haste to Pluto's murky abode. There, into Acheron runs not alone Dread Pyriphlegethon, but Cocytus loud, From Styx derived; there also stands a rock, At whose broad base the roaring rivers meet. There, thrusting, as I bid, thy bark ashore, O Hero! scoop the soil, opening a trench Ell-broad on every side; then pour around Libation consecrate to all the dead, First, milk with honey mixt, then luscious wine, Then water, sprinkling, last, meal over all. Next supplicate the unsubstantial forms, Fervently of the dead, vowing to slay, (Return'd to Ithaca) in thy own house, An heifer barren yet, fairest and best Of all thy herds, and to enrich the pile With delicacies such as please the shades; But, in peculiar, to Tiresias vow A sable ram, noblest of all thy flocks. When thus thou hast propitiated with prayer All the illustrious nations of the dead, Next thou shalt sacrifice to them a ram And sable ewe, turning the face of each Right toward Erebus, and look thyself, Meantime, askance toward the river's course. Souls numerous, soon, of the departed dead Will thither flock; then strenuous urge thy friends, Flaying the victims which thy ruthless steel Hath slain, to burn them, and to sooth by prayer Illustrious Pluto and dread Proserpine. While thus is done, thou seated at the foss, Faulchion in hand, chase thence the airy forms Afar, nor suffer them to approach the blood, Till with Tiresias thou have first conferr'd. Then, glorious Chief! the Prophet shall himself Appear, who will instruct thee, and thy course Delineate, measuring from place to place Thy whole return athwart the fishy flood. While thus she spake, the golden dawn arose, When, putting on me my attire, the nymph Next, cloath'd herself, and girding to her waist With an embroider'd zone her snowy robe Graceful, redundant, veil'd her beauteous head. Then, ranging the wide palace, I aroused My followers, standing at the side of each— Up! sleep no longer! let us quick depart, For thus the Goddess hath, herself, advised. So I, whose early summons my brave friends With readiness obey'd. Yet even thence I brought not all my crew. There was a youth, Youngest of all my train, Elpenor; one Not much in estimation for desert In arms, nor prompt in understanding more, Who overcharged with wine, and covetous Of cooler air, high on the palace-roof Of Circe slept, apart from all the rest. Awaken'd by the clamour of his friends Newly arisen, he also sprang to rise, And in his haste, forgetful where to find The deep-descending stairs, plunged through the roof. With neck-bone broken from the vertebræ Outstretch'd he lay; his spirit sought the shades. Then, thus to my assembling friends I spake. Ye think, I doubt not, of an homeward course, But Circe points me to the drear abode Of Proserpine and Pluto, to consult The spirit of Tiresias, Theban seer. I ended, and the hearts of all alike Felt consternation; on the earth they sat Disconsolate, and plucking each his hair, Yet profit none of all their sorrow found. But while we sought my galley on the beach With tepid tears bedewing, as we went, Our cheeks, meantime the Goddess to the shore Descending, bound within the bark a ram And sable ewe, passing us unperceived. For who hath eyes that can discern a God Going or coming, if he shun the view? BOOK XI. ARGUMENT OF THE ELEVENTH BOOK. Ulysses relates to Alcinoüs his voyage to the infernal regions, his conference there with the prophet Tiresias concerning his return to Ithaca, and gives him an account of the heroes, heroines, and others whom he saw there. Arriving on the shore, and launching, first, Our bark into the sacred Deep, we set Our mast and sails, and stow'd secure on board The ram and ewe, then, weeping, and with hearts Sad and disconsolate, embark'd ourselves. And now, melodious Circe, nymph divine, Sent after us a canvass-stretching breeze, Pleasant companion of our course, and we (The decks and benches clear'd) untoiling sat, While managed gales sped swift the bark along. All day, with sails distended, o'er the Deep She flew, and when the sun at length, declined, And twilight dim had shadow'd all the ways, Approach'd the bourn of Ocean's vast profound. The city, there, of the Cimmerians stands With clouds and darkness veil'd, on whom the sun Deigns not to look with his beam-darting eye, Or when he climbs the starry arch, or when Earthward he slopes again his westering Milton. wheels, But sad night canopies the woeful race. We haled the bark aground, and landing there The ram and sable ewe, journey'd beside The Deep, till we arrived where Circe bade. Here, Perimedes' son Eurylochus Held fast the destined sacrifice, while I Scoop'd with my sword the soil, opening a trench Ell-broad on every side, then pour'd around Libation consecrate to all the dead, First, milk with honey mixt, then luscious wine, Then water, sprinkling, last, meal over all. This done, adoring the unreal forms And shadows of the dead, I vow'd to slay, (Return'd to Ithaca) in my own abode, An heifer barren yet, fairest and best Of all my herds, and to enrich the pile With delicacies, such as please the shades. But, in peculiar, to the Theban seer, I vow'd a sable ram, largest and best Of all my flocks. When thus I had implored With vows and prayer, the nations of the dead, Piercing the victims next, I turn'd them both To bleed into the trench; then swarming came From Erebus the shades of the deceased, Brides, youths unwedded, seniors long with woe Oppress'd, and tender girls yet new to grief. Came also many a warrior by the spear In battle pierced, with armour gore-distain'd, And all the multitude around the foss Stalk'd shrieking dreadful; me pale horror seized. I next, importunate, my people urged, Flaying the victims which myself had slain, To burn them, and to supplicate in prayer Illustrious Pluto and dread Proserpine. Then down I sat, and with drawn faulchion chased The ghosts, nor suffer'd them to approach the blood, Till with Tiresias I should first confer. The spirit, first, of my companion came, Elpenor; for no burial honours yet Had he received, but we had left his corse In Circe's palace, tombless, undeplored, Ourselves by pressure urged of other cares. Touch'd with compassion seeing him, I wept, And in wing'd accents brief him thus bespake. Elpenor! how camest thou into the realms Of darkness? Hast thou, though on foot, so far Outstripp'd my speed, who in my bark arrived? So I, to whom with tears he thus replied. Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd! Fool'd by some dæmon and the intemperate bowl, I perish'd in the house of Circe; there The deep-descending steps heedless I miss'd, And fell precipitated from the roof. With neck-bone broken from the vertebræ Outstretch'd I lay; my spirit sought the shades. But now, by those whom thou hast left at home, By thy Penelope, and by thy sire, The gentle nourisher of thy infant growth, And by thy only son Telemachus I make my suit to thee. For, sure, I know That from the house of Pluto safe return'd, Thou shalt ere long thy gallant vessel moor At the Ææan isle. Ah! there arrived Remember me. Leave me not undeplored Nor uninhumed, lest, for my sake, the Gods In vengeance visit thee; but with my arms (What arms soe'er I left) burn me, and raise A kind memorial of me on the coast, Heap'd high with earth; that an unhappy man May yet enjoy an unforgotten name. Thus do at my request, and on my hill Funereal, plant the oar with which I row'd, While yet I lived a mariner of thine. He spake, to whom thus answer I return'd. Poor youth! I will perform thy whole desire. Thus we, there sitting, doleful converse held, With outstretch'd faulchion, I, guarding the blood, And my companion's shadowy semblance sad Meantime discoursing me on various themes. The soul of my departed mother, next, Of Anticleia came, daughter of brave Autolycus; whom, when I sought the shores Of Ilium, I had living left at home. Seeing her, with compassion touch'd, I wept, Yet even her, (although it pain'd my soul) Forbad, relentless, to approach the blood, Till with Tiresias I should first confer. Then came the spirit of the Theban seer Himself, his golden sceptre in his hand, Who knew me, and, enquiring, thus began. Why, hapless Chief! leaving the cheerful day, Arrivest thou to behold the dead and this Unpleasant land? but, from the trench awhile Receding, turn thy faulchion keen away, That I may drink the blood, and tell thee truth. He spake; I thence receding, deep infix'd My sword bright-studded in the sheath again. The noble prophet then, approaching, drank The blood, and satisfied, address'd me thus. Thou seek'st a pleasant voyage home again, Renown'd Ulysses! but a God will make That voyage difficult; for, as I judge, Thou wilt not pass by Neptune unperceived, Whose anger follows thee, for that thou hast Deprived his son the Cyclops of his eye. At length, however, after numerous woes Endured, thou may'st attain thy native isle, If thy own appetite thou wilt controul And theirs who follow thee, what time thy bark Well-built, shall at Thrinacia's The shore of Sicily, commonly called Trinacria, but euphonicè by Homer, Thrinacia. shore arrive, Escaped from perils of the gloomy Deep. There shall ye find grazing the flocks and herds Of the all-seeing and all-hearing Sun, Which, if attentive to thy safe return, Thou leave unharm'd, though after numerous woes Ye may at length arrive in Ithaca. But if thou violate them, I denounce Destruction on thy ship and all thy band, And though thyself escape, late shalt thou reach Thy home and The expression is used by Milton, and signifies—Beset with many difficulties. hard-bested, in a strange bark, All thy companions lost; trouble beside Awaits thee there, for thou shalt find within Proud suitors of thy noble wife, who waste Thy substance, and with promised spousal gifts Ceaseless solicit her to wed; yet well Shalt thou avenge all their injurious deeds. That once perform'd, and every suitor slain Either by stratagem, or face to face In thy own palace, bearing, as thou goest, A shapely oar, journey, till thou hast found A people who the sea know not, nor eat Food salted; they trim galley crimson-prow'd Have ne'er beheld, nor yet smooth-shaven oar, With which the vessel wing'd scuds o'er the waves. Well thou shalt know them; this shall be the sign— When thou shalt meet a traveller, who shall name The oar on thy broad shoulder borne, a van Mistaking the oar for a corn-van. A sure indication of his ignorance of maritime concerns., There, deep infixing it within the soil, Worship the King of Ocean with a bull, A ram, and a lascivious boar, then seek Thy home again, and sacrifice at home An hecatomb to the Immortal Gods, Adoring each duly, and in his course. So shalt thou die in peace a gentle death, Remote from Ocean; it shall find thee late, In soft serenity of age, the Chief Of a blest people.—I have told thee truth. He spake, to whom I answer thus return'd. Tiresias! thou, I doubt not, hast reveal'd The ordinance of heaven. But tell me, Seer! And truly. I behold my mother's shade; Silent she sits beside the blood, nor word Nor even look vouchsafes to her own son. How shall she learn, prophet! that I am her's? So I, to whom Tiresias quick replied. The course is easy. Learn it, taught by me. What shade soe'er, by leave from thee obtain'd, Shall taste the blood, that shade will tell thee truth; The rest, prohibited, will all retire. When thus the spirit of the royal Seer Had his prophetic mind reveal'd, again He enter'd Pluto's gates; but I unmoved Still waited till my mother's shade approach'd; She drank the blood, then knew me, and in words Wing'd with affection, plaintive, thus began. My son! how hast thou enter'd, still alive, This darksome region? Difficult it is For living man to view the realms of death. Broad rivers roll, and awful floods between, But chief, the Ocean, which to pass on foot, Or without ship, impossible is found. Hast thou, long-wandering in thy voyage home From Ilium, with thy ship and crew arrived, Ithaca and thy consort yet unseen? She spake, to whom this answer I return'd. My mother! me necessity constrain'd To Pluto's dwelling, anxious to consult Theban Tiresias; for I have not yet Approach'd Achaia, nor have touch'd the shore Of Ithaca, but suffering ceaseless woe Have roam'd, since first in Agamemnon's train I went to combat with the sons of Troy. But speak, my mother, and the truth alone; What stroke of fate slew thee? Fell'st thou a prey To some slow malady? or by the shafts Of gentle Dian suddenly subdued? Speak to me also of my antient Sire, And of Telemachus, whom I left at home; Possess I still unalienate and safe My property, or hath some happier Chief Admittance free into my fortunes gain'd, No hope subsisting more of my return? The mind and purpose of my wedded wife Declare thou also. Dwells she with our son Faithful to my domestic interests, Or is she wedded to some Chief of Greece? I ceased, when thus the venerable shade. Not so; she faithful still and patient dwells Thy roof beneath; but all her days and nights Devoting sad to anguish and to tears. Thy fortunes still are thine; Telemachus Cultivates, undisturb'd, thy land, and sits At many a noble banquet, such as well Beseems the splendour of his princely state, For all invite him. At his farm retired Thy father dwells, nor to the city comes For aught; nor bed, nor furniture of bed, Furr'd cloaks or splendid arras he enjoys, But, with his servile hinds all winter sleeps In ashes and in dust at the hearth-side, Coarsely attired; again, when summer comes, Or genial autumn, on the fallen leaves In any nook, not curious where, he finds An humble couch among his fruitful vines. There, stretch'd forlorn, nourishing grief, he weeps Thy lot, enfeebled now by numerous years. So perish'd I; such fate I also found; Me, neither the right-aiming archeress struck, Diana, with her gentle shafts, nor me Distemper slew, my limbs by slow degrees But sure, bereaving of their little life; But long regret, tender solicitude, And recollection of thy kindness past, These, my Ulysses! fatal proved to me. She said; I, ardent wish'd to clasp the shade Of my departed mother; thrice I sprang Toward her, by desire impetuous urged, And thrice she flitted from between my arms Light as a passing shadow or a dream. Then, pierced by keener grief, in accents wing'd With filial earnestness I thus replied. My mother, why elud'st thou my attempt To clasp thee, that even here, in Pluto's realm, We might to full satiety indulge Our grief enfolded in each other's arms? Hath Proserpine, alas! only dispatch'd A shadow to me, to augment my woe? Then, instant, thus the venerable form. Ah, son! thou most afflicted of mankind! On thee, Jove's daughter, Proserpine, obtrudes No airy semblance vain; but such the state And nature is of mortals once deceased. For they nor muscle have, nor flesh, nor bone; All those (the spirit from the body once Divorced) the violence of fire consumes. And, like a dream, the soul flies swift away. But haste thou back to light, and taught thyself These sacred truths, hereafter teach thy spouse. Thus mutual we conferr'd. Then, thither came, Encouraged forth by royal Proserpine, Shades female numerous, all who consorts, erst, Or daughters were of mighty Chiefs renown'd. About the sable blood frequent they swarm'd. But I, considering sat, how I might each Interrogate, and thus resolved. My sword Forth drawing from beside my sturdy thigh, Firm I prohibited the ghosts to drink The blood together; they successive came; Each told her own distress; I question'd all. There, first, the high-born Tyro I beheld; She claim'd Salmoneus as her sire, and wife Was once of Cretheus, son of Æolus. Enamour'd of Enipeus, stream divine, Loveliest of all that water earth, beside His limpid current she was wont to stray, When Ocean's God, (Enipeus' form assumed) Within the eddy-whirling river's mouth Embraced her; there, while the o'er-arching flood, Uplifted mountainous, conceal'd the God And his fair human bride, her virgin zone He loosed, and o'er her eyes sweet sleep diffused. His amorous purpose satisfied, he grasp'd Her hand, affectionate, and thus he said. Rejoice in this my love, and when the year. Shall tend to consummation of its course, Thou shalt produce illustrious twins, for love Immortal never is unfruitful love. Rear them with all a mother's care; meantime, Hence to thy home. Be silent. Name it not. For I am Neptune, Shaker of the shores. So saying, he plunged into the billowy Deep. She, pregnant grown, Pelias and Neleus bore, Both, valiant ministers of mighty Jove. In wide-spread Iäolchus Pelias dwelt, Of numerous flocks possess'd; but his abode Amid the sands of Pylus Neleus chose. To Cretheus wedded next, the lovely nymph Yet other sons, Æson and Pheres bore, And Amythaon of equestrian fame. I, next, the daughter of Asopus saw, Antiope; she gloried to have known The embrace of Jove himself, to whom she brought A double progeny, Amphion named And Zethus; they the seven-gated Thebes Founded and girded with strong towers, because, Though puissant Heroes both, in spacious Thebes Unfenced by towers, they could not dwell secure. Alcmena, next, wife of Amphitryon I saw; she in the arms of sovereign Jove The lion-hearted Hercules conceived, And, after, bore to Creon brave in fight His daughter Megara, by the noble son Unconquer'd of Amphitryon espoused. The beauteous Epicaste By the Tragedians called—Jocasta. saw I then, Mother of Oedipus, who guilt incurr'd Prodigious, wedded unintentional To her own son; his father first he slew, Then wedded her, which soon the Gods divulged. He, under vengeance of offended heaven, In pleasant Thebes dwelt miserable, King Of the Cadmean race; she to the gates Of Ades brazen-barr'd despairing went, Self-strangled by a cord fasten'd aloft To her own palace-roof, and woes bequeath'd (Such as the Fury sisters execute Innumerable) to her guilty son. There also saw I Chloris, loveliest fair, Whom Neleus woo'd and won with spousal gifts Inestimable, by her beauty charm'd. She youngest daughter was of Iasus' son, Amphion, in old time a sovereign prince In Minuëian Orchomenus, And King of Pylus. Three illustrious sons She bore to Neleus, Nestor, Chromius, And Periclymenus the wide-renown'd, And, last, produced a wonder of the earth, Pero, by every neighbour prince around In marriage sought; but Neleus her on none Deign'd to bestow, save only on the Chief Who should from Phylace drive off the beeves (Broad-fronted, and with jealous care secured) Of valiant Iphicles. One undertook That task alone, a prophet high in fame, Melampus; but the Fates fast bound him there In rigorous bonds by rustic hands imposed. At length (the year, with all its months and days Concluded, and the new-born year begun) Illustrious Iphicles released the seer, Iphicles had been informed by the Oracles, that he should have no children till instructed by a prophet how to obtain them; a service which Melampus had the good fortune to render him.Grateful for all the oracles resolved, Till then obscure. So stood the will of Jove. Next, Leda, wife of Tyndarus, I saw, Who bore to Tyndarus a noble pair, Castor the bold, and Pollux cestus-famed. They prisoners in the fertile womb of earth, Though living, dwell, and even there from Jove High privilege gain; alternate they revive And die, and dignity partake divine. The consort of Aloëus, next, I view'd, Iphimedeia; she the embrace profess'd Of Neptune to have shared, to whom she bore Two sons; short-lived they were, but godlike both, Otus and Ephialtes far-renown'd. Orion sole except, all-bounteous Earth Ne'er nourish'd forms for beauty or for size To be admired as theirs; in his ninth year Each measured, broad, nine cubits, and the height Was found nine ells of each. Against the Gods Themselves they threaten'd war, and to excite The din of battle in the realms above. To the Olympian summit they essay'd To heave up Ossa, and to Ossa's crown Branch-waving Pelion; so to climb the heavens. Nor had they failed, maturer grown in might, To accomplish that emprize, but them the son Apollo. Of radiant-hair'd Latona and of Jove Slew both, ere yet the down of blooming youth Thick-sprung, their cheeks or chins had tufted o'er. Phædra I also there, and Procris saw, And Ariadne for her beauty praised, Whose sire was all-wise Minos. Theseus her From Crete toward the fruitful region bore Of sacred Athens, but enjoy'd not there, For, first, she perish'd by Diana's shafts In Dia, Bacchus Bacchus accused her to Diana of having lain with Theseus in his temple, and the Goddess punish'd her with death. witnessing her crime. Mæra and Clymene I saw beside, And odious Eriphyle, who received The price in gold of her own husband's life. But all the wives of Heroes whom I saw, And all their daughters can I not relate; Night, first, would fail; and even now the hour Calls me to rest either on board my bark, Or here; meantime, I in yourselves confide, And in the Gods to shape my conduct home. He ceased; the whole assembly silent sat, Charm'd into ecstasy by his discourse Throughout the twilight hall, till, at the last, Areta ivory-arm'd them thus bespake. Phæacians! how appears he in your eyes This stranger, graceful as he is in port, In stature noble, and in mind discrete? My guest he is, but ye all share with me That honour; him dismiss not, therefore, hence With haste, nor from such indigence withhold Supplies gratuitous; for ye are rich, And by kind heaven with rare possessions blest. The Hero, next, Echeneus spake, a Chief Now antient, eldest of Phæacia's sons. Your prudent Queen, my friends, speaks not beside Her proper scope, but as beseems her well. Her voice obey; yet the effect of all Must on Alcinoüs himself depend. To whom Alcinoüs, thus, the King, replied. I ratify the word. So shall be done, As surely as myself shall live supreme O'er all Phæacia's maritime domain. Then let the guest, though anxious to depart, Wait till the morrow, that I may complete The whole donation. His safe conduct home Shall be the general care, but mine in chief, To whom dominion o'er the rest belongs. Him answer'd, then, Ulysses ever-wise. Alcinoüs! Prince! exalted high o'er all Phæacia's sons! should ye solicit, kind, My stay throughout the year, preparing still My conduct home, and with illustrious gifts Enriching me the while, even that request Should please me well; the wealthier I return'd, The happier my condition; welcome more And more respectable I should appear In every eye, to Ithaca restored. To whom Alcinoüs answer thus return'd. Ulysses! viewing thee, no fears we feel Lest thou, at length, some false pretender prove, Or subtle hypocrite, of whom no few Disseminated o'er its face the earth Sustains, adepts in fiction, and who frame Fables, where fables could be least surmised. Thy phrase well turn'd, and thy ingenuous mind Proclaim thee different far, who hast in strains Musical as a poet's voice, the woes Rehearsed of all thy Greecians, and thy own. But say, and tell me true. Beheld'st thou there None of thy followers to the walls of Troy Slain in that warfare? Lo! the night is long— A night of utmost length; nor yet the hour Invites to sleep. Tell me thy wondrous deeds, For I could watch till sacred dawn, couldst thou So long endure to tell me of thy toils. Then thus Ulysses, ever-wise, replied. Alcinoüs! high exalted over all Phæacia's sons! the time suffices yet For converse both and sleep, and if thou wish To hear still more, I shall not spare to unfold More pitiable woes than these, sustain'd By my companions, in the end destroy'd; Who saved from perils of disastrous war At Ilium, perish'd yet in their return, Victims of a pernicious woman's Probably meaning Helen. crime. Now, when chaste Proserpine had wide dispersed Those female shades, the spirit sore distress'd Of Agamemnon, Atreus' son, appear'd; Encircled by a throng, he came; by all Who with himself beneath Ægisthus' roof Their fate fulfill'd, perishing by the sword. He drank the blood, and knew me; shrill he wail'd And querulous; tears trickling bathed his cheeks, And with spread palms, through ardour of desire, He sought to enfold me fast, but vigour none, Or force, as erst, his agile limbs inform'd. I, pity-moved, wept at the sight, and him, In accents wing'd by friendship, thus address'd. Ah glorious son of Atreus, King of men! What hand inflicted the all-numbing stroke Of death on thee? Say, didst thou perish sunk By howling tempests irresistible Which Neptune raised, or on dry land by force Of hostile multitudes, while cutting off Beeves from the herd, or driving flocks away, Or fighting for Achaia's daughters, shut Within some city's bulwarks close besieged? I ceased, when Agamemnon thus replied. Ulysses, noble Chief, Laertes' son For wisdom famed! I neither perish'd sunk By howling tempests irresistible Which Neptune raised, nor on dry land received From hostile multitudes the fatal blow, But me Ægisthus slew; my woeful death Confederate with my own pernicious wife He plotted, with a show of love sincere Bidding me to his board, where as the ox Is slaughter'd at his crib, he slaughter'd me. Such was my dreadful death; carnage ensued Continual of my friends slain all around, Numerous as boars bright-tusk'd at nuptial feast Or feast convivial of some wealthy Chief. Thou hast already witness'd many a field With warriors overspread, slain one by one, But that dire scene had most thy pity moved, For we, with brimming beakers at our side, And underneath full tables, bleeding lay. Blood floated all the pavement. Then the cries Of Priam's daughter sounded in my ears Most pitiable of all, Cassandra's cries, Whom Clytemnestra close beside me slew. Expiring as I lay, I yet essay'd To grasp my faulchion, but the traitoress quick Withdrew herself, nor would vouchsafe to close My languid eyes, or prop my drooping chin Even in the moment when I sought the shades. So that the thing breathes not, ruthless and fell As woman once resolved on such a deed Detestable, as my base wife contrived, The murther of the husband of her youth. I thought to have return'd welcome to all, To my own children and domestic train; But she, past measure profligate, hath pour'd Shame on herself, on women yet unborn, And even on the virtuous of her sex. He ceased, to whom, thus, answer I return'd. Gods! how severely hath the Thunderer plagued The house of Atreus, even from the first, By female counsels! we for Helen's sake Have numerous died, and Clytemnestra framed While thou wast far remote, this snare for thee! So I, to whom Atrides thus replied. Thou, therefore, be not pliant overmuch To woman; trust her not with all thy mind, But half disclose to her, and half conceal. Yet, from thy consort's hand no bloody death, My friend, hast thou to fear; for passing wise Icarius' daughter is, far other thoughts, Intelligent, and other plans, to frame. Her, going to the wars we left a bride New-wedded, and the boy hung at her breast, Who, man himself, consorts ere now with men A prosperous youth; his father, safe restored To his own Ithaca, shall see him soon, And he shall clasp his father in his arms As nature bids; but me, my cruel one Indulged not with the dear delight to gaze On my Orestes, for she slew me first. This is, surely, one of the most natural strokes to be found in any poet. Convinced, for a moment, by the virtues of Penelope, he mentions her with respect; but recollecting himself suddenly, involves even her in his general ill opinion of the sex, begotten in him by the crimes of Clytemnestra.But listen; treasure what I now impart. Steer secret to thy native isle; avoid Notice; for woman merits trust no more. Now tell me truth. Hear ye in whose abode My son resides? dwells he in Pylus, say, Or in Orchomenos, or else beneath My brother's roof in Sparta's wide domain? For my Orestes is not yet a shade. So he, to whom I answer thus return'd. Atrides, ask not me. Whether he live, Or have already died, I nothing know; Mere words are vanity, and better spared. Thus we discoursing mutual stood, and tears Shedding disconsolate. The shade, meantime, Came of Achilles, Peleus' mighty son; Patroclus also, and Antilochus Appear'd, with Ajax, for proportion just And stature tall, (Pelides sole except) Distinguish'd above all Achaia's sons. The soul of swift Æacides at once Knew me, and in wing'd accents thus began. Brave Laertiades, for wiles renown'd! What mightier enterprize than all the past Hath made thee here a guest? rash as thou art! How hast thou dared to penetrate the gloom Of Ades, dwelling of the shadowy dead, Semblances only of what once they were? He spake, to whom I, answering, thus replied. O Peleus' son! Achilles! bravest far Of all Achaia's race! I here arrived Seeking Tiresias, from his lips to learn, Perchance, how I might safe regain the coast Of craggy Ithaca; for tempest-toss'd Perpetual, I have neither yet approach'd Achaia's shore, or landed on my own. But as for thee, Achilles! never man Hath known felicity like thine, or shall, Whom living we all honour'd as a God, And who maintain'st, here resident, supreme Controul among the dead; indulge not then, Achilles, causeless grief that thou hast died. I ceased, and answer thus instant received. Renown'd Ulysses! think not death a theme Of consolation; I had rather live The servile hind for hire, and eat the bread Of some man scantily himself sustain'd, Than sovereign empire hold o'er all the shades. But come—speak to me of my noble boy; Proceeds he, as he promised, brave in arms, Or shuns he war? Say also hast thou heard Of royal Peleus? shares he still respect Among his numerous Myrmidons, or scorn In Hellas and in Phthia, for that age Predominates in his enfeebled limbs? For help is none in me; the glorious sun No longer sees me such, as when in aid Of the Achaians I o'erspread the field Of spacious Troy with all their bravest slain. Another most beautiful stroke of nature. Ere yet Ulysses has had opportunity to answer, the very thought that Peleus may possibly be insulted, fires him, and he takes the whole for granted. Thus is the impetuous character of Achilles sustained to the last moment.Oh might I, vigorous as then, repair For one short moment to my father's house, They all should tremble; I would show an arm, Such as should daunt the fiercest who presumes To injure him, or to despise his age. Achilles spake, to whom I thus replied. Of noble Peleus have I nothing heard; But I will tell thee, as thou biddest, the truth Unfeign'd of Neoptolemus thy son; For him, myself, on board my hollow bark From Scyros to Achaia's host convey'd. Oft as in council under Ilium's walls We met, he ever foremost was in speech, Nor spake erroneous; Nestor and myself Except, no Greecian could with him compare. Oft, too, as we with battle hemm'd around Troy's bulwarks from among the mingled crowd Thy son sprang foremost into martial act, Inferior in heroic worth to none. Beneath him numerous fell the sons of Troy In dreadful fight, nor have I power to name Distinctly all, who by his glorious arm Exerted in the cause of Greece, expired. Yet will I name Eurypylus, the son Of Telephus, an Hero whom his sword Of life bereaved, and all around him strew'd The plain with his Cetean warriors, won To Ilium's side by bribes ??????? ?????? ?????—Priam is said to have influenced by gifts the wife and mother of Eurypylus, to persuade him to the assistance of Troy, he being himself unwilling to engage. The passage through defect of history has long been dark, and commentators have adapted different senses to it, all conjectural. The Ceteans are said to have been a people of Mysia, of which Eurypylus was King. to women given. Save noble Memnon only, I beheld No Chief at Ilium beautiful as he. Again, when we within the horse of wood Framed by Epeüs sat, an ambush chosen Of all the bravest Greeks, and I in trust Was placed to open or to keep fast-closed The hollow fraud; then every Chieftain there And Senator of Greece wiped from his cheeks The tears, and tremors felt in every limb; But never saw I changed to terror's hue His ruddy cheeks, no tears, wiped he away, But oft he press'd me to go forth, his suit With prayers enforcing, griping hard his hilt And his brass-burthen'd spear, and dire revenge Denouncing, ardent, on the race of Troy. At length when we had sack'd the lofty town Of Priam, laden with abundant spoils He safe embark'd, neither by spear or shaft Aught hurt, or in close fight by faulchion's edge, As oft in war befalls, where wounds are dealt Promiscuous, at the will of fiery Mars. So I; then striding large, the spirit thence Withdrew of swift Æacides, along The hoary ???? ????????? ???????—Asphodel was planted on the graves, and around the tombs of the deceased, and hence the supposition, that the Stygian plain was cloathed with asphodel. mead pacing with joy elate That I had blazon'd bright his son's renown. The other souls of men by death dismiss'd Stood mournful by, sad uttering each his woes; The soul alone I saw standing remote Of Telamonian Ajax, still incensed That in our public contest for the arms Worn by Achilles, and by Thetis thrown Into dispute, my claim had strongest proved, Troy and Minerva judges of the cause. Disastrous victory! which I could wish Not to have won, since for that armour's sake The earth hath cover'd Ajax, in his form And martial deeds superior far to all The Greecians, Peleus' matchless son except. I, seeking to appease him, thus began. O Ajax, son of glorious Telamon! Canst thou remember, even after death, Thy wrath against me, kindled for the sake Of those pernicious arms? arms which the Gods Ordain'd of such dire consequence to Greece, Which caused thy death, our bulwark! Thee we mourn With grief perpetual, nor the death lament Of Peleus' son, Achilles, more than thine. Yet none is blameable; Jove evermore With bitterest hate pursued Achaia's host, And he ordain'd thy death. Hero! approach, That thou may'st hear the words with which I seek To sooth thee; let thy long displeasure cease! Quell all resentment in thy generous breast! I spake; nought answer'd he, but sullen join'd His fellow ghosts; yet, angry as he was, I had prevail'd even on him to speak, Or had, at least, accosted him again, But that my bosom teem'd with strong desire Urgent to see yet others of the dead. There saw I Minos, offspring famed of Jove; His golden sceptre in his hand, he sat Judge of the dead; they, pleading each in turn His cause, some stood, some sat, filling the house Whose spacious folding gates are never closed. Orion next, huge ghost, engaged my view, Droves urging o'er the grassy mead of beasts Which he had slain, himself, on the wild hills, With strong club arm'd of ever-during brass. There also Tityus on the ground I saw Extended, offspring of the glorious earth; Nine acres he o'erspread, and, at his side Station'd, two vultures on his liver prey'd, Scooping his entrails; nor sufficed his hands To fray them thence; for he had sought to force Latona, illustrious concubine of Jove, What time the Goddess journey'd o'er the rocks Of Pytho into pleasant Panopeus. Next, suffering grievous torments, I beheld Tantalus; in a pool he stood, his chin Wash'd by the wave; thirst-parch'd he seem'd, but found Nought to assuage his thirst; for when he bow'd His hoary head, ardent to quaff, the flood Vanish'd absorb'd, and at his feet, adust The soil appear'd, dried, instant, by the Gods. Tall trees, fruit-laden, with inflected heads Stoop'd to him, pears, pomegranates, apples bright, The luscious fig, and unctuous olive smooth: Which when with sudden grasp he would have seized, Winds whirl'd them high into the dusky clouds. There, too, the hard-task'd Sisyphus I saw, ?????????? must have this sense interpreted by what follows. To attempt to make the English numbers expressive as the Greek, is a labour like that of Sisyphus. The Translator has done what he could.Thrusting before him, strenuous, a vast rock. With hands and feet struggling, he shoved the stone Up to a hill-top; but the steep well-nigh Vanquish'd, by some It is now, perhaps, impossible to ascertain with precision what Homer meant by the word ????????, which he uses only here, and in the next book, where it is the name of Scylla's dam. —???????—is also of very doubtful explication. great force, repulsed, the mass Rush'd again obstinate down to the plain. Again stretch'd prone, severe he toil'd, the sweat Bathed all his weary limbs, and his head reek'd. The might of Hercules I, next, survey'd; His semblance; for himself their banquet shares With the Immortal Gods, and in his arms Enfolds neat-footed Hebe, daughter fair Of Jove, and of his golden-sandal'd spouse. Around him, clamorous as birds, the dead Swarm'd turbulent; he gloomy-brow'd as night, With uncased bow and arrow on the string Peer'd terrible from side to side, as one Ever in act to shoot; a dreadful belt He bore athwart his bosom, thong'd with gold. There, broider'd shone many a stupendous form, Bears, wild-boars, lions with fire-flashing eyes, Fierce combats, battles, bloodshed, homicide. The artist, author of that belt, none such Before, produced, or after. Me his eye No sooner mark'd, than knowing me, in words By sorrow quick suggested, he began. Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd! Ah, hapless Hero! thou art, doubtless, charged, Thou also, with some arduous labour, such As in the realms of day I once endured. Son was I of Saturnian Jove, yet woes Immense sustain'd, subjected to a King Inferior far to me, whose harsh commands Enjoin'd me many a terrible exploit. He even bade me on a time lead hence The dog, that task believing above all Impracticable; yet from Ades him I dragg'd reluctant into light, by aid Of Hermes, and of Pallas azure-eyed. So saying, he penetrated deep again The abode of Pluto; but I still unmoved There stood expecting, curious, other shades To see of Heroes in old time deceased. And now, more ancient worthies still, and whom I wish'd, I had beheld, Pirithoüs And Theseus, glorious progeny of Gods, But nations, first, numberless of the dead Came shrieking hideous; me pale horror seized, Lest awful Proserpine should thither send The Gorgon-head from Ades, sight abhorr'd! I, therefore, hasting to the vessel, bade My crew embark, and cast the hawsers loose. They, quick embarking, on the benches sat.

BOOK XII. ARGUMENT OF THE TWELFTH BOOK. Ulysses, pursuing his narrative, relates his return from the shades to Circe's island, the precautions given him by that Goddess, his escape from the Sirens, and from Scylla and Charybdis; his arrival in Sicily, where his companions, having slain and eaten the oxen of the Sun, are afterward shipwrecked and lost; and concludes the whole with an account of his arrival, alone, on the mast of his vessel at the island of Calypso. And now, borne seaward from the river-stream Of the Oceanus we plow'd again The spacious Deep, and reach'd the Ææan isle, Where, daughter of the dawn, Aurora takes Her choral sports, and whence the sun ascends. We, there arriving, thrust our bark aground On the smooth beach, then landed, and on shore Reposed, expectant of the sacred dawn. But soon as day-spring's daughter rosy-palm'd Look'd forth again, sending my friends before, I bade them bring Elpenor's body down From the abode of Circe to the beach. Then on the utmost headland of the coast We timber fell'd, and sorrowing o'er the dead, His funeral rites water'd with tears profuse. The dead consumed, and with the dead his arms, We heap'd his tomb, and the sepulchral post Erecting, fix'd his shapely oar aloft. Thus, punctual, we perform'd; nor our return From Ades knew not Circe, but attired In haste, ere long arrived, with whom appear'd Her female train with plenteous viands charged, And bright wine rosy-red. Amidst us all Standing, the beauteous Goddess thus began. Ah miserable! who have sought the shades Alive! while others of the human race Die only once, appointed twice to die! Come—take ye food; drink wine; and on the shore All day regale, for ye shall hence again At day-spring o'er the Deep; but I will mark Myself your future course, nor uninform'd Leave you in aught, lest through some dire mistake, By sea or land new miseries ye incur. The Goddess spake, whose invitation kind We glad accepted; thus we feasting sat Till set of sun, and quaffing richest wine; But when the sun went down and darkness fell, My crew beside the hawsers slept, while me The Goddess by the hand leading apart, First bade me sit, then, seated opposite, Enquired, minute, of all that I had seen, And I, from first to last, recounted all. Then thus the awful Goddess in return. Thus far thy toils are finish'd. Now attend! Mark well my words, of which the Gods will sure Themselves remind thee in the needful hour. First shalt thou reach the Sirens; they the hearts Enchant of all who on their coast arrive. The wretch, who unforewarn'd approaching, hears The Sirens' voice, his wife and little-ones Ne'er fly to gratulate his glad return; But him the Sirens sitting in the meads Charm with mellifluous song, while all around The bones accumulated lie of men Now putrid, and the skins mouldering away. But, pass them thou, and lest thy people hear Those warblings, ere thou yet approach, fill all Their ears with wax moulded between thy palms; But as for thee—thou hear them if thou wilt. Yet let thy people bind thee to the mast Erect, encompassing thy feet and arms With cordage well-secured to the mast-foot, So shalt thou, raptured, hear the Sirens' song. But if thou supplicate to be released, Or give such order, then, with added cords Let thy companions bind thee still the more. When thus thy people shall have safely pass'd The Sirens by, think not from me to learn What course thou next shalt steer; two will occur; Deliberate chuse: I shall describe them both. Here vaulted rocks impend, dash'd by the waves Immense of Amphitrite azure-eyed; The blessed Gods those rocks, Erratic, call. Birds cannot pass them safe; no, not the doves Which his ambrosia bear to Father Jove, But even of those doves the slippery rock Proves fatal still to one, for which the God Supplies another, lest the number fail. No ship, what ship soever there arrives, Escapes them, but both mariners and planks Whelm'd under billows of the Deep, or, caught By fiery tempests, sudden disappear. Those rocks the billow-cleaving bark alone, The Argo, further'd by the vows of all, Pass'd safely, sailing from Ææta's isle; Nor she had pass'd, but surely dash'd had been On those huge rocks, but that, propitious still To Jason, Juno sped her safe along. These rocks are two; one lifts his summit sharp High as the spacious heavens, wrapt in dun clouds Perpetual, which nor autumn sees dispersed Nor summer, for the sun shines never there; No mortal man might climb it or descend, Though twice ten hands and twice ten feet he own'd, For it is levigated as by art. Down scoop'd to Erebus, a cavern drear Yawns in the centre of its western side; Pass it, renown'd Ulysses! but aloof So far, that a keen arrow smartly sent Forth from thy bark should fail to reach the cave. There Scylla dwells, and thence her howl is heard Tremendous; shrill her voice is as the note Of hound new-whelp'd, but hideous her aspect, Such as no mortal man, nor even a God Encountering her, should with delight survey. Her feet are twelve, all fore-feet; six her necks Of hideous length, each clubb'd into a head Terrific, and each head with fangs is arm'd In triple row, thick-planted, stored with death. Plunged to her middle in the hollow den She lurks, protruding from the black abyss Her heads, with which the ravening monster dives In quest of dolphins, dog-fish, or of prey More bulky, such as in the roaring gulfs Of Amphitrite without end abounds. It is no seaman's boast that e'er he slipp'd Her cavern by, unharm'd. In every mouth She bears upcaught a mariner away. The other rock, Ulysses, thou shalt find Humbler, a bow-shot only from the first; On this a wild fig grows broad-leaved, and here Charybdis dire ingulfs the sable flood. Each day she thrice disgorges, and each day Thrice swallows it. Ah! well-forewarn'd beware What time she swallows, that thou come not nigh, For not himself, Neptune, could snatch thee thence. Close passing Scylla's rock, shoot swift thy bark Beyond it, since the loss of six alone Is better far than shipwreck made of all. So Circe spake, to whom I thus replied. Tell me, O Goddess, next, and tell me true! If, chance, from fell Charybdis I escape, May I not also save from Scylla's force My people, should the monster threaten them? I said, and quick the Goddess in return. Unhappy! can exploits and toils of war Still please thee? yield'st not to the Gods themselves? She is no mortal, but a deathless pest, Impracticable, savage, battle-proof. Defence is vain; flight is thy sole resource. For should'st thou linger putting on thy arms Beside the rock, beware, lest darting forth Her numerous heads, she seize with every mouth A Greecian, and with others, even thee. Pass therefore swift, and passing, loud invoke Cratais, mother of this plague of man, Who will forbid her to assail thee more. Thou, next, shall reach Thrinacia; there, the beeves And fatted flocks graze numerous of the Sun; Seven herds; as many flocks of snowy fleece; Fifty in each; they breed not, neither die, Nor are they kept by less than Goddesses, Lampetia fair, and Phäethusa, both By nymph Neæra to Hyperion borne. Them, soon as she had train'd them to an age Proportion'd to that charge, their mother sent Into Thrinacia, there to dwell and keep Inviolate their father's flocks and herds. If, anxious for a safe return, thou spare Those herds and flocks, though after much endured, Ye may at last your Ithaca regain; But should'st thou violate them, I foretell Destruction of thy ship and of thy crew, And though thyself escape, thou shalt return Late, in ill plight, and all thy friends destroy'd. She ended, and the golden morning dawn'd. Then, all-divine, her graceful steps she turn'd Back through the isle, and at the beach arrived, I summon'd all my followers to ascend The bark again, and cast the hawsers loose. They, at my voice, embarking, fill'd in ranks The seats, and rowing, thresh'd the hoary flood. And now, melodious Circe, nymph divine, Sent after us a canvas-stretching breeze, Pleasant companion of our course, and we (The decks and benches clear'd) untoiling sat, While managed gales sped swift the bark along. Then, with dejected heart, thus I began. Oh friends! (for it is needful that not one Or two alone the admonition hear Of Circe, beauteous prophetess divine,) To all I speak, that whether we escape Or perish, all may be at least forewarn'd. She bids us, first, avoid the dangerous song Of the sweet Sirens and their flowery meads. Me only she permits those strains to hear; But ye shall bind me with coercion strong Of cordage well-secured to the mast-foot, And by no struggles to be loosed of mine. But should I supplicate to be released Or give such order, then, with added cords Be it your part to bind me still the more. Thus with distinct precaution I prepared My people; rapid in her course, meantime, My gallant bark approach'd the Siren's isle, For brisk and favourable blew the wind. Then fell the wind suddenly, and serene A breathless calm ensued, while all around The billows slumber'd, lull'd by power divine. Up-sprang my people, and the folded sails Bestowing in the hold, sat to their oars, Which with their polish'd blades whiten'd the Deep. I, then, with edge of steel severing minute A waxen cake, chafed it and moulded it Between my palms; ere long the ductile mass Grew warm, obedient to that ceaseless force, And to Hyperion's all-pervading beams. With that soft liniment I fill'd the ears Of my companions, man by man, and they My feet and arms with strong coercion bound Of cordage to the mast-foot well secured. Then down they sat, and rowing, thresh'd the brine. But when with rapid course we had arrived Within such distance as a voice may reach, Not unperceived by them the gliding bark Approach'd, and thus harmonious they began. Ulysses, Chief by every tongue extoll'd, Achaia's boast, oh hither steer thy bark! Here stay thy course, and listen to our lay! These shores none passes in his sable ship Till, first, the warblings of our voice he hear, Then, happier hence and wiser he departs. All that the Greeks endured, and all the ills Inflicted by the Gods on Troy, we know, Know all that passes on the boundless earth. So they with voices sweet their music poured Melodious on my ear, winning with ease My heart's desire to listen, and by signs I bade my people, instant, set me free. But they incumbent row'd, and from their seats Eurylochus and Perimedes sprang With added cords to bind me still the more. This danger past, and when the Siren's voice, Now left remote, had lost its power to charm, Then, my companions freeing from the wax Their ears, deliver'd me from my restraint. The island, left afar, soon I discern'd Huge waves, and smoke, and horrid thunderings heard. All sat aghast; forth flew at once the oars From every hand, and with a clash the waves Smote altogether; check'd, the galley stood, By billow-sweeping oars no longer urged, And I, throughout the bark, man after man Encouraged all, addressing thus my crew. We meet not, now, my friends, our first distress. This evil is not greater than we found When the huge Cyclops in his hollow den Imprison'd us, yet even thence we 'scaped, My intrepidity and fertile thought Opening the way; and we shall recollect These dangers also, in due time, with joy. Come, then—pursue my counsel. Ye your seats Still occupying, smite the furrow'd flood With well-timed strokes, that by the will of Jove We may escape, perchance, this death, secure. To thee the pilot thus I speak, (my words Mark thou, for at thy touch the rudder moves,) This smoke, and these tumultuous waves avoid; Steer wide of both; yet with an eye intent On yonder rock, lest unaware thou hold Too near a course, and plunge us into harm. So I; with whose advice all, quick, complied. But Scylla I as yet named not, (that woe Without a cure,) lest, terrified, my crew Should all renounce their oars, and crowd below. Just then, forgetful of the strict command Of Circe not to arm, I cloath'd me all In radiant armour, grasp'd two quivering spears, And to the deck ascended at the prow, Expecting earliest notice there, what time The rock-bred Scylla should annoy my friends. But I discern'd her not, nor could, although To weariness of sight the dusky rock I vigilant explored. Thus, many a groan Heaving, we navigated sad the streight, For here stood Scylla, while Charybdis there With hoarse throat deep absorb'd the briny flood. Oft as she vomited the deluge forth, Like water cauldron'd o'er a furious fire The whirling Deep all murmur'd, and the spray On both those rocky summits fell in showers. But when she suck'd the salt wave down again, Then, all the pool appear'd wheeling about Within, the rock rebellow'd, and the sea Drawn off into that gulf disclosed to view The oozy bottom. Us pale horror seized. Thus, dreading death, with fast-set eyes we watch'd Charybdis; meantime, Scylla from the bark Caught six away, the bravest of my friends. With eyes, that moment, on my ship and crew Retorted, I beheld the legs and arms Of those whom she uplifted in the air; On me they call'd, my name, the last, last time Pronouncing then, in agony of heart. As when from some bold point among the rocks The angler, with his taper rod in hand, Casts forth his bait to snare the smaller fry, He swings away remote his guarded They passed the line through a pipe of horn, to secure it against the fishes' bite. line, Then jerks his gasping prey forth from the Deep, So Scylla them raised gasping to the rock, And at her cavern's mouth devour'd them loud- Shrieking, and stretching forth to me their arms In sign of hopeless misery. Ne'er beheld These eyes in all the seas that I have roam'd, A sight so piteous, nor in all my toils. From Scylla and Charybdis dire escaped, We reach'd the noble island of the Sun Ere long, where bright Hyperion's beauteous herds Broad-fronted grazed, and his well-batten'd flocks. I, in the bark and on the sea, the voice Of oxen bellowing in hovels heard, And of loud bleating sheep; then dropp'd the word Into my memory of the sightless Seer, Theban Tiresias, and the caution strict Of Circe, my Ææan monitress, Who with such force had caution'd me to avoid The island of the Sun, joy of mankind. Thus then to my companions, sad, I spake. Hear ye, my friends! although long time distress'd, The words prophetic of the Theban seer And of Ææan Circe, whose advice Was oft repeated to me to avoid This island of the Sun, joy of mankind. There, said the Goddess, dread your heaviest woes, Pass the isle, therefore, scudding swift away. I ceased; they me with consternation heard, And harshly thus Eurylochus replied. Ulysses, ruthless Chief! no toils impair Thy strength, of senseless iron thou art form'd, Who thy companions weary, and o'erwatch'd Forbidd'st to disembark on this fair isle, Where now, at last, we might with ease regale. Thou, rash, command'st us, leaving it afar, To roam all night the Ocean's dreary waste; But winds to ships injurious spring by night, And how shall we escape a dreadful death If, chance, a sudden gust from South arise Or stormy West, that dash in pieces oft The vessel, even in the Gods' despight? Prepare we rather now, as night enjoins, Our evening fare beside the sable bark, In which at peep of day we may again Launch forth secure into the boundless flood. He ceased, whom all applauded. Then I knew That sorrow by the will of adverse heaven Approach'd, and in wing'd accents thus replied. I suffer force, Eurylochus! and yield O'er-ruled by numbers. Come, then, swear ye all A solemn oath, that should we find an herd Or numerous flock, none here shall either sheep Or bullock slay, by appetite profane Seduced, but shall the viands eat content Which from immortal Circe we received. I spake; they readily a solemn oath Sware all, and when their oath was fully sworn, Within a creek where a fresh fountain rose They moor'd the bark, and issuing, began Brisk preparation of their evening cheer. But when nor hunger now nor thirst remain'd Unsated, recollecting, then, their friends By Scylla seized and at her cave devour'd, They mourn'd, nor ceased to mourn them, till they slept. The night's third portion come, when now the stars Had traversed the mid sky, cloud-gatherer Jove Call'd forth a vehement wind with tempest charged, Menacing earth and sea with pitchy clouds Tremendous, and the night fell dark from heaven. But when Aurora, daughter of the day, Look'd rosy forth, we haled, drawn inland more, Our bark into a grot, where nymphs were wont Graceful to tread the dance, or to repose. Convening there my friends, I thus began. My friends! food fails us not, but bread is yet And wine on board. Abstain we from the herds, Lest harm ensue; for ye behold the flocks And herds of a most potent God, the Sun! Whose eye and watchful ear none may elude. So saying, I sway'd the generous minds of all. A month complete the South wind ceaseless blew, Nor other wind blew next, save East and South, Yet they, while neither food nor rosy wine Fail'd them, the herds harm'd not, through fear to die. But, our provisions failing, they employ'd Whole days in search of food, snaring with hooks Birds, fishes, of what kind soe'er they might, By famine urged. I solitary roam'd Meantime the isle, seeking by prayer to move Some God to show us a deliverance thence. When, roving thus the isle, I had at length Left all my crew remote, laving my hands Where shelter warm I found from the rude blast, I supplicated every Power above; But they my prayers answer'd with slumbers soft Shed o'er my eyes, and with pernicious art Eurylochus, the while, my friends harangued. My friends! afflicted as ye are, yet hear A fellow-sufferer. Death, however caused, Abhorrence moves in miserable man, But death by famine is a fate of all Most to be fear'd. Come—let us hither drive And sacrifice to the Immortal Powers The best of all the oxen of the Sun, Resolving thus—that soon as we shall reach Our native Ithaca, we will erect To bright Hyperion an illustrious fane, Which with magnificent and numerous gifts We will enrich. But should he choose to sink Our vessel, for his stately beeves incensed, And should, with him, all heaven conspire our death, I rather had with open mouth, at once, Meeting the billows, perish, than by slow And pining waste, here in this desert isle. So spake Eurylochus, whom all approved. Then, driving all the fattest of the herd Few paces only, (for the sacred beeves Grazed rarely distant from the bark) they stood Compassing them around, and, grasping each Green foliage newly pluck'd from saplings tall, (For barley none in all our bark remain'd) Worshipp'd the Gods in prayer. Prayer made, they slew And flay'd them, and the thighs with double fat Investing, spread them o'er with slices crude. No wine had they with which to consecrate The blazing rites, but with libation poor Of water hallow'd the interior parts. Now, when the thighs were burnt, and each had shared His portion of the maw, and when the rest All slash'd and scored hung roasting at the fire, Sleep, in that moment, suddenly my eyes Forsaking, to the shore I bent my way. But ere the station of our bark I reach'd, The savoury steam greeted me. At the scent I wept aloud, and to the Gods exclaim'd. Oh Jupiter, and all ye Powers above! With cruel sleep and fatal ye have lull'd My cares to rest, such horrible offence Meantime my rash companions have devised. Then, flew long-stoled Lampetia to the Sun At once with tidings of his slaughter'd beeves. And he, incensed, the Immortals thus address'd. Jove, and ye everlasting Powers divine! Avenge me instant on the crew profane Of Laertiades; Ulysses' friends Have dared to slay my beeves, which I with joy Beheld, both when I climb'd the starry heavens, And when to earth I sloped my “westring wheels,” But if they yield me not amercement due And honourable for my loss, to Hell I will descend, and give the ghosts my beams. Then, thus the cloud-assembler God replied. Sun! shine thou still on the Immortal powers, And on the teeming earth, frail man's abode. My candent bolts can in a moment reach And split their flying bark in the mid-sea. These things Calypso told me, taught, herself, By herald Hermes, as she oft affirm'd. But when, descending to the shore, I reach'd At length my bark, with aspect stern and tone I reprimanded them, yet no redress Could frame, or remedy—the beeves were dead. Soon follow'd signs portentous sent from heaven. The skins all crept, and on the spits the flesh Both roast and raw bellow'd, as with the voice Of living beeves. Thus my devoted friends Driving the fattest oxen of the Sun, Feasted six days entire; but when the seventh By mandate of Saturnian Jove appeared, The storm then ceased to rage, and we, again Embarking, launch'd our galley, rear'd the mast, And gave our unfurl'd canvas to the wind. The island left afar, and other land Appearing none, but sky alone and sea, Right o'er the hollow bark Saturnian Jove Hung a cœrulean cloud, darkening the Deep. Not long my vessel ran, for blowing wild, Now came shrill Zephyrus; a stormy gust Snapp'd sheer the shrouds on both sides; backward fell The mast, and with loose tackle strew'd the hold; Striking the pilot in the stern, it crush'd His skull together; he a diver's plunge Made downward, and his noble spirit fled. Meantime, Jove thundering, hurl'd into the ship His bolts; she, smitten by the fires of Jove, Quaked all her length; with sulphur fill'd she reek'd, And o'er her sides headlong my people plunged Like sea-mews, interdicted by that stroke Of wrath divine to hope their country more. But I, the vessel still paced to and fro, Till, sever'd by the boisterous waves, her sides Forsook the keel now left to float alone. Snapp'd where it join'd the keel the mast had fallen, But fell encircled with a leathern brace, Which it retained; binding with this the mast And keel together, on them both I sat, Borne helpless onward by the dreadful gale. And now the West subsided, and the South Arose instead, with misery charged for me, That I might measure back my course again To dire Charybdis. All night long I drove, And when the sun arose, at Scylla's rock Once more, and at Charybdis' gulf arrived. It was the time when she absorb'd profound The briny flood, but by a wave upborne I seized the branches fast of the wild-fig See line 120.. To which, bat-like, I clung; yet where to fix My foot secure found not, or where to ascend, For distant lay the roots, and distant shot The largest arms erect into the air, O'ershadowing all Charybdis; therefore hard I clench'd the boughs, till she disgorged again Both keel and mast. Not undesired by me They came, though late; for at what hour the judge, After decision made of numerous strifes He had therefore held by the fig-tree from sun-rise till afternoon. Between young candidates for honour, leaves The forum for refreshment' sake at home, Then was it that the mast and keel emerged. Deliver'd to a voluntary fall, Fast by those beams I dash'd into the flood, And seated on them both, with oary palms Impell'd them; nor the Sire of Gods and men Permitted Scylla to discern me more, Else had I perish'd by her fangs at last. Nine days I floated thence, and on the tenth Dark night, the Gods convey'd me to the isle Ogygia, habitation of divine Calypso, by whose hospitable aid And assiduity, my strength revived. But wherefore this? ye have already learn'd That history, thou and thy illustrious spouse; I told it yesterday, and hate a tale Once amply told, then, needless, traced again. END OF VOL. XIII. BOOK XIII. ARGUMENT OF THE THIRTEENTH BOOK. Ulysses having finished his narrative, and received additional presents from the Phæacians, embarks: he is conveyed in his sleep to Ithaca, and in his sleep is landed on that island. The ship that carried him is in her return transformed by Neptune to a rock. Minerva meets him on the shore, enables him to recollect his country, which, till enlightened by her, he believed to be a country strange to him, and they concert together the means of destroying the suitors. The Goddess then repairs to Sparta to call thence Telemachus, and Ulysses, by her aid disguised like a beggar, proceeds toward the cottage of Eumæus. He ceased; the whole assembly silent sat, Charm'd into ecstasy with his discourse Throughout the twilight hall. Then, thus the King. Ulysses, since beneath my brazen dome Sublime thou hast arrived, like woes, I trust, Thou shalt not in thy voyage hence sustain By tempests tost, though much to woe inured. To you, who daily in my palace quaff Your princely meed of generous wine and hear The sacred bard, my pleasure thus I speak. The robes, wrought gold, and all the other gifts To this our guest, by the Phæacian Chiefs Brought hither in the sumptuous coffer lie. But come—present ye to the stranger, each, An ample tripod also, with a vase Of smaller size, for which we will be paid By public impost; for the charge of all Excessive were by one alone defray'd. So spake Alcinoüs, and his counsel pleased; Then, all retiring, sought repose at home. But when Aurora, daughter of the dawn, Look'd rosy forth, each hasted to the bark With his illustrious present, which the might Of King Alcinoüs, who himself her sides Ascended, safe beneath the seats bestowed, Lest it should harm or hinder, while he toil'd In rowing, some Phæacian of the crew. The palace of Alcinoüs seeking next, Together, they prepared a new regale. For them, in sacrifice, the ????? ????? ?????????. sacred might Of King Alcinoüs slew an ox to Jove Saturnian, cloud-girt governor of all. The thighs with fire prepared, all glad partook The noble feast; meantime, the bard divine Sang, sweet Demodocus, the people's joy. But oft Ulysses to the radiant sun Turn'd wistful eyes, anxious for his decline, Nor longer, now, patient of dull delay. As when some hungry swain whose sable beeves Have through the fallow dragg'd his ponderous plough All day, the setting sun views with delight For supper' sake, which with tired feet he seeks, So welcome to Ulysses' eyes appear'd The sun-set of that eve; directing, then, His speech to maritime Phæacia's sons, But to Alcinoüs chiefly, thus he said. Alcinoüs, o'er Phæacia's realm supreme! Libation made, dismiss ye me in peace, And farewell all! for what I wish'd, I have, Conductors hence, and honourable gifts With which heaven prosper me! and may the Gods Vouchsafe to me, at my return, to find All safe, my spotless consort and my friends! May ye, whom here I leave, gladden your wives And see your children blest, and may the Powers Immortal with all good enrich you all, And from calamity preserve the land! He ended; they unanimous, his speech Applauded loud, and bade dismiss the guest Who had so wisely spoken and so well. Then thus Alcinoüs to his herald spake. Pontonoüs! charging high the beaker, bear To every guest beneath our roof the wine, That, prayer preferr'd to the eternal Sire, We may dismiss our inmate to his home. Then bore Pontonoüs to every guest The brimming cup; they, where they sat, perform'd Libation due; but the illustrious Chief Ulysses, from his seat arising, placed A massy goblet in Areta's hand, To whom in accents wing'd, grateful, he said. Farewell, O Queen, a long farewell, till age Arrive, and death, the appointed lot of all! I go; but be this people, and the King Alcinoüs, and thy progeny, thy joy Yet many a year beneath this glorious roof! So saying, the Hero through the palace-gate Issued, whom, by Alcinoüs' command, The royal herald to his vessel led. Three maidens also of Areta's train His steps attended; one, the robe well-bleach'd And tunic bore; the corded coffer, one; And food the third, with wine of crimson hue. Arriving where the galley rode, each gave Her charge to some brave mariner on board, And all was safely stow'd. Meantime were spread Linen and arras on the deck astern, For his secure repose. And now the Chief Himself embarking, silent lay'd him down. Then every rower to his bench repair'd; They drew the loosen'd cable from its hold In the drill'd rock, and resupine, at once With lusty strokes upturn'd the flashing waves. His eye-lids soon sleep, falling as a dew, Closed fast, death's simular, in sight the same. She, as four harness'd stallions o'er the plain Shooting together at the scourge's stroke, Toss high their manes, and rapid scour along, So mounted she the waves, while dark the flood Roll'd after her of the resounding Deep. Steady she ran and safe, passing in speed The falcon, swiftest of the fowls of heaven; With such rapidity she cut the waves, An Hero bearing like the Gods above In wisdom, one familiar long with woe In fight sustain'd, and on the perilous flood, Though sleeping now serenely, and resign'd To sweet oblivion of all sorrow past. The brightest star of heaven, precursor chief Of day-spring, now arose, when at the isle (Her voyage soon perform'd) the bark arrived. There is a port sacred in Ithaca To Phorcys, hoary antient of the Deep, Form'd by converging shores, prominent both And both abrupt, which from the spacious bay Exclude all boisterous winds; within it, ships (The port once gain'd) uncabled ride secure. An olive, at the haven's head, expands Her branches wide, near to a pleasant cave Umbrageous, to the nymphs devoted named The Naiads. In that cave beakers of stone And jars are seen; bees lodge their honey there; And there, on slender spindles of the rock The nymphs of rivers weave their wondrous robes. Perennial springs water it, and it shows A twofold entrance; ingress one affords To mortal man, which Northward looks direct, But holier is the Southern far; by that No mortal enters, but the Gods alone. Familiar with that port before, they push'd The vessel in; she, rapid, plow'd the sands With half her keel, such rowers urged her on. Descending from the well-bench'd bark ashore, They lifted forth Ulysses first, with all His splendid couch complete, then lay'd him down Still wrapt in balmy slumber on the sands. His treasures next, by the Phæacian Chiefs At his departure given him as the meed Due to his wisdom, at the olive's foot They heap'd, without the road, lest while he slept Some passing traveller should rifle them. Then homeward thence they sped. Nor Ocean's God His threats forgot denounced against divine Ulysses, but with Jove thus first advised. Eternal Sire! I shall no longer share Respect and reverence among the Gods, Since now Phæacia's mortal race have ceased To honour me, though from myself derived. It was my purpose, that by many an ill Harrass'd, Ulysses should have reach'd his home, Although to intercept him, whose return Thyself had promised, ne'er was my intent. But him fast-sleeping swiftly o'er the waves They have conducted, and have set him down In Ithaca, with countless gifts enrich'd, With brass, and tissued raiment, and with gold; Much treasure! more than he had home convey'd Even had he arrived with all his share Allotted to him of the spoils of Troy. To whom the cloud-assembler God replied. What hast thou spoken, Shaker of the shores, Wide-ruling Neptune? Fear not; thee the Gods Will ne'er despise; dangerous were the deed To cast dishonour on a God by birth More ancient, and more potent far than they. But if, profanely rash, a mortal man Should dare to slight thee, to avenge the wrong Some future day is ever in thy power. Accomplish all thy pleasure, thou art free. Him answer'd then the Shaker of the shores. Jove cloud-enthroned! that pleasure I would soon Perform as thou hast said, but that I watch Thy mind continual, fearful to offend. My purpose is, now to destroy amid The dreary Deep yon fair Phæacian bark, Return'd from safe conveyance of her freight; So shall they waft such wanderers home no more, And she shall hide their city, to a rock Transform'd of mountainous o'ershadowing size. Him then Jove answer'd, gatherer of the clouds. Perform it, O my brother, and the deed Thus done, shall best be done;—What time the people Shall from the city her approach descry, Fix her to stone transform'd, but still in shape A gallant bark, near to the coast, that all May wonder, seeing her transform'd to stone Of size to hide their city from the view. These words once heard, the Shaker of the shores Instant to Scheria, maritime abode Of the Phæacians, went. Arrived, he watch'd. And now the flying bark full near approach'd, When Neptune, meeting her, with outspread palm Depress'd her at a stroke, and she became Deep-rooted stone. Then Neptune went his way. Phæacia's ship-ennobled sons meantime Conferring stood, and thus in accents wing'd, The amazed spectator to his fellow spake. Ah! who hath sudden check'd the vessel's course Homeward? This moment she was all in view. Thus they, unconscious of the cause, to whom Alcinoüs, instructing them, replied. Ye Gods! a prophecy now strikes my mind With force, my father's. He was wont to say— Neptune resents it, that we safe conduct Natives of every region to their home. He also spake, prophetic, of a day When a Phæacian gallant bark, return'd After conveyance of a stranger hence, Should perish in the dreary Deep, and changed To a huge mountain, cover all the town. So spake my father, all whose words we see This day fulfill'd. Thus, therefore, act we all Unanimous; henceforth no longer bear The stranger home, when such shall here arrive; And we will sacrifice, without delay, Twelve chosen bulls to Neptune, if, perchance, He will commiserate us, and forbear To hide our town behind a mountain's height. He spake, they, terrified, the bulls prepared. Thus all Phæacia's Senators and Chiefs His altar compassing, in prayer adored The Ocean's God. Meantime Ulysses woke, Unconscious where; stretch'd on his native soil He lay, and knew it not, long time exiled. For Pallas, progeny of Jove, a cloud Drew dense around him, that ere yet agnized By others, he might wisdom learn from her, Neither to citizens, nor yet to friends Reveal'd, nor even to his own espoused, Till, first, he should avenge complete his wrongs Domestic from those suitors proud sustain'd. All objects, therefore, in the Hero's eyes Seem'd alien, foot-paths long, commodious ports, Heaven-climbing rocks, and trees of amplest growth. Arising, fixt he stood, his native soil Contemplating, till with expanded palms Both thighs he smote, and plaintive thus began. Ah me! what mortal race inhabits here? Rude are they, contumacious and unjust, Or hospitable, and who fear the Gods? Where now shall I secrete these numerous stores? Where wander I, myself? I would that still Phæacians own'd them, and I had arrived In the dominions of some other King Magnanimous, who would have entertain'd And sent me to my native home secure! Now, neither know I where to place my wealth, Nor can I leave it here, lest it become Another's prey. Alas! Phæacia's Chiefs Not altogether wise I deem or just, Who have misplaced me in another land, Promised to bear me to the pleasant shores Of Ithaca, but have not so perform'd. Jove, guardian of the suppliant's rights, who all Transgressors marks, and punishes all wrong, Avenge me on the treacherous race!—but hold— I will revise my stores, so shall I know If they have left me here of aught despoil'd. So saying, he number'd carefully the gold, The vases, tripods bright, and tissued robes, But nothing miss'd of all. Then he bewail'd His native isle, with pensive steps and slow Pacing the border of the billowy flood, Forlorn; but while he wept, Pallas approach'd, In form a shepherd stripling, girlish fair In feature, such as are the sons of Kings; A sumptuous mantle o'er his shoulders hung Twice-folded, sandals his nice feet upbore, And a smooth javelin glitter'd in his hand. Ulysses, joyful at the sight, his steps Turn'd brisk toward her, whom he thus address'd. Sweet youth! since thee, of all mankind, I first Encounter in this land unknown, all hail! Come not with purposes of harm to me! These save, and save me also. I prefer To thee, as to some God, my prayer, and clasp Thy knees a suppliant. Say, and tell me true, What land? what people? who inhabit here? Is this some isle delightful, or a shore Of fruitful main-land sloping to the sea? Then Pallas thus, Goddess cœrulean-eyed. Stranger! thou sure art simple, or hast dwelt Far distant hence, if of this land thou ask. It is not, trust me, of so little note, But known to many, both to those who dwell Toward the sun-rise, and to others placed Behind it, distant in the dusky West. Rugged it is, not yielding level course To the swift steed, and yet no barren spot, However small, but rich in wheat and wine; Nor wants it rain or fertilizing dew, But pasture green to goats and beeves affords, Trees of all kinds, and fountains never dry. Ithaca therefore, stranger, is a name Known even at Troy, a city, by report, At no small distance from Achaia's shore. The Goddess ceased; then, toil-enduring Chief Ulysses, happy in his native land, (So taught by Pallas, progeny of Jove) In accents wing'd her answering, utter'd prompt Not truth, but figments to truth opposite, For guile in him stood never at a pause. O'er yonder flood, even in spacious Homer dates all the fictions of Ulysses from Crete, as if he meant to pass a similiar censure on the Cretans to that quoted by St. Paul—?????? ??? ???????. Crete I heard of Ithaca, where now, it seems, I have myself with these my stores arrived; Not richer stores than, flying thence, I left To my own children; for from Crete I fled For slaughter of Orsilochus the swift, Son of Idomeneus, whom none in speed Could equal throughout all that spacious isle. His purpose was to plunder me of all My Trojan spoils, which to obtain much woe I had in battle and by storms endured, For that I would not gratify his Sire, Fighting beside him in the fields of Troy, But led a different band. Him from the field Returning homeward, with my brazen spear I smote, in ambush waiting his return At the road-side, with a confederate friend. Unwonted darkness over all the heavens That night prevailed, nor any eye of man Observed us, but unseen I slew the youth. No sooner then with my sharp spear of life I had bereft him, than I sought a ship Mann'd by renown'd Phæacians, whom with gifts Part of my spoils, and by requests, I won. I bade them land me on the Pylian shore, Or in fair Elis by the Epeans ruled; But they, reluctant, were by violent winds Driven devious thence, for fraud they purposed none. Thus through constraint we here arrived by night, And with much difficulty push'd the ship Into safe harbour, nor was mention made Of food by any, though all needed food, But disembark'd in haste, on shore we lay. I, weary, slept profound, and they my goods Forth heaving from the bark, beside me placed The treasures on the sea-beach where I slept, Then reimbarking, to the populous coast Steer'd of Sidonia, and me left forlorn. He ceased; then smiled Minerva azure-eyed And stroak'd his cheek, in form a woman now, Beauteous, majestic, in all elegant arts Accomplish'd, and with accents wing'd replied. Who passes thee in artifice well-framed And in imposture various, need shall find Of all his policy, although a God. Canst thou not cease, inventive as thou art And subtle, from the wiles which thou hast loved Since thou wast infant, and from tricks of speech Delusive, even in thy native land? But come, dismiss we these ingenious shifts From our discourse, in which we both excel; For thou of all men in expedients most Abound'st and eloquence, and I, throughout All heaven have praise for wisdom and for art. And know'st thou not thine Athenæan aid, Pallas, Jove's daughter, who in all thy toils Assist thee and defend? I gave thee power To engage the hearts of all Phæacia's sons, And here arrive even now, counsels to frame Discrete with thee, and to conceal the stores Given to thee by the rich Phæacian Chiefs On my suggestion, at thy going thence. I will inform thee also what distress And hardship under thy own palace-roof Thou must endure; which since constraint enjoins, Bear patiently, and neither man apprize Nor woman that thou hast arrived forlorn And vagabond, but silent undergo What wrongs soever from the hands of men. To whom Ulysses, ever wise, replied. O Goddess! thou art able to elude, Wherever met, the keenest eye of man, For thou all shapes assumest; yet this I know Certainly, that I ever found thee kind, Long as Achaia's Heroes fought at Troy; But when (the lofty towers of Priam laid In dust,) we re-embark'd, and by the will Of heaven Achaia's fleet was scatter'd wide, Thenceforth, O daughter wise of Jove, I thee Saw not, nor thy appearance in my ship Once mark'd, to rid me of my numerous woes, But always bearing in my breast a heart With anguish riven, I roam'd, till by the Gods Relieved at length, and till with gracious words Thyself didst in Phæacia's opulent land Confirm my courage, and becamest my guide. But I adjure thee in thy father's name— O tell me truly, (for I cannot hope That I have reach'd fair Ithaca; I tread Some other soil, and thou affirm'st it mine To mock me merely, and deceive,) oh say— Am I in Ithaca? in truth, at home? Thus then Minerva the cœrulean-eyed. Such caution ever in thy breast prevails Distrustful; but I know thee eloquent, With wisdom and with ready thought endued, And cannot leave thee therefore thus distress'd. For what man, save Ulysses, new-return'd After long wanderings, would not pant to see At once his home, his children, and his wife? But thou preferr'st neither to know nor ask Concerning them, till some experience first Thou make of her whose wasted youth is spent In barren solitude, and who in tears Ceaseless her nights and woeful days consumes. I ne'er was ignorant, but well foreknew That not till after loss of all thy friends Thou should'st return; but loth I was to oppose Neptune, my father's brother, sore incensed For his son's sake deprived of sight by thee. But, I will give thee proof—come now—survey These marks of Ithaca, and be convinced. This is the port of Phorcys, sea-born sage; That, the huge olive at the haven's head; Fast by it, thou behold'st the pleasant cove Umbrageous, to the nymphs devoted named The Naiads; this the broad-arch'd cavern is Where thou wast wont to offer to the nymphs Many a whole hecatomb; and yonder stands The mountain Neritus with forests cloathed. So saying, the Goddess scatter'd from before His eyes all darkness, and he knew the land. Then felt Ulysses, Hero toil-inured, Transport unutterable, seeing plain Once more his native isle. He kiss'd the glebe, And with uplifted hands the nymphs adored. Nymphs, Naiads, Jove's own daughters! I despair'd To see you more, whom yet with happy vows I now can hail again. Gifts, as of old, We will hereafter at your shrines present, If Jove-born Pallas, huntress of the spoils, Grant life to me, and manhood to my son. Then Pallas, blue-eyed progeny of Jove. Take courage; trouble not thy mind with thoughts Now needless. Haste—delay not—far within This hallow'd cave's recess place we at once Thy precious stores, that they may thine remain, Then muse together on thy wisest course. So saying, the Goddess enter'd deep the cave Caliginous, and its secret nooks explored From side to side; meantime Ulysses brought All his stores into it, the gold, the brass, And robes magnificent, his gifts received From the Phæacians; safe he lodged them all, And Pallas, daughter of Jove ægis-arm'd, Closed fast, herself, the cavern with a stone. Then, on the consecrated olive's root Both seated, they in consultation plann'd The deaths of those injurious suitors proud, And Pallas, blue-eyed Goddess, thus began. Laertes' noble son, Ulysses! think By what means likeliest thou shalt assail Those shameless suitors, who have now controul'd Three years thy family, thy matchless wife With language amorous and with spousal gifts Urging importunate; but she, with tears Watching thy wish'd return, hope gives to all By messages of promise sent to each, Framing far other purposes the while. Then answer thus Ulysses wise return'd. Ah, Agamemnon's miserable fate Had surely met me in my own abode, But for thy gracious warning, power divine! Come then—Devise the means; teach me, thyself, The way to vengeance, and my soul inspire With daring fortitude, as when we loosed Her radiant frontlet from the brows of Troy. Would'st thou with equal zeal, O Pallas! aid Thy servant here, I would encounter thrice An hundred enemies, let me but perceive Thy dread divinity my prompt ally. Him answer'd then Pallas cœrulean-eyed. And such I will be; not unmark'd by me, (Let once our time of enterprize arrive) Shalt thou assail them. Many, as I judge, Of those proud suitors who devour thy wealth Shall leave their brains then on thy palace-floor. But come. Behold! I will disguise thee so That none shall know thee; I will parch the skin On thy fair body; I will cause thee shed Thy wavy locks; I will enfold thee round In such a kirtle as the eyes of all Shall loath to look on; and I will deform With blurring rheums thy eyes, so vivid erst; So shall the suitors deem thee, and thy wife, And thy own son whom thou didst leave at home, Some sordid wretch obscure. But seek thou first Thy swine-herd's mansion; he, alike, intends Thy good, and loves affectionate thy son And thy Penelope; thou shalt find the swain Tending his herd; they feed beneath the rock Corax, at side of Arethusa's fount, On acorns dieted, nutritious food To them, and drinking of the limpid stream. There waiting, question him of thy concerns, While I from Sparta praised for women fair Call home thy son Telemachus, a guest With Menelaus now, whom to consult In spacious Lacedæmon he is gone, Anxious to learn if yet his father lives. To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied. And why, alas! all-knowing as thou art, Him left'st thou ignorant? was it that he, He also, wand'ring wide the barren Deep, Might suffer woe, while these devour his wealth? Him answer'd then Pallas cœrulean-eyed. Grieve thou not much for him. I sent him forth Myself, that there arrived, he might acquire Honour and fame. No sufferings finds he there, But in Atrides' palace safe resides, Enjoying all abundance. Him, in truth, The suitors watch close ambush'd on the Deep, Intent to slay him ere he reach his home, But shall not as I judge, till of themselves The earth hide some who make thee, now, a prey. So saying, the Goddess touch'd him with a wand. At once o'er all his agile limbs she parch'd The polish'd skin; she wither'd to the root His wavy locks, and cloathed him with the hide Deform'd of wrinkled age; she charged with rheums His eyes before so vivid, and a cloak And kirtle gave him, tatter'd both, and foul, And smutch'd with smoke; then casting over all An huge old deer-skin bald, with a long staff She furnish'd him, and with a wallet patch'd On all sides, dangling by a twisted thong. Thus all their plan adjusted, different ways They took, and she, seeking Ulysses' son, To Lacedæmon's spacious realm repair'd. BOOK XIV. ARGUMENT OF THE FOURTEENTH BOOK. Ulysses arriving at the house of Eumæus, is hospitably entertained, and spends the night there. Leaving the haven-side, he turn'd his steps Into a rugged path, which over hills Mantled with trees led him to the abode By Pallas mention'd of his noble ???? ???????.—The swine-herd's was therefore in those days, and in that country, an occupation honourable as well as useful. Barnes deems the epithet ???? significant of his noble birth. Vide Clarke in loco. friend The swine-herd, who of all Ulysses' train Watch'd with most diligence his rural stores. Him sitting in the vestibule he found Of his own airy lodge commodious, built Amidst a level lawn. That structure neat Eumæus, in the absence of his Lord, Had raised, himself, with stones from quarries hewn, Unaided by Laertes or the Queen. With tangled thorns he fenced it safe around, And with contiguous stakes riven from the trunks Of solid oak black-grain'd hemm'd it without. Twelve penns he made within, all side by side, Lairs for his swine, and fast-immured in each Lay fifty pregnant females on the floor. The males all slept without, less numerous far, Thinn'd by the princely wooers at their feasts Continual, for to them he ever sent The fattest of his saginated charge. Three hundred, still, and sixty brawns remained. Four mastiffs in adjoining kennels lay, Resembling wild-beasts, nourish'd at the board Of the illustrious steward of the styes. Himself sat fitting sandals to his feet, Carved from a stain'd ox-hide. Four hinds he kept, Now busied here and there; three in the penns Were occupied; meantime, the fourth had sought The city, whither, for the suitors use, With no good will, but by constraint, he drove A boar, that sacrificing to the Gods, The imperious guests might on his flesh regale. Soon as those clamorous watch-dogs the approach Saw of Ulysses, baying loud, they ran Toward him; he, as ever, well-advised, Squatted, and let his staff fall from his hand. Yet foul indignity he had endured Even there, at his own farm, but that the swain, Following his dogs in haste, sprang through the porch To his assistance, letting fall the hide. With chiding voice and vollied stones he soon Drove them apart, and thus his Lord bespake. Old man! one moment more, and these my dogs Had, past doubt, worried thee, who should'st have proved, So slain, a source of obloquy to me. But other pangs the Gods, and other woes To me have given, who here lamenting sit My godlike master, and his fatted swine Nourish for others' use, while he, perchance, A wanderer in some foreign city seeks Fit sustenance, and none obtains, if still Indeed he live, and view the light of day. But, old friend! follow me into the house, That thou, at least, with plenteous food refresh'd, And cheer'd with wine sufficient, may'st disclose Both who thou art, and all that thou hast borne. So saying, the generous swine-herd introduced Ulysses, and thick bundles spread of twigs Beneath him, cover'd with the shaggy skin Of a wild goat, of which he made his couch Easy and large; the Hero, so received, Rejoiced, and thus his gratitude express'd. Jove grant thee and the Gods above, my host, For such beneficence thy chief desire! To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply. My guest! I should offend, treating with scorn The stranger, though a poorer should arrive Than even thyself; for all the poor that are, And all the strangers are the care of Jove. Little, and with good will, is all that lies Within my scope; no man can much expect From servants living in continual fear Under young masters; for the Gods, no doubt, Have intercepted my own Lord's return, From whom great kindness I had, else, received, With such a recompense as servants gain From generous masters, house and competence, And lovely wife from many a wooer won, Whose industry should have requited well His goodness, with such blessing from the Gods As now attends me in my present charge. Much had I, therefore, prosper'd, had my Lord Grown old at home; but he hath died.—I would That the whole house of Helen, one and all, Might perish too, for she hath many slain Who, like my master, went glory to win For Agamemnon in the fields of Troy. So saying, he girdled, quick, his tunic close, And issuing, sought the styes; thence bringing two Of the imprison'd herd, he slaughter'd both, Singed them, and slash'd and spitted them, and placed The whole well-roasted banquet, spits and all, Reeking before Ulysses; last with flour He sprinkled them, and filling with rich wine His ivy-goblet, to his master sat Opposite, whom inviting thus he said. Now, eat, my guest! such as a servant may I set before thee, neither large of growth Nor fat; the fatted—those the suitors eat, Fearless of heaven, and pitiless of man. Yet deeds unjust as theirs the blessed Gods Love not; they honour equity and right. Even an hostile band when they invade A foreign shore, which by consent of Jove They plunder, and with laden ships depart, Even they with terrors quake of wrath divine. But these are wiser; these must sure have learn'd From some true oracle my master's death, Who neither deign with decency to woo, Nor yet to seek their homes, but boldly waste His substance, shameless now, and sparing nought. Jove ne'er hath given us yet the night or day When with a single victim, or with two They would content them, and his empty jars Witness how fast the squanderers use his wine. Time was when he was rich indeed; such wealth No Hero own'd on yonder continent, Nor yet in Ithaca; no twenty Chiefs Could match with all their treasures his alone; I tell thee their amount. Twelve herds of his The mainland It may be proper to suggest that Ulysses was lord of part of the continent opposite to Ithaca—viz.—of the peninsula Nericus or Leuca, which afterward became an island, and is now called Santa Maura. F. graze; as many flocks of sheep; As many droves of swine; and hirelings there And servants of his own feed for his use, As many numerous flocks of goats; his goats, (Not fewer than eleven numerous flocks) Here also graze the margin of his fields Under the eye of servants well-approved, And every servant, every day, brings home The goat, of all his flock largest and best. But as for me, I have these swine in charge, Of which, selected with exactest care From all the herd, I send the prime to them. He ceased; meantime Ulysses ate and drank Voracious, meditating, mute, the death Of those proud suitors. His repast, at length, Concluded, and his appetite sufficed, Eumæus gave him, charged with wine, the cup From which he drank himself; he, glad, received The boon, and in wing'd accents thus began. My friend, and who was he, wealthy and brave As thou describest the Chief, who purchased thee? Thou say'st he perish'd for the glory-sake Of Agamemnon. Name him; I, perchance, May have beheld the Hero. None can say But Jove and the inhabitants of heaven That I ne'er saw him, and may not impart News of him; I have roam'd through many a clime. To whom the noble swineherd thus replied. Alas, old man! no traveller's tale of him Will gain his consort's credence, or his son's; For wanderers, wanting entertainment, forge Falsehoods for bread, and wilfully deceive. No wanderer lands in Ithaca, but he seeks With feign'd intelligence my mistress' ear; She welcomes all, and while she questions each Minutely, from her lids lets fall the tear Affectionate, as well beseems a wife Whose mate hath perish'd in a distant land. Thou could'st thyself, no doubt, my hoary friend! (Would any furnish thee with decent vest And mantle) fabricate a tale with ease; Yet sure it is that dogs and fowls, long since, His skin have stript, or fishes of the Deep Have eaten him, and on some distant shore Whelm'd in deep sands his mouldering bones are laid. So hath he perish'd; whence, to all his friends, But chiefly to myself, sorrow of heart; For such another Lord, gentle as he, Wherever sought, I have no hope to find, Though I should wander even to the house Of my own father. Neither yearns my heart So feelingly (though that desiring too) To see once more my parents and my home, As to behold Ulysses yet again. Ah stranger! absent as he is, his name Fills me with reverence, for he loved me much, Cared for me much, and though we meet no more, Holds still an elder brother's part in me. Him answer'd then, the Hero toil-inured. My friend! since his return, in thy account, Is an event impossible, and thy mind Always incredulous that hope rejects, I shall not slightly speak, but with an oath.— Ulysses comes again; and I demand No more, than that the boon such news deserves, Be given me soon as he shall reach his home. Then give me vest and mantle fit for wear, Which, ere that hour, much as I need them both, I neither ask, nor will accept from thee. For him whom poverty can force aside From truth—I hate him as the gates of hell. Be Jove, of all in heaven, my witness first, Then, this thy hospitable board, and last, The household Gods of the illustrious Chief Himself, Ulysses, to whose gates I go, That all my words shall surely be fulfill'd. In this same year Ulysses shall arrive, Ere, this month closed, another month succeed, He shall return, and punish all who dare Insult his consort and his noble son. To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply. Old friend! that boon thou ne'er wilt earn from me: Ulysses comes no more. But thou thy wine Drink quietly, and let us find, at length, Some other theme; recall not this again To my remembrance, for my soul is grieved Oft as reminded of my honour'd Lord. Let the oath rest, and let Ulysses come Even as myself, and as Penelope, And as his ancient father, and his son Godlike Telemachus, all wish he may. Ay—there I feel again—nor cease to mourn His son Telemachus; who, when the Gods Had given him growth like a young plant, and I Well hoped that nought inferior he should prove In person or in mind to his own sire, Hath lost, through influence human or divine, I know not how, his sober intellect, And after tidings of his sire is gone To far-famed Pylus; his return, meantime, In ambush hidden the proud suitors wait, That the whole house may perish of renown'd Arcesias, named in Ithaca no more. But whether he have fallen or 'scaped, let him Rest also, whom Saturnian Jove protect! But come, my ancient guest! now let me learn Thy own afflictions; answer me in truth. Who, and whence art thou? in what city born? Where dwell thy parents? in what kind of ship Camest thou? the mariners, why brought they thee To Ithaca? and of what land are they? For that on foot thou found'st us not, is sure. Him answer'd then Ulysses ever-wise. I will with truth resolve thee; and if here Within thy cottage sitting, we had wine And food for many a day, and business none But to regale at ease while others toil'd, I could exhaust the year complete, my woes Rehearsing, nor at last, rehearse entire My sorrows by the will of heaven sustain'd. I boast me sprung from ancestry renown'd In spacious Crete; son of a wealthy sire, Who other sons train'd numerous in his house, Born of his wedded wife: but he begat Me on his purchased concubine, whom yet Dear as his other sons in wedlock born Castor Hylacides esteem'd and loved, For him I boast my father. Him in Crete, While yet he lived, all reverenced as a God, So rich, so prosperous, and so blest was he With sons of highest praise. But death, the doom Of all, him bore to Pluto's drear abode, And his illustrious sons among themselves Portion'd his goods by lot; to me, indeed, They gave a dwelling, and but little more; Yet, for my virtuous qualities, I won A wealthy bride, for I was neither vain Nor base, forlorn as thou perceivest me now. But thou canst guess, I judge, viewing the straw What once was in the ear. Ah! I have borne Much tribulation; heap'd and heavy woes. Courage and phalanx-breaking might had I From Mars and Pallas; at what time I drew, (Planning some dread exploit) an ambush forth Of our most valiant Chiefs, no boding fears Of death seized me, but foremost far of all I sprang to fight, and pierced the flying foe. Such was I once in arms. But household toils Sustain'd for children' sake, and carking cares To enrich a family, were not for me. My pleasures were the gallant bark, the din Of battle, the smooth spear and glittering shaft, Objects of dread to others, but which me The Gods disposed to love and to enjoy. Thus different minds are differently amused; For ere Achaia's fleet had sail'd to Troy, Nine times was I commander of an host Embark'd against a foreign foe, and found In all those enterprizes great success. From the whole booty, first, what pleased me most Choosing, and sharing also much by lot I rapidly grew rich, and had thenceforth Among the Cretans reverence and respect. But when loud-thundering Jove that voyage dire Ordain'd, which loosed the knees of many a Greek, Then to Idomeneus and me they gave The charge of all their fleet, which how to avoid We found not, so importunate the cry Of the whole host impell'd us to the task. There fought we nine long years, and in the tenth (Priam's proud city pillaged) steer'd again Our galleys homeward, which the Gods dispersed. Then was it that deep-planning Jove devised For me much evil. One short month, no more, I gave to joys domestic, in my wife Happy, and in my babes, and in my wealth, When the desire seized me with several ships Well-rigg'd, and furnish'd all with gallant crews, To sail for Ægypt; nine I fitted forth, To which stout mariners assembled fast. Six days the chosen partners of my voyage Feasted, to whom I numerous victims gave For sacrifice, and for their own regale. Embarking on the seventh from spacious Crete, Before a clear breeze prosperous from the North We glided easily along, as down A river's stream; nor one of all my ships Damage incurr'd, but healthy and at ease We sat, while gales well-managed urged us on. The fifth day thence, smooth-flowing Nile we reach'd, And safe I moor'd in the Ægyptian stream. Then, charging all my mariners to keep Strict watch for preservation of the ships, I order'd spies into the hill-tops; but they Under the impulse of a spirit rash And hot for quarrel, the well-cultured fields Pillaged of the Ægyptians, captive led Their wives and little ones, and slew the men. Soon was the city alarm'd, and at the cry Down came the citizens, by dawn of day, With horse and foot and with the gleam of arms Filling the plain. Then Jove with panic dread Struck all my people; none found courage more To stand, for mischief swarm'd on every side. There, numerous by the glittering spear we fell Slaughter'd, while others they conducted thence Alive to servitude. But Jove himself My bosom with this thought inspired, (I would That, dying, I had first fulfill'd my fate In Ægypt, for new woes were yet to come!) Loosing my brazen casque, and slipping off My buckler, there I left them on the field, Then cast my spear away, and seeking, next, The chariot of the sovereign, clasp'd his knees, And kiss'd them. He, by my submission moved, Deliver'd me, and to his chariot-seat Raising, convey'd me weeping to his home. With many an ashen spear his warriors sought To slay me, (for they now grew fiery-wroth) But he through fear of hospitable Jove, Chief punisher of wrong, saved me alive. Seven years I there abode, and much amass'd Among the Ægyptians, gifted by them all; But, in the eighth revolving year, arrived A shrew'd Phœnician, in all fraud adept, Hungry, and who had numerous harm'd before, By whom I also was cajoled, and lured To attend him to Phœnicia, where his house And his possessions lay; there I abode A year complete his inmate; but (the days And months accomplish'd of the rolling year, And the new seasons entering on their course,) To Libya then, on board his bark, by wiles He won me with him, partner of the freight Profess'd, but destined secretly to sale, That he might profit largely by my price. Not unsuspicious, yet constrain'd to go, With this man I embark'd. A cloudless gale Propitious blowing from the North, our ship Ran right before it through the middle sea, In the offing over Crete; but adverse Jove Destruction plann'd for them and death the while. For, Crete now left afar, and other land Appearing none, but sky alone and sea, Right o'er the hollow bark Saturnian Jove A cloud cœrulean hung, darkening the Deep. Then, thundering oft, he hurl'd into the bark His bolts; she smitten by the fires of Jove, Quaked all her length; with sulphur fill'd she reek'd, And o'er her sides precipitated, plunged Like gulls the crew, forbidden by that stroke Of wrath divine to hope their country more. But Jove himself, when I had cast away All hope of life, conducted to my arms The strong tall mast, that I might yet escape. Around that beam I clung, driving before The stormy blast. Nine days complete I drove, And on the tenth dark night, the rolling flood Immense convey'd me to Thesprotia's shore. There me the Hero Phidon, generous King Of the Thesprotians, freely entertain'd; For his own son discovering me with toil Exhausted and with cold, raised me, and thence Led me humanely to his father's house, Who cherish'd me, and gave me fresh attire. There heard I of Ulysses, whom himself Had entertain'd, he said, on his return To his own land; he shew'd me also gold, Brass, and bright steel elaborate, whatsoe'er Ulysses had amass'd, a store to feed A less illustrious family than his To the tenth generation, so immense His treasures in the royal palace lay. Himself, he said, was to Dodona gone, There, from the towering oaks of Jove to ask Counsel divine, if openly to land (After long absence) in his opulent realm Of Ithaca, be best, or in disguise. To me the monarch swore, in his own hall Pouring libation, that the ship was launch'd, And the crew ready for his conduct home. But me he first dismiss'd, for, as it chanced, A ship lay there of the Thesprotians, bound To green Dulichium's isle. He bade the crew Bear me to King Acastus with all speed; But them far other thoughts pleased more, and thoughts Of harm to me, that I might yet be plunged In deeper gulfs of woe than I had known. For when the billow-cleaving bark had left The land remote framing combined a plot Against my liberty, they stripp'd my vest And mantle, and this tatter'd raiment foul Gave me instead, which thy own eyes behold. At even-tide reaching the cultured coast Of Ithaca, they left me bound on board With tackle of the bark, and quitting ship Themselves, made hasty supper on the shore. But me, meantime, the Gods easily loosed By their own power, when with this wrapper vile Around my brows, sliding into the sea At the ship's stern, I lay'd me on the flood. With both hands oaring thence my course, I swam Till past all ken of theirs; then landing where Thick covert of luxuriant trees I mark'd, Close couchant down I lay; they muttering loud, Paced to and fro, but deeming farther search Unprofitable, soon embark'd again. Thus baffling all their search with ease, the Gods Conceal'd and led me thence to the abode Of a wise man, dooming me still to live. To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply. Alas! my most compassionable guest! Thou hast much moved me by this tale minute Of thy sad wanderings and thy numerous woes. But speaking of Ulysses, thou hast pass'd All credence; I at least can give thee none. Why, noble as thou art, should'st thou invent Palpable falsehoods? as for the return Of my regretted Lord, myself I know That had he not been hated by the Gods Unanimous, he had in battle died At Troy, or (that long doubtful war, at last, Concluded,) in his people's arms at home. Then universal Greece had raised his tomb, And he had even for his son atchieved Immortal glory; but alas! by beaks Of harpies torn, unseemly sight, he lies. Here is my home the while; I never seek The city, unless summon'd by discrete Penelope to listen to the news Brought by some stranger, whencesoe'er arrived. Then, all, alike inquisitive, attend, Both who regret the absence of our King, And who rejoice gratuitous to gorge His property; but as for me, no joy Find I in listening after such reports, Since an Ætolian cozen'd me, who found (After long wandering over various lands A fugitive for blood,) my lone retreat. Him warm I welcom'd, and with open arms Received, who bold affirm'd that he had seen My master with Idomeneus in Crete His ships refitting shatter'd by a storm, And that in summer with his godlike band He would return, bringing great riches home, Or else in autumn. And thou ancient guest Forlorn! since thee the Gods have hither led, Seek not to gratify me with untruths And to deceive me, since for no such cause I shall respect or love thee, but alone By pity influenced, and the fear of Jove. To whom Ulysses, ever wise, replied. Thou hast, in truth, a most incredulous mind, Whom even with an oath I have not moved, Or aught persuaded. Come then—let us make In terms express a covenant, and the Gods Who hold Olympus, witness to us both! If thy own Lord at this thy house arrive, Thou shalt dismiss me decently attired In vest and mantle, that I may repair Hence to Dulichium, whither I would go. But if thy Lord come not, then, gathering all Thy servants, headlong hurl me from a rock, That other mendicants may fear to lie. To whom the generous swine-herd in return. Yes, stranger! doubtless I should high renown Obtain for virtue among men, both now And in all future times, if, having first Invited thee, and at my board regaled, I next should slay thee; then my prayers would mount, Past question, swiftly to Saturnian Jove. But the hour calls to supper, and ere long, The partners of my toils will come prepared To spread the board with no unsavoury cheer. Thus they conferr'd. And now the swains arrived, Driving their charge, which fast they soon enclosed Within their customary penns, and loud The hubbub was of swine prison'd within. Then call'd the master to his rustic train. Bring ye the best, that we may set him forth Before my friend from foreign climes arrived, With whom ourselves will also feast, who find The bright-tusk'd multitude a painful charge, While others, at no cost of theirs, consume Day after day, the profit of our toils. So saying, his wood for fuel he prepared, And, dragging thither a well fatted brawn Of the fifth year, his servants held him fast At the hearth-side. Nor fail'd the master swain To adore the Gods, (for wise and good was he,) But consecration of the victim, first, Himself performing, cast into the fire The forehead bristles of the tusky boar, Then pray'd to all above, that safe at length, Ulysses might regain his native home. Then lifting an huge shive that lay beside The fire, he smote the boar, and dead he fell. Next, piercing him, and scorching close his hair, They carved him quickly, and Eumæus spread Thin slices crude taken from every limb O'er all his fat, then other slices cast, Sprinkling them first with meal, into the fire. The rest they slash'd and scored, and roasted well, And placed it, heap'd together, on the board. Then rose the good Eumæus to his task Of distribution, for he understood The hospitable entertainer's part. Seven-fold partition of the banquet made, He gave, with previous prayer, to Maia's Mercury. son And to the nymphs one portion of the whole, Then served his present guests, honouring first Ulysses with the boar's perpetual chine; By that distinction just his master's heart He gratified, and thus the Hero spake. Eumæus! be thou as beloved of Jove As thou art dear to me, whom, though attired So coarsely, thou hast served with such respect! To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply. Eat noble stranger! and refreshment take Such as thou may'st; God ????—without a relative, and consequently signifying God in the abstract, is not unfrequently found in Homer, though fearing to give offence to serious minds unacquainted with the original, I have not always given it that force in the translation. But here the sentiment is such as fixes the sense intended by the author with a precision that leaves me no option. It is observable too, that—??????? ??? ??????—is an inscription of power such as the poet never makes to his Jupiter. gives, and God denies At his own will, for He is Lord of all. He said, and to the everlasting Gods The firstlings sacrificed of all, then made Libation, and the cup placed in the hands Of city-spoiler Laertiades Sitting beside his own allotted share. Meantime, Mesaulius bread dispensed to all, Whom in the absence of his Lord, himself Eumæus had from Taphian traders bought With his own proper goods, at no expence Either to old Laertes or the Queen. And now, all stretch'd their hands toward the feast Reeking before them, and when hunger none Felt more or thirst, Mesaulius clear'd the board. Then, fed to full satiety, in haste Each sought his couch. Black came a moonless night, And Jove all night descended fast in showers, With howlings of the ever watery West. Ulysses, at that sound, for trial's sake Of his good host, if putting off his cloak He would accommodate him, or require That service for him at some other hand, Addressing thus the family, began. Hear now, Eumæus, and ye other swains His fellow-labourers! I shall somewhat boast, By wine befool'd, which forces even the wise To carol loud, to titter and to dance, And words to utter, oft, better suppress'd. But since I have begun, I shall proceed, Prating my fill. Ah might those days return With all the youth and strength that I enjoy'd, When in close ambush, once, at Troy we lay! Ulysses, Menelaus, and myself Their chosen coadjutor, led the band. Approaching to the city's lofty wall Through the thick bushes and the reeds that gird The bulwarks, down we lay flat in the marsh, Under our arms. Then, Boreas blowing loud, A rueful night came on, frosty and charged With snow that blanched us thick as morning rime, And every shield with ice was chrystall'd o'er. The rest with cloaks and vests well cover'd, slept Beneath their bucklers; I alone my cloak, Improvident, had left behind, no thought Conceiving of a season so severe; Shield and belt, therefore, and nought else had I. The night, at length, nigh spent, and all the stars Declining in their course, with elbow thrust Against Ulysses' side I roused the Chief, And thus address'd him ever prompt to hear. Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd! I freeze to death. Help me, or I am lost. No cloak have I; some evil dæmon, sure, Beguiled me of all prudence, that I came Thus sparely clad; I shall, I must expire. So I; he, ready as he was in arms And counsel both, the remedy at once Devised, and thus, low-whispering, answer'd me. Hush! lest perchance some other hear—He said, And leaning on his elbow, spake aloud. My friends! all hear—a monitory dream Hath reach'd me, for we lie far from the ships. Haste, therefore, one of you, with my request To Agamemnon, Atreus son, our Chief, That he would reinforce us from the camp. He spake, and at the word, Andræmon's son Thoas arose, who, casting off his cloak, Ran thence toward the ships, and folded warm Within it, there lay I till dawn appear'd. Oh for the vigour of such youth again! Then, some good peasant here, either for love Or for respect, would cloak a man like me, Whom, now, thus sordid in attire ye scorn. To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply. My ancient guest! I cannot but approve Thy narrative, nor hast thou utter'd aught Unseemly, or that needs excuse. No want Of raiment, therefore, or of aught beside Needful to solace penury like thine, Shall harm thee here; yet, at the peep of dawn Gird thy own tatters to thy loins again; For we have no great store of cloaks to boast, Or change of vests, but, singly, one for each. But when Ulysses' son shall once arrive, He will himself with vest and mantle both Cloath thee, and send thee whither most thou would'st. So saying, he rose, and nearer made his couch To the hearth-side, spreading it thick with skins Of sheep and goats; then lay the Hero down, O'er whom a shaggy mantle large he threw, Which oft-times served him with a change, when rough The winter's blast and terrible arose. So was Ulysses bedded, and the youths Slept all beside him; but the master-swain Chose not his place of rest so far remote From his rude charge, but to the outer court With his nocturnal furniture, repair'd, Gladdening Ulysses' heart that one so true In his own absence kept his rural stores. Athwart his sturdy shoulders first he slung His faulchion keen, then wrapp'd him in a cloak Thick woven, winter proof; he lifted, next, The skin of a well-thriven goat, in bulk Surpassing others, and his javelin took Sharp-pointed, with which dogs he drove and men. Thus arm'd, he sought his wonted couch beneath A hollow rock where the herd slept, secure From the sharp current of the Northern blast. BOOK XV. ARGUMENT OF THE FIFTEENTH BOOK. Telemachus, admonished by Minerva, takes leave of Menelaus, but ere he sails, is accosted by Theoclymenus, a prophet of Argos, whom at his earnest request he takes on board. In the meantime Eumæus relates to Ulysses the means by which he came to Ithaca. Telemachus arriving there, gives orders for the return of his bark to the city, and repairs himself to Eumæus. Meantime to Lacedæmon's spacious vale Minerva went, that she might summon thence Ulysses' glorious son to his own home. Arrived, she found Telemachus reposed And Nestor's son beneath the vestibule Of Menelaus, mighty Chief; she saw Pisistratus in bands of gentle sleep Fast-bound, but not Telemachus; his mind No rest enjoy'd, by filial cares disturb'd Amid the silent night, when drawing near To his couch side, the Goddess thus began. Thou canst no longer prudently remain A wanderer here, Telemachus! thy home Abandon'd, and those haughty suitors left Within thy walls; fear lest, partition made Of thy possessions, they devour the whole, And in the end thy voyage bootless prove. Delay not; from brave Menelaus ask Dismission hence, that thou may'st find at home Thy spotless mother, whom her brethren urge And her own father even now to wed Eurymachus, in gifts and in amount Of proffer'd dower superior to them all. Some treasure, else, shall haply from thy house Be taken, such as thou wilt grudge to spare. For well thou know'st how woman is disposed; Her whole anxiety is to encrease His substance whom she weds; no care hath she Of her first children, or remembers more The buried husband of her virgin choice. Returning, then, to her of all thy train Whom thou shalt most approve, the charge commit Of thy concerns domestic, till the Gods Themselves shall guide thee to a noble wife. Hear also this, and mark it. In the frith Samos the rude, and Ithaca between, The chief of all her suitors thy return In vigilant ambush wait, with strong desire To slay thee, ere thou reach thy native shore, But shall not, as I judge, till the earth hide Many a lewd reveller at thy expence. Yet steer thy galley from those isles afar, And voyage make by night; some guardian God Shall save thee, and shall send thee prosperous gales. Then, soon as thou attain'st the nearest shore Of Ithaca, dispatching to the town Thy bark with all thy people, seek at once The swine-herd; for Eumæus is thy friend. There sleep, and send him forth into the town With tidings to Penelope, that safe Thou art restored from Pylus home again. She said, and sought the Olympian heights sublime. Then, with his heel shaking him, he awoke The son of Nestor, whom he thus address'd. Rise, Nestor's son, Pisistratus! lead forth The steeds, and yoke them. We must now depart. To whom the son of Nestor thus replied. Telemachus! what haste soe'er we feel, We can by no means prudently attempt To drive by night, and soon it will be dawn. Stay, therefore, till the Hero, Atreus' son, Spear-practised Menelaus shall his gifts Place in the chariot, and with kind farewell Dismiss thee; for the guest in memory holds Through life, the host who treats him as a friend. Scarce had he spoken, when the golden dawn Appearing, Menelaus, from the side Of beauteous Helen risen, their bed approach'd, Whose coming when Telemachus perceived, Cloathing himself hastily in his vest Magnificent, and o'er his shoulders broad Casting his graceful mantle, at the door He met the Hero, whom he thus address'd. Atrides Menelaus, Chief renown'd! Dismiss me hence to Ithaca again, My native isle, for I desire to go. Him answer'd Menelaus famed in arms. Telemachus! I will not long delay Thy wish'd return. I disapprove alike The host whose assiduity extreme Distresses, and whose negligence offends; The middle course is best; alike we err, Him thrusting forth whose wish is to remain, And hindering the impatient to depart. This only is true kindness—To regale The present guest, and speed him when he would. Yet stay, till thou shalt see my splendid gifts Placed in thy chariot, and till I command My women from our present stores to spread The table with a plentiful repast. For both the honour of the guest demands, And his convenience also, that he eat Sufficient, entering on a length of road. But if through Hellas thou wilt take thy way And traverse Argos, I will then myself Attend thee; thou shalt journey with my steeds Beneath thy yoke, and I will be thy guide To many a city, whence we shall not go Ungratified, but shall in each receive Some gift at least, tripod, or charger bright, Or golden chalice, or a pair of mules. To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied. Atrides Menelaus, Chief renown'd! I would at once depart, (for guardian none Of my possessions have I left behind,) Lest, while I seek my father, I be lost Myself, or lose what I should grudge to spare. Which when the valiant Menelaus heard, He bade his spouse and maidens spread the board At once with remnants of the last regale. Then Eteoneus came, Boetheus' son Newly arisen, for nigh at hand he dwelt, Whom Menelaus bade kindle the fire By which to dress their food, and he obey'd. He, next, himself his fragrant chamber sought, Not sole, but by his spouse and by his son Attended, Megapenthes. There arrived Where all his treasures lay, Atrides, first, Took forth, himself, a goblet, then consign'd To his son's hand an argent beaker bright. Meantime, beside her coffers Helen stood Where lay her variegated robes, fair works Of her own hand. Producing one, in size And in magnificence the chief, a star For splendour, and the lowest placed of all, Loveliest of her sex, she bore it thence. Then, all proceeding through the house, they sought Telemachus again, whom reaching, thus The Hero of the golden locks began. May Jove the Thunderer, dread Juno's mate, Grant thee Telemachus! such voyage home As thy own heart desires! accept from all My stores selected as the richest far And noblest gift for finish'd beauty—This. I give thee wrought elaborate a cup, Itself all silver, bound with lip of gold. It is the work of Vulcan, which to me The Hero Phædimus imparted, King Of the Sidonians, when on my return, Beneath his roof I lodged. I make it thine. So saying, the Hero, Atreus' son, the cup Placed in his hands, and Megapenthes set Before him, next, the argent beaker bright; But lovely Helen drawing nigh, the robe Presented to him, whom she thus address'd. I also give thee, oh my son, a gift, Which seeing, thou shalt think on her whose hands Wrought it; a present on thy nuptial day For thy fair spouse; meantime, repose it safe In thy own mother's keeping. Now, farewell! Prosperous and happy be thy voyage home! She ceased, and gave it to him, who the gift Accepted glad, and in the chariot-chest Pisistratus the Hero all disposed, Admiring them the while. They, following, next, The Hero Menelaus to his hall Each on his couch or on his throne reposed. A maiden, then, with golden ewer charged And silver bowl, pour'd water on their hands, And spread the polish'd table, which with food Various, selected from her present stores, The mistress of the household charge supplied. Boetheus' son stood carver, and to each His portion gave, while Megapenthes, son Of glorious Menelaus, served the cup. Then, all with outstretch'd hands the feast assail'd, And when nor hunger more nor thirst of wine They felt, Telemachus and Nestor's son Yoked the swift steeds, and, taking each his seat In the resplendent chariot, drove at once Right through the sounding portico abroad. But Menelaus, Hero amber-hair'd, A golden cup bearing with richest wine Replete in his right hand, follow'd them forth, That not without libation first perform'd They might depart; he stood before the steeds, And drinking first, thus, courteous, them bespake. Health to you both, young friends! and from my lips Like greeting bear to Nestor, royal Chief, For he was ever as a father kind To me, while the Achaians warr'd at Troy. To whom Telemachus discrete replied. And doubtless, so we will; at our return We will report to him, illustrious Prince! Thy every word. And oh, I would to heaven That reaching Ithaca, I might at home Ulysses hail as sure, as I shall hence Depart, with all benevolence by thee Treated, and rich in many a noble gift. While thus he spake, on his right hand appear'd An eagle; in his talons pounced he bore A white-plumed goose domestic, newly taken From the house court. Ran females all and males Clamorous after him; but he the steeds Approaching on the right, sprang into air. That sight rejoicing and with hearts revived They view'd, and thus Pisistratus his speech Amid them all to Menelaus turn'd. Now, Menelaus, think, illustrious Chief! If us, this omen, or thyself regard. While warlike Menelaus musing stood What answer fit to frame, Helen meantime, His spouse long-stoled preventing him, began. Hear me; for I will answer as the Gods Teach me, and as I think shall come to pass. As he, descending from his place of birth The mountains, caught our pamper'd goose away, So shall Ulysses, after many woes And wanderings to his home restored, avenge His wrongs, or even now is at his home For all those suitors sowing seeds of woe. To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied. Oh grant it Jove, Juno's high-thundering mate! So will I, there arrived, with vow and prayer Thee worship, as thou wert thyself divine. He said, and lash'd the coursers; fiery they And fleet, sprang through the city to the plain. All day the yoke on either side they shook, Journeying swift; and now the setting sun To gloomy evening had resign'd the roads, When they to Pheræ came, and in the house Of good Diocles slept, their liberal host, Whose sire Orsilochus from Alpheus sprang. But when Aurora, daughter of the Dawn, Look'd rosy from the East, yoking their steeds, They in the sumptuous chariot sat again. Forth through the vestibule they drove, and through The sounding portico, when Nestor's son Plied brisk the scourge, and willing flew the steeds. Thus whirl'd along, soon they approach'd the gates Of Pylus, when Telemachus, his speech Turning to his companion, thus began. How, son of Nestor! shall I win from thee Not promise only but performance kind Of my request? we are not bound alone To friendship by the friendship of our sires, But by equality of years, and this Our journey shall unite us still the more. Bear me not, I entreat thee, noble friend! Beyond the ship, but drop me at her side, Lest ancient Nestor, though against my will, Detain me in his palace through desire To feast me, for I dread the least delay. He spake; then mused Pisistratus how best He might effect the wishes of his friend, And thus at length resolved; turning his steeds With sudden deviation to the shore He sought the bark, and placing in the stern Both gold and raiment, the illustrious gifts Of Menelaus, thus, in accents wing'd With ardour, urged Telemachus away. Dispatch, embark, summon thy crew on board, Ere my arrival notice give of thine To the old King; for vehement I know His temper, neither will he let thee hence, But, hasting hither, will himself enforce Thy longer stay, that thou may'st not depart Ungifted; nought will fire his anger more. So saying, he to the Pylian city urged His steeds bright-maned, and at the palace-gate Arrived of Nestor speedily; meantime Telemachus exhorted thus his crew. My gallant friends! set all your tackle, climb The sable bark, for I would now return. He spake; they heard him gladly, and at once All fill'd the benches. While his voyage he Thus expedited, and beside the stern To Pallas sacrifice perform'd and pray'd, A stranger, born remote, who had escaped From Argos' fugitive for blood, a seer, And of Melampus' progeny approach'd. Melampus, in old time, in Pylus dwelt, Mother of flocks, alike for wealth renown'd And the magnificence of his abode. He, flying from the far-famed Pylian King, The mighty Neleus, migrated at length Into another land, whose wealth, the while, Neleus by force possess'd a year complete. Meantime, Melampus in the house endured Iphyclus the son of Phylacus had seized and detained cattle belonging to Neleus; Neleus ordered his nephew Melampus to recover them, and as security for his obedience seized on a considerable part of his possessions. Melampus attempted the service, failed, and was cast into prison; but at length escaping, accomplish'd his errand, vanquish'd Neleus in battle, and carried off his daughter Pero, whom Neleus had promised to the brother of Melampus, but had afterward refused her.Of Phylacus imprisonment and woe, And burn'd with wrath for Neleus' daughter sake By fell Erynnis kindled in his heart. But 'scaping death, he drove the lowing beeves From Phylace to Pylus, well avenged His numerous injuries at Neleus' hands Sustain'd, and gave into his brother's arms King Neleus' daughter fair, the promised bride. To Argos steed-renown'd he journey'd next, There destined to inhabit and to rule Multitudes of Achaians. In that land He married, built a palace, and became Father of two brave sons, Antiphates And Mantius; to Antiphates was born The brave Oïcleus; from Oïcleus sprang Amphiaraus, demagogue renown'd, Whom with all tenderness, and as a friend Alike the Thunderer and Apollo prized; Yet reach'd he not the bounds of hoary age, But by his mercenary His wife Eryphyle, bribed by Polynices, persuaded him, though aware that death awaited him at that city, to go to Thebes, where he fell accordingly. consort's arts Persuaded, met his destiny at Thebes. He 'gat Alcmæon and Amphilochus. Mantius was also father of two sons, Clytus and Polyphides. Clytus pass'd From earth to heaven, and dwells among the Gods, Stolen by Aurora for his beauty's sake. But (brave Amphiaraüs once deceased) Phœbus exalted Polyphides far Above all others in the prophet's part. He, anger'd by his father, roam'd away To Hyperesia, where he dwelt renown'd Throughout all lands, the oracle of all. His son, named Theoclymenus, was he Who now approach'd; he found Telemachus Libation offering in his bark, and prayer, And in wing'd accents ardent him address'd. Ah, friend! since sacrificing in this place I find thee, by these sacred rites and those Whom thou ador'st, and by thy own dear life, And by the lives of these thy mariners I beg true answer; hide not what I ask. Who art thou? whence? where born? and sprung from whom? To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied. I will inform thee, stranger! and will solve Thy questions with much truth. I am by birth Ithacan, and Ulysses was my sire. But he hath perish'd by a woeful death, And I, believing it, with these have plow'd The Ocean hither, interested to learn A father's fate long absent from his home. Then answer'd godlike Theoclymenus. I also am a wanderer, having slain A man of my own tribe; brethren and friends Numerous had he in Argos steed-renown'd, And powerful are the Achaians dwelling there. From them, through terrour of impending death, I fly, a banish'd man henceforth for ever. Ah, save a suppliant fugitive! lest death O'ertake me, for I doubt not their pursuit. Whom thus Telemachus answer'd discrete. I shall not, be assured, since thou desirest To join me, chace thee from my bark away. Follow me, therefore, and with us partake, In Ithaca, what best the land affords. So saying, he at the stranger's hand received His spear, which on the deck he lay'd, then climb'd Himself the bark, and seated in the stern, At his own side placed Theoclymenus. They cast the hawsers loose; then with loud voice Telemachus exhorted all to hand The tackle, whom his sailors prompt obey'd. The tall mast heaving, in its socket deep They lodged it, and its cordage braced secure, Then, straining at the halyards, hoised the sail. Fair wind, and blowing fresh through æther pure Minerva sent them, that the bark might run Her nimblest course through all the briny way. Now sank the sun, and dusky evening dimm'd The waves, when, driven by propitious Jove, His bark stood right for Pheræ; thence she stretch'd To sacred Elis, where the Epeans rule, And through the sharp Echinades he next Steer'd her, uncertain whether fate ordain'd His life or death, surprizal or escape. Meantime Ulysses and the swineherd ate Their cottage-mess, and the assistant swains Theirs also; and when hunger now and thirst Had ceased in all, Ulysses thus began, Proving the swineherd, whether friendly still, And anxious for his good, he would entreat His stay, or thence hasten him to the town. Eumæus, and all ye his servants, hear! It is my purpose, lest I wear thee out, Thee and thy friends, to seek at early dawn The city, there to beg:—but give me first Needful instructions, and a trusty guide Who may conduct me thither; there my task Must be to roam the streets; some hand humane Perchance shall give me a small pittance there, A little bread, and a few drops to drink. Ulysses' palace I shall also seek, And to discrete Penelope report My tidings; neither shall I fail to mix With those imperious suitors, who, themselves Full-fed, may spare perhaps some boon to me. Me shall they find, in whatsoe'er they wish Their ready servitor, for (understand And mark me well,) the herald of the skies, Hermes, from whom all actions of mankind Their grace receive and polish, is my friend; So that in menial offices I fear No rival, whether I be call'd to heap The hearth with fuel, or dry wood to cleave, To roast, to carve, or to distribute wine, As oft the poor are wont who serve the great. To whom, Eumæus! at those words displeased, Thou didst reply. Gods! how could such a thought Possess thee, stranger? surely thy resolve Is altogether fixt to perish there, If thou indeed hast purposed with that throng To mix, whose riot and outrageous acts Of violence echo through the vault of heaven. None, such as thou, serve them; their servitors Are youths well-cloak'd, well-vested; sleek their heads, And smug their countenances; such alone Are their attendants, and the polish'd boards Groan overcharged with bread, with flesh, with wine. Rest here content; for neither me nor these Thou weariest aught, and when Ulysses' son Shall come, he will with vest and mantle fair Cloath thee, and send thee whither most thou would'st To whom, Ulysses, Hero toil-inured. I wish thee, O Eumæus! dear to Jove As thou art dear to me, for this reprieve Vouchsafed me kind, from wandering and from woe! No worse condition is of mortal man Than his who wanders; for the poor man, driven By woe and by misfortune homeless forth, A thousand miseries, day by day, endures. Since thou detain'st me then, and bidd'st me wait His coming, tell me if the father still Of famed Ulysses live, whom, going hence, He left so nearly on the verge of life? And lives his mother? or have both deceased Already, and descended to the shades? To whom the master swineherd thus replied. I will inform thee, and with strictest truth, Of all that thou hast ask'd. Laertes lives, But supplication offering to the Gods Ceaseless, to free him from a weary life, So deeply his long-absent son he mourns, And the dear consort of his early youth, Whose death is his chief sorrow, and hath brought Old age on him, or ere its date arrived. She died of sorrow for her glorious son, And died deplorably She is said to have hanged herself.; may never friend Of mine, or benefactor die as she! While yet she lived, dejected as she was, I found it yet some solace to converse With her, who rear'd me in my childish days, Together with her lovely youngest-born The Princess Ctimena; for side by side We grew, and I, scarce honour'd less than she. But soon as our delightful prime we both Attain'd, to Samos her they sent, a bride, And were requited with rich dower; but me Clothed handsomely with tunic and with vest, And with fair sandals furnish'd, to the field She order'd forth, yet loved me still the more. I miss her kindness now; but gracious heaven Prospers the work on which I here attend; Hence have I food, and hence I drink, and hence Refresh sometimes a worthy guest like thee. But kindness none experience I, or can, From fair Penelope (my mistress now) In word or action, so is the house cursed With that lewd throng. Glad would the servants be Might they approach their mistress, and receive Advice from her; glad too to eat and drink, And somewhat bear each to his rural home, For perquisites are every servant's joy. Then answer thus, Ulysses wise return'd. Alas! good swain, Eumæus, how remote From friends and country wast thou forced to roam Even in thy infancy! But tell me true. The city where thy parents dwelt, did foes Pillage it? or did else some hostile band Surprising thee alone, on herd or flock Attendant, bear thee with them o'er the Deep, And sell thee at this Hero's house, who pay'd Doubtless for thee no sordid price or small? To whom the master swineherd in reply. Stranger! since thou art curious to be told My story, silent listen, and thy wine At leisure quaff. The nights are longest now, And such as time for sleep afford, and time For pleasant conference; neither were it good That thou should'st to thy couch before thy hour, Since even sleep is hurtful, in excess. Whoever here is weary, and desires Early repose, let him depart to rest, And at the peep of day, when he hath fed Sufficiently, drive forth my master's herd; But we with wine and a well-furnish'd board Supplied, will solace mutually derive From recollection of our sufferings past; For who hath much endured, and wander'd far, Finds the recital even of sorrow sweet. Now hear thy question satisfied; attend! There is an island (thou hast heard, perchance, Of such an isle,) named Syria Not improbably the isthmus of Syracuse, an island, perhaps, or peninsula at that period, or at least imagined to be such by Homer. The birth of Diana gave fame to Ortygia. F.; it is placed Above Ortygia, and a dial ??? ?????? ??????.—The Translator has rendered the passage according to that interpretation of it to which several of the best expositors incline. Nothing can be so absurd as to suppose, that Homer, so correct in his geography, could mean to place a Mediterranean island under the Tropic. owns True to the tropic changes of the year. No great extent she boasts, yet is she rich In cattle and in flocks, in wheat and wine. No famine knows that people, or disease Noisome of all that elsewhere seize the race Of miserable man; but when old age Steals on the the citizens, Apollo, arm'd With silver bow and bright Diana come, Whose gentle shafts dismiss them soon to rest. Two cities share between them all the isle, And both were subject to my father's sway Ctesius Ormenides, a godlike Chief. It chanced that from Phœnicia, famed for skill In arts marine, a vessel thither came By sharpers mann'd, and laden deep with toys. Now, in my father's family abode A fair Phœnician, tall, full-sized, and skill'd In works of elegance, whom they beguiled. While she wash'd linen on the beach, beside The ship, a certain mariner of those Seduced her; for all women, even the wise And sober, feeble prove by love assail'd. Who was she, he enquired, and whence? nor she Scrupled to tell at once her father's home. I am of Sidon A principal city of Phœnicia., famous for her works In brass and steel; daughter of Arybas, Who rolls in affluence; Taphian pirates thence Stole me returning from the field, from whom This Chief procured me at no little cost. Then answer thus her paramour return'd. Wilt thou not hence to Sidon in our ship, That thou may'st once more visit the abode Of thy own wealthy parents, and themselves? For still they live, and still are wealthy deem'd. To whom the woman. Even that might be, Would ye, ye seamen, by a solemn oath Assure me of a safe conveyance home. Then sware the mariners as she required, And, when their oath was ended, thus again The woman of Phœnicia them bespake. Now, silence! no man henceforth, of you all Accost me, though he meet me on the road, Or at yon fountain; lest some tattler run With tidings home to my old master's ear, Who, with suspicion touch'd, may me confine In cruel bonds, and death contrive for you. But be ye close; purchase your stores in haste; And when your vessel shall be freighted full, Quick send me notice; for I mean to bring What gold soever opportune I find, And will my passage cheerfully defray With still another moveable. I nurse The good man's son, an urchin shrewd, of age To scamper at my side; him will I bring, Whom at some foreign market ye shall prove Saleable at what price soe'er ye will. So saying, she to my father's house return'd. They, there abiding the whole year, their ship With purchased goods freighted of every kind, And when her lading now complete, she lay For sea prepared, their messenger arrived To summon down the woman to the shore. A mariner of theirs, subtle and shrewd, Then, entering at my father's gate, produced A splendid collar, gold with amber strung. My mother (then at home) with all her maids Handling and gazing on it with delight, Proposed to purchase it, and he the nod Significant, gave unobserved, the while, To the Phœnician woman, and return'd. She, thus inform'd, leading me by the hand Went forth, and finding in the vestibule The cups and tables which my father's guests Had used, (but they were to the forum gone For converse with their friends assembled there,) Convey'd three cups into her bosom-folds, And bore them off, whom I a thoughtless child Accompanied, at the decline of day, When dusky evening had embrown'd the shore. We, stepping nimbly on, soon reach'd the port Renown'd, where that Phœnician vessel lay. They shipp'd us both, and all embarking cleaved Their liquid road by favourable gales, Jove's gift, impell'd. Six days we day and night Continual sail'd, but when Saturnian Jove Now bade the seventh bright morn illume the skies, Then shaft-arm'd Dian struck the woman dead. At once she pitch'd headlong into the bilge Like a sea-coot, whence heaving her again, The seamen gave her to be fishes' food, And I survived to mourn her. But the winds And rolling billows them bore to the coast Of Ithaca, where with his proper goods Laertes bought me. By such means it chanced That ere I saw the isle in which I dwell. To whom Ulysses, glorious Chief replied. Eumæus! thou hast moved me much, thy woes Enumerating thus at large. But Jove Hath neighbour'd all thy evil with this good, That after numerous sorrows thou hast reach'd The house of a kind master, at whose hands Thy sustenance is sure, and here thou lead'st A tranquil life; but I have late arrived, City after city of the world explored. Thus mutual they conferr'd, nor leisure found Save for short sleep, by morning soon surprised. Meantime the comrades of Telemachus Approaching land, cast loose the sail, and lower'd Alert the mast, then oar'd the vessel in. The anchors heaved The anchors were lodged on the shore, not plunged as ours. aground, and hawsers tied Secure, themselves, forth-issuing on the shore, Breakfast prepared, and charged their cups with wine. When neither hunger now, nor thirst remained Unsatisfied, Telemachus began. Push ye the sable bark without delay Home to the city. I will to the field Among my shepherds, and, (my rural works Survey'd,) at eve will to the town return. To morrow will I set before you wine And plenteous viands, wages of your toil. To whom the godlike Theoclymenus. Whither must I, my son? who, of the Chiefs Of rugged Ithaca, shall harbour me? Shall I to thine and to thy mother's house? Then thus Telemachus, discrete, replied. I would invite thee to proceed at once To our abode, since nought should fail thee there Of kind reception, but it were a course Now not adviseable; for I must myself, Be absent, neither would my mother's eyes Behold thee, so unfrequent she appears Before the suitors, shunning whom, she sits Weaving continual at the palace-top. But I will name to thee another Chief Whom thou may'st seek, Eurymachus, the son Renown'd of prudent Polybus, whom all The people here reverence as a God. Far noblest of them all is he, and seeks More ardent than his rivals far, to wed My mother, and to fill my father's throne. But, He who dwells above, Jove only knows If some disastrous day be not ordain'd For them, or ere those nuptials shall arrive. While thus he spake, at his right hand appear'd, Messenger of Apollo, on full wing, A falcon; in his pounces clench'd he bore A dove, which rending, down he pour'd her plumes Between the galley and Telemachus. Then calling him apart, the prophet lock'd His hand in his, and thus explain'd the sign. Not undirected by the Gods his flight On our right hand, Telemachus! this hawk Hath wing'd propitious; soon as I perceived I knew him ominous.—In all the isle No family of a more royal note Than yours is found, and yours shall still prevail. Whom thus Telemachus answer'd discrete. Grant heaven, my guest! that this good word of thine Fail not, and soon thou shalt such bounty share And friendship at my hands, that at first sight, Whoe'er shall meet thee shall pronounce thee blest. Then, to Piræus thus, his friend approved. Piræus, son of Clytius! (for of all My followers to the shore of Pylus, none More prompt than thou hath my desires perform'd,) Now also to thy own abode conduct This stranger, whom with hospitable care Cherish and honour till myself arrive. To whom Piræus answer'd, spear-renown'd. Telemachus! however long thy stay, Punctual I will attend him, and no want Of hospitality shall he find with me. So saying, he climb'd the ship, then bade the crew Embarking also, cast the hawsers loose, And each obedient to his bench repaired. Meantime Telemachus his sandals bound, And lifted from the deck his glittering spear. Then as Telemachus had bidden them, Son of divine Ulysses, casting loose The hawsers, forth they push'd into the Deep And sought the city; while with nimble pace Proceeding thence, Telemachus attain'd The cottage soon where good Eumæus slept, The swine-herd, faithful to his numerous charge. BOOK XVI. ARGUMENT OF THE SIXTEENTH BOOK. Telemachus dispatches Eumæus to the city to inform Penelope of his safe return from Pylus; during his absence, Ulysses makes himself known to his son. The suitors, having watched for Telemachus in vain, arrive again at Ithaca. It was the hour of dawn, when in the cot Kindling fresh fire, Ulysses and his friend Noble Eumæus dress'd their morning fare, And sent the herdsmen with the swine abroad. Seeing Telemachus, the watchful dogs Bark'd not, but fawn'd around him. At that sight, And at the sound of feet which now approach'd, Ulysses in wing'd accents thus remark'd. Eumæus! certain, either friend of thine Is nigh at hand, or one whom well thou know'st; Thy dogs bark not, but fawn on his approach Obsequious, and the sound of feet I hear. Scarce had he ceased, when his own son himself Stood in the vestibule. Upsprang at once Eumæus wonder-struck, and from his hand Let fall the cups with which he was employ'd Mingling rich wine; to his young Lord he ran, His forehead kiss'd, kiss'd his bright-beaming eyes And both his hands, weeping profuse the while. As when a father holds in his embrace Arrived from foreign lands in the tenth year His darling son, the offspring of his age, His only one, for whom he long hath mourn'd, So kiss'd the noble peasant o'er and o'er Godlike Telemachus, as from death escaped, And in wing'd accents plaintive thus began. Light of my eyes, thou comest; it is thyself, Sweetest Telemachus! I had no hope To see thee more, once told that o'er the Deep Thou hadst departed for the Pylian coast. Enter, my precious son; that I may sooth My soul with sight of thee from far arrived, For seldom thou thy feeders and thy farm Visitest, in the city custom'd much To make abode, that thou may'st witness there The manners of those hungry suitors proud. To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied. It will be so. There is great need, my friend! But here, for thy sake, have I now arrived, That I may look on thee, and from thy lips Learn if my mother still reside at home, Or have become spouse of some other Chief, Leaving untenanted Ulysses' bed To be by noisome spiders webb'd around. To whom the master-swineherd in return. Not so, she, patient still as ever, dwells Beneath thy roof, but all her cheerless days Despairing wastes, and all her nights in tears. So saying, Eumæus at his hand received His brazen lance, and o'er the step of stone Enter'd Telemachus, to whom his sire Relinquish'd, soon as he appear'd, his seat, But him Telemachus forbidding, said— Guest, keep thy seat; our cottage will afford Some other, which Eumæus will provide. He ceased, and he, returning at the word, Reposed again; then good Eumæus spread Green twigs beneath, which, cover'd with a fleece, Supplied Ulysses' offspring with a seat. He next disposed his dishes on the board With relics charged of yesterday; with bread, Alert, he heap'd the baskets; with rich wine His ivy-cup replenish'd; and a seat Took opposite to his illustrious Lord Ulysses. They toward the plenteous feast Stretch'd forth their hands, (and hunger now and thirst Both satisfied,) Telemachus, his speech Addressing to their generous host, began. Whence is this guest, my father? How convey'd Came he to Ithaca? What country boast The mariners with whom he here arrived? For that on foot he found us not, is sure. To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply. I will with truth answer thee, O my son! He boasts him sprung from ancestry renown'd In spacious Crete, and hath the cities seen Of various lands, by fate ordain'd to roam. Even now, from a Thesprotian ship escaped, He reach'd my cottage—but he is thy own; I yield him to thee; treat him as thou wilt; He is thy suppliant, and depends on thee. Then thus, Telemachus, discrete, replied. Thy words, Eumæus, pain my very soul. For what security can I afford To any in my house? myself am young, Nor yet of strength sufficient to repel An offer'd insult; and my mother's mind In doubtful balance hangs, if still with me An inmate, she shall manage my concerns, Attentive only to her absent Lord And her own good report, or shall espouse The noblest of her wooers, and the best Entitled by the splendour of his gifts. But I will give him, since I find him lodged A guest beneath thy roof, tunic and cloak, Sword double-edged, and sandals to his feet, With convoy to the country of his choice. Still, if it please thee, keep him here thy guest, And I will send him raiment, with supplies Of all sorts, lest he burthen thee and thine. But where the suitors come, there shall not he With my consent, nor stand exposed to pride And petulance like theirs, lest by some sneer They wound him, and through him, wound also me: For little is it that the boldest can Against so many; numbers will prevail. Him answer'd then Ulysses toil-inured. Oh amiable and good! since even I Am free to answer thee, I will avow My heart within me torn by what I hear Of those injurious suitors, who the house Infest of one noble as thou appear'st. But say—submittest thou to their controul Willingly, or because the people, sway'd By some response oracular, incline Against thee? Thou hast brothers, it may chance, Slow to assist thee,—for a brother's aid Is of importance in whatever cause. For oh that I had youth as I have will, Or that renown'd Ulysses were my sire, Or that myself might wander home again, Whereof hope yet remains! then might I lose My head, that moment, by an alien's hand, If I would fail, entering Ulysses' gate, To be the bane and mischief of them all. But if alone to multitudes opposed I should perchance be foiled, nobler it were With my own people, under my own roof To perish, than to witness evermore Their unexampled deeds, guests shoved aside, Maidens dragg'd forcibly from room to room, Casks emptied of their rich contents, and them Indulging gluttonous appetite day by day Enormous, without measure, without end. To whom, Telemachus, discrete, replied. Stranger! thy questions shall from me receive True answer. Enmity or hatred none Subsists the people and myself between, Nor have I brothers to accuse, whose aid Is of importance in whatever cause, For Jove hath from of old with single heirs Our house supplied; Arcesias none begat Except Laertes, and Laertes none Except Ulysses, and Ulysses me Left here his only one, and unenjoy'd. Thence comes it that our palace swarms with foes; For all the rulers of the neighbour-isles, Samos, Dulichium, and the forest-crown'd Zacynthus, others also rulers here In craggy Ithaca, my mother seek In marriage, and my household stores consume. But neither she those nuptial rites abhorr'd Refuses absolute, nor yet consents To end them; they my patrimony waste Meantime, and will destroy me also soon, As I expect, but heaven disposes all. Eumæus! haste, my father! bear with speed News to Penelope that I am safe, And have arrived from Pylus; I will wait Till thou return; and well beware that none Hear thee beside, for I have many foes. To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply. It is enough. I understand. Thou speak'st To one intelligent. But say beside, Shall I not also, as I go, inform Distress'd Laertes? who while yet he mourn'd Ulysses only, could o'ersee the works, And dieted among his menials oft As hunger prompted him; but now, they say, Since thy departure to the Pylian shore, He neither eats as he was wont, nor drinks, Nor oversees his hinds, but sighing sits And weeping, wasted even to the bone. Him then Telemachus answer'd discrete. Hard though it be, yet to his tears and sighs Him leave we now. We cannot what we would. For were the ordering of all events Referr'd to our own choice, our first desire Should be to see my father's glad return. But once thy tidings told, wander not thou In quest of Him, but hither speed again. Rather request my mother that she send Her household's governess without delay Privately to him; she shall best inform The ancient King that I have safe arrived. He said, and urged him forth, who binding on His sandals, to the city bent his way. Nor went Eumæus from his home unmark'd By Pallas, who in semblance of a fair Damsel, accomplish'd in domestic arts, Approaching to the cottage' entrance, stood Opposite, by Ulysses plain discern'd, But to his son invisible; for the Gods Appear not manifest alike to all. The mastiffs saw her also, and with tone Querulous hid themselves, yet bark'd they not. She beckon'd him abroad. Ulysses saw The sign, and issuing through the outer court, Approach'd her, whom the Goddess thus bespake. Laertes' progeny, for wiles renown'd! Disclose thyself to thy own son, that death Concerting and destruction to your foes, Ye may the royal city seek, nor long Shall ye my presence there desire in vain, For I am ardent to begin the fight. Minerva spake, and with her rod of gold Touch'd him; his mantle, first, and vest she made Pure as new-blanch'd; dilating, next, his form, She gave dimensions ampler to his limbs; Swarthy again his manly hue became, Round his full face, and black his bushy chin. The change perform'd, Minerva disappear'd, And the illustrious Hero turn'd again Into the cottage; wonder at that sight Seized on Telemachus; askance he look'd, Awe-struck, not unsuspicious of a God, And in wing'd accents eager thus began. Thou art no longer, whom I lately saw, Nor are thy cloaths, nor is thy port the same. Thou art a God, I know, and dwell'st in heaven. Oh, smile on us, that we may yield thee rites Acceptable, and present thee golden gifts Elaborate; ah spare us, Power divine! To whom Ulysses, Hero toil-inured. I am no God. Why deem'st thou me divine? I am thy father, for whose sake thou lead'st A life of woe, by violence oppress'd. So saying, he kiss'd his son, while from his cheeks Tears trickled, tears till then, perforce restrain'd. Telemachus, (for he believed him not His father yet,) thus wondering spake again. My father, saidst thou? no. Thou art not He, But some Divinity beguiles my soul With mockeries, to afflict me still the more; For never mortal man could so have wrought By his own power; some interposing God Alone could render thee both young and old, For old thou wast of late, and foully clad, But wear'st the semblance now of those in heaven! To whom Ulysses, ever wise, replied. Telemachus! it is not well, my son! That thou should'st greet thy father with a face Of wild astonishment, and stand aghast. Ulysses, save myself, none comes, be sure. Such as thou seest, after ten thousand woes Which I have borne, I visit once again My native country in the twentieth year. This wonder Athenæan Pallas wrought, She cloathed me even in what form she would, For so she can. Now poor I seem and old, Now young again, and clad in fresh attire. The Gods who dwell in yonder heaven, with ease Dignify or debase a mortal man. So saying, he sat. Then threw Telemachus His arms around his father's neck, and wept. Desire intense of lamentation seized On both; soft murmurs uttering, each indulged His grief, more frequent wailing than the bird, (Eagle, or hook-nail'd vulture) from whose nest Some swain hath stolen her yet unfeather'd young. So from their eyelids they big drops distill'd Of tenderest grief, nor had the setting sun Cessation of their weeping seen, had not Telemachus his father thus address'd. What ship convey'd thee to thy native shore, My father! and what country boast the crew? For that on foot thou not arrivedst, is sure. Then thus divine Ulysses toil-inured. My son! I will explicit all relate. Conducted by Phæacia's maritime sons I came, a race accustomed to convey Strangers who visit them across the Deep. Me o'er the billows in a rapid bark Borne sleeping, on the shores of Ithaca They lay'd; rich gifts they gave me also, brass, Gold in full bags, and beautiful attire, Which, warn'd from heaven, I have in caves conceal'd. By Pallas prompted, hither I repair'd That we might plan the slaughter of our foes, Whose numbers tell me now, that I may know How powerful, certainly, and who they are, And consultation with my dauntless heart May hold, if we be able to contend Ourselves with all, or must have aid beside. Then answer thus his son, discrete, return'd. My father! thy renown hath ever rung In thy son's ears, and by report thy force In arms, and wisdom I have oft been told. But terribly thou speak'st; amazement-fixt I hear; can two a multitude oppose, And valiant warriors all? For neither ten Are they, nor twenty, but more numerous far. Learn now their numbers. Fifty youths and two Came from Dulichium; they are chosen men, And six attendants follow in their train; From Samos twenty youths and four arrive, Zacynthus also of Achaia's sons Sends twenty more, and our own island adds, Herself, her twelve chief rulers; Medon, too, Is there the herald, and the bard divine, With other two, intendants of the board. Should we within the palace, we alone, Assail them all, I fear lest thy revenge Unpleasant to thyself and deadly prove, Frustrating thy return. But recollect— Think, if thou canst, on whose confederate arm Strenuous on our behalf we may rely. To him replied his patient father bold. I will inform thee. Mark. Weigh well my words. Will Pallas and the everlasting Sire Alone suffice? or need we other aids? Then answer thus Telemachus return'd. Good friends indeed are they whom thou hast named, Though throned above the clouds; for their controul Is universal both in earth and heaven. To whom Ulysses, toil-worn Chief renown'd. Not long will they from battle stand aloof, When once within my palace, in the strength Of Mars, to sharp decision we shall urge The suitors. But thyself at early dawn Our mansion seek, that thou may'st mingle there With that imperious throng; me in due time Eumæus to the city shall conduct, In form a miserable beggar old. But should they with dishonourable scorn Insult me, thou unmoved my wrongs endure, And should they even drag me by the feet Abroad, or smite me with the spear, thy wrath Refraining, gently counsel them to cease From such extravagance; but well I know That cease they will not, for their hour is come. And mark me well; treasure what now I say Deep in thy soul. When Pallas shall, herself, Suggest the measure, then shaking my brows, I will admonish thee; thou at the sign, Remove what arms soever in the hall Remain, and in the upper palace safe Dispose them; should the suitors, missing them, Perchance interrogate thee, then reply Gently—I have removed them from the smoke; For they appear no more the arms which erst Ulysses, going hence to Ilium, left, But smirch'd and sullied by the breath of fire. This weightier reason (thou shalt also say,) Jove taught me; lest, intoxicate with wine, Ye should assault each other in your brawls, Shaming both feast and courtship; for the view Itself of arms incites to their abuse. Yet leave two faulchions for ourselves alone, Two spears, two bucklers, which with sudden force, Impetuous we will seize, and Jove all-wise Their valour shall, and Pallas, steal away. This word store also in remembrance deep— If mine in truth thou art, and of my blood, Then, of Ulysses to his home return'd Let none hear news from thee, no, not my sire Laertes, nor Eumæus, nor of all The menials any, or even Penelope, That thou and I, alone, may search the drift Of our domestic women, and may prove Our serving-men, who honours and reveres And who contemns us both, but chiefly thee So gracious, and so worthy to be loved. Him then thus answer'd his illustrious son. Trust me, my father! thou shalt soon be taught That I am not of drowsy mind obtuse. But this I think not likely to avail Or thee or me; ponder it yet again; For tedious were the task, farm after farm To visit of those servants, proving each, And the proud suitors merciless devour Meantime thy substance, nor abstain from aught. Learn, if thou wilt, (and I that course myself Advise) who slights thee of the female train, And who is guiltless; but I would not try From house to house the men, far better proved Hereafter, if in truth by signs from heaven Inform'd, thou hast been taught the will of Jove. Thus they conferr'd. The gallant bark, meantime, Reach'd Ithaca, which from the Pylian shore Had brought Telemachus with all his band. Within the many-fathom'd port arrived His lusty followers haled her far aground, Then carried thence their arms, but to the house Of Clytius the illustrious gifts convey'd. Next to the royal mansion they dispatch'd An herald, charged with tidings to the Queen, That her Telemachus had reach'd the cot Of good Eumæus, and the bark had sent Home to the city; lest the matchless dame Should still deplore the absence of her son. They then, the herald and the swine-herd, each Bearing like message to his mistress, met, And at the palace of the godlike Chief Arriving, compass'd by the female throng Inquisitive, the herald thus began. Thy son, O Queen! is safe; even now return'd. Then, drawing nigh to her, Eumæus told His message also from her son received, And, his commission punctually discharged, Leaving the palace, sought his home again. Grief seized and anguish, at those tidings, all The suitors; issuing forth, on the outside Of the high wall they sat, before the gate, When Polybus' son, Eurymachus, began. My friends! his arduous task, this voyage, deem'd By us impossible, in our despight Telemachus hath atchieved. Haste! launch we forth A sable bark, our best, which let us man With mariners expert, who, rowing forth Swiftly, shall summon our companions home. Scarce had he said, when turning where he sat, Amphinomus beheld a bark arrived Just then in port; he saw them furling sail, And seated with their oars in hand; he laugh'd Through pleasure at that sight, and thus he spake. Our message may be spared. Lo! they arrive. Either some God inform'd them, or they saw, Themselves, the vessel of Telemachus Too swiftly passing to be reach'd by theirs. He spake; they, rising, hasted to the shore. Alert they drew the sable bark aground, And by his servant each his arms dispatch'd To his own home. Then all to council close Assembling, neither elder of the land Nor youth allow'd to join them, and the rest Eupithes' son, Antinoüs, thus bespake. Ah! how the Gods have rescued him! all day Perch'd on the airy mountain-top, our spies Successive watch'd; and when the sun declined, We never slept on shore, but all night long Till sacred dawn arose, plow'd the abyss, Hoping Telemachus, that we might seize And slay him, whom some Deity hath led, In our despight, safe to his home again. But frame we yet again means to destroy Telemachus; ah—let not Him escape! For end of this our task, while he survives, None shall be found, such prudence he displays And wisdom; neither are the people now Unanimous our friends as heretofore. Come, then—prevent him, ere he call the Greeks To council; for he will not long delay, But will be angry, doubtless, and will tell Amid them all, how we in vain devised His death, a deed which they will scarce applaud, But will, perhaps, punish and drive us forth From our own country to a distant land.— Prevent him, therefore, quickly; in the field Slay him, or on the road; so shall his wealth And his possessions on ourselves devolve, Which we will share equally, but his house Shall be the Queen's, and his whom she shall wed. Yet, if not so inclined, ye rather chuse That he should live and occupy entire His patrimony, then, no longer, here Assembled, let us revel at his cost, But let us all with spousal gifts produced From our respective treasures, woo the Queen, Leaving her in full freedom to espouse Who proffers most, and whom the fates ordain. He ceased; the assembly silent sat and mute. Then rose Amphinomus amid them all, Offspring renown'd of Nisus, son himself Of King Aretias. He had thither led The suitor train who from the pleasant isle Corn-clad of green Dulichium had arrived, And by his speech pleased far beyond them all Penelope, for he was just and wise, And thus, well-counselling the rest, began. Not I, my friends! far be the thought from me To slay Telemachus! it were a deed Momentous, terrible, to slay a prince. First, therefore, let us counsel ask of heaven, And if Jove's oracle that course approve, I will encourage you, and will myself Be active in his death; but if the Gods Forbid it, then, by my advice, forbear. So spake Amphinomus, whom all approved. Arising then, into Ulysses' house They went, where each his splendid seat resumed. A novel purpose occupied, meantime, Penelope; she purposed to appear Before her suitors, whose design to slay Telemachus she had from Medon learn'd, The herald, for his ear had caught the sound. Toward the hall with her attendant train She moved, and when, most graceful of her sex, Where sat the suitors she arrived, between The columns standing of the stately dome, And covering with her white veil's lucid folds Her features, to Antinoüs thus she spake. Antinoüs, proud, contentious, evermore To mischief prone! the people deem thee wise Past thy compeers, and in all grace of speech Preeminent, but such wast never thou. Inhuman! why is it thy dark design To slay Telemachus? and why with scorn Rejectest thou the suppliant's Alluding probably to entreaties made to him at some former time by herself and Telemachus, that he would not harm them. Clarke. prayer, which Jove Himself hath witness'd? Plots please not the Gods. Know'st not that thy own father refuge found Here, when he fled before the people's wrath Whom he had irritated by a wrong Which, with a band of Taphian robbers join'd, He offered to the Thesprots, our allies? They would have torn his heart, and would have laid All his delights and his possessions waste, But my Ulysses slaked the furious heat Of their revenge, whom thou requitest now Wasting his goods, soliciting his wife, Slaying his son, and filling me with woe. But cease, I charge thee, and bid cease the rest. To whom the son of Polybus replied, Eurymachus.—Icarius' daughter wise! Take courage, fair Penelope, and chace These fears unreasonable from thy mind! The man lives not, nor shall, who while I live, And faculty of sight retain, shall harm Telemachus, thy son. For thus I say, And thus will I perform; his blood shall stream A sable current from my lance's point That moment; for the city-waster Chief Ulysses, oft, me placing on his knees, Hath fill'd my infant grasp with savoury food, And given me ruddy wine. I, therefore, hold Telemachus of all men most my friend, Nor hath he death to fear from hand of ours. Yet, if the Gods shall doom him, die he must. So he encouraged her, who yet, himself, Plotted his death. She, re-ascending, sought Her stately chamber, and, arriving there, Deplored with tears her long-regretted Lord Till Athenæan Pallas azure-eyed Dews of soft slumber o'er her lids diffused. And now, at even-tide, Eumæus reach'd Ulysses and his son. A yearling swine Just slain they skilfully for food prepared, When Pallas, drawing nigh, smote with her wand Ulysses, at the stroke rendering him old, And his apparel sordid as before, Lest, knowing him, the swain at once should seek Penelope, and let the secret forth. Then foremost him Telemachus address'd. Noble Eumæus! thou art come; what news Bring'st from the city? Have the warrior band Of suitors, hopeless of their ambush, reach'd The port again, or wait they still for me? To whom Eumæus, thou didst thus reply. No time for such enquiry, nor to range, Curious, the streets had I, but anxious wish'd To make my message known, and to return. But, as it chanced, a nimble herald sent From thy companions, met me on the way, Who reach'd thy mother first. Yet this I know, For this I saw. Passing above the town Where they have piled a way-side hill of stones To Mercury, I beheld a gallant bark Entering the port; a bark she was of ours, The crew were numerous, and I mark'd her deep- Laden with shields and spears of double edge. Theirs I conjectured her, and could no more. He spake, and, by Eumæus unperceived, Telemachus his father eyed and smiled. Their task accomplish'd, and the table spread, They ate, nor any his due portion miss'd, And hunger now and thirst both sated, all To rest repair'd, and took the gift of sleep. BOOK XVII. ARGUMENT OF THE SEVENTEENTH BOOK. Telemachus returns to the city, and relates to his mother the principal passages of his voyage; Ulysses, conducted by Eumæus, arrives there also, and enters among the suitors, having been known only by his old dog Argus, who dies at his feet. The curiosity of Penelope being excited by the account which Eumæus gives her of Ulysses, she orders him immediately into her presence, but Ulysses postpones the interview till evening, when the suitors having left the palace, there shall be no danger of interruption. Eumæus returns to his cottage. Now look'd Aurora from the East abroad, When the illustrious offspring of divine Ulysses bound his sandals to his feet; He seized his sturdy spear match'd to his gripe, And to the city meditating quick Departure now, the swine-herd thus bespake. Father! I seek the city, to convince My mother of my safe return, whose tears, I judge, and lamentations shall not cease Till her own eyes behold me. But I lay On thee this charge. Into the city lead, Thyself, this hapless guest, that he may beg Provision there, a morsel and a drop From such as may, perchance, vouchsafe the boon. I cannot, vext and harrass'd as I am, Feed all, and should the stranger take offence, The worse for him. Plain truth is my delight. To whom Ulysses, ever wise, replied. Nor is it my desire to be detained. Better the mendicant in cities seeks His dole, vouchsafe it whosoever may, Than in the villages. I am not young, Nor longer of an age that well accords With rural tasks, nor could I all perform That it might please a master to command. Go then, and when I shall have warm'd my limbs Before the hearth, and when the risen sun Shall somewhat chase the cold, thy servant's task Shall be to guide me thither, as thou bidd'st. For this is a vile garb; the frosty air Of morning will benumb me thus attired, And, as ye say, the city is remote. He ended, and Telemachus in haste Set forth, his thoughts all teeming as he went, With dire revenge. Soon in the palace-courts Arriving, he reclined his spear against A column and proceeded to the hall. Him Euryclea, first, his nurse perceived, While on the variegated seats she spread Their fleecy covering; swift with tearful eyes She flew to him, and the whole female train Of brave Ulysses swarm'd around his son, Clasping him, and his forehead and his neck Kissing affectionate; then came herself, As golden Venus or Diana fair, Forth from her chamber to her son's embrace, The chaste Penelope; with tears she threw Her arms around him, his bright-beaming eyes And forehead kiss'd, and with a murmur'd plaint Maternal in wing'd accents thus began. Thou hast return'd, light of my eyes! my son! My loved Telemachus! I had no hope To see thee more when once thou hadst embark'd For Pylus, privily, and with no consent From me obtain'd, news seeking of thy sire. But haste; unfold. Declare what thou hast seen. To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied. Ah mother! let my sorrows rest, nor me From death so lately 'scaped afflict anew, But, bathed and habited in fresh attire, With all the maidens of thy train ascend To thy superior chamber, there to vow A perfect hecatomb to all the Gods, When Jove shall have avenged our numerous wrongs. I seek the forum, there to introduce A guest, my follower from the Pylian shore, Whom sending forward with my noble band, I bade Piræus to his own abode Lead him, and with all kindness entertain The stranger, till I should myself arrive. He spake, nor flew his words useless away. She, bathed and habited in fresh attire, Vow'd a full hecatomb to all the Gods, Would Jove but recompense her numerous wrongs. Then, spear in hand, went forth her son, two dogs Fleet-footed following him. O'er all his form Pallas diffused a dignity divine, And every eye gazed on him as he pass'd. The suitors throng'd him round, joy on their lips And welcome, but deep mischief in their hearts. He, shunning all that crowd, chose to himself A seat, where Mentor sat, and Antiphus, And Halytherses, long his father's friends Sincere, who of his voyage much enquired. Then drew Piræus nigh, leading his guest Toward the forum; nor Telemachus Stood long aloof, but greeted his approach, And was accosted by Piræus thus. Sir! send thy menial women to bring home The precious charge committed to my care, Thy gifts at Menelaus' hands received. To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied. Piræus! wait; for I not yet foresee The upshot. Should these haughty ones effect My death, clandestine, under my own roof, And parcel my inheritance by lot, I rather wish those treasures thine, than theirs. But should I with success plan for them all A bloody death, then, wing'd with joy, thyself Bring home those presents to thy joyful friend. So saying, he led the anxious stranger thence Into the royal mansion, where arrived, Each cast his mantle on a couch or throne, And plunged his feet into a polish'd bath. There wash'd and lubricated with smooth oils, From the attendant maidens each received Tunic and shaggy mantle. Thus attired, Forth from the baths they stepp'd, and sat again. A maiden, next, with golden ewer charged, And silver bowl, pour'd water on their hands, And spread the polish'd table, which with food Of all kinds, remnants of the last regale, The mistress of the household charge supplied. Meantime, beside a column of the dome His mother, on a couch reclining, twirl'd Her slender threads. They to the furnish'd board Stretch'd forth their hands, and hunger now and thirst Both satisfied, Penelope began. Telemachus! I will ascend again, And will repose me on my woeful bed; For such it hath been, and with tears of mine Ceaseless bedew'd, e'er since Ulysses went With Atreus' sons to Troy. For not a word Thou would'st vouchsafe me till our haughty guests Had occupied the house again, of all That thou hast heard (if aught indeed thou hast,) Of thy long-absent father's wish'd return. Her answer'd then Telemachus discrete. Mother! at thy request I will with truth Relate the whole. At Pylus' shore arrived We Nestor found, chief of the Pylian race. Receiving me in his august abode, He entertain'd me with such welcome kind As a glad father shews to his own son Long-lost and newly found; so Nestor me, And his illustrious offspring, entertain'd, But yet assured me that he nought had heard From mortal lips of my magnanimous sire, Whether alive or dead; with his own steeds He sent me, and with splendid chariot thence To spear-famed Menelaus, Atreus' son. There saw I Helen, by the Gods' decree Authoress of trouble both to Greece and Troy. The Hero Menelaus then enquired What cause had urged me to the pleasant vale Of Lacedæmon; plainly I rehearsed The occasion, and the Hero thus replied. Ye Gods! they are ambitious of the bed Of a brave man, however base themselves. But, as it chances when the hart hath laid Her fawns new-yean'd and sucklings yet, to rest In some resistless lion's den, she roams Meantime the hills, and in the grassy vales Feeds heedless, but the lion to his lair Returning soon, both her and hers destroys, So shall thy father, brave Ulysses, them. Jove! Pallas! and Apollo! oh that such As erst in well-built Lesbos, where he strove With Philomelides, whom wrestling, flat He threw, when all Achaia's sons rejoiced, Ulysses now might mingle with his foes! Short life and bitter nuptials should be theirs. But thy inquiries neither indirect Will I evade, nor give thee false reply, But all that from the Ancient Proteus. of the Deep I have received will utter, hiding nought. The God declared that he had seen thy sire In a lone island, sorrowing, and detain'd An inmate in the grotto of the nymph Calypso, wanting also means by which To reach the country of his birth again, For neither gallant barks nor friends had he To speed his passage o'er the boundless waves. So Menelaüs spake, the spear-renown'd. My errand thus accomplish'd, I return'd,— And by the Gods with gales propitious blest, Was wafted swiftly to my native shore. He spake, and tumult in his mother's heart So speaking, raised. Consolatory, next, The godlike Theoclymenus began. Consort revered of Laertiades! Little the Spartan knew, but list to me, For I will plainly prophesy and sure. Be Jove of all in heaven my witness first, Then, this thy hospitable board, and, last, The household Gods of the illustrious Chief Ulysses, at whose heart The hearth was the altar on which the lares or household gods were worshipped. I have arrived, That, even now, within his native isle Ulysses somewhere sits, or creeps obscure, Witness of these enormities, and seeds Sowing of dire destruction for his foes; So sure an augury, while on the deck Reclining of the gallant bark, I saw, And with loud voice proclaim'd it to thy son. Him answer'd then Penelope discrete. Grant heaven, my guest, that this good word of thine Fail not! then shalt thou soon such bounty share And friendship at my hands, that at first sight Whoe'er shall meet thee shall pronounce thee blest. Thus they conferr'd. Meantime the suitors hurl'd The quoit and lance on the smooth area spread Before Ulysses' gate, the custom'd scene Of their contentions, sports, and clamours rude. But when the hour of supper now approach'd, And from the pastures on all sides the sheep Came with their wonted drivers, Medon then (For he of all the heralds pleased them most, And waited at the board) them thus address'd. Enough of play, young princes! entering now The house, prepare we sedulous our feast, Since in well-timed refreshment harm is none. He spake, whose admonition pleased. At once All rising sought the palace; there arrived, Each cast his mantle off, which on his throne Or couch he spread, then brisk to slaughter fell Of many a victim; sheep and goats and brawns They slew, all fatted, and a pastured ox, Hastening the banquet; nor with less dispatch Ulysses and Eumæus now prepared To seek the town, when thus the swain began. My guest! since thy fixt purpose is to seek This day the city as my master bade, Though I, in truth, much rather wish thee here A keeper of our herds, yet through respect And reverence of his orders, whose reproof I dread, for masters seldom gently chide, I would be gone. Arise, let us depart, For day already is far-spent, and soon The air of even-tide will chill thee more. To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied. It is enough. I understand. Thou speak'st To one intelligent. Let us depart, And lead, thyself, the way; but give me, first, (If thou have one already hewn,) a staff To lean on, for ye have described the road Rugged, and oftimes dangerous to the foot. So saying, his tatter'd wallet o'er his back He cast, suspended by a leathern twist, Eumæus gratified him with a staff, And forth they went, leaving the cottage kept By dogs and swains. He city-ward his King Led on, in form a squalid beggar old, Halting, and in unseemly garb attired. But when, slow-travelling the craggy way, They now approach'd the town, and had attain'd The marble fountain deep, which with its streams Pellucid all the citizens supplied, (Ithacus had that fountain framed of old With Neritus and Polyctor, over which A grove of water-nourish'd alders hung Circular on all sides, while cold the rill Ran from the rock, on whose tall summit stood The altar of the nymphs, by all who pass'd With sacrifice frequented, still, and prayer;) Melanthius, son of Dolius, at that fount Met them; the chosen goats of every flock, With two assistants, from the field he drove, The suitors' supper. He, seeing them both, In surly accent boorish, such as fired Ulysses with resentment, thus began. Ay—this is well—the villain leads the vile;— Thus evermore the Gods join like to like. Thou clumsy swine-herd, whither would'st conduct This morsel-hunting mendicant obscene, Defiler base of banquets? many a post Shall he rub smooth that props him while he begs Lean alms, sole object of his low pursuit, Who ne'er to sword or tripod yet aspired. Would'st thou afford him to me for a guard Or sweeper of my stalls, or to supply My kids with leaves, he should on bulkier thewes Supported stand, though nourish'd but with whey. But no such useful arts hath he acquired, Nor likes he work, but rather much to extort From others food for his unsated maw. But mark my prophesy, for it is true, At famed Ulysses' house should he arrive, His sides shall shatter many a footstool hurl'd Against them by the offended princes there. He spake, and drawing nigh, with his raised foot, Insolent as he was and brutish, smote Ulysses' haunch, yet shook not from his path The firm-set Chief, who doubtful mused awhile Whether to rush on him, and with his staff To slay him, or uplifting him on high, Downward to dash him headlong; but his wrath Restraining, calm he suffer'd the affront. Him then Eumæus with indignant look Rebuking, raised his hands, and fervent pray'd. Nymphs of the fountains, progeny of Jove! If e'er Ulysses on your altar burn'd The thighs of fatted lambs or kidlings, grant This my request. O let the Hero soon, Conducted by some Deity, return! So shall he quell that arrogance which safe Thou now indulgest, roaming day by day The city, while bad shepherds mar the flocks. To whom the goat-herd answer thus return'd Melanthius. Marvellous! how rare a speech The subtle cur hath framed! whom I will send Far hence at a convenient time on board My bark, and sell him at no little gain. I would, that he who bears the silver bow As sure might pierce Telemachus this day In his own house, or that the suitors might, As that same wanderer shall return no more! He said, and them left pacing slow along, But soon, himself, at his Lord's house arrived; There entering bold, he with the suitors sat Opposite to Eurymachus, for him He valued most. The sewers his portion placed Of meat before him, and the maiden, chief Directress of the household, gave him bread. And now, Ulysses, with the swain his friend Approach'd, when, hearing the harmonious lyre, Both stood, for Phemius had begun his song. He grasp'd the swine-herd's hand, and thus he said. This house, Eumæus! of Ulysses seems Passing magnificent, and to be known With ease for his among a thousand more. One pile supports another, and a wall Crested with battlements surrounds the court; Firm too the folding doors all force of man Defy; but numerous guests, as I perceive, Now feast within; witness the savoury steam Fast-fuming upward, and the sounding harp, Divine associate of the festive board. To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply. Thou hast well guess'd; no wonder; thou art quick On every theme; but let us well forecast This business. Wilt thou, entering first thyself The splendid mansion, with the suitors mix, Me leaving here? or shall I lead the way While thou remain'st behind? yet linger not, Lest seeing thee without, some servant strike Or drive thee hence. Consider which were best. Him answer'd then the patient Hero bold. It is enough. I understand. Thou speak'st To one intelligent. Lead thou the way Me leaving here, for neither stripes nor blows To me are strange. Much exercised with pain In fight and on the Deep, I have long since Learn'd patience. Follow next what follow may! But to suppress the appetite, I deem Impossible; the stomach is a source Of ills to man, an avaricious gulf Destructive, which to satiate, ships are rigg'd, Seas traversed, and fierce battles waged remote. Thus they discoursing stood; Argus the while, Ulysses' dog, uplifted where he lay His head and ears erect. Ulysses him Had bred long since himself, but rarely used, Departing first to Ilium. Him the youths In other days led frequent to the chace Of wild goat, hart, and hare; but now he lodged A poor old cast-off, of his Lord forlorn, Where mules and oxen had before the gate Much ordure left, with which Ulysses' hinds Should, in due time, manure his spacious fields. There lay, with dog-devouring vermin foul All over, Argus; soon as he perceived Long-lost Ulysses nigh, down fell his ears Clapp'd close, and with his tail glad sign he gave Of gratulation, impotent to rise And to approach his master as of old. Ulysses, noting him, wiped off a tear Unmark'd, and of Eumæus quick enquired. I can but wonder seeing such a dog Thus lodged, Eumæus! beautiful in form He is, past doubt, but whether he hath been As fleet as fair I know not; rather such Perchance as masters sometimes keep to grace Their tables, nourish'd more for show than use. To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply. He is the dog of one dead far remote. But had he now such feat-performing strength As when Ulysses left him going hence To Ilium, in one moment thou shouldst mark, Astonish'd his agility and force. He never in the sylvan deep recess The wild beast saw that 'scaped him, and he track'd Their steps infallible; but he hath now No comfort, for (the master dead afar,) The heedless servants care not for his dog. Domestics, missing once their Lord's controul, Grow wilful, and refuse their proper tasks; For whom Jove dooms to servitude, he takes At once the half of that man's worth away. He said, and, entering at the portal, join'd The suitors. Then his destiny released Old Argus, soon as he had lived to see Ulysses in the twentieth year restored. Godlike Telemachus, long ere the rest, Marking the swine-herd's entrance, with a nod Summon'd him to approach. Eumæus cast His eye around, and seeing vacant there The seat which the dispenser of the feast Was wont to occupy while he supplied The numerous guests, planted it right before Telemachus, and at his table sat, On which the herald placed for him his share Of meat, and from the baskets gave him bread. Soon after him, Ulysses enter'd slow The palace, like a squalid beggar old, Staff-propp'd, and in loose tatters foul attired. Within the portal on the ashen sill He sat, and seeming languid, lean'd against A cypress pillar by the builder's art Polish'd long since, and planted at the door. Then took Telemachus a loaf entire Forth from the elegant basket, and of flesh A portion large as his two hands contain'd, And beck'ning close the swine-herd, charged him thus. These to the stranger; whom advise to ask Some dole from every suitor; bashful fear Ill suits the mendicant by want oppress'd. He spake; Eumæus went, and where he sat Arriving, in wing'd accents thus began. Telemachus, oh stranger, sends thee these, And counsels thee to importune for more The suitors, one by one; for bashful fear Ill suits the mendicant by want oppress'd. To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied. Jove, King of all, grant every good on earth To kind Telemachus, and the complete Accomplishment of all that he desires! He said, and with both hands outspread, the mess Receiving as he sat, on his worn bag Disposed it at his feet. Long as the bard Chaunted, he ate, and when he ceased to eat, Then also ceased the bard divine to sing. And now ensued loud clamour in the hall And tumult, when Minerva, drawing nigh To Laertiades, impell'd the Chief Crusts to collect, or any pittance small At every suitor's hand, for trial's sake Of just and unjust; yet deliverance none From evil she design'd for any there. From left to right That he might begin auspiciously. Wine was served in the same direction. F. his progress he began Petitioning, with outstretch'd hands, the throng, As one familiar with the beggar's art. They pitying gave to him, but view'd him still With wonder, and enquiries mutual made Who, and whence was he? Then the goat-herd rose Melanthius, and the assembly thus address'd. Hear me, ye suitors of the illustrious Queen! This guest, of whom ye ask, I have beheld Elsewhere; the swine-herd brought him; but himself I know not, neither who nor whence he is. So he; then thus Antinoüs stern rebuked The swine-herd. Ah, notorious as thou art, Why hast thou shewn this vagabond the way Into the city? are we not enough Infested with these troublers of our feasts? Deem'st it a trifle that such numbers eat At thy Lord's cost, and hast thou, therefore, led This fellow hither, found we know not where? To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply. Antinoüs! though of high degree, thou speak'st Not wisely. What man to another's house Repairs to invite him to a feast, unless He be of those who by profession serve The public, prophet, healer of disease, Ingenious artist, or some bard divine Whose music may exhilarate the guests? These, and such only, are in every land Call'd to the banquet; none invites the poor, Who much consume, and no requital yield. But thou of all the suitors roughly treat'st Ulysses' servants most, and chiefly me; Yet thee I heed not, while the virtuous Queen Dwells in this palace, and her godlike son. To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied. Peace! answer not verbose a man like him. Antinoüs hath a tongue accustom'd much To tauntings, and promotes them in the rest. Then, turning to Antinoüs, quick he said— Antinoüs! as a father for his son Takes thought, so thou for me, who bidd'st me chase The stranger harshly hence; but God Here again ???? occurs in the abstract. forbid! Impart to him. I grudge not, but myself Exhort thee to it; neither, in this cause, Fear thou the Queen, or in the least regard Whatever menial throughout all the house Of famed Ulysses. Ah! within thy breast Dwells no such thought; thou lovest not to impart To others, but to gratify thyself. To whom Antinoüs answer thus return'd. High-soaring and intemperate in thy speech How hast thou said, Telemachus? Would all As much bestow on him, he should not seek Admittance here again three months to come. So saying, he seized the stool which, banquetting, He press'd with his nice feet, and from beneath The table forth advanced it into view. The rest all gave to him, with bread and flesh Filling his wallet, and Ulysses, now, Returning to his threshold, there to taste The bounty of the Greeks, paused in his way Beside Antinoüs, whom he thus address'd. Kind sir, vouchsafe to me! for thou appear'st Not least, but greatest of the Achaians here, And hast a kingly look. It might become Thee therefore above others to bestow, So should I praise thee wheresoe'er I roam. I also lived the happy owner once Of such a stately mansion, and have given To numerous wanderers (whencesoe'er they came) All that they needed; I was also served By many, and enjoy'd all that denotes The envied owner opulent and blest. But Jove (for so it pleased him) hath reduced My all to nothing, prompting me, in league With rovers of the Deep, to sail afar To Ægypt, for my sure destruction there. Within the Ægyptian stream my barks well oar'd I station'd, and, enjoining strict my friends To watch them close-attendant at their side, Commanded spies into the hill-tops; but they, Under the impulse of a spirit rash And hot for quarrel, the well-cultured fields Pillaged of the Ægyptians, captive led Their wives and little-ones, and slew the men. Ere long, the loud alarm their city reach'd. Down came the citizens, by dawn of day, With horse and foot and with the gleam of arms Filling the plain. Then Jove with panic dread Struck all my people; none found courage more To stand, for mischiefs swarm'd on every side. There, numerous by the glittering spear we fell Slaughter'd, while others they conducted thence Alive to servitude; but me they gave To Dmetor, King in Cyprus, Jasus' son; He entertain'd me liberally, and thence This land I reach'd, but poor and woe-begone. Then answer thus Antinoüs harsh return'd. What dæmon introduced this nuisance here, This troubler of our feast? stand yonder, keep Due distance from my table, or expect To see an Ægypt and a Cyprus worse Than those, bold mendicant and void of shame! Thou hauntest each, and inconsiderate each Gives to thee, because gifts at others cost Are cheap, and, plentifully served themselves, They squander, heedless, viands not their own. To whom Ulysses while he slow retired. Gods! how illiberal with that specious form! Thou wouldst not grant the poor a grain of salt From thy own board, who at another's fed So nobly, canst not spare a crust to me. He spake; then raged Antinoüs still the more, And in wing'd accents, louring, thus replied. Take such dismission now as thou deservest, Opprobrious! hast thou dared to scoff at me? So saying, he seized his stool, and on the joint Of his right shoulder smote him; firm as rock He stood, by no such force to be displaced, But silent shook his brows, and dreadful deeds Of vengeance ruminating, sought again His seat the threshold, where his bag full-charged He grounded, and the suitors thus address'd. Hear now, ye suitors of the matchless Queen, My bosom's dictates. Trivial is the harm, Scarce felt, if, fighting for his own, his sheep Perchance, or beeves, a man receive a blow. But me Antinoüs struck for that I ask'd Food from him merely to appease the pangs Of hunger, source of numerous ills to man. If then the poor man have a God to avenge His wrongs, I pray to him that death may seize Antinoüs, ere his nuptial hour arrive! To whom Antinoüs answer thus return'd, Son of Eupithes. Either seated there Or going hence, eat, stranger, and be still; Lest for thy insolence, by hand or foot We drag thee forth, and thou be flay'd alive. He ceased, whom all indignant heard, and thus Even his own proud companions censured him. Antinoüs! thou didst not well to smite The wretched vagabond. O thou art doom'd For ever, if there be a God in heaven ?? ?? ??? ??? ?????????? ???? ????. Eustathius, and Clarke after him, understand an aposiopesis here, as if the speaker meant to say—what if there should be? or—suppose there should be? But the sentence seems to fall in better with what follows interpreted as above, and it is a sense of the passage not unwarranted by the opinion of other commentators. —See Schaufelbergerus.; For in similitude of strangers oft, The Gods, who can with ease all shapes assume, Repair to populous cities, where they mark The outrageous and the righteous deeds of men. So they, for whose reproof he little cared. But in his heart Telemachus that blow Resented, anguish-torn, yet not a tear He shed, but silent shook his brows, and mused Terrible things. Penelope, meantime, Told of the wanderer so abused beneath Her roof, among her maidens thus exclaim'd. So may Apollo, glorious archer, smite Thee also! Then Eurynome replied, Oh might our prayers prevail, none of them all Should see bright-charioted Aurora more. Her answer'd then Penelope discrete. Nurse! they are odious all, for that alike All teem with mischief! but Antinoüs' looks Remind me ever of the gloom of death. A stranger hath arrived who, begging, roams The house, (for so his penury enjoins) The rest have given him, and have fill'd his bag With viands, but Antinoüs hath bruised His shoulder with a foot-stool hurl'd at him. While thus the Queen conversing with her train In her own chamber sat, Ulysses made Plenteous repast. Then calling to her side Eumæus, thus she signified her will. Eumæus, noble friend! bid now approach Yon stranger. I would speak with him, and ask If he have seen Ulysses, or have heard Tidings, perchance, of the afflicted Chief, For much a wanderer by his garb he seems. To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply. Were those Achaians silent, thou should'st hear, O Queen! a tale that would console thy heart. Three nights I housed him, and within my cot Three days detain'd him, (for his ship he left A fugitive, and came direct to me,) But half untold his history still remains. As when his eye one fixes on a bard From heaven instructed in such themes as charm The ear of mortals, ever as he sings The people press insatiable to hear, So, in my cottage, seated at my side, That stranger with his tale enchanted me. Laertes, he affirms, hath been his guest Erewhile in Crete, where Minos' race resides. And thence he hath arrived, after great loss, A suppliant to the very earth abased; He adds, that in Thesprotia's neighbour realm He of Ulysses heard, both that he lives, And that he comes laden with riches home. To whom Penelope, discrete, replied. Haste; call him. I would hear myself his tale. Meantime, let these, or in the palace gate Sport jocular, or here; their hearts are light, For their possessions are secure; their wine None drinks, or eats their viands, save their own; While my abode, day after day, themselves Haunting, my beeves and sheep, and fatted goats Slay for the banquet, and my casks exhaust Extravagant, whence endless waste ensues; For no such friend as was Ulysses once Have I to expel the mischief. But might he Revisit once his native shores again, Then, aided by his son, he should avenge, Incontinent, the wrongs which now I mourn. Then sneezed Telemachus with sudden force, That all the palace rang; his mother laugh'd, And in wing'd accents thus the swain bespake. Haste—bid him hither—heard'st thou not the sneeze Propitious of my son? oh might it prove A presage of inevitable death To all these revellers! may none escape! Now mark me well. Should the event his tale Confirm, at my own hands he shall receive Mantle and tunic both for his reward. She spake; he went, and where Ulysses sat Arriving, in wing'd accents thus began. Penelope, my venerable friend! Calls thee, the mother of Telemachus. Oppress'd by numerous troubles, she desires To ask thee tidings of her absent Lord. And should the event verify thy report, Thy meed shall be (a boon which much thou need'st) Tunic and mantle; but she gives no more; Thy sustenance This seems added by Eumæus to cut off from Ulysses the hope that might otherwise tempt him to use fiction. thou must, as now, obtain, Begging it at their hands who chuse to give. Then thus Ulysses, Hero toil-inured. Eumæus! readily I can relate Truth, and truth only, to the prudent Queen Icarius' daughter; for of him I know Much, and have suffer'd sorrows like his own. But dread I feel of this imperious throng Perverse, whose riot and outrageous acts Of violence echo through the vault of heaven. And even now, when for no fault of mine Yon suitor struck me as I pass'd, and fill'd My flesh with pain, neither Telemachus Nor any interposed to stay his arm. Now, therefore, let Penelope, although Impatient, till the sun descend postpone Her questions; then she may enquire secure When comes her husband, and may nearer place My seat to the hearth-side, for thinly clad Thou know'st I am, whose aid I first implored. He ceased; at whose reply Eumæus sought Again the queen, but ere he yet had pass'd The threshold, thus she greeted his return. Comest thou alone, Eumæus? why delays The invited wanderer? dreads he other harm? Or sees he aught that with a bashful awe Fills him? the bashful poor are poor indeed. To whom, Eumæus, thou didst thus reply. He hath well spoken; none who would decline The rudeness of this contumelious throng Could answer otherwise; thee he entreats To wait till sun-set, and that course, O Queen, Thou shalt thyself far more commodious find, To hold thy conference with the guest, alone. Then answer thus Penelope return'd. The stranger, I perceive, is not unwise, Whoe'er he be, for on the earth are none Proud, insolent, and profligate as these. So spake the Queen. Then (all his message told) The good Eumæus to the suitors went Again, and with his head inclined toward Telemachus, lest others should his words Witness, in accents wing'd him thus address'd. Friend and kind master! I return to keep My herds, and to attend my rural charge, Whence we are both sustain'd. Keep thou, meantime, All here with vigilance, but chiefly watch For thy own good, and save thyself from harm; For numerous here brood mischief, whom the Gods Exterminate, ere yet their plots prevail! To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied. So be it, father! and (thy evening-mess Eaten) depart; to-morrow come again, Bringing fair victims hither; I will keep, I and the Gods, meantime, all here secure. He ended; then resumed once more the swain His polish'd seat, and both with wine and food Now satiate, to his charge return'd, the court Leaving and all the palace throng'd with guests; They (for it now was evening) all alike Turn'd jovial to the song and to the dance. BOOK XVIII. ARGUMENT OF THE EIGHTEENTH BOOK. The beggar Irus arrives at the palace; a combat takes place between him and Ulysses, in which Irus is by one blow vanquished. Penelope appears to the suitors, and having reminded them of the presents which she had a right to expect from them, receives a gift from each. Eurymachus, provoked by a speech of Ulysses, flings a footstool at him, which knocks down the cup-bearer; a general tumult is the consequence, which continues until by the advice of Telemachus, seconded by Amphinomus, the suitors retire to their respective homes. Now came a public mendicant, a man Accustom'd, seeking alms, to roam the streets Of Ithaca; one never sated yet With food or drink; yet muscle had he none, Or strength of limb, though giant-built in show. Arnæus was the name which at his birth His mother gave him, but the youthful band Of suitors, whom as messenger he served, All named him Irus. He, arriving, sought To drive Ulysses forth from his own home, And in rough accents rude him thus rebuked. Forth from the porch, old man! lest by the foot I drag thee quickly forth. Seest not how all Wink on me, and by signs give me command To drag thee hence? nor is it aught but shame That checks me. Yet arise, lest soon with fists Thou force me to adjust our difference. To whom Ulysses, louring dark, replied. Peace, fellow! neither word nor deed of mine Wrongs thee, nor feel I envy at the boon, However plentiful, which thou receivest. The sill may hold us both; thou dost not well To envy others; thou appear'st like me A vagrant; plenty is the gift of heaven. But urge me not to trial of our fists, Lest thou provoke me, and I stain with blood Thy bosom and thy lips, old as I am. So, my attendance should to-morrow prove More tranquil here; for thou should'st leave, I judge, Ulysses' mansion, never to return. Then answer'd Irus, kindling with disdain. Gods! with what volubility of speech The table-hunter prates, like an old hag Collied with chimney-smutch! but ah beware! For I intend thee mischief, and to dash With both hands every grinder from thy gums, As men untooth a pig pilfering the corn. Come—gird thee, that all here may view the strife— But how wilt thou oppose one young as I? Thus on the threshold of the lofty gate They, wrangling, chafed each other, whose dispute The high-born youth Antinoüs mark'd; he laugh'd Delighted, and the suitors thus address'd. Oh friends! no pastime ever yet occurr'd Pleasant as this which, now, the Gods themselves Afford us. Irus and the stranger brawl As they would box. Haste—let us urge them on. He said; at once loud-laughing all arose; The ill-clad disputants they round about Encompass'd, and Antinoüs thus began. Attend, ye noble suitors, to my voice. Two paunches lie of goats here on the fire, Which fill'd with fat and blood we set apart For supper; he who conquers, and in force Superior proves, shall freely take the paunch Which he prefers, and shall with us thenceforth Feast always; neither will we here admit Poor man beside to beg at our repasts. He spake, whom all approved; next, artful Chief Ulysses thus, dissembling, them address'd. Princes! unequal is the strife between A young man and an old with misery worn; But hunger, always counsellor of ill, Me moves to fight, that many a bruise received, I may be foil'd at last. Now swear ye all A solemn oath, that none, for Irus' sake Shall, interposing, smite me with his fist Clandestine, forcing me to yield the prize. He ceased, and, as he bade, all present swore A solemn oath; then thus, amid them all Standing, Telemachus majestic spake. Guest! if thy courage and thy manly mind Prompt thee to banish this man hence, no force Fear thou beside, for who smites thee, shall find Yet other foes to cope with; I am here In the host's office, and the royal Chiefs Eurymachus and Antinoüs, alike Discrete, accord unanimous with me. He ceased, whom all approved. Then, with his rags Ulysses braced for decency his loins Around, but gave to view his brawny thighs Proportion'd fair, and stripp'd his shoulders broad, His chest and arms robust; while, at his side, Dilating more the Hero's limbs and more Minerva stood; the assembly with fixt eyes Astonish'd gazed on him, and looking full On his next friend, a suitor thus remark'd. Irus shall be in Irus found no more. He hath pull'd evil on himself. What thewes And what a haunch the senior's tatters hid! So he,—meantime in Irus' heart arose Horrible tumult; yet, his loins by force Girding, the servants dragg'd him to the fight Pale, and his flesh all quivering as he came; Whose terrors thus Antinoüs sharp rebuked. Now, wherefore livest, and why wast ever born Thou mountain-mass of earth! if such dismay Shake thee at thought of combat with a man Ancient as he, and worn with many woes? But mark, I threaten not in vain; should he O'ercome thee, and in force superior prove, To Echetus thou goest; my sable bark Shall waft thee to Epirus, where he reigns Enemy of mankind; of nose and ears He shall despoil thee with his ruthless steel, Tradition says that Echetus, for a love-affair, condemned his daughter to lose her eyes, and to grind iron barley-grains, while her lover was doomed to suffer what Antinoüs threatens to Irus. F.And tearing by the roots the parts away That mark thy sex, shall cast them to the dogs. He said; His limbs new terrors at that sound Shook under him; into the middle space They led him, and each raised his hands on high. Then doubtful stood Ulysses toil-inured, Whether to strike him lifeless to the earth At once, or fell him with a managed blow. To smite with managed force at length he chose As wisest, lest, betray'd by his own strength, He should be known. With elevated fists Both stood; him Irus on the shoulder struck, But he his adversary on the neck Pash'd close beneath his ear; he split the bones, And blood in sable streams ran from his mouth. With many an hideous yell he dropp'd, his teeth Chatter'd, and with his heels he drumm'd the ground. The wooers, at that sight, lifting their hands In glad surprise, laugh'd all their breath away. Then, through the vestibule, and right across The court, Ulysses dragg'd him by the foot Into the portico, where propping him Against the wall, and giving him his staff, In accents wing'd he bade him thus farewell. There seated now, dogs drive and swine away, Nor claim (thyself so base) supreme control O'er other guests and mendicants, lest harm Reach thee, hereafter, heavier still than this. So saying, his tatter'd wallet o'er his back He threw suspended by its leathern twist, And toward the threshold turning, sat again. They laughing ceaseless still, the palace-door Re-enter'd, and him, courteous, thus bespake. Jove, and all Jove's assessors in the skies Vouchsafe thee, stranger, whatsoe'er it be, Thy heart's desire! who hast our ears relieved From that insatiate beggar's irksome tone. Soon to Epirus he shall go, dispatch'd To Echetus the King, pest of mankind. So they; to whose propitious words the Chief Listen'd delighted. Then Antinoüs placed The paunch before him, and Amphinomus Two loaves, selected from the rest; he fill'd A goblet also, drank to him, and said, My father, hail! O stranger, be thy lot Hereafter blest, though adverse now and hard! To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied. To me, Amphinomus, endued thou seem'st With much discretion, who art also son Of such a sire, whose fair report I know, Dulichian Nysus opulent and good. Fame speaks thee his, and thou appear'st a man Judicious; hear me, therefore; mark me well. Earth nourishes, of all that breathe or creep, No creature weak as man; for while the Gods Grant him prosperity and health, no fear Hath he, or thought, that he shall ever mourn; But when the Gods with evils unforeseen Smite him, he bears them with a grudging mind; For such as the complexion of his lot By the appointment of the Sire of all, Such is the colour of the mind of man. I, too, have been familiar in my day With wealth and ease, but I was then self-will'd, And many wrong'd, embolden'd by the thought Of my own father's and my brethren's power. Let no man, therefore, be unjust, but each Use modestly what gift soe'er of heaven. So do not these. These ever bent I see On deeds injurious, the possessions large Consuming, and dishonouring the wife Of one, who will not, as I judge, remain Long absent from his home, but is, perchance, Even at the door. Thee, therefore, may the Gods Steal hence in time; ah, meet not his return To his own country! for they will not part, (He and the suitors) without blood, I think, If once he enter at these gates again! He ended, and libation pouring, quaff'd The generous juice, then in the prince's hand Replaced the cup; he, pensive, and his head Inclining low, pass'd from him; for his heart Foreboded ill; yet 'scaped not even he, But in the snare of Pallas caught, his life To the heroic arm and spear resign'd Of brave Telemachus. Reaching, at length, The seat whence he had risen, he sat again. Minerva then, Goddess cœrulean-eyed, Prompted Icarius' daughter to appear Before the suitors; so to expose the more Their drift iniquitous, and that herself More bright than ever in her husband's eyes Might shine, and in her son's. Much mirth she feign'd This seems the sort of laughter intended by the word ???????., And bursting into laughter, thus began. I wish, Eurynome! (who never felt That wish till now) though I detest them all, To appear before the suitors, in whose ears I will admonish, for his good, my son, Not to associate with that lawless crew Too much, who speak him fair, but foul intend. Then answer thus Eurynome return'd. My daughter! wisely hast thou said and well. Go! bathe thee and anoint thy face, then give To thy dear son such counsel as thou wilt Without reserve; but show not there thy cheeks Sullied with tears, for profit none accrues From grief like thine, that never knows a change. And he is now bearded, and hath attain'd That age which thou wast wont with warmest prayer To implore the Gods that he might live to see. Her answer'd, then, Penelope discrete. Persuade not me, though studious of my good, To bathe, Eurynome! or to anoint My face with oil; for all my charms the Gods Inhabitants of Olympus then destroy'd When he, embarking, left me. Go, command Hippodamia and Autonöe That they attend me to the hall, and wait Beside me there; for decency forbids That I should enter to the men, alone. She ceased, and through the house the ancient dame Hasted to summon whom she had enjoin'd. But Pallas, Goddess of the azure eyes, Diffused, meantime, the kindly dew of sleep Around Icarius' daughter; on her couch Reclining, soon as she reclined, she dozed, And yielded to soft slumber all her frame. Then, that the suitors might admire her more, The glorious Goddess cloathed her, as she lay, With beauty of the skies; her lovely face She with ambrosia purified, with such As Cytherea chaplet-crown'd employs Herself, when in the eye-ensnaring dance She joins the Graces; to a statelier height Beneath her touch, an ampler size she grew, And fairer than the elephantine bone Fresh from the carver's hand. These gifts conferr'd Divine, the awful Deity retired. And now, loud-prattling as they came, arrived Her handmaids; sleep forsook her at the sound, She wiped away a tear, and thus she said. Me gentle sleep, sad mourner as I am, Hath here involved. O would that by a death As gentle chaste Diana would herself This moment set me free, that I might waste My life no longer in heart-felt regret Of a lamented husband's various worth And virtue, for in Greece no Peer had he! She said, and through her chambers' stately door Issuing, descended; neither went she sole, But with those two fair menials of her train. Arriving, most majestic of her sex, In presence of the numerous guests, beneath The portal of the stately dome she stood Between her maidens, with her lucid veil Mantling her lovely cheeks. Then, every knee Trembled, and every heart with amorous heat Dissolved, her charms all coveting alike, While to Telemachus her son she spake. Telemachus! thou art no longer wise As once thou wast, and even when a child. For thriven as thou art, and at full size Arrived of man, so fair-proportion'd too, That even a stranger, looking on thy growth And beauty, would pronounce thee nobly born, Yet is thy intellect still immature. For what is this? why suffer'st thou a guest To be abused in thy own palace? how? Know'st not that if the stranger seated here Endure vexation, the disgrace is thine? Her answer'd then Telemachus discrete. I blame thee not, my mother, that thou feel'st Thine anger moved; yet want I not a mind Able to mark and to discern between Evil and good, child as I lately was, Although I find not promptitude of thought Sufficient always, overawed and check'd By such a multitude, all bent alike On mischief, of whom none takes part with me. But Irus and the stranger have not fought, Urged by the suitors, and the stranger proved Victorious; yes—Heaven knows how much I wish That, (in the palace some, some in the court,) The suitors all sat vanquish'd, with their heads Depending low, and with enfeebled limbs, Even as that same Irus, while I speak, With chin on bosom propp'd at the hall-gate Sits drunkard-like, incapable to stand Erect, or to regain his proper home. So they; and now addressing to the Queen His speech, Eurymachus thus interposed. O daughter of Icarius! could all eyes Throughout Iäsian From Iäsus, once King of Peloponnesus. Argos view thy charms, Discrete Penelope! more suitors still Assembling in thy courts would banquet here From morn to eve; for thou surpassest far In beauty, stature, worth, all womankind. To whom replied Penelope discrete. The Gods, Eurymachus! reduced to nought My virtue, beauty, stature, when the Greeks, Whom my Ulysses follow'd, sail'd to Troy. Could he, returning, my domestic charge Himself intend, far better would my fame Be so secured, and wider far diffused. But I am wretched now, such storms the Gods Of woe have sent me. When he left his home, Clasping my wrist with his right hand, he said. My love! for I imagine not that all The warrior Greeks shall safe from Troy return, Since fame reports the Trojans brave in fight, Skill'd in the spear, mighty to draw the bow, And nimble vaulters to the backs of steeds High-mettled, which to speediest issue bring The dreadful struggle of all-wasting war,— I know not, therefore, whether Heaven intend My safe return, or I must perish there. But manage thou at home. Cherish, as now, While I am absent, or more dearly still My parents, and what time our son thou seest Mature, then wed; wed even whom thou wilt, And hence to a new home.—Such were his words, All which shall full accomplishment ere long Receive. The day is near, when hapless I, Lost to all comfort by the will of Jove, Must meet the nuptials that my soul abhors. But this thought now afflicts me, and my mind Continual haunts. Such was not heretofore The suitors custom'd practice; all who chose To engage in competition for a wife Well-qualitied and well-endow'd, produced From their own herds and fatted flocks a feast For the bride's friends, and splendid presents made, But never ate as ye, at others' cost. She ceased; then brave Ulysses toil-inured Rejoiced that, soothing them, she sought to draw From each some gift, although on other views, And more important far, himself intent. Then thus Antinoüs, Eupithes' son. Icarius' daughter wise! only accept Such gifts as we shall bring, for gifts demand That grace, nor can be decently refused; But to our rural labours, or elsewhere Depart not we, till first thy choice be made Of the Achaian, chief in thy esteem. Antinoüs spake, whose answer all approved. Then each dispatch'd his herald who should bring His master's gift. Antinoüs' herald, first, A mantle of surpassing beauty brought, Wide, various, with no fewer clasps adorn'd Than twelve, all golden, and to every clasp Was fitted opposite its eye exact. Next, to Eurymachus his herald bore A necklace of wrought gold, with amber rich Bestudded, every bead bright as a sun. Two servants for Eurydamas produced Ear-pendants fashion'd with laborious art, Broad, triple-gemm'd, of brilliant light profuse. The herald of Polyctor's son, the prince Pisander, brought a collar to his Lord, A sumptuous ornament. Each Greecian gave, And each a gift dissimilar from all. Then, loveliest of her sex, turning away, She sought her chamber, whom her maidens fair Attended, charged with those illustrious gifts. Then turn'd they all to dance and pleasant song Joyous, expecting the approach of even. Ere long the dusky evening came, and them Found sporting still. Then, placing in the hall Three hearths, that should illumine wide the house, They compass'd them around with fuel-wood Long-season'd and new-split, mingling the sticks With torches. The attendant women watch'd And fed those fires by turns, to whom, himself, Their unknown Sovereign thus his speech address'd. Ye maidens of the long-regretted Chief Ulysses! to the inner courts retire, And to your virtuous Queen, that following there Your several tasks, spinning and combing wool, Ye may amuse her; I, meantime, for these Will furnish light, and should they chuse to stay Till golden morn appear, they shall not tire My patience aught, for I can much endure. He said; they tittering on each other gazed. But one, Melantho with the blooming cheeks, Rebuked him rudely. Dolius was her sire, But by Penelope she had been rear'd With care maternal, and in infant years Supplied with many a toy; yet even she Felt not her mistress' sorrows in her heart, But of Eurymachus enamour'd, oft His lewd embraces met; she, with sharp speech Reproachful, to Ulysses thus replied. Why, what a brainsick vagabond art thou! Who neither wilt to the smith's forge retire For sleep, nor to the public portico, But here remaining, with audacious prate Disturb'st this numerous company, restrain'd By no respect or fear; either thou art With wine intoxicated, or perchance, Art always fool, and therefore babblest now. Say, art thou drunk with joy that thou hast foil'd The beggar Irus? Tremble, lest a man Stronger than Irus suddenly arise, Who on thy temples pelting thee with blows Far heavier than his, shall drive thee hence With many a bruise, and foul with thy own blood. To whom Ulysses, frowning stern, replied. Snarler! Telemachus shall be inform'd This moment of thy eloquent harangue, That he may hew thee for it, limb from limb. So saying, he scared the women; back they flew Into the house, but each with faltering knees Through dread, for they believed his threats sincere. He then illumined by the triple blaze, Watch'd close the lights, busy from hearth to hearth, But in his soul, meantime, far other thoughts Revolved, tremendous, not conceived in vain. Nor Pallas (that they might exasperate more Laertes' son) permitted to abstain From heart-corroding bitterness of speech Those suitors proud, of whom Eurymachus, Offspring of Polybus, while thus he jeer'd Ulysses, set the others in a roar. Hear me, ye suitors of the illustrious Queen! I shall promulge my thought. This man, methinks, Not unconducted by the Gods, hath reach'd Ulysses' mansion, for to me the light Of yonder torches altogether seems His own, an emanation from his head, Which not the smallest growth of hair obscures. He ended; and the city-waster Chief Himself accosted next. Art thou disposed To serve me, friend! would I afford thee hire, A labourer at my farm? thou shalt not want Sufficient wages; thou may'st there collect Stones for my fences, and may'st plant my oaks, For which I would supply thee all the year With food, and cloaths, and sandals for thy feet. But thou hast learn'd less creditable arts, Nor hast a will to work, preferring much By beggary from others to extort Wherewith to feed thy never-sated maw. Then answer, thus, Ulysses wise return'd. Forbear, Eurymachus; for were we match'd In work against each other, thou and I, Mowing in spring-time, when the days are long, I with my well-bent sickle in my hand, Thou arm'd with one as keen, for trial sake Of our ability to toil unfed Till night, grass still sufficing for the proof; Or if, again, it were our task to drive Yoked oxen of the noblest breed, sleek-hair'd, Big-limb'd, both batten'd to the full with grass, Their age and aptitude for work the same, Not soon to be fatigued, and were the field In size four acres, with a glebe through which The share might smoothly slide, then should'st thou see How straight my furrow should be cut and true. Or should Saturnian Jove this day excite Here, battle, or elsewhere, and were I arm'd With two bright spears and with a shield, and bore A brazen casque well-fitted to my brows, Me then thou should'st perceive mingling in fight Amid the foremost Chiefs, nor with the crime Of idle beggary should'st upbraid me more. But thou art much a railer, one whose heart Pity moves not, and seem'st a mighty man And valiant to thyself, only because Thou herd'st with few, and those of little worth. But should Ulysses come, at his own isle Again arrived, wide as these portals are, To thee, at once, too narrow they should seem To shoot thee forth with speed enough abroad. He ceased—then tenfold indignation fired Eurymachus; he furrow'd deep his brow With frowns, and in wing'd accents thus replied. Wretch, I shall roughly handle thee anon, Who thus with fluent prate presumptuous darest Disturb this numerous company, restrain'd By no respect or fear. Either thou art With wine intoxicated, or, perchance, Art always fool, and therefore babblest now; Or thou art frantic haply with delight That thou hast foil'd yon vagabond obscure. So saying, he seized a stool; but to the knees Ulysses flew of the Dulichian Prince Amphinomus, and sat, fearing incensed Eurymachus; he on his better hand Smote full the cup-bearer; on the hall-floor Loud rang the fallen beaker, and himself Lay on his back clamouring in the dust. Strait through the dusky hall tumult ensued Among the suitors, of whom thus, a youth, With eyes directed to the next, exclaim'd. Would that this rambling stranger had elsewhere Perish'd, or ever he had here arrived, Then no such uproar had he caused as this! This doth the beggar; he it is for whom We wrangle thus, and may despair of peace Or pleasure more; now look for strife alone. Then in the midst Telemachus upstood Majestic, and the suitors thus bespake. Sirs! ye are mad, and can no longer eat Or drink in peace; some dæmon troubles you. But since ye all have feasted, to your homes Go now, and, at your pleasure, to your beds; Soonest were best, but I thrust no man hence. He ceased; they gnawing stood their lips, aghast With wonder that Telemachus in his speech Such boldness used. Then rose Amphinomus, Brave son of Nisus offspring of the King Aretus, and the assembly thus address'd. My friends! let none with contradiction thwart And rude reply words rational and just; Assault no more the stranger, nor of all The servants of renown'd Ulysses here Harm any. Come. Let the cup-bearer fill To all, that due libation made, to rest We may repair at home, leaving the Prince To accommodate beneath his father's roof The stranger, for he is the Prince's guest. He ended, whose advice none disapproved. The Hero Mulius then, Dulichian-born, And herald of Amphinomus, the cup Filling, dispensed it, as he stood, to all; They, pouring forth to the Immortals, quaff'd The luscious beverage, and when each had made Libation, and such measure as he would Of wine had drunk, then all to rest retired. BOOK XIX. ARGUMENT OF THE NINETEENTH BOOK. Ulysses and Telemachus remove the arms from the hall to an upper-chamber. The Hero then confers with Penelope, to whom he gives a fictitious narrative of his adventures. Euryclea, while bathing Ulysses, discovers him by a scar on his knee, but he prevents her communication of that discovery to Penelope. They went, but left the noble Chief behind In his own house, contriving, by the aid Of Pallas, the destruction of them all, And thus, in accents wing'd, again he said. My son! we must remove and safe dispose All these my well-forged implements of war; And should the suitors, missing them, enquire Where are they? thou shalt answer smoothly thus— I have convey'd them from the reach of smoke, For they appear no more the same which erst Ulysses, going hence to Ilium, left, So smirch'd and sullied by the breath of fire. This weightier reason (thou shalt also say) Some God suggested to me,—lest, inflamed With wine, ye wound each other in your brawls, Shaming both feast and courtship; for the view Itself of arms incites to their abuse. He ceased, and in obedience to his will, Calling the antient Euryclea forth, His nurse, Telemachus enjoin'd her thus. Go—shut the women in; make fast the doors Of their apartment, while I safe dispose Elsewhere my father's implements of war, Which, during his long absence, here have stood Till smoke hath sullied them. For I have been An infant hitherto, but wiser grown, Would now remove them from the breath of fire. Then thus the gentle matron in return. Yes truly,—and I wish that now, at length, Thou would'st assert the privilege of thy years, My son, thyself assuming charge of all, Both house and stores; but who shall bear the light? Since they, it seems, who would, are all forbidden. To whom Telemachus discrete replied. This guest; for no man, from my table fed, Come whence he may, shall be an idler here. He ended, nor his words flew wing'd away, But Euryclea bolted every door. Then, starting to the task, Ulysses caught, And his illustrious son, the weapons thence, Helmet, and bossy shield, and pointed spear, While Pallas from a golden lamp illumed The dusky way before them. At that sight Alarm'd, the Prince his father thus address'd. Whence—whence is this, my father? I behold A prodigy! the walls of the whole house. The arches, fir-tree beams, and pillars tall Shine in my view, as with the blaze of fire! Some Power celestial, doubtless, is within. To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied. Soft! ask no questions. Give no vent to thought. Such is the custom of the Powers divine. Hence, thou, to bed. I stay, that I may yet Both in thy mother and her maidens move More curiosity; yes—she with tears Shall question me of all that I have seen. He ended, and the Prince, at his command, Guided by flaming torches, sought the couch Where he was wont to sleep, and there he slept On that night also, waiting the approach Of sacred dawn. Thus was Ulysses left Alone, and planning sat in solitude, By Pallas' aid, the slaughter of his foes. At length, Diana-like, or like herself All golden Venus, (her apartment left,) Enter'd Penelope. Beside the hearth Her women planted her accustom'd seat With silver wreathed and ivory. That throne Icmalius made, artist renown'd, and join'd A footstool to its splendid frame beneath, Which ever with an ample fleece they spread. There sat discrete Penelope; then came Her beautiful attendants from within, Who clear'd the litter'd bread, the board, and cups From which the insolent companions drank. They also raked the embers from the hearths Now dim, and with fresh billets piled them high, Both for illumination and for warmth. Then yet again Melantho with rude speech Opprobrious, thus, assail'd Ulysses' ear. Guest—wilt thou trouble us throughout the night Ranging the house? and linger'st thou a spy Watching the women? Hence—get thee abroad, Glad of such fare as thou hast found, or soon With torches beaten we will thrust thee forth. To whom Ulysses, frowning stern, replied. Petulant woman! wherefore thus incensed Inveigh'st thou against me? is it because I am not sleek? because my garb is mean? Because I beg? thanks to necessity— I would not else. But such as I appear, Such all who beg and all who wander are. I also lived the happy owner once Of such a stately mansion, and have given To numerous wanderers, whencesoe'er they came, All that they needed; I was also served By many, and enjoy'd all that denotes The envied owner opulent and blest. But Jove (for so it pleased him) hath reduced My all to nothing. Therefore well beware Thou also, mistress! lest a day arrive When all these charms by which thou shinest among Thy sister-menials, fade; fear, too, lest her Thou should'st perchance irritate, whom thou servest, And lest Ulysses come, of whose return Hope yet survives; but even though the Chief Have perish'd, as ye think, and comes no more, Consider yet his son, how bright the gifts Shine of Apollo in the illustrious Prince Telemachus; no woman, unobserved By him, can now commit a trespass here; His days of heedless infancy are past. He ended, whom Penelope discrete O'erhearing, her attendant sharp rebuked. Shameless, audacious woman! known to me Is thy great wickedness, which with thy life Thou shalt atone; for thou wast well aware, (Hearing it from myself,) that I design'd To ask this stranger of my absent Lord, For whose dear sake I never cease to mourn. Then to her household's governess she said; Bring now a seat, and spread it with a fleece, Eurynome! that, undisturb'd, the guest May hear and answer all that I shall ask. She ended. Then the matron brought in haste A polish'd seat, and spread it with a fleece, On which the toil-accustom'd Hero sat, And thus the chaste Penelope began. Stranger! my first enquiry shall be this— Who art thou? whence? where born, and sprung from whom? Then answer thus Ulysses, wise, return'd. O Queen! uncensurable by the lips Of mortal man! thy glory climbs the skies Unrivall'd, like the praise of some great King Who o'er a numerous people and renown'd Presiding like a Deity, maintains Justice and truth. The earth, under his sway, Her produce yields abundantly; the trees Fruit-laden bend; the lusty flocks bring forth; The Ocean teems with finny swarms beneath His just controul, and all the land is blest. Me therefore question of what else thou wilt In thy own palace, but forbear to ask From whom I sprang, and of my native land, Lest thou, reminding me of those sad themes, Augment my woes; for I have much endured; Nor were it seemly, in another's house, To pass the hours in sorrow and in tears, Wearisome when indulged with no regard To time or place; thy train (perchance thyself) Would blame me, and I should reproach incur As one tear-deluged through excess of wine. Him answer'd then Penelope discrete. The immortal Gods, O stranger, then destroy'd My form, my grace, my beauty, when the Greeks Whom my Ulysses follow'd, sail'd to Troy. Could he, returning, my domestic charge Himself intend, far better would my fame Be so secured, and wider far diffused. But I am wretched now, such storms of woe The Gods have sent me; for as many Chiefs As hold dominion in the neighbour isles Samos, Dulichium, and the forest-crown'd Zacynthus; others, also, rulers here In pleasant Ithaca, me, loth to wed, Woo ceaseless, and my household stores consume. I, therefore, neither guest nor suppliant heed, Nor public herald more, but with regret Of my Ulysses wear my soul away. They, meantime, press my nuptials, which by art I still procrastinate. Some God the thought Suggested to me, to commence a robe Of amplest measure and of subtlest woof, Laborious task; which done, I thus address'd them. Princes, my suitors! since the noble Chief Ulysses is no more, enforce not now My nuptials; wait till I shall finish first A funeral robe, (lest all my threads be marr'd,) Which for the ancient Hero I prepare Laertes, looking for the mournful hour When fate shall snatch him to eternal rest. Else, I the censure dread of all my sex, Should he, so wealthy, want at last a shroud. Such was my speech; they, unsuspicious all, With my request complied. Thenceforth, all day I wove the ample web, and, by the aid Of torches, ravell'd it again at night. Three years by artifice I thus their suit Eluded safe; but when the fourth arrived, And the same season after many moons And fleeting days return'd, passing my train Who had neglected to release the dogs, They came, surprised, and reprimanded me. Thus, through necessity, not choice, at last I have perform'd it, in my own despight. But no escape from marriage now remains, Nor other subterfuge for me; meantime My parents urge my nuptials, and my son (Of age to note it) with disgust observes His wealth consumed; for he is now become Adult, and abler than myself to rule The house, a Prince distinguish'd by the Gods. Yet, stranger, after all, speak thy descent; Say whence thou art; for not of fabulous birth Art thou, nor from the oak, nor from the rock. Her answer'd then Ulysses, ever-wise. O spouse revered of Laertiades! Resolvest thou still to learn from whom I sprang? Learn then; but know that thou shalt much augment My present grief, natural to a man Who hath, like me, long exiled from his home Through various cities of the sons of men Wander'd remote, and numerous woes endured. Yet, though it pain me, I will tell thee all. There is a land amid the sable flood Call'd Crete; fair, fruitful, circled by the sea. Numerous are her inhabitants, a race Not to be summ'd, and ninety towns she boasts. Diverse their language is; Achaians some, And some indigenous are; Cydonians there, Crest-shaking Dorians, and Pelasgians dwell. One city in extent the rest exceeds, Cnossus; the city in which Minos reign'd, Who, ever at a nine-years-close, conferr'd With Jove himself; from him my father sprang, The brave Deucalion; for Deucalion's sons Were two, myself and King Idomeneus. To Ilium he, on board his gallant barks Follow'd the Atridæ. I, the youngest-born, By my illustrious name, Æthon, am known, But he ranks foremost both in worth and years. There I beheld Ulysses, and within My walls received him; for a violent wind Had driven him from Malea (while he sought The shores of Troy) to Crete. The storm his barks Bore into the Amnisus, for the cave Of Ilythia known, a dangerous port, And which with difficulty he attain'd. He, landing, instant to the city went, Seeking Idomeneus; his friend of old, As he affirm'd, and one whom much he loved. But he was far remote, ten days advanced, Perhaps eleven, on his course to Troy. Him therefore I conducted to my home, Where hospitably, and with kindest care I entertain'd him, (for I wanted nought) And for himself procured and for his band, By public contribution, corn, and wine, And beeves for food, that all might be sufficed. Twelve days his noble Greecians there abode, Port-lock'd by Boreas blowing with a force Resistless even on the land, some God So roused his fury; but the thirteenth day The wind all fell, and they embark'd again. With many a fiction specious, as he sat, He thus her ear amused; she at the sound Melting, with fluent tears her cheeks bedew'd; And as the snow by Zephyrus diffused, Melts on the mountain tops, when Eurus breathes, And fills the channels of the running streams, So melted she, and down her lovely cheeks Pour'd fast the tears, him mourning as remote Who sat beside her. Soft compassion touch'd Ulysses of his consort's silent woe; His eyes, as they had been of steel or horn, Moved not, yet artful, he suppress'd his tears, And she, at length, with overflowing grief Satiate, replied, and thus enquired again. Now, stranger, I shall prove thee, as I judge, If thou, indeed, hast entertain'd in Crete My spouse and his brave followers, as thou say'st. Describe his raiment and himself; his own Appearance, and the appearance of his friends. Then her Ulysses answer'd, ever-wise. Hard is the task, O Queen! (so long a time Hath since elapsed,) to tell thee. Twenty years Have pass'd since he forsook my native isle, Yet, from my best remembrance, I will give A likeness of him, such as now I may. A double cloak, thick-piled, Mæonian-dyed, The noble Chief had on; two fastenings held The golden clasp, and it display'd in front A well-wrought pattern with much art design'd. An hound between his fore-feet holding fast A dappled fawn, gaped eager on his prey. All wonder'd, seeing how in lifeless gold Express'd, the dog with open mouth her throat Attempted still, and how the fawn with hoofs Thrust trembling forward, struggled to escape. That glorious mantle much I noticed, soft To touch, as the dried garlick's glossy film; Such was the smoothness of it, and it shone Sun-bright; full many a maiden, trust me, view'd The splendid texture with admiring eyes. But mark me now; deep treasure in thy mind This word. I know not if Ulysses wore That cloak at home, or whether of his train Some warrior gave it to him on his way, Or else some host of his; for many loved Ulysses, and with him might few compare. I gave to him, myself, a brazen sword, A purple cloak magnificent, and vest Of royal length, and, when he sought his bark, With princely pomp dismiss'd him from the shore. An herald also waited on the Chief, Somewhat his senior; him I next describe. His back was bunch'd, his visage swarthy, curl'd His poll, and he was named Eurybates; A man whom most of all his followers far Ulysses honour'd, for their minds were one. He ceased; she, recognizing all the proofs Distinctly by Ulysses named, was moved Still more to weep, till with o'erflowing grief Satiate, at length she answer'd him again. Henceforth, O stranger, thou who hadst before My pity, shalt my reverence share and love. I folded for him with these hands the cloak Which thou describest, produced it when he went, And gave it to him; I that splendid clasp Attach'd to it myself, more to adorn My honour'd Lord, whom to his native land Return'd secure I shall receive no more. In such an evil hour Ulysses went To that bad city never to be named. To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied. Consort revered of Laertiades! No longer let anxiety impair Thy beauteous form, nor any grief consume Thy spirits more for thy Ulysses' sake. And yet I blame thee not; a wife deprived Of her first mate to whom she had produced Fair fruit of mutual love, would mourn his loss, Although he were inferior far to thine, Whom fame affirms the semblance of the Gods. But cease to mourn. Hear me. I will relate A faithful tale, nor will from thee withhold Such tidings of Ulysses living still, And of his safe return, as I have heard Lately, in yon neighbouring opulent land Of the Thesprotians. He returns enrich'd With many precious stores from those obtain'd Whom he hath visited; but he hath lost, Departing from Thrinacia's isle, his bark And all his loved companions in the Deep, For Jove was adverse to him, and the Sun, Whose beeves his followers slew. They perish'd all Amid the billowy flood; but Him, the keel Bestriding of his bark, the waves at length Cast forth on the Phæacian's land, a race Allied to heaven, who reverenced like a God Thy husband, honour'd him with numerous gifts, And willing were to have convey'd him home. Ulysses, therefore, had attain'd long since His native shore, but that he deem'd it best To travel far, that he might still amass More wealth; so much Ulysses all mankind Excels in policy, and hath no peer. This information from Thesprotia's King I gain'd, from Phidon; to myself he swore Libation offering under his own roof, That both the bark was launch'd, and the stout crew Prepared, that should conduct him to his home. But me he first dismiss'd; for, as it chanced, A ship lay there of the Thesprotians, bound To corn-enrich'd Dulichium. All the wealth He shew'd me by the Chief amass'd, a store To feed the house of yet another Prince To the tenth generation; so immense His treasures were within that palace lodged. Himself he said was to Dodona gone, Counsel to ask from the oracular oaks Sublime of Jove, how safest he might seek, After long exile thence, his native land, If openly were best, or in disguise. Thus, therefore, he is safe, and at his home Well-nigh arrived, nor shall his country long Want him. I swear it with a solemn oath. First Jove be witness, King and Lord of all! Next these domestic Gods of the renown'd Ulysses, in whose royal house I sit, That thou shalt see my saying all fulfill'd. Ulysses shall this self-same year return, This self-same month, ere yet the next begin. Him answer'd then Penelope discrete. Grant heaven, my guest, that this good word of thine Fail not! then, soon shalt thou such bounty share And friendship at my hands, that, at first sight, Whoe'er shall meet thee shall pronounce thee blest. But ah! my soul forebodes how it will prove; Neither Ulysses will return, nor thou Receive safe conduct hence; for we have here None, such as once Ulysses was, to rule His household with authority, and to send With honourable convoy to his home The worthy guest, or to regale him here. Give him the bath, my maidens; spread his couch With linen soft, with fleecy gaberdines A gaberdine is a shaggy cloak of coarse but warm materials. Such always make part of Homer's bed-furniture. And rugs of splendid hue, that he may lie Waiting, well-warm'd, the golden morn's return. Attend him also at the peep of day With bath and unction, that, his seat resumed Here in the palace, he may be prepared For breakfast with Telemachus; and woe To him who shall presume to incommode Or cause him pain; that man shall be cashier'd Hence instant, burn his anger as it may. For how, my honour'd inmate! shalt thou learn That I in wisdom œconomic aught Pass other women, if unbathed, unoil'd, Ill-clad, thou sojourn here? man's life is short. Whoso is cruel, and to cruel arts Addict, on him all men, while yet he lives, Call plagues and curses down, and after death Scorn and proverbial mockeries hunt his name. But men, humane themselves, and given by choice To offices humane, from land to land Are rumour'd honourably by their guests, And every tongue is busy in their praise. Her answer'd then Ulysses ever-wise. Consort revered of Laertiades! Warm gaberdines and rugs of splendid hue To me have odious been, since first the sight Of Crete's snow-mantled mountain-tops, I lost, Sweeping the billows with extended oars. No; I will pass, as I am wont to pass The sleepless night; for on a sordid couch Outstretch'd, full many a night have I reposed Till golden-charioted Aurora dawn'd. Nor me the foot-bath pleases more; my foot Shall none of all thy ministring maidens touch, Unless there be some antient matron grave Among them, who hath pangs of heart endured Numerous, and keen as I have felt myself; Her I refuse not. She may touch my feet. Him answer'd then prudent Penelope. Dear guest! for of all travellers here arrived From distant regions, I have none received Discrete as thou, or whom I more have loved, So just thy matter is, and with such grace Express'd,—I have an ancient maiden grave, The nurse who at my hapless husband's birth Received him in her arms, and with kind care Maternal rear'd him; she shall wash thy feet, Although decrepid. Euryclea, rise! Wash one coeval with thy Lord; for such The feet and hands, it may be, are become Of my Ulysses now; since man beset With sorrow once, soon wrinkled grows and old. She said, then Euryclea with both hands Covering her face, in tepid tears profuse Dissolved, and thus in mournful strains began. Alas! my son, trouble for thy dear sake Distracts me. Jove surely of all mankind Thee hated most, though ever in thy heart Devoutly given; for never mortal man So many thighs of fatted victims burn'd, And chosen hecatombs produced as thou To Jove the Thunderer, him entreating still That he would grant thee a serene old age, And to instruct, thyself, thy glorious son. Yet thus the God requites thee, cutting off All hope of thy return:—oh ancient sir! Him too, perchance, where'er he sits a guest Beneath some foreign roof, the women taunt, As all these shameless ones have taunted thee, Fearing whose mockery thou forbidd'st their hands This office, which Icarius' daughter wise To me enjoins, and which I, glad, perform. Yes, I will wash thy feet; both for her sake And for thy own,—for sight of thee hath raised A tempest in my mind. Hear now the cause! Full many a guest forlorn we entertain, But never any have I seen, whose size, The fashion of whose foot, and pitch of voice, Such likeness of Ulysses show'd, as thine. To whom Ulysses, ever shrewd, replied. Such close similitude, O antient dame! As thou observest between thy Lord and me, All who have seen us both, have ever found. He said; then taking the resplendent vase Allotted always to that use, she first Infused cold water largely, then the warm. Ulysses (for beside the hearth he sat) Turn'd quick his face into the shade, alarm'd Lest, handling him, she should at once remark His scar, and all his stratagem unveil. She then, approaching, minister'd the bath To her own King, and at first touch discern'd That token, by a bright-tusk'd boar of old Impress'd, what time he to Parnassus went To visit there Autolycus and his sons, His mother's noble sire, who all mankind In furtive Homer's morals seem to allow to a good man dissimulation, and even an ambiguous oath, should they be necessary to save him from a villain. Thus in Book XX. Telemachus swears by Zeus, that he does not hinder his mother from marrying whom she pleases of the wooers, though at the same time he is plotting their destruction with his father. F. arts and fraudful oaths excell'd. For such endowments he by gifts received From Hermes' self, to whom the thighs of kids He offer'd and of lambs, and, in return, The watchful Hermes never left his side. Autolycus, arriving in the isle Of pleasant Ithaca, the new-born son Of his own daughter found, whom on his knees At close of supper Euryclea placed, And thus the royal visitant address'd. Thyself, Autolycus! devise a name For thy own daughter's son, by numerous prayers Of thine and fervent, from the Gods obtained. Then answer thus Autolycus return'd. My daughter and my daughter's spouse! the name Which I shall give your boy, that let him bear. Since after provocation and offence To numbers given of either sex, I come, Call him, Ulysses In the Greek ????????? from the verb ??????—Irascor, I am angry.; and when, grown mature, He shall Parnassus visit, the abode Magnificent in which his mother dwelt, And where my treasures lie, from my own stores I will enrich and send him joyful home. Ulysses, therefore, that he might obtain Those princely gifts, went thither. Him arrived, With right-hand gratulation and with words Of welcome kind, Autolycus received, Nor less his offspring; but the mother most Of his own mother clung around his neck, Amphithea; she with many a fervent kiss His forehead press'd, and his bright-beaming eyes. Then bade Autolycus his noble sons Set forth a banquet. They, at his command, Led in a fatted ox of the fifth year, Which slaying first, they spread him carved abroad, Then scored his flesh, transfix'd it with the spits, And roasting all with culinary skill Exact, gave each a portion. Thus they sat Feasting all day, and till the sun declined; But when the sun declined, and darkness fell, Each sought his couch, and took the gift of sleep. Then, soon as day-spring's daughter rosy-palm'd Aurora look'd abroad, forth went the hounds, And with the hounds Ulysses, and the youths, Sons of Autolycus, to chase the boar. Arrived at the Parnassian mount, they climb'd His bushy sides, and to his airy heights Ere long attain'd. It was the pleasant hour When from the gently-swelling flood profound The sun, emerging, first smote on the fields. The hunters reach'd the valley; foremost ran, Questing, the hounds; behind them, swift, the sons Came of Autolycus, with whom advanced The illustrious Prince Ulysses, pressing close The hounds, and brandishing his massy spear. There, hid in thickest shades, lay an huge boar. That covert neither rough winds blowing moist Could penetrate, nor could the noon-day sun Smite through it, or fast falling showers pervade, So thick it was, and underneath, the ground With litter of dry foliage strew'd profuse. Hunters and dogs approaching him, his ear The sound of feet perceived; upridging high His bristly back and glaring fire, he sprang Forth from the shrubs, and in defiance stood Near and right opposite. Ulysses, first, Rush'd on him, elevating his long spear Ardent to wound him; but, preventing quick His foe, the boar gash'd him above the knee. Much flesh, assailing him oblique, he tore With his rude tusk, but to the Hero's bone Pierced not; Ulysses his right shoulder reach'd; And with a deadly thrust impell'd the point Of his bright spear through him and far beyond. Loud yell'd the boar, sank in the dust, and died. Around Ulysses, then, the busy sons Throng'd of Autolycus; expert they braced The wound of the illustrious hunter bold, With incantation stanch'd the sable blood, And sought in haste their father's house again, Whence, heal'd and gratified with splendid gifts They sent him soon rejoicing to his home, Themselves rejoicing also. Glad their son His parents saw again, and of the scar Enquired, where given, and how? He told them all, How to Parnassus with his friends he went, Sons of Autolycus to hunt, and how A boar had gash'd him with his ivory tusk. That scar, while chafing him with open palms, The matron knew; she left his foot to fall; Down dropp'd his leg into the vase; the brass Rang, and, o'ertilted by the sudden shock, Pour'd forth the water, flooding wide the floor. Her spirit joy at once and sorrow seized; Tears fill'd her eyes; her intercepted voice Died in her throat; but to Ulysses' beard Her hand advancing, thus, at length she spake. Thou art himself, Ulysses. Oh my son! Dear to me, and my master as thou art, I knew thee not, till I had touch'd the scar. She said, and to Penelope her eyes Directed, all impatient to declare Her own Ulysses even then at home. But she, nor eye nor ear for aught that pass'd Had then, her fixt attention so entire Minerva had engaged. Then, darting forth His arms, the Hero with his right-hand close Compress'd her throat, and nearer to himself Drawing her with his left, thus caution'd her. Why would'st thou ruin me? Thou gavest me milk Thyself from thy own breast. See me return'd After long sufferings, in the twentieth year, To my own land. But since (some God the thought Suggesting to thee) thou hast learn'd the truth, Silence! lest others learn it from thy lips. For this I say, nor shall the threat be vain; If God vouchsafe to me to overcome The haughty suitors, when I shall inflict Death on the other women of my house, Although my nurse, thyself shalt also die. Him answer'd Euryclea then, discrete. My son! oh how could so severe a word Escape thy lips? my fortitude of mind Thou know'st, and even now shalt prove me firm As iron, secret as the stubborn rock. But hear and mark me well. Should'st thou prevail, Assisted by a Power divine, to slay The haughty suitors, I will then, myself, Give thee to know of all the female train Who have dishonour'd thee, and who respect. To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied. My nurse, it were superfluous; spare thy tongue That needless task. I can distinguish well Myself, between them, and shall know them all; But hold thy peace. Hush! leave it with the Gods. So he; then went the antient matron forth, That she might serve him with a second bath, For the whole first was spilt. Thus, laved at length, And smooth'd with oil, Ulysses nearer pull'd His seat toward the glowing hearth to enjoy More warmth, and drew his tatters o'er the scar. Then, prudent, thus Penelope began. One question, stranger, I shall yet propound, Though brief, for soon the hour of soft repose Grateful to all, and even to the sad Whom gentle sleep forsakes not, will arrive. But heaven to me immeasurable woe Assigns,—whose sole delight is to consume My days in sighs, while here retired I sit, Watching my maidens' labours and my own; But (night return'd, and all to bed retired) I press mine also, yet with deep regret And anguish lacerated, even there. As when at spring's first entrance, her sweet song The azure-crested nightingale renews, Daughter of Pandarus; within the grove's Thick foliage perch'd, she pours her echoing voice Now deep, now clear, still varying the strain With which she mourns her Itylus, her son By royal Zethus, whom she, erring She intended to slay the son of her husband's brother Amphion, incited to it by envy of his wife, who had six children, while herself had only two, but through mistake she slew her own son Itylus, and for her punishment was transformed by Jupiter into a nightingale., slew, So also I, by soul distressing doubts Toss'd ever, muse if I shall here remain A faithful guardian of my son's affairs, My husband's bed respecting, and not less My own fair fame, or whether I shall him Of all my suitors follow to his home Who noblest seems, and offers richest dower. My son while he was infant yet, and own'd An infant's mind, could never give consent That I should wed and leave him; but, at length, Since he hath reach'd the stature of a man, He wishes my departure hence, the waste Viewing indignant by the suitors made. But I have dream'd. Hear, and expound my dream. My geese are twenty, which within my walls I feed with sodden wheat; they serve to amuse Sometimes my sorrow. From the mountains came An eagle, huge, hook-beak'd, brake all their necks, And slew them; scatter'd on the palace-floor They lay, and he soar'd swift into the skies. Dream only as it was, I wept aloud, Till all my maidens, gather'd by my voice, Arriving, found me weeping still, and still Complaining, that the eagle had at once Slain all my geese. But, to the palace-roof Stooping again, he sat, and with a voice Of human sound, forbad my tears, and said— Courage! O daughter of the far-renown'd Icarius! no vain dream thou hast beheld, But, in thy sleep, a truth. The slaughter'd geese Denote thy suitors. I who have appear'd An eagle in thy sight, am yet indeed Thy husband, who have now, at last, return'd, Death, horrid death designing for them all. He said; then waking at the voice, I cast An anxious look around, and saw my geese Beside their tray, all feeding as before. Her then Ulysses answer'd, ever-wise. O Queen! it is not possible to miss Thy dream's plain import, since Ulysses' self Hath told thee the event; thy suitors all Must perish; not one suitor shall escape. To whom Penelope discrete replied. Dreams are inexplicable, O my guest! And oft-times mere delusions that receive No just accomplishment. There are two gates The difference of the two substances may perhaps serve to account for the preference given in this case to the gate of horn; horn being transparent, and as such emblematical of truth; while ivory, from its whiteness, promises light, but is, in fact, opaque. F. Through which the fleeting phantoms pass; of horn Is one, and one of ivory. Such dreams As through the thin-leaf'd ivory portal come Soothe, but perform not, uttering empty sounds; But such as through the polish'd horn escape, If haply seen by any mortal eye, Prove faithful witnesses, and are fulfill'd. But through those gates my wondrous dream, I think, Came not; thrice welcome were it else to me And to my son. Now mark my words; attend. This is the hated morn that from the house Removes me of Ulysses. I shall fix, This day, the rings for trial to them all Of archership; Ulysses' custom was To plant twelve spikes The translation here is somewhat pleonastic for the sake of perspicuity; the original is clear in itself, but not to us who have no such practice. Twelve stakes were fixed in the earth, each having a ring at the top; the order in which they stood was so exact, that an arrow sent with an even hand through the first ring, would pass them all., all regular arranged Like galley-props, and crested with a ring, Then standing far remote, true in his aim He with his whizzing shaft would thrid them all. This is the contest in which now I mean To prove the suitors; him, who with most ease Shall bend the bow, and shoot through all the rings, I follow, this dear mansion of my youth Leaving, so fair, so fill'd with every good, Though still to love it even in my dreams. Her answer'd then Ulysses, ever-wise. Consort revered of Laertiades! Postpone not this contention, but appoint Forthwith the trial; for Ulysses here Will sure arrive, ere they (his polish'd bow Long tampering) shall prevail to stretch the nerve, And speed the arrow through the iron rings. To whom Penelope replied discrete. Would'st thou with thy sweet converse, O my guest! Here soothe me still, sleep ne'er should influence These eyes the while; but always to resist Sleep's power is not for man, to whom the Gods Each circumstance of his condition here Fix universally. Myself will seek My own apartment at the palace-top, And there will lay me down on my sad couch, For such it hath been, and with tears of mine Ceaseless bedew'd, e'er since Ulysses went To that bad city, never to be named. There will I sleep; but sleep thou here below, Either, thyself, preparing on the ground Thy couch, or on a couch by these prepared. So saying, she to her splendid chamber thence Retired, not sole, but by her female train Attended; there arrived, she wept her spouse, Her loved Ulysses, till Minerva dropp'd The balm of slumber on her weary lids. BOOK XX. ARGUMENT OF THE TWENTIETH BOOK. Ulysses, doubting whether he shall destroy or not the women servants who commit lewdness with the suitors, resolves at length to spare them for the present. He asks an omen from Jupiter, and that he would grant him also to hear some propitious words from the lips of one in the family. His petitions are both answered. Preparation is made for the feast. Whilst the suitors sit at table, Pallas smites them with a horrid frenzy. Theoclymenus, observing the strange effects of it, prophecies their destruction, and they deride his prophecy. But in the vestibule the Hero lay On a bull's hide undress'd, o'er which he spread The fleece of many a sheep slain by the Greeks, And, cover'd by the household's governess With a wide cloak, composed himself to rest. Yet slept he not, but meditating lay Woe to his enemies. Meantime the train Of women wonted to the suitors' arms, Issuing all mirth and laughter, in his soul A tempest raised of doubts, whether at once To slay, or to permit them yet to give Their lusty paramours one last embrace. As growls the mastiff standing on the start For battle, if a stranger's foot approach Her cubs new-whelp'd—so growl'd Ulysses' heart, While wonder fill'd him at their impious deeds. But, smiting on his breast, thus he reproved The mutinous inhabitant within. Heart! bear it. Worse than this thou didst endure When, uncontroulable by force of man, The Cyclops thy illustrious friends devour'd. Thy patience then fail'd not, till prudence found Deliverance for thee on the brink of fate. So disciplined the Hero his own heart, Which, tractable, endured the rigorous curb, And patient; yet he turn'd from side to side. As when some hungry swain turns oft a maw Unctuous and savoury on the burning coals, Quick expediting his desired repast, So he from side to side roll'd, pondering deep How likeliest with success he might assail Those shameless suitors; one to many opposed. Then, sudden from the skies descending, came Minerva in a female form; her stand Above his head she took, and thus she spake. Why sleep'st thou not, unhappiest of mankind? Thou art at home; here dwells thy wife, and here Thy son; a son, whom all might wish their own. Then her Ulysses answer'd, ever-wise. O Goddess! true is all that thou hast said, But, not without anxiety, I muse How, single as I am, I shall assail Those shameless suitors who frequent my courts Daily, and always their whole multitude. This weightier theme I meditate beside; Should I, with Jove's concurrence and with thine Prevail to slay them, how shall I escape, Myself That is, how shall I escape the vengeance of their kindred?, at last? oh Goddess, weigh it well. Him answer'd then Pallas cœrulean-eyed. Oh faithless man! a man will in his friend Confide, though mortal, and in valour less And wisdom than himself; but I who keep Thee in all difficulties, am divine. I tell thee plainly. Were we hemm'd around By fifty troops of shouting warriors bent To slay thee, thou should'st yet securely drive The flocks away and cattle of them all. But yield to sleep's soft influence; for to lie All night thus watchful, is, itself, distress. Fear not. Deliverance waits, not far remote. So saying, she o'er Ulysses' eyes diffused Soft slumbers, and when sleep that soothes the mind And nerves the limbs afresh had seized him once, To the Olympian summit swift return'd. But his chaste spouse awoke; she weeping sat On her soft couch, and noblest of her sex, Satiate at length with tears, her prayer address'd First to Diana of the Powers above. Diana, aweful progeny of Jove! I would that with a shaft this moment sped Into my bosom, thou would'st here conclude My mournful life! or, oh that, as it flies, Snatching me through the pathless air, a storm Would whelm me deep in Ocean's restless tide! So, when the Gods their parents had destroy'd, Storms suddenly the beauteous daughters Aëdon, Cleothera, Merope. snatch'd Of Pandarus away; them left forlorn Venus with curds, with honey and with wine Fed duly; Juno gave them to surpass All women in the charms of face and mind, With graceful stature eminent the chaste Diana bless'd them, and in works of art Illustrious, Pallas taught them to excell. But when the foam-sprung Goddess to the skies A suitress went on their behalf, to obtain Blest nuptials for them from the Thunderer Jove, (For Jove the happiness, himself, appoints, And the unhappiness of all below,) Meantime, the Harpies ravishing away Those virgins, gave them to the Furies three, That they might serve them. O that me the Gods Inhabiting Olympus so would hide From human eyes for ever, or bright-hair'd Diana pierce me with a shaft, that while Ulysses yet engages all my thoughts, My days concluded, I might 'scape the pain Of gratifying some inferior Chief! This is supportable, when (all the day To sorrow given) the mourner sleeps at night; For sleep, when it hath once the eyelids veil'd, All reminiscence blots of all alike, Both good and ill; but me the Gods afflict Not seldom even in dreams, and at my side, This night again, one lay resembling him; Such as my own Ulysses when he join'd Achaia's warriors; my exulting heart No airy dream believed it, but a truth. While thus she spake, in orient gold enthroned Came forth the morn; Ulysses, as she wept, Heard plain her lamentation; him that sound Alarm'd; he thought her present, and himself Known to her. Gathering hastily the cloak His covering, and the fleeces, them he placed Together on a throne within the hall, But bore the bull's-hide forth into the air. Then, lifting high his hands to Jove, he pray'd. Eternal Sire! if over moist and dry Ye have with good will sped me to my home After much suffering, grant me from the lips Of some domestic now awake, to hear Words of propitious omen, and thyself Vouchsafe me still some other sign abroad. Such prayer he made, and Jove omniscient heard. Sudden he thunder'd from the radiant heights Olympian; glad, Ulysses heard the sound. A woman, next, a labourer at the mill Hard by, where all the palace-mills were wrought, Gave him the omen of propitious sound. Twelve maidens, day by day, toil'd at the mills, Meal grinding, some of barley, some of wheat, Marrow ?????? ??????. of man. The rest (their portion ground) All slept; she only from her task as yet Ceased not, for she was feeblest of them all; She rested on her mill, and thus pronounced The happy omen by her Lord desired. Jove, Father, Governor of heaven and earth! Loud thou hast thunder'd from the starry skies By no cloud veil'd; a sign propitious, given To whom I know not; but oh grant the prayer Of a poor bond-woman! appoint their feast This day, the last that in Ulysses' house The suitors shall enjoy, for whom I drudge, With aching heart and trembling knees their meal Grinding continual. Feast they here no more! She ended, and the listening Chief received With equal joy both signs; for well he hoped That he should punish soon those guilty men. And now the other maidens in the hall Assembling, kindled on the hearth again The unwearied blaze; then, godlike from his couch Arose Telemachus, and fresh-attired, Athwart his shoulders his bright faulchion slung, Bound his fair sandals to his feet, and took His sturdy spear pointed with glittering brass; Advancing to the portal, there he stood, And Euryclea thus, his nurse, bespake. Nurse! have ye with respectful notice served Our guest? or hath he found a sordid couch Even where he might? for, prudent though she be, My mother, inattentive oft, the worse Treats kindly, and the better sends away. Whom Euryclea answer'd thus discrete. Blame not, my son! who merits not thy blame. The guest sat drinking till he would no more, And ate, till, question'd, he replied—Enough. But when the hour of sleep call'd him to rest, She gave commandment to her female train To spread his couch. Yet he, like one forlorn, And through despair, indifferent to himself, Both bed and rugs refused, and in the porch On skins of sheep and on an undress'd hide Reposed, where we threw covering over him. She ceased, and grasping his bright-headed spear, Forth went the Prince attended, as he went, By his fleet hounds; to the assembled Greeks In council with majestic gait he moved, And Euryclea, daughter wise of Ops, Pisenor's son, call'd to the serving-maids. Haste ye! be diligent! sweep the palace-floor And sprinkle it; then give the sumptuous seats Their purple coverings. Let others cleanse With sponges all the tables, wash and rince The beakers well, and goblets rich-emboss'd; Run others to the fountain, and bring thence Water with speed. The suitors will not long Be absent, but will early come to-day, For this day is a public festival The new moon.. So she; whom all, obedient, heard; forth went Together, twenty to the chrystal fount, While in their several provinces the rest Bestirr'd them brisk at home. Then enter'd all The suitors, and began cleaving the wood. Meantime, the women from the fountain came, Whom soon the swine-herd follow'd, driving three His fattest brawns; them in the spacious court He feeding left, and to Ulysses' side Approaching, courteously bespake the Chief. Guest! look the Greecians on thee with respect At length, or still disdainful as before? Then, answer thus Ulysses wise return'd. Yes—and I would that vengeance from the Gods Might pay their insolence, who in a house Not theirs, dominion exercise, and plan Unseemly projects, shameless as they are! Thus they conferr'd; and now Melanthius came The goat-herd, driving, with the aid of two His fellow-swains, the fattest of his goats To feast the suitors. In the sounding porch The goats he tied, then, drawing near, in terms Reproachful thus assail'd Ulysses' ear. How, stranger! perseverest thou, begging, still To vex the suitors? wilt thou not depart? Scarce shall we settle this dispute, I judge, Till we have tasted each the other's fist; Thou art unreasonable thus to beg Here always;—have the Greeks no feasts beside? He spake, to whom Ulysses answer none Return'd, but shook his brows, and silent framed Terrible purposes. Then, third, approach'd Chief o'er the herds, Philœtius; fatted goats He for the suitors brought, with which he drove An heifer; (ferry-men had pass'd them o'er, Carriers of all who on their coast arrive;) He tied them in the sounding porch, then stood Beside the swine-herd, to whom thus he said. Who is this guest, Eumæus, here arrived So lately? from what nation hath he come? What parentage and country boasts the man? I pity him, whose figure seems to speak Royalty in him. Heaven will surely plunge The race of common wanderers deep in woe, If thus it destine even Kings to mourn. He ceased; and, with his right hand, drawing nigh, Welcomed Ulysses, whom he thus bespake. Hail venerable guest! and be thy lot Prosperous at least hereafter, who art held At present, in the bonds of numerous ills. Thou, Jupiter, of all the Gods, art most Severe, and sparest not to inflict distress Even on creatures from thyself derived He is often called—????? ?????? ?? ???? ??.. I had no sooner mark'd thee, than my eyes Swam, and the sweat gush'd from me at the thought Of dear Ulysses; for if yet he live And see the sun, such tatters, I suppose, He wears, a wanderer among human-kind. But if already with the dead he dwell In Pluto's drear abode, oh then, alas For kind Ulysses! who consign'd to me, While yet a boy, his Cephalenian herds, And they have now encreased to such a store Innumerable of broad-fronted beeves, As only care like mine could have produced. These, by command of others, I transport For their regale, who neither heed his son, Nor tremble at the anger of the Gods, But long have wish'd ardently to divide And share the substance of our absent Lord. Me therefore this thought occupies, and haunts My mind not seldom; while the heir survives It were no small offence to drive his herds Afar, and migrate to a foreign land; Yet here to dwell, suffering oppressive wrongs While I attend another's beeves, appears Still less supportable; and I had fled, And I had served some other mighty Chief Long since, (for patience fails me to endure My present lot,) but that I cherish still Some hope of my ill-fated Lord's return, To rid his palace of these lawless guests. To whom Ulysses, ever-wise, replied. Herdsman! since neither void of sense thou seem'st, Nor yet dishonest, but myself am sure That thou art owner of a mind discrete, Hear therefore, for I swear! bold I attest Jove and this hospitable board, and these The Lares Household Gods who presided over the hearth. of the noble Chief, whose hearth Protects me now, that ere thy going hence, Ulysses surely shall have reach'd his home, And thou shalt see him, if thou wilt, thyself, Slaying the suitors who now lord it here. Him answer'd then the keeper of his beeves. Oh stranger! would but the Saturnian King Perform that word, thou should'st be taught (thyself Eye-witness of it) what an arm is mine. Eumæus also every power of heaven Entreated, that Ulysses might possess His home again. Thus mutual they conferr'd. Meantime, in conference close the suitors plann'd Death for Telemachus; but while they sat Consulting, on their left the bird of Jove An eagle soar'd, grasping a timorous dove. Then thus Amphinomus the rest bespake. Oh friends! our consultation how to slay Telemachus, will never smoothly run To its effect; but let us to the feast. So spake Amphinomus, whose counsel pleased. Then, all into the royal house repair'd, And on the thrones and couches throwing off Their mantles, slew the fatted goats, the brawns, The sheep full-sized, and heifer of the herd. The roasted entrails first they shared, then fill'd The beakers, and the swine-herd placed the cups; Philœtius, chief intendant of the beeves, Served all with baskets elegant of bread, While all their cups Melanthius charged with wine, And they assail'd at once the ready feast. Meantime Telemachus, with forecast shrewd, Fast by the marble threshold, but within The spacious hall his father placed, to whom A sordid seat he gave and scanty board. A portion of the entrails, next, he set Before him, fill'd a golden goblet high, And thus, in presence of them all, began. There seated now, drink as the suitors drink. I will, myself, their biting taunts forbid, And violence. This edifice is mine, Not public property; my father first Possess'd it, and my right from his descends. Suitors! controul your tongues, nor with your hands Offend, lest contest fierce and war ensue. He ceased; they gnawing, sat, their lips aghast With wonder that Telemachus in his speech Such boldness used. Then spake Eupithes' son, Antinoüs, and the assembly thus address'd. Let pass, ye Greeks! the language of the Prince, Harsh as it is, and big with threats to us. Had Jove permitted, his orations here, Although thus eloquent, ere now had ceased. So spake Antinoüs, whom Ulysses' son Heard unconcern'd. And now the heralds came In solemn pomp, conducting through the streets A sacred hecatomb, when in the grove Umbrageous of Apollo, King shaft-arm'd, The assembled Greecians met. The savoury roast Finish'd, and from the spits withdrawn, each shared His portion of the noble feast, and such As they enjoy'd themselves the attendants placed Before Ulysses, for the Hero's son Himself, Telemachus, had so enjoin'd. But Pallas (that they might exasperate more Ulysses) suffer'd not the suitor Chiefs To banquet, guiltless of heart-piercing scoffs Malign. There was a certain suitor named Ctesippus, born in Samos; base of mind Was he and profligate, but in the wealth Confiding of his father, woo'd the wife Of long-exiled Ulysses. From his seat The haughty suitors thus that man address'd. Ye noble suitors, I would speak; attend! The guest is served; he hath already shared Equal with us; nor less the laws demand Of hospitality; for neither just It were nor decent, that a guest, received Here by Telemachus, should be denied His portion of the feast. Come then—myself Will give to him, that he may also give To her who laved him in the bath, or else To whatsoever menial here he will. So saying, he from a basket near at hand Heaved an ox-foot, and with a vigorous arm Hurl'd it. Ulysses gently bow'd his head, Shunning the blow, but gratified his just Resentment with a broad sardonic A smile of displeasure. smile Of dread significance. He smote the wall. Then thus Telemachus rebuked the deed. Ctesippus, thou art fortunate; the bone Struck not the stranger, for he shunn'd the blow; Else, I had surely thrust my glittering lance Right through thee; then, no hymenæal rites Of thine should have employ'd thy father here, But thy funereal. No man therefore treat Me with indignity within these walls, For though of late a child, I can discern Now, and distinguish between good and ill. Suffice it that we patiently endure To be spectators daily of our sheep Slaughter'd, our bread consumed, our stores of wine Wasted; for what can one to all opposed? Come then—persist no longer in offence And hostile hate of me; or if ye wish To slay me, pause not. It were better far To die, and I had rather much be slain, Than thus to witness your atrocious deeds Day after day; to see our guests abused, With blows insulted, and the women dragg'd With a licentious violence obscene From side to side of all this fair abode. He said, and all sat silent, till at length Thus Agelaüs spake, Diastor's son. My friends! let none with contradiction thwart And rude reply, words rational and just; Assault no more the stranger, nor of all The servants of renown'd Ulysses here Harm any. My advice, both to the Queen And to Telemachus, shall gentle be, May it but please them. While the hope survived Within your bosoms of the safe return Of wise Ulysses to his native isle, So long good reason was that she should use Delay, and hold our wooing in suspence; For had Ulysses come, that course had proved Wisest and best; but that he comes no more Appears now manifest. Thou, therefore, Prince! Seeking thy mother, counsel her to wed The noblest, and who offers richest dower, That thou, for thy peculiar, may'st enjoy Thy own inheritance in peace and ease, And she, departing, find another home. To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied. I swear by Jove, and by my father's woes, Who either hath deceased far from his home, Or lives a wanderer, that I interpose No hindrance to her nuptials. Let her wed Who offers most, and even whom she will. But to dismiss her rudely were a deed Unfilial.—That I dare not;—God forbid! So spake Telemachus. Then Pallas struck The suitors with delirium; wide they stretch'd Their jaws with unspontaneous laughter loud; Their meat dripp'd blood; tears fill'd their eyes, and dire Presages of approaching woe, their hearts. Then thus the prophet Theoclymenus Who had sought refuge in the ship of Telemachus when he left Sparta, and came with him to Ithaca.. Ah miserable men! what curse is this That takes you now? night wraps itself around Your faces, bodies, limbs; the palace shakes With peals of groans—and oh, what floods ye weep! I see the walls and arches dappled thick With gore; the vestibule is throng'd, the court On all sides throng'd with apparitions grim Of slaughter'd men sinking into the gloom Of Erebus; the sun is blotted out From heaven, and midnight whelms you premature. He said, they hearing laugh'd; and thus the son Of Polybus, Eurymachus replied. This wanderer from a distant shore hath left His wits behind. Hoa there! conduct him hence Into the forum; since he dreams it night Already, teach him there that it is day. Then answer'd godlike Theoclymenus. I have no need, Eurymachus, of guides To lead me hence, for I have eyes and ears, The use of both my feet, and of a mind In no respect irrational or wild. These shall conduct me forth, for well I know That evil threatens you, such too as none Shall 'scape of all the suitors, whose delight Is to insult the unoffending guest Received beneath this hospitable roof. He said, and, issuing from the palace, sought Piræus' house, who gladly welcomed him. Then all the suitors on each other cast A look significant, and, to provoke Telemachus the more, fleer'd at his guests. Of whom a youth thus, insolent, began. No living wight, Telemachus, had e'er Guests such as thine. Witness, we know not who, This hungry vagabond, whose means of life Are none, and who hath neither skill nor force To earn them, a mere burthen on the ground. Witness the other also, who upstarts A prophet suddenly. Take my advice; I counsel wisely; send them both on board Some gallant bark to Sicily for sale; Thus shall they somewhat profit thee at last. So spake the suitors, whom Telemachus Heard unconcern'd, and silent, look'd and look'd Toward his father, watching still the time When he should punish that licentious throng. Meantime, Icarius' daughter, who had placed Her splendid seat opposite, heard distinct Their taunting speeches. They, with noisy mirth, Feasted deliciously, for they had slain Many a fat victim; but a sadder feast Than soon the Goddess and the warrior Chief Should furnish for them, none shall ever share, Of which their crimes had furnish'd first the cause. BOOK XXI. ARGUMENT OF THE TWENTY-FIRST BOOK. Penelope proposes to the suitors a contest with the bow, herself the prize. They prove unable to bend the bow; when Ulysses having with some difficulty possessed himself of it, manages it with the utmost ease, and dispatches his arrow through twelve rings erected for the trial. Minerva now, Goddess cœrulean-eyed, Prompted Icarius' daughter, the discrete Penelope, with bow and rings to prove Her suitors in Ulysses' courts, a game Terrible in conclusion to them all. First, taking in her hand the brazen key Well-forged, and fitted with an ivory grasp, Attended by the women of her train She sought her inmost chamber, the recess In which she kept the treasures of her Lord, His brass, his gold, and steel elaborate. Here lay his stubborn bow, and quiver fill'd With numerous shafts, a fatal store. That bow He had received and quiver from the hand Of godlike Iphitus Eurytides, Whom, in Messenia A province of Laconia., in the house he met Of brave Orsilochus. Ulysses came Demanding payment of arrearage due From all that land; for a Messenian fleet Had borne from Ithaca three hundred sheep, With all their shepherds; for which cause, ere yet Adult, he voyaged to that distant shore, Deputed by his sire, and by the Chiefs Of Ithaca, to make the just demand. But Iphitus had thither come to seek Twelve mares and twelve mule colts which he had lost, A search that cost him soon a bloody death. For, coming to the house of Hercules The valiant task-performing son of Jove, He perish'd there, slain by his cruel host Who, heedless of heaven's wrath, and of the rights Of his own board, first fed, then slaughter'd him; For in his house the mares and colts were hidden. He, therefore, occupied in that concern, Meeting Ulysses there, gave him the bow Which, erst, huge Eurytus had borne, and which Himself had from his dying sire received. Ulysses, in return, on him bestow'd A spear and sword, pledges of future love And hospitality; but never more They met each other at the friendly board, For, ere that hour arrived, the son of Jove Slew his own guest, the godlike Iphitus. Thus came the bow into Ulysses' hands, Which never in his gallant barks he bore To battle with him, (though he used it oft In times of peace,) but left it safely stored At home, a dear memorial of his friend. Soon as, divinest of her sex, arrived At that same chamber, with her foot she press'd The oaken threshold bright, on which the hand Of no mean architect had stretch'd the line, Who had erected also on each side The posts on which the splendid portal hung, She loosed the ring and brace, then introduced The key, and aiming The reader will of course observe, that the whole of this process implies a sort of mechanism very different from that with which we are acquainted.—The translation, I believe, is exact. at them from without, Struck back the bolts. The portals, at that stroke, Sent forth a tone deep as the pastured bull's, And flew wide open. She ascending next The elevated floor on which the chests That held her own fragrant apparel stood, With lifted hand aloft took down the bow In its embroider'd bow-case safe enclosed. Then sitting there, she lay'd it on her knees, Weeping aloud, and drew it from the case. Thus weeping over it long time she sat, Till satiate, at the last, with grief and tears, Descending by the palace steps she sought Again the haughty suitors, with the bow Elastic, and the quiver in her hand Replete with pointed shafts, a deadly store. Her maidens, as she went, bore after her A coffer fill'd with prizes by her Lord, Much brass and steel; and when at length she came, Loveliest of women, where the suitors sat, Between the pillars of the stately dome Pausing, before her beauteous face she held Her lucid veil, and by two matrons chaste Supported, the assembly thus address'd. Ye noble suitors, hear, who rudely haunt This palace of a Chief long absent hence, Whose substance ye have now long time consumed, Nor palliative have yet contrived, or could, Save your ambition to make me a bride,— Attend this game to which I call you forth. Now, suitors! prove yourselves with this huge bow Of wide-renown'd Ulysses; he who draws Easiest the bow, and who his arrow sends Through twice six rings, he takes me to his home, And I must leave this mansion of my youth Plenteous, magnificent, which doubtless oft I shall remember even in my dreams. So saying, she bade Eumæus lay the bow Before them, and the twice six rings of steel. He wept, received them, and obey'd; nor wept The herdsman less, seeing the bow which erst His Lord had occupied; when at their tears Indignant, thus, Antinoüs began. Ye rural drones, whose purblind eyes see not Beyond the present hour, egregious fools! Why weeping trouble ye the Queen, too much Before afflicted for her husband lost? Either partake the banquet silently, Or else go weep abroad, leaving the bow, That stubborn test, to us; for none, I judge, None here shall bend this polish'd bow with ease, Since in this whole assembly I discern None like Ulysses, whom myself have seen And recollect, though I was then a boy. He said, but in his heart meantime the hope Cherish'd, that he should bend, himself, the bow, And pass the rings; yet was he destined first Of all that company to taste the steel Of brave Ulysses' shaft, whom in that house He had so oft dishonour'd, and had urged So oft all others to the like offence. Amidst them then the sacred might arose Of young Telemachus, who thus began. Saturnian Jove questionless hath deprived Me of all reason. My own mother, famed For wisdom as she is, makes known to all Her purpose to abandon this abode And follow a new mate, while heedless I Trifle and laugh as I were still a child. But come, ye suitors! since the prize is such, A woman, like to whom none can be found This day in all Achaia; on the shores Of sacred Pylus; in the cities proud Of Argos or Mycenæ; or even here In Ithaca; or yet within the walls Of black Epirus; and since this yourselves Know also, wherefore should I speak her praise? Come then, delay not, waste not time in vain Excuses, turn not from the proof, but bend The bow, that thus the issue may be known. I also will, myself, that task essay; And should I bend the bow, and pass the rings, Then shall not my illustrious mother leave Her son forlorn, forsaking this abode To follow a new spouse, while I remain Disconsolate, although of age to bear, Successful as my sire, the prize away. So saying, he started from his seat, cast off His purple cloak, and lay'd his sword aside, Then fix'd, himself, the rings, furrowing the earth By line, and opening one long trench for all, And stamping close the glebe. Amazement seized All present, seeing with how prompt a skill He executed, though untaught, his task. Then hasting to the portal, there he stood. Thrice, struggling, he essay'd to bend the bow, And thrice desisted, hoping still to draw The bow-string This first attempt of Telemachus and the suitors was not an attempt to shoot, but to lodge the bow-string on the opposite horn, the bow having been released at one end, and slackened while it was laid by. home, and shoot through all the rings. And now the fourth time striving with full force He had prevail'd to string it, but his sire Forbad his eager efforts by a sign. Then thus the royal youth to all around. Gods! either I shall prove of little force Hereafter, and for manly feats unapt, Or I am yet too young, and have not strength To quell the aggressor's contumely. But come— (For ye have strength surpassing mine,) try ye The bow, and bring this contest to an end. He ceased, and set the bow down on the floor, Reclining it against the pannels smooth That lined the wall; the arrow next he placed, Leaning against the bow's bright-polish'd horn, And to the seat, whence he had risen, return'd. Then thus Eupithes' son, Antinoüs spake. My friends! come forth successive from the right Antinoüs prescribes to them this manner of rising to the trial for the good omen's sake, the left hand being held unpropitious., Where he who ministers the cup begins. So spake Antinoüs, and his counsel pleased. Then, first, Leiodes, Œnop's son, arose. He was their soothsayer, and ever sat Beside the beaker, inmost of them all. To him alone of all, licentious deeds Were odious, and with indignation fired, He witness'd the excesses of the rest. He then took foremost up the shaft and bow, And, station'd at the portal, strove to bend But bent it not, fatiguing, first, his hands Delicate and uncustom'd to the toil. He ceased, and the assembly thus bespake. My friends, I speed not; let another try; For many Princes shall this bow of life Bereave, since death more eligible seems, Far more, than loss of her, for whom we meet Continual here, expecting still the prize. Some suitor haply at this moment, hopes That he shall wed whom long he hath desired, Ulysses' wife, Penelope; let him Essay the bow, and trial made, address His spousal offers to some other fair Among the long-stoled Princesses of Greece, This Princess leaving his, whose proffer'd gifts Shall please her most, and whom the Fates ordain. He said, and set the bow down on the floor, Reclining it against the pannels smooth That lined the wall; the arrow, next, he placed, Leaning against the bow's bright-polish'd horn, And to the seat whence he had risen return'd. Then him Antinoüs, angry, thus reproved. What word, Leiodes, grating to our ears Hath 'scaped thy lips? I hear it with disdain. Shall this bow fatal prove to many a Prince, Because thou hast thyself too feeble proved To bend it? no. Thou wast not born to bend The unpliant bow, or to direct the shaft, But here are nobler who shall soon prevail. He said, and to Melanthius gave command, The goat-herd. Hence, Melanthius, kindle fire; Beside it place, with fleeces spread, a form Of length commodious; from within procure A large round cake of suet next, with which When we have chafed and suppled the tough bow Before the fire, we will again essay To bend it, and decide the doubtful strife. He ended, and Melanthius, kindling fire, Beside it placed, with fleeces spread, a form Of length commodious; next he brought a cake Ample and round of suet from within, With which they chafed the bow, then tried again To bend, but bent it not; superior strength To theirs that task required. Yet two, the rest In force surpassing, made no trial yet, Antinoüs, and Eurymachus the brave. Then went the herdsman and the swine-herd forth Together; after whom, the glorious Chief Himself the house left also, and when all Without the court had met, with gentle speech Ulysses, then the faithful pair address'd. Herdsman! and thou, Eumæs! shall I keep A certain secret close, or shall I speak Outright? my spirit prompts me, and I will. What welcome should Ulysses at your hands Receive, arriving suddenly at home, Some God his guide? would ye the suitors aid, Or would ye aid Ulysses? answer true. Then thus the chief intendant of his herds. Would Jove but grant me my desire, to see Once more the Hero, and would some kind Power Restore him, I would show thee soon an arm Strenuous to serve him, and a dauntless heart. Eumæus also fervently implored The Gods in prayer, that they would render back Ulysses to his home. He then convinced Of their unfeigning honesty, began. Behold him! I am he myself, arrived After long sufferings in the twentieth year! I know how welcome to yourselves alone Of all my train I come, for I have heard None others praying for my safe return. I therefore tell you truth; should heaven subdue The suitors under me, ye shall receive Each at my hands a bride, with lands and house Near to my own, and ye shall be thenceforth Dear friends and brothers of the Prince my son. Lo! also this indisputable proof That ye may know and trust me. View it here. It is the scar which in Parnassus erst (Where with the sons I hunted of renown'd Autolycus,) I from a boar received. So saying, he stripp'd his tatters, and unveil'd The whole broad scar; then soon as they had seen And surely recognized the mark, each cast His arms around Ulysses, wept, embraced And press'd him to his bosom, kissing oft His brows and shoulders, who as oft their hands And foreheads kiss'd, nor had the setting sun Beheld them satisfied, but that himself Ulysses thus admonished them, and said. Cease now from tears, lest any, coming forth, Mark and report them to our foes within. Now to the hall again, but one by one, Not all at once, I foremost, then yourselves, And this shall be the sign. Full well I know That all unanimous, they will oppose Delivery of the bow and shafts to me; But thou, (proceeding with it to my seat) Eumæus, noble friend! shalt give the bow Into my grasp; then bid the women close The massy doors, and should they hear a groan Or other noise made by the Princes shut Within the hall, let none set step abroad, But all work silent. Be the palace-door Thy charge, my good Philœtius! key it fast Without a moment's pause, and fix the brace The ?????? seems to have been a strap designed to close the only aperture by which the bolt could be displaced, and the door opened.. He ended, and returning to the hall, Resumed his seat; nor stay'd his servants long Without, but follow'd their illustrious Lord. Eurymachus was busily employ'd Turning the bow, and chafing it before The sprightly blaze, but after all could find No power to bend it. Disappointment wrung A groan from his proud heart, and thus he said. Alas! not only for myself I grieve, But grieve for all. Nor though I mourn the loss Of such a bride, mourn I that loss alone, (For lovely Greecians may be found no few In Ithaca, and in the neighbour isles,) But should we so inferior prove at last To brave Ulysses, that no force of ours Can bend his bow, we are for ever shamed. To whom Antinoüs, thus, Eupithes' son. Not so; (as even thou art well-assured Thyself, Eurymachus!) but Phœbus claims This day his own. Who then, on such a day, Would strive to bend it? Let it rather rest. And should we leave the rings where now they stand, I trust that none entering Ulysses' house Will dare displace them. Cup-bearer, attend! Serve all with wine, that, first, libation made, We may religiously lay down the bow. Command ye too Melanthius, that he drive Hither the fairest goats of all his flocks At dawn of day, that burning first the thighs To the ethereal archer, we may make New trial, and decide at length the strife. So spake Antinoüs, and his counsel pleased. The heralds then pour'd water on their hands, While youths crown'd high the goblets which they bore From right to left, distributing to all. When each had made libation, and had drunk Till well sufficed, then, artful to effect His shrewd designs, Ulysses thus began. Hear, O ye suitors of the illustrious Queen, My bosom's dictates. But I shall entreat Chiefly Eurymachus and the godlike youth Antinoüs, whose advice is wisely given. Tamper no longer with the bow, but leave The matter with the Gods, who shall decide The strife to-morrow, favouring whom they will. Meantime, grant me the polish'd bow, that I May trial make among you of my force, If I retain it still in like degree As erst, or whether wandering and defect Of nourishment have worn it all away. He said, whom they with indignation heard Extreme, alarm'd lest he should bend the bow, And sternly thus Antinoüs replied. Desperate vagabond! ah wretch deprived Of reason utterly! art not content? Esteem'st it not distinction proud enough To feast with us the nobles of the land? None robs thee of thy share, thou witnessest Our whole discourse, which, save thyself alone, No needy vagrant is allow'd to hear. Thou art befool'd by wine, as many have been, Wide-throated drinkers, unrestrain'd by rule. Wine in the mansion of the mighty Chief Pirithoüs, made the valiant Centaur mad Eurytion, at the Lapithæan When Pirithoüs, one of the Lapithæ, married Hippodamia, daughter of Adrastus, he invited the Centaurs to the wedding. The Centaurs, intoxicated with wine, attempted to ravish the wives of the Lapithæ, who, in resentment of that insult, slew them. feast. He drank to drunkenness, and being drunk, Committed great enormities beneath Pirithoüs' roof, and such as fill'd with rage The Hero-guests, who therefore by his feet Dragg'd him right through the vestibule, amerced Of nose and ears, and he departed thence Provoked to frenzy by that foul disgrace, Whence war between the human kind arose And the bold Centaurs—but he first incurred By his ebriety that mulct severe. Great evil also if thou bend the bow, To thee I prophecy; for thou shalt find Advocate or protector none in all This people, but we will dispatch thee hence Incontinent on board a sable bark To Echetus, the scourge of human kind, From whom is no escape. Drink then in peace, And contest shun with younger men than thou. Him answer'd then Penelope discrete. Antinoüs! neither seemly were the deed Nor just, to maim or harm whatever guest Whom here arrived Telemachus receives. Canst thou expect, that should he even prove Stronger than ye, and bend the massy bow, He will conduct me hence to his own home, And make me his own bride? No such design His heart conceives, or hope; nor let a dread So vain the mind of any overcloud Who banquets here, since it dishonours me. So she; to whom Eurymachus reply'd, Offspring of Polybus. O matchless Queen! Icarius' prudent daughter! none suspects That thou wilt wed with him; a mate so mean Should ill become thee; but we fear the tongues Of either sex, lest some Achaian say Hereafter, (one inferior far to us) Ah! how unworthy are they to compare With him whose wife they seek! to bend his bow Pass'd all their power, yet this poor vagabond, Arriving from what country none can tell, Bent it with ease, and shot through all the rings. So will they speak, and so shall we be shamed. Then answer thus Penelope return'd. No fair report, Eurymachus, attends Their names or can, who, riotous as ye, The house dishonour and consume the wealth Of such a Chief. Why shame ye thus yourselves? The guest is of athletic frame, well form'd, And large of limb! he boasts him also sprung From noble ancestry. Come then—consent— Give him the bow, that we may see the proof; For thus I say, and thus will I perform; Sure as he bends it, and Apollo gives To him that glory, tunic fair and cloak Shall be his meed from me, a javelin keen To guard him against men and dogs, a sword Of double edge, and sandals for his feet, And I will send him whither most he would. Her answer'd then prudent Telemachus. Mother—the bow is mine; and save myself, No Greek hath right to give it, or refuse. None who in rock-bound Ithaca possess Dominion, none in the steed-pastured isles Of Elis, if I chose to make the bow His own for ever, should that choice controul. But thou into the house repairing, ply Spindle and loom, thy province, and enjoin Diligence to thy maidens; for the bow Is man's concern alone, and shall be mine Especially, since I am master here. She heard astonish'd, and the prudent speech Reposing of her son deep in her heart, Withdrew; then mounting with her female train To her superior chamber, there she wept Her lost Ulysses, till Minerva bathed With balmy dews of sleep her weary lids. And now the noble swine-herd bore the bow Toward Ulysses, but with one voice all The suitors, clamorous, reproved the deed, Of whom a youth thus insolent exclaim'd. Thou clumsy swine-herd, whither bear'st the bow, Delirious wretch? the hounds that thou hast train'd Shall eat thee at thy solitary home Ere long, let but Apollo prove, at last, Propitious to us, and the Powers of heaven. So they, whom hearing he replaced the bow Where erst he stood, terrified at the sound Of such loud menaces; on the other side Telemachus as loud assail'd his ear. Friend! forward with the bow; or soon repent That thou obey'dst the many. I will else With huge stones drive thee, younger as I am, Back to the field. My strength surpasses thine. I would to heaven that I in force excell'd As far, and prowess, every suitor here! So would I soon give rude dismission hence To some, who live but to imagine harm. He ceased, whose words the suitors laughing heard, And for their sake, in part their wrath resign'd Against Telemachus; then through the hall Eumæus bore, and to Ulysses' hand Consign'd the bow; next summoning abroad The ancient nurse, he gave her thus in charge. It is the pleasure of Telemachus, Sage Euryclea! that thou key secure The doors; and should ye hear perchance a groan Or other noise made by the Princes shut Within the hall, let none look curious forth, But each in quietness pursue her work. So he; nor flew his words useless away, But she incontinent shut fast the doors. Then noiseless sprang Philœtius forth, who closed The portals also of the palace-court. A ship-rope of Ægyptian reed, it chanced, Lay in the vestibule; with that he braced The doors securely, and re-entering fill'd Again his seat, but watchful eyed his Lord. He now assaying with his hand the bow, Made curious trial of it every way, And turn'd it on all sides, lest haply worms Had in its master's absence drill'd the horn. Then thus a suitor to his next remark'd. He hath an eye methinks exactly skill'd In bows, and steals them; or perhaps at home Hath such himself, or feels a strong desire To make them; so inquisitive the rogue Adept in mischief, shifts it to and fro! To whom another insolent replied. I wish him like prosperity in all His efforts, as attends his effort made On this same bow, which he shall never bend. So they; but when the wary Hero wise Had made his hand familiar with the bow Poising it and examining—at once— As when in harp and song adept, a bard Unlabouring strains the chord to a new lyre, The twisted entrails of a sheep below With fingers nice inserting, and above, With such facility Ulysses bent His own huge bow, and with his right hand play'd The nerve, which in its quick vibration sang Clear as the swallow's voice. Keen anguish seized The suitors, wan grew every cheek, and Jove Gave him his rolling thunder for a sign. That omen, granted to him by the son Of wily Saturn, with delight he heard. He took a shaft that at the table side Lay ready drawn; but in his quiver's womb The rest yet slept, by those Achaians proud To be, ere long, experienced. True he lodged The arrow on the centre of the bow, And, occupying still his seat, drew home Nerve and notch'd arrow-head; with steadfast sight He aim'd and sent it; right through all the rings From first to last the steel-charged weapon flew Issuing beyond, and to his son he spake. Thou need'st not blush, young Prince, to have received A guest like me; neither my arrow swerved, Nor labour'd I long time to draw the bow; My strength is unimpair'd, not such as these In scorn affirm it. But the waning day Calls us to supper, This is an instance of the ????????? ???? ????? mentioned in Book XX.; such as, perhaps, could not be easily paralleled. I question if there be a passage, either in ancient or modern tragedy, so truly terrible as this seeming levity of Ulysses, in the moment when he was going to begin the slaughter. after which succeeds Jocund variety, the song, the harp, With all that heightens and adorns the feast. He said, and with his brows gave him the sign. At once the son of the illustrious Chief Slung his keen faulchion, grasp'd his spear, and stood Arm'd bright for battle at his father's side. BOOK XXII. ARGUMENT OF THE TWENTY-SECOND BOOK. Ulysses, with some little assistance from Telemachus, Eumæus, and Philœtius, slays all the suitors, and twelve of the female servants who had allowed themselves in illicit intercourse with them, are hanged. Melanthius also is punished with miserable mutilation. Then, girding up his rags, Ulysses sprang With bow and full-charged quiver to the door; Loose on the broad stone at his feet he pour'd His arrows, and the suitors thus bespake. This prize, though difficult, hath been atchieved. Now for another mark which never man Struck yet, but I will strike it if I may, And if Apollo make that glory mine. He said, and at Antinoüs aimed direct A bitter shaft; he, purposing to drink, Both hands advanced toward the golden cup Twin-ear'd, nor aught suspected death so nigh. For who, at the full banquet, could suspect That any single guest, however brave, Should plan his death, and execute the blow? Yet him Ulysses with an arrow pierced Full in the throat, and through his neck behind Started the glittering point. Aslant he droop'd; Down fell the goblet, through his nostrils flew The spouted blood, and spurning with his foot The board, he spread his viands in the dust. Confusion, when they saw Antinoüs fall'n, Seized all the suitors; from the thrones they sprang, Flew every way, and on all sides explored The palace-walls, but neither sturdy lance As erst, nor buckler could they there discern. Then, furious, to Ulysses thus they spake. Thy arrow, stranger, was ill-aim'd; a man Is no just mark. Thou never shalt dispute Prize more. Inevitable death is thine. For thou hast slain a Prince noblest of all In Ithaca, and shalt be vultures' food. Various their judgments were, but none believed That he had slain him wittingly, nor saw The infatuate men fate hovering o'er them all. Then thus Ulysses, louring dark, replied. O dogs! not fearing aught my safe return From Ilium, ye have shorn my substance close, Lain with my women forcibly, and sought, While yet I lived, to make my consort yours, Heedless of the inhabitants of heaven Alike, and of the just revenge of man. But death is on the wing; death for you all. He said; their cheeks all faded at the sound, And each with sharpen'd eyes search'd every nook For an escape from his impending doom, Till thus, alone, Eurymachus replied. If thou indeed art he, the mighty Chief Of Ithaca return'd, thou hast rehearsed With truth the crimes committed by the Greeks Frequent, both in thy house and in thy field. But he, already, who was cause of all, Lies slain, Antinoüs; he thy palace fill'd With outrage, not solicitous so much To win the fair Penelope, but thoughts Far different framing, which Saturnian Jove Hath baffled all; to rule himself supreme In noble Ithaca, when he had kill'd By an insidious stratagem thy son. But he is slain. Now therefore, spare thy own, Thy people; public reparation due Shall sure be thine, and to appease thy wrath For all the waste that, eating, drinking here We have committed, we will yield thee, each, Full twenty beeves, gold paying thee beside And brass, till joy shall fill thee at the sight, However just thine anger was before. To whom Ulysses, frowning stern, replied. Eurymachus, would ye contribute each His whole inheritance, and other sums Still add beside, ye should not, even so, These hands of mine bribe to abstain from blood, Till every suitor suffer for his wrong. Ye have your choice. Fight with me, or escape (Whoever may) the terrours of his fate, But ye all perish, if my thought be true. He ended, they with trembling knees and hearts All heard, whom thus Eurymachus address'd. To your defence, my friends! for respite none Will he to his victorious hands afford, But arm'd with bow and quiver, will dispatch Shafts from the door till he have slain us all. Therefore to arms—draw each his sword—oppose The tables to his shafts, and all at once Rush on him; that dislodging him at least From portal and from threshold, we may give The city on all sides a loud alarm, So shall this archer soon have shot his last. Thus saying, he drew his brazen faulchion keen Of double edge, and with a dreadful cry Sprang on him; but Ulysses with a shaft In that same moment through his bosom driven Transfix'd his liver, and down dropp'd his sword. He, staggering around his table, fell Convolved in agonies, and overturn'd Both food and wine; his forehead smote the floor; Woe fill'd his heart, and spurning with his heels His vacant seat, he shook it till he died. Then with his faulchion drawn, Amphinomus Advanced to drive Ulysses from the door, And fierce was his assault; but, from behind, Telemachus between his shoulders fix'd A brazen lance, and urged it through his breast. Full on his front, with hideous sound, he fell. Leaving the weapon planted in his spine Back flew Telemachus, lest had he stood Drawing it forth, some enemy, perchance, Should either pierce him with a sudden thrust Oblique, or hew him with a downright edge. Swift, therefore, to his father's side he ran, Whom reaching, in wing'd accents thus he said. My father! I will now bring thee a shield, An helmet, and two spears: I will enclose Myself in armour also, and will give Both to the herdsmen and Eumæus arms Expedient now, and needful for us all. To whom Ulysses, ever wise, replied. Run; fetch them, while I yet have arrows left, Lest, single, I be justled from the door. He said, and at his word, forth went the Prince, Seeking the chamber where he had secured The armour. Thence he took four shields, eight spears, With four hair-crested helmets, charged with which He hasted to his father's side again, And, arming first himself, furnish'd with arms His two attendants. Then, all clad alike In splendid brass, beside the dauntless Chief Ulysses, his auxiliars firm they stood. He while a single arrow unemploy'd Lay at his foot, right-aiming, ever pierced Some suitor through, and heaps on heaps they fell. But when his arrows fail'd the royal Chief, His bow reclining at the portal's side Against the palace-wall, he slung himself A four-fold buckler on his arm, he fix'd A casque whose crest waved awful o'er his brows On his illustrious head, and fill'd his gripe With two stout spears, well-headed both with brass. There was a certain postern If the ancients found it difficult to ascertain clearly the situation of this ????????, well may we. The Translator has given it the position which to him appeared most probable.—There seem to have been two of these posterns, one leading to a part from which the town might be alarmed, the other to the chamber to which Telemachus went for armour. There was one, perhaps, on each side of the portal, and they appear to have been at some height above the floor. in the wall At the gate-side, the customary pass Into a narrow street, but barr'd secure. Ulysses bade his faithful swine-herd watch That egress, station'd near it, for it own'd One sole approach; then Agelaüs loud Exhorting all the suitors, thus exclaim'd. Oh friends! will none, ascending to the door Of yonder postern, summon to our aid The populace, and spread a wide alarm? So shall this archer soon have shot his last. To whom the keeper of the goats replied Melanthius. Agelaüs! Prince renown'd! That may not be. The postern and the gate At which Ulysses stood. Neighbour too near each other, and to force The narrow egress were a vain attempt; One valiant man might thence repulse us all. But come—myself will furnish you with arms Fetch'd from above; for there, as I suppose, (And not elsewhere) Ulysses, and his son Have hidden them, and there they shall be found. So spake Melanthius, and ascending sought Ulysses' chambers through the winding stairs And galleries of the house. Twelve bucklers thence He took, as many spears, and helmets bright As many, shagg'd with hair, then swift return'd And gave them to his friends. Trembled the heart Of brave Ulysses, and his knees, at sight Of his opposers putting armour on, And shaking each his spear; arduous indeed Now seem'd his task, and in wing'd accents brief Thus to his son Telemachus he spake. Either some woman of our train contrives Hard battle for us, furnishing with arms The suitors, or Melanthius arms them all. Him answer'd then Telemachus discrete. Father, this fault was mine, and be it charged On none beside; I left the chamber-door Unbarr'd, which, more attentive than myself, Their spy perceived. But haste, Eumæus, shut The chamber-door, observing well, the while, If any woman of our train have done This deed, or whether, as I more suspect, Melanthius, Dolius' son, have given them arms. Thus mutual they conferr'd; meantime, again Melanthius to the chamber flew in quest Of other arms. Eumæus, as he went, Mark'd him, and to Ulysses thus he spake. Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd! Behold, the traitor, whom ourselves supposed, Seeks yet again the chamber! Tell me plain, Shall I, should I superior prove in force, Slay him, or shall I drag him thence to thee, That he may suffer at thy hands the doom Due to his treasons perpetrated oft Against thee, here, even in thy own house? Then answer thus Ulysses shrewd return'd. I, with Telemachus, will here immew The lordly suitors close, rage as they may. Ye two, the while, bind fast Melanthius' hands And feet behind his back, then cast him bound Into the chamber, and (the door secured) Pass underneath his arms a double chain, And by a pillar's top weigh him aloft Till he approach the rafters, there to endure, Living long time, the miseries he hath earn'd. He spake; they prompt obey'd; together both They sought the chamber, whom the wretch within Heard not, exploring every nook for arms. They watching stood the door, from which, at length, Forth came Melanthius, bearing in one hand A casque, and in the other a broad shield Time-worn and chapp'd with drought, which in his youth Warlike Laertes had been wont to bear. Long time neglected it had lain, till age Had loosed the sutures of its bands. At once Both springing on him, seized and drew him in Forcibly by his locks, then cast him down Prone on the pavement, trembling at his fate. With painful stricture of the cord his hands They bound and feet together at his back, As their illustrious master had enjoin'd, Then weigh'd him with a double chain aloft, By a tall pillar to the palace-roof, And thus, deriding him, Eumæus spake. Now, good Melanthius, on that fleecy bed Reclined, as well befits thee, thou wilt watch All night, nor when the golden dawn forsakes The ocean stream, will she escape thine eye, But thou wilt duly to the palace drive The fattest goats, a banquet for thy friends. So saying, he left him in his dreadful sling. Then arming both, and barring fast the door, They sought brave Laertiades again. And now, courageous at the portal stood Those four, by numbers in the interior house Opposed of adversaries fierce in arms, When Pallas, in the form and with the voice Approach'd of Mentor, whom Laertes' son Beheld, and joyful at the sight, exclaim'd. Help, Mentor! help—now recollect a friend And benefactor, born when thou wast born. So he, not unsuspicious that he saw Pallas, the heroine of heaven. Meantime The suitors fill'd with menaces the dome, And Agelaüs first, Damastor's son, In accents harsh rebuked the Goddess thus. Beware, oh Mentor! that he lure thee not To oppose the suitors and to aid himself, For thus will we. Ulysses and his son Both slain, in vengeance of thy purposed deeds Against us, we will slay thee next, and thou With thy own head shalt satisfy the wrong. Your force thus quell'd in battle, all thy wealth Whether in house or field, mingled with his, We will confiscate, neither will we leave Or son of thine, or daughter in thy house Alive, nor shall thy virtuous consort more Within the walls of Ithaca be seen. He ended, and his words with wrath inflamed Minerva's heart the more; incensed, she turn'd Toward Ulysses, whom she thus reproved. Thou neither own'st the courage nor the force, Ulysses now, which nine whole years thou showd'st At Ilium, waging battle obstinate For high-born Helen, and in horrid fight Destroying multitudes, till thy advice At last lay'd Priam's bulwark'd city low. Why, in possession of thy proper home And substance, mourn'st thou want of power to oppose The suitors? Stand beside me, mark my deeds, And thou shalt own Mentor Alcimides A valiant friend, and mindful of thy love. She spake; nor made she victory as yet Entire his own, proving the valour, first, Both of the sire and of his glorious son, But, springing in a swallow's form aloft, Perch'd on a rafter of the splendid roof. Then, Agelaüs animated loud The suitors, whom Eurynomus also roused, Amphimedon, and Demoptolemus, And Polyctorides, Pisander named, And Polybus the brave; for noblest far Of all the suitor chiefs who now survived And fought for life were these. The bow had quell'd And shafts, in quick succession sent, the rest. Then Agelaüs thus harangued them all. We soon shall tame, O friends, this warrior's might, Whom Mentor, after all his airy vaunts Hath left, and at the portal now remain Themselves alone. Dismiss not therefore, all, Your spears together, but with six alone Assail them first; Jove willing, we shall pierce Ulysses, and subduing him, shall slay With ease the rest; their force is safely scorn'd. He ceased; and, as he bade, six hurl'd the spear Together; but Minerva gave them all A devious flight; The deviation of three only is described, which must be understood, therefore, as instances of the ill success of all. one struck a column, one The planks of the broad portal, and a third Flung right his ashen beam ponderous with brass Against the wall. Then (every suitor's spear Eluded) thus Ulysses gave the word— Now friends! I counsel you that ye dismiss Your spears at them, who not content with past Enormities, thirst also for our blood. He said, and with unerring aim all threw Their glittering spears. Ulysses on the ground Stretch'd Demoptolemus; Euryades Fell by Telemachus; the swine-herd slew El?tus, and the keeper of the beeves Pisander; in one moment all alike Lay grinding with their teeth the dusty floor. Back flew the suitors to the farthest wall, On whom those valiant four advancing, each Recover'd quick his weapon from the dead. Then hurl'd the desperate suitors yet again Their glittering spears, but Pallas gave to each A frustrate course; one struck a column, one The planks of the broad portal, and a third Flung full his ashen beam against the wall. Yet pierced Amphimedon the Prince's wrist, But slightly, a skin-wound, and o'er his shield Ctesippus reach'd the shoulder of the good Eumæus, but his glancing weapon swift O'erflew the mark, and fell. And now the four, Ulysses, dauntless Hero, and his friends All hurl'd their spears together in return. Himself Ulysses, city-waster Chief, Wounded Eurydamas; Ulysses' son Amphimedon; the swine-herd Polybus; And in his breast the keeper of the beeves Ctesippus, glorying over whom, he cried. Oh son of Polytherses! whose delight Hath been to taunt and jeer, never again Boast foolishly, but to the Gods commit Thy tongue, since they are mightier far than thou. Take this—a compensation for thy pledge Of hospitality, the huge ox-hoof, Which while he roam'd the palace, begging alms, Ulysses at thy bounteous hand received. So gloried he; then grasping still his spear, Ulysses pierced Damastor's son, and next Telemachus, enforcing his long beam Sheer through his bowels and his back, transpierced Leiocritus; he prostrate smote the floor. Then Pallas from the lofty roof held forth Her host-confounding Ægis o'er their heads, Withering their souls with fear. They through the hall Fled, scatter'd as an herd, which rapid-wing'd The gad-fly dissipates, infester fell Of beeves, when vernal suns shine hot and long. In this simile we seem to have a curious account of the ancient manner of fowling. The nets (for ????? is used in that sense by Aristophanes) were spread on a plain; on an adjoining rising ground were stationed they who had charge of the vultures, (such Homer calls them) which were trained to the sport. The alarm being given to the birds below, the vultures were loosed, when if any of them escaped their talons, the nets were ready to enclose them. See Eustathius. Dacier. Clarke.But, as when bow-beak'd vultures crooked-claw'd Stoop from the mountains on the smaller fowl; Terrified at the toils that spread the plain The flock takes wing, they, darting from above, Strike, seize, and slay, resistance or escape Is none, the fowler's heart leaps with delight; So they, pursuing through the spacious hall The suitors, smote them on all sides, their heads Sounded beneath the sword, with hideous groans The palace rang, and the floor foam'd with blood. Then flew Leiodes to Ulysses' knees, Which clasping, in wing'd accents thus he cried. I clasp thy knees, Ulysses! oh respect My suit, and spare me! Never have I word Injurious spoken, or injurious deed Attempted 'gainst the women of thy house, But others, so transgressing, oft forbad. Yet they abstain'd not, and a dreadful fate Due to their wickedness have therefore found. But I, their soothsayer alone, must fall, Though unoffending; such is the return By mortals made for benefits received! To whom Ulysses, louring-dark, replied. Is that thy boast? Hast thou indeed for these The seer's high office fill'd? Then doubtless oft Thy prayer hath been that distant far might prove The day delectable of my return, And that my consort might thy own become To bear thee children; wherefore thee I doom To a dire death which thou shalt not avoid. So saying, he caught the faulchion from the floor Which Agelaüs had let fall, and smote Leiodes, while he kneel'd, athwart his neck So suddenly, that ere his tongue had ceased To plead for life, his head was in the dust. But Phemius, son of Terpius, bard divine, Who, through compulsion, with his song regaled The suitors, a like dreadful death escaped. Fast by the postern, harp in hand, he stood, Doubtful if, issuing, he should take his seat Beside the altar of Hercæan So called because he was worshipped within the ????? or wall that surrounded the court. Jove, Where oft Ulysses offer'd, and his sire, Fat thighs of beeves, or whether he should haste, An earnest suppliant, to embrace his knees. That course, at length, most pleased him; then between The beaker and an argent studded throne He grounded his sweet lyre, and seizing fast The Hero's knees, him suppliant thus address'd. I clasp thy knees, Ulysses! oh respect My suit, and spare me. Thou shalt not escape Regret thyself hereafter, if thou slay Me, charmer of the woes of Gods and men. Self-taught am I, and treasure in my mind Themes of all argument from heaven inspired, And I can sing to thee as to a God. Ah then behead me not! Put even the wish Far from thee! for thy own beloved son Can witness, that not drawn by choice, or driven By stress of want, resorting to thine house I have regaled these revellers so oft, But under force of mightier far than I. So he; whose words soon as the sacred might Heard of Telemachus, approaching quick His father, thus humane he interposed. Hold—Harm not with the vengeful faulchion's edge This blameless man; and we will also spare Medon the herald, who hath ever been A watchful guardian of my boyish years, Unless Philœtius have already slain him, Or else Eumæus, or thyself, perchance, Unconscious, in the tumult of our foes. He spake, whom Medon hearing (for he lay Beneath a throne, and in a new-stript hide Enfolded, trembling with the dread of death,) Sprang from his hiding-place, and casting off The skin, flew to Telemachus, embraced His knees, and in wing'd accents thus exclaim'd. Prince! I am here—oh, pity me! repress Thine own, and pacify thy father's wrath, That he destroy not me, through fierce revenge Of their iniquities who have consumed His wealth, and in their folly scorn'd his son. To whom Ulysses, ever wise, replied, Smiling complacent. Fear not; my own son Hath pleaded for thee. Therefore (taught thyself That truth) teach others the superior worth Of benefits with injuries compared. But go ye forth, thou and the sacred bard, That ye may sit distant in yonder court From all this carnage, while I give command Myself concerning it, to those within. He ceased; they going forth, took each his seat Beside Jove's altar, but with careful looks Suspicious, dreading without cease the sword. Meantime Ulysses search'd his hall in quest Of living foes, if any still survived Unpunish'd; but he found them all alike Weltering in dust and blood; numerous they lay Like fishes when they strew the sinuous shore Of Ocean, from the grey gulf drawn aground In nets of many a mesh; they on the sands Lie spread, athirst for the salt wave, till hot The gazing sun dries all their life away; So lay the suitors heap'd, and thus at length The prudent Chief gave order to his son. Telemachus; bid Euryclea come Quickly, the nurse, to whom I would impart The purpose which now occupies me most. He said; obedient to his sire, the Prince Smote on the door, and summon'd loud the nurse. Arise, thou ancient governess of all Our female menials, and come forth; attend My father; he hath somewhat for thine ear. So he; nor flew his words useless away, For throwing wide the portal, forth she came, And by Telemachus conducted, found Ere long Ulysses amid all the slain, With blood defiled and dust; dread he appear'd As from the pastured ox newly-devour'd The lion stalking back; his ample chest With gory drops and his broad cheeks are hung, Tremendous spectacle! such seem'd the Chief, Blood-stain'd all over. She the carnage spread On all sides seeing, and the pools of blood, Felt impulse forcible to publish loud That wond'rous triumph; but her lord repress'd The shout of rapture ere it burst abroad, And in wing'd accents thus his will enforced. Silent exult, O ancient matron dear! Shout not, be still. Unholy is the voice Of loud thanksgiving over slaughter'd men. Their own atrocious deeds and the Gods' will Have slain all these; for whether noble guest Arrived or base, they scoff'd at all alike, And for their wickedness have therefore died. But say; of my domestic women, who Have scorn'd me, and whom find'st thou innocent? To whom good Euryclea thus replied. My son! I will declare the truth; thou keep'st Female domestics fifty in thy house, Whom we have made intelligent to comb The fleece, and to perform whatever task. Of these, twice six have overpass'd the bounds Of modesty, respecting neither me, Nor yet the Queen; and thy own son, adult So lately, no permission had from her To regulate the women of her train. But I am gone, I fly with what hath pass'd To the Queen's ear, who nought suspects, so sound She sleeps, by some divinity composed. Then answer thus Ulysses wise return'd. Hush, and disturb her not. Go. Summon first Those wantons, who have long deserved to die. He ceased; then issued forth the ancient dame To summon those bad women, and, meantime, Calling his son, Philœtius, and Eumæus, Ulysses in wing'd accents thus began. Bestir ye, and remove the dead; command Those women also to your help; then cleanse With bibulous sponges and with water all The seats and tables; when ye shall have thus Set all in order, lead those women forth, And in the centre of the spacious court, Between the scullery and the outer-wall Smite them with your broad faulchions till they lose In death the memory of their secret loves Indulged with wretches lawless as themselves. He ended, and the damsels came at once All forth, lamenting, and with tepid tears Showering the ground; with mutual labour, first, Bearing the bodies forth into the court, They lodged them in the portico; meantime Ulysses stern enjoin'd them haste, and urged By sad necessity, they bore all out. With sponges and with water next they cleansed The thrones and tables, while Telemachus Besom'd the floor, Eumæus in that work Aiding him and the keeper of the beeves, And those twelve damsels bearing forth the soil. Thus order given to all within, they next Led forth the women, whom they shut between The scullery and the outer-wall in close Durance, from which no prisoner could escape, And thus Telemachus discrete began. An honourable death is not for these By my advice, who have so often heap'd Reproach on mine and on my mother's head, And held lewd commerce with the suitor-train. He said, and noosing a strong galley-rope To an huge column, led the cord around The spacious dome, suspended so aloft That none with quivering feet might reach the floor. As when a flight of doves entering the copse, Or broad-wing'd thrushes, strike against the net Within, ill rest entangled there they find, So they, suspended by the neck, expired All in one line together. Death abhorr'd! With restless feet awhile they beat the air, Then ceased. And now through vestibule and hall They led Melanthius forth. With ruthless steel They pared away his ears and nose, pluck'd forth His parts of shame, destined to feed the dogs, And still indignant, lopp'd his hands and feet. Then, laving each his feet and hands, they sought Again Ulysses; all their work was done, And thus the Chief to Euryclea spake. Bright blast-averting sulphur, nurse, bring fire! That I may fumigate my walls; then bid Penelope with her attendants down, And summon all the women of her train. But Euryclea thus his nurse replied. My son! thou hast well said; yet will I first Serve thee with vest and mantle. Stand not here In thy own palace cloathed with tatters foul And beggarly,—she will abhor the sight. Then answer thus Ulysses wise return'd. Not so. Bring fire for fumigation first. He said; nor Euryclea his loved nurse Longer delay'd, but sulphur brought and fire, When he with purifying steams himself Visited every part, the banquet-room, The vestibule, the court. Ranging meantime His house magnificent, the matron call'd The women to attend their Lord in haste, And they attended, bearing each a torch. Then gather'd they around him all, sincere Welcoming his return; with close embrace Enfolding him, each kiss'd his brows, and each His shoulders, and his hands lock'd fast in hers. He, irresistible the impulse felt To sigh and weep, well recognizing all. BOOK XXIII. ARGUMENT OF THE TWENTY-THIRD BOOK. Ulysses, with some difficulty, convinces Penelope of his identity, who, at length, overcome by force of evidence, receives him to her arms with transport. He entertains her with a recital of his adventures, and in his narration the principal events of the poem are recapitulated. In the morning, Ulysses, Telemachus, the herdsman and the swine-herd, depart into the country. And now, with exultation loud the nurse Again ascended, eager to apprize The Queen of her Ulysses' safe return; Joy braced her knees, with nimbleness of youth She stepp'd, and at her ear, her thus bespake. Arise, Penelope! dear daughter, see With thy own eyes thy daily wish fulfill'd. Ulysses is arrived; hath reach'd at last His native home, and all those suitors proud Hath slaughter'd, who his family distress'd, His substance wasted, and controul'd his son. To whom Penelope discrete replied. Dear nurse! the Gods have surely taken away Thy judgement; they transform the wise to fools, And fools conduct to wisdom, and have marr'd Thy intellect, who wast discrete before. Why wilt thou mock me, wretched as I am, With tales extravagant? and why disturb Those slumbers sweet that seal'd so fast mine eyes? For such sweet slumbers have I never known Since my Ulysses on his voyage sail'd To that bad city never to be named. Down instant to thy place again—begone— For had another of my maidens dared Disturb my sleep with tidings wild as these, I had dismiss'd her down into the house More roughly; but thine age excuses thee. To whom the venerable matron thus. I mock thee not, my child; no—he is come— Himself, Ulysses, even as I say, That stranger, object of the scorn of all. Telemachus well knew his sire arrived, But prudently conceal'd the tidings, so To ensure the more the suitors' punishment. So Euryclea; she transported heard, And springing from the bed, wrapp'd in her arms The ancient woman, shedding tears of joy, And in wing'd accents ardent thus replied. Ah then, dear nurse, inform me! tell me true! Hath he indeed arrived as thou declarest? How dared he to assail alone that band Of shameless ones, for ever swarming here? Then Euryclea thus matron beloved. I nothing saw or knew; but only heard Groans of the wounded; in the interior house We trembling sat, and every door was fast. Thus all remain'd, till by his father sent, Thy own son call'd me forth. Going I found Ulysses compass'd by the slaughter'd dead. They cover'd wide the pavement, heaps on heaps. It would have cheer'd thy heart to have beheld Thy husband lion-like with crimson stains Of slaughter and of dust all dappled o'er. Heap'd in the portal, at this moment, lie Their bodies, and he fumigates, meantime, The house with sulphur and with flames of fire, And hath himself sent me to bid thee down. Follow me then that ye may give your hearts To gladness both, for ye have much endured; But the event, so long your soul's desire, Is come; himself hath to his household Gods Alive return'd, thee and his son he finds Unharm'd and at your home, nor hath he left Unpunish'd one of all his enemies. Her answer'd then Penelope discrete. Ah dearest nurse! indulge not to excess This dangerous triumph. Thou art well apprized How welcome his appearance here would prove To all, but chief to me and to his son, Fruit of our love. But these things are not so; Some God, resentful of their evil deeds, And of their biting contumely severe, Hath slain those proud; for whether noble guest Arrived or base, alike they scoff'd at all, And for their wickedness have therefore died. But my Ulysses distant far, I know, From Greece hath perish'd, and returns no more. To whom thus Euryclea, nurse beloved. What word, my daughter, hath escaped thy lips, Who thus affirm'st thy husband, now within And at his own hearth-side, for ever lost? Canst thou be thus incredulous? Hear again— I give thee yet proof past dispute, his scar Imprinted by a wild-boar's ivory tusk. Laving him I remark'd it, and desired, Myself, to tell thee, but he, ever wise, Compressing with both hands my lips, forbad. Come, follow me. My life shall be the pledge. If I deceive thee, kill me as thou wilt. To whom Penelope discrete replied. Ah, dearest nurse, sagacious as thou art, Thou little know'st to scan the counsels wise Of the eternal Gods. But let us seek My son, however, that I may behold The suitors dead, and him by whom they died. So saying, she left her chamber, musing much In her descent, whether to interrogate Her lord apart, or whether to imprint, At once, his hands with kisses and his brows. O'erpassing light the portal-step of stone She enter'd. He sat opposite, illumed By the hearth's sprightly blaze, and close before A pillar of the dome, waiting with eyes Downcast, till viewing him, his noble spouse Should speak to him; but she sat silent long, Her faculties in mute amazement held. By turns she rivetted her eyes on his, And, seeing him so foul attired, by turns She recognized him not; then spake her son Telemachus, and her silence thus reproved. My mother! ah my hapless and my most Obdurate mother! wherefore thus aloof Shunn'st thou my father, neither at his side Sitting affectionate, nor uttering word? Another wife lives not who could endure Such distance from her husband new-return'd To his own country in the twentieth year, After much hardship; but thy heart is still As ever, less impressible than stone. To whom Penelope discrete replied. I am all wonder, O my son! my soul Is stunn'd within me; power to speak to him Or to interrogate him have I none, Or even to look on him; but if indeed He be Ulysses, and have reach'd his home, I shall believe it soon, by proof convinced Of signs, known only to himself and me. She said; then smiled the Hero toil-inured, And in wing'd accents thus spake to his son. Leave thou, Telemachus, thy mother here To sift and prove me; she will know me soon More certainly; she sees me ill-attired And squalid now; therefore she shews me scorn, And no belief hath yet that I am he. But we have need, thou and myself, of deep Deliberation. If a man have slain One only citizen, who leaves behind Few interested to avenge his death, Yet flying he forsakes both friends and home; But we have slain the noblest Princes far Of Ithaca, on whom our city most Depended; therefore, I advise thee, think! Him, prudent, then answer'd Telemachus. Be that thy care, my father! for report Proclaims thee shrewdest of mankind, with whom In ingenuity may none compare. Lead thou; to follow thee shall be our part With prompt alacrity; nor shall, I judge, Courage be wanting to our utmost force. Thus then replied Ulysses, ever-wise. To me the safest counsel and the best Seems this. First wash yourselves, and put ye on Your tunics; bid ye next the maidens take Their best attire, and let the bard divine Harping melodious play a sportive dance, That whether passenger or neighbour hear, All may imagine nuptials held within. So shall not loud report that we have slain All those, alarm the city till we gain Our woods and fields, where once arrived, such plans We will devise, as Jove shall deign to inspire. He spake, and all obedient in the bath First laved themselves, then put their tunics on; The damsels also dress'd, and the sweet bard Harping melodious, kindled strong desire In all of jocund song and graceful dance. The palace under all its vaulted roof Remurmur'd to the feet of sportive youths And cinctured maidens, while no few abroad, Hearing such revelry within remark'd;— The Queen with many wooers, weds at last. Ah fickle and unworthy fair! too frail Always to keep inviolate the house Of her first Lord, and wait for his return. So spake the people; but they little knew What had befallen. Eurynome, meantime, With bath and unction served the illustrious Chief Ulysses, and he saw himself attired Royally once again in his own house. Then Pallas over all his features shed Superior beauty, dignified his form With added amplitude, and pour'd his curls Like hyacinthine flowers down from his brows. As when some artist by Minerva made And Vulcan, wise to execute all tasks Ingenious, borders silver with a wreath Of gold, accomplishing a graceful work, Such grace the Goddess o'er his ample chest Copious diffused, and o'er his manly brows. He, godlike, stepping from the bath, resumed His former seat magnificent, and sat Opposite to the Queen, to whom he said. Penelope! the Gods to thee have given Of all thy sex, the most obdurate heart. Another wife lives not who could endure Such distance from her husband new-return'd To his own country in the twentieth year, After such hardship. But prepare me, nurse, A bed, for solitary I must sleep, Since she is iron, and feels not for me. Him, answer'd then prudent Penelope. I neither magnify thee, sir! nor yet Depreciate thee, nor is my wonder such As hurries me at once into thy arms, Though my remembrance perfectly retains, Such as he was, Ulysses, when he sail'd On board his bark from Ithaca—Go, nurse, Prepare his bed, but not within the walls Of his own chamber built with his own hands. Spread it without, and spread it well with warm Mantles, with fleeces, and with richest rugs. So spake she, The proof consisted in this—that the bed being attached to the stump of an olive tree still rooted, was immoveable, and Ulysses having made it himself, no person present, he must needs be apprized of the impossibility of her orders, if he were indeed Ulysses; accordingly, this demonstration of his identity satisfies all her scruples. proving him, and, not untouch'd With anger at that word, thus he replied. Penelope, that order grates my ear. Who hath displaced my bed? The task were hard Even to an artist; other than a God None might with ease remove it; as for man, It might defy the stoutest in his prime Of youth, to heave it to a different spot. For in that bed elaborate, a sign, A special sign consists; I was myself The artificer; I fashion'd it alone. Within the court a leafy olive grew Lofty, luxuriant, pillar-like in girth. Around this tree I built, with massy stones Cemented close, my chamber, roof'd it o'er, And hung the glutinated portals on. I lopp'd the ample foliage and the boughs, And severing near the root its solid bole, Smooth'd all the rugged stump with skilful hand, And wrought it to a pedestal well squared And modell'd by the line. I wimbled, next, The frame throughout, and from the olive-stump Beginning, fashion'd the whole bed above Till all was finish'd, plated o'er with gold, With silver, and with ivory, and beneath Close interlaced with purple cordage strong. Such sign I give thee. But if still it stand Unmoved, or if some other, severing sheer The olive from its bottom, have displaced My bed—that matter is best known to thee. He ceased; she, conscious of the sign so plain Given by Ulysses, heard with fluttering heart And faultering knees that proof. Weeping she ran Direct toward him, threw her arms around The Hero, kiss'd his forehead, and replied. Ah my Ulysses! pardon me—frown not— Thou who at other times hast ever shown Superior wisdom! all our griefs have flow'd From the Gods' will; they envied us the bliss Of undivided union sweet enjoy'd Through life, from early youth to latest age. No. Be not angry now; pardon the fault That I embraced thee not as soon as seen, For horror hath not ceased to overwhelm My soul, lest some false alien should, perchance, Beguile me, for our house draws numerous such. Jove's daughter, Argive Helen, ne'er had given Free entertainment to a stranger's love, Had she foreknown that the heroic sons Of Greece would bring her to her home again. But heaven incited her to that offence, Who never, else, had even in her thought Harbour'd the foul enormity, from which Originated even our distress. But now, since evident thou hast described Our bed, which never mortal yet beheld, Ourselves except and Actoris my own Attendant, given me when I left my home By good Icarius, and who kept the door, Though hard to be convinced, at last I yield. So saying, she awaken'd in his soul Pity and grief; and folding in his arms His blameless consort beautiful, he wept. Welcome as land appears to those who swim, Whose gallant bark Neptune with rolling waves And stormy winds hath sunk in the wide sea, A mariner or two, perchance, escape The foamy flood, and swimming reach the land, Weary indeed, and with incrusted brine All rough, but oh, how glad to climb the coast! So welcome in her eyes Ulysses seem'd, Around whose neck winding her snowy arms, She clung as she would loose him never more. Thus had they wept till rosy-finger'd morn Had found them weeping, but Minerva check'd Night's almost finish'd course, and held, meantime, The golden dawn close prisoner in the Deep, Forbidding her to lead her coursers forth, Lampus and Phaëthon that furnish light To all the earth, and join them to the yoke. Then thus, Ulysses to Penelope. My love! we have not yet attain'd the close Of all our sufferings, but unmeasured toil Arduous remains, which I must still atchieve. For so the spirit of the Theban seer Inform'd me, on that day, when to enquire Of mine and of my people's safe return I journey'd down to Pluto's drear abode. But let us hence to bed, there to enjoy Tranquil repose. My love, make no delay. Him answer'd then prudent Penelope. Thou shalt to bed at whatsoever time Thy soul desires, since the immortal Gods Give thee to me and to thy home again. But, thou hast spoken from the seer of Thebes Of arduous toils yet unperform'd; declare What toils? Thou wilt disclose them, as I judge, Hereafter, and why not disclose them now? To whom Ulysses, ever wise, replied. Ah conversant with woe! why would'st thou learn That tale? but I will tell it thee at large. Thou wilt not hear with joy, nor shall myself With joy rehearse it; for he bade me seek City after city, bearing, as I go, A shapely oar, till I shall find, at length, A people who the sea know not, nor eat Food salted; they trim galley crimson-prow'd Have ne'er beheld, nor yet smooth shaven oar With which the vessel wing'd scuds o'er the waves. He gave me also this authentic sign, Which I will tell thee. In what place soe'er I chance to meet a traveller who shall name The oar on my broad shoulder borne, a van See the note on the same passage, Book XI.; He bade me, planting it on that same spot, Worship the King of Ocean with a bull, A ram, and a lascivious boar, then seek My home again, and sacrifice at home An hecatomb to the immortal Gods Inhabitants of the expanse above. So shall I die, at length, the gentlest death Remote from Ocean; it shall find me late, In soft serenity of age, the Chief Of a blest people.—Thus he prophesied. Him answer'd then Penelope discrete. If heaven appoint thee in old age a lot More tranquil, hope thence springs of thy escape Some future day from all thy threaten'd woes. Such was their mutual conference sweet; meantime Eurynome and Euryclea dress'd Their bed by light of the clear torch, and when Dispatchful they had spread it broad and deep, The ancient nurse to her own bed retired. Then came Eurynome, to whom in trust The chambers appertain'd, and with a torch Conducted them to rest; she introduced The happy pair, and went; transported they To rites connubial intermitted long, And now recover'd gave themselves again Aristophanes the grammarian and Aristarchus chose that the Odyssey should end here; but the story is not properly concluded till the tumult occasioned by the slaughter of so many Princes being composed, Ulysses finds himself once more in peaceable possession of his country.. Meantime, the Prince, the herdsman, and the good Eumæus giving rest each to his feet, Ceased from the dance; they made the women cease Also, and to their several chambers all Within the twilight edifice repair'd. At length with conjugal endearment both Satiate, Ulysses tasted and his spouse The sweets of mutual converse. She rehearsed, Noblest of women, all her numerous woes Beneath that roof sustain'd, while she beheld The profligacy of the suitor-throng, Who in their wooing had consumed his herds And fatted flocks, and drawn his vessels dry; While brave Ulysses, in his turn, to her Related his successes and escapes, And his afflictions also; he told her all; She listen'd charm'd, nor slumber on his eyes Fell once, or ere he had rehearsed the whole. Beginning, he discoursed, how at the first He conquer'd in Ciconia, and thence reach'd The fruitful shores of the Lotophagi; The Cyclops' deeds he told her next, and how He well avenged on him his slaughter'd friends Whom, pitiless, the monster had devour'd. How to the isle of Æolus he came, Who welcomed him and safe dismiss'd him thence, Although not destined to regain so soon His native land; for o'er the fishy deep Loud tempests snatch'd him sighing back again. How, also at Telepylus he arrived, Town of the Læstrygonians, who destroy'd His ships with all their mariners, his own Except, who in his sable bark escaped. Of guileful Circe too he spake, deep-skill'd In various artifice, and how he reach'd With sails and oars the squalid realms of death, Desirous to consult the prophet there Theban Tiresias, and how there he view'd All his companions, and the mother bland Who bare him, nourisher of his infant years. How next he heard the Sirens in one strain All chiming sweet, and how he reach'd the rocks Erratic, Scylla and Charybdis dire, Which none secure from injury may pass. Then how the partners of his voyage slew The Sun's own beeves, and how the Thunderer Jove Hurl'd down his smoky bolts into his bark, Depriving him at once of all his crew, Whose dreadful fate, he yet himself escaped. How to Ogygia's isle he came, where dwelt The nymph Calypso, who enamour'd wish'd To espouse him, and within her spacious grot Detain'd, and fed, and promised him a life Exempt for ever from the sap of age, But him moved not. How also he arrived After much toil, on the Phæacian coast, Where every heart revered him as a God, And whence, enriching him with brass and gold, And costly raiment first, they sent him home. At this last word, oblivious slumber sweet Fell on him, dissipating all his cares. Meantime, Minerva, Goddess azure-eyed, On other thoughts intent, soon as she deem'd Ulysses with connubial joys sufficed, And with sweet sleep, at once from Ocean roused The golden-axled chariot of the morn To illumine earth. Then from his fleecy couch The Hero sprang, and thus his spouse enjoin'd. Oh consort dear! already we have striven Against our lot till wearied with the toil, My painful absence, thou with ceaseless tears Deploring, and myself in deep distress Withheld reluctant from my native shores By Jove and by the other powers of heaven. But since we have in this delightful bed Met once again, watch thou and keep secure All my domestic treasures, and ere long I will replace my numerous sheep destroy'd By those imperious suitors, and the Greeks Shall add yet others till my folds be fill'd. But to the woodlands go I now—to see My noble father, who for my sake mourns Continual; as for thee, my love, although I know thee wise, I give thee thus in charge. The sun no sooner shall ascend, than fame Shall wide divulge the deed that I have done, Slaying the suitors under my own roof. Thou, therefore, with thy maidens sit retired In thy own chamber at the palace-top, Nor question ask, nor curious look abroad. He said, and covering with his radiant arms His shoulders, call'd Telemachus; he roused Eumæus and the herdsman too, and bade All take their martial weapons in their hands. Not disobedient they, as he enjoin'd, Put armour on, and issued from the gates Ulysses at their head. The earth was now Enlighten'd, but Minerva them in haste Led forth into the fields, unseen by all. BOOK XXIV. ARGUMENT OF THE TWENTY-FOURTH BOOK. Mercury conducts the souls of the suitors down to Ades. Ulysses discovers himself to Laertes, and quells, by the aid of Minerva, an insurrection of the people resenting the death of the suitors. And now Cyllenian Hermes summon'd forth The spirits of the suitors; waving wide The golden wand of power to seal all eyes In slumber, and to ope them wide again, He drove them gibbering ?????????—?????????? ? ? the ghosts Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets. Shaksp. down into the shades. As when the bats within some hallow'd cave Flit squeaking all around, for if but one Fall from the rock, the rest all follow him, In such connexion mutual they adhere; So, after bounteous Mercury, the ghosts Troop'd downward gibbering all the dreary way. The Ocean's flood and the Leucadian rock, The Sun's gate also and the land of Dreams They pass'd, whence next into the meads they came Of Asphodel, by shadowy forms possess'd, Simulars of the dead. They found the souls Of brave Pelides there, and of his friend Patroclus, of Antilochus renown'd, And of the mightier Ajax, for his form And bulk, (Achilles sole except,) of all The sons of the Achaians most admired. These waited on Achilles. Then appear'd The mournful ghost of Agamemnon, son Of Atreus, compass'd by the ghosts of all Who shared his fate beneath Ægisthus' roof, And him the ghost of Peleus' son bespake. Atrides! of all Heroes we esteem'd Thee dearest to the Gods, for that thy sway Extended over such a glorious host At Ilium, scene of sorrow to the Greeks. But Fate, whose ruthless force none may escape Of all who breathe, pursued thee from the first. Thou shouldst have perish'd full of honour, full Of royalty, at Troy; so all the Greeks Had raised thy tomb, and thou hadst then bequeath'd Great glory to thy son; but Fate ordain'd A death, oh how deplorable! for thee. To whom Atrides' spirit thus replied. Blest son of Peleus, semblance of the Gods, At Ilium, far from Argos, fallen! for whom Contending, many a Trojan, many a Chief Of Greece died also, while in eddies whelm'd Of dust thy vastness ? Behemoth, biggest born of earth, Upheaved his vastness. Milton. spread the plain, nor thee The chariot aught or steed could interest more! All day we waged the battle, nor at last Desisted, but for tempests sent from Jove. At length, we bore into the Greecian fleet Thy body from the field; there first we cleansed With tepid baths, and oil'd thy shapely corse, Then placed thee on thy bier, while many a Greek Around thee wept, and shore his locks for thee. Thy mother also, hearing of thy death, With her immortal nymphs from the abyss Arose and came; terrible was the sound On the salt flood; a panic seized the Greeks, And every warrior had return'd on board That moment, had not Nestor, antient Chief, Illumed by long experience, interposed; His counsels, ever wisest, wisest proved Then also, and he thus address'd the host. Sons of Achaia, fly not; stay, ye Greeks! Thetis arrives with her immortal nymphs From the abyss, to visit her dead son. So he; and, by his admonition stay'd, The Greeks fled not. Then all around thee stood The daughters of the Antient of the Deep, Mourning disconsolate; with heavenly robes They clothed thy corse, and all the Muses nine Deplored thee in full choir with sweetest tones Responsive, nor one Greecian hadst thou seen Dry-eyed, such grief the Muses moved in all. Full seventeen days we day and night deplored Thy death, both Gods in heaven and men below; But on the eighteenth day, we gave thy corse Its burning, and fat sheep around thee slew Numerous, with many a pastured ox moon-horn'd. We burn'd thee clothed in vesture of the Gods, With honey and with oil feeding the flames Abundant, while Achaia's Heroes arm'd, Both horse and foot, encompassing thy pile, Clash'd on their shields, and deafening was the din. But when the fires of Vulcan had at length Consumed thee, at the dawn we stored thy bones In unguent and in undiluted wine; For Thetis gave to us a golden vase Twin-ear'd, which she profess'd to have received From Bacchus, work divine of Vulcan's hand. Within that vase, Achilles, treasured lie Thine and the bones of thy departed friend Patroclus, but a separate urn we gave To those of brave Antilochus, who most Of all thy friends at Ilium shared thy love And thy respect, thy friend Patroclus slain. Around both urns we piled a noble tomb, (We warriors of the sacred Argive host) On a tall promontory shooting far Into the spacious Hellespont, that all Who live, and who shall yet be born, may view Thy record, even from the distant waves. Then, by permission from the Gods obtain'd, To the Achaian Chiefs in circus met Thetis appointed games. I have beheld The burial rites of many a Hero bold, When on the death of some great Chief, the youths Girding their loins anticipate the prize, But sight of those with wonder fill'd me most, So glorious past all others were the games By silver-footed Thetis given for thee, For thou wast ever favour'd of the Gods. Thus hast thou not, Achilles! although dead, Forgone thy glory, but thy fair report Is universal among all mankind; But as for me, what recompense had I, My warfare closed? for whom, at my return, Jove framed such dire destruction by the hands Of fell Ægisthus and my murtheress wife. Thus mutual they conferr'd; meantime approach'd, Swift messenger of heaven, the Argicide, Conducting thither all the shades of those Slain by Ulysses. At that sight amazed Both moved toward them. Agamemnon's shade Knew well Amphimedon, for he had been Erewhile his father's guest in Ithaca, And thus the spirit of Atreus' son began. Amphimedon! by what disastrous chance, Coævals as ye seem, and of an air Distinguish'd all, descend ye to the Deeps? For not the chosen youths of a whole town Should form a nobler band. Perish'd ye sunk Amid vast billows and rude tempests raised By Neptune's power? or on dry land through force Of hostile multitudes, while cutting off Beeves from the herd, or driving flocks away? Or fighting for your city and your wives? Resolve me; I was once a guest of yours. Remember'st not what time at your abode With godlike Menelaus I arrived, That we might win Ulysses with his fleet To follow us to Troy? scarce we prevail'd At last to gain the city-waster Chief, And after all, consumed a whole month more The wide sea traversing from side to side. To whom the spirit of Amphimedon. Illustrious Agamemnon, King of men! All this I bear in mind, and will rehearse The manner of our most disastrous end. Believing brave Ulysses lost, we woo'd Meantime his wife; she our detested suit Would neither ratify nor yet refuse, But, planning for us a tremendous death, This novel stratagem, at last, devised. Beginning in her own recess, a web Of slenderest thread, and of a length and breadth Unusual, thus the suitors she address'd. Princes, my suitors! since the noble Chief Ulysses is no more, enforce not yet My nuptials; wait till I shall finish first A funeral robe (lest all my threads decay) Which for the antient Hero I prepare, Laertes, looking for the mournful hour When fate shall snatch him to eternal rest; Else I the censure dread of all my sex, Should he, so wealthy, want at last a shroud. So spake the Queen; we, unsuspicious all, With her request complied. Thenceforth, all day She wove the ample web, and by the aid Of torches ravell'd it again at night. Three years she thus by artifice our suit Eluded safe, but when the fourth arrived, And the same season, after many moons And fleeting days return'd, a damsel then Of her attendants, conscious of the fraud, Reveal'd it, and we found her pulling loose The splendid web. Thus through constraint, at length She finish'd it, and in her own despight. But when the Queen produced, at length, her work Finish'd, new-blanch'd, bright as the sun or moon, Then came Ulysses, by some adverse God Conducted to the cottage on the verge Of his own fields, in which his swine-herd dwells; There also the illustrious Hero's son Arrived soon after, in his sable bark From sandy Pylus borne; they plotting both A dreadful death for all the suitors, sought Our glorious city, but Ulysses last, And first Telemachus. The father came Conducted by his swine-herd, and attired In tatters foul; a mendicant he seem'd, Time-worn, and halted on a staff. So clad, And entering on the sudden, he escaped All knowledge even of our eldest there, And we reviled and smote him; he, although Beneath his own roof smitten and reproach'd, With patience suffer'd it awhile, but roused By inspiration of Jove ægis-arm'd At length, in concert with his son convey'd To his own chamber his resplendent arms, There lodged them safe, and barr'd the massy doors. Then, in his subtlety he bade the Queen A contest institute with bow and rings Between the hapless suitors, whence ensued Slaughter to all. No suitor there had power To overcome the stubborn bow that mock'd All our attempts; and when the weapon huge At length was offer'd to Ulysses' hands, With clamour'd menaces we bade the swain Withhold it from him, plead he as he might; Telemachus alone, with loud command, Bade give it him, and the illustrious Chief Receiving in his hand the bow, with ease Bent it, and sped a shaft through all the rings. Then springing to the portal steps, he pour'd The arrows forth, peer'd terrible around, Pierced King Antinoüs, and aiming sure His deadly darts, pierced others after him, Till in one common carnage heap'd we lay. Some God, as plain appear'd, vouchsafed them aid, Such ardour urged them, and with such dispatch They slew us on all sides; hideous were heard The groans of dying men fell'd to the earth With head-strokes rude, and the floor swam with blood. Such, royal Agamemnon! was the fate By which we perish'd, all whose bodies lie Unburied still, and in Ulysses' house, For tidings none hath yet our friends alarm'd And kindred, who might cleanse from sable gore Our clotted wounds, and mourn us on the bier, Which are the rightful privilege of the dead. Him answer'd, then, the shade of Atreus' son. Oh happy offspring of Laertes! shrewd Ulysses! matchless valour thou hast shewn Recovering thus thy wife; nor less appears The virtue of Icarius' daughter wise, The chaste Penelope, so faithful found To her Ulysses, husband of her youth. His glory, by superior merit earn'd, Shall never die, and the immortal Gods Shall make Penelope a theme of song Delightful in the ears of all mankind. Not such was Clytemnestra, daughter vile Of Tyndarus; she shed her husband's blood, And shall be chronicled in song a wife Of hateful memory, by whose offence Even the virtuous of her sex are shamed. Thus they, beneath the vaulted roof obscure Of Pluto's house, conferring mutual stood. Meantime, descending from the city-gates, Ulysses, by his son and by his swains Follow'd, arrived at the delightful farm Which old Laertes had with strenuous toil Himself long since acquired. There stood his house Encompass'd by a bower in which the hinds Who served and pleased him, ate, and sat, and slept. An ancient woman, a Sicilian, dwelt There also, who in that sequester'd spot Attended diligent her aged Lord. Then thus Ulysses to his followers spake. Haste now, and entering, slay ye of the swine The best for our regale; myself the while, Will prove my father, if his eye hath still Discernment of me, or if absence long Have worn the knowledge of me from his mind. He said, and gave into his servants' care His arms; they swift proceeded to the house, And to the fruitful grove himself as swift To prove his father. Down he went at once Into the spacious garden-plot, but found Nor Dolius there, nor any of his sons Or servants; they were occupied elsewhere, And with the ancient hind himself, employ'd Collecting thorns with which to fence the grove. In that umbrageous spot he found alone Laertes, with his hoe clearing a plant; Sordid his tunic was, with many a patch Mended unseemly; leathern were his greaves, Thong-tied and also patch'd, a frail defence Against sharp thorns, while gloves secured his hands From briar-points, and on his head he bore A goat-skin casque, nourishing hopeless woe. No sooner then the Hero toil-inured Saw him age-worn and wretched, than he paused Beneath a lofty pear-tree's shade to weep. There standing much he mused, whether, at once, Kissing and clasping in his arms his sire, To tell him all, by what means he had reach'd His native country, or to prove him first. At length he chose as his best course, with words Of seeming strangeness to accost his ear, And with that purpose, moved direct toward him. He stooping low, loosen'd the earth around A garden-plant, when his illustrious son Now standing close beside him, thus began. Old sir! thou art no novice in these toils Of culture, but thy garden thrives; I mark In all thy ground no plant, fig, olive, vine, Pear-tree or flower-bed suffering through neglect. But let it not offend thee if I say That thou neglect'st thyself, at the same time Oppress'd with age, sun-parch'd, and ill-attired. Not for thy inactivity, methinks, Thy master slights thee thus, nor speaks thy form Or thy surpassing stature servile aught In thee, but thou resemblest more a King. Yes—thou resemblest one who, bathed and fed, Should softly sleep; such is the claim of age. But tell me true—for whom labourest thou, And whose this garden? answer me beside, For I would learn; have I indeed arrived In Ithaca, as one whom here I met Even now assured me, but who seem'd a man Not overwise, refusing both to hear My questions, and to answer when I ask'd Concerning one in other days my guest And friend, if he have still his being here, Or have deceased and journey'd to the shades? For I will tell thee; therefore mark. Long since A stranger reach'd my house in my own land, Whom I with hospitality received, Nor ever sojourn'd foreigner with me Whom I loved more. He was by birth, he said, Ithacan, and Laertes claim'd his sire, Son of Arcesias. Introducing him Beneath my roof, I entertain'd him well, And proved by gifts his welcome at my board. I gave him seven talents of wrought gold, A goblet, argent all, with flowers emboss'd, Twelve single cloaks, twelve carpets, mantles twelve Of brightest lustre, with as many vests, And added four fair damsels, whom he chose Himself, well born and well accomplish'd all. Then thus his ancient sire weeping replied. Stranger! thou hast in truth attain'd the isle Of thy enquiry, but it is possess'd By a rude race, and lawless. Vain, alas! Were all thy numerous gifts; yet hadst thou found Him living here in Ithaca, with gifts Reciprocated he had sent thee hence, Requiting honourably in his turn Thy hospitality. But give me quick Answer, and true. How many have been the years Since thy reception of that hapless guest My son? for mine, my own dear son was he. But him, far distant both from friends and home, Either the fishes of the unknown Deep Have eaten, or wild beasts and fowls of prey, Nor I, or she who bare him, was ordain'd To bathe his shrouded body with our tears, Nor his chaste wife, well-dower'd Penelope To close her husband's eyes, and to deplore His doom, which is the privilege of the dead. But tell me also thou, for I would learn, Who art thou? whence? where born? and sprung from whom? The bark in which thou and thy godlike friends Arrived, where is she anchor'd on our coast? Or camest thou only passenger on board Another's bark, who landed thee and went? To whom Ulysses, ever wise, replied. I will with all simplicity relate What thou hast ask'd. Of Alybas am I, Where in much state I dwell, son of the rich Apheidas, royal Polypemon's son, And I am named Eperitus; by storms Driven from Sicily I have arrived, And yonder, on the margin of the field That skirts your city, I have moor'd my bark. Five years have pass'd since thy Ulysses left, Unhappy Chief! my country; yet the birds At his departure hover'd on the right, And in that sign rejoicing, I dismiss'd Him thence rejoicing also, for we hoped To mix in social intercourse again, And to exchange once more pledges of love. He spake; then sorrow as a sable cloud Involved Laertes; gathering with both hands The dust, he pour'd it on his reverend head With many a piteous groan. Ulysses' heart Commotion felt, and his stretch'd nostrils throbb'd With agony close-pent, while fix'd he eyed His father; with a sudden force he sprang Toward him, clasp'd, and kiss'd him, and exclaim'd. My father! I am he. Thou seest thy son Absent these twenty years at last return'd. But bid thy sorrows cease; suspend henceforth All lamentation; for I tell thee true, (And the occasion bids me briefly tell thee) I have slain all the suitors at my home, And all their taunts and injuries avenged. Then answer thus Laertes quick return'd. If thou hast come again, and art indeed My son Ulysses, give me then the proof Indubitable, that I may believe. To whom Ulysses, ever wise, replied. View, first, the scar which with his ivory tusk A wild boar gave me, when at thy command And at my mother's, to Autolycus Her father, on Parnassus, I repair'd Seeking the gifts which, while a guest of yours, He promised should be mine. Accept beside This proof. I will enumerate all the trees Which, walking with thee in this cultured spot (Boy then) I begg'd, and thou confirm'dst my own. We paced between them, and thou madest me learn The name of each. Thou gavest me thirteen pears The fruit is here used for the tree that bore it, as it is in the Greek; the Latins used the same mode of expression, neither is it uncommon in our own language., Ten apples The fruit is here used for the tree that bore it, as it is in the Greek; the Latins used the same mode of expression, neither is it uncommon in our own language., thirty figs The fruit is here used for the tree that bore it, as it is in the Greek; the Latins used the same mode of expression, neither is it uncommon in our own language., and fifty ranks Did promise me of vines, their alleys all Corn-cropp'd between. There oft as sent from Jove The influences of the year descend, Grapes of all hues and flavours clustering hang. He said; Laertes conscious of the proofs Indubitable by Ulysses given, With faultering knees and faultering heart both arms Around him threw. The Hero toil-inured Drew to his bosom close his fainting sire, Who, breath recovering, and his scatter'd powers Of intellect, at length thus spake aloud. Ye Gods! oh then your residence is still On the Olympian heights, if punishment At last hath seized on those flagitious men. But terrour shakes me, lest, incensed, ere long All Ithaca flock hither, and dispatch Swift messengers with these dread tidings charged To every Cephallenian state around. Him answer'd then Ulysses ever wise. Courage! fear nought, but let us to the house Beside the garden, whither I have sent Telemachus, the herdsman, and the good Eumæus to prepare us quick repast. So they conferr'd, and to Laertes' house Pass'd on together; there arrived, they found Those three preparing now their plenteous feast, And mingling sable wine; then, by the hands Of his Sicilian matron, the old King Was bathed, anointed, and attired afresh, And Pallas, drawing nigh, dilated more His limbs, and gave his whole majestic form Encrease of amplitude. He left the bath. His son, amazed as he had seen a God Alighted newly from the skies, exclaim'd. My father! doubtless some immortal Power Hath clothed thy form with dignity divine. Then thus replied his venerable sire. Jove! Pallas! Phœbus! oh that I possess'd Such vigour now, as when in arms I took Nericus, continental city fair, With my brave Cephallenians! oh that such And arm'd as then, I yesterday had stood Beside thee in thy palace, combating Those suitors proud, then had I strew'd the floor With numerous slain, to thy exceeding joy. Such was their conference; and now, the task Of preparation ended, and the feast Set forth, on couches and on thrones they sat, And ranged in order due, took each his share. Then ancient Dolius, and with him, his sons Arrived toil-worn, by the Sicilian dame Summon'd, their cateress, and their father's kind Attendant ever in his eve of life. They, seeing and recalling soon to mind Ulysses, in the middle mansion stood Wondering, when thus Ulysses with a voice Of some reproof, but gentle, them bespake. Old servant, sit and eat, banishing fear And mute amazement; for, although provoked By appetite, we have long time abstain'd, Expecting every moment thy return. He said; then Dolius with expanded arms Sprang right toward Ulysses, seized his hand, Kiss'd it, and in wing'd accents thus replied. Oh master ever dear! since thee the Gods Themselves, in answer to our warm desires, Have, unexpectedly, at length restored, Hail, and be happy, and heaven make thee such! But say, and truly; knows the prudent Queen Already thy return, or shall we send Ourselves an herald with the joyful news? To whom Ulysses, ever wise, replied. My ancient friend, thou may'st release thy mind From that solicitude; she knows it well. So he; then Dolius to his glossy seat Return'd, and all his sons gathering around Ulysses, welcomed him and grasp'd his hand, Then sat beside their father; thus beneath Laertes' roof they, joyful, took repast. But Fame with rapid haste the city roam'd In every part, promulging in all ears The suitors' horrid fate. No sooner heard The multitude that tale, than one and all Groaning they met and murmuring before Ulysses' gates. Bringing the bodies forth, They buried each his friend, but gave the dead Of other cities to be ferried home By fishermen on board their rapid barks. All hasted then to council; sorrow wrung Their hearts, and, the assembly now convened, Arising first Eupithes spake, for grief Sat heavy on his soul, grief for the loss Of his Antinoüs by Ulysses slain Foremost of all, whom mourning, thus he said. My friends! no trivial fruits the Greecians reap Of this man's doings. Those he took with him On board his barks, a numerous train and bold, Then lost his barks, lost all his numerous train, And these, our noblest, slew at his return. Come therefore—ere he yet escape by flight To Pylus or to noble Elis, realm Of the Epeans, follow him; else shame Attends us and indelible reproach. If we avenge not on these men the blood Of our own sons and brothers, farewell then All that makes life desirable; my wish Henceforth shall be to mingle with the shades. Oh then pursue and seize them ere they fly. Thus he with tears, and pity moved in all. Then, Medon and the sacred bard whom sleep Had lately left, arriving from the house Of Laertiades, approach'd; amid The throng they stood; all wonder'd seeing them, And Medon, prudent senior, thus began. Hear me, my countrymen! Ulysses plann'd With no disapprobation of the Gods The deed that ye deplore. I saw, myself, A Power immortal at the Hero's side, In semblance just of Mentor; now the God, In front apparent, led him on, and now, From side to side of all the palace, urged To flight the suitors; heaps on heaps they fell. He said; then terrour wan seized every cheek And Halitherses, Hero old, the son Of Mastor, who alone among them all Knew past and future, prudent, thus began. Now, O ye men of Ithaca! my words Attentive hear! by your own fault, my friends, This deed hath been perform'd; for when myself And noble Mentor counsell'd you to check The sin and folly of your sons, ye would not. Great was their wickedness, and flagrant wrong They wrought, the wealth devouring, and the wife Dishonouring of an illustrious Chief Whom they deem'd destined never to return. But hear my counsel. Go not, lest ye draw Disaster down and woe on your own heads. He ended; then with boisterous roar (although Part kept their seats) upsprang the multitude, For Halitherses pleased them not, they chose Eupithes' counsel rather; all at once To arms they flew, and clad in dazzling brass, Before the city form'd their dense array. Leader infatuate, at their head appear'd Eupithes, hoping to avenge his son Antinoüs, but was himself ordain'd To meet his doom, and to return no more. Then thus Minerva to Saturnian Jove. Oh father! son of Saturn! Jove supreme! Declare the purpose hidden in thy breast. Wilt thou that this hostility proceed, Or wilt thou grant them amity again? To whom the cloud-assembler God replied. Why asks my daughter? didst thou not design Thyself, that brave Ulysses coming home Should slay those profligates? act as thou wilt, But thus I counsel. Since the noble Chief Hath slain the suitors, now let peace ensue Oath-bound, and reign Ulysses evermore! The slaughter of their brethren and their sons To strike from their remembrance, shall be ours. Let mutual amity, as at the first, Unite them, and let wealth and peace abound. So saying, he animated to her task Minerva prompt before, and from the heights Olympian down to Ithaca she flew. Meantime Ulysses (for their hunger now And thirst were sated) thus address'd his hinds. Look ye abroad, lest haply they approach. He said, and at his word, forth went a son Of Dolius; at the gate he stood, and thence Beholding all that multitude at hand, In accents wing'd thus to Ulysses spake. They come—they are already arrived—arm all! Then, all arising, put their armour on, Ulysses with his three, and the six sons Of Dolius; Dolius also with the rest Arm'd and Laertes, although silver-hair'd, Warriors perforce. When all were clad alike In radiant armour, throwing wide the gates They sallied, and Ulysses led the way. Then Jove's own daughter Pallas, in the form And with the voice of Mentor, came in view, Whom seeing Laertiades rejoiced, And thus Telemachus, his son, bespake. Now, oh my son! thou shalt observe, untold By me, where fight the bravest. Oh shame not Thine ancestry, who have in all the earth Proof given of valour in all ages past. To whom Telemachus, discrete, replied. My father! if thou wish that spectacle, Thou shalt behold thy son as thou hast said, In nought dishonouring his noble race. Then was Laertes joyful, and exclaim'd, What sun hath risen to day ??? ?? ??? ????? ???;—So Cicero, who seems to translate it—Proh dii immortales! Quis hic illuxit dies!See Clarke in loco.? oh blessed Gods! My son and grandson emulous dispute The prize of glory, and my soul exults. He ended, and Minerva, drawing nigh To the old King, thus counsell'd him. Oh friend Whom most I love, son of Arcesias; prayer Preferring to the virgin azure-eyed, And to her father Jove, delay not, shake Thy lance in air, and give it instant flight. So saying, the Goddess nerved his arm anew. He sought in prayer the daughter dread of Jove, And brandishing it, hurl'd his lance; it struck Eupithes, pierced his helmet brazen-cheek'd That stay'd it not, but forth it sprang beyond, And with loud clangor of his arms he fell. Then flew Ulysses and his noble son With faulchion and with spear of double edge To the assault, and of them all had left None living, none had to his home return'd, But that Jove's virgin daughter with a voice Of loud authority thus quell'd them all. Peace, O ye men of Ithaca! while yet The field remains undeluged with your blood. So she, and fear at once paled every cheek. All trembled at the voice divine; their arms Escaping from the grasp fell to the earth, And covetous of longer life, each fled Back to the city. Then Ulysses sent His voice abroad, and with an eagle's force Sprang on the people; but Saturnian Jove Cast down, incontinent, his smouldering bolt At Pallas feet, and thus the Goddess spake. Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd! Forbear; abstain from slaughter; lest thyself Incur the anger of high-thundering Jove. So Pallas, whom Ulysses glad obey'd. Then faithful covenants of peace between Both sides ensued, ratified in the sight Of Pallas, progeny of Jove, who seem'd In voice and form, the Mentor known to all. THE BATTLE OF THE FROGS AND MICE. TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH BLANK VERSE BY THE SAME HAND. Descend all Helicon into my breast! Oh every virgin of the tuneful choir Breathe on my song which I have newly traced In tables open'd on my knees, a song Of bloodiest note—terrible deeds of Mars Well worthy of the ears of all mankind, Whom I desire to teach, how, erst, the Mice Assail'd the Frogs, mimicking in exploit The prowess of the giant race earth-born. The rumour once was frequent in the mouths Of mortal men, and thus the strife began. A thirsty Mouse (thirsty with fear and flight From a cat's claws) sought out the nearest lake, Where dipping in the flood his downy chin, He drank delighted. Him the frog far-famed Limnocharis The beauty of the lake. espied, and thus he spake. Who art thou, stranger? Whence hast thou arrived On this our border, and who gave thee birth? Beware thou trespass not against the truth; Lie not! for should I find thy merit such As claims my love, I will conduct thee hence To my abode, where gifts thou shalt receive Liberal and large, with hospitable fare. I am the King Physignathus The pouter., revered By the inhabitants of all this pool, Chief of the frogs for ever. Me, long since, Peleus Of or belonging to mud. begat, embracing on the banks Of the Eridanus my mother fair, Hydromedusa Governess of the waters.. Nor thee less than King Or leader bold in fight thy form proclaims, Stout as it is, and beautiful.—Dispatch— Speak therefore, and declare thy pedigree. He ceased, to whom Psycharpax The crumb-catcher. thus replied. Illustrious sir! wherefore hast thou enquired My derivation, known to all, alike To Gods and men, and to the fowls of heaven? I am Psycharpax, and the dauntless Chief Troxartes The bread eater. is my sire, whose beauteous spouse Daughter of Pternotroctes The bacon-eater. brought me forth, Lichomyle The licker of mill-stones. by name. A cave of earth My cradle was, and, in my youngling state, My mother nourish'd me with almonds, figs, And delicacies of a thousand names. But diverse as our natures are, in nought Similar, how alas! can we be friends? The floods are thine abode, while I partake With man his sustenance. The basket stored With wheaten loaves thrice kneaded, 'scapes not me, Nor wafer broad, enrich'd with balmy sweets, Nor ham in slices spread, nor liver wrapt In tunic silver-white, nor curds express'd From sweetest milk, nor, sweeter still, the full Honeycomb, coveted by Kings themselves, Nor aught by skilful cook invented yet Of sauce or seasoning for delight of man. I am brave also, and shrink not at sound Of glorious war, but rushing to the van, Mix with the foremost combatants. No fear Of man himself shakes me, vast as he is, But to his bed I steal, and make me sport Nibbling his fingers' end, or with sharp tooth Fretting his heel so neatly that he sleeps Profound the while, unconscious of the bite. Two things, of all that are, appal me most, The owl and cat. These cause me many a pang. As does the hollow gin insidious, fair In promises, but in performance foul, Engine of death! yet most of all I dread Cats, nimble mousers, who can dart a paw After me, enter at what chink I may. But to return—your diet, parsley, kail, Beet, radish, gourd, (for, as I understand, Ye eat no other) are not to my taste. Him then with smiles answer'd Physignathus. Stranger! thou vauntest much thy dainty fare, But, both on shore and in the lake we boast Our dainties also, and such sights as much Would move thy wonder; for by gift from Jove We leap as well as swim, can range the land For food, or diving, seek it in the Deep. Would'st thou the proof? 'tis easy—mount my back— There cling as for thy life, and thou shalt share With rapture the delights of my abode. He said, and gave his back. Upsprang the mouse Lightly, and with his arms enfolded fast The Frog's soft neck. Pleased was he, at the first, With view of many a creek and bay, nor less With his smooth swimming on whose back he rode. But when, at length, the clear wave dash'd his sides, Then, fill'd with penitential sorrows vain He wept, pluck'd off his hair, and gathering close His hinder feet, survey'd with trembling heart The novel sight, and wish'd for land again. Groans follow'd next, extorted groans, through stress Of shivering fear, and, with extended tail Drawn like a long oar after him, he pray'd For land again; but, while he pray'd, again The clear wave dash'd him. Much he shriek'd, and much He clamour'd, and, at length thus sorrowing, said. Oh desperate navigation strange! not thus Europa floated to the shores of Crete On the broad back of her enamour'd bull. And now, dread spectacle to both, behold An Hydra! on the lake with crest erect He rode, and right toward them. At that sight Down went Physignathus, heedless alas! Through fear, how great a Prince he should destroy. Himself, at bottom of the pool escaped The dreadful death; but, at his first descent Dislodged, Psycharpax fell into the flood. There, stretch'd supine, he clench'd his hands, he shriek'd, Plunged oft, and lashing out his heels afar, Oft rose again, but no deliverance found. At length, oppress'd by his drench'd coat, and soon To sink for ever, thus he prophecied. Thou hast released thy shoulders at my cost, Physignathus! unfeeling as the rock, But not unnoticed by the Gods above. Ah worst of traitors! on dry land, I ween, Thou hadst not foil'd me, whether in the race Or wrestling-match, or at whatever game. Thou hast by fraud prevail'd, casting me off Into the waters; but an eye divine Sees all. Nor hope thou to escape the host Of Mice, who shall, ere long, avenge the deed. So saying, he sank and died; whom, while he sat Reposing on the lake's soft verge, the Mouse Lichopinax The dish-licker. observed; aloud he wail'd, And flew with those sad tidings to his friends. Grief, at the sound, immeasurable seized On all, and by command, at dawn of day The heralds call'd a council at the house Of brave Troxartes, father of the Prince Now lost, a carcase now, nor nigh to land Weltering, but distant in the middle pool. The multitude in haste convened, uprose Troxartes for his son incensed, and said, Ah friends! although my damage from the Frogs Sustain'd be greatest, yet is yours not small. Three children I have lost, wretch that I am, All sons. A merciless and hungry cat Finding mine eldest son abroad, surprised And slew him. Lured into a wooden snare, (New machination of unfeeling man For slaughter of our race, and named a trap) My second died. And now, as ye have heard, My third, his mother's and my darling, him Physignathus hath drown'd in yon abyss. Haste therefore, and in gallant armour bright Attired, march forth, ye Mice, now seek the foe. So saying, he roused them to the fight, and Mars Attendant arm'd them. Splitting first the pods Of beans which they had sever'd from the stalk With hasty tooth by night, they made them greaves. Their corslets were of platted straw, well lined With spoils of an excoriated cat. The lamp contributed its central tin, A shield for each. The glittering needle long Arm'd every gripe with a terrific spear, And auburn shells of nuts their brows enclosed. Thus arm'd the Mice advanced, of whose approach The Frogs apprized, emerging from the lake, All throng'd to council, and considering sat The sudden tumult and its cause. Then came, Sceptre in hand, an herald. Son was he Of the renown'd Tyroglyphus A cheese-rasper., and call'd Embasichytrus The explorer of pots and pipkins.. Charged he came to announce The horrors of approaching war, and said— Ye Frogs! the host of Mice send you by me Menaces and defiance. Arm, they say, For furious fight; for they have seen the Prince Psycharpax weltering on the waves, and drown'd By King Physignathus. Ye then, the Chiefs And leaders of the host of Frogs, put on Your armour, and draw forth your bands to battle! He said, and went. Then were the noble Frogs Troubled at that bold message, and while all Murmur'd against Physignathus, the King Himself arising, thus denied the charge. My friends! I neither drown'd the Mouse, nor saw His drowning. Doubtless, while he strove in sport To imitate the swimming of the Frogs, He sank and died. Thus, blame is none in me, And these injurious slanders do me wrong. Consult we, therefore, how we may destroy The subtle Mice, which thus we will perform. Arm'd and adorn'd for battle, we will wait Their coming where our coast is most abrupt. Then, soon as they shall rush to the assault, Seizing them by the helmet, as they come, We will precipitate them, arms and all, Into the lake; unskilful as they are To swim, their suffocation there is sure, And we will build a trophy to record The great Mouse-massacre for evermore. So saying, he gave commandment, and all arm'd. With leaves of mallows each his legs incased, Guarded his bosom with a corslet cut From the green beet, with foliage tough of kail Fashion'd his ample buckler, with a rush Keen-tipt, of length tremendous, fill'd his gripe, And on his brows set fast a cockle-shell. Then on the summit of the loftiest bank Drawn into phalanx firm they stood, all shook Their quivering spears, and wrath swell'd every breast. Jove saw them, and assembling all the Gods To council in the skies, Behold, he said, Yon numerous hosts, magnanimous, robust, And rough with spears, how like the giant race They move, or like the Centaurs! smiling, next, He ask'd, of all the Gods, who favour'd most The Mice, and who the Frogs? but at the last, Turning toward Minerva, thus he spake. The Mice, my daughter, need thee; goest thou not To aid thy friends the Mice, inmates of thine, Who to thy temple drawn by savoury steams Sacrifical, and day by day refresh'd With dainties there, dance on thy sacred floor? So spake the God, and Pallas thus replied. My father! suffer as they may, the Mice Shall have no aid from me, whom much they wrong, Marring my wreaths, and plundering of their oil My lamps.—But this, of all their impious deeds, Offends me most, that they have eaten holes In my best mantle, which with curious art Divine, I wove, light, easy, delicate; And now, the artificer whom I employ'd To mend it, clamouring demands a price Exorbitant, which moves me much to wrath, For I obtain'd on trust those costly threads, And have not wherewithal to pay the arrear. Nor love I more the Frogs, or purpose more To succour even them, since they not less, Dolts as they are, and destitute of thought, Have incommoded me. For when, of late, Returning from a fight weary and faint I needed rest, and would have slept, no sleep Found I, those ceaseless croakers of the lake Noisy, perverse, forbidding me a wink. Sleepless, and with an aching head I lay Therefore until the crowing of the cock. By my advice, then, O ye Gods, move not Nor interfere, favouring either side, Lest ye be wounded; for both hosts alike Are valiant, nor would scruple to assail Even ourselves. Suffice it, therefore, hence To view the battle, safe, and at our ease. She ceased, and all complied. Meantime, the hosts Drew nearer, and in front of each was seen An herald, gonfalon in hand; huge gnats Through clarions of unwieldy length sang forth The dreadful note of onset fierce, and Jove Doubled the signal, thundering from above. First, with his spear Hypsiboas The loud-croaker. assail'd Lichenor One addicted to licking.. Deep into his body rush'd The point, and pierced his liver. Prone he fell, And all his glossy down with dust defiled. Then, Troglodytes A creeper into holes and crannies. hurl'd his massy spear At Pelion Offspring of the mud., which he planted in his chest. Down dropp'd the Frog, night whelm'd him, and he died. Seutlæus A feeder on beet., through his heart piercing him, slew Embasichytrus. Polyphonus The noisy. fell Pierced through his belly by the spear of bold Artophagus The bread-eater., and prone in dust expired. Incensed at sight of Polyphonus slain, Limnocharis at Troglodytes cast A mill-stone weight of rock; full on the neck He batter'd him, and darkness veil'd his eyes. At him Lichenor hurl'd a glittering lance, Nor err'd, but pierced his liver. Trembling fled Crambophagus The cabbage eater. at that dread sight, and plunged Over the precipice into the lake, Yet even there found refuge none, for brave Lichenor following, smote him even there. So fell Crambophagus, and from that fall Never arose, but reddening with his blood The wave, and wallowing in the strings and slime Of his own vitals, near the bank expired. Limnisius Of the lake. on the grassy shore struck down Tyroglyphus The cheese-scraper.; but at the view alone Of terrible Pternoglyphus The ham-scraper. appall'd, Fled Calaminthius So call'd from the herb calamint., cast away his shield Afar, and headlong plunged into the lake. Hydrocharis One whose delight is in water. with a vast stone assail'd The King Pternophagus The bacon-eater.; the rugged mass Descending on his poll, crush'd it; the brain Oozed through his nostrils drop by drop, and all The bank around was spatter'd with his blood. Lichopinax with his long spear transpierced Borborocoites The sleeper in the mud.; darkness veil'd his eyes. Prassophagus The garlic-eater. with vengeful notice mark'd Cnissodioctes The savoury-steam-hunter.; seizing with one hand His foot, and with the other hand his neck, He plunged, and held him plunged, till drown'd he died. Psycharpax standing boldly in defence Of his slain fellow-warriors, urged his spear Right through Pelusius The muddy.; at his feet he fell, And, dying, mingled with the Frogs below. Resentful of his death, the mighty Frog Pelobates The mud-walker. an handful cast of mud Full at Psycharpax; all his ample front He smear'd, and left him scarce a glimpse of day. Psycharpax, at the foul dishonour, still Exasperate more, upheaving from the ground A rock that had incumber'd long the bank, Hurl'd it against Pelobates; below The knees he smote him, shiver'd his right leg In pieces, and outstretch'd him in the dust. But him Craugasides The hoarse-croaker., who stood to guard The fallen Chief, assail'd; with his long lance He prick'd Psycharpax at the waist! the whole Keen-pointed rush transpierced his belly, and all His bowels following the retracted point, O'erspread the ensanguined herbage at his side. Soon as Sitophagus The cake-eater., a crippled mouse, That sight beheld, limping, as best he could, He left the field, and, to avoid a fate Not less tremendous, dropp'd into a ditch. Troxartes grazed the instep of the bold Physignathus, who at the sudden pang Startled, at once leap'd down into the lake. Prasseus One who deals much in garlic., at the sight of such a Chief Floating in mortal agonies enraged, Sprang through his foremost warriors, and dismiss'd His pointed rush, but reach'd not through his shield Troxartes, baffled by the stubborn disk. There was a Mouse, young, beautiful and brave Past all on earth, son of the valiant Chief Artepibulus One who lies in wait for bread.. Like another Mars He fought, and Meridarpax The scrap-catcher. was his name, A Mouse, among all Mice without a peer. Glorying in his might on the lake's verge He stood with other Mouse none at his side, And swore to extirpate the whole croaking race. Nor doubted any but he should perform His dreadful oath, such was his force in arms, Had not Saturnian Jove with sudden note Perceived his purpose; with compassion touch'd Of the devoted Frogs the Sovereign shook His brows, and thus the Deities address'd. I see a prodigy, ye Powers divine! And, with no small amazement smitten, hear Prince Meridarpax menacing the Frogs With general extirpation. Haste—be quick— Dispatch we Pallas terrible in fight, Not her alone, but also Mars, to quell With force combined the sanguinary Chief. So spake the Thunderer, and thus Mars replied. Neither the force of Pallas, nor the force Of Mars, O Jove! will save the destined Frogs From swift destruction. Let us all descend To aid them, or, lest all suffice not, grasp And send abroad thy biggest bolt, thy bolt Tempestuous, terrour of the Titian race, By which those daring enemies thou slew'st, And didst coerce with adamantine chains Enceladus, and all that monstrous brood. He said, and Jove dismiss'd the smouldering bolt. At his first thunder, to its base he shook The vast Olympian. Then—whirling about His forky fires, he launch'd them to the ground, And, as they left the Sovereign's hand, the heart Of every Mouse quaked, and of every Frog. Yet ceased not, even at that shock, the Mice From battle, but with double ardour flew To the destruction of the Frogs, whom Jove From the Olympian heights snow-crown'd again Viewing, compassionated their distress, And sent them aids. Sudden they came. Broad-back'd They were, and smooth like anvils, sickle-claw'd, Sideling in gait, their mouths with pincers arm'd, Shell-clad, crook-knee'd, protruding far before Long hands, and horns, with eye-balls in the breast, Legs in quaternion ranged on either side, And Crabs their name. They, seizing by his leg, His arm, his tail a Mouse, cropp'd it, and snapp'd His polish'd spear. Appall'd at such a foe The miserable Mice stood not, but fled Heartless, discomfited.

No lobster on earth, That ever I saw, To me would be worth Sixpence a claw. So, dear madam, wait Till fish can be got At a reas'nable rate, Whether lobster or not; Till the French and the Dutch Have quitted the seas, And then send as much And as oft as you please. TO MRS. NEWTON. Sept. 16, 1781. A noble theme demands a noble verse, In such I thank you for your fine oysters. The barrel was magnificently large, But being sent to Olney at free charge, Was not inserted in the driver's list, And therefore overlook'd, forgot, or miss'd; For when the messenger whom we dispatch'd Enquired for oysters, Hob his noddle scratch'd, Denying that his waggon or his wain Did any such commodity contain. In consequence of which, your welcome boon Did not arrive till yesterday at noon; In consequence of which some chanced to die, And some, though very sweet, were very dry. Now Madam says, (and what she says must still Deserve attention, say she what she will,) That what we call the Diligence, be-case It goes to London with a swifter pace, Would better suit the carriage of your gift, Returning downward with a pace as swift; And therefore recommends it with this aim— To save at least three days,—the price the same; For though it will not carry or convey For less than twelve pence, send whate'er you may, For oysters bred upon the salt sea shore, Pack'd in a barrel, they will charge no more. News have I none that I can deign to write, Save that it rain'd prodigiously last night; And that ourselves were, at the seventh hour, Caught in the first beginning of the shower; But walking, running, and with much ado, Got home—just time enough to be wet through. Yet both are well, and wond'rous to be told, Soused as we were, we yet have caught no cold; And wishing just the same good hap to you, We say, good Madam, and good Sir, Adieu! EPITAPH ON DR. JOHNSON. Here Johnson lies—a sage, by all allow'd, Whom to have bred may well make England proud; Whose prose was eloquence by wisdom taught, The graceful vehicle of virtuous thought; Whose verse may claim, grave, masculine, and strong, Superior praise to the mere poet's song; Who many a noble gift from Heaven possessed, And faith at last—alone worth all the rest. Oh man immortal by a double prize, On earth by fame, by favour in the skies! [Cowper had sinn'd with some excuse] Cowper had sinn'd with some excuse, If, bound in rhyming tethers, He had committed this abuse Of changing ewes for wethers; But, male for female is a trope, Or rather bold misnomer, That would have startled even Pope, When he translated Homer. [In Copeman's ear this truth let Echo tell,—] In Copeman's ear this truth let Echo tell,— “Immortal bards like mortal pheasants well:” And when his clerkship's out, I wish him herds Of golden clients for his golden birds.
