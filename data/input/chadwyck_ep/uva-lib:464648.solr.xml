      <field name="fulltext">DIVINE HYMNS. AN HYMN Upon the Nativity of CHRIST. The Holy Son of God most High, The Historical Narration. For love of Adam's lapsed Race, Quit the Sweet Pleasures of the Sky, To bring us to that happy Place. His Robes of Light he laid aside, Which did his Majesty adorn, And the frail state of Mortals try'd, In Humane Flesh and Figure born. Down from above this Day-Star slid, Himself in living Earth t'entomb, And all his Heav'nly Glory hid In a pure lowly Virgin's Womb. Whole Quires of Angels loudly sing The Mystery of his Sacred Birth, And the Blest News to Shepherds bring, Filling their watchful Souls with Mirth. The Son of God thus Man became, The Application to the Improvement of Life. That Men the Sons of God might be, And by their second Birth regain A likeness to his Deity. Lord, give us humble and pure Minds, And fill us with thy Heav'nly Love, That Christ thus in our Hearts enshrin'd, We all may be born from above. And being thus Regenerate, Into a Life and Sense Divine, We all Ungodliness may hate, And to thy living Word encline. That nourish'd by that Heav'nly Food, To manly Stature we may grow, And stedfastly pursue what's good, That all our High Descent may know. Grant we, thy Seed, may never yield Our Souls to soil with any Blot, But still stand Conquerors in the field, To shew his Power who us begot. That after this our Warfare's done, And Travails of a toilsome Stage, We may in Heav'n, with Christ thy Son, Enjoy our promis'd Heritage. Amen. AN HYMN Upon the Passion of CHRIST The Historical Narration The faithful Shepherd from on high Came down to seek his strayed Sheep, Which in this Earthly Dale did lie, Of Grief and Death the Region deep. Those Glories and those Joys above 'Twas much to quit for Sinners sake: But yet behold far greater Love, Such Pains and Toils to undertake. An abject Life, which all despise, The Lord of Glory underwent, And with the Wicked's worldly guize His righteous Soul for Grief was rent. His Innocence Contempt attends, His Wisdom and his Wonders great; Envy on these her Poison spends, And Pharasaick Rage their Threats. At last their Malice boil'd so high As Witnesses false to suborn, The Lord of Life to cause to die, His Body first with Scourges torn. With royal Robes in scorn th'him dight, And with a wreath of Thorns him crown: A Scepter-Reed, in farther spight, They add unto his Purple Gown. Then scoffingly they bend the Knee, And spit upon his Sacred Face; And after hang him on a Tree Betwixt two Thieves, for more Disgrace. With Nails they pierc'd his Hands and Feet, The Blood thence trickled to the ground: The Pangs of Death his Countenance sweet And lovely Eyes with Night confound. Thus laden with our weight of Sin, This spotless Lamb himself bemoans, And while for us he Life doth win, Quits his own Breath with deep-fetch'd Groans. Affrighted Nature shrinketh back, To see so direful dismal sight; The Earth doth quake, the Mountains crack, Th'abashed Sun withdraws his Light. The Application to the Improvement of Life.Then can we, Men, so senseless be, As not to melt in flowing Tears, Who Cause were of his Agony, Who suffer'd thus to cease our Fears: To reconcile us to our God By this his precious Sacrifice, And shield us from his wrathful Rod, Wherewith he Sinners doth chastise? O wicked Sin to be abhorr'd, That God's own Son thus forc'd to die! O Love profound to be ador'd; That found so potent Remedy! O Love more Strong than Pain and Death, To be repaid by nought but Love, Whereby we vow our Life and Breath Entire to serve our God above! For who for shame durst now complain Of dolorous dying unto Sin, While he recounts the hideous Pain His Saviour felt our Souls to win? Or who can harbour Anger fell, Envy, revengeful Spight or Hate, If he but once consider well Our Saviour lov'd at such a rate? Wherefore, Lord, since thy Son most just, His natural Life for us did spill; Grant we our sinful Lives and Lusts May Sacrifice unto his Will. That to our selves we being dead, Henceforth to Him may wholly live, Who us to free from danger dread Himself a Sacrifice did give. Grant that the sense of so great Love Our Souls to him may firmly tie, And forcibly us all may move To live in mutual Amity. That no pretence to Hate or Strife May rise from any Injury, Since thy dear Son, the Lord of Life, For love of us (when Foes) did die. AN HYMN Upon the Resurrection of CHRIST. Who's this we see from Edom come, The Historical Narration. With bloody Robes from Bosrah Town? He whom false Jews to death did doom, And Heav'n's fierce Anger had cast down. His righteous Soul alone was fain The Wine-press of God's Wrath to tread, Isai. 63. 3. And all his Garments to distain, And sprinkled Cloaths to die blood-red. 'Gainst Hell and Death he stoutly fought, Who Captive held him for three Days: But straight he his own Freedom wrought, And from the dead himself did raise. The brazen Gates of Death he brake, Triumphing over Sin and Hell, And made th'Infernal Kingdoms quake, With all that in those shades do dwell. His Murthered Body he resum'd, Maugre the Grave's close grasp and strife, And all these Regions thence perfum'd With the Sweet hopes of lasting Life. The Application to the Improvement of Life.O mighty Son of God most High, That conqueredst thus Hell, Death, and Sin, Give us a glorious Victory Over our deadly Sins to win. Go on and ? ?????? ???? Phil. Jud. Flesh and Bloud in the moral sense. Edom still subdue, And quite cut off his wicked Race; And raise in us thine Image true, Which sinful The old Adam, Rom. 6. 6. Edom doth deface. Teach us our Lusts to mortify, In virtue of thy precious Death: That while to Sin all dead we lie, Thou maist infuse thy Heav'nly breath. To Righteousness our Spirits raise, And quick'n us with thy Life and Love; That we may walk here to thy Praise, And after live in Heav'n above. Grant we in Glory may appear, Clad with our Resurrection Vest, When thou shalt lead thy flock most dear Up to the Mansions of the Blest. AN HYMN Upon CHRIST's Ascension. God is ascended up on high The Historical Narration. With merry noise of Trumpet's sound, And Princely seated in the Sky, Rules over all the World around. The Tabernacle did of old His Presence to the Jews restrain: But after in our Flesh enfold, A larger Empire he did gain. For suffering in Humane Flesh For all, He rich Redemption wrought, And will with lasting Life refresh His Heritage so dearly bought. Sing Praises then, sing Praises loud Unto our Universal King: Acts 1.9He who ascended on a Cloud, To him all Land and Praises sing. Captivity he Captive led, Triumphing o're the Powers of Hell, And struck their Eyes with Glory dread Who in the Airy Regions dwell. In Humane Flesh and Shape he went, Adorned with his Passion Scars; Which in Heaven's sight he did present More glorious than the glittering Stars. O happy Pledge of Pardon sure, The Applicaion to the Improvement of Life. And of an endless blissful State, Since Humane Nature once made pure For Heav'n becomes so fit a Mate! Lord raise our sinking Minds therefore Up to our proper Country dear, And purify us evermore, To fit us for those Regions clear. Let our Converse be still above, Where Christ at thy right hand doth sit; And quench in us all worldly Love, That with thy self our Souls may knit. Make us all Earthly things despise, And freely part with this World's good, That we may win that Heav'nly prize Which Christ has purchas'd with his Blood That when he shall return again In Acts 1. 11. Clouds of Glory as he went, Our Souls no foulness may retain, But be found pure and Innocent. And so may mount to his bright Hosts On Eagle's wings up to the Sky, And be conducted to the Coasts Of everlasting Bliss and Joy. AN HYMN Upon the Descent of the Holy Ghost at the Day of Pentecost. The Narration When Christ his Body up had born To Heav'n, from his Disciples sight, Then they like Orphans all forlorn Spent their sad Days in mournful plight. But he ascended up on high, More Sacred Gifts for to receive. And freely show'r them from the Sky On those which he behind did leave. He for the Presence of his Flesh To them the Holy Spirit imparts, And doth with living Springs refresh Their thirsty Souls and fainting Hearts. While with one Mind and in one place Devoutly they themselves retire, In rushing Wind the promiss'd Grace Descends, and cloven Tongues of Fire. The House th'Almighty's Spirit fills, Which doth the Feeble Fabrick shake; Acts 2. But on their Tongue such power instils, That makes the amazed Hearer quake. The Spirit of Holy Zeal and Love, The Application. And of discerning, give us, Lord; The Spirit of Power from above, Of Unity and good Accord: The Spirit of convincing Speech, Such as will every Conscience smite, And to the Heart of each Man reach, Acts 2. 37. And Sin and Error put to flight: The Spirit of refining Fire, Searching the inmost of the Mind, To purge all foul and fell desire, And kindle Life more pure and kind. The Spirit of Faith in this thy Day Of Power against the force of Sin, That through this Faith we ever may Against our Lusts the Conquests win. Pour down thy Spirit of inward Life, Which in our Hearts thy Laws may write, That without any pain or strife We naturally may do what's right. On all the Earth thy Spirit pour, In Righteousness it to renew: That Satan's Kingdom 't may o'repow'r, And to Christ's Sceptre all subdue. Like mighty Wind or Torrent fierce, Let it Withstanders all o'rerun, And every wicked Law reverse, That Faith and Love may make all one. Let Peace and Joy in each place spring, And Righteousness, the Spirit's fruits, With Meekness, Friendship, and each thing That with the Christian Spirit suits. Grant this, O holy God and true, Who th'Ancient Prophets didst inspire: Haste to perform thy Promise due, As all thy servants thee desire. AN HYMN Upon the Creation of the World. When God the First Foundations laid The Narration Of the well-framed Universe, And through the darksome Chaos ray'd, The Angels did his Praise rehearse. The Sons of God then sweetly sung, Job 38. 7. At first appearance of his Light, When the Creation Morning sprung To deck the World with Beauty bright. Within six Days he finish'd all Whatere Heaven, Earth, or Sea contain, And sanctify'd the Seventh withall, To celebrate his Holy Name. Then with the Sons of God let's sing Our bountiful Creator's Praise, Who out of nothing all did bring, And by his Word the World did raise. O Holy God, how wonderful Art thou in all thy Works of might, Astonishing our senses dull With what thou daily bring'st in sight! The fit Returns of Night and Day, The grateful Seasons of the Year, Which constantly Man's pains repay With wholesome Fruit his Heart to chear? The shape and number of the Stars, The Moon's set course thou dost define, And Matter's wild distracting Jars Composest by thy Word Divine. The Parts of th'Earth thou holdest close Together by this sweet Constraint: Thou round'st the Drops that do disclose The Rainbow in his glorious Paint. Thy Clouds drop fatness on the Earth, Thou mak'st the Grass and Flow'rs to spring: Thou cloth'st the woods, wherein with mirth The chearful Birds do sit and sing. Thou fill'st the Fields with Beasts and Sheep, Thy Rivers run along the Plains: With scaly Fish thou stor'st the Deep, Thy Bounty all the World maintains. The Application.All these and all things else th'hast made Subject to Man by thy Decree; That thou by Man might'st be obey'd, As duly subject unto thee. Wherefore, O Lord, in us create Clean Hearts, and a right Spirit renew: That we regaining that just state May ever pay thee what is due. That as we wholly from thee are, Both Gifts of Mind and Body's Frame; So by them both we may declare The Glory of thy Holy Name. AN HYMN Upon the Redemption of the World through CHRIST in his Reintroduction of the New Creature. The Lord both Heav'n and Earth hath made, The Narration. His Word did all things frame, And Laws to every Creature gave, Who still observe the same. The faithful Sun doth still return The Seasons of the Year, And at just times the various Moon Now round, now horn'd appears. The Plants retain their Virtue still, Their Verdure and their Form: Nor do the Birds or Beasts their guize Once change, or shape transform. 'Tis only Man, alas! that brake Betimes thy sacred Law, And from that Image Heav'nly, pure, To Beastly shape did grow. He headstrong left thy Holy Will, His own Lusts to pursue; Whence the true Manly Form did fail, And Brutishness ensue. But thou, O God, who by thy Word Didst frame all things of Nought, By the same Word made Flesh, for Man Hast rich Redemption wrought. Thy choice Creation-piece thus marr'd, Thou dost again create, And by th'incarnate Word restor'st Unto his pristine state. The Glory of which Work raying forth, Whiles Christ from Death doth rise, These Two Creations, one Seventh Day By right doth solemnize. The Application.God, who commanded first the Light Out of the dark to shine, 2 Cor. 4. 6.Enliven and enlight our Hearts By his pure Word Divine: That when this New-Creation Work In us is finish'd clear, The bright and glorious Face of Christ May in our Souls appear. That we thus once redeem'd from Sin, Heb. 4. 10.From our own works may cease, And rest in God's eternal Love, The Spirit's Joy and Peace; And quit from this Earth's Toil at last May sing among the Blest In that long-lasting Sabbath-Day, That Jubilee of Rest. Amen FINIS.</field>
