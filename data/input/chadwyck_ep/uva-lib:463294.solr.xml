[Ouids fable of Narcyssus.] The Argument of the fable. The ende of the Argument. Lireope had a Sonne by Cephicious named Narcissius, whose contynuaunce of lyfe Tyricias a prophete, affyrmyd to be longe, .. .. yf the knowledge of hym selfe, procuryd not the contrary, whose sentence here nowe Ecco the callynge Impe, frome whome Iuno had berefte the ryght vse of speche, so loued this Narcyssus, that throughe the thought and care that she sustayned, for the gettynge hys good wyl that euer despysed her, she consumed the relykes, of whiche consumed Carcas were torned into Stones. The greate dysdayne of Narcyssus, herein Ramusia Straungely reuenged, for he heated through h?tinge by the drynkynge of a well, supposynge to quence hys thruste espyed therin the shadowe, of hys face, wherewyth he was so rauyshed that hauynge no power to leue hys blynde desyre for the attaynyng of an impose belytye, there he starued. For the preperacion, whose buryall the Nimphes, had ordyned souch furnituer as ther vnto apperteyned &amp; had. Retornyd to the Solemne, Erthynge and buryall of suche a carcase, they founde in sted of the ded Corpis a yelow floure which with vs beareth the name of a daffadylly. Lireope whome once Ciphicious, dyd embrace, and raushe ? his crokid floudes wher she was shut fr? grace Dyd trauell and brynge forth, when tyme of berth befel a chyld euen then wh? loue had lyked well, And hym Narcissus named of whome the lot to learne, yf he shoulde number manye yeares, and perfecte age discerne The reder of hys fate Tiricious yea dyd saye If that the knowledge of hym selfe, his lyfe dyd not decaye, Ful longe a vayne pronounce, this semed tyll hys death, By furye quaynte dyd make it good, &amp; vnsene lose of brethe For twentye yeares and one, Narcissus death escaped what tyme no chylde was seene so fayre, nor yong man better shapyd, A nomber bothe of men and maydes, did hym desyre, But bewtye bente wyth proude dysdayne, had set hym so on fyre That nether those whome youthe in yeares, had made his make Nor pleasaunte damsels freshe of heue, coulde wyth him pleasure take This man the fearfull hartes, inforcynge to hys nettes The caulyng nimphe one daye, behelde that nether euer lettes To talke to those that spake, nor yet hathe power of speche Before by Ecco this I mene, the dobbeler of skreeche A body and no voyce, was Ecco yet but howe The blabbe had then none other vse of speach, then she hath now The later ende to geue of euery sence or clause, wherof the wyfe of Iupiter, was fyrst and chyfe the cause For that when she dyd seke, the syllye Imphes to take that ofte she knewe wythin the hylles, had lodged wyth her make This Ecco wyth a tale, the goddes kepte so longe that well the Imphes myght her escape, but wh? she sawe this wrong This tonge quod she where wyth, so ofte thou dydeste dysceaue the goddes Iuno lyttyll vse of speche, shall erste receaue And so her thretininges proue, yet Ecco endyth speche wyth dobling sound the wordes she heareth, &amp; sendeth a gaine w? screch Thus when Cyphicious Sonne, the desartes walkinge faste wyth wandrynge pace she had espyed, her loue and on hym caste Wyth stealyng steppes, she foloweth fast her hote desyre and styl the nerer that she comes, the hotter is her fyre None other wyse then as the nerer fyre dothe lye to brimstone matters mete to borne to flayme doth more applye, Howe ofte oh wolde she fayne, wyth plesaunte wordes him glad and faune on hym wyth prayers swete, but nature it forbad, And letteth her to begynne, but that she doth permytte full preste is Ecco to perfourme accordyng to her wytte, In lystynge for to heare, some sounde hys mouth escape whereto her wordes she myghte applye, &amp; him an answere shape. By chaunce Narcissus, led from companye alone dyd saye is anye here to whome, she answereth her a none, He musyth and amasyd, doth loke on euerye syde and caulyng loude come nere he sayth, whom she byds yeke abyde, Agayne he looketh aboute, and seynge none that came, whystlyst thou me quod he, who harde her answere euen the same He stayeth and not knowyng, whose this sounde should be come hether let vs mete he sayde, and let vs mete quod she Then with so good a wyll, as thoughe she neuer harde a sound that lyked her halfe so well, to answere afterwarde And to perfourme her wordes, the woodes she soone forsooke and to imbrace that she desyred, aboute the necke hym tooke He flyeth faste awaye, her foulded armes that sprede aboute hys necke he caste awaye, and euer as he flede Death would I chuse, ere thou hast power of me quod he whom she none other answere made, but thou hast power of me and after that wyth leues, she hid her shamefast face wythin the woodes in hollow caues, maketh her dwellynge place, Yet loue dothe no whyt more decrese, but wyth her smarte agmentith styll and watchynge cares, consumyth her wretched harte, By lenenes eke her skyne is dryed, and to eare her bloude consumeth, so hath she nought, but voyce &amp; bones to spare, Whereof is nothinge lefte, but voyce for all her bones they saye as to her lykeste shape, were tourned into stones, And sence the woodes hath bene, her home her selfe to hyde from euerye hyll and nought, but sounde in her dothe none abyde, Thus here they other nymphes, of wooddes and waters borne had he dysceaued, and youngmen yeke, a nomber had in skorne, At last wyth handes lyfte vp, soone to the goddes dyd playne that so hys hap myght be, to loue and not be loued agayne, Wherto it semed wel, Ramusya gaue eare and sought to graunte this iuste request, it after dyd appeare A sprynge there was so fayre, that stremes like syluer had whiche nether shepardes happe to fynde, nor gotes that vpwarde gad Uppon the rocky hyls, nor other kynde of beste, wyth flashyng feete to foule the same, or troble at the leste, Wherin them selues to bathe, no byrdes had made repare, nor leffe had fallen from any tree, the water to appeare, About the which the grounde had made some herbes to growe and eke the trees had kept the sunne, from c?mynge doune so lowe Narcyssus theare through heate, and wery hunters game glad to take rest dyd lye hym downe, and fast beheld the same, And as he thought to drynke, hys feruent thurste to slake A dryer far desyre hym toke, by lokyng in the lake For seynge as he dranke, the image of hys grace therewyth he rapt, fell streyght in loue, wyth shadowe of his face And museth at hym selfe, wyth whych astonyed cheare, as image made of marble whyte, his countenance dyd apeare, Lyke starres he seyth hys eyes, and bacchus fyngeres swete he thoughte he had on goulden heares, for Phebus not vnmete A necke lyke yuery whyte, a mouth wyth sauoure good a face wyth skynne as whyte as snowe, well coleryd wyth bloud All whych he wonders at, and that he lyketh well is euen him selfe that wonder makes, with small aduice to dwell He sees that he doeth aske, agayne doth hym desyre together he doeth burne him selfe, and kyndel eke the fyre The well that him dysceaued, how ofte kyst he in vayne howe ofte there in his armes he dround, in hope for to attayne The necke, that he desyred so muche to imbrace, and yet himselfe he could not catche, in that vnhappye place Not knowyng what he seeth, therewith he is in loue and those same eyes that, erroure blindes, to errour dothe him moue Ah foole, why doest thou seke, the shape that wyll not byde nor beyng hathe, for turne thy face, away and it wyll slyde The shadowe of thy selfe, it is that thou doest see and hath no substaunce of it selfe, but comes and bydes with thee Yf thou canste go awaye, with thee it wyll departe yet nether care for meate or slepe, could make him thus affarte But in that shadowe place, besyde the well he lyes where he behelde his fayned shape, with vncontented eyes And lyfting vp those eyes, that his, destruction made vnto the trees that stode aboute, he raught his armes and saide Hath euer loue, oh woodes delte crueller with man you knowe that hyding place, hath bene to louers now and than Now can you call to mynde, you that suche worldes haue laste that euer anye pyned so, by loue in ages paste.

But as by fyre, to waxe ameltyng doth insue and as by hete the rysing sunne, consumeth the mornynge due, So feblyd by loue, to waste he doth begynne at lenght and quyte consumeth, by heate of hydyng fyre wythin, And nether hath he nowe, heare of red and whyte no lyuelynes nor lusty strength, that earst dyd eyes delyte Nor yet the corpys remaynes, that Ecco once had loued whiche tho wyth angry mynd she vewed, to sorow she was moued, And loke howe ofte alas, out of hys mouth dyd passe so ofte agayne wyth boundyng wordes, she cryed alas alas, And when that he hys sydes, wyth rechles handes dyd stryke she also then was hard to make, a sounde lamentynge lyke Thus lokyng in the well, the last he spake was thys alas thou ladde to much in vayne, beloued of me a mys, Whych selfe same wordes agayne, this Ecco streight dyd yell and as Narcissus toke hys leue, she bad hym eke fayre well Hys hed that hym abused, vnder the grasse he thraste and deth shut vp those eyes, that on there master mused faste And when he was receyued, into that hyllye place he yeke wythin the ogly stype, behelde hys wretched face The wood and wattrye nimphes, that all hys susterne were bewayles hys lot as is ther wonte, wyth cuttynge of theyr heare Whose waylinge Eccoes sounde dyd mournyng lyke declare for graue pompe, a bayre wyth lyghtes and fyre they dyd prepare Then body was ther none, but growing on the ground a yelowe flower wyth lylly leaues, in sted therof they founde. FINIS. FABVLE. The moralization of the Fable. in Ouid of Narcissus. A tale wherein some wysdome may be founde May be alowed, of suche as lyes refuse, Hereon I meane not, that my wytte can grounde A matter fytte for all menne to vse, The prayse hereof I vtterly refuse, And humbly them beseche to reade the same, Me to excuse or by theyr Iudgement blame. For neither I presume, by youthfull yeares, The umbelnes of y? author. To clayme the skyl that elder folkes, doe wante, Nor vndertake that wyser often feares, To venter on my spites, then would pante Right well I knowe, my wyttes be all to skante But I by your correction, meane to trye, If that my head to reason can applye. I meane to shewe, accordyng to my wytte To suche as inbrase not knolege. That Ouyd by this tale no follye mente But soughte to shewe, the doynges far vnfytte Of soundrye folke, whome natuer gyftes hath lente, In dyuers wyse to vse, wyth good in tente And howe the bownty torneth to theyr payne That lacke the knowledge, of so good a gayne Whiche Ouid now this Poete sure deuine Profitable co?sel Doth collour in so wonderfull a sorte That suche as twyse, refuse to reade a lyne Wyth good aduice, to make there wytte resorte To reasons schole, their Lessons to reporte Shall neuer gather Ouids meanyng straunge That wysdome hydeth, with some pleasaunt chaunge. Hys tales doe Ioyne, in suche a godly wyse, That one doth hange vpon anothers ende, As who should saye, a man should not despyse, To loke before whiche waye hys worke wyll bende And after howe he maye the same amende Thus Ouid bydes hys readers for to knowe The thynges aboue as well as those belowe The fable that he tretyd of before Is howe that Iuno fell in argumente Wyth Iupiter, whiche after leasuer more To wryte at lardge, then tyme conueniente For souche acause haue in defferente But to be shorte, Tericious was theyr iudge Whose sentence Iuno semed for to grudge For she because he sayde not as she wolde Bereft him of his eyes and made him blinde As one vnfitt to vew the worlde that coulde No better Iudge vnto a womans mynde Redres where of none Iupiter colde find But with some honour to releue his wooe Eche thinge to come he made him surely knowe. The for meste profe, where of in this same tale Lireope, the nymphe receued nowe That dyd demaunde an answere not to fayle If that her Childe, to home her lykinge vowe Euen at the fyrste was geuen him to allowe shoulde not parfite years, and manie growe Yea yea quod, he him selfe yf he not knowe. Here as I sayd, appearith that the ende Desserne the truth of euery thynge.Of euery tale another doth begynne Here lykewise may we se the poette, bende To byd vs loke his meaninge here with in Supposinge that, ther wittes be verye thin That will be holde the skabard of the blade And not the knife wherfore the shethe was made. For if that Ovids meaninge was to wryghte But how Narcissus, drinkinge of a wel With shade of him selfe dyd so delyghte That there til deth he thoughte to starue and dwell Bothe him a foole, a ly in verse to tell The wise mighte think, &amp; those that rede the same To be vnwyse and merite greatier blame. The torninge of Lycaon to a, beast God punisheth for sinne. Doth well declare that to the wickid sorte Full heneous plagis preparid be at leaste Of god that to ther doinges will resorte With Iustice hande at home they cannot sporte But yf they seke for to withstande his wyll They finde to worke them selues a waye to spill. By sayinge eke, of Pirha, &amp; her make God preserueth the Iuste. Dengalyon from the consuming floude What else is mente but god a boue dothe take An order euer to presarue the good From perill still, in timis that they be woode That few or none but souche as god doth chuse Can happie lyue, or them from harme excuse. And Daphus chaunginge to the laurer grene A prayse of verginite. whose leues in winter neuer loste there hue Doth well to vs betokin as I wene That souche as to virgynitie be true Mortall glorye euer shall ensue And as the laurer lyues in winters rage So shall ther prayse though death deuour there age. Of Pheton eke Appolles wretched sonne That wolde presume his fathers carte to gyde A good warning to yonge people. Of corage more, then counsell wel begonne what may be thoughte, but souche as will a byde with small aduice not from there will to slyde And do refuse ther fathers councel suer There helpeles harmis, vnto them selues procuer. What nedyth me examples to reherse Sith I do take an other thinge in hande These shewe that poetties colour vnder verse Souch wysdome as they can not vnderstande The hede wysdome of the poetes.That lyghtelye lyst to loke on lernynges lande But suche as wyth aduyce, wyll vewe the same Shall lessons fynde therby, ther lyues to frame And now to tourne vnto the tale I meane To treate vppon when that the dome was rede, Of this Cephicious sonne, by one that cleane Had lost the syght of all that nature brede A vayne pronounce, it semed that he sprede Whose sentence hym selfe, dyd not know To perfyght age hys lyfe he shall bestowe. Tericias heare whome maye we lyke vnto Happy ar they that do soo.Euen suche a man, as hath no mynde to gayne Wyth ryghteus lyppes, that seke no wronge to do That yelde to ryches, for no maner of payne Ne yet the truthe in anye thinge wyll layne Which shall as he was blynde for Iustice sake Be quyte berefte of all that he can make. For he that wylnot Iunose seruaunte be I meane not now the pleasyng of the stoute Truth is often shente.And myghty dames that wolde haue all agre Unto theyr fancees that they go aboute But he I saye, and profe doth put no doute That wyl not seke the ryche foulke to please Through hate and wronge, hath often lyttle ease. Yet when they lacke this vse of worldely syghte That lyttel haue they lefte on erthe to see And that by wronge another hath theyr ryghte Bycause to wyll, ther wyttes wolde not agre By losse herof they got agreater fee For god of good doth gyue the knowledge more Then all the gayne of erthe coulde the restore. For wher theyr eyes be caste from worldely welth And haue respecte to thynges that be a boue In moche more perfecte wyse the certayne helthe The cars of the worlde leteth vertue.Shall they dyscerne, then souche as haue a loue To vayne desyers that ryse for to remoue And forther be they a byll to a vowe Of hydden thinges then worldlye folke alawe. But as Teryssus Iudgemente semed vayne The folish people regard no vertu nor good co?sell. In the foreredyng of Narcyssus fate So folyshe folke, from credyt wyll refrayne Of wysdomes voice, that seldome comes to late They only marke, the presente erthely state Without regarde of anye thynge at all What in this lyfe or after may befaule And yeke agayne regarde howe Ouid heare Of prophecies doth show the doughtefulnes Profecies be doughtful to medell with all. Whose meanynge neuer playnely doth appeare In doughtefull wordes that hath a hid pretence wheron we gesse, but greate experience Full ofte we fynde and prouynge of the same Doth well declare our iudgementes be by ame Wherfore we nether oughte to make to lyghte we muste refer those thinges y? passeth our knowledge. By the depining of a skylfull voyce Nor yet presume so fare aboue oure myght As of the certayne skanning to reioyce Of hedden thinges that reche beyonde our choyse For who can surely say it wyll be so Or dyssaloue the thynge they do not knowe Tericyas voice dyd Pentheus despyse In countynge faulse the thynges that he foresawe Yet of his deth they gesse dyd seme to wyse Which he for tould by hys deuininge law And Pirechus iugemente yeke appeared vayne That wolde presume of dowtfull speche to make A certayne sence the meaning to mystake. People to take on them y? y? passeth there knowledge.So that herby righte well we maye regarde what happe they haue that worke by doughteful gesse To skorninge folke, &amp; yeke the euile rewarde That often faulyth the poete doth expresse Thus two extremes he teachis to redresse And by Narcissus warnith vs to be ware Of the mishap, that pride doth still repare For wel Narcissus may betoken here Souche one as hath that other members wante Prid marreth al.As strengthe and power a cause of weakers feare A passing witte aboue the ingnoraunte Of beughtie ffayer in riches nothinge skante And to conclude frome chefe of natuers packe That hath the choyse that other thousandes lacke. Who beinge decked with so goodlye giftes shall haue a nomber that will moche requier Of the acquayntaunce, for the diuers dreftes Which fancie craueth to content desyre But yf he haue the same a busyd fyer That this Cephicious sonne did her receaue Exampile take him selfe he shall desceaue. A proude harte c?meth to confuci?.The man that thinkes him selfe to haue no make Eche offred frendeship, streighte, will quite refuse For so narcissus carid not to take The feloweship of souch as sought to chuse His companie a boue the reste to vse But as by pride he grwe in great disdayne So for rewarde his ende was full of payne. Whose strengthe is souche that it can moch preuayle Yet cannot saye, I am the mooste of ryghte That rich is and bewty be vayne.Whose heapis of golde, be of foul hyghe a vayle Yet nede not brage, to be the ritchest wight Whose bewghtie yeke full pleasaunte is in syghte Yet hath no cause to saye a boue the reste I all dyspice for natuer made me beste. No Cretuer hath euer yet bene soche That can iustely saye, I moste excell God thought here of the pride was verye moche A notabill exs?pell for proude people. When Lucyfer he caste from heauen to hell In showynge wher presuminge folkys should dwell None oughte to truste to ryches or to strengthe To power or bewtye, all consumith at lengthe. The Ryche, and proude, dysdaynefull welthye man To the ryche or dysdainfull man. That Lazarus forbad, the crommes to eate Whiche from his borde shoulde fall mighte after ban His mouche a boundaunce and his dentye meate Which was the cause of all his torment greate Yet yf he coulde haue vsed well his gayne He lyttel shoulde haue had of all his payne. Marke thys Now Cressus yeke, the welthy kinge of Lide Whose soms of goulde wer passinge to be toulde Dyd se at laste his ritches wolde not byde As Solon sayde his ende that did be houlde Wherfore we proue, who potteth ther truste in golde Or slypper welthe ar sene in care to dwell And lose at laste, the good they like so well. Of strengthe agayne, who will him selfe auaunce No man oughte to truste in his owne strength. shall se that conqueste goes not all by myghte This Dauid made the Phelystians, to graunte That slue there giaunte Golyas ther knighte Agaynste the which noman the thought to wyghte For al his pride yet sawe they at the laste Him ouer throwe and ded by Dauydes caste.

Pryde is the destroyer of many good gyftes.That bewties babes, muste bide the hard prepare That ofte is sente, to bate their Iolye chere Emonge the reste, doth Absalon declare When not wythstanding, all his bewtie clere And eke his fayre and yelowe golden heare Betwene the bowes dyd hange, tyl that hys foes Wyth deathes despatche, dyd ryd hym of his wooes. The transitory th?ges of this world are not to be trustyd.The sorowes greate, of Menelawes wyfe Whose bewtie fayre, so farre to se was sought The wretched ende, of Cleopatres lyfe Whose ryche araye, was all to derely bought Dothe plainly shewe, that all was vaine and nought Thus riches strengthe and power, confesse we muste Wyth bewtie eke, to slypper be to truste. Agayne we se, eche mortall thynge decaye A damage by dyspleasure, hath the ryche And bewties blomis, full sone are blowne awaye The stronge by syckenes, feles a feble stitche From wele to woe, thus by promyse pytche Our tyme is toste, with suche vnsuerties change As to beholde, aduice maye thinke full strange. Yet some ther be so pouffed vp with pride Disdayn fullnes and orabell vice. And as Narcissus, drouned in dysdayne That lyghte regarde they haue what will abide So farre vn ware of ther in suing paine Of other folke vnreakinge they remayne As tho they thoughte, who worthie wer to be A mate fulmete, &amp; felowe fite for me. To whome it happes as to Cephicious sonne It chaunced her which Ecco did dyspise The caulinge nimphe which ernist loue begonne In hastie sorte dyd ende in wofull wise Not muche vnlyke the vayne desyers that rise By fruteles thoughts to get some folyshe thinge Which harme, or else repentaunce farre will bring. But by thys fable some there be suppose That Ouyd mente to showe the fauinge sorte A flaterar is not to be trusted. Of flattringe folke whose vsage is to glose With prayers swete, the men of gretiest, porte And moste of welthe to whome the still resorte In hope to gete, refusing nought to lye The ende of speche as Ecco they applye. For yf the men by whome they wene to gayne No man shal learn the truth of a flaterar. shall saye me thinketh that this is verye well Euen verye well they aunswer strayght agayne As tho aduice had byd them so to tell When verye nought they same mighte, reason spell The ende of euerye fortunes darlinges voice Thus they repete with out a forther choyse. Nowe yf a tiraunte saye it shall be so None other thinge but so they haue to speake Although it tourne a thousande vnto wooe The condycyons of a flaterar. The strong maye floupe to wracke maye goo the weke So they the Riche, maye please they nothinge racke The same, they saye, they aunswer after warde As though it twise were worthye to be herde. And leste I seme to ouerskippe the sence Bocas a wryter of this sameOf anye wryghter worthye to be knowne Wherby the poettes wise and hid pretence With other wittes by trauell greate, great hath sowne To showe what good of Ouides seede, is growen Through my defaute maye skanned be a mysse Uppon this fable, Bocase wryghtethe this. By Ecco whiche dothe, spoken wordes repleate And els is dome, I faine doo vnderstande That mortaule folke dothe Ioue with feruente heate And foloweth faste, in euerye plase and lande As thinges wheron, her beinge all dothe stande And yet the same a nomber will forsake And lyghte esteme for folyshe pleasures sake. Within whose well of shininge, gaye delyghtes That we maye lyke vnto a water coulde That slydynge is some time as Bocase, wryghtes Them selues that is, ther glorye, they be holde And are so sure in luste and pleasure coulde That rapte therewith not abyll to astarte From thense they be or from ther madnes parte. Fame other good or euell.And there at Laste, they dye which shame forsoke That them somoche desyred to embrace Whose lyfe so loste, for lyttell prayse dyd loke Of vertuse voyce, that bydes in euerye place And byddeth fame to euery Coste to chase There prayses greate that cause well deserue Not with there Corpis to let, there name to starue. But suche as, will make lyght the loue, of fame For Lycorous luste, that lyketh them so well By good desarties, and rekes for no good name Howe muche in wytte, or beughtie they excell Howe stronge or ryche so euer they shall dwell Ther deinty ioyes, there body name and all They lose at ones, which dethe ther lyfe, dothe call. And yf pare happes, that natuer dyd bestowe More good of them in lyfe then of the reste And that ther by there some remembraunce growe Of natuers bountye, gyuen them for the beste Euen lyke a fadinge flower, this flytinge geste I maye recimbell, which is freshe to daye And yet or night is wetherid clene awaye. What Bocas mente thus somwhat haue I toulde The skanninge to of others ges herein Of youthfull tyme yll spent. I haue and will at laste at large vnfoulde But where I left, nowe fyrste I will begynne To showe howe moche the hastye sorte shall winne By there dysdayne, the which Narcissus here Dothe represente to me as dothe appeare. For fyrste who was his bewtye and his shape There with and notes of others his dysdayne And then shall marke of his ende and his myshape Who blinded was with his to good a gayne As in a glasse shall se the picture playne Of a full proude and ouer weninge wyghte That natures gyftes dysdayne to vse arighte. And sythe I haue declared here before What lyttell truste, of ryghte we ought to haue To that, whiche we receue, for to restore To hym that firste our pleasynge treasures gaue To suer to Ioye but when he lyste to craue The good he sente the same he takyth a waye Or we be ware, our hap so soone decaye. Nowe wyll I showe that erste I sayd I wolde Of this same talke in some Comparing sorte What I conceue, the whiche not as I sholde Yf I declare, and that my wittes resorte Without the reche of wisdomes sober porte Nowe of the learned I doo craue And of my Iudgmente here the sence you haue I fayne a man, to haue a godly wytte The selfe same yeares that this Narcissus hade With lyke dysdayne of others farre vnfytt And then immagin one that wolde be glade With counsayle good to cause him for to knowe To make his witte bothe sober wise and sade That prides rewarde is to be made ful lowe And thissame one I, Ecco presuppose By whome I gesse that good aduice is mente Whiche is ful lothe a godly witte to lose And sorye moche to se the same ylspente She foloweth him therfore for this intente To make him marke and well regarde the ende Of euerye thinge that he dothe once intende. To suche as speke with out advisemente.Her nature is not to be full of talke Not to deuice, but to aduice full well wordyes y? springe fr? youthefull thoughtes at walke Not greinge still to reasons sober spelle The endinge sence whereof she aye doth yel As who shoulde saye we ought to regarde the cause And ende of speche ofte spoke with lyttell, pause. For sythe eche wordys and doinge oughte of righte To be refarred vnto some reasons ende With out respecte, whereof lyttel mighte Our doinges reste which to no porpose bende To sharpiste wittes, aduice, her loue douth sende As fyttiste foulkes, to gayne her greate good will If they receyue the good, she profers stil. Nowe howe she waues this man, that hath this witte I nede not tell, syth Ouyd doth declare But hym she foloweth as she thinkes it fitte Tell that she se him, voyde, of wanton care To shape an aunswere then she dothe prepare To euerye cencethat he shall speake or sounde To cause him marke therof the certayne grounde. The ende of euerye sence she repetis To suche as geue them selues ouer to pleasur of vanites Where by for what he spake he maye deserne But he that on the vaynes of pleasuer beatis His wanton shippe without astedye starne Of good aduice shall nothynge racke to learne But her refuse when she wolde him inbrace Affection so a waye doth reasone chase. So this same man whome nature witte hath lente A vertue greate to them that vse it well Wytte well vsed moste nedes be profitabell. Aduice, perhappes canne be contente To heare and lysten what her wordes can spell But when he once espies she thinketh to dwell Contenually with him to be his make Here offrid frendeshipe strayght he doth for sake. To lyue by losse his good he doth refuse Unbrydelyd will oh whether wilte thou trayne This wandring witte that hath no power to chuse The reddye waye to souche a perfite gayne But as the blynde to passage right, dothe paine Him selfe no more then when he goith amis To winne thy woys asmouche thy trauayle is. But whye accause I will that maye be charmed By good aduice yf thou haddeste not dysdayne Pryde is a vayne thinge. Thy pride, thy pryde, hath worste of all the harmed That poufes the vp vppon presumcions vayne Whiche maketh those, continue, that wold be fayne Of thy good will to make thy wittes full wise Whose loue thou haste, the proffet to despise. This witte refusing good aduice loue And wandringe faste to willes vncertayne reach To suche as dysdaynes good counsayl. Dothe let her starne, that sought a waye to moue Then happye ende that profe doth playnelye teache Is full prepared, dysdaynefull folke to appeache Whose pride is souche as puttes a waye the sighte Of counsayle good and euerye iugement righte. And so aduice I leue forsaken quite As Ecco was for all her greate good will And will declare, wittes rashe and madd dyspite Of suche a frende neglect for lacke of skyll Wherby he faste procures him selfe to spill As one vnware, of all his wooes to come Whose reckles lyfe receueth a wretched dome. A careles lyfe thus led in youthfull yeares A wilfull waye be semeth well to take So this same witte as wilde desyer him steres Unconstantely, for luste and pleasures sake From this to that his vayne inuenciones wake A resteles time in nedeles worke doth spende Till that hereof he findes the folyshe, ende. Then werye quite of all this wanton sporte And trustinge moche to tast a more stabyll drynke To prayse well bycause he dothe resorte Whereby mishappe, he rather comes I thynke Whose pleasaunte fare, and swete delyghtinge drinke Who shall approche will thinke a thousand yeare Tyll they haue sene there, in the water cleare. Which hath in it no foule nor oglye syghte Nor lothsome lokiynge ther a bate to stande The syluer streames so shininge be and brighte As can delyghte the greatest lorde in lande The Ladys yeke full fayer wyth hande in hande Will faste repare vnto this pleasaunte well Wherewith aduice, I wyshe them all to dwell. Whiche for bycause that witte dyd quite dyspyse Nowe marke his harme, and harde predestenid woo This well he faste behouldes in musynge wise And lyes to drinke where more his thurste dothe growe A lasse for that him selfe he doth not knowe For ther he seethe the image of his grace Hys shape and yeke proporcion of his face. His wittes his strengthe and euerye other gyfte That maye be thoughte a vertue anye waye Appeareth therwith euerye sondrye shifte That nature sendeth to make the carkes gaye And yeke that Fortune lendes for eche assaye There nought is hid that is worthye prayse to pyke Nor ought is sene, that men mighte well mislike. Where on they faster that his eyes be caste There at the more his maruell doth increace And yeke the more his maruel thus doth laste The lesse he sekes his blinde desyer to cease Which for syth loue to putte him selfe in prese To lyke the thyng that better ware to lacke Then by souche loue to bringe him selfe to wracke. For who so Couettes that he cannot catche And moste aloweth that nedyth mooste amendes With so good will, and still desyres to watche Suche wretched Ioyes a corsid, lyfe that spendeth As profe doth teache vnto dystruccion bendes Delyted so with that he shoulde refuse And quite for sakinge that he oughte to chuse. But of his loue suche is the blynde, respecte And suche the swete, delightinge wretched plighte That his a vaile he blyndelye doth neglecte To helpe him selfe as one that hath no mighte So rauished is he with the pleasinge sighte Of that to him whiche lyttell pleasure gaynes Unlesse we counte the wynning good of paynes. For in this well to well he vewes the forme Of euerye gyfte, and grace that nature gaue To hym for that he chefelye shoulde perfourme With good, moche good, his good therby to saue Yet be his good, as sure is euel to haue He gaynis the losse that other neuer fele Which haue not wone suche welthe by fortunes whele. And whye bycause he demes not as he oughte Eche vertue lyketh value of the same There be to many suche.His face, the beste that euer was wrought And shape he thinkes deserueth no maner blame By wytte he wennes ful wyunderus thinges to frame And what he hathe he thinkes all the beste Besyds him selfe dispicinge all the reste. All though in dede, he nether be so fayer So well proporsinid, nor so suerlye wise Ne yet in strengthe, be abyll to compayre With halfe the nomber that he dyd dyspise A boue them al he thinkes him selfe to prise, Whiche ouer weninge, wins him all his wooe A simpyll gayne I count, that hurtes me so. For rapte so faste, through his abused eyes To suche as flatter th? seluesEuen on him selfe, whereof he doth delighte With in this well no fautes he euer spies Whereby him selfe he anye waye might spite But as eche face appearithe, fayre &amp; quyte Thoughe it be foule with in the flatringe glas This lyinge lake, shewes euerye gyfte to passe. Wherto he strayght consentes by Iudgemente blind And grauntes to haue asmuch as semeth, and more So easye lo, selfe loue is nowe to kinde So some is had, so swete agreuous sore So glade he is to kepe his harmis in store So moche desyrous for to abyde his woo And yeke so lothe his mischefe to for goo. Which causith this, bycause of natuere all Be pleased well, well of them selues to here And yet the wyse, with good aduice will calle Unto them selues yf they, deserue to beare The praysys greate which seme so true &amp; cleare By others mouthes whiche euer taulke the beste Of them they se, in good estate to reste. Now witte that wantes all that wisdom willes The wise to haue is voyde of this respecte For what he hath he thinkes it greatlye skylles But what he is, the whylst he doth neglecte Thus Ioye to haue, so mouche doth him infecte That care to be, so good as he appeares He quite forsaketh, so blyndely loue him bleres. Through which he losythe euerye verteous strengthe And lackes the skyl, so godlye gyftes to vse So euery good doth tourne to bade at lengthe And he consumeth, him selfe that doth abuse This lot is sente to him that will refuse Aduices loue, to lyghte on prayseth well Wher tyll he starue he still delytes to dwell. To starue I meane, the good he hath to lose To whiche I thinke him selfe he suer doth binde That of him selfe more good doth presuppose By lokinge in this present well so blinde Them in him selfe a wiser man can finde For who dothe couet him selfe of wyser skole Then dedes him showe, doth proue him selfe a fole. Who thinkes he hath more then he doth posses In this not only is dysseued quite But hath so moche of that he hath the lesse Of wit I meane, wherin who shall delyghte More then he oughte him selfe doth this dyspite Un wittinge clene, the more he thinkes he hathe Euen by somoche, hath lesse as Plato sayth. So he that demes, his witte a boue the reste Suche as thinkes them selues wise and yet ar folysh. So moche the lesse, then others, hath here by And he that thinkes, his one of all the beste The worste of all it reason will replye Al though the same he neuer can espie Bycause he trusteth the lyinge well of prayse Whereby his wit and all he hath decayes. For syth, the well of prayse, aswell concistes Uppon the springes of vnaduised talke As of the voyce of wisdome, that resistes The speches of foolys, whose tonges a wrye will walke Besydes the pathe, of reasons, gidinge balke It maye welbe that suche them selues dysseaue As of vntrouth, a certayne truthes conseue. Thus what hath made, this witte to starue we se We must not truste our owne wittes beste.Selfe loue the very hid consuming sore Of godly wittes, that else coulde well agre To euery sence of wisdoms presente lore And now to showe the very cause wherfore They lose the strength of this so good a gayne And leue aduice, forsothe it is dysdayne. This enuius heare, dysdayne, this dayntie, thynge When it begins to harbour, in thy breste Of anie man this harme it fyrste doth bringe Contempte of those in better state, that reste Then he is in, that counteth to be beste So that his faultes, who fayne wolde haue him knowe And by his frende he countes him as his foe. Then of contemptes procedyth, hautye pride The contemptes of vertue commeth by pryde.The which who gettes shall neuer lyghtely leue So grete an euel so faste as sene to byde Euen to the beste when it beginneth to cleue That honour, wit, or anie gyfte receue This of dysdayne, contempte, wherof procedes The poyson pride, this same selfe loue that bredes. All dysdayne ful folkes are compared vnto Narcyssus.Wherfore hereby I may conclude, a right That as contempte, dyd cause Narcissus quayle So by dysdayne eche wyghte, doth lose his myghte And euery vertue through thissame, doth faile As well Narcissus proueth in this same tale Who loste through loue eche thinge he mooste dyd lyke For his dysdayn who worse reuenge could pike. Can greter woo to anie man beside Then that to lose wherin he moste delites No suer and yet to syrcuyte and pride This is the Iuste reuenge, that still requites Ther grete dysdayne, and al ther oulde dispites To lacke of that, at laste they lyke so well Which wante aboundaunce, makes with them to dwel. This sence is straunge, &amp; yet as true as quainte This is worthy to be marked. That plentie shoulde be cause of greter, lacke A man in helthe can neuer, lyghtlye faynte The haypye man no missery dothe smacke The Riche, by ritches, feles no nedye, wracke Agayne who sittes in honours shyningchare Is farre inough from wretched peoples share. And what can happe, thus harme the happie man Or can suche welth, ther maister bringe to woo A true saynge. Can honors, forse ther honors them to ban Can all this good so greue vs thus what no Yes yes alas it proueth often so Of agis paste exaumpils neuer grounde Of these our dayes to manie may be founde. Be therfore al these godly gyftes to blame Honor &amp; Ryches by godes good gyftes. Bycause they come to wracke that them possesse Na to be ryche it is no maner shame Ne honour hurtis that helps to redres The wronged foulke whome rigour doth oppres Nor oughte is euel wherof the rightefull vse Who shal obserue maye haue a Iuste excuse. But this aboundaunce who shall euell abuse Be ware of a busynge honor and ryches. And quite forget from whence these vertues flowe The good they haue therby they quite refuse And euery gyfte vnto agrefe shall growe Mysuse of good thus them shall ouer throwe Euen as Minaruais pipis that Marcias founde Misused him harmed with swetenes of the sound. This Marcias, was a boysterous country man The pleasaunte pipes of pallase once he founde The which to blowe assone as he began Euen of them selues dyd gyue so swete a sounde That better thoughte he not a boue the grounde Wher in he strayghte dyd take so grete a pride As though his mouthe dyd al, this musyke gyde. Through whiche the musys with ther armonye He thoughte could not so swete a sounde prepare And eke Appollo god of melodye He maye dysende doune from his shininge chare Also with him presuminge to compare Full well contente to lose his lyfe if he Made not his pypes more swetely to agre. Then musikes god who seinge all his pride Him fyrste dyd farr excel in conning playe And then to make him by his couenaunte, byde He made the skyn, of all his bodye flaye An euell rewarde for this his vayne assaye Un happye gyfte that gyues no better gayne Naye folyshe man, that gydes it to thye payne. Good gyftes mysse vsed.So that heareby I gather euerye gyfte Misusyde maye harme the honours of the same And though to some, that natures bountye lyfte A grace where of a nother shall be lame This godly gefte, is not a whyte to blame Although their honours through the same shall quayle The rightefull vse, that lacke, of souche a vayle. For yf so be, that Marcias had knowen That of him selfe, not all his conning came He nether wolde haue striuen to haue blowne Ne yet presumed to venter for the game With him that was the aucther of the same If he had knowen howe, well to vse this gaine He it mighte well haue kepte &amp; not bene flayne. But who can knowe, that wil dysdayne to learne And who can lerne that reckes not to be taughte That desdain is the destroyer of the wisdome. So well to vse his welthe who can deserne That this dysdayne, this vename, greate, hath caughte This same made Marcias, that he neuer raught To knowe of whome his melodye dyd rise This made Narcissus, Ecco yeke dyspise. And to conclude this causyde, witte forsake Aduice whose lacke, dyd lose him all his gayne For loke euen as Narcissus by the lake His beughtie loste by bewtyes sore dysdayne And that his profet purcheste, all his payne So witte, that hath dysdayne, shall so presume That throughe his witte, his wit shall clene consume. Wherfore, this vice, that euerye vartue marres A good wyshe of y? Aucther. That priuate weale, conuerts to preuate woo That eche degre, ther rightefull dewtye bares Who redyth, this tale, I wishe, so well mighte knowe That in ther hartes, no sede therof mighte growe Where of eche, wighte deuoide, by good aduise Maye ryghtely vse there gyftes of greatiste prise. Thus haue you harde the simpill sence That I haue gatherid by my symple witte Of Ouides tale, whose wise &amp; hid pretence Though as I shoulde parhappes I haue not hitte Yet as I could and as I thoughte it fitte I haue declared, what I can conseue Full glade to learne, what wiser folke parceaue And now to kepe my couenaunte &amp; procede Fysius a writer of the same. Of others Iugementes, to declare the fecte Of thissame tale, Ficius wrytes in dede A wise oppinion not to be neglecte Of souche asseme, to be of reasons secte The which I wolde not skip emonge the reste Leaste his Inuencion, some maye thinke the beste. A rashe mans minde, that hath no skyl sayth he By this Narcissus verye well is mente His proper shape, that hath no power to se That is the proper, office which is sente Unto the minde, by no meane can conuente To se and marke, as eche man oughte of righte And to performe accordinge to ther mighte. But as Narcissus, onlye dyd desyer Hys shadowe in the water to imbrace So this same minde dothe nothinge els requier Of brittil bewtye, but to marke the case That in the bodye hath the bydinge place Which onlye is the shadowe of the minde As it mighte knowe in case it were not blinde. Thus minde, thus noughte desyringe, but his shade That is the beutie in the carcase frayle Not beinge abyl to deserne the trade The which it oughte of righte for to assayle Hereby forsaketh, quite the one a vayle And losyth bothe his proper shape herein And yeke his shadowe hath no power to win. For euery minde, becoms the bodys man In so louinge it, it selfe, dothe quite despise The boddys vse, and yet it no waye can Enioy and haue accordinge to the guise And order due that natuer doth deuice But thus doth both the bodys vse mystake And of it selfe the office true forsake. Better it is to haue the mynd garnished w? vertu then a folyshe bodi bewtyfulThe office of the minde, is to haue power Uppon the bodye, and to order well The bodys office yeke in euery hower It is of the minde to lerne the perfite skyll The vayne desyers that rise, him by to kill Wherby the mynde dothe kepe his perfite strength And yeke the bodye vanquishe loste at length. Now where the minde is drowned with desyre Of suche delyghtis as to the bodye longe The boddye then moste nedes consume with fyer Of raginge lustes a boute the same that thronge So that the minde, is cause of bothe ther wronge To put it selfe, out of the proper place And bringe the bodye, to so euel a case. For thus the minde, that oughte of righte, to be The m?d beynge replenyshed with euyl bryngeth body &amp; soule to confusion The teacher of the bodye to do well Doth make the same to euery euill agre Procuringe that it shoulde of right expell Wherby in bothe, a mouinge blinde doth dwell Euen as within Narcyssus dyd remayne That through his shadowe to be soche agayne. And as Narcissus, neuer coulde attayne The rewarde of suche as geue th? selues to vayne pleasurs. His shadowe which he wisshed for so faste And that his loue dyd lede him to his payne Euen so thys minde that reasons bondes hath paste It selfe and from, the proper place hath caste Shall neuer gayne that it dothe moste desyer Suche is to folye styll the folowinge hire. For thoughe it Couet moche, a safe estate And seke it selfe to plante in perfite plighte Yet this desyer, prosedyth all to late When will is bente, to loue vayne delight Whose rashe regarde descerns not blacke from whyte Who wolde be well, worketh other wise Of beinge well, the suertie dothe despise. And when this minde, hath wroughte somoche amisse Thus blindely from his perfecte, place to fall We moste nedys graunte a kinde of dethe it is A thinge deuine, and perfecte, to be thrall Unto the carcas moste corrupt of all When this immortall minde, shall seke to serue Eche mortall thinge, his vertue nedes muste sterue. This is the meaninge of Ficius sence That in this wise one Plato doth wryghte And nowe to show, the learned mennes pretence With Ouides tale the reders to delyghte Two there were that somewhat dyd indite Of this same fable, whiche I will declare Leaste anye wryter I maye seme to spare. The one hereof, asence deuine, doth make No foole he semethe, that walles hath to name And englyshe man, which thus doth vndertake For sowles behoufe, to deskant on this same There by sayth he a nomber moche to blame That as Narcissus, lettes there bewty quale Because they quite misuse there good auayle. For dyuers whych in bewty, much excell Eyther inshape that in the bodys gyft In knowledge els whych in the mynd, doth dwell Or to conclude in ryches, which is lyft To sundry men by fortunes hydynge shyft Before the same so puffed vp wyth pryde That all, to base, they thynke wyth them to byde. What then, to thys what is the due reward Forsoth these derlynges wyth theyr great dysdayne wythin the well of worldly wealth, regarde Thys same apperaunce of their blysfull gayne Whych lastith not, but as the shadowe, vayne Doth passe a waye, euen so doth come to goe Eche thynge we haue the vse affyrmeth so. Now in thys welle the apperaunce of theyr state Doth them so please and eke so well contente That seynge it they nothynge else awaite The nought can lowe they nothyng can consent To prayse or lyke but all to thys intente Them selues, full farr aboue the rest aduaunce And styll to glorye of here happye chaunce Thus through this glorye of ther lyfe to moche The chefeste lyfe, the lyfe of soules the lose There blinde desyer and fonde regarde is soche Them selues in all this daunger, for to close This Englyshe wryter heare of doth thus suppose The other nowe whome Italye dyd brede As foloweth wrytes, to them that shall yet rede. In Grece there was a passinge fayer yonge man A Learnyd man of Italye a writer of y? same Whose beutye broughte him vnto suche a pride That through thessame vnto such dysdayne he ran As but him selfe he none coulde well a bide But counted other all as vile besyde Through which his ende was wretchedly to dye With in the woodes to starue and ther to lye. And wheras Oued, doth hereof affirme That this Narcissus, was traunsformed at laste Mannes lyfe is lyke a flowere. Into a flower, he only doth confirme That youth and bewghte, come and soone be paste Euen as the flower, that wetherithe full fast And for by cause, in wodes the nimphes do dwell His deathe bewaylyd of them dothe Ouid tell. Agayne where the poete dothe a vowe That this Narcissus dyed by a lake It maye well be, by cause he dyd a lowe None fette or worthye to become his make But euery man despysing, dyd for sake That some of hatrid and of malyce fell For his dysdayne dyd drowne him in a well. Thus moche this same Italyan wryter here Doth finde as true, his wryghtinges do proffes So it maye well be all that wrote appeare Of this same fable other more or lesse That stil dysdayne doth cause the greter distres Of euery good that natuers bountie gyues To eche estate, vppon the yearthe that lyues. Wherfore who hath, no sparckel of this vice Are lyke to kendel in them selues no flame Of anie euel but styll by good aduice Shall so them selues and all there doinges frame As shall at all deserue no maner blame Whoe wantes this vice therby shall chefely staye To euerye euell the very reddy waye. Thus haue you harde what hath ben thought By soundry foulke, of thissame Ouides tale Where by I proue that al herin haue soughte To showe that Ouid wryt for good a vale Declaringe howe they lykest ar to quayle That greatyst store of anie good receyue The ryghtfull vse therof and leaste perceue. To moche posses so that it is no prayse But thynges possessed, ryghtfully to vse For eche possescion, by and by decayes And suche as by possescinge shall abuse All they posses, with shame, shall sone refuse Wherfore the moste, ar worthy to posses Whose spotlesse dedes, the rychest vse expresse. And thus my simpel trauayle I commende Unto euery one, prayinge you to take The same in worthe and when more yeares shall sende More wyt and yoke more knowledge shall a wake Suche labours lyke I mene not to forsake As knoweth god who kepe vs alwaye Saue and defend vs from all decaye.
