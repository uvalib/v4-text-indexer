      <field name="fulltext">TO Master John Hussey Delaval. THE FABLES of PHÆDRUS, Freed Man of AUGUSTUS, After the Manner of ESOP. In FIVE BOOKS. THE FIRST BOOK OF THE FABLES of PHÆDRUS. Prologue. [What from the founder Esop fell] What from the founder Esop fell, In neat familiar verse I tell: Twofold's the genius of the page, To make you smile and make you sage. But if the critics we displease, By wrangling brutes and talking trees, Let them remember, ere they blame, We're working neither sin nor shame, 'Tis but a play to form the youth By fiction, in the cause of truth. FABLE I. The Wolf and the Lamb. By thirst incited, to the brook The Wolf and Lamb themselves betook. The Wolf high up the current drank, The Lamb far lower down the bank. Then, bent his rav'nous maw to cram, The Wolf took umbrage at the Lamb. “How dare you trouble all the flood, “And mingle my good drink with mud?” “Sir,” says the Lambkin, sore afraid, “How shou'd I act, as you upbraid? “The thing you mention cannot be, “The stream descends from you to me.” Abash'd by facts, says he, “I know “'Tis now exact six months ago “You strove my honest fame to blot”— “Six months ago, Sir, I was not.” “Then 'twas th'old ram thy sire,” he cry'd, And so he tore him, till he dy'd. To those this fable I address, Who are determin'd to oppress, And trump up any false pretence, But they will injure innocence. FABLE II. The Frogs desiring a King. With equal laws when Athens throve, The petulance of freedom drove Their state to licence, which o'erthrew Those just restraints of old they knew. Hence, as a factious discontent Thro' every rank and order went, Pisistratus the tyrant form'd A party, and the fort he storm'd. Which yoke while all bemoan'd in grief (Not that he was a cruel chief, But they unus'd to be controul'd) Then Esop thus his fable told. The Frogs, a freeborn people made, From out their marsh with clamour pray'd, That Jove a monarch wou'd assign With pow'r their manners to refine, The sovereign smil'd, and on their bog Sent his petitioners a log, Which, as it dash'd upon the place, At first alarm'd the tim'rous race, But ere it long had lain to cool, One slily peep'd out of the pool, And finding it a king in jest, He boldly summon'd all the rest. Now, void of fear, the tribe advanc'd, And on the timber leap'd and danc'd, And having let their fury loose, In gross affronts and rank abuse, Of Jove they sought another king, For useless was this wooden thing. Then he a water-snake empow'r'd, Who one by one their race devour'd. They try to make escape in vain, Nor, dumb thro' fear, can they complain. By stealth they Mercury depute, That Jove wou'd once more hear their suit, And send their sinking state to save; But he in wrath this answer gave, “Ye scorn'd the good king that ye had, “And therefore ye shall bear the bad.” Ye likewise, O Athenian friends, Convinc'd to what impatience tends, Tho' slav'ry be no common curse, Be still, for fear of worse and worse. FABLE III. The vain Jackdaw. Lest any one himself shou'd plume, And on his neighbour's worth presume; But still let nature's garb prevail— Esop has left this little tale. A Daw, ambitious and absurd, Pick'd up the quills of Juno's bird; And, with the gorgeous spoil adorn'd, All his own sable brethren scorn'd, And join'd the peacocks—which in scoff Stripp'd the bold thief, and drove him off. The Daw, thus roughly handled, went To his own kind in discontent: But they in turn contemn the spark, And brand with many a shameful mark. Then one he formerly disdain'd, “Had you (said he) at home remain'd, “Content with nature's ways and will, “You had not felt the peacocks bill; “Nor 'mongst the birds of your own dress “Had been deserted in distress.” FABLE IV. The Dog in the River. The churl that wants another's fare Deserves at least to lose his share. As thro' the stream a dog convey'd A piece of meat, he spy'd his shade In the clear mirrour of the flood; And thinking it was flesh and blood, Snapp'd to deprive him of the treat— But mark the glutton's self-defeat Miss'd both another's and his own, Both shade and substance, beef and bone. FABLE V. The Heifer, Goat, Sheep, and Lion. A partnership with men in pow'r We cannot build upon an hour. This fable proves the fact too true— An Heifer, Goat, and harmless Ewe, Were with the Lion as allies, To raise in desert woods supplies. There, when they jointly had the luck To take a most enormous buck, The Lion first the parts dispos'd, And then his royal will disclos'd. “The first, as Lion hight, I crave; “The next you yield to me, as brave; “The third is my peculiar due, “As being stronger far than you; “The fourth you likewise will renounce, “For him, that touches, I shall trounce.” Thus rank unrighteousness and force Seiz'd all the prey without remorse. FABLE VI. The Frogs and Sun. When Esop saw, with inward grief, The nuptials of a neigh'bring thief, He thus his narrative begun— Of old 'twas rumour'd that the Sun Wou'd take a wife: with hideous cries The quer'lous Frogs alarm'd the skies. Mov'd at their murmurs, Jove inquir'd What was the thing that they desir'd? When thus a tenant of the lake, In terror for his brethren spake. “Ev'n now one Sun too much is found, “And dries up all the pools around, “Till we thy creatures perish here; “But oh how dreadfully severe, “Shou'd he at length be made a sire, “And propagate a race of fire!” FABLE VII. The Fox and Tragic Mask. A fox beheld a Mask—“O rare “The head-piece, if but brains were there!” This holds—whene'er the fates dispense Pomp, pow'r and every thing, but sense. FABLE VIII. The Wolf and Crane. Who for his merit seeks a price From men of violence and vice, Is twice a fool—first so declar'd As for the worthless he has car'd; Then after all, his honest aim Must end in punishment and shame. A bone the Wolf devour'd in haste, Stuck in his greedy throat so fast, That tortur'd with the pain he roar'd, And ev'ry beast around implor'd, That who a remedy could find, Should have a premium to his mind. A Crane was wrought upon to trust His oath at length—and down she thrust Her neck into his throat impure, And so perform'd a desp'rate cure. At which, when she desir'd her fee, “You base, ungrateful minx”, says he, “Whom I so kind forbore to kill, “And now forsooth you'd make your bill.” FABLE IX. The Hare and the Sparrow. Still to give cautions, as a friend, And not one's own affairs attend, Is but impertinent and vain, As these few verses will explain. A Sparrow taunted at a Hare Caught by an Eagle high in air, And skreaming loud—“Where now,” says she, “Is your renown'd velocity? “Why loiter'd your much boasted speed?” Just as she spake, an hungry glead Did on th'injurious railer fall, Nor cou'd her cries avail at all. The Hare, with its expiring breath, Thus said, “See comfort ev'n in death! “She that derided my distress “Must now deplore her own no less.” FABLE X. The Wolf and Fox, with the Ape for their Judge. Whoe'er, by practice indiscreet, Has pass'd for a notorious cheat, Will shortly find his credit fail, Tho' he speak truth, says Esop's tale. The Wolf the Fox for theft arraign'd; The Fox her innocence maintain'd: The Ape, as umpire, takes his seat; Each pleads his cause with skill and heat. Then thus the Ape, with aspect grave, The sentence from the hustings gave: “For you, sir Wolf, I do descry “That all your losses are a lie— “And you, with negatives so stout, “O Fox, have stol'n the goods, no doubt.” FABLE XI. The Ass and Lion hunting. A coward, full of pompous speech, The ignorant may over-reach; But is the laughing stock of those, Who know how far his valour goes. Once on a time it came to pass, The Lion hunted with the Ass, Whom hiding in the thickest shade, He there propos'd shou'd lend him aid, By trumpeting so strange a bray That all the beasts he shou'd dismay, And drive them o'er the desert heath Into the lurking Lion's teeth. Proud of the task, the long-ear'd loon Struck up such an outrageous tune, That 'twas a miracle to hear— The beasts forsake their haunts with fear And in the Lion's fangs expir'd: Who being now with slaughter tir'd, Call'd out the Ass, whose noise he stops— The Ass, parading from the copse, Cried out with most conceited scoff, “How did my musick-piece go off?” “So well—was not thy courage known, “Their terror had been all my own.” FABLE XII. The Stag at the Fountain. Full often what you now despise, Proves better than the things you prize, Let Esop's narrative decide. A Stag beheld, with conscious pride, (As at the fountain head he stood) His image in the silver flood, And there extols his branching horns, While his poor spindle shanks he scorns— But lo! he hears the hunter's cries, And frighten'd o'er the champaign flies— His swiftness baffles the pursuit: At length a wood receives the brute, And by his horns intangled there, The pack began his flesh to tear. Then dying thus he wail'd his fate; “Unhappy me! and wife too late! “How useful what I did disdain! “How grievous that, which made me vain!” FABLE XIII. The Fox and the Crow. His folly in repentance ends, Who to a flatt'ring knave attends. A Crow, her hunger to appease, Had from a window stol'n some cheese, And sitting on a lofty pine In state, was just about to dine. This when a Fox observ'd below, He thus harangu'd the foolish Crow. “Lady, how beauteous to the view “Those glossy plumes of sable hue! “Thy features how divinely fair! “With what a shape and what an air! “Cou'd you but frame your voice to sing, “You'd have no rival on the wing.” But she, now willing to display Her talents in the vocal way, Let go the cheese of luscious taste, Which Reynard seiz'd with greedy haste. The grudging dupe now sees at last, That for her folly she must fast. FABLE XIV. The Cobler turn'd Doctor. A bankrupt Cobler, poor and lean, (No bungler e'er was half so mean) Went to a foreign place, and there Began his med'cines to prepare: But one, of more especial note, He call'd his sov'reign antidote; And by his technical bombast Contriv'd to raise a name at last. It happen'd that the king was sick, Who, willing to detect the trick, Call'd for some water in an ew'r, Poison in which he feign'd to pour; The antidote was likewise mix'd; He then upon th'empiric fix'd To take the medicated cup, And, for a premium, drink it up— The quack, thro' dread of death, confess'd That he was of no skill possess'd; But all this great and glorious jobb Was made of nonsense and the mob. Then did the king his peers convoke, And thus unto th'assembly spoke: “My lords and gentlemen, I rate “Your folly as inordinate, “Who trust your heads into his hand, “Where no one had his heels japann'd.”— This story their attention craves, Whose weakness is the prey of knaves. FABLE XV. The sapient Ass. In all the changes of a state, The poor are the most fortunate, Who, save the name of him they call Their king, can find no odds at all. The truth of this you now may read— A fearful old man in a mead, While leading of his Ass about, Was startled at the sudden shout Of enemies approaching nigh— He then advis'd the Ass to fly, Lest we be taken in the place; But loth at all to mend his pace, “Pray will the conqueror,” quoth Jack, “With double panniers load my back?” “No,” says the man—“If that's the thing,” Cries he, “I care not who is king.” FABLE XVI. The Sheep, the Stag, and the Wolf. When one rogue wou'd another get For surety in a case of debt, 'Tis not the thing t'accept the terms, But dread th'event—the tale affirms. A Stag approach'd the Sheep, to treat For one good bushel of her wheat— “The honest Wolf will give his bond.” At which, beginning to despond, “The Wolf (cries she) 's a vagrant bite, “And you are quickly out of sight; “Where shall I find or him or you, “Upon the day the debt is due?” FABLE XVII. The Sheep, the Dog, and the Wolf. Liars are liable to rue The mischief they're so prone to do. The Sheep a Dog unjustly dunn'd One loaf directly to refund, Which he the Dog to the said Sheep Had giv'n in confidence to keep. The Wolf was summon'd, and he swore It was not one, but ten or more. The Sheep was therefore cast at law To pay for things she never saw. But lo! ere many days ensued, Dead in a ditch the Wolf she view'd— “This, this (she cry'd) is heav'n's decree “Of justice, on a wretch like thee.” FABLE XVIII. The Woman in Labour. With pain we recollect the place Where once we've suffer'd some disgrace. A Woman, reck'ning to a day, Upon the ground in labour lay; Pierc'd with her cries, her lover said, 'Twas better she should go to bed, And nature's load deposit there. But she made answer in despair, “I cannot trust myself for aid, “Where all the mischief first was made.” FABLE XIX. The Bitch and her Puppies. Bad men have speeches smooth and fair, Of which that we should be aware, And such designing villains thwart, The underwritten lines exhort. A Bitch besought one of her kin For room to put her puppies in: She, loth to say her neighbour nay, Directly lent both hole and hay. But asking to be repossess'd, For longer time the former press'd, Until her puppies gather'd strength, Which second lease expir'd at length— And when, abus'd at such a rate, The lender grew importunate, “The place (quoth she) I will resign, “When you're a match for me and mine.” FABLE XX. The hungry Dogs. A stupid plan that fools project, Not only will not take effect, But proves destructive in the end, To those that bungle and pretend. Some hungry Dogs beheld an hide Deep sunk beneath the crystal tide, Which, that they might extract for food, They strove to drink up all the flood; But bursten in the desp'rate deed They perish'd, ere they could succeed. FABLE XXI. The Old Lion. Whoever, to his honour's cost, His pristine dignity has lost, Is the fool's jest and coward's scorn, When once deserted and forlorn. With years enfeebled and decay'd, A Lion gasping hard was laid: Then came, with furious tusk, a boar, To vindicate his wrongs of yore: The bull was next in hostile spite, With goring horn his foe to smite: At length the ass himself, secure That now impunity was sure, His blow too insolently deals, And kicks his forehead with his heels. Then thus the Lion, as he dy'd, “'Twas hard to bear the brave,” he cry'd; “But to be trampled on by thee “Is nature's last indignity; “And thou, O despicable thing, “Giv'st death at least a double sting.” FABLE XXII. The Man and the Weasel. A Weasel, by a person caught, And willing to get off, besought The man to spare—“Be not severe “On him that keeps your pantry clear “Of those intolerable mice.” “This were,” says he, “a work of price, “If done intirely for my sake, “And good had been the plea you make: “But since, with all these pains and care, “You seize yourself the dainty fare “On which those vermin us'd to fall, “And then devour the mice and all, “Urge not a benefit in vain.” This said, the miscreant was slain. The satire here those chaps will own, Who, useful to themselves alone, And bustling for a private end, Would boast the merit of a friend. FABLE XXIII. The faithful House-Dog. A man that's gen'rous all at once May dupe a novice or a dunce; But to no purpose are the snares He for the knowing ones prepares. When late at night a felon try'd To bribe a Dog with food, he cry'd, “What ho! do you attempt to stop “The mouth of him that guards the shop? “You're mightily mistaken, Sir, “For this strange kindness is a spur “To make me double all my din, “Lest such a scoundrel should come in.” FABLE XXIV. The proud Frog. When poor men to expences run, And ape their betters, they're undone. An Ox the Frog a grazing view'd, And envying his magnitude, She puffs her wrinkled skin, and tries To vie with his enormous size: Then asks her young to own at least That she was bigger than the beast— They answer, No—With might and main She swells and strains, and swells again. “Now for it, who has got the day?” The Ox is larger still, they say. At length, with more and more ado, She rag'd and puff'd, and burst in two. FABLE XXV. The Dog and the Crocodile. Who give bad precepts to the wise, And cautious men with guile advise, Not only lose their toil and time, But slip into sarcastic rhime. The Dogs that are about the Nile, Thro' terror of the Crocodile, Are therefore said to drink and run. It happen'd on a day, that one, As scamp'ring by the river side, Was by the Crocodile espy'd: “Sir, at your leisure drink, nor fear “The least design or treach'ry here.” “That (says the Dog) ma'm, would I do “With all my heart, and thank you too, “But as you can on Dog's flesh dine, “You shall not taste a bit of mine.” FABLE XXVI. The Fox and the Stork. One should do injury to none; But he that has th'assault begun, Ought (says the fabulist) to find The dread of being serv'd in kind. A Fox, to sup within his cave The Stork an invitation gave, Where, in a shallow dish, was pour'd Some broth, which he himself devour'd; While the poor hungry Stork was fain Inevitably to abstain. The Stork, in turn, the Fox invites, And brings her liver and her lights In a tall flaggon, finely minc'd, And thrusting in her beak, convinc'd The Fox that he in grief must fast, While she enjoy'd the rich repast. Then, as in vain he lick'd the neck, The Stork was heard her guest to check, “That every one the fruits should bear “Of their example is but fair.” FABLE XXVII. The Dog, Treasure, and Vulture. A dog, while scratching up the ground, 'Mongst human bones a treasure found; But as his sacrilege was great, To covet riches was his fate, And punishment of his offence; He therefore never stirr'd from thence, But both in hunger and the cold, With anxious care he watch'd the gold, Till wholly negligent of food, A ling'ring death at length ensu'd. Upon his corse a Vulture stood, And thus descanted—“It is good, “O Dog, that here thou liest bereav'd, “Who in the highway wast conceiv'd, “And on a scurvy dunghill bred, “Hadst royal riches in thy head.” FABLE XXVIII. The Fox and Eagle. Howe'er exalted in your sphere, There's something from the mean to fear; For, if their property you wrong, The poor's revenge is quick and strong. When on a time an Eagle stole The cubs from out a Fox's hole, And bore them to her young away, That they might feast upon the prey— The dam pursues the winged thief, And deprecates so great a grief; But safe upon the lofty tree, The Eagle scorn'd the Fox's plea. With that the Fox perceiv'd at hand An altar, whence she snatch'd a brand, And compassing with flames the wood, Put her in terror for her brood. She therefore, lest her house should burn, Submissive did the cubs return. FABLE XXIX. The Frogs and Bulls. Men of low life are in distress, When great ones enmity profess. There was a Bull-fight in the fen, A Frog cried out in trouble then, “O what perdition on our race!” “How (says another) can the case “Be quite so desp'rate as you've said? “For they're contending who is head, “And lead a life from us disjoin'd, “Of sep'rate station, diverse kind.”— “But he, who worsted shall retire, “Will come into this lowland mire, “And with his hoof dash out our brains, “Wherefore their rage to us pertains.” FABLE XXX. The Kite and the Doves. He that would have the wicked reign, Instead of help will find his bane. The Doves had oft escap'd the Kite, By their celerity of flight: The ruffian then to coz'nage stoop'd, And thus the tim'rous race he dup'd. “Why do you lead a life of fear “Rather than my proposals hear? “Elect me for your king, and I “Will all your race indemnify.” They foolishly the Kite believ'd, Who having now the pow'r receiv'd, Began upon the Doves to prey, And exercise tyrannic sway. “Justly (says one, who yet remain'd) “We die the death ourselves ordain'd.” The End of the First Book. THE SECOND BOOK OF THE FABLES of PHÆDRUS. Prologue. [The way of writing Esop chose] The way of writing Esop chose, Sound doctrine by example shows; For nothing by these tales is meant, So much as that the bad repent; And by the pattern that is set, Due diligence itself should whet. Wherefore, whatever arch conceit You in our narratives shall meet (If with the critic's ear it take, And for some special purpose make) Aspires by real use to fame, Rather than from an author's name. In fact, with all the care I can, I shall abide by Esop's plan: But if, at times, I intersperse My own materials in the verse, That sweet variety may please The fancy, and attention ease; Receive it in a friendly way; Which grace I purpose to repay By this conciseness of my song: Whose praises, lest they be too long, Attend, why you should stint the sneak, But give the modest, ere they seek. FABLE I. The judicious Lion. A Lion on the carcass stood Of a young heifer in the wood; A robber that was passing there, Came up, and ask'd him for a share. “A share (says he) you should receive, “But that you seldom ask our leave “For things so handily remov'd.” At which the ruffian was reprov'd. It happen'd that the self-same day A modest pilgrim came that way, And, when he saw the Lion, fled: “Says he, there is no cause of dread, “In gentle tone—take you the chine, “Which to your merit I assign.”— Then having parted what he slew, To favour his approach withdrew. A great example, worthy praise, But not much copied now-a-days! For churls have coffers, that o'erflow, And sheepish worth is poor and low. FABLE II. The Bald-pate Dupe. Fondling or fondled—any how— (Examples of all times allow) That men by women must be fleec'd. A dame, whose years were well increas'd, But skill'd t'affect a youthful mien, Was a stay'd husband's empress queen; Who yet sequester'd half his heart For a young damsel, brisk and smart. They, while each wanted to attach Themselves to him, and seem his match, Began to tamper with his hair; He, pleas'd with their officious care, Was on a sudden made a coot— For the young strumpet, branch and root, Stripp'd of the hoary hairs his crown, Ev'n as th'old cat grubb'd up the brown. FABLE III. The Man and the Dog. Torn by a Cur, a man was led To throw the snappish thief some bread Dipt in the blood, which, he was told, Had been a remedy of old. Then Esop thus—“Forbear to shew “A pack of dogs the thing you do, “Lest they should soon devour us quite, “When thus rewarded as they bite.” One wicked miscreant's success Makes many more the trade profess. FABLE IV. The Eagle, the Cat, and the Sow. An Eagle built upon an oak— A Cat and kittens had bespoke A hole about the middle bough; And underneath a woodland Sow Had plac'd her pigs upon the ground. Then treach'rous Puss a method found To overthrow, for her own good, The peace of this chance neighbourhood. First to the Eagle she ascends— “Perdition on your head impends, “And, far too probable, on mine; “For you observe that grubbing swine “Still works the tree to overset, “Us and our young with ease to get.” Thus having fill'd the Eagle's pate With consternation very great, Down creeps she to the Sow below; “The Eagle is your deadly foe, “And is determin'd not to spare “Your pigs, when you shall take the air.” Here too a terror being spread, By what this tattling gossip said, She slily to her kittens stole, And rested snug within her hole. Sneaking from thence with silent tread By night her family she fed, But look'd out sharply all the day, Affecting terror and dismay. The Eagle, lest the tree should fall, Keeps to the boughs, nor stirs at all; And, anxious for her grunting race, The Sow is loth to quit her place. In short, they and their young ones starve, And leave a prey for Puss to carve. Hence warn'd, ye credulous and young, Be cautious of a double tongue. FABLE V. Cæsar and his Slave. There is in town a certain set Of mortals, ever in a sweat, Who idly bustling here and there, Have never any time to spare, While upon nothing they discuss With heat, and most outrageous fuss; Plague to themselves, and to the rest A most intolerable pest. I will correct this stupid clan Of busy-bodies, if I can, By a true story—lend an ear, 'Tis worth a trifler's time to hear. Tiberius Cæsar, in his way To Naples, on a certain day Came to his own Misenian seat (Of old Lucullus's retreat) Which from the mountain top surveys Two Two seas, viz. the Sicilian and Tuscan.—I adhere to the old reading in this place, where Phædrus explains a nicety in the Latin tongue. Dr. Bentley is altogether mistaken, by supposing there is no difference between the meaning of prospicere and prospectare, which latter word is of more force, and means commanding things at a greater distance. seas, by looking different ways. Here a shrewd slave began to cringe, With dapper coat and sash of fringe, And, as his master walk'd between The trees upon the turfted green, Finding the weather very hot, Officiates with his wat'ring-pot; And still attending thro' the glade, Is ostentatious of his aid. Cæsar turns to another row, Where Xystum signifies a close walk secured from the weather; which circumstance heightens the pleasantry of the tale. neither sun nor rain could go; He (for the nearest cut he knows) Is still before with pot and rose. Cæsar observes him twist and shift, And understands the fellow's drift— “Here, you, sir, (says th'imperial lord?”) The bustler, hoping a reward, Runs skipping up—The chief in jest Thus the poor jackanapes address'd— “As here is no great matter done, “Small is the premium you have won— “The Alluding to the custom of manumission amongst the Romans, which was by a gentle blow. cuffs that make a servant free, “Are for a better man than thee”. FABLE VI. The Eagle, Carrion Crow, and the Tortoise. No soul can warrant life or right, Secure from men of lawless might; But if a knave's advice assist, 'Gainst fraud and force what can exist?— An Eagle on a Tortoise fell, And mounting bore him by the shell— She with her house her body skreens, Nor can be hurt by any means. A Carrion Crow came by that way, “You've got (says she) a luscious prey; “But soon its weight will make you rue, “Unless I shew you what to do.” The captor promising a share, She bids her from the upper air To dash the shell against a rock, Which would be sever'd by the shock. The Eagle follows her behest, Then feasts on Turtle with his guest. Thus she, whom nature made so strong, And safe against external wrong, No match for force, and its allies, To cruel death a victim dies. FABLE VII. The Mules and Robbers. Two laden Mules were on the road— A charge of money was bestow'd Upon the one, the other bore Some sacks of barley—he before, Proud of his freight, begun to swell, Stretch'd out his neck, and shook his bell. The poor one, with an easy pace, Came on behind a little space— When on a sudden, from the wood A gang of Thieves before them stood, And, while the muleteers engage, Wound the poor creature in their rage: Eager they seize the golden prize, But the vile barley-bags despise. The plunder'd mule was all forlorn, The other thank'd them for their scorn.— “'Tis now my turn the head to toss, “Sustaining neither wound nor loss.” The low estate's from peril clear, But wealthy men have much to fear. FABLE VIII. The Stag and the Oxen. A Stag unharbour'd by the hounds, Forth from his woodland covert bounds, And blind with terror, at th'alarm Of death, makes to a neighb'ring farm; There snug conceals him in some straw, Which in an Ox's stall he saw. “Wretch that thou art! (a bullock cry'd) “That com'st within this place to hide, “By trusting man you are undone, “And into sure destruction run.” But he with suppliant voice replies, “Do you but wink with both your eyes, “I soon shall my occasions shape, “To make from hence a fair escape.” The day is spent, the night succeeds, The herdsman comes, the cattle feeds, But nothing sees—then to and fro Time after time the servants go; Yet not a soul perceives the case. The steward passes by the place, Himself no wiser than the rest— The joyful Stag his thanks addrest To all the Oxen, that he there Had found a refuge in despair. “We wish you well (an Ox return'd) “But for your life are still concern'd, “For if old Argus comes, no doubt, “His hundred eyes will find you out.” Scarce had the speaker made an end, When from the supper of a friend The master enters at the door, And (seeing that the steers were poor Of late) advances to the rack. “Why were the fellows hands so slack— “Here's hardly any straw at all, “Brush down those cobwebs from the wall. “Pray how much labour would it ask?”— While thus he undertakes the task, To dust, and rummage by degrees, The Stag's exalted horns he sees.— Then calling all his folks around, He lays him breathless on the ground. The master (as the tale declares) Looks sharpest to his own affairs. Epilogue. [A Statue of great cost and fame] A Statue of great cost and fame Th'Athenians rais'd to Esop's name, Him setting on th'eternal base, Whom servile rank could not disgrace; That they might teach to all mankind The way to honour's unconfin'd, That glory's due to rising worth, And not alone to pomp and birth.— Since then another seiz'd the post, Lest I priority should boast, This pow'r and praise was yet my own, That he should not excell alone: Nor is this envy's jealous ire, But emulation's genuine fire. And if Rome should approve my piece, She'll soon have more to rival Greece. But should th'invidious town declare Against my plodding over-care; They cannot take away, nor hurt Th'internal conscience of desert. If these my studies reach their aim, And, reader, your attention claim, If your perception fully weighs The drift of these my labour'd lays; Then such success precludes complaint— But if the pictures which I paint Should happen to attract their sight, Whom luckless nature brought to light, Who scorn the labours of a man, And, when they carp, do all they can; Yet must this fatal cause to mourn With all its bitterness be borne, Till fortune be asham'd of days, When genius fails, and int'rest sways. The End of the Second Book. THE THIRD BOOK OF THE FABLES of PHÆDRUS. Prologue to Eutychus. The tales of Phædrus would you read, O Eutychus, you must be freed From bus'ness, that the mind unbent May take the author's full intent. You urge that this poetic turn Of mine, is not of such concern, As with your time to interfere A moment's space—'tis therefore clear For those essays you have no call, Which suit not your affairs at all. A time may come, perhaps you'll say, That I shall make a holiday, And have my vacant thoughts at large, The student's office to discharge— And can you such vile stuff peruse, Rather than serve domestic views, Return the visits of a friend, Or with your wife your leisure spend, Relax your mind, your limbs relieve, And for new toil new strength receive? From worldly cares you must estrange Your thoughts, and feel a perfect change; If to Parnassus you repair, And seek for your admission there. Me—(Whom a Grecian mother bore On that Pierian, where of yore Mnemosyne in love divine Brought forth to Jove the tuneful nine, Tho' sprung where genius reign'd with art, I grub'd up av'rice from my heart, And rather for applause than pay, Embrac'd the literary way) Yet as a writer and a wit, With some abatements they admit. What is his case then, do you think, Who toils for wealth, nor sleeps a wink, Preferring to the pleasing pain Of composition sordid gain? But hap what will (as See Virg. Æn. Sinon said, When to king Priam he was led) I book the third shall now fulfill, With Esop for my master still; Which book I dedicate to you, As both to worth and honour due— Pleas'd, if you read—if not, content As conscious of a sure event, That these my fables shall remain, And after-ages entertain. In a few words I now propose To point from whence the Fable rose. As servitude was all along Expos'd to most oppressive wrong, The suff'rer therefore did not dare, His heart's true dictates to declare; But couch'd his meaning in the veil Of many an allegoric tale, And jesting with a moral aim, Eluded all offence and blame. This is the path that I pursue, Inventing more than Esop knew, And It appears that Phædrus had been prosecuted by Sejanus for publishing something which he supposed to be levell'd at himself. certain topics by the by, To my own hindrance did I try. But was there any of mankind, Besides Sejanus so inclin'd, Who was alone to work my fall Informer, witness, judge and all; I would confess the slander true, And own such hardships were my due; Nor would I fly my grief to ease, To such poor lenitives as these. If any thro' suspicion errs, And to himself alone refers, What was design'd for thousands more He'll shew too plainly, where he's sore. Yet ev'n from such I crave excuse, For (far from personal abuse) My verse in gen'ral would put down True life and manners of the town. But here, perhaps, some one will ask Why I forsooth embrac'd this task? If Esop, tho' a Phrygian, rose, And ev'n deriv'd from Scythian snows If Anacharsis could devise, By wit to gain th'immortal prize; Shall I, who to learn'd Greece belong, Neglect her honour and her song, And by dull sloth myself disgrace? Since we can reckon up in Thrace, The authors that have sweetest sung, Where Linus from Apollo sprung; And Orpheus. he whose mother was a muse, Whose voice could tenderness infuse To solid rocks, strange monsters quell'd, And Hebrus in his course with-held. Envy, stand clear, or thou shalt rue Th'attack, for glory is my due. Thus having wrought upon your ear, I beg that you would be sincere; And in the poet's cause avow That candour, all the world allow. FABLE I. The Old Woman and Empty Cask. An ancient dame a firkin sees, In which the rich Falernian lees Send from the nobly tinctur'd shell A rare and most delicious smell! There when a season she had clung With greedy nostrils to the bung “O spirit exquisitely sweet “(She cried) how perfectly complete; “Was you of old and at the best, “When ev'n your dregs have such a zest!” They'll see the drift of this my rhime, Who knew the author in his prime. FABLE II. The Panther and Shepherds. Their scorn comes home to them again, Who treat the wretched with disdain. A careless Panther long ago Fell in a pit, which overthrow The Shepherds all around alarm'd; When some themselves with cudgels arm'd, Others threw stones upon its head; But some in pity sent her bread, As death was not the creature's due— The night came on—the hostile crew Went home, not doubting in the way To find the Panther dead next day. But she, recov'ring of her strength, Sprang from the pit and fled at length. But rushing in a little space From forth her den upon the place, She tears the flock, the Shepherd slays, And all the region round dismays. Then they began to be afraid, Who spar'd the beast and lent her aid; They reck not of the loss, but make Their pray'r for life, when thus she spake. “I will remember them that threw “The stones, and well remember you “Who gave me bread—Desist to fear, “For 'twas the oppressor brought me here.” FABLE III. The Ape's Head. A Certain person, as he stood Within the shambles buying food, Amongst the other kitchen-fare Beheld an Ape suspended there; And asking how 'twou'd taste, when drest? The butcher shook his head in jest; “If for such prog your fancy is, “Judge of the flavour by the phiz.” This speech was not so true as keen, For I in life have often seen Good features with a wicked heart, And plainness acting virtue's part. FABLE IV. Æsop and the insolent Fellow. Fools from success perdition meet.— An idle wretch about the street At Esop threw a stone in rage. “So much the better” (quoth the sage) And gives three farthings for the job. “I've no more money in my fob; “But if you'll follow my advice, “More shall be levied in a trice.” It happen'd that the self-same hour Came by a man of wealth and pow'r. “There throw your pellet at my lord, “And you shall have a sure reward!” The fellow did as he was told, But mark the downfall of the bold: His hopes are baulk'd, and lo! he gains A rope and gibbet for his pains. FABLE V. The Fly and the Mule. A Fly, that set upon the beam Rated the Mule—“Why sure you dream? “Pray get on faster with the cart “Or I shall sting you till you smart!”— She answers, “All this talk I hear “With small attention, but must fear “Him who upon the box sustains “The pliant whip, and holds the reins. “Cease then your pertness—for I know “When to give back, and when to go.” This tale derides the talking crew, Whose empty threats are all they do. FABLE VI. The Dog and the Wolf. I Will, as briefly as I may, The sweets of liberty display. A Wolf half famish'd, chanc'd to see A Dog, as fat as Dog could be: For one day meeting on the road, They mutual compliments bestow'd— “Prithee,” says Isgrim, faint and weak, “How came you so well fed and sleek? “I starve, tho' stronger of the two.” “It will be just as well with you (The Dog quite cool and frank reply'd) “If with my master you'll abide.” “For what?” “Why merely to attend, “And from night thieves the door defend.” “I gladly will accept the post, “What shall I bear with snow and frost, “And all this rough inclement plight, “Rather than have a home at night, “And feed on plenty at my ease? “Come then with me”—the Wolf agrees— But as they went the mark he found, Where the Dog's collar had been bound— “What's this my friend?” “Why nothing.” “Nay “Be more explicit, Sir, I pray.” “I'm somewhat fierce and apt to bite, “Therefore they hold me pretty tight, “That in the day-time I may sleep, “And night by night my vigils keep. “At ev'ningtide they let me out, “And then I freely walk about: “Bread comes without a care of mine, “I from my master's table dine; “The servants throw me many a scrap, “With choice of pot-liquor to lap— “So I've my belly-full, you find.”— “But can you go where you've a mind?” “Not always, to be flat and plain.” “Then, Dog, enjoy your post again, “For to remain this servile thing, “Old Isgrim would not be a king.” FABLE VII. The Brother and Sister. Warn'd by our council oft beware, And look into yourself with care. There was a certain father had A homely girl and comely lad. These being at their childish play Within their mother's room one day, A looking glass was in the chair, And they beheld their faces there. The boy grows prouder, as he looks, The girl is in a rage, nor brooks Her boasting brother's jests and sneers, Affronted at each word she hears; Then to her father down she flies, And urges all she can devise Against the boy, who could presume To meddle in a lady's room. At which, embracing each in turn With most affectionate concern, “My dears (he says) ye may not pass “A day without this useful glass, “You lest you spoil a pretty face, “By doing things to your disgrace— “You by good conduct to correct “Your form, and beautify defect.” FABLE VIII. A Saying of Socrates. Though common be the name of friend, Few can to faithfulness pretend. That Socrates (whose cruel case, I'd freely for his fame embrace, And living any envy bear To leave my character so fair) Was building of a little cot, When some one standing on the spot, Ask'd (as the folks are apt to do) How comes so great a man as you Content with such a little hole?— “I wish (says he) with all my soul “That this same little house I build, “Was with true friends completely fill'd.” FABLE IX. Of Doubt and Credulity. 'Tis frequently of bad event, To give or to with-hold assent. Two cases will th'affair explain— The good Hippolytus was slain, In that his stepdame credit found, And Troy was level'd with the ground; Because Cassandra's prescious care Sought, but obtain'd no credence there. The facts should then be very strong, Lest the weak judge determine wrong; But that I may not make too free With fabulous antiquity, I now a curious tale shall tell, Which I myself remember well. An honest man, that lov'd his wife, Was introducing into life A son upon the man's estate. One day a servant (whom of late, He with his freedom had endu'd) Took him aside, and being shrewd Suppos'd that he might be his heir, When he'd divulg'd the whole affair. Much did he lie against the youth, But more against the matron's truth, And hinted that, which worst of all Was sure a lover's heart to gall, The visits of a lusty rake, And honour of his house at stake. He at this scandal taking heat, Pretends a journey to his seat; But stopp'd at hand, while it was light, Where on a sudden, and by night, He to his wife's apartment sped, Where she had put the lad to bed, As watchful of his youthful bloom— While now they're running to the room, And seek a light in haste, the sire, No longer stifling of his ire; Flies to the couch, where groping round A head, but newly shav'd, he found; Then as alone, he vengeance breath'd, The sword within his bosom sheath'd— The candle ent'ring, when he spy'd The bleeding youth, and by his side The spotless dame, who being fast Asleep, knew nothing that had past, Instant in utmost grief involv'd, He vengeance for himself resolv'd, And on that very weapon flew, Which his too cred'lous fury drew. Th'accusers take the woman straight, And drag to the centumvirate: Th'ill-natur'd world directly built A strong suspicion of her guilt, As she th'estate was to enjoy— The lawyers all their skill employ, And a great spirit those exert, Who most her innocence assert. The judges then to Cæsar pray'd That he would lend his special aid, Who as they acted upon oath, Declar'd themselves extremely loth To close this intricate affair— He taking then himself the chair, The clouds of calumny displac'd, And truth up to her fountain trac'd. “Let the freed-man to vengeance go, “The cause of all this scene of woe. “For the poor widow thus undone, “Depriv'd of husband and of son, “To pity has a greater plea “Than condemnation, I decree— “But if the man, with caution due, “Had rather blam'd than listen'd to “The vile accuser, and his lie “Had strictly search'd with reason's eye, “This desp'rate guilt he had not known, “Nor branch and root his house o'erthrown.” Nor wholly scorn, nor yet attend Too much at what the tatlers vend, Because there's many a sad neglect, Where you have little to suspect, And treach'rous persons will attaint Men, against whom there's no complaint. Hence simple folks too may be taught How to form judgments as they ought, And not see with another's glass; For things are come to such a pass, That love and hate work diff'rent ways, As int'rest or ambition sways. Them you may know, in them confide, Whom by experience you have try'd. Thus have I made a long amends, For that brief style which some offends. FABLE X. The Eunuch and Wicked Fellow. An Eunuch, upon some dispute, Was wrangling with a noisy brute, Who with bad words and much offence, Urg'd his privation—“'Tis from thence “(Says he) that I must leisure find “The more to cultivate my mind, “Because my mortal part is maim'd— “But why is my misfortune blam'd? “That only is disgrace in grain, “Which men by their demerit gain.” FABLE XI. The Cock and the Pearl. A Cock while scratching all around, A Pearl upon the dunghill found. “O splendid thing in foul disgrace, “Had there been any in the place “That saw and knew thy worth, when sold, “Ere this thou hadst been set in gold. “But I, who rather would have got “A corn of barley, heed thee not; “No service can there render'd be “From me to you, and you to me.” I write this tale to them alone, To whom in vain my pearls are thrown. FABLE XII. The Bees and the Drones. Up in a lofty oak the Bees Had made their honey-combs—but these The Drones asserted they had wrought. Then to the bar the cause was brought Before the wasp a learned chief, Who well might argue either brief, As of a middle nature made. He therefore to both parties said— “You're not dissimilar in size, “And each with each your colour vies; “That there's a doubt concerning both: “But lest I err upon my oath, “Hives for yourselves directly chuse, “And in the wax the work infuse, “That from the flavour and the form, “We may point out the genuine swarm.” The Drones refuse, the Bees agree— Then thus did justice wasp decree— “Who can, and who cannot is plain, “So take, ye Bees, your combs again.” This narrative had been supprest, Had not the Drones refus'd the test. FABLE XIII. Esop playing. As Esop was with boys at play, And had his nuts as well as they, A grave Athenian passing by, Cast on the sage a scornful eye, As on a dotard quite bereav'd— Which when the moralist perceiv'd, (Rather himself a wit profest Than the poor subject of a jest) Into the publick way he flung A bow that he had just unstrung: “There solve, thou conjurer, he cries, “The problem, that before thee lies.” The people throng—he racks his brain, Nor can the thing enjoin'd explain. At last he gives it up—the seer Thus then in triumph made it clear. “As the tough bow exerts its spring, “A constant tension breaks the string; “But if 'tis let at seasons loose, “You may depend upon its use.” Thus recreative sports and play, Are good upon a holiday, And with more spirit they'll pursue The studies which they shall renew. FABLE XIV. The Dog and the Lamb. A Dog bespoke a sucking Lamb, That us'd a she-goat as her dam, “You little fool, why how you baà, “This goat is not your own mamma:” Then pointed to a distant mead, Where several sheep were put to feed. “I ask not (says the Lamb) for her “Who had me first at nature's spur, “And bore me for a time about, “Then, like a fardel, threw me out; “But her that is content to bilk “Her own dear kids, to give me milk.” “Yet she that yean'd you sure, says Tray, “Should be preferr'd”—“I tell thee nay— “Whence could she know that what she hid “Was black or white—but grant she did— “I being thus a male begot “'Twas no great favour, since my lot “Was hour by hour throughout my life, “To dread the butcher and his knife. “Why should I therefore give my voice, “For he who had no pow'r or choice “In my production, and not cleave “To her so ready to relieve, “When she beheld me left alone, “And has such sweet indulgence shewn?” Kind deeds parental love proclaim, Not mere necessity and name. FABLE XV. The Owl and the Grashopper. Those who will not the forms obey To be obliging in their way, Must often punishment abide For their ill-nature, and their pride. A Grashopper, in rank ill-will, Was very loud and very shrill Against a sapient Owl's repose, Who was compell'd by day to doze Within an hollow oak's retreat, As wont by night to quest for meat— She is desir'd to hold her peace, But at the word her cries increase; Again requested to abate Her noise, she's more importunate. The Owl perceiving no redress, And that her words were less and less Accounted of, no longer pray'd, But thus an artifice essay'd. “Since 'tis impossible to nod, “While harping like the Delphian God, “You charm our ears, stead of a nap, “A batch of nectar will I tap, “Which lately from Minerva came; “Now if you do not scorn the same, “Together let us bumpers ply.” The Grashopper, extremely dry, And, finding she had hit the key That gain'd applause, approach'd with glee; At which the Owl upon her flew, And quick the trembling vixen slew. Thus by her death she was adjudg'd, To give what in her life she grudg'd. FABLE XVI. The Trees protected. The Gods took certain trees (th'affair Was some time since) into their care. The oak was best approv'd by Jove, The myrtle by the queen of love; The god of musick and the day, Vouchsaf'd to patronize the bay; The pine Cybele chanc'd to please, And the tall poplar Hercules. Minerva upon this enquir'd Why they all barren trees admir'd? “The cause (says Jupiter) is plain, “Lest we give honour up for gain.” “Let every one their fancy suit, “I chuse the olive for its fruit.” The sire of gods and men replies, Daughter, thou shalt be reckon'd wise By all the world, and justly too. For whatsoever things we do, If not a life of useful days, How vain is all pretence to praise! Whate'er experiments you try, Have some advantage in your eye. FABLE XVII. Juno and the Peacock. Her fav'rite bird to Juno came, And was in dudgeon at the dame, That she had not attun'd her throat With Philomela's matchless note: “She is the wonder of all ears, “But when I speak the audience sneers.” The goddess to the bird reply'd, (Willing to have him pacify'd) “You are above the rest endu'd “With beauty and with magnitude, “Your neck the em'rald's gloss outvies, “And what a blaze of gemmeous dies “Shines from the plumage of your tail?” “All this dumb show will not avail, “Cries he, if I'm surpass'd in voice.” “The fates intirely have the choice “Of all the lots—fair form is yours; “The eagle's strength his prey secures; “The nightingale can sing an ode; “The crow and raven may forebode: “All these in sheer contentment crave “No other voice than nature gave.” By affectation be not sway'd, Where nature has not lent her aid; Nor to that flatt'ring hope attend, Which must in disappointment end. FABLE XVIII. Esop and the importunate Fellow. Esop (no other slave at hand) Receiv'd himself his lord's command An early supper to provide. From house to house he therefore try'd To beg the favour of a light, At length he hit upon the right. But as when first he sallied out, He made his tour quite round about, On his return he took a race Directly cross the market place. When thus a talkative buffoon, “Esop, what means this light at noon?” He answer'd briefly, as he ran, “Fellow, I'm looking for a man.” Now if this jackanapes had weigh'd The true intent of what was said, He'd found that Esop had no sense Of manhood in impertinence. FABLE XIX. The Ass and Priests of Cybele. The luckless wretch that's born to woe, Must all his life affliction know— And harder still, his cruel fate Will on his very ashes wait. Cybele's priests, in quest of bread, An Ass about the village led, With things for sale from door to door; Till work'd and beaten more and more, At length, when the poor creature dy'd, They made them drums out of his hide. Then question'd how it came to pass They thus could serve their darling Ass? The answer was, “He thought of peace “In death, and that his toils would cease; “But see his mis'ry knows no bounds, “Still with our blows his back resounds.” The End of the Third Book. THE FOURTH BOOK OF THE FABLES of PHÆDRUS. Prologue. [To you, who've graver things bespoke] To you, who've graver things bespoke, This seems no better than a joke, And light for mere amusement made; Yet still we drive the scribbling trade, And from the pen our pleasure find: When we've no greater things to mind. Yet if you look with care intense, These tales your toil shall recompense; Appearance is not always true, And thousands err by such a view. 'Tis a choice spirit that has pry'd Where clean contrivance chose to hide; That this is not at random said, I shall produce upon this head A fable of an arch device, About the Weasel and the Mice. FABLE I. The Weasel and Mice. A Weasel, worn with years and lame, That could not overtake its game, Now with the nimble Mice to deal, Disguis'd herself with barley meal; Then negligent her limbs she spread In a sly nook, and lay for dead. A Mouse that thought she there might feed, Leapt up and perish'd in the deed; A second in like manner dy'd; A third, and sundry more beside: Then comes the brindled Mouse, a chap That oft escap'd both snare and trap, And seeing how the trick was play'd, Thus to his crafty foe he said.— “So may'st thou prosper day and night, “As thou art not an errant bite.” FABLE II. The Fox and the Grapes. An hungry Fox with fierce attack Sprang on a Vine, but tumbled back, Nor could attain the point in view, So near the sky the bunches grew. As he went off, “They're scurvy stuff “(Says he) and not half ripe enough— “And I've more rev'rence for my tripes, “Than to torment them with the gripes.” For those this tale is very pat, Who lessen what they can't come at. FABLE III. The Horse and Boar. A Wild-Boar wallow'd in the flood, And troubled all the stream with mud, Just where a horse to drink repair'd— He therefore having war declar'd, Sought man's alliance for the fight, And bore upon his back the knight; Who being skill'd his darts to throw, Dispatch'd the Wild-Boar at a blow. Then to the Steed the victor said, “I'm glad you came to me for aid, “For taught how useful you can be, “I've got at once a spoil and thee.” On which the fields he made him quit, To feel the spur and champ the bit. Then he his sorrow thus express'd, “I needs must have my wrongs redress'd, “And making tyrant man the judge, “Must all my life become a drudge.” This tale the passionate may warn, To bear with any kind of scorn; And rather all complaint withdraw, Then either go to war or law. FABLE IV. Esop and the Will. That one man sometimes is more shrewd Than a stupendous multitude, To after-times I shall rehearse, In my concise familiar verse. A certain man on his decease, Left his three girls so much a-piece: The first was beautiful and frail, With eyes still hunting for the male; The second giv'n to spin and card, A country house-wife working hard; The third but very ill to pass, A homely slut, that lov'd her glass. The dying man had left his wife Executrix, and for her life Sole tenant, if she should fulfill These strange provisoes of his will. “That she should give th'estate in fee, “In equal portions to the three; “But in such sort, that this bequest “Should not be holden or possest; “Then soon as they should be bereav'n “Of all the substance that was giv'n, “They must for their good mother's ease, “Make up an hundred sesterces.” This spread through Athens in a trice; The prudent widow takes advice. But not a lawyer could unfold How they should neither have nor hold The very things that they were left. Besides, when once they were bereft, How they from nothing should confer The money that was due to her. When a long time was spent in vain, And no one could the will explain She left the councellors unfeed, And thus of her own self decreed. The eunuchs, trinkets, plate, and dress, She gave the harlot to possess. Then Mrs. Notable she stocks With all the fields, the kine and flocks: The workmen, farm, with a supply Of all the tools of husbandry. Last to the guzler she consigns, The cellar stor'd with good old wines, A handsome house to see a friend, With pleasant gardens at the end. Thus as she strove th'affair to close, By giving each the things they chose, And those that knew them every one, Highly applauded what was done; Esop arose and thus address'd The croud that to his presence press'd. “O that the dead could yet perceive! “How would the prudent father grieve, “That all th'Athenians had not skill “Enough to understand his will.” Then at their joint request he solv'd That error, which had all involv'd. “The gardens, house, and wine-vaults too, “Give to the spinster as her due; “The cloaths, the jewels, and such ware, “Be all the tippling lady's share; “The fields, the barns, and flocks of sheep, “Give the gay courtezan to keep. “Not one will bear the very touch “Of things that thwart their tastes so much; “The slut to fill her cellar straight “Her wardrobe will evacuate; “The harlot soon will sell her farms, “For garments to set off her charms; “But she that loves the flocks and kine, “Will alienate her stores of wine, “Her rustic genius to employ. “Thus none their portions shall enjoy, “And from the money each has made, “Their mother shall be duly paid.” Thus one man by his wit disclos'd The point, that had so many pos'd. FABLE V. The Battle of the Mice and Weasels. The routed Mice upon a day, Fled from the Weasels in array; But in the hurry of the flight, What with their weakness and their fright, Each scarce could get into his cave; Howe'er at last their lives they save. But their commanders (who had ty'd Horns to their heads in martial pride, Which as a signal they design'd For non-commission'd mice to mind) Stick in the entrance as they go, And there are taken by the foe, Who greedy of the victim gluts, With Mouse-flesh his ungodly guts. Each great and national distress, Must chiefly mighty men oppress; While folks subordinate and poor, Are by their littleness secure. FABLE VI. Phædrus to the Cavillers. Thou that against my tales inveigh'st As much too pleasant for thy taste; Egregious critic, cease to scoff, While for a time I play you off, And strive to sooth your puny rage. As Esop comes upon the stage, And dress'd intirely new in Rome, Thus enters with the tragic plume.— “O that the fair Thessalian pine, “Had never felt the wrath divine, “And fearless of the ax's wound, “Had still the Pelian mountain crown'd! “That It is necessary to mention here, what is not to be found in the dictionary, that Argus is the name of the ship-wright. Argus by Palladian aid, “Had ne'er th'advent'rous vessel made; “In which at first without dismay, “Death's bold professors won their way, “In which th'inhospitable main “Was first laid open for the bane “Of Grecians and Barbarians too. “Which made the proud Æetas rue, “And whence Medea's crimes to nought, “The house and reign of Pelias brought. “She—while in various forms she tries “Her furious spirit to disguise, “At one place in her flight bestow'd “Her brother's limbs upon the road; “And at another could betray “The daughters their own sire to slay.” How think you now?—What errant trash? And our assertions much too rash?— Since prior to th'Ægean fleet, Did Minos piracy defeat, And made adventures on the sea. How then shall you and I agree? Since stern as Cato's self you hate All tales alike, both small and great. Plague not too much the man of parts; For he that does it surely smarts.— This threat is to the fools, that squeam At every thing of good esteem; And that they may to taste pretend, Ev'n heav'n itself will discommend. FABLE VII. The Viper and the File. He that a greater biter bites, His folly on himself requites, As we shall manifest forthwith.— There was a hovel of a smith, Where a poor Viper chanc'd to steal, And being greedy of a meal, When she had seiz'd upon a file, Was answer'd in this rugged style. “Why do you think, O stupid Snake, “On me your usual meal to make, “Who've sharper teeth than thine by far, “And can corrode an iron bar?” FABLE VIII. The Fox and the Goat. A Crafty knave will make escape, When once he gets into a scrape, Still meditating self-defence, At any other man's expence. A Fox by some distaster fell Into a deep and fenced well. A thirsty Goat came down in haste, And ask'd about the water's taste, If it was plentiful and sweet? At which the Fox, in rank deceit, “So great the solace of the run, “I thought I never should have done. “Be quick, my friend, your sorrows drown.” This said, the silly Goat comes down. The subtle Fox herself avails, And by his horns the mound she scales, And leaves the Goat in all the mire, To gratify his heart's desire. FABLE IX. The Two Bags. Great Jove, in his paternal care, Has giv'n a man two Bags to bear, That which his own default contains, Behind his back unseen remains; But that which others vice attests, Swags full in view before our breasts. Hence we're inevitably blind, Relating to the Bag behind; But when our neighbours mis-demean, Our censures are exceeding keen. FABLE X. The sacrilegious Thief. A Villain to Jove's altar came To light his candle in the flame, And robb'd the God in dead of night, By his own consecrated light. Then thus an awful voice was sent, As with the sacrilege he went. “Tho' all this gold and silver plate “Were gifts of evil men I hate, “That their removal from the fane “Can cause the Deity no pain; “Yet, caitiff, at th'appointed time, “Thy life shall answer for thy crime. “But, for the future, lest this blaze, “At which the pious pray and praise, “Should guide the wicked, I decree “That no such intercourse there be.” Hence to this day all men decline To light their candle at the shrine; Nor from a candle e'er presume The holy-light to re-illume. How many things are here contain'd, By him alone can be explain'd, Who could this useful tale invent. In the first place, herein is meant, That they are often most your foes, Who from your fost'ring hand arose. Next, that the harden'd villain's fate Is not from wrath precipitate, But rather at a destin'd hour. Lastly, we're charg'd, with all our pow'r, To keep ourselves, by care intense, From all connections with offence. FABLE XI. Hercules and Plutus. Wealth by the brave is justly scorn'd, Since men are from the truth suborn'd, And a full chest perverts their ways From giving or deserving praise. When Hercules, for matchless worth, Was taken up to heav'n from earth, As in their turns to all the crowd Of gratulating Gods he bow'd, When Plutus, fortune's son, he spies, He from his face averts his eyes. Jove ask'd the cause of this disgust: “I hate him, as he is unjust, “To wicked men the most inclin'd, “And grand corrupter of mankind.” FABLE XII. The He-Goats and She-Goats. When the She-goats from Jove obtain'd A beard, th'indignant males complain'd, That females by this near approach Would on their gravity encroach. Suffer, my sapient friends, says he, Their eminence in this degree, And bear their beard's most graceful length, As they can never have your strength. Warn'd by this little tale agree With men in gen'ral form'd like thee, While you by virtue still exceed, And in the spirit take the lead. FABLE XIII. The Pilot and Sailors. On hearing a poor man lament His worldly thoughts in discontent, Esop this tale began to write, For consolation and delight. The ship by furious tempests tost, The Mariners gave all for lost; But midst their tears and dread, the scene Is chang'd at once, and all serene. The wind is fair, the vessel speeds, The Sailors boist'rous joy exceeds: The Pilot then by peril wise, Was prompted to philosophize. “'Tis right to put a due restraint “On joy, and to retard complaint; “Because alternate hope and fright “Make up our lives of black and white.” FABLE XIV. The Man and the Adder. He, that malicious men relieves, His folly in a season grieves. A Man, against himself humane, Took up an Adder, that had lain And stiffen'd in the frosty air, And in his bosom plac'd with care, Where she with speed recov'ring breath, Her benefactor stung to death. Another Adder near the place, On asking why she was so base, Was told, “'Tis others to dissuade, “From giving wickedness their aid.” FABLE XV. The Fox and the Dragon. A Fox was throwing up the soil, And while with his assiduous toil He burrow'd deep into the ground, A Dragon in his den he found, A watching hidden treasure there, Whom seeing, Reynard speaks him fair: “First for your pardon I apply “For breaking on your privacy; “Then, as you very plainly see “That gold is of no use to me, “Your gentle leave let me obtain “To ask you, what can be the gain “Of all this care, and what the fruit “That you should not with sleep recruit “Your spirits, but your life consume “Thus in an everlasting gloom?” “'Tis not my profit here to stay “(He cries) but I must Jove obey.” “What will you therefore nothing take “Yourself, nor others welcome make?” “Ev'n so the fates decree.”—“Then, Sir, “Have patience, whilst I do aver, “That he who like affections knows “Is born with all the Gods his foes. “Since to that place you needs must speed, “Where all your ancestors precede, “Why in the blindness of your heart, “Do you torment your noble part?” All this to thee do I indite Thou grudging churl, thy heir's delight! Who rob'st the Gods of incense due, Thyself of food and raiment too; Who hear'st the harp with sullen mien, To whom the piper gives the spleen; Who'rt full of heavy groans and sighs When in their price provisions rise; Who with thy frauds heav'ns patience tire To make thy heap a little high'r, And, lest death thank thee, in thy will Has tax'd the undertaker's bill. FABLE XVI. Phædrus of his Fables. What certain envious hearts intend I very clearly comprehend, Let them dissemble e'er so much.— When they perceive the master's touch, And find 'tis likely to endure, They'll say 'tis Esop to be sure— But what appears of mean design, At any rate they'll vouch for mine. These in a word I would refute: Whether of great or no repute, What sprung from Esop's fertile thought, This hand has to perfection brought; But waving things to our distaste, Let's to the destin'd period haste. FABLE XVII. The Shipwreck of Simonides. A Man, whose learned worth is known, Has always riches of his own. Simonides, who was the head Of Lyric bards, yet wrote for bread, His circuit took through every town In Asia of the first renown, The praise of heroes to rehearse, Who gave him money for his verse. When by this trade much wealth was earn'd, Homewards by shipping he return'd (A Cean born, as some suppose) Aboard he went, a tempest rose, Which shook th'old ship to that degree, She founder'd soon as out at sea. Some purses, some their jewels tie About them for a sure supply; But one more curious ask'd the seer, Poet, have you got nothing here? “My all, says he, is what I am.”— On this some few for safety swam, (For most o'erburthend by their goods, Were smother'd in the whelming floods.) The spoilers came, the wealth demand, And leave them naked on the strand. It happen'd for the shipwreck'd crew An ancient city was in view, By name Clazomena, in which There liv'd a scholar learn'd and rich, Who often read, his cares to ease, The verses of Simonides, And was a vast admirer grown Of this great poet, though unknown. Him by his converse when he trac'd, He with much heartiness embrac'd, And soon equipp'd the bard a-new, With servants, cloaths, and money too. The rest benevolence implor'd, With case depicted on a board: Which when Simonides espy'd, “I plainly told you all, he cry'd, “That all my wealth was in myself; “As for your chattels and your pelf, “On which ye did so much depend, “They're come to nothing in the end” FABLE XVIII. The Mountain in Labour. The Mountain labour'd, groaning loud, On which a num'rous gaping crowd Of noodles came to see the sight, When lo! a mouse was brought to light! This tale's for men of swagg'ring cast, Whose threats, voluminous and vast, With all their verse and all their prose, Can make but little on't, God knows. FABLE XIX. The Ant and the Fly. An Ant and Fly had sharp dispute Which creature was of most repute? When thus began the flanting Fly— “Are you so laudable as I? “I, ere the sacrifice is carv'd, “Precede the Gods; first come, first serv'd— “Before the altar take my place, “And in all temples shew my face. “Whene'er I please I set me down “Upon the head that wears a crown. “I with impunity can taste “The kiss of matrons fair and chaste, “And pleasure without labour claim— “Say, trollop, can'st thou do the same?” ‘The feasts of Gods are glorious fare, ‘No doubt, to those who're welcome there; ‘But not for such detested things— ‘You talk of matron's lips and kings; ‘I, who with wakeful care and pains ‘Against the winter hoard my grains, ‘Thee feeding upon ordure view— ‘The altars you frequent, 'tis true; ‘But still are driv'n away from thence, ‘And elsewhere, as of much offence. ‘A life of toil you will not lead, ‘And so have nothing, when you need. ‘Besides all this, you talk with pride ‘On things that modesty should hide. ‘You plague me here, while days increase, ‘But when the winter comes you cease. ‘Me, when the cold thy life bereaves, ‘A plenteous magazine receives. ‘I think I need no more advance, ‘To cure you of your arrogance.’ The tenor of this tale infers Two very diff'rent characters; Of men self-prais'd and falsely vain, And men of real worth in grain. FABLE XX. The Escape of Simonides. Th' attention letters can engage, Ev'n from a base degen'rate age, I've shewn before; and now shall shew Their lustre in another view, And tell a memorable tale, How much they can with heav'n prevail. Simonides, the very same We lately had a call to name, Agreed for such a sum to blaze A certain famous champion's praise. He therefore a retirement sought, But found the theme on which he wrote So scanty, he was forc'd to use Th'accustom'd licence of the muse, And introduc'd and praise bestow'd On Leda's sons to raise his ode; With these the rather making free, As heroes in the same degree. He warranted his work, and yet Could but one third of payment get. Upon demanding all the due, Let them (says he) pay t'other two, Who take two places in the song; But lest you think I do you wrong, And part in dudgeon—I invite Your company to sup this night, For then my friends and kin I see, 'Mongst which I chuse to reckon thee. Chous'd and chagrin'd, yet shunning blame, He promis'd, set the hour, and came; As fearful lest a favour spurn'd Should to an open breach be turn'd. The splendid banquet shone with plate, And preparations full of state, Made the glad house with clamours roar— When on a sudden at the door Two youths, with sweat and dust besmear'd, Above the human form appear'd, And charg'd forthwith a little scout To bid Simonides come out, That 'twas his in'trest not to stay— The slave, in trouble and dismay, Rous'd from his seat the feasting bard, Who scarce had stirr'd a single yard, Before the room at once fell in, And crush'd the champion and his kin. No youths before the door are found— The thing soon spread the country round; And when each circumstance was weigh'd, They knew the Gods that visit made, And sav'd the Poet's life, in lieu Of those two thirds which yet were due. Epilogue to Eutychus. I Yet have stock in hand to spare, And could write on—but will forbear— First lest I tire a friend, whose state And avocations are so great: And then, if other pens should try This moral scheme as well as I, They may have something to persue— Yet if the spacious field we view, More men are wanting for the plan, Rather than matter for the man. Now for that prize I make my plea You promis'd to my brevity. Keep your kind word; for life, my friend, Is daily nearer to its end: And I shall share your love the less The longer you your hand repress; The sooner you the boon ensure, The more the tenure must endure; And if I quick possession take, The greater profit must I make. While yet declining age subsists, A room for friendly aid exists. Anon with tasteless years grown weak, In vain benevolence will seek To do me good—when death at hand Shall come and urge his last demand. 'Tis folly, you'll be apt to say, A thousand times to beg and pray Of one with so much worth and sense, Whose gen'rous bounty is propense. If e'er a miscreant succeeds, By fair confession of his deeds, An innocent offender's case Is far more worthy of your grace. You for example's sake begin, Then others to the lure you'll win, And in rotation more and more Will soon communicate their store. Consider in your mind how far At stake your word and honour are; And let your closing the debate Be what I may congratulate. I have been guilty of excess Beyond my thought in this address; But 'tis not easy to refrain, A spirit work'd up to disdain By wretches insolent and vile, With a clear conscience all the while. You'll ask me, Sir, at whom I hint— In time they may appear in print. But give me leave to cite a phrase I met with in my boyish days. “'Tis dang'rous for the mean and low “Too plain their grievances to shew.” This is advice I shall retain, While life and sanity remain. The End of the Fourth Book. THE FIFTH BOOK OF THE FABLES of PHÆDRUS. Prologue to Particulo. When I resolv'd my hand to stay For this, that others might have play On reconsid'ring of my part, I soon recanted in my heart. For if a rival should arise, How can he possibly devise The things that I have let alone, Since each man's fancy is his own, And likewise colouring of the piece?— It was not therefore mere caprice, But strong reflexion made me write— Wherefore since you in tales delight, Which I in justice, after all, Not Esop's, but Esopian call; Since he invented but a few, I more, and some intirely new, Keeping indeed the ancient style, With fresh materials all the while. As at your leisure you peruse The fourth collection of my muse, That you may not be at a stand, A fifth shall shortly come to hand; 'Gainst which, if as against the rest, Malignant cavillers protest, Let them carp on, and make it plain They carp at what they can't attain. My fame's secure, since I can shew How men of eminence, like you, My little book transcribe and quote, As like to live of classic note. It is th'ambition of my pen To win th'applause of learned men. FABLE I. Demetrius and Menander. If Esop's name at any time I bring into this measur'd rhime, To whom I've paid whate'er I owe, Let all men by these presents know, I with th'old fabulist make free, To strengthen my authority. As certain sculptors of the age, The more attention to engage, And raise their price, the curious please, By forging of Praxiteles; And in like manner they purloin A Myro to their silver coin. 'Tis thus our fables we can smoke, As pictures for their age bespoke. For biting envy, in disgust To new improvements, favours rust; But now a tale comes in of course, Which these assertions will inforce. Demetrius, who was justly call'd The tyrant, got himself install'd, And held o'er Athens impious sway. The crowd, as ever is the way, Came eager rushing far and wide, And, fortunate event! they cry'd. The nobles came, the throne address'd: The hand by which they were oppress'd They meekly kiss'd, with inward stings Of anguish for the face of things. The idlers also, with the tribe Of those who to themselves prescribe Their ease and pleasure, in the end Came sneaking, lest they should offend. Amongst this troop Menander hies So famous for his comedies. (Him, though he was not known by sight, The tyrant read with great delight, Struck with the genius of the bard) In flowing robes bedaub'd with nard, And saunt'ring tread he came along, Whom, at the bottom of the throng, When Phalereus beheld, he said, How dar'd that fribble shew his head In this our presence?—he was told, “It is Menander you behold.” Then chang'd at once from fierce to bland, He call'd, and took him by the hand. FABLE II. The Thief and the Travellers. Two men equipp'd were on their way, One fearful, one without dismay An able fencer—As they went, A robber came with black intent, Demanding, upon pain of death, Their gold and silver in a breath. At which the man of spirit drew, And instantly disarm'd and slew The Thief, his honour to maintain— Soon as the rogue was fairly slain, The tim'rous chap began to puff, And drew his sword, and stripp'd in buff— “Leave me alone with him, stand back, “I'll teach him whom he should attack.” Then he who fought, “I wish, my friend, “But now you'd had such words to lend; “I might have been confirm'd the more, “Supposing truth to all you swore, “Then put your weapon in the sheath, “And keep your tongue within your teeth, “Tho' you may play an actor's part, “On them who do not know your heart, “I, who have seen this very day “How lustily you run away, “Experience, when one comes to blows, “How far your resolution goes.” This narrative to those I tell, Who stand their ground, when all is well; But in the hour of pressing need Abash'd, most shamefully recede. FABLE III. The Bald Man and the Fly. As on his head she chanc'd to sit, A man's bald-pate a gad-fly bit; He, prompt to crush the little foe, Dealt on himself a grievous blow. At which the fly deriding said, You that would strike an insect dead For one slight sting, in wrath so strict, What punishment will you inflict Upon yourself, who was so blunt To do yourself this gross affront?— O (says the party) as for me, I with myself can soon agree. The spirit of th'intention's all; But thou, detested canibal, Blood-sucker, to have thee secur'd, More would I gladly have endur'd. What by this moral tale is meant Is—those who wrong not with intent Are venial; but to those that do Severity, I think, is due. FABLE IV. The Man and the Ass. A Certain man, when he had made A sacrifice, for special aid To Hercules, and kill'd a swine, Did for his Ass's share assign All the remainder of the corn; But he rejecting it with scorn, Thus said, “I gladly would partake— “But apprehend that life's at stake; “For he you fatted up and fed “With store of this, is stuck and dead.” Struck with the import of this tale, I have succeeded to prevail Upon my passions, and abstain From peril of immod'rate gain. But, you will say, those that have come Unjustly by a handsome sum, Upon the pillage still subsist— Why, if we reckon up the list, You'll find by far the major part Have been conducted in the cart: Temerity for some may do, But many more their rashness rue. FABLE V. The Buffoon and Country-Fellow. In ev'ry age, in each profession, Men err the most by prepossession; But when the thing is clearly shown, Is fairly urg'd, and fully known, We soon applaud what we deride, And penitence succeeds to pride. A certain noble, on a day, Having a mind to shew away, Invited by reward the mimes And play'rs and tumblers of the times, And built a large commodious stage For the choice spirits of the age; But above all, amongst the rest There came a genius, who profest To have a curious trick in store, That never was perform'd before. Thro' all the town this soon got air, And the whole house was like a fair; But soon his entry as he made, Without a prompter or parade, 'Twas all expectance and suspence, And silence gag'd the audience. He, stooping down and looking big, So wond'rous well took off a pig, All swore 'twas serious, and no joke, For that, or underneath his cloak He had conceal'd some grunting elf, Or was a real hog himself. A search was made—no pig was found— With thund'ring claps the seats resound, And pit, and box, and gall'ries roar With—O rare! bravo! and encore! Old Roger Grouse, a country clown, Who yet knew something of the town, Beheld the mimic of his whim, And on the morrow challeng'd him, Declaring to each beau and belle That he this grunter would excell. The morrow came—the crowd was greater— But prejudice and rank ill-nature Usurp'd the minds of men and wenches, Who came to hiss and break the benches. The mimic took his usual station, And squeak'd with gen'ral approbation, Again encore! encore! they cry— 'Tis quite the thing, 'tis very high. Old Grouse conceal'd amidst this racket, A real pig beneath his jacket— Then forth he came, and with his nail, He pinch'd the urchin by the tail. The tortur'd pig, from out his throat, Produc'd the genuine nat'ral note. All bellow'd out 'twas very sad! Sure never stuff was half so bad! That like a pig! each cry'd in scoff, Pshaw! nonsense! blockhead! off! off! off! The mimic was extoll'd, and Grouse Was hiss'd and catcall'd from the house. Soft ye, a word before I go, Quoth honest Hodge, and stooping low, Produc'd the pig, and thus aloud, Bespoke the stupid partial crowd, “Behold and learn from this poor crater, “How much you critics know of nature.” To Particulo. As yet my muse is not to seek, But can from fresh materials speak; And our poetic fountain springs, With rich variety of things. But you're for sallies short and sweet; Long tales their purposes defeat. Wherefore, thou worthiest best of men, Particulo, for whom my pen Immortal honour will ensure, Long as a rev'rence shall endure For Roman learning—if this strain, Cannot your approbation gain, Yet, yet my brevity admire, Which may the more to praise aspire, The more our poets now a-days Are tedious in their lifeless lays. FABLE VI. The Two Bald Men. As on his way a bald-pate went, He found a comb by accident; Another, with a head as bare, Persu'd, and hollow'd for a share. The first produc'd the prize, and cry'd, “Good providence was on our side; “But by the strange caprice of fate, “We're to no purpose fortunate, “And (as the proverb says) have found “A hob-nail, for a hundred pound.” They by this tale may be reliev'd, Whose sanguine hopes have been deceiv'd. FABLE VII. Prince the Piper. A Little, friv'lous, abject mind, Pleas'd with the rabble, puft with wind, When once, as fast as pride presumes, Itself with vanity it plumes, Is by fond lightness brought with ease To any ridicule you please. One Prince, a Piper to the play, Was rather noted in his way, As call'd upon to shew his art, Whene'er A noted dancer and mimic. Bathyllus did his part. He being at a certain fair, (I do not well remember where) While they pull'd down the booth in haste, Not taking heed his leg displac'd, He from the scaffold fell so hard— ( There is a pun in the original, upon the word Tibia, which signifies both the shin-bone and a musical pipe.Would he his pipes had rather marr'd! Tho' they, poor fellow! were to him, As dear almost as life and limb.) Borne by the kind officious crowd, Home he's conducted, groaning loud. Some months elaps'd before he found Himself recover'd of his wound, Meantime, according to their way, The droll frequenters of the play Had a great miss of him, whose touch The dancers spirits rais'd so much. A certain man of high renown, Was just preparing for the town Some games the mob to entertain, When Prince began to walk again; Whom, what with bribes and pray'rs, his Grace Prevail'd upon to shew his face In this performance, by all means— And while he waits behind the scenes, A rumour thro' the house is spread, By certain “that the Piper's dead.” Others cry'd out, “The man is here, “And will immediately appear.” The curtain draws, the lightnings flash, The Gods speak out their usual trash. An ode, not to the Piper known, Was to the chorus-leader shown, Which he was order'd to repeat, And which was clos'd with this conceit— Receive with joy, O loyal Rome, Thy Prince just rescu'd from his tomb. They all at once stand up and clap, At which my most facetious chap, Kisses his hand, and scrapes, and bows To his good patrons in the house. First the Equestrian order smoke The fool's mistake, and high in joke, Command the song to be encor'd, Which ended, flat upon the board The Piper falls, the knights acclaim; The people think that Prince's aim Is for a crown of bays at least. Now all the seats perceiv'd the jest, And with his bandage white as snow, White frock, white pumps, a perfect beau, Proud of the feats he had atchiev'd, And these high honours he receiv'd With one unanimous huzza, Poor Prince was kick'd out of the play. FABLE VIII. Opportunity. Bald, naked, of a human shape, With fleet wings ready to escape, Upon a razor's edge his toes, And lock that on his forehead grows— Him hold, when seiz'd for goodness-sake, For Jove himself cannot retake The fugitive when once he's gone. The picture that we here have drawn, Is Opportunity so brief.— The ancients, in a bass relief, Thus made an effigy of time, That every one might use their prime; Nor e'er impede, by dull delay, Th'effectual business of to-day. FAB. IX. The Bull and the Calf. A Bull was struggling to secure His passage at a narrow door, And scarce could reach the rack of hay, His horns so much were in his way. A Calf officious, fain would show How he might twist himself and go. “Hold thou thy prate; all this (says he) “Ere thou wert calv'd was known to me.” He, that a wiser man by half Would teach, may think himself this Calf. FABLE X. The old Dog and the Huntsman. To Philetus. A Dog, that time and often tried, His master always satisfied; And whensoever he assail'd, Against the forest-beasts prevail'd Both by activity and strength, Thro' years began to flag at length. One day, when hounded at a boar, His ear he seiz'd, as heretofore; But with his teeth, decay'd and old, Could not succeed to keep his hold. At which the Huntsman, much concern'd, The vet'ran huff'd, who thus return'd. “My resolution and my aim, “Tho' not my strength, are still the same; “For what I am if I am chid, “Praise what I was, and what I did.” Philetes, you the drift perceive Of this, with which I take my leave. The End of the Fifth Book. THE APPENDIX OF GUDIUS. FABLE I. The Sick Kite. For many months a sickly Kite Was in a most disast'rous plight, And finding little hope, essay'd The bird her mother to persuade— “Yourself to all the fanes betake, “And vows for my recov'ry make.” This would I do, my son, says she, But fear 'twill to no purpose be. Since you with filth the altars stain'd, And ev'ry temple have prophan'd, Sparing no sacrifice at all, Say, on what God you'd have me call? FABLE II. The Hares weary of Life. They, who have not sufficient share Of patience their own ills to bear, Should those of other men inspect, And thence deduce the wish'd effect. Alarm'd by a prodigious cry, The Hares one day resolv'd to die, Rather than lead this life of dread; They therefore all together sped To seek a mountain, from whose height They might themselves precipitate. But as they went, the race of frogs Were startled in their weedy bogs, And miserably fled for fear— “Alas! why there are others here “(A Hare observ'd) whom woes molest— “Then bear your burden like the rest.” FABLE III. Jupiter and the Fox. A Nature, which in grain is mean, Nor wealth can hide, nor pow'r can skreen. When Jove had chang'd, by sov'reign might, A Fox into a lady bright, Enthron'd at court she shew'd her head, As partner of the royal bed; But seeing with a wishful look A beetle creeping from a nook, She from her lover sprung away, And jump'd upon the usual prey. The Gods laught hearty at the dame, The mighty father blush'd for shame, And as he turn'd the minx adrift, “Go where you will (says he) and shift, “Whose sneaking nature is so base “Our gifts and honours to disgrace.” FABLE IV. The Lion and the Mouse. This fable is a moral song, To bid us not inferiors wrong. As fast asleep a Lion lay, The sylvan Mice began to play, Till one, by rash misconduct, leap't Upon his body as he slept. The Lion, rousing from his nap, Seiz'd instant on the little chap— But he begs pardon for th'offence, The fault of mere improvidence. The king of beasts, who wisely knew No glory could to him accrue By taking vengeance for the deed, At once the Mouse forgave and freed. The Lion, in a little space, As late at night he urg'd the chace, Fell down into a pit, and there Found himself tangled with a snare. Then making all the roar he could, The list'ning Mouse came from the wood, And drawing near “Be not afraid, “For I'll requite your love,” he said. Then he his nibbling skill applies, And all the knots and joints he tries, At last he loosens every thread, With which his net the artist spread, And leaving nothing unexplor'd, The Lion to the woods restor'd. FABLE V. The Man and the Trees It is evident that Phædrus himself had an intention of rendering this Fable, particularly by a line in his first Prologue, ? Quod arbores loquantur, &amp;c.. They to despair themselves ally, Who with their aid the foe supply. A Man, with hatchet ready-made, Besought the Trees to lend their aid, And from the grove an handle spare— The Trees, attending to his pray'r, Ev'n all agree with one consent, That a wild olive should be lent: He takes the gift and makes his stroke, Beginning with a stately oak, And while he chose his Trees—an ash Bespoke an holm—“We have been rash, “And justly fall, since we ourselves “Have giv'n the cruel axes helves.” FINIS</field>
