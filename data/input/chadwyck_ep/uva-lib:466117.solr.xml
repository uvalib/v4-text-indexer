      <field name="fulltext">âNeque, te ut miretur turba, labores, contentus paucis lectoribus.ââHorace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dedicated IN LOVE AND UPLOOKING TO MY FRIEND JOHN ALEX. ELDER. SINCE THE ABOVE WAS WRITTEN HE TO WHOM IT WAS ADDRESSED DIED SUDDENLY IN HIS THIRTIETH YEAR. BUT I LET IT STAND AS IT IS. A TRUER FRIEND AND NOBLER SPIRIT NO MAN COULD KNOW.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To E. A. S. As into some waste space in a dark sky A new star swims serene, and calm, and bright, A never-fading steadfast lamp set high To fill with its immaculate far light The lonely darkness of the lonely nightâ So swam upon my dark the star of love. Before, afar off only had I seen Like planets in a distant heaven move: But when this rebirth of my soul had been, It was as tho' Life drew aside her screen; The music of the great seas deeper grew, A larger message fill'd each echoing shore, The swaying forests had a meaning new, And the sweet songs of birds so loved of yore Were sweeter still, and with a lovelier lore. Life, that once lay like some mere narrow sea Between fair promontories and shining sands, Thence stretched an ocean vast and great and free: Love was the arc that rose in shining bands And join'd the near with far imagin'd lands. Thou hast been as the light unto mine eyes, As music in the strange revolving days: Around us is the glory that ne'er diesâ The glory of the sun's awakening blaze, The splendour of the moon in cloud-girt waysâ These die not, but they ever bloom and fade; The beauty of thy soul is still the same: A glory for the Åons they were made; For all eternity thy spirit came Straight from thy God in an enduring flame. O best belov'd,âtoo dear for faltering words To tell thee trulyâwould that I could sing With the unconscious rapture of the birds That, mated, ev'ry morn till noontide fling Their overflowing music thro' the Spring: Or that with deep and solemn measured speech Such as the ocean in a windless night Moans incommunicably to the beach That dumbly listens thro' the moon-glare white, My words could track thy soul's still tender height. Thou art my moon, and I thy tide to roll Thro' storm and tempest as thro' winds that sleep! Thy love my pilot is,âI fear no shoal Or perilous straits that hidden dangers keep, Since thou art with me on this troubled Deep. THE HUMAN INHERITANCE. âI will make the poems of materials, for I think they are to be the most spiritual poems; And I will make the poems of the body and of mortality, For I think I shall then supply myself with the poems of the soul, and of immortality.â Walt. Whitman, Chants Democratic, âStarting from Paumanok.â Visions of life these are wherein are seen Types of the human, rounded differently By age and clime and diverse circumstance. Childhood, when the child is as a flower Of wilding growth, and when it is at one With nature, fellow with the winds and birds. Youth, when adventure is the salt of life, And all the passions hot, and when the years Seem weary if not shifting with swift change. Manhood and Womanhood, together twined In spirit, and with equal upward gaze: Moving with love through toil-ennobled years, And ever reaching unto higher things. And Old Age,âwork and toil being past: and soft The memories of sorrows: with the hope That, after one dark hour, youth comes again! Types of inheritors of that high life Which is of all the possible heritage; Types none the less tho' few there are who reach The half-guessed affluence of their periods. CYCLE I. CHILDHOOD'S INHERITANCE. I. Beneath the blue vault of a summer sky, Where little clouds with white wings strove to fly Far from the burning noon, leagues long there lay Wide heather moors that stretched till far away Northward faint hills arose and southward rolled The ocean gleaming with sun-litten gold. II. And 'mid a great swell of the purple waste Close to the sea, a rock, which no hand placed Thus lonely and afar but which was hurled A meteor from some ruin'd starry world, Rose dark and frowning, with its hoar sides scarred By winter tempests and the fiercely hard Gripe of the death-frosts that from northland heights Steal silent through grim January nights, And traced with furrows by the many tears Of rainy autumns thro' unnumber'd years. III. The purple moorland waste alone stretched wide Beneath the sunâno thing was seen beside To break the long still sweep that met the sky, No mounds of rocks confusedly piled high, No single tree with clear boughs limned in black Against the blue, no white and dusty track, But only miles and miles and miles that swept Purple to where the leagueless waters leapt. The old rock stood forth like an ancient throne Great tho' forgotten, where the winds alone Paid homage, fair in the sunshine of the day, Solemn by night with phosphorescent grey. IV. Around, the honey-laden bees humm'd loud With summer gladness; in a mazy cloud Whirling the grey gnats rose and wheeled and spun Swift golden motes within the golden sun; And bright with all their royal emblazonries Flashed like swift darts of fire great dragonflies. Away across the glowing moors there rang The lapwing's wild complaint, and far off sang Hidden in blue a small rejoicing lark Singing against some unseen yearn'd for mark: About the heath the yellowhammer's cry Piped sweet and clear, and often suddenly, With joyous chirps and jerks, the stonechat flew From spray to spray, and, darting flame-like through The scented heather spires to where beneath The ants had silent kingdoms in the heath, The green-grey black-eyed lizard flashing shot So swift the hawk on poised wings saw it not. V. O'er all the deep skies arch'd, a wondrous space Of ardent azure while the sun had place, That changed to dark deep depths when twilight grey Dreamt into night, dark'ning to one vast shade Of purple black, when lamplike star by star Sparkled or shone or pulsing flamed afar. Silence save for each blent and natural sound Of earth and airâwhere sea-caves made the ground, By tidal waves of ages undermined, Groan as in travailâwhen the trumpet wind All uncheck'd blewâor swelled the incessant cries Of tossed waves in their breaking agonies. VI. Upon the summit of the ancient stone (Whose birth was in Time's youth), and all alone, Sat silent, tranced, and motionless a child Like some sweet flow'r chance nurtured in the wild, Sat watching seabirds, with his eager eyes Full of the deep blue of the vaulted skies. A child, for he indeed was little more; A child at heart, such as whom make the door Of heaven seem open'd hereâto whom the seas Breaking in foam, and scattered spray-swept trees With long arms wrestling, and the winds on wings Invisible were wondrous living things. VII. A flower, for his wind-kissed locks unshorn Shone yellow as gold daffodils at morn; His eyes were blue as in the golden grain Windflow'rs are blue, and soft as after rain Violets that under dripping leaves have lain, And tender as a dappled fawn's that yearn For pity when the shrew-mice from the fern Shake down the dew-drops; 'neath his sunlit hair, As early morning, his sweet face was fair Beneath the sun-brown,âas a white bud rose That flushes faintly while the June sun glows. And even as he gazed there deeper grew Within his eyes a holier softer blue, Where some thought brooded in their sacred shade; It seemed almost as if some song were laid Asleep upon his face that yet would find Some perfect utterance for the echoing wind To carry to the birds; in reverie Raptured he saw what these could never see. VIII. Oh blessÃ©d time, when all God's world is fair And to the soul not foreign! When the bare Wide cruel wastes of death-encumber'd sea Seem as the voice of God that thunderingly Beats round the recreant earty; when morning seems The revelation of one's utmost dreams Of beauty; when the slow death of the day Makes all the west one glorious crimson way For happy souls that die; and when the moon, Wheeling her radiant orb thro' the dark noon Of night, with conscious splendour makes the seas Unutterably solemn, and great trees Lost in the shadow stand forth with huge limbs Ghastly and clear; when bird songs are all hymns Of joy and praise, and every wilding flower Is known and loved; and when each pent up hour Seems worse than wasted to the eager heart, That fain would hear the thrush-wings strike apart The beech leaves in short flight ere full and clear Burst the sweet tide of song, or watch the deer Stand with great eyes amid the fern, or high Hearken the cuckoo's music fill the sky. IX. He seemed content just silently to sit And watch the breaking waves, the swallows flit Like arrows through the air, save when along The summer wind swept bearing the sweet song Of happy larks, or the repeated cries Of plovers when they caught the hawk's keen eyes Fixt on their youngâand then he seem'd to be All sight and ear, as yearning tearfully To beat with spirit pinions that fine air Where at the gates of heaven exceeding fair The bird-songs rose and fell like silver tides, Or else to be as that royal bird that prides Itself on flinching not before the sun But stares undaunted, so he might have spun Downward with death upon the fierce pois'd hawk, Saving the moorland brood: not man or boy Seem'd he so much as some incarnate joy At one with all things fair, flow'r o' the sod And insect to the Loveliness call'd God. X. As a red rose that in full bloom doth spread Her soft flushed bosom to the wind ere dead 'Mid fallen leaves her queenliness is gone, So the fair westering day in glory shone Heedless of coming night though night was nigh. The sunset burned afar; the holy sky Seem'd filled with heavenly forms mail'd in clear gold Guiding their purple rafts through seas that rolled Immeasurably far off in crimson fire. The sea lay tranced watching the day expire, And tired waves rose and fell as though each pray'r Of rest long sought were granted. Everywhere God's blessing brooded. And at last the day, With one long earthward smile, dissolved away Veiling her head in twilight robes wherethrough The palpitating stars shone faint and few. XI. From out the darkening vault where they had hid Through sweltering heats of noon, swiftly there slid Star after star, each swimming from the near Dark blue of heaven as from a windless mere Rise in calm morning twilights white and clear Young lily buds that open golden eyes Which joy makes wider when the day doth rise. XII. Far inland, with an oft-repeated cry The curlew wailed, and swelled mysteriously Hoarse sounds from the dim sea. The boy's face grew White in the dusky shade as swiftly flew A great grey gull close by him, like a ghost Haunting the desolate margins of the coast: Great moths came out, with myriad sharded wings Huge beetles droned, and other twilight things Hummed their dim lives away, and through the air The flittermice wheeled whistling: while the glare Of summer lightnings flashing furtively Blazed for a moment o'er the sleeping sea. XIII. At last, with a long sigh, he turn'd and slid From the old rock, and for a little hid His face amongst the heather-spires that shook With cool sweet dews: then one last lingering look Across the twilight seas, whereo'er the moon Within her crescent shallop would sail soon, When with swift steps he turn'd and westward fled Across the moor by a little path that led, Almost unseen save known, till suddenly, Screened from the vision of the neighbouring sea, Low in a dip between two moorland mounds A cottage lay; whereto with rapid bounds He sped, and, bearing with him odours of salt foam, Entered the little doorway of his home. XIV. Almost alone they lived, father and son: The elder had come here, life's joy being done For him for ever, so that at the least He might have rest. Nature was his priest To soothe, and make Hope seem some possible thing And not the gleam of some phantasmal wing. Deep in his books he lived; with studious eyes Scarce noting the young life beside him rise From childhood into boyhood. Under skies Far south his wife was born, and there she bore The fruit that slew her; there for evermore The man's heart yearnÃ©d with a deathless need, And thus the child grew up like some wild weed Fair but untrain'd; a being that loved the birds And knew their speech, and heard mysterious words Whispered amid the silence of dim caves By surging tides; who loved the winds and waves With passionate joy; and whose clear soul was filled All day with music, as a lyre is thrilled By every breath of air: night, morning, noon, The fires of sunset, th' ever changing moon, The stars, the seas, the moors, the wave-worn rocks, The ultimate depths of heav'n, the white flocks Of drifting clouds about the skirts of dayâ All these seem'd his in some divine strange way, And he at one with them, and his glad soul But one small chord in the harmonic whole. CYCLE II. YOUTH'S INHERITANCE. I. A vast deep dome wherein the shining fires Of space hung panting, as though keen desires Burn'd in them to spring forth from the blind force That held them as in leash; a comet's course Blazed in the east, and constellations flamed As through the night they strode; the famed Canopus, whom on Syrian wastes afar Men once had worshipp'd, and the fiery star Aldebaran, and, sword-girt, great Orion Whose light feared not the moon'sâall these outshone With splendour from dark heaven, and many more Which mariners know well when drifting o'er The far south seas: the Southern Cross agleam With fire shone high, and, as in some fierce dream A tigress pants, the pulsing star men know As Sirius, in ever changing glow, Blood-red, and purple, green, and blue, and white, Flamed on the swarthy bosom of the night. II. As though the Power that made the Nautilus A living glory on the perilous Wild seas to roam, had from the utmost deep Call'd a vast flawless pearl from out its deep And carved it crescentwise, exceeding fair,â So seem'd the crescent moon that thro' the air With motionless motion glided from the west, And sailing onward ever seem'd at rest. III. Below, the wide waste of the ocean lay. League upon league of moonled waters, spray And foam and salt sea-send; a world of sea By strong winds buffeted. And furtively At times a shadow loomed above the waves Only to fade, as men say out of graves Troop spirits who flee back at mortal gaze; This shadow was a ship, which many days Ago had pass'd the doleful straits where sleep The storms that rage and ravin on the deep. She seem'd a bird, black, with tremendous wings Poised high above her, a condor-bird that brings Death in her sweep. Slowly the shadow grew Distinct, and the stars seem'd more faint or few, And the waves waxed wan and leaden, and afar I' the east the night seem'd troubled: ev'ry spar Stood forth in outline, and above the topmost sail The delicate glory of the moon grew pale. IV. The night rose from the east, and with slow sweep, Her shadowy robes about her, o'er the deep Far westward floated; the dusk, her sister fair, With soft remembering eyes and twilight hair, From out the brooding depths of heaven stole, And linger'd with her faint sweet aureole Of trembling light, as though she could not leave The shadowy ways she haunted, where waves heave As sighing in sleep, and as adream the wind Breathes hushfully. But lo, the east behind Quivers, and afar the horizon thrills One moment, and a seabird wails and shrills Then sinks to rest again. And like a dream That fades as we awake, or like the gleam Upon a child's face ere it falls to sleep, The tender twilight faded o'er the deep. V. Again the whole east trembled, and a hush Fill'd sky and sea; and then a rosy flush Stole upward, as sweet and delicately fair As pink wild roses in the April air. And suddenly some shafts of gold were hurled Right up into the sky, and o'er the world A molten flood seem'd imminent, till swift The rose veil parted in a mighty rift, And the great sun sprang forth, and o'er the sea Rose up resplendent, shining gloriously. VI. White shone the wind-fill'd sails of the tall ship Escaping from the waves, fain to outstrip This giant of the deep: a league behind The white track she had made danced in the wind Foaming and surging, while white clouds of spray Swept from the bows that cleft their wind-urged way. VII. And suddenly a shout came from the crew, For one had spied emerging from the blue What seem'd a delicate pale purple band Of morning cloud; no larger than a hand It lay asleep upon th' horizon line And like some lovely amethyst did shine. But this was land, and eager eyes were bent To take the wonder in. Even then a scent Of something sweeter than the salt sea-breeze Seem'd in the air, odours of spicy trees And sweet green grass, and fruits, and flow'rs the eye Sees only 'neath the hot Pacific sky; And every heart was glad, for each felt free For one day from the ever present sea. VIII. But after noon had passed with scorching rays The wind grew slack and ceased, and then a haze Crept from the quivering north, and to and fro Wandered the windless waves, as white sheep go Straggling about the meadow-lands when far The shepherd strays; and from the distant bar, White in both calm and tempest, that enwound What now was seen an island, came the sound Of breaking billows in a muffled roar, As in a shell one hears a wave-washed shore. And soon the sea itself grew still and mild And seem'd to sleep, just as a little child After its boisterous play and fretful rest Lays down its head upon its mother's breast, And, smiling, becomes one of God's pure things Once more: and as with folded wings An angel sleeps upon the buoyant air So wholly slept the wind; while, with her hair A misty veil about her, Silence rose And cast o'er sea and sky her hush'd repose. IX. As a dream slowly onward drifts to sleep So stealthily the windless ship did creep Closer and closer to the foaming bar; Noon burned above, like furnace vast afar Flaming unseen; and, with a dazzling glare, The sleeping ocean heaved her bosom bare As some great woman of the giant days Supine 'mid mountain-grasses in the rays Of an intolerable sun might breathe With panting breasts: far in cool depths beneath 'Mid swaying loveliness of ocean weed Bright fish swam to and fro, and with fell speed The pale shark gleamed and vanish'd, as when Death Is seen a moment 'mid life's failing breath. X. At last a boat put off from the ship's side Urged by swift oars,âa speck upon the wide And dazzling waste: and soon the bar was crossed, And the long ridge, where foam for ever tossed Like fountain sprays around, once past, a mile Of motionless loveliness without the smile Of even one young rippling wave stretched on Till its blue lips the white sands fawned upon. XI. Swift in the rowlocks swept the oars, and fast The boat fled strained and throbbing until past The azure mile, and on the shelving beach Its brown keel grided sharply; each to each Shouted with joyous cries and boyish mirth To feel beneath their feet the steadfast earth Again, to see the scared birds scream and fly Circling around, the waving palms on high Heavy with milk-filled nuts, and branches bent With juicy fruits, and a little stream that sent Delicious thrills of thirst thro' each one there So clear it seem'd and like some living thing Dancing and splashing in its wandering: And then to feel the very air fill'd full Of scents delicious stealing from the cool Green forest shades, heavy magnolias fair O'er brimm'd with odours sweet, green maiden-hair Quivering above the intoxicating bliss Of heavy laden lilies, each a kiss Lost to the world of lovers, but grown here To shape and hue, of festooned orchids made Of colours such as burn in rainbows, fade Gloriously in sundown western skies, Or shine within the splendour of sunrise: Great fragrant blossoms twined amongst the trees Like prisoned birds-of-paradise, by bees And gorgeous insects haunted: and such deeps Of billowy green (the loveliness that sweeps The soul more swift to joy than brightest flow'rs), As though the forest were a myriad bow'rs, Too fair for man, wrought hither into one For the fair dreams of old who 'neath the sun Laugh'd in the vales of Tempe, or outrun The stag in Attic woods, or danced upon Hymettus and the slopes of Helicon. XII. But one amongst the joyous men withdrew And wander'd inland, for his spirit knew That rapt delight in its own subtle mood When the soul craves and yearns for solitude Akin to its own loneliness of joy. A man in strength and stature, yet a boy In years and heart, to whom the whole sweet, fair, And beautiful world was a thing laid bare By God for man to love, to whom it seemed A loveliness more sweet than he had dreamed Of woman in the passionate dreams of youth: He saw the joy and glory, not the ruth And death and grief that unto older eyes Dwell likewise there, as water underlies The still white beauty of the frost: but to The poet it must seem so ever, new And fresh and wonderful and sweet and true And ever-changing, for although he know The strange coincidence of natural woe With what to him is as the breath of God, He sees beyond and deeperâevery clod Of earth that holds a flow'r-root is to him The casement of a miracle; in the grim Reflux, decay, that doth pervade all things, He sees not but the shadow of death's wings, But only mists of sleep and change that drift Till the bowed face of Life again shall lift. XIII. As the hot day swooned into afternoon Hotter and hotter grew the air, and soon All the north-western space of sky became Heavy, metallic, where the heat did flame In quivering bronze; and the sea grew changed Tho' moveless still, as though dark rivers ranged Purple and green and black throughout its deeps; At times, as a shudder comes o'er one who sleeps And dreams of something evil, swiftly flew Across its face a chill that changed the blue To a sheet of beaten silver; then again It slept on as before but as in pain. XIV. And suddenly the ship's gun fired, and then Three times the ensign dipped; startled, the men A moment stared, then down the shingly strand Sped swiftly, and from the silvery sand That edged the wave-line launched their boat and sprang Each to his place, and soon there sharply rang Through the electric air the cleaving oars That swept them seaward from the island shores. XV. The sea seemed changed to oil, heavy and dark And smooth, with frequently a blotch-like mark Or stain, as though the lifeless waves had died Of some disease and lain and putrified. And like a drop of oil, heavy and thick, A raindrop fell making a sheeny flick That glitter'd strangely; then another came, Another, and another, till a flame Of pale wan light flicker'd above the waves That slept, or lifeless lay, as over graves New-made a ghastly glimmer drifts and gleams, Or as that vagrant fire that faintly streams O'er lonely marsh lands thro' each swarthy night. There was a strange, weird, calm, unearthly light Shifting about the sky, as o'er the face Of one who had been fair a smile might chase The horror of some madness half away. The raindrops ceas'd: from the boat's oars the spray Fell heavily: and then once more it rained Slow drops awhile the boat's crew gained The ship, where all with waiting anxious eyes Watched the metallic gloom of brazen skies. XVI. And suddenly there crashed a dreadful peal Right overheadâthe whole world seem'd to reel And stagger with the blow: the heaven's womb Opened and brought forth flame: an awful gloom Stretched like a pall and shrouded up the sun: Then once again the thunder seem'd to stun The shaking firmament, and livid jags Of lightning tore the cloud-pall into rags, Again and yet again as tho' 'twere hurled Straight down for the destruction of the world, And yet again like hell's fire uncontrolled: And ceaselessly the deafening thunder rolled Above and all around, as though the ship Was in the hollow of God's hand, whose grip Would close ere long and into powder grind. At last burst forth the fury of the wind Imprison'd long, which like a wild beast sprang Upon the panting sea and howling swang Its great frame to and fro, and yelled and tore Its heaving breast, tossing thick foam like gore In savage glee about; and like a spray Of blossom whirled before a gale, away The ship was swept o'er boiling seas that fled Before the wild wind howling as it sped Far from its thunderous caverns overhead. XVII. And not till then it suddenly was known That on the island whence their barque had flown One who had thither gone was left behindâ He who had wandered inland: but the wind Blew ever with a shrill and doleful cry, Calling the bloodhound waves to faster fly And seize the fleeing ship; a million deaths Leagues behind follow'd them with clamorous breaths; To turn were to perish, and so they sped Onward, as helpless as a whirling grain Of sand upon a tempest-stricken plain. XVIII. Meanwhile the island trembled 'neath the pow'r Of the rushing wind, as though its final hour Had come upon it; but he whose eager eyes Watched the frail ship being hurl'd far out of sight Feared not so much himself the tempest's might But rather for those friends swept far away. If saved, he knew that some immediate day Would see the white sails gleaming on the sea Beyond the bar again, and joyously He laughed to think of happy hours to spend Yet here awhile. Two hours passed, and the end O' the storm came; and while he watched it sweep Like a destroying angel o'er the deep Far to the south, the sun shone forth again, The birds shook from their wings the clinging rain And thrilled the air with gladness, and the land Bloomed out afresh, and on the shining sand The waves broke with a soft repentant motion; Miles and miles stretched the foaming dancing ocean, Tossing blue waves in glee and whirling spray Hither and thither, until tired of play And wearying for calm dreams it also grew Quiet and still and slept in one dense blue. XIX. It was now late in the sweet afternoon, The hours of shadow and sweet rest: and soon The day would fall asleep in sunset clouds And twilight steal and cover earth with shrouds Of morning dusk, until the solemn night Would eastward come crown'd with the lambent light Of the full golden moon. But still the sun Hung high in the west, nor would his course be run For one hour yet or more, and land and sea Owned him yet lord in regnant majesty. XX. On the north-west of the island rose a height, Crown'd with tall waving palms, of coral white Heaved through long years from sea-depths far below. Thither the young man turn'd his steps to go To see the farewell splendours of the day All marshall'd in magnificent array. XXI. He passed whole brakes of sweet magnolias, fair Orchids with flushed white breasts and streaming hair, Lilies with languorous golden eyes, and flowers That stooped to kiss him from their leafy bowers Hid in green spaces; then right through a glade Of trembling tree-ferns wander'd; then the shade Of lofty palms enclosed him, till he came Once more on orchids, each one as a flame, Scarlet, or white, or purple, tree-ferns high Warming their trailing tresses 'neath the sky Where the sun burn'd low down, frond laid on frond Of spiked green cacti, and at last, beyond A stretch of dazzling sand, laughing in glee The blue bright jubilant waters of the sea. XXII. And suddenly he started as though stung By some hid snake, then down his frame he flung And looked with eager eyes. Upon the strand He saw brown figures moveâa joyous band Of laughing girls: and lo, upon the crown Of a great billow that came thundering down, One fair girl-shape with long hair blown behind Poised for a moment! The soft western wind Thrill'd with sweet echoed cries, and then once more A great curved billow swooped upon the shore Bearing an agile form that gleam'd forth bright Like shining bronze against the sunset light. For a very vivid and beautiful description of the skill of the Pacific Islanders in this native pastime see the fascinating volume by Mr. C. W. Stoddard, entitled Summer Cruising in the South Seas. (1874.) XXIII. Quite close upon the shore he lay; so near, He saw the happy light within their clear Dark eyes, and saw their joyous laughter make A sweetness round their lips, and saw them shake The thick black tresses of their hair, all wet With salt sea-spray. He thought that he had met The fabled syrens, or the nymphs of eld Whom Pan loved dearly, by hard fate compell'd To leave their antique Greeceâand as he stood Wrapt in the pleasant vision of this mood, A cry shrill'd suddenly along the sand, And in a moment almost the bare strand Stretched white and lonely, for as shadows flee When the sun springs impetuously From mountain peak to peak so swiftly fled The nude bronze figures. The sinking sun, red Like a wounded warrior king, lay down I' the west to die, taking his shining crown Of gold from off his brow, which unseen hands Held poised above him in mid air: the lands That he had conquer'd thro' the long fierce day, And seas that owned his rule, faded away Before his filming eyes, but, ere the night Should come, once more he rais'd his stricken sight From out the purple royal robes that wound About his limbsâstared straight, as on a hound Baying a lion far off, on Night whose size Gigantic loomed i' the eastâstrove yet to rise But could notâso lay back with glazing eyes Upon the blood-stain'd cloudsâwhile overhead A star leaped forth knowing his lord was dead. XXIV. But he had heard that in these happy isles Friendly the natives wereâthat welcome smiles Met each who wander'd thereâso forth he went Across the shingly strand, then stopped and sent A shrill cry through the air. And speedily Tall lissom figures drew anear; then he By signs related how the changeful sea Had brought him thither, and how hunger made Him weary: and thereafter, when he stayed His signs and waited, one who seem'd a chief Stepped forth and handed him a palm-tree leaf In sign of friendship, and with kindly eyes Lifted his hand and waved it all around As though to say that all things he had found Were his, that here he might find welcome rest And live with them partaking of their best. XXV. They led him then across the sands to where, In a delicious hollow where cool air That late had wander'd on the thirsty seas Dwelt in green spaces, 'neath great branchÃ©d trees Cluster'd their huts: and entering into one The old chief led him as an honour'd son, And soon sweet fruits and flesh of fowl and kid Were laid before him, plantain-bread amid Its broad green leaves, and the strong native wine The palm-nuts give, and sweet fish from the brine New caught, and water from a running stream That gurgled near like music in a dream. XXVI. The short and tender twilight had now fled, And all night's starry hosts shone overhead In myriad fires, and rising suddenly The orb'd and yellow moon above the sea Shone full: it might have been the risen soul From a dead sea whose waves had ceased to roll. XXVII. And at the sound of laughter on the sands Those in the hut came forth: clapping his hands The old chief made some summons, and anear One drewâa living loveliness, with clear Dark wonderful large eyes whose depths contained The passionate spirit in the flesh enchained: A mouth like some wild rose bud red, a bare Bronzed beautiful neck, round which her waving hair Swayed like the wind-blown tendrils of a vine, Or like the tangled sea-weed in the brine Tide drifted to and fro; her bosom swelled Urged by her panting heart, as when beheld Of old the queen, whose face made all the world One war, the eyes of Anthonyâor as When Helen flush'd when Paris first did pass Before her with fixt gaze; around her waist A girdle of fair feathers interlaced With cowrie shells drooped slant-wise to her knee, And small and delicate feet, like those that flee Among the shadowy hills at dawn when far The twilight hours speed 'fore the morning star, Press'd but scarce marked the sand: she stood as one Tranced in a vision, and he as on that sun Columbus stared that offered him the West. Love's fire was litten sudden in each breast. XXVIII. Ah! in the years to come how that night seemed Some beautiful vision that he long since dreamed! The moon rose slowly o'er the sea, as though She linger'd in those heavenly ways wherethro' The stars shone as bright flow'rs: the leagueless deep Had lullabied its waters into sleep, And only at long intervals there blew A cool soft fanning wind that ere long grew Aweary also, and so stirred aside The slow reluctant leaves and like a tide Crept ever farther in amongst the trees Till in a little dell, with flow'rs the bees Haunted all day, it sank to restful ease. Laughter and wild strange music from curv'd shell And palm-tree flute far echoed; the sea swell Urged hushfully its endless monotoneâ And he the ship had left stood there alone And knew it not, for his whole life was filled With the utter peace, and his spirit thrilled With imminent joy, and all his heart was hot With new-born love, and all else was forgot. XXIX. When he that night lay sleeping on his bed Woven of palm-tree fibre, strange dreams fled Like ghosts through the dark valley of his sleep. He dreamt he saw the green weeds of the deep Swaying unconscious of the light of day, And 'neath their convolutions lo! there lay Two shining gems that seem'd alive with light: And then he dreamt that dark eternal night Brooded for ever, without change, aroundâ Till suddenly two stars leaped with a bound From out the womb of chaos, staring straight Upon him: and next he dreamed that fate Had wash'd his wan drown'd body to the strand Where the waves wanton'd with him, when a hand He saw not pulled him from the brine that made His tangled hair like sea-weed, softly laid His wave-tossed head upon a bank of flow'rs, and drew A palm branch 'twixt him and the burning blue Of heaven; and then he oped his weary eyes And met the gaze of one from Paradise: And then he woke, and knew the gems he saw Down in the ocean depths with such strange awe, And the two stars that made th' eternal night Pregnant with message, and the orbs that o'er Him bent when death had washed him to the shore, Were each time but the eyes of her whose gaze Had flashed to his soul's utmost depths, whose face Seem'd burned and printed on his heart, whose grace Haunted his inward vision as when floats The fair mirage 'fore him who far off notes Its unsubstantial beauty, shining clear Yet never to be reached or be brought near. XXX. Six days passed, and it seem'd as though he had Dwelt there since birth: joyous, unthinking, glad, He was at one with those who lived around. They called him by some sweet name like a sound Of distant music, and the name that meant So much to him and all the quick blood sent Up to her face whene'er to her he spake Was AluhÃ . Oft by a little lake That inland lay half hidden by great white And scented lilies, curtain'd from the light By tall and shadowy fronds of fern, they strolled Hand claspt in hand; and when the fragrant gold That was the heart of some great forest-flow'r Fell on their face and hands in a sudden show'r, Stirred by some quivering wing of bird the heat Kept silent 'midst the leaves, her laughter sweet Rippled like falling water, till their eyes Of a sudden met, and a swift flush did rise And make her face a ruddy damask rose, And his hand trembled as of one who knows A perilous abyss beside him yawn. And in the tender beauty of the dawn Together they went down and watched the sea With little wavelets splashing hushfully Beyond the breaking rollers, till afar The east was seen to tremble, and a star Made of pure gold to twinkle on a wave, Till suddenly the sun, as from a grave A soul might spring rejoicing, sprang sheer up Above the sky-lineâand as from a cup O'er-brimm'd the flooded water pours, clear gold Along the lifted waves resistless rolled. XXXI. And on the seventh day the tropic sun Grew fiercer still; the noon-heats seemed to stun Both sea and land, and the long afternoon Lay like a furnace on the deep: the moon Sailed through the breathless sky at last and brought Cool shadows; till a little breeze long sought Wander'd on vagrant wings unto the isle. Where the strand crescent curv'd, almost a mile From the palm-shaded huts, there was a bend Of forest, sweet with heavy scents, the end Of a magnolia brake; and overhead Tall tree-ferns waved, and thick grass made a bed Where the dark sky and stars were seen alone, And the sea was not save for its hush'd moan. XXXII. And there the lovers lay silent and still. At times the listless wind would send a thrill Through the dark leaves, or a hidden bird would shake Its wings while dreaming, or a wave would break On the unseen sea with an unusual sound, Or suddenly a beetle on the ground Would clang its sharded wings, yet these but made The silence deeper. Lost within the shade The lovers lay: her dark eyes watched a star Straining in heaven as though its fires impelled It forth to spring where it far down beheld The earth in soft light spin; he watched her eyes Reflect the panting star-fire in the skies; And then he trembled, and once strove to speak But could not. Then against his flushing cheek A tress of hair wind-lifted from her breast Brushed gently: then he sudden stooped and pressed His lips to hers, and clasped her close and cried In a strange voice AluhÃ ! Side by side Silent they lay awhile, as though half dazed By extreme passion: till at last she raised Her eyes to his with one long look that thrilled His spirit with love's ecstasy fulfilled. XXXIII. And like a dream the long night drifted past, As a thick mist, stirred by no mountain blast But moving in some strange mysterious way, Drifts o'er the steep hill sides. Faint, wan, and grey The far east grew, and in the dusky sky The moon sail'd lustreless, and mistily The planets shone, and paled each starry fire Each like some sad and unfulfill'd desire. XXXIV. And when the sun rose it was in a mist Wrought of pale gold, purple, and amethyst, Changing to lovely carmine, then to rose, Then to a faint blue haze of heat; like snows That melt away before the soft south wind Each wandering cloud faded the sun behind: And over all the quivering sky there spread A deepening haze, so that overhead The sun tho' flaming fiercely was not seen. Ere this the light stirred through their leafy screen And woke the lovers: in his eyes the fire Of passion was not quenched, and still desire Dwelt in the shadowy depths of those he loved: Still hand in hand they lay; and neither moved, As though they feared the breaking of some charm Too dear for speech. At last she stole her arm Around his neck and put her lips to his And wedded him again with one long kissâ And all the blood within him was like wine Burning his veins; his spirit felt divine In the first flush of love surpassing sweet, And in this climax life seem'd made complete. XXXV. Then hand in hand, with ever and again Eyes seeking eyes, as though with hungry pain Love starved for reassurance, ever new And wonderful,âthey went, shaking the dew That glistened on each leaflet to the ground. There was an ominous absence of all sound Such as most mornings knew; the quivering haze Curtain'd the well-lov'd sky, and to their gaze It seemed the palms and heavy flowers stooped Already heavy, and in the shadow drooped The birds with half closed wings, or swiftly sped Voiceless to deeper shade: but overhead A whirling insect flew with a fierce drone Shrill and metallic: with a stifled moan The brooding sea remembered some old grief. And when upon the ground a wither'd leaf Fell rustling, though not a breath of wind blew there, It whirled in circles thro' the electric air. XXXVI. AluhÃ  passed into her hut, and he Sought coolness in his own: noon heavily Drew near, and with a brooding sense of pain Fill'd up the day. All nature seem'd to strain Expectant of some evil, as men wait Helpless the heavy hand of imminent fate. XXXVII. And suddenly like some far distant gun A long low rumble mutter'd: the red sun Shrunk thro' a livid mist, and shone no more. A billowy swell swept swiftly on the shore Though no wind blew; the oily sea was freaked With lines such as a stagnant pool is streaked; And the tall palm-trees shiver'd, as a breath Of icy air had whispered them of death. XXXVIII. Again, like far artillery in the sky, The distant thunder rattled: a low sigh Moan'd o'er the deep, but not a drop of rain Fell from above,âthen all was still again. Dark and more dark it grew, as though the day Were shadow'd in eclipse; but far away Strange sudden lights were darting through the clouds, Like gleaming corpse lights o'er a dead sun's shrouds; And darker still it grew, till overhead Aterrible livid blackness was outspread And the storm brooded right above the isle. Still the same awful silence! Mile on mile Of wan and purply waters lay as tho' They sank from some fierce scourge, and to and fro A surface-current twisted like a black And sinuous serpent; the salt sea-wrack Oozed out a filthy scum that sullenly Blotched the dead calm with spots like leprosy. XXXIX. And suddenly, as 'twere the crash of doom, Heaven seem'd to rock! From out the blasted womb Of the thick darkness belched a stream of fire Blazing and burning, as though hell's desire Furrowed the world, that shook and quaked and reeled As deafeningly the dreadful thunder peeled From horrible abysses in the sky. And in the midst thereof a piercing cry Of human pain followed a livid flash Of lightning, when again a dreadful crash Blasted the air o'erhead while rock and steep Shook as by motion of the swaying deep. XL. Then, as though all the floods that heav'n had stored For days and days were loose, the dense rain poured Downward in blinding torrents: till an hour Dragged slowly past; and then it seem'd the power O' the storm had vanish'd. Far off in the east The thunder howled still, like a savage beast Famished and tearing at its stricken prey. But from the isle it was now far away, And the sun shone once more, and a cool breeze Blew from the south, and the drench'd dripping trees Flashed as though clad in shining coats of mail. And lo! upon the west sea-marge a sail Hover'd like some white bird,âbut heeding not The sea or what it held the lover sought His bride of one sweet night, and drawing near Called AluhÃ ! And then with sudden fear He saw her father's hut was torn half down And part all scarred and scorched; its crown Of palm leaves was no more, but on the ground Lay strewn and broken; and not a single sound Bless'd his strained ear. With shaking hands he drew The fallen leaves aside, and then he knew Whose dreadful cry it was that shook the air Above the din! With all her lovely hair Strewn o'er the delicate bosom's dusky grey, And with closed eyes, hence loveless, quiet she lay. Only adown the tender brow there ran A narrow furrow. Close by lay a man, Her brother, with a scorch'd and blacken'd cheek, And on his face the unenfranchised shriek Which swift death intercepted: without stain Or mark dead also the old chief! All pain Was over for them, and their little life Was ended as a dream or bygone strife. XLI. So still they lay: he could not quite believe Each spark of life had fled. Could cruel fate weave Such sorrow from her loom for no good end? But when he took the hand which used to send Such tremors through him, kissing it again And yet again, and felt the dreadful pain Of no response, and in a numbed strange daze Looked in the eyes where from his eager gaze Death shrouded up the soul, he knew at last All that had come to him: his sweet dream past, His passionate love a thing that was no more But only a stinging memory to brood o'er, Life turned a little wearier, and the morn Of youth grief-clouded, older grown, forlornâ When all this came upon him the sobs shook His strong young frame. And then once more he took His dear love in his arms, and kissed her lips As though her spirit yet from the eclipse Wherein it lay might wake, calling her wife And darling, his dear love, his joy, his life, Till the sobs choked his utterance and stayed The agony of his loss. And then he laid Her gently down, and one long farewell gazed Then left and wander'd forth as one half dazed. XLII. 'Twas late in the afternoon when down the strand He saw one running towards him with his hand Pointing out seaward o'er the curving bay. And lo! before his eyes his own ship lay With yards squared round, and urged by splashing oars The longboat steering for the island shores. XLIII. A few short hours ago he would have bid The old life glad good-bye, choosing amid The island folk to dwellâbut now the land Was hateful to him, for no loving hand Would beckon him again by the little lake That slumber'd lily-clad; no eyes would make His heart beat fast with joy; and never again Would the dear voice replace the last hour's pain. XLIV. So, when the boat's keel grided on the shore, And eager shipmates clasped his hand once more, A great weight was uplifted from his heart: Yet was he loth when the hour came to part With those who loved him and had made him seem One of themselves. But soon 'twas all a dream Strange and unreal, when, standing on the deck, He saw the island lessen to a speck In the fast gathering twilight. Soon his eyes No more beheld the earthly paradise Where he had tasted the sweet joy of love, Yet the same solemn moon that sailed above Had seen their passion bloom, a tropic flower, Through one delicious, lost, remember'd hour. XLV. For youth is but a glad forgetfulness, Or rather, passing onward: the years bless With such sweet copious gifts, the soul stays not To linger with sad sorrows best forgot But like the tender south wind of the spring It goes from flow'r to flow'r, while glad birds sing And the blue skies are fair: what good to wait By this or that blown rose until too late We find the sombre autumn drawing nigh Wherein few roses bloom? For steadily The years come round wherein past youth doth seem The irrevocable beauty of a dream. CYCLE III. MANHOOD AND WOMANHOOD'S INHERITANCE. I. âFive years have passed, and still the world has brought But little change to me. High things I sought For mind and hand to do: the world seem'd fair Before me, and I felt the strength to dare And conquer. Five short years since that day When, for the last time, I looked on the grey BelovÃ©d college walls, and knew at last That manhood had begun and youth was past.â II. So to himself spake Arnold Selwyn, as With slow enjoying steps he trod the grass Fresh with cool dews and gentle summer show'rs In the sweet dawn of a May day, whose hours Were sacred here as on the hills and leas Far from the city smokeâfor 'neath the trees Heavy with myriad lamp-like chestnut blooms Of Kensington he wander'd: from hot rooms He came, where all the summer evening through The dancers had not flagged. The blackbirds flew About his path, with mellow voices clear Full fluted, and, from an old beech-tree near, A song-thrush, poised upon a branch wind sway'd, Sang wild with its own music, till afraid With extreme bliss its tremulous trills piped low And with a far-off sadness, like the flow Of windless waters on an alien beachâ Till the soft lights among the green leaves, each A little waving wing, its heart away Swept in a tide of joy once more; the spray Shook with its wild delight, which thrill'd and thrill'd Till silenced in sheer ecstasy. It fill'd The heart of him who listen'd with a glad Rebirth of youthâsuch joy as Chaucer had (A singer like the birds) when wandering Through woods at dawn in some old English spring. III. And the rooks wheeled up black against the sky Cawing with busy clamour; shrill and high A distant lark rejoiced; the redbreasts sang Amidst the chestnut-snows and sparrows sprang From bough to bough low twittering; from tall And sunlit limes, in soft aerial fall The delicate scented blossoms waver'd down, And sweet the tender grass smelt. From the town A distant murmuring sound subdued and far Hummed thro' the leafy boughs, but did not mar The woodland sweetnessâas we often hear, Lying 'mid the mossy roots of some old peer Amongst his fellow oaks, with nought else round But waving ferns and nestled near the ground Shy primrose tufts, a low, faint, soothing sound Steal from some unseen hollow wherein moves O'er pebbly channels and thro' time-worn grooves With soft, slow, gurgling music a clear stream Twisting and turning like a silver gleam. IV. But with the gladness was a mingled pain That stayed the longer: and sad thoughts again Linger'd like guests unwelcome in his brain. Though fickle moods seemed with him, moods that ranged From sadness into brightness, for there changed Often upon his face for a little while The wearied look for a remembering smile Of something pleasantâwordless memories That brought a shining softness to his eyes. V. âFive years ago I thought the world lay wide Before my youth, and that the first spring-tide Would bear me on to fortune. As then, still The world isâbut the world is oped by will And not by hope. And when I lightly drew My anchor from the old tried faiths, I knew But little of the yawning depths that roll With dreadful power around the labouring soul That seeks but finds no haven. All seem'd straight And easy to o'ercome, and fortunate fate To be assured: too fortunate, alas! For each of these five useless periods was To me a snare, and with each month therein I dallied, thinking I might haste and win The work that makes true manhood noble when My spirit should say now! Thus was it then, And so it is even yet. Drifted about By this view or by that, each put to rout By every phase successiveâwith no aim Of definite purpose, yet desiring fame In whatsoever thing I undertook I might have guessed that failure would outlook My path all round. And yet I know that I Have gifts beyond the accomplishments that lie Within the grasp of most; art has to me Been ever a fair dream: it now shall be Something beyond the pleasure of an hour. Let me work out my manhood thus, with pow'r Such as I have, and give to it my heart And soul: for true laborious work's the part And portion of each man, and he who shirks Labour of hand and mind, and feebly lurks In weary and empty byways of his life Moves ever backward. For in steadfast strife And upward toil alone can there be found That which each soul to fuller life shall round.â VI. Hark, the wild thrush notes once again! He heard The full soul singing right o'erhead, and stirred No further step, but listen'd with rapt ears And thrilling sense: even as in old years Long past the young Marsyas might have stood And hearken'd such an one fill all the wood With matchless music, learning thence the song Of fluted notes he would regret ere long. VII. It ceased, song being at last expressionless, And onward Arnold went, with on his face The sunshine of some inner pleasantness. His thoughts had backward flown to where last night From out the throng of dancers on his sight One face had fixt itself, passing him by Unconscious,âas a dream mysteriously Bears sometimes from the haunted lands of sleep A wonderful vision with dark and deep Presageful eyes, and face that doth inherit All man's lost dreams of beauty, pale brows lit As by some inner radiance, and a mouth Wreath'd with such lips as hers who in the South Long since Troy razed and wasted for a kissâ Swims from the depths of sleep, but ere the bliss Groweth real fades silently away As into night melts twilight wan and grey, So that the soul but faint remembrance has When morning comes. Beneath him on the grass He saw the upturn'd face and the deep eyes Wherein love brooded half awake; the skies, Smiling on summer with a languid peace, Held it within their depths; and 'mid the trees Shadowed by waving boughs, he saw it move And vanishâa will-o'-the-wisp of love. VIII. And ever and again within his mind The hours of the past night relivedâthe wind Singing an undertone wherein the word âLilianâ rose and fell, as the sea is stirred By tidal heaves at ninth-wave intervals. He stood within the flashing mirror'd walls And watched the dancers pass, until that face Glanced close to his with its supreme sweet grace Of lovelinessâand then as one whose eyes Watch the long purple line of land arise Out of the seas after a weary time Of tossing to and fro in a bitter clime, So kept his gaze transfix'd where'er she went. At last the time came when his head he bent Before her, and heard spoken the sweet name That now the wind repeated. A soft shame Flushed the pale delicate face, as a white rose Were crimsoning beneath the kiss of June, Being conscious of his furtive eyes; and soon They left the crowded rooms, and in a cool Green-leaved recess, where, in a little pool Fern-fringed and rock-girt, with a gentle sway Of sound a sheeny fountain splashed alway, They sat unseen of any. Something strange Had come to him; he knew not what, some change That brought a thrilling sense of a delight Of imminent revealment, while the night Seemed some prolonged enchantment leading on To joys expectant afar off. Upon His ears the blent strains of the music fell With hushful sound, and o'er his soul a spell Seemed cast, sweet as on fields of asphodel Shadowed by palms of Paradise doth steep Each new-come spirit in a joy of sleep. IX. They err who say that love must be of slow And well-proved growthâas if the heart must glow Alone as the fanned flames of a slow fire. Love ofttimes springs, clothed with a wild desire, And takes the reins of life in hand ere quite The soul hath felt the change; and fills the eyes With ardent longing and a glad surprise And a strange light and rapture beyond speech. One looks upon another, and for each The past has suddenly grown old, a flame Is lit within each heart, and a soft shame Dwells in each look, and life yearns unto life And all the world with hopes and fears seems rife. X. Before they left that night both eyes had told A similar tale, and each stirred heart did hold The rumour of a sudden happiness. But few words passed; yet love doth oft express Himself in silence best. The casual touch Of lace, or falling flo w'r, or hand,âall such Were ministers of love that sent a thrill Through him, as o'er the brooding surface still Of a calm sea swift airs go wanderingâ And when his lips once said some little thing And laughed, whereby his breath breathed on her hair She flushed and trembled, and her bosom fair Heaved with a quicken'd motion, a swift beat That whisper'd something new and strange and sweet. XI. At last they had to part, but when she went He saw before him still each lineament Of the fair girlish face; and but one word 'Mid all the noise around his spirit heard, The one word âLilian.â And when far away Her carriage rolled through the awakening day And chastened sweetness of the dawn the air Seemed full of music, and the wind to bear On its soft pinions, as a bird might do, The burden of his name whose love she knew. XII. Hark! hark! O sweet and clear, again, again, The over rapturous thrush with a half pain And half extremity of joy makes all The air alive with song: with fluted call The blackbird sounds his summons to his mate, And the rooks cawing in the air await The signal for their uniform ascent To distant fields. And homeward Arnold went With a changed life and purpose of his own And the long follies of his youth outgrown. XIII. Three months passed, wherein life at last was found No idle dream, but ever steadfast round Of labourâand where love half-guessed had spun A weft of magic. Love indeed had won His soul from sloth, and given to him a hope That would not die again, but that would ope The future to his arms: and love had brought Each aspiration that he once forgot Back to his mind once more; and love each day Was with him and his soul did sway Hither and thither ever tending higher, And ever grew the strength of his desire For her he loved, as a long trammelled fire In mines beneath the soil doth grow and grow Until at last the flames flash to and fro Above the enfringing depths. She was to him A faith, a hope, a joy, the wine at the brim Of that which held life's last draught and supreme: She was the moon to lead his wavesâthe dream To inspireâthe guide to reach the roadâ The hand to slack the burden of life's load. XIV. Not yet had words escaped himâyet she knew He loved her; and her fair face daily grew Sweeter with knowing it; and her heart was fill'd With joy. And ofttimes bright dreams she would build Wherein the two with wedded love would reach To that which poets dream of when they teach Love is the key of life. And so went by The months, until the clear autumnal sky Saw the oak change to russet, and the planes Grow yellow, and the equinoctial rains Wash the white dust from off the beech-tree leaves, With heaped up here and there damp amber sheaves Of elm and chestnut, and the sunburnt mould Gleaming with fallen leaves of lime-tree gold. XV. Both had been absent from the dusty town Through the late summer. Where the cliffs shelve down Most steeply to the surging Cornish seas A little village lies, which the spray flees Right over when a wild wind's from the westâ And there they both by chance had found a rest From dusty London for a time; but soon She left again, and then, as is a tune With sudden discord filled, so seem'd the place To Arnold not the same when once her face Haunted the shores no more. Yet still he strove To reach the secret that he sought; and wove Upon the canvas a fair dream that would Inherit all the passion of his mood. So the days passed in work, the nights in dreams Of love, save when the August moon's full beams Tempted him forth to hear the night waves chime Their inarticulate prophecies sublime, And the sea lay his hoary head beneath The shadow of the cliffs and faintly breathe. So went the happy weeks until at last He knew that he must leave: one night he passed Wandering along the ever-sounding shores Rapt in sweet dreamsâthe next he heard the hoarse And constant turmoil of the streets. But here He was near that which made his life seem dear. XVI. Cloudless the sky was, calm and soft and blue: Cawing, the homeward rooks in circles flew Above the lofty elms, and everywhere The sparrows twitter'd thro' the warm still air; Eastward the chestnuts, cluster'd near the banks Of the Long Water in irregular ranks, Faded into a tender gauzy mist, And the Pond deepened into amethyst Bright with the mimic sails that flashed upon Its rippling wash; and a faint carillon Of far-off bells blent with the bleating cries Of sheep and children's laughter. The flushed skies Grew crimson with the splendour of the sun Burning the west, and like a vestal nun Pure, cold and white the crescent moon hung high In the mid-heaven, and Venus' flashing eye Watched from the dove-hued south half tremulously. XVII. West of the Serpentine the beeches make Cool shadowy haunts, wherein whene'er they shake Their leaflets to the ground, 'tis like green rain Waving adown from boughs where it has lain Hid from the scorching sunâso cool and green They seem a glade far in some woodland scene Where the birds build and sing and never know Disturbing fears, with near some streamlet slow Meandering with cool lisping sounds, where calls The kingfisher by day, and when dusk falls The moorhen, nightjar and the whistling bat. And in the shadow of those beeches sat Arnold and Lilian, listening without words To the last twilight cries of drowsy birds, And watching the flushed glory of the west Halo the sinking sun that sought his rest Where none could see him, and the golden flow Raiment the palace with a tender glow. XVIII. And when at last the highest elm-tree branch Caught the last gold, and the small waves did blanch Upon the pond into a gloamy grey And the last crimson cloudlet paled away, Each turn'd to each, with gaze that was the gate Wherethrough their souls' speech went, confederate In desire; and then his hand took hers, and still No word was spoken, but an equal thrill Stirred every nerve of each deliciously. At last he spoke, saying, âLilian,â tenderly, âLilian, I love you!â And beneath the tears That dimmed her eyes he saw the promised years Wherewith in love she dower'd him: and life Seemed changed from night to day, to peace from strife; And silence lay between them like a sea Wherein two wandering currents suddenly Meet and unite and no more separate be. XIX. Homeward at length they went when the dusk grew By stealthy shades to night. Each spirit knew The sundering of self when a soul gives Its best to another. The hour that lives Memorial thro' each life that once has loved Had come to them; and as deep pools are moved, Twin depths upon a lone hillside, and stirr'd By the same wind, so at the sudden word Of love both hearts throbbed wildly with the same Divine emotionâthro' each life the flame Already burn'd that yet a pillar of fire Would be from out the wastes of low desire To guide each soul to emprise ever higher. XX. Before the leafless boughs beneath the snow Dreamed of dead summers or the leaves that low The winds had scatter'd were grown wholly old And shrivell'd, and still some lingering gold Shone palely here and there against the haze Of rainy skies in bleak November days, Their lives were joined in one, their streams were blent In one seagoing river! Forth they went With hearts strung high and each soul confident. XXI. Twin married lives hence hand in hand they chose Their paths togetherâfronting whate'er rose Of evil or of sorrow on their way With equal gaze: and ever day by day Their great love deepen'd, as a pine-tree clings Still closer to the rock o'er which it flings Its matted shade heedless of winds that beat Its lonely height: and as the flow'rs make sweet The blessÃ©d days of Spring, that every year Seem to become more wonderful and dear, So little joys and hopes made daily life Seem fair to them, soothing the fret and strife That is the heritage of all. Their love Indeed was life: and dear the joys thereof. Ah, love is not a seed blown heedlessly By any devious wind across the sea That hems us in; a seed that in earth's womb Grows till the day when in its perfect bloom The sun's kiss warms it and its blossoms make A fragrance for the wind to lift and shake Along the tufted grassâtill one day come The frosts of winter when the birds are dumb And the leaves fall'n and dead, when it is blown Seaward again from whence it once had flown,â Blown hence by devious winds, rewhirled again Back to the wastes amid wild wind and rain! Nay, love is not like this: it is the breath That blows across the sterile lands of death; It is the wind that o'er the tropic seas Blows ever in a steadfast changeless breeze; It is not but a dream that in man's sleep Dries up a little while tired eyes that weep Then fades to let the weary day begin, But is the goal that every life must win Or suffer. Love is the immaculate wind That blows across the drifted years behind Our human course, and bloweth far away Beyond the furthest beacons on our way; Eternal round our little finite day. CYCLE IV. OLD AGE'S INHERITANCE. I. Northward long leagues of plain, until the eye Grew wearied with a vast monotony Like that of the far seas, long leagues of plain Grass-cover'd, which for weeks and months had lain Beneath the scorching of the Austral sun, Thirsting with drought: beyond, the sands begun And stretched a dreary desert where nor beast Nor man were often seen. Far to the east Rolled also the long grassy plains, tanned brown And crisp with heat, where the hot sun shone down Day after day, with rays athirst to find Some lingering moistureâwhere no cooling wind Blew ever, save when the lamplike stars swung low From the vast depths of heav'n, and rising slow The moon usurp'd the night; then ofttimes blew A fresh wind steadily, that lately knew The cool breath of the South Pacific seas. West of the loghouse, gum and wattle-trees Rose miles away, and miles beyond them still Dim densely-wooded ranges, hill on hill Cover'd with mint and box and sassafras, White stringy bark and the coarse upland grass. Southward the ground shelved downward to a stream That lispÃ©d through the rushes like a gleam Of beaten silver, shallow, yet that filled The sunken pools where rains of winter spilled Themselves and were not lost: and overshore The grassy plains, but greener, swept once more For half a mile, until like a green sea They laved against a base whence solemnly A vast and ancient forest stretched away. About the house itself, rough-hewn and grey, A lovely creeper, such as stars the trees With large and yellow blossoms that each breeze Casts like gold globes of fragrance o'er the ground, Clung with a wavy tenderness around The stain'd peeled logs; and at one end there grew An English rose that underneath the blue Australian sky gave red blooms full as sweet As the winds kiss in Kent, that loved the heat Of the long day that on the log walls streamed For burning hours. In front dark violets dreamed Of their ancestral haunts in English woods Where the thrush flutes his song and the dove broods Through the green-shadowed noon; with lilies, white And holy as the shining stars of night, Brought also o'er the seas from out the West. Acacias shaded them, in one a nest Where a sweet songbird dwelt and wooed its mate Each spring recurrent with insatiate Heart of music. A wide verandah ran Round half the house, which, whene'er noon began To burn the freshness up, still kept a place Wherein cool airs might wanderâwith the grace Of vine leaves overgrown, that large and green Made a soft, wavy, and delicious screen. II. This was the house which, after years gone by In many wanderings underneath the sky That held the Austral stars, John Armitage At length had built for home; here to old age His last ten years had grown, and here he knew That he would look his last upon the blue Deep skies he lovedânot glad to leave the earth Yet wishing not to shun the soul's rebirth Through the dark womb of death. About him were His children, flowers around his sepulchre Of yearsâand like sweet youngling buds new blown His children's children, who were yet his own To love and cherish. Only she who bore This noble fruit on earth would never more Hear each loved voice say Mother, or take hold Of tiny hands, or in her arms enfold The weary one who slept. She who had been His wife and friend thro' every changing scene Had left him years ago, and in his eyes The silent yearning lay till Paradise Should one day see the lovers meet again. But full of peace he was, and the dull pain Of loss beyond all words lay down so deep In his soul's depths it almost seemed to sleep. III. Life still was full of pleasantness, of peace And calm content: for when his years should cease The record would go down of one whose life Through all the stress and peril of its strife Still stainless was, of one who bravely faced The early dangers of an unknown waste Undaunted through each failure till at last The years that nothing brought but toil were past. IV. The summertide was full, and through the heat The flowers gave up their heavy odours sweet In rich comminglement, as fancies go Wing'd and rich-hued for ever to and fro Amidst the haunted silences that are The realms of reverie, where, like a star Alone in a wan dusk, the soul doth seem The mystic dreamer or itself the dream. V. Since from the wattles, at the break of morn, The joyous magpie sang its lilting scorn For those who waken'd not, The Australian magpie is the sweetest songster, though within limited compass, that one meets with in the Antipodes. till now the noon Had burned itself away and twilight soon Would be the shadow of a finish'd day, The old man had been glad, for far away His flocks and herds were scatter'd o'er the runs Far stretching, and to each one of his sons He had apportioned out an equal share, Feeling the burden of his years a care Best lighten'd now. The busy day being done He rested 'neath his vines, watching the sun The deep blue of the sky to crimson change And golden hang o'er the last purple range. VI. The heat still made a silence everywhere, Save when, at intervals, the startled air Shook with the laughter of the mocking-bird One of the names of the mopoke, or laughing-jackass. Strident and harsh: or when afar was heard Once only the shy lyre-bird's voice from deep Within the forest, where the stream did sleep. VII. And as a dream before him his past life Moved in a visionâall the toil and strife, Adventure, love, and sorrow, and death and all That fate had brought: and heard dead voices call Like faint sweet echoes from a distant world. He saw the day on which the sails were furl'd Upon the ship that lay in port at last, And how his eager wandering eyes were cast Upon the new strange land: and how the days And weeks went by until he sought the ways That led due north thro' almost trackless bush Till far from men, and still did onward push Until before his eyes the unclaimed plains Lay stretched for leagues, and saw the winter rains Fill up the lonely stream with floods that would Outlast the drought. And how the years went, rude And rough, but happy, often stirred and thrilled With danger;âtill all things being fulfilled That he had hoped for, one week he rode down To the far distant port, already a town Where he had seen but huts, and to his side Clasped one he welcomed as his promised bride Come over seas to join him. And how sweet The after years slid by on rapid feet Joy-wing'd: for ever their love grew and grew From year to year, unchanging, deep, and true. VIII. And how at last a dreadful day there came When she he loved lay dying, and the flame Of life slow flicker'd to its certain end. Above the dear dead face his lips did blend To take one farewell kiss, and then he rode Far through the bush to bear alone his load Of bitter anguish, and to let his tears Flow for the vanish'd sweetness of his years. IX. 'Twas the full tide of summer, and the days Were sated with the cloudless, changeless blaze Of the fierce sun: but close to a small pool Of running water, shaded by the cool O'erarching tree-fern fronds, they made a grave Lonely and sacred as where sea-depths lave The coral beds where pale drown'd mariners lie. The vast primeval forest roundâthe high Deep dome above, the wondrous stars at night And the strange glory of the moon's soft lightâ These watched and brooded o'er her grave, and kept An endless watch above her where she slept. X. A lyre-bird sang a low melodious song Far off, then ceased: a soft wind swept along The lofty gums and breathless died away: And Silence woke and knew her dream was day. XI. Hush, from the trackless depths comes what sweet sound Ineffable! Do spirits underground In hollow caverns ring phantasmal chimes For elfin deaths in faery sunless climesâ Or does some sad aerial spirit high In serene air suspend the listening sky With sweet remember'd music of joy-bells Changing for death? Hush! how it swells and swells Still sweet and low and sad,âas tho' the peal Were chimed in forest-depths where never steal Sounds from the world beyond, and where no noise Breaks ever the long dream. It was the voice Of the mysterious bird whose bell-like note Chimes through the Austral noon as church bells float O'er lonely slopes and pastures far at home: Sometimes but once it sang, as when the foam On northern seas sleeps on the ebbing tide And scarcely stirs the Inchcape's sounding side To one faint clang: then ceased: then once again Tolled out with silver sweetness its part pain, Part reverie over some belovÃ©d thing: At last it too was still, recovering Some dream to brood upon with voiceless peace. To each who listen'd there a calm surcease Of sorrow came, and in each aching breast There was a sense of toil foregone, of rest. XII. Before him these dead years and joys repassed, Watching the sun go down. His thoughts at last Brooded upon his spirit's imminent flight From life, when unto him the eclipsing night Would come with shrouds impenetrably dark. Yet death he feared not: whether his soul's barque Should sail the infinite deeps knowing no end, Or to some far, far strand its course should tend Whereon at last to rest and voyage no more, Or whether it should founder ere the shore Of any goal be seen, he cover'd o'er For ever by the waves of death,ânot less Would he thank God for the great happiness Of having lived at all. Why should man seek That which his soul might find itself too weak To bearâGod's own supreme eternity? Shall not the cycles or the Ã¦ons be Enough for him,âhis spirit find a goal At last? Nay, whether the tried human soul Lives out new lives on earth again alone, Or speeds triumphant far beyond the zone Of that which we call Time till, Ã¦ons pass'd, It finds its ultimate goal and rest at last, Or whether it eternal is, with Him Whom we half think we see, our eyes being dim, It still is well. In each alone His breath Would be the Lord of life, the Lord of death. XIII. Such were his thoughts this last day of the year Waning 'mid summer heats instead of clear Cold skies and frost and icy northern wind. At last the sun's flames burned right out behind The furthest range; a strange delicious blue Hung o'er the south and west, as spirits drew Thin filmy veils of azure gossamer Out of the depths of heav'n and trailed them where The great gums spread their branches thro' the air. XIV. But ere the short and shadowy twilight came The bush was no more still: each tree became Alive with sound, and the cool dusky skies Shrill with the shrieks of parrots and the cries Of crested cockatoos and parrakeets In thousands, swarming from their green retreats, With over all the hoarse and chuckling sounds From laughing-birds; and when with mighty bounds The kangaroos fled far in sudden fright There swelled the dingo's howl. In the cool light The fierce cicalas whirred their deafening noise From ev'ry bole, and oft a querulous voice Told where opossums hid: with resonant hum The grey mosquitoes wheeled around each gum Ceaseless and fierce: and not until had come The night itself grew all the clamour dumb. XV. Slowly the vast round Austral moon became The glory of the night: and each a flame Purple, or blue, or white, the stars hung low From blue-black skies. Serene, and calm, and slow The last night of the year to death did go. XVI. And when the faint flush of the newborn day Quiver'd above the wan horizon grey And deepen'd tenderly, the soul of one Whose years of patient waiting were all done Greeted with happy gaze the glad New Year Far hence. At last he now would meet the dear Expectant eyes, and feel the longed-for kiss Once more upon his lips foretell of bliss. XVII. The rosy dawn still deepen'd steadily, Till of a sudden all the eastern sky O'er brimmed with gold: and from a wattle-tree A magpie sang the new year's jubileeâ High, sweet, and clear the silver music trilled As though the singer's heart with joy was overfilled. THE NEW HOPE. (A VISION OF THE TRAVAIL OF HUMANITY.) In these dark days of storm and stress and strife That wand'ring Man, whom some strange fate hath curs'd With blinded vision 'mid the glory of life,â Where the clear blaze of light should else have burst Upon him with its splendour from the first, Cheering his wayward pathâstill strives to find Soul's egress from the gath'ring gloom behind: Still strives, despite strange dreams that chill the soul, And deadening weight of countless centuries, And baffled hopes that lead to some false goal, And mighty yearnings and triumphant cries Drown'd deep amid unspeakable agonies, And ages, breaking in a glorious dawn, Setting 'midst desolation bleak and wan; Still strives against the mist of some strange doom That shrouds the universe to find a way That, twisting thro' the stars, doth reach the womb Of all creation, where the omnipotent sway Of central life with unbeclouded ray For ever triumphs, and the Hand that wakes The spheres harmonic perfect music makes. Dimly he knows an unremember'd past Wherein he had an unknown birth afar In those great deeps of time which reach at last Those utmost years, when earth, a flaming star, Quiver'd in heaven like a blood-red scar, And the moon belched her fires, and higher spun The huge mass of th' intolerable sun. Deep in the dark abyss of primal years He shudder'd into life, and groped with hands Uncertain up creation's gradual tiers Until a day when sovereign he stands And knows for his the mighty youthful lands, And views the seas break with an alien roar, But laughs and names them his for evermore. Dimly in vague uncertain dreams he knows How long unnumber'd centuries have rolled Above him with their tide of savage woes, Dim years, whose hoary memories enfold Strange secrets mortal tongue hath never toldâ Beginnings vast, portentous, and sublime With Titan-struggles towards a fuller time. And later still, but not less vague, he dreams Of elder days in the vast Asian plain Fed by the waters of forgotten streams, When tribal hordes appeared and gather'd grain Where only desert sands before had lain; Till, growing to mighty hosts, they spread to where, Southward and westward, new lands seem'd more fair. Where in those dim and twilight lands the soul Woke slowly to the secret of the stars, Till Godhood shone from midnight pole to pole; And in the fiery flash of burning Mars Prophets beheld God's summons to new wars, And every circling moon that made the plains Whiter than snow heard the wild priests' refrains, Wild songs of warlike worship, and swift prayer Snatching at hope, and burning sacrifice, And maidens with their wealth of desert hair About them floating, in their dream-fill'd eyes The victim ecstasy when the deep skies Rang to fanatic tumult, with sweet breath Chanting the god whose secret name was Death. When, 'mid the desert cities before dawn The wild-eyed priests with long rejoicing call Summon'd the faithful thro' the silent, wan, Grey, twilight morning to the eastern wall To wait, till one great moment saw them fall Prostrate in worship,âand above the sands The sun-god rose with blessing for all lands. Dimly man these remembers: scarce less faint The solemn morning of Egyptian years; The long lost glory and the deathless taint Of lustful Pharaohs, and the countless tears That fed the Nile from unremember'd biers Of sun-scorched, whip-lashed slaves, by whose deathtoil The slow wise Sphinxes crown'd the barren soil To look for aye with superhuman gaze Across th' inhabitable waste of sand, And see, mayhap, far off these latter days,â And, farther still, some mighty moulding Hand Shape the predestined fate of every landâ And seeing, speak notâonly, far off, where The sands fade wave-like, watch with steadfast stare: And far removed from all the busy strife Of populous cities dwelling by the Nile, How the great Pyramids, through human life Incalculable, 'neath the cold calm smile Of Ramses, grew, and watch'd mile after mile Whiten each year with myriad human bones, And heard whole generations pass in groans. Faintly afar he hears the throbbing chant Of worshippers by old forgotten fanes, Harsh cymbals clashing, and fierce breaths that pant From dusky maidens madden'd by wild strainsâ Tall brown-skinned maidens from the burning plains, With breasts sun-moulded, and with shadowy eyes Inheritors of Egypt's mysteries. Where swart Assyria swelters 'neath the sun He lists the anguish of the priests of Baal; He sees the chamber sacred unto One, Where daily sounds a low ecstatic wail From maiden beautiful, rapt, naked, paleâ The bride of Godâyet yearning with fierce fire For mortal love's unsatisfied desire: As in a dream he sees tumultuous hosts Spread locust-wise o'er devastated lands, And swarthy warriors bathe by Red Sea coasts: He hears the clamour of battle on the sands, And the swords swing in fierce delirious hands, And in the purple air sees pennons fly Scarlet, as dipped in blood of those that die. Dimly these bygone memories return, As to the full-grown man the faint far days Of childhood in his recollection burn Faint as the glow-worm's lamp on moonlit waysâ A few brief visions cross again his gaze, But still the silent ages that have been, Silent remain behind an unpierced screen. At times his eyes in backward vision strained Behold more clear the phantoms of the past, When mighty kings of shadowy memories reigned And each great teacher's utterance was cast Like seed abroadâas fruitful seed to last From scatter'd sowing till maturing days Found golden-fruited boughs in every place. His inward-looking eyes thus view once more, Where in the almond blossom scented air The white pagodas line each river shore, A vast assemblage list with wond'ring stare New solemn accents fall from lips that dare The wrath of troubled priests,âand the clear voice Confucian call, âNo more in dreams rejoice!â Like far-off swallows, striving rest to gain In long-pursued and ever-fleeing spring, Winging their flight o'er sea and desolate plain From winter's frown to where glad song-birds sing All day and night 'mid sweet lands blossomingâ So sped the mighty teacher's word-wing'd thought Afar beyond where wrangling priests still fought. For as a runlet bubbling from a hill Struggles thro' moss and rocky channell'd steeps Till one day all its waters shiver and thrill As far below the shining ocean sleeps, And crown'd with spray with one great cry it leaps From earth-chain'd life to that maternal breast Where every seaward river findeth rest: So wends by slow degrees and tortuous way New truth's thin streamlet thro' far-scattered minds, Till soon or late there dawns a pregnant day Borne on the wings of revolution winds, And the scant streamlet widening leaps and finds Its waves wash fruitful teeming lands at last And roll a highway to the ocean vast. Or, deeper still, he sees that ancient Ind Where empires grew, religions wax'd and waned Leaving faint cloudy memories behind, Till of these also no dim trace remainedâ Till, like a wave that gathers waves, there gain'd The mighty soul of Buddha devotees From Cashmere snows to distant Cingal seas. He views some silent windless twilight die And fade into a sultry moonlit eve: Above, the purple shaded star-lamped skyâ Beneath, the Ganges, whose swift waters leave An utter'd echo of old thoughts that grieveâ And, rising o'er the sands that shelve its tide, Great shadow-haunted palms dream side by side. Seated thereby, a man with far-off eyes That pierce the darkness lying beyond death, Speaks low with fervent words divinely wiseâ And, as the final word he uttereth, The silent audience, like a pent up breath, Once more are conscious of the earthly air: They look again, and Buddha is not thereâ He hath passed by; and every conscious star Leaps in the heavens as if his gaze to meet; He passes thro' the jungle, and afar The tiger growls within his grim retreat, But stirs not; the immeasurably sweet And midnight music of the nightingale In quivering worship greets him sad and pale. Godhood is visible to natural things More clear than to the soulâthe woods that dream Become vast choirs shaking their green-branch'd wings Angelic, and every forest stream Lifts up its chiming murmurs, and the gleam That is earth's smile grows more divinely bright, Burning with fire of spiritual light. The many-colour'd memories that haunt The long-undwelt-in mansions of man's mind Point westward now: across the Hellespont His spirit strives the chain'd past to unbind; Palm-shadow'd mystic Ind grows faint behind, And, rising over the rejoicing sea, Greece, sun-crown'd, standsâserene, and great, and free: The storied fame of all the old-world hills Is made apparent: double-peak'd Parnassus Doth skyward dream, the white air slowly fills With sweet blown scents from off Pentelicus, And the bees hum in violet-loved Hymettus, Olympus guards green Tempe, and the dawn Rests like a band of gold on Helicon. Clearest he sees the sovereign city rise, Queenlike and glorious in her ancient state: The Parthenon, supreme beneath the skies; The marble-pillar'd theatre where the great Thunder of Ãschylus bared the vault of Fate; And, with a deathless splendour such as his, The flow'r-like glory of the Acropolis. As one who dreams, and sees a great fair land Spread out before him, watching with pleasur'd eyes Mountain, and stream, and forest ever fann'd By exile minstrel winds from the blue skies, And far seas moaning for lost Paradise In sad eternal music (for these keep That deathless secret in their utmost deep)â Starts suddenly, and sees a face he knows Grow into light that makes the rest a dreamâ So, dreamlike, from man's vision backward flows The old Greek glory, like a fading beam O' the moon before the dawn's first amber gleam,â And, fixt, his concentrated vision sees The broad brows of the clear-eyed Socrates. Seated amid great dusky olive shades, That move reluctant 'neath the breathless trees Till 'mid wild rose and honeysuckle glades They hide and dream, and fann'd by the cool breeze That from the white foam-crested sounding seas Bloweth with briny odours, he doth rest And muse on life and deathâand which is best. The great wind of the human spirit blew Thro' this Greek soul, which organ-like gave birth To clear majestic notes of music new, And, from the old compound of sorrow and mirth, Wrought a new scheme of God, and man, and earth: Through him it blew such mighty harmonies His voice still sounds adown the centuries. The weary soul of man finds rest in these, The lives he lived to in his earliest days,â Whether his wing'd thought with brave pinions flees To that far past half lost to human gaze When the soul of Egypt, weary with men's frays And blood and anguish, hid with all her lore In the great Sphinx she stares from evermoreâ Or whether, later still (and like the dove From seas alighting on green olive boughs) Resting with him whose heart of boundless love Made all the Orient echo with its vowsâ Or circling round the fate-confronting brows (A swallow finding spring) of him who drank With cheerful soul the cup of hemlock rank. These bring him peace, these names awaken hope; But still his spirit knows another name: A later star this rose upon life's slope, Later, but fuller; yet the Syrian's fame Rose from an unknown birth, a death of shame Rounded it offâand though he is long dead His voice still peals like thunder overhead. Man feels him still, and knows him not a dream Dreamt in forgotten daysâno empty breath Blown out with unheld meanings, but a stream As of white light upon black seas of deathâ Or as a glad great living voice that saith The one word Water, where 'mid burning sands Men famish'd yearn with scorched beseeching hands. He still is part man's present. It may be The unborn years slow forming in Time's womb Shall rise and live and fade successively And know him not, save as a prophet whom Past ages worshipp'd as the Lord of Doomâ A bodiless echo sounding thro' all time Some meaningless message that was once sublime: Thus may it be: meanwhile man's spirit is A wind-harp answering to the Nazarene: Man is a beach where the sea's mysteries Are whisper'd low, or thunder'd through a screen Of white mysterious foamâwhere God is seen A waving arm about a dream of eyes: A fluctuant sea beneath Christ's wind man lies. The human soul still shudders with the sob That thrill'd the dusk of drear Gethsemane, The bitter cry no lapsing years can rob From sorrow wedded to eternity; That garden dreamed a vast futurity, That weary night, of fierce successive woesâ Of good men's scorn, and pitiless hate of foes. Man turns with weary gaze and looks again Into his troubled past: his tired eyes see A calm shore fringed with dead wind-echoing cane, And tall flags swaying in hushful Galilee; A bittern booms his sad call sullenly, And, with an hourly pain, a plover's cry Wails like a wailing soul thrust from God's sky: The yellow moon, half drown'd in deep dark blue, With still remaining crescent curves a trace Of gold upon the vast profound; a few Great stars, heavy with changeful sphere-fires, gaze To the lake's utmost depths, and in the bays Seem to lie panting, as when side by side Great water-lilies move in a moving tide: One sits on the dim shore as though his sight Held not familiar things of wave or land; His eyes burn slowly with some inner light Of scarce hid glory, and his listless hand Traces his central thought upon the sand Till the scooped grains read God, and then Father, and Infinite Love, and for all men. He stirs once at the desolate bittern's boom, And prays for man: when the wild plover cries, His heart throbs with the mystery of Doom: And when the windless twilight water sighs, The tears grow slowly in his human eyes,â He sees the scourge, the cross, the hyssop rod, Death, and the graveâbeyond, the glory of God! Such are the dreams man knows have made his life: And yet, his youth and boyhood past away, His manhood finds him still at endless strife, And life unrounded by a fuller day; Faiths rise, and live, and flourish, and decay; And, as a helmless ship by every wind Blown here and there, so seems man's baffled mind. His years have seen him oftâas some tired ox Stops wearily by some delicious rain Of clear spring water hid by ferns and rocks From the rough highway dust, and so again On with long aching miles until its pain Sinks at some similar fount one glad time moreâ Cease from the weary road he travelleth o'er And rest with such as Buddha, such as Christ; Rest with them, live with them, hope with them, be A sharer in each old joy sacrificed; Think with their mighty searching thought, and see With their clear eyes beyond mortalityâ Then suddenly find all things vain, and rise And stagger forward blind-like 'neath blank skies. He hath been as a man with toil aweary Yet mocked by baffling sleep upon his bed, And sometimes eased with dreams wherein no dreary Phantoms of hideous days and years stain'd red Stare ever at him, and no fair hopes dead Rise ghost-like weeping, and no more in pain Old aspirations move white lips again. The fair dream stirs and fades away, as breaks A soft young cloud before the ruthless windâ And as the cloud in snowy feathery flakes Weeps towards the earth for ravish'd life behind, So the sweet dream dispell'd can no more find Joy in itself, but melts in bitter tears And is a dream no more for coming years. Fair hopes for ever baffled, and the way Of life as hard to climb!âthus grim Despair With fixt immoveable lips that never pray Walks by his side unchidden:âev'rywhere The wide world throbs with life, the summer air Palpitates with the outsung souls of birds, The milk-time lowing of the sweet-breath'd herds Sounds from the meadows, from the windless fir The cushat calls, and somewhere, as a voice Heard in a dream, the cuckoo's note doth stir The high-air silence, with a humming noise The wild bees haunt the clover, and rejoice The heaven-loving larks half lost to view, Small founts of song in the still sea of blue, And sea, and wind, and hill, and flow'r, and grass Make up with separate music one great choir: And then Despair says, âFool, all these things pass To nothingness, as stubble in the fire Doth wholly burnâand deeper still and higher The woman Vanitas with blank cold eyes Scans deepest depths and sweeps the utmost skies âAnd sees nought there save ever day and night A faceless Shadow move, that with cold hands Incessantly draws back from the dear light Some living thing, a bird from forest-lands, A leaping fish, a lizard on the sands, A babe from its young mother, and the breath From a great soulâand this, O man, is Death!â And at these words man looks with tearless eyes And hearkens with deaf ears: heav'n's song-fill'd vault Is loud with discord; the divine surprise Of the sun's advent hath some hidden fault; The mighty morning winds no more exalt The wondrous regions that were once their own: And, knowing this, man answers with a moan. At times he turns and looks with steadfast gaze Into the coward eyes of the drear shape That with him toils the intolerable ways And all the earth with hopelessness doth drape,â And then the shadow fades, and swift escape To all the glory and splendour of the earth Man makes againâa veritable new birth. And often now in the great peaceful calm Of early mornings some faint distant song He seems to hearâas though an echoed psalm From heaven adown the gold clouds waved along, Or distant angel-wings bore up the wrong And misery of the world to where griefs die And wake in rapture singing through the sky. He hears, and young hope stirs within his heart, A fledgeling bird that dare not rise as yet On untried wings thro' the chill air to dart: He cannot quite the bitterness forget Of all the ended dreams that he hath met On life's long pilgrimageâthus hardly dares To hope again as on his way he fares. But day by day the Christ-dream changing takes A grander form: no longer in the past The Saviour dwellsâhis voice afar off makes A music deep, as of an organ-blast Fill'd with harmonious prophesying vast:â Twin souls divided, seeking each the other, One calling God, and one crying ever Brother. Man's soul is as a pine upon a height Fronting dim seasâat times each branch a lyre Of morning music, when the golden light Waves round its boughs with unconsuming fire, And soft-wing'd winds re-echo the desire Of each lark's song, and all the world seems fair With the eyes of summer smiling ev'rywhere: And later, when the evening mists have crept Up the steep slopes, it sigheth wearily; A slow sound breaks as though each tired wave wept A wailing child upon the mother sea; A cold wind strikes its chill'd wings suddenly But doth not take the air; and some vague woe Through each strong bough doth with a tremor go: Then comes the dark; and the tempestuous deep Lashes the height with spray, and wild winds cry With dreadful voicesâtill its branches leap And beat the air with suppliant agony, While Death stares down from the deserted sky; And somewhere in the darkness seems to grope A searching voice that moans âThere is no hope!â Thus joy, despondency, and deep despair Alternate with him: yet each new year brings A growing strength the ways of Fate to bear: A great hope deepens with successive springs That somewhere Truth, the highest angel, sings A great glad song that, hearkening, man shall find His eyes grown clear, and be no longer blind. One truth, more old than the time-honour'd hills, More ancient than the hoary ancient sea, Before the world was, or the sun that fills The world with day, or in the vast, blank, free Space of heaven the first star fierily Burn'd thro' the dark and silenceâone great Word That spake, shall wonderfully again be heard. Beyond the wheeling atom of the earth, Beyond the utmost sun that lights this sun, A vision of life in some divine new birth Where seed of man and breath of God are one, And the old blind groping is for ever doneâ This breaks upon man's sightâhis fret and strife Sink at this vision'd glory of new life. Beyond himself, beyond the human soul, Farther than Christ or Christ's own farthest love, The source of life, that makes the ages roll To vast sad music till at last they move Crown'd and triumphant to new birth above, Dimly man now discerns, with eager eyes Lit with the light of some divine surprise: And with the vision, as a tall tree sways All blossom'd o'er, with mingled love and awe His whole soul blooms into the flower of praiseâ Not for the working of some great cold law, But that great truth beyond the petty flaw Of human doubtâthat mighty love, whose breath, Whose gift to life is never-dying death,â Eternal change, no stagnant blissful dream! Forth from the life supreme man's spirit went: He hath gone thro' the darkness till the gleam Of light at last shines on him well-nigh spent: Rest shall he have, as earthly sleep is sent, To make new life more dear; then onward still 'Neath the clear light of the omnipotent will! There is no deathless lifeâbut blessÃ©d death Kisses the soul asleep, that when at last It wakes again with new triumphant breath It heeds no more the weary toilsome past: Thus shall it be until the Ã¦ons vast Draw man so nigh to God no human sight Can farther pierce th' ineffable great light. Thus, dark and gloom behind, but light before, Man takes new strength. The lights of past times grow Fainter and fainter, but afar doth soar A vaster gloryâas when from the low Sea-wash'd horizon with a motion slow The full moon rises, and each lesser star Seems by a gentle hand withdrawn afar. MOTHERHOOD. PART I. I Beneath the awful full-orb'd moon The silent tracts of wild rice lay Dumb since the fervid heart of noon Beat thro' the burning Indian day; And still as some far tropic sea Where no winds murmur, no waves be. II The bended seeded tops alone Swayed in the sleepy sultry wind, Which came and went with frequent moan As though some dying place to find; While at sharp intervals there rang The fierce cicala's piercing clang. III Deep 'mid the rice-field's green-hued gloom A tigress lay with birth-throes ta'en; Her swaying tail swept o'er her womb As if to sweep away the pain That clutched her by the gold-barred thighs And shook her throat with snarling cries. IV Her white teeth tore the wild-rice stems; And as she moaned her green eyes grew Lurid like shining baleful gems With fires volcanic lighten'd through, While froth fell from her churning jaws Upon her skin-drawn gleaming claws. V As in a dream at some strange sound The soul doth seem to freeze, so she Lay fixt like marble on the ground, Changed in a moment: suddenly, A far-off roar of savage might Boomed through the silent sultry night. VI Her eyes grew large and flamed with fire; Her body seemed to feel the sound And thrill therewith, as thrills a lyre When wild wind wakes it with a bound And sweeps its string-clasp'd soul along In waves of melancholy song. VII Her answering howl swept back again And eddied to her far mate's ear; Then once again the travail pain Beat at the heart that knew no fear But some new instinct seem'd to rise And yearn and wonder in her eyes. VIII Did presage of the coming birth Light up her life with mother-love, As winds along the morning earth Whisper of golden dawn above? Or was it but some sweet wild thought Remember'd vaguely e'er forgot? IX Some sweet wild thought of that still night When underneath the low-lying moon, Vast, awful, in its splendour whiteâ Two tigers fought for love's last boon:â Two striped and fire-eyed terrors strove Through blood and foam to reach her love? X Of how their fight so deathly still Fill'd all her heart with savage glee; The lust to love, to slay, to kill,â The fierce desire with him to be Whose fangs all bloody from the fray Should turn triumphantly away: XI Of how at last with one wild cry One gript the other's throat and breath, And, with hell gleaming thro' each eye, Shook the wild life to loveless death; Then stood with waving tail and ire Triumphant changed to swift desire? XII But once again the bitter strife Of wrestling sinews shook her there; And soon a little mewling life Met her bewildered yearning stare; Till, through her pain, the tigress strove With licking tongue her love to prove. XIII No longer fearless flamed the light Of great green eyes straight thro' the gloom, Each nerve seem'd laden with affright, The eyes expectant of some doom; The very moonlight's steady glare Beat hungrily about her lair. XIV A beetle rose, and hummed, and hung A moment ere it fledâbut great In face of peril to her young The tigress rose supreme in hate And, with tail switching and lips drawn, The unreal foe scowled out upon. XV And when a mighty cobra, coiled Amid the tangled grass roots near, Hissed out his hunger, her blood boiled With rage that left no room for fear, Till, with a howl that shook the dark, She sprang and left him cold and stark. XVI But when a feeble hungry wail Smote on her yearning ears she turn'd With velvet paws and refluent tail And eyes that no more flashed and burn'd But flamed throughout the solemn night Like lamps of soft sweet yellow light XVII To where her young was; where she lay Silent, and full of some strange love Long hours. Along the star-strewn way A comet flashed and flamed above, And where great wastes of solemn blue Spread starless sailed the vast moon through. XVIII No sound disturb'd the tigress, save Stray jackals, or some wild boar's pant Where thickest did the tall rice wave, Or trump of distant elephant; Or, when these fill'd the night no more, The tiger's deep tremendous roar. PART II. I Vast, solitary, gloomful, dark, Primeval forests swept away To where the gum and stringy bark Against great granite mountains lay; And through their depths the twilight stole And dusk'd still deeper each dark bole. II Deep in their pathless tracts there reared A huge white gum, whose giant height When winds infrequent blew appeared To brush the stars out from the night: A mighty column straight and vast, Solemn with immemorial past. III And at its base upon a bed Of fern-tree leaves strewn o'er the ground A woman lay as though lying deadâ Dark, rigid, still, without one sound: Her fixt eyes lifted not, nor saw The great stars tremble in strange awe. IV Couch'd near upon the tufted grass Two wither'd long-haired women bent Two dusky bodies. No sign was Made ever them between, nor went From swift, slant, startled eyes a glance To break the spell of their deep trance. V They crouch'd with heads bent down between Thin, black, uprisen knees; their hair Hid their dark faces like a screen, And, scored with thorns, their feet lay bare: Hour after hour had watched them so, Three shadows fixt in sphinx-like woe. VI At times some wand'ring parrot's voice Clanged through the dusk; from dead trees nigh A locust whirred its deafening noise And shrill'd th' opossum's frequent cry; And hour by hour some slim snake stole Hissing from fallen rotting bole. VII At last, above the farthest range, The full vast moon sail'd o'er the trees: The dead-like woman felt some change Thrill through her body: from her knees Each shadowy watcher raised her head, And stared with eyes of moveless dread. VIII Beyondâwithin the ghostly shade Of time-forgotten gums aglow With phosphorescent light that made Each trunk burn taper-like,âbent low, A savage, bearded and long-haired, Wild-eyed across the pale gloom stared: IX And when his shifting restless eyes Caught the drawn woman's birth-time pang, He shrill'd a wild yell to the skies And high with tossing arms upsprang, Beating with eager blows a drum And shivering with some terror dumb: X The list'ning women once again Shudder'd and grew more chill with fearâ Not at the harsh drum's maddening strain But at the spirits that were near, The awful souls of hated dead That creep round each wild travail-bed; XI The white-eyed sheeted things that steal Down dusky ways and lie in wait And from the shade their death-darts wheel And wreak unseen their deathless hate:â For these the fierce drum clanged and beat The summons of a swift retreat. XII What strange thoughts wander'd thro' the mind Of her who writhed in travail sore? As, bearing scents and sounds, a wind Blows pregnant from some distant shore, So may have blown some wind of thought Memorious from a past forgot, XIII Drifting across her yearning eyes Stray visions of lost happy days, And filling with strange vague surprise The dreary sameness of her gazeâ Dim sweet memorial hours long lost, Scorched by long suns, numbed by long frost. XIV But soon the wafted breaths that blew From off the deep drown'd past were blown Aside before some sharp wind new Of sudden agony. A moan Shook on her lips, and from her womb A new life crept to outer gloom. XV The watching women rose and went With deft hands unto her: the man Hush'd his tempestuous instrument, And with fleet silent footsteps ran To where, asleep in moonlight, lay Some huts rough built from branches stray: XVI And soon thereafter, in the light Of the vast moon, the tribe stole out And fill'd with cries the startled nightâ Till, with claspt hands and one wild shout, They circled round the riven frame Of her whose blank eyes knew no shame. XVII But as some feeble strength came back She stretched out thin and claw-like hands, With eyes as one who on a rack Yearns for mercy, or on strange lands Lifts outspread arms towards his ownâ So yearn'd she with a mother's moan. XVIII Within her famish'd eyes no more The hunger of the body burned, But on the fruit her womb long bore Their light unspeakable was turned: And all the hunger of her love Lighten'd the child's eyes from above. XIX Vast, solitary, gloomful, dark, Primeval forests swept away To where the gum and stringy bark Against the granite mountains lay: Till, as the great moon grew more wan, Stirred the first heart-beats of the dawn. XX And o'er the pathless tracts where reared The huge white gum, whose boughs had seen The woman's birth-throes, light appeared And lit its leaves with golden green, And shone upon the straight trunk vast, Solemn with immemorial past. PART III. I Faint scent of lilies filled the room, Hush'd in sweet silence and asleep Within the dim delicious gloom: No windy lamp-flame strove to leap Amidst the moveless shade, but faint A soft light burned from censer quaint. II And dimly through the gloom loomed large A carven bed that seem'd to sail Like ghost of some great funeral barge 'Mid shadow seas no men might hailâ Till from its depths suffused with night The wan sheets dreamed to gleaming white. III And lo, half hid, like some white flow'r Breasting the driven snow, there lay Expectant of the awful hour A waiting girl, who, far away Beyond where vision reacheth, gazed With eyes by some strange glory dazed. IV Like two strange dreams they were, wherein Played subtle lights of other life, Deep depths, scarce cognisant of sin, Serene, beyond all clamorous strifeâ Two seas unsoundable as night Yet lit to utmost depths with light. V Silent she lay, as one who low In some dim vast deserted nave Bends rapt in mingled love and woe While the wild passionate sweeping wave Of organ music sweeps and rolls,â The burden of all suffering souls. VI Silent she lay, for as a palm Within a thirsty desert feels A low wind break the deathly calm And drinks each rain-drop as it steals Between its dry parch'd leaves, so she Felt God's breath fill her fitfully. VII The soft low wind of life divine Entered the darkened womb, and there It cleft the mystic bands that twine The folded bud of childhood fair, Which, as an open'd lily, fell From death to life's strange miracle. VIII O perfect bud of human flow'r Immaculately sweet and pure, Shall God's first influence in this hour Through all thy coming life endure, And thou expand to perfect bloom Untouched by crash of neighbouring doom? IX Or, O sweet perfect human bud, Shall rains thee dash, and wild winds sweep Thy fair head to the mire and mud, And, with praying hands, thy mother weep Such tears of anguish as no pain Shall ever wring from her again? X Soft, soft, the wind of life doth breathe:â Some angel surely fans the while The faint new-litten spark beneath, And prayeth with a piteous smile That it may live, and living be A victor 'midst humanity. XI Silent she lay who soon should give This life to life: her secret thought Strove mid the happy past to live Again that day she ne'er forgot, That day when her young love took wing From maidenhood's sweet-scented Spring: XII When hand in hand she trod the ways Flow'r-strewn with him, and felt his eyes Turn'd full on her with such deep gaze Of love triumphant that the skies Seem'd but a hollow dome where rang Sweet tumult, as though angels sang: XIII How the hush'd drowsy afternoon Slipt through the summertide, till low In the dark tranquil east the moon Rose vast and yellow, and more slow The flaming star that lights the west Lulled the sea-waters to their rest: XIV How in the bridal chamber shone No other than the full-moon's light, And how between the dusk and dawn A wind of passion fill'd the night And bore resistless soul with soul On to love's utmost crowning goal. XV Silent she was, but as her mind Made real once more that perfect day Her body trembled, as a wind Had blown upon her where she lay, And in her eyes serene and deep Joys unforgotten woke from sleep. XVI As on a mighty midnight sea Wind-swept, and lit by a white glare Where intermittent lightnings flee And deafened by the thunderous air Split up with tumult, one great wave Doth rise and scorn an ocean-grave, XVII And, gath'ring volume as it rolls, Doth sweep triumphant till at last It thunders up the sounding shoals Of stricken promontory aghast, And leaves its crown of foam where high The cliffs stare seaward steadily:â XVIII So from love's throbbing pulsing sea All lightning-lit by passion, reared A mighty wave resistlessly Of mother-love, which as it neared Fulfilment broke in one glad cry Of sweet half-wond'ring ecstasy. XIX Hush! the great sea is still, and low The night-wind wanders; hush, for calm The mother waits the body's woe! Silent she lay; mayhap a psalm Of sacred joy sang deep within The maiden heart unstained by sin. XX Mayhap the inward vision saw The unborn soul arise and stand Great in a people's love and awe, Crown'd not with gold by human hand But sacred with the bays that wait The victor in the strife of Fate: XXI And, deeper still, beheld afar The billows of the ages sweep A mightier soul from star to starâ So ever upwards thro' the steep Dim ways of God's unfathom'd will But aye by fuller periods still. So shall it be for ever: evermore The mystic chain of mother-love shall twine Around the world, and link these three again. TRANSCRIPTS FROM NATURE. (NOTE.) The form of expression I have adopted for these Transcripts (the following being but a portion of a series forming a kind of private Liber Studiorum) is founded on the Tuscan Rispetto. âThis,â to quote Mr. J. A. Symonds' definition, âis the name commonly given throughout (Tuscan) Italy to short poems, varying from six to twelve lines, constructed on the principle of the octave stanza. That is to say, the first part of the rispetto consists of four or six lines with alternate rhymes, while one or more couplets, called the ripresa, complete the poem.â In broadly adopting the rispetto as the most fitting means of expression for my purpose, I have made the first part uniformly consist of six octosyllabic lines, not with alternate rhymes but rhyming a, b, b, a, c, c, and have detached the ripresa (d, d) therefrom, intending it as a rule to be the means of some supplementary touch, heightening the effect by bearing in some way or other upon the broad outline produced in the preceding six lines. I. SUNRISE ABOVE BROAD WHEAT-FIELDS. The pale tints of the twilight fields Have turned into burnished gold, For waves of yellow light have rolled From the open'd east across the wealds; While 'mid the wheat spires far behind Stirs lazily the awaken'd wind. A skylark high (a song made bird) Sings as though God his singing heard. II. THE STONE-BREAKER. He stoops all bent and bowed and worn With arm uplifted o'er the stones: Each stone is as the poor heart's moans, Each stroke one less to that drear morn When he too, broken, cast aside, Shall die with no one by his side. The glow of the red sun makes all The landscape one fierce lurid pall. III. WILD-ROSES. Against the dim hot summer blue Yon wave of white wild-roses lies, Watching with listless golden eyes The green leaves shutting out their view, The tiny leaves whose motions bright Are like small wings of emerald light: White butterflies like snow-flakes fall And brown bees drone their honey-call. IV. LIGHT OF THE SETTING SUN ON MOUNTAIN-ASH BERRIES. The flame of the September sun Streams backward from its western bed; The countless berries overhead (Above me where I rest) have won A crown of glory such as shone Never upon King Solomon: O'er the horizon spreads a floodâ The selfsame hueâsome dead god's blood. V. PINE-WOODS. (Silence.) Tall, dark, majestically stern, With something in their solemn mien Of awe, some sense in the deep green Of life-joy never to return; Miles east, dark rain-clouds haunt the dayâ Miles west, the sea lies cold and grey: And overhead, suspending flight, A goshawk hangs in the drear light. VI. THE WINDMILL. (Gathering storm.) Four huge black arms against the skyâ Still now, and waiting for the wind; No clouds in the blue night behind, But faint far storm-mists trailed on high, And in the east a shadow black With fringes split like wild sea-wrack: It moans, and surely moves at last In travail with the rising blast. VII. SEA-WRACK. Across the grey sea-hollowed rocks The waves with sleepy motion glide, And in the long wash of the tide The sea-wrack's brown and tangled locks Sway gently as though nevermore Wild blasts should rage upon the shore: And now and then between the slim Long locks the silver fishes swim. VIII. THE BLUE HERON. (Solitude.) Here sheer into the emerald lake On either side the hills slope down, In the long darkness of whose frown Rarely the young lambs dare to make Their bleating cries; no sound is heard Of even any wandering bird: But standing on a great grey stone A grey-blue heron broods alone. IX. SHELLS ON THE SEA-SHORE. A yellow stretch of rippled sand Curved by the bay to two gold lips; Ah look! the blue sea slyly slips Faint frothing up the shingly strandâ Just takes the kiss, and then for fear Reflows, but ebbs to reappear. The sea-shells strewn around sing low The secret sea-things that they know. X. THE NIGHTINGALE. The curving elm-boles meeting make An archway, where the sun at morn And, after dusk, the moon's white horn Seem framed 'mid dark green leaves that shake In little vagrant puffs of wind Faint wandering in the wood behind: Moonlight and darkness nowâO hear! The jug-jug-jug divinely clear! XI. THE SWOLLEN RIVER. Between the lush low-lying banks The swollen river, dark and deep, Hath something dreadful in its sweep: Just here, in melancholy ranks, The shaking poplars stand and know Some dim presentiment of woe. O'erhanging weeds defy the wave, Roses and lilies find a grave. XII. MOONLIGHT AT SEA. Far eastwards broods a darkness black, As black a shadow on the west; But sleeping on the heaving breast Of midway ocean lies a track Of glittering, shining, silver light, A zone miraculously bright: Hung as a lamp before God's ways The moon fills mid-space with her blaze. XIII. A DEAD CALM AND MIST. (Towards evening.) The slow heave of the sleeping sea With pulse-like motion swells and falls, And drowsily a stray gull calls The very wail of melancholy; All day the moveless mist has slept On the same bosom east winds swept: No breath of change in the grey mist, Save just a dream of amethyst. XIV. LABOURERS RETURNING HOME. Across the turnip-fields green-grey And ploughed up pastures, furrowed brown, Now that the hot fierce sun is down The weary labourers seek their wayâ Down the rough road with sun-baked ruts To yonder dismal straggling huts. In this soft afterglow each leaf Seems quivering with some sense of grief. XV. A GREEN WAVE. Between the salt sea-send before And all the flowing gulphs behind, Half lifted by the rising wind, Half eager for the ungain'd shore, A great green wave of shining light Sweeps onward crowned with dazzling white: Above, the east wind shreds the sky With plumes from the grey clouds that fly. XVI. MORNING GLORY. Amber and gold and amethyst, And carmine shot with crimson through, And, quivering in the tender blue, The fires of Phosphor o'er a mist Of wild-rose pinkâand overhead The immaculate azure far outspread. The unsubstantial hills loom fair In delicate shadows thro' the air. XVII. DAWN AMID SCOTCH FIRS. The furtive lights that herald dawn Are shimmering 'mid the steel-blue firs; A slow awakening wind half stirs And the long branches breathes upon; The east grows clearerâclearerâlo, The day is born! A refluent flow Of silver waves along each tree For one brief moment dazzlingly. XVIII. GROUND-LIGHTNING. The mountain-range in purple looms From out the twilight-haunted west; Star-crown'd, far east, Schehallion's crest O'ertops the night; here, where there booms The bittern's hollow voicing harsh, Gleam blue, green, yellow o'er the marsh Strange furtive lights: the ghosts they seem Of lightnings that shall no more stream. XIX. THE EBBING TIDE. A long low gurgle down the strand, The sputtering of the drying wrack! The tide is slowly ebbing back With listless murmuring from the land, And the small waves reluctant flow Where the broad-bosomed currents go. The sea has fall'n asleep, and lies Dense blue beneath the dense blue skies. XX. THE INCOMING TIDE. Grey-glimmering thro' the dusky air The spectral cliffs loom o'er the sea, And up the strand tumultuously The windy tidal billows tear: How stern yon rockânay, look once more, The heedless waves above it pour! Borne inwards o'er the spray-swept land In thunder booms the sea's command. XXI. TWO OLD YEWS. Here 'neath the shade of cloisters vast Two immemorial yew-trees stand, Like pilgrims from an ancient land: Long long ago in the dim past They saw the mystic Druid rites Appease strange gods thro' bodeful nights. Their boughs dead centuries enfoldâ Deathless they seem, tho' scarred and old. XXII. PHOSPHORESCENT SEA. (I.) The sea scarce heaves in its calm sleep, The wind has not awakened yet Tho' in its dreams it seems to fret, For, ever and again, the deep Hearkens a sigh that steals along As might some echo of sad song: Ah, there the wind stirs! Lo, the dark Dim sea's on fire around our barque. XXIII. PHOSPHORESCENT SEA. (II.) As when the face of one thought dead Breaks into ghastly life again, The sea becomes a fiery plain Of flames, blue, yellow, green, and red; Each wave seems some drown'd mariner Upheaved from depths that no winds stir: Surely the sea has long since died, And now lies rotting, putrefied. A repetition of the metaphor in lines eleven and twelve of page 24, The Human Inheritance. XXIV. PHOSPHORESCENT SEA. (III.) How beautiful! the violet waves Break upon orange-coloured seas; And at each impulse of the breeze A green and crimson ocean laves The ship's black sides: as wild and strange As those swift lights that burn and change In glory ere the Polar morn Dawns on the frozen wastes forlorn. XXV. MOUNTAIN MISTS. As though the bleak and lonely hill Were some drear desolate mount in hell Where spirits by some potent spell Were forced to circleâdamp and chill The grey wan mists trail hour by hour From crag to crag, and cling and cower. From where the rain-cloud shrouds the peak An eagle flings at times a shriek. XXVI. MOONRISE. (August.) The wheat lies close in cluster'd gold Pale as the ore of Austral mines, For just above the tree-tops shines The moon, full-orb'd: within the fold The drowsy sheep seem fleeced with snow, And branches, swaying to and fro In the faint wind, in radiance gleam, Each turn'd to silver by some beam. XXVII. MOONRISE. (November.) The phenomenal aspects of the moon described in these and the succeeding lines were observed by the writer during a winter stay of some six or eight weeks amongst the mountain districts of Dumfries-shire. The first snows of the year lie white Upon the branches bending low; A surging wind the flakes doth blow Before the coming feet of Nightâ Half dusk, half day, betwixt the pines Green-yellow the full moon reclines: Green-yellow, and now wholly green, While faint the windy stars are seen. XXVIII. MOONRISE. (December.) The snow-clad fields are flushed with red, As though the sun's last dying rays Ensanguin'd them with crimson blazeâ For lo, in the wan skies o'erhead The moon hangs as though dipped in blood: And almost the stream's frozen flood Seems like a wound that has just bled Till now the earth lies cold and dead. XXIX.âPINES IN STORM. Hark! like a wild and furious sea Where the bleak send and driving spray Harrow the dying face of day A sound swells up tumultuously! Amongst the pines the tempest dwells, And swells and moans, and moans and swells. Each pine, like some sad spirit, cries Stricken and weary 'neath drear skies. XXX.âTHE LONELY LARCH. Two cliffs stupendous frown upon The sunless pass far down belowâ Far down the hawks dart to and fro Like flies within the twilight wan; And here, in the sun's sinking blaze, A lonely windy larch-tree sways: Sole living thing at this great height It is the wind's sport day and night. THE TIDES OF VENICE. With a soft slow gentle motion Swings the slow tide from the sea, Swings the slow tide hushfully From the distant restless ocean, Through the sinuous canals, Past the ancient wave-worn walls That have seen the galleys sweep With great captains of the deep, Fresh from where the Moslem calls The Muezzin from the steep Temple-domes that face the sea. With a slow and gentle motion, Like low breathing, ceaselessly The tide steals from the ocean, As a cloud that thro' the sky Ever draweth, draweth nigh, Though its white wings seem to beat No wind that blows at all, But lie folded calm and sweet By its soft immaculate sideâ So moves the sleeping tide Past bridge and palace wall. And hung in purple heaven God's footstool, fill'd with light And wheel'd by spirits seven, Seems the clear soul of night, So pure, so soft, so brightâ The very soul it seems Of Venice of the deep Lying hush'd and still in sleep 'Neath the glory of her beams, Dreaming, dreaming ancient dreams. And like silver fires aglow The panting planets shine And search the waters far below, The waters that with stilly flow Come and go Beyond the salt sea line. A faint wind is playing With the small sea-waves Above the myriad graves O'er which move swaying, swaying The long green tangled reeds And grasses of the sea, And softly stir the slimy weeds That cling to where the salt sea laves The stairs of palaces that be No longer great or free. At times, the shadows leaving, Black shapes leap forth and glide Like great fish on the tideâ And singing side by side The gondolieri, cleaving With lithe and rhythmic oar The waters slowly heaving, Chant their old sea-born lore, The old monotonous song The tides have swept for long Round the Adriatic shore. The very soul of mystery Seems brooding here alone: Each bridge and pier and stone Holds secrets of the sea; The slow tide hushfully Moves with a scarce heard moan And soft caressing motion, For their past to it is known, To it and the silent ocean. Hark! from you window singing, Slowly, gently, singing, A woman with a perfect face Dreams out into the night, Her low voice, bird-like winging Faint o'er the watery ways; Fashion'd with flawless grace, Haloed with tender light, She seems some angel pure and bright. The sweet voice swelleth slowly With music rich and deep; Sweeter than when in sleep The soul with earth-closed eyes In a vision holy Hears the strains of Paradise: And gaining volume still doth rise Till all the wild notes sweep In full majestic song The dim canals along, And like a fading memory then dies. I know that voice! 'Tis hers who came To Venice with a singer's fame, A voice God gave her as a sign He gives sometimes what is divine, A face for Dolorous Mary's shrine, All loveliness the tongue can name, A mind impervious to shame And spirit of a concubine. The gondolieri, as they pass Her palace, mark it with a laugh: The gamesters turn and quaff Their wine to her whose heart of dust Claims kinship with their own coarse lust. So fair, so seeming holy, As wrapt in some pure dream Where heaven more near doth seem, While the salt tides ebb, ebb slowly With murmurs melancholy, O harlot! is thy breath But some sweet mask of death? If this thy last great song should be What shall come unto thee Poor wreckage of life's sea! O Venice, art thou such an one, Thou who hast been Crown'd as a queen Amidst the nations! Hast thou won The saffron robes that mark thee lost, Thou whom the blue waves tossed Around, when all thy flags unfurl'd Waved defiance to the world; Whom the fierce Turk strove in vain To vanquish; who hast hurl'd Thine omnipotence against the might of Spain, Thou nursling of the wind And playmate of the seaâ O! is the loveliness we find Still clinging unto thee A bitter mockery? Art thou too dead and lonely, Like her who ruled of old,â Tyre, crown'd with ancient gold? Or, art thou sleeping only To wake some distant day, To shake thy sea-blown hair again, To snap thy rusted chain, To see the world behold The glory of thy sway? O city of the sea Laved by the salt sea-tides That daily ebb and flow With long wash ceaselessly Around thy wave-worn sides, Thou art as she who sang With angel voice and heart of dust! Thou too art cast aside of men, Thy war-cries long since rang Their last fierce clang, Thou also art the sport of lust. As mighty Tyre was, when Her glory was a thing To jeer at, and the owlet's wing Haunted her palace walls, So shalt thou, Venice, be When all thy great canals, What all thy lords possess And thine own loveliness Are levelled with the sea. Slow, with a steadfast motion, The salt tides ebb away, Sweep hushfully away Towards the silent ocean: Ere long the sea-line grey Far east will shake with gold, And Venice, weary and old, Will see another day Make all her beauty fair In the blue enfolding air. Meanwhile past bridge and palace, Past each carv'd wave-worn stone, With low incessant moan The tide flows forth alone Its burdens to efface, To whisper the disgrace And all the shame and woe To the sea where it doth flow. O tides of life that wander Led by some unseen hand About our mortal strand, As the salt sea-tides yonder Ye, in your ebb and flow, Gather our joy and woe; And in your swift retreating Surge joy and exaltation, The wails of desolation, Great hopes in strong hearts beating Tears, laughter, prayers, and pain: But ever back again These come with ceaseless iteration. O that your floods could bear To some unmeasured sea The long dull agony, Grief, sorrow, anguish, care, That fill men evermore, Far from our human shore; And bearing so could bring When in your earthward flow Instead of further woe To each some fair sweet thingâ Some hope fulfill'd, some new desire, Some rest for weary feet, A spark of the immortal fire Wherewith mankind can still aspire To something nobler, grander, higher, Some joy sad eyes to meet, Some message sweet. Hush! with what gentle swaying The twilight waters go As seaward still they flow; A new-born wind is playing And singing weird strange runes Out on the grey lagunes; And tolling to and fro, With a music sad and slow, A convent bell is ringing O'er the cowled monks bent and singingâ Through the sinuous canals, Past the ancient wave-worn walls With a soft slow gentle motion Swings the ebb-tide to the sea, Swings the slow tide hushfully To the distant restless ocean. A DIALOGUE. Nature. Lo here, in this calm sea where no waves whirl, I make some thought renascent in this pearlâ Must it remain and know no nobler sphere Than twilight waters ever calm and clear? God. Deep in calm seas quiescent let it lie: Its pure perfection none shall e'er descry Save the omniscient omnipresent eye That loves the secrets of the earth and sky. Nature. Beneath this vast and craggy peak there dwells Long lullabied by subterranean wells Of icy waters dark as darkest night, A gem of wonderful translucent light: Shall it remain unguessed, unsought, alone, A living heart in this eternal stone? God. Nay, let some miner in the mountain's womb Come on this ruby gleaming thro' the gloom: Its place sufficeth not, it hath no room To send forth rays, it seeks a nobler doomâ Yea, let it go, and feel a woman's breath, And be the bale-star of a shattered faith And lead a dying nation to its death. Nature. Lo, on strewn palm-leaves in this unknown isle A new-born babe upon the world doth smile: The mystic essence shines from out his eyes, Pure as the angels without spot or guileâ Shall its soul now, while pure, regain the skies? God. Nay, let it know the wild free joyous bliss Of morn and eve, of heedless winds that kiss The dewy lips of flowers while still they sleep, Of singing birds, and beasts that run and leap,â Let him live out his life without a thought, A perfect animal, the soul forgot, Until the cycle of his years doth creep Closer and wrap both body and soul in sleep. Nature. Behold, within yon far off teeming town A woman thanks thee for her life's chief crown, A child is hers, whom all fair hopes surround: Shall he not live and make his age resound With wisdom long sought after, seldom found? God. Let his unswathÃ©d soul come forth to me, A spirit upon earth it shall not be. I call for one to come and one to stay; For this to shine far from the light of day, And this to dazzle eyes of men away; One shall return again to primal force, Another shall attain an infinite courseâ Yet all are as the same to me who know The ultimate ebb of things and the first flow. DESOLATION. I come from dark and tempest From lands that know no peace, From mansions where no stray guest Of travail hath surcease, Where grey wan skies of morning Slow fade to greyer eve, And echoing winds of scorning Subside in sobs that grieve. I stand alone and lonely, And watch each dark day die; Night breaks again and only More desolate grows the sky: And while my heart grows faint then With all its weary lot The phantom shades of dead men (To me dead) know me not. I see the long years creeping That have not come to me, The days thereof all weeping With sad eyes bitterly, And oh I know each morrow That thrills with anguish low Hath a deeper sense of sorrow, Is crown'd with weightier woe. CHRISTMAS-EVE. One eve, when the cold snow lay white Along the silent street, A little child, all clothed in light And with a smile most sweet, Did enter my dim lonely room As chimed the midnight bell:â âI am thy Life, thy Death, thy Doom, For thee I entered Hell!â âO little child,â I said, âart thou Some messenger divine?â He pointed to his tender brow Round which soft light did shine, And there I saw a shadowy crown, Of plaited thorns 'twas wrought, And from each thorn there trickled down A liquid crimson spot. And while I looked he faded slow And vanish'd from my sight: Only the gusty wind did blow The wild snow through the night. And when in after-dreams I lay I heard the white hosts cry âHosanna! on this day The Christ comes from on high!â LIFE. âO sweet, sweet, sweet Is life,â a bird sang loud; And underneath a crowd Listened with weary wayworn feet. âHow sweet, O sweet, sweet, sweet!â âO sad, sad, sad Is life,â a bird thrilled loud; And underneath, a crowd Moaned also, with torn bleeding feet, âHow sad, O sad, sad, sad!â SIGHT. I looked in the eyes of a brute, I looked on the face of a man, A blossom, a flower, a fruit, An insect, all links of a plan: I gazed thro' the depths of the sea, On clouds, and on mountains afar; And I saw the chain twine around me And reach to the farthest star. YOUNG LOVE. On a flower in a forest, A lily-bosom'd flower, (Where never windy tempest Came, nor ever any shower)â A golden hour of birthtide, (The sky was blue, so blue!) Left me lying 'mid a songtide Of birds of every hue. Upon the white flower swaying I laughed and sang in glee, Till the thrushes long delaying Sang back deliciously; And the dear white cloudlets sleeping Up in the blue, blue sky, Seem'd downy cherubs peeping Between the pine boughs high. A little wind came blowing And sang a wild-wood song, It whispered of the flowing Of bubbling streams along; I laughed, and stood, and rising Found I had two small wingsâ So then I flew rejoicing Towards the water-springs. And ever 'mid my flying, (A little cloud I seem'd!) I heard a great deep sighing, As earth in trouble dream'd; And when I reached the river The sound more windlike blew:â The glad stream lisped âfor ever,ââ But the sighing grew and grew. And as I laughed and wonder'd Among the flow'rs and grass, All suddenly it thunder'd, The sunlight seem'd to pass: A great wind took and blew me Across a grey wet sand, And tho' I wept it threw me Far from the joyous land. And now the salt waves leaping Pursue with hungry springs, And baffled, blind, and weeping, I beat my draggled wings: This was the great deep sighing I heard when I was youngâ And now, wind-weary, dying, My last sob-note is sung! DREAM LAND. Softly, hushfully, Silently flow Dim streams of sweetness Thro' lands of woe; Hushfully, hushfully Wash the cool waves Thro' intricate spaces Of sea-worn caves; And silently, suddenly Gather wan faces Long laid in graves. Speechless, and yearning O with sad eyes! And wan hearts burning With memories: Silently, silently, Gath'ring around From cool dark places Of churchyard ground: O the wan faces Whose lips have no sound. Hushfully, hushfully, Strange rivers flow Thro' silent lands No soul doth know; Peacefully, peacefully, Restful and slow, Faint music of wings On the tired wind doth go: Hushfully, hushfully, Hushfully so, Whether with pleasure Or woe. A GREETING (TO E. L. H.) The month, in whose warm heart is graven deep The cuckoo's farewell voice, waits behind May, Her frolic sister, who upon the way Strews blossoms laughing: from their long dark sleep Daily the blessÃ©d roses stir and creep From fold and bud: and thro' the twilight grey That dreams about the haunts of vanish'd day The culver calleth from the wooded steep. I, in the busy haunts of men, but dream Of these, as thou upon thy weary bed: Yet every day we know the blue skies gleam And ev'ry night the star-lamps shine, o'erheadâ Is it not well with us that we can feel At least such memoried raptures o'er us steal? REVELATION. Lo, in that shadowy place wherein is found The pale unreal fruit which men call dreams, I wander'd. Ever underneath wan gleams Of misty moonlight faintly shining roundâ Long resting on the silent trees as sound Before awakening, and o'er sedgy streams Moving like wind in broad and quivering beamsâ A spirit walked beside me. From a mound, Rustling with poplar leaves from top to base, Some bird I knew not shrilled a cry of dole, So bitter, I cried out to God for grace: Then spake that one, While onward thy years roll Thou shalt be haunted by this hated faceâ And looking up I looked on mine own soul. POSSIBILITIES. As day doth live beyond the sunset skies So life may wait us at the silent grave: Not windless is the sea because there rave Not always the great storm-wind's harmonies. There may be light too strong for earthly eyes; There may be hands to succour and to save From Death's indifferent o'erwhelming wave; Nay, Death may lift to some divine surprise! There may be music beyond instruments, And Spring for ev'ry frost-nipt shapeless clod, There may be mightier love sacraments Than e'er were seen on consecrated sod; A man there may be with Christ's lineaments, And mid the wheels of Fate a living God! PAIN. I am God's eldest:âI and Love are twin; We look for ever in the other's face; Together our flight wings throughout all spaceâ Sun, Star, Man, God, alike we dwell therein; Some far-off goal together strive to win. But here on earth I leave the mightier trace, Clasp hands more close with all the human race, And weave the shadow-webs of joy and sin. And most I dwell in the clear skies at dawn, In marvellous eves when all the stars are bright, In music e'er the sweetest chord is gone, In woman's beauty still unsoiled and white, In children's slumber in the morning wan, And lover's vows and yearnings in the night. BEN-A-CHAOLAIS (The Mountain of Sounds). One of the Paps of Jura overlooking the Atlantic. It is honeycombed in its seaward front with hollow narrow caverns running often far inland, where strange currents of air and echoing tidal billows are ever moving: hence, both in calm and tempest, strange wailing sounds seem to issue from its depths. The wild Atlantic blasts whirl day and night Their rheum upon it, and the mountain stands Frowning immoveably, as a giant with bands Chained to the ground beholds the insulting light. Hark! are they sea-mews in their wailing flight These dismal echoes moaning o'er the sands? Or swell the cries from weird unearthly lands Borne hence upon the wild wind's wings of might? Thou art the image of a human soul, O lonely hill, fronting the blasts of fateâ Like thee for ever haunted by wild cries From secret depths, and heedless of the roll Of whirling seas with deathful strength elate, Or the long desolate darkness of the skies. SPRING-WIND. Reprinted from Mr. T. Hall Caine's Sonnets of Three Centuries. (Elliot Stock. 1882.) O full-voiced herald of immaculate Spring, With clarion gladness striking every tree To answering raptures, as a resonant sea Fills rock-bound shores with thunders echoingâ O thou, each beat of whose tempestuous wing Shakes the long winter-sleep from hill and lea, And rouses with loud reckless jubilant glee The birds that have not dared as yet to sing: O wind, that comest with prophetic cries, Hast thou indeed beheld the face that is The joy of poets and the glory of birdsâ Spring's face itself: hast thou 'neath bluer skies Met the warm lips that are the gates of bliss, And heard June's leaf-like murmur of sweet words? TO THE SPIRIT CALLED LAUDANUM. Calmer of pain that would be agony, O spirit, who with hands benign doth keep The tired soul shrouded in a veil of sleep,â Who silently takes up the last faint sigh As angels souls of children when they dieâ Whose breath is as those waves upon the deep Born in a tempest but who softly creep Towards windless calms where motionless they lie. I feel the silence brooding from thy gaze, I see the shadow of thy slumberous wing Shroud the slow ebb of pain's reluctant tideâ O spirit, whose feet haunt the silent ways Of sleep and death where voices never ring, I hear the sea where all tired waves subside. LINES. These lines, and those following, entitled The Redeemer, must not be judged as hexametrical efforts. They were portion of a series written similarly irregularly, when the author held rather heretical views on the limitations of the sonnet and on verse-structure generally. They are inserted simply for the truth that, to the writer, is set forth in each. Fair in my sight as white lilies that shine in the sunrise: Sweeter than flow'rs in the meadows that scent the mornings of spring: Dearer than vision of truth, for thou art the truth revealÃ©d, Dearer than faith, for thou art the crown of aspiration, Dearer than hope, for of hope thou art the fulfilment! O love, love, love, thou hast turned the darkness of the world Into ineffable light, and all its intricate ways To straight, clear paths that lead from the depths to the heavens. The flower of my soul sways high in the wind of thy love, Glowing with passionate fervour through fulness of joy; Soul with soul are we wedded, beyond the decay of the body, And spirit hath spirit touched, beyond the confines of flesh: Desire with mighty wings hath swept the chords of our being, And flesh and spirit are one in the mystic union of love! THE REDEEMER. I know that my Redeemer livethâbut out of the depths of time He hath not called to me yet. But from th' immeasurable tracts That widen unending to where beginneth eternity Falleth at times a voice, heart-thrilling, soul-piercing, life-giving; High sometimes and clear, as a lark singing in a holy dawn, Hush'd and afar off again as a dreaming wave upon seas Lit by a low vast moon, and windlessly sleeping, but ever Sweet with a human love, and full of ineffable yearning, And crying of soul unto soul from infinite deep unto deep. And sometimes I look and gaze out upon uttermost darkness And hear the wail of desolate winds moaning around the worldâ Till the darkness shivers to light, and clashing thro' earth and heaven I hear great wings make music, and marvellous thunderous songs Shout âThy Redeemer liveth, O human soul, and crieth for thee!â LAST WORDS. (To the one who has always first read everything I have written.) How can I tell thee, dear, what never words Have fitly told? How ope my heart to thee Wherein thou might'st, as in a well, perceive Deep down but the mere shadow of my love? But as the wind sweeps from the icy north To some lov'd isle in dim Pacific seas, Or as the never-ceasing circling waves Follow round earth the radiant orb of night, So follow I with love unspeakable The pathways fill'd with light which are thine own. O love, thou art the flame that burns for me, My steady purpose! That no dark can quench! Holding thy hand I fear no more to watch The shifting of the changeful lights of Fate.</field>
