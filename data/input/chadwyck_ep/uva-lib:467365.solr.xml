      <field name="fulltext">SONGS OF THE GAEL THE MELODY OF THE HARP Oh! Harp of Erin, what glamour gay, What dark despairing are in thy lay! What true love slighted thy sorrow swells, What proud hearts plighted thy rapture tell. Round thy dim form lamenting swarm What Banshees dread! till, glowing warm, A heavenly iris of hope upsprings From out the tumult that shakes thy strings. The chief dejected with drooping brow, Aroused, erected, is hearkening now, The while abhorrent of shame and fear Thy tuneful torrent invades his ear. He calls his clan: “Who will and can— Your chieftain follow in Valour's van!” Then forward thunder the gallant Gael And death and plunder are o'er the Pale. The child is calling through fever dreams; When, softly falling as faery streams, Thy magic Soontree his soul shall sweep Into the country of blessed sleep. To ears that heed not their longing moan Let lovers plead not with words alone, But seek thine aid. The haughtiest maid Will pause by thy sweet influence swayed; Until the ditty so poignant proves, She melts to pity and melting loves. SONGS OF SUMMER AND WINTER (From the early Irish) THE FIRST WINTER SONG Take my tidings! Stags contend; Snows descend— Summer's end! A chill wind raging; The sun low keeping, Swift to set O'er seas high sweeping. Dull red the fern; Shapes are shadows; Wild geese mourn O'er misty meadows. Keen cold limes each weaker wing. Icy times— Such I sing! Take my tidings! THE FIRST SUMMER SONG Beltane! the Season's star! Enchanting then the colours are; Blackbirds flute a full lay, Be there but a dart of day. The loud cuckoo, of dusky hue, Cries, “Hail! splendid hour!” He's gone, the churl of surly brow, Every bough is now a bower! Summer calls; the river falls; The swift wild steed to the pool is gone; The heath outspreads her tresses bright; Soft and white is the cannavaun. Tremors take the heart of the deer; Smooth and clear runs the tide; Season when the ocean sleeps, And blossom creeps the earth to hide. Bees with puny strength upbear Through the air their burden sweet; Cows, mire-footed, mount the hill, Ants their fill of honey eat. Forest harps music sound; The sail gathers! Peace profound! Hue on hue the mountain takes, In misty blue melt the lakes. A strenuous bard, the corncrake calls; The virgin falls fill their urns, To the panting pool descanting Till the rushes' talk returns. Light aloft dart the swallows! Melody follows the green hill's round; The soft rich mast is burgeoning fast, The frogs in chorus croak around. Dark is the peat as the raven's coat, The cuckoo's note bids welcome wide— The speckled trout from the stream leaps out; Long and strong is the warrior's stride. Man flourishes; in fair young pride At his side the maiden buds— Perfect each plain, majestic, mute— From crown to root perfect each wood. The sunny splendour how delightful! Winter frightful far is fled. With flower each orchard now is white full, Such joyous peace has summer shed! Amid the meadows, among bright petals, Softly settles a flight of stares; Richly around the green field rustles, Through and through it a white stream fares. Wild longing is on you for racing horses, The level courses the ranked lines hold, And such bright shafts through the blue air shiver Each flag in the river is flashing gold. A little importunate one upspringing Shrills and shrills his tremulous lay! The lark it is, clear tidings singing Of May of the colours, enchanting May! THE SECOND WINTER SONG Cold, cold until Doom! The storm goes gathering gloom; Each flashing furrow a stream; A full lake every ford in the coom. Sea large are the scowling lakes, Thin sleet-spears swell to an host, Light rains clash as shields on the coast; Like a white wether's fleece fall the flakes. The roadside pools are as ponds, Each moor like a forest uplifts, No shelter the bird-flock finds, Breech high the stark snow drifts. Swift frost has the ways in his hold, Keen the strife around Colt's standing stone, And the tempest so stretches her fold That none can cry aught but “cold”! THE SECOND SUMMER SONG Summer's here! free, balm-blowing; Down the brown wood verdure's glowing; Slim, nimble deer are leaping; Smooth the path of seals is showing. Cuckoos, echoing to each other, Soothe to blest, restful slumber; Gentle birds glance on the hill-side, And swift grey stags in number. Restless run the deer—behind them Pours the curled pack, tuneful baying; From end to end laughs the strand, Where the excited sea is spraying. By the playful breezes stirred Drum Dail's oak tops dimly welter; While the noble, hornless herd Seek in Cuan wood a shelter. Every herb begins to sprout; The oakwood heights with green abound; Summer's in, winter's out! Twisted hollies wound the hound. Loud the blackbird pipes his lay, The live wood's heir from May to May; The excited sea is lulled to sleep, In air the speckled salmon leap. The sun is laughing over the land, To the brood of cares the back of my hand! Hounds bark, tryst the deer, Ravens flourish, summer's here! SONGS OF THE SIDHE THE KING'S CAVE Rash Son, return! Yon shores that dazzle With glowing pleasaunce, glittering plain, And crystal keep is not Hy-Brazil, But some false phantom of the main. And yon bright band thy vision meeting, Their warbled welcome hither fleeting— Oh, trust not to their siren greeting, Oh, wave not, wave not back again! But veil thine eyes from their entreating, And list not their enchanting strain! My Sovran Sire, no cruel vision Compels my curragh o'er the deep! Yea, have we seen the land Elysian, Hy-Brazil, out of Ocean leap. None ever knew it smiling nearer, Or hearkened yet, a blessed hearer, Its Virgin Chorus chanting clearer O'er lulled Atlantic's cradled sleep. That strain again! What psalm sincerer From Angel harps to Earth could sweep. With hand to brow the Monarch hoary Stood rapt upon the Western ray, Till in a gulf of golden glory The bright bark melted o'er the bay. Then cracked the glass of calm asunder! Then roared the cave the sea cliff under! Then sprang to shore, with hoofs of thunder, Mannanan's steeds of ghostly grey. Yet ere the shock, a cry of wonder, “Hy-Brazil here!” rose far away. MORE OF CLOYNE Little sister, whom the Fay Hides away within his doon, Deep below yon tufted fern, Oh, list and learn my magic tune. Long ago, when snared like thee By the Shee, my harp and I O'er them wove the slumber spell, Warbling well its lullaby. Till with dreamy smiles they sank, Rank on rank, before the strain; Then I rose from out the rath And found my path to earth again. Little sister, to my woe Hid below among the Shee, List and learn my magic tune, That it full soon may succour thee. THE SONG OF THE FAIRY KING Bright Queen of Women, oh, come away! Oh, come to my kingdom strange to see: Where tresses flow with a golden glow, And white as snow is the fair body. Beneath the silky curtains of arching ebon brows, Soft eyes of sunny azure the heart enthral, A speech of magic songs to each rosy mouth belongs, And sorrowful sighing can ne'er befall. Oh, bright are the blooms of thine own Innisfail, And green is her garland around the West; But brighter flowers and greener bowers Shall all be ours in that country blest. Or can her streams compare to the runnels rich and rare Of slow yellow honey and swift red wine, That softly slip to the longing lip With magic flow through that land of mine? We roam the earth in its grief and mirth, But move unseen of all therein; For before their gaze there hangs the haze, The heavy haze of their mortal sin. But, oh! our age it wastes not; since our beauty tastes not Of Evil's tempting apple and droops and dies. Cold death shall slay us never but for ever and for ever Love's stainless ardours shall illume our eyes. Then, Queen of Women, oh, come away! Far, far away to my fairy throne, To my realm of rest in the magic West, Where sin and sorrow are all unknown. THE SONG OF NIAMH OF THE GOLDEN TRESSES Down in the shades of Lene dark bowering Hunting red deer through the glades gold flowering; Oh, Finn! oh, Oscur, our glee! When on a palfrey milk-white, a whiter one, Shapely and slight, ah, no shapelier, slighter one, Waved her sceptre star bright, the far brighter one— Waved, waved in suppliant plea. “Niamh am I of the locks gold glittering”— O, at her cry the birds ceased twittering— “Sole Child of The King of Youth. Oiseen's dark eyes in dreams have haunted me, Oiseen's song streams all day have daunted me! I, who scatheless of Love long have vaunted me, Ah! now know his searching truth.” “Oscur and Finn, this long farewell from me! Nought now can win this strong, sweet spell from me! Ochone, ochone, ollalu!” Panting with love to make my dear bride of her, Murmuring dove, I leaped to the side of her! Forth, forth our white palfrey flew. On through the tangled and tost cloud armament Into star-spangled deeps of the firmament; While sweet rang Niamh's lay, “Come, O Oiseen, where sorrow shadeth not, Scorn is unseen, and anger upbraideth not; Come with thy Queen where beauty fadeth not, Where Youth and Love are for aye!” THE MAGIC MIST Dread Bard out of Desmond deep-valleyed, Whence comest thou chanting to-night, From thy brow to thy bosom death pallid, Thine eyes like a seer's star-bright? And whence, o'er thy guest seat allotted, These strange, sudden eddies of air, And why is the quickan flower clotted Like foam in the flow of thy hair? “To and fro in high thought on the mountains I strode in my singing-robe green, Where Mangerton, father of fountains, Starts sternly from lovely Loch Lene; When around me and under and o'er me Rang melody none may resist; For rapture I swooned, while before me Earth faded in magical mist. “And there my dull body sank sleeping 'Neath quickans of quivering sway, My soul in her song robe went sweeping Where Cleena holds court o'er the fay— The land where all tears are with smiling, The land where all smiles are with tears, Where years shrink to days of beguiling, Days yearn into long, blessed years.” “Arch minstrel of Desmond, we dread thee, Lest, lifted to-night in our hall, The spell of lone music that led thee To Faery, have fettered us all.” “Nay, fear not! though Cleena be calling, I only her clairseach obey. To earth the earth body is falling, The soul soars exultant away.” SONGS OF HEROES CUCHULLIN AND EMER Cuchullin Come down, fair Emer, from out thy prison, Emer, my love, come down to me; For the radiant moon at last has risen That shall light us safe to the rolling sea. Emer Who is the hero, half-beholden In the beechen shadow beneath my bower, Of mien majestic and tresses golden, Singing thus in the still night hour? Cuchullin It is I, Cuchullin, thy faithful lover, Come from afar to set thee free; It is I that stand in the beechen cover, Sending my heart in song to thee. Emer Of my father stern, alas! I fear me, Of my brothers brave and my kinsfolk all; Ere thy mighty hands afar can bear me, I must pass through their bright-lit banquet hall. Cuchullin Fear not thy kinsmen's hostile number, Thy brothers brave and thy haughty sire; Through the banquet hall they are stretched in slumber, Quenched are the torches, dead the fire. Emer I fear for the fosse so deep and sullen, And the watch-dogs fierce that bay on its brim; Not for myself I fear, Cuchullin, But lest they should rend thee limb from limb. Cuchullin Thy father's hounds are my old companions, They will fawn at my feet till, as eagles float Out from the rock with their young on their pinions, With thee at my bosom I leap the moat. Emer Every Sept is our kinship boasting Over Bregia north to Dun-Lir; They will follow at dawn with such a hosting, Alas! alas! for thy life I fear. Cuchullin See! how my war-car bounds in the shadows, Light as a golden boat on the bay! Lo! my good steeds! that athwart the meadows Tempest-footed shall whirl us away. Emer Good-bye! for ever my father, my father, For a loving heart to me you bore. Good-bye, fair Lusk, I shall never gather Thy sweet wild blossoms and berries more. Good-bye for ever, fortress of power, And the lawn, and the beeches, I loved so well! Good-bye for ever, my maiden bower, Where Love first laid me under his spell! My father—a bitter wrong I do him; But thus, even thus, his power is past. As the sea draws the little Tolka to him, Thou hast drawn me, Cuchullin, to thee at last. Like a god to his earthly mistress bending Thou hast stooped for thy bride from the hills above. I would die, Cuchullin, thy life defending, And, oh, let me die if I lose thy love! EMER'S FAREWELL TO CUCHULLIN O might a maid confess her secret longing To one who dearly loves but may not speak! Alas! I had not hidden to thy wronging A bleeding heart beneath a smiling cheek; I had not stemmed my bitter tears from starting, And thou hadst learned my bosom's dear distress, And half the pain, the cruel pain of parting, Had passed, Cuchullin, in thy fond caress. But go! Connacia's hostile trumpets call thee, Thy chariot mount and ride the ridge of war, And prove whatever feat of arms befall thee, The hope and pride of Emer of Lismore; Ah, then return, my hero, girt with glory, To knit my virgin heart so near to thine, That all who seek thy name in Erin's story Shall find its loving letters linked with mine. CUCHULLIN'S LAMENT OVER FERDIAH Oh, mightiest of the host of Maev, Ferdiah, sweetest mouth of song, Heroic arm most swift and strong To slaughter or to save. Oh, curls, oh, softly rustling wreath Of yellow curls that round him rolled, One beauteous belt of glistering gold— Who laid you low in death? Blue eyes that beamed with friendship bright Upon me through the battle press, Or o'er the mimic field of chess— Who quenched your kingly light? Alas, Ferdiah, overthrown By this red hand at last you fell! My bosom's brother, was it well? Ochone, ochone, ochone! AWAKE, AWAKE, FIANNA! Awake, awake, Fianna! For through the shadows, see, Great Oscur is hosting hither Beneath the red rowan tree. And as we march to meet him, The minstrels together raise On joyful harp and tympan The mighty Oscur's praise. For height and might of stature, A giant he stands rockfast, And yet his foot for fleetness Out-runneth the autumn blast. His eyes are earnest azure, His laughter a peal of pearls; The coolun round his shoulders A rain of ruddy curls. Behold, behold, his chariot Is bursting amid the foe! Oh, hark! his dread spear hurtles; Their leader in blood lies low. A bard of bards is Oscur, The moulder of mellow words, A minstrel true is Oscur Among the chiming chords. THE ROYAL HUNT Tantara rara, hark from Tara, how the herald's trumpet clear Gaily summons King and Commons to the hunting of the deer; And now the Ard Righ rides before us, circled by his shining court; Whilst the crowd's acclaiming chorus hails him to the happy sport, And tantara, tantara, tantara, tantara, hark the bugles' greeting Soft echoes, re-echoes, re-echoes, and echoes far into the distance retreating. Tantara rara, lirra lara! sweet the silver bugles blow, Dogs are doubting, footmen shouting hunt the covers high and low. Now uncouple Bran the supple, Bran and Scolan swift as flame! Loose us Laom, loose us Taom, free us ev'ry hound of fame! The stag is started in the hollow! Hark, the huntsman's view halloo! Hark, the hounds in chorus follow! Hulla hulla, hulla hoo! While tantara, tantara, fainter and fainter the horn is now replying, And further, and further, and further, and further—the hunt in the distance is dying. Tantara rara now from Tara over hill and dale we go, While we chevy, yoicks, tantivy, tally, tally, tallyho! ANCIENT LULLABY O sleep, my baby, you are sharing With the sun in rest repairing; While the moon her silver chair in Watches with your mother. Shoheen, sho lo! Lulla lo lo! The morning on a bed of roses, Evening on rude hills reposes: Dusk his heavy eyelid closes Under dreamy curtains. Shoheen, sho lo! Lulla lo lo! The winds lie lulled on bluest billows, Shining stars on cloudy pillows, Waters under nodding willows, Mists upon the mountains. Shoheen, sho lo! Lulla lo lo! Upon the fruits, upon the flowers, On the wood-birds in their bowers, On low huts and lofty towers Blessed sleep has fallen. Shoheen, sho lo! Lulla lo lo! And, ah! my child, as free from cumber, Thus thro' life could'st thou but slumber, Thus in death go join the number Of God's smiling angels. Shoheen, sho lo! Lulla lo lo! OISEEN'S LAMENT FOR OSCUR I sought my own son over Gowra's black field, Where the host of the Fians was shattered, Where fell all our mighty ones, and helmet and shield O'er the red earth lay shamefully scattered. I sought my own Oscur and my proud heart upleaped, As at last on a lone ridge I found him, His stern hand still clinging to the sword that had reaped Swathe on swathe of the dead foes around him. He held out his arms, though the drear mist of death Had begun o'er his bright eyes to gather. “I thank God,” he faltered with his failing breath, “That thou still art unhurt, oh, my father.” Then down, down I knelt by my heart's dearest one, All else beside him forgetting; Till Oscur's proud spirit passed forth like the sun In a red sea of glory setting. PATRICK AND OISEEN. Oiseen, Oiseen, too long is thy slumber. Oiseen, arise, and give ear to the chant; Thy force hath forsook thee, thy battles are over, And without us, old man, thou would'st perish of want. “My force hath forsook me, my battles are over; Since, alas! the famed empire of Finn is no more, And without you, indeed, 'tis for want I should perish, But, since Finn, sweetest music is music no more.” “Nay, foolish old man, for all of thy vaunting, Of the loud Dord-Finn chorus, the tympan and horn, Thou hast never heard music like matin bells ringing, Or solemn psalms sung in the still summer morn.” “Though greatly thou praisest the chants of the clerics, I had rather lie listening down in the dale To the voice of the cuckoo of Letterkee calling; Or the very sweet thrushes of green Glenn-a-Sgail; “Or the song of the blackbird of Derrycarn gushing So full and so free in the woods of the West (Oh, Patrick, no hymn under heaven could approach it! Ah, would that I only were under his nest!). “And I'd far liefer hearken the eagle's fierce whistle, From lone Glenamoo or the Ridge by the Stream, Or list the loud thunder of rushing Tra-Rury, Or catch on rough Irrus the sea-gull's scream. “And I'd bid long good-bye to the bells of the clerics, Could I once again follow o'er mountain and moor The tune of the twelve fleetest wolf hounds of Erin Let loose with their faces away from the Suir. “And Cnu, little Cnu of my bosom, where art thou? O small fairy dwarf to the Finians so dear, Whose harp ever soothed all our sorrows to slumber, Ah, Cnu, little Cnu, how I would you were here. “Where is now your betrothed one, oh, Cnu, where is Blathnaid? Who stood up in beauty to sing when you played; For the mouth of no mortal such sweetness could utter As the soft, rosy mouth of that magical maid.” SONGS OF GAEL AND GALL THE ALARM Hurry down, hurry down, hurry down ever, From the wrack-ridden mountain and yellow, rushing river! Stern horsemen and footmen with spear, axe and quiver, Oh, hurry down, hurry down, your land to deliver! Haste, oh, haste! for in cruel might clustering, Far and near the fierce Nordman is mustering; Haste, oh, haste! or the daughters ye cherish, The bride of your bosom shall far more than perish! Lo! how he toils down that narrow pass yonder, Ensnared by his spoils and oppressed by his plunder! Flash on him, crash on him, God's fire and thunder! And scatter and shatter his fell ranks asunder! Oh, smite the wolf, ere he slinks from the slaughter! Oh, rend the shark, ere he wins to deep water! Pursue and hew him to pieces by the haven, And feast with his red flesh the exulting sea raven! BATTLE HYMN Above the thunder crashes, Around the lightning flashes: Our heads are heaped with ashes! But Thou, God, art nigh! Thou launchest forth the levin, The storm by Thee is driven, Give heed, O Lord, from heaven, Hear, hear our cry. For, lo! the Dane defaces With fire Thy holy places, He hews Thy priests in pieces, Our maids more than die. Up, Lord, with storm and thunder, Pursue him with his plunder, And smite his ships in sunder, Lord God, Most High! THE RETURN FROM FINGAL Moan, ye winds, ye caverns call “Orro, orro!” to our sorrow, While we bear 'neath one black pall Brian, Murrough, from Fingal. Still though wasted, wounded, weary, On, Dalcassians! to your eyrie, Eagles, crying from your crag, “We have rent the Raven's flag.” How O'Brien's banshee cried, Wailing, warning, ere that morning, When the Lochlan in his pride Whitened all the ocean side. Sea-kings stern from Norway's highlands, Pirate chiefs from Orkney's Islands, Lords of Leinster, Britain, Wales, By the shore a thousand sails! “On this day,” great Brian cried To the foeman, “Jew and Roman Christ, our Saviour, crucified. Hold we truce till Easter-tide!” Loud rang back their impious laughter, “Fight comes first, thanksgiving after!” “Perish then, with shameful loss, Howling fiends before the Cross!” Plait and Donnell brand to brand First in raging wrath engaging, Heart pierced by each other's hand, Fell together on the strand. Then before the sword of Murrough Fled the Dane; till to our sorrow Anrud, Norway's champion dread, Murrough met—and both lay dead. But our rallying cry awoke, “Kian, Kian, Desmond's lion!” And, at Kian's dreadful stroke, Reeled the Lochlan ranks and broke. “Now with strains of martial glory To the King to tell our story,” But we found great Brian low; Och, ochone! och ullalo! Moan, ye winds, ye caverns call “Orro, orro!” to our sorrow, While we bear 'neath one black pall Brian, Murrough, from Fingal. Still though wasted, wounded, weary, On, Dalcassians! to your eyrie, Eagles, crying from your crag, “We have rent the Raven's flag.” SONGS OF CHIEFTAINS THE MARCH OF THE MAGUIRE My grief, Hugh Maguire, That to-night you must go To wreak your just ire On our murderous foe; For, hark! as the blast Thro' the bowed wood raves past, The great oaks, aghast, Rock, reel and crash below. Uncheered of your spouse, Without comfort or care, All night you must house In some lone, shaggy lair; The lightning your lamp, For your sentry the tramp Of the thunder round your camp; Hark! 'tis there, 'tis there! But to-morrow your sword More terrific shall sweep On our foe's monstrous horde Than this storm o'er the steep; And his mansions limewhite Flame with fearfuller light Than yon bolts thro' black night Hurled blazing down the deep. CHIEFTAIN OF TYRCONNELL Sore misery to Erin that you spread Your sails for far-off Espan, Hugh the Red! But sorest doom that on a foreign strand Quenched your keen eye, and from your falt'ring hand Struck down the faithful brand. Who now for us shall sweep the cattle spoil In bellowing tumult o'er the foamy Foyle? And till the steers are driv'n dispersed to sward, Hurl back, like thee, the Avenger from the ford, Hugh O'Donnell of the Sword? Who now upon the plunderers from the Pale Shall wreck the fiery vengeance of the Gael? With sudden onslaught strike the Saxon crew And smite them as you smote them, through and through— Chieftain of Tyrconnell, who? Last, who like thee, with comforts manifold Shall keep and cherish sick and poor and old? For, ah! thy open ever-flowing store Of food and drink and clothing, maet galore, Fails them now for evermore. THE FLIGHT OF THE EARLS To other shores across the sea We speed with swelling sail; Yet still there lingers on our lee A phantom Innisfail. Oh, fear not, fear not, gentle ghost, Your sons shall turn untrue! Though fain to fly your lovely coast, They leave their hearts with you. As slowly into distance dim Your shadow sinks and dies, So o'er the ocean's utmost rim Another realm shall rise; New hills shall swell, new vales expand, New rivers winding flow, But could we for a foster land Your mother love forego? Shall mighty Espan's martial praise Our patriot pulses still, And o'er your memory's fervent rays For ever cast a chill? Oh no! we live for your relief, Till, home from alien earth, We share the smile that gilds your grief, The tear that gems your mirth. LOVED BRIDE OF O'BYRNE Oh! loud keens the wind by peak and pass From Lugnaquillia to lone Kippure, Fierce, fierce fall the flakes in Glenmacnass, Deep mounts the drift in Glenmalure. But shrill as the shrillest blasts that blow, Ochone! The Gaval Rannall cry, For whiter, colder, stiller than the snow, Loved Bride of our O'Byrne, you lie. Black, black o'er the mountains cloud on cloud Comes gliding while we bear beneath White, white on our shoulders in her shroud, Our dearest to the door of death. Ah! hark, how wild Avonbeg above Wails back to moaning Avonmore, “For ever now the faithful lamp of love Is quenched in frowning Ballin'core.” LAMENT FOR OWEN ROE O'NEILL Oh! black breaks the morrow in tempest and gloom, When we bear to our sorrow O'Neill to the tomb. Whilst with wailing and weeping the long, long train Comes woefully weeping o'er Uladh's dark plain. 'Twas not reaving their cattle, you fell, Owen Roe, Or in red, raging battle, your face to the foe. But the black snake of treason they sent, O'Neill, To pierce you with poison since you scoffed at their steel. Oh! leader God-gifted, oh! arm stern of stroke, That well-nigh had lifted from our shoulders the yoke, Your death-bell is ringing our doom, our doom, For with you we are bringing our hopes to the tomb! HEROINES OF LIMERICK Faugh-a-balleach! Munster men, Once more your dogged foe defying, Though ye count as one to ten, Forth, forth to rout the Dutch again! Faugh-a-balleach! 'Tis for greed They strike, but we for Faith and Freedom; For a despot's throne they bleed, But we for Erin's sacred need. Faugh-a-balleach! At your side With shot and shell and rifle ready, Pale and gaunt and hollow-eyed, Stand Mother, Daughter, Sister, Bride. Faugh-a-balleach! Hark! they cry, “We, too, are here to share your glory; Or if dark defeat be nigh, With you the proudest death to die!” ROSEEN DHU I. THE SHADOW OF A DREAM O! sorrowful dream of the past That dissolved in the morn's magic ray, Why again is thy grey shadow cast Like a false, fairy mist o'er my way? Yet the war-ships ride on through the bay With the King's flag aflame from each mast. Oh! Liberty, when shall thy day Light the pale brows of Erin at last? II. MY ROSE OF HOPE. For Erin's sake I've faced the field of slaughter, I've shared her smiles and mixed with hers my tears, And, oh! her rarest, fairest, fondest daughter Is now my rose of hope, my rue of fears. Yet, when we parted in the forest shadow, Oh! there was that within her wondrous eyes That sent me singing down the primrose meadow, As if I'd found the path to Paradise! III. HER ANSWER The earth is as green as fairy rings, The air one flutter and flash of wings, The heath and clover a-buzz with bees And white, white over the hawthorn trees; While up, high up, on his sunbeam stair, The lark goes dancing my joy to share; For, oh! by his song he surely knows The answer I've won from my little dark Rose! IV. THE CLARION'S CALL The clarion's crying! the drum's replying; From cliff to cave the beacons wave Their fiery fingers, now he who lingers Is but a slave—a crouching slave! Adieu! adieu! my Roseen Dhu, Adieu! adieu! adieu! adieu! “O draw your rein,” she cried again “O! let me bide with you! Let me ride with you!” So together, by hills of heather And moorland brown, we thundered down, With glancing steel and dancing feather, To Limerick town, to Limerick town. Now o'er the Shannon, With roaring cannon And roll of drums, our foeman comes; His carbines rattle! O, God of battle, Our cause defend unto the end! V. SHE STOOD AT MY SIDE She stood at my side, my bride, my own Roseen Dhu, Though with death laden bullet on bullet the air was athrill, In her fair bloom to dare doom, While the foe ever fiercer grew, To the storm flying swarm upon swarm; Yet we beat them backward still. But with fell fireballs still battering our walls till they brake, Again to the onset flashed the fierce Saxon stream. Then with white hand a bright brand Waving, “Onward!” she cried, “for Erin's sake!” Down we leapt, on we sternly swept, Till we clashed in the shock supreme. But as their spear hedge, like sedge, mowing down amain, Out, out of the city we hurled our headlong foes, Through the dread shout and the red rout, Where she cheered our charge to the plain, Shrieked a shell! dead my darling fell! Oh! my grief! Oh! my woe of woes! Oh! sorrowful shades of the Past, Caught for one magic moment away, Again you are gathering fast, Like false, fairy mists o'er our way! THE WILD GEESE AH, WHY, PATRICK SARSFIELD Ah, why, Patrick Sarsfield, did we let your ships sail Away to French Flanders from green Innisfail? For far from your country you lie cold and low; Ah, why, Patrick Sarsfield, ah, why did you go? We pray'd, Patrick Sarsfield, to see you sail home, Your flag waving victory above the white foam. But still in our fetters, poor slaves, we live on; For, oh, Patrick Sarsfield, for, oh, you are gone! SHULE AGRA! His hair was black, his eye was blue, His arm was stout, his word was true; I wish in my heart I was with you! Go-thee-thu, mavourneen slaun! Shule, shule, shule agra! Only death can ease my woe, Since the lad of my heart from me did go, Go-thee-thu, mavourneen slaun! 'Tis oft I sat on my true love's knee, Many a fond story he told to me, He told me things that ne'er shall be, Go-thee-thu, mavourneen slaun! Shule, shule, shule agra! Only death can ease my woe, Since the lad of my heart from me did go, Go-thee-thu, mavourneen slaun! I sold my rock, I sold my reel; When my flax was spun I sold my wheel To buy my love a sword of steel, Go-thee-thu, mavourneen slaun! Shule, shule, shule agra! Only death can ease my woe, Since the lad of my heart from me did go, Go-thee-thu, mavourneen slaun! But when King James was forced to flee, The Wild Geese spread their wings to sea, And bore mabouchal far from me, Go-thee-thu, mavourneen slaun! Shule, shule, shule agra! Only death can ease my woe, Since the lad of my heart from me did go, Go-thee-thu, mavourneen slaun! I saw them sail from Brandon Hill, Then down I sat and cried my fill, That every tear would turn a mill, Go-thee-thu, mavourneen slaun! Shule, shule, shule agra! Only death can ease my woe, Since the lad of my heart from me did go, Go-thee-thu, mavourneen slaun! I wish the King would return to reign, And bring my true love back again; I wish, and wish, but I wish in vain, Go-thee-thu, mavourneen slaun! Shule, shule, shule agra! Only death can ease my woe, Since the lad of my heart from me did go, Go-thee-thu, mavourneen slaun! I'll dye my petticoat, I'll dye it red, And round the world I'll beg my bread, Till I find my love alive or dead, Go-thee-thu, mavourneen slaun! Shule, shule, shule agra! Only death can ease my woe, Since the lad of my heart from me did go, Go-thee-thu, mavourneen slaun! THE SAILOR GIRL When the Wild Geese were flying to Flanders away, I clung to my Desmond beseeching him stay, But the stern trumpet sounded the summons to sea, And afar the ship bore him, mabouchal machree. And first he sent letters, and then he sent none, And three times into prison I dreamt he was thrown; So I shore my long tresses, and stain'd my face brown, And went for a sailor from Limerick town. Oh! the ropes cut my fingers, but steadfast I strove Till I reached the Low Country in search of my love. There I heard how at Namur his heart was so high That they carried him captive, refusing to fly. With that to King William himself I was brought, And his mercy for Desmond with tears I besought. He considered my story, then smiling, says he, “The young Irish rebel for your sake is free.” “Bring the varlet before us. Now, Desmond O'Hea, Myself has decided your sentence to-day— You must marry your sailor with bell, book, and ring, And here is her dowry,” cried William the King! SHE IS MY LOVE She is my love beyond all thought, Though she has wrought my deepest dole; Yet dearer for the cruel pain Than one who fain would make me whole. She is my glittering gem of gems, Who yet contemns my fortune bright; Whose cheek but glows with redder scorn Since mine has worn a stricken white. She is my sun and moon and star, Who yet so far and cold doth keep, She would not even o'er my bier One tender tear of pity weep. Into my heart unsought she came, A wasting flame, a haunting care; Into my heart of hearts, ah! why? And left a sigh for ever there. THE COLLEEN DONN My Colleen Donn of the golden glances, The storm black tresses and the shape of snow, 'Tis little surely your light heart fancies How for your sake a grieving man I go. The lone night long under woe I'm waking, While you are taking the joys of sleep; The bright day through, while you bless another, Your troth plight breaking, like a ghost I creep. My Colleen Donn of the dancing dimple, The soft discourses and the love-lit eyes, How true I thought you, how fresh and simple In every wish, oh! how unworldly wise! My Colleen Donn, there was that about you, None dared to doubt you—yet you're gone, you're gone! My winter's warmth, and my summer's shadow, I'm but lost without you, my own Colleen Donn. THE MINSTREL LOVER We met when roses wreathed the grey ramparts of O'Connor, She a maid of Royal blood, her proud father's minstrel I; Her eyes looked love in mine, but my lips were sealed by honour, So I sailed from Connaught kind for Espan's alien sky; But her last faithful glance cheered my gloom and charmed my slumbers, And I toiled on in trust that her hand I yet might claim, Till the harp her spirit swayed thrilled all Europe with its numbers, And the chief of Erin's poets for her dear sake I became. Her haughty father sped, again I sought her castle, For the joyous Beltane feast as a roaming bard arrayed, And when each minstrel else had made music for the wassail, Before my lady bright I stood forth once more and played. I told my tale of love, and when its transport ended, Cast off my wanderer's weeds and my name of fame confessed; In her rapture she arose—from her silver seat descended, And owned me her heart's lord before each glittering guest. I SHALL NOT DIE FOR LOVE OF THEE O, Woman, shapely as the swan, Shall I turn wan for looks from thee? Nay bend those blue love-darting eyes On men unwise, they wound not me. Red lips and ripe and rose soft cheek, Shall limbs turn weak and colour flee, And languorous grace and foam-white form, Shall still blood storm because of ye? Thy slender waist, thy cool of gold In ringlets rolled around thy knee, Thy scented sighs and looks of flame They shall not tame my spirit free. For, Woman, shapely as the swan, A wary man hath nurtured me; White neck and arm, bright lip and eye, I shall not die for love of ye! A LAMENT Dark, dark drives the tempest o'er Erin to-day, And rends the green leaf from the writhing oak spray; Thus struggling forlorn under Heaven's blackest cope, Heart tortured we mourn the crushed crown of our hope. Through foemen unnumber'd, in proud undismay, To Freedom's pure heights he still won us the way; Till planting elate on the proud peak our flag, The fierce bolt of fate dashed him dead from the crag. Moan, hollow wind, moan! weep, weep, heavy cloud, Sob for sob, tear for tear, for the chief in his shroud! Ochone! and ochoro! our Heart, Hand and Head, To our black, bitter sorrow on the bier you lie dead! LOVELY ANNE Lovely Anne, my lovely Anne! Oh, hearken to my bitter cry! Alone, on rugged Slievenaman, For your fond sake I lie; For you I've fled my friends, fled my clan, Fair Saxon, have you turned untrue? And has my lovely Anne, my lovely Anne, But brought me here to rue? Lovely Anne, oh, lovely Anne, Since darkly here I laid me down, How oft the wind-swept cannavaun Has seem'd your flutt'ring gown; And once a maid, with bright milking can, Brush'd hitherward across the dew, “'Tis she, my lovely Anne, my lovely Anne!” She turned and frown'd me through. Lovely Anne, oh, lovely Anne! Cold morn is mounting o'er the height, And your forsaken Irishman Afar must take his flight. Heaven's curse upon the black, heartless ban, That sunders thus the fond and true. Adieu, my lovely Anne, my lovely Anne, For evermore adieu! SONGS OF THE GAEL KITTY BAWN Before the first ray of blushing day Who should come by but Kitty Bawn, With her cheek like the rose on a bed of snows, And her bosom beneath like the sailing swan. I looked and looked till my heart was gone. With the foot of the fawn she crossed the lawn, Half confiding and half in fear; And her eyes of blue they thrilled me through One blessed minute; then like the deer Away she started and left me here. Oh, Sun, you are late at your golden gate, For you've nothing to show beneath the sky To compare to the lass who crossed the grass Of the shamrock field ere the dew was dry, And the glance she gave me as she went by. BESIDE THE RIVER LOUNE Nevermore, where yon ash is weeping, Old and hoar, over Loune, Nevermore shall my heart go leaping At the glance of her gown. Nevermore, when snowflakes falling Blanch the wrinkled, writhing boughs, Shall I hear my love's voice kindly calling Her “Come home!” to the cows. O'er our tryst by the lone Loune water, At the Ford of the Sloes, Crept the mist, while the wild brown water In anger arose. Step by step each ford stone seeking, She shimmered at my side, But a sudden spate it swept her shrieking Down the red, raging tide. All night with the flood fiend wrestling I sought her forlorn, Till amid the blue forget-me-not nestling I found her at morn. Like a maiden of marble moulded, All at peace my love lay there, With her hands upon her bosom folded, Meekly folded in prayer. LAST NIGHT I DREAMT OF MY OWN TRUE LOVE Last night I dreamt of my own true love! Methought, methought beneath the stars There fluttered, fluttered at my casement bars A wildly wailing turtle dove. I caught him in, and lo! I found A letter to his bosom bound. But when the ribbon I untwined That wreathed his wing of restless snow, By his dark welling life-blood's flow Alas! 'twas all incarnadined, Deep crimson as the letter's seal From out a wound no art could heal. I made my sobbing bird a nest Within my softly shelt'ring arms; His panting pain, his wild alarms I lulled at last to languid rest; When, oh! with my own true love's eyes He wakes and looks me through and dies. O, BRANCH OF FRAGRANT BLOSSOM O, branch of fragrant blossom, How the heart in my bosom Lay heaving before you with hopeless sigh; Till your voice grew low and tender, And a soft, love-lit splendour Shone out to save me from your dark, dreamy eye. O, branch of rosy blossom, Radiant bride of my bosom, My heart heaves no longer with hopeless sigh; For you're the blessed shadow Upon my burning meadow, My sunshine in winter, and my love till I die. ALONE, ALL ALONE When westward I'm called, 'Tis not east I'd be going. Should I sup the salt wave With the pure spring to hand, Or prefer the base weed To the richest rose blowing, Or not follow my own love The first through the land? Oh, my heart is a fountain Of sorrow unspoken, A virgin nut-cluster Untimely down torn! And, oh, but my heart Flutters bleeding and broken, Like a bird beating out Its wild life on a thorn. His cheek is the hue Of the blackberry blossom, And blackberry blue His dark tresses above; And I'm cryin' without, Who should lie in his bosom, And I doubt and I doubt If he's true to his love. 'Tis time I should part you, Proud, hurrying City; For your tongues they cut sharper By far than your stone, And your hearts than that same Are more hardened to pity; So my love I'll go seeking, Alone, all alone! SINCE WE'RE APART Since we're apart, since we're apart, The weariness and lonely smart Are going greatly round my heart; Upon my pillow, ere I sleep, The full of my two shoes I weep, And like a ghost all day I creep. 'Tis what you said you'd never change Or with another ever range, Now ev'n the Church is cold and strange. There side by side our seats we took, There side by side we held one book; But with another now you look. And when the service it was o'er, We'd walk the meadow's flow'ry floor, As we shall walk and walk no more. For while beneath the starry glow, Ye two sit laughing light and low, A shade among the shades I go. O LOVE, 'TIS A CALM, STARRY NIGHT O love, 'tis a calm, starry night; No breath stirs the leaves below; My steed is at the door And my ship is by the shore, Then come down to me, my darling, and away, away we'll go; Then come down, and far, and far away we'll go. Your guardian is sleeping above, Base churl, with his taunt and blow! The house is all at rest; Only you that I love best Like a busy mouse keep rustling to and fro, To make ready still keep rustling to and fro. Now soft you come stealing down the stair! My heart it is all in a glow; O, stay your silent tears, O, cease your maiden fears! For the world's wealth I'd never from you go, or work you woe! For the world's wealth how could I use you so. OVER HERE Oh, the praties they are small, Over here, over here! Oh, the praties they are small, Over here! Oh, the praties they are small, And we dig them in the fall, And we eat them coats and all, Full of fear, full of fear. Oh, I wish we all were geese, Night and morn, night and morn, Oh, I wish we all were geese, Night and morn! Oh, I wish we all were geese, For they live and die in peace, Till the hour of their decease, Stuffing corn, stuffing corn. Oh, we're down into the dust, Over here, over here! Oh, we're down into the dust, Over here! Oh, we're down into the dust, But the God in Whom we trust, Will yet give us crumb for crust, Over here, over here! REMEMBER THE POOR Oh! remember the poor when your fortune is sure, And acre to acre you join; Oh! remember the poor, though but slender your store, And you ne'er can go gallant and fine. Oh! remember the poor when they cry at your door In the raging rain and blast; Call them in, cheer them up with the bite and the sup, Till they leave you their blessing at last. The red fox has his lair, and each bird of the air With the night settles warm in his nest, But the King who laid down His celestial crown For our sakes, He had nowhere to rest. Oh! the poor were forgot till their pitiful lot He bowed Himself to endure; If your souls ye would make, for His Heavenly sake, Oh! remember, remember the poor. A LULLABY I've found my bonny babe a nest On Slumber Tree; I'll rock you there to rosy rest, Astore machree! Oh, lulla lo! sing all the leaves On Slumber Tree; Till everything that hurts or grieves Afar must flee. I'd put my pretty child to float Away from me, Within the new moon's silver boat On Slumber Sea. And when your starry sail is o'er, From Slumber Sea, My precious one, you'll step to shore On Mother's knee. LIKE A STONE IN THE STREET I'm left all alone like a stone at the side of the street, With no kind “good day” on the way from the many I meet. Still with looks cold and high they go by, not one brow now unbends, None holds out his hand of the band of my fair-weather friends. They helped me to spend to its end all my fine shining store, They drank to my health and my wealth until both were no more. And now they are off with a scoff as they leave me behind, “When you've ate the rich fruit, under foot with the bare, bitter rind.” There's rest deep and still on yon hill by our old church's side, Where I laid you long ago, to my woe, my young one year's bride. Then, ochone! for relief from my grief into madness I flew. Would to God ere that day in the clay I'd been covered with you! THE SONGS ERIN SINGS I've heard the lark's cry thrill the sky o'er the meadows of Lusk, And the first joyous gush of the thrush from Adare's April wood, At thy lone music's spell, Philomel, magic stricken I've stood, When in Espan afar star on star trembled out of the dusk. While Dunkerron's blue dove murmured love, 'neath her nest I have sighed, And by mazy Culdaff with a laugh mocked the cuckoo's refrain, Derrycarn's dusky bird I have heard piping joy hard by pain, And the swan's last lament sobbing sent over Moyle's mystic tide. Yet as bright shadows pass from the glass of the darkening lake, As the rose's rapt sigh must die, when the zephyr is stilled; In oblivion grey sleeps each lay that those birds ever trilled, But the songs Erin sings from her strings shall immortally wake. THE ROVING PEDLAR Do you mind the glad day When we ranged, we two, o'er the green, Amid the white May, On the borders of lovely Lough Lene, How out of the road came the roving old pedlar's long cry: “Come buy my pretty wares, pretty wares, come buy, come buy!” Not a cloud in the air, All the woods one warble of song, And we just a pair Of wood-pigeons coo-cooing along; When he, overhearing us, cunningly alters his cry: “Wedding poplins, wedding veils, wedding rings! come buy, come buy!” One look in my eyes And you took, mabouchaleen bawn, My third finger's size With a ribbon of rustling finane; And when he'd the wedding ring sold, that old pedlar so sly, “Just that poplin, just that veil, just those gloves,” he coaxed us to buy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A GAELIC STORY-TELLING A SHENACHUS We were some of us old, but the more of us young; Yet each of us shamed for the slip of our Tongue; And studying, so, just as busy as Brownies, At those little green primers of good Father Growney's. When the gas jets a sudden strange jumping fit took, And the print grew so dim in each slim Gaelic book, That the teacher, our own Creeveen Eveen himself, His volume laid by with a laugh on the shelf, “And,” says he, “boys and girls, by this gas dhoul we're bet. But we've got a full hour for a Shenachus yet. So out with the gas, a fit light for a serf, And heap up instead a big bonfire of turf!” One blast of the bellows—it yellows, it glows, While a swirl of blue smoke up the black chimney goes. “Now range yourselves all in a ring round the fire, The priest by the parson, the clerk by the squire; The landlord true blue facing tenants true green, With madam and maiden mixed nicely between; While Michael Mac Art fresh from Trinity College First gives us a taste of his Classical knowledge; For a little bird told me, that always was wise, He's a poem sent in for the Chancellor's prize! He doesn't deny it—Now, Michael, man, start, For each girl on your Orpheus has just set her heart. Colleens, isn't it so?” “Yes, indeed,” cried the girls, So Michael he twitched for awhile at his curls, Then held up his head and this old Grecian lay Of Eurydice's Orpheus he chanted away. ORPHEUS AND EURYDICE As fair Eurydice, with footfall light, Roved the Thessalian woods one moonlit night, Singing amidst the gentle Naiad throng, Who ranged attentive to her voice, a song That her own Orpheus taught her; suddenly Aristæus, hot with honey-wine, comes by, Follows the music ardently, and ere The singer and the listening nymphs are 'ware, Leaps in their midst, and, kindling to her charms, Clasps at Eurydice with eager arms. She, the sweet melody on her lovely lips Snapt with a scream, from his embraces slips, And crying: “Orpheus, Orpheus!” swift as light, Flies from the woods, he following, through the night; Until, escaped from the pursuer's hand, O'er the full Hebrus she has swum to land. When, through the shelter of the sloping sward, A hooded snake that haunts the river ford Shoots its lithe length to meet her from the ground, And, ere she sees it, darts a deadly wound. She still would flee, if but she still may reach Her home, now nigh, and find a friendly leech, Or die at least in her dear love's embrace. But the black poison runs a swifter race! Her footsteps fail, her limbs their force forget, Her fluttering sighs came fast and faster yet; The landscape swims around—she falters, falls— Thrice strives to rise, and thrice on Orpheus calls, Each cry a fainter echo of the last, And murmuring “Orpheus” still, the gentle spirit passed. Then Aristæus, stricken with remorse, Braves the loud flood, and kneels beside her corse, And chafes her hands, and every art essays From her last sleep the lovely nymph to raise. But all in vain, and, turning with a tear, Slow he retraces his too swift career. Anon the Naiads from the general flight Toward their Hebrus one by one unite; And when—ah! woeful hap—they see her slain, Beat their white breasts, and lift the cry of pain. Woods, vales and mountains mingle in the dirge, The desolate river sobs from verge to verge; And Night herself, veiling her starry eyes, Leads the lament with long-drawn tempest sighs. O, say not that two sympathetic souls Can only mix as outward sense controls. Far off the mother of an only daughter, Pierced with her pangs, has tremblingly resought her; The absent brother feels the fatal power That strikes the partner of his natal hour; And the fond youth, beneath far distant skies, Knows the sad moment when his mistress dies. Thus Orpheus, who had left his lovely spouse For Delphi's steep to pay his filial vows To King Apollo, starts from sleep to hear His name thrice shrieked with anguish in his ear; To earth he starts—a weapon wildly snatches— Hies through the hall, the darkling door unlatches, And stands bewildered in the moonlight clear, Crying, “Eurydice, your love is here;” Till the night air on his uncovered brows Blowing awhile his woe-stunned wits arouse. But sense no solace yields, and, as he flies With homeward haste, still dark and darker rise Death's phantom fears, till on the dewy lea Orpheus has clasped his cold Eurydice, And laid alone by her with weeping strong And sobs tempestuous tosses all day long. Then King Apollo pitying the pain Of his dear son, whom most he loved of men, Stands by his side, his awful beauty veiling In softest cloud, and thus rebukes his wailing: “Rise, Orpheus, rise, infatuate with grief; Orpheus arise, Apollo brings relief; For not in vain hast thou required my favour With filial vows and first fruits sweet of savour; Nor idly did thy docile genius follow The magic music of thy sire Apollo. No Marsyas thou, but reverently mute To hear and learn the language of my lute, And therefore thou of living men alone Canst charm all cruel force with music's moan. “For this did Jason, warned of Chiron old, In choice of Questers for the Fleece of Gold, Prefer thee helmsman of the hero crew Of Argo, wisely yielding thee thy due; Else had they never rowed to Colchian seas Past those gray cliffs, the dread Symplegades. For, as with oars that to thy harpening clear In cadence dipped, the desperate course they steer, From the almost shock the shores resilient flew Rapt to thy lay and let the Questers through. “Thou too, when far upon the Western Main Fierce thirst possessed the Heroes, with thy strain Alone could'st win from the Hesperian Maids The golden offspring of their orchard shades; And after, when the Argonautic oars Approached too near those bark-beguiling shores, Where bleach the bones of many a music-slain Mariner—and the Siren Sisters' strain Was with its amorous enchantment stealing Each Quester's soul, thy heavenly pæan pealing, Struck dumb the weird witch-music, and reclaimed Their service due, who else The Quest had shamed.” “And what avails that skill,” the mourner sighs, “Oh! father mine, when low my mistress lies; Though, when I luted, love stole softly o'er her, The song that won her never can restore her.” “Orpheus, I heard you once, when stars were clear, Echoing the strains that thrill from sphere to sphere; You sang, whilst Argo o'er the ocean hoary Leaped to thy lay, Creation's awful story. Softly you sang, and though you knew it not, Nature was tranced around in troubled thought, Fearful lest thou should'st wake that louder lay Intolerable, that shook her natal day. Idly she feared, for I of gods and men, Save Love alone, have knowledge of that strain, And I but once its music can recall. Yet, for I love thee, Son, yea more than all My children, and now pity bride-bereft, Thee I endue with my transcendent gift, The song of songs, to whose ecstatic strain Informing Love from Chaos' dread inane Called the young Cosmos. Lift that psalm again, And earth shall quake, the Empyrean lower, Seas rage, and at the last the Infernal Power Ope to thy lay the inexorable door, And thy lost mistress to thine arms restore.” He said, and vanished, whilst a rosy source Of sudden sunset, flowing, found the corse, Kissed her cold feet, suffused her bosom's snow, Blushed in her cheek, and melted on her brow. Then Orpheus: “For the dim discoloured light Of Hymen's torch upon my nuptial night, This radiant omen, Phœbus, I accept;” Whilst o'er the lute his eager fingers swept, Preluding softly to that mystic strain, Which he but wakened once, and none shall wake again. Then the sphere-music stole upon the harp, Pregnant with rapturous pain and pleasure sharp. All things that are, enchanted, paused to hear, Save the small growths that sprang to be more near, For Joy and Sorrow, Love and Life, and Death Trembled together in that tuneful breath. Anon the wild sphere-music louder grew, Loud as when first the parent atoms flew Of air and water, fire and formless earth, Each seed to share an elemental birth; For to that cadence arched the skyey dome, The soft soil hardened, Ocean sought his home, While shapes of sea and landscape loom around, Till sun and moon and stars the night astound, With living lustre leaping to the sound; And verdure springs, and with the breathing form The earth and air and ocean sudden swarm; And last of all, to crown Creation's plan, Awakes to life the myriad-minded man. But, on the even of that natal day, Love's louder song had died into the lay, That, all too subtle sweet for mortal ears, Thrills with eternal music through the spheres. Orpheus alone had caught that softer strain, And, as he wakes it now, his eager brain, Inspired by Phœbus, links the sound subdued To its loud, long-forgotten parent mood. So lutes he, and so sings, with flashing eyes And dark dishevelled locks that fall and rise O'er his rent vesture to the cadence wild. Eve fades—night blackens—and Apollo's child, Unseen as Philomel, pours his passionate thought; Whilst round him all the universe, distraught By the fierce frenzy of his awful lyre, All breathing forms; Earth, Ocean, Air and Fire, Hear and make moan, as each indwelling essence That forms them feels the old Creative Presence Maddening their rest, and drawing them to mix In other moulds, and all that is perplex. Till at the sphere song, out of centuried sleep Old Chaos rears her from the utmost deep, Deeming perchance that erst obnoxious hymn Favourable now unto her empire dim. Then rocked the earth for fear, the vaulted heaven Thundered aghast, far leaped the affrighted levin, Shook the deep sea dismayed, and, at the last, Through the song-severed gates of hell the poet passed Hard by the hideous porch a spectral crew Deform first meet the minstrel's anxious view; Grief, Labour, Care, Disease, and tristful Age And Fear and Famine, War, Revenge and Rage; But shape most dread of all the demon Death, With infant face distort, a maid beneath, Yet with lean palsied arms and locks of eld, Who first from far the approaching bard beheld And fain to startle him to swift retreat, Begins: “O fool, what strain to Death is sweet? Essay no further, lest this countenance In wrath revealed consume thee at a glance. Or canst thou, front to front opposed, outstare Her whose fierce eyes' intolerable glare, Spite all the horrors of her serpent brow, And hellish aspect, laid Medusa low!” She said, but Orpheus struck his saddest chord, Wept the fell fiend, and past her haunt abhorred The youth unhurt pursued his darkling way, Till at his feet the Stygian river lay, And rustling round him stole those bloodless ranks That wait expectant on the oozy banks For Charon's bark; but that grim senior rowed Toward the further shore his goblin load. Then Orpheus for Eurydice the lost Eager pursues all that phantom host, But vainly, when outspake a giant ghost, Whose shoulders topped the crowd, “O comrade dear, Orpheus divine, what quest has led thee here? Alive! O strange, as first I sought this shore, Admetus' bride, Alcestis to restore, And with these hands, how forceless now, alas! Fettered the Triple Hound all fear to pass. Surely some bitter cause thy suppliant dress, Dishevelled hair, and downcast eyes confess?” Then Orpheus weeping, “Ah me! grief on grief, No woe is single, thou too here, my chief, Whom yesterday sang Victor! Then she crossed The Ninefold-Stream before thy life was lost, For, by a serpent slain, Eurydice, My bride is hither borne. Oh! woe is me! Her now I seek; but what fate forced thee here, Whom of old Argo's crew I loved most dear?” Then great Alcides tells the jealous wile Of Deianeira by the Centaur's guile Malignant fraught with poison pain and fire Life-ridding on his self-sought funeral pyre. “Console thee, Herakles, my comrade dear;” Orpheus presaged, “For short space art thou here. It only needs to expiate the ire Of Dis, conceived what time his hell hound dire Thy might o'ermastered, that, as you weak ghosts, As forceless thou awhile should'st range his coasts. Right soon from Hell exempt, with honours meet, Thee Gods shall welcome to a heavenly seat Constellate in their midst, and, for the love Of woman, bless with Hebe's bower above.” Now Charon brings his boat once more to land, And Orpheus hastes his service to demand; But with a hateful scowl the ferryman In scornful answer to his suit began: “Back, rash intruder in the realms of dark, For, long as I direct the Stygian bark, No sprite embodied enters it again,” He said; but Orpheus woke a soothing strain, So sweet, so softly wildering the brain, That all his grisly length old Charon slept, Then lightly to his seat the poet stepped, And, singing, o'er the stream with easy oarage swept. Stretched on the further shore the Triple Hound Owns with a troubled voice the magic sound, Whom Orpheus passed, and through the palace-gate Of Hell still presses on with hope elate, Until at last before the dusky throne Of Dis and Proserpine he casts him down. Whom, sternly eying, Pluto straight addressed: “Stranger, declare thy name and what thy quest. No Tityos sure, nor with Alcides' might Hast thou approached the realms of Nether Night; My minions have been mocked with panic error, If thou, effeminate form, hast caused them terror. Speak, but expect no grace.” Then Proserpine Broke in, “My Lord, 'tis Orpheus, the divine, Offspring of Phœbus and Calliope, Who, when the Fleece-quest neared sweet Sicily, His descant tuned, till e'en the sea-beach smiled, To bright-eyed blossom by his song beguiled. Then Orpheus, with fresh heart, awoke this litany wild. “Not out of impious lust, O! Nameless Name, Nor friend for friend, as Herakles hither came, Have I adventured to thine Empire dread. No might of mine—ay, well this downcast head And feeble limbs provoke thy sharpest scorn. Not his poor prowess hath thy servant borne Thus strangely past thy guardian forms of fear, Charon and Cereberus, and set unscathed here. A Power Eternal bears me from above— Now, in my need, forsake me not, O Love!” On whom so crying bitterly a great change, With tremor fierce and sighing thick and strange, Smote suddenly—his labouring limbs assume Stature divine, his front immortal bloom; Erect he starts, a sudden halo bright Burns from his brow, beneath whose living light His eyes, bright stars in bluest heaven, shed Ethereal influence through that palace dread, Whilst his sweet voice divine rings forth amongst the dead, Singing the lives of those two lovers fond, How dutiful in youth, then how beyond Compare in piety; and how they loved A long, long love, that but the purer proved By bitter ordeal; their brief nuptial bliss And latest parting; last the envenomed kiss Of the fierce serpent, when with flying foot Scarce had Eurydice foiled the vile pursuit Of Aristæus, and how she failed and fell And made her death-bed in the asphodel. Here paused the voice awhile, but soon again Awaking, poured a most enchanting strain Of a fair goddess in Sicilian meads, And Eros charioting those dusky steeds Soft o'er the lily leaves and grasses green, And to the King of Night bearing his beauteous Queen. Last the voice sang how that deep love divine Had never quenched in Dis or Proserpine, Or failed in anywise of Eros' aid, For which dear services that sweet voice prayed Eurydice's reprieve with its last breath, Then on the darkness died a most delicious death. The bold song ceased; but, ere its echo died, Pluto repents him, and to Minos cried: “Eurydice is free, 'tis thine to fix The law that leads the lovers o'er the Styx Unto the Upper Light!” Whose stern decree Bids Orpheus lead his dear Eurydice, But not to turn, nor look upon his love, Till they have safely reached the realms above. Then forth they fare, the living and the dead; He first, she following with painful tread; Till every peril passed and ghostly dread, Upon the very threshold of the day, Fearful lest that dear shape had gone astray, Orpheus looks back. O, fool! for close behind His love still followed with a faithful mind; But scarce had turned him, when that well-known form, Half-spectre still, yet momently more warm With waking life, dissolves with shrill despair And looks of anguish on the nether air. Rose as she sank a universal knell, And leaped together the loud gates of hell. Seven days and nights he strives, but strives in vain, Once more to wake that elemental strain, Nourished the while on nought but tearful sorrow; But with the eighth inexorable morrow He sadly rose, one look of longing cast On Tænarus, and sighing Thraceward passed. And three long years, amidst the lost one's bowers, Wandered, wild warbling to her favourite flowers Laments more melancholy sweet than ever Echo had answered by the Hebrus' river. Thus on Eurydice his constant thought Still fixed, no solace of fresh love he sought; Till as he sleeps outworn within that wood Whence she whilere had flown towards the flood, Exasperate each at Orpheus' slights of love, A Mænad troop steal on him through the grove, Of whom one snatches swiftly from the ground His lute, low-shivering with ill-omened sound. “Io,” exultant! “Io!” through the brakes The Bacchants shout, and shuddering Orpheus wakes, But helpless quite, as of his lyre forlorn, By the wild women limb from limb is torn. “Eurydice!” the passing spirit cries; “Eurydice!” the troubled vale replies; “Eurydice!” afar, each snowy summit sighs. For a minute or more we sat holding our breath In our Shenachus circle, as silent as death; Till a colleen cried out “Ah, why wouldn't he wait Till he'd passed the poor dear through that pitiless gate, Before he looked back and so lost her sweet life? Behaving as badly, all out, as Lot's wife, And deserving, as well, for his desperate fault, To be struck where he stood to a statue of salt!” “Tut, tut, my dear girl,” answered sly Shiel O'Farrell; To The Black Powers alone he gave cause for a quarrel— Or, to make the distinction a notion more nice, He looked back upon Virtue, but she upon Vice; And besides to his sweetheart he proved himself true, Till his death at the hands of that Bacchanal crew. May young poet McArt there preserve his limbs sound, For I'm told some wild women are running around, So bitterly bent upon making our Laws That Prime Ministers, even, ar'n't safe from their claws.” “Now, now, Shiel O'Farrell,” An Creeveen spoke out, “By our Gaelic League law, which you've studied no doubt, I protest that you've crossed the Political Border, And, therefore, must rule you as clean out of order. But instead of a proper pecuniary fine, If the Sex you impugn to support me incline, I pronounce that you purge yourself clear of your crime By relating some countryside story in rhyme, For a packfull you've got, 'tis well known, of the best! By your wonderful fiddle charmed out of the West.” And the ladies all clapped to acclaim his behest. So the Doctor breathed deep till he'd filled up his chest, To the Chair and the Fair bowed long and bowed low, Then took up his tale of The Colleen na Mbo THE GIRL WITH THE COWS O the happiest orphan that ever was seen Was Nora Maguire at the age of eighteen; Her father and mother both died at her birth, So grief for their sakes didn't trouble her mirth. Nora Maguire was the flower of girls Wid her laughin' blue eye and her sunny bright curls, Wid her mouth's merry dimple, her head's purty poise, And a foot that played puck right and left wid the boys; Yes! her looks were a fortun'; yet curious to tell Sweet Nora Maguire was an heiress as well, For her father had left his dear child at his death Half a hundred of cows at the side of the heath; Where Nora na Mo in a handsome slate house Wid her granny looked after the sheep and the cows; For, behind all the fun that her features evince, Mistress Nora Maguire has lashins of sinse; But though Nora was careful she never was mean, But, dear as the dew to the hot summer plain, She'd go stealin' the poor and the sick to relieve, Unbeknownst in the hush of the dawn or the eve; And no girl in the service at chapel took part Who followed the priest wid a faithfuller heart, And no sound in the anthem rose truer and higher Than the fresh, fervent voice of sweet Nora Maguire. But that didn't make darlin' Nora desire To adjourn to the convent on lavin' the choir— No! It's thinkin' I am, where's the use to conceal Her first thought after chapel was Patrick O'Neale, Wid his dark handsome looks, and his deep earnest voice, The pet of the colleens—the pride of the boys. For there wasn't a boy in Dunkerron was able To dance on the ground as he could on the table; Or sing in ould Irish wid beautif'ller shakes Sweeter songs or laments at our weddings and wakes; Or tell by the fire of a dark winter's night Tales that crowded us closer together for fright. And where's the turf cuttin' or boghole so broad, But he'd clear like a hare hoppin' off of the road? At what fence would he falter or alter his steps, And who could approach him at throwin' three leaps? And on Sunday at hurley, who rooshed on the ball Wid such fury as Pat through the thick of them all— Or, when it came buzzin' like a bee through the air, Caught it cleaner, and pucked it as strong or as fair? But for all these distractions the boy wasn't spoilt, And no honest poor Irishman ever has toiled For the wife and the childer wid heartier zeal Than did Pat for his mother, good Widow O'Neale; For his father—God rest him!—had drooped down and died When the praties turned black through the whole country side; And soon after his uncle Cornelius, I've heard, From New York to his brother and sister sent word, That the passage of both he was wishful to pay, And they'd find a new home on his side of the say. So they went—wid their poor mother's blessin' and tears, Micky, twelve, but a stout little lad for his years, And Honora, the darlin' sweet child of eleven, All alone—but in safety wid the blessing of heaven. Now Widow O'Neale, the brave woman, had once For a twelvemonth been novice and lived with the nuns, Though when that was out—I've no time for the tale— She took Patrick's father, instead of the veil! Well, for nun and for novice, there's time and to spare For the needle and thread from devotion and prayer— And that time was well spent by the Colleen who now Has no cause to repent her novitiate vow; For though many's the night she's gone fastin' to bed, Little Patrick to treat to some meat or some bread, Though it's many's the beautiful sunshiny day She's sewed herself blind for his schoolin' to pay, Still an' all, sure, she managed to struggle along, Till her Patrick, now growin' up hearty and strong, Came home from the haggard one night in July, Shoutin', “Mother, mavrone, bid your needle good-bye! I'm to have a man's wages on the master's estate, And help teach at the night school—Mother, isn't it great!” So, when the spuds whitened in the gardens again Young Patrick O'Neale, now the pride of the men, Foot to foot down the ridge wid O'Flaherty pressed, Who of all pratee-diggers was counted the best; And after inspectin' the mowers at work In his glebe on the hill, Parson Fetherston Bourke, “Why, Patrick O'Neale, boy,” said he, wid a laugh, “Why, Patrick, you're worth any man and a half— For your clane, cliver coorse wid your scythe through the grass Was a picture, more power to you, Patrick, it was.” And yourselves would be pleased to have heard him at night In the master's new school-house, so smart and polite, Explainin' the earth's longitudinal plan To a wild-headed stump of a mountainy man, Or settin' a sum in Algebbra, begor, To the priest's crabbed nephew and one or two more. But when it struck ten by the clock overhead, “Good night” to the boys our young schoolmaster said; Gathered up “the Six Books” and the slates for the night, Locked the door and made off, wid a screech of delight, Through the deep mountain gloom to the darlin' red star Of his mother's turf fire winkin' welcome from far. Five minutes—no more—you allowed to that mile, Then into the cabin you'd swing through the stile, Catch and kiss the good widdy wid a wonderful smack Before she well knew that her boyo was back. Then down to the milk and the murphies you'd sit, While the dog wagged his tail and looked up for a bit, And the thief of a cat on the table sprang up, Knowin' well you could never refuse her a sup; For the proverb runs true—to my thinkin', at laste— “That man's a good man that's the friend of the baste.” Well, I've hinted that even as home through the grass Mistress Nora went trippin' direct out of Mass, Across the girl's mind there'd be sure for to steal Some notion or other of Patrick O'Neale. Now wasn't that strange, for though sweethearts for ever, Yerra! yes, though the best of the boys on The River, From the Captain commandin' the Bay wid his cutter To the proudest on shore, they were all in a flutter. Though a huckster might furnish three iligant stalls Wid the brooches and bonnets, the dresses and shawls That the cleverest courters from far and from near Had given her, galore, at each fair in the year; Though none who'd not seen it could have any iday Of the spring trout and salmon they sent her on Friday; Though they put her the question in every way out— In poems so romantic or merely by mout', In English and Irish—and as I've heard tell, One bould hedge-schoolmaster in Latin as well— And though, which you'll count the most curious of all, Not a look nor a word had he ever let fall That could lave her the laste right in raison to feel She'd put the comether on Patrick O'Neale— P'r'aps now 'twas jealousy vexed her to-day, To see Patrick funnin' wid Fanny O'Shea, Or to meet him to-morrow, the full of his cap Of purple whorts pourin' in Mary Moore's lap; While his manners to her were so courtly and grand, Holdin' out on the crops wid his hat in his hand, Or discussin' her cows wid a dignity such as A Prince of the Blood would employ to a Duchess; Or perhaps 'twas the pride, that wid Nora was high— That of all who were soft on her sorra a boy, For looks or for manners could match wid O'Neale— And yet his the one heart that the girl couldn't steal. But whativer the raison—begannies—'twas so When the county came courtin' the Colleen na Mbo, Her thoughts they kept runnin', surprisin' to say, Most of all on the man that was laste in her way. But all you sweet girls who attend to my tale, Lest by this you think coldly of Patrick O'Neale, Faith, I'm forced to confess—that when Nora believed Patrick's heart was his own, sure herself was deceived— For, of all of her suitors so rich and so high, None loved her as deep as that poor pisant boy. But why hadn't he courage his heart to declare, And to up wid his story and axe her to share His fortune for ever? I answer you, sure, “'Twas the pride that prevented him, being so poor!” Yes! that was the cause why, at bonfire or patron, When the rest all came round complimentin', and flatter'n', To her friendly “Good day,” “Good day kindly, to you!” Was your only remark to her all the dance through. And that was the raison, one night at Adair's, When after a jig—through the scarceness of chairs— The girls should sit down on the knees of the men, Till such time as the music should start up again; Each girl wid her partner and Nora wid you, You must preten' your seat wasn't equal to two, And sit down on the floor—wid her planked up behind; Though I know well which seat had been most to her mind. But when quite out of hearing, unseen and alone, To himself he'd go over each look and each tone Of Nora's he'd treasured away in his mind, At some moment she'd fretted to think him unkind; And as he went clippin' the briar wid his bill, Or rowed up the river, or reaped on the hill, Some fancy of Nora would come to him still. The arbutus fruit now, or a stretch of the sky Would recall her red lip or her laughin' blue eye, The heath flower to-day of her blushes would hint, And to-morrow the furze took her tresses' own tint— The spring leaped with her laugh over pebbles of pearl, And the sailing swan signed him his white-bosomed girl! While “Nora” for ever his oar on the bay, And “Nora” his spade in the garden used say, And “Nora” still “Nora,” to the tunes she loved best, His heart it kept beating the time in his breast. So that pair of young people their feelings used smother, Widout each thinkin' either could care for the other. But the rude blow at last will afford you a hint Of the fire that's concealed in the core of the flint; And the beautiful brim that's unnoticed by day, On the gloomiest night glitters most on the say, And so even its secretest feeling'll start In the hour of distress from the haughtiest heart. And 'twas so with these two. Now the mornin' was fair, Wid the mountains distinct from Dunloe to Kenmare. But at noon the white cloud Carn Tual had kissed, And soon after The Saw melted off in the mist; And lower, still lower the mist it crep' down, Till its curtain had covered up Atthin and Beown; And lower, still lower it swept for the plain, While you heard Bullig breaker start roarin' for rain. 'Twas a Saturday, surely, wid only the Sunday Betune it and The Fair on the following Monday. And, signs by, down each dark boreen, then, for ever, And from out every fog-steamin' ford on the river Cows and sheep they came startin', till the roads were alive, For the world like a swarm of bees smoked from a hive. Well! that very same Saturday, long before even The lark mounted up wid his matins to heaven, O'Neale had been facin', as if it was day, Surely, but sad, up the mountainy way Back out of Glen Caragh, where he'd had a call To his mother's own brother's son's funeral. Surely, but sad, you may think, at the start, Till the light of the sun began warmin' his heart; And yerra, ye'll not think the worse of the boy, If I tell you, before every dew-drop was dry, His tears for the cousin no longer used fall; And ye won't blame him much, if ye blame him at all, When I'm forced to confess that at noon upon Gloragh His thoughts they had turned round completely to Nora; Till sure an' he shocked himself singin' a song Of the Colleen na Mbo as he travelled along. So he trassed away dreamin' of Nora na Mbo, While the mist it crep' down to the valleys below, Unknownst to O'Neale; for each inch of the way He'd have travelled as surely by night as by day. Still an' all, at long last, on the edge of a bog There puffed in his face such a powderin' fog That he gave a great start and looked doubtin'ly down, To be sure he'd made off the right track to the town; And he just then could see to the left of his path, Roundin' out of the vapour, the ould Irish Rath, And says he wid a smile, “Why I might be a hound, For facin' so fair for the Barony's bound, But I'd best hurry on, then, or Mother machree, It's in dread for me out in the mist that you'll be.” So he started to run, when he heard from above The voice of the girl that had stolen his love; “Magrina, magrina, magrinashin oge, Come hither, my Laidir, come Kitty, you rogue, Come up, Blackbird, come, Snow, to the beautiful house!” “'Tis the Colleen na Mbo,” he said, “callin' her cows.” But her voice sounded sadly and strange in his ear, And the heart of O'Neale began knockin' for fear, And he looked and he saw risin' up from below, The Shadow of the Shape of the Colleen na Mbo Growin' greater for ever, till a Monster of Black, Like the Spirit of Death, it stood out of the track; And O'Neale knew the warnin', and shouted “Stand back, Stand back for your life!” but the Shadow went still, Wid its arms wavin' wild on the brow of the hill, Then it trembled, and balanced, and staggered, and fell, Down, down, wid the moan of a muffled death-bell. And as a man held by a horrible dream Wrastles hard, till at last he starts up wid a scream— So he stood there, how long himself never could tell— For the mist of a sudden seemed changed by a spell To a fierce Fiend that caught him unknownst from behind, And held him hard breathin', and his eyes startin' blind, Wid cruel white hands knotted into his neck, And a hiss in his ears like a poisonous snake— Till he wakes up at last wid a terrible groan And finds himself there on the mountain alone Wid the white mist around driftin' dreamily on. “And was it a dream, after all, then?” he cried, When a sheep-dog it ran barkin' up to his side; And the dread it returned at the voice of the dog, And he stooped down and looked at it into the fog, And he knew it was Nora's, and his heart it stood still. “Now, what are you doin', Jack, here on the hill? Where's your Nora, mavrone?” and the dog in reply Starts whinin' and draggin' away at the boy. And he knew it had answered as plain as if spoke; And says he, “Jack, I'm wid you, though my heart it is broke.” So, layin' a sorrowful hand on its head, The poor boy went after—the dumb creature led From Drumtine to Coomassig, as still as the dead. Here the dog was at fault, but soon wid a bound Followed on a fresh foot-print, his nose to the ground, And Patrick looked closer and strained through the dark, And knew it was Nora's by the straight slender mark. And he stooped down and kissed it, and Jack he stood still On the top of Coomassig and barked wid a will; And “Nora,” Pat shouted, “O, Nora na Mbo, Is it clifted you are on the mountain below! O answer, acushla.” But sorra a word But only the voice of an eagle he heard Wheelin' in through the terrible darkness beneath, And he shuddered and sobbed, “It comes scentin' her death, And not as much light as to stone it away, O, God, that the darkness would turn into day!” “Come, Jack, we'll go down to the foot of the rock And protect the poor corpse from the ravenous flock,” And he coaxed him to come, but the dog wouldn't stir, So alone down the cliff Pat went searching for her; But as he was going, a far hullahoo Rose out of the distance, and into his view Red torches came wavin' their way up the hill, And he laughed a wild laugh through his wanderin' will, And he cried: “Is it wake-lights yez are drawin' near? Hurry up, then, and show me the corpse of my dear.” And the red lights approached, and a voice wid the light, “Who are ye in distress on the mountain to-night?” And he answered: “Come up, for our name it is Death, Wid the eagle above and the white worm beneath; But the death-lights that hover by night o'er the grave Will restore us our dead when your torches can save.” “What is it, O'Neale, man? How wildly you rave,” And the hand of Murt Shea, the best friend that he had, Was lovingly laid on the arm of the lad. “O, Murt, give me hould of that splinter,” he said, “And let me look down on the face of the dead, For Nora Maguire, Murt, my own secret love, Has fallen from the clift of Coomassig above.” “Is it she, wirra, wirra! the pride of us all? Do you say that the darlin's been killed by a fall? Ologone, my poor Pat, and you loved her at heart.” Then O'Neale groaned again, “Sure I've searched every part, And no sign of her here at the foot of the clift.” And the rest they came up, and the bushes they sift, But sorra a trace to the right or the left. Then O'Neale shouted, “Come, every man of ye lift His fire altogether.” And one said, “I see Somethin' hangin' up high from the juniper tree.” “'Tis herself,” shouted Pat, wid his hand to his brow, “How far from the top is that juniper bough?” “Ten foot of a fall,” said a mountain gossoon, “Wid no tussocks betune them?” “Wid nothin' betune.” “Have yez e'er a rope handy, boys?” “Divle a rope! And not nearer nor Sneem for the likes you could hope.” “Come hither, gossoon, and be off wid this splinter, For 'tis you know the mountain; away widout hinder To the nearest good haggard, and strip the sugane, Not forgettin' a sop of the freshest finane. Brustig, brustig, alanah!” and hardly the rest Had followed O'Neale up the vapoury crest, To the spot that the faithful, wise hound wouldn't pass, When the boy he was back wid the hayropes and grass. Then, says Pat, leanin' down wid a splinter of light, “God bless the good dog—after all he was right. Ten foot underneath us—she's plainly in sight. Now give hither the ropes, and hould on while I twist.” So he caught the suganes up like threads in his fist, And twined them and jined them a thirty foot length, Four plait to a thickness of terrible strength, Then roped it around the two biggest boys there, To see was it fit for supportin' a pair. And he easily lifted the two through the air, Up and down, till he'd proved it well able to bear. “Now make the rope fast to me, boys, while I go Down the side of the clift for the Colleen na Mbo. Livin' or dead; yet I'm hopeful, for all, There's life in her still, tho' she's kilt from the fall.” Then he turns to one side, and he whispers Murt Shea, “If I'm killed from the clift of Coomassig to-day, Come promise me faithful you'll stand to the mother Like a son, till she's help from the sister and brother. And give her this kiss, and I'll meet her again In the place where's no poverty, sorrow or pain.” And he promised—and all they shook hands wid O'Neale, And he cheered them, and said, “Have no dread that we'll fail, For I'd not be afeard, why, to balance the Pope Himself from the clift by so hearty a rope.” So a torch in his hand, and a stick in his teeth, And his coat round his throat, the boys lowered him beneath. And all but Murt Shea, then, they couldn't make out The coat round his throat, and the stick in his mout'. But it wasn't for long they'd the doubt in their mind, For they saw his torch quenched wid a noise like the wind, And “steady above!” came his voice from below, Then heavy wings flapped wid a scream and a blow. “'Tis the eagles” they cried, “at the Colleen na Mbo.” But an old man amongst them spoke up, and he said, “'Tis the eagles for sartin, but not at the dead, For they'll not touch the corpse—murther, but for the mist, 'Tis I could have told you that this was their nest. It's O'Neale that they're at—pull him back, or they'll tear The poor boy to pieces below in the air.” And they shouted together the eagles to scare, And they called to O'Neale from the edge of the height: “She's dead, Pat, she's dead, never mind her to-night, But come back, or the eagles 'll pick out your sight.” And they made for to pull; but he cries, “If you do I give you my oath that I'll cut the rope through.” And they b'lieved him, and waited wid hearts beatin' loud, Screechin' down at the birds through the vapoury cloud, Showerin' splinters for ever to give the boy light, And warnin' him watch to the left or the right, As each eagle in turn it would fly at his head! Till he dropped one below in the darkness for dead, And the other flew off wid a yell through the night. Then they felt the rope slacken as he crossed to the bough, Then tighten again—and he called to them “Now!” And they knew that the dangerous moment was come. So wid wrist draggin' shoulder, tight finger to thumb, And tooth crushing tooth in the silence of death, They drew up the two from the blackness beneath. There'd been a long stretch of delightful spring weather But this was the day beat the rest altogether, Over mountain and valley and river—Oyeh! There was never for ever so darlin' a day— Wid its purty, pale primroses shrinkin' so shy From the bachelor butterfly's kiss-and-go-by, And wid hawthorns, like bridesmaids come out in the air, Arrangin' white wreaths in their iligant hair. And so thought a fiddler, fiddle on back, Steppin' for town by the mountainy track. “But,” says he, “what's the raison the people are dressed, All wid shoes on their feet, in their holiday best? Tisn't Sunday, then—barrin' the priests were astray, Ere yesterday mornin' off out at Rossbeigh; And a Saint's Day it's not, for I know them by heart, The whole box an' dice they observe in this part. Must be, then, begorra, I make no mistake, In concludin' it's either a weddin' or wake; Though I shouldn't have thought the worst omadhaun round 'D have chosen such weather for goin' underground.” When who should come hurryin' down the boreen But Honor O'Connor dressed out like a queen, Wid her hair in one wonderful plait, and upon it— Like the bird on its nest—a sweet bit of a bonnet— And a green sash that showed her fine figure for'nint, And, flouncin' behind her, the beautif'liest print Folded into her hand, just enough for a hint Of as tidy an ankle as ever set step. So the girl she came on, wid the laugh on her lip, Till she sighted the fiddler, and “Shiel, dear,” said she; (For I should have remarked that the fiddler was me) “What a stranger you are—tho' returnin' aright, For we've terrible want of your fiddle to-night;” “But what wonderful doin's are goin' on below, Honor, acora?” “Ah! nonsense! You know, Why Nora Maguire's to be married to-day.” “Glory be to God!—Is it true what you say? Well, Nora na Mbo, but I'm wishin' you joy; And who in the name of good fortune's the boy?” “Arrah who should it be, then, but Mr. O'Neale? But you're bothered, I see.” So she up wid the tale Of the Colleen na Mbo that I've told to yez all, Explainin' how Nora wasn't kilt by the fall, Though she took the brain fever immediate on that— And how she wint ravin' for ever on Pat, And her love, and the pity the boy was so poor— And how hopeful from this of performing her cure, Good Dr. O'Kydd, ere the crisis came on, Goes off to consider wid ould Father John— And how the two wint wid one mind to the Squire To tell him the danger of Nora Maguire; And the master, said he, “I've my eye on the lad, And I want a sub-agent. He'll suit me bedad— I'll send for him up to the Castle to-day.” And he got no refusal from Pat, you may say. And how the good doctor told Nora the night When the crisis was on her—by accident quite— About Patrick. Then how a great longin' for life, And maybe the notion she'd yet be his wife Came over the girl—and the terrible flood Of the fever subsided away from her blood; And tho' yerrah so wasted—to see her you'd cry— In a month she was up, and, av coorse, Patrick by; And concludin' how hardly the winter was out, When thro' all of Dunkerron 'twas rumoured about, Norah'd taken O'Neale, and there wasn't a doubt When the good priest he published them three weeks ago, And to-day they'll be married in the Chapel below. Then the marriage-bell started as Honor and I Stepped into the town wid our hearts full of joy; So off we two darted, and just at the porch Met Nora, the darlin', drivin' up to the Church, And Pat, you may guess, wasn't long in the lurch. And a power of company surely were there, Of the highest and lowest all down from Kenmare, For the Squire and the quality seated around Side by side wid the lowliest pisant you found. And the whole string of sweethearts who'd courted in vain (For not a man of them would give Nora pain By seemin' heartbroken or wishful to slight Her choice of O'Neale) had agreed to unite To see the girl's weddin'—and surely for this too, Whin ould Father John had them married and blessed too, They each had her thanks—Yerra yes! and a kiss too. And somehow myself was mixed up wid that lot, And stole the best kiss that I ever yet got. “Arrah! Shiel, is it you? Why, none of us knew Yourself was a sweetheart of Nora here, too” “Was it Shiel, why, that kissed me?” “'Twas so then, bedad; Hould his hands for me, Murphy,” “Now would you, my lad?” “Mercy, Nora, and whisper! 'Twas just in advance That I took it—for playin' to-night at your dance.” “Areesh! Shiel O'Farrell! more power to your tongue! Your tale was well told, as your songs are well sung. And ‘The Colleen na Mbo’ would provide a prime play For the New Irish Theatre over the way, If you'd cast it to suit them.” “Indeed, so I may, But who'd furnish my eagles?” “Your eagles?” “Yes! who?” “The Head Keeper, why not? of the Phœnix Park Zoo 'Twould take careful rehearsal to perfect them, p'r'aps, But I'd not put it past some stage-managing chaps.” “And if the Park breed were too wicked or wild?” “There's the æroplane sort which I'd trust with a child. And they tell me that one of our Branch, by name Nagle, Scares the birds from his crops with an ‘æroplane aigle.’ When the harvest is over, he'll hire it you, certain!” “Will you whisht with your codding now, Councillor Curtain! And since our talk's took such a frivolous turn, I'll call upon Parson George Hannay O'Byrne To steady us down with an old world romance!” Well! the Parson looked up with a comical glance, And lifted his gold-mounted specs from his brow, With “An Creeveen, at once to your wishes I how, And this old Tale of Truth, I may say at the start, Is concerned with the forebears of Mr. McArt.” THE FAIRY BRANCH It chanced upon a time, a magic time, That Cormac, son of Art, arch-king of Erin, Strode, musing, from his dun in Liathdrum When lo! a noble youth upon the green, And in his hand a glittering fairy branch With nine bright apples of red gold thereon. This was, indeed, the wonder-working bough, That whoso shook, men wounded unto death And women travail-tortured sank to sleep, Soothed by the low, delicious lullaby Those golden apples uttered. Nay, no want, No woe, no weariness endures on earth That swiftly stabs or slowly wastes the soul, But this sweet branch, once shaken, wholly hides In soft oblivion. Therefore, spake the king, “Declare thy coming! Is that branch thine own?” “Yea, Sire,” the youth replied. “Would'st part with it?” “Aye truly would I, so I won its worth.” “What is the price thou askest?” “The award Of mine own mouth.” “'Tis thine, yet name it me.” “Then, king, I claim thy wife, thy son, thy daughter, Chaste Eithne, gallant Cairbre, winsome Ailbhe.” “Great was the price upon thy fairy branch; Yet, for I pledged to thee thy mouth's award, I fain must grant it all.” Therewith the youth Resigned the magic bough to Cormac's care, And this the monarch bore within his dun To Eithne, and to Cairbre, and to Ailbhe. “A beauteous treasure hast thou brought us, father,” Cried Ailbhe straight. “Small wonder,” sighed the king, “Seeing it cost so dear.” “What gave you for it?” “Thy brother, mother, and thyself, O Ailbhe.” “That price were piteous, if thy words be true,” Said Eithne; “for we trust that all the earth Contains no treasure thou would'st change us for.” “Alas! I plight you all my kingly word That I have given you for this Fairy Bough,” King Cormac answered weeping, and declared The coming of the Bearer of the Branch. Now when they proved the bitter tidings true, Queen Eithne searched the sorrow-smitten face Of Cormac, and for pity held her peace; And Cairbre took her hand in his and spake not; But Ailbhe snatched a gleaming knife, and shore Close to her head her bright, abundant hair, With “Father, often hast thou called these curls Thy golden-branching joy—thus, thus they fall Before the branch of gold that masters them.” Then dark distress obscured the eyes of all, And broke in bitter rain upon their cheeks, And choked the cheerful family of words With grievous sighs and great heart-bursting groans, Till Cormac caught the wonder-working bough And shook it softly o'er them, and forthwith, Soothed by the low, delicious lullaby Those golden apples uttered, they forgot What ill had happ'd them, and arose and went With smiles to meet the Bearer of the Branch; Howbeit with tears King Cormac strode before. When, lo, the youth! Then Cormac: “See thy price, The heavy price I pledged thee for this branch.” “Well hast thou kept thy promise; wherefore take A blessing for thy truth's sake; aye, a blessing Shall win thee victory.” Thus they went their way— The youth and his companions glad at heart: The other wifeless, childless, full of woe. Now on the morrow, when that mournful news Was noised abroad through Erin, loud laments Arose from all the land, but in Teamhair The loudest, from the princes round the throne To lowliest labourer in the royal fields; So dear beloved was Eithne for her wealth Of queenly wit and wisdom—dearer still For constant deeds of thoughtfullest charity; So dear beloved was Cairbre for his might Of manly youth, not lightly roused to wrath, Yet swift and sure to succour the oppressed; So dear beloved was Ailbhe for her dower Of artless beauty and her voice of song, That held the blackbirds hushed in Derrycarn. These, therefore, all the land with many tears Bewailing wept; and tho' their monarch yearned To share with them his sorrow, ne'ertheless In pity for his people, once again He raised the fairy branch of glittering gold And shook it in their midst, and so subdued Their grief with glamour till they smiled again. Yet Cormac's grief possessed him more and more, Seeing he mourned alone; and though in court He ever kept a seeming cheerful face, Nor lived less instant in his daily round Of royal duty: yet the thoughtful days Of law and chess and judgment lightest lay Upon his suffering spirit. Heavily went The weekly wassail; sadly shone the dawns Of race and chase, tho' bright to all beside. But darkest gloomed the long, lone day of love; For then within his palace, without food, He mused, a mournful man; or wandering From chamber on to chamber, smote His bosom at the silent spinning wheel, The stringless harp, or touched with trembling hand The empty torque of gold, the empty fails That last had clasped the lovely neck and arms, The round white neck and snowy dimpled arms Of Eithne; or with heavy foot awoke A groan from Cairbre's armour on the wall— A groan his sonless heart gave deeply back; Or in the distance heard some damsel singing A favourite song of Ailbhe's and drew forth Her golden hair and bathed it in his tears. At last the king's high-ollamh thus began: “O Cormac, son of Art and son of Conn The hundred-battled, let our souls declare What long hath lain a burthen on our peace. We see thee seeming cheerful on the days Of weekly wassail, chess, and race and chase, Yet to the careful eye concealing grief: We mark thee on the morns of law and judgment Discreetly question and deliberate weave Thy ordered thoughts in well-knit weighty speech, Yet miss thee, as of old, on thy discourses Broidering the opal flowers of eloquence, Or flashing through them, to the listener's joy, The diamond ray of reason-dazzling wit. Nay, when that suitor seeking penalty Exceeding great for satire on himself So bitter true, that when big-bellied, bald With blunder-breeding tongue, he raging rose Before the Brehon who rehearsed the rann, A shout of long, side-shaking laughter broke From all the young at once, till here and there Flashing a furious glance, the satirised Retreated with his paunch toward thee, king, Yet careless of his trailing scabbard, tripped, And backward staggering with blind hands in air Caught the chief cook by his long, foxy beard Behind the door, and fistful of red hair Plumped howling on the pavement. Then ourselves, The elders, might no more restrain the mirth That swelled our cheeks to bursting. Out it blew In bass so brazen or such bleating treble All laughed the louder save thyself alone, Only one smile, one faintly flickering smile Of dim December sunshine lit thy lips. Now in the name of all thy loving people, Princes and Lords and Commons, I am come Beseeching thee that I may take the Branch And shake it o'er thy head and so subdue Thy grief with glamour, that the memory Of all thine evil loss may from thy mind Fade utterly, and again thou may'st arise And take to wife the fairest, purest Princess Wide-bordered Erin boasts, and sow anew Seed-royal that shall richly around thee rise— Thy manhood's hope, thy flowering fence of age.” Yet Cormac yielded not his people's prayer, But root-fast in his barren grief endured, Until the leaden pacing year revolved To the dark day that left him desolate. Then he arose and thrust the Fairy Branch Into his bosom and went forth alone To that sad region where his Three had left him; When straight a magic mist gathered and gloomed, Nor melted, till there smote upon his ear The sound of manly voices sweetly singing To harp and tympan touched with tuneful skill. And look, a noble company of youths With five slain harts and fifty wearied hounds Beneath a mighty hunting-booth carousing Upon the mountain. These with gracious greeting Rising received him, and their chief approached, And in an hospitable hand took his, And led him to the seat of utmost honour Beside him, and besought him to partake Their banquet, ever host-like urging him To each its choicest dainties. But the soul Of Cormac craved no meats, tho' much he praised them, And ever guest-like feigned an unfelt hunger: Yet as they spake and jested, and sang and harped, Scarce tasting food, he quaffed the circling cup, Red with the grape and sweet with heather honey, Until his heart grew merry and he forgot The Fairy Branch; then swift his host put forth A secret hand to where it shook and sparkled Within his bosom, when lo! the three gold apples That hung the lowest of the nine rang forth A tuneless warning, and the monarch caught The robber's wrist, and wrung the bough therefrom, And shook it o'er him and his company, And forthwith they fell grovelling to the ground In the similitude of filthy swine; And Cormac knew that he had scarce escaped The Cup of Cursing, that of the face of man Stamped with God's image makes a bestial front, And of the mouth, wherefrom His prayer and praise Should chiefly flow—a monster's ravening maw. Again a mist of magic gathering gloomed Around the king, nor passed from off his path Until the moon of harvest thrilled it through With golden glimmering glory, and he was 'ware Of one apparelled as a princess, crouched Wild weeping on the earth, her reckless hands Rending her radiant hair. And Cormac's heart Was melted, and he asked her of her grief. Then with bowed head she poured a lamentation Of her young lover fallen in fight. And Cormac met her woe with words of solace And she took comfort and turned to him a face Whiter than any swan upon the wave— A form of fairer fashion. Then the king Looked closelier at her, and with wonder viewed Her yellow curls, clustering like rings of gold Around her waist, and marked her tearful eyes Dart through their dusky fringes a dewy beam Bluer than ever evening's weeping star Shed through the curtain of a summer's cloud: When suddenly she opened them full on him With wistful gaze, and as she looked a blush Took her pale visage, while her slender hand Stole throbbing into his. A mighty spell Possessed his soul, and nearer still and nearer He drew her, till he breathed her red lips' balm And passionately had pressed them to his own— When lo! the midmost row of apples rang The warning of the Branch, and in his breast He caught the woman's thievish hand upon it, And wrung it from her grasp, and o'er her head Shook it, and of a sudden her soft white palm Shrivelled, her lovely apple blossom cheeks Withered away, her eyes of heavenly blue Grew blear and evil, all her swan-like shape Dwindled and shrank; till at the last there writhed Whining before him a little crook-back witch. Once more the magic mist obscured his course, Nor passed until the sun, with purple beam Piercing its cloud, displayed a goodly group Of sages seated, all with eager speech In such dispute, none knew or seemed to know Cormac had joined him to their company, Until an end was made to their discourse Sophistical of Love and Life and Death. Then with a courteous welcome they inquired His mind upon their thoughts, and led him on, Lauding his judgment, gravely to propound And keenly argue; till at last he grew So soul-enamoured of their sophistries That when the sage in chief with flattering tongue Besought him bide with them continually— Such need, such heavy need, had they of one In wit so shrewd, in eloquence so lofty— He fain had fared with them, but ere he spoke The young Branch-bearer's words came back to him: “Well hast thou kept thy promise; wherefore take A blessing for thy truth's sake—aye, a blessing Shall win thee victory,” while a tuneless peal Rang from the topmost row of golden apples Upon the fairy bough, and Cormac caught The elder's thievish hand within his bosom Upon the branch, and wrung it fiercely from him, And shook it o'er him and his sophist crew; And lo! they vanished gibbering before him, A grinning troop of fleshless skeletons. Again the King of Erin went his ways, Nor now had been long journeying, when there stretched An hundred-acred field before him, bright With stooks of golden corn; three spear-casts further, Crowning a sudden, green, far-looking mound, A mansion, many windowed, sunset-flattered To topaz, ruby, amethyst, shone and sparkled A thousand welcomes, while; behind, a forest Laughed back all emerald. Through the field of corn He swiftly strode, with noble heart presaging His goal at last, and climbed the hill and sought The mansion, took the hand-log in his hand And boldly knocked. Immediate to the wall The door sprang open of its own accord, While from within a mighty summons came, “In God's name enter!” Straight he entered in, Following the voice, and reached a royal hall, Huge, black-oak-raftered, silver-pillared, hung Its circuit through with brightly burnished arms, Elk-antlers, giant boar-tusks, jewelled breakers— By seven great archways pierced, with couches seven, Silk canopied, yew-carven, fine-fur-covered Betwixt each twain; a royal champion's seat Of beaten gold before its blazing hearth, And on the seat a princely chieftain, clad In many-coloured raiment, at his side A bright apparelled Princess. These arose At Cormac's coming, and bespake him thus: “Whoe'r thou art, oh! stranger, 'tis no hour To further fare on foot, seeing the sun Is well-nigh set; then sit thee down with us And share our banquet, and abide the night Beneath our roof, till rosy morn return.” Then Cormac, son of Art, sat gladly down. “Go forth now to the grove,” the woman cried, “Oh! goodman of the house; thy spear in hand, For lo! there lacks sufficiency of meat To sate our want.” Therewith the chief arose, His hunting spear in hand, and fared abroad; Nor tarried long without but soon returned A great wood-ranging, acorn-crushing boar, Fresh skinned and cleaned and quartered, on his back, And in his hand a mighty log of pine; And cast them down before the fire; and thus To Cormac and the Princess smiling spake: “There have ye meat, now cook it for yourselves!” “After what manner?” asked the son of Art. “That I will teach thee,” saith his host; “Arise And make four quarters of this log of pine, Then lay a quarter log upon the fire, And o'er it one full quarter of the boar, And tell a tale of truth, however short, Above it, and that quarter shall be roast.” Then Cormac rose and caught a glittering axe, And proved it keen and true, and eyed the wood, And stepping backwards swung the biting steel Once from his shoulder, and the great log fell Clean cleft in twain; twice, thrice, and smote in half Each equal portion. Next the woman laid A quarter faggot on the leaping fire, And o'er it one full quarter of the swine. Then Cormac spake: “Since each hath borne his part, 'Twere ill-befitting that the one, a guest, Should further tell a tale of truth for two— His host and hostess.” “Right thou art forsooth,” The Prince replied “And now methinks thy speech, Matched with thy noble mien, bewrays thee royal; Therefore my story first. That boar is one Of seven, yet could I feed the world with them; For I have but to take his bones abroad, And bury them beneath a sacred tree, And, look, the sod begins to sway and surge, Till sudden, from his scarce dug sepulchre, The monstrous beast breaks bellowing away.” That tale was true; and lo! the flesh was roast. “Tell now thy tale, fair princess,” saith the king. “I will,” quoth she, “but do thou first lay down Thy quarter log upon the leaping fire, And o'er it one full quarter of the boar.” So it was done. “Seven cows are mine,” saith she, “Snow white from horn to hoof, and not a day Dawns or declines but these with matchless milk Fill seven full kieves, and here's my hand to you, My kine could milk enough to satisfy The souls of all the sons of earth assembled Athirst on yonder plain.” That tale was true. And lo! her quarter of the boar was roast. Then Cormac: “If thy tale be true indeed Thy husband there is Mananan, thyself His wedded wife; for on the face of earth Exists there not the owner of such treasures, Save Mananan alone, for to Tir Tairrngire He went to seek thy hand and won it well, And therewithal to dower these wondrous cows, And coughed upon them till he quite constrained Their udders to his will.” “Full wisely now Hast thou divined us both!” cried Mananan. “But tell a story for thy quarter now.” “Ay! sure,” saith Cormac, “yet do thou lay down Thy faggot now upon the leaping fire, And over it thy quarter of the swine.” So it was done, and thus the king outspake: “I come, indeed, upon an anxious quest, For 'tis a year to-day my wife and son And daughter, three most dear on earth to me, Were borne afar.” “By whom?” asked Mananan. “A youth,” the King replied, “there came to me, Bearing a golden branch, for which my heart Conceived so deep desire, I granted him The full award of his own mouth for it, The which he thus pronounced against my peace: ‘Therefore, I claim thy wife, thy son, thy daughter— Chaste Eithne, gallant Cairbre, winsome Ailbhe.’” “If what thou sayest be true,” cried Mananan, “Thyself art Cormac, son of Art, the son Of hundred-battled Conn.” “That same am I,” Quoth Cormac, “and in quest of these I come.” That tale was true, and lo! his quarter roast. “Eat now thy meat,” bespake him Mananan. “I never yet broke bread,” the king replied, “Having two only in my company.” “Would'st thou consume it with three more, O Cormac?” “Yea, good mine host, were they but dear to me.” Then Mananan arose and oped the door, The farthest from his hearth, and straight led in Chaste Eithne, gallant Cairbre, winsome Ailbhe; And these in utter rapture around him clinging The king embraced with tears and sobs of joy. Thereafter Cormac and his Queen and Children Sat down to meat, and on the festal board A table-cloth of snowy silk was spread. “'Tis a full precious thing thou seest before thee, O Cormac, son of Art,” saith Mananan; “For never yet was food so delicate But thrice demanded of this charméd cloth Straight stands thereon.” “Nay, that indeed is well,” Quoth Cormac. Then the other smiling thrust His hand into his girdle and drew forth A golden cup and set it on his palm. “A magic marvel is this cup of mine, Seeing no drink can be desired therefrom, But look, the same leaps bubbling to its brim!” “That too is well, O Mananan!” “Moreover, 'Tis of the virtues of this magic cup That when a lying tale is told before it, Lo! it lies broken. Tell a tale of truth, And on the instant it is whole again.” “Let that be proved, O Mananan!” “Then give ear, O Cormac! This thy wife I bore from thee In sooth hath had another husband since.” Therewith in pieces lay the fairy cup. “A lying tale!” his princess answered him; “Nor man nor woman hath she seen, save us And these her children dear.” That tale was true, And straight the fairy cup was whole again. “Priceless possessions verily are these, O Mananan,” saith Cormac. “Thine henceforth, Two precious tokens, Cormac, of my friendship— To wit, the Charméd Cloth and Magic Cup; The Fairy Branch, moreover, treasure still. And now the banquet waits us, and believe That hadst thou here an host in multitude Not one should miss of hospitable cheer; And in this cup I pledge thee, for I searched Thine inmost soul with spells, that thou and these Might share this joyful feast of fellowship.” Thereafterward they supped right royally; For not a meat they thought on but that cloth Forthwith displayed, nor any drink desired But straight it sparkled in that magic cup. And for that fairy feast to Mananan The four gave thanks exceeding, and arose And bade their hosts good night, and laid them down On kingly couches richly strewn for them, And swiftly fell on slumber and sweet sleep; And where they woke upon the morrow morn Was in their pleasant palace Liathdrum. “Bravo! Parson. But where did you raise your variety Of that Text of the Old Ossianic Society?” “That's my secret, O'Hea, my Paul Pry of the Press. But, An Creeveen, your ear!” “Was it he, now?” “No less!” Then O'Leary laughed out: “Let me try and translate In a rann the thoughts running through Pat O'Hea's pate. “My Paul Pry of the Press! Well, for that I'll your locks comb, In ‘The Comet,’ my ecclesiastical Coxcomb!” Cried an Creeveen: “O'Leary, don't meddle or mix, Or conceive you can set two such friends at cross sticks! What odds where the Parson procured his True Tale, 'Tis a genuine growth from the heart of the Gael, With old roughnesses smoothed, but not polished away— Tennysonian somewhat in parts, I would say; Yet that great Wizard's spell, when our young poets shape Hero tales in blank verse, who can wholly escape? Well! McArt's Orpheus Story was out and out tragic, And the other two Tales both escaped grief by magic; But, before our Grand Shenachus Evening is done, Can't we have just one screed full of frolicking fun?” “Aye! aye!” we all answered, with shouts for Dick Dunn; And Dick, the best playboy in old Dublin City, Cried, “Hark, then, this dog'rel, no! Pig-erel Ditty! Which I caught up in Kerry, a year or more back, Beside Derryquin from one old Dr. Mack.” THE FAIRY PIG Years ago Connor Glanny, The honest poor man, he Felt the bitter distress, You may easily guess, Whin I tell you he'd lost All his fruit from the frost (An' his apples the way His rint he used pay); An' his young wife confined An' still on his mind; An' their first little son The weakliest one; An' so, you may say, The sight of that orchard The little man tortured, Wid sorra a pippin Smilin' off of its kippin To meet Quarter-day. Well! the night barrin' two That the rint it was due, He up and away, Before it was dawn, To his cousin Jer Shea, Beyant Derrynane, To see could he borrow The money agin That day after to-morrow; But Jer wasn't in, But across at Eyries Wid a boat-load of trees; So Glanny turned back By the mountainy track, An' the head hangin' down, Was trassin' for town; Whin he chanced in Bunow, On a small little sow, On the naked rock lyin', An' jist about dyin.' It was awful hot weather, An' Glanny was bate, An' to Sneem altogether Was six mile complate; Still an' all for that same, For the baste has its claim On the honest man's mind; “I'll not lave you behind,” Says he, “in the sun, On that scorchin' hot shelf, Or to bacon itself You'll shortly be done.” So off of the rock, The two arms around her, That bonneen he took, An' faith an' he found her A good weighty block, An' was right glad to ground her In the shade of the hedge At the dusty road's edge. Then, says he, “Faix I think I'll bring you a drink, You poor little baste, You'd die softer at laste.” So back to a fountain Where himself had just been, He stretched up the mountain For that little bonneen, As if 'twas his daughter, An' filled his caubeen Full up wid spring wather, Thin turned slowly back Like a snail on his track, For fear he'd be spillin' The drink if he ran, Though the heat it was killin To a bareheaded man. Thin the sow for that sup Lookin' thankfully up, Now, what do you think? Before you could wink, Sucked it down in one drink, Gave herself a good rowl, An' thin, on my sowl! Starts up, why, as frisky As if she'd had whisky, Racin' an' chasin' Her tail wid her snout, In a style so amazin' Aroun' an' about, That though Glanny felt sure An' surer each minute There was something quare in it Performin' her cure, He should still folly afther That bonneen so droll, His sides splittin' wid laughter At each caracole. So the sow held her path To an ould Irish rath, Thin roundin' about, Wid a shake of her snout Signin' where she was goin', She made off for an owen, Gladiatoring her way, Wid her tail in the air, Through such briars and furze, As a fool, why, would say, In five minutes 'd flay her Wid that soft skin of hers, Or prickle the baste To a hedgehog at laste. “Hould on,” Glanny shouted, “Or by that holly tree Suicided you'll be,” And made for to catch her. But through it she snouted Wid sorra a scratch, sure, Just as if it was wool She was giving a pull; An' Glanny should folly The pig, av ye plaze, Right in through that holly On his hands an' his knees, Till she came to a cave, Flagged above wid gallauns, And the ould Ogham Crève On the edge of the stones; As he saw, whin his sight Understood the dim light Of that hole underground. But no symptom around, Left, centre, or right, Of the little bonneen That had guided him in. Till liftin' his eyes, He sees wid surprise Herself by the curl Of her comical tail Swingin' down from the roof In a wonderful whirl. Well! to have a sure proof The appearance was raal, Glanny grips her forenint; Whin widout the laste hint Of so awful a wonder, Through the thick of a storm Of terrible thunder, By lightnin' Most fright'nin' He sees her transform, Transform, an' transform; Till a beautiful fairy, Complete in her charms, Wid a laugh, O how merry! She leapt from his arms To the moss, that the minute She set her foot in it Turned to velvet—no less— Of a green like her dress. While sofies and chairs, An' harps and pianees, Promenadin' in pairs, Took their places, begannies, As if walked to their stands By invisible hands. Thin goold plate an' cup Came galloping up, The purtiest of papers Spread the four walls, be japers, An' a crimson silk curtain Crowned a chamber for sartin— At laste I'd presume, Widout any bravado— Batin' out the drawing-room Of the Jap'nese Mikado. An' as you bewilder Ourselves an' the childer Up in London wid your Prestidigitateur And his droll conjuration, That was just Glanny's station— Cryin' out at each wonder, As if at a show, “O vo! O vo!” “O thunder, O thunder!” “O glory be to God! “By my sowl, but that's odd!” Till immediately after Some such star-gazin' speech, There arose such a screech Of shrill little laughter, That he faced sudden round, An', begorra, there found A whole fairy squadroon, Ivery single small one Its sides splittin' wid fun— Wid the former bonneen In front for their Queen; Who, beckn'in for silence, “Pray pardon their vi'lence, Mr. Connor,” says she, “For really my elves “Will be makin' too free “Sometimes wid themselves— “Will ye whisht, all of ye!” Thin she whispers to Glanny, “In the whole of this part “There never was any “As gentle at heart “As you, “Aroo. “Signs by—and because “'Tis enchanted I was, “Away up in Bunow, “In the form of a sow, “A small little sow, “On the scorchin' rock lyin', “An' just about dyin' “Of the drought, you may say; “For each one hottest day “Through the last fifty year— “Wid not one to appear, “To or out of the city, “To show any pity “To the little bonneen,— “For that spell shouldn't cease, “'Till one came to release “By liftin' me down “To the road from the town, “And climbin' the hill “His caubeen for to fill “Full up wid spring wather “For me, “Machree, “As if for his daughter; “Till, Glanny, you came, “And accomplished that same— “An' I'm free to my joy “Through the manes of you, boy! “Now what can I do “To ricompinse you? “Any wish that you have “I'll give, as you gave; “Name it, “An' claim it “From me,” Says she; “With no ‘by your lave,’ or “Condition, or favour— “I'll grant it, machree.” “Thank you kindly,” says he, “But I think you'll agree “You never could grant “All the wishes I want, “Whin I tell you I've come “From the sorrafullest home. “The young wife confined, “An' still on my mind, “An' the small little son, “The sickliest one, “An' my apples all lost “By the cruelest frost. “An' my fruit the one way “The rint I can pay— “An' it due, to my sorrow, “The day afther to-morrow.” Says she, “Then cheer up, “An' I'll manage it all— “But its fastin' you look “For the bit and the sup; “So”—she here gave a call To her fairy French cook— “You'll stay here, an' dine “On my mate and my wine; “Then you'll feel more the man “To consider my plan.” Thin a table arose Wid a cloth like the snows, And upon it goold dishes Full of soups and of fishes. And mates and sweetmates Hot an' cowld on the plates. An' a soft pair of sates. So she, why, and Connor To that dinner sat down, While, glory! on my honor! Aroun' an' aroun' Wine and Guinness's stout Kept pourin' itself out; An' the beautiful pratee, Burstin' out of its jacket In the height of its gai'ty, Bounced up—O! and crack it, Melted off in the mout'— So soft and delicious— An' delightful side dishes, Fish and fowl, they came skelpin', An' mutton and pork, Presentin' a helpin' To each knife and each fork; Till, of all on the table Glanny Connor was able To manage no more. Then, says she, “Now, astore, “I won't lend you the goold, “For we both might be fooled “By its changing itself, “Whin stored up on your shelf, “To dock-leaves or grass— “As is often the case. “But I've got a surprise “Will gladden your eyes “When you're back at your home. “But come, Glanny, come; “Since so plainly you show “Your impatience to go, “Tharram pogue! an' good-bye,” “An' gives him a kiss. Says Glanny, “Why, why, “What's the manin' of this? “O thunder, O thunder! “What's this that I'm under?” “Your orchard,” so sweet, It seemed for to say, Then below at his feet Died far, far away. 'Twas the set of the day, And the sun's last ray Showed him each leafy Spray was heavy Wid a smilin' store Of apples galore— O just the way, For the world, like a bevy Of girls in a play Of hide an' seek, Whom you find at last, after searchin' all day, Wid the laugh on the lip and the smile on the cheek. So each purty pippin Curtsey'd off of its kippin' Bright and blushin' All over the tree. And hark! see! Who comes hushin', Brave and rosy As the rest— Wid a shoheen, ho! so sweet and cosy— A hearty child upon her breast? Upon my life! 'Tis Glanny's wife, An' Glanny's boy, O joy! O joy! Long and loud we applauded, then closed The Branch down, And with friendly farewells scattered into the town.”</field>

Chorus Here's a health to you, Father O'Flynn, Slainté, and slainté, and slainté agin; Powerfullest preacher, and Tinderest teacher, and Kindliest creature in ould Donegal. Don't talk of your Provost and Fellows of Trinity, Famous for ever at Greek and Latinity, Dad and the divels and all at Divinity, Father O'Flynn 'd make hares of them all. Come, I vinture to give you my word, Never the likes of his logic was heard, Down from Mythology Into Thayology, Troth! and Conchology, if he'd the call. Chorus Here's a health to you, Father O'Flynn, Slainté and slainté, and slainté agin; Powerfullest preacher, and Tinderest teacher, and Kindliest creature in ould Donegal. Och!

O'FARRELL, THE FIDDLER Now, thin, what has become Of Thady O'Farrell? The honest poor man, What's delayin' him, why? O, the thrush should be dumb, And the lark cease to carol, Whin his music began To comether the sky. Three summers have gone Since we've missed you, O'Farrell From the weddin' and patron And fair on the green. In an hour to St. John We'll light up the tar-barrel, But ourselves we're not flatter'n' That thin you'll be seen. O, Thady, we've watched And we've waited for ever To see your ould self Steppin' into the town— Wid your corduroys patched So clane and so clever, And the pride of a Guelph In your smile or your frown— Till some one used say, “Here's Thady O'Farrell;” And “God bless the good man! Let's go meet him,” we cried; And wid this from their play, And wid that from their quarrel, All the little ones ran To be first at your side. Soon amongst us you'd stand, Wid the ould people's blessin', As they leant from the door To look out at you pass; Wid the colleen's kiss-hand, And the childer's caressin', And the boys fightin', sure, Which'd stand your first glass. Thin you'd give us the news Out of Cork and Killarney— Had O'Shea married yet?— Was ould Mack still at work?— Shine's political views— Barry's last bit of blarney— And the boys you had met On their way to New York. And whin, from the sight Of our say-frontin' village, The far frownin' Blasquet Stole into the shade, And the warnin' of night Called up from the tillage The girl wid her basket, The boy wid his spade— By the glowin' turf-fire, Or the harvest moon's glory, In the close-crowded ring That around you we made, We'd no other desire Than your heart-thrillin' story, Or the song that you'd sing, Or the tune that you played. Till you'd ax, wid a leap From your seat in the middle, And a shuffle and slide Of your foot on the floor, “Will we try a jig-step, Boys and girls, to the fiddle?” “Faugh a ballagh,” we cried, “For a jig to be sure.” For whinever you'd start Jig or planxty so merry, Wid their caperin' twirls And their rollickin' runs, Where's the heel or the heart In the Kingdom of Kerry Of the boys and the girls Wasn't wid you at once? So you'd tune wid a sound That arose as delightin' As our own colleen's voice, So sweet and so clear, As she coyly wint round, Wid a curtsey invitin' The best of the boys For the fun to prepare. For a minute or so, Till the couples were ready, On your shoulder and chin The fiddle lay quiet; Then down came your bow So quick and so steady, And away we should spin To the left or the right! Thin how Micky Dease Forged steps was a wonder, And well might our women Of Roseen be proud— Such a face, such a grace, And her darlin' feet under, Like two swallows skimmin' The skirts of a cloud. Thin, Thady, ochone! Come back, for widout you We are never as gay As we were in the past! O, Thady, mavrone, Why, thin, I wouldn't doubt you Huzzah! boys, huzzah! Here's O'Farrell at last! BAT OF THE BRIDGE On the Bridge of Dereen, Away up by Killarney, You'll be sure to be seein' Poor Batsy O'Kearney, A big stick in the air So lazily swingin', Smokin' and jokin' And carelessly singin' Some snatch of a song, Out over the river, As it rushes along For iver and iver To the Bay of Kenmare. Six foot six Is the fix Of his height, Honour bright! Forty-eight the diminsion Round his ribs by my inchin'; It's murther to say Such a man's thrun away! He's the last to delay And the earliest comer On the bridge by the bay, Winter and summer. Do you question why so? What keeps him for iver Smokin' and jokin' And out on the river, That rushes below, Serenadin' so gaily? 'Twas the cowardly blow Of a tinker's shillelagh Left the proper man so. But you're wonderin', why, How at all it could happen Such a broth of a boy Got the scandalous rappin'. 'Twas September fair day, And the Adragole faction Wid Dereen for the green And the bridge were in action; And from off the bridge road, Wid his cudgel so clever, Bat was leatherin' a load Of Cork men for ever, Just as if it was play. When up from beneath, Still further and further, Houldin' tight in his teeth A stick that was murther, That black tinker stole, By the ivy boughs clingin', On the edge of the bridge The knees softly swingin'; And, unknownst at his back, From the wall of the river Fetched O'Kearney a crack That left him for iver Wid a poor, puzzled poll. Did he fall? Not at all! But he picked off that tinker Like a snail from the wall And before you could think or Repate your own name, Cot the stick from the ruffi'n, Knocked him dead on the head, And widout shroud or coffin Tossed him into the tide. And his black corpse for ever From Ireland should glide, For her good soil could never Cover up such a shame. Thin backward agin Wid a bitter screech flyin' On the Adragole men, Just as they were cryin' “The bridge is our own”— In their thick, like a flail, he Swung, till it sung, The tinker's shillelagh; So that staggerin' down, Broken and batthered, Out of the town All Adragole scatthered Before Batsy alone. Ever since which Poor Bat's only iday Is to sit on the bridge, Wet day or dry day, Wid that stick in his fist; And no tinkerin' fellas Dare to come there Wid their pots and their bellas, And all Adragole Takes the ford down the river, For fear that the fool On the bridge end for iver Should give them a twist. So he's come by a name, The English of which, Sir, Translatin' that same, Is “Bat of the Bridge,” Sir. But the hour's growin' late; Good-night and safe journey! It's afloat in your boat You should be, Doctor Corney. By myself, now, bad scran To the tribe of the tinkers! For they've left a good man, Like a horse widout blinkers, All bothered and bate. Six foot six Is the height Of poor Batsy to-night, Forty-eight the diminsion Round his ribs by my inchin', It's murther to say Such a man's thrun away! RODDY MOR, THE ROVER Of all the roaming Jacks that yet to Farranfore kem over As paramount I'd surely count ould Roddy Mor, the Rover; Wid steeple hat and stiff cravat and nate nankeen knee breeches, And on his back a pedlar's pack just rowlin' o'er wid riches. For so it was when o'er the hill his coat-tails they'd come flyin', The sharpest tongue of all was still, the crossest child quit cryin', Ould women even left their tay, ould men their glass of toddy, An', spoon in hand, a welcome grand would wave and wave to Roddy. An' when his treasure he'd unlade in view of all the village, In from her milkin' ran the maid, the boy from out the tillage, The while the rogue in each new vogue the lasses he'd go drapin', Until their lads his ribbons, plaids and rings had no escapin'. “Now, whisht your prate, and take your toys,” cried he, “my darlin' childer, Or my new ballads wid your noise complately you'll bewilder.” Then his Come-all-Yees he'd advance wid such a quare comether, That you might say he tuk away our sinse and pince together. But there! of all the roaming Jacks that trass the counthry over, For paramount I'd ever count ould Roddy Mor, the Rover. For 'deed an' I believe that when his sperrit parts his body, If he's allowed, he'll draw a crowd in Heaven itself will Roddy. OULD DOCTOR MACK Ye may tramp the world over from Delhi to Dover, And sail the salt say from Archangel to Arragon; Circumvint back through the whole Zodiack, But to ould Docther Mack ye can't furnish a paragon. Have ye the dropsy, the gout, the autopsy? Fresh livers and limbs instantaneous he'll shape yez; No way infarior in skill, but suparior And lineal postarior to ould Aysculapius. Chorus He and his wig wid the curls so carroty, Aigle eye and complexion clarety; Here's to his health, Honour and wealth, The king of his kind and the cream of all charity. How the rich and the poor, to consult for a cure, Crowd on to his door in their carts and their carriages, Showin' their tongues or unlacin' their lungs, For divel wan symptom the docther disparages. Troth an' he'll tumble for high or for humble From his warm feather-bed wid no cross contrariety; Makin' as light of nursin' all night The beggar in rags as the belle of society. Chorus He and his wig wid the curls so carroty, Aigle eye and complexion clarety, Here's to his health, Honour and wealth, The king of his kind and the cream of all charity. And, as if by a meracle, ailments hysterical, Dad, wid one dose of bread pills he can smother, And quench the love sickness wid comical quickness, Prescribin' the right boys and girls to each other. And the sufferin' childer! Your eyes 'twould bewilder To see the wee craythurs his coat tails unravellin'— Each of them fast on some treasure at last, Well knowin' ould Mack's just a toy-shop out travellin'. Chorus He and his wig wid the curls so carroty, Aigle eye and complexion clarety; Here's to his health, Honour and wealth, The king of his kind and the cream of all charity. Thin, his doctherin' done, in a rollickin' run Wid the rod or the gun he's the foremost to figure; Be Jupiter Ammon! what jack-snipe or salmon E'er rose to backgammon his tail-fly or trigger! And hark that view holloa! 'Tis Mack in full follow On black “Faugh-a-ballagh” the country-side sailin'! Och, but you'd think 'twas ould Nimrod in pink, Wid his spurs cryin' chink over park wall and palin'. Chorus He and his wig wid the curls so carroty, Aigle eye and complexion clarety. Here's to his health, Honour and wealth, Hip, hip, hooray, wid all hilarity! Hip, hip, hooray! That's the way! All at once widout disparity! One more cheer for our docther dear, The king of his kind and the cream of all charity Hip, hip, hooray! COUNTRYSIDE COLLEENS THE ROSE OF KENMARE I've been soft in a small way On the girleens of Galway, And the Limerick lasses have made me feel quare; But there's no use denyin' No girl I've set eye on Could compate wid Rose Ryan of the town of Kenmare. O, where Can her like be found? Nowhere, The country round, Spins at her wheel Daughter as true, Sets in the reel, Wid a slide of the shoe, a slinderer, tinderer, purtier, wittier colleen than you, Rose, aroo! Her hair mocks the sunshine, And the soft, silver moonshine Neck and arm of the colleen complately eclipse; Whilst the nose of the jewel Slants straight as Carn Tual From the heaven in her eye to her heather-sweet lips. O, where, &amp;c. Did your eyes ever follow The wings of the swallow Here and there, light as air, o'er the meadow field glance? For if not you've no notion Of the exquisite motion Of her sweet little feet as they dart in the dance. O, where, &amp;c. If y' inquire why the nightingale Still shuns the invitin' gale That wafts every song-bird but her to the West, Faix she knows, I suppose, Ould Kenmare has a Rose That would sing any Bulbul to sleep in her nest. O, where, &amp;c. When her voice gives the warnin' For the milkin' in the mornin' Ev'n the cow known for hornin' comes runnin' to her pail; The lambs play about her And the small bonneens snout her, Whilst their parints salute her wid a twisht of the tail. O, where, &amp;c. When at noon from our labour We draw neighbour wid neighbour From the heat of the sun to the shilter of the tree, Wid spuds fresh from the bilin' And new milk you come smilin', All the boys' hearts beguilin', alannah machree! O, where, &amp;c. But there's one sweeter hour When the hot day is o'er And we rest at the door wid the bright moon above, And she sittin' in the middle, When she's guessed Larry's riddle, Cries, “Now for your fiddle, Shiel Dhuv, Shiel Dhuv! O, where Can her like be found? Nowhere, The country round, Spins at her wheel Daughter as true, Sets in the reel, Wid a slide of the shoe, a slinderer, tinderer, purtier, wittier colleen than you, Rose, aroo! FAN FITZGERL Wirra, wirra! ologone! Can't ye lave a lad alone, Till he's proved there's no tradition left of any other girl— Not even Trojan Helen, In beauty all excellin'— Who's been up to half the divlement of Fan Fitzgerl. Wid her brows of silky black Arched above for the attack, Her eyes they dart such azure death on poor admirin' man; Masther Cupid, point your arrows, From this out, agin the sparrows, For your bested at Love's archery by young Miss Fan. See what showers of goolden thread Lift and fall upon her head, The likes of such a trammel-net at say was niver spread For, whin accurately reckoned, 'Twas computed that each second Of her curls has cot a Kerryman and kilt him dead. Now mintion, if ye will, Brandon Mount and Hungry Hill, Or Ma'g'llicuddy's Reeks renowned for cripplin' all they can; Still the countryside confisses None of all its precipices Cause a quarther so much carnage as the nose of Fan. But your shatthered hearts suppose Safely steered apast her nose, She's a current and a reef beyant to wreck them rovin' ships. My maning it is simple; For that current is her dimple, And the cruel reef 'twill coax ye to 's her coral lips. I might inform ye further Of her bosom's snowy murther, And an ankle ambuscadin' through her gown's delightful whirl; But what need, when all the village Has forsook its peaceful tillage, And flown to war and pillage all for Fan Fitzgerl! EVA TUOHILL Who's not heard of Eva Tuohill, Munster's purest, proudest jewel— Queen of Limerick's lovely maidens, Cork's colleens, and Galway's girls— With her slender shape that's swimmin' Like a swan among the women, With her voice of silver cadence, And her crown of clustering curls? O! the eyes of Eva Tuohill! Now, why wouldn't Cromwell cruel Just have called two centuries later With his cannon at Tervoe? For, one flash of angry azure Through that silky black embrasure, And away old Noll should scatter With his army out of view. Is't describe you, Eva Tuohill, With the dozenth rapier duel Fought to fix her sweet complexion And the colour of her hair? Is it picture you her figure, That's compelled so many a trigger Take the deadliest direction Through the early morning air? Well, no wonder, Eva Tuohill! Since you're just one glorious jewel, Lit with lovely flying flushes From delightful lip to brow; Now in dreams your eyes they darkle, Now with joy they dance and sparkle; Now your cheek is bathed in blushes, Drowned in dimpled laughter now. But your beauty, Eva Tuohill, Is no opal false and cruel; Nor the meteor star deceiving, Flashing ruin from above. No! but some divinest splendour, Out of angels' tear-drops tender Crystalled, in one Iris weaving Faith and Hope and Virgin Love. NANCY, THE PRIDE OF THE WEST We have dark lovely looks on the shores where the Spanish From their gay ships came gallantly forth, And the sweet shrinking violets sooner will vanish Than modest blue eyes from our north; But, oh! if the fairest of fair-daughtered Erin Gathered round at her golden request, There's not one of them all that she'd think worth comparing With Nancy, the pride of the west. You'd suspect her the statue the Greek fell in love with, If you chanced on her musing alone, Or some Goddess great Jove was offended above with, And chilled to a sculpture of stone; But you'd think her no colourless, classical statue, When she turned from her pensive repose, With her glowing grey eyes glancing timidly at you, And the blush of a beautiful rose. Have you heard Nancy sigh? then you've caught the sad echo From the wind harp enchantingly borne. Have you heard the girl laugh? then you've heard the first cuckoo Carol summer's delightful return. And the songs that poor ignorant country folk fancy The lark's liquid raptures on high, Are just old Irish airs from the sweet lips of Nancy, Flowing up and refreshing the sky. And though her foot dances so soft from the heather To the dew-twinkling tussocks of grass, It but warns the bright drops to slip closer together To image the exquisite lass; We've no men left among us, so lost to emotion, Or scornful, or cold to her sex, Who'd resist her, if Nancy once took up the notion To set that soft foot on their necks. Yet, for all that the bee flies for honey-dew fragrant To the half-opened flower of her lips, And the butterfly pauses, the purple-eyed vagrant, To play with her pink finger-tips; From all human lovers she locks up the treasure A thousand are starving to taste, And the fairies alone know the magical measure Of the ravishing round of her waist. MOLLEEN OGE Molleen oge, my Molleen oge, Go put on your natest brogue, And slip into your smartest gown, You rosy little rogue; For a message kind I bear To yourself from ould Adair, That Pat the Piper's come around And there'll be dancin' there. Molleen dear, I'd not presume To encroach into your room, But I'd forgot a fairin' I'd brought you from Macroom; So open! and I swear Not one peep upon you; there! 'Tis a silver net to gather At the glass your golden hair. Molleen pet, my Molleen pet. Faix I'm fairly in a fret At the time you're titivatin' Molleen, aren't you ready yet? Now net and gown and brogue, Are you sure you're quite the vogue? But, bedad, you look so lovely I'll forgive you, Molleen oge! COUNTRYSIDE COURTSHIPS LONESOME LOVERS SHE Ochone! Patrick Blake, You're off up to Dublin, And sure for your sake I'm the terrible trouble in; For I thought that I knew What my “Yes” and my “No” meant, Till I tried it on you That misfortunate moment. But somehow I find, Since I sent Pat away, It must be in my mind I was wishful he'd stay. While ago the young rogue Came and softly stooped over, And gave me a pogue As I stretched in the clover; How I boxed his two ears, And axed him “How dare he?” Now I'd let him for years— 'Tis the way women vary. For somehow I find, Since I sent Pat away, It must be in my mind I was wishful he'd stay. Oh! why wouldn't he wait To put his comether Upon me complate, When we both were together? But no, Patrick, no; You must have me consentin' Too early, and so Kitty's late for repentin'. For somehow I find, Since I sent Pat away, It must be in my mind I was wishful he'd stay. HE Oh! Kitty O'Hea, I'm the terrible trouble in, For you're at Rossbeigh And myself is in Dublin, Through mistaking, bedad! Your blushes and that trick Of sighing you had Showed a softness for Patrick. And yet from my mind A voice seems to spake:— “Go back, and you'll find That she's fond of you, Blake!” Oh! Dublin is grand, As all must acknowledge, Wid the Bank on one hand, On the other the College. I'd be proud to be Mayor Of so splendid a city, But I'd far sooner share A cabin wid Kitty. And I may so some day, For that voice in my mind Keeps seeming to say:— “After all she'll be kind.” Oh! Dublin is fine Wid her ships on the river, And her iligant line Of bridges forever. But, Kitty, my dear, I'd exchange them this minute For our small little pier And my boat, and you in it. And I may so some day, For that voice in my mind Keeps seeming to say:— “After all she'll be kind.” Here you've beautiful squares For all to be gay in, Promenading in pairs, Wid the band music playin'; But if I'd my choice, Where our green hollies glisten, To Kitty's sweet voice I'd far sooner listen. And I may so some day, For that voice in my mind Keeps seeming to say:— “After all she'll be kind.” Here's a wonderful Park, Where the wild beasts are feedin' For the world like No'h's Ark Or the Garden of Eden! But, faix! of the two, I'd rather be sittin' Manœuvring, aroo! Wid your comical kitten. And I may so some day, For that voice in my mind Keeps seeming to say:— “After all she'll be kind.” Yes, Dublin's a Queen Wid her gardens and waters, And her buildings between For her sons and her daughters; In learning so great, So lovely and witty; But she isn't complate At all widout Kitty. And that voice in my mind— “Go back to the South!”— So I will, then, and find What you mane from her mouth. THE POTATO BLOSSOM As fiddle in hand I crossed the land, Wid homesick heart so weighty, I chanced to meet A girl so sweet That she turned my grief to gai'ty. Now what cause for pause Had her purty feet? Faix, the beautiful flower of the pratee. Then more power to the flower of the pratee, The beautiful flower of the pratee, For fixin' the feet Of that colleen sweet, On the road to Cincinnati. You'd imagine her eye Was a bit of blue sky, And her cheek had a darlin' dimple; Her footstep faltered, She blushed, and altered Her shawl wid a timid trimble. And, “Oh, sir, what's the blossom You wear on your bosom?” She asked most sweet and simple. I looked in her face To see could I trace Any hint of lurkin' levity; But there wasn't a line Of her features fine But expressed the gentlest gravity. So quite at my aise At her innocent ways, Wid sorra a sign of brevity, Says I, “Don't you know Where these blossoms blow, And their name of fame, mavourneen? I'd be believin' You were deceivin' Shiel Dhuv this summer mornin', If your eyes didn't shine So frank on mine, Such a schemin' amusement scornin'. Now I don't deny 'Twould be asy why, Clane off widout any reflection— Barely to name The plant of fame Whose flower is your eye's attraction; Asy for me, But to you, machree, Not the slenderest satisfaction; For somehow I know If I answered you so, You'd be mad you could disrimimber In what garden or bower You'd seen this flower Or adornin' what forest timber, Or where to seek For its fruit unique From June until Novimber. Since thin, I reply, You take such joy In this blossom I love so dearly, Wid a bow like this Shall I lave you, miss, Whin I've mentioned the name of it merely; Or take your choice, Wid music and voice, Shall I sing you its history clearly?” “Oh! the song, kind sir, I'd much prefer,” She answered wid eager gai'ty. So we two and the fiddle Turned off from the middle Of the road to Cincinnati, And from under the shade That the maples made I sang her “The Song of the Pratee. BLACKBERRYING When I was but a weeshy boy, My mother's pride, my father's joy, My mouth and hands had full employ, When blackberries grew ripe; And oft my mammy she should squeeze The thorns from out my arms and knees, And my good dad, to give me ease, Put by his favourite pipe. And even since I've become a man, And dressed on quite a different plan, I've still gone carrying the can, When blackberries grew sweet. Yes! trampling through the bramble brakes, I'd court the keenest pains and aches For two or three fair colleens' sakes, Whose names I'll not repeat. Till Norah of the amber hair, Who'd been my partner here and there, Around about and everywhere, When blackberries came in; As I just tried with too much haste The richer, rarer fruit to taste, That on her lips was goin' to waste, She tosses up her chin, And marches by me night and morn, Her grey eyes only glancing scorn, Regardless of the bitter thorn That in my heart she's rooting! Yet, somehow, something in my mind Keeps murmuring, when she's most unkind, “Have patience! she'll make friends, you'll find, Ere blackberries finish fruiting!” LOVE'S HALLOWED SEAL When sky-larks soaring to Heav'n were pouring The trembling cadence of their long, sweet cry; As lone I wandered and pensive pondered, My Queen of Maidens she came musing by. Her footstep faltered, she blushed and altered Her crimson kerchief with gesture shy; It could not hide her, and so beside her I took the mountain track to old Athy. Till as we rounded the ridge that bounded The cowslip meadow from the coom below, A sad, slow tolling, from far uprolling, Cast sudden shadow on my colleen's brow. In prayer low bending she knelt, commending The parting spirit to Heav'n above, And that one motion of pure devotion Has set a hallowed seal upon my love. THE MILKING CAN All in Tipp'rary's Golden Vale I met with Kate Magee, Upon her poll the milking pail, A lamb beside her knee. O, her eyes were dreams of blue, With the sunlight dancing through, And her laughing lips the hue Of the rose upon the tree; And a step so light, the daisies white Scarce stirr'd upon the lea. For a year, an eager, aching year, With pleasure hard by pain, And many a hope and many a fear, I'd sought her love to gain. Ev'ry art of tongue and eye Fond lads with lasses try, I had used with ceaseless sigh— Yet all, yet all in vain; And a fortnight since she made me wince With her wit in that very lane. But that morning, at the tender tale Of trouble in my eyes, Her footsteps fail, she lowers her pail, And soft my name she sighs; And a happy, happy man, I'd her slender waist to span, And a kiss above her can, And a small hand for my prize, As soft as silk, as white as milk, And as warm as summer skies. CHANGING HER MIND As I rolled on my side-car to Santry Fair, I chanced round a corner on Rose Adair, Her shoes in her hands as she took the track, And a fowl in a basket upon her back. “Step up, Miss Rose! Och, that bird's luck, Attendin' the fair as Rose's duck, As Rose's duck, as Rose's duck!” “No! Shawn Magee, the bird's a goose, And to travel with two, there's no sort of use.” I couldn't but laugh, though I'd had it hot, But I fired, as I passed her, one partin' shot. “The poor second gander that got the worst,” Says I, “must leave Rose to mind the first. The creature must fly and boldly try To seem a swan in some girl's eye, Some other girl's eye, some other girl's eye. Good day to you, Rose, for I'd best push on, And perhaps at the fair I'll be some girl's swan.” But hardly a furlong away I'd flown, When plainly behind me I heard her moan. In a breath I was back, where she limped forlorn, With her purty foot pierced by a thumpin' thorn. With one soft squeeze I gave her ease; Then turning kind, say she, “I find I'm—changing—my—mind—I've changed my mind!” “Change more,” says I. “What's that?” says she. “Your name to mine. Be Rose Magee!” JENNY, I'M NOT JESTING “Ah, Jenny, I'm not jesting, Believe what I'm protesting, And yield what I'm requesting These seven years through.” “Ah, Lawrence, I may grieve you; Yet, if I can't relieve you, Sure, why should I deceive you With words untrue. But, since you must be courtin', There's Rosy and her fortune, 'Tis rumoured your consortin' With her of late. Or there's your cousin Kitty, So charming and so witty, She'd wed you out of pity, Kind Kate.” “Fie! Jenny, since I knew you, Of all the lads that woo you, None's been so faithful to you. If truth were told; Even when yourself was dartin' Fond looks at fickle Martin, Till off the thief went startin' For Sheela's gold.” “And, if you've known me longest, Why should your love be strongest, And his that's now the youngest, For that be worst?” “Fire, Jenny, quickest kindled Is always soonest dwindled, And thread the swiftest spindled Snaps first.” “If that's your wisdom, Larry, The longer I can tarry, The luckier I shall marry At long, long last.” “I've known of girls amusing, Their minds, the men refusing, Till none were left for choosing At long, long last.” “Well, since it seems that marriage Is still the safest carriage, And all the world disparage The spinster lone; Since you might still forsake me, I think I'll let you take me. Yes! Larry, you may make me Your own!” FIXIN' THE DAY PATRICK Arrah, answer me now, sweet Kitty Mulreddin, Why won't you be fixin' the day of our weddin'? KITTY Now, Patrick O'Brien, what a hurry you're in! Can't you wait till the summer comes round to begin? PATRICK O, no, Kitty machree, in all sinse and all raison, The winter's the properest marryin' saison; For to comfort oneself from the frost and the rain, There's nothin' like weddin' in winter, 'tis plain. KITTY If it's only protection you want from the cowld, There's a parish that's called the Equator, I'm tould, That for single young men is kept hot through the year. Where's the use of your marryin'? off wid you there! PATRICK But there's also a spot not so pleasantly warmed, Set aside for ould maids, if I'm rightly informed, Where some mornin', if still she can't make up her mind, A misfortune colleen, called Kathleen, you'll find. KITTY Is it threatenin' you are that I'll die an ould maid, Who refused, for your sake, Mr. Laurence M'Quaide? Faix! I think I'll forgive him; for this I'll be bound, He'd wait like a lamb till the summer came round. PATRICK Now it's thinkin' I am that this same Mr. Larry Is what makes you so slow in agreein' to marry. KITTY And your wish to be settled wid me in such haste Doesn't prove that you're jealous of him in the laste? PATRICK Well, we'll not say that Kitty'll die an ould maid. KITTY And we'll bother no more about Larry M'Quaide. PATRICK But, Kitty machree, sure those weddin's in spring, When the Long Fast is out, are as common a thing As the turfs in a rick, or the stones on a wall— Faith! you might just as well not be married at all. But a weddin', consider, at this side of Lent, Would be thought such a far more surprisin' event— So delightful to all at this dull time of year. Now say “Yes!” for the sake of the neighbours, my dear! KITTY No, Patrick, we'll wed when the woods and the grass Wave a welcome of purtiest green, as we pass Through the sweet cowslip meadow, and up by the mill To the chapel itself on the side of the hill— Where the thorn, that's now sighin' a widow's lamint, In a bridesmaid's costume 'll be smilin' contint, And the thrush and the blackbird pipe, “Haste to the weddin', Of Patrick O'Brien and Kitty Mulreddin.” PATRICK Will you really promise that, Kitty, you rogue? KITTY Whisper, Patrick, the contract I'll seal wid—a pogue. [Kissing him. BARNEY BRALLAGHAN (Adapted) On a night of June A fine young Irish farmer Thus takes up his tune, Complainin' to his charmer; “'Tis a twelve-month, Kate, Since I first came courtin', Yet my suit you trate Still with cruel sportin'. Och, just say You'll be Mrs. Brallaghan! Don't say nay, Charmin' Kitty Callaghan!” “Eyes, whose heavenly ray Shot through shadowy fringes, Cost me in one day Twenty thousand twinges. Dimpled chin and cheek, Whose hue just sets me silly, Since, 'tis hide and seek Betwixt the rose and lily. Beauty's star, Charmin' Kitty Callaghan, That's what you are, Sighs poor Barney Brallaghan.” “And though there's just a doubt, If I've enough of cash, dear, You've the lovely mout' And I the grand moustache, dear; You've the genteel taste, And I'm the boy to hit it; You've the perfect waist, And I the arm to fit it. So just say You'll be Mrs. Brallaghan; Don't say nay, Charmin' Kitty Callaghan!” COUNTRYSIDE COUPLES THE REAPER'S REVENGE Oft and oft I dream, astore, With secret sighs and laughter, How once you reaped the field before, And I came gatherin' after. While tenderly, tenderly, with the corn Looks of love you threw me; Till I stood up with eyes of scorn And withered your hope to woo me. Oft and oft I'm dreamin' still, With smiles and tears together, Of how I stretched, so weak and ill, Thro' all the wintry weather; While tenderly, tenderly, still you'd tap, Seeking news of Norah; Till I grew fonder of your rap Than father's voice, acora! Most I mind the plan conceal'd That thro' the spring amused you, To wait to find me in the field, Where rashly I refused you; Then earnestly, earnestly, in my eyes Gaze, till I return'd you The look of looks and sigh of sighs On the spot where once I spurn'd vou. THE LIGHT IN THE SNOW Oh! Pat, the bitter day when you bravely parted from us, The mother and myself on the cruel quays of Cork: When you took the long kiss, and you gave the faithful promise That you'd soon bring us over to be wid you at New York. But the times they grew worse through the wild, weary winter, And my needle all we had to find livin' for us two; While the mother drooped and drooped till I knelt down forenint her And closed her dyin' eyes, dear—but still no word of you. Then the neighbours thought you false to me, but I knew you better, Though the bud became the leaf, and the corn began to start; And the swallow she flew back, and still sorra letter, But I sewed on and on, Pat, and kep' a stout heart. Till the leaves they decayed, and the rook and the starlin' Returned to the stubble, and I'd put by enough To start at long last in search of my darlin' Alone across the ocean so unruly and rough. Until at the end, very weak and very weary, I reached the overside, and started on my search; But no account for ever of Patrick for his Mary, By advertisin' for you, dear, or callin' you in church. Yet still I struggled on, though my heart was almost broken And my feet torn entirely on the rough, rugged stone; Till that day it came round, signs by and by token, The day five year that we parted you, mavrone! Oh! the snow it was sweepin' through the dark, silent city, And the cruel wind it cut through my thin, tattered gown. Still I prayed the good God on his daughter to take pity; When a sudden, strange light shone forenint me up the town. And the light it led on till at last right opposite A large, lonely house it vanished, as I stood, Wid my heart axing wildly of me, was it, oh, was it A warnin' of ill or a token of good? When the light kindled up agin, brighter and bigger, And the shadow of a woman across the windy passed; While close, close, and closer to her stole a man's figure, And I fainted, as you caught me in your true arms at last. Then Pat, my own Pat, I saw that you were altered To the shadow of yourself by the fever on the brain! While “Mary, Mary darlin',” at last your lips they faltered, You've given your poor Patrick his mem'ry back again.” And the good, gentle priest, when he comes, is never weary Of sayin', as he spakes of that light in the snow, “The Lord heard your prayer, and in pity for you, Mary, Restored Pat the raison that he lost long ago.” THE BLUE, BLUE SMOKE Oh! many and many a time In the dim old days, When the chapel's distant chime Pealed the hour of evening praise, I've bowed my head in prayer; Then shouldered scythe or bill, And travelled free of care To my home across the hill; Whilst the blue, blue smoke Of my cottage in the coom, Softly wreathing, Sweetly breathing, Waved my thousand welcomes home. For oft and oft I've stood, Delighted in the dew, Looking down across the wood, Where it stole into my view— Sweet spirit of the sod, Of our own Irish earth, Going gently up to God From the poor man's hearth. O, the blue, blue smoke Of my cottage in the coom, Softly wreathing, Sweetly breathing My thousand welcomes home. But I hurried swiftly on, When Herself from the door Came swimming like a swan Beside the Shannon shore; And after her in haste, On pretty, pattering feet, Our rosy cherubs raced Their daddy dear to meet; While the blue, blue smoke Of my cottage in the coom, Softly wreathing, Sweetly breathing, Waved my thousand welcomes home. But the times are sorely changed Since those dim old days, And far, far I've ranged From those dear old ways; And my colleen's golden hair To silver all has grown, And our little cherub pair Have cherubs of their own; And the black, black smoke, Like a heavy funeral plume, Darkly wreathing, Fearful breathing, Crowns the city with its gloom. But 'tis our comfort sweet, Through the long toil of life, That we'll turn with tired feet From the noise and the strife, And wander slowly back In the soft western glow, Hand in hand, by the track That we trod long ago; Till the blue, blue smoke Of our cottage in the coom, Softly wreathing, Sweetly breathing, Waves our thousand welcomes home. TROTTIN' TO THE FAIR Trottin' to the fair, Me and Moll Malony, Sated, I declare, On a single pony; How am I to know that Molly's safe behind, Wid our heads in oh! that Awk'ard way inclined? By her gintle breathin' Whispered past my ear, And her white arms wreathin' Warm around me here. Trottin' to the fair, Me and Moll Malony, Sated, I declare, On a single pony. Yerrig! Masther Jack, Lift your fore-legs higher, Or a rousin' crack Surely you'll require. “Ah!” says Moll, “I'm frightened That the pony'll start,” And her hands she tightened On my happy heart; Till, widout reflectin', 'Twasn't quite the vogue, Somehow, I'm suspectin' That I snatched a pogue. Trottin' to the fair, Me and Moll Malony, Sated, I declare, On a single pony. JOULTIN' TO THE FAIR Joultin' to the fair, Three upon the pony, That so lately were Me and Moll Malony. “How can three be on, boy? Sure, the wife and you, Though you should be wan, boy, Can't be more nor two.” Arrah, now then may be You've got eyes to see That this purty baby Adds us up to three. Joultin' to the fair, Three upon the pony, That so lately were Me and Moll Malony. Come, give over, Jack, Cap'rin' and curvettin', All that's on your back Foolishly forgettin'; For I've tuk the notion Wan may cant'rin' go, Trottin' is a motion I'd extind to two; But to travel steady Matches best with three, And we're that already, Mistress Moll and me. Joultin' to the fair, Three upon the pony, That so lately were Me and Moll Malony. COUNTRYSIDE HUMOURS THE CONFESSION A lovely lass with modest mien Stole out one morning early; The dew-drops glancing o'er the green Made all her pathway pearly. Young Lawrence, struck with Cupid's dart— Cupid's dart distressing— As through the fields he saw her start, Sighed, “She's gone confessing! O vo! 'twould ease my heart To earn the father's blessing.” The father with a twinkling eye, He watched my boyo cunning, Unnoticed by his colleen's eye, Behind the bushes running. “How well,” he laughed, “young Lawrence there, After all my pressing, With his sweetheart, I declare, Comes at last confessing. Oho! I'll just take care To give the lad a lesson.” The pleasant priest unbarred the door, As solemn as a shadow, “How slow,” cried he, “you've come before, How hot-foot, now, my laddo! The serious steal with looks sedate, Seeking to be shriven, But you, you're in no fitting state Now to be forgiven. So, go within and wait With all your thoughts on heaven.” The fair one, following in a while, Made out her faults with meekness; The priest then asked her with a smile Had she no other weakness, And led with that young Lawrence in; Her cheeks were now confessing. “Well since 'tis after all a sin Easy of redressing, Here, dear, I'd best begin To give you both my blessing.” THE DISCOVERY OF WHISKEY Beimeedh a gole! Fill up the bowl, Let us console Dull care wid a glass, boys! Shall it be wine, Fragrant and fine Fresh smuggled from Spain underneath a mattrass, boys! No! all of those pleasant Casks out of Cadiz, Leave as a present, Lads, for the ladies! But for ourselves, sure, what should we say But whiskey for ever till dawnin' of day! Beimeedh a gole! Beimeedh a gole! Wasn't it droll, He that first stole Fire from Heav'n's grate, boys! Look now, was left Chained to a cleft, A century through, for an aigle to ate, boys! St. Pat tho', when stealin' Fire from that quarter, Kept it concealin' Snug under water, Till he'd conveyed it safe to the ground, Then look'd, and, begorra, 'twas whiskey he found! Beimeedh a gole! Beimeedh a gole! Each wid his poll Quite in control, For all it's containin'; Smilin' we sit, Warmin' our wit Wid nectar the Gods might begrudge us the drainin'. Now ere we go snoozin' Under the clothes, Don't be refusin' One health I propose; Here's to the darlin', pale as the dew, That pounds purple Bacchus and all of his crew! Beimeedh a gole! ONE AT A TIME As she sat spinnin' beside her door, Sweet Kitty Kelly of Farranfore, In dropped, as often he'd done before, Ned Byrne, the young Schoolmaster. He took the seat that she signed him to And then that same to her side he drew, When up there hurried big Tom McHugh Who lived by lath and plaster. He took the seat that Miss Kate supplied And drew that same to her other side. “Now do spake one at a time,” she cried, “And we'll get on the faster.” Says Ned, “Miss Kelly, but don't you see, My business needs but yourself and me.” “Then since, at present at least, we're three, 'Twill have to wait,” says Kitty. “Now, Tom McHugh, 'tis your turn to start.” “Well then, Miss Kitty, first come apart.” “And hurt poor Ned to the very heart! Your selfish plans I pity. But since I've guessed what you're both about, P'r'aps now 'tis best not to leave you in doubt; So here's the whole of the murder out— I'm promised to Daniel Whitty.” THE KILKENNY CATS In the dacent ould days Before stockings or stays Were invented, or breeches, top-boots and top-hats, You'd search the whole sphere From Cape Horn to Cape Clear And never come near to the likes of our Cats Och, tunder! och, tunder! You'd wink wid the wonder To see them keep under the mice and the rats; And go wild for half shares In the phisants and hares They pull'd up the backstairs to provision our Pats Och! the Cats of Kilkenny, Kilkenny's wild Cats! But the shame and the sin Of the Game Laws came in, Wid the gun and the gin of the landlord canats; And the whole box and dice Of the rats and the mice Made off in a trice from our famishing Cats What did the bastes do? What would I or you? Is it lie down and mew till we starved on our mats? Not at all, faix! but fall Small and great, great and small, Wid one grand caterwaul on each other's cravats. Och! the Cats of Kilkenny, Kilkenny's wild Cats! And that mortial night long We should hark, right or wrong, To the feast and the song of them cannibal Cats, Gladiath'rin away Till the dawn of the day In fifty-three sharps, semiquavers and flats And when we went round Wid the milk-carts we found Scattered over the ground, like a sprinkle of sprats— (All the rest, bit and sup, Of themselves they'd ate up) Only just the tip-ends of the tails of the Cats, Of the Cats of Kilkenny, Kilkenny's quare Cats! THE JUG OF PUNCH (Adapted) As I was sitting with my glass and spoon One pleasant evening in the month of June, A thrush sang out of an Ivy bunch And the tune he trolled was the Jug of Punch. Tooralloo, tooralloo, tooralloo, tooralloo! A Jug of Punch, a Jug of Punch, And the tune he trolled was the Jug of Punch. What more divarsion might a man require Than coorting a lass o'er a nate turf fire, With a Kerry pippin to cut and crunch, And on the table a Jug of Punch. Tooralloo, tooralloo, tooralloo, tooralloo! A Jug of Punch, a Jug of Punch, And on the table a Jug of Punch. The doctor fails with all his art To cure an impression upon the heart; But even the cripple forgets his hunch, When he's snug outside of a Jug of Punch. Tooralloo, tooralloo, tooralloo, tooralloo! A Jug of Punch, a Jug of Punch, When he's snug outside of a Jug of Punch. Let the mortial Gods drink their nectar wine, And the quality sip their claret fine, But I'd give you all their grapes in a bunch For one jolly pull at a Jug of Punch. Tooralloo, tooralloo, tooralloo, tooralloo! A Jug of Punch, a Jug of Punch, Oh, I'd give them all for a Jug of Punch. And when I'm dead and in my grave, No costly tombstone will I crave, But a quiet stretch in my native peat With a Jug of Punch at my head and feet. Tooralloo, tooralloo, tooralloo, tooralloo! A Jug of Punch, a Jug of Punch, Oh, more power to your elbow, my Jug of Punch! COLONEL CARTY When Carroll axed Kate for her heart and a hand That held just a hundred good acres of land, Her lovely brown eyes Opened wide with surprise And her lips they shot scorn at his saucy demand; “Young Carroll Maginn, put the beard to your chin And the change in your purse if a wife you would win.” Then Carroll made Kate his most illigant bow And off to The Diggin's stravaged from the plough; Till the beard finely grown, And the pockets full blown, Says he, “Maybe Kate might be kind to me now!” So home my lad came, Colonel Carty by name, To try a fresh fling at his cruel old flame. But when Colonel Carty in splendour steps in, For all his grand airs and great beard to his chin, “Och, lave me alone!” Cries Kate with a groan, “For my heart's in the grave wid poor Carroll Maginn.” “Hush sobbin' this minute, 'tis Carroll that's in it! I've caged you at last, then, my wild little linnet!” THE ASS AND THE PETTICOAT She hung her petticoat out to dry, Sweet Kitty Kelly of Achonry; When the Carroll's hungry ass came by And made his meal upon it. And when that same he had finished quite, Devourin' on with all his might, He choked to death, and sarve him right, On Kitty's sweet sunbonnet. When Carroll found his old jackass dead, He went completely off his head; “The Kellys have poisoned you, poor old Ned,” He spluttered like a porpoise. “Such cruel murder I never saw, The donkey's no more use than straw, But agin you Kellys I'll have the law, For I'll take out Habeas Corpus!” And since the judges were goin' about, The Kellys took a cross summons out For trespass and larceny through the mout', And they'd have no denial. And the Coroner, too, he came that way And sat on the ass in a field of hay. “'Tis felo-de-se,” says he, “I'd say; But I'll send the case for trial.” And when they came to the Sessions Court, You may say that the Wig and Gown had sport! “Ass-assination” was their report On the poor dead brayin' varmint. The Carrolls a farthing damages got, But for charmin' Kitty, why should they not, The Counsellors all subscribed on the spot A new bonnet and under garment. ONE SUNDAY AFTER MASS One Sunday after Mass, As Lawrence and his lass Through the green woods did pass All alone, and all alone! Chorus All alone, and all alone! He asked her for a pogue, But she called him a rogue, And she beat him with her brogue, Ochone and ochone! Chorus Ochone and ochone! At first my boy he bent, As if to take, content, His proper punishment. Small blame too, small blame! Chorus Small blame too, small blame! But on her purty foot, Unbothered by a boot, He pressed a warm salute. For shame! fie! for shame! Chorus For shame! fie! for shame. Then Larry gets the worst, For she boxed his ears at first, Then into tears she burst, Ochone and ochone! Chorus Ochone and ochone! But soon the artful rogue Soothed his crying colleen oge, Till she gave him just one pogue, All alone, and all alone! Chorus All alone, and all alone! THE INVENTION OF WINE As one day I was restin' Mount Mangerton's crest on, An ould hedge schoolmaster, so larned and fine, My comrade on the mountain, Began thus recountin', In this poem so romantic, The Invention of Wine. Before Bacchus could talk Or dacently walk, Down Olympus he leaped from the arms of his nurse; But though three years in all Were consumed by the fall He might have gone further and fared a deal worse For he chanced, you must know, On a flower and fruit show, In some parish below, at the Autumn Assizes, Where Solon and Crœsus, Who'd been hearin' the cases, By the people's consint were adjudgin' the prizes. “Fruit prize Number One There's no question upon— We award it,” they cried, in a breath, “to—the divle! By the powers of the delf' On your Lowness's shelf, Who's this Skylarking Elf wid his manners uncivil?” For widout even a ticket, That Deity wicked, Falling plump in their midst in a posture ungainly, Pucked that bunch of prize grapes Into all sorts of shapes And made them two Judges go on most profanely. “O, the deuce!” shouted Solon, “He's not left a whole un!” “It's the juice thin, indeed,” echoed Crœsus, half-cryin'; For a squirt of that same, Like the scorch of a flame, Was playing its game the ould Patriarch's eye in. Thin Solon said, “Tie him, At our pleasure we'll try him. Walk him off to the gaol, if he's able to stand it; If not, why, thin get sure, The loan of a stretcher, And convey him away! Do yez hear me command it?” But Crœsus, long life to you, Widout sorrow or strife to you, And a peaceable wife to you, that continted you'll die! Just thin you'd the luck The forefinger to suck That you'd previously stuck wid despair in your eye. No more that eye hurt you— For the excellent virtue Of the necther you'd sipped cured its smartin' at once, And you shouted to Solon, “Stop your polis patrollin'! Where's the sinse your ould poll in, you ignorant dunce? “Is it whip into quad A celestial God, For I'll prove in a crack that the crayther's divine. Look here! have a sup,” Some more juice he sopped up In a silver prize cup, and They First Tasted Wine Said Solon, “Be Japers, Put this in the papers; For this child wid his capers is divine widout doubt! Let's kneel down before him, And humbly adore him, Then we'll mix a good jorum of the drink he's made out.” Now the whole of this time That Spalpeen Sublime Was preparing his mind for a good coorse of howlin'; For you've noticed, no doubt, That the childer don't shout Till a minute or more on their heads they've been rowlin'. “Milleah, murther!” at last He shouted aghast, “My blood's flowin' as fast as a fountain of wather; It'll soon be all spilt, And then I'll be kilt”— Mistakin' the juice of the grapes for his slaughter. Thin, glancin' around, He them gintlemen found Their lips to the ground most adorin'ly placed, Though I'm thinking the tipple, Continuin' to ripple Round that sacred young cripple, their devotion increased. “By Noah's Ark and the Flood, They're drinking my blood. O you black vagabones!” shouted Bacchus, “take that!” Here wid infantile curses He up wid his thrysus And knocked the entire cavalcade of them flat. But soon to his joy That Celestial Boy, Comprehendin' the carnage that reddened the ground, Extendin' his pardon To all in the garden, Exclaimed wid a smile, as a crater he crowned— “My bould girls and boys, Be using your eyes; For you now recognise the god Bacchus in me. Come, what do you say To a slight dajoonay, Wid cowld punch and champagne, for I'm on for a spree?” So widout further pressing, Or the bother of dressing, Down to table they sat wid that Haythen Divine, And began celebratin', Wid the choicest of atin', And drinkin' like winkin' The Invention of Wine. THE HEROES OF THE SEA I'll tell you of a wonder that will stiffen up your hair, That happened two poor fishermen convenient to Cape Clear. They just had run their boat afloat, they'd hardly gripped an oar, When their dog leapt in, their cat stepped in, that ne'er did so before. Now what overcame the creatures to start from shore? Says one brother: “What's come o'er them two, who ne'er on land agree, To settle up their difference a-this-way on the sea?” “I consave,” replied the other, “'tis the portent we could wish For a powerful take of pilchard, since that same's their favourite fish.” 'Tis a symptom, for sure, of a power of fish. Well! when the risin' moon it showed a swiftly rushin' shoal, Their net they shot and found they'd got a purty tidy haul. But when a dozen yards of mesh they'd plumped into the hold, They saw their fish were fine say-rats, which made their blood run cold, As around and around them they screeched and rolled. But ere each rat could rip his way from out the noosin' net, Bedad, the jaws of Towzer or the claws of Tom he met. Then safely our two fishermen rowed home from out the bay, And Tom and Towzer from that time were haroes you may say, Round about the country-side, many and many a day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONGS AND BALLADS LOVE'S WISHES Would I were Erin's apple-blossom o'er you, Or Erin's rose, in all its beauty blown, To drop my richest petals down before you, Within the garden where you walk alone; In hope you'd turn and pluck a little posy, With loving fingers through my foliage pressed, And kiss it close and set it blushing rosy To sigh out all its sweetness on your breast. Would I might take a pigeon's flight towards you, And perch beside your window-pane above, And murmur how my heart of hearts it hoards you, O hundred thousand treasures of my love; In hope you'd stretch your slender hand and take me, And smooth my wildly-fluttering wings to rest, And lift me to your loving lips and make me My bower of blisses in your loving breast. And when the dew no longer pearls your roses, Nor gems your footprint on the glittering lawn, I'd follow you into the forest closes In the fond image of your sportive fawn; Till you should woo me 'neath the wavering cover With coaxing call and friendly hands and eyes, Where never yet a happy human lover His head has pillowed—mine to emparadise. SONGS OF MANY WATERS CREDHE'S LAMENT FOR CAIL O'er thy chief, thy rushing chief, Loch da Conn, Loud the haven is roaring; All too late, her deadly hate for Crimtha's son Yonder deep is deploring. Small comfort, I trow, to Credhe is her wail, Slender solace now, oh, my Cail! Ochone! och, wirrasthrue! can she who slew Bid thee back, Spirit soaring! Hark, the thrush from out Drumqueen lifts his keen Through the choir of the thrushes; With his mate, his screaming mate, o'er the green See! the red weasel rushes. Crushed on the crag lies Glensilen's doe, O'er her yon stag tells his woe, Thus, Cail, och, ochonee! for thee, for thee My soul's sorrow gushes. O, the thrush, the mourning thrush, mating shall sing, When the furze bloom is yellow; O, the stag, the grieving stag, in the spring With a fresh doe shall fellow! But love for me 'neath the ever-moving mound Of the scowling sea lieth drowned; While och, och, ollagone! the sea fowl moan And the sea beasts bellow. BALTIMORE BOAT SONG With swelling sail away, away! Our bark goes bounding o'er the bay. “Farewell, farewell, old Baltimore,” She curtseys, curtseys to the shore. Farewell, fond wives and children dear, From ev'ry ill Heav'n keep you clear; Till thro' the surge we stagger back, As full of herring as we'll pack. For when we've sowed and gardened here, Far off to other fields we'll steer; Our farm upon the distant deep, Where all at once you till and reap. There, there the reeling ridge we plough, Our coulter keen the cutter's prow; While fresh and fresh from out the trawl The fish by hundreds in we haul. Thou glorious sun, gleam on above O'er Erin, Erin, of our love. Ye ocean airs, preserve her peace, Ye night dews, yield her rich increase. Until, one glittering realm of grain, She waves her wanderers home again; And we come heaping from our hold A silver crop beside the gold. THE WRECK OF THE AIDEEN Is it cure me, docther, darlin'? an ould boy of siventy-four, Afther soakin' off Berehaven three and thirty hour and more, Wid no other navigation underneath me but an oar. God incrase ye, but it's only half myself is livin' still, An' there's mountin' slow but surely to my heart the dyin' chill; God incrase ye for your goodness, but I'm past all mortial skill. But ye'll surely let them lift me, won't you, docther, from below? Ye'll let them lift me surely—very soft and very slow— To see my ould ship Aideen wanst agin before I go? Lay my head upon your shoulder; thank ye kindly, docther, dear. Take me now; God bless ye, cap'n! now together! sorra fear! Have no dread that ye'll distress me—now, agin, ochone! I see her. Ologone! my Aideen's Aideen, christened by her laughin' lips, Wid a sprinkle from her finger, as ye started from the slips, Thirty year ago come Shrovetide, like a swan among the ships. And we both were constant to ye till the bitter, bitter day, Whin the typhus took my darlin,' and she pined and pined away, Till yourself's the only sweetheart that was left me on the say. So through fair and foul we'd travel, you and I thin, usen't we? The same ould coorse from Galway Bay, by Limerick and Tralee, Till this storm it shook me overboard, and murthered you, machree. But now, agra, the unruly wind has flown into the West, And the silver moon is shinin' soft upon the ocean's breast, Like Aideen's smilin' spirit come to call us to our rest. Still the sight is growin' darker, and I cannot rightly hear, The say's too cold for one so old; O, save me, cap'n, dear! Now its growin' bright and warm agin, and Aideen, Aideen's here. THE HERRING FLEET In the golden Autumn gloaming Our sweethearts loosed away, And their hookers brown went foaming Full race o'er Galway Bay. But through all their shouts and singing Broke in the breaker's tune, And the ghostly gulls came winging, In flocks to the frowning dune, And angry red was ringing The rising harvest moon. Then we girls went back to our spinning, But soon grew sore distressed To hear the storm beginning Far off in the wailing west. Till fearful lightning flashes Came darting round our reels— And dreadful thunder crashes Made dumb our dancing wheels, While with lips as white as ashes We prayed for our fishing keels. In the wild wet dawn we started In grief to the groaning shore, Where so lightly we had parted From our boys but the eve before. Then sure no angel's story Ever spoke such comfort sweet As the cry of the coastguard hoary, As he sighted each craft complete: “Our God has saved—to His glory— All hands of the herring fleet.” 'TWAS PRETTY TO BE IN BALLINDERRY 'Twas pretty to be in Ballinderry, 'Twas pretty to be in Aghalee, 'Twas prettier to be in little Ram's Island, Trysting under the ivy tree! Ochone, ochone! Ochone, ochone! For often I roved in little Ram's Island, Side by side with Phelimy Hyland, And still he'd court me and I'd be coy, Though at heart I loved him, my handsome boy! “I'm going,” he sighed, “from Ballinderry Out and across the stormy sea; Then if in your heart you love me, Mary, Open your arms at last to me.” Ochone, ochone! Ochone, ochone! I opened my arms; how well he knew me! I opened my arms and took him to me; And there, in the gloom of the groaning mast, We kissed our first and we kissed our last! “'Twas happy to be in little Ram's Island, But now 'tis as sad as sad can be; For the ship that sailed with Phelimy Hyland Is sunk for ever beneath the sea.” Ochone, ochone! Ochone, ochone! And 'tis oh! but I wear the weeping willow, And wander alone by the lonesome billow, And cry to him over the cruel sea, “Phelimy Hyland, come back to me!” MY MOUNTAIN LAKE My own lake of lakes, My lone lake of lakes, When the young blushing day Beside you awakes, The cold hoary mist, To gold glory kissed, Lifts laughing away O'er your cool amethyst. My fair lake of lakes, My rare lake of lakes, How your tartan, red gold, In the summer air shakes! Fold fluttering on fold Of purple heath bloom And gay, glancing broom, A joy to behold. My sad, sleeping lake! My mad, leaping lake! When the palled tempest powers Into agony break— Their tears scalding showers, Thunder moans their lament, Their garments grief-rent Thy broken hill bowers. Bright faint-heaving breast, By fond visions possessed! Not a wave frets thy beach, Scarce one ripple's unrest. Dim, weltering reach, Where the Priestess of Heaven And the Steadfast Stars Seven Hold Sibylline speech. FAR AWAY FROM HER SCORNING In the wan, mistful morning to Ocean's wild gales Afar from her scorning I loose my black sails; For my kiss was scarce cold on her cheek when she turned And my love for the gold of a renegade spurned. Under cloud chill and pallid, while hollow winds moan, Lies, alas! our green-valleyed, purple-peaked Innishowen; For as if my sad case she were sharing to-day, All her glory and grace she hides weeping away. Farewell, Lake of Shadows! Buncrana, farewell To your thymy sea-meadows, your fern-fluttering dell! Adieu, Donegal! o'er the waters death-wan, Under Heaven's heavy pall, like a ghost I am gone. JOHNNY COX As in the good ship “Annabel” We coasted off Corfu, A sudden storm upon us fell, And tore our timbers true, And rent our sails in two. Our top-mast tumbled by the board, Our mizen mast as well; Through flapping canvas, scourging cord, Above like our death-bell We heard the thunder knell. “Now cut away!” our Captain cries, “And like a cork she floats;” But axe in hand, with scowling eyes, Set teeth and cursing throats, The Lascars loose the boats. When Johnny Cox, who lay below, From off his fever bed Comes stagg'ring up, a ghastly show, As if from out the dead, And drives them back in dread. “What, quit your posts, ye cowards all, Here's ballast then for you!” With that he heaves a cannon ball Full crash the cutter through, And saves the ship and crew. But he, our hero, ere the rocks We rounded, drooped and died; And we should lower you, Johnny Cox, Lamenting, o'er the side Into the moaning tide. THE DAUGHTER OF THE ROCK As on Killarney's bosom blue We lay with lifted oars, He challenged with his clarion true The silent shores. And straight from off her mountain throne The Daughter of the Rock Took up that challenge, tone by tone, With airy mock. And twice and thrice from hill to hill She tossed it o'er the heather, Then drew the notes with one wild thrill Together. Like pearls of silver dew From a fragrant purple flower, Echo's secret heart into They shower. We floated on, and ever on, With many a warbled tune, Until above the water wan Awoke the moon Then with a sudden, strange surprise A clearer challenge came From out his eager lips, and eyes Of ardent flame. Like Echo answering his horn, At first I mocking met him; Till, lest e'en counterfeited scorn Should fret him, From all my heart strings caught, Faint as Echo's closing stress, Stole the answer that he sighing sought, Love's low “Yes!” LOVE SONGS A SONG OF KILLARNEY By the Lakes of Killarney one morning in May On my pipe of green holly I warbled away, While a blackbird high up on the arbutus tree Gave back my gay music with gushes of glee, When my Eileen's voice stole From the thicket of holly And turned just the whole Of our fluting to folly; And softly along Through the myrtle and heather The maid and her song Swept upon us together. 'Twas an old Irish tale full of passionate trust Of two faithful lovers long laid in the dust, And her eyes as she sang looked so far, far away, She went by me, nor knew she went by, where I lay And myself and the grass And the deeshy, red daisies Should let our love pass, Only whisp'ring her praises; While the lass and her lay Through the myrtle and heather Like a dream died away, O'er the mountain together. IF I WERE KING OF IRELAND My love's a match in beauty For every flower that blows, Her little ear's a lily, Her velvet cheek a rose; Her locks like gillygowans Hang golden to her knee. If I were king of Ireland, My Queen she'd surely be. Her eyes are fond forget-me-nots, And no such snow is seen Upon the heaving hawthorn bush As crests her bodice green. The thrushes when she's talking Sit listening on the tree. If I were king of Ireland, My Queen she'd surely be. WHEN SHE ANSWERED ME HER VOICE WAS LOW When she answered me her voice was low, But minstrel never matched his chords To such a wealth of warbled words In Temora's palace long ago. When her eyes looked back the love in mine, Not Erin's self upon my sight Has started out of stormy night With a bluer welcome o'er the brine. And no other orbs shall e'er eclipse That magic look of maiden love, And never song my soul shall move Like that low sweet answer on her lips. THE HOUR WE PARTED The hour we parted, When broken-hearted You clung around me, Maureen, aroo! I swore I'd treasure, Thro' pain and pleasure, Thro' health and sickness My love for you. And still that jewel, Thro' changes cruel Of fickle Fortune I'll jealous guard; Still let her vary, The jade contràry, If but my Mary Be my reward. Yes! scorn and anger, Distress and langour, They're welcome willing, The long day thro'; Could I feel certain That ev'ning's curtain But clos'd us nearer, Maureen, aroo! The dreamy shadows Along the meadows Go softly stealing, And falls the dew; And o'er the billows, Like faithful swallows, All, all my thoughts, dear, Fly home to you. With touches silken, I see you milkin' The crossest Kerry In Adragole; And like a fairy, You're singing, Mary, Till every keeler Is foaming full. The night is falling, And you are calling The cattle homeward, With coaxing tone; In God's own keeping, Awake or sleeping, 'Tis now I leave you, Maureen, mavrone! WITH FLUTTERING JOY How happy for the little birds From tree to tree, away and hither, To pour their pretty, warbling words, And fly with fluttering joy together! But let the sun rejoice the skies, Or sullen clouds his glory smother, With heavy hearts we still must rise, Far, far away from one another. Now leave those foolish, feathered things, O Fortune, Fortune, fond and cruel! And fit two pair of trusty wings Upon myself and Maurya jewel, That she and I from earth may start, And skim the sky on angel feather, Till from mid-heaven, heart to heart, With fluttering joy we fall together. THE FOGGY DEW Oh! a wan cloud was drawn O'er the dim, weeping dawn, As to Shannon's side I returned at last; And the heart in my breast For the girl I loved best Was beating—ah, beating, how loud and fast! While the doubts and the fears Of the long, aching years Seemed mingling their voices with the moaning flood; Till full in my path, Like a wild water-wraith, My true love's shadow lamenting stood. But the sudden sun kissed The cold, cruel mist Into dancing showers of diamond dew; The dark flowing stream Laughed back to his beam, And the lark soared singing aloft in the blue; While no phantom of night, But a form of delight Ran with arms outspread to her darling boy: And the girl I loved best On my wild, throbbing breast Hid her thousand treasures, with a cry of joy. I'D ROAM THE WORLD OVER WITH YOU “I'd roam the world over and over with you, O, Swan-neck, and Lark-voice, and Swallow-in-shoe, My Violets and Lilies, and Rose without rue, I'd roam the world over and over with you.” “If I roamed the world over, fond lover, with you, And we met the rude mountains, now what should I do?” “They would smooth themselves straight at one stroke of your shoe, And I'd course their crests over and over with you.” “My fond, foolish lover, still roaming with you, To cross the rough river now what should we do?” “To one great, shallow glass it would shrink from your shoe And admire, and admire, and admire you step through.” “But, ah! if still roaming, rash lover, with you, I reached the dread desert, say what could we do?” “Your breath of soft balm would the wilderness woo To break into blossom so heavenly of hue, That we'd rest at long last from our roaming, aroo!” MY LOVE'S AN ARBUTUS My love's an arbutus By the borders of Lene, So slender and shapely In her girdle of green; And I measure the pleasure Of her eye's sapphire sheen By the blue skies that sparkle Through that soft branching screen. But though ruddy the berry And snowy the flower That brighten together The arbutus bower, Perfuming and blooming Through sunshine and shower, Give me her bright lips And her laugh's pearly dower. Alas! fruit and blossom Shall scatter the lea, And Time's jealous fingers Dim your young charms, machree. But unranging, unchanging, You'll still cling to me, Like the evergreen leaf To the arbutus tree. STILL SIDE BY SIDE When at the altar Together kneeling To Heaven appealing, My loving wife, Without one falter Of faith, we plighted, With hands united, Our troth through life. And now, though anguish Our souls has smitten, Sad records written On cheek and brow; Doth our love languish? Ah, no! but nearer, Mavrone, and dearer Our hearts beat now. And though hereafter Inconstant fortune With cruel sporting Our lot deride; Her mocking laughter Can never grieve us, If she but leave us Still side by side. That prayer be granted! And closer leaning, Each other screening From ev'ry blast, We'll face undaunted Life's wintriest weather, And fall together, Love-linked, at last. ROSE AND RUE I was a maiden fair and fond, Smiling, singing all the day; Till Maguire, with looks of fire, He stole my heart away. The gard'ner's son as he stood by Blossoms four did give to me: The pink, the rue, the violet blue, And the red, red rosy tree. Lass, for your lips the sweet clove pink, For your eyes the violets blue; The rose to speak your damask cheek, For memory the rue. Oh, but my love at first was fond, Now, alas, he's turned untrue, My rose and pink and violet shrink, But tears keep fresh my rue. THE FALLING STAR On my heaven he flashed, as the meteor star Out of night will flame from afar Ah! how could I escape his spell? Deep, deep into my heart he fell Ochone! I believed the stars that burn above Shone less true than his eyes of love. All their lamps beam on and on, But, my falling star, thou art gone. Ochone! And a new love claims my fealty now, Scant of speech and stern of brow. Until death I own his claim, Sorrow is my new love's name. Ochone! I ONCE LOVED A BOY I once loved a boy, and a bold Irish boy, Far away in the hills of the West; Ah! the love of that boy was my jewel of joy And I built him a bower in my breast, In my breast; And I built him a bower in my breast. I once loved a boy, and I trusted him true, And I built him a bower in my breast; But away, wirrasthrue! the rover he flew, And robbed my poor heart of its rest, Of its rest; And robbed my poor heart of its rest. The spring-time returns, and the sweet speckled thrush Murmurs soft to his mate on her nest, But forever there's fallen a sorrowful hush O'er the bower that I built in my breast, In my breast— O'er the desolate bower in my breast. THE WHITE BLOSSOM'S OFF THE BOG The white blossom's off the bog, and the leaves are off the trees, And the singing birds have scattered across the stormy seas; And, oh! 'tis winter, Wild, wild winter! With the lonesome wind sighing for ever through the trees. How green the leaves were springing! how glad the birds were singing! When I rested in the meadow with my head on Patrick's knees; And, oh! 'twas spring time, Sweet, sweet spring time! With the daisies all dancing before me in the breeze. With the spring the fresh leaves they'll laugh upon the trees, And the birds they'll flutter back with their songs across the seas, But I'll never rest again with my head on Patrick's knees; And for me 'twill be winter, All the year winter, With the lonesome wind sighing for ever through the trees. I MAYN'T OR I MAY And will I answer you, when you come again? And have you a chance or two? may be one in ten. And will I think of you, when you're far away? That's according to my humour, I just mayn't or I may. Do I feel more kind to you than I did before? We'll say inclined to you, p'r'aps a trifle more. Make up my mind to you? I can hardly guess. If I couldn't, sure I shouldn't, no nor wouldn't say Yes! And will I write to you, when you write to me? Give that delight to you? only wait and see. And will I think of you? may be now and then. But will you, won't you, will you, won't you soon be home again? COME, SIT DOWN BESIDE ME When first you came courting, My own heart's delight, I met you with sporting And saucy despite; And of other fine fellows I made you mad jealous, When first you came courting, My own heart's delight. In turn then you tried me, My own heart's delight, For coldly you eyed me, Or shrank from my sight; Or with Norah you chattered, Or Flora you flattered, Sitting close up beside me, You rogue, you were right! But sit down beside me, My own heart's delight, To comfort and guide me; I'm yours from to-night! I've teased and I've vexed you, I've pleased and perplexed you, But sit down beside me, We're one from to-night! OH, MY GRIEF! OH, MY GRIEF! Oh, my grief, oh, my grief! Oh, my grief all the morning! Oh, my grief all the even! Oh, my grief all the night! Over flower, over leaf Falls the shade of her scorning, And darkens blue heaven With its desolate blight. Oh, wind, and oh, wind Wailing over the forest, With thee my sad spirit Would fain wander forth! Thus all unconfined, When sorrow was sorest, I too should inherit The strange, silent North. More pure and more chaste, Thou desolate Norland, Than the South's sighing langours In bowers rose-hung, Thy wan, winter waste, Thy still, solemn foreland, Aurora's red angers The white stars among. MAUREEN, MAUREEN Oh! Maureen, Maureen, have you forgotten The fond confession that you made to me, While round us fluttered the white bog cotton, And o'er us waved the wild arbutus tree? Like bits of sky bo-peeping through the bower, No sooner were your blue eyes sought than flown, Till, white and fluttering as the cotton flower, Your slender hand it slipped into my own. Oh! Maureen, Maureen, do you remember The faithful promise that you pledged to me The night we parted in black December Beneath the tempest-tossed arbutus tree. When faster than the drops from heaven flowing, Your heavy tears they showered with ceaseless start; And wilder than the storm-wind round us blowing, Your bitter sobs they smote upon my heart? Oh! Maureen, Maureen, for your love only I left my father and mother dear; Within the churchyard they're lying lonely, 'Tis from their tombstone I've travelled here. Their only son, you sent me o'er the billow, Ochone! though kneeling they implored me stay; They sickened, with no child to smooth their pillow; They died. Are you as dead to me as they? Oh! Maureen, must then the love I bore you— Seven lonesome summers of longing trust— Turn like the fortune I've gathered for you, Like treacherous fairy treasure, all to dust! But, Maureen, bawn asthore, your proud lips quiver; Into your scornful eyes the tears they start; Your rebel hand returns to mine for ever; Oh! Maureen, Maureen, never more we'll part. IN REASON'S DESPITE Because when the moon shed a lustre divine, For one magical moment her spirit met mine; And to-day she went by With a laugh in her eye, Yet no soft look of promise, what quarrel have I? I might just as well blame a beautiful star For flashing her spell over earth from afar, And then speeding on through the shadowy night To some orb beyond ours her pure message of light. Or, because, when I've sought the Queen Rose on her throne A chance breeze has caught her sweet breath to my own, If that exquisite scent By the breeze is besprent For another's delight, shall I show discontent? Still in reason's despite, at my heart there's a hope, As frail yet as bright as the gossamer rope, That shall float up to thee from life's dull prison bars, My Rose of all roses, my Star of all stars! LOVE AT MY HEART Love at my heart came knocking! Ah! but with bitter mocking I said him No! Bowed and bade him go Far, far away, heigho! Ah! but when Love lay bleeding, Pity, to scorn succeeding, Turned cold disdain Into poignant pain, Till I too loved again. Now love despised is dearest, Now love neglected nearest; Now late and soon, Under sun and moon, O, heart o' mine, keep Love's tune! LOVE BALLADS THE ROSE-TREE IN FULL BEARING O rose-tree in full bearing, When rude storms had stripped the bowers, How oft, with thee despairing, I've sighed through the long dark hours! Till Spring, so hard of wooing, Hope's own green spell upon thee cast, And Kate, her coldness rueing, With sweet pity turned at last. Then April smiled to cheer us, Or mocked grief with golden rain, While Kate drew laughing near us, Or frowned past with dear disdain; 'Till, was it yester even?— Beneath thy faint red flowers divine, With Love's one star in heaven, Her lips leant at last to mine! And when I fondly told her, O Rose, all our stormy grief; And how my hope grew bolder With thy every opening leaf; She answered, “For so sharing, Dear heart, Love's weary winter hour, The Rose-tree in full bearing Shall build us our summer bower.” THE SAILOR'S BRIDE And is he coming home to-day Who all these years has ranged? And will he be the same to me, Although I so have changed. The same again, the same as when At first he courting came, And looked me through with eyes so blue— Ah, will he be the same? I would have dressed in all my best; He'd have me wear my worst— The faded gown of homespun brown In which I met him first. My woman's heart would have me smart; I'm but a woman still. Yet bide, gay gown, come, old one, down; Let Donal have his will. “The Southern Star” has fetched the Bar, She's signalled from the land. Quick, little Donal, to my arms! Now on my shoulder stand! There, there she sails! He's at the rails! For joy my eyes run o'er. Wave, little lad, to your own dad! Aye, 'tis himself once more. THE BLACKBIRD AND THE THRUSH (Adapted) One evening as I walkéd Down by a green bush, I heard two birds whistling, 'Twas the blackbird and thrush; I asked them the reason They were so merrie, And in answer they sang back to me, “We are single and free.” Next morning as that green bush I passed all alone, Two thrushes piped out of it, The blackbird was flown; I asked them the reason Their hearts were so gay, It was joyfully they answered me. “We have mated to-day.” One morrow little after That bush I went by, When o'er me most piteously I heard my thrush cry; I asked why such sorrow He poured from the tree, And he answered, “'Tis the blackbird Has my love stolen from me.” Oh, freedom it is pleasant, Love returned is delight! But a lover deserted Must mourn noon and night. Break my house, take my goods, I can gather fresh gain; But love's ruined bower Who shall build up again? FOR I HAD A SPIRIT ABOVE MY DEGREE With the lark up above, the Lent lilies below, Young Owen came courting, I could not say No! But because I was poor and of humble degree, His proud parents parted my Owen and me. Had he only stood firm. I'd have waited for years; But Owen gave way; so I forced back my tears, And wed Hugh O'Donnell, long hopeless of me, For I had a spirit above my degree. But the sweet old croonawns evermore, evermore, Owen whistled and sang as he went by our door; Yet I never looked out my old sweetheart to see; For I had a spirit above my degree. For comfort, for comfort, I cried and I prayed, Even while my sweet babe in my bosom was laid; But when in my face he laughed up from my knee, Sweet comfort, sweet comfort it came back to me. Till one day to a knock when I pushed back the pin, All dressed in his best, my poor Owen ran in, And “Oonagh, make haste, dear, make haste, dear,” cried he, “For the chapel's full up our fine wedding to see.” I looked in his eyes and I saw they were wild, With the sweet old croonawns his mood I beguiled, Till his heart-broken father came over the lea With the keepers and took him still crying for me. My good man is gone, but God has been kind; My sons they are steady, my girls of my mind; My prayers for my lost ones rise fervent and free, And between their two graves there's one waiting for me. MY GARDEN AT THE BACK When I came o'er from old Rosstrevor Here to London town, A lonesome spell upon me fell For Kate and County Down. 'Twas gloomy toil for her glad smile, Grey stone for grassy track; Till I took heart at last to start A garden at the back. With country mould, at morn and eve, Still I piled my plot; Then sow'd and set musk, mignonette, Pink, rose, forget-me-not. Till bees they flew from out the blue, And butterflies they'd tack, O blessed hour, from flow'r to flow'r Of my garden at the back. Then when I'd but the Christmas rose To end the flow'ry race, Around the corner came my scorner With a sadden'd face. The cause to guess of her distress For sure I was not slack, And now her eyes make Paradise Of my garden at the back. MY HEART'S IN INNISHOWEN (Adapted) The blackbird he was piping loud From off the lilac tree, And there was not a single cloud In all the North Countree. When down there stepped a bonny bride, Still sweeter than the Spring; And at Greencastle Ferryside 'Twas thus I heard her sing: “Oh, Magilligan 's a pretty place, And that full well is known; Yet I am going to leave you all And live in Innishowen; Where every maid goes neat and trig, Whatever her degree. For of all the parts of Ireland Sweet Innishowen for me! “And if you ask why I've forsook My lovely native strand, Then at my left third finger look And you will understand. For sure a maid must follow him Whose ring's upon it shown; So though my eyes for you are dim, My heart's in Innishowen!” THE SONG OF THE GHOST When all were dreaming but Pastheen Power, A light came streaming beneath her bower, A heavy foot at her door delayed, A heavy hand on the latch was laid. “Now who dare venture at this dark hour, Unbid to enter my maiden bower?” “Dear Pastheen, open the door to me, And your true lover you'll surely see.” “My own true lover, so tall and brave, Lives exiled over the angry wave.” “Your true love's body lies on the bier, His faithful spirit is with you here.” “His look was cheerful, his voice was gay; Your speech is fearful, your face is grey; And sad and sunken your eye of blue, But Patrick, Patrick, alas! 'tis you.” Ere dawn was breaking she heard below The two cocks shaking their wings to crow. “O hush you, hush you, both red and grey, Or you will hurry my love away.” “O! hush your crowing, both grey and red, Or he'll be going to join the dead; O cease from calling his ghost to the mould, And I'll come crowning your combs with gold.” When all were dreaming but Pastheen Power, A light went streaming from out her bower, And on the morrow when they awoke, They knew that sorrow her heart had broke. THE KERRY COW “O what are you seekin', my pretty colleen, So sadly, tell me now?” “O'er mountain and plain I'm seekin' in vain, Kind sir, for my Kerry cow.” “Is she black as the night, with a star of white Above her bonny brow? And as clever to clear the dykes as a deer?” “That's just my own Kerry cow.” “Then cast your eye into that field of wheat; She's there as large as life!” “My bitter disgrace! howe'er shall I face The farmer and his wife?” “Since the farmer's unwed, you've no cause for dread From his wife, you must allow; And for kisses three—'tis myself is he— The farmer will free your cow.” HEY HO, THE MORNING DEW (Adapted) My father bought at great expense A grand high stepping grey, But when he puts her at a fence She backs and backs away. Sing Hey ho, the morning dew! Hey ho, the rose and rue! Follow me, my bonny lad, For I'll not follow you! My mother bought a likely hen On last St. Martin's day: She clucks and clucks and clucks again, But never yet will lay. Sing Hey ho, the morning dew! Hey ho, the rose and rue! Follow me, my bonny lad, For I'll not follow you! O, Mustard is my brother's dog, Who whines and wags his tail, And snuffs into the market bag, But dar' not snatch the meal. Sing Hey ho, the morning dew! Hey ho, the rose and rue! Follow me, my bonny lad, For I'll not follow you! When walls lie down for steeds to step, When eggs themselves go lay, And the groats jump into Mustard's jaws, To you my court I'll pay! Sing Hey ho, the morning dew! Hey ho, the rose and rue! Follow me, my bonny lad, For I'll not follow you! THE BLACKBIRD AND THE WREN (Adapted) Once the blackbird called unto the solemn crow, “Oh, why do you for ever in mourning go?” Quoth the crow, “I lost my own true love, alack! And thereafter for ever I go all in black.” Then the blackbird sighed from out the sally bush, “Once I, too, fell courting a fair young thrush. Oh, but she deceived and grieved me, Oh, but she turned false, false O. And ever since in mourning I go!” Last the little wren he piped, “If we were men, We could find us sweethearts, eight, nine and ten. Then if one grew cold or turned unfaithful, O, It is off to another we each could go.” “Perhaps,” replied the crow, “that plan of yours might work If we were living in the land of the Turk. But the Colleens of Coleraine still are free to give us pain, And so, my friends, in feathers we'll remain.” THE STRATAGEM Who'd win a heart must learn the art To hide what he's about. When Kate I met, too soon I let My loving secret out. In vain I'd sigh, in vain I'd try Each trick of eye or speech; Advance, retire, neglect, admire, The rogue I could not reach. Then I grew warm and in a storm Against her out I blew, But she stood fast before my blast And raging I withdrew. Then I began a different plan; I went to Rose Maguire, Who'd had her scene with Con Mulqueen, And asked her to conspire. Says she, “Avick, we'll try the trick,” And so we shammed sweethearts, Till Con grew vexed and Kate perplexed, So well we played our parts: And when we found them turning round The very way we wanted, Our stratagem we owned to them And got our pardon granted. THE LITTLE RED LARK Oh, swan of slenderness, dove of tenderness, Jewel of joys, arise! The little red lark like a rosy spark Of song to his sunburst flies. But till thou art risen, earth is a prison Full of my lonesome sighs; Then awake and discover to thy fond lover The morn of thy matchless eyes. The dawn is dark to me; hark! oh, hark to me, Pulse of my heart, I pray! And out of thy hiding with blushes gliding, Dazzle me with thy day. Ah, then, once more to thee flying, I'll pour to thee Passion so sweet and gay, The lark shall listen and dewdrops glisten, Laughing on every spray. LULLABIES HUSH O! I would hush my lovely laddo, In the green arbutus' shadow, O'er the fragrant, flowering meadow, In the smiling spring-time. Shoheen sho lo, Shoheen hoo lo! I'd hush my boy beside the fountain, By the soothing, silvery fountain, On the pleasant, purple mountain, In the sultry summer. Shoheen sho lo, Shoheen hoo lo! I would smooth my darling's pillow, By the blue Atlantic billow, On the shores of Parknasilla, In the golden autumn. Shoheen sho lo, Shoheen hoo lo! I would soothe my child to slumber, By the rosy, rustling ember, Through the days of dark December, In the stormy winter. Shoheen sho lo, Shoheen hoo lo! May no cruel fairy charm thee! May no dread banshee alarm thee! Flood, nor fire, nor sickness harm thee! Winter, spring, and summer— Summer, autumn, winter, Shoheen sho lo, Shoheen hoo lo! THE HOOD HAMMOCK Though the way be long and weary Over mountain, under wood, Mother will never mind it, deary, With you hammocked in her hood. Hush! my honey! See, my sonny, How from off the Autumn trees Sparkling showers of fairy money Fall and flutter in the breeze! Hush! the Queen bee to her levee, Buzz-a-buzz! with humming sport, From the blossoms in a bevy Calls her golden glancing court. Hark! the cushats without number In the tree-tops o'er our track “Coo-a-coo!” to smiling slumber Coax the boyo on my back. Shoheen sho ho! lulla lo lo! Safe from sight and sound of harm, Dream till daddy lifts his laddy Laughing up upon his arm. Dream! Dream! UNDER THE ARBUTUS In the green arbutus shadow On the lovely banks of Loune, I would rock my laughing laddo In his cradle up and down; Up and down, and to and fro, Singing lulla, lulla lo! Soft cloud fleeces, floating o'er us, Curtain up the staring sun! Pretty birds, in loving chorus, Pipe around my precious one! Pipe your softest shoheen sho, Tirra lirra! lulla lo! See! the sky to brightest blossom Flowers within the furthest West, And the babe upon my bosom Flushes with the rose of rest; Whilst with magic light aglow Loune gives back my lulla lo! THE CRADLE OF GOLD I'd rock my own sweet Childie to rest In a cradle of gold on the bough of the willow, To the shoheen ho! of the Wind of the West And the lulla lo! of the blue sea billow. Sleep, baby dear! Sleep without fear! Mother is here beside your pillow. I'd put my own sweet Childie to float In a silver boat on the beautiful river, Where a shoheen! whisper the white cascades And a lulla lo! the green flags shiver. Sleep, baby dear! Sleep without fear! Mother is here with you for ever! Shoheen ho! to the rise and fall Of Mother's bosom, 'tis sleep has bound you! And oh, my Child, what cosier nest For rosier rest could love have found you? Sleep, baby dear! Sleep without fear! Mother's two arms are close around you! SONGS OF SPORT THE FOX HUNT (Adapted) The first morning of March in the year '33, There was frolic and fun in our own country: The King's County hunt over meadows and rocks, Most nobly set out in the search of a fox. Hullahoo! harkaway! hullahoo! harkaway! Hullahoo! harkaway, boys! away, harkaway! When they started bold Reynard he faced Tullamore, Through Wicklow and Arklow along the seashore; There he brisked up his brush with a laugh, and says he, “'Tis mighty refreshing, this breeze from the sea!” Hullahoo! harkaway! hullahoo! harkaway! Hullahoo! harkaway, boys! away, harkaway! With the hounds at his heels every inch of the way, He led us by sunset right into Roscrea; Here he ran up a chimney and out of the top, The rogue he cried out for the hunters to stop From their loud harkaway! hullahoo! harkaway! Hullahoo! harkaway, boys! away, harkaway! “'Twas a long thirsty stretch since we left the seashore, But, lads, here you've gallons of claret galore; Myself will make free just to slip out of view And take a small pull at my own mountain dew.” So no more hullahoo, hullahoo! harkaway! Hullahoo! harkaway, boys! away, harkaway! One hundred and twenty good sportsmen went down, And sought him from Ballyland into B'lyboyne; We swore that we'd watch him the length of the night, So Reynard, sly Reynard, lay hid till the light. Hullahoo! hullahoo! harkaway, harkaway! Hullahoo! harkaway, boys! away, harkaway! But the hills they re-echoed right early next morn With the cry of the hounds and the call of the horn, And in spite of his action, his craft, and his skill, Our fine fox was taken on top of the hill. Hullahoo! harkaway! hullahoo! harkaway! Hullahoo! harkaway, boys! away, harkaway! When Reynard he knew that his death was so nigh, For pen, ink, and paper he called with a sigh; And all his dear wishes on earth to fulfil, With these few dying words he declared his last will. While we ceased harkaway! hullahoo! harkaway! Hullahoo! harkaway, boys! away, harkaway! “Here's to you, Mr. Casey, my Curraghmore estate, And to you, young O'Brien, my money and plate, And to you, Thomas Dennihy, my whip, spurs and cap, For no leap was so cross that you'd look for a gap.” And of what he made mention they found it no blank, For he gave them a cheque on the National Bank. THE IRISH REEL While ould Phelim o'er his fiddle Flourishes his famous bow, Lad and lass along the middle All salute and rank in row. “Are yez full arranged and ready?” “Ready, Phelim, heart and heel!” “Off then, all!” and, smart and steady, Twenty couple step the reel. Whisper, Phelim, from the fairies Underneath the midnight moon Leadin' up their light vagaries Have you stole that lovely tune? Since each dancer's foot it follows Up and down the magic chime, For the world like slender swallows Racin' in the meadow rime. At the double, at the treble, How the lads they leap and slide, Whilst the women wid their skimmin' Teach the very swans to glide. Glancin' shyly, blushin' coyly, Arm to waist, around we wheel, Boys, between us all and Venus, What could best our Irish Reel? At the double, at the treble, We go dancin', heart and heel. Boys, between us all and Venus, What could best our Irish Reel? THE KILLARNEY HUNT The hunt is up! and hound and pup Are tunin' round Killarney; The hunt is out! O there's a shout! You'd hear it down to Blarney. There goes the stag along the crag, A Royal now, I warrant, See how he sails across the rails And flies the foaming torrent. Away to Tork they wind and work, Among the whorts and heather. The scent's in doubt, now all are out, Now, hark! they're all together. For old Jack Keogh he marked him go And waved 'em with his wattle. A full George crown they've thrown him down, With that he'll moist his throttle. A fine view spot up here we've got, A fine mixed lot within it. Like ould No'hs Ark, above the Park We're packed this blessed minute. The Parson's pasted to the Priest, The farmer to the flunkey, Between the fool upon his mule, The cripple on his donkey. Yoicks! tally ho! now off they go! See, there the stag is skimmin'! He's through the brake, he's in the lake, And after him they're swimmin'. Their floatin' ranks are on his flanks, They're closin' now behind him; He feels the land! he's up the strand! Now mind him! oh, now mind him! Hul-hullahoo! they flash in view Along the shinin' shingle, In lengthenin' row they streamin' go, Now with the shades they mingle; While underneath the evening star A phantom hunt seems flyin', Now swelling near, now falling far, Now down the darkness dyin'. SONGS OF OCCUPATION HERRING IS KING Let all the fish that swim the sea, Salmon and turbot, cod and ling, Bow down the head, and bend the knee To herring, their king! to herring, their king! Sing, Hugamar féin an sowra lin', 'Tis we have brought the summer in. The sun sank down so round and red Upon the bay, upon the bay; The sails shook idle overhead, Becalmed we lay, becalmed we lay; Sing, Hugamar féin an sowra lin', 'Tis we have brought the summer in. Till Shawn, The Eagle, dropped on deck— The bright-eyed boy, the bright-eyed boy; 'Tis he has spied your silver track, Herring, our joy—herring, our joy; Sing, Hugamar féin an sowra lin', 'Tis we have brought the summer in. It was in with the sails and away to shore, With the rise and swing, the rise and swing Of two stout lads at each smoking oar, After herring, our king—herring, our king; Sing, Hugamar féin an sowra lin', 'Tis we have brought the summer in. The Manx and the Cornish raised the shout, And joined the chase, and joined the chase; But their fleets they fouled as they went about, And we won the race, we won the race; Sing, Hugamar féin an sowra lin', 'Tis we have brought the summer in. For we turned and faced you full to land, Down the góleen long, and góleen long, And, after you, slipped from strand to strand Our nets so strong, our nets so strong; Sing, Hugamar féin an sowra lin', 'Tis we have brought the summer in. Then we called to our sweethearts and our wives, “Come welcome us home, welcome us home!” Till they ran to meet us for their lives Into the foam, into the foam; Sing, Hugamar féin an sowra lin', Tis we have brought the summer in. O the kissing of hands and waving of caps From girl and boy, from girl and boy, While you leapt by scores in the lasses' laps, Herring, our pride and joy; Sing, Hugamar féin an sowra lin', 'Tis we have brought the summer in. THE RIDDLE A Loobeen The Girls— Raise us a riddle as spinning we sit. Bride— P'r'aps I have one that your fancy will fit. The Girls— Come, then, advance it with all of your wit. Bride— Some have got the barley showin', Some a purty patch of oats, Others just the pratees growin', With a mountain side for goats. Come with me through meadows flow'ry Up where furze and heather blow, If my secret golden dowry, Lasses, you would like to know. A Girl— Surely hid treasure is in your head. Bride— Wrongly my riddle this time you have read. The Girls— Come, give us hold of a stronger thread. Bride— How is this my herds can utter Of themselves the milk all day, Churn and turn it into butter, Faix! and firkin it safe away. Kerry cows upon their brows Bear a pair of branching horns; But my kind they wear behind Only one, like Unicorns. A Girl— Ah, then, your herds are the bees on the height. Bride— 'Deed and this time you've guessed aright. The Girls— Pleasant the riddle you put us to-night. JACK, THE JOLLY PLOUGHBOY (Adapted) As Jack the jolly ploughboy was ploughing through his land, He turned his share and shouted to bid his horses stand, Then down beside his team he sat, contented as a king, And Jack he sang his song so sweet he made the mountains ring With his Ta-ran-nan nanty na! Sing Ta-ran-nan nanty na! While the mountains all ringing re-echoed the singing Of Ta-ran-nan nanty na! 'Tis said old England's sailors, when wintry tempests roar, Will plough the stormy waters, and pray for those on shore; But through the angry winter the share, the share for me, To drive a steady furrow, and pray for those at sea. With my Ta-ran-nan nanty na! &amp;c. When heaven above is bluest, and earth most green below, Away from wife and sweetheart the fisherman must go; But golden seed I'll scatter beside the girl I love, And smile to hear the cuckoo, and sigh to hear the dove. With my Ta-ran-nan nanty na! &amp;c. 'Tis oft the hardy fishers a scanty harvest earn, And gallant tars from glory on wooden legs return, But a bursting crop for ever shall dance before my flail; For I'll live and die a farmer all in the Golden Vale. With my Ta-ran-nan nanty na! Sing Ta-ran-nan nanty na! While the mountains all ringing re-echo the singing Of my Ta-ran-nan nanty na! SPINNING-WHEEL SONG Once my wheel ran cheerily round, Ran cheerily round from day to day, But now it drags how wearily round; For Owen's gone away. Once I spun soft carolling O, Soft carolling O! from morn to eve, But since we started quarrelling, oh! 'Tis silently I weave. Has he joined Sir Arthur, ochone! Sir Arthur, ochone! to fight the French? Though he was rude, I'd rather, ochone! He joined me on this bench. Hush! he's been deluthering you, Deluthering you with swords and drums, And now I think 'tis soothering you, 'Tis soothering you, he comes. THE SONG OF THE PRATEE When, after the Winter alarmin', The Spring steps in so charmin', So fresh and arch In the middle of March, Wid her hand St. Patrick's arm on; Let us all, let us all be goin', Agra, to assist at your sowin', The girls to spread Your iligant bed, And the boys to set the hoe in. Then good speed to your seed! God's grace and increase. Never more in our need may you blacken wid the blight; But when Summer is o'er, in our gardens, astore, May the fruit at your root fill our bosoms wid delight. So rest and sleep, my jewel, Safe from the tempest cruel; Till violets spring And skylarks sing From Mourne to Carran Tual. Then wake and build your bower Through April sun and shower, To bless the earth That gave you birth, Through many a sultry hour. Then good luck to your leaf. And ochone, ologone, Never more to our grief may it blacken wid the blight, But when Summer is o'er, in our gardens, astore, May the fruit at your root fill our bosoms wid delight. Thus smile with glad increasin', Till to St. John we're raisin' Through Erin's isle The pleasant pile That sets the bonfire blazin'. O 'tis then that the Midsummer fairy, Abroad on his sly vagary, Wid purple and white, As he passes by night, Your emerald leaf shall vary. Then more power to your flower, and your merry green leaf! Never more to our grief may they blacken wid the blight; But when Summer is o'er, in our gardens, astore, May the fruit at your root fill our bosoms wid delight. And once again, Mavourneen, Some mellow Autumn mornin', At red sunrise Both girls and boys To your garden ridge we're turnin', Then under your foliage fadin' Each man of us sets his spade in, While the colleen bawn Her brown kishane Full up wid your fruit is ladin'. Then good luck to your leaf! More power to your flower! Never more to our grief may they blacken wid the blight; But when Summer is o'er, in our gardens, astore, May the fruit at your root fill our bosoms wid delight. THE PLOUGHMAN'S WHISTLE O'er thistle, darnel, dock, With straining flank and hock, Our handsome honest horses They keep to their courses As constant as the chapel clock, O! And straight as curraghs glide Across the crystal tide, Our plough, our plough we guide, A-fluting, merrily fluting, O! And while the wholesome soil Heaves up beneath our toil, Like sudden airy arrows, See, see how the sparrows And finches pounce upon their spoil, O! While rook and starling shy, Hang flutt'ring in the sky, Afeard till we go by, Afluting, merrily fluting, O! Let others care their kine, The ploughman's lot be mine, Through good and ill to follow The share's faugh-a-balleach, And never cut one crooked line, O! Old time may dip his plough Still deeper in my brow, But cheerfully as now I'll flute, I'll flute my carol, O! THE MILL SONG Corn is a-sowing Over the hill, The stream is a-flowing, Round goes the mill. Winding and grinding, Round goes the mill; Winding and grinding Should never stand still. The hands that are strongest Are welcome here, And those that work longest Earn the best cheer. The green corn is hinting Over the hill, Lasses tormenting The lads to their fill. Winding and grinding, &amp;c. The gold corn is glinting Over the hill; Lasses consenting, Lads have their will. Winding and grinding, &amp;c. Corn is a-carrying Into the mill; Young folk are marrying Over the hill. Winding and grinding, &amp;c. From the hands of the shaker Again goes the corn, The old to God's acre Gently are borne. Winding and grinding, &amp;c. The green corn is glistening Once more with the spring; Children are christening, Glad mothers sing. Winding and grinding, &amp;c. Thus our life runs around, Like the mill with its corn. Young folk are marrying, Old folk are burying, Young folk are born. Winding and grinding, Round goes the mill; Winding and grinding Should never stand still. The hands that are strongest Are welcome here, And they that work longest Earn the best cheer. THE OLD COUNTRY SWEET ISLE Sweet Isle, O how our hearts upleap Once more to mark thee mount the deep, Unfolding still to greet our gaze Haunt after haunt of blessed by-gone days. Blue hill-sides oft in boyhood climbed, Lanes where we courted, roamed and rhymed, Our hurling green, our dancing ground, Each dear old cottage ranging round. And now, sweet Isle, we near thy shore; Young hands wave welcome, old eyes run o'er; Till loving arms at long, long last Have fondly folded their exile fast! THE CUCKOO MADRIGAL Cuckoo! cuckoo! Our joyful rover, At last you're over The Ocean blue, And once again All ears shall listen, All eyes shall glisten At your glad strain, O yellow-throated, Mellow-noted Minstrel! Cuckoo! cuckoo! 'Twas only sorrow Made dark each morrow The winter through; And till your voice Awoke to cheer us, None, none came near us To cry “Rejoice!” O yellow-throated, Mellow-noted Minstrel! Cuckoo! cuckoo! How lad and maiden Love ambuscading In search of you! But far and near Ventriloquising, With art surprising You mock the ear; Till, airy elf, 'Tis Echo's self They call you. Cuckoo! cuckoo! At dawn upspringing, We hear you ringing Your joy-bell true. The livelong day, Its magic measure Peals perfect pleasure, Then dies away, In far off whispers Thro' our vespers Stealing. O BLESSED HOUR The frowning winter's past, O blessed, blessed hour! And leaves of hope at last Laugh out from bank and bower. The thorn that darkly sighed Is decked in bridal May, The sullen, sweeping tide Runs sparkling on its way, And bonny birds Their loving words Pipe forth from spray to spray. The meadows, long so dumb Beneath the aching frost, With bees are all a-hum, With cowslips all embossed And butterflies they glance From nodding flower to flower To join the jewel dance; O blessed, blessed hour! While pairing birds Their warbled words Through all the woodland shower. THE LIMERICK LASSES At every pleasant party, Whoe'er the host, he gave a toast, When we were young and hearty, That ever pleased us lads the most. 'Twas—“Friends, fill up your glasses Until they brim and bubble o'er, Here's to our Limerick lasses! Of Womanhood the cream and core.” Ere long we heard from Mar's field The mighty battle trumpet blown. And off with gallant Sarsfield “Wild Geese” we all to France were flown— Attacked and then attacking, The one brigade no foe could break, And ever bivouacking On fresh fields won for Ireland's sake, With “Comrades, charge your glasses Until they brim and bubble o'er; Here's our own Limerick lasses! Of Womankind the cream and core.” And now we're back from glory, Huzzaing into Limerick town— Each soldier tells his story And with his sweetheart settles down; For all the sighs and glances Of donna or of demoiselle Ne'er fooled away our fancies From those we've loved so long and well. Then, boys, fill up your glasses Until they're brimming o'er and o'er, Here's to our Limerick lasses! With three times three and one cheer more. THE BEAUTIFUL CITY OF SLIGO We may tramp the earth for all that we're worth, But what odds where you and I go? We shall never meet a spot so sweet As the beautiful City of Sligo. Oh, sure she's a Queen in purple and green, As she shimmers and glimmers her gardens between; And away to Lough Lene the like isn't seen Of her river a-quiver with shadow and sheen, The beautiful City of Sligo. Though bustle and noise are some folks' joys, Your London just gives me ver-ti-go; You can hear yourself talk when out you walk Thro' the beautiful City of Sligo. Oh, sure she's a Queen in purple and green, As she shimmers and glimmers her gardens between; And away to Lough Lene the like isn't seen Of her river a-quiver with shadow and sheen, The beautiful City of Sligo. As an artist in stones a genius was Jones, Whom so queerly they christened In-i-go, But he hadn't the skill to carve a Grass Hill For the beautiful City of Sligo. Oh, sure she's a Queen in purple and green, As she shimmers and glimmers her gardens between; And away to Lough Lene the like isn't seen Of her river a-quiver with shadow and sheen, The beautiful City of Sligo. Then for powder and puff and cosmetical stuff, Dear girls, to Dame Fashion, ah! why go? When Dame Nature supplies for tresses and eyes Such superior dyes down in Sligo. Oh, sure she's a Queen in purple and green, As she shimmers and glimmers her gardens between; And away to Lough Lene the like isn't seen Of her river a-quiver with shadow and sheen, The beautiful City of Sligo MY BLACKBIRD AND I (Suggested by a touching episode in the late Michael Davitt's life in Portland Gaol in 1881, recorded by him in his Leaves from a Prison Diary.) When first you came to me, And so little you knew me That from me you struggled With wild beating breast, Red sun-rays up-jetting On fire seemed setting The wavering woodland Where once was your nest— Then, my own dawny blackbird, The tears my eyes blinded, As my heart was reminded How, a child, long ago With strangers I shivered, While the cruel flames quivered Through our kindly old roof-tree In lovely Mayo. That thought, trembling blackbird, To my bosom endeared you, And ever I cheered you Till so friendly we grew That together we'd forage At the one plate of porridge, And from out the same pitcher Be both sipping too. Then so sweetly you'd chuckle From off of my knuckle, That, my tired eyes closing To drink in the sound, By its glad spell uplifted From my sad cell I drifted To the joyful enchantment Of green Irish ground. Now below, blessed hour! Even my grey prison's bower Is laughing with flower In the eye of the sun; Rude cliffs throw soft shadows On green ocean meadows, And the homesteads of free men Shine out one by one. O who could keep captives In solitude pining, With such a sun shining, Such bliss in the blue? I lingered and lingered, And then trembling-fingered I opened your cage door, And from me you flew. THE EXILES O! if for ev'ry tender tear That from our aching exiled eyes Has fallen for you, Erin dear, Our own loved Shamrocks could arise, They'd weave and weave a garland green, To stretch the cruel ocean through, All, all the weary way between Our yearning Irish hearts and you. And oh! if ev'ry patriot prayer, Put forth for your sad sake to God, Could in one cloud of incense rare Be lifted o'er your lovely sod, That cloud would curtain all the skies That far and near your fairness cope, Until upon its arch of sighs There beamed Heav'ns rainbow smile of hope.</field>
