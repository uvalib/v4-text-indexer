      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. ENGLAND AND SPAIN; AND WALLACE'S INVOCATION TO BRUCE. ENGLAND AND SPAIN; Written at the age of fourteen. OR, VALOUR AND PATRIOTISM. ?“His sword the brave man draws, And asks no omen but his country's cause.” —Pope. Too long have Tyranny and Power combined, To sway, with iron sceptre, o'er mankind; Long has Oppression worn th' imperial robe, And Rapine's sword has wasted half the globe! O'er Europe's cultured realms, and climes afar, Triumphant Gaul has pour'd the tide of war: To her fair Austria veil'd the standard bright; Ausonia's lovely plains have own'd her might; While Prussia's eagle, never taught to yield, Forsook her tow'ring height on Jena's field! Oh! gallant Frederie! could thy parted shade Have seen thy country vanquish'd and betray'd; How had thy soul indignant mourn'd her shame, Her sullied trophies, and her tarnish'd fame! When Valour wept lamented Brunswick's doom, And nursed with tears the laurels on his tomb; When Prussia, drooping o'er her hero's grave, Invoked his spirit to descend and save; Then set her glories—then expir'd her sun, And fraud achieved e'en more than conquest won! O'er peaceful realms, that smiled with plenty gay, Has desolation spread her ample sway; Thy blast, oh Ruin! on tremendous wings, Has proudly swept o'er empires, nations, kings! Thus the wild hurricane's impetuous force, With dark destruction marks its whelming course, Despoils the woodland's pomp, the blooming plain, Death on its pinion, vengeance in its train! Rise, Freedom, rise! and, breaking from thy trance, Wave the dread banner, seize the glitt'ring lance! With arm of might assert thy sacred cause, And call thy champions to defend thy laws! How long shall tyrant power her throne maintain? How long shall despots and usurpers reign? Is honour's lofty soul for ever fled? Is virtue lost? is martial ardour dead? Is there no heart where worth and valour dwell, No patriot Wallace, no undaunted Tell? Yes, Freedom, yes! thy sons, a noble band, Around thy banner, firm, exulting stand; Once more, 'tis thine, invincible, to wield The beamy spear and adamantine shield! Again thy cheek with proud resentment glows, Again thy lion-glance appals thy foes; Thy kindling eye-beam darts unconquer'd fires, Thy look sublime the warrior's heart inspires; And, while to guard thy standard and thy right, Castilians rush, intrepid, to the fight, Lo! Britain's gen'rous host their aid supply, Resolved for thee to triumph or to die! And Glory smiles to see Iberia's name Enroll'd with Albion's in the book of fame! Illustrious names! still, still united beam, Be still the hero's boast, the poet's theme: So, when two radiant gems together shine, And in one wreath their lucid light combine; Each, as it sparkles with transcendant rays, Adds to the lustre of its kindred blaze. Descend, oh Genius! from thy orb descend! Thy glowing thought, thy kindling spirit lend! As Memnon's harp (so ancient fables say) With sweet vibration meets the morning ray, So let the chords thy heavenly presence own, And swell a louder note, a nobler tone; Call from the sun, her burning throne on high, The seraph Ecstasy, with lightning eye; Steal from the source of day empyreal fire, And breathe the soul of rapture o'er the lyre! Hail, Albion! hail, thou land of freedom's birth! Pride of the main, and Phœnix of the earth! Thou second Rome, where mercy, justice, dwell, Whose sons in wisdom as in arms excel! Thine are the dauntless bands, like Spartans brave, Bold in the field, triumphant on the wave; In classic elegance, and arts divine, To rival Athens' fairest palm is thine; For taste and fancy from Hymettus fly, And richer bloom beneath thy varying sky, Where Science mounts in radiant car sublime, To other worlds beyond the sphere of time! Hail, Albion, hail! to thee has fate denied Peruvian mines and rich Hindostan's pride; The gems that Ormuz and Golconda boast, And all the wealth of Montezuma's coast: For thee no Parian marbles brightly shine; No glowing suns mature the blushing vine; No light Arabian gales their wings expand, To waft Sabæan incense o'er the land; No graceful cedars crown thy lofty hills, No trickling myrrh for thee its balm distils; Not from thy trees the lucid amber flows, And far from thee the scented cassia blows: Yet fearless Commerce, pillar of thy throne, Makes all the wealth of foreign climes thy own; From Lapland's shore to Afric's fervid reign, She bids thy ensigns float above the main; Unfurls her streamers to the fav'ring gale, And shows to other worlds her daring sail: Then wafts their gold, their varied stores to thee, Queen of the trident! empress of the sea! For this thy noble sons have spread alarms, And bade the zones resound with Britain's arms! Calpè's proud rock, and Syria's palmy shore, Have heard and trembled at their battle's roar; The sacred waves of fertilizing Nile Have seen the triumphs of the conquering isle; For this, for this, the Samiel-blast of war Has roll'd o'er Vincent's cape and Trafalgar! Victorious Rodney spread thy thunder's sound, And Nelson fell, with fame immortal crown'd; Blest if their perils and their blood could gain, To grace thy hand—the sceptre of the main! The milder emblems of the virtues calm, The poet's verdant bay, the sage's palm; These in thy laurel's blooming foliage twine, And round thy brows a deathless wreath combine: Not Mincio's banks, nor Meles' classic tide, Are hallow'd more than Avon's haunted side; Nor is thy Thames a less inspiring theme, Than pure Ilissus, or than Tiber's stream. Bright in the annals of th' impartial page, Britannia's heroes live from age to age! From ancient days, when dwelt her savage race, Her painted natives, foremost in the chase, Free from all cares for luxury or gain, Lords of the wood and monarchs of the plain; To these Augustan days, when social arts, Refine and meliorate her manly hearts; From doubtful Arthur, hero of romance, King of the circled board, the spear, the lance; To those whose recent trophies grace her shield, The gallant victors of Vimiera's field; Still have her warriors borne th' unfading crown, And made the British flag the ensign of renown. Spirit of Alfred! patriot soul sublime! Thou morning-star of error's darkest time! Prince of the lion-heart! whose arm in fight, On Syria's plains repell'd Saladin's might! Edward! for bright heroic deeds revered, By Cressy's fame to Britain still endear'd! Triumphant Henry! thou, whose valour proud, The lofty plume of crested Gallia bow'd! Look down, look down, exalted shades! and view Your Albion still to freedom's banner true! Behold the land, ennobled by your fame, Supreme in glory, and of spotless name; And, as the pyramid indignant rears Its awful head, and mocks the waste of years; See her secure in pride of virtue tower, While prostrate nations kiss the rod of power! Lo! where her pennons, waving high, aspire, Bold victory hovers near, “with eyes of fire!” While Lusitania hails, with just applause, The brave defenders of her injured cause; Bids the full song, the note of triumph rise, And swells th' exulting pæan to the skies! And they, who late with anguish, hard to tell, Breathed to their cherish'd realms a sad farewell! Who, as the vessel bore them o'er the tide, Still fondly linger'd on its deck, and sigh'd; Gazed on the shore, till tears obscured their sight, And the blue distance melted into light; The Royal exiles, forced by Gallia's hate To fly for refuge in a foreign state: They, soon returning o'er the western main, Ere long may view their clime beloved again; And, as the blazing pillar led the host Of faithful Israel, o'er the desert coast; So may Britannia guide the noble band, O'er the wild ocean, to their native land. Oh, glorious isle!—oh, sov'reign of the waves! Thine are the sons who “never will be slaves!” See them once more, with ardent hearts advance, And rend the laurels of insulting France; To brave Castile their potent aid supply, And wave, O Freedom! wave thy sword on high! Is there no bard of heavenly power possess'd, To thrill, to rouse, to animate the breast? Like Shakspeare o'er the secret mind to sway, And call each wayward passion to obey? Is there no bard, imbued with hallow'd fire, To wake the chords of Ossian's magic lyre; Whose numbers breathing all his flame divine, The patriot's name to ages might consign? Rise! Inspiration! rise, be this thy theme, And mount, like Uriel, on the golden beam! Oh, could my muse on seraph pinion spring, And sweep with rapture's hand the trembling string! Could she the bosom energies control, And pour impassion'd fervour o'er the soul! Oh, could she strike the harp to Milton given, Brought by a cherub from th' empyrean heaven! Ah, fruitless wish! ah, prayer preferr'd in vain, For her—the humblest of the woodland train; Yet shall her feeble voice essay to raise The hymn of liberty, the song of praise! Iberian bands! whose noble ardour glows, To pour confusion on oppressive foes; Intrepid spirits, hail! 'tis yours to feel The hero's fire, the freeman's godlike zeal! Not to secure dominion's boundless reign, Ye wave the flag of conquest o'er the slain; No cruel rapine leads you to the war, Nor mad ambition, whirl'd in crimson car; No, brave Castilians! yours a nobler end, Your land, your laws, your monarch to defend! For these, for these, your valiant legions rear The floating standard, and the lofty spear! The fearless lover wields the conquering sword, Fired by the image of the maid adored! His best beloved, his fondest ties, to aid, The father's hand unsheaths the glitt'ring blade! For each, for all, for ev'ry sacred right, The daring patriot mingles in the fight! And e'en if love or friendship fail to warm, His country's name alone can nerve his dauntless arm! He bleeds! he falls! his death-bed is the field! His dirge the trumpet, and his bier the shield! His closing eyes the beam of valour speak, The flush of ardour lingers on his cheek; Serene he lifts to heaven those closing eyes, Then for his country breathes a prayer—and dies! Oh! ever hallow'd be his verdant grave, There let the laurel spread, the cypress wave! Thou, lovely Spring! bestow, to grace his tomb, Thy sweetest fragrance, and thy earliest bloom; There let the tears of heaven descend in balm, There let the poet consecrate his palm! Let honour, pity, bless the holy ground, And shades of sainted heroes watch around! 'Twas thus, while Glory rung his thrilling knell, Thy chief, oh Thebes! at Mantinea fell; Smiled undismay'd within the arms of death, While Victory, weeping nigh, received his breath! Oh! thou, the sovereign of the noble soul! Thou source of energies beyond control! Queen of the lofty thought, the gen'rous deed, Whose sons unconquer'd fight, undaunted bleed,— Inspiring Liberty! thy worshipp'd name The warm enthusiast kindles to a flame; Thy charms inspire him to achievements high, Thy look of heaven, thy voice of harmony; More blest, with thee to tread perennial snows, Where ne'er a flower expands, a zephyr blows; Where Winter, binding nature in his chain, In frost-work palace holds perpetual reign; Than, far from thee, with frolic step to rove The green savannas and the spicy grove; Scent the rich balm of India's perfumed gales, In citron-woods and aromatic vales: For, oh! fair Liberty, when thou art near, Elysium blossoms in the desert drear! Where'er thy smile its magic power bestows, There arts and taste expand, there fancy glows; The sacred lyre its wild enchantment gives, And every chord to swelling transport lives; There ardent Genius bids the pencil trace The soul of beauty, and the lines of grace; With bold, Promethean hand, the canvass warms, And calls from stone expression's breathing forms. Thus, where the fruitful Nile o'erflows its bound, Its genial waves diffuse abundance round, Bid Ceres laugh o'er waste and sterile sands, And rich profusion clothe deserted lands. Immortal Freedom! daughter of the skies! To thee shall Britain's grateful incense rise. Ne'er, goddess! ne'er forsake thy fav'rite isle, Still be thy Albion brighten'd with thy smile! Long had thy spirit slept in dead repose, While proudly triumph'd thine insulting foes; Yet, though a cloud may veil Apollo's light, Soon, with celestial beam, he breaks to sight: Once more we see thy kindling soul return, Thy vestal-flame with added radiance burn; Lo! in Iberian hearts thine ardour lives, Lo! in Iberian hearts thy spark revives! Proceed, proceed, ye firm undaunted band! Still sure to conquer, if combined ye stand: Though myriads flashing in the eye of day, Stream'd o'er the smiling land in long array; Though tyrant Asia pour'd unnumber'd foes, Triumphant still the arm of Greece arose: For ev'ry state in sacred union stood, Strong to repel invasion's whelming flood; Each heart was glowing in the gen'ral cause, Each hand prepared to guard their hallow'd laws; Athenian valour join'd Laconia's might, And but contended to be first in fight; From rank to rank the warm contagion ran, And Hope and Freedom led the flaming van: Then Persia's monarch mourn'd his glories lost, As wild confusion wing'd his flying host; Then Attic bards the hymn of victory sung, The Grecian harp to notes exulting rung! Then Sculpture bade the Parian stone record The high achievements of the conquering sword. Thus, brave Castilians! thus, may bright renown And fair success your valiant efforts crown! Genius of chivalry! whose early days Tradition still recounts in artless lays; Whose faded splendours fancy oft recalls, The floating banners, and the lofty halls; The gallant feats thy festivals display'd, The tilt, the tournament, the long crusade; Whose ancient pride Romance delights to hail, In fabling numbers, or heroic tale: Those times are fled, when stern thy castles frown'd, Their stately towers with feudal grandeur crown'd; Those times are fled, when fair Iberia's clime Beheld thy Gothic reign, thy pomp sublime; And all thy glories, all thy deeds of yore, Live but in legends wild, and poet's lore. Lo! where thy silent harp neglected lies, Light o'er its chords the murm'ring zephyr sighs; Thy solemn courts, where once the minstrel sung, The choral voice of mirth and music rung; Now, with the ivy clad, forsaken, lone, Hear but the breeze and echo to its moan: Thy lonely tow'rs deserted fall away, Thy broken shield is mould'ring in decay. Yet, though thy transient pageantries are gone, Like fairy visions, bright, yet swiftly flown; Genius of chivalry! thy noble train, Thy firm, exalted virtues yet remain! Fair truth, array'd in robes of spotless white, Her eye a sunbeam, and her zone of light; Warm emulation, with aspiring aim, Still darting forward to the wreath of fame; And purest love, that waves his torch divine, At awful honour's consecrated shrine; Ardour, with eagle-wing and fiery glance; And gen'rous courage, resting on his lance; And loyalty, by perils unsubdued; Untainted faith, unshaken fortitude; And patriot energy, with heart of flame— These, in Iberia's sons are yet the same! These from remotest days their souls have fired, “Nerved ev'ry arm,” and ev'ry breast inspired! When Moorish bands their suffering land possess'd, And fierce oppression rear'd her giant crest; The wealthy caliphs on Cordova's throne, In eastern gems and purple splendour shone; Theirs was the proud magnificence that vied With stately Bagdat's oriental pride; Theirs were the courts in regal pomp array'd, Where arts and luxury their charms display'd; 'Twas theirs to rear the Zehrar's costly towers, Its fairy-palace and enchanted bowers; There all Arabian fiction e'er could tell, Of potent genii or of wizard spell; All that a poet's dream could picture bright, One sweet Elysium, charm'd the wond'ring sight! Too fair, to rich, for work of mortal hand, It seem'd an Eden from Armida's wand! Yet vain their pride, their wealth, and radiant state, When freedom waved on high the sword of fate! When brave Ramiro bade the despots fear, Stern retribution frowning on his spear; And fierce Almanzor, after many a fight, O'erwhelm'd with shame, confess'd the Christian's might. In later times the gallant Cid arose, Burning with zeal against his country's foes; His victor-arm Alphonso's throne maintain'd, His laureate brows the wreath of conquest gain'd; And still his deeds Castilian bards rehearse, Inspiring theme of patriotic verse! High in the temple of recording fame, Iberia points to great Gonsalvo's name; Victorious chief! whose valour still defied The arms of Gaul, and bow'd her crested pride; With splendid trophies graced his sov'reign's throne, And bade Granada's realms his prowess own. Nor were his deeds thy only boast, O Spain! In mighty Ferdinand's illustrious reign; 'Twas then thy glorious Pilot spread the sail, Unfurl'd his flag before the eastern gale; Bold, sanguine, fearless, ventured to explore Seas unexplored, and worlds unknown before. Fair science guided o'er the liquid realm, Sweet hope, exulting, steer'd the daring helm; While on the mast, with ardour-flashing eye, Courageous enterprise still hover'd nigh: The hoary genius of th' Atlantic main, Saw man invade his wide majestic reign; His empire, yet by mortal unsubdued, The throne, the world of awful solitude! And e'en when shipwreck seem'd to rear his form, And dark destruction menaced in the storm; In ev'ry shape, when giant-peril rose, To daunt his spirit and his course oppose; O'er ev'ry heart when terror sway'd alone, And hope forsook each bosom, but his own: Moved by no dangers, by no fears repell'd, His glorious track the gallant sailor held; Attentive still to mark the sea-birds lave, Or high in air their snowy pinions wave. Thus princely Jason, launching from the steep, With dauntless prow explored th' untravell'd deep; Thus, at the helm, Ulysses' watchful sight, View'd ev'ry star and planetary light. Sublime Columbus! when, at length, descried, The long-sought land arose above the tide; How ev'ry heart with exultation glow'd, How from each eye the tear of transport flow'd! Not wilder joy the sons of Israel knew, When Canaan's fertile plains appear'd in view. Then rose the choral anthem on the breeze, Then martial music floated o'er the seas; Their waving streamers to the sun display'd, In all the pride of warlike pomp array'd; Advancing nearer still, the ardent band Hail'd the glad shore, and bless'd the stranger land; Admired its palmy groves and prospects fair, With rapture breathed its pure ambrosial air: Then crowded round its free and simple race, Amazement pictured wild on ev'ry face; Who deem'd that beings of celestial birth, Sprung from the sun, descended to the earth— Then first another world, another sky, Beheld Iberia's banner blaze on high! Still prouder glories beam on history's page, Imperial Charles! to mark thy prosperous age: Those golden days of arts and fancy bright, When Science pour'd her mild, refulgent light; When Painting bade the glowing canvass breathe, Creative Sculpture claim'd the living wreath; When roved the Muses in Ausonian bowers, Weaving immortal crowns of fairest flowers; When angel-truth dispersed, with beam divine, The clouds that veil'd religion's hallow'd shrine; Those golden days beheld Iberia tower High on the pyramid of fame and power; Vain all the efforts of her numerous foes, Her might, superior still, triumphant rose. Thus, on proud Lebanon's exalted brow, The cedar, frowning o'er the plains below, Though storms assail, its regal pomp to rend, Majestic, still aspires, disdaining e'er to bend! When Gallia pour'd, to Pavia's trophied plain, Her youthful knights, a bold, impetuous train; When, after many a toil and danger past, The fatal morn of conflict rose at last; That morning saw her glittering host combine, And form in close array the threat'ning line; Fire in each eye, and force in ev'ry arm, With hope exulting, and with ardour warm; Saw to the gale their streaming ensigns play, Their armour flashing to the beam of day; Their gen'rous chargers panting, spurn the ground, Roused by the trumpet's animating sound; And heard in air their warlike music float, The martial pipe, the drum's inspiring note! Pale set the sun—the shades of evening fell, The mournful night-wind rung their funeral knell; And the same day beheld their warriors dead, Their sovereign captive, and their glories fled! Fled, like the lightning's evanescent fire, Bright, blazing, dreadful—only to expire! Then, then, while prostrate Gaul confess'd her might, Iberia's planet shed meridian light! Nor less, on famed St Quintin's deathful day, Castilian spirit bore the prize away; Laurels that still their verdure shall retain, And trophies beaming high in glory's fane! And lo! her heroes, warm with kindred flame, Still proudly emulate their fathers' fame; Still with the soul of patriot-valour glow, Still rush impetuous to repel the foe; Wave the bright faulchion, lift the beamy spear, And bid oppressive Gallia learn to fear! Be theirs, be theirs, unfading honour's crown, The living amaranths of bright renown! Be theirs th' inspiring tribute of applause, Due to the champions of their country's cause! Be theirs the purest bliss that virtue loves, The joy when conscience whispers and approves! When ev'ry heart is fired, each pulse beats high, To fight, to bleed, to fall, for liberty; When ev'ry hand is dauntless and prepared, The sacred charter of mankind to guard; When Britain's valiant sons their aid unite, Fervent and glowing still for freedom's right, Bid ancient enmities for ever cease, And ancient wrongs forgotten sleep in peace; When, firmly leagued, they join the patriot band, Can venal slaves their conquering arms withstand? Can fame refuse their gallant deeds to bless? Can victory fail to crown them with success? Look down, oh, Heaven! the righteous cause maintain, Defend the injured, and avenge the slain! Despot of France! destroyer of mankind! What spectre-cares must haunt thy sleepless mind! Oh! if at midnight round thy regal bed, When soothing visions fly thine aching head; When sleep denies thy anxious cares to calm, And lull thy senses in his opiate balm; Invoked by guilt, if airy phantoms rise, And murder'd victims bleed before thine eyes; Loud let them thunder in thy troubled ear, “Tyrant! the hour, th' avenging hour is near!” It is, it is! thy star withdraws its ray, Soon will its parting lustre fade away; Soon will Cimmerian shades obscure its light, And veil thy splendours in eternal night! Oh! when accusing conscience wakes thy soul, With awful terrors, and with dread control, Bids threat'ning forms, appalling, round thee stand, And summons all her visionary band; Calls up the parted shadows of the dead, And whispers, peace and happiness are fled; E'en at the time of silence and of rest, Paints the dire poniard menacing thy breast; Is then thy cheek with guilt and horror pale? Then dost thou tremble, does thy spirit fail? And wouldst thou yet by added crimes provoke The bolt of heaven to launch the fatal stroke? Bereave a nation of its rights revered, Of all to mortals sacred and endear'd? And shall they tamely liberty resign, The soul of life, the source of bliss divine? Can'st thou, supreme destroyer! hope to bind, In chains of adamant, the noble mind? Go, bid the rolling orbs thy mandate hear, Go, stay the lightning in its wing'd career! No, tyrant! no, thy utmost force is vain, The patriot-arm of freedom to restrain: Then bid thy subject-bands in armour shine, Then bid thy legions all their power combine! Yet could'st thou summon myriads at command, Did boundless realms obey thy scepter'd hand, E'en then her soul thy lawless might would spurn, E'en then, with kindling fire, with indignation burn! Ye sons of Albion! first in danger's field, The sword of Britain and of truth to wield! Still prompt the injured to defend and save, Appal the despot, and assist the brave; Who now intrepid lift the gen'rous blade, The cause of Justice and Castile to aid! Ye sons of Albion! by your country's name, Her crown of glory, her unsullied fame; Oh! by the shades of Cressy's martial dead, By warrior-bands, at Agincourt who bled; By honours gain'd on Blenheim's fatal plain, By those in Victory's arms at Minden slain; By the bright laurels Wolfe immortal won, Undaunted spirit! valour's fav'rite son! By Albion's thousand, thousand deeds sublime, Renown'd from zone to zone, from clime to clime; Ye British heroes! may your trophies raise A deathless monument to future days! Oh! may your courage still triumphant rise, Exalt the “lion banner” to the skies! Transcend the fairest names in hist'ry's page, The brightest actions of a former age; The reign of Freedom let your arms restore, And bid oppression fall—to rise no more! Then soon returning to your native isle, May love and beauty hail you with their smile; For you may conquest weave th' undying wreath, And fame and glory's voice the song of rapture breathe! Ah! when shall mad ambition cease to rage? Ah! when shall war his demon-wrath assuage? When, when, supplanting discord's iron reign, Shall mercy wave her olive-wand again? Not till the despot's dread career is closed, And might restrain'd and tyranny deposed! Return, sweet Peace, ethereal form benign! Fair blue-ey'd seraph! balmy power divine! Descend once more! thy hallow'd blessings bring, Wave thy bright locks, and spread thy downy wing! Luxuriant plenty laughing in thy train, Shall crown with glowing stores the desert-plain; Young smiling Hope, attendant on thy way, Shall gild thy path with mild celestial ray. Descend once more, thou daughter of the sky! Cheer ev'ry heart, and brighten ev'ry eye; Justice, thy harbinger, before thee send, Thy myrtle-sceptre o'er the globe extend: Thy cherub-look again shall soothe mankind; Thy cherub-hand the wounds of discord bind Thy smile of heaven shall ev'ry muse inspire, To thee the bard shall strike the silver lyre. Descend once more! to bid the world rejoice— Let nations hail thee with exulting voice; Around thy shrine with purest incense throng, Weave the fresh palm, and swell the choral song! Then shall the shepherd's flute, the woodland reed, The martial clarion and the drum succeed; Again shall bloom Arcadia's fairest flowers, And music warble in Idalian bowers. Where war and carnage blew the blast of death, The gale shall whisper with Favonian breath; And golden Ceres bless the festive swain, Where the wild combat redden'd o'er the plain. These are thy blessings, fair benignant maid! Return, return, in vest of light array'd! Let angel-forms and floating sylphids bear Thy car of sapphire through the realms of air, With accents milder than Æolian lays, When o'er the harp the fanning zephyr plays; Be thine to charm the raging world to rest, Diffusing round the heaven—that glows within thy breast! Oh, Thou! whose fiat lulls the storm asleep! Thou, at whose nod subsides the rolling deep! Whose awful word restrains the whirlwind's force, And stays the thunder in its vengeful course; Fountain of life! Omnipotent Supreme! Robed in perfection! crown'd with glory's beam! Oh! send on earth thy consecrated dove, To bear the sacred olive from above; Restore again the blest, the halcyon time, The festal harmony of nature's prime! Bid truth and justice once again appear, And spread their sunshine o'er this mundane sphere; Bright in their path, let wreaths unfading bloom, Transcendant light their hallow'd fane illume; Bid war and anarchy for ever cease, And kindred seraphs rear the shrine of peace; Brothers once more, let men her empire own, And realms and monarchs bend before the throne; While circling rays of angel-mercy shed Eternal haloes round her sainted head! WALLACE'S INVOCATION TO BRUCE. [ Advertisement. —“A Native of Edinburgh, and Member of the Highland Society of London,” with a view to give popularity to the project of rearing a suitable National Monument to the Memory of Wallace, lately offered Prizes for the three best poems on the subject of—that Illustrious Patriot inviting Bruce to the Scottish Throne. The following Poem obtained the first of these prizes. It would have appeared in the same form in which it is now offered to the Public, under the direction of its proper Editor, the giver of the Prize: but his privilege has, with pride as well as pleasure, been yielded to a Lady of the Author's own Country, who solicited permission to avail herself of this opportunity of honouring and further remunerating the genius of the Poet; and, at the same time, expressing her admiration of the theme in which she has triumphed. It is a noble feature in the character of a generous and enlightened people, that, in England, the memory of the patriots and martyrs of Scotland has long excited an interest not exceeded in strength by that which prevails in the country which boasts their birth, their deeds, and their sufferings.] “Great patriot hero! Ill requited chief!” The morn rose bright on scenes renown'd, Wild Caledonia's classic ground, Where the bold sons of other days Won their high fame in Ossian's lays, And fell—but not till Carron's tide With Roman blood was darkly dyed. The morn rose bright—and heard the cry Sent by exulting hosts on high, And saw the white-cross banner float (While rung each clansman's gathering note) O'er the dark plumes and serried spears Of Scotland's daring mountaineers; As, all elate with hope, they stood, To buy their freedom with their blood. The sunset shone—to guide the flying, And beam a farewell to the dying! The summer moon, on Falkirk's field, Streams upon eyes in slumber seal'd; Deep slumber—not to pass away When breaks another morning's ray, Nor vanish, when the trumpet's voice Bids ardent hearts again rejoice: What sunbeam's glow, what clarion's breath, May chase the still cold sleep of death? Shrouded in Scotland's blood-stain'd plaid, Low are her mountain-warriors laid; They fell, on that proud soil whose mould Was blent with heroes' dust of old, And, guarded by the free and brave, Yielded the Roman—but a grave! Nobly they fell; yet with them died The warrior's hope, the leader's pride. Vainly they fell—that martyr host— All, save the land's high soul, is lost. Blest are the slain! they calmly sleep, Nor hear their bleeding country weep! The shouts of England's triumph telling, Reach not their dark and silent dwelling; And those surviving to bequeath Their sons the choice of chains or death, May give the slumberer's lowly bier An envying glance—but not a tear. But thou, the fearless and the free, Devoted Knight of Ellerslie! No vassal-spirit, form'd to bow When storms are gathering, clouds thy brow; No shade of fear, or weak despair, Blends with indignant sorrow there! The ray which streams on yon red field, O'er Scotland's cloven helm and shield, Glitters not there alone, to shed Its cloudless beauty o'er the dead; But, where smooth Carron's rippling wave Flows near that deathbed of the brave, Illuming all the midnight scene, Sleeps brightly on thy lofty mien. But other beams, O Patriot! shine In each commanding glance of thine, And other light hath fill'd thine eye With inspiration's majesty, Caught from th' immortal flame divine, Which makes thine inmost heart a shrine! Thy voice a prophet's tone hath won, The grandeur Freedom lends her son; Thy bearing a resistless power, The ruling genius of the hour! And he, yon Chief, with mien of pride, Whom Carron's waves from thee divide, Whose haughty gesture fain would seek To veil the thoughts that blanch his cheek, Feels his reluctant mind controll'd By thine of more heroic mould; Though, struggling all in vain to war With that high soul's ascendant star, He, with a conqueror's scornful eye, Would mock the name of Liberty. Heard ye the Patriot's awful voice?— “Proud Victor! in thy fame rejoice! Hast thou not seen thy brethren slain, The harvest of thy battle plain, And bathed thy sword in blood, whose spot Eternity shall cancel not? Rejoice!—with sounds of wild lament, O'er her dark heaths and mountains sent, With dying moan, and dirge's wail, Thy ravaged country bids thee hail! Rejoice!—while yet exulting cries From England's conquering host arise, And strains of choral triumph tell, Her Royal Slave hath fought too well! Oh! dark the clouds of wo that rest, Brooding, o'er Scotland's mountain-crest; Her shield is cleft, her banner torn, O'er martyr'd chiefs her daughters mourn, And not a breeze, but wafts the sound Of wailing through the land around. Yet deem not thou, till life depart, High hope shall leave the patriot's heart; Or courage to the storm inured, Or stern resolve by woes matured, Oppose, to Fate's severest hour, Less than unconquerable power! No! though the orbs of heaven expire, Thine, Freedom! is a quenchless fire; And wo to him whose might would dare The energies of thy despair! No!—when thy chain, O Bruce! is cast O'er thy land's charter'd mountain-blast, Then in my yielding soul shall die The glorious faith of Liberty!” “Wild hopes! o'er dreamer's mind that rise!” With haughty laugh the Conqueror cries, (Yet his dark cheek is flush'd with shame, And his eye fill'd with troubled flame;) “Vain, brief illusions! doom'd to fly England's red path of victory! Is not her sword unmatch'd in might? Her course, a torrent in the fight? The terror of her name gone forth Wide o'er the regions of the north? Far hence, 'midst other heaths and snows, Must freedom's footstep now repose. And thou—in lofty dreams elate, Enthusiast! strive no more with Fate! 'Tis vain—the land is lost and won— Sheathed be the sword—its task is done. Where are the chiefs that stood with thee, First in the battles of the free? The firm in heart, in spirit high?— They sought yon fatal field to die. Each step of Edward's conquering host Hath left a grave on Scotland's coast.” “Vassal of England, yes! a grave Where sleep the faithful and the brave; And who the glory would resign, Of death like theirs, for life like thine? They slumber—and the stranger's tread May spurn thy country's noble dead; Yet, on the land they loved so well Still shall their burning spirit dwell, Their deeds shall hallow minstrel's theme, Their image rise on warrior's dream, Their names be inspiration's breath, Kindling high hope and scorn of death, Till bursts, immortal from the tomb, The flame that shall avenge their doom! This is no land for chains—away! O'er softer climes let tyrants sway; Think'st thou the mountain and the storm Their hardy sons for bondage form? Doth our stern wintry blast instil Submission to a despot's will? No! we were cast in other mould Than theirs by lawless power controll'd; The nurture of our bitter sky Calls forth resisting energy, And the wild fastnesses are ours, The rocks with their eternal towers; The soul to struggle and to dare, Is mingled with our northern air, And dust beneath our soil is lying Of those who died for fame undying. Tread'st thou that soil! and can it be, No loftier thought is roused in thee? Doth no high feeling proudly start From slumber in thine inmost heart? No secret voice thy bosom thrill, For thine own Scotland pleading still? Oh! wake thee yet—indignant, claim A nobler fate, a purer fame, And cast to earth thy fetters riven, And take thine offer'd crown from Heaven. Wake! in that high majestic lot May the dark past be all forgot; And Scotland shall forgive the field Where, with her blood, thy shame was seal'd. E'en I—though on that fatal plain Lies my heart's brother with the slain; Though reft of his heroic worth, My spirit dwells alone on earth; And when all other grief is past, Must this be cherish'd to the last— Will lead thy battles, guard thy throne, With faith unspotted as his own, Nor in thy noon of fame recall, Whose was the guilt that wrought his fall.” Still dost thou hear in stern disdain? Are Freedom's warning accents vain? No! royal Bruce! within thy breast Wakes each high thought, too long suppress'd. And thy heart's noblest feelings live, Blent in that suppliant word—“Forgive!” “Forgive the wrongs to Scotland done! Wallace! thy fairest palm is won; And, kindling at my country's shrine, My soul hath caught a spark from thine. Oh! deem not, in the proudest hour Of triumph and exulting power— Deem not the light of peace could find A home within my troubled mind. Conflicts by mortal eye unseen, Dark, silent, secret, there have been, Known but to Him whose glance can trace Thought to its deepest dwelling-place! —'Tis past—and on my native shore I tread, a rebel son no more. Too blest, if yet my lot may be, In glory's path to follow thee; If tears, by late repentance pour'd May lave the blood-stains from my sword!” Far other tears, O Wallace! rise From the heart's fountain to thine eyes; Bright, holy, and uncheck'd they spring, While thy voice falters, “Hail! my King! Be every wrong, by memory traced, In this full tide of joy effaced: Hail! and rejoice!—thy race shall claim A heritage of deathless fame, And Scotland shall arise, at length, Majestic in triumphant strength, An eagle of the rock, that won A way through tempests to the sun! Nor scorn the visions, wildly grand, The prophet-spirit of thy land: By torrent wave, in desert vast, Those visions o'er my thought have pass'd; Where mountain vapours darkly roll, That spirit hath possess'd my soul; And shadowy forms have met mine eye, The beings of futurity; And a deep voice of years to be, Hath told that Scotland shall be free! He comes! exult, thou Sire of Kings! From thee the chief, th' avenger springs! Far o'er the land he comes to save, His banners in their glory wave, And Albyn's thousand harps awake On hill and heath, by stream and lake, To swell the strains, that far around Bid the proud name of Bruce resound! And I—but wherefore now recall The whisper'd omens of my fall? They come not in mysterious gloom— There is no bondage in the tomb! O'er the soul's world no tyrant reigns, And earth alone for man hath chains! What though I perish ere the hour When Scotland's vengeance wakes in power? If shed for her, my blood shall stain The field or scaffold not in vain: Its voice to efforts more sublime Shall rouse the spirit of her clime; And in the noontide of her lot, My country shall forget me not!” Art thou forgot? and hath thy worth Without its glory pass'd from earth? Rest with the brave, whose names belong To the high sanctity of song, Charter'd our reverence to control, And traced in sunbeams on the soul, Thine, Wallace! while the heart hath still One pulse a generous thought can thrill— While youth's warm tears are yet the meed Of martyr's death, or hero's deed, Shall brightly live from age to age, Thy country's proudest heritage! 'Midst her green vales thy fame is dwelling, Thy deeds her mountain winds are telling, Thy memory speaks in torrent-wave, Thy step hath hallow'd rock and cave, And cold the wanderer's heart must be, That holds no converse there with thee! Yet, Scotland! to thy champion's shade, Still are thy grateful rites delay'd; From lands of old renown, o'erspread With proud memorials of the dead, The trophied urn, the breathing bust, The pillar guarding noble dust, The shrine where art and genius high Have laboured for eternity— The stranger comes—his eye explores The wilds of thy majestic shores, Yet vainly seeks one votive stone, Raised to the hero all thine own. Land of bright deeds and minstrel-lore! Withhold that guerdon now no more. On some bold height of awful form, Stern eyrie of the cloud and storm, Sublimely mingling with the skies, Bid the proud Cenotaph arise; Not to record the name that thrills Thy soul, the watch-word of thy hills; Not to assert, with needless claim, The bright for ever of its fame; But, in the ages yet untold, When ours shall be the days of old, To rouse high hearts and speak thy pride In him, for thee who lived and died.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. TALES AND HISTORIC SCENES THE ABENCERRAGE. CANTO I. “Le Maure ne se venge pas parce que sa colère dure encore, mais parce que la vengeance seule peut écarter de sa tête le poids d'infamie dont il est accablé.—Il se venge, parce qu'à ses yeux il n'y a qu'une ame basse qui puisse pardonner les affronts; et il nourrit sa rancune, parce que s'il la sentoit s'éteindre, il croiroit avec elle, avoir perdu une vertu.” Sismondi. Lonely and still are now thy marble halls, Thou fair Alhambra! there the feast is o'er; And with the murmur of thy fountain-falls, Blend the wild tones of minstrelsy no more. Hush'd are the voices, that in years gone by, Have mourn'd, exulted, menaced, through thy towers, Within thy pillar'd courts the grass waves high, And all uncultured bloom thy fairy bowers. Unheeded there the flowering myrtle blows, Through tall arcades unmark'd the sunbeam smiles, And many a tint of soften'd brilliance throws O'er fretted walls and shining peristyles. And well might Fancy deem thy fabrics lone, So vast, so silent, and so wildly fair, Some charm'd abode of beings all unknown, Powerful and viewless, children of the air. For there no footstep treads th' enchanted ground, There not a sound the deep repose pervades, Save winds and founts, diffusing freshness round, Through the light domes and graceful colonnades. Far other tones have swell'd those courts along, In days romance yet fondly loves to trace; The clash of arms, the voice of choral song, The revels, combats, of a vanish'd race. And yet awhile, at Fancy's potent call, Shall rise that race, the chivalrous, the bold; Peopling once more each fair, forsaken hall, With stately forms, the knights and chiefs of old. —The sun declines—upon Nevada's height There dwells a mellow flush of rosy light; Each soaring pinnacle of mountain snow Smiles in the richness of that parting glow, And Darro's wave reflects each passing dye That melts and mingles in th' empurpled sky. Fragrance, exhaled from rose and citron bower, Blends with the dewy freshness of the hour: Hush'd are the winds, and Nature seems to sleep In light and stillness; wood, and tower, and steep, Are dyed with tints of glory, only given To the rich evening of a southern heaven; Tints of the sun, whose bright farewell is fraught With all that art hath dreamt, but never caught. —Yes, Nature sleeps; but not with her at rest The fiery passions of the human breast. Hark! from th' Alhambra's towers what stormy sound, Each moment deepening, wildly swells around? Those are no tumults of a festal throng, Not the light zambra, nor the choral song: The combat rages—'tis the shout of war, 'Tis the loud clash of shield and scymitar. Within the hall of Lions, where the rays Of eve, yet lingering, on the fountain blaze; There, girt and guarded by his Zegri bands, And stern in wrath, the Moorish monarch stands: There the strife centres—swords around him wave There bleed the fallen, there contend the brave, While echoing domes return the battle-cry, “Revenge and freedom! let the tyrant die!” And onward rushing, and prevailing still, Court, hall, and tower, the fierce avengers fill. But first and bravest of that gallant train, Where foes are mightiest, charging ne'er in vain; In his red hand the sabre glancing bright, His dark eye flashing with a fiercer light, Ardent, untired, scarce conscious that he bleeds, His Aben-Zurrahs there young Hamet leads; While swells his voice that wild acclaim on high, “Revenge and freedom! let the tyrant die!” Yes, trace the footsteps of the warrior's wrath, By helm and corslet shatter'd in his path; And by the thickest harvest of the slain, And by the marble's deepest crimson stain: Search through the serried fight, where loudest cries From triumph, anguish, or despair, arise; And brightest where the shivering falchions glare, And where the ground is reddest—he is there. Yes, that young arm, amidst the Zegri host, Hath well avenged a sire, a brother, lost. They perish'd—not as heroes should have died, On the red field, in victory's hour of pride, In all the glow and sunshine of their fame, And proudly smiling as the death-pang came: Oh! had they thus expired, a warrior's tear Had flowed, almost in triumph, o'er their bier. For thus alone the brave should weep for those Who brightly pass in glory to repose. —Not such their fate—a tyrant's stern command Doom'd them to fall by some ignoble hand, As, with the flower of all their high-born race, Summon'd Abdallah's royal feast to grace, Fearless in heart, no dream of danger nigh, They sought the banquet's gilded hall—to die. Betray'd, unarm'd, they fell-the fountain wave Flow'd crimson with the life-blood of the brave, Till far the fearful tidings of their fate Through the wide city rung from gate to gate, And of that lineage each surviving son Rush'd to the scene where vengeance might be won. For this young Hamet mingles in the strife, Leader of battle, prodigal of life, Urging his followers, till their foes, beset, Stand faint and breathless, but undaunted yet. Brave Aben-Zurrahs, on! one effort more, Yours is the triumph, and the conflict o'er. But, lo! descending o'er the darken'd hall, The twilight-shadows fast and deeply fall, Nor yet the strife hath ceased—though scarce they know, Through that thick gloom, the brother from the foe; Till the moon rises with her cloudless ray, The peaceful moon, and gives them light to slay. Where lurks Abdallah?—'midst his yielding train, They seek the guilty monarch, but in vain. He lies not number'd with the valiant dead, His champions round him have not vainly bled; But when the twilight spread her shadowy veil, And his last warriors found each effort fail, In wild despair he fled—a trusted few, Kindred in crime, are still in danger true; And o'er the scene of many a martial deed, The Vega's green expanse, his flying footsteps lead. He pass'd th' Alhambra's calm and lovely bowers, Where slept the glistening leaves and folded flowers In dew and starlight—there, from grot and cave, Gush'd, in wild music, many a sparkling wave; There, on each breeze, the breath of fragrance rose, And all was freshness, beauty, and repose. But thou, dark monarch! in thy bosom reign Storms that, once roused, shall never sleep again. Oh! vainly bright is Nature in the course Of him who flies from terror or remorse! A spell is round him which obscures her bloom, And dims her skies with shadows of the tomb; There smiles no Paradise on earth so fair, But guilt will raise avenging phantoms there. Abdallah heeds not, though the light gale roves Fraught with rich odour, stolen from orange-groves; Hears not the sounds from wood and brook that rise, Wild notes of Nature's vesper-melodies; Marks not how lovely, on the mountain's head, Moonlight and snow their mingling lustre spread; But urges onward, till his weary band, Worn with their toil, a moment's pause demand. He stops, and turning, on Granada's fanes In silence gazing, fix'd awhile remains In stern, deep silence—o'er his feverish brow, And burning cheek, pure breezes freshly blow, But waft, in fitful murmurs, from afar, Sounds, indistinctly fearful,—as of war. What meteor bursts, with sudden blaze, on high, O'er the blue clearness of the starry sky? Awful it rises, like some Genie-form, Seen 'midst the redness of the desert storm, Magnificently dread—above, below, Spreads the wild splendour of its deepening glow. Lo! from th' Alhambra's towers the vivid glare Streams through the still transparence of the air, Avenging crowds have lit the mighty pyre, Which feeds that waving pyramid of fire; And dome and minaret, river, wood, and height, From dim perspective start to ruddy light. Oh Heaven! the anguish of Abdallah's soul, The rage, though fruitless, yet beyond control! Yet must he cease to gaze, and raving, fly For life—such life as makes it bliss to die! On yon green height, the mosque, but half reveal'd Through cypress-groves, a safe retreat may yield. Thither his steps are bent—yet oft he turns, Watching that fearful beacon as it burns. But paler grow the sinking flames at last, Flickering they fade, their crimson light is past; And spiry vapours, rising o'er the scene, Mark where the terrors of their wrath have been. And now his feet have reach'd that lonely pile, Where grief and terror may repose awhile; Embower'd it stands, 'midst wood and cliff on high, Through the grey rocks, a torrent sparkling nigh; He hails the scene where every care should cease, And all—except the heart he brings—is peace. There is deep stillness in those halls of state Where the loud cries of conflict rang so late; Stillness like that, when fierce the Kamsin's blast Hath o'er the dwellings of the desert pass'd. Fearful the calm—nor voice, nor step, nor breath, Disturbs that scene of beauty and of death: Those vaulted roofs re-echo not a sound, Save the wild gush of waters—murmuring round, In ceaseless melodies of plaintive tone, Through chambers peopled by the dead alone. O'er the mosaic floors, with carnage red, Breastplate, and shield, and cloven helm are spread In mingled fragments—glittering to the light Of yon still moon, whose rays, yet softly bright, Their streaming lustre tremulously shed, And smile, in placid beauty, o'er the dead: O'er features, where the fiery spirit's trace E'en death itself is powerless to efface; O'er those, who, flush'd with ardent youth, awoke, When glowing morn in bloom and radiance broke, Nor dreamt how near the dark and frozen sleep, Which hears not Glory call, nor Anguish weep; In the low silent house, the narrow spot, Home of forgetfulness—and soon forgot. But slowly fade the stars—the night is o'er— Morn beams on those who hail her light no more; Slumberers who ne'er shall wake on earth again, Mourners, who call the loved, the lost, in vain. Yet smiles the day—oh! not for mortal tear Doth nature deviate from her calm career; Nor is the earth less laughing or less fair, Though breaking hearts her gladness may not share. O'er the cold urn the beam of summer glows, O'er fields of blood the zephyr freshly blows; Bright shines the sun, though all be dark below, And skies arch cloudless o'er a world of woe, And flowers renew'd in spring's green pathway bloom, Alike to grace the banquet and the tomb. Within Granada's walls the funeral-rite Attends that day of loveliness and light; And many a chief, with dirges and with tears, Is gathered to the brave of other years: And Hamet, as beneath the cypress-shade His martyr'd brother and his sire are laid, Feels every deep resolve, and burning thought Of ampler vengeance, e'en to passion wrought; Yet is the hour afar—and he must brood O'er those dark dreams awhile in solitude. Tumult and rage are hush'd—another day In still solemnity hath pass'd away, In that deep slumber of exhausted wrath, The calm that follows in the tempest's path. And now Abdallah leaves yon peaceful fane, His ravaged city traversing again. No sound of gladness his approach precedes, No splendid pageant the procession leads; Where'er he moves the silent streets along, Broods a stern quiet o'er the sullen throng. No voice is heard—but in each alter'd eye, Once brightly beaming when his steps were nigh; And in each look of those, whose love hath fled From all on earth to slumber with the dead, Those, by his guilt made desolate, and thrown On the bleak wilderness of life alone: In youth's quick glance of scarce-dissembled rage, And the pale mien of calmly-mournful age, May well be read a dark and fearful tale Of thought that ill th' indignant heart can veil, And passion, like the hush'd volcano's power, That waits in stillness its appointed hour. No more the clarion, from Granada's walls, Heard o'er the Vega, to the tourney calls; No more her graceful daughters, throned on high, Bend o'er the lists the darkly-radiant eye; Silence and gloom her palaces o'erspread, And song is hush'd, and pageantry is fled. —Weep, fated city! o'er thy heroes weep— Low in the dust the sons of glory sleep! Furl'd are their banners in the lonely hall, Their trophied shields hang mouldering on the wall, Wildly their chargers range the pastures o'er, Their voice in battle shall be heard no more; And they, who still thy tyrant's wrath survive, Whom he hath wrong'd too deeply to forgive, That race, of lineage high, of worth approved, The chivalrous, the princely, the beloved— Thine Aben-Zurrahs—they no more shall wield In thy proud cause the conquering lance and shield: Condemn'd to bid the cherish'd scenes farewell Where the loved ashes of their fathers dwell, And far o'er foreign plains, as exiles, roam, Their land the desert, and the grave their home. Yet there is one shall see that race depart, In deep, though silent, agony of heart: One whose dark fate must be to mourn alone, Unseen her sorrows, and their cause unknown, And veil her heart, and teach her cheek to wear That smile, in which the spirit hath no share; Like the bright beams that shed their fruitless glow O'er the cold solitude of Alpine snow. Soft, fresh, and silent, is the midnight hour, And the young Zayda seeks her lonely bower; That Zegri maid, within whose gentle mind One name is deeply, secretly enshrined. That name in vain stern Reason would efface: Hamet! 'tis thine, thou foe to all her race! And yet not hers in bitterness to prove The sleepless pangs of unrequited love; Pangs, which the rose of wasted youth consume, And make the heart of all delight the tomb, Check the free spirit in its eagle-flight, And the spring-morn of early genius blight; Nor such her grief—though now she wakes to weep, While tearless eyes enjoy the honey-dews of sleep. A step treads lightly through the citron-shade, Lightly, but by the rustling leaves betray'd— Doth her young hero seek that well-known spot, Scene of past hours that ne'er may be forgot? Tis he—but changed that eye, whose glance of fire Could, like a sunbeam, hope and joy inspire, As, luminous with youth, with ardour fraught, It spoke of glory to the inmost thought; Thence the bright spirit's eloquence hath fled, And in its wild expression may be read Stern thoughts and fierce resolves—now veil'd in shade, And now in characters of fire portray'd. Changed e'en his voice—as thus its mournful tone Wakes in her heart each feeling of his own. “Zayda, my doom is fix'd—another day And the wrong'd exile shall be far away; Far from the scenes where still his heart must be, His home of youth, and, more than all—from thee, Oh! what a cloud hath gather'd o'er my lot, Since last we met on this fair tranquil spot! Lovely as then, the soft and silent hour, And not a rose hath faded from thy bower; But I—my hopes the tempest hath o'erthrown, And changed my heart, to all but thee alone. Farewell, high thoughts! inspiring hopes of praise, Heroic visions of my early days! In me the glories of my race must end, The exile hath no country to defend! E'en in life's morn, my dreams of pride are o'er, Youth's buoyant spirit wakes for me no more, And one wild feeling in my alter'd breast Broods darkly o'er the ruins of the rest. Yet fear not thou—to thee, in good or ill, The heart, so sternly tried, is faithful still! But when my steps are distant, and my name Thou hear'st no longer in the song of fame; When Time steals on, in silence to efface Of early love each pure and sacred trace, Causing our sorrows and our hopes to seem But as the moonlight pictures of a dream,— Still shall thy soul be with me, in the truth And all the fervour of affection's youth? —If such thy love, one beam of heaven shall play In lonely beauty, o'er thy wanderer's way.” “Ask not, if such my love! Oh! trust the mind To grief so long, so silently resign'd! Let the light spirit, ne'er by sorrow taught The pure and lofty constancy of thought, Its fleeting trials eager to forget, Rise with elastic power o'er each regret! Foster'd in tears, our young affection grew, And I have learn'd to suffer and be true Deem not my love a frail, ephemeral flower, Nursed by soft sunshine and the balmy shower; No! 'tis the child of tempests and defies, And meets unchanged, the anger of the skies! Too well I feel, with grief's prophetic heart, That ne'er to meet in happier days, we part. We part! and e'en this agonizing hour, When love first feels his own o'erwhelming power, Shall soon to Memory's fixed and tearful eye Seem almost happiness—for thou wert nigh! Yes! when this heart in solitude shall bleed, As days to days all wearily succeed, When doom'd to weep in loneliness, 'twill be Almost like rapture to have wept with thee. “But thou, my Hamet, thou canst yet bestow All that of joy my blighted lot can know. Oh! be thou still the high-soul'd and the brave, To whom my first and fondest vows I gave, In thy proud fame's untarnish'd beauty still The lofty visions of my youth fulfil, So shall it soothe me, 'midst my heart's despair, To hold undimm'd one glorious image there!” “Zayda, my best-beloved! my words too well, Too soon, thy bright illusions must dispel; Yet must my soul to thee unveil'd be shown, And all its dreams and all its passions known. Thou shalt not be deceived—for pure as heaven Is thy young love, in faith and fervour given. I said my heart was changed—and would thy thought Explore the ruin by thy kindred wrought, In fancy trace the land whose towers and fanes, Crush'd by the earthquake, strew its ravaged plains, And such that heart—where desolation's hand Hath blighted all that once was fair or grand! But Vengeance, fix'd upon her burning throne, Sits, 'midst the wreck, in silence and alone, And I, in stern devotion at her shrine, Each softer feeling, but my love, resign. —Yes! they whose spirits all my thoughts control, Who hold dread converse with my thrilling soul, They, the betray'd, the sacrificed, the brave, Who fill a blood-stain'd and untimely grave, Must be avenged! and pity and remorse, In that stern cause, are banish'd from my course. Zayda, thou tremblest—and thy gentle breast Shrinks from the passions that destroy my rest; Yet shall thy form, in many a stormy hour, Pass brightly o'er my soul with softening power, And, oft recall'd, thy voice beguile my lot, Like some sweet lay, once heard, and ne'er forgot. “But the night wanes—the hours too swiftly fly, The bitter moment of farewell draws nigh; Yet, loved one! weep not thus—in joy or pain, Oh! trust thy Hamet, we shall meet again! Yes, we shall meet! and haply smile at last On all the clouds and conflicts of the past. On that fair vision teach thy thoughts to dwell, Nor deem these mingling tears our last farewell!” Is the voice hush'd, whose loved, expressive tone Thrill'd to her heart—and doth she weep alone? Alone she weeps; that hour of parting o'er, When shall the pang it leaves be felt no more? The gale breathes light, and fans her bosom fair, Showering the dewy rose-leaves o'er her hair; But ne'er for her shall dwell reviving power, In balmy dew, soft breeze, or fragrant flower, To wake once more that calm, serene delight, The soul's young bloom, which passion's breath could blight; The smiling stillness of life's morning hour, Ere yet the day-star burns in all his power. Mean-while, through groves of deep luxurious shade, In the rich foliage of the South array'd, Hamet, ere dawns the earliest blush of day, Bends to the vale of tombs his pensive way. Fair is that scene where palm and cypress wave On high o'er many an Aben-Zurrah's grave. Lonely and fair, its fresh and glittering leaves, With the young myrtle there the laurel weaves, To canopy the dead—nor wanting there Flowers to the turf, nor fragrance to the air, Nor wood-bird's note, nor fall of plaintive stream, Wild music, soothing to the mourner's dream. There sleep the chiefs of old—their combats o'er, The voice of glory thrills their hearts no more. Unheard by them th' awakening clarion blows; The sons of war at length in peace repose. No martial note is in the gale that sighs, Where proud their trophied sepulchres arise, 'Mid founts, and shades, and flowers of brightest bloom, As, in his native vale, some shepherd's tomb. There, where the trees their thickest foliage spread Dark o'er that silent valley of the dead; Where two fair pillars rise, embower'd and lone, Not yet with ivy clad, with moss o'ergrown, Young Hamet kneels—while thus his vows are pour'd, The fearful vows that consecrate his sword. —“Spirit of him, who first within my mind Each loftier aim, each nobler thought enshrined, And taught my steps the line of light to trace, Left by the glorious fathers of my race, Hear thou my voice—for thine is with me still, In every dream its tones my bosom thrill, In the deep calm of midnight they are near, 'Midst busy throngs they vibrate on my ear, Still murmuring ‘vengeance!’—nor in vain the call, Few, few shall triumph in a hero's fall! Cold as thine own to glory and to fame, Within my heart there lives one only aim; There, till th' oppressor for thy fate atone, Concentring every thought, it reigns alone. I will not weep—revenge, not grief, must be, And blood, not tears, an offering meet for thee; But the dark hour of stern delight will come, And thou shalt triumph, warrior! in thy tomb. “Thou, too, my brother! thou art pass'd away, Without thy fame, in life's fair-dawning day, Son of the brave! of thee no trace will shine In the proud annals of thy lofty line; Nor shall thy deeds be deathless in the lays That hold communion with the after-days. Yet, by the wreaths thou might'st have nobly won, Hadst thou but lived till rose thy noontide sun; By glory lost, I swear! by hope betray'd, Thy fate shall amply, dearly, be repaid; War with thy foes I deem a holy strife, And, to avenge thy death, devote my life. “Hear ye my vows, O spirits of the slain! Hear, and be with me on the battle-plain! At noon, at midnight, still around me bide, Rise on my dreams, and tell me how ye died!” CANTO II. ?“Oh! ben provvide il Cielo Ch' Uom per delitti mai lieto non sia.” Alfieri. Fair land! of chivalry the old domain, Land of the vine and olive, lovely Spain! Though not for thee with classic shores to vie In charms that fix th' enthusiast's pensive eye; Yet hast thou scenes of beauty, richly fraught With all that wakes the glow of lofty thought; Fountains, and vales, and rocks, whose ancient name High deeds have raised to mingle with their fame. Those scenes are peaceful now: the citron blows, Wild spreads the myrtle, where the brave repose. No sound of battle swells on Douro's shore, And banners wave on Ebro's banks no more. But who, unmoved, unawed, shall coldly tread Thy fields that sepulchre the mighty dead? Blest be that soil! where England's heroes share The grave of chiefs, for ages slumbering there; Whose names are glorious in romantic lays, The wild, sweet chronicles of elder days— By goatherd lone, and rude serrano sung, Thy cypress dells, and vine-clad rocks among. How oft those rocks have echo'd to the tale Of knights who fell in Roncesvalles' vale; Of him, renown'd in old heroic lore, First of the brave, the gallant Campeador; Of those, the famed in song, who proudly died When “Rio Verde” roll'd a crimson tide; Or that high name, by Garcilaso's might, On the green Vega won in single fight. Round fair Granada, deepening from afar, O'er that Green Vega rose the din of war. At morn or eve no more the sunbeams shone O'er a calm scene, in pastoral beauty lone; On helm and corslet tremulous they glanced, On shield and spear in quivering lustre danced. Far as the sight by clear Xenil could rove, Tents rose around, and banners glanced above. And steeds in gorgeous trappings, armour bright With gold, reflecting every tint of light, And many a floating plume, and blazon'd shield, Diffused romantic splendour o'er the field. There swell those sounds that bid the life-blood start Swift to the mantling cheek, and beating heart. The clang of echoing steel, the charger's neigh, The measured tread of hosts in war's array; And, oh! that music, whose exulting breath Speaks but of glory on the road to death; In whose wild voice there dwells inspiring power To wake the stormy joy of danger's hour; To nerve the arm, the spirit to sustain, Rouse from despondence, and support in pain; And, 'midst the deepening tumults of the strife, Teach every pulse to thrill with more than life. High o'er the camp, in many a broider'd fold, Floats to the wind a standard rich with gold: There, imaged on the cross, his form appears Who drank for man the bitter cup of tears. His form, whose word recall'd the spirit fled, Now borne by hosts to guide them o'er the dead! O'er yon fair walls to plant the cross on high, Spain hath sent forth her flower of chivalry. Fired with that ardour which, in days of yore, To Syrian plains the bold crusaders bore; Elate with lofty hope, with martial zeal, They come, the gallant children of Castile; The proud, the calmly dignified:—and there Ebro's dark sons with haughty mien repair, And those who guide the fiery steed of war From yon rich province of the western star. But thou, conspicuous 'midst the glitt'ring scene, Stern grandeur stamp'd upon thy princely mien; Known by the foreign garb, the silvery vest, The snow-white charger, and the azure crest, Young Aben-Zurrah! 'midst that host of foes, Why shines thy helm, thy Moorish lance? Disclose! Why rise the tents, where dwell thy kindred train, O son of Afric, 'midst the sons of Spain? Hast thou with these thy nation's fall conspired, Apostate chief! by hope of vengeance fired? How art thou changed! Still first in every fight, Hamet, the Moor! Castile's devoted knight! There dwells a fiery lustre in thine eye, But not the light that shone in days gone by; There is wild ardour in thy look and tone, But not the soul's expression once thine own, Nor aught like peace within. Yet who shall say What secret thoughts thine inmost heart may sway? No eye but Heaven's may pierce that curtain'd breast, Whose joys and griefs alike are unexpress'd. There hath been combat on the tented plain; The Vega's turf is red with many a stain; And, rent and trampled, banner, crest, and shield, Tell of a fierce and well-contested field: But all is peaceful now—the west is bright With the rich splendour of departing light; Mulhacen's peak, half lost amidst the sky, Glows like a purple evening-cloud on high, And tints, that mock the pencil's art, o'erspread Th' eternal snow that crowns Veleta's head; While the warm sunset o'er the landscape throws A solemn beauty, and a deep repose. Closed are the toils and tumults of the day, And Hamet wanders from the camp away. In silent musings rapt:—the slaughter'd brave Lie thickly strewn by Darro's rippling wave. Soft fall the dews—but other drops have dyed The scented shrubs that fringe the river side, Beneath whose shade, as ebbing life retired, The wounded sought a shelter—and expired. Lonely, and lost in thoughts of other days, By the bright windings of the stream he strays, Till, more remote from battle's ravaged scene, All is repose, and solitude serene. There, 'neath an olive's ancient shade reclined, Whose rustling foliage waves in evening's wind, The harass'd warrior, yielding to the power, The mild sweet influence of the tranquil hour, Feels, by degrees, a long-forgotten calm Shed o'er his troubled soul unwonted balm; His wrongs, his woes, his dark and dubious lot, The past, the future, are awhile forgot; And Hope, scarce own'd, yet stealing o'er his breast, Half dares to whisper, “Thou shalt yet be blest!” Such his vague musings—but a plaintive sound Breaks on the deep and solemn stillness round; A low, half-stifled moan, that seems to rise From life and death's contending agonies. He turns: Who shares with him that lonely shade? —A youthful warrior on his death-bed laid. All rent and stain'd his broider'd Moorish vest, The corslet shatter'd on his bleeding breast; In his cold hand the broken falchion strain'd, With life's last force convulsively retain'd; His plumage soil'd with dust, with crimson dyed, And the red lance, in fragments, by his side: He lies forsaken—pillow'd on his shield, His helmet raised, his lineaments reveal'd. Pale is that quivering lip, and vanish'd now The light once throned on that commanding brow; And o'er that fading eye, still upward cast, The shades of death are gathering dark and fast. Yet, as yon rising moon her light serene Sheds the pale olive's waving boughs between, Too well can Hamet's conscious heart retrace, Though changed thus fearfully, that pallid face, Whose every feature to his soul conveys Some bitter thought of long-departed days. “Oh! is it thus,” he cries, “we meet at last? Friend of my soul in years for ever past! Hath fate but led me hither to behold The last dread struggle, ere that heart is cold,— Receive thy latest agonizing breath, And, with vain pity, soothe the pangs of death? Yet let me bear thee hence—while life remains, E'en though thus feebly circling through thy veins, Some healing balm thy sense may still revive, Hope is not lost—and Osmyn yet may live! And blest were he, whose timely care should save A heart so noble, e'en from glory's grave.” Roused by those accents, from his lowly bed The dying warrior faintly lifts his head; O'er Hamet's mien, with vague, uncertain gaze, His doubtful glance awhile bewilder'd strays; Till, by degrees, a smile of proud disdain Lights up those features late convulsed with pain; A quivering radiance flashes from his eye, That seems too pure, too full of soul, to die; And the mind's grandeur, in its parting hour, Looks from that brow with more than wonted power. “Away!” he cries, in accents of command, And proudly waves his cold and trembling hand. “Apostate, hence! my soul shall soon be free, E'en now it soars, disdaining aid from thee: 'Tis not for thee to close the fading eyes Of him who faithful to his country dies; Not for thy hand to raise the drooping head Of him who sinks to rest on glory's bed. Soon shall these pangs be closed, this conflict o'er, And worlds be mine where thou canst never soar: Be thine existence with a blighted name, Mine the bright death which seals a warrior's fame!” The glow hath vanish'd from his cheek—his eye Hath lost that beam of parting energy; Frozen and fix'd it seems—his brow is chill; One struggle more—that noble heart is still. Departed warrior! were thy mortal throes, Were thy last pangs, ere Nature found repose, More keen, more bitter, than th' envenomed dart Thy dying words have left in Hamet's heart? Thy pangs were transient; his shall sleep no more, Till life's delirious dream itself is o'er; But thou shalt rest in glory, and thy grave Be the pure altar of the patriot brave. Oh, what a change that little hour hath wrought In the high spirit, and unbending thought! Yet, from himself each keen regret to hide, Still Hamet struggles with indignant pride; While his soul rises, gathering all its force, To meet the fearful conflict with remorse. To thee, at length, whose artless love hath been His own, unchanged, through many a stormy scene; Zayda! to thee his heart for refuge flies; Thou still art faithful to affection's ties. Yes! let the world upbraid, let foes contemn, Thy gentle breast the tide will firmly stem; And soon thy smile, and soft consoling voice Shall bid his troubled soul again rejoice. Within Granada's walls are hearts and hands Whose aid in secret Hamet yet commands; Nor hard the task, at some propitious hour, To win his silent way to Zayda's bower, When night and peace are brooding o'er the world, When mute the clarions, and the banners furl'd. That hour is come—and, o'er the arms he bears, A wandering fakir's garb the chieftain wears: Disguise that ill from piercing eye could hide The lofty port, and glance of martial pride; But night befriends—through paths obscure he pass'd, And hail'd the lone and lovely scene at last; Young Zayda's chosen haunt, the fair alcove, The sparkling fountain, and the orange grove; Calm in the moonlight smiles the still retreat, As form'd alone for happy hearts to meet. For happy hearts?—not such as hers, who there Bends o'er her lute, with dark, unbraided hair; That maid of Zegri race, whose eye, whose mien, Tell that despair her bosom's guest hath been. So lost in thought she seems, the warrior's feet Unheard approach her solitary seat, Till his known accents every sense restore— “My own loved Zayda! do we meet once more?” She starts, she turns—the lightning of surprise, Of sudden rapture, flashes from her eyes; But that is fleeting—it is past—and now Far other meaning darkens o'er her brow: Changed is her aspect, and her tone severe— “Hence, Aben-Zurrah! death surrounds thee here!” “Zayda! what means that glance, unlike thine own? What mean those words, and that unwonted tone? I will not deem thee changed—but in thy face, It is not joy, it is not love, I trace! It was not thus in other days we met: Hath time, hath absence, taught thee to forget? Oh! speak once more—these rising doubts dispel; One smile of tenderness, and all is well!” “Not thus we met in other days!—oh, no! Thou wert not, warrior, then thy country's foe! Those days are past—we ne'er shall meet again With hearts all warmth, all confidence, as then. But thy dark soul no gentler feelings sway, Leader of hostile bands! away, away! On in thy path of triumph and of power, Nor pause to raise from earth a blighted flower.” “And thou too changed! thine early vow forgot! This, this alone, was wanting to my lot! Exiled and scorn'd, of every tie bereft, Thy love, the desert's lonely fount, was left; And thou, my soul's last hope, its lingering beam, Thou, the good angel of each brighter dream, Wert all the barrenness of life possest, To wake one soft affection in my breast! That vision ended—fate hath nought in store Of joy or sorrow e'er to touch me more. Go, Zegri maid! to scenes of sunshine fly, From the stern pupil of adversity! And now to hope, to confidence, adieu! If thou art faithless, who shall e'er be true?” “Hamet! oh, wrong me not!—I too could speak Of sorrows—trace them on my faded cheek, In the sunk eye, and in the wasted form, That tell the heart hath nursed a canker worm! But words were idle—read my sufferings there, Where grief is stamp'd on all that once was fair. “Oh, wert thou still what once I fondly deem'd, All that thy mien express'd, thy spirit seem'd, My love had been devotion—till in death Thy name had trembled on my latest breath. But not the chief who leads a lawless band, To crush the altars of his native land; Th' apostate son of heroes, whose disgrace Hath stain'd the trophies of a glorious race; Not him I loved—but one whose youthful name Was pure and radiant in unsullied fame. Hadst thou but died, ere yet dishonour's cloud O'er that young name had gather'd as a shroud, I then had mourn'd thee proudly, and my grief In its own loftiness had found relief; A noble sorrow, cherish'd to the last, When every meaner woe had long been past. Yes! let Affection weep—no common tear She sheds, when bending o'er a hero's bier. Let Nature mourn the dead—a grief like this, To pangs that rend my bosom, had been bliss!” “High-minded maid! the time admits not now To plead my cause, to vindicate my vow. That vow, too dread, too solemn to recall, Hath urged me onward, haply to my fall. Yet this believe—no meaner aim inspires My soul, no dream of poor ambition fires. No! every hope of power, of triumph, fled, Behold me but th' avenger of the dead! One whose changed heart no tie, no kindred knows, And in thy love alone hath sought repose. Zayda! wilt thou his stern accuser be? False to his country, he is true to thee! Oh, hear me yet!—if Hamet e'er was dear, By our first vows, our young affection, hear! Soon must this fair and royal city fall, Soon shall the cross be planted on her wall; Then who can tell what tides of blood may flow, While her fanes echo to the shrieks of woe? Fly, fly with me, and let me bear thee far From horrors thronging in the path of war: Fly! and repose in safety—till the blast Hath made a desert in its course—and pass'd!” “Thou that wilt triumph when the hour is come, Hasten'd by thee, to seal thy country's doom, With thee from scenes of death shall Zayda fly To peace and safety?—Woman, too, can die! And die exulting, though unknown to fame, In all the stainless beauty of her name! Be mine, unmurmuring, undismay'd, to share The fate my kindred and my sire must bear. And deem thou not my feeble heart shall fail, When the clouds gather and the blasts assail Thou hast but known me ere the trying hour Call'd into life my spirit's latent power; But I have energies that idly slept, While withering o'er my silent woes I wept, And now, when hope and happiness are fled, My soul is firm—for what remains to dread? Who shall have power to suffer and to bear, If strength and courage dwell not with Despair? “Hamet, farewell—retrace thy path again, To join thy brethren on the tented plain. There wave and wood, in mingling murmurs, tell How, in far other cause, thy fathers fell! Yes! on that soil hath Glory's footstep been, Names unforgotten consecrate the scene! Dwell not the souls of heroes round thee there, Whose voices call thee in the whispering air? Unheard, in vain, they call—their fallen son Hath stain'd the name those mighty spirits won, And to the hatred of the brave and free Bequeath'd his own, through ages yet to be!” Still as she spoke, th' enthusiast's kindling eye Was lighted up with inborn majesty, While her fair form and youthful features caught All the proud grandeur of heroic thought, Severely beauteous: awe-struck and amazed, In silent trance a while the warrior gazed, As on some lofty vision—for she seem'd One all-inspired—each look with glory beam'd, While, brightly bursting, through its cloud of woes, Her soul at once in all its light arose. Oh! ne'er had Hamet deem'd there dwelt enshrined, In form so fragile, that unconquer'd mind; And fix'd, as by some high enchantment, there He stood—till wonder yielded to despair. “The dream is vanish'd—daughter of my foes! Reft of each hope the lonely wanderer goes. Thy words have pierced his soul—yet deem thou not Thou couldst be once adored, and e'er forgot! O form'd for happier love; heroic maid! In grief sublime, in danger undismay'd, Farewell, and be thou blest!—all words were vain From him who ne'er may view that form again; Him, whose sole thought, resembling bliss, must be, He hath been loved, once fondly loved, by thee!” And is the warrior gone?—doth Zayda hear His parting footstep, and without a tear? Thou weep'st not, lofty maid!—yet who can tell What secret pangs within thy heart may dwell? They feel not least, the firm, the high in soul, Who best each feeling's agony control. Yes, we may judge the measure of the grief Which finds in Misery's eloquence relief; But who shall pierce those depths of silent woe Whence breathes no language, whence no tears may flow? The pangs that many a noble breast hath proved, Scorning itself that thus it could be moved? He, He alone, the inmost heart who knows, Views all its weakness, pities all its throes, He who hath mercy when mankind contemn, Beholding anguish—all unknown to them. Fair city! thou that midst thy stately fanes And gilded minarets, towering o'er the plains, In eastern grandeur proudly dost arise Beneath thy canopy of deep-blue skies; While streams that bear thee treasures in their wave, Thy citron-groves and myrtle-gardens lave: Mourn, for thy doom is fixed—the days of fear, Of chains, of wrath, of bitterness, are near! Within, around thee, are the trophied graves Of kings and chiefs—their children shall be slaves. Fair are thy halls, thy domes majestic swell, But there a race that rear'd them not shall dwell; For 'midst thy councils Discord still presides, Degenerate fear thy wavering monarch guides, Last of a line whose regal spirit flown Hath to their offspring but bequeath'd a throne, Without one generous thought, or feeling high, To teach his soul how kings should live and die. A voice resounds within Granada's wall, The hearts of warriors echo to its call. Whose are those tones, with power electric fraught, To reach the source of pure exalted thought? See, on a fortress tower, with beckoning hand, A form, majestic as a prophet, stand! His mien is all impassion'd—and his eye Fill'd with a light whose fountain is on high; Wild on the gale his silvery tresses flow, And inspiration beams upon his brow; While, thronging round him, breathless thousands gaze, As on some mighty seer of elder days. “Saw ye the banners of Castile display'd, The helmets glittering, and the line array'd? Heard ye the march of steel-clad hosts?” he cries; “Children of conquerors! in your strength arise! O high-born tribes! O names unstain'd by fear! Azarques, Zegris, Almoradis, hear! Be every feud forgotten, and your hands Dyed with no blood but that of hostile bands. Wake, princes of the land! the hour is come, And the red sabre must decide your doom. Where is that spirit which prevail'd of yore, When Tarik's bands o'erspread the western shore? When the long combat raged on Xeres' plain, And Afric's tecbir swell'd through yielding Spain? Is the lance broken, is the shield decay'd, The warrior's arm unstrung, his heart dismay'd? Shall no high spirit of ascendant worth Arise to lead the sons of Islam forth? To guard the regions where our fathers' blood Hath bathed each plain, and mingled with each flood; Where long their dust hath blended with the soil Won by their swords, made fertile by their toil? “O ye sierras of eternal snow! Ye streams that by the tombs of heroes flow, Woods, fountains, rocks of Spain! ye saw their might In many a fierce and unforgotten fight— Shall ye behold their lost, degenerate race, Dwell 'midst your scenes in fetters and disgrace? With each memorial of the past around, Each mighty monument of days renown'd? May this indignant heart ere then be cold, This frame be gather'd to its kindred mould! And the last life-drop circling through my veins Have tinged a soil untainted yet by chains! “And yet one struggle ere our doom is seal'd, One mighty effort, one deciding field! If vain each hope, we still have choice to be, In life the fetter'd, or in death the free!” Still while he speaks, each gallant heart beats high, And ardour flashes from each kindling eye; Youth, manhood, age, as if inspired, have caught The glow of lofty hope and daring thought, And all is hush'd around—as every sense Dwelt on the tones of that wild eloquence. But when his voice hath ceased, th' impetuous cry Of eager thousands bursts at once on high; Rampart, and rock, and fortress, ring around, And fair Alhambra's inmost halls resound. “Lead us, O chieftain! lead us to the strife, To fame in death, or liberty in life!” O zeal of noble hearts! in vain display'd! Now, while the burning spirit of the brave Is roused to energies that yet might save, E'en now, enthusiasts! while ye rush to claim Your glorious trial on the field of fame, Your king hath yielded! Valour's dream is o'er; Power, wealth, and freedom, are your own no more; And for your children's portion, but remains That bitter heritage—the stranger's chains. CANTO III. “Fermossi al fin il cor che balzò tanto.” Hippolito Pindemonte. Heroes of elder days! untaught to yield, Who bled for Spain on many an ancient field; Ye, that around the oaken cross of yore Stood firm and fearless on Asturia's shore, And with your spirit, ne'er to be subdued, Hallow'd the wild Cantabrian solitude; Rejoice amidst your dwellings of repose, In the last chastening of your Moslem foes! Rejoice!—for Spain, arising in her strength, Hath burst the remnant of their yoke at length, And they, in turn, the cup of woe must drain, And bathe their fetters with their tears in vain. And thou, the warrior born in happy hour, Valencia's lord, whose name alone was power, Theme of a thousand songs in days gone by, Conqueror of kings! exult, O Cid! on high. For still 'twas thine to guard thy country's weal, In life, in death, the watcher for Castile! Thou, in that hour when Mauritania's bands Rush'd from their palmy groves and burning lands, E'en in the realm of spirits didst retain A patriot's vigilance, remembering Spain! Then, at deep midnight, rose the mighty sound, By Leon heard, in shuddering awe profound, As through her echoing streets, in dread array, Beings, once mortal, held their viewless way: Voices, from worlds we know not—and the tread Of marching hosts, the armies of the dead, Thou and thy buried chieftains—from the grave Then did thy summons rouse a king to save, And join thy warriors with unearthly might To aid the rescue in Tolosa's fight. Those days are past—the crescent on thy shore, O realm of evening! sets, to rise no more. What banner streams afar from Vela's tower? The cross, bright ensign of Iberia's power! What the glad shout of each exulting voice? Castile and Aragon! rejoice, rejoice! Yielding free entrance to victorious foes, The Moorish city sees her gates unclose, And Spain's proud host, with pennon, shield, and lance, Through her long streets in knightly garb advance. Oh! ne'er in lofty dreams hath Fancy's eye Dwelt on a scene of statelier pageantry, At joust or tourney, theme of poet's lore, High masque, or solemn festival of yore. The gilded cupolas, that proudly rise O'erarch'd by cloudless and cerulean skies; Tall minarets, shining mosques, barbaric towers, Fountains, and palaces, and cypress bowers: And they, the splendid and triumphant throng, With helmets glittering as they move along With broider'd scarf, and gem-bestudded mail, And graceful plumage streaming on the gale; Shields, gold-emboss'd, and pennons floating far, And all the gorgeous blazonry of war, All brighten'd by the rich transparent hues That southern suns o'er heaven and earth diffuse; Blend in one scene of glory, form'd to throw O'er memory's page a never-fading glow. And there, too, foremost'midst the conquering brave, Your azure plumes, O Aben-Zurrahs! wave. There Hamet moves; the chief whose lofty port Seems nor reproach to shun, nor praise to court; Calm, stern, collected—yet within his breast Is there no pang, no struggle, unconfess'd? If such there be, it still must dwell unseen, Nor cloud a triumph with a sufferer's mien. Hear'st thou the solemn, yet exulting sound, Of the deep anthem floating far around? The choral voices, to the skies that raise The full majestic harmony of praise? Lo! where, surrounded by their princely train, They come, the sovereigns of rejoicing Spain, Borne on their trophied car—lo! bursting thence A blaze of chivalrous magnificence! Onward their slow and stately course they bend To where th' Alhambra's ancient towers ascend, Rear'd and adorn'd by Moorish kings of yore, Whose lost descendants there shall dwell no more. They reach those towers—irregularly vast And rude they seem, in mould barbaric cast: They enter—to their wondering sight is given A genii palace—an Arabian heaven! A scene by magic raised, so strange, so fair, Its forms and colour seem alike of air. Here, by sweet orange-boughs, half shaded o'er, The deep clear bath reveals its marble floor, Its margin fringed with flowers, whose glowing hues The calm transparence of its wave suffuse. There, round the court, where Moorish arches bend, Aërial columns, richly deck'd, ascend; Unlike the models of each classic race, Of Doric grandeur, or Corinthian grace, But answering well each vision that portrays Arabian splendour to the poet's gaze: Wild, wondrous, brilliant, all—a mingling glow Of rainbow-tints, above, around, below; Bright streaming from the many-tinctured veins Of precious marble, and the vivid stains Of rich mosaics o'er the light arcade, In gay festoons and fairy knots display'd. On through th' enchanted realm, that only seems Meet for the radiant creatures of our dreams, The royal conquerors pass—while still their sight On some new wonder dwells with fresh delight. Here the eye roves through slender colonnades, O'er bowery terraces and myrtle shades; Dark olive-woods beyond, and far on high The vast sierra mingling with the sky. There, scattering far around their diamond spray, Clear streams from founts of alabaster play, Through pillar'd halls, where, exquisitely wrought, Rich arabesques, with glittering foliage fraught, Surmount each fretted arch, and lend the scene A wild, romantic, oriental mien: While many a verse, from eastern bards of old, Borders the walls in characters of gold. Here Moslem luxury, in her own domain, Hath held for ages her voluptuous reign 'Midst gorgeous domes, where soon shall silence brood, And all be lone—a splendid solitude. Now wake their echoes to a thousand songs, From mingling voices of exulting throngs; Tambour, and flute, and atabal, are there, And joyous clarions pealing on the air; While every hall resounds, “Granada won! Granada! for Castile and Aragon!” 'Tis night—from dome and tower, in dazzling maze, The festal lamps innumerably blaze; Through long arcades their quivering lustre gleams, From every lattice tremulously streams, 'Midst orange-gardens plays on fount and rill, And gilds the waves of Darro and Xenil; Red flame the torches on each minaret's height, And shines each street an avenue of light; And midnight feasts are held, and music's voice Through the long night still summons to rejoice. Yet there, while all would seem to heedless eye One blaze of pomp, one burst of revelry, Are hearts unsoothed by those delusive hours, Gall'd by the chain, though deck'd awhile with flowers; Stern passions working in th' indignant breast, Deep pangs untold, high feelings unexpress'd, Heroic spirits, unsubmitting yet— Vengeance, and keen remorse, and vain regret. From yon proud height, whose olive-shaded brow Commands the wide, luxuriant plains below, Who lingering gazes o'er the lovely scene, Anguish and shame contending in his mien? He, who, of heroes and of kings the son, Hath lived to lose whate'er his fathers won; Whose doubts and fears his people's fate have seal'd, Wavering alike in council and in field; Weak, timid ruler of the wise and brave, Still a fierce tyrant or a yielding slave. Far from these vine-clad hills and azure skies, To Afric's wilds the royal exile flies; Yet pauses on his way, to weep in vain O'er all he never must behold again. Fair spreads the scene around—for him too fair, Each glowing charm but deepens his despair. The Vega's meads, the city's glittering spires, The old majestic palace of his sires, The gay pavilions, and retired alcoves, Bosom'd in citron and pomegranate groves; Tower-crested rocks, and streams that wind in light, All in one moment bursting on his sight, Speak to his soul of glory's vanished years, And wake the source of unavailing tears. —Weep'st thou, Abdallah?—Thou dost well to weep O feeble heart! o'er all thou couldst not keep! Well do a woman's tears befit the eye Of him who knew not, as a man, to die. The gale sighs mournfully through Zayda's bower, The hand is gone that nursed each infant flower. No voice, no step, is in her father's halls, Mute are the echoes of their marble walls; No stranger enters at the chieftain's gate, But all is hush'd, and void, and desolate. There, through each tower and solitary shade, In vain doth Hamet seek the Zegri maid: Her grove is silent, her pavilion lone, Her lute forsaken, and her doom unknown; And through the scene she loved, unheeded flows The stream whose music lull'd her to repose. But oh! to him, whose self-accusing thought Whispers, 'twas he that desolation wrought; He, who his country and his faith betray'd, And lent Castile revengeful, powerful aid; A voice of sorrow swells in every gale, Each wave, low rippling, tells a mournful tale; And as the shrubs, untended, unconfined, In wild exuberance rustle to the wind; Each leaf hath language to his startled sense, And seems to murmur—“Thou hast driven her hence!” And well he feels to trace her flight were vain, —Where hath lost love been once recall'd again? In her pure breast, so long by anguish torn, His name can rouse no feeling now—but scorn. O bitter hour! when first the shuddering heart Wakes to behold the void within—and start! To feel its own abandonment, and brood O'er the chill bosom's depth of solitude. The stormy passions that in Hamet's breast Have sway'd so long, so fiercely, are at rest; Th' avenger's task is closed:—he finds too late, It hath not changed his feelings, but his fate. He was a lofty spirit, turn'd aside From its bright path by woes, and wrongs, and pride, And onward, in its new tumultuous course, Borne with too rapid and intense a force To pause one moment in the dread career, And ask—if such could be its native sphere? Now are those days of wild delirium o'er, Their fears and hopes excite his soul no more; The feverish energies of passion close, And his heart sinks in desolate repose, Turns sickening from the world, yet shrinks not less From its own deep and utter loneliness. There is a sound of voices on the air, A flash of armour to the sunbeam's glare, 'Midst the wild Alpuxarras;—there, on high, Where mountain-snows are mingling with the sky, A few brave tribes, with spirit yet unbroke, Have fled indignant from the Spaniard's yoke. O ye dread scenes! where Nature dwells alone, Severely glorious on her craggy throne; Ye citadels of rock, gigantic forms, Veil'd by the mists, and girdled by the storms,— Ravines, and glens, and deep resounding caves, That hold communion with the torrent-waves; And ye, th' unstain'd and everlasting snows, That dwell above in bright and still repose; To you, in every clime, in every age, Far from the tyrant's or the conqueror's rage, Hath Freedom led her sons:—untired to keep Her fearless vigils on the barren steep. She, like the mountain eagle, still delights To gaze exulting from unconquer'd heights, And build her eyrie in defiance proud, To dare the wind, and mingle with the cloud. Now her deep voice, the soul's awakener, swells, Wild Alpuxarras, through your inmost dells. There, the dark glens and lonely rocks among, As at the clarion's call, her children throng. She with enduring strength had nerved each frame, And made each heart the temple of her flame, Her own resisting spirit, which shall glow Unquenchably, surviving all below. There high-born maids, that moved upon the earth, More like bright creatures of aerial birth, Nurslings of palaces, have fled to share The fate of brothers and of sires; to bear, All undismay'd, privation and distress, And smile the roses of the wilderness: And mothers with their infants, there to dwell In the deep forest or the cavern cell, And rear their offspring midst the rocks, to be, If now no more the mighty, still the free. And 'midst that band are veterans, o'er whose head Sorrows and years their mingled snow have shed: They saw thy glory, they have wept thy fall, O royal city! and the wreck of all They loved and hallow'd most:—doth aught remain For these to prove of happiness or pain? Life's cup is drain'd—earth fades before their eye, Their task is closing—they have but to die. Ask ye, why fled they hither?—that their doom Might be, to sink unfetter'd to the tomb. And youth, in all its pride of strength, is there, And buoyancy of spirit, form'd to dare And suffer all things—fall'n on evil days, Yet darting o'er the world an ardent gaze, As on th' arena, where its powers may find Full scope to strive for glory with mankind. Such are the tenants of the mountain-hold, The high in heart, unconquer'd, uncontroll'd: By day, the huntsmen of the wild—by night, Unwearied guardians of the watch-fire's light, They from their bleak majestic home have caught A sterner tone of unsubmitting thought, While all around them bids the soul arise To blend with Nature's dread sublimities. —But these are lofty dreams, and must not be Where tyranny is near:—the bended knee, The eye, whose glance no inborn grandeur fires, And the tamed heart, are tributes she requires; Nor must the dwellers of the rock look down On regal conquerors, and defy their frown. What warrior-band is toiling to explore The mountain-pass, with pine-wood shadow'd o'er? Startling with martial sounds each rude recess, Where the deep echo slept in loneliness. These are the sons of Spain!—Your foes are near, O exiles of the wild sierra! hear! Hear! wake! arise! and from your inmost caves Pour like the torrent in its might of waves! Who leads the invaders on?—his features bear The deep-worn traces of a calm despair; Yet his dark brow is haughty—and his eye Speaks of a soul that asks not sympathy. 'Tis he! 'tis he again! th' apostate chief; He comes in all the sternness of his grief. He comes, but changed in heart, no more to wield Falchion for proud Castile in battle-field, Against his country's children—though he leads Castilian bands again to hostile deeds: His hope is but from ceaseless pangs to fly, To rush upon the Moslem spears, and die. So shall remorse and love the heart release, Which dares not dream of joy, but sighs for peace. The mountain-echoes are awake—a sound Of strife is ringing through the rocks around. Within the steep defile that winds between Cliffs piled on cliffs, a dark, terrific scene, Where Moorish exile and Castilian knight Are wildly mingling in the serried fight. Red flows the foaming streamlet of the glen, Whose bright transparence ne'er was stained till then; While swell the war-note, and the clash of spears, To the bleak dwellings of the mountaineers, Where thy sad daughters, lost Granada! wait, In dread suspense, the tidings of their fate. But he—whose spirit, panting for its rest, Would fain each sword concentrate in his breast— Who, where a spear is pointed, or a lance Aim'd at another's breast, would still advance— Courts death in vain; each weapon glances by, As if for him 'twere bliss too great to die. Yes, Aben-Zurrah! there are deeper woes Reserved for thee ere Nature's last repose; Thou know'st not yet what vengeance fate can wreak, Nor all the heart can suffer ere it break. Doubtful and long the strife, and bravely fell The sons of battle in that narrow dell; Youth in its light of beauty there hath past, And age, the weary, found repose at last; Till, few and faint, the Moslem tribes recoil, Borne down by numbers, and o'erpower'd by toil. Dispersed, dishearten'd, through the pass they fly, Pierce the deep wood, or mount the cliff on high; While Hamet's band in wonder gaze, nor dare Track o'er their dizzy path the footsteps of despair. Yet he, to whom each danger hath become A dark delight, and every wild a home, Still urges onward—undismay'd to tread Where life's fond lovers would recoil with dread. But fear is for the happy—they may shrink From the steep precipice, or torrent's brink; They to whom earth is paradise—their doom Lends no stern courage to approach the tomb: Not such his lot, who, school'd by fate severe, Were but too blest if aught remain'd to fear. Up the rude crags, whose giant masses throw Eternal shadows o'er the glen below; And by the fall, whose many-tinctured spray Half in a mist of radiance veils its way, He holds his venturous track:—supported now By some o'erhanging pine or ilex bough; Now by some jutting stone, that seems to dwell Half in mid-air, as balanced by a spell: Now hath his footstep gain'd the summit's head, A level span, with emerald verdure spread, A fairy circle—there the heath-flowers rise, And the rock-rose unnoticed blooms and dies; And brightly plays the stream, ere yet its tide In foam and thunder cleave the mountain side; But all is wild beyond—and Hamet's eye Roves o'er a world of rude sublimity. That dell beneath, where e'en at noon of day Earth's charter'd guest, the sunbeam, scarce can stray; Around, untrodden woods; and far above Where mortal footstep ne'er may hope to rove, Bare granite cliffs, whose fix'd, inherent dyes Rival the tints that float o'er summer skies; And the pure glittering snow-realm, yet more high, That seems a part of Heaven's eternity. There is no track of man where Hamet stands, Pathless the scene as Lybia's desert sands; Yet on the calm, still air, a sound is heard Of distant voices, and the gathering-word Of Islam's tribes, now faint and fainter grown, Now but the lingering echo of a tone. That sound, whose cadence dies upon his ear, He follows, reckless if his bands are near. On by the rushing stream his way he bends, And through the mountain's forest zone ascends; Piercing the still and solitary shades Of ancient pine, and dark, luxuriant glades, Eternal twilight's reign:—those mazes past, The glowing sunbeams meet his eyes at last, And the lone wanderer now hath reach'd the source Whence the wave gushes, foaming on its course. But there he pauses—for the lonely scene Towers in such dread magnificence of mien, And, mingled oft with some wild eagle's cry, From rock-built eyrie rushing to the sky, So deep the solemn and majestic sound Of forests, and of waters murmuring round— That, rapt in wondering awe, his heart forgets Its fleeting struggles, and its vain regrets. —What earthly feeling, unabash'd, can dwell In Nature's mighty presence?—'midst the swell Of everlasting hills, the roar of floods, And frown of rocks, and pomp of waving woods? These their own grandeur on the soul impress, And bid each passion feel its nothingness. 'Midst the vast marble cliffs, a lofty cave Rears its broad arch beside the rushing wave; Shadow'd by giant oaks, and rude, and lone, It seems the temple of some power unknown, Where earthly being may not dare intrude To pierce the secrets of the solitude. Yet thence at intervals a voice of wail Is rising, wild and solemn, on the gale. Did thy heart thrill, O Hamet! at the tone? Came it not o'er thee as a spirit's moan? As some loved sound, that long from earth had fled, The unforgotten accents of the dead? E'en thus it rose—and springing from his trance His eager footsteps to the sound advance. He mounts the cliffs, he gains the cavern floor; Its dark green moss with blood is sprinkled o'er: He rushes on—and lo! where Zayda rends Her locks, as o'er her slaughter'd sire she bends, Lost in despair;—yet, as a step draws nigh, Disturbing sorrow's lonely sanctity, She lifts her head, and, all-subdued by grief, Views, with a wild, sad smile, the once-loved chief; While rove her thoughts, unconscious of the past, And every woe forgetting—but the last. “Com'st thou to weep with me?—for I am left Alone on earth, of every tie bereft. Low lies the warrior on his blood-stain'd bier; His child may call, but he no more shall hear. He sleeps—but never shall those eyes unclose; 'Twas not my voice that lull'd him to repose; Nor can it break his slumbers.—Dost thou mourn? And is thy heart, like mine, with anguish torn? Weep, and my soul a joy in grief shall know, That o'er his grave my tears with Hamet's flow!” But scarce her voice had breathed that well-known name, When, swiftly rushing o'er her spirit, came Each dark remembrance; by affliction's power Awhile effaced in that o'erwhelming hour, To wake with tenfold strength;—'twas then her eye Resumed its light, her mien its majesty, And o'er her wasted cheek a burning glow Spreads, while her lips' indignant accents flow. “Away! I dream—oh, how hath sorrow's might Bow'd down my soul, and quench'd its native light— That I should thus forget! and bid thy tear With mine be mingled o'er a father's bier! Did he not perish, haply by thy hand, In the last combat with thy ruthless band? The morn beheld that conflict of despair:— 'Twas then he fell—he fell!—and thou wert there! Thou! who thy country's children hast pursued To their last refuge 'midst these mountains rude. Was it for this I loved thee?—Thou hast taught My soul all grief, all bitterness of thought! 'Twill soon be past—I bow to Heaven's decree, Which bade each pang be minister'd by thee.” “I had not deem'd that aught remain'd below For me to prove of yet untasted woe; But thus to meet thee, Zayda! can impart One more, one keener agony of heart. Oh, hear me yet!—I would have died to save My foe, but still thy father, from the grave; But, in the fierce confusion of the strife, In my own stern despair, and scorn of life, Borne wildly on, I saw not, knew not aught, Save that to perish there in vain I sought. And let me share thy sorrows—hadst thou known All I have felt in silence and alone, E'en thou might'st then relent, and deem, at last, A grief like mine might expiate all the past. “But oh! for thee, the loved and precious flower, So fondly rear'd in luxury's guarded bower, From every danger, every storm secured, How hast thou suffer'd! what hast thou endured! Daughter of palaces! and can it be That this bleak desert is a home for thee! These rocks thy dwelling! thou, who shouldst have known Of life the sunbeam and the smile alone! Oh, yet forgive!—be all my guilt forgot, Nor bid me leave thee to so rude a lot!” “That lot is fix'd; 'twere fruitless to repine, Still must a gulf divide my fate from thine. I may forgive—but not at will the heart Can bid its dark remembrances depart. No, Hamet, no!—too deeply are these traced, Yet the hour comes when all shall be effaced! Not long on earth, not long, shall Zayda keep Her lonely vigils o'er the grave to weep: E'en now, prophetic of my early doom, Speaks to my soul a presage of the tomb; And ne'er in vain did hopeless mourner feel That deep foreboding o'er the bosom steal! Soon shall I slumber calmly by the side Of him for whom I lived, and would have died; Till then, one thought shall soothe my orphan lot, In pain and peril—I forsook him not. “And now, farewell!—behold the summer-day Is passing, like the dreams of life, away. Soon will the tribe of him who sleeps draw nigh, With the last rites his bier to sanctify. Oh, yet in time, away!—'twere not my prayer Could move their hearts a foe like thee to spare! This hour they come—and dost thou scorn to fly? Save me that one last pang—to see thee die!” E'en while she speaks is heard their echoing tread; Onward they move, the kindred of the dead. They reach the cave—they enter—slow their pace, And calm, deep sadness marks each mourner's face; And all is hush'd till he who seems to wait In silent, stern devotedness, his fate, Hath met their glance—then grief to fury turns; Each mien is changed, each eye indignant burns, And voices rise, and swords have left their sheath: Blood must atone for blood, and death for death! They close around him: lofty still his mien, His cheek unalter'd, and his brow serene. Unheard, or heard in vain, is Zayda's cry; Fruitless her prayer, unmark'd her agony. But as his foremost foes their weapons bend Against the life he seeks not to defend, Wildly she darts between—each feeling past, Save strong affection, which prevails at last. Oh! not in vain its daring—for the blow Aim'd at his heart hath bade her life-blood flow; And she hath sunk a martyr on the breast, Where, in that hour, her head may calmly rest, For he is saved:—behold the Zegri band, Pale with dismay and grief, around her stand: While, every thought of hate and vengeance o'er, They weep for her who soon shall weep no more. She, she alone is calm:—a fading smile, Like sunset, passes o'er her cheek the while; And in her eye, ere yet it closes, dwell Those last faint rays, the parting soul's farewell. “Now is the conflict past, and I have proved How well, how deeply, thou hast been beloved! Yes! in an hour like this 'twere vain to hide The heart so long and so severely tried: Still to thy name that heart hath fondly thrill'd, But sterner duties call'd—and were fulfill'd: And I am blest!—To every holier tie My life was faithful,—and for thee I die! Nor shall the love so purified be vain; Sever'd on earth, we yet shall meet again. Farewell!—And ye, at Zayda's dying prayer, Spare him, my kindred tribe! forgive and spare! Oh! be his guilt forgotten in his woes, While I, beside my sire, in peace repose.” Now fades her cheek, her voice hath sunk, and death Sits in her eye, and struggles in her breath. One pang—'tis past—her task on earth is done, And the pure spirit to its rest hath flown. But he for whom she died—Oh! who may paint The grief, to which all other woes were faint? There is no power in language to impart The deeper pangs, the ordeals of the heart, By the dread Searcher of the soul survey'd; These have no words—nor are by words portray'd. A dirge is rising on the mountain-air, Whose fitful swells its plaintive murmurs bear Far o'er the Alpuxarras;—wild its tone, And rocks and caverns echo, “Thou art gone!” Daughter of heroes! thou art gone To share his tomb who gave thee birth; Peace to the lovely spirit flown! It was not form'd for earth. Thou wert a sunbeam in thy race, Which brightly pass'd, and left no trace. But calmly sleep!—for thou art free, And hands unchain'd thy tomb shall raise. Sleep! they are closed at length for thee, Life's few and evil days! Nor shalt thou watch, with tearful eye, The lingering death of liberty. Flower of the desert! thou thy bloom Didst early to the storm resign: We bear it still—and dark their doom Who cannot weep for thine! For us, whose every hope is fled, The time is past to mourn the dead. The days have been, when o'er thy bier Far other strains than these had flow'd; Now, as a home from grief and fear, We hail thy dark abode! We, who but linger to bequeath Our sons the choice of chains or death. Thou art with those, the free, the brave, The mighty of departed years; And for the slumberers of the grave Our fate hath left no tears. Though loved and lost, to weep were vain For thee, who ne'er shalt weep again. Have we not seen, despoil'd by foes, The land our fathers won of yore? And is there yet a pang for those Who gaze on this no more? Oh, that like them 'twere ours to rest! Daughter of heroes! thou art blest! A few short years, and in the lonely cave Where sleeps the Zegri maid, is Hamet's grave. Sever'd in life, united in the tomb— Such, of the hearts that loved so well, the doom! Their dirge, of woods and waves th' eternal moan; Their sepulchre, the pine-clad rocks alone. And oft beside the midnight watch-fire's blaze, Amidst those rocks, in long departed days (When freedom fled, to hold, sequester'd there, The stern and lofty councils of despair,) Some exiled Moor, a warrior of the wild, Who the lone hours with mournful strains beguiled, Hath taught his mountain-home the tale of those Who thus have suffer'd, and who thus repose. THE WIDOW OF CRESCENTIUS. “L'orage peut briser en un moment les fleurs qui tiennent encore la tête levée. Mad. de Staël. [PART I.] 'Midst Tivoli's luxuriant glades, Bright-foaming falls, and olive shades, Where dwelt, in days departed long, The sons of battle and of song, No tree, no shrub its foliage rears, But o'er the wrecks of other years, Temples and domes, which long have been The soil of that enchanted scene. There the wild fig-tree and the vine O'er Hadrian's mouldering villa twine; The cypress, in funereal grace, Usurps the vanish'd column's place; O'er fallen shrine, and ruin'd frieze, The wall-flower rustles in the breeze; Acanthus-leaves the marble hide They once adorn'd, in sculptured pride, And nature hath resumed her throne O'er the vast works of ages flown. Was it for this that many a pile, Pride of Ilissus and of Nile, To Anio's banks the image lent Of each imperial monument? Now Athens weeps her shatter'd fanes, Thy temples, Egypt, strew thy plains; And the proud fabrics Hadrian rear'd From Tibur's vale have disappear'd. We need no prescient sibyl there The doom of grandeur to declare; Each stone, where weeds and ivy climb, Reveals some oracle of Time; Each relic utters Fate's decree, The future as the past shall be. Halls of the dead! in Tibur's vale, Who now shall tell your lofty tale? Who trace the high patrician's dome, The bard's retreat, the hero's home? When moss-clad wrecks alone record There dwelt the world's departed lord. In scenes where verdure's rich array Still sheds young beauty o'er decay, And sunshine on each glowing hill, Midst ruins finds a dwelling still. Sunk is thy palace—but thy tomb, Hadrian! hath shared a prouder doom, Though vanish'd with the days of old Its pillars of Corinthian mould; And the fair forms by sculpture wrought, Each bodying some immortal thought, Which o'er that temple of the dead, Serene, but solemn beauty shed, Have found, like glory's self, a grave In time's abyss, or Tiber's wave: Yet dreams more lofty, and more fair, Than art's bold hand hath imaged e'er, High thoughts of many a mighty mind, Expanding when all else declined, In twilight years, when only they Recall'd the radiance pass'd away, Have made that ancient pile their home, Fortress of freedom and of Rome. There he, who strove in evil days Again to kindle glory's rays, Whose spirit sought a path of light, For those dim ages far too bright,— Crescentius long maintain'd the strife Which closed but with its martyr's life, And left th' imperial tomb a name, A heritage of holier fame. There closed De Brescia's mission high, From thence the patriot came to die; And thou, whose Roman soul the last, Spoke with the voice of ages past, Whose thoughts so long from earth had fled, To mingle with the glorious dead, That midst the world's degenerate race They vainly sought a dwelling-place, Within that house of death didst brood O'er visions to thy ruin woo'd. Yet, worthy of a brighter lot, Rienzi, be thy faults forgot! For thou, when all around thee lay Chain'd in the slumbers of decay; So sunk each heart, that mortal eye Had scarce a tear for liberty; Alone, amidst the darkness there, Could'st gaze on Rome—yet not despair! 'Tis morn, and Nature's richest dyes Are floating o'er Italian skies; Tints of transparent lustre shine Along the snow-clad Apennine; The clouds have left Soracte's height, And yellow Tiber winds in light, Where tombs and fallen fanes have strew'd The wide Campagna's solitude. 'Tis sad amidst that scene to trace Those relics of a vanish'd race; Yet, o'er the ravaged path of time,— Such glory sheds that brilliant clime, Where Nature still, though empires fall, Holds her triumphant festival;— E'en Desolation wears a smile, Where skies and sunbeams laugh the while; And Heaven's own light, Earth's richest bloom, Array the ruin and the tomb. But she, who from yon convent tower Breathes the pure freshness of the hour; She, whose rich flow of raven hair Streams wildly on the morning air, Heeds not how fair the scene below, Robed in Italia's brightest glow. Though throned'midst Latium's classic plains Th' Eternal City's towers and fanes, And they, the Pleiades of earth, The seven proud hills of Empire's birth, Lie spread beneath: not now her glance Roves o'er that vast sublime expanse; Inspired, and bright with hope, 'tis thrown On Adrian's massy tomb alone: There, from the storm, when Freedom fled, His faithful few Crescentius led; While she, his anxious bride, who now Bends o'er the scene her youthful brow, Sought refuge in the hallow'd fane, Which then could shelter, not in vain. But now the lofty strife is o'er, And Liberty shall weep no more. At length imperial Otho's voice Bids her devoted sons rejoice; And he, who battled to restore The glories and the rights of yore, Whose accents, like the clarion's sound, Could burst the dead repose around, Again his native Rome shall see, The sceptred city of the free! And young Stephania waits the hour When leaves her lord his fortress-tower, Her ardent heart with joy elate, That seems beyond the reach of fate; Her mein, like creature from above, All vivified with hope and love. Fair is her form, and in her eye Lives all the soul of Italy; A meaning lofty and inspired, As by her native day-star fired; Such wild and high expression, fraught With glances of impassion'd thought, As fancy sheds, in visions bright, O'er priestess of the God of Light; And the dark locks that lend her face A youthful and luxuriant grace, Wave o'er her cheek, whose kindling dyes Seem from the fire within to rise; But deepen'd by the burning heaven To her own land of sunbeams given. Italian art that fervid glow Would o'er ideal beauty throw, And with such ardent life express Her high-wrought dreams of loveliness;— Dreams which, surviving Empire's fall, The shade of glory still recall. But see,—the banner of the brave O'er Adrian's tomb hath ceased to wave. 'Tis lower'd—and now Stephania's eye Can well the martial train descry, Who, issuing from that ancient dome, Pour through the crowded streets of Rome. Now from her watch-tower on the height, With step as fabled wood-nymph's light, She flies—and swift her way pursues, Through the lone convent's avenues. Dark cypress groves, and fields o'erspread With records of the conquering dead, And paths which track a glowing waste, She traverses in breathless haste; And by the tombs where dust is shrined, Once tenanted by loftiest mind, Still passing on, hath reach'd the gate Of Rome, the proud, the desolate! Throng'd are the streets, and, still renew'd, Rush on the gathering multitude. Is it their high-soul'd chief to greet, That thus the Roman thousands meet? With names that bid their thoughts ascend, Crescentius, thine in song to blend; And of triumphal days gone by Recall th' inspiring pageantry? —There is an air of breathless dread, An eager glance, a hurrying tread; And now a fearful silence round, And now a fitful murmuring sound, Midst the pale crowds, that almost seem Phantoms of some tumultuous dream. Quick is each step, and wild each mien, Portentous of some awful scene. Bride of Crescentius! as the throng Bore thee with whelming force along, How did thine anxious heart beat high, Till rose suspense to agony!— Too brief suspense, that soon shall close, And leave thy heart to deeper woes. Who'midst yon guarded precinct stands, With fearless mien, but fetter'd hands? The ministers of death are nigh, Yet a calm grandeur lights his eye; And in his glance there lives a mind, Which was not form'd for chains to bind, But cast in such heroic mould As theirs, th' ascendant ones of old. Crescentius! freedom's daring son, Is this the guerdon thou hast won? O worthy to have lived and died In the bright days of Latium's pride! Thus must the beam of glory close O'er the seven hills again that rose, When at thy voice, to burst the yoke, The soul of Rome indignant woke? Vain dream! the sacred shields are gone, Sunk is the crowning city's throne: Th' illusions, that around her cast Their guardian spells, have long been past. Thy life hath been a shot-star's ray, Shed o'er her midnight of decay; Thy death at freedom's ruin'd shrine Must rivet every chain—but thine. Calm is his aspect, and his eye Now fix'd upon the deep-blue sky, Now on those wrecks of ages fled, Around in desolation spread; Arch, temple, column, worn and grey, Recording triumphs pass'd away; Works of the mighty and the free, Whose steps on earth no more shall be, Though their bright course hath left a trace Nor years nor sorrows can efface. Why changes now the patriot's mien, Erewhile so loftily serene? Thus can approaching death control The might of that commanding soul? No!—Heard ye not that thrilling cry Which told of bitterest agony? He heard it, and at once subdued, Hath sunk the hero's fortitude. He heard it, and his heart too well Whence rose that voice of woe can tell; And midst the gazing throngs around One well-known form his glance hath found; One fondly loving and beloved, In grief, in peril, faithful proved. Yes, in the wildness of despair, She, his devoted bride, is there. Pale, breathless, through the crowd she flies, The light of frenzy in her eyes: But ere her arms can clasp the form, Which life ere long must cease to warm; Ere on his agonizing breast Her heart can heave, her head can rest; Check'd in her course by ruthless hands, Mute, motionless, at once she stands; With bloodless cheek and vacant glance, Frozen and fix'd in horror's trance; Spell-bound, as every sense were fled, And thought o'erwhelm'd, and feeling dead. And the light waving of her hair, And veil, far floating on the air, Alone, in that dread moment, show She is no sculptured form of woe. The scene of grief and death is o'er, The patriot's heart shall throb no more: But hers—so vainly form'd to prove The pure devotedness of love, And draw from fond affection's eye All thought sublime, all feeling high; When consciousness again shall wake, Hath now no refuge—but to break. The spirit long inured to pain May smile at fate in calm disdain; Survive its darkest hour, and rise In more majestic energies. But in the glow of vernal pride, If each warm hope at once hath died, Then sinks the mind, a blighted flower, Dead to the sunbeam and the shower; A broken gem, whose inborn light Is scatter'd—ne'er to re-unite. PART II. Hast thou a scene that is not spread With records of thy glory fled? A monument that doth not tell The tale of liberty's farewell? Italia! thou art but a grave Where flowers luxuriate o'er the brave, And nature gives her treasures birth O'er all that hath been great on earth. Yet smile thy heavens as once they smiled, When thou wert freedom's favour'd child: Though fane and tomb alike are low, Time hath not dimm'd thy sunbeam's glow; And, robed in that exulting ray, Thou seem'st to triumph o'er decay. Oh, yet, though by thy sorrows bent In nature's pomp magnificent; What marvel if, when all was lost, Still on thy bright, enchanted coast, Though many an omen warn'd him thence, Linger'd the lord of eloquence? Still gazing on the lovely sky, Whose radiance woo'd him—but to die: Like him who would not linger there, Where heaven, earth, ocean, all are fair? Who'midst thy glowing scenes could dwell, Nor bid awhile his griefs farewell? Hath not thy pure and genial air Balm for all sadness but despair? No! there are pangs, whose deep-worn trace Not all thy magic can efface! Hearts by unkindness wrung may learn, The world and all its gifts to spurn; Time may steal on with silent tread, And dry the tear that mourns the dead; May change fond love, subdue regret, And teach e'en vengeance to forget: But thou, Remorse! there is no charm, Thy sting, avenger, to disarm! Vain are bright suns and laughing skies, To soothe thy victim's agonies: The heart once made thy burning throne, Still, while it beats, is thine alone. In vain for Otho's joyless eye Smile the fair scenes of Italy, As through her landscapes' rich array Th' imperial pilgrim bends his way. Thy form, Crescentius, on his sight Rises when nature laughs in light, Glides round him at the midnight hour, Is present in his festal bower, With awful voice and frowning mien, By all but him unheard, unseen. Oh! thus to shadows of the grave Be every tyrant still a slave! Where through Gargano's woody dells, O'er bending oaks the north wind swells, A sainted hermit's lowly tomb Is bosom'd in umbrageous gloom, In shades that saw him live and die Beneath their waving canopy. 'Twas his, as legends tell, to share The converse of immortals there; Around that dweller of the wild There “bright appearances” have smiled, And angel-wings, at eve, have been Gleaming the shadowy boughs between. And oft from that secluded bower Hath breathed, at midnight's calmer hour, A swell of viewless harps, a sound Of warbled anthems pealing round. Oh, none but voices of the sky Might wake that thrilling harmony, Whose tones, whose very echoes made An Eden of the lonely shade! Years have gone by; the hermit sleeps Amidst Gargano's woods and steeps; Ivy and flowers have half o'ergrown, And veil'd his low, sepulchral stone: Yet still the spot is holy, still Celestial footsteps haunt the hill; And oft the awe-struck mountaineer Aërial vesper-hymns may hear Around those forest-precincts float, Soft, solemn, clear, but still remote. Oft will Affliction breathe her plaint To that rude shrine's departed saint, And deem that spirits of the blest There shed sweet influence o'er her breast. And thither Otho now repairs, To soothe his soul with vows and prayers; And if for him, on holy ground, The lost one, Peace, may yet be found, 'Midst rocks and forests, by the bed, Where calmly sleep the sainted dead, She dwells, remote from heedless eye, With Nature's lonely majesty. Vain, vain the search—his troubled breast Nor vow nor penance lulls to rest; The weary pilgrimage is o'er, The hopes that cheer'd it are no more. Then sinks his soul, and day by day Youth's buoyant energies decay. The light of health his eye hath flown, The glow that tinged his cheek is gone. Joyless as one on whom is laid Some baleful spell that bids him fade, Extending its mysterious power O'er every scene, o'er every hour; E'en thus he withers; and to him Italia's brilliant skies are dim. He withers—in that glorious clime Where Nature laughs in scorn of Time; And suns, that shed on all below Their full and vivifying glow, From him alone their power withhold, And leave his heart in darkness cold. Earth blooms around him, heaven is fair, He only seems to perish there. Yet sometimes will a transient smile Play o'er his faded cheek awhile, When breathes his minstrel-boy a strain Of power to lull all earthly pain; So wildly sweet, its notes might seem Th' ethereal music of a dream, A spirit's voice from worlds unknown, Deep thrilling power in every tone! Sweet is that lay, and yet its flow Hath language only given to woe; And if at times its wakening swell Some tale of glory seems to tell, Soon the proud notes of triumph die, Lost in a dirge's harmony: Oh! many a pang the heart hath proved, Hath deeply suffer'd, fondly loved, Ere the sad strain could catch from thence Such deep impassion'd eloquence!— Yes! gaze on him, that minstrel boy— He is no child of hope and joy! Though few his years, yet have they been Such as leave traces on the mein, And o'er the roses of our prime Breathe other blights than those of time. Yet seems his spirit wild and proud, By grief unsoften'd and unbow'd. Oh! there are sorrows which impart A sternness foreign to the heart, And, rushing with an earthquake's power, That makes a desert in an hour, Rouse the dread passions in their course, As tempests wake the billows' force!— 'Tis sad, on youthful Guido's face, The stamp of woes like these to trace. Oh! where can ruins awe mankind, Dark as the ruins of the mind? His mien is lofty, but his gaze Too well a wand'ring soul betrays: His full dark eye at times is bright With strange and momentary light, Whose quick uncertain flashes throw O'er his pale cheek a hectic glow: And oft his features and his air A shade of troubled mystery wear, A glance of hurried wildness, fraught With some unfathomable thought. Whate'er that thought, still, unexpress'd, Dwells the sad secret in his breast; The pride his haughty brow reveals, All other passion well conceals. He breathes each wounded feeling's tone, In music's eloquence alone; His soul's deep voice is only pour'd Through his full song and swelling chord. He seeks no friend, but shuns the train Of courtiers with a proud disdain; And, save when Otho bids his lay Its half unearthly power essay, In hall or bower the heart to thrill, His haunts are wild and lonely still. Far distant from the heedless throng, He roves old Tiber's banks along, Where Empire's desolate remains Lie scatter'd o'er the silent plains: Or, lingering midst each ruin'd shrine That strews the desert Palatine, With mournful, yet commanding mien, Like the sad genius of the scene, Entranced in awful thought appears To commune with departed years. Or, at the dead of night, when Rome Seems of heroic shades the home; When Tiber's murmuring voice recalls The mighty to their ancient halls; When hush'd is every meaner sound, And the deep moonlight-calm around Leaves to the solemn scene alone The majesty of ages flown; A pilgrim to each hero's tomb, He wanders through the sacred gloom; And,'midst those dwellings of decay, At times will breathe so sad a lay, So wild a grandeur in each tone, 'Tis like a dirge for empires gone! Awake thy pealing harp again, But breathe a more exulting strain, Young Guido! for awhile forgot Be the dark secrets of thy lot, And rouse th' inspiring soul of song To speed the banquet's hour along!— The feast is spread, and music's call Is echoing through the royal hall, And banners wave, and trophies shine, O'er stately guests in glittering line; And Otho seeks awhile to chase The thoughts he never can erase, And bid the voice, whose murmurs deep Rise like a spirit on his sleep, The still small voice of conscience die, Lost in the din of revelry. On his pale brow dejection lowers, But that shall yield to festal hours: A gloom is in his faded eye, But that from music's power shall fly: His wasted cheek is wan with care, But mirth shall spread fresh crimson there. Wake, Guido! wake thy numbers high, Strike the bold chord exultingly! And pour upon the enraptured ear Such strains as warriors love to hear! Let the rich mantling goblet flow, And banish all resembling woe; And, if a thought intrude, of power To mar the bright convivial hour, Still must its influence lurk unseen, And cloud the heart—but not the mien! Away, vain dream!—on Otho's brow, Still darker lower the shadows now; Changed are his features, now o'erspread With the cold paleness of the dead; Now crimson'd with a hectic dye, The burning flush of agony! His lip is quivering, and his breast Heaves with convulsive pangs oppress'd; Now his dim eye seems fix'd and glazed, And now to heaven in anguish raised; And as, with unavailing aid, Around him throng his guests dismay'd, He sinks—while scarce his struggling breath Hath power to falter—“This is death!” Then rush'd that haughty child of song, Dark Guido, through the awe-struck throng: Fill'd with a strange delirious light, His kindling eye shone wildly bright; And on the sufferer's mien awhile Gazing with stern vindictive smile, A feverish glow of triumph dyed His burning cheek, while thus he cried:— “Yes! these are death-pangs—on thy brow Is set the seal of vengeance now! Oh! well was mix'd the deadly draught, And long and deeply hast thou quaff'd; And bitter as thy pangs may be, They are but guerdons meet from me! Yet, these are but a moment's throes, Howe'er intense, they soon shall close. Soon shalt thou yield thy fleeting breath— My life hath been a lingering death; Since one dark hour of woe and crime, A blood-spot on the page of time! “Deem'st thou my mind of reason void? It is not frenzied,—but destroy'd! Aye! view the wreck with shuddering thought,— That work of ruin thou hast wrought! The secret of thy doom to tell, My name alone suffices well! Stephania!—once a hero's bride! Otho! thou know'st the rest—he died. Yes! trusting to a monarch's word, The Roman fell, untried, unheard! And thou, whose every pledge was vain, How couldst thou trust in aught again? “He died, and I was changed—my soul, A lonely wanderer, spurn'd control. From peace, and light, and glory hurl'd, The outcast of a purer world, I saw each brighter hope o'erthrown, And lived for one dread task alone. The task is closed—fulfill'd the vow, The hand of death is on thee now. Betrayer! in thy turn betray'd, The debt of blood shall soon be paid! Thine hour is come—the time hath been My heart had shrunk from such a scene; That feeling long is past—my fate Hath made me stern as desolate. “Ye that around me shuddering stand, Ye chiefs and princes of the land! Mourn ye a guilty monarch's doom? Ye wept not o'er the patriot's tomb! He sleeps unhonour'd—yet be mine To share his low, neglected shrine. His soul with freedom finds a home, His grave is that of glory—Rome! Are not the great of old with her, That city of the sepulchre? Lead me to death! and let me share The slumbers of the mighty there!” The day departs—that fearful day Fades in calm loveliness away: From purple heavens its lingering beam Seems melting into Tiber's stream, And softly tints each Roman hill With glowing light, as clear and still As if, unstain'd by crime or woe, Its hours had pass'd in silent flow. The day sets calmly—it hath been Mark'd with a strange and awful scene: One guilty bosom throbs no more, And Otho's pangs and life are o'er. And thou, ere yet another sun His burning race hath brightly run, Released from anguish by thy foes, Daughter of Rome! shalt find repose.— Yes! on thy country's lovely sky Fix yet once more thy parting eye! A few short hours—and all shall be The silent and the past for thee. Oh! thus with tempests of a day We struggle, and we pass away, Like the wild billows as they sweep, Leaving no vestige on the deep! And o'er thy dark and lowly bed The sons of future days shall tread, The pangs, the conflicts, of thy lot, By them unknown, by thee forgot. THE LAST BANQUET OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA. Thy foes had girt thee with their dread array, O stately Alexandria!—yet the sound Of mirth and music, at the close of day, Swell'd from thy splendid fabrics, far around O'er camp and wave. Within the royal hall, In gay magnificence the feast was spread; And, brightly streaming from the pictured wall, A thousand lamps their trembling lustre shed O'er many a column, rich with precious dyes, That tinge the marble's vein, 'neath Afric's burning skies. And soft and clear that wavering radiance play'd O'er sculptured forms, that round the pillar'd scene Calm and majestic rose, by art array'd In godlike beauty, awfully serene. Oh! how unlike the troubled guests, reclined Round that luxurious board!—in every face Some shadow from the tempest of the mind, Rising by fits, the searching eye might trace, Though vainly mask'd in smiles which are not mirth, But the proud spirit's veil thrown o'er the woes of earth. Their brows are bound with wreaths, whose transient bloom May still survive the wearers—and the rose Perchance may scarce be wither'd, when the tomb Receives the mighty to its dark repose! The day must dawn on battle, and may set In death—but fill the mantling wine-cup high! Despair is fearless, and the Fates e'en yet Lend her one hour for parting revelry. They who the empire of the world possess'd, Would taste its joys again, ere all exchanged for rest. Its joys! oh, mark yon proud triumvir's mien, And read their annals on that brow of care! 'Midst pleasure's lotus-bowers his steps have been; Earth's brightest pathway led him to despair. Trust not the glance that fain would yet inspire The buoyant energies of days gone by; There is delusion in its meteor-fire, And all within is shame, is agony! Away! the tear in bitterness may flow, But there are smiles which bear a stamp of deeper woe. Thy cheek is sunk, and faded as thy fame, O lost, devoted Roman! yet thy brow To that ascendant and undying name, Pleads with stern loftiness thy right e'en now. Thy glory is departed, but hath left A lingering light around thee—in decay Not less than kingly, though of all bereft, Thou seem'st as empire had not pass'd away. Supreme in ruin! teaching hearts elate, A deep, prophetic dread of still mysterious fate! But thou, enchantress-queen! whose love hath made His desolation—thou art by his side, In all thy sovereignty of charms array'd, To meet the storm with still unconquer'd pride. Imperial being! e'en though many a stain Of error be upon thee, there is power In thy commanding nature, which shall reign O'er the stern genius of misfortune's hour; And the dark beauty of thy troubled eye E'en now is all illumed with wild sublimity. Thine aspect, all impassion'd, wears a light Inspiring and inspired—thy cheek a dye, Which rises not from joy, but yet is bright With the deep glow of feverish energy. Proud siren of the Nile! thy glance is fraught With an immortal fire—in every beam It darts, there kindles some heroic thought, But wild and awful as a sybil's dream; For thou with death hast commun'd, to attain Dread knowledge of the pangs that ransom from the chain. And the stern courage by such musings lent, Daughter of Afric! o'er thy beauty throws The grandeur of a regal spirit, blent With all the majesty of mighty woes; While he, so fondly, fatally adored, Thy fallen Roman, gazes on thee yet, Till scarce the soul, that once exulting soar'd, Can deem the day-star of its glory set; Scarce his charm'd heart believes that power can be In sovereign fate, o'er him, thus fondly loved by thee. But there is sadness in the eyes around, Which mark that ruin'd leader, and survey His changeful mein, whence oft the gloom profound Strange triumph chases haughtily away. “Quaff, ere we part, the generous nectar deep! Ere sunset gild once more the western skies, Your chief, in cold forgetfulness, may sleep, While sounds of revel float o'er shore and sea, And the red bowl again is crown'd—but not for me “Yet weep not thus—the struggle is not o'er, O victors of Philippi! many a field Hath yielded palms to us:—one effort more, By one stern conflict must our doom be seal'd! Forget not, Romans! o'er a subject world How royally your eagle's wing hath spread, Though, from his eyrie of dominion hurl'd, Now bursts the tempest on his crested head! Yet sovereign still, if banish'd from the sky, The sun's indignant bird, he must not droop—but die.” The feast is o'er. 'Tis night, the dead of night— Unbroken stillness broods o'er earth and deep; From Egypt's heaven of soft and starry light The moon looks cloudless o'er a world of sleep: For those who wait the morn's awakening beams, The battle signal to decide their doom, Have sunk to feverish rest and troubled dreams; Rest, that shall soon be calmer in the tomb, Dreams, dark and ominous, but there to cease, When sleep the lords of war in solitude and peace. Wake, slumberers, wake! Hark! heard ye not a sound Of gathering tumult?—Near and nearer still Its murmur swells. Above, below, around, Bursts a strange chorus forth, confused and shrill. Wake, Alexandria! through thy streets the tread Of steps unseen is hurrying, and the note Of pipe, and lyre, and trumpet, wild and dread, Is heard upon the midnight air to float; And voices, clamorous as in frenzied mirth, Mingle their thousand tones, which are not of the earth. These are no mortal sounds—their thrilling strain Hath more mysterious power, and birth more high; And the deep horror chilling every vein Owns them of stern, terrific augury. Beings of worlds unknown! ye pass away, O ye invisible and awful throng! Your echoing footsteps and resounding lay To Cæsar's camp exulting move along. Thy gods forsake thee, Antony! the sky By that dread sign reveals thy doom—“Despair and die!” ALARIC IN ITALY. Heard ye the Gothic trumpet's blast? The march of hosts, as Alaric pass'd? His steps have track'd that glorious clime, The birth-place of heroic time; But he, in northern deserts bred, Spared not the living for the dead, Nor heard the voice, whose pleading cries From temple and from tomb arise. He pass'd—the light of burning fanes Hath been his torch o'er Grecian plains; And woke they not—the brave, the free, To guard their own Thermopylæ? And left they not their silent dwelling, When Scythia's note of war was swelling? No! where the bold Three Hundred slept, Sad freedom battled not—but wept! For nerveless then the Spartan's hand, And Thebes could rouse no Sacred Band; Nor one high soul from slumber broke, When Athens own'd the northern yoke. But was there none for thee to dare The conflict, scorning to despair? O city of the seven proud hills! Whose name e'en yet the spirit thrills, As doth a clarion's battle-call— Didst thou too, ancient empress, fall? Did no Camillus from the chain Ransom thy Capitol again? Oh! who shall tell the days to be, No patriot rose to bleed for thee? Heard ye the Gothic trumpet's blast? The march of hosts, as Alaric pass'd? That fearful sound, at midnight deep, Burst on the eternal city's sleep: How woke the mighty? She, whose will So long had bid the world be still, Her sword a sceptre, and her eye Th' ascendant star of destiny! She woke—to view the dread array Of Scythians rushing to their prey, To hear her streets resound the cries Pour'd from a thousand agonies! While the strange light of flames, that gave A ruddy glow to Tiber's wave, Bursting in that terrific hour From fane and palace, dome and tower, Reveal'd the throngs, for aid divine Clinging to many a worshipp'd shrine: Fierce fitful radiance wildly shed O'er spear and sword, with carnage red, Shone o'er the suppliant and the flying, And kindled pyres for Romans dying. Weep, Italy! alas! that e'er Should tears alone thy wrongs declare! The time hath been when thy distress Had roused up empires for redress! Now, her long race of glory run, Without a combat Rome is won, And from her plunder'd temples forth Rush the fierce children of the north, To share beneath more genial skies Each joy their own rude clime denies. Ye who on bright Campania's shore Bade your fair villas rise of yore, With all their graceful colonnades, And crystal baths, and myrtle shades, Along the blue Hesperian deep, Whose glassy waves in sunshine sleep; Beneath your olive and your vine Far other inmates now recline, And the tall plane, whose roots ye fed With rich libations duly shed, O'er guests, unlike your vanish'd friends, Its bowery canopy extends. For them the southern heaven is glowing, The bright Falernian nectar flowing; For them the marble halls unfold, Where nobler beings dwelt of old, Whose children for barbarian lords Touch the sweet lyre's resounding chords, Or wreaths of Pæstan roses twine, To crown the sons of Elbe and Rhine. Yet, though luxurious they repose Beneath Corinthian porticoes, While round them into being start The marvels of triumphant art; Oh! not for them hath genius given To Parian stone the fire of heaven, Enshrining in the forms he wrought A bright eternity of thought. In vain the natives of the skies In breathing marble round them rise, And sculptured nymphs of fount or glade People the dark-green laurel shade; Cold are the conqueror's heart and eye To visions of divinity; And rude his hand which dares deface The models of immortal grace. Arouse ye from your soft delights! Chieftains! the war-note's call invites; And other lands must yet be won, And other deeds of havoc done. Warriors! your flowery bondage break, Sons of the stormy north, awake! The barks are launching from the steep, Soon shall the Isle of Ceres weep, And Afric's burning winds afar Waft the shrill sounds of Alaric's war. Where shall his race of victory close? When shall the ravaged earth repose? But hark! what wildly mingling cries From Scythia's camp tumultuous rise? Why swells dread Alaric's name on air? A sterner conqueror hath been there! A conqueror—yet his paths are peace, He comes to bring the world's release; He of the sword that knows no sheath, Th' avenger, the deliverer—Death! Is then that daring spirit fled? Doth Alaric slumber with the dead? Tamed are the warrior's pride and strength, And he and earth are calm at length. The land where heaven unclouded shines, Where sleep the sunbeams on the vines; The land by conquest made his own, Can yield him now—a grave alone. But his—her lord from Alp to sea— No common sepulchre shall be! Oh, make his tomb where mortal eye Its buried wealth may ne'er descry! Where mortal foot may never tread Above a victor-monarch's bed. Let not his royal dust be hid 'Neath star-aspiring pyramid; Nor bid the gather'd mound arise, To bear his memory to the skies. Years roll away—oblivion claims Her triumph o'er heroic names; And hands profane disturb the clay That once was fired with glory's ray; And Avarice, from their secret gloom, Drags e'en the treasures of the tomb. But thou, O leader of the free! That general doom awaits not thee: Thou, where no step may e'er intrude, Shalt rest in regal solitude, Till, bursting on thy sleep profound, Th' Awakener's final trumpet sound. Turn ye the waters from their course, Bid Nature yield to human force, And hollow in the torrent's bed A chamber for the mighty dead. The work is done—the captive's hand Hath well obey'd his lord's command. Within that royal tomb are cast The richest trophies of the past, The wealth of many a stately dome, The gold and gems of plunder'd Rome; And when the midnight stars are beaming, And ocean waves in stillness gleaming, Stern in their grief, his warriors bear The Chastener of the Nations there; To rest, at length, from victory's toil, Alone, with all an empire's spoil! Then the freed current's rushing wave Rolls o'er the secret of the grave; Then streams the martyr'd captives' blood To crimson that sepulchral flood, Whose conscious tide alone shall keep The mystery in its bosom deep. Time hath past on since then—and swept From earth the urns where heroes slept; Temples of gods, and domes of kings, Are mouldering with forgotten things; Yet shall not ages e'er molest The viewless home of Alaric's rest: Still rolls, like them, th' unfailing river, The guardian of his dust for ever. THE WIFE OF ASDRUBAL. The sun sets brightly—but a ruddier glow O'er Afric's heaven the flames of Carthage throw; Her walls have sunk, and pyramids of fire In lurid splendour from her domes aspire; Sway'd by the wind, they wave—while glares the sky As when the desert's red simoom is nigh; The sculptured altar, and the pillar'd hall, Shine out in dreadful brightness ere they fall; Far o'er the seas the light of ruin streams, Rock, wave, and isle are crimson'd by its beams; While captive thousands, bound in Roman chains, Gaze in mute horror on their burning fanes; And shouts of triumph, echoing far around, Swell from the victors' tents with ivy crown'd. It was a Roman custom to adorn the tents of victors with ivy. But mark! from yon fair temple's loftiest height What towering form bursts wildly on the sight, All regal in magnificent attire, And sternly beauteous in terrific ire? She might be deem'd a Pythia in the hour Of dread communion and delirious power; A being more than earthly, in whose eye There dwells a strange and fierce ascendancy. The flames are gathering round—intensely bright, Full on her features glares their meteor-light; But a wild courage sits triumphant there, The stormy grandeur of a proud despair; A daring spirit, in its woes elate, Mightier than death, untameable by fate. The dark profusion of her locks unbound, Waves like a warrior's floating plumage round; Flush'd is her cheek, inspired her haughty mien, She seems th' avenging goddess of the scene. Are those her infants, that with suppliant cry Cling round her, shrinking as the flame draws nigh, Clasp with their feeble hands her gorgeous vest, And fain would rush for shelter to her breast? Is that a mother's glance, where stern disdain, And passion, awfully vindictive, reign? Fix'd is her eye on Asdrubal, who stands Ignobly safe amidst the conquering bands; On him who left her to that burning tomb, Alone to share her children's martyrdom; Who, when his country perish'd, fled the strife, And knelt to win the worthless boon of life. “Live, traitor, live!” she cries, “since dear to thee E'en in thy fetters, can existence be! Scorn'd and dishonour'd live!—with blasted name, The Roman's triumph not to grace, but shame. O slave in spirit! bitter be thy chain With tenfold anguish to avenge my pain! Still may the manes of thy children rise To chase calm slumber from thy wearied eyes; Still may their voices on the haunted air In fearful whispers tell thee to despair, Till vain remorse thy wither'd heart consume, Scourged by relentless shadows of the tomb! E'en now my sons shall die—and thou, their sire, In bondage safe, shalt yet in them expire. Think'st thou I love them not?—'Twas thine to fly— 'Tis mine with these to suffer and to die. Behold their fate!—the arms that cannot save Have been their cradle, and shall be their grave.” Bright in her hand the lifted dagger gleams, Swift from her children's hearts the life-blood streams; With frantic laugh she clasps them to the breast Whose woes and passions soon shall be at rest; Lifts one appealing, frenzied glance on high, Then deep 'midst rolling flames is lost to mortal eye. HELIODORUS IN THE TEMPLE. A sound of woe in Salem!—mournful cries Rose from her dwellings—youthful cheeks were pale, Tears flowing fast from dim and aged eyes, And voices mingling in tumultuous wail; Hands raised to heaven in agony of prayer, And powerless wrath, and terror, and despair. Thy daughters, Judah! weeping, laid aside The regal splendour of their fair array, With the rude sackcloth girt their beauty's pride, And throng'd the streets in hurrying, wild dismay; While knelt thy priests before His awful shrine, Who made, of old, renown and empire thine. But on the spoiler moves—the temple's gate, The bright, the beautiful, his guards unfold; And all the scene reveals its solemn state, Its courts and pillars, rich with sculptured gold; And man, with eye unhallow'd, views th' abode, The sever'd spot, the dwelling-place of God. Where art thou, Mighty Presence! that of yore Wert wont between the cherubim to rest, Veil'd in a cloud of glory, shadowing o'er Thy sanctuary the chosen and the blest? Thou! that didst make fair Sion's ark thy throne, And call the oracle's recess thine own! Angel of God! that through the Assyrian host, Clothed with the darkness of the midnight-hour, To tame the proud, to hush th' invader's boast, Didst pass triumphant in avenging power, Till burst the day-spring on the silent scene, And death alone reveal'd where thou hadst been Wilt thou not wake, O Chastener! in thy might, To guard thine ancient and majestic hill, Where oft from heaven the full Shechinah's light Hath stream'd the house of holiness to fill? Oh! yet once more defend thy lov'd domain, Eternal one! Deliverer! rise again! Fearless of thee, the plunderer, undismay'd, Hastes on, the sacred chambers to explore Where the bright treasures of the fane are laid, The orphan's portion, and the widow's store; What recks his heart though age unsuccour'd die, And want consume the cheek of infancy? Away, intruders!—hark! a mighty sound! Behold, a burst of light!—away, away! A fearful glory fills the temple round, A vision bright in terrible array! And lo! a steed of no terrestrial frame, His path a whirlwind, and his breath a flame! His neck is clothed with thunder “Hast thou given the horse strength? Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?”—Job, chap. xxxix. v. 19.—and his mane Seems waving fire—the kindling of his eye Is as a meteor—ardent with disdain His glance—his gesture, fierce in majesty! Instinct with light he seems, and formed to bear Some dread archangel through the fields of air. But who is he, in panoply of gold, Throned on that burning charger? bright his form. Yet in its brightness awful to behold, And girt with all the terrors of the storm! Lightning is on his helmet's crest—and fear Shrinks from the splendour of his brow severe. And by his side two radiant warriors stand All-arm'd, and kingly in commanding grace— Oh! more than kingly—godlike!—sternly grand Their port indignant, and each dazzling face Beams with the beauty to immortals given Magnificent in all the wrath of heaven. Then sinks each gazer's heart—each knee is bow'd In trembling awe—but, as to fields of fight, Th' unearthly war-steed, rushing through the crowd, Bursts on their leader in terrific might; And the stern angels of that dread abode Pursue its plunderer with the scourge of God. Darkness—thick darkness!—low on earth he lies, Rash Heliodorus—motionless and pale— Bloodless his cheek, and o'er his shrouded eyes Mists, as of death, suspend their shadowy veil; And thus th' oppressor, by his fear-struck train, Is borne from that inviolable fane. The light returns—the warriors of the sky Have pass'd, with all their dreadful pomp, away; Then wakes the timbrel, swells the song on high Triumphant as in Judah's elder day; Rejoice, O city of the sacred hill! Salem, exult! thy God is with thee still. NIGHT-SCENE IN GENOA. In Genoa, when the sunset gave Its last warm purple to the wave, No sound of war, no voice of fear, Was heard, announcing danger near: Though deadliest foes were there, whose hate But slumber'd till its hour of fate, Yet calmly, at the twilight's close, Sunk the wide city to repose. But when deep midnight reign'd around, All sudden woke the alarm-bell's sound, Full swelling, while the hollow breeze Bore its dread summons o'er the seas. Then, Genoa, from their slumber started Thy sons, the free, the fearless-hearted; Then mingled with th' awakening peal Voices, and steps, and clash of steel. Arm, warriors, arm! for danger calls, Arise to guard your native walls! With breathless haste the gathering throng Hurry the echoing streets along; Through darkness rushing to the scene Where their bold counsels still convene. —But there a blaze of torches bright Pours its red radiance on the night, O'er fane, and dome, and column playing, With every fitful night-wind swaying: Now floating o'er each tall arcade, Around the pillar'd scene display'd, In light relieved by depth of shade: And now, with ruddy meteor-glare, Full streaming on the silvery hair And the bright cross of him who stands Rearing that sign with suppliant hands, Girt with his consecrated train, The hallow'd servants of the fane. Of life's past woes, the fading trace Hath given that aged patriarch's face Expression holy, deep, resign'd, The calm sublimity of mind. Years o'er his snowy head have pass'd, And left him of his race the last; Alone on earth—yet still his mien Is bright with majesty serene; And those high hopes, whose guiding-star Shines from th' eternal worlds afar, Have with that light illumed his eye, Whose fount is immortality, And o'er his features pour'd a ray Of glory, not to pass away. He seems a being who hath known Communion with his God alone, On earth by nought but pity's tie Detain'd a moment from on high! One to sublimer worlds allied, One, from all passion purified, E'en now half mingled with the sky, And all prepared—oh! not to die— But, like the prophet, to aspire, In heaven's triumphal car of fire. He speaks—and from the throngs around Is heard not e'en a whisper'd sound; A we-struck each heart, and fix'd each glance, They stand as in a spell-bound trance: He speaks—oh! who can hear nor own The might of each prevailing tone? “Chieftains and warriors! ye, so long Aroused to strife by mutual wrong, Whose fierce and far-transmitted hate Hath made your country desolate; Now by the love ye bear her name, By that pure spark of holy flame On freedom's altar brightly burning, But, once extinguish'd, ne'er returning; By all your hopes of bliss to come When burst the bondage of the tomb: By Him, the God who bade us live To aid each other, and forgive— I call upon ye to resign Your discords at your country's shrine, Each ancient feud in peace atone, Wield your keen swords for her alone, And swear upon the cross, to cast Oblivion's mantle o'er the past!” No voice replies—the holy bands Advance to where yon chieftain stands. With folded arms, and brow of gloom O'ershadow'd by his floating plume. To him they lift the cross—in vain He turns—oh! say not with disdain, But with a mien of haughty grief, That seeks not, e'en from heaven, relief: He rends his robes—he sternly speaks— Yet tears are on the warrior's cheeks. “Father! not thus the wounds may close Inflicted by eternal foes. Deem'st thou thy mandate can efface The dread volcano's burning trace? Or bid the earthquake's ravaged scene Be, smiling, as it once hath been? No! for the deeds the sword hath done Forgiveness is not lightly won; The words, by hatred spoke, may not Be, as a summer breeze, forgot! 'Tis vain—we deem the war-feud's rage A portion of our heritage. Leaders, now slumbering with their fame, Bequeath'd us that undying flame; Hearts that have long been still and cold Yet rule us from their silent mould; And voices, heard on earth no more, Speak to our spirits as of yore. Talk not of mercy—blood alone The stain of bloodshed may atone; Nought else can pay that mighty debt, The dead forbid us to forget.” He pauses—from the patriarch's brow There beams more lofty grandeur now; His reverend form, his aged hand, Assume a gesture of command, His voice is awful, and his eye Fill'd with prophetic majesty. “The dead!—and deem'st thou they retain Aught of terrestrial passion's stain? Of guilt incurr'd in days gone by, Aught but the fearful penalty? And say'st thou, mortal! blood alone For deeds of slaughter may atone? There hath been blood—by Him 'twas shed To expiate every crime who bled; Th' absolving God who died to save, And rose in victory from the grave! And by that stainless offering given Alike for all on earth to heaven; By that inevitable hour When death shall vanquish pride and power, And each departing passion's force Concentrate all in late remorse; And by the day when doom shall be Pass'd on earth's millions, and on thee— The doom that shall not be repeal'd, Once utter'd, and for ever seal'd— I summon thee, O child of clay! To cast thy darker thoughts away, And meet thy foes in peace and love, As thou would'st join the blest above.” Still as he speaks, unwonted feeling Is o'er the chieftain's bosom stealing; Oh! not in vain the pleading cries Of anxious thousands round him rise; He yields—devotion's mingled sense Of faith, and fear, and penitence, Pervading all his soul, he bows To offer on the cross his vows, And that best incense to the skies, Each evil passion's sacrifice. Then tears from warriors' eyes were flowing, High hearts with soft emotions glowing; Stern foes as long-loved brothers greeting, And ardent throngs in transport meeting; And eager footsteps forward pressing, And accents loud in joyous blessing; And when their first wild tumults cease, A thousand voices echo “Peace!” Twilight's dim mist hath roll'd away, And the rich Orient burns with day: Then as to greet the sunbeam's birth, Rises the choral hymn of earth; Th' exulting strain through Genoa swelling, Of peace and holy rapture telling. Far float the sounds o'er vale and steep, The seaman hears them on the deep, So mellow'd by the gale, they seem As the wild music of a dream; But not on mortal ear alone Peals the triumphant anthem's tone; For beings of a purer sphere Bend with celestial joy, to hear. THE TROUBADOUR, AND RICHARD CŒUR DE LION. The Troubadour o'er many a plain Hath roam'd unwearied, but in vain: O'er many a rugged mountain-scene, And forest-wild, his track hath been; Beneath Calabria's glowing sky He hath sung the songs of chivalry; His voice hath swell'd on the Alpine breeze, And rung through the snowy Pyrenees: From Ebro's banks to Danube's wave, He hath sought his prince, the loved, the brave, And yet, if still on earth thou art, Oh, monarch of the lion-heart! The faithful spirit, which distress But heightens to devotedness, By toil and trial vanquish'd not, Shall guide thy minstrel to the spot. He hath reach'd a mountain hung with vine, And woods that wave o'er the lovely Rhine: The feudal towers that crest its height Frown in unconquerable might; Dark is their aspect of sullen state— No helmet hangs o'er the massy gate To bid the wearied pilgrim rest, At the chieftain's board a welcome guest; Vainly rich evening's parting smile Would chase the gloom of the haughty pile, That 'midst bright sunshine lowers on high, Like a thunder-cloud in a summer sky Not these the halls where a child of song Awhile may speed the hours along; Their echoes should repeat alone The tyrant's mandate, the prisoner's moan, Or the wild huntsman's bugle blast, When his phantom-train are hurrying past. The weary minstrel paused—his eye Roved o'er the scene despondingly: Within the length'ning shadow, cast By the fortress-towers and ramparts vast, Lingering he gazed—the rocks around Sublime in savage grandeur frown'd; Proud guardians of the regal flood, In giant strength the mountains stood; By torrents cleft, by tempests riven, Yet mingling still with the calm blue heaven. Their peaks were bright with a sunny glow, But the Rhine all shadowy roll'd below; In purple tints the vineyards smiled, But the woods beyond waved dark and wild; Nor pastoral pipe, nor convent's bell, Was heard on the sighing breeze to swell; But all was lonely, silent, rude, A stern, yet glorious solitude. But hark! that solemn stillness breaking, The Troubadour's wild song is waking. Full oft that song, in days gone by, Hath cheer'd the sons of chivalry; It hath swell'd o'er Judah's mountains lone, Hermon! thy echoes have learn'd its tone; On the Great Plain its notes have rung, The leagued Crusaders' tents among; 'Twas loved by the Lion-heart, who won The palm in the field of Ascalon; And now afar o'er the rocks of Rhine Peals the bold strain of Palestine. THE TROUBADOUR'S SONG. “Thine hour is come, and the stake is set,” The Soldan cried to the captive knight, “And the sons of the Prophet in throngs are met To gaze on the fearful sight. “But be our faith by thy lips profess'd, The faith of Mecca's shrine, Cast down the red-cross that marks thy vest, And life shall yet be thine.” “I have seen the flow of my bosom's blood, And gazed with undaunted eye; I have borne the bright cross through fire and flood, And think'st thou I fear to die? “I have stood where thousands, by Salem's towers, Have fall'n for the name divine; And the faith that cheer'd their closing hours Shall be the light of mine.” “Thus wilt thou die in the pride of health, And the glow of youth's fresh bloom? Thou art offer'd life, and pomp, and wealth, Or torture and the tomb.” “I have been where the crown of thorns was twined For a dying Saviour's brow; He spurn'd the treasures that lure mankind, And I reject them now!” “Art thou the son of a noble line In a land that is fair and blest? And doth not thy spirit, proud captive! pine, Again on its shores to rest? “Thine own is the choice to hail once more The soil of thy father's birth, Or to sleep, when thy lingering pangs are o'er, Forgotten in foreign earth.” “Oh! fair are the vine-clad hills that rise In the country of my love; But yet, though cloudless my native skies, There's a brighter clime above!” The bard hath paused—for another tone Blends with the music of his own; And his heart beats high with hope again, As a well-known voice prolongs the strain. “Are there none within thy father's hall, Far o'er the wide blue main, Young Christian! left to deplore thy fall, With sorrow deep and vain?” “There are hearts that still, through all the past, Unchanging have loved me well; There are eyes whose tears were streaming fast When I bade my home farewell. “Better they wept o'er the warrior's bier Than th' apostate's living stain: There's a land where those who loved when here, Shall meet to love again.” 'Tis he! thy prince—long sought, long lost, The leader of the red-cross host! 'Tis he!—to none thy joy betray, Young Troubadour! away, away! Away to the island of the brave, The gem on the bosom of the wave; Arouse the sons of the noble soil, To win their Lion from the toil; And free the wassail-cup shall flow, Bright in each hall the hearth shall glow; The festal board shall be richly crown'd, While knights and chieftains revel round, And a thousand harps with joy shall ring, When merry England hails her king. THE DEATH OF CONRADIN. No cloud to dim the splendour of the day Which breaks o'er Naples and her lovely bay, And lights that brilliant sea and magic shore With every tint that charm'd the great of yore; Th' imperial ones of earth—who proudly bade Their marble domes e'en Ocean's realm invade. That race is gone—but glorious Nature here Maintains unchanged her own sublime career, And bids these regions of the sun display Bright hues, surviving empires pass'd away. The beam of Heaven expands—its kindling smile Reveals each charm of many a fairy isle, Whose image floats, in softer colouring drest, With all its rocks and vines, on Ocean's breast. Misenum's cape hath caught the vivid ray, On Roman streamers there no more to play; Still, as of old, unalterably bright, Lovely it sleeps on Posilippo's height, With all Italia's sunshine to illume The ilex canopy of Virgil's tomb. Campania's plains rejoice in light, and spread Their gay luxuriance o'er the mighty dead; Fair glittering to thine own transparent skies, Thy palaces, exulting Naples! rise; While, far on high, Vesuvius rears his peak, Furrow'd and dark with many a lava streak. Oh, ye bright shores of Circe and the Muse! Rich with all Nature's and all fiction's hues; Who shall explore your regions, and declare The poet err'd to paint Elysium there? Call up his spirit, wanderer! bid him guide Thy steps, those siren-haunted seas beside; And all the scene a lovelier light shall wear, And spells more potent shall pervade the air. What though his dust be scatter'd, and his urn Long from its sanctuary of slumber torn, Still dwell the beings of his verse around, Hovering in beauty o'er th' enchanted ground: His lays are murmur'd in each breeze that roves Soft o'er the sunny waves and orange-groves; His memory's charm is spread o'er shore and sea, The soul, the genius of Parthenope; Shedding o'er myrtle shade and vine-clad hill The purple radiance of Elysium still. Yet that fair soil and calm resplendent sky Have witness'd many a dark reality. Oft o'er those bright blue seas the gale hath borne The sighs of exiles never to return. There with the whisper of Campania's gale Hath mingled oft affection's funeral-wail, Mourning for buried heroes—while to her That glowing land was but their sepulchre. And there of old, the dread mysterious moan Swell'd from strange voices of no mortal tone; And that wild trumpet, whose unearthly note Was heard, at midnight, o'er the hills to float Around the spot where Agrippina died, Denouncing vengeance on the matricide. Pass'd are those ages—yet another crime, Another woe, must stain th' Elysian clime. There stands a scaffold on the sunny shore— It must be crimson'd ere the day is o'er! There is a throne in regal pomp array'd,— A scene of death from thence must be survey'd. Mark'd ye the rushing throngs?—each mien is pale, Each hurried glance reveals a fearful tale; But the deep workings of th' indignant breast, Wrath, hatred, pity, must be all suppress'd; The burning tear awhile must check its course, Th' avenging thought concentrate all its force; For tyranny is near, and will not brook Aught but submission in each guarded look. Girt with his fierce Provencals, and with mien Austere in triumph, gazing on the scene, And in his eye a keen suspicious glance Of jealous pride and restless vigilance, Behold the conqueror!—vainly in his face, Of gentler feeling hope would seek a trace: Cold, proud, severe, the spirit which hath lent Its haughty stamp to each dark lineament; And pleading mercy, in the sternness there, May read at once her sentence—to despair! But thou, fair boy! the beautiful, the brave, Thus passing from the dungeon to the grave, While all is yet around thee which can give A charm to earth, and make it bliss to live; Thou on whose form hath dwelt a mother's eye, Till the deep love that not with thee shall die Hath grown too full for utterance—Can it be? And is this pomp of death prepared for thee? Young, royal Conradin! who should'st have known Of life as yet the sunny smile alone! Oh! who can view thee, in the pride and bloom Of youth, array'd so richly for the tomb, Nor feel, deep swelling in his inmost soul, Emotions tyranny may ne'er control? Bright victim! to Ambition's altar led, Crown'd with all flowers that heaven on earth can shed, Who, from th' oppressor towering in his pride, May hope for mercy—if to thee denied? There is dead silence on the breathless throng, Dead silence all the peopled shore along, As on the captive moves—the only sound, To break that calm so fearfully profound, The low, sweet murmur of the rippling wave, Soft as it glides, the smiling shore to lave; While on that shore, his own fair heritage, The youthful martyr to a tyrant's rage Is passing to his fate: the eyes are dim Which gaze, through tears that dare not flow, on him. He mounts the scaffold—doth his footstep fail? Doth his lip quiver? doth his cheek turn pale? Oh! it may be forgiven him if a thought Cling to that world, for him with beauty fraught, To all the hopes that promised glory's meed, And all th' affections that with him shall bleed! If, in his life's young dayspring, while the rose Of boyhood on his cheek yet freshly glows, One human fear convulse his parting breath, And shrink from all the bitterness of death! But no! the spirit of his royal race Sits brightly on his brow—that youthful face Beams with heroic beauty, and his eye Is eloquent with injured majesty. He kneels—but not to man—his heart shall own Such deep submission to his God alone! And who can tell with what sustaining power That God may visit him in fate's dread hour? How the still voice, which answers every moan, May speak of hope—when hope on earth is gone? That solemn pause is o'er—the youth hath given One glance of parting love to earth and heaven: The sun rejoices in th' unclouded sky, Life all around him glows—and he must die! Yet 'midst his people, undismay'd, he throws The gage of vengeance for a thousand woes; Vengeance, that, like their own volcano's fire, May sleep suppress'd a while—but not expire. One softer image rises o'er his breast, One fond regret, and all shall be at rest! “Alas, for thee, my mother! who shall bear To thy sad heart the tidings of despair, When thy lost child is gone?”—that thought can thrill His soul with pangs one moment more shall still. The lifted axe is glittering in the sun— It falls—the race of Conradin is run! Yet, from the blood which flows that shore to stain, A voice shall cry to heaven—and not in vain! Gaze thou, triumphant from thy gorgeous throne, In proud supremacy of guilt alone, Charles of Anjou!—but that dread voice shall be A fearful summoner e'en yet to thee! The scene of death is closed—the throngs depart, A deep stern lesson graved on every heart. No pomp, no funeral rites, no streaming eyes, High-minded boy! may grace thine obsequies. O, vainly royal and beloved! thy grave, Unsanctified, is bathed by Ocean's wave; Mark'd by no stone, a rude, neglected spot, Unhonour'd, unadorn'd—but unforgot; For thy deep wrongs in tameless hearts shall live, Now mutely suffering—never to forgive! The sunset fades from purple heavens away— A bark hath anchor'd in th' unruffled bay; Thence on the beach descends a female form, Her mien with hope and tearful transport warm; But life hath left sad traces on her cheek, And her soft eyes a chasten'd heart bespeak, Inured to woes—yet what were all the past! She sunk not feebly 'neath affliction's blast, While one bright hope remain'd—who now shall tell Th' uncrown'd, the widow'd, how her loved one fell? To clasp her child, to ransom and to save, The mother came—and she hath found his grave! And by that grave, transfix'd in speechless grief, Whose deathlike trance denies a tear's relief, Awhile she kneels—till roused at length to know, To feel the might, the fulness of her woe, On the still air a voice of anguish wild, A mother's cry is heard—“My Conradin! my child!” THE RESTORATION OF THE WORKS OF ART TO ITALY. Italia, Italia! O tu cui die la sorte Dono infelice di bellezza, ond' hai Funesta dote d'infiniti guai, Ch'en fronte scritte per gran doglia porte; Deh, fossi tu men bella, o almen piu forte. Filicaja. Land of departed fame! whose classic plains Have proudly echo'd to immortal strains; Whose hallow'd soil hath given the great and brave, Daystars of life, a birth-place and a grave; Home of the Arts! where glory's faded smile, Sheds ling'ring light o'er many a mould'ring pile; Proud wreck of vanish'd power, of splendour fled, Majestic temple of the mighty dead! Whose grandeur, yet contending with decay, Gleams through the twilight of thy glorious day; Though dimm'd thy brightness, riveted thy chain, Yet, fallen Italy! rejoice again! Lost, lovely realm! once more 'tis thine to gaze On the rich relics of sublimer days. Awake, ye Muses of Etrurian shades, Or sacred Tivoli's romantic glades; Wake, ye that slumber in the bowery gloom Where the wild ivy shadows Virgil's tomb; Or ye, whose voice, by Sorga's lonely wave, Swell'd the deep echoes of the fountain's cave, Or thrill'd the soul in Tasso's numbers high, Those magic strains of love and chivalry: If yet by classic streams ye fondly rove, Haunting the myrtle vale, the laurel grove; Oh! rouse once more the daring soul of song, Seize with bold hand the harp, forgot so long, And hail, with wonted pride, those works revered Hallow'd by time, by absence more endear'd. And breathe to Those the strain, whose warriormight Each danger stemm'd, prevail'd in every fight; Souls of unyielding power, to storms inured, Sublimed by peril, and by toil matured. Sing of that Leader, whose ascendant mind Could rouse the slumb'ring spirit of mankind: Whose banners track'd the vanquish'd Eagle's flight O'er many a plain, and dark sierra's height; Who bade once more the wild, heroic lay, Record the deeds of Roncesvalles' day; Who, through each mountain-pass of rock and snow, An Alpine huntsman chased the fear-struck foe; Waved his proud standard to the balmy gales, Rich Languedoc! that fan thy glowing vales, And 'midst those scenes renew'd th' achievements high, Bequeath'd to fame by England's ancestry. Yet, when the storm seem'd hush'd, the conflict past, One strife remain'd—the mightiest and the last! Nerved for the struggle, in that fateful hour Untamed Ambition summon'd all his power; Vengeance and Pride, to frenzy roused, were there, And the stern might of resolute Despair. Isle of the free! 'twas then thy champions stood, Breasting unmoved the combat's wildest flood; Sunbeam of battle! then thy spirit shone, Glow'd in each breast, and sunk with life alone. Oh hearts devoted! whose illustrious doom Gave there at once your triumph and your tomb, Ye, firm and faithful, in the ordeal tried Of that dread strife, by Freedom sanctified; Shrined, not entomb'd, ye rest in sacred earth, Hallow'd by deeds of more than mortal worth. What though to mark where sleeps heroic dust, No sculptured trophy rise, or breathing bust, Yours, on the scene where valour's race was run, A prouder sepulchre—the field ye won! There every mead, each cabin's lowly name, Shall live a watchword blended with your fame; And well may flowers suffice those graves to crown That ask no urn to blazon their renown! There shall the bard in future ages tread, And bless each wreath that blossoms o'er the dead; Revere each tree whose shelt'ring branches wave O'er the low mounds, the altars of the brave; Pause o'er each warrior's grass-grown bed, and hear In every breeze some name to glory dear; And as the shades of twilight close around, With martial pageants people all the ground. Thither unborn descendants of the slain Shall throng as pilgrims to the holy fane, While as they trace each spot, whose records tell Where fought their fathers, and prevail'd, and fell, Warm in their souls shall loftiest feelings glow, Claiming proud kindred with the dust below! And many an age shall see the brave repair, To learn the Hero's bright devotion there. And well, Ausonia! may that field of fame, From thee one song of echoing triumph claim. Land of the lyre! 'twas there th' avenging sword, Won the bright treasures to thy fanes restored; Those precious trophies o'er thy realms that throw A veil of radiance, hiding half thy woe, And bid the stranger for awhile forget How deep thy fall, and deem thee glorious yet. Yes, fair creations! to perfection wrought, Embodied visions of ascending thought! Forms of sublimity! by Genius traced In tints that vindicate adoring taste; Whose bright originals, to earth unknown, Live in the spheres encircling glory's throne; Models of art, to deathless fame consign'd, Stamp'd with the high-born majesty of mind; Yes, matchless works! your presence shall restore One beam of splendour to your native shore, And her sad scenes of lost renown illume, As the bright sunset gilds some hero's tomb. Oh! ne'er, in other climes, though many an eye Dwelt on your charms, in beaming ecstasy; Ne'er was it yours to bid the soul expand With thoughts so mighty, dreams so boldly grand, As in that realm, where each faint breeze's moan Seems a low dirge for glorious ages gone; Where 'midst the ruin'd shrines of many a vale, E'en Desolation tells a haughty tale, And scarce a fountain flows, a rock ascends, But its proud name with song eternal blends! Yes! in those scenes where every ancient stream Bids memory kindle o'er some lofty theme; Where every marble deeds of fame records, Each ruin tells of Earth's departed lords; And the deep tones of inspiration swell From each wild olive-wood, and Alpine dell; Where heroes slumber on their battle plains, Midst prostrate altars and deserted fanes, And Fancy communes, in each lonely spot, With shades of those who ne'er shall be forgot; There was your home, and there your power imprest, With tenfold awe, the pilgrim's glowing breast; And, as the wind's deep thrills and mystic sighs Wake the wild harp to loftiest harmonies, Thus at your influence, starting from repose, Thought, Feeling, Fancy, into grandeur rose. Fair Florence! queen of Arno's lovely vale! Justice and Truth indignant heard thy tale, And sternly smiled, in retribution's hour, To wrest thy treasures from the Spoiler's power. Too long the spirits of thy noble dead Mourn'd o'er the domes they rear'd in ages fled. Those classic scenes their pride so richly graced, Temples of genius, palaces of taste, Too long, with sad and desolated mien, Reveal'd where Conquest's lawless track had been; Reft of each form with brighter light imbued, Lonely they frown'd, a desert solitude. Florence! th' Oppressor's noon of pride is o'er, Rise in thy pomp again, and weep no more! As one, who, starting at the dawn of day From dark illusions, phantoms of dismay, With transport heighten'd by those ills of night, Hails the rich glories of expanding light; E'en thus, awak'ning from thy dream of woe, While heaven's own hues in radiance round thee glow, With warmer ecstasy 'tis thine to trace Each tint of beauty, and each line of grace; More bright, more prized, more precious, since deplored, As loved, lost relics, ne'er to be restored, Thy grief as hopeless as the tear-drop shed By fond affection bending o'er the dead. Athens of Italy! once more are thine Those matchless gems of Art's exhaustless mine. For thee bright Genius darts his living beam, Warm o'er thy shrines the tints of Glory stream, And forms august as natives of the sky, Rise round each fane in faultless majesty, So chastely perfect, so serenely grand, They seem creations of no mortal hand. Ye, at whose voice fair Art, with eagle glance, Burst in full splendour from her deathlike trance; Whose rallying call bade slumb'ring nations wake, And daring Intellect his bondage break; Beneath whose eye the lords of song arose, And snatch'd the Tuscan lyre from long repose, And bade its pealing energies resound, With power electric, through the realms around; Oh! high in thought, magnificent in soul! Born to inspire, enlighten, and control; Cosmo, Lorenzo! view your reign once more, The shrine where nations mingle to adore! Again th' Enthusiast there, with ardent gaze, Shall hail the mighty of departed days: Those sovereign spirits, whose commanding mind Seems in the marble's breathing mould enshrined; Still with ascendant power the world to awe, Still the deep homage of the heart to draw; To breathe some spell of holiness around, Bid all the scene be consecrated ground, And from the stone, by Inspiration wrought, Dart the pure lightnings of exalted thought. There thou, fair offspring of immortal Mind! Love's radiant goddess, idol of mankind! Once the bright object of Devotion's vow, Shalt claim from taste a kindred worship now. Oh! who can tell what beams of heavenly light, Flash'd o'er the sculptor's intellectual sight, How many a glimpse, reveal'd to him alone, Made brighter beings, nobler worlds, his own; Ere, like some vision sent the earth to bless, Burst into life thy pomp of loveliness! Young Genius there, while dwells his kindling eye On forms, instinct with bright divinity, While new-born powers, dilating in his heart, Embrace the full magnificence of Art; From scenes, by Raphael's gifted hand array'd, From dreams of heaven, by Angelo portray'd; From each fair work of Grecian skill sublime, Seal'd with perfection, “sanctified by time;” Shall catch a kindred glow, and proudly feel His spirit burn with emulative zeal, Buoyant with loftier hopes, his soul shall rise, Imbued at once with nobler energies; O'er life's dim scenes on rapid pinions soar, And worlds of visionary grace explore, Till his bold hand give glory's daydream birth, And with new wonders charm admiring earth. Venice, exult! and o'er thy moonlight seas, Swell with gay strains each Adriatic breeze! What though long fled those years of martial fame, That shed romantic lustre o'er thy name; Though to the winds thy streamers idly play, And the wild waves another Queen obey; Though quench'd the spirit of thine ancient race, And power and freedom scarce have left a trace; Yet still shall Art her splendours round thee cast, And gild the wreck of years for ever past. Again thy fanes may boast a Titian's dyes, Whose clear soft brilliance emulates thy skies, And scenes that glow in colouring's richest bloom, With life's warm flush Palladian halls illume. From thy rich dome again th' unrivall'd steed Starts to existence, rushes into speed, Still for Lysippus claims the wreath of fame, Panting with ardour, vivified with flame. Proud Racers of the Sun! to fancy's thought Burning with spirit, from his essence caught, No mortal birth ye seem—but form'd to bear Heaven's car of triumph through the realms of air; To range uncurb'd the pathless fields of space, The winds your rivals in the glorious race; Traverse empyreal spheres with buoyant feet, Free as the zephyr, as the shot-star fleet; And waft through worlds unknown the vital ray, The flame that wakes creations into day. Creatures of fire and ether! wing'd with light, To track the regions of the Infinite! From purer elements whose life was drawn, Sprung from the sunbeam, offspring of the dawn. What years on years, in silence gliding by, Have spared those forms of perfect symmetry! Moulded by Art to dignify, alone, Her own bright deity's resplendent throne, Since first her skill their fiery grace bestow'd, Meet for such lofty fate, such high abode, How many a race, whose tales of glory seem An echo's voice—the music of a dream, Whose records feebly from oblivion save A few bright traces of the wise and brave; How many a state, whose pillar'd strength sublime, Defied the storms of war, the waves of time, Towering o'er earth majestic and alone, Fortress of power—has flourish'd and is gone! And they, from clime to clime by conquest borne, Each fleeting triumph destined to adorn, They, that of powers and kingdoms lost and won, Have seen the noontide and the setting sun, Consummate still in every grace remain, As o'er their heads had ages roll'd in vain! Ages, victorious in their ceaseless flight, O'er countless monuments of earthly might! While she, from fair Byzantium's lost domain, Who bore those treasures to her ocean-reign, 'Midst the blue deep, who rear'd her island-throne, And called th' infinitude of waves her own; Venice, the proud, the Regent of the sea, Welcomes in chains the trophies of the Free! And thou, whose Eagle's towering plume unfurl'd, Once cast its shadow o'er a vassal world, Eternal city! round whose Curule throne, The lords of nations knelt in ages flown; Thou, whose Augustan years have left to time Immortal records of their glorious prime; When deathless bards, thine olive-shades among, Swell'd the high raptures of heroic song; Fair, fallen Empress! raise thy languid head From the cold altars of th' illustrious dead, And once again, with fond delight survey, The proud memorials of thy noblest day. Lo! where thy sons, oh Rome! a godlike train, In imaged majesty return again! Bards, chieftains, monarchs, tower with mien august O'er scenes that shrine their venerable dust. Those forms, those features, luminous with soul, Still o'er thy children seem to claim control; With awful grace arrest the pilgrim's glance, Bind his rapt soul in elevating trance, And bid the past, to fancy's ardent eyes, From time's dim sepulchre in glory rise. Souls of the lofty! whose undying names, Rouse the young bosom still to noblest aims; Oh! with your images could fate restore, Your own high spirit to your sons once more; Patriots and Heroes! could those flames return, That bade your hearts with freedom's ardours burn; Then from the sacred ashes of the first, Might a new Rome in phœnix grandeur burst! With one bright glance dispel th' horizon's gloom, With one loud call wake empire from the tomb; Bind round her brows her own triumphal crown, Lift her dread ægis with majestic frown, Unchain her eagle's wing, and guide his flight, To bathe his plumage in the fount of light. Vain dream! degraded Rome! thy noon is o'er, Once lost, thy spirit shall revive no more. It sleeps with those, the sons of other days, Who fix'd on thee the world's adoring gaze; Those, blest to live, while yet thy star was high, More blest, ere darkness quench'd its beam, to die! Yet, though thy faithless tutelary powers Have fled thy shrines, left desolate thy towers, Still, still to thee shall nations bend their way, Revered in ruin, sovereign in decay! Oh! what can realms, in fame's full zenith, boast, To match the relics of thy splendour lost! By Tiber's waves, on each illustrious hill, Genius and Taste shall love to wander still, For there has Art survived an empire's doom, And rear'd her throne o'er Latium's trophied tomb; She from the dust recalls the brave and free, Peopling each scene with beings worthy thee! Oh! ne'er again may War, with lightning-stroke, Rend its last honours from the shatter'd oak! Long be those works, revered by ages, thine, To lend one triumph to thy dim decline. Bright with stern beauty, breathing wrathful fire, In all the grandeur of celestial ire, Once more thine own, th' immortal Archer's form Sheds radiance round, with more than Being warm! Oh! who could view, nor deem that perfect frame, A living temple of ethereal flame? Lord of the daystar! how may words portray Of thy chaste glory one reflected ray? Whate'er the soul could dream, the hand could trace, Of regal dignity, and heavenly grace; Each purer effluence of the fair and bright, Whose fitful gleams have broke on mortal sight; Each bold idea, borrow'd from the sky, To vest th' embodied form of Deity; All, all in thee ennobled and refined, Breathe and enchant, transcendently combined! Son of Elysium! years and ages gone Have bow'd, in speechless homage, at thy throne, And days unborn, and nations yet to be, Shall gaze, absorb'd in ecstasy, on thee! And thou, triumphant wreck, e'en yet sublime, Disputed trophy, claimed by Art and Time; Hail to that scene again, where Genius caught From thee its fervours of diviner thought! Where He, th' inspired One, whose gigantic mind Lived in some sphere, to him alone assign'd; Who from the past, the future, and th' unseen, Could call up forms of more than earthly mien: Unrivall'd Angelo on thee would gaze, Till his full soul imbibed perfection's blaze! And who but he, that Prince of Art, might dare Thy sovereign greatness view without despair? Emblem of Rome! from power's meridian hurl'd, Yet claiming still the homage of the world. What hadst thou been, ere barb'rous hands defaced The work of wonder, idolized by taste? Oh! worthy still of some divine abode, Mould of a Conqueror! ruin of a God! Still, like some broken gem, whose quenchless beam From each bright fragment pours its vital stream, 'Tis thine, by fate unconquer'd, to dispense From every part some ray of excellence! E'en yet, inform'd with essence from on high, Thine is no trace of frail mortality! Within that frame a purer being glows, Through viewless veins a brighter current flows; Fill'd with immortal life each muscle swells, In every line supernal grandeur dwells. Consummate work! the noblest and the last Of Grecian Freedom, ere her reign was past: Nurse of the mighty, she, while ling'ring still, Her mantle flow'd o'er many a classic hill, Ere yet her voice its parting accents breathed, A hero's image to the world bequeathed; Enshrined in thee th' imperishable ray Of high-soul'd Genius, foster'd by her sway, And bade thee teach, to ages yet unborn, What lofty dreams were hers—who never shall return! And mark yon group, transfix'd with many a throe, Seal'd with the image of eternal woe: With fearful truth, terrific power, exprest, Thy pangs, Laocoon, agonize the breast, And the stern combat picture to mankind Of suffering nature, and enduring mind. Oh, mighty conflict! though his pains intense Distend each nerve, and dart through every sense; Though fix'd on him, his children's suppliant eyes Implore the aid avenging fate denies; Though with the giant-snake in fruitless strife, Heaves every muscle with convulsive life, And in each limb existence writhes, enroll'd 'Midst the dread circles of the venom'd fold; Yet the strong spirit lives—and not a cry Shall own the might of Nature's agony! That furrow'd brow unconquer'd soul reveals, That patient eye to angry Heaven appeals, That struggling bosom concentrates its breath, Nor yields one moan to torture or to death! Sublimest triumph of intrepid Art! With speechless horror to congeal the heart, To freeze each pulse, and dart through every vein, Cold thrills of fear, keen sympathies of pain; Yet teach the spirit how its lofty power May brave the pangs of fate's severest hour. Turn from such conflicts, and enraptured gaze On scenes where Painting all her skill displays: Landscapes, by colouring dress'd in richer dyes, More mellow'd sunshine, more unclouded skies, Or dreams of bliss, to dying martyrs given, Descending seraphs, robed in beams of heaven. Oh! sovereign Masters of the Pencil's might, Its depths of shadow, and its blaze of light; Ye, whose bold thought disdaining every bound, Explored the worlds above, below, around, Children of Italy! who stand alone And unapproach'd, 'midst regions all your own; What scenes, what beings bless'd your favour'd sight, Severely grand, unutterably bright! Triumphant spirits! your exulting eye Could meet the noontide of eternity, And gaze untired, undaunted, uncontroll'd, On all that Fancy trembles to behold. Bright on your view such forms their splendour shed, As burst on prophet-bards in ages fled: Forms that to trace, no hand but yours might dare, Darkly sublime, or exquisitely fair; These, o'er the walls your magic skill array'd, Glow in rich sunshine, gleam through melting shade, Float in light grace, in awful greatness tower, And breathe and move, the records of your power. Inspired of Heaven! what heighten'd pomp ye cast O'er all the deathless trophies of the past! Round many a marble fane and classic dome, Asserting still the majesty of Rome; Round many a work that bids the world believe What Grecian Art could image and achieve; Again, creative minds, your visions throw Life's chasten'd warmth, and Beauty's mellowest glow, And when the Morn's bright beams and mantling dyes, Pour the rich lustre of Ausonian skies, Or evening suns illume, with purple smile, The Parian altar, and the pillar'd aisle, Then, as the full, or soften'd radiance falls On angel-groups that hover o'er the walls, Well may those Temples, where your hand has shed Light o'er the tomb, existence round the dead, Seem like some world, so perfect and so fair, That nought of earth should find admittance there, Some sphere, where beings, to mankind unknown, Dwell in the brightness of their pomp alone! Hence, ye vain fictions! fancy's erring theme! Gods of illusion! phantoms of a dream! Frail, powerless idols of departed time, Fables of song, delusive, though sublime! To loftier tasks has Roman Art assign'd Her matchless pencil, and her mighty mind! From brighter streams her vast ideas flow'd, With purer fire her ardent spirit glow'd. To her 'twas given in fancy to explore The land of miracles, the holiest shore; That realm where first the light of life was sent, The loved, the punish'd, of th' Omnipotent! O'er Judah's hills her thoughts inspired would stray, Through Jordan's valleys trace their lonely way; By Siloa's brook, or Almotana's deep, Chain'd in dead silence, and unbroken sleep; Scenes, whose cleft rocks, and blasted deserts tell, Where pass'd th' Eternal, where his anger fell! Where oft his voice the words of fate reveal'd. Swell'd in the whirlwind, in the thunder peal'd, Or heard by prophets in some palmy vale, Breathed “still small” whispers on the midnight gale. There dwelt her spirit—there her hand portray'd, 'Midst the lone wilderness or cedar-shade, Ethereal forms with awful missions fraught, Or patriarch-seers absorb'd in sacred thought, Bards, in high converse with the world of rest, Saints of the earth, and spirits of the blest. But chief to Him, the Conqueror of the grave, Who lived to guide us, and who died to save; Him, at whose glance the powers of evil fled, And soul return'd to animate the dead; Whom the waves own'd—and sunk beneath his eye, Awed by one accent of Divinity; To Him she gave her meditative hours, Hallow'd her thoughts, and sanctified her powers. O'er her bright scenes sublime repose she threw, As all around the Godhead's presence knew, And robed the Holy One's benignant mien In beaming mercy, majesty serene. Oh! mark where Raphael's pure and perfect line Portrays that form ineffably divine! Where with transcendent skill his hand has shed Diffusive sunbeams round the Saviour's head; Each heaven-illumined lineament imbued With all the fulness of beatitude, And traced the sainted group, whose mortal sight Sinks overpower'd by that excess of light! Gaze on that scene, and own the might of Art, By truth inspired, to elevate the heart! To bid the soul exultingly possess, Of all her powers, a heighten'd consciousness; And strong in hope, anticipate the day, The last of life, the first of freedom's ray; To realize, in some unclouded sphere, Those pictured glories feebly imaged here! Dim, cold reflections from her native sky, Faint effluence of “the Day-spring from on high! MODERN GREECE. O Greece! thou sapient nurse of finer arts, Which to bright Science blooming Fancy bore, Be this thy praise, that thou, and thou alone, In these hast led the way, in these excell'd, Crown'd with the laurel of assenting Time. Thomson's Liberty. I O! who hath trod thy consecrated clime, Fair land of Phidias! theme of lofty strains! And traced each scene, that, 'midst the wrecks of time, The print of Glory's parting step retains; Nor for awhile, in high-wrought dreams, forgot, Musing on years gone by in brightness there, The hopes, the fears, the sorrows of his lot, The hues his fate hath worn, or yet may wear; As when, from mountain-heights, his ardent eye Of sea and heaven hath track'd the blue infinity? II Is there who views with cold unalter'd mien, His frozen heart with proud indifference fraught, Each sacred haunt, each unforgotten scene, Where Freedom triumph'd, or where Wisdom taught? Souls that too deeply feel, oh, envy not The sullen calm your fate hath never known: Through the dull twilight of that wint'ry lot Genius ne'er pierced, nor Fancy's sunbeam shone, Nor those high thoughts, that, hailing Glory's trace, Glow with the generous flames of every age and race, III But blest the wanderer, whose enthusiast mind Each muse of ancient days hath deep imbued With lofty lore; and all his thoughts refined In the calm school of silent solitude; Pour'd on his ear, 'midst groves and glens retired, The mighty strains of each illustrious clime, All that hath lived, while empires have expired, To float for ever on the winds of Time; And on his soul indelibly portray'd Fair visionary forms, to fill each classic shade. IV Is not his mind, to meaner thoughts unknown, A sanctuary of beauty and of light? There he may dwell in regions all his own, A world of dreams, where all is pure and bright. For him the scenes of old renown possess Romantic charms, all veil'd from other eyes; There every form of nature's loveliness Wakes in his breast a thousand sympathies; As music's voice, in some lone mountain-dell, From rocks and caves around calls forth each echo's swell. V For him Italia's brilliant skies illume The bard's lone haunts, the warrior's combat-plains, And the wild rose yet lives to breathe and bloom Round Doric Pæstum's solitary fanes. But most, fair Greece! on thy majestic shore He feels the fervours of his spirit rise; Thou birth-place of the Muse! whose voice of yore Breathed in thy groves immortal harmonies; And lingers still around the well-known coast, Murmuring a wild farewell to fame and freedom lost. VI By seas, that flow in brightness as they lave Thy rocks, th' enthusiast rapt in thought may stray, While roves his eye o'er that deserted wave, Once the proud scene of battle's dread array. —O ye blue waters! ye, of old that bore The free, the conquering, hymn'd by choral strains, How sleep ye now around the silent shore, The lonely realm of ruins and of chains! How are the mighty vanish'd in their pride! E'en as their barks have left no traces on your tide. VII Hush'd are the Pæans whose exulting tone Swell'd o'er that tide—the sons of battle sleep— The wind's wild sigh, the halcyon's voice alone Blend with the plaintive murmur of the deep. Yet when those waves have caught the splendid hues Of morn's rich firmament, serenely bright, Or setting suns the lovely shore suffuse With all their purple mellowness of light, O! who could view the scene, so calmly fair, Nor dream that peace, and joy, and liberty, were there? VIII Where soft the sunbeams play, the zephyrs blow, 'Tis hard to deem that misery can be nigh; Where the clear heavens in blue transparence glow, Life should be calm and cloudless as the sky; —Yet o'er the low, dark dwellings of the dead, Verdure and flowers in summer-bloom may smile, And ivy-boughs their graceful drapery spread In green luxuriance o'er the ruin'd pile; And mantling woodbine veil the wither'd tree,— And thus it is, fair land! forsaken Greece, with thee. IX For all the loveliness, and light, and bloom, That yet are thine, surviving many a storm, Are but as heaven's warm radiance on the tomb, The rose's blush that masks the canker-worm:— And thou art desolate—thy morn hath pass'd So dazzling in the splendour of its way, That the dark shades the night hath o'er thee cast. Throw tenfold gloom around thy deep decay. Once proud in freedom, still in ruin fair, Thy fate hath been unmatch'd—in glory and despair. X For thee, lost land! the hero's blood hath flow'd, The high in soul have brightly lived and died; For thee the light of soaring genius glow'd O'er the fair arts it form'd and glorified. Thine were the minds, whose energies sublime So distanced ages in their lightning-race, The task they left the sons of later time Was but to follow their illumined trace. —Now, bow'd to earth, thy children, to be free, Must break each link that binds their filial hearts to thee. XI Lo! to the scenes of fiction's wildest tales, Her own bright East, thy son, Morea! flies, To seek repose 'midst rich, romantic vales, Whose incense mounts to Asia's vivid skies. There shall he rest?—Alas! his hopes in vain Guide to the sun-clad regions of the palm, Peace dwells not now on oriental plain, Though earth is fruitfulness, and air is balm; And the sad wanderer finds but lawless foes, Where patriarchs reign'd of old, in pastoral repose. XII Where Syria's mountains rise, or Yemen's groves, Or Tigris rolls his genii-haunted wave, Life to his eye, as wearily it roves, Wears but two forms—the tyrant and the slave! There the fierce Arab leads his daring horde, Where sweeps the sand-storm o'er the burning wild; There stern Oppression waves the wasting sword O'er plains that smile, as ancient Eden smiled; And the vale's bosom, and the desert's gloom, Yield to the injured there no shelter save the tomb. XIII But thou, fair world! whose fresh unsullied charms Welcomed Columbus from the western wave, Wilt thou receive the wanderer to thine arms, The lost descendant of the immortal brave? Amidst the wild magnificence of shades That o'er thy floods their twilight-grandeur cast, In the green depth of thine untrodden glades Shall he not rear his bower of peace at last? Yes! thou hast many a lone, majestic scene, Shrined in primæval woods, where despot ne'er hath been. XIV There, by some lake, whose blue expansive breast Bright from afar, an inland-ocean, gleams, Girt with vast solitudes, profusely dress'd In tints like those that float o'er poet's dreams; Or where some flood from pine-clad mountain pours Its might of waters, glittering in their foam, 'Midst the rich verdure of its wooded shores, The exiled Greek hath fix'd his sylvan home: So deeply lone, that round the wild retreat Scarce have the paths been trod by Indian huntsman's feet. XV The forests are around him in their pride, The green savannas, and the mighty waves; And isles of flowers, bright-floating o'er the tide, That images the fairy worlds it laves, And stillness, and luxuriance—o'er his head The ancient cedars wave their peopled bowers, On high the palms their graceful foliage spread, Cinctured with roses the magnolia towers, And from those green arcades a thousand tones Wake with each breeze, whose voice through Nature's temple moans. XVI And there, no traces left by brighter days, For glory lost may wake a sigh of grief, Some grassy mound, perchance, may meet his gaze, The lone memorial of an Indian chief. There man not yet hath mark'd the boundless plain With marble records of his fame and power; The forest is his everlasting fane, The palm his monument, the rock his tower. Th' eternal torrent and the giant tree, Remind him but that they, like him, are wildly free. XVII But doth the exile's heart serenely there In sunshine dwell?—Ah! when was exile blest? When did bright scenes, clear heavens, or summer air, Chase from his soul the fever of unrest? —There is a heart-sick weariness of mood, That like slow poison wastes the vital glow, And shrines itself in mental solitude, An uncomplaining and a nameless woe, That coldly smiles 'midst pleasure's brightest ray, As the chill glacier's peak reflects the flush of day. XVIII Such grief is theirs, who, fix'd on foreign shore, Sigh for the spirit of their native gales, As pines the seaman, 'midst the ocean's roar, For the green earth, with all its woods and vales. Thus feels thy child, whose memory dwells with thee, Loved Greece! all sunk and blighted as thou art: Though thought and step in western wilds be free, Yet thine are still the daydreams of his heart: The deserts spread between, the billows foam, Thou, distant and in chains, are yet his spirit's home. XIX In vain for him the gay liannes entwine, Or the green fire-fly sparkles through the brakes, Or summer-winds waft odours from the pine, As eve's last blush is dying on the lakes. Through thy fair vales his fancy roves the while, Or breathes the freshness of Cithæron's height, Or dreams how softly Athens' towers would smile. Or Sunium's ruins, in the fading light; On Corinth's cliff what sunset hues may sleep, Or, at that placid hour, how calm th' Egean deep! XX What scenes, what sunbeams, are to him like thine? (The all of thine no tyrant could destroy!) E'en to the stranger's roving eye, they shine Soft as a vision of remember'd joy. And he who comes, the pilgrim of a day, A passing wanderer o'er each Attic hill, Sighs as his footsteps turn from thy decay, To laughing climes, where all is splendour still; And views with fond regret thy lessening shore, As he would watch a star that sets to rise no more. XXI Realm of sad beauty! thou art as a shrine That Fancy visits with Devotion's zeal, To catch high thoughts and impulses divine, And all the glow of soul enthusiasts feel Amidst the tombs of heroes—for the brave Whose dust, so many an age, hath been thy soil, Foremost in honour's phalanx, died to save The land redeem'd and hallow'd by their toil; And there is language in thy lightest gale, That o'er the plains they won seems murmuring yet their tale. XXII And he, whose heart is weary of the strife Of meaner spirits, and whose mental gaze Would shun the dull cold littleness of life, Awhile to dwell amidst sublimer days, Must turn to thee, whose every valley teems With proud remembrances that cannot die. Thy glens are peopled with inspiring dreams, Thy winds, the voice of oracles gone by; And, midst thy laurel shades the wanderer hears The sound of mighty names, the hymns of vanish'd years. XXIII Through that deep solitude be his to stray, By Faun and Oread loved in ages past, Where clear Peneus winds his rapid way Through the cleft heights, in antique grandeur vast. Romantic Tempe! thou art yet the same— Wild, as when sung by bards of elder time: Years, that have changed thy river's classic name, Have left thee still in savage pomp sublime; And from thine Alpine clefts, and marble caves, In living lustre still break forth the fountain waves. XXIV Beneath thy mountain battlements and towers, Where the rich arbute's coral-berries glow, Or, midst th' exuberance of thy forest bowers, Casting deep shadows o'er the current's flow, Oft shall the pilgrim pause, in lone recess, As rock and stream some glancing light have caught, And gaze, till Nature's mighty forms impress His soul with deep sublimity of thought; And linger oft, recalling many a tale, That breeze, and wave, and wood, seem whispering through thy dale. XXV He, thought-entranced, may wander where of old From Delphi's chasm the mystic vapour rose, And trembling nations heard their doom foretold By the dread spirit throned 'midst rocks and snows. Though its rich fanes be blended with the dust, And silence now the hallow'd haunt possess, Still is the scene of ancient rites august, Magnificent in mountain loneliness; Still Inspiration hovers o'er the ground, Where Greece her councils held, her Pythian victors crown'd. XXVI Or let his steps the rude grey cliffs explore Of that wild pass, once died with Spartan blood, When by the waves that break on Œta's shore, The few, the fearless, the devoted, stood! Or rove where, shadowing Mantinea's plain, Bloom the wild laurels o'er the warlike dead, Or lone Platæa's ruins yet remain, To mark the battle-field of ages fled; Still o'er such scenes presides a sacred power, Though Fiction's gods have fled from fountain, grot, and bower. XXVII Oh! still unblamed may fancy fondly deem, That, lingering yet, benignant genii dwell Where mortal worth has hallow'd grove or stream, To sway the heart with some ennobling spell; For mightiest minds have felt their blest control, In the wood's murmur, in the zephyr's sigh, And these are dreams that lend a voice and soul, And a high power, to Nature's majesty! And who can rove o'er Grecian shores, nor feel, Soft o'er his inmost heart, their secret magic steal? XXVIII Yet many a sad reality is there, That Fancy's bright illusions cannot veil. Pure laughs the light, and balmy breathes the air, But Slavery's mien will tell its bitter tale; And there, not Peace, but Desolation, throws Delusive quiet o'er full many a scene, Deep as the brooding torpor of repose That follows where the earthquake's track hath been; Or solemn calm, on Ocean's breast that lies, When sinks the storm, and death has hush'd the seaman's cries. XXIX Hast thou beheld some sovereign spirit, hurl'd By Fate's rude tempest from its radiant sphere, Doom'd to resign the homage of a world, For Pity's deepest sigh, and saddest tear? Oh! hast thou watch'd the awful wreck of mind, That weareth still a glory in decay? Seen all that dazzles and delights mankind— Thought, science, genius, to the storm a prey, And o'er the blasted tree, the wither'd ground, Despair's wild nightshade spread, and darkly flourish round? XXX So mayst thou gaze, in sad and awe-struck thought, On the deep fall of that yet lovely clime: Such there the ruin Time and Fate have wrought, So changed the bright, the splendid, the sublime; There the proud monuments of Valour's name, The mighty works Ambition piled on high, The rich remains by Art bequeath'd to Fame— Grace, beauty, grandeur, strength, and symmetry, Blend in decay; while all that yet is fair Seems only spared to tell how much hath perish'd there! XXXI There, while around lie mingling in the dust, The column's graceful shaft, with weeds o'ergrown, The mouldering torso, the forgotten bust, The warrior's urn, the altar's mossy stone; Amidst the loneliness of shatter'd fanes, Still matchless monuments of other years, O'er cypress groves, or solitary plains, Its eastern form the minaret proudly rears; As on some captive city's ruin'd wall The victor's banner waves, exulting o'er its fall. XXXII Still, where that column of the mosque aspires, Landmark of slavery, towering o'er the waste, There science droops, the Muses hush their lyres, And o'er the blooms of fancy and of taste Spreads the chill blight—as in that orient isle, Where the dark upas taints the gale around, Within its precincts not a flower may smile, Nor dew nor sunshine fertilize the ground; Nor wild birds' music float on zephyr's breath, But all is silence round, and solitude, and death. XXXIII Far other influence pour'd the Crescent's light O'er conquer'd realms, in ages pass'd away; Full and alone it beam'd, intensely bright, While distant climes in midnight darkness lay. Then rose th' Alhambra, with its founts and shades, Fair marble halls, alcoves, and orange bowers: Its sculptured lions, richly wrought arcades, Aerial pillars, and enchanted towers; Light, splendid, wild, as some Arabian tale Would picture fairy domes, that fleet before the gale. XXXIV Then foster'd genius lent each caliph's throne Lustre barbaric pomp could ne'er attain; And stars unnumber'd o'er the orient shone, Bright as that Pleïad, sphered in Mecca's fane. From Bagdat's palaces the choral strains Rose and re-echoed to the desert's bound, And Science, woo'd on Egypt's burning plains, Rear'd her majestic head with glory crown'd; And the wild Muses breathed romantic lore, From Syria's palmy groves to Andalusia's shore. XXXV Those years have past in radiance—they have past, As sinks the daystar in the tropic main; His parting beams no soft reflection cast, They burn—are quench'd—and deepest shadows reign. And Fame and Science have not left a trace In the vast regions of the Moslem's power,— Regions, to intellect a desert space, A wild without a fountain or a flower, Where towers Oppression 'midst the deepening glooms, As dark and lone ascends the cypress 'midst the tombs. XXXVI Alas for thee, fair Greece! when Asia pour'd Her fierce fanatics to Byzantium's wall, When Europe sheath'd, in apathy, her sword, And heard unmoved the fated city's call, No bold crusaders ranged their serried line Of spears and banners round a falling throne; And thou, O last and noblest Constantine! Didst meet the storm unshrinking and alone. Oh! blest to die in freedom, though in vain, Thine Empire's proud exchange the grave, and not the chain. XXXVII Hush'd is Byzantium—'tis the dead of night— The closing night of that imperial race! And all is vigil—but the eye of light Shall soon unfold, a wilder scene to trace: There is a murmuring stillness on the train, Thronging the midnight streets, at morn to die; And to the cross, in fair Sophia's fane, For the last time is raised Devotion's eye; And, in his heart while faith's bright visions rise, There kneels the high-soul'd prince, the summon'd of the skies. XXXVIII Day breaks in light and glory—'tis the hour Of conflict and of fate—the war-note calls— Despair hath lent a stern, delirious power To the brave few that guard the rampart walls. Far over Marmora's waves th' artillery's peal Proclaims an empire's doom in every note; Tambour and trumpet swell the clash of steel, Round spire and dome the clouds of battle float; From camp and wave rush on the crescent's host, And the Seven Towers are scaled, and all is won and lost. XXXIX Then, Greece! the tempest rose that burst on thee, Land of the bard, the warrior, and the sage! Oh! where were then thy sons, the great, the free, Whose deeds are guiding stars from age to age? Though firm thy battlements of crags and snows, And bright the memory of thy days of pride, In mountain might though Corinth's fortress rose, On, unresisted, roll'd th' invading tide! Oh! vain the rock, the rampart, and the tower, If Freedom guard them not with Mind's unconquer'd power. XL Where were th' avengers then, whose viewless might Preserved inviolate their awful fane, When through the steep defiles, to Delphi's height, In martial splendour pour'd the Persian's train? Then did those mighty and mysterious Powers, Arm'd with the elements, to vengeance wake, Call the dread storms to darken round their towers, Hurl down the rocks, and bid the thunders break; Till far around, with deep and fearful clang, Sounds of unearthly war through wild Parnassus rang. XLI Where was the spirit of the victor-throng Whose tombs are glorious by Scamander's tide, Whose names are bright in everlasting song, The lords of war, the praised, the deified? Where he, the hero of a thousand lays, Who from the dead at Marathon arose All arm'd; and beaming on the Athenians' gaze, A battle-meteor, guided to their foes? Or they whose forms to Alaric's awe-struck eye, Hovering o'er Athens, blazed, in airy panoply? XLII Ye slept, oh heroes! chief ones of the earth! High demigods of ancient days! ye slept. There lived no spark of your ascendant worth When o'er your land the victor Moslem swept; No patriot then the sons of freedom led, In mountain pass devotedly to die; The martyr-spirit of resolve was fled, And the high soul's unconquer'd buoyancy; And by your graves, and on your battle-plains, Warriors! your children knelt, to wear the stranger's chains. XLIII Now have your trophies vanish'd, and your homes Are moulder'd from the earth, while scarce remain E'en the faint traces of the ancient tombs That mark where sleep the slayers or the slain. Your deeds are with the days of glory flown, The lyres are hush'd that swell'd your fame afar, The halls that echo'd to their sounds are gone, Perish'd the conquering weapons of your war; And if a mossy stone your names retain, 'Tis but to tell your sons, for them ye died in vain. XLIV Yet, where some lone sepulchral relic stands, That with those names tradition hallows yet, Oft shall the wandering son of other lands Linger in solemn thought and hush'd regret. And still have legends mark'd the lonely spot Where low the dust of Agamemnon lies; And shades of kings and leaders unforgot, Hovering around, to fancy's vision rise. Souls of the heroes! seek your rest again, Nor mark how changed the realms that saw your glory's reign. XLV Lo, where th' Albanian spreads his despot sway O'er Thessaly's rich vales and glowing plains, Whose sons in sullen abjectness obey, Nor lift the hand indignant at its chains: Oh! doth the land that gave Achilles birth, And many a chief of old illustrious line, Yield not one spirit of unconquer'd worth To kindle those that now in bondage pine? No! on its mountain-air is slavery's breath, And terror chills the hearts whose utter'd plaints were death. XLVI Yet if thy light, fair Freedom, rested there, How rich in charms were that romantic clime, With streams, and woods, and pastoral valleys fair, And wall'd with mountains, haughtily sublime. Heights, that might well be deem'd the Muses' reign, Since, claiming proud alliance with the skies, They lose in loftier spheres their wild domain. Meet home for those retired divinities That love, where nought of earth may e'er intrude, Brightly to dwell on high, in lonely sanctitude. XLVII There, in rude grandeur, daringly ascends Stern Pindus, rearing many a pine-clad height; He with the clouds his bleak dominion blends, Frowning o'er vales, in woodland verdure bright. Wild and august in consecrated pride, There through the deep-blue heaven Olympus towers, Girdled with mists, light-floating as to hide The rock-built palace of immortal powers; Where far on high the sunbeam finds repose, Amidst th' eternal pomp of forests and of snows. XLVIII Those savage cliffs and solitudes might seem The chosen haunts where Freedom's foot would roam; She loves to dwell by glen and torrent-stream, And make the rocky fastnesses her home. And in the rushing of the mountain-flood, In the wild eagle's solitary cry, In sweeping winds that peal through cave and wood, There is a voice of stern sublimity, That swells her spirit to a loftier mood Of solemn joy severe, of power, of fortitude. XLIX But from those hills the radiance of her smile Hath vanish'd long, her step hath fled afar; O'er Suli's frowning rocks she paused a while, Kindling the watch-fires of the mountain war; And brightly glow'd her ardent spirit there, Still brightest 'midst privation: o'er distress It cast romantic splendour, and despair But fann'd that beacon of the wilderness; And rude ravine, and precipice, and dell, Sent their deep echoes forth, her rallying voice to swell. L Dark children of the hills! 'twas then ye wrought Deeds of fierce daring, rudely, sternly grand; As 'midst your craggy citadels ye fought, And women mingled with your warrior band. Then on the cliff the frantic mother stood High o'er the river's darkly-rolling wave, And hurl'd, in dread delirium, to the flood Her free-born infant, ne'er to be a slave. For all was lost—all, save the power to die The wild indignant death of savage liberty. LI Now is that strife a tale of vanish'd days, With mightier things forgotten soon to lie; Yet oft hath minstrel sung, in lofty lays, Deeds less adventurous, energies less high. And the dread struggle's fearful memory still O'er each wild rock a wilder aspect throws; Sheds darker shadows o'er the frowning hill, More solemn quiet o'er the glen's repose; Lends to the rustling pines a deeper moan, And the hoarse river's voice a murmur not its own. LII For stillness now—the stillness of the dead, Hath wrapt that conflict's lone and awful scene, And man's forsaken homes, in ruin spread, Tell where the storming of the cliffs hath been. And there, o'er wastes magnificently rude, What race may rove, unconscious of the chain? Those realms have now no desert unsubdued, Where Freedom's banner may be rear'd again: Sunk are the ancient dwellings of her fame, The children of her sons inherit but their name. LIII Go, seek proud Sparta's monuments and fanes! In scatter'd fragments o'er the vale they lie; Of all they were not e'en enough remains To lend their fall a mournful majesty. Birth-place of those whose names we first revered In song and story—temple of the free! O thou, the stern, the haughty, and the fear'd, Are such thy relics, and can this be thee? Thou shouldst have left a giant-wreck behind, And e'en in ruin claim'd the wonder of mankind. LIV For thine were spirits cast in other mould Than all beside—and proved by ruder test; They stood alone—the proud, the firm, the bold, With the same seal indelibly imprest. Theirs were no bright varieties of mind, One image stamp'd the rough, colossal race, In rugged grandeur frowning o'er mankind, Stern, and disdainful of each milder grace. As to the sky some mighty rock may tower, Whose front can brave the storm, but will not rear the flower. LV Such were thy sons—their life a battle day! Their youth one lesson how for thee to die! Closed is that task, and they have pass'd away Like softer beings train'd to aims less high. Yet bright on earth their fame who proudly fell, True to their shields, the champions of thy cause, Whose funeral column bade the stranger tell How died the brave, obedient to thy laws! O lofty mother of heroic worth, How couldst thou live to bring a meaner offspring forth? LVI Hadst thou but perish'd with the free, nor known A second race, when Glory's noon went by, Then had thy name in single brightness shone A watchword on the helm of liberty! Thou shouldst have pass'd with all the light of fame, And proudly sunk in ruins, not in chains. But slowly set thy star 'midst clouds of shame, And tyrants rose amidst thy falling fanes; And thou, surrounded by thy warriors' graves, Hast drain'd the bitter cup once mingled for thy slaves. LVII Now all is o'er—for thee alike are flown Freedom's bright noon, and Slavery's twilight cloud; And in thy fall, as in thy pride, alone, Deep solitude is round thee, as a shroud. Home of Leonidas! thy halls are low, From their cold altars have thy Lares fled, O'er thee unmark'd the sunbeams fade or glow, And wild-flowers wave, unbent by human tread; And 'midst thy silence, as the grave's profound, A voice, a step, would seem as some unearthly sound. LVIII Taÿgetus still lifts his awful brow, High o'er the mouldering city of the dead, Sternly sublime; while o'er his robe of snow Heaven's floating tints their warm suffusions spread. And yet his rippling wave Eurotas leads By tombs and ruins o'er the silent plain, While whisp'ring there, his own wild graceful reeds Rise as of old, when hail'd by classic strain; There the rose laurels still in beauty wave, And a frail shrub survives to bloom o'er Sparta's grave. LIX Oh! thus it is with man—a tree, a flower, While nations perish, still renews its race, And o'er the fallen records of his power Spreads in wild pomp, or smiles in fairy grace. The laurel shoots when those have pass'd away Once rivals for its crown, the brave, the free; The rose is flourishing o'er beauty's clay, The myrtle blows when love hath ceased to be; Green waves the bay when song and bard are fled, And all that round us blooms, is blooming o'er the dead. LX And still the olive spreads its foliage round Morea's fallen sanctuaries and towers, Once its green boughs Minerva's votaries crown'd, Deem'd a meet offering for celestial powers. The suppliant's hand its holy branches bore; They waved around the Olympic victor's head; And, sanctified by many a rite of yore, Its leaves the Spartan's honour'd bier o'erspread: Those rites have vanish'd—but o'er vale and hill Its fruitful groves arise, revered and hallow'd still. LXI Where now thy shrines, Eleusis! where thy fane Of fearful visions, mysteries wild and high? The pomp of rites, the sacrificial train, The long procession's awful pageantry? Quench'd is the torch of Ceres—all around Decay hath spread the stillness of her reign, There never more shall choral hymns resound, O'er the hush'd earth and solitary main; Whose wave from Salamis deserted flows, To bathe a silent shore of desolate repose. LXII And oh! ye secret and terrific powers, Dark oracles! in depth of groves that dwelt, How are they sunk, the altars of your bowers, Where Superstition trembled as she knelt! Ye, the unknown, the viewless ones! that made The elements your voice, the wind and wave; Spirits! whose influence darken'd many a shade, Mysterious visitants of fount and cave! How long your power the awe-struck nations sway'd, How long earth dreamt of you, and shudderingly obey'd! LXIII And say, what marvel, in those early days, While yet the light of heaven-born truth was not; If man around him cast a fearful gaze, Peopling with shadowy powers each dell and grot? Awful is nature in her savage forms, Her solemn voice commanding in its might, And mystery then was in the rush of storms, The gloom of woods, the majesty of night; And mortals heard Fate's language in the blast, And rear'd your forest-shrines, ye phantoms of the past! LXIV Then through the foliage not a breeze might sigh But with prophetic sound—a waving tree, A meteor flashing o'er the summer sky, A bird's wild flight reveal'd the things to be. All spoke of unseen natures, and convey'd Their inspiration; still they hover'd round, Hallow'd the temple, whisper'd through the shade, Pervaded loneliness, gave soul to sound; Of them the fount, the forest, murmur'd still, Their voice was in the stream, their footstep on the hill. LXV Now is the train of Superstition flown, Unearthly Beings walk on earth no more; The deep wind swells with no portentous tone, The rustling wood breathes no fatidic lore. Fled are the phantoms of Livadia's cave, There dwell no shadows, but of crag and steep; Fount of Oblivion! in thy gushing wave, That murmurs nigh, those powers of terror sleep. Oh! that such dreams alone had fled that clime, But Greece is changed in all that could be changed by time! LXVI Her skies are those whence many a mighty bard Caught inspiration, glorious as their beams; Her hills the same that heroes died to guard, Her vales, that foster'd Art's divinest dreams! But that bright spirit o'er the land that shone, And all around pervading influence pour'd, That lent the harp of Æschylus its tone, And proudly hallow'd Lacedæmon's sword, And guided Phidias o'er the yielding stone, With them its ardours lived—with them its light is flown. LXVII Thebes, Corinth, Argos!—ye, renown'd of old, Where are your chiefs of high romantic name? How soon the tale of ages may be told! A page, a verse, records the fall of fame, The work of centuries—we gaze on you, Oh cities! once the glorious and the free, The lofty tales that charm'd our youth renew, And wondering ask, if these their scenes could be? Search for the classic fane, the regal tomb, And find the mosque alone—a record of their doom! LXVIII How oft hath war his host of spoilers pour'd, Fair Elis! o'er thy consecrated vales? There have the sunbeams glanced on spear and sword, And banners floated on the balmy gales. Once didst thou smile, secure in sanctitude, As some enchanted isle 'mid stormy seas; On thee no hostile footstep might intrude, And pastoral sounds alone were on thy breeze. Forsaken home of peace! that spell is broke, Thou too hast heard the storm, and bow'd beneath the yoke. LXIX And through Arcadia's wild and lone retreats Far other sounds have echo'd than the strain Of faun and dryad, from their woodland seats, Or ancient reed of peaceful mountain-swain! There, though at times Alpheus yet surveys, On his green banks renew'd, the classic dance, And nymph-like forms, and wild melodious lays, Revive the silvan scenes of old romance; Yet brooding fear and dark suspicion dwell 'Midst Pan's deserted haunts, by fountain, cave, and dell. LXX But thou, fair Attica! whose rocky bound All art and nature's richest gifts enshrined, Thou little sphere, whose soul-illumined round Concentrated each sunbeam of the mind; Who, as the summit of some Alpine height Glows earliest, latest, with the blush of day, Didst first imbibe the splendours of the light, And smile the longest in its lingering ray; Oh! let us gaze on thee, and fondly deem The past awhile restored, the present but a dream. LXXI Let Fancy's vivid hues awhile prevail— Wake at her call—be all thou wert once more! Hark—hymns of triumph swell on every gale! Lo—bright processions move along thy shore! Again thy temples, 'midst the olive-shade, Lovely in chaste simplicity arise; And graceful monuments, in grove and glade, Catch the warm tints of thy resplendent skies; And sculptured forms, of high and heavenly mien, In their calm beauty smile, around the sun-bright scene. LXXII Again renew'd by Thought's creative spells, In all her pomp thy city, Theseus! towers: Within, around, the light of glory dwells On art's fair fabrics, wisdom's holy bowers. There marble fanes in finish'd grace ascend, The pencil's world of life and beauty glows; Shrines, pillars, porticoes, in grandeur blend, Rich with the trophies of barbaric foes; And groves of platane wave, in verdant pride, The sage's blest retreats, by calm Ilissus' tide. LXXIII Bright as that fairy vision of the wave, Raised by the magic of Morgana's wand, On summer seas, that undulating lave Romantic Sicily's Arcadian strand; That pictured scene of airy colonnades, Light palaces, in shadowy glory drest, Enchanted groves, and temples, and arcades, Gleaming and floating on the ocean's breast; Athens! thus fair the dream of thee appears, As Fancy's eye pervades the veiling cloud of years LXXIV Still be that cloud withdrawn—oh! mark on high, Crowning yon hill, with temples richly graced, That fane, august in perfect symmetry, The purest model of Athenian taste. Fair Parthenon! thy Doric pillars rise In simple dignity, thy marble's hue Unsullied shincs, relieved by brilliant skies, That round thee spread their deep ethereal blue; And art o'er all thy light proportions throws The harmony of grace, the beauty of repose. LXXV And lovely o'er thee sleeps the sunny glow, When morn and eve in tranquil splendour reign, And on thy sculptures, as they smile, bestow Hues that the pencil emulates in vain. Then the fair forms by Phidias wrought, unfold Each latent grace, developing in light, Catch from soft clouds of purple and of gold, Each tint that passes, tremulously bright; And seem indeed whate'er devotion deems, While so suffused with heaven, so mingling with its beams. LXXVI But oh! what words the vision may portray, The form of sanctitude that guards thy shrine? There stands thy goddess, robed in war's array, Supremely glorious, awfully divine! With spear and helm she stands, and flowing vest, And sculptured ægis, to perfection wrought, And on each heavenly lineament imprest, Calmly sublime, the majesty of thought; The pure intelligence, the chaste repose,— All that a poet's dream around Minerva throws. LXXVII Bright age of Pericles! let fancy still Through time's deep shadows all thy splendour trace, And in each work of art's consummate skill Hail the free spirit of thy lofty race. That spirit, roused by every proud reward That hope could picture, glory could bestow, Foster'd by all the sculptor and the bard Could give of immortality below. Thus were thy heroes form'd, and o'er their name Thus did thy genius shed imperishable fame. LXXVIII Mark in the throng'd Ceramicus, the train Of mourners weeping o'er the martyr'd brave: Proud be the tears devoted to the slain, Holy the amaranth strew'd upon their grave! And hark—unrivall'd eloquence proclaims Their deeds, their trophies, with triumphant voice! Hark—Pericles records their honour'd names! Sons of the fallen, in their lot rejoice: What hath life brighter than so bright a doom? What power hath fate to soil the garlands of the tomb? LXXIX Praise to the valiant dead! for them doth art Exhaust her skill, their triumphs bodying forth; Theirs are enshrined names, and every heart Shall bear the blazon'd impress of their worth. Bright on the dreams of youth their fame shall rise, Their fields of fight shall epic song record; And, when the voice of battle rends the skies, Their name shall be their country's rallying word! While fane and column rise august to tell How Athens honours those for her who proudly fell. LXXX City of Theseus! bursting on the mind, Thus dost thou rise, in all thy glory fled! Thus guarded by the mighty of mankind, Thus hallow'd by the memory of the dead: Alone in beauty and renown—a scene Whose tints are drawn from freedom's loveliest ray. 'Tis but a vision now—yet thou hast been More than the brightest vision might portray; And every stone, with but a vestige fraught Of thee, hath latent power to wake some lofty thought. LXXXI Fall'n are thy fabrics, that so oft have rung To choral melodies, and tragic lore; Now is the lyre of Sophocles unstrung, The song that hail'd Harmodius peals no more. Thy proud Piræus is a desert strand, Thy stately shrines are mould'ring on their hill, Closed are the triumphs of the sculptor's hand, The magic voice of eloquence is still; Minerva's veil is rent—her image gone, Silent the sage's bower—the warrior's tomb o'er-thrown. LXXXII Yet in decay thine exquisite remains Wond'ring we view, and silently revere, As traces left on earth's forsaken plains By vanish'd beings of a nobler sphere! Not all the old magnificence of Rome, All that dominion there hath left to time; Proud Coliseum, or commanding dome, Triumphal arch, or obelisk sublime, Can bid such reverence o'er the spirit steal, As aught by thee imprest with beauty's plastic seal. LXXXIII Though still the empress of the sunburnt waste, Palmyra rises, desolately grand— Though with rich gold and massy sculpture graced, Commanding still, Persepolis may stand In haughty solitude—though sacred Nile The first-born temples of the world surveys, And many an awful and stupendous pile Thebes of the hundred gates e'en yet displays; City of Pericles! O who, like thee, Can teach how fair the works of mortal hand may be? LXXXIV Thou ledd'st the way to that illumined sphere Where sovereign beauty dwells; and thence didst bear, Oh, still triumphant in that high career! Bright archetypes of all the grand and fair. And still to thee th' enlighten'd mind hath flown As to her country;—thou hast been to earth A cynosure;—and, e'en from victory's throne, Imperial Rome gave homage to thy worth; And nations, rising to their fame afar, Still to thy model turn, as seamen to their star. LXXXV Glory to those whose relics thus arrest The gaze of ages! Glory to the free! For they, they only, could have thus imprest Their mighty image on the years to be! Empires and cities in oblivion lie, Grandeur may vanish, conquest be forgot:— To leave on earth renown that cannot die, Of high-soul'd genius is th' unrivall'd lot. Honour to thee, O Athens! thou hast shown What mortals may attain, and seized the palm alone. LXXXVI Oh! live there those who view with scornful eyes All that attests the brightness of thy prime? Yes; they who dwell beneath thy lovely skies, And breathe th' inspiring ether of thy clime! Their path is o'er the mightiest of the dead, Their homes are 'midst the works of noblest arts; Yet all around their gaze, beneath their tread, Not one proud thrill of loftier thought imparts. Such are the conquerors of Minerva's land, Where Genius first reveal'd the triumphs of his hand! LXXXVII For them in vain the glowing light may smile O'er the pale marble, colouring's warmth to shed, And in chaste beauty many a sculptured pile Still o'er the dust of heroes lift its head. No patriot feeling binds them to the soil, Whose tombs and shrines their fathers have not rear'd, Their glance is cold indifference, and their toil But to destroy what ages have revered, As if exulting sternly to erase Whate'er might prove that land had nursed a nobler race. LXXXVIII And who may grieve that, rescued from their hands, Spoilers of excellence and foes to art, Thy relics, Athens! borne to other lands, Claim homage still to thee from every heart? Though now no more th' exploring stranger's sight, Fix'd in deep reverence on Minerva's fane, Shall hail, beneath their native heaven of light, All that remain'd of forms adored in vain; A few short years—and, vanish'd from the scene, To blend with classic dust their proudest lot had been. LXXXIX Fair Parthenon! yet still must Fancy weep For thee, thou work of nobler spirits flown. Bright, as of old, the sunbeams o'er thee sleep In all their beauty still—and thine is gone! Empires have sunk since thou wert first revered, And varying rites have sanctified thy shrine. The dust is round thee of the race that rear'd Thy walls; and thou—their fate must soon be thine! But when shall earth again exult to see Visions divine like theirs renew'd in aught like thee? XC Lone are thy pillars now—each passing gale Sighs o'er them as a spirit's voice, which moan'd That loneliness, and told the plaintive tale Of the bright synod once above them throned. Mourn, graceful ruin! on thy sacred hill, Thy gods, thy rites, a kindred fate have shared: Yet art thou honour'd in each fragment still That wasting years and barbarous hands had spared; Each hallow'd stone, from rapine's fury borne, Shall wake bright dreams of thee in ages yet unborn. XCI Yes; in those fragments, though by time defaced And rude insensate conquerors, yet remains All that may charm th' enlighten'd eye of taste, On shores where still inspiring freedom reigns. As vital fragrance breathes from every part Of the crush'd myrtle, or the bruised rose, E'en thus th' essential energy of art There in each wreck imperishably glows! The soul of Athens lives in every line, Pervading brightly still the ruins of her shrine. XCII Mark—on the storied frieze the graceful train, The holy festival's triumphal throng, In fair procession, to Minerva's fane, With many a sacred symbol, move along. There every shade of bright existence trace, The fire of youth, the dignity of age; The matron's calm austerity of grace, The ardent warrior, the benignant sage; The nymph's light symmetry, the chief's proud mien; Each ray of beauty caught and mingled in the scene. XCIII Art unobtrusive there ennobles form, Each pure chaste outline exquisitely flows; There e'en the steed, with bold expression warm, Is clothed with majesty, with being glows. One mighty mind hath harmonized the whole; Those varied groups the same bright impress bear; One beam and essence of exalting soul Lives in the grand, the delicate, the fair; And well that pageant of the glorious dead Blends us with nobler days, and loftier spirits fled. XCIV O, conquering Genius! that couldst thus detain The subtle graces, fading as they rise, Eternalize expression's fleeting reign, Arrest warm life in all its energies, And fix them on the stone—thy glorious lot Might wake ambition's envy, and create Powers half divine: while nations are forgot, A thought, a dream of thine hath vanquish'd fate! And when thy hand first gave its wonders birth, The realms that hail them now scarce claim'd a name on earth. XCV Wert thou some spirit of a purer sphere But once beheld, and never to return? No—we may hail again thy bright career, Again on earth a kindred fire shall burn! Though thy least relics, e'en in ruin, bear A stamp of heaven, that ne'er hath been renew'd— A light inherent—let not man despair: Still be hope ardent, patience unsubdued; For still is nature fair, and thought divine, And art hath won a world in models pure as thine. XCVI Gaze on yon forms, corroded and defaced— Yet there the germ of future glory lies! Their virtual grandeur could not be erased; It clothes them still, though veil'd from common eyes. They once were gods and heroes—and beheld As the blest guardians of their native scene; And hearts of warriors, sages, bards, have swell'd With awe that own'd their sovereignty of mien. —Ages have vanish'd since those hearts were cold, And still those shatter'd forms retain their godlike mould. XCVII 'Midst their bright kindred, from their marble throne They have look'd down on thousand storms of time; Surviving power, and fame, and freedom flown, They still remain'd, still tranquilly sublime! Till mortal hands the heavenly conclave marr'd. Th'Olympian groups have sunk, and are forgot; Not e'en their dust could weeping Athens guard— But these were destined to a nobler lot! And they have borne, to light another land, The quenchless ray that soon shall gloriously expand. XCVIII Phidias! supreme in thought! what hand but thine, In human works thus blending earth and heaven, O'er nature's truth hath shed that grace divine, To mortal form immortal grandeur given? What soul but thine, infusing all its power, In these last monuments of matchless days, Could, from their ruins, bid young Genius tower, And Hope aspire to more exalted praise? And guide deep Thought to that secluded height Where Excellence is throned, in purity of light. XCIX And who can tell how pure, how bright a flame, Caught from these models, may illume the west? What British Angelo may rise to fame, On the free isle what beams of art may rest? Deem not, O England! that by climes confined, Genius and taste diffuse a partial ray; Deem not th' eternal energies of mind Sway'd by that sun whose doom is but decay! Shall thought be foster'd but by skies serene? No! thou hast power to be what Athens e'er hath been. C But thine are treasures oft unprized, unknown, And cold neglect hath blighted many a mind, O'er whose young ardours had thy smile but shone, Their soaring flight had left a world behind! And many a gifted hand, that might have wrought To Grecian excellence the breathing stone, Or each pure grace of Raphael's pencil caught, Leaving no record of its power, is gone! While thou hast fondly sought, on distant coast, Gems far less rich than those, thus precious, and thus lost. CI Yet rise, O Land, in all but art alone, Bid the sole wreath that is not thine be won! Fame dwells around thee—Genius is thine own; Call his rich blooms to life—be thou their sun! So, should dark ages o'er thy glory sweep, Should thine e'er be as now are Grecian plains, Nations unborn shall track thine own blue deep, To hail thy shore, to worship thy remains; Thy mighty monuments with reverence trace, And cry, “This ancient soil hath nursed a glorious race!” MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. LINES WRITTEN IN A HERMITAGE ON THE SEASHORE. O wanderer! would thy heart forget Each earthly passion and regret, And would thy wearied spirit rise To commune with its native skies; Pause for a while, and deem it sweet To linger in this calm retreat; And give thy cares, thy griefs, a short suspense, Amidst wild scenes of lone magnificence. Unmix'd with aught of meaner tone, Here nature's voice is heard alone: When the loud storm, in wrathful hour, Is rushing on its wing of power, And spirits of the deep awake, And surges foam, and billows break, And rocks and ocean-caves around, Reverberate each awful sound; That mighty voice, with all its dread control, To loftiest thought shall wake thy thrilling soul. But when no more the sea-winds rave, When peace is brooding on the wave, And from earth, air, and ocean rise No sounds but plaintive melodies; Sooth'd by their softly mingling swell, As daylight bids the world farewell, The rustling wood, the dying breeze, The faint, low rippling of the seas, A tender calm shall steal upon thy breast, A gleam reflected from the realms of rest. Is thine a heart the world hath stung, Friends have deceived, neglect hath wrung? Hast thou some grief that none may know, Some lonely, secret, silent woe? Or have thy fond affections fled From earth, to slumber with the dead?— Oh! pause awhile—the world disown, And dwell with nature's self alone! And though no more she bids arise Thy soul's departed energies, And though thy joy of life is o'er, Beyond her magic to restore; Yet shall her spells o'er every passion steal, And soothe the wounded heart they cannot heal. DIRGE OF A CHILD. No bitter tears for thee be shed, Blossom of being! seen and gone! With flowers alone we strew thy bed, O blest departed One! Whose all of life, a rosy ray, Blush'd into dawn and pass'd away. Yes! thou art fled, ere guilt had power To stain thy cherub-soul and form, Closed is the soft ephemeral flower That never felt a storm! The sunbeam's smile, the zephyr's breath, All that it knew from birth to death. Thou wert so like a form of light, That heaven benignly call'd thee hence, Ere yet the world could breathe one blight O'er thy sweet innocence: And thou, that brighter home to bless, Art pass'd, with all thy loveliness! Oh! hadst thou still on earth remain'd, Vision of beauty! fair, as brief! How soon thy brightness had been stain'd With passion or with grief! Now not a sullying breath can rise, To dim thy glory in the skies. We rear no marble o'er thy tomb; No sculptured image there shall mourn; Ah! fitter far the vernal bloom Such dwelling to adorn. Fragrance, and flowers, and dews, must be The only emblems meet for thee. Thy grave shall be a blessed shrine, Adorn'd with Nature's brightest wreath; Each glowing season shall combine Its incense there to breathe; And oft, upon the midnight air, Shall viewless harps be murmuring there. And oh! sometimes in visions blest, Sweet spirit! visit our repose; And bear, from thine own world of rest, Some balm for human woes! What form more lovely could be given Than thine to messenger of heaven? Vide Annotation from Quarterly Review, page 287. INVOCATION. Hush'd is the world in night and sleep, Earth, Sea, and Air, are still as death; Too rude to break a calm so deep, Were music's faintest breath. Descend, bright Visions! from aërial bowers, Descend to gild your own soft, silent hours. In hope or fear, in toil or pain, The weary day have mortals past; Now, dreams of bliss! be yours to reign, And all your spells around them cast; Steal from their hearts the pang, their eyes the tear, And lift the veil that hides a brighter sphere. O! bear your softest balm to those, Who fondly, vainly, mourn the dead, To them that world of peace disclose, Where the bright soul is fled: Where Love, immortal in his native clime, Shall fear no pang from fate, no blight from time. Or to his loved, his distant land, On your light wings the exile bear To feel once more his heart expand, In his own genial mountain-air; Hear the wild echoes' well-known strains repeat, And bless each note, as Heaven's own music sweet. But oh! with Fancy's brightest ray, Blest dreams! the bard's repose illume; Bid forms of heaven around him play, And bowers of Eden bloom! And waft his spirit to its native skies Who finds no charm in life's realities. No voice is on the air of night, Through folded leaves no murmurs creep, Nor star nor moonbeam's trembling light Falls on the placid brow of sleep. Descend, bright visions! from your airy bower: Dark, silent, solemn, is your favourite hour. TO THE MEMORY OF GENERAL SIR E?D P?K?M. Brave spirit! mourn'd with fond regret, Lost in life's pride, in valour's noon, Oh! who could deem thy star should set So darkly and so soon! Fatal, though bright, the fire of mind Which mark'd and closed thy brief career, And the fair wreath, by Hope entwined, Lies wither'd on thy bier. The soldier's death hath been thy doom, The soldier's tear thy meed shall be; Yet, son of war! a prouder tomb Might Fate have rear'd for thee. Thou shouldst have died, O high-soul'd chief! In those bright days of glory fled, When triumph so prevail'd o'er grief, We scarce could mourn the dead. Noontide of fame! each tear-drop then Was worthy of a warrior's grave: When shall affection weep again So proudly o'er the brave? There, on the battle-fields of Spain, 'Midst Roncesvalles' mountain-scene, Or on Vittoria's blood-red plain, Meet had thy deathbed been. We mourn not that a hero's life Thus in its ardent prime should close; Hadst thou but fallen in nobler strife, But died 'midst conquer'd foes! Yet hast thou still (though victory's flame In that last moment cheer'd thee not) Left Glory's isle another name, That ne'er may be forgot: And many a tale of triumph won, Shall breathe that name in Memory's ear, And long may England mourn a son Without reproach or fear. TO THE MEMORY OF SIR H?Y E?LL?S. WHO FELL IN THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO. Happy are they who die in youth when their renown is around them.”—Ossian. Weep'st thou for him, whose doom was seal'd On England's proudest battle-field? For him, the lion-heart, who died In victory's full resistless tide? Oh, mourn him not! By deeds like his that field was won, And Fate could yield to Valour's son No brighter lot. He heard his band's exulting cry, He saw the vanquish'd eagles fly; And envied be his death of fame, It shed a sunbeam o'er his name That nought shall dim: No cloud obscured his glory's day, It saw no twilight of decay— Weep not for him! And breathe no dirge's plaintive moan, A hero claims far loftier tone! Oh! proudly should the war-song swell, Recording how the mighty fell In that dread hour, When England, 'midst the battle-storm— Th' avenging angel—rear'd her form In tenfold power. Yet, gallant heart! to swell thy praise, Vain were the minstrel's noblest lays; Since he, the soldier's guiding-star, The Victor-chief, the lord of war, Has own'd thy fame: And oh! like his approving word, What trophied marble could record A warrior's name? GUERILLA SONG. FOUNDED ON THE STORY RELATED OF THE SPANISH PATRIOT MINA. Oh! forget not the hour, when through forest and vale, We return'd with our chief to his dear native halls; Through the woody Sierra there sigh'd not a gale, And the moonbeam was bright on his battlement-walls; And nature lay sleeping in calmness and light, Round the home of the valiant, that rose on our sight. We enter'd that home—all was loneliness round, The stillness, the darkness, the peace of the grave; Not a voice, not a step, bade its echoes resound, Ah! such was the welcome that waited the brave! For the spoilers had pass'd, like the poison-wind's breath, And the loved of his bosom lay silent in death. Oh! forget not that hour—let its image be near, In the light of our mirth, in the dreams of our rest, Let its tale awake feelings too deep for a tear, And rouse into vengeance each arm and each breast, Till cloudless the dayspring of liberty shine O'er the plains of the olive, and hills of the vine. THE AGED INDIAN. Warriors! my noon of life is past, The brightness of my spirit flown; I crouch before the wintry blast, Amidst my tribe I dwell alone; The heroes of my youth are fled, They rest among the warlike dead. Ye slumberers of the narrow cave! My kindred-chiefs in days of yore Ye fill an unremember'd grave, Your fame, your deeds, are known no more. The records of your wars are gone, Your names forgot by all but one. Soon shall that one depart from earth, To join the brethren of his prime; Then will the memory of your birth Sleep with the hidden things of time. With him, ye sons of former days! Fades the last glimmering of your praise. His eyes, that hail'd your spirits' flame, Still kindling in the combat's shock, Have seen, since darkness veil'd your fame, Sons of the desert and the rock! Another, and another race, Rise to the battle and the chase. Descendants of the mighty dead! Fearless of heart, and firm of hand! O! let me join their spirits fled, O! send me to their shadowy land. Age hath not tamed Ontara's heart, He shrinks not from the friendly dart. These feet no more can chase the deer, The glory of this arm is flown;— Why should the feeble linger here, When all the pride of life is gone? Warriors! why still the stroke deny, Think ye Ontara fears to die? He fear'd not in his flower of days, When strong to stem the torrent's force, When through the desert's pathless maze, His way was as an eagle's course! When war was sunshine to his sight, And the wild hurricane, delight! Shall then the warrior tremble now? Now when his envied strength is o'er? Hung on the pine his idle bow, His pirogue useless on the shore? When age hath dimm'd his failing eye, Shall he, the joyless, fear to die? Sons of the brave! delay no more, The spirits of my kindred call; 'Tis but one pang, and all is o'er! Oh! bid the aged cedar fall! To join the brethren of his prime, The mighty of departed time. EVENING AMONGST THE ALPS. Soft skies of Italy! how richly drest, Smile these wild scenes in your purpureal glow! What glorious hues, reflected from the west, Float o'er the dwellings of eternal snow! Yon torrent, foaming down the granite steep, Sparkles all brilliance in the setting beam; Dark glens beneath in shadowy beauty sleep, Where pipes the goatherd by his mountain-stream. Now from yon peak departs the vivid ray, That still at eve its lofty temple knows; From rock and torrent fade the tints away, And all is wrapt in twilight's deep repose: While through the pine-wood gleams the vesper star, And roves the Alpine gale o'er solitudes afar. DIRGE OF THE HIGHLAND CHIEF IN “WAVERLEY.” Son of the mighty and the free! High-minded leader of the brave! Was it for lofty chief like thee, To fill a nameless grave? Oh! if amidst the valiant slain, The warrior's bier had been thy lot, E'en though on red Culloden's plain, We then had mourn'd thee not. But darkly closed thy dawn of fame, That dawn whose sunbeam rose so fair; Vengeance alone may breathe thy name, The watchword of Despair! Yet oh! if gallant spirit's power Hath e'er ennobled death like thine, Then glory mark'd thy parting hour, Last of a mighty line! O'er thy own towers the sunshine falls, But cannot chase their silent gloom; Those beams that gild thy native walls Are sleeping on thy tomb! Spring on thy mountains laughs the while, Thy green woods wave in vernal air, But the loved scenes may vainly smile: Not e'en thy dust is there. On thy blue hills no bugle-sound Is mingling with the torrent's roar, Unmark'd, the wild deer sport around: Thou lead'st the chace no more! Thy gates are closed, thy halls are still, Those halls where peal'd the choral strain; They hear the wind's deep murmuring thrill, And all is hush'd again. No banner from the lonely tower Shall wave its blazon'd folds on high; There the tall grass, and summer flower, Unmark'd shall spring and die. No more thy bard, for other ear, Shall wake the harp once loved by thine— Hush'd be the strain thou canst not hear, Last of a mighty line! THE CRUSADERS' WAR-SONG. Chieftains, lead on! our hearts beat high, Lead on to Salem's towers! Who would not deem it bliss to die, Slain in a cause like ours? The brave who sleep in soil of thine, Die not entomb'd but shrined, O Palestine! Souls of the slain in holy war! Look from your sainted rest. Tell us ye rose in Glory's car, To mingle with the blest; Tell us how short the death-pang's power, How bright the joys of your immortal bower. Strike the loud harp, ye minstrel train! Pour forth your loftiest lays; Each heart shall echo to the strain Breath'd in the warrior's praise. Bid every string triumphant swell Th' inspiring sounds that heroes love so well. Salem! amidst the fiercest hour, The wildest rage of fight, Thy name shall lend our falchions power, And nerve our hearts with might. Envied be those for thee that fall, Who find their graves beneath thy sacred wall. For them no need that sculptured tomb Should chronicle their fame, Or pyramid record their doom; Or deathless verse their name; It is enough that dust of thine Should shroud their forms, O blessed Palestine! Chieftains, lead on! our hearts beat high For combat's glorious hour; Soon shall the red-cross banner fly On Salem's loftiest tower! We burn to mingle in the strife, Where but to die ensures eternal life. THE DEATH OF CLANRONALD. It was in the battle of Sheriffmoor that young Clanronald fell, leading on the Highlanders of the right wing. His death dispirited the assailants, who began to waver. But Glengary, chief of a rival branch of the Clan Colla, started from the ranks, and, waving his bonnet round his head, cried out, “To-day for revenge, and to-morrow for mourning! The Highlanders received a new impulse from his words, and, charging with redoubled fury, bore down all before them.—See the Quarterly Review article of “Culloden Papers.” Oh! ne'er be Clanronald the valiant forgot! Still fearless and first in the combat, he fell; But we paused not one tear-drop to shed o'er the spot, We spared not one moment to murmur “Farewell.’ We heard but the battle-word given by the chief, “To-day for revenge, and to-morrow for grief!” And wildly, Clanronald! we echo'd the vow, With the tear on our cheek, and the sword in our hand; Young son of the brave! we may weep for thee now, For well has thy death been avenged by thy band, When they join'd, in wild chorus, the cry of the chief, “To-day for revenge, and to-morrow for grief!” Thy dirge in that hour was the bugle's wild call, The clash of the claymore, the shout of the brave; But now thy own bard may lament for thy fall, And the soft voice of melody sigh o'er thy grave— While Albyn remembers the words of the chief, “To-day for revenge, and to-morrow for grief!” Thou art fallen, O fearless one! flower of thy race: Descendant of heroes! thy glory is set: But thy kindred, the sons of the battle and chase, Have proved that thy spirit is bright in them yet! Nor vainly have echo'd the words of the chief, “To-day for revenge, and to-morrow for grief!” TO THE EYE. Throne of expression! whence the spirit's ray Pours forth so oft the light of mental day, Where fancy's fire, affection's melting beam, Thought, genius, passion, reign in turn supreme, And many a feeling, words can ne'er impart, Finds its own language to pervade the heart; Thy power, bright orb, what bosom hath not felt, To thrill, to rouse, to fascinate, to melt! And by some spell of undefined control, With magnet-influence touch the secret soul! Light of the features! in the morn of youth Thy glance is nature, and thy language, truth; And ere the world, with all-corrupting sway, Hath taught e'en thee to flatter and betray, Th' ingenuous heart forbids thee to reveal, Or speak one thought that interest would conceal; While yet thou seem'st the cloudless mirror, given But to reflect the purity of heaven; O! then how lovely, there unveil'd, to trace Th' unsullied brightness of each mental grace! When Genius lends thee all his living light, Where the full beams of intellect unite; When love illumes thee with his varying ray, Where trembling Hope and tearful Rapture play; Or Pity's melting cloud thy beam subdues, Tempering its lustre with a veil of dews; Still does thy power, whose all-commanding spell Can pierce the mazes of the soul so well, Bid some new feeling to existence start, From its deep slumbers in the inmost heart. And O! when thought, in ecstasy sublime, That soars triumphant o'er the bounds of time, Fires thy keen glance with inspiration's blaze, The light of heaven, the hope of nobler days, (As glorious dreams, for utterance far too high, Flash through the mist of dim mortality;) Who does not own, that through thy lightning-beam A flame unquenchable, unearthly, streams? That pure, though captive effluence of the sky, The vestal-ray, the spark that cannot die! THE HERO'S DEATH. Life's parting beams were in his eye, Life's closing accents on his tongue, When round him, pealing to the sky, The shout of victory rung! Then, ere his gallant spirit fled, A smile so bright illumed his face— Oh! never, of the light it shed, Shall memory lose a trace! His was a death, whose rapture high Transcended all that life could yield; His warmest prayer was so to die, On the red battle-field! And they may feel, who loved him most, A pride so holy and so pure: Fate hath no power o'er those who boast A treasure thus secure! STANZAS ON THE LATE NATIONAL CALAMITY, THE DEATH OF THE PRINCESS CHARLOTTE. “Hélas! nous composions son histoire de tout ce qu'on peut imaginer de plus glorieux—Le passé et le présent nous garantissoient l'avenir—Telle étoit l'agréable histoire que nous faisions; et pour achever ces nobles projets, il n'y avoit que la durée de sa vie; dont nous ne croyions pas devoir être en peine, car, qui eût pu seulement penser, que les annés eussent dû manquer, a une jeunesse qui sembloit si vive?” Bossuet. I Mark'd ye the mingling of the city's throng, Each mien, each glance, with expectation bright? Prepare the pageant, and the choral song, The pealing chimes, the blaze of festal light! And hark! what rumour's gathering sound is nigh? Is it the voice of joy, that murmur deep? Away! be hush'd! ye sounds of revelry. Back to your homes, ye multitudes, to weep! Weep! for the storm hath o'er us darkly past, And England's royal flower is broken by the blast! II Was it a dream? so sudden and so dread That awful fiat o'er our senses came! So loved, so blest, is that young spirit fled, Whose early grandeur promised years of fame? Oh! when hath life possess'd, or death destroy'd More lovely hopes, more cloudlessly that smiled? When hath the spoiler left so dark a void? For all is lost—the mother and her child! Our morning-star hath vanish'd, and the tomb Throws its deep lengthen'd shade o'er distant years to come. III Angel of Death! did no presaging sign Announce thy coming, and thy way prepare? No warning voice, no harbinger was thine, Danger and fear seem'd past—but thou wert there! Prophetic sounds along the earthquake's path Foretel the hour of nature's awful throes; And the volcano, ere it burst in wrath, Sends forth some herald from its dread repose: But thou, dark Spirit! swift and unforeseen, Cam'st like the lightning's flash, when heaven is all serene. IV And she is gone—the royal and the young, In soul commanding, and in heart benign; Who, from a race of kings and heroes sprung, Glow'd with a spirit lofty as her line. Now may the voice she loved on earth so well, Breathe forth her name, unheeded and in vain; Nor can those eyes on which her own would dwell, Wake from that breast one sympathy again: The ardent heart, the towering mind are fled, Yet shall undying love still linger with the dead. V Oh! many a bright existence we have seen Quench'd, in the glow and fulness of its prime; And many a cherish'd flower, ere now, hath been Cropt, ere its leaves were breathed upon by time. We have lost heroes in their noon of pride, Whose fields of triumph gave them but a bier; And we have wept when soaring genius died, Check'd in the glory of his mid career! But here our hopes were center'd—all is o'er. All thought in this absorb'd—she was—and is no more! VI We watch'd her childhood from its earliest hour, From every word and look blest omens caught; While that young mind developed all its power, And rose to energies of loftiest thought. On her was fix'd the patriot's ardent eye, One hope still bloom'd—one vista still was fair; And when the tempest swept the troubled sky, She was our dayspring—all was cloudless there; And oh! how lovely broke on England's gaze, E'en through the mist and storm, the light of distant days. VII Now hath one moment darken'd future years, And changed the track of ages yet to be!— Yet, mortal! 'midst the bitterness of tears, Kneel, and adore th' inscrutable decree! Oh! while the clear perspective smiled in light, Wisdom should then have temper'd hope's excess, And, lost One! when we saw thy lot so bright, We might have trembled at its loveliness: Joy is no earthly flower—nor framed to bear, In its exotic bloom, life's cold, ungenial air. VIII All smiled around thee—Youth, and Love, and Praise, Hearts all devotion and all truth were thine! On thee was riveted a nation's gaze, As on some radiant and unsullied shrine. Heiress of empires! thou art pass'd away, Like some fair vision, that arose to throw, O'er one brief hour of life, a fleeting ray, Then leave the rest to solitude and wo! Oh! who shall dare to woo such dreams again! Who hath not wept to know, that tears for thee were vain? IX Yet there is one who loved thee—and whose soul With mild affections nature form'd to melt; His mind hath bow'd beneath the stern control Of many a grief—but this shall be unfelt! Years have gone by—and given his honour'd head A diadem of snow—his eye is dim— Around him Heaven a solemn cloud hath spread, The past, the future, are a dream to him! Yet, in the darkness of his fate, alone He dwells on earth, while thou, in life's full pride art gone! X The Chastener's hand is on us—we may weep, But not repine—for many a storm hath past, And, pillow'd on her own majestic deep, Hath England slept, unshaken by the blast! And War hath raged o'er many a distant plain, Trampling the vine and olive in his path; While she, that regal daughter of the main, Smiled, in serene defiance of his wrath! As some proud summit, mingling with the sky, Hears calmly far below the thunders roll and die. XI Her voice hath been th' awakener—and her name The gathering word of nations—in her might, And all the awful beauty of her fame, Apart she dwelt, in solitary light. High on her cliffs, alone and firm she stood, Fixing the torch upon her beacon-tower; That torch, whose flame, far streaming o'er the flood, Hath guided Europe through her darkest hour Away, vain dreams of glory!—in the dust Be humbled, ocean-queen! and own thy sentence just! XII Hark! 'twas the death bell's note! which, full and deep, Unmix'd with aught of less majestic tone, While all the murmurs of existence sleep, Swell'd on the stillness of the air alone! Silent the throngs that fill the darken'd street, Silent the slumbering Thames, the lonely mart; And all is still, where countless thousands meet, Save the full throbbing of the awe-struck heart! All deeply, strangely, fearfully serene, As in each ravaged home th' avenging one had been. XIII The sun goes down in beauty—his farewell, Unlike the world he leaves, is calmly bright; And his last mellow'd rays around us dwell, Lingering, as if on scenes of young delight. They smile and fade—but, when the day is o'er, What slow procession moves, with measured tread?— Lo! those who weep, with her who weeps no more, A solemn train—the mourners and the dead! While, throned on high, the moon's untroubled ray Looks down, as earthly hopes are passing thus away. XIV But other light is in that holy pile, Where, in the house of silence, kings repose; There, through the dim arcade, and pillar'd aisle, The funeral torch its deep-red radiance throws. There pall, and canopy, and sacred strain, And all around the stamp of woe may bear; But Grief, to whose full heart those forms are vain, Grief unexpress'd, unsoothed by them—is there. No darker hour hath Fate for him who mourns, Than when the all he loved, as dust, to dust returns. XV We mourn—but not thy fate, departed One! We pity—but the living, not the dead; A cloud hangs o'er us— And we are for the dark.”—Shakspeare.“the bright day is done,” And with a father's hopes, a nation's fled. And he, the chosen of thy youthful breast, Whose soul with thine had mingled every thought; He, with thine early fond affections blest, Lord of a mind with all things lovely fraught; What but a desert to his eye, that earth, Which but retains of thee the memory of thy worth? XVI Oh! there are griefs for nature too intense, Whose first rude shock but stupifies the soul; Nor hath the fragile and o'erlabour'd sense Strength e'en to feel, at once, their dread control. But when 'tis past, that still and speechless hour Of the seal'd bosom, and the tearless eye, Then the roused mind awakes, with tenfold power To grasp the fulness of its agony! Its death-like torpor vanish'd—and its doom; To cast its own dark hues o'er life and nature's bloom. XVII And such his lot, whom thou hast loved and left. Spirit! thus early to thy home recall'd! So sinks the heart, of hope and thee bereft, A warrior's heart, which danger ne'er appall'd. Years may pass on—and, as they roll along, Mellow those pangs which now his bosom rend; And he once more, with life's unheeding throng, May, though alone in soul, in seeming blend; Yet still, the guardian-angel of his mind Shall thy loved image dwell, in Memory's temple shrined. XVIII Yet must the days be long ere time shall steal Aught from his grief whose spirit dwells with thee; Once deeply bruised, the heart at length may heal, But all it was—oh! never more shall be. The flower, the leaf, o'erwhelm'd by winter snow, Shall spring again, when beams and showers return The faded cheek again with health may glow, And the dim eye with life's warm radiance burn; But the pure freshness of the mind's young bloom, Once lost, revives alone in worlds beyond the tomb. XIX But thou—thine hour of agony is o'er, And thy brief race in brilliance hath been run, While Faith, that bids fond nature grieve no more, Tells that thy crown—though not on earth—is won. Thou, of the world so early left, hast known Nought but the bloom and sunshine—and for thee, Child of propitious stars! for thee alone, The course of love ran smooth, “The course of true love never did run smooth.” Shakspeare.and brightly free— Not long such bliss to mortal could be given, It is enough for earth to catch one glimpse of heaven. XX What though, ere yet the noonday of thy fame Rose in its glory on thine England's eye, The grave's deep shadows o'er thy prospect came? Ours is that loss—and thou wert blest to die! Thou might'st have lived to dark and evil years, To mourn thy people changed, thy skies o'ercast; But thy spring morn was all undimm'd by tears, And thou wert loved and cherish'd to the last! And thy young name, ne'er breathed in ruder tone, Thus dying, thou hast left to love and grief alone. XXI Daughter of Kings! from that high sphere look down, Where still in hope, affection's thoughts may rise; Where dimly shines to thee that mortal crown, Which earth display'd to claim thee from the skies. Look down! and if thy spirit yet retain Memory of aught that once was fondly dear, Soothe, though unseen, the hearts that mourn in vain, And, in their hours of loneliness—be near! Blest was thy lot e'en here—and one faint sigh, Oh! tell those hearts, hath made that bliss eternity! Nov. 23, 1817.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. III. THE SCEPTIC. “Leur raison, qu'ils prennent pour guide, ne présente à leur esprit que des conjectures et des embarras; les absurdités où ils tombent en niant la Religion deviennent plus insoutenables que les verités dont la hauteur les étonne; et pour ne vouloir pas croire des mystères incompréhensibles, ils suivent l'une après l'autre d'incompréhensibles erreurs.” Bossuet, Oraisons Funébres. When the young Eagle, with exulting eye, Has learn'd to dare the splendour of the sky, And leave the Alps beneath him in his course, To bathe his crest in morn's empyreal source; Will his free wing, from that majestic height, Descend to follow some wild meteor's light, Which, far below, with evanescent fire, Shines to delude, and dazzles to expire? No! still through clouds he wins his upward way, And proudly claims his heritage of day! —And shall the spirit, on whose ardent gaze The dayspring from on high hath pour'd its blaze, Turn from that pure effulgence, to the beam Of earth-born light, that sheds a treacherous gleam, Luring the wanderer, from the star of faith, To the deep valley of the shades of death? What bright exchange, what treasure shall be given, For the high birthright of its hope in Heaven? If lost the gem which empires could not buy, What yet remains?—a dark eternity! Is earth still Eden?—might a Seraph guest, Still 'midst its chosen bowers delighted rest? Is all so cloudless and so calm below, We seek no fairer scenes than life can show? That the cold Sceptic, in his pride elate, Rejects the promise of a brighter state, And leaves the rock, no tempest shall displace, To rear his dwelling on the quicksand's base? Votary of doubt! then join the festal throng, Bask in the sunbeam, listen to the song, Spread the rich board, and fill the wine-cup high, And bind the wreath ere yet the roses die! 'Tis well, thine eye is yet undimm'd by time, And thy heart bounds, exulting in its prime; Smile then unmoved at Wisdom's warning voice, And, in the glory of thy strength, rejoice! But life hath sterner tasks; e'en youth's brief hours Survive the beauty of their loveliest flowers; The founts of joy, where pilgrims rest from toil, Are few and distant on the desert soil; The soul's pure flame the breath of storms must fan, And pain and sorrow claim their nursling—Man! Earth's noblest sons the bitter cup have shared— Proud child of reason! how art thou prepared? When years, with silent might, thy frame have bow'd, And o'er thy spirit cast their wintry cloud, Will Memory soothe thee on thy bed of pain With the bright images of pleasure's train? Yes! as the sight of some far-distant shore, Whose well-known scenes his foot shall tread no more, Would cheer the seaman, by the eddying wave Drawn, vainly struggling, to th' unfathom'd grave! Shall Hope, the faithful cherub, hear thy call, She who, like heaven's own sunbeam, smiles for all? Will she speak comfort?—Thou hast shorn her plume, That might have raised thee far above the tomb, And hush'd the only voice whose angel tone Soothes when all melodies of joy are flown! For she was born beyond the stars to soar, And kindling at the source of life, adore; Thou could'st not, mortal! rivet to the earth Her eye, whose beam is of celestial birth; She dwells with those who leave her pinion free, And sheds the dews of heaven on all but thee. Yet few there are so lonely, so bereft, But some true heart, that beats to theirs, is left, And, haply, one whose strong affection's power Unchanged may triumph through misfortune's hour, Still with fond care supports thy languid head, And keeps unwearied vigils by thy bed. But thou whose thoughts have no blest home above! Captive of earth! and canst thou dare to love? To nurse such feelings as delight to rest, Within that hallow'd shrine—a parent's breast, To fix each hope, concentrate every tie, On one frail idol—destined but to die; Yet mock the faith that points to worlds of light, Where sever'd souls, made perfect, re-unite? Then tremble! cling to every passing joy, Twined with the life a moment may destroy! If there be sorrow in a parting tear, Still let “for ever” vibrate on thine ear! If some bright hour on rapture's wing hath flown, Find more than anguish in the thought—'tis gone! Go! to a voice such magic influence give, Thou canst not lose its melody, and live; And make an eye the lode-star of thy soul, And let a glance the springs of thought control; Gaze on a mortal form with fond delight, Till the fair vision mingles with thy sight; There seek thy blessings, there repose thy trust, Lean on the willow, idolize the dust! Then, when thy treasure best repays thy care, Think on that dread “for ever”—and despair! And oh! no strange, unwonted storm there needs, To wreck at once thy fragile ark of reeds. Watch well its course—explore with anxious eye Each little cloud that floats along the sky— Is the blue canopy serenely fair? Yet may the thunderbolt unseen be there, And the bark sink, when peace and sunshine sleep On the smooth bosom of the waveless deep! Yes! ere a sound, a sign, announce thy fate, May the blow fall which makes thee desolate! Not always Heaven's destroying angel shrouds His awful form in tempests and in clouds; He fills the summer air with latent power, He hides his venom in the scented flower, He steals upon thee in the Zephyr's breath, And festal garlands veil the shafts of death! Where art thou then, who thus didst rashly cast Thine all upon the mercy of the blast, And vainly hope the tree of life to find Rooted in sands that flit before the wind? Is not that earth thy spirit loved so well It wish'd not in a brighter sphere to dwell, Become a desert now, a vale of gloom, O'ershadow'd with the midnight of the tomb? Where shalt thou turn?—it is not thine to raise To yon pure heaven thy calm confiding gaze, No gleam reflected from that realm of rest Steals on the darkness of thy troubled breast; Not for thine eye shall Faith divinely shed Her glory round the image of the dead; And if, when slumber's lonely couch is prest, The form departed by thy spirit's guest, It bears no light from purer worlds to this; Thy future lends not e'en a dream of bliss. But who shall dare the gate of life to close, Or say, thus far the stream of mercy flows? That fount unseal'd, whose boundless waves embrace Each distant isle, and visit every race, Pours from the throne of God its current free, Nor yet denies th' immortal draught to thee. O! while the doom impends, not yet decreed, While yet th' Atoner hath not ceased to plead, While still, suspended by a single hair, The sharp bright sword hangs quivering in the air, Bow down thy heart to Him who will not break The bruised reed; e'en yet, awake, awake! Patient, because Eternal, He may hear Thy prayer of agony with pitying ear, And send his chastening Spirit from above, O'er the deep chaos of thy soul to move. But seek thou mercy through His name alone, To whose unequall'd sorrows none was shown. Through Him, who here in mortal garb abode, As man to suffer, and to heal as God; And, born the sons of utmost time to bless, Endured all scorn, and aided all distress. Call thou on Him—for He, in human form, Hath walk'd the waves of life, and still'd the storm. He, when her hour of lingering grace was past, O'er Salem wept, relenting to the last, Wept with such tears as Judah's monarch pour'd O'er his lost child, ungrateful, yet deplored; And, offering guiltless blood that guilt might live, Taught from his Cross the lesson—to forgive! Call thou on Him—his prayer e'en then arose, Breathed in unpitied anguish for his foes. And haste!—ere bursts the lightning from on high, Fly to the City of thy Refuge, fly! So shall th' Avenger turn his steps away, And sheath his falchion, baffled of its prey. Yet must long days roll on, ere peace shall brood, As the soft halcyon, o'er thy heart subdued; Ere yet the dove of Heaven descend, to shed Inspiring influence o'er thy fallen head. —He, who hath pined in dungeons, 'midst the shade Of such deep night as man for man hath made, Through lingering years; if call'd at length to be, Once more, by nature's boundless charter, free, Shrinks feebly back, the blaze of noon to shun, Fainting at day, and blasted by the sun. Thus, when the captive soul hath long remain'd In its own dread abyss of darkness chain'd, If the Deliverer, in his might, at last, Its fetters, born of earth, to earth should cast, The beam of truth o'erpowers its dazzled sight, Trembling it sinks, and finds no joy in light But this will pass away—that spark of mind, Within thy frame unquenchably enshrined, Shall live to triumph in its bright'ning ray, Born to be foster'd with ethereal day. Then wilt thou bless the hour, when o'er thee pass'd, On wing of flame, the purifying blast, And sorrow's voice, through paths before untrod, Like Sinai's trumpet, call'd thee to thy God! But hopest thou, in thy panoply of pride, Heaven's messenger, affliction, to deride? In thine own strength unaided to defy, With Stoic smile, the arrows of the sky? Torn by the vulture, fetter'd to the rock, Still, demigod! the tempest wilt thou mock? Alas! the tower that crests the mountain's brow A thousand years may awe the vale below, Yet not the less be shatter'd on its height, By one dread moment of the earthquake's might! A thousand pangs thy bosom may have borne, In silent fortitude, or haughty scorn, Till comes the one, the master-anguish, sent To break the mighty heart that ne'er was bent. Oh! what is nature's strength? the vacant eye, By mind deserted, hath a dread reply! The wild delirious laughter of despair, The mirth of frenzy—seek an answer there! Turn not away, though pity's cheek grow pale, Close not thine ear against their awful tale. They tell thee, Reason, wandering from the ray Of Faith, the blazing pillar of her way, In the mid-darkness of the stormy wave, Forsook the struggling soul she could not save! Weep not, sad moralist! o'er desert plains, Strew'd with the wrecks of grandeur—mouldering fanes, Arches of triumph, long with weeds o'ergrown, And regal cities, now the serpent's own: Earth has more awful ruins—one lost mind, Whose star is quench'd, hath lessons for mankind, Of deeper import than each prostrate dome, Mingling its marble with the dust of Rome. But who, with eye unshrinking, shall explore That waste, illumed by reason's beam no more? Who pierce the deep, mysterious clouds that roll Around the shatter'd temple of the soul, Curtain'd with midnight?—low its columns lie, And dark the chambers of its imag'ry, Sunk are its idols now—and God alone May rear the fabric, by their fall o'erthrown! Yet, from its inmost shrine, by storms laid bare, Is heard an oracle that cries—“Beware! Child of the dust! but ransomed of the skies! One breath of Heaven—and thus thy glory dies! Haste, ere the hour of doom—draw nigh to him Who dwells above between the cherubim!” Spirit dethroned! and check'd in mid career, Son of the morning! exiled from thy sphere, Tell us thy tale!—Perchance thy race was run With science, in the chariot of the sun; Free as the winds the paths of space to sweep, Traverse the untrodden kingdoms of the deep, And search the laws that Nature's springs control, There tracing all—save Him who guides the whole! Haply thine eye its ardent glance had cast Through the dim shades, the portals of the past; By the bright lamp of thought thy care had fed From the far beacon-lights of ages fled, The depths of time exploring, to retrace The glorious march of many a vanish'd race. Or did thy power pervade the living lyre, Till its deep chords became intinct with fire, Silenced all meaner notes, and swell'd on high, Full and alone, their mighty harmony, While woke each passion from its cell profound, And nations started at th' electric sound? Lord of th' ascendant! what avails it now, Though bright the laurels waved upon thy brow? What, though thy name, through distant empires heard, Bade the heart bound, as doth a battle-word? Was it for this thy still-unwearied eye Kept vigil with the watchfires of the sky, To make the secrets of all ages thine, And commune with majestic thoughts that shine O'er Time's long shadowy pathway?—hath thy mind Sever'd its lone dominions from mankind, For this to woo their homage?—Thou hast sought All, save the wisdom with salvation fraught, Won every wreath—but that which will not die, Nor aught neglected—save eternity! And did all fail thee, in the hour of wrath, When burst th' o'erwhelming vials on thy path? Could not the voice of Fame inspire thee then, O spirit! scepter'd by the sons of men, With an immortal's courage, to sustain The transient agonies of earthly pain? —One, one there was, all-powerful to have saved, When the loud fury of the billow raved; But him thou knew'st not—and the light he lent Hath vanish'd from its ruin'd tenement, But left thee breathing, moving, lingering yet, A thing we shrink from—vainly to forget! —Lift the dread veil no further—hide, oh! hide The bleeding form, the couch of suicide! The dagger, grasp'd in death—the brow, the eye, Lifeless, yet stamp'd with rage and agony; The soul's dark traces left in many a line Graved on his mein, who died,—“and made no sign!” Approach not, gaze not—lest thy fever'd brain Too deep that image of despair retain; Angels of slumber! o'er the midnight hour, Let not such visions claim unhallow'd power, Lest the mind sink with terror, and above See but th' Avenger's arm, forget th' Atoner's love! O Thou! th'unseen, th' all-seeing!—Thou whose ways, Mantled with darkness, mock all finite gaze, Before whose eyes the creatures of Thy hand, Seraph and man, alike in weakness stand, And countless ages, trampling into clay Earth's empires on their march, are but a day; Father of worlds unknown, unnumber'd!—Thou, With whom all time is one eternal now, Who know'st no past, nor future — Thou whose breath Goes forth, and bears to myriads, life or death! Look on us, guide us!—wanderers of a sea Wild and obscure, what are we, reft of Thee? A thousand rocks, deep-hid, elude our sight, A star may set—and we are lost in night; A breeze may waft us to the whirlpool's brink, A treach'rous song allure us—and we sink! Oh! by His love, who, veiling Godhead's light, To moments circumscribed the Infinite, And Heaven and Earth disdain'd not to ally By that dread union—Man with Deity; Immortal tears o'er mortal woes who shed, And, ere he raised them, wept above the dead; Save, or we perish!—Let Thy word control The earthquakes of that universe—the soul; Pervade the depths of passion—speak once more The mighty mandate, guard of every shore, “Here shall thy waves be stay'd”—in grief, in pain, The fearful poise of reason's sphere maintain, Thou, by whom suns are balanced!—thus secure In Thee shall Faith and Fortitude endure; Conscious of Thee, unfaltering, shall the just Look upward still, in high and holy trust, And by affliction guided to Thy shrine, The first, last thought of suffering hearts be Thine. And oh! be near, when, clothed with conquering power, The King of Terrors claims his own dread hour: When, on the edge of that unknown abyss, Which darkly parts us from the realm of bliss, Awe-struck alike the timid and the brave, Alike subdued the monarch and the slave, Must drink the cup of trembling—when we see Nought in the universe but Death and Thee, Forsake us not—if still, when life was young, Faith to thy bosom, as her home, hath sprung, If Hope's retreat hath been, through all the past, The shadow by the Rock of Ages cast, Father, forsake us not!—when tortures urge The shrinking soul to that mysterious verge; When from Thy justice to Thy love we fly, On Nature's conflict look with pitying eye, Bid the strong wind, the fire, the earthquake cease, Come in the still small voice, and whisper—peace! For oh! 'tis awful—He that hath beheld The parting spirit, by its fears repell'd, Cling in weak terror to its earthly chain, And from the dizzy brink recoil, in vain; He that hath seen the last convulsive throe Dissolve the union form'd and closed in woe, Well knows that hour is awful.—In the pride Of youth and health, by sufferings yet untried, We talk of Death, as something, which 'twere sweet In Glory's arms exultingly to meet, A closing triumph, a majestic scene, Where gazing nations watch the hero's mien, As, undismay'd amidst the tears of all, He folds his mantle, regally to fall! Hush, fond enthusiast!—still, obscure and lone, Yet not less terrible because unknown, Is the last hour of thousands—they retire From life's throng'd path, unnoticed to expire; As the light leaf, whose fall to ruin bears Some trembling insect's little world of cares, Descends in silence—while around waves on The mighty forest, reckless what is gone! Such is man's doom—and, ere an hour be flown, —Start not, thou trifler!—such may be thine own. But, as life's current in its ebb draws near The shadowy gulf, there wakes a thought of fear, A thrilling thought, which haply mock'd before, We fain would stifle—but it sleeps no more! There are who fly its murmurs 'midst the throng, That join the masque of revelry and song; Yet still Death's image, by its power restored, Frowns 'midst the roses of the festal board, And when deep shades o'er earth and ocean brood, And the heart owns the might of solitude, Is its low whisper heard?—a note profound, But wild and startling as the trumpet sound, That bursts, with sudden blast, the dead repose Of some proud city, storm'd by midnight foes! Oh! vainly Reason's scornful voice would prove That life hath nought to claim such lingering love, And ask if e'er the captive, half unchain'd, Clung to the links which yet his step restrain'd? In vain Philosophy, with tranquil pride, Would mock the feelings she perchance can hide, Call up the countless armies of the dead, Point to the pathway beaten by their tread, And say—“What wouldst thou? Shall the fix'd decree, Made for creation, be reversed for thee?” —Poor, feeble aid!—proud Stoic! ask not why, It is enough, that nature shrinks to die! Enough, that horror, which thy words upbraid, Is her dread penalty, and must be paid! —Search thy deep wisdom, solve the scarce defined And mystic questions of the parting mind, Half check'd, half utter'd—tell her, what shall burst, In whelming grandeur, on her vision first, When freed from mortal films?—what viewless world Shall first receive her wing, but half unfurl'd? What awful and unbodied beings guide Her timid flight through regions yet untried? Say, if at once, her final doom to hear, Before her God the trembler must appear, Or wait that day of terror, when the sea Shall yield its hidden dead, and heaven and earth shall flee? Hast thou no answer?—then deride no more The thoughts that shrink, yet cease not to explore Th' unknown, th' unseen, the future—though the heart, As at unearthly sounds, before them start; Though the frame shudder, and the spirit sigh, They have their source in immortality! Whence, then, shall strength, which reason's aid denies, An equal to the mortal conflict rise? When, on the swift pale horse, whose lightning pace, Where'er we fly, still wins the dreadful race, The mighty rider comes—O whence shall aid Be drawn, to meet his rushing, undismay'd? —Whence, but from thee, Messiah!—thou hast drain'd The bitter cup, till not the dregs remain'd; To thee the struggle and the pang were known, The mystic horror—all became thine own! But did no hand celestial succour bring, Till scorn and anguish haply lost their sting? Came not th' Archangel, in the final hour, To arm thee with invulnerable power? No, Son of God! upon thy sacred head The shafts of wrath their tenfold fury shed, From man averted—and thy path on high Pass'd through the strait of fiercest agony; For thus th' Eternal, with propitious eyes, Received the last, th' almighty sacrifice! But wake! be glad, ye nations! from the tomb Is won the vict'ry, and is fled the gloom! The vale of death in conquest hath been trod, Break forth in joy, ye ransom'd! saith your God! Swell ye the raptures of the song afar, And hail with harps your bright and Morning Star. He rose! the everlasting gates of day Received the King of Glory on his way! The hope, the comforter of those who wept, And the first-fruits of them, in Him that slept. He rose, he triumph'd! he will yet sustain Frail nature sinking in the strife of pain. Aided by Him, around the martyr's frame When fiercely blazed a living shroud of flame, Hath the firm soul exulted, and the voice Raised the victorious hymn, and cried, Rejoice! Aided by Him, though none the bed attend, Where the lone sufferer dies without a friend, He whom the busy world shall miss no more Than morn one dewdrop from her countless store, Earth's most neglected child, with trusting heart, Call'd to the hope of glory, shall depart! And say, cold Sophist! if by thee bereft Of that high hope, to misery what were left? But for the vision of the days to be, But for the comforter, despised by thee, Should we not wither at the Chastener's look, Should we not sink beneath our God's rebuke, When o'er our heads the desolating blast, Fraught with inscrutable decrees, hath pass'd, And the stern power who seeks the noblest prey, Hath call'd our fairest and our best away? Should we not madden when our eyes behold All that we loved in marble stillness cold, No more responsive to our smile or sigh, Fix'd—frozen—silent—all mortality? But for the promise, all shall yet be well, Would not the spirit in its pangs rebel, Beneath such clouds as darken'd, when the hand Of wrath lay heavy on our prostrate land; And thou, The Prineess Charlotte. just lent thy gladden'd isles to bless, Then snatch'd from earth with all thy loveliness, With all a nation's blessings on thy head, O England's flower! wert gather'd to the dead? But Thou didst teach us. Thou to every heart, Faith's lofty lesson didst thyself impart! When fled the hope through all thy pangs which smiled, When thy young bosom, o'er thy lifeless child, Yearn'd with vain longing—still thy patient eye, To its last light, beam'd holy constancy! Torn from a lot in cloudless sunshine cast, Amidst those agonies—thy first and last, Thy pale lip, quivering with convulsive throes, Breathed not a plaint—and settled in repose; While bow'd thy royal head to Him, whose power Spoke in the fiat of that midnight hour, Who from the brightest vision of a throne, Love, glory, empire, claim'd thee for his own, And spread such terror o'er the sea-girt coast, As blasted Israel, when her Ark was lost! “It is the will of God!”—yet, yet we hear The words which closed thy beautiful career; Yet should we mourn thee in thy blest abode, But for that thought—“It is the will of God!” Who shall arraign th' Eternal's dark decree, If not one murmur then escaped from thee? Oh! still, though vanishing without a trace, Thou hast not left one scion of thy race, Still may thy memory bloom our vales among, Hallow'd by freedom, and enshrined in song! Still may thy pure, majestic spirit dwell, Bright on the isles which loved thy name so well, E'en as an angel, with presiding care, To wake and guard thine own high virtues there. For lo! the hour when storm-presaging skies Call on the watchers of the land to rise, To set the sign of fire on every height, And o'er the mountains rear, with patriot might, Prepared, if summon'd, in its cause to die, The banner of our faith, the Cross of victory! By this hath England conquer'd—field and flood Have own'd her sov'reignty—alone she stood, When chains o'er all the scepter'd earth were thrown, In high and holy singleness, alone, But mighty in her God—and shall she now Forget before th' Omnipotent to bow? From the bright fountain of her glory turn, Or bid strange fire upon his altars burn? No! sever'd land, 'midst rocks and billows rude, Throned in thy majesty of solitude, Still in the deep asylum of thy breast Shall the pure elements of greatness rest, Virtue and faith, the tutelary powers, Thy hearths that hallow, and defend thy towers! Still, where thy hamlet-vales, O chosen isle! In the soft beauty of their verdure smile, Where yew and elm o'ershade the lowly fanes, That guard the peasant's records and remains, May the blest echoes of the Sabbath-bell Sweet on the quiet of the woodlands swell, And from each cottage-dwelling of thy glades, When starlight glimmers through the deep'ning shades, Devotion's voice in choral hymns arise, And bear the land's warm incense to the skies. There may the mother, as with anxious joy To Heaven her lessons consecrate her boy, Teach his young accent still the immortal lays Of Zion's bards, in inspiration's days, When angels, whispering through the cedar shade, Prophetic tones to Judah's harp convey'd; And as, her soul all glistening in her eyes, She bids the prayer of infancy arise, Tell of his name, who left his Throne on high, Earth's lowliest lot to bear and sanctify, His love divine, by keenest anguish tried, And fondly say—“My child, for thee He died!” A TALE OF THE SECRET TRIBUNAL. [Part I.] Night veil'd the mountains of the vine, And storms had roused the foaming Rhine, And, mingling with the pinewood's roar, Its billows hoarsely chafed the shore, While glen and cavern, to their moans, Gave answer with a thousand tones: Then, as the voice of storms appall'd The peasant of the Odenwald, The Odenwald, a forest-district near the Rhine, adjoining the territories of Darmstadt. Shuddering he deem'd, that, far on high, 'Twas the wild huntsman rushing by, Riding the blast with phantom speed, With cry of hound, and tramp of steed, While his fierce train, as on they flew, Their horns in savage chorus blew, Till rock, and tower, and convent round, Rung to the shrill unearthly sound. Vain dreams! far other footsteps traced The forest paths, in secret haste; Far other sounds were on the night, Though lost amidst the tempest's might, That fill'd the echoing earth and sky, With its own awful harmony. There stood a lone and ruin'd fane, Far in the Odenwald's domain, 'Midst wood and rock, a deep recess Of still and shadowy loneliness. Long grass its pavement had o'ergrown, The wild-flower waved o'er the altar-stone, The night-wind rock'd the tottering pile, As it swept along the roofless aisle, For the forest-boughs, and the stormy sky, Were all that minster's canopy. Many a broken image lay In the mossy mantle of decay, And partial light the moonbeams darted O'er trophies of the long departed; For there the chiefs of other days, The mighty, slumber'd, with their praise: 'Twas long since aught but the dews of Heaven A tribute to their bier had given, Long since a sound but the moaning blast Above their voiceless home had pass'd. So slept the proud, and with them all The records of their fame and fall; Helmet, and shield, and sculptured crest, Adorn'd the dwelling of their rest, And emblems of the Holy Land Were carved by some forgotten hand; But the helm was broke, the shield defaced, And the crest through weeds might scarce be traced; And the scatter'd leaves of the northern pine Half hid the palm of Palestine. So slept the glorious—lowly laid, As the peasant in his native shade; Some hermit's tale, some shepherd's rhyme, All that high deeds could win from time! What footsteps move, with measured tread, Amid those chambers of the dead? What silent, shadowy beings glide Low tombs and mouldering shrines beside, Peopling the wild and solemn scene With forms well suited to its mien? Wanderer, away! let none intrude On their mysterious solitude! Lo! these are they, that awful band, The secret Watchers of the land, They that, unknown and uncontroll'd, Their dark and dread tribunal hold. They meet not in the monarch's dome, They meet not in the chieftain's home; But where, unbounded o'er their heads, All heaven magnificently spreads, And from its depths of cloudless blue The eternal stars their deeds may view! Where'er the flowers of the mountain sod By roving foot are seldom trod; Where'er the pathless forest waves, Or the ivy clothes forsaken graves; Where'er wild legends mark a spot, By mortals shunn'd, but unforgot, There, circled by the shades of night, They judge of crimes that shrink from light, And guilt, that deems its secret known To the One unslumbering eye alone, Yet hears their name with a sudden start, As an icy touch had chill'd its heart, For the shadow of th' avenger's hand Rests dark and heavy on the land. There rose a voice from the ruin's gloom And woke the echoes of the tomb, As if the noble hearts beneath Sent forth deep answers to its breath. “When the midnight stars are burning, And the dead to earth returning; When the spirits of the blest Rise upon the good man's rest; When each whisper of the gale Bids the cheek of guilt turn pale; In the shadow of the hour That o'er the soul hath deepest power, Why thus meet we, but to call For judgment on the criminal? Why, but the doom of guilt to seal, And point th' avenger's holy steel? A fearful oath has bound our souls, A fearful power our arm controls! There is an ear, awake on high, E'en to thought's whispers, ere they die; There is an eye, whose beam pervades All depths, all deserts, and all shades; That ear hath heard our awful vow, That searching eye is on us now! Let him whose heart is unprofaned, Whose hand no blameless blood hath stain'd— Let him, whose thoughts no record keep Of crimes, in silence buried deep, Here, in the face of Heaven, accuse The guilty whom its wrath pursues!” 'Twas hushed—that voice of thrilling sound, And a dead silence reign'd around. Then stood forth one, whose dim-seen form, Tower'd like a phantom in the storm; Gathering his mantle, as a cloud, With its dark folds his face to shroud, Through pillar'd arches on he pass'd, With stately step, and paused at last, Where, on the altar's mouldering stone, The fitful moonbeam brightly shone; Then on the fearful stillness broke Low, solemn tones, as thus he spoke: “Before that eye, whose glance pervades All depths, all deserts, and all shades; Heard by that ear awake on high E'en to thought's whispers ere they die; With all a mortal's awe I stand, Yet with pure heart, and stainless hand. To Heaven I lift that hand and call For judgment on the criminal; The earth is dyed with bloodshed's hues, It cries for vengeance—I accuse!” “Name thou the guilty! say for whom Thou claim'st th' inevitable doom! “Albert of Lindheim—to the skies The voice of blood against him cries; A brother's blood—his hand is dyed With the deep stain of fratricide. One hour, one moment, hath reveal'd, What years in darkness had conceal'd, But all in vain—the gulf of time Refused to close upon his crime; And guilt that slept on flowers, shall know, The earthquake was but hush'd below! Here, where amidst the noble dead, Awed by their fame, he dare not tread; Where, left by him to dark decay, Their trophies moulder fast away; Around us and beneath us lie The relics of his ancestry; The chiefs of Lindheim's ancient race, Each in his last low dwelling-place: But one is absent—o'er his grave The palmy shades of Syria wave; Far distant from his native Rhine, He died unmourn'd, in Palestine; The Pilgrim sought the Holy Land, To perish by a brother's hand! Peace to his soul! though o'er his bed No dirge be pour'd, no tear be shed, Though all he loved his name forget, They live who shall avenge him yet!” “Accuser! how to thee alone Became the fearful secret known?” “There is an hour when vain remorse First wakes in her eternal force; When pardon may not be retrieved, When conscience will not be deceived. He that beheld the victim bleed, Beheld, and aided in the deed— When earthly fears had lost their power Reveal'd the tale in such an hour, Unfolding, with his latest breath, All that gave keener pangs to death.” “By Him, th' All-seeing and Unseen, Who is for ever, and hath been, And by th' Atoner's cross adored, And by th' avenger's holy sword, By truth eternal and divine, Accuser! wilt thou swear to thine?” —“The cross upon my heart is prest, I hold the dagger to my breast; If false the tale whose truth I swear, Be mine the murderer's doom to bear!” Then sternly rose the dread reply— “His days are number'd—he must die! There is no shadow of the night, So deep as to conceal his flight; Earth doth not hold so lone a waste, But there his footstep shall be traced; Devotion hath no shrine so blest, That there in safety he may rest. Where'er he treads, let Vengeance there Around him spread her secret snare! In the busy haunts of men, In the still and shadowy glen, When the social board is crown'd, When the wine-cup sparkles round; When his couch of sleep is prest, And a dream his spirit's guest; When his bosom knows no fear, Let the dagger still be near, Till, sudden as the lightning's dart, Silent and swift it reach his heart! One warning voice, one fearful word, Ere morn beneath his towers be heard, Then vainly may the guilty fly, Unseen, unaided,—he must die! Let those he loves prepare his tomb, Let friendship lure him to his doom! Perish his deeds, his name, his race, Without a record or a trace! Away! be watchful, swift, and free, To wreak th' invisible's decree. 'Tis pass'd—th' avenger claims his prey, On to the chase of death—away!” And all was still—the sweeping blast Caught not a whisper as it pass'd; The shadowy forms were seen no more, The tombs deserted as before; And the wide forest waved immense, In dark and lone magnificence. In Lindheim's towers the feast had closed; The song was hush'd, the bard reposed; Sleep settled on the weary guest, And the castle's lord retired to rest. To rest!—the captive doom'd to die May slumber, when his hour is nigh; The seaman, when the billows foam, Rock'd on the mast, may dream of home; The warrior, on the battle's eve, May win from care a short reprieve; But earth and heaven alike deny Their peace to guilt's o'erwearied eye; And night, that brings to grief a calm, To toil a pause, to pain a balm, Hath spells terrific in her course, Dread sounds and shadows, for remorse, Voices, that long from earth had fled, And steps and echoes from the dead; And many a dream, whose forms arise, Like a darker world's realities! Call them not vain illusions—born, But for the wise and brave to scorn! Heaven, that the penal doom defers, Hath yet its thousand ministers, To scourge the heart, unseen, unknown, In shade, in silence, and alone, Concentrating in one brief hour Ages of retribution's power! If thou wouldst know the lot of those, Whose souls are dark with guilty woes, Ah! seek them not where pleasure's throng Are listening to the voice of song; Seek them not where the banquet glows, And the red vineyard's nectar flows: There mirth may flush the hollow cheek, The eye of feverish joy may speak, And smiles, the ready mask of pride, The canker-worm within may hide: Heed not those signs! they but delude; Follow, and mark their solitude! The song is hush'd, the feast is done, And Lindheim's lord remains alone, Alone, in silence and unrest, With the dread secret of his breast; Alone with anguish and with fear; —There needs not an avenger here! Behold him!—Why that sudden start? Thou hear'st the beating of thy heart! Thou hear'st the night-wind's hollow sigh, Thou hear'st the rustling tapestry! No sound but these may near thee be; Sleep! all things earthly sleep—but thee. No! there are murmurs on the air, And a voice is heard that cries—“Despair!” And he who trembles fain would deem 'Twas the whisper of a waking dream. Was it but this?—again 'tis there, Again is heard—“Despair! Despair!” 'Tis past—its tones have slowly died In echoes on the mountain side; Heard but by him, they rose, they fell, He knew their fearful meaning well, And shrinking from the midnight gloom, As from the shadow of the tomb, Yet shuddering, turn'd in pale dismay When broke the dawn's first kindling ray, And sought, amidst the forest wild, Some shade where sunbeam never smiled. Yes! hide thee, guilt!—the laughing morn Wakes in a heaven of splendour born! The storms that shook the mountain crest Have sought their viewless world of rest. High from his cliffs, with ardent gaze, Soars the young eagle in the blaze, Exulting, as he wings his way, To revel in the fount of day, And brightly past his banks of vine, In glory, flows the monarch Rhine; And joyous peals the vintage song His wild luxuriant shores along, As peasant bands, from rock and dell, Their strains of choral transport swell; And cliffs of bold fantastic forms, Aspiring to the realm of storms; And woods around, and waves below, Catch the red Orient's deepening glow, That lends each tower, and convent-spire, A tinge of its ethereal fire. Swell high the song of festal hours! Deck ye the shrine with living flowers! Let music o'er the waters breathe! Let beauty twine the bridal wreath! While she, whose blue eye laughs in light, Whose cheek with love's own hue is bright, The fair-hair'd maid of Lindheim's hall, Wakes to her nuptial festival. Oh! who hath seen, in dreams that soar To worlds the soul would fain explore, When, for her own blest country pining, Its beauty o'er her thought is shining, Some form of heaven, whose cloudless eye Was all one beam of ecstasy! Whose glorious brow no traces wore Of guilt, or sorrow known before! Whose smile, undimm'd by aught of earth, A sunbeam of immortal birth, Spoke of bright realms, far distant lying, Where love and joy are both undying! E'en thus—a vision of delight, A beam to gladden mortal sight, A flower whose head no storm had bow'd, Whose leaves ne'er droop'd beneath a cloud; Thus, by the world unstain'd, untried, Seem'd that belov'd and lovely bride; A being all too soft and fair, One breath of earthly woe to bear! Yet lives there many a lofty mind, In light and fragile form enshrined; And oft smooth cheek, and smiling eye, Hide strength to suffer and to die! Judge not of woman's heart in hours That strew her path with summer flowers, When joy's full cup is mantling high, When flattery's blandishments are nigh; Judge her not then! within her breast Are energies unseen, that rest! They wait their call—and grief alone May make the soul's deep secrets known. Yes! let her smile, 'midst pleasure's train Leading the reckless and the vain! Firm on the scaffold she hath stood, Besprinkled with the martyr's blood; Her voice the patriot's heart hath steel'd, Her spirit glow'd on battle-field; Her courage freed from dungeon's gloom The captive brooding o'er his doom; Her faith the fallen monarch saved, Her love the tyrant's fury braved; No scene of danger or despair, But she hath won her triumph there! Away! nor cloud the festal morn With thoughts of boding sadness borne! Far other, lovelier dreams are thine, Fair daughter of a noble line! Young Ella! from thy tower, whose height Hath caught the flush of Eastern light, Watching, while soft the morning air Parts on thy brow the sunny hair, Yon bark, that o'er the calm blue tide Bears thy loved warrior to his bride— He, whose high deeds romantic praise Hath hallow'd with a thousand lays. He came—that youthful chief—he came That favour'd lord of love and fame! His step was hurried—as if one Who seeks a voice within to shun; His cheek was varying, and express'd The conflict of a troubled breast: His eye was anxious—doubt, and dread, And a stern grief, might there be read; Yet all that mark'd his alter'd mien Seem'd struggling to be still unseen. With shrinking heart, with nameless fear, Young Ella met the brow austere, And the wild look, which seem'd to fly The timid welcome of her eye. Was that a lover's gaze, which chill'd The soul, its awful sadness thrill'd? A lover's brow, so darkly fraught With all the heaviest gloom of thought? She trembled—ne'er to grief inured, By its dread lessons ne'er matured: Unused to meet a glance of less Than all a parent's tenderness, Shuddering she felt, through every sense, The death-like faintness of suspense. High o'er the windings of the flood, On Lindheim's terraced rocks they stood, Whence the free sight afar might stray O'er that imperial river's way, Which, rushing from its Alpine source, Makes one long triumph of its course, Rolling in tranquil grandeur by, 'Midst Nature's noblest pageantry. But they, o'er that majestic scene, With clouded brow and anxious mien, In silence gazed:—for Ella's heart Fear'd its own terrors to impart; And he, who vainly strove to hide His pangs, with all a warrior's pride, Seem'd gathering courage to unfold Some fearful tale that must be told. At length his mien, his voice, obtain'd A calm, that seem'd by conflicts gain'd, As thus he spoke—“Yes! gaze a while On the bright scenes that round thee smile; For, if thy love be firm and true, Soon must thou bid their charms adieu! A fate hangs o'er us, whose decree Must bear me far from them or thee; Our path is one of snares and fear, I lose thee if I linger here! Droop not, beloved! thy home shall rise As fair, beneath far distant skies; As fondly tenderness and truth Shall cherish there thy rose of youth. But speak! and when yon hallow'd shrine Hath heard the vows which make thee mine, Say, wilt thou fly with me, no more To tread thine own loved mountain-shore, But share and soothe, repining not The bitterness of exile's lot?” “Ulric! thou know'st how dearly loved The scenes where first my childhood roved; The woods, the rocks, that tower supreme Above our own majestic stream, The halls where first my heart beat high To the proud songs of chivalry. All, all are dear—yet these are ties Affection well may sacrifice; Loved though they be, where'er thou art, There is the country of my heart! Yet, is there one, who, reft of me, Were lonely as a blasted tree; One, who still hoped my hand should close His eyes, in Nature's last repose; Eve gathers round him—on his brow Already rests the wintry snow; His form is bent, his features wear The deepening lines of age and care, His faded eye hath lost its fire; Thou wouldst not tear me from my sire? Yet tell me all—thy woes impart, My Ulric! to a faithful heart, Which sooner far—oh, doubt not this— Would share thy pangs, than others' bliss!” “Ella, what would'st thou?—'tis a tale Will make that cheek as marble pale! Yet what avails it to conceal All thou too soon must know and feel? It must, it must be told—prepare, And nerve that gentle heart to bear— But I—oh, was it then for me The herald of thy woes to be! Thy soul's bright calmness to destroy, And wake thee first from dreams of joy? Forgive!—I would not ruder tone Should make the fearful tidings known, I would not that unpitying eyes Should coldly watch thine agonies! Better 'twere mine—that task severe, To cloud thy breast with grief and fear. “Hast thou not heard, in legends old, Wild tales that turn the life-blood cold, Of those who meet in cave or glen, Far from the busy walks of men; Those who mysterious vigils keep, When earth is wrapt in shades and sleep, To judge of crimes, like Him on high, In stillness and in secresy? Th' unknown avengers, whose decree 'Tis fruitless to resist or flee? Whose name hath cast a spell of power, O'er peasant's cot and chieftain's tower? Thy sire—oh, Ella! hope is fled! Think of him, mourn him, as the dead! Their sentence, theirs, hath seal'd his doom, And thou may'st weep as o'er his tomb! Yes, weep!—relieve thy heart oppress'd, Pour forth thy sorrows on my breast! Thy cheek is cold—thy tearless eye Seems fix'd in frozen vacancy; Oh, gaze not thus!—thy silence break, Speak! if 'tis but in anguish, speak!” She spoke at length, in accents low, Of wild and half-indignant woe: —“He doom'd to perish! he decreed By their avenging arm to bleed! He, the renown'd in holy fight, The Paynim's scourge, the Christian's might! Ulric! what mean'st thou?—not a thought Of that high mind with guilt is fraught! Say, for which glorious trophy won, Which deed of martial prowess done; Which battle-field, in days gone by, Gain'd by his valour, must he die? Away! 'tis not his lofty name Their sentence hath consign'd to shame, 'Tis not his life they seek—recall Thy words, or say he shall not fall!” Then sprung forth tears, whose blest relief Gave pleading softness to her grief: “And wilt thou not, by all the ties Of our affianced love,” she cries, “By all my soul hath fix'd on thee, Of cherish'd hope for years to be, Wilt thou not aid him? wilt not thou Shield his grey head from danger now? And didst thou not, in childhood's morn, That saw our young affection born, Hang round his neck, and climb his knee, Sharing his parent-smile with me? Kind, gentle Ulric! best beloved! Now be thy faith in danger proved! Though snares and terrors round him wait, Thou wilt not leave him to his fate! Turn not away in cold disdain! —Shall thine own Ella plead in vain? How art thou changed! and must I bear That frown, that stern, averted air? What mean they?” “Maiden, need'st thou ask? These features wear no specious mask! Doth sorrow mark this brow and eye With characters of mystery? This—this is anguish!—can it be? And plead'st thou for thy sire to me? Know though thy prayers a death-pang give, He must not meet my sight—and live! Well may'st thou shudder!—of the band Who watch in secret o'er the land, Whose thousand swords 'tis vain to shun, Th' unknown, th' unslumbering—I am one! My arm defend him!—what were then Each vow that binds the souls of men, Sworn on the cross, and deeply seal'd By rites that may not be reveal'd? —A breeze's breath, an echo's tone, A passing sound, forgot when gone! Nay, shrink not from me—I would fly, That he by other hands may die! What! think'st thou I would live to trace Abhorrence in that angel-face? Beside thee should the lover stand, The father's life-blood on his brand? No! I have bade my home adieu, For other scenes mine eyes must view; Look on me, love! now all is known, O Ella! must I fly alone?” But she was changed; scarce heaved her breath; She stood like one prepared for death, And wept no more; then, casting down From her fair brows the nuptial crown, As joy's last vision from her heart, Cried, with sad firmness, “We must part! 'Tis past—these bridal flowers, so frail They may not brook one stormy gale, Survive—too dear as still thou art, Each hope they imaged—we must part! One struggle yet—and all is o'er— We love—and may we meet no more! Oh! little know'st thou of the power Affection lends in danger's hour, To deem that fate should thus divide My footsteps from a father's side! Speed thou to other shores—I go To share his wanderings and his woe; Where'er his path of thorns may lead, Whate'er his doom, by Heaven decreed, If there be guardian powers above, To nerve the heart of filial love; If courage may be won by prayer, Or strength by duty—I can bear! Farewell!—though in that sound be years Of blighted hopes and fruitless tears, Though the soul vibrate to its knell Of joys departed—yet, farewell!” Was this the maid who seem'd, erewhile, Born but to meet life's vernal smile? A being, almost on the wing, As an embodied breeze of spring? A child of beauty and of bliss, Sent from some purer sphere to this, Not, in her exile, to sustain The trial of one earthly pain; But, as a sunbeam, on to move, Wak'ning all hearts to joy and love? That airy form, with footsteps free, And radiant glance—could this be she? From her fair cheek the rose was gone, Her eye's blue sparkle thence had flown, Of all its vivid glow bereft, Each playful charm her lip had left; But what were these? on that young face, Far nobler beauty fill'd their place! 'Twas not the pride that scorns to bend, Though all the bolts of Heaven descend; Not the fierce grandeur of despair, That half exults its fate to dare; Nor that wild energy which leads Th' enthusiast to fanatic deeds; Her mien, by sorrow unsubdued, Was fix'd in silent fortitude; Not in its haughty strength elate, But calmly, mournfully sedate. 'Twas strange, yet lovely to behold That spirit in so fair a mould, As if a rose-tree's tender form, Unbent, unbroke, should meet the storm. One look she cast, where firmness strove. With the deep pangs of parting love; One tear a moment in her eye Dimm'd the pure light of constancy; And pressing, as to still her heart, She turn'd in silence to depart. But Ulric, as to frenzy wrought, Then started from his trance of thought: “Stay thee, oh, stay!—it must not be— All, all were well resign'd for thee! Stay! till my soul each vow disown, But those which make me thine alone. If there be guilt—there is no shrine More holy than that heart of thine; There be my crime absolved—I take The cup of shame for thy dear sake. Of shame! oh no! to virtue true, Where thou art, there is glory too! Go now! and to thy sire impart, He hath a shield in Ulric's heart, And thou a home!—remain, or flee, In life, in death—I follow thee!” “There shall not rest one cloud of shame, O Ulric! on thy lofty name; There shall not one accusing word Against thy spotless faith be heard! Thy path is where the brave rush on, Thy course must be where palms are won; Where banners wave, and falchions glare, Son of the mighty! be thou there! Think on the glorious names that shine Along thy sire's majestic line; Oh, last of that illustrious race! Thou wert not born to meet disgrace! Well, well I know each grief, each pain, Thy spirit nobly could sustain; E'en I unshrinking see them near, And what hast thou to do with fear? But when hath warriors calmly borne The cold and bitter smile of scorn? 'Tis not for thee—thy soul hath force To cope with all things—but remorse; And this my brightest thought shall be, Thou hast not braved its pangs for me. Go! break thou not one solemn vow; Closed be the fearful conflict now; Go! but forget not how my heart Still at thy name will proudly start, When chieftains hear, and minstrels tell, Thy deeds of glory—fare thee well!” And thus they parted—why recall The scene of anguish known to all? The burst of tears, the blush of pride, That fain those fruitless tears would hide; The lingering look, the last embrace, Oh! what avails it to retrace? They parted—in that bitter word A thousand tones of grief are heard, Whose deeply-seated echoes rest In the far cells of every breast; Who hath not known, who shall not know That keen, yet most familiar woe? Where'er affection's home is found, It meets her on the holy ground; The cloud of every summer hour, The canker-worm of every flower; Who but hath proved, or yet shall prove, That mortal agony of love? The autumn moon slept bright and still On fading wood and purple hill; The vintager had hush'd his lay, The fisher shunn'd the blaze of day, And silence, o'er each green recess, Brooded in misty sultriness. But soon a low and measured sound Broke on the deep repose around; From Lindheim's towers a glancing oar Bade the stream ripple to the shore. Sweet was that sound of waves which parted The fond, the true, the noble-hearted; And smoothly seem'd the bark to glide, And brightly flow'd the reckless tide, Though, mingling with its current, fell The last warm tears of love's farewell. Part II. Sweet is the gloom of forest shades, Their pillar'd walks and dim arcades, With all the thousand flowers that blow, A waste of loveliness, below. To him whose soul the world would fly, For Nature's lonely majesty: To bard, when wrapt in mighty themes, To lover, lost in fairy dreams, To hermit, whose prophetic thought By fits a gleam of heaven hath caught, And, in the visions of his rest, Held bright communion with the blest; 'Tis sweet, but solemn—there alike Silence and sound with awe can strike. The deep Eolian murmur made By sighing breeze and rustling shade, And cavern'd fountain gushing nigh, And wild-bee's plaintive lullaby, Or the dead stillness of the bowers, When dark the summer-tempest lowers; When silent Nature seems to wait The gathering Thunder's voice of fate, When the aspen scarcely waves in air, And the clouds collect for the lightning's glare, Each, each alike is awful there, And thrills the soul with feelings high, As some majestic harmony. But she, the maid, whose footsteps traced Each green retreat, in breathless haste, Young Ella linger'd not, to hear The wood-notes, lost on mourner's ear; The shivering leaf, the breeze's play, The fountain's gush, the wild-bird's lay; These charm not now—her sire she sought, With trembling frame, with anxious thought, And, starting, if a forest deer, But moved the rustling branches near, First felt that innocence may fear. She reach'd a lone and shadowy dell, Where the free sunbeam never fell; 'Twas twilight there at summer-noon, Deep night beneath the harvest-moon, And scarce might one bright star be seen Gleaming the tangled boughs between; For many a giant rock around, Dark, in terrific grandeur, frown'd, And the ancient oaks, that waved on high, Shut out each glimpse of the blessed sky. There the cold spring, in its shadowy cave, Ne'er to Heaven's beam one sparkle gave, And the wild-flower, on its brink that grew, Caught not from day one glowing hue. 'Twas said, some fearful deed untold, Had stain'd that scene in days of old; Tradition o'er the haunt had thrown A shade yet deeper than its own, And still, amidst th' umbrageous gloom, Perchance above some victim's tomb, O'ergrown with ivy and with moss, There stood a rudely-sculptured Cross, Which haply silent record bore, Of guilt and penitence of yore. Who by that holy sign was kneeling, With brow unutter'd pangs revealing, Hands clasp'd convulsively in prayer, And lifted eyes and streaming hair, And cheek, all pale as marble mould, Seen by the moonbeam's radiance cold? Was it some image of despair, Still fix'd that stamp of woe to bear? —Oh! ne'er could Art her forms have wrought, To speak such agonies of thought! Those death-like features gave to view A mortal's pangs, too deep and true! Starting he rose, with frenzied eye, As Ella's hurried step drew nigh; He turn'd, with aspect darkly wild, Trembling he stood—before his child! On, with a burst of tears, she sprung, And to her father's bosom clung. “Away! what seek'st thou here?” he cried, “Art thou not now thine Ulric's bride? Hence, leave me, leave me to await, In solitude, the storm of Fate; Thou know'st not what my doom may be Ere evening comes in peace to thee.” “My father! shall the joyous throng Swell high for me the bridal song? Shall the gay nuptial board be spread, The festal garland bind my head, And thou, in grief, in peril, roam, And make the wilderness thy home? No! I am here, with thee to share All suffering mortal strength may bear; And, oh! whate'er thy foes decree, In life, in death, in chains, or free; Well, well I feel, in thee secure, Thy heart and hand alike are pure!” Then was there meaning in his look. Which deep that trusting spirit shook; So wildly did each glance express The strife of shame and bitterness, As thus he spoke: “Fond dreams, oh hence! Is this the mien of Innocence? This furrow'd brow, this restless eye, Read thou this fearful tale—and fly! Is it enough? or must I seek For words, the tale of guilt to speak? Then be it so—I will not doom Thy youth to wither in its bloom; I will not see thy tender frame Bow'd to the earth with fear and shame. No! though I teach thee to abhor The sire, so fondly loved before; Though the dread effort rend my breast, Yet shalt thou leave me and be blest! Oh! bitter penance! thou wilt turn Away in horror and in scorn; Thy looks, that still through all the past Affection's gentlest beams have cast, As lightning on my heart will fall, And I must mark and bear it all! Yet though of life's best ties bereaved, Thou shalt not, must not be deceived! I linger—let me speed the tale, Ere voice, and thought, and memory fail. Why should I falter thus, to tell What Heaven so long hath known too well? Yes! though from mortal sight conceal'd, There hath a brother's blood appeal'd! He died—'twas not where banners wave, And war-steeds trample on the brave; He died—it was in Holy Land; Yet fell he not by Paynim hand; He sleeps not with his sires at rest, With trophied shield and knightly crest; Unknown his grave to kindred eyes, —But I can tell thee where he lies! It was a wild and savage spot, But once beheld—and ne'er forgot! I see it now—that haunted scene My spirit's dwelling still hath been; And he is there—I see him laid Beneath that palm-tree's lonely shade. The fountain-wave that sparkles nigh, Bears witness with its crimson dye! I see th' accusing glance he raised, Ere that dim eye by death was glazed; —Ne'er will that parting look forgive! I still behold it—and I live! I live! from hope, from mercy driven, A mark for all the shafts of Heaven! “Yet had I wrongs: by fraud he won My birth-right—and my child, my son, Heir to high name, high fortune born, Was doom'd to penury and scorn, An alien 'midst his fathers' halls, An exile from his native walls. Could I bear this?—the rankling thought, Deep, dark, within my bosom wrought; Some serpent, kindling hate and guile, Lurk'd in my infant's rosy smile, And when his accents lisp'd my name, They woke my inmost heart to flame! I struggled—are there evil powers That claim their own ascendant hours? —Oh! what should thine unspotted soul Or know or fear of their control? Why on the fearful conflict dwell? Vainly I struggled—and I fell: Cast down from every hope of bliss, Too well thou know'st to what abyss! “'Twas done—that moment hurried by To darken all eternity! Years roll'd away, long, evil years, Of woes, of fetters, and of fears; Nor aught but vain remorse I gain'd, By the deep guilt my soul which stain'd; For, long a captive in the lands Where Arabs tread their burning sands, The haunted midnight of the mind Was round me while in chains I pined, By all forgotten save by one Dread presence—which I could not shun. “How oft, when o'er the silent waste Nor path nor landmark might be traced, When slumbering by the watch-fire's ray, The Wanderers of the Desert lay, And stars, as o'er an ocean shone, Vigil I kept—but not alone! That form, that image from the dead, Still walk'd the wild with soundless tread! I've seen it in the fiery blast, I've seen it where the sand-storms pass'd; Beside the Desert's fount it stood, Tinging the clear cold wave with blood; And e'en when viewless, by the fear Curdling my veins, I knew 'twas near! —Was near!—I feel th' unearthly thrill, Its power is on my spirit still! A mystic influence, undefined, The spell, the shadow of my mind! “Wilt thou yet linger?—time speeds on; One last farewell, and then begone! Unclasp the hands that shade thy brow, And let me read thine aspect now! No! stay thee yet, and learn the meed Heaven's justice to my crime decreed. Slow came the day that broke my chain, But I at length was free again; And freedom brings a burst of joy, E'en guilt itself can scarce destroy. I thought upon my own fair towers, My native Rhine's gay vineyard bowers, And, in a father's visions, press'd Thee and thy brother to my breast. “'Twas but in visions—canst thou yet Recall the moment when we met? Thy step to greet me lightly sprung, Thy arms around me fondly clung; Scarce aught than infant-seraph less, Seem'd thy pure childhood's loveliness; But he was gone—that son, for whom I rush'd on guilt's eternal doom, He for whose sake alone were given My peace on earth, my hope in Heaven, He met me not.—A ruthless band, Whose name with terror fill'd the land, Fierce outlaws of the wood and wild Had reft the father of his child. Foes to my race, the hate they nursed, Full on that cherish'd scion burst. Unknown his fate.—No parent nigh, My boy! my first-born! didst thou die? Or did they spare thee for a life Of shame, of rapine, and of strife? Livest thou, unfriended, unallied, A wanderer, lost without a guide? Oh! to thy fate's mysterious gloom Blest were the darkness of the tomb! “Ella! 'tis done—my guilty heart Before thee all unveil'd—depart! Few pangs 'twill cost thee now to fly From one so stain'd, so lost as I; Yet peace to thine untainted breast, E'en though it hate me—be thou blest! Farewell! thou shalt not linger here; E'en now th' avenger may be near: Where'er I turn, the foe, the snare, The dagger, may be ambush'd there; One hour—and haply all is o'er, And we must meet on earth no more; No, nor beyond!—to those pure skies Where thou shalt be, I may not rise; Heaven's will for ever parts our lot, Yet, oh! my child! abhor me not! Speak once! to soothe this broken heart, Speak to me once! and then depart!” But still—as if each pulse were dead, Mute—as the power of speech were fled, Pale—as if life-blood ceased to warm The marble beauty of her form; On the dark rock she lean'd her head, That seem'd as there 'twere riveted, And dropt the hands, till then which press'd Her burning brow, or throbbing breast. There beam'd no tear-drop in her eye, And from her lip there breathed no sigh, And on her brow no trace there dwelt, That told she suffer'd or she felt. All that once glow'd, or smiled, or beam'd, Now fix'd, and quench'd, and frozen seem'd; And long her sire, in wild dismay, Deem'd her pure spirit pass'd away. But life return'd. O'er that cold frame One deep convulsive shudder came, And a faint light her eye relumed, And sad resolve her mien assumed; But there was horror in the gaze, Which yet to his she dared not raise, And her sad accents, wild and low, As rising from a depth of woe, At first with hurried trembling broke, But gather'd firmness as she spoke. “I leave thee not—whate'er betide, My footsteps shall not quit thy side; Pangs, keen as death my soul may thrill, But yet thou art my father still! And, oh! if stain'd by guilty deed, For some kind spirit, tenfold need, To speak of Heaven's absolving love, And waft desponding thought above. Is there not power in mercy's wave, The blood-stain from thy soul to lave? Is there not balm to heal despair, In tears, in penitence, in prayer? My father! kneel at His pure shrine Who died to expiate guilt like thine, Weep—and my tears with thine shall blend, Pray—while my prayers with thine ascend, And, as our mingling sorrows rise, Heaven will relent, though earth despise!” “My child, my child! these bursting tears, The first mine eyes have shed for years, Though deepest conflicts they express, Yet flow not all in bitterness! Oh! thou hast bid a wither'd heart From desolation's slumber start, Thy voice of pity and of love Seems o'er its icy depths to move E'en as a breeze of health, which brings Life, hope, and healing, on its wings. And there is mercy yet! I feel Its influence o'er my spirit steal; How welcome were each pang below, If guilt might be atoned by woe! Think'st thou I yet may be forgiven? Shall prayers unclose the gate of Heaven? Oh! if it yet avail to plead, If judgment be not yet decreed, Our hearts shall blend their suppliant cry, Till pardon shall be seal'd on high! Yet, yet I shrink!—will Mercy shed Her dews upon this fallen head? —Kneel, Ella, kneel! till full and free Descend forgiveness, won by thee!” They knelt:—before the Cross, that sign Of love eternal and divine; That symbol, which so long hath stood A rock of strength, on time's dark flood, Clasp'd by despairing hands and laved By the warm tears of nations saved; In one deep prayer their spirits blent, The guilty and the innocent; Youth, pure as if from Heaven its birth, Age, soil'd with every stain of earth, Knelt, offering up one heart, one cry, One sacrifice of agony. Oh! blest, though bitter be their source, Though dark the fountain of remorse, Blest are the tears which pour from thence, Th' atoning stream of penitence! And let not pity check the tide By which the heart is purified; Let not vain comfort turn its course Or timid love repress its force! Go! bind the flood, whose waves expand, To bear luxuriance o'er the land; Forbid the life-restoring rains To fall on Afric's burning plains; Close up the fount that gush'd to cheer The pilgrim o'er the waste who trode; But check thou not one holy tear, Which Penitence devotes to God! Through scenes so lone the wild-deer ne'er Was roused by huntsman's bugle there; So rude, that scarce might human eye Sustain their dread sublimity; So awful, that the timid swain, Nurtured amidst their dark domain, Had peopled, with unearthly forms, Their mists, their forests, and their storms; She, whose blue eye, of laughing light, Once made each festal scene more bright; Whose voice in song of joy was sweetest, Whose step in dance of mirth was fleetest. By torrent-wave, and mountain-brow, Is wandering as an outcast now, To share with Lindheim's fallen chief, His shame, his terror, and his grief. Hast thou not mark'd the ruin's flower, That blooms in solitary grace, And, faithful to its mouldering tower, Waves in the banner's place? From those grey haunts renown hath pass'd, Time wins his heritage at last; This day of glory hath gone by, With all its pomp and minstrelsy; Yet still the flower of golden hues There loves its fragrance to diffuse, To fallen and forsaken things With constancy unalter'd clings, And, smiling o'er the wreck of state, With beauty clothes the desolate. E'en such was she, the fair-hair'd maid, In all her light of youth array'd, Forsaking every joy below, To soothe a guilty parent's woe, And clinging thus, in beauty's prime, To the dark ruin made by crime. Oh! ne'er did Heaven's propitious eyes Smile on a purer sacrifice; Ne'er did young love, at duty's shrine, More nobly brighter hopes resign! O'er her own pangs she brooded not, Nor sunk beneath her bitter lot; No! that pure spirit's lofty worth Still rose more buoyantly from earth, And drew from an eternal source Its gentle, yet triumphant force; Roused by affliction's chastening might To energies more calmly bright, Like the wild harp of airy sigh, Woke by the storm to harmony! He that in mountain holds hath sought A refuge for unconquer'd thought, A charter'd home, where Freedom's child Might rear her altars in the wild, And fix her quenchless torch on high, A beacon for Eternity; Or they, whose martyr-spirits wage Proud war with Persecution's rage, And to the deserts bear the faith That bids them smile on chains and death; Well may they draw, from all around, Of grandeur clothed in form and sound, From the deep power of earth and sky, Wild nature's might of majesty, Strong energies, immortal fires, High hopes, magnificent desires! But dark, terrific, and austere, To him doth Nature's mien appear, Who, 'midst her wilds, would seek repose From guilty pangs and vengeful foes! For him the wind hath music dread, A dirge-like voice that mourns the dead; The forest's whisper breathes a tone, Appalling, as from worlds unknown; The mystic gloom of wood and cave Is fill'd with shadows of the grave; In noon's deep calm the sunbeams dart A blaze that seems to search his heart; The pure, eternal stars of night, Upbraid him with their silent light, And the dread spirit, which pervades, And hallows earth's most lonely shades, In every scene, in every hour, Surrounds him with chastising power, With nameless fear his soul to thrill, Heard, felt, acknowledged, present still! 'Twas the chilly close of an Autumn day, And the leaves fell thick o'er the wanderers' way, The rustling pines, with a hollow sound, Foretold the tempest gathering round, And the skirts of the western clouds were spread With a tinge of wild and stormy red, That seem'd, through the twilight forest bowers Like the glare of a city's blazing towers; But they, who far from cities fled, And shrunk from the print of human tread, Had reach'd a desert-scene unknown, So strangely wild, so deeply lone, That a nameless feeling, unconfess'd And undefined, their souls oppress'd. Rocks piled on rocks, around them hurl'd, Lay like the ruins of a world, Left by an earthquake's final throes In deep and desolate repose; Things of eternity whose forms Bore record of ten thousand storms! While, rearing its colossal crest In sullen grandeur o'er the rest, One, like a pillar, vast and rude, Stood monarch of the solitude. Perchance by Roman conqueror's hand Th' enduring monument was plann'd; Or Odin's sons, in days gone by, Had shaped its rough immensity, To rear, 'midst mountain, rock, and wood, A temple meet for rites of blood. But they were gone, who might have told That secret of the times of old, And there, in silent scorn it frown'd, O'er all its vast coevals round. Darkly those giant masses lower'd, Countless and motionless they tower'd; No wild-flower o'er their summits hung, No fountain from their caverns sprung; Yet ever on the wanderers' ear Murmur'd a sound of waters near, With music deep of lulling falls, And louder gush, at intervals. Unknown its source—nor spring nor stream Caught the red sunset's lingering gleam, But ceaseless, from its hidden caves, Arose that mystic voice of waves. Yet bosom'd 'midst that savage scene, One chosen spot of gentler mien Gave promise to the pilgrim's eye Of shelter from the tempest nigh. Glad sight! the ivied cross it bore, The sculptured saint that crown'd its door; Less welcome now were monarch's dome, Than that low cell, some hermit's home. Thither the outcasts bent their way, By the last lingering gleam of day, When from a cavern'd rock, which cast Deep shadows o'er them as they pass'd, A form, a warrior-form of might, As from earth's bosom, sprung to sight. His port was lofty—yet the heart Shrunk from him with recoiling start; His mien was youthful—yet his face Had nought of youth's ingenuous grace; Nor chivalrous, nor tender thought, Its traces on his brow had wrought; Yet dwelt no fierceness in his eye, But calm and cold severity, A spirit haughtily austere, Stranger to pity as to fear. It seem'd as pride had thrown a veil O'er that dark brow and visage pale, Leaving the searcher nought to guess, All was so fix'd and passionless. He spoke—and they who heard the tone Felt, deeply felt, all hope was flown. “I've sought thee far in forest bowers, I've sought thee long in peopled towers, I've borne the dagger of th' Unknown Through scenes explored by me alone; My search is closed—nor toils, nor fears, Repel the servant of the Seers; We meet—'tis vain to strive or fly, Albert of Lindheim—thou must die!” Then with clasp'd hands the fair-hair'd maid Sunk at his feet and wildly pray'd:— “Stay, stay thee! sheath that lifted steel! Oh! thou art human, and canst feel! Hear me! if e'er 'twas thine to prove The blessing of a parent's love; By thine own father's hoary hair, By her who gave thee being, spare! Did they not, o'er thy infant years, Keep watch, in sleepless hopes and fears! Young warrior! thou wilt heed my prayers, As thou would'st hope for grace to theirs!” But cold th' Avenger's look remain'd, His brow its rigid calm maintain'd: “Maiden! 'tis vain—my bosom ne'er Was conscious of a parent's care; The nurture of my infant years Froze in my soul the source of tears; 'Tis not for me to pause or melt, Or feel as happier hearts have felt. Away! the hour of fate goes by, Thy prayers are fruitless—he must die!” “Rise, Ella! rise,” with steadfast brow The father spoke; unshrinking now, As if from heaven a martyr's strength Had settled on his soul at length; “Kneel thou no more, my noble child, Thou by no taint of guilt defiled; Kneel not to man!—for mortal prayer, Oh! when did mortal vengeance spare? Since hope of earthly aid is flown, Lift thy pure hands to Heaven alone, And know, to calm thy suffering heart, My spirit is resign'd to part, Trusting in Him, who reads and knows This guilty breast, with all its woes. Rise! I would bless thee once again, Be still, be firm—for all is vain!” And she was still—she heard him not, Her prayers were hush'd—her pangs forgot; All thought, all memory pass'd away, Silent and motionless she lay, In a brief death, a blest suspense, Alike of agony and sense. She saw not when the dagger gleam'd In the last red light from the west that stream'd; She mark'd not when the life-blood's flow Came rushing to the mortal blow; While, unresisting, sunk her sire, Yet gather'd firmness to expire, Mingling a warrior's courage high, With a penitent's humility. And o'er him there th' Avenger stood, And watch'd the victim's ebbing blood, Still calm, as if his faithful hand Had but obey'd some just command, Some power, whose stern, yet righteous will, He deem'd it virtue to fulfil, And triumph'd, when the palm was won, For duty's task austerely done. But a feeling dread, and undefin'd, A mystic presage of the mind, With strange and sudden impulse ran Chill through the heart of the dying man, And his thoughts found voice, and his bosom breath, And it seem'd as fear suspended death, And Nature from her terrors drew Fresh energy, and vigour new. “Thou said'st thy lonely bosom ne'er Was conscious of a parent's care; Thou saidst thy lot, in childhood's years, Froze in thy soul the source of tears: The time will come, when thou, with me, The judgment-throne of God wilt see. Oh! by thy hopes of mercy, then, By His blest love who died for men, By each dread rite, and shrine, and vow, Avenger! I adjure thee now! To him who bleeds beneath thy steel, Thy lineage and thy name reveal, And haste thee! for his closing ear Hath little more on earth to hear— Haste! for the spirit, almost flown, Is lingering for thy words alone.” Then first a shade, resembling fear, Pass'd o'er th' Avenger's mien austere; A nameless awe his features cross'd, Soon in their haughty coldness lost. “What wouldst thou? Ask the rock and wild, And bid them tell thee of their child! Ask the rude winds, and angry skies, Whose tempests were his lullabies! His chambers were the cave and wood, His fosterers men of wrath and blood; Outcasts alike of earth and heaven, By wrongs to desperation driven! Who, in their pupil, now could trace The features of a nobler race? Yet such was mine!—if one who cast A look of anguish o'er the past, Bore faithful record on the day, When penitent in death he lay. But still deep shades my prospects veil, He died—and told but half the tale; With him it sleeps—I only know Enough for stern and silent woe, For vain ambition's deep regret, For hopes deceived, deceiving yet, For dreams of pride that vainly tell How high a lot had suited well The heir of some illustrious line, Heroes and chieftains of the Rhine!” Then swift through Albert's bosom pass'd One pang, the keenest and the last, Ere with his spirit fled the fears, The sorrows, and the pangs of years; And, while his grey hairs swept the dust, Faltering he murmur'd, “Heaven is just! For thee that deed of guilt was done, By thee avenged, my Son! my Son!” The day was closed—the moonbeam shed Light on the living and the dead, And as through rolling clouds it broke, Young Ella from her trance awoke— Awoke to bear, to feel, to know E'en more than all an orphan's woe. Oh! ne'er did moonbeam's light serene With beauty clothe a sadder scene! There, cold in death, the father slept, There, pale in woe, the daughter wept! Yes! she might weep—but one stood nigh, With horror in his tearless eye, That eye which ne'er again shall close In the deep quiet of repose; No more on earth beholding aught, Save one dread vision, stamp'd on thought. But, lost in grief, the Orphan Maid His deeper woe had scarce survey'd, Till his wild voice reveal'd a tale, Which seem'd to bid the Heavens turn pale! He call'd her, “Sister!” and the word In anguish breathed, in terror heard, Reveal'd enough—all else were weak, That sound a thousand pangs could speak. He knelt beside that breathless clay, Which, fix'd in utter stillness, lay— Knelt till his soul imbibed each trace, Each line of that unconscious face; Knelt, till his eye could bear no more, Those marble features to explore; Then, starting, turning, as to shun The image thus by Memory won, A wild farewell to her he bade, Who by the dead in silence pray'd, And, frenzied by his bitter doom, Fled thence—to find all earth a tomb! Days pass'd away—and Rhine's fair shore In the light of summer smiled once more; The vines were purpling on the hill, And the corn-fields waved in the sunshine still: There came a bark up the noble stream, With pennons that shed a golden gleam, With the flash of arms, and the voice of song, Gliding triumphantly along; For warrior-forms were glittering there, Whose plumes waved light in the whispering air; And as the tones of oar and wave Their measured cadence mingling gave, 'Twas thus th' exulting chorus rose, While many an echo swell'd the close:— From the fields where dead and dying, On their battle-bier are lying, Where the blood unstanch'd is gushing, Where the steed uncheck'd is rushing, Trampling o'er the noble-hearted, Ere the spirit yet be parted; Where each breath of Heaven is swaying Knightly plumes and banners playing, And the clarion's music swelling Calls the vulture from his dwelling; He comes, with trophies worthy of his line, The son of heroes, Ulric of the Rhine! To his own fair woods, enclosing Vales in sunny peace reposing, Where his native stream is laving Banks, with golden harvests waving, And the summer light is sleeping On the grape, through tendrils peeping; To the halls where harps are ringing, Bards the praise of warriors singing, Graceful footsteps bounding fleetly, Joyous voices mingling sweetly; Where the cheek of mirth is glowing, And the wine-cup brightly flowing, He comes, with trophies worthy of his line, The son of heroes, Ulric of the Rhine. He came—he sought his Ella's bowers, He traversed Lindheim's lonely towers; But voice and footstep thence had fled, As from the dwellings of the dead, And the sounds of human joy and woe Gave place to the moan of the wave below. The banner still the rampart crown'd, But the tall rank grass waved thick around; Still hung the arms of a race gone by, In the blazon'd halls of their ancestry But they caught no more, at fall of night, The wavering flash of the torch's light; And they sent their echoes forth no more, To the Minnesinger's tuneful lore, For the hands that touch'd the harp were gone, And the hearts were cold that loved its tone; And the soul of the chord lay mute and still, Save when the wild wind bade it thrill, And woke from its depths a dream-like moan, For life, and power, and beauty gone. The warrior turn'd from that silent scene, Where a voice of woe had welcome been, And his heart was heavy with boding thought, As the forest-paths alone he sought. He reach'd a convent's fane, that stood Deep bosom'd in luxuriant wood; Still, solemn, fair—it seem'd a spot Where earthly care might be all forgot, And sounds and dreams of Heaven alone, To musing spirit might be known. And sweet e'en then were the sounds that rose On the holy and profound repose. Oh! they came o'er the warrior's breast, Like a glorious anthem of the blest; And fear and sorrow died away, Before the full, majestic lay. He enter'd the secluded fane, Which sent forth that inspiring strain; He gazed—the hallow'd pile's array Was that of some high festal day; Wreaths of all hues its pillars bound, Flowers of all scents were strew'd around; The rose exhaled its fragrant sigh, Blest on the altar to smile and die; And a fragrant cloud from the censer's breath Half hid the sacred pomp beneath; And still the peal of choral song Swell'd the resounding aisles along; Wakening, in its triumphant flow, Deep echoes from the graves below. Why, from its woodland birthplace torn, Doth summer's rose that scene adorn? Why breathes the incense to the sky? Why swells th' exulting harmony? —And see'st thou not yon form, so light, It seems half floating on the sight, As if the whisper of a gale, That did but wave its snowy veil, Might bear it from the earth afar, A lovely, but receding star? Know, that devotion's shrine, e'en now, Receives that youthful vestal's vow, For this, high hymns, sweet odours rise, A jubilee of sacrifice! Mark yet a moment! from her brow Yon priest shall lift the veil of snow, Ere yet a darker mantle hide The charms to Heaven thus sanctified; Stay thee! and catch their parting gleam, That ne'er shall fade from memory's dream. A moment! oh! to Ulric's soul, Poised between hope and fear's control, What slow, unmeasured hours went by, Ere yet suspense grew certainty; It came at length—once more that face Reveal'd to man its mournful grace; A sunbeam on its features fell, As if to bear the world's farewell; And doubt was o'er—his heart grew chill— 'Twas she—though changed—'twas Ella still! Though now her once-rejoicing mien, Was deeply, mournfully serene; Though clouds her eye's blue lustre shaded, And the young cheek beneath had faded, Well, well he knew the form, which cast Light on his soul through all the past! 'Twas with him on the battle plain, 'Twas with him on the stormy main, 'Twas in his visions, when the shield Pillow'd his head on tented field; 'Twas a bright beam that led him on Where'er a triumph might be won, In danger as in glory nigh, An angel-guide to victory! She caught his pale bewilder'd gaze Of grief half lost in fix'd amaze— Was it some vain illusion, wrought By frenzy of impassion'd thought? Some phantom, such as Grief hath power To summon, in her wandering hour? No! it was he! the lost, the mourn'd, Too deeply loved, too late return'd! A fever'd blush, a sudden start, Spoke the last weakness of her heart, 'Twas vanquish'd soon—the hectic red A moment flush'd her cheek, and fled. Once more serene—her steadfast eye Look'd up as to Eternity; Then gaz'd on Ulric with an air, That said—the home of Love is there! Yes! there alone it smiled for him, Whose eye before that look grew dim; Not long 'twas his e'en thus to view The beauty of its calm adieu; Soon o'er those features, brightly pale, Was cast th' impenetrable veil; And, if one human sigh were given By the pure bosom vow'd to Heaven, 'Twas lost, as many a murmur'd sound Of grief, “not loud, but deep,” is drown'd, In hymns of joy, which proudly rise, To tell the calm untroubled skies, That earth hath banish'd care and woe, And man holds festivals below! SUPERSTITION AND REVELATION, AN UNFINISHED POEM. I Beings of brighter worlds! that rise at times As phantoms, with ideal beauty fraught, In those brief visions of celestial climes, Which pass, like sunbeams, o'er the realms of thought, Dwell ye around us?—are ye hovering nigh, Throned on the cloud, or buoyant in the air? And in deep solitudes, where human eye Can trace no step, Immortals! are ye there? Oh! who can tell?—what power, but Death alone Can lift the mystic veil that shades the world unknown? II But Earth hath seen the days, ere yet the flowers Of Eden wither'd, when reveal'd ye shone, In all your brightness, 'midst those holy bowers— Holy, but not unfading, as your own! While He, the child of that primeval soil, With you its paths in high communion trode, His glory yet undimm'd by guilt or toil, And beaming in the image of his God. And his pure spirit glowing from the sky, Exulting in its light, a spark of Deity. III Then, haply, mortal and celestial lays, Mingling their tones, from Nature's temple rose, When nought but that majestic song of praise Broke on the sanctity of night's repose, With music since unheard: and man might trace, By stream and vale, in deep embow'ring shade, Devotion's first and loveliest dwelling-place, The footsteps of th' Omnipotent, who made That spot a shrine, where youthful nature cast Her consecrated wealth, rejoicing as He pass'd. IV Short were those days, and soon, O sons of Heaven! Your aspect changed for man; in that dread hour, When from his paradise the alien driven, Beheld your forms in angry splendour tower, Guarding the clime where he no more might dwell, With meteor-swords: he saw the living flame, And his first cry of misery was—“Farewell!” His heart's first anguish, exile: he became A pilgrim on the earth, whose children's lot Is still for happier lands to pine—and reach them not. V Where now the chosen bowers that once beheld Delight and Love their first bright Sabbath keep? From all its founts the world of waters swell'd, And wrapt them in the mantle of the deep! For He, to whom the elements are slaves, In wrath unchain'd the oceans of the cloud, And heaved the abyss beneath; till waves on waves Folded creation in their mighty shroud, Then left the earth a solitude, o'erspread With its own awful wreck—a desert of the dead. VI But onward flow'd life's busy course again, And rolling ages with them bore away— As to be lost amidst the boundless main, Rich orient streams their golden sands convey— The hallow'd lore of old—the guiding light Left by tradition to the sons of earth, And the blest memory of each sacred rite, Known in the region of their father's birth, When in each breeze around his fair abode Whisper'd a seraph's voice, or lived the breath of God. VII Who hath not seen, what time the orb of day, Cinctured with glory, seeks the ocean's breast, A thousand clouds, all glowing in his ray, Catching brief splendour from the purple west? So round thy parting steps, fair Truth! awhile With borrow'd hues unnumber'd phantoms shone; And Superstition, from thy lingering smile, Caught a faint glow of beauty not her own, Blending her rites with thine—while yet afar Thine eye's last radiance beam'd, a slow-receding star. VIII Yet still one stream was pure—one sever'd shrine Was fed with holier fire, by chosen hands, And sounds, and dreams, and impulses divine, Were in the dwellings of the patriarch bands. There still the father to his child bequeath'd The sacred torch of never-dying flame; There still Devotion's suppliant accents breathed The One adored and everlasting Name, And angel guests would linger and repose Where those primeval tents amid their palm-trees rose. IX But far o'er earth the apostate wanderers bore Their alien rites:—for them, by fount or shade, Nor voice, nor vision, holy as of yore, In thrilling whispers to the soul convey'd High inspiration: yet in every clime, Those sons of doubt and error fondly sought With beings, in their essence more sublime, To hold communion of mysterious thought; On some dread power in trembling hope to lean, And hear in every wind the accents of th' Unseen. X Yes! we have need to bid our hopes repose On some protecting influence; here confined, Life hath no healing balm for mortal woes, Earth is too narrow for th' immortal mind. Our spirits burn to mingle with the day, As exiles panting for their native coast, Yet lured by every wild-flower from their way, And shrinking from the gulf that must be cross'd; Death hovers round us—in the zephyr's sigh, As in the storm, he comes—and lo! Eternity! XI As one left lonely on the desert sands Of burning Afric, where, without a guide, He gazes as the pathless waste expands— Around, beyond, interminably wide; While the red haze, presaging the Simoom, Obscures the fierce resplendence of the sky, Or suns of blasting light perchance illume The glistening Serab Serab, mirage. which illudes his eye; Such was the wanderer Man, in ages flown, Kneeling in doubt and fear before the dread Unknown. XII His thoughts explored the past—and where were they, The chiefs of men, the mighty ones gone by? He turn'd—a boundless void before him lay, Wrapp'd in the shadows of futurity. How knew the child of Nature that the flame He felt within him, struggling to ascend, Should perish not with that terrestrial frame Doom'd with the earth on which it moved, to blend? How, when affliction bade his spirit bleed, If 'twere a Father's love or Tyrant's wrath decreed? XIII Oh! marvel not, if then he sought to trace In all sublimities of sight and sound, In rushing winds that wander through all space, Or 'midst deep woods, with holy gloom embrown'd, The oracles of Fate! or if the train Of floating forms, that throng the world of sleep, And sounds that vibrate on the slumberer's brain, When mortal voices rest in stillness deep, Were deem'd mysterious revelations, sent From viewless powers, the lords of each dread element. XIV Was not wild Nature, in that elder-time, Clothed with a deeper power?—earth's wandering race, Exploring realms of solitude sublime, Not as we see, beheld her awful face! Art had not tamed the mighty scenes which met Their searching eyes; unpeopled kingdoms lay In savage pomp before them—all was yet Silent and vast, but not as in decay, And the bright daystar, from his burning throne, Look'd o'er a thousand shores, untrodden, voiceless, lone. XV The forests in their dark luxuriance waved, With all their swell of strange Æolian sound; The fearful deep, sole region ne'er enslaved, Heaved, in its pomp of terror, darkly round; Then, brooding o'er the images, imprest By forms of grandeur thronging on his eye, And faint traditions, guarded in his breast, 'Midst dim remembrances of infancy, Man shaped unearthly presences, in dreams, Peopling each wilder haunt of mountains, groves, and streams. XVI Then bled the victim—then in every shade Of rock or turf arose the votive shrine; Fear bow'd before the phantoms she portray'd, And Nature teem'd with many a mystic sign. Meteors, and storms, and thunders! ye whose course E'en yet is awful to th' enlighten'd eye, As, wildly rushing from your secret source, Your sounding chariot sweeps the realms on high, Then o'er the earth prophetic gloom ye cast, And the wide nations gazed, and trembled as ye pass'd. XVII But you, ye stars! in distant glory burning, Nurtured with flame, bright altars of the sky! To whose far climes the spirit, vainly turning, Would pierce the secrets of infinity— To you the heart, bereft of other light, Its first deep homage paid, on Eastern plains, Where Day hath terrors, but majestic Night, Calm in her pomp, magnificently reigns, Cloudless and silent, circled with the race Of some unnumber'd orbs, that light the depths of space. XVIII Shine on! and brightly plead for erring thought, Whose wing, unaided in its course, explored The wide creation, and beholding nought Like your eternal beauty, then adored Its living splendours; deeming them inform'd By natures temper'd with a holier fire— Pure beings, with ethereal effluence warm'd, Who to the source of spirit might aspire, And mortal prayers benignantly convey To some presiding Power, more awful far than they. XIX Guides o'er the desert and the deep! to you The seaman turn'd, rejoicing at the helm, When from the regions of empyreal blue Ye pour'd soft radiance o'er the ocean-realm; To you the dweller of the plains address'd Vain prayers, that called the clouds and dews your own; To you the shepherd, on the mountain's crest, Kindled the fires that far through midnight shone, As earth would light up all her hills, to vie With your immortal host, and image back the sky. XX Hail to the queen of heaven! her silvery crown Serenely wearing, o'er her high domain She walks in brightness, looking cloudless down, As if to smile on her terrestrial reign. Earth should be hush'd in slumber—but the night Calls forth her worshippers; the feast is spread, On hoary Lebanon's umbrageous height The shrine is raised, the rich libation shed To her, whose beams illume those cedar-shades Faintly as Nature's light the 'wilder'd soul pervades. XXI But when thine orb, all earth's rich hues restoring, Came forth, O sun! in majesty supreme, Still from thy pure exhaustless fountain, pouring Beauty and life in each triumphant beam, Through thine own east what joyous rites prevail'd! What choral songs re-echo'd! while thy fire Shone o'er its thousand altars, and exhaled The precious incense of each odorous pyre, Heap'd with the richest balms of spicy vales, And aromatic woods that scent the Arabian gales. XXII Yet not with Saba's fragrant wealth alone, Balsam and myrrh, the votive pile was strew'd; For the dark children of the burning zone Drew frenzy from thy fervors, and bedew'd With their own blood thy shrine; while that wild scene, Haply with pitying eye, thine angel view'd, And, though with glory mantled, and serene In his own fulness of beatitude, Yet mourn'd for those whose spirits from thy ray Caught not one transient spark of intellectual day. XXIII But earth had deeper stains: ethereal powers! Benignant seraphs! wont to leave the skies, And hold high converse, 'midst his native bowers, With the once-glorious son of Paradise, Look'd ye from heaven in sadness? were your strains Of choral praise suspended in dismay, When the polluted shrine of Syria's plains, With clouds of incense dimm'd the blaze of day? Or did ye veil indignantly your eyes, While demons hail'd the pomp of human sacrifice? XXIV And well the powers of evil might rejoice, When rose from Tophet's vale the exulting cry, And, deaf to Nature's supplicating voice, The frantic mother bore her child to die! Around her vainly clung his feeble hands With sacred instinct: love hath lost its sway, While ruthless zeal the sacrifice demands, And the fires blaze, impatient for their prey. Let not his shrieks reveal the dreadful tale! Well may the drum's loud peal o'erpower an infant's wail! XXV A voice of sorrow! not from thence it rose; 'Twas not the childless mother—Syrian maids, Where with red wave the mountain streamlet flows, Keep tearful vigil in their native shades. With dirge and plaint the cedar-groves resound, Each rock's deep echo for Adonis mourns: Weep for the dead!—away! the lost is found, To life and love the buried god returns! Then wakes the timbrel—then the forests ring, And shouts of frenzied joy are on each breeze's wing! XXVI But fill'd with holier joy the Persian stood, In silent reverence, on the mountain's brow, At early dayspring, while the expanding flood Of radiance burst around, above, below— Bright, boundless as eternity: he gazed Till his full soul, imbibing heaven, o'erflow'd In worship of th' Invisible, and praised In thee, O Sun! the symbol and abode Of life, and power, and excellence; the throne Where dwelt the Unapproach'd, resplendently alone. At an earlier stage in the composition of this poem, the following stanza was here inserted:— ‘Nor rose the Magian's hymn, sublimely swelling In full-toned homage to the source of flame, From fabric rear'd by man—the gorgeous dwelling Of such bright idol-forms as art could frame; He rear'd no temple, bade no walls contain The breath of incense, or the voice of prayer; But made the boundless universe his fane, The rocks his altar-stone, adoring there The Being whose Omnipotence pervades All deserts and all depths, and hallows loneliest shades.’ XXVII What if his thoughts, with erring fondness, gave Mysterious sanctity to things which wear Th' Eternal's impress?—if the living wave, The circling heavens, the free and boundless air— If the pure founts of everlasting flame, Deep in his country's hallow'd vales enshrined, And the bright stars maintain'd a silent claim To love and homage from his awestruck mind? Still with his spirit dwelt a lofty dream Of uncreated Power, far, far o'er these supreme. XXVIII And with that faith was conquest. He whose name To Judah's harp of prophecy had rung; He, of whose yet unborn and distant fame The mighty voice of Inspiration sung, He came, the victor Cyrus!—as he pass'd, Thrones to his footstep rock'd, and monarchs lay Suppliant and clothed with dust; while nations cast Their ancient idols down before his way, Who, in majestic march, from shore to shore, The quenchless flame revered by Persia's children bore. THE CARAVAN IN THE DESERTS. Call it not loneliness, to dwell In woodland shade or hermit dell, Or the deep forest to explore, Or wander Alpine regions o'er; For Nature there all joyous reigns, And fills with life her wild domains: A bird's light wing may break the air, A wave, a leaf, may murmur there: A bee the mountain flowers may seek, A chamois bound from peak to peak; An eagle, rushing to the sky, Wake the deep echoes with his cry; And still some sound, thy heart to cheer, Some voice, though not of man is near. But he, whose weary step hath traced Mysterious Afric's awful waste— Whose eye Arabia's wilds hath view'd, Can tell thee what is solitude! It is, to traverse lifeless plains, Where everlasting stillness reigns, And billowy sands and dazzling sky, Seem boundless as infinity! It is, to sink, with speechless dread, In scenes unmeet for mortal tread, Sever'd from earthly being's trace, Alone, amidst eternal space! 'Tis noon—and fearfully profound, Silence is on the desert round; Alone she reigns, above, beneath, With all the attributes of death! No bird the blazing heaven may dare, No insect bide the scorching air; The ostrich, though of sun-born race, Seeks a more shelter'd dwelling-place; The lion slumbers in his lair, The serpent shuns the noontide glare: But slowly wind the patient train Of camels o'er the blasted plain, Where they and man may brave alone The terrors of the burning zone. Faint not, O pilgrims! though on high, As a volcano, flame the sky; Shrink not, though as a furnace glow The dark-red seas of sand below; Though not a shadow save your own, Across the dread expanse is thrown; Mark! where your feverish lips to lave, Wide spreads the fresh transparent wave! Urge your tired camels on, and take Your rest beside yon glistening lake; Thence, haply, cooler gales may spring, And fan your brows with lighter wing. Lo! nearer now, its glassy tide, Reflects the date-tree on its side— Speed on! pure draughts and genial air, And verdant shade, await you there. Oh glimpse of Heaven! to him unknown, That hath not trod the burning zone! Forward they press—they gaze dismay'd— The waters of the desert fade! Melting to vapours that elude The eye, the lip, they vainly woo'd. The mirage, or vapour assuming the appearance of water. What meteor comes?—a purple haze Hath half obscured the noontide rays: See the description of the Simoom in Bruce's Travels. Onward it moves in swift career, A blush upon the atmosphere; Haste, haste! avert th' impending doom, Fall prostrate! 'tis the dread Simoom! Bow down your faces—till the blast On its red wing of flame hath pass'd, Far bearing o'er the sandy wave, The viewless Angel of the Grave. It came—'tis vanish'd—but hath left The wanderers e'en of hope bereft; The ardent heart, the vigorous frame, Pride, courage, strength, its power could tame Faint with despondence, worn with toil, They sink upon the burning soil, Resign'd, amidst those realms of gloom, To find their deathbed and their tomb. The extreme languor and despondence produced by the Simoom, even when its effects are not fatal, have been described by many travellers. But onward still!—yon distant spot Of verdure can deceive you not; Yon palms, which tremulously seem'd Reflected as the waters gleam'd, Along th' horizon's verge display'd, Still rear their slender colonnade— A landmark, guiding o'er the plain The Caravan's exhausted train. Fair is that little Isle of Bliss The desert's emerald oasis! A rainbow on the torrent's wave, A gem embosom'd in the grave, A sunbeam on a stormy day Its beauty's image might convey! ‘Beauty, in horror's lap that sleeps, While silence round her vigil keeps. —Rest, weary pilgrims! calmly laid To slumber in th' acacia shade: Rest, where the shrubs your camels bruise, Their aromatic breath diffuse; Where softer light the sunbeams pour Through the tall palm and sycamore; And the rich date luxuriant spreads Its pendant clusters o'er your heads. Nature once more, to seal your eyes, Murmurs her sweetest lullabies; Again each heart the music hails Of rustling leaves and sighing gales, And oh! to Afric's child how dear The voice of fountains gushing near! Sweet be your slumbers! and your dreams Of waving groves and rippling streams! Far be the serpent's venom'd coil From the brief respite won by toil; Far be the awful shades of those Who deep beneath the sands repose— The hosts, to whom the desert's breath Bore swift and stern the call of death. Sleep! nor may scorching blast invade The freshness of the acacia shade, But gales of heaven your spirits bless, With life's best balm—Forgetfulness! Till night from many an urn diffuse The treasures of her world of dews. The day hath closed—the moon on high Walks in her cloudless majesty. A thousand stars to Afric's heaven Serene magnificence have given; Pure beacons of the sky, whose flame Shines forth eternally the same. Blest be their beams, whose holy light Shall guide the camel's footsteps right, And lead, as with a track divine, The pilgrim to his prophet's shrine! —Rise! bid your Isle of Palms adieu! Again your lonely march pursue, While airs of night are freshly blowing, And heavens with softer beauty glowing. —Tis silence all: the solemn scene Wears, at each step, a ruder mien; For giant-rocks, at distance piled, Cast their deep shadows o'er the wild. Darkly they rise—what eye hath view'd The caverns of their solitude? Away! within those awful cells The savage lord of Afric dwells! Heard ye his voice?—the lion's roar Swells as when billows break on shore. Well may the camel shake with fear, And the steed pant—his foe is near; Haste! light the torch, bid watchfires throw, Far o'er the waste, a ruddy glow; Keep vigil—guard the bright array, Of flames that scare him from his prey; Within their magic circle press, O wanderers of the wilderness! Heap high the pile, and by its blaze Tell the wild tales of elder days. Arabia's wond'rous lore—that dwells On warrior deeds, and wizard spells; Enchanted domes, 'mid scenes like these, Rising to vanish with the breeze; Gardens, whose fruits are gems, that shed Their light where mortal may not tread, And spirits, o'er whose pearly halls Th' eternal billow heaves and falls. —With charms like these, of mystic power, Watchers! beguile the midnight hour. —Slowly that hour hath roll'd away, And star by star withdraws its ray. Dark children of the sun! again Your own rich orient hails his reign. He comes, but veil'd—with sanguine glare Tinging the mists that load the air; Sounds of dismay, and signs of flame, Th' approaching hurricane proclaim. 'Tis death's red banner streams on high— Fly to the rocks for shelter!—fly! Lo! dark'ning o'er the fiery skies, The pillars of the desert rise! On, in terrific grandeur wheeling, A giant-host, the heavens concealing, They move, like mighty genii forms, Towering immense 'midst clouds and storms. Who shall escape?—with awful force The whirlwind bears them on their course; They join, they rush resistless on, The landmarks of the plain are gone; The steps, the forms, from earth effaced, Of those who trod the burning waste! All whelm'd, all hush'd!—none left to bear Sad record how they perish'd there! No stone their tale of death shall tell— The desert guards its mysteries well; And o'er th' unfathom'd sandy deep, Where low their nameless relics sleep, Oft shall the future pilgrim tread, Nor know his steps are on the dead. MARIUS AMONGST THE RUINS OF CARTHAGE. 'Twas noon, and Afric's dazzling sun on high, With fierce resplendence fill'd th' unclouded sky; No zephyr waved the palm's majestic head, And smooth alike the seas and deserts spread; While desolate, beneath a blaze of light, Silent and lonely as at dead of night, The wreck of Carthage lay. Her prostrate fanes Had strew'd their precious marble o'er the plains; Dark weeds and grass the column had o'ergrown, The lizard bask'd upon the altar-stone; Whelm'd by the ruins of their own abodes, Had sunk the forms of heroes and of gods; While near, dread offspring of the burning day! Coil'd 'midst forsaken halls, the serpent lay. There came an exile, long by fate pursued, To shelter in that awful solitude. Well did that wanderer's high yet faded mien, Suit the sad grandeur of the desert-scene; Shadow'd, not veil'd, by locks of wintry snow, Pride sat, still mighty, on his furrow'd brow; Time had not quench'd the terrors of his eye, Nor tamed his glance of fierce ascendency; While the deep meaning of his features told, Ages of thought had o'er his spirit roll'd, Nor dimm'd the fire that might not be controll'd; And still did power invest his stately form, Shatter'd, but yet unconquer'd, by the storm. But slow his step—and where, not yet o'erthrown, Still tower'd a pillar 'midst the waste alone, Faint with long toil, his weary limbs he laid, To slumber in its solitary shade. He slept—and darkly, on his brief repose, Th' indignant genius of the scene arose. Clouds robed his dim unearthly form, and spread Mysterious gloom around his crownless head, Crownless, but regal still. With stern disdain, The kingly shadow seem'd to lift his chain, Gazed on the palm, his ancient sceptre torn, And his eye kindled with immortal scorn! “And sleep'st thou, Roman?” cry'd his voice austere; “Shall son of Latium find a refuge here? Awake! arise! to speed the hour of Fate, When Rome shall fall, as Carthage desolate! Go! with her children's flower, the free, the brave, People the silent chambers of the grave; So shall the course of ages yet to be, More swiftly waft the day, avenging me! “Yes, from the awful gulf of years to come, I hear a voice that prophesies her doom; I see the trophies of her pride decay, And her long line of triumphs pass away, Lost in the depths of time—while sinks the star That led her march of heroes from afar! Lo! from the frozen forests of the north, The sons of slaughter pour in myriads forth! Who shall awake the mighty?—will thy woe, City of thrones! disturb the realms below? Call on the dead to hear thee! let thy cries Summon their shadowy legions to arise, Array the ghosts of conquerors on thy walls! —Barbarians revel in their ancient halls, And their lost children bend the subject knee, 'Midst the proud tombs and trophies of the free. Bird of the sun! dread eagle! borne on high, A creature of the empyreal—Thou, whose eye Was lightning to the earth—whose pinion waved In haughty triumph o'er a world enslaved; Sink from thy Heavens! for glory's noon is o'er, And rushing storms shall bear thee on no more! Closed is thy regal course—thy crest is torn, And thy plume banish'd from the realms of morn. The shaft hath reach'd thee!—rest with chiefs and kings, Who conquer'd in the shadow of thy wings; Sleep! while thy foes exult around their prey, And share thy glorious heritage of day! “But darker years shall mingle with the past, And deeper vengeance shall be mine at last. O'er the seven hills I see destruction spread, And Empire's widow veils with dust her head! Her gods forsake each desolated shrine, Her temples moulder to the earth, like mine: 'Midst fallen palaces she sits alone, Calling heroic shades from ages gone, Or bids the nations 'midst her deserts wait To learn the fearful oracles of Fate! “Still sleep'st thou, Roman? Son of Victory, rise! Wake to obey th' avenging Destinies! Shed by thy mandate, soon thy country's blood Shall swell and darken Tiber's yellow flood! My children's manès call—awake! prepare The feast they claim!—exult in Rome's despair! Be thine ear closed against her suppliant cries, Bid thy soul triumph in her agonies; Let carnage revel, e'en her shrines among, Spare not the valiant, pity not the young! Haste! o'er her hills the sword's libation shed, And wreak the curse of Carthage on her head!” The vision flies—a mortal step is near, Whose echoes vibrate on the slumberer's ear; He starts, he wakes to woe—before him stands Th' unwelcome messenger of harsh commands, Whose falt'ring accents tell the exiled chief, To seek on other shores a home for grief. —Silent the wanderer sat—but on his cheek The burning glow far more than words might speak; And, from the kindling of his eye, there broke Language, where all th' indignant soul awoke, Till his deep thought found voice—then, calmly stern, And sovereign in despair, he cried, “Return! Tell him who sent thee hither, thou hast seen Marius, the exile, rest where Carthage once hath been!” SONG. FOUNDED ON AN ARABIAN ANECDOTE. Away! though still thy sword is red With life-blood from my sire, No drop of thine may now be shed To quench my bosom's fire; Though on my heart 'twould fall more blest, Than dews upon the desert's breast. I've sought thee 'midst the sons of men, Through the wide city's fanes; I've sought thee by the lion's den, O'er pathless, boundless plains; No step that mark'd the burning waste, But mine its lonely course hath traced. Thy name hath been a baleful spell, O'er my dark spirit cast; No thought may dream, no words may tell, What there unseen hath pass'd: This wither'd cheek, this faded eye, Are seals of thee—behold! and fly! Hath not my cup for thee been pour'd, Beneath the palm-tree's shade? Hath not soft sleep thy frame restored, Within my dwelling laid? What though unknown—yet who shall rest Secure—if not the Arab's guest? Haste thee! and leave my threshold-floor, Inviolate and pure! Let not thy presence tempt me more, —Man may not thus endure! Away! I bear a fetter'd arm, A heart that burns—but must not harm! Begone! outstrip the swift gazelle! The wind in speed subdue! Fear cannot fly so swift, so well, As vengeance shall pursue; And hate, like love, in parting pain, Smiles o'er one hope—we meet again! To-morrow—and th' avenger's hand, The warrior's dart is free! E'en now, no spot in all thy land, Save this, had shelter'd thee, Let blood the monarch's hall profane,— The Arab's tent must bear no stain! Fly! may the desert's fiery blast Avoid thy secret way! And sternly, till thy steps be past, Its whirlwinds sleep to-day! I would not that thy doom should be Assign'd by Heaven to aught but me. THE CROSS OF THE SOUTH. In the silence and grandeur of midnight I tread, Where savannahs, in boundless magnificence, spread, And bearing sublimely their snow-wreaths on high, The far Cordilleras unite with the sky. The fir-tree waves o'er me, the fire-flies' red light With its quick-glancing splendour illumines the night; And I read in each tint of the skies and the earth, How distant my steps from the land of my birth. But to thee, as thy lode-stars resplendently burn In their clear depths of blue, with devotion I turn, Bright Cross of the South! and beholding thee shine, Scarce regret the loved land of the olive and vine. Thou recallest the ages when first o'er the main My fathers unfolded the ensign of Spain, And planted their faith in the regions that see Its unperishing symbol emblazon'd in thee. How oft in their course o'er the oceans unknown, Where all was mysterious, and awful, and lone, Hath their spirit been cheer'd by thy light, when the deep Reflected its brilliance in tremulous sleep! As the vision that rose to the Lord of the world, Constantine. When first his bright banner of faith was unfurl'd; Even such, to the heroes of Spain, when their prow Made the billows the path of their glory, wert thou. And to me, as I traversed the world of the west, Through deserts of beauty in stillness that rest; By forests and rivers untamed in their pride, Thy hues have a language, thy course is a guide. Shine on—my own land is a far distant spot, And the stars of thy sphere can enlighten it not; And the eyes that I love, though e'en now they may be O'er the firmament wandering, can gaze not on thee! But thou to my thoughts art a pure-blazing shrine. A fount of bright hopes, and of visions divine; And my soul, as an eagle exulting and free, Soars high o'er the Andes to mingle with thee. THE SLEEPER OF MARATHON. I lay upon the solemn plain, And by the funeral mound, Where those who died not there in vain, Their place of sleep had found. 'Twas silent where the free blood gush'd, When Persia came array'd— So many a voice had there been hush'd, So many a footstep stay'd. I slumber'd on the lonely spot So sanctified by death: I slumber'd—but my rest was not As theirs who lay beneath. For on my dreams, that shadowy hour, They rose—the chainless dead— All arm'd they sprang, in joy, in power, Up from their grassy bed. I saw their spears, on that red field, Flash as in time gone by— Chased to the seas without his shield, I saw the Persian fly. I woke—the sudden trumpet's blast Call'd to another fight— From visions of our glorious past, Who doth not wake in might? TO MISS F. A. L. ON HER BIRTHDAY. What wish can Friendship form for thee What brighter star invoke to shine?— Thy path from every thorn is free, And every rose is thine! Life hath no purer joy in store, Time hath no sorrow to efface; Hope cannot paint one blessing more Than memory can retrace! Some hearts a boding fear might own, Had Fate to them thy portion given, Since many an eye by tears alone, Is taught to gaze on Heaven! And there are virtues oft conceal'd, Till roused by anguish from repose, As odorous trees no balm will yield, Till from their wounds it flows. But fear not thou the lesson fraught With Sorrow's chast'ning power to know; Thou need'st not thus be sternly taught, “To melt at others' woe.” Then still, with heart as blest, as warm, Rejoice thou in thy lot on earth: Ah! why should Virtue dread the storm, If sunbeams prove her worth? WRITTEN IN THE FIRST LEAF OF THE ALBUM OF THE SAME. What first should consecrate as thine, The volume, destined to be fraught With many a sweet and playful line, With many a pure and pious thought? It should be, what a loftier strain Perchance less meetly would impart; What never yet was pour'd in vain,— The blessing of a grateful heart— For kindness, which hath soothed the hour Of anxious grief, of weary pain, And oft, with its beguiling power, Taught languid Hope to smile again; Long shall that fervent blessing rest On thee and thine, and heavenwards borne, Call down such peace to soothe thy breast, As thou would'st bear to all that mourn. TO THE SAME—ON THE DEATH OF HER MOTHER. Say not 'tis fruitless, nature's holy tear, Shed by affection o'er a parent's bier! More blest than dew on Hermon's brow that falls, Each drop to life some latent virtue calls; Awakes some purer hope, ordain'd to rise, By earthly sorrow strengthen'd for the skies, Till the sad heart, whose pangs exalt its love, With its lost treasure, seeks a home—above. But grief will claim her hour,—and He, whose eye Looks pitying down on nature's agony, He, in whose love the righteous calmly sleep, Who bids us hope, forbids us not to weep! He, too, hath wept—and sacred be the woes Once borne by him, their inmost source who knows, Searches each wound, and bids His Spirit bring Celestial healing on its dove-like wing! And who but He shall soothe, when one dread stroke, Ties, that were fibres of the soul, hath broke? Oh! well may those, yet lingering here, deplore The vanish'd light, that cheers their path no more! Th' Almighty hand, which many a blessing dealt, Sends its keen arrows not to be unfelt! By fire and storm, Heaven tries the Christian's worth, And joy departs, to wean us from the earth, Where still too long, with beings born to die, Time hath dominion o'er Eternity. Yet not the less, o'er all the heart hath lost, Shall Faith rejoice, when Nature grieves the most; Then comes her triumph! through the shadowy gloom, Her star in glory rises from the tomb, Mounts to the day-spring, leaves the cloud below, And gilds the tears that cease not yet to flow! Yes, all is o'er! fear, doubt, suspense are fled, Let brighter thoughts be with the virtuous dead! The final ordeal of the soul is past, And the pale brow is seal'd to Heaven at last! “Till we have sealed the servants of God in their foreheads.”—Revelations. And thou, loved spirit! for the skies mature, Steadfast in faith, in meek devotion pure; Thou that didst make the home thy presence blest, Bright with the sunshine of thy gentle breast, Where peace a holy dwelling-place had found, Whence beam'd her smile benignantly around; Thou, that to bosoms widow'd and bereft Dear, precious records of thy worth hast left, The treasured gem of sorrowing hearts to be, Till Heaven recall surviving love to thee!— O cherish'd and revered! fond memory well On thee, with sacred, sad delight, may dwell! So pure, so blest thy life, that death alone Could make more perfect happiness thine own; He came—thy cup of joy, serenely bright, Full to the last, still flow'd in cloudless light; He came—an angel, bearing from on high The all it wanted—Immortality! FROM THE ITALIAN OF GARCILASSO DE LA VEGA. Divine Eliza!—since the sapphire sky Thou measur'st now on angel wings, and feet Sandall'd with immortality—oh why Of me forgetful!—Wherefore not entreat To hurry on the time when I shall see The veil of mortal being rent in twain, And smile that I am free? In the third circle of that happy land Shall we not seek together, hand in hand, Another lovelier landscape, a new plain, Other romantic streams and mountains blue, And other vales, and a new shady shore, When I may rest, and ever in my view Keep thee, without the terror and surprise Of being sunder'd more! FROM THE ITALIAN OF SANNAZARO. Oh! pure and blessed soul That, from thy clay's control Escaped, hast sought and found thy native sphere, And from thy crystal throne Look'st down, with smiles alone, On this vain scene of mortal hope and fear; Thy happy feet have trod The starry spangled road, Celestial flocks by field and fountain guiding, And from their erring track Thou charm'st thy shepherds back, With the soft music of thy gentle chiding, O! who shall Death withstand— Death, whose impartial hand Levels the lowest plant and loftiest pine! When shall our ears again Drink in so sweet a strain, Our eyes behold so fair a form as thine! A DIRGE. Weep for the early lost!— How many flowers were mingled in the crown Thus, with the lovely, to the grave gone down, E'en when life promised most, How many hopes have wither'd—they that bow To Heaven's dread will, feel all its mysteries now. Did the young mother's eye, Behold her child, and close upon the day, Ere from its glance th' awakening spirit's ray In sunshine could reply? —Then look for clouds to dim the fairest morn! Oh! strong is faith, if wo like this be borne. For there is hush'd on earth A voice of gladness—there is veil'd a face, Whose parting leaves a dark and silent place, By the once-joyous hearth. A smile hath pass'd, which fill'd its home with light A soul, whose beauty made that smile so bright! But there is power with faith! Power, e'en though nature, o'er the untimely grave Must weep, when God resumes the gem He gave; For sorrow comes of Death, And with a yearning heart we linger on, When they, whose glance unlock'd its founts, are gone! But glory from the dust, And praise to Him, the merciful, for those On whose bright memory love may still repose, With an immortal trust! Praise for the dead, who leave us, when they part, Such hope as she hath left—“the pure in heart.” 1823. THE MAREMMA. “Mais elle etait du monde, ou les plus belles choses, Ont le pire destin; Et Rose elle a vécu ce que vivent les roses, L'espace d'un Matin.” Malherbe. There are bright scenes beneath Italian skies, Where glowing suns their purest light diffuse, Uncultured flowers in wild profusion rise, And nature lavishes her warmest hues; But trust thou not her smile, her balmy breath, Away! her charms are but the pomp of Death! He, in the vine-clad bowers, unseen is dwelling, Where the cool shade its freshness round thee throws, His voice, in every perfumed zephyr swelling, With gentlest whisper lures thee to repose; And the soft sounds that through the foliage sigh, But woo thee still to slumber and to die, Mysterious danger lurks, a syren, there, Not robed in terrors, or announced in gloom, But stealing o'er thee in the scented air, And veil'd in flowers, that smile to deck thy tomb; How may we deem, amidst their deep array, That heaven and earth but flatter to betray? Sunshine, and bloom, and verdure! Can it be, That these but charm us with destructive wiles? Where shall we turn, O Nature, if in thee Danger is mask'd in beauty—death in smiles? Oh! still the Circe of that fatal shore, Where she, the sun's bright daughter, dwelt of yore! There, year by year, that secret peril spreads, Disguised in loveliness, its baleful reign, And viewless blights o'er many a landscape sheds, Gay with the riches of the south, in vain, O'er fairy bowers and palaces of state, Passing unseen, to leave them desolate. And pillar'd halls, whose airy colonnades Were formed to echo music's choral tone, Are silent now, amidst deserted shades, See Madame de Staël's fine description, in her Corinne, of the Villa Borghese, deserted on account of malaria. Peopled by sculpture's graceful forms alone; And fountains dash unheard, by lone alcoves, Neglected temples, and forsaken groves. And there, where marble nymphs, in beauty gleaming, 'Midst the deep shades of plane and cypress rise, By wave or grot might Fancy linger, dreaming Of old Arcadia's woodland deities,— Wild visions!—there no sylvan powers convene,— Death reigns the genius of the Elysian scene. Ye, too, illustrious hills of Rome! that bear Traces of mightier beings on your brow, O'er you that subtle spirit of the air Extends the desert of his empire now; Broods o'er the wrecks of altar, fane, and dome, And makes the Cæsars' ruin'd halls his home. Youth, valour, beauty, oft have felt his power, His crown'd and chosen victims: o'er their lot Hath fond affection wept each blighted flower In turn was loved and mourn'd, and is forgot. But one who perish'd, left a tale of woe, Meet for as deep a sigh as pity can bestow. A voice of music, from Sienna's walls, Is floating joyous on the summer air, And there are banquets in her stately halls, And graceful revels of the gay and fair, And brilliant wreaths the altar have array'd, Where meet her noblest youth, and loveliest maid. To that young bride each grace hath Nature given, Which glows on Art's divinest dream,—her eye Hath a pure sunbeam of her native heaven— Her cheek a tinge of morning's richest dye; Fair as that daughter of the south, whose form Still breathes and charms, in Vinci's colours warm. An allusion to Leonardo da Vinci's picture of his wife Mona Lisa, supposed to be the most perfect imitation of Nature ever exhibited in painting.—See Vasari in his Lives of the Painters. But is she blest?—for sometimes o'er her smile A soft sweet shade of pensiveness is cast; And in her liquid glance there seems a-while To dwell some thought whose soul is with the past; Yet soon it flies—a cloud that leaves no trace, On the sky's azure, of its dwelling-place. Perchance, at times, within her heart may rise Remembrance of some early love or woe, Faded, yet scarce forgotten—in her eyes Wakening the half-form'd tear that may not flow; Yet radiant seems her lot as aught on earth, Where still some pining thought comes darkly o'er our mirth. The world before her smiles—its changeful gaze She hath not proved as yet; her path seems gay With flowers and sunshine, and the voice of praise Is still the joyous herald of her way; And beauty's light around her dwells, to throw O'er every scene its own resplendent glow. Such is the young Bianca—graced with all That nature, fortune, youth, at once can give; Pure in their loveliness—her looks recall Such dreams, as ne'er life's early bloom survive; And, when she speaks, each thrilling tone is fraught With sweetness, born of high and heavenly thought. And he, to whom are breathed her vows of faith Is brave and noble—child of high descent, He hath stood fearless in the ranks of death, 'Mid slaughter'd heaps, the warrior's monument: And proudly marshall'd his Carroccio's See the description of this sort of consecrated warchariot in Sismondi's Histoire des Republiques Italiennes, &amp;c., way, Amidst the wildest wreck of war's array. And his the chivalrous, commanding mien, Where high-born grandeur blends with courtly grace; Yet may a lightning glance at times be seen, Of fiery passions, darting o'er his face, And fierce the spirit kindling in his eye— But e'en while yet we gaze, its quick, wild flashes die. And calmly can Pietra smile, concealing, As if forgotten, vengeance, hate, remorse; And veil the workings of each darker feeling, Deep in his soul concentrating its force: But yet, he loves—O! who hath loved, nor known Affection's power exalt the bosom all its own? The days roll on—and still Bianca's lot Seems as a path of Eden—thou might'st deem That grief, the mighty chastener, had forgot To wake her soul from life's enchanted dream; And, if her brow a moment's sadness wear, It sheds but grace more intellectual there. A few short years, and all is changed—her fate Seems with some deep mysterious cloud o'ercast. Have jealous doubts transform'd to wrath and hate, The love whose glow expression's power surpass'd? Lo! on Pietra's brow a sullen gloom Is gathering day by day, prophetic of her doom. O! can he meet that eye, of light serene, Whence the pure spirit looks in radiance forth, And view that bright intelligence of mien Form'd to express but thoughts of loftiest worth, Yet deem that vice within that heart can reign? —How shall he e'er confide in aught on earth again? In silence oft, with strange vindictive gaze, Transient, yet fill'd with meaning, stern and wild, Her features, calm in beauty, he surveys, Then turns away, and fixes on her child So dark a glance, as thrills a mother's mind With some vague fear, scarce own'd, and undefined. There stands a lonely dwelling, by the wave Of the blue deep which bathes Italia's shore, Far from all sounds, but rippling seas that lave Grey rocks with foliage richly shadow'd o'er, And sighing winds, that murmur through the wood, Fringing the beach of that Hesperian flood. Fair is that house of solitude—and fair The green Maremma, far around it spread, A sun-bright waste of beauty—yet an air Of brooding sadness o'er the scene is shed, No human footstep tracks the lone domain, The desert of luxuriance glows in vain. And silent are the marble halls that rise 'Mid founts, and cypress walks, and olive groves: All sleeps in sunshine, 'neath cerulean skies, And still around the sea-breeze lightly roves; Yet every trace of man reveals alone, That there life once hath flourish'd—and is gone. There, till around them slowly, softly stealing, The summer air, deceit in every sigh, Came fraught with death, its power no sign revealing Thy sires, Pietra, dwelt, in days gone by; And strains of mirth and melody have flow'd Where stands, all voiceless now, the still abode. And thither doth her Lord, remorseless, bear Bianca with her child—his alter'd eye And brow a stern and fearful calmness wear, While his dark spirit seals their doom—to die; And the deep bodings of his victim's heart, Tell her, from fruitless hope at once to part. It is the summer's glorious prime—and blending Its blue transparence with the skies, the deep, Each tint of Heaven upon its breast descending, Scarce murmurs as it heaves, in glassy sleep, And on its wave reflects, more softly bright, That lovely shore of solitude and light. Fragrance in each warm southern gale is breathing, Deck'd with young flowers the rich Maremma glows, Neglected vines the trees are wildly wreathing, And the fresh myrtle in exuberance blows, And far around, a deep and sunny bloom Mantles the scene, as garlands robe the tomb. Yes! 'tis thy tomb. Bianca! fairest flower! The voice that calls thee speaks in every gale, Which o'er thee breathing with insidious power, Bids the young roses of thy cheek turn pale, And, fatal in its softness, day by day, Steals from that eye some trembling spark away. But sink not yet; for there are darker woes, Daughter of Beauty! in thy spring-morn fading, Sufferings more keen for thee reserved than those Of lingering death, which thus thine eye are shading! Nerve then thy heart to meet that bitter lot; 'Tis agony—but soon to be forgot! What deeper pangs maternal hearts can wring, Than hourly to behold the spoiler's breath Shedding, as mildews on the bloom of spring, O'er Infancy's fair cheek the blight of death? To gaze and shrink, as gathering shades o'ercast The pale smooth brow, yet watch it to the last! Such pangs were thine, young mother!—Thou didst bend O'er thy fair boy, and raise his drooping head; And faint and hopeless, far from every friend, Keep thy sad midnight-vigils near his bed, And watch his patient, supplicating eye, Fix'd upon thee—on thee!—who could'st no aid supply! There was no voice to cheer thy lonely woe Through those dark hours—to thee the wind's low sigh, And the faint murmur of the ocean's flow, Came like some spirit whispering—“He must die!” And thou didst vainly clasp him to the breast His young and sunny smile so oft with hope had blest. 'Tis past—that fearful trial—he is gone; But thou, sad mourner! hast not long to weep; The hour of nature's charter'd peace comes on, And thou shalt share thine infant's holy sleep. A few short sufferings yet—and death shall be As a bright messenger from heaven to thee. But ask not—hope not—one relenting thought From him who doom'd thee thus to waste away, Whose heart, with sullen, speechless vengeance fraught, Broods in dark triumph o'er thy slow decay; And coldly, sternly, silently can trace The gradual withering of each youthful grace. And yet the day of vain remorse shall come, When thou, bright victim! on his dreams shalt rise As an accusing angel—and thy tomb, A martyr's shrine, be hallow'd in his eyes! Then shall thine innocence his bosom wring, More than thy fancied guilt with jealous pangs could sting. Lift thy meek eyes to heaven—for all on earth, Young sufferer! fades before thee—Thou art lone— Hope, Fortune, Love, smiled brightly on thy birth, Thine hour of death is all Affliction's own! It is our task to suffer—and our fate To learn that mighty lesson, soon or late. The season's glory fades—the vintage-lay Through joyous Italy resounds no more; But mortal loveliness hath pass'd away, Fairer than aught in summer's glowing store. Beauty and youth are gone—behold them such As Death hath made them with his blighting touch! The summer's breath came o'er them—and they died! Softly it came to give luxuriance birth, Call'd forth young nature in her festal pride, But bore to them their summons from the earth! Again shall blow that mild, delicious breeze, And wake to life and light all flowers—but these. No sculptured urn, nor verse thy virtues telling, O lost and loveliest one! adorns thy grave; But o'er that humble cypress-shaded dwelling The dew-drops glisten, and the wild-flowers wave— Emblems more meet, in transient light and bloom, For thee, who thus didst pass in brightness to the tomb! STANZAS TO THE MEMORY OF GEORGE THE THIRD. “Among many nations was there no King like him.”—Nehemiah. “Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel!”—Samuel. Another warning sound! the funeral bell, Startling the cities of the isle once more With measured tones of melancholy swell, Strikes on th' awaken'd heart from shore to shore. He, at whose coming monarchs sink to dust, The chambers of our palaces hath trod, And the long-suffering spirit of the just, Pure from its ruins, hath return'd to God! Yet may not England o'er her Father weep; Thoughts to her bosom crowd, too many, and too deep. Vain voice of Reason, hush!—they yet must flow, The unrestrain'd, involuntary tears; A thousand feelings sanctify the wo, Roused by the glorious shades of vanish'd years. Tell us no more 'tis not the time for grief, Now that the exile of the soul is past, And Death, blest messenger of Heaven's relief, Hath borne the wanderer to his rest at last; For him, eternity hath tenfold day, We feel, we know, 'tis thus—yet nature will have way. What though amidst us, like a blasted oak, Sadd'ning the scene where once it nobly reign'd, A dread memorial of the lightning stroke, Stamp'd with its fiery record, he remain'd; Around that shatter'd tree still fondly clung Th' undying tendrils of our love, which drew Fresh nurture from its deep decay, and sprung Luxuriant thence, to Glory's ruin true; While England hung her trophies on the stem, That desolately stood, unconscious e'en of them. Of them unconscious! Oh mysterious doom! Who shall unfold the counsels of the skies? His was the voice which roused, as from the tomb, The realm's high soul to loftiest energies! His was the spirit, o'er the isles which threw The mantle of its fortitude; and wrought In every bosom, powerful to renew Each dying spark of pure and generous thought; The star of tempests! beaming on the mast, The glittering meteor, like a star, which often appears about a ship during tempests; if seen upon the main-mast, is considered by the sailors as an omen of good weather.— See Dampier's Voyages. The seaman's torch of Hope, 'midst perils deepening fast. Then from th' unslumbering influence of his worth, Strength, as of inspiration, fill'd the land; A young, but quenchless, flame went brightly forth, Kindled by him—who saw it not expand! Such was the will of heaven—the gifted seer, Who with his God had communed, face to face, And from the house of bondage, and of fear, In faith victorious, led the chosen race; He through the desert and the waste their guide, Saw dimly from afar, the promised land—and died. O full of days and virtues! on thy head Centred the woes of many a bitter lot; Fathers have sorrow'd o'er their beauteous dead, Eyes, quench'd in night, the sunbeam have forgot; Minds have striven buoyantly with evil years, And sunk beneath their gathering weight at length; But Pain for thee had fill'd a cup of tears, Where every anguish mingled all its strength; By thy lost child we saw thee weeping stand, And shadows deep around fell from th' Eternal's hand. Then came the noon of glory, which thy dreams Perchance of yore had faintly prophesied; But what to thee the splendour of its beams? The ice-rock glows not 'midst the summer's pride! Nations leap'd up to joy—as streams that burst, At the warm touch of spring, their frozen chain, And o'er the plains, whose verdure once they nursed, Roll in exulting melody again; And bright o'er earth the long majestic line Of England's triumphs swept, to rouse all hearts—but thine. Oh! what a dazzling vision, by the veil That o'er thy spirit hung, was shut from thee, When sceptred chieftains throng'd with palms to hail The crowning isle, th' anointed of the sea! Within thy palaces the lords of earth Met to rejoice—rich pageants glitter'd by, And stately revels imaged, in their mirth, The old magnificence of chivalry. They reach'd not thee—amidst them, yet alone, Stillness and gloom begirt one dim and shadowy throne. Yet there was mercy still—if joy no more Within that blasted circle might intrude, Earth had no grief whose footstep might pass o'er The silent limits of its solitude! If all unheard the bridal song awoke Our hearts' full echoes, as it swell'd on high; Alike unheard the sudden dirge, that broke On the glad strain, with dread solemnity! If the land's rose unheeded wore its bloom, Alike unfelt the storm that swept it to the tomb. And she, who, tried through all the stormy past, Severely, deeply proved, in many an hour, Watch'd o'er thee, firm and faithful to the last, Sustain'd, inspired, by strong affection's power; If to thy soul her voice no music bore— If thy closed eye and wandering spirit caught No light from looks, that fondly would explore Thy mien, for traces of responsive thought; Oh! thou wert spared the pang that would have thrill'd Thine inmost heart, when death that anxious bosom still'd. Thy loved ones fell around thee. Manhood's prime, Youth, with its glory, in its fulness, age, All, at the gates of their eternal clime Lay down, and closed their mortal pilgrimage; The land wore ashes for its perish'd flowers, The grave's imperial harvest. Thou, mean while, Didst walk unconscious through thy royal towers, The one that wept not in the tearful isle! As a tired warrior, on his battle-plain, Breathes deep in dreams amidst the mourners and the slain. And who can tell what visions might be thine? The stream of thought, though broken, still was pure! Still o'er that wave the stars of heaven might shine, Where earthly image would no more endure! Though many a step, of once-familiar sound, Came as a stranger's o'er thy closing ear, And voices breathed forgotten tones around, Which that paternal heart once thrill'd to hear; The mind hath senses of its own, and powers To people boundless worlds, in its most wandering hours. Nor might the phantoms to thy spirit known Be dark or wild, creations of remorse; Unstain'd by thee, the blameless past had thrown No fearful shadows o'er the future's course: For thee no cloud, from memory's dread abyss, Might shape such forms as haunt the tyrant's eye; And, closing up each avenue of bliss, Murmur their summons, to “despair and die!” No! e'en though joy depart, though reason cease, Still virtue's ruin'd home is redolent of peace. They might be with thee still—the loved, the tried, The fair, the lost—they might be with thee still! More softly seen, in radiance purified From each dim vapour of terrestrial ill; Long after earth received them, and the note Of the last requiem o'er their dust was pour'd, As passing sunbeams o'er thy soul might float Those forms, from us withdrawn—to thee restored! Spirits of holiness, in light reveal'd, To commune with a mind whose source of tears was seal'd. Came they with tidings from the worlds above Those viewless regions where the weary rest? Sever'd from earth, estranged from mortal love, Was thy mysterious converse with the blest? Or shone their visionary presence bright With human beauty?—did their smiles renew Those days of sacred and serene delight, When fairest beings in thy pathway grew? Oh! Heaven hath balm for every wound it makes, Healing the broken heart; it smites, but ne'er forsakes. These may be fantasies—and this alone, Of all we picture in our dreams, is sure; That rest, made perfect, is at length thine own, Rest, in thy God immortally secure! Enough for tranquil faith; released from all The woes that graved Heaven's lessons on thy brow, No cloud to dim, no fetter to enthral, Haply thine eye is on thy people now; Whose love around thee still its offerings shed, Though vainly sweet, as flowers, grief's tribute to the dead. But if th' ascending, disembodied mind, Borne, on the wings of morning, to the skies, May cast one glance of tenderness behind On scenes once hallow'd by its mortal ties, How much hast thou to gaze on! all that lay By the dark mantle of thy soul conceal'd, The might, the majesty, the proud array Of England's march o'er many a noble field, All spread beneath thee, in a blaze of light, Shine like some glorious land, view'd from an Alpine height. Away, presumptuous thought!—departed saint! To thy freed vision what can earth display Of pomp, of royalty, that is not faint, Seen from the birth-place of celestial day? Oh! pale and weak the sun's reflected rays, E'en in their fervour of meridian heat, To him, who in the sanctuary may gaze On the bright cloud that fills the mercy-seat! And thou may'st view, from thy divine abode, The dust of empires flit before a breath of God. And yet we mourn thee! Yes! thy place is void Within our hearts—there veil'd thine image dwelt, But cherish'd still; and o'er that tie destroy'd, Though faith rejoice, fond nature still must melt. Beneath the long-loved sceptre of thy sway, Thousands were born, who now in dust repose, And many a head, with years and sorrows grey, Wore youth's bright tresses, when thy star arose; And many a glorious mind, since that fair dawn, Hath fill'd our sphere with light, now to its source withdrawn. Earthquakes have rock'd the nations:—things revered, Th' ancestral fabrics of the world, went down In ruins, from whose stones Ambition rear'd His lonely pyramid of dread renown. But when the fires that long had slumber'd, pent Deep in men's bosoms, with volcanic force, Bursting their prison-house, each bulwark rent, And swept each holy barrier from their course, Firm and unmoved, amidst that lava-flood, Still, by thine arm upheld, our ancient landmarks stood. Be they eternal!—Be thy children found Still to their country's altars true like thee! And, while “the name of Briton” is a sound Of rallying music to the brave and free, With the high feelings, at the word which swell, To make the breast a shrine for Freedom's flame, Be mingled thoughts of him, who loved so well, Who left so pure, its heritage of fame! Let earth with trophies guard the conqueror's dust, Heaven in our souls embalms the memory of the just. All else shall pass away—the thrones of kings, The very traces of their tombs depart; But number not with perishable things The holy records Virtue leaves the heart, Heir-looms from race to race!—and oh! in days, When, by the yet unborn, thy deeds are blest, When our sons learn, “as household words,” thy praise, Still on thine offspring, may thy spirit rest! And many a name of that imperial line, Father and patriot! blend, in England's songs, with thine! A TALE OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY. A FRAGMENT. The moonbeam, quivering o'er the wave, Sleeps in pale gold on wood and hill, The wild wind slumbers in its cave, And heaven is cloudless—earth is still! The pile, that crowns yon savage height With battlements of Gothic might, Rises in softer pomp array'd, Its massy towers half lost in shade, Half touch'd with mellowing light! The rays of night, the tints of time, Soft-mingling on its dark-grey stone, O'er its rude strength and mien sublime, A placid smile have thrown; And far beyond, where wild and high, Bounding the pale blue summer sky, A mountain-vista meets the eye, Its dark, luxuriant woods assume A pencil'd shade, a softer gloom; Its jutting cliffs have caught the light, Its torrents glitter through the night, While every cave and deep recess Frowns in more shadowy awfulness. Scarce moving on the glassy deep Yon gallant vessel seems to sleep, But darting from its side, How swiftly does its boat design A slender, silvery, waving line Of radiance o'er the tide! No sound is on the summer seas, But the low dashing of the oar, And faintly sighs the midnight breeze Through woods that fringe the rocky shore. —That boat has reach'd the silent bay, The dashing oar has ceased to play, The breeze has murmur'd and has died In forest-shades, on ocean's tide. No step, no tone, no breath of sound Disturbs the loneliness profound; And midnight spreads o'er earth and main A calm so holy and so deep, That voice of mortal were profane, To break on nature's sleep! It is the hour for thought to soar, High o'er the cloud of earthly woes; For rapt devotion to adore, For passion to repose; And virtue to forget her tears, In visions of sublimer spheres! For oh! those transient gleams of heaven, To calmer, purer spirits given, Children of hallow'd peace, are known In solitude and shade alone! Like flowers that shun the blaze of noon, To blow beneath the midnight moon, The garish world they will not bless, But only live in loneliness! Hark! did some note of plaintive swell Melt on the stillness of the air? Or was it fancy's powerful spell That woke such sweetness there? For wild and distant it arose, Like sounds that bless the bard's repose, When in lone wood, or mossy cave He dreams beside some fountain-wave, And fairy worlds delight the eyes Wearied with life's realities. —Was it illusion?—yet again Rises and falls th' enchanted strain Mellow, and sweet, and faint, As if some spirit's touch had given The soul of sound to harp of heaven To soothe a dying saint! Is it the mermaid's distant shell, Warbling beneath the moonlit wave? —Such witching tones might lure full well The seaman to his grave! Sure from no mortal touch ye rise, Wild, soft, aerial melodies! —Is it the song of woodland-fay From sparry grot, or haunted bower? Hark! floating on, the magic lay Draws near yon ivied tower! Now nearer still, the listening ear May catch sweet harp notes, faint, yet clear; And accents low, as if in fear, Thus murmur, half suppress'd:— “Awake! the moon is bright on high, The sea is calm, the bark is nigh, The world is hush'd to rest!” Then sinks the voice—the strain is o'er, Its last low cadence dies along the shore. Fair Bertha hears th' expected song, Swift from her tower she glides along; No echo to her tread awakes, Her fairy step no slumber breaks, And, in that hour of silence deep, While all around the dews of sleep O'erpower each sense, each eyelid steep, Quick throbs her heart with hope and fear, Her dark eye glistens with a tear. Half-wavering now, the varying cheek And sudden pause, her doubts bespeak, The lip now flush'd, now pale as death, The trembling frame, the fluttering breath! Oh! in that moment, o'er her soul, What struggling passions claim control! Fear, duty, love, in conflict high, By turns have won th' ascendency; And as, all tremulously bright, Streams o'er her face the beam of night, What thousand mix'd emotions play O'er that fair face, and melt away: Like forms whose quick succession gleams O'er fancy's rainbow-tinted dreams; Like the swift glancing lights that rise 'Midst the wild cloud of stormy skies, And traverse ocean o'er; So in that full, impassion'd eye The changeful meanings rise and die, Just seen—and then no more! But oh! too short that pause—again Thrills to her heart that witching strain:— “Awake! the midnight moon is bright, Awake! the moments wing their flight, Haste! or they speed in vain!” O, call of love! thy potent spell, O'er that weak heart prevails too well; The “still small voice” is heard no more That pleaded duty's cause before, And fear is hush'd, and doubt is gone, And pride forgot, and reason flown! Her cheek, whose colour came and fled, Resumes its warmest, brightest red, Her step its quick elastic tread, Her eye its beaming smile! Through lonely court and silent hall, Flits her light shadow o'er the wall, And still that low, harmonious call Melts on her ear the while! Though love's quick ear alone could tell The words its accents faintly swell:— “Awake, while yet the lingering night And stars and seas befriend our flight, O! haste, while all is well!” The halls, the courts, the gates, are past, She gains the moonlit beach at last. Who waits to guide her trembling feet? Who flies the fugitive to greet? He, to her youthful heart endear'd By all it e'er had hoped and feared, Twined with each wish, with every thought, Each day-dream fancy e'er had wrought, Whose tints portray, with flattering skill, What brighter worlds alone fulfil! —Alas! that aught so fair should fly, Thy blighting wand, Reality! A chieftain's mien her Osbert bore, A pilgrim's lowly robes he wore, Disguise that vainly strove to hide Bearing and glance of martial pride; For he in many a battle scene, On many a rampart-breach had been; Had sternly smiled at danger nigh, Had seen the valiant bleed and die, And proudly rear'd on hostile tower, 'Midst falchion-clash, and arrowy shower, Britannia's banner high! And though some ancient feud had taught His Bertha's sire to loathe his name, More noble warrior never fought, For glory's prize, or England's fame. And well his dark, commanding eye, And form and step of stately grace, Accorded with achievements high, Soul of emprize and chivalry, Bright name, and generous race! His cheek, embrown'd by many a sun, Tells a proud tale of glory won, Of vigil, march, and combat rude, Valour, and toil, and fortitude! E'en while youth's earliest blushes threw Warm o'er that cheek, their vivid hue, His gallant soul, his stripling-form, Had braved the battle's rudest storm; When England's conquering archers stood, And dyed thy plain, Poitiers, with blood, When shiver'd axe, and cloven shield, And shatter'd helmet, strew'd the field, And France around her King in vain, Had marshal'd valour's noblest train; In that dread strife, his lightning eye, Had flash'd with transport keen and high, And 'midst the battle's wildest tide, Throbb'd his young heart with hope and pride. Alike that fearless heart could brave, Death on the war-field or the wave; Alike in tournament or fight, That ardent spirit found delight! Yet oft, 'midst hostile scenes afar, Bright o'er his soul a vision came, Rising, like some benignant star, On stormy seas, or plains of war, To soothe, with hopes more dear than fame, The heart that throbb'd to Bertha's name! And 'midst the wildest rage of fight, And in the deepest calm of night, To her his thoughts would wing their flight, With fond devotion warm; Oft would those glowing thoughts portray Some home, from tumults far away, Graced with that angel form! And now his spirit fondly deems Fulfill'd its loveliest, dearest dreams! Who, with pale cheek, and locks of snow, In minstrel garb, attends the chief? The moonbeam on his thoughtful brow Reveals a shade of grief. Sorrow and time have touch'd his face, With mournful yet majestic grace, Soft as the melancholy smile Of sunset on some ruin'd pile! —It is the bard, whose song had power, To lure the maiden from her tower; The bard whose wild, inspiring lays, E'en in gay childhood's earliest days, First woke, in Osbert's kindling breast. The flame that will not be represt, The pulse that throbs for praise! Those lays had banish'd from his eye, The bright, soft tears of infancy, Had soothed the boy to calm repose, Had hush'd his bosom's earliest woes; And when the light of thought awoke, When first young reason's day-spring broke, More powerful still, they bade arise His spirit's burning energies! Then the bright dream of glory warm'd, Then the loud pealing war-song charm'd, The legends of each martial line, The battle-tales of Palestine; And oft, since then, his deeds had proved, Themes of the lofty lays he loved! Now, at triumphant love's command, Since Osbert leaves his native land, Forsaking glory's high career, For her, than glory far more dear; Since hope's gay dream, and meteor ray, To distant regions points his way, That there Affection's hands may dress, A fairy bower for happiness; That fond, devoted bard, though now Time's wint'ry garland wreathes his brow. Though quench'd the sunbeam of his eye, And fled his spirit's buoyancy; And strength and enterprise are past, Still follows constant to the last! Though his sole wish was but to die Midst the calm scenes of days gone by; And all that hallows and endears The memory of departed years— Sorrow, and joy, and time, have twined To those loved scenes, his pensive mind; Ah! what can tear the links apart, That bind his chieftain to his heart? What smile but his with joy can light The eye obscured by age's night? Last of a loved and honour'd line, Last tie to earth in life's decline, Till death its lingering spark shall dim, That faithful eye must gaze on him! Silent and swift, with footstep light, Haste on those fugitives of night, They reach the boat—the rapid oar Soon wafts them from the wooded shore The bark is gain'd—a gallant few, Vassals of Osbert, form its crew; The pennant, in the moonlight beam, With soft suffusion glows; From the white sail a silvery gleam, Falls on the wave's repose; Long shadows undulating play, From mast and streamer, o'er the bay; But still so hush'd the summer-air, They tremble, 'midst that scene so fair, Lest morn's first beam behold them there —Wake, viewless wanderer! breeze of night, From river-wave, or mountain-height, Or dew-bright couch of moss and flowers, By haunted spring, in forest bowers; Or dost thou lurk in pearly cell, In amber grot, where mermaids dwell, And cavern'd gems their lustre throw, O'er the red sea-flowers' vivid glow? Where treasures, not for mortal gaze, In solitary splendour blaze; And sounds, ne'er heard by mortal ear, Swell through the deep's unfathom'd sphere? What grove of that mysterious world, Holds thy light wing in slumber furl'd? Awake! o'er glittering seas to rove, Awake! to guide the bark of love! Swift fly the midnight hours, and soon Shall fade the bright propitious moon; Soon shall the waning stars grow pale, E'en now—but lo! the rustling sail Swells to the new-sprung ocean gale! The bark glides on—their fears are o'er, Recedes the bold romantic shore, Its features mingling fast; Gaze, Bertha, gaze, thy lingering eye May still each lovely scene descry Of years for ever past! There wave the woods, beneath whose shade, With bounding step, thy childhood play'd; 'Midst ferny glades, and mossy lawns, Free as their native birds and fawns; Listening the sylvan sounds, that float On each low breeze, 'midst dells remote; The ringdove's deep, melodious moan, The rustling deer in thickets lone; The wild-bee's hum, the aspen's sigh, The wood-stream's plaintive harmony. Dear scenes of many a sportive hour, There thy own mountains darkly tower! 'Midst their grey rocks no glen so rude, But thou hast loved its solitude! No path so wild but thou hast known, And traced its rugged course alone! The earliest wreath that bound thy hair, Was twined of glowing heath-flowers there. There, in the day-spring of thy years, Undimm'd by passions or by tears, Oft, while thy bright, enraptured eye Wandered o'er ocean, earth, or sky, While the wild breeze that round thee blew, Tinged thy warm cheek with richer hue; Pure as the skies that o'er thy head Their clear and cloudless azure spread; Pure as that gale, whose light wing drew Its freshness from the mountain dew; Glow'd thy young heart with feelings high, A heaven of hallow'd ecstasy! Such days were thine! ere love had drawn A cloud o'er that celestial dawn! As the clear dews in morning's beam, With soft reflected colouring stream, Catch every tint of eastern gem, To form the rose's diadem; But vanish when the noontide hour Glows fiercely on the shrinking flower; Thus in thy soul each calm delight, Like morn's first dew-drops, pure and bright, Fled swift from passion's blighting fire, Or linger'd only to expire! Spring, on thy native hills again, Shall bid neglected wild-flowers rise, And call forth, in each grassy glen, Her brightest emerald dyes! There shall the lonely mountain-rose, Wreath of the cliffs, again disclose; 'Midst rocky dells, each well-known stream, Shall sparkle in the summer beam; The birch, o'er precipice and cave, Its feathery foliage still shall wave; The ash 'midst rugged clefts unveil Its coral clusters to the gale, And autumn shed a warmer bloom, O'er the rich heath and glowing broom. But thy light footstep there no more, Each path, each dingle shall explore; In vain may smile each green recess, —Who now shall pierce its loneliness? The stream through shadowy glens may stray, —Who now shall trace its glistening way? In solitude, in silence deep, Shrined 'midst her rocks, shall echo sleep, No lute's wild swell again shall rise, To wake her mystic melodies. All soft may blow the mountain air, —It will not wave thy graceful hair! The mountain-rose may bloom and die, —It will not meet thy smiling eye! But like those scenes of vanish'd days, Shall others ne'er delight; Far lovelier lands shall meet thy gaze, Yet seem not half so bright! O'er the dim woodlands' fading hue, Still gleams yon Gothic pile on high; Gaze on, while yet 'tis thine to view That home of infancy! Heed not the night-dew's chilling power, Heed not the sea-wind's coldest hour, But pause, and linger on the deck, Till of those towers no trace, no speck, Is gleaming o'er the main; For when the mist of morn shall rise, Blending the sea, the shore, the skies, That home, once vanish'd from thine eyes, Shall bless them ne'er again! There the dark tales and songs of yore, First with strange transport thrill'd thy soul, E'en while their fearful, mystic lore, From thy warm cheek the life-bloom stole; There, while thy father's raptured ear, Dwelt fondly on a strain so dear, And in his eye the trembling tear, Reveal'd his spirit's trance; How oft, those echoing halls along, Thy thrilling voice has swell'd the song, Tradition wild of other days, Or troubadour's heroic lays, Or legend of romance! Oh! many an hour has there been thine, That memory's pencil oft shall dress In softer shades, and tints that shine In mellow'd loveliness! While thy sick heart, and fruitless tears, Shall mourn, with fond and deep regret, The sunshine of thine early years, Scarce deem'd so radiant—till it set! The cloudless peace, unprized till gone, The bliss, till vanish'd, hardly known! On rock and turret, wood and hill, The fading moonbeams linger still; Still, Bertha, gaze on yon grey tower, At evening's last and sweetest hour, While varying still, the western skies Flush'd the clear seas with rainbow-dyes, Whose warm suffusions glow'd and pass'd, Each richer, lovelier, than the last; How oft, while gazing on the deep, That seem'd a heaven of peace to sleep, As if its wave, so still, so fair, More frowning mien might never wear, The twilight calm of mental rest, Would steal in silence o'er thy breast, And wake that dear and balmy sigh, That softly breathes the spirit's harmony! —Ah! ne'er again shall hours to thee be given, Of joy on earth—so near allied to Heaven! Why starts the tear to Bertha's eye? Is not her long-loved Osbert nigh? Is there a grief his voice, his smile, His words, are fruitless to beguile? —Oh! bitter to the youthful heart, That scarce a pang, a care has known, The hour when first from scenes we part, Where life's bright spring has flown! Forsaking, o'er the world to roam, That little shrine of peace—our home! E'en if delighted fancy throw O'er that cold world, her brightest glow, Painting its untried paths with flowers, That will not live in earthly bowers; (Too frail, too exquisite, to bear One breath of life's ungenial air;) E'en if such dreams of hope arise, As Heaven alone can realize; Cold were the breast that would not heave One sigh, the home of youth to leave; Stern were the heart that would not swell To breathe life's saddest word—farewell! Though earth has many a deeper woe, Though tears, more bitter far, must flow, That hour, whate'er our future lot, That first fond grief, is ne'er forgot! Such was the pang of Bertha's heart, The thought, that bade the tear-drop start; And Osbert by her side Heard the deep sigh, whose bursting swell Nature's fond struggle told too well; And days of future bliss portray'd, And love's own eloquence essay'd, To soothe his plighted bride! Of bright Arcadian scenes he tells, In that sweet land to which they fly; The vine-clad rocks, the fragrant dells Of blooming Italy. For he had roved a pilgrim there, And gazed on many a spot so fair, It seem'd like some enchanted grove, Where only peace, and joy, and love, Those exiles of the world, might rove, And breathe its heavenly air; And, all unmix'd with ruder tone, Their “wood-notes wild” be heard alone! Far from the frown of stern control, That vainly would subdue the soul, There shall their long-affianced hands, Be join'd in consecrated bands, And in some rich, romantic vale, Circled with heights of Alpine snow, Where citron-woods enrich the gale, And scented shrubs their balm exhale, And flowering myrtles blow; And 'midst the mulberry boughs on high, Weaves the wild vine her tapestry: On some bright streamlet's emerald side, Where cedars wave, in graceful pride, Bosom'd in groves, their home shall rise, A shelter'd bower of Paradise! Thus would the lover soothe to rest With tales of hope her anxious breast; Nor vain that dear enchanting lore, Her soul's bright visions to restore, And bid gay phantoms of delight Float, in soft colouring, o'er her sight. —Oh! youth, sweet May-morn, fled so soon, Far brighter than life's loveliest noon, How oft thy spirit's buoyant power Will triumph, e'en in sorrow's hour Prevailing o'er regret! As rears its head th' elastic flower Though the dark tempest's recent shower Hang on its petals yet! Ah! not so soon can hope's gay smile The aged bard to joy beguile: Those silent years that steal away The cheek's warm rose, the eye's bright ray, Win from the mind a nobler prize, E'en all its buoyant energies! For him the April days are past, When grief was but a fleeting cloud; No transient shade will sorrow cast, When age the spirit's might has bow'd! And, as he sees the land grow dim, That native land, now lost to him, Fix'd are his eyes, and clasp'd his hands, And long in speechless grief he stands. So desolately calm his air, He seems an image, wrought to bear The stamp of deep, though hush'd despair; Motion and life no sign bespeaks Save that the night-breeze, o'er his cheeks, Just waves his silvery hair! Nought else could teach the eye to know He was no sculptured form of woe! Long gazing o'er the dark'ning flood, Pale in that silent grief he stood; Till the cold moon was waning fast, And many a lovely star had died, And the grey heavens deep shadows cast Far o'er the slumbering tide; And robed in one dark solemn hue, Arose the distant shore to view. Then, starting from his trance of woe, Tears, long suppress'd, in freedom flow, While thus his wild and plaintive strain, Blends with the murmur of the main. THE BARD'S FAREWELL. Thou setting moon! when next thy rays Are trembling on the shadowy deep, The land, now fading from my gaze, These eyes in vain shall weep; And wander o'er the lonely sea, And fix their tearful glance on thee, On thee! whose light so softly gleams, Through the green oaks that fringe my native streams. But, 'midst those ancient groves, no more Shall I thy quivering lustre hail, Its plaintive strain my harp must pour, To swell a foreign gale; The rocks, the woods, whose echoes woke, When its full tones their stillness broke, Deserted now, shall hear alone, The brook's wild voice, the wind's mysterious moan. And oh! ye fair, forsaken halls, Left by your lord to slow decay, Soon shall the trophies on your walls Be mouldering fast away! There shall no choral songs resound, There shall no festal board be crown'd; But ivy wreath the silent gate, And all be hush'd, and cold, and desolate. No banner from the stately tower, Shall spread its blazon'd folds on high, There the wild brier and summer flower, Unmark'd, shall wave and die. Home of the mighty! thou art lone, The noonday of thy pride is gone, And, 'midst thy solitude profound, A step shall echo like unearthly sound! From thy cold hearths no festal blaze Shall fill the hall with ruddy light, Nor welcome, with convivial rays, Some pilgrim of the night; But there shall grass luxuriant spread, As o'er the dwellings of the dead; And the deep swell of every blast, Seem a wild dirge for years of grandeur past. And I—my joy of life is fled, My spirit's power, my bosom's glow, The raven locks that graced my head, Wave in a wreath of snow! And where the star of youth arose, I deem'd life's lingering ray should close, And those loved trees my tomb o'ershade, Beneath whose arching bowers my childhood play'd. Vain dream! that tomb in distant earth Shall rise, forsaken and forgot; And thou, sweet land, that gav'st me birth, A grave must yield me not! Yet, haply he for whom I leave Thy shores, in life's dark winter-eve, When cold the hand, and closed the lays, And mute the voice he loved to praise, O'er the hush'd harp one tear may shed, And one frail garland o'er the minstrel's bed! BELSHAZZAR'S FEAST. Twas night in Babylon: yet many a beam, Of lamps far glittering from her domes on high, Shone, brightly mingling in Euphrates' stream With the clear stars of that Chaldean sky, Whose azure knows no cloud: each whisper'd sigh Of the soft night-breeze through her terrace bowers, Bore deepening tones of joy and melody, O'er an illumined wilderness of flowers; And the glad city's voice went up from all her towers. But prouder mirth was in the kingly hall, Where, 'midst adoring slaves, a gorgeous band, High at the stately midnight festival, Belshazzar sat enthroned. There luxury's hand Had shower'd around all treasures that expand Beneath the burning East; all gems that pour The sunbeams back; all sweets of many a land, Whose gales waft incense from their spicy shore; —But mortal pride look'd on, and still demanded more. With richer zest the banquet may be fraught, A loftier theme may swell the exulting strain! The lord of nations spoke,—and forth were brought The spoils of Salem's devastated fane. Thrice holy vessels!—pure from earthly stain, And set apart, and sanctified to Him, Who deign'd within the oracle to reign, Reveal'd, yet shadow'd; making noonday dim, To that most glorious cloud between the cherubim. They came, and louder peal'd the voice of song, And pride flash'd brighter from the kindling eye, And He who sleeps not heard the elated throng, In mirth that plays with thunderbolts, defy The Rock of Zion!—Fill the nectar high, High in the cups of consecrated gold! And crown the bowl with garlands, ere they die, And bid the censers of the temple hold Offerings to Babel's gods, the mighty ones of old! Peace!—is it but a phantom of the brain, Thus shadow'd forth, the senses to appal, Yon fearful vision?—Who shall gaze again To search its cause?—Along the illumined wall, Startling, yet riveting the eyes of all. Darkly it moves;—a hand, a human hand, O'er the bright lamps of that resplendent hall, In silence tracing, as a mystic wand, Words all unknown, the tongue of some far distant land! There are pale cheeks around the regal board, And quivering limbs, and whispers deep and low, And fitful starts!—the wine, in triumph pour'd, Untasted foams, the song hath ceased to flow, The waving censer drops to earth—and lo! The king of men, the ruler, girt with mirth, Trembles before a shadow!—Say not so! —The child of dust, with guilt's foreboding sight, Shrinks from the dread Unknown, the avenging Infinite! “But haste ye!—bring Chaldea's gifted seers, The men of prescience!—haply to their eyes, Which track the future through the rolling spheres, Yon mystic sign may speak in prophecies.” They come—the readers of the midnight skies, They that gave voice to visions—but in vain! Still wrapt in clouds the awful secret lies, It hath no language 'midst the starry train, Earth has no gifted tongue Heaven's mysteries to explain. Then stood forth one, a child of other sires, And other inspiration!—one of those Who on the willows hung their captive lyres, And sat, and wept, where Babel's river flows. His eye was bright, and yet the pale repose Of his pure features half o'eraw'd the mind, Telling of inward mysteries—joys and woes In lone recesses of the soul enshrined; Depths of a being seal'd and sever'd from mankind. Yes!—what was earth to him, whose spirit pass'd Time's utmost bounds?—on whose unshrinking sight Ten thousand shapes of burning glory cast Their full resplendence?—Majesty and might Were in his dreams;—for him the veil of light Shrouding Heaven's inmost sanctuary and throne, The curtain of th' unutterably bright Was raised!—to him, in fearful splendour shown, Ancient of Days! e'en Thou mad'st thy dread presence known. He spoke:—the shadows of the things to come Pass'd o'er his soul:—“O King, elate in pride! God hath sent forth the writing of thy doom— The one, the living, God by thee defied! He, in whose balance earthly lords are tried, Hath weigh'd, and found thee wanting. 'Tis decreed The conqueror's hands thy kingdom shall divide, The stranger to thy throne of power succeed! Thy days are full—they come,—the Persian and the Mede!” There fell a moment's thrilling silence round— A breathless pause!—the hush of hearts that beat, And limbs that quiver:—Is there not a sound, A gathering cry, a tread of hurrying feet? —'Twas but some echo in the crowded street, Of far-heard revelry; the shout, the song, The measured dance to music wildly sweet, That speeds the stars their joyous course along— Away; nor let a dream disturb the festal throng! Peace yet again! Hark! steps in tumult flying, Steeds rushing on, as o'er a battle-field! The shouts of hosts exulting or defying, The press of multitudes that strive or yield! And the loud startling clash of spear and shield, Sudden as earthquake's burst; and, blent with these, The last wild shriek of those whose doom is seal'd In their full mirth;—all deepening on the breeze, As the long stormy roll of far-advancing seas! And nearer yet the trumpet's blast is swelling, Loud, shrill, and savage, drowning every cry; And, lo! the spoiler in the regal dwelling, Death—bursting on the halls of revelry! Ere on their brows one fragile rose-leaf die, The sword hath raged through joy's devoted train; Ere one bright star be faded from the sky, Red flames, like banners, wave from dome and fane; Empire is lost and won—Belshazzar with the slain. THE LAST CONSTANTINE. “Thou strivest nobly, When hearts of sterner stuff perhaps had sunk; And o'er thy fall, if it be so decreed, Good men will mourn, and brave men will shed tears. Fame I look not for, But to sustain, in Heaven's all-seeing eye, Before my fellow men, in mine own sight, With graceful virtue and becoming pride, The dignity and honour of a man, Thus station'd as I am, I will do all That man may do.” Miss Baillie's Constantine Palæologus. I The fires grew pale on Rome's deserted shrines, In the dim grot the Pythia's voice had died; —Shout, for the City of the Constantines, The rising city of the billow-side, The City of the Cross!—great ocean's bride, Crown'd with her birth she sprung!—Long ages past, And still she look'd in glory o'er the tide, Which at her feet barbaric riches cast, Pour'd by the burning East, all joyously and fast. II Long ages past!—they left her porphyry halls Still trod by kingly footsteps. Gems and gold Broider'd her mantle, and her castled walls Frown'd in their strength; yet there were signs which told The days were full. The pure high faith of old Was changed; and on her silken couch of sleep She lay, and murmur'd if a rose-leaf's fold Disturb'd her dreams; and call'd her slaves to keep Their watch, that no rude sound might reach her o'er the deep. III But there are sounds that from the regal dwelling Free hearts and fearless only may exclude; 'Tis not alone the wind, at midnight swelling, Breaks on the soft repose by luxury woo'd! There are unbidden footsteps, which intrude Where the lamps glitter, and the wine-cup flows, And darker hues have stain'd the marble, strew'd With the fresh myrtle, and the short-lived rose, And Parian walls have rung to the dread march of foes. IV A voice of multitudes is on the breeze, Remote, yet solemn as the night-storm's roar Through Ida's giant-pines! Across the seas A murmur comes, like that the deep winds bore From Tempé's haunted river to the shore Of the reed-crown'd Eurotas; when, of old, Dark Asia sent her battle-myriads o'er Th' indignant wave, which would not be controll'd, But past the Persian's chain in boundless freedom roll'd. V And it is thus again?—Swift oars are dashing The parted waters, and a light is cast On their white foam-wreaths, from the sudden flashing Of Tartar spears, whose ranks are thickening fast. There swells a savage trumpet on the blast, A music of the deserts, wild and deep, Wakening strange echoes, as the shores are pass'd Where low 'midst Ilion's dust her conquerors sleep, O'ershadowing with high names each rude sepulchral heap. VI War from the West!—the snows on Thracian hills Are loosed by Spring's warm breath; yet o'er the lands Which Hæmus girds, the chainless mountain rills Pour down less swiftly than the Moslem bands. War from the East!—'midst Araby's lone sands, More lonely now the few bright founts may be, While Ismael's bow is bent in warrior-hands Against the Golden City of the sea: —Oh! for a soul to fire thy dust, Thermopylæ! VII Hear yet again, ye mighty!—Where are they, Who, with their green Olympic garlands crown'd, Leap'd up, in proudly beautiful array, As to a banquet gathering, at the sound Of Persia's clarion?—Far and joyous round, From the pine-forests, and the mountain-snows, And the low sylvan valleys, to the bound Of the bright waves, at freedom's voice they rose! —Hath it no thrilling tone to break the tomb's repose? VIII They slumber with their swords!—The olive-shades In vain are whispering their immortal tale! In vain the spirit of the past pervades The soft winds, breathing through each Grecian vale. —Yet must Thou wake, though all unarm'd and pale, Devoted City!—Lo! the Moslem's spear, Red from its vintage, at thy gates; his sail Upon thy waves, his trumpet in thine ear! —Awake! and summon those, who yet, perchance, may hear! IX Be hush'd, thou faint and feeble voice of weeping! Lift ye the banner of the Cross on high, And call on chiefs, whose noble sires are sleeping In their proud graves of sainted chivalry, Beneath the palms and cedars, where they sigh To Syrian gales!—The sons of each brave line, From their baronial halls shall hear your cry, And seize the arms which flash'd round Salem's shrine, And wield for you the swords once waved for Palestine! X All still, all voiceless!—and the billow's roar Alone replies!—Alike their soul is gone Who shared the funeral-feast on Œta's shore, And theirs that o'er the field of Ascalon Swell'd the crusader's hymn!—Then gird thou on Thine armour, Eastern Queen! and meet the hour Which waits thee ere the day's fierce work is done With a strong heart; so may thy helmet tower Unshiver'd through the storm, for generous hope is power! XI But linger not,—array thy men of might! The shores, the seas, are peopled with thy foes. Arms through thy cypress groves are gleaming bright, And the dark huntsmen of the wild, repose Beneath the shadowy marble porticoes Of thy proud villas. Nearer and more near, Around thy walls the sons of battle close; Each hour, each moment, hath its sound of fear, Which the deep grave alone is charter'd not to hear! XII Away! bring wine, bring odours, to the shade Where the tall pine and poplar blend on high! Bring roses, exquisite, but soon to fade! Snatch every brief delight,—since we must die!— Yet is the hour, degenerate Greeks! gone by, For feast in vine-wreath'd bower, or pillar'd hall; Dim gleams the torch beneath yon fiery sky, And deep and hollow is the tambour's call, And from the startled hand th' untasted cup will fall. XIII The night—the glorious oriental night, Hath lost the silence of her purple heaven, With its clear stars! The red artillery's light, Athwart her worlds of tranquil splendour driven, To the still firmament's expanse hath given Its own fierce glare, wherein each cliff and tower Starts wildly forth; and now the air is riven With thunder-bursts, and now dull smoke-clouds lower, Veiling the gentle moon, in her most hallow'd hour. XIV Sounds from the waters, sounds upon the earth, Sounds in the air, of battle! Yet with these A voice is mingling, whose deep tones give birth To Faith and Courage! From luxurious ease A gallant few have started! O'er the seas, From the Seven Towers, their banner waves its sign, And Hope is whispering in the joyous breeze, Which plays amidst its folds. That voice was thine; Thy soul was on that band, devoted Constantine. XV Was Rome thy parent? Didst thou catch from her The fire that lives in thine undaunted eye? —That city of the throne and sepulchre Hath given proud lessons how to reign and die! Heir of the Cæsars! did that lineage high, Which, as a triumph to the grave, hath pass'd With its long march of sceptred imag'ry, Th' heroic mantle o'er thy spirit cast? —Thou! of an eagle-race the noblest and the last! XVI Vain dreams! upon that spirit hath descended Light from the living Fountain, whence each thought Springs pure and holy! In that eye is blended A spark, with Earth's triumphal memories fraught, And, far within, a deeper meaning, caught From worlds unseen. A hope, a lofty trust, Whose resting-place on buoyant wing is sought (Though through its veil, seen darkly from the dust), In realms where Time no more hath power upon the just. XVII Those were proud days, when on the battle plain, And in the sun's bright face, and 'midst th' array Of awe-struck hosts, and circled by the slain, The Roman cast his glittering mail away, And while a silence, as of midnight, lay O'er breathless thousands at his voice who started, Call'd on the unseen, terrific powers that sway The heights, the depths, the shades; then, fearless-hearted, Girt on his robe of death, and for the grave departed! XVIII But then, around him as the javelins rush'd, From earth to heaven swell'd up the loud acclaim; And, ere his heart's last free libation gush'd, With a bright smile the warrior caught his name Far-floating on the winds! And Vict'ry came, And made the hour of that immortal deed A life, in fiery feeling! Valour's aim Had sought no loftier guerdon. Thus to bleed, Was to be Rome's high star!—He died—and had his meed. XIX But praise—and dearer, holier praise, be theirs, Who, in the stillness and the solitude Of hearts press'd earthwards by a weight of cares, Uncheer'd by Fame's proud hope, th' ethereal food Of restless energies, and only view'd By Him whose eye, from his eternal throne, Is on the soul's dark places; have subdued And vow'd themselves with strength till then unknown, To some high martyr-task, in secret and alone. XX Theirs be the bright and sacred names, enshrined Far in the bosom! for their deeds belong, Not to the gorgeous faith which charm'd mankind With its rich pomp of festival and song, Garland, and shrine, and incense-bearing throng; But to that Spirit, hallowing, as it tries Man's hidden soul in whispers, yet more strong Than storm or earthquake's voice; for thence arise All that mysterious world's unseen sublimities. XXI Well might thy name, brave Constantine! awake Such thought, such feeling!—But the scene again Bursts on my vision, as the day-beams break Through the red sulphurous mists: the camp, the plain, The terraced palaces, the dome-capt fane, With its bright cross fix'd high in crowning grace; Spears on the ramparts, galleys on the main, And, circling all with arms, that turban'd race, The sun, the desert, stamp'd in each dark haughty face. XXII Shout, ye seven hills! Lo! Christian pennons streaming Red o'er the waters! Hail, deliverers, hail! Along your billowy wake the radiance gleaming, Is Hope's own smile! They crowd the swelling sail, On, with the foam, the sunbeam and the gale, Borne, as a victor's car! The batteries pour Their clouds and thunders; but the rolling veil Of smoke floats up the exulting winds before! —And oh! the glorious burst of that bright sea and shore! XXIII The rocks, waves, ramparts, Europe's, Asia's coast, All throng'd! one theatre for kingly war! A monarch girt with his barbaric host, Points o'er the beach his flashing scymitar! Dark tribes are tossing javelins from afar, Hands waving banners o'er each battlement, Decks, with their serried guns, array'd to bar The promised aid: but hark! a shout is sent Up from the noble barks!—the Moslem line is rent! XXIV On, on through rushing flame, and arrowy shower, The welcome prows have cleft their rapid way; And, with the shadows of the vesper hour, Furl'd their white sails, and anchor'd in the bay. Then were the streets with song and torch-fire gay, Then the Greek wines flow'd mantling in the light Of festal halls—and there was joy!—the ray Of dying eyes, a moment wildly bright, The sunset of the soul, ere lost to mortal sight! XXV For vain that feeble succour! Day by day Th' imperial towers are crumbling, and the sweep Of the vast engines, in their ceaseless play, Comes powerful, as when Heaven unbinds the deep! —Man's heart is mightier than the castled steep, Yet will it sink when earthly hope is fled; Man's thoughts work darkly in such hours, and sleep Flies far; and in their mien, the walls who tread, Things by the brave untold, may fearfully be read! XXVI It was a sad and solemn task, to hold Their midnight-watch on that beleaguer'd wall! As the sea-wave beneath the bastions roll'd, A sound of fate was in its rise and fall; The heavy clouds were as an empire's pall, The giant-shadows of each tower and fane Lay like the grave's; a low mysterious call Breathed in the wind, and, from the tented plain, A voice of omens rose with each wild martial strain. XXVII For they might catch the Arab chargers neighing, The Thracian drum, the Tartar's drowsy song; Might almost hear the soldan's banner swaying, The watch-word mutter'd in some eastern tongue. Then flash'd the gun's terrific light along The marble streets, all stillness—not repose; And boding thoughts came o'er them, dark and strong; For heaven, earth, air, speak auguries to those Who see their number'd hours fast pressing to the close. XXVIII But strength is from the mightiest! There is one Still in the breach, and on the rampart seen, Whose cheek shows paler with each morning sun, And tells in silence, how the night hath been, In kingly halls, a vigil: yet serene The ray set deep within his thoughtful eye; And there is that in his collected mien, To which the hearts of noble men reply, With fires, partaking not this frame's mortality! XXIX Yes! call it not of lofty minds the fate, To pass o'er earth in brightness, but alone; High power was made their birthright, to create A thousand thoughts responsive to their own! A thousand echoes of their spirit's tone Start into life, where'er their path may be, Still following fast; as when the wind hath blown O'er Indian groves, a wanderer wild and free, Kindling and bearing flames afar from tree to tree! XXX And it is thus with thee! thy lot is cast On evil days, thou Cæsar! yet the few That set their generous bosom to the blast Which rocks thy throne—the fearless and the true, Bear hearts wherein thy glance can still renew The free devotion of the years gone by, When from bright dreams th' ascendant Roman drew Enduring strength! States vanish—ages fly— But leave one task unchanged—to suffer and to die! XXXI These are our nature's heritage. But thou, The crown'd with empire! thou wert call'd to share A cup more bitter. On thy fever'd brow The semblance of that buoyant hope to wear, Which long had pass'd away; alone to bear The rush and pressure of dark thoughts, that came As a strong billow in their weight of care; And, with all this, to smile! for earth-born frame These are stern conflicts, yet they pass, unknown to fame! XXXII Her glance is on the triumph, on the field, On the red scaffold; and where'er, in sight Of human eyes, the human soul is steel'd To deeds that seem as of immortal might, Yet are proud nature's! But her meteor-light Can pierce no depths, no clouds; it falls not where In silence, and in secret, and in night, The noble heart doth wrestle with despair, And rise more strong than death from its unwitness'd prayer. XXXIII Men have been firm in battle: they have stood With a prevailing hope on ravaged plains, And won the birthright of their hearths with blood, And died rejoicing, 'midst their ancient fanes, That so their children, undefiled with chains, Might worship there in peace. But they that stand When not a beacon o'er the wave remains, Link'd but to perish with a ruin'd land, Where Freedom dies with them—call these a martyr-band! XXXIV But the world heeds them not. Or if, perchance, Upon their strife it bend a careless eye, It is but as the Roman's stoic glance Fell on that stage where man's last agony Was made his sport, who, knowing one must die, Reck'd not which champion; but prepared the strain, And bound the bloody wreath of victory, To greet the conqueror; while, with calm disdain, The vanquish'd proudly met the doom he met in vain. XXXV The hour of Fate comes on! and it is fraught With this of Liberty, that now the need Is past to veil the brow of anxious thought, And clothe the heart, which still beneath must bleed, With Hope's fair-seeming drapery. We are freed From tasks like these by misery; one alone Is left the brave, and rest shall be thy meed, Prince, watcher, wearied one! when thou hast shown How brief the cloudy space which parts the grave and throne. XXXVI The signs are full. They are not in the sky, Nor in the many voices of the air, Nor the swift clouds. No fiery hosts on high Toss their wild spears: no meteor-banners glare, No comet fiercely shakes its blazing hair; And yet the signs are full: too truly seen In the thinn'd ramparts, in the pale despair Which lends one language to a people's mien, And in the ruin'd heaps where walls and towers have been! XXXVII It is a night of beauty: such a night As, from the sparry grot or laurel-shade, Or wave in marbled cavern rippling bright, Might woo the nymphs of Grecian fount and glade To sport beneath its moonbeams, which pervade Their forest-haunts; a night, to rove alone Where the young leaves by vernal winds are sway'd, And the reeds whisper, with a dreamy tone Of melody, that seems to breathe from worlds unknown; XXXVIII A night, to call from green Elysium's bowers The shades of elder bards; a night, to hold Unseen communion with th' inspiring powers That made deep groves their dwelling-place of old; A night, for mourners, o'er the hallow'd mould, To strew sweet flowers; for revellers to fill And wreath the cup; for sorrows to be told Which love hath cherish'd long—vain thoughts! be still! It is a night of fate, stamp'd with Almighty Will! XXXIX It should come sweeping in the storm, and rending The ancient summits in its dread career! And with vast billows wrathfully contending, And with dark clouds o'ershadowing every sphere! But He, whose footstep shakes the earth with fear, Passing to lay the sovereign cities low Alike in His omnipotence is near, When the soft winds o'er spring's green pathway blow, And when His thunders cleave the monarch-mountain's brow. XL The heavens in still magnificence look down On the hush'd Bosphorus, whose ocean-stream Sleeps, with its paler stars: the snowy crown Of far Olympus, in the moonlight-gleam Towers radiantly, as when the Pagan's dream Throng'd it with gods, and bent th' adoring knee! —But that is past—and now the One Supreme Fills not alone those haunts; but earth, air, sea, And Time, which presses on, to finish his decree. XLI Olympus, Ida, Delphi! ye, the thrones And temples of a visionary might, Brooding in clouds above your forest-zones, And mantling thence the realms beneath with night: Ye have look'd down on battles! Fear, and Flight, And arm'd Revenge, all hurrying past below! But there is yet a more appalling sight For earth prepared, than e'er, with tranquil brow, Ye gazed on from your world of solitude and snow! XLII Last night a sound was in the Moslem camp, And Asia's hills re-echoed to a cry Of savage mirth!—Wild horn, and war-steeds' tramp, Blent with the shout of barbarous revelry, The clash of desert-spears! Last night the sky A hue of menace and of wrath put on, Caught from red watch-fires, blazing far and high, And countless, as the flames, in ages gone, Streaming to heaven's bright queen from shadowy Lebanon! XLIII But all is stillness now. May this be sleep Which wraps those eastern thousands? Yes, perchance Along yon moonlit shore and dark-blue deep, Bright are their visions with the Houri's glance, And they behold the sparkling fountains dance Beneath the bowers of paradise, that shed Rich odours o'er the faithful; but the lance, The bow, the spear, now round the slumberers spread, Ere Fate fulfil such dreams, must rest beside the dead. XLIV May this be sleep, this hush?—A sleepless eye Doth hold its vigil 'midst that dusky race! One that would scan th' abyss of destiny, E'en now is gazing on the skies, to trace, In those bright worlds, the burning isles of space, Fate's mystic pathway: they the while, serene, Walk in their beauty; but Mohammed's face Kindles beneath their aspect, and his mien, All fired with stormy joy, by that soft light is seen. XLV Oh! wild presumption of a conqueror's dream, To gaze on those pure altar-fires, enshrined In depths of blue infinitude, and deem They shine to guide the spoiler of mankind O'er fields of blood!—But with the restless mind It hath been ever thus! and they that weep For worlds to conquer, o'er the bounds assign'd To human search, in daring pride would sweep, As o'er the trampled dust wherein they soon must sleep. XLVI But ye! that beam'd on Fate's tremendous night, When the storm burst o'er golden Babylon, And ye, that sparkled with your wonted light O'er burning Salem, by the Roman won; And ye, that calmly view'd the slaughter done In Rome's own streets, when Alaric's trumpet-blast Rung through the Capitol; bright spheres! roll on! Still bright, though empires fall; and bid man cast His humbled eyes to earth, and commune with the past. XLVII For it hath mighty lessons! from the tomb, And from the ruins of the tomb, and where, 'Midst the wreck'd cities in the desert's gloom, All tameless creatures make their savage lair, Thence comes its voice, that shakes the midnight air, And calls up clouds to dim the laughing day, And thrills the soul;—yet bids us not despair, But make one rock our shelter and our stay, Beneath whose shade all else is passing to decay! XLVIII The hours move on. I see a wavering gleam O'er the hush'd waters tremulously fall, Pour'd from the Cæsar's palace: now the beam Of many lamps is brightening in the hall, And from its long arcades and pillars tall Soft graceful shadows undulating lie On the wave's heaving bosom, and recall A thought of Venice, with her moonlight sky, And festal seas and domes, and fairy pageantry. XLIX But from that dwelling floats no mirthful sound! The swell of flute and Grecian lyre no more, Wafting an atmosphere of music round, Tells the hush'd seaman, gliding past the shore, How monarchs revel there!—Its feasts are o'er— Why gleam the lights along its colonnade? —I see a train of guests in silence pour Through its long avenues of terraced shade, Whose stately founts and bowers for joy alone were made! L In silence, and in arms!—With helm — with sword— These are no marriage-garments!—Yet e'en now Thy nuptial feast should grace the regal board, Thy Georgian bride should wreath her lovely brow With an imperial diadem!—but thou, O fated prince! art call'd, and these with thee, To darker scenes; and thou hast learn'd to bow Thine Eastern sceptre to the dread decree, And count it joy enough to perish—being free! LI On through long vestibules, with solemn tread, As men, that in some time of fear and wo, Bear darkly to their rest the noble dead, O'er whom by day their sorrows may not flow, The warriors pass: their measured steps are slow, And hollow echoes fill the marble halls, Whose long-drawn vistas open as they go In desolate pomp; and from the pictured walls, Sad seems the light itself which on their armour falls! LII And they have reach'd a gorgeous chamber, bright With all we dream of splendour; yet a gloom Seems gather'd o'er it to the boding sight, A shadow that anticipates the tomb! Still from its fretted roof the lamps illume A purple canopy, a golden throne; But it is empty!—Hath the stroke of doom Fallen there already?—Where is He, the One, Born that high seat to fill, supremely and alone? LIII Oh! there are times whose pressure doth efface Earth's vain distinctions!—when the storm beats loud, When the strong towers are tottering to their base, And the streets rock,—who mingle in the crowd? —Peasant and chief, the lowly and the proud, Are in that throng!—Yes, life hath many an hour Which makes us kindred, by one chast'ning bow'd, And feeling but, as from the storm we cower, What shrinking weakness feels before unbounded power! LIV Yet then that Power, whose dwelling is on high, Its loftiest marvels doth reveal, and speak, In the deep human heart more gloriously, Than in the bursting thunder!—Thence the weak, They that seem'd form'd, as flower-stems, but to break With the first wind, have risen to deeds, whose name Still calls up thoughts that mantle to the cheek, And thrill the pulse!—Ay, strength no pangs could tame Hath look'd from woman's eye upon the sword and flame! LV And this is of such hours!—That throne is void, And its lord comes uncrown'd. Behold him stand, With a calm brow, where woes have not destroy'd The Greek's heroic beauty, 'midst his band, The gather'd virtue of a sinking land. Alas! how scanty!—Now is cast aside All form of princely state; each noble hand Is press'd by turns in his: for earthly pride There is no room in hearts where earthly hope hath died! LVI A moment's hush—and then he speaks—he speaks! But not of hope! that dream hath long gone by: His words are full of memory—as he seeks, By the strong names of Rome and Liberty, Which yet are living powers that fire the eye, And rouse the heart of manhood; and by all The sad yet grand remembrances that lie Deep with earth's buried heroes; to recall The soul of other years, if but to grace their fall! LVII His words are full of faith!—And thoughts, more high Than Rome e'er knew, now fill his glance with light; Thoughts which give nobler lessons how to die Than e'er were drawn from Nature's haughty might! And to that eye, with all the spirit bright, Have theirs replied in tears, which may not shame The bravest in such moments!—'Tis a sight To make all earthly splendours cold and tame, —That generous burst of soul, with its electric flame! LVIII They weep—those champions of the Cross—they weep, Yet vow themselves to death!—Ay, 'midst that train Are martyrs, privileged in tears to steep Their lofty sacrifice!—The pang is vain, And yet its gush of sorrow shall not stain A warrior's sword.—Those men are strangers here— The homes they never may behold again, Lie far away, with all things blest and dear, On laughing shores, to which their barks no more shall steer! LIX Know'st thou the land where bloom the orange bowers? Where, through dark foliage, gleam the citron's dyes? —It is their own. They see their fathers' towers, 'Midst its Hesperian groves in sunlight rise: They meet in soul, the bright Italian eyes, Which long and vainly shall explore the main For their white sails' return: the melodies Of that sweet land are floating o'er their brain— Oh! what a crowded world one moment may contain! LX Such moments come to thousands!—few may die Amidst their native shades. The young, the brave, The beautiful, whose gladdening voice and eye Made summer in a parent's heart, and gave Light to their peopled homes; o'er land and wave Are scatter'd fast and far, as rose-leaves fall From the deserted stem. They find a grave Far from the shadow of th' ancestral hall, A lonely bed is theirs, whose smiles were hope to all! LXI But life flows on, and bears us with its tide, Nor may we, lingering, by the slumberers dwell, Though they were those once blooming at our side In youth's gay home!—Away! what sound's deep swell Comes on the wind?—It is an empire's knell, Slow, sad, majestic, pealing through the night! For the last time speaks forth the solemn bell, Which calls the Christians to their holiest rite, With a funereal voice of solitary might. LXII Again, and yet again!—A startling power In sounds like these lives ever; for they bear, Full on remembrance, each eventful hour, Chequering life's crowded path. They fill the air When conquerors pass, and fearful cities wear A mien like joy's; and when young brides are led From their paternal homes; and when the glare Of burning streets on midnight's cloud waves red, And when the silent house receives its guest—the dead. LXIII But to those tones what thrilling soul was given, On that last night of empire!—As a spell Whereby the life-blood to its source is driven, On the chill'd heart of multitudes they fell. Each cadence seem'd a prophecy, to tell Of sceptres passing from their line away, An angel-watcher's long and sad farewell, The requiem of a faith's departing sway, A throne's, a nation's dirge, a wail for earth's decay. LXIV Again, and yet again!—from yon high dome, Still the slow peal comes awfully; and they Who never more, to rest in mortal home, Shall throw the breastplate off at fall of day, Th' imperial band, in close and arm'd array, As men that from the sword must part no more, Take through the midnight streets their silent way, Within their ancient temple to adore, Ere yet its thousand years of Christian pomp are o'er. LXV It is the hour of sleep: yet few the eyes O'er which forgetfulness her balm hath shed In the beleaguer'd city. Stillness lies With moonlight, o'er the hills and waters spread, But not the less, with signs and sounds of dread, The time speeds on. No voice is raised to greet The last brave Constantine; and yet the tread Of many steps is in the echoing street, And pressure of pale crowds, scarce conscious why they meet. LXVI Their homes are luxury's yet: why pour they thence With a dim terror in each restless eye? Hath the dread car which bears the pestilence, In darkness, with its heavy wheels roll'd by, And rock'd their palaces, as if on high The whirlwind pass'd?—From couch and joyous board Hath the fierce phantom beckon'd them to die? —No!—what are these?—for them a cup is pour'd More dark with wrath;—Man comes—the spoiler and the sword. LXVII Still, as the monarch and his chieftains pass Through those pale throngs, the streaming torchlight throws On some wild form, amidst the living mass, Hues, deeply red like lava's, which disclose What countless shapes are worn by mortal woes! Lips bloodless, quivering limbs, hands clasp'd in prayer, Starts, tremblings, hurryings, tears; all outward shows Betokening inward agonies, were there: —Greeks! Romans! all but such as image brave despair! LXVIII But high above that scene, in bright repose, And beauty borrowing from the torches' gleams A mien of life, yet where no life-blood flows, But all instinct with loftier being seems, Pale, grand, colossal; lo! th' embodied dreams Of yore!—Gods, heroes, bards, in marble wrought, Look down, as powers, upon the wild extremes Of mortal passion!—Yet 'twas man that caught, And in each glorious form enshrined immortal thought! LXIX Stood ye not thus amidst the streets of Rome? That Rome which witness'd, in her sceptred days, So much of noble death?—When shrine and dome, 'Midst clouds of incense, rung with choral lays, As the long triumph pass'd, with all its blaze Of regal spoil, were ye not proudly borne, O sovereign forms! concent'ring all the rays Of the soul's lightnings?—did ye not adorn The pomp which earth stood still to gaze on, and to mourn? LXX Hath it been thus?—Or did ye grace the halls, Once peopled by the mighty?—Haply there, In your still grandeur, from the pillar'd walls Serene ye smiled on banquets of despair, Where hopeless courage wrought itself to dare The stroke of its deliverance, 'midst the glow Of living wreaths, the sighs of perfumed air, The sound of lyres, the flower-crown'd goblet's flow: —Behold again!—high hearts make nobler offerings now! LXXI The stately fane is reach'd—and at its gate The warriors pause; on life's tumultuous tide A stillness falls, while he whom regal state Hath mark'd from all, to be more sternly tried By suffering, speaks:—each ruder voice hath died, While his implores forgiveness!—“If there be One 'midst your throngs, my people! whom, in pride Or passion, I have wrong'd; such pardon, free As mortals hope from Heaven, accord that man to me!” LXXII But all is silence; and a gush of tears Alone replies!—He hath not been of those Who, fear'd by many, pine in secret fears Of all; th' environ'd but by slaves and foes, To whom day brings not safety, night repose, For they have heard the voice cry, “Sleep no more!” Of them he hath not been, nor such as close Their hearts to misery, till the time is o'er, When it speaks low and kneels th' oppressor's throne before! LXXIII He hath been loved—but who may trust the love Of a degenerate race?—in other mould Are cast the free and lofty hearts, that prove Their faith through fiery trials.—Yet behold, And call him not forsaken!—Thoughts untold Have lent his aspect calmness, and his tread Moves firmly to the shrine.—What pomps unfold Within its precincts!—Isles and seas have shed Their gorgeous treasures there, around th' imperial dead. LXXIV 'Tis a proud vision—that most regal pile Of ancient days!—The lamps are streaming bright From its rich altar, down each pillar'd aisle, Whose vista fades in dimness; but the sight Is lost in splendours, as the wavering light Developes, on those walls, the thousand dyes Of the vein'd marbles, which array their height, And from yon dome, the lode-star of all eyes, Pour such an iris-glow as emulates the skies. LXXV But gaze thou not on these; though heaven's own hues, In their soft clouds and radiant tracery vie; Though tints, of sun-born glory, may suffuse Arch, column, rich mosaic: pass thou by The stately tombs, where eastern Cæsars lie, Beneath their trophies; pause not here; for know, A deeper source of all sublimity Lives in man's bosom, than the world can show, In nature or in art—above, around, below. LXXVI Turn thou to mark (though tears may dim thy gaze) The steel-clad group before yon altar-stone: Heed not though gems and gold around it blaze; Those heads unhelm'd, those kneeling forms alone, Thus bow'd, look glorious here. The light is thrown Full from the shrine on one, a nation's lord, A sufferer!—but his task shall soon be done— E'en now, as Faith's mysterious cup is pour'd, See to that noble brow, peace, not of earth, restored! LXXVII The rite is o'er. The band of brethren part, Once—and but once—to meet on earth again! Each, in the strength of a collected heart, To dare what man may dare—and know 'tis vain! The rite is o'er: and thou, majestic fane!— The glory is departed from thy brow!— Be clothed with dust!—the Christian's farewell strain Hath died within thy walls; thy Cross must bow; Thy kingly tombs be spoil'd; thy golden shrines laid low! LXXVIII The streets grow still and lonely—and the star, The last bright lingerer in the path of morn, Gleams faint; and in the very lap of war, As if young Hope with twilight's ray were born, Awhile the city sleeps:—her throngs, o'erworn With fears and watchings, to their homes retire; Nor is the balmy air of dayspring torn With battle-sounds; the winds in sighs expire, And quiet broods in mists that veil the sunbeam's fire. LXXIX The city sleeps!—ay! on the combat's eve, And by the scaffold's brink, and 'midst the swell Of angry seas, hath Nature won reprieve Thus from her cares. The brave have slumber'd well, And e'en the fearful, in their dungeon-cell, Chain'd between life and death!—Such rest be thine, For conflicts wait thee still!—Yet who can tell In that brief hour, how much of heaven may shine Full on thy spirit's dream?—Sleep, weary Constantine! LXXX Doth the blast rise?—the clouded east is red, As if a storm were gathering; and I hear What seems like heavy rain-drops, or the tread, The soft and smother'd step of those that fear Surprise from ambush'd foes. Hark! yet more near It comes, a many-toned and mingled sound; A rustling, as of winds, where boughs are sear, A rolling, as of wheels that shake the ground From far; a heavy rush, like seas that burst their bound! LXXXI Wake, wake! They come from sea and shore, ascending In hosts your ramparts! Arm ye for the day! Who now may sleep amidst the thunders rending, Through tower and wall, a path for their array? Hark! how the trumpet cheers them to the prey, With its wild voice, to which the seas reply, And the earth rocks beneath their engines' sway, And the far hills repeat their battle-cry, Till that fierce tumult seems to shake the vaulted sky! LXXXII They fail not now, the generous band, that long Have ranged their swords around a falling throne; Still in those fearless men the walls are strong, Hearts, such as rescue empires, are their own! —Shall those high energies be vainly shown? No! from their towers th' invading tide is driven Back, like the Red-sea waves, when God had blown With his strong winds!—the dark-brow'd ranks are riven— Shout, warriors of the cross!—for victory is of Heaven! LXXXIII Stand firm!—Again the crescent host is rushing, And the waves foam, as on the galleys sweep, With all their fires and darts, though blood is gushing Fast o'er their sides, as rivers to the deep. Stand firm!—there yet is hope, th' ascent is steep, And from on high no shaft descends in vain; —But those that fall swell up the mangled heap, In the red moat, the dying and the slain, And o'er that fearful bridge th' assailants mount again! LXXXIV Oh! the dread mingling, in that awful hour, Of all terrific sounds!—the savage tone Of the wild horn, the cannon's peal, the shower Of hissing darts, the crash of walls o'erthrown, The deep dull tambour's beat—man's voice alone Is there unheard! Ye may not catch the cry Of trampled thousands—prayer, and shriek, and moan, All drown'd, as that fierce hurricane sweeps by, But swell the unheeded sum earth pays for victory! LXXXV War-clouds have wrapt the city!—through their dun, O'erloaded canopy, at times a blaze, As of an angry storm-presaging sun, From the Greek fire shoots up; and lightning rays Flash, from the shock of sabres, through the haze, And glancing arrows cleave the dusky air! —Ay! this is in the compass of our gaze,— But fearful things, unknown, untold, are there, Workings of wrath and death, and anguish, and despair! LXXXVI Woe, shame and woe!—A chief, a warrior flies, A red-cross champion, bleeding, wild, and pale! —O God! that nature's passing agonies, Thus, o'er the spark which dies not, should prevail! Yes! rend the arrow from thy shatter'd mail, And stanch the blood-drops, Genoa's fallen son! Fly swifter yet! the javelins pour as hail! —But there are tortures which thou canst not shun, The spirit is their prey—thy pangs are but begun! LXXXVII Oh, happy in their homes, the noble dead! The seal is set on their majestic fame; Earth has drunk deep the generous blood they shed, Fate has no power to dim their stainless name! They may not, in one bitter moment, shame Long glorious years; from many a lofty stem Fall graceful flowers, and eagle-hearts grow tame, And stars drop, fading, from the diadem; But the bright past is theirs—there is no change for them! LXXXVIII Where art thou, Constantine?—where death is reaping His sevenfold harvest!—where the stormy light, Fast as th' artillery's thunderbolts are sweeping, Throws meteor-bursts o'er battle's noonday-night! Where the towers rock and crumble from their height, As to the earthquake, and the engines ply, Like red Vesuvio; and where human might Confronts all this, and still brave hearts beat high, While scymitars ring loud on shivering panoply. LXXXIX Where art thou, Constantine?—where Christian blood Hath bathed the walls in torrents, and in vain! Where faith and valour perish in the flood, Whose billows, rising o'er their bosoms, gain Dark strength each moment: where the gallant slain Around the banner of the cross lie strew'd, Thick as the vine-leaves on th' autumnal plain; Where all, save one high spirit, is subdued, And through the breach press on th' o'erwhelming multitude. XC Now is he battling 'midst a host alone, As the last cedar stems awhile the sway Of mountain-storms, whose fury hath o'erthrown Its forest-brethren in their green array! And he hath cast his purple robe away, With its imperial bearings; that his sword An iron ransom from the chain may pay, And win, what haply fate may yet accord, A soldier's death—the all now left an empire's lord! XCI Search for him now where bloodiest lie the files Which once were men, the faithful and the brave! Search for him now where loftiest rise the piles Of shatter'd helms and shields, which could not save; And crests and banners, never more to wave In the free winds of heaven! He is of those O'er whom the host may rush, the tempest rave, And the steeds trample, and the spearmen close, Yet wake them not!—so deep their long and last repose! XCII Woe to the vanquish'd!—thus it hath been still Since Time's first march!—Hark, hark, a people's cry! Ay, now the conquerors in the streets fulfil Their task of wrath! In vain the victims fly; Hark! now each piercing tone of agony Blends in the city's shriek! The lot is cast. Slaves, 'twas your choice thus, rather thus, to die, Than where the warrior's blood flows warm and fast, And roused and mighty hearts beat proudly to the last! XCIII Oh! well doth freedom battle! Men have made, E'en 'midst their blazing roofs, a noble stand, And on the floors, where once their children play'd, And by the hearths, round which their household band At evening met; ay, struggling hand to hand, Within the very chambers of their sleep, There have they taught the spoilers of the land, In chainless hearts what fiery strength lies deep, To guard free homes!—but ye!—kneel, tremblers! kneel, and weep! XCIV 'Tis eve—the storm hath died, the valiant rest Low on their shields; the day's fierce work is done, And blood-stain'd seas, and burning towers attest Its fearful deeds. An empire's race is run! Sad, 'midst his glory, looks the parting sun Upon the captive city. Hark! a swell (Meet to proclaim barbaric war-fields won) Of fierce triumphal sounds, that wildly tell The Soldan comes within the Cæsars' halls to dwell! XCV Yes! with the peal of cymbal and of gong, He comes,—the Moslem treads those ancient halls! But all is stillness there, as death had long Been lord alone within those gorgeous walls. And half that silence of the grave appals The conqueror's heart. Ay, thus with triumph's hour, Still comes the boding whisper, which recalls A thought of those impervious clouds that lower O'er grandeur's path, a sense of some far mightier Power! XCVI “The owl upon Afrasiab's towers hath sung Her watch-song, and around th' imperial throne The spider weaves his web!” Still darkly hung That verse of omen, as a prophet's tone, O'er his flush'd spirit. Years on years have flown To prove its truth: kings pile their domes in air, That the coil'd snake may bask on sculptured stone, And nations clear the forest, to prepare For the wild fox and wolf more stately dwellings there! XCVII But thou! that on thy ramparts proudly dying, As a crown'd leader in such hours should die, Upon thy pyre of shiver'd spears art lying, With the heavens o'er thee for a canopy, And banners for thy shroud! No tear, no sigh, Shall mingle with thy dirge; for thou art now Beyond vicissitude! Lo! rear'd on high, The Crescent blazes, while the Cross must bow; But where no change can reach, there, Constantine, art thou! XCVIII “After life's fitful fever thou sleep'st well!” We may not mourn thee! Sceptred chiefs, from whom The earth received her destiny, and fell Before them trembling—to a sterner doom Have oft been call'd. For them the dungeon's gloom, With its cold starless midnight, hath been made More fearful darkness, where, as in a tomb, Without a tomb's repose, the chain hath weigh'd Their very soul to dust, with each high power decay'd. XCIX Or in the eye of thousands they have stood, To meet the stroke of death; but not like thee! From bonds and scaffolds hath appeal'd their blood, But thou didst fall unfetter'd, arm'd, and free, And kingly to the last!—And if it be, That, from the viewless world, whose marvels none Return to tell, a spirit's eye can see The things of earth; still may'st thou hail the sun, Which o'er thy land shall dawn, when freedom's fight is won! C And the hour comes, in storm! A light is glancing Far through the forest-god's Arcadian shades! —'Tis not the moonbeam, tremulously dancing, Where lone Alpheus bathes his haunted glades; A murmur, gathering power, the air pervades, Round dark Cithæron, and by Delphi's steep; —'Tis not the song and lyre of Grecian maids, Nor pastoral reed that lulls the vales to sleep, Nor yet the rustling pines, nor yet the sounding deep! CI Arms glitter on the mountains, which, of old, Awoke to freedom's first heroic strain, And by the streams, once crimson, as they roll'd The Persian helm and standard to the main; And the blue waves of Salamis again Thrill to the trumpet; and the tombs reply, With their ten thousand echoes, from each plain, Far as Platæa's, where the mighty lie, Who crown'd so proudly there the bowl of liberty! CII Bright land, with glory mantled o'er by song! Land of the vision-peopled hills, and streams, And fountains, whose deserted banks along, Still the soft air with inspiration teems; Land of the graves, whose dwellers shall be themes To verse for ever; and of ruin'd shrines, That scarce look desolate beneath such beams, As bathe in gold thine ancient rocks and pines? —When shall thy sons repose in peace beneath their vines? CIII Thou wert not made for bonds, nor shame, nor fear! —Do the hoar oaks and dark-green laurels wave O'er Mantinea's earth?—doth Pindus rear His snows, the sunbeam, and the storm to brave? And is there yet on Marathon a grave? And doth Eurotas lead his silvery line By Sparta's ruins?—And shall man, a slave, Bow'd to the dust, amid such scenes repine? —If e'er a soil was mark'd for freedom's step—'tis thine! CIV Wash from that soil the stains, with battle-showers! —Beneath Sophia's dome the Moslem prays, The crescent gleams amidst the olive-bowers, In the Comneni's halls the Tartar sways: But not for long!—the spirit of those days, When the three hundred made their funeral pile Of Asia's dead, is kindling, like the rays Of thy rejoicing sun, when first his smile Warms the Parnassian rock, and gilds the Delian isle. CV If then 'tis given thee to arise in might, Trampling the scourge, and dashing down the chain, Pure be thy triumphs, as thy name is bright! The cross of victory should not know a stain! So may that faith once more supremely reign, Through which we lift our spirits from the dust! And deem not, e'en when virtue dies in vain, She dies forsaken; but repose our trust On Him whose ways are dark, unsearchable—but just. GREEK SONGS. I.—THE STORM OF DELPHI. See the account cited from Herodotus, in Mitford's Greece. Far through the Delphian shades An Eastern trumpet rung! And the startled eagle rush'd on high, With a sounding flight through the fiery sky; And banners, o'er the shadowy glades, To the sweeping winds were flung. Banners, with deep-red gold All waving as a flame, And a fitful glance from the bright spear-head On the dim wood-paths of the mountain shed, And a peal of Asia's war-notes told That in arms the Persian came. He came with starry gems On his quiver and his crest; With starry gems, at whose heart the day Of the cloudless orient burning lay, And they cast a gleam on the laurel-stems, As onward his thousands press'd. But a gloom fell o'er their way, And a heavy moan went by! A moan, yet not like the wind's low swell, When its voice grows wild amidst cave and dell, But a mortal murmur of dismay, Or a warrior's dying sigh! A gloom fell o'er their way! 'Twas not the shadow cast By the dark pine boughs, as they cross'd the blue Of the Grecian heavens with their solemn hue;— The air was fill'd with a mightier sway— But on the spearmen pass'd! And hollow to their tread, Came the echoes of the ground, And banners droop'd, as with dews o'erborne, And the wailing blast of the battle horn Had an alter'd cadence, dull and dead, Of strange foreboding sound. But they blew a louder strain, When the steep defiles were pass'd! And afar the crown'd Parnassus rose, To shine through heaven with his radiant snows, And in golden light the Delphian fane Before them stood at last! In golden light it stood, 'Midst the laurels gleaming lone, For the Sun-god yet, with a lovely smile, O'er its graceful pillars look'd awhile, Though the stormy shade on cliff and wood Grew deep round its mountain-throne. And the Persians gave a shout! But the marble-walls replied, With a clash of steel and a sullen roar Like heavy wheels on the ocean-shore, And a savage trumpet's note peal'd out, Till their hearts for terror died! On the armour of the god, Then a viewless hand was laid; There were helm and spear, with a clanging din, And corslet brought from the shrine within, From the inmost shrine of the dread abode, And before its front array'd. And a sudden silence fell Through the dim and loaded air! On the wild-bird's wing, and the myrtle spray, And the very founts, in their silvery way, With a weight of sleep came down the spell, Till man grew breathless there. But the pause was broken soon! 'Twas not by song or lyre; For the Delphian maids had left their bowers, And the hearths were lone in the city's towers, But there burst a sound through the misty noon— That battle-noon of fire! It burst from earth and heaven! It roll'd from crag and cloud! For a moment of the mountain-blast, With a thousand stormy voices pass'd, And the purple gloom of the sky was riven, When the thunder peal'd aloud. And the lightnings in their play Flash'd forth, like javelins thrown; Like sun-darts wing'd from the silver bow, They smote the spear and the turban'd brow, And the bright gems flew from the crests like spray, And the banners were struck down! And the massy oak-boughs crash'd To the fire-bolts from on high, And the forest lent its billowy roar, While the glorious tempest onward bore, And lit the streams, as they foam'd and dash'd, With the fierce rain sweeping by. Then rush'd the Delphian men On the pale and scatter'd host; Like the joyous burst of a flashing wave, They rush'd from the dim Corycian cave, And the singing blast o'er wood and glen Roll'd on, with the spears they toss'd. There were cries of wild dismay, There were shouts of warrior-glee, There were savage sounds of the tempest's mirth, That shook the realm of their eagle-birth; But the mount of song, when they died away, Still rose, with its temple, free! And the Pæan swell'd erelong, Io Pæan! from the fane; Io Pæan! for the war-array, On the crown'd Parnassus riven that day! —Thou shalt rise as free, thou mount of song! With thy bounding streams again. II.—THE BOWL OF LIBERTY. This and the following piece appeared originally in the New Monthly Magazine. Before the fiery sun, The sun that looks on Greece with cloudless eye, In the free air, and on the war-field won, Our fathers crown'd the Bowl of Liberty. Amidst the tombs they stood, The tombs of heroes! with the solemn skies, And the wide plain around, where patriot-blood Had steep'd the soil in hues of sacrifice. They call'd the glorious dead, In the strong faith which brings the viewless nigh, And pour'd rich odours o'er their battle-bed, And bade them to their rite of Liberty. They call'd them from the shades, The golden-fruited shades, where minstrels tell How softer light th' immortal clime pervades, And music floats o'er meads of Asphodel. Then fast the bright-red wine For an account of this ceremony, anciently performed in commemoration of the battle of Platæa, see Potter's Antiquities of Greece, vol. i. p. 389. Flow'd to their names who taught the world to die And made the land's green turf a living shrine, Meet for the wreath and Bowl of Liberty. So the rejoicing earth Took from her vines again the blood she gave, And richer flowers to deck the tomb drew birth From the free soil thus hallow'd to the brave. We have the battle-fields, The tombs, the names, the blue majestic sky, We have the founts the purple vintage yields; —When shall we crown the Bowl of Liberty? III.—THE VOICE OF SCIO. A voice from Scio's isle— A voice of song, a voice of old Swept far as cloud or billow roll'd, And earth was hush'd the while— The souls of nations woke! Where lies the land whose hills among, That voice of Victory hath not rung, As if a trumpet spoke? To sky, and sea, and shore, Of those whose blood, on Ilion's plain, Swept from the rivers to the main, A glorious tale it bore. Still, by our sun-bright deep, With all the fame that fiery lay Threw round them, in its rushing way, The sons of battle sleep. And kings their turf have crown'd! And pilgrims o'er the foaming wave Brought garlands there: so rest the brave, Who thus their bard have found! A voice from Scio's isle, A voice as deep hath risen again As far shall peal its thrilling strain, Where'er our sun may smile! Let not its tones expire! Such power to waken earth and heaven, And might and vengeance, ne'er was given To mortal song or lyre! Know ye not whence it comes? —From ruin'd hearths, from burning fanes, From kindred blood on yon red plains, From desolated homes! 'Tis with us through the night! 'Tis on our hills, 'tis in our sky— Hear it, ye heavens! when swords flash high, O'er the mid-waves of fight! IV.—THE SPARTANS' MARCH. Originally published in the Edinburgh Magazine. “The Spartans used not the trumpet in their march into battle,” says Thucydides, “because they wished not to excite the rage of their warriors. Their charging-step was made to the ‘Dorian mood of flutes and soft recorders.’ The valour of a Spartan was too highly tempered to require a stunning or a rousing impulse. His spirit was like a steed too proud for the spur.” Campbell on the Elegiac Poetry of the Greeks. 'Twas morn upon the Grecian hills, Where peasants dress'd the vines; Sunlight was on Cithæron's rills, Arcadia's rocks and pines. And brightly, through his reeds and flowers, Eurotas wander'd by, When a sound arose from Sparta's towers Of solemn harmony. Was it the hunters' choral strain To the woodland-goddess pour'd? Did virgin hands in Pallas' fane Strike the full sounding chord? But helms were glancing on the stream, Spears ranged in close array, And shields flung back a glorious beam To the morn of a fearful day! And the mountain-echoes of the land Swell'd through the deep-blue sky; While to soft strains moved forth a band Of men that moved to die. They march'd not with the trumpet's blast, Nor bade the horn peal out, And the laurel groves, as on they pass'd, Rung with no battle shout! They ask'd no clarion's voice to fire Their souls with an impulse high; But the Dorian reed and the Spartan lyre For the sons of liberty! And still sweet flutes, their path around Sent forth Æolian breath; They needed not a sterner sound To marshal them for death! So moved they calmly to their field, Thence never to return, Save bearing back the Spartan shield, Or on it proudly borne! V.—THE URN AND SWORD. They sought for treasures in the tomb, Where gentler hands were wont to spread Fresh boughs and flowers of purple bloom, And sunny ringlets, for the dead. See Potter's Grecian Antiquities, vol. ii. p. 234. They scatter'd far the greensward heap, Where once those hands the bright wine pour'd; —What found they in the home of sleep?— A mouldering urn, a shiver'd sword! An urn, which held the dust of one Who died when hearths and shrines were free; A sword, whose work was proudly done Between our mountains and the sea. And these are treasures!—undismay'd, Still for the suffering land we trust, Wherein the past its fame hath laid, With freedom's sword, and valour's dust. VI.—THE MYRTLE BOUGH. Still green, along our sunny shore, The flowering myrtle waves, As when its fragrant boughs of yore Were offer'd on the graves— The graves, wherein our mighty men Had rest, unviolated then. Still green it waves! as when the hearth Was sacred through the land; And fearless was the banquet's mirth, And free the minstrel's hand; And guests, with shining myrtle crown'd, Sent the wreath'd lyre and wine-cup round. Still green! as when on holy ground The tyrant's blood was pour'd: Forget ye not what garlands bound The young deliverer's sword! Though earth may shroud Harmodius now, We still have sword and myrtle bougn! ELYSIUM. “In the Elysium of the ancients, we find none but heroes and persons who had either been fortunate or distinguished on earth; the children, and apparently the slaves and lower classes, that is to say, Poverty, Misfortune, and Innocence, were banished to the infernal Regions.” Chateaubriand, Génie du Christianisme. Fair wert thou in the dreams Of elder time, thou land of glorious flowers And summer winds and low-toned silvery streams, Dim with the shadows of thy laurel bowers, Where, as they pass'd, bright hours Left no faint sense of parting, such as clings To earthly love, and joy in loveliest things! Fair wert thou, with the light On thy blue hills and sleepy waters cast, From purple skies ne'er deep'ning into night, Yet soft, as if each moment were their last Of glory, fading fast Along the mountains!—but thy golden day Was not as those that warn us of decay. And ever, through thy shades, A swell of deep Æolian sound went by, From fountain-voices in their secret glades, And low reed-whispers, making sweet reply To summer's breezy sigh, And young leaves trembling to the wind's light breath, Which ne'er had touch'd them with a hue of death! And the transparent sky Rung as a dome, all thrilling to the strain Of harps that, 'midst the woods, made harmony Solemn and sweet; yet troubling not the brain With dreams and yearnings vain, And dim remembrances, that still draw birth From the bewild'ring music of the earth. And who, with silent tread, Moved o'er the plains of waving asphodel? Call'd from the dim procession of the dead, Who, 'midst the shadowy amaranth-bowers might dwell, And listen to the swell Of those majestic hymn-notes, and inhale The spirit wand'ring in the immortal gale? They of the sword, whose praise, With the bright wine at nations' feasts, went round! They of the lyre, whose unforgotten lays Forth on the winds had sent their mighty sound, And in all regions found Their echoes 'midst the mountains!—and become In man's deep heart as voices of his home! They of the daring thought! Daring and powerful, yet to dust allied— Whose flight through stars, and seas, and depths, had sought The soul's far birthplace—but without a guide! Sages and seers, who died, And left the world their high mysterious dreams, Born 'midst the olive woods, by Grecian streams. But the most loved are they Of whom fame speaks not with her clarion voice, In regal halls!—the shades o'erhang their way, The vale, with its deep fountains, is their choice, And gentle hearts rejoice Around their steps; till silently they die, As a stream shrinks from summer's burning eye. And these—of whose abode, 'Midst her green valleys, earth retain'd no trace, Save a flower springing from their burial-sod, A shade of sadness on some kindred face, A dim and vacant place In some sweet home;—thou hadst no wreaths for these, Thou sunny land! with all thy deathless trees! The peasant at his door Might sink to die when vintage feasts were spread, And songs on every wind! From thy bright shore No lovelier vision floated round his head— Thou wert for nobler dead! He heard the bounding steps which round him fell, And sigh'd to bid the festal sun farewell! The slave, whose very tears Were a forbidden luxury, and whose breast Kept the mute woes and burning thoughts of years, As embers in a burial-urn compress'd; He might not be thy guest! No gentle breathings from thy distant sky Came o'er his path, and whisper'd “Liberty!” Calm, on its leaf-strewn bier, Unlike a gift of Nature to Decay, Too rose-like still, too beautiful, too dear, The child at rest before the mother lay, E'en so to pass away, With its bright smile!—Elysium! what wert thou To her, who wept o'er that young slumb'rer's brow? Thou hadst no home, green land! For the fair creature from her bosom gone, With life's fresh flowers just opening in its hand, And all the lovely thoughts and dreams unknown Which, in its clear eye, shone Like spring's first wakening! but that light was past— Where went the dewdrop swept before the blast? Not where thy soft winds play'd, Not where thy waters lay in glassy sleep! Fade with thy bowers, thou Land of Visions, fade! From thee no voice came o'er the gloomy deep, And bade man cease to weep! Fade, with the amaranth plain, the myrtle grove, Which could not yield one hope to sorrowing love! THE FUNERAL GENIUS; AN ANCIENT STATUE. “Debout, couronné de fleurs, les bras élevés et posés sur sa tête, et le dos appuyé contre un pin, ce génie semble exprimer par son attitude le répos des morts. Les bas-reliefs des tombeaux offrent souvent des figures semblables.”—Visconti, Description des Antiques du Musée Royal. Thou shouldst be look'd on when the starlight falls Through the blue stillness of the summer-air, Not by the torch-fire wavering on the walls— It hath too fitful and too wild a glare! And thou!—thy rest, the soft, the lovely, seems To ask light steps, that will not break its dreams. Flowers are upon thy brow; for so the dead Were crown'd of old, with pale spring flowers like these: Sleep on thine eye hath sunk; yet softly shed, As from the wing of some faint southern breeze: And the pine-boughs o'ershadow thee with gloom Which of the grove seems breathing—not the tomb. They fear'd not death, whose calm and gracious thought Of the last hour, hath settled thus in thee! They who thy wreath of pallid roses wrought, And laid thy head against the forest tree, As that of one, by music's dreamy close, On the wood-violets lull'd to deep repose. They fear'd not death!—yet who shall say his touch Thus lightly falls on gentle things and fair? Doth he bestow, or will he leave so much Of tender beauty as thy features wear? Thou sleeper of the bower! on whose young eyes So still a night, a night of summer, lies! Had they seen aught like thee?—Did some fair boy Thus, with his graceful hair, before them rest? —His graceful hair, no more to wave in joy, But drooping, as with heavy dews oppress'd: And his eye veil'd so softly by its fringe, And his lip faded to the white-rose tinge? Oh! happy, if to them the one dread hour Made known its lessons from a brow like thine! If all their knowledge of the spoiler's power Came by a look so tranquilly divine! —Let him, who thus hath seen the lovely part, Hold well that image to his thoughtful heart! But thou, fair slumberer! was there less of woe, Or love, or terror, in the days of old, That men pour'd out their gladdening spirit's flow, Like sunshine, on the desolate and cold, And gave thy semblance to the shadowy king, Who for deep souls had then a deeper sting? In the dark bosom of the earth they laid Far more than we—for loftier faith is ours! Their gems were lost in ashes—yet they made The grave a place of beauty and of flowers, With fragrant wreaths, and summer boughs array'd, And lovely sculpture gleaming through the shade. Is it for us a darker gloom to shed O'er its dim precincts?—do we not intrust But for a time, its chambers with our dead, And strew immortal seed upon the dust? —Why should we dwell on that which lies beneath, When living light hath touch'd the brow of death? THE TOMBS OF PLATÆA. FROM A PAINTING BY WILLIAMS. And there they sleep!—the men who stood In arms before th' exulting sun, And bathed their spears in Persian blood, And taught the earth how freedom might be won. They sleep!—th' Olympic wreaths are dead, Th' Athenian lyres are hush'd and gone; The Dorian voice of song is fled— Slumber, ye mighty! slumber deeply on. They sleep, and seems not all around As hallow'd unto glory's tomb? Silence is on the battle ground, The heavens are loaded with a breathless gloom. And stars are watching on their height, But dimly seen through mist and cloud, And still and solemn is the light Which folds the plain, as with a glimmering shroud. And thou, pale night-queen! here thy beams Are not as those the shepherd loves, Nor look they down on shining streams, By Naiads haunted in their laurel groves: Thou seest no pastoral hamlet sleep, In shadowy quiet, 'midst its vines No temple gleaming from the steep, 'Midst the grey olives, or the mountain pines: But o'er a dim and boundless waste, Thy rays, e'en like a tomb-lamp's, brood, Where man's departed steps are traced But by his dust, amidst the solitude. And be it thus!—What slave shall tread O'er freedom's ancient battle-plains? Let deserts wrap the glorious dead, When their bright Land sits weeping o'er her chains: Here, where the Persian clarion rung, And where the Spartan sword flash'd high, And where the pæan strains were sung, From year to year swell'd on by liberty! Here should no voice, no sound, be heard, Until the bonds of Greece be riven, Save of the leader's charging word, Or the shrill trumpet, pealing up through heaven! Rest in your silent homes, ye brave! No vines festoon your lonely tree! A single tree appears in Mr Williams's impressive picture. No harvest o'er your war-field wave, Till rushing winds proclaim—the land is free! THE VIEW FROM CASTRI. FROM A PAINTING BY WILLIAMS. There have been bright and glorious pageants here, Where now grey stones and moss-grown columns lie; There have been words, which earth grew pale to hear, Breath'd from the cavern's misty chambers nigh: There have been voices, through the sunny sky, And the pine-woods, their choral hymn-notes sending, And reeds and lyres, their Dorian melody, With incense-clouds around the temple blending, And throngs with laurel-boughs, before the altar bending. There have been treasures of the seas and isles Brought to the day-god's now-forsaken throne; Thunders have peal'd along the rock-defiles, When the far-echoing battle-horn made known That foes were on their way!—the deep-wind's moan Hath chill'd th' invader's heart with secret fear, And from the Sybil-grottoes, wild and lone, Storms have gone forth, which, in their fierce career, From his bold hand have struck the banner and the spear. The shrine hath sunk!—but thou unchanged art there! Mount of the voice and vision, robed with dreams! Unchanged, and rushing through the radiant air, With thy dark waving pines, and flashing streams, And all thy founts of song! their bright course teems With inspiration yet; and each dim haze, Or golden cloud which floats around thee, seems As with its mantle veiling from our gaze The mysteries of the past, the gods of elder days! Away, vain phantasies!—doth less of power Dwell round thy summit, or thy cliffs invest, Though in deep stillness now, the ruin's flower Wave o'er the pillars mouldering on thy breast? —Lift through the free blue heavens thine arrowy crest! Let the great rocks their solitude regain! No Delphian lyres now break thy noontide rest With their full chords:—but silent be the strain! Thou hast a mightier voice to speak th' Eternal's reign! This, with the preceding, and several of the following pieces, first appeared in the Edinburgh Magazine. THE FESTAL HOUR. When are the lessons given That shake the startled earth? When wakes the foe While the friend sleeps! When falls the traitor's blow? When are proud sceptres riven, High hopes o'erthrown?—It is when lands rejoice, When cities blaze and lift th' exulting voice, And wave their banners to the kindling heaven! Fear ye the festal hour! When mirth o'erflows, then tremble!—'Twas a night Of gorgeous revel, wreaths, and dance, and light, When through the regal bower The trumpet peal'd, ere yet the song was done, And there were shrieks in golden Babylon, And trampling armies, ruthless in their power. The marble shrines were crown'd: Young voices, through the blue Athenian sky, And Dorian reeds, made summer-melody, And censers waved around; And lyres were strung and bright libations pour'd! When, through the streets, flash'd out th' avenging sword, Fearless and free, the sword with myrtles bound! The sword of Harmodius. Through Rome a triumph pass'd. Rich in her sun-god's mantling beams went by That long array of glorious pageantry, With shout and trumpet-blast. An empire's gems their starry splendour shed O'er the proud march; a king in chains was led; A stately victor, crown'd and robed, came last. Paulus Æmilius, one of whose sons died a few days before, and another shortly after, his triumph on the conquest of Macedon, when Perseus, king of that country, was led in chains. And many a Dryad's bower Had lent the laurels which, in waving play, Stirr'd the warm air, and glisten'd round his way, As a quick-flashing shower. —O'er his own porch, meantime, the cypress hung, Through his fair halls a cry of anguish rung— Woe for the dead!—the father's broken flower! A sound of lyre and song, In the still night, went floating o'er the Nile, Whose waves, by many an old mysterious pile, Swept with that voice along; And lamps were shining o'er the red wine's foam Where a chief revell'd in a monarch's dome, And fresh rose-garlands deck'd a glittering throng. 'Twas Antony that bade The joyous chords ring out!—but strains arose Of wilder omen at the banquet's close! Sounds, by no mortal made, See the description given by Plutarch, in his life of Antony, of the supernatural sounds heard in the streets of Alexandria, the night before Antony's death. Shook Alexandria through her streets that night, And pass'd—and with another sunset's light, The kingly Roman on his bier was laid. Bright 'midst its vineyards lay The fair Campanian city, Herculaneum, of which it is related, that all the inhabitants were assembled in the theatres, when the shower of ashes which covered the city descended. with its towers And temples gleaming through dark olive-bowers, Clear in the golden day; Joy was around it as the glowing sky, And crowds had fill'd its halls of revelry, And all the sunny air was music's way. A cloud came o'er the face Of Italy's rich heaven!—its crystal blue Was changed, and deepen'd to a wrathful hue Of night, o'ershadowing space, As with the wings of death!—in all his power Vesuvius woke, and hurl'd the burning shower, And who could tell the buried city's place? Such things have been of yore, In the gay regions where the citrons blow, And purple summers all their sleepy glow On the grape-clusters pour; And where the palms to spicy winds are waving, Along clear seas of melting sapphire, laving, As with a flow of light, their southern shore. Turn we to other climes!— Far in the Druid-Isle a feast was spread, 'Midst the rock-altars of the warrior dead: Stonehenge, said by some traditions to have been erected to the memory of Ambrosius, an early British king; and by others mentioned as a monumental record of the massacre of British chiefs here alluded to. And ancient battle-rhymes Were chanted to the harp; and yellow mead Went flowing round, and tales of martial deed, And lofty songs of Britain's elder time; But, ere the giant-fane Cast its broad shadows on the robe of even, Hush'd were the bards, and in the face of heaven, O'er that old burial-plain Flash'd the keen Saxon dagger!—Blood was streaming Where late the mead-cup to the sun was gleaming, And Britain's hearths were heap'd that night in vain— For they return'd no more! They that went forth at morn, with reckless heart, In that fierce banquet's mirth to bear their part; And, on the rushy floor, And the bright spears and bucklers of the walls, The high wood-fires were blazing in their halls; But not for them—they slept—their feast was o'er! Fear ye the festal hour! Ay, tremble when the cup of joy o'erflows! Tame down the swelling heart!—the bridal rose, And the rich myrtle's flower Have veil'd the sword!—Red wines have sparkled fast From venom'd goblets, and soft breezes pass'd, With fatal perfume, through the revel's bower. Twine the young glowing wreath! But pour not all your spirit in the song, Which through the sky's deep azure floats along, Like summer's quickening breath! The ground is hollow in the path of mirth: Oh! far too daring seems the joy of earth, So darkly press'd and girdled in by death! SONG OF THE BATTLE OF MORGARTEN. The wine-month Wine-month, the German name for October. shone in its golden prime, And the red grapes clustering hung, But a deeper sound, through the Switzer's clime, Than the vintage-music, rung. A sound, through vaulted cave, A sound, through echoing glen, Like the hollow swell of a rushing wave; —'Twas the tread of steel-girt men. And a trumpet, pealing wild and far, 'Midst the ancient rocks was blown, Till the Alps replied to that voice of war With a thousand of their own. And through the forest-glooms Flash'd helmets to the day, And the winds were tossing knightly plumes, Like the larch-boughs in their play. In Hasli's Hasli, a wild district in the canton of Berne. wilds there was gleaming steel, As the host of the Austrian pass'd; And the Schreckhorn's Schreckhorn, the peak of terror, a mountain in the canton of Berne. rocks, with a savage peal, Made mirth of his clarion's blast. Up 'midst the Righi Righi, a mountain in the canton of Schwytz. snows The stormy march was heard, With the charger's tramp, whence fire-sparks rose, And the leader's gathering word. But a band, the noblest band of all, Through the rude Morgarten strait, With blazon'd streamers, and lances tall, Moved onwards in princely state. They came with heavy chains, For the race despised so long— But amidst his Alp-domains, The herdsman's arm is strong! The sun was reddening the clouds of morn When they enter'd the rock-defile, And shrill as a joyous hunter's horn Their bugles rung the while. But on the misty height, Where the mountain-people stood, There was stillness, as of night, When storms at distance brood. There was stillness, as of deep dead night, And a pause—but not of fear, While the Switzers gazed on the gathering might Of the hostile shield and spear. On wound those columns bright Between the lake and wood, But they look'd not to the misty height Where the mountain-people stood. The pass was fill'd with their serried power, All helm'd and mail-array'd, And their steps had sounds like a thunder-shower In the rustling forest-shade. There were prince and crested knight, Hemm'd in by cliff and flood, When a shout arose from the misty height Where the mountain-people stood. And the mighty rocks came bounding down, Their startled foes among, With a joyous whirl from the summit thrown— —Oh! the herdsman's arm is strong! They came like lauwine Lauwine, the Swiss name for the avalanche. hurl'd From Alp to Alp in play, When the echoes shout through the snowy world And the pines are borne away. The fir-woods crash'd on the mountain-side, And the Switzers rush'd from high, With a sudden charge, on the flower and pride Of the Austrian chivalry: Like hunters of the deer, They storm'd the narrow dell, And first in the shock, with Uri's spear, Was the arm of William Tell. William Tell's name is particularly mentioned amongst the confederates at Morgarten. There was tumult in the crowded strait, And a cry of wild dismay, And many a warrior met his fate From a peasant's hand that day! And the empire's banner then From its place of waving free, Went down before the shepherd-men, The men of the Forest-sea Forest-sea, the lake of the four cantons is also so called.. With their pikes and massy clubs they brake The cuirass and the shield, And the war-horse dash'd to the reddening lake From the reapers of the field! The field—but not of sheaves— Proud crests and pennons lay, Strewn o'er it thick as the birch-wood leaves, In the autumn tempest's way. Oh! the sun in heaven fierce havoc view'd, When the Austrian turn'd to fly, And the brave, in the trampling multitude, Had a fearful death to die! And the leader of the war At eve unhelm'd was seen, With a hurrying step on the wilds afar, And a pale and troubled mien. But the sons of the land which the freeman tills, Went back from the battle-toil, To their cabin homes 'midst the deep green hills, All burden'd with royal spoil. There were songs and festal fires On the soaring Alps that night, When children sprung to greet their sires From the wild Morgarten fight. SEBASTIAN OF PORTUGAL. A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT. Dram. Pers. Sebastian. Zamor, a young Arab. Gonzalez his friend. Sylveira. Speakers' names have been abbreviated in this text. The abbreviations used for the characters are as follows: For Seb. read Sebastian For Gon. read Gonzalez For Zam. read Zamor For Sylv. read Sylveira Scene I. The sea-shore near Lisbon. Sebastian—Gonzalez—Zamor. Seb. With what young life and fragrance in its breath My native air salutes me! from the groves Of citron, and the mountains of the vine, And thy majestic tide thus foaming on In power and freedom o'er its golden sands, Fair stream, my Tajo! youth, with all its glow And pride of feeling, through my soul and frame Again seems rushing, as these noble waves Past their bright shores flow joyously. Sweet land, My own, my Fathers' land, of sunny skies And orange bowers!—Oh! is it not a dream That thus I tread thy soil? Or do I wake From a dark dream but now! Gonzalez, say, Doth it not bring the flush of early life Back on th' awakening spirit, thus to gaze On the far-sweeping river, and the shades Which in their undulating motion speak Of gentle winds amidst bright waters born, After the fiery skies and dark-red sands Of the lone desert? Time and toil must needs Have changed our mien; but this, our blessed land, Hath gained but richer beauty since we bade Her glowing shores farewell. Seems it not thus? Thy brow is clouded.— Gon. To mine eye the scene Wears, amidst all its quiet loveliness, A hue of desolation, and the calm, The solitude and silence which pervade Earth, air, and ocean, seem belonging less To peace than sadness! We have proudly stood Even on this shore, beside the Atlantic wave, When it hath look'd not thus. Seb. Ay, now thy soul Is in the past! Oh no, it look'd not thus When the morn smiled upon our thousand sails, And the winds blew for Afric! How that hour, With all its hues of glory, seems to burst Again upon my vision! I behold The stately barks, the arming, the array, The crests, the banners of my chivalry Swayed by the sea-breeze till their motion show'd Like joyous life! How the proud billows foam'd! And the oars flashed, like lightnings of the deep, And the tall spears went glancing to the sun, And scattering round quick rays, as if to guide The valiant unto fame! Ay, the blue heaven Seemed for that noble scene a canopy Scarce too majestic, while it rung afar To peals of warlike sound! My gallant bands! Where are you now? Gon. Bid the wide desert tell Where sleep its dead! To mightier hosts than them Hath it lent graves ere now; and on its breast Is room for nations yet! Seb. It cannot be That all have perished! Many a noble man, Made captive on that war-field, may have burst His bonds like ours. Cloud not this fleeting hour, Which to my soul is as the fountain's draught To the parched lip of fever, with a thought So darkly sad! Gon. Oh never, never cast That deep remembrance from you! When once more Your place is 'midst earth's rulers, let it dwell Around you, as the shadow of your throne, Wherein the land may rest. My king, this hour (Solemn as that which to the voyager's eye, In far and dim perspective, doth unfold A new and boundless world) may haply be The last in which the courage and the power Of truth's high voice may reach you. Who may stand As man to man, as friend to friend, before The ancestral throne of monarchs? Or, perchance, Toils, such as tame the loftiest to endurance, Henceforth may wait us here! But howsoe'er This be, the lessons now from sufferings past Befit all time, all change. Oh! by the blood, The free, the generous blood of Portugal, Shed on the sands of Afric,—by the names Which, with their centuries of high renown, There died, extinct for ever,—let not those Who stood in hope and glory at our side Here, on this very sea-beach, whence they pass'd To fall, and leave no trophy,—let them not Be soon, be e'er forgotten! for their fate Bears a deep warning in its awfulness, Whence power might well learn wisdom! Seb. Think'st thou, then, That years of sufferance and captivity, Such as have bow'd down eagle hearts ere now, And made high energies their spoil, have pass'd So lightly o'er my spirit? It is not thus! The things thou would'st recall are not of those To be forgotten! But my heart hath still A sense, a bounding pulse for hope and joy, And it is joy which whispers in the breeze Sent from my own free mountains. Brave Gonzalez! Thou art one to make thy fearless heart a shield Unto thy friend, in the dark stormy hour When knightly crests are trampled, and proud helms Cleft, and strong breastplates shiver'd. Thou art one To infuse the soul of gallant fortitude Into the captive's bosom, and beguile The long slow march beneath the burning noon With lofty patience; but for those quick bursts, Those buoyant efforts of the soul to cast Her weight of care to earth, those brief delights Whose source is in a sunbeam, or a sound Which stirs the blood, or a young breeze, whose wing Wanders in chainless joy; for things like these Thou hast no sympathies!—And thou, my Zamor, Art wrapt in thought! I welcome thee to this, The kingdom of my fathers. Is it not A goodly heritage? Zam. The land is fair: But he, the archer of the wilderness, Beholdeth not the palms beneath whose shade His tents are scatter'd, and his camels rest; And therefore is he sad! Seb. Thou must not pine With that sick yearning of the impatient heart, Which makes the exile's life one fever'd dream Of skies, and hills, and voices far away, And faces wearing the familiar hues Lent by his native sunbeams. I have known Too much of this, and would not see another Thus daily die. If it be so with thee, My gentle Zamor, speak. Behold, our bark Yet, with her white sails catching sunset's glow, Lies within signal reach. If it be thus, Then fare thee well—farewell, thou brave, and true, And generous friend! How often is our path Cross'd by some being whose bright spirit sheds A passing gladness o'er it, but whose course Leads down another current, never more To blend with ours! Yet far within our souls, Amidst the rushing of the busy world, Dwells many a secret thought, which lingers yet Around that image. And e'en so, kind Zamor, Shalt thou be long remembered! Zam. By the fame Of my brave sire, whose deeds the warrior tribes Tell round the desert's watchfire, at the hour Of silence, and of coolness, and of stars, I will not leave thee! 'Twas in such an hour The dreams of rest were on me, and I lay Shrouded in slumber's mantle, as within The chambers of the dead. Who saved me then, When the pard, soundless as the midnight, stole Soft on the sleeper? Whose keen dart transfix'd The monarch of the solitudes? I woke, And saw thy javelin crimson'd with his blood, Thou, my deliverer! and my heart e'en then Call'd thee its brother. Seb. For that gift of life With one of tenfold price, even freedom's self, Thou hast repaid me well. Zam. Then bid me not Forsake thee! Though my father's tents may rise At times upon my spirit, yet my home Shall be amidst thy mountains, Prince, and thou Shalt be my chief, until I see thee robed With all thy power. When thou canst need no more Thine Arab's faithful heart and vigorous arm, From the green regions of the setting sun Then shall the wanderer turn his steps, and seek His orient wilds again. Seb. Be near me still, And ever, O my warrior! I shall stand Again amidst my hosts a mail-clad king, Begirt with spears and banners, and the pomp And the proud sounds of battle. Be thy place Then at my side. When doth a monarch cease To need true hearts, bold hands? Not in the field Of arms, nor on the throne of power, nor yet The couch of sleep. Be our friend, we will not part. Gon. Be all thy friends then faithful, for e'en yet They may be fiercely tried. Seb. I doubt them not. Even now my heart beats high to meet their welcome. Let us away! Gon. Yet hear once more, my liege: The humblest pilgrim, from his distant shrine Returning, finds not e'en his peasant home Unchanged amidst its vineyards. Some loved face, Which made the sun-light of his lowly board, Is touch'd by sickness; some familiar voice Greets him no more; and shall not fate and time Have done their work, since last we parted hence, Upon an empire? Ay, within those years, Hearts from their ancient worship have fall'n off And bow'd before new stars: high names have sunk From their supremacy of place, and others Gone forth, and made themselves the mighty sounds At which thrones tremble. Oh! be slow to trust E'en those to whom your smiles were wont to seem As light is unto flowers. Search well the depths Of bosoms in whose keeping you would shrine The secret of your state. Storms pass not by Leaving earth's face unchanged. Seb. Whence didst thou learn The cold distrust which casts so deep a shadow O'er a most noble nature? Gon. Life hath been My stern and only teacher. I have known Vicissitudes in all things, but the most In human hearts. Oh! yet awhile tame down That royal spirit, till the hour be come When it may burst its bondage! On thy brow The suns of burning climes have set their seal, And toil, and years, and perils, have not pass'd O'er the bright aspect, and the ardent eye, As doth a breeze of summer. Be that change The mask beneath whose shelter thou may'st read Men's thoughts, and veil thine own. Seb. Am I thus changed From all I was? And yet it needs must be, Since e'en my soul hath caught another hue From its long sufferings. Did I not array The gallant flower of Lusian chivalry, And lead the mighty of the land, to pour Destruction on the Moslem? I return, And as a fearless and a trusted friend, Bring, from the realms of my captivity, An Arab of the desert!—But the sun Hath sunk below th' Atlantic. Let us hence— Gonzalez, fear me not. [Exeunt. Scene II. A Street in Lisbon illuminated. Many Citizens. 1st Cit. In sooth our city wears a goodly mien With her far-blazing fanes, and festive lamps Shining from all her marble palaces, Countless as heaven's fair stars. The humblest lattice Sends forth its radiance. How the sparkling waves Fling back the light! 2d Cit. Ay, 'tis a gallant show; And one which serves, like others, to conceal Things which must not be told. 3d Cit. What wouldst thou say? 2d Cit. That which may scarce, in perilous times like these, Be said with safety. Hast thou look'd within Those stately palaces? Were they but peopled With the high race of warlike nobles, once Their princely lords, think'st thou, good friend, that now They would be glittering with this hollow pomp, To greet a conqueror's entrance? 3d Cit. Thou say'st well. None but a land forsaken of its chiefs Had been so lost and won. 4th Cit. The lot is cast; We have but to yield. Hush! for some strangers come: Now friends, beware. 1st Cit. Did the king pass this way At morning, with his train? 2d Cit. Ay: saw you not The long and rich procession? [Sebast. enters with Gonzal. and Zamor. Seb. to Gon. This should be The night of some high festival. E'en thus My royal city to the skies sent up From her illumined fanes and towers a voice Of gladness, welcoming our first return From Afric's coast. Speak thou, Gonzalez, ask The cause of this rejoicing. To my heart Deep feelings rush, so migled and so fast, My voice perchance might tremble. Gon. Citizen, What festal night is this, that all your streets Are throng'd and glittering thus? 1st Cit. Hast thou not heard Of the king's entry, in triumphal pomp, This very morn? Gon. The king! triumphal pomp! Thy words are dark. Seb. Speak yet again: mine ears Ring with strange sounds. Again! 1st Cit. I said, the king, Philip of Spain, and now of Portugal, This morning enter'd with a conqueror's train Our city's royal palace: and for this We hold our festival. Seb. (in a low voice.) Thou said'st—the king! His name?—I heard it not. 1st Cit. Philip of Spain. Seb. Philip of Spain! We slumber, till aroused By th' earthquake's bursting shock. Hath there not fall'n A sudden darkness? All things seem to float Obscurely round me. Now 'tis past. The streets Are blazing with strange fire. Go, quench those lamps; They glare upon me till my very brain Grows dizzy, and doth whirl. How dare ye thus Light up your shrines for him? Gon. Away, away! This is no time, no scene— Seb. Philip of Spain! How name ye this fair land? Why—is it not The free, the chivalrous Portugal? the land By the proud ransom of heroic blood Won from the Moor of old? Did that red stream Sink to the earth, and leave no fiery current In the veins of noble men, that so its tide, Full swelling at the sound of hostile steps, Might be a kingdom's barrier? 2d Cit. That high blood Which should have been our strength, profusely shed By the rash King Sebastian, bathed the plains Of fatal Alcazar. Our monarch's guilt Hath brought this ruin down. Seb. Must this be heard, And borne, and unchastised. Man, darest thou stand Before me face to face, and thus arraign Thy sovereign? Zam. (aside to Seb.) Shall I lift the sword, my Prince, Against thy foes? Gon. Be still—or all is lost. 2d Cit. I dare speak that which all men think and know. 'Tis to Sebastian, and his waste of life, And power, and treasure, that we owe these bonds. 3d Cit. Talk not of bonds. May our new monarch rule The weary land in peace! But who art thou? Whence com'st thou, haughty stranger, that these things, Known to all nations, should be new to thee? Seb. (wildly.) I come from regions where the cities lie In ruins, not in chains. [Exit with Gonzal. and Zamor. 2d Cit. He wears the mien Of one that hath commanded; yet his looks And words were strangely wild. 1st Cit. Mark'd you his fierce And haughty gesture, and the flash that broke From his dark eye, when King Sebastian's name Became our theme? 2d Cit. Trust me, there's more in this Than may be lightly said. These are no times To breathe men's thoughts i'th' open face of heaven And ear of multitudes. They that would speak Of monarchs and their deeds, should keep within Their quiet homes. Come, let us hence, and then We'll commune of this stranger. [Scene III] The Portico of a Palace. Sebastian.—Gonzalez.—Zamor. Seb. Withstand me not! I tell thee that my soul, With all its passionate energies, is roused Unto that fearful strength which must have way E'en like the elements, in their hour of might And mastery o'er creation. Gon. But they wait That hour in silence. O! be calm awhile, Thine is not come. My king— Seb. I am no king, While in the very palace of my sires, Ay, where mine eyes first drank the glorious light, Where my soul's thrilling echoes first awoke To the high sound of earth's immortal names, Th' usurper lives and reigns. I am no king Until I cast him thence. Zam. Shall not thy voice Be as a trumpet to the awak'ning land? Will not the bright swords flash like sun-bursts forth, When the brave hear their chief? Gon. Peace, Zamor, peace! Child of the desert, what hast thou to do With the calm hour of counsel? —Monarch, pause, A kingdom's destiny should not be th' sport Of passion's reckless winds. There is a time When men, in very weariness of heart And careless desolation, tamed to yield By misery, strong as death, will lay their souls E'en at the conqueror's feet, as nature sinks, After long torture, into cold, and dull, And heavy sleep. But comes there not an hour Of fierce atonement? Ay, the slumberer wakes With gather'd strength and vengeance; and the sense And the remembrance of his agonies Are in themselves a power, whose fearful path Is like the path of ocean, when the heavens Take off its interdict. Wait then the hour Of that high impulse. Seb. Is it not the sun Whose radiant bursting through the embattled clouds Doth make it morn? The hour of which thou speak'st, Itself, with all its glory, is the work Of some commanding nature, which doth bid The sullen shades disperse. Away!—e'en now The land's high hearts, the fearless and the true, Shall know they have a leader. Is not this The mansion of mine own, mine earliest, friend Sylveira? Gon. Ay, its glittering lamps too well Illume the stately vestibule to leave Our sight a moment's doubt. He ever loved Such pageantries. Seb. His dwelling thus adorn'd On such a night! Yet will I seek him here. He must be faithful, and to him the first My tale shall be reveal'd. A sudden chill Falls on my heart; and yet I will not wrong My friend with dull suspicion. He hath been Link'd all too closely with mine inmost soul. And what have I to lose? Gon. Is their blood nought Who without hope will follow where thou lead'st, E'en unto death? Seb. Was that a brave man's voice? Warrior, and friend! how long then hast thou learn'd To hold thy blood thus dear? Gon. Of mine, mine own Think'st thou I spoke? When all is shed for thee Thou'lt know me better. Seb. (entering the palace.) For a while farewell. [Exit. Gon. Thus princes lead men's hearts. Come, follow me, And if a home is left me still, brave Zamor, There will I bid thee welcome. [Exeunt. Scene IV. A Hall within the Palace. Sebastian.—Sylveira. Sylv. Whence art thou, stranger?—what wouldst thou with me? There is a fiery wildness in thy mien, Startling and almost fearful. Seb. From the stern, And vast, and desolate wilderness, whose lord Is the fieree lion, and whose gentlest wind Breathes of the tomb, and whose dark children make The bow and spear their law, men bear not back That smilingness of aspect, wont to mask The secrets of their spirits 'midst the stir Of courts and cities. I have look'd on scenes Boundless, and strange, and terrible; I have known Sufferings which are not in the shadowy scope Of wild imagination; and these things Have stamp'd me with their impress. Man of peace, Thou look'st on one familiar with the extremes Of grandeur and of misery. Sylv. Stranger, speak Thy name and purpose briefly, for the time Ill suits these mysteries. I must hence; to-night I feast the lords of Spain. Seb. Is that a task For King Sebastian's friend? Sylv. Sebastian's friend! That name hath lost its meaning. Will the dead Rise from their silent dwellings, to upbraid The living for their mirth. The grave sets bounds Unto all human friendship. Seb. On the plain Of Alcazar full many a stately flower, The pride and crown of some high house, was laid Low in the dust of Afric; but of these Sebastian was not one. Sylv. I am not skill'd To deal with men of mystery. Take, then, off The strange dark scrutiny of thine eye from mine. What mean'st thou?—Speak! Seb. Sebastian died not there. I read no joy in that cold doubting mien. Is not thy name Sylveira? Sylv. Ay. Seb. Why, then, Be glad! I tell thee that Sebastian lives! Think thou on this—he lives! Should he return —For he may yet return—and find the friend In whom he trusted with such perfect trust As should be heaven's alone—mark'st thou my words? —Should he then find this man, not girt and arm'd, And watching o'er the heritage of his lord, But, reckless of high fame and loyal faith, Holding luxurious revels with his foes, How wouldst thou meet his glance? Sylv. As I do thine, Keen though it be, and proud. Seb. Why, thou dost quail Before it, even as if the burning eye Of the broad sun pursued thy shrinking soul Through all its depths. Sylv. Away! he died not there! He should have died there, with the chivalry And strength and honour of his kingdom, lost By his impetuous rashness. Seb. This from thee? Who hath given power to falsehood, that one gaze At its unmask'd and withering mien, should blight High souls at once? I wake. And this from thee There are, whose eyes discern the secret springs Which lie beneath the desert, and the gold And gems within earth's caverns, far below The everlasting hills: but who hath dared To dream that heaven's most awful attribute Invested his mortality, and to boast That through its inmost folds his glance could read One heart, one human heart? Why, then, to love And trust is but to lend a traitor arms Of keenest temper and unerring aim, Wherewith to pierce our souls. But thou, beware! Sebastian lives! Sylv. If it be so, and thou Art of his followers still, then bid him seek Far in the wilds, which gave one sepulchre To his proud hosts, a kingdom and a home, For none is left him here. Seb. This is to live An age of wisdom in an hour! The man Whose empire, as in scorn, o'erpass'd the bounds E'en of the infinite deep; whose orient realms Lay bright beneath the morning, while the clouds Were brooding in their sunset mantle still, O'er his majestic regions of the west; This heir of far dominion shall return, And, in the very city of his birth, Shall find no home! Ay, I will tell him this, And he will answer that the tale is false, False as a traitor's hollow words of love; And that the stately dwelling, in whose halls We commune now—a friend's, a monarch's gift, Unto the chosen of his heart, Sylveira, Should yield him still a welcome. Sylv. Fare thee well! I may not pause to hear thee, for thy words Are full of danger, and of snares, perchance Laid by some treach'rous foe. But all in vain. I mock thy wiles to scorn. Seb. Ha! ha! The snake Doth pride himself in his distorted cunning, Deeming it wisdom. Nay, thou go'st not thus. My heart is bursting, and I will be heard. What! know'st thou not my spirit was born to hold Dominion over thine? Thou shalt not cast Those bonds thus lightly from thee. Stand thou there, And tremble in the presence of thy lord! Sylv. This is all madness. Seb. Madness! no—I say 'Tis Reason starting from her sleep, to feel, And see, and know, in all their cold distinctness, Things which come o'er her, as a sense of pain O' th' sudden wakes the dreamer. Stay thee yet: Be still. Thou 'rt used to smile and to obey; Ay, and to weep. I have seen thy tears flow fast, As from the fullness of a heart o'ercharged With loyal love. Oh! never, never more Let tears or smiles be trusted! When thy king Went forth on his disastrous enterprise, Upon thy bed of sickness thou wast laid, And he stood o'er thee with the look of one Who leaves a dying brother, and his eyes Were fill'd with tears like thine. No! not like thine: His bosom knew no falsehood, and he deem'd Thine clear and stainless as a warrior's shield, Wherein high deeds and noble forms alone Are brightly imaged forth. Sylv. What now avail These recollections? Seb. What? I have seen thee shrink, As a murd'rer from the eye of light, before me: I have earn'd (how dearly and how bitterly It matters not, but I have earn'd at last) Deep knowledge, fearful wisdom. Now, begone! Hence to thy guests, and fear not, though arraign'd E'en of Sebastian's friendship. Make his scorn (For he will scorn thee, as a crouching slave By all high hearts is scorn'd) thy right, thy charter Unto vile safety. Let the secret voice, Whose low upbraidings will not sleep within thee, Be as a sign, a token of thy claim To all such guerdons as are shower'd on traitors, When noble men are crush'd. And fear thou not:— 'Tis but the kingly cedar which the storm Hurls from his mountain throne:—th' ignoble shrub, Groveling beneath, may live. Sylv. It is thy part To tremble for thy life. Seb. They that have look'd Upon a heart like thine, should know too well The worth of life to tremble. Such things make Brave men, and reckless. Ay, and they whom fate Would trample should be thus. It is enough— Thou may'st depart. Sylv. And thou, if thou dost prize Thy safety, speed thee hence. [Exit Sylveira. Seb. (alone.) And this is he Who was as mine own soul: whose image rose, Shadowing my dreams of glory with the thought That on the sick man's weary couch he lay, Pining to share my battles! CHORUS. Ye winds that sweep The conquer'd billows of the western deep, Or wander where the morn 'Midst the resplendent Indian heavens is born, Waft o'er bright isles, and glorious worlds the fame Of the crown'd Spaniard's name: Till in each glowing zone Its might the nations own, And bow to him the vassal knee Whose sceptre shadows realms from sea to sea. Seb. Away—away! this is no place for him Whose name hath thus resounded, but is now A word of desolation. [Exit. THE SIEGE OF VALENCIA. A DRAMATIC POEM.

Room in a Palace of Valencia.—Ximena singing to a Lute. BALLAD. “Thou hast not been with a festal throng At the pouring of the wine; Men bear not from the hall of song A mien so dark as thine! There's blood upon thy shield, There's dust upon thy plume, Thou hast brought from some disastrous field That brow of wrath and gloom!” “And is there blood upon my shield? Maiden, it well may be! We have sent the streams, from our battle-field, All darken'd to the sea! We have given the founts a stain, 'Midst their woods of ancient pine; And the ground is wet—but not with rain, Deep dyed—but not with wine! “The ground is wet—but not with rain— We have been in war array, And the noblest blood of Christian Spain Hath bathed her soil to-day. I have seen the strong man die, And the stripling meet his fate, Where the mountain-winds go sounding by, In the Roncesvalles' Strait. “In the gloomy Roncesvalles' Strait There are helms and lances cleft; And they that moved at morn elate On a bed of heath are left! There's many a fair young face Which the war-steed hath gone o'er; At many a board there is kept a place For those that come no more!” “Alas! for love, for woman's breast, If woe like this must be! Hast thou seen a youth with an eagle crest, And a white plume waving free? With his proud quick-flashing eye, And his mien of knightly state? Doth he come from where the swords flash'd high, In the Roncesvalles' Strait?” “In the gloomy Roncesvalles' Strait I saw, and mark'd him well; For nobly on his steed he sate, When the pride of manhood fell! But it is not youth which turns From the field of spears again; For the boy's high heart too wildly burns, Till it rests amidst the slain!” “Thou canst not say that he lies low, The lovely and the brave? Oh! none could look on his joyous brow, And think upon the grave! Dark, dark perchance the day, Hath been with valour's fate; But he is on his homeward way, From the Roncesvalles' Strait!” “There is dust upon his joyous brow, And o'er his graceful head; And the war-horse will not wake him now, Though it browse his greensward bed! I have seen the stripling die, And the strong man meet his fate, Where the mountain-winds go sounding by, In the Roncesvalles' Strait!” [Elmina enters. Elm. Your songs are not as those of other days, Mine own Ximena! Where is now the young And buoyant spirit of the morn, which once Breathed in your spring-like melodies, and woke Joy's echo from all hearts? Xim. My mother, this Is not the free air of our mountain-wilds; And these are not the halls wherein my voice First pour'd those gladd'ning strains. Elm. Alas! thy heart (I see it well) doth sicken for the pure Free-wand'ring breezes of the joyous hills, Where thy young brothers, o'er the rock and heath, Bound in glad boyhood, e'en as torrent streams Leap brightly from the heights. Had we not been Within these walls, thus suddenly begirt, Thou shouldst have track'd ere now, with step as light, Their wild-wood paths. Xim. I would not but have shared These hours of woe and peril, though the deep And solemn feelings wak'ning at their voice, Claim all the wrought-up spirit to themselves, And will not blend with mirth. The storm doth hush All floating whispery sounds, all bird-notes wild O' th' summer-forest, filling earth and heaven With its own awful music. And 'tis well! Should not a hero's child be train'd to hear The trumpet's blast unstartled, and to look In the fix'd face of death without dismay? Elm. Woe! woe! that aught so gentle and so young Should thus be call'd to stand i' the tempest's path, And bear the token and the hue of death On a bright soul so soon! I had not shrunk From mine own lot; but thou, my child, shouldst move, As a light breeze of heaven, through summer-bowers, And not o'er foaming billows. We are fall'n On dark and evil days! Xim. Ay, days, that wake All to their tasks!—Youth may not loiter now In the green walks of spring; and womanhood Is summon'd unto conflicts, heretofore The lot of warrior-souls. Strength is born In the deep silence of long-suffering hearts: Not amidst joy. Elm. Hast thou some secret woe That thus thou speak'st? Xim. What sorrow should be mine, Unknown to thee? Elm. Alas! the baleful air Wherewith the pestilence in darkness walks Through the devoted city, like a blight Amidst the rose-tints of thy cheek hath fall'n, And wrought an early withering!—Thou hast cross'd The paths of death, and minister'd to those O'er whom his shadow rested, till thine eye Hath changed its glancing sunbeam for a still, Deep, solemn radiance, and thy brow hath caught A wild and high expression, which at times Fades into desolate calmness, most unlike What youth's bright mien should wear. My gentle child! I look on thee in fear! Xim. Thou hast no cause To fear for me. When the wild clash of steel, And the deep tambour, and the heavy step Of armed men, break on our morning dreams! When, hour by hour, the noble and the brave Are falling round us, and we deem it much To give them funeral-rites, and call them blest If the good sword, in its own stormy hour, Hath done its work upon them, ere disease Had chill'd their fiery blood;—it is no time For the light mien wherewith, in happier hours, We trode the woodland mazes, when young leaves Were whisp'ring in the gale.—My father comes— Oh! speak of me no more. I would not shade His princely aspect with a thought less high Than his proud duties claim. [Gonzalez enters. Elm. My noble lord! Welcome from this day's toil!—It is the hour Whose shadows, as they deepen, bring repose Unto all weary men; and wilt not thou Free thy mail'd bosom from the corslet's weight, To rest at fall of eve? Gon. There may be rest For the tired peasant, when the vesper-bell Doth send him to his cabin, and beneath His vine and olive he may sit at eve, Watching his children's sport: but unto him Who keeps the watch-place on the mountain-height, When Heaven lets loose the storms that chasten realms —Who speaks of rest? Xim. My father, shall I fill The wine-cup for thy lips, or bring the lute Whose sounds thou lovest? Gon. If there be strains of power To rouse a spirit, which in triumphant scorn May cast off nature's feebleness, and hold Its proud career unshackled, dashing down Tears and fond thoughts to earth; give voice to those! I have need of such, Ximena!—we must hear No melting music now! Xim. I know all high Heroic ditties of the elder-time, Sung by the mountain-Christians, in the holds Of th' everlasting hills, whose snows yet bear The print of Freedom's step; and all wild strains Wherein the dark serranos Serranos, mountaineers. teach the rocks, And the pine-forests, deeply to resound The praise of later champions. Wouldst thou hear The war-song of thine ancestor, the Cid? Gon. Ay, speak of him; for in that name is power, Such as might rescue kingdoms! Speak of him! We are his children! They that can look back I' th' annals of their house on such a name, How should they take dishonour by the hand, And o'er the threshold of their father's halls First lead her as a guest? Elm. Oh, why is this? How my heart sinks! Gon. It must not fail thee yet, Daughter of heroes!—thine inheritance Is strength to meet all conflicts Thou canst number In thy long line of glorious ancestry Men, the bright offering of whose blood hath made The ground it bathed e'en as an altar, whence High thoughts shall rise for ever. Bore they not, 'Midst flame and sword, their witness of the Cross, With its victorious inspiration girt As with a conqueror's robe, till th' infidel, O'erawed, shrank back before them?—Ay, the earth Doth call them martyrs, but their agonies Were of a moment, tortures whose brief aim Was to destroy, within whose powers and scope Lay nought but dust.—And earth doth call them martyrs! Why, Heaven but claim'd their blood, their lives, and not The things which grow as tendrils round their hearts; No, not their children! Elm. Mean'st thou?—know'st thou aught?— I cannot utter it—My sons! my sons! Is it of them?—Oh! wouldst thou speak of them? Gon. A mother's heart divineth but too well! Elm. Speak, I adjure thee!—I can bear it all.— Where are my children? Gon. In the Moorish camp Whose lines have girt the city. Xim. But they live? —All is not lost, my mother! Elm. Say, they live. Gon. Elmina, still they live. Elm. But captives!—They Whom my fond heart had imaged to itself Bounding from cliff to cliff amidst the wilds Where the rock-eagle seem'd not more secure In its rejoicing freedom!—And my boys Are captives with the Moor!—Oh! how was this? Gon. Alas! our brave Alphonso, in the pride Of boyish daring, left our mountain-halls, With his young brother, eager to behold The face of noble war. Thence on their way Were the rash wanderers captured. Elm. 'Tis enough. —And when shall they be ransom'd? Gon. There is ask'd A ransom far too high. Elm. What! have we wealth Which might redeem a monarch, and our sons The while wear fetters?—Take thou all for them, And we will cast our worthless grandeur from us, As 'twere a cumbrous robe!—Why thou art one, To whose high nature pomp hath ever been But as the plumage to a warrior's helm, Worn or thrown off as lightly. And for me, Thou know'st not how serenely I could take The peasant's lot upon me, so my heart, Amidst its deep affections undisturb'd, May dwell in silence. Xim. Father! doubt thou not But we will bind ourselves to poverty, With glad devotedness, if this, but this, May win them back.—Distrust us not, my father! We can bear all things. Gon. Can ye bear disgrace? Xim. We were not born for this. Gon. No, thou say'st well! Hold to that lofty faith.—My wife, my child! Hath earth no treasures richer than the gems Torn from her secret caverns?—If by them Chains may be riven, then let the captive spring Rejoicing to the light!—But he, for whom Freedom and life may but be worn with shame, Hath nought to do, save fearlessly to fix His stedfast look on the majestic heavens, And proudly die! Elm. Gonzalez, who must die? Gon. (hurriedly.) They on whose lives a fearful price is set, But to be paid by treason!—Is't enough? Or must I yet seek words? Elm. That look saith more!— Thou canst not mean— Gon. I do!—why dwells there not Power in a glance to speak it?—They must die! They—must their names be told—Our sons must die Unless I yield the city! Xim. Oh! look up! My mother, sink not thus!—Until the grave Shut from our sight its victims, there is hope. Elm. (in a low voice.) Whose knell was in the breeze?—No, no, not theirs! Whose was the blessed voice that spoke of hope? —And there is hope!—I will not be subdued— I will not hear a whisper of despair! For nature is all-powerful, and her breath Moves like a quickening spirit o'er the depths Within a father's heart.—Thou too, Gonzalez, Wilt tell me there is hope! Gon. (solemnly.) Hope but in Him Who bade the patriarch lay his fair young son Bound on the shrine of sacrifice, and when The bright steel quiver'd in the father's hand Just raised to strike, sent forth his awful voice Through the still clouds, and on the breathless air Commanding to withhold!—Earth has no hope: It rests with Him. Elm. Thou canst not tell me this! Thou father of my sons, within whose hands Doth lie thy children's fate. Gon. If there have been Men in whose bosoms nature's voice hath made Its accents as the solitary sound Of an o'erpowering torrent, silencing Th' austere and yet divine remonstrances Whisper'd by faith and honour, lift thy hands; And, to that Heaven which arms the brave with strength, Pray, that the father of thy sons may ne'er Be thus found wanting! Elm. Then their doom is seal'd!— Thou wilt not save thy children? Gon. Hast thou cause, Wife of my youth! to deem it lies within The bounds of possible things, that I should link My name to that word—traitor?—They that sleep On their proud battle-fields, thy sires and mine, Died not for this! Elm. Oh, cold and hard of heart! Thou shouldst be born for empire, since thy soul Thus lightly from all human bonds can free Its haughty flight!—Men! men! too much is yours Of vantage; ye that with a sound, a breath, A shadow, thus can fill the desolate space Of rooted up affections, o'er whose void Our yearning hearts must wither!—So it is, Dominion must be won!—Nay, leave me not— My heart is bursting, and I must be heard! Heaven hath given power to mortal agony, As to the elements in their hour of might And mastery o'er creation!—Who shall dare To mock that fearful strength!—I must be heard! Give me my sons! Gon. That they may live to hide With covering hands th' indignant flush of shame On their young brows, when men shall speak of him They call'd their father!—Was the oath, whereby, On th' altar of my faith, I bound myself, With an unswerving spirit to maintain This free and Christian city for my God, And for my king, a writing traced on sand? That passionate tears should wash it from the earth, Or e'en the life-drops of a bleeding heart Efface it, as a billow sweeps away The last light vessel's wake?—Then never more Let man's deep vows be trusted!—though enforced By all th' appeals of high remembrances, And silent claims o' th' sepulchres, wherein His fathers with their stainless glory sleep, On their good swords! Think'st thou I feel no pangs? He that hath given me sons doth know the heart Whose treasure he recalls.—Of this no more. 'Tis vain. I tell thee that th' inviolate cross Still from our ancient temples, must look up Through the blue heavens of Spain, though at its foot I perish, with my race. Thou darest not ask That I, the son of warriors—men who died To fix it on that proud supremacy— Should tear the sign of our victorious faith, From its high place of sunbeams, for the Moor In impious joy to trample! Elm. Scorn me not In mine extreme of misery!—Thou art strong— Thy heart is not as mine.—My brain grows wild; I know not what I ask!—And yet 'twere but Anticipating fate—since it must fall, That cross must fall at last! There is no power, No hope within this city of the grave, To keep its place on high. Her sultry air Breathes heavily of death, her warriors sink Beneath their ancient banners, ere the Moor Hath bent his bow against them; for the shaft Of pestilence flies more swiftly to its mark, Than th' arrow of the desert. Even the skies O'erhang the desolate splendour of her domes With an ill omen's aspect, shaping forth, From the dull clouds, wild menacing forms and signs Foreboding ruin. Man might be withstood, But who shall cope with famine and disease When leagued with armed foes?—Where now the aid, Where the long-promised lances, of Castile? —We are forsaken in our utmost need— By Heaven and earth forsaken! Gon. If this be (And yet I will not deem it), we must fall As men that in severe devotedness Have chosen their part, and bound themselves to death, Through high conviction that their suffering land, By the free blood of martyrdom alone, Shall call deliverance down. Elm. Oh! I have stood Beside thee through the beating storms of life, With the true heart of unrepining love, As the poor peasant's mate doth cheerily, In the parch'd vineyard, or the harvest-field, Bearing her part, sustain with him the heat And burden of the day;—But now the hour, The heavy hour is come, when human strength Sinks down, a toil-worn pilgrim, in the dust, Owning that woe is mightier!—Spare me yet This bitter cup, my husband!—Let not her, The mother of the lovely, sit and mourn In her unpeopled home, a broken stem, O'er its fallen roses dying! Gon. Urge me not, Thou that through all sharp conflicts hast been found Worthy a brave man's love!—oh, urge me not To guilt, which through the midst of blinding tears, In its own hues thou seest not!—Death may scarce Bring aught like this! Elm. All, all thy gentle race, The beautiful beings that around thee grew, Creatures of sunshine! Wilt thou doom them all? —She too, thy daughter—doth her smile unmark'd Pass from thee, with its radiance, day by day? Shadows are gathering round her—seest thou not The misty dimness of the spoiler's breath Hangs o'er her beauty, and the face which made The summer of our hearts, now doth but send, With every glance, deep bodings through the soul, Telling of early fate. Gon. I see a change Far nobler on her brow!—She is as one, Who, at the trumpet's sudden call, hath risen From the gay banquet, and in scorn cast down The wine-cup, and the garland, and the lute Of festal hours, for the good spear and helm, Beseeming sterner tasks.—Her eye hath lost The beam which laugh'd upon th' awakening heart, E'en as morn breaks o'er earth. But far within Its full dark orb, a light hath sprung, whose source Lies deeper in the soul.—And let the torch Which but illumed the glittering pageant, fade! The altar-flame, i' th' sanctuary's recess, Burns quenchless, being of heaven!—She hath put on Courage, and faith, and generous constancy, Even as a breastplate.—Ay, men look on her, As she goes forth, serenely to her tasks, Binding the warrior's wounds, and bearing fresh Cool draughts to fever'd lips; they look on her, Thus moving in her beautiful array Of gentle fortitude, and bless the fair Majestic vision, and unmurmuring turn Unto their heavy toils. Elm. And seest thou not In that high faith and strong collectedness, A fearful inspiration?—They have cause To tremble, who behold th' unearthly light Of high, and, it may be, prophetic thought, Investing youth with grandeur!—From the grave It rises, on whose shadowy brink thy child Waits but a father's hand to snatch her back Into the laughing sunshine.—Kneel with me; Ximena, kneel beside me, and implore That which a deeper, more prevailing voice Than ours doth ask, and will not be denied; —His children's lives! Xim. Alas! this may not be, Mother!—I cannot. [Exit Ximena. Gon. My heroic child! —A terrible sacrifice thou claim'st, O God! From creatures in whose agonizing hearts Nature is strong as death! Elm. Is't thus in thine? Away!—what time is given thee to resolve On—what I cannot utter?—Speak! thou know'st Too well what I would say. Gon. Until—ask not! The time is brief. Elm. Thou said'st—I heard not right— Gon. The time is brief. Elm. What! must we burst all ties Wherewith the thrilling chords of life are twined; And, for this task's fulfilment, can it be That man in his cold heartlessness, hath dared, To number and to mete us forth the sands Of hours, nay, moments?—Why, the sentenced wretch, He on whose soul there rests a brother's blood Pour'd forth in slumber, is allow'd more time To wean his turbulent passions from the world His presence doth pollute!—It is not thus! We must have time to school us. Gon. We have but To bow the head in silence, when Heaven's voice Calls back the things we love. Elm. Love! love!—there are soft smiles and gentle words, And there are faces, skilful to put on The look we trust in—and 'tis mockery all! —A faithless mist, a desert-vapour, wearing The brightness of clear waters, thus to cheat The thirst that semblance kindled!—There is none, In all this cold and hollow world, no fount Of deep, strong, deathless love, save that within A mother's heart—It is but pride, wherewith To his fair son the father's eye doth turn, Watching his growth. Ay, on the boy he looks, The bright glad creature springing in his path, But as the heir of his great name, the young And stately tree, whose rising strength erelong Shall bear his trophies well.—And this is love! This is man's love!—What marvel?—you ne'er made Your breast the pillow of his infancy, While to the fulness of your heart's glad heavings His fair cheek rose and fell; and his bright hair Waved softly to your breath!—You ne'er kept watch Beside him, till the last pale star had set, And morn, all dazzling, as in triumph, broke On your dim weary eye; not yours the face Which, early faded through fond care for him, Hung o'er his sleep, and, duly as heaven's light, Was there to greet his wak'ning! You ne'er smooth'd His couch, ne'er sung him to his rosy rest, Caught his least whisper, when his voice from your, Had learn'd soft utterance; press'd your lip to his, When fever parch'd it; nush'd his wayward cries, With patient, vigilant, never-wearied love! No! these are woman's tasks!—In these her youth, And bloom of cheek, and buoyancy of heart, Steal from her all unmark'd!—My boys! my boys! Hath vain affection borne with all for this? —Why were ye given me? Gon. Is there strength in man Thus to endure? That thou couldst read, through all Its depths of silent agony, the heart Thy voice of woe doth rend! Elm. Thy heart—thy heart!—Away! it feels not now! But an hour comes to tame the mighty man Unto the infant's weakness; nor shall Heaven Spare you that bitter chastening!—May you live To be alone, when loneliness doth seem Most heavy to sustain!—For me, my voice Of prayer and fruitless weeping shall be soon With all forgotten sounds; my quiet place Low with my lovely ones, and we shall sleep, Though kings lead armies o'er us, we shall sleep, Wrapt in earth's covering mantle!—you the while Shall sit within your vast, forsaken halls, And hear the wild and melancholy winds Moan through their drooping banners, never more To wave above your race. Ay, then call up Shadows—dim phantoms from ancestral tombs, But all all—glorious—conquerors, chieftains, kings, To people that cold void!—And when the strength From your right arm hath melted, when the blast Of the shrill clarion gives your heart no more A fiery wakening; if at last you pine For the glad voices, and the bounding steps, Once through your home re-echoing, and the clasp Of twining arms, and all the joyous light Of eyes that laugh'd with youth, and made your board A place of sunshine;—when those days are come Then, in your utter desolation, turn To the cold world, the smiling, faithless world, Which hath swept past you long, and bid it quench Your soul's deep thirst with fame! immortal fame! Fame to the sick of heart!—a gorgeous robe A crown of victory, unto him that dies I' th' burning waste, for water! Gon. This from thee! Now the last drop of bitterness is pour'd. Elmina—I forgive thee! [Exit Elmina. Aid me, Heaven! From whom alone is power!—Oh! thou hast set Duties, so stern of aspect, in my path, They almost, to my startled gaze, assume The hue of things less hallow'd! Men have sunk Unblamed beneath such trials! Doth not He Who made us know the limits of our strength? My wife! my sons!—Away! I must not pause To give my heart one moment's mastery thus! [Exit Gonzalez. Scene II. —The Aisle of a Gothic Church. Hernandez, Garcias, and others. Her. The rites are closed. Now, valiant men depart, Each to his place—I may not say, of rest— Your faithful vigils for your sons may win What must not be your own. Ye are as those Who sow, in peril and in care, the seed Of the fair tree, beneath whose stately shade They may not sit. But bless'd be those who toil For after-days!—All high and holy thoughts Be with you, warriors, through the lingering hours Of the night-watch! Gar. Ay, father! we have need Of high and holy thoughts, wherewith to fence Our hearts against despair. Yet have I been From youth a son of war. The stars have look'd A thousand times upon my couch of heath, Spread 'midst the wild sierras, by some stream Whose dark-red waves look'd e'en as though their source Lay not in rocky caverns, but the veins Of noble hearts; while many a knightly crest Roll'd with them to the deep. And, in the years Of my long exile and captivity, With the fierce Arab I have watch'd beneath The still, pale shadow of some lonely palm, At midnight in the desert; while the wind Swell'd with the lion's roar, and heavily The fearfulness and might of solitude Press'd on my weary heart. Her. (thoughtfully.) Thou little know'st Of what is solitude!—I tell thee, those For whom—in earth's remotest nook, howe'er Divided from their path by chain on chain Of mighty mountains, and the amplitude Of rolling seas—there beats one human heart, There breathes one being, unto whom their name Comes with a thrilling and a gladd'ning sound Heard o'er the din of life, are not alone! Not on the deep, nor in the wild, alone; For there is that on earth with which they hold A brotherhood of soul!—Call him alone, Who stands shut out from this!—and let not those Whose homes are bright with sunshine and with love, Put on the insolence of happiness, Glorying in that proud lot!—A lonely hour Is on its way to each, to all; for Death Knows no companionship. Gar. I have look'd on Death In field, and storm, and flood. But never yet Hath aught weigh'd down my spirit to a mood Of sadness, dreaming o'er dark auguries, Like this, our watch by midnight. Fearful things Are gathering round us. Death upon the earth, Omens in heaven!—The summer skies put forth No clear bright stars above us, but at times, Catching some comet's fiery hue of wrath, Marshal their clouds to armies, traversing Heaven with the rush of meteor-steeds, th' array Of spears and banners, tossing like the pines Of Pyrenean forests, when the storm Doth sweep the mountains. Her. Ay, last night I too Kept vigil, gazing on the angry heavens; And I beheld the meeting and the shock Of those wild hosts i' th' air, when, as they closed, A red and sultry mist, like that which mantles The thunder's path, fell o'er them. Then were flung Through the dull glare, broad cloudy banners forth, And chariots seem'd to whirl, and steeds to sink, Bearing down crested warriors. But all this Was dim and shadowy;—then swift darkness rush'd Down on the unearthly battle, as the deep Swept o'er the Egyptian's armament.—I look'd— And all that fiery field of plumes and spears Was blotted from heaven's face!—I look'd again— And from the brooding mass of cloud leap'd forth One meteor-sword, which o'er the reddening sea Shook with strange motion, such as earthquakes give Unto a rocking citadel!—I beheld, And yet my spirit sunk not. Gar. Neither deem That mine hath blench'd. But these are sights and sounds To awe the firmest.—Know'st thou what we hear At midnight from the walls?—Were't but the deep Barbaric horn, or Moorish tambour's peal, Thence might the warrior's heart catch impulses Quickening its fiery currents. But our ears Are pierced by other tones. We hear the knell For brave men in their noon of strength cut down, And the shrill wail of woman, and the dirge Faint swelling through the streets. Then e en the air Hath strange and fitful murmurs of lament, As if the viewless watchers of the land Sigh'd on its hollow breezes!—To my soul, The torrent rush of battle, with its din Of trampling steeds and ringing panoply, Were, after these faint sounds of drooping woe, As the free sky's glad music unto him Who leaves a couch of sickness. Her. (with solemnity.) If to plunge In the mid-waves of combat, as they bear Chargers and spearmen onwards; and to make A reckless bosom's front the buoyant mark, On that wild current, for ten thousand arrows; If thus to dare were valour's noblest aim, Lightly might fame be won! But there are things Which ask a spirit of more exalted pitch, And courage temper'd with a holier fire! Well may'st thou say that these are fearful times, Therefore be firm, be patient!—There is strength, And a fierce instinct, e'en in common souls, To bear up manhood with a stormy joy, When red swords meet in lightning!—But our task Is more and nobler!—We have to endure, And to keep watch, and to arouse a land, And to defend an altar!—If we fall, So that our blood make but the millionth part Of Spain's great ransom, we may count it joy To die upon her bosom, and beneath The banner of her faith!—Think but on this, And gird your hearts with silent fortitude, Suffering, yet hoping all things—Fare ye well. Gar. Father, farewell. [Exeunt Garcias and his followers. Her. These men have earthly ties And bondage on their natures! To the cause Of God, and Spain's revenge, they bring but half Their energies and hopes. But he whom Heaven Hath call'd to be th' awakener of a land, Should have his soul's affections all absorb'd In that majestic purpose, and press on To its fulfilment, as a mountain-born And mighty stream, with all its vassal-rills, Sweeps proudly to the ocean, pausing not To dally with the flowers. Hark! What quick step Comes hurrying through the gloom at this dead hour? [Elmina enters. Elm. Are not all hours as one to misery? Why Should she take note of time, for whom the day And night have lost their blessed attributes Of sunshine and repose? Her. I know thy griefs; But there are trials for the noble heart; Wherein its own deep fountains must supply All it can hope of comfort. Pity's voice Comes with vain sweetness to th' unheeding ear Of anguish, e'en as music heard afar On the green shore, by him who perishes 'Midst rocks and eddying waters. Elm. Think thou not I sought thee but for pity. I am come For that which grief is priv'leged to demand With an imperious claim, from all whose form, Whose human form, doth seal them unto suffering! Father! I ask thine aid. Her. There is no aid For thee or for thy children, but with Him Whose presence is around us in the cloud, As in the shining and the glorious light. Elm. There is no aid!—art thou a man of God? Art thou a man of sorrow?—for the world Doth call thee such—and hast thou not been taught By God and sorrow?—mighty as they are, To own the claims of misery? Her. Is there power With me to save thy sons?—implore of Heaven! Elm. Doth not Heaven work its purposes by man? I tell thee thou canst save them! Art thou not Gonzalez' counsellor? Unto him thy words Are e'en as oracles— Her. And therefore?—Speak! The noble daughter of Pelayo's line Hath nought to ask, unworthy of the name Which is a nation's heritage. Dost thou shrink? Elm. Have pity on me, father! I must speak That, from the thought of which but yesterday I had recoil'd in scorn!—But this is past. Oh! we grow humble in our agonies, And to the dust—their birthplace—bow the heads That wore the crown of glory!—I am weak— My chastening is far more than I can bear. Her. These are no times for weakness. On our hills The ancient cedars, in their gather'd might, Are battling with the tempest; and the flower Which cannot meet its driving blast must die —But thou hast drawn thy nurture from a stem Unwont to bend or break.—Lift thy proud head, Daughter of Spain!—What would'st thou with thy lord? Elm. Look not upon me thus!—I have no power To tell thee. Take thy keen disdainful eye Off from my soul!—What! am I sunk to this? I, whose blood sprung from heroes!—How my sons Will scorn the mother that would bring disgrace On their majestic line!—My sons! my sons! —Now is all else forgotten!—I had once A babe that in the early spring-time lay Sickening upon my bosom, till at last, When earth's young flowers were opening to the sun, Death sunk on his meek eyelid, and I deem'd All sorrow light to mine!—But now the fate Of all my children seems to brood above me In the dark thunder-clouds!—Oh! I have power And voice unfaltering now to speak my prayer And my last lingering hope, that thou should'st win The father to relent, to save his sons! Her. By yielding up the city? Elm. Rather say By meeting that which gathers close upon us Perchance one day the sooner!—Is't not so? Must we not yield at last?—How long shall man Array his single breast against disease, And famine, and the sword? Her. How long?—While he Who shadows forth his power more gloriously In the high deeds and sufferings of the soul, Than in the circling heavens, with all their stars, Or the far-sounding deep, doth send abroad A spirit, which takes affliction for its mate, In the good cause, with solemn joy!—How long? —And who art thou, that, in the littleness Of thine own selfish purpose, would'st set bounds To the free current of all noble thought And generous action, bidding its bright waves Be stay'd, and flow no further?—But the Power Whose interdict is laid on seas and orbs, To chain them in from wandering, hath assign'd No limits unto that which man's high strength Shall, through its aid, achieve! Elm. Oh! there are times, When all that hopeless courage can achieve But sheds a mournful beauty o'er the fate Of those who die in vain. Her. Who dies in vain Upon his country's war-fields, and within The shadow of her altars?—Feeble heart! I tell thee that the voice of noble blood, Thus pour'd for faith and freedom, hath a tone Which, from the night of ages, from the gulf Of death, shall burst, and make its high appeal Sound unto earth and heaven! Ay, let the land, Whose sons, through centuries of woe hath striven, And perish'd by her temples, sink awhile, Borne down in conflict!—But immortal seed Deep, by heroic suffering, hath been sown On all her ancient hills; and generous hope Knows that the soil, in its good time, shall yet Bring forth a glorious harvest!—Earth receives Not one red drop from faithful hearts in vain. Elm. Then it must be!—And ye will make those lives, Those young bright lives, an offering—to retard Our doom one day! Her. The mantle of that day May wrap the fate of Spain! Elm. What led me here? Why did I turn to thee in my despair? Love hath no ties upon thee; what had I To hope from thee, thou lone and childless man! Go to thy silent home!—there no young voice Shall bid thee welcome, no light footstep spring Forth at the sound of thine!—What knows thy heart? Her. Woman! how darest thou taunt me with my woes? Thy children too shall perish, and I say It shall be well!—Why takest thou thought for them? Wearing thy heart, and wasting down thy life Unto its dregs, and making night thy time Of care yet more intense, and casting health, Unprized, to melt away, i' th' bitter cup Thou minglest for thyself?—Why, what hath earth To pay thee back for this? Shall they not live (If the sword spare them now) to prove how soon All love may be forgotten?—Years of thought, Long faithful watchings, looks of tenderness, That changed not, though to change be this world's law— Shall they not flush thy cheek with shame, whose blood Marks, e'en like branding iron?—to thy sick heart Make death a want, as sleep to weariness? Doth not all hope end thus?—or e'en at best, Will they not leave thee?—far from thee seek room For the o'erflowings of their fiery souls, On life's wide ocean?—Give the bounding steed, Or the wing'd bark to youth, that his free course May be o'er hills and seas; and weep thou not In thy forsaken home, for the bright world Lies all before him, and be sure he wastes No thought on thee! Elm. Not so! it is not so! Thou dost but torture me!—My sons are kind, And brave, and gentle. Her. Others too have worn The semblance of all good. Nay, stay thee yet; I will be calm, and thou shalt learn how earth, The fruitful in all agonies, hath woes Which far outweigh thine own. Elm. It may not be! Whose grief is like a mother's for her sons? Her. My son lay stretch'd upon his battle-bier, And there were hands wrung o'er him which had caught Their hue from his young blood! Elm. What tale is this? Her. Read you no records in this mien, of things Whose traces on man's aspect are not such As the breeze leaves on water?—Lofty birth, War, peril, power?—Affliction's hand is strong, If it erase the haughty characters They grave so deep!—I have not always been That which I am. The name I bore is not Of those which perish!—I was once a chief— A warrior—nor as now, a lonely man! I was a father! Elm. Then thy heart can feel! Thou wilt have pity! Her. Should I pity thee? Thy sons will perish gloriously—their blood— Elm. Their blood! my children's blood!—Thou speak'st as 'twere Of casting down a wine-cup, in the mirth And wantonness of feasting!—My fair boys! —Man! hast thou been a father? Her. Let them die! Let them die now, thy children! so thy heart Shall wear their beautiful image all undimm'd Within it, to the last! Nor shalt thou learn The bitter lesson, of what worthless dust Are framed the idols, whose false glory binds Earth's fetter on our souls!—Thou think'st it much To mourn the early dead; but there are tears Heavy with deeper anguish! We endow Those whom we love, in our fond passionate blindness, With power upon our souls, too absolute To be a mortal's trust! Within their hands We lay the flaming sword, whose stroke alone Can reach our hearts, and they are merciful, As they are strong, that wield it not to pierce us! —Ay, fear them, fear the loved!—Had I but wept O'er my son's grave, or o'er a babe's, where tears Are as spring dew-drops, glittering in the sun, And brightening the young verdure, I might still Have loved and trusted! Elm. (disdainfully.) But he fell in war! And hath not glory medicine in her cup For the brief pangs of nature? Her. Glory!—Peace, And listen!—By my side the stripling grew, Last of my line. I rear'd him to take joy I' th' blaze of arms, as eagles train their young To look upon the day-king!—His quick blood Even to his boyish cheek would mantle up, When the heavens rang with trumpets, and his eye Flash with the spirit of a race whose deeds— —But this availeth not!—Yet he was brave. I've seen him clear himself a path in fight As lightning through a forest, and his plume Waved like a torch, above the battle-storm, The soldier's guide, when princely crests had sunk, And banners were struck down.—Around my steps Floated his fame, like music, and I lived But in the lofty sound. But when my heart In one frail ark had ventured all, when most He seem'd to stand between my soul and heaven, —Then came the thunder-stroke! Elm. 'Tis ever thus! And the unquiet and foreboding sense That thus 'twill ever be, doth link itself Darkly with all deep love!—He died? Her. Not so! —Death! Death!—Why, earth should be a paradise, To make that name so fearful!—Had he died, With his young fame about him for a shroud, I had not learn'd the might of agony, To bring proud natures low!—No! he fell off— —Why do I tell thee this;—What right hast thou To learn how pass'd the glory from my house? Yet listen!—He forsook me!—He, that was As mine own soul, forsook me! trampled o'er The ashes of his sires!—ay, leagued himself E'en with the infidel, the curse of Spain; And, for the dark eye of a Moorish maid, Abjured his faith, his God!—Now, talk of death! Elm. Oh! I can pity thee— Her. There's more to hear. I braced the corslet o'er my heart's deep wound, And cast my troubled spirit on the tide Of war and high events, whose stormy waves Might bear it up from sinking;— Elm. And ye met No more? Her. Be still!—We did!—we met once more. God had his own high purpose to fulfil, Or think'st thou that the sun in his bright heaven Had look'd upon such things?—We met once more. That was an hour to leave its lightning-mark Sear'd upon brain and bosom! There had been Combat on Ebro's banks, and when the day Sank in red clouds, it faded from a field Still held by Moorish lances. Night closed round— A night of sultry darkness, in the shadow Of whose broad wing, e'en unto death, I strove Long with a turban'd champion; but my sword Was heavy with God's vengeance—and prevail'd. He fell—my heart exulted—and I stood In gloomy triumph o'er him. Nature gave No sign of horror, for 'twas Heaven's decree! He strove to speak—but I had done the work Of wrath too well;—yet in his last deep moan A dreadful something of familiar sound Came o'er my shuddering sense. The moon look'd forth, And I beheld—speak not!—twas he—my son! My boy lay dying there! He raised one glance, And knew me—for he sought with feeble hand To cover his glazed eyes. A darker veil Sank o'er them soon.—I will not have thy look Fix'd on me thus!—Away! Elm. Thou hast seen this, Thou hast done this—and yet thou liv'st? Her. I live! And know'st thou wherefore?—On my soul there fell A horror of great darkness, which shut out All earth, and heaven, and hope. I cast away The spear and helm, and made the cloister's shade The home of my despair. But a deep voice Came to me through the gloom, and sent its tones Far through my bosom's depths. And I awoke, Ay, as the mountain-cedar doth shake off Its weight of wintry snow, e'en so I shook Despondence from my soul, and knew myself Seal'd by that blood wherewith my hands were dyed, And set apart, and fearfully mark'd out Unto a mighty task!—To rouse the soul Of Spain as from the dead; and to lift up The cross, her sign of victory, on the hills, Gathering her sons to battle!—And my voice Must be as freedom's trumpet on the winds, From Roncesvalles to the blue sea-waves Where Calpe looks on Afric; till the land Have fill'd her cup of vengeance!—Ask me now To yield the Christian city, that its fanes May rear the minaret in the face of Heaven!— But death shall have a bloodier vintage-feast Ere that day come! Elm. I ask thee this no more, For I am hopeless now.—But yet one boon— Hear me, by all thy woes!—Thy voice hath power Through the wide city—here I cannot rest:— Aid me to pass the gates! Her. And wherefore? Elm. Thou, That wert a father, and art now—alone! Canst thou ask “wherefore?”—Ask the wretch whose sands Have not an hour to run, whose failing limbs Have but one earthly journey to perform, Why, on his pathway to the place of death, Ay, when the very axe is glistening cold Upon his dizzy sight, his pale, parch'd lip Implores a cup of water?—Why, the stroke Which trembles o'er him in itself shall bring Oblivion of all wants, yet who denies Nature's last prayer?—I tell thee that the thirst Which burns my spirit up is agony To be endured no more!—And I must look Upon my children's faces, I must hear Their voices, ere they perish!—But hath Heaven Decreed that they must perish?—Who shall say If in yon Moslem camp there beats no heart Which prayers and tears may melt? Her. There!—with the Moor! Let him fill up the measure of his guilt! —'Tis madness all!—How would'st thou pass th' array Of armed foes? Elm. Oh! free doth sorrow pass, Free and unquestion'd, through a suffering world! Her. This must not be. Enough of woe is laid E'en now upon thy lord's heroic soul, For man to bear, unsinking. Press thou not Too heavily th' o'erburthen'd heart.—Away! Bow down the knee, and send thy prayers for strength Up to Heaven's gate.—Farewell! [Exit Hernandez. Elm. Are all men thus? —Why, were't not better they should fall e'en now Than live to shut their hearts, in haughty scorn, Against the sufferer's pleadings?—But no, no! Who can be like this man, that slew his son, Yet wears his life still proudly, and a soul Untamed upon his brow? (After a pause. There's one, whose arms Have borne my children in their infancy, And on whose knees they sported, and whose hand Hath led them oft—a vassal of their sire's; And I will seek him: he may lend me aid, When all beside pass on. DIRGE, HEARD WITHOUT. Thou to thy rest art gone, High heart! and what are we, While o'er our heads the storm sweeps on, That we should mourn for thee? Free grave and peaceful bier To the buried son of Spain! To those that live, the lance and spear, And well if not the chain! Be theirs to weep the dead, As they sit beneath their vines, Whose flowery land hath borne no tread Of spoilers o'er its shrines! Thou hast thrown off the load Which we must yet sustain, And pour our blood where thine hath flow'd, Too blest if not in vain! We give thee holy rite, Slow knell, and chaunted strain. —For those that fall to-morrow night, May be left no funeral-train. Again, when trumpets wake, We must brace our armour on; But a deeper note thy sleep must break— —Thou to thy rest art gone! Happier in this than all, That, now thy race is run, Upon thy name no stain may fall, Thy work hath well been done! Elm. “Thy work hath well been done!”—so thou may'st rest! —There is a solemn lesson in those words— But now I may not pause. [Exit Elmina. Scene III. —A Street in the City. Hernandez—Gonzalez. Her. Would they not hear? Gon. They heard, as one that stands By the cold grave which hath but newly closed O'er his last friend doth hear some passer-by Bid him be comforted!—Their hearts have died Within them!—We must perish, not as those That fall when battle's voice doth shake the hills, And peal through heaven's great arch, but silently, And with a wasting of the spirit down, A quenching, day by day, of some bright spark, Which lit us on our toils!—Reproach me not; My soul is darken'd with a heavy cloud— —Yet fear not I shall yield! Her. Breathe not the word, Save in proud scorn!—Each bitter day o'erpass'd By slow endurance, is a triumph won For Spain's red cross. And be of trusting heart! A few brief hours, and those that turn'd away In cold despondence, shrinking from your voice, May crowd around their leader, and demand To be array'd for battle. We must watch For the swift impulse, and await its time, As the bark waits the ocean's. You have chosen To kindle up their souls, an hour, perchance, When they were weary; they had cast aside Their arms to slumber; or a knell, just then, With its deep hollow tone, had made the blood Creep shuddering through their veins; or they had caught A glimpse of some new meteor, and shaped forth Strange omens from its blaze. Gon. Alas! the cause Lies deeper in their misery!—I have seen, In my night's course through this beleaguer'd city, Things whose remembrance doth not pass away As vapours from the mountains.—There were some, That sat beside their dead, with eyes wherein Grief had ta'en place of sight, and shut out all But its own ghastly object. To my voice Some answer'd with a fierce and bitter laugh, As men whose agonies were made to pass The bounds of sufferance, by some reckless word, Dropt from the light of spirit.—Others lay— —Why should I tell thee, father! how despair Can bring the lofty brow of manhood down Unto the very dust?—And yet for this, Fear not that I embrace my doom—Oh God! That 'twere my doom alone!—with less of fix'd And solemn fortitude.—Lead on, prepare The holiest rites of faith, that I by them Once more may consecrate my sword, my life; —But what are these?—Who hath not dearer lives Twined with his own?—I shall be lonely soon— Childless!—Heaven wills it so. Let us begone. Perchance before the shrine my heart may beat With a less troubled motion. [Exeunt Gonzalez and Hernandez. Scene IV. —A Tent in the Moorish Camp. Abdullah—Alphonso—Carlos. Abd. These are bold words: but hast thou look'd on death, Fair stripling?—On thy cheek and sunny brow Scarce fifteen summers of their laughing course Have left light traces. If thy shaft hath pierced The ibex of the mountains, if thy step Hath climb'd some eagle's nest, and thou hast made His nest thy spoil, 'tis much!—And fear'st thou not The leader of the mighty? Alph. I have been Rear'd amongst fearless men, and 'midst the rocks And the wild hills, whereon my fathers fought And won their battles. There are glorious tales Told of their deeds, and I have learn'd them all. How should I fear thee, Moor? Abd. So, thou hast seen Fields, where the combat's roar hath died away Into the whispering breeze, and where wild flowers Bloom o'er forgotten graves!—But know'st thou aught Of those, where sword from crossing sword strikes fire, And leaders are borne down, and rushing steeds Trample the life from out the mighty hearts That ruled the storm so late?—Speak not of death Till thou hast look'd on such. Alph. I was not born A shepherd's son, to dwell with pipe and crook, And peasant men, amidst the lowly vales; Instead of ringing clarions, and bright spears, And crested knights!—I am of princely race; And, if my father would have heard my suit, I tell thee, infidel, that long ere now, I should have seen how lances meet, and swords Do the field's work. Abd. Boy!—know'st thou there are sights A thousand times more fearful?—Men may die Full proudly, when the skies and mountains ring To battle-horn and tecbir. Tecbir, the war-cry of the Moors and Arabs. But not all So pass away in glory. There are those, 'Midst the dead silence of pale multitudes, Led forth in fetters—dost thou mark me, boy? To take their last look of th' all gladdening sun, And bow, perchance, the stately head of youth Unto the death of shame!—Hadst thou seen this— Alph. (to Carlos.) Sweet brother, God is with us—fear thou not! We have had heroes for our sires:—this man Should not behold us tremble. Abd. There are means To tame the loftiest natures. Yet, again I ask thee, wilt thou, from beneath the walls Sue to thy sire for life?—or would'st thou die With this thy brother? Alph. Moslem!—on the hills, Around my father's castle, I have heard The mountain-peasants, as they dress'd the vines, Or drove the goats, by rock and torrent, home, Singing their ancient songs; and these were all Of the Cid Campeador; and how his sword Tizona, clear'd its way through turban'd hosts, And captured Afric's kings, and how he won Valencia from the Moor—I will not shame The blood we draw from him! [A Moorish soldier enters. Sol. Valencia's lord Sends messengers, my chief. Abd. Conduct them hither. [The soldier goes out and re-enters with Elmina, disguised, and an attendant. Car. (springing forward to the attendant.) Oh! take me hence, Diego! take me hence With thee, that I may see my mother's face At morning when I wake. Here dark-brow'd men Frown strangely, with their cruel eyes, upon us. Take me with thee, for thou art good and kind, And well I know thou lov'st me, my Diego! Abd. Peace, boy!—What tidings, Christian, from thy lord? Is he grown humbler?—doth he set the lives Of these fair nurslings at a city's worth? Alph. (rushing forward impatiently.) Say not he doth!—Yet wherefore art thou here? If it be so, I could weep burning tears For very shame! If this can be, return! Tell him, of all his wealth, his battle-spoils, I will but ask a war-horse and a sword, And that beside him in the mountain-chase, And in his halls, and at his stately feasts, My place shall be no more!—but, no!—I wrong, I wrong my father! Moor, believe it not, He is a champion of the cross and Spain, Sprung from the Cid!—and I, too, I can die As a warrior's high-born child! Elm. Alas, alas! And would'st thou die, thus early die, fair boy? What hath life done to thee, that thou should'st cast Its flower away, in very scorn of heart, Ere yet the blight be come? Alph. That voice doth sound— Abd. Stranger, who art thou?—this is mockery! speak! Elm. (throwing off a mantle and helmet, and embracing her sons.) My boys! whom I have rear'd through many hours Of silent joys and sorrows, and deep thoughts Untold and unimagined; let me die With you, now I have held you to my heart, And seen once more the faces, in whose light My soul hath lived for years! Car. Sweet mother! now Thou shalt not leave us more. Abd. Enough of this! Woman! what seek'st thou here? How hast thou dared To front the mighty thus amidst his hosts? Elm. Think'st thou there dwells no courage but in breasts That set their mail against the ringing spears, When helmets are struck down? Thou little know'st Of nature's marvels. Chief, my heart is nerved To make its way through things which warrior men, Ay, they that master death by field or flood, Would look on, ere they braved!—I have no thought, No sense of fear! Thou'rt mighty! but a soul Wound up like mine is mightier, in the power Of that one feeling pour'd through all its depths, Than monarchs with their hosts! Am I not come To die with these my children? Abd. Doth thy faith Bid thee do this, fond Christian? Hast thou not The means to save them? Elm. I have prayers, and tears, And agonies!—and he, my God; the God Whose hand, or soon or late, doth find its hour To bow the crested head—hath made these things Most powerful in a world where all must learn That one deep language, by the storm call'd forth From the bruis'd reeds of earth! For thee, perchance, Affliction's chastening lesson hath not yet Been laid upon thy heart, and thou may'st love To see the creatures, by its might brought low, Humbled before thee. [She throws herself at his feet. Conqueror, I can kneel! I, that drew birth from princes, bow myself E'en to thy feet! Call in thy chiefs, thy slaves If this will swell thy triumph, to behold The blood of kings, of heroes, thus abased! Do this, but spare my sons! Alph. (attempting to raise her.) Thou should'st not kneel Unto this infidel! Rise, rise, my mother! This sight doth shame our house! Abd. Thou daring boy! They that in arms have taught thy father's land How chains are worn, shall school that haughty mien Unto another language. Elm. Peace, my son! Have pity on my heart!—Oh, pardon, chief! He is of noble blood. Hear, hear me yet! Are there no lives through which the shafts of Heaven May reach your soul? He that loves aught on earth, Dares far too much, if he be merciless! Is it for those, whose frail mortality Must one day strive alone with God and death, To shut their souls against th' appealing voice Of nature, in her anguish?—warrior, man, To you, too, ay, and haply with your hosts, By thousands and ten thousands marshall'd round, And your strong armour on, shall come that stroke Which the lance wards not!—where shall your high heart Find refuge then, if in the day of might Woe hath lain prostrate, bleeding at your feet, And you have pitied not? Abd. These are vain words. Elm. Have you no children?—fear you not to bring The lightning on their heads?—In your own land Doth no fond mother, from the tents beneath Your native palms, look o'er the deserts out, To greet your homeward step?—You have not yet Forgot so utterly her patient love;— For is not woman's in all climes the same? That you should scorn my prayer!—O Heaven! his eye Doth wear no mercy! Abd. Then it mocks you not. I have swept o'er the mountains of your land, Leaving my traces, as the visitings Of storms upon them! Shall I now be stay'd? Know, unto me it were as light a thing In this my course, to quench your children's lives, As, journeying through a forest, to break off The young wild branches that obstruct the way With their green sprays and leaves. Elm. Are there such hearts Amongst thy works, O God? Abd. Kneel not to me. Kneel to your lord! on his resolves doth hang His children's doom. He may be lightly won By a few bursts of passionate tears and words. Elm. (rising indignantly.) Speak not of noble men!—He bears a soul Stronger than love or death. Alph. (with exultation.) I knew 'twas thus! He could not fail! Elm. There is no mercy, none, On this cold earth!—To strive with such a world, Hearts should be void of love!—We will go hence, My children! we are summon'd. Lay your heads, In their young radiant beauty, once again To rest upon this bosom. He that dwells Beyond the clouds which press us darkly round, Will yet have pity, and before his face We three will stand together! Moslem! now Let the stroke fall at once! Abd. 'Tis thine own will. These might e'en yet be spared. Elm. Thou wilt not spare! And he beneath whose eye their childhood grew, And in whose paths they sported, and whose ear From their first lisping accents caught the sound Of that word—Father—once a name of love— Is—Men shall call him steadfast. Abd. Hath the blast Of sudden trumpets ne'er at dead of night, When the land's watchers fear'd no hostile step, Startled the slumberers from their dreamy world, In cities, whose heroic lords have been Steadfast as thine? Elm. There's meaning in thine eye, More than thy words. Abd. (pointing to the city.) Look to yon towers and walls! Think you no hearts within their limits pine, Weary of hopeless warfare, and prepared To burst the feeble links which bind them still Unto endurance? Elm. Thou hast said too well. But what of this? Abd. Then there are those, to whom The prophet's armies not as foes would pass Yon gates, but as deliverers. Might they not In some still hour, when weariness takes rest, Be won to welcome us?—Your children's steps May yet bound lightly through their father's halls! Alph. (indignantly.) Thou treacherous Moor! Elm. Let me not thus be tried Beyond all strength, oh, Heaven! Abd. Now, 'tis for thee, Thou Christian mother! on thy sons to pass The sentence—life or death!—the price is set On their young blood, and rests within thy hands. Alph. Mother! thou tremblest! Abd. Hath thy heart resolved? Elm. (covering her face with her hands.) My boy's proud eye is on me, and the things Which rush in stormy darkness through my soul, Shrink from his glance. I cannot answer here. Abd. Come forth. We'll commune elsewhere. Car. (to his mother.) Wilt thou go? Oh! let me follow thee! Elm. Mine own fair child! Now that thine eyes have pour'd once more on mine The light of their young smile, and thy sweet voice Hath sent its gentle music through my soul, And I have felt the twining of thine arms— How shall I leave thee? Abd. Leave him, as 'twere but For a brief slumber, to behold his face At morning, with the sun's. Alph. Thou hast no look For me, my mother! Elm. Oh! that I should live To say, I dare not look on thee!—Farewell, My first-born, fare thee well! Alph. Yet, yet beware! It were a grief more heavy on thy soul, That I should blush for thee, than o'er my grave That thou should'st proudly weep! Abd. Away! we trifle here. The night wanes fast. Come forth! Elm. Once more embrace! My sons, farewell! [Exeunt Abdullah with Elmina and her Attendant. Alph. Hear me yet once, my mother!—Art thou gone? But one word more! [He rushes out, followed by Carlos. Scene V. —The Garden of a Palace in Valencia. Ximena, Theresa. Ther. Stay yet awhile. A purer air doth rove Here through the myrtles whispering, and the limes, And shaking sweetness from the orange boughs, Than waits you in the city. Xim. There are those In their last need, and on their bed of death, At which no hand doth minister but mine That wait me in the city. Let us hence. Ther. You have been wont to love the music made By founts, and rustling foliage, and soft winds, Breathing of citron-groves. And will you turn From these to scenes of death? Xim. To me the voice Of summer, whispering through young flowers and leaves, Now speaks too deep a language! and of all Its dreamy and mysterious melodies, The breathing soul is sadness!—I have felt That summons through my spirit, after which The hues of earth are changed, and all her sounds Seem fraught with secret warnings.—There is cause That I should bend my footsteps to the scenes Where Death is busy, taming warrior-hearts, And pouring winter through the fiery blood, And fett'ring the strong arm!—For now no sigh In the dull air, nor floating cloud in heaven, No, not the lightest murmur of a leaf, But of his angel's silent coming bears Some token to my soul.—But nought of this Unto my mother!—These are awful hours! And on their heavy steps afflictions crowd With such dark pressure, there is left no room For one grief more. Ther. Sweet lady, talk not thus! Your eye this morn doth wear a calmer light, There's more of life in its clear trem'lous ray Than I have mark'd of late. Nay, go not yet; Rest by this fountain, where the laurels dip Their glossy leaves. A fresher gale doth spring From the transparent waters, dashing round Their silvery spray, with a sweet voice of coolness, O'er the pale glistening marble. 'Twill call up Faint bloom, if but a moment's, to your cheek. Rest here, ere you go forth, and I will sing The melody you love. THERESA sings. Why is the Spanish maiden's grave So far from her own bright land? The sunny flowers that o'er it wave Were sown by no kindred hand. 'Tis not the orange-bough that sends Its breath on the sultry air, 'Tis not the myrtle-stem that bends To the breeze of evening there! But the rose of Sharon's eastern bloom By the silent dwelling fades, And none but strangers pass the tomb Which the palm of Judah shades. The lowly Cross, with flowers o'ergrown, Marks well that place of rest; But who hath graved, on its mossy stone, A sword, a helm, a crest? These are the trophies of a chief, A lord of the axe and spear! —Some blossom pluck'd, some faded leaf, Should grace a maiden's bier! Scorn not her tomb—deny not her The honours of the brave! O'er that forsaken sepulchre, Banner and plume might wave. She bound the steel, in battle tried, Her fearless heart above, And stood with brave men, side by side, In the strength and faith of love! That strength prevail'd—that faith was bless'd! True was the javelin thrown, Yet pierced it not her warrior's breast: She met it with her own! And nobly won, where heroes fell In arms for the holy shrine, A death which saved what she loved so well, And a grave in Palestine. Then let the rose of Sharon spread Its breast to the glowing air, And the palm of Judah lift its head, Green and immortal there! And let yon grey stone, undefaced, With its trophy mark the scene, Telling the pilgrim of the waste, Where Love and Death have been. Xim. Those notes were wont to make my heart beat quick, As at a voice of victory; but to-day The spirit of the song is changed, and seems All mournful. Oh! that, ere my early grave Shuts out the sunbeam, I might hear one peal Of the Castilian trumpet, ringing forth Beneath my father's banner!—In that sound Were life to you, sweet brothers!—But for me— Come on—our tasks await us. They who know Their hours are number'd out, have little time To give the vague and slumberous languor way, Which doth steal o'er them in the breath of flowers, And whisper of soft winds. [Elmina enters hurriedly. Elm. The air will calm my spirit, ere yet I meet His eye, which must be met.—Thou here, Ximena! [She starts back on seeing Ximena. Xim. Alas! my mother! In that hurrying step And troubled glance I read— Elm. (wildly.) Thou read'st it not! Why, who would live, if unto mortal eye The things lay glaring, which within our hearts We treasure up for God's?—Thou read'st it not! I say, thou canst not!—There's not one on earth Shall know the thoughts, which for themselves have made And kept dark places in the very breast Whereon he hath laid his slumber, till the hour When the graves open! Xim. Mother! what is this? Alas! your eye is wandering, and your cheek Flush'd, as with fever! To your woes the night Hath brought no rest. Elm. Rest!—who should rest?—not he That holds one earthly blessing to his heart Nearer than life!—No! if this world have aught Of bright or precious, let not him who calls Such things his own, take rest!—Dark spirits keep watch, And they to whom fair honour, chivalrous fame, Were as heaven's air, the vital element Wherein they breathed, may wake, and find their souls Made marks for human scorn!—Will they bear on With life struck down, and thus disrobed of all Its glorious drapery?—Who shall tell us this? —Will he so bear it? Xim. Mother! let us kneel And blend our hearts in prayer!—What else is left To mortals when the dark hour's might is on them? —Leave us, Theresa.—Grief like this doth find Its balm in solitude. [Exit Theresa. My mother! peace Is heaven's benignant answer to the cry Of wounded spirits. Wilt thou kneel with me? Elm. Away! 'tis but for souls unstain'd, to wear Heaven's tranquil image on their depths.—The stream Of my dark thoughts, all broken by the storm, Reflects but clouds and lightnings!—Didst thou speak Of peace?—'tis fled from earth!—but there is joy! Wild, troubled joy! And who shall know, my child! It is not happiness?—Why, our own hearts Will keep the secret close!—Joy, joy! if but To leave this desolate city, with its dull Slow knells and dirges, and to breathe again Th' untainted mountain-air!—But hush! the trees, The flowers, the waters, must hear nought of this! They are full of voices, and will whisper things— —We'll speak of it no more. Xim. Oh! pitying Heaven! This grief doth shake her reason! Elm. (starting.) Hark! a step! 'Tis—'tis thy father's!—come away—not now— He must not see us now! Xim. Why should this be? [Gonzalez enters, and detains Elmina. Gon. Elmina, dost thou shun me?—Have we not, E'en from the hopeful and the sunny time When youth was as a glory round our brows, Held on through life together?—And is this, When eve is gathering round us, with the gloom Of stormy clouds, a time to part our steps Upon the darkening wild? Elm. (coldly.) There needs not this. Why should'st thou think I shunn'd thee? Gon. Should the love That shone o'er many years, th' unfading love, Whose only change hath been from gladd'ning smiles To mingling sorrows and sustaining strength, Thus lightly be forgotten? Elm. Speak'st thou thus? —I have knelt before thee with that very plea, When it avail'd me not!—But there are things Whose very breathings from the soul erase All record of past love, save the chill sense, Th' unquiet memory of its wasted faith, And vain devotedness!—Ay! they that fix Affection's perfect trust on aught of earth, Have many a dream to start from! Gon. This is but The wildness and the bitterness of grief, Ere yet the unsettled heart hath closed its long Impatient conflicts with a mightier power, Which makes all conflict vain. —Hark! was there not A sound of distant trumpets, far beyond The Moorish tents, and of another tone Than th' Afric horn, Ximena? Xim. Oh, my father! I know that horn too well.—'Tis but the wind, Which, with a sudden rising, bears its deep And savage war-note from us, wafting it O'er the far hills. Gon. Alas! this woe must be! I do not shake my spirit from its height, So startling it with hope!—But the dread hour Shall be met bravely still. I can keep down Yet for a little while—and Heaven will ask No more—the passionate workings of my heart —And thine—Elmina? Elm. 'Tis—I am prepared. I have prepared for all. Gon. Oh, well I knew Thou would'st not fail me!—Not in vain my soul, Upon thy faith and courage, hath built up Unshaken trust. Elm. (wildly.) Away!—thou know'st me not! Man dares too far, his rashness would invest This our mortality with an attribute Too high and awful, boasting that he knows One human heart! Gon. These are wild words, but yet I will not doubt thee!—Hast thou not been found Noble in all things, pouring thy soul's light Undimm'd o'er every trial?—And, as our fates, So must our names be, undivided!—Thine, I' th' record of a warrior's life, shall find Its place of stainless honour.—By his side— Elm. May this be borne?—How much of agony Hath the heart room for?—Speak to me in wrath —I can endure it!—But no gentle words! No words of love! no praise!—Thy sword might slay, And be more merciful! Gon. Wherefore art thou thus? Elmina, my beloved! Elm. No more of love! —Have I not said there's that within my heart, Whereon it falls as living fire would fall Upon an unclosed wound? Gon. Nay, lift thine eyes, That I may read their meaning! Elm. Never more With a free soul—What have I said?—'twas nought! Take thou no heed! The words of wretchedness Admit not scrutiny. Would'st thou mark the speech Of troubled dreams? Gon. I have seen thee in the hour Of thy deep spirit's joy, and when the breath Of grief hung chilling round thee; in all change, Bright health and drooping sickness; hope and fear; Youth and decline; but never yet, Elmina, Ne'er hath thine eye till now shrunk back perturb'd With shame or dread, from mine! Elm. Thy glance doth search A wounded heart too deeply. Gon. Hast thou there Aught to conceal? Elm. Who hath not? Gon. Till this hour Thou never hadst!—Yet hear me!—by the free And unattainted fame which wraps the dust Of thine heroic fathers— Elm. This to me! —Bring your inspiring war-notes, and your sounds Of festal music round a dying man! Will his heart echo them?—But if thy words Were spells, to call up, with each lofty tone, The grave's most awful spirits, they would stand Powerless, before my anguish! Gon. Then, by her, Who there looks on thee in the purity Of her devoted youth, and o'er whose name No blight must fall, and whose pale cheek must ne'er Burn with that deeper tinge, caught painfully From the quick feeling of dishonour.—Speak! Unfold this mystery!—By thy sons— Elm. My sons! And canst thou name them? Gon. Proudly!—Better far They died with all the promise of their youth, And the fair honour of their house upon them, Than that, with manhood's high and passionate soul, To fearful strength unfolded, they should live, Barr'd from the lists of crested chivalry, And pining, in the silence of a woe, Which from the heart shuts daylight—o'er the shame Of those who gave them birth!—But thou could'st ne'er Forget their lofty claims! Elm. (wildly.) 'Twas but for them! 'Twas for them only!—Who shall dare arraign Madness of crime?—And He who made us, knows There are dark moments of all hearts and lives, Which bear down reason! Gon. Thou, whom I have loved With such high trust as o'er our nature threw A glory scarce allow'd;—what hast thou done? —Ximena, go thou hence! Elm. No, no! my child! There's pity in thy look!—All other eyes Are full of wrath and scorn!—Oh! leave me not! Gon. That I should live to see thee thus abased! —Yet speak?—What hast thou done? Elm. Look to the gate! Thou'rt worn with toil—but take no rest to-night! The western gate!—Its watchers have been won— The Christian city hath been bought and sold!— They will admit the Moor! Gon. They have been won! Brave men and tried so long!—Whose work was this? Elm. Think'st thou all hearts like thine?—Can mothers stand To see their children perish? Gon. Then the guilt Was thine? Elm. Shall mortal dare to call it guilt? I tell thee, Heaven, which made all holy things, Made nought more holy than the boundless love Which fills a mother's heart!—I say, 'tis woe Enough, with such an aching tenderness, To love aught earthly!—and in vain! in vain! —We are press'd down too sorely! Gon. (in a low desponding voice.) Now my life Is struck to worthless ashes!—In my soul Suspicion hath ta'en root. The nobleness Henceforth is blotted from all human brows; And fearful power, a dark and troublous gift, Almost like prophecy, is pour'd upon me, To read the guilty secrets in each eye That once look'd bright with truth! —Why, then, I have gain'd What men call wisdom!—A new sense, to which All tales that speak of high fidelity, And holy courage, and proud honour, tried, Search'd, and found steadfast, even to martyrdom, Are food for mockery!—Why should I not cast From my thinn'd locks the wearing helm at once, And in the heavy sickness of my soul Throw the sword down for ever?—Is there aught In all this world of gilded hollowness, Now the bright hues drop off its loveliest things, Worth striving for again? Xim. Father! look up! Turn unto me, thy child! Gon. Thy face is fair; And hath been unto me, in other days, As morning to the journeyer of the deep; But now—'tis too like hers! Elm. (falling at his feet.) Woe, shame and woe, Are on me in their might!—forgive, forgive! Gon. (starting up.) Doth the Moor deem that I have part, or share, Or counsel in this vileness?—Stay me not! Let go thy hold—'tis powerless on me now— I linger here, while treason is at work! [Exit Gonzalez. Elm. Ximena, dost thou scorn me? Xim. I have found In mine own heart too much of feebleness, Hid, beneath many foldings, from all eyes But His whom nought can blind, to dare do aught But pity thee, dear mother! Elm. Blessings light On thy fair head, my gentle child, for this! Thou kind and merciful!—My soul is faint— Worn with long strife!—Is there aught else to do, Or suffer, ere we die?—Oh God! my sons! —I have betray'd them!—All their innocent blood Is on my soul! Xim. How shall I comfort thee? —Oh! hark! what sounds come deepening on the wind, So full of solemn hope! (A procession of Nuns passes across the Scene, bearing relics, and chanting.) CHANT. A sword is on the land! He that bears down young tree and glorious flower, Death is gone forth, he walks the wind in power! Where is the warrior's hand? Our steps are in the shadows of the grave, Hear us, we perish! Father, hear and save! If, in the days of song, The days of gladness, we have call'd on thee, When mirthful voices rang from sea to sea, And joyous hearts were strong; Now that alike the feeble and the brave Must cry, “We perish!”—Father, hear and save! The days of song are fled! The winds come loaded, wafting dirge-notes by, But they that linger soon unmourn'd must die;— The dead weep not the dead!— Wilt thou forsake us 'midst the stormy wave? We sink, we perish!—Father, hear and save! Helmet and lance are dust! Is not the strong man wither'd from our eye? The arm struck down that held our banners high?— Thine is our spirits' trust! Look through the gath'ring shadows of the grave! Do we not perish?—Father, hear and save! [Hernandez enters. Elm. Why com'st thou, man of vengeance?—What have I To do with thee?—Am I not bow'd enough?— Thou art no mourner's comforter! Her. Thy lord Hath sent me unto thee. Till this day's task Be closed, thou daughter of the feeble heart! He bids thee seek him not, but lay thy ways Before Heaven's altar, and in penitence Make thy soul's peace with God. Elm. Till this day's task Be closed!—there is strange triumph in thine eyes— Is it that I have fall'n from that high place Whereon I stood in fame?—But I can feel A wild and bitter pride in thus being past The power of thy dark glance!—My spirit now Is wound about by one sole mighty grief; Thy scorn hath lost its sting. Thou may'st reproach— Her. I come not to reproach thee. Heaven doth work By many agencies; and in its hour There is no insect which the summer breeze From the green leaf shakes trembling, but may serve Its deep unsearchable purposes, as well As the great ocean, or th' eternal fires Pent in earth's caves!—Thou hast but speeded that, Which, in th' infatuate blindness of thy heart, Thou would'st have trampled o'er all holy ties But to avert one day! Elm. My senses fail— Thou said'st—speak yet again—I could not catch The meaning of thy words. Her. E'en now thy lord Hath sent our foes defiance. On the walls He stands in conference with the boastful Moor, And awful strength is with him. Through the blood Which this day must be pour'd in sacrifice Shall Spain be free. On all her olive-hills Shall men set up the battle-sign of fire, And round its blaze, at midnight, keep the sense Of vengeance wakeful in each other's hearts E'en with thy children's tale! Xim. Peace, father! peace! Behold she sinks!—the storm hath done its work Upon the broken reed. Oh! lend thine aid To bear her hence. [They lead her away. Scene VI. —A Street in Valencia. Several Groups of Citizens and Soldiers, many of them lying on the steps of a church. Arms scattered on the ground around them. An Old Cit. The air is sultry, as with thunder-clouds. I left my desolate home, that I might breathe More freely in heaven's face, but my heart feels With this hot gloom o'erburden'd. I have now No sons to tend me. Which of you, kind friends, Will bring the old man water from the fount, To moisten his parch'd lip? [A citizen goes out. 2d Cit. This wasting siege, Good Father Lopez, hath gone hard with you! 'Tis sad to hear no voices through the house, Once peopled with fair sons! 3d Cit. Why, better thus, Than to be haunted with their famish'd cries, E'en in your very dreams! Old Cit. Heaven's will be done! These are dark times! I have not been alone In my affliction. 3d Cit. (with bitterness.) Why, we have but this thought Left for our gloomy comfort!—And 'tis well! Ay, let the balance be awhile struck even Between the noble's palace and the hut, Where the worn peasant sickens!—They that bear The humble dead unhonour'd to their homes, Pass now i' th' streets no lordly bridal train With its exulting music; and the wretch Who on the marble steps of some proud hall Flings himself down to die, in his last need And agony of famine, doth behold No scornful guests, with their long purple robes, To the banquet sweeping by. Why, this is just! These are the days when pomp is made to feel Its human mould! 4th Cit. Heard you last night the sound Of Saint Iago's bell?—How sullenly From the great tower it peal'd! 5th Cit. Ay, and tis said No mortal hand was near when so it seem'd To shake the midnight streets. Old Cit. Too well I know The sound of coming fate!—'Tis ever thus When Death is on his way to make it night In the Cid's ancient house.—Oh! there are things In this strange world of which we've all to learn When its dark bounds are pass'd.—Yon bell, untouch'd (Save by the hands we see not), still doth speak— When of that line some stately head is mark'd,— With a wild hollow peal, at dead of night, Rocking Valencia's towers. I've heard it oft, Nor known its warning false. 4th Cit. And will our chief Buy with the price of his fair children's blood A few more days of pining wretchedness For this forsaken city? Old Cit. Doubt it not! —But with that ransom he may purchase still Deliverance for the land!—And yet 'tis sad To think that such a race, with all its fame, Should pass away!—For she, his daughter too, Moves upon earth as some bright thing whose time To sojourn there is short. 5th Cit. Then woe for us When she is gone!—Her voice—the very sound Of her soft step was comfort, as she moved Through the still house of mourning!—Who like her Shall give us hope again? Old Cit. Be still!—she comes, And with a mien how changed!—A hurrying step, And a flush'd cheek!—What may this bode?—Be still! Ximena enters, with Attendants carrying a Banner. Xim. Men of Valencia! in an hour like this, What do ye here? A Cit. We die! Xim. Brave men die now Girt for the toil, as travellers suddenly By the dark night o'ertaken on their way! These days require such death!—It is too much Of luxury for our wild and angry times, To fold the mantle round us, and to sink From life, as flowers that shut up silently, When the sun's heat doth scorch them! Hear ye not? A Cit. Lady! what would'st thou with us? Xim. Rise and arm! E'en now the children of your chief are led Forth by the Moor to perish!—Shall this be, Shall the high sound of such a name be hush'd, I' th' land to which for ages it hath been A battle-word, as 'twere some passing note Of shepherd-music?—Must this work be done, And ye lie pining here, as men in whom The pulse which God hath made for noble thought Can so be thrill'd no longer? Cit. 'Tis e'en so! Sickness, and toil, and grief, have breathed upon us, Our hearts beat faint and low. Xim. Are ye so poor Of soul, my countrymen! that ye can draw Strength from no deeper source than that which sends The red blood mantling through the joyous veins, And gives the fleet step wings?—Why, how have age And sens'tive womanhood ere now endured, Through pangs of searching fire, in some proud cause, Blessing that agony? Think ye the Power Which bore them nobly up, as if to teach The torturer where eternal Heaven had set Bounds to his sway, was earthy, of this earth— This dull mortality?—Nay, then look on me! Death's touch hath mark'd me, and I stand amongst you, As one whose place, i' th' sunshine of your world, Shall soon be left to fill!—I say, the breath Of th' incense, floating through yon fane, shall scarce Pass from your path before me! But even now, I've that within me, kindling through the dust, Which from all time hath made high deeds its voice And token to the nations;—Look on me! Why hath Heaven pour'd forth courage, as a flame Wasting the womanish heart, which must be still'd Yet sooner for its swift consuming brightness, If not to shame your doubt, and your despair, And your soul's torpor?—Yet, arise and arm! It may not be too late. A Cit. Why, what are we, To cope with hosts?—Thus faint, and worn, and few, O'ernumber'd and forsaken, is't for us To stand against the mighty? Xim. And for whom Hath He, who shakes the mighty with a breath From their high places, made the fearfulness, And ever-wakeful presence of his power, To the pale startled earth most manifest, But for the weak?—Was't for the helm'd and crown'd That suns were stay'd at noonday?—Stormy seas As a rill parted?—Mail'd archangels sent To wither up the strength of kings with death? —I tell you, if these marvels have been done, 'Twas for the wearied and th' oppress'd of men. They needed such!—And generous faith hath power By her prevailing spirit, e'en yet to work Deliverances, whose tale shall live with those Of the great elder-time!—Be of good heart! Who is forsaken?—He that gives the thought A place within his breast!—'Tis not for you. —Know ye this banner? Cits. (murmuring to each other.) Is she not inspired? Doth not Heaven call us by her fervent voice? Xim. Know ye this banner? Cit. 'Tis the Cid's. Xim. The Cid's! Who breathes that name but in th' exulting tone Which the heart rings to?—Why, the very wind, As it swells out the noble standard's fold, Hath a triumphant sound!—The Cid's!—it moved Even as a sign of victory through the land, From the free skies ne'er stooping to a foe! Old Cit. Can ye still pause, my brethren? Oh! that youth Through this worn frame were kindling once again! Xim. Ye linger still? Upon this very air, He that was born in happy hour for Spain, Pour'd forth his conquering spirit! 'Twas the breeze From your own mountains which came down to wave This banner of his battles, as it droop'd Above the champion's deathbed. Nor even then Its tale of glory closed. They made no moan O'er the dead hero, and no dirge was sung, But the deep tambour and shrill horn of war Told when the mighty pass'd! They wrapt him not With the pale shroud, but braced the warrior's form In war array, and on his barbed steed, As for a triumph, rear'd him; marching forth In the hush'd midnight from Valencia's walls, Beleaguer'd then, as now. All silently The stately funeral moved. But who was he That follow'd, charging on the tall white horse, And with the solemn standard, broad and pale, Waving in sheets of snowlight? And the cross, The bloody cross, far-blazing from his shield, And the fierce meteor-sword? They fled, they fled, The kings of Afric, with their countless hosts, Were dust in his red path. The scimitar Was shiver'd as a reed;—for in that hour The warrior-saint that keeps the watch for Spain, Was arm'd betimes. And o'er that fiery field The Cid's high banner stream'd all joyously, For still its lord was there. Cits. (rising tumultuously.) Even unto death Again it shall be follow'd! Xim. Will he see The noble stem hewn down, the beacon-light Which from his house for ages o'er the land Hath shone through cloud and storm, thus quench'd at once? Will he not aid his children in the hour Of this their utmost peril?—Awful power Is with the holy dead, and there are times When the tomb hath no chain they cannot burst! Is it a thing forgotten how he woke From its deep rest of old; remembering Spain In her great danger? At the night's mid-watch How Leon started, when the sound was heard That shook her dark and hollow-echoing streets, As with the heavy tramp of steel-clad men, By thousands marching through. For he had risen! The Campeador was on his march again, And in his arms, and follow'd by his hosts Of shadowy spearmen. He had left the world From which we are dimly parted, and gone forth, And call'd his buried warriors from their sleep, Gathering them round him to deliver Spain; For Afric was upon her. Morning broke, Day rush'd through clouds of battle; but at eve Our God had triumph'd, and the rescued land Sent up a shout of victory from the field, That rock'd her ancient mountains. The Cits. Arm! to arms! On to our chief! We have strength within us yet To die with our blood roused! Now, be the word For the Cid's house! [They begin to arm themselves. Xim. Ye know his battle song? The old rude strain wherewith his bands went forth To strike down Paynim swords! [She sings. THE CID'S BATTLE SONG. The Moor is on his way, With the tambour peal and the tecbir-shout, And the horn o'er the blue seas ringing out, He hath marshall'd his dark array! Shout through the vine-clad land! That her sons on all their hills may hear, And sharpen the point of the red wolf-spear, And the sword for the brave man's hand! [The Citizens join in the song, while they continue arming themselves. Banners are in the field! The chief must rise from his joyous board, And turn from the feast ere the wine be pour'd, And take up his father's shield! The Moor is on his way! Let the peasant leave his olive-ground, And the goats roam wild through the pine-woods round! There is nobler work to-day! Send forth the trumpet's call! Till the bridegroom cast the goblet down, And the marriage-robe, and the flowery crown; And arm in the banquet-hall! And stay the funeral train: Bid the chanted mass be hush'd awhile, And the bier laid down in the holy aisle, And the mourners girt for Spain. [They take up the banner and follow Ximena out. Their voices are heard gradually dying away at a distance. Ere night must swords be red! It is not an hour for knells and tears, But for helmets braced, and serried spears! To-morrow for the dead! The Cid is in array! His steed is barded, Barded, caparisoned for battle. his plume waves high, His banner is up in the sunny sky, Now, joy for the Cross to-day! Scene VII. —The Walls of the City. The Plains beneath, with the Moorish Camp and Army. Gonzalez—Garcias—Hernandez. (A wild sound of Moorish Music heard from below.) Her. What notes are these in their deep mournfulness So strangely wild? Gar. 'Tis the shrill melody Of the Moor's ancient death-song. Well I know The rude barbaric sound; but, till this hour, It seem'd not fearful.—Now, a shuddering chill Comes o'er me with its tones.—Lo! from yon tent They lead the noble boys! Her. The young, and pure, And beautiful victims!—'Tis on things like these We cast our hearts in wild idolatry, Sowing the winds with hope!—Yet this is well, Thus brightly crown'd with life's most gorgeous flowers, And all unblemish'd, earth should offer up Her treasures unto Heaven! Gar. (to Gonzalez.) My chief, the Moor Hath led your children forth. Gon. (starting.) Are my sons there? I knew they could not perish; for yon Heaven Would ne'er behold it!—Where is he that said I was no more a father?—They look changed— Pallid and worn, as from a prison-house! Or is't mine eye sees dimly?—But their steps Seem heavy, as with pain.—I hear the clank— Oh God! their limbs are fetter'd! Abd. (coming forward beneath the walls.) Christian! look Once more upon thy children. There is yet One moment for the trembling of the sword; Their doom is still with thee. Gon. Why should this man So mock us with the semblance of our kind? —Moor! Moor! thou dost too daringly provoke, In thy bold cruelty, th' all-judging One, Who visits for such things!—Hast thou no sense Of thy frail nature?—'Twill be taught thee yet, And darkly shall the anguish of my soul, Darkly and heavily, pour itself on thine, When thou shalt cry for mercy from the dust, And be denied! Abd. Nay, is it not thyself, That hast no mercy and no love within thee? These are thy sons, the nurslings of thy house; Speak! must they live or die? Gon. (in violent emotion.) Is it Heaven's will To try the dust it kindles for a day, With infinite agony!—How have I drawn This chastening on my head!—They bloom'd around me, And my heart grew too fearless in its joy, Glorying in their bright promise!—If we fall, Is there no pardon for our feebleness? [Hernandez, without speaking, holds up a cross before him. Abd. Speak! Gon. (snatching the cross, and lifting it up.) Let the earth be shaken through its depths, But this must triumph! Abd. (coldly.) Be it as thou wilt. —Unsheath the scimitar! [To his guards. Gar. (to Gonzalez.) Away, my chief! This is your place no longer. There are things No human heart, though battle-proof as yours, Unmadden'd may sustain. Gon. Be still! I have now No place on earth but this! Alph. (from beneath.) Men! give me way, That I may speak forth once before I die! Gar. The princely boy!—how gallantly his brow Wears its high nature in the face of death! Alph. Father! Gon. My son! my son!—Mine eldest-born! Alph. Stay but upon the ramparts! Fear thou not —There is good courage in me: oh! my father! I will not shame thee!—only let me fall Knowing thine eye looks proudly on thy child, So shall my heart have strength. Gon. Would, would to God, That I might die for thee, my noble boy! Alphonso, my fair son! Alph. Could I have lived, I might have been a warrior!—Now, farewell! But look upon me still!—I will not blench When the keen sabre flashes—Mark me well! Mine eyelids shall not quiver as it falls, So thou wilt look upon me! Gar. (to Gonzalez.) Nay, my lord! We must begone!—Thou canst not bear it! Gon. Peace! —Who hath told thee how much man's heart can bear? —Lend me thine arm—my brain whirls fearfully— How thick the shades close round!—my boy! my boy! Where art thou in this gloom? Gar. Let us go hence! This is a dreadful moment! Gon. Hush!—what saidst thou? Now let me look on him!—Dost thou see aught Through the dull mist which wraps us? Gar. I behold— O! for a thousand Spaniards! to rush down— Gon. Thou seest—My heart stands still to hear thee speak! —There seems a fearful hush upon the air, As 'twere the dead of night! Gar. The hosts have closed Around the spot in stillness. Through the spears, Ranged thick and motionless, I see him not; —But now— Gon. He bade me keep mine eye upon him, And all is darkness round me!—Now? Gar. A sword, A sword, springs upward, like a lightning burst, Through the dark serried mass!—Its cold blue glare Is wavering to and fro—'tis vanish'd—hark! Gon. I heard it, yes!—I heard the dull dead sound That heavily broke the silence!—Didst thou speak? —I lost thy words—come nearer! Gar. 'Twas—'tis past!— The sword fell then! Her. (with exultation.) Flow forth, thou noble blood! Fount of Spain's ransom and deliverance, flow Uncheck'd and brightly forth!—Thou kingly stream! Blood of our heroes! blood of martyrdom! Which through so many warrior-hearts hast pour'd Thy fiery currents, and hast made our hills Free, by thine own free offering!—Bathe the land, But there thou shalt not sink!—Our very air Shall take thy colouring, and our loaded skies O'er th' infidel hang dark and ominous, With battle-hues of thee!—And thy deep voice Rising above them to the judgment-seat Shall call a burst of gather'd vengeance down, To sweep th' oppressor from us!—For thy wave Hath made his guilt run o'er! Gon. (endeavouring to rouse himself.) 'Tis all a dream! There is not one—no hand on earth could harm That fair boy's graceful head!—Why look you thus? Abd. (pointing to Carlos.) Christian! e'en yet thou hast a son! Gon. E'en yet! Car. My father! take me from these fearful men! Wilt thou not save me, father? Gon. (attempting to unsheath his sword.) Is the strength From mine arm shiver'd?—Garcias, follow me! Gar. Whither, my chief? Gon. Why, we can die as well On yonder plain,—ay, a spear's thrust will do The little that our misery doth require, Sooner than e'en this anguish! Life is best Thrown from us in such moments. [Voices heard at a distance. Her. Hush! what strain Floats on the wind? Gar. 'Tis the Cid's battle-song! What marvel hath been wrought? [Voices approaching heard in chorus. The Moor is on his way! With the tambour peal and the tecbir-shout, And the horn o'er the blue seas ringing out; He hath marshall'd his dark array! [Ximena enters, followed by the Citizens, with the Banner. Xim. Is it too late?—My father, these are men Through life and death prepared to follow thee Beneath this banner!—Is their zeal too late? —Oh! there's a fearful history on thy brow! What hast thou seen? Gar. It is not all too late. Xim. My brothers! Her. All is well. (To Garcias.) Hush! would'st thou chill That which hath sprung within them, as a flame From th' altar-embers mounts in sudden brightness? I say, 'tis not too late, ye men of Spain! On to the rescue! Xim. Bless me, O my father! And I will hence, to aid thee with my prayers, Sending my spirit with thee through the storm Lit up by flashing swords! Gon. (falling upon her neck.) Hath aught been spared? Am I not all bereft?—Thou'rt left me still! Mine own, my loveliest one, thou'rt left me still! Farewell!—thy father's blessing, and thy God's, Be with thee, my Ximena! Xim. Fare thee well! If e'er thy steps turn homeward from the field, The voice is hush'd that still hath welcomed thee, Think of me in thy victory! Her. Peace! no more! This is no time to melt our nature down To a soft stream of tears!—Be of strong heart! Give me the banner! Swell the song again! The Cits. Ere night must swords be red! It is not an hour for knells and tears, But for helmets braced and serried spears! —To-morrow for the dead! [Exeunt omnes. Scene VIII. —Before the Altar of a Church. Elmina rises from the steps of the Altar. Elm. The clouds are fearful that o'erhang thy ways, Oh, thou mysterious Heaven!—It cannot be That I have drawn the vials of thy wrath, To burst upon me through the lifting up Of a proud heart, elate in happiness! No! in my day's full noon, for me life's flowers But wreath'd a cup of trembling; and the love, The boundless love, my spirit was form'd to bear, Hath ever, in its place of silence, been A trouble and a shadow, tinging thought With hues too deep for joy!—I never look'd On my fair children, in their buoyant mirth Or sunny sleep, when all the gentle air Seem'd glowing with their quiet blessedness, But o'er my soul there came a shudd'ring sense Of earth, and its pale changes; ev'n like that Which vaguely mingles with our glorious dreams— A restless and disturbing consciousness That the bright things must fade!—How have I shrunk From the dull murmur of th' unquiet voice, With its low tokens of mortality, Till my heart fainted 'midst their smiles!—their smiles! —Where are those glad looks now?—Could they go down, With all their joyous light, that seem'd not earth's, To the cold grave? — My children! — righteous Heaven! There floats a dark remembrance o'er my brain Of one who told me, with relentless eye, That this should be the hour! [Ximena enters. Xim. They are gone forth Unto the rescue!—strong in heart and hope, Faithful, though few!—My mother, let thy prayers Call on the land's good saints to lift once more The sword and cross that sweep the field for Spain, As in old battle; so thine arms e'en yet May clasp thy sons!—For me, my part is done! The flame which dimly might have linger'd yet A little while, hath gather'd all its rays Brightly to sink at once; and it is well! The shadows are around me; to thy heart Fold me, that I may die. Elm. My child!—What dream Is on thy soul?—Even now thine aspect wears Life's brightest inspiration! Xim. Death's! Elm. Away! Thine eye hath starry clearness; and thy cheek Doth glow beneath it with a richer hue Than tinged its earliest flower! Xim. It well may be! There are far deeper and far warmer hues Than those which draw their colouring from the founts Of youth, or health, or hope. Elm. Nay, speak not thus! There's that about thee shining which would send E'en through my heart a sunny glow of joy, Were't not for these sad words. The dim cold air And solemn light, which wrap these tombs and shrines As a pale gleaming shroud, seem kindled up With a young spirit of ethereal hope Caught from thy mien!—Oh no! this is not death! Xim. Why should not He, whose touch dissolves our chain, Put on his robes of beauty when he comes As a deliverer?—He hath many forms, They should not all be fearful!—If his call Be but our gathering to that distant land For whose sweet waters we have pined with thirst, Why should not its prophetic sense be borne Into the heart's deep stillness, with a breath Of summer-winds, a voice of melody, Solemn, yet lovely?—Mother, I depart!— Be it thy comfort, in the after-days, That thou hast seen me thus! Elm. Distract me not With such wild fears! Can I bear on with life When thou art gone?—Thy voice, thy step, thy smile, Pass'd from my path?—Alas! even now thine eye Is changed—thy cheek is fading! Xim. Ay, the clouds Of the dim hour are gathering o'er my sight, And yet I fear not, for the God of Help Comes in that quiet darkness!—It may soothe Thy woes, my mother! if I tell thee now With what glad calmness I behold the veil Falling between me and the world, wherein My heart so ill hath rested. Elm. Thine! Xim. Rejoice For her, that, when the garland of her life Was blighted, and the springs of hope were dried, Received her summons hence; and had no time, Bearing the canker at th' impatient heart, To wither, sorrowing for that gift of Heaven, Which lent one moment of existence light, That dimm'd the rest for ever! Elm. How is this? My child, what mean'st thou? Xim. Mother! I have loved, And been beloved!—the sunbeam of an hour, Which gave life's hidden treasures to mine eye, As they lay shining in their secret founts, Went out and left them colourless.—'Tis past— And what remains on earth?—the rainbow mist, Through which I gazed, hath melted, and my sight Is clear'd to look on all things as they are!— But this is far too mournful!—Life's dark gift Hath fall'n too early and too cold upon me!— Therefore I would go hence! Elm. And thou hast loved Unknown— Xim. Oh! pardon, pardon that I veil'd My thoughts from thee! — But thou hadst woes enough, And mine came o'er me when thy soul had need Of more than mortal strength!—For I had scarce Given the deep consciousness that I was loved A treasure's place within my secret heart, When earth's brief joy went from me! 'Twas at morn I saw the warriors to their field go forth, And he—my chosen—was there amongst the rest, With his young, glorious brow!—I look'd again— The strife grew dark beneath me—but his plume Waved free above the lances. Yet again— It had gone down! and steeds were trampling o'er The spot to which mine eyes were riveted, Till blinded by th' intenseness of their gaze!— And then—at last—I hurried to the gate, And met him there!—I met him!—on his shield, And with his cloven helm, and shiver'd sword, And dark hair steep'd in blood!—They bore him past— Mother!—I saw his face!—Oh! such a death Works fearful changes on the fair of earth, The pride of woman's eye! Elm. Sweet daughter, peace! Wake not the dark remembrance; for thy frame— Xim. There will be peace ere long. I shut my heart, Even as a tomb, o'er that lone silent grief, That I might spare it thee!—But now the hour Is come when that which would have pierced thy soul Shall be its healing balm. Oh! weep thou not, Save with a gentle sorrow! Elm. Must it be? Art thou indeed to leave me? Xim. (exultingly.) Be thou glad! I say, rejoice above thy favour'd child! Joy, for the soldier when his field is fought, Joy, for the peasant when his vintage-task Is closed at eve!—But most of all for her, Who, when her life had changed its glittering robes For the dull garb of sorrow, which doth cling So heavily around the journeyers on, Cast down its weight—and slept! Elm. Alas! thine eye Is wandering—yet how brightly!—Is this death, Or some high wondrous vision?—Speak, my child! How is it with thee now? Xim. (wildly.) I see it still! 'Tis floating, like a glorious cloud on high, My father's banner!—Hear'st thou not a sound? The trumpet of Castile?—Praise, praise to Heaven! —Now may the weary rest!—Be still!—Who calls The night so fearful?— [She dies. Elm. No! she is not dead!— Ximena!—speak to me!—Oh yet a tone From that sweet voice, that I may gather in One more remembrance of its lovely sound, Ere the deep silence fall!—What, is all hush'd?— No, no!—it cannot be!—How should we bear The dark misgivings of our souls, if Heaven Left not such beings with us?—But is this Her wonted look?—too sad a quiet lies On its dim fearful beauty!—Speak, Ximena! Speak!—my heart dies within me!—She is gone, With all her blessed smiles!—my child! my child! Where art thou?—Where is that which answer'd me, From thy soft-shining eyes?—Hush! doth she move? —One light lock seem'd to tremble on her brow, As a pulse throbb'd beneath;—'twas but the voice Of my despair that stirr'd it!—She is gone! [She throws herself on the body. Gonzalez enters, alone, and wounded. Elm. (rising as he approaches.) I must not now be scorn'd!—No, not a look, A whisper of reproach!—Behold my woe!— Thou canst not scorn me now! Gon. Hast thou heard all? Elm. Thy daughter on my bosom laid her head, And pass'd away to rest.—Behold her there, Even such as death hath made her! Gon. (bending over Ximena's body.) Thou art gone A little while before me, oh, my child! Why should the traveller weep to part with those That scarce an hour will reach their promised land Ere he too cast his pilgrim staff away, And spread his couch beside them? Elm. Must it be Henceforth enough that once a thing so fair Had its bright place amongst us?—Is this all Left for the years to come?—We will not stay! Earth's chain each hour grows weaker. Gon. (still gazing upon Ximena.) And thou'rt laid To slumber in the shadow, blessed child! Of a yet stainless altar, and beside A sainted warrior's tomb!—Oh, fitting place For thee to yield thy pure heroic soul Back unto him that gave it!—And thy cheek Yet smiles in its bright paleness! Elm. Hadst thou seen The look with which she pass'd! Gon. (still bending over her.) Why, 'tis almost Like joy to view thy beautiful repose! The faded image of that perfect calm Floats, e'en as long-forgotten music, back Into my weary heart!—No dark wild spot On thy clear brow doth tell of bloody hands That quench'd young life by violence!—We 've seen Too much of horror, in one crowded hour, To weep for aught so gently gather'd hence! —Oh! man leaves other traces! Elm. (suddenly starting.) It returns On my bewilder'd soul?—Went ye not forth Unto the rescue?—And thou'rt here alone! —Where are my sons? Gon. (solemnly.) We were too late! Elm. Too late! Hast thou nought else to tell me? Gon. I brought back From that last field the banner of my sires, And my own death-wound. Elm. Thine! Gon. Another hour Shall hush its throbs for ever. I go hence, And with me— Elm. No!—Man could not lift his hands— —Where hast thou left thy sons? Gon. I have no sons. Elm. What hast thou said? Gon. That now there lives not one To wear the glory of mine ancient house, When I am gone to rest. Elm. (throwing herself on the ground, and speaking in a low hurried voice.) In one brief hour, all gone!—and such a death! —I see their blood gush forth!—their graceful heads— —Take the dark vision from me, oh, my God! And such a death for them!—I was not there! They were but mine in beauty and in joy, Not in that mortal anguish!—All, all gone! —Why should I struggle more?—What is this Power, Against whose might, on all sides pressing us, We strive with fierce impatience, which but lays Our own frail spirits prostrate? [After a long pause. Now I know Thy hand, my God!—and they are soonest crush'd That most withstand it!—I resist no more. [She rises.A light, a light springs up from grief and death, Which with its solemn radiance doth reveal Why we have thus been tried! Gon. Then I may still Fix my last look on thee, in holy love, Parting, but yet with hope! Elm. (falling at his feet.) Canst thou forgive? —Oh, I have driven the arrow to thy heart, That should have buried it within mine own, And borne the pang in silence!—I have cast Thy life's fair honour, in my wild despair, As an unvalued gem upon the waves, Whence thou hast snatch'd it back, to bear from earth, All stainless, on thy breast.—Well hast thou done— But I—canst thou forgive? Gon. Within this hour I've stood upon that verge whence mortals fall, And learn'd how'tis with one whose sight grows dim, And whose foot trembles on the gulf's dark side, —Death purifies all feeling—We will part In pity and in love. Elm. Death!—And thou too Art on thy way!—Oh, joy for thee, high heart! Glory and joy for thee!—The day is closed, And well and nobly hast thou borne thyself Through its long battle-toils, though many swords Have enter'd thine own soul!—But on my head Recoil the fierce invokings of despair, And I am left far distanced in the race. The lonely one of earth!—Ay, this is just. I am not worthy that upon my breast In this, thine hour of vict'ry, thou should'st yield Thy spirit unto God! Gon. Thou art! thou art! Oh! a life's love, a heart's long faithfulness, Even in the presence of eternal things, Wearing their chasten'd beauty all undimm'd, Assert their lofty claims; and these are not For one dark hour to cancel!—We are here, Before that altar which received the vows Of our unbroken youth, and meet it is For such a witness, in the sight of Heaven, And in the face of death, whose shadowy arm Comes dim between us, to record th' exchange Of our tried hearts' forgiveness.—Who are they, That in one path have journey'd, needing not Forgiveness at its close? [A Citizen enters hastily. Cit. The Moors! the Moors! Gon. How! is the city storm'd? O righteous Heaven! for this I look'd not yet! Hath all been done in vain? Why, then, 'tis time For prayer, and then to rest! Cit. The sun shall set, And not a Christian voice be left for prayer, To-night, within Valencia. Round our walls The paynim host is gathering for th' assault, And we have none to guard them. Gon. Then my place Is here no longer. I had hoped to die E'en by the altar and the sepulchre Of my brave sires; but this was not to be! Give me my sword again, and lead me hence Back to the ramparts. I have yet an hour, And it hath still high duties. Now, my wife! Thou mother of my children—of the dead— Whom I name unto thee in steadfast hope— Farewell! Elm. No, not farewell! My soul hath risen To mate itself with thine; and by thy side, Amidst the hurling lances, I will stand, As one on whom a brave man's love hath been Wasted not utterly. Gon. I thank thee, Heaven! That I have tasted of the awful joy Which thou hast given, to temper hours like this With a deep sense of thee, and of thine ends In these dread visitings! (To Elmina.) We will not part, But with the spirit's parting. Elm. One farewell To her, that, mantled with sad loveliness, Doth slumber at our feet! My blessed child! Oh! in thy heart's affliction thou wert strong, And holy courage did pervade thy woe, As light the troubled waters! Be at peace! Thou whose bright spirit made itself the soul Of all that were around thee! And thy life E'en then was struck and withering at the core! Farewell! thy parting look hath on me fallen, E'en as a gleam of heaven, and I am now More like what thou hast been. My soul is hush'd, For a still sense of purer worlds hath sunk And settled on its depths with that last smile Which from thine eye shone forth. Thou hast not lived In vain—my child, farewell! Gon. Surely for thee Death had no sting, Ximena! We are blest, To learn one secret of the shadowy pass, From such an aspect's calmness. Yet once more I kiss thy pale young cheek, my broken flower! In token of th' undying love and hope Whose land is far away. [Exeunt. Scene IX. —The Walls of the City. Hernandez.—A few Citizens gathered round him. Her. Why, men have cast the treasures, which their lives Had been worn down in gathering, on the pyre, Ay, at their household hearths have lit the brand, Even from that shrine of quiet love to bear The flame which gave their temples and their homes, In ashes, to the winds! They have done this, Making a blasted void where once the sun Look'd upon lovely dwellings; and from earth Razing all record that on such a spot Childhood hath sprung, age faded, misery wept, And frail humanity knelt before her God; They have done this, in their free nobleness, Rather than see the spoiler's tread pollute Their holy places. Praise, high praise be theirs, Who have left man such lessons! And these things, Made your own hills their witnesses! The sky, Whose arch bends o'er you, and the seas, wherein Your rivers pour their gold, rejoicing saw The altar, and the birthplace, and the tomb, And all memorials of man's heart and faith, Thus proudly honour'd! Be ye not outdone By the departed! Though the godless foe Be close upon us, we have power to snatch The spoils of victory from him. Be but strong! A few bright torches and brief moments yet Shall baffle his flush'd hope, and we may die, Laughing him unto scorn. Rise, follow me, And thou, Valencia! triumph in thy fate, The ruin, not the yoke, and make thy towers A beacon unto Spain! Cits. We'll follow thee! Alas! for our fair city, and the homes Wherein we rear'd our children! But away! The Moor shall plant no crescent o'er our fanes! Voice. (from a Tower on the Walls.) Succours!—Castile! Castile! Cits. (rushing to the spot.) It is even so! Now blessing be to Heaven, for we are saved!—Castile! Castile! Voice. (from the Tower.) Line after line of spears, Lance after lance, upon th' horizon's verge, Like festal lights from cities bursting up, Doth skirt the plain. In faith, a noble host! Another Voice. The Moor hath turn'd him from our walls, to front Th' advancing might of Spain! Cits. (shouting.) Castile! Castile! [Gonzalez enters, supported by Elmina and a Citizen. Gon. What shouts of joy are these? Her. Hail! chieftain, hail! Thus, even in death, 'tis given thee to receive The conqueror's crown! Behold our God hath heard, And arm'd himself with vengeance! Lo! they come! The lances of Castile! Gon. I knew, I knew Thou would'st not utterly, my God, forsake Thy servant in his need! My blood and tears Have not sunk vainly to th' attesting earth! Praise to thee, thanks and praise, that I have lived To see this hour! Elm. And I, too, bless thy name, Though thou hast proved me unto agony! O God!—thou God of chastening! Voice. (from the Tower.) They move on! I see the royal banner in the air, With its emblazon'd towers! Gon. Go, bring ye forth The banner of the Cid, and plant it here, To stream above me, for an answering sign That the good cross doth hold its lofty place Within Valencia still! What see ye now? Her. I see a kingdom's might upon its path, Moving, in terrible magnificence, Unto revenge and victory! With the flash Of knightly swords, up-springing from the ranks, As meteors from a still and gloomy deep, And with the waving of ten thousand plumes, Like a land's harvest in the autumn-wind, And with fierce light, which is not of the sun, But flung from sheets of steel—it comes, it comes, The vengeance of our God! Gon. I hear it now, The heavy tread of mail-clad multitudes, Like thunder showers upon the forest paths. Her. Ay, earth knows well the omen of that sound, And she hath echoes, like a sepulchre's, Pent in her secret hollows, to respond Unto the step of death! Gon. Hark! how the wind Swells proudly with the battle-march of Spain! Now the heart feels its power!—A little while Grant me to live, my God! What pause is this? Her. A deep and dreadful one!—the serried files Level their spears for combat; now the hosts Look on each other in their brooding wrath, Silent, and face to face. Voices heard Without, Chanting. Calm on the bosom of thy God, Fair spirit! rest thee now! E'en while with ours thy footsteps trode His seal was on thy brow. Dust, to its narrow house beneath! Soul, to its place on high! They that have seen thy look in death, No more may fear to die. Elm. (to Gonzalez.) It is the death-hymn o'er thy daughter's bier! But I am calm; and e'en like gentle winds, That music, through the stillness of my heart, Sends mournful peace. Gon. Oh! well those solemn tones Accord with such an hour, for all her life Breath'd of a hero's soul! [A sound of trumpets and shouting from the plain Her. Now, now they close! Hark! what a dull dead sound Is in the Moorish war-shout!—I have known Such tones prophetic oft.—The shock is given— Lo! they have placed their shields before their hearts, And lower'd their lances with the streamers on, And on their steeds bent forward!—God for Spain! The first bright sparks of battle have been struck From spear to spear, across the gleaming field!— There is no sight on which the blue sky looks To match with this!—'Tis not the gallant crests, Nor banners with their glorious blazonry; The very nature and high soul of man Doth now reveal itself? Gon. Oh, raise me up, That I may look upon the noble scene!— It will not be!—That this dull mist would pass A moment from my sight!—Whence rose that shout, As in fierce triumph? Her. (clasping his hands.) Must I look on this? The banner sinks—'tis taken! Gon. Whose? Her. Castile's! Gon. Oh, God of Battles! Elm. Calm thy noble heart! Thou wilt not pass away without thy meed. Nay, rest thee on my bosom. Her. Cheer thee yet! Our knights have spurr'd to rescue.—There is now A whirl, a mingling of all terrible things, Yet more appalling than the fierce distinctness Wherewith they moved before!—I see tall plumes All wildly tossing o'er the battle's tide, Sway'd by the wrathful motion, and the press Of desperate men, as cedar-boughs by storms. Many a white streamer there is dyed with blood, Many a false corslet broken, many a shield Pierced through!—Now, shout for Santiago, shout! Lo! javelins with a moment's brightness cleave The thickening dust, and barbed steeds go down With their helm'd riders!—Who, but One, can tell How spirits part amidst that fearful rush And trampling on of furious multitudes? Gon. Thou'rt silent!—See'st thou more?—My soul grows dark. Her. And dark and troubled, as an angry sea, Dashing some gallant armament in scorn Against its rocks, is all on which I gaze!— I can but tell thee how tall spears are cross'd, And lances seem to shiver, and proud helms To lighten with the stroke!—But round the spot, Where, like a storm-fell'd mast, our standard sank, The heart of battle burns. Gon. Where is that spot? Her. It is beneath the lonely tuft of palms, That lift their green heads o'er the tumult still, In calm and stately grace. Gon. There didst thou say? Then God is with us, and we must prevail! For on that spot they died!—My children's blood Calls on th' avenger thence! Elm. They perish'd there! —And the bright locks that waved so joyously To the free winds, lay trampled and defiled Even on that place of death!—Oh, Merciful! Hush the dark thought within me! Her. (with sudden exultation.) Who is he, On the white steed, and with the castled helm, And the gold-broider'd mantle, which doth float E'en like a sunny cloud above the fight; And the pale cross, which from his breast-plate gleams With star-like radiance? Gon. (eagerly.) Didst thou say the cross? Her. On his mail'd bosom shines a broad white cross, And his long plumage through the dark'ning air Streams like a snow-wreath. Gon. That should be— Her. The king! —Was it not told us how he sent, of late, To the Cid's tomb, e'en for the silver cross, Which he who slumbers there was wont to bind O'er his brave heart in fight? Gon. (springing up joyfully.) My king! my king! Now all good saints for Spain!—My noble king! And thou art there!—That I might look once more Upon thy face!—But yet I thank thee, Heaven! That thou hast sent him, from my dying hands Thus to receive his city! [He sinks back into Elmina's arms. Her. He hath clear'd A pathway 'midst the combat, and the light Follows his charge through yon close living mass, E'en as a gleam on some proud vessel's wake Along the stormy waters!—'Tis redeem'd— The castled banner!—It is flung once more In joy and glory, to the sweeping winds! —There seems a wavering through the paynim hosts— Castile doth press them sore—Now, now rejoice! Gon. What hast thou seen? Her. Abdullah falls! He falls! The man of blood!—the spoiler!—he hath sunk In our king's path!—Well hath that royal sword Avenged thy cause, Gonzalez! They give way, The Crescent's van is broken!—On the hills And the dark pine-woods may the infidel Call vainly, in his agony of fear, To cover him from vengeance!—Lo! they fly! They of the forest and the wilderness Are scatter'd, e'en as leaves upon the wind! Woe to the sons of Afric!—Let the plains, And the vine-mountains, and Hesperian seas, Take their dead unto them!—that blood shall wash Our soil from stains of bondage. Gon. (attempting to raise himself.) Set me free! Come with me forth, for I must greet my king, After his battle-field! Her. Oh, blest in death! Chosen of Heaven, farewell!—Look on the Cross, And part from earth in peace! Gon. Now, charge once more! God is with Spain, and Santiago's sword Is reddening all the air!—Shout forth “Castile!” The day is ours!—I go; but fear ye not! For Afric's lance is broken, and my sons Have won their first good field! [He dies. Elm. Look on me yet! Speak one farewell, my husband!—must thy voice Enter my soul no more!—Thine eye is fix'd— Now is my life uprooted,—And 'tis well. [A sound of triumphant music is heard, and many Castilian Knights and Soldiers enter. A Cit. Hush your triumphal sounds, although ye come E'en as deliverers!—But the noble dead, And those that mourn them, claim from human hearts Deep silent reverence. Elm. (rising proudly.) No, swell forth, Castile! Thy trumpet-music, till the seas and heavens, And the deep hills, give every stormy note Echoes to ring through Spain!—How, know ye not That all array'd for triumph, crown'd and robed With the strong spirit which hath saved the land, E'en now a conqueror to his rest is gone? —Fear not to break that sleep, but let the wind Swell on with victory's shout!—He will not hear— Hath earth a sound more sad? Her. Lift ye the dead, And bear him with the banner of his race Waving above him proudly, as it waved O'er the Cid's battles, to the tomb wherein His warrior-sires are gather'd. [They raise the body. Elm. Ay, 'tis thus Thou should'st be honour'd!—And I follow thee With an unfaltering and a lofty step, To that last home of glory. She that wears In her deep heart the memory of thy love, Shall thence draw strength for all things, till the God Whose hand around her hath unpeopled earth, Looking upon her still and chasten'd soul, Call it once more to thine! (To the Castilians.) Awake, I say, Tambour and trumpet, wake!—And let the land Through all her mountains hear your funeral peal —So should a hero pass to his repose. [Exeunt omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. IV. THE FOREST SANCTUARY. Ihr Plätze aller meiner stillen Freuden, Euch lass' ich hinter mir auf immer dar! So ist des Geistes Ruf an mich ergangen, Mich treibt nicht eitles, irdisches Verlangen. Die Jungfrau von Orleans. Long time against oppression have I fought, And for the native liberty of faith Have bled and suffer'd bonds. Remorse, a Tragedy. The following Poem is intended to describe the mental conflicts, as well as outward sufferings, of a Spaniard, who, flying from the religious persecutions of his own country, in the sixteenth century, takes refuge, with his child, in a North American forest. The story is supposed to be related by himself, amidst the wilderness which has afforded him an asylum. I The voices of my home!—I hear them still! They have been with me through the dreamy night— The blessed household voices, wont to fill My heart's clear depths with unalloy'd delight! I hear them still, unchanged:—though some from earth Are music parted, and the tones of mirth— Wild, silvery tones, that rang through days more bright! Have died in others,—yet to me they come, Singing of boyhood back—the voices of my home! II They call me through this hush of woods reposing, In the grey stillness of the summer morn; They wander by when heavy flowers are closing, And thoughts grow deep, and winds and stars are born; Even as a fount's remember'd gushings burst On the parch'd traveller in his hour of thirst, E'en thus they haunt me with sweet sounds, till worn By quenchless longings, to my soul I say— Oh! for the dove's swift wings, that I might flee away,— III And find mine ark!—yet whither?—I must bear A yearning heart within me to the grave. I am of those o'er whom a breath of air— Just darkening in its course the lake's bright wave, And sighing through the feathery canes—hath power To call up shadows, in the silent hour, From the dim past, as from a wizard's cave!— So must it be!—These skies above me spread, Are they my own soft skies?—Ye rest not here, my dead! IV Ye far amidst the southern flowers lie sleeping, Your graves all smiling in the sunshine clear, Save one! a blue, lone, distant main is sweeping High o'er one gentle head—ye rest not here!— 'Tis not the olive, with a whisper swaying, Not thy low ripplings, glassy water, playing Through my own chestnut groves, which fill mine ear; But the faint echoes in my breast that dwell, And for their birthplace moan, as moans the ocean-shell. V Peace!—I will dash these fond regrets to earth, Even as an eagle shakes the cumbering rain From his strong pinion. Thou that gavest me birth, And lineage, and once home,—my native Spain! My own bright land—my father's land—my child's! What hath thy son brought from thee to the wilds? He hath brought marks of torture and the chain, Traces of things which pass not as a breeze; A blighted name, dark thoughts, wrath, woe,—thy gifts are these! VI A blighted name!—I hear the winds of morn— Their sounds are not of this!—I hear the shiver Of the green reeds, and all the rustlings, borne From the high forest, when the light leaves quiver: Their sounds are not of this!—the cedars, waving, Lend it no tone: His wide savannahs laving, It is not murmur'd by the joyous river! What part hath mortal name, where God alone Speaks to the mighty waste, and through its heart is known? VII Is it not much that I may worship Him, With nought my spirit's breathings to control, And feel His presence in the vast, and dim, And whispery woods, where dying thunders roll From the far cat'racts?—Shall I not rejoice That I have learn'd at last to know His voice From man's?—I will rejoice!—my soaring soul Now hath redeem'd her birthright of the day, And won, through clouds, to Him, her own unfetter'd way! VIII And thou, my boy! that silent at my knee Dost lift to mine thy soft, dark, earnest eyes, Fill'd with the love of childhood, which I see Pure through its depths, a thing without disguise; Thou that hast breathed in slumber on my breast, When I have check'd its throbs to give thee rest, Mine own! whose young thoughts fresh before me rise! Is it not much that I may guide thy prayer, And circle thy glad soul with free and healthful air? IX Why should I weep on thy bright head, my boy? Within thy fathers' halls thou wilt not dwell, Nor lift their banner, with a warrior's joy, Amidst the sons of mountain chiefs, who fell For Spain of old.—Yet what if rolling waves Have borne us far from our ancestral graves? Thou shalt not feel thy bursting heart rebel, As mine hath done; nor bear what I have borne, Casting in falsehood's mould th' indignant brow of scorn. X This shall not be thy lot, my blessed child! I have not sorrow'd, struggled, lived in vain— Hear me! magnificent and ancient wild; And mighty rivers, ye that meet the main, As deep meets deep; and forests, whose dim shade The flood's voice, and the wind's, by swells pervade; Hear me!—'tis well to die, and not complain, Yet there are hours when the charged heart must speak, E'en in the desert's ear to pour itself, or break! XI I see an oak before me: it hath been The crown'd one of the woods; and might have flung Its hundred arms to heaven, still freshly green, But a wild vine around the stem hath clung, From branch to branch close wreaths of bondage throwing, Till the proud tree, before no tempest bowing, Hath shrunk and died those serpent-folds among. Alas! alas! what is it that I see? An image of man's mind, land of my sires, with thee! XII Yet art thou lovely!—Song is on thy hills— Oh, sweet and mournful melodies of Spain, That lull'd my boyhood, how your memory thrills The exile's heart with sudden-wakening pain! Your sounds are on the rocks:—That I might hear Once more the music of the mountaineer! And from the sunny vales the shepherd's strain Floats out, and fills the solitary place With the old tuneful names of Spain's heroic race. XIII But there was silence one bright, golden day, Through my own pine-hung mountains. Clear, yet lone, In the rich autumn light the vineyards lay, And from the fields the peasant's voice was gone; And the red grapes untrodden strew'd the ground, And the free flocks, untended, roam'd around:— Where was the pastor?—where the pipe's wild tone? Music and mirth were hush'd the hills among, While to the city's gates each hamlet pour'd its throng. XIV Silence upon the mountains! But within The city's gate a rush, a press, a swell Of multitudes, their torrent way to win; And heavy boomings of a dull deep bell, A dead pause following each—like that which parts The dash of billows, holding breathless hearts Fast in the hush of fear—knell after knell; And sounds of thickening steps, like thunder-rain That plashes on the roof of some vast echoing fane! XV What pageant's hour approach'd? The sullen gate Of a strong ancient prison-house was thrown Back to the day. And who, in mournful state, Came forth, led slowly o'er its threshold-stone? They that had learn'd, in cells of secret gloom, How sunshine is forgotten! They, to whom The very features of mankind were grown Things that bewilder'd! O'er their dazzled sight They lifted their wan hands, and cower'd before the light! XVI To this, man brings his brother! Some were there, Who, with their desolation, had entwined Fierce strength, and girt the sternness of despair Fast round their bosoms, even as warriors bind The breastplate on for fight; but brow and cheek Seem'd theirs a torturing panoply to speak! And there were some, from whom the very mind Had been wrung out:—they smiled—oh! startling smile, Whence man's high soul is fled! Where doth it sleep the while? XVII But onward moved the melancholy train, For their false creeds in fiery pangs to die. This was the solemn sacrifice of Spain— Heaven's offering from the land of chivalry! Through thousands, thousands of their race they moved— Oh! how unlike all others!—the beloved, The free, the proud, the beautiful! whose eye Grew fix'd before them, while a people's breath Was hush'd, and its one soul bound in the thought of death! XVIII It might be that, amidst the countless throng, There swell'd some heart with pity's weight oppress'd, For the wide stream of human love is strong; And woman, on whose fond and faithful breast Childhood is rear'd, and at whose knee the sigh Of its first prayer is breathed, she, too, was nigh. But life is dear, and the free footstep bless'd, And home a sunny place, where each may fill Some eye with glistening smiles,—and therefore all were still. XIX All still,—youth, courage, strength!—a winter laid, A chain of palsy cast, on might and mind! Still, as at noon a southern forest's shade They stood, those breathless masses of mankind; Still, as a frozen torrent!—but the wave Soon leaps to foaming freedom—they, the brave, Endured—they saw the martyr's place assign'd In the red flames—whence is the withering spell That numbs each human pulse?—they saw, and thought it well. XX And I, too, thought it well! That very morn From a far land I came, yet round me clung The spirit of my own. No hand had torn With a strong grasp away the veil which hung Between mine eyes and truth. I gazed, I saw Dimly, as through a glass. In silent awe I watch'd the fearful rites; and if there sprung One rebel feeling from its deep founts up, Shuddering, I flung it back, as guilt's own poison-cup. XXI But I was waken'd as the dreamers waken Whom the shrill trumpet and the shriek of dread Rouse up at midnight, when their walls are taken, And they must battle till their blood is shed On their own threshold-floor. A path for light Through my torn breast was shatter'd by the might Of the swift thunder-stroke—and freedom's tread Came in through ruins, late, yet not in vain, Making the blighted place all green with life again. XXII Still darkly, slowly, as a sullen mass Of cloud, o'ersweeping, without wind, the sky, Dream-like I saw the sad procession pass, And mark'd its victims with a tearless eye. They moved before me but as pictures, wrought Each to reveal some secret of man's thought, On the sharp edge of sad mortality, Till in his place came one—oh! could it be? My friend, my heart's first friend!—and did I gaze on thee? XXIII On thee! with whom in boyhood I had play'd, At the grape-gatherings, by my native streams; And to whose eye my youthful soul had laid Bare, as to Heaven's, its glowing world of dreams; And by whose side 'midst warriors I had stood, And in whose helm was brought—oh! earn'd with blood! The fresh wave to my lips, when tropic beams Smote on my fever'd brow!—Ay, years had pass'd, Severing our paths, brave friend!—and thus we met at last! XXIV I see it still—the lofty mien thou borest— On thy pale forehead sat a sense of power! The very look that once thou brightly worest, Cheering me onward through a fearful hour, When we were girt by Indian bow and spear, 'Midst the white Andes—even as mountain deer, Hemm'd in our camp—but through the javelin shower We rent our way, a tempest of despair! And thou—hadst thou but died with thy true brethren there! XXV I call the fond wish back—for thou hast perish'd More nobly far, my Alvar!—making known The might of truth; and be thy memory cherish'd With theirs, the thousands that around her throne Have pour'd their lives out smiling, in that doom Finding a triumph, if denied a tomb!— Ay, with their ashes hath the wind been sown, And with the wind their spirit shall be spread, Filling man's heart and home with records of the dead. XXVI Thou Searcher of the soul! in whose dread sight Not the bold guilt alone that mocks the skies, But the scarce-own'd, unwhisper'd thought of night, As a thing written with the sunbeam lies; Thou know'st—whose eye through shade and depth can see, That this man's crime was but to worship thee, Like those that made their hearts thy sacrifice, The call'd of yore—wont by the Saviour's side On the dim Olive-Mount to pray at eventide. XXVII For the strong spirit will at times awake, Piercing the mists that wrap her clay abode; And, born of thee, she may not always take Earth's accents for the oracles of God; And even for this—O dust, whose mask is power! Reed, that would'st be a scourge thy little hour! Spark, whereon yet the mighty hath not trod, And therefore thou destroyest!—where were flown Our hopes, if man were left to man's decree alone? XXVIII But this I felt not yet. I could but gaze On him, my friend; while that swift moment threw A sudden freshness back on vanish'd days, Like water-drops on some dim picture's hue; Calling the proud time up, when first I stood Where banners floated, and my heart's quick blood Sprang to a torrent as the clarion blew, And he—his sword was like a brother's worn, That watches through the field his mother's youngest born. XXIX But a lance met me in that day's career, Senseless I lay amidst th' o'ersweeping fight, Wak'ning at last—how full, how strangely clear, That scene on memory flash'd!—the shivery light, Moonlight, on broken shields—the plain of slaughter, The fountain-side—the low sweet sound of water— And Alvar bending o'er me—from the night Covering me with his mantle!—all the past Flow'd back—my soul's far chords all answer'd to the blast. XXX Till, in that rush of visions, I became As one that, by the bands of slumber wound, Lies with a powerless but all-thrilling frame, Intense in consciousness of sight and sound, Yet buried in a wildering dream which brings Loved faces round him, girt with fearful things! Troubled even thus I stood, but chain'd and bound On that familiar form mine eye to keep:— Alas! I might not fall upon his neck and weep! XXXI He pass'd me—and what next?—I look'd on two, Following his footsteps to the same dread place, For the same guilt—his sisters!—Well I knew The beauty on those brows, though each young face Was changed—so deeply changed!—a dungeon's air Is hard for loved and lovely things to bear; And ye, O daughters of a lofty race, Queen-like Theresa! radiant Inez!—flowers So cherish'd! were ye then but rear'd for those dark hours? XXXII A mournful home, young sisters! had ye left, With your lutes hanging hush'd upon the wall, And silence round the aged man, bereft Of each glad voice, once answering to his call. Alas, that lonely father! doom'd to pine For sounds departed in his life's decline, And, 'midst the shadowing banners of his hall, With his white hair to sit, and deem the name A hundred chiefs had borne, cast down by you to shame! XXXIII And woe for you, 'midst looks and words of love, And gentle hearts and faces, nursed so long! How had I seen you in your beauty move, Wearing the wreath, and listening to the song! —Yet sat, even then, what seem'd the crowd to shun, Half-veil'd upon the clear pale brow of one, And deeper thoughts than oft to youth belong, Thoughts, such as wake to evening's whispery sway, Within the drooping shade of her sweet eyelids lay. XXXIV And if she mingled with the festive train, It was but as some melancholy star Beholds the dance of shepherds on the plain, In its bright stillness present, though afar. Yet would she smile—and that, too, hath its smile— Circled with joy which reach'd her not the while, And bearing a lone spirit, not at war With earthly things, but o'er their form and hue Shedding too clear a light, too sorrowfully true. XXXV But the dark hours wring forth the hidden might Which hath lain bedded in the silent soul, A treasure all undreamt of;—as the night Calls out the harmonies of streams that roll Unheard by day. It seem'd as if her breast Had hoarded energies, till then suppress'd Almost with pain, and bursting from control, And finding first that hour their pathway free:— Could a rose brave the storm, such might her emblem be! XXXVI For the soft gloom whose shadow still had hung On her fair brow, beneath its garlands worn, Was fled; and fire, like prophecy's, had sprung Clear to her kindled eye. It might be scorn— Pride—sense of wrong—ay, the frail heart is bound By these at times, even as with adamant round, Kept so from breaking!—yet not thus upborn She moved, though some sustaining passion's wave Lifted her fervent soul—a sister for the brave! XXXVII And yet, alas! to see the strength which clings Round women in such hours!—a mournful sight, Though lovely!—an o'erflowing of the springs, The full springs of affection, deep as bright! And she, because her life is ever twined With other lives, and by no stormy wind May thence be shaken, and because the light Of tenderness is round her, and her eye Doth weep such passionate tears—therefore she thus can die. XXXVIII Therefore didst thou, through that heart-shaking scene, As through a triumph move; and cast aside Thine own sweet thoughtfulness for victory's mien, O faithful sister! cheering thus the guide, And friend, and brother of thy sainted youth, Whose hand had led thee to the source of truth, Where thy glad soul from earth was purified; Nor wouldst thou, following him through all the past, That he should see thy step grow tremulous at last. XXXIX For thou hadst made no deeper love a guest 'Midst thy young spirit's dreams, than that which grows Between the nurtured of the same fond breast, The shelter'd of one roof; and thus it rose Twined in with life.—How is it that the hours Of the same sport, the gathering early flowers Round the same tree, the sharing one repose, And mingling one first prayer in murmurs soft, From the heart's memory fade, in this world's breath so oft? XL But thee that breath had touch'd not; thee, nor him, The true in all things found!—and thou wert blest Even then, that no remember'd change could dim The perfect image of affection, press'd Like armour to thy bosom!—thou hadst kept Watch by thy brother's couch of pain, and wept, Thy sweet face covering with thy robe, when rest Fled from the sufferer; thou hadst bound his faith Unto thy soul;—one light, one hope ye chose—one death. XLI So didst thou pass on brightly!—but for her, Next in that path, how may her doom be spoken! All merciful! to think that such things were, And are, and seen by men with hearts unbroken! To think of that fair girl, whose path had been So strew'd with rose-leaves, all one fairy scene! And whose quick glance came ever as a token Of hope to drooping thought, and her glad voice As a free bird's in spring, that makes the woods rejoice! XLII And she to die!—she loved the laughing earth With such deep joy in its fresh leaves and flowers! Was not her smile even as the sudden birth Of a young rainbow, colouring vernal showers? Yes! but to meet her fawn-like step, to hear The gushes of wild song, so silvery clear, Which oft, unconsciously, in happier hours Flow'd from her lips, was to forget the sway Of Time and Death below, blight, shadow, dull decay! XLIII Could this change be?—the hour, the scene, where last I saw that form, came floating o'er my mind:— A golden vintage-eve; the heats were pass'd, And, in the freshness of the fanning wind, Her father sat where gleam'd the first faint star Through the lime-boughs; and with her light guitar, She, on the greensward at his feet reclined, In his calm face laugh'd up; some shepherd lay Singing, as childhood sings on the lone hills at play. XLIV And now—oh God!—the bitter fear of death, The sore amaze, the faint o'ershadowing dread, Had grasp'd her!—panting in her quick-drawn breath, And in her white lips quivering;—onward led, She look'd up with her dim bewilder'd eyes, And there smiled out her own soft brilliant skies, Far in their sultry southern azure spread, Glowing with joy, but silent!—still they smiled, Yet sent down no reprieve for earth's poor trembling child. XLV Alas! that earth had all too strong a hold, Too fast, sweet Inez! on thy heart, whose bloom Was given to early love, nor knew how cold The hours which follow. There was one, with whom, Young as thou wert, and gentle, and untried, Thou might'st, perchance, unshrinkingly have died: But he was far away;—and with thy doom Thus gathering, life grew so intensely dear, That all thy slight frame shook with its cold mortal fear! XLVI No aid!—thou too didst pass!—and all had pass'd, The fearful—and the desperate—and the strong! Some like the bark that rushes with the blast, Some like the leaf swept shiveringly along, And some as men, that have but one more field To fight, and then may slumber on their shield,— Therefore they arm in hope. But now the throng Roll'd on, and bore me with their living tide, Even as a bark wherein is left no power to guide. XLVII Wave swept on wave. We reach'd a stately square, Deck'd for the rites. An altar stood on high, And gorgeous, in the midst: a place for prayer, And praise, and offering. Could the earth supply No fruits, no flowers for sacrifice, of all Which on her sunny lap unheeded fall? No fair young finstling of the flock to die, As when before their God the patriarchs stood?— Look down! man brings thee, Heaven! his brother's guiltless blood! XLVIII Hear its voice, hear!—a cry goes up to thee, From the stain'd sod; make thou thy judgment known On him, the shedder!—let his portion be The fear that walks at midnight—give the moan In the wind haunting him, a power to say, “Where is thy brother?”—and the stars a ray To search and shake his spirit, when alone, With the dread splendour of their burning eyes! —So shall earth own thy will—mercy, not sacrifice! XLIX Sounds of triumphant praise!—the mass was sung— Voices that die not might have pour'd such strains! Through Salem's towers might that proud chant have rung When the Most High, on Syria's palmy plains, Had quell'd her foes!—so full it swept, a sea Of loud waves jubilant, and rolling free! —Oft when the wind, as through resounding fanes, Hath fill'd the choral forests with its power, Some deep tone brings me back the music of that hour. L It died away;—the incense-cloud was driven Before the breeze—the words of doom were said; And the sun faded mournfully from heaven: —He faded mournfully! and dimly red, Parting in clouds from those that look'd their last, And sigh'd—“Farewell, thou sun!”—Eve glow'd and pass'd— Night—midnight and the moon—came forth and shed Sleep, even as dew, on glen, wood, peopled spot— Save one—a place of death—and there men slumber'd not. LI 'Twas not within the city— but in sight Of the snow-crown'd sierras, freely sweeping, With many an eagle's eyrie on the height, And hunter's cabin, by the torrent peeping Far off: and vales between, and vineyards lay, With sound and gleam of waters on their way, And chestnut woods, that girt the happy sleeping In many a peasant-home!—the midnight sky Brought softly that rich world round those who came to die. LII The darkly-glorious midnight sky of Spain, Burning with stars!—What had the torches' glare To do beneath that temple, and profane Its holy radiance?—By their wavering flare, I saw beside the pyres—I see thee now, O bright Theresa! with thy lifted brow, And thy clasp'd hands, and dark eyes fill'd with prayer! And thee, sad Inez! bowing thy fair head, And mantling up thy face, all colourless with dread! LIII And Alvar, Alvar!—I beheld thee too, Pale, steadfast, kingly; till thy clear glance fell On that young sister; then perturb'd it grew, And all thy labouring bosom seem'd to swell With painful tenderness. Why came I there, That troubled image of my friend to bear Thence, for my after-years?—a thing to dwell In my heart's core, and on the darkness rise, Disquieting my dreams with its bright mournful eyes? LIV Why came I? oh! the heart's deep mystery!— Why In man's last hour doth vain affection's gaze Fix itself down on struggling agony, To the dimm'd eyeballs freezing as they glaze? It might be—yet the power to will seem'd o'er— That my soul yearn'd to hear his voice once more! But mine was fetter'd!—mute in strong amaze, I watch'd his features as the night-wind blew, And torch-light or the moon's pass'd o'er their marble hue. LV The trampling of a steed!—a tall white steed, Rending his fiery way the crowds among— A storm's way through a forest—came at speed, And a wild voice cried “Inez!” Swift she flung The mantle from her face, and gazed around, With a faint shriek at that familiar sound; And from his seat a breathless rider sprung, And dash'd off fiercely those who came to part, And rush'd to that pale girl, and clasp'd her to his heart. LVI And for a moment all around gave way To that full burst of passion!—on his breast, Like a bird panting yet from fear she lay, But blest—in misery's very lap—yet blest!— Oh love, love strong as death!—from such an hour Pressing out joy by thine immortal power; Holy and fervent love! had earth but rest For thee and thine, this world were all too fair! How could we thence be wean'd to die without despair? LVII But she—as falls a willow from the storm, O'er its own river streaming—thus reclined On the youth's bosom hung her fragile form, And clasping arms, so passionately twined Around his neck—with such a trusting fold, A full deep sense of safety in their hold, As if nought earthly might th' embrace unbind! Alas! a child's fond faith, believing still Its mother's breast beyond the lightning's reach to kill! LVIII Brief rest! upon the turning billow's height, A strange, sweet moment of some heavenly strain, Floating between the savage gusts of night, That sweep the seas to foam! Soon dark again The hour—the scene—th' intensely present, rush'd Back on her spirit, and her large tears gush'd Like blood-drops from a victim; with swift rain Bathing the bosom where she lean'd that hour, As if her life would melt into th' o'erswelling shower. LIX But he whose arm sustain'd her!—oh! I knew 'Twas vain,—and yet he hop'd!—he fondly strove Back from her faith her sinking soul to woo, As life might yet be hers!—A dream of love Which could not look upon so fair a thing, Remembering how like hope, like joy, like spring, Her smile was wont to glance, her step to move, And deem that men indeed, in very truth, Could mean the sting of death for her soft flowering youth! LX He woo'd her back to life.—“Sweet Inez, live! My blessed Inez!—visions have beguiled Thy heart; abjure them! thou wert form'd to give, And to find, joy; and hath not sunshine smiled Around thee ever? Leave me not, mine own! Or earth will grow too dark!—for thee alone, Thee have I loved, thou gentlest! from a child, And borne thine image with me o'er the sea, Thy soft voice in my soul—speak!—Oh! yet live for me!” LXI She look'd up wildly; there were anxious eyes Waiting that look—sad eyes of troubled thought, Alvar's—Theresa's!—Did her childhood rise, With all its pure and home-affections fraught, In the brief glance?—She clasp'd her hands—the strife Of love, faith, fear, and that vain dream of life, Within her woman's breast so deeply wrought, It seem'd as if a reed so slight and weak Must, in the rending storm not quiver only—break! LXII And thus it was—the young cheek flush'd and faded, As the swift blood in currents came and went, And hues of death the marble brow o'ershaded, And the sunk eye a wat'ry lustre sent Through its white fluttering lids. Then tremblings pass'd O'er the frail form that shook it, as the blast Shakes the sere leaf, until the spirit rent Its way to peace—the fearful way unknown— Pale in love's arms she lay—she!—what had loved was gone! LXIII Joy for thee, trembler!—thou redeem'd one, joy! Young dove set free!—earth, ashes, soulless clay, Remain'd for baffled vengeance to destroy; —Thy chain was riven!—nor hadst thou cast away Thy hope in thy last hour!—though love was there Striving to wring thy troubled soul from prayer, And life seem'd robed in beautiful array, Too fair to leave!—but this might be forgiven, Thou wert so richly crown'd with precious gifts of Heaven! LXIV But woe for him who felt the heart grow still, Which, with its weight of agony, had lain Breaking on his!—Scarce could the mortal chill Of the hush'd bosom, ne'er to heave again, And all the silence curdling round the eye, Bring home the stern belief that she could die— That she indeed could die!—for wild and vain As hope might be—his soul had hoped—'twas o'er— Slowly his failing arms dropp'd from the form they bore. LXV They forced him from that spot. It might be well, That the fierce, reckless words by anguish wrung From his torn breast, all aimless as they fell, Like spray-drops from the strife of torrents flung, Were mark'd as guilt.—There are, who note these things Against the smitten heart; its breaking strings —On whose low thrills once gentle music hung— With a rude hand of touch unholy trying, And numbering then as crimes, the deep, strange tones replying. LXVI But ye in solemn joy, O faithful pair! Stood gazing on your parted sister's dust; I saw your features by the torch's glare, And they were brightening with a heavenward trust! I saw the doubt, the anguish, the dismay, Melt from my Alvar's glorious mien away; And peace was there—the calmness of the just! And, bending down the slumb'rer's brow to kiss, “Thy rest is won,” he said; “sweet sister! praise for this!” LXVII I started as from sleep;—yes! he had spoken— A breeze had troubled memory's hidden source! At once the torpor of my soul was broken— Thought, feeling, passion, woke in tenfold force. —There are soft breathings in the southern wind, That so your ice-chains, O ye streams! unbind, And free the foaming swiftness of your course! —I burst from those that held me back, and fell Even on his neck, and cried—“Friend! brother! fare thee well!” LXVIII Did he not say, “Farewell?”—Alas! no breath Came to mine ear. Hoarse murmurs from the throng Told that the mysteries in the face of death Had from their eager sight been veil'd too long. And we were parted as the surge might part Those that would die together, true of heart.— His hour was come—but in mine anguish strong, Like a fierce swimmer through the midnight sea, Blindly I rush'd away from that which was to be. LXIX Away—away I rush'd—but swift and high The arrowy pillars of the firelight grew, Till the transparent darkness of the sky Flush'd to a blood-red mantle in their hue; And, phantom-like, the kindling city seem'd To spread, float, wave, as on the wind they stream'd, With their wild splendour chasing me!—I knew The death-work was begun—I veil'd mine eyes, Yet stopp'd in spell-bound fear to catch the victims' cries. LXX What heard I then?—a ringing shriek of pain, Such as for ever haunts the tortured ear?— I heard a sweet and solemn-breathing strain Piercing the flames, untremulous and clear!— The rich, triumphal tones!—I knew them well, As they came floating with a breezy swell! Man's voice was there—a clarion voice to cheer In the mid-battle—ay, to turn the flying— Woman's—that might have sung of heaven beside the dying! LXXI It was a fearful, yet a glorious thing, To hear that hymn of martyrdom, and know That its glad stream of melody could spring Up from the unsounded gulfs of human woe! Alvar! Theresa!—what is deep? what strong? —God's breath within the soul!—It fill'd that song From your victorious voices!—but the glow On the hot air and lurid skies increased— Faint grew the sounds—more faint—I listen'd—they had ceased! LXXII And thou indeed had'st perish'd, my soul's friend! I might form other ties—but thou alone Could'st with a glance the veil of dimness rend, By other years o'er boyhood's memory thrown! Others might aid me onward:—thou and I Had mingled the fresh thoughts that early die, Once flowering—never more!—And thou wert gone! Who could give back my youth, my spirit free, Or be in aught again what thou hadst been to me? LXXIII And yet I wept thee not, thou true and brave! I could not weep!—there gather'd round thy name Too deep a passion!—thou denied a grave! Thou, with the blight flung on thy soldier's fame! Had I not known thy heart from childhood's time? Thy heart of hearts?—and could'st thou die for crime?— No! had all earth decreed that death of shame, I would have set, against all earth's decree, Th' inalienable trust of my firm soul in thee! LXXIV There are swift hours in life—strong, rushing hours, That do the work of tempests in their might! They shake down things that stood as rocks and towers Unto th' undoubting mind;—they pour in light Where it but startles—like a burst of day For which the uprooting of an oak makes way;— They sweep the colouring mists from off our sight, They touch with fire thought's graven page, the roll Stamp'd with past years—and lo! it shrivels as a scroll! LXXV And this was of such hours!—the sudden flow Of my soul's tide seem'd whelming me; the glare Of the red flames, yet rocking to and fro, Scorch'd up my heart with breathless thirst for air, And solitude, and freedom. It had been Well with me then, in some vast desert scene, To pour my voice out, for the winds to bear On with them, wildly questioning the sky, Fiercely the untroubled stars, of man's dim destiny. LXXVI I would have call'd, adjuring the dark cloud; To the most ancient heavens I would have said— “Speak to me! show me truth!”—through night aloud I would have cried to him, the newly dead, “Come back! and show me truth!” My spirit seem'd Gasping for some free burst, its darkness teem'd With such pent storms of thought!—again I fled. I fled, a refuge from man's face to gain, Scarce conscious when I paused, entering a lonely fane. LXXVII A mighty minster, dim, and proud, and vast! Silence was round the sleepers whom its floor Shut in the grave; a shadow of the past, A memory of the sainted steps that wore, Erewhile, its gorgeous pavement, seem'd to brood Like mist upon the stately solitude; A halo of sad fame to mantle o'er Its white sepulchral forms of mail-clad men, And all was hush'd as night in some deep Alpine glen. LXXVIII More hush'd, far more!—for there the wind sweeps by, Or the woods tremble to the streams' loud play; Here a strange echo made my very sigh Seem for the place too much a sound of day! Too much my footsteps broke the moonlight, fading, Yet arch through arch in one soft flow pervading; And I stood still:—prayer, chant, had died away; Yet past me floated a funereal breath Of incense. I stood still—as before God and death. LXXIX For thick ye girt me round, ye long departed! Dust—imaged forms—with cross, and shield, and crest; It seem'd as if your ashes would have started, Had a wild voice burst forth above your rest! Yet ne'er, perchance, did worshipper of yore Bear to your thrilling presence what I bore Of wrath, doubt, anguish, battling in the breast! I could have pour'd out words, on that pale air, To make your proud tombs ring—no, no! I could not there! LXXX Not 'midst those aisles, through which a thousand years, Mutely as clouds and reverently, had swept; Not by those shrines, which yet the trace of tears And kneeling votaries on their marble kept! Ye were too mighty in your pomp of gloom And trophied age, O temple, altar, tomb! And you, ye dead!—for in that faith ye slept, Whose weight had grown a mountain's on my heart, Which could not there be loosed. I turn'd me to depart. LXXXI I turn'd—what glimmer'd faintly on my sight, Faintly, yet bright'ning as a wreath of snow Seen through dissolving haze?—The moon, the night, Had waned, and dawn pour'd in—grey, shadowy, slow, Yet dayspring still!—a solemn hue it caught, Piercing the storied windows, darkly fraught With stoles and draperies of imperial glow; And soft, and sad, that colouring gleam was thrown, Where, pale, a pictured form above the altar shone. LXXXII Thy form, thou Son of God!—a wrathful deep, With foam, and cloud, and tempest round Thee spread, And such a weight of night!—a night, when sleep From the fierce rocking of the billows fled. A bark show'd dim beyond Thee, with its mast Bow'd, and its rent sail shivering to the blast; But, like a spirit in thy gliding tread, Thou, as o'er glass, didst walk that stormy sea Through rushing winds, which left a silent path for Thee. LXXXIII So still thy white robes fell!—no breath of air Within their long and slumb'rous folds had sway. So still the waves of parted, shadowy hair From thy clear brow flow'd droopingly away! Dark were the heavens above thee, Saviour!—dark The gulfs, Deliverer! round the straining bark! But Thou!—o'er all thine aspect and array Was pour'd one stream of pale, broad, silvery light— Thou wert the single star of that all-shrouding night! LXXXIV Aid for one sinking!—Thy lone brightness gleam'd On his wild face, just lifted o'er the wave, With its worn, fearful, human look, that seem'd To cry, through surge and blast—“I perish—save!” Not to the winds—not vainly!—Thou wert nigh, Thy hand was stretch'd to fainting agony, Even in the portals of th' unquiet grave! O Thou that art the life! and yet didst bear Too much of mortal woe to turn from mortal prayer! LXXXV But was it not a thing to rise on death, With its remember'd light, that face of thine, Redeemer! dimm'd by this world's misty breath, Yet mournfully, mysteriously divine? O! that calm, sorrowful, prophetic eye, With its dark depths of grief, love, majesty! And the pale glory of the brow!—a shrine Where power sat veil'd, yet shedding softly round What told that Thou could'st be but for a time uncrown'd! LXXXVI And, more than all, the Heaven of that sad smile! The lip of mercy, our immortal trust! Did not that look, that very look, erewhile Pour its o'ershadow'd beauty on the dust? Wert thou not such when earth's dark cloud hung o'er Thee?— Surely thou wert!—my heart grew hush'd before Thee, Sinking, with all its passions, as the gust Sank at thy voice, along its billowy way— What had I there to do but kneel, and weep, and pray? LXXXVII Amidst the stillness rose my spirit's cry, Amidst the dead—“By that full cup of woe, Press'd from the fruitage of mortality, Saviour! for Thee—give light! that I may know If by thy will, in thine all-healing name, Men cast down human hearts to blighting shame, And early death—and say, if this be so, Where, then, is mercy? Whither shall we flee, So unallied to hope, save by our hold on Thee? LXXXVIII “But didst Thou not, the deep sea brightly treading, Lift from despair that struggler with the wave; And wert Thou not, sad tears, yet awful, shedding, Beheld a weeper at a mortal's grave? And is this weight of anguish, which they bind On life, this searing to the quick of mind, That but to God its own free path would crave, This crushing out of hope, and love, and youth, Thy will, indeed? Give light! that I may know the truth! LXXXIX “For my sick soul is darken'd unto death, With shadows from the suffering it hath seen; The strong foundations of mine ancient faith Sink from beneath me—whereon shall I lean? Oh! if from thy pure lips was wrung the sigh Of the dust's anguish! if like man to die, And earth round him shuts heavily—hath been Even to Thee bitter, aid me!—guide me!—turn My wild and wandering thoughts back from their starless bourne!” XC And calm'd I rose:—but how the while had risen Morn's orient sun, dissolving mist and shade! Could there indeed be wrong, or chain, or prison, In the bright world such radiance might pervade? It fill'd the fane, it mantled the pale form Which rose before me through the pictured storm, Even the grey tombs it kindled, and array'd With life!—how hard to see thy race begun, And think man wakes to grief, wakening to thee, O Sun! XCI I sought my home again:—and thou, my child, There at thy play beneath yon ancient pine, With eyes, whose lightning laughter hath beguiled A thousand pangs, thence flashing joy to mine; Thou in thy mother's arms, a babe, didst meet My coming with young smiles, which yet, though sweet, Seem'd on my soul all mournfully to shine, And ask a happier heritage for thee, Than but in turn the blight of human hope to see. XCII Now sport, for thou art free, the bright birds chasing Whose wings waft star-like gleams from tree to tree; Or with the fawn, thy swift wood-playmate, racing, Sport on, my joyous child! for thou art free! Yes, on that day I took thee to my heart, And inly vow'd, for thee a better part To choose; that so thy sunny bursts of glee Should wake no more dim thoughts of far-seen woe, But, gladdening fearless eyes, flow on—as now they flow. XCIII Thou hast a rich world round thee:—Mighty shades Weaving their gorgeous tracery o'er thy head, With the light melting through their high arcades, As through a pillar'd cloister's: but the dead Sleep not beneath; nor doth the sunbeam pass To marble shrines through rainbow-tinted glass; Yet thou, by fount and forest-murmur led To worship, thou art blest!—to thee is shown Earth in her holy pomp, deck'd for her God alone. PART SECOND. Wie diese treue liebe Seele Von ihrem Glauben voll, Der ganz allein Ihr selig machend ist, sich heilig quäle, Das sie den liebsten Mann verloren halten soll! Faust. I never shall smile more—but all my days Walk with still footsteps and with humble eyes, An everlasting hymn within my soul. Wilson. I Bring me the sounding of the torrent-water, With yet a nearer swell—fresh breeze, awake! And river, dark'ning ne'er with hues of slaughter Thy wave's pure silvery green,—and shining lake, Spread far before my cabin, with thy zone Of ancient woods, ye chainless things and lone! Send voices through the forest aisles, and make Glad music round me, that my soul may dare, Cheer'd by such tones, to look back on a dungeon's air! II Oh, Indian hunter of the desert's race! That with the spear at times, or bended bow, Dost cross my footsteps in thy fiery chase Of the swift elk or blue hill's flying roe; Thou that beside the red night-fire thou heapest, Beneath the cedars and the star-light sleepest, Thou know'st not, wanderer—never may'st thou know! Of the dark holds wherewith man cumbers earth, To shut from human eyes the dancing seasons' mirth. III There, fetter'd down from day, to think the while How bright in heaven the festal sun is glowing, Making earth's loneliest places, with his smile, Flush like the rose; and how the streams are flowing With sudden sparkles through the shadowy grass, And water-flowers, all trembling as they pass; And how the rich, dark summer-trees are bowing With their full foliage;—this to know, and pine Bound unto midnight's heart, seems a stern lot—'twas mine. IV Wherefore was this?—Because my soul had drawn Light from the book whose words are graved in light! There, at its well-head, had I found the dawn, And day, and noon of freedom:—but too bright It shines on that which man to man hath given, And call'd the truth—the verytruth, from heaven! And therefore seeks he, in his brother's sight, To cast the mote; and therefore strives to bind With his strong chains to earth, what is not earth's —the mind! V It is a weary and a bitter task Back from the lip the burning word to keep, And to shut out heaven's air with falsehood's mask, And in the dark urn of the soul to heap Indignant feelings—making e'en of thought A buried treasure, which may but be sought When shadows are abroad—and night—and sleep. I might not-brook it long—and thus was thrown Into that grave-like cell, to wither there alone. VI And I, a child of danger, whose delights Were on dark hills and many-sounding seas— I, that amidst the Cordillera heights Had given Castilian banners to the breeze, And the full circle of the rainbow seen There, on the snows; and in my country been A mountain wanderer, from the Pyrenees To the Morena crags—how left I not Life, or the soul's life, quench'd, on that sepulchral spot? VII Because Thou didst not leave me, O my God! Thou wert with those that bore the truth of old Into the deserts from the oppressor's rod, And made the caverns of the rock their fold; And in the hidden chambers of the dead, Our guiding lamp with fire immortal fed; And met when stars met, by their beams to hold The free heart's communing with Thee,—and Thou Wertin the midst, felt, own'd—the Strengthener then as now! VIII Yet once I sank. Alas! man's wavering mind! Wherefore and whence the gusts that o'er it blow? How they bear with them, floating uncombined, The shadows of the past, that come and go, As o'er the deep the old long-buried things, Which a storm's working to the surface brings! Is the reed shaken,—and must we be so, With every wind?—So, Father! must we be, Till we can fix undimm'd our steadfast eyes on Thee. IX Once my soul died within me. What had thrown That sickness o'er it?—Even a passing thought Of a clear spring, whose side, with flowers o'ergrown, Fondly and oft my boyish steps had sought! Perchance the damp roof's water-drops, that fell Just then, low tinkling through my vaulted cell, Intensely heard amidst the stillness, caught Some tone from memory, of the music, welling Ever with that fresh rill, from its deep rocky dwelling. X But so my spirit's fever'd longings wrought, Wakening, it might be, to the faint, sad sound, That from the darkness of the walls they brought A loved scene round me, visibly around. Yes! kindling, spreading, bright'ning, hue by hue, Like stars from midnight, through the gloom it grew, That haunt of youth, hope, manhood!—till the bound Of my shut cavern seem'd dissolved, and I Girt by the solemn hills and burning pomp of sky. XI I look'd—and lo! the clear, broad river flowing, Past the old Moorish ruin on the steep, The lone tower dark against a heaven all glowing, Like seas of glass and fire!—I saw the sweep Of glorious woods far down the mountain side, And their still shadows in the gleaming tide, And the red evening on its waves asleep; And 'midst the scene—oh! more than all—there smiled My child's fair face, and hers, the mother of my child! XII With their soft eyes of love and gladness raised Up to the flushing sky, as when we stood Last by that river, and in silence gazed On the rich world of sunset:—but a flood Of sudden tenderness my soul oppress'd, And I rush'd forward, with a yearning breast, To clasp—alas!—a vision!—Wave and wood, And gentle faces, lifted in the light Of day's last hectic blush, all melted from my sight. XIII Then darkness!—oh! th' unutterable gloom That seem'd as narrowing round me, making less And less my dungeon, when, with all its bloom, That bright dream vanish'd from my loneliness! It floated off, the beautiful!—yet left Such deep thirst in my soul, that thus bereft, I lay down, sick with passion's vain excess, And pray'd to die.—How oft would sorrow weep Her weariness to death, if he might come like sleep! XIV But I was roused—and how?—It is no tale Even midst thy shades, thou wilderness, to tell! I would not have my boy's young cheek made pale, Nor haunt his sunny rest with what befell In that drear prison-house. His eye must grow More dark with thought, more earnest his fair brow, More high his heart in youthful strength must swell; So shall it fitly burn when all is told:— Let childhood's radiant mist the free child yet enfold. XV It is enough that through such heavy hours, As wring us by our fellowship of clay, I lived, and undegraded. We have powers To snatch th' oppressor's bitter joy away! Shall the wild Indian, for his savage fame, Laugh and expire, and shall not Truth's high name Bear up her martyrs with all-conquering sway? It is enough that torture may be vain— I had seen Alvar die—the strife was won from Pain. XVI And faint not, heart of man! though years wane slow! There have been those that from the deepest caves, And cells of night, and fastnesses below The stormy dashing of the ocean-waves, Down, farther down than gold lies hid, have nursed A quenchless hope, and watch'd their time, and burst On the bright day, like wakeners from the graves! I was of such at last!—unchain'd I trode This green earth, taking back my freedom from my God! XVII That was an hour to send its fadeless trace Down life's far-sweeping tide!—A dim, wild night, Like sorrow, hung upon the soft moon's face, Yet how my heart leap'd in her blessed light! The shepherd's light—the sailor's on the sea— The hunter's homeward from the mountains free, Where its lone smile makes tremulously bright The thousand streams!—I could but gaze through tears— Oh! what a sight is heaven, thus first beheld for years! XVIII The rolling clouds!—they have the whole blue space Above to sail in—all the dome of sky! My soul shot with them in their breezy race O'er star and gloom!—but I had yet to fly, As flies the hunted wolf. A secret spot And strange, I knew—the sunbeam knew it not;— Wildest of all the savage glens that lie In far sierras, hiding their deep springs, And traversed but by storms, or sounding eagles' wings. XIX Ay, and I met the storm there!—I had gain'd The covert's heart with swift and stealthy tread: A moan went past me, and the dark trees rain'd Their autumn foliage rustling on my head; A moan—a hollow gust—and there I stood Girt with majestic night, and ancient wood, And foaming water.—Thither might have fled The mountain Christian with his faith of yore, When Afric's tambour shook the ringing western shore! XX But through the black ravine the storm came swelling, —Mighty thou are amidst the hills, thou blast! In thy lone course the kingly cedars felling, Like plumes upon the path of battle cast!— A rent oak thunder'd down beside my cave, Booming it rush'd, as booms a deep sea-wave; A falcon soar'd; a startled wild-deer pass'd; A far-off bell toll'd faintly through the roar:— How my glad spirit swept forth with the winds once more! XXI And with the arrowy lightnings!—for they flash'd, Smiting the branches in their fitful play, And brightly shivering where the torrents dash'd Up, even to crag and eagle's nest, their spray! And there to stand amidst the pealing strife, The strong pines groaning with tempestuous life, And all the mountain-voices on their way,— Was it not joy?—'twas joy in rushing might, After those years that wove but one long dead of night! XXII There came a softer hour, a lovelier moon, And lit me to my home of youth again, Through the dim chestnut shade, where oft at noon, By the fount's flashing burst, my head had lain In gentle sleep: but now I pass'd as one That may not pause where wood-streams whis-pering run, Or light sprays tremble to a bird's wild strain, Because th' avenger's voice is in the wind, The foe's quick, rustling step close on the leaves behind. XXIII My home of youth!—oh! if indeed to part With the soul's loved ones be a mournful thing, When we go forth in buoyancy of heart, And bearing all the glories of our spring For life to breathe on,—is it less to meet, When these are faded?—who shall call it sweet? —Even though love's mingling tears may haply bring Balm as they fall, too well their heavy showers Teach us how much is lost of all that once was ours! XXIV Not by the sunshine, with its golden glow, Nor the green earth, nor yet the laughing sky, Nor the fair flower scents, as they come and go In the soft air, like music wandering by; —Oh! not by these, th' unfailing, are we taught How time and sorrow on our frames have wrought; But by the sadden'd eye, the darken'd brow Of kindred aspect, and the long dim gaze, Which tells us we are changed—how changed from other days! XXV Before my father—in my place of birth, I stood an alien. On the very floor Which oft had trembled to my boyish mirth, The love that rear'd me, knew my face no more! There hung the antique armour, helm and crest, Whose every stain woke childhood in my breast; There droop'd the banner, with the marks it bore Of Paynim spears; and I, the worn in frame And heart, what there was I?—another and the same! XXVI Then bounded in a boy, with clear, dark eye— How should he know his father?—when we parted, From the soft cloud which mantles infancy, His soul, just wakening into wonder, darted Its first looks round. Him follow'd one, the bride Of my young days, the wife how loved and tried! Her glance met mine—I could not speak—she started With a bewilder'd gaze;—until there came Tears to my burning eyes, and from my lips her name. XXVII She knew me then!—I murmur'd “Leonor!” And her heart answer'd!—oh! the voice is known First from all else, and swiftest to restore Love's buried images, with one low tone That strikes like lightning, when the cheek is faded, And the brow heavily with thought o'ershaded, And all the brightness from the aspect gone! —Upon my breast she sunk, when doubt was fled, Weeping as those may weep, that meet in woe and dread. XXVIII For there we might not rest. Alas! to leave Those native towers, and know that they must fall By slow decay, and none remain to grieve When the weeds cluster'd on the lonely wall! We were the last—my boy and I—the last Of a long line which brightly thence had pass'd! My father bless'd me as I left his hall— With his deep tones and sweet, though full of years, He bless'd me there, and bathed my child's young head with tears. XXIX I had brought sorrow on his grey hairs down, And cast the darkness of my branded name (For so he deem'd it) on the clear renown, My own ancestral heritage of fame. And yet he bless'd me!—Father! if the dust Lie on those lips benign, my spirit's trust Is to behold thee yet, where grief and shame Dim the bright day no more; and thou will know That not through guilt thy son thus bow'd thine age with woe! XXX And thou, my Leonor! that unrepining, If sad in soul, didst quit all else for me, When stars—the stars that earliest rise—are shining, How their soft glance unseals each thought of thee! For on our flight they smiled; their dewy rays, Through the last olives, lit thy tearful gaze Back to the home we never more might see; So pass'd we on, like earth's first exiles, turning Fond looks where hung the sword above their Eden burning. XXXI It was a woe to say, “Farewell, my Spain! The sunny and the vintage land, farewell!” —I could have died upon the battle-plain For thee, my country! but I might not dwell In thy sweet vales, at peace.—The voice of song Breathes, with the myrtle scent, thy hills along; The citron's glow is caught from shade and dell; But what are these?—upon thy flowery sod I might not kneel, and pour my free thoughts out to God! XXXII O'er the blue deep I fled, the chainless deep!— Strange heart of man! that e'en 'midst woe swells high, When through the foam he sees his proud bark sweep, Flinging out joyous gleams to wave and sky! Yes! it swells high, whate'er he leaves behind, His spirit rises with the rising wind; For, wedded to the far futurity, On, on, it bears him ever, and the main Seems rushing, like his hope, some happier shore to gain. XXXIII Not thus is woman. Closely her still heart Doth twine itself with even each lifeless thing, Which, long remember'd, seem'd to bear its part In her calm joys. For ever would she cling, A brooding dove, to that sole spot of earth Where she hath loved, and given her children birth, And heard their first sweet voices. There may Spring Array no path, renew no flower, no leaf, But hath its breath of home, its claim to farewell grief. XXXIV I look'd on Leonor,—and if there seem'd A cloud of more than pensiveness to rise In the faint smiles that o'er her features gleam'd, And the soft darkness of her serious eyes, Misty with tender gloom, I call'd it nought But the fond exile's pang, a lingering thought Of her own vale, with all its melodies And living light of streams. Her soul would rest Beneath your shades, I said, bowers of the gorgeous west! XXXV Oh! could we live in visions! could we hold Delusion faster, longer, to our breast, When it shuts from us, with its mantle's fold, That which we see not, and are therefore blest! But they, our loved and loving—they to whom We have spread out our souls in joy and gloom, Their looks and accents, unto ours address'd, Have been a language of familiar tone Too long to breathe, at last, dark sayings and unknown. XXXVI I told my heart, 'twas but the exile's woe Which press'd on that sweet bosom;—I deceived My heart but half:—a whisper, faint and low, Haunting it ever, and at times believed, Spoke of some deeper cause. How oft we seem Like those that dream, and know the while they dream, 'Midst the soft falls of airy voices grieved, And troubled, while bright phantoms round them play, By a dim sense that all will float and fade away! XXXVII Yet, as if chasing joy, I woo'd the breeze To speed me onward with the wings of morn. —Oh! far amidst the solitary seas, Which were not made for man, what man hath borne, Answering their moan with his!—what thou didst bear, My lost and loveliest! while that secret care Grew terror, and thy gentle spirit, worn By its dull brooding weight, gave way at last, Beholding me as one from hope for ever cast! XXXVIII For unto thee, as through all change, reveal'd Mine inward being lay. In other eyes I had to bow me yet, and make a shield, To fence my burning bosom, of disguise; By the still hope sustain'd, erelong to win Some sanctuary, whose green retreats within, My thoughts unfetter'd to their source might rise, Like songs and scents of morn.—But thou didst look Through all my soul, and thine even unto fainting shook. XXXIX Fallen, fallen, I seem'd—yet, oh! not less beloved, Though from thy love was pluck'd the early pride, And harshly, by a gloomy faith reproved, And sear'd with shame!—though each young flower had died, There was the root,—strong, living, not the less That all it yielded now was bitterness; Yet still such love as quits not misery's side, Nor drops from guilt its ivy-like embrace, Nor turns away from death's its pale heroic face. XL Yes! thou hadst follow'd me through fear and flight! Thou would'st have follow'd had my path way led Even to the scaffold; had the flashing light Of the raised axe made strong men shrink with dread, Thou, 'midst the hush of thousands, would'st have been With thy clasp'd hands beside me kneeling seen, And meekly bowing to the shame thy head— The shame!—oh! making beautiful to view The might of human love—fair thing! so bravely true! XLI There was thine agony—to love so well Where fear made love life's chastener.—Heretofore Whate'er of earth's disquiet round thee fell, Thy soul, o'erpassing its dim bounds, could soar Away to sunshine, and thy clear eye speak Most of the skies when grief most touch'd thy cheek. Now, that far brightness faded, never more Could thou lift heavenwards for its hope thy heart, Since at heaven's gate it seem'd that thou and I must part. XLII Alas! and life hath moments when a glance— (If thought to sudden watchfulness be stirr'd)— A flush—a fading of the cheek, perchance— A word—less, less—the cadence of a word, Lets in our gaze the mind's dim veil beneath, Thence to bring haply knowledge fraught with death! —Even thus, what never from thy lip was heard Broke on my soul.—I knew that in thy sight I stood—howe'er beloved—a recreant from the light! XLIII Thy sad, sweet hymn, at eve, the seas along,— Oh! the deep soul it breathed!—the love, the woe, The fervour, pour'd in that full gush of song, As it went floating through the fiery glow Of the rich sunset!—bringing thoughts of Spain, With all her vesper-voices, o'er the main, Which seem'd responsive in its murmuring flow. —“Ave sanctissima!”—how oft that lay Hath melted from my heart the martyr-strength away! Ave, sanctissima! 'Tis nightfall on the sea; Ora pro nobis! Our souls rise to thee! Watch us, while shadows lie O'er the dim waters spread; Hear the heart's lonely sigh— Thine too hath bled! Thou that hast look'd on death, Aid us when death is near! Whisper of heaven to faith; Sweet Mother, hear! Ora pro nobis! The wave must rock our sleep, Ora, Mater, ora! Thou star of the deep! XLIV “Ora pro nobis, Mater!”—What a spell Was in those notes, with day's last glory dying On the flush'd waters—seem'd they not to swell From the far dust, wherein my sires were lying With crucifix and sword?—Oh! yet how clear Comes their reproachful sweetness to mine ear! “Ora”—with all the purple waves replying, All my youth's visions rising in the strain— And I had thought it much to bear the rack and chain! XLV Torture! the sorrow of affection's eye, Fixing its meekness on the spirit's core, Deeper, and teaching more of agony, May pierce than many swords!—and this I bore With a mute pang. Since I had vainly striven From its free springs to pour the truth of Heaven Into thy trembling soul, my Leonor! Silence rose up where hearts no hope could share:— Alas! for those that love, and may not blend in prayer! XLVI We could not pray together 'midst the deep, Which, like a floor of sapphire, round us lay, Through days of splendour, nights too bright for sleep, Soft, solemn, holy!—We were on our way Unto the mighty Cordillera-land, With men whom tales of that world's golden strand Had lured to leave their vines.—Oh! who shall say What thoughts rose in us, when the tropic sky Touch'd all its molten seas with sunset's alchemy! XLVII Thoughts no more mingled!—Then came night—th' intense Dark blue—the burning stars!—I saw thee shine Once more, in thy serene magnificence, O Southern Cross! as when thy radiant sign First drew my gaze of youth.—No, not as then; I had been stricken by the darts of men Since those fresh days; and now thy light divine Look'd on mine anguish, while within me strove The still small voice against the might of suffering love. XLVIII But thou, the clear, the glorious! thou wert pouring Brilliance and joy upon the crystal wave, While she that met thy ray with eyes adoring, Stood in the lengthening shadow of the grave! —Alas! I watch'd her dark religious glance, As it still sought thee through the heaven's expanse, Bright Cross! and knew not that I watch'd what gave But passing lustre—shrouded soon to be— A soft light found no more—no more on earth or sea! XLIX I knew not all—yet something of unrest Sat on my heart. Wake, ocean-wind! I said; Waft us to land, in leafy freshness drest, Where, through rich clouds of foliage o'er her head, Sweet day may steal, and rills unseen go by, Like singing voices, and the green earth lie Starry with flowers, beneath her graceful tread! —But the calm bound us 'midst the glassy main; Ne'er was her step to bend earth's living flowers again. L Yes! as if Heaven upon the waves were sleeping, Vexing my soul with quiet, there they lay, All moveless, through their blue transparence keeping The shadows of our sails, from day to day; While she—oh! strongest is the strong heart's woe— And yet I live! I feel the sunshine's glow— And I am he that look'd, and saw decay Steal o'er the fair of earth, th' adored too much!— It is a fearful thing to love what death may touch. LI A fearful thing that love and death may dwell In the same world!—She faded on—and I, Blind to the last, there needed death to tell My trusting soul that she could fade to die! Yet, ere she parted, I had mark'd a change, But it breathed hope—'twas beautiful, though strange: Something of gladness in the melody Of her low voice, and in her words a flight Of airy thought—alas! too perilously bright! LII And a clear sparkle in her glance, yet wild, And quick, and eager, like the flashing gaze Of some all-wondering and awakening child, That first the glories of the earth surveys. How could it thus deceive me?—she had worn Around her, like the dewy mists of morn, A pensive tenderness through happiest days; And a soft world of dreams had seem'd to lie Still in her dark, and deep, and spiritual eye. LIII And I could hope in that strange fire!—she died, She died, with all its lustre on her mien!— The day was melting from the waters wide, And through its long bright hours her thoughts had been, It seem'd, with restless and unwonted yearning, To Spain's blue skies and dark sierras turning; For her fond words were all of vintage-scene, And flowering myrtle, and sweet citron's breath: Oh! with what vivid hues life comes back oft on death! LIV And from her lips the mountain-songs of old, In wild, faint snatches, fitfully had sprung; Songs of the orange bower, the Moorish hold, The “Rio verde,” on her soul that hung, And thence flow'd forth.—But now the sun was low; And watching by my side its last red glow, That ever stills the heart, once more she sung Her own soft “Ora, Mater!”—and the sound Was even like love's farewell—so mournfully profound. LV The boy had dropp'd to slumber at our feet; “And I have lull'd him to his smiling rest Once more!” she said:—I raised him—it was sweet, Yet sad, to see the perfect calm which bless'd His look that hour:—for now her voice grew weak; And on the flowery crimson of his cheek, With her white lips, a long, long kiss she press'd, Yet light, to wake him not.—Then sank her head Against my bursting heart:—What did I clasp?—the dead! LVI I call'd—to call what answers not our cries, By what we loved to stand unseen, unheard, With the loud passion of our tears and sighs, To see but some cold glittering ringlet stirr'd And in the quench'd eye's fixedness to gaze, All vainly searching for the parted rays; This is what waits us!—Dead!—with that chill word To link our bosom-names!—For this we pour Our souls upon the dust—nor tremble to adore! LVII But the true parting came!—I look'd my last On the sad beauty of that slumbering face; How could I think the lovely spirit pass'd, Which there had left so tenderly its trace? Yet a dim awfulness was on the brow— No! not like sleep to look upon art Thou, Death, Death!—She lay, a thing for earth's embrace, To cover with spring-wreaths. For earth's?—the wave That gives the bier no flowers—makes moan above her grave! LVIII On the mid-seas a knell!—for man was there, Anguish and love—the mourner with his dead! A long, low-rolling knell—a voice of prayer— Dark glassy waters, like a desert spread,— And the pale-shining Southern Cross on high, Its faint stars fading from a solemn sky, Where mighty clouds before the dawn grew red:— Were these things round me? Such o'er memory sweep Wildly, when aught brings back that burial of the deep. LIX Then the broad, lonely sunrise!—and the plash Into the sounding waves!—around her head They parted, with a glancing moment's flash, Then shut—and all was still. And now thy bed Is of their secrets, gentlest Leonor! Once fairest of young brides!—and never more, Loved as thou wert, may human tear be shed Above thy rest!—No mark the proud seas keep, To show where he that wept may pause again to weep! LX So the depths took thee!—Oh! the sullen sense Of desolation in that hour compress'd! Dust going down, a speck, amidst th' immense And gloomy waters, leaving on their breast The trace a weed might leave there!—Dust!—the thing Which to the heart was as a living spring Of joy, with fearfulness of love possess'd, Thus sinking!—Love, joy, fear, all crush'd to this— And the wide heaven so far—so fathomless th' abyss! LXI Where the line sounds not, where the wrecks lie low, What shall wake thence the dead?—Blest, blest are they That earth to earth intrust; for they may know And tend the dwelling whence the slumberer's clay Shall rise at last; and bid the young flowers bloom, That waft a breath of hope around the tomb; And kneel upon the dewy turf to pray! But thou, what cave hath dimly chamber'd thee? Vain dreams!—oh! art thou not where there is no more sea? LXII The wind rose free and singing:—when for ever, O'er that sole spot of all the watery plain, I could have bent my sight with fond endeavour Down, where its treasure was, its glance to strain; Then rose the reckless wind! Before our prow The white foam flash'd—ay, joyously, and thou Wert left with all the solitary main Around thee—and thy beauty in my heart, And thy meek, sorrowing love—oh! where could that depart? LXIII I will not speak of woe; I may not tell— Friend tells not such to friends—the thoughts which rent My fainting spirit, when its wild farewell Across the billows to thy grave was sent, Thou, there most lonely!—He that sits above, In his calm glory, will forgive the love His creatures bear each other, even if blent With a vain worship; for its close is dim Ever with grief which leads the wrung soul back to Him! LXIV And with a milder pang if now I bear To think of thee in thy forsaken rest, If from my heart be lifted the despair, The sharp remorse with healing influence press'd, If the soft eyes that visit me in sleep Look not reproach, though still they seem to weep; It is that He my sacrifice hath bless'd, And fill'd my bosom, through its inmost cell, With a deep chastening sense that all at last is well. LXV Yes! thou art now—Oh! wherefore doth the thought Of the wave dashing o'er thy long bright hair, The sea-weed into its dark tresses wrought, The sand thy pillow—thou that wert so fair! Come o'er me still!—Earth, earth!—it is the hold Earth ever keeps on that of earthly mould! But thou art breathing now in purer air, I well believe, and freed from all of error, Which blighted here the root of thy sweet life with terror. LXVI And if the love, which here was passing light, Went with what died not—Oh! that this we knew, But this!—that through the silence of the night, Some voice, of all the lost ones and the true, Would speak, and say, if in their far repose, We are yet aught of what we were to those We call the dead!—their passionate adieu, Was it but breath, to perish?—Holier trust Be mine!—thy love is there, but purified from dust! LXVII A thing all heavenly!—clear'd from that which hung As a dim cloud between us, heart and mind! Loosed from the fear, the grief, whose tendrils flung A chain, so darkly with its growth entwined. This is my hope!—though when the sunset fades, When forests rock the midnight on their shades, When tones of wail are in the rising wind, Across my spirit some faint doubt may sigh; For the strong hours will sway this frail mortality! LXVIII We have been wand'rers since those days of woe, Thy boy and I!—As wild birds tend their young, So have I tended him—my bounding roe! The high Peruvian solitudes among; And o'er the Andes' torrents borne his form, Where our frail bridge hath quiver'd 'midst the storm. But there the war-notes of my country rung, And, smitten deep of Heaven and man, I fled To hide in shades unpierced a mark'd and weary head. LXIX But he went on in gladness—that fair child! Save when at times his bright eye seem'd to dream, And his young lips, which then no longer smiled, Ask'd of his mother!—That was but a gleam Of memory, fleeting fast; and then his play Through the wide Llanos cheer'd again our way, And by the mighty Oronoco stream, On whose lone margin we have heard at morn, From the mysterious rocks, the sunrise-music borne. LXX So like a spirit's voice! a harping tone, Lovely, yet ominous to mortal ear, Such as might reach us from a world unknown, Troubling man's heart with thrills of joy and fear! 'Twas sweet!—yet those deep southern shades oppress'd My soul with stillness, like the calms that rest On melancholy waves: I sigh'd to hear Once more earth's breezy sounds, her foliage fann'd, And turn'd to seek the wilds of the red hunter's land. LXXI And we have won a bower of refuge now, In this fresh waste, the breath of whose repose Hath cool'd, like dew, the fever of my brow, And whose green oaks and cedars round me close As temple-walls and pillars, that exclude Earth's haunted dreams from their free solitude; All, save the image and the thought of those Before us gone; our loved of early years, Gone where affection's cup hath lost the taste of tears. LXXII I see a star—eve's first-born!—in whose train Past scenes, words, looks, come back. The arrowy spire Of the lone cypress, as of wood-girt fane, Rests dark and still amidst a heaven of fire; The pine gives forth its odours, and the lake Gleams like one ruby, and the soft winds wake, Till every string of nature's solemn lyre Is touch'd to answer; its most secret tone Drawn from each tree, for each hath whispers all its own. LXXIII And hark! another murmur on the air, Not of the hidden rills, or quivering shades!— That is the cataract's, which the breezes bear, Filling the leafy twilight of the glades With hollow surge-like sounds, as from the bed Of the blue, mournful seas, that keep the dead: But they are far!—the low sun here pervades Dim forest-arches, bathing with red gold Their stems, till each is made a marvel to behold,— LXXIV Gorgeous, yet full of gloom!—In such an hour, The vesper-melody of dying bells Wanders through Spain, from each grey convent's tower O'er shining rivers pour'd, and olive-dells, By every peasant heard, and muleteer, And hamlet, round my home:—and I am here, Living again through all my life's farewells, In these vast woods, where farewell ne'er was spoken, And sole I lift to Heaven a sad heart—yet unbroken! LXXV In such an hour are told the hermit's beads; With the white sail the seaman's hymn floats by: Peace be with all! whate'er their varying creeds, With all that send up holy thoughts on high! Come to me, boy!—by Guadalquiver's vines, By every stream of Spain, as day declines, Man's prayers are mingled in the rosy sky. —We, too, will pray; nor yet unheard, my child! Of Him whose voice we hear at eve amidst the wild. LXXVI At eve?—O through all hours!—From dark dreams oft Awakening, I look forth, and learn the might Of solitude, while thou art breathing soft, And low, my loved one! on the breast of night: I look forth on the stars—the shadowy sleep Of forests—and the lake whose gloomy deep Sends up red sparkles to the fire-flies' light. A lonely world!—even fearful to man's thought But for His presence felt, whom here my soul hath sought. LAYS OF MANY LANDS. The following pieces may so far be considered a series, as each is intended to be commemorative of some national recollection, popular custom, or tradition. The idea was suggested by Herder's “Stimmen der Völker in Liedern;” the execution is, however, different, as the poems in his collection are chiefly translations. MOORISH BRIDAL SONG. The citron-groves their fruit and flowers were strewing Around a Moorish palace, while the sigh Of low sweet summer-winds, the branches wooing With music through their shadowy bowers went by; Music and voices, from the marble halls, Through the leaves gleaming, and the fountain-falls. A song of joy, a bridal-song came swelling, To blend with fragrance in those southern shades, And told of feasts within the stately dwelling, Bright lamps, and dancing steps, and gem-crown'd maids: And thus it flow'd;—yet something in the lay Belong'd to sadness, as it died away. “The bride comes forth! her tears no more are falling To leave the chamber of her infant years; Kind voices from a distant home are calling; She comes like day-spring—she hath done with tears; Now must her dark eye shine on other flowers, Her soft smile gladden other hearts than ours!— Pour the rich odours round! “We haste! the chosen and the lovely bringing; Love still goes with her from her place of birth; Deep, silent joy within her soul is springing, Though in her glance the light no more is mirth! Her beauty leaves us in its rosy years; Her sisters weep—but she hath done with tears!— Now may the timbrel sound!” Know'st thou for whom they sang the bridal numbers?— One, whose rich tresses were to wave no more! One, whose pale cheek soft winds, nor gentle slumbers, Nor Love's own sigh, to rose-tints might restore! Her graceful ringlets o'er a bier were spread.— Weep for the young, the beautiful,—the dead! THE BIRD'S RELEASE. Go forth, for she is gone! With the golden light of her wavy hair, She is gone to the fields of the viewless air; She hath left her dwelling lone! Her voice hath pass'd away! It hath pass'd away like a summer breeze, When it leaves the hills for the far blue seas, Where we may not trace its way. Go forth, and like her be free! With thy radiant wing, and thy glancing eye, Thou hast all the range of the sunny sky, And what is our grief to thee? Is it aught even to her we mourn? Doth she look on the tears by her kindred shed? Doth she rest with the flowers o'er her gentle head, Or float, on the light wind borne? We know not—but she is gone! Her step from the dance, her voice from the song, And the smile of her eye from the festal throng;— She hath left her dwelling lone! When the waves at sunset shine, We may hear thy voice amidst thousands more, In the scented woods of our glowing shore; But we shall not know 'tis thine! Even so with the loved one flown! Her smile in the starlight may wander by, Her breath may be near in the wind's low sigh, Around us—but all unknown. Go forth, we have loosed thy chain! We may deck thy cage with the richest flowers Which the bright day rears in our eastern bowers; But thou will not be lured again. Even thus may the summer pour All fragrant things on the land's green breast, And the glorious earth like a bride be dress'd, But it wins her back no more! THE SWORD OF THE TOMB. A NORTHERN LEGEND. “Voice of the gifted elder time! Voice of the charm and the Runic rhyme! Speak! from the shades and the depths disclose How Sigurd may vanquish his mortal foes; Voice of the buried past! “Voice of the grave! 'tis the mighty hour, When night with her stars and dreams hath power, And my step hath been soundless on the snows, And the spell I have sung hath laid repose On the billow and the blast.” Then the torrents of the North, And the forest pines were still, While a hollow chant came forth From the dark sepulchral hill. “There shines no sun 'midst the hidden dead; But where the day looks not the brave may tread: There is heard no song, and no mead is pour'd; But the warrior may come to the silent board, In the shadow of the night. “There is laid a sword in thy father's tomb, And its edge is fraught with thy foeman's doom; But soft be thy step through the silence deep, And move not the urn in the house of sleep, For the viewless have fearful might!” Then died the solemn lay, As a trumpet's music dies, By the night-wind borne away Through the wild and stormy skies. The fir-trees rock'd to the wailing blast, As on through the forest the warrior pass'd— Through the forest of Odin, the dim and old— The dark place of visions and legends, told By the fires of Northern pine. The fir-trees rock'd, and the frozen ground Gave back to his footstep a hollow sound; And it seem'd that the depths of those awful shades, From the dreary gloom of their long arcades, Gave warning, with voice and sign. But the wind strange magic knows, To call wild shape and tone From the grey wood's tossing boughs, When Night is on her throne. The pines closed o'er him with deeper gloom, As he took the path to the monarch's tomb: The Pole-star shone, and the heavens were bright With the arrowy streams of the Northern light; But his road through dimness lay! He pass'd, in the heart of that ancient wood, The dark shrine stain'd with the victim's blood; Nor paused till the rock, where a vaulted bed Had been hewn of old for the kingly dead, Arose on his midnight way. Then first a moment's chill Went shuddering through his breast, And the steel-clad man stood still Before that place of rest. But he cross'd at length, with a deep-drawn breath, The threshold-floor of the hall of Death, And look'd on the pale mysterious fire Which gleam'd from the urn of his warrior-sire With a strange and solemn light. Then darkly the words of the boding strain Like an omen rose on his soul again, —“Soft be thy step through the silence deep, And move not the urn in the house of sleep, For the viewless have fearful might!” But the gleaming sword and shield Of many a battle-day Hung o'er that urn, reveal'd By the tomb-fire's waveless ray; With a faded wreath of oak-leaves bound, They hung o'er the dust of the far-renown'd, Whom the bright Valkyriur's warning voice Had call'd to the banquet where gods rejoice, And the rich mead flows in light. With a beating heart his son drew near, And still rang the verse in his thrilling ear, —“Soft be thy step through the silence deep, And move not the urn in the house of sleep, For the viewless have fearful might!” And many a Saga's rhyme, And legend of the grave, That shadowy scene and time Call'd back, to daunt the brave. But he raised his arm—and the flame grew dim, And the sword in its light seem'd to wave and swim, And his faltering hand could not grasp it well— From the pale oak-wreath, with a clash it fell Through the chamber of the dead! The deep tomb rang with the heavy sound, And the urn lay shiver'd in fragments round; And a rush, as of tempests, quench'd the fire, And the scatter'd dust of his warlike sire Was strewn on the Champion's head. One moment—and all was still In the slumberer's ancient hall, When the rock had ceas'd to thrill With the mighty weapon's fall. The stars were just fading, one by one, The clouds were just tinged by the early sun, When there stream'd through the cavern a torch's flame, And the brother of Sigurd the valiant came To seek him in the tomb. Stretch'd on his shield, like the steel-girt slain, By moonlight seen on the battle-plain, In a speechless trance lay the warrior there; But he wildly woke when the torch's glare Burst on him through the gloom. “The morning wind blows free, And the hour of chase is near: Come forth, come forth with me! What do'st thou, Sigurd, here?” “I have put out the holy sepulchral fire, I have scatter'd the dust of my warrior-sire! It burns on my head, and it weighs down my heart; But the winds shall not wander without their part To strew o'er the restless deep! “In the mantle of death he was here with me now— There was wrath in his eye, there was gloom on his brow; And his cold still glance on my spirit fell With an icy ray and a withering spell— Oh! chill is the house of sleep!” “The morning wind blows free, And the reddening sun shines clear; Come forth, come forth with me! It is dark and fearful here!” “He is there, he is there, with his shadowy frown! But gone from his head is the kingly crown— The crown from his head, and the spear from his hand— They have chased him far from the glorious land Where the feast of the gods is spread! “He must go forth alone on his phantom steed, He must ride o'er the grave-hills with stormy speed: His place is no longer at Odin's board, He is driven from Valhalla without his sword; But the slayer shall avenge the dead!” That sword its fame had won By the fall of many a crest; But its fiercest work was done In the tomb, on Sigurd's breast. VALKYRIUR SONG. “Tremblingly flash'd th' inconstant meteor light, Showing thin forms like virgins of this earth; Save that all signs of human joy or grief, The flush of passion, smile, or tear, had seem'd On the fix'd brightness of each dazzling cheek Strange and unnatural.” Milman. The sea-king woke from the troubled sleep Of a vision-haunted night, And he look'd from his bark o'er the gloomy deep, And counted the streaks of light; For the red sun's earliest ray Was to rouse his bands that day To the stormy joy of fight! But the dreams of rest were still on earth, And the silent stars on high, And there waved not the smoke of one cabin hearth 'Midst the quiet of the sky; And along the twilight bay, In their sleep the hamlets lay, For they knew not the Norse were nigh! The Sea-king look'd o'er the brooding wave: He turn'd to the dusky shore, And there seem'd, through the arch of a tide-worn cave, A gleam, as of snow, to pour; And forth, in watery light, Moved phantoms, dimly white, Which the garb of woman bore. Slowly they moved to the billow side; And the forms, as they grew more clear, Seem'd each on a tall pale steed to ride, And a shadowy crest to rear, And to beckon with faint hand From the dark and rocky strand, And to point a gleaming spear. Then a stillness on his spirit fell, Before th' unearthly train, For he knew Valhalla's daughters well, The Choosers of the slain! And a sudden rising breeze Bore, across the moaning seas, To his ear their thrilling strain. “There are songs in Odin's Hall For the brave ere night to fall! Doth the great sun hide his ray?— He must bring a wrathful day! Sleeps the falchion in its sheath?— Swords must do the work of death! Regner!—Sea-king!—thee we call!— There is joy in Odin's Hall. “At the feast and in the song, Thou shalt be remember'd long! By the green isles of the flood, Thou hast left thy track in blood! On the earth and on the sea, There are those will speak of thee! 'Tis enough,—the war-gods call,— There is mead in Odin's Hall! “Regner! tell thy fair-hair'd bride She must slumber at thy side! Tell the brother of thy breast Even for him thy grave hath rest! Tell the raven steed which bore thee, When the wild wolf fled before thee, He too with his lord must fall,— There is room in Odin's Hall! “Lo! the mighty sun looks forth— Arm! thou leader of the north! Lo! the mists of twilight fly,— We must vanish, thou must die! By the sword and by the spear, By the hand that knows not fear, Sea-king! nobly shalt thou fall!— There is joy in Odin's Hall!” There was arming heard on land and wave, When afar the sunlight spread, And the phantom forms of the tide-worn cave With the mists of morning fled; But at eve, the kingly hand Of the battle-axe and brand Lay cold on a pile of dead! THE CAVERN OF THE THREE TELLS. A SWISS TRADITION. Oh! enter not yon shadowy cave, Seek not the bright spars there, Though the whispering pines that o'er it wave With freshness fill the air: For there the Patriot Three, In the garb of old array'd, By their native Forest-sea, On a rocky couch are laid. The Patriot Three that met of yore Beneath the midnight sky, And leagued their hearts on the Grütli shore In the name of liberty! Now silently they sleep Amidst the hills they freed; But their rest is only deep Till their country's hour of need. They start not at the hunter's call, Nor the Lammer-geyer's cry, Nor the rush of a sudden torrent's fall, Nor the Lauwine thundering by! And the Alpine herdsman's lay, To a Switzer's heart so dear! On the wild wind floats away, No more for them to hear. But when the battle-horn is blown Till the Schreckhorn's peaks reply, When the Jungfrau's cliffs send back the tone Through their eagles' lonely sky; When the spear-heads light the lakes, When trumpets loose the snows, When the rushing war-steed shakes The glacier's mute repose; When Uri's beechen woods wave red In the burning hamlet's light;— Then from the cavern of the dead Shall the sleepers wake in might! With a leap, like Tell's proud leap When away the helm he flung, And boldly up the steep From the flashing billow sprung! The point of rock on which Tell leaped from the boat of Gessler is marked by a chapel, and called the Tellensprung. They shall wake beside their Forest-sea, In the ancient garb they wore When they link'd the hands that made us free, On the Grütli's moonlight shore; And their voices shall be heard, And be answer'd with a shout, Till the echoing Alps are stirr'd, And the signal-fires blaze out. And the land shall see such deeds again As those of that proud day, When Winkelried, on Sempach's plain, Through the serried spears made way; And when the rocks came down On the dark Morgarten dell, And the crowned casques, Crowned Helmets, as a distinction of rank, are mentioned in Simond's Switzerland. o'erthrown, Before our fathers fell! For the Kühreihen's The Kühreihen—the celebrated Ranz des Vaches.notes must never sound In a land that wears the chain, And the vines on freedom's holy ground Untrampled must remain! And the yellow harvests wave For no stranger's hand to reap, While within their silent cave The men of Grütli sleep! SWISS SONG, ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF AN ANCIENT BATTLE. Look on the white Alps round! If yet they gird a land Where Freedom's voice and step are found, Forget ye not the band,— The faithful band, our sires, who fell Here in the narrow battle dell! If yet, the wilds among, Our silent hearts may burn, When the deep mountain-horn hath rung, And home our steps may turn,— Home!—home!—if still that name be dear, Praise to the men who perish'd here! Look on the white Alps round! Up to their shining snows That day the stormy rolling sound, The sound of battle, rose! Their caves prolong'd the trumpet's blast, Their dark pines trembled as it pass'd! They saw the princely crest, They saw the knightly spear, The banner and the mail-clad breast, Borne down, and trampled here! They saw—and glorying there they stand, Eternal records to the land! Praise to the mountain-born, The brethren of the glen! By them no steel array was worn, They stood as peasant-men! They left the vineyard and the field, To break an empire's lance and shield! Look on the white Alps round! If yet, along their steeps, Our children's fearless feet may bound, Free as the chamois leaps: Teach them in song to bless the band Amidst whose mossy graves we stand! If, by the wood-fire's blaze, When winter stars gleam cold, The glorious tales of elder days May proudly yet be told, Forget not then the shepherd race, Who made the hearth a holy place! Look on the white Alps round! If yet the Sabbath-bell Comes o'er them with a gladdening sound. Think on the battle dell! For blood first bathed its flowery sod, That chainless hearts might worship God! THE MESSENGER BIRD. Thou art come from the spirits' land, thou bird! Thou art come from the spirit's land: Through the dark pine grove let thy voice be heard, And tell of the shadowy band! We know that the bowers are green and fair In the light of that summer shore, And we know that the friends we have lost are there, They are there—and they weep no more! And we know they have quenched their fever's thirst From the Fountain of youth ere now, For there must the stream in its freshness burst Which none may find below! And we know that they will not be lured to earth From the land of deathless flowers, By the feast, or the dance, or the song of mirth, Though their hearts were once with ours: Though they sat with us by the night-fire's blaze, And bent with us the bow, And heard the tales of our fathers' days, Which are told to others now! But tell us, thou bird of the solemn strain! Can those who have loved forget? We call—and they answer not again— Do they love—do they love us yet? Doth the warrior think of his brother there, And the father of his child? And the chief, of those that were wont to share His wandering through the wild? We call them far through the silent night, And they speak not from cave or hill; We know, thou bird! that their land is bright, But say, do they love there still? The attribution of this poem is questionable. ANSWER TO THE MESSENGER BIRD. Of doubtful attribution. BY AN AMERICAN QUAKER LADY. Yes, I came from the spirits' land, From the land that is bright and fair; I came with a voice from the shadowy band, To tell that they love you there. To say, if a wish or a vain regret Could live in Elysian bowers, 'Twould be for the friends they can ne'er forget, The beloved of their youthful hours. To whisper the dear deserted band, Who smiled on their tarriance here, That a faithful guard in the dreamless land, Are the friends they have loved so dear. 'Tis true, in the silent night you call, And they answer you not again; But the spirits of bliss are voiceless all— Sound only was made for pain. That their land is bright and they weep no more, I have warbled from hill to hill; But my plaintive strain should have told before, That they love, oh! they love you still. They bid me say that unfading flowers You'll find in the path they trode; And a welcome true to their deathless bowers, Pronounced by the voice of God. 1827. THE STRANGER IN LOUISIANA. We saw thee, O stranger, and wept! We look'd for the youth of the sunny glance Whose step was the fleetest in chase or dance! The light of his eye was a joy to see, The path of his arrows a storm to flee! But there came a voice from a distant shore: He was call'd—he is found 'midst his tribe no more! He is not in his place when the night-fires burn, But we look for him still—he will yet return! His brother sat with a drooping brow In the gloom of the shadowing cypress bough: We roused him—we bade him no longer pine, For we heard a step—but the step was thine. We saw thee, O stranger, and wept! We look'd for the maid of the mournful song— Mournful, though sweet—she hath left us long! We told her the youth of her love was gone, And she went forth to seek him—she pass'd alone; We hear not her voice when the woods are still, From the bower where it sang, like a silvery rill. The joy of her sire with her smile is fled, The winter is white on his lonely head, He hath none by his side when the wilds we track, He hath none when we rest—yet she comes not back! We look'd for her eye on the feast to shine, For her breezy step—but the step was shine! We saw thee, O stranger, and wept! We look'd for the chief who hath left the spear And the bow of his battles forgotten here! We look'd for the hunter, whose bride's lament On the wind of the forest at eve is sent: We look'd for the first-born, whose mother's cry Sounds wild and shrill through the midnight sky!— Where are they?—thou'rt seeking some distant coast— O ask of them, stranger!—send back the lost! Tell them we mourn by the dark blue streams, Tell them our lives but of them are dreams! Tell, how we sat in the gloom to pine, And to watch for a step—but the step was thine! THE ISLE OF FOUNTS. AN INDIAN TRADITION. Son of the stranger! wouldst thou take O'er yon blue hills thy lonely way, To reach the still and shining lake Along whose banks the west winds play?— Let no vain dreams thy heart beguile, Oh! seek thou not the Fountain Isle! Lull but the mighty serpent king, 'Midst the grey rocks, his old domain; Ward but the cougar's deadly spring,— Thy step that lake's green shore may gain; And the bright Isle, when all is pass'd, Shall vainly meet thine eye at last! Yes! there, with all its rainbow streams, Clear as within thine arrow's flight, The Isle of Founts, the Isle of dreams, Floats on the wave in golden light; And lovely will the shadows be Of groves whose fruit is not for thee! And breathings from their sunny flowers, Which are not of the things that die, And singing voices from their bowers, Shall greet thee in the purple sky; Soft voices, e'en like those that dwell Far in the green reed's hollow cell. Or hast thou heard the sounds that rise From the deep chambers of the earth? The wild and wondrous melodies To which the ancient rocks gave birth? The stones on the banks of the Oronoco, called by the South American missionaries Laxas de Musica, and alluded to in a former note. Like that sweet song of hidden caves Shall swell those wood-notes o'er the waves. The emerald waves!—they take their hue And image from that sunbright shore; But wouldst thou launch thy light canoe, And wouldst thou ply thy rapid oar,— Before thee, hadst thou morning's speed, The dreamy land should still recede! Yet on the breeze thou still wouldst hear The music of its flowering shades, And ever should the sound be near Of founts that ripple through its glades; The sound, and sight, and flashing ray Of joyous waters in their play! But woe for him who sees them burst With their bright spray-showers to the lake! Earth has no spring to quench the thirst That semblance in his soul shall wake, For ever pouring through his dreams, The gush of those untasted streams! Bright, bright in many a rocky urn, The waters of our deserts lie, Yet at their source his lip shall burn, Parch'd with the fever's agony! From the blue mountains to the main, Our thousand floods may roll in vain. E'en thus our hunters came of yore Back from their long and weary quest;— Had they not seen th' untrodden shore, And could they 'midst our wilds find rest? The lightning of their glance was fled, They dwelt amongst us as the dead! They lay beside our glittering rills, With visions in their darken'd eye, Their joy was not amidst the hills Where elk and deer before us fly; Their spears upon the cedar hung, Their javelins to the wind were flung. They bent no more the forest-bow, They arm'd not with the warrior-band, The moons waned o'er them dim and slow— They left us for the spirits' land! Beneath our pines yon greensward heap Shows where the restless found their sleep. Son of the stranger! if at eve Silence be 'midst us in thy place, Yet go not where the mighty leave The strength of battle and of chase! Let no vain dreams thy heart beguile, Oh! seek thou not the Fountain Isle! THE BENDED BOW. There was heard the sound of a coming foe, There was sent through Britain a bended bow; And a voice was pour'd on the free winds far, As the land rose up at the sign of war. “Heard you not the battle-horn?— Reaper! leave thy golden corn! Leave it for the birds of heaven, Swords must flash, and spears be riven! Leave it for the winds to shed— Arm! ere Britain's turf grow red!” And the reaper arm'd, like a freeman's son; And the bended bow and the voice pass'd on. “Hunter! leave the mountain-chase! Take the falchion from its place! Let the wolf go free to-day, Leave him for a nobler prey! Let the deer ungall'd sweep by,— Arm thee! Britain's foes are nigh!” And the hunter arm'd ere the chase was done; And the bended bow and the voice pass'd on. “Chieftain! quit the joyous feast! Stay not till the song hath ceased: Though the mead be foaming bright, Though the fires give ruddy light, Leave the hearth, and leave the hall— Arm thee! Britain's foes must fall.” And the chieftain arm'd, and the horn was blown; And the bended bow and the voice pass'd on. “Prince! thy father's deeds are told, In the bower and in the hold! Where the goatherd's lay is sung, Where the minstrel's harp is strung! Foes are on thy native sea— Give our bards a tale of thee!” And the prince came arm'd, like a leader's son; And the bended bow and the voice pass'd on. “Mother! stay thou not thy boy! He must learn the battle's joy. Sister! bring the sword and spear, Give thy brother words of cheer! Maiden! bid thy lover part, Britain calls the strong in heart!” And the bended bow and the voice pass'd on; And the bards made song for a battle won. HE NEVER SMILED AGAIN. The bark that held a prince went down, The sweeping waves roll'd on; And what was England's glorious crown To him that wept a son? He lived—for life may long be borne Ere sorrow break its chain; Why comes not death to those who mourn?— He never smiled again! There stood proud forms around his throne, The stately and the brave; But which could fill the place of one, That one beneath the wave? Before him pass'd the young and fair, In pleasure's reckless train; But seas dash'd o'er his son's bright hair— He never smiled again! He sat where festal bowls went round, He heard the minstrel sing, He saw the tourney's victor crown'd, Amidst the knightly ring: A murmur of the restless deep Was blent with every strain, A voice of winds that would not sleep— He never smiled again! Hearts, in that time, closed o'er the trace Of vows once fondly pour'd, And strangers took the kinsman's place At many a joyous board; Graves, which true love had bathed with tears, Were left to heaven's bright rain, Fresh hopes were born for other years— He never smiled again! CŒUR DE LION AT THE BIER OF HIS FATHER. Torches were blazing clear, Hymns pealing deep and slow, Where a king lay stately on his bier In the church of Fontevraud. Banners of battle o'er him hung, And warriors slept beneath, And light, as noon's broad light was flung On the settled face of death. On the settled face of death A strong and ruddy glare, Though dimm'd at times by the censer's breath, Yet it fell still brightest there: As if each deeply furrow'd trace Of earthly years to show,— Alas! that sceptred mortal's race Had surely closed in woe! The marble floor was swept By many a long dark stole, As the kneeling priests, round him that slept, Sang mass for the parted soul: And solemn were the strains they pour'd Through the stillness of the night, With the cross above, and the crown and sword, And the silent king in sight. There was heard a heavy clang, As of steel-girt men the tread, And the tombs and the hollow pavement rang With a sounding thrill of dread; And the holy chant was hush'd awhile, As, by the torch's flame, A gleam of arms up the sweeping aisle, With a mail-clad leader came. He came with haughty look, An eagle-glance and clear; But his proud heart through its breastplate shook, When he stood beside the bier! He stood there still with a drooping brow, And clasp'd hands o'er it raised;— For his father lay before him low, It was Cœur de Lion gazed! And silently he strove With the workings of his breast; But there's more in late repentant love Than steel may keep suppress'd! And his tears brake forth, at last, like rain,— Men held their breath in awe, For his face was seen by his warrior-train, And he reck'd not that they saw. He look'd upon the dead, And sorrow seem'd to lie, A weight of sorrow, even like lead, Pale on the fast-shut eye. He stoop'd—and kiss'd the frozen cheek, And the heavy hand of clay, Till bursting words—yet all too weak— Gave his soul's passion way. “Oh, father! is it vain, This late remorse and deep? Speak to me, father! once again, I weep—behold, I weep! Alas! my guilty pride and ire! Were but this work undone, I would give England's crown, my sire! To hear thee bless thy son. “Speak to me! mighty grief Ere now the dust hath stirr'd! Hear me, but hear me!—father, chief, My king! I must be heard!— Hush'd, hush'd—how is it that I call, And that thou answerest not? When was it thus, woe, woe for all The love my soul forgot! “Thy silver hairs I see, So still, so sadly bright! And father, father! but for me, They had not been so white! I bore thee down, high heart! at last, No longer couldst thou strive;— Oh! for one moment of the past, To kneel and say—‘forgive!’ “Thou wert the noblest king, On royal throne e'er seen; And thou didst wear in knightly ring, Of all, the stateliest mien; And thou didst prove, where spears are proved, In war, the bravest heart— Oh! ever the renown'd and loved Thou wert—and there thou art! “Thou that my boyhood's guide Didst take fond joy to be!— The times I've sported at thy side, And climb'd thy parent knee! And there before the blessed shrine, My sire! I see thee lie,— How will that sad still face of thine Look on me till I die!” THE VASSAL'S LAMENT FOR THE FALLEN TREE. Yes! I have seen the ancient oak On the dark deep water cast, And it was not fell'd by the woodman's stroke, Or the rush of the sweeping blast; For the axe might never touch that tree, And the air was still as a summer sea. I saw it fall, as falls a chief By an arrow in the fight, And the old woods shook, to their loftiest leaf, At the crashing of its might! And the startled deer to their coverts drew, And the spray of the lake as a fountain's flew! 'Tis fallen! but think thou not I weep For the forest's pride o'erthrown; An old man's tears lie far too deep To be pour'd for this alone! But by that sign too well I know, That a youthful head must soon be low! A youthful head, with its shining hair, And its bright quick-flashing eye— Well may I weep! for the boy is fair, Too fair a thing to die! But on his brow the mark is set— Oh! could my life redeem him yet! He bounded by me as I gazed Alone on the fatal sign, And it seem'd like sunshine when he raised His joyous glance to mine! With a stag's fleet step he bounded by, So full of life—but he must die! He must, he must! in that deep dell, By that dark water's side, 'Tis known that ne'er a proud tree fell But an heir of his fathers died. And he—there's laughter in his eye, Joy in his voice—yet he must die! I've borne him in these arms, that now Are nerveless and unstrung; And must I see, on that fair brow, The dust untimely flung? I must!—yon green oak, branch and crest, Lies floating on the dark lake's breast! The noble boy!—how proudly sprung The falcon from his hand! It seem'd like youth to see him young, A flower in his father's land! But the hour of the knell and the dirge is nigh, For the tree hath fall'n, and the flower must die. Say not 'tis vain!—I tell thee, some Are warn'd by a meteor's light, Or a pale bird, flitting, calls them home, Or a voice on the winds by night; And they must go!—and he too, he— Woe for the fall of the glorious Tree! THE WILD HUNTSMAN. Thy rest was deep at the slumberer's hour, If thou didst not hear the blast Of the savage horn from the mountain tower, As the Wild Night-Huntsman pass'd, And the roar of the stormy chase went by, Through the dark unquiet sky! The stag sprung up from his mossy bed When he caught the piercing sounds, And the oak-boughs crash'd to his antler'd head, As he flew from the viewless hounds; And the falcon soar'd from her craggy height, Away through the rushing night! The banner shook on its ancient hold, And the pine in its desert place, As the cloud and tempest onward roll'd With the din of the trampling race; And the glens were fill'd with the laugh and shout, And the bugle, ringing out! From the chieftain's hand the wine-cup fell, At the castle's festive board, And a sudden pause came o'er the swell Of the harp's triumphal chord; And the Minnesinger's Minnesinger, love-singer,—the wandering minstrels of Germany were so called in the middle ages. thrilling lay In the hall died fast away. The convent's chanted rite was stay'd, And the hermit dropp'd his beads, And a trembling ran through the forest-shade, At the neigh of the phantom steeds, And the church-bells peal'd to the rocking blast As the Wild Night-Huntsman pass'd. The storm hath swept with the chase away, There is stillness in the sky; But the mother looks on her son to-day, With a troubled heart and eye, And the maiden's brow hath a shade of care 'Midst the gleam of her golden hair! The Rhine flows bright; but its waves erelong Must hear a voice of war, And a clash of spears our hills among, And a trumpet from afar; And the brave on a bloody turf must lie, For the Huntsman hath gone by! THE SHADE OF THESEUS. AN ANCIENT GREEK TRADITION. Know ye not when our dead From sleep to battle sprung?— When the Persian charger's tread On their covering greensward rung. When the trampling march of foes Had crush'd our vines and flowers, When jewel'd crests arose Through the holy laurel bowers; When banners caught the breeze, When helms in sunlight shone, When masts were on the seas, And spears on Marathon. There was one, a leader crown'd, And arm'd for Greece that day; But the falchions made no sound On his gleaming war-array. In the battle's front he stood, With his tall and shadowy crest; But the arrows drew no blood, Though their path was through his breast. When banners caught the breeze, When helms in sunlight shone, When masts were on the seas, And spears on Marathon. His sword was seen to flash Where the boldest deeds were done; But it smote without a clash: The stroke was heard by none! His voice was not of those That swell'd the rolling blast, And his steps fell hush'd like snows— 'Twas the Shade of Theseus pass'd! When banners caught the breeze, When helms in sunlight shone, When masts were on the seas, And spears on Marathon. Far sweeping through the foe, With a fiery charge he bore; And the Mede left many a bow On the sounding ocean-shore. And the foaming waves grew red, And the sails were crowded fast, When the sons of Asia fled, As the shade of Theseus pass'd! When banners caught the breeze, When helms in sunlight shone, When masts were on the seas, And spears on Marathon. ANCIENT GREEK SONG OF EXILE. Where is the summer, with her golden sun?— That festal glory hath not pass'd from earth: For me alone the laughing day is done! Where is the summer with her voice of mirth? —Far in my own bright land? Where are the Fauns, whose flute-notes breathe and die On the green hills?—the founts, from sparry caves Through the wild places bearing melody? The reeds, low whispering o'er the river waves? —Far in my own bright land! Where are the temples, through the dim wood shining, The virgin-dances, and the choral strains? Where the sweet sisters of my youth, entwining The Spring's first roses for their sylvan fanes? —Far in my own bright land! Where are the vineyards, with their joyous throngs, The red grapes pressing when the foliage fades? The lyres, the wreaths, the lovely Dorian songs, And the pine forests, and the olive shades? —Far in my own bright land! Where the deep haunted grots, the laurel bowers, The Dryad's footsteps, and the minstrel's dreams?— Oh! that my life were as a southern flower's! I might not languish then by these chill streams, Far from my own bright land! GREEK FUNERAL CHANT, OR MYRIOLOGUE. A wail was heard around the bed, the deathbed of the young, Amidst her tears the Funeral Chant a mournful mother sung.— “Ianthis! dost thou sleep?—Thou sleep'st!—but this is not the rest, The breathing and the rosy calm, I have pillow'd on my breast! I lull'd thee not to this repose, Ianthis! my sweet son! As in thy glowing childhood's time by twilight I have done!— How is it that I bear to stand and look upon thee now? And that I die not, seeking death on thy pale glorious brow? “I look upon thee, thou that wert of all most fair and brave! I see thee wearing still too much of beauty for the grave! Though mournfully thy smile is fix'd, and heavily thine eye Hath shut above the falcon-glance that in it loved to lie; And fast is bound the springing step, that seem'd on breezes borne, When to thy couch I came and said,—‘Wake, hunter, wake! 'tis morn!’ Yet art thou lovely still, my flower! untouch'd by slow decay,— And I, the wither'd stem, remain—I would that grief might slay! “Oh! ever when I met thy look, I knew that this would be! I knew too well that length of days was not a gift for thee! I saw it in thy kindling cheek, and in thy bearing high;— A voice came whispering to my soul, and told me thou must die! That thou must die, my fearless one! where swords were flashing red.— Why doth a mother live to say—My first-born and my dead? They tell me of thy youthful fame, they talk of victory won— Speak thou, and I will hear! my child, Ianthis! my sweet son!” A wail was heard around the bed, the deathbed of the young, A fair-hair'd bride the Funeral Chant amidst her weeping sung.— “Ianthis! look'st thou not on me?—Can love indeed be fled? When was it woe before to gaze upon thy stately head? I would that I had follow'd thee, Ianthis, my beloved! And stood as woman oft hath stood where faithful hearts are proved! That I had bound a breastplate on, and battled at thy side— It would have been a blessed thing together had we died! “But where was I when thou didst fall beneath the fatal sword? Was I beside the sparkling fount, or at the peaceful board? Or singing some sweet song of old, in the shadow of the vine, Or praying to the saints for thee, before the holy shrine? And thou wert lying low the while, the life-drops from thy heart Fast gushing like a mountain-spring!—and couldst thou thus depart? Couldst thou depart, nor on my lips pour out thy fleeting breath?— Oh! I was with thee but in joy, that should have been in death! “Yes! I was with thee when the dance through mazy rings was led, And when the lyre and voice were tuned, and when the feast was spread! But not where noble blood flow'd forth, where sounding javelins flew— Why did I hear love's first sweet words, and not its last adieu? What now can breathe of gladness more,—what scene, what hour, what tone? The blue skies fade with all their lights; they fade, since thou art gone! Even that must leave me, that still face, by all my tears unmoved— Take me from this dark world with thee, Ianthis! my beloved!” A wail was heard around the bed, the deathbed of the young, Amidst her tears the Funeral Chant a mounrnful sister sung. “Ianthis! brother of my soul!—oh! where are now the days That laugh'd among the deep green hills, on all our infant plays? When we two sported by the streams, or track'd them to their source, And like a stag's, the rocks along, was thy fleet, fearless course!— I see the pines there waving yet, I see the rills descend, I see thy bounding step no more—my brother and my friend! “I come with flowers—for Spring is come! Ianthis! art thou here? I bring the garlands she hath brought, I cast them on thy bier! Thou shouldst be crown'd with victory's crown—but oh! more meet they seem, The first faint violets of the wood, and lilies of the stream! More meet for one so fondly loved, and laid thus early low— Alas! how sadly sleeps thy face amidst the sunshine's glow: The golden glow that through thy heart was wont such joy to send,— Woe! that it smiles, and not for thee!—my brother and my friend!” THE PARTING SONG. A Youth went forth to exile, from a home Such as to early thought gives images, The longest treasured, and most oft recall'd, And brightest kept, of love;—a mountain home, That, with the murmur of its rocking pines And sounding waters, first in childhood's heart Wakes the deep sense of nature unto joy, And half unconscious prayer;—a Grecian home, With the transparence of blue skies o'erhung, And, through the dimness of its olive shades, Catching the flash of fountains, and the gleam Of shining pillars from the fanes of old. And this was what he left!—Yet many leave Far more:—the glistening eye, that first from theirs Call'd out the soul's bright smile; the gentle hand, Which through the sunshine led forth infant steps To where the violets lay; the tender voice That earliest taught them what deep melody Lives in affection's tones.—He left not these. Happy the weeper, that but weeps to part With all a mother's love!—a bitterer grief Was his—to part unloved!—of her unloved That should have breath'd upon his heart, like spring Fostering its young faint flowers! Yet had he friends, And they went forth to cheer him on his way Unto the parting spot;—and she too went, That mother, tearless for her youngest-born. The parting spot was reach'd:—a lone deep glen, Holy, perchance, of youre, for cave and fount Were there, and sweet-voiced echoes; and above, The silence of the blue still upper heaven Hung round the crags of Pindus, where they wore Their crowning snows.—Upon a rock he sprung, The unbeloved one, for his home to gaze Through the wild laurels back; but then a light Broke on the stern proud sadness of his eye, A sudden quivering light, and from his lips A burst of passionate song. “Farewell, farewell! I hear thee, O thou rushing stream!—thou'rt from my native dell, Thou'rt bearing thence a mournful sound—a murmur of farewell! And fare thee well—flow on, my stream!—flow on, thou bright and free! I do but dream that in thy voice one tone laments for me; But I have been a thing unloved, from childhood's loving years, And therefore turns my soul to thee, for thou hast known my tears! The mountains, and the caves, and thou, my secret tears have known: The woods can tell where he hath wept, that ever wept alone! “I see thee once again, my home! thou'rt there amidst thy vines, And clear upon thy gleaming roof the light of summer shines. It is a joyous hour when eve comes whispering through thy groves, The hour that brings the son from toil, the hour the mother loves!— The hour the mother loves!—for me beloved it hath not been; Yet ever in its purple smile, thou smilest, a blessed scene! Whose quiet beauty o'er my soul through distant years will come— Yet what but as the dead, to thee, shall I be then, my home? “Not as the dead!—no, not the dead!—We speak of them—we keep Their names, like light that must not fade, within our bosoms deep! We hallow even the lyre they touch'd, we love the lay they sung, We pass with softer step the place they fill'd our band among! But I depart like sound, like dew, like aught that leaves on earth No trace of sorrow or delight, no memory of its birth! I go!—the echo of the rock a thousand songs may swell When mine is a forgotten voice.—Woods, mountains, home, farewell! “And farewell, mother!—I have borne in lonely silence long, But now the current of my soul grows passionate and strong! And I will speak! though but the wind that wanders through the sky, And but the dark, deep-rustling pines and rolling streams reply. Yes! I will speak!—within my breast whate'er hath seem'd to be, There lay a hidden fount of love, that would have gush'd for thee! Brightly it would have gush'd, but thou my mother! thou hast thrown Back on the forests and the wilds what should have been thine own! “Then fare thee well! I leave thee not in loneliness to pine, Since thou hast sons of statelier mien and fairer brow than mine! Forgive me that thou couldst not love!—it may be, that a tone Yet from my burning heart may pierce through thine, when I am gone! And thou, perchance, may'st weep for him on whom thou ne'er hast smiled, And the grave give his birthright back to thy neglected child! Might but my spirit then return, and 'midst its kindred dwell, And quench its thirst with love's free tears!—'Tis all a dream—farewell!” “Farewell!”—the echo died with that deep word; Yet died not so the late repentant pang By the strain quicken'd in the mother's breast! There had pass'd many changes o'er her brow, And cheek, and eye; but into one bright flood Of tears at last all melted; and she fell On the glad bosom of her child, and cried, “Return, return, my son!”—The echo caught A lovelier sound than song, and woke again, Murmuring—“Return, my son!”— THE SULIOTE MOTHER. She stood upon the loftiest peak, Amidst the clear blue sky: A bitter smile was on her cheek, And a dark flash in her eye. “Dost thou see them, boy?—through the dusky pines Dost thou see where the foeman's armour shines? Hast thou caught the gleam of the conqueror's crest? My babe, that I cradled on my breast! Wouldst thou spring from thy mother's arms with joy? —That sight hath cost thee a father, boy!” For in the rocky strait beneath, Lay Suliote sire and son: They had heap'd high the piles of death Before the pass was won. “They have cross'd the torrent, and on they come! Woe for the mountain hearth and home! There, where the hunter laid by his spear, There, where the lyre hath been sweet to hear, There, where I sang thee, fair babe! to sleep, Nought but the blood-stain our trace shall keep!” And now the horn's loud blast was heard, And now the cymbal's clang, Till even the upper air was stirr'd, As cliff and hollow rang. “Hark! they bring music, my joyous child! What saith the trumpet to Suli's wild! Doth it light thine eye with so quick a fire, As if at a glance of thine armed sire?— Still!—be thou still!—there are brave men low— Thou wouldst not smile couldst thou see him now!” But nearer came the clash of steel, And louder swell'd the horn, And farther yet the tambour's peal Through the dark pass was borne. “Hear'st thou the sound of their savage mirth?— Boy! thou wert free when I gave thee birth,— Free, and how cherish'd, my warrior's son! He too hath bless'd thee, as I have done! Ay, and unchain'd must his loved ones be— Freedom, young Suliote! for thee and me!” And from the arrowy peak she sprung, And fast the fair child bore:— A veil upon the wind was flung, A cry—and all was o'er! THE FAREWELL TO THE DEAD. —“'Tis hard to lay into the earth A countenance so benign! a form that walk'd But yesterday so stately o'er the earth!” Wilson. Come near!—ere yet the dust Soil the bright paleness of the settled brow, Look on your brother; and embrace him now, In still and solemn trust! Come near!—once more let kindred lips be press'd On his cold cheek; then bear him to his rest! Look yet on this young face! What shall the beauty, from amongst us gone, Leave of its image, even where most it shone, Gladdening its hearth and race? Dim grows the semblance on man's heart impress'd— Come near, and bear the beautiful to rest! Ye weep, and it is well! For tears befit earth's partings!—Yesterday, Song was upon the lips of this pale clay, And sunshine seem'd to dwell Where'er he moved—the welcome and the bless'd!— Now gaze! and bear the silent unto rest! Look yet on him whose eye Meets yours no more, in sadness or in mirth! Was he not fair amidst the sons of earth, The beings born to die?— But not where death has power may love be bless'd— Come near! and bear ye the beloved to rest! How may the mother's heart Dwell on her son, and dare to hope again? The Spring's rich promise hath been given in vain, The lovely must depart! Is he not gone, our brightest and our best? Come near! and bear the early-call'd to rest! Look on him! is he laid To slumber from the harvest or the chase?— Too still and sad the smile upon his face; Yet that, even that must fade! Death holds not long unchanged his fairest guest!— Come near! and bear the mortal to his rest! His voice of mirth hath ceased Amidst the vineyards! there is left no place For him whose dust receives your vain embrace, At the gay bridal feast! Earth must take earth to moulder on her breast; Come near! weep o'er him! bear him to his rest! Yet mourn ye not as they Whose spirit's light is quench'd!—for him the past Is seal'd. He may not fall, he may not cast His birth-right's hope away! All is not here of our beloved and bless'd— Leave ye the sleeper with his God to rest! MISCELLANEOUS PIECES. THE TREASURES OF THE DEEP. Originally introduced in the “Forest Sanctuary.” What hidest thou in thy treasure-caves and cells? Thou hollow-sounding and mysterious main!— Pale glistening pearls, and rainbow-colour'd shells, Bright things which gleam unreck'd of and in vain!— Keep, keep thy riches, melancholy sea! We ask not such from thee. Yet more, the depths have more!—what wealth untold, Far down, and shining through their stillness lies! Thou hast the starry gems, the burning gold, Won from ten thousand royal Argosies!— Sweep o'er thy spoils, thou wild and wrathful main! Earth claims not these again. Yet more, the depths have more!—thy waves have roll'd Above the cities of a world gone by! Sand hath fill'd up the palaces of old, Sea-weed o'ergrown the halls of revelry.— Dash o'er them, ocean! in thy scornful play! Man yields them to decay. Yet more! the billows and the depths have more! High hearts and brave are gather'd to thy breast! They hear not now the booming waters roar, The battle-thunders will not break their rest.— Keep thy red gold and gems, thou stormy grave! Give back the true and brave! Give back the lost and lovely!—those for whom The place was kept at board and hearth so long! The prayer went up through midnight's breathless gloom, And the vain yearning woke 'midst festal song! Hold fast thy buried isles, thy towers o'erthrown— But all is not thine own. To thee the love of woman hath gone down, Dark flow thy tides o'er manhood's noble head, O'er youth's bright locks, and beauty's flowery crown; Yet must thou hear a voice—Restore the dead! Earth shall reclaim her precious things from thee!— Restore the dead, thou sea! BRING FLOWERS. Bring flowers, young flowers, for the festal board, To wreath the cup ere the wine is pour'd: Bring flowers! they are springing in wood and vale: Their breath floats out on the southern gale; And the touch of the sunbeam hath waked the rose, To deck the hall where the bright wine flows. Bring flowers to strew in the conqueror's path— He hath shaken thrones with his stormy wrath! He comes with the spoils of nations back, The vines lie crush'd in his chariot's track, The turf looks red where he won the day— Bring flowers to die in the conqueror's way! Bring flowers to the captive's lonely cell, They have tales of the joyous woods to tell; Of the free blue streams, and the glowing sky, And the bright world shut from his languid eye; They will bear him a thought of the sunny hours, And the dream of his youth—bring him flowers, wild flowers! Bring flowers, fresh flowers, for the bride to wear! They were born to blush in her shining hair. She is leaving the home of her childhood's mirth, She hath bid farewell to her father's hearth, Her place is now by another's side— Bring flowers for the locks of the fair young bride! Bring flowers, pale flowers, o'er the bier to shed, A crown for the brow of the early dead! For this through its leaves hath the white rose burst, For this in the woods was the violet nursed! Though they smile in vain for what once was ours, They are love's last gift—bring ye flowers, pale flowers! Bring flowers to the shrine where we kneel in prayer, They are nature's offering, their place is there! They speak of hope to the fainting heart, With a voice of promise they come and part, They sleep in dust through the wintry hours, They break forth in glory—bring flowers, bright flowers! THE CRUSADER'S RETURN. “Alas! the mother that him bare, If she had been in presence there, In his wan cheeks and sunburnt hair She had not known her child.” Marmion. Rest, pilgrim, rest!—thou'rt from the Syrian land, Thou'rt from the wild and wondrous east, I know By the long-wither'd palm-branch in thy hand, And by the darkness of thy sunburnt brow. Alas! the bright, the beautiful, who part So full of hope, for that far country's bourne! Alas! the weary and the changed in heart, And dimm'd in aspect, who like thee return! Thou'rt faint—stay, rest thee from thy toils at last: Through the high chestnuts lightly plays the breeze, The stars gleam out, the Ave hour is past, The sailor's hymn hath died along the seas. Thou'rt faint and worn—hear'st thou the fountain welling By the grey pillars of yon ruin'd shrine? Seest thou the dewy grapes before thee swelling? —He that hath left me train'd that loaded vine! He was a child when thus the bower he wove, (Oh! hath a day fled since his childhood's time?) That I might sit and hear the sound I love, Beneath its shade—the convent's vesper-chime. And sit thou there!—for he was gentle ever, With his glad voice he would have welcomed thee, And brought fresh fruits to cool thy parch'd lips' fever— There in his place thou'rt resting—where is he? If I could hear that laughing voice again, But once again!—how oft it wanders by, In the still hours, like some remember'd strain, Troubling the heart with its wild melody!— Thou hast seen much, tired pilgrim! hast thou seen In that far land, the chosen land of yore, A youth—my Guido—with the fiery mien And the dark eye of this Italian shore? The dark, clear, lightning eye!—on heaven and earth It smiled—as if man were not dust it smiled! The very air seem'd kindling with his mirth, And I—my heart grew young before my child! My blessed child!—I had but him—yet he Fill'd all my home even with o'erflowing joy, Sweet laughter, and wild song, and footstep free— Where is he now?—my pride, my flower, my boy! His sunny childhood melted from my sight, Like a spring dew-drop—then his forehead wore A prouder look—his eye a keener light— I knew these woods might be his world no more! He loved me—but he left me!—thus they go Whom we have rear'd, watch'd, bless'd, too much adored! He heard the trumpet of the Red-Cross blow, And bounded from me with his father's sword! Thou weep'st—I tremble—thou hast seen the slain Pressing a bloody turf; the young and fair, With their pale beauty strewing o'er the plain Where hosts have met—speak! answer!—was he there? Oh! hath his smile departed?—Could the grave Shut o'er those bursts of bright and tameless glee?— No! I shall yet behold his dark locks wave— That look gives hope—I knew it could not be! Still weep'st thou, wand'rer?—some fond mother's glance O'er thee, too, brooded in thine early years— Think'st thou of her, whose gentle eye, perchance, Bathed all thy faded hair with parting tears? Speak, for thy tears disturb me!—what art thou? Why dost thou hide thy face, yet weeping on? Look up!—oh! is it—that wan cheek and brow!— Is it—alas! yet joy!—my son, my son! THE REVELLERS. Ring, joyous chords!—ring out again! A swifter still, and a wilder strain! They are here—the fair face and the careless heart, And stars shall wane ere the mirthful part.— But I met a dimly mournful glance, In a sudden turn of the flying dance; I heard the tone of a heavy sigh In a pause of the thrilling melody! And it is not well that woe should breathe On the bright spring-flowers of the festal wreath!— Ye that to thought or to grief belong, Leave, leave the hall of song! Ring, joyous chords!—but who art thou With the shadowy locks o'er thy pale, young brow, And the world of dreamy gloom that lies In the misty depths of thy soft dark eyes? Thou hast loved, fair girl! thou hast loved too well! Thou art mourning now o'er a broken spell; Thou hast pour'd thy heart's rich treasures forth, And art unrepaid for their priceless worth! Mourn on!—yet come thou not here the while, It is but a pain to see thee smile! There is not a tone in our songs for thee— Home with thy sorrows flee! Ring, joyous chords!—ring out again!— But what dost thou with the revel's train? A silvery voice through the soft air floats, But thou hast no part in the gladd'ning notes; There are bright young faces that pass thee by, But they fix no glance of thy wandering eye! Away, there's a void in thy yearning breast, Thou weary man! wilt thou here find rest? Away! for thy thoughts from the scene hath fled, And the love of thy spirit is with the dead! Thou art but more lone 'midst the sounds of mirth, Back to thy silent hearth! Ring, joyous chords!—ring forth again! A swifter still, and a wilder strain!— But thou, though a reckless mien be thine, And thy cup be crown'd with the foaming wine, By the fitful bursts of thy laughter loud, By thine eye's quick flash through its troubled cloud, I know thee! it is but the wakeful fear Of a haunted bosom that brings thee here! I know thee!—thou fearest the solemn night, With her piercing stars and her deep wind's might! There's a tone in her voice which thou fain would'st shun, For it asks what the secret soul hath done! And thou—there's a dark weight on thine—away!— Back to thy home, and pray! Ring joyous chords!—ring out again! A swifter still, and a wilder strain! And bring fresh wreaths!—we will banish all Save the free in heart from our festive hall. On! through the maze of the fleet dance, on!— But where are the young and the lovely?—gone! Where are the brows with the Red Cross crown'd, And the floating forms with the bright zone bound? And the waving locks and the flying feet, That still should be where the mirthful meet?— They are gone—they are fled—they are parted all— Alas! the forsaken hall! THE CONQUEROR'S SLEEP. Sleep 'midst thy banners furl'd! Yes! thou art there, upon thy buckler lying, With the soft wind unfelt around thee sighing, Thou chief of hosts, whose trumpet shakes the world! Sleep while the babe sleeps on its mother's breast— Oh! strong is night—for thou too art at rest! Stillness hath smooth'd thy brow, And now might love keep timid vigils by thee, Now might the foe with stealthy foot draw nigh thee, Alike unconscious and defenceless thou! Tread lightly, watchers!—now the field is won, Break not the rest of Nature's weary son! Perchance some lovely dream Back from the stormy fight thy soul is bearing, To the green places of thy boyish daring, And all the windings of thy native stream;— Why, this were joy!—upon the tented plain, Dream on, thou Conqueror!—be a child again! But thou wilt wake at morn, With thy strong passions to the conflict leaping, And thy dark troubled thoughts all earth o'er-sweeping; So wilt thou rise, oh! thou of woman born! And put thy terrors on, till none may dare Look upon thee—the tired one, slumbering there! Why, so the peasant sleeps Beneath his vine!—and man must kneel before thee, And for his birthright vainly still implore thee! Shalt thou be stay'd because thy brother weeps?— Wake! and forget that 'midst a dreaming world, Thou hast lain thus, with all thy banners furl'd! Forget that thou, even thou, Hast feebly shiver'd when the wind pass'd o'er thee And sunk to rest upon the earth which bore thee, And felt the night-dew chill thy fever'd brow! Wake with the trumpet, with the spear press on!— Yet shall the dust take home its mortal son. OUR LADY'S WELL. A beautiful spring in the woods near St. Asaph, formerly covered in with a chapel, now in ruins. It was dedicated to the Virgin, and, according to Pennant, much the resort of pilgrims.—See Vignette. Fount of the woods! thou art hid no more, From heaven's clear eye, as in time of yore. For the roof hath sunk from thy mossy walls, And the sun's free glance on thy slumber falls; And the dim tree-shadows across thee pass, As the boughs are sway'd o'er thy silvery glass; And the reddening leaves to thy breast are blown. When the autumn wind hath a stormy tone; And thy bubbles rise to the flashing rain— Bright Fount! thou art nature's own again! Fount of the vale! thou art sought no more By the pilgrim's foot, as in time of yore, When he came from afar, his beads to tell, And to chant his hymn at Our Lady's Well. There is heard no Ave through thy bowers, Thou art gleaming lone 'midst thy water-flowers! But the herd may drink from thy gushing wave, And there may the reaper his forehead lave, And the woodman seeks thee not in vain— Bright Fount! thou art nature's own again! Fount of the Virgin's ruin'd shrine! A voice that speaks of the past is thine! It mingles the tone of a thoughtful sigh, With the notes that ring through the laughing sky; 'Midst the mirthful song of the summer bird, And the sound of the breeze, it will yet be heard!— Why is it that thus we may gaze on thee, To the brilliant sunshine sparkling free?— 'Tis that all on earth is of Time's domain— He hath made thee nature's own again! Fount of the chapel with ages grey! Thou art springing freshly amidst decay; Thy rites are closed, and thy cross lies low, And the changeful hours breathe o'er thee now: Yet if at thine altar one holy thought In man's deep spirit of old hath wrought; If peace to the mourner hath here been given, Or prayer, from a chastened heart, to Heaven— Be the spot still hallow'd while Time shall reign, Who hath made thee nature's own again! THE PARTING OF SUMMER. Thou'rt bearing hence thy roses, Glad summer, fare thee well! Thou'rt singing thy last melodies In every wood and dell. But ere the golden sunset Of thy latest lingering day, Oh! tell me, o'er this chequered earth, How hast thou pass'd away? Brightly, sweet Summer! brightly Thine hours have floated by, To the joyous birds of the woodland boughs, The rangers of the sky. And brightly in the forests, To the wild deer wandering free; And brightly, 'midst the garden flowers, Is the happy murmuring bee: But how to human bosoms, With all their hopes and fears, And thoughts that make them eagle-wings, To pierce the unborn years? Sweet Summer! to the captive Thou hast flown in burning dreams Of the woods, with all their whispering leaves, And the blue rejoicing streams;— To the wasted and the weary On the bed of sickness bound, In swift delirious fantasies, That changed with every sound;— To the sailor on the billows, In longings, wild and vain, For the gushing founts and breezy hills, And the homes of earth again! And unto me, glad Summer! How hast thou flown to me? My chainless footstep nought hath kept From thy haunts of song and glee. Thou hast flown in wayward visions, In memories of the dead— In shadows from a troubled heart, O'er thy sunny pathway shed: In brief and sudden strivings To fling a weight aside— 'Midst these thy melodies have ceased, And all thy roses died. But oh! thou gentle Summer! If I greet thy flowers once more, Bring me again the buoyancy Wherewith my soul should soar! Give me to hail thy sunshine, With song and spirit free; Or in a purer air than this May that next meeting be! THE SONGS OF OUR FATHERS. ?“Sing aloud Old songs, the precious music of the heart.” Wordsworth. Sing them upon the sunny hills, When days are long and bright, And the blue gleam of shining rills Is loveliest to the sight! Sing them along the misty moor, Where ancient hunters roved, And swell them through the torrent's roar, The songs our fathers loved! The songs their souls rejoiced to hear When harps were in the hall, And each proud note made lance and spear Thrill on the banner'd wall: The songs that through our valleys green, Sent on from age to age, Like his own river's voice, have been The peasant's heritage. The reaper sings them when the vale Is fill'd with plumy sheaves; The woodman, by the starlight pale, Cheer'd homeward through the leaves: And unto them the glancing oars A joyous measure keep, Where the dark rocks that crest our shores Dash back the foaming deep. So let it be!—a light they shed O'er each old fount and grove; A memory of the gentle dead, A lingering spell of love. Murmuring the names of mighty men, They bid our streams roll on, And link high thoughts to every glen Where valiant deeds were done. Teach them your children round the hearth, When evening fires burn clear, And in the fields of harvest mirth, And on the hills of deer: So shall each unforgotten word, When far those loved ones roam, Call back the hearts which once it stirr'd, To childhood's holy home. The green woods of their native land Shall whisper in the strain, The voices of their household band Shall breathe their names again; The heathery heights in vision rise Where, like the stag, they roved— Sing to your sons those melodies, The songs your fathers loved! THE WORLD IN THE OPEN AIR. Come, while in freshness and dew it lies, To the world that is under the free, blue skies! Leave ye man's home, and forget his care— There breathes no sigh on the dayspring's air. Come to the woods, in whose mossy dells A light all made for the poet dwells; A light, colour'd softly by tender leaves, Whence the primrose a mellower glow receives. The stock-dove is there in the beechen tree, And the lulling tone of the honey-bee; And the voice of cool waters 'midst feathery fern, Shedding sweet sounds from some hidden urn. There is life, there is youth, there is tameless mirth, Where the streams, with the lilies they wear, have birth; There is peace where the alders are whispering low: Come from man's dwellings with all their woe! Yes! we will come—we will leave behind The homes and the sorrows of human kind: It is well to rove where the river leads Its bright blue vein along sunny meads: It is well through the rich wild woods to go, And to pierce the haunts of the fawn and doe; And to hear the gushing of gentle springs, Where the heart has been fretted by worldly stings; And to watch the colours that flit and pass, With insect-wings, through the wavy grass; And the silvery gleams o'er the ash-tree's bark, Borne in with a breeze through the foliage dark. Joyous and far shall our wanderings be, As the flight of birds o'er the glittering sea; To the woods, to the dingles where violets blow, We will bear no memory of earthly woe. But if, by the forest-brook, we meet A line like the pathway of former feet;— If, 'midst the hills, in some lonely spot, We reach the grey ruins of tower or cot;— If the cell, where a hermit of old hath pray'd, Lift up its cross through the solemn shade;— Or if some nook, where the wild-flowers wave, Bear token sad of a mortal grave,— Doubt not but there will our steps be stay'd, There our quick spirits awhile delay'd; There will thought fix our impatient eyes, And win back our hearts to their sympathies. For what, though the mountains and skies be fair, Steep'd in soft hues of the Summer-air,— 'Tis the soul of man, by its hopes and dreams, That lights up all nature with living gleams. Where it hath suffer'd and nobly striven, Where it hath pour'd forth its vows to heaven; Where to repose it hath brightly pass'd, O'er this green earth there is glory cast. And by that soul, 'midst groves and rills, And flocks that feed on a thousand hills, Birds of the forest, and flowers of the sod, We, only we, may be linked to God! KINDRED HEARTS. Oh! ask not, hope thou not too much Of sympathy below; Few are the hearts whence one same touch Bids the sweet fountains flow: Few—and by still conflicting powers Forbidden here to meet— Such ties would make this life of ours Too fair for aught so fleet. It may be, that thy brother's eye Sees not as thine, which turns In such deep reverence to the sky, Where the rich sunset burns: It may be, that the breath of spring, Born amidst violets lone, A rapture o'er thy soul can bring— A dream, to his unknown. The tune that speaks of other times— A sorrowful delight! The melody of distant chimes, The sound of waves by night, The wind that, with so many a tone, Some chord within can thrill,— These may have language all thine own, To him a mystery still. Yet scorn thou not, for this, the true And steadfast love of years; The kindly, that from childhood grew, The faithful to thy tears! If there be one that o'er the dead Hath in thy grief borne part, And watch'd through sickness by thy bed,— Call his a kindred heart! But for those bonds all perfect made, Wherein bright spirits blend, Like sister flowers of one sweet shade, With the same breeze that bend, For that full bliss of thought allied, Never to mortals given,— Oh! lay thy lovely dreams aside, Or lift them unto Heaven. THE TRAVELLER AT THE SOURCE OF THE NILE. In sunset's light, o'er Afric thrown, A wanderer proudly stood Beside the well-spring, deep and lone, Of Egypt's awful flood; The cradle of that mighty birth, So long a hidden thing to earth! He heard its life's first murmuring sound, A low mysterious tone; A music sought, but never found By kings and warriors gone; He listen'd—and his heart beat high— That was the song of victory! The rapture of a conqueror's mood Rush'd burning through his frame,— The depths of that green solitude Its torrents could not tame; Though stillness lay, with eve's last smile— Round those far fountains of the Nile. Night came with stars:—across his soul There swept a sudden change; E'en at the pilgrim's glorious goal A shadow dark and strange Breathed from the thought, so swift to fall O'er triumph's hour—and is this all? No more than this!—what seem'd it now First by that spring to stand? A thousand streams of lovelier flow Bathed his own mountain land! Whence, far o'er waste and ocean track, Their wild, sweet voices call'd him back. They call'd him back to many a glade, His childhood's haunt of play, Where brightly through the beechen shade Their waters glanced away; They call'd him, with their sounding waves, Back to his father's hills and graves. But, darkly mingling with the thought Of each familiar scene, Rose up a fearful vision, fraught With all that lay between; The Arab's lance, the desert's gloom, The whirling sands, the red simoom! Where was the glow of power and pride? The spirit born to roam? His alter'd heart within him died With yearnings for his home! All vainly struggling to repress That gush of painful tenderness. He wept—the stars of Afric's heaven Behold his bursting tears, E'en on that spot where fate had given The meed of toiling years!— Oh, happiness! how far we flee Thine own sweet paths in search of thee! CASABIANCA. The boy stood on the burning deck Whence all but he had fled; The flame that lit the battle's wreck, Shone round him o'er the dead. Yet beautiful and bright he stood, As born to rule the storm; A creature of heroic blood, A proud, though child-like form. The flames roll'd on—he would not go Without his Father's word; That Father, faint in death below, His voice no longer heard. He call'd aloud:—“Say, Father, say If yet my task is done?” He knew not that the chieftain lay Unconscious of his son. “Speak, Father!” once again he cried, “If I may yet be gone!” And but the booming shots replied, And fast the flames roll'd on. Upon his brow he felt their breath, And in his waving hair, And look'd from that lone post of death, In still, yet brave despair. And shouted but once more aloud, “My Father! must I stay?” While o'er him fast, through sail and shroud, The wreathing fires made way. They wrapt the ship in splendour wild, They caught the flag on high, And stream'd above the gallant child, Like banners in the sky. There came a burst of thunder sound— The boy—oh! where was he? Ask of the winds that far around With fragments strew'd the sea!— With mast, and helm, and pennon fair, That well had borne their part— But the noblest thing which perish'd there Was that young faithful heart! THE DIAL OF FLOWERS. This dial was, I believe, formed by Linnæus, and marked the hours by the opening and closing, at regular intervals, of the flowers arranged in it. 'Twas a lovely thought to mark the hours, As they floated in light away, By the opening and the folding flowers, That laugh to the summer's day. Thus had each moment its own rich hue, And its graceful cup and bell, In whose colour'd vase might sleep the dew, Like a pearl in an ocean-shell. To such sweet signs might the time have flow'd In a golden current on, Ere from the garden, man's first abode, The glorious guests were gone. So might the days have been brightly told— Those days of song and dreams— When shepherds gather'd their flocks of old By the blue Arcadian streams. So in those isles of delight, that rest Far off in a breezeless main, Which many a bark, with a weary quest, Has sought, but still in vain. Yet is not life, in its real flight, Mark'd thus—even thus—on earth, By the closing of one hope's delight, And another's gentle birth? Oh! let us live, so that flower by flower, Shutting in turn may leave A lingerer still for the sunset hour, A charm for the shaded eve. OUR DAILY PATHS. “Nought shall prevail against us, or disturb Our cheerful faith that all which we behold Is full of blessings.” Wordsworth. There's beauty all around our paths, if but our watchful eyes Can trace it 'midst familiar things, and through their lowly guise; We may find it where a hedge-row showers its blossoms o'er our way, Or a cottage window sparkles forth in the last red light of day. We may find it where a spring shines clear beneath an aged tree, With the foxglove o'er the water's glass, borne downwards by the bee; Or where a swift and sunny gleam on the birchen stems is thrown, As a soft wind playing parts the leaves, in copses green and lone, We may find it in the winter boughs, as they cross the cold, blue sky, While soft on icy pool and stream their pencil'd shadows lie, When we look upon their tracery, by the fairy frostwork bound, Whence the flitting redbreast shakes a shower of crystals to the ground. Yes! beauty dwells in all our paths—but sorrow too is there; How oft some cloud within us dims the bright, still summer air! When we carry our sick hearts abroad amidst the joyous things, That through the leafy places glance on many-colour'd wings, With shadows from the past we fill the happy woodland shades, And a mournful memory of the dead is with us in the glades; And our dream-like fancies lend the wind an echo's plaintive tone Of voices, and of melodies, and of silvery laughter gone. But are we free to do even thus—to wander as we will— Bearing sad visions through the grove, and o'er the breezy hill? No! in our daily paths lie cares, that ofttimes bind us fast, While from their narrow round we see the golden day fleet past. They hold us from the woodlark's haunts, and violet dingles, back, And from all the lovely sounds and gleams in the shining river's track; They bar us from our heritage of spring-time, hope, and mirth, And weigh our burden'd spirits down with the cumbering dust of earth. Yet should this be?—Too much, too soon, despondingly we yield! A better lesson we are taught by the lilies of the field! A sweeter by the birds of heaven—which tell us, in their flight, Of One that through the desert air for ever guides them right. Shall not this knowledge calm our hearts, and bid vain conflicts cease? Ay, when they commune with themselves in holy hours of peace; And feel that by the lights and clouds through which our pathway lies, By the beauty and the grief alike, we are training for the skies! THE CROSS IN THE WILDERNESS. Silent and mournful sat an Indian chief, In the red sunset, by a grassy tomb: His eyes, that might not weep, were dark with grief, And his arms folded in majestic gloom; And his bow lay unstrung, beneath the mound Which sanctified the gorgeous waste around. For a pale cross above its greensward rose, Telling the cedars and the pines that there Man's heart and hope had struggled with his woes, And lifted from the dust a voice of prayer. Now all was hush'd—and eve's last splendour shone With a rich sadness on th' attesting stone. There came a lonely traveller o'er the wild, And he, too, paused in reverence by that grave, Asking the tale of its memorial, piled Between the forest and the lake's bright wave; Till, as a wind might stir a wither'd oak, On the deep dream of age his accents broke. And the grey chieftain, slowly rising, said— “I listen'd for the words, which, years ago, Pass'd o'er these waters: though the voice is fled Which made them as a singing fountain's flow, Yet, when I sit in their long-faded track, Sometimes the forest's murmur gives them back. “Ask'st thou of him whose house is lone beneath? I was an eagle in my youthful pride, When o'er the seas he came, with summer's breath, To dwell amidst us, on the lake's green side. Many the times of flowers have been since then— Many, but bringing nought like him again! “Not with the hunter's bow and spear he came, O'er the blue hills to chase the flying roe; Not the dark glory of the woods to tame, Laying their cedars, like the corn-stalks, low; But to spread tidings of all holy things, Gladd'ning our souls, as with the morning's wings. “Doth not yon cypress whisper how we met, I and my brethren that from earth are gone, Under its boughs to hear his voice, which yet Seems through their gloom to send a silvery tone? He told of one, the grave's dark bands who broke, And our hearts burn'd within us as he spoke. “He told of far and sunny lands, which lie Beyond the dust wherein our fathers dwell: Bright must they be!—for there are none that die, And none that weep, and none that say ‘Farewell!’ He came to guide us thither; but away The Happy call'd him, and he might not stay. “We saw him slowly fade—athirst, perchance, For the fresh waters of that lovely clime; Yet was there still a sunbeam in his glance, And on his gleaming hair no touch of time— Therefore we hoped:—but now the lake looks dim, For the green summer comes—and finds not him! “We gather'd round him in the dewy hour Of one still morn, beneath his chosen tree; From his clear voice, at first, the words of power Came low, like moanings of a distant sea; But swell'd and shook the wilderness ere long, As if the spirit of the breeze grew strong. “And then once more they trembled on his tongue, And his white eyelids flutter'd, and his head Fell back, and mist upon his forehead hung— Know'st thou not how we pass to join the dead? It is enough!—he sank upon my breast— Our friend that loved us, he was gone to rest! “We buried him where he was wont to pray, By the calm lake, e'en here, at eventide; We rear'd this Cross in token where he lay, For on the Cross, he said, his Lord had died! Now hath he surely reach'd, o'er mount and wave, That flowery land whose green turf hides no grave. “But I am sad!—I mourn the clear light taken Back from my people, o'er whose place it shone, The pathway to the better shore forsaken, And the true words forgotten, save by one, Who hears them faintly sounding from the past, Mingled with death-songs in each fitful blast.” Then spoke the wand'rer forth with kindling eye: “Son of the wilderness! despair thou not, Though the bright hour may seem to thee gone by, And the cloud settled o'er thy nation's lot! Heaven darkly works—yet, where the seed hath been There shall the fruitage, glowing yet, be seen. “Hope on, hope ever!—by the sudden springing Of green leaves which the winter hid so long; And by the bursts of free, triumphant singing, After cold silent months, the woods among; And by the rending of the frozen chains, Which bound the glorious rivers on their plains; “Deem not the words of light that here were spoken, But as a lovely song, to leave no trace: Yet shall the gloom which wraps thy hills be broken, And the full dayspring rise upon thy race! And fading mists the better path disclose, And the wide desert blossom as the rose.” So by the Cross they parted, in the wild, Each fraught with musings for life's after-day, Memories to visit one, the forest's child, By many a blue stream in its lonely way; And upon one, 'midst busy throngs to press Deep thoughts and sad, yet full of holiness. LAST RITES. By the mighty minster's bell, Tolling with a sudden swell; By the colours half-mast high, O'er the sea hung mournfully; Know, a prince hath died! By the drum's dull muffled sound, By the arms that sweep the ground, By the volleying muskets' tone, Speak ye of a soldier gone In his manhood's pride. By the chanted psalm that fills Reverently the ancient hills, A custom still retained at rural funerals in some parts of England and Wales. Learn, that from his harvests done, Peasants bear a brother on To his last repose. By the pall of snowy white Through the yew-trees gleaming bright; By the garland on the bier, Weep! a maiden claims thy tear— Broken is the rose! Which is the tenderest rite of all?— Buried virgin's coronal, Requiem o'er the monarch's head, Farewell gun for warrior dead, Herdsman's funeral hymn? Tells not each of human woe! Each of hope and strength brought low? Number each with holy things, If one chastening thought it brings Ere life's day grow dim! THE HEBREW MOTHER. The rose was in rich bloom on Sharon's plain, When a young mother, with her first-born, thence Went up to Zion; for the boy was vow'd Unto the Temple service:—by the hand She led him, and her silent soul, the while, Oft as the dewy laughter of his eye Met her sweet serious glance, rejoiced to think That aught so pure, so beautiful, was hers, To bring before her God. So pass'd they on O'er Judah's hills; and wheresoe'er the leaves Of the broad sycamore made sounds at noon, Like lulling rain-drops, or the olive boughs, With their cool dimness, cross'd the sultry blue Of Syria's heaven, she paused, that he might rest: Yet from her own meek eyelids chased the sleep That weigh'd their dark fringe down, to sit and watch The crimson deepening o'er his cheek's repose, As at a red flower's heart. And where a fount Lay, like a twilight star, 'midst palmy shades, Making its bank green gems along the wild, There, too, she linger'd, from the diamond wave Drawing bright water for his rosy lips, And softly parting clusters of jet curls To bathe his brow. At last the fane was reach'd, The earth's one sanctuary—and rapture hush'd Her bosom, as before her, through the day, It rose, a mountain of white marble, steep'd In light like floating gold. But when that hour Waned to the farewell moment, when the boy Lifted, through rainbow-gleaming tears, his eye Beseechingly to hers, and half in fear Turn'd from the white-robed priest, and round her arm Clung even as joy clings—the deep spring-tide Of nature then swell'd high, and o'er her child Bending, her soul broke forth, in mingled sounds Of weeping and sad song.—“Alas!” she cried,— “Alas! my boy, thy gentle grasp is on me; The bright tears quiver in thy pleading eyes; And now fond thoughts arise, And silver cords again to earth have won me; And like a vine thou claspest my full heart— How shall I hence depart? “How the lone paths retrace where thou wert playing So late, along the mountains, at my side? And I, in joyous pride, By every place of flowers my course delaying, Wove, e'en as pearls, the lilies round thy hair, Beholding thee so fair! “And, oh! the home whence thy bright smile hath parted, Will it not seem as if the sunny day Turn'd from its door away? While through its chambers wandering, weary-hearted, I languish for thy voice, which past me still Went like a singing rill? “Under the palm-trees thou no more shalt meet me, When from the fount at evening I return, With the full water-urn; Nor will thy sleep's low dove-like breathings greet me, As 'midst the silence of the stars I wake, And watch for thy dear sake. “And thou, will slumber's dewy cloud fall round thee, Without thy mother's hand to smooth thy bed? Wilt thou not vainly spread Thine arms, when darkness as a veil hath wound thee, To fold my neck, and lift up, in thy fear, A cry which none shall hear? “What have I said, my child!—Will He not hear thee, Who the young ravens heareth from their nest? Shall He not guard thy rest, And, in the hush of holy midnight hear thee, Breathe o'er thy soul, and fill its dreams with joy? Thou shalt sleep soft, my boy. “I give thee to thy God—the God that gave thee, A well-spring of deep gladness to my heart! And, precious as thou art, And pure as dew of Hermon, He shall have thee, My own, my beautiful, my undefiled! And thou shalt be His child. “Therefore, farewell!—I go, my soul may fail me, As the hart panteth for the water brooks, Yearning for thy sweet looks. But thou, my first-born, droop not, nor bewail me; Thou in the Shadow of the Rock shalt dwell, The Rock of Strength.—Farewell!” THE WRECK. All night the booming minute-gun Had peal'd along the deep, And mournfully the rising sun Look'd o'er the tide-worn steep. A barque from India's coral strand, Before the raging blast, Had vail'd her topsails to the sand, And bow'd her noble mast. The queenly ship!—brave hearts had striven, And true ones died with her!— We saw her mighty cable riven, Like floating gossamer. We saw her proud flag struck that morn, A star once o'er the seas— Her anchor gone, her deck uptorn— And sadder things than these! We saw her treasures cast away,— The rocks with pearls were sown, And strangely sad, the ruby's ray Flash'd out o'er fretted stone. And gold was strewn the wet sands o'er, Like ashes by a breeze; And gorgeous robes—but oh! that shore Had sadder things than these! We saw the strong man still and low, A crush'd reed thrown aside; Yet, by that rigid lip and brow, Not without strife he died. And near him on the sea-weed lay— Till then we had not wept— But well our gushing hearts might say, That there a mother slept! For her pale arms a babe had press'd With such a wreathing grasp, Billows had dash'd o'er that fond breast, Yet not undone the clasp. Her very tresses had been flung To wrap the fair child's form, Where still their wet long streamers hung All tangled by the storm. And beautiful, 'midst that wild scene, Gleam'd up the boy's dead face, Like slumber's, trustingly serene, In melancholy grace. Deep in her bosom lay his head, With half-shut violet-eye— He had known little of her dread, Nought of her agony! Oh! human love, whose yearning heart Through all things vainly true, So stamps upon thy mortal part Its passionate adieu— Surely thou hast another lot: There is some home for thee, Where thou shalt rest, rememb'ring not The moaning of the sea! THE TRUMPET. The trumpet's voice hath roused the land— Light up the beacon-pyre!— A hundred hills have seen the brand, And waved the sign of fire. A hundred banners to the breeze, Their gorgeous folds have cast— And, hark! was that the sound of seas? A king to war went past. The chief is arming in his hall, The peasant by his hearth; The mourner hears the thrilling call, And rises from the earth. The mother on her first-born son, Looks with a boding eye— They come not back, though all be won, Whose young hearts leap so high. The bard hath ceased his song, and bound The falchion to his side; E'en for the marriage altar crown'd, The lover quits his bride. And all this haste, and change, and fear, By earthly clarion spread!— How will it be when kingdoms hear The blast that wakes the dead? EVENING PRAYER, AT A GIRLS' SCHOOL. “Now in thy youth, beseech of Him Who giveth, upbraiding not; That his light in thy heart become not dim, And his love be unforgot; And thy God, in the darkest of days, will be, Greenness, and beauty, and strength to thee.” Bernard Barton. Hush! 'tis a holy hour—the quiet room Seems like a temple, while yon soft lamp sheds A faint and starry radiance, through the gloom And the sweet stillness, down on fair young heads, With all their clust'ring locks, untouch'd by care, And bow'd, as flowers are bow'd with night, in prayer. Gaze on—'tis lovely!—Childhood's lip and cheek, Mantling beneath its earnest brow of thought— Gaze—yet what seest thou in those fair, and meek, And fragile things, as but for sunshine wrought?— Thou seest what grief must nurture for the sky, What death must fashion for eternity! O! joyous creatures! that will sink to rest, Lightly, when those pure orisons are done, As birds with slumber's honey-dew opprest, 'Midst the dim folded leaves, at set of sun— Lift up your hearts! though yet no sorrow lies Dark in the summer-heaven of those clear eyes. Though fresh within your breasts th' untroubled springs Of hope make melody where'er ye tread, And o'er your sleep bright shadows, from the wings Of spirits visiting but youth, be spread; Yet in those flute-like voices, mingling low, Is woman's tenderness—how soon her woe! Her lot is on you—silent tears to weep, And patient smiles to wear through suffering's hour, And sumless riches, from affection's deep, To pour on broken reeds—a wasted shower! And to make idols, and to find them clay, And to bewail that worship—therefore pray! Her lot is on you—to be found untired, Watching the stars out by the bed of pain, With a pale cheek, and yet a brow inspired, And a true heart of hope, though hope be vain; Meekly to bear with wrong, to cheer decay, And, oh! to love through all things—therefore pray! And take the thought of this calm vesper time, With its low murmuring sounds and silvery light, On through the dark days fading from their prime, As a sweet dew to keep your souls from blight! Earth will forsake—O! happy to have given Th' unbroken heart's first fragrance unto Heaven. THE HOUR OF DEATH. “Il est dans la Nature d'aimer à se livrer à l'idée même qu'on redoute.” Corinne. Leaves have their time to fall, And flowers to wither at the north-wind's breath, And stars to set—but all, Thou hast all seasons for thine own, O Death! Day is for mortal care, Eve, for glad meetings round the joyous hearth, Night, for the dreams of sleep, the voice of prayer— But all for thee, thou mightiest of the earth. The banquet hath its hour, Its feverish hour, of mirth, and song, and wine; There comes a day for grief's o'er whelming power, A time for softer tears—but all are thine. Youth and the opening rose May look like things too glorious for decay, And smile at thee—but thou art not of those That wait the ripen'd bloom to seize their prey. Leaves have their time to fall, And flowers to wither at the north-wind's breath, And stars to set—but all, Thou hast all seasons for thine own, O Death! We know when moons shall wane, When Summer-birds from far shall cross the sea, When autumn's hue shall tinge the golden grain— But who shall teach us when to look for thee! Is it when Spring's first gale Comes forth to whisper where the violets lie? Is it when roses in our paths grow pale?— They have one season—all are ours to die! Thou art where billows foam, Thou art where music melts upon the air; Thou art around us in our peaceful home, And the world calls us forth—and thou art there. Thou art where friend meets friend, Beneath the shadow of the elm to rest— Thou art where foe meets foe, and trumpets rend The skies, and swords beat down the princely crest. Leaves have their time to fall, And flowers to wither at the north-wind's breath, And stars to set—but all, Thou hast all seasons for thine own, O Death! THE LOST PLEIAD. “Like the lost Pleiad seen no more below.” —Byron. And is there glory from the heavens departed?— O void unmark'd!—thy sisters of the sky Still hold their place on high Though from its rank thine orb so long hath started, Thou, that no more art seen of mortal eye! Hath the night lost a gem, the regal night? She wears her crown of old magnificence, Though thou art exiled thence— No desert seems to part those urns of light, 'Midst the far depths of purple gloom intense. They rise in joy, the starry myriads burning— The shepherd greets them on his mountains free; And from the silvery sea To them the sailor's wakeful eye is turning— Unchanged they rise, they have not mourn'd for thee. Couldst thou be shaken from thy radiant place, Even as a dew-drop from the myrtle spray, Swept by the wind away? Wert thou not peopled by some glorious race, And was there power to smite them with decay? Why, who shall talk of thrones, of sceptres riven?— Bow'd be our hearts to think on what we are, When from its height afar A world sinks thus—and yon majestic heaven Shines not the less for that one vanish'd star! THE CLIFFS OF DOVER. “The inviolate Island of the sage and free.” —Byron. Rocks of my country! let the cloud Your crested heights array, And rise ye like a fortress proud, Above the surge and spray! My spirit greets you as ye stand, Breasting the billow's foam: O! thus forever guard the land, The sever'd land of home! I have left rich blue skies behind, Lighting up classic shrines; And music in the southern wind; And sunshine on the vines. The breathings of the myrtle flowers Have floated o'er my way; The pilgrim's voice, at vesper-hours, Hath soothed me with its lay. The isles of Greece, the hills of Spain, The purple heavens of Rome,— Yes, all are glorious;—yet again I bless thee, land of home! For thine the Sabbath peace, my land! And thine the guarded hearth; And thine the dead, the noble band, That make thee holy earth. Their voices meet me in thy breeze; Their steps are on thy plains; Their names, by old majestic trees, Are whisper'd round thy fanes. Their blood hath mingled with the tide Of thine exulting sea: O be it still a joy, a pride, To live and die for thee! THE GRAVES OF MARTYRS. The kings of old have shrine and tomb In many a minster's haughty gloom; And green, along the ocean side, The mounds arise where heroes died; But show me, on thy flowery breast, Earth! where thy nameless martyrs rest! The thousands that, uncheer'd by praise, Have made one offering of their days; For Truth, for Heaven, for Freedom's sake, Resign'd the bitter cup to take; And silently, in fearless faith, Bowing their noble souls to death. Where sleep they, Earth?—by no proud stone Their narrow couch of rest is known; The still sad glory of their name Hallows no mountain unto Fame; No—not a tree the record bears Of their deep thoughts and lonely prayers. Yet haply all around lie strew'd The ashes of that multitude: It may be that each day we tread, Where thus devoted hearts have bled; And the young flowers our children sow, Take root in holy dust below. O that the many-rustling leaves, Which round our homes the summer weaves, Or that the streams, in whose glad voice Our own familiar paths rejoice, Might whisper through the starry sky, To tell where those blest slumberers lie! Would not our inmost hearts be still'd, With knowledge of their presence fill'd, And by its breathings taught to prize The meekness of self-sacrifice? —But the old woods and sounding waves Are silent of those hidden graves. Yet what if no light footstep there In pilgrim-love and awe repair, So let it be!—like him, whose clay Deep buried by his Maker lay, They sleep in secret,—but their sod, Unknown to man, is mark'd of God! THE HOUR OF PRAYER. “Pregar, pregar, pregar, Ch' altro ponno i mortali al pianger nati?” Alfieri. Child, amidst the flowers at play, While the red light fades away; Mother, with thine earnest eye, Ever following silently; Father, by the breeze of eve Call'd thy harvest work to leave— Pray: ere yet the dark hours be, Lift the heart and bend the knee! Traveller, in the stranger's land, Far from thine own household band; Mourner, haunted by the tone Of a voice from this world gone; Captive, in whose narrow cell Sunshine hath not leave to dwell; Sailor, on the darkening sea— Lift the heart and bend the knee! Warrior, that from battle won Breathest now at set of sun; Woman, o'er the lowly slain Weeping on his burial-plain; Ye that triumph, ye that sigh, Kindred by one holy tie, Heaven's first star alike ye see— Lift the heart and bend the knee! THE VOICE OF HOME TO THE PRODIGAL. “Von Bäumen, aus Wellen, aus Mauern, Wie ruft es dir freundlich und lind; Was hast du zu wandern, zu trauern? Komm' spielen, du freundliches Kind!” La Motte Fouqué. O! when wilt thou return To thy spirit's early loves? To the freshness of the morn, To the stillness of the groves? The Summer-birds are calling Thy household porch around, And the merry waters falling With sweet laughter in their sound. And a thousand bright-vein'd flowers, From their banks of moss and fern, Breathe of the sunny hours— But when wilt thou return? Oh! thou hast wander'd long From thy home without a guide; And thy native woodland song, In thine alter'd heart hath died. Thou hast flung the wealth away, And the glory of thy Spring; And to thee the leaves' light play Is a long-forgotten thing. But when wilt thou return?— Sweet dews may freshen soon The flower, within whose urn Too fiercely gazed the noon. O'er the image of the sky, Which the lake's clear bosom wore, Darkly may shadows lie— But not for evermore. Give back thy heart again To the freedom of the woods, To the birds' triumphant strain, To the mountain solitudes! But when wilt thou return? Along thine own pure air, There are young sweet voices borne— Oh! should not thine be there? Still at thy father's board There is kept a place for thee; And, by thy smile restored, Joy round the hearth shall be. Still hath thy mother's eye, Thy coming step to greet, A look of days gone by, Tender and gravely sweet. Still, when the prayer is said, For thee kind bosoms yearn, For thee fond tears are shed— Oh! when wilt thou return? THE WAKENING. How many thousands are wakening now! Some to the songs from the forest-bough, To the rustling of leaves at the lattice-pane, To the chiming fall of the early rain. And some far out on the deep mid-sea, To the dash of the waves in their foaming glee, As they break into spray on the ship's tall side, That holds through the tumult her path of pride. And some—O! well may their hearts rejoice— To the gentle sound of a mother's voice! Long shall they yearn for that kindly tone, When from the board and the hearth 'tis gone. And some in the camp, to the bugle's breath, And the tramp of the steed on the echoing heath, And the sudden roar of the hostile gun, Which tells that a field must ere night be won. And some, in the gloomy convict-cell, To the dull deep note of the warning-bell, As it heavily calls them forth to die, When the bright sun mounts in the laughing sky. And some to the peal of the hunter's horn, And some to the din from the city borne, And some to the rolling of torrent-floods, Far 'midst old mountains and solemn woods. So are we roused on this chequer'd earth: Each unto light hath a daily birth; Though fearful or joyous, though sad or sweet, Are the voices which first our upspringing meet. But one must the sound be, and one the call, Which from the dust shall awaken us all: One!—but to sever'd and distant dooms. How shall the sleepers arise from the tombs? THE BREEZE FROM SHORE. Joy is upon the lonely seas, When Indian forests pour Forth, to the billow and the breeze, Their odours from the shore; Joy, when the soft air's fanning sigh Bears on the breath of Araby. Oh! welcome are the winds that tell A wand'rer of the deep, Where, far away, the jasmines dwell, And where the myrrh-trees weep! Blest, on the sounding surge and foam, Are tidings of the citron's home! The sailor at the helm they meet, And hope his bosom stirs, Upspringing, 'midst the waves, to greet The fair earth's messengers. That woo him, from the moaning main, Back to her glorious bowers again. They woo him, whispering lovely tales Of many a flowering glade, And fount's bright gleam, in island vales Of golden-fruited shade: Across his lone ship's wake they bring A vision and a glow of Spring. And O! ye masters of the lay, Come not even thus your songs That meet us on life's weary way, Amidst her toiling throngs? Yes! o'er the spirit thus they bear A current of celestial air. Their power is from the brighter clime That in our birth hath part; Their tones are of the world, which time Sears not within the heart: They tell us of the living light In its green places ever bright. They call us, with a voice divine, Back to our early love,— Our vows of youth at many a shrine, Whence far and fast we rove. Welcome high thought and holy strain That make us Truth's and Heaven's again! THE DYING IMPROVISATORE. Sestini, the Roman Improvisatore, when on his deathbed at Paris, is said to have poured forth a Farewell to Italy, in his most impassioned poetry. “My heart shall be pour'd over thee—and break.” Prophecy of Dante. The spirit of my land, It visits me once more!—though I must die Far from the myrtles which thy breeze hath fann'd, My own bright Italy! It is, it is thy breath, Which stirs my soul e'en yet, as wavering flame Is shaken by the wind;—in life and death Still trembling, yet the same! Oh! that love's quenchless power Might waft my voice to fill thy summer sky, And through thy groves its dying music shower Italy! Italy! The nightingale is there, The sunbeam's glow, the citron-flower's perfume, The south-wind's whisper in the scented air— It will not pierce the tomb! Never, oh! never more, On my Rome's purple heaven mine eye shall dwell, Or watch the bright waves melt along thy shore— My Italy! farewell! Alas!—thy hills among, Had I but left a memory of my name, Of love and grief one deep, true, fervent song, Unto immortal fame! But like a lute's brief tone, Like a rose-odour on the breezes cast, Like a swift flush of dayspring, seen and gone, So hath my spirit pass'd— Pouring itself away As a wild bird amidst the foliage turns That which within him triumphs, beats, or burns, Into a fleeting lay; That swells, and floats, and dies, Leaving no echo to the summer woods Of the rich breathings and impassion'd sighs, Which thrill'd their solitudes. Yet, yet remember me! Friends! that upon its murmurs oft have hung, When from my bosom, joyously and free, The fiery fountain sprung. Under the dark rich blue Of midnight heavens, and on the star-lit sea, And when woods kindle into Spring's first hue, Sweet friends! remember me! And in the marble halls, Where life's full glow the dreams of beauty wear, And poet-thoughts embodied light the walls, Let me be with you there! Fain would I bind, for you, My memory with all glorious things to dwell; Fain bid all lovely sounds my name renew— Sweet friends! bright land! farewell! MUSIC OF YESTERDAY. “O! mein Geist, ich fühle es in mir, strebt nach etwas Ueberirdischem, das keinem Menschen gegönnt ist.”—Tieck. The chord, the harp's full chord is hush'd, The voice hath died away, Whence music, like sweet waters, gush'd, But yesterday. Th' awakening note, the breeze-like swell, The full o'ersweeping tone, The sounds that sigh'd “Farewell, farewell!” Are gone—all gone! The love, whose fervent spirit pass'd With the rich measure's flow; The grief, to which it sank at last— Where are they now? They are with the scents, by Summer's breath Borne from a rose now shed: With the words from lips long seal'd in death— For ever fled. The sea-shell, of its native deep A moaning thrill retains; But earth and air no record keep Of parted strains. And all the memories, all the dreams, They woke in floating by; The tender thoughts, th' Elysian gleams— Could these too die? They died—as on the water's breast The ripple melts away, When the breeze that stirr'd it sinks to rest— So perish'd they! Mysterious in their sudden birth, And mournful in their close, Passing, and finding not on earth Aim or repose. Whence were they?—like the breath of flowers Why thus to come and go? A long, long journey must be ours Ere this we know! THE FORSAKEN HEARTH. “Was mir fehlt?—Mir fehlt ja alles, Bin so ganz verlassen hier!” Tyrolese Melody. The Hearth, the Hearth is desolate, the fire is quench'd and gone That into happy children's eyes once brightly laughing shone; The place where mirth and music met is hush'd through day and night. Oh! for one kind, one sunny face, of all that there made light! But scatter'd are those pleasant smiles afar by mount and shore, Like gleaming waters from one spring dispersed to meet no more. Those kindred eyes reflect not now each other's joy or mirth, Unbound is that sweet wreath of home—alas! the lonely Hearth! The voices that have mingled here now speak another tongue, Or breathe, perchance, to alien ears the songs their mother sung. Sad, strangely sad, in stranger lands, must sound each household tone,— The Hearth, the Hearth is desolate, the bright fire quench'd and gone. But are they speaking, singing yet, as in their days of glee? Those voices, are they lovely still, still sweet on earth or sea?— Oh! some are hush'd, and some are changed, and never shall one strain Blend their fraternal cadences triumphantly again! And of the hearts that here were link'd by long-remember'd years, Alas! the brother knows not now when fall the sister's tears! One haply revels at the feast, while one may droop alone, For broken is the household chain, the bright fire quench'd and gone! Not so—'tis not a broken chain—thy memory binds them still, Thou holy Hearth of other days, though silent now and chill! The smiles, the tears, the rites beheld by thine attesting stone, Have yet a living power to mark thy children for thine own. The father's voice, the mother's prayer, though call'd from earth away, With music rising from the dead, their spirits yet shall sway; And by the past, and by the grave, the parted yet are one, Though the loved Hearth be desolate, the bright fire quench'd and gone! THE DREAMER. “There is no such thing as forgetting, possible to the mind; a thousand accidents may, and will, interpose a veil between our present consciousness and the secret inscription on the mind; but alike, whether veiled or unveiled, the inscription remains for ever.” English Opium-Eater. “Thou hast been call'd, O Sleep! the friend of woe, But 'tis the happy who have call'd thee so.” Southey. Peace to thy dreams!—thou art slumbering now, The moonlight's calm is upon thy brow; All the deep love that o'erflows thy breast Lies 'midst the hush of thy heart at rest, Like the scent of a flower in its folded bell, When eve through the woodlands hath sigh'd fare-well. Peace!—the sad memories that through the day With a weight on thy lonely bosom lay, The sudden thoughts of the changed and dead, That bow'd thee as winds bow the willow's head, The yearnings for faces and voices gone— All are forgotten!—Sleep on, sleep on! Are they forgotten?—It is not so! Slumber divides not the heart from its woe. E'en now o'er thine aspect swift changes pass, Like lights and shades over wavy grass: Tremblest thou, Dreamer?—O love and grief! Ye have storms that shake e'en the closed-up leaf! On thy parted lips there's a quivering thrill, As on a lyre ere its chords are still; On the long silk lashes that fringe thine eye, There's a large tear gathering heavily; A rain from the clouds of thy spirit press'd— Sorrowful Dreamer! this is not rest! It is Thought at work amidst buried hours It is Love keeping vigil o'er perish'd flowers.— Oh! we bear within us mysterious things; Of Memory and Anguish, unfathom'd springs; And Passion—those gulfs of the heart to fill With bitter waves, which it ne'er may still. Well might we pause ere we gave them sway, Flinging the peace of our couch away! Well might we look on our souls in fear, They find no fount of oblivion here! They forget not, the mantle of sleep beneath— How know we if under the wings of death? THE WINGS OF THE DOVE. “Oh! that I had wings like a dove, for then would I fly away, and be at rest.”—Psalm lv. Oh! for thy wings, thou dove! Now sailing by with sunshine on thy breast; That, borne like thee above, I too might flee away, and be at rest! Where wilt thou fold those plumes, Bird of the forest-shadows, holiest bird? In what rich leafy glooms, By the sweet voice of hidden waters stirr'd? Over what blessed home, What roof with dark, deep Summer foliage crown'd, O! fair as ocean's foam! Shall thy bright bosom shed a gleam around? Or seek'st thou some old shrine Of nymph or saint, no more by votary woo'd, Though still, as if divine, Breathing a spirit o'er the solitude? Yet wherefore ask thy way? Blest, ever blest, whate'er its aim, thou art! Unto the greenwood spray, Bearing no dark remembrance at thy heart! No echoes that will blend A sadness with the whispers of the grove; No memory of a friend Far off, or dead, or changed to thee, thou dove! Oh! to some cool recess Take, take me with thee on the summer wind, Leaving the weariness And all the fever of this life behind: The aching and the void Within the heart, whereunto none reply, The young bright hopes destroy'd— Bird! bear me with thee through the sunny sky! Wild wish, and longing vain, And brief upspringing to be glad and free! Go to thy woodland reign: My soul is bound and held—I may not flee. For even by all the fears And thoughts that haunt my dreams—untold, unknown And burning woman's tears, Pour'd from mine eyes in silence and alone; Had I thy wings, thou dove! High 'midst the gorgeous isles of cloud to soar, Soon the strong cords of love Would draw me earthwards—homewards—yet once more. PSYCHE BORNE BY ZEPHYRS TO THE ISLAND OF PLEASURE. Written for a picture in which Psyche, on her flight upwards, is represented looking back sadly and anxiously to the earth. “Souvent l'ame, fortifiée par la contemplation des choses divines, voudroit déployer ses ailes vers le ciel. Elle croit qu'au terme de sa carriè un rideau va se lever pour lui découvrir des scènes de lumière: mais quand la mort touche son corps périssable, elle jette un regard en arrière vers les plaisirs terrestes et vers ses compagnes mortelles.”Schlegel, translated by Madame De Staël. Fearfully and mournfully Thou bidd'st the earth farewell, And yet thou'rt passing, loveliest one! In a brighter land to dwell. Ascend, ascend rejoicing! The sunshine of that shore Around thee, as a glorious robe, Shall stream for evermore. The breezy music wandering There through th' Elysian sky, Hath no deep tone that seems to float From a happier time gone by. And there the day's last crimson Gives no sad memories birth, No thought of dead or distant friends, Or partings—as on earth. Yet fearfully and mournfully Thou bidd'st that earth farewell, Although thou'rt passing, loveliest one! In a brighter land to dwell. A land where all is deathless— The sunny wave's repose, The wood with its rich melodies, The summer and its rose. A land that sees no parting, That hears no sound of sighs, That waits thee with immortal air— Lift, lift those anxious eyes! Oh! how like thee, thou trembler! Man's spirit fondly clings With timid love, to this, its world Of old familiar things! We pant, we thirst for fountains That gush not here below! On, on we toil, allured by dreams Of the living water's flow: We pine for kindred natures To mingle with our own; For communings more full and high Than aught by mortal known: We strive with brief aspirings Against our bonds in vain; Yet summon'd to be free at last, We shrink—and clasp our chain; And fearfully and mournfully We bid the earth farewell, Though passing from its mists, like thee, In a brighter world to dwell. THE BOON OF MEMORY. “Many things answered me.” —Manfred. I go, I go!—and must mine image fade From the green spots wherein my childhood play'd, By my own streams? Must my life part from each familiar place, As a bird's song, that leaves the woods no trace Of its lone themes? Will the friend pass my dwelling, and forget The welcomes there, the hours when we have met In grief or glee? All the sweet counsel, the communion high, The kindly words of trust, in days gone by, Pour'd full and free? A boon, a talisman, O Memory! give, To shrine my name in hearts where I would live For evermore! Bid the wind speak of me where I have dwelt, Bid the stream's voice, of all my soul hath felt, A thought restore! In the rich rose, whose bloom I loved so well, In the dim brooding violet of the dell, Set deep that thought! And let the sunset's melancholy glow, And let the Spring's first whisper, faint and low, With me be fraught! And memory answer'd me:—“Wild wish and vain! I have no hues the loveliest to detain In the heart's core. The place they held in bosoms all their own, Soon with new shadows fill'd, new flowers o'ergrown, Is theirs no more.” Hast thou such power, O Love?—And Love replied, “It is not mine! Pour out thy soul's full tide Of hope and trust, Prayer, tear, devotedness, that boon to gain— 'Tis but to write with the heart's fiery rain, Wild words on dust!” Song, is the gift with thee?—I ask a lay, Soft, fervent, deep, that will not pass away From the still breast; Fill'd with a tone—oh! not for deathless fame, But a sweet haunting murmur of my name, Where it would rest. And Song made answer—“It is not in me, Though call'd immortal; though my gifts may be All but divine. A place of lonely brightness I can give: A changeless one, where thou with Love wouldst live— This is not mine!” Death, Death! wilt thou the restless wish fulfil? And Death, the Strong One, spoke:—“I can but still Each vain regret. What if forgotten?—All thy soul would crave, Thou too, within the mantle of the grave, Wilt soon forget.” Then did my heart in lone faint sadness die, As from all nature's voices one reply, But one—was given. “Earth has no heart, fond dreamer! with a tone To send thee back the spirit of thine own— Seek it in Heaven.” DARTMOOR. A PRIZE POEM. Come, bright Improvement! on the car of Time, And rule the spacious world from clime to clime. Thy handmaid, Art, shall every wild explore, Trace every wave, and culture every shore. Campbell. May ne'er That true succession fail of English hearts, That can perceive, not less than heretofore Our ancestors did feelingly perceive, — the charm Of pious sentiment, diffused afar, And human charity, and social love. Wordsworth. Amidst the peopled and the regal Isle, Whose vales, rejoicing in their beauty, smile; Whose cities, fearless of the spoiler, tower, And send on every breeze a voice of power; Hath Desolation rear'd herself a throne, And mark'd a pathless region for her own? Yes! though thy turf no stain of carnage wore, When bled the noble hearts of many a shore, Though not a hostile step thy heath-flowers bent, When empires totter'd, and the earth was rent; Yet lone, as if some trampler of mankind Had still'd life's busy murmurs on the wind, And, flush'd with power in daring pride's excess, Stamp'd on thy soil the curse of barrenness; For thee in vain descend the dews of heaven, In vain the sunbeam and the shower are given; Wild Dartmoor! thou that, 'midst thy mountains rude, Hast robed thyself with haughty solitude, As a dark cloud on summer's clear blue sky, A mourner, circled with festivity! For all beyond is life!—the rolling sea, The rush, the swell, whose echoes reach not thee. Yet who shall find a scene so wild and bare, But man has left his lingering traces there? E'en on mysterious Afric's boundless plains, Where noon with attributes of midnight reigns, In gloom and silence, fearfully profound, As of a world unwaked to soul or sound. Though the sad wand'rer of the burning zone Feels, as amidst infinity, alone, And nought of life be near; his camel's tread Is o'er the prostrate cities of the dead! Some column, rear'd by long-forgotten hands, Just lifts its head above the billowy sands— Some mouldering shrine still consecrates the scene, And tells that glory's footstep there hath been. There hath the spirit of the mighty pass'd, Not without record; though the desert blast, Borne on the wings of Time, hath swept away The proud creations rear'd to brave decay. But thou, lone region! whose unnoticed name No lofty deeds have mingled with their fame, Who shall unfold thine annals?—who shall tell If on thy soil the sons of heroes fell, In those far ages, which have left no trace, No sunbeam, on the pathway of their race? Though, haply, in the unrecorded days Of kings and chiefs, who pass'd without their praise, Thou might'st have rear'd the valiant and the free; In history's page there is no tale of thee. Yet hast thou thy memorials. On the wild Still rise the cairns of yore, all rudely piled, But hallow'd by that instinct which reveres Things fraught with characters of elder years. And such are these. Long centuries are flown, Bow'd many a crest, and shatter'd many a throne, Mingling the urn, the trophy, and the bust, With what they hide—their shrined and treasured dust; Men traverse Alps and oceans, to behold Earth's glorious works fast mingling with her mould; But still these nameless chronicles of death, 'Midst the deep silence of the unpeopled heath, Stand in primeval artlessness, and wear The same sepulchral mien, and almost share Th' eternity of nature, with the forms Of the crown'd hills beyond, the dwellings of the storms. Yet, what avails it, if each moss-grown heap Still on the waste its lonely vigils keep, Guarding the dust which slumbers well beneath (Nor needs such care) from each cold season's breath? Where is the voice to tell their tale who rest, Thus rudely pillow'd, on the desert's breast? Doth the sword sleep beside them? Hath there been A sound of battle 'midst the silent scene Where now the flocks repose?—did the scythed car Here reap its harvest in the ranks of war? And rise these piles in memory of the slain, And the red combat of the mountain-plain? It may be thus:—the vestiges of strife, Around yet lingering, mark the steps of life, And the rude arrow's barb remains to tell How by its stroke, perchance, the mighty fell To be forgotten. Vain the warrior's pride, The chieftain's power—they had no bard, and died. But other scenes, from their untroubled sphere, The eternal stars of night have witness'd here. There stands an altar of unsculptured stone, Far on the moor, a thing of ages gone, Propp'd on its granite pillars, whence the rains, And pure bright dews, have laved the crimson stains Left by dark rites of blood: for here, of yore, When the bleak waste a robe of forest wore, And many a crested oak, which now lies low, Waved its wild wreath of sacred mistletoe; Here, at dead midnight, through the haunted shade, On Druid-harps the quivering moonbeam play'd, And spells were breath'd, that fill'd the deepening gloom With the pale, shadowy people of the tomb. Or, haply, torches waving through the night, Bade the red cairn-fires blaze from every height, Like battle-signals, whose unearthly gleams Threw o'er the desert's hundred hills and streams, A savage grandeur; while the starry skies Rung with the peal of mystic harmonies, As the loud harp its deep-toned hymns sent forth To the storm-ruling powers, the war-gods of the North. But wilder sounds were there; th' imploring cry That woke the forest's echo in reply, But not the heart's!—Unmoved, the wizard train Stood round their human victim, and in vain His prayer for mercy rose; in vain his glance Look'd up, appealing to the blue expanse, Where, in their calm, immortal beauty, shone Heaven's cloudless orbs. With faint and fainter moan, Bound on the shrine of sacrifice he lay, Till, drop by drop, life's current ebb'd away; Till rock and turf grew deeply, darkly red, And the pale moon gleam'd paler on the dead. Have such things been, and here?—where stillness dwells 'Midst the rude barrows and the moorland swells, Thus undisturb'd?—Oh! long the gulf of time Hath closed in darkness o'er those days of crime, And earth no vestige of their path retains, Save such as these, which strew her loneliest plains With records of man's conflicts and his doom, His spirit and his dust—the altar and the tomb. But ages roll'd away: and England stood, With her proud banner streaming o'er the flood; And with a lofty calmness in her eye, And regal in collected majesty, To breast the storm of battle. Every breeze Bore sounds of triumph o'er her own blue seas; And other lands, redeem'd and joyous, drank The life-blood of her heroes, as they sank On the red fields they won; whose wild flowers wave Now in luxuriant beauty, o'er their grave. 'Twas then the captives of Britannia's war, Here for their lovely southern climes afar In bondage pined: the spell-deluded throng Dragg'd at ambition's chariot-wheels so long To die—because a despot could not clasp A sceptre, fitted to his boundless grasp! Yes! they whose march had rock'd the ancient thrones And temples of the world; the deepening tones Of whose advancing trumpet, from repose Had startled nations, wakening to their woes; Were prisoners here.—And there were some whose dreams Were of sweet homes, by chainless mountain-streams, And of the vine-clad hills, and many a strain, And festal melody of Loire or Seine, And of those mothers who had watch'd and wept, When on the field the unshelter'd conscript slept, Bathed with the midnight dews. And some were there Of sterner spirits, harden'd by despair; Who, in their dark imaginings, again Fired the rich palace and the stately fane, Drank in the victim's shriek, as music's breath, And lived o'er scenes, the festivals of death! And there was mirth, too!—strange and savage mirth, More fearful far than all the woes of earth! The laughter of cold hearts, and scoffs that spring From minds for which there is no sacred thing, And transient bursts of fierce, exulting glee— The lightning's flash upon its blasted tree! But still, howe'er the soul's disguise were worn, If, from wild revelry, or haughty scorn, Or buoyant hope, it won an outward show, Slight was the mask, and all beneath it—woe. Yet, was this all?—amidst the dungeon-gloom, The void, the stillness, of the captive's doom, Were there no deeper thoughts?—And that dark power, To whom guilt owes one late but dreadful hour, The mighty debt through years of crime delay'd, But, as the grave's, inevitably paid; Came he not thither, in his burning force, The lord, the tamer of dark souls—remorse? Yes! as the night calls forth from sea and sky, From breeze and wood, a solemn harmony, Lost, when the swift, triumphant wheels of day, In light and sound, are hurrying on their way: Thus, from the deep recesses of the heart, The voice which sleeps, but never dies, might start, Call'd up by solitude, each nerve to thrill With accents heard not, save when all is still! The voice, inaudible when havoc's train Crush'd the red vintage of devoted Spain; Mute, when sierras to the war-whoop rung, And the broad light of conflagration sprung From the south's marble cities;—hush'd 'midst cries That told the heavens of mortal agonies; But gathering silent strength, to wake at last In concentrated thunders of the past! And there, perchance, some long-bewilder'd mind, Torn from its lowly sphere, its path confined Of village duties, in the Alpine glen, Where nature cast its lot, 'midst peasant-men; Drawn to that vortex, whose fierce ruler blent The earthquake power of each wild element, To lend the tide, which bore his throne on high, One impulse more of desperate energy; Might—when the billow's awful rush was o'er, Which toss'd its wreck upon the storm-beat shore, Won from its wand'rings past, by suffering tried, Search'd by remorse, by anguish purified— Have fix'd, at length, its troubled hopes and fears, On the far world, seen brightest through our tears, And, in that hour of triumph or despair, Whose secrets all must learn—but none declare, When, of the things to come, a deeper sense Fills the dim eye of trembling penitence, Have turn'd to Him whose bow is in the cloud, Around life's limits gathering, as a shroud;— The fearful mysteries of the heart who knows, And, by the tempest, calls it to repose! Who visited that deathbed?—Who can tell Its brief sad tale, on which the soul might dwell, And learn immortal lessons?—who beheld The struggling hope, by shame, by doubt repell'd— The agony of prayer—the bursting tears— The dark remembrances of guilty years, Crowding upon the spirit in their might? He, through the storm who look'd, and there was light! That scene is closed!—that wild, tumultuous breast, With all its pangs and passions, is at rest! He too, is fallen, the master-power of strife, Who woke those passions to delirious life; And days, prepared a brighter course to run, Unfold their buoyant pinions to the sun! It is a glorious hour when Spring goes forth O'er the bleak mountains of the shadowy north, And with one radiant glance, one magic breath, Wakes all things lovely from the sleep of death; While the glad voices of a thousand streams, Bursting their bondage, triumph in her beams! But Peace hath nobler changes! O'er the mind, The warm and living spirit of mankind, Her influence breathes, and bids the blighted heart, To life and hope from desolation start! She, with a look, dissolves the captive's chain, Peopling with beauty widow'd homes again; Around the mother, in her closing years, Gathering her sons once more, and from the tears Of the dim past, but winning purer light, To make the present more serenely bright. Nor rests that influence here. From clime to clime, In silence gliding with the stream of time, Still doth it spread, borne onwards, as a breeze With healing on its wings, o'er isles and seas: And, as Heaven's breath call'd forth, with genial power, From the dry wand, the almond's living flower; So doth its deep-felt charm in secret move The coldest heart to gentle deeds of love; While round its path way nature softly glows, And the wide desert blossoms as the rose. Yes! let the waste lift up the exulting voice! Let the far-echoing solitude rejoice! And thou, lone moor! where no blithe reaper's song E'er lightly sped the Summer-hours along, Bid thy wild rivers, from each mountain-source, Rushing in joy, make music on their course! Thou, whose sole records of existence mark The scene of barbarous rites, in ages dark, And of some nameless combat; hope's bright eye Beams o'er thee in the light of prophecy! Yet shalt thou smile, by busy culture drest, And the rich harvest wave upon thy breast! Yet shall thy cottage smoke, at dewy morn, Rise, in blue wreaths, above the flowering thorn, And, 'midst thy hamlet shades, the embosom'd spire Catch from deep-kindling heavens their earliest fire. Thee too that hour shall bless, the balmy close Of labour's day, the herald of repose, Which gathers hearts in peace; while social mirth Basks in the blaze of each free village hearth; While peasant-songs are on the joyous gales, And merry England's voice floats up from all her vales. Yet are there sweeter sounds; and thou shalt hear Such as to Heaven's immortal host are dear. Oh! if there still be melody on earth, Worthy the sacred bowers where man drew birth, When angel-steps their paths rejoicing trode, And the air trembled with the breath of God; It lives in those soft accents, to the sky Borne from the lips of stainless infancy, When holy strains, from life's pure fount which sprung, Breathed with deep reverence, falter on its tongue. And such shall be thy music, when the cells, Where Guilt, the child of hopeless Misery, dwells, (And, to wild strength by desperation wrought, In silence broods o'er many a fearful thought,) Resound to pity's voice; and childhood thence, Ere the cold blight hath reach'd its innocence, Ere that soft rose-bloom of the soul be fled, Which vice but breathes on and its hues are dead, Shall at the call press forward, to be made A glorious offering, meet for him who said, “Mercy, not sacrifice!” and when, of old, Clouds of rich incense from his altars roll'd, Dispersed the smoke of perfumes, and laid bare The heart's deep folds, to read its homage there! When some crown'd conqueror, o'er a trampled world His banner, shadowing nations, hath unfurl'd, And, like those visitations which deform Nature for centuries, hath made the storm His pathway to dominion's lonely sphere, Silence behind—before him, flight and fear; When kingdoms rock beneath his rushing wheels, Till each fair isle the mighty impulse feels, And earth is moulded but by one proud will, And sceptred realms wear fetters, and are still; Shall the free soul of song bow down to pay, The earthquake homage on its baleful way? Shall the glad harp send up exulting strains, O'er burning cities and forsaken plains? And shall no harmony of softer close Attend the stream of mercy as it flows, And, mingling with the murmur of its wave, Bless the green shores its gentle currents lave? Oh! there are loftier themes, for him whose eyes Have search'd the depths of life's realities, Than the red battle, or the trophied car, Wheeling the monarch-victor fast and far; There are more noble strains than those which swell The triumphs, ruin may suffice to tell! Ye prophet-bards, who sat in elder days Beneath the palms of Judah! Ye whose lays With torrent rapture, from their source on high, Burst in the strength of immortality! Oh! not alone, those haunted groves among, Of conquering hosts, of empires crush'd, ye sung, But of that spirit, destined to explore With the bright day-spring every distant shore, To dry the tear, to bind the broken reed, To make the home of peace in hearts that bleed; With beams of hope to pierce the dungeon's gloom, And pour eternal star-light o'er the tomb. And bless'd and hallow'd be its haunts! for there Hath man's high soul been rescued from despair! There hath the immortal spark for Heaven been nursed; There from the rock the springs of life have burst, Quenchless and pure! and holy thoughts, that rise, Warm from the source of human sympathies— Where'er its path of radiance may be traced, Shall find their temple in the silent waste. WELSH MELODIES. INTRODUCTORY STANZAS. THE HARP OF WALES. INSCRIBED TO THE RUTHIN WELSH LITEBARY SOCIETY. Harp of the mountain-land! sound forth again, As when the foaming Hirlas horn was crown'd, And warrior hearts beat proudly to the strain, And the bright mead at Owain's feast went round: Wake with the spirit and the power of yore! Harp of the ancient hills! be heard once more! Thy tones are not to cease! The Roman came O'er the blue waters with his thousand oars: Through Mona's oaks he sent the wasting flame; The Druid shrines lay prostrate on our shores: All gave their ashes to the wind and sea— Ring out, thou harp! he could not silence thee. Thy tones are not to cease!—The Saxon pass'd, His banners floated on Eryri's gales; But thou wert heard above the trumpet's blast, E'en when his towers rose loftiest o'er the vales! Thine was the voice that cheer'd the brave and free; They had their hills, their chainless hearts, and thee. Those were dark years!—They saw the valiant fall, The rank weeds gathering round the chieftain's board, The hearth left lonely in the ruin'd hall— Yet power was thine—a gift in every chord! Call back that spirit to the days of peace, Thou noble Harp! thy tones are not to cease! DRUID CHORUS ON THE LANDING OF THE ROMANS. By the dread and viewless powers Whom the storms and seas obey, From the Dark Isle's Ynys Dywyll, or the Dark Island, an ancient name for Anglesey. mystic bowers, Romans! o'er the deep away! Think ye, 'tis but nature's gloom O'er our shadowy coast which broods? By the altar and the tomb, Shun these haunted solitudes! Know ye Mona's awful spells? She the rolling orbs can stay! She the mighty grave compels Back to yield its fetter'd prey! Fear ye not the lightning-stroke? Mark ye not the fiery sky? Hence!—around our central oak Gods are gathering—Romans, fly! THE GREEN ISLES OF OCEAN. Where are they, those green fairy islands, reposing In sunlight and beauty, on ocean's calm breast? What spirit, the things which are hidden disclosing, Shall point the bright way to their dwellings of rest? Oh! lovely they rose on the dreams of past ages, The mighty have sought them, undaunted in faith; But the land hath been sad for her warriors and sages, For the guide to those realms of the blessed, is death. Where are they, the high-minded children of glory Who steer'd for those distant green spots on the wave? To the winds of the ocean they left their wild story, In the fields of their country they found not a grave. Perchance they repose where the Summer-breeze gathers, From the flowers of each vale, immortality's breath; But their steps shall be ne'er on the hills of their fathers— For the guide to those realms of the blessed, is death. THE SEA-SONG OF GAFRAN. See note to the “Green Isles of Ocean.” Watch ye well! The moon is shrouded On her bright throne; Storms are gathering, stars are clouded, Waves make wild moan. 'Tis no night of hearth-fires glowing, And gay songs and wine-cups flowing; But of winds, in darkness blowing O'er seas unknown! In the dwellings of our fathers, Round the glad blaze, Now the festive circle gathers, With harps and lays; Now the rush-strewn halls are ringing, Steps are bounding, bards are singing, —Ay! the hour to all is bringing Peace, joy, or praise:— Save to us, our night-watch keeping, Storm-winds to brave, While the very sea-bird sleeping, Rests in its cave! Think of us when hearths are beaming, Think of us when mead is streaming, Ye, of whom our souls are dreaming On the dark wave! THE HIRLAS HORN. Fill high the blue hirlas, Hirlas, from hir, long, and glas, blue or azure. that shines like the wave “Fetch the horn, that we may drink together, whose gloss is like the waves of the sea; whose green handles show the skill of the artist, and are tipped with gold.”—From the Hirlas of Owain Cyfeiliog. When sunbeams are bright on the spray of the sea; And bear thou the rich foaming mead to the brave, The dragons of battle, the sons of the free! To those from whose spears, in the shock of the fight, A beam, like heaven's lightning, “Heard ye in Maelor the noise of war, the horrid din of arms, their furious onset, loud as in the battle of Bangor, where fire flashed out of their spears.”—From the same. flash'd over the field; To those who came rushing as storms in their might, Who have shiver'd the helmet, and cloven the shield; The sound of whose strife was like oceans afar, When lances were red from the harvest of war. Fill high the blue hirlas! O cup-bearer, fill For the lords of the field, in their festival's hour, And let the mead foam, like the stream of the hill, That bursts o'er the rock in the pride of its power: Praise, praise to the mighty, fill high the smooth horn Of honour and mirth, “Fill, then, the yellow-lipped horn—badge of honour and mirth.”—From the same. for the conflict is o'er; And round let the golden-tipp'd hirlas be borne, To the lion-defenders of Gwynedd's fair shore, Who rush'd to the field where the glory was won, As eagles that soar from their cliffs to the sun. Fill higher the hirlas! forgetting not those Who shared its bright draught in the days which are fled! Though cold on their mountains the valiant repose, Their lot shall be lovely—renown to the dead! While harps in the hall of the feast shall be strung, While regal Eryri with snow shall be crown'd— So long by the bards shall their battles be sung, And the heart of the hero shall burn at the sound. The free winds of Maelor Maelor, part of the counties of Denbigh and Flint, according to the modern division. shall swell with their name, And Owain's rich hirlas be fill'd to their fame. THE HALL OF CYNDDYLAN. The Hall of Cynddylan is gloomy to-night; I must weep awhile, and then be silent. Be thou encircled with spreading silence! Ah Death! it will be but a short time he will leave me. Without its lord, without company, without the circling feasts!” See Owen's “Heroic Elegies of Llywarch Hen.” I weep, for the grave has extinguish'd its light; The beam of the lamp from its summit is o'er, The blaze of its hearth shall give welcome no more! The Hall of Cynddylan is voiceless and still, The sound of its harpings hath died on the hill! Be silent for ever, thou desolate scene, Nor let e'en an echo recall what hath been! The Hall of Cynddylan is lonely and bare, No banquet, no guest, not a footstep is there! Oh! where are the warriors who circled its board? —The grass will soon wave where the mead-cup was pour'd! The Hall of Cynddylan is loveless to-night, Since he is departed whose smile made it bright! I mourn; but the sigh of my soul shall be brief, The pathway is short to the grave of my chief! THE LAMENT OF LLYWARCH HEN. The bright hours return, and the blue sky is ringing With song, and the hills are all mantled with bloom; But fairer than aught which the summer is bringing, The beauty and youth gone to people the tomb! Oh! why should I live to hear music resounding, Which cannot awake ye, my lovely, my brave? Why smile the waste flowers, my sad footsteps surrounding? —My sons! they but clothe the green turf of your grave! Alone on the rocks of the stranger I linger, My spirit all wrapt in the past as a dream! Mine ear hath no joy in the voice of the singer, “What I loved when I was a youth is hateful to me now.” Mine eye sparkles not to the sunlight's glad beam; Yet, yet I live on, though forsaken and weeping! —Oh grave! why refuse to the aged thy bed, When valour's high heart on thy bosom is sleeping, When youth's glorious flower is gone down to the dead! Fair were ye, my sons! and all-kingly your bearing, As on to the fields of your glory ye trode! Each prince of my race the bright golden chain wearing, Each eye glancing fire, shrouded now by the sod! “Four and twenty sons to me have been, Wearing the golden chain, and leading princes.” Elegies of Llywarch Hen. The golden chain, as a badge of honour, worn by heroes, is frequently alluded to in the works of the ancient British bards. I weep when the blast of the trumpet is sounding, Which rouses ye not! O, my lovely! my brave! When warriors and chiefs to their proud steeds are bounding, I turn from heaven's light, for it smiles on your grave! “Hardly has the snow covered the vale, When the warriors are hastening to the battle; I do not go, I am hinder'd by infirmity.” Owen's Elegies of Llywarch Hen. GRUFYDD'S FEAST. Let the yellow mead shine for the sons of the brave, By the bright festal torches around us that wave! Set open the gates of the prince's wide hall, And hang up the chief's ruddy spear on the wall! There is peace in the land we have battled to save: Then spread ye the feast, bid the wine-cup foam high, Wine, as well as mead, is frequently mentioned in the poems of the ancient British bards. That those may rejoice who have fear'd not to die! Let the horn, whose loud blast gave the signal for fight, With the bee's sunny nectar now sparkle in light, The horn was used for two purposes, to sound the alarm in war, and to drink the mead at feasts. Let the rich draught it offers with gladness be crown'd, For the strong hearts, in combat that leap'd at its sound! Like the billow's dark swell, was the path of their might, Red, red as their blood, fill the wine-cup on high, That those may rejoice who have fear'd not to die! And wake ye the children of song from their dreams, On Maelor's wild hills, and by Dyfed's fair streams! Maelor, part of the counties of Denbigh and Flint. Dyfed, (said to signify a land abounding with streams of water,) the modern Pembrokeshire. Bid them haste with those strains of the lofty and free, Which shall float down the waves of long ages to be. Sheath the sword which hath given them unperishing themes, And pour the bright mead: let the wine-cup foam high, That those may rejoice who have fear'd not to die! THE CAMBRIAN IN AMERICA. When the last flush of eve is dying On boundless lakes, afar that shine; When winds amidst the palms are sighing, And fragrance breathes from every pine: The aromatic odour of the pine has frequently been mentioned by travellers. When stars through cypress-boughs are gleaming, And fire-flies wander bright and free, Still of thy harps, thy mountains dreaming, My thoughts, wild Cambria! dwell with thee! Alone o'er green savannas roving, Where some broad stream in silence flows, Or through th' eternal forests moving, One only home my spirits knows! Sweet land, whence memory ne'er hath parted! To thee on sleep's light wing I fly; But happier, could the weary-hearted Look on his own blue hills, and die! THE MONARCHY OF BRITAIN. Sons of the Fair Isle! Ynys Prydain, the ancient name of Britain, signifies the Fair or Beautiful Island. forget not the time, Ere spoilers had breath'd the free winds of your clime! All that its eagles behold in their flight, Was yours from the deep to each storm-mantled height! Though from your race that proud birthright be torn, Unquench'd is the spirit for monarchy born. Darkly though clouds may hang o'er us awhile, The crown shall not pass from the Beautiful Isle. Ages may roll ere your children regain The land for which heroes have perish'd in vain. Yet in the sound of your name shall be power, Around her still gathering till glory's full hour. Strong in the fame of the mighty that sleep, Your Britain shall sit on the throne of the deep! Then shall their spirits rejoice in her smile, Who died for the crown of the Beautiful Isle! TALIESIN'S PROPHECY. A voice from time departed yet floats thy hills among, O Cambria! thus thy prophet bard, thy Taliesin sung! The path of unborn ages is traced upon my soul, The clouds which mantle things unseen, away before me roll, A light, the depths revealing, hath o'er my spirit pass'd, A rushing sound from days to be, swells fitful in the blast, And tells me that for ever shall live the lofty tongue, To which the harp of Mona's woods by freedom's hand was strung. Green island of the mighty! Ynys y Cedeirn, or Isle of the Mighty, an ancient name given to Britain. I see thine ancient race Driven from their fathers' realm, to make the rocks their dwelling-place! I see from Uthyr's Uther Pendragon, king of Britain, supposed to have been the father of Arthur. kingdom the sceptre pass away, And many a line of bards, and chiefs, and princely men decay. But long as Arvon's mountains shall lift their sovereign forms, And wear the crown to which is given dominion o'er the storms, So long, their empire sharing, shall live the lofty tongue, To which the harp of Mona's woods by freedom's hand was strung! OWEN GLYNDWR'S WAR SONG. Saw ye the blazing star? The heavens look down on freedom's war, And light her torch on high! Bright on the dragon crest It tells that glory's wing shall rest, When warriors meet to die! Let earth's pale tyrants read despair, And vengeance, in its flame; Hail ye, my bards! the omen fair Of conquest and of fame, And swell the rushing mountain-air With songs to Glyndwr's name. At the dead hour of night, Mark'd ye how each majestic height Burn'd in its awful beams? Red shone th' eternal snows, And all the land, as bright it rose, Was full of glorious dreams! Oh! eagles of the battle! “Bring the horn to Tudwrou, the Eagle of Battles.”— Vide The Hirlas Horn, a poem by Owain Cyfeiliog. The eagle is a very favourite image with the ancient Welsh poets. rise! The hope of Gwynedd wakes! Gwynedd (pronounced Gwyneth), North Wales. It is your banner in the skies, Through each dark cloud which breaks, And mantles, with triumphal dyes, Your thousand hills and lakes! A sound is on the breeze, A murmur, as of swelling seas! The Saxon on his way! Lo! spear, and shield, and lance, From Deva's waves, with lightning glance, Reflected to the day! But who the torrent-wave compels A conqueror's chain to bear? Let those who wake the soul that dwells On our free winds, beware! The greenest and the loveliest dells May be the lion's lair! Of us they told, the seers And monarch-bards of elder years, Who walk'd on earth, as powers! And in their burning strains, A spell of might and mystery reigns, To guard our mountain-towers! —In Snowdon's caves a prophet lay: Merlin, or Merddin Emrys, is said to have composed his prophecies on the future lot of the Britons, amongst the mountains of Snowdon. Many of these, and other ancient prophecies, were applied by Glyndwr to his own cause, and assisted him greatly in animating the spirit of his followers. Before his gifted sight, The march of ages pass'd away With hero-footsteps bright, But proudest in that long array, Was Glyndwr's path of light! PRINCE MADOC'S FAREWELL. Why lingers my gaze where the last hues of day, On the hills of my country, in loveliness sleep? Too fair is the sight for a wand'rer, whose way Lies far o'er the measureless worlds of the deep! Fall, shadows of twilight! and veil the green shore, That the heart of the mighty may waver no more! Why rise on my thoughts, ye free songs of the land Where the harp's lofty soul on each wild wind is borne? Be hush'd, be forgotten! for ne'er shall the hand Of minstrel with melody greet my return. —No! no!—let your echoes still float on the breeze, And my heart shall be strong for the conquest of seas! 'Tis not for the land of my sires, to give birth Unto bosoms that shrink when their trial is nigh; Away! we will bear over ocean and earth A name and a spirit that never shall die. My course to the winds, to the stars, I resign; But my soul's quenchless fire, O my country! is thine. CASWALLON'S TRIUMPH. From the glowing southern regions, Where the sun-god makes his dwelling, Came the Roman's crested legions, O'er the deep, round Britain swelling; The wave grew dazzling as he pass'd, With light from spear and helmet cast, And sounds in every rushing blast Of a conqueror's march were telling. But his eagle's royal pinion, Bowing earth beneath its glory, Could not shadow with dominion Our wild seas and mountains hoary! Back from their cloudy realm it flies, To float in light through softer skies; Oh! chainless winds of heaven arise! Bear a vanquish'd world the story! Lords of earth! to Rome returning, Tell, how Britain combat wages, How Caswallon's soul is burning When the storm of battle rages! And ye that shrine high deeds in song, O holy and immortal throng! The brightness of his name prolong, As a torch to stream through ages! HOWEL'S SONG. Press on, my steed! I hear the swell “I have rode hard, mounted on a fine high-bred steed, upon thy account, O thou with the countenance of cherry-flower bloom. The speed was with eagerness, and the strong long-hamm'd steed of Alban reached the summit of the high land of Brân.” Of Valle Crucis' vesper-bell, Sweet floating from the holy dell O'er woods and waters round. Perchance the maid I love, e'en now, From Dinas Brân's majestic brow, Looks o'er the fairy world below, And listens to the sound! I feel her presence on the scene! The summer air is more serene, The deep woods wave in richer green, The wave more gently flows! O fair as Ocean's curling foam! “My loving heart sinks with grief without thy support, O thou that hast the whiteness of the curling waves! ? I know that this pain will avail me nothing towards obtaining thy love, O thou whose countenance is bright as the flowers of the hawthorn!”—Howel's Ode to Myfanwy. Lo! with the balmy hour I come, The hour that brings the wand'rer home, The weary to repose! Haste! on each mountain's dark'ning crest, The glow hath died, the shadows rest, The twilight-star on Deva's breast, Gleams tremulously bright; Speed for Myfanwy's bower on high! Though scorn may wound me from her eye, Oh! better by the sun to die, Than live in rayless night! THE MOUNTAIN-FIRES. Light the hills! till heaven is glowing As with some red meteor's rays! Winds of night, though rudely glowing, Shall but fan the beacon-blaze. Light the hills till flames are streaming, From Yr Wyddfa, the Welsh name of Snowdon, said to mean the conspicuous place, or object. Yr Wyddfa's sovereign steep, To the waves round Mona gleaming, Where the Roman track'd the deep! Be the mountain watch-fires heighten'd, Pile them to the stormy sky! Till each torrent-wave is brighten'd, Kindling as it rushes by. Now each rock, the mist's high dwelling, Towers in reddening light sublime; Heap the flames! around them telling Tales of Cambria's elder time. Thus our sires, the fearless-hearted, Many a solemn vigil kept, When, in ages long departed, O'er the noble dead they wept. In the winds we hear their voices, —“Sons! though yours a brighter lot, When the mountain-land rejoices, Be her mighty unforgot!” ERYRI WEN. Theirs was no dream, O Monarch-hill, With heaven's own azure crown'd! Who call'd thee—what thou shalt be still, White Snowdon!—holy ground. They fabled not, thy sons, who told Of the dread power, enshrined Within thy cloudy mantle's fold, And on thy rushing wind! It shadow'd o'er thy silent height, It fill'd thy chainless air, Deep thoughts of majesty and might For ever breathing there. Nor hath it fled! the awful spell Yet holds unbroken sway, As when on that wild rock it fell, Where Merddin Emrys lay! Though from their stormy haunts of yore, Thine eagles long have flown, As proud a flight the soul shall soar, Yet from thy mountain-throne! Pierce then the heavens, thou hill of streams! And make the snows thy crest! The sunlight of immortal dreams Around thee still shall rest. Eryri! temple of the bard! And fortress of the free! 'Midst rocks which heroes died to guard, Their spirit dwells with thee! CHANT OF THE BARDS BEFORE THEIR MASSACRE BY EDWARD I. Raise ye the sword! let the death-stroke be given: O! swift may it fall as the lightning of heaven! So shall our spirits be free as our strains: The children of song may not languish in chains! Have ye not trampled our country's bright crest? Are heroes reposing in death on her breast? Red with their blood do her mountain-streams flow, And think ye that still we would linger below? Rest, ye brave dead! 'midst the hills of your sires, O! who would not slumber when freedom expires? Lonely and voiceless your halls must remain— The children of song may not breathe in the chain! THE DYING BARD'S PROPHECY. At the time of the supposed massacre of the Welsh bards by Edward the First. “All is not lost—the unconquerable will And courage never to submit or yield.” Milton. The Hall of Harps is lone to-night, And cold the chieftain's hearth: It hath no mead, it hath no light; No voice of melody, no sound of mirth. The bow lies broken on the floor Whence the free step is gone; The pilgrim turns him from the door Where minstrel-blood hath stain'd the threshold stone. And I, too, go: my wound is deep, My brethren long have died; Yet, ere my soul grow dark with sleep Winds! bear the spoiler one more tone of pride! Bear it where, on his battle plain, Beneath the setting sun, He counts my country's noble slain— Say to him—Saxon, think not all is won. Thou hast laid low the warrior's head, The minstrel's chainless hand; Dreamer! that numberest with the dead The burning spirit of the mountain land! Think'st thou, because the song hath ceased, The soul of song is flown? Think'st thou it woke to crown the feast, It lived beside the ruddy hearth alone? No! by our wrongs, and by our blood, We leave it pure and free; Though hush'd awhile, that sounding flood Shall roll in joy through ages yet to be. We leave it 'midst our country's woe— The birthright of her breast; We leave it as we leave the snow Bright and eternal on Eryri's Eryri, Welsh name for the Snowdon mountains. crest. We leave it with our fame to dwell Upon our children's breath. Our voice in their's through time shall swell— The bard hath gifts of prophecy from death. He dies; but yet the mountains stand, Yet sweeps the torrent's tide; And this is yet Aneurin's Aneurin, one of the noblest of the Welsh bards. land— Winds! bear the spoiler one more tone of pride! THE FAIR ISLE. Ynys Prydain was the ancient Welsh name of Britain, and signifies fair or beautiful isle. (FOR THE MELODY CALLED THE “WELSH GROUND.”) Sons of the Fair Isle! forget not the time, Ere spoilers had breathed the free air of your clime: All that its eagles behold in their flight Was yours, from the deep to each storm-mantled height. Though from your race that proud birthright be torn, Unquench'd is the spirit for monarchy born. CHORUS. Darkly though clouds may hang o'er us awhile, The crown shall not pass from the Beautiful Isle. Ages may roll ere your children regain The land for which heroes have perish'd in vain; Yet, in the sound of your names shall be power, Around her still gathering in glory's full hour. Strong in the fame of the mighty that sleep, Your Britain shall sit on the throne of the deep. CHORUS. Then shall their spirits rejoice in her smile, Who died for the crown of the Beautiful Isle. THE ROCK OF CADER IDRIS. I lay on that rock where the storms have their dwelling, The birthplace of phantoms, the home of the cloud; Around it for ever deep music is swelling, The voice of the mountain-wind, solemn and loud. 'Twas a midnight of shadows all fitfully streaming, Of wild waves and breezes, that mingled their moan; Of dim shrouded stars, as from gulfs faintly gleaming; And I met the dread gloom of its grandeur alone. I lay there in silence—a spirit came o'er me; Man's tongue hath no language to speak what I saw: Things glorious, unearthly, pass'd floating before me, And my heart almost fainted with rapture and awe. I view'd the dread beings, around us that hover, Though veil'd by the mists of mortality's breath; And I call'd upon darkness the vision to cover, For a strife was within me of madness and death. I saw them—the powers of the wind and the ocean, The rush of whose pinion bears onward the storms; Like the sweep of the white-rolling wave was their motion, I felt their dim presence, — but knew not their forms! I saw them—the mighty of ages departed— The dead were around me that night on the hill: From their eyes, as they pass'd, a cold radiance they darted,— There was light on my soul, but my heart's blood was chill. I saw what man looks on, and dies—but my spirit Was strong, and triumphantly lived through that hour; And, as from the grave, I awoke to inherit A flame all immortal, a voice, and a power! Day burst on that rock with the purple cloud crested, And high Cader Idris rejoiced in the sun;— But O! what new glory all nature invested, When the sense which gives soul to her beauty was won! HYMNS FOR CHILDHOOD. INTRODUCTORY VERSES. O! blest art thou whose steps may rove Through the green paths of vale and grove, Or, leaving all their charms below, Climb the wild mountain's airy brow; And gaze afar o'er cultured plains, And cities with their stately fanes, And forests, that beneath thee lie, And ocean mingling with the sky. For man can show thee nought so fair, As Nature's varied marvels there; And if thy pure and artless breast, Can feel their grandeur, thou art blest! For thee the stream in beauty flows, For thee the gale of summer blows; And, in deep glen and wood-walk free, Voices of joy still breathe for thee. But happier far, if then thy soul Can soar to Him who made the whole, If to thine eye the simplest flower Portray His bounty and His power: If, in whate'er is bright or grand, Thy mind can trace His viewless hand, If Nature's music bid thee raise Thy song of gratitude and praise; If heaven and earth, with beauty fraught, Lead to His throne thy raptured thought; If there thou lovest His love to read; Then, wand'rer, thou art blest indeed! THE RAINBOW. “I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.” Genesis, ix. 13. Soft falls the mild reviving shower From April's changeful skies, And rain-drops bend each trembling flower They tinge with richer dies. Soon shall their genial influence call A thousand buds to day, Which, waiting but that balmy fall, In hidden beauty lay. E'en now full many a blossom's bell With fragrance fills the shade; And verdure clothes each grassy dell, In brighter tints array'd. But mark! what arch of varied hue From heaven to earth is bow'd? Haste; ere it vanish, haste to view The Rainbow in the cloud! How bright its glory! there behold The emerald's verdant rays, The topaz blends its hue of gold With the deep ruby's blaze. Yet not alone to charm thy sight Was given the vision fair— Gaze on that arch of colour'd light, And read God's mercy there. It tells us that the mighty deep, Fast by the Eternal chain'd, No more o'er earth's domain shall sweep, Awful and unrestrain'd. It tells that seasons, heat and cold, Fix'd by his sovereign will, Shall, in their course, bid man behold Seed-time and harvest still. That still the flower shall deck the field, When vernal zephyrs blow; That still the vine its fruit shall yield, When autumn sunbeams glow. Then, child of that fair earth! which yet Smiles with each charm endow'd, Bless thou His name, whose mercy set The rainbow in the cloud! THE SUN. The Sun comes forth;—each mountain height Glows with a tinge of rosy light, And flowers, that slumber'd through the night, Their dewy leaves unfold; A flood of splendour bursts on high, And ocean's breast gives back a sky All steep'd in molten gold. Oh! thou art glorious, orb of day; Exulting nations hail thy ray, Creation swells a choral lay, To welcome thy return; From thee all nature draws her hues, Thy beams the insect's wing suffuse, And in the diamond burn. Yet must thou fade;—when earth and heaven By fire and tempest shall be riven, Thou, from thy sphere of radiance driven, Oh Sun! must fall at last; Another heaven, another earth, New power, new glory shall have birth, When all we see is past. But He who gave the word of might, “Let there be light,”—and there was light, Who bade thee chase the gloom of night, And beam the world to bless;— For ever bright, for ever pure, Alone unchanging shall endure The Sun of Righteousness! THE RIVERS. Go! trace th' unnumber'd streams o'er earth That wind their devious course, That draw from Alpine heights their birth, Deep vale, or cavern source. Some by majestic cities glide, Proud scenes of man's renown. Some lead their solitary tide, Where pathless forests frown. Some calmly roll o'er golden sands, Where Afric's deserts lie; Or spread, to clothe rejoicing lands With rich fertility. These bear the bark, whose stately sail Exulting seems to swell; While these, scarce rippled by a gale, Sleep in the lonely dell. Yet on, alike, though swift or slow Their various waves may sweep, Through cities or through shades they flow, To the same boundless deep. Oh! thus, whate'er our path of life, Through sunshine or through gloom, Through scenes of quiet or of strife, Its end is still the tomb. The chief whose mighty deeds we hail, The monarch throned on high, The peasant in his native vale— All journey on—to die! But if Thy guardian care, my God! The pilgrim's course attend, I will not fear the dark abode, To which my footsteps bend. For thence thine all-redeeming Son, Who died the world to save, In light, in triumph, rose, and won The victory from the grave! THE STARS. “The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth his handy-work.” Psalm xix. I. No cloud obscures the summer sky, The moon in brightness walks on high, And, set in azure, every star Shines, a pure gem of heaven, afar! Child of the earth! oh! lift thy glance To yon bright firmament's expanse; The glories of its realm explore, And gaze, and wonder, and adore! Doth it not speak to every sense, The marvels of Omnipotence? Seest thou not there the Almighty name Inscribed in characters of flame? Count o'er those lamps of quenchless light, That sparkle through the shades of night; Behold them!—can a mortal boast To number that celestial host? Mark well each little star, whose rays In distant splendour meet thy gaze: Each is a world, by Him sustain'd Who from eternity hath reign'd. Each, kindled not for earth alone, Hath circling planets of its own, And beings, whose existence springs From Him, the all-powerful King of Kings. Haply, those glorious beings know No stain of guilt, or tear of woe; But, raising still the adoring voice, For ever in their God rejoice. What then art thou, O child of clay! Amid creation's grandeur, say? E'en as an insect on the breeze, E'en as a dew-drop, lost in seas! Yet fear thou not!—the sovereign hand Which spread the ocean and the land, And hung the rolling spheres in air, Hath, e'en for thee, a Father's care! Be thou at peace! the all-seeing eye, Pervading earth, and air, and sky— The searching glance which none may flee, Is still, in mercy, turned on thee. THE OCEAN. “They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters; these see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.” Psalm, cvii. 23, 24. He that in venturous barks hath been A wand'rer on the deep, Can tell of many an awful scene, Where storms for ever sweep. For many a fair, majestic sight Hath met his wand'ring eye, Beneath the streaming northern light, Or blaze of Indian sky. Go! ask him of the whirlpool's roar, Whose echoing thunder peals Loud, as if rush'd along the shore An army's chariot wheels; Of icebergs, floating o'er the main, Or fix'd upon the coast, Like glitt'ring citadel or fane, 'Mid the bright realms of frost; Of coral rocks, from waves below In steep ascent that tower, And fraught with peril, daily grow, Form'd by an insect's power; Of sea-fires, which at dead of night Shine o'er the tides afar, And make the expanse of ocean bright, As heaven, with many a star. O God! thy name they well may praise, Who to the deep go down, And trace the wonders of thy ways, Where rocks and billows frown! If glorious be that awful deep No human power can bind, What then art Thou, who bidd'st it keep Within its bounds confined! Let heaven and earth in praise unite, Eternal praise to Thee, Whose word can rouse the tempest's might, Or still the raging sea! THE THUNDER-STORM. Deep, fiery clouds o'ercast the sky, Dead stillness reigns in air, There is not e'en a breeze, on high The gossamer to bear. The woods are hush'd, the waves at rest, The lake is dark and still, Reflecting on its shadowy breast Each form of rock and hill. The lime-leaf waves not in the grove, The rose-tree in the bower; The birds have ceased their songs of love, Awed by the threatening hour. 'Tis noon;—yet nature's calm profound Seems as at midnight deep; But hark! what peal of awful sound Breaks on creation's sleep? The thunder bursts!—its rolling might Seems the firm hills to shake; And in terrific splendour bright, The gather'd lightnings break. Yet fear not, shrink not thou, my child! Though by the bolt's descent Were the tall cliffs in ruins piled, And the wide forests rent. Doth not thy God behold thee still, With all-surveying eye? Doth not his power all nature fill, Around, beneath, on high? Know, hadst thou eagle-pinions free, To track the realms of air, Thou could'st not reach a spot where He Would not be with thee there! In the wide city's peopled towers, On the vast ocean's plains, 'Midst the deep woodland's loneliest bowers, Alike the Almighty reigns! Then fear not, though the angry sky A thousand darts should cast; Why should we tremble, e'en to die, And be with Him at last? THE BIRDS. “Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings; and not one of them is forgotten before God?” St. Luke, xii. 6. Tribes of the air! whose favour'd race May wander through the realms of space, Free guests of earth and sky; In form, in plumage, and in song, What gifts of nature mark your throng With bright variety! Nor differ less your forms, your flight, Your dwellings hid from hostile sight, And the wild haunts ye love; Birds of the gentle beak! The Italians call all singing birds, birds of the gentle beak. how dear Your wood-note, to the wand'rer's ear, In shadowy vale or grove! Far other scenes, remote, sublime, Where swain or hunter may not climb, The mountain-eagle seeks; Alone he reigns a monarch there, Scarce will the chamois' footstep dare Ascend his Alpine peaks. Others there are, that make their home Where the white billows roar and foam, Around the o'erhanging rock; Fearless they skim the angry wave, Or shelter'd in their sea-beat cave, The tempest's fury mock. Where Afric's burning realm expands, The ostrich haunts the desert sands, Parch'd by the blaze of day; The swan, where northern rivers glide, Through the tall reeds that fringe their tide, Floats graceful on her way. The condor, where the Andes tower, Spreads his broad wing of pride and power, And many a storm defies; Bright in the orient realms of morn, All beauty's richest hues adorn The bird of paradise. Some, amidst India's groves of palm, And spicy forests breathing balm, Weave soft their pendant nest; Some deep in Western wilds, display Their fairy form and plumage gay, In rainbow colours drest. Others no varied song may pour, May boast no eagle-plume to soar, No tints of light may wear; Yet, know, our Heavenly Father guides The least of these, and well provides For each, with tenderest care. Shall He not then thy guardian be? Will not his aid extend to thee? Oh! safely may'st thou rest!— Trust in his love, and e'en should pain, Should sorrow tempt thee to complain, Know what He wills is best! THE SKY-LARK. CHILD'S MORNING HYMN. The Sky-lark, when the dews of morn Hang tremulous on flower and thorn, And violets round his nest exhale Their fragrance on the early gale, To the first sunbeam spreads his wings, Buoyant with joy, and soars and sings. He rests not on the leafy spray, To warble his exulting lay; But high above the morning cloud Mounts in triumphant freedom proud, And swells, when nearest to the sky, His notes of sweetest ecstasy. Thus, my Creator! thus the more My spirit's wing to Thee can soar, The more she triumphs to behold Thy love in all thy works unfold, And bids her hymns of rapture be Most glad, when rising most to Thee! THE NIGHTINGALE. CHILD'S EVENING HYMN. When twilight's grey and pensive hour Brings the low breeze, and shuts the flower, And bids the solitary star Shine in pale beauty from afar. When gathering shades the landscape veil, And peasants seek their village-dale, And mists from river-wave arise, And dew in every blossom lies. When evening's primrose opes to shed Soft fragrance round her grassy bed; When glowworms in the wood-walk light Their lamp, to cheer the traveller's sight; At that calm hour, so still, so pale, Awakes the lonely nightingale; And from a hermitage of shade Fills with her voice the forest-glade; And sweeter far that melting voice, Than all which through the day rejoice; And still shall bard and wand'rer love The twilight music of the grove. Father in heaven! oh! thus when day With all its cares hath pass'd away, And silent hours waft peace on earth, And hush the louder strains of mirth; Thus may sweet songs of praise and prayer To Thee my spirit's offering bear; Yon star, my signal, set on high, For vesper-hymns of piety. So may thy mercy and thy power Protect me through the midnight hour; And balmy sleep and visions blest Smile on thy servant's bed of rest. THE NORTHERN SPRING. When the soft breath of Spring goes forth Far o'er the mountains of the North, How soon those wastes of dazzling snow With life, and bloom, and beauty glow! Then bursts the verdure of the plains, Then break the streams from icy chains; And the glad reindeer seeks no more Amidst deep snows his mossy store. Then the dark pine-wood's boughs are seen Fringed tenderly with living green; And roses, in their brightest dyes, By Lapland's founts and lakes arise. Thus, in a moment, from the gloom And the cold fetters of the tomb, Thus shall the blest Redeemer's voice Call forth his servants to rejoice. For He, whose word is truth, hath said, His power to life shall wake the dead, And summon those he loves on high, To “put on immortality!” Then, all its transient sufferings o'er, On wings of light the soul shall soar, Exulting, to that blest abode, Where tears of sorrow never flow'd. PARAPHRASE OF PSALM CXLVIII. “Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the Lord from the heavens: praise him in the heights.” Praise ye the Lord! on every height Songs to his glory raise! Ye angel-hosts, ye stars of night, Join in immortal praise! Oh! heaven of heavens! let praise far-swelling From all thine orbs be sent! Join in the strain, ye waters, dwelling Above the firmament! For His the word which gave you birth, And majesty, and might; Praise to the Highest from the earth, And let the deeps unite! Oh! fire and vapour, hail and snow! Ye servants of His will! O! stormy winds, that only blow His mandates to fulfil; Mountains and rocks, to heaven that rise; Fair cedars of the wood; Creatures of life that wing the skies, Or track the plains for food; Judges of nations! kings, whose hand Waves the proud sceptre high! O! youths and virgins of the land, O! age and infancy! Praise ye His name, to whom alone All homage should be given; Whose glory, from the eternal throne Spreads wide o'er earth and heaven! MISCELLANEOUS PIECES. I GO, SWEET FRIENDS! I go, sweet friends! yet think of me When spring's young voice awakes the flowers; For we have wander'd far and free In those bright hours, the violet's hours. I go; but when you pause to hear, From distant hills, the Sabbath-bell On summer-winds float silvery clear, Think on me then—I loved it well! Forget me not around your hearth, When cheerly smiles the ruddy blaze, For dear hath been its evening mirth To me, sweet friends, in other days. And oh! when music's voice is heard To melt in strains of parting woe, When hearts to love and grief are stirr'd, Think of me then!—I go, I go! ANGEL VISITS. “No more of talk where God or angel guest With man, as with his friend, familiar used To sit indulgent, and with him partake Rural repast.” Milton. Are ye for ever to your skies departed? Oh! will ye visit this dim world no more? Ye, whose bright wings a solemn splendour darted Through Eden's fresh and flowering shades of yore? Now are the fountains dried on that sweet spot, And ye—our faded earth beholds you not! Yet, by your shining eyes not all forsaken, Man wander'd from his Paradise away; Ye, from forgetfulness his heart to waken, Came down, high guests! in many a later day, And with the patriarchs, under vine or oak, 'Midst noontide calm or hush of evening, spoke. From you, the veil of midnight darkness rending Came the rich mysteries to the sleeper's eye, That saw your hosts ascending and descending On those bright steps between the earth and sky: Trembling he woke, and bow'd o'er glory's trace, And worshipp'd awe-struck, in that fearful place. By Chebar's Ezekiel, chap. x. brook ye pass'd, such radiance wearing As mortal vision might but ill endure; Along the stream the living chariot bearing, With its high crystal arch, intensely pure! And the dread rushing of your wings that hour, Was like the noise of waters in their power. But in the Olive-mount, by night appearing, 'Midst the dim leaves, your holiest work was done! Whose was the voice that came divinely cheering, Fraught with the breath of God, to aid his Son? —Haply of those that, on the moonlit plains, Wafted good tidings unto Syrian swains. Yet one more task was yours! your heavenly dwelling Ye left, and by th' unseal'd sepulchral stone, In glorious raiment, sat; the weepers telling, That He they sought had triumph'd, and was gone! Now have ye left us for the brighter shore, Your presence lights the lonely groves no more. But may ye not, unseen, around us hover, With gentle promptings and sweet influence yet, Though the fresh glory of those days be over, When, 'midst the palm-trees, man your footsteps met? Are ye not near when faith and hope rise high, When love, by strength, o'ermasters agony? Are ye not near when sorrow, unrepining, Yields up life's treasures unto Him who gave? When martyrs, all things for His sake resigning, Lead on the march of death, serenely brave? Dreams!—but a deeper thought our souls may fill— One, One is near—a spirit holier still! IVY SONG. WRITTEN ON RECEIVING SOME IVY-LEAVES GATHERED FROM THE RUINED CASTLE OF RHEINFELS, ON THE RHINE. O! how could Fancy crown with thee In ancient days the God of Wine, And bid thee at the banquet be Companion of the vine? Thy home, wild plant, is where each sound Of revelry hath long been o'er, Where song's full notes once peal'd around, But now are heard no more. The Roman on his battle-plains, Where kings before his eagles bent, Entwined thee with exulting strains Around the victor's tent: Yet there, though fresh in glossy green, Triumphantly thy boughs might wave, Better thou lovest the silent scene Around the victor's grave. Where sleep the sons of ages flown, The bards and heroes of the past; Where, through the halls of glory gone, Murmurs the wintry blast; Where years are hastening to efface Each record of the grand and fair; Thou, in thy solitary grace, Wreath of the tomb! art there. O! many a temple, once sublime, Beneath a blue Italian sky, Hath nought of beauty left by time, Save thy wild tapestry! And, rear'd 'midst crags and clouds, 'tis thine To wave where banners waved of yore, O'er towers that crest the noble Rhine, Along his rocky shore. High from the fields of air look down Those eyries of a vanish'd race— Homes of the mighty, whose renown Hath pass'd, and left no trace. But there thou art!—thy foliage bright Unchanged the mountain storm can brave; Thou, that wilt climb the loftiest height, Or deck the humblest grave! 'Tis still the same! where'er we tread The wrecks of human power we see— The marvels of all ages fled, Left to decay and thee! And still let man his fabrics rear, August in beauty, grace, and strength; Days pass—thou ivy never sere! “Ye myrtles brown, and ivy never sere.” Lycidas.— And all is thine at length! TO ONE OF THE AUTHOR'S CHILDREN ON HIS BIRTHDAY. Where sucks the bee now?—Summer is flying, Leaves round the elm-tree faded are lying; Violets are gone from their grassy dell, With the cowslip cups, where the fairies dwell; The rose from the garden hath pass'd away— Yet happy, fair boy, is thy natal day! For love bids it welcome, the love which hath smiled Ever around thee, my gentle child! Watching thy footsteps, and guarding thy bed, And pouring out joy on thy sunny head. Roses may vanish, but this will stay— Happy and bright is thy natal day! ON A SIMILAR OCCASION. Thou wakest from rosy sleep, to play With bounding heart, my boy! Before thee lies a long bright day Of summer and of joy. Thou hast no heavy thought or dream To cloud thy fearless eye; Long be it thus—life's early stream Should still reflect the sky. Yet, ere the cares of life lie dim On thy young spirit's wings, Now in thy morn forget not Him From whom each pure thought springs! So, in the onward vale of tears, Where'er thy path may be, When strength hath bow'd to evil years, He will remember thee! CHRIST STILLING THE TEMPEST. Fear was within the tossing bark When stormy winds grew loud, And waves came rolling high and dark, And the tall mast was bow'd. And men stood breathless in their dread, And baffled in their skill; But One was there, who rose and said To the wild sea—be still! And the wind ceased—it ceased!—that word Pass'd through the gloomy sky; The troubled billows knew their Lord, And fell beneath His eye. And slumber settled on the deep, And silence on the blast; They sank, as flowers that fold to sleep When sultry day is past. O Thou, that in its wildest hour Didst rule the tempest's mood, Send thy meek spirit forth in power, Soft on our souls to brood! Thou that didst bow the billow's pride Thy mandate to fulfil! Oh, speak to passion's raging tide, Speak, and say, “Peace, be still!” EPITAPH OVER THE GRAVE OF TWO BROTHERS, A CHILD AND A YOUTH. Thou, that canst gaze upon thine own fair boy, And hear his prayer's low murmur at thy knee, And o'er his slumber bend in breathless joy, Come to this tomb! it hath a voice for thee! Pray!—thou art blest—ask strength for sorrow's hour, Love, deep as thine, lays here its broken flower. Thou that art gathering from the smile of youth Thy thousand hopes; rejoicing to behold All the heart's depths before thee bright with truth, All the mind's treasures silently unfold, Look on this tomb!—for thee, too, speaks the grave, Where God hath seal'd the fount of hope he gave. MONUMENTAL INSCRIPTION. Earth! guard what here we lay in holy trust, That which hath left our home a darken'd place, Wanting the form, the smile, now veil'd with dust; The light departed with our loveliest face. Yet from thy bonds our sorrow's hope is free— We have but lent the beautiful to thee. But thou, O Heaven! keep, keep what thou hast taken, And with our treasure keep our hearts on high; The spirit meek, and yet by pain unshaken, The faith, the love, the lofty constancy— Guide us where these are with our sister flown— They were of Thee, and thou hast claim'd thine own! THE SOUND OF THE SEA. Thou art sounding on, thou mighty sea, For ever and the same! The ancient rocks yet ring to thee; Those thunders nought can tame. Oh! many a glorious voice is gone From the rich bowers of earth, And hush'd is many a lovely one Of mournfulness or mirth. The Dorian flute that sigh'd of yore Along the wave, is still; The harp of Judah peals no more On Zion's awful hill. And Memnon's lyre hath lost the chord That breathed the mystic tone; And the songs at Rome's high triumphs pour'd, Are with her eagles flown. And mute the Moorish horn that rang O'er stream and mountain free; And the hymn the leagued Crusaders sang Hath died in Galilee. But thou art swelling on, thou deep, Through many an olden clime, Thy billowy anthem, ne'er to sleep Until the close of time. Thou liftest up thy solemn voice To every wind and sky, And all our earth's green shores rejoice In that one harmony. It fills the noontide's calm profound, The sunset's heaven of gold; And the still midnight hears the sound, Even as first it roll'd. Let there be silence, deep and strange, Where sceptred cities rose! Thou speak'st of One who doth not change— So may our hearts repose. THE CHILD AND DOVE. SUGGESTED BY CHANTREY'S STATUE OF LADY LOUISA RUSSELL. Thou art a thing on our dreams to rise, 'Midst the echoes of long-lost melodies, And to fling bright dew from the morning back, Fair form! on each image of childhood's track. Thou art a thing to recall the hours When the love of our souls was on leaves and flowers; When a world was our own in some dim sweet grove, And treasure untold in one captive dove. Are they gone? can we think it, while thou art there, Thou joyous child with the clustering hair? Is it not spring that indeed breathes free And fresh o'er each thought, while we gaze on thee? No! never more may we smile as thou Sheddest round smiles from thy sunny brow; Yet something it is, in our hearts to shrine A memory of beauty undimm'd as thine. To have met the joy of thy speaking face, To have felt the spell of thy breezy grace, To have linger'd before thee, and turn'd, and borne One vision away of the cloudless morn. A DIRGE. Calm on the bosom of thy God, Young spirit! rest thee now! Even while with us thy footstep trod, His seal was on thy brow. Dust, to its narrow house beneath! Soul, to its place on high!— They that have seen thy look in death, No more may fear to die. Lone are the paths, and sad the bowers, Whence thy meek smile is gone; But oh!—a brighter home than ours, In heaven, is now thine own. SCENE IN A DALECARLIAN MINE. “O! fondly, fervently, those two had loved, Had mingled minds in Love's own perfect trust; Had watch'd bright sunsets, dreamt of blissful years; —And thus they met.” “Haste, with your torches, haste! make firelight round!”— They speed, they press—what hath the miner found? Relic or treasure—giant sword of old? Gems bedded deep—rich veins of burning gold? —Not so—the dead, the dead! An awestruck band, In silence gathering round the silent stand, Chain'd by one feeling, hushing e'en their breath, Before the thing that, in the might of death, Fearful, yet beautiful, amidst them lay— A sleeper, dreaming not!—a youth with hair Making a sunny gleam (how sadly fair!) O'er his cold brow: no shadow of decay Had touch'd those pale bright features—yet he wore A mien of other days, a garb of yore. Who could unfold that mystery? From the throng A woman wildly broke; her eye was dim, As if through many tears, through vigils long, Through weary strainings:—all had been for him! Those two had loved! And there he lay, the dead, In his youth's flower—and she, the living, stood With her grey hair, whence hue and gloss had fled— And wasted form, and cheek, whose flushing blood Had long since ebb'd—a meeting sad and strange! —O! are not meetings in this world of change Sadder than partings oft! She stood there, still, And mute, and gazing—all her soul to fill With the loved face once more—the young, fair face, 'Midst that rude cavern, touch'd with sculpture's grace, By torchlight and by death:—until at last From her deep heart the spirit of the past Gush'd in low broken tones:—“And there thou art! And thus we meet, that loved, and did but part As for a few brief hours!—My friend, my friend! First-love, and only one! Is this the end Of hope deferr'd, youth blighted? Yet thy brow Still wears its own proud beauty, and thy cheek Smiles—how unchanged!—while I, the worn, and weak, And faded—oh! thou wouldst but scorn me now, If thou couldst look on me!—a wither'd leaf, Sear'd—though for thy sake—by the blast of grief! Better to see thee thus! For thou didst go, Bearing my image on thy heart, I know, Unto the dead. My Ulric! through the night How have I call'd thee! With the morning light How have I watch'd for thee!—wept, wander'd, pray'd, Met the fierce mountain-tempest, undismay'd, In search of thee!—bound my worn life to one— One torturing hope! Now let me die! 'Tis gone. Take thy betroth'd!”—And on his breast she fell, —Oh! since their youth's last passionate farewell, How changed in all but love!—the true, the strong, Joining in death whom life had parted long! —They had one grave—one lonely bridal bed, No friend, no kinsman there a tear to shed! His name had ceased—her heart outlived each tie, Once more to look on that dead face, and die! ENGLISH SOLDIER'S SONG OF MEMORY. TO THE AIR OF “AM RHEIN, AM RHEIN!” Sing, sing in memory of the brave departed, Let song and wine be pour'd! Pledge to their fame, the free and fearless-hearted, Our brethren of the sword! Oft at the feast, and in the fight, their voices Have mingled with our own; Fill high the cup, but when the soul rejoices, Forget not who are gone! They that stood with us, 'midst the dead and dying, On Albuera's plain; They that beside us cheerly track'd the flying, Far o'er the hills of Spain; They that amidst us, when the shells were showering From old Rodrigo's wall, The rampart scaled, through clouds of battle towering, First, first at Victory's call! They that upheld the banners, proudly waving, In Roncesvalles' dell; With England's blood the southern vineyards laving, Forget not how they fell! Sing, sing in memory of the brave departed, Let song and wine be pour'd! Pledge to their fame, the free and fearless-hearted, Our brethren of the sword! HAUNTED GROUND. “And slight, withal, may be the things which bring Back on the heart the weight which it would fling Aside for ever—it may be a sound, A tone of music, Summer eve, or Spring, A flower—the wind—the ocean—which shall wound, Striking the electric train, where with we are darkly bound.” Byron. Yes, it is haunted, this quiet scene, Fair as it looks, and all softly green; Yet fear thou not—for the spell is thrown, And the might of the shadow, on me alone. Are thy thoughts wandering to elves and fays, And spirits that dwell where the water plays? Oh! in the heart there are stronger powers, That sway, though viewless, this world of ours! Have I not lived 'midst these lonely dells, And loved, and sorrow'd, and heard farewells, And learn'd in my own deep soul to look, And tremble before that mysterious book? Have I not, under these whispering leaves, Woven such dreams as the young heart weaves? Shadows—yet unto which life seem'd bound; And is it not—is it not haunted ground? Must I not hear what thou hearest not, Troubling the air of the sunny spot? Is there not something to rouse but me, Told by the rustling of every tree? Song hath been here—with its flow of thought, Love—with its passionate visions fraught; Death—breathing stillness and sadness round— And is it not—is it not haunted ground? Are there no phantoms, but such as come By night from the darkness that wraps the tomb?— A sound, a scent, or a whispering breeze, Can summon up mightier far than these! But I may not linger amidst them here! Lovely they are, and yet things to fear; Passing and leaving a weight behind, And a thrill on the chords of the stricken mind. Away, away!—that my soul may soar As a free bird of blue skies once more! Here from its wing it may never cast The chain by those spirits brought back from the past. Doubt it not—smile not—but go thou, too, Look on the scenes where thy childhood grew— Where thou hast pray'd at thy mother's knee, Where thou hast roved with thy brethren free; Go thou, when life unto thee is changed, Friends thou hast loved as thy soul, estranged; When from the idols thy heart hath made, Thou hast seen the colours of glory fade; Oh! painfully then, by the wind's low sigh, By the voice of the stream, by the flower-cup's dye, By a thousand tokens of sight and sound, Thou wilt feel thou art treading on haunted ground. THE CHILD OF THE FORESTS. (WRITTEN AFTER READING THE MEMOIRS OF JOHN HUNTER.) Is not thy heart far off amidst the woods, Where the red Indian lays his father's dust, And, by the rushing of the torrent floods To the Great Spirit, bows in silent trust? Doth not thy soul o'ersweep the foaming main, To pour itself upon the wilds again? They are gone forth, the desert's warrior-race, By stormy lakes to track the elk and roe; But where art thou, the swift one in the chase, With thy free footstep and unfailing bow? Their singing shafts have reach'd the panther's lair, And where art thou?—thine arrows are not there. They rest beside their streams—the spoil is won— They hang their spears upon the cypress bough; The night-fires blaze, the hunter's work is done— They hear the tales of old—but where art thou? The night-fires blaze beneath the giant pine, And there a place is fill'd that once was thine. For thou art mingling with the city's throng, And thou hast thrown thine Indian bow aside; Child of the forests! thou art borne along, E'en as ourselves, by life's tempestuous tide. But will this be? and canst thou here find rest? Thou hadst thy nurture on the desert's breast. Comes not the sound of torrents to thine ear, From the savannah-land, the land of streams? Hear'st thou not murmurs which none else may here? Is not the forest's shadow on thy dreams? They call—wild voices call thee o'er the main, Back to thy free and boundless woods again. Hear them not! hear them not!—thou canst not find In the far wilderness what once was thine! Thou hast quaff'd knowledge from the founts of mind, And gather'd loftier aims and hopes divine. Thou know'st the soaring thought, the immortal strain— Seek not the deserts and the woods again! STANZAS TO THE MEMORY OF ? ? ?. In the full tide of melody and mirth— While joy's bright spirit beams from every eye, Forget not him, whose soul, though fled from earth, Seems yet to speak in strains that cannot die. Forget him not, for many a festal hour, Charm'd by those strains, for us has lightly flown, And memory's visions, mingling with their power, Wake the heart's thrill at each familiar tone. Blest be the harmonist, whose well-known lays Revive life's morning dreams when youth is fled, And, fraught with images of other days, Recall the loved, the absent, and the dead. His the dear art whose spells awhile renew Hope's first illusions in their tenderest bloom— Oh! what were life, without such moments threw Bright gleams, “like angel-visits,” o'er its gloom? THE VAUDOIS VALLEYS. Yes, thou hast met the sun's last smile From the haunted hills of Rome; By many a bright Ægean isle Thou hast seen the billows foam. From the silence of the Pyramid, Thou hast watch'd the solemn flow Of the Nile, that with its waters hid The ancient realm below. Thy heart hath burn'd, as shepherds sung Some wild and warlike strain, Where the Moorish horn once proudly rung Through the pealing hills of Spain. And o'er the lonely Grecian streams Thou hast heard the laurels moan, With a sound yet murmuring in thy dreams Of the glory that is gone. But go thou to the pastoral vales Of the Alpine mountains old, If thou wouldst hear immortal tales By the wind's deep whispers told! Go, if thou lovest the soil to tread Where man hath nobly striven, And life, like incense, hath been shed, An offering unto Heaven. For o'er the snows, and round the pines. Hath swept a noble flood; The nurture of the peasant's vines Hath been the martyr's blood! A spirit, stronger than the sword, And loftier than despair, Through all the heroic region pour'd, Breathes in the generous air. A memory clings to every steep Of long-enduring faith, And the sounding streams glad record keep Of courage unto death. Ask of the peasant where his sires For truth and freedom bled? Ask, where were lit the torturing fires, Where lay the holy dead?— And he will tell thee, all around, On fount, and turf, and stone, Far as the chamois' foot can bound, Their ashes have been sown! Go, when the Sabbath-bell is heard See Gilly's Researches among the Mountains of Piedmont, for an interesting account of a Sabbath-day among the upper regions of the Vaudois. The inhabitants of these Protestant valleys, who, like the Swiss, repair with their flocks and herds to the summit of the hills during the summer, are followed thither by their pastors, and at that season of the year assemble on that sacred day to worship in the open air. Up through the wilds to float, When the dark old woods and caves are stirr'd To gladness by the note. When forth, along their thousand rills, The mountain people come, Join thou their worship on those hills Of glorious martyrdom. And while the song of praise ascends, And while the torrent's voice, Like the swell of many an organ, blends, Then let thy soul rejoice. Rejoice, that human hearts, through scorn, Through shame, through death made strong, Before the rocks and heavens have borne Witness of God so long! SONG OF THE SPANISH WANDERER. Pilgrim! O say, hath thy cheek been fann'd By the sweet winds of my sunny land? Know'st thou the sound of its mountain pines? And hast thou rested beneath its vines? Hast thou heard the music still wandering by, A thing of the breezes, in Spain's blue sky, Floating away o'er hill and heath, With the myrtle's whisper, the citron's breath? Then say, are there fairer vales than those Where the warbling of fountains for ever flows? Are there brighter flowers than mine own, which wave O'er Moorish ruin and Christian grave? O sunshine and song! they are lying far By the streams that look to the western star; My heart is fainting to hear once more The water-voices of that sweet shore. Many were they that have died for thee, And brave, my Spain! though thou art not free; But I call them blest—they have rent their chain— They sleep in thy valleys, my sunny Spain! THE CONTADINA. WRITTEN FOR A PICTURE. Not for the myrtle, and not for the vine, Though its grape, like a gem, be the sunbeam's shrine; And not for the rich blue heaven that showers Joy on thy spirit, like light on the flowers; And not for the scent of the citron trees— Fair peasant! I call thee not blest for these. Not for the beauty spread over thy brow, Though round thee a gleam, as of spring, it throw; And not for the lustre that laughs from thine eye, Like a dark stream's flash to the sunny sky, Though the south in its riches nought lovelier sees— Fair peasant! I call thee not blest for these: But for those breathing and loving things— For the boy's fond arm that around thee clings, For the smiling cheek on thy lap that glows, In the peace of a trusting child's repose— For the hearts whose home is thy gentle breast, Oh! richly I call thee, and deeply blest! TROUBADOUR SONG. The warrior cross'd the ocean's foam For the stormy fields of war; The maid was left in a smiling home And a sunny land afar. His voice was heard where javelin showers Pour'd on the steel-clad line; Her step was 'midst the summer flowers, Her seat beneath the vine. His shield was cleft, his lance was riven, And the red blood stain'd his crest; While she—the gentlest wind of heaven, Might scarcely fan her breast. Yet a thousand arrows pass'd him by, And again he cross'd the seas; But she had died as roses die That perish with a breeze. As roses die, when the blast is come For all things bright and fair— There was death within the smiling home— How had death found her there? THE END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. V. SONGS OF THE CID. The following ballads are not translations from the Spanish, but are founded upon some of the “wild and wonderful” traditions preserved in the romances of that language, and the ancient poem of the Cid. THE CID'S DEPARTURE INTO EXILE. With sixty knights in his gallant train, Went forth the Campeador of Spain; For wild sierras and plains afar, He left the lands of his own Bivar. To march o'er field, and to watch in tent, From his home in good Castile he went; To the wasting siege and the battle's van, —For the noble Cid was a banish'd man! Through his olive-woods the morn-breeze play'd, And his native streams wild music made, And clear in the sunshine his vineyards lay, When for march and combat he took his way. With a thoughtful spirit his way he took, And he turn'd his steed for a parting look, For a parting look at his own fair towers; —Oh! the Exile's heart hath weary hours! The pennons were spread, and the band array'd, But the Cid at the threshold a moment stay'd; It was but a moment—the halls were lone, And the gates of his dwelling all open thrown. There was not a steed in the empty stall, Nor a spear nor a cloak on the naked wall, Nor a hawk on the perch, nor a seat at the door, Nor the sound of a step on the hollow floor. Then a dim tear swell'd to the warrior's eye, As the voice of his native groves went by; And he said—“My foemen their wish have won— Now the will of God be in all things done!” But the trumpet blew, with its note of cheer, And the winds of the morning swept off the tear, And the fields of his glory lay distant far, —He is gone from the towers of his own Bivar! THE CID'S DEATHBED. It was an hour of grief and fear Within Valencia's walls, When the blue Spring-heaven lay still and clear Above her marble halls. There were pale cheeks and troubled eyes, And steps of hurrying feet, Where the Zambra's notes were wont to rise, Along the sunny street. It was an hour of fear and grief, On bright Valencia's shore, For Death was busy with her chief, The noble Campeador. The Moor-king's barks were on the deep, With sounds and signs of war, For the Cid was passing to his sleep, In the silent Alcazar. No moan was heard through the towers of state, No weeper's aspect seen, But by the couch Ximena sate, With pale yet steadfast mien. Stillness was round the leader's bed, Warriors stood mournful nigh, And banners, o'er his glorious head, Were drooping heavily. And feeble grew the conquering hand, And cold the valiant breast; He had fought the battles of the land, And his hour was come to rest. What said the Ruler of the field? —His voice is faint and low; The breeze that creeps o'er his lance and shield Hath louder accents now. “Raise ye no cry, and let no moan Be made when I depart; The Moor must hear no dirge's tone, Be ye of mighty heart! “Let the cymbal-clash and the trumpet-strain From your walls ring far and shrill; And fear ye not, for the saints of Spain Shall grant you victory still. “And gird my form with mail-array, And set me on my steed, So go ye forth on your funeral-way, And God shall give you speed. “Go with the dead in the front of war, All arm'd with sword and helm, And march by the camp of King Bucar, For the good Castilian realm. “And let me slumber in the soil Which gave my fathers birth; I have closed my day of battle-toil, And my course is done on earth.” —Now wave, ye glorious banners, wave! Through the lattice a wind sweeps by, And the arms, o'er the deathbed of the brave, Send forth a hollow sigh. Now wave, ye banners of many a fight! As the fresh wind o'er you sweeps; The wind and the banners fall hush'd as night, The Campeador—he sleeps! Sound the battle-horn on the breeze of morn, And swell out the trumpet's blast, Till the notes prevail o'er the voice of wail, For the noble Cid hath pass'd! THE CID'S FUNERAL PROCESSION. The Moor had beleaguer'd Valencia's towers, And lances gleam'd up through her citron-bowers, And the tents of the desert had girt her plain, And camels were trampling the vines of Spain; For the Cid was gone to rest. There were men from wilds where the death-wind sweeps, There were spears from hills where the lion sleeps, There were bows from sands where the ostrich runs, For the shrill horn of Afric had call'd her sons To the battles of the West. The midnight bell, o'er the dim seas heard, Like the roar of waters, the air had stirr'd; The stars were shining o'er tower and wave, And the camp lay hush'd as a wizard's cave; But the Christians woke that night. They rear'd the Cid on his barbed steed, Like a warrior mail'd for the hour of need, And they fix'd the sword in the cold right hand, Which had fought so well for his father's land, And the shield from his neok hung bright. There was arming heard in Valencia's halls, There was vigil kept on the rampart walls; Stars had not faded nor clouds turn'd red, When the knights had girded the noble dead, And the burial train moved out. With a measured pace, as the pace of one, Was the still death-march of the host begun; With a silent step went the cuirass'd bands, Like a lion's tread on the burning sands, And they gave no battle-shout. When the first went forth, it was midnight deep, In heaven was the moon, in the camp was sleep, When the last through the city's gates had gone, O'er tent and rampart the bright day shone, With a sun-burst from the sea. There were knights five hundred went arm'd before, And Bermudez the Cid's green standard bore; To its last fair field, with the break of morn, Was the glorious banner in silence borne, On the glad wind streaming free. And the Campeador came stately then, Like a leader circled with steel-clad men! The helmet was down o'er the face of the dead, But his steed went proud, by a warrior led, For he knew that the Cid was there. He was there, the Cid, with his own good sword, And Ximena following her noble lord; Her eye was solemn, her step was slow, But there rose not a sound of war or woe, Not a whisper on the air. The halls in Valencia were still and lone, The churches were empty, the masses done; There was not a voice through the wide streets far, Nor a foot-fall heard in the Alcazar, —So the burial-train moved out. With a measured pace, as the pace of one, Was the still death-march of the host begun; With a silent step went the cuirass'd bands, Like a lion's tread on the burning sands; —And they gave no battle-shout. But the deep hills peal'd with a cry ere long, When the Christians burst on the Paynim throng! —With a sudden flash of the lance and spear, And a charge of the war-steed in full career, It was Alvar Fañez came! He that was wrapt with no funeral shroud, Had pass'd before, like a threatening cloud! And the storm rush'd down on the tented plain, And the Archer-Queen, with her bands lay slain, For the Cid upheld his fame. Then a terror fell on the King Bucar, And the Lybian kings who had join'd his war; And their hearts grew heavy, and died away, And their hands could not yield an assagay, For the dreadful things they saw! For it seem'd where Minaya his onset made, There were seventy thousand knights array'd, All white as the snow on Nevada's steep, And they came like the foam of a roaring deep; —'Twas a sight of fear and awe! And the crested form of a warrior tall, With a sword of fire, went before them all; With a sword of fire, and a banner pale, And a blood-red cross on his shadowy mail, He rode in the battle's van! There was fear in the path of his dim white horse, There was death in the giant-warrior's course! Where his banner stream'd with its ghostly light, Where his sword blazed out, there was hurrying flight, For it seem'd not the sword of man! The field and the river grew darkly red, As the kings and leaders of Afric fled; There was work for the men of the Cid that day! —They were weary at eve, when they ceased to slay, As reapers whose task is done! The kings and the leaders of Afric fled! The sails of their galleys in haste were spread; But the sea had its share of the Paynim-slain, And the bow of the desert was broke in Spain; —So the Cid to his grave pass'd on! THE CID'S RISING. 'Twas the deep mid-watch of the silent night, And Leon in slumber lay, When a sound went forth in rushing might, Like an army on its way! In the stillness of the hour, When the dreams of sleep have power, And men forget the day. Through the dark and lonely streets it went, Till the slumberers woke in dread;— The sound of a passing armament, With the charger's stony tread. There was heard no trumpet's peal, But the heavy tramp of steel, As a host's to combat led. Through the dark and lonely streets it pass'd, And the hollow pavement rang, And the towers, as with a sweeping blast, Rock'd to the stormy clang! But the march of the viewless train Went on to a royal fane, Where a priest his night-hymn sang. There was knocking that shook the marble floor, And a voice at the gate, which said— “That the Cid Ruy Diez, the Campeador, Was there in his arms array'd; And that with him, from the tomb, Had the Count Gonzalez come With a host, uprisen to aid! “And they came for the buried king that lay At rest in that ancient fane; For he must be arm'd on the battle-day, With them, to deliver Spain!” —Then the march went sounding on, And the Moors, by noontide sun, Were dust on Tolosa's plain. ON A FLOWER FROM THE FIELD OF GRÜTLI. Whence art thou, flower? from holy ground, Where freedom's foot hath been! Yet bugle-blast or trumpet sound Ne'er shook that solemn scene. Flower of a noble field! thy birth Was not where spears have cross'd, And shiver'd helms have strewn the earth, 'Midst banners won and lost. But where the sunny hues and showers Unto thy cup were given, There met high hearts at midnight hours, Pure hands were raised to heaven. And vows were pledged that man should roam Through every Alpine dell, Free as the wind, the torrent's foam, The shaft of William Tell. And prayer, the full deep flow of prayer, Hallow'd the pastoral sod, And souls grew strong for battle there, Nerved with the peace of God. Before the Alps and stars they knelt, That calm devoted band, And rose, and made their spirits felt Through all the mountain land. Then welcome Grütli's free-born flower! Even in thy pale decay There dwells a breath, a tone, a power, Which all high thoughts obey. ON A LEAF FROM THE TOMB OF VIRGIL. And was thy home, pale wither'd thing, Beneath the rich blue southern sky? Wert thou a nursling of the spring, The winds and suns of glorious Italy? Those suns in golden light e'en now, Look o'er the poet's lovely grave, Those winds are breathing soft, but thou Answering their whisper, there no more shalt wave. The flowers, o'er Posilippo's brow, May cluster in their purple bloom, But on th' o'ershadowing ilex-bough, Thy breezy place is void by Virgil's tomb. Thy place is void; oh! none on earth, This crowded earth, may so remain, Save that which souls of loftiest birth Leave when they part, their brighter home to gain. Another leaf, ere now, hath sprung On the green stem which once was thine; When shall another strain be sung Like his whose dust hath made that spot a shrine? THE CHIEFTAIN'S SON. Yes, it is ours!—the field is won, A dark and evil field! Lift from the ground my noble son, And bear him homewards on his bloody shield! Let me not hear your trumpets ring, Swell not the battle-horn! Thoughts far too sad those notes will bring, When to the grave my glorious flower is borne! Speak not of victory!—in the name There is too much of woe! Hush'd be the empty voice of Fame— Call me back his whose graceful head is low. Speak not of victory!—from my halls The sunny hour is gone! The ancient banner on my walls, Must sink erelong—I had but him—but one! Within the dwelling of my sires The hearths will soon be cold, With me must die the beacon-fires That stream'd at midnight from the mountain-hold. And let them fade, since this must be, My lovely and my brave! Was thy bright blood pour'd forth for me, And is there but for stately youth a grave? Speak to me once again, my boy! Wilt thou not hear my call? Thou wert so full of life and joy, I had not dreamt of this—that thou couldst fall! Thy mother watches from the steep For thy returning plume; How shall I tell her that thy sleep Is of the silent house, th' untimely tomb? Thou didst not seem as one to die, With all thy young renown! —Ye saw his falchion's flash on high, In the mid-fight, when spears and crests went down! Slow be your march! the field is won! A dark and evil field! Lift from the ground my noble son, And bear him homewards on his bloody shield. A FRAGMENT. Rest on your battle-fields, ye brave! Let the pines murmur o'er your grave, Your dirge be in the moaning wave— We call you back no more! Oh! there was mourning when ye fell, In your own vales a deep-toned knell, An agony, a wild farewell;— But that hath long been o'er. Rest with your still and solemn fame; The hills keep record of your name, And never can a touch of shame Darken the buried brow. But we on changeful days are cast, When bright names from their place fall fast; And ye that with your glory past, We cannot mourn you now. ENGLAND'S DEAD. Son of the ocean isle! Where sleep your mighty dead? Show me what high and stately pile Is rear'd o'er Glory's bed. Go, stranger! track the deep, Free, free the white sail spread! Wave may not foam, nor wild wind sweep, Where rest not England's dead. On Egypt's burning plains, By the pyramid o'ersway'd, With fearful power the noonday reigns, And the palm-trees yield no shade. But let the angry sun From heaven look fiercely red, Unfelt by those whose task is done!— There slumber England's dead. The hurricane hath might Along the Indian shore, And far by Ganges' banks at night, Is heard the tiger's roar. But let the sound roll on! It hath no tone of dread, For those that from their toils are gone;— There slumber England's dead. Loud rush the torrent-floods The western wilds among, And free, in green Columbia's woods, The hunter's bow is strung. But let the floods rush on! Let the arrow's flight be sped! Why should they reck whose task is done?— There slumber England's dead! The mountain-storms rise high In the snowy Pyrenees, And toss the pine-boughs through the sky, Like rose-leaves on the breeze. But let the storm rage on! Let the fresh wreaths be shed! For the Roncesvalles' field is won,— There slumber England's dead. On the frozen deep's repose 'Tis a dark and dreadful hour, When round the ship the ice-fields close, And the northern night-clouds lower. But let the ice drift on! Let the cold-blue desert spread! Their course with mast and flag is done,— Even there sleep England's dead. The warlike of the isles, The men of field and wave! Are not the rocks their funeral piles, The seas and shores their grave? Go, stranger! track the deep, Free, free the white sail spread! Wave may not foam, nor wild wind sweep, Where rest not England's dead. THE MEETING OF THE BARDS. WRITTEN FOR AN EISTEDDVOD, OR MEETING OF WELSH BARDS, HELD IN LONDON, MAY 22, 1822. Where met our bards of old?—the glorious throng, They of the mountain and the battle song? They met—oh! not in kingly hall or bower, But where wild nature girt herself with power: They met—where streams flash'd bright from rocky caves, They met—where woods made moan o'er warriors' graves, And where the torrent's rainbow spray was cast, And where dark lakes were heaving to the blast, And, 'midst th' eternal cliffs, whose strength defied The crested Roman, in his hour of pride; And where the Carnedd, Carnedd, a stone-barrow, or cairn. on its lonely hill, Bore silent record of the mighty still; And where the Druid's ancient Cromlech Cromlech, a Druidical monument or altar. The word means a stone of covenant. frown'd, And the oaks breathed mysterious murmurs round. There throng'd th' inspired of yore!—on plain or height, In the sun's face, beneath the eye of light, And, baring unto heaven each noble head, Stood in the circle, where none else might tread. Well might their lays be lofty!—soaring thought From Nature's presence tenfold grandeur caught: Well might bold freedom's soul pervade the strains, Which startled eagles from their lone domains, And, like a breeze in chainless triumph, went Up through the blue resounding firmament. Whence came the echoes to those numbers high? 'Twas from the battle fields of days gone by, And from the tombs of heroes, laid to rest With their good swords, upon the mountain's breast; And from the watch-towers on the heights of snow, Sever'd by cloud and storm from all below; And the turf-mounds, The ancient British chiefs frequently harangued their followers from small artificial mounts of turf.—See Pennant. once girt by ruddy spears, And the rock-altars of departed years. Thence, deeply mingling with the torrent's roar, The winds a thousand wild responses bore; And the green land, whose every vale and glen Doth shrine the memory of heroic men, On all her hills awakening to rejoice, Sent forth proud answers to her children's voice. For us, not ours the festival to hold, 'Midst the stone-circles, hallow'd thus of old; Not where great nature's majesty and might First broke, all-glorious, on our infant sight; Not near the tombs, where sleep our free and brave, Not by the mountain-llyn, Llyn, a lake or pool. the ocean wave, In these late days we meet—dark Mona's shore, Eryri's Eryri, Snowdon. cliffs resound with harps no more! But, as the stream (though time or art may turn The current, bursting from its cavern'd urn, To bathe soft vales of pasture and of flowers, From Alpine glens, or ancient forest bowers) Alike, in rushing strength, or sunny sleep, Holds on its course, to mingle with the deep; Thus, though our paths be changed, still warm and free, Land of the bard! our spirit flies to thee! To thee our thoughts, our hopes, our hearts belong, Our dreams are haunted by thy voice of song! Nor yield our souls one patriot-feeling less, To the green memory of thy loveliness, Than theirs, whose harp-notes peal'd from every height, In the sun's face, beneath the eye of light! THE VOICE OF SPRING. Originally published in the New Monthly Magazine. I come, I come! ye have call'd me long, I come o'er the mountains with light and song! Ye may trace my step o'er the wakening earth, By the winds which tell of the violet's birth, By the primrose-stars in the shadowy grass, By the green leaves, opening as I pass. I have breathed on the south, and the chestnut flowers By thousands have burst from the forest-bowers, And the ancient graves, and the fallen fanes, Are veil'd with wreaths on Italian plains;— But it is not for me, in my hour of bloom, To speak of the ruin or the tomb! I have look'd o'er the hills of the stormy north, And the larch has hung all his tassels forth, The fisher is out on the sunny sea, And the reindeer bounds o'er the pastures free, And the pine has a fringe of softer green, And the moss looks bright, where my foot hath been. I have sent through the wood-paths a glowing sigh, And call'd out each voice of the deep blue sky; From the night-bird's lay through the starry time, In the groves of the soft Hesperian clime, To the swan's wild note, by the Iceland lakes, When the dark fir-branch into verdure breaks. From the streams and founts I have loosed the chain, They are sweeping on to the silvery main, They are flashing down from the mountain brows, They are flinging spray o'er the forest-boughs, They are bursting fresh from their sparry caves, And the earth resounds with the joy of waves! Come forth, O ye children of gladness, come! Where the violets lie may be now your home. Ye of the rose lip and dew-bright eye, And the bounding footstep, to meet me fly! With the lyre, and the wreath, and the joyous lay, Come forth to the sunshine, I may not stay. Away from the dwellings of care-worn men, The waters are sparkling in grove and glen! Away from the chamber and sullen hearth, The young leaves are dancing in breezy mirth! Their light stems thrill to the wild-wood strains, And youth is abroad in my green domains. But ye!—ye are changed since ye met me last! There is something bright from your features pass'd! There is that come over your brow and eye, Which speaks of a world where the flowers must die! —Ye smile! but your smile hath a dimness yet— Oh! what have you look'd on since last we met? Ye are changed, ye are changed!—and I see not here All whom I saw in the vanish'd year! There were graceful heads, with their ringlets bright, Which toss'd in the breeze with a play of light, There were eyes, in whose glistening laughter lay No faint remembrance of dull decay! There were steps that flew o'er the cowslip's head, As if for a banquet all earth were spread; There were voices that rung through the sapphire sky, And had not a sound of mortality! Are they gone? is their mirth from the mountains pass'd?— Ye have look'd on death since ye met me last! I know whence the shadow comes o'er you now, Ye have strewn the dust on the sunny brow! Ye have given the lovely to earth's embrace— She hath taken the fairest of beauty's race, With their laughing eyes and their festal crown, They are gone from amongst you in silence down! They are gone from amongst you, the young and fair, Ye have lost the gleam of their shining hair!— But I know of a land where there falls no blight, I shall find them there, with their eyes of light! Where Death 'midst the blooms of the morn may dwell, I tarry no longer—farewell, farewell! The summer is coming, on soft winds borne, Ye may press the grape, ye may bind the corn! For me, I depart to a brighter shore, Ye are mark'd by care, ye are mine no more; I go where the loved who have left you dwell, And the flowers are not Death's—fare ye well, farewell! RECORDS OF WOMAN. ARABELLA STUART. “And is not love in vain, Torture enough without a living tomb?” Byron. “Fermossi al fin il cor che balzò tanto.” Pindemonte. I. 'Twas but a dream!—I saw the stag leap free, Under the boughs where early birds were singing, I stood o'ershadow'd by the greenwood tree, And heard, it seem'd, a sudden bugle ringing Far through a royal forest: then the fawn Shot, like a gleam of light, from grassy lawn To secret covert; and the smooth turf shook And lilies quiver'd by the glade's lone brook, And young leaves trembled, as, in fleet career, A princely band, with horn, and hound, and spear, Like a rich masque swept forth. I saw the dance Of their white plumes, that bore a silvery glance Into the deep wood's heart; and all pass'd by Save one—I met the smile of one clear eye, Flashing out joy to mine. Yes, thou wert there. Seymour! a soft wind blew the clustering hair Back from thy gallant brow, as thou didst rein Thy courser, turning from that gorgeous train, And fling, methought, thy hunting spear away, And, lightly graceful in thy green array, Bound to my side; and we, that met and parted, Ever in dread of some dark watchful power, Won back to childhood's trust, and fearless-hearted, Blent the glad fulness of our thoughts that hour, Even like the mingling of sweet streams, beneath Dim woven leaves, and 'midst the floating breath Of hidden forest-flowers. II. 'Tis past!—I wake, A captive, and alone, and far from thee, My love and friend! Yet fostering, for thy sake, A quenchless hope of happiness to be; And feeling still my woman-spirit strong, In the deep faith which lifts from earthly wrong A heaven ward glance. I know, I know our love Shall yet call gentle angels from above, By its undying fervour, and prevail— Sending a breath, as of the Spring's first gale, Through hearts now cold; and, raising its bright face, With a free gush of sunny tears, erase The characters of anguish: in this trust, I bear, I strive, I bow not to the dust, That I may bring thee back no faded form, No bosom chill'd and blighted by the storm, But all my youth's first treasures, when we meet, Making past sorrow, by communion, sweet. III. And thou too art in bonds!—yet droop thou not, O my beloved—there is one hopeless lot, But one, and that not ours. Beside the dead There sits the grief that mantles up its head, Loathing the laughter and proud pomp of light, When darkness, from the vainly doting sight Covers its beautiful! If thou wert gone To the grave's bosom, with thy radiant brow— If thy deep-thrilling voice, with that low tone Of earnest tenderness, which now, even now Seems floating through my soul, were music taken For ever from this world—oh! thus forsaken, Could I bear on?—thou livest, thou livest, thou'rt mine! With this glad thought I make my heart a shrine, And by the lamp which quenchless there shall burn, Sit a lone watcher for the day's return. IV. And lo! the joy that cometh with the morning, Brightly victorious o'er the hours of care! I have not watch'd in vain, serenely scorning The wild and busy whispers of despair! Thou hast sent tidings, as of heaven—I wait The hour, the sign, for blessed flight to thee. Oh! for the skylark's wing that seeks its mate As a star shoots!—but on the breezy sea We shall meet soon. To think of such an hour! Will not my heart, o'erburden'd by its bliss, Faint and give way within me, as a flower Borne down and perishing by noontide's kiss? Yet shall I fear that lot—the perfect rest, The full deep joy of dying on thy breast, After long suffering won? So rich a close Too seldom crowns with peace affection's woes. V. Sunset!—I tell each moment—from the skies The last red splendour floats along my wall, Like a king's banner!—Now it melts, it dies! I see one star—I hear—'twas not the call, Th' expected voice; my quick heart throbb'd too soon. I must keep vigil till yon rising moon Shower down less golden light. Beneath her beam Through my lone lattice pour'd, I sit and dream Of summer-lands afar, where holy love, Under the vine or in the citron grove, May breathe from terror. Now the night grows deep, And silent as its clouds, and full of sleep. I hear my veins beat.—Hark! a bell's slow chime! My heart strikes with it.—Yet again—'tis time! A step!—a voice!—or but a rising breeze? Hark!—haste!—I come, to meet thee on the seas. VI. Now never more, oh! never, in the worth Of its pure cause, let sorrowing love on earth Trust fondly—never more!—the hope is crush'd That lit my life, the voice within me hush'd That spoke sweet oracles; and I return To lay my youth, as in a burial urn, Where sunshine may not find it. All is lost! No tempest met our barks—no billow toss'd; Yet were they sever'd, even as we must be, That so have loved, so striven our hearts to free From their close-coiling fate! In vain—in vain! The dark links meet, and clasp themselves again, And press out life. Upon the deck I stood, And a white sail came gliding o'er the flood, Like some proud bird of ocean; then mine eye Strain'd out, one moment earlier to descry The form it ached for, and the bark's career Seem'd slow to that fond yearning: it drew near, Fraught with our foes! What boots it to recall The strife, the tears? Once more a prison wall Shuts the green hills and woodlands from my sight, And joyous glance of waters to the light, And thee, my Seymour, thee! I will not sink! Thou, thou hast rent the heavy chain that bound thee! And this shall be my strength—the joy to think That thou may'st wander with heaven's breath around thee, And all the laughing sky! This thought shall yet Shine o'er my heart a radiant amulet, Guarding it from despair. Thy bonds are broken, And unto me, I know, thy true love's token Shall one day be deliverance, though the years Lie dim between, o'erhung with mists of tears. VII. My friend! my friend! where art thou? Day by day Gliding, like some dark mournful stream, away! My silent youth flows from me. Spring, the while, Comes and rains beauty on the kindling boughs Round hall and hamlet; Summer with her smile, Fills the green forest; young hearts breathe their vows; Brothers long parted meet; fair children rise Round the glad board; Hope laughs from loving eyes: All this is in the world!—These joys lie sown, The dew of every path. On one alone Their freshness may not fall—the stricken deer Dying of thirst with all the waters near. VIII. Ye are from dingle and fresh glade, ye flowers! By some kind hand to cheer my dungeon sent; O'er you the oak shed down the summer showers, And the lark's nest was where your bright cups bent, Quivering to breeze and raindrop, like the sheen Of twilight stars. On you heaven's eye hath been, Through the leaves, pouring its dark sultry blue Into your glowing hearts; the bee to you Hath murmur'd, and the rill.—My soul grows faint With passionate yearning, as its quick dreams paint Your haunts by dell and stream—the green, the free, The full of all sweet sound—the shut from me! IX. There went a swift bird singing past my cell— O Love and Freedom! ye are lovely things! With you the peasant on the hills may dwell, And by the streams; but I—the blood of kings, A proud unmingling river, through my veins Flows in lone brightness, and its gifts are chains! Kings!—I had silent visions of deep bliss, Leaving their thrones far distant, and for this I am cast under their triumphal car, An insect to be crush'd!—Oh! Heaven is far— Earth pitiless! Dost thou forget me, Seymour? I am proved So long, so sternly! Seymour, my beloved! There are such tales of holy marvels done By strong affection, of deliverance won Through its prevailing power! Are these things told Till the young weep with rapture, and the old Wonder, yet dare not doubt; and thou! oh, thou! Dost thou forget me in my hope's decay?— Thou canst not!—through the silent night, even now, I, that need prayer so much, awake and pray Still first for thee.—Oh, gentle, gentle friend! How shall I bear this anguish to the end? Aid!—comes there yet no aid?—the voice of blood Passes heaven's gate, even ere the crimson flood Sinks through the greensward!—is there not a cry From the wrung heart, of power, through agony, To pierce the clouds? Hear, Mercy!—hear me! None That bleed and weep beneath the smiling sun Have heavier cause!—yet hear!—my soul grows dark— Who hears the last shriek from the sinking bark On the mid seas, and with the storm alone, And bearing to the abyss, unseen, unknown, Its freight of human hearts?—th' o'ermastering wave! Who shall tell how it rush'd—and none to save. Thou hast forsaken me! I feel, I know, There would be rescue if this were not so. Thou'rt at the chase, thou'rt at the festive board, Thou'rt where the red wine free and high is pour'd, Thou'rt where the dancers meet!—a magic glass Is set within my soul, and proud shapes pass, Flushing it o'er with pomp from bower and hall; I see one shadow, stateliest there of all— Thine!—What dost thou amidst the bright and fair, Whispering light words, and mocking my despair? It is not well of thee!—my love was more Than fiery song may breathe, deep thought explore; And there thou smilest, while my heart is dying, With all its blighted hopes around it lying; Even thou, on whom they hung their last green leaf— Yet smile, smile on! too bright art thou for grief! Death!—what? is death a lock'd and treasured thing, Guarded by swords of fire? a hidden spring, A fabled fruit, that I should thus endure, As if the world within me held no cure? Wherefore not spread free wings—Heaven, Heaven control These thoughts—they rush—I look into my soul As down a gulf, and tremble at the array Of fierce forms crowding it! Give strength to pray, So shall their dark host pass. The storm is still'd. Father in Heaven! thou, only thou, canst sound The heart's great deep, with floods of anguish fill'd, For human line too fearfully profound. Therefore, forgive, my Father! if thy child, Rock'd on its heaving darkness, hath grown wild And sinn'd in her despair! It well may be, That thou wouldst lead my spirit back to thee— By the crush'd hope too long on this world pour'd, The stricken love which hath perchance adored A mortal in thy place! Now let me strive With thy strong arm no more! Forgive, forgive! Take me to peace! And peace at last is nigh. A sign is on my brow, a token sent Th' o'erwearied dust from home: no breeze flits by, But calls me with a strange sweet whisper, blent Of many mysteries. Hark! the warning tone Deepens—its word is Death! Alone, alone, And sad in youth, but chasten'd, I depart, Bowing to heaven. Yet, yet my woman's heart Shall wake a spirit and a power to bless, Even in this hour's o'ershadowing fearfulness, Thee, its first love!—oh! tender still, and true! Be it forgotten if mine anguish threw Drops from its bitter fountain on thy name, Though but a moment. Now, with fainting frame, With soul just lingering on the flight begun, To bind for thee its last dim thoughts in one, I bless thee! Peace be on thy noble head, Years of bright fame, when I am with the dead! I bid this prayer survive me, and retain Its might, again to bless thee, and again! Thou hast been gather'd into my dark fate Too much; too long, for my sake, desolate Hath been thine exiled youth; but now take back, From dying hands, thy freedom, and retrack (After a few kind tears for her whose days Went out in dreams of thee) the sunny ways Of hope, and find thou happiness! Yet send, Even then, in silent hours, a thought, dear friend! Down to my voiceless chamber; for thy love Hath been to me all gifts of earth above, Though bought with burning tears! It is the sting Of death to leave that vainly-precious thing In this cold world! What were it then, if thou, With thy fond eyes, wert gazing on me now? Too keen a pang!—Farewell! and yet once more, Farewell!—the passion of long years I pour Into that word: thou hear'st not—but the woe And fervour of its tones may one day flow To thy heart's holy place; there let them dwell— We shall o'ersweep the grave to meet—Farewell! THE BRIDE OF THE GREEK ISLE. Founded on a circumstance related in the Second Series of the Curiosities of Literature, and forming part of a picture in the “Painted Biography” there described. “Fear!—I'm a Greek, and how should I fear death? A slave, and wherefore should I dread my freedom? I will not live degraded.” Sardanapalus. I. Come from the woods with the citron-flowers, Come with your lyres for the festal hours, Maids of bright Scio! They came, and the breeze Bore their sweet songs o'er the Grecian seas;— They came, and Eudora stood robed and crown'd, The bride of the morn, with her train around. Jewels flash'd out from her braided hair, Like starry dews 'midst the roses there; Pearls on her bosom quivering shone, Heaved by her heart through its golden zone; But a brow, as those gems of the ocean pale, Gleam'd from beneath her transparent veil; Changeful and faint was her fair cheek's hue, Though clear as a flower which the light looks through; And the glance of her dark resplendent eye, For the aspect of woman at times too high, Lay floating in mists, which the troubled stream Of the soul sent up o'er its fervid beam. She look'd on the vine at her father's door, Like one that is leaving his native shore; She hung o'er the myrtle once call'd her own, As it greenly waved by the threshold stone; She turn'd—and her mother's gaze brought back Each hue of her childhood's faded track. Oh! hush the song, and let her tears Flow to the dream of her early years! Holy and pure are the drops that fall When the young bride goes from her father's hall; She goes unto love yet untried and new, She parts from love which hath still been true; Mute be the song and the choral strain, Till her heart's deep well-spring is clear again! She wept on her mother's faithful breast, Like a babe that sobs itself to rest; She wept—yet laid her hand awhile In his that waited her dawning smile— Her soul's affianced, nor cherish'd less For the gush of nature's tenderness! She lifted her graceful head at last— The choking swell of her heart was past; And her lovely thoughts from their cells found way In the sudden flow of a plaintive lay. THE BRIDE'S FAREWELL. Why do I weep?—to leave the vine Whose clusters o'er me bend; The myrtle—yet, oh! call it mine!— The flowers I loved to tend. A thousand thoughts of all things dear, Like shadows o'er me sweep, I leave my sunny childhood here, Oh, therefore let me weep! I leave thee, sister! we have play'd Through many a joyous hour, Where the silvery green of the olive shade Hung dim o'er fount and bower. Yes, thou and I, by stream, by shore, In song, in prayer, in sleep, Have been as we may be no more— Kind sister, let me weep! I leave thee, father! Eve's bright moon Must now light other feet, With the gather'd grapes, and the lyre in tune, Thy homeward step to greet. Thou, in whose voice, to bless thy child, Lay tones of love so deep, Whose eye o'er all my youth hath smiled— I leave thee! let me weep! Mother! I leave thee! on thy breast, Pouring out joy and wo; I have found that holy place of rest Still changeless—yet I go! Lips, that have lull'd me with your strain, Eyes that have watch'd my sleep! Will earth give love like yours again! Sweet mother! let me weep! And like a slight young tree, that throws The weight of rain from its drooping boughs, Once more she wept. But a changeful thing Is the human heart, as a mountain spring That works its way, through the torrent's foam, To the bright pool near it, the lily's home! It is well!—the cloud on her soul that lay, Hath melted in glittering drops away. Wake again, mingle, sweet flute and lyre! She turns to her lover, she leaves her sire. Mother! on earth it must still be so, Thou rearest the lovely to see them go! They are moving onward, the bridal throng, Ye may track their way by the swells of song; Ye may catch through the foliage their white robes' gleam, Like a swan 'midst the reeds of a shadowy stream. Their arms bear up garlands, their gliding tread Is over the deep-vein'd violet's bed; They have light leaves around them, blue skies above, An arch for the triumph of youth and love! II. Still and sweet was the home that stood In the flowering depths of a Grecian wood, With the soft green light o'er its low roof spread, As if from the glow of an emerald shed, Pouring through lime-leaves that mingled on high, Asleep in the silence of noon's clear sky. Citrons amidst their dark foliage glow'd, Making a gleam round the lone abode; Laurels o'erhung it, whose faintest shiver Scatter'd out rays like a glancing river; Stars of the jasmine its pillars crown'd, Vine-stalks its lattice and walls had bound; And brightly before it a fountain's play Flung showers through a thicket of glossy bay, To a cypress which rose in that flashing rain, Like one tall shaft of some fallen fane. And thither Ianthis had brought his bride, And the guests were met by that fountain-side; They lifted the veil from Eudora's face, It smiled out softly in pensive grace, With lips of love, and a brow serene, Meet for the soul of the deep wood-scene.— Bring wine, bring odours!—the board is spread.— Bring roses! a chaplet for every head! The wine-cups foam'd, and the rose was shower'd On the young and fair from the world embower'd; The sun look'd not on them in that sweet shade, The winds amid scented boughs were laid; And there came by fits, through some wavy tree, A sound and a gleam of the moaning sea. Hush! be still!—was that no more Than the murmur from the shore? Silence!—did thick rain-drops beat On the grass like trampling feet?— Fling down the goblet, and draw the sword! The groves are fill'd with a pirate horde! Through the dim olives their sabres shine!— Now must the red blood stream for wine! The youths from the banquet to battle sprang, The woods with the shriek of the maidens rang; Under the golden-fruited boughs There were flashing poniards and dark'ning brows— Footsteps, o'er garland and lyre that fled, And the dying soon on a greensward bed. —Eudora, Eudora! thou dost not fly!— She saw but Ianthis before her lie, With the blood from his breast in a gushing flow, Like a child's large tears in its hour of woe, And a gathering film in his lifted eye, That sought his young bride out mournfully.— She knelt down beside him, her arms she wound Like tendrils, his drooping neck around, As if the passion of that fond grasp Might chain in life with its ivy-clasp. But they tore her thence in her wild despair, The sea's fierce rovers—they left him there; They left to the fountain a dark-red vein, And on the wet violets a pile of slain, And a hush of fear through the summer grove— So closed the triumph of youth and love! III. Gloomy lay the shore that night, When the moon, with sleeping light, Bathed each purple Sciote hill— Gloomy lay the shore, and still. O'er the wave no gay guitar Sent its floating music far; No glad sound of dancing feet Woke the starry hours to greet. But a voice of mortal woe, In its changes wild or low, Through the midnight's blue repose, From the sea-beat rocks arose, As Eudora's mother stood Gazing o'er th' Ægean flood, With a fix'd and straining eye— Oh! was the spoilers' vessel nigh? Yes! there, becalm'd in silent sleep, Dark and alone on a breathless deep, On a sea of molten silver, dark Brooding it frown'd that evil bark! There its broad pennon a shadow cast, Moveless and black from the tall still mast; And the heavy sound of its flapping sail Idly and vainly woo'd the gale. Hush'd was all else:—Had ocean's breast Rock'd e'en Eudora that hour to rest? To rest?—the waves tremble!—what piercing cry Bursts from the heart of the ship on high? What light through the heavens, in a sudden spire, Shoots from the deck up? Fire! 'tis fire! There are wild forms hurrying to and fro, Seen darkly clear on that lurid glow; There are shout, and signal-gun, and call, And the dashing of water—but fruitless all! Man may not fetter, nor ocean tame The might and wrath of the rushing flame! It hath twined the mast like a glittering snake, That coils up a tree from a dusky brake; It hath touch'd the sails, and their canvass rolls Away from its breath into shrivell'd scrolls; It hath taken the flag's high place in the air, And redden'd the stars with its wavy glare; And sent out bright arrows, and soar'd in glee, To a burning mount 'midst the moonlight sea. The swimmers are plunging from stern and prow— Eudora! Eudora! where, where art thou? The slave and his master alike are gone.— Mother! who stands on the deck alone? The child of thy bosom!—and lo! a brand Blazing up high in her lifted hand! And her veil flung back, and her free dark hair Sway'd by the flames as they rock and flare; And her fragile form to its loftiest height Dilated, as if by the spirit's might; And her eye with an eagle-gladness fraught— Oh! could this work be of woman wrought? Yes! 'twas her deed!—by that haughty smile It was hers—she hath kindled her funeral pile! Never might shame on that bright head be, Her blood was the Greek's, and hath made her free! Proudly she stands, like an Indian bride, On the pyre with the holy dead beside; But a shriek from her mother hath caught her ear, As the flames to her marriage robe draw near, And starting, she spreads her pale arms in vain To the form they must never infold again. —One moment more, and her hands are clasp'd— Fallen is the torch they had wildly grasp'd— Her sinking knee unto Heaven is bow'd, And her last look raised through the smoke's dim shroud, And her lips as in prayer for her pardon move;— Now the night gathers o'er youth and love! THE SWITZER'S WIFE. “Nor look nor tone revealeth aught Save woman's quietness of thought; And yet around her is a light Of inward majesty and might.” M.J.J. “Wer solch ein Herz an seinen Busen drückt, Der kann für Herd und Hof mit Freuden fechten.” Willhelm Tell. It was the time when children bound to meet Their father's homeward step from field or hill, And when the herd's returning bells are sweet In the Swiss valleys, and the lakes grow still, And the last note of that wild horn swells by, Which haunts the exile's heart with melody. And lovely smiled full many an Alpine home, Touch'd with the crimson of the dying hour, Which lit its low roof by the torrent's foam, And pierced its lattice through the vine-hung bower; But one, the loveliest o'er the land that rose, Then first look'd mournful in its green repose. For Werner sat beneath the linden tree, That sent its lulling whispers through his door, Even as man sits, whose heart alone would be With some deep care, and thus can find no more Th' accustom'd joy in all which evening brings, Gathering a household with her quiet wings. His wife stood hush'd before him—sad, yet mild In her beseeching mien;—he mark'd it not. The silvery laughter of his bright-hair'd child Rang from the greensward round the shelter'd spot, But seem'd unheard; until at last the boy Raised from his heap'd up flowers a glance of joy, And met his father's face; but then a change Pass'd swiftly o'er the brow of infant glee, And a quick sense of something dimly strange Brought him from play to stand beside the knee So often climb'd, and lift his loving eyes That shone through clouds of sorrowful surprise. Then the proud bosom of the strong man shook; But tenderly his babe's fair mother laid Her hand on his, and with a pleading look Through tears half-quivering, o'er him bent and said, “What grief, dear friend, hath made thy heart its prey, That thou shouldst turn thee from our love away? “It is too sad to see thee thus, my friend! Mark'st thou the wonder on thy boy's fair brow, Missing the smile from thine? Oh, cheer thee! bend To his soft arms, unseal thy thoughts e'en now! Thou dost not kindly to withhold the share Of tried affection in thy secret care.” He look'd up into that sweet earnest face, But sternly, mournfully: not yet the band Was loosen'd from his soul; its inmost place Not yet unveil'd by love's o'ermastering hand. “Speak low!” he cried, and pointed where on high The white Alps glitter'd through the solemn sky: “We must speak low amidst our ancient hills And their free torrents; for the days are come When tyranny lies couch'd by forest-rills, And meets the shepherd in his mountain-home. Go, pour the wine of our own grapes in fear— Keep silence by the hearth! its foes are near. “The envy of th' oppressor's eye hath been Upon my heritage. I sit to-night Under my household tree, if not serene, Yet with the faces best beloved in sight: To-morrow eve may find me chain'd, and thee— How can I bear the boy's young smiles to see?” The bright blood left that youthful mother's cheek; Back on the linden stem she lean'd her form, And her lip trembled as it strove to speak, Like a frail harp-string shaken by the storm. 'Twas but a moment, and the faintness pass'd, And the free Alpine spirit woke at last. And she, that ever through her home had moved With the meek thoughtfulness and quiet smile Of woman, calmly loving and beloved, And timid in her happiness the while, Stood brightly forth, and steadfastly, that hour, Her clear glance kindling into sudden power. Ay, pale she stood, but with an eye of light, And took her fair child to her holy breast, And lifted her soft voice, that gather'd might As it found language:—“Are we thus oppress'd? Then must we rise upon our mountain-sod, And man must arm, and woman call on God! “I know what thou wouldst do;—and be it done! Thy soul is darken'd with its fears for me. Trust me to Heaven, my husband! this, thy son, The babe whom I have born thee, must be free! And the sweet memory of our pleasant hearth May well give strength—if aught be strong on earth. “Thou hast been brooding o'er the silent dread Of my desponding tears; now, lift once more, My hunter of the hills! thy stately head, And let thine eagle glance my joy restore! I can bear all, but seeing thee subdued— Take to thee back thine own undaunted mood. “Go forth beside the waters, and along The chamois paths, and through the forests go; And tell, in burning words, thy tale of wrong To the brave hearts that 'midst the hamlets glow. God shall be with thee, my beloved!—Away! Bless but thy child, and leave me:—I can pray!” He sprang up, like a warrior youth awaking To clarion sounds upon the ringing air; He caught her to his breast, while proud tears breaking From his dark eyes fell o'er her braided hair; And “worthy art thou,” was his joyous cry, “That man for thee should gird himself to die. “My bride, my wife, the mother of my child! Now shall thy name be armour to my heart: And this our land, by chains no more defiled, Be taught of thee to choose the better part! I go—thy spirit on my words shall dwell, Thy gentle voice shall stir the Alps:—Farewell!” And thus they parted, by the quiet lake, In the clear starlight: he the strength to rouse Of the free hills; she, thoughtful for his sake, To rock her child beneath the whispering boughs, Singing its blue half-curtain'd eyes to sleep, With a low hymn, amidst the stillness deep. PROPERZIA ROSSI. Tell me no more, no more Of my soul's lofty gifts! Are they not vain To quench its haunting thirst for happiness? Have I not loved, and striven, and fail'd to bind One true heart unto me, whereon my own Might find a resting-place, a home for all Its burden of affections? I depart, Unknown, though Fame goes with me; I must leave The earth unknown. Yet it may be that death Shall give my name a power to win such tears As would have made life precious. I. One dream of passion and of beauty more! And in its bright fulfilment let me pour My soul away! Let earth retain a trace Of that which lit my being, though its race Might have been loftier far. Yet one more dream! From my deep spirit one victorious gleam Ere I depart! For thee alone, for thee! May this last work, this farewell triumph be— Thou, loved so vainly! I would leave enshrined Something immortal of my heart and mind, That yet may speak to thee when I am gone, Shaking thine inmost bosom with a tone Of lost affection;—something that may prove What she hath been, whose melancholy love On thee was lavish'd; silent pang and tear, And fervent song, that gush'd when none were near, And dream by night, and weary thought by day, Stealing the brightness from her life away— While thou—A wake! not yet within me die! Under the burden and the agony Of this vain tenderness—my spirit, wake! Even for thy sorrowful affection's sake, Live! in thy work breathe out!—that he may yet, Feeling sad mastery there, perchance regret Thine unrequited gift. II. It comes—the power Within me born flows back—my fruitless dower That could not win me love. Yet once again I greet it proudly, with its rushing train Of glorious images:—they throng—they press— A sudden joy lights up my loneliness— I shall not perish all! The bright work grows Beneath my hand, unfolding, as a rose, Leaf after leaf, to beauty; line by line, I fix my thought, heart, soul, to burn, to shine, Through the pale marble's veins. It grows!—and now I give my own life's history to thy brow, Forsaken Ariadne! thou shalt wear My form, my lineaments; but oh! more fair, Touch'd into lovelier being by the glow Which in me dwells, as by the summer light All things are glorified. From thee my woe Shall yet look beautiful to meet his sight, When I am pass'd away. Thou art the mould, Wherein I pour the fervent thoughts, th' untold, The self-consuming! Speak to him of me, Thou, the deserted by the lonely sea, With the soft sadness of thine earnest eye— Speak to him, lorn one! deeply, mournfully, Of all my love and grief! Oh! could I throw Into thy frame a voice, a sweet, and low, And thrilling voice of song! when he came nigh, To send the passion of its melody Through his pierced bosom—on its tones to bear My life's deep feeling, as the southern air Wafts the faint myrtle's breath—to rise, to swell, To sink away in accents of farewell, Winning but one, one gush of tears, whose flow Surely my parted spirit yet might know, If love be strong as death! III. Now fair thou art, Thou form, whose life is of my burning heart Yet all the vision that within me wrought, I cannot make thee! Oh! I might have given Birth to creations of far nobler thought; I might have kindled, with the fire of heaven, Things not of such as die! But I have been Too much alone;—a heart whereon to lean, With all these deep affections that o'erflow My aching soul and find no shore below; An eye to be my star; a voice to bring Hope o'er my path like sounds that breathe of spring: These are denied me—dreamt of still in vain— Therefore my brief aspirings from the chain, Are ever but as some wild fitful song, Rising triumphantly, to die erelong In dirge-like echoes. IV. Yet the world will see Little of this, my parting work, in thee— Thou shalt have fame!—Oh, mockery! give the reed From storms a shelter—give the drooping vine Something round which its tendrils may entwine— Give the parch'd flower a rain-drop, and the meed Of love's kind words to woman! Worthless fame! That in his bosom wins not for my name Th' abiding place it ask'd! Yet how my heart, In its own fairy world of song and art, Once beat for praise! Are those high longings o'er? That which I have been can I be no more? Never! oh, never more! though still thy sky Be blue as then, my glorious Italy! And though the music, whose rich breathings fill Thine air with soul, be wandering past me still; And though the mantle of thy sunlight streams, Unchanged on forms, instinct with poet-dreams: Never! oh, never more! Where'er I move, The shadow of this broken-hearted love Is on me and around! Too well they know, Whose life is all within, too soon and well, When there the blight hath settled!—but I go Under the silent wings of peace to dwell; From the slow wasting, from the lonely pain, The inward burning of those words—“in vain,” Sear'd on the heart—I go. 'Twill soon be past, Sunshine, and song, and bright Italian heaven, And thou, Oh! thou, on whom my spirit cast Unvalued wealth—who know'st not what was given In that devotedness—the sad, and deep, And unrepaid—farewell! If I could weep Once, only once, beloved one! on thy breast, Pouring my heart forth ere I sink to rest! But that were happiness, and unto me Earth's gift is fame. Yet I was form'd to be So richly bless'd! With thee to watch the sky, Speaking not, feeling but that thou wert nigh: With thee to listen, while the tones of song Swept even as part of our sweet air along— To listen silently: with thee to gaze On forms, the deified of olden days— This had been joy enough; and hour by hour, From its glad well-springs drinking life and power, How had my spirit soar'd, and made its fame A glory for thy brow! Dreams, dreams!—the fire Burns faint within me. Yet I leave my name— As a deep thrill may linger on the lyre When its full chords are hush'd—awhile to live, And one day haply in thy heart revive Sad thoughts of me:—I leave it, with a sound, A spell o'er memory, mournfully profound— I leave it, on my country's air to dwell— Say proudly yet—“'Twas hers who loved me well!” GERTRUDE; OR, FIDELITY TILL DEATH. “Dark lowers our fate, And terrible the storm that gathers o'er as; But nothing, till that latest agony Which severs thee from nature, shall unloose This fix'd and sacred hold. In thy dark prison-house, In the terrific face of armed law, Yea, on the scaffold, if it needs must be, I never will forsake thee.” Joanna Baillie. Her hands were clasp'd, her dark eyes raised, The breeze threw back her hair; Up to the fearful wheel she gazed— All that she loved was there. The night was round her clear and cold, The holy heaven above, Its pale stars watching to behold The might of earthly love. “And bid me not depart,” she cried, “My Rudolph say not so! This is no time to quit thy side— Peace! peace! I cannot go. Hath the world aught for me to fear, When death is on thy brow? The world! what means it?—mine is here— I will not leave thee now. “I have been with thee in thine hour Of glory and of bliss; Doubt not its memory's living power To strengthen me through this! And thou, mine honour'd love and true, Bear on, bear nobly on! We have the blessed heaven in view, Whose rest shall soon be won.” And were not these high words to flow From woman's breaking heart? Through all that night of bitterest woe She bore her lofty part; But oh! with such a glazing eye, With such a curdling cheek— Love, love of mortal agony, Thou, only thou, should'st speak! The wind rose high—but with it rose Her voice, that he might hear: Perchance that dark hour brought repose To happy bosoms near; While she sat striving with despair Beside his tortured form, And pouring her deep soul in prayer Forth on the rushing storm. She wiped the death-damps from his brow With her pale hands and soft, Whose touch upon the lute-chords low Had still'd his heart so oft. She spread her mantle o'er his breast, She bathed his lips with dew, And on his cheek such kisses press'd As hope and joy ne'er knew. Oh! lovely are ye, Love and Faith, Enduring to the last! She had her meed—one smile in death— And his worn spirit pass'd. While even as o'er a martyr's grave She knelt on that sad spot, And, weeping, bless'd the God who gave Strength to forsake it not! IMELDA. “Sometimes The young forgot the lessons they had learnt, And loved when they should hate—like thee, Imelda!” Italy, a Poem. “Passa la bella Donna, e par che dorma.” Tasso. We have the myrtle's breath around us here, Amidst the fallen pillars;—this hath been Some Naiad's fane of old. How brightly clear, Flinging a vein of silver o'er the scene, Up through the shadowy grass, the fountain wells, And music with it, gushing from beneath The ivy'd altar!—that sweet murmur tells The rich wild-flowers no tale of woe or death; Yet once the wave was darken'd, and a stain Lay deep, and heavy drops—but not of rain— On the dim violets by its marble bed, And the pale shining water-lily's head. Sad is that legend's truth.—A fair girl met One whom she loved, by this lone temple's spring, Just as the sun behind the pine-grove set, And eve's low voice in whispers woke, to bring All wanderers home. They stood, that gentle pair With the blue heaven of Italy above, And citron-odours dying on the air, And light leaves trembling round, and early love Deep in each breast. What reck'd their souls of strife Between their fathers? Unto them young life Spread out the treasures of its vernal years; And if they wept, they wept far other tears Than the cold world brings forth. They stood, that hour, Speaking of hope, while tree, and fount, and flower, And star, just gleaming through the cypress boughs, Seem'd holy things, as records of their vows. But change came o'er the scene. A hurrying tread Broke on the whispery shades. Imelda knew The footstep of her brother's wrath, and fled Up where the cedars make yon avenue Dim with green twilight: pausing there, she caught— Was it the clash of swords?—a swift dark thought Struck down her lip's rich crimson as it pass'd, And from her eye the sunny sparkle took One moment with its fearfulness, and shook Her slight frame fiercely, as a stormy blast Might rock the rose. Once more, and yet once more, She still'd her heart to listen—all was o'er; Sweet summer winds alone were heard to sigh, Bearing the nightingale's deep spirit by. That night Imelda's voice was in the song, Lovely it floated through the festive throng Peopling her father's halls. That fatal night Her eye look'd starry in its dazzling light, And her cheek glow'd with beauty's flushing dyes, Like a rich cloud of eve in southern skies— A burning, ruby cloud. There were, whose gaze Follow'd her form beneath the clear lamp's blaze, And marvell'd at its radiance. But a few Beheld the brightness of that feverish hue With something of dim fear; and in that glance Found strange and sudden tokens of unrest, Startling to meet amidst the mazy dance, Where thought, if present, an unbidden guest, Comes not unmask'd. Howe'er this were, the time Sped as it speeds with joy, and grief, and crime Alike: and when the banquet's hall was left Unto its garlands of their bloom bereft, When trembling stars look'd silvery in their wane, And heavy flowers yet slumber'd, once again There stole a footstep, fleet, and light, and lone, Through the dim cedar shade—the step of one That started at a leaf, of one that fled, Of one that panted with some secret dread: What did Imelda there? She sought the scene Where love so late with youth and hope had been; Bodings were on her soul—a shuddering thrill Ran through each vein, when first the Naiad's rill Met her with melody—sweet sounds and low; We hear them yet, they live along its flow— Her voice is music lost! The fountain-side She gain'd—the wave flash'd forth—'twas darkly dyed Even as from warrior-hearts; and on its edge, Amidst the fern, and flowers, and moss-tufts deep, There lay, as lull'd by stream and rustling sedge, A youth, a graceful youth.—“Oh! dost thou sleep? Azzo!” she cried, “my Azzo! is this rest? But then her low tones falter'd:—“On thy breast Is the stain—yes, 'tis blood!—and that cold cheek— That moveless lip!—thou dost not slumber?—speak, Speak, Azzo, my beloved—no sound—no breath— What hath come thus between our spirits?—Death! Death?—I but dream—I dream!—” and there she stood, A faint fair trembler, gazing first on blood, With her fair arm around yon cypress thrown, Her form sustain'd by that dark stem alone, And fading fast, like spell-struck maid of old, Into white waves dissolving, clear and cold; When from the grass her dimm'd eye caught a gleam— 'Twas where a sword lay shiver'd by the stream— Her brother's sword!—she knew it; and she knew 'Twas with a venom'd point that weapon slew! Woe for young love! But love is strong. There came Strength upon woman's fragile heart and frame, There came swift courage! On the dewy ground She knelt, with all her dark hair floating round Like a long silken stole; she knelt, and press'd Her lips of glowing life to Azzo's breast, Drawing the poison forth. A strange, sad sight! Pale death, and fearless love, and solemn night! So the moon saw them last. The morn came singing Through the green forests of the Apenines, With all her joyous birds their free flight winging, And steps and voices out amongst the vines. What found that dayspring here? Two fair forms laid Like sculptured sleepers; from the myrtle shade Casting a gleam of beauty o'er the wave, Still, mournful, sweet. Were such things for the grave? Could it be so indeed? That radiant girl, Deck'd as for bridal hours!—long braids of pearl Amidst her shadowy locks were faintly shining, As tears might shine, with melancholy light; And there was gold her slender waist entwining; And her pale graceful arms—how sadly bright! And fiery gems upon her breast were lying, And round her marble brow red roses dying. But she died first!—the violet's hue had spread O'er her sweet eyelids with repose oppress'd; She had bow'd heavily her gentle head, And on the youth's hush'd bosom sunk to rest. So slept they well!—the poison's work was done Love with true heart had striven—but Death had won. EDITH. A TALE OF THE WOODS. Founded on incidents related in an American work, Sketches of Connecticut. “Du Heilige! rufe dein Kind zurück! Ich habe genossen das irdische Glück, Ich habe gelebt und geliebet.” Wallenstein. The woods—oh! solemn are the boundless woods Of the great western world when day declines, And louder sounds the roll of distant floods, More deep the rustling of the ancient pines; When dimness gathers on the stilly air, And mystery seems o'er every leaf to brood, Awful it is for human heart to bear The might and burden of the solitude! Yet, in that hour, 'midst those green wastes, there sate One young and fair; and oh! how desolate! But undismay'd: while sank the crimson light, And the high cedars darken'd with the night, Alone she sate: though many lay around, They, pale and silent on the bloody ground, Were sever'd from her need and from her woe, Far as Death severs Life. O'er that wild spot Combat had raged, and brought the valiant low, And left them, with the history of their lot, Unto the forest oaks:—a fearful scene For her whose home of other days had been 'Midst the fair halls of England! But the love Which fill'd her soul was strong to cast out fear; And by its might upborne all else above, She shrank not—mark'd not that the dead were near. Of him alone she thought, whose languid head Faintly upon her wedded bosom fell; Memory of aught but him on earth was fled, While heavily she felt his life-blood well Fast o'er her garments forth, and vainly bound With her torn robe and hair the streaming wound— Yet hoped, still hoped! Oh! from such hope how long Affection woos the whispers that deceive, Even when the pressure of dismay grows strong! And we, that weep, watch, tremble, ne'er believe The blow indeed can fall. So bow'd she there Over the dying, while unconscious prayer Fill'd all her soul. Now pour'd the moonlight down, Veining the pine stems through the foliage brown, And fire-flies, kindling up the leafy place, Cast fitful radiance o'er the warrior's face, Whereby she caught its changes: to her eye, The eye that faded look'd through gathering haze Whence love, o'ermastering mortal agony, Lifted a long, deep, melancholy gaze When voice was not: that fond, sad meaning pass'd: She knew the fulness of her woe at last! One shriek the forests heard—and mute she lay And cold; yet clasping still the precious clay To her scarce heaving breast. O Love and Death! Ye have sad meetings on this changeful earth, Many and sad! but airs of heavenly breath Shall melt the links which bind you, for your birth Is far apart. Now light of richer hue Than the moon sheds, came flushing mist and dew; The pines grew red with morning; fresh winds play'd; Bright-colour'd birds with splendour cross'd the shade, Flitting on flower-like wings; glad murmurs broke From reed, and spray, and leaf—the living strings Of earth's Æolian lyre, whose music woke Into young life and joy all happy things. And she too woke from that long dreamless trance, The widow'd Edith: fearfully her glance Fell, as in doubt, on faces dark and strange, And dusky forms. A sudden sense of change Flash'd o'er her spirit, even ere memory swept The tide of anguish back with thoughts that slept; Yet half instinctively she rose, and spread Her arms, as 'twere for something lost or fled, Then faintly sank again. The forest-bough, With all its whispers, waved not o'er her now— Where was she? 'Midst the people of the wild, By the red hunter's fire: an aged chief, Whose home look'd sad—for therein play'd no child— Had borne her, in the stillness of her grief, To that lone cabin of the woods; and there, Won by a form so desolately fair, Or touch'd with thoughts from some past sorrow sprung, O'er her low couch an Indian matron hung; While in grave silence, yet with earnest eye, The ancient warrior of the waste stood by, Bending in watchfulness his proud grey head, And leaning on his bow. And life return'd, Life, but with all its memories of the dead, To Edith's heart; and well the sufferer learn'd Her task of meek endurance, well she wore The chasten'd grief that humbly can adore, 'Midst blinding tears. But unto that old pair, Even as a breath of spring's awakening air, Her presence was; or as a sweet wild tune Bringing back tender thoughts, which all too soon Depart with childhood. Sadly they had seen A daughter to the land of spirits go, And ever from that time her fading mien, And voice, like winds of summer, soft and low, Had haunted their dim years; but Edith's face Now look'd in holy sweetness from her place, And they again seem'd parents. Oh! the joy, The rich deep blessedness—though earth's alloy, Fear, that still bodes, be there—of pouring forth The heart's whole power of love, its wealth and worth Of strong affection, in one healthful flow, On something all its own! that kindly glow, Which to shut inward is consuming pain, Gives the glad soul its flowering time again, When, like the sunshine, freed. And gentle cares Th' adopted Edith meekly gave for theirs Who loved her thus: her spirit dwelt the while With the departed, and her patient smile Spoke of farewells to earth; yet still she pray'd, Even o'er her soldier's lowly grave, for aid One purpose to fulfil, to leave one trace Brightly recording that her dwelling-place Had been among the wilds; for well she knew The secret whisper of her bosom true, Which warn'd her hence. And now, by many a word Link'd unto moments when the heart was stirr'd, By the sweet mournfulness of many a hymn, Sung when the woods at eve grew hush'd and dim— By the persuasion of her fervent eye, All eloquent with childlike piety— By the still beauty of her life, she strove To win for heaven, and heaven-born truth, the love Pour'd out on her so freely. Nor in vain Was that soft-breathing influence to enchain The soul in gentle bonds; by slow degrees Light follow'd on, as when a summer breeze Parts the deep masses of the forest shade And lets the sunbeam through:—her voice was made Even such a breeze; and she, a lowly guide, By faith and sorrow raised and purified, So to the Cross her Indian fosterers led, Until their prayers were one. When morning spread O'er the blue lake, and when the sunset's glow Touch'd into golden bronze the cypress bough, And when the quiet of the Sabbath time Sank on her heart, though no melodious chime Waken'd the wilderness, their prayers were one.— Now might she pass in hope, her work was done! And she was passing from the woods away— The broken flower of England might not stay Amidst those alien shades; her eye was bright Even yet with something of a starry light, But her form wasted, and her fair young cheek Wore oft and patiently a fatal streak, A rose whose root was death. The parting sigh Of autumn through the forests had gone by, And the rich maple o'er her wanderings lone Its crimson leaves in many a shower had strown, Flushing the air; and winter's blast had been Amidst the pines; and now a softer green Fringed their dark boughs; for spring again had come, The sunny spring! but Edith to her home Was journeying fast. Alas! we think it sad To part with life when all the earth looks glad In her young lovely things—when voices break Into sweet sounds, and leaves and blossoms wake; Is it not brighter then, in that far clime Where graves are not, nor blights of changeful time If here such glory dwell with passing blooms, Such golden sunshine rest around the tombs? So thought the dying one. 'Twas early day, And sounds and odours, with the breezes' play Whispering of spring-time, through the cabin door, Unto her couch life's farewell sweetness bore; Then with a look where all her hope awoke, “My father!”—to the grey-hair'd chief she spoke— “Know'st thou that I depart?”—“I know, I know,” He answer'd mournfully, “that thou must go To thy beloved, my daughter!”—“Sorrow not For me, kind mother!” with meek smiles once more She murmur'd in low tones; “one happy lot Awaits us, friends! upon the better shore; For we have pray'd together in one trust, And lifted our frail spirits from the dust To God, who gave them. Lay me by mine own, Under the cedar shade: where he is gone, Thither I go. There will my sisters be, And the dead parents, lisping at whose knee My childhood's prayer was learn'd—the Saviour's prayer Which now ye know—and I shall meet you there. Father and gentle mother! ye have bound The bruised reed, and mercy shall be found By Mercy's children.” From the matron's eye Dropp'd tears, her sole and passionate reply; But Edith felt them not; for now a sleep, Solemnly beautiful—a stillness deep, Fell on her settled face. Then, sad and slow, And mantling up his stately head in woe, “Thou'rt passing hence,” he sang, that warrior old, In sounds like those by plaintive waters roll'd. “Thou'rt passing from the lake's green side, And the hunter's hearth away; For the time of flowers, for the summer's pride, Daughter! thou canst not stay. “Thou'rt journeying to thy spirit's home, Where the skies are ever clear; The corn month's golden hours will come, But they shall not find thee here. “And we shall miss thy voice, my bird! Under our whispering pine; Music shall 'midst the leaves be heard, But not a song like thine. “A breeze that roves o'er stream and hill, Telling of winter gone, Hath such sweet falls—yet caught we still A farewell in its tone. “But thou, my bright one! thou shalt be Where farewell sounds are o'er; Thou, in the eyes thou lovest, shalt see No fear of parting more. “The mossy grave thy tears have wet, And the wind's wild moanings by, Thou with thy kindred shalt forget, 'Midst flowers—not such as die. “The shadow from thy brow shall melt The sorrow from thy strain, But where thine earthly smile hath dwelt Our hearts shall thirst in vain. Dim will our cabin be, and lone, When thou, its light, art fled; Yet hath thy step the pathway shown Unto the happy dead. “And we will follow thee, our guide! And join that shining band; Thou'rt passing from the lake's green side— Go to the better land!” The song had ceased—the listeners caught no breath, That lovely sleep had melted into death. THE INDIAN CITY. From a tale in Forbes's Oriental Memoirs. “What deep wounds ever closed without a sear? The heart's bleed longest, and but heal to wear That which disfigures it.” Childe Harold. I. Royal in splendour went down the day On the plain where an Indian city lay, With its crown of domes o'er the forest high, Red, as if fused in the burning sky, And its deep groves pierced by the rays which made A bright stream's way through each long arcade, Till the pillar'd vaults of the banian stood, Like torch-lit aisles 'midst the solemn wood, And the plantain glitter'd with leaves of gold, As a tree 'midst the genii gardens old, And the cypress lifted a blazing spire, And the stems of the cocoa's were shafts of fire. Many a white pagoda's gleam Slept lovely round upon lake and stream, Broken alone by the lotus flowers, As they caught the glow of the sun's last hours, Like rosy wine in their cups, and shed Its glory forth on their crystal bed. Many a graceful Hindoo maid, With the water vase from the palmy shade, Came gliding light as the desert's roe, Down marble steps, to the tanks below; And a cool sweet plashing was ever heard, As the molten glass of the wave was stirr'd; And a murmur, thrilling the scented air, Told where the Bramin bow'd in prayer. There wander'd a noble Moslem boy Through the scene of beauty in breathless joy; He gazed where the stately city rose, Like a pageant of clouds, in its red repose; He turn'd where birds through the gorgeous gloom Of the woods went glancing on starry plume; He track'd the brink of the shining lake, By the tall canes feather'd in tuft and brake, Till the path he chose, in its mazes wound To the very heart of the holy ground. And there lay the water, as if enshrined In a rocky urn, from the sun and wind, Bearing the hues of the grove on high, Far down through its dark still purity. The flood beyond, to the fiery west, Spread out like a metal mirror's breast, But that lone bay, in its dimness deep, Seem'd made for the swimmer's joyous leap, For the stag athirst from the noontide chase, For all free things of the wild wood's race. Like a falcon's glance on the wide blue sky, Was the kindling flash of the boy's glad eye; Like a sea-bird's flight to the foaming wave, From the shadowy bank was the bound he gave; Dashing the spray drops, cold and white, O'er the glossy leaves in its young delight, And bowing his locks to the waters clear— Alas! he dreamt not that fate was near. His mother look'd from her tent the while, O'er heaven and earth with a quiet smile: She, on her way unto Mecca's fane, Had stay'd the march of her pilgrim train, Calmly to linger a few brief hours In the Bramin city's glorious bowers; For the pomp of the forest, the wave's bright fall, The red gold of sunset—she loved them all. II. The moon rose clear in the splendour given To the deep-blue night of an Indian heaven; The boy from the high-arch'd woods came back— Oh! what had he met in his lonely track? The serpent's glance, through the long reeds bright? The arrowy spring of the tiger's might? No!—yet as one by a conflict worn, With his graceful hair all soil'd and torn, And a gloom on the lids of his darken'd eye, And a gash on his bosom—he came to die! He look'd for the face to his young heart sweet, And found it, and sank at his mother's feet. “Speak to me!—whence doth the swift blood run? What hath befallen thee, my child, my son?” The mist of death on his brow lay pale, But his voice just linger'd to breathe the tale, Murmuring faintly of wrongs and scorn, And wounds from the children of Brahma borne: This was the doom for a Moslem found With a foot profane on their holy ground— This was for sullying the pure waves, free Unto them alone—'twas their God's deoree. A change came o'er his wandering look— The mother shriek'd not then nor shook: Breathless she knelt in her son's young blood, Rending her mantle to stanch its flood; But it rush'd like a river which none may stay, Bearing a flower to the deep away. That which our love to the earth would chain, Fearfully striving with heaven in vain— That which fades from us, while yet we hold, Clasp'd to our bosoms, its mortal mould, Was fleeting before her, afar and fast; One moment—the soul from the face had pass'd! Are there no words for that common woe?— Ask of the thousands, its depths that know! The boy had breathed, in his dreaming rest, Like a low-voiced dove, on her gentle breast; He had stood, when she sorrow'd, beside her knee, Painfully stilling his quick heart's glee; He had kiss'd from her cheek the widow's tears, With the loving lip of his infant years; He had smiled o'er her path like a bright spring day— Now in his blood on the earth he lay! Murder'd!—Alas! and we love so well In a world where anguish like this can dwell! She bow'd down mutely o'er her dead— They that stood round her watch'd in dread; They watch'd—she knew not they were by— Her soul sat veil'd in its agony. On the silent lip she press'd no kiss, Too stern was the grasp of her pangs for this: She shed no tear as her face bent low, O'er the shining hair of the lifeless brow; She look'd but into the half-shut eye With a gaze that found there no reply, And shrieking, mantled her head from sight, And fell, struck down by her sorrow's might. And what deep change, what work of power, Was wrought on her secret soul that hour? How rose the lonely one?—She rose Like a prophetess from dark repose! And proudly flung from her face the veil, And shook the hair from her forehead pale, And 'midst her wondering handmaids stood, With the sudden glance of a dauntless mood— Ay, lifting up to the midnight sky A brow in its regal passion high, With a close and rigid grasp she press'd The blood-stain'd robe to her heaving breast, And said—“Not yet—not yet I weep, Not yet my spirit shall sink or sleep; Not till yon city, in ruins rent, Be piled for its victim's monument. Cover his dust! bear it on before!— It shall visit those temple gates once more.” And away in the train of the dead she turn'd, The strength of her step was the heart that burn'd; And the Bramin groves in the starlight smiled, As the mother pass'd with her slaughter'd child. III. Hark! a wild sound of the desert's horn Through the woods round the Indian city borne, A peal of the cymbal and tambour afar— War! 'tis the gathering of Moslem war! The Bramin look'd from the leaguer'd towers— He saw the wild archer amidst his bowers; And the lake that flash'd through the plantain shade, As the light of the lances along it play'd; And the canes that shook as if winds were high When the fiery steed of the waste swept by; And the camp as it lay like a billowy sea, Wide round the sheltering banian tree. There stood one tent from the rest apart— That was the place of a wounded heart. Oh! deep is a wounded heart, and strong A voice that cries against mighty wrong; And full of death as a hot wind's blight, Doth the ire of a crush'd affection light. Maimuna from realm to realm had pass'd, And her tale had rung like a trumpet's blast. There had been words from her pale lips pour'd, Each one a spell to unsheath the sword. The Tartar had sprung from his steed to hear, And the dark chief of Araby grasp'd his spear, Till a chain of long lances begirt the wall, And a vow was recorded that doom'd its fall. Back with the dust of her son she came, When her voice had kindled that lightning flame; She came in the might of a queenly foe, Banner, and javelin, and bended bow; But a deeper power on her forehead sate— There sought the warrior his star of fate: Her eye's wild flash through the tented line Was hail'd as a spirit and a sign, And the faintest tone from her lip was caught As a sybil's breath of prophetic thought. —Vain, bitter glory!—the gift of grief, That lights up vengeance to find relief, Transient and faithless!—it cannot fill So the deep void of the heart, nor till The yearning left by a broken tie, That haunted fever of which we die! Sickening she turn'd from her sad renown, As a king in death might reject his crown; Slowly the strength of the walls gave way— She wither'd faster from day to day. All the proud sounds of that banner'd plain, To stay the flight of her soul were vain; Like an eagle caged, it had striven, and worn The frail dust, ne'er for such conflicts born, Till the bars were rent, and the hour was come For its fearful rushing through darkness home. The bright sun set in his pomp and pride, As on that eve when the fair boy died; She gazed from her couch, and a softness fell O'er her weary heart with the day's farewell; She spoke, and her voice, in its dying tone, Had an echo of feelings that long seem'd flown. She murmur'd a low sweet cradle song, Strange 'midst the din of a warrior throng— A song of the time when her boy's young cheek Had glow'd on her breast in its slumber meek; But something which breathed from that mournful strain Sent a fitful gust o'er her soul again, And starting, as if from a dream, she cried— “Give him proud burial at my side! There, by yon lake, where the palm boughs wave, When the temples are fallen, make there our grave.” And the temples fell, though the spirit pass'd, That stay'd not for victory's voice at last; When the day was won for the martyr dead, For the broken heart and the bright blood shed. Through the gates of the vanquish'd the Tartar steed Bore in the avenger with foaming speed; Free swept the flame through the idol fanes, And the streams glow'd red, as from warrior veins, And the sword of the Moslem, let loose to slay, Like the panther leapt on its flying prey, Till a city of ruin begirt the shade Where the boy and his mother at rest were laid. Palace and tower on that plain were left, Like fallen trees by the lightning cleft; The wild vine mantled the stately square, The Rajah's throne was the serpent's lair, And the jungle grass o'er the altar sprung— This was the work of one deep heart wrung! THE PEASANT GIRL OF THE RHONE. —“There is but one place in the world Thither, where he lies buried! There, there is all that still remains of him— That single spot is tho whole earth to me.” Coleridge's Wallenstem. “Alas! our young affections run to waste, Or water but the desert.” Childe Harold. There went a warrior's funeral through the night, A waving of tall plumes, a ruddy light Of torches, fitfully and wildly thrown From the high woods, along the sweeping Rhone, Far down the waters. Heavily and dead, Under the moaning trees, the horse-hoof's tread In muffled sounds upon the greensward fell, As chieftains pass'd; and solemnly the swell Of the deep requiem, o'er the gleaming river Borne with the gale, and with the leaves low shiver Floated and died. Proud mourners there, yet pale, Wore man's mute anguish sternly;—but of one, Oh! who shall speak? What words his brow unveil? A father following to the grave his son! That is no grief to picture! Sad and slow, Thro' the wood shadows, moved the knightly train, With youth's fair form upon the bier laid low— Fair even when found, amidst the bloody slain, Stretch'd by its broken lance. They reach'd the lone Baronial chapel, where the forest gloom Fell heaviest, for the massy boughs had grown Into thick archways, as to vault the tomb. Stately they trode the hollow ringing aisle, A strange deep echo shudder'd through the pile, Till crested heads at last, in silence bent Round the De Couci's antique monument, When dust to dust was given:—and Aymer slept Beneath the drooping banners of his line, Whose broider'd folds the Syrian wind had swept Proudly and oft o'er fields of Palestine: So the sad rite was closed. The sculptor gave Trophies, erelong, to deck that lordly grave; And the pale image of a youth, array'd As warriors are for fight, but calmly laid In slumber on his shield. Then all was done— All still around the dead. His name was heard Perchance when wine-cups flow'd, and hearts were stirr'd By some old song, or tale of battle won, Told round the hearth: but in his father's breast Manhood's high passions woke again, and press'd On to their mark; and in his friend's clear eye There dwelt no shadow of a dream gone by; And with the brethren of his fields, the feast Was gay as when the voice whose sounds had ceased Mingled with theirs. Even thus life's rushing tide Bears back affection from the grave's dark side; Alas! to think of this!—the heart's void place Fill'd up so soon!—so like a summer cloud, All that we loved to pass and leave no trace!— He lay forgotten in his early shroud. Forgotten?—not of all!—the sunny smile Glancing in play o'er that proud lip erewhile, And the dark locks, whose breezy waving threw A gladness round, whene'er their shade withdrew From the bright brow; and all the sweetness lying Within that eagle eye's jet radiance deep, And all the music with that young voice dying, Whose joyous echoes made the quick heart leap As at a hunter's bugle—these things lived Still in one breast, whose silent love survived The pomps of kindred sorrow. Day by day, On Aymer's tomb fresh flowers in garlands lay, Through the dim fane soft summer odours breathing, And all the pale sepulchral trophies wreathing, And with a flush of deeper brilliance glowing In the rich light, like molten rubies flowing Through storied windows down. The violet there Might speak of love—a secret love and lowly— And the rose image all things fleet and fair, And the faint passion-flower, the sad and holy, Tell of diviner hopes. But whose light hand, As for an altar, wove the radiant band? Whose gentle nurture brought, from hidden dells, That gem-like wealth of blossoms and sweet bells, To blush through every season?—Blight and chill Might touch the changing woods; but duly still. For years those gorgeous coronals renew'd, And brightly clasping marble spear and helm, Even through mid-winter, fill'd the solitude With a strange smile—a glow of summer's realm. Surely some fond and fervent heart was pouring Its youth's vain worship on the dust, adoring In lone devotedness! One spring morn rose, And found, within that tomb's proud shadow laid— Oh! not as 'midst the vineyards, to repose From the fierce noon—a dark-hair'd peasant maid: Who could reveal her story? That still face Had once been fair; for on the clear arch'd brow And the curved lip there lingered yet such grace As sculpture gives its dreams; and long and low The deep black lashes, o'er the half-shut eye— For death was on its lids—fell mournfully. But the cold cheek was sunk, the raven hair Dimm'd, the slight form all wasted, as by care. Whence came that early blight? Her kindred's place Was not amidst the high De Couci race; Yet there her shrine had been! She grasp'd a wreath— The tomb's last garland!—This was love in death. INDIAN WOMAN'S DEATH-SONG. “Non, je ne puis vivre avec un cœur brisé. II faut que je retrouve la joie, et que je m'unisse aux esprits libres de l'air.” Bride of Messina—translated by Madame de Stael. “Let not my child be a girl, for very sad is the life of a woman.” The Prairie. Down a broad river of the western wilds, Piercing thick forest glooms, a light canoe Swept with the current: fearful was the speed Of the frail bark, as by a tempest's wing Borne leaf-like on to where the mist of spray Rose with the cataract's thunder. Yet within, Proudly, and dauntlessly, and all alone, Save that a babe lay sleeping at her breast, A woman stood: upon her Indian brow Sat a strange gladness, and her dark hair waved As if triumphantly. She press'd her child, In its bright slumber, to her beating heart, And lifted her sweet voice, that rose awhile Above the sound of waters, high and clear, Wafting a wild proud strain—or song of death “Roll swiftly to the spirit's land, thou mighty stream and free! Father of ancient waters, roll! and bear our lives with thee! The weary bird that storms have toss'd would seek the sunshine's calm, And the deer that hath the arrow's hurt flies to the woods of balm. “Roll on!—my warrior's eye hath look'd upon another's face, And mine hath faded from his soul, as fades a moonbeam's trace: My shadow comes not o'er his path, my whisper to his dream, He flings away the broken reed—roll swifter yet, thou stream! “The voice that spoke of other days is hush'd within his breast, But mine its lonely music haunts, and will not let me rest; It sings a low and mournful song of gladness that is gone, I cannot live without that light—father of waves! roll on! “Will he not miss the bounding step that met him from the chase? The heart of love that made his home an ever-sunny place? The hand that spread the hunter's board, and deck'd his couch of yore?— He will not!—roll, dark foaming stream, on to the better shore! “Some blessed fount amidst the woods of that bright land must flow, Whose waters from my soul may lave the memory of this woe; Some gentle wind must whisper there, whose breath may waft away The burden of the heavy night, the sadness of the day. “And thou, my babe! though born, like me, for woman's weary lot, Smile!—to that wasting of the heart, my own! I leave thee not; Too bright a thing art thou to pine in aching love away, Thy mother bears thee far, young Fawn! from sorrow and decay. “She bears thee to the glorious bowers where none are heard to weep, And where th' unkind one hath no power again to trouble sleep; And where the soul shall find its youth, as wakening from a dream— One moment, and that realm is ours—On, on, dark rolling stream!” JOAN OF ARC IN RHEIMS. Thou hast a charmed cup, O Fame! A draught that mantles high, And seems to lift this earth born frame Above mortality: Away! to me—a woman—bring Sweet waters from affection's spring. That was a joyous day in Rheims of old, When peal on peal of mighty music roll'd Forth from her throng'd cathedral; while around, A multitude, whose billows made no sound, Chain'd to a hush of wonder, though elate With victory, listen'd at their temple's gate. And what was done within?—within, the light Through the rich gloom of pictured windows flowing, Tinged with soft awfulness a stately sight, The chivalry of France their proud heads bowing In martial vassalage!—While 'midst that ring, And shadow'd by ancestral tombs, a king Received his birthright's crown. For this, the hymn Swell'd out like rushing waters, and the day With the sweet censer's misty breath grew dim, As through long aisles it floated o'er th' array Of arms and sweeping stoles. But who, alone And unapproach'd, beside the altar stone, With the white banner forth like sunshine streaming, And the gold helm thro' clouds of fragrance gleaming, Silent and radiant stood?—the helm was raised, And the fair face reveal'd, that upward gazed, Intensely worshipping:—a still, clear face, Youthful, but brightly solemn!—Woman's cheek And brow were there, in deep devotion meek, Yet glorified, with inspiration's trace On its pure paleness; while, enthroned above, The pictured Virgin, with her smile of love, Seem'd bending o'er her votaress. That slight form! Was that the leader through the battle storm? Had the soft light in that adoring eye Guided the warrior where the swords flash'd high? 'Twas so, even so!—and thou, the shepherd's child, Joanne, the lowly dreamer of the wild! Never before, and never since that hour, Hath woman, mantled with victorious power, Stood forth as thou beside the shrine didst stand, Holy amidst the knighthood of the land; And beautiful with joy and with renown, Lift thy white banner o'er the olden crown, Ransom'd for France by thee! The rites are done. Now let the dome with trumpet notes be shaken, And bid the echoes of the tomb awaken, And come thou forth, that Heaven's rejoicing sun May give thee welcome from thine own blue skies, Daughter of victory!—A triumphant strain, A proud rich stream of warlike melodies, Gush'd through the portals of the antique fane, And forth she came. Then rose a nation's sound— Oh! what a power to bid the quick heart bound, The wind bears onward with the stormy cheer Man gives to glory on her high career! Is there indeed such power?—far deeper dwells In one kind household voice, to reach the cells Whence happiness flows forth! The shouts that fill'd The hollow heaven tempestuously, were still'd One moment; and in that brief pause, the tone, As of a breeze that o'er her home had blown, Sank on the bright maid's heart.—“Joanne!”—Who spoke Like those whose childhood with her childhood grew Under one roof?—“Joanne!”—that murmur broke With sounds of weeping forth!—She turn'd—she knew Beside her, mark'd from all the thousands there, In the calm beauty of his silver hair, The stately shepherd; and the youth, whose joy From his dark eye flash'd proudly; and the boy, The youngest born, that ever loved her best:— “Father! and ye, my brothers!”—On the breast Of that grey sire she sank—and swiftly back, Even in an instant, to their native track Her free thoughts flow'd.—She saw the pomp no more The plumes, the banners:—to her cabin-door, And to the Fairy's fountain in the glade, Where her young sisters by her side had play'd, And to her hamlet's chapel, where it rose Hallowing the forest unto deep repose, Her spirit turn'd. The very wood-note, sung In early spring-time by the bird, which dwelt Where o'er her father's roof the beech leaves hung, Was in her heart; a music heard and felt, Winning her back to nature. She unbound The helm of many battles from her head, And, with her bright locks bow'd to sweep the ground, Lifting her voice up, wept for joy and said— “Bless me, my father, bless me! and with thee, To the still cabin and the beechen tree, Let me return!” Oh! never did thine eye Through the green haunts of happy infancy Wander again, Joanne!—too much of fame Had shed its radiance on thy peasant name; And bought alone by gifts beyond all price— The trusting heart's repose, the paradise Of home, with all its loves—doth fate allow The crown of glory unto woman's brow. PAULINE. To die for what we love!—Oh! there is power In the true heart, and pride, and joy, for this; It is to live without the vanish'd light That strength is needed. “Così trapassa al trapassar d'un Giorno Della vita mortal il fiore e'l verde.” Tasso. Along the starlit Seine went music swelling, Till the air thrill'd with its exulting mirth; Proudly it floated, even as if no dwelling For cares or stricken hearts were found on earth; And a glad sound the measure lightly beat, A happy chime of many dancing feet. For in a palace of the land that night, Lamps, and fresh roses, and green leaves were hung, And from the painted walls a stream of light On flying forms beneath soft splendour flung: But loveliest far amidst the revel's pride Was one—the lady from the Danube side. Pauline, the meekly bright! though now no more Her clear eye flash'd with youth's all-tameless glee, Yet something holier than its dayspring wore, There in soft rest lay beautiful to see; A charm with graver, tenderer, sweetness fraught— The blending of deep love and matron thought. Through the gay throng she moved, serenely fair, And such calm joy as fills a moonlight sky Sate on her brow beneath its graceful hair, As her young daughter in the dance went by, With the fleet step of one that yet hath known Smiles and kind voices in this world alone. Lurk'd there no secret boding in her breast? Did no faint whisper warn of evil nigh? Such oft awake when most the heart seems blest 'Midst the light laughter of festivity: Whence come those tones!—Alas! enough we know To mingle fear with all triumphal show! Who spoke of evil when young feet were flying In fairy rings around the echoing hall? Soft airs through braided locks in perfume sighing, Glad pulses beating unto music's call? Silence!—the minstrels pause—and hark! a sound, A strange quick rustling which their notes had drown'd! And lo! a light upon the dancers breaking— Not such their clear and silvery lamps had shed! From the gay dream of revelry awaking, One moment holds them still in breathless dread; The wild fierce lustre grows—then bursts a cry— Fire! through the hall and round it gathering—fly! And forth they rush, as chased by sword and spear, To the green coverts of the garden bowers; A gorgeous masque of pageantry and fear, Startling the birds and trampling down the flowers; While from the dome behind, red sparkles driven Pierce the dark stillness of the midnight heaven. And where is she—Pauline? the hurrying throng Have swept her onward, as a stormy blast Might sweep some faint o'erwearied bird along— Till now the threshold of that death is past, And free she stands beneath the starry skies, Calling her child—but no sweet voice replies. “Bertha! where art thou?—Speak! oh, speak! my own!” Alas! unconscious of her pangs the while, The gentle girl, in fear's cold grasp alone, Powerless hath sunk within the blazing pile; A young bright form, deck'd gloriously for death, With flowers all shrinking from the flame's fierce breath! But oh! thy strength, deep love!—there is no power To stay the mother from that rolling grave, Though fast on high the fiery volumes tower, And forth, like banners from each lattice wave; Back, back she rushes through a host combined— Mighty is anguish, with affection twined! And what bold step may follow, 'midst the roar Of the red billows, o'er their prey that rise? None!—Courage there stood still—and never more Did those fair forms emerge on human eyes! Was one brief meeting theirs, one wild farewell? And died they heart to heart?—Oh! who can tell? Freshly and cloudlessly the morning broke On that sad palace, 'midst its pleasure shades; Its painted roofs had sunk—yet black with smoke And lonely stood its marble colonnades: But yester eve their shafts with wreaths were bound, Now lay the scene one shrivell'd scroll around! And bore the ruins no recording trace Of all that woman's heart had dared and done? Yes! there were gems to mark its mortal place, That forth from dust and ashes dimly shone! Those had the mother, on her gentle breast, Worn round her child's fair image, there at rest. And they were all!—the tender and the true Left this alone her sacrifice to prove, Hallowing the spot where mirth once lightly flew, To deep lone chasten'd thoughts of grief and love. Oh! we have need of patient faith below, To clear away the mysteries of such woe! JUANA. It is but dust thou look'st upon. This love, This wild and passionate idolatry, What doth it in the shadow of the grave? Gather it back within thy lonely heart, So must it ever end: too much we give Unto the things that perish. The night wind shook the tapestry round an ancient palace room, And torches, as it rose and fell, waved through the gorgeous gloom, And o'er a shadowy regal couch threw fitful gleams and red, Where a woman with long raven hair sat watching by the dead. Pale shone the features of the dead, yet glorious still to see, Like a hunter or a chief struck down while his heart and step were free; No shroud he wore, no robe of death, but there majestic lay, Proudly and sadly glittering in royalty's array. But she that with the dark hair watch'd by the cold slumberer's side, On her wan cheek no beauty dwelt, and in her garb no pride; Only her full impassion'd eyes, as o'er that clay she bent, A wildness and a tenderness in strange resplendence blent. And as the swift thoughts cross'd her soul, like shadows of a cloud, Amidst the silent room of death, the dreamer spoke aloud; She spoke to him that could not hear, and cried, “Thou yet wilt wake, And learn my watchings and my tears, beloved one! for thy sake. “They told me this was death, but well I knew it could not be; Fairest and stateliest of the earth! who spoke of death for thee? They would have wrapp'd the funeral shroud thy gallant form around, But I forbade—and there thou art, a monarch, robed and crown'd! “With all thy bright locks gleaming still, their coronal beneath, And thy brow so proudly beautiful—who said that this was death? Silence hath been upon thy lips, and stillness round thee long, But the hopeful spirit in my breast is all undimm'd and strong. “I know thou hast not loved me yet; I am not fair like thee, The very glance of whose clear eye threw round a light of glee! A frail and drooping form is mine—a cold unsmiling cheek, Oh! I have but a woman's heart wherewith thy heart to seek. “But when thou wakest, my prince, my lord! and hear'st how I have kept A lonely vigil by thy side, and o'er thee pray'd and wept— How in one long deep dream of thee my nights and days have past— Surely that humble, patient love must win back love at last! And thou wilt smile—my own, my own, shall be the sunny smile, Which brightly fell, and joyously, on all but me erewhile! No more in vain affection's thirst my weary soul shall pine— Oh! years of hope deferr'd were paid by one fond glance of thine! “Thou'lt meet me with that radiant look when thou comest from the chase, For me, for me, in festal halls it shall kindle o'er thy face! Thou'lt reck no more though beauty's gift mine aspect may not bless; In thy kind eyes, this deep, deep love, shall give me loveliness. “But wake! my heart within me burns, yet once more to rejoice In the sound to which it ever leap'd, the music of thy voice: Awake! I sit in solitude, that thy first look and tone, And the gladness of thine opening eyes, may all be mine alone.” In the still chambers of the dust, thus pour'd forth day by day, The passion of that loving dream from a troubled soul found way, Until the shadows of the grave had swept o'er every grace, Left 'midst the awfulness of death on the princely form and face. And slowly broke the fearful truth upon the watcher's breast, And they bore away the royal dead with requiems to his rest, With banners and with knightly plumes all waving in the wind— But a woman's broken heart was left in its lone despair behind. THE AMERICAN FOREST GIRL. A fearful gift upon thy heart is laid, Woman!—a power to suffer and to love— Therefore thou so canst pity. Wildly and mournfully the Indian drum On the deep hush of moonlight forests broke— Sing us a death-song, for thine hour is come”— So the red warriors to their captive spoke. Still, and amidst those dusky forms alone, A youth, a fair-hair'd youth of England stood, Like a king's son; though from his cheek had flown The mantling crimson of the island blood, And his press'd lips look'd marble. Fiercely bright, And high around him blazed the fires of night, Rocking beneath the cedars to and fro, As the wind pass'd, and with a fitful glow Lighting the victim's face: but who could tell Of what within his secret heart befell, Known but to heaven that hour?—Perchance a thought Of his far home then so intensely wrought, That its full image, pictured to his eye On the dark ground of mortal agony, Rose clear as day!—and he might see the band Of his young sisters wand'ring hand in hand, Where the laburnums droop'd; or haply binding The jasmine up the door's low pillars winding; Or, as day closed upon their gentle mirth, Gathering, with braided hair, around the hearth, Where sat their mother; and that mother's face Its grave sweet smile yet wearing in the place Where so it ever smiled!—Perchance the prayer Learn'd at her knee came back on his despair; The blessing from her voice, the very tone Of her “Good-night” might breathe from boyhoo gone!— He started and look'd up: thick cypress boughs, Full of strange sound, waved o'er him, darkly In the broad stormy firelight; savage brows, With tall plumes crested and wild hues o'erspread Girt him like feverish phantoms; and pale stars Look'd through the branches as through dungeon bars, Shedding no hope.—He knew, he felt his doom— Oh! what a tale to shadow with its gloom That happy hall in England!—Idle fear! Would the winds tell it?—Who might dream or hear The secret of the forests?—To the stake They bound him; and that proud young soldier strove His father's spirit in his breast to wake, Trusting to die in silence! He, the love Of many hearts!—the fondly rear'd—the fair, Gladdening all eyes to see!—And fetter'd there He stood beside his death-pyre, and the brand Flamed up to light it in the chieftain's hand. He thought upon his God.—Hush! hark! a cry Breaks on the stern and dread solemnity— A step hath pierced the ring!—Who dares intrude On the dark hunters in their vengeful mood?— A girl—a young slight girl—a fawn-like child Of green savannas and the leafy wild, Springing unmark'd till then, as some lone flower, Happy because the sunshine is its dower; Yet one that knew how early tears are shed, For hers had mourn'd a playmate brother dead. She had sat gazing on the victim long, Until the pity of her soul grew strong; And, by its passion's deepening fervour sway'd, Even to the stake she rush'd, and gently laid His bright head on her bosom, and around His form her slender arms to shield it wound Like close Liannes; then raised her glittering eye, And clear-toned voice, that said, “He shall not die!” “He shall not die!”—the gloomy forest thrill'd To that sweet sound. A sudden wonder fell On the fierce throng; and heart and hand were still'd, Struck down as by the whisper of a spell. They gazed—their dark souls bow'd before the maid, She of the dancing step in wood and glade! And, as her cheek flush'd through its olive hue, As her black tresses to the night wind flew, Something o'ermaster'd them from that young mien— Something of heaven, in silence felt and seen; And seeming, to their childlike faith, a token That the Great Spirit by her voice had spoken. They loosed the bonds that held their captive's breath; From his pale lips they took the cup of death; They quench'd the brand beneath the cypress-tree; “Away,” they cried, “young stranger, thou art free!” COSTANZA. Art thou then desolate? Of friends, of hopes forsaken? Come to me! I am thine own. Have trusted hearts proved false? Flatterers deceived thee? Wanderer, come to me! Why didst thou ever leave me? Know'st thou all I would have borne, and call'd it joy to bear, For thy sake? Know'st thou that thy voice had power To shake me with a thrill of happiness By one kind tone?—to fill mine eyes with tears Of yearning love?—And thou—oh! thou didst throw That crush'd affection back upon my heart; Yet come to me!—it died not. She knelt in prayer. A stream of sunset fell Through the stain'd widow of her lonely cell, And with its rich, deep, melancholy glow, Flushing her cheek and pale Madonna brow, While o'er her long hair's flowing jet it threw Bright waves of gold—the autumn forest's hue— Seem'd all a vision's mist of glory, spread By painting's touch around some holy head, Virgin's or fairest martyr's. In her eye Which glanced as dark clear water to the sky, What solemn fervour lived! And yet what woe, Lay like some buried thing, still seen below The glassy tide! Oh! he that could reveal What life had taught that chasten'd heart to feel, Might speak indeed of woman's blighted years, And wasted love, and vainly bitter tears! But she had told her griefs to Heaven alone, And of the gentle saint no more was known, Than that she fled the world's cold breath, and made A temple of the pine and chestnut shade, Filling its depths with soul, whene'er her hymn Rose through each murmur of the green, and dim, And ancient solitude; where hidden streams Went moaning through the grass, like sounds in dreams— Music for weary hearts! 'Midst leaves and flowers She dwelt, and knew all secrets of their powers, All nature's balms, wherewith her gliding tread To the sick peasant on his lowly bed, Came and brought hope; while scarce of mortal birth He deem'd the pale fair form that held on earth Communion but with grief. Ere long, a cell, A rock-hewn chapel rose, a cross of stone Gleam'd through the dark trees o'er a sparkling well, And a sweet voice of rich, yet mournful tone, Told the Calabrian wilds, that duly there Costanza lifted her sad heart in prayer. And now 'twas prayer's own hour. That voice again Through the dim foliage sent its heavenly strain. That made the cypress quiver where it stood, In day's last crimson soaring from the wood Like spiry flame. But as the bright sun set, Other and wilder sounds in tumult met The floating song. Strange sounds!—the trumpet's peal, Made hollow by the rocks; the clash of steel; The rallying war-cry. In the mountain pass There had been combat; blood was on the grass, Banners had strewn the waters; chiefs lay dying, And the pine branches crash'd before the flying. And all was changed within the still retreat, Costanza's home: there enter'd hurrying feet, Dark looks of shame and sorrow; mail-clad men, Stern fugitives from that wild battle glen, Scaring the ringdoves from the porch roof, bore A wounded warrior in: the rocky floor Gave back deep echoes to his clanging sword, As there they laid their leader, and implored The sweet saint's prayers to heal him: then for flight, Through the wide forest and the mantling night, Sped breathlessly again. They pass'd—but he, The stateliest of a host—alas! to see What mother's eyes have watch'd in rosy sleep, Till joy, for very fulness, turn'd to weep, Thus changed!—a fearful thing! His golden crest Was shiver'd, and the bright scarf on his breast— Some costly love gift—rent—but what of these? There were the clustering raven-locks—the breeze, As it came in through lime and myrtle flowers, Might scarcely lift them—steep'd in bloody showers So heavily upon the pallid clay Of the damp cheek they hung!—the eyes' dark ray— Where was it?—and the lips!—they gasp'd apart, With their light curve, as from the chisel's art, Still proudly beautiful! but that white hue— Was it not death's?—that stillness—that cold dew On the scarr'd forehead? No! his spirit broke From its deep trance erelong, yet but awoke To wander in wild dreams; and there he lay, By the fierce fever as a green reed shaken, The haughty chief of thousands—the forsaken Of all save one.—She fled not. Day by day— Such hours are woman's birthright—she, unknown, Kept watch beside him, fearless and alone; Binding his wounds, and oft in silence laving His brow with tears that mourn'd the strong man's raving. He felt them not, nor mark'd the light veil'd form Still hovering nigh! yet sometimes, when that storm Of frenzy sank, her voice, in tones as low As a young mother's by the cradle singing, Would sooth him with sweet aves, gently bringing Moments of slumber, when the fiery glow Ebb'd from his hollow cheek. At last faint gleams Of memory dawn'd upon the cloud of dreams, And feebly lifting, as a child, his head, And gazing round him from his leafy bed, He murmur'd forth, “Where am I? What soft strain Pass'd, like a breeze, across my burning brain? Back from my youth it floated, with a tone Of life's first music, and a thought of one— Where is she now? and where the gauds of pride, Whose hollow splendour lured me from her side? All lost!—and this is death!—I cannot die Without forgiveness from that mournful eye! Away! the earth hath lost her. Was she born To brook abandonment, to strive with scorn? My first, my holiest love!—her broken heart Lies low, and I—unpardon'd I depart.” But then Costanza raised the shadowy veil From her dark locks and features brightly pale, And stood before him with a smile—oh! ne'er Did aught that smiled so much of sadness wear— And said, “Cesario! look on me; I live To say my heart hath bled, and can forgive. I loved thee with such worship, such deep trust, As should be Heaven's alone—and Heaven is just! I bless thee—be at peace!” But o'er his frame Too fast the strong tide rush'd—the sudden shame, The joy, th' amaze! He bow'd his head—it fell On the wrong'd bosom which had loved so well; And love, still perfect, gave him refuge there— His last faint breath just waved her floating hair. MADELINE. A DOMESTIC TALE. “Who should it be?—Where shouldst thou look for kindness? When we are sick where can we turn for succour; When we are wretched where can we complain; And when the world looks cold and surly on us, Where can we go to meet a warmer eye With such sure confidence as to a mother?” Joanna Baillie. “My child, my child, thou leavest me!—I shall hear The gentle voice no more that blest mine ear With its first utterance: I shall miss the sound Of thy light step amidst the flowers around, And thy soft-breathing hymn at twilight's close, And thy ‘Good-night’ at parting for repose. Under the vine leaves I shall sit alone, And the low breeze will have a mournful tone Amidst their tendrils, while I think of thee, My child! and thou, along the moonlight sea, With a soft sadness haply in thy glance, Shalt watch thine own, thy pleasant land of France, Fading to air. Yet blessings with thee go! Love guard thee, gentlest! and the exile's woe From thy young heart be far! And sorrow not For me, sweet daughter! in my lonely lot God shall be with me. Now, farewell! farewell! Thou that hast been what words may never tell Unto thy mother's bosom, since the days When thou wert pillow'd there, and wont to raise In sudden laughter thence thy loving eye That still sought mine: these moments are gone by— Thou too must go, my flower! Yet with thee dwell The peace of God! One, one more gaze—fare well!” This was a mother's parting with her child, A young meek bride, on whom fair fortune smiled, And woo'd her with a voice of love away From childhood's home; yet there, with fond delay, She linger'd on the threshold, heard the note Of her caged bird through trellis'd rose-leaves float, And fell upon her mother's neck and wept, Whilst old remembrances, that long had slept, Gush'd o'er her soul, and many a vanish'd day, As in one picture traced, before her lay. But the farewell was said; and on the deep, When its breast heaved in sunset's golden sleep, With a calm'd heart, young Madeline, erelong, Pour'd forth her own sweet, solemn vesper-song, Breathing of home: through stillness heard afar, And duly rising with the first pale star, That voice was on the waters; till at last The sounding ocean solitudes were pass'd, And the bright land was reach'd—the youthful world That glows along the west: the sails were furl'd In its clear sunshine, and the gentle bride Look'd on the home that promised hearts untried A bower of bliss to come. Alas! we trace The map of our own paths, and long ere years With their dull steps the brilliant lines efface, On sweeps the storm, and blots them out with tears! That home was darken'd soon: the summer breeze Welcomed with death the wanderers from the seas— Death unto one, and anguish—how forlorn! To her that, widow'd in her marriage morn, Sat in her voiceless dwelling, whence with him, Her bosom's first beloved, her friend and guide, Joy had gone forth, and left the green earth dim, As from the sun shut out on every side, By the close veil of misery! Oh! but ill, When with rich hopes o'erfraught, the young high heart Bears its first blow! it knows not yet the part Which life will teach—to suffer and be still, And with submissive love to count the flowers Which yet are spared, and through the future hours To send no busy dream! She had not learn'd Of sorrow till that hour, and therefore turn'd In weariness from life: then came th' unrest, The heart-sick yearning of the exile's breast, The haunting sounds of voices far away, And household steps: until at last she lay On her lone couch of sickness, lost in dreams Of the gay vineyards and blue rushing streams In her own sunny land, and murmuring oft Familiar names, in accents wild, yet soft, To strangers round that bed, who knew not aught Of the deep spells wherewith each word was fraught. To strangers?—Oh! could strangers raise the head Gently as hers was raised? Did strangers shed The kindly tears which bathed that feverish brow And wasted cheek with half-unconscious flow? Something was there, that through the lingering night Outwatches patiently the taper's light, Something that faints not through the day's distress, That fears not toil, that knows not weariness— Love, true, and perfect love! Whence came that power, Uprearing through the storm the drooping flower? Whence?—who can ask?—the wild delirium pass'd, And from her eyes the spirit look'd at last Into her mother's face, and wakening knew The brow's calm grace, the hair's dear silvery hue, The kind sweet smile of old!—and had she come, Thus in life's evening from her distant home, To save her child? Even so—nor yet in vain; In that young heart a light sprung up again, And lovely still, with so much love to give, Seem'd this fair world, though faded; still to live Was not to pine forsaken. On the breast That rock'd her childhood, sinking in soft rest, “Sweet mother! gentlest mother! can it be?” The lorn one cried, “and do I look on thee? Take back thy wanderer from this fatal shore, Peace shall be ours beneath our vines once more.” THE QUEEN OF PRUSSIA'S TOMB. “In sweet pride upon that insult keen She smiled; then drooping mute and brokenhearted, To the cold comfort of the grave departed.” Milman. It stands where northern willows weep, A temple fair and lone; Soft shadows o'er its marble sweep From cypress branches thrown; While silently around it spread, Thou feel'st the presence of the dead. And what within is richly shrined? A sculptured woman's form, Lovely, in perfect rest reclined, As one beyond the storm: Yet not of death, but slumber, lies The solemn sweetness on those eyes. The folded hands, the calm pure face, The mantle's quiet flow, The gentle, yet majestic grace, Throned on the matron brow; These in that scene of tender gloom, With a still glory robe the tomb. There stands an eagle, at the feet Of the fair image wrought; A kingly emblem—nor unmeet To wake yet deeper thought: She whose high heart finds rest below, Was royal in her birth and woe. There are pale garlands hung above, Of dying scent and hue: She was a mother—in her love How sorrowfully true! Oh! hallow'd long be every leaf, The record of her children's grief! She saw their birthright's warrior-crown Of olden glory spoil'd, The standard of their sires borne down, The shield's bright blazon soil'd: She met the tempest, meekly brave, Then turn'd o'erwearied to the grave. She slumber'd: but it came—it came, Her land's redeeming hour, With the glad shout, and signal flame Sent on from tower to tower! Fast through the realm a spirit moved— 'Twas hers, the lofty and the loved. Then was her name a note that wrung To rouse bold hearts from sleep; Her memory, as a banner flung Forth by the Baltic deep; Her grief, a bitter vial pour'd To sanctify th' avenger's sword. And the crown'd eagle spread again His pinion to the sun; And the strong land shook off its chain— So was the triumph won! But woe for earth, where sorrow's tone Still blends with victory's!—She was gone! THE MEMORIAL PILLAR. “Hast thou through Eden's wild-wood vales, pursued Each mountain scene magnificently rude, Nor with attention's lifted eye revered That modest stone, by pious Pembroke rear'd, Which still records, beyond the pencil's power, The silent sorrows of a parting hour?” Rogers. Mother and child! whose blending tears Have sanctified the place, Where, to the love of many years, Was given one last embrace— Oh! ye have shrined a spell of power, Deep in your record of that hour! A spell to waken solemn thought, A still, small under tone, That calls back days of childhood, fraught With many a treasure gone; And smites, perchance, the hidden source, Though long untroubled—of remorse. For who, that gazes on the stone Which marks your parting spot, Who but a mother's love hath known, The one love changing not? Alas! and haply learn'd its worth First with the sound of “Earth to earth. But thou, high-hearted daughter! thou, O'er whose bright, honour'd head, Blessings and tears of holiest flow, E'en here were fondly shed— Thou from the passion of thy grief, In its full burst, couldst draw relief. For, oh! though painful be th' excess, The might where with it swells, In nature's fount no bitterness Of nature's mingling dwells; And thou hadst not, by wrong or pride, Poison'd the free and healthful tide. But didst thou meet the face no more Which thy young heart first knew? And all—was all in this world o'er, With ties thus close and true? It was!—On earth no other eye Could give thee back thine infancy. No other voice could pierce the maze, Where deep, within thy breast, The sounds and dreams of other days With memory lay at rest; No other smile to thee could bring A gladd'ning, like the breath of spring. Yet, while thy place of weeping still Its lone memorial keeps, While on thy name, 'midst wood and hill, The quiet sunshine sleeps, And touches, in each graven line, Of reverential thought a sign; Can I, while yet these tokens wear The impress of the dead, Think of the love embodied there As of a vision fled? A perish'd thing, the joy and flower And glory of one earthly hour? Not so!—I will not bow me so To thoughts that breathe despair! A loftier faith we need below, Life's farewell words to bear. Mother and child!—your tears are past— Surely your hearts have met at last. THE GRAVE OF A POETESS. “Ne me plaignez pas—si vous saviez Combien de peines ce tombeau m'a epargnées!” I stood beside thy lowly grave; Spring odours breathed around, And music, in the river wave, Pass'd with a lulling sound. All happy things that love the sun, In the bright air glanced by, And a glad murmur seem'd to run Through the soft azure sky. Fresh leaves were on the ivy bough That fringed the ruins near; Young voices were abroad, but thou Their sweetness couldst not hear. And mournful grew my heart for thee, Thou in whose woman's mind The ray that brightens earth and sea, The light of song was shrined. Mournful, that thou wert slumbering low, With a dread curtain drawn Between thee and the golden glow Of this world's vernal dawn. Parted from all the song and bloom Thou wouldst have loved so well, To thee the sunshine round thy tomb Was but a broken spell. The bird, the insect on the wing, In their bright reckless play, Might feel the flush and life of spring— And thou wert pass'd away. But then, e'en then, a nobler thought O'er my vain sadness came; Th' immortal spirit woke, and wrought Within my thrilling frame. Surely on lovelier things, I said, Thou must have look'd ere now, Than all that round our pathway shed Odours and hues below. The shadows of the tomb are here, Yet beautiful is earth! What see'st thou then, where no dim fear, No haunting dream hath birth? Here a vain love to passing flowers Thou gav'st—but where thou art, The sway is not with changeful hours, There love and death must part. Thou hast left sorrow in thy song, A voice not loud but deep! The glorious bowers of earth among— How often didst thou weep? Where couldst thou fix on mortal ground Thy tender thoughts and high? Now peace the woman's heart hath found, And joy the poet's eye. MISCELLANEOUS PIECES. THE HOMES OF ENGLAND. “Where's the coward that would not dare To fight for such a land?” Marmion. The stately Homes of England, How beautiful they stand! Amidst their tall ancestral trees, O'er all the pleasant land. The deer across their greensward bound, Through shade and sunny gleam, And the swan glides past them with the sound Of some rejoicing stream. The merry Homes of England! Around their hearths by night, What gladsome looks of household love Meet in the ruddy light! There woman's voice flows forth in song, Or childhood's tale is told, Or lips move tunefully along Some glorious page of old. The blessed Homes of England! How softly on their bowers Is laid the holy quietness That breathes from Sabbath hours! Solemn, yet sweet, the church-bell's chime Floats through their woods at morn; All other sounds, in that still time, Of breeze and leaf are born. The Cottage Homes of England! By thousands on her plains, They are smiling o'er the silvery brooks, And round the hamlet fanes. Through glowing orchards forth they peep, Each from its nook of leaves, And fearless there the lowly sleep, As the bird beneath their eaves. The free, fair Homes of England! Long, long, in hut and hall, May hearts of native proof be rear'd To guard each hallow'd wall! And green for ever be the groves, And bright the flowery sod, Where first the child's glad spirit loves Its country and its God! THE SICILIAN CAPTIVE. “I have dreamt thou wert A captive in thy hopelessness; afar From the sweet home of thy young infancy, Whose image unto thee is as a dream Of fire and slaughter; I can see thee wasting, Sick for thy native air.” L. E. L. The champions had come from their fields of war, Over the crests of the billows far— They had brought back the spoils of a hundred shores, Where the deep had foam'd to their flashing oars. They sat at their feast round the Norse king's board; By the glare of the torch-light the mead was pour'd; The hearth was heap'd with the pine-boughs high, And it flung a red radiance on shields thrown by. The Scalds that chanted in Runic rhyme Their songs of the sword and the olden time; And a solemn thrill, as the harp-chords rung, Had breathed from the walls where the bright spears hung. But the swell was gone from the quivering string, They had summon'd a softer voice to sing, And a captive girl, at the warriors' call, Stood forth in the midst of that frowning hall. Lonely she stood:—in her mournful eyes Lay the clear midnight of southern skies; And the drooping fringe of their lashes low, Half-veil'd a depth of unfathom'd woe. Stately she stood—though her fragile frame Seem'd struck with the blight of some inward flame And her proud pale brow had a shade of scorn, Under the waves of her dark hair worn. And a deep flush pass'd, like a crimson haze, O'er her marble cheek by the pine-fire's blaze; No soft hue caught from the south wind's breath, But a token of fever, at strife with death. She had been torn from her home away, With her long locks crown'd for her bridal-day, And brought to die of the burning dreams That haunt the exile by foreign streams. They bade her sing of her distant land— She held its lyre with a trembling hand, Till the spirit its blue skies had given her, woke, And the stream of her voice into music broke. Faint was the strain, in its first wild flow; Troubled its murmur, and sad, and low; But it swell'd into deeper power erelong, As the breeze that swept o'er her soul grew strong. “They bid me sing of thee, mine own, my sunny land! of thee! Am I not parted from thy shores by the mournful sounding sea? Doth not thy shadow wrap my soul?—in silence let me die, In a voiceless dream of thy silvery founts, and thy pure, deep sapphire sky; How should thy lyre give here its wealth of buried sweetness forth? Its tones of summer's breathings born, to the wild winds of the north? “Yet thus it shall be once, once more!—my spirit shall awake, And through the mists of death shine out, my country, for thy sake! That I may make thee known, with all the beauty and the light, And the glory never more to bless thy daughter's yearning sight! Thy woods shall whisper in my song, thy bright streams warble by, Thy soul flow o'er my lips again—yet once, my Sicily! “There are blue heavens—far hence, far hence! but, oh! their glorious blue! Its very night is beautiful, with the hyacinth's deep hue! It is above my own fair land, and round my laughing home, And arching o'er my vintage hills, they hang their cloudless dome; And making all the waves as gems, that melt along the shore, And steeping happy hearts in joy—that now is mine no more. “And there are haunts in that green land—oh! who may dream or tell Of all the shaded loveliness it hides in grot and dell! By fountains flinging rainbow-spray on dark and glossy leaves, And bowers wherein the forest dove her nest untroubled weaves; The myrtle dwells there, sending round the richness of its breath, And the violets gleam like amethysts, from the dewy moss beneath. “And there are floating sounds that fill the skies through night and day— Sweet sounds! the soul to hear them faints in dreams of heaven away! They wander through the olive woods, and o'er the shining seas— They mingle with the orange scents that load the sleepy breeze; Lute, voice, and bird, are blending there;—it were a bliss to die, As dies a leaf, thy groves among, my flowery Sicily! “I may not thus depart—farewell! yet no, my country! no! Is not love stronger than the grave? I feel it must be so! My fleeting spirit shall o'ersweep the mountains and the main, And in thy tender starlight rove, and through thy woods again. Its passion deepens—it prevails!—I break my chain— I come To dwell a viewless thing, yet blest—in thy sweet air, my home!” And her pale arms dropp'd the ringing lyre— There came a mist o'er her eye's wild fire— And her dark rich tresses, in many a fold, Loosed from their braids, down her bosom roll'd. For her head sank back on the rugged wall— A silence fell o'er the warriors' hall; She had pour'd out her soul with her song's last tone; The lyre was broken, the minstrel gone! IVAN THE CZAR. “Gieb diesen Todten mir heraus. Ich muss Ihn wieder haben! Trostlose Allmacht, Die nicht einmal in Gräber ihren arm Verlängern, eine kleine Übereilung Mit Menschenleben nicht verbessern kann!” Schiller. He sat in silence on the ground, The old and haughty Czar, Lonely, though princes girt him round, And leaders of the war: He had cast his jewell'd sabre, That many a field had won, To the earth beside his youthful dead— His fair and first-born son. With a robe of ermine for its bed, Was laid that form of clay, Where the light a stormy sunset shed, Through the rich tent made way; And a sad and solemn beauty On the pallid face came down, Which the Lord of nations mutely watch'd, In the dust, with his renown. Low tones, at last, of woe and fear From his full bosom broke— A mournful thing it was to hear How then the proud man spoke! The voice that through the combat Had shouted far and high, Came forth in strange, dull, hollow tones, Burden'd with agony. “There is no crimson on thy cheek, And on thy lip no breath; I call thee, and thou dost not speak— They tell me this is death! And fearful things are whispering That I the deed have done— For the honour of thy father's name, Look up, look up, my son! “Well might I know death's hue and mien, But on thine aspect, boy! What, till this moment, have I seen Save pride and tameless joy? Swiftest thou wert to battle, And bravest there of all— How could I think a warrior's frame Thus like a flower should fall? “I will not bear that still cold look— Rise up, thou fierce and free! Wake as the storm wakes! I will brook All, save this calm, from thee! Lift brightly up, and proudly, Once more thy kindling eyes! Hath my word lost its power on earth? I say to thee, arise! “Didst thou not know I loved thee well? Thou didst not! and art gone, In bitterness of soul, to dwell Where man must dwell alone. Come back, young fiery spirit! If but one hour, to learn The secrets of the folded heart That seem'd to thee so stern. “Thou wert the first, the first, fair child That in mine arms I press'd: Thou wert the bright one, that hast smiled Like summer on my breast! I rear'd thee as an eagle, To the chase thy steps I led, I bore thee on my battle-horse, I look upon thee—dead! “Lay down my warlike banners here, Never again to wave, And bury my red sword and spear, Chiefs! in my first-born's grave! And leave me!—I have conquer'd, I have slain—my work is done! Whom have I slain?—ye answer not— Thou too art mute, my son!” And thus his wild lament was pour'd Through the dark resounding night, And the battle knew no more his sword, Nor the foaming steed his might. He heard strange voices moaning In every wind that sigh'd; From the searching stars of heaven he shrank— Humbly the conqueror died. CAROLAN'S PROPHECY. Founded on the following circumstance related in the Percy Anecdotes of imagination. “It is somewhat remarkable that Carolan, the Irish bard, even in his gayest mood, never could compose a planxty for a Miss Brett, in the county of Sligo, whose father's house he frequented, and where he always met with a reception due to his exquisite taste and mental endowments. One day, after an unsuccessful attempt to compose something in a sprightly strain for this lady, he threw aside his harp with a mixture of rage and grief; and addressing himself in Irish to her mother, “Madam,” said he, “I have often, from my great respect to your family, attempted a planxty in order to celebrate your daughter's perfections, but to no purpose. Some evil genius hovers over me; there is not a string in my harp that does not vibrate a melancholy sound when I set about this task. I fear she is not doomed to remain long among us; ‘nay,’ said he, emphatically, ‘she will not survive twelve months.’ The event verified the prediction, and the young lady died within the period limited by the unconsciously prophetic bard.” Thy cheek too swiftly flushes, o'er thine eye The lights and shadows come and go too fast; Thy tears gush forth too soon, and in thy voice Are sounds of tenderness too passionate For peace on earth; oh! therefore, child of song! 'Tis well thou shouldst depart. A sound of music, from amidst the hills, Came suddenly, and died; a fitful sound Of mirth, soon lost in wail.—Again it rose, And sank in mournfulness.—There sat a bard By a blue stream of Erin, where it swept Flashing through rock and wood; the sunset's light Was on its wavy, silver-gleaming hair, And the wind's whisper in the mountain-ash, Whose clusters droop'd above. His head was bow'd, His hand was on his harp, yet thence its touch Had drawn but broken strains; and many stood, Waiting around in silent earnestness, Th' unchaining of his soul, the gush of song— Many and graceful forms!—yet one alone Seem'd present to his dream; and she, indeed, With her pale, virgin brow, and changeful cheek, And the clear starlight of her serious eyes, Lovely amidst the flowing of dark locks And pallid braiding flowers, was beautiful, E'en painfully!—a creature to behold With trembling 'midst our joy, lest aught unseen Should waft the vision from us, leaving earth Too dim without its brightness!—Did such fear O'ershadow in that hour the gifted one, By his own rushing stream?—Once more he gazed Upon the radiant girl, and yet once more From the deep chords his wandering hand brought out A few short festive notes, an opening strain Of bridal melody, soon dash'd with grief, As if some wailing spirit in the strings Met and o'ermaster'd him; but yielding then To the strong prophet-impulse, mournfully, Like moaning waters o'er the harp he pour'd The trouble of his haunted soul, and sang— Voice of the grave! I hear thy thrilling call; It comes in the dash of the foaming wave, In the sere-leaf's trembling fall! In the shiver of the tree, I hear thee, O thou voice! And I would thy warning were but for me, That my spirit might rejoice. But thou art sent For the sad earth's young and fair, For the graceful heads that have not bent To the wintry hand of care! They hear the wind's low sigh, And the river sweeping free, And the green reeds murmuring heavily, And the woods—but they hear not thee! Long have I striven With my deep foreboding soul, But the full tide now its bounds hath riven, And darkly on must roll. There's a young brow smiling near, With a bridal white rose wreath— Unto me it smiles from a flowery bier, Touch'd solemnly by death! Fair art thou, Morna! The sadness of thine eye Is beautiful as silvery clouds On the dark blue summer sky! And thy voice comes like the sound Of a sweet and hidden rill, That makes the dim woods tuneful round— But soon it must be still! Silence and dust On thy sunny lips must lie— Make not the strength of love thy trust, A stronger yet is nigh! No strain of festal flow That my hand for thee hath tried, But into dirge notes wild and low Its ringing tones have died. Young art thou, Morna! Yet on thy gentle head, Like heavy dew on the lily's leaves, A spirit hath been shed! And the glance is thine which sees Through nature's awful heart— But bright things go with the summer breeze, And thou too must depart! Yet shall I weep? I know that in thy breast There swells a fount of song too deep, Too powerful for thy rest! And the bitterness I know, And the chill of this world's breath— Go, all undimm'd, in thy glory go! Young and crown'd bride of death! Take hence to heaven Thy holy thoughts and bright, And soaring hopes, that were not given For the touch of mortal blight! Might we follow in thy track, This parting should not be! But the spring shall give us violets back, And every flower but thee! There was a burst of tears around the bard: All wept but one, and she serenely stood, With her clear brow and dark religious eye Raised to the first faint star above the hills, And cloudless; though it might be that her cheek Was paler than before.—So Morna heard The minstrel's prophecy. And spring return'd, Bringing the earth her lovely things again, All, save the loveliest far! A voice, a smile, A young sweet spirit gone. THE LADY OF THE CASTLE. FROM THE “PORTRAIT GALLERY,” AN UNFINISHED POEM. If there be but one spot upon thy name, One eye thou fear'st to meet, one human voice Whose tones thou shrink'st from—Woman! veil thy face, And bow thy head—and die! Thou see'st her pictured with her shining hair, (Famed were those tresses in Provencal song,) Half braided, half o'er cheek and bosom fair Let loose, and pouring sunny waves along Her gorgeous vest. A child's light hand is roving 'Midst the rich curls; and, oh! how meekly loving Its earnest looks are lifted to the face Which bends to meet its lip in laughing grace! Yet that bright lady's eye, methinks, hath less Of deep, and still, and pensive tenderness, Than might beseem a mother's;—on her brow Something too much there sits of native scorn, And her smile kindles with a conscious glow, As from the thought of sovereign beauty born. These may be dreams—but how shall woman tell Of woman's shame, and not with tears?—She fell! That mother left that child!—went hurrying by Its cradle—haply not without a sigh, Haply one moment o'er its rest serene She hung—but no! it could not thus have been, For she went on!—forsook her home, her hearth, All pure affection, all sweet household mirth, To live a gaudy and dishonour'd thing, Sharing in guilt the splendours of a king. Her lord, in very weariness of life, Girt on his sword for scenes of distant strife; He reck'd no more of glory:—grief and shame Crush'd out his fiery nature, and his name Died silently. A shadow o'er his halls Crept year by year; the minstrel pass'd their walls; The warder's horn hung mute:—mean time the child On whose first flowering thoughts no parent smiled, A gentle girl, and yet deep-hearted, grew Into sad youth; for well, too well, she knew Her mother's tale! Its memory made the sky Seem all too joyous for her shrinking eye; Check'd on her lip the flow of song, which fain Would there have linger'd; flush'd her cheek to pain, If met by sudden glance; and gave a tone Of sorrow, as for something lovely gone, E'en to the spring's glad voice. Her own was low And plaintive.—Oh! there lie such depths of woe In a young blighted spirit! Manhood rears A haughty brow, and age has done with tears; But youth bows down to misery, in amaze At the dark cloud o'ermantling its fresh days— And thus it was with her. A mournful sight In one so fair—forshe indeed was fair— Not with her mother's dazzling eyes of light, Hers were more shadowy, full of thought and prayer, And with long lashes o'er a white rose cheek, Drooping in gloom, yet tender still and meek, Still that fond child's—and oh! the brow above So pale and pure! so form'd for holy love To gaze upon in silence!—But she felt That love was not for her, though hearts would melt Where'er she moved, and reverence mutely given Went with her; and low prayers, that call'd on Heaven To bless the young Isaure. One sunny morn With alms before her castle gate she stood, 'Midst peasant groups; when, breathless and o'erworn, And shrouded in long weeds of widowhood, A stranger through them broke:—the orphan maid, With her sweet voice and proffer'd hand of aid, Turn'd to give welcome; but a wild sad look Met hers—a gaze that all her spirit shook; And that pale woman, suddenly subdued By some strong passion, in its gushing mood, Knelt at her feet, and bathed them with such tears As rain the hoarded agonies of years From the heart's urn; and with her white lips press'd The ground they trod; then, burying in her vest Her brow's deep flush, sobb'd out—“Oh! undefiled! I am thy mother—spurn me not, my child!” Isaure had pray'd for that lost mother; wept O'er her stain'd memory, while the happy slept In the hush'd midnight: stood with mournful gaze Before yon picture's smile of other days, But never breathed in human ear the name Which weigh'd her being to the earth with shame. What marvel if the anguish, the surprise, The dark remembrances, the alter'd guise, Awhile o'erpower'd her?—from the weeper's touch She shrank—'twas but a moment—yet too much For that all-humbled one; its mortal stroke Came down like lightning, and her full heart broke At once in silence. Heavily and prone She sank, while o'er her castle's threshold stone, Those long fair tresses—they still brightly wore Their early pride, though bound with pearls no more— Bursting their fillet, in sad beauty roll'd, And swept the dust with coils of wavy gold. Her child bent o'er her—call'd her—'twas too late— Dead lay the wanderer at her own proud gate! The joy of courts, the star of knight and bard— How didst thou fall, O bright-hair'd Ermengarde! THE MOURNER FOR THE BARMECIDES. “O good old man! how well in thee appears The constant service of the antique world! Thou art not for the fashion of these times.” As You Like It. Fallen was the House of Giafar; and its name, The high romantic name of Barmecide, A sound forbidden on its own bright shores, By the swift Tigris' wave. Stern Haroun's wrath, Sweeping the mighty with their fame away, Had so pass'd sentence: but man's chainless heart Hides that within its depths which never yet Th' oppressor's thought could reach. 'Twas desolate Where Giafar's halls, beneath the burning sun, Spread out in ruin lay. The songs had ceased; The lights, the perfumes, and the genii tales Had ceased; the guests were gone. Yet still one voice Was there—the fountain's; through those eastern courts, Over the broken marble and the grass, Its low clear music shedding mournfully. And still another voice!—an aged man, Yet with a dark and fervent eye beneath His silvery hair, came day by day, and sate On a white column's fragment; and drew forth, From the forsaken walls and dim arcades, A tone that shook them with its answering thrill To his deep accents. Many a glorious tale He told that sad yet stately solitude, Pouring his memory's fulness o'er its gloom. Like waters in the waste; and calling up, By song or high recital of their deeds, Bright solemn shadows of its vanish'd race To people their own halls: with these alone, In all this rich and breathing world, his thoughts Held still unbroken converse. He had been Rear'd in this lordly dwelling, and was now The ivy of its ruins, unto which His fading life seem'd bound. Day roll'd on day, And from that scene the loneliness was fled; For crowds around the grey-hair'd chronicler Met as men meet, within whose anxious hearts Fear with deep feeling strives; till, as a breeze Wanders through forest branches, and is met By one quick sound and shiver of the leaves, The spirit of his passionate lament, As through their stricken souls it pass'd awoke One echoing murmur.—But this might not be Under a despot's rule, and, summon'd thence, The dreamer stood before the Caliph's throne: Sentenced to death he stood, and deeply pale, And with his white lips rigidly compress'd; Till, in submissive tones, he ask'd to speak Once more, ere thrust from earth's fair sunshine forth. Was it to sue for grace?—His burning heart Sprang, with a sudden lightning, to his eye, And he was changed!—and thus, in rapid words, Th' o'ermastering thoughts, more strong than death, found way. “And shall I not rejoice to go, when the noble and the brave, With the glory on their brows, are gone before me to the grave? What is there left to look on now, what brightness in the land? I hold in scorn the faded world, that wants their princely band! “My chiefs! my chiefs! the old man comes that in your halls was nursed— That follow'd you to many a fight, where flash'd your sabres first— That bore your children in his arms, your name upon his heart:— Oh! must the music of that name with him from earth depart? “It shall not be! a thousand tongues, though human voice were still, With that high sound the living air triumphantly shall fill; The wind's free flight shall bear it on as wandering seeds are sown, And the starry midnight whisper it, with a deep and thrilling tone. “For it is not as a flower whose scent with the dropping leaves expires, And it is not as a household lamp, that a breath should quench its fires; It is written on our battle-fields with the writing of the sword, It hath left upon our desert sands a light in blessings pour'd. “The founts, the many gushing founts, which to the wild ye gave, Of you, my chiefs, shall sing aloud, as they pour a joyous wave! And the groves, with whose deep lovely gloom ye hung the pilgrim's way, Shall send from all their sighing leaves your praises on the day. “The very walls your bounty rear'd for the stranger's homeless head, Shall find a murmur to record your tale, my glorious dead! Though the grass be where ye feasted once, where lute and cittern rung, And the serpent in your palaces lie coil'd amidst its young. “It is enough! mine eye no more of joy or splendour sees— I leave your name in lofty faith, to the skies and to the breeze! I go, since earth her flower hath lost, to join the bright and fair, And call the grave a kingly house, for ye, my chiefs, are there!” But while the old man sang, a mist of tears O'er Haroun's eyes had gather'd, and a thought— Oh! many a sudden and remorseful thought— Of his youth's once loved friends, the martyr'd race, O'erflow'd his softening heart.—“Live! live!” he cried, “Thou faithful unto death! live on, and still Speak of thy lords—they were a princely band!” THE SPANISH CHAPEL. Suggested by a scene beautifully described in the Recollections of the Peninsula. “Weep not for those whom the veil of the tomb, In life's early morning, hath hid from our eyes, Ere sin threw a veil o'er the spirit's young bloom, Or earth had profaned what was born for the skies.” Moore. I made a mountain brook my guide Through a wild Spanish glen, And wander'd on its grassy side, Far from the homes of men. It lured me with a singing tone, And many a sunny glance, To a green spot of beauty lone, A haunt for old romance. A dim and deeply bosom'd grove Of many an aged tree, Such as the shadowy violets love, The fawn and forest bee. The darkness of the chestnut-bough There on the waters lay, The bright stream reverently below Check'd its exulting play; And bore a music all subdued, And led a silvery sheen On through the breathing solitude Of that rich leafy scene. For something viewlessly around Of solemn influence dwelt, In the soft gloom and whispery sound, Not to be told, but felt; While sending forth a quiet gleam Across the wood's repose, And o'er the twilight of the stream, A lowly chapel rose. A pathway to that still retreat Through many a myrtle wound, And there a sight—how strangely sweet! My steps in wonder bound, For on a brilliant bed of flowers, E'en at the threshold made, As if to sleep through sultry hours, A young fair child was laid. To sleep?—oh! ne'er on childhood's eye And silken lashes press'd, Did the warm living slumber lie With such a weight of rest! Yet still a tender crimson glow Its cheek's pure marble dyed— 'Twas but the light's faint streaming flow Through roses heap'd beside. I stoop'd—the smooth round arm was chill, The soft lip's breath was fled, And the bright ringlets hung so still— The lovely child was dead! “Alas!” I cried, “fair faded thing! Thou hast wrung bitter tears, And thou hast left a woe, to cling Round yearning hearts for years!” But then a voice came sweet and low— I turn'd, and near me sate A woman with a mourner's brow, Pale, yet not desolate. And in her still, clear, matron face, All solemnly serene, A shadow'd image I could trace Of that young slumberer's mien. “Stranger! thou pitiest me,” she said With lips that faintly smiled, “As here I watch beside my dead, My fair and precious child. “But know, the time-worn heart may be By pangs in this world riven, Keener than theirs who yield, like me, An angel thus to Heaven!” THE KAISER'S FEAST. The Kaiser feasted in his hall— The red wine mantled high; Banners were trembling on the wall, To the peals of minstrelsy: And many a gleam and sparkle came From the armour hung around, As it caught the glance of the torch's flame, Or the hearth with pine-boughs crown'd. Why fell there silence on the chord Beneath the harper's hand? And suddenly from that rich board, Why rose the wassail band? The strings were hush'd—the knights made way For the queenly mother's tread, As up the hall, in dark array, Two fair-hair'd boys she led. She led them e'en to the Kaiser's place, And still before him stood; Till, with strange wonder, o'er his face Flush'd the proud warrior blood: And “Speak, my mother! speak!” he cried, “Wherefore this mourning vest? And the clinging children by thy side, In weeds of sadness drest?” “Well may a mourning vest be mine, And theirs, my son, my son! Look on the features of thy line In each fair little one! Though grief awhile within their eyes Hath tamed the dancing glee, Yet there thine own quick spirit lies— Thy brother's children see! “And where is he, thy brother, where? He in thy home that grew, And smiling, with his sunny hair, Ever to greet thee flew? How would his arms thy neck entwine, His fond lips press thy brow! My son! oh, call these orphans thine!— Thou hast no brother now! “What! from their gentle eyes doth nought Speak of thy childhood's hours, And smite thee with a tender thought Of thy dead father's towers? Kind was thy boyish heart and true, When rear'd together there, Through the old woods like fawns ye flew— Where is thy brother—where? “Well didst thou love him then, and he Still at thy side was seen! How is it that such things can be As though they ne'er had been? Evil was this world's breath, which came Between the good and brave! Now must the tears of grief and shame Be offer'd to the grave. “And let them, let them there be pour'd! Though all unfelt below— Thine own wrung heart, to love restored, Shall soften as they flow. Oh! death is mighty to make peace; Now bid his work be done! So many an inward strife shall cease— Take, take these babes, my son!” His eye was dimm'd—the strong man shook With feelings long suppress'd; Up in his arms the boys he took, And strain'd them to his breast. And a shout from all in the royal hall Burst forth to hail the sight; And eyes were wet 'midst the brave that met At the Kaiser's feast that night. TASSO AND HIS SISTER. “Devant vous est Sorrente; là démeuroit la sœur de Tasse, quand il vint en pélérin demander à cette obscure amie, un asyle contre l'injustice des princes.—Ses longues douleurs avaient presque egaré sa raison; il ne lui restoit plus que son génie.”—Corinne. She sat, where on each wind that sigh'd, The citron's breath went by, While the red gold of eventide Burn'd in the Italian sky. Her bower was one where daylight's close Full of sweet laughter found, As thence the voice of childhood rose To the high vineyards round. But still and thoughtful, at her knee, Her children stood that hour, Their bursts of song and dancing glee Hush'd as by words of power. With bright fix'd wondering eyes, that gazed Up to their mother's face, With brows through parted ringlets raised They stood in silent grace. While she—yet something o'er her look Of mournfulness was spread— Forth from a poet's magic book The glorious numbers read; The proud undying lay, which pour'd Its light on evil years; His of the gifted pen and sword, It is scarcely necessary to recall the well-known Italian saying, that Tasso, with his sword and pen, was superior to all men. The triumph—and the tears. She read of fair Erminia's flight, Which Venice once might hear Sung on her glittering seas at night By many a gondolier; Of him she read, who broke the charm That wrapt the myrtle grove; Of Godfrey's deeds, of Tancred's arm, That slew his Paynim love. Young cheeks around that bright page glow'd, Young holy hearts were stirr'd; And the meek tears of woman flow'd Fast o'er each burning word. And sounds of breeze, and fount, and leaf, Came sweet, each pause between; When a strange voice of sudden grief Burst on the gentle scene. The mother turn'd—a way-worn man, In pilgrim garb, stood nigh, Of stately mien, yet wild and wan, Of proud yet mournful eye. But drops which would not stay for pride, From that dark eye gush'd free, As pressing his pale brow, he cried, “Forgotten! e'en by thee! “Am I so changed?—and yet we two Oft hand in hand have play'd;— This brow hath been all bathed in dew, From wreaths which thou hast made; We have knelt down and said one prayer, And sung one vesper strain; My soul is dim with clouds of care— Tell me those words again! “Life hath been heavy on my head, I come a stricken deer, Bearing the heart, 'midst crowds that bled, To bleed in stillness here.” She gazed, till thoughts that long had slept Shook all her thrilling frame— She fell upon his neck and wept, Murmuring her brother's name. Her brother's name!—and who was he, The weary one, th' unknown, That came, the bitter world to flee, A stranger to his own?— He was the bard of gifts divine To sway the souls of men; He of the song for Salem's shrine, He of the sword and pen! ULLA, OR THE ADJURATION. “Yet speak to me! I have outwatch'd the stars, And gazed o'er heaven in vain, in search of thee. Speak to me! I have wander'd o'er the earth, And never found thy likeness. Speak to me! This once—once more!” Manfred. “Thou'rt gone!—thou'rt slumbering low, With the sounding seas above thee; It is but a restless woe, But a haunting dream to love thee! Thrice the glad swan has sung, To greet the spring-time hours, Since thine oar at parting flung The white spray up in showers. There's a shadow of the grave on thy hearth and round thy home; Come to me from the ocean's dead!—thou'rt surely of them—come!” 'Twas Ulla's voice—alone she stood In the Iceland summer night, Far gazing o'er a glassy flood, From a dark rock's beetling height. “I know thou hast thy bed Where the sea-weed's coil hath bound thee; The storm sweeps o'er thy head, But the depths are hush'd around thee. What wind shall point the way To the chambers where thou'rt lying? Come to me thence, and say If thou thought'st on me in dying? I will not shrink to see thee with a bloodless lip and cheek— Come to me from the ocean's dead!—thou'rt surely of them—speak!” She listen'd—'twas the wind's low moan, 'Twas the ripple of the wave, 'Twas the wakening osprey's cry alone, As it startled from its cave. “I know each fearful spell Of the ancient Runic lay, Whose mutter'd words compel The tempest to obey. But I adjure not thee By magic sign or song— My voice shall stir the sea By love—the deep, the strong! By the might of woman's tears, by the passion of her sighs, Come to me from the ocean's dead!—by the vows we pledged—arise!” Again she gazed with an eager glance, Wandering and wildly bright;— She saw but the sparkling waters dance To the arrowy northern light. “By the slow and struggling death Of hope that loathed to part, By the fierce and withering breath Of despair on youth's high heart— By the weight of gloom which clings To the mantle of the night, By the heavy dawn which brings Nought lovely to the sight— By all that from my weary soul thou hast wrung of grief and fear— Come to me from the ocean's dead—awake, arise, appear!” Was it her yearning spirit's dream, Or did a pale form rise, And o'er the hush'd wave glide and gleam, With bright, still, mournful eyes? “Have the depths heard?—they have! My voice prevails—thou'rt there, Dim from thy watery grave— O thou that wert so fair! Yet take me to thy rest! There dwells no fear with love; Let me slumber on thy breast, While the billow rolls above! Where the long lost things lie hid, where the bright ones have their home, We will sleep among the ocean's dead—stay for me, stay!—I come!” There was a sullen plunge below, A flashing on the main; And the wave shut o'er that wild heart's woe, Shut, and grew still again. TO WORDSWORTH. Thine is a strain to read among the hills, The old and full of voices;—by the source Of some free stream, whose gladd'ning presence fills The solitude with sound; for in its course Even such is thy deep song, that seems a part Of those high scenes, a fountain from their heart. Or its calm spirit fitly may be taken To the still breast, in sunny garden bowers, Where vernal winds each tree's low tones awaken, And bud and bell with changes mark the hours. There let thy thoughts be with me, while the day Sinks with a golden and serene decay. Or by some hearth where happy faces meet, When night hath hush'd the woods, with all their birds, There, from some gentle voice, that lay were sweet As antique music, link'd with household words; While, in pleased murmurs, woman's lip might move, And the raised eye of childhood shine in love. Or where the shadows of dark solemn yews Brood silently o'er some lone burial-ground, Thy verse hath power that brightly might diffuse A breath, a kindling, as of spring, around; From its own glow of hope and courage high, And steadfast faith's victorious constancy. True bard and holy!—thou art e'en as one Who, by some secret gift of soul or eye, In every spot beneath the smiling sun, Sees where the springs of living waters lie: Unseen awhile they sleep—till, touch'd by thee, Bright healthful waves flow forth to each glad wanderer free. A MONARCH'S DEATHBED. A monarch on his deathbed lay— Did censers waft perfume, And soft lamps pour their silvery ray, Through his proud chamber's gloom? He lay upon a greensward bed, Beneath a darkening sky— A lone tree waving o'er his head, A swift stream rolling by. Had he then fallen as warriors fall, Where spear strikes fire with spear? Was there a banner for his pall, A buckler for his bier? Not so—nor cloven shields nor helms Had strewn the bloody sod, Where he, the helpless lord of realms, Yielded his soul to God. Were there not friends with words of cheer, And princely vassals nigh? And priests, the crucifix to rear Before the glazing eye? A peasant girl that royal head Upon her bosom laid, And, shrinking not for woman's dread, The face of death survey'd. Alone she sat:—from hill and wood Red sank the mournful sun; Fast gush'd the fount of noble blood— Treason its worst had done. With her long hair she vainly press'd The wounds, to stanch their tide— Unknown, on that meek humble breast, Imperial Albert died! TO THE MEMORY OF HEBER. “Umile in tanta gloria.” Petrarch. If it be sad to speak of treasures gone, Of sainted genius call'd too soon away, Of light from this world taken, while it shone Yet kindling onward to the perfect day— How shall our grief, if mournful these things be, Flow forth, O thou of many gifts! for thee? Hath not thy voice been here amongst us heard? And that deep soul of gentleness and power, Have we not felt its breath in every word, Wont from thy lip, as Hermon's dew, to shower? Yes, in our hearts thy fervent thoughts have burn'd— Of heaven they were, and thither have return'd. How shall we mourn thee?—With a lofty trust, Our life's immortal birthright from above! With a glad faith, whose eye, to track the just, Through shades and mysteries lifts a glance of love, And yet can weep!—for nature thus deplores The friend that leaves us, though for happier shores. And one high tone of triumph o'er thy bier, One strain of solemn rapture be allow'd! Thou, that rejoicing on thy mid career, Not to decay, but unto death hast bow'd; In those bright regions of the rising sun, Where victory ne'er a crown like thine had won. Praise! for yet one more name with power endow'd, To cheer and guide us, onward as we press; Yet one more image on the heart bestow'd To dwell there, beautiful in holiness! Thine, Heber, thine; whose memory from the dead, Shines as the star which to the Saviour led! St Asaph, Sept. 1826. THE ADOPTED CHILD. “Why wouldst thou leave me, O gentle child? Thy home on the mountain is bleak and wild, A straw-roof'd cabin, with lowly wall— Mine is a fair and a pillar'd hall, Where many an image of marble gleams, And the sunshine of picture for ever streams.” “Oh! green is the turf where my brothers play, Through the long bright hours of the summer day; They find the red cup-moss where they climb, And they chase the bee o'er the scented thyme, And the rocks where the heath-flower blooms they know— Lady, kind lady! O, let me go.” “Content thee, boy! in my bower to dwell, Here are sweet sounds which thou lovest well; Flutes on the air in the stilly noon, Harps which the wandering breezes tune, And the silvery wood-note of many a bird, Whose voice was ne'er in thy mountains heard.” “Oh! my mother sings, at the twilight's fall, A song of the hills far more sweet than all; She sings it under our own green tree, To the babe half slumbering on her knee; I dreamt last night of that music low— Lady, kind lady! O, let me go.” “Thy mother is gone from her cares to rest, She hath taken the babe on her quiet breast; Thou would'st meet her footstep, my boy, no more, Nor hear her song at the cabin door. Come thou with me to the vineyards nigh, And we'll pluck the grapes of the richest dye.” “Is my mother gone from her home away?— But I know that my brothers are there at play— I know they are gathering the foxglove's bell, Or the long fern leaves by the sparkling well; Or they launch their boats where the bright streams flow— Lady, kind lady! O, let me go.” “Fair child, thy brothers are wanderers now, They sport no more on the mountain's brow; They have left the fern by the spring's green side, And the streams where the fairy barks were tried. Be thou at peace in thy brighter lot, For thy cabin home is a lonely spot.” “Are they gone, all gone from the sunny hill?— But the bird and the blue-fly rove o'er it still; And the red-deer bound in their gladness free, And the heath is bent by the singing bee, And the waters leap, and the fresh winds blow—, Lady, kind lady! O, let me go.” INVOCATION. “I call'd on dreams and visions, to disclose That which is veil'd from waking thought; conjured Eternity, as men constrain a ghost To appear and answer.” Wordsworth. Answer me, burning stars of night! Where is the spirit gone, That past the reach of human sight, As a swift breeze hath flown?— And the stars answer'd me—“We roll In light and power on high; But, of the never-dying soul, Ask that which cannot die.” Oh! many-toned and chainless wind! Thou art a wanderer free; Tell me if thou its place canst find, Far over mount and sea? And the wind murmur'd in reply— “The blue deep I have cross'd, And met its barks and billows high, But not what thou hast lost.” Ye clouds, that gorgeously repose Around the setting sun, Answer! have ye a home for those Whose earthly race is run? The bright clouds answer'd—“We depart, We vanish from the sky; Ask what is deathless in thy heart, For that which cannot die.” Speak then, thou voice of God within, Thou of the deep, low tone! Answer me, through life's restless din, Where is the spirit flown? And the voice answer'd—“Be thou still! Enough to know is given; Clouds, winds, and stars their part fulfil, Thine is to trust in Heaven.” KÖRNER AND HIS SISTER. Green wave the oak for ever o'er thy rest, Thou that beneath its crowning foliage sleepest, And, in the stillness of thy country's breast, Thy place of memory as an altar keepest; Brightly thy spirit o'er her hills was pour'd, Thou of the Lyre and Sword! Rest, bard! rest, soldier!—by the father's hand Here shall the child of after years be led, With his wreath-offering silently to stand In the hush'd presence of the glorious dead. Soldier and bard! for thou thy path hast trod With freedom and with God. The oak waved proudly o'er thy burial rite, On thy crown'd bier to slumber warriors bore thee, And with true hearts thy brethren of the fight Wept as they veil'd their drooping banners o'er thee; And the deep guns with rolling peal gave token, That Lyre and Sword were broken. Thou hast a hero's tomb:—a lowlier bed Is hers, the gentle girl beside thee lying— The gentle girl, that bow'd her fair young head When thou wert gone, in silent sorrow dying. Brother, true friend! the tender and the brave— She pined to share thy grave. Fame was thy gift from others;—but for her, To whom the wide world held that only spot, She loved thee!—lovely in your lives ye were, And in your early deaths divided not. Thou hast thine oak, thy trophy:—What hath she? Her own bless'd place by thee! It was thy spirit, brother, which had made The bright earth glorious to her youthful eye, Since first in childhood 'midst the vines ye play'd, And sent glad singing through the free blue sky. Ye were but two—and when that spirit pass'd, Woe to the one, the last! Woe, yet not long!—She linger'd but to trace Thine image from the image in her breast— Once, once again to see that buried face But smile upon her, ere she went to rest. Too sad a smile! its living light was o'er— It answer'd hers no more. The earth grew silent when thy voice departed, The home too lonely whence thy step had fled; What then was left for her the faithful-hearted? Death, death, to still the yearning for the dead! Softly she perish'd:—be the Flower deplored Here with the Lyre and Sword! Have ye not met ere now?—so let those trust That meet for moments but to part for years— That weep, watch, pray, to hold back dust from dust— That love, where love is but a fount of tears. Brother, sweet sister! peace around ye dwell: Lyre, Sword, and Flower, farewell! The following lines, recently addressed to the author of the above, by the venerable father of Körner, who, with the mother, still survives the “Lyre, Sword, and Flower,” here commemorated, may not be uninteresting to the German reader. Wohllaut tönt aus der Ferne von freundlichen Lüften getragen, Schmeichelt mit lindernder Kraft sich in der Trauernden Ohr, Stärkt den erhebenden Glauben an solcher Seelen Verwandschaft, Die zum Tempel die Brust nur für das Würdige weihn. Aus dem Lande zu dem sich stets der gefeyerte Jungling Hingezogen gefühlt, wird ihm ein gläzender Lohn. Heil dem Brittischen Volke, wenn ihm das Deutsche nicht fremd ist! Über Länder und Meer reichen sich beyde die Hand. Theodor Körner's Vater. THE DEATH-DAY OF KÖRNER. On reading part of a letter from Körner's father, addressed to Mr Richardson, the translator of his works, in which he speaks of “The Death-day of his son.” A song for the death-day of the brave— A song of pride! The youth went down to a hero's grave, With the Sword, his bride. See The Sword Song, composed on the morning of his death. He went, with his noble heart unworn, And pure, and high; An eagle stooping from clouds of morn, Only to die. He went with the lyre, whose lofty tone Beneath his hand Had thrill'd to the name of his God alone, And his father-land. And with all his glorious feelings yet In their first glow, Like a southern stream that no frost hath met To chain its flow. A song for the death-day of the brave— A song of pride! For him that went to a hero's grave, With the Sword, his bride. He hath left a voice in his trumpet lays To turn the flight, And a guiding spirit for after days, Like a watchfire's light. And a grief in his father's soul to rest, 'Midst all high thought; And a memory unto his mother's breast, With healing fraught. And a name and fame above the blight Of earthly breath, Beautiful—beautiful and bright, In life and death! A song for the death-day of the brave— A song of pride! For him that went to a hero's grave, With the Sword, his bride! AN HOUR OF ROMANCE. “I come To this sweet place for quiet. Every tree, And bush, and fragrant flower, and hilly path, And thymy mound that flings unto the winds Its morning incense, is my friend.” Barry Cornwall. There were thick leaves above me and around, And low sweet sighs like those of childhood's sleep, Amidst their dimness, and a fitful sound As of soft showers on water;—dark and deep Lay the oak shadows o'er the turf, so still They seem'd but pictured glooms; a hidden rill Made music, such as haunts us in a dream, Under the fern tufts; and a tender gleam Of soft green light, as by the glowworm shed, Came pouring through the woven beech-boughs down, And steep'd the magic page wherein I read Of royal chivalry and old renown, A tale of Palestine. The Talisman—Tales of the Crusaders.—Meanwhile the bee Swept past me with a tone of summer hours, A drowsy bugle, wafting thoughts of flowers, Blue skies, and amber sunshine: brightly free, On filmy wings, the purple dragon-fly Shot glancing like a fairy javelin by; And a sweet voice of sorrow told the dell Where sat the lone wood-pigeon: But ere long, All sense of these things faded, as the spell Breathing from that high gorgeous tale grew strong On my chain'd soul:—'twas not the leaves I heard;— A Syrian wind the lion-banner stirr'd, Through its proud floating folds:—'twas not the brook Singing in secret through its grassy glen;— A wild shrill trumpet of the Saracen Peal'd from the desert's lonely heart, and shook The burning air.—Like clouds when winds are high, O'er glittering sands flew steeds of Araby, And tents rose up, and sudden lance and spear Flash'd where a fountain's diamond wave lay clear, Shadow'd by graceful palm-trees. Then the shout Of merry England's joy swell'd freely out, Sent through an eastern heaven, whose glorious hue Made shields dark mirrors to its depths of blue; And harps were there—I heard their sounding strings, As the waste echo'd to the mirth of kings.— The bright mask faded. Unto life's worn track, What call'd me from its flood of glory back? A voice of happy childhood!—and they pass'd, Banner, and harp, and Paynim's trumpet's blast; Yet might I scarce bewail the splendours gone, My heart so leap'd to that sweet laughter's tone. A VOYAGER'S DREAM OF LAND. “His very heart athirst To gaze at nature in her green array, Upon the ship's tall side he stands possess'd With visions prompted by intense desire; Fair fields appear below, such as he left Far distant, such as he would die to find:— He seeks them headlong, and is seen no more.” Cowper. The hollow dash of waves!—the ceaseless roar!— Silence, ye billows!—vex my soul no more. There's a spring in the woods by my sunny home, Afar from the dark sea's tossing foam; Oh! the fall of that fountain is sweet to hear, As a song from the shore to the sailor's ear! And the sparkle which up to the sun it throws, Through the feathery fern and the olive boughs, And the gleam on its path as it steals away Into deeper shades from the sultry day, And the large water-lilies that o'er its bed Their pearly leaves to the soft light spread, They haunt me! I dream of that bright spring's flow, I thirst for its rills like a wounded roe! Be still, thou sea-bird, with thy clanging cry! My spirit sickens as thy wing sweeps by. Know ye my home, with the lulling sound Of leaves from the lime and the chestnut round? Know ye it, brethren! where bower'd it lies, Under the purple of southern skies? With the streamy gold of the sun that shines In through the cloud of its clustering vines, And the summer breath of the myrtle flowers, Borne from the mountain in dewy hours, And the fire-fly's glance through the dark'ning shades Like shooting stars in the forest glades, And the scent of the citron at eve's dim fall— Speak! have ye known, have ye felt them all? The heavy rolling surge! the rocking mast! Hush! give my dream's deep music way, thou blast. Oh, the glad sounds of the joyous earth! The notes of the singing cicala's mirth, The murmurs that live in the mountain pines, The sighing of reeds as the day declines, The wings flitting home through the crimson glow That steeps the wood when the sun is low, The voice of the night-bird that sends a thrill To the heart of the leaves when the winds are still— I hear them!—around me they rise, they swell, They call back my spirit with Hope to dwell— They come with a breath from the fresh spring-time, And waken my youth in its hour of prime. The white foam dashes high—away, away! Shroud my green land no more, thou blinding spray! It is there!—down the mountains I see the sweep Of the chestnut forests, the rich and deep, With the burden and glory of flowers that they bear, Floating upborne on the blue summer air, And the light pouring through them in tender gleams, And the flashing forth of a thousand streams! Hold me not, brethren! I go, I go To the hills of my youth, where the myrtles blow, To the depths of the woods, where the shadows rest, Massy and still, on the greensward's breast, To the rocks that resound with the water's play— I hear the sweet laugh of my fount—give way! Give way!—the booming surge, the tempest's roar, The sea-bird's wail shall vex my soul no more. THE EFFIGIES. “Der rasche Kampf verewigt einen Mann: Er falle gleich, so preiset ihn das Lied. Allein die Thränen, die unendlichen Der überbliebnen, der verlass'nen Frau, Zählt keine Nachwelt.” Goethe. Warrior! whose image on thy tomb, With shield and crested head, Sleeps proudly in the purple gloom By the stain'd window shed; The records of thy name and race Have faded from the stone, Yet, through a cloud of years, I trace What thou hast been and done. A banner, from its flashing spear, Flung out o'er many a fight; A war-cry ringing far and clear, And strong to turn the flight; An arm that bravely bore the lance On for the holy shrine; A haughty heart and a kingly glance— Chief! were not these things thine? A lofty place where leaders sate Around the council board; In festive halls a chair of state When the blood-red wine was pour'd; A name that drew a prouder tone From herald, harp, and bard; Surely these things were all thine own— So hadst thou thy reward. Woman! whose sculptured form at rest By the arm'd knight is laid, With meek hands folded o'er a breast In matron robes array'd; What was thy tale?—O gentle mate Of him, the bold and free, Bound unto his victorious fate, What bard hath sung of thee? He woo'd a bright and burning star— Thine was the void, the gloom, The straining eye that follow'd far His fast receding plume; The heart-sick listening while his steed Sent echoes on the breeze; The pang—but when did Fame take heed Of griefs obscure as these? Thy silent and secluded hours Through many a lonely day While bending o'er thy broider'd flowers, With spirits far away; Thy weeping midnight prayers for him Who fought on Syrian plains, Thy watchings till the torch grew dim— These fill no minstrel strains. A still, sad life was thine!—long years With tasks unguerdon'd fraught— Deep, quiet love, submissive tears, Vigils of anxious thought; Prayer at the cross in fervour pour'd, Alms to the pilgrim given— Oh! happy, happier than thy lord, In that lone path to heaven! THE LANDING OF THE PILGRIM FATHERS IN NEW ENGLAND. “Look now abroad—another race has fill'd Those populous borders—wide the wood recedes, And towns shoot up, and fertile realms are till'd; The land is full of harvests and green meads.” Bryant. The breaking waves dash'd high On a stern and rock-bound coast, And the woods against a stormy sky Their giant branches toss'd; And the heavy night hung dark, The hills and waters o'er, When a band of exiles moor'd their bark On the wild New England shore. Not as the conqueror comes, They, the true-hearted, came; Not with the roll of the stirring drums, And the trumpet that sings of fame; Not as the flying come, In silence and in fear;— They shook the depths of the desert gloom With their hymns of lofty cheer. Amidst the storm they sang, And the stars heard and the sea; And the sounding aisles of the dim woods rang To the anthem of the free! The ocean eagle soar'd From his nest by the white wave's foam; And the rocking pines of the forest roar'd— This was their welcome home! There were men with hoary hair Amidst that pilgrim band;— Why had they come to wither there, Away from their childhood's land? There was woman's fearless eye, Lit by her deep love's truth; There was manhood's brow serenely high, And the fiery heart of youth. What sought they thus afar? Bright jewels of the mine? The wealth of seas, the spoils of war?— They sought a faith's pure shrine! Ay, call it holy ground, The soil where first they trode. They have left unstain'd what there they found— Freedom to worship God. THE SPIRIT'S MYSTERIES. “And slight, withal, may be the things which bring Back on the heart the weight which it would fling Aside for ever;—it may be a sound— A tone of music—summer's breath, or spring— A flower—a leaf—the ocean—which may wound— Striking th' electric chain wherewith we are darkly bound.” Childe Harold. The power that dwelleth in sweet sounds to waken Vague yearnings, like the sailor's for the shore, And dim remembrances, whose hue seems taken From some bright former state, our own no more; Is not this all a mystery?—Who shall say Whence are those thoughts, and whither tends their way? The sudden images of vanish'd things, That o'er the spirit flash, we know not why; Tones from some broken harp's deserted strings, Warm sunset hues of summers long gone by; A rippling wave—the dashing of an oar— A flower scent floating past our parents' door; A word—scarce noted in its hour perchance, Yet back returning with a plaintive tone; A smile—a sunny or a mournful glance, Full of sweet meanings now from this world flown; Are not these mysteries when to life they start, And press vain tears in gushes from the heart? And the far wanderings of the soul in dreams, Calling up shrouded faces from the dead, And with them bringing soft or solemn gleams, Familiar objects brightly to o'erspread; And wakening buried love, or joy, or fear— These are night's mysteries—who shall make them clear? And the strange inborn sense of coming ill, That ofttimes whispers to the haunted breast, In a low tone which nought can drown or still, 'Midst feasts and melodies a secret guest; Whence doth that murmur wake, that shadow fall? Why shakes the spirit thus?—'tis mystery all! Darkly we move—we press upon the brink Haply of viewless worlds, and know it not; Yes! it may be, that nearer than we think Are those whom death has parted from our lot! Fearfully, wondrously, our souls are made— Let us walk humbly on, but undismay'd! Humbly—for knowledge strives in vain to feel Her way amidst these marvels of the mind; Yet undismay'd—for do they not reveal Th' immortal being with our dust entwined?— So let us deem! and e'en the tears they wake Shall then be blest, for that high nature's sake. THE DEPARTED. “Thou shalt lie down With patriarchs of the infant world—with kings, The powerful of the earth—the wise—the good, Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past, All in one mighty sepulchre.” Bryant. And shrink ye from the way To the spirit's distant shore?— Earth's mightiest men, in arm'd array, Are thither gone before. The warrior kings, whose banner Flew far as eagles fly, They are gone where swords avail them not, From the feast of victory. And the seers who sat of yore By orient palm or wave, They have pass'd with all their starry lore— Can ye still fear the grave? We fear! we fear!—the sunshine Is joyous to behold, And we reck not of the buried kings, Nor the awful seers of old. Ye shrink!—the bards whose lays Have made your deep hearts burn— They have left the sun, and the voice of praise, For the land whence none return. And the beautiful, whose record Is the verse that cannot die, They too are gone, with their glorious bloom, From the love of human eye. Would ye not join that throng Of the earth's departed flowers, And the masters of the mighty song In their far and fadeless bowers? Those songs are high and holy, But they vanquish not our fear; Not from our path those flowers are gone— We fain would linger here! Linger then yet awhile, As the last leaves on the bough!— Ye have loved the light of many a smile That is taken from you now. There have been sweet singing voices In your walks, that now are still; There are seats left void in your earthly homes, Which none again may fill. Soft eyes are seen no more, That made Spring-time in your heart; Kindred and friends are gone before— And ye still fear to part? We fear not now, we fear not! Though the way through darkness bends; Our souls are strong to follow them, Our own familiar friends! THE PALM-TREE. This incident is, I think, recorded by De Lille, in his poem of Les Jardins. It waved not through an eastern sky, Beside a fount of Araby; It was not fann'd by southern breeze In some green isle of Indian seas; Nor did its graceful shadow sleep O'er stream of Afric, lone and deep. But fair the exiled palm-tree grew 'Midst foliage of no kindred hue; Through the laburnum's dropping gold Rose the light shaft of orient mould, And Europe's violets, faintly sweet, Purpled the moss-beds at its feet. Strange look'd it there!—the willow stream'd Where silvery waters near it gleam'd; The lime bough lured the honey-bee To murmur by the desert's tree, And showers of snowy roses made A lustre in its fan-like shade. There came an eve of festal hours— Rich music fill'd that garden's bowers: Lamps, that from flowering branches hung, On sparks of dew soft colour flung, And bright forms glanced—a fairy show— Under the blossoms to and fro. But one, a lone one, midst the throng, Seem'd reckless all of dance or song: He was a youth of dusky mien, Whereon the Indian sun had been, Of crested brow and long black hair— A stranger, like the palm-tree, there. And slowly, sadly, moved his plumes, Glittering athwart the leafy glooms: He pass'd the pale green olives by, Nor won the chestnut flowers his eye; But when to that sole palm he came, Then shot a rapture through his frame! To him, to him its rustling spoke, The silence of his soul it broke! It whisper'd of his own bright isle, That lit the ocean with a smile; Ay, to his ear that native tone Had something of the sea wave's moan! His mother's cabin home, that lay Where feathery cocoas fringed the bay; The dashing of his brethren's oar— The conch-note heard along the shore; All through his wakening bosom swept— He clasp'd his country's tree and wept! Oh, scorn him not!—the strength whereby The patriot girds himself to die, Th' unconquerable power which fills The freeman battling on his hills— These have one fountain deep and clear— The same whence gush'd that childlike tear! THE CHILD'S LAST SLEEP. SUGGESTED BY A MONUMENT OF CHANTREY'S. Thou sleepest—but when wilt thou wake, fair child? When the fawn awakes in the forest wild? When the lark's wing mounts with the breeze of morn? When the first rich breath of the rose is born?— Lovely thou sleepest, yet something lies Too deep and still on thy soft-seal'd eyes; Mournful, though sweet, is thy rest to see— When will the hour of thy rising be? Not when the fawn wakes—not when the lark On the crimson cloud of the morn floats dark— Grief with vain passionate tears hath wet The hair, shedding gleams from thy pale brow yet; Love, with sad kisses unfelt, hath press'd Thy meek dropt eyelids and quiet breast; And the glad Spring, calling out bird and bee, Shall colour all blossoms, fair child! but thee. Thou'rt gone from us, bright one!—that thou shouldst die, And life be left to the butterfly! A butterfly, as if resting on a flower, is sculptured on the monument. Thou'rt gone as a dewdrop is swept from the bough: Oh! for the world where thy home is now! How may we love but in doubt and fear, How may we anchor our fond hearts here; How should e'en joy but a trembler be, Beautiful dust! when we look on thee? THE SUNBEAM. Thou art no lingerer in monarch's hall— A joy thou art, and a wealth to all! A bearer of hope unto land and sea— Sunbeam! what gift hath the world like thee? Thou art walking the billows, and ocean smiles; Thou hast touch'd with glory his thousand isles; Thou hast lit up the ships, and the feathery foam, And gladden'd the sailor, like words from home. To the solemn depths of the forest shades, Thou art streaming on through their green arcades; And the quivering leaves that have caught thy glow, Like fire-flies glance to the pools below. I look'd on the mountains—a vapour lay Folding their heights in its dark array: Thou brakest forth, and the mist became A crown and a mantle of living flame. I look'd on the peasant's lowly cot— Something of sadness had wrapt the spot; But a gleam of thee on its lattice fell, And it laugh'd into beauty at that bright spell. To the earth's wild places a guest thou art, Flushing the waste like the rose's heart; And thou scornest not from thy pomp to shed A tender smile on the ruin's head. Thou takest through the dim church aisle thy way, And its pillars from twilight flash forth to day, And its high, pale tombs, with their trophies old, Are bathed in a flood as of molten gold. And thou turnest not from the humblest grave, Where a flower to the sighing winds may wave; Thou scatterest its gloom like the dreams of rest, Thou sleepest in love on its grassy breast. Sunbeam of summer! oh, what is like thee? Hope of the wilderness, joy of the sea!— One thing is like thee to mortals given, The faith touching all things with hues of heaven! BREATHINGS OF SPRING. Thou givest me flowers, thou givest me songs;—bring back The love that I have lost! What wakest thou, Spring!—sweet voices in the woods, And reed-like echoes, that have long been mute; Thou bringest back, to fill the solitudes, The lark's clear pipe, the cuckoo's viewless flute, Whose tone seems breathing mournfulness or glee, E'en as our hearts may be. And the leaves greet thee, Spring!—the joyous leaves, Whose tremblings gladden many a copse and glade, Where each young spray a rosy flush receives, When thy south wind hath pierced the whispery shade, And happy murmurs, running through the grass, Tell that thy footsteps pass. And the bright waters—they too hear thy call, Spring, the awakener! thou hast burst their sleep! Amidst the hollows of the rocks their fall Makes melody, and in the forests deep, Where sudden sparkles and blue gleams betray Their windings to the day. And flowers—the fairy-peopled world of flowers! Thou from the dust hast set that glory free, Colouring the cowslip with the sunny hours, And penciling the wood anemone; Silent they seem—yet each to thoughtful eye Glows with mute poesy. But what awakest thou in the heart, O Spring! The human heart, with all its dreams and sighs? Thou that givest back so many a buried thing, Restorer of forgotten harmonies! Fresh songs and scents break forth where'er thou art, What wakest thou in the heart? Too much, oh! there too much!—we know not well Wherefore it should be thus, yet roused by thee, What fond, strange yearnings, from the soul's deep cell, Gush for the faces we no more may see! How are we haunted, in the wind's low tone, By voices that are gone! Looks of familiar love, that never more, Never on earth, our aching eyes shall meet, Past words of welcome to our household door, And vanish'd smiles, and sounds of parted feet— Spring! 'midst the murmurs of thy flowering trees, Why, why revivest thou these? Vain longings for the dead!—why come they back With thy young birds, and leaves, and living blooms? Oh! is it not, that from thine earthly track Hope to thy world may look beyond the tombs? Yes! gentle spring; no sorrow dims thine air, Breathed by our loved ones there! THE ILLUMINATED CITY. The hills all glow'd with a festive light, For the royal city rejoiced by night: There were lamps hung forth upon tower and tree, Banners were lifted and streaming free; Every tall pillar was wreath'd with fire; Like a shooting meteor was every spire; And the outline of many a dome on high Was traced, as in stars, on the clear dark sky. I pass'd through the streets; there were throngs on throngs— Like sounds of the deep were their mingled songs; There was music forth from each palace borne— A peal of the cymbal, the harp, and horn; The forests heard it, the mountains rang, The hamlets woke to its haughty clang; Rich and victorious was every tone, Telling the land of her foes o'erthrown. Didst thou meet not a mourner for all the slain? Thousands lie dead on their battle plain! Gallant and true were the hearts that fell— Grief in the homes they have left must dwell: Grief o'er the aspect of childhood spread, And bowing the beauty of woman's head: Didst thou hear, 'midst the songs, not one tender moan, For the many brave to their slumbers gone? I saw not the face of a weeper there— Too strong, perchance, was the bright lamp's glare!— I heard not a wail 'midst the joyous crowd— The music of victory was all too loud! Mighty it roll'd on the winds afar, Shaking the streets like a conqueror's car; Through torches and streamers its flood swept by— How could I listen for moan or sigh? Turn then away from life's pageants, turn, If its deep story thy heart would learn! Ever too bright is that outward show, Dazzling the eyes till they see not woe. But lift the proud mantle which hides from thy view The things thou shouldst gaze on, the sad and true; Nor fear to survey what its folds conceal— So must thy spirit be taught to feel! THE SPELLS OF HOME. “There blend the ties that strengthen Our hearts in hours of grief, The silver links that lengthen Joy's visits when most brief.” Bernard Barton. By the soft green light in the woody glade, On the banks of moss where thy childhood play'd, By the household tree through which thine eye First look'd in love to the summer sky, By the dewy gleam, by the very breath Of the primrose tufts in the grass beneath, Upon thy heart there is laid a spell, Holy and precious—oh! guard it well! By the sleepy ripple of the stream, Which hath lull'd thee into many a dream, By the shiver of the ivy leaves To the wind of morn at thy casement eaves, By the bee's deep murmur in the limes, By the music of the Sabbath chimes, By every sound of thy native shade, Stronger and dearer the spell is made. By the gathering round the winter hearth When twilight call'd unto household mirth, By the fairy tale or the legend old In that ring of happy faces told, By the quiet hour when hearts unite In the parting prayer and the kind “Good-night!” By the smiling eye and the loving tone, Over thy life has the spell been thrown. And bless that gift!—it hath gentle might, A guardian power and a guiding light. It hath led the freeman forth to stand In the mountain battles of his land; It hath brought the wanderer o'er the seas To die on the hills of his own fresh breeze; And back to the gates of his father's hall It hath led the weeping prodigal. Yes! when thy heart, in its pride, would stray From the pure first loves of its youth away— When the sullying breath of the world would come O'er the flowers it brought from its childhood's home— Think thou again of the woody glade, And the sound by the rustling ivy made, Think of the tree at thy father's door, And the kindly spell shall have power once more! ROMAN GIRL'S SONG. “Roma, Roma, Roma! Non è più come era prima.” Rome, Rome! thou art no more As thou hast been! On thy seven hills of yore Thou satt'st a queen. Thou hadst thy triumphs then Purpling the street, Leaders and sceptred men Bow'd at thy feet. They that thy mantle wore, As gods were seen— Rome, Rome! thou art no more As thou hast been! Rome! thine imperial brow Never shall rise: What hast thou left thee now?— Thou hast thy skies! Blue, deeply blue, they are, Gloriously bright! Veiling thy wastes afar With colour'd light. Thou hast the sunset's glow, Rome, for thy dower, Flushing tall cypress bough, Temple and tower! And all sweet sounds are thine, Lovely to hear, While night, o'er tomb and shrine, Rests darkly clear. Many a solemn hymn, By starlight sung, Sweeps through the arches dim, Thy wrecks among. Many a flute's low swell, On thy soft air Lingers, and loves to dwell With summer there. Thou hast the south's rich gift Of sudden song— A charm'd fountain, swift, Joyous, and strong. Thou hast fair forms that move With queenly tread; Thou hast proud fanes above Thy mighty dead. Yet wears thy Tiber's shore A mournful mien:— Rome, Rome! thou art no more As thou hast been! THE DISTANT SHIP. The sea-bird's wing, o'er ocean's breast Shoots like a glancing star, While the red radiance of the west Spreads kindling fast and far; And yet that splendour wins thee not— Thy still and thoughtful eye Dwells but on one dark distant spot Of all the main and sky. Look round thee!—o'er the slumbering deep, A solemn glory broods; A fire hath touch'd the beacon-steep, And all the golden woods; A thousand gorgeous clouds on high Burn with the amber light!— What spell, from that rich pageantry, Chains down thy gazing sight? A softening thought of human cares, A feeling link'd to earth! Is not yon speck a bark which bears The loved of many a hearth? Oh! do not Hope, and Grief, and Fear, Crowd her frail world even now, And manhood's prayer and woman's tear Follow her venturous prow? Bright are the floating clouds above, The glittering seas below; But we are bound by cords of love To kindred weal and woe. Therefore, amidst this wide array Of glorious things and fair, My soul is on that bark's lone way— For human hearts are there. THE BIRDS OF PASSAGE. Birds, joyous birds of the wandering wing! Whence is it ye come with the flowers of spring?— “We come from the shores of the green old Nile, From the land where the roses of Sharon smile, From the palms that wave through the Indian sky, From the myrrh-trees of glowing Araby. “We have swept o'er cities in song renown'd— Silent they lie with the deserts round! We have cross'd proud rivers, whose tide hath roll'd All dark with the warrior-blood of old; And each worn wing hath regain'd its home, Under peasant's roof-tree or monarch's dome.” And what have ye found in the monarch's dome, Since last ye traversed the blue sea's foam?— “We have found a change, we have found a pall, And a gloom o'ershadowing the banquet's hall, And a mark on the floor as of life-drops spilt— Nought looks the same, save the nest we built!” O joyous birds, it hath still been so; Through the halls of kings doth the tempest go! But the huts of the hamlet lie still and deep, And the hills o'er their quiet a vigil keep: Say what have ye found in the peasant's cot, Since last ye parted from that sweet spot?— “A change we have found there—and many a change! Faces, and footsteps, and all things strange! Gone are the heads of the silvery hair, And the young that were have a brow of care, And the place is hush'd where the children play'd— Nought looks the same, save the nest we made!” Sad is your tale of the beautiful earth, Birds that o'ersweep it in power and mirth! Yet through the wastes of the trackless air Ye have a guide, and shall we despair? Ye over desert and deep have pass'd— So may we reach our bright home at last! THE GRAVES OF A HOUSEHOLD. They grew in beauty, side by side, They fill'd one home with glee;— Their graves are sever'd, far and wide, By mount, and stream, and sea. The same fond mother bent at night O'er each fair sleeping brow; She had each folded flower in sight— Where are those dreamers now? One, 'midst the forest of the west, By a dark stream is laid— The Indian knows his place of rest, Far in the cedar shade. The sea, the blue lone sea, hath one— He lies where pearls lie deep; He was the loved of all, yet none O'er his low bed may weep. One sleeps where southern vines are drest, Above the noble slain: He wrapt his colours round his breast On a blood-red field of Spain. And one—o'er her the myrtle showers Its leaves, by soft winds fann'd; She faded 'midst Italian flowers— The last of that bright band. And parted thus they rest, who play'd Beneath the same green tree; Whose voices mingled as they pray'd Around one parent knee! They that with smiles lit up the hall, And cheer'd with song the hearth— Alas! for love, if thou wert all, And nought beyond, O earth! MOZART'S REQUIEM. “These birds of Paradise but long to flee Back to their native mansion.” Prophecy of Dante. A requiem!—and for whom? For beauty in its bloom? For valour fallen—a broken rose or sword? A dirge for king or chief, With pomp of stately grief, Banner, and torch, and waving plume deplored? Not so—it is not so! The warning voice I know, From other worlds a strange mysterious tone; A solemn funeral air, It call'd me to prepare, And my heart answer'd secretly—my own! One more then, one more strain, In links of joy and pain, Mighty the troubled spirit to inthrall! And let me breathe my dower Of passion and of power Full into that deep lay—the last of all! The last!—and I must go From this bright world below, This realm of sunshine, ringing with sweet sound! Must leave its festal skies, With all their melodies, That ever in my breast glad echoes found! Yet have I known it long: Too restless and too strong Within this clay hath been th' o'ermastering flame; Swift thoughts, that came and went, Like torrents o'er me sent, Have shaken, as a reed, my thrilling frame. Like perfumes on the wind, Which none may stay or bind, The beautiful comes floating through my soul; I strive with yearnings vain The spirit to detain Of the deep harmonies that past me roll! Therefore disturbing dreams Trouble the secret streams And founts of music that o'erflow my breast; Something far more divine Than may on earth be mine, Haunts my worn heart, and will not let me rest. Shall I then fear the tone That breathes from worlds unknown?— Surely these feverish aspirations there Shall grasp their full desire, And this unsettled fire Burn calmly, brightly, in immortal air. One more then, one more strain; To earthly joy and pain A rich, and deep, and passionate farewell! I pour each fervent thought, With fear, hope, trembling, fraught, Into the notes that o'er my dust shall swell. THE IMAGE IN LAVA. The impression of a woman's form, with an infant clasped to the bosom, found at the uncovering of Herculaneum. Thou thing of years departed! What ages have gone by, Since here the mournful seal was set By love and agony? Temple and tower have moulder'd, Empires from earth have pass'd, And woman's heart hath left a trace Those glories to outlast! And childhood's fragile image, Thus fearfully enshrined, Survives the proud memorials rear'd By conquerors of mankind. Babe! wert thou brightly slumbering Upon thy mother's breast, When suddenly the fiery tomb Shut round each gentle guest? A strange, dark fate o'ertook you, Fair babe and loving heart! One moment of a thousand pangs— Yet better than to part! Haply of that fond bosom On ashes here impress'd, Thou wert the only treasure, child! Whereon a hope might rest. Perchance all vainly lavish'd Its other love had been, And where it trusted, nought remain'd But thorns on which to lean. Far better, then, to perish, Thy form within its clasp, Than live and lose thee, precious one! From that impassion'd grasp. Oh! I could pass all relics Left by the pomps of old, To gaze on this rude monument Cast in affection's mould. Love, human love! what art thou? Thy print upon the dust Outlives the cities of renown Wherein the mighty trust! Immortal, oh! immortal Thou art, whose earthly glow Hath given these ashes holiness— It must, it must be so! CHRISTMAS CAROL. O lovely voices of the sky, That hymn'd the Saviour's birth! Are ye not singing still on high, Ye that sang, “Peace on earth?” To us yet speak the strains Wherewith, in days gone by, Ye bless'd the Syrian swains, O voices of the sky! O clear and shining light, whose beams That hour Heaven's glory shed Around the palms, and o'er the streams, And on the shepherds' head; Be near, through life and death, As in that holiest night Of Hope, and Joy, and Faith, O clear and shining light! O star which led to him whose love Brought down man's ransom free; Where art thou?—'Midst the hosts above May we still gaze on thee! In heaven thou art not set, Thy rays earth might not dim— Send them to guide us yet, O star which led to him! A FATHER READING THE BIBLE. 'Twas early day, and sunlight stream'd Soft through a quiet room, That hush'd, but not forsaken seem'd, Still, but with nought of gloom. For there, serene in happy age, Whose hope is from above, A father communed with the page Of Heaven's recorded love. Pure fell the beam, and meekly bright, On his grey holy hair, And touch'd the page with tenderest light, As if its shrine were there! But oh! that patriarch's aspect shone With something lovelier far— A radiance all the spirit's own, Caught not from sun or star. Some word of life e'en then had met His calm, benignant eye; Some ancient promise, breathing yet Of Immortality! Some martyr's prayer, wherein the glow Of quenchless faith survives: While every feature said—“I know That my Redeemer lives!” And silent stood his children by, Hushing their very breath, Before the solemn sanctity Of thoughts o'ersweeping death. Silent—yet did not each young breast With love and reverence melt? Oh! blest be those fair girls, and blest That home where God is felt! THE MEETING OF THE BROTHERS. For the tale on which this little poem is founded, see L'Hermite en Italie. —“His early days Were with him in his heart.” Wordsworth. The voices of two forest boys, In years when hearts entwine, Had fill'd with childhood's merry noise A valley of the Rhine: To rock and stream that sound was known, Gladsome as hunter's bugle-tone. The sunny laughter of their eyes, There had each vineyard seen; Up every cliff whence eagles rise, Their bounding step hath been: Ay! their bright youth a glory threw, O'er the wild place wherein they grew. But this, as day-spring's flush, was brief As early bloom or dew; Alas! 'tis but the wither'd leaf That wears the enduring hue: Those rocks along the Rhine's fair shore, Might girdle in their world no more. For now on manhood's verge they stood, And heard life's thrilling call, As if a silver clarion woo'd To some high festival; And parted as young brothers part, With love in each unsullied heart. They parted—soon the paths divide Wherein our steps were one, Like river-branches, far and wide, Dissevering as they run; And making strangers in their course, Of waves that had the same bright source. Met they no more?—once more they met, Those kindred hearts and true! 'Twas on a field of death, where yet The battle-thunders flew, Though the fierce day was wellnigh past, And the red sunset smiled its last. But as the combat closed, they found For tender thoughts a space, And e'en upon that bloody ground Room for one bright embrace, And pour'd forth on each other's neck Such tears as warriors need not check. The mists o'er boyhood's memory spread All melted with those tears, The faces of the holy dead Rose as in vanish'd years; The Rhine, the Rhine, the ever blest, Lifted its voice in each full breast! Oh! was it then a time to die? It was!—that not in vain The soul of childhood's purity And peace might turn again: A ball swept forth—'twas guided well— Heart unto heart those brothers fell! Happy, yes, happy thus to go! Bearing from earth away Affections, gifted ne'er to know A shadow—a decay. A passing touch of change or chill, A breath of aught whose breath can kill. And they, between whose sever'd souls, Once in close union tied, A gulf is set, a current rolls For ever to divide; Well may they envy such a lot, Whose hearts yearn on—but mingle not. THE LAST WISH. “Well may I weep to leave this world—thee—all these beautiful woods, and plains, and hills.” Lights and Shadows. Go to the forest shade, Seek thou the well-known glade, Where, heavy with sweet dew, the violets lie, Gleaming through moss-tufts deep, Like dark eyes fill'd with sleep, And bathed in hues of Summer's midnight sky. Bring me their buds, to shed Around my dying bed A breath of May and of the wood's repose; For I in sooth, depart With a reluctant heart, That fain would linger where the bright sun glows. Fain would I stay with thee— Alas! this may not be; Yet bring me still the gifts of happier hours! Go where the fountain's breast Catches, in glassy rest, The dim green light that pours through laurel bowers. I know how softly bright, Steep'd in that tender light, The water-lilies tremble there e'en now; Go to the pure stream's edge, And from its whisp'ring sedge Bring me those flowers to cool my fever'd brow! Then, as in Hope's young days, Track thou the antique maze Of the rich garden to its grassy mound; There is a lone white rose, Shedding, in sudden snows, Its faint leaves o'er the emerald turf around. Well know'st thou that fair tree— A murmur of the bee Dwells ever in the honey'd lime above; Bring me one pearly flower Of all its clustering shower— For on that spot we first reveal'd our love. Gather one woodbine bough, Then, from the lattice low Of the bower'd cottage which I bade thee mark, When by the hamlet last, Through dim wood lanes we pass'd, While dews were glancing to the glowworm's spark. Haste! to my pillow bear Those fragrant things and fair; My hand no more may bind them up at eve— Yet shall their odour soft One bright dream round me waft Of life, youth, summer—all that I must leave! And, oh! if thou would'st ask Wherefore thy steps I task, The grove, the stream, the hamlet vale to trace— 'Tis that some thought of me, When I am gone, may be The spirit bound to each familiar place. I bid mine image dwell (Oh! break not thou the spell!) In the deep wood and by the fountain side; Thou must not, my beloved! Rove where we two have roved, Forgetting her that in her Spring-time died! FAIRY FAVOURS. ?Give me but Something whereunto I may bind my heart: Something to love, to rest upon, to clasp Affection's tendrils round.? Would'st thou wear the gift of immortal bloom? Would'st thou smile in scorn at the shadowy tomb? Drink of this cup! it is richly fraught With balm from the gardens of genii brought; Drink, and the spoiler shall pass thee by, When the young all scatter'd like rose leaves lie. And would not the youth of my soul be gone, If the loved had left me, one by one? Take back the cup that may never bless, The gift that would make me brotherless; How should I live, with no kindred eye To reflect mine immortality! Would'st thou have empire, by sign or spell, Over the mighty in air that dwell? Would'st thou call the spirits of shore and steep To fetch thee jewels from ocean's deep? Wave but this rod, and a viewless band, Slaves to thy will, shall around thee stand. And would not fear, at my coming then, Hush every voice in the homes of men? Would not bright eyes in my presence quail? Young cheeks with a nameless thrill turn pale? No gift be mine that aside would turn The human love for whose founts I yearn! Would'st thou then read through the hearts of those Upon whose faith thou hast sought repose? Wear this rich gem! it is charm'd to show When a change comes over affection's glow; Look on its flushing or fading hue, And learn if the trusted be false or true! Keep, keep the gem, that I still may trust, Though my heart's wealth be but pour'd on dust! Let not a doubt in my soul have place, To dim the light of a loved one's face; Leave to the earth its warm sunny smile— That glory would pass could I look on guile! Say, then, what boon of my power shall be, Favour'd of spirits! pour'd forth on thee? Thou scornest the treasures of wave and mine, Thou wilt not drink of the cup divine, Thou art fain with a mortal's lot to rest— Answer me! how may I grace it best? Oh! give me no sway o'er the powers unseen, But a human heart where my own may lean! A friend, one tender and faithful friend, Whose thoughts' free current with mine may blend, And leaving not either on earth alone, Bid the bright calm close of our lives be one!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. VI. SONGS OF THE AFFECTIONS; WITH OTHER POEMS. They tell but dreams—a lonely spirit's dreams; Yet ever through their fleeting imagery Wanders a vein of melancholy love, An aimless thought of home; as in the song Of the caged skylark ye may deem there dwells A passionate memory of blue skies and flowers, And living streams—far off! A SPIRIT'S RETURN. “This is to be a mortal, And seek the things beyond mortality!” Manfred. Thy voice prevails—dear friend, my gentle friend! This long-shut heart for thee shall be unseal'd, And though thy soft eye mournfully will bend Over the troubled stream, yet once reveal'd Shall its freed waters flow; then rocks must close For evermore, above their dark repose. Come while the gorgeous mysteries of the sky Fused in the crimson sea of sunset lie; Come to the woods, where all strange wandering sound Is mingled into harmony profound; Where the leaves thrill with spirit, while the wind Fills with a viewless being, unconfined, The trembling reeds and fountains—our own dell, With its green dimness and Æolian breath, Shall suit th' unveiling of dark records well— Hear me in tenderness and silent faith! Thou knew'st me not in life's fresh vernal morn— I would thou had'st!—for then my heart on thine Had pour'd a worthier love; now, all o'erworn By its deep thirst for something too divine, It hath but fitful music to bestow, Echoes of harp-strings broken long ago. Yet even in youth companionless I stood, As a lone forest-bird 'midst ocean's foam; For me the silver cords of brotherhood Were early loosed; the voices from my home Pass'd one by one, and melody and mirth Left me a dreamer by a silent hearth. But, with the fulness of a heart that burn'd For the deep sympathies of mind, I turn'd From that unanswering spot, and fondly sought In all wild scenes with thrilling murmurs fraught, In every still small voice and sound of power, And flute-note of the wind through cave and bower A perilous delight!—for then first woke My life's lone passion, the mysterious quest Of secret knowledge; and each tone that broke From the wood-arches or the fountain's breast, Making my quick soul vibrate as a lyre, But minister'd to that strange inborn fire. 'Midst the bright silence of the mountain dells, In noontide-hours or golden summer-eves, My thoughts have burst forth as a gale that swells Into a rushing blast, and from the leaves Shakes out response. O thou rich world unseen! Thou curtain'd realm of spirits!—thus my cry Hath troubled air and silence—dost thou lie Spread all around, yet by some filmy screen Shut from us ever? The resounding woods, Do their depths teem with marvels!—and the floods, And the pure fountains, leading secret veins Of quenchless melody through rock and hill, Have they bright dwellers?—are their lone domains Peopled with beauty, which may never still Our weary thirst of soul?—Cold, weak and cold, Is earth's vain language, piercing not one fold Of our deep being! Oh, for gifts more high! For a seer's glance to rend mortality! For a charm'd rod, to call from each dark shrine The oracles divine! I woke from those high fantasies, to know My kindred with the earth—I woke to love: O gentle friend! to love in doubt and woe, Shutting the heart the worshipp'd name above, Is to love deeply—and my spirit's dower Was a sad gift, a melancholy power Of so adoring—with a buried care, And with the o'erflowing of a voiceless prayer, And with a deepening dream, that day by day, In the still shadow of its lonely sway, Folded me closer, till the world held nought Save the one being to my centred thought. There was no music but his voice to hear, No joy but such as with his step drew near; Light was but where he look'd—life where he moved: Silently, fervently, thus, thus I loved. Oh! but such love is fearful!—and I knew Its gathering doom:—the soul's prophetic sight Even then unfolded in my breast, and threw O'er all things round a full, strong, vivid light, Too sorrowfully clear!—an under-tone Was given to Nature's harp, for me alone Whispering of grief.—Of grief?—be strong, awake! Hath not thy love been victory, O, my soul? Hath not its conflict won a voice to shake Death's fastnesses?—a magic to control Worlds far removed?—from o'er the grave to thee Love hath made answer; and thy tale should be Sung like a lay of triumph!—Now return, And take thy treasure from its bosom'd urn, And lift it once to light! In fear, in pain, I said I loved—but yet a heavenly strain Of sweetness floated down the tearful stream, A joy flash'd through the trouble of my dream! I knew myself beloved!—we breathed no vow, No mingling visions might our fate allow, As unto happy hearts; but still and deep, Like a rich jewel gleaming in a grave, Like golden sand in some dark river's wave, So did my soul that costly knowledge keep So jealously!—a thing o'er which to shed, When stars alone beheld the drooping head, Lone tears! yet ofttimes burden'd with the excess Of our strange nature's quivering happiness. But, oh! sweet friend! we dream not of love's might Till death has robed with soft and solemn light The image we enshrine!—Before that hour, We have but glimpses of the o'ermastering power Within us laid!—then doth the spirit-flame With sword-like lightning rend its mortal frame; The wings of that which pants to follow fast Shake their clay-bars, as with a prison'd blast— The sea is in our souls! He died—he died On whom my lone devotedness was cast! I might not keep one vigil by his side, I, whose wrung heart watch'd with him to the last! I might not once his fainting head sustain, Nor bathe his parch'd lips in the hour of pain, Nor say to him, “Farewell!”—He pass'd away— Oh! had my love been there, its conquering sway Had won him back from death!—but thus removed, Borne o'er the abyss no sounding-line hath proved, Join'd with the unknown, the viewless—he became Unto my thoughts another, yet the same— Changed—hallow'd—glorified!—and his low grave Seem'd a bright mournful altar—mine, all mine:— Brother and friend soon left me that sole shrine, The birthright of the faithful!—their world's wave Soon swept them from its brink.—Oh! deem thou not That on the sad and consecrated spot My soul grew weak!—I tell thee that a power There kindled heart and lip—a fiery shower My words were made—a might was given to prayer, And a strong grasp to passionate despair, And a dread triumph!—Know'st thou what I sought? For what high boon my struggling spirit wrought? —Communion with the dead!—I sent a cry, Through the veil'd empires of eternity, A voice to cleave them! By the mournful truth, By the lost promise of my blighted youth, By the strong chain a mighty love can bind On the beloved, the spell of mind o'er mind; By words, which in themselves are magic high, Arm'd and inspired, and wing'd with agony; By tears, which comfort not, but burn, and seem To bear the heart's blood in their passion-stream; I summon'd, I adjured!—with quicken'd sense, With the keen vigil of a life intense, I watch'd, an answer from the winds to wring, I listen'd, if perchance the stream might bring Token from worlds afar: I taught one sound Unto a thousand echoes—one profound Imploring accent to the tomb, the sky— One prayer to-night—“Awake, appear, reply!” Hast thou been told that from the viewless bourne, The dark way never hath allow'd return? That all, which tears can move, with life is fled— That earthly love is powerless on the dead? Believe it not!—there is a large lone star Now burning o'er yon western hill afar, And under its clear light there lies a spot Which well might utter forth—Believe it not! I sat beneath that planet—I had wept My woe to stillness, every night-wind slept; A hush was on the hills; the very streams Went by like clouds, or noiseless founts in dreams, And the dark tree o'ershadowing me that hour, Stood motionless, even as the grey church-tower Whereon I gazed unconsciously:—there came A low sound, like the tremor of a flame, Or like the light quick shiver of a wing, Flitting through twilight woods, across the air; And I look'd up!—Oh! for strong words to bring Conviction o'er thy thought!—Before me there, He, the departed, stood!—Ay, face to face, So near, and yet how far!—his form, his mien, Gave to remembrance back each burning trace Within:—Yet something awfully serene, Pure, sculpture-like, on the pale brow, that wore Of the once beating heart no token more; And stillness on the lip—and o'er the hair A gleam, that trembled through the breathless air; And an unfathom'd calm, that seem'd to lie In the grave sweetness of the illumined eye; Told of the gulfs between our being set, And, as that unsheath'd spirit-glance I met, Made my soul faint:—with fear? Oh! not with fear! With the sick feeling that in his far sphere My love could be as nothing! But he spoke— How shall I tell thee of the startling thrill In that low voice, whose breezy tones could fill My bosom's infinite? O, friend! I woke Then first to heavenly life!—Soft, solemn, clear, Breathed the mysterious accents on mine ear, Yet strangely seem'd as if the while they rose From depths of distance, o'er the wide repose Of slumbering waters wafted, or the dells Of mountains, hollow with sweet echo-cells; But, as they murmur'd on, the mortal chill Pass'd from me, like a mist before the morn, And, to that glorious intercourse upborne By slow degrees, a calm, divinely still, Possess'd my frame: I sought that lighted eye— From its intense and searching purity I drank in soul!—I question'd of the dead— Of the hush'd, starry shores their footsteps tread, And I was answered:—if remembrance there, With dreamy whispers fill the immortal air; If thought, here piled from many a jewel-heap, Be treasure in that pensive land to keep; If love, o'ersweeping change, and blight, and blast Find there the music of his home at last; I ask'd, and I was answer'd:—Full and high Was that communion with eternity, Too rich for aught so fleeting!—Like a knell Swept o'er my sense its closing words, “Farewell, On earth we meet no more!”—and all was gone— The pale bright settled brow—the thrilling tone, The still and shining eye! and never more May twilight gloom or midnight hush restore That radiant guest! One full-fraught hour of heaven, To earthly passion's wild implorings given, Was made my own—the ethereal fire hath shiver'd The fragile censer in whose mould it quiver'd, Brightly, consumingly! What now is left? A faded world, of glory's hues bereft— A void, a chain!—I dwell 'midst throngs, apart, In the cold silence of the stranger's heart; A fix'd, immortal shadow stands between My spirit and life's fast receding scene; A gift hath sever'd me from human ties, A power is gone from all earth's melodies, Which never may return: their chords are broken, The music of another land hath spoken— No after-sound is sweet!—this weary thirst! And I have heard celestial fountains burst!— What here shall quench it? Dost thou not rejoice, When the spring sends forth an awakening voice Through the young woods?—Thou dost!—And in that birth Of early leaves, and flowers, and songs of mirth, Thousands, like thee, find gladness!—Could'st thou know How every breeze then summons me to go! How all the light of love and beauty shed By those rich hours, but woos me to the dead! The only beautiful that change no more— The only loved!—the dwellers on the shore Of spring fulfill'd!—The dead!—whom call we so? They that breathe purer air, that feel, that know Things wrapt from us!—Away!—within me pent, That which is barr'd from its own element Still droops or struggles!—But the day will come— Over the deep the free bird finds its home, And the stream lingers 'midst the rocks, yet greets The sea at last; and the wing'd flower-seed meets A soil to rest in:—shall not I, too, be, My spirit-love! upborne to dwell with thee? Yes! by the power whose conquering anguish stirr'd The tomb, whose cry beyond the stars was heard, Whose agony of triumph won thee back Through the dim pass no mortal step may track, Yet shall we meet!—that glimpse of joy divine Proved thee for ever and for ever mine! THE LADY OF PROVENCE. Founded on an incident in the early French history. “Courage was cast about her like a dress Of solemn comeliness, A gather'd mind and an untroubled face Did give her dangers grace.” Donne. The war-note of the Saracen Was on the winds of France; It had still'd the harp of the Troubadour, And the clash of the tourney's lance. The sounds of the sea, and the sounds of the night, And the hollow echoes of charge and flight, Were around Clotilde, as she knelt to pray In a chapel where the mighty lay, On the old Provençal shore; Many a Chatillon beneath, Unstirr'd by the ringing trumpet's breath, His shroud of armour wore. And the glimpses of moonlight that went and came Through the clouds, like bursts of a dying flame, Gave quivering life to the slumber pale Of stern forms couch'd in their marble mail, At rest on the tombs of the knightly race, The silent throngs of that burial-place. They were imaged there with helm and spear, As leaders in many a bold career, And haughty their stillness look'd and high, Like a sleep whose dreams were of victory; But meekly the voice of the lady rose Through the trophies of their proud repose; Meekly, yet fervently, calling down aid, Under their banners of battle she pray'd; With her pale fair brow, and her eyes of love, Upraised to the Virgin's portray'd above, And her hair flung back, till it swept the grave Of a Chatillon with its gleamy wave. And her fragile frame, at every blast, That full of the savage war-horn pass'd, Trembling, as trembles a bird's quick heart, When it vainly strives from its cage to part— So knelt she in her woe; A weeper alone with the tearless dead— Oh! they reck not of tears o'er their quiet shed. Or the dust had stirr'd below! Hark! a swift step! she hath caught its tone, Through the dash of the sea, through the wild wind's moan;— Is her lord return'd with his conquering bands? No! a breathless vassal before her stands! —“Hast thou been on the field?—Art thou come from the host?” —“From the slaughter, lady!—All, all is lost! Our banners are taken, our knights laid low, Our spearmen chased by the Paynim foe; And thy lord,” his voice took a sadder sound— “Thy lord—he is not on the bloody ground! There are those who tell that the leader's plume Was seen on the flight through th' gathering gloom.” —A change o'er her mien and her spirit pass'd; She ruled the heart which had beat so fast, She dash'd the tears from her kindling eye, With a glance, as of sudden royalty: The proud blood sprang in a fiery flow, Quick o'er bosom, and cheek, and brow, And her young voice rose till the peasant shook At the thrilling tone and the falcon-look: —“Dost thou stand by the tombs of the glorious dead, And fear not to say that their son hath fled? —Away! he is lying by lance and shield,— Point me the path to his battle-field!” The shadows of the forest Are about the lady now; She is hurrying through the midnight on, Beneath the dark pine-bough. There's a murmur of omens in every leaf, There's a wail in the stream like the dirge of a chief; The branches that rock to the tempest strife, Are groaning like things of troubled life; The wind from the battle seems rushing by With a funeral-march through the gloomy sky; The pathway is rugged, and wild, and long, But her frame in the daring of love is strong, And her soul as on swelling seas upborne, And girded all fearful things to scorn. And fearful things were around her spread, When she reach'd the field of the warrior-dead; There lay the noble, the valiant, low— Ay! but one word speaks of deeper woe; There lay the loved—on each fallen head Mothers' vain blessings and tears had shed; Sisters were watching in many a home For the fetter'd footstep, no more to come; Names in the prayer of that night were spoken, Whose claim unto kindred prayer was broken; And the fire was heap'd, and the bright wine pour'd, For those, now needing nor hearth nor board; Only a requiem, a shroud, a knell, And oh! ye beloved of women, farewell! Silently, with lips compress'd, Pale hands clasp'd above her breast, Stately brow of anguish high, Deathlike cheek, but dauntless eye; Silently, o'er that red plain, Moved the lady 'midst the slain. Sometimes it seem'd as a charging cry, Or the ringing tramp of a steed, came nigh; Sometimes a blast of the Paynim horn, Sudden and shrill from the mountains borne; And her maidens trembled;—but on her ear No meaning fell with those sounds of fear; They had less of mastery to shake her now, Than the quivering, erewhile, of an aspen-bough. She search'd into many an unclosed eye, That look'd, without soul, to the starry sky; She bow'd down o'er many a shatter'd breast, She lifted up helmet and cloven crest— Not there, not there he lay! “Lead where the most hath been dared and done, Where the heart of the battle hath bled,—lead on!” And the vassal took the way. He turn'd to a dark and lonely tree That waved o'er a fountain red; Oh! swiftest there had the currents free From noble veins been shed. Thickest there the spear-heads gleam'd, And the scatter'd plumage stream'd, And the broken shields were toss'd, And the shiver'd lances cross'd, And the mail-clad sleepers round Made the harvest of that ground. He was there! the leader amidst his band Where the faithful had made their last vain stand; He was there! but affection's glance alone The darkly-changed in that hour had known; With the falchion yet in his cold hand grasp'd, And a banner of France to his bosom clasp'd, And the form that of conflict bore fearful trace, And the face—oh! speak not of that dead face! As it lay to answer love's look no more, Yet never so proudly loved before! She quell'd in her soul the deep floods of woe, The time was not yet for their waves to flow; She felt the full presence, the might of death, Yet there came no sob with her struggling breath, And a proud smile shone o'er her pale despair, As she turn'd to his followers—“Your lord is there! Look on him! know him by scarf and crest!— Bear him away with his sires to rest!” Another day, another night, And the sailor on the deep Hears the low chant of a funeral rite From the lordly chapel sweep. It comes with a broken and muffled tone, As if that rite were in terror done; Yet the song 'midst the seas hath a thrilling power, And he knows 'tis a chieftain's burial hour. Hurriedly, in fear and woe, Through the aisle the mourners go; With a hush'd and stealthy tread, Bearing on the noble dead; Sheath'd in armour of the field— Only his wan face reveal'd, Whence the still and solemn gleam Doth a strange sad contrast seem To the anxious eyes of that pale band, With torches wavering in every hand, For they dread each moment the shout of war, And the burst of the Moslem scimitar. There is no plumed head o'er the bier to bend, No brother of battle, no princely friend: No sound comes back like the sounds of yore, Unto sweeping swords from the marble floor; By the red fountain the valiant lie, The flower of Provençal chivalry; But one free step, and one lofty heart, Bear through that scene to the last their part. She hath led the death-train of the brave To the verge of his own ancestral grave; She hath held o'er her spirit long rigid sway, But the struggling passion must now have way; In the cheek, half seen through her mourning veil, By turns does the swift blood flush and fail; The pride on the lip is lingering still, But it shakes as a flame to the blast might thrill; Anguish and triumph are met at strife, Rending the cords of her frail young life; And she sinks at last on her warrior's bier, Lifting her voice, as if death might hear.— “I have won thy fame from the breath of wrong, My soul hath risen for thy glory strong! Now call me hence, by thy side to be, The world thou leav'st has no place for me. The light goes with thee, the joy, the worth— Faithful and tender! Oh! call me forth! Give me my home on thy noble heart,— Well have we loved, let us both depart!”— And pale on the breast of the dead she lay, The living cheek to the cheek of clay; The living cheek!—Oh! it was not vain, That strife of the spirit to rend its chain; She is there at rest in her place of pride, In death how queen-like—a glorious bride! Joy for the freed one!—she might not stay When the crown had fallen from her life away; She might not linger—a weary thing, A dove with no home for its broken wing, Thrown on the harshness of alien skies, That know not its own land's melodies. From the long heart-withering early gone; She hath lived—she hath loved—her task is done! THE CORONATION OF INEZ DE CASTRO. “Tableau, où l'Amour fait alliance avec la Tombe; union redoutable de la mort et de la vie!”—Madame de Stael. There was music on the midnight: From a royal fane it roll'd, And a mighty bell, each pause between, Sternly and slowly toll'd. Strange was their mingling in the sky, It hush'd the listener's breath; For the music spoke of triumph high, The lonely bell, of death. There was hurrying through the midnight A sound of many feet; But they fell with a muffled fearfulness Along the shadowy street: And softer, fainter, grew their tread, As it near'd the minster gate, Whence a broad and solemn light was shed From a scene of royal state. Full glow'd the strong red radiance In the centre of the nave, Where the folds of a purple canopy Swept down in many a wave; Loading the marble pavement old With a weight of gorgeous gloom, For something lay 'midst their fretted gold, Like a shadow of the tomb. And within that rich pavilion, High on a glittering throne, A woman's form sat silently, 'Midst the glare of light alone. Her jewell'd robes fell strangely still— The drapery on her breast Seem'd with no pulse beneath to thrill, So stonelike was its rest! But a peal of lordly music Shook e'en the dust below, When the burning gold of the diadem Was set on her pallid brow! Then died away that haughty sound, And from the encircling band Stepp'd prince and chief, 'midst the hush profound, With homage to her hand. Why pass'd a faint, cold shuddering Over each martial frame, As one by one, to touch that hand, Noble and leader came? Was not the settled aspect fair? Did not a queenly grace, Under the parted ebon hair, Sit on the pale still face? Death! death! canst thou be lovely Unto the eye of life? Is not each pulse of the quick high breast With thy cold mien at strife? —It was a strange and fearful sight, The crown upon that head, The glorious robes, and the blaze of light, All gather'd round the Dead! And beside her stood in silence One with a brow as pale, And white lips rigidly compress'd, Lest the strong heart should fail: King Pedro, with a jealous eye, Watching the homage done, By the land's flower and chivalry, To her, his martyr'd one. But on the face he looked not, Which once his star had been; To every form his glance was turn'd, Save of the breathless queen: Though something, won from the grave's embrace, Of her beauty still was there, Its hues were all of that shadowy place, It was not for him to bear. Alas! the crown, the sceptre, The treasures of the earth, And the priceless love that pour'd those gifts, Alike of wasted worth! The rites are closed:—bear back the dead Unto the chamber deep! Lay down again the royal head, Dust with the dust to sleep! There is music on the midnight— A requiem sad and slow, As the mourners through the sounding aisle In dark procession go; And the ring of state, and the starry crown, And all the rich array, Are borne to the house of silence down, With her, that queen of clay! And tearlessly and firmly King Pedro led the train; But his face was wrapt in his folding robe, When they lower'd the dust again. 'Tis hush'd at last the tomb above, Hymns die, and steps depart: Who call'd thee strong as Death, O Love? Mightier thou wast and art. ITALIAN GIRL'S HYMN TO THE VIRGIN. “O sanctissima, O purissima! Dulcis Virgo Maria, Mater amata, intemerata, Ora, ora pro nobis.” Sicilian Mariner's Hymn. In the deep hour of dreams, Through the dark woods, and past the moaning sea, And by the star-light gleams, Mother of sorrows! lo, I come to thee! Unto thy shrine I bear Night-blowing flowers, like my own heart, to lie All, all unfolded there, Beneath the meekness of thy pitying eye. For thou, that once did'st move, In thy still beauty, through an early home, Thou know'st the grief, the love, The fear of woman's soul;—to thee I come! Many, and sad, and deep, Were the thoughts folded in thy silent breast; Thou, too, could'st watch and weep— Hear, gentlest mother! hear a heart oppress'd! There is a wandering bark Bearing one from me o'er the restless wave: Oh! let thy soft eye mark His course;—be with him, holiest, guide and save! My soul is on that way; My thoughts are travellers o'er the waters dim; Through the long weary day I walk, o'ershadow'd by vain dreams of him. Aid him—and me, too, aid! Oh! 'tis not well, this earthly love's excess! On thy weak child is laid The burden of too deep a tenderness. Too much o'er him is pour'd My being's hope—scarce leaving Heaven a part; Too fearfully adored, Oh! make not him the chastener of my heart! I tremble with a sense Of grief to be;—I hear a warning low— Sweet mother! call me hence! This wild idolatry must end in woe. The troubled joy of life, Love's lightning happiness, my soul hath known; And, worn with feverish strife, Would fold its wings; take back, take back thine own! Hark! how the wind swept by! The tempest's voice comes rolling o'er the wave— Hope of the sailor's eye, And maiden's heart, blest mother, guide and save! TO A DEPARTED SPIRIT. From the bright stars, or from the viewless air, Or from some world unreach'd by human thought, Spirit, sweet spirit! if thy home be there, And if thy visions with the past be fraught, Answer me, answer me! Have we not communed here of life and death? Have we not said that love, such love as ours, Was not to perish as a rose's breath, To melt away, like song from festal bowers? Answer, oh! answer me! Thine eye's last light was mine—the soul that shone Intensely, mournfully, through gathering haze— Did'st thou bear with thee to the shore unknown, Nought of what lived in that long, earnest gaze! Hear, hear, and answer me! Thy voice—its low, soft, fervent, farewell tone Thrill'd through the tempest of the parting strife, Like a faint breeze:—oh! from that music flown, Send back one sound, if love's be quenchless life, But once, oh! answer me! In the still noontide, in the sunset's hush, In the dead hour of night, when thought grows deep, When the heart's phantoms from the darkness rush, Fearfully beautiful, to strive with sleep— Spirit! then answer me! By the remembrance of our blended prayer; By all our tears, whose mingling made them sweet; By our last hope, the victor o'er despair;— Speak! if our souls in deathless yearnings meet; Answer me, answer me! The grave is silent:—and the far-off sky, And the deep midnight—silent all, and lone! Oh! if thy buried love make no reply, What voice has earth?—Hear, pity, speak, mine own! Answer me, answer me! THE CHAMOIS HUNTER'S LOVE. “For all his wildness and proud phantasies, I love him!” Croly. Thy heart is in the upper world, where fleet the chamois bounds, Thy heart is where the mountain-fir shakes to the torrent-sounds; And where the snow-peaks gleam like stars, through the stillness of the air, And where the Lauwine's Lauwine, the avalanche. peal is heard—Hunter! thy heart is there! I know thou lov'st me well, dear friend! but better, better far, Thou lov'st that high and haughty life, with rocks and storms at war; In the green sunny vales with me, thy spirit would but pine, And yet I will be thine, my love! and yet I will be thine! And I will not seek to woo thee down from those thy native heights, With the sweet song, our land's own song, of pastoral delights; For thou must live as eagles live, thy path is not as mine, And yet I will be thine, my love! and yet I will be thine. And I will leave my blessed home, my father's joyous hearth, With all the voices meeting there in tenderness and mirth, With all the kind and laughing eyes, that in its firelight shine, To sit forsaken in thy hut, yet know that thou art mine! It is my youth, it is my bloom, it is my glad free heart, That I cast away for thee—for thee, all reckless as thou art! With tremblings and with vigils lone, I bind myself to dwell, Yet, yet I would not change that lot, oh no! I love too well! A mournful thing is love which grows to one so wild as thou, With that bright restlessness of eye, that tameless fire of brow! Mournful!—but dearer far I call its mingled fear and pride, And the trouble of its happiness, than aught on earth beside. To listen for thy step in vain, to start at every breath, To watch through long long nights of storm, to sleep and dream of death, To wake in doubt and loneliness—this doom I know is mine, And yet I will be thine, my love! and yet I will be thine! That I may greet thee from thine Alps, when thence thou comest at last, That I may hear thy thrilling voice tell o'er each danger past, That I may kneel and pray for thee, and win thee aid divine, For this I will be thine, my love! for this I will be thine! THE INDIAN WITH HIS DEAD CHILD. In the silence of the midnight I journey with my dead; In the darkness of the forest-boughs A lonely path I tread. But my heart is high and fearless, As by mighty wings upborne; The mountain eagle hath not plumes So strong as love and scorn. I have raised thee from the grave-sod, By the white man's path defiled; On to th' ancestral wilderness, I bear thy dust, my child! I have ask'd the ancient deserts To give my dead a place, Where the stately footsteps of the free Alone should leave a trace. And the tossing pines made answer— “Go, bring us back thine own!” And the streams from all the hunters' hills, Rush'd with an echoing tone. Thou shalt rest by sounding waters That yet untamed may roll; The voices of that chainless host With joy shall fill thy soul. In the silence of the midnight I journey with the dead, Where the arrows of my father's bow Their falcon flight have sped. I have left the spoilers' dwellings For evermore behind; Unmingled with their household sounds, For me shall sweep the wind. Alone, amidst their hearth-fires, I watch'd my child's decay, Uncheer'd, I saw the spirit-light From his young eyes fade away. When his head sank on my bosom, When the death-sleep o'er him fell, Was there one to say, “A friend is near?” There was none!—pale race, farewell! To the forests, to the cedars, To the warrior and his bow, Back, back!—I bore thee laughing thence, I bear thee slumbering now! I bear thee unto burial With the mighty hunters gone; I shall hear thee in the forest-breeze, Thou wilt speak of joy, my son! In the silence of the midnight I journey with the dead; But my heart is strong, my step is fleet, My father's path I tread. SONG OF EMIGRATION. There was heard a song on the chiming sea, A mingled breathing of grief and glee; Man's voice, unbroken by sighs, was there, Filling with triumph the sunny air; Of fresh green lands, and of pastures new, It sang, while the bark through the surges flew. But ever and anon A murmur of farewell Told, by its plaintive tone, That from woman's lip it fell. “Away, away o'er the foaming main!” This was the free and the joyous strain, “There are clearer skies than ours, afar, We will shape our course by a brighter star; There are plains whose verdure no foot hath press'd, And whose wealth is all for the first brave guest” “But, alas! that we should go,” Sang the farewell voices then, “From the homesteads, warm and low, By the brook and in the glen!” “We will rear new homes under trees that glow, As if gems were the fruitage of every bough; O'er our white walls we will train the vine, And sit in its shadow at day's decline; And watch our herds, as they range at will Through the green savannas, all bright and still. “But woe for that sweet shade Of the flowering orchard-trees, Where first our children play'd 'Midst the birds and honey-bees! “All, all our own shall the forests be, As to the bound of the roebuck free! None shall say, ‘Hither, no further pass!’ We will track each step through the wavy grass; We will chase the elk in his speed and might, And bring proud spoils to the hearth at night.” “But, oh! the grey church-tower, And the sound of Sabbath-bell, And the shelter'd garden-bower, We have bid them all farewell! “We will give the names of our fearless race To each bright river whose course we trace; We will leave our memory with mounts and floods, And the path of our daring in boundless woods! And our works unto many a lake's green shore, Where the Indian's graves lay, alone, before.” “But who shall teach the flowers, Which our children loved, to dwell In a soil that is not ours? —Home, home and friends, farewell!” THE KING OF ARRAGON'S LAMENT FOR HIS BROTHER. “If I could see him, it were well with me!” Coleridge's Wallenstein. There were lights and sounds of revelling in the vanquish'd city's halls, As by night the feast of victory was held within its walls; And the conquerors fill'd the wine-cup high, after years of bright blood shed; But their lord, the King of Arragon, 'midst the triumph, wail'd the dead. He look'd down from the fortress won, on the tents and towers below, The moonlit sea, the torchlit streets—and a gloom came o'er his brow: The voice of thousands floated up, with the horn and cymbal's tone; But his heart, 'midst that proud music, felt more utterly alone. And he cried, “Thou art mine, fair city! thou city of the sea! But, oh! what portion of delight is mine at last in thee?— I am lonely 'midst thy palaces, while the glad waves past them roll, And the soft breath of thine orange-bowers is mournful to my soul. “My brother! oh, my brother! thou art gone—the true and brave, And the haughty joy of victory hath died upon thy grave; There are many round my throne to stand, and to march where I lead on; There was one to love me in the world—my brother! thou art gone! “In the desert, in the battle, in the ocean-tempest's wrath, We stood together, side by side; one hope was ours—one path; Thou hast wrapp'd me in thy soldier's cloak, thou hast fenced me with thy breast; Thou hast watch'd beside my couch of pain—oh! bravest heart, and best! “I see the festive lights around;—o'er a dull sad world they shine; I hear the voice of victory—my Pedro! where is thine? The only voice in whose kind tone my spirit found reply!— Oh, brother! I have bought too dear this hollow pageantry! “I have hosts, and gallant fleets, to spread my glory and my sway, And chiefs to lead them fearlessly;—my friend hath pass'd away! For the kindly look, the word of cheer, my heart may thirst in vain, And the face that was as light to mine—it cannot come again! “I have made thy blood, thy faithful blood, the offering for a crown; With love, which earth bestows not twice, I have purchased cold renown; How often will my weary heart 'midst the sounds of triumph die, When I think of thee, my brother! thou flower of chivalry! “I am lonely—I am lonely! this rest is even as death! Let me hear again the ringing spears, and the battle-trumpet's breath; Let me see the fiery charger foam, and the royal banner wave— But where art thou, my brother? where?—in thy low and early grave!” And louder swell'd the songs of joy through that victorious night, And faster flow'd the red wine forth, by the stars' and torches' light; But low and deep, amidst the mirth, was heard the conqueror's moan— “My brother! oh, my brother! best and bravest! thou art gone!” THE RETURN. “Hast thou come with the heart of thy childhood back? The free, the pure, the kind?” —So murmur'd the trees in my homeward track, As they play'd to the mountain-wind. “Hath thy soul been true to its early love?” Whisper'd my native streams; “Hath the spirit nursed amidst hill and grove, Still revered its first high dreams?” “Hast thou borne in thy bosom the holy prayer Of the child in his parent-halls?” —Thus breathed a voice on the thrilling air, From the old ancestral walls. “Hast thou kept thy faith with the faithful dead, Whose place of rest is nigh? With the father's blessing o'er thee shed, With the mother's trusting eye?” —Then my tears gush'd forth in sudden rain, As I answer'd—“O, ye shades! I bring not my childhood's heart again To the freedom of your glades. “I have turn'd from my first pure love aside, O bright and happy streams! Light after light, in my soul have died The day-spring's glorious dreams. “And the holy prayer from my thoughts hath pass'd— The prayer at my mother's knee; Darken'd and troubled I come at last, Home of my boyish glee! “But I bear from my childhood a gift of tears, To soften and atone; And oh! ye scenes of those bless'd years, They shall make me again your own.” THE VAUDOIS' WIFE. “Clasp me a little longer, on the brink Of fate! while I can feel thy dear caress; And when this heart hath ceased to beat, oh! think— And let it mitigate thy woe's excess— That thou hast been to me all tenderness, And friend, to more than human friendship just. Oh! by that retrospect of happiness, And by the hopes of an immortal trust, God shall assuage thy pangs, when I am laid in dust.” Gertrude of Wyoming. Thy voice is in mine ear, beloved! Thy look is in my heart, Thy bosom is my resting-place, And yet I must depart. Earth on my soul is strong—too strong— Too precious is its chain, All woven of thy love, dear friend, Yet vain—though mighty—vain! Thou see'st mine eye grow dim, beloved! Thou see'st my life-blood flow.— Bow to the chastener silently, And calmly let me go! A little while between our hearts The shadowy gulf must lie, Yet have we for their communing Still, still Eternity! Alas! thy tears are on my cheek, My spirit they detain; I know that from thine agony Is wrung that burning rain. Best, kindest, weep not;—make the pang, The bitter conflict, less— Oh! sad it is, and yet a joy, To feel thy love's excess! But calm thee! Let the thought of death A solemn peace restore! The voice that must be silent soon, Would speak to thee once more, That thou may'st bear its blessing on Through years of after life— A token of consoling love, Even from this hour of strife. I bless thee for the noble heart, The tender, and the true, Where mine hath found the happiest rest That e'er fond woman's knew; I bless thee, faithful friend and guide, For my own, my treasured share, In the mournful secrets of thy soul, In thy sorrow, in thy prayer. I bless thee for kind looks and words Shower'd on my path like dew, For all the love in those deep eyes, A gladness ever new! For the voice which ne'er to mine replied But in kindly tones of cheer; For every spring of happiness My soul hath tasted here! I bless thee for the last rich boon Won from affection tried, The right to gaze on death with thee, To perish by thy side! And yet more for the glorious hope Even to these moments given— Did not thy spirit ever lift The trust of mine to Heaven? Now be thou strong! Oh, knew we not Our path must lead to this? A shadow and a trembling still Were mingled with our bliss! We plighted our young hearts when storms Were dark upon the sky, In full, deep knowledge of their task To suffer and to die! Be strong! I leave the living voice Of this, my martyr'd blood, With the thousand echoes of the hills, With the torrent's foaming flood,— A spirit 'midst the caves to dwell, A token on the air, To rouse the valiant from repose, The fainting from despair. Hear it and bear thou on, my love! Ay, joyously endure! Our mountains must be altars yet, Inviolate and pure; There must our God be worshipp'd still With the worship of the free: Farewell!—there's but one pang in death, One only,—leaving thee! THE GUERILLA LEADER'S VOW. “All my pretty ones! Did you say all? Let us make medicine of this great revenge, To cure this deadly grief!” Macbeth. My battle-vow!—no minster walls Gave back the burning word, Nor cross nor shrine the low deep tone Of smother'd vengeance heard: But the ashes of a ruin'd home Thrill'd, as it sternly rose, With the mingling voice of blood that shook The midnight's dark repose. I breathed it not o'er kingly tombs, But where my children lay, And the startled vulture, at my step, Soar'd from their precious clay. I stood amidst my dead alone— I kiss'd their lips—I pour'd, In the strong silence of that hour, My spirit on my sword. The roof-tree fallen, the smouldering floor, The blacken'd threshold-stone, The bright hair torn, and soil'd with blood, Whose fountain was my own; These, and the everlasting hills, Bore witness that wild night; Before them rose th' avenger's soul, In crush'd affection's might. The stars, the searching stars of heaven, With keen looks would upbraid, If from my heart the fiery vow, Sear'd on it then, could fade They have no cause!—Go, ask the streams That by my paths have swept, The red waves that unstain'd were borne— How hath my faith been kept? And other eyes are on my soul, That never, never close, The sad, sweet glances of the lost— They leave me no repose. Haunting my night-watch 'midst the rocks, And by the torrent's foam, Through the dark-rolling mists they shine, Full, full of love and home! Alas! the mountain eagle's heart, When wrong'd, may yet find rest; Scorning the place made desolate, He seeks another nest. But I—your soft looks wake the thirst That wins no quenching rain; Ye drive me back, my beautiful! To the stormy fight again. THEKLA AT HER LOVER'S GRAVE. See Wallenstein, Act 6th. “Thither where he lies buried! That single spot is the whole world to me.” Coleridge's Wallenstein. Thy voice was in my soul! it call'd me on; O my lost friend! thy voice was in my soul: From the cold, faded world whence thou art gone, To hear no more life's troubled billows roll, I come, I come! Now speak to me again! we loved so well— We loved! oh! still, I know that still we love! I have left all things with thy dust to dwell, Through these dim aisles in dreams of thee to rove: This is my home! Speak to me in the thrilling minster's gloom! Speak! thou hast died, and sent me no farewell! I will not shrink;—oh! mighty is the tomb, But one thing mightier, which it cannot quell, This woman's heart! This lone, full, fragile heart!—the strong alone In love and grief—of both the burning shrine! Thou, my soul's friend! with grief hast surely done, But with the love which made thy spirit mine, Say, could'st thou part? I hear the rustling banners; and I hear The wind's low singing through the fretted stone; I hear not thee; and yet I feel thee near— What is this bound that keeps thee from thine own? Breathe it away! I wait thee—I adjure thee! hast thou known How I have loved thee? could'st thou dream it all? Am I not here, with night and death alone, And fearing not? and hath my spirit's call O'er thine no sway? Thou canst not come! or thus I should not weep! Thy love is deathless—but no longer free! Soon would its wing triumphantly o'ersweep The viewless barrier, if such power might be, Soon, soon, and fast! But I shall come to thee! our souls' deep dreams, Our young affections, have not gush'd in vain; Soon in one tide shall blend the sever'd streams, The worn heart break its bonds—and death and pain Be with the past! THE SISTERS OF SCIO. “As are our hearts, our way is one, And cannot be divided. Strong affection Contends with all things and o'ercometh all things. Will I not live with thee? will I not cheer thee? Would'st thou be lonely then? would'st thou be sad?” Joanna Baillie. “Sister, sweet sister! let me weep awhile! Bear with me—give the sudden passion way! Thoughts of our own lost home, our sunny isle, Come, as a wind that o'er a reed hath sway; Till my heart dies with yearnings and sick fears;— Oh! could my life melt from me in these tears! “Our father's voice, our mother's gentle eye, Our brother's bounding step—where are they, where? Desolate, desolate our chambers lie! —How hast thou won thy spirit from despair? O'er mine swift shadows, gusts of terror, sweep;— I sink away—bear with me—let me weep!” “Yes! weep my sister! weep, till from thy heart The weight flow forth in tears! yet sink thou not; I bind my sorrow to a lofty part, For thee, my gentle one! our orphan lot To meet in quenchless trust; my soul is strong— Thou, too, wilt rise in holy might ere long. “A breath of our free heavens and noble sires, A memory of our old victorious dead,— These mantle me with power! and though their fires In a frail censer briefly may be shed, Yet shall they light us onward, side by side;— Have the wild birds, and have not we, a guide? “Cheer, then, beloved! on whose meek brow is set Our mother's image—in whose voice a tone, A faint sweet sound of hers is lingering yet, An echo of our childhood's music gone;— Cheer thee! thy sister's heart and faith are high: Our path is one—with thee I live and die!” BERNARDO DEL CARPIO. The warrior bow'd his crested head, and tamed his heart of fire, And sued the haughty king to free his long-imprison'd sire; “I bring thee here my fortress keys, I bring my captive train, I pledge thee faith, my liege, my lord!—oh, break my father's chain!” “Rise, rise! even now thy father comes, a ransom'd man this day: Mount thy good horse, and thou and I will meet him on his way.” Then lightly rose that loyal son, and bounded on his steed, And urged, as if with lance in rest, the charger's foamy speed. And lo! from far, as on they press'd, there came a glittering band, With one that 'midst them stately rode, as a leader in the land; “Now haste, Bernardo, haste! for there, in very truth, is he, The father whom thy faithful heart hath yearn'd so long to see.” His dark eye flash'd, his proud breast heaved, his cheek's blood came and went; He reach'd that grey-hair'd chieftain's side, and there, dismounting, bent; A lowly knee to earth he bent, his father's hand he took,— What was there in its touch that all his fiery spirit shook? That hand was cold—a frozen thing—it dropp'd from his like lead,— He look'd up to the face above—the face was of the dead! A plume waved o'er the noble brow—the brow was fix'd and white— He met at last his father's eyes—but in them was no sight! Up from the ground he sprung, and gazed, but who could paint that gaze? They hush'd their very hearts, that saw its horror and amaze; They might have chain'd him, as before that stony form he stood, For the power was stricken from his arm, and from his lip the blood. “Father!” at length he murmur'd low—and wept like childhood then,— Talk not of grief till thou hast seen the tears of warlike men!— He thought on all his glorious hopes, and all his young renown,— He flung the falchion from his side, and in the dust sate down. Then covering with his steel-gloved hands his darkly mournful brow “No more, there is no more,” he said, “to lift the sword for now.— My king is false, my hope betray'd, my father—oh! the worth, The glory, and the loveliness, are pass'd away from earth! “I thought to stand where banners waved, my sire! beside thee yet, I would that there our kindred blood on Spain's free soil had met,— Thou would'st have known my spirit then—for thee my fields were won,— And thou hast perish'd in thy chains, as though thou had'st no son!” “Then, starting from the ground once more, he seized the monarch's rein, Amidst the pale and wilder'd looks of all the courtier train; And with a fierce, o'ermastering grasp, the rearing war-horse led, And sternly set them face to face—the king before the dead!— “Came I not forth upon thy pledge, my father's hand to kiss?— Be still, and gaze thou on, false king! and tell me what is this! The voice, the glance, the heart I sought—give answer, where are they?— If thou would'st clear thy perjured soul, send life through this cold clay! “Into these glassy eyes put light—be still! keep down thine ire,— Bid these white lips a blessing speak—this earth is not my sire! Give me back him for whom I strove, for whom my blood was shed,— Thou canst not—and a king?—His dust be mountains on thy head!” He loosed the steed; his slack hand fell—upon the silent face He cast one long, deep, troubled look—then turn'd from that sad place: His hope was crush'd, his after-fate untold in martial strain,— His banner led the spears no more amidst the hills of Spain. THE TOMB OF MADAME LANGHANS. At Hindlebank, near Berne, she is represented as bursting from the sepulchre, with her infant in her arms, at the sound of the last trumpet. An inscription on the tomb concludes thus:—“Here am I, O God! with the child whom thou hast given me.” “To a mysteriously consorted pair This place is consecrate; to death and life, And to the best affections that proceed From this conjunction.” Wordsworth. How many hopes were borne upon thy bier, O bride of stricken love! in anguish hither! Like flowers, the first and fairest of the year Pluck'd on the bosom of the dead to wither; Hopes from their source all holy, though of earth, All brightly gathering round affection's hearth. Of mingled prayer they told; of Sabbath hours; Of morn's farewell, and evening's blessed meeting; Of childhood's voice, amidst the household bowers; And bounding step, and smile of joyous greeting;— But thou, young mother! to thy gentle heart Did'st take thy babe, and meekly so depart. How many hopes have sprung in radiance hence! Their trace yet lights the dust where thou art sleeping! A solemn joy comes o'er me, and a sense Of triumph, blent with nature's gush of weeping, As, kindling up the silent stone, I see The glorious vision, caught by faith, of thee. Slumberer! love calls thee, for the night is past; Put on the immortal beauty of thy waking! Captive! and hear'st thou not the trumpet's blast, The long, victorious note, thy bondage breaking? Thou hear'st, thou answer'st, “God of earth and heaven! Here am I, with the child whom thou hast given!” THE EXILE'S DIRGE. “Fear no more the heat o' the sun, Nor the furious winter's rages, Thou thy worldly task hast done, Home art gone and ta'en thy wages.” Cymbeline. There went a dirge through the forest's gloom. —An exile was borne to a lonely tomb. “Brother!” (so the chant was sung In the slumberer's native tongue,) “Friend and brother! not for thee Shall the sound of weeping be: Long the exile's woe hath lain On thy life a withering chain; Music from thine own blue streams, Wander'd through thy fever-dreams; Voices from thy country's vines, Met thee 'midst the alien pines; And thy true heart died away, And thy spirit would not stay.” So swell'd the chant; and the deep wind's moan Seem'd through the cedars to murmur—“Gone!” “Brother! by the rolling Rhine Stands the home that once was thine; Brother! now thy dwelling lies Where the Indian arrow flies! He that bless'd thine infant head, Fills a distant greensward bed; She that heard thy lisping prayer, Slumbers low beside him there; They that earliest with thee play'd, Rest beneath their own oak shade, Far, far hence!—yet sea nor shore Haply, brother! part ye more; God hath call'd thee to that band In the immortal Fatherland!” “The Fatherland!”—with that sweet word A burst of tears 'midst the strain was heard. “Brother! were we there with thee Rich would many a meeting be! Many a broken garland bound, Many a mourn'd and lost one found! But our task is still to bear, Still to breathe in changeful air; Loved and bright things to resign, As even now this dust of thine; Yet to hope!—to hope in heaven, Though flowers fall, and ties be riven— Yet to pray! and wait the hand Beckoning to the Fatherland!” And the requiem died in the forest's gloom; They had reach'd the exile's lonely tomb. THE DREAMING CHILD. “Alas! what kind of grief should thy years know? Thy brow and cheek are smooth as waters be When no breath troubles them.” Beaumont and Fletcher. And is there sadness in thy dreams, my boy? What should the cloud be made of?—blessed child! Thy spirit, borne upon a breeze of joy, All day hath ranged through sunshine, clear, yet mild: And now thou tremblest!—wherefore?—in thy soul There lies no past, no future.—Thou hast heard No sound of presage from the distance roll, Thy heart bears traces of no arrowy word. From thee no love hath gone; thy mind's young eye Hath look'd not into death's, and thence become A questioner of mute eternity, A weary searcher for a viewless home: Nor hath thy sense been quicken'd unto pain, By feverish watching for some step beloved; Free are thy thoughts, an ever-changeful train, Glancing like dewdrops, and as lightly moved. Yet now, on billows of strange passion toss'd, How art thou wilder'd in the cave of sleep! My gentle child! 'midst what dim phantoms lost, Thus in mysterious anguish dost thou weep? Awake! they sadden me—those early tears, First gushings of the strong dark river's flow, That must o'ersweep thy soul with coming years Th' unfathomable flood of human woe! Awful to watch, even rolling through a dream, Forcing wild spray-drops but from childhood's eyes! Wake, wake! as yet thy life's transparent stream Should wear the tinge of none but summer skies. Come from the shadow of those realms unknown, Where now thy thoughts dismay'd and darkling rove; Come to the kindly region all thine own, The home, still bright for thee with guardian love. Happy, fair child! that yet a mother's voice Can win thee back from visionary strife!— Oh, shall my soul, thus waken'd to rejoice, Start from the dreamlike wilderness of life? THE CHARMED PICTURE. See Frontispiece to vol. vii. “Oh! that those lips had language!—Life hath pass'd With me but roughly since I saw thee last.” Cowper. Thine eyes are charm'd—thine earnest eyes— Thou image of the dead! A spell within their sweetness lies, A virtue thence is shed. Oft in their meek blue light enshrined, A blessing seems to be, And sometimes there my wayward mind A still reproach can see: And sometimes pity—soft and deep, And quivering through a tear; Even as if love in heaven could weep, For grief left drooping here. And oh, my spirit needs that balm! Needs it 'midst fitful mirth! And in the night-hour's haunted calm, And by the lonely hearth. Look on me thus, when hollow praise Hath made the weary pine For one true tone of other days, One glance of love like thine! Look on me thus, when sudden glee Bears my quick heart along, On wings that struggle to be free, As bursts of skylark song. In vain, in vain!—too soon are felt The wounds they cannot flee; Better in childlike tears to melt, Pouring my soul on thee! Sweet face, that o'er my childhood shone, Whence is thy power of change, Thus ever shadowing back my own, The rapid and the strange? Whence are they charm'd—those earnest eyes? —I know the mystery well! In mine own trembling bosom lies The spirit of the spell! Of Memory, Conscience, Love, 'tis born— Oh! change no longer, thou! For ever be the blessing worn On thy pure thoughtful brow! PARTING WORDS. “One struggle more, and I am free.” Byron. Leave me, oh! leave me!—unto all below Thy presence binds me with too deep a spell; Thou makest those mortal regions, whence I go, Too mighty in their loveliness—farewell, That I may part in peace! Leave me!—thy footstep, with its lightest sound, The very shadow of thy waving hair, Wakes in my soul a feeling too profound, Too strong for aught that loves and dies, to bear— Oh! bid the conflict cease! I hear thy whisper—and the warm tears gush Into mine eyes, the quick pulse thrills my heart; Thou bidd'st the peace, the reverential hush, The still submission, from my thoughts depart; Dear one! this must not be. The past looks on me from thy mournful eye, The beauty of our free and vernal days; Our communings with sea, and hill, and sky— Oh! take that bright world from my spirit's gaze! Thou art all earth to me! Shut out the sunshine from my dying room, The jasmine's breath, the murmur of the bee; Let not the joy of bird-notes pierce the gloom! They speak of love, of summer, and of thee, Too much—and death is here! Doth our own spring make happy music now, From the old beech-roots flashing into day? Are the pure lilies imaged in its flow? Alas! vain thoughts! that fondly thus can stray From the dread hour so near! If I could but draw courage from the light Of thy clear eye, that ever shone to bless! —Not now! 'twill not be now!—my aching sight Drinks from that fount a flood of tenderness, Bearing all strength away! Leave me!—thou comest between my heart and Heaven I would be still, in voiceless prayer to die! —Why must our souls thus love, and then be riven? —Return! thy parting wakes mine agony! —Oh, yet awhile delay! THE MESSAGE TO THE DEAD. Thou'rt passing hence, my brother! Oh! my earliest friend, farewell! Thou'rt leaving me, without thy voice, In a lonely home to dwell; And from the hills, and from the hearth, And from the household-tree, With thee departs the lingering mirth, The brightness goes with thee. But thou, my friend, my brother! Thou'rt speeding to the shore Where the dirgelike tone of parting words Shall smite the soul no more! And thou wilt see our holy dead, The lost on earth and main: Into the sheaf of kindred hearts, Thou wilt be bound again! Tell, then, our friend of boyhood, That yet his name is heard On the blue mountains, whence his youth Pass'd like a swift bright bird. The light of his exulting brow, The vision of his glee, Are on me still—Oh! still I trust That smile again to see. And tell our fair young sister The rose cut down in spring, That yet my gushing soul is fill'd With lays she loved to sing. Her soft, deep eyes look through my dreams, Tender and sadly sweet;— Tell her my heart within me burns Once more that gaze to meet And tell our white-hair'd father, That in the paths he trode, The child he loved, the last on earth, Yet walks and worships God. Say, that his last fond blessing yet Rests on my soul like dew, And by its hallowing might I trust Once more his face to view. And tell our gentle mother, That on her grave I pour The sorrows of my spirit forth, As on her breast of yore. Happy thou art that soon, how soon, Our good and bright will see!— Oh! brother, brother! may I dwell, Erelong, with them and thee! THE TWO HOMES. “Oh! if the soul immortal be, Is not its love immortal too?” See'st thou my home?—'tis where yon woods are waving, In their dark richness, to the summer air, Where yon blue stream, a thousand flower-banks laving, Leads down the hills a vein of light,—'tis there! 'Midst those green wilds how many a fount lies gleaming, Fringed with the violet, colour'd with the skies! My boyhood's haunt, through days of summer dreaming, Under young leaves that shook with melodies. My home! the spirit of its love is breathing In every wind that plays across my track; From its white walls the very tendrils wreathing, Seem with soft links to draw the wanderer back. There am I loved—there pray'd for—there my mother Sits by the hearth with meekly thoughtful eye; There my young sisters watch to greet their brother —Soon their glad footsteps down the path will fly. There, in sweet strains of kindred music blending, All the home-voices meet at day's decline; One are those tones, as from one heart ascending,— There laughs my home—sad stranger! where is thine? Ask'st thou of mine?—In solemn peace 'tis lying, Far o'er the deserts and the tombs away; 'Tis where I, too, am loved with love undying, And fond hearts wait my step—But where are they? Ask where the earth's departed have their dwelling; Ask of the clouds, the stars, the trackless air! I know it not, yet trust the whisper, telling My lonely heart, that love unchanged is there. And what is home, and where, but with the loving? Happy thou art, that so canst gaze on thine! My spirit feels but, in its weary roving, That with the dead, where'er they be, is mine, Go to thy home, rejoicing son and brother! Bear in fresh gladness to the household scene! For me, too, watch the sister and the mother, I well believe—but dark seas roll between. THE SOLDIER'S DEATHBED. “Wie herrlich die Sonne dort untergeht! da ich noch ein Bube war —war's mein Lieblingsgedanke, wie sie zu leben, wie sie zu sterben!” Die Rauber. Like thee to die, thou sun!—My boyhood's dream Was this; and now my spirit, with thy beam, Ebbs from a field of victory!—yet the hour Bears back upon me, with a torrent's power, Nature's deep longings:—Oh! for some kind eye, Wherein to meet love's fervent farewell gaze; Some breast to pillow life's last agony, Some voice, to speak of hope and brighter days, Beyond the pass of shadows!—But I go, I that have been so loved, go hence alone; And ye, now gathering round my own hearth's glow, Sweet friends! it may be that a softer tone, Even in this moment, with your laughing glee, Mingles its cadence while you speak of me: Of me, your soldier, 'midst the mountains lying, On the red banner of his battles dying, Far, far away!—and oh! your parting prayer— Will not his name be fondly murmur'd there? It will!—A blessing on that holy hearth! Though clouds are darkening to o'ercast its mirth. Mother! I may not hear thy voice again; Sisters! ye watch to greet my step in vain; Young brother, fare thee well!—on each dear head Blessing and love a thousandfold be shed, My soul's last earthly breathings!—May your home Smile for you ever!—May no winter come, No world, between your hearts! May ev'n your tears, For my sake, full of long-remember'd years, Quicken the true affections that entwine Your lives in one bright bond!—I may not sleep Amidst our fathers, where those tears might shine Over my slumbers; yet your love will keep My memory living in the ancestral halls, Where shame hath never trod:—the dark night falls, And I depart.—The brave are gone to rest, The brothers of my combats, on the breast Of the red field they reap'd:—their work is done— Thou, too, art set!—farewell, farewell, thou sun! The last lone watcher of the bloody sod, Offers a trusting spirit up to God. THE IMAGE IN THE HEART. TO ? “True, indeed, it is, That they whom death has hidden from our sight, Are worthiest of the mind's regard; with them The future cannot contradict the past— Mortality's last exercise and proof Is undergone.” Wordsworth. “The love where death has set his seal, Nor age can chill, nor rival steal, Nor falsehood disavow.” Byron. I call thee bless'd!—though now the voice be fled, Which, to thy soul, brought dayspring with its tone, And o'er the gentle eyes though dust be spread, Eyes that ne'er look'd on thine but light was thrown Far through thy breast: And though the music of thy life be broken, Or changed in every chord, since he is gone, Feeling all this, even yet, by many a token, O thou, the deeply, but the brightly lone! I call thee bless'd! For in thy heart there is a holy spot, As 'mid the waste an Isle of fount and palm, For ever green!—the world's breath enters not, The passion-tempests may not break its calm; 'Tis thine, all thine! Thither, in trust unbaffled, may'st thou turn From bitter words, cold greetings, heartless eyes, Quenching thy soul's thirst at the hidden urn That fill'd with waters of sweet memory, lies In its own shrine. Thou hast thy home!—there is no power in change To reach that temple of the past; no sway, In all time brings of sudden, dark, or strange, To sweep the still transparent peace away From its hush'd air! And oh! that glorious image of the dead! Sole thing whereon a deathless love may rest, And in deep faith and dreamy worship shed Its high gifts fearlessly!—I call thee bless'd, If only there. Bless'd, for the beautiful within thee dwelling Never to fade!—a refuge from distrust, A spring of purer life, still freshly welling, To clothe the barrenness of earthly dust With flowers divine. And thou hast been beloved!—it is no dream, No false mirage for thee, the fervent love. The rainbow still unreach'd, the ideal gleam, That ever seems before, beyond, above, Far off to shine. But thou, from all the daughters of the earth Singled and mark'd, hast known its home and place; And the high memory of its holy worth, To this our life a glory and a grace For thee hath given. And art thou not still fondly, truly loved? Thou art!—the love his spirit bore away, Was not for death!—a treasure but removed, A bright bird parted for a clearer day,— Thine still in Heaven! THE LAND OF DREAMS. “And dreams, in their development, have breath, And tears and tortures, and the touch of joy; They leave a weight upon our waking thoughts, They make us what we were not—what they will, And shake us with the vision that's gone by.” Byron. O Spirit-Land! thou land of dreams! A world thou art of mysterious gleams, Of startling voices, and sounds at strife, A world of the dead in the hues of life. Like a wizard's magic glass thou art, When the wavy shadows float by, and part: Visions of aspects, now loved, now strange, Glimmering and mingling in ceaseless change. Thou art like a city of the past, With its gorgeous halls into fragments cast, Amidst whose ruins there glide and play Familiar forms of the world's to-day. Thou art like the depths where the seas have birth, Rich with the wealth that is lost from earth,— All the sere flowers of our days gone by, And the buried gems in thy bosom lie. Yes! thou art like those dim sea-caves, A realm of treasures, a realm of graves! And the shapes through thy mysteries that come and go, Are of beauty and terror, of power and woe. But for me, O thou picture-land of sleep! Thou art all one world of affections deep,— And wrung from my heart is each flushing dye, That sweeps o'er thy chambers of imagery. And thy bowers are fair—even as Eden fair: All the beloved of my soul are there! The forms my spirit most pines to see, The eyes, whose love hath been life to me: They are there—and each blessed voice I hear, Kindly, and joyous, and silvery clear; But under-tones are in each, that say,— “It is but a dream; it will melt away!” I walk with sweet friends in the sunset's glow; I listen to music of long ago; But one thought, like an omen, breathes faint through the lay,— “It is but a dream; it will melt away!” I sit by the hearth of my early days; All the home-faces are met by the blaze,— And the eyes of the mother shine soft, yet say, “It is but a dream; it will melt away!” And away, like a flower's passing breath, 'tis gone, And I wake more sadly, more deeply lone! Oh! a haunted heart is a weight to bear,— Bright faces, kind voices! where are ye, where? Shadow not forth, O thou land of dreams, The past, as it fled by my own blue streams! Make not my spirit within me burn For the scenes and the hours that may ne'er return! Call out from the future thy visions bright, From the world o'er the grave, take thy solemn light, And oh! with the loved, whom no more I see, Show me my home, as it yet may be! As it yet may be in some purer sphere, No cloud, no parting, no sleepless fear; So my soul may bear on through the long, long day, Till I go where the beautiful melts not away! WOMAN ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE. “Where hath not woman stood, Strong in affection's might? a reed, upborne By an o'ermastering current!” Gentle and lovely form, What didst thou here, When the fierce battle-storm Bore down the spear? Banner and shiver'd crest, Beside thee strown, Tell, that amidst the best, Thy work was done! Yet strangely, sadly fair, O'er the wild scene, Gleams, through its golden hair, That brow serene. Low lies the stately head,— Earth-bound the free; How gave those haughty dead A place to thee? Slumberer thine early bier Friends should have crown'd, Many a flower and tear Shedding around. Soft voices, clear and young, Mingling their swell, Should o'er thy dust have sung Earth's last farewell. Sisters, above the grave Of thy repose, Should have bid violets wave With the white rose. Now must the trumpet's note, Savage and shrill, For requiem o'er thee float, Thou fair and still! And the swift charger sweep In full career, Trampling thy place of sleep,— Why camest thou here? Why?—ask the true heart why Woman hath been Ever, where brave men die, Unshrinking seen? Unto this harvest ground Proud reapers came,— Some, for that stirring sound, A warrior's name; Some for the stormy play And joy of strife; And some, to fling away A weary life;— But thou, pale sleeper, thou, With the slight frame, And the rich locks, whose glow Death cannot tame; Only one thought, one power, Thee could have led, So, through the tempest's hour, To lift thy head! Only the true, the strong, The love, whose trust Woman's deep soul too long Pours on the dust! THE DESERTED HOUSE. Gloom is upon thy lonely hearth, Oh, silent house! once fill'd with mirth; Sorrow is in the breezy sound Of thy tall poplars whispering round. The shadow of departed hours Hangs dim upon thine early flowers; Even in thy sunshine seems to brood Something more deep than solitude. Fair art thou, fair to a stranger's gaze, Mine own sweet home of other days! My children's birthplace! yet for me, It is too much to look on thee. Too much! for all about thee spread, I feel the memory of the dead, And almost linger for the feet That never more my step shall meet. The looks, the smiles, all vanish'd now, Follow me where thy roses blow; The echoes of kind household-words Are with me 'midst thy singing birds. Till my heart dies, it dies away In yearnings for what might not stay; For love which ne'er deceived my trust, For all which went with “dust to dust!” What now is left me, but to raise From thee, lorn spot! my spirit's gaze, To lift, through tears, my straining eye Up to my Father's house on high? Oh! many are the mansions there, “In my father's house there are many mansions.” John, chap. xiv. But not in one hath grief a share! No haunting shade from things gone by, May there o'ersweep the unchanging sky. And they are there, whose long-loved mien In earthly home no more is seen; Whose places, where they smiling sate, Are left unto us desolate. We miss them when the board is spread; We miss them when the prayer is said; Upon our dreams their dying eyes In still and mournful fondness rise. But they are where these longings vain Trouble no more the heart and brain; The sadness of this aching love Dims not our Father's house above. Ye are at rest, and I in tears, From an ancient Hebrew dirge: “Mourn for the mourner, and not for the dead, For he is at rest, and we in tears!” Ye dwellers of immortal spheres! Under the poplar boughs I stand, And mourn the broken household band. But, by your life of lowly faith, And by your joyful hope in death, Guide me, till on some brighter shore, The sever'd wreath is bound once more! Holy ye were, and good, and true! No change can cloud my thoughts of you; Guide me, like you to live and die, And reach my Father's house on high! THE STRANGER'S HEART. The stranger's heart! Oh! wound it not! A yearning anguish is its lot; In the green shadow of thy tree, The stranger finds no rest with thee. Thou think'st the vine's low rustling leaves Glad music round thy household eaves; To him that sound hath sorrow's tone— The stranger's heart is with his own. Thou think'st thy children's laughing play A lovely sight at fall of day;— Then are the stranger's thoughts oppress'd— His mother's voice comes o'er his breast. Thou think'st it sweet when friend with friend Beneath one roof in prayer may blend; Then doth the stranger's eye grow dim— Far, far are those who pray'd with him. Thy hearth, thy home, thy vintage-land— The voices of thy kindred band— Oh! 'midst them all when bless'd thou art, Deal gently with the stranger's heart! TO A REMEMBERED PICTURE. That of Rizzio, at Holyroodhouse. They haunt me still—those calm, pure, holy eyes! Their piercing sweetness wanders through my dreams: The soul of music that within them lies, Comes o'er my soul in soft and sudden gleams: Life—spirit-life—immortal and divine— Is there—and yet how dark a death was thine! Could it—oh! could it be—meek child of song? The might of gentleness on that fair brow— Was the celestial gift no shield from wrong? Bore it no talisman to ward the blow? Ask if a flower, upon the billows cast, Might brave their strife—a flute-note hush the blast? Are there not deep sad oracles to read In the clear stillness of that radiant face? Yes, even like thee must gifted spirits bleed, Thrown on a world, for heavenly things no place! Bright exiled birds that visit alien skies, Pouring on storms their suppliant melodies. And seeking ever some true, gentle breast, Whereon their trembling plumage might repose, And their free song-notes, from that happy nest, Gush as a fount that forth from sunlight flows; Vain dream! the love whose precious balms might save, Still, still denied—they struggle to the grave. Yet my heart shall not sink!—another doom, Victim! hath set its promise in thine eye; A light is there, too quenchless for the tomb, Bright earnest of a nobler destiny; Telling of answers, in some far-off sphere, To the deep souls that find no echo here. COME HOME! Come home!—there is a sorrowing breath In music since ye went, And the early flower-scents wander by, With mournful memories blent. The tones in every household voice Are grown more sad and deep, And the sweet word—brother—wakes a wish To turn aside and weep. O ye beloved! come home!—the hour Of many a greeting tone, The time of hearth-light and of song Returns—and ye are gone! And darkly, heavily it falls On the forsaken room, Burdening the heart with tenderness, That deepens 'midst the gloom. Where finds it you, ye wandering ones? With all your boyhood's glee Untamed, beneath the desert's palm, Or on the lone mid-sea? By stormy hills of battles old? Or where dark rivers foam?— Oh! life is dim where ye are not— Back, ye beloved, come home! Come with the leaves and winds of spring, And swift birds, o'er the main! Our love is grown too sorrowful— Bring us its youth again! Bring the glad tones to music back! Still, still your home is fair, The spirit of your sunny life Alone is wanting there! THE FOUNTAIN OF OBLIVION. “Implora pace!” Quoted from a letter of Lord Byron's. He describes the impression produced upon him by some tombs at Bologna, bearing this simple inscription, and adds, “When I die, I could wish that some friend would see these words, and no other, placed above my grave,—“Implora pace.’” One draught, kind fairy! from that fountain deep, To lay the phantoms of a haunted breast, And lone affections, which are griefs, to steep In the cool honey-dews of dreamless rest; And from the soul the lightning-marks to lave— One draught of that sweet wave! Yet, mortal, pause!—within thy mind is laid Wealth, gather'd long and slowly; thoughts divine Heap that full treasure-house; and thou hast made The gems of many a spirit's ocean thine;— Shall the dark waters to oblivion bear A pyramid so fair? Pour from the fount! and let the draught efface All the vain lore by memory's pride amass'd, So it but sweep along the torrent's trace, And fill the hollow channels of the past; And from the bosom's inmost folded leaf, Rase the one master-grief! Yet pause once more!—all, all thy soul hath known, Loved, felt, rejoiced in, from its grasp must fade! Is there no voice whose kind awakening tone A sense of spring-time in thy heart hath made? No eye whose glance thy daydreams would recall? —Think—would'st thou part with all? Fill with forgetfulness!—there are, there are Voices whose music I have loved too well; Eyes of deep gentleness—but they are far— Never! oh—never, in my home to dwell! Take their soft looks from off my yearning soul— Fill high th' oblivious bowl! Yet pause again!—with memory wilt thou cast The undying hope away, of memory born? Hope of reunion, heart to heart at last, No restless doubt between, no rankling thorn? Would'st thou erase all records of delight That make such visions bright? Fill with forgetfulness, fill high!—yet stay— 'Tis from the past we shadow forth the land Where smiles, long lost, again shall light our way, And the soul's friends be wreath'd in one bright band: —Pour the sweet waters back on their own rill, I must remember still. For their sake, for the dead—whose image nought May dim within the temple of my breast— For their love's sake, which now no earthly thought May shake or trouble with its own unrest, Though the past haunt me as a spirit—yet I ask not to forget. MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. THE BRIDAL DAY. On a monument in a Venetian church is an epitaph, recording that the remains beneath are those of a noble lady, who expired suddenly while standing as a bride at the altar. “We bear her home! we bear her home! Over the murmuring salt sea's foam: One who has fled from the war of life, From sorrow, pain, and the fever strife.” Barry Cornwall. Bride! upon thy marriage-day When thy gems in rich array Made the glistening mirror seem As a star-reflecting stream; When the clustering pearls lay fair 'Midst thy braids of sunny hair, And the white veil o'er thee streaming, Like a silvery halo gleaming, Mellow'd all that pomp and light Into something meekly bright; Did the fluttering of thy breath Speak of joy or woe beneath? And the hue that went and came O'er thy cheek, like wavering flame, Flow'd that crimson from the unrest, Or the gladness of thy breast? —Who shall tell us? from thy bower, Brightly didst thou pass that hour; With the many-glancing oar, And the cheer along the shore, And the wealth of summer flowers On thy fair head cast in showers, And the breath of song and flute, And the clarion's glad salute, Swiftly o'er the Adrian tide Wert thou borne in pomp, young bride! Mirth and music, sun and sky, Welcomed thee triumphantly! Yet, perchance, a chastening thought, In some deeper spirit wrought, Whispering, as untold it blent With the sounds of merriment, “From the home of childhood's glee, From the days of laughter free, From the love of many years, Thou art gone to cares and fears; To another path and guide, To a bosom yet untried! Bright one! oh! there well may be Trembling 'midst our joy for thee.” Bride! when through the stately fane, Circled with thy nuptial train, 'Midst the banners hung on high By thy warrior-ancestry, 'Midst those mighty fathers dead, In soft beauty thou wast led; When before the shrine thy form Quiver'd to some bosom storm, When, like harp-strings with a sigh Breaking in mid-harmony, On thy lip the murmurs low Died with love's unfinish'd vow; When like scatter'd rose-leaves, fled From thy cheek each tint of red, And the light forsook thine eye, And thy head sank heavily; Was that drooping but the excess Of thy spirit's blessedness? Or did some deep feeling's might, Folded in thy heart from sight, With a sudden tempest-shower, Earthward bear thy life's young flower? —Who shall tell us?—on thy tongue Silence, and for ever, hung! Never to thy lip and cheek Rush'd again the crimson streak, Never to thine eye return'd That which there had beam'd and burn'd! With the secret none might know, With thy rapture or thy woe, With thy marriage-robe and wreath, Thou wert fled, young bride of death! One, one lightning moment there Struck down triumph to despair, Beauty, splendour, hope, and trust, Into darkness—terror—dust! There were sounds of weeping o'er thee, Bride! as forth thy kindred bore thee, Shrouded in thy gleaming veil, Deaf to that wild funeral wail, Yet perchance a chastening thought, In some deeper spirit wrought, Whispering while the stern, sad knell On the air's bright stillness fell; —“From the power of chill and change Souls to sever and estrange; From love's wane—a death in life But to watch—a mortal strife; From the secret fevers known To the burning heart alone, Thou art fled—afar, away— Where these blights no more have sway! Bright one! oh! there well may be Comfort 'midst our tears for thee!” THE ANCESTRAL SONG. “A long war disturb'd your mind— Here your perfect peace is sign'd; 'Tis now full tide 'twixt night and day, End your moan, and come away!” Webster—Duchess of Malfy. There were faint sounds of weeping;—fear and gloom And midnight vigil in a stately room Of Lusignan's old halls:—rich odours there Fill'd the proud chamber as with Indian air, And soft light fell, from lamps of silver, thrown On jewels that with rainbow lustre shone Over a gorgeous couch:—there emeralds gleam'd, And deeper crimson from the ruby stream'd Than in the heart-leaf of the rose is set, Hiding from sunshine.—Many a carcanet Starry with diamonds, many a burning chain Of the red gold, sent forth a radiance vain, And sad, and strange, the canopy beneath Whose shadowy curtains, round a bed of death, Hung drooping solemnly;—for there one lay, Passing from all earth's glories fast away, Amidst those queenly treasures: They had been Gifts of her lord, from far-off Paynim lands, And for his sake, upon their orient sheen She had gazed fondly, and with faint, cold hands Had press'd them to her languid heart once more, Melting in childlike tears. But this was o'er— Love's last vain clinging unto life; and now— A mist of dreams was hovering o'er her brow, Her eye was fix'd, her spirit seem'd removed, Though not from earth, from all it knew or loved, Far, far away! her handmaids watch'd around, In awe, that lent to each low midnight sound A might, a mystery; and the quivering light Of wind-sway'd lamps, made spectral in their sight The forms of buried beauty, sad, yet fair, Gleaming along the walls with braided hair, Long in the dust grown dim; and she, too, saw, But with the spirit's eye of raptured awe, Those pictured shapes!—a bright, yet solemn train Beckoning, they floated o'er her dreamy brain, Clothed in diviner hues; while on her ear Strange voices fell, which none besides might hear, Sweet, yet profoundly mournful, as the sigh Of winds o'er harp-strings through a midnight sky; And thus it seem'd, in that low thrilling tone, Th' ancestral shadows call'd away their own. Come, come, come! Long thy fainting soul hath yearn'd For the step that ne'er return'd; Long thine anxious ear hath listen'd, And thy watchful eye hath glisten'd With the hope, whose parting strife Shook the flower-leaves from thy life— Now the heavy day is done, Home awaits thee, wearied one! Come, come, come! From the quenchless thoughts that burn In the seal'd heart's lonely urn; From the coil of memory's chain Wound about the throbbing brain; From the veins of sorrow deep, Winding through the world of sleep; From the haunted halls and bowers, Throng'd with ghosts of happier hours! Come, come, come! On our dim and distant shore Aching love is felt no more! We have loved with earth's excess— Past is now that weariness! We have wept, that weep not now— Calm is each once-beating brow! We have known the dreamer's woes— All is now one bright repose! Come, come, come! Weary heart that long hast bled, Languid spirit, drooping head, Restless memory, vain regret, Pining love whose light is set, Come away!—'tis hush'd, 'tis well, Where by shadowy founts we dwell, All the fever thirst is still'd, All the air with peace is fill'd,— Come, come, come! And with her spirit rapt in that wild lay, She pass'd, as twilight melts to night, away! THE MAGIC GLASS. “How lived, how loved, how died they? Byron. “The dead! the glorious dead!—And shall they rise? Shall they look on thee with their proud bright eyes? Thou ask'st a fearful spell! Yet say, from shrine or dim sepulchral hall, What kingly vision shall obey my call? The deep grave knows it well! “Would'st thou behold earth's conquerors? shall they pass Before thee, flushing all the Magic Glass With triumph's long array? Speak! and those dwellers of the marble urn, Robed for the feast of victory, shall return, As on their proudest day. “Or would'st thou look upon the lords of song?— O'er the dark mirror that immortal throng Shall waft a solemn gleam! Passing, with lighted eyes and radiant brows, Under the foliage of green laurel-boughs, But silent as a dream.” “Not these, O mighty master!—Though their lays Be unto man's free heart, and tears, and praise, Hallow'd for evermore! And not the buried conquerors! Let them sleep, And let the flowery earth her Sabbaths keep In joy, from shore to shore! “But, if the narrow house may so be moved, Call the bright shadows of the most beloved, Back from their couch of rest! That I may learn if their meek eyes be fill'd With peace, if human love hath ever still'd The yearning human breast.” “Away, fond youth!—An idle quest is thine; These have no trophy, no memorial shrine; I know not of their place! 'Midst the dim valleys, with a secret flow, Their lives, like shepherd reed-notes, faint and low, Have pass'd, and left no trace. “Haply, begirt with shadowy woods and hills, And the wild sounds of melancholy rills, Their covering turf may bloom; But ne'er hath fame made relics of its flowers— Never hath pilgrim sought their household bowers, Or poet hail'd their tomb.” “Adieu, then, master of the midnight spell! Some voice, perchance, by those lone graves may tell That which I pine to know! I haste to seek, from woods and valleys deep, Where the beloved are laid in lowly sleep, Records of joy and woe.” CORINNE AT THE CAPITOL. “Les femmes doivent penser qu'il est dans cette carrière bien peu de sorte qui puissent valoir la plus obscure vie d'une femme aimée et d'une mère heureuse.” Madame de Staël. Daughter of th' Italian heaven! Thou, to whom its fires are given, Joyously thy car hath roll'd Where the conqueror's pass'd of old; And the festal sun that shone, O'er three hundred triumphs gone, The trebly hundred triumphs.—Byron. Makes thy day of glory bright, With a shower of golden light. Now thou tread'st th' ascending road, Freedom's foot so proudly trode; While, from tombs of heroes borne, From the dust of empire shorn, Flowers upon thy graceful head, Chaplets of all hues, are shed, In a soft and rosy rain, Touch'd with many a gem-like stain. Thou hast gain'd the summit now! Music hails thee from below; Music, whose rich notes might stir Ashes of the sepulchre; Shaking with victorious notes All the bright air as it floats. Well may woman's heart beat high Unto that proud harmony! Now afar it rolls—it dies— And thy voice is heard to rise With a low and lovely tone In its thrilling power alone; And thy lyre's deep silvery string, Touch'd as by a breeze's wing, Murmurs tremblingly at first, Ere the tide of rapture burst. All the spirit of thy sky Now hath lit thy large dark eye, And thy cheek a flush hath caught From the joy of kindled thought; And the burning words of song From thy lip flow fast and strong, With a rushing stream's delight In the freedom of its might. Radiant daughter of the sun! Now thy living wreath is won. Crown'd of Rome!—Oh! art thou not Happy in that glorious lot?— Happier, happier far than thou, With the laurel on thy brow, She that makes the humblest hearth Lovely but to one on earth! THE RUIN. “Oh! tis the heart that magnifies this life, Making a truth and beauty of its own.” Wordsworth. “Birth has gladden'd it: death has sanctified it.” Guesses at Truth. No dower of storied song is thine, O desolate abode! Forth from thy gates no glittering line Of lance and spear hath flow'd. Banners of knighthood have not flung Proud drapery o'er thy walls, Nor bugle-notes to battle rung Through thy resounding halls. Nor have rich bowers of pleasaunce here By courtly hands been dress'd, For princes, from the chase of deer, Under green leaves to rest: Only some rose, yet lingering bright Beside thy casements lone, Tells where the spirit of delight Hath dwelt, and now is gone. Yet minstrel tale of harp and sword, And sovereign beauty's lot, House of quench'd light and silent board! For me thou needest not. It is enough to know that here, Where thoughtfully I stand, Sorrow and love, and hope and fear, Have link'd one kindred band. Thou bindest me with mighty spells! —A solemnizing breath, A presence all around thee dwells, Of human life and death. I need but pluck yon garden flower From where the wild weeds rise, To wake, with strange and sudden power, A thousand sympathies. Thou hast heard many sounds, thou hearth! Deserted now by all! Voices at eve here met in mirth Which eve may ne'er recall. Youth's buoyant step, and woman's tone, And childhood's laughing glee, And song and prayer, have all been known, Hearth of the dead! to thee. Thou hast heard blessings fondly pour'd Upon the infant head, As if in every fervent word The living soul were shed; Thou hast seen partings, such as bear The bloom from life away— Alas! for love in changeful air, Where nought beloved can stay! Here, by the restless bed of pain, The vigil hath been kept, Till sunrise, bright with hope in vain, Burst forth on eyes that wept: Here hath been felt the hush, the gloom, The breathless influence, shed Through the dim dwelling, from the room Wherein reposed the dead. The seat left void, the missing face, Have here been mark'd and mourn'd, And time hath fill'd the vacant place, And gladness hath return'd; Till from the narrowing household chain The links dropp'd one by one! And homewards hither, o'er the main, Came the spring-birds alone. Is there not cause, then—cause for thought, Fix'd eye and lingering tread, Where, with their thousand mysteries fraught, Even lowliest hearts have bled? Where, in its ever-haunting thirst For draughts of purer day, Man's soul, with fitful strength, hath burst The clouds that wrapt its way? Holy to human nature seems The long-forsaken spot; To deep affections, tender dreams, Hopes of a brighter lot! Therefore in silent reverence here, Hearth of the dead! I stand, Where joy and sorrow, smile and tear, Have link'd one household band. THE MINSTER. “A fit abode, wherein appear enshrined Our hopes of immortality.” Byron. Speak low!—the place is holy to the breath Of awful harmonies, of whisper'd prayer; Tread lightly!—for the sanctity of death Broods with a voiceless influence on the air: Stern, yet serene!—a reconciling spell, Each troubled billow of the soul to quell. Leave me to linger silently awhile! —Not for the light that pours its fervid streams Of rainbow glory down through arch and aisle, Kindling old banners into haughty gleams, Flushing proud shrines, or by some warrior's tomb Dying away in clouds of gorgeous gloom: Not for rich music, though in triumph pealing, Mighty as forest sounds when winds are high; Nor yet for torch, and cross, and stole, revealing Through incense-mists their sainted pageantry:— Though o'er the spirit each hath charm and power, Yet not for these I ask one lingering hour. But by strong sympathies, whose silver cord Links me to mortal weal, my soul is bound; Thoughts of the human hearts, that here have pour'd Their anguish forth, are with me and around;— I look back on the pangs, the burning tears, Known to these altars of a thousand years. Send up a murmur from the dust, Remorse! That here hast bow'd with ashes on thy head: And thou, still battling with the tempest's force— Thou, whose bright spirit through all time has bled— Speak, wounded Love! if penance here, or prayer, Hath laid one haunting shadow of despair? No voice, no breath!—of conflicts past, no trace! —Doth not this hush give answer to my quest? Surely the dread religion of the place By every grief hath made its might confest! —Oh! that within my heart I could but keep Holy to Heaven, a spot thus pure, and still, and deep! THE SONG OF NIGHT. Suggested by Thorwaldsen's bas-relief of Night, represented under the form of a winged female figure, with two infants asleep in her arms. “O night, And storm, and darkness! ye are wondrous strong, Yet lovely in your strength!” Byron. I come to thee, O Earth! With all my gifts!—for every flower sweet dew In bell, and urn, and chalice, to renew The glory of its birth. Not one which glimmering lies Far amidst folding hills, or forest leaves, But, through its veins of beauty, so receives A spirit of fresh dyes. I come with every star; Making thy streams, that on their noon-day track, Give but the moss, the reed, the lily back, Mirrors of worlds afar. I come with peace:—I shed Sleep through thy wood-walks, o'er the honey-bee, The lark's triumphant voice, the fawn's young glee, The hyacinth's meek head. On my own heart I lay The weary babe; and sealing with a breath Its eyes of love, send fairy dreams, beneath The shadowing lids to play. I come with mightier things! Who calls me silent? I have many tones— The dark skies thrill with low mysterious moans, Borne on my sweeping wings. I waft them not alone From the deep organ of the forest shades, Or buried streams, unheard amidst their glades, Till the bright day is done; But in the human breast A thousand still small voices I awake, Strong, in their sweetness, from the soul to shake The mantle of its rest. I bring them from the past: From true hearts broken, gentle spirits torn, From crush'd affections, which, though long o'erborne, Make their tones heard at last. I bring them from the tomb: O'er the sad couch of late repentant love They pass—though low as murmurs of a dove— Like trumpets through the gloom. I come with all my train; Who calls me lonely?—Hosts around me tread, The intensely bright, the beautiful, the dead— Phantoms of heart and brain! Looks from departed eyes— These are my lightnings!—fill'd with anguish vain, Or tenderness too piercing to sustain, They smite with agonies. I, that with soft control, Shut the dim violet, hush the woodland song, I am the avenging one!—the arm'd, the strong— The searcher of the soul! I, that shower dewy light Through slumbering leaves, bring storms!—the tempest-birth Of memory, thought, remorse:—Be holy, Earth! I am the solemn Night! THE STORM-PAINTER IN HIS DUNGEON. Pietro Mulier, called Il Tempesta, from his surprising pictures of storms. “His compositions,” says Lanzi, “inspire a real horror, presenting to our eyes death-devoted ships overtaken by tempests and darkness—fired by lightning—now rising on the mountain-wave, and again submerged in the abyss of ocean.” During an imprisonment of five years in Genoa, the pictures which he painted in his dungeon were marked by additional power and gloom.—See Lanzi's History of Painting, translated by Roscoe. “Where of ye, O tempests, is the goal? Are ye like those that shake the human breast? Or do ye find at length, like eagles, some high nest?” Childe Harold. Midnight, and silence deep! —The air is fill'd with sleep, With the stream's whisper, and the citron's breath; The fix'd and solemn stars Gleam through my dungeon bars— Wake, rushing winds! this breezeless calm is death! Ye watch-fires of the skies! The stillness of your eyes Looks too intensely through my troubled soul; I feel this weight of rest An earth-load on my breast— Wake, rushing winds, awake! and, dark clouds, roll! I am your own, your child, O ye, the fierce, and wild, And kingly tempests!—will ye not arise? Hear the bold spirit's voice, That knows not to rejoice But in the peal of your strong harmonies. By sounding ocean-waves, And dim Calabrian caves, And flashing torrents, I have been your mate; And with the rocking pines Of the olden Apennines, In your dark path stood fearless and elate: Your lightnings were as rods, That smote the deep abodes Of thought and vision—and the stream gush'd free; Come, that my soul again May swell to burst its chain— Bring me the music of the sweeping sea! Within me dwells a flame, An eagle caged and tame, Till call'd forth by the harping of the blast; Then is its triumph's hour, It springs to sudden power, As mounts the billow o'er the quivering mast. Then, then, the canvass o'er, With hurried hand I pour The lava-waves and gusts of my own soul! Kindling to fiery life Dreams, worlds, of pictured strife— Wake, rushing winds, awake! and, dark clouds, roll! Wake, rise! the reed may bend, The shivering leaf descend, The forest branch give way before your might; But I, your strong compeer, Call, summon, wait you here— Answer, my spirit!—answer, storm and night! THE TWO VOICES. Two solemn Voices, in a funeral strain, Met as rich sunbeams and dark bursts of rain Meet in the sky: “Thou art gone hence!” one sang; “Our light is flown, Our beautiful, that seem'd too much our own Ever to die! “Thou art gone hence!—our joyous hills among Never again to pour thy soul in song, When spring-flowers rise! Never the friend's familiar step to meet With loving laughter, and the welcome sweet Of thy glad eyes.” “Thou art gone home, gone home!” then, high and clear, Warbled that other Voice: “Thou hast no tear Again to shed. Never to fold the robe o'er secret pain, Never, weigh'd down by Memory's clouds, again To bow thy head. “Thou art gone home! oh! early crown'd and blest! Where could the love of that deep heart find rest With aught below? Thou must have seen rich dream by dream decay, All the bright rose-leaves drop from life away— Thrice bless'd to go!” Yet sigh'd again that breeze-like Voice of grief— “Thou art gone hence! alas! that aught so brief, So loved should be; Thou tak'st our summer hence!—the flower, the tone The music of our being, all in one, Depart with thee! “Fair form, young spirit, morning vision fled! Canst thou be of the dead, the awful dead? The dark unknown? Yes! to the dwelling where no footsteps fall, Never again to light up hearth or hall, Thy smile is gone!” “Home, home!” once more the exulting Voice arose: “Thou art gone home!—from that divine repose Never to roam! Never to say farewell, to weep in vain, To read of change, in eyes beloved, again— Thou art gone home! ‘By the bright waters now thy lot is cast— Joy for thee, happy friend! thy bark hath past The rough sea's foam! Now the long yearnings of thy soul are still'd, Home! home!—thy peace is won, thy heart is fill'd. Thou art gone home!” THE PARTING SHIP. “A glittering ship, that hath the plain Of ocean for her own domain.” Wordsworth. Go, in thy glory, o'er the ancient sea, Take with thee gentle winds thy sails to swell; Sunshine and joy upon thy streamers be, Fare-thee-well, bark! farewell! Proudly the flashing billow thou hast cleft, The breeze yet follows thee with cheer and song; Who now of storms hath dream or memory left? And yet the deep is strong! But go thou triumphing, while still the smiles Of summer tremble on the water's breast! Thou shalt be greeted by a thousand isles, In lone, wild beauty drest. To thee a welcome breathing o'er the tide, The genii groves of Araby shall pour; Waves that enfold the pearl shall bathe thy side, On the old Indian shore. Oft shall the shadow of the palm-tree lie O'er glassy bays wherein thy sails are furl'd, And its leaves whisper, as the wind sweeps by, Tales of the elder world. Oft shall the burning stars of Southern skies, On the mid-ocean see thee chain'd in sleep, A lonely home for human thoughts and ties, Between the heavens and deep. Blue seas that roll on gorgeous coasts renown'd, By night shall sparkle where thy prow makes way; Strange creatures of the abyss that none may sound, In thy broad wake shall play. From hills unknown, in mingled joy and fear, Free dusky tribes shall pour, thy flag to mark;— Blessings go with thee on thy lone career! Hail, and farewell, thou bark! A long farewell!—Thou wilt not bring us back All whom thou bearest far from home and hearth: Many are thine, whose steps no more shall track Their own sweet native earth! Some wilt thou leave beneath the plantain's shade, Where through the foliage Indian suns look bright; Some in the snows of wintry regions laid, By the cold northern light. And some, far down below the sounding wave, Still shall they lie, though tempests o'er them sweep; Never may flower be strewn above their grave, Never may sister weep! And thou—the billow's queen—even thy proud form On our glad sight no more perchance may swell; Yet God alike is in the calm and storm— Fare-thee-well, bark! farewell! THE LAST TREE OF THE FOREST. Whisper, thou Tree, thou lonely Tree, One, where a thousand stood! Well might proud tales be told by thee, Last of the solemn wood! Dwells there no voice amidst thy boughs, With leaves yet darkly green? Stillness is round, and noontide glows— Tell us what thou hast seen. “I have seen the forest shadows lie Where men now reap the corn; I have seen the kingly chase rush by, Through the deep glades at morn. “With the glance of many a gallant spear, And the wave of many a plume, And the bounding of a hundred deer, It hath lit the woodland's gloom. “I have seen the knight and his train ride past, With his banner borne on high; O'er all my leaves there was brightness cast From his gleaming panoply. “The pilgrim at my feet hath laid His palm branch 'midst the flowers, And told his beads, and meekly pray'd, Kneeling, at vesper-hours. “And the merry-men of wild and glen, In the green array they wore, Have feasted here, with the red wine's cheer, And the hunter's song of yore. “And the minstrel, resting in my shade, Hath made the forest ring With the lordly tales of the high Crusade, Once loved by chief and king. “But now the noble forms are gone That walk'd the earth of old; The soft wind hath a mournful tone, The sunny light looks cold. “There is no glory left us now, Like the glory with the dead:— I would that where they slumber low My latest leaves were shed!” Oh! thou dark Tree, thou lonely Tree, That mournest for the past! A peasant's home in thy shades I see, Embower'd from every blast. A lovely and a mirthful sound Of laughter meets mine ear; For the poor man's children sport around On the turf, with nought to fear. And roses lend that cabin's wall A happy summer-glow: And the open door stands free to all, For it recks not of a foe. And the village bells are on the breeze That stirs thy leaf, dark Tree! How can I mourn, 'midst things like these, For the stormy past, with thee? THE STREAMS. “The power, the beauty, and the majesty, That had their haunts in dale or piny mountain, Or forest by slow stream, or pebbly spring, Or chasms and watery depths; all those have vanish'd! They live no longer in the faith of heaven, But still the heart doth need a language!” Coleridge's Wallenstein. Ye have been holy, O founts and floods! Ye of the ancient and solemn woods, Ye that are born of the valleys deep, With the water-flowers on your breast asleep, And ye that gush from the sounding caves— Hallow'd have been your waves. Hallow'd by man, in his dreams of old, Unto beings not of this mortal mould Viewless, and deathless, and wondrous powers, Whose voice he heard in his lonely hours, And sought with its fancied sound to still The heart earth could not fill. Therefore the flowers of bright summers gone, O'er your sweet waters, ye streams! were thrown; Thousand of gifts to the sunny sea Have ye swept along, in your wanderings free, And thrill'd to the murmur of many a vow— Where all is silent now! Nor seems it strange that the heart hath been So link'd in love to your margins green; That still, though ruin'd, your early shrines In beauty gleam through the southern vines, And the ivied chapels of colder skies, On your wild banks arise. For the loveliest scenes of the glowing earth, Are those, bright streams! where your springs have birth; Whether their cavern'd murmur fills, With a tone of plaint, the hollow hills, Or the glad sweet laugh of their healthful flow Is heard 'midst the hamlets low. Or whether, ye gladden the desert sands With a joyous music to pilgrim bands, And a flash from under some ancient rock, Where a shepherd-king might have watch'd his flock, Where a few lone palm-trees lift their heads, And a green Acacia spreads. Or whether, in bright old lands renown'd, The laurels thrill to your first-born sound, And the shadow, flung from the Grecian pine, Sweeps with the breeze o'er your gleaming line, And the tall reeds whisper to your waves, Beside heroic graves. Voices and lights of the lonely place! By the freshest fern your path we trace; By the brightest cups on the emerald moss, Whose fairy goblets the turf emboss, By the rainbow glancing of insect wings, In a thousand mazy rings. There sucks the bee, for the richest flowers Are all your own through the summer hours; There the proud stag his fair image knows, Traced on your glass beneath alder-boughs, And the Halcyon's breast, like the skies arrray'd, Gleams through the willow-shade. But the wild sweet tales, that with elves and fays Peopled your banks in the olden days, And the memory left by departed love, To your antique founts in glen and grove, And the glory born of the poet's dreams— These are your charms, bright streams! Now is the time of your flowery rites, Gone by with its dances and young delights: From your marble urns ye have burst away, From your chapel-cells to the laughing day; Low lie your altars with moss o'ergrown, And the woods again are lone. Yet holy still be your living springs, Haunts of all gentle and gladsome things! Holy, to converse with nature's lore, That gives the worn spirit its youth once more, And to silent thoughts of the love divine, Making the heart a shrine! THE VOICE OF THE WIND. “There is nothing in the wide world so like the voice of a spirit.” Gray's Letters. Oh! many a voice is thine, thou Wind! full many a voice is thine, From every scene thy wing o'ersweeps thou bear'st a sound and sign; A minstrel wild and strong thou art, with a mastery all thine own, And the spirit is thy harp, O Wind! that gives the answering tone. Thou hast been across red fields of war, where shiver'd helmets lie, And thou bringest thence the thrilling note of a clarion in the sky; A rustling of proud banner-folds, a peal of stormy drums,— All these are in thy music met, as when a leader comes. Thou hast been o'er solitary seas, and from their wastes brought back Each noise of waters that awoke in the mystery of thy track— The chime of low soft southern waves on some green palmy shore, The hollow roll of distant surge, the gather'd billows' roar. Thou art come from forests dark and deep, thou mighty rushing Wind! And thou bearest all their unisons in one full swell combined; The restless pines, the moaning stream, all hidden things and free, Of the dim old sounding wilderness, have lent their soul to thee. Thou art come from cities lighted up for the conqueror passing by, Thou art wafting from their streets a sound of haughty revelry; The rolling of triumphant wheels, the harpings in the hall, The far-off shout of multitudes, are in thy rise and fall. Thou art come from kingly tombs and shrines, from ancient minsters vast, Through the dark aisles of a thousand years thy lonely wing hath pass'd; Thou hast caught the anthem's billowy swell, the stately dirge's tone, For a chief, with sword, and shield, and helm, to his place of slumber gone. Thou art come from long-forsaken homes, wherein our young days flew, Thou hast found sweet voices lingering there, the loved, the kind, the true; Thou callest back those melodies, though now all changed and fled— Be still, be still, and haunt us not with music from the dead! Are all these notes in thee, wild wind? these many notes in thee? Far in our own unfathom'd souls their fount must surely be; Yes! buried, but unsleeping, there thought watches, memory lies, From whose deep urn the tones are pour'd through all earth's harmonies. THE VIGIL OF ARMS. The candidate for knighthood was under the necessity of keeping watch, the night before his inauguration, in a church, and completely armed. This was called “the Vigil of Arms.” A sounding step was heard by night In a church where the mighty slept, As a mail-clad youth, till morning's light, 'Midst the tombs his vigil kept. He walk'd in dreams of power and fame, He lifted a proud, bright eye, For the hours were few that withheld his name From the roll of chivalry. Down the moonlit aisles he paced alone, With a free and stately tread; And the floor gave back a muffled tone From the couches of the dead: The silent many that round him lay, The crown'd and helm'd that were, The haughty chiefs of the war array— Each in his sepulchre! But no dim warning of time or fate That youth's flush'd hopes could chill; He moved through the trophies of buried state With each proud pulse throbbing still. He heard, as the wind through the chancel sung, A swell of the trumpet's breath; He look'd to the banners on high that hung, And not to the dust beneath. And a royal masque of splendour seem'd Before him to unfold; Through the solemn arches on it stream'd, With many a gleam of gold: There were crested knight, and gorgeous dame, Glittering athwart the gloom, And he follow'd, till his bold step came To his warrior-father's tomb. But there the still and shadowy might Of the monumental stone, And the holy sleep of the soft lamp's light That over its quiet shone, And the image of that sire, who died In his noonday of renown— These had a power unto which the pride Of fiery life bow'd down. And a spirit from his early years Came back o'er his thoughts to move, Till his eye was fill'd with memory's tears, And his heart with childhood's love! And he look'd, with a change in his softening glance, To the armour o'er the grave— For there they hung, the shield and lance, And the gauntlet of the brave. And the sword of many a field was there, With its cross for the hour of need, When the knight's bold war-cry hath sunk in prayer, And the spear is a broken reed! —Hush! did a breeze through the armour sigh? Did the folds of the banner shake? Not so!—from the tomb's dark mystery There seem'd a voice to break! He had heard that voice bid clarions blow, He had caught its last blessing's breath— 'Twas the same—but its awful sweetness now Had an under-tone of death! And it said—“The sword hath conquer'd kings, And the spear through realms hath pass'd; But the cross, alone, of all these things, Might aid me at the last.” THE HEART OF BRUCE IN MELROSE ABBEY. Heart! that did'st press forward still, “Now pass thou forward, as thou wert wont, and Douglas will follow thee or die!” With these words Douglas threw from him the heart of Bruce into mid-battle against the Moors of Spain. Where the trumpet's note rang shrill, Where the knightly swords were crossing, And the plumes like sea-foam tossing, Leader of the charging spear, Fiery heart!—and liest thou here? May this narrow spot inurn Aught that so could beat and burn? Heart! that lovedst the clarion's blast, Silent is thy place at last; Silent—save when early bird Sings where once the mass was heard; Silent—save when breeze's moan Comes through flowers or fretted stone; And the wild-rose waves around thee, And the long dark grass hath bound thee, —Sleep'st thou, as the swain might sleep, In his nameless valley deep? No! brave heart! though cold and lone, Kingly power is yet thine own! Feel I not thy spirit brood O'er the whispering solitude? Lo! at one high thought of thee, Fast they rise, the bold, the free, Sweeping past thy lowly bed, With a mute, yet stately tread. Shedding their pale armour's light Forth upon the breathless night, Bending every warlike plume In the prayer o'er saintly tomb. Is the noble Douglas nigh, Arm'd to follow thee, or die? Now, true heart, as thou wert wont Pass thou to the peril's front! Where the banner-spear is gleaming, And the battle's red wine streaming, Till the Paynim quail before thee, Till the cross wave proudly o'er thee— Dreams! the falling of a leaf Wins me from their splendours brief; Dreams, yet bright ones! scorn them not, Thou that seek'st the holy spot; Nor, amidst its lone domain, Call the faith in relics vain! NATURE'S FAREWELL. “The beautiful is vanish'd, and returns not.” Coleridge's Wallenstein. A youth rode forth from his childhood's home, Through the crowded paths of the world to roam; And the green leaves whisper'd, as he pass'd, “Wherefore, thou dreamer, away so fast? “Knew'st thou with what thou art parting here, Long would'st thou linger in doubt and fear; Thy heart's light laughter, thy sunny hours, Thou hast left in our shades with the spring's wild flowers. “Under the arch by our mingling made, Thou and thy brother have gaily play'd; Ye may meet again where ye roved of yore, But as ye have met there—oh! never more!” On rode the youth—and the boughs among, Thus the free birds o'er his pathway sung: “Wherefore so fast unto life away? Thou art leaving for ever thy joy in our lay! “Thou may'st come to the summer woods again, And thy heart have no echo to greet their strain; Afar from the foliage its love will dwell— A change must pass o'er thee-farewell, farewell!” On rode the youth—and the founts and streams Thus mingled a voice with his joyous dreams: “We have been thy playmates through many a day, Wherefore thus leave us?—oh! yet delay! “Listen but once to the sound of our mirth! For thee 'tis a melody passing from earth. Never again wilt thou find in its flow, The peace it could once on thy heart bestow. “Thou wilt visit the scenes of thy childhood's glee, With the breath of the world on thy spirit free; Passion and sorrow its depth will have stirr'd, And the singing of waters be vainly heard. “Thou wilt bear in our gladsome laugh no part— What should it do for a burning heart? Thou wilt bring to the banks of our freshest rill, Thirst which no fountain on earth may still. “Farewell!—when thou comest again to thine own, Thou wilt miss from our music its loveliest tone; Mournfully true is the tale we tell— Yet on, fiery dreamer! farewell, farewell!” And a something of gloom on his spirit weigh'd As he caught the last sounds of his native shade; But he knew not, till many a bright spell broke, How deep were the oracles Nature spoke! THE BEINGS OF THE MIND. “The beings of the mind are not of clay; Essentially immortal, they create And multiply in us a brighter ray, And more beloved existence; that which Fate Prohibits to dull life, in this our state Of mortal bondage.” Byron. Come to me with your triumphs and your woes, Ye forms, to life by glorious poets brought! I sit alone with flowers, and vernal boughs, In the deep shadow of a voiceless thought; 'Midst the glad music of the spring alone, And sorrowful for visions that are gone! Come to me! make your thrilling whispers heard, Ye, by those masters of the soul endow'd With life, and love, and many a burning word, That bursts from grief, like lightning from a cloud, And smites the heart, till all its chords reply, As leaves make answer when the wind sweeps by. Come to me! visit my dim haunt!—the sound Of hidden springs is in the grass beneath; The stock-dove's note above; and all around, The poesy that with the violet's breath Floats through the air, in rich and sudden streams, Mingling, like music, with the soul's deep dreams. Friends, friends!—for such to my lone heart ye are— Unchanging ones! from whose immortal eyes The glory melts not as a waning star, And the sweet kindness never, never dies; Bright children of the bard! o'er this green dell Pass once again, and light it with your spell! Imogen! fair Fidele! meekly blending In patient grief, “a smiling with a sigh;” A smiling with a sigh.”Cymbeline. And thou, Cordelia! faithful daughter, tending That sire, an outcast to the bitter sky; Thou of the soft low voice!—thou art not gone! Still breathes for me its faint and flute-like tone. And come to me!—sing me thy willow-strain, Sweet Desdemona! with the sad surprise In thy beseeching glance, where still, though vain, Undimm'd, unquenchable affection lies; Come, bowing thy young head to wrong and scorn, As a frail hyacinth, by showers o'erborne. And thou, too, fair Ophelia! flowers are here, That well might win thy footstep to the spot— Pale cowslips, meet for maiden's early bier, And pansies for sad thoughts, “Here's pansies for you—that's for thoughts.”Hamlet.—but needed not! Come with thy wreaths, and all the love and light In that wild eye still tremulously bright. And Juliet, vision of the south! enshrining All gifts that unto its rich heaven belong; The glow, the sweetness, in its rose combining, The soul its nightingales pour forth in song, Thou, making death deep joy!—but could'st thou die? No!—thy young love hath immortality! From earth's bright faces fades the light of morn, From earth's glad voices drops the joyous tone; But ye, the children of the soul, were born Deathless, and for undying love alone; And, oh! ye beautiful! 'tis well, how well, In the soul's world, with you, where change is not, to dwell! THE LYRE'S LAMENT. “A large lyre hung in an opening of the rock, and gave forth its melancholy music to the wind—but no human being was to be seen.” Salathiel. A deep-toned lyre hung murmuring To the wild wind of the sea: “O melancholy wind,” it sigh'd, “What would thy breath with me? “Thou can'st not wake the spirit That in me slumbering lies, Thou strikest not forth th' electric fire Of buried melodies. “Wind of the dark sea-waters! Thou dost but sweep my strings Into wild gusts of mournfulness, With the rushing of thy wings. “But the spell—the gift—the lightning— Within my frame conceal'd, Must I moulder on the rock away, With their triumphs unreveal'd? “I have power, high power, for freedom To wake the burning soul! I have sounds that through the ancient hills Like a torrent's voice might roll. “I have pealing notes of victory That might welcome kings from war; I have rich deep tones to send the wail For a hero's death afar. “I have chords to lift the pæan From the temple to the sky, Full as the forest-unisons When sweeping winds are high. “And love—for love's lone sorrow I have accents that might swell Through the summer air with the rose's breath, Or the violet's faint farewell: “Soft—spiritual—mournful— Sighs in each note enshrined— But who shall call that sweetness forth? Thou can'st not, ocean-wind! “I pass without my glory, Forgotten I decay— Where is the touch to give me life? —Wild, fitful wind, away!” So sigh'd the broken music That in gladness had no part— How like art thou, neglected lyre, To many a human heart! TASSO'S CORONATION. Tasso died at Rome on the day before that appointed for his coronation in the Capitol. A crown of victory! a triumphal song! Oh! call some friend, upon whose pitying heart The weary one may calmly sink to rest; Let some kind voice, beside his lowly couch, Pour the last prayer for mortal agony! A trumpet's note is in the sky, in the glorious Roman sky, Whose dome hath rung, so many an age, to the voice of victory; There is crowding to the Capitol, the imperial streets along, For again a conqueror must be crown'd—a kingly child of song: Yet his chariot lingers, Yet around his home Broods a shadow silently, 'Midst the joy of Rome. A thousand thousand laurel boughs are waving wide and far, To shed out their triumphal gleams around his rolling car; A thousand haunts of olden gods have given their wealth of flowers, To scatter o'er his path of fame bright hues in gemlike showers. Peace! within his chamber Low the mighty lies; With a cloud of dreams on his noble brow, And a wandering in his eyes. Sing, sing for him, the lord of song, for him, whose rushing strain In mastery o'er the spirit sweeps, like a strong wind o'er the main! Whose voice lives deep in burning hearts, for ever there to dwell, As full-toned oracles are shrined in a temple's holiest cell. Yes! for him, the victor, Sing—but low, sing low! A soft sad miserere chant For a soul about to go! The sun, the sun of Italy is pouring o'er his way, Where the old three hundred triumphs moved, a flood of golden day; Streaming through every haughty arch of the Cæsars' past renown— Bring forth, in that exulting light, the conqueror for his crown! Shut the proud bright sunshine From the fading sight! There needs no ray by the bed of death, Save the holy taper's light. The wreath is twined—the way is strewn—the lordly train are met— The streets are hung with coronals—why stays the minstrel yet? Shout! as an army shouts in joy around a royal chief— Bring forth the bard of chivalry, the bard of love and grief! Silence! forth we bring him, In his last array; From love and grief the freed, the flown— Way for the bier—make way! THE BETTER LAND. “I hear thee speak of the better land, Thou call'st its children a happy band; Mother! oh, where is that radiant shore? Shall we not seek it, and weep no more? Is it where the flower of the orange blows, And the fire-flies glance through the myrtle boughs?” —“Not there, not there, my child!” “Is it where the feathery palm-trees rise, And the date grows ripe under sunny skies? Or 'midst the green islands of glittering seas, Where fragrant forests perfume the breeze, And strange bright birds on their starry wings, Bear the rich hues of all glorious things?” —“Not there, not there, my child!” “Is it far away, in some region old, Where the rivers wander o'er sands of gold?— Where the burning rays of the ruby shine, And the diamond lights up the secret mine, And the pearl gleams forth from the coral strand?— Is it there, sweet mother, that better land?” —“Not there, not there, my child!” “Eye hath not seen it, my gentle boy! Ear hath not heard its deep songs of joy; Dreams cannot picture a world so fair— Sorrow and death may not enter there: Time doth not breathe on its fadeless bloom, For beyond the clouds, and beyond the tomb, —It is there, it is there, my child!” THE WOUNDED EAGLE. Eagle! this is not thy sphere! Warrior-bird! what seek'st thou here? Wherefore by the fountain's brink Doth thy royal pinion sink? Wherefore on the violet's bed Lay'st thou thus thy drooping head? Thou, that hold'st the blast in scorn, Thou, that wear'st the wings of morn! Eagle! wilt thou not arise? Look upon thine own bright skies! Lift thy glance! the fiery sun There his pride of place hath won! And the mountain lark is there, And sweet sound hath fill'd the air; Hast thou left that realm on high? —Oh! it can be but to die! Eagle, eagle! thou hast bow'd From thine empire o'er the cloud! Thou, that had'st ethereal birth, Thou hast stoop'd too near the earth, And the hunter's shaft hath found thee, And the toils of death have bound thee! —Wherefore didst thou leave thy place, Creature of a kingly race? Wert thou weary of thy throne? Was thy sky's dominion lone? Chill and lone it well might be, Yet that mighty wing was free! Now the chain is o'er it cast, From thy heart the blood flows fast, —Woe for gifted souls and high! Is not such their destiny? SADNESS AND MIRTH. “Nay, these wild fits of uncurb'd laughter Athwart the gloomy tenor of your mind, As it has lower'd of late, so keenly cast, Unsuited seem, and strange. Oh! nothing strange, Did'st thou ne'er see the swallow's veering breast, Winging the air beneath some murky cloud, In the sunn'd glimpses of a troubled day, Shiver in silvery brightness? Or boatman's oar, as vivid lightning flash In the faint gleam, that, like a spirit's path, Tracks the still waters of some sullen lake? O, gentle friend! Chide not her mirth, who yesterday was sad, And may be so to-morrow!” Joanna Baillie. Ye met at the stately feasts of old, Where the bright wine foam'd over sculptured gold, Sadness and mirth! ye were mingled there With the sound of the lyre in the scented air; As the cloud and the lightning are blent on high, Ye mix'd in the gorgeous revelry. For there hung o'er those banquets of yore a gloom, A thought and a shadow of the tomb; It gave to the flute-notes an under-tone, To the rose a colouring not its own, To the breath of the myrtle a mournful power— Sadness and mirth! ye had each your dower! Ye met when the triumph swept proudly by, With the Roman eagles through the sky! I know that even then, in his hour of pride, The soul of the mighty within him died; That a void in his bosom lay darkly still, Which the music of victory might never fill! Thou wert there, oh, mirth! swelling on the shout, Till the temples, like echo-caves, rang out; Thine were the garlands, the songs, the wine, All the rich voices in air were thine, The incense, the sunshine—but, sadness, thy part, Deepest of all, was the victor's heart! Ye meet at the bridal with flower and tear; Strangely and wildly ye meet by the bier! As the gleam from a sea-bird's white wing shed, Crosses the storm in its path of dread; As a dirge meets the breeze of a summer sky— Sadness and mirth! so ye come and fly! Ye meet in the poet's haunted breast, Darkness and rainbow, alike its guest! When the breath of the violet is out in spring, When the woods with the wakening of music ring, O'er his dreamy spirit your currents pass, Like shadow and sunlight o'er mountain grass. When will your parting be, sadness and mirth? Bright stream and dark one!—oh! never on earth! Never while triumphs and tombs are so near, While death and love walk the same dim sphere, While flowers unfold where the storm may sweep, While the heart of man is a soundless deep! But there smiles a land, oh! ye troubled pair! Where ye have no part in the summer air. Far from the breathings of changeful skies, Over the seas and the graves it lies; Where the day of the lightning and cloud is done, And joy reigns alone, as the lonely sun! THE NIGHTINGALE'S DEATH-SONG. Willst du nach den Nachtigallen fragen, Die mit seelenvollen Melodie Dich entzückten in des Lenzes Tagen? —Nur so lang sie liebten, waren sie. Schiller. Mournfully, sing mournfully, And die away, my heart! The rose, the glorious rose is gone, And I, too, will depart. The skies have lost their splendour, The waters changed their tone, And wherefore, in the faded world, Should music linger on? Where is the golden sunshine, And where flower-cup's glow? And where the joy of the dancing leaves, And the fountain's laughing flow? A voice, in every whisper Of the wave, the bough, the air, Comes asking for the beautiful, And moaning, “Where, oh! where?” Tell of the brightness parted, Thou bee, thou lamb at play! Thou lark, in thy victorious mirth! —Are ye, too, pass'd away? Mournfully, sing mournfully! The royal rose is gone. Melt from the woods, my spirit, melt In one deep farewell tone! Not so, swell forth triumphantly, The full, rich, fervent strain! Hence with young love and life I go, In the summer's joyous train. With sunshine, with sweet odour, With every precious thing, Upon the last warm southern breeze My soul its flight shall wing. Alone I shall not linger, When the days of hope are past, To watch the fall of leaf by leaf, To wait the rushing blast. Triumphantly, triumphantly! Sing to the woods, I go! For me, perchance, in other lands, The glorious rose may blow. The sky's transparent azure, And the greensward's violet breath, And the dance of light leaves in the wind, May there know nought of death, No more, no more sing mournfully! Swell high, then break, my heart With love, the spirit of the woods, With summer I depart! THE DIVER. “They learn in suffering what they teach in song.” Shelley. Thou hast been where the rocks of coral grow, Thou hast fought with eddying waves;— Thy cheek is pale, and thy heart beats low, Thou searcher of ocean's caves! Thou hast look'd on the gleaming wealth of old, And wrecks where the brave have striven: The deep is a strong and a fearful hold, But thou its bar hast riven! A wild and weary life is thine; A wasting task and lone, Though treasure-grots for thee may shine, To all besides unknown! A weary life! but a swift decay Soon, soon shall set thee free; Thou'rt passing fast from thy toils away, Thou wrestler with the sea! In thy dim eye, on thy hollow cheek, Well are the death-signs read— Go! for the pearl in its cavern seek, Ere hope and power be fled! And bright in beauty's coronal That glistening gem shall be; A star to all in the festive hall— But who will think on thee? None!—as it gleams from the queen-like head, Not one 'midst throngs will say, “A life hath been like a rain-drop shed, For that pale quivering ray.” Woe for the wealth thus dearly bought! —And are not those like thee, Who win for earth the gems of thought? O wrestler with the sea! Down to the gulfs of the soul they go, Where the passion-fountains burn, Gathering the jewels far below From many a buried urn: Wringing from lava-veins the fire, That o'er bright words is pour'd; Learning deep sounds, to make the lyre A spirit in each chord. But, oh! the price of bitter tears, Paid for the lonely power That throws at last o'er desert years, A darkly glorious dower! Like flower-seeds, by the wild wind spread, So radiant thoughts are strew'd; —The soul whence those high gifts are shed, May faint in solitude! And who will think, when the strain is sung Till a thousand hearts are stirr'd, What life-drops, from the minstrel wrung, Have gush'd with every word? None, none!—his treasures live like thine, He strives and dies like thee; —Thou, that hast been to the pearl's dark shrine, O wrestler with the sea! THE REQUIEM OF GENIUS. “Les poetes dont l'imagination tient à la puissance d'aimer et de souffrir, ne sont ils pas les bannis d'une autre region?” Madame de Staël—De L' Allemagne. No tears for thee!—though light be from us gone With thy soul's radiance, bright, yet restless one! No tears for thee! They that have loved an exile, must not mourn To see him parting for his native bourne O'er the dark sea. All the high music of thy spirit here, Breathed but the language of another sphere, Unecho'd round; And strange, though sweet, as 'midst our weeping skies Some half-remember'd strain of paradise Might sadly sound. Hast thou been answer'd? thou, that from the night And from the voices of the tempest's might, And from the past, Wert seeking still some oracle's reply, To pour the secrets of man's destiny Forth on the blast! Hast thou been answer'd?—thou, that through the gloom, And shadow, and stern silence of the tomb, A cry did'st send, So passionate and deep? to pierce, to move, To win back token of unburied love From buried friend! And hast thou found where living waters burst? Thou that did'st pine amidst us, in the thirst Of fever-dreams! Are the true fountains thine for evermore? Oh! lured so long by shining mists, that wore The light of streams! Speak! it is well with thee?—We call, as thou, With thy lit eye, deep voice, and kindled brow, Wert wont to call On the departed! Art thou bless'd and free? —Alas! the lips earth covers, even to thee, Were silent all! Yet shall our hope rise fann'd by quenchless faith, As a flame, foster'd by some warm wind's breath, In light upsprings: Freed soul of song! yes, thou hast found the sought; Borne to thy home of beauty and of thought, On morning's wings. And we will dream it is thy joy we hear, When life's young music, ringing far and clear, O'erflows the sky:— No tears for thee! the lingering gloom is ours— Thou art for converse with all glorious powers, Never to die! TRIUMPHANT MUSIC. “Tacete, tacete, O suoni trionfanti! Risvegliate in vano'l cor che non può liberarsi.” Wherefore and whither bear'st thou up my spirit, On eagle wings, through every plume that thrill? It hath no crown of victory to inherit— Be still, triumphant harmony! be still! Thine are no sounds for earth, thus proudly swelling Into rich floods of joy:—it is but pain To mount so high, yet find on high no dwelling, To sink so fast, so heavily again! No sounds for earth?—Yes, to young chieftain dying On his own battle-field, at set of sun, With his freed country's banner o'er him flying, Well might'st thou speak of fame's high guerdon won. No sounds for earth?—Yes, for the martyr leading Unto victorious death serenely on, For patriot by his rescued altars bleeding, Thou hast a voice in each majestic tone. But speak not thus to one whose heart is beating Against life's narrow bound, in conflict vain! For power, for joy, high hope, and rapturous greeting, Thou wakest lone thirst—be hush'd, exulting strain! Be hush'd, or breathe of grief!—of exile yearnings Under the willows of the stranger-shore; Breathe of the soul's untold and restless burnings, For looks, tones, footsteps, that return no more. Breathe of deep love—a lonely vigil keeping Through the night-hours, o'er wasted wealth to pine; Rich thoughts and sad, like faded rose-leaves heaping, In the shut heart, at once a tomb and shrine. Or pass as if thy spirit-notes came sighing From worlds beneath some blue Elysian sky; Breathe of repose, the pure, the bright, the undying— Of joy no more—bewildering harmony! SECOND SIGHT. “Ne'er err'd the prophet heart that grief inspired, Though joy's illusions mock their votarist.” Maturin. A mournful gift is mine, O friends! A mournful gift is mine! A murmur of the soul which blends With the flow of song and wine. An eye that through the triumph's hour Beholds the coming woe, And dwells upon the faded flower 'Midst the rich summer's glow. Ye smile to view fair faces bloom Where the father's board is spread; I see the stillness and the gloom Of a home whence all are fled. I see the wither'd garlands lie Forsaken on the earth, While the lamps yet burn, and the dancers fly Through the ringing hall of mirth. I see the blood-red future stain On the warrior's gorgeous crest; And the bier amidst the bridal train When they come with roses drest. I hear the still small moan of time, Through the ivy branches made, Where the palace, in its glory's prime, With the sunshine stands array'd. The thunder of the seas I hear, The shriek along the wave, When the bark sweeps forth, and song and cheer Salute the parting brave. With every breeze a spirit sends To me some warning sign:— A mournful gift is mine, O friends! A mournful gift is mine! Oh! prophet heart! thy grief, thy power, To all deep souls belong; The shadow in the sunny hour, The wail in the mirthful song. Their sight is all too sadly clear— For them a veil is riven: Their piercing thoughts repose not here, Their home is but in Heaven. THE SEA-BIRD FLYING INLAND. Thy path is not as mine;—where thou art blest, My spirit would but wither; mine own grief Is in mine eyes a richer, holier thing, Than all thy happiness. Hath the summer's breath on the south-wind borne, Met the dark seas in their sweeping scorn? Hath it lured thee, Bird! from their sounding caves, To the river shores where the osier waves? Or art thou come on the hills to dwell, Where the sweet-voiced echoes have many a cell? Where the moss bears print of the wild-deer's tread, And the heath like a royal robe is spread? Thou hast done well, O thou bright sea-bird! There is joy where the song of the lark is heard, With the dancing of waters through copse and dell, And the bee's low tune in the fox-glove's bell. Thou hast done well:—Oh! the seas are lone, And the voice they send up hath a mournful tone; A mingling of dirges and wild farewells, Fitfully breathed through its anthem-swells. —The proud bird rose as the words were said— The rush of his pinion swept o'er my head, And the glance of his eye, in its bright disdain, Spoke him a child of the haughty main. He hath flown from the woods to the ocean's breast, To his throne of pride on the billow's crest —Oh! who shall say, to a spirit free, “There lies the pathway of bliss for thee?” THE SLEEPER. “For sleep is awful.” Byron. Oh! lightly, lightly tread! A holy thing is sleep, On the worn spirit shed, And eyes that wake to weep. A holy thing from Heaven, A gracious dewy cloud, A covering mantle given The weary to enshroud. Oh! lightly, lightly tread! Revere the pale still brow, The meekly-drooping head, The long hair's willowy flow. Ye know not what ye do, That call the slumberer back, From the world unseen by you Unto life's dim faded track. Her soul is far away, In her childhood's land, perchance, Where her young sisters play, Where shines her mother's glance. Some old sweet native sound Her spirit haply weaves; A harmony profound Of woods with all their leaves; A murmur of the sea, A laughing tone of streams:— Long may her sojourn be In the music land of dreams! Each voice of love is there, Each gleam of beauty fled, Each lost one still more fair— Oh! lightly, lightly tread! THE MIRROR IN THE DESERTED HALL. O, dim, forsaken mirror! How many a stately throng Hath o'er thee gleam'd, in vanish'd hours Of the wine-cup and the song! The song hath left no echo; The bright wine hath been quaff'd; And hush'd is every silvery voice That lightly here hath laugh'd. Oh! mirror, lonely mirror, Thou of the silent hall! Thou hast been flush'd with beauty's bloom— Is this, too, vanish'd all? It is, with the scatter'd garlands Of triumphs long ago; With the melodies of buried lyres; With the faded rainbow's glow. And for all the gorgeous pageants, For the glance of gem and plume, For lamp, and harp, and rosy wreath, And vase of rich perfume. Now, dim, forsaken mirror, Thou givest but faintly back The quiet stars, and the sailing moon, On her solitary track. And thus with man's proud spirit Thou tellest me 'twill be, When the forms and hues of this world fade From his memory, as from thee: And his heart's long-troubled waters At last in stillness lie, Reflecting but the images Of the solemn world on high. TO THE DAUGHTER OF BERNARD BARTON, THE QUAKER POET. Happy thou art, the child of one Who in each lowly flower, Each leaf that glances to the sun, Or trembles with the shower; In each soft shadow of the sky, Or sparkle of the stream, Will guide thy kindling spirit's eye To trace the Love Supreme. So shall deep quiet fill thy breast, A joy in wood and wild;— And e'en for this I call thee blest, The gentle poet's child! THE STAR OF THE MINE. From the deep chambers of a mine, With heavy gloom o'erspread, I saw a star at noontide shine, Serenely o'er my head. I had not seen it 'midst the glow Of the rich upper day; But in that shadowy world below, How my heart bless'd its ray! And still, the farther from my sight Torches and lamps were borne, The purer, lovelier, seem'd the light That wore its beams unshorn. Oh! what is like that heavenly spark? —A friend's kind, steadfast eye; Where, brightest when the world grows dark, Hope, cheer, and comfort lie! WASHINGTON'S STATUE. SENT FROM ENGLAND TO AMERICA. Yes! rear thy guardian hero's form On thy proud soil, thou western world! A watcher through each sign of storm, O'er freedom's flag unfurl'd. There, as before a shrine, to bow, Bid thy true sons their children lead: The language of that noble brow For all things good shall plead. The spirit rear'd in patriot fight, The virtue born of home and hearth, There calmly throned, a holy light Shall pour o'er chainless earth. And let that work of England's hand, Sent through the blast and surge's roar, So girt with tranquil glory stand, For ages on thy shore! Such, through all time, the greetings be, That with the Atlantic billow sweep! Telling the mighty and the free Of brothers o'er the deep. A THOUGHT OF HOME AT SEA. WRITTEN FOR MUSIC. Tis lone on the waters When eve's mournful bell Sends forth to the sunset A note of farewell; When, borne with the shadows And winds as they sweep, There comes a fond memory Of home o'er the deep; When the wing of the sea-bird Is turn'd to her nest, And the thought of the sailor To all he loves best! 'Tis lone on the waters— That hour hath a spell— To bring back sweet voices, With words of farewell! TO THE MEMORY OF A SISTER-IN-LAW. We miss thy voice while early flowers are blowing, And the first flush of blossom clothes each bough, And the Spring sunshine round our home is glowing Soft as thy smile. Thou should'st be with us now. With us? we wrong thee by the earthly thought. Could our fond gaze but follow where thou art, Well might the glories of this world seem nought To the one promise given the pure in heart. Yet wert thou blest e'en here—oh! ever blest In thine own sunny thoughts and tranquil faith! The silent joy that still o'erflow'd thy breast, Needed but guarding from all change, by death. So is it seal'd to peace!—on thy clear brow Never was care one fleeting shade to cast; And thy calm days in brightness were to flow, A holy stream, untroubled to the last. Farewell! thy life hath left surviving love A wealth of records, and sweet “feelings given,” From sorrow's heart the faintness to remove, By whispers breathing “less of earth than heaven.” Alluding to the lines she herself quoted but an hour before her death:— “Some feelings are to mortals given, With less of earth in them than heaven.” Thus rests thy spirit still on those with whom Thy step the paths of joyous duty trod, Bidding them make an altar of thy tomb, Where chasten'd thought may offer praise to God. April 1826. TO AN ORPHAN. Thou hast been rear'd too tenderly, Beloved too well and long, Watch'd by too many a gentle eye— Now look on life—be strong! Too quiet seem'd thy joys for change, Too holy and too deep; Bright clouds, through summer skies that range, Seem oft-times thus to sleep:— To sleep in silvery stillness bound, As things that ne'er may melt; Yet gaze again—no trace is found To show thee where they dwelt. This world hath no more love to give Like that which thou hast known; Yet the heart breaks not—we survive Our treasures—and bear on. But oh! too beautiful and blest Thy home of youth hath been! Where shall thy wing, poor bird, find rest, Shut out from that sweet scene? Kind voices from departed years Must haunt thee many a day; Looks that will smite the source of tears. Across thy soul must play. Friends—now the altered or the dead, And music that is gone— A gladness o'er thy dreams will shed, And thou shalt wake—alone. Alone! it is in that deep word That all thy sorrow lies; How is the heart to courage stirr'd By smiles from kindred eyes! And are these lost?—and have I said To aught like thee—be strong? —So bid the willow lift its head And brave the tempest's wrong! Thou reed! o'er which the storm hath pass'd— Thou shaken with the wind! On one, one friend thy weakness cast— There is but One to bind! HYMN BY THE SICKBED OF A MOTHER. Father! that in the olive shade When the dark hour came on, Didst, with a breath of heavenly aid, Strengthen thy Son; Oh! by the anguish of that night, Send us down bless'd relief; Or to the chasten'd, let thy might Hallow this grief! And Thou, that when the starry sky Saw the dread strife begun, Didst teach adoring faith to cry, “Thy will be done;” By thy meek spirit, Thou, of all That e'er have mourn'd the chief— Thou Saviour! if the stroke must fall, Hallow this grief! WHERE IS THE SEA? SONG OF THE GREEK ISLANDER IN EXILE. Where is the sea?—I languish here— Where is my own blue sea? With all its barks in fleet career, And flags, and breezes free. I miss that voice of waves which first Awoke my childhood's glee; The measured chime—the thundering burst— Where is my own blue sea? Oh! rich your myrtle's breath may rise, Soft, soft your winds may be; Yet my sick heart within me dies— Where is my own blue sea? I hear the shepherd's mountain flute— I hear the whispering tree;— The echoes of my soul are mute: —Where is my own blue sea? TO MY OWN PORTRAIT. Painted by W. E. West, in 1827, and engraved in the first volume of this publication. How is it that before mine eyes, While gazing on thy mien, All my past years of life arise, As in a mirror seen? What spell within thee hath been shrined, To image back my own deep mind? Even as a song of other times Can trouble memory's springs; Even as a sound of vesper-chimes Can wake departed things; Even as a scent of vernal flowers Hath records fraught with vanish'd hours;— Such power is thine!—they come, the dead, From the grave's bondage free, And smiling back the changed are led, To look in love on thee; And voices that are music flown Speak to me in the heart's full tone: Till crowding thoughts my soul oppress— The thoughts of happier years, And a vain gush of tenderness O'erflows in child-like tears; A passion which I may not stay, A sudden fount that must have way, But thou, the while—oh! almost strange, Mine imaged self! it seems That on thy brow of peace no change Reflects my own swift dreams; Almost I marvel not to trace Those lights and shadows in thy face. To see thee calm, while powers thus deep Affection—Memory—Grief— Pass o'er my soul as winds that sweep O'er a frail aspen-leaf! O that the quiet of thine eye Might sink there when the storm goes by! Yet look thou still serenely on, And if sweet friends there be, That when my song and soul are gone Shall seek my form in thee,— Tell them of one for whom 'twas best To flee away and be at rest! NO MORE. No more! a harp-string's deep and breaking tone, A last low summer breeze, a far-off swell, A dying echo of rich music gone, Breathe through those words—those murmurs of farewell— No more! To dwell in peace, with home affections bound, To know the sweetness of a mother's voice, To feel the spirit of her love around, And in the blessing of her eye rejoice— No more! A dirge-like sound! to greet the early friend Unto the hearth, his place of many days; In the glad song with kindred lips to blend, Or join the household laughter by the blaze— No more! Through woods that shadow'd our first years to rove, With all our native music in the air; To watch the sunset with the eyes we love, And turn, and read our own heart's answer there— No more! Words of despair! yet earth's, all earth's—the woe Their passion breathes—the desolately deep! That sound in Heaven—oh! image then the flow Of gladness in its tones—to part, to weep— No more! To watch, in dying hope, affection's wane, To see the beautiful from life depart, To wear impatiently a secret chain, To waste the untold riches of the heart— No more! Through long, long years to seek, to strive, to yearn For human love “Jamais, jamais, je ne serai aimé comme j'aime,” was a mournful expression of Madame de Staël's.—and never quench that thirst, To pour the soul out, winning no return, O'er fragile idols, by delusion nursed— No more! On things that fail us, reed by reed, to lean, To mourn the changed, the far away, the dead; To send our troubled spirits through the unseen, Intensely questioning for treasures fled— No more! Words of triumphant music—bear we on The weight of life, the chain, the ungenial air; Their deathless meaning, when our tasks are done, To learn in joy;—to struggle, to despair— No more! THOUGHT FROM AN ITALIAN POET. Where shall I find, in all this fleeting earth, This world of changes and farewells, a friend That will not fail me in his love and worth, Tender and firm, and faithful to the end? Far hath my spirit sought a place of rest— Long on vain idols its devotion shed; Some have forsaken whom I loved the best, And some deceived, and some are with the dead. But thou, my Saviour! thou, my hope and trust, Faithful art thou when friends and joys depart; Teach me to lift these yearnings from the dust, And fix on thee, th' unchanging One, my heart! PASSING AWAY. “Passing away” is written on the world, and all the world contains. It is written on the rose, In its glory's full array— Read what those buds disclose— “Passing away.” It is written on the skies Of the soft blue summer day; It is traced in sunset's dyes— “Passing away.” It is written on the trees, As their young leaves glistening play, And on brighter things than these— “Passing away.” It is written on the brow Where the spirit's ardent ray Lives, burns, and triumphs now— “Passing away.” It is written on the heart— Alas! that there Decay Should claim from Love a part— “Passing away.” Friends, friends!—oh! shall we meet In a land of purer day, Where lovely things and sweet Pass not away? Shall we know each other's eyes, And the thoughts that in them lay, When we mingled sympathies— “Passing away?” Oh! if this may be so, Speed, speed thou closing day! How blest, from earth's vain show To pass away! THE ANGLER. This, and the following poem, were originally written for a work entitled Death's Doings, edited by Mr Alaric Watts. “I in these flowery meads would be; These crystal streams should solace me; To whose harmonious bubbling noise I with my angle would rejoice; And angle on, and beg to have A quiet passage to a welcome grave.” Isaac Walton. Thou that hast loved so long and well The vale's deep quiet streams, Where the pure water-lilies dwell, Shedding forth tender gleams; And o'er the pool the May-fly's wing Glances in golden eves of spring. Oh! lone and lovely haunts are thine, Soft, soft the river flows, Wearing the shadow of thy line, The gloom of alder-boughs; And in the midst, a richer hue, One gliding vein of heaven's own blue. And there but low sweet sounds are heard— The whisper of the reed, The plashing trout, the rustling bird, The scythe upon the mead: Yet, through the murmuring osiers near, There steals a step which mortals fear. 'Tis not the stag, that comes to lave, At noon, his panting breast; 'Tis not the bittern, by the wave Seeking her sedgy nest; The air is fill'd with summer's breath, The young flowers laugh—yet look! 'tis death! But if, where silvery currents rove, Thy heart, grown still and sage, Hath learn'd to read the words of love That shine o'er nature's page; If holy thoughts thy guests have been, Under the shade of willows green; Then, lover of the silent hour, By deep lone waters past, Thence hast thou drawn a faith, a power, To cheer thee through the last; And, wont on brighter worlds to dwell, May'st calmly bid thy streams farewell. DEATH AND THE WARRIOR. “Ay, warrior, arm! and wear thy plume On a proud and fearless brow! I am the lord of the lonely tomb, And a mightier one than thou! “Bid thy soul's love farewell, young chief— Bid her a long farewell! Like the morning's dew shall pass that grief— Thou comest with me to dwell! “Thy bark may rush through the foaming deep Thy steed o'er the breezy hill; But they bear thee on to a place of sleep, Narrow, and cold, and chill!” “Was the voice I heard, thy voice, oh Death! And is thy day so near? Then on the field shall my life's last breath Mingle with victory's cheer! “Banners shall float, with the trumpet's note, Above me as I die! And the palm-tree wave o'er my noble grave, Under the Syrian sky. “High hearts shall burn in the royal hall, When the minstrel names that spot; And the eyes I love shall weep my fall,— Death, Death, I fear thee not!” “Warrior! thou bear'st a haughty heart, But I can bend its pride! How should'st thou know that thy soul will part In the hour of victory's tide? “It may be far from thy steel-clad bands, That I shall make thee mine; It may be lone on the desert sands, Where men for fountains pine! “It may be deep amidst heavy chains, In some deep Paynim hold;— I have slow dull steps and lingering pains, Wherewith to tame the bold!” “Death, Death! I go to a doom unblest, If this indeed must be; But the Cross is bound upon my breast, And I may not shrink for thee! “Sound, clarion, sound!—for my vows are given To the cause of the holy shrine; I bow my soul to the will of Heaven, Oh Death!—and not to thine!” SONG FOR AIR BY HUMMEL. Oh! if thou wilt not give thine heart, Give back my own to me; For if in thine I have no part, Why should mine dwell with thee? The first verse of this song is a literal translation from the German. Yet no! this mournful love of mine, I will not from me cast; Let me but dream 'twill win me thine, By its deep truth at last! Can aught so fond, so faithful, live Through years without reply? —Oh! if thy heart thou wilt not give, Give me a thought, a sigh! TO THE MEMORY OF LORD CHARLES MURRAY, SON OF THE DUKE OF ATHOLL, WHO DIED IN THE CAUSE, AND LAMENTED BY THE PEOPLE OF GREECE. “Time cannot teach forgetfulness, When grief's full heart is fed by fame.” Byron. Thou should'st have slept beneath the stately pines, And with the ancestral trophies of thy race; Thou that hast found, where alien tombs and shrines Speak of the past, a lonely dwelling-place! Far from thy brethren hath thy couch been spread, Thou bright young stranger 'midst the mighty dead! Yet to thy name a noble rite was given, Banner and dirge met proudly o'er thy grave, Under that old and glorious Grecian heaven, Which unto death so oft hath lit the brave: And thy dust blends with mould heroic there, With all that sanctifies the inspiring air. Vain voice of fame! sad sound for those that weep, For her, the mother, in whose bosom lone Thy childhood dwells—whose thoughts a record keep Of smiles departed and sweet accents gone; Of all thine early grace and gentle worth— A vernal promise, faded now from earth! But a bright memory claims a proud regret— A lofty sorrow finds its own deep springs Of healing balm; and she hath treasures yet, Whose soul can number with love's holy things, A name like thine! Now, past all cloud or spot, A gem is hers, laid up where change is not. THE BROKEN CHAIN. I am free!—I have burst through my galling chain, The life of young eagles is mine again; I may cleave with my bark the glad sounding sea, I may rove where the wind roves—my path is free! The streams dash in joy down the summer hill, The birds pierce the depths of the sky at will, The arrow goes forth with the singing breeze,— And is not my spirit as one of these? Oh! the green earth with its wealth of flowers, And the voices that ring through its forest bowers, And the laughing glance of the founts that shine, Lighting the valleys—all, all are mine! I may urge through the desert my foaming steed, The wings of the morning shall lend him speed; I may meet the storm in its rushing glee— Its blasts and its lightnings are not more free! Captive! and hast thou then rent thy chain? Art thou free in the wilderness, free on the main? Yes! there thy spirit may proudly soar, But must thou not mingle with throngs the more? The bird when he pineth, may hush his song, Till the hour when his heart shall again be strong; But thou—canst thou turn in thy woe aside, And weep, 'midst thy brethren?—no, not for pride. May the fiery word from thy lip find way, When the thoughts burning in thee shall spring to day? May the care that sits in thy weary breast Look forth from thine aspect, the revel's guest? No! with the shaft in thy bosom borne, Thou must hide the wound in thy fear of scorn; Thou must fold thy mantle that none may see, And mask thee with laughter, and say thou art free! No! thou art chain'd till thy race is run, By the power of all in the soul of one; On thy heart, on thy lip, must the fetter be— Dreamer, fond dreamer! oh! who is free? THE SHADOW OF A FLOWER. “La voilà telle que la mort nous l'a faite.” Bossuet. 'Twas a dream of olden days, That Art, by some strange power, The visionary form could raise From the ashes of a flower. That a shadow of the rose, By its own meek beauty bow'd, Might slowly, leaf by leaf, unclose, Like pictures in a cloud. Or the hyacinth, to grace, As a second rainbow, Spring; Of Summer's path a dreary trace, A fair, yet mournful thing! For the glory of the bloom That a flush around it shed, And the soul within, the rich perfume, Where were they?—fled, all fled! Nought but the dim faint line To speak of vanish'd hours— Memory! what are joys of thine? —Shadows of buried flowers! LINES TO A BUTTERFLY RESTING ON A SKULL Creature of air and light! Emblem of that which will not fade or die! Wilt thou not speed thy flight, To chase the south wind through the glowing sky? What lures thee thus to stay With silence and decay, Fix'd on the wreck of cold mortality? The thoughts once chamber'd there, Have gather'd up their treasures and are gone;— Will the dust tell thee where That which hath burst the prison-house is flown? Rise, nursling of the day! If thou would'st trace its way— Earth has no voice to make the secret known. Who seeks the vanish'd bird Near the deserted nest and broken shell? Far thence, by us unheard, He sings, rejoicing in the woods to dwell: Thou of the sunshine born, Take the bright wings of morn! Thy hope springs heavenward from yon ruin'd cell. THE BELL AT SEA. When the tide's billowy swell Had reach'd its height, Then toll'd the rock's lone bell, Sternly by night. Far over cliff and surge Swept the deep sound, Making each wild wind's dirge Still more profound. Yet that funereal tone The sailor bless'd, Steering through darkness on With fearless breast. E'en so may we, that float On life's wide sea, Welcome each warning note, Stern though it be! THE SUBTERRANEAN STREAM. “Thou stream, Whose source is inaccessibly profound, Whither do thy mysterious waters tend? —Thou imagest my life.” Darkly thou glidest onward, Thou deep and hidden wave! The laughing sunshine hath not look'd Into thy secret cave. Thy current makes no music— A hollow sound we hear, A muffled voice of mystery, And know that thou art near. No brighter line of verdure Follows thy lonely way; No fairy moss, or lily's cup, Is freshen'd by thy play. The halcyon doth not seek thee, Her glorious wings to lave; Thou know'st no tint of the summer sky, Thou dark and hidden wave! Yet once will day behold thee, When to the mighty sea, Fresh bursting from their cavern'd veins. Leap thy lone waters free. There wilt thou greet the sunshine For a moment, and be lost, With all thy melancholy sounds, In the ocean's billowy host. Oh! art thou not, dark river, Like the fearful thoughts untold, Which haply in the hush of night O'er many a soul have roll'd? Those earth-born strange misgivings— Who hath not felt their power? Yet who hath breathed them to his friend, E'en in his fondest hour? They hold no heart communion, They find no voice in song, They dimly follow far from earth The grave's departed throng. Wild is their course, and lonely, And fruitless in man's breast; They come and go, and leave no trace Of their mysterious guest. Yet surely must their wanderings At length be like thy way; Their shadows, as thy waters, lost In one bright flood of day! THE SILENT MULTITUDE. “For we are many in our solitudes.” Lament of Tasso. A mighty and a mingled throng Were gather'd in one spot; The dwellers of a thousand homes— Yet 'midst them voice was not. The soldier and his chief were there— The mother and her child: The friends, the sisters of one hearth— None spoke—none moved—none smiled. There lovers met, between whose lives Years had swept darkly by; After that heart-sick hope deferr'd— They met—but silently. You might have heard the rustling leaf, The breeze's faintest sound, The shiver of an insect's wing, On that thick-peopled ground. Your voice to whispers would have died For the deep quiet's sake; Your tread the softest moss have sought, Such stillness not to break. What held the countless multitude Bound in that spell of peace? How could the ever-sounding life Amid so many cease? Was it some pageant of the air— Some glory high above, That link'd and hush'd those human souls In reverential love? Or did some burdening passion's weight Hang on their indrawn breath? Awe—the pale awe that freezes words? Fear—the strong fear of death? A mightier thing—Death, Death himself Lay on each lonely heart! Kindred were there—yet hermits all— Thousands—but each apart. THE ANTIQUE SEPULCHRE. “Les sarcophages même chez les anciens, ne rapellent que des idées guerrières ou riantes:—on voit des jeux, des danses, representés en bas-relief sur les tombeaux.” Corinne. O ever joyous band Of revellers amidst the southern vines! On the pale marble, by some gifted hand, Fixed in undying lines! Thou, with the sculptured bowl, And thou, that wearest the immortal wreath, And thou, from whose young lip and flute, the soul Of music seems to breathe; And ye, luxuriant flowers! Linking the dancers with your graceful ties, And cluster'd fruitage, born of sunny hours, Under Italian skies: Ye, that a thousand springs, And leafy summers with their odorous breath, May yet outlast,—what do ye there, bright things! Mantling the place of death? Of sunlight and soft air, And Dorian reeds, and myrtles ever green, Unto the heart a glowing thought ye bear;— Why thus, where dust hath been? Is it to show how slight The bound that severs festivals and tombs, Music and silence, roses and the blight, Crowns and sepulchral glooms? Or when the father laid Haply his child's pale ashes here to sleep, When the friend visited the cypress shade, Flowers o'er the dead to heap; Say if the mourners sought, In these rich images of summer mirth, These wine-cups and gay wreaths, to lose the thought Of our last hour on earth? Ye have no voice, no sound, Ye flutes and lyres, to tell me what I seek; Silent ye are, light forms with vine-leaves crown'd, Yet to my soul ye speak. Alas! for those that lay Down in the dust without their hope of old! Backward they look'd on life's rich banquet-day, But all beyond was cold. Every sweet wood-note then, And through the plane-trees every sunbeam's glow, And each glad murmur from the homes of men, Made it more hard to go. But we, when life grows dim, When its last melodies float o'er our way, Its changeful hues before us faintly swim, Its flitting lights decay;— E'en though we bid farewell Unto the spring's blue skies and budding trees, Yet may we lift our hearts, in hope to dwell 'Midst brighter things than these. And think of deathless flowers, And of bright streams to glorious valleys given, And know the while, how little dream of ours Can shadow forth of Heaven EVENING SONG OF THE TYROLESE PEASANTS. “The loved hour of repose is striking. Let us come to the sunset tree.” See Captain Sherer's interesting Notes and Reflections during a Ramble in Germany. Come to the sunset tree! The day is past and gone; The woodman's axe lies free, And the reaper's work is done. The twilight star to heaven, And the summer dew to flowers, And rest to us, is given By the cool soft evening hours. Sweet is the hour of rest! Pleasant the wind's low sigh, And the gleaming of the west, And the turf whereon we lie; When the burden and the heat Of labour's task are o'er, And kindly voices greet The tired one at his door. Come to the sunset tree! The day is past and gone; The woodman's axe lies free, And the reaper's work is done Yes; tuneful is the sound That dwells in whispering boughs; Welcome the freshness round! And the gale that fans our brows. But rest more sweet and still Than ever nightfall gave, Our yearning hearts shall fill In the world beyond the grave. There shall no tempest blow, No scorching noontide heat; There shall be no more snow, “Wohl ihm, er ist hingegangen Wo kein schnoe mehr ist.”Schiller's Nadowessiche Todtenklage. No weary wandering feet. So we lift our trusting eyes From the hills our fathers trode, To the quiet of the skies, To the Sabbath of our God. Come to the sunset tree! The day is past and gone The woodman's axe lies free, And the reaper's work is done THE MEMORY OF THE DEAD. Forget them not:—though now their name Be but a mournful sound, Though by the hearth its utterance claim A stillness round. Though for their sake this earth no more As it hath been may be, And shadows, never mark'd before, Brood o'er each tree; And though their image dim the sky, Yet, yet forget them not! Nor, where their love and life went by, Forsake the spot! They have a breathing influence there, A charm, not elsewhere found; Sad—yet it sanctifies the air, The stream—the ground. Then, though the wind an alter'd tone Through the young foliage bear, Though every flower, of something gone A tinge may wear; Oh! fly it not!—no fruitless grief Thus in their presence felt, A record links to every leaf There, where they dwelt. Still trace the path which knew their tread, Still tend their garden-bower. Still commune with the holy dead In each lone hour! The holy dead!—oh! bless'd we are, That we may call them so, And to their image look afar, Through all our woe! Bless'd, that the things they loved on earth, As relics we may hold, That wake sweet thoughts of parted worth, By springs untold! Bless'd, that a deep and chastening power Thus o'er our souls is given, If but to bird, or song, or flower, Yet all for Heaven! HE WALK'D WITH GOD. (Genesis v. 24.) He walk'd with God, in holy joy, While yet his days were few; The deep glad spirit of the boy To love and reverence grew. Whether, each nightly star to count, The ancient hills he trode, Or sought the flowers by stream and fount— Alike he walk'd with God. The graver noon of manhood came, The full of cares and fears; One voice was in his heart—the same It heard through childhood's years. Amidst fair tents, and flocks, and swains, O'er his green pasture-sod, A shepherd king on eastern plains— The patriarch walk'd with God. And calmly, brightly, that pure life Melted from earth away; No cloud it knew, no parting strife, No sorrowful decay; He bow'd him not, like all beside, Unto the spoiler's rod, But join'd at once the glorified, Where angels walk with God! So let us walk!—the night must come To us that comes to all; We through the darkness must go home, Hearing the trumpet's call. Closed is the path for evermore, Which without death he trod; Not so that way, wherein of yore His footsteps walk'd with God! THE ROD OF AARON. (Numbers xvii. 8.) Was it the sigh of the southern gale That flush'd the almond bough? Brightest and first the young Spring to hail, Still its red blossoms glow. Was it the sunshine that woke its flowers With a kindling look of love? Oh, far and deep, and through hidden bowers, That smile of heaven can rove! No! from the breeze and the living light Shut was the sapless rod; But it felt in the stillness a secret might, And thrill'd to the breath of God. E'en so may that breath, like the vernal air, O'er our glad spirits move; And all such things as are good and fair, Be the blossoms, its track that prove! THE VOICE OF GOD. “I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid.”—Gen. iii. 10. Amidst the thrilling leaves, thy voice At evening's fall drew near; Father! and did not man rejoice That blessed sound to hear? Did not his heart within him burn, Touch'd by the solemn tone? Not so!—for, never to return, Its purity was gone. Therefore, 'midst holy stream and bower, His spirit shook with dread, And call'd the cedars, in that hour, To veil his conscious head. Oh! in each wind, each fountain flow, Each whisper of the shade, Grant me, my God, thy voice to know, And not to be afraid! THE FOUNTAIN OF MARAH. “And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter. “And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? “And he eried unto the Lord, and the Lord showed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet.” —Exodus, xv. 23—25. Where is the tree the prophet threw Into the bitter wave? Left it no scion where it grew, The thirsting soul to save? Hath nature lost the hidden power Its precious foliage shed? Is there no distant eastern bower With such sweet leaves o'erspread? Nay, wherefore ask?—since gifts are ours Which yet may well imbue Earth's many troubled founts with showers Of heaven's own balmy dew. Oh! mingled with the cup of grief Let faith's deep spirit be! And every prayer shall win a leaf From that bless'd healing tree! THE PENITENT'S OFFERING. (St Luke, vii. 37, 38.) Thou that with pallid cheek, And eyes in sadness meek, And faded locks that humbly swept the ground, From thy long wanderings won, Before the all-healing Son, Did'st bow thee to the earth, oh, lost and found! When thou would'st bathe his feet With odours richly sweet, And many a shower of woman's burning tear, And dry them with that hair, Brought low the dust to wear, From the crown'd beauty of its festal year. Did he reject thee then, While the sharp scorn of men On thy once bright and stately head was cast? No, from the Saviour's mien, A solemn light serene, Bore to thy soul the peace of God at last. For thee, their smiles no more Familiar faces wore; Voices, once kind, had learn'd the stranger's tone: Who raised thee up, and bound Thy silent spirit's wound?— He, from all guilt the stainless, He alone! But which, oh, erring child! From home so long beguiled, Which of thine offerings won those words of Heaven, That o'er the bruised reed, Condemn'd of earth to bleed, In music pass'd, “Thy sins are all forgiven?” Was it that perfume fraught With balm and incense brought, From the sweet woods of Araby the bless'd? Or that fast flowing rain, Of tears, which, not in vain To Him who scorn'd not tears, thy woes confess'd? No, not by these restored Unto thy Father's board, Thy peace, that kindled joy in Heaven, was made; But costlier in his eyes, By that bless'd sacrifice, Thy heart, thy full-deep heart, before Him laid. THE SCULPTURED CHILDREN, ON CHANTREY'S MONUMENT IN LICHFIELD CATHEDRAL. Fair images of sleep, Hallow'd, and soft, and deep, On whose calm lids the dreamy quiet lies, Like moonlight on shut bells Of flowers, in mossy dells, Fill'd with the hush of night and summer skies! How many hearts have felt Your silent beauty melt Their strength to gushing tenderness away! How many sudden tears, From depths of buried years All freshly bursting, have confess'd your sway! How many eyes will shed Still, o'er your marble bed, Such drops from memory's troubled fountains wrung— While hope hath blights to bear, While love breathes mortal air, While roses perish ere to glory sprung! Yet from a voiceless home, If some sad mother come, Fondly to linger o'er your lovely rest, As o'er the cheek's warm glow, And the sweet breathings low, Of babes that grew and faded on her breast; If then the dove-like tone Of those faint murmurs gone, O'er her sick sense too piercingly return; If for the soft bright hair, And brow and bosom fair, And life, now dust, her soul too deeply yearn; O gentle forms, entwined Like tendrils, which the wind May wave, so clasp'd, but never can unlink! Send from your calm profound A still small voice—a sound Of hope, forbidding that lone heart to sink! By all the pure meek mind In your pale beauty shrined, By childhood's love—too bright a bloom to die! O'er her worn spirit shed, O fairest, holiest dead! The faith, trust, joy, of immortality! WOMAN AND FAME. Thou hast a charmed cup, O Fame! A draught that mantles high, And seems to lift this earthly frame Above mortality. Away! to me—a woman—bring Sweet waters from affection's spring. Thou hast green laurel leaves, that twine Into so proud a wreath; For that resplendent gift of thine, Heroes have smiled in death: Give me from some kind hand a flower, The record of one happy hour! Thou hast a voice, whose thrilling tone Can bid each life-pulse beat As when a trumpet's note hath blown, Calling the brave to meet: But mine, let mine—a woman's breast, By words of home-born love be bless'd. A hollow sound is in thy song, A mockery in thine eye, To the sick heart that doth but long For aid, for sympathy— For kindly looks to cheer it on, For tender accents that are gone. Fame, Fame! thou canst not be the stay Unto the drooping reed, The cool fresh fountain in the day Of the soul's feverish need: Where must the lone one turn or flee?— Not unto thee—oh! not to thee! A THOUGHT OF THE FUTURE. Dreamer! and would'st thou know If love goes with us to the viewless bourne? Would'st thou bear hence th' unfathom'd source of woe In thy heart's lonely urn? What hath it been to thee, That power, the dweller of thy secret breast? A dove sent forth across a stormy sea, Finding no place of rest: A precious odour cast On a wild stream, that recklessly swept by; A voice of music utter'd to the blast, And winning no reply. Even were such answer thine— Would'st thou be bless'd?—too sleepless, too profound, Are the soul's hidden springs; there is no line Their depth of love to sound. Do not words faint and fail When thou would'st fill them with that ocean's power? As thine own cheek, before high thoughts grows pale In some o'erwhelming hour. Doth not thy frail form sink Beneath the chain that binds thee to one spot, When thy heart strives, held down by many a link, Where thy beloved are not? Is not thy very soul Oft in the gush of powerless blessing shed, Till a vain tenderness, beyond control, Bows down thy weary head? And would'st thou bear all this— The burden and the shadow of thy life— To trouble the blue skies of cloudless bliss With earthly feelings' strife? Not thus, not thus—oh, no! Not veil'd and mantled with dim clouds of care, That spirit of my soul should with me go To breathe celestial air. But as the skylark springs To its own sphere, where night afar is driven, As to its place the flower-seed findeth wings, So must love mount to heaven! Vainly it shall not strive There on weak words to pour a stream of fire; Thought unto thought shall kindling impulse give, As light might wake a lyre. And oh! its blessings there, Shower'd like rich balsam forth on some dear head, Powerless no more, a gift shall surely bear, A joy of sunlight shed. Let me, then—let me dream That love goes with us to the shore unknown; So o'er its burning tears a heavenly gleam In mercy shall be thrown! THE VOICE OF MUSIC. “Striking the electric chain wherewith we are darkly bound.” Childe Harold. Whence is the might of thy master-spell? Speak to me, voice of sweet sound, and tell! How canst thou wake, by one gentle breath, Passionate visions of love and death! How call'st thou back, with a note, a sigh, Words and low tones from the days gone by— A sunny glance, or a fond farewell?— Speak to me, voice of sweet sound, and tell! What is thy power, from the soul's deep spring In sudden gushes the tears to bring? Even 'midst the swells of thy festal glee, Fountains of sorrow are stirr'd by thee! Vain are those tears!—vain and fruitless all— Showers that refresh not, yet still must fall; For a purer bliss while the full heart burns, For a brighter home while the spirit yearns! Something of mystery there surely dwells, Waiting thy touch, in our bosom-cells; Something that finds not its answer here— A chain to be clasp'd in another sphere. Therefore a current of sadness deep, Through the stream of thy triumphs is heard to sweep, Like a moan of the breeze through a summer sky— Like a name of the dead when the wine foams high! Yet speak to me still, though thy tones be fraught With vain remembrance and troubled thought; Speak! for thou tellest my soul that its birth Links it with regions more bright than earth. THE ANGEL'S GREETING. “Hark!—they whisper!—Angels say, Sister spirit, come away.” Pope. Come to the land of peace! Come where the tempest hath no longer sway, The shadow passes from the soul away— The sounds of weeping cease. Fear hath no dwelling there! Come to the mingling of repose and love, Breathed by the silent spirit of the dove Through the celestial air. Come to the bright, and blest, And crown'd for ever! 'midst that shining band, Gather'd to Heaven's own wreath from every land, Thy spirit shall find rest! Thou hast been long alone: Come to thy mother!—on the Sabbath shore, The heart that rock'd thy childhood, back once more Shall take its wearied one. In silence wert thou left: Come to thy sisters!—joyously again All the home-voices, blent in one sweet strain, Shall greet their long bereft. Over thine orphan head The storm hath swept, as o'er a willow's bough: Come to thy Father!—it is finish'd now; Thy tears have all been shed. In thy divine abode, Change finds no pathway, memory no dark trace, And, oh! bright victory—death by love no place: Come, spirit, to thy God! A FAREWELL TO WALES. FOR THE MELODY CALLED “THE ASH GROVE,” ON LEAVING THAT COUNTRY WITH MY CHILDREN. The sound of thy streams in my spirit I bear— Farewell! and a blessing be with thee, green land! On thy hearths, on thy halls, on thy pure mountain-air, On the chords of the harp, and the minstrel's free hand! From the love of my soul with my tears it is shed, As I leave thee, green land of my home and my dead! I bless thee!—yet not for the beauty which dwells In the heart of thy hills, on the rocks of thy shore; And not for the memory set deep in thy dells, Of the bard and the hero, the mighty of yore; And not for thy songs of those proud ages fled, —Green land, poet land of my home and my dead! I bless thee for all the true bosoms that beat, Where'er a low hamlet smiles up to thy skies; For thy cottage hearths burning the stranger to greet, For the soul that shines forth from thy children's kind eyes! May the blessing, like sunshine, about thee be spread, Green land of my childhood, my home, and my dead! IMPROMPTU LINES, ADDRESSED TO MISS F. A. L., ON RECEIVING FROM HER SOME FLOWERS WHEN CONFINED BY ILLNESS. Ye tell me not of birds and bees, Not of the Summer's murmuring trees, Not of the streams and woodland bowers:— A sweeter tale is yours, fair flowers! Glad tidings to my couch ye bring, Of one still bright, still flowing spring— A fount of kindness ever new, In a friend's heart, the good and true. A PARTING SONG. “Oh! mes Amis, rappellez vous quelquefois mes vers; mon ame y est empreinte.”— Corinne. When will ye think of me, my friends? When will ye think of me?— When the last red light, the farewell of day, From the rock and the river is passing away— When the air with a deep'ning hush is fraught, And the heart grows burden'd with tender thought— Then let it be! When will ye think of me, kind friends? When will ye think of me?— When the rose of the rich midsummer time Is fill'd with the hues of its glorious prime— When ye gather its bloom, as in bright hours fled, From the walks where my footsteps no more may tread— Then let it be! When will ye think of me, sweet friends? When will ye think of me?— When the sudden tears o'erflow your eye At the sound of some olden melody— When ye hear the voice of a mountain stream, When ye feel the charm of a poet's dream— Then let it be! Thus let my memory be with you, friends! Thus ever think of me! Kindly and gently, but as of one For whom 'tis well to be fled and gone— As of a bird from a chain unbound, As of a wanderer whose home is found— So let it be. WE RETURN NO MORE! Ha til!—ha til!—ha til mi tulidle!—“we return!— we return!—we return no more!”—the burden of the Highland song of emigration. “When I stood beneath the fresh green tree, And saw around me the wide field revive With fruits and fertile promise; and the Spring Come forth, her work of gladness to contrive, With all her reckless birds upon the wing I turn'd from all she brought to all she could not bring.” Childe Harold. “We return!—we return!—we return no more!” So comes the song to the mountain-shore, From those that are leaving their Highland home, For a world far over the blue sea's foam: “We return no more!” and through cave and dell Mournfully wanders that wild farewell. “We return!—we return!—we return no more!” So breathe sad voices our spirits o'er: Murmuring up from the depths of the heart, Where lovely things with their light depart: And the inborn sound hath a prophet's tone, And we feel that a joy is for ever gone. “We return!—we return!—we return no more!” Is it heard when the days of flowers are o'er? When the passionate soul of the night-bird's lay Hath died from the summer woods away? When the glory from sunset's robe hath pass'd, Or the leaves are borne on the rushing blast? No!—it is not the rose that returns no more; A breath of spring shall its bloom restore; And it is not the voice that o'erflows the bowers, With a stream of love through the starry hours; Nor is it the crimson of sunset hues, Nor the frail flush'd leaves which the wild wind strews. “We return!—we return!—we return no more!” Doth the bird sing thus from a brighter shore? Those wings that follow the southern breeze, Float they not homeward o'er vernal seas? Yes! from the lands of the vine and palm They come, with the sunshine, when waves grow calm. “But we!—we return!—we return no more!” The heart's young dreams, when their spring is o'er; The love it hath pour'd so freely forth— The boundless trust in ideal worth; The faith in affection—deep, fond, yet vain— These are the lost that return not again! TO A WANDERING FEMALE SINGER. Thou hast loved and thou hast suffer'd! Unto feeling deep and strong, Thou hast trembled like a harp's frail string— I know it by thy song! Thou hast loved—it may be vainly— But well—oh! but too well— Thou hast suffer'd all that woman's breast May bear—but must not tell. Thou hast wept and thou hast parted, Thou hast been forsaken long, Thou hast watch'd for steps that came not back— I know it by thy song! By the low clear silvery gushing Of its music from thy breast, By the quivering of its flute-like swell— A sound of the heart's unrest. By its fond and plaintive lingering, On each word of grief so long, Oh! thou hast loved and suffer'd much— I know it by thy song! THE PALMER. “The faded palm branch in his hand, Show'd pilgrim from the Holy Land.” Scott. Art thou come from the far-off land at last? Thou that hast wander'd long! Thou art come to a home whence the smile hath pass'd With the merry voice of song. For the sunny glance and the bounding heart Thou wilt seek—but all are gone; They are parted e'en as waters part, To meet in the deep alone! And thou—from thy lip is fled the glow, From thine eye the light of morn; And the shades of thought o'erhang thy brow, And thy cheek with life is worn. Say what hast thou brought from the distant shore For thy wasted youth to pay? Hast thou treasure to win thee joys once more? Hast thou vassals to smooth thy way? “I have brought but the palm-branch in my hand, Yet I call not my bright youth lost! I have won but high thought in the Holy Land, Yet I count not too dear the cost! “I look on the leaves of the deathless tree— These records of my track; And better than youth in its flush of glee, Are the memories they give me back! “They speak of toil, and of high emprise, As in words of solemn cheer, They speak of lonely victories O'er pain, and doubt, and fear. “They speak of scenes which have now become Bright pictures in my breast; Where my spirit finds a glorious home, And the love of my heart can rest. “The colours pass not from these away, Like tints of shower or sun; Oh! beyond all treasures that know decay, Is the wealth my soul hath won! “A rich light thence o'er my life's decline, An inborn light is cast; For the sake of the palm from the holy shrine, I bewail not my bright days past! THE CHILD'S FIRST GRIEF. “Oh! call my brother back to me! I cannot play alone; The Summer comes with flower and bee— Where is my brother gone? “The butterfly is glancing bright Across the sunbeam's track; I care not now to chase its flight— Oh! call my brother back! “The flowers run wild—the flowers we sow'd Around our garden tree; Our vine is drooping with its load— Oh! call him back to me!” “He would not hear thy voice, fair child, He may not come to thee; The face that once like Spring-time smiled, On earth no more thou'lt see. “A rose's brief bright life of joy, Such unto him was given; Go—thou must play alone, my boy! Thy brother is in heaven.” “And has he left his birds and flowers; And must I call in vain? And through the long, long summer hours, Will he not come again? “And by the brook and in the glade Are all our wanderings o'er? Oh! while my brother with me play'd, Would I had loved him more!” TO THE NEW-BORN. Addressed to the child of her eldest brother. A blessing on thy head, thou child of many hopes and fears! A rainbow-welcome thine hath been, of mingled smiles and tears. Thy father greets thee unto life, with a full and chasten'd heart, For a solemn gift from God thou com'st, all precious as thou art! I see thee not asleep, fair boy, upon thy mother's breast, Yet well I know how guarded there shall be thy rosy rest; And how her soul with love, and prayer, and gladness, will o'erflow, While bending o'er thy soft-seal'd eyes, thou dear one, well I know! A blessing on thy gentle head! and bless'd thou art in truth, For a home where God is felt, awaits thy childhood and thy youth: Around thee pure and holy thoughts shall dwell as light and air, And steal unto thine heart, and wake the germs now folded there. Smile on thy mother! while she feels that unto her is given, In that young day-spring glance the pledge of a soul to rear for heaven! Smile! and sweet peace be o'er thy sleep, joy o'er thy wakening shed! Blessings and blessings evermore, fair boy! upon thy head! THE DEATH-SONG OF ALCESTIS. She came forth in her bridal robes array'd, And 'midst the graceful statues, round the hall Shedding the calm of their celestial mein, Stood pale yet proudly beautiful, as they: Flowers in her bosom, and the star-like gleam Of jewels trembling from her braided hair, And death upon her brow!—but glorious death! Her own heart's choice, the token and the seal Of love, o'ermastering love; which, till that hour, Almost an anguish in the brooding weight Of its unutterable tenderness, Had burden'd her full soul. But now, oh! now, Its time was come—and from the spirit's depths, The passion and the mighty melody Of its immortal voice, in triumph broke, Like a strong rushing wind! The soft pure air Came floating through that hall—the Grecian air, Laden with music—flute-notes from the vales, Echoes of song—the last sweet sounds of life And the glad sunshine of the golden clime Stream'd, as a royal mantle, round her form— The glorified of love! But she—she look'd Only on him for whom 'twas joy to die, Deep—deepest, holiest joy!—or if a thought Of the warm sunlight, and the scented breeze, And the sweet Dorian songs, o'erswept the tide Of her unswerving soul—'twas but a thought That own'd the summer loveliness of life For him a worthy offering!—So she stood, Wrapt in bright silence, as entranced awhile, Till her eye kindled, and her quivering frame With the swift breeze of inspiration shook, As the pale priestess trembles to the breath Of inborn oracles!—then flush'd her cheek, And all the triumph, all the agony, Borne on the battling waves of love and death, All from her woman's heart, in sudden song, Burst like a fount of fire. “I go, I go! Thou sun, thou golden sun, I go Far from thy light to dwell: Thou shalt not find my place below, Dim is that world—bright sun of Greece, farewell! “The laurel and the glorious rose Thy glad beam yet may see, But where no purple summer glows, O'er the dark wave I haste from them and thee. “Yet doth my spirit faint to part? —I mourn thee not, O sun! Joy, solemn joy, o'erflows my heart, Sing me triumphal songs!—my crown is won! “Let not a voice of weeping rise— My heart is girt with power! Let the green earth and festal skies Laugh, as to grace a conqueror's closing hour! “For thee, for thee, my bosom's lord! Thee, my soul's loved! I die; Thine is the torch of life restored, Mine, mine the rapture, mine the victory! “Now may the boundless love, that lay Unfathom'd still before, In one consuming burst find way, In one bright flood all, all its riches pour! “Thou know'st, thou know'st what love is now! Its glory and its might— Are they not written on my brow? And will that image ever quit thy sight? “No! deathless in thy faithful breast, There shall my memory keep Its own bright altar-place of rest, While o'er my grave the cypress branches weep. “Oh, the glad light!—the light is fair, The soft breeze warm and free; And rich notes fill the scented air, And all are gifts—my love's last gifts to thee! “Take me to thy warm heart once more! Night falls—my pulse beats low: Seek not to quicken, to restore— Joy is in every pang—I go, I go! “I feel thy tears, I feel thy breath, I meet thy fond look still; Keen is the strife of love and death; Faint and yet fainter grows my bosom's thrill. “Yet swells the tide of rapture strong, Though mists o'ershade mine eye! —Sing, Pæan! sing a conqueror's song! For thee, for thee, my spirit's lord, I die!” THE HOME OF LOVE. Thou mov'st in visions, love!—Around thy way, E'en through this world's rough path and changeful day, For ever floats a gleam, Not from the realms of moonlight or the morn, But thine own soul's illumined chambers born— The colouring of a dream! Love, shall I read thy dream?—oh! is it not All of some sheltering, wood-embosomed spot— A bower for thee and thine? Yes! lone and lowly is that home; yet there Something of heaven in the transparent air Makes every flower divine. Something that mellows and that glorifies, Breathes o'er it ever from the tender skies, As o'er some blessed isle; E'en like the soft and spiritual glow, Kindling rich woods, whereon th' ethereal bow Sleeps lovingly awhile. The very whispers of the wind have there A flute-like harmony, that seems to bear Greeting from some bright shore, Where none have said farewell!—where no decay Lends the faint crimson to the dying day; Where the storm's might is o'er. And there thou dreamest of Elysian rest, In the deep sanctuary of one true breast Hidden from earthly ill: There would'st thou watch the homeward step, whose sound Wakening all nature to sweet echoes round, Thine inmost soul can thrill. There by the hearth should many a glorious page, From mind to mind the immortal heritage, For thee its treasures pour; Or music's voice at vesper hours be heard, Or dearer interchange of playful word, Affection's household lore. And the rich unison of mingled prayer, The melody of hearts in heavenly air, Thence duly should arise; Lifting th' eternal hope, th' adoring breath, Of spirits, not to be disjoin'd by death, Up to the starry skies. There, dost thou well believe, no storm should come To mar the stillness of that angel-home; There should thy slumbers be Weigh'd down with honey-dew, serenely bless'd, Like theirs who first in Eden's grove took rest Under some balmy tree. Love, Love! thou passionate in joy and woe! And canst thou hope for cloudless peace below— Here, where bright things must die? O thou! that wildly worshipping, dost shed On the frail altar of a mortal head Gifts of infinity! Thou must be still a trembler, fearful Love! Danger seems gathering from beneath, above, Still round thy precious things; Thy stately pine-tree, or thy gracious rose, In their sweet shade can yield thee no repose, Here, where the blight hath wings. And as a flower, with some fine sense imbued, To shrink before the wind's vicissitude, So in thy prescient breast Are lyre-strings quivering with prophetic thrill To the low footstep of each coming ill; —Oh! canst thou dream of rest? Bear up thy dream! thou mighty and thou weak! Heart, strong as death, yet as a reed to break— As a flame, tempest-sway'd! He that sits calm on high is yet the source Whence thy soul's current hath its troubled course, He that great deep hath made! Will he not pity?—He whose searching eye Reads all the secrets of thine agony?— Oh! pray to be forgiven Thy fond idolatry, thy blind excess, And seek with Him that bower of blessedness— Love! thy sole home is heaven! BOOKS AND FLOWERS. “La vue d'une fleur caresse mon imagination, et flatte mes sens à un point inexprimable. Sous le tranquille abri du toit paternel j'etais nourrie des l'enfance avec des fleurs et des livres;—dans l'etroite enceinte d'une prison, au milieu des fers imposies par la tyrannie, j'oublie l'injustice des hommes. leurs sottises et mes maux avec des livres et des fleurs.” Madame Roland. Come, let me make a sunny realm around thee, Of thought and beauty! Here are books and flowers, With spells to loose the fetter which hath bound thee— The ravell'd coil of this world's feverish hours. The soul of song is in these deathless pages, Even as the odour in the flower enshrined; Here the crown'd spirits of departed ages Have left the silent melodies of mind. Their thoughts, that strove with time, and change, and anguish, For some high place where faith her wing might rest, Are burning here—a flame that may not languish— Still pointing upward to that bright hill's crest! Their grief, the veil'd infinity exploring For treasures lost, is here;—their boundless love Its mighty streams of gentleness outpouring On all things round, and clasping all above. And the bright beings, their own heart's creations, Bright, yet all human, here are breathing still; Conflicts, and agonies, and exultations Are here, and victories of prevailing will! Listen, oh, listen! let their high words cheer thee! Their swan-like music ringing through all woes; Let my voice bring their holy influence near thee— The Elysian air of their divine repose! Or would'st thou turn to earth? Not earth all furrow'd By the old traces of man's toil and care, But the green peaceful world that never sorrow'd, The world of leaves, and dews, and summer air! Look on these flowers! As o'er an altar shedding, O'er Milton's page, soft light from colour'd urns! They are the links, man's heart to nature wedding, When to her breast the prodigal returns. They are from lone wild places, forest dingles, Fresh banks of many a low-voiced hidden stream, Where the sweet star of eve looks down and mingles Faint lustre with the water-lily's gleam. They are from where the soft winds play in gladness, Covering the turf with flowery blossom-showers; —Too richly dower'd, O friend! are we for sadness— Look on an empire—mind and nature—ours! FOR A PICTURE OF ST CECILIA ATTENDED BY ANGELS. “How rich that forehead's calm expanse! How bright that heaven-directed glance! —Waft her to glory, winged powers, Ere sorrow be renew'd, And intercourse with mortal hours Bring back a humbler mood!” Wordsworth. How can that eye, with inspiration beaming, Wear yet so deep a calm?—Oh, child of song! Is not the music-land a world of dreaming, Where forms of sad, bewildering beauty throng? Hath it not sounds from voices long departed? Echoes of tones that rung in childhood's ear? Low haunting whispers, which the weary-hearted, Stealing 'midst crowds away, have wept to hear? No, not to thee!—thy spirit, meek, yet queenly, On its own starry height, beyond all this, Floating triumphantly and yet serenely, Breathes no faint under-tone through songs of bliss. Say by what strain, through cloudless ether swelling, Thou hast drawn down those wanderers from the skies? Bright guests! even such as left of yore their dwelling, For the deep cedar shades of Paradise! What strain?—oh! not the nightingale's when showering Her own heart's life drops on the burning lay, She stirs the young woods in the days of flowering, And pours her strength, but not her grief away: And not the exile's—when, 'midst lonely billows, He wakes the alpine notes his mother sung, Or blends them with the sigh of alien willows, Where, murmuring to the wind, his harp is hung: And not the pilgrim's—though his thoughts be holy, And sweet his ave song, when day grows dim; Yet, as he journeys, pensively and slowly, Something of sadness floats through that low hymn. But thou!—the spirit which at eve is filling All the hush'd air and reverential sky, Founts, leaves, and flowers, with solemn rapture thrilling, This is the soul of thy rich harmony. This bears up high those breathings of devotion Wherein the currents of thy heart gush free; Therefore no world of sad and vain emotion Is the dream-haunted music-land for thee. THE BRIGAND LEADER AND HIS WIFE. SUGGESTED BY A PICTURE OF EASTLAKE'S. Dark chieftain of the heath and height! Wild feaster on the hills by night! See'st thou the stormy sunset's glow Flung back by glancing spears below? Now for one strife of stern despair! The foe hath track'd thee to thy lair. Thou, against whom the voice of blood Hath risen from rock and lonely wood; And in whose dreams a moan should be, Not of the water, nor the tree; Haply thine own last hour is nigh,— Yet shalt thou not forsaken die. There's one that pale beside thee stands, More true than all thy mountain bands! She will not shrink in doubt and dread, When the balls whistle round thy head: Nor leave thee, though thy closing eye No longer may to her's reply. Oh! many a soft and quiet grace Hath faded from her form and face; And many a thought, the fitting guest Of woman's meek religious breast, Hath perish'd in her wanderings wide, Through the deep forests by thy side. Yet, mournfully surviving all, A flower upon a ruin's wall, A friendless thing, whose lot is cast Of lovely ones to be the last; Sad, but unchanged through good and ill, Thine is her lone devotion still. And oh! not wholly lost the heart Where that undying love hath part; Not worthless all, though far and long From home estranged, and guided wrong; Yet may its depths by Heaven be stirr'd, Its prayer for thee be pour'd and heard! THE CHILD'S RETURN FROM THE WOODLANDS. SUGGESTED BY A PICTURE OF SIR THOMAS LAWRENCE'S. “All good and guiltless as thou art, Some transient griefs will touch thy heart— Griefs that along thy alter'd face Will breathe a more subduing grace, Than even those looks of joy that lie On the soft cheek of infancy.” Wilson. Hast thou been in the woods with the honey-bee? Hast thou been with the lamb in the pastures free? With the hare through the copses and dingles wild? With the butterfly over the heath, fair child? Yes: the light fall of thy bounding feet Hath not startled the wren from her mossy seat: Yet hast thou ranged the green forest-dells And brought back a treasure of buds and bells. Thou know'st not the sweetness, by antique song Breathed o'er the names of that flowery throng; The woodbine, the primrose, the violet dim, The lily that gleams by the fountain's brim; These are old words, that have made each grove A dreaming haunt for romance and love— Each sunny bank, where faint odours lie, A place for the gushings of poesy. Thou know'st not the light wherewith fairy lore Sprinkles the turf and the daisies o'er; Enough for thee are the dews that sleep, Like hidden gems, in the flower-urns deep; Enough the rich crimson spots that dwell 'Midst the gold of the cowslip's perfumed cell; And the scent by the blossoming sweetbriers shed, And the beauty that bows the wood-hyacinth's head. Oh! happy child, in thy fawn-like glee, What is remembrance or thought to thee? Fill thy bright locks with those gifts of spring, O'er thy green pathway their colours fling; Bind them in chaplet and wild festoon— What if to droop and to perish soon? Nature hath mines of such wealth—and thou Never wilt prize its delights as now! For a day is coming to quell the tone That rings in thy laughter, thou joyous one! And to dim thy brow with a touch of care, Under the gloss of its clustering hair; And to tame the flash of thy cloudless eyes Into the stillness of autumn skies; And to teach thee that grief hath her needful part, 'Midst the hidden things of each human heart. Yet shall we mourn, gentle child! for this? Life hath enough of yet holier bliss! Such be thy portion!—the bliss to look, With a reverent spirit, through nature's book; By fount, by forest, by river's line, To track the paths of a love divine; To read its deep meanings—to see and hear God in earth's garden—and not to fear! THE FAITH OF LOVE. Thou hast watch'd beside the bed of death, Oh, fearless human Love! Thy lip received the last faint breath, Ere the spirit fled above. Thy prayer was heard by the parting bier, In a low and farewell tone, Thou hast given the grave both flower and tear— —Oh, Love! thy task is done. Then turn thee from each pleasant spot Where thou wert wont to rove, For there the friend of thy soul is not, Nor the joy of thy youth, oh, Love! Thou wilt meet but mournful memory there, Her dreams in the grove she weaves, With echoes filling the summer air, With sighs the trembling leaves. Then turn thee to the world again, From those dim haunted bowers, And shut thine ear to the wild sweet strain That tells of vanish'd hours. And wear not on thine aching heart The image of the dead, For the tie is rent that gave thee part In the gladness its beauty shed. And gaze on the pictured smile no more That thus can life outlast: All between parted souls is o'er;— —Love! Love! forget the past! “Voice of vain boding! away, be still! Strive not against the faith That yet my bosom with light can fill, Unquench'd, and undimm'd by death: “From the pictured smile I will not turn, Though sadly now it shine; Nor quit the shades that in whispers mourn For the step once link'd with mine: “Nor shut mine ear to the song of old, Though its notes the pang renew, —Such memories deep in my heart I hold, To keep it pure and true. “By the holy instinct of my heart, By the hope that bears me on, I have still my own undying part In the deep affection gone. “By the presence that about me seems Through night and day to dwell, Voice of vain bodings and fearful dreams! —I have breathed no last farewell!” THE SISTER'S DREAM. She sleeps!—but not the free and sunny sleep That lightly on the brow of childhood lies: Though happy be her rest, and soft, and deep, Yet, ere it sunk upon her shadow'd eyes, Thoughts of past scenes and kindred graves o'erswept Her soul's meek stillness—she had pray'd and wept. And now in visions to her couch they come, The early lost—the beautiful—the dead— That unto her bequeath'd a mournful home, Whence with their voices all sweet laughter fled; They rise—the sisters of her youth arise, As from the world where no frail blossom dies. And well the sleeper knows them not of earth— Not as they were when binding up the flowers, Telling wild legends round the winter-hearth, Braiding their long fair hair for festal hours; These things are past—a spiritual gleam, A solemn glory, robes them in that dream. Yet, if the glee of life's fresh budding years In those pure aspects may no more be read, Thence, too, hath sorrow melted—and the tears Which o'er their mother's holy dust they shed, Are all effaced; there earth hath left no sign Save its deep love, still touching every line. But, oh! more soft, more tender, breathing more A thought of pity, than in vanish'd days: While, hovering silently and brightly o'er The lone one's head, they meet her spirit's gaze With their immortal eyes, that seem to say, “Yet, sister, yet we love thee—come away!” 'Twill fade, the radiant dream! and will she not Wake with more painful yearning at her heart? Will not her home seem yet a lonelier spot, Her task more sad, when those bright shadows part? And the green summer after them look dim, And sorrow's tone be in the bird's wild hymn? But let her hope be strong, and let the dead Visit her soul in heaven's calm beauty still, Be their names utter'd, be their memory spread Yet round the place they never more may fill! All is not over with earth's broken tie— Where, where should sisters love, if not on high? A FAREWELL TO ABBOTSFORD. Home of the gifted! fare thee well, And a blessing on thee rest; While the heather waves its purple bell O'er moor and mountain crest; While stream to stream around thee calls, And braes with broom are drest, Glad be the harping in thy halls— A blessing on thee rest! While the high voice from thee sent forth Bids rock and cairn reply, Wakening the spirits of the North, Like a chieftain's gathering cry; While its deep master-tones hold sway As a king's o'er every breast, Home of the Legend and the Lay! A blessing on thee rest! Joy to thy hearth, and board, and bower! Long honours to thy line! And hearts of proof, and hands of power, And bright names worthy thine! By the merry step of childhood, still May thy free sward be prest! —While one proud pulse in the land can thrill, A blessing on thee rest! O'CONNOR'S CHILD. “I fled the home of grief At Connocht Moran's tomb to fall, I found the helmet of my chief, His bow still hanging on our wall; And took it down, and vow'd to rove This desert place a huntress bold: Nor would I change my buried love For any heart of living mould.” Campbell. The sleep of storms is dark upon the skies, The weight of omens heavy in the cloud:— Bid the lorn huntress of the desert rise, And gird the form whose beauty grief hath bow'd, And leave the tomb, as tombs are left—alone, To the star's vigil, and the wind's wild moan. Tell her of revelries in bower and hall, Where gems are glittering, and bright wine is pour'd; Where to glad measures chiming footsteps fall, And soul seems gushing from the harp's full chord; And richer flowers amid fair tresses wave, Than the sad “Love lies bleeding” of the grave. Oh! little know'st thou of the o'ermastering spell, Wherewith love binds the spirit strong in pain, To the spot hallow'd by a wild farewell, A parting agony,—intense, yet vain, A look—and darkness when its gleam hath flown, A voice—and silence when its words are gone! She hears thee not; her full, deep, fervent heart Is set in her dark eyes;—and they are bound Unto that cross, that shrine, that world apart, Where faithful blood hath sanctified the ground; And love with death striven long by tear and prayer, And anguish frozen into still despair. Yet on her spirit hath arisen at last A light, a joy, of its own wanderings born; Around her path a vision's glow is cast, Back, back her lost one comes in hues of morn! He comes, and makes her glad.”Campbell. For her the gulf is fill'd—the dark night fled, Whose mystery parts the living and the dead. And she can pour forth in such converse high, All her soul's tide of love, the deep, the strong, Oh! lonelier far, perchance, thy destiny, And more forlorn, amidst the world's gay throng, Than hers—the queen of that majestic gloom, The tempest, and the desert, and the tomb! THE PRAYER FOR LIFE. O sunshine and fair earth! Sweet is your kindly mirth, Angel of death! yet, yet awhile delay! Too sad it is to part, Thus in my spring of heart, With all the light and laughter of the day. For me the falling leaf Touches no chord of grief, No dark void in the rose's bosom lies: Not one triumphal tone, One hue of hope, is gone From song or bloom beneath the summer skies. Death, Death! ere yet decay, Call me not hence away, Over the golden hours no shade is thrown; The poesy that dwells Deep in green woods and dells, Still to my spirit speaks of joy alone. Yet not for this, O Death! Not for the vernal breath Of winds that shake forth music from the trees; Not for the splendour given To night's dark regal heaven, Spoiler! I ask thee not reprieve for these. But for the happy love Whose light, where'er I rove, Kindles all nature to a sudden smile, Shedding on branch and flower A rainbow-tinted shower Of richer life—spare, spare me yet awhile. Too soon, too fast thou'rt come! Too beautiful is home, A home of gentle voices and kind eyes! And I the loved of all, On whom fond blessings fall From every lip—oh! wilt thou rend such ties? Sweet sisters! weave a chain My spirit to detain; Hold me to earth with strong affection back: Bind me with mighty love Unto the stream, the grove, Our daily paths—our life's familiar track. Stay with me! gird me round! Your voices bear a sound Of hope—a light comes with you and departs; Hush, my soul's boding swell, That murmurs of sarewell; How can I leave this ring of kindest hearts? Death! grave!—and are there those That woo your dark repose 'Midst the rich beauty of the glowing earth. Surely about them lies No world of loving eyes— Leave me, oh! leave me unto home and hearth! THE WELCOME TO DEATH. Thou art welcome, O thou warning voice! My soul hath pined for thee; Thou art welcome as sweet sounds from shore To wanderer on the sea. I hear thee in the rustling woods, In the sighing vernal airs; Thou call'st me from the lonely earth, With a deeper tone than theirs. The lonely earth! Since kindred steps From its green paths are fled, A dimness and a hush have lain O'er all its beauty spread. The silence of the unanswering soul Is on me and around; My heart hath echoes but for thee, Thou still, small, warning sound! Voice after voice hath died away, Once in my dwelling heard; Sweet household-name by name hath changed To grief's forbidden word! From dreams of night on each I call, Each of the far removed; And waken to my own wild cry— “Where are ye, my beloved?” Ye left me! and earth's flowers were dim With records of the past: And stars pour'd down another light Than o'er my youth they cast: Birds will not sing as once they sung, When ye were at my side, And mournful tones are in the wind, Which I heard not till ye died! Thou art welcome, O thou summoner! Why should the last remain? What eye can reach my heart of hearts, Bearing in light again? E'en could this be, too much of fear O'er love would now be thrown— Away, away! from time, from change, Once more to meet my own! THE VICTOR. “De tout ce qui t'aimoit n'est-il plus rien qui t'aime?” Lamartine. Mighty ones, Love and Death! Ye are the strong in this world of ours, Ye meet at the banquets, ye dwell 'midst the flowers, —Which hath the conqueror's wreath? Thou art the victor, Love! Thou art the fearless, the crown'd, the free, The strength of the battle is given to thee, The spirit from above! Thou hast look'd on Death, and smiled! Thou hast borne up the reed-like and fragile form, Thro' the waves of the fight, thro' the rush of the storm, On field, and flood, and wild! No!—Thou art the victor, Death! Thou comest, and where is that which spoke, From the depths of the eye, when the spirit woke? —Gone with the fleeting breath! Thou comest—and what is left Of all that loved us, to say if aught Yet loves—yet answers the burning thought Of the spirit lone and reft? Silence is where thou art! Silently there must kindred meet, No smile to cheer, and no voice to greet, No bounding of heart to heart! Boast not thy victory, Death! It is but as the cloud's o'er the sunbeam's power, It is but as the winter's o'er leaf and flower, That slumber, the snow beneath. It is but as a tyrant's reign O'er the voice and the lip which he bids be still: But the fiery thought and the lofty will, Are not for him to chain! They shall soar his might above! And thus with the root whence affection springs, Though buried, it is not of mortal things— Thou art the victor, Love! LINES WRITTEN FOR THE ALBUM AT ROSANNA. A beautiful place in the county of Wicklow, formerly the abode of the authoress of “Psyche.” Oh! lightly tread through these deep chestnut-bowers Where a sweet spirit once in beauty moved! And touch with reverent hand these leaves and flowers, Fair things, which well a gentle heart hath loved! A gentle heart, of love and grief th' abode, Whence the bright stream of song in tear-drops flow'd. And bid its memory sanctify the scene! And let th' ideal presence of the dead Float round, and touch the woods with softer green, And o'er the streams a charm, like moonlight, shed; Through the soul's depths in holy silence felt— A spell to raise, to chasten, and to melt! THE VOICE OF THE WAVES. WRITTEN NEAR THE SCENE OF A RECENT SHIPWRECK. “How perfect was the calm! It seem'd no sleep, No mood, which season takes away or brings; I could have fancied that the mighty deep Was even the gentlest of all gentle things. But welcome fortitude and patient cheer, And frequent sights of what is to be borne.” Wordsworth. Answer, ye chiming waves! That now in sunshine sweep; Speak to me from thy hidden caves, Voice of the solemn deep! Hath man's lone spirit here With storms in battle striven? Where all is now so calmly clear, Hath anguish cried to heaven? —Then the sea's voice arose, Like an earthquake's under-tone: “Mortal, the strife of human woes Where hath not nature known? “Here to the quivering mast Despair hath wildly clung, The shriek upon the wind hath pass'd, The midnight sky hath rung. “And the youthful and the brave, With their beauty and renown, To the hollow chambers of the wave In darkness have gone down. “They are vanish'd from their place— Let their homes and hearths make moan! But the rolling waters keep no trace Of pang or conflict gone.” —Alas! thou haughty deep! The strong, the sounding far! My heart before thee dies,—I weep To think on what we are! To think that so we pass, High hope, and thought, and mind, Even as the breath-stain from the glass, Leaving no sign behind! Saw'st thou nought else, thou main? Thou and the midnight sky? Nought save the struggle, brief and vain, The parting agony! —And the sea's voice replied, “Here nobler things have been! Power with the valiant when they died, To sanctify the scene: “Courage, in fragile form, Faith trusting to the last, Prayer, breathing heavenwards thro' the storm, But all alike have pass'd.” Sound on, thou haughty sea! These have not pass'd in vain; My soul awakes, my hope springs free On victor wings again. Thou, from thine empire driven, May'st vanish with thy powers; But, by the hearts that here have striven, A loftier doom is ours! THE HAUNTED HOUSE. “I seem like one Who treads alone Some banquet hall deserted, Whose lights are fled, Whose garlands dead, And all but me departed.” Moore. See'st thou yon grey gleaming hall, Where the deep elm-shadows fall? Voices that have left the earth Long ago, Still are murmuring round its hearth, Soft and low: Ever there;—yet one alone Hath the gift to hear their tone. Guests come thither, and depart, Free of step, and light of heart; Children, with sweet visions bless'd, In the haunted chambers rest; One alone unslumbering lies When the night hath seal'd all eyes, One quick heart and watchful ear, Listening for those whispers clear. See'st thou where the woodbine flowers O'er yon low porch hang in showers? Startling faces of the dead, Pale, yet sweet, One lone woman's entering tread There still meet! Some with young smooth foreheads fair, Faintly shining through bright hair; Some with reverend locks of snow— All, all buried long ago! All, from under deep sea-waves, Or the flowers of foreign graves, Or the old and banner'd aisle, Where their high tombs gleam the while; Rising, wandering, floating by, Suddenly and silently, Through their earthly home and place, But amidst another race. Wherefore, unto one alone, Are those sounds and visions known? Wherefore hath that spell of power Dark and dread, On her soul, a baleful dower, Thus been shed? Oh! in those deep-seeing eyes, No strange gift of mystery lies! She is lone where once she moved, Fair, and happy, and beloved! Sunny smiles were glancing round her, Tendrils of kind hearts had bound her. Now those silver chords are broken, Those bright looks have left no token; Not one trace on all the earth, Save her memory of their mirth. She is lone and lingering now, Dreams have gather'd o'er her brow, 'Midst gay songs and children's play, She is dwelling far away Seeing what none else may see— Haunted still her place must be! THE SHEPHERD-POET OF THE ALPS. “God gave him reverence of laws, Yet stirring blood in freedom's cause— A spirit to his rocks akin, The eye of the hawk, and the fire therein!” Coleridge. Singing of the free blue sky, And the wild-flower glens that lie Far amidst the ancient hills, Which the fountain music fills; Singing of the snow-peaks bright, And the royal eagle's flight, And the courage and the grace Foster'd by the chamois-chase; In his fetters, day by day, So the Shepherd-poet lay, Wherefore, from a dungeon-cell Did those notes of freedom swell, Breathing sadness not their own, Forth with every Alpine tone? Wherefore!—can a tyrant's ear Brook the mountain-winds to hear, When each blast goes pealing by With a song of liberty? Darkly hung th' oppressor's hand O'er the Shepherd-poet's land; Sounding there the waters gush'd, While the lip of man was hush'd; There the falcon pierced the cloud, While the fiery heart was bow'd: But this might not long endure, Where the mountain-homes were pure; And a valiant voice arose, Thrilling all the silent snows; His—now singing far and lone, Where the young breeze ne'er was known; Singing of the glad blue sky, Wildly—and how mournfully! Are none but the Wind and the Lammer-Geyer To be free where the hills unto heaven aspire? Is the soul of song from the deep glens past, Now that their poet is chain'd at last?— Think of the mountains, and deem not so! Soon shall each blast like a clarion blow! Yes! though forbidden be every word Wherewith that spirit the Alps hath stirr'd, Yet even as a buried stream through earth Rolls on to another and brighter birth, So shall the voice that hath seem'd to die, Burst forth with the anthem of liberty! And another power is moving In a bosom fondly loving:— Oh; a sister's heart is deep, And her spirit strong to keep Each light link of early hours, All sweet scents of childhood's flowers! Thus each lay by Erni sung, Rocks and crystal caves among, Or beneath the linden-leaves, Or the cabin's vine-hung eaves, Rapid though as bird-notes gushing, Transient as a wan-cheek's flushing, Each in young Teresa's breast Left its fiery words impress'd; Treasured there lay every line, As a rich book on a hidden shrine. Fair was that lone girl, and meek, With a pale transparent cheek, And a deep-fringed violet eye Seeking in sweet shade to lie, Or, if raised to glance above, Dim with its own dews of love; And a pure, Madonna brow, And a silvery voice, and low, Like the echo of a flute, Even the last, ere all be mute. But a loftier soul was seen In the orphan sister's mien, From that hour when chains defiled Him, the high Alps' noble child. Tones in her quivering voice awoke, As if a harp of battle spoke; Light, that seem'd born of an eagle's nest, Flash'd from her soft eyes unrepress'd; And her form, like a spreading water-flower, When its frail cup swells with a sudden shower, Seem'd all dilated with love and pride, And grief for that brother, her young heart's guide. Well might they love!—those two had grown Orphans together and alone: The silence of the Alpine sky Had hush'd their hearts to piety; The turf, o'er their dead mother laid, Had been their altar when they pray'd; There, more in tenderness than woe, The stars had seen their young tears flow; The clouds, in spirit-like descent, Their deep thoughts by one touch had blent, And the wild storms link'd them to each other— How dear can peril make a brother! Now is their hearth a forsaken spot, The vine waves unpruned o'er their mountain-cot Away, in that holy affection's might, The maiden is gone, like a breeze of the night;— She is gone forth alone, but her lighted face, Filling with soul every secret place, Hath a dower from Heaven, and a gift of sway, To arouse brave hearts in its hidden way, Like the sudden flinging forth on high, Of a banner that startleth silently! She hath wander'd through many a hamlet-vale, Telling its children her brother's tale; And the strains, by his spirit pour'd away, Freely as fountains might shower their spray, From her fervent lip a new life have caught, And a power to kindle yet bolder thought; While sometimes a melody, all her own, Like a gush of tears in its plaintive tone, May be heard 'midst the lonely rocks to flow, Clear through the water-chimes—clear, yet low. “Thou'rt not where wild-flowers wave O'er crag and sparry cave; Thou'rt not where pines are sounding, Or joyous torrents bounding— Alas, my brother! “Thou'rt not where green, on high, The brighter pastures lie; Ev'n those, thine own wild places, Bear of our chain dark traces: Alas, my brother! “Far hath the sunbeam spread, Nor found thy lonely bed; Long hath the fresh wind sought thee, Nor one sweet whisper brought thee— Alas, my brother! “Thou, that for joy wert born, Free as the wings of morn! Will aught thy young life cherish, Where the Alpine rose would perish? Alas, my brother! “Canst thou be singing still, As once on every hill? Is not thy soul forsaken, And the bright gift from thee taken?— Alas, alas, my brother!” And was the bright gift from the captive fled? Like the fire on his hearth, was his spirit dead? Not so!—but as rooted in stillness deep, The pure stream-lily its place will keep, Though its tearful urns to the blast may quiver, While the red waves rush down the foaming river So freedom's faith in his bosom lay, Trembling, yet not to be borne away! He thought of the Alps and their breezy air, And felt that his country no chains might bear; He thought of the hunter's haughty life, And knew there must yet be noble strife; But, oh! when he thought of that orphan maid, His high heart melted—he wept and pray'd! For he saw her not as she moved e'en then, A wakener of heroes in every glen, With a glance inspired which no grief could tame, Bearing on Hope like a torch's flame, While the strengthening voice of mighty wrongs Gave echoes back to her thrilling songs; But his dreams were fill'd by a haunting tone, Sad as a sleeping infant's moan; And his soul was pierced by a mournful eye, Which look'd on it—oh! how beseechingly! And there floated past him a fragile form, With a willowy droop, as beneath the storm; Till wakening in anguish, his faint heart strove In vain with its burden of helpless love! —Thus woke the dreamer one weary night— There flash'd thro' his dungeon a swift strong light; He sprang up—he climb'd to the grating-bars, —It was not the rising of moon or stars, But a signal flame from a peak of snow, Rock'd through the dark skies, to and fro! There shot forth another—another still— A hundred answers of hill to hill! Tossing like pines in the tempest's way, Joyously, wildly, the bright spires play, And each is hail'd with a pealing shout, For the high Alps waving their banners out! Erni, young Erni! the land hath risen! —Alas! to be lone in thy narrow prison! Those free streamers glancing, and thou not there! —Is the moment of rapture, or fierce despair? —Hark! there's a tumult that shakes his cell, At the gates of the mountain citadel! Hark! a clear voice through the rude sounds ringing! Doth he know the strain, and the wild, sweet singing? “There may not long be fetters, Where the cloud is earth's array, And the bright floods leap from cave and steep, Like a hunter on the prey! “There may not long be fetters, Where the white Alps have their towers; Unto eagle-homes, if the arrow comes, The chain is not for ours!” It is she!—She is come like a dayspring beam, She that so mournfully shadow'd his dream! With her shining eyes and her buoyant form, She is come! her tears on his cheek are warm; And O! the thrill in that weeping voice! “My brother, my brother! come forth, rejoice!” —Poet! the land of thy love is free, —Sister! thy brother is won by thee! TO THE MOUNTAIN WINDS. ?“How divine The liberty, for frail, for mortal man, To roam at large among unpeopled glens, And mountainous retirements, only trod By devious footsteps!—Regions consecrate To oldest time!—And reckless of the storm That keeps the raven quiet in his nest, Be as a presence or a motion—One Among the many there.” Wordsworth. Mountain winds! oh! whither do ye call me? Vainly, vainly would my steps pursue! Chains of care to lower earth enthral me, Wherefore thus my weary spirit woo? Oh! the strife of this divided being! Is there peace where ye are borne on high? Could we soar to your proud eyries fleeing, In our hearts would haunting memories die? Those wild places are not as a dwelling Whence the footsteps of the loved are gone! Never from those rocky halls came swelling Voice of kindness in familiar tone! Surely music of oblivion sweepeth In the pathway of your wanderings free; And the torrent, wildly as it leapeth, Sings of no lost home amidst its glee. There the rushing of the falcon's pinion Is not from some hidden pang to fly; All things breathe of power and stern dominion— Not of hearts that in vain yearnings die. Mountain winds! oh! is it, is it only Where man's trace hath been that so we pine? Bear me up, to grow in thought less lonely, Even at nature's deepest, loneliest shrine! Wild, and mighty, and mysterious singers! At whose tone my heart within me burns; Bear me where the last red sunbeam lingers, Where the waters have their secret urns! There to commune with a loftier spirit Than the troubling shadows of regret; There the wings of freedom to inherit, Where the enduring and the wing'd are met. Hush, proud voices! gentle be your falling! Woman's lot thus chainless may not be; Hush! the heart your trumpet sounds are calling, Darkly still may grow—but never free! THE PROCESSION. “‘The peace which passeth all understanding,’ disclosed itself in her looks and movements. It lay on her countenance like a steady unshadowed moonlight.” Coleridge. There were trampling sounds of many feet, And music rush'd through the crowded street; Proud music, such as tells the sky Of a chief return'd from victory. There were banners to the winds unroll'd, With haughty words on each blazon'd fold; High battle-names, which had rung of yore, When lances clash'd on the Syrian shore. Borne from their dwellings, green and lone, There were flowers of the woods on the pathway strown; And wheels that crush'd as they swept along— Oh! what doth the violet amidst the throng? I saw where a bright procession pass'd The gates of a minster old and vast; And a king to his crowning place was led, Through a sculptured line of the warrior dead. I saw, far gleaming, the long array Of trophies, on those high tombs that lay, And the colour'd light, that wrapp'd them all, Rich, deep, and sad, as a royal pall. But a lowlier grave soon won mine eye Away from th' ancestral pageantry: A grave by the lordly minster's gate, Unhonour'd, and yet not desolate. It was but a dewy greensward bed, Meet for the rest of a peasant head; But Love—oh! lovelier than all beside!— That lone place guarded and glorified. For a gentle form stood watching there, Young—but how sorrowfully fair! Keeping the flowers of the holy spot, That reckless feet might profane them not. Clear, pale and clear, was the tender cheek, And her eye, though tearful, serenely meek; And I deem'd, by its lifted gaze of love, That her sad heart's treasure was all above. For alone she seem'd 'midst the throng to be, Like a bird of the waves far away at sea; Alone, in a mourner's vest array'd, And with folded hands, e'en as if she pray'd. It faded before me, that masque of pride, The haughty swell of the music died; Banner, and armour, and tossing plume, All melted away in the twilight's gloom. But that orphan form, with its willowy grace, And the speaking prayer in that pale, calm face, Still, still o'er my thoughts in the night-hour glide— —Oh! Love is lovelier than all beside. THE BROKEN LUTE. “When the lamp is shatter'd, The light in the dust lies dead; When the cloud is scatter'd, The rainbow's glory is shed. When the lute is broken, Sweet sounds are remember'd not; When the words are spoken, Loved accents are soon forgot. As music and splendour Survive not the lamp and lute, The heart's echoes render No song when the spirit is mute.” Shelley. She dwelt in proud Venetian halls, 'Midst forms that breathed from the pictured walls; But a glow of beauty like her own, There had no dream of the painter thrown. Lit from within was her noble brow, As an urn, whence rays from a lamp may flow; Her young, clear cheek, had a changeful hue, As if ye might see how the soul wrought through; And every flash of her fervent eye Seem'd the bright wakening of Poesy. Even thus it was!—from her childhood's years— A being of sudden smiles and tears— Passionate visions, quick light and shade, Such was that high-born Italian maid! And the spirit of song in her bosom-cell, Dwelt, as the odours in violets dwell, Or as the sounds in Eolian strings— Or in aspen-leaves the quiverings; There, ever there, with the life enshrined, Waiting the call of the faintest wind. Oft, on the wave of the Adrian sea, In the city's hour of moonlight glee, Oft would that gift of the southern sky O'erflow from her lips in melody; Oft amid festal halls it came, Like the springing forth of a sudden flame— Till the dance was hush'd, and the silvery tone Of her inspiration was heard alone. And fame went with her, the bright, the crown'd, And music floated her steps around; And every lay of her soul was borne Through the sunny land, as on wings of morn. And was the daughter of Venice blest With a power so deep in her youthful breast? Could she be happy, o'er whose dark eye So many changes and dreams went by? And in whose cheek the swift crimson wrought As if but born from the rush of thought? Yes! in the brightness of joy awhile She moved as a bark in the sunbeam's smile; For her spirit, as over her lyre's full chord, All, all on a happy love was pour'd! How loves a heart, whence the stream of song Flows, like the life-blood, quick, bright, and strong? How loves a heart, which hath never proved One breath of the world?—Even so she loved! Bless'd, though the lord of her soul afar, Was charging the foremost in Moslem war— Bearing the flag of St Mark's on high, As a ruling star in the Grecian sky. Proud music breathed in her song, when fame Gave a tone more thrilling to his name; And her trust in his love was a woman's faith— Perfect, and fearing no change but death. But the fields are won from the Othman host, In the land that quell'd the Persian's boast, And a thousand hearts in Venice burn, For the day of triumph and return! —The day is come! the flashing deep Foams where the galleys of victory sweep; And the sceptred city of the wave, With her festal splendour greets the brave; Cymbal and clarion, and voice, around, Make the air one stream of exulting sound, While the beautiful, with their sunny smiles, Look from each hall of the hundred isles. But happiest and brightest that day of all, Robed for her warrior's festival, Moving a queen 'midst the radiant throng, Was she, th' inspired one, the maid of song! The lute he loved on her arm she bore, As she rush'd in her joy to the crowded shore; With a hue on her cheek like the damask glow By the sunset given unto mountain snow, And her eye all fill'd with the spirit's play, Like the flash of a gem to the changeful day, And her long hair waving in ringlets bright— So came that being of hope and light! —One moment, Erminia! one moment more, And life, all the beauty of life, is o'er! The bark of her lover hath touch'd the strand— Whom leads he forth with a gentle hand? —A young fair form, whose nymph-like grace Accorded well with the Grecian face, And the eye, in its clear soft darkness meek, And the lashes that droop'd o'er a pale rose cheek; And he look'd on that beauty with tender pride— The warrior hath brought back an Eastern bride! But how stood she, the forsaken, there, Struck by the lightning of swift despair? Still, as amazed with grief, she stood, And her cheek to her heart sent back the blood, And there came from her quivering lip no word, Only the fall of her lute was heard, As it dropp'd from her hand at her rival's feet, Into fragments, whose dying thrill was sweet! What more remaineth? her day was done; Her fate and the Broken Lute's were one! The light, the vision, the gift of power, Pass'd from her soul in that mortal hour, Like the rich sound from the shatter'd string, Whence the gush of sweetness no more might spring! As an eagle struck in his upward flight, So was her hope from its radiant height, And her song went with it for evermore, A gladness taken from sea and shore! She had moved to the echoing sound of fame— Silently, silently, died her name! Silently melted her life away, As ye have seen a young flower decay, Or a lamp that hath swiftly burn'd, expire, Or a bright stream shrink from the summer's fire, Leaving its channel all dry and mute— Woe for the Broken Heart and Lute! THE BURIAL IN THE DESERT. “How weeps yon gallant band O'er him their valour could not save! For the bayonet is red with gore, And he, the beautiful and brave, Now sleeps in Egypt's sand.” Wilson. In the shadow of the pyramid Our brother's grave we made, When the battle-day was done, And the desert's parting sun A field of death survey'd. The blood-red sky above us Was darkening into night, And the Arab watching silently Our sad and hurried rite. The voice of Egypt's river Came hollow and profound, And one lone palm-tree, where we stood, Rock'd with a shivery sound: While the shadow of the Pyramid Hung o'er the grave we made, When the battle-day was done, And the desert's parting sun A field of death survey'd. The fathers of our brother Were borne to knightly tombs, With torch-light and with anthem-note, And many waving plumes: But he, the last and noblest Of that high Norman race, With a few brief words of soldier-love Was gather'd to his place; In the shadow of the Pyramid, Where his youthful form we laid, When the battle-day was done, And the desert's parting sun A field of death survey'd. But let him, let him slumber By the old Egyptian wave! It is well with those who bear their fame Unsullied to the grave! When brightest names are breathed on, When loftiest fall so fast, We would not call our brother back On dark days to be cast,— From the shadow of the Pyramid, Where his noble heart we laid, When the battle-day was done, And the desert's parting sun A field of death survey'd. TO A PICTURE OF THE MADONNA. “Ave Maria! May our spirits dare Look up to thine, and to thy Son's above?” Byron. Fair vision! thou'rt from sunny skies, Born where the rose hath richest dyes; To thee a southern heart hath given That glow of love, that calm of heaven, And round thee cast th' ideal gleam, The light that is but of a dream. Far hence, where wandering music fills The haunted air of Roman hills, Or where Venetian waves of yore Heard melodies, they hear no more, Some proud old minster's gorgeous aisle Hath known the sweetness of thy smile. Or haply, from a lone, dim shrine, 'Mid forests of the Apennine, Whose breezy sounds of cave and dell Pass like a floating anthem-swell, Thy soft eyes o'er the pilgrim's way Shed blessings with their gentle ray. Or gleaming through a chestnut wood, Perchance thine island-chapel stood, Where from the blue Sicilian sea, The sailor's hymn hath risen to thee, And bless'd thy power to guide, to save, Madonna! watcher of the wave! Oh! might a voice, a whisper low, Forth from those lips of beauty flow! Could'st thou but speak of all the tears, The conflicts, and the pangs of years, Which, at thy secret shrine reveal'd, Have gush'd from human hearts unseal'd! Surely to thee hath woman come, As a tired wanderer back to home! Unveiling many a timid guest, And treasured sorrow of her breast, A buried love—a wasting care— Oh! did those griefs win peace from prayer? And did the poet's fervid soul To thee lay bare its inmost scroll? Those thoughts, which pour'd their quenchless fire And passion o'er th' Italian lyre, Did they to still submission die, Beneath thy calm, religious eye? And hath the crested helmet bow'd Before thee, 'midst the incense-cloud? Hath the crown'd leader's bosom lone, To thee its haughty griefs made known? Did thy glance break their frozen sleep, And win the unconquer'd one to weep? Hush'd is the anthem—closed the vow— The votive garland wither'd now; Yet holy still to me thou art, Thou that hast sooth'd so many a heart! And still must blessed influence flow From the meek glory of thy brow. Still speak to suffering woman's love, Of rest for gentle hearts above; Of hope, that hath its treasure there, Of home, that knows no changeful air! Bright form, lit up with thoughts divine, Ave! such power be ever thine! A THOUGHT OF THE ROSE. How much of memory dwells amidst thy bloom, Rose! ever wearing beauty for thy dower! The bridal-day—the festival—the tomb— Thou hast thy part in each, thou stateliest flower! Therefore with thy soft breath come floating by A thousand images of love or grief, Dreams, fill'd with tokens of mortality, Deep thoughts of all things beautiful and brief. Not such thy spells o'er those that hail'd thee first, In the clear light of Eden's golden day! There thy rich leaves to crimson glory burst, Link'd with no dim remembrance of decay. Rose! for the banquet gather'd, and the bier; Rose! colour'd now by human hope and pain; Surely where death is not—nor change, nor fear, Yet may we meet thee, joy's own flower again! DREAMS OF HEAVEN. “We colour Heaven with our own human thoughts, Our vain aspirings, fond remembrances, Our passionate love, that seems unto itself An Immortality.” Dream'st thou of Heaven?—what dreams are thine? Fair child, fair gladsome child? With eyes that like the dewdrop shine, And bounding footsteps wild! Tell me what hues the immortal shore Can wear, my bird! to thee? Ere yet one shadow hath pass'd o'er Thy glance and spirit free? “Oh! beautiful is Heaven, and bright, With long, long summer days; I see its lilies gleam in light, Where many a fountain plays. “And there uncheck'd, methinks, I rove, And seek where young flowers lie, In vale and golden-fruited grove— Flowers that are not to die!” Thou poet of the lonely thought, Sad heir of gifts divine! Say with what solemn glory fraught, Is heaven in dreams of thine? “Oh! where the living waters flow Along that radiant shore, My soul, a wanderer here, shall know, The exile thirst no more. “The burden of the stranger's heart Which here alone I bear, Like the night-shadow shall depart, With my first wakening there. “And borne on eagle wings afar, Free thought shall claim its dower, From every realm, from every star, Of glory and of power.” O woman! with the soft sad eye, Of spiritual gleam, Tell me of those bright worlds on high, How doth thy fond heart dream? By thy sweet mournful voice I know, On thy pale brow I see, That thou hast loved, in fear, and woe— Say what is Heaven to thee? “Oh! Heaven is where no secret dread May haunt love's meeting hour, Where from the past no gloom is shed O'er the heart's chosen bower: “Where every sever'd wreath is bound— Where none have heard the knell That smites the heart with that deep sound— Farewell—beloved, farewell!” THE WISH. Come to me, when my soul Hath but a few dim hours to linger here; When earthly chains are as a shrivell'd scroll, Oh! let me feel thy presence! be but near! That I may look once more Into thine eyes, which never changed for me; That I may speak to thee of that bright shore, Where, with our treasure, we have longed to be. Thou friend of many days! Of sadness and of joy, of home and hearth! Will not thy spirit aid me then to raise The trembling pinions of my hope from earth? By every solemn thought Which on our hearts hath sunk in days gone by, From the deep voices of the mountains caught, Or all th' adoring silence of the sky; By every lofty theme Whereon, in low-toned reverence we have spoken, By our communion in each fervent dream That sought from realms beyond the grave a token; And by our tears for those Whose loss hath touch'd our world with hues of death; And by the hopes that with their dust repose, As flowers await the south-wind's vernal breath: Come to me in that day— The one—the sever'd from all days—O friend! Even then, if human thought may then have sway, My soul with thine shall yet rejoice to blend. Nor then, nor there alone: I ask my heart if all indeed must die; All that of holiest feelings it hath known? And my heart's voice replies—Eternity! MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. WRITTEN AFTER VISITING A TOMB, NEAR WOODSTOCK, IN THE COUNTY OF KILKENNY. See the “Grave of a Poetess,” in the “Records of Woman,” on the same subject, and written several years previously to visiting the scene. “Yes! hide beneath the mouldering heap, The undelighting, slighted thing; There in the cold earth, buried deep, In silence let it wait the Spring.” Mrs Tighe's Poem on the Lily. I stood where the lip of song lay low, Where the dust had gather'd on Beauty's brow; Where stillness hung on the heart of Love, And a marble weeper kept watch above. I stood in the silence of lonely thought, Of deep affections that inly wrought, Troubled, and dreamy, and dim with fear— They knew themselves exiled spirits here! Then didst thou pass me in radiance by, Child of the sunbeam, bright butterfly! Thou that dost bear, on thy fairy wings, No burden of mortal sufferings. Thou wert flitting past that solemn tomb, Over a bright world of joy and bloom; And strangely I felt, as I saw thee shine, The all that sever'd thy life and mine. Mine, with its inborn mysterious things Of love and grief, its unfathom'd springs; And quick thoughts wandering o'er earth and sky, With voices to question eternity! Thine, in its reckless and joyous way, Like an embodied breeze at play! Child of the sunlight!—thou wing'd and free! One moment, one moment, I envied thee! Thou art not lonely, though born to roam, Thou hast no longings that pine for home; Thou seek'st not the haunts of the bee and bird, To fly from the sickness of hope deferr'd: In thy brief being no strife of mind, No boundless passion, is deeply shrined; While I, as I gazed on thy swift flight by, One hour of my soul seem'd infinity! And she, that voiceless below me slept, Flow'd not her song from a heart that wept? —O Love and Song! though of Heaven your powers, Dark is your fate in this world of ours. Yet, ere I turn'd from that silent place, Or ceased from watching thy sunny race, Thou, even thou, on those glancing wings, Didst waft me visions of brighter things! Thou that dost image the freed soul's birth, And its flight away o'er the mists of earth, Oh! fitly thy path is through flowers that rise Round the dark chamber where Genius lies! EPITAPH. Farewell, beloved and mourn'd! we miss awhile Thy tender gentleness of voice and smile, And that bless'd gift of Heaven, to cheer us lent— That thrilling touch, divinely eloquent, Which breathed the soul of prayer, deep, fervent, high, Through thy rich strains of sacred harmony; Yet from those very memories there is born A soft light, pointing to celestial morn. Oh! bid it guide us where thy footsteps trode, To meet at last “the pure in heart” with God! TO GIULIO REGONDI, THE BOY GUITARIST. Blessing and love be round thee still, fair boy! Never may suffering wake a deeper tone, Than genius now, in its first fearless joy, Calls forth exulting from the chords which own Thy fairy touch! Oh! may'st thou ne'er be taught The power whose fountain is in troubled thought! For in the light of those confiding eyes, And on the ingenuous calm of that clear brow, A dower, more precious e'en than genius lies, A pure mind's worth, a warm heart's vernal glow! God, who hath graced thee thus, oh, gentle child, Keep 'midst the world thy brightness undefiled! O YE HOURS. O ye hours! ye sunny hours! Floating lightly by, Are ye come with birds and flowers, Odours and blue sky? “Yes, we come, again we come, Through the woodpaths free; Bringing many a wanderer home, With the bird and bee.” O ye hours! ye sunny hours! Are ye wafting song? Doth wild music stream in showers, All the groves among? “Yes, the nightingale is there While the starlight reigns, Making young leaves and sweet air Tremble with her strains.” O ye hours! ye sunny hours! In your silent flow, Ye are mighty, mighty powers! Bring ye bliss or woe? “Ask not this—oh! seek not this! Yield your hearts awhile To the soft wind's balmy kiss, And the heavens' bright smile. “Throw not shades of anxious thought O'er the glowing flowers! We are come with sunshine fraught, Question not the hours!” THE FREED BIRD. Return, return, my bird! I have dress'd thy cage with flowers, 'Tis lovely as a violet bank In the heart of forest bowers. “I am free, I am free—I return no more! The weary time of the cage is o'er; Through the rolling clouds I can soar on high, The sky is around me—the blue bright sky! “The hills lie beneath me, spread far and clear, With their glowing heath-flowers and bounding deer, I see the waves flash on the sunny shore— I am free, I am free—I return no more!” Alas, alas! my bird! Why seek'st thou to be free? Wert thou not bless'd in thy little bower, When thy song breathed nought but glee? “Did my song of the summer breathe nought but glee? Did the voice of the captive seem sweet to thee? —O! hadst thou known its deep meaning well, It had tales of a burning heart to tell! “From a dream of the forest that music sprang, Through its notes the peal of a torrent rang; And its dying fall, when it sooth'd thee best, Sigh'd for wild-flowers and a leafy nest.” Was it with thee thus, my bird? Yet thine eye flash'd clear and bright; I have seen the glance of sudden joy In its quick and dewy light. “It flash'd with the fire of a tameless race, With the soul of the wild wood, my native place! With the spirit that panted through heaven to soar— Woo me not back—I return no more! “My home is high, amidst rocking trees, My kindred things are the star and the breeze, And the fount uncheck'd in its lonely play, And the odours that wander afar away!” Farewell—farewell, then, bird! I have call'd on spirits gone, And it may be they joy'd, like thee, to part— Like thee, that wert all my own! “If they were captives, and pined like me, Though love may guard them, they joy'd to be free; They sprang from the earth with a burst of power, To the strength of their wings, to their triumph's hour! “Call them not back when the chain is riven, When the way of the pinion is all through heaven! Farewell!—with my song through the clouds I soar, I pierce the blue skies—I am earth's no more!” MARGUERITE OF FRANCE. “Thou falcon-hearted dove.” Coleridge. The Moslem spears were gleaming Round Damietta's towers, Though a Christian banner from her wall Waved free its lily-flowers. Ay, proudly did the banner wave, As queen of earth and air; But faint hearts throbb'd beneath its folds, In anguish and despair. Deep, deep in Paynim dungeon Their kingly chieftain lay, And low on many an Eastern field Their knighthood's best array. 'Twas mournful, when at feasts they met, The wine-cup round to send, For each that touch'd it silently, Then miss'd a gallant friend! And mournful was their vigil On the beleaguer'd wall, And dark their slumber, dark with dreams Of slow defeat and fall. Yet a few hearts of chivalry Rose high to breast the storm, And one—of all the loftiest there— Thrill'd in a woman's form. A woman, meekly bending O'er the slumber of her child, With her soft sad eyes of weeping love, As the Virgin Mother's mild. Oh! roughly cradled was thy babe, 'Midst the clash of spear and lance, And a strange, wild bower was thine, young queen! Fair Marguerite of France! A dark and vaulted chamber, Like a scene for wizard-spell, Deep in the Saracenic gloom Of the warrior citadel; And there 'midst arms the couch was spread, And with banners curtain'd o'er, For the daughter of the minstrel-land, The gay Provençal shore! For the bright queen of St Louis, The star of court and hall!— But the deep strength of the gentle heart, Wakes to the tempest's call! Her lord was in the Paynim's hold, His soul with grief oppress'd, Yet calmly lay the desolate, With her young babe on her breast! There were voices in the city, Voices of wrath and fear— “The walls grow weak, the strife is vain, We will not perish here! Yield! yield! and let the crescent gleam O'er tower and bastion high! Our distant homes are beautiful— We stay not here to die!” They bore those fearful tidings To the sad queen where she lay— They told a tale of wavering hearts, Of treason and dismay: The blood rush'd through her pearly cheek, The sparkle to her eye— “Now call me hither those recreant knights From the bands of Italy!” The proposal to capitulate is attributed by the French historian to the Knights of Pisa. Then through the vaulted chambers Stern iron footsteps rang; And heavily the sounding floor Gave back the sabre's clang. They stood around her—steel-clad men, Moulded for storm and fight, But they quail'd before the loftier soul In that pale aspect bright. Yes—as before the falcon shrinks The bird of meaner wing, So shrank they from th' imperial glance Of her—that fragile thing! And her flute-like voice rose clear and high, Through the din of arms around, Sweet, and yet stirring to the soul, As a silver clarion's sound. “The honour of the Lily Is in your hands to keep, And the banner of the Cross, for Him Who died on Calvary's steep: And the city which for Christian prayer Hath heard the holy bell— And is it these your hearts would yield To the godless infidel? “Then bring me here a breastplate And a helm, before ye fly, And I will gird my woman's form, And on the ramparts die! And the boy whom I have borne for woe, But never for disgrace, Shall go within mine arms to death Meet for his royal race. “Look on him as he slumbers In the shadow of the lance! Then go, and with the Cross forsake The princely babe of France! But tell your homes ye left one heart To perish undefiled; A woman and a queen, to guard Her honour and her child!” Before her words they thrill'd, like leaves When winds are in the wood; And a deepening murmur told of men Roused to a loftier mood. And her babe awoke to flashing swords, Unsheath'd in many a hand, As they gather'd round the helpless One, Again a noble band! “We are thy warriors, lady! True to the Cross and thee! The spirit of thy kindling words On every sword shall be! Rest, with thy fair child on thy breast, Rest—we will guard thee well! St Dennis for the Lily-flower, And the Christian citadel!” TO CAROLINE. When thy bounding step I hear, And thy soft voice, low and clear; When thy glancing eyes I meet, In their sudden laughter sweet— Thou, I dream, wert surely born For a path by care unworn! Thou must be a shelter'd flower, With but sunshine for thy dower. Ah! fair child, not e'en for thee May this lot of brightness be; Yet, if grief must add a tone To thine accents now unknown; If within that cloudless eye Sadder thought must one day lie, Still, I trust the signs which tell On thy life a light shall dwell, Light—thy gentle spirit's own, From within around thee thrown. THE FLOWER OF THE DESERT. “Who does not recollect the exultation of Vaillant over a flower in the torrid wastes of Africa? The affecting mention of the influence of a flower upon the mind, by Mungo Park, in a time of suffering and despondency, in the heart of the same savage country, is familiar to every one.”—Howitt's Book of the Seasons. Why art thou thus in thy beauty cast, O lonely, loneliest flower; Where the sound of song hath never pass'd From human hearth or bower? I pity thee, for thy heart of love, For that glowing heart, that fain Would breathe out joy with each wind to rove— In vain, lost thing! in vain! I pity thee, for thy wasted bloom, For thy glory's fleeting hour, For the desert place, thy living tomb— O lonely, loneliest flower! I said—but a low voice made reply, “Lament not for the flower! Though its blossoms all unmark'd must die, They have had a glorious dower. “Though it bloom afar from the minstrel's way, And the paths where lovers tread; Yet strength and hope, like an inborn day, By its odours hath been shed. “Yes! dews more sweet than ever fell O'er island of the blest, Were shaken forth, from its purple bell, On a suffering human breast. “A wanderer came, as a stricken deer, O'er the waste of burning sand, He bore the wound of an Arab spear, He fled from a ruthless band. “And dreams of home in a troubled tide Swept o'er his darkening eye, As he lay down by the fountain side, In his mute despair to die. “But his glance was caught by the desert's flower, The precious boon of Heaven; And sudden hope, like a vernal shower, To his fainting heart was given. For the bright flower spoke of one above; Of the prescence felt to brood, With a spirit of pervading love, O'er the wildest solitude. “Oh! the seed was thrown those wastes among In a bless'd and gracious hour, For the lorn one rose in heart made strong, By the lonely, loneliest flower!” TROUBADOUR SONG. They rear'd no trophy o'er his grave, They bade no requiem flow; What left they there to tell the brave That a warrior sleeps below? A shiver'd spear, a cloven shield, A helm with its white plume torn, And a blood-stain'd turf on the fatal field, Where a chief to his rest was borne. He lies not where his fathers sleep, But who hath a tomb more proud? For the Syrian wilds his records keep, And a banner is his shroud. THE HUGUENOT'S FAREWELL. I stand upon the threshold stone Of mine ancestral hall; I hear my native river moan; I see the night o'er my old forests fall. I look round on the dark'ning vale That saw my childhood's plays: The low wind in its rising wail Hath a strange tone, a sound of other days. But I must rule my swelling breast: A sign is in the sky; Bright o'er yon grey rock's eagle nest Shines forth a warning star—it bids me fly. My father's sword is in my hand, His deep voice haunts mine ear; He tells me of the noble band Whose lives have left a brooding glory here. He bids their offspring guard from stain Their pure and lofty faith; And yield up all things, to maintain The cause for which they girt themselves to death. And I obey.—I leave their towers Unto the stranger's tread; Unto the creeping grass and flowers; Unto the fading pictures of the dead. I leave their shields to slow decay, Their banners to the dust; I go, and only bear away Their old majestic name—a solemn trust! I go up to the ancient hills, Where chains may never be, Where leap in joy the torrent rills, Where man may worship God, alone and free. There shall an altar and a camp Impregnably arise; There shall be lit a quenchless lamp, To shine, unwavering, through the open skies. And song shall 'midst the rocks be heard, And fearless prayer ascend; While, thrilling to God's holy word, The mountain pines in adoration bend. And there the burning heart no more Its deep thought shall suppress, But the long-buried truth shall pour Free currents thence, amidst the wilderness. Then fare thee well, my mother's bower, Farewell, my father's hearth; Perish my home! where lawless power Hath rent the tie of love to native earth. Perish! let deathlike silence fall Upon the lone abode: Spread fast, dark ivy, spread thy pall;— I go up to the mountains with my God. THE ENGLISH BOY. “Go, call thy sons; instruct them what a debt They owe their ancestors; and make them swear To pay it, by transmitting down entire Those sacred rights to which themselves were born.” Akenside. Look from the ancient mountains down, My noble English boy! Thy country's fields around thee gleam In sunlight and in joy. Ages have roll'd since foeman's march Pass'd o'er that old firm sod; For well the land hath fealty held To freedom and to God! Gaze proudly on, my English boy! And let thy kindling mind Drink in the spirit of high thought From every chainless wind! There, in the shadow of old Time, The halls beneath thee lie, Which pour'd forth to the fields of yore Our England's chivalry. How bravely and how solemnly They stand, 'midst oak and yew! Whence Cressy's yeomen haply framed The bow, in battle true. And round their walls the good swords hang Whose faith knew no alloy, And shields of knighthood, pure from stain— Gaze on, my English boy! Gaze where the hamlet's ivied church Gleams by the antique elm, Or where the minster lifts the cross High through the air's blue realm. Martyrs have shower'd their free heart's blood That England's prayer might rise, From those grey fanes of thoughtful years, Unfetter'd, to the skies. Along their aisles, beneath their trees, This earth's most glorious dust, Once fired with valour, wisdom, song, Is laid in holy trust. Gaze on—gaze farther, farther yet— My gallant English boy! Yon blue sea bears thy country's flag, The billows' pride and joy! Those waves in many a fight have closed Above her faithful dead; That red-cross flag victoriously Hath floated o'er their bed. They perish'd—this green turf to keep By hostile tread unstain'd; These knightly halls inviolate, Those churches unprofaned. And high and clear, their memory's light Along our shore is set, And many an answering beacon-fire Shall there be kindled yet! Lift up thy heart, my English boy! And pray, like them to stand, Should God so summon thee, to guard The altars of the land. ANTIQUE GREEK LAMENT. By the blue waters—the restless ocean waters, Restless as they with their many-flashing surges, Lonely I wander, weeping for my lost one! I pine for thee through all the joyless day— Through the long night I pine: the golden sun Looks dim since thou hast left me, and the Spring Seems but to weep. Where art thou, my beloved? Night after night, in fond hope vigilant, By the old temple on the breezy cliff, These hands have heap'd the watch-fire, till it stream'd Red o'er the shining columns—darkly red— Along the crested billows!—but in vain; Thy white sail comes not from the distant isles— Yet thou wert faithful ever. Oh! the deep Hath shut above thy head—that graceful head; The sea-weed mingles with thy clustering locks; The white sail never will bring back the loved! By the blue waters—the restless ocean waters, Restless as they with their many-flashing surges, Lonely I wander, weeping for my lost one! Where art thou?—where?—had I but lingering prest On thy cold lips the last long kiss; but smooth'd The parted ringlets of thy shining hair With love's fond touch, my heart's cry had been still'd Into a voiceless grief; I would have strew'd With all the pale flowers of the vernal woods— White violets, and the mournful hyacinth, And frail anemone, thy marble brow, In slumber beautiful!—I would have heap'd Sweet boughs and precious odours on thy pyre, And with mine own shorn tresses hung thine urn, And many a garland of the pallid rose. But thou liest far away!—No funeral chant, Save the wild moaning of the wave, is thine: No pyre—save, haply, some long-buried wreck; Thou that wert fairest—thou that wert most loved! By the blue waters—the restless ocean waters, Restless as they with their many-flashing surges, Lonely I wander, weeping for my lost one! Come, in the dreamy shadow of the night, And speak to me!—E'en though thy voice be changed, My heart would know it still. Oh, speak to me, And say if yet, in some dim, far-off world, Which knows not how the festal sunshine burns— O yet, in some pale mead of Asphodel, We two shall meet again! Oh, I would quit The day, rejoicingly—the rosy light— All the rich flowers and fountains musical, And sweet familiar melodies of earth, To dwell with thee below!—Thou answerest not! The powers whom I have call'd upon are mute: The voices buried in old whispery caves, And by lone river-sources, and amidst The gloom and myst'ry of dark prophet-oaks, The wood-gods' haunt—they give me no reply! All silent—heaven and earth!—for evermore From the deserted mountains thou art gone— For ever from the melancholy groves, Whose laurels wail thee with a shivering sound!— And I—I pine through all the joyous day, Through the long night I pine—as fondly pines The night's own bird, dissolving her lorn life To song in moonlight woods. Thou hear'st me not! The heavens are pitiless of human tears: The deep sea-darkness is about thy head; The white sail never will bring back the loved! By the blue waters—the restless ocean waters, Restless as they with their many-flashing surges, Lonely I wander, weeping for my lost one! TO THE BLUE ANEMONE. Flower of starry clearness bright, Quivering urn of colour'd light, Hast thou drawn thy cup's rich dye From the intenseness of the sky? From a long, long fervent gaze Through the year's first golden days, Up that blue and silent deep, Where, like things of sculptured sleep, Alabaster clouds repose, With the sunshine on their snows? Thither was thy heart's love turning, Like a censer ever burning, Till the purple heavens in thee Set their smile, Anemone? Or can those warm tints be caught Each from some quick glow of thought? So much of bright soul there seems In thy bendings and thy gleams, So much thy sweet life resembles That which feels, and weeps, and trembles, I could deem thee spirit-fill'd, As a reed by music thrill'd, When thy being I behold To each loving breath unfold, Or like woman's willowy form, Shrink before the gathering storm; I could ask a voice from thee, Delicate Anemone! Flower! thou seem'st not born to die With thy radiant purity, But to melt in air away, Mingling with the soft Spring-day, When the crystal heavens are still, And faint azure veils each hill, And the lime-leaf doth not move, Save to songs that stir the grove, And earth all glorified is seen, As imaged in some lake serene; —Then thy vanishing should be, Pure and meek Anemone! Flower! the laurel still may shed Brightness round the victor's head; And the rose in beauty's hair Still its festal glory wear; And the willow-leaves droop o'er Brows which love sustains no more: But by living rays refined, Thou, the trembler of the wind, Thou, the spiritual flower Sentient of each breeze and shower, Thou, rejoicing in the skies, And transpierced with all their dyes; Breathing vase, with light o'erflowing, Gem-like to thy centre glowing Thou the poet's type shalt be, Flower of soul, Anemone! THE SONG OF PENITENCE. Suggested by the late Mrs Fletcher's Story of The Lost Life, published in the Amulet for 1830. UNFINISHED. He pass'd from earth Without his fame,—the calm, pure, starry fame He might have won, to guide on radiantly Full many a noble soul,—he sought it not; And e'en like brief and barren lightning pass'd The wayward child of genius. And the songs Which his wild spirit, in the pride of life, Had shower'd forth recklessly, as ocean-waves Fling up their treasures mingled with dark weed, They died before him;—they were winged seed, Scatter'd afar, and, falling on the rock Of the world's heart, had perish'd. One alone, One fervent, mournful, supplicating strain, The deep beseeching of a stricken breast, Survived the vainly-gifted. In the souls Of the kind few that loved him, with a love Faithful to even its disappointed hope, That song of tears found root, and by their hearths Full oft, in low and reverential tones, Fill'd with the piety of tenderness, Is murmur'd to their children, when his name On some faint harp-string of remembrance falls, Far from the world's rude voices, far away. Oh! hear, and judge him gently; 'twas his last. I come alone, and faint I come, To nature's arms I flee; The green woods take their wanderer home, But Thou, O Father! may I turn to thee? The earliest odour of the flower, The bird's first song is thine; Father in heaven! my dayspring's hour Pour'd its vain incense on another shrine. Therefore my childhood's once-loved scene Around me faded lies; Therefore, remembering what hath been, I ask, is this mine early paradise? It is, it is—but Thou art gone, Or if the trembling shade Breathe yet of thee, with alter'd tone Thy solemn whisper shakes a heart dismay'd. NATIONAL LYRICS. THE THEMES OF SONG. “Of truth, of grandeur, beanty, love, and hope, And melancholy fear subdued by faith.” Wordsworth. Where shall the minstrel find a theme? —Where'er, for freedom shed, Brave blood hath dyed some ancient stream, Amidst the mountains, red, Where'er a rock, a fount, a grove, Bears record to the faith Of love—deep, holy, fervent love, Victor o'er fear and death. Where'er a chieftain's crested brow Too soon hath been struck down, Or a bright virgin head laid low, Wearing its youth's first crown. Where'er a spire points up to heaven, Through storm and summer air, Telling, that all around have striven Man's heart, and hope, and prayer. Where'er a blessed home hath been, That now is home no more: A place of ivy, darkly green, Where laughter's light is o'er. Where'er, by some forsaken grave, Some nameless greensward heap, A bird may sing, a wild-flower wave, A star its vigil keep. Or where a yearning heart of old, A dream of shepherd men, With forms of more than earthly mould Hath peopled grot or glen. There may the bard's high themes be found— We die, we pass away; But faith, love, pity—these are bound To earth without decay. The heart that burns, the cheek that glows, The tear from hidden springs, The thorn and glory of the rose— These are undying things. Wave after wave of mighty stream To the deep sea hath gone: Yet not the less, like youth's bright dream, The exhaustless flood rolls on. RHINE SONG OF THE GERMAN SOLDIERS AFTER VICTORY. TO THE AIR OF “AM RHEIN, AM RHEIN.” SINGLE VOICE. It is the Rhine! our mountain vineyards laving, I see the bright flood shine, I see the bright flood shine! Sing on the march, with every banner waving— Sing, brothers, 'tis the Rhine! Sing, brothers, 'tis the Rhine! CHORUS. The Rhine! the Rhine! our own imperial river! Be glory on thy track, be glory on thy track! We left thy shores, to die or to deliver— We bear thee freedom back, we bear thee freedom back! SINGLE VOICE. Hail! hail! my childhood knew thy rush of water, Even as my mother's song; even as my mother's song; That sound went past me on the field of slaughter, And heart and arm grew strong! And heart and arm grew strong! CHORUS. Roll proudly on!—brave blood is with thee sweeping, Pour'd out by sons of thine, pour'd out by sons of thine, Where sword and spirit forth in joy were leaping, Like thee, victorious Rhine! Like thee, victorious Rhine! SINGLE VOICE. Home!—Home!—thy glad wave hath a tone of greeting, Thy path is by my home, thy path is by my home: Even now my children count the hours till meeting, O ransom'd ones, I come! O ransom'd ones, I come! CHORUS. Go, tell the seas, that chain shall bind thee never, Sound on by hearth and shrine, sound on by hearth and shrine! Sing through the hills that thou art free for ever— Lift up thy voice, O Rhine! Lift up thy voice, O Rhine! A SONG OF DELOS. “Terre, soleil, vallons, belle et douee nature, Je vous dois une larme aux bords de mon tombeau; L'air est si parfumé! la lumiere est si pure! Aux regards d'un Mourant le soleil est si beau!” Lamartine. A song was heard of old—a low, sweet song, On the blue seas by Delos: from that isle, The Sun-god's own domain, a gentle girl, Gentle—yet all inspired of soul, of mien, Lit with a life too perilously bright, Was borne away to die. How beautiful Seems this world to the dying!—but for her, The child of beauty and of poesy, And of soft Grecian skies—oh! who may dream Of all that from her changeful eye flash'd forth, Or glanced more quiveringly through starry tears, As on her land's rich vision, fane o'er fane Colour'd with loving light—she gazed her last, Her young life's last, that hour! From her pale brow And burning cheek she threw the ringlets back, And bending forward—as the spirit sway'd The reed-like form still to the shore beloved, Breathed the swan-music of her wild farewell O'er dancing waves:—“Oh! linger yet,” she cried, “Oh! linger, linger on the oar, Oh! pause upon the deep! That I may gaze yet once, once more, Where floats the golden day o'er fane and steep; Never so brightly smiled mine own sweet shore, —Oh! linger, linger on the parting oar! “I see the laurels fling back showers Of soft light still on many a shrine; I see the path to haunts of flowers Through the dim olives lead its gleaming line; I hear a sound of flutes—a swell of song— Mine is too low to reach that joyous throng! “Oh! linger, linger on the oar Beneath my native sky! Let my life part from that bright shore With day's last crimson—gazing let me die! Thou bark, glide slowly!—slowly should be borne The voyager that never shall return. “A fatal gift hath been thy dower, Lord of the Lyre! to me; With song and wreath from bower to bower, Sisters went bounding like young Oreads free; While I, through long, lone, voiceless hours apart, Have lain and listen'd to my beating heart. “Now, wasted by the inborn fire, I sink to early rest; The ray that lit the incense-pyre, Leaves unto death its temple in my breast. —O sunshine, skies, rich flowers! too soon I go, While round me thus triumphantly ye glow! “Bright isle! might but thine echoes keep A tone of my farewell, One tender accent, low and deep, Shrined 'midst thy founts and haunted rocks to dwell! Might my last breath send music to thy shore! —Oh! linger, seamen, linger on the oar!” ANCIENT GREEK CHANT OF VICTORY. “Fill high the bowl with Samian wine, Our virgins dance beneath the shade.” Byron. Io! they come, they come! Garlands for every shrine! Strike lyres to greet them home; Bring roses, pour ye wine! Swell, swell the Dorian flute Through the blue, triumphant sky! Let the Cittern's tone salute The sons of victory. With the offering of bright blood They have ransom'd hearth and tomb, Vineyard, and field, and flood;— Io! they come, they come! Sing it where olives wave, And by the glittering sea, And o'er each hero's grave— Sing, sing, the land is free! Mark ye the flashing oars, And the spears that light the deep? How the festal sunshine pours Where the lords of battle sweep! Each hath brought back his shield;— Maid greet thy lover home! Mother, from that proud field, Io! thy son is come! Who murmur'd of the dead? Hush, boding voice! We know That many a shining head Lies in its glory low. Breathe not those names to-day! They shall have their praise erelong, And a power all hearts to sway, In ever-burning song. But now shed flowers, pour wine, To hail the conquerors home! Bring wreaths for every shrine— Io! they come, they come! NAPLES. A SONG OF THE SYREN. “Then gentle winds arose, With many a mingled close Of wild Æolian sound and mountain odour keen; Where the clear Baian ocean Welters with air-like motion Within, above, around its bowers of starry green.” Shelley. Still is the Syren warbling on thy shore, Bright city of the waves!—her magic song Still with a dreamy sense of ecstasy Fills thy soft Summer air:—and while my glance Dwells on thy pictured loveliness, that lay Floats thus o'er fancy's ear; and thus to thee, Daughter of sunshine! doth the Syren sing. “Thine is the glad wave's flashing play, Thine is the laugh of the golden day, The golden day, and the glorious night, And the vine with its clusters all bathed in light! —Forget, forget, that thou art not free! Queen of the Summer sea. “Favour'd and crown'd of the earth and sky! Thine are all voices of melody, Wandering in moonlight through fane and tower, Floating o'er fountain and myrtle bower; Hark! how they melt o'er thy glittering sea; —Forget that thou art not free! “Let the wine flow in thy marble halls! Let the lute answer thy fountain falls! And deck thy feasts with the myrtle bough, And cover with roses thy glowing brow! Queen of the day and the summer sea, Forget that thou art not free!” So doth the Syren sing, while sparkling waves Dance to her chant. But sternly, mournfully, O city of the deep! from Sybil grots And Roman tombs, the echoes of thy shore Take up the cadence of her strain alone, Murmuring—Thou art not free!” THE FALL OF D'ASSAS. A BALLAD OF FRANCE. Alone through gloomy forest-shades A soldier went by night; No moonbeam pierced the dusky glades, No star shed guiding light. Yet on his vigil's midnight round The youth all cheerly pass'd; Uncheck'd by aught of boding sound That mutter'd in the blast. Where were his thoughts that lonely hour? —In his far home, perchance; His father's hall, his mother's bower, 'Midst the gay vines of France: Wandering from battles lost and won, To hear and bless again The rolling of the wide Garonne, Or murmur of the Seine. —Hush! hark!—did stealing steps go by, Came not faint whispers near? No! the wild wind hath many a sigh, Amidst the foliage sere. Hark, yet again!—and from his hand, What grasp hath wrench'd the blade? —Oh! single 'midst a hostile band, Young soldier! thou'rt betray'd! “Silence!” in under-tones they cry— “No whisper—not a breath! The sound that warns thy comrades nigh Shall sentence thee to death.” —Still, at the bayonet's point he stood, And strong to meet the blow; And shouted, 'midst his rushing blood, “Arm, arm, Auvergne! the foe!” The stir, the tramp, the bugle-call— He heard their tumults grow; And sent his dying voice through all— “Auvergne, Auvergne! the foe!” THE BURIAL OF WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR, AT CAEN IN NORMANDY—1087. Lowly upon his bier The royal conqueror lay; Baron and chief stood near, Silent in war-array. Down the long minster's aisle Crowds mutely gazing stream'd, Altar and tomb the while Through mists of incense gleam'd. And, by the torches' blaze, The stately priest had said High words of power and praise To the glory of the dead. They lower'd him, with the sound Of requiems, to repose; When from the throngs around A solemn voice arose:— “Forbear! forbear!” it cried, “In the holiest name forbear! He hath conquered regions wide, But he shall not slumber there! “By the violated hearth Which made way for yon proud shrine; By the harvests which this earth Hath borne for me and mine; “By the house e'en here o'erthrown, On my brethren's native spot; Hence! with his dark renown, Cumber our birthplace not! “Will my sire's unransom'd field, O'er which your censers wave, To the buried spoiler yield Soft slumbers in the grave? “The tree before him fell Which we cherish'd many a year, But its deep root yet shall swell, And heave against his bier. “The land that I have till'd Hath yet its brooding breast With my home's white ashes fill'd, And it shall not give him rest! “Each pillar's massy bed Hath been wet by weeping eyes— Away! bestow your dead Where no wrong against him cries.” —Shame glow'd on each dark face Of those proud and steel-girt men, And they bought with gold a place For their leader's dust e'en then. A little earth for him Whose banner flew so far! And a peasant's tale could dim The name, a nation's star! One deep voice thus arose From a heart which wrongs had riven: Oh! who shall number those That were but heard in heaven? END OF VOLUME SIXTH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. VII. TO MRS LAWRENCE OF WAVERTREE HALL, HER FRIEND, AND THE SISTER OF HER FRIEND COLONEL D'AGUILAR, THIS VOLUME IS AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED, IN REMEMBRANCE OF MANY BRIGHTLY ASSOCIATED HOURS, BY FELICIA HEMANS. LYRICS, AND SONGS FOR MUSIC. SONGS OF A GUARDIAN SPIRIT. I.—NEAR THEE, STILL NEAR THEE! This piece has been set to music of most impressive beauty by John Lodge, Esq., for whose compositions several of the author's songs were written. Near thee, still near thee!—o'er thy pathway gliding, Unseen I pass thee with the wind's low sigh; Life's veil enfolds thee still, our eyes dividing, Yet viewless love floats round thee silently! Not 'midst the festal throng, In halls of mirth and song; But when thy thoughts are deepest, When holy tears thou weepest, Know then that love is nigh! When the night's whisper o'er thy harp-strings creeping, Or the sea-music on the sounding shore, Or breezy anthems through the forest sweeping, Shall move thy trembling spirit to adore; When every thought and prayer We loved to breathe and share, On thy full heart returning, Shall wake its voiceless yearning; Then feel me near once more! Near thee, still near thee!—trust thy soul's deep dreaming! —Oh! love is not an earthly rose to die! Even when I soar where fiery stars are beaming, Thine image wanders with me through the sky. The fields of air are free; Yet lonely, wanting thee; But when thy chains are falling, When heaven its own is calling, Know then, thy guide is nigh! II.—OH! DROOP THOU NOT. “They sin who tell us love can die, With life all other passions fly; All others are but vanity. In heaven ambition cannot dwell, Nor avarice in the vaults of hell. Earthly these passions, as of earth— They perish where they drew their birth. But love is indestructible! Its holy flame for ever burneth; From heaven it came, to heaven returneth.” Southey. Oh! droop thou not, my gentle earthly love! Mine still to be! I bore through death, to brighter lands above, My thoughts of thee. Yes! the deep memory of our holy tears, Our mingled prayer, Our suffering love, through long devoted years, Went with me there, It was not vain, the hallow'd and the tried— It was not vain! Still, though unseen, still hovering at thy side, I watch again! From our own paths, our love's attesting bowers, I am not gone; In the deep calm of Midnight's whispering hours, Thou art not lone: Not lone, when by the haunted stream thou weepest, That stream whose tone Murmurs of thoughts, the richest and the deepest, We two have known: Not lone, when mournfully some strain awaking Of days long past, From thy soft eyes the sudden tears are breaking, Silent and fast: Not lone, when upwards, in fond visions turning Thy dreamy glance, Thou seek'st my home, where solemn stars are burning, O'er night's expanse. My home is near thee, loved one! and around thee, Where'er thou art; Though still mortality's thick cloud hath bound thee, Doubt not thy heart! Hear its low voice, nor deem thyself forsaken— Let faith be given To the still tones which oft our being waken— They are of heaven! THE SISTERS. This ballad was composed for a kind of dramatic recitative, relieved by music. It was thus performed by two graceful and highly accomplished sisters. A BALLAD. “I go, sweet sister; yet, my heart would linger with thee fain, And unto every parting gift some deep remembrance chain: Take then the braid of Eastern pearls which once I loved to wear, And with it bind for festal scenes the dark waves of thy hair! Its pale pure brightness will beseem those raven tresses well, And I shall need such pomp no more in my lone convent cell.” “Oh, speak not thus, my Leonor! why part from kindred love? Through festive scenes, when thou art gone—my steps no more shall move! How could I bear a lonely heart amid a reckless throng? I should but miss earth's dearest voice in every tone of song; Keep, keep the braid of Eastern pearls, or let me proudly twine Its wreath once more around that brow, that queenly brow of thine.” “Oh, would'st thou strive a wounded bird from shelter to detain? Or would'st thou call a spirit freed, to weary life again?— Sweet sister, take the golden cross that I have worn so long, And bathed with many a burning tear for secret woe and wrong. It could not still my beating heart! but may it be a sign Of peace and hope, my gentle one! when meekly press'd to thine!” “Take back, take back the cross of gold, our mother's gift to thee, It would but of this parting hour, a bitter token be; With funeral splendour to mine eye, it would but sadly shine, And tell of early treasures lost, of joy no longer mine! Oh sister! if thy heart be thus with buried grief oppress'd, Where would'st thou pour it forth so well, as on my faithful breast?” “Urge me no more! a blight hath fallen upon my summer years! I should but darken thy young life with fruitless pangs and fears; But take at least the lute I loved, and guard it for my sake, And sometimes from its silvery strings one tone of memory wake! Sing to those chords by starlight's gleam our own sweet vesper hymn, And think that I too chant it then, far in my cloister dim.” “Yes, I will take the silvery lute—and I will sing to thee A song we heard in childhood's days, even from our father's knee. Oh, sister, sister! are these notes amid forgotten things? Do they not linger as in love, on the familiar strings? Seems not our sainted mother's voice to murmur in the strain, Kind sister! gentlest Leonor! say shall it plead in vain?” SONG. “Leave us not, leave us not! Say not adieu! Have we not been to thee Tender and true? “Take not thy sunny smile Far from our hearth! With that sweet light will fade Summer and mirth. “Leave us not, leave us not! Can thy heart roam? Wilt thou not pine to hear Voices from home? “Too sad our love would be, If thou wert gone! Turn to us, leave us not! Thou art our own!” “Oh! sister, hush that thrilling lute, oh! cease that haunting lay, Too deeply pierce those wild sweet notes—yet, yet I cannot stay; For weary, weary is my heart! I hear a whisper'd call In every breeze that stirs the leaf and bids the blossom fall. I cannot breathe in freedom here, my spirit pines to dwell Where the world's voice can reach no more!—oh calm thee! Fare thee well!” THE LAST SONG OF SAPPHO. Sound on, thou dark unslumbering sea! My dirge is in thy moan; My spirit finds response in thee, To its own ceaseless cry—“Alone, alone!” Yet send me back one other word, Ye tones that never cease! Oh! let your secret caves be stirr'd, And say, dark waters! will ye give me peace? Away! my weary soul hath sought In vain one echoing sigh, One answer to consuming thought In human hearts—and will the wave reply? Sound on, thou dark unslumbering sea! Sound in thy scorn and pride! I ask not, alien world, from thee, What my own kindred earth hath still denied. And yet I loved that earth so well, With all its lovely things! —Was it for this the death-wind fell On my rich lyre, and quench'd its living strings? —Let them lie silent at my feet! Since broken even as they, The heart whose music made them sweet, Hath pour'd on desert-sands its wealth away, Yet glory's light hath touch'd my name, The laurel-wreath is mine— —With a lone heart, a weary frame— O restless deep! I come to make them thine! Give to that crown, that burning crown, Place in thy darkest hold! Bury my anguish, my renown, With hidden wrecks, lost gems, and wasted gold. Thou sea-bird on the billow's crest, Thou hast thy love, thy home; They wait thee in the quiet nest, And I, th' unsought, unwatch'd-for—I too come! I, with this winged nature fraught, These visions wildly free, This boundless love, this fiery thought— —Alone I come—oh! give me peace, dark sea! DIRGE. Where shall we make her grave? —Oh! where the wild-flowers wave In the free air! Where shower and singing-bird 'Midst the young leaves are heard— There—lay her there! Harsh was the world to her— Now may sleep minister Balm for each ill: Low on sweet nature's breast, Let the meek heart find rest, Deep, deep and still! Murmur, glad waters, by! Faint gales, with happy sigh, Come wandering o'er That green and mossy bed, Where, on a gentle head, Storms beat no more! What though for her in vain Falls now the bright spring-rain, Plays the soft wind? Yet still, from where she lies, Should blessed breathings rise, Gracious and kind. Therefore let song and dew Thence, in the heart renew Life's vernal glow! And o'er that holy earth Scents of the violet's birth Still come and go! Oh! then where wild-flowers wave, Make ye her mossy grave In the free air! Where shower and singing-bird 'Midst the young leaves are heard— There, lay her there! A SONG OF THE ROSE. “Cosi fior diverrai che non soggiace All 'acqua, al gelo, al vento ed allo scherno D'una stagion volubile e fugace; E a piu fido Cultor posto in governo, Unir potrai nella tranquilla pace, Ad eterna Bellezza odore eterno.” Pietro Metastasio. Rose! what dost thou here? Bridal, royal rose? How, 'midst grief and fear, Canst thou thus disclose That fervid hue of love, which to thy heart-leafglows? Rose! too much array'd For triumphal hours, Look'st thou through the shade Of these mortal bowers, Not to disturb my soul, thou crown'd one of all flowers! As an eagle soaring Through a sunny sky, As a clarion pouring Notes of victory, So dost thou kindle thoughts, for earthly life too high. Thoughts of rapture, flushing Youthful poet's cheek; Thoughts of glory, rushing Forth in song to break, But finding the spring-tide of rapid song too weak. Yet, oh, festal rose! I have seen thee lying In thy bright repose Pillow'd with the dying, Thy crimson by the lip whence life's quick blood was flying. Summer, hope, and love O'er that bed of pain, Met in thee, yet wove Too, too frail a chain In its embracing links the lovely to detain. Smilest thou, gorgeous flower? —Oh! within the spells Of thy beauty's power, Something dimly dwells, At variance with a world of sorrows and farewells. All the soul forth flowing In that rich perfume, All the proud life glowing In that radiant bloom,— Have they no place but here, beneath th' o'ershadowing tomb? Crown'st thou but the daughters Of our tearful race? —Heaven's own purest waters Well might wear the trace Of thy consummate form, melting to softer grace. Will that clime enfold thee With immortal air? Shall we not behold thee Bright and deathless there? In spirit-lustre clothed, transcendantly more fair? Yes! my fancy sees thee In that light disclose, And its dream thus frees thee From the mist of woes, Darkening thine earthly bowers, O bridal, royal rose! NIGHT-BLOWING FLOWERS. Children of night! unfolding meekly, slowly To the sweet breathings of the shadowy hours, When dark-blue heavens look softest and most holy, And glow-worm light is in the forest bowers; To solemn things and deep, To spirit-haunted sleep, To thoughts, all purified From earth, ye seem allied; O dedicated flowers! Ye, from the gaze of crowds your beauty veiling, Keep in dim vestal urns the sweetness shrined; Till the mild moon, on high serenely sailing, Looks on you tenderly and sadly kind. —So doth love's dreaming heart Dwell from the throng apart, And but to shades disclose The inmost thought which glows With its pure life entwined. Shut from the sounds wherein the day rejoices, To no triumphant song your petals thrill, But send forth odours with the faint soft voices Rising from hidden streams, when all is still. So doth lone prayer arise, Mingling with secret sighs, When grief unfolds, like you, Her breast, for heavenly dew In silent hours to fill. THE WANDERER AND THE NIGHT-FLOWERS. Call back your odours, lovely flowers, From the night-winds call them back; And fold your leaves till the laughing hours Come forth in the sunbeam's track! The lark lies couch'd in her grassy nest, And the honey bee is gone, And all bright things are away to rest, Why watch ye here alone? Is not your world a mournful one, When your sisters close their eyes, And your soft breath meets not a lingering tone Of song in the starry skies? Take ye no joy in the dayspring's birth, When it kindles the sparks of dew? And the thousand strains of the forest's mirth, Shall they gladden all but you? Shut your sweet bells till the fawn comes out On the sunny turf to play, And the woodland child with a fairy shout Goes dancing on its way! “Nay, let our shadowy beauty bloom When the stars give quiet light, And let us offer our faint perfume On the silent shrine of night. “Call it not wasted, the scent we lend To the breeze, when no step is nigh; Oh thus for ever the earth should send Her grateful breath on high! “And love us as emblems, night's dewy flowers, Of hopes unto sorrow given, That spring through the gloom of the darkest hours, Looking alone to heaven!” ECHO-SONG. In thy cavern-hall, Echo! art thou sleeping? By the fountain's fall Dreamy silence keeping? Yet one soft note borne From the shepherd's horn, Wakes thee, Echo! into music leaping! —Strange, sweet Echo! into music leaping Then the woods rejoice, Then glad sounds are swelling From each sister-voice Round thy rocky dwelling; And their sweetness fills All the hollow hills, With a thousand notes, of one life telling! —Softly mingled notes, of one life telling. Echo! in my heart Thus deep thoughts are lying, Silent and apart, Buried, yet undying. Till some gentle tone Wakening haply one, Calls a thousand forth, like thee replying! —Strange, sweet Echo! even like thee replying. This song is in the possession of Mr Power. THE MUFFLED DRUM. Set to beautiful music by John Lodge, Esq. The muffled drum was heard In the Pyrenees by night, With a dull deep rolling sound, Which told the hamlets round Of a soldier's burial rite. But it told them not how dear, In a home beyond the main, Was the warrior youth laid low that hour, By a mountain-stream of Spain. The oaks of England waved O'er the slumbers of his race, But a pine of the Ronceval made moan Above his last lone place; When the muffled drum was heard In the Pyrenees by night, With a dull deep rolling sound Which call'd strange echoes round To the soldier's burial rite. Brief was the sorrowing there, By the stream from battle red, And tossing on its wave the plumes Of many a stately head: But a mother—soon to die, And a sister—long to weep, Even then were breathing prayers for him, In that home beyond the deep; While the muffled drum was heard In the Pyrenees by night, With a dull deep rolling sound, And the dark pines mourn'd round, O'er the soldier's burial rite. THE SWAN AND THE SKYLARK. “Adieu, adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades Past the near meadows, over the still stream, Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep In the next valley-glades.” Keats. “Higher still and higher From the earth thou springest Like a cloud of fire; The blue deep thou wingest, And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.” Shelley. 'Midst the long reeds that o'er a Grecian stream Unto the faint wind sigh'd melodiously, And where the sculpture of a broken shrine Sent out thro' shadowy grass and thick wild-flowers Dim alabaster gleams—a lonely swan Warbled his death-chant; and a poet stood Listening to that strange music, as it shook The lilies on the wave; and made the pines And all the laurels of the haunted shore Thrill to its passion. Oh! the tones were sweet, Even painfully—as with the sweetness wrung From parting love; and to the poet's thought This was their language. “Summer, I depart! O light and laughing summer, fare thee well! No song the less through thy rich woods will swell, For one, one broken heart. “And fare ye well, young flowers! Ye will not mourn! ye will shed odour still, And wave in glory, colouring every rill, Known to my youth's fresh hours. “And ye, bright founts, that lie Far in the whispering forests, lone and deep, My wing no more shall stir your shadowy sleep— Sweet waters! I must die. “Will ye not send one tone Of sorrow through the pines?—one murmur low? Shall not the green leaves from your voices know That I, your child, am gone? “No, ever glad and free! Ye have no sounds a tale of death to tell, Waves, joyous waves, flow on, and fare ye well! Ye will not mourn for me. “But thou, sweet boon, too late Pour'd on my parting breath, vain gift of song! Why comest thou thus, o'ermastering, rich and strong, In the dark hour of fate? “Only to wake the sighs Of echo-voices from their sparry cell; Only to say—O sunshine and blue skies! O life and love, farewell!” Thus flow'd the death-chant on; while mournfully Low winds and waves made answer, and the tones Buried in rocks along the Grecian stream, Rocks and dim caverns of old Prophecy, Woke to respond: and all the air was fill'd With that one sighing sound—“Farewell, Farewell!” —Fill'd with that sound? high in the calm blue heaven Even then a skylark hung; soft summer clouds Were floating round him, all transpierced with light, And 'midst that pearly radiance his dark wings Quiver'd with song:—such free triumphant song, As if tears were not,—as if breaking hearts Had not a place below—and thus that strain Spoke to the Poet's ear exultingly. “The summer is come; she hath said, ‘Rejoice!’ The wild woods thrill to her merry voice; Her sweet breath is wandering around, on high; Sing, sing through the echoing sky! “There is joy in the mountains; the bright waves leap, Like the bounding stag when he breaks from sleep; Mirthfully, wildly, they flash along— —Let the heavens ring with song! “There is joy in the forests; the bird of night Hath made the leaves tremble with deep delight; But mine is the glory to sunshine given— Sing, sing through the echoing heaven! “Mine are the wings of the soaring morn, Mine are the fresh gales with dayspring born: Only young rapture can mount so high— —Sing, sing through the echoing sky!” So those two voices met; so Joy and Death Mingled their accents; and amidst the rush Of many thoughts, the listening poet cried,— “Oh! thou art mighty, thou art wonderful, Mysterious Nature! Not in thy free range Of woods and wilds alone, thou blendest thus The dirge-note and the song of festival; But in one heart, one changeful human heart— Ay, and within one hour of that strange world— Thou call'st their music forth, with all its tones To startle and to pierce!—the dying swan's, And the glad skylark's—triumph and despair!” SONGS OF SPAIN. Written for a set of airs, entitled Peninsular Melodies, selected by Colonel Hodges, and published by Messrs Goulding and D'Almaine, who have permitted the reappearance of the words in this volume. I.—ANCIENT BATTLE SONG. Fling forth the proud banner of Leon again! Let the high word “Castile!” go resounding through Spain! And thou, free Asturias, encamp'd on the height, Pour down thy dark sons to the vintage of fight! Wake, wake! the old soil where thy children repose Sounds hollow and deep to the trampling of foes! The voices are mighty that swell from the past, With Arragon's cry on the shrill mountain blast; The ancient sierras give strength to our tread, Their pines murmur song where bright blood hath been shed. —Fling forth the proud banner of Leon again, And shout ye “Castile! to the rescue for Spain!” II.—THE ZEGRI MAID. The summer leaves were sighing Around the Zegri maid, To her low sad song replying As it fill'd the olive shade. “Alas! for her that loveth Her land's, her kindred's foe! Where a Christian Spaniard roveth, Should a Zegri's spirit go? “From thy glance, my gentle mother! I sink, with shame oppress'd, And the dark eye of my brother Is an arrow to my breast.” —Where summer leaves were sighing Thus sang the Zegri maid, While the crimson day was dying In the whispery olive shade. “And for all this heart's wealth wasted, This woe in secret borne, This flower of young life blasted, Should I win back aught but scorn? By aught but daily dying Would my lone truth be repaid?” —Where the olive leaves were sighing, Thus sang the Zegri maid. III.—THE RIO VERDE SONG. Flow, Rio Verde! In melody flow; Win her that weepeth To slumber from woe; Bid thy wave's music Roll through her dreams, Grief ever loveth The kind voice of streams. Bear her lone spirit Afar on the sound Back to her childhood, Her life's fairy ground; Pass like the whisper Of love that is gone— Flow, Rio Verde! Softly flow on! Dark glassy water So crimson'd of yore! Love, death, and sorrow Know thy green shore. Thou should'st have echoes For grief's deepest tone— Flow, Rio Verde, Softly flow on! IV.—SEEK BY THE SILVERY DARRO. Seek by the silvery Darro, Where jasmine flowers have blown; There hath she left no footsteps? —Weep, weep, the maid is gone! Seek where our lady's image Smiles o'er the pine-hung steep; Hear ye not there her vespers? —Weep for the parted, weep! Seek in the porch where vine-leaves O'ershade her father's head? —Are his grey hairs left lonely? —Weep! her bright soul is fled. V.—SPANISH EVENING HYMN. Ave! now let prayer and music Meet in love on earth and sea! Now, sweet Mother! may the weary Turn from this cold world to thee! From the wide and restless waters Hear the sailor's hymn arise? From his watch-fire 'midst the mountains, Lo! to thee the shepherd cries! Yet, when thus full hearts find voices, If o'erburden'd souls there be, Dark and silent in their anguish, Aid those captives! set them free! Touch them, every fount unsealing, Where the frozen tears lie deep; Thou, the Mother of all sorrows, Aid, oh! aid to pray and weep! VI.—BIRD, THAT ART SINGING ON EBRO'S SIDE. Bird, that art singing on Ebro's side! Where myrtle shadows make dim the tide, Doth sorrow dwell 'midst the leaves with thee? Doth song avail thy full heart to free? —Bird of the midnight's purple sky! Teach me the spell of thy melody. Bird! is it blighted affection's pain, Whence the sad sweetness flows through thy strain? And is the wound of that arrow still'd, When thy lone music the leaves hath fill'd? —Bird of the midnight's purple sky! Teach me the spell of thy melody. VII.—MOORISH GATHERING SONG. ZORZICO. The Zorzico is an extremely wild and singular antique Moorish melody. Chains on the cities! gloom in the air! Come to the hills! fresh breezes are there. Silence and fear in the rich orange bowers! Come to the rocks where freedom hath towers. Come from the Darro!—changed is its tone; Come where the streams no bondage have known; Wildly and proudly foaming they leap, Singing of freedom from steep to steep. Come from Alhambra! garden and grove Now may not shelter beauty or love. Blood on the waters, death 'midst the flowers! —Only the spear and the rock are ours. VIII.—THE SONG OF MINA'S SOLDIERS. We heard thy name, O Mina! Far through our hills it rang; A sound more strong than tempests, More keen than armour's clang. The peasant left his vintage, The shepherd grasp'd the spear— —We heard thy name, O Mina! The mountain bands are here. As eagles to the dayspring, As torrents to the sea, From every dark sierra So rush'd our hearts to thee. Thy spirit is our banner, Thine eye our beacon-sign, Thy name our trumpet, Mina! —The mountain bands are thine. IX.—MOTHER, OH! SING ME TO REST. A CANCION. Mother! oh, sing me to rest As in my bright days departed: Sing to thy child, the sick-hearted, Songs for a spirit oppress'd. Lay this tired head on thy breast! Flowers from the night-dew are closing Pilgrims and mourners reposing— —Mother, oh, sing me to rest! Take back thy bird to its nest! Weary is young life when blighted, Heavy this love unrequited;— —Mother, oh! sing me to rest! X.—THERE ARE SOUNDS IN THE DARK RONCESVALLES. There are sounds in the dark Roncesvalles, There are echoes on Biscay's wild shore; There are murmurs—but not of the torrent, Nor the wind, nor the pine-forest's roar. 'Tis a day of the spear and the banner, Of armings and hurried farewells; Rise, rise on your mountains, ye Spaniards; Or start from your old battle-dells. There are streams of unconquer'd Asturias, That have roll'd with your father's free blood; Oh! leave on the graves of the mighty, Proud marks where their children have stood! THE CURFEW-SONG OF ENGLAND. Hark! from the dim church tower, The deep slow curfew's chime! —A heavy sound unto hall and bower In England's olden time! Sadly 'twas heard by him who came From the fields of his toil at night, And who might not see his own hearth-flame In his children's eyes make light. Sternly and sadly heard, As it quench'd the wood-fire's glow, Which had cheer'd the board with the mirthful word, And the red wine's foaming flow! Until that sullen boding knell Flung out from every fane, On harp, and lip, and spirit, fell, With a weight and with a chain. Woe for the pilgrim then, In the wild deer's forest far! No cottage-lamp, to the haunts of men, Might guide him, as a star. And woe for him whose wakeful soul, With lone aspirings fill'd, Would have lived o'er some immortal scroll, While the sounds of earth were still'd! And yet a deeper woe For the watcher by the bed, Where the fondly loved in pain lay low, In pain and sleepless dread! For the mother, doom'd unseen to keep By the dying babe, her place, And to feel its flitting pulse, and weep, Yet not behold its face! Darkness in chieftain's hall! Darkness in peasant's cot! While freedom, under that shadowy pall, Sat mourning o'er her lot. Oh! the fireside's peace we well may prize! For blood hath flow'd like rain, Pour'd forth to make sweet sanctuaries Of England's homes again. Heap the yule-fagots high Till the red light fills the room! It is home's own hour when the stormy sky Grows thick with evening-gloom. Gather ye round the holy hearth, And by its gladdening blaze, Unto thankful bliss we will change our mirth, With a thought of the olden days! THE CALL TO BATTLE. “Ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro, And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress, And there were sudden partings, such as press The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs, Which ne'er might be repeated.” Byron. The vesper-bell, from church and tower, Had sent its dying sound; And the household, in the hush of eve, Were met, their porch around. A voice rang through the olive-wood, with a sudden trumpet's power— “We rise on all our hills! come forth! 'tis thy country's gathering hour— There's a gleam of spears by every stream, in each old battle-dell— Come forth, young Juan! bid thy home a brief and proud farewell!” Then the father gave his son the sword, Which a hundred fights had seen— “Away! and bear it back, my boy! All that it still hath been! “Haste, haste! the hunters of the foe are up, and who shall stand The lion-like awakening of the roused indignant land? Our chase shall sound through each defile where swept the clarion's blast, With the flying footsteps of the Moor in stormy ages past.” Then the mother kiss'd her son with tears That o'er his dark locks fell: “I bless, I bless thee o'er and o'er, Yet I stay thee not—Farewell!” “One moment! but one moment give to parting thought or word! It is no time for woman's tears when manhood's heart is stirred. Bear but the memory of thy love about thee in the fight, To breathe upon th' avenging sword a spell of keener might. And a maiden's fond adieu was heard, Though deep, yet brief and low: “In the vigil, in the conflict, love! My prayer shall with thee go!” “Come forth! come as the torrent comes when the winter's chain is burst! So rushes on the land's revenge, in night and silence nursed— The night is past, the silence o'er—on all our hills we rise— We wait thee, youth! sleep, dream no more! the voice of battle cries.” There were sad hearts in a darken'd home, When the brave had left their bower; But the strength of prayer and sacrifice Was with them in that hour. SONGS FOR SUMMER HOURS. Of these songs, the ones entitled, “Ye are not missed, fair Flowers,” the “Willow Song,” “Leave me not yet,” and the “Orange Bough,” are in the possession of Mr Willis, by whom they will be published with music. I.—AND I TOO IN ARCADIA. They have wander'd in their glee With the butterfly and bee; They have climb'd o'er heathery swells, They have wound through forest dells; Mountain moss hath felt their tread, Woodland streams their way have led; Flowers, in deepest shadowy nooks, Nurslings of the loneliest brooks, Unto them have yielded up Fragrant bell and starry cup: Chaplets are on every brow— What hath staid the wand'rers now? Lo! a grey and rustic tomb, Bower'd amidst the rich wood gloom; Whence these words their stricken spirits melt, —“I too, Shepherds! in Arcadia dwelt.” There is many a summer sound That pale sepulchre around; Through the shade young birds are glancing, Insect-wings in sun-streaks dancing; Glimpses of blue festal skies Pouring in when soft winds rise; Violets o'er the turf below Shedding out their warmest glow; Yet a spirit not its own O'er the greenwood now is thrown! Something of an under-note Through its music seems to float, Something of a stillness grey Creeps across the laughing day: Something, dimly from those old words felt, —“I too, Shepherds! in Arcadia dwelt.” Was some gentle kindred maid In that grave with dirges laid? Some fair creature, with the tone Of whose voice a joy is gone, Leaving melody and mirth Poorer on this alter'd earth? Is it thus? that so they stand, Dropping flowers from every hand? Flowers, and lyres, and gather'd store Of red wild-fruit prized no more? —No! from that bright band of morn, Not one link hath yet been torn; 'Tis the shadow of the tomb Falling o'er the summer-bloom, O'er the flush of love and life Passing with a sudden strife; 'Tis the low prophetic breath Murmuring from that house of death, Whose faint whisper thus their hearts can melt, “I too, Shepherds! in Arcadia dwelt.” II.—THE WANDERING WIND. The Wind, the wandering Wind Of the golden summer eves— Whence is the thrilling magic Of its tones amongst the leaves? Oh! is it from the waters, Or from the long tall grass? Or is it from the hollow rocks Through which its breathings pass? Or is it from the voices Of all in one combined, That it wins the tone of mastery? The Wind, the wandering Wind! No, no! the strange, sweet accents That with it come and go, They are not from the osiers, Nor the fir-trees whispering low. They are not of the waters, Nor of the cavern'd hill: 'Tis the human love within us That gives them power to thrill, They touch the links of memory Around our spirits twined, And we start, and weep, and tremble, To the wind, the Wandering Wind! III.—YE ARE NOT MISS'D, FAIR FLOWERS. Ye are not miss'd, fair flowers, that late were spreading The summer's glow by fount and breezy grot; There falls the dew, its fairy favours shedding, The leaves dance on, the young birds miss you not. Still plays the sparkle o'er the rippling water, O lily! whence thy cup of pearl is gone; The bright wave mourns not for its loveliest daughter, There is no sorrow in the wind's low tone. And thou, meeek hyacinth! afar is roving The bee that oft thy trembling bells hath kiss'd; Cradled ye were, fair flowers! 'midst all things loving, A joy to all—yet, yet, ye are not miss'd! Ye, that were born to lend the sunbeam gladness, And the winds fragrance, wandering where they list, Oh! it were breathing words too deep in sadness, To say—earth's human flowers not more are miss'd. IV.—WILLOW SONG. Willow! in thy breezy moan, I can hear a deeper tone; Through thy leaves come whispering low Faint sweet sounds of long ago. Willow, sighing willow! Many a mournful tale of old Heart-sick love to thee hath told, Gathering from thy golden bough Leaves to cool his burning brow. Willow, sighing willow! Many a swan-like song to thee Hath been sung, thou gentle tree! Many a lute its last lament Down thy moonlight stream hath sent: Willow, sighing willow! Therefore, wave and murmur on! Sigh for sweet affections gone, And for tuneful voices fled, And for love, whose heart hath bled, Ever, willow, willow! V.—LEAVE ME NOT YET. Leave me not yet—through rosy skies from far, But now the song-birds to their nests return; The quivering image of the first pale star On the dim lake scarce yet begins to burn: Leave me not yet! Not yet!—oh, hark! low tones from hidden streams, Piercing the shivery leaves, even now arise; Their voices mingle not with daylight dreams, They are of vesper's hymns and harmonies: Leave me not yet! My thoughts are like those gentle sounds, dear love! By day shut up in their own still recess, They wait for dews on earth, for stars above, Then to breathe out their soul of tenderness: Leave me not yet! VI.—THE ORANGE BOUGH. Oh! bring me one sweet orange-bough, To fan my cheek, to cool my brow; One bough, with pearly blossoms drest, And bind it, mother! on my breast! Go, seek the grove along the shore, Whose odours I must breathe no more; The grove where every scented tree Thrills to the deep voice of the sea. Oh! Love's fond sighs, and fervent prayer, And wild farewell, are lingering there: Each leaf's light whisper hath a tone, My faint heart, even in death, would own. Then bear me thence one bough, to shed Life's parting sweetness round my head, And bind it, mother! on my breast When I am laid in lonely rest. VII.—THE STREAM SET FREE. Flow on, rejoice, make music, Bright living stream set free! The troubled haunts of care and strife Were not for thee! The woodland is thy country, Thou art all its own again; The wild birds are thy kindred race, That fear no chain. Flow on, rejoice, make music Unto the glistening leaves! Thou, the beloved of balmy winds, And golden eves. Once more the holy starlight Sleeps calm upon thy breast, Whose brightness bears no token more Of man's unrest. Flow, and let freeborn music Flow with thy wavy line, While the stock-dove's lingering, loving voice Comes blent with thine. And the green reeds quivering o'er thee, Strings of the forest-lyre, All fill'd with answering spirit-sounds, In joy respire. Yet, 'midst thy song's glad changes, Oh! keep one pitying tone For gentle hearts, that bear to thee Their sadness lone. One sound, of all the deepest, To bring, like healing dew, A sense, that nature ne'er forsakes The meek and true. Then, then, rejoice, make music, Thou stream, thou glad and free! The shadows of all glorious flowers Be set in thee! VIII.—THE SUMMER'S CALL. Come away! the sunny hours Woo thee far to founts and bowers! O'er the very waters now, In there play, Flowers are shedding beauty's glow— Come away! Where the lily's tender gleam Quivers on the glancing stream— Come away! All the air is filled with sound, Soft, and sultry, and profound; Murmurs through the shadowy grass Lightly stray; Faint winds whisper as they pass— Come away; Where the bee's deep music swells From the trembling foxglove bells— Come away! In the skies the sapphire blue Now hath won its richest hue; In the woods the breath of song Night and day Floats with leafy scents along— Come away! Where the boughs with dewy gloom Darken each thick bed of bloom— Come away! In the deep heart of the rose Now the crimson love-hue glows; Now the glow-worm's lamp by night Sheds a ray, Dreamy, starry, greenly bright— Come away! Where the fairy cup-moss lies, With the wild-wood strawberries, Come away! Now each tree by summer crown'd, Sheds its own rich twilight round; Glancing there from sun to shade, Bright wings play; There the deer its couch hath made— Come away! Where the smooth leaves of the lime Glisten in their honey-time— Come away—away! IX.—OH! SKYLARK, FOR THY WING. Oh! Skylark, for thy wing! Thou bird of joy and light, That I might soar and sing At heaven's empyreal height! With the heathery hills beneath me, Whence the streams in glory spring, And the pearly clouds to wreath me, Oh, Skylark! on thy wing! Free, free from earth-born fear, I would range the blessed skies, Through the blue divinely clear, Where the low mists cannot rise! And a thousand joyous measures From my chainless heart should spring, Like the bright rain's vernal treasures, As I wander'd on thy wing. But oh! the silver chords, That around the heart are spun, From gentle tones and words, And kind eyes that make our sun! To some low sweet nest returning, How soon my love would bring, There, there the dews of morning, Oh, Skylark! on thy wing! GENIUS SINGING TO LOVE. “That voice re-measures Whatever tones and melancholy pleasures The things of nature utter; birds or trees, Or where the tall grass 'mid the heath-plant waves, Murmur and music thin of sudden breeze.” Coleridge. I heard a song upon the wandering wind, A song of many tones—though one full soul Breathed through them all imploringly; and made All nature as they pass'd, all quivering leaves And low responsive reeds and waters thrill, As with the consciousness of human prayer. —At times the passion-kindled melody Might seem to gush from Sappho's fervent heart, Over the wild sea-wave;—at times the strain Flow'd with more plaintive sweetness, as if born Of Petrarch's voice, beside the lone Vaucluse; And sometimes, with its melancholy swell, A graver sound was mingled, a deep note Of Tasso's holy lyre;—yet still the tones Were of a suppliant;—“Leave me not!” was still The burden of their music; and I knew The lay which Genius, in its loneliness, Its own still world amidst th' o'erpeopled world, Hath ever breathed to Love. They crown me with the glistening crown, Borne from a deathless tree; I hear the pealing music of renown— O Love! forsake me not! Mine were a lone dark lot, Bereft of thee! They tell me that my soul can throw A glory o'er the earth; From thee, from thee, is caught that golden glow! Shed by thy gentle eyes It gives to flower and skies, A bright new birth! Thence gleams the path of morning, Over the kindling hills, a sunny zone! Thence to its heart of hearts the rose is burning With lustre not its own! Thence every wood-recess Is filled with loveliness, Each bower, to ring-doves and dim violets known. I see all beauty by the ray That streameth from thy smile; Oh! bear it, bear it not away! Can that sweet light beguile? Too pure, too spirit-like, it seems, To linger long by earthly streams; I clasp it with th' alloy Of fear 'midst quivering joy, Yet must I perish if the gift depart— Leave me not, Love! to mine own beating heart! The music from my lyre With thy swift step would flee; The world's cold breath would quench the starry fire In my deep soul—a temple fill'd with thee! Seal'd would the fountains lie, The waves of harmony, Which thou alone canst free! Like a shrine 'midst rocks forsaken, Whence the oracle hath fled; Like a harp which none might waken But a mighty master dead; Like the vase of a perfume scatter'd, Such would my spirit be; So mute, so void, so shatter'd, Bereft of thee! Leave me not, Love! or if this earth Yield not for thee a home, If the bright summer-land of thy pure birth Send thee a silvery voice that whispers—“Come!” Then, with the glory from the rose, With the sparkle from the stream, With the light thy rainbow-presence throws Over the poet's dream; With all th' Elysian hues Thy pathway that suffuse, With joy, with music, from the fading grove, Take me, too, heavenward, on thy wing, sweet Love MUSIC AT A DEATHBED. “Music! why thy power employ Only for the sons of joy? Only for the smiling guests At natal, or at nuptial feasts? Rather thy lenient numbers pour On those whom secret griefs devour; And with some softly-whisper'd air Smooth the brow of dumb despair!” Warton from Euripides. Bring music! stir the brooding air With an ethereal breath! Bring sounds, my struggling soul to bear Up from the couch of death! A voice, a flute, a dreamy lay, Such as the southern breeze Might waft, at golden fall of day, O'er blue transparent seas! Oh no! not such! that lingering spell Would lure me back to life, When my wean'd heart hath said farewell, And pass'd the gates of strife. Let not a sigh of human love Blend with the song its tone! Let no disturbing echo move One that must die alone! But pour a solemn-breathing strain Fill'd with the soul of prayer; Let a life's conflict, fear, and pain, And trembling hope be there. Deeper, yet deeper! in my thought Lies more prevailing sound, A harmony intensely fraught With pleading more profound: A passion unto music given, A sweet, yet piercing cry: A breaking heart's appeal to Heaven, A bright faith's victory! Deeper! Oh! may no richer power Be in those notes enshrined? Can all, which crowds on earth's last hour, No fuller language find? Away! and hush the feeble song, And let the chord be still'd! Far in another land erelong My dream shall be fulfill'd. MARSHAL SCHWERIN'S GRAVE. Thou didst fall in the field with thy silver hair, And a banner in thy hand; Thou wert laid to rest from thy battles there, By a proudly mournful band. In the camp, on the steed, to the bugle's blast, Thy long bright years had sped; And a warrior's bier was thine at last, When the snows had crown'd thy head, Many had fallen by thy side, old chief! Brothers and friends, perchance; But thou wert yet as the fadeless leaf, And light was in thy glance. The soldier's heart at thy step leap'd high, And thy voice the war-horse knew; And the first to arm, when the foe was nigh, Wert thou, the bold and true. Now may'st thou slumber—thy work is done— Thou of the well-worn sword! From the stormy fight in thy fame thou'rt gone, But not to the festal board. The corn sheaves whisper thy grave around, Where fiery blood hath flow'd: Oh! lover of battle and trumpet-sound! Thou art couch'd in a still abode! A quiet home from the noonday's glare, And the breath of the wintry blast— Didst thou toil through the days of thy silvery hair, To win thee but this at last? THE FALLEN LIME-TREE. Oh, joy of the peasant! O stately lime! Thou art fall'n in thy golden honey-time. Thou whose wavy shadows, Long and long ago, Screen'd our grey forefathers From the noontide's glow; Thou, beneath whose branches, Touch'd with moonlight gleams, Lay our early poets, Wrapt in fairy dreams. O tree of our fathers! O hallow'd tree! A glory is gone from our home with thee. Where shall now the weary Rest through summer eves? Or the bee find honey, As on thy sweet leaves? Where shall now the ringdove Build again her nest? She so long the inmate Of thy fragrant breast? But the sons of the peasant have lost in thee Far more than the ringdove, far more than the bee! These may yet find coverts Leafy and profound, Full of dewy dimness, Odour and soft sound: But the gentle memories Clinging all to thee, When shall they be gather'd Round another tree? O pride of our fathers! O hallow'd tree! The crown of the hamlet is fallen in thee! SONGS OF CAPTIVITY. INTRODUCTION. One hour for distant homes to weep 'Midst Afric's burning sands, One silent sunset hour was given To the slaves of many lands. They sat beneath a lonely palm, In the gardens of their lord; And mingling with the fountain's tune, Their songs of exile pour'd. And strangely, sadly, did those lays Of Alp and ocean sound, With Afric's wild red skies above, And solemn wastes around. Broken with tears were oft their tones, And most when most they tried To breathe of hope and liberty, From hearts that inly died. So met the sons of many lands, Parted by mount and main; So did they sing in brotherhood, Made kindred by the chain. I.—THE BROTHER'S DIRGE. In the proud old fanes of England My warrior-fathers lie, Banners hang drooping o'er their dust With gorgeous blazonry. But thou, but thou, my brother! O'er thee dark billows sweep, The best and bravest heart of all Is shrouded by the deep. In the old high wars of England My noble fathers bled; For her lion-kings of lance and spear, They went down to the dead. But thou, but thou, my brother! Thy life-drops flow'd for me— Would I were with thee in thy rest, Young sleeper of the sea. In a shelter'd home of England Our sister dwells alone, With quick heart listening for the sound Of footsteps that are gone, She little dreams, my brother! Of the wild fate we have found; I, 'midst the Afric sands a slave, Thou, by the dark seas bound. II.—THE ALPINE HORN. The Alpine horn! the Alpine horn! Oh! through my native sky, Might I but hear its deep notes borne Once more—but once—and die! Yet, no! 'midst breezy hills thy breath, So full of hope and morn, Would win me from the bed of death— O joyous Alpine horn! But here the echo of that blast, To many a battle known, Seems mournfully to wander past, A wild, shrill, wailing tone! Haunt me no more! for slavery's air Thy proud notes were not born; The dream but deepens my despair— Be hush'd, thou Alpine horn! III.—O YE VOICES. O ye voices round my own hearth singing! As the winds of May to memory sweet, Might I yet return, a worn heart bringing, Would those vernal tones the wanderer greet, Once again? Never, never! Spring hath smiled and parted Oft since then your fond farewell was said; O'er the green turf of the gentle-hearted Summer's hand the rose-leaves may have shed, Oft again! Or if still around my heart ye linger, Yet, sweet voices! there must change have come Years have quell'd the free soul of the singer, Vernal tones shall greet the wanderer home, Ne'er again! IV.—I DREAM OF ALL THINGS FREE. I dream of all things free! Of a gallant, gallant bark, That sweeps through storm and sea, Like an arrow to its mark! Of a stag that o'er the hills Goes bounding in his glee; Of a thousand flashing rills— Of all things glad and free. I dream of some proud bird, A bright-eyed mountain king! In my visions I have heard The rushing of his wing. I follow some wild river, On whose breast no sail may be; Dark woods around it shiver— —I dream of all things free! Of a happy forest child, With the fawns and flowers at play; Of an Indian 'midst the wild, With the stars to guide his way: Of a chief his warriors leading, Of an archer's greenwood tree:— My heart in chains is bleeding, And I dream of all things free! V.—FAR O'ER THE SEA. Where are the vintage songs Wandering in glee? Where dance the peasant bands Joyous and free? Under a kind blue sky, Where doth my birthplace lie? —Far o'er the sea. Where floats the myrtle-scent O'er vale and lea, When evening calls the dove Homewards to flee? Where doth the orange gleam Soft on my native stream? —Far o'er the sea! Where are sweet eyes of love Watching for me? Where o'er the cabin roof Waves the green tree? Where speaks the vesper-chime Still of a holy time? —Far o'er the sea. Dance on, ye vintage bands, Fearless and free! Still fresh and greenly wave, My father's tree! Still smile, ye kind blue skies! Though your son pines and dies Far o'er the sea! VI.—THE INVOCATION. Oh! art thou still on earth, my love? My only love! Or smiling in a brighter home, Far, far above? Oh! is thy sweet voice fled, my love? Thy light step gone? And art thou not, in earth or heaven, Still, still my own? I see thee with thy gleaming hair. In midnight dreams! But cold, and clear, and spirit-like, Thy soft eye seems. Peace in thy saddest hour, my love! Dwelt on thy brow; But something mournfully divine There shineth now! And silent ever is thy lip, And pale thy cheek;— Oh! art thou earth's, or art thou heaven's, Speak to me, speak! VII.—THE SONG OF HOPE. Droop not, my brothers! I hear a glad strain— We shall burst forth like streams from the winter night's chain; A flag is unfurl'd, a bright star of the sea, A ransom approaches—we yet shall be free! Where the pines wave, where the light chamois leaps, Where the lone eagle hath built on the steeps; Where the snows glisten, the mountain-rills foam, Free as the falcon's wing, yet shall we roam. Where the hearth shines, where the kind looks are met, Where the smiles mingle, our place shall be yet! Crossing the desert, o'ersweeping the sea— Droop not, my Brothers! we yet shall be free! THE BIRD AT SEA. Bird of the greenwood! Oh! why art thou here? Leaves dance not o'er thee, Flowers bloom not near. All the sweet waters Far hence are at play— Bird of the greenwood! Away, away! Where the mast quivers, Thy place will not be, As 'midst the waving Of wild rose and tree. How should'st thou battle With storm and with spray? Bird of the greenwood! Away, away! Or art thou seeking Some brighter land, Where by the south wind Vine leaves are fann'd? 'Midst the wild billows Why then delay? Bird of the greenwood! Away, away! “Chide not my lingering Where storms are dark; A hand that hath nursed me Is in the bark; A heart that hath cherish'd Through winter's long day, So I turn from the greenwood, Away, away!” THE DYING GIRL AND FLOWERS. “I desire as I look on these, the ornaments and children of earth, to know whether, indeed, such things I shall see no more?—whether they have no likeness, no archetype in the world in which my future home is to be cast? or whether they have their images above, only wrought in a more wondrous and delightful mould.” Conversations with an ambitious Student in ill health. Bear them not from grassy dells Where wild bees have honey-cells; Not from where sweet water-sounds Thrill the greenwood to its bounds; Not to waste their scented breath On the silent room of Death! Kindred to the breeze they are, And the glow-worm's emerald star, And the bird, whose song is free And the many-whispering tree: Oh! too deep a love, and vain, They would win to earth again. Spread them not before the eyes, Closing fast on summer skies! Woo thou not the spirit back, From its lone and viewless track, With the bright things which have birth Wide o'er all the colour'd earth! With the violet's breath would rise Thoughts too sad for her who dies; From the lily's pearl-cup shed, Dreams too sweet would haunt her bed; Dreams of youth—of spring-time eves— Music—beauty—all she leaves! Hush! 'tis thou that dreaming art, Calmer is her gentle heart. Yes! o'er fountain, vale, and grove, Leaf and flower hath gush'd her love; But that passion, deep and true, Knows not of a last adieu. Types of lovelier forms than these, In their fragile mould she sees; Shadows of yet richer things, Born beside immortal springs, Into fuller glory wrought, Kindled by surpassing thought! Therefore, in the lily's leaf, She can read no word of grief; O'er the woodbine she can dwell, Murmuring not—Farewell! farewell! And her dim, yet speaking eye, Greets the violet solemnly. Therefore once, and yet again, Strew them o'er her bed of pain; From her chamber take the gloom With a light and flush of bloom: So should one depart, who goes Where no death can touch the rose! THE IVY-SONG. This song, as originally written, the reader will have met with in an earlier part of this publication. Being afterwards completely remodelled by Mrs Hemans, perhaps no apology is requisite for its re-insertion here. Oh! how could fancy crown with thee, In ancient days, the God of Wine, And bid thee at the banquet be Companion of the Vine? Ivy! thy home is where each sound Of revelry hath long been o'er, Where song and beaker once went round, But now are known no more, Where long-fallen gods recline, There the place is thine. The Roman, on his battle-plains, Where kings before his eagles bent, With thee, amidst exulting strains, Shadow'd the victors tent: Though shining there in deathless green, Triumphally thy boughs might wave, Better thou lovest the silent scene Around the victor's grave— Urn and sculpture half divine Yield their place to thine. The cold halls of the regal dead, Where lone the Italian sunbeams dwell, Where hollow sounds the lightest tread— Ivy! they know thee well! And far above the festal vine, Thou wavest where once-proud banners hung, Where mouldering turrets crest the Rhine, —The Rhine, still fresh and young! Tower and rampart o'er the Rhine, Ivy! all are thine! High from the fields of air look down— Those eyries of a vanish'd race, Where harp, and battle, and renown, Have pass'd, and left no trace. But thou art there!—serenely bright, Meeting the mountain storms with bloom, Thou that wilt climb the loftiest height, Or crown the lowliest tomb! Ivy, Ivy! all are thine, Palace, hearth, and shrine. 'Tis still the same; our pilgrim tread O'er classic plains, through deserts free, On the mute path of ages fled, Still meets decay and thee. And still let man his fabrics rear, August in beauty, stern in power, —Days pass—thou Ivy never sere, “Ye myrtles brown, and ivy never sere.”—Lycidas. And thou shalt have thy dower. All are thine, or must be thine— Temple, pillar, shrine! THE MUSIC OF ST PATRICK'S. “All the choir Sang Hallelujah, as the sound of seas.” Milton. Again! oh, send that anthem peal again Through the arch'd roof in triumph to the sky! Bid the old tombs ring proudly to the strain, The banners thrill as if with victory! Such sounds the warrior awestruck might have heard, While arm'd for fields of chivalrous renown: Such the high hearts of kings might well have stirr'd, While throbbing still beneath the recent crown! Those notes once more!—they bear my soul away, They lend the wings of morning to its flight; No earthly passion in th' exulting lay, Whispers one tone to win me from that height. All is of Heaven!—Yet wherefore to mine eye Gush the vain tears unbidden from their source? Even while the waves of that strong harmony Roll with my spirit on their sounding course! Wherefore must rapture its full heart reveal Thus by the burst of sorrow's token-shower? —Oh! is it not, that humbly we may feel Our nature's limit in its proudest hour? KEENE, OR LAMENT OF AN IRISH MOTHER OVER HER SON. Darkly the cloud of night comes rolling on; Darker is thy repose, my fair-hair'd son! Silent and dark! There is blood upon the threshold Whence thy step went forth at morn, Like a dancer's in its fleetness, Oh, my bright first-born! At the glad sound of that footstep, My heart within me smiled; —Thou wert brought me back all silent On thy bier, my child! Darkly the cloud of night comes rolling on; Darker is thy repose, my fair-hair'd son! Silent and dark! I thought to see thy children Laugh on me with thine eyes; But my sorrow's voice is lonely Where my life's flower lies. I shall go to sit beside thee, Thy kindred's graves among; I shall hear the tall grass whisper— I shall hear it not long! Darkly the cloud of night comes rolling on; Darker is thy repose, my fair-hair'd son! Silent and dark! And I too shall find slumber With my lost one, in the earth; —Let none light up the ashes Again on our hearth! Let the roof go down!—let silence On the home for ever fall, Where my boy lay cold, and heard not His lone mother's call! Darkly the cloud of night comes rolling on; Darker is thy repose, my fair-hair'd son! Silent and dark! FAR AWAY. This, and the five following songs, have been set to music of great merit, by J. Zeugheer Herrmann, and H. F. C., and are published in a set by Mr Power, who has given permission for the appearance of the words in this volume. Far away!—my home is far away, Where the blue sea laves a mountain shore; In the woods I hear my brothers play, 'Midst the flowers my sister sings once more. Far away! Far away! my dreams are far away, When at midnight, stars and shadows reign; “Gentle child,” my mother seems to say, “Follow me where home shall smile again!” Far away! Far away! my hope is far away, Where love's voice young gladness may restore; —O thou dove! now soaring through the day, Lend me wings to reach that better shore, Far away! THE LYRE AND FLOWER. A lyre its plaintive sweetness pour'd Forth on the wild wind's track; The stormy wanderer jarr'd the chord, But gave no music back. —Oh, child of song! Bear hence to heaven thy fire! What hopest thou from the reckless throng; Be not like that lost lyre! Not like that lyre! A flower its leaves and odours cast On a swift-rolling wave; Th' unheeding torrent darkly pass'd, And back no treasure gave. —Oh! heart of love! Waste not thy precious dower! Turn to thine only home above, Be not like that lost flower! Not like that flower! SISTER! SINCE I MET THEE LAST. Sister! since I met thee last, O'er thy brow a change hath past, In the softness of thine eyes, Deep and still a shadow lies; From thy voice there thrills a tone, Never to thy childhood known; Through thy soul a storm hath moved, —Gentle sister, thou hast loved! Yes! thy varying cheek hath caught Hues too bright from troubled thought; Far along the wandering stream, Thou art follow'd by a dream: In the woods and valleys lone Music haunts thee, not thine own: Wherefore fall thy tears like rain? —Sister, thou hast loved in vain! Tell me not the tale, my flower! On my bosom pour that shower! Tell me not of kind thoughts wasted; Tell me not of young hopes blasted; Wring not forth one burning word, Let thy heart no more be stirr'd! Home alone can give thee rest. —Weep, sweet sister, on my breast! THE LONELY BIRD. From a ruin thou art singing, Oh! lonely, lonely bird! The soft blue air is ringing By thy summer music stirr'd; But all is dark and cold beneath, Where harps no more are heard: Whence winn'st thou that exulting breath, Oh! lonely, lonely bird? Thy song flows richly swelling, To a triumph of glad sounds, As from its cavern dwelling A stream in glory bounds! Though the castle echoes catch no tone Of human step or word, Though the fires be quench'd and the feasting done, Oh! lonely, lonely bird! How can that flood of gladness Rush through thy fiery lay, From the haunted place of sadness, From the bosom of decay? While dirge-notes in the breeze's moan, Through the ivy garlands heard, Come blent with thy rejoicing tone, Oh! lonely, lonely bird! There's many a heart, wild singer, Like thy forsaken tower, Where joy no more may linger, Where love hath left his bower: And there's many a spirit e'en like thee, To mirth as lightly stirr'd, Though it soar from ruins in its glee, Oh! lonely, lonely bird! DIRGE AT SEA. Sleep!—we give thee to the wave, Red with life-blood from the brave, Thou shalt find a noble grave. Fare thee well! Sleep! thy billowy field is won. Proudly may the funeral gun, 'Midst the hush at set of sun, Boom thy knell! Lonely, lonely is thy bed, Never there may flower be shed, Marble rear'd, or brother's head Bow'd to weep. Yet thy record on the sea, Borne through battle high and free, Long the red-cross flag shall be. Sleep! oh, sleep! PILGRIM'S SONG TO THE EVENING STAR. O soft star of the west! Gleaming far, Thou'rt guiding all things home, Gentle star! Thou bring'st from rock and wave, The sea-bird to her nest, The hunter from the hills, The fisher back to rest. Light of a thousand streams, Gleaming far! O soft star of the west, Blessed star! No bowery roof is mine, No hearth of love and rest, Yet guide me to my shrine, O soft star of the west! There, there my home shall be, Heaven's dew shall cool my breast, When prayer and tear gush free, O soft star of the west! O soft star of the west, Gleaming far! Thou'rt guiding all things home, Gentle star! Shine from thy rosy heaven, Pour joy on earth and sea! Shine on, though no sweet eyes Look forth to watch for me! Light of a thousand streams, Gleaming far! O soft star of the west! Blessed star! THE MEETING OF THE SHIPS. “We take each other by the hand, and we exchange a few words and looks of kindness, and we rejoice together for a few short moments; and then days, months, years intervene, and we see and know nothing of each other.”—Washington Irving. Two barks met on the deep mid-sea, When calms had still'd the tide; A few bright days of summer glee There found them side by side. And voices of the fair and brave Rose mingling thence in mirth; And sweetly floated o'er the wave The melodies of earth. Moonlight on that lone Indian main Cloudless and lovely slept; While dancing step, and festive strain Each deck in triumph swept. And hands were link'd, and answering eyes With kindly meaning shone; Oh! brief and passing sympathies, Like leaves together blown. A little while such joy was cast Over the deep's repose, Till the loud singing winds at last Like trumpet music rose. And proudly, freely on their way The parting vessels bore; In calm or storm, by rock or bay, To meet—oh, never more! Never to blend in victory's cheer, To aid in hours of woe; And thus bright spirits mingle here, Such ties are formed below. COME AWAY. This song is in the possession of Mr Power, to be set to music. Come away!—the child where flowers are springing, Round its footsteps on the mountain slope, Hears a glad voice from the upland singing, Like the skylark's with its tone of hope: Come away! Bounding on, with sunny lands before him, All the wealth of glowing life outspread, Ere the shadow of a cloud comes o'er him, By that strain the youth in joy is led: Come away! Slowly, sadly, heavy change is falling O'er the sweetness of the voice within; Yet its tones, on restless manhood calling, Urge the hunter still to chase, to win: Come away! Come away!—the heart, at last forsaken, Smile by smile, hath proved each hope untrue; Yet a breath can still those words awaken, Though to other shores far hence they woo: Come away! In the light leaves, in the reed's faint sighing, In the low sweet sounds of early spring, Still their music wanders—till the dying Hears them pass, as on a spirit's wing: Come away! FAIR HELEN OF KIRCONNEL. Hold me upon thy faithful heart, Keep back my flitting breath; 'Tis early, early to depart, Beloved!—yet this is death! Look on me still:—let that kind eye Be the last light I see! Oh! sad it is in spring to die, But yet I die for thee! For thee, my own! thy stately head Was never thus to bow— Give tears when with me love hath fled, True love, thou know'st it now! Oh the free streams look'd bright, where'er We in our gladness roved; And the blue skies were very fair— O friend! because we loved. Farewell!—I bless thee—live thou on, When this young heart is low! Surely my blood thy life hath won— Clasp me once more—I go! MUSIC FROM SHORE. A sound comes on the rising breeze, A sweet and lovely sound! Piercing the tumult of the seas That wildly dash around. From land, from sunny land it comes, From hills with murmuring trees, From paths by still and happy homes— That sweet sound on the breeze. Why should its faint and passing sigh Thus bid my quick pulse leap? No part in earth's glad melody Is mine upon the deep. Yet blessing, blessing on the spot Whence those rich breathings flow! Kind hearts, although they know me not, Like mine there beat and glow. And blessing, from the bark that roams O'er solitary seas, To those that far in happy homes Give sweet sounds to the breeze! LOOK ON ME WITH THY CLOUDLESS EYES. Look on me with thy cloudless eyes, Truth in their dark transparence lies; Their sweetness gives me back the tears, And the free trust of early years— My gentle child! The spirit of my infant prayer Shines in the depths of quiet there; And home and love once more are mine, Found in that dewy calm divine, My gentle child! Oh! heaven is with thee in thy dreams, Its light by day around thee gleams: Thy smile hath gifts from vernal skies; Look on me with thy cloudless eyes, My gentle child! IF THOU HAST CRUSH'D A FLOWER. “O cast thou not Affection from thee! In this bitter world Hold to thy heart that only treasure fast; Watch—guard it—suffer not a breath to dim The bright gem's purity!” If thou hast crush'd a flower, The root may not be blighted; If thou hast quench'd a lamp, Once more it may be lighted: But on thy harp or on thy lute, The string which thou hast broken, Shall never in sweet sound again Give to thy touch a token! If thou hast loosed a bird Whose voice of song could cheer thee, Still, still he may be won From the skies to warble near thee: But if upon the troubled sea Thou hast thrown a gem unheeded, Hope not that wind or wave will bring The treasure back when needed. If thou hast bruised a vine, The summer's breath is healing, And its clusters yet may glow Through the leaves their bloom revealing: But if thou hast a cup o'erthrown With a bright draught fill'd—oh! never Shall earth give back that lavish'd wealth To cool thy parch'd lip's fever! The heart is like that cup, If thou waste the love it bore thee; And like that jewel gone, Which the deep will not restore thee; And like that string of harp or lute Whence the sweet sound is scatter'd:— Gently, oh! gently touch the chords, So soon for ever shatter'd. BRIGHTLY HAST THOU FLED. Brightly, brightly hast thou fled, Ere one grief had bow'd thy head, Brightly did'st thou part! With thy young thoughts pure from spot, With thy fond love wasted not, With thy bounding heart. Ne'er by sorrow to be wet, Calmly smiles thy pale cheek yet, Ere with dust o'erspread: Lilies ne'er by tempest blown, White rose which no stain hath known, Be about thee shed! So we give thee to the earth, And the primrose shall have birth O'er thy gentle head; Thou, that like a dewdrop borne On a sudden breeze of morn, Brightly thus hast fled! THE BED OF HEATH. Soldier, awake! the night is past; Hear'st thou not the bugle's blast? Feel'st thou not the dayspring's breath? Rouse thee from thy bed of heath! Arm, thou bold and strong! Soldier, what deep spell hath bound thee? Fiery steeds are neighing round thee; Banners to the fresh wind play,— Rise, and arm;—tis day, 'tis day! And thou hast slumber'd long. “Brother, on the heathery lea Longer yet my sleep must be; Though the morn of battle rise, Darkly night rolls o'er my eyes. Brother, this is death! “Call me not when bugles sound, Call me not when wine flows round; Name me but amidst the brave; Give me but a soldier's grave— But my bed of heath!” FAIRY SONG. Have ye left the greenwood lone? Are your steps for ever gone? Fairy King and Elfin Queen, Come ye to the sylvan scene, From your dim and distant shore, Never more? Shall the pilgrim never hear With a thrill of joy and fear, In the hush of moonlight hours, Voices from the folded flowers, Faint sweet flute-notes as of yore, Never more? “Mortal! ne'er shall bowers of earth Hear again our midnight mirth: By our brooks and dingles green Since unhallow'd steps have been, Ours shall thread the forests hoar Never more. “Ne'er on earthborn lily's stem Will we hang the dewdrop's gem; Ne'er shall reed or cowslip's head Quiver to our dancing tread, By sweet fount or murmuring shore, Never more!” WHAT WOKE THE BURIED SOUND. What woke the buried sound that lay In Memnon's harp of yore? What spirit on its viewless way Along the Nile's green shore? Oh! not the night, and not the storm, And not the lightning's fire, But sunlight's torch, the kind, the warm, This, this awoke the lyre. What wins the heart's deep chords to pour Thus music forth on life? Like a sweet voice prevailing o'er The truant sounds of strife.— Oh! not the conflict 'midst the throng, Not e'en the trumpet's hour; Love is the gifted and the strong, To wake that music's power! OH! IF THOU WILT NOT GIVE THINE HEART. Oh! if thou wilt not give thine heart, Give back mine own to me, The first two lines of this song are literally translated from the German. Or bid thine image thence depart, And leave me lone, but free. Yet no! this mournful love of mine, I would not from me cast! Let me but dream 'twill win me thine By its deep truth at last. Can aught so fond, so faithful, live Through years without reply? Oh! if thine heart thou wilt not give, Give me a thought, a sigh! LOOK ON ME THUS NO MORE. It is thy pity makes me weep, My soul was strong before; Silent, yet strong its griefs to keep From vainly gushing o'er! Turn from me, turn those gentle eyes— In this fond gaze my spirit dies. Look on me thus no more! Too late that softness comes to bless, My heart's glad life is o'er; It will but break with tenderness, Which cannot now restore! The lyre-strings have been jarr'd too long, Winter hath touch'd the source of song! Look on me thus no more! SING TO ME, GONDOLIER! Sing to me, Gondolier! Sing words from Tasso's lay; While blue, and still, and clear, Night seems but softer day: The gale is gently falling, As if it paused to hear Some strain the past recalling— Sing to me, Gondolier! “Oh, ask me not to wake The memory of the brave; Bid no high numbers break The silence of the wave. Gone are the noble-hearted, Closed the bright pageants here; And the glad song is departed From the mournful Gondolier!” O'ER THE FAR BLUE MOUNTAINS. Set to music by the Author's sister. O'er the far blue mountains, O'er the white sea foam, Come, thou long parted one, Back to thine home! When the bright fire shineth, Sad looks thy place, While the true heart pineth Missing thy face. Music is sorrowful Since thou art gone, Sisters are mourning thee, Come to thine own! Hark! the home voices call Back to thy rest; Come to thy father's hall, Thy mother's breast! O'er the far blue mountains, O'er the white sea foam, Come, thou long parted one, Back to thine home! O THOU BREEZE OF SPRING! Set to music by John Lodge, Esq. O thou breeze of spring! Gladdening sea and shore, Wake the woods to sing, Wake my heart no more! Streams have felt the sighing Of thy scented wing, Let each fount replying Hail thee, breeze of spring, Once more! O'er long buried flowers Passing not in vain, Odours in soft showers Thou hast brought again. —Let the primrose greet thee, Let the violet pour Incense forth to meet thee— Wake my heart no more! No more! From a funeral urn Bower'd in leafy gloom, Even thy soft return Calls not song or bloom. Leave my spirit sleeping Like that silent thing; Stir the founts of weeping There, O breeze of spring, No more! COME TO ME, DREAMS OF HEAVEN. Come to me, dreams of heaven! My fainting spirit bear On your bright wings, by morning given, Up to celestial air. Away, far, far away, From bowers by tempests riven, Fold me in blue, still, cloudless day, O blessed dreams of heaven! Come but for one brief hour, Sweet dreams! and yet again, O'er burning thought and memory shower Your soft effacing rain! Waft me where gales divine, With dark clouds ne'er have striven, Where living founts for ever shine— O blessed dreams of heaven! Set to music by Miss Graves. GOOD-NIGHT. For a melody of Eisenhofer's. Day is past! Stars have set their watch at last, Founts that through the deep woods flow Make sweet sounds, unheard till now, Flowers have shut with fading light— Good-night! Go to rest! Sleep sit dove-like on thy breast! If within that secret cell One dark form of memory dwell, Be it mantled from thy sight— Good-night! Joy be thine! Kind looks o'er thy slumbers shine! Go, and in the spirit-land Meet thy home's long parted band, Be their eyes all love and light— Good-night! Peace to all! Dreams of heaven on mourners fall! Exile! o'er thy couch may gleams Pass from thine own mountain streams; Bard! away to worlds more bright— Good-night! LET HER DEPART. Her home is far, oh! far away! The clear light in her eyes Hath nought to do with earthly day, 'Tis kindled from the skies. Let her depart! She looks upon the things of earth, Even as some gentle star Seems gazing down on grief or mirth, How softly, yet how far! Let her depart! Her spirit's hope—her bosom's love— Oh! could they mount and fly! She never sees a wandering dove, But for its wings to sigh. Let her depart! She never hears a soft wind bear Low music on its way, But deems it sent from heavenly air, For her who cannot stay. Let her depart! Wrapt in a cloud of glorious dreams, She breathes and moves alone, Pining for those bright bowers and streams Where her beloved is gone. Let her depart! HOW CAN THAT LOVE SO DEEP, SO LONE. How can that love so deep, so lone, So faithful unto death, Thus fitfully in laughing tone, In airy word, find breath? Nay, ask how on the dark wave's breast, The lily's cup may gleam, Though many a mournful secret rest, Low in the unfathom'd stream. That stream is like my hidden love, In its deep cavern's power, And like the play of words above, That lily's trembling flower. WATER-LILIES. A FAIRY SONG. Come away, elves! while the dew is sweet, Come to the dingles where fairies meet; Know that the lilies have spread their bells O'er all the pools in our forest dells; Stilly and lightly their vases rest On the quivering sleep of the water's breast, Catching the sunshine through leaves that throw To their scented bosoms an emerald glow; And a star from the depth of each pearly cup, A golden star unto heaven looks up, As if seeking its kindred where bright they lie, Set in the blue of the summer sky. —Come away! under arching boughs we'll float, Making those urns each a fairy boat; We'll row them with reeds o'er the fountains free, And a tall flag-leaf shall our streamer be, And we'll send out wild music so sweet and low, It shall seem from the bright flower's heart to flow, As if 'twere a breeze with a flute's low sigh, Or water drops train'd into melody. —Come away! for the midsummer sun grows strong, And the life of the lily may not be long THE BROKEN FLOWER. Oh! wear it on thy heart, my love! Still, still a little while! Sweetness is lingering in its leaves, Though faded be their smile. Yet, for the sake of what hath been, Oh, cast it not away! 'Twas born to grace a summer scene, A long, bright, golden day, My love! A long, bright, golden day! A little while around thee, love! Its fragrance yet shall cling, Telling, that on thy heart hath lain, A fair, though faded thing. But not even that warm heart hath power To win it back from fate: —Oh! I am like thy broken flower, Cherish'd too late, too late, My love! Cherish'd alas! too late! I WOULD WE HAD NOT MET AGAIN. I would we had not met again! I had a dream of thee, Lovely, though sad, on desert plain, Mournful on midnight sea. What though it haunted me by night, And troubled through the day? It touched all earth with spirit-light, It glorified my way! Oh! what shall now my faith restore In holy things and fair? We met—I saw thy soul once more— The world's breath had been there! Yes! it was sad on desert-plain, Mournful on midnight sea, Yet would I buy with life again That one deep dream of thee! FAIRIES' RECALL. While the blue is richest In the starry sky, While the softest shadows On the greensward lie, While the moonlight slumbers In the lily's urn, Bright elves of the wild wood! Oh! return, return! Round the forest fountain, On the river shore, Let your silvery laughter Echo yet once more; While the joyous bounding Of your dewy feet Rings to that old chorus: “The daisy is so sweet!” See the chorus of Fairies in the “Flower and the Leaf” of Chaucer. Oberon, Titania, Did your starlight mirth, With the song of Avon, Quit this work-day earth? Yet while green leaves glisten, And while bright stars burn, By that magic memory, Oh, return, return! THE ROCK BESIDE THE SEA. Oh! tell me not the woods are fair, Now Spring is on her way; Well, well I know how brightly there In joy the young leaves play; How sweet on winds of morn or eve The violet's breath may be;— Yet ask me, woo me not to leave My lone rock by the sea. The wild wave's thunder on the shore, The curlew's restless cries, Unto my watching heart are more Than all earth's melodies. Come back my ocean rover! come! There's but one place for me. Till I can greet thy swift sail home— My lone rock by the sea! O YE VOICES GONE. Set to music by Miss H. Corbett. Oh! ye voices gone, Sounds of other years! Hush that haunting tone, Melt me not to tears! All around forget, All who loved you well, Yet, sweet voices, yet O'er my soul ye swell. With the winds of spring, With the breath of flowers, Floating back, ye bring Thoughts of vanish'd hours. Hence your music take, Oh! ye voices gone! This lone heart ye make But more deeply lone. BY A MOUNTAIN STREAM AT REST. By a mountain stream at rest, We found the warrior lying, And around his noble breast A banner clasp'd in dying: Dark and still Was every hill, And the winds of night were sighing. Last of his noble race, To a lonely bed we bore him; 'Twas a green, still, solemn place, Where the mountain-heath waves o'er him. Woods alone Seem to moan, Wild streams to deplore him. Yet, from festive hall and lay Our sad thoughts oft are flying, To those dark hills far away, Where in death we found him lying; On his breast A banner press'd, And the night-wind o'er him sighing. IS THERE SOME SPIRIT SIGHING. Is there some spirit sighing With sorrow in the air, Can weary hearts be dying, Vain love repining there? If not, then how can that wild wail, O sad Æolian lyre! Be drawn forth by the wandering gale, From thy deep thrilling wire? No, no!—thou dost not borrow That sadness from the wind, Nor are those tones of sorrow In thee, O harp! enshrined; But in our own hearts deeply set Lies the true quivering lyre, Whence love, and memory, and regret, Wake answers from thy wire. THE NAME OF ENGLAND. The trumpet of the battle Hath a high and thrilling tone; And the first deep gun of an ocean fight Dread music all its own. But a mightier power, my England! Is in that name of thine, To strike the fire from every heart Along the banner'd line. Proudly it woke the spirits Of yore, the brave and true, When the bow was bent on Cressy's field, And the yeoman's arrow flew. And proudly hath it floated Through the battles of the sea, When the red-cross flag o'er smoke wreaths play'd, Like the lightning in its glee. On rock, on wave, on bastion, Its echoes have been known, By a thousand streams the hearts lie low, That have answer'd to its tone. A thousand ancient mountains Its pealing note hath stirr'd; —Sound on, and on, for evermore, O thou victorious word! OLD NORWAY. These words have been published, as arranged to the spirited national air of Norway, by Charles Graves, Esq. A MOUNTAIN WAR-SONG. Arise! old Norway sends the word Of battle on the blast; Her voice the forest pines hath stirr'd, As if a storm went past; Her thousand hills the call have heard, And forth their fire-flags cast. Arm, arm, free hunters! for the chase, The kingly chase of foes; 'Tis not the bear or wild wolf's race, Whose trampling shakes the snows; Arm, arm! 'tis on a nobler trace The northern spearman goes. Our hills have dark and strong defiles, With many an icy bed; Heap there the rocks for funeral piles, Above the invader's head! Or let the seas, that guard our isles, Give burial to his dead! COME TO ME, GENTLE SLEEP. Come to me, gentle sleep! I pine, I pine for thee; Come with thy spells, the soft, the deep, And set my spirit free! Each lonely, burning thought, In twilight languor steep— Come to the full heart, long o'erwrought, O gentle, gentle sleep! Come with thine urn of dew, Sleep, gentle sleep! yet bring No voice, love's yearning to renew, No vision on thy wing! Come, as to folding flowers, To birds in forests deep; —Long, dark, and dreamless be thine hours, O gentle, gentle sleep! THE LEAGUE OF THE ALPS; OR, THE MEETING ON THE FIELD OF GRUTLI. In point of chronology, this poem should have followed “The Vespers of Palermo” and “Songs of the Cid.” Having been inadvertently omitted in its proper place, it is here inserted between the “Songs for Music” and the “Scenes and Hymns of Life,” in order more strikingly to exhibit the changes in style and habits of thought apparent between the earlier and later compositions of Mrs Hemans. I 'Twas night upon the Alps. The Senn's wild horn, Like a wind's voice, had pour'd its last long tone, Whose pealing echoes, through the larch-woods borne, To the low cabins of the glens made known That welcome steps were nigh. The flocks had gone, By cliff and pine-bridge, to their place of rest; The chamois slumber'd, for the chase was done; His cavern-bed of moss the hunter press'd, And the rock-eagle couch'd high on his cloudy nest. II Did the land sleep?—the woodman's axe had ceased Its ringing notes upon the beech and plane; The grapes were gather'd in; the vintage feast Was closed upon the hills, the reaper's strain, Hush'd by the streams; the year was in its wane, The night in its mid-watch; it was a time E'en mark'd and hallow'd unto slumber's reign. But thoughts were stirring, restless and sublime, And o'er his white Alps moved the spirit of the clime. III For there, where snows, in crowning glory spread, High and unmark'd by mortal footstep lay; And there, where torrents, 'mid the ice-caves fed, Burst in their joy of light and sound away; And there, where freedom, as in scornful play, Had hung man's dwellings 'midst the realms of air, O'er cliffs the very birthplace of the day— Oh! who would dream that tyranny could dare To lay her withering hand on God's bright works e'en there? IV Yet thus it was—amidst the fleet streams gushing To bring down rainbows o'er their sparry cell, And the glad heights, through mist and tempest rushing Up where the sun's red fire-glance earliest fell, And the fresh pastures where the herd's sweet bell Recall'd such life as Eastern patriarchs led: There peasant men their free thoughts might not tell Save in the hour of shadows and of dread, And hollow sounds that wake to Guilt's dull stealthy tread. V But in a land of happy shepherd homes, On its green hills in quiet joy reclining, With their bright hearth-fires 'midst the twilight glooms, From bowery lattice through the fir-woods shining— A land of legends, and wild songs entwining Their memory with all memories loved and blest— In such a land there dwells a power, combining The strength of many a calm but fearless breast; And woe to him who breaks the Sabbath of its rest! VI A sound went up—the wave's dark sleep was broken— On Uri's lake was heard a midnight oar— Of man's brief course a troubled moment's token Th' eternal waters to their barriers bore; And then their gloom a flashing image wore Of torch-fires streaming out o'er crag and wood, And the wild-falcon's wing was heard to soar In startled haste—and by that moonlight flood, A band of patriot men on Grutli's verdure stood. VII They stood in arms: the wolf-spear and the bow Had waged their war on things of mountain race; Might not their swift stroke reach a mail-clad foe? —Strong hands in harvest, daring feet in chase, True hearts in fight, were gather'd on that place Of secret council.—Not for fame or spoil So met those men in Heaven's majestic face;— To guard free hearths they rose, the sons of toil, The hunter of the rocks, the tiller of the soil. VIII O'er their low pastoral valleys might the tide Of years have flow'd, and still, from sire to son, Their names and records on the green earth died, As cottage-lamps, expiring one by one In the dim glades, when midnight hath begun To hush all sound.—But silent on its height, The snow-mass, full of death, while ages run Their course, may slumber, bathed in rosy light, Till some rash voice or step disturb its brooding might. IX So were they roused—th' invading step had pass'd Their cabin thresholds, and the lowly door, Which well had stood against the Fohnwind's blast, Could bar Oppression from their home no more. Why, what had she to do where all things wore Wild grandeur's impress?—In the storm's free way, How dared she lift her pageant crest before Th' enduring and magnificent array Of sovereign Alps, that wing'd their eagles with the day? X This might not long be borne—the tameless hills Have voices from the cave and cataract swelling, Fraught with His name, whose awful presence fills Their deep lone places, and for ever telling That He hath made man free! and they whose dwelling Was in those ancient fastnesses, gave ear; The weight of sufferance from their hearts repelling, They rose—the forester—the mountaineer— Oh! what hath earth more strong than the good peasant-spear? XI Sacred be Grutli's field—their vigil keeping Through many a blue and starry summer night, There, while the sons of happier lands were sleeping, Had those brave Switzers met, and in the sight Of the just God, who pours forth burning might To gird the oppress'd, had given their deep thoughts way, And braced their spirits for the patriot fight, With lovely images of homes that lay Bower'd 'midst the rustling pines, or by the torrent spray. XII Now had endurance reach'd its bounds!—They came With courage set in each bright earnest eye, The day, the signal, and the hour to name, When they should gather on their hills to die, Or shake the glaciers with their joyous cry For the land's freedom.—'Twas a scene combining All glory in itself—the solemn sky, The stars, the waves their soften'd light enshrining, And man's high soul supreme o'er mighty Nature shining. XIII Calmly they stood, and with collected mien, Breathing their souls in voices firm but low As if the spirit of the hour and scene, With the woods' whisper and the waves' sweet flow, Had temper'd in their thoughtful hearts the glow Of all indignant feeling. To the breath Of Dorian flute, and lyre-note soft and slow, E'en thus of old, the Spartan from its sheath Drew his devoted sword, and girt himself for death. XIV And three, that seem'd as chieftains of the band, Were gather'd in the 'midst on that lone shore By Uri's lake—a father of the land, One on his brow the silent record wore Of many days, whose shadows had pass'd o'er His path among the hills, and quench'd the dreams Of youth with sorrow.—Yet from memory's lore Still his life's evening drew its loveliest gleams, For he had walk'd with God, beside the mountain-streams. XV And his grey hairs, in happier times, might well To their last pillow silently have gone, As melts a wreath of snow.—But who shall tell How life may task the spirit?—He was one, Who from its morn a freeman's work had done, And reap'd his harvest, and his vintage press'd, Fearless of wrong; and now, at set of sun, He bow'd not to his years, for on the breast Of a still chainless land he deem'd it much to rest. XVI But for such holy rest strong hands must toil, Strong hearts endure!—By that pale elder's side, Stood one that seem'd a monarch of the soil, Serene and stately in his manhood's pride, Werner, the brave and true!—If men have died, Their hearths and shrines inviolate to keep, He was a mate for such.—The voice that cried Within his breast, “Arise!” came still and deep From his far home, that smiled e'en then in moonlight sleep. XVII It was a home to die for!—As it rose Through its vine-foliage, sending forth a sound Of mirthful childhood, o'er the green repose And laughing sunshine of the pastures round; And he whose life to that sweet spot was bound Raised unto Heaven a glad yet thoughtful eye, And set his free step firmer on the ground, When o'er his soul its melodies went by As through some Alpine pass, a breeze of Italy. XVIII But who was he, that on his hunting-spear Lean'd with a prouder and more fiery bearing? His was a brow for tyrant hearts to fear, Within the shadow of its dark locks wearing That which they may not tame—a soul declaring War against earth's oppressors. 'Midst that throng, Of other mould he seem'd, and loftier daring, One whose blood swept high impulses along, One that should pass, and leave a name for warlike song— XIX A memory on the mountains!—one to stand, When the hills echo'd with the deepening swell Of hostile trumpets, foremost for the land, And in some rock defile, or savage dell, Array her peasant-children to repel Th' invader, sending arrows for his chains! Ay, one to fold around him, as he fell, Her banner with a smile—for through his veins The joy of danger flow'd, as torrents to the plains. XX There was at times a wildness in the light Of his quick-flashing eye; a something, born Of the free Alps, and beautifully bright, And proud, and tameless, laughing fear to scorn! It well might be!—Young Erni's step had worn The mantling snows on their most regal steeps, And track'd the lynx above the clouds of morn, And follow'd where the flying chamois leaps Across the dark-blue rifts, th' unfathom'd glacier deeps. XXI He was a creature of the Alpine sky, A being whose bright spirit had been fed 'Midst the crown'd heights of joy and liberty, And thoughts of power. He knew each path which led To the rock's treasure-caves, whose crystal shed Soft light o'er secret fountains. At the tone Of his loud horn, the Lammer-Geyer had spread A startled wing; for oft that peal had blown Where the free cataract's voice was wont to sound alone. XXII His step had track'd the waste, his soul had stirr'd The ancient solitudes—his voice had told Of wrongs to call down Heaven. That tale was heard In Hasli's dales, and where the shepherds' fold Their flocks in dark ravine and craggy hold On the bleak Oberland; and where the light Of day's last footstep bathes in burning gold Great Righi's cliffs; and where Mount Pilate's height Casts o'er his glassy lake the darkness of his might. XXIII Nor was it heard in vain. There all things press High thoughts on man. The fearless hunter pass'd, And, from the bosom of the wilderness, There leapt a spirit and a power to cast The weight of bondage down—and bright and fast, As the clear waters, joyously and free, Burst from the desert-rock, it rush'd at last, Through the far valleys; till the patriot three Thus with their brethren stood, beside the Forest Sea. XXIV They link'd their hands, they pledged their stainless faith, In the dread presence of attesting Heaven, They bound their hearts to suffering and to death, With the severe and solemn transport given To bless such vows. How nobly man had striven, How man might strive, and vainly strive, they knew, And call'd upon their God, whose arm had riven The crest of many a tyrant, since He blew, The foaming sea-wave on, and Egypt's might o'er-threw. XXV They knelt, and rose in strength. The valleys lay Still in their dimness, but the peaks which darted Into the bright mid-air, had caught from day A flush of fire, when those true Switzers parted, Each to his glen or forest, steadfast-hearted, And full of hope. Not many suns had worn Their setting glory, ere from slumber started Ten thousand voices, of the mountains born— So far was heard the blast of freedom's echoing horn! XXVI The ice-vaults trembled, when that peal came rending The frozen stillness which around them hung; From cliff to cliff the avalanche descending, Gave answer, till the sky's blue hollow rung; And the flame-signals through the midnight sprung From the Surennen rocks, like banners streaming To the far Seelisberg; whence light was flung On Grutli's field, till all the red lake gleaming, Shone out, a meteor-heaven in its wild splendour seeming. XXVII And the winds toss'd each summit's blazing crest, As a host's plumage; and the giant pines, Fell'd where they waved o'er crag and eagle's nest, Heap'd up the flames. The clouds grew fiery signs, As o'er a city's burning towers and shrines, Reddening the distance. Wine-cups, crown'd and bright, In Werner's dwelling flow'd; through leafless vines From Walter's hearth stream'd forth the festive light, And Erni's blind old sire gave thanks to heaven that night. XXVIII Then on the silence of the snows there lay A Sabbath's quiet sunshine—and its bell Fill'd the hush'd air awhile, with lonely sway; For the stream's voice was chain'd by Winter's spell. The deep wood-sounds had ceased. But rock and dell Rung forth, erelong, when strains of jubilee Peal'd from the mountain-churches, with a swell Of praise to Him who stills the raging sea— For now the strife was closed, the glorious Alps were free! SCENES AND HYMNS OF LIFE; WITH OTHER RELIGIOUS POEMS. TO WILLIAM WORDSWORTH Esq. IN TOKEN OF DEEP RESPECT FOR HIS CHARACTER, AND FERVENT GRATITUDE FOR MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL BENEFIT DERIVED FROM REVERENTIAL COMMUNION WITH THE SPIRIT OF HIS POETRY, THIS VOLUME IS AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED BY FELICIA HEMANS. THE ENGLISH MARTYRS; A SCENE OF THE DAYS OF QUEEN MARY. “Thy face Is all at once spread over with a calm More beautiful than sleep, or mirth, or joy! I am no more disconsolate.” Wilson. Scene in a Prison. Edith alone. Edith. Morn once again! Morn in the lone dim cell, The cavern of the prisoner's fever dream, And morn on all the green rejoicing hills, And the bright waters round the prisoner's home, Far, far away! Now wakes the early bird That in the lime's transparent foliage sings, Close to my cottage lattice—he awakes, To stir the young leaves with his gushing soul, And to call forth rich answers of delight From voices buried in a thousand trees, Through the dim starry hours. Now doth the lake Darken and flash in rapid interchange Unto the matin breeze; and the blue mist Rolls, like a furling banner, from the brows Of the forth-gleaming hills and woods that rise As if new-born. Bright world! and I am here! And thou, O thou! the awakening thought of whom Was more than dayspring, dearer than the sun, Herbert! the very glance of whose clear eye Made my soul melt away to one pure fount Of living, bounding gladness!—where art thou? My friend! my only and my blessed love! Herbert, my soul's companion! [Gomez, a Spanish Priest enters. Gom. Daughter, hail! I bring thee tidings. Ed. Heaven will aid my soul Calmly to meet whate'er thy lips announce. Gom. Nay, lift a song of thanksgiving to Heaven, And bow thy knee down for deliverance won! Hast thou not pray'd for life? and would'st thou not Once more be free? Ed. Have I not pray'd for life? I, that am so beloved! that love again With such a heart of tendrils? Heaven! thou know'st The gushings of my prayer! And would I not Once more be free? I that have been a child Of breezy hills, a playmate of the fawn In ancient woodlands from mine infancy! A watcher of the clouds and of the stars, Beneath the adoring silence of the night; And a glad wanderer with the happy streams, Whose laughter fills the mountains! Oh! to hear Their blessed sounds again! Gom. Rejoice, rejoice! Our Queen hath pity, maiden, on thy youth; She wills not thou should'st perish.—I am come To loose thy bonds. Ed. And shall I see his face, And shall I listen to his voice again, And lay my head upon his faithful breast, Weeping there in my gladness? Will this be?— Blessings upon thee, father! my quick heart Hath deem'd thee stern—say, wilt thou not forgive The wayward child, too long in sunshine rear'd— Too long unused to chastening? Wilt thou not? But Herbert, Herbert! Oh, my soul hath rush'd On a swift gust of sudden joy away, Forgetting all beside! Speak, father, speak! Herbert—is he too free? Gom. His freedom lies In his own choice—a boon like thine. Ed. Thy words Fall changed and cold upon my boding heart. Leave not this dim suspense o'ershadowing me. Let all be told. Gom. The monarchs of the earth Shower not their mighty gifts without a claim Unto some token of true vassalage, Some mark of homage. Ed. Oh! unlike to Him, Who freely pours the joy of sunshine forth, And the bright quickening rain, on those who serve And those who heed him not! Gom. (laying a paper before her.) Is it so much That thine own hand should set the crowning seal To thy deliverance? Look, thy task is here! Sign but these words for liberty and life. Ed. (examining and then throwing it from her.) Sign but these words! and wherefore saidst thou not, “Be but a traitor to God's light within?”— Cruel, oh, cruel! thy dark sport hath been With a young bosom's hope! Farewell, glad life! Bright opening path to love and home farewell! And thou—now leave me with my God alone! Gom. Dost thou reject Heaven's mercy? Ed. Heaven's! doth Heaven Woo the free spirit for dishonour'd breath To sell its birthright? doth Heaven set a price On the clear jewel of unsullied faith, And the bright calm of conscience? Priest, away! God hath been with me 'midst the holiness Of England's mountains. Not in sport alone I trod their heath-flowers; but high thoughts rose up From the broad shadow of the enduring rocks, And wander'd with me into solemn glens, Where my soul felt the beauty of his word. I have heard voices of immortal truth, Blent with the everlasting torrent-sounds That make the deep hills tremble.—Shall I quail?— Shall England's daughter sink?—No! He who there Spoke to my heart in silence and in storm, Will not forsake his child! Gom. (turning from her.) Then perish! lost In thine own blindness! Ed. (suddenly throwing herself at his feet.) Father! hear me yet! Oh! if the kindly touch of human love Hath ever warm'd thy breast— Gom. Away—away! I know not love. Ed. Yet hear! if thou hast known The tender sweetness of a mother's voice— If the true vigil of affection's eye Hath watch'd thy childhood—if fond tears have e'er Been shower'd upon thy head—if parting words E'er pierced thy spirit with their tenderness— Let me but look upon his face once more, Let me but say—farewell, my soul's beloved! And I will bless thee still! Gom. (aside.) Her soul may yield, Beholding him in fetters; woman's faith Will bend to woman's love— Thy prayer is heard; Follow, and I will guide thee to his cell. Ed. Oh! stormy hour of agony and joy! But I shall see him—I shall hear his voice! [They go out. Scene II. —Another Part of the Prison. Herbert—Edith. Ed. Herbert, my Herbert! is it thus we meet? Her. The voice of my own Edith! Can such joy Light up this place of death? And do I feel Thy breath of love once more upon my cheek, And the soft floating of thy gleamy hair, My blessed Edith? Oh, so pale! so changed! My flower, my blighted flower! thou that wert made For the kind fostering of sweet summer airs, How hath the storm been with thee!—Lay thy head On this true breast again, my gentle one! And tell me all. Ed. Yes, take me to thy heart, For I am weary, weary! Oh! that heart! The kind, the brave, the tender!—how my soul Hath sicken'd in vain yearnings for the balm Of rest on that warm heart!—full, deep repose! One draught of dewy stillness after storm! And God hath pitied me, and I am here— Yet once before I die! Her. They cannot slay One young, and meek, and beautiful as thou, My broken lily! Surely the long days Of the dark cell have been enough for thee! Oh! thou shalt live, and raise thy gracious head Yet in calm sunshine. Ed. Herbert! I have cast The snare of proffer'd mercy from my soul, This very hour. God to the weak hath given Victory o'er life and death!—The tempter's price Hath been rejected—Herbert, I must die. Her. O Edith! Edith! I, that led thee first From the old path wherein thy fathers trod— I, that received it as an angel's task, To pour the fresh light on thine ardent soul, Which drank it as a sunflower—I have been Thy guide to death! Ed. To heaven! my guide to heaven, My noble and my bless'd! Oh! look up, Be strong, rejoice, my Herbert! But for thee, How could my spirit have sprung up to God, Through the dark cloud which o'er its vision hung, The night of fear and error?—thy dear hand First raised that veil, and show'd the glorious world My heritage beyond.—Friend! love, and friend! It was as if thou gav'st me mine own soul In those bright days! Yes! a new earth and heaven, And a new sense for all their splendours born, These were thy gifts! and shall I not rejoice To die, upholding their immortal worth, Even for thy sake? Yes, fill'd with nobler life By thy pure love, made holy to the truth, Lay me upon the altar of thy God, The first fruits of thy ministry below; Thy work, thine own! Her. My love, my sainted love! Oh! I can almost yield thee unto heaven; Earth would but sully thee! Thou must depart, With the rich crown of thy celestial gifts Untainted by a breath! And yet, alas! Edith! what dreams of holy happiness, Even for this world, were ours!—the low, sweet home, The pastoral dwelling, with its ivied porch, And lattice gleaming through the leaves—and thou, My life's companion!—Thou, beside my hearth, Sitting with thy meek eyes, or greeting me Back from brief absence with thy bounding step, In the green meadow-path, or by my side Kneeling—thy calm uplifted face to mine, In the sweet hush of prayer! and now—oh! now— How have we loved—how fervently, how long! And this to be the close! Ed. Oh! bear me up Against the unutterable tenderness Of earthly love, my God! in the sick hour Of dying human hope, forsake me not! Herbert, my Herbert! even from that sweet home Where it had been too much of Paradise To dwell with thee—even thence the oppressor's hand Might soon have torn us; or the touch of death Might one day there have left a widow'd heart, Pining alone. We will go hence, beloved! To the bright country, where the wicked cease From troubling, where the spoiler hath no sway; Where no harsh voice of worldliness disturbs The Sabbath-peace of love. We will go hence, Together with our wedded souls, to heaven: No solitary lingering, no cold void, No dying of the heart! Our lives have been Lovely through faithful love, and in our deaths We will not be divided. Her. Oh! the peace Of God is lying far within thine eyes, Far underneath the mist of human tears, Lighting those blue still depths, and sinking thence On my worn heart. Now am I girt with strength, Now I can bless thee, my true bride for Heaven! Ed. And let me bless thee, Herbert! in this hour Let my soul bless thee with prevailing might! Oh! thou hast loved me nobly! thou didst take An orphan to thy heart, a thing unprized And desolate; and thou didst guard her there, That lone and lowly creature, as a pearl Of richest price; and thou didst fill her soul With the high gifts of an immortal wealth.— I bless, I bless thee! Never did thine eye Look on me but in glistening tenderness, My gentle Herbert! Never did thy voice But in affection's deepest music speak To thy poor Edith! Never was thy heart Aught but the kindliest sheltering home to mine, My faithful, generous Herbert! Woman's peace Ne'er on a breast so tender and so true Reposed before.—Alas! thy showering tears Fall fast upon my cheek—forgive, forgive! I should not melt thy noble strength away In such an hour. Her. Sweet Edith, no! my heart Will fail no more; God bears me up through thee, And, by thy words, and by the heavenly light Shining around thee, through thy very tears, Will yet sustain me! Let us call on him! Let us kneel down, as we have knelt so oft, Thy pure cheek touching mine, and call on Him, Th' all-pitying One, to aid. [They kneel. O, look on us, Father above! in tender mercy look On us, thy children! through th' o'ershadowing cloud Of sorrow and mortality, send aid— Save or we perish! We would pour our lives Forth as a joyous offering to thy truth, But we are weak—we, the bruised reeds of earth, Are sway'd by every gust. Forgive, O God! The blindness of our passionate desires, The fainting of our hearts, the lingering thoughts, Which cleave to dust! Forgive the strife; accept The sacrifice, though dim with mortal tears, From mortal pangs wrung forth! And if our souls, In all the fervent dreams, the fond excess, Of their long-clasping love, have wander'd not, Holiest! from thee; oh! take them to thyself, After the fiery trial, take them home To dwell, in that imperishable bond Before thee link'd, for ever. Hear, through Him Who meekly drank the cup of agony, Who pass'd through death to victory, hear and save! Pity us, Father! we are girt with snares; Father in Heaven! we have no help but thee. [They rise. Is thy soul strengthen'd, my beloved one? O Edith! couldst thou lift up thy sweet voice, And sing me that old solemn-breathing hymn We loved in happier days—the strain which tells Of the dread conflict in the olive shade? [She sings. He knelt, the Saviour knelt and pray'd, When but his Father's eye Look'd through the lonely garden's shade On that dread agony; The Lord of All above, beneath, Was bow'd with sorrow unto death. The sun set in a fearful hour, The stars might well grow dim, When this mortality had power So to o'ershadow Him! That he who gave man's breath, might know The very depths of human woe. He proved them all!—the doubt, the strife, The faint perplexing dread, The mists that hang o'er parting life, All gather'd round his head; And the Deliverer knelt to pray— Yet pass'd it not, that cup, away! It pass'd not—though the stormy wave Had sunk beneath his tread; It pass'd not—though to him the grave Had yielded up its dead. But there was sent him from on high A gift of strength for man to die. And was the sinless thus beset With anguish and dismay? How may we meet our conflict yet, In the dark narrow way? Through Him—through Him, that path who trod— Save, or we perish, Son of God! Hark, hark! the parting signal. [Prison attendants enter. Fare-thee-well! O thou unutterably loved, farewell! Let our hearts bow to God! Her. One last embrace. On earth the last!—We have eternity For love's communion yet!—Farewell—farewell!— [She is led out. 'Tis o'er—the bitterness of death is past! FLOWERS AND MUSIC IN A ROOM OF SICKNESS. “Once when I look'd along the laughing earth, Up the blue heavens, and through the middle air, Joyfully ringing with the skylark's song, I wept! and thought how sad for one so young To bid farewell to so much happiness. But Christ hath call'd me from this lower world, Delightful though it be.” Wilson. Apartment in an English Country-House.—Lilian reclining, as sleeping on a couch. Her Mother watching beside her. Her Sister enters with flowers. Mother. Hush, lightly tread! still tranquilly she sleeps, As, when a babe, I rock'd her on my heart. I've watch'd, suspending e'en my breath, in fear To break the heavenly spell. Move silently! And oh! those flowers! dear Jessy, bear them hence— Dost thou forget the passion of quick tears That shook her trembling frame, when last we brought The roses to her couch? Dost thou not know What sudden longings for the woods and hills, Where once her free steps moved so buoyantly, These leaves and odours with strange influence wake In her fast-kindled soul? Jessy. Oh! she would pine, Were the wild scents and glowing hues withheld, Mother! far more than now her spirit yearns For the blue sky, the singing-birds and brooks, And swell of breathing turf, whose lightsome spring Their blooms recall. Lilian, (raising herself.) Is that my Jessy's voice? It woke me not, sweet mother! I had lain Silently, visited by waking dreams, Yet conscious of thy brooding watchfulness, Long ere I heard the sound. Hath she brought flowers? Nay, fear not now thy fond child's waywardness, My thoughtful mother!—in her chasten'd soul The passion-colour'd images of life, Which, with their sudden startling flush awoke So oft those burning tears, have died away; And night is there—still, solemn, holy night, With all her stars, and with the gentle tune Of many fountains, low and musical, By day unheard. Mother. And wherefore night, my child? Thou art a creature all of life and dawn, And from thy couch of sickness yet shalt rise, And walk forth with the dayspring. Lilian. Hope it not! Dream it no more, my mother!—there are things Known but to God, and to the parting soul, Which feels his thrilling summons. But my words Too much o'ershadow those kind loving eyes. Bring me thy flowers, dear Jessy! Ah! thy step, Well do I see, hath not alone explored The garden bowers, but freely visited Our wilder haunts. This foam-like meadow-sweet Is from the cool green shadowy river nook, Where the stream chimes around th' old mossy stones With sounds like childhood's laughter. Is that spot Lovely as when our glad eyes hail'd it first? Still doth the golden willow bend, and sweep The clear brown wave with every passing wind? And through the shallower waters, where they lie Dimpling in light, do the vein'd pebbles gleam Like bedded gems? And the white butterflies, From shade to sun-streak are they glancing still Among the poplar boughs? Jessy. All, all is there Which glad midsummer's wealthiest hours can bring; All, save the soul of all, thy lightening smile! Therefore I stood in sadness 'midst the leaves, And caught an under-music of lament In the stream's voice; but Nature waits thee still, And for thy coming piles a fairy throne Of richest moss. Lilian. Alas! it may not be! My soul hath sent her farewell voicelessly, To all these blessed haunts of song and thought; Yet not the less I love to look on these, Their dear memorials;—strew them o'er my couch Till it grow like a forest bank in spring, All flush'd with violets and anemones. Ah! the pale brier rose! touch'd so tenderly, As a pure ocean shell, with faintest red, Melting away to pearliness!—I know How its long light festoons o'erarching hung From the grey rock, that rises altar-like, With its high waving crown of mountain ash, 'Midst the lone grassy dell. And this rich bough Of honey'd woodbine, tells me of the oak Whose deep midsummer gloom sleeps heavily, Shedding a verdurous twilight o'er the face Of the glade's pool. Methinks I see it now; I look up through the stirring of its leaves Unto the intense blue crystal firmament. The ringdove's wing is flitting o'er my head, Casting at times a silvery shadow down 'Midst the large water-lilies. Beautiful! How beautiful is all this fair free world Under God's open sky! Mother. Thou art o'erwrought Once more, my child! The dewy trembling light Presaging tears, again is in thine eye. O, hush, dear Lilian! turn thee to repose. Lilian. Mother! I cannot. In my soul the thoughts Burn with too subtle and too swift a fire; Importunately to my lips they throng, And with their earthly kindred seek to blend Ere the veil drop between. When I am gone— (For I must go)—then the remember'd words Wherein these wild imaginings flow forth, Will to thy fond heart be as amulets Held there with life and love. And weep not thus, Mother! dear sister! kindest, gentlest ones! Be comforted that now I weep no more For the glad earth and all the golden light Whence I depart. No! God hath purified my spirit's eye, And in the folds of this consummate rose I read bright prophecies. I see not there, Dimly and mournfully, the word “farewell” On the rich petals traced: No—in soft veins And characters of beauty, I can read— “Look up, look heavenward!” Blessed God of Love I thank thee for these gifts, the precious links Whereby my spirit unto thee is drawn! I thank thee that the loveliness of earth Higher than earth can raise me! Are not these But germs of things unperishing, that bloom Beside th' immortal streams? Shall I not find The lily of the field, the Saviour's flower, In the serene and never-moaning air, And the clear starry light of angel eyes, A thousand-fold more glorious? Richer far Will not the violet's dusky purple glow, When it hath ne'er been press'd to broken hearts, A record of lost love? Mother. My Lilian! thou Surely in thy bright life hast little known Of lost things or of changed! Lilian. Oh! little yet, For thou hast been my shield! But had it been My lot on this world's billows to be thrown Without thy love—O mother! there are hearts So perilously fashion'd, that for them God's touch alone hath gentleness enough To waken, and not break, their thrilling strings!— We will not speak of this! By what strange spell Is it, that ever, when I gaze on flowers, I dream of music? Something in their hues All melting into colour'd harmonies, Wafts a swift thought of interwoven chords, Of blended singing-tones, that swell and die In tenderest falls away.—O, bring thy harp, Sister! a gentle heaviness at last Hath touch'd mine eyelids: sing to me, and sleep Will come again. Jessy. What would'st thou hear? The Italian peasant's lay, Which makes the desolate Campagna ring With “Roma, Roma?” or the madrigal Warbled on moonlight seas of Sicily? Or the old ditty left by Troubadours To girls of Languedoc? Lilian. Oh, no! not these. Jessy. What then? the Moorish melody still known Within the Alhambra city? or those notes Born of the Alps, which pierce the exile's heart Even unto death? Lilian. No, sister, nor yet these— Too much of dreamy love, of faint regret, Of passionately fond remembrance, breathes In the caressing sweetness of their tones, For one who dies;—They would but woo me back To glowing life with those Arcadian sounds— And vainly, vainly—No! a loftier strain, A deeper music!—Something that may bear The spirit upon slow yet mighty wings, Unsway'd by gusts of earth: something all fill'd With solemn adoration, tearful prayer.— Sing me that antique strain which once I deem'd Almost too sternly simple, too austere In its grave majesty! I love it now— Now it seems fraught with holiest power, to hush All billows of the soul, e'en like his voice That said of old—“Be still!”—Sing me that strain, “The Saviour's dying hour.” [Jessy sings to the Harp. O Son of Man! In thy last mortal hour Shadows of earth closed round thee fearfully! All that on us is laid, All the deep gloom, The desolation and the abandonment, The dark amaze of death; All upon thee too fell, Redeemer! Son of Man! But the keen pang Wherewith the silver cord Of earth's affection from the soul is wrung; The uptearing of those tendrils which have grown Into the quick strong heart; This, this, the passion and the agony Of battling love and death, Surely was not for thee, Holy one! Son of God! Yes, my Redeemer! E'en this cup was thine! Fond wailing voices call'd thy spirit back: E'en 'midst the mighty thoughts Of that last crowning hour; E'en on thine awful way to victory, Wildly they call'd thee back! And weeping eyes of love Unto thy heart's deep core, Pierced through the folds of death's mysterious veil— Sufferer! thou Son of Man! Mother-tears were mingled With thy costly blood-drops, In the shadow of the atoning cross; And the friend, the faithful, He that on thy bosom, Thence imbibing heavenly love, had lain— He a pale sad watcher— Met with looks of anguish, All the anguish in thy last meek glance— Dying Son of Man! Oh! therefore unto thee, Thou that hast known all woes Bound in the girdle of mortality! Thou that wilt lift the reed Which storms have bruised, To thee may sorrow through each conflict cry, And, in that tempest-hour, when love and life Mysteriously must part, When tearful eyes Are passionately bent To drink earth's last fond meaning from our gaze, Then, then forsake us not! Shed on our spirits then The faith and deep submissiveness of thine! Thou that didst love, Thou that didst weep and die— Thou that didst rise a victor glorified; Conqueror! thou Son of God! CATHEDRAL HYMN. “They dreamt not of a perishable home Who thus could build. Be mine, in hours of fear Or grovelling thought, to seek a refuge here.” Wordsworth. A dim and mighty minster of old time! A temple shadowy with remembrances Of the majestic past!—the very light Streams with a colouring of heroic days In every ray, which leads through arch and aisle A path of dreamy lustre, wandering back To other years;—and the rich fretted roof, And the wrought coronals of summer leaves, Ivy and vine, and many a sculptured rose— The tenderest image of mortality— Binding the slender columns, whose light shafts Cluster like stems in corn sheaves—all these things Tell of a race that nobly, fearlessly, On their heart's worship pour'd a wealth of love! Honour be with the dead!—The people kneel Under the helms of antique chivalry, And in the crimson gloom from banners thrown, And 'midst the forms, in pale proud slumber carved, Of warriors on their tombs.—The people kneel Where mail-clad chiefs have knelt; where jewell'd crowns On the flush'd brows of conquerors have been set; Where the high anthems of old victories Have made the dust give echoes.—Hence, vain thoughts! Memories of power and pride, which, long ago, Like dim processions of a dream, have sunk In twilight depths away.—Return, my soul! The cross recalls thee—Lo! the blessed cross! High o'er the banners and the crests of earth, Fix'd in its meek and still supremacy! And lo! the throng of beating human hearts, With all their secret scrolls of buried grief, All their full treasures of immortal hope, Gather'd before their God!—Hark! how the flood Of the rich organ harmony bears up Their voice on its high waves!—a mighty burst! A forest-sounding music! every tone Which the blasts call forth with their harping wings From gulfs of tossing foliage there is blent: And the old minster—forest-like itself— With its long avenues of pillar'd shade, Seems quivering all with spirit, as that strain O'erflows its dim recesses, leaving not One tomb unthrill'd by the strong sympathy Answering the electric notes.—Join, join, my soul! In thine own lowly, trembling consciousness, And thine own solitude, the glorious hymn. Rise like an altar-fire! In solemn joy aspire, Deepening thy passion still, O choral strain! On thy strong rushing wind Bear up from humankind Thanks and implorings—be they not in vain! Father, which art on high! Weak is the melody Of harp or song to reach thine awful ear, Unless the heart be there, Winging the words of prayer, With its own fervent faith or suppliant fear. Let, then, thy spirit brood Over the multitude— Be thou amidst them through that heavenly Guest So shall their cry have power To win from thee a shower Of healing gifts for every wounded breast. What griefs that make no sign, That ask no aid but thine, Father of mercies! here before thee swell! As to the open sky, All their dark waters lie To thee reveal'd, in each close bosom cell. The sorrow for the dead, Mantling its lonely head From the world's glare, is, in thy sight, set free; And the fond aching love, Thy minister, to move All the wrung spirit, softening it for thee. And doth not thy dread eye Behold the agony In that most hidden chamber of the heart, Where darkly sits remorse, Beside the secret source Of fearful visions, keeping watch apart? Yes! here before thy throne Many—yet each alone— To thee that terrible unveiling make; And still small whispers clear Are startling many an ear, As if a trumpet bade the dead awake. How dreadful is this place! The glory of thy face Fills it too searchingly for mortal sight: Where shall the guilty flee? Over what far off sea? What hills, what woods, may shroud him from that light? Not to the cedar shade Let his vain flight be made; Nor the old mountains, nor the desert sea; What, but the cross, can yield The hope—the stay—the shield? Thence may the Atoner lead him up to Thee! Be thou, be thou his aid! Oh! let thy love pervade The haunted caves of self-accusing thought; There let the living stone Be cleft—the seed be sown— The song of fountains from the silence brought! So shall thy breath once more Within the soul restore Thine own first image—Holiest and Most High! As a clear lake is fill'd With hues of Heaven, instill'd Down to the depths of its calm purity. And if, amidst the throng Link'd by the ascending song, There are, whose thoughts in trembling rapture soar; Thanks, Father! that the power Of joy, man's early dower, Thus, e'en 'midst tears, can fervently adore! Thanks for each gift divine! Eternal praise be thine, Blessing and love, O Thou that hearest prayer! Let the hymn pierce the sky, And let the tombs reply! For seed, that waits the harvest-time, is there. WOOD WALK AND HYMN. “Move along these shades In gentleness of heart: with gentle hand Touch—for there is a spirit in the woods.” Wordsworth. Father—Child. Child. There are the aspens, with their silvery leaves Trembling, for ever trembling; though the lime And chestnut boughs, and those long arching sprays Of eglantine, hang still, as if the wood Were all one picture! Father. Hast thou heard, my boy, The peasant's legend of that quivering tree? Child. No, father; doth he say the fairies dance Amidst the branches? Father. Oh! a cause more deep, More solemn far, the rustic doth assign To the strange restlessness of those wan leaves! The cross he deems, the blessed cross, whereon The meek Redeemer bow'd his head to death, Was framed of aspen wood; and since that hour, Through all its race the pale tree hath sent down A thrilling consciousness, a secret awe, Making them tremulous, when not a breeze Disturbs the airy thistle down, or shakes The light lines of the shining gossamer. Child, (after a pause.) Dost thou believe it, father? Father. Nay, my child, We walk in clearer light. But yet, even now, With something of a lingering love, I read The characters, by that mysterious hour, Stamp'd on the reverential soul of man In visionary days; and thence thrown back On the fair forms of nature. Many a sign Of the great sacrifice which won us heaven, The woodman and the mountaineer can trace On rock, on herb, and flower. And be it so! They do not wisely that, with hurried hand, Would pluck these salutary fancies forth From their strong soil within the peasant's breast, And scatter them—far, far too fast!—away As worthless weeds:—Oh! little do we know When they have soothed, when saved! But come, dear boy! My words grow tinged with thought too deep for thee. Come—let us search for violets. Child. Know you not More of the legends which the woodmen tell Amidst the trees and flowers! Father. Wilt thou know more? Bring then the folding leaf, with dark-brown stains, There—by the mossy roots of yon old beech, 'Midst the rich tuft of cowslips—see'st thou not? There is a spray of woodbine from the tree Just bending o'er it with a wild bee's weight. Child. The Arum leaf? Father. Yes, these deep inwrought marks, The villager will tell thee (and with voice Lower'd in his true heart's reverent earnestness) Are the flower's portion from th' atoning blood On Calvary shed. Beneath the cross it grew; And, in the vase-like hollow of its leaf, Catching from that dread shower of agony A few mysterious drops, transmitted thus Unto the groves and hills, their sealing stains, A heritage, for storm or vernal wind Never to waft away! And hast thou seen The passion-flower?—It grows not in the woods, But 'midst the bright things brought from other climes. Child. What, the pale star-shaped flower, with purple streaks And light green tendrils? Father. Thou hast mark'd it well. Yes, a pale, starry, dreamy-looking flower, As from a land of spirits!—To mine eye Those faint wan petals—colourless—and yet Not white, but shadowy—with the mystic lines (As letters of some wizard language gone) Into their vapour-like transparence wrought, Bear something of a strange solemnity, Awfully lovely!—and the Christian's thought Loves, in their cloudy penciling, to find Dread symbols of his Lord's last mortal pangs, Set by God's hand—The coronal of thorns— The cross—the wounds—with other meanings deep, Which I will teach thee when we meet again That flower, the chosen for the martyr's wreath, The Saviour's holy flower. But let us pause: Now have we reach'd the very inmost heart Of the old wood.—How the green shadows close Into a rich, clear, summer darkness round, A luxury of gloom!—Scarce doth one ray, Even when a soft wind parts the foliage, steal O'er the bronzed pillars of these deep arcades; Or if it doth, 'tis with a mellow'd hue Of glow-worm colour'd light. Here, in the days Of pagan visions, would have been a place For worship of the wood-nymphs! Through these oaks A small, fair gleaming temple might have thrown The quivering image of its Dorian shafts On the stream's bosom; or a sculptured form, Dryad, or fountain-goddess of the gloom, Have bow'd its head o'er that dark crystal down, Drooping with beauty, as a lily droops Under bright rain:—but we, my child, are here With God, our God, a Spirit; who requires Heart-worship, given in spirit and in truth; And this high knowledge—deep, rich, vast enough To fill and hallow all the solitude, Makes consecrated earth where'er we move, Without the aid of shrines. What! dost thou feel The solemn whispering influence of the scene Oppressing thy young heart, that thou dost draw More closely to my side, and clasp my hand Faster in thine? Nay, fear not, gentle child! 'Tis love, not fear, whose vernal breath pervades The stillness round. Come, sit beside me here, Where brooding violets mantle this green slope With dark exuberance—and beneath these plumes Of wavy fern, look where the cup-moss holds In its pure crimson goblets, fresh and bright, The starry dews of morning. Rest awhile And let me hear once more the woodland verse I taught thee late—'twas made for such a scene. [Child speaks. WOOD HYMN. Broods there some spirit here? The summer leaves hang silent as a cloud; And o'er the pools all still and darkly clear, The wild wood-hyacinth with awe seems bow'd; And something of a tender cloistral gloom Deepens the violet's bloom. The very light that streams Through the dim dewy veil of foliage round, Comes tremulous with emerald-tinted gleams, As if it knew the place were holy ground; And would not startle, with too bright a burst, Flowers, all divinely nursed. Wakes there some spirit here? Aswift wind, fraught with change, comes rushing by, And leaves and waters, in its wild career, Shed forth sweet voices—each a mystery! Surely some awful influence must pervade These depths of trembling shade! Yes, lightly, softly move! There is a power, a presence in the woods; A viewless being, that, with life and love, Informs the reverential solitudes: The rich air knows it, and the mossy sod— Thou, thou art here, my God! And if with awe we tread The minster floor, beneath the storied pane, And 'midst the mouldering banners of the dead, Shall the green voiceful wild seem less thy fane, Where thou alone hast built?—where arch and roof Are of thy living woof? The silence and the sound, In the lone places, breathe alike of thee; The temple twilight of the gloom profound, The dew cup of the frail anemone, The reed by every wandering whisper thrill'd— All, all with thee are fill'd! Oh! purify mine eyes, More and yet more, by love and lowly thought, Thy presence, holiest One! to recognise In these majestic aisles which thou hast wrought! And 'midst their sea-like murmurs, teach mine ear Ever thy voice to hear! And sanctify my heart To meet the awful sweetness of that tone With no faint thrill or self-accusing start, But a deep joy the heavenly guest to own— Joy, such as dwelt in Eden's glorious bowers Ere sin had dimm'd the flowers. Let me not know the change O'er nature thrown by guilt!—the boding sky, The hollow leaf-sounds ominous and strange, The weight wherewith the dark tree shadows lie! Father! oh! keep my footsteps pure and free, To walk the woods with thee! PRAYER OF THE LONELY STUDENT. “Soul of our souls! and safeguard of the world! Sustain—Thou only canst—the sick at heart, Restore their languid spirits, and recall Their lost affections unto thee and thine.” Wordsworth. Night—holy night—the time For mind's free breathings in a purer clime! Night!—when in happier hour the unveiling sky Woke all my kindled soul, To meet its revelations, clear and high, With the strong joy of immortality! Now hath strange sadness wrapp'd me—strange and deep— And my thoughts faint, and shadows o'er them roll, E'en when I deem'd them seraph-plumed, to sweep Far beyond earth's control. Wherefore is this?—I see the stars returning, Fire after fire in Heaven's rich temple burning— Fast shine they forth—my spirit friends, my guides, Bright rulers of my being's inmost tides; They shine—but faintly, through a quivering haze— Oh! is the dimness mine which clouds those rays? They from whose glance my childhood drank delight! A joy unquestioning—a love intense— They, that unfolding to more thoughtful sight, The harmony of their magnificence, Drew silently the worship of my youth To the grave sweetness on the brow of truth; Shall they shower blessing, with their beams divine, Down to the watcher on the stormy sea, And to the pilgrim toiling for his shrine Through some wild pass of rocky Apennine, And to the wanderer lone On wastes of Afric thrown, And not to me? Am I a thing forsaken, And is the gladness taken From the bright-pinion'd nature which hath soar'd Through realms by royal eagle ne'er explored, And, bathing there in streams of fiery light, Found strength to gaze upon the Infinite? And now an alien!—Wherefore must this be? How shall I rend the chain? How drink rich life again From those pure urns of radiance, welling free? Father of Spirits! let me turn to thee! Oh! if too much exulting in her dower, My soul, not yet to lowly thought subdued, Hath stood without thee on her hill of power— A fearful and a dazzling solitude!— And therefore from that haughty summit's crown, To dim desertion is by thee cast down; Behold! thy child submissively hath bow'd— Shine on him through the cloud! Let the now darken'd earth and curtain'd heaven Back to his vision with thy face be given! Bear him on high once more, But in thy strength to soar, And wrapt and still'd by that o'ershadowing might, Forth on the empyreal blaze to look with chasten'd sight. Or if it be, that like the ark's lone dove, My thoughts go forth, and find no resting-place, No sheltering home of sympathy and love, In the responsive bosoms of my race, And back return, a darkness and a weight, Till my unanswer'd heart grows desolate— Yet, yet sustain me, Holiest!—I am vow'd To solemn service high; And shall the spirit, for thy tasks endow'd, Sink on the threshold of the sanctuary. Fainting beneath the burden of the day, Because no human tone, Unto the altar-stone, Of that pure spousal fane inviolate, Where it should make eternal truth its mate, May cheer the sacred solitary way? Oh! be the whisper of thy voice within Enough to strengthen! Be the hope to win A more deep-seeing homage for thy name, Far, far beyond the burning dream of fame! Make me thine only!—Let me add but one To those refulgent steps all undefiled, Which glorious minds have piled Through bright self-offering, earnest, childlike, lone, For mounting to thy throne! And let my soul, upborne On wings of inner morn, Find, in illumined secresy, the sense Of that bless'd work, its own high recompense. The dimness melts away That on your glory lay, O ye majestic watchers of the skies! Through the dissolving veil, Which made each aspect pale, Your gladd'ning fires once more I recognise; And once again a shower Of hope, and joy, and power, Streams on my soul from your immortal eyes. And, if that splendour to my sober'd sight Come tremulous, with more of pensive light— Something, though beautiful, yet deeply fraught, With more that pierces through each fold of thought Than I was wont to trace On Heaven's unshadow'd face— Be it e'en so!—be mine, though set apart Unto a radiant ministry, yet still A lowly, fearful, self-distrusting heart; Bow'd before thee, O Mightiest! whose bless'd will All the pure stars rejoicingly fulfil. Written after hearing the introductory Lecture on Astronomy delivered in Trinity College, Dublin, by Sir William Hamilton, royal astronomer of Ireland, on the 8th November 1832. THE TRAVELLER'S EVENING SONG. Father, guide me! Day declines. Hollow winds are in the pines; Darkly waves each giant bough O'er the sky's last crimson glow; Hush'd is now the convent's bell, Which erewhile with breezy swell From the purple mountains bore Greeting to the sunset-shore. Now the sailor's vesper-hymn Dies away. Father! in the forest dim, Be my stay! In the low and shivering thrill Of the leaves that late hung still; In the dull and muffled tone Of the sea-wave's distant moan; In the deep tints of the sky There are signs of tempests nigh. Ominous, with sullen sound, Falls the closing dusk around. Father! through the storm and shade O'er the wild, Oh! be Thou the lone one's aid— Save thy child! Many a swift and sounding plume Homewards, through the boding gloom, O'er my way hath flitted fast, Since the farewell sunbeam pass'd From the chestnut's ruddy bark, And the pools, now lone and dark, Where the wakening night-winds sigh Through the long reeds mournfully. Homeward, homeward, all things haste— God of might! Shield the homeless 'midst the waste, Be his light! In his distant cradle nest, Now my babe is laid to rest; Beautiful his slumber seems With a glow of heavenly dreams, Beautiful, o'er that bright sleep, Hang soft eyes of fondness deep, Where his mother bends to pray For the loved and far away.— Father, guard that household bower, Hear that prayer! Back, through thine all-guiding power, Lead me there! Darker, wilder, grows the night, Not a star sends quivering light Through the massy arch of shade By the stern old forest made. Thou! to whose unslumbering eyes All my pathway open lies, By thy Son, who knew distress In the lonely wilderness, Where no roof to that bless'd head Shelter gave— Father! through the time of dread, Save—oh, save! BURIAL OF AN EMIGRANT'S CHILD IN THE FORESTS. Scene.—The banks of a solitary river in an American forest. A tent under pine-trees in the foreground. Agnes sitting before the tent, with a child in her arms apparently sleeping. Agnes. Surely 'tis all a dream—a fever-dream! The desolation and the agony— The strange red sunrise—and the gloomy woods, So terrible with their dark giant boughs, And the broad lonely river! all a dream! And my boy's voice will wake me, with its clear, Wild singing tones, as they were wont to come, Through the wreath'd sweetbrier at my lattice-panes In happy, happy England! Speak to me! Speak to thy mother, bright one! she hath watch'd All the dread night beside thee, till her brain Is darken'd by swift waves of fantasies, And her soul faint with longing for thy voice. Oh! I must wake him with one gentle kiss On his fair brow! (Shudderingly.) The strange damp thrilling touch! The marble chill! Now, now it rushes back— Now I know all!—dead—dead!—a fearful word! My boy hath left me in the wilderness, To journey on without the blessed light In his deep loving eyes—he's gone—he's gone! [Her Husband enters. Husband. Agnes, my Agnes! hast thou look'd thy last On our sweet slumberer's face? The hour is come— The couch made ready for his last repose. Agnes. Not yet! thou canst not take him from me yet! If he but left me for a few short days, This were too brief a gazing time, to draw His angel image into my fond heart, And fix its beauty there. And now—oh! now, Never again the laughter of his eye Shall send its gladd'ning summer through my soul— Never on earth again. Yet, yet delay! Thou canst not take him from me. Husband. My beloved! Is it not God hath taken him? the God That took our first-born, o'er whose early grave Thou didst bow down thy saint-like head, and say, “His will be done!” Agnes. Oh! that near household grave, Under the turf of England, seem'd not half— Not half so much to part me from my child As these dark woods. It lay beside our home, And I could watch the sunshine, through all hours, Loving and clinging to the grassy spot; And I could dress its greensward with fresh flowers— Familiar, meadow flowers. O'er thee my babe, The primrose will not blossom! Oh! that now, Together, by thy fair young sister's side, We lay 'midst England's valleys! Husband. Dost thou grieve, Agnes! that thou hast follow'd o'er the deep An exile's fortunes? If it thus can be, Then, after many a conflict cheerily met, My spirit sinks at last. Agnes. Forgive, forgive! My Edmund, pardon me! Oh! grief is wild— Forget its words, quick spray-drops from a fount Of unknown bitterness! Thou art my home! Mine only and my blessed one! Where'er Thy warm heart beats in its true nobleness, There is my country! there my head shall rest, And throb no more. Oh! still, by thy strong love, Bear up the feeble reed! [Kneeling with the child in her arms. And thou, my God! Hear my soul's cry from this dread wilderness, Oh! hear, and pardon me! If I have made This treasure, sent from thee, too much the ark Fraught with mine earthward-clinging happiness, Forgetting Him who gave, and might resume, Oh, pardon me! If nature hath rebell'd, And from thy light turn'd wilfully away, Making a midnight of her agony, When the despairing passion of her clasp Was from its idol stricken at one touch Of thine Almighty hand—oh, pardon me! By thy Son's anguish, pardon! In the soul The tempests and the waves will know thy voice— Father say, “Peace, be still!” [Giving the child to her husband. Farewell, my babe! Go from my bosom now to other rest! With this last kiss on thine unsullied brow, And on thy pale calm cheek these contrite tears, I yield thee to thy Maker! Husband. Now, my wife, Thine own meek holiness beams forth once more A light upon my path. Now shall I bear, From thy dear arms, the slumberer to repose— With a calm, trustful heart. Agnes. My Edmund! where— Where wilt thou lay him? Husband. See'st thou where the spire Of yon dark cypress reddens in the sun To burning gold?—there—o'er yon willow-tuft? Under that native desert monument Lies his lone bed. Our Hubert, since the dawn, With the grey mosses of the wilderness Hath lined it closely through; and there breathed forth, E'en from the fulness of his own pure heart, A wild, sad forest hymn—a song of tears, Which thou wilt learn to love. I heard the boy Chanting it o'er his solitary task, As wails a wood-bird to the thrilling leaves, Perchance unconsciously. Agnes. My gentle son! The affectionate, the gifted! With what joy— Edmund, rememberest thou?—with what bright joy His baby brother ever to his arms Would spring from rosy sleep, and playfully Hide the rich clusters of his gleaming hair In that kind youthful breast! Oh! now no more, But strengthen me, my God! and melt my heart, Even to a well-spring of adoring tears, For many a blessing left. (Bending over the child.) Once more farewell! Oh, the pale, piercing sweetness of that look! How can it be sustain'd? Away, away! [After a short pause.Edmund, my woman's nature still is weak— I cannot see thee render dust to dust! Go thou, my husband, to thy solemn task; I will rest here, and still my soul with prayer Till thy return. Husband. Then strength be with thy prayer! Peace on thy bosom! Faith and heavenly hope Unto thy spirit! Fare thee well a while! We must be pilgrims of the woods again, After this mournful hour. [He goes cut with the child.—Agnes kneels in prayer.—After a time, voices without are heard singing. THE FUNERAL HYMN. Where the long reeds quiver, Where the pines make moan, By the forest river, Sleeps our babe alone. England's field flowers may not deck his grave, Cypress shadows o'er him darkly wave. Woods unknown receive him, 'Midst the mighty wild; Yet with God we leave him, Blessed, blessed child! And our tears gush o'er his lovely dust, Mournfully, yet still from hearts of trust. Though his eye hath brighten'd Oft our weary way, And his clear laugh lighten'd Half our hearts' dismay; Still in hope we give back what was given, Yielding up the beautiful to Heaven. And to her who bore him, Her who long must weep, Yet shall Heaven restore him From his pale, sweet sleep! Those blue eyes of love and peace again Through her soul will shine, undimm'd by pain. Where the long reeds quiver, Where the pines make moan, Leave we by the river Earth to earth alone! God and Father! may our journeyings on Lead to where the blessed boy is gone! From the exile's sorrow, From the wanderer's dread Of the night and morrow, Early, brightly fled; Thou hast call'd him to a sweeter home Than our lost one o'er the ocean's foam. Now let thought behold him With his angel look, Where those arms enfold him, Which benignly took Israel's babes to their Good Shepherd's breast, When his voice their tender meekness blest. Turn thee now, fond mother! From thy dead, oh, turn! Linger not, young brother, Here to dream and mourn: Only kneel once more around the sod, Kneel, and bow submitted hearts to God! EASTER-DAY IN A MOUNTAIN CHURCHYARD. There is a wakening on the mighty hills, A kindling with the spirit of the morn! Bright gleams are scatter'd from the thousand rills, And a soft visionary hue is born On the young foliage, worn By all the embosom'd woods—a silvery green, Made up of Spring and dew, harmoniously serene. And lo! where floating through a glory, sings The lark, alone amidst a crystal sky! Lo! where the darkness of his buoyant wings, Against a soft and rosy cloud on high, Trembles with melody! While the far-echoing solitudes rejoice To the rich laugh of music in that voice. But purer light than of the early sun Is on you cast, O mountains of the earth! And for your dwellers nobler joy is won Than the sweet echoes of the skylark's mirth, By this glad morning's birth! And gifts more precious by its breath are shed Than music on the breeze, dew on the violet's head. Gifts for the soul, from whose illumined eye, O'er nature's face the colouring glory flows; Gifts from the fount of immortality, Which, fill'd with balm, unknown to human woes, Lay hush'd in dark repose, Till thou, bright dayspring! madest its waves our own, By thine unsealing of the burial stone. Sing, then, with all your choral strains, ye hills! And let a full victorious tone be given, By rock and cavern, to the wind which fills Your urn-like depths with sound! The tomb is riven, The radiant gate of heaven Unfolded—and the stern, dark shadow cast By death's o'ersweeping wing, from the earth's bosom past. And you, ye graves! upon whose turf I stand, Girt with the slumber of the hamlet's dead, Time with a soft and reconciling hand The covering mantle of bright moss hath spread O'er every narrow bed: But not by time, and not by nature sown Was the celestial seed, whence round you peace hath grown. Christ hath arisen! oh! not one cherish'd head Hath, 'midst the flowery sods, been pillow'd here Without a hope, (howe'er the heart hath bled In its vain yearnings o'er the unconscious bier,) A hope, upspringing clear From those majestic tidings of the morn, Which lit the living way to all of woman born. Thou hast wept mournfully, O human love! E'en on this greensward; night hath heard thy cry, Heart-stricken one! thy precious dust above, Night, and the hills, which sent forth no reply Unto thine agony! But He who wept like thee, thy Lord, thy guide, Christ hath arisen, O love! thy tears shall all be dried. Dark must have been the gushing of those tears, Heavy the unsleeping phantom of the tomb On thine impassion'd soul, in elder years When, burden'd with the mystery of its doom, Mortality's thick gloom Hung o'er the sunny world, and with the breath Of the triumphant rose came blending thoughts of death. By thee, sad Love, and by thy sister, Fear, Then was the ideal robe of beauty wrought To vail that haunting shadow, still too near, Still ruling secretly the conqueror's thought, And, where the board was fraught With wine and myrtles in the summer bower, Felt, e'en when disavow'd, a presence and a power. But that dark night is closed: and o'er the dead, Here, where the gleamy primrose tufts have blown, And where the mountain-heath a couch has spread, And, settling oft on some grey letter'd stone, The redbreast warbles lone; And the wild-bee's deep drowsy murmurs pass, Like a low thrill of harp-strings, through the grass: Here, 'midst the chambers of the Christian's sleep, We o'er death's gulf may look with trusting eye, For hope sits, dovelike, on the gloomy deep, And the green hills wherein these valleys lie Seem all one sanctuary Of holiest thought—nor needs their fresh bright sod, Urn, wreath, or shrine, for tombs all dedicate to God. Christ hath arisen!—O mountain peaks! attest, Witness, resounding glen and torrent wave, The immortal courage in the human breast Sprung from that victory—tell how oft the brave To camp 'midst rock and cave, Nerved by those words, their struggling faith have borne, Planting the cross on high above the clouds of morn! The Alps have heard sweet hymnings for to-day— Ay, and wild sounds of sterner, deeper tone, Have thrill'd their pines, when those that knelt to pray Rose up to arm! the pure high snows have known A colouring not their own, But from true hearts which by that crimson stain Gave token of a trust that call'd no suffering vain. Those days are past—the mountains wear no more The solemn splendour of the martyr's blood, And may that awful record, as of yore, Never again be known to field or flood! E'en though the faithful stood, A noble army, in the exulting sight Of earth and heaven, which bless'd their battle for the right! But many a martyrdom by hearts unshaken Is yet borne silently in homes obscure; And many a bitter cup is meekly taken; And, for the strength whereby the just and pure Thus steadfastly endure, Glory to Him whose victory won that dower, Him, from whose rising stream'd that robe of spirit power. Glory to Him! Hope to the suffering breast! Light to the nations! He hath roll'd away The mists, which, gathering into deathlike rest, Between the soul and heaven's calm ether lay— His love hath made it day With those that sat in darkness.—Earth and sea! Lift up glad strains for man by truth divine made free! THE CHILD READING THE BIBLE. “A dancing shape, an image gay, To haunt, to startle, to waylay. A being breathing thoughtful breath, A traveller between life and death.” Wordsworth. I saw him at his sport erewhile, The bright exulting boy, Like Summer's lightning came the smile Of his young spirit's joy; A flash that wheresoe'er it broke, To life undreamt-of beauty woke. His fair locks waved in sunny play, By a clear fountain's side, Where jewel-colour'd pebbles lay Beneath the shallow tide; And pearly spray at times would meet The glancing of his fairy feet. He twined him wreaths of all Spring-flowers, Which drank that streamlet's dew; He flung them o'er the wave in showers, Till, gazing, scarce I knew Which seem'd more pure, or bright, or wild, The singing fount or laughing child. To look on all that joy and bloom Made earth one festal scene, Where the dull shadow of the tomb Seem'd as it ne'er had been. How could one image of decay Steal o'er the dawn of such clear day? I saw once more that aspect bright— The boy's meek head was bow'd In silence o'er the Book of Light, And, like a golden cloud— The still cloud of a pictured sky— His locks droop'd round it lovingly. And if my heart had deem'd him fair, When in the fountain glade, A creature of the sky and air, Almost on wings he play'd; Oh! how much holier beauty now Lit the young human being's brow! The being born to toil, to die, To break forth from the tomb, Unto far nobler destiny Than waits the skylark's plume! I saw him, in that thoughtful hour, Win the first knowledge of his dower. The soul, the awakening soul I saw, My watching eye could trace The shadows of its new-born awe, Sweeping o'er that fair face: As o'er a flower might pass the shade By some dread angel's pinion made! The soul, the mother of deep fears, Of high hopes infinite, Of glorious dreams, mysterious tears, Of sleepless inner sight; Lovely, but solemn, it arose, Unfolding what no more might close. The red-leaved tablets, “All this, and more than this, is now engraved upon the red-leaved tablets of my heart.”—Haywood. undefiled, As yet, by evil thought— Oh! little dream'd the brooding child, Of what within me wrought, While his young heart first burn'd and stirr'd, And quiver'd to the eternal word. And reverently my spirit caught The reverence of his gaze; A sight with dew of blessing fraught To hallow after-days; To make the proud heart meekly wise, By the sweet faith in those calm eyes. It seem'd as if a temple rose Before me brightly there, And in the depths of its repose My soul o'erflow'd with prayer, Feeling a solemn presence nigh— The power of infant sanctity! O Father! mould my heart once more, By thy prevailing breath! Teach me, oh! teach me to adore E'en with that pure one's faith; A faith, all made of love and light, Child-like, and therefore full of might! A POET'S DYING HYMN. “Be mute who will, who can, Yet I will praise thee with impassion'd voice! Me didst thou constitute a priest of thine In such a temple as we now behold, Rear'd for thy presence; therefore am I bound To worship, here and every where.” Wordsworth. The blue, deep, glorious heavens!—I lift mine eye, And bless thee, O my God! that I have met And own'd thine image in the majesty Of their calm temple still!—that never yet There hath thy face been shrouded from my sight By noontide blaze, or sweeping storm of night: I bless thee, O my God! That now still clearer, from their pure expanse, I see the mercy of thine aspect shine, Touching death's features with a lovely glance Of light, serenely, solemnly divine, And lending to each holy star a ray As of kind eyes, that woo my soul away: I bless thee, O my God! That I have heard thy voice, nor been afraid, In the earth's garden—'midst the mountains old And the low thrillings of the forest-shade, And the wild sound of waters uncontroll'd— And upon many a desert plain and shore— No solitude—for there I felt thee more: I bless thee, O my God! And if thy spirit on thy child hath shed The gift, the vision of the unseal'd eye, To pierce the mist o'er life's deep meanings spread, To reach the hidden fountain-urns that lie Far in man's heart—if I have kept it free And pure—a consecration unto thee: I bless thee, O my God! If my soul's utterance hath by thee been fraught With an awakening power—if thou hast made, Like the wing'd seed, the breathings of my thought, And by the swift winds bid them be convey'd To lands of other lays, and there become Native as early melodies of home: I bless thee, O my God! Not for the brightness of a mortal wreath, Not for a place 'midst kingly minstrels dead, But that perchance, a faint gale of thy breath, A still small whisper in my song hath led One struggling spirit upwards to thy throne, Or but one hope, one prayer:—for this alone I bless thee, O my God! That I have loved—that I have known the love Which troubles in the soul the tearful springs, Yet, with a colouring halo from above, Tinges and glorifies all earthly things, Whate'er its anguish or its woe may be, Still weaving links for intercourse with thee: I bless thee, O my God! That by the passion of its deep distress, And by the o'erflowing of its mighty prayer, And by the yearning of its tenderness, Too full for words upon their stream to bear, I have been drawn still closer to thy shrine, Well-spring of love, the unfathom'd, the divine; I bless thee, O my God! That hope hath ne'er my heart or song forsaken, High hope, which even from mystery, doubt, or dread, Calm, rejoicingly, the things hath taken Whereby its torchlight for the race was fed: That passing storms have only fann'd the fire, Which pierced them still with its triumphal spire, I bless thee, O my God! Now art thou calling me in every gale, Each sound and token of the dying day: Thou leavest me not, though early life grows pale, I am not darkly sinking to decay; But, hour by hour, my soul's dissolving shroud Melts off to radiance, as a silvery cloud. I bless thee, O my God! And if this earth, with all its choral streams, And crowning woods, and soft or solemn skies, And mountain sanctuaries for poet's dreams, Be lovely still in my departing eyes— 'Tis not that fondly I would linger here, But that thy foot-prints on its dust appear: I bless thee, O my God! And that the tender shadowing I behold, The tracery veining every leaf and flower, Of glories cast in more consummate mould, No longer vassals to the changeful hour; That life's last roses to my thoughts can bring Rich visions of imperishable spring: I bless thee, O my God! Yes! the young vernal voices in the skies Woo me not back, but, wandering past mine ear, Seem heralds of th' eternal melodies, The spirit-music, imperturb'd and clear; The full of soul, yet passionate no more— Let me, too, joining those pure strains, adore! I bless thee, O my God! Now aid, sustain me still!—to thee I come, Make thou my dwelling where thy children are! And for the hope of that immortal home, And for thy Son, the bright and morning star, The sufferer and the victor-king of death, I bless thee with my glad song's dying breath! I bless thee, O my God! THE FUNERAL DAY OF SIR WALTER SCOTT. “Many an eye May wail the dimming of our shining star.” Shakspeare. A glorious voice hath ceased!— Mournfully, reverently—the funeral chant Breathe reverently! There is a dreamy sound, A hollow murmur of the dying year, In the deep woods. Let it be wild and sad! A more Æolian melancholy tone Than ever wail'd o'er bright things perishing! For that is passing from the darken'd land, Which the green summer will not bring us back— Though all her songs return. The funeral chant Breathe reverently!—They bear the mighty forth, The kingly ruler in the realms of mind— They bear him through the household paths, the groves, Where every tree had music of its own To his quick ear of knowledge taught by love— And he is silent!—Past the living stream They bear him now; the stream, whose kindly voice On alien shores his true heart burn'd to hear— And he is silent! O'er the heathery hills, Which his own soul had mantled with a light Richer than autumn's purple, now they move— And he is silent!—he, whose flexile lips Were but unseal'd, and lo! a thousand forms, From every pastoral glen and fern-clad height, In glowing life upsprang:—Vassal and chief, Rider and steed, with shout and bugle-peal, Fast rushing through the brightly troubled air, Like the wild huntsman's band. And still they live, To those fair scenes imperishably bound, And, from the mountain mist still flashing by, Startle the wanderer who hath listen'd there To the seer's voice: phantoms of colour'd thought, Surviving him who raised.—O eloquence! O power, whose breathings thus could wake the dead! Who shall wake thee? lord of the buried past! And art thou there—to those dim nations join'd, Thy subject-host so long?—The wand is dropp'd, The bright lamp broken, which the gifted hand Touch'd, and the genii came!—Sing reverently The funeral chant!—The mighty is borne home— And who shall be his mourners?—Youth and age, For each hath felt his magic—love and grief, For he hath communed with the heart of each: Yes—the free spirit of humanity May join the august procession, for to him Its mysteries have been tributary things, And all its accents known:—from field or wave, Never was conqueror on his battle bier, By the vail'd banner and the muffled drum, And the proud drooping of the crested head, More nobly follow'd home.—The last abode, The voiceless dwelling of the bard is reach'd: A still majestic spot: girt solemnly With all th' imploring beauty of decay; A stately couch 'midst ruins! meet for him With his bright fame to rest in, as a king Of other days, laid lonely with his sword Beneath his head. Sing reverently the chant Over the honour'd grave!—the grave!—oh, say Rather the shrine!—An altar for the love, The light, soft pilgrim steps, the votive wreaths Of years unborn—a place where leaf and flower, By that which dies not of the sovereign dead, Shall be made holy things—where every weed Shall have its portion of th' inspiring gift From buried glory breathed. And now, what strain, Making victorious melody ascend High above sorrow's dirge, befits the tomb Where he that sway'd the nations thus is laid— The crown'd of men? A lowly, lowly song. Lowly and solemn be Thy children's cry to thee, Father divine! A hymn of suppliant breath, Owning that life and death Alike are thine! A spirit on its way, Sceptred the earth to sway, From thee was sent: Now call'st thou back thine own— Hence is that radiance flown— To earth but lent. Watching in breathless awe, The bright head bow'd we saw, Beneath thy hand! Fill'd by one hope, one fear, Now o'er a brother's bier, Weeping we stand. How hath he pass'd!—the lord Of each deep bosom chord, To meet thy sight, Unmantled and alone, On thy bless'd mercy thrown, O Infinite! So, from his harvest home, Must the tired peasant come; So, in one trust, Leader and king must yield The naked soul, reveal'd To thee, All Just! The sword of many a fight— What then shall be its might? The lofty lay, That rush'd on eagle wing— What shall its memory bring? What hope, what stay? O Father! in that hour, When earth all succouring power Shall disavow; When spear, and shield, and crown, In faintness are cast down— Sustain us, Thou! By Him who bow'd to take The death-cup for our sake, The thorn, the rod; From whom the last dismay Was not to pass away— Aid us, O God! Tremblers beside the grave, We call on thee to save. Father divine! Hear, hear our suppliant breath, Keep us, in life and death, Thine, only thine! THE PRAYER IN THE WILDERNESS. SUGGESTED BY A PICTURE OF CORREGIO'S. In the deep wilderness unseen she pray'd, The daughter of Jerusalem; alone, With all the still small whispers of the night, And with the searching glances of the stars, And with her God, alone:—she lifted up Her sweet, sad voice, and, trembling o'er her head, The dark leaves thrill'd with prayer—the tearful prayer Of woman's quenchless, yet repentant love. Father of Spirits, hear! Look on the inmost heart to thee reveal'd, Look on the fountain of the burning tear, Before thy sight in solitude unseal'd! Hear, Father! hear, and aid! If I have loved too well, if I have shed, In my vain fondness, o'er a mortal head, Gifts, on thy shrine my God! more fitly laid. If I have sought to live But in one light, and made a human eye The lonely star of mine idolatry, Thou that art Love! oh, pity and forgive! Chasten'd and school'd at last, No more, no more my struggling spirit burns, But fix'd on thee, from that wild worship turns— What have I said?—the deep dream is not past! Yet hear!—if still I love, Oh! still too fondly—if, for ever seen, An earthly image comes, my heart between, And thy calm glory, Father, throned above. If still a voice is near, (E'en while I strive these wanderings to control,) An earthly voice, disquieting my soul With its deep music, too intensely dear. O Father! draw to thee My lost affections back!—the dreaming eyes Clear from their mist—sustain the heart that dies, Give the worn soul once more its pinions free! I must love on, O God! This bosom must love on!—but let thy breath Touch and make pure the flame that knows not death, Bearing it up to heaven—love's own abode! Ages and ages past, the wilderness, With its dark cedars, and the thrilling night, With her clear stars, and the mysterious winds, That waft all sound, were conscious of those prayers. How many such hath woman's bursting heart Since then, in silence and in darkness breathed, Like the dim night-flower's odour, up to God! PRISONERS' EVENING SERVICE. A SCENE OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. The last days of two prisoners in the Luxembourg, Sillery and La Source, so affectingly described by Helen Maria Williams, in her Letters from France, gave rise to this little scene. These two victims had composed a simple hymn, which they every night sung together in a low and restrained voice. “From their spheres The stars of human glory are cast down; Perish the roses and the flowers of kings, Princes and emperors, and the crown and palms Of all the mighty, wither'd and consumed! Nor is power given to lowliest innocence Long to protect her own.” Wordsworth. Scene—Prison of the Luxembourg, in Paris, during the Reign of Terror. D'Aubigne, an aged Royalist—Blanche, his daughter, a young girl. Blanche. What was our doom, my father? In thine arms I lay unconsciously through that dread hour. Tell me the sentence! Could our judges look, Without relenting, on thy silvery hair? Was there not mercy, father? Will they not Restore us to our home? D'Aubigné. Yes, my poor child! They send us home. Blanche. Oh! shall we gaze again On the bright Loire? Will the old hamlet spire, And the grey turret of our own chateau, Look forth to greet us through the dusky elms? Will the kind voices of our villagers, The loving laughter in their children's eyes, Welcome us back at last?—But how is this?— Father, thy glance is clouded—on thy brow There sits no joy! D'Aubigné. Upon my brow, dear girl, There sits, I trust, such deep and solemn peace As may befit the Christian, who receives And recognises, in submissive awe, The summons of his God. Blanche. Thou dost not mean— No, no! it cannot be!—Didst thou not say They sent us home? D'Aubigné. Where is the spirit's home?— Oh! most of all, in these dark evil days, Where should it be—but in that world serene, Beyond the sword's reach, and the tempest's power— Where, but in Heaven? Blanche. My father! D'Aubigné. We must die. We must look up to God, and calmly die.— Come to my heart, and weep there!—for awhile Give Nature's passion way, then brightly rise In the still courage of a woman's heart! Do I not know thee?—Do I ask too much From mine own noble Blanche? Blanche, (falling on his bosom.) Oh! clasp me fast! Thy trembling child!—Hide, hide me in thine arms— Father! D'Aubigné. Alas! my flower, thou'rt young to go— Young, and so fair!—Yet were it worse, methinks, To leave thee where the gentle and the brave, The loyal-hearted and the chivalrous, And they that loved their God, have all been swept, Like the sere leaves, away.—For them no hearth Through the wide land was left inviolate, No altar holy; therefore did they fall, Rejoicing to depart.—The soil is steep'd In noble blood; the temples are gone down; The voice of prayer is hush'd, or fearfully Mutter'd, like sounds of guilt.—Why, who would live? Who hath not panted, as a dove, to flee, To quit for ever the dishonour'd soil, The burden'd air?—Our God upon the cross— Our king upon the scaffold A French royalist officer, dying upon a field of battle, and hearing some one near him uttering the most plaintive lamentations, turned towards the sufferer, and thus addressed him:—“My friend, whoever you may be, remember that your God expired upon the cross—your king upon the scaffold—and he who now speaks to you has had his limbs shot from under him. Meet your fate as becomes a man.”—let us think Of these—and fold endurance to our hearts, And bravely die! Blanche. A dark and fearful way! An evil doom for thy dear honour'd head! Oh! thou, the kind, the gracious!—whom all eyes Bless'd as they look'd upon!—Speak yet again— Say, will they part us? D'Aubigné. No, my Blanche; in death We shall not be divided. Blanche. Thanks to God! He, by thy glance, will aid me—I shall see His light before me to the last.—And when— O pardon these weak shrinkings of thy child!— When shall the hour befall? D'Aubigné. Oh! swiftly now, And suddenly, with brief dread interval, Comes down the mortal stroke.—But of that hour As yet I know not.—Each low throbbing pulse Of the quick pendulum may usher in Eternity! Blanche, (kneeling before him.) My father! lay thy hand On thy poor Blanche's head, and once again Bless her with thy deep voice of tenderness, Thus breathing saintly courage through her soul, Ere we are call'd. D'Aubigné. If I may speak through tears!— Well may I bless thee, fondly, fervently, Child of my heart!—thou who dost look on me With thy lost mother's angel eyes of love! Thou that hast been a brightness in my path, A guest of Heaven unto my lonely soul, A stainless lily in my widow'd house, There springing up—with soft light round thee shed— For immortality!—Meek child of God! I bless thee—He will bless thee!—In his love He calls thee now from this rude stormy world To thy Redeemer's breast!—And thou wilt die, As thou hast lived—my duteous, holy Blanche! In trusting and serene submissiveness, Humble, yet full of Heaven. Blanche, (rising.) Now is there strength Infused through all my spirit.—I can rise And say, “Thy will be done!” D'Aubigné, (pointing upwards.) See'st thou, my child, Yon faint light in the west? The signal star Of our due vesper service, gleaming in Through the close dungeon grating!—Mournfully It seems to quiver; yet shall this night pass, This night alone, without the lifted voice Of adoration in our narrow cell, As if unworthy fear or wavering faith Silenced the strain?—No! let it waft to heaven The prayer, the hope, of poor mortality, In its dark hour once more!—And we will sleep— Yes—calmly sleep, when our last rite is closed. [They sing together. PRISONERS' EVENING HYMN. We see no more in thy pure skies, How soft, O God! the sunset dies; How every colour'd hill and wood Seems melting in the golden flood: Yet, by the precious memories won From bright hours now for ever gone, Father! o'er all thy works, we know, Thou still art shedding beauty's glow; Still touching every cloud and tree With glory, eloquent of Thee; Still feeding all thy flowers with light, Though man hath barr'd it from our sight. We know Thou reign'st, the Unchanging One, th' All Just! And bless thee still with free and boundless trust! We read no more, O God! thy ways On earth, in these wild evil days. The red sword in the oppressor's hand Is ruler of the weeping land; Fallen are the faithful and the pure, No shrine is spared, no hearth secure. Yet, by the deep voice from the past, Which tells us these things cannot last— And by the hope which finds no ark, Save in thy breast, when storms grow dark— We trust thee!—As the sailor knows That in its place of bright repose His pole-star burns, though mist and cloud May veil it with a midnight shroud. We know thou reign'st—All holy one, all just! And bless thee still with love's own boundless trust. We feel no more that aid is nigh, When our faint hearts within us die. We suffer—and we know our doom Must be one suffering till the tomb. Yet, by the anguish of thy Son When his last hour came darkly on— By his dread cry, the air which rent In terror of abandonment— And by his parting word, which rose Through faith victorious o'er all woes— We know that Thou may'st wound, may'st break The spirit, but wilt ne'er forsake! Sad suppliants whom our brethren spurn, In our deep need to Thee we turn! To whom but Thee!—All merciful, all just! In life, in death, we yield thee boundless trust! HYMN OF THE VAUDOIS MOUNTAINEERS IN TIMES OF PERSECUTION. “Thanks be to God for the mountains.” Howitt's Book of the Seasons. For the strength of the hills we bless thee, Our God, our fathers' God! Thou hast made thy children mighty, By the touch of the mountain sod. Thou hast fix'd our ark of refuge Where the spoiler's foot ne'er trod; For the strength of the hills we bless thee, Our God, our fathers' God! We are watchers of a beacon Whose light must never die; We are guardians of an altar 'Midst the silence of the sky: The rocks yield founts of courage, Struck forth as by thy rod; For the strength of the hills we bless thee, Our God, our fathers' God! For the dark resounding caverns, Where thy still, small voice is heard; For the strong pines of the forests, That by thy breath are stirr'd; For the storms, on whose free pinions Thy spirit walks abroad; For the strength of the hills we bless thee, Our God, our fathers' God! The royal eagle darteth On his quarry from the heights, And the stag that knows no master, Seeks there his wild delights; But we, for thy communion, Have sought the mountain sod; For the strength of the hills we bless thee, Our God, our fathers' God! The banner of the chieftain, Far, far below us waves; The war-horse of the spearman Cannot reach our lofty caves: Thy dark clouds wrap the threshold Of freedom's last abode; For the strength of the hills we bless thee, Our God, our fathers' God! For the shadow of thy presence, Round our camp of rock outspread; For the stern defiles of battle, Bearing record of our dead; For the snows and for the torrents, For the free heart's burial-sod; For the strength of the hills we bless thee, Our God, our fathers' God! THE INDIAN'S REVENGE. SCENE IN THE LIFE OF A MORAVIAN MISSIONARY. Circumstances similar to those on which this scene is founded, are recorded in Carne's Narrative of the Moravian Missions in Greenland, and gave rise to the dramatic sketch. “But by my wrongs and by my wrath, To-morrow Areouski's breath That fires yon heaven with storms of death, Shall light me to the foe!” Indian Song in “Gertrude of Wyoming.” Scene.—The shore of a Lake surrounded by deep woods. A solitary cabin on its banks, overshadowed by maple and sycamore trees. Herrmann, the missionary, seated alone before the cabin. The hour is evening twilight. Herrmann. Was that the light from some lone swift canoe Shooting across the waters?—No, a flash From the night's first quick fire-fly, lost again In the deep bay of cedars. Not a bark Is on the wave; no rustle of a breeze Comes through the forest. In this new, strange world, Oh! how mysterious, how eternal, seems The mighty melancholy of the woods! The desert's own great spirit, infinite! Little they know, in mine own fatherland, Along the castled Rhine, or e'en amidst The wild Harz mountains, or the silvan glades Deep in the Odenwald, they little know Of what is solitude! In hours like this, There, from a thousand nooks, the cottage-hearths Pour forth red light through vine-hung lattices, To guide the peasant, singing cheerily, On the home path; while round his lowly porch, With eager eyes awaiting his return, The cluster'd faces of his children shine To the clear harvest moon. Be still, fond thoughts! Melting my spirit's grasp from heavenly hope By your vain earthward yearnings. O my God! Draw me still nearer, closer unto thee, Till all the hollow of these deep desires May with thyself be fill'd!—Be it enough At once to gladden and to solemnize My lonely life, if for thine altar here In this dread temple of the wilderness, By prayer, and toil, and watching, I may win The offering of one heart, one human heart, Bleeding, repenting, loving! Hark! a step, An Indian tread! I know the stealthy sound— Tis on some quest of evil, through the grass Gliding so serpent-like. [He comes forward, and meets an Indian warrior armed. Enonio, is it thou? I see thy form Tower stately through the dusk, yet scarce mine eye Discerns thy face. Enonio. My father speaks my name. Herrmann. Are not the hunters from the chase returned? The night-fires lit? Why is my son abroad? Enonio. The warrior's arrow knows of nobler prey Than elk or deer. Now let my father leave The lone path free. Herrmann. The forest way is long From the red chieftain's home. Rest thee awhile Beneath my sycamore, and we will speak Of these things further. Enonio. Tell me not of rest! My heart is sleepless, and the dark night swift.— I must begone. Herrmann, (solemnly.) No, warrior, thou must stay! The Mighty One hath given me power to search Thy soul with piercing words—and thou must stay, And hear me, and give answer! If thy heart Be grown thus restless, is it not because Within its dark folds thou hast mantled up Some burning thought of ill?— Enonio, (with sudden impetuosity.) How should I rest?— Last night the spirit of my brother came, An angry shadow in the moonlight streak, And said, “Avenge me!”—In the clouds this morn I saw the frowning colour of his blood— And that, too, had a voice.—I lay at noon Alone beside the sounding waterfall, And through its thunder-music spake a tone— A low tone piercing all the roll of waves— And said “Avenge me!”—Therefore have I raised The tomahawk, and strung the bow again, That I may send the shadow from my couch, And take the strange sound from the cataract, And sleep once more. Herrmann. A better path, my son, Unto the still and dewy land of sleep, My hand in peace can guide thee—e'en the way Thy dying brother trod,—Say, didst thou love That lost one well? Enonio. Know'st thou not we grew up Even as twin roes amidst the wilderness? Unto the chase we journey'd in one path; We stemm'd the lake in one canoe; we lay Beneath one oak to rest. When fever hung Upon my burning lips, my brother's hand Was still beneath my head; my brother's robe Cover'd my bosom from the chill night air. Our lives were girdled by one belt of love Until he turn'd him from his father's gods, And then my soul fell from him—then the grass Grew in the way between our parted homes, And wheresoe'er I wander'd, then it seem'd That all the woods were silent.—I went forth— I journey'd, with my lonely heart, afar, And so return'd—and where was he?—the earth Own'd him no more. Herrmann. But thou thyself, since then, Hast turn'd thee from the idols of thy tribe, And, like thy brother, bow'd the suppliant knee To the one God. Enonio. Yes, I have learn'd to pray With my white father's words, yet all the more My heart, that shut against my brother's love, Hath been within me as an arrowy fire, Burning my sleep away.—In the night hush, 'Midst the strange whispers and dim shadowy things Of the great forests, I have call'd aloud, “Brother! forgive, forgive!”—He answer'd not— His deep voice, rising from the land of souls, Cries but “Avenge me!”—and I go forth now To slay his murderer, that when next his eyes Gleam on me mournfully from that pale shore, I may look up, and meet their glance, and say, “I have avenged thee.” Herrmann. Oh! that human love Should be the root of this dread bitterness, Till heaven through all the fever'd being pours Transmuting balsam!—Stay, Enonio, stay! Thy brother calls thee not!—The spirit world Where the departed go, sends back to earth No visitants for evil.—'Tis the might Of the strong passion, the remorseful grief At work in thine own breast, which lends the voice Unto the forest and the cataract, The angry colour to the clouds of morn, The shadow to the moonlight.—Stay, my son! Thy brother is at peace.—Beside his couch, When of the murderer's poison'd shaft he died, I knelt and pray'd; he named his Saviour's name, Meekly, beseechingly; he spoke of thee In pity and in love. Enonio, (hurriedly.) Did he not say My arrow should avenge him? Herrmann. His last words Were all forgiveness. Enonio. What! and shall the man Who pierced him with the shaft of treachery, Walk fearless forth in joy? Herrmann. Was he not once Thy brother's friend?—Oh! trust me, not in joy He walks the frowning forest. Did keen love, Too late repentant of its heart estranged, Wake in thy haunted bosom, with its train Of sounds and shadows—and shall he escape? Enonio, dream it not!—Our God, the All Just, Unto himself reserves this royalty— The secret chastening of the guilty heart, The fiery touch, the scourge that purifies, Leave it with him!—Yet make it not thy hope— For that strong heart of thine—Oh! listen yet— Must, in its depths, o'ercome the very wish For death or torture to the guilty one, Ere it can sleep again. Enonio. My father speaks Of change, for man too mighty. Herrmann. I but speak Of that which hath been, and again must be, If thou would'st join thy brother, in the life Of the bright country, where, I well believe, His soul rejoices.—He had known such change. He died in peace. He, whom his tribe once named The Avenging Eagle, took to his meek heart, In its last pangs, the spirit of those words Which, from the Saviour's cross, went up to heaven— “Forgive them, for they know not what they do, Father, forgive!”—And o'er the eternal bounds Of that celestial kingdom, undefiled, Where evil may not enter, he, I deem, Hath to his Master pass'd.—He waits thee there— For love, we trust, springs heavenward from the grave, Immortal in its holiness.—He calls His brother to the land of golden light And ever-living fountains—could'st thou hear His voice o'er those bright waters, it would say, “My brother! oh! be pure, be merciful! That we may meet again.” Enonio, (hesitating.) Can I return Unto my tribe, and unavenged? Herrmann. To Him, To Him return, from whom thine erring steps Have wander'd far and long!—Return, my son, To thy Redeemer!—Died he not in love— The sinless, the divine, the Son of God— Breathing forgiveness 'midst all agonies, And we, dare we be ruthless? By his aid Shalt thou be guided to thy brother's place 'Midst the pure spirits. Oh! retrace the way Back to thy Saviour! he rejects no heart E'en with the dark stains on it, if true tears Be o'er them shower'd.—Ay, weep, thou Indian chief! For, by the kindling moonlight, I behold Thy proud lip's working—weep, relieve thy soul! Tears will not shame thy manhood, in the hour Of its great conflict. Enonio, (giving up his weapons to Herrmann.) Father, take the bow, Keep the sharp arrows till the hunters call Forth to the chase once more.—And let me dwell A little while, my father! by thy side, That I may hear the blessed words again— Like water brooks amidst the summer hills— From thy true lips flow forth; for in my heart The music and the memory of their sound Too long have died away. Herrmann. O, welcome back, Friend, rescued one!—Yes, thou shalt be my guest, And we will pray beneath my sycamore Together, morn and eve; and I will spread Thy couch beside my fire, and sleep at last— After the visiting of holy thoughts— With dewy wing shall sink upon thine eyes!— Enter my home, and welcome, welcome back To peace, to God, thou lost and found again! [They go into the cabin together.—Herrmann, lingering for a moment on the threshold, looks up to the starry skies. Father! that from amidst yon glorious worlds Now look'st on us, thy children! make this hour Blessed for ever! May it see the birth Of thine own image in the unfathom'd deep Of an immortal soul;—a thing to name With reverential thought, a solemn world! To Thee more precious than those thousand stars Burning on high in thy majestic Heaven! PRAYER AT SEA AFTER VICTORY. “The land shall never rue, So England to herself do prove but true.” Shakspeare. Through evening's bright repose A voice of prayer arose, When the sea-fight was done: The sons of England knelt, With hearts that now could melt, For on the wave her battle had been won. Round their tall ship, the main Heaved with a dark red stain, Caught not from sunset's cloud; While with the tide swept past Pennon and shiver'd mast, Which to the Ocean Queen that day had bow'd. But free and fair on high, A native of the sky, Her streamer met the breeze; It flow'd o'er fearless men, Though hush'd and child-like then, Before their God they gather'd on the seas. Oh! did not thoughts of home O'er each bold spirit come As, from the land, sweet gales? In every word of prayer Had not some hearth a share, Some bower, inviolate 'midst England's vales? Yes! bright green spots that lay In beauty far away, Hearing no billows roar; Safer from touch of spoil, For that day's fiery toil, Rose on high hearts, that now with love gush'd o'er. A solemn scene and dread! The victors and the dead, The breathless burning sky! And, passing with the race Of waves that keep no trace, The wild, brief signs of human victory! A stern, yet holy scene! Billows, where strife hath been, Sinking to awful sleep; And words, that breathe the sense Of God's omnipotence, Making a minster of that silent deep. Borne through such hours afar, Thy flag hath been a star, Where eagle's wing ne'er flew:— England! the unprofaned, Thou of the hearths unstain'd, Oh! to the banner and the shrine be true! EVENING SONG OF THE WEARY. Father of heaven and earth! I bless thee for the night, The soft, still night! The holy pause of care and mirth, Of sound and light! Now, far in glade and dell, Flower-cup, and bud, and bell, Have shut around the sleeping woodlark's nest— The bee's long murmuring toils are done, And I, the o'erwearied one, O'erwearied and o'erwrought, Bless thee, O God! O Father of the oppress'd, With my last waking thought, In the still night! Yes, e'er I sink to rest, By the fire's dying light, Thou Lord of earth and heaven! I bless thee, who hast given Unto life's fainting travellers, the night, The soft, still, holy night! THE DAY OF FLOWERS. A MOTHER'S WALK WITH HER CHILD. “One spirit—His Who wore the platted thorn with bleeding brows, Rules universal nature.—Not a flower But shows some touch, in freckle, freak, or stain, Of his unrivall'd pencil. He inspires Their balmy odours, and imparts their hues, And bathes their eyes with nectar. Happy who walks with him!” Cowper. Come to the woods, my boy! Come to the streams and bowery dingles forth, My happy child! The spirit of bright hours Woos us in every wind; fresh wild-leaf scents From thickets where the lonely stock-dove broods, Enter our lattice; fitful songs of joy Float in with each soft current of the air; And we will hear their summons; we will give One day to flowers, and sunshine, and glad thoughts, And thou shalt revel 'midst free nature's wealth, And for thy mother twine wild wreaths; while she From thy delight, wins to her own fond heart The vernal extasy of childhood back: Come to the woods, my boy! What! wouldst thou lead already to the path Along the copsewood brook? Come, then! in truth Meet playmate for a child, a blessed child, Is a glad singing stream, heard or unheard, Singing its melody of happiness Amidst the reeds, and bounding in free grace To that sweet chime. With what a sparkling life It fills the shadowy dingle!—now the wing Of some low skimming swallow shakes bright spray Forth to the sunshine from its dimpled wave; Now, from some pool of crystal darkness deep, The trout springs upward, with a showery gleam And plashing sound of waters. What swift rings Of mazy insects o'er the shallow tide Seem, as they glance, to scatter sparks of light From burnish'd films! And mark yon silvery line Of gossamer, so tremulously hung Across the narrow current, from the tuft Of hazels to the hoary poplar's bough! See, in the air's transparence, how it waves, Quivering and glistening with each faintest gale, Yet breaking not—a bridge for fairy shapes, How delicate, how wondrous! Yes, my boy! Well may we make the stream's bright winding vein Our woodland guide, for He who made the stream Made it a clue to haunts of loveliness, For ever deepening. Oh, forget him not, Dear child! that airy gladness which thou feel'st Wafting thee after bird and butterfly, As 'twere a breeze within thee, is not less His gift, his blessing on thy spring-time hours, Than this rich outward sunshine, mantling all The leaves, and grass, and mossy tinted stones With summer glory. Stay thy bounding step My merry wanderer! let us rest a while By this clear pool, where, in the shadow flung From alder boughs and osiers o'er its breast, The soft red of the flowering willow-herb So vividly is pictured. Seems it not E'en melting to a more transparent glow In that pure glass? Oh! beautiful are streams! And, through all ages, human hearts have loved Their music, still accordant with each mood Of sadness or of joy. And love hath grown Into vain worship, which hath left its trace On sculptured urn and altar, gleaming still Beneath dim olive boughs, by many a fount Of Italy and Greece. But we will take Our lesson e'en from erring hearts, which bless'd The river deities or fountain nymphs, For the cool breeze, and for the freshening shade, And the sweet water's tune. The One supreme, The all-sustaining, ever-present God, Who dower'd the soul with immortality, Gave also these delights, to cheer on earth Its fleeting passage; therefore let us greet Each wandering flower scent as a boon from Him, Each bird-note, quivering 'midst light summer leaves, And every rich celestial tint unnamed, Wherewith transpierced, the clouds of morn and eve, Kindle and melt away! And now, in love, In grateful thoughts rejoicing, let us bend Our footsteps onward to the dell of flowers Around the ruin'd mansion. Thou, my boy, Not yet, I deem, hast visited that lorn But lovely spot, whose loveliness for thee Will wear no shadow of subduing thought— No colouring from the past. This way our path Winds through the hazels;—mark how brightly shoots The dragon-fly along the sunbeam's line, Crossing the leafy gloom. How full of life, The life of song, and breezes, and free wings, Is all the murmuring shade! and thine, O thine! Of all the brightest and the happiest here, My blessed child! my gift of God! that makest My heart o'erflow with summer! Hast thou twined Thy wreath so soon! yet will we loiter not, Though here the blue-bell wave, and gorgeously Round the brown twisted roots of yon scathed oak The heath-flower spread its purple. We must leave The copse, and through yon broken avenue, Shadow'd by drooping walnut foliage, reach The ruin's glade. And, lo! before us fair, Yet desolate, amidst the golden day, It stands, that house of silence! wedded now To verdant nature by the o'ermantling growth Of leaf and tendril, which fond woman's hands Once loved to train. How the rich wallflower scent From every niche and mossy cornice floats, Embalming its decay! The bee alone Is murmuring from its casement, whence no more Shall the sweet eyes of laughing children shine, Watching some homeward footstep. See! unbound From the old fretted stone-work, what thick wreaths Of jasmine, borne by waste exuberance down, Trail through the grass their gleaming stars, and load The air with mournful fragrance, for it speaks Of life gone hence; and the faint southern breath Of myrtle leaves from yon forsaken porch, Startles the soul with sweetness! Yet rich knots Of garden flowers, far wandering, and self-sown Through all the sunny hollow, spread around A flush of youth and joy, free nature's joy, Undimm'd by human change. How kindly here, With the low thyme and daisies, they have blent! And, under arches of wild eglantine, Drooping from this tall elm, how strangely seems The frail gum-cistus o'er the turf to snow Its pearly flower-leaves down!—Go, happy boy! Rove thou at will amidst these roving sweets, Whilst I, beside this fallen dial-stone, Under the tall moss rose-tree, long unpruned, Rest where thick clustering pansies weave around Their many-tinged mosaic, 'midst dark grass, Bedded like jewels. He hath bounded on, Wild with delight!—the crimson on his cheek Purer and richer e'en than that which lies In this deep-hearted rose-cup!—Bright moss rose! Though now so lorn, yet surely, gracious tree! Once thou wert cherish'd! and, by human love, Through many a summer duly visited For thy bloom-offerings, which o'er festal board, And youthful brow, and e'en the shaded couch Of long secluded sickness, may have shed A joy, now lost. Yet shall there still be joy, Where God hath pour'd forth beauty, and the voice Of human love shall still be heard in praise Over his glorious gifts!—O Father, Lord! The all-beneficent! I bless thy name, That thou hast mantled the green earth with flowers, Linking our hearts to nature! By the love Of their wild blossoms, our young footsteps first Into her deep recesses are beguiled, Her minster cells; dark glen and forest bower, Where, thrilling with its earliest sense of thee, Amidst the low religious whisperings And shivery leaf-sounds of the solitude, The spirit wakes to worship, and is made Thy living temple. By the breath of flowers, Thou callest us, from city throngs and cares, Back to the woods, the birds, the mountain streams, That sing of Thee! back to free childhood's heart, Fresh with the dews of tenderness!—Thou bidd'st The lilies of the field with placid smile Reprove man's feverish strivings, and infuse Through his worn soul a more unworldly life, With their soft holy breath. Thou hast not left His purer nature, with its fine desires, Uncared for in this universe of thine! The glowing rose attests it, the beloved Of poet hearts, touch'd by their fervent dreams With spiritual light, and made a source Of heaven-ascending thoughts. E'en to faint age Thou lend'st the vernal bliss:—the old man's eye Falls on the kindling blossoms, and his soul Remembers youth and love, and hopefully Turns unto thee, who call'st earth's buried germs From dust to splendour; as the mortal seed Shall, at thy summons, from the grave spring up To put on glory to be girt with power, And fill'd with immortality. Receive Thanks, blessings, love, for these, thy lavish boons, And, most of all, their heavenward influences, O Thou that gavest us flowers! Return, my boy, With all thy chaplets and bright bands return! See, with how deep a crimson eve hath touch'd And glorified the ruin! glow-worm light Will twinkle on the dewdrops, e'er we reach Our home again. Come, with thy last sweet prayer At thy bless'd mother's knee, to-night shall thanks Unto our Father in his heaven arise, For all the gladness, all the beauty shed O'er one rich day of flowers. HYMN OF THE TRAVELLER'S HOUSEHOLD ON HIS RETURN, IN THE OLDEN TIME. Joy! the lost one is restored! Sunshine comes to hearth and board. From the far-off countries old Of the diamond and red gold: From the dusky archer bands, Roamers of the fiery sands! From the desert winds, whose breath Smites with sudden silent death; He hath reach'd his home again, Where we sing In thy praise a fervent strain, God our King! Mightiest! unto Thee he turn'd, When the noon-day fiercest burn'd; When the fountain springs were far, And the sounds of Arab war Swell'd upon the sultry blast, And the sandy columns past, Unto Thee he cried! and Thou, Merciful! didst hear his vow! Therefore unto Thee again Joy shall sing, Many a sweet and thankful strain, God our King! Thou wert with him on the main, And the snowy mountain chain, And the rivers, dark and wide, Which through Indian forests glide, Thou didst guard him from the wrath Of the lion in his path, And the arrows on the breeze, And the dropping poison-trees: Therefore from our household train Oft shall spring Unto thee a blessing strain, God our King! Thou to his lone watching wife Hast brought back the light of life! Thou hast spared his loving child Home to greet him from the wild. Though the suns of eastern skies On his cheek have set their dyes, Though long toils and sleepless cares On his brow have blanch'd the hairs, Yet the night of fear is flown, He is living, and our own!— Brethren! spread his festal board, Hang his mantle and his sword, With the armour, on the wall— While this long, long silent hall Joyfully doth hear again Voice and string Swell to Thee the exulting strain, God our King! A PRAYER OF AFFECTION. Blessings, O Father! shower, Father of Mercies! round his precious head! On his lone walks and on his thoughtful hour, And the pure visions of his midnight bed, Blessings be shed! Father! I pray Thee not For earthly treasure to that most beloved, Fame, fortune, power:—oh! be his spirit proved By these, or by their absence, at Thy will! But let Thy peace be wedded to his lot, Guarding his inner life from touch of ill, With its dove-pinion still! Let such a sense of Thee, Thy watching presence, thy sustaining love, His bosom guest inalienably be, That wheresoe'er he move, A heavenly light serene Upon his heart and mien May sit undimm'd! a gladness rest his own, Unspeakable, and to the world unknown! Such as from childhood's morning land of dreams, Remember'd faintly, gleams, Faintly remember'd, and too swiftly flown! So let him walk with Thee, Made by Thy spirit free; And when Thou call'st him from his mortal place, To his last hour be still that sweetness given, That joyful trust! and brightly let him part, With lamp clear burning, and unlingering heart, Mature to meet in heaven His Saviour's face! THE PAINTER'S LAST WORK. Suggested by the closing scene in the life of the painter Blake, which is beautifully related by Allan Cunningham. “Clasp me a little longer on the brink Of life, while I can feel thy dear caress; And when this heart hath ceased to beat, oh! think, And let it mitigate thy woe's excess, That thou hast been to me all tenderness, And friend to more than human friendship just— Oh! by that retrospect of happiness, And by the hope of an immortal trust, God shall assuage thy pangs when I am laid in dust!” Campbell. The Scene is an English Cottage. The lattice opens upon a Landscape at sunset. Eugene—Teresa. Teresa. The fever's hue hath left thy cheek, beloved! Thine eyes, that make the dayspring in my heart, Are clear and still once more!—Wilt thou look forth? Now, while the sunset with low streaming light— The light thou lovest—hath made the elm-wood stems All burning bronze, the river molten gold! Wilt thou be raised upon thy couch, to meet The rich air fill'd with wandering scents and sounds? Or shall I lay thy dear, dear head once more On this true bosom, lulling thee to rest With our own evening hymn? Eugene. Not now, dear love, My soul is wakeful—lingering to look forth, Not on the sun, but thee!—Doth the light sleep On the stream tenderly? and are the stems Of our own elm-trees, by its alchemy, So richly changed? and is the sweetbrier scent Floating around?—But I have said farewell, Farewell to earth, Teresa!—not to thee; Nor yet to our deep love, nor yet awhile Unto the spirit of mine art, which flows Back on my soul in mastery.—One last work! And I will shrine my wealth of glowing thoughts, Clinging affections, and undying hopes, All, all in that memorial! Teresa. O, what dream Is this, mine own Eugene?—Waste thou not thus Thy scarce returning strength; keep thy rich thoughts For happier days! they will not melt away Like passing music from the lute—dear friend! Dearest of friends! thou canst win back at will The glorious visions. Eugene. Yes! the unseen land Of glorious visions hath sent forth a voice To call me hence.—Oh! be thou not deceived! Bind to thy heart no earthly hope, Teresa! I must, must leave thee!—Yet be strong, my love, As thou hast still been gentle. Teresa. O Eugene! What will this dim world be to me, Eugene, When wanting thy bright soul, the life of all? My only sunshine!—How can I bear on? How can we part? We that have loved so well, With clasping spirits link'd so long by grief, By tears, by prayer? Eugene. E'en therefore we can part, With an immortal trust, that such high love Is not of things to perish. Let me leave One record still of its ethereal flame Brightening thro' death's cold shadow. Once again, Stand with thy meek hands folded on thy breast, And eyes half veil'd, in thine own soul absorb'd, As in thy watchings, e'er I sink to sleep; And I will give the bending flower-like grace Of that soft form, and the still sweetness throned On that pale brow, and in that quivering smile Of voiceless love, a life that shall outlast Their delicate earthly being. There! thy head Bow'd down with beauty, and with tenderness, And lowly thought—even thus—my own Teresa! Oh! the quick-glancing radiance and bright bloom That once around thee hung, have melted now Into more solemn light—but holier far, And dearer, and yet lovelier in mine eyes, Than all that summer flush! For by my couch, In patient and serene devotedness, Thou hast made those rich hues and sunny smiles Thine offering unto me. Oh! I may give Those pensive lips, that clear Madonna brow, And the sweet earnestness of that dark eye, Unto the canvass;—I may catch the flow Of all those drooping locks, and glorify With a soft halo what is imaged thus— But how much rests unbreathed! my faithful one! What thou hast been to me! This bitter world, This cold unanswering world, that hath no voice To greet the gentle spirit, that drives back All birds of Eden, which would sojourn here A little while—how have I turn'd away From its keen soulless air, and in thy heart Found ever the sweet fountain of response, To quench my thirst for home! The dear work grows Beneath my hand,—the last! Teresa, (falling on his neck in tears.) Eugene, Eugene Break not my heart with thine excess of love!— Oh! must I loose thee—thou that hast been still The tenderest—best— Eugene. Weep, weep not thus, beloved! Let my true heart o'er thine retain its power Of soothing to the last!—Mine own Teresa! Take strength from strong affection!—Let our souls, Ere this brief parting, mingle in one strain Of deep, full thanksgiving, for God's rich boon— Our perfect love!—Oh! blessed have we been In that high gift; Thousands o'er earth may pass With hearts unfreshen'd by the heavenly dew, Which hath kept ours from withering.—Kneel, true wife! And lay thy hands in mine. [She kneels beside the couch—he prays. Oh, thus receive Thy children's thanks, Creator! for the love Which thou hast granted, through all earthly woes, To spread heaven's peace around them; which hath bound Their spirits to each other and to thee, With links whereon unkindness ne'er hath breathed, Nor wandering thought. We thank thee, gracious God! For all its treasured memories! tender cares, Fond words, bright, bright sustaining looks, unchanged Through tears and joy. O Father! most of all We thank, we bless Thee, for the priceless trust, Through Thy redeeming Son vouchsafed, to those That love in Thee, of union, in Thy sight, And in Thy heavens, immortal! Hear our prayer! Take home our fond affections, purified To spirit radiance from all earthly stain; Exalted, solemnized, made fit to dwell, Father! where all things that are lovely meet. And all things that are pure—for evermore, With Thee and Thine! MOTHER'S LITANY BY THE SICKBED OF A CHILD. Saviour, that of woman born, Mother-sorrow didst not scorn, Thou, with whose last anguish strove One dear thought of earthly love— Hear and aid! Low he lies, my precious child, With his spirit wandering wild From its gladsome tasks and play, And its bright thoughts far away— Saviour, aid! Pain sits heavy on his brow, E'en though slumber seal it now; Round his lip is quivering strife, In his hand unquiet life— Aid! oh, aid! Saviour! loose the burning chain From his fever'd heart and brain, Give, oh! give his young soul back, Into its own cloudless track! Hear and aid! Thou that said'st, “Awake, arise!” E'en when death had quench'd the eyes, In this hour of grief's deep sighing, When o'erwearied hope is dying! Hear and aid! Yet, oh! make him thine, all thine, Saviour! whether death's or mine! Yet, oh! pour on human love, Strength, trust, patience, from above! Hear and aid! NIGHT HYMN AT SEA. THE WORDS WRITTEN FOR A MELODY BY FELTON. Night sinks on the wave, Hollow gusts are sighing, Sea-birds to their cave Through the gloom are flying. Oh! should storms come sweeping, Thou, in heaven unsleeping, O'er thy children vigil keeping, Hear, hear, and save! Stars look o'er the sea, Few, and sad, and shrouded; Faith our light must be, When all else is clouded. Thou, whose voice came thrilling, Wind and billow stilling, Speak once more! our prayer fulfilling— Power dwells with Thee! FEMALE CHARACTERS OF SCRIPTURE. A SERIES OF SONNETS. Suggested by the perusal of Mrs Sandford's Woman. “Your tents are desolate; your stately steps, Of all their choral dances, have not left One trace beside the fountains: your full cup Of gladness and of trembling, each alike Is broken; yet, amidst undying things, The mind still keeps your loveliness, and still All the fresh glories of the early world Hang round you in the spirit's pictured halls, Never to change!” I.—INVOCATION. As the tired voyager on stormy seas Invokes the coming of bright birds from shore, To waft him tidings, with the gentler breeze, Of dim sweet woods that hear no billows roar; So, from the depth of days, when earth yet wore Her solemn beauty and primeval dew, I call you, gracious Forms! Oh! come, restore Awhile that holy freshness, and renew Life's morning dreams. Come with the voice, the lyre, Daughters of Judah! with the timbrel rise! Ye of the dark prophetic eastern eyes, Imperial in their visionary fire; Oh! steep my soul in that old glorious time, When God's own whisper shook the cedars of your clime! II.—INVOCATION CONTINUED. And come, ye faithful! round Messiah seen, With a soft harmony of tears and light Streaming through all your spiritual mien, As in calm clouds of pearly stillness bright, Showers weave with sunshine, and transpierce their slight Ethereal cradle.—From your heart subdued All haughty dreams of power had wing'd their flight, And left high place for martyr fortitude, True faith, long-suffering love.—Come to me, come! And, as the seas beneath your master's tread Fell into crystal smoothness, round him spread Like the clear pavement of his heavenly home; So in your presence, let the soul's great deep Sink to the gentleness of infant sleep. III.—THE SONG OF MIRIAM. A song for Israel's God!—Spear, crest, and helm, Lay by the billows of the old Red Sea, When Miriam's voice o'er that sepulchral realm Sent on the blast a hymn of jubilee; With her lit eye, and long hair floating free, Queen-like she stood, and glorious was the strain, E'en as instinct with the tempestuous glee Of the dark waters, tossing o'er the slain. A song for God's own victory!—O, thy lays, Bright poesy! were holy in their birth:— How hath it died, thy seraph note of praise, In the bewildering melodies of earth! Return from troubling bitter founts—return, Back to the life-springs of thy native urn! IV.—RUTH. The plume-like swaying of the auburn corn, By soft winds to a dreamy motion fann'd, Still brings me back thine image—Oh! forlorn, Yet not forsaken, Ruth!—I see thee stand Lone, 'midst the gladness of the harvest band— Lone, as a wood-bird on the ocean's foam, Fall'n in its weariness. Thy fatherland Smiles far away! yet to the sense of home, That finest, purest, which can recognise Home in affection's glance, for ever true Beats thy calm heart; and if thy gentle eyes Gleam tremulous through tears, 'tis not to rue Those words, immortal in their deep love's tone, “Thy people and thy God shall be mine own!” V.—THE VIGIL OF RIZPAH. “And Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven; and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.” 2 Sam. xxi. 10. Who watches on the mountain with the dead, Alone before the awfulness of night?— A seer awaiting the deep spirit's might? A warrior guarding some dark pass of dread No, a lorn woman!—On her drooping head, Once proudly graceful, heavy beats the rain; She recks not—living for the unburied slain, Only to scare the vulture from their bed. So, night by night, her vigil hath she kept With the pale stars, and with the dews hath wept;— Oh! surely some bright Presence from above On those wild rocks the lonely one must aid!— E'en so; a strengthener through all storm and shade, Th' unconquerable angel, mightiest love! VI.—THE REPLY OF THE SHUNAMITE WOMAN. “And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.” 2 Kings iv. 13. “I dwell among mine own,”—Oh! happy thou! Not for the sunny clusters of the vine, Not for the olives on the mountain's brow; Nor the flocks wandering by the flowery line Of streams, that make the green land where they shine Laugh to the light of waters—not for these, Nor the soft shadow of ancestral trees, Whose kindly whisper floats o'er thee and thine— Oh! not for these I call thee richly blest, But for the meekness of thy woman's breast, Where that sweet depth of still contentment lies; And for thy holy household love, which clings Unto all ancient and familiar things, Weaving from each some link for home's dear charities. VII.—THE ANNUNCIATION. Lowliest of women, and most glorified! In thy still beauty sitting calm and lone, A brightness round thee grew—and by thy side Kindling the air, a form ethereal shone, Solemn, yet breathing gladness. From her throne A queen had risen with more imperial eye, A stately prophetess of victory From her proud lyre had struck a tempest's tone, For such high tidings as to thee were brought, Chosen of Heaven! that hour:—but thou, O thou! E'en as a flower with gracious rains o'erfraught, Thy virgin head beneath its crown didst bow, And take to thy meek breast th' all holy word, And own thyself the handmaid of the Lord. VIII.—THE SONG OF THE VIRGIN. Yet as a sunburst flushing mountain snow, Fell the celestial touch of fire erelong On the pale stillness of thy thoughtful brow, And thy calm spirit lighten'd into song. Unconsciously, perchance, yet free and strong Flow'd the majestic joy of tuneful words, Which living harps the quires of Heaven among Might well have link'd with their divinest chords. Full many a strain, borne far on glory's blast, Shall leave, where once its haughty music pass'd, No more to memory than a reed's faint sigh; While thine, O childlike virgin! through all time Shall send its fervent breath o'er every clime, Being of God, and therefore not to die. IX.—THE PENITENT ANOINTING CHRIST'S FEET. There was a mournfulness in angel eyes, That saw thee, woman! bright in this world's train, Moving to pleasure's airy melodies, Thyself the idol of the enchanted strain. But from thy beauty's garland, brief and vain, When one by one the rose-leaves had been torn, When thy heart's core had quiver'd to the pain Through every life-nerve sent by arrowy scorn; When thou didst kneel to pour sweet odours forth On the Redeemer's feet, with many a sigh, And showering tear-drop, of yet richer worth Than all those costly balms of Araby; Then was there joy, a song of joy in heaven, For thee, the child won back, the penitent forgiven! X.—MARY AT THE FEET OF CHRIST. Oh! bless'd beyond all daughters of the earth! What were the Orient's thrones to that low seat Where thy hush'd spirit drew celestial birth? Mary! meek listener at the Saviour's feet! No feverish cares to that divine retreat Thy woman's heart of silent worship brought, But a fresh childhood, heavenly truth to meet, With love, and wonder, and submissive thought. Oh! for the holy quiet of thy breast, 'Midst the world's eager tones and footsteps flying Thou, whose calm soul was like a well-spring, lying So deep and still in its transparent rest, That e'en when noontide burns upon the hills, Some one bright solemn star all its lone mirror fills. XI.—THE SISTERS OF BETHANY AFTER THE DEATH OF LAZARUS. One grief, one faith, O sisters of the dead! Was in your bosoms—thou, whose steps, made fleet By keen hope fluttering in the heart which bled, Bore thee, as wings, the Lord of Life to greet; And thou, that duteous in thy still retreat Didst wait his summons—then with reverent love Fall weeping at the bless'd Deliverer's feet, Whom e'en to heavenly tears thy woe could move. And which to Him, the All Seeing and All Just, Was loveliest, that quick zeal, or lowly trust? Oh! question not, and let no law be given To those unveilings of its deepest shrine, By the wrung spirit made in outward sign: Free service from the heart is all in all to Heaven. XII.—THE MEMORIAL OF MARY. “Verily I say unto you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.”—Matthew, xxvi. 13.—See also John, xii. 3. Thou hast thy record in the monarch's hall; And on the waters of the far mid sea; And where the mighty mountain-shadows fall, The alpine hamlet keeps a thought of thee: Where'er, beneath some oriental tree, The Christian traveller rests—where'er the child Looks upward from the English mother's knee, With earnest eyes in wondering reverence mild, There art thou known—where'er the Book of light Bears hope and healing, there, beyond all blight, Is borne thy memory, and all praise above: Oh! say what deed so lifted thy sweet name, Mary! to that pure silent place of fame? One lowly offering of exceeding love. XIII.—THE WOMEN OF JERUSALEM AT THE CROSS. Like those pale stars of tempest hours, whose gleam Waves calm and constant on the rocking mast, Such by the cross doth your bright lingering seem, Daughters of Zion! faithful to the last! Ye, through the darkness o'er the wide earth cast By the death-cloud within the Saviour's eye, E'en till away the heavenly spirit pass'd, Stood in the shadow of his agony. O blessed faith! a guiding lamp, that hour Was lit for woman's heart; to her, whose dower Is all of love and suffering from her birth; Still hath your act a voice—through fear, through strife, Bidding her bind each tendril of her life, To that which her deep soul hath proved of holiest worth. XIV.—MARY MAGDALENE AT THE SEPULCHRE. Weeper! to thee how bright a morn was given After thy long, long vigil of despair, When that high voice which burial rocks had riven, Thrill'd with immortal tones the silent air! Never did clarion's royal blast declare Such tale of victory to a breathless crowd, As the deep sweetness of one word could bear Into thy heart of hearts, O woman! bow'd By strong affection's anguish! one low word— “Mary!”—and all the triumph wrung from death Was thus reveal'd! and thou, that so hadst err'd, So wept, and been forgiven, in trembling faith Didst cast thee down before the all-conquering Son, Awed by the mighty gift thy tears and love had won! XV.—MARY MAGDALENE BEARING TIDINGS OF THE RESURRECTION. Then was a task of glory all thine own, Nobler than e'er the still small voice assign'd To lips, in awful music making known The stormy splendours of some prophet's mind. “Christ is arisen!”—by thee, to wake mankind, First from the sepulchre those words were brought! Thou wert to send the mighty rushing wind First on its way, with those high tidings fraught— “Christ is arisen!”—Thou, thou, the sin enthrall'd, Earth's outcast, Heaven's own ransom'd one, wert call'd In human hearts to give that rapture birth: Oh! raised from shame to brightness!—there doth lie The tenderest meaning of His ministry, Whose undespairing love still own'd the spirit's worth. THE TWO MONUMENTS. Suggested by a passage in Captain Sherer's “Notes and Reflections during a Ramble in Germany.” “Oh! bless'd are they who live and die like ‘him,’ Loved with such love, and with such sorrow mourn'd!” Wordsworth. Banners hung drooping from on high In a dim cathedral's nave, Making a gorgeous canopy O'er a noble, noble grave! And a marble warrior's form beneath, With helm and crest array'd, As on his battle-bed of death, Lay in their crimson shade. Triumph yet linger'd in his eye, Ere by the dark night seal'd, And his head was pillow'd haughtily On standard and on shield. And shadowing that proud trophy pile With the glory of his wing, An eagle sat;—yet seem'd the while Panting through heaven to spring. He sat upon a shiver'd lance, There by the sculptor bound; But in the light of his lifted glance Was that which scorn'd the ground. And a burning flood of gem-like hues From a storied window pour'd, There fell, there centred, to suffuse The conqueror and his sword. A flood of hues; but one rich dye O'er all supremely spread, With a purple robe of royalty Mantling the mighty dead. Meet was that robe for him whose name Was a trumpet note in war, His pathway still the march of fame, His eye the battle star. But faintly, tenderly was thrown, From the colour'd light, one ray, Where a low and pale memorial stone By the couch of glory lay. Few were the fond words chisell'd there, Mourning for parted worth; But the very heart of love and prayer Had given their sweetness forth. They spoke of one whose life had been As a hidden streamlet's course, Bearing on health and joy unseen, From its clear mountain-source: Whose young pure memory, lying deep 'Midst rock, and wood, and hill, Dwelt in the homes where poor men sleep, Love had he seen in huts where poor men lie. Wordsworth. A soft light meek and still: Whose gentle voice, too early call'd Unto Music's land away, Had won for God the earth's enthrall'd, By words of silvery sway. These were his victories—yet enroll'd In no high song of fame, The pastor of the mountain-fold Left but to heaven his name. To heaven and to the peasant's hearth, A blessed household sound— And finding lowly love on earth, Enough, enough, he found! Bright and more bright before me gleam'd That sainted image still; Till one sweet moonlight memory seem'd The regal fane to fill. Oh! how my silent spirit turn'd From those proud trophies nigh! How my full heart within me burn'd Like Him to live and die! THE COTTAGE GIRL. A child beside a hamlet's fount at play, Her fair face laughing at the sunny day; A gush of waters tremulously bright, Kindling the air to gladness with their light; And a soft gloom beyond, of summer trees, Darkening the turf, and shadow'd o'er by these, A low, dim, woodland cottage—this was all! What had the scene for memory to recall With a fond look of love! What secret spell With the heart's pictures made its image dwell? What but the spirit of the joyous child, That freshly forth o'er stream and verdure smiled, Casting upon the common things of earth A brightness, born and gone with infant mirth! THE BATTLE-FIELD. I look'd on the field where the battle was spread, When thousands stood forth in their glancing array; And the beam from the steel of the valiant was shed Through the dun-rolling clouds that o'ershadow'd the fray. I saw the dark forest of lances appear, As the ears of the harvest unnumber'd they stood, I heard the stern shout as the foemen drew near, Like the storm that lays low the proud pines of the wood. Afar, the harsh notes of the war-drum were roll'd, Uprousing the wolf from the depth of his lair; On high to the gust stream'd the banner's red fold, O'er the death-close of hate, and the scowl of despair. I look'd on the field of contention again, When the sabre was sheath'd and the tempest had past; The wild weed and thistle grew rank on the plain, And the fern softly sigh'd in the low wailing blast. Unmoved lay the lake in its hour of repose, And bright shone the stars through the sky's deepen'd blue; And sweetly the song of the night-bird arose, Where the fox-glove lay gemm'd with its pearldrops of dew. But where swept the ranks of that dark frowning host, As the ocean in might—as the storm-cloud in speed! Where now were the thunders of victory's boast— The slayer's dread wrath, and the strength of the steed? Not a time-wasted cross, not a mouldering stone, To mark the lone scene of their shame or their pride; One grass-cover'd mound told the traveller alone, Where thousands lay down in their anguish, and died! Oh, glory! behold thy famed guerdon's extent: For this, toil thy slaves through their earth-wasting lot; A name like the mist, when the night-beams are spent— A grave with its tenants unwept and forgot! A PENITENT'S RETURN. “Can guilt or misery ever enter here? Ah! no, the spirit of domestic peace, Though calm and gentle as the brooding dove, And ever murmuring forth a quiet song, Guards, powerful as the sword of cherubim, The hallow'd porch. She hath a heavenly smile, That sinks into the sullen soul of vice, And wins him o'er to virtue.” Wilson. My father's house once more, In its own moonlight beauty! Yet around, Something, amidst the dewy calm profound, Broods, never mark'd before! Is it the brooding night, Is it the shivery creeping on the air, That makes the home, so tranquil and so fair, O'erwhelming to my sight? All solemnized it seems, And still'd, and darken'd in each time-worn hue, Since the rich clustering roses met my view, As now, by starry gleams. And this high elm, where last I stood and linger'd—where my sisters made Our mother's bower—I deem'd not that it cast So far and dark a shade! How spirit-like a tone Sighs through yon tree! My father's place was there At evening hours, while soft winds waved his hair! Now those grey locks are gone! My soul grows faint with fear! Even as if angel steps had mark'd the sod. I tremble where I move—the voice of God Is in the foliage here! Is it indeed the night That makes my home so awful? Faithless hearted! 'Tis that from thine own bosom hath departed The inborn gladd'ning light! No outward thing is changed; Only the joy of purity is fled, And, long from nature's melodies estranged, Thou hear'st their tones with dread. Therefore the calm abode, By thy dark spirit, is o'erhung with shade; And therefore, in the leaves, the voice of God Makes thy sick heart afraid! The night-flowers round that door Still breathe pure fragrance on the untainted air; Thou, thou alone art worthy now no more To pass, and rest thee there. And must I turn away?— Hark, hark!—it is my mother's voice I hear— Sadder than once it seem'd—yet soft and clear— Doth she not seem to pray? My name!—I caught the sound! Oh! blessed tone of love—the deep, the mild— Mother, my mother! Now receive thy child, Take back the lost and found! A THOUGHT OF PARADISE. “We receive but what we give, And in our life alone does nature live; Ours is her wedding-garment, ours her shroud; And, would we aught behold of higher worth Than that inanimate cold world allow'd To the poor, loveless, ever-anxious crowd, Ah! from the soul itself must issue forth A light, a glory, a fair luminous cloud, Enveloping the earth; And from the soul itself must there be sent A sweet and potent voice of its own birth, Of all sweet sounds the life and element.” Coleridge. Green spot of holy ground! If thou couldst yet be found, Far in deep woods, with all thy starry flowers; If not one sullying breath Of time, or change, or death, Had touch'd the vernal glory of thy bowers; Might our tired pilgrim-feet, Worn by the desert's heat, On the bright freshness of thy turf repose? Might our eyes wander there Through heaven's transparent air, And rest on colours of the immortal rose? Say, would thy balmy skies And fountain-melodies Our heritage of lost delight restore? Could thy soft honey-dews Through all our veins diffuse The early, child-like, trustful sleep once more? And might we, in the shade By thy tall cedars made, With angel voices high communion hold? Would their sweet solemn tone Give back the music gone, Our Being's harmony, so jarr'd of old? Oh! no—thy sunny hours Might come with blossom showers, All thy young leaves to spirit lyres might thrill; But we—should we not bring Into thy realms of spring The shadows of our souls to haunt us still? What could thy flowers and airs Do for our earth-born cares? Would the world's chain melt off and leave us free? No!—past each living stream, Still would some fever dream Track the lorn wand'rers, meet no more for thee! Should we not shrink with fear, If angel steps were near, Feeling our burden'd souls within us die? How might our passions brook The still and searching look, The starlike glance of seraph purity? Thy golden-fruited grove Was not for pining love; Vain sadness would but dim thy crystal skies! Oh! Thou wert but a part Of what man's exiled heart Hath lost—the dower of inborn Paradise! LET US DEPART. Night hung on Salem's towers, And a brooding hush profound Lay where the Roman eagle shone, High o'er the tents around, The tents that rose by thousands, In the moonlight glimmering pale; Like white waves of a frozen sea, Filling an Alpine vale. And the temple's massy shadow Fell broad, and dark, and still, In peace, as if the Holy One Yet watch'd his chosen hill. But a fearful sound was heard In that old fane's deepest heart, As if mighty wings rush'd by, And a dread voice raised the cry, “Let us depart!” Within the fated city E'en then fierce discord raved, Though o'er night's heaven the comet sword Its vengeful token waved. There were shouts of kindred warfare Through the dark streets ringing high, Though every sign was full which told Of the bloody vintage nigh. Though the wild red spears and arrows Of many a meteor host, Went flashing o'er the holy stars, In the sky now seen, now lost. And that fearful sound was heard In the Temple's deepest heart, As if mighty wings rush'd by, And a voice cried mournfully, “Let us depart!” But within the fated city There was revelry that night; The wine-cup and the timbrel note, And the blaze of banquet light. The footsteps of the dancer Went bounding through the hall, And the music of the dulcimer Summon'd to festival. While the clash of brother weapons Made lightning in the air, And the dying at the palace gates Lay down in their despair. And that fearful sound was heard At the Temple's thrilling heart, As if mighty wings rush'd by, And a dread voice raised the cry, “Let us depart!” ON A PICTURE OF CHRIST BEARING THE CROSS, PAINTED BY VELASQUEZ. This picture is in the possession of the Viscount Harberton, Merrion Square, Dublin. By the dark stillness brooding in the sky, Holiest of sufferers! round thy path of woe, And by the weight of mortal agony Laid on thy drooping form and pale meek brow, My heart was awed: the burden of thy pain Sank on me with a mystery and a chain. I look'd once more, and, as the virtue shed Forth from thy robe of old, so fell a ray Of victory from thy mien! and round thy head, The halo, melting spirit-like away, Seem'd of the very soul's bright rising born, To glorify all sorrow, shame, and scorn. And upwards, through transparent darkness gleaming, Gazed in mute reverence, woman's earnest eye, Lit, as a vase whence inward light is streaming, With quenchless faith, and deep love's fervency; Gathering, like incense, round some dim-veil'd shrine, About the form, so mournfully divine! Oh! let thine image, as e'en then it rose, Live in my soul for ever, calm and clear, Making itself a temple of repose, Beyond the breath of human hope or fear! A holy place, where through all storms may lie One living beam of dayspring from on high. COMMUNINGS WITH THOUGHT. “Could we but keep our spirits to that height, We might be happy; but this clay will sink Its spark immortal.” Byron. Return my thoughts, come home! Ye wild and wing'd! what do ye o'er the deep? And wherefore thus the abyss of time o'ersweep, As birds the ocean foam? Swifter than shooting star, Swifter than lances of the northern light, Upspringing through the purple heaven of night, Hath been your course afar! Through the bright battle-clime, Where laurel boughs make dim the Grecian streams, And reeds are whispering of heroic themes, By temples of old time: Through the north's ancient halls, Where banners thrill'd of yore—where harp-strings rung; But grass waves now o'er those that fought and sung— Hearth-light hath left their walls! Through forests old and dim, Where o'er the leaves dread magic seems to brood; And sometimes on the haunted solitude Rises the pilgrim's hymn: Or where some fountain lies, With lotus-cups through orient spice-woods gleaming! There have ye been, ye wanderers! idly dreaming Of man's lost paradise! Return, my thoughts, return! Cares wait your presence in life's daily track, And voices, not of music, call you back— Harsh voices, cold and stern! Oh! no, return ye not! Still farther, loftier, let your soarings be! Go, bring me strength from journeyings bright and free, O'er many a haunted spot. Go, seek the martyr's grave, 'Midst the old mountains, and the deserts vast; Or, through the ruin'd cities of the past, Follow the wise and brave! Go, visit cell and shrine! Where woman hath endured!—through wrong, through scorn, Uncheer'd by fame, yet silently upborne By promptings more divine! Go, shoot the gulf of death! Track the pure spirit where no chain can bind, Where the heart's boundless love its rest may find, Where the storm sends no breath! Higher, and yet more high! Shake off the cumbering chain which earth would lay On your victorious wings—mount, mount!—Your way Is through eternity! SONNETS, DEVOTIONAL AND MEMORIAL. I.—THE SACRED HARP. How shall the harp of poesy regain That old victorious tone of prophet-years, A spell divine o'er guilt's perturbing fears, And all the hovering shadows of the brain? Dark evil wings took flight before the strain, And showers of holy quiet, with its fall, Sank on the soul. Oh! who may now recall The mighty music's consecrated reign? Spirit of God! whose glory once o'erhung A throne, the ark's dread cherubim between, So let thy presence brood, though now unseen, O'er those two powers by whom the harp is strung, Feeling and Thought! till the rekindled chords Give the long-buried tone back to immortal words. II.—TO A FAMILY BIBLE. What household thoughts around thee, as their shrine, Cling reverently?—of anxious looks beguiled My mother's eyes, upon thy page divine, Each day were bent—her accents, gravely mild, Breathed out thy lore: whilst I, a dreamy child, Wandered on breeze-like fancies oft away, To some lone tuft of gleaming spring-flowers wild, Some fresh discover'd nook for woodland play, Some secret nest: yet would the solemn Word, At times, with kindlings of young wonder heard, Fall on my wakened spirit, there to be A seed not lost;—for which, in darker years, O Book of Heaven! I pour, with grateful tears, Heart blessings on the holy dead and thee! III.—REPOSE OF A HOLY FAMILY. FROM AN OLD ITALIAN PICTURE. Under a palm-tree, by the green old Nile, Lull'd on his mother's breast, the fair child lies, With dove-like breathings, and a tender smile, Brooding above the slumber of his eyes. While, through the stillness of the burning skies, Lo! the dread works of Egypt's buried kings, Temple and pyramid, beyond him rise, Regal and still as everlasting things!— Vain pomps! from him, with that pure flowery cheek, Soft shadow'd by his mother's drooping head, A new-born spirit, mighty, and yet meek, O'er the whole world like vernal air shall spread! And bid all earthly grandeurs cast the crown, Before the suffering and the lowly, down. IV.—PICTURE OF THE INFANT CHRIST WITH FLOWERS. All the bright hues from eastern garlands glowing; Round the young child luxuriantly are spread; Gifts, fairer far than Magian kings, bestowing In adoration, o'er his cradle shed. Roses, deep-filled with rich midsummer's red, Circle his hands; but, in his grave sweet eye, Thought seems e'en now to wake, and prophecy Of ruder coronals for that meek head. And thus it was! a diadem of thorn Earth gave to Him who mantled her with flowers, To Him who pour'd forth blessings in soft showers O'er all her paths, a cup of bitter scorn! And we repine, for whom that cup He took, O'er blooms that mock'd our hope, o'er idols that forsook! V.—ON A REMEMBERED PICTURE OF CHRIST. AN ECCE HOMO, BY LEONARDO DA VINCI. I met that image on a mirthful day Of youth; and, sinking with a still'd surprise, The pride of life, before those holy eyes, In my quick heart died thoughtfully away, Abash'd to mute confession of a sway, Awful, though meek; and now, that from the strings Of my soul's lyre, the tempest's mighty wings Have struck forth tones which then awaken'd lay; Now, that around the deep life of my mind, Affections, deathless as itself, have twined, Oft does the pale bright vision still float by; But more divinely sweet, and speaking now Of One whose pity, throned on that sad brow, Sounded all depths of love, grief, death, humanity! VI.—THE CHILDREN WHOM JESUS BLESSED. Happy were they, the mothers, in whose sight Ye grew, fair children! hallow'd from that hour By your Lord's blessing! surely thence a shower Of heavenly beauty, a transmitted light Hung on your brows and eyelids, meekly bright, Through all the after years, which saw ye move Lowly, yet still majestic, in the might, The conscious glory of the Saviour's love! And honour'd be all childhood, for the sake Of that high love! Let reverential care Watch to behold the immortal spirit wake, And shield its first bloom from unholy air; Owning, in each young suppliant glance, the sign Of claims upon a heritage divine. VII.—MOUNTAIN SANCTUARIES. “He went up to a mountain apart to pray.” A child 'midst ancient mountains I have stood, Where the wild falcons make their lordly nest On high. The spirit of the solitude Fell solemnly upon my infant breast, Though then I pray'd not; but deep thoughts have press'd Into my being since it breathed that air, Nor could I now one moment live the guest Of such dread scenes, without the springs of prayer O'erflowing all my soul. No minsters rise Like them in pure communion with the skies, Vast, silent, open unto night and day; So might the o'erburden'd Son of Man have felt, When, turning where inviolate stillness dwelt, He sought high mountains, there apart to pray. VIII.—THE LILIES OF THE FIELD. “Consider the lilies of the field.” Flowers! when the Saviour's calm benignant eye Fell on your gentle beauty—when from you That heavenly lesson for all hearts he drew, Eternal, universal, as the sky— Then, in the bosom of your purity, A voice He set, as in a temple-shrine, That life's quick travellers ne'er might pass you by, Unwarn'd of that sweet oracle divine. And though too oft its low, celestial sound, By the harsh notes of work-day Care is drown'd, And the loud steps of vain unlistening Haste, Yet, the great ocean hath no tone of power Mightier to reach the soul, in thought's hush'd hour, Than yours, ye Lilies! chosen thus and graced! IX.—THE BIRDS OF THE AIR. “And behold the birds of the air.” Ye too, the free and fearless Birds of air, Were charged that hour, on missionary wing, The same bright lesson o'er the seas to bear, Heaven-guided wanderers, with the winds of spring Sing on, before the storm and after, sing! And call us to your echoing woods away From worldly cares; and bid our spirits bring Faith to imbibe deep wisdom from your lay. So may those blessed vernal strains renew Childhood, a childhood yet more pure and true E'en than the first, within th' awaken'd mind; While sweetly, joyously, they tell of life, That knows no doubts, no questionings, no strife, But hangs upon its God, unconsciously resign'd. X.—THE RAISING OF THE WIDOW'S SON. “And he that was dead sat up and began to speak.” He that was dead rose up and spoke—He spoke! Was it of that majestic world unknown? Those words, which first the bier's dread silence broke, Came they with revelation in each tone? Were the far cities of the nations gone, The solemn halls of consciousness or sleep, For man uncurtain'd by that spirit lone, Back from their portal summon'd o'er the deep? Be hush'd, my soul! the veil of darkness lay Still drawn: thy Lord call'd back the voice departed, To spread his truth, to comfort his weak-hearted, Not to reveal the mysteries of its way. Oh! take that lesson home in silent faith, Put on submissive strength to meet, not question, death! XI.—THE OLIVE-TREE. The Palm—the Vine—the Cedar—each hath power To bid fair Oriental shapes glance by, And each quick glistening of the Laurel bower Wafts Grecian images o'er fancy's eye. But thou, pale Olive!—in thy branches lie Far deeper spells than prophet grove of old Might e'er enshrine:—I could not hear the sigh To the wind's faintest whisper, nor behold One shiver of thy leaves' dim silvery green, Without high thoughts and solemn, of that scene When, in the garden, the Redeemer pray'd— When pale stars look'd upon his fainting head, And angels, minist'ring in silent dread, Trembled, perchance, within thy trembling shade. XII.—THE DARKNESS OF THE CRUCIFIXION. On Judah's hills a weight of darkness hung, Felt shudderingly at noon:—the land had driven A Guest divine back to the gates of heaven, A life, whence all pure founts of healing sprung, All grace, all truth:—and, when to anguish wrung, From the sharp cross th' enlightening spirit fled, O'er the forsaken earth a pall of dread By the great shadow of that death was flung. O Saviour! O Atoner! thou that fain Wouldst make thy temple in each human breast, Leave not such darkness in my soul to reign, Ne'er may thy presence from its depths depart, Chased thence by guilt! Oh! turn not thou away, The bright and morning star, my guide to perfect day! XIII.—PLACES OF WORSHIP. “God is a spirit.” Spirit! whose life-sustaining presence fills Air, ocean, central depths by man untried, Thou for thy worshippers hast sanctified All place, all time! The silence of the hills Breathes veneration:—founts and choral rills Of thee are murmuring:—to its inmost glade The living forest with thy whisper thrills, And there is holiness on every shade. Yet must the thoughtful soul of man invest With dearer consecration those pure fanes, Which, sever'd from all sound of earth's unrest, Hear nought but suppliant or adoring strains Rise heavenward.—Ne'er may rock or cave possess Their claim on human hearts to solemn tenderness. XIV.—OLD CHURCH IN AN ENGLISH PARK. Fawsley Park, near Daventry. Crowning a flowery slope it stood alone In gracious sanctity. A bright rill wound, Caressingly, about the holy ground; And warbled, with a never-dying tone, Amidst the tombs. A hue of ages gone Seem'd, from that ivied porch, that solemn gleam Of tower and cross, pale quivering on the stream, O'er all th' ancestral woodlands to be thrown, And something yet more deep. The air was fraught With noble memories, whispering many a thought Of England's fathers; loftily serene, They that had toil'd, watch'd, struggled, to secure, Within such fabrics, worship free and pure, Reign'd there, the o'ershadowing spirits of the scene. XV.—A CHURCH IN NORTH WALES. That of Aber, near Bangor. Blessings be round it still! that gleaming fane, Low in its mountain-glen! old mossy trees Mellow the sunshine through the untinted pane, And oft, borne in upon some fitful breeze, The deep sound of the ever-pealing seas, Filling the hollows with its anthem-tone, There meets the voice of psalms!—yet not alone, For memories lulling to the heart as these, I bless thee, 'midst thy rocks, grey house of prayer! But for their sakes who unto thee repair From the hill-cabins and the ocean-shore. Oh! may the fisher and the mountaineer, Words to sustain earth's toiling children hear, Within thy lowly walls for evermore! XVI.—LOUISE SCHEPLER. A fearless journeyer o'er the mountain snow Wert thou, Louise! the sun's decaying light, Oft, with its latest melancholy glow, Redden'd thy steep wild way: the starry night Oft met thee, crossing some lone eagle's height. Piercing some dark ravine: and many a dell Knew, through its ancient rock-recesses well, Thy gentle presence, which hath made them bright Oft in mid-storms; oh! not with beauty's eye, Nor the proud glance of genius keenly burning; No! pilgrim of unwearying charity! Thy spell was love—the mountain deserts turning To blessed realms, where stream and rock rejoice When the glad human soul lifts a thanksgiving voice! XVII.—TO THE SAME. For thou, a holy shepherdess and kind, Through the pine forests, by the upland rills, Didst roam to seek the children of the hills, A wild neglected flock! to seek, and find, And meekly win! there feeding each young mind With blams of heavenly eloquence: not thine, Daughter of Christ! but his, whose love divine Its own clear spirit in thy breast had shrined, A burning light! Oh! beautiful, in truth, Upon the mountains are the feet of those Who bear his tidings! From thy morn of youth, For this were all thy journeyings, and the close Of that long path, Heaven's own bright sabbathrest, Must wait thee, wanderer! on thy Saviour's breast. THE WATER-LILY. “The Water-Lilies, that are serene in the calm clear water, but no less serene among the black and scowling waves.” Lights and Shadows of Scottish Life. Oh! beautiful thou art, Thou sculpture-like and stately river-queen! Crowning the depths, as with the light serene Of a pure heart. Bright lily of the wave! Rising in fearless grace with every swell, Thou seem'st as if a spirit meekly brave Dwelt in thy cell: Lifting alike thy head Of placid beauty, feminine yet free, Whether with foam or pictured azure spread The waters be. What is like thee, fair flower, The gentle and the firm? thus bearing up To the blue sky that alabaster cup, As to the shower? Oh! love is most like thee, The love of woman! quivering to the blast Through every nerve, yet rooted deep and fast 'Midst life's dark sea. And faith—O, is not faith Like thee, too, lily, springing into light, Still buoyantly, above the billows' might, Through the storm's breath? Yes, link'd with such high thought Flower, let thine image in my bosom lie! Till something there of its own purity And peace be wrought: Something yet more divine Than the clear, pearly, virgin lustre shed Forth from thy breast upon the river's bed. As from a shrine. RECORDS OF THE SPRING OF 1834. I.—A VERNAL THOUGHT. O festal Spring! 'midst thy victorious glow, Far-spreading o'er the kindled woods and plains, And streams, that bound to meet thee from their chains, Well might there lurk the shadow of a woe For human hearts, and in the exulting flow Of thy rich songs a melancholy tone, Were we of mould all earthly; we alone, Sever'd from thy great spell, and doom'd to go Farther, still farther, from our sunny time, Never to feel the breathings of our prime, Never to flower again!—But we, O Spring! Cheer'd by deep spirit-whispers not of earth, Press to the regions of thy heavenly birth, As here thy flowers and birds press on to bloom and sing. II.—TO THE SKY. Far from the rustlings of the poplar bough, Which o'er my opening life wild music made, Far from the green hills with their heathery glow And flashing streams whereby my childhood play'd; In the dim city, 'midst the sounding flow Of restless life, to thee in love I turn O thou rich sky! and from thy splendours learn How song-birds come and part, flowers wane and blow. With thee all shapes of glory find their home, And thou hast taught me well, majestic dome! By stars, by sunsets, by soft clouds which rove Thy blue expanse, or sleep in silvery rest, That Nature's God hath left no spot unbless'd With founts of beauty for the eye of love. III.—ON RECORDS OF IMMATURE GENIUS. Written after reading Memorials of the late Mrs Tighe. Oh! judge in thoughtful tenderness of those, Who, richly dower'd for life, are called to die, Ere the soul's flame, through storms, hath won repose In truth's divinest ether, still and high! Let their mind's riches claim a trustful sigh! Deem them but sad sweet fragments of a strain, First notes of some yet struggling harmony, By the strong rush, the crowding joy and pain Of many inspirations met, and held From its true sphere:—Oh! soon it might have swell'd Majestically forth!—Nor doubt, that He, Whose touch mysterious may on earth dissolve Those links of music, elsewhere will evolve Their grand consummate hymn, from passion-gusts made free! IV.—ON WATCHING THE FLIGHT OF A SKY-LARK. Upward and upward still!—in pearly light The clouds are steep'd; the vernal spirit sighs With bliss in every wind, and crystal skies Woo thee, O bird! to thy celestial height; Bird piercing Heaven with music! thy free flight Hath meaning for all bosoms; most of all For those wherein the rapture and the might Of poesy lie deep, and strive, and burn, For their high place: O heirs of genius! learn From the sky's bird your way!—No joy may fill Your hearts, no gift of holy strength be won To bless your songs, ye children of the sun! Save by the unswerving flight—upward and upward still! V.—A THOUGHT OF THE SEA. My earliest memories to thy shores are bound, Thy solemn shores, thou ever-chanting main! The first rich sunsets, kindling thought profound In my lone being, made thy restless plain As the vast shining floor of some dread fane, All paved with glass and fire. Yet, O blue deep! Thou that no trace of human hearts dost keep, Never to thee did love with silvery chain Draw my soul's dream, which through all nature sought What waves deny;—some bower of steadfast bliss, A home to twine with fancy, feeling, thought, As with sweet flowers:—But chasten'd hope for this Now turns from earth's green valleys, as from thee, To that sole changeless world, where “there is no more sea.” VI.—DISTANT SOUND OF THE SEA AT EVENING. Yet, rolling far up some green mountain dale, Oft let me hear, as ofttimes I have heard, Thy swell, thou deep! when evening calls the bird And bee to rest; when summer tints grow pale, Seen through the gathering of a dewy veil, And peasant steps are hastening to repose, And gleaming flocks lie down, and flower-cups close To the last whisper of the falling gale. Then, 'midst the dying of all other sound, When the soul hears thy distant voice profound, Lone-worshipping, and knows that through the night 'Twill worship still, then most its anthem tone Speaks to our being of the Eternal One, Who girds tired nature with unslumbering might. VII.—THE RIVER CLWYD IN NORTH WALES. See Vignette in Vol. VI. O Cambrian river, with slow music gliding By pastoral hills, old woods, and ruin'd towers; Now 'midst thy reeds and golden willows hiding, Now gleaming forth by some rich bank of flowers; Long flow'd the current of my life's clear hours Onward with thine, whose voice yet haunts my dream, Though time and change, and other mightier powers, Far from thy side have borne me. Thou, smooth stream! Art winding still thy sunny meads along, Murm'ring to cottage and grey hall thy song, Low, sweet, unchanged. My being's tide hath pass'd Through rocks and storms; yet will I not complain, If thus wrought free and pure from earthly stain, Brightly its waves may reach their parent-deep at last. VIII.—ORCHARD BLOSSOMS. Doth thy heart stir within thee at the sight Of orchard blooms upon the mossy bough? Doth their sweet household smile waft back the glow Of childhood's morn?—the wondering fresh delight In earth's new colouring, then all strangely bright, A joy of fairyland?—Doth some old nook, Haunted by visions of thy first-loved book, Rise on thy soul, with faint-streak'd blossoms white, Shower'd o'er the turf, and the lone primrose knot, And robin's nest, still faithful to the spot, And the bee's dreamy chime?—O gentle friend! The world's cold breath, not Time's, this life bereaves Of vernal gifts—Time hallows what he leaves, And will for us endear spring-memories to the end. May 8th. IX.—TO A DISTANT SCENE. Still are the cowslips from thy bosom springing, O far-off grassy dell?—and dost thou see, When southern winds first wake the vernal singing, The star-gleam of the wood anemone? Doth the shy ring-dove haunt thee yet—the bee Hang on thy flowers as when I breathed farewell To their wild blooms? and round my beechen tree Still, in green softness, doth the moss-bank swell? —Oh! strange illusion by the fond heart wrought, Whose own warm life suffuses nature's face! —My being's tide of many-coloured thought Hath pass'd from thee, and now, rich, leafy place! I paint thee oft, scarce consciously, a scene, Silent, forsaken, dim, shadow'd by what hath been. X.—A REMEMBRANCE OF GRASMERE. O vale and lake, within your mountain-urn Smiling so tranquilly, and set so deep! Oft doth your dreamy loveliness return, Colouring the tender shadows of my sleep With light Elysian; for the hues that steep Your shores in melting lustre, seem to float On golden clouds from spirit-lands remote, Isles of the blest; and in our memory keep Their place with holiest harmonies: fair scene, Most loved by evening and her dewy star! Oh! ne'er may man, with touch unhallow'd, jar The perfect music of thy charm serene! Still, still unchanged, may one sweet region wear Smiles that subdue the soul to love, and tears, and prayer. XI.—THOUGHTS CONNECTED WITH TREES. Trees, gracious trees! how rich a gift ye are, Crown of the earth! to human hearts and eyes! How doth the thought of home, in lands afar, Link'd with your forms and kindly whisperings rise! How the whole picture of a childhood lies Oft 'midst your boughs forgotten, buried deep! Till gazing through them up the summer skies As hush'd we stand, a breeze perchance may creep And old sweet leaf-sounds reach the inner world Where memory coils—and lo! at once unfurl'd The past, a glowing scroll, before our sight, Spreads clear! while gushing from their long-seal'd urn Young thoughts, pure dreams, undoubting prayers return, And a lost mother's eye gives back its holy light. XII.—THE SAME. And ye are strong to shelter!—all meek things, All that need home and covert, love your shade! Birds of shy song, and low-voiced quiet springs, And nun-like violets, by the wind betray'd. Childhood beneath your fresh green tents hath play'd With his first primrose-wealth: there love hath sought A veiling gloom for his unutter'd thought; And silent grief, of day's keen glare afraid, A refuge for her tears; and ofttimes there Hath lone devotion found a place of prayer, A native temple, solemn, hush'd, and dim; For wheresoe'er your murm'ring tremors thrill The woody twilight, there man's heart hath still Confess'd a spirit's breath, and heard a ceaseless hymn. XIII.—ON READING PAUL AND VIRGINIA IN CHILDHOOD. O gentle story of the Indian isle! I loved thee in my lonely childhood well On the sea-shore, when day's last purple smile Slept on the waters, and their hollow swell And dying cadence lent a deeper spell Unto thine ocean-pictures. 'Midst thy palms And strange bright birds, my fancy joy'd to dwell, And watch the southern cross through midnight calms, And track the spicy woods. Yet more I bless'd Thy vision of sweet love; kind, trustful, true, Lighting the citron groves—a heavenly guest, With such pure smiles as Paradise once knew. Even then my young heart wept o'er the world's power, To reach and blight that holiest Eden flower. XIV.—A THOUGHT AT SUNSET. Still that last look is solemn! though thy rays, O sun! to-morrow will give back, we know, The joy to nature's heart. Yet through the glow Of clouds that mantle thy decline, our gaze Tracks thee with love half fearful; and in days When earth too much adored thee, what a swell Of mournful passion, deepening mighty lays, Told how the dying bade thy light farewell, O sun of Greece! O glorious, festal sun! Lost, lost!—for them thy golden hours were done, And darkness lay before them! Happier far Are we, not thus to thy bright wheels enchain'd, Not thus for thy last parting unsustain'd, Heirs of a purer day, with its unsetting star. XV.—IMAGES OF PATRIARCHAL LIFE. Calm scenes of patriarch life!—how long a power Your unworn pastoral images retain O'er the true heart, which in its childhood's hour Drank their pure freshness deep! The camels' train Winding in patience o'er the desert plain— The tent, the palm-tree, the reposing flock, The gleaming fount, the shadow of the rock, Oh! by how subtle, yet how strong a chain, And in the influence of its touch how bless'd, Are these things link'd, in many a thoughtful breast, To household memories, for all change endear'd! The matin bird, the ripple of a stream Beside our native porch—the hearth-light's gleam The voices, earliest by the soul revered! XVI.—ATTRACTION OF THE EAST. What secret current of man's nature turns Unto the golden east with ceaseless flow? Still, where the sunbeam at its fountain burns, The pilgrim spirit would adore and glow; Rapt in high thoughts, though weary, faint and slow, Still doth the traveller through the deserts wind Led by those old Chaldean stars, which know Where pass'd the shepherd fathers of mankind. Is it some quenchless instinct, which from far Still points to where our alienated home Lay in bright peace? O thou true eastern star Saviour! atoning Lord! where'er we roam, Draw still our hearts to thee; else, else how vain Their hope, the fair lost birthright to regain! XVII.—TO AN AGED FRIEND. The late Dr Percival of Dublin. Not long thy voice amongst us may be heard, Servant of God!—thy day is almost done; The charm now lingering in thy look and word Is that which hangs about thy setting sun, That which the spirit of decay hath won Still from revering love. Yet doth the sense Of life immortal—progress but begun— Pervade thy mien with such clear eloquence, That hope, not sadness, breathes from thy decline; And the loved flowers which round thee smile farewell, Of more than vernal glory seem to tell, By thy pure spirit touch'd with light divine; While we, to whom its parting gleams are given, Forget the grave in trustful thoughts of heaven. XVIII.—FOLIAGE. Come forth, and let us through our hearts receive The joy of verdure!—see, the honied lime Showers cool green light o'er banks where wildflowers weave Thick tapestry; and woodbine tendrils climb Up the brown oak from buds of moss and thyme. The rich deep masses of the sycamore Hang heavy with the fulness of their prime, And the white poplar, from its foliage hoar, Scatters forth gleams like moonlight, with each gale That sweeps the boughs:—the chestnut flowers are past, The crowning glories of the hawthorn fail, But arches of sweet eglantine are cast From every hedge:—Oh! never may we lose, Dear friend! our fresh delight in simplest nature's hues! June 2d. XIX.—A PRAYER. Father in Heaven! from whom the simplest flower On the high Alps or fiery desert thrown, Draws not sweet odour or young life alone, But the deep virtue of an inborn power To cheer the wanderer in his fainting hour, With thoughts of Thee; to strengthen, to infuse Faith, love, and courage, by the tender hues That speak thy presence; oh! with such a dower Grace thou my song!—the precious gift bestow From thy pure Spirit's treasury divine, To wake one tear of purifying flow, To soften one wrung heart for Thee and thine; So shall the life breathed through the lowly strain, Be as the meek wild-flower's—if transient, yet not vain. XX.—PRAYER CONTINUED. “What in me is dark Illumine; what is low raise and support.” Milton. Far are the wings of intellect astray, That strive not, Father! to thy heavenly seat; They rove, but mount not; and the tempests beat Still on their plumes:—O source of mental day! Chase from before my spirit's track the array Of mists and shadows, raised by earthly care In troubled hosts that cross the purer air, And veil the opening of the starry way, Which brightens on to thee!—Oh! guide thou right My thought's weak pinion, clear mine inward sight, The eternal springs of beauty to discern, Welling beside thy throne; unseal mine ear, Nature's true oracles in joy to hear: Keep my soul wakeful still to listen and to learn. XXI.—MEMORIAL OF A CONVERSATION. Yes! all things tell us of a birthright lost, A brightness from our nature pass'd away! Wanderers we seem, that from an alien coast, Would turn to where their Father's mansion lay, And but by some lone flower, that 'midst decay Smiles mournfully, or by some sculptured stone, Revealing dimly, with grey moss o'ergrown, The faint-worn impress of its glory's day, Can trace their once-free heritage; though dreams Fraught with its picture, oft in startling gleams Flash o'er their souls.—But One, oh! One alone, For us the ruin'd fabric may rebuild, And bid the wilderness again be fill'd, With Eden-flowers—One, mighty to atone! June 27th. For this corrected chronology of these sonnets, we are indebted to the Rev. R. P. Graves, Bowness. RECORDS OF THE AUTUMN OF 1834. I.—THE RETURN TO POETRY. Once more the eternal melodies from far, Woo me like songs of home: once more discerning Through fitful clouds the pure majestic star, Above the poet's world serenely burning, Thither my soul, fresh-wing'd by love, is turning, As o'er the waves the wood-bird seeks her nest, For those green heights of dewy stillness yearning, Whence glorious minds o'erlook this earth's unrest. —Now be the spirit of Heaven's truth my guide Through the bright land!—that no brief gladness, found In passing bloom, rich odour, or sweet sound, May lure my footsteps from their aim aside: Their true, high quest—to seek, if ne'er to gain, The inmost, purest shrine of that august domain. September 9th. II.—TO SILVIO PELLICO, ON READING HIS “PRIGIONE.” There are who climb the mountain's heathery side, Or, in life's vernal strength triumphant, urge The bark's fleet rushing through the crested surge, Or spur the courser's fiery race of pride Over the green savannas, gleaming wide By some vast lake; yet thus, on foaming sea, Or chainless wild, reign far less nobly free, Than thou, in that lone dungeon, glorified By thy brave suffering.—Thou from its dark cell Fierce thought and baleful passion didst exclude, Filling the dedicated solitude With God; and where His Spirit deigns to dwell, Though the worn frame in fetters withering lie, There throned in peace divine is liberty! III.—TO THE SAME, RELEASED. How flows thy being now?—like some glad hymn, One strain of solemn rapture?—doth thine eye Wander through tears of voiceless feeling dim, O'er the crown'd Alps, that, 'midst the upper sky, Sleep in the sunlight of thine Italy? Or is thy gaze of reverent love profound, Unto these dear parental faces bound, Which, with their silvery hair, so oft glanced by, Haunting thy prison-dreams?—Where'er thou art, Blessings be shed upon thine inmost heart, Joy, from kind looks, blue skies, and flowery sod, For that pure voice of thoughtful wisdom sent Forth from thy cell, in sweetness eloquent, Of love to man, and quenchless trust in God! IV.—ON A SCENE IN THE DARGLE. A beautiful valley in the county of Wicklow. 'Twas a bright moment of my life when first, O thou pure stream through rocky portals flowing! That temple-chamber of thy glory burst On my glad sight!—thy pebbly couch lay glowing With deep mosaic hues; and, richly throwing O'er thy cliff-walls a tinge of autumn's vest, High bloom'd the heath-flowers, and the wild wood's crest Was touch'd with gold.—Flow ever thus, bestowing Gifts of delight, sweet stream! on all who move Gently along thy shores; and oh! if love, —True love, in secret nursed, with sorrow fraught— Should sometimes bear his treasured griefs to thee, Then full of kindness let thy music be, Singing repose to every troubled thought! V.—ON READING COLERIDGE'S EPITAPH. WRITTEN BY HIMSELF. “Stop, Christian passer-by! stop, child of God! And read with gentle breast;—Beneath this sod A Poet lies, or that which once seem'd he; Oh! lift one thought in prayer for S. T. C.! That He, who once in vain, with toil of breath, Found death in life, may here find life in death! Mercy, for praise; to be forgiven, for Fame, He ask'd and hoped through Christ. Do thou the same!” Spirit! so oft in radiant freedom soaring, High through seraphic mysteries unconfined, And oft, a diver through the deep of mind, Its caverns, far below its waves, exploring; And oft such strains of breezy music pouring, As, with the floating sweetness of their sighs, Could still all fevers of the heart, restoring Awhile that freshness left in Paradise; Say, of those glorious wanderings what the goal? What the rich fruitage to man's kindred soul From wealth of thine bequeathed? O strong and high, And sceptred intellect! thy goal confess'd Was the Redeemer's Cross—thy last bequest One lesson breathing thence profound humility: VI.—ON THE DATURA ARBOREA. Majestic plant! such fairy dreams as lie Nursed, where the bee sucks in the cowslip's bell, Are not thy train:—those flowers of vase-like swell Clear, large, with dewy moonlight fill'd from high, And in their monumental purity Serenely drooping, round thee seem to draw Visions link'd strangely with that silent awe Which broods o'er Sculpture's works.—A meet ally For those heroic forms, the simply grand Art thou: and worthy, carved by plastic hand, Above some kingly poet's tomb to shine In spotless marble; honouring one, whose strain Soar'd upon wings of thought that knew no stain Free through the starry heavens of truth divine. VII.—DESIGN AND PERFORMANCE. They float before my soul, the fair designs Which I would body forth to Life and Power, Like clouds, that with their wavering hues and lines Pourtray majestic buildings:—Dome and tower, Bright spire, that through the rainbow and the shower Points to th' unchanging stars; and high arcade Far-sweeping to some glorious altar, made For holiest rites:—meanwhile the waning hour Melts from me, and by fervent dreams o'erwrought, I sink:—O friend! O link'd with each high thought Aid me, of those rich visions to detain All I may grasp; until thou see'st fulfill'd, While time and strength allow, my hope to build For lowly hearts devout, but one enduring fane! October 18th. VIII.—HOPE OF FUTURE COMMUNION WITH NATURE. If e'er again my spirit be allow'd Converse with nature in her chambers deep, Where lone, and mantled with the rolling cloud, She broods o'er new-born waters, as they leap In sword-like flashes down the heathery steep From caves of mystery;—if I roam once more Where dark pines quiver to the torrent's roar, And voiceful oaks respond!—shall I not reap A more ennobling joy, a loftier power, Than e'er was shed on life's more vernal hour, From such communion?—yes! I then shall know, That not in vain have sorrow, love, and thought, Their long still work of preparation wrought, For that more perfect sense of God reveal'd below. IX.—DREAMS OF THE DEAD. Oft in still night-dreams a departed face Bends o'er me with sweet earnestness of eye, Wearing no more of earthly pains a trace, But all the tender pity that may lie On the clear brow of Immortality, Calm, yet profound. Soft rays illume that mien, Th' unshadow'd moonlight of some far-off sky Around it floats transparently serene As a pure veil of waters. O rich sleep! Thou hast strong spirits in thy regions deep, Which glorify with reconciling breath, Effacing, brightening, giving forth to shine Beauty's high truth, and how much more divine Thy power when link'd in this, with thy stern brother—Death! X.—THE POETRY OF THE PSALMS. Nobly thy song, O minstrel! rush'd to meet Th' Eternal on the pathway of the blast, With darkness round him, as a mantle, cast, And cherubim to waft his flying seat; Amidst the hills that smoked beneath his feet, With trumpet-voice thy spirit call'd aloud, And bade the trembling rocks his name repeat, And the bent cedars, and the bursting cloud. But far more gloriously to earth made known By that high strain than by the thunder's tone, The flashing torrents, or the ocean's roll, Jehovah spake, through the imbreathing fire, Nature's vast realms for ever to inspire With the deep worship of a living soul. DESPONDENCY AND ASPIRATION. Partly composed during the Author's last illness. “Per correr miglior acqua alza le vele, Omai la navicella del mio Intelletto.” Dante. My soul was mantled with dark shadows, born Of lonely Fear, disquieted in vain; Its phantoms hung around the star of morn, A cloud-like weeping train; Through the long day they dimm'd the autumn gold On all the glistening leaves; and wildly roll'd, When the last farewell flush of light was glowing, Across the sunset sky; O'er its rich isles of vaporous glory throwing One melancholy dye. And when the solemn Night Came rushing with her might Of stormy oracles from caves unknown, Then with each fitful blast Prophetic murmurs pass'd, Wakening or answering some deep Sybil tone, Far buried in my breast, yet prompt to rise With every gusty wail that o'er the wind-harp flies. “Fold, fold thy wings,” they cried, “and strive no more, Faint spirit, strive no more!—for thee too strong Are outward ill and wrong, And inward wasting fires!—Thou canst not soar Free on a starry way Beyond their blighting sway, At Heaven's high gate serenely to adore! How shouldst thou hope Earth's fetters to unbind? O passionate, yet weak! O trembler to the wind! “Never shall aught but broken music flow From joy of thine, deep love, or tearful woe; Such homeless notes as through the forest sigh, From the reeds hollow shaken, When sudden breezes waken Their vague wild symphony: No power is theirs, and no abiding-place In human hearts; their sweetness leaves no trace— Born only so to die! “Never shall aught but perfume, faint and vain, On the fleet pinion of the changeful hour, From thy bruised life again A moment's essence breathe; Thy life, whose trampled flower Into the blessed wreath Of household charities no longer bound, Lies pale and withering on the barren ground. “So fade, fade on! thy gift of love shall cling, A coiling sadness, round thy heart and brain, A silent, fruitless, yet undying thing, All sensitive to pain! And still the shadow of vain dreams shall fall O'er thy mind's world, a daily darkening pall. Fold, then, thy wounded wing, and sink subdued, In cold and unrepining quietude!” Then my soul yielded; spells of numbing breath Crept o'er it heavy with a dew of death, Its powers, like leaves before the night rain, closing; And, as by conflict of wild sea-waves toss'd On the chill bosom of some desert coast, Mutely aud hopelessly I lay reposing. When silently it seem'd As if a soft mist gleam'd Before my passive sight, and, slowly curling, To many a shape and hue Of vision'd beauty grew, Like a wrought banner, fold by fold unfurling. Oh! the rich scenes that o'er mine inward eye Unrolling then swept by, With dreamy motion! Silvery seas were there Lit by large dazzling stars, and arch'd by skies Of southern midnight's most transparent dyes, And gemm'd with many an island, wildly fair, Which floated past me into orient day, Still gathering lustre on th' illumin'd way, Till its high groves of wondrous flowering trees Colour'd the silvery seas. And then a glorious mountain-chain uprose, Height above spiry height! A soaring solitude of woods and snows, All steep'd in golden light! While as it pass'd, those regal peaks unveiling, I heard, methought, a waving of dread wings And mighty sounds, as if the vision hailing, From lyres that quiver'd through ten thousand strings: Or as if waters forth to music leaping, From many a cave, the Alpine Echo's hall, On their bold way victoriously were sweeping, Link'd in majestic anthems! while through all That billowy swell and fall, Voices, like ringing crystal, fill'd the air With inarticulate melody, that stirr'd My being's core; then, moulding into word Their piercing sweetness, bade me rise and bear In that great choral strain my trembling part Of tones, by love and faith struck from a human heart. Return no more, vain bodings of the night! A happier oracle within my soul Hath swell'd to power;—a clear unwavering light Mounts through the battling clouds that round me roll, And to a new control Nature's full harp gives forth rejoicing tones, Wherein my glad sense owns The accordant rush of elemental sound To one consummate harmony profound; One grand Creation Hymn, Whose notes the seraphim Lift to the glorious height of music wing'd and crown'd. Shall not those notes find echoes in my lyre, Faithful though faint?—Shall not my spirit's fire, If slowly, yet unswervingly, ascend Now to its fount and end? Shall not my earthly love, all purified, Shine forth a heavenward guide? An angel of bright power?—and strongly bear My being upward into holier air, Where fiery passion-clouds have no abode, And the sky's temple-arch o'erflows with God? The radiant hope new-born Expands like rising morn In my life's life: and as a ripening rose, The crimson shadow of its glory throws More vivid, hour by hour, on some pure stream; So from that hope are spreading Rich hues, o'er nature shedding, Each day, a clearer, spiritual gleam. Let not those rays fade from me—once enjoy'd, Father of spirits! let them not depart! Leaving the chill'd earth, without form and void, Darken'd by mine own heart! Lift, aid, sustain me! Thou, by whom alone All lovely gifts and pure In the soul's grasp endure; Thou, to the steps of whose eternal throne All knowledge flows—a sea for evermore Breaking its crested waves on that sole shore— O consecrate my life! that I may sing Of Thee with joy that hath a living spring, In a full heart of music!—Let my lays Through the resounding mountains waft thy praise, And with that theme the wood's green cloisters fill, And make their quivering leafy dimness thrill To the rich breeze of song! Oh! let me wake The deep religion, which hath dwelt from yore, Silently brooding by lone cliff and lake, And wildest river shore! And let me summon all the voices dwelling Where eagles build, and cavern'd rills are welling, And where the cataract's organ-peal is swelling, In that one spirit gather'd to adore! Forgive, O Father! if presumptuous thought Too daringly in aspiration rise! Let not thy child all vainly have been taught By weakness, and by wanderings, and by sighs Of sad confession!—lowly be my heart, And on its penitential altar spread The offerings worthless, till Thy grace impart The fire from Heaven, whose touch alone can shed Life, radiance, virtue!—let that vital spark Pierce my whole being, wilder'd else and dark! Thine are all holy things—O make me Thine, So shall I, too, be pure—a living shrine Unto that Spirit, which goes forth from Thee, Strong and divinely free, Bearing thy gifts of wisdom on its flight, And brooding o'er them with a dove-like wing, Till thought, word, song, to Thee in worship spring, Immortally endow'd for liberty and light. THOUGHTS DURING SICKNESS. I.—INTELLECTUAL POWERS. O Thought! O Memory! gems for ever heaping High in the illumined chambers of the mind, And thou, divine Imagination! keeping Thy lamp's lone star 'mid shadowy hosts enshrined; How in one moment rent and disentwined. At Fever's fiery touch, apart they fall, Your glorious combinations!—broken all, As the sand-pillars by the desert's wind Scatter'd to whirling dust!—Oh, soon uncrown'd! Well may your parting swift, your strange return, Subdue the soul to lowliness profound, Guiding its chasten'd vision to discern How by meek Faith Heaven's portals must be pass'd Ere it can hold your gifts inalienably fast. II.—SICKNESS LIKE NIGHT. Thou art like Night, O Sickness! deeply stilling Within my heart the world's disturbing sound, And the dim quiet of my chamber filling With low sweet voices by Life's tumult drown'd, Thou art like awful Night!—thou gather'st round The things that are unseen—though close they lie,— And with a truth, clear, startling, and profound, Givest their dread presence to our mental eye. —Thou art like starry, spiritual Night! High and immortal thoughts attend thy way, And revelations, which the common light Brings not, though wakening with its rosy ray All outward life:—Be welcome then thy rod, Before whose touch my soul unfolds itself to God. III.—ON RETZSCH'S DESIGN OF THE ANGEL OF DEATH. This sonnet was suggested by the following passage out of Mrs Jameson's Visits and Sketches at Home and Abroad, in a description she gives of a visit paid to the artist Retzsch, near Dresden:—“Afterwards he placed upon his easel a wonderous face, which made me shrink back—not with terror, for it was perfectly beautiful,—but with awe, for it was unspeakably fearful: the hair streamed back from the pale brow—the orbs of sight appeared at first two dark, hollow, unfathomable spaces, like those in a skull; but when I drew nearer and looked attentively, two lovely living eyes looked at me again out of the depth of the shadow, as if from the bottom of an abyss. The mouth was divinely sweet, but sad, and the softest repose rested on every feature. This, he told me, was the Angel of Death.” Well might thine awful image thus arise With that high calm upon thy regal brow, And the deep, solemn sweetness in those eyes, Unto the glorious Artist!—Who but thou The fleeting forms of beauty can endow For Him with permanency? — who make those gleams Of brighter life, that colour his lone dreams, Immortal things?—Let others trembling bow, Angel of Death! before thee.—Not to those, Whose spirits with Eternal Truth repose, Art thou a fearful shape!—and oh! for me, How full of welcome would thine aspect shine, Did not the cords of strong affection twine So fast around my soul, it cannot spring to thee! IV.—REMEMBRANCE OF NATURE. O, Nature! thou didst rear me for thine own, With thy free singing-birds and mountain brooks; Feeding my thoughts in primrose-haunted nooks, With fairy fantasies and wood-dreams lone; And thou didst teach me every wandering tone Drawn from thy many-whispering trees and waves, And guide my steps to founts and sparry caves, And where bright mosses wove thee a rich throne 'Midst the green hills:—and now, that far estranged From all sweet sounds and odours of thy breath, Fading I lie, within my heart unchanged, So glows the love of thee, that not for Death Seems that pure passion's fervour—but ordain'd To meet on brighter shores thy Majesty unstain'd. V.—FLIGHT OF THE SPIRIT. Whither, oh! whither wilt thou wing thy way? What solemn region first upon thy sight Shall break, unveil'd for terror or delight? What hosts, magnificent in dread array? My spirit! when thy prison-house of clay, After long strife is rent?—fond, fruitless guest! The unfledged bird, within his narrow nest Sees but a few green branches o'er him play, And through their parting leaves, by fits reveal'd, A glimpse of summer sky:—nor knows the field Wherein his dormant powers must yet be tried. —Thou art that bird!—of what beyond thee lies Far in the untrack'd, immeasurable skies, Knowing but this—that thou shalt find thy Guide! VI.—FLOWERS. Welcome, O pure and lovely forms, again Unto the shadowy stillness of my room! For not alone ye bring a joyous train Of summer-thoughts attendant on your bloom— Visions of freshness, of rich bowery gloom, Of the low murmurs filling mossy dells, Of stars that look down on your folded bells Through dewy leaves, of many a wild perfume Greeting the wanderer of the hill and grove Like sudden music; more than this ye bring— Far more; ye whisper of the all-fostering love, Which thus hath clothed you, and whose dove-like wing Broods o'er the sufferer drawing fever'd breath, Whether the couch be that of life or death. VII.—RECOVERY. Written under the false impression occasioned by a temporary improvement in strength. Back then, once more to breast the waves of life, To battle on against the unceasing spray, To sink o'erwearied in the stormy strife, And rise to strife again; yet on my way, Oh! linger still, thou light of better day, Born in the hours of loneliness, and you, Ye childlike thoughts, the holy and the true, Ye that came bearing, while subdued I lay, The faith, the insight of life's vernal morn Back on my soul, a clear bright sense, new-born, Now leave me not! but as, profoundly pure, A blue stream rushes through a darker lake Unchang'd, e'en thus with me your journey take, Wafting sweet airs of heaven through this low world obscure. SABBATH SONNET. COMPOSED BY MRS HEMANS A FEW DAYS BEFORE HER DEATH, AND DEDICATED TO HER BROTHER. How many blessed groups this hour are bending, Through England's primrose meadow-paths, their way Towards spire and tower, 'midst shadowy elms ascending, Whence the sweet chimes proclaim the hallow'd day! The halls from old heroic ages grey Pour their fair children forth; and hamlets low, With whose thick orchard-blooms the soft winds play, Send out their inmates in a happy flow, Like a freed vernal stream. I may not tread With them those pathways,—to the feverish bed Of sickness bound;—yet, oh, my God! I bless Thy mercy, that with Sabbath peace hath fill'd My chasten'd heart, and all its throbbings still'd To one deep calm of lowliest thankfulness. April 26th, 1835. JUVENILE POEMS BY FELICIA DOROTHEA BROWNE. From a Volume of Poems, by Felicia Dorothea Browne, published in 1808, containing Pieces written between the ages of eight and thirteen. ON MY MOTHER'S BIRTHDAY. WRITTEN AT THE AGE OF EIGHT. Clad in all their brightest green, This day the verdant fields are seen; The tuneful birds begin their lay, To celebrate thy natal day. The breeze is still, the sea is calm, And the whole scene combines to charm; The flowers revive, this charming May, Because it is thy natal day. The sky is blue, the day serene, And only pleasure now is seen; The rose, the pink, the tulip gay, Combine to bless thy natal day. A PRAYER. WRITTEN AT THE AGE OF NINE. Oh! God, my Father and my Friend, Ever thy blessings to me send; Let me have Virtue for my guide, And Wisdom always at my side; Thus cheerfully through life I'll go, Nor ever feel the sting of woe; Contented with the humblest lot, Happy, though in the meanest cot. ADDRESS TO THE DEITY. WRITTEN AT THE AGE OF ELEVEN. The infant muse, Jehovah! would aspire To swell the adoration of the lyre: Source of all good, oh! teach my voice to sing Thee, from whom Nature's genuine beauties spring; Thee, God of truth, omnipotent and wise, Who saidst to Chaos, “let the earth arise.” Oh! author of the rich luxuriant year, Love, Truth, and Mercy, in thy works appear: Within their orbs the planets dost Thou keep, And e'en hast limited the mighty deep. Oh! could I number thy inspiring ways, And wake the voice of animated praise! Ah, no! the theme shall swell a cherub's note; To Thee celestial hymns of rapture float. 'Tis not for me, in lowly strains to sing Thee, God of mercy,—heaven's immortal King. Yet to that happiness I'd fain aspire; Oh! fill my heart with elevated fire: With angel-songs an artless voice shall blend, The grateful offering shall to Thee ascend. Yes! Thou wilt breathe a spirit o'er my lyre, And “fill my beating heart with sacred fire!” And when to Thee my youth, my life, I've given, Raise me, to join Eliza, A sister whom the author had lost. blest in Heaven. SONNET TO MY MOTHER. WRITTEN AT THE AGE OF TWELVE. To thee, maternal guardian of my youth, I pour the genuine numbers free from art; The lays inspired by gratitude and truth, For thou wilt prize the effusion of the heart. Oh! be it mine, with sweet and pious care, To calm thy bosom in the hour of grief; With soothing tenderness to chase the tear, With fond endearments to impart relief. Be mine thy warm affection to repay With duteous love in thy declining hours; My filial hand shall strew unfading flowers, Perennial roses to adorn thy way; Still may thy grateful children round thee smile, Their pleasing care affliction shall beguile. SONNET. WRITTEN AT THE AGE OF THIRTEEN. 'Tis sweet to think the spirits of the blest May hover round the virtuous man's repose; And oft in visions animate his breast, And scenes of bright beatitude disclose. The ministers of Heaven with pure control, May bid his sorrow and emotion cease, Inspire the pious fervour of his soul, And whisper to his bosom hallow'd peace. Ah! tender thought, that oft with sweet relief May charm the bosom of a weeping friend, Beguile with magic power the tear of grief, And pensive pleasure with devotion blend; While oft he fancies music, sweetly faint, The airy lay of some departed saint. RURAL WALKS. WRITTEN AT THE AGE OF THIRTEEN. Oh! may I ever pass my happy hours In Cambrian valleys and romantic bowers; For every spot in sylvan beauty drest, And every landscape charms my youthful breast. And much I love to hail the vernal morn, When flowers of spring the mossy seat adorn; And sometimes through the lonely wood I stray, To cull the tender rosebuds in my way; And seek in every wild secluded dell, The weeping cowslip and the azure bell; With all the blossoms, fairer in the dew, To form the gay festoon of varied hue. And oft I seek the cultivated green, The fertile meadow, and the village scene; Where rosy children sport around the cot, Or gather woodbine from the garden spot. And there I wander by the cheerful rill, That murmurs near the osiers and the mill; To view the smiling peasants turn the hay, And listen to their pleasing festive lay. I love to loiter in the spreading grove, Or in the mountain scenery to rove; Where summits rise in awful grace around, With hoary moss and tufted verdure crown'd; Where cliffs in solemn majesty are piled, “And frown upon the vale” with grandeur wild: And there I view the mouldering tower sublime, Array'd in all the blending shades of Time. The airy upland and the woodland green, The valley, and romantic mountain scene; The lowly hermitage, or fair domain, The dell retired, or willow-shaded lane; “And every spot in sylvan beauty drest, And every landscape, charms my youthful breast.” SONNET. WRITTEN AT THE AGE OF THIRTEEN. I love to hail the mild and balmy hour, When evening spreads around her twilight veil; When dews descend on every languid flower, And sweet and tranquil is the summer gale. Then let me wander by the peaceful tide, While o'er the wave the breezes lightly play; To hear the waters murmur as they glide, To mark the fading smile of closing day. There let me linger, blest in visions dear, Till the soft moonbeams tremble on the seas; While melting sounds decay on fancy's ear, Of airy music floating on the breeze. For still when evening sheds the genial dews, That pensive hour is sacred to the muse. TO MY MOTHER. From “The Domestic Affections and Other Poems,” by Felicia Dorothea Browne. Published in 1812. If e'er for human bliss or woe I feel the sympathetic glow; If e'er my heart has learn'd to know The gen'rous wish or prayer; Who sow'd the germ with tender hand? Who mark'd its infant leaves expand? My mother's fostering care. And if one flower of charms refined May grace the garden of my mind; 'Twas she who nursed it there: She loved to cherish and adorn Each blossom of the soil; To banish every weed and thorn, That oft opposed her toil! And oh! if e'er I sigh'd to claim, The palm, the living palm of Fame, The glowing wreath of praise; If e'er I wish'd the glittering stores, That Fortune on her fav'rite pours; 'Twas but that wealth and fame, if mine, Round Thee, with streaming rays might shine, And gild thy sun-bright days! Yet not that splendour, pomp, and power, Might then irradiate every hour; For these, my mother! well I know, On thee no raptures could bestow; But could thy bounty, warm and kind, Be, like thy wishes, unconfined; And fall, as manna from the skies, And bid a train of blessings rise, Diffusing joy and peace; The tear-drop, grateful, pure, and bright, For thee would beam with softer light, Than all the diamond's crystal rays, Than all the emerald's lucid blaze; And joys of heaven would thrill thy heart, To bid one bosom-grief depart, One tear, one sorrow cease! Then, oh! may Heaven, that loves to bless, Bestow the power to cheer distress; Make Thee its minister below, To light the cloudy path of woe; To visit the deserted cell, Where indigence is doom'd to dwell; To raise, when drooping to the earth, The blossoms of neglected worth; And round, with liberal hand, dispense The sunshine of beneficence! But ah! if Fate should still deny Delights like these, too rich and high; If grief and pain thy steps assail, In life's remote and wintry vale; Then, as the wild Æolian lyre, Complains with soft entrancing number, When the lone storm awakes the wire, And bids enchantment cease to slumber; So filial love, with soothing voice, E'en then, shall teach thee to rejoice; E'en then, shall sweeter, milder sound, When sorrow's tempest raves around; While dark misfortune's gales destroy, The frail mimosa-buds of hope and joy! TO MY YOUNGER BROTHER. On his return from Spain, after the fatal retreat under Sir John Moore, and the battle of Corunna. Though dark are the prospects and heavy the hours, Though life is a desert, and cheerless the way; Yet still shall affection adorn it with flowers, Whose fragrance shall never decay! And lo! to embrace thee, my Brother! she flies, With artless delight, that no words can bespeak; With a sunbeam of transport illuming her eyes, With a smile and a glow on her cheek! From the trophies of war, from the spear and the shield, From scenes of destruction, from perils unblest; Oh! welcome again, to the grove and the field, To the vale of retirement and rest. Then warble, sweet muse! with the lyre and the voice, Oh! gay be the measure and sportive the strain; For light is my heart, and my spirits rejoice, To meet thee, my Brother! again. When the heroes of Albion, still valiant and true, Were bleeding, were falling, with victory crown'd How often would fancy present to my view The horrors that waited thee round! How constant, how fervent, how pure was my prayer, That Heaven would protect thee from danger and harm; That angels of mercy would shield thee with care, In the heat of the combat's alarm! How sad and how often descended the tear, (Ah! long shall remembrance the image retain) How mournful the sigh, when I trembled with fear I might never behold thee again! But the prayer was accepted, the sorrow is o'er, And the tear-drop is fled, like the dew on the rose; Thy dangers, our tears, have endear'd thee the more, And my bosom with tenderness glows! And oh! when the dreams, the enchantments of youth, Bright and transient, have fled, like the rainbow, away; My affection for thee, still unfading in truth, Shall never, oh! never decay! No time can impair it, no change can destroy, Whate'er be the lot I am destined to share; It will smile in the sunshine of hope and of joy, And beam through the cloud of despair! TO MY ELDEST BROTHER (With the British Army in Portugal.) How many a day, in various hues array'd, Bright with gay sunshine, or eclipsed with shade, How many an hour, on silent wing is past, O my loved Brother! since we saw thee last! Since then has childhood ripen'd into youth, And fancy's dreams have fled from sober truth; Her splendid fabrics melting into air, As sage experience waved the wand of care! Yet still thine absence wakes the tender sigh, And the tear trembles in affection's eye! When shall we meet again?—with glowing ray, Heart-soothing hope illumes some future day; Checks the sad thought, beguiles the starting tear, And sings benignly still—that day is near! She, with bright eye, and soul-bewitching voice, Wins us to smile, inspires us to rejoice; Tells, that the hour approaches, to restore Our cherish'd wanderer to his home once more; Where sacred ties his manly worth endear, To faith still true, affection still sincere! Then the past woes, the future's dubious lot, In that blest meeting shall be all forgot! And joy's full radiance gild that sun-bright hour, Though all around th' impending storm should lower. Now distant far, amidst the intrepid host, Albion's firm sons, on Lusitania's coast, (That gallant band, in countless dangers tried, Where glory's pole-star beams their constant guide,) Say, do thy thoughts, my Brother, fondly stray To Cambria's vales and mountains far away? Does fancy oft in busy day-dreams roam, And paint the greeting that awaits at home? Does memory's pencil oft, in mellowing hue, Dear social scenes, departed joys renew; In softer tints delighting to retrace, Each tender image and each well-known face? Yes! wanderer, yes! thy spirit flies to those, Whose love, unalter'd, warm and faithful glows. Oh! could that love, through life's eventful hours Illume thy scenes and strew thy path with flowers! Perennial joy should harmonize thy breast, No struggle rend thee, and no cares molest! But though our tenderness can but bestow The wish, the hope, the prayer, averting woe; Still shall it live, with pure, unclouded flame, In storms, in sunshine, far and near—the same! Still dwell enthroned within th' unvarying heart, And firm and vital—but with life depart! Bronwylfa, Feb. 8th, 1811. LINES WRITTEN IN THE MEMORIES OF ELIZABETH SMITH. Oh, thou! whose pure, exalted mind, Lives in this record, fair and bright; Oh, thou! whose blameless life combined, Soft female charms and grace refined, With science and with light! Celestial maid! whose spirit soar'd Beyond this vale of tears; Whose clear, enlighten'd eye explored The lore of years! Daughter of Heaven! if here, e'en here, The wing of towering thought was thine: If, on this dim and mundane sphere, Fair truth illumed thy bright career, With morning-star divine; How must thy bless'd ethereal soul, Now kindle in her noon-tide ray; And hail, unfetter'd by control, The Fount of Day! E'en now, perhaps, thy seraph eyes, Undimm'd by doubt, nor veil'd by fear, Behold a chain of wonders rise; Gaze on the noon beam of the skies, Transcendent, pure and clear! E'en now, the fair, the good, the true, From mortal sight conceal'd, Bless in one blaze thy raptured view, In light reveal'd! If here, the lore of distant time, And learning's flowers were all thine own; How must thy mind ascend sublime, Matured in heaven's empyreal clime, To light's unclouded throne! Perhaps, e'en now, thy kindling glance, Each orb of living fire explores; Darts o'er creation's wide expanse, Admires—adores! Oh! if that lightning-eye surveys This dark and sublunary plain; How must the wreath of human praise, Fade, wither, vanish, in thy gaze, So dim, so pale, so vain! How, like a faint and shadowy dream, Must quiver learning's brightest ray; While on thine eyes, with lucid stream, The sun of glory pours his beam, Perfection's day! THE SILVER LOCKS. ADDRESSED TO AN AGED FRIEND. Though youth may boast the curls that flow In sunny waves of auburn glow; As graceful on thy hoary head, Has time the robe of honour spread, And there, oh! softly, softly shed, His wreath of snow! As frost-work on the trees display'd, When weeping Flora leaves the shade, E'en more than Flora, charms the sight; E'en so thy locks of purest white, Survive, in age's frost-work bright, Youth's vernal rose decay'd! To grace the nymph whose tresses play Light on the sportive breeze of May, Let other bards the garland twine, Where sweets of every hue combine; Those locks revered, that silvery shine, Invite my lay! Less white the summer-cloud sublime, Less white the winter's fringing rime; Nor do Belinda's lovelier seem, (A Poet's blest immortal theme,) Than thine, which wear the moonlight beam Of rev'rend Time! Long may the graceful honours smile, Like moss on some declining pile; Oh! much revered! may filial care, Around thee, duteous, long repair, Thy joys with tender bliss to share, Thy pains beguile! Long, long, ye snowy ringlets, wave, Long, long, your much-loved beauty save! May bliss your latest evening crown, Disarm life's winter of its frown, And soft ye hoary hairs go down In gladness to the grave! And as the parting beams of day On mountain-snows reflected play, And tints of roseate lustre shed; Thus, on the snow that crowns thy head, May joy, with evening planet, shed His mildest ray! August 18th, 1809. THE RUIN AND ITS FLOWERS. Sweets of the wild! that breathe and bloom On this lone tower, this ivied wall; Lend to the gale a rich perfume, And grace the ruin in its fall; Though doom'd, remote from careless eye, To smile, to flourish, and to die, In solitude sublime, Oh! ever may the spring renew, Your balmy scent and glowing hue, To deck the robe of time! Breathe, fragrance! breathe, enrich the air, Though wasted on its wing unknown! Blow, flow'rets! blow, though vainly fair, Neglected and alone! These flowers that long withstood the blast, These mossy towers are mouldering fast, While Flora's children stay— To mantle o'er the lonely pile, To gild Destruction with a smile, And beautify Decay! Sweets of the wild! uncultured blowing, Neglected in luxuriance glowing; From the dark ruins frowning near, Your charms in brighter tints appear, And richer blush assume; You smile with softer beauty crown'd, Whilst all is desolate around, Like sunshine on a tomb! Thou hoary pile, majestic still, Memento of departed fame! While roving o'er the moss clad hill, I ponder on thine ancient name! Here Grandeur, Beauty, Valour sleep, That here, so oft, have shone supreme; While Glory, Honour, Fancy, weep, That vanish'd is the golden dream! Where are the banners, waving proud, To kiss the summer-gale of even— All purple as the morning-cloud, All streaming to the winds of Heaven? Where is the harp, by rapture strung, To melting song, or martial story? Where are the lays the minstrel sung, To loveliness, or glory? Lorn echo of these mouldering walls, To thee no festal measure calls; No music through the desert halls, Awakes thee to rejoice! How still thy sleep! as death profound, As if, within this lonely round, A step—a note—a whisper'd sound, Had ne'er aroused thy voice! Thou hear'st the zephyr murmuring, dying, Thou hear'st the foliage waving, sighing; But ne'er again shall harp or song, These dark deserted courts along, Disturb thy calm repose; The harp is broke, the song is fled, The voice is hush'd, the bard is dead; And never shall thy tones repeat, Or lofty strain, or carol sweet, With plaintive close! Proud Castle! though the days are flown, When once thy towers in glory shone; When music through thy turrets rung, When banners o'er thy ramparts hung, Though 'midst thine arches, frowning lone, Stern Desolation rear his throne; And Silence, deep and awful, reign, Where echo'd once the choral strain; Yet oft, dark ruin! lingering here, The Muse will hail thee with a tear; Here when the moonlight, quiv'ring, beams, And through the fringing ivy streams, And softens every shade sublime, And mellows every tint of Time— Oh! here shall Contemplation love, Unseen and undisturb'd, to rove; And bending o'er some mossy tomb, Where Valour sleeps, or Beauties bloom, Shall weep for Glory's transient day, And Grandeur's evanescent ray And list'ning to the swelling blast, Shall wake the Spirit of the Past, Call up the forms of ages fled, Of warriors and of minstrels dead; Who sought the field, who struck the lyre, With all Ambition's kindling fire! Nor wilt thou, Spring! refuse to breathe Soft odours on this desert air; Refuse to twine thine earliest wreath, And fringe these towers with garlands fair! Sweets of the wild, oh! ever bloom, Unheeded on this ivied wall! Lend to the gale a rich perfume, And grace the ruin in its fall! Thus, round Misfortune's holy head, Would Pity wreaths of honour spread; Like you, thus blooming on this lonely pile, She seeks Despair, with heart-reviving smile! CHRISTMAS CAROL. Fair Gratitude! in strain sublime, Swell high to Heaven thy tuneful zeal; And, hailing this auspicious time, Kneel, Adoration! kneel! CHORUS. For lo! the day, th' immortal day, When Mercy's full, benignant ray, Chased every gathering cloud away, And pour'd the noon of light! Rapture! be kindling, mounting, glowing, While from thine eye the tear is flowing, Pure, warm, and bright! 'Twas on this day, oh, Love Divine! The Orient Star's effulgence rose; Then waked the Morn, whose eye benign, Shall never, never close! CHORUS. Messiah! be thy name adored, Eternal, high, redeeming Lord! By grateful worlds be anthems pour'd Emanuel! Prince of Peace! This day, from Heaven's empyreal dwelling, Harp, lyre, and voice, in concert swelling, Bade discord cease! Wake the loud pæan, tune the voice, Children of heaven and sons of earth! Seraphs and men! exult, rejoice, To bless the Saviour's birth! CHORUS. Devotion! light thy purest fire! Transport! on cherub-wing aspire! Praise! wake to Him thy golden lyre, Strike every thrilling chord! While at the Ark of Mercy kneeling We own thy grace, reviving, healing, Redeemer! Lord! THE DOMESTIC AFFECTIONS. Whence are those tranquil joys in mercy given, To light the wilderness with beams of heaven? To sooth our cares, and through the cloud diffuse, Their temper'd sunshine, and celestial hues? Those pure delights, ordain'd on life to throw Gleams of the bliss ethereal natures know? Say, do they grace Ambition's regal throne, When kneeling myriads call the world his own? Or dwell with Lux'ry, in th' enchanted bowers, Where taste and wealth exert creative powers? Favour'd of Heaven! O Genius! are they thine, When round thy brow the wreaths of glory shine; While rapture gazes on thy radiant way, 'Midst the bright realms of clear and mental day? No! sacred joys! 'tis yours to dwell enshrined, Most fondly cherish'd, in the purest mind; To twine with flowers, those loved, endearing ties, On earth so sweet—so perfect in the skies! Nursed on the lap of solitude and shade, The violet smiles, embosom'd in the glade; There sheds her spirit on the lonely gale, Gem of seclusion! treasure of the vale! Thus, far retired from life's tumultuous road, Domestic Bliss has fix'd her calm abode, Where hallow'd Innocence and sweet Repose May strew her shadowy path with many a rose. As, when dread thunder shakes the troubled sky, The cherub, Infancy, can close its eye, And sweetly smile, unconscious of a tear, While viewless angels wave their pinions near; Thus, while around the storms of Discord roll, Borne on resistless wing, from pole to pole; While War's red lightnings desolate the ball, And thrones and empires in destruction fall; Then calm as evening on the silvery wave, When the wind slumbers in the ocean cave, She dwells unruffled, in her bower of rest, Her empire Home!—her throne, Affection's breast! For her, sweet Nature wears her loveliest blooms, And softer sunshine every scene illumes, When Spring awakes the spirit of the breeze, Whose light wing undulates the sleeping seas; When Summer, waving her creative wand, Bids verdure smile, and glowing life expand; Or Autumn's pencil sheds, with magic trace, O'er fading loveliness, a moonlight grace; Oh! still for her, through Nature's boundless reign, No charm is lost no beauty blooms in vain; While mental peace, o'er every prospect bright Throws mellowing tints, and harmonizing light! Lo! borne on clouds, in rushing might sublime, Stern Winter bursting from the polar clime, Triumphant waves his signal-torch on high, The blood-red meteor of the northern sky! And high through darkness rears his giant-form, His throne the billow, and his flag the storm! Yet then, when bloom and sunshine are no more, And the wild surges foam along the shore; Domestic Bliss, thy heaven is still serene, Thy star unclouded, and thy myrtle green! Thy fane of rest no raging storms invade, Sweet peace is thine, the seraph of the shade! Clear through the day, her light around thee glows, And gilds the midnight of thy deep repose! —Hail, sacred Home! where soft Affection's hand, With flowers of Eden twines her magic band! Where pure and bright, the social ardours rise, Concentring all their holiest energies! When wasting toil has dimm'd the vital flame, And every power deserts the sinking frame; Exhausted nature still from sleep implores The charm that lulls, the manna that restores! Thus, when oppress'd with rude, tumultuous cares, To thee, sweet Home! the fainting mind repairs; Still to thy breast, a wearied pilgrim, flies, Her ark of refuge from uncertain skies! Bower of repose! when torn from all we love, Through toil we struggle, or through distance rove; To thee we turn, still faithful, from afar, Thee, our bright vista! thee, our magnet-star! And from the martial field, the troubled sea, Unfetter'd thought still roves to bliss and thee! When ocean-sounds in awful slumber die, No wave to murmur, and no gale to sigh; Wide o'er the world, when Peace and Midnight reign, And the moon trembles on the sleeping main; At that still hour, the sailor wakes to keep, 'Midst the dead calm, the vigil of the deep! No gleaming shores his dim horizon bound, All heaven—and sea—and solitude—around! Then, from the lonely deck, the silent helm, From the wide grandeur of the shadowy realm; Still homeward borne, his fancy unconfined, Leaving the worlds of ocean far behind, Wings like a meteor-flash her swift career, To the loved scene, so distant, and so dear! Lo! the rude whirlwind rushes from its cave, And Danger frowns—the monarch of the wave! Lo! rocks and storms the striving bark repel, And Death and Shipwreck ride the foaming swell! Child of the ocean! is thy bier the surge, Thy grave the billow, and the wind thy dirge? Yes! thy long toils, thy weary conflict's o'er, No storm shall wake, no perils rouse thee more! Yet, in that solemn hour, that awful strife, The struggling agony for death or life; E'en then thy mind, embitt'ring every pain, Retraced the image so beloved—in vain! Still to sweet Home, thy last regrets were true, Life's parting sigh—the murmur of adieu! Can war's dread scenes the hallowed ties efface, Each tender thought, each fond remembrance chase? Can fields of carnage, days of toil, destroy The loved impression of domestic joy? Ye daylight dreams! that cheer the soldier's breast, In hostile climes with spells benign and blest; Soothe his brave heart, and shed your glowing ray, O'er the long march, through Desolation's way; Oh! still ye bear him from th' ensanguin'd plain, Armour's bright flash, and Victory's choral strain; To that loved Home, where pure affection glows, That shrine of bliss! asylum of repose! When all is hush'd—the rage of combat past, And no dread war-note swells the moaning blast; When the warm throb of many a heart is o'er, And many an eye is closed to wake no more; Lull'd by the night-wind, pillow'd on the ground, (The dewy deathbed of his comrades round!) While o'er the slain the tears of midnight weep, Faint with fatigue, he sinks in slumbers deep! E'en then, soft visions, hov'ring round, portray, The cherish'd forms that o'er his bosom sway; He sees fond transport light each beaming face, Meets the warm tear-drop, and the long embrace! While the sweet welcome vibrates through his heart, “Hail, weary soldier!—never more to part!” And lo! at last, released from every toil, He comes!—the wanderer views his native soil! Then the bright raptures words can never speak, Flash in his eye, and mantle o'er his cheek! Then Love and Friendship, whose unceasing prayer, Implored for him, each guardian-spirit's care; Who, for his fate, through sorrow's ling'ring year, Had proved each thrilling pulse of hope and fear; In that blest moment, all the past forget— Hours of suspense, and vigils of regret! And, oh! for him, the child of rude alarms, Rear'd by stern danger in the school of arms; How sweet to change the war-song's pealing note, For woodland-sounds, in summer-air that float! Through vales of peace, o'er mountain wilds to roam, And breathe his native gales, that whisper—“Home!” Hail sweet endearments of domestic ties, Charms of existence! angel sympathies! Though Pleasure smile, a soft Circassian queen! And guide her votaries through a fairy scene, Where sylphid forms beguile their vernal hours, With mirth and music, in Arcadian bowers; Though gazing nations hail the fiery car That bears the Son of Conquest from afar; While Fame's loud pæan bids his heart rejoice, And every life pulse vibrates to her voice;— Yet from your source, alone, in mazes bright, Flows the full current of serene delight! On Freedom's wing, that every wild explores, Through realms of space, th' aspiring eagle soars! Darts o'er the clouds, exulting to admire, Meridian glory—on her throne of fire! Bird of the Sun! his keen unwearied gaze, Hails the full moon, and triumphs in the blaze; But soon, descending from his height sublime, Day's burning fount, and light's empyreal clime; Once more he speeds to joys more calmly blest, 'Midst the dear inmates of his lonely nest! Thus Genius, mounting on his bright career, Through the wide regions of the mental sphere; And proudly waving, in his gifted hand, O'er Fancy's worlds, Invention's plastic wand; Fearless and firm, with lightning-eye surveys The clearest heaven of intellectual rays! Yet, on his course though loftiest hopes attend, And kindling raptures aid him to ascend; (While in his mind, with high-born grandeur fraught, Dilate the noblest energies of thought;) Still, from the bliss, ethereal and refined, Which crowns the soarings of triumphant mind, At length he flies, to that serene retreat, Where calm and pure, the mild affections meet; Embosom'd there, to feel and to impart The softer pleasures of the social heart! Ah! weep for those, deserted and forlorn, From every tie, by fate relentless torn; See, on the barren coast, the lonely isle, Mark'd with no step, uncheer'd by human smile, Heart-sick and faint the shipwreck'd wanderer stand, Raise the dim eye, and lift the suppliant hand! Explore with fruitless gaze the billowy main, And weep—and pray—and linger—but in vain! Thence, roving wild through many a depth of shade, Where voice ne'er echo'd, footstep never stray'd; He fondly seeks, o'er cliffs and deserts rude, Haunts of mankind, 'midst realms of solitude! And pauses oft, and sadly hears alone, The wood's deep sigh, the surge's distant moan! All else is hush'd! so silent, so profound, As if some viewless power, presiding round, With mystic spell, unbroken by a breath, Had spread for ages the repose of death! Ah! still the wanderer, by the boundless deep, Lives but to watch—and watches but to weep! He sees no sail in faint perspective rise, His the dread loneliness of sea and skies! Far from his cherish'd friends, his native shore, Banish'd from being—to return no more; There must he die!—within that circling wave, That lonely isle—his prison and his grave! Lo! through the waste, the wilderness of snows, With fainting step, Siberia's exile goes! Homeless and sad, o'er many a polar wild, Where beam, or flower, or verdure never smiled; Where frost and silence hold their despot-reign, And bind existence in eternal chain! Child of the desert! pilgrim of the gloom! Dark is the path which leads thee to the tomb! While on thy faded cheek, the arctic air, Congeals the bitter tear-drop of despair! Yet not that fate condemns thy closing day, In that stern clime, to shed its parting ray; Not that fair nature's loveliness and light No more shall beam enchantment on thy sight; Ah! not for this, far, far beyond relief, Deep in thy bosom dwells the hopeless grief; But that no friend of kindred heart is there, Thy woes to mitigate, thy toils to share; That no mild soother fondly shall assuage The stormy trials of thy ling'ring age; No smile of tenderness, with angel power, Lull the dread pangs of dissolution's hour; For this alone, despair, a withering guest Sits on thy brow, and cankers in thy breast! Yes! there, e'en there, in that tremendous clime, Where desert grandeur frowns, in pomp sublime; Where winter triumphs, through the polar night, In all his wild magnificence of might; E'en there, affection's hallow'd spell might pour The light of heaven around th' inclement shore! And, like the vales with gloom and sunshine graced, That smile, by circling Pyrenees embraced, Teach the pure heart, with vital fires to glow, E'en 'midst the world of solitude and snow! The halcyon's charm, thus dreaming fictions feign, With mystic power, could tranquillize the main; Bid the loud wind, the mountain billow sleep, And peace and silence brood upon the deep! And thus, Affection, can thy voice compose The stormy tide of passions and of woes; Bid every throb of wild emotion cease, And lull misfortune in the arms of peace! Oh! mark yon drooping form, of aged mien, Wan, yet resign'd, and hopeless, yet serene! Long ere victorious time had sought to chase, The bloom, the smile, that once illumed his face; That faded eye was dimm'd with many a care, Those waving locks were silver'd by despair! Yet filial love can pour the sovereign balm, Assuage his pangs, his wounded spirit calm! He, a sad emigrant! condemn'd to roam, In life's pale autumn from his ruin'd home; Has borne the shock of Peril's darkest wave, Where joy—and hope—and fortune—found a grave! 'Twas his, to see Destruction's fiercest band, Rush, like a Typhon, on his native land, And roll, triumphant, on their blasted way, In fire and blood—the deluge of dismay! Unequal combat raged on many a plain, And patriot-valour waved the sword in vain! Ah! gallant exile! nobly, long, he bled, Long braved the tempest gath'ring o'er his head! Till all was lost! and horror's darken'd eye, Roused the stern spirit of despair to die! Ah! gallant exile! in the storm that roll'd Far o'er his country, rushing uncontroll'd; The flowers that graced his path with loveliest bloom, Torn by the blast—were scatter'd on the tomb! When carnage burst, exulting in the strife, The bosom ties that bound his soul to life; Yet one was spared! and she, whose filial smile, Can sooth his wanderings, and his tears beguile; E'en then, could temper, with divine relief, The wild delirium of unbounded grief; And whisp'ring peace, conceal, with duteous art, Her own deep sorrows in her inmost heart! And now, though time, subduing every trace, Has mellow'd all, he never can erase; Oft will the wanderer's tears in silence flow, Still sadly faithful to remember'd woe! Then she, who feels a father's pang alone, (Still fondly struggling to suppress her own,) With anxious tenderness is ever nigh, To chase the image that awakes the sigh! Her angel-voice his fainting soul can raise, To brighter visions of celestial days! And speak of realms, where Virtue's wing shall soar On eagle-plume—to wonder and adore; And Friends, divided here, shall meet at last, Unite their kindred souls—and smile on all the past! Yes! we may hope, that nature's deathless ties, Renew'd, refined—shall triumph in the skies! Heart-soothing thought! whose loved, consoling powers With seraph-dreams can gild reflection's hours, Oh! still be near, and bright'ning through the gloom, Beam and ascend! the day-star of the tomb! And smile for those, in sternest ordeals proved, Those lonely hearts, bereft of all they loved. Lo! by the couch where pain and chill disease, In every vein, the ebbing life-blood freeze; Where youth is taught, by stealing, slow decay, Life's closing lesson—in its dawning day; Where beauty's rose is with'ring ere its prime, Unchanged by sorrow—and unsoil'd by time; There, bending still, with fix'd and sleepless eye, There, from her child, the mother learns to die; Explores, with fearful gaze, each mournful trace, Of ling'ring sickness in the faded face; Through the sad night, when every hope is fled, Keeps her lone vigil by the sufferer's bed; And starts each morn, as deeper marks declare The spoiler's hand—the blight of death, is there! He comes! now feebly in the exhausted frame, Slow, languid, quivering, burns the vital flame; From the glazed eye-ball sheds its parting ray, Dim, transient spark, that fluttering, fades away! Faint beats the hov'ring pulse, the trembling heart; Yet fond existence lingers ere she part! 'Tis past, the struggle and the pang are o'er, And life shall throb with agony no more; While o'er the wasted form, the features pale, Death's awful shadows throw their silvery veil: Departed spirit! on this earthly sphere, Though poignant suff'ring mark'd thy short career; Still could maternal love beguile thy woes, And hush thy sighs—an angel of repose! But who may charm her sleepless pang to rest, Or draw the thorn that rankles in her breast? And, while she bends in silence o'er thy bier, Assuage the grief, too heart-sick for a tear? Visions of hope, in loveliest hues array'd, Fair scenes of bliss! by fancy's hand portray'd; And were ye doom'd with false, illusive smile, With flatt'ring promise, to enchant awhile? And are ye vanish'd, never to return, Set in the darkness of the mould'ring urn? Will no bright hour departed joys restore? Shall the sad parent meet her child no more? Behold no more the soul-illumined face, The expressive smile, the animated grace? Must the fair blossom, wither'd in the tomb, Revive no more in loveliness and bloom? Descend, blest faith! dispel the hopeless care, And chase the gath'ring phantoms of despair; Tell, that the flower, transplanted in its morn, Enjoys bright Eden, freed from every thorn; Expands to milder suns, and softer dews, The full perfection of immortal hues; Tell, that when mounting to her native skies, By death released, the parent spirit flies; There shall the child, in anguish mourn'd so long, With rapture hail her, 'midst the cherub throng; And guide her pinion, on exulting flight, Through glory's boundless realms, and worlds of living light. Ye gentle spirits of departed friends! If e'er on earth your buoyant wing descends; If, with benignant care, ye linger near, To guard the objects in existence dear; If hov'ring o'er, ethereal band! ye view The tender sorrows, to your memory true; Oh! in the musing hour, at midnight deep, While for your loss affection wakes to weep; While every sound in hallow'd stillness lies, But the low murmur of her plaintive sighs; Oh! then, amidst that holy calm be near, Breathe your light whisper softly in her ear; With secret spells, her wounded mind compose, And chase the faithful tear—for you that flows; Be near; when moonlight spreads the charm you loved, O'er scenes where once your earthly footstep roved; Then, while she wanders o'er the sparkling dew, Through glens and wood-paths, once endear'd by you, And fondly lingers in your fav'rite bowers, And pauses oft, recalling former hours; Then wave your pinion o'er each well-known vale, Float in the moonbeam, sigh upon the gale; Bid your wild symphonies remotely swell, Borne by the summer-wind from grot and dell; And touch your viewless harps, and sooth her soul, With soft enchantments and divine control! Be near, sweet guardians; watch her sacred rest, When Slumber folds her in his magic vest; Around her, smiling, let your forms arise, Return'd in dreams, to bless her mental eyes; Efface the mem'ry of your last farewell, Of glowing joys, of radiant prospects tell; The sweet communion of the past renew, Reviving former scenes, array'd in softer hue. Be near when death, in virtue's brightest hour, Calls up each pang, and summons all his power; Oh! then, transcending Fancy's loveliest dream, Then let your forms unveil'd, around her beam; Then waft the vision of unclouded light, A burst of glory, on her closing sight; Wake from the harp of heaven th' immortal strain, To hush the final agonies of pain; With rapture's flame, the parting soul illume, And smile triumphant through the shadowy gloom! Oh! still be near, when, darting into day, Th' exulting spirit leaves her bonds of clay; Be yours to guide her flutt'ring wings on high, O'er many a world, ascending to the sky; There let your presence, once her earthly joy, Though dimm'd with tears, and clouded with alloy, Now form her bliss on that celestial shore, Where death shall sever kindred hearts no more. Yes! in the noon of that Elysian clime Beyond the sphere of anguish, death or time; Where mind's bright eye, with renovated fire, Shall beam on glories—never to expire; Oh! there th' illumined soul may fondly trust, More pure, more perfect, rising from the dust, Those mild affections, whose consoling light Sheds the soft moonbeam on terrestrial night, Sublimed, ennobled, shall for ever glow, Exalting rapture—not assuaging woe!
