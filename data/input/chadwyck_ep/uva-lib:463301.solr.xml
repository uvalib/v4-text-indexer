POEMS ACCEPTED AS HARINGTON'S BY THE EDITOR II A 1 [Yf Ryght be rakt and over Roon] Yf Ryght be rakt and over Roon and power tak part with open wrong yf fear by force yeld up to soon my lacke ys lyke to last to longe yf god for goodes shalbe unplact yf Ryt for Ryches loose shapp yf world for wysdome be embract the gesse is great muche hourt may happ Emongst good thynges I prove and fynd the quyet lief dothe muche habownd and sure to the contented mynd ther is no Ryches may be fownd For Ryches hates to be content Rewll is enyme to quyetnes Power for most part is impassyent and seldome lykes to lyve in pease I hard an herdman once compare that quyet nyghtes he had mo slept and had moe mery days to spare then he whyche awght the bestes he kept I wold not have yt thoght here by the dolphyn swyme I mean to teache nor yet to lern the facon fly I Rove not so farr past my Reche but as my part a bove the Rest is well to wyn and good to wyll so tyll my brethe shall fayll my breste I wyll not stay to wyshe you styll II A 2 [degrese of lyghtnes lefte behynde] degrese of lyghtnes lefte behynde to teache us know lyght things of kynde lyghter then fume flame is assynde lyghter then flame they wryt the wynde lyghter then wynd a womans mynde lyghter then that no thyng the fynde II A 3 [he that spares to speak hathe hardly his entent] he that spares to speak hathe hardly his entent he that speaks and speeds his speakyng is nott spent he that speaks and speeds not. his spekyng is but lost and yet speakyng wythe owt speedyng is but a small cost II A 4 [None can deeme righte, whoe Faithfull freendes do rest] None can deeme righte, whoe Faithfull freendes do rest whilste they doe Rule, and Raigne in great degree For than bothe faste, and fained freendes are preste Whose faithes seeme bothe, of one effect to bee But if that welthe unwynde and fortune flee as never knowen revoltes th'unfaithfull gheste but he whose hart, in life once faithe linckt faste Will love and serve, even after deathe is paste II A 5 [Such one is ware by what degrees he clymes] Such one is ware by what degrees he clymes, Rather pleasant then proud in high estate, Rather bold then abasht in lowring times, And can in both so well uphold his state, As many would but few can do or none, Of which few sort, I wish your Lordship one. II A 6 [Who justly may rejoyce in ought under the skye?] Who justly may rejoyce in ought under the skye? As life, or lands: as frends, or frutes: which only live to dye. Or who dothe not well know all worldly works are vaine? And geveth nought but to the lendes, to take the same againe. For though it lift some up: as wee long upward all: Such is the sort of slipper welth: all things do rise to fall. Thuncertentie is such: experience teacheth so: That what things men do covet most, them sonest they forgo. Lo Devorox where he lieth: whose life men heeld so deare That now his death is sorowed so, that pitie it is to heare. His birth of auncient blood: his parents of great fame: And yet in vertue farre before the formost of the same. His king, and countrye bothe he served to so great gaine: That with the Brutes record doth rest, and ever shall remaine. No man in warre so mete, an enterprise to take: No man in peace that pleasurd more of enmies frends to make. A Cato for his counsell: his head was surely such. Ne Theseus frenship was so great, but Devorox was as much. A graffe of so small grothe so much good frute to bring: Is seldome heard, or never sene: it is so rare a thing. A man sent us from God, his life did well declare: And now sent for by god again, to teach us what we are. Death, and the grave, that shall accompany all that live, Hath brought him heven, though somewhat sone, which life could never geve God graunt well all, that shall professe as he profest: To live so well, to dye no worse: and send his soule good rest. II A 7 [At least withdraw your creweltie] At least withdraw your creweltie or force the tyme to worke your will Yt is to moche extreamytie to kepe me pent in pryson styll free from all fawte voyd of all cawse without all right agaynst all lawse how can you use more crewell spight than offre wrong and promes right yet can not accuse nor will acquyght A Leven months full and longer space I have endured your deavellishe dryftes whylest you have sought bothe man and place and sett your snares with all your shyftes the fawtlesse foote to wrapp with wyle in any guylt by any guyle and now you see it will not be how can you thus for shame agree to kepe hym bownd you ought sett free Your chaunce was once as myne is now to kepe this hold agaynst your will and than you sware you know well how though now you swarve I know how yll but thus the world his course doth passe the priest forgeates that Clerk he was and you that then cryed Justyce styll and now have Justyce att your will Wrest Justyce wrong agaynst all skill But whye do I thus coldly playne as thoughe it were my cawse alone whan cawse doth eache man so constrayne as Englond through hath cawse to mone to see your blooddy searche of suche as all the earth can no way towche and better weare that all your kynd Lyke hownds in hell with shame were shrynd then you had might unto your mynd But as the Stone that strykes the wall Somtyme bownds back on th'urlers hedd so your fowle fetche to your fowle fall may tourne and noye the brest it bredd and than suche measure as you gave of right and Justice looke to have yf good or yll, yf short or longe yf falce or trew, yf right or wronge And thus tyll than I end my songe II A 8 [Heer lye the bones of busy Gardiner dead] Heer lye the bones of busy Gardiner dead that in five yeares spoild more good lawes and lore then two great Kings with all the wittes they bred Could stablish sure in forty yeares before The Queen beguild, the Lordes like lymehoundes led, The usurping rule of Rome he did restore Burne, head, and hang, imprison, vex and spoile the worthie sort of this declying Soile. II A 9 [In doing well use no delay] In doing well use no delay For in short space, tyme wears away. II A 10 A sonet written upon my Lord Admirall Seymour./ Of person Rare, Stronge Lymbes, and manly shapp of nature fram'de to sarve on Sea or lande of frendship firme in good state and ill happ In peace head wise, in warr skill great, bolde hande on horse on foote, in peryll or in playe None coulde excell thoughe many did assaie A Subject true to Kinge, and servant great Freend to goddes truthe en'mye to Roomes disceat Somtuous abroad, for honor of the lande Temp'rat at home; yet kept great state with staie And noble house; and gave moe mowthes more meat then some advaunste on higher stepps to stande/ Yet against Nature Reason and just Lawes His blood was spilt, guiltles without just cause/ II A 11 John Harington to his Mother, 1540. There was a battaill fought of late, Yet was the slaughter small; The strife was, whether I shulde wright, Or send nothing at all. Of one syde were the Captaynes names Short Tyme and Lytle Skill; One fought alone agaynst them bothe, Whose name was Great Good-will. Short Tyme enforst me in a straite, And bad me holde my hand; Small Skill also withstoode desyre, My wryting to withstand. But Great Good-will, in shew though small, To wright encourag'de me, And to the battaile helde on still, No common thinge to see. Thus gan theise busye warriours three Betwene themselves to fight As valiauntlye as though they had Bene of much greater might. Till Fortune, that unconstant dame, Which rules soche things allwaye, Did cause the weaker parte in fight To bear the greatter swaye: And then the victour caused me, However was my skill, To wright theise vearses unto you, To shew my great good-will. II A 12 A sonnet made on Isabella Markhame, when I firste thought her fayer as she stood at the Princess's Windowe in goodlye Attyre, and talkede to dyvers in the Courte-Yard. Whence comes my love, O hearte, disclose, 'Twas from cheeks that shamed the rose; From lips that spoyle the rubies prayse; From eyes that mock the diamond's blaze. Whence comes my woe, as freely owne, Ah me! 'twas from a hearte lyke stone. The blushyne cheek speakes modest mynde, The lipps befitting wordes moste kynde; The eye does tempte to love's desyre, And seems to say, 'tis Cupid's fire; Yet all so faire, but speake my moane, Syth noughte dothe saye the hearte of stone. Why thus, my love, so kynde bespeake, Sweet lyppe, sweet eye, sweet blushynge cheeke, Yet not a hearte to save my paine, O Venus, take thy giftes again; Make not so faire to cause our moane, Or make a hearte that's lyke our owne. II A 13 [Alas! I love yow overwell] Question. Alas! I love yow overwell, Myne owne sweete deere delygte; Yet, for respects, I feare to tell What moves my trobled spryghte: What workes my woe, what breedes my smarte, What woundes myn harte and mynde, Reason restrayns me to emparte Such perylls as I fynde. Answer. If present peryll reason fynde, And hope for helpe doe haste; Unfolde the secretts of yowr mynde, Whyls hope of helpe may taste. And I will ease yowr payne and smarte, As yf yt weare myne owne; Respects and perylls put aparte, And let the truthe be knowne. Question. The words be sownde, the sownde ys sweete, The sweete yeeldes bounty free; Noe wyghte hathe worthe to yeelde meed meete For grace of suche degree: Now, sythe my playnte dothe pytie move, Grawnt grace that I may taste Suche joys as angells feele above, That lovingly may last. Answer. I yeeld with harte and wylling mynde To doe all yow desyre; Doubtinge noe deale suche faythe to fynde As suche truste dothe requier: Now yow have wealthe at yowr owne will, And lawe at yowr owne luste, To make or mar, to save or spill; Then be a Conquerour juste. Answer. Fyrste shall the sunne in darknes dwell, The moone and starrs lacke lyghte, Before in thoughte I doe rebell Agaynste my lyves delyghte: Tryed ys my truste, knowne ys my truthe, Yn tyme, my sweete, provyde, Whilest bewtie florishe in thine yowthe, And brethe in mee abyde. II A 14 [Lyke as the rage of rayne] Lyke as the rage of rayne Fills ryvers with excesse; And as the drowght agayne Doth draw them lesse and lesse; So I both fall and clyme, With no and yea somtyme. As they ryse hye and hye, So doth encreace my state; As they fall drye and drye, So doth my wealth abate: As yea ys matcht with no, My wealth ys myxt with wo. As nothing can endure, That lyves and lacks relief; So no state may stand sure, Where chaunge doth rayne as Chief: Wherefore I must entend To bow, when others bend. And, when they laugh, to smyle, And, when they weepe, to wayle; And, when they crafte, begyle, And, when they fight, assayle: And thynck there ys no chaunge Can make them seeme to straunge.

[O Happy dames, that may embrace] O Happy dames, that may embrace The frute of your delight, Help to bewaile the wofull case, And eke the heavy plight Of me, that wonted to rejoyce The fortune of my pleasant choyce: Good Ladies, help to fill my moorning voyce. In ship, freight with rememberance Of thoughts, and pleasures past, He sailes that hath in governance My life, while it wil last: With scalding sighes, for lack of gale, Furdering his hope, that is his sail Toward me, the swete port of his avail. Alas, how oft in dreames I se Those eyes, that were my food, Which somtime so delited me, That yet they do me good. Wherwith I wake with his returne, Whose absent flame did make me burne. But when I find the lacke, Lord how I mourne? When other lovers in armes acrosse, Rejoyce their chiefe delight: Drowned in teares to mourne my losse, I stand the bitter night, In my window, where I may see, Before the windes how the cloudes flee. Lo, what a mariner love hath made me. And in grene waves when the salt flood Doth rise, by rage of winde: A thousand fansies in that mood Assayle my restlesse mind. Alas, now drencheth my swete fo, That with the spoyle of my hart did go, And left me but (alas) why did he so? And when the seas waxe calme againe, To chase fro me annoye. My doubtfull hope doth cause me plaine: So dreade cuts of my joye. Thus is my wealth mingled with wo, And of ech thought a dout doth growe, Now he comes, will he come? alas, no no. II B 5The attribution of this poem is questionable. [Erst in Arcadia's londe much prais'd was found] Erst in Arcadia's londe much prais'd was found A lustie tree far rearing t'ward the skie, Sacred to Jove, and placed on high grounde, Beneath whose shade did gladsome shepherds hie, Met plenteous good, and oft were wont to shunne Bleak winters drizzle, summers parching sunne. Outstretch'd in all the luxurie of ease, They pluck'd rich mistletoe of virtue rare; Their lippe was temptede by each kindlie breeze, That wav'd the branch to proffer acorns fair; While out the hollowd root, with sweets inlaide, The murm'ring bee her daintie hoard betrayde. The fearless bird safe bosom'd here its neste, Its sturdie side did brave the nipping winde, Where many a creeping ewe mought gladlie reste Warme comforte here to all and ev'ry kinde Where hunge the leaf well sprint with honey dew, Whence dropt their cups, the gamboling fairie knew. But ah! in luckless day what mischief 'gan 'Midst fell debate, and madd'ning revelrie, When tipsie Bacchus had bewitched Pan, For sober swains so thankless neer mought be; Tho' passinge strangeâ'twas bruited all arounde, This goodlie tree did shadowe too much grounde. With much despight they aim its overthrow, And sorrie jestes its wonted giftes deride, How 'snaring birdlimes made of mistletoe; Nor trust their flocks to shelter 'neath its side; It drops chill venom on our ewes, they cry, And subtle serpent at its root doth lie. Eftsoons the axe doth rear its deadlie blowe, Arounde dothe eccho bear each labouringe stroke; Now to the grounde its loftie head doth bowe, Then angry Jove aloud in thunder spoke, On high Olympus next mine tree I'll place, Heav'n's still unscann'd by sich ungrateful race.</field>
