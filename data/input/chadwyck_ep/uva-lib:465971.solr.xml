      <field name="fulltext">BLIND MATTHEW. First appeared in the Quiver, and taken from that Magazine by kind permission of Messrs. Cassell, Petter, &amp; Galpin. Blind Matthew, coming down the village street With slow, sure footsteps, pauses for a while, And in the sunlight falling soft and sweet His features brighten to a kindly smile. Upon his ear the sounds of toil and gain, Clanking from wood-girt shop and smithy, steal, And soft he whispers, âO my fellow-men, I cannot see you, but I hear and feel.â Then smiling still he slowly steps along, And every kindly word and friendly tone, Like the old fragment of an early song, Wakes thoughts that make the past again his own. The children see him, and in merry band Come shouting from their glad and healthy play, âHere is blind Matthew, let us take his hand, And see if he can guess our names to-day.â Then all around him throng, and run, and press, And lead him to his seat beneath the tree, Each striving to be first, for his caress, Or gain the favour'd seat upon his knee. And Matthew, happy in their artless prate, Cries, as he slips into their guileless plan, âNow she who holds my right hand is sweet Kate, And she who holds my left is little Anne.â Then all the children leap with joyful cries, Till one fair prattler nestling on his breast Whispers, âBlind Matthew, tell us when your eyes Shall have their light, and open like the rest?â Then closer still he draws the little one, Laying his hand upon her golden head; Then speaks with low, soft, sweet and solemn tone, While all the rest range round with quiet tread. He tells how Christ, in ages long ago, Came down to earth in human shape and name, Walking his pilgrimage, begirt with woe, And laying healing hands on blind and lame. Then of blind Bartimeus, the beggar, he Who by the wayside sat, and cried in awe, âJesus, thou Son of David, look on me;â And Jesus look'd and touch'd him, and he saw. âBut not on earth these eyes of mine shall fill With light,â thus Matthew ends, âfor in this night I must grope on with Christ to guide me still, And He will lead me through the grave to light. âSo when you miss old Matthew from the street, And in the quiet of the churchyard lies A new-made grave, to draw your timid feet, Then will you know that Christ has touch'd my eyes.â ADA. Lying full-length upon the summer grass, And by the murmur of a summer stream, I heard the village bell, and turning round To him who sat beside me with his feet Touching the ripple of the brook, I said, âWho sinks into the churchyard rest to-day?â Then he, half lifting up his earnest face, Paused for a little while, and then repliedâ âAda, whose beauty was a fairy thing, But brighter now by Death, whose pencil tints His marks with such sweet colours.â Then he sunk Into that dreamy reverie which shuts All thought from out its vision, and so thinks, And thinks, and thinks, and yet thinks naught at all; But I, half-answer'd, could but ill abide His silentness, and so I question'd still: âBut who is Ada? you have never said; And there you dream, and think, and all the while The tolling of the bell within my ear, And yet I know not unto whom it offers Such sweet and stirless rest.â Then starting up From all his fit of mute philosophy He said, âWhy, surely you have not forgot Ada, who flash'd upon you like a star Three months ago, when you were in the woods. At your old rambles, and she knew it not, But pass'd you in her beauty by, and you Fell half in love with her and writ a song?â Then all at once came, like remember'd dreams, The solitude around the woodland walk, And all the fringing of the idle rhyme (Now something better by the help of Death), Which I had made in haste, and sung to him A half-hour after. âNow, what better time Than this,â I cried, âto sing that song again, When she is passing from all mortal view Into the shady quietness.â And he, Catching the broader finish of the plan, Said, âLet the song be sung, but make a pause Between each stanza, that the bell may chime Its echoes at the finish of each verse, And let your poet's fancy shape the wordsâ So, with the humming idyll of the brook As an accompaniment I sang the song: Ada came down by the path in the wood, In the flush and the warmth of the day, And the spirits that live in the solitude (For there be such they say) Came out from their haunts by tree and brook, And wherever sunbeams play, To gaze, as she pass'd like a bud on the lakeâ A sweet Diana of earthly makeâ In the clasp of the amorous day. I ceased, and the sad bell took up the pause, And sang an answer to its solemn chime: Ada walks no earthly path, Other things are hers this hour She has all an angel hathâ Glory and celestial power; Nought may look on her but eyes Purged from aught of mortal sight, As she walks in balmy light In the halls of Paradise. So the dust may shrink, but she Through the years, in the spheres, Is one great type of immortality. So sang the bell, and when its echo died I took my part in turn, and sang again: I was out in the wood when she pass'd me by, Half-hid that she could not see, So a woman's wish was in her eye, And a smile that made me, I know not why, Guess and dream that she Was far away in the golden hope Of the coming time, and the novel scope Of wifehood, and the prattling bliss Of little lips, and this, and this Was the light and colour within her eye, And the smile as she pass'd me by. THE ENGINE. âOn fire-horses and wind-horses we career.â âCarlyle. Hurrah! for the mighty engine, As he bounds along his track: Hurrah, for the life that is in him, And his breath so thick and black. And hurrah for our fellows, who in their need Could fashion a thing like himâ With a heart of fire, and a soul of steel, And a Samson in every limb. Ho! stand from that narrow path of his, Lest his gleaming muscles smite, Like the flaming sword the archangel drew When Eden lay wrapp'd in night; For he cares, not he, for a paltry life As he rushes along to the goal, It but costs him a shake of his iron limb, And a shriek from his mighty soul. Yet I glory to think that I help to keep His footsteps a little in place, And he thunders his thanks as he rushes on In the lightning speed of his race; And I think that he knows when he looks at me, That, though made of clay as I stand, I could make him as weak as a three hours' child With a paltry twitch of my hand. But I trust in his strength, and he trusts in me, Though made but of brittle clay, While he is bound up in the toughest of steel, That tires not night or day; But for ever flashes, and stretches, and strives, While he shrieks in his smoky gleeâ Hurrah for the puppets that, lost in their thoughts, Could rub the lamp for me! O that some Romanâwhen Rome was greatâ Some quick, light Greek or twoâ Could come from their graves for one half-hour To see what my fellows can do; I would take them with me on this world's wild steed, And give him a little rein; Then rush with his clanking hoofs through space, With a wreath of smoke for his mane. I would say to them as they shook in their fear, âNow what is your paltry book, Or the Phidian touch of the chisel's point, That can make the marble look, To this monster of ours, that for ages lay In the depths of the dreaming earth, Till we brought him out with a cheer and a shout, And hammer'd him into birth?â Clank, clank went the hammer in dusty shops, The forge-flare went to the sky, While still, like the monster of Frankenstein's, This great wild being was nigh; Till at length he rose up in his sinew and strength, And our fellows could see with pride Their grimy brows and their bare, slight arms, In the depths of his glancing side. Then there rose to their lips a dread question of fearâ âWho has in him the nerve to start In this mass a soul that will shake and roll A river of life to his heart?â Then a pigmy by jerks went up his side, Flung a globe of fire in his breast, And cities leapt nearer by hundreds of miles At the first wild snort from his chest. Then away he rush'd to his mission of toil, Wherever lay guiding rods, And the work he could do at each throb of his pulse Flung a blush on the face of the gods. And Atlas himself, when he felt his weight, Bent lower his quaking limb, Then shook himself free from this earth, and left The grand old planet to him. But well can he bear it, this Titan of toil, When his pathway yields to his tread; And the vigour within him flares up to its height, Till the smoke of his breath grows red; Then he shrieks in delight, as an athlete might, When he reaches his wild desire, And from head to heel, through each muscle of steel, Runs the cunning and clasp of the fire. Or, see how he tosses aside the night, And roars in his thirsty wrath, While his one great eye gleams white with rage At the darkness that muffles his path; And lo! as the pent-up flame of his heart Flashes out from behind its bars, It gleams like a bolt flung from heaven, and rears A ladder of light to the stars. Talk of the sea flung back in its wrath By a line of unyielding stone, Or the slender clutch of a thread-like bridge, That knits two valleys in one! Talk of your miracle-working wires, And their world-embracing force, But himmel! give me the bits of steel In the mouth of the thunder-horse! Ay, give me the beat of his fire-fed breast, And the shake of his giant frame, And the sinews that work like the shoulders of Jove When he launches a bolt of flame; And give me that Lilliput rider of his, Stout and wiry and grim, Who can vault on his back as he puffs his pipe, And whisk the breath from him. Then hurrah for our mighty engine, boys; He may roar and fume along For a hundred years ere a poet arise To shrine him in worthy song; Yet if one with the touch of the gods on his lips, And his heart beating wildly and quick, Should rush into song at this demon of ours, Let him sing, too, the shovel and pick. THE MOTHER AND THE ANGEL. First appeared in Good Words, and taken from that Magazine by kind permission of Messrs. Strahan &amp; Co. âI want my child,â the mother said, as through The deep sweet air of purple-breathing morn She rose mid clouds of most celestial hue, By the soft strength of angels' wings upborne. Then he who bore her to her heavenly rest Drew back the hand that hid her weeping eyes, And said, âI cannot alter the request Of him whose glory lights the earth and skies. For ere I came, and, as I paused again, To hear His omnipresent words, He said, âTake thou the root, but let the bud remain, To perfect into blossom in its stead.â And so I bear thee, that in our sweet land You may be one of our immortal kind, With not one task but to reach forth thy hand And guide the footsteps of thy child behind.â He ceased, and winging, reach'd those realms on high, Whose lustre we half see through stars below, And all the light that fills our earthly sky Is but a shadow to its mighty glow. Now whether that the mother in this light Stood yearning for her treasure in our hands, Or whether God saw fitting in His might To reunite again the broken bands We know not; but when night had come at last, And wore to clasp the first embrace of day, An angel enter'd, though the door was fast, And all unseen took what we held away. One took the mother from all earthly claim, From out the bounds of life and all its harms; But still I think 'twas God Himself that came, And took the child and laid it in her arms. THE SPIRIT OF THE WATERS. O how quick, and yet how soft Comes the moonlight from aloftâ From the happy starry skies, Like the smiles of angels' eyes, Flinging all the silvery whiteness Of its purity and brightness On the stream That dances up with laughter As the wavelets follow after Each other in the glee Of a pleasant symphony. I stand upon the bridge, Leaning on its narrow ledge, Keeping watch with dreaming eye On the river gliding by, Till I fancy from the deeps, Where the moonlight sits and sleeps, I can hear a whisper sayâ âCome away, come away, Come, and never know decay, Come, and rest beneath the stream, And for ever smile and dream. Through the night and sunny day, Dream of things with joyance rife, Dream of all that makes this life Bright and gay. While the waters ebb and creep With their murmurs o'er thy sleepâ While the moonlight from above Rains the pale wealth of her love On the wave, on thy graveâ Come away.â And I feel a strong desire Burning in me to inquire What this gentle sprite may be, Who sings such a song to me From the stream. For, as I hear his lay, Like a voice from far away, With its burden, âCome away,â I can reason thus how sweet To let all the waters meet O'er the weary, dreamy head; And to sink, as in a bed, In the tide, and there to lie All the night and watch the sky; Or sleep, sleep, sleep, While the breezes come and creepâ And what mortal would not sleep To such soothing lullaby, While the happy moon above Would fling down her wealth of love On the wave, on my grave, On my dream. NOTTMAN. That was Nottman waving at me, But the steam fell down, so you could not see; He is out to-day with the fast express, And running a mile in the minute, I guess. Danger? none in the least, for the way Is good, though the curves are sharp as you say, But bless you, when trains are a little behind, They thunder around themâa match for the wind. Nottman himself is a devil to drive, But cool and steady, and ever alive To whatever danger is looming in front, When a train has run hard to gain time for a shunt. But he once got a fear, though, that shook him with pain, Like sleepers beneath the weight of a train. I remember the story well, for, you see, His stoker, Jack Martin, told it to me. Nottman had sent down the wife for a change To the old folks living at Riverly Grange, A quiet sleepy sort of a town, Save when the engines went up and down. For close behind it the railway ran In a mile of a straight if a single span; Three bridges were over the straight, and between Two the distant signal was seen. She had with her her boyâa nice little chit Full of romp and mischief, and childish wit, And every time that we thunder'd by, Both were out on the watch for Nottman and I. âWell, one day,â said Jack, âon our journey down, Coming round on the straight at the back of the town, I saw right ahead, in front of our track, In the haze on the rail something dim-like and black. âI look'd over at Nottman, but ere I could speak, He shut off the steam, and with one wild shriek, A whistle took to the air with a bound; But the object ahead never stirr'd at the sound. âIn a moment he flung himself down on his knee, Leant over the side of the engine to see, Took one look, then sprung up, crying, breathless and pale, âBrake, Jack, it is some one asleep on the rail!â âThe rear brakes were whistled on in a trice While I screw'd on the tender brake firm as a vice, But still we tore on with this terrible thought Sending fear to our heartsââCan we stop her or not?â âI took one look again, then sung out to my mate, âWe can never draw up, we have seen it too late.â When, sudden and swift, like the change in a dream, Nottman drew back the lever, and flung on the steam. âThe great wheels stagger'd and span with the strain, While the spray from the steam fell around us like rain, But we slacken'd our speed, till we saw with a wild Throb at the heart, right before us,âa child! âIt was lying asleep on the rail, with no fear Of the terrible death that was looming so near; The sweat on us both broke as cold as the dew Of death as we question'dââWhat can we do? âIt was doneâswift as acts that take place in a dreamâ Nottman rush'd to the front and knelt down on the beam, Put one foot in the couplings; the other he kept Right in front of the wheel for the child that still slept. ââSaved!â I burst forth, my heart leaping with pride, For one touch of the foot sent the child to the side, But Nottman look'd up, his lips white as with foam, âMy God, Jack,â he cried, âIt's my own little Tom!â âHe shrunk, would have slipp'd, but one grasp of my hand, Held him firm till the engine was brought to a stand, Then I heard from behind a shriek take to the air, And I knew that the voice of a mother was there. âThe boy was all right, had got off with a scratch: He had crept through the fence in his frolic to watch For his father; but, wearied with mischief and play, Had fallen asleep on the rail where he lay. âFor days after that on our journey down, Ere we came to the straight at the back of the town, As if the signal were up with its gleam Of red, Nottman always shut off the steam.â SUMMER INVOCATION. Come forth, and bring with thee a mind That rises to the poet's mood; And leave the village far behind, And spend an hour within the wood; For there the flowers begin to peerâ Sweet primroses that ever seem The glowing eyes of the New Year Lit up with Summer and her dream. And violets that scarce are seen Until you stoop, with patient eye, And see them in their lowly mien, Blue droplets shaken from the sky. Come forth, so that thy soul again May talk a while with quiet things That living far apart from men, Have in them love's untamper'd springs. I heard the voiceâlike one who dreams I went forth, having in my breast A stirring quiet, like the streams When pausing for a little rest. I reach the wood, and all around The yearly mystery of birth Unfolds itself without a sound, And broadens over all the earth. The buds in virgin greenness burst And swell beneath the kindly skies All pure as when they grew at first, Upon the boughs in Paradise. The grass grows up, and in the wind Waves tiny fingers to and fro, As if distraught to probe and find The secret of its life below. I lay myself within the shade, I close my eyes, but in my ear Voices and many sounds invade, With whispers which I like to hear. For strange it is that as I lie, The wind, that leaves no footstep, seems The spirit of that melody Which gave my boyhood all its dreams. And as I listen, like a song Dear lips have sung in other years, There comes, with fragrance pure and strong, From pent-up sourcesâsweetest tears. I weep, and yet I know not why, For joy is hand in hand with pain; Perchance it is to think how dry Our hearts remain for all such rain. Or maybe of that other time, When youth uprising boldly said, âI will sow seed in noble prime,â Alas! and tears have grown instead. But still, as here I lie to-day, Seeing the new life quicken all, The old hard feeling slips away, And I am under softer thrall, I look, and from the slightest thing That God has fashion'd with His hand; New thoughts and meanings upward spring That are not hard to understand. And as I think and slowly slip Backward to all that early time, I feel a prayer upon my lip, And in my heart a holier rhyme, Until all freshen'd, as with dews That fall not from the sky above, But from some angel's eyes, I lose The old self in a nobler love. And I can look, as now I view The buds and grass, and singing birds, On men, and know their purpose too, And wed my thoughts to nobler words. I leave the wood all firm and bold, And whisper as through fields I passâ âDear Heaven, that heart is never old That takes an interest in the grassâ That hears in every lowly thing That spring has waken'd with her call A God-taught melody, that sings, And gives a key-note unto all.â SONNETS TO A PICTURE. âSatan watching the Sleep of Christ.ââSir Noel Paton. I. [He sleeps; the inner agony hath pass'd] He sleeps; the inner agony hath pass'd With the sure dawn that slowly climbs the east; The night wherein man saw Him not hath ceas'd, And sleep is on that glorious face at last. But pain still lingers there, though faint and worn, Upon the grandest of all brows, whereon It makes its latest stand to be o'erthrown, By the sunrise of Love's eternal morn. It is no painter's touch! beneath those eyes The mission and the Cross rise slowly up; Death with them with the dregs that He must sup, And sorrow with her choruses of sighs. And over all a halo from above, God's Signet on His Masterpiece of Love. II. [The splendid demon with the lurid eyes] The splendid demon with the lurid eyes, Wherein, as when a serpent bites its coil Nearing its deathâhate having felt its foil, Turns back upon itself before it dies. He sits; one massive evil, huge of limb, With hand still clench'd as with the wish to slay; While those dark brows for ever waste away With their own anger as they glare at Him. That beauty which repels nor draws us nigher Clothes him as with a raiment. We draw near, Drawn, yet held back as by instinctive fearâ As if a tongue from that dread crown of fire Could leap to meet us, like a stroke from fate, And blast us with the poison of its hate. III. [A Faust in colours with the good and ill] A Faust in colours with the good and ill For ever at their conflict, dumb of speech, Nor drawing gladiator-like to each, But armour'd in the panoply of will. The ages with their trailing shadows wait, And Time, the white field-marshal with keen eyes, Surveys the struggle, while the passive skies Bend and come nearer as if drawn by fate. Thou thinkest God has hid himself, but, lo! His awful shadow, or a part, at least, Of that which is His shadow, dawns to view In the young day, that, with its plumes aglow, All silently behind the silent Two Climbs the blue stair-way of the one-starr'd east. SONNETS TO A PICTURE. âMan with the Muck-rake.ââSir Noel Paton. I. [He kneels, his knee drawn down to kindred dust] He kneels, his knee drawn down to kindred dust, For all is earth within him, from those eyes Wherein a noble nature fallen lies, To the lean hands that clutch, as clutch they must, The muck-rake of this world, for unto him His heaven is on a level with his soul, That, blind, can see no higher, purer goal Than in the gold that glitters but to dim. Jewels that tarnish, honours that take wing A moment after, luring shapes that sink To leave the grinning skull whose sockets blink Derision sharper than the viper's sting, And Vanity, by hollow whispers nursed, Blowing her bubbles, which ere caught have burst. II. [Above him, yet he sees him not, there bends] Above him, yet he sees him not, there bends Compassion and Divinity in one, The Christ of time, earth, heaven and the sun, Of the soul's soul, and all that upward tends. In His right hand he holds a crown of thorns, Sorrow's own symbol, and the other lies Almost upon him, while behind him mourns His better angel with entreating eyes. Thou toiler after things that will not live! Look but once upward, that thy soul may see The sadden'd splendour of that glorious face, Then lift thyself against that hand, and give Thy better angel one sweet tear to place Within the very sight of God from thee. III. [Thou gazest and the picture fades away] Thou gazest and the picture fades away Like visions after sleep. But unto thee One thing remaineth which thou still canst see, Like midnight meteors when they flash astray. It is the woven crown of thorns, and lo, Behind it, on thy dim and awe-struck sight There rises up a cross of pale sad light That slowly deepens till its very glow Reaches thy inmost soul that, kneeling down Beneath a sorrow which all speech but mars, Sees, as a glory rises in the night, Through the rough circlet of the thorny crown Another issue forth that to the sight Becomes a blinding splendour thick with stars. THE RED LEAF. Have you so forgot the time, dear love, When we sat by the stream in the wood With our hearts as bright as the sky above, Talking as lovers should? And we whisper'd to each of that happy dayâ Looking forward is so sweetâ But still as the moments sped away The red leaf fell at our feet. The birds were out on the leafy boughs, Strong in their voice and youth, And between their songs we made our vows With a kiss to seal their truth; And I turn'd to you as I said, âThis streamââ The stream was then so sweetâ âHas music fit for our coming dream,â And the red leaf fell at our feet. The blushes lay warm on your gentle cheek, As I took your hand in mine, While your eyes they could not, would not speak Aught but that love of thine; And you smiled as I clasp'd and kiss'd you stillâ Your smile was then so sweetâ But ever between the joy and thrill The red leaf fell at our feet. I took the curls of your long, rich hair, And nursed them in my hand, As we laid in the future clear and fair, The dreams we both had plann'd; We had nothing to do with life's alloyâ O the heart will rise and beatâ But still as we spoke of our coming joy The read leaf fell at our feet. We stood by the gate as the virgin night Set her footsteps on the hill, Yet so sweet were your eyes with their dark rich light That I fondly linger'd still; But hours wait not whatever we doâ And lovers' hours are sweetâ So I kiss'd you again and said, âBe true,â And the red leaf lay at our feet. Now I walk this life with a solemn brow, For the sweetest of hopes is fled, And the blossoms that once would burst and blow Are now for ever dead. Yet I smile as they question âWhy is this?ââ O the pain of the inward heat!â And seem to be gay as I laugh and say, The red leaf fell at our feet. HE CAME FROM A LAND. He came from a land whose shadows Were brighter than our day; And he sang of the streams and meadows, And then he went away. Now I turn from the heart that ever Will moan for the clay behind; When the soul is such glorious liver In the boundless realms of mind. So at night when the shadows grow dreary, And a sorrow is in my breast, And the wings of life grow weary, And flutter as if for rest: Then I open my little book-case, When the quiet is breathing low, And I take from the shelf in silence A volume of long ago. And I read and read by the firelight, Till quick and clear as chimes The man himself is with me, And is talking to me in rhymes: Talking of waving meadows And cunningly-hidden brooks, With the quietest gush of eddies That the flowers may see their looks: Babbling of summer and sunshine, And hills that reach the cloud; And thisâall this in whispers, For he never speaks aloud. Then betimes when I shut the volume To walk in the quiet street, When the stars, which are shadows of angels, Have made the silence sweet: He follows me still like a presence That none but spirits see; And at every pause of my footstep His music is speaking to me: Whispers and speaks till the night-time So trembles with all its tone That I cannot but let my being Move into the clasp of his own. So whenever I lift the volume, Like summer-beams that glow, That spirit comes out from the silence And babbles of long ago. A PARTING. First appeared in Cassell's Magazine, and taken from that Magazine by kind permission of Messrs. Cassell, Petter, and Galpin. The sunlight fell through the shadowy trees In smiles all soft and sweet, While the incense breath of an early-breeze Stirr'd the primrose at our feet. And you stoop'd to pluck its round bright eye That peep'd up to the day, Then turn'd from its golden bloom with a sigh, For your thoughts were far away. Ay, far away with some dearer one, And hearing within your ear, Breath'd out in love's low undertone The vows that you loved to hear. I knew I had no share in your heart, And yet I could but speak, While my life's sweet thoughts began to start With the blush upon your cheek. But you whisper'd as light as a leaf when turn'd By the breath of the wooing wind, A low sweet whisper, as if it mourn'd For the pain it left behind. And your eyes for a moment met my own With the love that might have been, Then slowly sank, and their light was gone, And the sunlight fell between. Ah me! through that sunlight I see thee now, With the old-love-bloom on your cheek, And within your eyes the same sweet glow Of the thoughts you would not speak. Then my heart, like a pilgrim, makes its choice, And flings all thoughts away, And listens again to thy low sweet voice, As thine own did to his that day, WHERE I AM LYING NOW. The first sweet wind of the summer Is breathing upon my cheek, And swaying the heads of the grasses That throb with a wish to speak. The spray is upon the hawthorn, The leaf is out on the bough, The light swift birds Are singing sweet words Where I am lying now. My head is upon a primrose My hand on a violet, My foot has bent down a daisyâ It is looking up at me yet. Two butterfliesâone like snow-drift, The other like blood, I trowâ Dip their fairy hues In the earth's sweet dews, Where I am lying now. I turn away from the sunlight That is falling soft and rife, And I hear the angel's spreading The miraculous network of life. And still, as their hands are plying, They murmur a tender vowâ From heaven to earth It is one great birthâ Where I am lying now. O, dweller within the city, Come forth from its smoke and dust, And, were it but one hour only, Clean thy soul from its growing rust. Here stretch thyself on this couch of grass, With a hand upon thy brow, And take a part, With a poet's heart, In the dreams I am dreaming now. A MEMORY. First appeared in Cassell's Magazine, and taken from that Magazine by kind permission of Messrs. Cassell, Petter, and Galpin. As soft as an autumn leaf will light When the winds are hush'd and still, Fell your hand into mine that summer night, When the moon rose above the hill. And silent and pale through the holy skies Rose she on her starry throne; But I turn'd from her beams to your own sweet eyes, That were looking up to my ownâ Looking up to my own, dear love, With their sweetest and tenderest glow, As the angels may look from their home above On their kindred types below. And I saw in their depths, like some glorious balm, All the wealth of their loving lore; And the thoughts in my breast grew into calm, That were restless an hour before; And the earth had a brighter look for me, For I saw with other eyes, And a whisper rose up like some symphony Spirit-sung in paradise. And beneath that whisper we stood nor stirr'd, The silence was so divine; While our hearts, not our lips, spoke their own sweet word, And your eyes look'd up to mine. O night! that now like a star is seen In the past's ever golden sky, Come back with the joy and the thrill that have been, And that dear love-melody. And it comes again with its magic tone, And the stars come out to teach, And your hand falls as light as a leaf in my own, And our eyes look into each. Then the thoughts that are restless in my breast Grow as still as still may be; And my heart feels the calm of thine own sweet rest, And that dear love-melody. So whenever my life will droop and pine, And my thoughts rush to and fro, Then I dream that your hand slips into mine As it did in the long ago. AGNES. First appeared in Chambers' Journal, and taken from that Journal by kind permission of W. &amp; R. Chambers. I open again the garden door, When the flowers live their little time, And I stand as you used to stand before By the rose-bush in its prime. And I pluck one bud from the laden stemâ This is for you I say; Then I take a leaf from the glowing gem, And fling the rest away. Now why should I place this single leaf Where my other treasures lie? And why should I keep it like the grief That is seen in a thoughtful eye? I keep it because it was thus you stood, That golden afternoon, Plucking a rose in your maiden mood, And humming a low, sweet tune: Humming a low, sweet tune alone, And watching, with half a smile, The fairy rose-leaves that were strewn Around your feet the while. And I stood in the shade of the garden door, And heard you at your song, And saw the rich leaves downward pour As the low winds came along. Now, when death has pluck'd your life's sweet bud, And your footsteps are heard no more, I think it a joy to stand where you stood, By the rose at the garden door. So I creep in as beneath some fear And pluck with trembling hand A rose from the bush you held so dear Ere you went to the spirit land. And I take one leaf from the budâno moreâ Then fling the rest away, And turn again to the garden door In the golden summer day. And I whisper, âThe bud that I resign Is thy clay to its own earth given; But the leaf that I keep is that spirit of thine, With its incenseâall of Heaven.â [O! just to see you again, Annie] O! just to see you again, Annie, To walk with your hand in mine; To stand by your side and look, Annie, Into those eyes of thineâ Into the thoughts and the depths of those eyes, As I did two years ago, When we stood by the old gray tower, Annie, With the woods and the fields below. But the wish sinks away as it forms, Annie; Only from over the sea, When the twilight is coming down, Annie, You are singing that song to meâ Singing that song, and the dear old words, Like the incense of angels rise, And their music is in my heart, Annie, While the tears are in my eyes. SONNETS TO A FRIEND. (After a Tour through Belgium and Germany.) I. [We part: great London with its mighty rush] We part: great London with its mighty rush Of life will daily send its shocks through thine, As tides go up a river, but on mine The quiet hamlet with its quiet hush Will fall like murmurs in the night. But still, When the low ebbs are with us, shall we not Dream the fair dreams of many a pleasant spot, By which we wander'd with a happy will! I know that all between the roaring trains, When their wild thunder sinks, that I shall hear The murmur of the Rhine within my earâ All soft and tremulously sweet, like strains Sung by some fair witch-maiden, ere the moon Touches a mountain that will hide her soon. II. [And with the murmur of the Rhine will come] And with the murmur of the Rhine will come Those legends which have flung, as from a sky We cannot see but with the inner eye, A light that rests as in its chosen home, On hill, and peak, and old gray towers that stand Like sentinels to guard the rear of Time; For he, too, lingers in that fairy clime, And turns the glass with an unwilling hand. Sweet Rolandseck and sweeter Drachenfels Shall be with me, and glimpses of the vine Big with the purple promise of the wine; Bingen, whereon the sloping sunshine dwells; The Lorelei rock, whose echoes still prolong The moonlight witchery of Heine's song. III. [Through these the town of Rubens shall arise] Through these the town of Rubens shall arise, Its stone arms clasping the cathedral, where His dead Christ sends a worship through the air, And takes the daily light from out the eyes Of those that look in awe; for there they see Divinity as death, and woman's hands Clasping his feet as tender as can be; While all behind the gazer as he stands, Devotion bends the knee in that rich light Which flings a noonday twilight all around, That trembles as the organ lifts again To fretted roof that narrows to the sight, Its unseen wailing hands of holy sound In moaning benedictions over men. IV. [The sunshine over Brussels will be mine] The sunshine over Brussels will be mine, But for a moment ere it pales its hue, And slowly deepens into one grim sign Of thunder on the field of Waterloo. The lower thunderbolts of men have spent The death-doom of their anger there, the plough Follows the mission of the sword that lent A red strength to the soil it cleaves. And now There will be golden harvest. Nature craves No boon from men. She only needs one spring To work her miracles, which, ere it pass, Has woven in the joy of fashioning, Over a battle-field and dead men's graves, The green forgetfulness of growing grass. V. [And quiet Weimar, hush'd of look and staid] And quiet Weimar, hush'd of look and staid, As if she knew the passing stranger came, Drawn to her by the splendour and the fame Of her two mighty sons, whose dust is laid Within her bosom side by side. And she Covers their ashes still with flowers that bind Mortals to all the high Immortals. He, Goetheâa sea without one waft of wind; Schillerâthe river yearning for that sea, High, pure and restless, with an upward mind. So let her keep their sacred dust. For through The march of ages as they sweep along, Will rise the potent voices of these twoâ The ocean and the river of her song. VI. [And thou, in such calm moments, wilt again] And thou, in such calm moments, wilt again Stand in that holy silent light which swims With unsung liturgies and incensed hymns That ever teach us life is light and vain! Nay, in thy spirit thou wilt walk in awe Adown the column'd vista of the nave, Till transept, altar, and high architrave Deepen and take the universal law Of worship. Or wilt thou become as one Who hath no motion, and with eyes that seem To gaze beyond their light, drink in the mild Celestial splendour of our Raphael's dream, And steep'd in all the art thou gazest onâ Half worship the Madonna and her Child! VII. [Half worship? Nay, full worship must be thine] Half worship? Nay, full worship must be thine, For all the best of Raphael's soul is there, Glowing as in that hour when the divine Vision was with him, and the very air Was wavy with that glory which we now See crowning, with a splendour fair and mild, The Virgin Mother as she clasps the Child And smiling, for the sweetness on her brow Is of that other light the painter saw In those high moments when his glorious art Lay round him like a heaven. We turn away Breathing the spell of some unconscious awe, And, turning, keep that sweetness in our heart That mingles not with that of common day. VIII. [Or Guido, where beneath the crown of thorns] Or Guido, where beneath the crown of thorns Love haloes the divinest of all eyes, And struggles with despair with unheard sighs, Conquers, and in conquering ever mourns Behold the man! But thou canst never reach, Even with thy spirit's purest touch, That sorrow, or enfold in thy frail speech The earnest sad divinity of such. Thou seest only as through tears, the dread Shadow of that agony of pain, And those grand eyes that ever look above With that far yearning, till, from overhead, God stoops and slowly arches in the twain, The unfading glory of unconquer'd love. IX. [I know thou wilt. And so to me the past] I know thou wilt. And so to me the past Is richer from my pleasant days with thee, And wears a happy memory to me, That, though the years may dim and die, will last. We were not as we said with jest and smile, âTwo idle dreamers of an empty day;â The future takes its colour and display From what is best within us. So the while There might be rising to the inner ken The larger nature which must come with thought Grown wider from a wider view of earth, And earnest purposes to shape our lot To all the grander things that take their birth Wherever God reveals Himself to men. THE END.</field>
