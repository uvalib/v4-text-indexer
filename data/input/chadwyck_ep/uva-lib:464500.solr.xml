      <field name="fulltext">10. The Child of Bristowe Square brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. He that made bothe helle &amp; heuene, Man &amp; womman, in dayes VII, And alle shal fede and fille, He graunte vs alle his blessynge, More &amp; lasse, bothe olde &amp; yonge, That herkeneth &amp; hold hem stille. The beste song that euer was made Ys not worth a lekys blade, But men wol tende Ã¾er-tille. Therfor y pray yow in Ã¾is place, Of your talkynge Ã¾at ye be pes, Yf it be youre wille. I found it writen in olde hand That som-tyme dwellid in Englond A squyer mykel of myght; He had castels, tounes &amp; toures, Feyre forestis &amp; feldes with floures, Beestis wilde and wight. To lawe he went a gret while, Pore men he lerned to begile Alle agayns the right; Mykel good he gadred to-gedir Alle with treson &amp; dedis lither; He drad not god almyght. The good he gadred to-geder than, He had it of many a pore man, The most partye with wronge. He had a sone, shuld be his heyre, Of shap he was semely &amp; feyre, Of lymes large &amp; longe. So moche his mynde was on Ã¾at childe: He rought not whom (he) begiled Worly good to fonge, And al to make his sone so riche That none other myght hym be licheâ So ment he euer amonge. When the child was XII yere &amp; more, His fader put hym vnto lore, To lerne to be a clerke. So longe he lernyd in clergie Til he was wise and wittye, And drad al dedis derke. The fader seid to his sone dere: âTo lawe thu shalt go a yere, And coste me XX marke; For euer the better thu shalt be: Ther shal no-man begile the, Neyther in word ne werkeâ The child answerd with a softe sawe: âThey fare ful wel Ã¾at lerne no lawe, And so y hope to do; That lyue wiI y neuer lede To put my soule in so gret drede To make god my foo. To sle my soule, it were routhe. Any science that is trouthe Y shal amytte me ther-to; For to forsake my soule helthe, For any wynnyng of worldes welthe, That wille y neuer do. Hit hath euer be myn avise To lede my lyf by marchandise, To lerne to bye and selle; That good getyne by marchancye It is trouthe, as thenketh me; Ther-with wille y melle. Here at Bristow dwellith on, Is hold right a iuste, trew man, As y here now telle: His prentys wille y be VII yere, His science truly for to lere, And with hym wille y dwelle.â The squyer vnto Bristow rode And with the marchand cownant made VII yere to haue his sone; He gaf hym gold gret plente, The child his prentys shuld be His science for to conne. The child toke ful wel to lore; His loue was in god euer-more, As it was his wone. He wax so curteise &amp; bolde: Al merrchaunt? loued hym, yong &amp; olde, Ãat in Ã¾at contre gan wone.â Leue we now that child thore, And of his fader speke we more, That was so stoute &amp; bolde. He was avaunced so hye: Ther was no-man in Ã¾at contre Durst done but as he wolde. And euer he vsid vsery, He wold not lene but he wyst why Avauntage dobelle tolde; Tethynges he liste neuer to pay; Yf parsones &amp; vicares wold oght say, He newid hem cares colde. Alle thyng wol ende atte last. God on hym soche sekenes cast: He myght no lenger abide, But on his ded-bed he lay And drow toward his endyng day, For al his power &amp; pride. Then he sent for knyghtes &amp; squyers, Whiche were his comperys, In that contre besyde. He seid emonges hem euerychon: âSires, my lyf is nere gone, Hit may not be denyede.â Ther was no-man in Ã¾at contre That his excutour wold be, Nor for no good ne ille; They seid his good was geten so: They wold not haue Ã¾er-with to do, For drede of god in heuen. He prayed hem, &amp; they seid nay. Allas he seid and welaway, With a rufulle stevyne. After his sone son he sent Evyn to Bristow verramentâ Was thens but myles VII. The child to chamber toke his way There his fader on ded-bed lay, And asked hym of his chere. âSone, he seid, wel-come to me! Y ly here now as Ã¾? may se, My endyng day negheth nere. But, sone, thu most be myn heyre Of al my londes, good &amp; faire, And my lordschips fere &amp; nere. Therfor, sone, now y pray the Myn attourney that thu be, When y am broght to bere.â The child answerd with wordes mylde: âYe se, fader, y am but a childe, Discrecion haue y none; To take soche a charge on me, By my faith! that shal not be, Y can no skyle ther-on. Here ben knyghtes &amp; squyers Whiche were your compers, And many a worthy man; Yf y shuld soche on me take That alle thes worthi men forsake, A fole then were y one!â He seid: ây haue no sone but the, And myn heire Ã¾? most nedis beâ Ther may no-man sey nay. Moche good haue I gadred to-geder With extorcion &amp; dedis litherâ Alas and welaway! Alle this, sone, y gadred for the: And thu so sone failest me At my nedeful day! Frendship, sone, is ylle to triste, Eche man be ware of âhad y wisteâ, God wote, so may y say. Sone, he seid, thu scapest not soâ That shalt Ã¾? weten, or thu goâ Hethen charge y the: To-fore god thu mothe answere, And as thu wilt my blessyng bere, Myn attourney that thu be.â âA, fader, ye bynde me with a charge, And y shal bynde yow with as large As ye bynde now me: The same day fortenyght Ã¾at ye passe Y charge yow appere in this place, Your spiret lat me se! For ye haue bound me so sare, Now y most nedis, how-euer y fare, Do youre commaundement. Therfor y charge yow Ã¾at ye appere, That y may se your soule here, Whethir it be saued or shent,â And that ye do no scathe to me, Ne none that shal come with the!â âSone, he seid, y assent. But allas that y was borne, Ãat man is soule shuld be lorne For my golde or rent.â Al thyng most ende atte last. God soche sekenys on hym cast, That he most nedis go. The parishe prest vp was soght, The glorioste sacrament with hym he broght That dyed for mannys woo; There he shrowe hym with hert sore, And cryed god mercy euer-more, As it was tyme to do. When god wold, he went his way. His sones song was welaway, Fo(r) hym his hert was wo. His sone sought fro toune to toune For prestis &amp; men of religione, The dirige for to say. An C prestis he had &amp; mo; Gret yeftys he gaf hem tho, Chargyng hem for his fader to pray. Yonge children had gret hole And pore wymmen had gret doleâ That holpe hym not a day. And sitthe broght hym in his pyttâ As al men muste, thei may not flyt, Whethir thei be wel or nay. When thei had broght hym in his graue, His sone, Ã¾at thoght his soule to saue Yf god wold gef hym leue, Al the catel his fader hade He sold it vp &amp; money made, And labored morow &amp; eve: He sought aboute in Ã¾at contre tho Where any almes myght be do, And largely he dud hem yeue, Wayes &amp; brugges for to make, And pore men for goddis sake He yeaf them gret releve. Who-so axed oght, he made here pay, And XXX?? trental of masses he let say For his fadres sake. He let neuer til he had bewared Alle the tresour his fader spared, Aseth to god forto make. By Ã¾at day fortenyghtis ende was come, His gold was gone, alle &amp; someâ Many one of hym spake; And al thynges that were meuable He gaf aboute with-outen fable To pore men that wold take. By than Ã¾e fourtenyght was broght to ende, The child to the chamber gan wende Where his fader dyed. Adoune he knelid half a day, Al the good prayers Ã¾at he couthe say (!) His fader forto abide. Betwene mydday and vnder Ãer cam a blast of lightnynge &amp; dunder Thurgh the walles wide, As al Ã¾e place on fire had be. The child seid benedicite And fast on god he cryde. And as he sate on his prayere, Sone before hym gan appere Foule tydynges betwene: His faders soule brennynge as glede, The deuel bi Ã¾e nekke gan hym lede In a brennynge cheyne. This child seid: ây coniure the, What-so-euer Ã¾? be, speke to me!â That other answerd ageyne: âY am thi fader that Ã¾e begate. Now thu may se of myn astate: Lo, how y dwelle in peyne.â The child seid: âful woo is me In this plite that (y) yow se; Hit persheth myn hert sore.â âSone, he seid, thus amy led, For be-cause of my falshed That y vsed euer-more, Mi good was getyn wrongfully. But it myght restored be And aseth be made ther-fore, An C yere thus shal y do. Gef me my trouthe y were ago! For til than my soule is lore.â âNay, fader, that shal not be, In better plite y wol yow be, Yf god wol gef me grace. But ye shal me your trouthe plighte: This same day fourtenyght Ye shal appere in this place. And y shal laboure, yf y may, To bryng your soule in better way, Yf y haue lyf and space.â He graunted hym in gret hast. With that ther cam a donder-blast, And bothe ther way gan passe. The child had neuer so gret sorwe. He rose vp apone the morwe, To Bristow gan he wende. To his mayster he gan say: âY haue serued yow many a day: For goddis loue be my frend! My fader out of this world is past. Y am come to yow in hast, Y haue euer founde yow kynde: Me nedith a litel somme of gold: Myn heritage shal be sold, Croppe, rote and rynde.â His maister seid: âwhat nede were the To selle thi thrift so hastely? It were not for thy prow. Yf thu any bargeyn haue boght, For gold ne siluer care Ã¾? noght: Y shal lene the right ynow. An C mark yf thu wilt haue, This VII yere I wil none craue. Wherfor avise the now! For yf thu selle thyn heritage That shuld Ã¾e helpe in thi yonge age, An vnwise man art thow.â âGramercy, he seid, mayster hende, This was a proffer of a frende. But truly, it shal be sold. Better chepe ye shal it haue Then any man, so god me saue! For nedys y must haue gold.â He seid: âwhat is it worth by yere?â âAn C marke of money clere: The stuward this me toldeâ. âThen shal y gef the III C pound, Euery peny hole and roundâ. The yonge seid: ây holde. Dere mayster, y yow pray, Haue here dedis, sech me my pay! For y most home agayne. Y haue to do in soundre place, Y pray yow of fourtenyght space, Y shal yow quytte, certayneâ. His mayster loued hym so welle: He fette hym gold euery delle. Than was Ã¾e child ful fayne, He toke his good &amp; gan to goâ &amp; for his fader his hert was woo That bode in so mykel payne. His sone lete crie alaboute In churches &amp; markettis with-oute doute Wher his fader dud wone, Where his fader dud destritione To man or womman in any toune, They shuld come to his sone, âAnd he shal make aseth Ã¾er-fore And his good ayen restore, Eche man his porcioneâ. Euer as they come, he made here pay, And charged hem for his fader pray In blisse that he myght wone. By that the fourtenyght was come, His gold was gon, al &amp; some, Then had he no more. In-to the chamber he went Ã¾at tide, The same that his fader in dyde, And knelid as he dud ore. And as he sate in his prayere, The spiret before hym gan appere, Right as he dud before, Saue Ã¾e cheyn away was caught; Blak he was, but he brent noght; But yet he was in care. âWelcome, fader! seid the childe, Y pray yow with wordes mylde, Tel me of youre astate!â âSone, he seid, the better for the. Y-blessid mote the tyme be That euer y the begate! Thou hast releuyd me of moche wo, My bitter chayne is fal me fro And the fire so hote. But yet dwel y stille in peyn, And euer must, in certeyne, Til y haue fulfilled my dayâ. âFader, he seid, y charge yow tel me: What is moste ayens the And doth yow most disese?â âTethynges &amp; offrynges, sone, he sayd, For y them neuer truly payd. Wherfor my peynes may not cesse But it be restored agayne To as many churches, in certayne, And also mykel encresse. Alle that for me thu dos pray, Helpeth me not to the vttermost day The valure of a pese. Therfor, sone, y pray the, Gef me my trouthe y left with the, And let me wynde my way!â âNay, fader, he seid, ye gete it noght. Another craft ther shal be soght, Yet efte y wille assay. But your trouthe ye shal me plight: This same day a fourtenyght Ye shal come ageyn to your day, Ye shalle appere here in this place; And y shal loke with goddis grace To amende yow, yf y mayâ. The spiret went forth in his way. The childe ros? vp that other day, For no-thynge wold he lette, Even to Bristow gan he wynde. There he mette with his maister hynde, Wel goodly he hym grette. âWhen y haue nede, y come to yow. Maister, but ye help me now, In sorwe my herte is sette; Me nedith a litel summe of gold, Another bargeyn make y woldâ And with that word he wepte. Hys maister seid: âÃ¾? art a fole, Thu has bene at som bad scole; By my feith! y hold the mad. For thu has played atte dice Or at som other games nyce And lost vp sone Ã¾at thu had. Thu hast right noght Ã¾at Ã¾? may selle: Alle is gone, as y here telle. Thi gouernaunce, sone, is badâ. Then he seid vntil his maister fre: âMyn owne body y wil selle to the, For euer to be thy lad. Bonde to the y wille me bynde, Me &amp; alle myne to Ã¾e worldis ende, To helpe me in this nedeâ. He seid: âhow mykel woldest Ã¾? haue?â âXL mark, and ye wold foche-saue, For that shuld do my dede. I hope that shal my cares keleâ. The burges louyd Ã¾e child so wele, That to his chamber he yede; XL pound he gan hym brynge: âSone, here is more than thyn askynge. Almyghti god the spede!â âGramercy, sire! gan he say, God yow quytte, that best may! And trewe ye shal me fynde. Y haue to do a thynge or two, A fourtenyght gef me lef to go! Y haue euer founde yow kyndeâ. He gaf hym leue. he went his way, But on his fader he thoght ayâ He goth not out of mynde. He sought alle Ã¾e churches in Ã¾at contre Where his fader had dwellid by, He left not one behynde. He made aseth with hem echon. By Ã¾at tyme his gold was gone, They couthe aske hym no mare. Saue as he went by Ã¾e strete, With a pore man gan he mete, Almost naked and bare. âYour fader oweth me for a ?eme of cornââ Done he knelid hym beforneâ âAnd y hym drad ful sare. For your fader soules sake, Som amendes to me ye make, For hym that Marie bare!â âWelaway, seid Ã¾e yonge man, For my gold &amp; siluer is gan; Y haue not for to payâ. Of his clothes he gan take And put hem on Ã¾e poreman is bake, Chargynge for his fader to pray; Hosen &amp; shon he gaue hym tho, In sherte and breche he gan go, He had no clothes gay. In-to the chamber he went Ã¾at tide, The same Ã¾at his fader on dyde, And knelid half a day. When he had knelid &amp; prayed longe, Hym thoght he herd Ã¾e myriest songe Ãat any erthely man myght here. After the song he saw a light, As thow a thousant torches bright: It shone so faire and clere. In that light so faire lemand A naked child in angelis hand Before hym dud appere And seid: âsone, blessid thu be, And alle Ã¾at euer shalle come of the, That euer thu goten were!â âFader, he seid, ful wel is me, In that plite that y yow se! Y houe that ye be saueâ. âSone, he seid, y go to blisse. God almyghti quyte the this Thi good ageyn to haue. Thu has made the ful bare, To aqueynche me of mykel care. My trouthe, good sone, y craueâ. âHaue your trouthe, he seid, fre, And of thi blessynge y pray the, Yf that ye wold foche-saueâ. âIn that blessynge mote Ã¾? wone That oure lady gaf here sone, And myn on the y layâ. Now that soule is gon to blisse, With moche ioye and angelis, More then y can say. This child thanked god almyght And his moder, Marye bright, When he sey that aray. Even to Bristow gan he gon, In his sherte &amp; breche alloneâ Had he no clothes gay. When Ã¾is burges Ã¾e child gan se, He seid then âbenedicite! Sone, what araye is this?â âTruly, maister, seid Ã¾e childe, Y am come me to yelde As youre bonde-manâ. The burges seid anone right: âMe mervayleth mykel of Ã¾is sight. Tel me now, how it ys?â âWhat-som-euer ye put me to, After my power it shal be do, While my lyf wil lasteâ. âFor Ã¾e loue be-twene vs hath be, Telle me, sone, how it stant with the, Why thu gos in this aray?â âSir, al my good y haue sold, ywys, To gete my fader to heuene blys, For-sothe, as y yow say. For ther was no-man but y That wold be his attourny At his endynge dayâ. Tho he told hym furthere How ofte he dud his fader appere And eke in what aray. âAnd now his soule into blisse Y sey hym led with angelis. Al-myghti god the yelde! For thurf youre good he is saue. And his dere blessyng y haue, And al my cares be keldeâ. âSone, he seid, blessid mote Ã¾? be That so pore woldest make the, Thi faders soule to saue! To speke Ã¾e honour may almankynde: Thu art a tristy, siker frendeâ Soche fynde y but sildene. But fewe sones ben of tho That wol serue here fader so, When he is hens gone. Sectours fynd y many on, But none soche as Ã¾? art on, By my feith! y leve not onâ. Hys maister seid: ây shal Ã¾e telle: Thu canst bothe bye &amp; selle: Here now make y the Myn owne felow in al wise Of worldly good &amp; marchandise, For thy trouthe so fre. Al-so, sone, y haue no childe, Myn heritage for to wilde, Goten of my body: Here y make the now myn heyre Of alle my landes, good &amp; faireâ And myn attorney that Ã¾? beâ! His maister dud hym weddid be To a worthy man is doghter of Ã¾at contre, With ioye and grete solace. And when his mayster was ded, In-to alle his good he entred, Londes, catelle and place. Thus hath Ã¾is yonge man keuered care, First was riche &amp; sitthen bare, And sitthen riccher then euer he was. Now he Ã¾at made bothe helle &amp; heuene And alle the worlde in dayes seuene, Graunte vs alle his grace! Amen. Explicit the Tale of the Childe of Bristow.</field>
