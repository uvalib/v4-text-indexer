      <field name="fulltext">To the right honorable his Singuler good Lord, Sir Thomas Egerton, Knight, Lord Keper of the greate Seale.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Embleames. (1) Pietie and Impietie. When false Synon, with tongue of guilefull tale, had caused the monstrous woodden horse of Greece to enter Troy wales, the bitter bale of Priams state, flaminge in everie peece, throughe raginge fiers, Eneas, full of pittie, his sonne and father ledd forth of the Cittie. He bare his aged Syre on shoulders stronge,‚Äî oh sweete burdenn! the which the sonne did crave,‚Äî and in his hand, Aschainus ledd alonge. oh Fathers love! which never end maye haue. his father, him self, his sonne, throughe Grecian foes Eneas leades, when hee from Troye goes. A lovinge deede of famous pietie, when strength of youth releeveth feeble sprite; a natural deed of sonne his love and dutie, to helpe his syre, which brought him into light; for which this holie mann doth iustelie gaine renowned fame, for ever to remayne. But thow, oh wicked monster of beastlie minde, Cruell and blodie Nero, the dregges of kinges, contrarie to Nature, and fleshlie kinde, (with greefe I doe abhorr to wright these thinges) didst noe whit shame, thy mothers wombe to teare, to see where shee did such a viper beare. Wherfore to thee is left perpetuall shame, to kill thy mother, to answere thy desire. But to Eneas, doth growe eternall fame, that sav'd his aged father from the fire: hee, for reward, rais√´d Troy walles againe; thow, for reward, in beastlie sort wert slaine. (2) Vertue should not be condempned for one smale imperfection. The heavenlie pallas of Celestiall skye, resoundes with pleasant notes of musicks skill; the godds and goddesses, with mellodie, to Genius doe sacrifice their fill. They leave the Care they had for earthlie thinges; they daintie feastes freequent with sweet delight, before whose eyes faire Venus freshlie springes, in apt measure daunsing, with comelie sight. Shee footes it soe, with crowne of flowers in hand, that all the godds extoll her for the same; but beinge prais'd by that moste sacred bande, Momus beginns her daunsinge for to blame. And findinge fault,‚ÄîI knowe not well wherfore, still redie, what best is, for to deface,‚Äî affirmd the slipper which faire Venus wore, with craaking noyse, her dauncinge did disgrace. (3) Temperance abateth fleshlie Delightes. Thow Cithereane Venus, I would knowe, why thow, and Cupid houldinge of his bowe, soe pensive bee, and over fier doe stande, warming of thy feete, and warming of his hande? Oh why? doth love and luste feele their decaye, Yf Ceres and Iacchus be awaye? Where Sobernes doth raigne amongst the wise, there lust and hurtfull pleasures still doe frise. They finde noe foode, nor anie warrs, can make against the modest which sparing diet take. but if that wealth and dronkennes beare stroke, they, wicked warres of Lecherie, provoke. (4) Death and Cupid. The hatefull Death Ioynd to the God of loue in one Cabine setled themselves to sleepe; both had their bowes and shaftes, their might to prove; the one gaue mirth, the other forct to weepe. Thus blinded love, and death at this time blinde, by chance doe meete, by chance doe harbor finde. But starting forth of this their former rest, heedlesse, the one, the others weapons caught: the goulden shaftes from Cupid, Death berefte; the dartes of Death, dame Venus sonne had raughte. thus contrarie to kinde, and their nature, Cupid doth slea, and Death doth love procure. Ould doating fooles, more fit for Carons shipp. that feele the goute, to grave which take their waye, doe fall in love and youthfull-like doe skippe, deckinge their heads with garlands fresh and gaye. Their yeares and daies they easelie doe forgett, and from their harte, colde sottishe sighes do fett. But striplinges and yonge boyes that wounds receive by yonge Cupid, then Nestor, yet more oulde, against their kinde, their wished lift doe leave, and vnto Acheron the waye doe houlde. But Cupid, cease! and Death, thine owne stroke give! Let yonge menn love, let ould menn cease to live. (5) Art, the antidote against fortune. On rolling ball doth fickle fortune stande; on firme and setled square sitts Mercurie, The god of Arts, with wisdomes rodd in hande: which covertlie to vs doth signifie, that fortunes power, vnconstant and still frayle, against wisdome and art cannot prevaile. ffor as the Sphere doth move continuallie, and showes the course of fickle fortunes change, soe doth the perfect square stand stedfastlie, and never stirrs, though fortune liste to range. wherefore, Learne Artes, which allwaies stedfast prove; therbye, hard happes of fortune to remove. (6) Labour quencheth Lecherie. Dictinian Diana, which Of Ph≈ìbus borroweth lighte, The glistring Queene of Woodes and groves, and Ladie of the nighte, Pursues the Hart‚Äîwhose nimble feete doe make him seeme to flie,‚Äî with bowe and howndes, whose thundringe voice doth Eccho in the Skye. Yonge Cupid is not farr behinde, but followeth on as as faste. He shootes, but leaves no wound; in vaine his fierie dartes are caste. If Ignorant of cause thow bee, why loue can take not holde Of chast and travelinge Diane, Of this thow maiste be bolde: It is, for that shee not consumes her golden time in vaine, Nor Idle thoughts of wanton youth doe harbor in her brayne; ffor, flienge Canker of slothfull eise, in huntinge spends the daye, Wastinge her time with those delights, to beate fond thoughts awaie. Whoe therfore wiselie seekes to shunn the force of Cupids Ire vse exercise, flie Idle thoughtes; soe shalt thow quench his fire. (7) Fortune. There is a birde which takes the name of Paradise the faire, Which allwaies lives, beatinge the winde, and flienge in the Ayre. For envious nature him denies the helpe of resting feete, wherby hee forced is, in th'ayre incessantlie to fleete. Soe the vncertaine light and wilde fowle fortune variable, whoe onlie in vnconstancie doth shewe herself most stable, Doth never, in one pace or sorte, prove constant in her power, But doubtfull, fleeting here and there, still changing everie hower. Wherefore the cunninge Smirnians her Image carved out, With feete cut from her leggs, and sette on ball turninge aboute. And for she could not setled stande, they sayd, as doth appeare, `Sweet Fortune, thow dost flie in th'ayre, like birde depainted here.' (8) Bryberie. After his Fathers funerall, when as Tiberius went Vnto his howse, his tender harte with pittie did relent; For, seeinge of a wretched mann with scabbs and sores opprest, On whom the suckinge flies did feed, not suffringe him to reste, Hee calld his servant, willinge him to drive awaye with speed, Those Cormorantes which eate his fleshe, and forced him to bleede. The mann obayed: but when he would haue beate those flies awaye, Thee wretched sowle did him forbid, and mourninglie did saye: ‚ÄúYf that these gorged gnawinge flies, full glutted with my bloode, Were beaten from their place of praye, newe troope, not half soe good, Leane and greedie, with hungrie mawes, would then renewe my paine, and suck my blood even to the death, not sparinge anie vayne. Soe the old Iudge, once fullie fraughte with guiftes and briberie, Will not be easilie ledd by guiftes to wrest the lawes awrye. But hee that commeth newe in place, and thirsteth after gould, Or his Iuditiall office buyes, with him there is noe hould; for hee that buies, is forct to sell; and new corrupted Iudge Takes all and more; and, for reward, is made a sinfull drudge. (9) Immortallitie of the Sowle. In former age, the Ethnikes, false gods servinge, this solempne Ceremonie vsed to their dedd, That when the paled corps went to buryenge, a lawrell Crowne they wreathed about his head. The cause wherof being asked by Adrian, the famous Emperour of the Romaine state, Byas replied: ‚Äòbecause that then, ech man whome death reduceth to that happie state, ‚Äòforsaken hath all worldlie wretchednes; they feele noe greefe, or sorrowes heavie payne; wherfore, since they attaine such blessednes, this garland shewes the Crowne which they doe gayne.‚Äô Then since those vertuous Ethnickes, with such Ioye addornd the funeralls of deceased wighte, Whose faithelesse sowles, feirce Pluto did destroye,‚Äî for vnto them was shut the gate of lighte,‚Äî Why should we faithfull Christians bewaile our loved frendes, and celebrate with greefe‚Äî the manne deceased, with scaping Satans gayle, leaves woe, and winns a place of sweete releefe,‚Äî Since vnto vs is made assured promise for to enioye the vision of gods sight, and to ascend celestiall place of blisse, our god to praise, in whome wee shall delight. (10) Sotted loue. Autoritie and Loue will scarce agree, and in one place are neuer found to bee; for decencie must serve to ech estate, and ech must live according to his fate. Nice Sardanapalus, th'assirian Kinge, a mann effeminate in losse livinge, doth fall in love, and loves so foolishlie that hee forgetts his state and maiestie. For, leaving of the kingdomes needfull charge, and Heroike deedes, his kingdome to enlarge, (oh sottishe loue!) hee whollie followeth luste; hee followes Venus; in her doth hee truste; hee locks himself from other companie; and farr abasing his Regalitie, not like a valiant mann, but all from kinde, in woemens workes doth cheefest comfort finde: hee cardes, and spinnes with distaffe in his hande; hee workes and sowes, fast wrapt in Venus bande. Wherfore yf thow wilt gayne an honest name, and deedes performe to winn eternall fame, Let Wemenn never soe bewitch thy witt, as thow be forc'd from thine owne kinde to flitt. (11) Pride. The morrall Seneca, whose penn intreatinge matters graue, I finde, amongst his learned workes, this worthie tale to haue:‚Äî There was a kinge of highe renowne, which iustice did vpholde. to him, three sonns did nature give, of courage feirce and bould. To eche, the choice of birdes hee gaue, wherbye that hee might learne, the severall humors of their minde and manners to discerne. The eldest, of his haughtie harte, the Eagle prowd did chuse. the second, of fiers disposition, the hawke would not refuse. The yongest, of a myleder minde, the vulgar thrushe did take; On whome the kinge bestowd his crowne, and him his heire did make. Iudge what the kinge ment by this guifte, for I maye not disclose it. And thow perhapps maie be deceived in thinkinge for to glose it. (12) Patience. The patient Socrates, true mirror of our life, whoe for the godds did yeald his heavenlie breth, twoe vnkinde wives did nourishe foolishlie,‚Äî the first was blinde, the other had bleare eyes,‚Äî of whome, good mann, he badlie was intreated. Not once, nor twice, but allwaies when they raged, the one would beastlie spurne him like a dogg; the other would belabour him with her fists; all which hee bare with vertuous patience. with bitter words, but being fiercelie baited, hee was enforct to leave the vnquiet howse; whoe, going forth, did rest him at the dore, where long hee could not quiet sitt at ease, but that these sprites, these furies fowle of hell, did add more ill to former wickednes; for as hee satt with calme and gentle minde, they on his hed did lothed vrine cast, and shrewdlie wett him to the tender skinne. But hee, which made of this a Iestinge sport, as well aquainted with such brain sick witts, vsed not revenge, but smilinglie did saye, that after thunder, Rayne did still descende; for hee these wives did keepe, for to envre his vertues rare, and patience to encrease. (13) Liberalitie. Why doe these virginns faire, the Graces three, Ioues daughters, borne of Eurinome the brighte, On goddesse Venus waite in theire degree, Since they from seed of heaven did take there lighte? because from these the fruites of love proceed, and loue is wonne by ech theire severall seed. Their Rosiall faces, shap'd are after one, as sister twinned, by reason ought to bee; the twoe, allwaies the third doe looke vpon; their youthfull age and bewtie doe agree: Winged at feete they are; they naked stande, ech halsing other with their cristall hande. The first wherof, Aglaia is named, and worthie place doth hould amongst the reste: A peerlesse Ladie, in ech place well famed, shining in honnor deepe harbored in her breste. the next, Thalia, which meaneth, as some teache, faire flower of youth, and elloquence of speach. The third, which wee call the faire Ephrosine, to her sisters in vertue not behinde, doth signifie (as learned menn define) the pleasant mirth and frute of frendlie minde. thus these Charites, these faire graces three, the forme of love, and guiftes, presents to mee. But why are they naked, without attyre? because they showe the playnesse of the harte, quite naked of decyte, and free from hire; for in all guiftes, this Is the chefest parte, that what we give, be donne with meere goodwill, with simple and pure minde, devoid of ill. Or ells because vnthankfull menn by kinde, whoe naked are of curtesie and love, Will naught bestowe, to shewe a gratefull minde; besides all which, as wee continuallie prove, the graces coffers are emptie and naked found; for thankfull menn, with wealth cannot abound. Whye are they virginns fayer, freshe, and bright? for that therby wee covertlie are tould, that of the frendlie guiftes receyvd, (by righte) perpetuall memorie wee are bound to hould; for, freshe in thankfull minde, wee must conceive the deepe record of favours wee receive. Why winged are their feete like mercurie? because that, whoe doth guiftes or thanks impart, must not deferr the same, but spedilie performe the frute of his well willinge harte; ffor hee gives twice, that quicklie and with speed bestowes his guift to serve our present need. Soe lovinglie, why are they Ioind in one? ech one, in armes embracing of her mate; and allwaies twoe, the third looking vpon? It shewes, that frendes must live without debate, that guiftes receyved, be paid with vsurie, and that true frendes fayle not in miserie. (14) Vertue of Herbes. Whilste prudent Epidaure, the learned leeche, the sacred herbes in fertill soyle doth seche, with stedfast eye caste on the vallies deepe, a tall yonge ladd,‚Äîwhich kepte the fearfull sheepe, adorned with crowne of herbes faire, freshe, and greene, of straunge devise, most orient to be seene,‚Äî This Epidaure beheld in greate despite, with Basiliske to vse most cruell fighte; which poysoning beaste, this manne (with Mars his blowe) did prostrate on the ground, and overthrowe. Then Epidaure (iudginge some vertue rare within the garland which the heardman ware,) Drewe nere, and by faire wordes did frendlie crave, that hee, of him this herbie Crowne might haue. wherto the herdman yealded his consent, and then a freshe to basiliske hee went, with that feirce beaste, movinge new fight againe, in which the sillie mann was easelie slaine. which donne, the phisition begann to saye, ‚Äòwithin this bowe, most secret vertue laye;‚Äô and with this garland freshe, in everie Ioynt the bodie of deade herdmann did annoynt. forthwith the mann (a thinge to all menn straunge) began to live, and life for deathe did change. Such vertues doth the power of god divine, for our releife, to yearthlie herbes assigne; wherbye wee maie from menn diseases take, Recover health, and dangers great forsake. (15) Wine. ffayne wouldst thow know wherfore the god last borne of Ioue his Thye, Is winged on his hed, and whye swifte Pegase standeth bye. And why the horse of true honnor conioyned is to Bacchus, The following verse, the springe and cause therof shall here discusse. When people with Amicla did the grapes to Bacchus bringe, She said, ‚Äòfaire Bacchus, I see winges from out the hedd to springe; Oh Bacchus, thow haste quivering winges, and heares that crowned bee with greene Ivye; let Gorgon horse allwaies associate thee. ffor Bacchus doth increase the blood, and force to vs it lendes; To melancholie harts, both mirth and cooller freshe it sends. It raiseth vpp dull mindes from Earth, to enterprise great thinges; It comforteth the weake sinnowes, and strength to witt it bringes. This doth the swifte Pegasine horse, conioynd with Bacchus tell, But yet to vse wine moderatelie, for soe shall witt excell.‚Äô (16) Mann. Behould, mann is the litle world, as Gretiane gaue him name, And as the ould Philosophers did signifie the same. ffor as the Sunn and Moone, bright lights, doe shine in azured Skye, Soe hath the mann two sparkling eyes which vnder forehedd lie. As goulden Sunn, with purple beames, in morning freshe doth springe, And going vnder Thetis bedd, on world the shade doth bringe, And soe doth rise and sett to vs, as other plannetts all, Soe mann by byrth doth rise and springe, by death doth sett and fall. The moving windes in skies that rowle, both hott and colde are founde; and in the mouth of breathing mann, both colde and heate abound. Our bones and members are the earth, the ayre in Lunges doth swell, The mouth and brayne doe water holde, the fire in hart doth dwell. Thus mann is moyst, earthlie, and hott, with water, earth, and fire, Be three the noblest Elements, which nature cann desire. To infancie compared is the spring, sweet, freshe, and gaye; the pleasant sommer vnto Youth, where strength and courage staie; The ripenesse of manns firme estate doth fruitfull Autumne holde; As crooked Age well likned is to winters frost and colde. (17) Witt. Nothing more smooth then artificiall glasse; more brickle, yet there nothing maye be founde; nothinge more white or fairer is on grounde then congeald snowe, yet naught lesse firme can passe. Soe, shining and fayre witts, in which abound Invention, quick conceit, and answering, three cheefest thinges, true praise deservinge, haue their desert, and most doe run awrye, Since finest white doth soonest take all staines, and finest witts are ficklest of their braines, whose self-conceit ruynes them vtterlie; much like the Bees, whose honnie breedes their paines by surfetting theron Immoderatelie, for, from her sweete, coms her perplexitie. Thus these rich witts, which fondlie deeme they all menn doe exceede, By trusting to themselves too much, doe fayle themselves at neede. (18) The subiect. The statlie flower that faire rich India yeldes, which goulden Heliotropium wee name, the glorious Marigolde of fruitefull feildes, the course of all his flowring time doth frame after the light of Ph≈ìbus norishinge flame, on which she waites with still attending eye, windinge her self like sonne, circularlie. Of which effect, the name she doth obtayne, &amp; Heliotropium, of sonne is calld. ffor, when bright Elios with the fierie wayne, his fower feirce steedes in purple morne hath stalld, Then this strange flower (with Sable night appalld) spredds forth her golden lockes, but hides her face when Phebus bedds, as fearing some disgrace Thus doth this noble flower, her homage due, paie to her Lord whome shee doth imitate, Houldinge that waie which her doth still pursue; whose pliant minde, to vs doth intimate, that as this flower, by natures hidden fate doth followe still the turning course of Sunn, wherin she pleasures till her life be donne, So pliant subiects follow still, whilst rulinge Prince doth live, The good or badd examples which his customd actions give. (19) Diligence obtayneth Riches. The simple Cock, that with a hungrie minde, on sluttishe dunghill scrapte, in stedfast hope, for his releefe, some feeding grayne to finde, being forct to seeke within that litle scope to hym assigned by fortunes luckye lott, a pretious Iewell for his paine hee gott; which, though to him smale profitt it did give, vnskillfull what the price therof mighte bee, yet did it shewe the godds, for to releeve the needie soule whome wee in labour see turmoyle with swetting face, for to sustaine his pore estate with such a luckie gaine. (20) Vsurie. The wealthie mann with blessings great indued, raising his mightie halls to looke alofte, whome never yet hath povertie pursued; yf that his greedie minde be sett to ofte to search for gaine, to fill his hungrie hart, some froward chance the godds to him impart. ffor a rich vsurer, which hordes of gould entombed from some in armed chest dyd keepe, not well content such heaped wealth to hould, but vnderminding earth, did often creepe in dungeons deepe, and mines of silver bright, to rake for that which was his harts delight. But Iust Pluto, a Iudge of rightfull rede, when as this mann had entred goulden Cave, his due desert, that was for him decreed, as Iuste revenge permitted him to haue, for hee by clodd (er hee might that auoyde) of fallinge earth, was suddenlie destroyd. Thus doe the godds to such as they enrich, when thanklesse persons allwaies will appeare; for thoughe to daye they send never soe mich, yet when they please, they can with frowning cheere spoyle them from all, but moste where they doe see vnsaciate mindes still griping for to bee. (21) Myrtilus Sheilde. The famous souldier, Myrtilus the Knighte, whose conquering minde did never stoope to feare, in manye conflictes the Garland Palme did beare, as well on Land, as in the Maryne fighte, such was his force, such was his warrlike might, still savinge his life by his helpfull Sheilde, both in the swelling Sea and bloodie feilde. On Land his faithfull sheild did him defend from dobled strokes of stronge revenging foes; and in mercilesse Seas devouringe woes, this sheild, from drowninge, him to shoare did sende, and brought him safe vnto his Iourneis ende: in all mishapps, at everie time of neede, this worthie Sheild did allwaies stand in steede. So, my good Lord, be you, I craue, to mee, Mirtilus sheild, where soe my bodie bee. (22) Vayne Ostentations. Wee dailie see the fruitfull Ph≈ìbus fier, how richlie it brings forth the wished harvest, which plenteouslie augments the owners hier, one hundred foulde contentinge his request, with his full eares still bending to the ground, wherin greate store of grayne in tyme is found. But bragg amongst the corne aspires proudlie, on emptie eare lookinge aboue the reste, advancinge his highe creste presumptuouslie even to the starrs, as though he were the beste, whoe, beinge lighte, and fruitlesse of all grayne, for want of waight, showes all pride is vayne. Soe hee whome litle learninge doth commende, is puft alofte with pride of highe conceite, and deemes his witt maye with Minerve contende, and scoole Mercurie with some queinte deceit; but whoe that braggs, and deemes himself most learned, most voide of art, by wise men is discernde; Since he is allwaies somwhat, himself that nothinge deemes; and he is nothinge found to be, himself that somwhat seemes. (23) Losse of hurtfull thinges is gayne. Producinge earth inrich'd, makes rich againe the toylinge laborer hopinge fruitfull gayne; but yf neglect, it vnmanurde growe, corruptinge weedes and harmefull plants do flowe. with wrootinge groyne, with feirce and warlike bore, turnes vp and betters that bad lande before, destroyeng those vnprofitable springes, to frutefull land which such annoyance bringes, which is not losse, but bettringe to the feilde, more holsome frute then redie for to yeilde. wherfore from thee, yf taken bee the thinge which needlesse is, and doth not profitt bringe, nor losse nor greife, let that be vnto thee, for weedes pluck'd vp, hurt not the ground, wee see. (24) Internall vertues are best. Sweet tasting aple, which this faire virginn beares, In cristall hand doth shine with pleasinge hewe, for in th'externall forme, to eye appeares a glistring cullor which doth delight renewe; but vnder that thinne Coate, fayre nature hides more gratefull frute, which shee for mann provides. Then thow, whome nature outwardlie hath graced with comelie shape, externall forme to winne, trust not therto; it wilbe soone defaced, as of noe vse, like to the Aples skinn. wherfore with vertue cloathe thy inwarde minde, that th'outward shape therbye maye comfort fynde; ffor what availes the gorgious showe of Apples outward skynn, Yf the internall frute conteyne not pleasing taste therin? (25) Threates of the inferior to be contemned. The melitane dogge, bredd onlie for delight, whose force is smale, though voice be lowde and shrill, with often barkinge putts greate doggs to flighte, incensd with rage, as though he would them kill. Yet thoughe hee threaten with moste cruell voice, leppinge and runninge in haste for to devoure the bloodie mastife, it lies not in his choice, as wanting both a naturall strength and power. ffor those greate dogges which flie not thence for feare, contempne his threates, scorning revenge to seeke, knowing the force and strength which they do beare is overmuch for him which is so weake. Soe hee whom strength and wisdome doth adorne, the brawles and anger of the weake doth scorne, since all the power wherin they doe abound, consiste in wordes, which vanishe with the sound. (26) Philosophie. Ioues sonne, the valiant Hercules, whose worthye travayling peyne, by his twelve labours, vnto him immortall fame did geyne, made this the best and last labour, as glorie of them all, That triple hedded Cerberus hee made to bee his thrall, The mightie cheyned porter of The darke infernall hell, where thinges obscure as dampned sprites in darke oblivion dwell. which inwardlie to vs vnfoulds Philosophies triple kinde, wherin doth rest the triple good of our celestiall minde. ffor as three hedds of Cerberus doe from one boddie growe, Soe from abstruse Philosophie, three severall springs doe flowe: Divine, humane, and naturall, wherin consist the parts of heavenlie and terene creatures, and of all learned artes, which are not conquered without great paynes of daye and night, as Hercules by painfull toyle brought Cerberus to light, That sharpe labour beinge the last, as cheefest and the best, therin, all former labours of the bodie for to reste. (27) Societie. The purple Rose which first Damasco bredd, adornd with cullor gratefull to the sight, hath in it self a fragrant smells delight, wherbye two sences of the mann is fedd. thoughe other things to such faire shewe haue right, yet maye they not equall this Rosie flower, whose dayntie smell therin hath cheefest power. Soe two faire dowries which mann doth enioye‚Äî true perfecte love, and suer fidelitie‚Äî firmelie preserve humane societie, their frends assisting in ech hard annoye, when want of ech brings noe securitie; both which, this damaske rose doth well vnfoulde, as honest hart, which fayth and love doth houlde. ffor as the rose, depriv'd of pleasing smell, retayning yet the cullor for the eye, or havinge smell, wanting righte bewtie, is not a rose, for both in that must dwell, or ells it cannot other flowers defie,‚Äî soe our societie, without love and fayth is never perfect, as true reason sayth; ffor where is perfect love, there trustie fayth is found, and where assured trust doth dwell, there love must needs abound. (28) Counsell and vertue subdue deceipfull Persons. The valiant knight whome Perseus wife did love, whome she exilde for hee would not consent, which tooke his name, as the effect doth prove, of Bellerus, a prince to mischeife bent, whose wicked deedes the Corinthes did susteyne whilste over them his tyrannie did Raigne;‚Äî ffor when his Heroike hand had Beller slayne, he called was Bellepheron the worthie, whose chefest glorie and fame which he did gayne, was, when he slue Chimera valiantlie, The Lician monster, that people which destroyed, and the Sea coastes on everie side annoyed. ffor Bellepheron, this Chimer (as he fledd) pursued on Pegasus, the horse of fame, (which of Medusas slater first was bredd, for vertuous deedes doe breed immortall fame), and him, with force of minde and warlike hand did slea, for naught maye strength and witt withstand. Soe you, my Lord, borne vp on Pegas wynge, doe fill the Earth and ayre with worthie prayse; your rare exploytes, which of your vertue springes, on Fames horse are spredd abroad allwaies, since you haue slayne, by great advice and skill, those English Chimers which this land did fill. (29) Pleasures to be eschewed. ffonde Paris, in vnbridled age doth chuse the life which seldom sorteth to good ende; ffor in yonge yeares, whoe vertue doth refuse, and doth on fading pleasures still attende, can neither witt, nor wealth, nor honnor, gayne, nor happie life in worldlie cares attayne. He chose Venus, which ‚Äòmadnes‚Äô is expounded, and ‚Äòwanton life of pleasures‚Äô doth expresse; he left Pallas, on which is rightlie grounded the contemplation of all perfectnes; he scorn'd Iuno, which ‚Äòwealth‚Äô doth signifie, with thactive life meane that to multiplie. Then shonne delight, yf riches thow doe craue, Or perfect wisdome thow do seeke to haue. (30) Vnitinge of Contraries make sound Iudgement. Comforting Ceres Ioynd with hopps of bitter taste, and faire waters, by art produce sweet liquors at the last, not much inferior to Bacchus pleasant wyne, as Emulus vnto that Ioyce which art doth well refine; for the sharpe taste of hopps, the water and the corne doe mittigate, and make that sweet, which bitter was beforne: which doth vs teach the waye, ech cause to handle well, and howe in knotted difficults a Iudgement right to tell; for Ioyning contraries in peyse of equall weighte, comparinge the effects of both, the truth appeareth straite, So addinge hard to softe, and bitter to the sweete, compounds a meane between them both, for Iudgment allwaies meet. (31) Reuenge. Dianiane dogge, with blinde furie inflamed, fearinge the hurled stone which him offended, with sharpe and threatning teeth whollie inraged, doth bite the stone, on that to be revenged, Iudginge noe other thinge but that dead stone, of that his hurt, to bee the cause alone. which fonde revenge doth others mirth provoke, vnto himself much greatur hurte increasinge, for guiltlesse stone cann never feele the stroke, allthough the dogg cease not his cruell bitinge. wherbye wee learne, not rashe reveng to take, of that which of it self noe hurt doth make; ffor not the stone, but flinginge hande, the iust revenge doth crave, and actors, not the instruments, due punishement should haue, Since to our selves more further paynes of greife wee shall procure, yf rashe revenge, on guiltlesse cause, wee striue to put in vre. (32) Peace. Pluto, the god of worldlie wealth, which vnder yearth doth houlde his goulden limittes and his bounds, with manie hills of goulde, there governs at his cursed will, and goulden guiftes greate store, with heaped Riches doth possesse a thowsand fould and more. vnder whose feete, Bellona lies, still thirstinge after warrs, a furious spoyler, and the cause of all tumultuous Iarrs. But fayre sweet Peace doth lead Pluto, and draweth him with right hand, And in lefte hand, Amalthea, the fruitfull horne, doth stande; ffor all thinges doe then flowe at large; Bacchus and Ceres raigne; Then Halcyon daies, then quiet rest, their triumphes doth retaine. Then blodie Mars, cast to the grounde, to peace doth yeald his sword; but perfect peace descends from him Which was his fathers worde, And first appeased the Angrie god when hee, the loste mankinde with peacefull concord, to our good, for evermore did bynde. (33) Pouertie. As fishe Remora staies the Shipp, which ells with prosperous wynde Would sayle vnto the port of rest, sweete comfort for to finde, Soe hated povertie, with greife of fortunes hard disgrace, The Labors of the vertuous minde doth vtterlie deface: ffor none soe noble vertue doth dwell in anie wight, but want obscures it, forcing him to silence with dispight. (34) Syluer worlde. The sacred Crowne adorning curled hayre, and christall hand welding the kinglie mace, the mounting Eagle which Ganimede did beare, are ensignes of the mightie Ioue his grace. All which doe shewe the sylver world fore past, when Cuntrey Swayne prepared the happie soyle, and with his seede the Earth did overcaste, which yoked oxe did teare vp with his toyle. Before which tyme the fertyle earth gaue out her blessed frute, thoughe she vntilled laye, And Saturne grave, the world did rule about, the goulden age which did to vs bewraye; But when that Ioue begann his Silver raigne, and had expelde his father from his lande, the feildes were tylld with greate &amp; sweating payne, and Wearied Oxe and horse, did mourning stand. (35) Enuye. The mightie Ioue from highest heaven did sende the fayer Ph≈ìbus, these gratefull newes to tell to wicked virginns, in vice which did excell, this greate favour that hee to them would lende, That for herself, what anie one did crave of him, her fellowe, duble that should haue. fforthwith, the monster vilde of all mankinde, which gnawes her harte, and teares our worthie fame, stepte forth and said, ‚ÄòApollo, graunt this same, that I one eye maye losse! for soe I finde my fellowe shall loose her twoe eyes and sight.‚Äô all which she spake through envie and despight. Thus fretting envie, Ioyeng in our payne, pininge her self when good to vs doth growe, and fatting fast when hurte or losse doth flowe, in all mischeif findinge her chefest gayne, of her own hurte, nothing doth force at all, yf double that vnto her neighbour fall. (36) Our terme or limit of life not remoueable. ffrom neck it hath the humane shape, the rest a piller stone: Thus Terminus the god is made, of all the godds alone; Whome, when the ruler of the starrs beheld with scornefull face, Hee willd him to depart the feilde, and leaue to him the place. But Terminus, all confident, did bouldlie to him saye, ‚ÄòI yeald to none‚Äô: the septred Ioue could not drive him awaye. Hee standeth fixte, not to be moved, whome wee cannot intreate with price, nor prayer, with wordes, nor giftes, nor yet with angrie threate. Soe are the fixed bonds which god doth limit to our daies, not to be changed or removed, to lengthe them anie waies. (37) God slowlie punisheth. What doth the waightie millstone meane, not turned by the wynde? Of heavenly god it signifies the nature and the kynde. The father of celestiall sprites, of mortall menn the Kinge, His thunder bolts doth rarelie shoote, or lightnings downe doth flinge. With slowe and stealinge pace, the wrath of god doth on vs fall, As one which gentlie doth expect that wee for mercye call. But when continnued patience doth breake his former bande, His anger is to furie turnd, he strikes with heavie hande; and with iust doblinge of the payne, the grevous punishment doth recompence the long delaye, vnlesse wee doe repent. ffor as millstone, once forct to turne by rage of boystrous winde, without regard, eche subiect thinge doth into powder grynde,‚Äî Soe clemencie of god, once broke by our continuall sinne, Doth vs torment with greater yre, our sowles therbye to winne. (38) Dull witts. The cheife of gods, the mightie Ioue, conceived in his brayne, And in newe sort did beare a childe, yf Poets trulye fayne. But when that wonderfull burthen, to worlde he could not leaue, The fierie god, the lame Vulcan, with Axe his hed did cleave. Then Armed Pallas lepped forth, true wisdome by her kinde, for not of fleshe doth wisdome growe, but of the precious minde; ffor triple power of heavenlie minde, which in the brayne doth dwell, doth make vs like the triple god, in wisdome to excell. Some kinde of men there are, whose witt soe pore wee often see, As, but with payne and longe dayes toyle, naughte will engendered bee; ffrom whome their wisdome must be drawen (since they want learned speeche) As Pallas was from Ioue his hedd, as doth this Embleme teache. (39) The wretched not to be Doblie greiued. The birde of Ioue, the Eagle of flight most free, with manye bites, the naked hart doth teare, of wretch Prometheus, hanging on the tree, which for our skill doth this good lesson beare: In this sorte not to vexe with doble greefe A wretched mann deprived of releefe, But rather showld, with words of myledest kinde, a plaister give, to cure his greevous wound; for to the same, sweet pittie doth vs bynde, Since in godds nature dailie that is found, and his preeceptes, in tables graven in stone, gives vs in charge, the wretched to be none. ffor hee whose tender hart with pittie dighte vnto the sicke doth reache his helpinge ayde, and partner of the waight of burdened wighte doth ease his payne when hee is overlayed, Amongst the heavenlie Saints shall firmelie gayne A memorable name, still to remayne. (40) Noe impuritie in heauen. The blinded boye, which with his peircinge darts and tender stroke, the heavenlie godds did wound, felt greate delight to scorche their pliant harts, since fellowe like amongst them he was found; but when both sexes of gods did feele such blowe, oft times greate warrs amongst themselvs did growe. Then prudent Ioue, seinge that fyerie broyle to rise by weapons which Cupido bare, fearinge the godds would one annother spoyle, the bowes and shaftes from Cupids backe he tare; and with greate reason, for that boyes disgrace, did throwe him downe from out that sacred place; ffor the first father which hath made the skye must keepe the heavenlie feilds most cleane &amp; pure; Soe Lucifer, the prowde, clyming on hye, was caste from heaven, in hell for to indure; for naught vncleane, as sacred letters tell, in this most holie Cittie once may dwell. (41) Honor and rewarde nourisheth artes. Shewe mee, sweete muse, why thow and all the rest which heavenlie spheres doe guide with harmonie, were fostred vp with milke from Christall brest of Euphemen distillinge plenteouslie. Our nurce, her name doth well the same vnfold, yf wiselie thow the sence therof dost knowe, for Euphemen, none other thinge doth hould, but this which from that greekishe man doth flowe. Since Euphemen doth onelie signifie good fame, good name, a good report &amp; prayse, true honour, due reward, and perfect glorie, which nourishe Artes, and learned men allwaies. ffor without that, who, learning would applie, or weare himself with paine &amp; miserie? (42) Eloquence. Some Learned menn affirme by abstruce skill that Proteus, god and author of eche thinge, who into severall formes, at his owne will, oft turnd him self, as did occasion springe, exprest a man, which fullie could expounde ech severall thinge which was in nature founde. Some sayed he was a man of pretious witt, and greatlie skilld in kinglie government; for they which at the Helme of state doth sitt, must see wherto their subiects most are bent, and turne him self into eche severall minde, yf calmed realme he wishe, or hope to finde. But I this Proteus severall formes doe deeme, the force of Eloquence for to vnfould; for as he oft did make his shape to seeme a beast, a fowle, greene earth, or water cowlde, Soe devyne Eloquence, mens mindes doth change, Even as it lists, to like of thinges most straunge. (43) Art cannot take awaye the vice of nature. The healthfull bathe which daielie wee doe see to cure the sores and fleshe of lothsome skinn, cann never make the Negro white to bee, or clense the harlot from her loathed sinne, ffor such defaults as nature dothe committ in the outward shape which she doth vs impart, or such defaults as growe by minde or witt cannot be cured by anie outward art; ffor though a time wee bridle natures strength, She will break forth, and houlde her course at length. (44) Fortune. As goulden Sonne doth worke from out the Skye divers effectes, and those exceedinge straunge, Soe wandringe fortune, by incertaintie, workes her effectes with sundrie kindes of change. ffor somm she doth oppresse with miserie, ffrom dunghill, raysinge some to heapes of gould Some she castes downe from great nobilitie, and makes a clowne a noble place to hould. Shee gives Kingdomes, shee takes them backe againe, her wheele still turnes, not havinge anie staye; she subvertes all, even as she please to fayne; and as with ball, soe with the world doth playe. In honnors Chaire, then see that thow sitt faste, Least with her checke shee mate thee at the laste. (45) Ganymede. Yea, impure mindes whom vncleane lusts defile against the rightfull course of natures kinde, which perverslie your pleasant witts beguile, with Ioue his loue, which Ganymede did finde, deme that sweet fayre which forct the godds to love, was sacred, and noe common lust did prove. which Ganimede his name doth well expresse; for that, a prudent mann, doth signifie, who doth his minde to Heavenlie things addresse, and flies to Heaven by livinge vertuouslie, then which, on earth, nought cann be fairer founde, causinge goddes love to vs for to abounde. Then with true wisdome see godds favour thow deserve, In goulden cupp, with heavenlie drinke of Nectar, him to serve. (46) Eloquent wisdome. The talking byrd, which gloriously is cladd By natures guise in robe of Emeraud greene, And Tyryan feathers gorgious to be seene, with humane tongue and voice which art doth add, of eloquent mann the worthie Tipe is hadd, Such one as Tullie sayes he never found, thoughe in sweet speech learn'd oratours abounde. The Sea Tortoys, his howse which beares on back, foure footed, shell clothed, and of fearefull sounde, short hedded, Snake necked, without bowells fownde, of hideous sight, and which warm blood doth lack, whose Armor naught can peirce, of pase most slack, true wisdomes signe doth vnto vs present, And stayed minde to perfect wisdome bent. Our Parrot then, vpon this Tortoys plac'de, to vs doth note, by Egiptian misterie, the sound effect of wisdomes veritie, with Mercuries flowing tongue most swetelie grac'd, which Ioynd in one, can never be defac'd; wherof a truer mirror none maye knowe then you, in whome such famous guiftes doe flowe: Then live in hapie health, since Mercuries worthie Arte, And learn'd Mineruas skill, doth harbour in your harte. (47) Poetrye. The artificiall Scale composd of gould, the shyning mettall to Phebus consecrate, doth fayre imprint the figure he doth hould in plyant waxe, to secrecie dedicate; that wax, transforming to his forme aright, a gladsome pleasure to a Curious sight. And golden Poet fedd with Appollos muse, by his Emphatick verse of heavenlie kinde, such charming power in reader doth infuse, and grave such passions in his pliant mynde, that he is metamorphos'd with delight into the autors secret thoughts and sprighte; ffor why, such enargye and life doth in learn'd verse abound, That sence, and witt, and hart, it doth both ravishe and confounde. (48) Ensignes of the Clergye. Thow doest demaund of me, why this right hand doth houlde the slipperie Ele, which turnes himself in circle manifoulde; And whye the guelye arme in midst of Sheild is placed, Of Asured cullour, whose bright shine the firmament hath graced. The blewishe Scuttchion doth present the vawted Skye, Deenotinge that the spirituall man should love the things on hye. The reddishe cullor doth declare the modest shame which in his countenance should dwell, a vertuous life to frame. The Ele prest with the hand, doth teach him to refrayne His lipps and tongue from vttring wordes deceiptfull, false, or vayne. This must the learned Clarke allwaies record in mynde, yf of Saluation, care he haue, or comfort hope to finde; ffor as the slipprye Ele not prest, doth slide awaye, So doth the slipprye tongue, the thoughts of inward minde bewraye. The white cullor of Ele declares that all his deedes Should be white, pure, and Innocent, which from his hart proceedes. Thus yf he frame his life, imbraced still is hee Of godd and of the world, to which he shall example bee. (49) Flatterers. There is a kinde of men, whome hell hath bredd, Deceit hath nourc'd, and doble speech hath fedd; naked of vertue, and impudent of face, abhord of all, exilde from everie place, ffalse flatterers nam'd, themselves which change to every fashion, though never soe strange. These doth the fishe Polipus represent, in his conditions which be impudent, Turning his cullor to everie kinde of Hue, of everie obiect offerd to his viewe, wherbye he maye, with bayt of cloked change, deceyve the fishe which in the deepe do range, Therbye more lightlie for to winn his praye, to gorge his gluttenous mawe with foode allwaye. Soe the false Parisites themselves doe wynde to divers formes, as tyme and place they fynde, Changinge themselves to ech mans severall vayne, foode, wealth, or clothinge, therbye to attayne, Deceyvinge such as in them put their trust, paynelesse to serve their Hungrye mawe &amp; lust, and without labour to releeve their need, worse then the Crowes on carrion which doe feed, for they, dead bodies onlie doe devoure, when these, the livinge doe consume ech hower. (50) Our betters or enemies not to be prouoked with wordes. Strymonian Cranes, which by their ayerie flight preserv'd the wise Deucalion from the flood, are taught by natures beneficiall lighte to seek helping art for their better good; for which, when they crosse frozen Taurus hill, ech one, a stone doth carrie in his bill, wherby they stopp the lowde voice of their crye, leaste when they passe that huge and ragged mounteyne, The Queene of birdes, their foe, should them discrie, and their voyce make them praye to Iove his swayne; but having overgone that dangerous place, they leave those stones, and forth direct their pace. Soe men, whome art and nature doth adorne, should silent be, for feare of followinge hate, and not with wordes, their betters for to scorne, or ells their foes by tongue to Irritate. for gentle speech, or silence, at the length doth swage or keepe vs from our Ennemies strength, which over pas'd, wee maie with courage bould keepe on the course of life wee meane to hould. (51) Wisdome and Strength are to be Ioyned. Doe tell, rude verse, why that pure virginn fayre, borne of Ioues brayne by helpe of Vulcans skill, came armed forth into the Shining ayre, not borne of Humane fleshe by natures will, but whole begott of heavenlie seede and light, being Pallas and Minerua call'd by right. It shewes that wisdome doth from good discend, not borne of fleshe, nor bredd of Earthlie kinde. that shee came armed forth, it doth pretende that wisdome without strength is but a wynde; and strength without wisdome, subversion brings, but Ioyn'd in one, doe conquer hardest thinges. (52) The meane. The Daulian Philomell, whose warblinge voice descants the musick of natures sweete delight, in her self notes soe greatlie doth reioyce, that with the same she putts her life to flight, soe swetelie yealdes this nightingale her sprite; And vegitive plantes, watered with the meane, doe springe; but overmuch, doe wither cleane. Soe the excesse in everie Earthlie thinge, and the extreame in everie fadinge kinde, vncured hurt vnto it self doth bringe, and extreame greife vnloked for doth finde; ffor learned Flaccus putts vs still in minde that witt is follie, and right iniustice named, and vertue vice, beyond the meane once framed. (53) Not to climbe ouer highe. Bellerephon, which ruld without offence, whome fretting envie could not make to yealde, nor Pretus wife to incest could incense, nor triple monster force to flie the feilde, Did once ascend to his immortall fame, the horse of honnor stabled in the skye; but not of power, that vntam'd beaste to tame, hedlonge is throwne to ground most worthilie. Then thow which doste highe dignities attayne, and clothed art with honnors purple gowne, aspire not higher, least to thy bitter payne, with extreame shame thow hedlonge tumble downe, By fall, pervertinge former good for which thow hast byn praysed, And blemishing those worthie partes which thee to honnor raysed. (54) Monument of a harlott. Whose tombe is this? whose bones doth this contayne? the Ephereian Lais here doth lie, whose peerelesse bewtie, wanton Greece did stayne with her highe prys'd excessive Lecherie; but wo, alas! sham'd not their destinie to cut her fatall thred which was soe faire, to whome to Corinth all men did repayre. No, she was with crooked age foreworne, her frowinced face her bewtie had defac'd, And like a woman which weare all forlorne, and that of Venus nowe noe more was grac'd, her christall glasse on Venus wall she placed, as lothinge in that mirror for to prye, her wrinkled eyes and cheekes for to espie. Vppon whose curious tombe, engraven by skill, did stand a feirce and cruell Lyonesse, which did the simple Ram, even at her will, hould by the Loynes with clawes of bludinesse; which vnto vs this morrall did expresse, that by the Loynes she still did hould and keepe her fonde lovers, as Lyonesse doth the Sheepe. (55) Earthlie mindes. The statelie Stagg, whose hornes threaten the skye, is sencelesse dombe, not hearinge anie sounde of hungrie dogges that seekes him eagerlie, or hunters voice which doth in woodes rebounde, whilst hee with grynding teeth feedes on the ground, except he first his hed from Earth erect, wherby the hearinge sence maye them detect. Soe mortall men, full fraught with worldlie toyes, whose earthlie mynde, howsd in such brutish wight, (beastlie feeding on fleshlie fadinge Ioyes,) cannot conceive the words of heavenlie spright, nor heare the gladsome voice of heavens delight, Leaste to the skye his hanging hed he raise, from earth of Sinn, and sowles corrupting waies. (56) The olde Testament. The Oke, bearing a corne, Ioues sacred tree, which, to wise Greekes, the Oracles did lend; the Ayerye spredding beech, whose arms wee see, frise clothed frut vnto the world doth sende; In former Ages, and Earths infancie, when eche Creature to natures lawe did bend, with their swete nourishing mast fedd plenteouslie our Auncient Syres, of other food deprived; But wee, through Goddesse Ceres helpe revived, comforting corne for Sustenance obteyne, A pleasant foode, more exellent by kinde. Soe nowe these trees noe needfull vse doe gayne, but that to shade and buildinges they are sign'd, which Moses lawe to vs doth signifie, that was but mast, as stifneckd Iewes maye finde, and shaddowes of the followinge veritie; for nowe the immortall sonne of deitie, Our Sauiour Christ, the autor of all good, with rare bountie doth give abundantlie his heavenlie corne to bee our dailie food; wherbye wee leaue that mast and Iewish meate, and hould that elder lawe confirm'd by blood of beastes, and which but shaddowes doth repeate, as figures onelie of Christes healthfull lore, which is the perfect meate, whose signe the Iewes did eate before. (57) Sophistrie. Saturns daughter, and Ioue his Iealious wife, Queene of Riches, pleasure of this life, the angrie Iuno by her queint device, self loving Syrens falslye did intyce in songe with the sweete muses to contend. these Syrens were, as autors doe pretend, faire virgings, which in squamous fishe did end, and fishe with virgins faces forth did send: Wemen lacking natures feete of righte, and fethered fowles wanting winges for flight, which, though nature denye soe to combyne, yet were they such as wee do here defyne, conteyned in the holie number three, whose names, significant are knowen to bee: Parthenos virginn, with sweete Ligia, and the most daintie white Leucosia, who doth in false bewitching tunes excell, wherby they sacred muses did compell with them to singe, victorious crowne to gayne; which learned muses did at first disdayne, all though at length they yealded full consent, and to their witlesse challeng did relent; when with their shrill and most celestiall sound, those prowde Syrens they easilie did confound, by iustice lawe; for whoe maye well compare the muses musick naturall and rare, to the deceitfull Captious Syrens skill, with which they all lascivious eares doe fill? The muses then, full victors in the feilde, vnplum'd those Syrens whome they forct to yeald, and from them all their glorious fethers take, wherof triumphant crownes they dulie make; which mithologians thus doe moralize: the muses, note the doctrine of the wise, and perfect wisdome, which victoriouslie triumphes on crag'd deceitfull Sophistrie, which by false Syrens we doe signifie, for what ells doe their fethers notifie, but foolishe words, wanting true reasons ground, which light, like fethers toste in wynde, are founde? these doth true wisdome overthrowe in Scorne, and with faire crowne therof, her hedd adorne. (58) Ingratitude. The stam'ringe Cuckooe, whose lewd voice doth greeve the daintie eares with her fowle note dismay'd, In the Currucas neste doth her releeve, Suckinge the Egges which that heysuge hath laid; in lue wherof, her owne egg she doth leave, wherbye she doth the gentle bird deceyve. Which that simple heysuge findinge in place (pore sillie foole, not knowinge of this guile), doth lovinglie nourishe with moothers grace, hatchinge those Egges that did her bed defile, by dailie food them fostring, as they were of her owne kinde, and her true forme did beare. But these vile bastards, as they growe in strength, and fethered are with winges of trecherie, their nource and moother doe assault at length, with thankles mouth tearing her cruellie, till peecemeale they devoure ech severall part, and suck the blood of their dames loving hart. Soe, wicked menn, the bastards of mankinde, whome neither love nor reasonn cann alure, whome others great rewards, to them should bynde, because their life is nourished by their cure, Acteons curres, and thanklesse menn doe prove, wounding their patrons whome they ought to loue. (59) Children in youth to be framed. In yongest yeares, when will and strength doe want, doe frame the child like to the growinge plant, which yonge and tender thow maist wrye and bende vnto what forme thy fancie shall intende; but once a tree, and growen to height of strength, noe force cann make him bowe or bend at length. (60) Of the same. As tender whelpe, whome natures skill hath taught by her instinct to hunt and chuse the game, to his perfection never yet is broughte, nor for to doe his maisters will can frame, till first his tutor, crosse his necke doe tye a litle bat, to frame his whelpe therbye. ffor that Invres and teacheth him, to beare the Yoke in youth, which age would not Indure, and doth compell him to obedient feare, which in his age he never should procure. in youth then, hange about the child his neck the staffe of feare, his stubbornes to check; Soe he shall learne, in age for to obaye, In youth that first was taught the readie waye. (61) Benefitts. The silver Moone, Diana Virgine bright, on mortall creatours powred her moystening light, wherwith she doth adorne the Sable nighte, whose sleepinge mantle dimms the peircinge sight; which gladsome shine she takes abundantlie from her beloved spowse, who favourablie doth spredd his goulden beames most liberallie on that faire Phebee full of curtesie. Thus, like the liberall moone, wee should bestowe the bennefitts which from highe Ioue doe flowe vnto vs mortall creatures here belowe, vpon our neighbours, whome wee needie knowe, ffor soe the beneficiall heavens doe teach vs by their kynde, whose comfortable vertues, wee doe by their influence finde. (62) Prodigalitie. The craftie ffox, with longe and bushye tayle, doth allwaies clense and sweepe the durtie soyle, wherat the mockinge Ape begann to Rayle, for that his heavie tayle was clogging toyle and in his chase did put him oft to foyle, when he was quick, and nimblie, clym'd ech tree, as being taylesse, lighter for to bee. But scoffers must rescoffed be againe; for subtile fox, with answer soone replied, and rightlie said it was noe heavie payne to beare those thinges which nature did provide, our open shame, and fowle mishapes, to hyde; for better was, to cover secretlie the hinder partes, then shewe them lothsomlie. Thus did the foxe the truer cause defende, since much better are superfluities which vs adorne, and profitt doe pretende, then want of thinges to hide deformities. So prodigall men, with their extremities, ffarr better are in spending lavishlie, then he that wants to serve necessitie. And witlesse vnthriftes, which superfluouslie do spende, Doe much more good then such as hordinge do attende. (63) To Mr Thomas Valence. My Valence, to thy learned vewe this skillesse vers I sende, the fruit of my well wishing hart, and guifte of faythfull frende; doe take it with like lovinge minde, to aunswer my desart, whome frowninge fortune hath denied a better to imparte. The frutefull bough of sacred Olive, the braunch of peacefull tree, the leaves of oylie healthful frute that allwaies greene wilbe; Which never lose their naturall shewe, whose leaves doe never fall, ffor which the Romans in lesse triumphes were crowned therwithall, As were the troopes of valiant knightes, because this holie tree, To warlike Pallas consecrate ys allwaies found to bee; vpon which sacred florishinge bough I offer to thine eyes A gentle Swarme of Wittie Bees and honnie bearinge flies, By which, as former learned menn did vnto vs present, Prosperitie of dailie health, and minde to quiet bent; So by the same I wishe to thee like health and quiet minde, with good successe, wherby thow mayest perpetuall comfort finde; Like Olive never to decaye, but allwaies freshe to springe, In peace of minde, in peace of tyme, Eternall peace to bringe; ffor yf we warr within our selves, distract with everie thought, Desired health doth still decaye, Sicknes is dailie wrought. Then to this peace and quiet rest is Ioyn'd sweete nutriment, ffor whoe delights in bitter foode, to shorter life is bent; ffor that our Auncient fathers ment, by addinge to this tree Dedalan bees, bright Phebus babes, which good phisitions bee. Since from the Olive, oyle distills, the Bees sweet honie give, both which, the weake and feble parts with comfort do releeve. ‚ÄòAnd who, longe life,‚Äô saies Democrite, ‚Äòwould winne for payne and toyle, must moyst his inward parts with honnie, and outward parts with oyle.‚Äô So shall continuall prosperous health, longe life for vs obtayne, which as before, soe nowe to thee, I freindlie wishe againe. (64) Strangers more freindlie to vs then our owne kinde and kindred. My loved frend, and lovinge therwithall, the same even nowe which former tymes did finde, against true freindshipps bande, howe maye it fall that I should shewe my self soe farr vnkinde, as to lett slipp our frendship out of minde? wherfore this Embleme, which I frendlie ment, take with like love as I the same present. The pretie youth, Telemachus the fayre, the pledge most deere to Vlisses eloquent, and chaste Penelope, which with despaire did feed her hungrie sutors hote intent, and never would to theire desire relent, did fall from crooked shore, sitting at ease, into the raveninge wombe of raging Seas. fforthwith, full fraught with love and pietie, the Arionian Dolphins were at hand, whose gentle barks receyv'd him lovinglie, and from the deepe restored him to land, Savinge his life; wherbye wee vnderstand, That straungers to our kinde and to our bloode, then our owne kinde and kinn, do vs more good, And that th' vntamed Seas breed fishe of better kinde, Then pleasant Earth doth yealde vs menn of lovinge minde.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Epigramms. (1) The Armes of England. The sacred Lyon of Iudeas princelie lyne, which weldes the scepter of the glorious skye, of Iesses roote the flowers most divine, whose heavenlie smell feedes our mortallitie, protect (moste worthie Queene) from all annoye Thy Realme, thy Lyons, and thy flowers of Ioye. (2) Crisopeia. My dolefull muse, bewayle in mournefull rimes, with sighinge penn, with Inke of deepe lament, the bitter galls of our vnhappie times, and pore estate of those to vertue bent; for he whome vertue hath to honnor raised, treades downe all those which are for vertue praised. O Sea of sorrowe! wherin wee sayle with greife, O gulfe of greife! wherin wee drowne with payne, since vertue cannot finde her due releeife, but to faire Crisopeia shee retayne, whoe sotts him soe with her bewitchinge sight, that but she speake, vertue doth loose her right. Ye noble mindes, reiect your worthie partes, let valour sleepe, your Heroike deedes will fayle; ye sacred witts with your celestiall artes, despise ech muse, science will not prevaile; ffor neither Mars, nor sweet Mineruas quill, cann reape reward in his longe practised skill. Then woe to vertue! woe our miscreant daies! thrice woe to them whome vertue doth adorne! faire Crisopeia with her goulden Rayes, ech wight of worth doth taunt with bitinge scorne, for vertue looseth what she well deserveth, hee onelie gaines, who Crisopeia serueth. without her bewtie, none maie favour praye; without her meane, all labour is in vaine; vertue, stand back, vnles shee make the waie; valour and learninge, give place vnto her trayne. thus, muse, far well thow seest thy fatall ende, faire Crisopeia will not bee thy frende. (3) Vpon the armed Statue of Venus. ffayre Venus, tell whye dost thow Armor beare, and cloggs thy self with heavie Coate of Steele; thow art not Mars, thoughe his attire thow weare, nor warlick broyles thow ever yet didst feele; sweet speech, good lookes, allurements of delight, are weapons servinge better for thy fight. In vaine, therfore, thus feircelie art thow armed, for natures harnesse best beseemes thy kinde; with blowdie weapons why shouldest thow be charmed, wherin small comfort thow dost ever finde? for naked and vnarm'd, with bewties sheilde thow madest the god of battell for to yeilde. (4) Sundrie and strange effectes of wyne. The drunken menn, whome gluttonie doth fill with wynes excesse, doe sundrie passions houlde: the one lookes highe, and will not be controlde; one other singes with loftie voice and shrill; one other mournes, shedding teares manifolde; with blasphemie, some one his sowle doth kill. Somme one, with stretched hands to god doth praye; one, as his humor is, seekes peace to make; one other, noe man for his frend doth take; one nimblie dances, or ells doth skipp and playe; somme, verses write, for their swete Ladies sake, and summ for hast doe often loose their waye. Summ cannot speake, sum stammer at ech worde, summ whoope and hallowe, and braye with open throte; summ, filthie talke doe vse in bawdries note; one doth dispute till hee laye vnder borde; mongst brambells summ runn, till they teare there coate, summ frett and fume, and naught but blowes afford. One falls to Lecherous actes, like beaste, past shame; annother cannot hould himself from sleepe; summ other rowles his eyes like mased sheepe; summ finde greate faultes, and others moe doe blame; somme, for his life cannot his counsell keepe, and somm backbite all others with defame. One, as he goeth, endenteth with his feete; one gapes and yawnes, stretchinge his slothfull arme; one thinkes he is a witch, and straight doth charme; one other scoffes at ech whome he doth meete; one other spues out right, but thinkes noe harme; and some therebye with death and sicknes meete. which severall force, in wyne is never founde, for simplie of it self it works noe ill, but shewes what humors doth the person fill, and what conceites doe in his braines abounde yf hee doe gorge it in at his owne will, vntemperatlie his sences for to wounde. Then yf thy self thow wilt not once bewraye, Shonn wynes excesse, which takes thy witts awaye. (5) Contemninge. Whoe doeth contempne the worlds fond vanitie, whoe doth contempne that fleshly part of his, whoe doth contempne no man in miserie, and doth contempne that hee contempned is: by these contemptes shall make himself regarded, and at the last with heavenlie Ioyes rewarded. whoe doth contempne religion and her sawes, whoe doth contempne correction of his will, whoe doth contempne the prince, the crowne, the lawes, and doth contempne the helpe of learned skill: by these contemptes, to his reproche doth gaine hate, shame, and greife, with everlastinge payne. (6) What maketh menn forgett themselues. Alluring bewtie, with her cristall face, the heate of youth enflaminge loftie minde, the favour of the people, and their grace, the greate presumption of the strength wee find, the store of wealth, the pride of hawtie harte, and swelling skill of learning and of arte, The Princes love (protecting of our will), the stubborne furie of disturbed brayne, eager desire for to revenge our will, and fretting envie with scornefull disdaine, makes vs forgett our selves, and takes awaye sweet reasons vse, our onelie helpe &amp; staye. (7) Thinges not to be recalled. The stone once cast out of the hand or slinge, the tyme once past consuming everie thinge, the foolishe wordes which throughe the lipps doe flie, the broken Hymen of virginitie, by witt, by art, by pleasure, or by paine, cannot returne, or ells be calld againe. then well foresee, before thy hand doe ought, spend not the goulden tyme on things of naught, premeditate before thow speake in haste, doe keepe thy bodie allwaies cleane and chaste; Soe shalt thow live free from the worlds distresse, and in thy self thy self full well possesse. (8) The vnapt not to be forced to learninge. To Salamanca yf thow send an Asse, to Oxford, Cambridge, Paris, or dowaye, [Douai] or that by travell to farthest lands hee passe, or in the princes Court longe tyme doe staye: yf, when he went, he were an Asse, noe art will make him horse, for felde, for waie, for cart. Then spare your cost, yf nature give not witt, to send your sonns vnto the learned scooles, for to the same, yf nature make not fitt, doe what you cann, they still shall prove but fooles; then tourne ech witt to that which nature will, els fondlie thow thy sonne and cost dost spill. (9) The waye to gett and keepe frendes. ffyne witts, much art, sweet tongues, and flatterie, doe gaine and keepe vs frendes, as some men saye; but these are vaine, as proofe doth testifie, without large giftes, which makes the readie waye; for though that Homer come with learned hande, yf naught he give, without dores maie he stande. This then must be the surest grounde, I finde, to winn and hould such frends as wee desire: first give thow much, be plyant to their minde, take naught of others, fewe thinges doe thow require, which if with heed thow wiselie dost retayne, a heape of frends thow worthilie shalt gayne. Wee all doe love to take, as Ioue doth teach, which dailie guiftes and sacrifice doth crave; Nonn loue to give, but such as cannot reach the full effect of that which they would haue; trust Ouid then, whoe spake what he did knowe: it shewes great witt, large giftes for to bestowe. (10) Of Stumblinge. The prowde horse that treades with statelie pace, and champes his foming mouth on goulden bitt, adorn'd with curious trapping and pleasant grace, of his braue looke his humor for to fitt, with his fower feet, when hee doth prance and playe, stumbles and falls in Iourneyeng of the waye. What marvayle then, though worldlie men and proude, adorn'd with sacred reason of the minde, In whome the heavens and earth themselves doe shrowd, with his twoo feet, as nature hath assign'd, In Iournyeng to the place of heavenlie Ioye, doth fall and stumble, through the worlds annoye! (11) First guestes at a feaste. The buzzinge flye which falls in everie thinge, the meger dogg that hopes to gorge his mawe, the wandring mynstrell, redie for to singe, the roaging beggar living without lawe, the Parasite smell-feast, which newes doth bringe, and cares not whome his flattring tongue doth stinge, allthough vnbidd, like vnto shameles beastes, with hast come first vnto all solempne feastes. (12) When a wife is badd, worse, and worst. When she is good, better, and beste. My frend, yf that my Iudgement do not fayle, as one well taught by longe experience skill, thy wife allwaies is but a needefull ill, and beste is bad, thoughe faire she beare her saile, but vs'd not well, she worser is to thee, but worst of all when best she seemes to bee. Thy wife is good when shee forsakes this light, and yealdes by force to natures destinie, she better is (thowe livinge) yf she die, but best when shee doth soonest take her flight, for soe to thee thine ease shee doth restore, which soonest hadd, doth comforte thee the more. (13) A Puritane. Dame Lais is a puritane by religion, Impure in her deedes, though puer in her talke, And therefore a puritane by condition, or pluritane, which after manie doth walke; for pruritie of wemenn, by lecherous direction, seekes pluritie of men to worke satisfaction. (14) Of heauie and light. Philosophers were fooles, that taught of ould that naught cann worke his natures contrarie, Since experience (best proofe) hath them controld, that heavie makes light, and light makes heavie; for a light purse makes a heavie harte, wee finde, and heavie purse doth make light hart and minde. (15) Waterhowse. With milder sport, and not with bitter speech, licence me here with thee somewhat to playe. doe take it well, I frendlie thee beesech, I thinke but mirth what soe my penn bewraye, not meaning the t'offend in anie waye, vpon thy name, allthough my penn do straye. for since with Bacchus Iuice thine inward part is dailie moystened, for thine owne delighte, and that the blood of Earth revives thy hart, clensinge thy sowles howse both daie and night, thow rather ‚Äòwynehowse,‚Äô for thy livelie spright, then ‚Äòwaterhowse,‚Äô shouldst termed be of right. (16) A preist which knewe not anie letter. Good zealous preist, thy hart more than thy skill, thy zeale more than thy learning or thy witt, the sacred eares of mightie Ioue must fill, or ells for god thow wilt be nothing fitt. Of holie Pawle, yet thow the heavenlie voice cannst ringe alowd, and sound this sentence true, ‚Äòthe Letter kills,‚Äô wherby thow maiest reioyce, that of one Letter the forme thow never knewe. ffor least that this deade letter should thee kill, thow didst beware the letters for to learne, and that aptlie, since of godds holie will the quickning spirrit thow never couldst deserne. (17) The hedd and the tayle. Great was the glorious fame, most worthie knight, stout Perseus, when with thy warlike knife thow strakest of the monsters hedd, in sighte of vglie Gorgon, then bereav'd of life; but farr more famous should haue byn thy glorie yf thow hadst cutt of the tayles of the Clergie. (18) Cause of a deere yeare. Thow fondlie askest me, as though I were a god, what causeth this continued dearth, and plague of Iove his rod. yf I the truth maie tell, although it purchase blame, I will not spare to speake my thought, but yet to thy defame: Th'inseasonable yeare, this dearth doth not procure, nor the discurtesie of heaven, which thus wee doe Indure, nor Saturns cursed starr, nor barraynesse of land, nor want of heedie carefullnes of things wee haue in hand, nor Ioue his iust anger powr'd out on mortall wightes for these our manie heaped sinns, and for the fleshe delights; but thow dost plague vs all, and force vs for to die, through murdring death, and famins rage, by thy extremitie; for since the greedie mawes of thee, thy sonns and kinne, cann never well be satisfied with that they dailie winn, but that they horde, they scrape and gripe all that they maie, to sett them selves in highe estate by everie manns decaye, devouring all the paynes which others doe imploye, howe maie it chuse, but derth and want, all others must destroye? (19) Pinkes. ffreind Meering, I deeme you smell verie sweete, that are soe full of Pinkes from hedd to the feete; Yet if everie Pinke of your hatt, doblet, and hose were decked with a garden Pinke to savour your nose, You might stand for a maye game, what so you do thinke; for thoughe the flowers were sweet, your follie wold stinke. (20) Shoinge. Good Browne, thow doest complaine with heavie cheere, the Shomaker shoes thee not to thy minde. the fault is not his, as it maie appeare, that with straite shoes thy foote hee doth bynde, for hee makes them small like thy foote in ech thinge, since, in shooing thee, hee must shooe a goslinge. (21) Glasses. The sundrie sort of glasses which art doth put in vre for our delights, in severall kindes, sweete pleasures doe procure: the daintie Ladies, loue in lookinge glasse to prye; the glasse perspective, is desyrd of learnd Pholosophie; greate states, their windowes deck with glasse, for their delight; the searchinge Chimists, for their art, haue glasses strange of sight; the burning glasse is made, a thinge of rare devise; and glasse vessells for banquettinge are dailie had in pryse; besides, there is of glasse a temple faire and brighte, which learned Chaucer builded hath with penn of heavenliespright; And gascoigne, for his sport, hath made a glasse in verse, wher wee maie see our owne defaults, which there he doth reherse; but all these curious glasses, or anie of like kinde, or other strange proportion which art or wealth maie finde, Cannot content my frende; hee hath them in disdayne, hee them reiects as frivolous, he houlds them all in vayne, for, of all sorts of glasse which give forth anie shine, my frend loves, euerie hower, to haue a venice glasse of wyne. (22) One assured he was elected. Thow greatlie bragst how that thow art assur'd thow art elected: Chaunge but one letter, and thow saiest true, because thow art eiected. ffor, knocking at the heavenlie gate, to enter as right heire, Thow art repulsd as bastard childe, and driven to deepe despaire. (23) Cham. In all the course of thy vnhappie yeares, noe kinde of vertue in thy life appeares; ffor thow art Cham, or ells Chamms wicked brother: he did deride his father; and thow thy mother; his curse was greate; and soe will fall to thee, that scoffes at her which still should honnored bee. (24) Fayth. Our Saviour Christ, with words of greife complayned, that when he came to Iudge the world by fyer, that fayth should not be found to his desire, soe greatlie should the Christian fayth be strayned. but if he nowe the same would come to finde, he should see faythes more then stande with his minde; ffor greater and more faiths in yearth, with menn did not abounde, Soe contrarie, soe confident, soe pleasant to bee founde. (25) Cuttinge of tyme. The Curious gardiner, with his cruell Shires doth cutt the wholsome tyme, and her sweet flowers; which hee doth cutt soe longe, till tyme at length cuts of his life by doome of heavenlie powres, for tyme, in tyme cutts him with full despight, that first by tyme cutt tyme from his delight. (26) A tench and a wench. A Catholike and a Protestant were frendlie sett at meate, for both whose dinner was prepared, both fyshe and fleshe to eate. They both, as did their conscience bidd, feed on the severall dishe: The Protestant vpon the fleshe, the Papist on the fishe. At length the Catholike complaind, our wantoun times to bee disordered in everie thinge, as dailie hee did see: ‚Äòffor nowe our Protestants,‚Äô (said hee,) ‚Äòwhich newe Religion take, Twixt Pigg and Pike, twixt Carpe and Capon, not anie difference make.‚Äô To whome the other replied: ‚Äòwee make such difference of their kinde As Papists doe twixt tench and wench, to serve their wantoun minde.‚Äô (27) Whoe are happie. Antomedon the Greeke Poet doth tell, and rightlie, yf the same be wayed well, that firste he happie mann is sayed to bee, which oweth nought, and is from borrowinge free; Next, hee whome wedlocks fetters doth not strayne; the third, whome childrens cares did never payne. but if he bee soe madd to take a wife, to ridd himself from his most quiet life, yf shee be rich, and therwith soone to die, hee happie is, to gaine her wealth therbye. (28) Linguistes. Twoe gentlemen at meate by enterchaunge of frendlie speech, the tyme to entertayne, a womann did commend for vertues straunge, as one that too much learning did attaine, being a greate linguist, whych praise doth gaine; for of the tongues shee nothinge was to seeke, since she was skill'd in Hebrew and in Greeke. The other said, ‚Äúmarveyle not much that they such cuninge take, ffor nature, by a speciall grace, great linguists doth them make.‚Äù (29) Drinkinge. The first delightinge draught doth well thy Pallat please; The second doth thy hart comfort, and thy could stomake ease. The third doth make the pleasant wyne well knowne vnto thy skill; The fourth encreaseth suddaine mirth, and pleasure doth distill. The fifte the braine doth heate, throwout in everie parte; The sixte doth make the[e] verie learn'd and cunninge in ech art. The seaventh makes the[e] like [a] horse that runnes without a rayne; The eight, thy sences doth confound, and takes awaye thy brayne. The ninth doth make the[e] like a swyne to fyle the place; The tenth doth make thee worse then madd, and hated with disgrace. Then flye excesse of wyne, which is not worthie blame, ffor thow, not that, doste cause this ill, to thy perpetuall shame. (30) Enuye. Thow monster of mankinde, obscurer of good name, thow hated childe of pride, and autor of thy shame, whose heares are stinging snakes, whose face is pale &amp; wann, with scornfull eyes and browes, disdaining euerie mann, with canker taynted tethe, and poysoned tongue of spight, with vile detracting lipps, defaming euerie wighte, with breth of Sulphures smell, fedd with revenges desire, with brests defyld with gall, and hart of flaminge Ire, whose nayles are harpies clawes, and bodie leane and spare, which never smiles, beinge still opprest with greife &amp; care, whose frettinge pynes thy hart, and eates thy flesh awaie, still feeding on thy self, till thow dost cleane decaye like burning Aetna monte, which with his stinking fumes feedes on it self, and with his flame it self consumes. thy force ech sowle doth feele, thoughe, to thy better paine, except the mann deiect, whome fortune doth disdaine. (31) Mann must provide for bodie and sowle. The fairest Creature which the heavenlie hand created, hath the cheefest thinge hee made, the Lord of Ayre, of Earth, of sea, and Land, and of ech earthlie thinge which once must fade, composed is of bodie form'd of claye, and sowle divine which never shall decaye. His sacred minde, sprung from celestiall seede, doth him forwarne to lifte the same on hie. his earthlie bodie, which elements doth feede, makes him to thinke on thinges, and that be worldlie. Thus sowle and bodie, vnited by their kinde, makes mann both heaven and earth allwaies to mind. But soe to minde them both, as not excesse in either, fall contrarie to their due, for all extreames, the vice doth still expresse, the (meane) is that which wee ought to pursue; then, since god wilbe serv'd with both together, vse well the one, to helpe and serve the other. (32) Mongers. A messe of mongers on Holborne hill, the dolefull waie vnto the hatefull place, where malefactors, much against their will, cutt of their times with shame and fowle disgrace, were frendlie mett, ech other faire greetinge, asking what craft ech vsed for his livinge. One said he was of the ffellmongers trade; one other, that he Ironmonger was; the thirde, that hee was costardmongers Iade; the fourth, that he was a ffishmongers asse; to whome a fifte, as by them he did walke, with listening eare enclining to their talke, did saye, ‚Äúexclude me not, I craue, from out the rest, for of your trade I am the Quintessence, since I am a monger good as the best, and of my fleshe and purse, of Lardge dispence.‚Äù ‚Äúwhat monger maiest thow bee,‚Äù did one replie, ‚Äúvnknowne as yett to all this companie?‚Äù fforthwith the mann, as pertest of them all, sayed hee a whoremonger was knowne to bee; ‚ÄúI will not loose my place in mongers hall, being prentise once, although I now be free.‚Äù then all shooke hands, as nere of kinde to other, biddinge him wellcome as their loving brother; whoe, to confirme this knott of knaverie, vnto the taverne hasted spedilie. (33) Tyme. An Auncient knight of ffee and of renowne, with his Ladie to dinner sate him downe: they sett; the hungrie knight did bid his mann some pottage sett, with which the knight begann; but eatinge fast and over greedilie, a little herbe did take his course awrye, which made him coffe, that chok'd he was, he said. Yet the good Ladie, therwith not dismayed, ‚ÄúSir, it is tyme, it is but tyme,‚Äù replied. the payned knight, the more, for anger, cried that chok'd he was; but his Ladie, that ment but well, saied ‚Äúit is but tyme, sir, be content!‚Äù whereat the knight the more did coffe and strayne, ffor Anger of her speech then of the payne; for where her wordes the herbe tyme did intend, hee them mistooke, and deem'd shee sought his ende, since wronglie hee conceiv'd therbye that shee thought it but tyme that he should choked bee. (34) Receipts and expenses. A tutor, gluttinous and prodigall, was by the Iudge assigned to a pupill, who in excesse and ryot spendinge all, with daintie fare his hungrie mawe did fill. The Iudge, offended with this lewde expence, wilde the tutor a good accompt to make; but he replied, without all reverence, ‚Äúthere is naught left, and this count must you take.‚Äù The Angrie Iudge perceyvinge this deceipt, would knowe what he receyu'd and howe twas spent: the tutor, gaaping, said, ‚Äúher's the receyte and her's th'expence,‚Äù notinge his hinder vente. (35) Counterfetts deuoure the whole world. The kinge deuoures the husbandman; fond youths do spoyle the kinge; The vsurer consumes those youthes. the preist decaye doth bringe To vsurers; and whores consume the preist with filthie lust; The bawd eates vp the gayninge whore who putteth her in truste; The taverner beggars the bawde; and next is swallowed vpp The taverner, by Parasites which hange vpon the cupp. The needie Parasites in th'end are spoyled by lothed lyce; The Ape, mann counterfetter, eates those vermyn at a trice. So that the beastlie, mocking Ape, which mowes at everie thinge, By circulation doth consume the kingedome and the kinge. (36) That one thinge Produceth annother. The frutefull peace begetts desired plentie; desired plentie brings forth lothsome pride; the lothsom pride makes men by warr to die; longe warrs cause wofull povertie ech tyde, and povertie makes frutefull peace to springe: thus the worlds wheele is turn'd in everie thinge. The fruitfull earth gives forth sustayning grasse; sustayning grasse doth feed the norishing beasts; the nourishing beaste, into manns flesh doth passe; and glotinous mann, that feedes with daintie feaste, dissolved is to frutefull yearth in hast; for what feede vs, one vs doth feed at last. Thus runns about by dailie circulation ech earthlie thinge create by heavenlie hand; for ones curruption is others generation, as natures lawe hath linked with her band; then happie thow, if sowle in true degree doe end in god, from whome it came to thee. (37) A longe nose. A knight that should with curtesie a ladie entertayne, at her longe nose begann to scoffe with words of some disdaine, and said, ‚Äòyf your longe nose were not a bulwarke of defence To gard your lipps, they should be kiss'd before wee parted hence.‚Äô ‚Äòwhy, sir,‚Äô quoth shee, ‚Äòspare not therfore, yf nose such hindrance bee, you maie, where hindred nose doth want, with ease freelie kisse mee.‚Äô The scoffing knight thus retaunted, in furie flange awaye, But with replyeng scoffe before, he thus to her did saye: ‚ÄòMadame, it greatlie forceth not, for sweetnes of your breth, Whether I kisse your lipps above, or ells your hipps beneath.‚Äô (38) Spencers Fayrie Queene. Renowmed Spencer, whose heavenlie sprite ecclipseth the sonne of former poetrie, in whome the muses harbor with delighte, gracinge thy verse with Immortalitie, Crowning thy fayrie Queene with deitie, the famous Chaucer yealds his Lawrell crowne vnto thy sugred penn, for thy renowne. Noe cankred envie cann thy fame deface, nor eatinge tyme consume thy sacred vayne; noe carpinge zoilus cann thy verse disgrace, nor scoffinge Momus taunt the with disdaine, since thy rare worke eternall praise doth gayne; then live thou still, for still thy verse shall live, to vnborne poets, which light and life will give. (39) Martine. Menn say thow art call'd the Rich Martine, in Latiane speech who art Martinus nam'de; but wholie they mistake thie name, I wynne, if to thy gaine the same be dulie fram'd, for Martinus thow shouldst be termed right, in hording gould which hast soe greate delight. (40) Vsurers. Stukelie the vsurer is dead, and bid vs all farwell, who hath a Iourney for to ride vnto the court of hell; yf anie would his letters send to Plutoes divelishe grace, hee wilbe messenger therfore, and beare them to that place; but yf he anie answer crave, of letters sent from hence, he must some other post provide, which maie returne from thence, for Stukelie once arived there, cannot come back againe, since Pluto, for his needfull vse, doth meane him to retaine. (41) Grace. A man of lewd living all vertue sett at naught, was rested by Sergiant at mace, and vnto prison brought, who beinge sett at large, the Bishop would him trye, and him to common pennance put, for dedes of Lecherie. his aged mother, greved of her sonns open shame, with gentle speech of moothers loue, his lewd follies did blame, and said ‚Äòthat want of grace did force him soe to fall; wherfore hee dailie, on his knees, for needfull grace must call.‚Äô her scoffinge sonne, which scorn'd his mother with disdaine, said ‚Äòhee would rather hang, than seeke for anie grace againe; for seriaunt grace his mace, his purse had sucked drie, and the Archbishopps reverend grace had sham'd him penlie; And therefore since these twoo before, him did deface, he soe, past grace, bequeath[d] them both vnto the divells grace.‚Äô (42) Cardinge. Kate is a good huswife, as all men saye, for shee doth nought but card all the longe daie, whoe in continuall carding hath such delight, that, besides the daie, she will card in the night. ffor cardinge, to her is but a pleasant playe, and when she playes she is cardinge allwaies. Yet by her carding she hath little winninge, for of her carding never com[e]th spinninge; Soe she is a huswife, but noe good huswife, I trowe, for of good huswifes cardinge, spinning doth growe. (43) Reelinge. Iohn, thy wife, to live doth take great payne, a good huswifes name therbye to gaine; for she spinnes and Reeles as fast as shee maye, but cheeflie in reelinge spending the daye; for, once haue shee sett the pott at her hedd, she never lins reelinge till shee goe to bedd. (44) A Rose. Willford, thow lovest a pleasant Rose verie well, both for the faier cullor and the sweete smell, for thow canst not bee without a rose in thy bedd, to colle the, and to laye her arme vnder thy hedd. Yet is not thy Rose, flower of Carnation hue, nor perfect white, nor redd, but yellowishe and blewe, and therfore most meete to serve in the night, for other Roses would shame her if she were in the light. (45) Sowinge. Sweete flowers growe when gardeners sowes the seed; the plowman sowes the graine wherby wee live; and man sowes that wheron mankinde doth breed, soe that their sowing, his like doth allwaies give. But weemen sowe farr different from these kindes, both workes and wordes which send forth paine and greefe, for with there words they vex their husbands mindes, with needle sowinge, not gayninge their releife. They sowe discorde, with tongue of false report; their needle sowinge, doth breed but more expence; they sowe deceyt, and make therof a sport; their needle workes are but a showes pretence. Then lett not wemenn sowe, yf thow bee quiet bent, for of their doble sowing, growes naught but discontent. (46) Woodcocks. He is as wise as a Woodcock, all wee doe see, because everie woodcock is as wise as hee, which wee knowe to be true, and that the rather, for that Alderman woodcock was his father: A thinge of greate worth, that woodcocks are made the governours of Citties and the Marchants trade. Then woodcock on his side, by birth and by witt, makes him as wise as a woodcock his birth for to fitt; for if naught ells causd him a woodcock to bee, yet since he is borne a woodcock in everie degree, he cannot degenerate from woodcocks kinde, and therfore as wise as a woodcock you shall him finde. (47) Kissinge. Three pleasant gentlemen vpon the waye did meete three maides that went them forth to playe; the menn of ech other would gladlie knowe, which of the maides he would kisse in the rowe. the maydes, like goselinges, after other went, noe whit mindinge the menn nor their intent. But of the menn, the first amongst the rest, that with his fellowes scoffinglie would Iest, said ‚Äòhee would kisse the pretie maide before,‚Äô not meaning for to meddle with anie more. the other said, ‚Äòyf he might haue his wishe, the browne wench in the middle he would kisse;‚Äô the third, as liked best vnto his minde, said ‚Äòhee would kisse the blobcheckt wench behinde.‚Äô Nowe, fellow Garrett, of the would I crave, which of these three the sweetest kisse should haue; for the wenches breath, formost of the three, smelled verie ranke in the highest degree. (48) White heares. At the Rose within newgate, ther frendlie did meete, fower of my ould frends, ech other for to greete: one had a black beard, but white was his hedd; one other, white hedd, with a beard which was redd; the third had yellowish hedd, but his beard somewhat white; the yongest had silver berde, and hedd agreeing righte. thus sett at their cupps, they thought to devise howe these severall white heares in them did arise. the black berd and white hedd begann for to saye, ‚Äòhis hedd was elder then his berde by twentie winters daye, ffor where nature by age doth soonest decaye, graye heares spring vp, which age doe displaye.‚Äô the other white hedd with the reddishe beard, tould, ‚Äòthat his hedd was not white because he was ould, but for that he had more labored, by studie his brayne, then his teeth by eatinge, his hedd white heares did gayne.‚Äô the third, with yellowish hedd and beard somwhat white, Philosopher-like, this cause did recite, ‚ÄòI see it perfect true, for soe you agree, that what is labored most will weakest bee; and what of mann is most weake by kinde, soonest graye haires in that part you shall finde; then vsinge my teeth more than my witt, by right, my berde then my witt, must needes be more white.‚Äô the last, with a ieste to knitt vp the game, this reason for himself begann for to frame, ‚Äòhornes and hoore hares comm not by age, menn tell, and that by my self I haue tried verie well, for havinge both agreeing together, Cares gaue the one, and my wife gaue the tother.‚Äô (49) Cutters. ‚ÄòIack, I here thow hast leaft thine ould trade; thow wilt noe more become a ripiers Iade.‚Äô ‚ÄòIn fayth, good Will, thow sayest true, for I haue left mine ould occupation for a newe, for I cann braue it in the streetes with the rest, beinge a right cutter, as good as the best.‚Äô ‚ÄòA cutter! what cutter, I praye the, maye that bee? a cutter of Queene hithe, or a garment cutter, tell mee, A Swashebuckler cutter, or one of the cutthrotes, or a garden cutter, or a false cutter of groates? Or art thow such a cutter as ostelers and tapsters be, or a woode cutter, a stone cutter, or a heare cutter, letts see?‚Äô noe, in faith, Will, for better or worse, I am none of these, but a plaine cutpurse; a life of such pleasinge, that I never feele payne till the rope and the gallowes doe hinder my gaine.‚Äô (50) The deceased Pretor. Thy vertue, not thy vice; faith, not dissembling speech; thy goodnes, not thy flowings goods, made thee this honor reach. (51) To Humfrie Waldronn. Yf reasons worthie minde prescribe this reede, and Iustice bidd ech one with Iust desart for to requite with like, the frendlie deede, in outward shewe and inward faithfull harte, then must I yeald vnto your gentle heste, and streyne my quill to answere your request. Wherin with slender phrase I gentlie craue your skillfull muse to pardon skillesse write, and rather waie the honnest minde I haue, then simple quill which rashelie doth recite what Idle brayne hath fondlie found at large, which I present, our freindshipp to discharge. A ffoolishe Cherill I maye seeme to bee, that shame not to present vnto thy sight Sir Topas ridinge rime not meet for thee, Nor Gouldings learned vewe, that famous wight, whose hawtie verse, with sugredd words well knitt, bereaves the same of Chawcers flowing witt. Then frendlie take in gree this frendlie verse I frame, and thinke, to his Perithous, that Thesius writes the same. (52) Fortune. Blinde ffortune, with her fonde and sencelesse sence, regarding nought the worth of anie wight, which heedleslie her riches doth dispence, not forcinge whether shee doth wronge or right, Enricht by suche as vices do adorne, The good reiectinge with most bitter skorne, Which growes, for that noe perfect good she knowes, beinge onelie fedd with vaine and outward showes. (53) To his freind Burrell. The loathed povertie still shall thee feede yf poore thow be in anie time of life, By byrth, or fortune, or for want of heede, for vnto such, rewards are nothinge rife, since, in this thanklesse age, none wealth attaine, but such as riches haue, and giue for gaine. Then must thy hard and woefull state of shamefast povertie Embrace patience, since vnto thee welth will not multiplie. (54) Issues. The Ioyfull mother brings forth manie faire yssues, the learned lawyer brings his cause to good yssues, the skilld Phisition makes for goute runninge yssues, the faulting Iuror is amerc'd in much yssues; the large expences are counted needles yssues; but yet, of all the yssues wee haue in anie kinde, none is more badd then yssuing from our land, wee finde, for soe our witt and wealth from vs soone yssues then, which lost and brought to naught, w'are scorned of all menn: Such yssue they obteyne, their birth right which doe sell, on which yssue the verdit hath condempned mee right well. (55) Mariage. Deepe witted menn, b'experience haue contrived, that mariage good and quiet is ech hower, where the mans heringe organs are deprived of their right vse and sound receyving power, and where is seeled vp the womans percing sights that shee maie not behould her husbands sweet delights. ffor since nature hath made that sex most fraile, and subiect to tormentinge Ielousie, vpon ech guiltles signe they will not fayle, their loving husbands to suspect falselie; yet if she could not see, but were by nature blinde, such fonde conceites she would not harbor in her minde. And if suspected mann were dombe to heere the Iealous brawles of his vnquiet wife, ech would embrace and hould the other deere, wherbye they might obtayne a quiet life, without which rare effects, swete mariage is a hell, but linked with these guiftes, doth Paradice excell. (56) Sweete mouthes. A noble Earle, to vertue allwaies bent, with rich and scoffinge knight on hunting went: the Buck was rows'd, the hounds vncopled bee, who with swifte course, to flie did seeme to mee, and eger of the game, in their full crie with dobled voice lowd ecchoed in the skie, whose pleasant musick did the eares delight of Earle and all the rest, except the knight, that pleasured more in purchasing and gayne than hawkes or hounds, or in such toyes vaine. of whome the Earle demanded curteouslie, when ended was the hounds long solempne crie, ‚Äòyf those faire doggs, with their reioicing voice, had not sweete mouthes as hounds of rarest choice;‚Äô wherto the knight gaue answere scoffinglie, ‚Äòhee did not knowe till hee the same should trie, for anie of them he never kissed there, and soe knewe not how sweet that there mouthes were.‚Äô wherat good Earle, which tooke it in disdaine, from moved chollar hardlie could refraine, but said ‚Äòif that you kist them not before, you maie with ease kisse them behinde the more.‚Äô (57) Fooles. Hee was not wise, his witt hath him deceyved, that would bee wise, and not a foole be deemed, but I, which haue the truth by witt conceyved, doe holde it best a foole to bee estemed, the cause wherof by reason is perceyved, ffor wisdome knowes, of fooles is endlesse number, that in their follie foolishlie doe slumber. Then is it best to be of that consort and sweete societie which moste doe hould; the fewest menn to wisdome doe resort, and leste in number soonest are contrould; soe least are least estem'd in everie sort; then must the wise, which is the lesser number, be compted those which all the world doe cumber. Greate ffranchises the fooles are knowen to haue, because they swaye in all the greatest part: the wise stand back, forc't of the fooles to crave, thoughe fooles cannot Iudge of their good deserte, yet must those fooles their vertuous life deprave, for they stand warme, are fedd and cloth'd of beste, when wise menn begg, or are with famin prest. (58) Gallopinge. ffrom windsore ridinge, to the statelie towne, the seate of ffamous kings and Inglands pryde, in hast, I mett, in midst of Hunslowe downe, a gentle youth which postinglie did ride, a frend of mine, whome I forc'd there to staie, to knowe the cause hee ridd soe fast awaye. Whoe said, ‚Äúmuse not, I frendlie the require, to see mee gallop with soe light a hedd, since I farr lighter am in this retyre, then when to London I my Iourney spedd; ffor when I went, my creed 12 partes did holde, but one is lost, soe I more light and bould, the twelfe is gone, eleaven I keepe in store, Christ went not vnto hell: what would you more?‚Äù (59) Churches. The Auncient Saxons did full Christianlie, to shewe their fervent zeale and zealous love, erect most statelie churches plenteouslie, as holie place ordain'd for god above. But nowe le monde reuerse, the world turn'd upside downe, our Scismatikes will haue noe church in Cittie or in towne. Noe Church! alas! what doe I saye? I lye; they sett vpp churches twentie for their one, for everie private howse spirituallie must bee their church, for other will they none, Excepte the open felds, or ells false Ethnicks groves of trees, where sencelesse as the sencelesse woods they flock like swarms of bees; there sowe they Satans damning seedes, of which dissention springs, (tearing Christes vndivided coate), which all to ruyne bringes. (60) Menn before Adame. Good Moses (which didst write by sprite of God), some makes thy witt as watrye as thy name; thy art, to serpents which did turne thy rodd, thy sacred quill, which newborne world did frame, are nothinge worth; thy Iudgements are but lame; ffor the Italian redie witt doth sett the vnto schoole, and Francis George, in his scriptures problemes, makes the a foole. Thow couldst not see, (which everie thinge didst see, of newspronge world Create by Ioue his hand,) that before Adame, (calld first mann by thee,) were manie menn (which by thy words is skande), for some Italians thy words so vnderstand, And Francis George doth, Talmude like, by thy penn thee confound, Provinge that manne Androgenon was first made out of grownde: But lett those wranglinge witts, that seeme to teach godds heavenlie sprite, Beware his scourging rodd deprive them not of sence and light. (61) Iuye. Thow Bacchus plant, which allwaies greene dost springe, Poets reward, and glorie of their penn, the touchstone of wyne which to the sprite doth bringe a quickning force to rouse the witt of menn, why dost thow clyme my howse so spreddinglie, and yeald thy sacredd budds soe frutefullie? In vaine thow doest ascend these rurall tyles which profound Virgill never yet behelde, nor wantonn Ouid, whose rare penn compyles strange changed shapes which abstruse science yeald, nor wittie Flaccus did hange his harpe here, nor doth Tibullus gold in this appere. ffor in this cottage rurall muse doth reste; here dwelleth Cherill, and Topas the knighte; pore oten ryme is onelie here exprest, noe helicon verse or muse of rare delight; but since thow hast this rusticke wall adorned, doe florishe longe, all though my verse be scorned. (62) Iestinge. Three things there be which maie susteyne noe Ieste or foolishe blemishe of our Idle braine: the honest fame wherwith our life is blest; our godlie faith, for that maye bide noe stayne of heresie, or false religions bayne; Next, watrishe eye, wherof ech litle gall doth hurte the sight and dangers th'ye withall. (63) Honor. The glorious Queene, honor, desir'd of all, wherto ambitious mindes greatlie aspires, still gapinge, that on them her rayes maye fall with glorious stiles to answer their desires, which hautie hart by price and prayse requires, is seldome found, as grave ancients devise, of such as gredilie wold to honnor rise. ffor shee enquires of those shee never sawe, she followeth them that from her faste doe flye, she honnors such from her which doe withdrawe, she loveth all that naught esteemes her glorie, she calls for them that scorns her vanitie, she trusteth those whome she did never knowe, and such rewards in whome hidd vertues flowe. This contemplative Philosophers tould With all their skill, vnknowinge her true kinde; for other course doth this faire Ladie hould, since to her glitteringe bowres newe stepps are signed, whertoe nowe none the redie waye cann finde, but suche as enter with a keye of gould by false faire shewes or flatteries manifold. (64) Temperance. The heroike vertues Cardinall, wherof the learned write, Doe from right kinde degenerate, and with themselves do fighte. If heavenlie temperance doe not their Rygor moderate, As the true arbitrer and the true stickler of their bate. ffor Iustice without temperance shadowes revenginge Ire, And fortitude without the same is rashe vnquenched fyre. Soe wisdome wanting the due force of temperance, wee trye, Egregious follie to be deem'de, and cosoninge subtiltie. when hee which hath true temperance, all vertues doth embrace, Is wise, is iust, is valiant, and honnored in ech place. Since this faire Queene, dame Temperance, attended is allwaies with rare and honnorable maydes deserving worthie prayse; ffor lawded virgin modestie, and blushefull shamefastnes, And holie abstinence, the nourse of all true godlines, Pure honestie, wise frugallness, and right sobrietie, The Angellike continencie, and fames eternitie, Doe dailie followe Temperance, as handmaides ever preste, And worthie members of that Queene, for to performe her heste, Whoe, for their Ladies liverie, her ensigne and her worde, To shewe how her wise actions doe with her speech accord. This famous sentence beare vppon their sleeves embrodred still (Not to much), which wise Pitacus fram'd to her sacred will. (65) Doinge nothinge. A Crabbed Cobler, and his slothfull wife, which would not labour for to gett her meate, from words to blowes did often fall at strife; but as the husband did her feircelie beate, this question shee did oftentimes repeate: ‚Äòwhy doe you thus torment me in my life, Since I haue nothinge said, nor nothinge donne?‚Äô but he, continuinge still as he begun, Said, ‚Äòfor that cause onelie he made his blowes soe rife.‚Äô (66) Astrologers. Malevolent Saturne, vnhappie starr, hath loste the vse of ferce and cruell sight, Ne cann from stone a childe discerne from farre; the shamefaste moone cann with her bashefull light see naught but what is pure and virgin bright; the thundringe Ioue, with loue doth onelie minde his white Europa, though a mortall wight; the warlike Mars, to coole his youthfull kinde, doth Venus halse; and lustfull Venus, Mars doth bynde. The Lawrell Phebus, with his glittering hedd, the glorious god that rules in fyerie chaire, doth onelie thinke on Daphnes plesante bedd; to Herseus love, doth Mercurie repaire, the wittie sonne of Maya the faire: thus all the plannetts are employd in skye; wherbye thow maist (Astrologer) dispaire, by their aspectes or workinge power, to trye whoe doth the Cuckold make, and thy hed hornifie. (67) The herbe filius ante Patrem. A vertuous Ladie, skilfull herbaliste, in Chimick art whoe takes noe meane delight, whome modestie with good report hath bliste, and wifelie dutie hath adorned righte, of gentleman (that learned would bee deem'd, as by his tria verba he had seem'de,) Demanded ‚Äòif the herbe most rare of sight, and of all Artistes greatlie esteem'de, which filius ante patrem they doe hight, were to him knowne‚Äô: who said, with courage bould, his deepe insight in herbes for to vnfould, ‚Äòit is, madame, well knowne to everie wight, to be sonne of Antipater, as learned men doe houlde.‚Äô (68) Monstrous Childe. Did Learned Ouid live, with poetrie divine, his Metamorphosis he would a newe refyne, and add this prodigie, as vncouth as the reste, of his transformed shapes which there he hath expreste; ffor here, though bodies were to other forms not chang'd, Yet is this followinge truth as farr from nature strang'd, That the celestiall saints which doe adorne the skye, should from the heavens discend, and children multiplie; for why sainte Peters sonne, a thinge to fewe men knowne, maintaind a child which he supposd to bee his owne, yet others had more righte to her by kindlie knott; soe easilie one others child falls to our lott. This is a thinge vnvsd, a Saint a sonne to haue, and hee deformed, not shap'd as heavenlie bodies crave, whoe, though of heavenlie seed, yet was he foule beguylde, that fondlie nourished as his, one others childe, exceedinge anie chyld which natures course doth give, for lightlie she could beare the tallest mann on live; soe bigg her bone in bredth, soe monstrous shee did seeme, that ech, noe childe, but perfect woman, did her deeme. Thus nature changinge kinde, these monsters forth doth sende, Saint Peters sonne, a woman childe, which could with menn contende. (69) A godly mann. He is a godlie mann, that doth with tongue and minde and sincere hart, the heavenlie god adore in his true kinde, That liberall is to pore, that Iustice doth maintaine, And beinge chosen for a Iudge, takes noe reward for gayne; That is not mov'd with loue, or doth for anger hate, And as infectinge poysonn, shunns fonde scouldinge and debate; That hath a good foresight in what he takes in hand, that rashelie nothinge doth attempte which reason maie withstande; That chooseth honnest frends, for to converse with all, whose sage and true advise maye helpe in dangers when they fall; That vtters with his tongue, but what his hart conceives, And doth envie that wicked speech, which other menn deceyves;‚Äî This is a godlie mann; but I thinke none is found, In whome these sacred vertues doe in their full power abounde. (70) Kindred. Why kneele you heere, faire Ladies, thus amased, before Apollo, as though you sacrificed? These litle babes within your armes thus foulded, in weepinge sort soe piteouslie disguised? what secret greife of fortunes evill change hath happened you? declare, and bee not straunge. Wee here lament noe fortune of mishapp, wee crave noe goodes from godds for to discende, ne doe wee wishe our Ennemies to entrapp, nor seeke revenge of such as vs offende, but of most fowle incest wee feele false fame, and craue Apollo to rid vs from the same. ffor these two babes which here thow dost behould, are our owne sonns by fleshlie generation; they are brothers to our husbands, of this be bould, and vncles to ech other by procreation; their mothers and grandmothers thow shalt vs finde in lawfull mariage and course of honnest kinde. which wee beseech Apollo for to shewe, who leavinge that to earthlie menn of skill, wee thee desire, yf ought therof thou knowe, the same to tell accordinge to our will; Soe shall wee sound thy worth and learned name, Since thow shalt cleere vs from incestuous shame. (71) The Courte and Cuntrey. My yonge and youthfull yeares, that once drewe forth my life In pleasant game of ffancies trayne, where pleasures all were rife, Haue nowe forsaken quite their ould and wonted trade; My strength is gone, my mirth is past, my wantonn daies doe fade. ffor where I often vsed, amongst the Courtlie sort, In Idle play, through bewties hue, with loving talke to sport, Nowe am I shakenn of, My faltring tongue doth staye, Vntimelie thoughts of such mishapp hath worne such toyes awaye, And I must rest at home, lock'd from my pleasures paste; They scorne me nowe whome I disdaind: this is my fall at laste. ffrom Court to cart I flye, a longe but easie leppe; I liste noe more with glosinge speech on fortunes wheele to stepp. She did advance me once, to throwe me downe againe, But through her spite and my good happ more quiet I attaine. The little shrubbs that growe hard by the tender grasse, Abide the force of blusteringe winde, when greater trees doe crashe. The lowe and meane estate is surest thinge, I finde; The Courtlie life vnstedfast is, more fleeting than the winde. There spend they all they haue, and more, if need require; They gape for this, they watch for that, they followe ech desire. They frowne vpon their frends, and fawne vpon there foes; They envie all the favored, they scorne the mann in woes; They presse vpon the prince, they glose for hope of gayne; they hate the wise, they ride the fooles, they laughe and loue in vaine. They seeke with greatest shewe for to maintaine their route; They pinche and spare, they carke and muse, to bringe the same about. Thus, vnder all this shewe and troope of goulden sights, They doe possesse vnrestfull daies and thowsand woefull nights. ffore loe, this goulden miserie, as I doe finde, is naught, But highe disdaine Ioynd with distresse and manie mourning thought. Wheras my Cuntrye life, which nowe I take in hand, Bringes quiet rest, a carelesse minde, it needes noe lustie band. Wee envie noe estate, wee loue the porest sorte; We lavishe not Ill gotten goods, wee keepe a meaner port. Wee spend as reason bidds, wee entertaine our frend In honnest state; and when you lack, then must wee seeme to lend; which is farr better case, at neede allwaies to haue, Then for to spend without a reine, and then haue need to craue. Our garments are not gaye, our garners haue the more; wee seeke noe statelie halls, nor hante the Princes Court therfore, But live in pore estate, more quiet in our brest Then those whome dailie service doth procure soe much vnrest. Wee passe the silent night with his vnbroken sleepe; Wee ease our heavie minde with mirth; of loue wee take noe keepe. I therfore flie the presse and troope of Courtlie trayne And scorne their pride that scorne my fall, to rest from restles payne. I leaue the Courtlie life to those that skillesse are, And hedlonge runn by others harms, that soone will not beware. My cottage doth content my well contented minde; My wantoun yowth is gone, and nowe grave thoughts in hedd I finde. Thus well I tried haue, that my mishappe hath wrought, More quiet state for my behoofe then I had ever thoughte. In happie tyme, therefore, I banishd such a life, where no thinge certaine maie be found, where all things are but strife. Thus, carefull Court, farwell! and wellcome Cuntrie state, where thow shalt live at quiet rest from all envyenge hate. (72) The number 1, 2, 3, 4. One simple thinge cann nothinge worke, yt maie not stand, but fall. Twoe maie both much and great things doe; but three maie compasse all. And fower, I trulie finde to bee perfection of ech thinge, ffor in the same conteyned is what heaven and earth maye bringe. Woe, then, to him that is alone, Kinge Dauids sonne cold saye, for yf he fall, he wanteth helpe to raise him or to staye. But where twoe things doe meete in one, as nature help'd by art, There mann maye prove miraculous, through his celestiall part. But rightlie yf these worthie two themselves from Center spred To three kinds of Philosophie, newe Creatures maie be bred. ffor if divine Philosophie, the naturall and morrall, ffrom Center spred themselves abrode and then in Center fall, There wilbe vnion of these three, Sol, lune, and Mercurie; ffor in the heaven and Earth three things the truth do testifie: All which Saint Iohn did trulie knowe, and therefore rightlie tould That three is one, and one is three, which fewe menn cann vnfould. But if with all this secrett three the number fower be placed, In Tetragramaton I finde the worke shall well be graced. Add therefore one to three and fower, makinge the number tenn, In which enclosed is the skill fast lock'd from common menn. Take this my sweete conceyt in worth, though worthlesse vnto thee, whose sacred witt, with abstruse skill is fraught in ech degree. (73) Mr Camdens Britania. The holie licor (whose mysteries divine to Venus Squire consecrate are seene) needes not the Poets braunch (touchstone of wyne), the Clyming Ivye allwaies freshe and greene, In Sommers scorchinge heate and winters could, to make that wyne the better to be sould. And learned Camden, with his searching witt, whose deepe studie, by travells carefull payne, hath from errors and mace of Dedalus pitt, (for Cuntries loue,) drawne vnto light agayne worthye Antiquities, wherof before none sayed the like, or shall doe anie more. This Philopolites needeth not, I saye, My rough pensill to portrait his desart; but as good wyne commends it self allwaie without the Ivye signe, soe in noe part he needes noe prayse, synce that his learned quill with flowing style his prayses doth distill. ffor by his guide the Roman names doe live, and ancient things consum'd by cancred byte of ould Iniurious tyme, he doth revive, in Latiane tongue, a worke which breedes delight and Cuntries good, to such as will embrace soe rare a gemm not found in other place. His deepe conceit I highlie doe admire, his strange Invention I knowe not howe to praise, the truth of things whereto he doth aspire is past my reach to shewe by anie waies; what will you more? breifelie, this thing I teach, hee hath donne that which noe mann ells could reach. Buy then this worke! doe read and reade againe! esteeme the mann, as hee doth merrit well! requite with thanks the frute of Endlesse payne represse envye! in vaine! since I knowe well, to seeke a knott in rushe thow maist contend, and teare with spite what thow canst not amende. (74) Solomons witt. ffreind Eldrington, thow art as wise As Salomon, menn saye, ffor thow art like to him in witt, in earnest and in playe. But what is like, is not the same, as all menn well doe finde: Soe thow hast not Solomons witt in all points of his minde. Yet in one thinge thow dost the height of his rare witt expresse, In chaunge of Venus sweete delights and Lecheries excesse. In other thinges thow art not hee, noe more then is an Ape, Whoe is like thee in Peevishe witt and in deformed shape. Thus must I playe with thy fyne witt, to answere thy fonde Ieste, That scoffes at everie meaner witt, which wisemenn doe detest. (75) Leylandes rightefull ghost. What Endore phytonesse, what envious hart, what fourth furie, what rage of witlesse braine Doth vex my sprite against his due desart, and force me causelesse, wronglie to complaine? one guiltlesse hand, which doth mye fame retaine, all thoughe detractinge penn with deepe despite cannot behould the beames of Englands lighte. My name, my fame, my labors, and my penn, my indisgested worke of highe conceit, came not to be obscur'd in thanklesse Denne, ffor he (whome skillesse malice through deceit sekes to entrapp with hooke of scorning beyt) doth gratefullie receyve my buryed name, which otherwise had perished to my shame. By him I live, by him the world doth knowe, by him the heauens and humane Lawes doe finde that he hath, farr beyond my broken shewe, his Cuntries glorie in one worke combinde, with gratious style, and sprite of heavenlie minde, which both to mine and his immortall praise, in spite of spite, will honnored bee allwaies. And therefore, in most humble sort, doe sue that Learn'd Camden his right guerdon maye haue, and that those coniuringe words maie finde ther due, which vex my sprite, and raise me from my grave, whoe never deem'd his learning to deprave ffor I confesse, he rarelie doth compleate that famous worke which I could not entreate. (76) Quiet and Rest. As wearie bodie doth restore his strength with rest, as fertill soyle sometimes vntild doth prove the best, As laboringe beastes, the ox, the horse, must quiet haue, as toylinge daie, the restefull night doth dulie crave, As bowe still bent, in time is weake and looseth strength, As Sommers flowers in Winters rootes doe reste at length,‚Äî Soe must the rulinge minde, the seate where reasone reynes, with quiet recreate it self from former paynes. ffor what wants interchanged rest will weare awaye, And restles paines, both witt and wealth, doth soone decaye. Then cease, thow wearie muse, allwaies to beate thy brayne And weare thy paynefull hand, which never reaped gaine; Since all thy sweating toyle finds but such hard event As damned Sisiphus, most bitter punishement, Wherbye thy goulden tyme thow thriftelesse dost consume, Like Gebers Cooke, to waste thy wealth in Ayerye fume.
