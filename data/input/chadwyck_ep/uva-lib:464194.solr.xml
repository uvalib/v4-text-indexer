      <field name="fulltext">Greg. Nazianz. Orat. 40. In Baptisma. ? ???????? ???? ? ???????, ??? ??????? ???????? ?????????. Psalmorum Cantillatio, cum quâ accipiês,[illeg.] illius Hymnodiæ præludium, &amp;c. Hippolyt. Episcop. Orat. de Consummat. Mundi, ex versione Jo. Pici. Temporibus Antichristi Psalmorum decantatio cessabit. Psal. I. The man is blest whose feet not tread, By wicked counsailes led: Nor stands in that perverted way, In which the Sinners stray; Nor joynes himselfe unto the chaire, Where Scorners seated are; But in God's Law both dayes and nights To meditate delights. He shall be like a Planted Tree We neere the Rivers see: Whose branches by their moisture spring, And fruits in season bring. No parching droughts his leaf invade, Or make his blossome fade. For God will his indeavours blesse With prosperous successe. But wicked men themselves shall find Like chaff blow'n by the wind. Nor in the finall Judgment must Stand up among the Just. For God the righteous guides, and knowes The path wherein he goes: When wayes of Sinners perish shall In their eternall fall. Psal. II. Why do the furious Heathen rage? Vaine people why engage? Kings of the Earth a Party make, And Rulers counsell take. Who 'gainst the Lord that Earth doth sway, And His Annointed, say, Break we the Bonds They on us lay, And cast Their Cords away. But God, who doth the Heavens guide, Shall them in Scorne deride, Then shall His soare displeasure breake, And He in anger speake. Yet have I set my King on high, Adorn'd with Majesty: Upon Mount Sion rais'd the throne Of mine Annointed one. I will declare that firme decree, The Lord hath said to me. Thou ar't my Son, without all spot, This day I thee begot. Ask me, and thine Inheritance Ore Nations I'le advance: Far as the earth, or Sea extends, Are thy Possessions ends. Thou with an Iron Rod shalt bruise Such as thy pow'r refuse. And like a Potters Vessell broak, So dash them by thy stroake. O therefore all ye Kings that awe The Nations with your Law; Yee Judges of the earth be wise: His Scepter not despise. Serve ye the Lord with holy feare; Rejoyce, yet rev'rence beare And kisse the Sonne, before his wrath Your way consumed hath. For if a little that encrease, Where can we seek for Peace? Since they are only safe, and blest, Whose hope in Him doth rest. Psal. III. O Lord, how fast do they encrease, Who troubled have my Peace? They many are, who 'gainst me rise, And are my enemies. Many there be my Soule upbraid, And say, God cannot aid. But Lord! Thou art my Sheild, my Praise Thou shalt my head up-raise. To God my loud request did cry, Who heard my voyce from high. I lay'd me downe, and rose againe: For He did me sustaine. Then though ten thousands me invade, I will not be afraid. No, though with threats the furious rowt Encompasse me about. Arise, and save me O my God: For with thy vengefull rod Thou smit'st the cheek, and break'st the jaw Of such as hate thy Lawes. To Thee O Lord our God alone Belongs Salvation. Who do'st Thy blessings evermore Upon Thy People powre. Psal. IV. God of my righteousnesse attend, When my requests ascend. Thou hast enlarg'd me in distresse, And eas'd my heavinesse. How long O Mortals will ye shame The glory of my Name? How long will ye love vanities, And take delight in Lies? Know that the Lord elected hath Men of unmoved faith. He, when before His throne I cry, Will not my suite deny. Stand of His greatnesse then in awe, Nor sinne against His Law. When on your bed retir'd, and still, O meditate his will? Of Righteousnesse the Offering To God your maker bring: And on the hope of His defence, Place all your confidence. Yet some, who Him not understood, Aske, who shall doe us good? Lord let thy face, &amp; beames divine, On us thy servants shine. Thou fill'st my heart with greater joyes, Then theirs, whom plenty cloyes. Who reape their fruits in time of peace, whose Corne, and Wine encrease. I lay mee downe, with quiet blest, To take my sleep, and rest: For thou, whose goodnesse doth excell, Mak'st me in safety dwell. Psal. V. Lord, Ponder what my words relate, Weigh what I meditate. My God and King my cry attend: To Thee my Pray'rs I send. My voyce O Lord shall in the morne Up to thy Throne be borne. Betimes will I direct my cry, And looke to thee on high. For thou in Sin tak'st no delight, No ill dwells in thy sight. The foolish stand not in thine eye, Who hat'st iniquity. Thou shalt the lying lips destroy, Who leasing make their joy. God will the bloody minded hate, And punish all deceit. But I, presuming on Thy care, Will to thy House repaire: And tow'rds thy Temple in thy feare, Due adoration beare. Mee Lord in righteousnesse dispose, Beset with watchfull foes. Make streight thy way before my face, And guide mee by thy grace. No faithfullnesse their mouth containes, Their heart fowle Malice staines. Wide Sepulchres are their black throats, Their tongues but flatt'ring notes. O God destroy, and let them all By their own Counsailes fall; Themselves by their transgressions quell, Who 'gainst Thy pow'r rebell. But let all faithfull ones rejoyce, And showt with cheerfull voyce: Because Thy love, which knowes no end, Doth ever them defend. Let those rejoyce, in Thee who trust; For Thou wilt blesse the Just: And with Thy favour, as a sheild, In danger safety yeild. Psal. VI. Rebuke me not O Lord in wrath, Whose sinne deserv'd it hath: Nor let thy hot displeasure burne, Least I to nothing turne. Have pitty Lord, for I am weak, Asham'd my sinnes to speake. O heale me, for my bones are vext, My Soul with griefe perplext. How long shall I lament, and cry, For my delivery? O turne! and me to favour take, For thine owne mercies sake. Can he, who looses lifes short breath, Remember Thee in death? Or will the dust, and silence raise A voyce to sound Thy praise? Weary, and faint, my soule bemoanes Her vaine and fruitlesse groanes. My bed the mark of sorrow weares, Each night bedew'd with teares. My fight is dimme, my melting eye Clouded with misery. I languish, through my haters rage, Into untimely age. Depart from me all wicked ones; The Lord hath heard my moanes. My voyce of weeping, and my teares Sound lowdly in His eares. God, who my supplication takes, In Pardon answer makes. When their despight, who me defame, Shall cover'd be with shame. Psal. VII. Sing this as Psalme 51. O Lord my God in thee I trust; Deliver mee from the unjust. Least Lyon-like my soule he teare, Whilst none is for my reskue neare. Lord if this guilt upon me stands, Or wickednesse be in my hands; If friend I ill rewarded have, Or causelesse foe I did not save: Then let mine enemy pursue, Let him my captive soule subdue: Let him my life to earth down thrust, And lay mine honour in the dust. O Lord! in thy fierce wrath arise; Take vengeance on mine enemies. The people then shall me come nigh; For their sakes lift thy selfe on high. The Lord his judgement shall dispence, According to mine innocence: O let all wicked counsailes end; But just men stablish, and defend. For God the heart and reines doth try Preserves men of integrity. God doth in right his judgements lay Yet is provoked every day. If he not turne, His sword is whet; His bow is bent, and ready set. The instruments of death He brings, And arrowes from His quiver flings. Behold he travailes great with hate, Mischiefe conceaves, brings forth deceit. He made a ditch, and dig'd a Pit, And he himselfe is fall'n in it. Thus all his practises revert, To strike his owne malicious heart. His mischiefe shall his own head wound; His violence himselfe confound. I will the praise of God expresse, According to His righteousnesse: And in my Songs extoll the fame Of His most high, most glorious Name. Psal. VIII. Lord! how excelling is Thy Name Through earths extended frame! Who hast Thy glory set on high, Above the starry sky. Thou didst by infant mouthes ordaine Renowne and strength to gaine: Whose weaknesse might thy foes confound, And the Avenger wound. When I consider, Heavens state Thy fingers did create; The Moone, with all the Stars of night, To which thy beams gave light: O what is Man, or all his race, Thy favour should him grace? Whom, made next Angels in renowne, Thou wilt with glory crowne. Thou under his command hast layd The workes Thy hand had made. What in each element doth meet, Is subject to his feet. All sheep, and beasts which range the feild The fowles which aire doth yield: The Fishes, which their motion keep Within the liquid deep. O Lord our Governour, whose sway All in the world obey! How far excelling is Thy Name Through earths extended frame! Psal. IX. Sing this as Psalme 51 I thee will praise with my whole heart And all thy wond'rous works impart In Songs, and Hymns rejoyce will I, To blesse Thy Name, O Thou most high Mine enemies repulsed all Shall at Thine awfull presence fall. Thou hast my righteous cause maintain'd, Whose throne wrong judgement never stain'd. At Thy rebuke the Heathens fame Destroyed is, put out their name. O thou malitious enemy, Thy loath'd remembrance now must dy. And like the Cities thou hast ras'd, Thine own Memoriall is defac'd. But God for ever shall endure, His throne in judgment stablish'd sure. The world Hee'll judge in righteousnesse; A Refuge be in times distresse: Who know Thy Name in Thee will trust, For Thou hast never left the just. Praise God, who doth in Sion dwell; His doings to the people tell. When He enquires for Blood, the Cry Nere passes from His memory. Have mercy on my troubled state, O Lord, who lift'st me from death's gate: That Sion I thy praise may shew, Whose joyes from thy Salvation grow. Sunke to the Pit the Heathen are; Their feet are caught in their own snare, The Lord in their revenge is know'n, Who by themselves are overthrow'n. The wicked shall be turn'd to hell, And all, who God forgetting, fell. For on the poore He thinkes alway, Nor shall the Needies hope decay. Up Lord! and let not man prevaile, Nor let thy judgements ever faile. Put them in feare; the Nations then Will know themselves to be but men. Psal. X. Sing this as the Lamentation. Why (Lord!) dost Thou so far abide? Thy face in times of trouble hide? Proud men the helplesse persecute; But let them fall in the pursuit. He boasteth in his own desires, And wretches, whom God hates, admires. Through pride of heart he God neglects, Whom he nor thinkes on, nor affects. His grievous wayes Thy judgments flight; His thoughts do feare no opposite, He said, I never shall be mov'd, Nor by adversity be prov'd. His mouth deceit and curses fill; Whilst mischiefes from his tongue distill. He lurkes to kill the innocent; His eyes against the poore are bent. He as a Lyon lyes in wait To catch the guiltlesse through deceit. With humble shewes he doth assay To make the poore his strong ones prey. His heart hath said, God hath forgot: He hides His face, and seeth not. O God, lift up thy selfe, arise, And think upon our miseries. Why doth his pride, and scorn surmount? As if that God kept no account; Nor will his wicked workes require, Or in His judgements pay their hire. Lord! Thou hast seen his impious spight, Whose hand their follies can requite. He trusts on Thee, whom woes oppresse, Who still do'st help the fatherlesse. Break Thou their wicked arme at length, And let them perish by Thy strength. Thou canst, O Lord, Eternall King, The Heathen to destruction bring. Thou hear'st Thy servants humble plaint; Prepar'st their heart, art swift to grant: To judge the poore and fatherlesse, That men of earth no more oppresse. Psal. XI. In God I put my trust: How then Do yee reproachfull men Say, To the mountaines flie my soule, Like to the chased fowle? For lo, the wicked bend their bow, Their deadly shafts to throw; That privily in darknesse they Th' upright in heart may slay. If the foundations perish so, What can the righteous do? But in His Temple God resides, Whose throne in Heaven abides. He all beholds with searching eye, The Sons of men to try. The Lord His righteous servants proves; Hates him oppression loves. He snares, with fire and brimstone showres, Upon the wicked powres: Black tempests are by Him rais'd up, The portion of their cup. For the just God doth those respect Who righteousnes affect. His countenance, and favour bright Beholdeth the upright. Psal. XII. Helpe Lord, for godly men decrease; Goodnesse on earth doth cease: And, like all other Mortals fraile, The faithfull Persons faile. Each to his neighbour vainly speakes, And to deceive him seekes: With fratt'ring Lips, and double hearts, They use deceitfull arts. God shall cut off their guile-full tongues, Puft up with pride and wrongs: Who say, Our words their ends shall gaine: What Lord can us restraine? But for th' oppressions of the poore, Whose sighes their want deplore; Now, saith the Lord, will I arise To ease their miseries. The words, which from the Lord we heare Are pure, and most sincere: As Silver in the fornace try'd, And sev'n times purifi'd. Thou shalt, O Lord, keep Thine Elect, And from this race protect. The wicked live esteem'd, and prais'd, When vilest men are rais'd. Psal. XIII. How long Lord! Wilt Thou me forget Who am with woes beset. Shall I still languish in disgrace, Whil'st Thou dost hide thy Face? How long shall I without reliefe Take counsaile of my griefe? How long wilt Thou my soule expose To hir insulting foes? Consider, Lord! my Prayer heare, When I my hands up-reare. Lighten mine eyes, ere losse of breath Cause me to sleep in death. Lest that mine enemy prevaile, Triumphing when I faile: And those that trouble me be glad, When they behold me sad. But in thy Mercy, Lord, and Grace, My constant trust I place. My glad heart shall rejoyce alone In thy salvation. I will my gratefull Anthems sing Unto the Heavenly King; Who with such bountifull regard His servants doth reward. Psal. XIV. Sing this as Psalme 100. The fool within his heart hath said, There is no God that all things made, Corrupt and wicked are their facts; Nor is there one who goodnesse acts. The Lord from Heaven downe did looke, And view of all mans children tooke: To see if any knowledge sought, Or upon God would place his thought. But all of them are gone aside, And in their filthinesse abide: Throughout their numbers there is none That good performeth; No, not one. Do then all knowledge thus defy Those workers of iniquity? Who eat my people up as bread, And never God have worshipped. Affrighted they, and stricken were With great amaze, and sudden feare. For God amongst the righteous race Is ever present by His Grace. The poore mans counsaile, and his faith Your shamelesse malice mocked hath; Because he God his refuge makes, And sure protection from Him takes. O who, that Israël may live, Salvation will from Sion give? When God shall His from bondage free Then Iacobs race shall joyfull bee. Psal. XV. Lord! who shall in thy dwelling bide Or on Thy Hill reside? Ev'n he whose life, and deeds are right; Whose words in truth delight. He who reviles not with his tongue, Nor doth his neighbour wrong: Who none with slanders doth backbite, Or undeserved spight. Who in his pure, impartiall eyes Vile persons doth despise: But love and honour doth afford To them that feare the Lord. Whose mind not alters, if he sweare, Though he a Iooser were: Nor by extortion wealth contracts, Nor lawlesse use exacts. Nor to betray the innocent For wicked bribes is bent. Who so doth this, shall never move Out of his Makers love. Psal. XVI. Sing this as the Lamentation. Preserve O God, and succour mee, Who put my faithfull trust in Thee. Thou O my Soule to Him hast said, Thou ar't my Lord and only aid. To Thee my goodnes not extends, No merit nor perfection lends. But my delight on Saints is plac'd, By most excelling vertues grac'd. Their sorrowes shall be multiply'd, Who have on other Gods rely'd: To These I no burnt offering, Nor bloody sacrifice will bring; Of them I neither mention make, Nor in my lips their Names will take. Thou only, Who my portion ar't, Shalt have the duties of my heart. God fills my Cup, and doth advance The lot of mine inheritance: My lines in pleasant places lay'd A wealthy heritage have made. Thee therefore will I ever bless, Who gav'st me counsell in distress, And by Thy warnings do'st invite My reines to serve Thee in the night. I set the Lord before mine ey, And hold Him in my memory; Whil'st He assists at my right hand, I stedfast and unmoved stand. This glads my heart, my Glory shall Rejoyce, how low so ere I fall: And in the grave my flesh shall rest, With hope to Rise againe possest. Thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell Eternally condemn'd to dwell; Nor sufferest Thy Holy one In death to see corruption. Thou wilt the path of Life declare, At whose Right Hand and Presence are Such pleasures which no time shall end, And joyes no thought can comprehend. Psal. XVII. Lord heare the right, my cry attend; My pray'r, which lips unfeigned send: Judge me, and with impartiall eye Behold my causes equity. Thou prov'st my heart, and in the night Visit'st, and try'st, and find'st me right. I in my purpos'd thoughts professe, That never shall my mouth transgresse. Thy word hath kept me from mens work And pathes where the destroyer lurkes. Hold up my goings in thy way, That so my footsteps never stray. I call'd on thee, who ar't inclin'd My voyce to heare, my speech to mind. O shew thy kindnes, thou, whose hand Sav'st them that trust, when foes withstand. Keep as the Apple of the eye, And by Thee shadow'd let me lye: From wicked men, and deadly foes, Whose strong oppressions me enclose. For they with fatnes swoll'n, and pride Have compass'd us, and closely ey'd: Like Lions greedy of their prey, Or Lions whelps, they lurking lay. Arise O Lord, and in thy frowne, Both disappoint, and cast him downe. Deliv'rance to my soul afford From wicked men, who are thy sword! From men, I say, who are thy hand, To punish sinners in the land: Whom pleasures of the world enslave And in this life their portion have. Thou giv'st them treasure at their will, Their belly do'st with plenty fill: Who full of Children at their death Their substance to their race bequeath. But I behold Thy glorious sight And presence will in endlesse light; And wak'd from death, with thee abide, With Thy blest likenesse satisfi'd. Psal. XVIII. Sing this as Psalme 51. [First Part] I thee will love, O Lord my pow'r; Thou art my fortresse, rock, and tow'r: My God, my trust, my confidence; My horne of safety, and defence. To God most prais'd I send my Cries, Who saves me from mine enemies: When pangs of circling death prevail'd, And floods of wicked men assail'd. I compass'd am with paines of Hell; The snares of death about me dwell. To God I cry'd, distrest and griev'd; Who from His Temple me reliev'd. The earth then trembled at His wrath, Which Hir foundations shaken hath. A smoake from out His nostrills came, And from His mouth devouring flame. He bow'd the Heavens, and came downe; Beneath His feet was darknesse throw'n: On flying Cherubs He did ride; On wings of Wind through Heaven glide. Thick darknesse His Pavilion made; And watry Clouds the sky orelay'd. Yet at His brightnesse those gave place Whilst haile and fire powr'd down a pace His voyce was heard in thunders loud; And coales fell from the breaking Cloud His shafts dispers'd them, as they flew, Their force His darted lightnings slew. The Oceans Chanell did appear; The world's foundations naked were At Thy rebuke, O Lord, and blast, Which Thy incensed Nostrills cast. He me from many waters tooke, My too strong foes with vengeance strooke They me in day of trouble seiz'd; But God my stay those sorrowes eas'd. He brought me to a spacious place, Deliv'ring me through His free grace He did my righteousnesse regard, And cleannesse of my hands reward. For I the wayes of God have kept; Nor wickedly His precepts left. His judgments I, and statutes, prize; Still placing them before my eyes. I perfect was, and innocent; Nor to ungodly courses bent; Therefore as guiltlesse, and upright, I am rewarded in His sight. Second Part. Thou to the mercifull art kind; And pure, where Thou dost purenesse find. But with the froward art perverse; Dost save the poor, the proud disperse. For thou my candle wilt make bright, And turne my darknesse into light. By Thee I made a Troop to fall; And through my God leap'd ore a wall. God's way is perfect, His word try'd Doth as a shield the faithfull hide. Who can like Him a Saviour be? Or who a Rock to us, but He? Tis God that girdeth me with might, And keepes me in my wayes upright: My feet, like Hind's, He maketh swift, And to high places doth me lift. Tis He doth teach my hands to warre; Steel bowes by them now broken are. Thou wast my shield, Thy hand sustain'd: I through Thy favour greatnesse gain'd. My feet enlarged have not fail'd; 'Gainst foes pursuit my hands prevail'd Whose pride now quite confounded lies Wounded and fall'n, no more to rise. Thou girdest me with strength for fight, And hast subdu'd the rebells might: Their captive necks below me bend, And in deserv'd destruction end. They cry'd for safety, 'midst their fear But God nor help them would, nor hear Like dust blow'n up, so did I beat, And tread them downe in their retreat. From mutiny, and peoples strife O Lord, Thou resku'd hast my life. My head ore Nations Thou dost crown Those serve me, whom I have not known Soone as they heare, they me obay; And strangers stoop unto my sway. The aliens away shall fade, And their close places leave dismai'd Blest be my Rock, who ever lives; Exalt Him, who Salvation gives. Tis God whose vengeance doth pursue And people under me subdue. He saves me from mine enemies, And lifts me up 'bove those that rise. He is my reskue, my defence, From men of blood and violence. Therefore will I to Thee O Lord, My thanks Eternally record: Amongst the Heathen speake Thy fame, And praises sing unto Thy Name. He great deliverance doth bring, In love to His annointed King: His mercies doth on David powre, And on his seed, for evermore. Psal. XIX. The Heavens high declare the fame Of God, who did them frame. One day another tels, and night His wonders doth recite. They have no language, yet they teach, Without or tongue, or speech: And through the earth their sound is gone To every Nation. God in the Circle of those spheares A Tabernacle reares; In which the swift, unweary'd Sun His daily course may run. Who, as a Bridegroome freshly deckt, Doth on the world reflect: And, as a Giant strong in might, Darts forth his piercing light. He breaking from the Easterne skies Doth from his Chambers rise: And till his beames declining set, Nothing can shun his heat. Gods Law is incorrupt, and whole; Converting every Soule. His faithfull promise never dies; And makes the simple wise. The Statutes of the Lord are right, And drooping hearts delight. Both pure, and perfect, His command Gives light to understand. Most unpolluted is His feare, Eternall, and sincere. The judgments of the Lord are fixt; With Truth and Justice mixt. More to be wish'd then golden mines, When them the test refines: And more then hony that distills, The mouth with sweetnesse fills. By These Thy servant warned is, Oft as he goes amisse: Which yeeld a plentifull reward To all that Them regard. Who knowes how often he offends? How far his sin extends? Lord cleanse my Soule from crimes conceal'd, To none but Thee reveal'd. Keep me, that no presumptuous staine May ore Thy Servant reigne. Then shall I walke in innocence, Free from the great offence. O Lord! my only strength and tow'r, Who sav'st me by Thy pow'r; Let all my words, and thoughts, by Thee Heard, and accepted be. Psal. XX. The Lord in thy afflictions day Give eare when thou dost pray. The Name of Iacob's God defend, On whom thy hopes depend. Help from His Sanctuary send, And strength from Sion lend. Thy Gifts in His remembrance prize; Accept thy sacrifice. May He, who comforts doth inspire, Grant thee thy heart's desire: Make thee enjoy thy wishes still; Thy counsailes all fulfill. With thankfull and triumphant voyce We in Thy help rejoyce: And in Thy Name our banners reare, Who wilt thy servants heare. Now know I, God, who power gave, Doth His Annointed save. He heares from Heav'n, and His right hand Makes him in safety stand. Some in their armed Chariots force, Some put their trust in horse: But we remember will the Lord, Whose Name doth strength afford. They are brought down, and fall'n in war We rays'd in triumph are. O save us Lord, great Heavens King, Heare those requests we bring. Psal. XXI. The King shall in Thy strength be glad; Through Thee with safety clad. Thou gav'st him all his heart desir'd, And what his lips requir'd. Thou didst no good from him withhold; Crownd'st him with purest gold. He asked life, and Thou didst give Him endlesse dayes to live. Great Majesty doth him invest, Through Thy Salvation blest. Thou giv'st him joy, and lasting grace, The favour of Thy face. The King on God his trust hath plac't, Whose Mercy keeps Him fast: Thy right hand all Thy foes shall find, Whose hate 'gainst Thee combin'd. Thy wrath shall those, who Thee forsake, A fiery Oven make. The Lord shall swallow them in ire, By His revenges fire. Their fruit shalt Thou destroy from earth, Root out their childrens birth; For they 'gainst Thee did ill invent, Though fayl'd in their intent. When at their face Thine arrowes aime, They turn their back with shame, O Lord! Thy strength and glory raise; So we Thy pow'r will praise. Psal. XXII. Sing this as the Lamentation. My God, My God upon me look; O wherefore hast Thou me forsook Why help'st Thou not, when I implore? Nor hear'st, when I through anguish roare? O God by day to Thee I cry; But Thou Thy audience dost deny: And in the night, when I should sleep, My sorrowes will not silence keep. But Thou in Holinesse dost dwell, O Thou the praise of Israel! Our Fathers plac'd their trust in Thee; And Thy deliverance set them free. They cry'd to Thee, surpriz'd with feare, And from Confusion saved were. But I a worme, and no man am; Reproach of men, and peoples shame. Beholders Me their pastime make, Shoot out their lip, their head they shake. He trusted God, that He would save: See, if from him he safety have. But Thou didst take me from the womb; And ever since my hope become. On Thee, when on the breast I hung, And from the birth, my care was flung. When trouble's neare, O be not far: Since left to me no helpers are. For many bulls with bellowing sound, Strong bulls of Bashan girt me round. They gape like Lions Me about; I am like water powred out. My bones disjoynted torture crackes; My heart within me melts like Waxe. My strength is like a Pot-sheard dry'd; My tongue up to my Palate ty'd. Thou brought'st me down unto the grave: For dogs my life encompast have. Assemblies of the wicked meet; They pierced have my hands and feet: My bones stick out, consum'd and bare; Whil'st they remorselesse on me stare. They now to part my garments hast, And Lots upon my vesture cast. But be not far from me, O Lord; My soule deliver from the sword. My darling save from rav'ning jawes Of dogs, and from the Lions pawes. For thou hast heard me from the hornes Of fierce assayling Unicornes. I to my brethren will proclaime The Praises due to Thy great Name. Yee that fear God, all Iacobs line, And Israëls seed in Prayses joyne. Th' afflicted He did nere despise; Nor hid His face, but heard their cries. My praise, and vowes devout to Thee Shall in thy Church performed be. He to the meeke will plenty give: The hearts, that seek Him, ever live. Far as the world extends it's bound, Religious Converts shall be found. They shall remember, and implore; And ev'ry Kindred Him adore. For God's the Kingdome is, whose sway All Nations of the Earth obay. The rich, who on Earth's fatnesse feed; Ev'n to the Soule that dies for need; All from the throne unto the dust, Before Him bow, and worship must. All these shall serve Him in their seed, And sons to God adopted breed: Who to succession shall proclaime His righteousnesse, and awfull Name. Psal. XXIII. The Lord my Shepheard is, and guide; I shall no want abide. He makes me lye in fruitfull meads, And by stil waters leads. My Soule to danger given ore He doth againe restore; And guides me in the righteous path His Name elected hath. Yea though in vale of darknesse lay'd, Or death's more ghastly shade, I feare no ill: Thy rod, and staffe Direct, and keep me safe. Thou dost for me a plenteous fare Before my foes prepare. Thou dost with oyle annoint my head; My flowing Cup doth shed. Thy mercy sure shall me attend, Untill my Life doth end: And in the House of God will I Remaine Eternally. Psal. XXIV. Earth is the Lords, with hir encrease; And all that there have place. He founded it upon the Seas, And made the floods hir base. Who in God's Holy Place shall stand; Or on His Hill appeare? He, who is pure in Heart, and hand; Nor to deceive doth sweare. He blessings shall from God receive, And righteousnesse from high. This is their race, who God believe, And to His sight are nigh. Lift up yee Gates, lift up your head, Yee Doores Eternall spread: The King of Glory shall come in; And his approach begin. Who is the Great, and Glorious King, Of whom our Praises sing? The Lord in Battaile mighty, This The King of Glory is. Lift up yee Gates, lift up your Head, Yee Doores Eternall spread. The King of Glory shall come in, And his approach begin. Who is the Great, and Glorious King, Of whom our Praises sing? The Lord in Battell mighty, This The King of Glory is. Psal. XXV. With Thoughts lift up to Thee O God my Soule doth flee. To shame O never me expose; Nor triumph of my foes. Let those be free from shame, Who wait upon Thy Name; But let them feele it, who Thy Lawes Transgresse without a cause. Thy wayes unto me shew; Teach me Thy truth to know. Thou art the God do'st me defend; On Thee I still depend. Thinke on Thy mercies Lord! Thy ancient love record. Remember not my sins of youth; But save me in Thy truth. Good is the Lord: His ways To sinners He displaies. The meek He will in judgment guide, Who in His precepts bide. His paths with truth abound; Great mercies there are found: Which He unto all such doth grant, Who keep his Covenant. O for Thy Names sake Lord, Pardon to me afford! And with my heinous crime dispense; For great is mine offence. To him that feares, He shewes The way which he shall chuse; His Soule shall dwell at ease; his race Shall long on earth have place. To them who God do feare, His secret shall appeare. He will His Covenant declare To such as faithfull are. Mine eyes on God are set, Who plucks me from the net. O Lord to me in mercy turne, Afflicted, &amp; forlorne. My heart's distresse is large: O Thou my woes discharge. Looke on the paine wherein I live, And all my sins forgive. Thinke on my many foes, Whose hate most cruell growes. O keep my soule from scandall free, Who put my trust in Thee. Let Justice me defend, Who on Thy grace attend. Thy Israël O God release, And all his troubles ease. Psal. XXVI. Iudge me (O God,) for in Thy path My foot insisted hath. My trust hath on Thee Lord rely'd; Therefore I shall not slide. Examine me (O Lord,) and try; My reines and heart descry. Thy mercy still is in my sight; Thy truth hath kept me right. I have not with vaine persons sate, Or those that use deceit: Ill congregations I detest; Nor am the sinners guest. In innocence Ile wash my hand; So at Thine Altar stand: That I may publish in my Song What thankes to Thee belong. O Lord! devoutly I affect The House Thou dost Elect. I Love the honour of that Place Thy presence deignes to grace. Shut not my soule, nor judge my life, With men of blood and strife: Whose arme it selfe in mischiefe lifts; Whose hand is fill'd with gifts. In mine integrity I goe; Save me, and mercy show. So will I Praise Thee, when my feet Within Thy Temple meet. Psal. XXVII. Sing this as Psalme 51. God my Salvation is, and Light: What terrour then shall me affright? My life's sole strength He is, and aid. Of whom then shall I be afraid? When wicked men, mine enemies, Conspiring did against me rise; When they approach'd my flesh to eat, They stumbling fell in their retreat. Although an host encamped were; My heart their numbers shall not feare. And though a War against me rise, My confidence shall them despise. One thing of God I have desir'd; That I, unto His House retir'd, Might spend my dayes, &amp; there grow old His Temples beauty to behold. For He, when times of trouble threat, Will me in his Pavilion seat; Within His Tabernacle hide, And safety on a rock provide. And now my head up-lifted shall Behold my foes encircling fall: Therefore glad Songs, and sacrifice, With praises to Thy throne shall rise. Heare, (O my Lord,) and when I cry, In mercy to my voyce reply. When Thou command'st: Seek ye my face My heart O Lord, I seek Thee, saies. Hide not Thy face from me in ire; Nor leave me helplesse, I desire: Who, when my Parents me forsake, Wilt me unto Thy favour take. Teach me, O Lord Thy wayes to tread; In pathes of truth and plainnesse lead. Nor leave me to their cruell will, Who raise false witnesse, me to kill. I fainted had, but for beleife, In endlesse life to find releife. Wait on the Lord, of courage be; O wait on Him, will strengthen Thee. Psal. XXVIII. To Thee (O Lord) my Rock, I cry; Forbeare not to reply: Least I be, if Thou silence keep, Like those in death that sleep. Heare Thou the voyce of my request, In accents lowd exprest: When I with lifted hands entreat Before thy Mercy seat. O draw me not with sinners hence, Whose works are Thy offence: Who when their hearts would mischiefe wreake, Peace to their neighbour speake. Give them according to their deeds, And wicked labours seeds: And in the workes they did invent, Render their punishment. Because Gods works they set at nought, And what His hand hath wrought; He cast them to destruction shall; Nor build them when they fall. Blessed be God, who when I pray'd, Became my shield, and aid. Therefore my heart in Songs of Praise With joy His fame shall raise. He His Annointed doth defend; Strength to His Servants send. Thy people save; Thine Heritance To endlesse blisse advance. Psal. XXIX. Yee Mighty in your Race, and Tribe, Glory to God ascribe. In beauty of His holinesse His Name adore and blesse. The Lord by His commanding voyce Brings downe the Waters noyse. The Glorious God the Thunder makes, Which earth's foundation shakes. He rules the Sea with pow'r from high, Dreadfull in Majesty. His voyce, when He in fury speakes, The lofty Cedars breaks. Like sporting Calves the Mountaines skip; Great Lebanon doth leap: And Syrion, by his Motion borne, Like a young Unicorne. His voyce the flames of fire divides, From clouds when Lightning glides. At His rebuke the desart quakes, And barren Kadesh shakes. Bring forth He makes the frighted Hinds; Rends forrests with His Winds And all His glory must declare, Who in His Temple are. God sits above the Watry maine; Doth King for ever reigne. He will His peoples strength encrease, And blesse them long with peace. Psal. XXX. Sing this as the Lamentation. O Lord, I Thee will magnifie; For Thou hast lifted me on high: Nor madest me a scorne to those, Who were my lifes professed foes. O Lord my God, I cry'd to Thee, Who hast in mercy healed me. My Soule Thou broughtest from the grave And from the pit of Hell didst save. O all ye Saints your voyces raise To sing your Makers endlesse praise: Remember still with thankes to blesse, And magnifie His Holinesse. For but a Moment lasts His wrath, His favour life restored hath. Our weeping may endure a night, But joy comes with the morning light. In my prosperity I said, My bases are for ever lay'd: I shall not from my place remove, But stand supported by Thy love. No change of times, or fortunes hate Can overthrow my happy state: For thou my Mountaine mad'st so strong, I shall on earth continue long. Yet whilst exalted in my thought, I was to suddaine trouble brought: And soon as Thou didst hide Thy face, My comforts vanish'd hence apace. Then unto Thee, O Lord, did I With humble supplication cry. I did to God my plaint addresse, Thus powring forth my heavinesse. O Thou most Glorious, most Good, What profit is there in my blood? What triumph canst Thou gaine by it, When I goe downe into the pit? Shall silent dust, or darknesse have A tongue to praise Thee in the grave? Or those, in earth who closed are, From their low Cells Thy truth declare? O Lord Thine eare of mercy lend, And from Thy dwelling succour send. For Thou the cause, for which I mourn'd, Hast into Songs and Dances turn'd. My Sack-cloath Thou didst off me take, And cheerfull robes of gladnesse make: That I Thy praises might renew; To whom incessant thankes are due. Psal. XXXI. Sing this as the Lamentation. In Thee O Lord I put my trust: Save me from shame, as Thou art just. Bow downe Thy gratious eare with speed Be Thou my strong defence at need. For Thou, my Rock, do'st me protect O for Thy Names sake me direct! Pull me from out the dang'rous net Which they for me have closely set. My spirit I to Thee commit, For Thou, O God, did'st purchase it. I hate all those, love vanities; But on the Lord my trust relies. I joy in Thy compassion show'n, Who hast my Soule in trouble know Thou didst from hostile hands discharge To liberty my feet enlarge. Have mercy (Lord) and send reliefe; Mine eye, and soule both wast with griefe Through sin I sigh away my dayes: My bones consume, my strength decayes. My foes reproach, my neighbours fright I am; whilst friends avoid my sight. Like to the dead, I sit forgot, And uselesse, as a broken pot. For I their slander heard, and strife, Who counsaile took against my life. But (Lord!) my trust in Thee is lay'd; Thou art my God, my help, I said. My fleeting times are in Thy hand, Whose short-liv'd date by Thee is span'd. Me never to the pow'r expose, Or hand, of persecuting foes. On me O let Thy favour shine: To save me through Thy grace incline. Thy servant let no shame befall, Who daily on Thy Name doth call. Let wicked men confusion have, Put downe to silence in the grave. And shut the lying lips, that use The just by slanders to traduce. O how great goodnesse hast thou wrought, To those thee fear, whose faith thee sought? Them shalt Thou in Thy presence hide, It safe from mens insulting pride. And from the tongues malitious strife As in a tow'r, defend their life. Blessed be God, whose love endures; Whose strong protection me secures. I said, though in my hast unwise, I am cut off before Thine eyes. Yet hast Thou not my suit deny'd, When in my Pray'r to Thee I cry'd. O Love the Lord, who His regards; And with revenge the proud reward Be bold, since He such grace imparts, To strengthen both your hopes, &amp; hearts. Psal. XXXII. Blessed is he, whose wickednesse To pardon finds accesse: Whose sin, with all he did amisse, Forgot, and cover'd is. Blest is the man, to whom The Lord Imputes no crime abhord: Whose spirit right, whose heart is streight And harbours no deceit. When I my tongue from speech refrain'd, I was with anguish pain'd. My bones wax't old through discontent: My dayes in moanes were spent. Thy hand upon me heavy lay; Not resting night or day. Moisture was to nothing brought, Like fields in Summers drought. Then I to Thee my sin reveal'd, And no offence conceal'd. And, soon as my confession said, My peace with Thee was made. For this to Thee shall prayer sound, What time Thou may'st be found. And shall the floods, which highest goe, Thy servants overflow. Thou art a refuge me to hide From dangers troubled tide: With Songs of Thy delivery I shall encompast ly. I will enforme thy life, and teach, How thou this blisse shalt reach: And with mine eye I thee will guide, Least thou should'st tread aside. Be ye not like the horse, or mule, Whom reason cannot rule: Whose stubborne mouths the bit, and reine From fury must restreine. Great plagues, and paines that never end For wicked men attend. But those, in God their trust who place, Sure mercies shall embrace. Be glad ye righteous, and rejoyce, Who make the Lord your choice. With shouts alowd your joy impart All ye upright in heart. Psal. XXXIII. Yee righteous in the Lord delight; For praise becomes th' upright. Let Harpe and Psaltery's consent, The ten-string'd instrument, New Songs record unto the voyce With their melodious noise. For just Gods promise is to you; And all His workes are true. He righteousnesse and judgment wills All earth his goodnesse fills. The Heav'ns bright host, and all beneath He formed with His breath. He doth the waters of the deep Heap'd in His store-house keep. Let men, and all which earth doth beare, Of Him then stand in feare. He spake, and at His free commands The world unmoved stands. Mens counsailes and devises wrought The Lord will bring to nought. Yet through all ages His decree, And thoughts unchanged be. Blest is the People He protects, And for His Lot elects. The Lord from Heav'n, His dwelling place, Beheld all humane race; Their hearts He fashion'd; whose each thought, And worke to light is brought. No King is sav'd by multitude; Nor man with might endu'd. As vaine for safety is the horse, To reskue by his force. Who feare, and on Gods love relye, Are ever in his Eye; Their Soule to reskue from the grave, And life from famine save. Our soule doth wait for God our sheild; Glad hopes on Him we build. Lord let Thy mercy on us be, As we believe in Thee. Psal. XXXIV. I will at all times blesse the Lord; His praises still record; And whilst my soule of God makes choice The humble shall rejoyce. The Lord with me O magnifie; Exalt His Name on high; I sought Him, who my prayer heard, And sav'd from all I fear'd. They look'd to Him, and light'ned were No shame their faces beare: For God did at the poor man's cry, Relieve his misery. His Angell those environs round, Who in His fear are sound. O tast, and see how good is Hee To such as faithfull be. O fear the Lord, yee Saints of His; For such no blessings misse. Young Lions often lacking prey, With hunger pine away. But those that seek His Covenant No good thing ever want, Come children, hearken to my speech; I you His feare will teach. What man is he, long life doth crave; Or happy dayes would have? Keep thou thy tongue from wicked wile, Thy lips from speaking guile. Depart from ill, in good encrease; Pursue, and seek for peace. For on the just God casts His eyes, His eares admit their cryes. Against the bad He sets his face, To cut them from their place. The righteous cry, and God attends; In trouble safety sends. He doth in broken hearts delight, And saveth soules contrite. Great troubles on the righteous fall, But He releives in all. He keeps the number of each bone; Nor broken shall be one. Transgressors their own mischeifs slay, And with just vengeance pay. All such as doe the righteous hate, Shall soone be desolate. For God His servants soules redeems, And deare their faith esteems. Psal. XXXV. As Psalme 51. Plead (Lord) my cause with striving foes Against them fight who me oppose. The shield for my Protection weare; Draw out Thy all-subduing speare. Stop Thou my persecutors way; Soule, I am thy salvation, say. Let them drove back with shame retire Who to procure my hurt conspire. Like chaffe before the Whirlwinds blast, Let them be by God's Angell chas'd: Darke be their way, their steps untrue; And let His Angel them pursue. For without cause they hid their snare And for my soule did pits prepare. But let themselves surprised all In their contriv'd destruction fall. My soule in God shall joyfull be: My bones all say; who's like to Thee? Who keep'st the poor from suff'ring wrong, And help'st the needy 'gainst the strong. False witnesse did against me rise, And things unknowne to me devise. For good they me reward with ill, To spoile my soule, and life to spill. Yet when they lay in sicknesse cast, I did for them both pray, and fast; As for my friend, or brother borne, Or for my Mother did I mourne. But of my trouble glad they joyn'd: Yea abjects in my scorne combin'd. The mocking hypocrites at feasts, By flowting me, delight the guests. How long wilt Thou looke on, O Lord, Nor reskue to my soule afford? O save me from destructions jawes; My darling from the Lions pawes. Then in the great assembly I Will thanks and praises multiply. Let not insulting foes despise, Or wink upon me with their eyes. They speake not peace, but practise strife, Disturbing those of quiet life. Their mouth 'gainst me they opened wide; Ha ha, our eye hath seene it, cry'd. O Lord! Thou their despight dost see: Nor silence keep, nor absent be. Stirre up Thy selfe, to judgment wake; My cause to Thy protection take. O judge me in Thy truth, least they With joy, We have him swallow'd, say. But let confounding shame them cloath, Who love my hurt, my quiet loath. Let them that favour my just cause, Extoll the Lord with lowd applause; Whose goodnes doth his servant raise: And still my tongue shall speake Thy praise Psal. XXXVI. My heart of the transgressor saith, No fear of God he hath. Himselfe he flatters in conceit, Becomming all mens hate. His mouth doth fraud, and sin devise; He is nor good, nor wise. He mischeife on his bed contrives, By wayes abhorred thrives. Up to the clouds Thy mercies reach; The hills Thy justice teach. Thy judgments (Lord,) who all dost keep, Are like th' un-fathom'd deep. How doth Thy love excell! Thy wing Man-kind ore-shadowing. Thy house to them full plenty brings, Who drinke of Thy pure springs. Thou hast lifes springs, and in Thy sight We shall behold the light. Thy kindnesse, (Lord) and grace impart To the upright in heart. Let not the foot of pride prevaile, Nor wicked hands assaile. Downe are they fall'n who ills devise; And never shall arise. Psal. XXXVII. Sing this as Psalme 51. [First Part] Fret not thy selfe, nor envious be At those that work iniquity. For they shall soon to nothing passe, Cut downe and wither'd like the grasse. Trust in the Lord, be doing good; So shalt thou dwelling have, and food. Delight in Him, and for thy hire, He give thee will thy hearts desire. Commit thy selfe to his sole care, By whom our actions crowned are. Thine innocence Hee'l bring to light, Cleare as the day, or noon-tide bright. Rest them on Him, nor 'gainst those fret Whose wicked projects prosper yet. And cease from wrath; least anger may To greater evils thee betray. For wicked ones are cut away; But good men long on earth shall stay. The Sinners vanish in short space: Though sought, thou shalt not find their place Yet shall the meek unshaken stand, Inheriting the promis'd land: Their blessings here on earth encrease, With plenty crown'd, and lasting peace. Ill men with fury, and despight, By plots would circumvent th' upright. But God shall laugh, and them defie; Whose vengefull day is comming nigh. Their sword is draw'n, their bow is bent, To slay the just, is their intent. But by their sword themselves shall dye And all their bowes shall broken ly. A good mans lot, though small, is more Then wicked rich mens wealthy store. Destruction shall their armes enfold; But God the righteous doth uphold. The Lord accounts the justmens age, And will prolong their heritage; In evill times not sham'd, nor griev'd; In dayes of famine still reliev'd. But Gods enraged enemies Shall vanish as the Smoakes that rise; Dissolv'd, and melted into fume, As doth the fat of Lambs consume. The wicked borrow, but not pay; The good both lend, and give away. Such as be blest, possesse the land; The bad cut off, and cursed stand. Second Part. A good mans steps God orders right, Who doth in His commands delight. Though fallen, he shall rise againe; For God's right hand doth him sustaine. I have been young, and now am old; Yet never did my eyes behold The just forsaken, or unfed; Or see his children beg their bread. He mercy shewes, and lends in need; And ever blessed is his seed. Depart from evill, and doe well; That you with Him may ever dwell. God judgment loves, His Saints not leaves; But sinners of their race bereaves. The just His promis'd land possesse, And dwell in endlesse Happinesse. In judgment, and discourses wise A righteous mouth will exercise. Gods Law doth in his heart abide, Nor shall his goings ever slide. Though wicked persons daily wait, To shed his blood confederate; God lets him not condemned ly, Or by a wrongfull sentence dy. Wait on the Lord, and keep His way; That He to life exalt thee may: When thou the wicked men shalt see Cut off, and quite extinguish'd be. I in great pow'r have ill ones seen, Like spreading Lawrells fresh and green. Yet pass'd he by, and soon was gone; Not found againe, nor thought upon. Marke the upright, the just intend; For such a man in peace shall end. But sinners, to destruction cast, Are in their death cut off at last. God to the righteous help doth raise; He is their strength in troubled dayes. His aid shall save them from th' unjust; Because in Him they plant their trust. Psal. XXXVIII. Sing this as the Lamentation. Lord! let me not in anger wast, Nor Thy rebukes in fury tast. Thy piercing arrowes deeply wound; Thy pressing hand doth me confound. My sickly body finds no ease, Because my sinne doth Thee displease. Nor will that guilt Thou dost detest Afford my troubled conscience rest. My sins, like to a torrent grow'n, My sinking head have overflow'n. They burthen me with care, and feare; And are become too great to beare. My sores, and wounds corrupted smell, My foule offence, and folly tell: Bow'd downe with trouble, and forlorne, By night I wake, by day I mourne. My loynes diseas'd, my flesh unsound; And all my body seems one wound. I feeble am, with anguish broake, And roare beneath Thy heavy stroak. O Lord, Thou know'st my whole desire; My hidden groanes to Thee aspire. My heart doth pant, my vigour dies; Of light deprived are mine eyes. My friends, who late professed love, Far from my sore themselves remove. My kindred my converses shun; Nor come to comfort, but look on. They, who my life seek to ensnare, Intent upon my mischiefes are. With foule reproaches, and false lies, My ruin daily they devise. But I, as those nor heare, nor speake, Did never into passion breake: No angry murmur from me fell, Which might my griefes impatience tell For I in Thee my trust repose, To heare my moane, and quell my foes. Who, when my foot amisse did goe, Triumphed at my overthrow. With woes opprest I daily fall, My sorrowes are continuall: And whilst my faults are in my view, They do as oft my paine renew. I therefore will those sins confesse, And with contrition beg redresse. I will the guilt of my offence Wash off with teares of penitence. O Lord! mine enemies are strong, And live to do me further wrong. Each day their number doth encrease, Who are the haters of my peace. They also have against me stood, Who make returnes of ill for good: Yet know no cause for their despight, But that I follow what is right. Therefore my sad request I make, That Thou wilt never me forsake. My God! O never far depart, Who my releife, and comfort art. My sighs, and sorrowes look upon, Thou God of my salvation: Afford thy help in time of need, And to my reskue come with speed. Psal. XXXIX. I said my wayes I will intend, And least my tongue offend, My mouth shall bownd and bridled bee, Whilst I the wicked see. I dumb awhile and silent stood, Ev'n ceasing to speak good; Untill at last my grieved heart Was urg'd with sorrowes smart: So that my heated breast became For lack of vent a flame; And then my tongue these words exprest, Breath'd forth from my disrest. Lord! Let me understand my end, How farr my dayes extend; That I may know how I am fraile, Each moment apt to faile. Behold Thou mad'st the dayes of man No longer then a span: His age as nothing is, and he At best but vanitie: Man like a shadow walkes in vaine, Wasting his time with paine; He heapes up riches, yet not knowes What heire shall them dispose. And now O Lord! on whom shall I Whilst I stay here rely? Truly my hope shall wait on Thee, My joyes there treasur'd be. Deliver me when I transgresse, And help me in distresse; Let not the foolish me deride, Or scorne me in their pride. Under Thy scourge I silent lay Prepared to obay: I did not murmur at my paine, Or of Thy hand complaine. Yet now Thy mercies I invoke, To take away Thy stroke; For I consume, and my faint breath Is yeelding up to death. When Thou for sin dost man correct, Rebuking his neglect, Thou mak'st his beauty soone consume Like to the wandring fume. Sicknese destroyes him, as a moath Corrodes and frets the cloath. So vaine is man, and quickly gone Into corruption. Lord heare my cry! let not thine eares Be deaf unto my teares: For I with Thee a stranger am, And but to sojourne came. O spare my time a little length, Till I recover strength, Before I goe from this worlds shore, And shall be seene no more. Psal. XL. Sing this as Psalme 51. I patient did for God attend, Who to my cry His eare did lend: From horror's pit He did me pluck, And miry clay wherein I stuck. And on the rock He set my feet, From whence my goings nere should fleet My mouth new songs of praises fill; That men may feare, and trust Him still The man most happy is, and blest, Whose constant faith on God doth rest: And never will the proud ones prize, Nor such as turne aside to lies, Lord! many are Thy wonders wrought, And loving towards us is Thy thought: If I would speak and them declare, They more then can be numbred are. No sacrifice Thou did'st desire, Nor sin-oblation burnt in fire. Thou pierc'd, and open'd hast mine eare; To shew what gifts more pleasing were:) Then said I; Lo, I come: Of old The volume of the booke foretold: Lord! I to do Thy will delight; Yea in my heart Thy Law I write. Thy righteousnesse my lips did teach, Thy truth in great assemblies preach: Thy word I hid not, or conceal'd; But unto men Thy love reveal'd. Thy tender mercies nere remove, But still preserve me in Thy love: For more in number then my haires My sin-prest soule is vext with cares. Be pleas'd to save, and keep me fast; O Lord! to give me help make hast. Let them confounded be with shame, Who at my soules destruction aime. Let them repulsed backe retire, Who wish my fall, or hurt desire. Let them be sham'd, and desolate, Who, Fy upon thee, say in hate. Let all that seek Thy glorious Name, Their joyes and comforts loud proclaim Let all, who Thy salvation love, Say alwayes, Prais'd be God above. Though poore, and needy I am brought Thou not exclud'st me from Thy thought Thou my redeemer art, &amp; stay; My God! O make no long delay. Psal. XLI. Sing this as the Prayer after the Commandements. Blessed is he, the poor who minds; He help from God in trouble finds The Lord preserves, and life supplies, Nor gives him up to enemies. When languishing upon his bed, By God he shall be strengthened: By Thee, when weak and lowest layd, His bed is in his sicknesse made. I said, my soule in mercy save; For, (Lord,) 'gainst Thee I sinned have. My foes thus speak: When shall he dy? And loose both Name, and Memory? Even those, to see me who resort, When gone, traduce me in report. My haters whisper, and devise To hurt me in their calumnies. Sick of a fowle disease he lies, Say they,) and never more shall rise: Yea my near friend, who eat my bread, Lifts up his heel to spurne my head. Lord! raise me from this wofull plight, That I their malice may requite. I shall in this Thy favour know, If not triumphed by my foe. Thou do'st my innocence sustaine, And in Thy presence me retaine. Blest be the God of Iacob then Through all enduring times: Amen. Psal. XLII. As the chas'd Hart distrest with heat, Flies to the Brookes retreat: O God! my soule pursu'd, and faint, So after Thee doth pant. My soule, to care and sorrow curst, For God doth hourely thirst. When shall I come Thy presence neare, And in Thy sight appeare? But teares, which day and night did fall I had no meat at all: While they, where is thy God do cry, On whom thou dost rely? Remembring this, my soule I powre, And those glad times deplore, When to Thy house we throng'd with praise To keep Thy Holy daies. Why, O my soule, art thou perplext? My heart cast downe and vext? Hope thou in God, and praise Him still, Whose help up-raise thee will. O God, my soule cast downe with greife, Within finds no releife. From Jordan yet and Hermons hill I thee remember still. One deep upon another calls, At Thy loud Water-falls: Thy waves, and billowes highest run, All over me have gone. The Lord yet sends His favours ray; To shine on me by day: And I my songs and Pray'rs all night Send to the God of light. To God Ile say, My Rock, and strength! Am I forgot at length? Before my foes why do I mourne, Oppressed, and forlorne? At their reproach, with scoffing mixt, I am with swords trans-fixt: Whilst flouting at my misery, Where is Thy God? they cry. Why, O my soule, art thou perplext? My heart cast downe, and vext? Hope thou in God, and praise Him still; Whose help up-raise thee will. Psal. XLIII. Iudge me (O Lord) and plead my cause With them that know no Lawes. Deliver me from the unjust, In fraud and wrong that trust. Thou (God!) canst only me protect: Why dost Thou me reject? Why goe I thus in mourning drest, By enemies opprest? O send Thy Glorious beams of light, Thy truth to keep me right? That of Thy holy dwellings I May make discovery. Then will I to Thy altar bring A joyfull offering: And on the harp my ditties raise, To celebrate Thy praise. Why droop'st thou, O my Soule, so fast Downe in thy sorrowes cast? Or wherefore, my afflicted heart, Thou so disturbed art? Trust in the Lord: for I will praise, And thank Him, all my dayes. Who cures, and crownes lifes short annoyes With never ending joyes. Psal. XLIV. Sing this as the Lamentation. O God! our fathers have us told, What Thou hast done in times of old. Thou drav'st out Nations by Thine hand, To plant Thy people in their land. 'Twas not their arme, or sword, which got Those faire possessions for their lot: But thy right hand, thine arme of might, Because in them Thou took'st delight. O glorious God! Thou art my King: Deliverance to Iacob bring. Through Thee we will our enemies, And those tread downe, who 'gainst us rise. For in my bow I will not trust; 'Tis not my sword deliver must: But Thou hast sav'd us by Thy Name, And all that hate us put to shame. In God all day we make our boasts, And praise Thy Name, great Lord of hoasts But Thou hast left and cast us low, Nor with our Armies forth dost goe. Thou makest us our backs to turne; Whilst they, which hate us, spoile &amp; burne Thou gav'st us to the Heathens pow'r Like sheep, to scatter and devoure. Thou do'st Thy People sell for nought, Not richer, when the price is brought: Thou makest us our neighbours scorne, Laugh'd at, and with reproaches torne: We are a by-word all about; The Heathen shake their head, &amp; flout, I ly confounded with disgrace, And shame hath covered my face. By reason of their vengfull pride, Who Thee blaspheme, and me deride; All this we beare: yet have we not Thy selfe, or Covenant forgot. Our heart revolting turnes not back Nor do our feet Thy waies forsake Though 'mongst the dragons broken sore And with death's shadow cover'd o'er. If we our God forgotten have; Or unto Idols worship gave: Shall not his search the sin impart, Who knowes the secrets of each heart? Yea for Thy sake so ill we fare, We all the day-long killed are: Counted as sheep for shambles bred, Fit only to be slaughtered. Awake (O Lord!) why do'st Thou sleep? Still wilt Thou us at distance keep? Why hidest Thou Thy face from those, Wholy opprest, and griev'd by foes? Our soule unto the dust is throw'n, To earth our belly cleaveth downe. Arise, our life from ruin take; And save us for Thy mercies sake. Psal. XLV. My heart good matter doth indite, Which of the King I write. And like a ready pen, my tongue Frames hir triumphant song. Thou fairer art then humane race; Thy lips are full of grace. Therefore thy God on thee doth powre His blessings endlesse store. Gird on thy sword, O great in might! For Truth, and Justice fight. That all the world may understand The terrour of Thy hand. Thy sharp'ned arrowes wound all those, Who dare the King oppose: Whereby subdued at Thy call, The vanquisht people fall. Thy throne, O God, doth still endure; Thy Scepter just, and pure: Thou righteousnesse do'st value best, And wickednesse detest. Therefore thy God hath Thee preferr'd, And by a love unheard, The oyle of gladnesse on Thy head, Above Thy fellowes, shed. Myrrhe, Aloës, and Cassia's smell Upon Thy garments dwell, Out of the Ivory Palaces Provided Thee to please. King's daughters were amongst Thy train Nor to attend disdaine, The Queen, upon Thy right hand plac'd, With gold of Ophir grac'd. Hearken O Daughter, and give eare: Forget thy parents deare: The King shall prize thy beauty more; Whom, as thy Lord, adore. Rich Tyre with gifts and presents great Thy favour shall entreat. Who, far above Thy beauties seen, All glorious art within. Shee in a robe with needles wrought, Shall to the King be brought. The Virgins which upon hir wait, Shall add unto Thy State. With joy and gladnesse they resort, To enter the Kings Court: Thou shalt have sons, in Father's stead; And many Princes breed. In all succeeding times Thy Name Shall mention'd be with fame; Whilst the glad people Thy renowne: With endlesse praises crowne. Psal. XLVI. Sing this as Psalme 51. God is our refuge; our defence Rests wholly on His providence: Which still affords a present aid, When greatest troubles us invade. Therefore we shall not need to feare, Though the fixt earth removed were: Or though the hills, and mountaines steep Lay buried in the angry Deep. Although the roaring waters make The Mountaines with their swelling shake Yet calmer rivers do embrace Gods City, His faire dwelling place. Whose Tabernacles, by His love, Are kept that they can never move. For He, when dangers Hir distresse, His early succour shall addresse. The Nations rage; the Kingdomes are Disturb'd with strife, and threats of warre But He the tempest can allay, And cause the earth to melt away. The Lord of Hosts doth us direct; Great Iacobs God doth us protect: Come see, on those our mischeifs wrought, What desolations He hath brought. He maketh strife, and wars to cease; And crowns the bleeding earth with peace: He breaks the bow, and crackes the speare; In fire the Chariots burned were. Lo, this is God, whose awfull sway Both earth, and Heaven must obey. The Lord of Hosts doth us direct; Great Iacobs God doth us protect. Psal. XLVII. O clap your hands, All earth throughout To God in triumph shout. His greatnesse rules the world from high, With awfull Majesty. He Nations under us subdues; And will our portion chuse; Which doth in glory far excell; The Lot of Israël. God is gone up with showting voice, And sounding trumpets noyse. Unto our God loud praises sing; Sing praises to our King. To Him, whose pow'r the earth doth fill, With knowledge sing, and skill: Who on His sacred throne remaines, And ore the Heathen reignes. The Princes with the People joyne, Sprung out of Abra'm's loyne. For all are in His care enroll'd, Who highly is extoll'd. Psal. XLVIII. Great is the Lord, His praise is great, In Salem His blest seat. Mount Sion beauteous is for site, The spatious earth's delight. Upon the sides which Northward rise, The Great King's City lies. God in hir Palaces alone Is for a refuge know'n. For lo, the Kings assembled were, Hir glories downe to teare: They saw with marvail hir defense, In trouble hasting thence. They were surpriz'd with sudden feare, Like pangs which women beare. Thou break'st the Ships from Tarshish saile With Thy strong Easterne gale. In Salem, unto God endear'd, We saw, what oft we heard: The Lord of Hosts will hir defend, And stablish to the end. Lord in Thy Temple to our thought We have Thy mercies brought. O God, according to Thy Name, So endlesse is Thy fame. Thy hand is full of righteousnesse. Let Sion joy expresse. Let Iudah's daughters gladly sing The judgments of their King. Walk round about faire Sions Mount; Hir stately Tow'rs recount; Hir Bulwarks marke, and structures well, And to your Children tell. For here the Lord our God intends, Till time expired ends, His favours on This place to breath, And guide us unto death. Psal. XLIX. As Psalme 51. All people of the world give eare; Low, high, rich, poore, togither heare! My mouth of wisedome shall dilate; My heart deep knowledge meditate. To Parables I will encline, Darke sayings on the harp divine. Why should my end affrightment feel, When sin, or death assault my heel? Who trust in wealth, and riches boast, Cannot redeeme a brother lost; Or bring back life, when fled away; Or unto God his ransome pay; (The soule so pretious is, no rate Can it recall, or expiate:) That so he might for ever last, And not of earth's corruption tast. For he perceiveth that the wise, Like to the foole, and brutish dies: And all the wealth, which they have got Must then become anothers lot. Yet they suppose their dwelling place Shall last through each succeeding race; And to their lands their names bequeath, To keep them living after death. Man nerethelesse to honour brought, Like beasts that perish, comes to nought. Thus their vaine folly ends; yet they, Who them survive, praise all they say. Like sheep, they in the grave are layd, For death to feed on, dishes made. The just in light eternall reignes, Whilst others pomp in dust remaines. But God my soule shall take, and save From power of the wide-mouth'd grave. Be not thou troubled, or afraid, When one of these is wealthy made: Or when with plenty fill'd, and ease, His houses glory doth encrease. He carries nothing when he dies, But stript of all his honour lies. Though living, he his soule did blesse; Applauding his false happinesse: And men that course in worldings praise, Which most the appetite obaies. He with his fathers ends in night, And never more shall see the light. Man, who in honour nothing knowes, From hence, like beasts that perish, goes. Psal. L. To the proper Tune. The God of might, Unto the earth did call, From the Suns light To his declining fall. From Sion faire The Lord himselfe hath shone, God shall repaire, In noise and terrour know'n. Usher'd with Flame Wrapt in a stormy cloud, He shall proclaime To earth his judgment lowd. My Saints collect To me with offrings sworne; Heav'ns shall detect The justice by Him borne. My people heare, O Israel, I speak, And witnesse beare 'Gainst thee, my Lawes dost break. I not reprove Thy sacrifices faile, No goates I love, Nor Bullocks from thy stall. Mine is each beast Which the wild Forrests feed, Ev'n to the least Which thousand hils doe breed: The fowles I know Which on the Mountaines fly, The wild beasts owe Which in the desart ly. If I would eat, I need not tell it thee; The whole worlds meat, And it, belongs to me. That I require Bulls flesh, why should'st thou think, Burnt in the fire? Or blood of goats would drink? Thanksgivings bring, And pay to God thy vowes; This offering He as the best allowes: And on Me call In thine afflicted dayes, I save thee shall, And thou shalt give Me praise. But to the bad (Saith God) why should you dare, The Lawes I made, Or Statutes to declare? Why doe ye vaunt In your un-hallow'd mouth, My Covenant? Whose hearts instruction loath. Thou did'st consent When thou a thief hadst seen: Thy foule intent Hath with adult'rers been. Thou to all ill Thy mouth do'st dedicate, Thy false tongue still Is uttering deceit: Thou do'st back-bite, To work thy brothers shame, And full of spight Thy Mothers sonne defame. This hast thou done, And whilst I silent sate, Thou thought'st Me one Who had, like thee, forgate. But I will hast, And order'd 'fore thine eyes Present at last All these impieties. Consider ye! Who God, nor judgment fear, Least anger'd He Your soules in pieces teare. Who offers praise, Me honours; and th' upright, After earthes dayes, Shall dwell in endlesse light. Psal. LI. To the proper Tune. Have mercy, O my God! on me Who thus dejected fly to Thee: According to Thy boundlesse love The weight of mine offence remove. From Thine un-wasted pitties spring Thy wonted streames of pardon bring. O wash my leprous soule againe, And cleanse me from this bloody staine. In sad repentance I confesse The knowledge of this wickednesse: Against Thee have I sinn'd alone, Who art my Judge, for what is done. I cannot hide the blood I spilt, Nor will excuse my secret guilt. That at Thy bar when I am try'd, Thy sentence might be justify'd. Brought forth I was to Parents scorne, In sin conceiv'd, with sorrow Borne; And have emprov'd, by act and thought, Those spots which to the world I brought But Thou dost inward truth require, And only can'st that grace inspire: Thou therefore shalt, who wisdome art With understanding fill my heart. Purge me with Hyssop, then my soule Shall cleansed be, though nev'r so foule. Wash me, and my black crimes will grow More white, then is the falling snow. Make me to hear Thy mercies voice, So shall my broken bones rejoyce. Turne from my sinnes Thy face away, Nor let them in remembrance stay. Create (O God!) a cleansed heart, Renew my soule, chast thoughts impart, Me from Thy presence never drive, Nor of thy guiding grace deprive. Restore Thy comfort yet at last, And let Thy spirit keep me fast: Then wicked men thy wayes Ile teach, And sinners shall conversion reach. Deliver me from guilt of blood, O God Thou Authour of my good. Open my lips, enlarge my tongue; And then thy prayses shall be sung. Thou do'st not sacrifice desire, Or any offring made by fire. The sacrifices God delight, Are broken hearts, and soules contrite. O cast thy favourable eye On Sions low calamity: Build up neglected Salems wall, Whose Structures now to ruin fall. Then shalt Thou be, when once appeas'd, With our devout oblations pleas'd: Who heapes of Incense up will fling, And bullocks to Thine Altar bring. Psal. LII. Why boasting Tyrant dost thou threat Thou canst do mischeife yet? Gods constant goodnesse will prevent Thy murtherous intent. Thy tongue suggestions doth devise; Like rasors cut thy lyes. Thou evill more then goodnesse lov'st; Deceit, not truth, approv'st. Thy words, false tongue, mens lives devour But God shall, by His pow'r, Pluck thee from earth thy dwelling place Thy name from heaven rase. The just these judgments see, and feare, Which wicked ones must beare: And all their malice vainly try'd With laughter shall deride. Lo, this is he who God not chose For his assur'd repose: But strong in violence, and stealth, Rely'd upon his wealth. Yet I within God's house shall be Like a green Olive tree: And on Thy mercy all my daies My confidence will raise. I for this preservation will My praises offer still; And on Thy saving Name await, Which Saints must celebrate. Psal. LIII. The fool, whole heart doth truth upbraid, There is no God, hath said. Corrupted is with sin their mind; And none to good enclin'd. God His survay from Heaven took, And downe on men did look; To see, if any Him would know, Or seek His truth below. But now revolted every one To filthinesse is gone: His Law by none is understood; There is not one doth good. Will they all knowledge thus defy, That work iniquity? Who eat my people up as bread; Nor God have worshipped. He by false fear, and vaine affright, Their bones hath scatter'd quite. Through Gods just vengeance, and despise In shame their glory lies. O that from Sion help were sent, To end our banishment! For Iacobs Off-spring then in peace Should joy in their release. Psal. LIV. Save me (O God,) and by Thy might, With judgment do me right. Be Thou to my request attent, My words in sorrow sent. For 'gainst my soule Oppressors rise; Strangers, who thee despise. But thou my help, and champion art, For those that take my part. With sure revenge He shall repay, And cut my foes away. Free off'rings then to thee shall flame; And I will praise Thy Name. His goodness me from trouble saves, And gives them timelesse graves. Mine eye on those sees his desire, Who did my fall conspire. Psal. LV. Sing this as the Lamentation. Give eare (O God) unto my pray'r, From my request not hidden far. Attend to me with crying faint, Who lowdly mourne in my complaint. Because my foes injurious voyce Mine innocence decryes with noyse; And bad oppressors That impute, Which doth their wrath and hatred suit. My heart within me, sore with paine, Death's falling terrours doth sustaine; Cold feare and trembling me dismay'd: Orewhelm'd with horrour, thus I said: O that I were with wings possest, Like doves to fly, and be at rest: Lo, then far-off I wander might, And to the desart take my flight. I from the windy storme would hast, And this fierce tempest 'scape at last. Destroy, (O Lord!) their tongues divide: For in the City strife I spy'd. Both day and night the walls they round, Wherein all mischeifes do abound: In midst whereof foule sins do meet, Deceit and guile in ev'ry street. No open foe did me traduce; For then I could have borne th' abuse: No publicke hate 'gainst me reveal'd; Then should I have my selfe conceal'd. But it was Thou, my friend, my guide In equall conversation try'd. We in sweet counsail daies had spent, And to Gods house togither went. O let some unexpected death, Strange, as unlook't for, seize their breath, Let them go down alive to hell; For wickednesse with them doth dwell. But I upon the Lord will call, Who saves me from their plotted fall At ev'ning, morning, and mid-day To Him that heares me will I pray. He resku'd hath in peace my life; Deliver'd from their bloody strife Who were in battail opposite: For many then for me did fight. Afflictions shall on them lay hold, By God impos'd, who 'bides of old. Because they in no changes were, They grow secure, and God not feare. He hath put forth his hand 'gainst These Who were enleagu'd with him in peace: His friendly vow he did recant, And break his solemne Covenant. His speeches smooth as butter are; But in his heart is cruell war: More soft then Oyle his flatt'ring words; Yet were they sharper then draw'n swords. Upon the Lord thy burden cast; Who shall sustaine, and keep thee fast. But thou (O God) shalt bring them down, In pit of wide destruction throw'n: Men treacherous, of blood, and strife, Shall find long troubles, and short life; Nor halfe their daies compleated see: But I will ever trust in Thee. Psal. LVI. Sing this as Psalme 51. Be mercifull, O God! to me: For Man combines to swallow me. He daily doth against me fight, By Power to oppresse my right. My watchfull enemies each houre My life assaile and would devoure. O Thou most High! they many are, Who have conspired in this war. Yet though encompast, and afraid, I fly for shelter to Thy aid. For trusting in Gods word, and arme, I know no flesh can do me harme. They still my words, and meaning wrests Close mischeife plotting in their breasts, They joyne themselves, my steps they mark, To overthrow me in the dark. Shall they escape? Lord, in thy frowne Defeat their plots, and cast them downe. My wand'ring steps, and each loose thought Must be unto Thy Audit brought: Thou bott'lest all the tears I shed; My sighs are book'd, and numbered. Soone therefore as to Thee I cry, I know my foes shall faint, and fly. God only is my trust, and joy: I fearlesse am of mans annoy. To Thee, O Lord, Ile pay my vow; My knees in thanks to Thee shall bow. For thou my life keep'st from the grave, And do'st my feet from falling save: That with the living in Thy sight I may enjoy Eternall light. Psal. LVII. Sing this as the Lamentation. Be mercifull (O God!) to me, Whose soule doth only trust in Thee. To Thy wing's shadow will I hast, Till these calamities be past. My cry to God I will advance, Who alway sends deliverance. His mercy saves me from their pow'r, Who would both life, and fame devour. My soule 'mongst Lions is untam'd; Ev'n sons of men with hate enflam'd: Whose teeth are spears, &amp; darts; whose words More piercing, &amp; more sharp then swords. O God! above the earth, or sky, Exalted be Thy Majesty! For my greiv'd soule they nets prepare; But in their own pits fallen are. My heart (O God) my heart is fixt; I'le Anthems sing with praises mixt. Awake my Glory, harp awake; I early will addresses make. Thou 'mongst the Nations shalt be prais'd. Whose mercy to the clouds is rays'd. O God! above the earth, or sky, Exalted by Thy Majesty. Psal. LVIII. Sing this as Psalme 51. O Congregation speake ye right? O sons of men judge ye upright? Your hearts containe, and hands dispense Only full weight of violence. The wicked men, to life when come, Estranged are, ev'n from the womb; They goe astray, though newly borne, They utter lies with lips forsworne. Like Serpents they their poyson bear; And like deafe adders stop their eare; Which will not heare th' enchanters spell, Although he charme them nere so well. Break thou their teeth (O God) which hang Like the young Lions Sharpned fang. Let them like melting waters ly; And cut their arrowes as they fly. Be they like snailes consum'd to slime; Or womens births before their time. Quicker then thornes enkindled blaze, Let whirlwinds blow them from their place. This sight shall joyfull make the good, To wash their feet in wicked blood. So men shall say, from God are had Rewards for just ones, plagues for bad. Psal. LIX. Sing this as the Lamentation. From enemies (O God!) defend, Whose bloody plots in murther end. Lo, for my Soule they ly in wait; The mighty are confederate. Yet is it not for my offence, They thus prepare to take me hence. Awake, (O Lord) behold my wrong; Thy help withhold not from me long. O Lord! Thou God of Hosts awake; Of all the Heathen vengeance take: Let not Thy grace to them extend, Who with malitious hearts offend. Like dogs they come, when day is done, Which snarling through the City run: Behold they belch out daring words; And in their lips they carry swords. For who (say they) our acts shall heare? Or hinder us, when we appeare? But Thou (O Lord) shalt them deride, And strike the heathen in their pride. O Lord! my trust awaites on Thee, Who by Thy strength shall guarded be. Gods saving mercy me prevents; Mine eye shall see their ill events. Disperse them (Lord, my sheild!) not slay; Least it forget my people may. Let their mouthes sin themselvs confound: Themselves their lyes and curses wound. Great King! consume them in thine ire; Let them like dogs at night retire, Still wand'ring up and down for meat; And grudge, when lacking what to eat. But of Thy pow'r my lips shall sing; Yea long before the day doth spring, My thankfull hymnes shall sound aloud The Mercy Thou to me hast show'd. Thou art in trouble my defense, A refuge for my innocence. To Thee O God my strength Ile sing, For Thou dost help, and mercy bring. Psal. LX. Lord! Thou hast scatter'd us abroad, We have strange countries troad; O turne, and let our wand'ring feet In our own dwellings meet. The trembling earth is rent by warrs, And broke in factious jarrs: Heale Thou the breach Thy fury makes, For our foundation shakes. With cares Thou hast Thy people fed, And to amazement led. Thou minglest Thy Revenges cup, And we have drunk it up. Yet thou thy banner hast display'd, To gather those that stray'd. Thy truth and wonted pity shall Our banishment recall. That therefore Thy belov'd may be From all invasion free, Thy right hand for their safety reare, And their petitions heare. God by his Truth did oft professe, He would his servants blesse. I will divide faire Shechem's soile, And Suecoth's valley spoile. Manasseh, Gilead, both are mine; In war shall Ephraim shine. But Iudahs Scepter all must awe, And give my people Law. Moab shall be a dunghill grow'n; Proud Edom overthrow'n: Philistia's boasted triumphs shall Be buried in hir fall. Who me will to the City lead, Fierce Edoms strength, and head? That I may break hir fensed gate, And trample on hir state. O Thou my God who cast'dst us off, And mad'st our force their scoffe, Wilt not Thou with our armies go, To quell th' insulting foe? From trouble save us once againe: For help of man is vaine. Through God we shall in battail rise, And foyle our enemies. Psal. LXI. Give eare, O God! unto my cry; My Prayer not deny; When through the earth in exile throw'n To Thee I make my moane. Thou to that rock of strength shalt lead My care oppressed head; Who art my shelter and defense Against all violence. Within Thy Tabernacle I Will dwell eternally; Whilst my unshaken hopes endure, Under Thy wing secure. For Thou O God hast heard my vow; Thou my desire dost know: From whom the heritages came To those that feare Thy Name. Thou shalt preserve the King in peace, And give His yeares encrease: That He within Thy gratious sight May dwell in endlesse light. Thy mercy, and Thy truth prepare; Which his preservers are. So to Thy Name Ile praises sing, And vowes performed bring. Psal. LXII. My soule doth wait on God alone, Whence comes salvation. He is my Rock; firm'd in His love, I shall not greatly move. How long will mischiefe ye devise? Swift death shall you surprise. Ye shall be like a bowing wall, Or tott'ring fences fall. For they consult to cast him downe, Whom God lifts to renowne: They blessings with their mouth impart, But curses from their heart. My soule wait Thou on God alone, My expectation. He is my Rock, my safe defense; I shall not move from hence. In God my health and glory rest, My strength and refuge blest. Trust Him, ye people, and implore; Your heart before Him powre. The sons of men, both low, and high, Are lyes, and vanity: And all alike in ballance lay'd, Weigh lighter then the shade. O never in oppression trust, Nor robberies unjust. If wealth encrease, your heart nere set Upon the gaines you get. God once hath spoke, and oft I heard, His pow'r is to be fear'd: And that His Mercy doth dispense Each work its recompense. Psal. LXIII. O God, Thou art my God; to Thee My thoughts addressed be. And early as the rising day, I will before Thee pray. My thirsting soule, and longing flesh Beg, Thou wilt them refresh, In that dry land, where fruits nere grow, Nor streams of water flow. That in Thy Sanctuary I May see Thy Majesty; And Thy bright glory may behold, As I had seen of old. Thy loving kindnesse better is, Then life, or earthly blisse: My lips shall therefore praises give, And blesse Thee, whilst I live. Thus unto Thee, whose Name is fear'd, My hands shall be up-reard. My soule is as with marrow cloy'd; When thus my mouth's employ'd. I Thee remember on my bed, With crosses wearied: And in the watches of the night, Thy goodnesse I recite. Under the shadow of Thy wing To Thee, my Help, I sing: My soule on Thee alone depends; Whose Right hand me defends. But those that would my Soule enslave, Shall sinke into the grave. The killing sword their lives shall slay, Or make them foxes prey. The King in God his joy shall beare, With those that by Him sweare: When all the mouthes of such as ly, Stop'd, and confounded dy. Psal. LXIV. My voice in Pray'r, O God, intend; My life from foes defend. Me from all wicked counsails shrowd, And risings of the proud. Whose tongues full bent, and whet like swords, As darts, shoot bitter words: That fearlesse, and in secret they The perfect man may slay. In mischiefe they encourage each; Of snares make private speech; Which when in secret lay'd, They cry, What eyes shall them descry? They both contrive, and practise ill, Most diligent to kill: Which in their heart concealed deep Their thoughts in secret keep. But God shall with a suddaine dart Wound their malitious heart: So their own tongue betray them shall, As causer of their fall. Then those deride them shall, that see, And from their vengeance flee: All men shall feare, and thence declare, God's work these judgments are. For wisely they consider on, And ponder what is done. In God rejoyce then shall the just, And glory in His trust. Psal. LXV. Thy praise (O God!) in Sion flowes, Where we performe our vowes. O Thou that hear'st our prayers summe, To Thee all flesh shall come. My misdeeds (Lord) 'gainst me prevaile; Thy mercies though nere faile: Who our transgressions from thy sight Remov'st, and purgest quite. Blest is the man Thou do'st admit Within Thy Courts to sit: For with Thy Temples beauty he Shall satisfied be. O God of our salvation! Thou Wilt dreadfull wonders show! Thou hope of all earth's bounds containe, Or far dilated Maine. Whose strength the mountaines setteth fast, On their foundation plac't: Who doth the roaring Seas asswage, And still the People's rage. They, in earth's utmost parts that dwell, Thy fearfull tokens tell: Thou mak'st th' outgoings of the morne, And nights thy praise adorne. Thou waterest the earth with raine, Then giv'st hir store of graine. Such plenty Gods full river yields T' enrich the thirsty fields. The setled furrowes, soft with showres, Take in Thy blessings stores. Thou do'st the year with goodnes crowne Thy clouds drop fatnesse downe. The barren deserts shall abound; The hills with joy resound; The flocks be full, the pastures spring, With corne the vallies sing. Psal. LXVI. Make unto God a joyfull noyse; Ye lands lift up your voyce. Sing forth the honour of His Name, Report His glorious fame. Say unto God, how wond'rous are The works Thou dost prepare! To Thee, who in great pow'r do'st sit, Shall all Thy foes submit. With Songs, and adoration shall The earth before Thee fall. Come see His awfull works, and might, Shew'n in His children's fight. He turn'd the Sea into dry land, Wher-on their foot did stand. He rules in pow'r; His eye doth quell The Nations that rebell. O blesse our God, so justly fear'd; And cause His praise be heard: Who makes our soule in life abide, Nor lets our feet to slide. Thou us O God hast prou'd, &amp; try'd, Like silver purify'd: Thou broughtest us into the snare; Our loines afflicted are. Thou wicked men hast suffered To trample on our head; We went through fire, and water past; Yet sav'dst Thou us at last. I will into thy Temple bring A thankfull Offering. The vow, my lips in trouble made, Devoutly shall be paid. I offer will burnt sacrifice, Whilst clouds of Incense rise: Rams, Goats, with Bullocks from the stall Shall at Thy Altar fall. O come, and heare my words declare How large Gods favours are; When with my mouth on Him I call'd, And with my tongue extoll'd. If wickednesse my heart regard, I shall not then be heard. But God enclined hath his eare, My prayers voice to heare. Let God for evermore be blest, Who granted my request: Who hath not turn'd away His face, Nor held from me His grace. Psal. LXVII. Thy mercy (Lord!) extend, And blessings on us send; O let Thy Light and Face Divine, Upon Thy servants shine. That through the earth Thy way Be know'n to Gentiles may; And nations of the Universe Thy saving health rehearse. Let all the people raise Their voyce to sing Thy praise. O God! let them with joy expresse To Thee their thankfulnesse. O let the Nations sing With gladnesse to their King: For thou the world shalt judge with right, And rule the earth with might. Let all the people raise Their voice to sing Thy praise; O God, let them with joy expresse To Thee their thankfulnesse. Then shall the earth encrease In plenty, and in peace: And God, our God, in blessings shew'n, Shall us His people own. God, who doth ever live, To us shall blessings give. That all the ends of earth may feare, And duty to Him beare. Psal. LXVIII. [First Part] Let God (the God of might) arise; And scatter'd be His enemies. And let all those that hate Him, flee As smoake, by winds we driven see. So perish wicked men like fumes; Or melted wax, which fire consumes. But let the righteous rejoyce; And unto God lift up their voyce. Sing unto God, sing praises lowd To Him that rides upon the cloud. The Name of great Iehovah blesse, A father of the fatherlesse; For he relieves the widowes wants; He solitary housholds plants: And frees the Captives from their chains Whil'st rebels are with hunger slaine. When (Lord) Thy people Thou didst lead And marches through the desart tread, The Heavens melted, the earth shook, And Sinai was with terrour strook. Yet Thou upon thy Lot didst powre, When faint and weary, plenties store: Thy congregation Thou didst feed; Reliev'dst the poore, and help'dst their need. The Lord Himselfe did give the word, And num'rous preachers it record. Kings armies fled, and took the foyle, Whilst women did divide the spoile. Though then ye have neglected ly'n, Ye shall againe with lustre shine; Like to the doves faire plumed wing, As Gold, or Silver glistering. When God great Kings had put to flight, The land was like to Salmon white. God's Mount is as faire Bashans hill, Whose height does earth with wonder fill. Why leap ye hills which so excell? This is the hill where God will dwell: His Chariots twenty thousand are; Thousands of Angels serve His war. Second Part. Thou ha'st ascended up on high, And captive led captivity: Did'st ransome those who did rebell; That God might still among them dwell. Blest be the Lord, the God of health, Who loads us daily with His wealth. He is the God, whose saving breath The issues doth command from death. But God shall wound their hatefull head Who wilfully in sins are led. He said, I will my people keep, From Bashan bring, &amp; through the deep. That so Thy foot (borne through the cries Of fall'n, and dying enemies,) May dipped be in slaughters flood; And tongues of dogs lick up their blood. How Thou, (my God &amp; King,) we know Didst in Thy Sanctuary go: Singers lead to the Instrument, Then Damsels with their Timbrels went, Blesse God all yee from Iacob spring: Small Benjamin their Ruler bring. With Princely Iudah on the Throne, Strong Nepthali, and Zebulon. Thy God for thee did strength command O let Thy work confirmed stand. Then presents shall by Kings to Thee In Salems Temple offer'd be. Rebuke the peoples brutish spight; Those scatter, who in war delight. So Egypts Princes, and the Moore, With hands stretch'd out shall thee adore. Earth's Kingdomes sing, and praise ascribe To God, who 'bove the Heavens doth ride His mighty voyce He out doth send: His strength excells, the clouds to rend. O God, Thou from thy Holy Place With terrour dost thy foes amaze. He strength and pow'r to Israel gives: Blessed be God, who ever lives. Psal. LXIX. [First Part] Save me O God, for on my soule The furious waters rowle: Sunk deep in mire, no stay I have, Orewhelm'd by ev'ry wave. I weary am of my long cry; My throat is hoarse, and dry. My failing eyes their strength abate, Whilst for my God I wait. My haters without cause exceed The haires upon my head: And though I things not took restore, They wrong, and hate me more. God! my folly Thou ha'st know'n; My sins to Thee are show'n. Let none that seek, or wait for Thee, Through me confounded be. For Thy sake have I borne disgrace, Shame cover'd hath my face: A stranger to my brethren am, Who from my Mother came. I in Thy Houses zeale do pine, Thy wrongs reputing mine. Yet when I fasted, wept, and mourn'd, That my reproach was turn'd. For garments I have Sack-cloath worne; A Proverb grow'n of scorne: Revil'd by those the gate that throng, And made the drunkards song. But (Lord) to Thee my prayers climbe In Thy accepted time: O for Thy Truth, and mercies sake, Heare those requests I make. Deliver me from out the mire, Where envious floods conspire; To swallowing deeps me nere expose, Nor let the pit enclose. Give eare (O Lord) as Thou art kind, Let me Thy mercy find: Hide not Thy Face in time of need; But heare my moane with speed. Second Part. Draw nigh (O Lord,) my soule redeem, Lost in my foes esteem. Thou my dishonour know'st, and shame, And those who me defame. Reproach my heavy heart hath broke, Press'd downe with sorrowes stroake. For pitty I, and comfort look, But friends have me forsook. For drink, they Vineger, for meat, They gave me Gall to eat: O let their table prove their snare, Their peace turne to despaire. Their eyes be dark'ned; and still make Their loines through terrour shake. Upon their heads Thy fury powre; Let vengeance them devoure. Make desolate their dwelling place; Their habitation rase. For they, whom Thou hast smote, pursue; The woundeds griefe renew. Add sin to their iniquity; Let them thy presence fly: Blot from the Book of life their soule, Nor with thy Saints enroll. But I am poore, and full of paine; O raise me up againe: So in my Song Ile praise thy Name, And thankfull ditties frame. Such gifts, and sacrifice, as these, Will God much better please, Then fatted Oxen from the stall, Which on His Altar fall. The meek shall see this, and be glad, whose hopes on God are stay'd. For he will hear the poor mans cryes, His pris'ners not despise. Let Heaven praise Him, Seas, and earth, With all in them have birth. For God will Sions Cities blesse, For Iudah to possesse. His servants, and succeeding race Inherit shall this place. And those, that love His glorious Name, For ever there remaine. Psal. LXX. Make hast O God my life to save, Thy speedy help I crave. Their practises with shame confound, That seek my soule to wound. Let them disgraced all retire, That do my hurt desire: Who 'gainst me say, Aba, in scorne, To shamefull ruin turn. And let all those that seek to Thee, Rejoyce and gladded be. Let them, who in thy love confide, Say, God be magnify'd. But I am poor, and prest with need; O God, to me make speed: Thou art my help, and only stay; O Lord, make no delay. Psal. LXXI. Sing this as the Lamentation. In thee (O Lord) my trust I place; Confound me never with disgrace: Thou in Thy justice set me free, Incline Thine eare, and succour me. Be Thou my strong and safe resort, Who art my Rock, and only Fort. O Save me from unrighteous bands, From cruell men, and bloody hands. Thou art my hope, O God of truth; My trust and Comfort from my youth: Thou from the womb did'st me sustaine, When brought forth in my Mothers paine, Thou from her bowels did'st me bring, Of Thee my praise shall ever sing: And though mens wonder I am made My strong defense on Thee is lay'd. O let my mouth be fill'd with praise, And with Thy honour all my daies: Cast me not off, when old and fraile; Nor me forsake when strength doth faile. Mine enemies combine with hate, And for my Soule lay daily wait: Saying, Him persecute and take, For God and man doth him forsake. O be not far from me at need; My God, to succour me make speed: Consume all those, and them confound, Who seek my Soule with hate to wound. Reproach them who conspire my hurt, And my affliction make their Sport. So never shall my hope give ore; But I will praise Thee more and more. My mouth shall still Thy mercies shew, Whose number I could never know. And in Thy strength will I go on, Thy goodnesse only mention. O God, thou me from youth hast taught, To speak the wonders thou hast wrought Forsake me not, when gray, and old; Till to this Age Thy pow'r is told. Thy righteousnesse, O God, exceeds: Who equall can Thy mighty deeds? Thou who hast shew'd me grief, &amp; paine, Shalt quicken me (O Lord) againe: Thy hand shall bring me from the deep, Though bury'd low in earth I sleep: Thou shalt my greatnes then encrease, And comfort me with endlesse peace. Therefore (O God) through all my daies On Psalteries Thy truth I'le praise: And on the harpe Thy mercies tell, O Holy one of Israël! My joyfull lips to thee shall sing; My soul, which Thou from death didst bring My tongue Thy justice shall proclaime; Who do'st my foes confound with shame. Psal. LXXII. As Psalme 51. Give (Lord) thy judgments to the King, And from his Son let Justice spring. So shall the right to all extend, And equity the poor defend. The mountains then shall bring forth peace The hils by righteousnesse encrease. He shall the poor and needy save, But break oppressors in the grave. All generations shall Thee feare, So long as Sun, and Moon appeare. He shall, like raine on grasse new mow'n, Or showres that water earth, come downe. The just shall flourish in His daies; And Peace abound, whilst light displayes. From Sea to Sea His Throne shall reach, And from the flood to earths end stretch. They, who in desarts dwell, shall bow; His foes, as dust His feet below. Tarshish, the Isles, with Sheba's King, And Seba shall their presents bring. All Kings before Him shall fall downe, And every Nation serve His crowne. The cries of helples He will heed, And save the soules of such as need. He shall from violence redeem, And pretious their blood esteem. Sheba shall Gold for Tribute pay; Men praise Him still, and for Him pray. The smallest handfull then of corne, Upon the tops of Mountaines borne, Like Lebanon full fruits shall powre; The people flourish like the flow'r. His Name endureth, whil'st the Sun About the world his course doth run. Blessings through Him descend on all; And Nations shall Him Blessed call. Blessed be God, whose every act His Servants wonder doth attract. Blest be His Name: Let Earth, and men Be with His glory fill'd: Amen. Psal. LXXIII. Sing this as Psalme 119. [First Part] God unto Israel is kind; To those are cleane in mind. Yet had my wav'ring feet, and faith Almost forsook their path. For I to envy could not cease At fools, and sinners peace: Who not impaire in ages length, Nor lessen'd are in strength. They not like others troubled are, Nor plagu'd with common care. They therefore are with proud disdaine Compass'd, as with a chaine: And as a garment for defence, Cover'd with violence. Their wanton eye with fatnesse swells; And wealth their wish excells. They most corrupt oppresse the weak, And arrogantly speak. They set their mouth 'gainst heaven to talk, Their tongue through earth doth walk. Therefore Gods people, when they see, How prosp'rous sinners be: And vexed with their sorrowes sense, Incline to their defense. So words like these their passion throwes; How should we thinke, God knowes; Who lets the wicked live in health, And daily grow in wealth? Why vertue then should I retaine? I cleanse my heart in vaine. In vaine my hands held from offense I wash in innocence. For all the daies my life hath seen, I have afflicted been; My Soule, with wants and sorrowes worne, Was chast'ned every morne. Yet, should I not these murmurs check, But thus disturbed speak; I might thy Children so offend, And Thee blaspheming end. Second Part. But this I found by flesh and blood Hard to be understood: Nor, till I to Thy Temple went, Could know, what these things meant. Then I discern'd, what they portend, And how the wicked end: Whom Thou in slippery fortunes plac't Do'st unto ruin cast. How are their glories, quick as thought, To desolation brought? They in a moment turn'd to teares Consume by their own feares. God, as a dreame when one awakes, Their Image vanish makes. Causing their late admirers eyes Them now as much despise. Thus was my heart perplex'd with paines And anguish prick'd my reines; So foolish in my thoughts disrest Am I, so like a beast. Yet I by Thee am still sustain'd, Held up by Thy Right hand. Thy counsail here shall me direct, Then crown with Thine Elect. Whom have I in the heav'ns, but Thee? Who can my Saviour be? And through the spatious earth I none Desire, but Thee alone. My drooping heart doth daily faile, My flesh corrupt and fraile: But Thou the strength'ner of my heart, And lasting portion art. Who far from Thee revolting fly, Shall perish utterly. For Thou destroy'st, and castest low Such as to Idols bow. But it is good, with holy feare That I to God draw neare: To Thee my hopes entrusted are, Who will Thy works declare. Psal. LXXIV. Sing this as the Lamentation. Why art Thou absent (Lord) so long, Regardlesse of Thy Servants wrong? Or wherefore doth Thy kindled ire, Thy sheep and Pastures burne like fire? O think upon Thy chosen Lot, Nor let Mount Sion be forgot. And may the tribe thou did'st redeeme, Be ever deare in Thy esteeme. Lift up Thy feet, bring those to nought, Tho' gainst Thy Church have evill wrought: Thine adversaries roar and shout, They hang in scorne their banners out. The carved workes, whose art and cost Thy Temples building once did boast, Are into pitty'd ruin throw'n, And with their hammers broken down. Thy Holy Place they turne to flame, Defile the dwelling of Thy Name: And in their wicked hearts designe, His glories quite to undermine. With generall havock let us rase, The Sanctuaries hallow'd place. Gods Houses thus in ashes lay'd, Are wofull heaps of rubbish made. We see no Signe, nor Miracle, No Prophet have, who can foretell: Not one hath knowledge to forecast, How long these miseries shall last. O God! still shall the foe blaspheme, And make Thy Name dishonours them Thy vengefull hand no longer hide, But stretch it forth to strike their pride. For God is my all pow'rfull King, From whom earths help &amp; safety spring, Thou did'st restraine the rising tide, And with Thy strength the Sea divide. Thou brak'st th' Ægyptian Dragons head, And left'st him on the waters dead; Leviathan that sports the flood, Thou gavest for Thy peoples food. Thou from the rock mad'st fountaines flow, And swelling Seas dry land to grow: Thine is the day, the Suns faire light, Thine are the courses of the night: The borders which the earth confine, Are set and bounded by Thy line; The Summers heat, and winters cold, From Thee their yearly seasons hold. Remember, Lord! Thy House defil'd, Thy Name by blasphemies revil'd: O give not up Thy Turtles life, A spoile to adversaries strife: Let not Thy Congregation mourne, Reproach'd by Them, of Thee forlorne: Look on the Covenant, and see Earth dark'ned by their crueltie. Let not th' opprest returne with shame, But let the needy praise Thy Name. Arise (O God!) maintaine Thy cause, Thy Temples honour, and Thy Lawes. Remember their blaspheming noise, Thine enemies insulting voice. Their insolence, who Thee despise, Doth still encrease and higher rise. Psal. LXXV. To Thee (O God) with gratefull heart, To Thee we thanks impart. How neare, and helpfull is Thy Name, Thy wond'rous works proclaime. When I, advanc'd to Judah's throne, Shall rule the Nation; In justice will I take delight, And judge the peoples right. The earth, with hir inhabitants, Through feare dissolves and faints. Yet of hir loose, declining frame The Pillars I sustain. I said unto the foolish men; Deale not so madly then: And unto those, Gods precepts scorne, Exalt not you the horne. Lift not your selves against His check, Nor speak with a stiffe neck. Promotion comes not from the east, Nor South, nor from the West. But God as Judge our fortune guides, Our lot of life divides: He one man lifts unto the Crowne, And puts another downe. He holds a cup, whose wine is red, Full mixt, and tempered: For wicked ones the dreg, and lee, Wrung out to drink shall be. I will in Songs of praise declare, The God of Iacobs care; The hornes of Pride cut off will I, But lift the Just on high. Psal. LXXVI. Sing this as the Prayer after the Commandements. In Iudah God is know'n; His Name The Israelites for Great proclaime. His Tabernacles Salem grace, And Sion is His dwelling place. There He the Bow and arrowes broke, And Battailes to confusion shooke. The glittering sword, the guarding shield, Could not resist, nor safety yield. Thou of more honour art then they, Who rove upon the Hills of prey: For They, whose pride did us embroile, Are now themselves become a spoile. A lasting sleep shuts up their eyes, And all their strength in weaknes dyes: At Thy rebuke the barbed horse, And armed Chariots loose their force. Thou Lord art fear'd; who may withstand The fury of Thy pow'rfull hand? From Heaven we Thy Judgments heard, The trembling earth was still, and fear'd. When God the meek and humble saves, But gives the proud untimely graves, He on their fall his fame doth raise, And turnes their malice to His praise. Vow to the Lord your God, and bring To Him your promis'd offering: He Princes spirits can restraine, And Kings of earth with terrour chaine. Psal. LXXVII. Sing this as the Lamentation. I cry'd to God with accents shrill; To God that heares my prayer still. When into times of trouble brought, I unto Him for succour sought. All night my anguish did not cease; My soule no comfort found, nor ease. I think on God amidst my paines, My vexed spirit to Him complaines. My sleeples eyes Thou hold'st awake; My tongue perplexed nothing spake. The daies of old I meditate, The antient times expired date. I to remembrance call my Song, My wonted mirth, omitted long: All night I commune with my heart, My spirits search to ease my smart. Will God for ever us reject? Or by His favour us protect? His compassion lost and gone; His promises not thought upon? Hath God His pitty now forgot? Or must destruction be our lot? Or will His wrath, by sin renew'd, His tender mercies quite exclude? Thus I complain'd: And then said I, This is mine own infirmity. But I remember will the yeares Thy right hand kept from want, or feare The wonders which Thou did'st of old Shall with my thankfull tongue be told. My heart Thy works Shall meditate, My words Thy noble acts relate. Thy wayes (O God!) most holy are; Who with Thy greatnes may compare In miracles, and wond'rous signes Thy strength among the People shines. Thou with that high victorious hand Not all the Nations could withstand, The Sons of Iacob did'st redeeme; And Iosephs off-spring wilt esteeme. O God the waters at Thy sight Unto their depths retir'd with fright: The billowes of the troubled maine Shrunk downe, and hid themselves againe The melting cloud discharg'd in showres Like to a falling tempest powres: Whilst sounds of horrour teare the sky, And through the aire thine arrowes fly. Loud thunder from the heavens strook, Thy lightnings shone, earths fabrick shook: In the great waters lyes Thy path, Which where Thou go'st no footsteps hath. Thy people Thou like sheep ha'st led, Sav'd from the Sea, in deserts fed: And brought'st them to their promis'd land, By Moses and by Aarons hand. Psal. LXXVIII. Sing this as Psalme 51. [First Part] Heare, O my people, and encline Your eare unto my Lawes divine. I will dark Parables unfold, Which we have heard from fathers told. We will not from succession hide His works in praises magnifi'd: Who gave a Law to Israel, Which Parents must to Children tell. That generations yet unborne Might know their duty to performe? That they their hope in God may set; And not His workes, or Law forget: Nor like their fathers, rebells prove, With hearts unstedfast in His love: Like those revolters Ephraim bred, Who armed from the battell fled. They Gods command, and Pact refus'd; His works forgate, and pow'r abus'd: When Egypts land, and Zoans field Such marvailes to their fight did yield. For then divided He the deep, The floods contracting to an heap: By day the Cloud their guide became; At night He led them with a Flame. He Rocks in barren desarts clave, Which drink like swelling rivers gave: He caus'd full streams from drought to grow And waters made like torrents flow Yet they, by sinning, Him forsook, And in the desart did provoke. They tempted God by asking meat; Which they for lust, not hunger, eat. Yea thus against their God they spake: Can He in desarts diet make? The Rock He did in streames divide; But can He bread, or flesh provide? When God heard this, His just mov'd ire 'Gainst Iacob kindled like a fire: Because their God they faithles griev'd, And His salvation not believ'd. Though his command the clouds had try'd The doores of heaven open'd wide: He rain'd downe Manna for their meat, And gave them corne from heav'n to eat. Thus man with Angels food was fed: For to the full He gave them bread. He caus'd the Eastern wind to blow, And made the South His plenty throw. He flesh, as dust, upon them rain'd; The fowles like heaps of Sand remain'd. They 'midst their Camp with food were cloy'd, And all they could desire, enjoy'd But whil'st Their mouth the meat in took, God's wrath their best, &amp; choicest strook. For all this, Israel sinned still, His wonders slight, neglect His will. Second Part. Therefore their daies they vainely spend, And all their yeares in trouble end. Yet when He slew them, then they sought, And God to their remembrance brought: They turn'd, and from their sin retir'd, And early after God enquir'd. Then God They for their Rock esteem'd Remembring He had them redeem'd. Yet with their flatt'ring mouth they ly'd Their heart His Covenant deny'd: Though full of pitty He forgave, Restrain'd His wrath, and Them did save, For He remembred, They were fraile, Whose lusts above His Laws prevaile: As passing winds, so light and vaine, Which breathing out, nere come again. Oft did they grieve Him, oft rebell; Tempting the God of Israel. They thought not on His pow'rfull arm Which kept them safe from hostile harm How He His signes in Egypt wrought, His wonders over Zoan brought: And turn'd their rivers into blood; They could not drink the crimsin flood. He sent strange flies which them annoy And frogs, their plenty to destroy: Their fruits the Caterpillars eat, And Locusts reap'd the ploughman's sweat With haile their swelling vines were lost, Their Sycamores destroy'd with frost. Their herds by tempest came to nought Their flocks the furious thunder smote. His fiercest wreath on them was spent; Bad Angels were among them sent: Their soules not spared were from death, Disease and plagues depriv'd their breath. The first borne He through Egypt slew, The chief which Ham, or Nilus knew. But He His people led like sheep, And did His flock in desarts keep. Third Part. He brought them safe, and free from fear; When their pursuers drowned were. And to His Sanctuary led, The Mount His hand had purchased. The Heathen He before them drave, Their land by line to Iacob gave; And made their tribes in tents to dwell: Who tempting God, againe rebell. They like their fathers backward slide; As bowes deceitfull, turn'd aside. High places Him provoke, and prove; His jealousie their Idols move. When God heard this, He waxed wroth, And Israel did greatly loath: His Tabernacle He forsook, And no delight in Shiloh took. Their strength He gave to captive bands; His Glory to the Heathens hands: He left His people to the sword; His kindled wrath His Lot devour'd. Their young men were consum'd by fire; Their maids in marriage none require; Their Priests were unto slaughter sent; Nor did their widowes them lament. Then did the Lord from sleep awake, From wine as Giants spirit take: Upon His flying foes He came, And put them to perpetuall shame. He Ioseph's Tent did then refuse, Nor would the Tribe of Ephraim chuse. But Iudahs Tribe He did elect, Mount Sion, which His thoughts affect. His Sanctuary high He plac't, Like earth, which stands for ever fast. His choyce did then on David looke, And from amongst the Sheepfolds took. From following Ewes, he made him feed His chosen People, Iacob's seed: Whom with a perfect heart he fed, And by his skilfull conduct led. Psal. LXXIX. Sing this as the Lamentation. O God the Heathen us invade, Thine heritage a prey is made. Thy Holy Temple they defile, And Salem make their ruins pile. The bodies of thy servants ly, To gorge the fowles through heav'n that fly, The carkasses of Saints are feasts, To glut and feed devouring beasts: Their bloud like water hath been shed, And none would see them buryed. We are become our neighbours flowt, Reproach'd and laugh'd at round about: How long Lord shall thy jealous ire, Consume us like unquenched fire? Let thy fierce anger those devoure, Who neither feare thy Name, or pow'r. Let those at length thy judgments tast, Whose furious rage lay'd Iacob wast. Remember not our former sin, Nor how rebellious we have bin: Let speedy mercies us prevent, Who languish through thy punishment: Save us O God, for thy great Name, Forgive our sins, remove our shame. Why should in scorne the Heathen say, Where is the God whom we obay? O let the value of our blood, In thy revenge be understood! And let the pris'ners groanes, and sighes, Up to thy throne of mercy rise! Deliver those are mark't to dy, By their blood-thirsting cruelty. Let seven-fold vengeance them reward, Who nor thy Church, nor thee regard: And may those tongues which thee blasphemy Become themselvs reproaches theme. So we thy People, and the sheep, Which thine own Fold &amp; Pastures keep Wil thank thy goodnes all our daies, And to succession sing thy praise. Psal. LXXX. Great Shepheard who dost Israel keep, And leadest Ioseph like a sheep; Give eare, and shine with glorious light, O thou that dwell'st 'twixt Cherubs bright. Before thy Tribes, now Captives made, Stir up thy selfe and bring us aid: Manasses, Ephraim behold, And Benjamin to bondage sold. Turne us againe O God of might, And shew to us thy comforts light; Thy favour to thy servants deigne, And then we shall be whole againe. How long wilt thou displeased be, With those who daily worship thee? How long thy closed eare exclude Their Prayers, who to Thee have sa'd? Thou feedest Them with sorrowes bread, And teares for drink are measured; We are through strife and envy torne, Our neighbours spoile, our haters scorne. Turne us againe great God of might, And shew to us thy comforts light; Thy favour to Thy servants deigne, And then we shall be whole againe. Thou didst a Vine from Ægypt bring, Thy hand which planted, made it spring; And that it might have room to spred, The Heathen were discomfited: I'ts root Thou caused'st fast to stand, And with faire branches fill the land; The Hills were cover'd with Hir shade, Hir boughes like goodly Cedars made. Hir Armes did from the River reach, Unto the Swelling Oceans beach. Why ha'st Thou then broke downe hir fense Exposing hir to violence? That all who passe along hir place, Pluck off hir grapes, hir stock deface; The Mountaine beasts, the Forrest Boare, Root up hir plants, devoure hir store. Returne O God! from heaven shine, Visit Thy now despised Vine: And what thy right hand once did plant, O never may thy blessing want. Let all hir branches flourish long, Which for thy self thou mad'st so strong For though cut down, and burnt she lye Thy beames of love shall make hir rise. Thy people strengthen and protect, Whom for thy self Thou did'st elect: So will we not goe back from Thee, Whose name shall still invoked be. Turne us again O God of might, And shew to us Thy comforts light; Thy favour to thy servants deigne; And then we shall be whole againe. Psal. LXXXI. To God our strength lift up your voyce, And make a joyfull noyse. Let Timbrell, Psalme, the pleasant Lyre With Psaltery conspire. The Trumpet in the New Moone blow, In solemne triumph goe: Which God did as a Law ordaine For Iacob to retaine. This He to Ioseph did command In the Egyptian land; Where I a language hear'd unknow'n, And understood by none. His shoulder I from burthens eas'd, From making bricks releas'd. Thou didst on me in trouble call, Who ransom'd thee from thrall. In thunder from the breaking cloud I answer'd thee alowd; And at the waters where you strove In Meribah did prove. Heare O my people! I will tell To Thee O Israel: No Heathen Gods shalt Thou adore, Nor worship them before. I am thy God, who freedome wrought, And Thee from Egypt brought. Thy mouth enlarg'd, and open'd wide, By me shall be supply'd. But they my precepts did neglect, And Iacob Me reject: So left I them to lusts unknow'n, And counsells of their own. O that my people would have hear'd, And from my wayes not errd. Their foes then had I soon subdu'd, And with my hand pursu'd. No place God's haters should secure; But they should still endure. I fed them had with finest wheat, And hony, for their meat. Psal. LXXXII. Sing this as the Prayer after the Commandements. God in the great assembly sits; To Kings and Judges judgment fits. How long the right will ye reject, And persons of the bad respect? The poor and fatherlesse defend, Justice to men opprest extend: Deliver those in need that stand, And save them from the wicked's hand. They will not understand, nor know; But in the mists of darknes go. Earths bases all are out of course, Whil'st justice failes, and Law wants force. I said, that Kings are Gods on earth, And sons deriv'd from highest birth. But ye like other men shall dy, And with the fallen Princes ly. O God! whose pow'r doth all comprise, In judgment on the earth arise. For all the nations scatter'd far, Thy lot, and Tributaries are. Psal. LXXXIII. Do not (O God) Thou silence keep, Nor let Thy vengeance sleep; Thy hatefull foes lift up their head, In tumults gathered. With craft, and counsailes of deceit, They plot, and ly in wait; How they Thy People may annoy, And Thine elect destroy. Come let us (say this furious rout,) Their Nation quite root out; And let the name of Israel be Lost to all memory. In consultations full of hate, 'Gainst Thee confederate, Edom with Ishmael combine, Moab with Hagars line. Gebal, and Ammon 'gainst us fight, With the Amalekite: The Philistines arm'd bands conspire, With those that dwell at Tyre: And Ashur runs in to their aid, Prepared to invade; They strengthen Lots incestuous race, Our dwellings to deface. But Thou like Midian them confound, Whose sword themselvs did wound: Like Sisera O make them all, Who did at Kishon fall. Be they as Iabin swoll'n with pride, Whose dreadfull Armies dy'd: Their carkasses in Endor flung, Were spread on earth as dung. Let Oreb's, Zeb's, Zalmunna's fate, Reward their Princes hate, Who said, let us our force address, Gods Houses to possess. My God! O make them like a wheele, As straw in winds to reele; As raging fires their fuell burn, And Hills to ashes turn; So with Thy tempest them pursue, With stormes their fear renew. O Lord! their faces fill with shame, That they may seek Thy Name. Let them confounded ever stand, And perish by Thy hand; That men may know, Iehovahs Name Rules all this earthly frame. Psal. LXXXIV. How lovely, Thou great Lord of war, Thy Tabernacles are! My longing soule is faint, and pain'd, Whilst from thy Courts restrain'd. My heart, my flesh, with all that give Me pow'r to move, or live, Cry loud, till they admitted be The living God to see. Yea Sparrows find a house to rest; The Swallow builds hir nest: Their young they to thine Altar bring, O Lord, my God and King. Blessed are they, who all their daies Thee in thy Temple praise. Blest is the man, whose strength Thou art; Whose wayes direct his heart. Who passing through the mournfull vale, Where springs and comforts faile, Make wells in Baca's barren plaine, And pooles to fill with raine. They go from strength to strength, nor faint Through wearinesse or want; Till to thy House approaching neare In Sion they appeare. Lord God of Hosts, my prayer heare; O Iacob's God give eare! O God our Shield, looke downe with grace On Thine Annointed's face. One day, which in Thy Courts He spends, Thousands of ours transcends. Id rather keep a door with thee, Then all earth's glory see. For God our shield, our Sun, and light, Crownes those that walk upright. Nor failes all good such men to give, Who in His Statutes live. O Lord of Hosts, great God of Might, Who dwell'st in endlesse light: How blessed shall that servant be, Who puts his trust in Thee? Psal. LXXXV. Lord! to thy land Thou good hast been Which hath Thy favour seen: Thou Iacob's Off-spring hast set free From thtir captivitie. Thou thy forgivenes didst dispense, To cover all offence. Thou hast remov'd Thy wrath which burn'd And from thy fiercenes turn'd. Turne us O God of health, and peace, O cause Thine anger cease. Wilt Thou displeas'd for ever be With all posterity? Wilt Thou not us againe receive? Thy peoples joyes enlive? Lord shew That mercy which we want, And Thy salvation grant. I will what God declares attend, For He His peace will send, And cures His Saints of all their paine, If they not sin againe. For His salvation is near, To such as do Him fear: That glory in our land may dwell, And all things prosper well. Mercy with Truth united is; Justice and Peace do kisse. Truth springing out of earth is strook, And Right from Heav'n doth look. The Lord shall give us all things good; Our land yield store of food. Before Him Righteousnes shall go, His wayes and steps to shew. Psal. LXXXVI. Bow down thine eare (Lord) to my cry, Poor, and in misery: Preserve my guiltles soul, whose faith On thee depended hath. Shew mercy (Lord!) for, all the day, Before thy throne I pray: Rejoyce thy servants soul, which he Lifts up (O Lord) to thee. Thou good and gratious do'st live, And ready to forgive: Thou plenteous mercy keep'st in store, For all who Thee implore. Unto my prayer (Lord) give eare, My supplications heare: In time of trouble, and of greife, Thou sendest me releife. Among earths Gods, or Pow'rs Divine, No works are like to thine. The Nations all, whom Thou didst frame, Shall glorifie Thy Name. Thou wonders do'st (Great God) alone; Thy way to me make know'n. My heart unto thy feare unite, Who in thy name delight. Then I my faculties will raise, To honour Thee with praise; Who do'st my soul in mercy save From the devouring grave. O God! the proud against me rise, In furious companies: Ungodly men my life have sought, Who set thy pow'r at nought. But Thou, a God compassionate, Whose mercies not abate, Long suff'ring art, and patient, To pardon sinners bent. O turne to me in love againe; Let me thy pity gaine. Give strength, and from destruction O save Thine hand-maids son. Some token of thy favour deigne, Which may my haters shame. Because Thou Lord ha'st brought me aid, And art my comfort made. Psal. LXXXVII. Upon the Holy Mountaines brest, Where God Himself doth rest, His protection firmely stay'd Are Her foundations lay'd. The Lord, who Sion did elect, Hir gates doth more affect, Then all the num'rous tents beside Where Jacob's sons abide. Ierusalem! thou City faire, God's dwelling, and His care! Of thee, thou throne of Iudahs Kings, Are spoken glorious things. I wil strong Rahab mention, With high-towr'd Babylon: The scorched Ethiopian lands, The plaines where Tyrus stands; Philistia too shall reck'ned be, With those acknowledg me: For ev'ry quarter of the earth Gives Sions children birth. God shall establish Hir on high, Hir numbers multiply: When Nations far dispersed shall Be gather'd at His call. And when the Lord His Churches fruits With all Hir Sons computes, They shall amongst His people know'n Be counted for his own. The Singers too rehearsed are, Who there His praise declare; From whence arise fresh springs of Grace, To water ev'ry place. Psal. LXXXVIII. Sing this as the Lamentation. To Thee (O Lord) who me do'st save, Both day and night I cryed have. Lend to my voice a gratious eare; Whose troubled foul to death draws neare. Cast down to earth, I 'mongst the dead Am only free, and numbered. Like those who in the grave forgot, By thee cut off, corrupt and rot. Thou in the lowest pit ha'st layd, And darkest deeps my cov'ring made: I am hard pressed by Thy wrath, And every wave afflicted hath: Thou mine acquaintance hast remov'd, And sever'd me from those I lov'd: Their friendship turned is to hate; My life shut up, and desolate. My weeping eye doth daily mourne, My hands stretch'd out, my hopes forlorne. Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead, To praise Thee rais'd, and wakened? Shall the devouring grave declare, How true thy promis'd mercies are? Or shall the dark Thy wonders see, The land where all forgotten be? To Thee (O Lord) my cryes are sent: My prayer shall the morne prevent: O why do'st Thou my soul reject, And hid'st from me Thy blest aspect? Afflicted, and in misery, I almost ready am to dy; From youth to age, in lifes each act, Thy suffer'd terrours me distract? Thy wrath quite over me doth go, Thine indignation strikes me so: They, like the raging floods abound, Or swelling waters, me surround. My friends, and all my lovers are By Thee, from my reliefe put far. And those who my acquaintance we Conceal'd, or lost, my sight forbear. Psal. LXXXIX. Sing this as Psalme 51. [First Part] My Song thy mercies shall make know Thy truth to all succession. For They built up for ever last: And are in Heav'n establish'd fast: I to my chosen David sware, And did by Covenant declare; I stablish will thy seed alone, And build to Thee a lasting Throne. The Heav'ns Thy wonders praise confesse, And Saints proclaime thy faithfulnesse. For who in earth, or heaven are, Whose might can with the Lord compare? Fear'd by His Saints, by them implor'd, And by His servants still ador'd. O Lord of Hosts, who is so strong? Whose word, like thine, endures so long? Thou rul'st the Seas that rage and rise, Whose swelling wave becalmed lies: Thou Rahah brak'st, like one that's dead; Thine arme thy foes hath scattered. The Heav'ns are Thine, with earth's encrease, And all the fulnesse growes from these. The North &amp; South thy pow'r did frame, Tabor and Hermon praise thy Name. Thy mighty arme is lifted high; Thy right hand full of Majesty. Thy Throne hath justice for its base, Mercy and Truth before Thy face. Blessed are they, who at Thy Feasts, And in Thy presence, are the guests. They all the day rejoyce in Thee, In righteousnes exalted be. Thy strength and glory them adorne, Whose favour shall lift up our horne. The Lord to us doth safety bring; Thy Holy one remaines our King. In visions Thou to Him hast said: I on my chosen help have lay'd. I have my servant David found, With Oyle annointed Him, &amp; crown'd. Confirm'd, and strength'ned by my arm I will protect his life from harme. No enemy on Him exact, Nor hurt him shall, by wicked pact: His foes beat down before him fly, And shall by plagues consumed dy. My mercy yet, to him assur'd, Shall in his glory be secur'd. Second Part. His right hand, lifted ore the maine, Shall to the in-land rivers reigne. He, crying in his prayers, shall, My God, and Rock, and Father, call: I'le make him heire, my first begot; Above earth's Kings advance his lot: To Him my mercy nere shall wast; My Covenant stand ever fast. His seed shall long endure, his Throne Like Heav'ns unweary'd motion. But if His Sons my Law forsake, Or my Commands and Statutes break; My rod shall punish their neglect, My hand with stripes their sin correct. Yet shall my love to him prevaile, My Covenant nor change, nor faile. To David have I sworne, that I My promise would not falsify: His seed shall governe, whil'st the sun About the world his course doth run; And like the Moon establish'd be The faithfull pledg of my decree. But thine annointed now thy wrath Cast off, and quite abhorred hath. Thou voyd hast made the Cov'nant seal'd; Profan'd his crowne, his Rule repeal'd: His Bulwarks broke, his fenses torne, Make him his neighbour's spoyle, &amp; scorne. Thou strength'ned ha'st his foes right hand, That he in battail cannot stand; His sword wants edge, His glory's gone; And to the earth cast down his throne. Thou short'ned hast his youth; His fame Obscur'd, and cover'd is with shame. Lord! wilt Thou ever from us turne? Or shall, like fire, thine anger burne? Remember yet how short my dayes; How vaine man's life, how soon decaies What mortall lives, who shall not dy And in the pit of silence ly? Where are thy mercies (Lord!) the faith Thy oath to David plighted hath? Remember (Lord) thy servants shame; How mighty people us defame: Thinke how thy foes have us abus'd, And thine Annointed's steps traduc'd. Yet shall my soul, how ere opprest, Say evermore, The Lord be blest. Psal. XC. Sing this as the Lamentation. O Lord! Thou ha'st our refuge been; All ages have thy mercies seene. Before the lofty hills were made, Or earth's unmov'd foundation lay'd: From everlasting Thou art God, And wilt out live times period: Thou turn'st to dust the Sons of men: Then say'st, Returne to life agen. A thousand yeares in thy account But to a day with us amount: Nor are extended in thy sight, Beyond the watch of one short night: Our time runs on like rapid streams; We vanish as forgotten dreams: Like grasse, or morning flowres, we spring; Then wither in the evening. When Thou displeased art, we wast, And unto nothing come at last. Thou mark'st our deeds; our sins of night Are alwayes open to thy sight; Making the breach of thy pure Lawes, Our death, and swift destructions cause. From whence we suddenly waxe old, Expiring like a tale that's told. The common Age of mortall men Exceeds not Threescore yeares and ten. And if to Fourscore they attaine, Their life is but a length'ned paine. Incessant sorrowes, and disease, Their faculties, and vigour seize. For soon cut off our dayes decay, And suddenly we flie away. But who regards Thy heauy wrath, Or of Thy feare true feeling hath? Neither Thy judgements, nor Thy love, Can us unto repentance move. Lord! so our dayes to number teach, We may the end of wisedome reach: And learne those errours to forget, Which us in Thy displeasure set. Returne (O Lord!) and now repent At our endured punishment. How long wilt Thou thy help delay, Or not remove our woes away? O satisfy our Soule with joyes, To recompense Lifes past annoyes. Afford us comfort for those yeares, We were enforc'd to spend in teares. Lord! Let Thy glorious work appeare, Thy servants from the dust to reare. That all succeeding times may know, What praises to thy Name we owe. O let thy beames of favour shine On those, who in death's shade have ly Grant that for which we prayers make And prosper all we undertake. Psal. XCI. Who so in God's protection dwell, Abide secure, and well: 'orshadow'd by th' Almighties care Both soul and body are. I therefore to the Lord will say, Thou art my hope and stay. Thou art my refuge, my strong hold, Who do'st my faith embold. He shall preserve Thee from the net, Which cunning hunters set: Protecting thee by His defense, In times of Pestilence. He over thee His wings shall spread, With safety covered: And least temptation make thee yield, His truth shall be thy shield. The gastly terrours of the night Shall not thy peace affright: Or arrowes, which by day do kill, Thy life with slaughter spill. No tainted aire, or noysome Pest Thy dwelling shall infest. No perills, which at noon destroy, Thy safety shall annoy. Though Thousands, or ten thousands dy'd, Thick falling by thy side; Thou shalt unhurt, and guarded stand From sicknesse on each hand. Thine eye the wicked shall behold Unto destruction sold: Yet them nor feares, nor dangers shake, Who God their refuge make. No evill hap shall Thee distast, Nor plague thy dwelling wast. For He his Angels shall command Thy Centinells to stand. In all thy wayes they shall thee keep, Whither thou wake, or sleep. And least a stone thy foot should hurt, Their hands shall thee support. No Basilisk, nor Adders sting Thy life in danger bring. Thou shalt upon the Lion tread, And bruise the Dragons head. Because his love is set on me, I will his guardian be: Since he acknowledg'd hath My name, I will exalt his fame. When ere he calls, I will him heare, In trouble, and in feare. I will to honour him advance; And send deliverance. With length of life, and happy daies I will his comforts raise. And when his time on earth is done, Give him salvation. Psal. XCII. Sing this as Psalme 51. It is a good and blessed thing Praise to Thy Name (most High) to sing: Thy kindnes 'fore the morning light To shew, Thy faithfulnes each night. Upon a ten-string'd instrument With Psalteries well-tun'd concent, And on the solemne sounding Lyre, Where all harmonious notes conspire. For Thou (O Lord) my heart hast made, Through all Thy hands atchieuements, glad; Who, in Thy works, which earth do fill, Rejoyce, and alwayes triumph will. O Lord! how great Thy actions are? Deep are Thy thoughts, and hidden far. The brutish doe not this attend, Nor will the fooles it apprehend. When like the Grasse, or flow'rs which spring The wicked men are flourishing, Ev'n then their quick destruction hasts. But (Lord!) Thy glory ever lasts. For lo, throw'n downe and scatter'd all Thine enemies before Thee fall. How ere, Thou wilt exalt my horne, Like to the stately Unicorne. With freshest oyle, and balme new shed, Thou wilt annoint my conqu'ring head: Mine eye shall see its just desire On those, who 'gainst my life conspire: And for those wicked enemies, Who to my safeties hazard rise, Mine eares shall heare them come to nought By Thy revenge to ruin brought. The righteous like the Palme shall grow Or Cedars on the mountaines brow. Who in Gods House emplanted be, Within His courts we prosper see. In their old age they fruit shall bring Continue fat, and flourishing: To shew, the Lord my Rock is just, With whom no wicked harbour must. Psal. XCIII. The Lord our God doth reigne on high, Cloathed with Majesty. He vested is with glorious light, And girds Himselfe with might. The world created by His hand, Established doth stand So fast and firme upon its base, It moves not from the place. Yet far more stable, and more old, Thy Throne (O Lord) shall hold. Which, when earth's fabrick melts and wasts, Like Thee, for ever lasts. The floods (O Lord!) lift up their voice, In uproare, and in noyse, The swelling waves up-lifted rise, To band against the skies. Yet is the Lord more mighty far Then those proud waters are: And stronger then the Oceans wave, Which winds enchafed have. Thy Testimonies true and sure Eternally endure. And holynes becomes (O God!) The house of Thine aboad. Psal. XCIV. O God! who just revenge dost take, Now let Thy vengeance wake. Great Judge of earth arise, from hence The proud to recompence. How long (Lord) shall their wicked host How long triumph and boast? How long shall their insulting tongue Joy in Thy servants wrong? They break Thy people (Lord) in rage, Afflict Thine heritage. They widowes slay, the poor oppress, And kill the fatherless. Yet hard'ned in presumption, they, The Lord not sees us, say; Great Iacobs God doth not regard, Nor will the sin reward. Take heed yee brutish and unwise, Who thus your crimes disguise. Yee foolish people of the land, When will yee understand? Think ye, that he who plants the eare Unable is to heare? Or shall not he, who form'd the eye, Your wickednes descry? Shall he, who Nations overthrew, Not know to punish you? To whose all-searching view is brought The vainnes of mans thought. Blessed, (O Lord) and happy he, Who chast'ned is by Thee; Whom Thou in mercy do'st correct, And in Thy Law direct. That though with crosses over-prest, He may in patience rest, Till for transgressors ruin he A pit prepared see. For God his people not rejects, Nor his own choise neglects: But judgement all their wrongs shall right, And comfort the upright. Who will with me against those rise, Who work iniquities? But, from the Lord my help was seen, My soule had silenc'd been. When I, my slipping foot, complain'd, Thy mercy me sustain'd, When thoughts my grieved soul excite, Thy comforts hir delight. Wilt Thou support the wicked's throne, Or joyne it with Thine owne? Who, under Laws, and Reason's name, Their acts of mischief frame. Whose meetings, and whose plots are bent The just to circumvent. Who sit in Counsaile, soules to kill, And guiltles blood to spill. But yet the Lord is my defense, God is my confidence; My Rock, my refuge, and my tow'r, To save me by His pow'r. He on their heads the ills shall bring Which from themselves did spring. And in their sins God's vengfull hand Shall cut them from the land. Psal. XCV. O come, and let us to the Lord, Our cheerfull Songs record: Unto our Rock lift up our voice, And make a joyfull noyse. Let us with praise sent up on high Approach His presence nigh: With Psalmes and Anthems glad expresse Our bounden thankfulnes. He is the God and King, whose hand The spatious earth hath spann'd: By Him steep hills, and seas were made; The dry land by Him lay'd. Come, let us worship and adore, Kneel downe the Lord before: For He our God is, we His care, His sheep, and people are. To day if ye His voice will heare, No hard'ned heart bring neare; Like that provoking in the day You in the desart lay. When your fore-fathers tempted me, Who did my wonders see: And forty yeares you Tribes did pass, Wherein I grieved was. I said, my people err in heart, And wilfully depart; My wayes prescrib'd they have not know'n, Nor in my precepts gone. To whom my just incensed wrath By oath protested hath, Those murmurers should nere be blest, Or enter to my rest. Psal. XCVI. Sing this as Psalme 51. or 100. A new Song to the Lord rehearse, Sing to him all the Universe. O blesse his Name, in Songs display His saving mercies every day. His glory, and his wonders tell To Nations who far distant dwell. This great Lord must be greatly prais'd, Whose feare above all Gods is rais'd. For Heathen Gods are Idols vaine: But 'tis the Lord doth heav'n sustaine. Honour, and awe are him before, His sanctuary strong in pow'r. Ye kindreds then on earth that live, Unto the Lord due honour give: Ascribe all glory to his Name, And let his Courts with off'rings flame. O worship him, your zeale express, In beauty, and in holiness. Let all the earth before him feare, And say, God doth the Scepter beare. The world shall be establish'd so, It shall not from its fast'nings go. He to the people righteously His small judgment shall apply. Let earth be glad, and heav'n rejoyce; The roaring Ocean make a noyse: Be glad ye fruits sprung from the fields, With all the trees the forrest yields: For lo, to judgment God doth come, He comes to give the earth it's doome; His just revenge the world pursu'th, To judge the people with his truth. Psal. XCVII. Let earth rejoyce that God doth reigne And Isles within the maine. Darknes and clouds waite Him upon; And Justice is His Throne. Devouring fire before Him goes, To burne His circling foes. Throughout the world His lightnings blaze Which trembling earth amaze. Hills at his presence turn'd to fume, Like melting wax consume; The Heav'ns His righteousnes proclaime And men confess His fame. Let quick perdition all confound To worship Idols bound: Who boast in Stocks, and from Him swerve Whom all the Gods must serve. Sion and Iudah both rejoyc'd, To heare Thy judgments voyc'd; With whose exalted state none dare, Or men, or Gods, compare. Who love the Lord, and do His will, See that ye hate all ill: He doth from wicked hands protect The soules of His Elect. Unto the Godly springs a light, And joy to the upright. Let righteous men their Lord then bless, And praise His Holines. Psal. XCVIII. Vnto the Lord your Songs renew, Who marvailes wrought for you. His holy arme, and His right hand The victory hath gain'd. God His salvation hath made know'n, His truth to Heathens shew'n. His mercies have remembred been, Earth His Salvation seen. Make to the Lord a joyfull noyse; Earth, in lowd Songs rejoyce: With Harps unto your Maker sing, And Psalmes tun'd to the string. With Trumpets, and the Cornets sound Let your full joyes rebound. All in your shrillest accents sing Before the Lord your King. Let roaring Seas for gladnes swell; The world with those there dwell: Floods clap their hands, the waves combine, Let Hills in praises joyne. For lo, to Judgment God doth come, To give the earth it's doome. With justice He the world will try, And men with Equity. Psal. XCIX. The Lord doth reigne: ye people all With trembling 'fore Him fall. His throne 'twixt Cherubs He doth make: Let earth be mov'd and shake. The Lord is in His Sion great, Above the world His Seat; Let all the Holines proclaime Of His most awfull Name. This King of strength true Judgment loves And equity approves, Thou do'st Thy righteous judgments fruit In Iacob execute. Exalt the Lord, and Him adore, His foot-stoole fall before. Moses, and Aaron 'mongst His Priests, On whom His service rests. And Samuel 'mongst those that came To supplicate His Name. These call'd on Him, and when they pray'd, He gratious answer made. He from the pillar of the Cloud Did speak to them aloud: Whose Testimonies they obay'd, Nor from His statutes stray'd. Thou answer'dst them, O Lord our God! With mercy us'dst Thy rod: Their sins Thy wrath did not forbear; Yet they forgiven were. The Lord our God then magnify; Exalt His praise on high: And worship at His sacred Hill; For God is holy still. Psal. C. Make to the Lord a joyfull noyse, All lands to Him lift up your voice: Serve Him with gladnes, let your tongue Approach His presence with a Song. Know He is God, by whose hand we, And not our own, created be: We are His people, and the sheep His folds enclose, His pastures keep. Enter with thanks His dwelling place, And let His Courts resound with praise: Your gratitude to Him profess; His glorious Name for ever bless. For He is good, and great His care, His mercies everlasting are; His truth eternally shall last, When Time, and all successions wast. Psal. CI. I mercy will, and Judgment sing, To Thee my Lord and King. I wisely will my steps direct In wayes of Thine elect. O when wilt Thou to me come neare? Thy presence when appear? Who in my house with perfect heart Will nere from Thee depart. No wicked thing before mine eyes Will I behold, or prize. I hate the work of them, whose pride From Thee doth turne aside. A wicked man, and froward heart Shall from my thoughts depart: Nor with the sinfull, or perverse My knowledg shall converse. I will cut off the man, whose spight His neighbour doth back-bite. With him, whose heart, or look is high, I never will comply. Upon the faithfull of the land Mine eyes shall fixed stand. Who walketh in the perfect way, Shall in my service stay. My house shall never give receit To him that works deceit: Nor shall he tarry in my sight, Who doth in lyes delight. All those in wickedness that joy I early will destroy; And from the City of the Lord Cut all whom He abhorr'd. Psal. CII. Sing this as the Lamentation. [First Part] Heare me (O Lord!) and let my cry To Thy bright throne ascend on high. Hide not Thy face in time of need, But answer my request with speed. For all my daies away consume Like to the smoak, or rising fume. My bones like fired brands became, Burnt up &amp; scorch'd in sorrowes flame. My heart like grass is withered, And I forget to eat my bread: I wast and pine in daily groanes, That scarse my flesh cleaves to my bones: Like Pelicans remov'd from sight, Or Owles in desarts shunning light: As sparrowes their lost mates bemoane, So do I watch, and sit alone. I with reproach all day am torne Of enemies against me sworne; I ashes eat instead of bread, And drink the tears my sorrows shed. Which mischeifs from thy wrath are Since thou who rais'd, hast cast me down. Thus like the dark declining shade, Or dying flow'r, I hourely fade. Yet thou (O Lord dost still endure, From times successive change secure. Thou therefore shalt in mercy rise, And Sion help, which ruin'd lies; The time is come for hir repaire, Whose stones and rubbish prized are. Thy servants pity hir neglect, And on hir dust with sighs reflect. So shall the Heathen feare Thy Name, And Kings Thy Majesty proclaime. When God shall Sions buildings reare, And in His glory shall appeare; He will regard the poor man's suit, And not despise the destitute: This shall be written for record, That after Times may praise the Lord. Second Part. The Lord from high His beams display'd And, out of Heaven, earth survay'd; The Captives fetters to unty, And Pris'ners save condemn'd to dy. That so in Sions blessed hill, And Salem which His wonders fill, They may His name, and praise declare When all the people gather'd are. He hath my strength to weaknes brought, My Short'ned dayes are come to nought So that to God I thus did pray; O take me not as yet away: Nor cast me off from this lifes stage, In prime of youth, and mid'st of age. For though My dayes be few, and fraile Thy yeares, O God, will never faile. Thou (Lord) hast earth's foundation lay'd And by Thy hand the Heav'ns were made They all shall perish, and decay, And in their time consume away. Like to a garment, when grow'n old, They shall nor use, nor motion hold. But though the world, and they must fall, Thy Being is perpetuall. Yea as a vesture worne, and chang'd, Is from it's gloss and forme estrang'd: So Shalt Thou change this massy frame; Yet still Thy selfe abide the same. And like Thy selfe from changes freed, Thou wilt prolong Thy servants seed; Whose children shall remaine with Thee, And in Thy sight establisht be. Psal. CIII. As Psalme 51. My Soul thy best devotion raise To bless the Lord, and sing His praise. O never unremembred be The benefits He powr'd on thee: Whose pardon doth all sins release, And keep thy body from disease: Who thee redeem'd, to death cast downe, And doth thy life with mercies crowne. Who with good things shall fill thy mouth; And eagle-like renew thy youth. He by right judgment hath redrest All such as are by wrong opprest. His wayes have know'n to Moses been; The Israelites His works have seen. All which His will, and nature shew, To mercy swift, to vengeance slow. He will not alwayes with us chide; Nor let His anger long abide: Nor deales according to our sin, Nor have our crimes rewarded bin. For high as Heav'n is earth above, So large, so boundless is his love; Removing all our sins as far, As East and West divided are. Yea like a Father's to his Son, To us is his compassion. He knowes our frame too weak to trust Remembring that we are but dust. The daies of man, like to the grass, Or fading flow'r, to nothing pass. Which blow'n and shaken by the wind, Leave neither place, nor print behind. His goodnes though, confirm'd, and sure To childrens children doth endure. Ev'n unto such, whose cleare intents Walk after His Commandements. The Lord in heav'n prepares His throne, And governs all the world alone. O therefore bless that pow'rfull Lord, Who made, and rules us by His word. Ye Angels that in strength excell, And never 'gainst His word rebell: Ye winged Ministers, who still Prepared are to act His will: Ye Heav'nly hosts, and creatures all, Bless Him, and at His foot-stool fall. Lastly my Soul thy Maker praise, And bless His goodness all thy daies. Psal. CIV. As Psalme 51. [First Part] My Soul the Lord for ever bless: O God! Thy greatnesse all confess; Whom Majesty and honour vest, In robes of Light eternall drest. He Heaven makes his Canopy; His chambers in the waters ly: His Chariot is the cloudy storme, And on the wings of wind is borne. He Spirits makes His Angels quire; His Ministers a flaming fire. He so did earth's foundations cast, It might remaine for ever fast: Then cloath'd it with the spatious deep, Whose wave outswells the mountaines steep. At Thy rebuke the waters fled, And hid their thunder-frighted head. They from the mountaines streaming flow, And downe into the Vallies go: Then to their liquid center hast, Where their collected floods are cast. These in the Ocean met, and joyn'd, Thou hast within a bank confin'd: Not suff'ring them to pass their bound, Least earth by their excess be drown'd. He from the hills his Christall springs Down running to the vallies brings: Which drink supply, and coolnes yield, To thirsting beasts throughout the field. By them the fowles of heaven rest, And singing in their branches nest. He waters from his clouds the Hills; The teeming earth with plenty fills. He grass for Cattle doth produce, And every Herbe for humane use: That so He may His creatures feed, And from the earth supply their need. He makes the clusters of the vine, To glad the Sons of men with wine. He oyle to cheere the face imparts, And bread, the strength'ner of their hearts. Second Part. The trees, which God for fruit decreed, Nor sap, nor moyst'ning vertue need. The lofty Cedars by His hand In Lebanon emplanted stand. Unto the birds these shelter yield, And Storks upon the fir-trees build: Wild goats the hills defend, and feed, And in the Rocks the Conies breed. He made the changing Moone appeare, To note the seasons of the yeare. The Sun from Him his strength doth get, And knows the measure of his Set. Thou mak'st the darkness of the night, When beasts creep forth that shunn'd the light. Young Lions, roaring after prey, From God their hunger must allay. When the bright Sun casts forth his ray, Down in their Dennes themselvs they lay. Man's labour, with the morne begun, Continues till the day be done. O Lord! what wonders hast thou made, In providence and wisedome layd? The earth is with Thy riches crown'd, And Seas, where creatures most abound. There go the ships, which swiftly fly, There great Leviathan doth ly, Who takes his pastime in the flood: All these do waite on Thee for food. Thy bounty is on them distill'd, Who are by Thee with goodness fill'd. But when thou hid'st Thy face, they dy And to their dust returned ly. Thy spirit all with life endues, The springing face of earth renewes. Gods glory ever shall endure, Pleas'd in His works, from change secure Upon the earth He looketh downe, Which shrinks &amp; trembles at His frowne His lightnings touch, or thunders stroak Wil make the proudest mountains smoak. To Him my Ditties, whil'st I live, Or being have, shall praises give: My Meditations will be sweet, When fixt on Him my comforts meet. Upon the earth let sinners rot, In place, and memory forgot. But thou, my soul, thy Maker bless; Let all the world His praise express. Psal. CV. [First Part] O thank the Lord, invoke His Name, His deeds to all proclaime. With Psalmes His praises celebrate, His wond'rous works relate. Glory in Him ye whose desires, And heart for God enquires, Seek ye the Lords all-pow'rfull might, His faces glorious light. The works of wonder He hath done, And Judgments think upon, Ye who from faithfull Abraham, And chosen Iacob came. He is the Lord, whose judgments show'n Through all the earth are know'n: He Cov'nant keeps in word and deed, To thousands that succeed. To Abraham, and Izaak both He promis'd with an oath; And for a Law His sacred pact To Iacob did enact: In which He vow'd, that Israel In Canaans Land should dwell; When they in number weak, and few, Nor place, nor people knew. When they much time in travailes spent Through divers Nations went; All those that wrong'd them He remov'd And Kings for them reprov'd. To whom He said (by His command That none should them withstand;) 'Gainst mine Anointed lift no arme, Nor do my Prophets harme. A famine through the land He spread, Which brake their staffe of bread. Yet He by Ioseph had decreed He would His people feed: Whose feet, when into bondage sold, They did in fetters hold; Till God ordained his release, And gave his triall ease. The King sent, from Captivitie To loose, and set him free. He made him all His house command, Cheife Ruler of the Land. Yea he such Sov'raigne pow'r resign'd, He might his Princes bind: And, tutor'd by His counsailes wise, His Senators advise. Second Part. Then Jacob into Egypt came, A Sojourner in Ham. Where his encreased people growes Much stronger then their foes: Whose heart He turn'd their name to hate, And use them with deceit: Till Moses for their succour sent, With chosen Aaron went. They most prodigious wonders shew'd, And signes in Hams aboad: Where darkness, blacker then their nights, In midst of noone affrights: The foggs, and vapours Him obey, By putting out the day. Fish in their waters turn'd to blood Were smother'd in the Flood. Now Egypt frogs abundant brings In chambers of their Kings. He spake, and swarmes of Flies arise; Their coasts are fill'd with Lice. For raine, He haile and tempest powres, And flames of fire, for showres. With storme their Vines and Fig-trees shook, Through all their land were broke. Locusts, and caterpillers bred, Not to be numbered, All herbs and fruits that could be found Devoured on the ground. Their first borne He through Egypt slew, Their cheifest strength orethrew. But brought His People forth with wealth Not one decay'd in health. Egypt was glad and quit of feare, When They departed were. Whose guide by day the cloud became, And in the night a Flame. On quailes His longing people fed, From Heav'n He gave them bread. He from the rock made waters flow, Springs in dry places grow. To Abraham His promise made He in remembrance had; He brought with joy His people thence, Secur'd by His defense. And gave Them for their lot a soyle Enrich'd by others toyle: That in His Statutes they might live. To him all praises give. Psal. CVI. Sing this as Psalme 51. [First Part] O praise and thank our gratious God, Whose mercy knowes no period. Who can His mighty acts declare? Or shew how due His praises are? They blessed are who judg aright, And alwayes in the Truth delight. Lord think on me with Thine Elect; Let Thy salvation me protect. Me to Thy Chosen's joyes aduance, The bliss of Thine inheritance. Our sins with sorrow we confess, Who, like our Fathers, still transgress. Thy works in Egypt they forgot, Thy mercies there remembred not: But at the Sea did Him provoke, Who yet their safety not forsook. The Red Sea he rebuk'd, and dry'd, Whose waters wall'd them on each side. And through its depths uncovered, As safe, as through the desart, led: Sav'd them from foes that did pursue; All which the waters overthrew. Then they beleev'd, and praises gave; Though soon forgat, who them did save. They lusted in the wildernes, And God by their temptations press; Who was to their request attent; Into their soules though leannes sent. They Moses in the Camp envy'd, And Aaron's office vilify'd. For which earth open'd to devour Abiram's Troops, and Dathan's pow'r. Then kindled was a furious fire, Which burnt up those that did conspire. Their hands a Calfe in Horeb made; And to the Molten Image pray'd. His glory thus who them releast Was now converted to a beast. And Egypts wonders, the Red Sea, Or Land of Ham, forgotten be. Then God, He would destroy them, said Till Moses intercession made: Who in the deadly breach did stand, To turn away His vengfull hand. His promis'd Land they now despise, And murmurs in their tents arise: That in the Desart He decreed, To scatter them, and all their seed. Second Part. To Baal Peor joyn'd, they fed On sacrifices to the dead. Still their inventions Him provoke; For which the Plague upon them broke. Then Phinebas aveng'd th' offence, And staid the mortall pestilence: Which all successions held a seale Of righteousnes, and holy zeale. Then at the waters where they strove, They did againe His anger move: Where it so ill with Moses went, He suffer'd in their punishment. Because his spirit, meek and mild, Provoked was, whilst they revil'd: And discontented for their sake, Some unadvised language spake. The sinfull Nations of the Land They not destroy'd at Gods command: But learn'd their rites, with heathens mixt; Ensnar'd, while on their Idols fixt. As gifts to Divels offered, Their Sonnes, and daughters blood they shed: Whose guiltless lives to Idols slaine Did all the Land of Canaan staine. Thus they defil'd a whoring went, In impious works themselves invent. Therefore the Lords enkindled rage Abhorred His own heritage. He gave Them up to Heathen pow'rs; Their haters made Their conquerours: Opprest they were, by foes subdu'd; Yet sav'd, as oft their sins renew'd. But hearing their afflicted Cry, He pitty'd their calamity. He most compassionate, and kind, His Covenant recall'd to mind, And in his mercy did repent The sharpnes of their punishment. He made ev'n those with pity look, Who Them before had captives took. Save us, O Lord our God! protect, And from the Heathen us collect: To thank thy Name through all our daies And triumph in Thy mercies praise. O let the God of Israel Be blest, whose benefits excell. To Him be praises endless pay'd: And let Amen by all be say'd. Psal. CVII. Sing this as the Lamentation. [First Part] O thank the goodnes of our God, Whose mercy knowes no period. Let Israel confess, His hands Have gather'd them from forraigne lands: From North, and South, &amp; East, and West, Where they no City had to rest: But in the wildernes disperst, With hunger pin'd, and faint with thirst. Then they their Cries to God address, Who them deliver'd from distress. He them directed in his way, To find a City for their stay. O then that men would praise the Lord, Who such great goodness doth afford: Recording both by tongue and pen His wonders to the sons of men. The longing soul He satiates still, The hungry doth with goodness fill, Who sit in darkness, and death's shade, In iron and affliction lay'd. Because 'gainst God they did rebell, And from His words, and counsaile fell, Therefore their heart by labours broke Found none to ease them from their yoake. Then they their cries to God address, Who them deliver'd from distress: He them from death and darknes brought, And freedome from their bondage wrought, O then that men would praise the Lord, Who such great goodnes doth afford; Recording both by tongue and pen His wonders to the Sons of men. For He the gates of brass hath broke, The iron barres in sunder strook. The foolish for their acted sin Have by His hand afflicted bin. So that their soul in sicknes cast, Abhorring meat, could nothing tast. Then they their cries to God address; Who them deliver'd from distress. His word He sent them, which reveal'd, Their sorrowes, and dejections heal'd. O then that men would praise the Lord, Who such great mercies doth afford; Recording both by tongue and pen His wonders to the Sons of men. And let their Songs of gladnes rise, To pay their thankfull sacrifice. Second Part. They that in ships their trafick keep, Behold Gods wonders in the deep. For he commands the storme to blow, Whose billowes them to heaven throw: Then downe they fall, as if their graves Were made beneath the gaping waves. They stagger to and fro, and reele, And like a drunkard rowles the keele. Then they their cries to God address, Who them delivers from distress: He calmes the storme, whose rage gives ore; And lands them on the wished shore. O then that men would praise the Lord, Who such great goodnes doth afford; Recording both by tongue and pen His wonders to the Sons of men. In great assemblies bless his Name, And 'mongst the Elders speak his fame: Who rivers like a desart dryes; Makes parched sands, where springs did rise. He barren makes a fruitfull ground, For sins which in the Land abound. Then to a poole the desart brings, And turns dry grounds to water springs. There He the hungry soules hath fill'd, That they may live, and Cities build: To plant the vine, and sowe the field, Which may hir fruits with plenty yield. He multiplies, and gives them peace, Their flocks not suff'ring to decrease. Againe they few, when sinfull, grow; His punishments then brought them low. He mighty Princes puts to scorne, Makes them like wanderers forlorne. Yet setteth He the poor on high, And spreads like flocks his family. The righteous will rejoyce to see, When envies mouth shall stopped be. Who so is wise, will hence record The loving kindnes of the Lord. Psal. CVIII. O God my heart is fix'd, and bent, Prepared my intent. I will Thy might in songs of praise, And glorious ditties raise. Wake Psaltery, and harp awake, The morning I will take; That through the world my early verse Thy praises may disperse. Thy mercy 'bove the Heaven extends, Thy truth the clouds transcends. Be Thou exalted 'bove the skies, 'Bove earth in glory rise. That Thy beloved still may be From all invasion free; Thy right hand in their safety reare, And their petitions heare. God by his truth did oft profess, He would his servants bless. I will divide faire Shechems soile, And Succoths valley spoile. Manasseh, Gilead, both are mine, In war shall Ephraim shine: But Iudah's Scepter all must aw, And give my people Law. Moab shall be a dunghill grow'n, Proud Edom overthrow'n. Philistia's boasted triumphs shall Be buried in hir fall. Who mee will to the City lead, Fierce Edoms strength and head? That I may breake hir fensed gate, And trample on hir state? O Thou my God, who cast'dst us off, And mad'st our force their scoff! Wilt not Thou with our armies go, To quell th' insulting foe? From trouble save us once againe; For help of man is vaine. Through God we shall in battaile rise, And foyle our enemies. Psal. CIX. Sing this as the Lamentation. God of my praise! nor silent be, Nor unattentive unto me. For wicked mouths me falsely wrong, And wound me with their lying tongue. They compass me with words of hate, And causeless vex me with debate. For all my friendship they are foes: But I my grief in pray'r disclose. My good with evill they requite, And my affection pay with spight. Let wicked rulers him command, And Satan stand at his right hand, Let him, when judg'd, receive his doome, And let his pray'r, his sin become. His daies both few, and irksome make, His office let another take. May fatherless his children live; His wife forlorne, a widow grieve: Like vagrants let them want their bread; And, where they beg it, not be fed. Let him be made extortions spoyle, And strangers reap his harvests toyle. None him their pitties object make, Nor on his seed compassion take. His name from earth, and Off-spring blot, In the succeeding age forgot. And ever let the Lord retaine His Fathers sin, and Mothers staine. Still let them stand before His ey, To cut from earth his memory: Who merciless the poor pursu'd, And wounds of broken hearts renew'd. Feele he those curses which he lou'd; All blessings be from him remov'd. As curses cloath'd him round about, So seize they him, within, without; Like water through his bowels flow'd, Or oyle into his bones bestow'd: So let them cloath, and gird him fast, Returning on himself at last. Thus let the Lord reward my foes, Who to reproach my soul expose. But for the mercies of Thy Name, Deliver me (O Lord) from shame. For I am poor, and prest with need; My wounded heart doth inward bleed. I like the falling shadow go; As puffs of wind the Locusts throw. My feeble knee through fasting failes, And faintnes ore my flesh prevailes: I am their scorne and laughter bred, They looking on me shake their head. Help me (O Lord!) who mercy crave; That they may know, thy hand can save, Bless when they curse; their pride confo?d, But let me live with gladnes crown'd. Lord! let my shamed enemy In sharp confusion cloathed ly. So shall Thy praises with my tongue Be in the full assembly sung. For God will at the poor's right hand, By His protection, ready stand; To save his innocence from them, Who wrongfully his soul condemne. Psal. CX. The Lord, whose pow'r all things doth sway, Unto my Lord did say: Sit at my right hand, till thou see, Thy foes Thy foot-stool be. The Lord Thy Scepter shall extend, And strength from Sion send; That all Thine enemies below May to Thy Kingdome bow. The people in great numbers shall That day before Thee fall; Whose glorious Birth, and youthfull hue Is as the morning dew. The Lord hath sworne, who not repents His long decreed intents, Thou do'st from great Melchisedek Thy Royall Priest-hood take. God at Thy right hand Kings shall wound, And Nations strong confound: Whose countries shall be overspread With Bodies of their dead. He of the River in the way Shall drink, his thirst to stay: And his victorious head advance In our Deliverance. Psal. CXI. To the usuall Tune. Praise God: with heart and tongue, The Quire of Saints among, His praises shall be sung. The works of God are great; All those will them repeat, Whose thoughts on Him are set. His actions glorious are, Renown'd and honour'd far; Nor can His truth empaire: His wonders fill our thought, Who hath compassion wrought; And pitty shewes, when sought. He hath His servants fed, Giv'n those, that fear Him, bread, His Cov'nant stablished: His pow'r to them exprest, And made His people rest, Where Heathen late possest. What ever wrought His hands, In truth and judgment stands, And sure are His Commands: They all for ever last, By His decree kept fast, Till fleeting time is past. He did His people save, Whom Tyrants did enslave; His sacred Cov'nant gave: Renowned is His fame, And reverend His Name, Which all the world proclaime. God's fear true wisdome brings; The knowledg of good things From that beginning springs. They understand aright, Who make His Lawes their light, And still His praise recite. Psal. CXII. Blest is the man that feares the Lord, Delighting in His word: His seed on earth shall mighty be, Blest his posteritie. His house with riches shall abound, His life with plenty crown'd. His righteous dealing, clear as sure, For ever shall endure. In shades of darknesse to th' upright There riseth up a light. He gratious is, and free from hate, His heart compassionate. A good man mercy shewes, and lends; Nor in his words offends: He shall not move, but placed be In lasting memorie. He, of ill tidings not afraid, Hath God his refuge made: Thus fix'd, his heart shall never faile, But 'gainst his foes prevaile. With liberall hand unto the poor He hath disperst his store, His righteousnesse shall still remaine, And lasting honour gaine. The wicked man, when this he seeth, For spight shall gnash his teeth: And, melted by his envies fire, Perish in his desire. Psal. CXIII. To the usuall Tune. The Lord O ye His servants praise, To His great Name your ditties raise, Which blest and sacred be alwaies: Ev'n from the rising of the Sun, Till to the West his course be run, Nis Name is to be prais'd alone. The Lord above all Nations high, Is seated in great Majesty, And in the Heav'ns His glories ly. What pow'r created parallells The Lord our God who thus excells, And far above the Heaven dwells? Who humbling downe himselfe doth bow, Not only things in heaven to know, But what is done in earth below. To him that did in dust deplore, He joyfull comforts doth restore; And from the dunghill lifts the poore: That set with Princes of the earth, And persons of a Royall birth, His sorrows may be chang'd to mirth The barren woman, when implor'd His bounty hath with children stor'd: O therefore praise this gratious Lord. Psal. CXIV. When Israel from Egypt went Free from his banishment, And Iacob came from that strange land, Conducted by God's hand: The house of Iudah, which did passe, His Sanctuary was: And Israel the chosen throne Of His dominion. The Sea saw that, and did disperse, Iordan his course reverse. The Mountaines skip'd like sporting rams, The little hills like Lambs. What ay'ld thy waters, O thou Sea, That they so fled from thee? Iordan, what did thy current lack, That thou wast driven back? What Miracle did then prevaile, That both your streams should faile? You Mountaines, that ye skip'd like rams? Ye little hills like Lambs? Tremble thou earth, when Iacobs God Commands thee with his rod: Who from the Rock did waters bring, And made the flint a spring. Psal. CXV. Sing this as Psalme 51. Not unto us (O Lord!) but Thee, Thy Name, Thy Truth, the glory be. Why should the heathen Thee defy, Whilst, Where is now their God? they cry? Our God in heaven doth remaine, And acts what ere he did ordaine. Their Idols Silver are, and Gold: The work which hands of men did mould Mouths have they, yet they speechlesse be; And they have eyes, but cannot see: They ears possesse, which nothing heare; And noses, not for smelling, beare. Their hands not touch, their feet not walk Nor through their throat resounds their talk Who make them are as vaine as they; And so are all that to them pray. O Israel! O Aarons line! O yee that in His feare combine! Trust ye in God, who is your shield; Protection He, and help doth yield. He, mindfull still of our redresse, Will Israel, and Aaron blesse. Who feare Him, small or great, are blest And in their race shall be encreast. You are the blessed of the Lord, Who heaven fram'd, and earth hath stor'd: He in the Heav'n of Heavens lives, But earth unto mans children gives. The dead Thy praises cannot shew, Nor those who downe to silence go: But we the Lord through all our daies Will blesse. The Lord for ever praise. Psal. CXVI. I love the Lord, and am well pleas'd, He hath me heard, and eas'd. Whilst therefore life continue shall, I will upon Him call. The snares of death about me dwelt, And paines of Hell I felt. Disturbed thoughts, and heavinesse My conscience did oppress. Then to the Lord my plaint I made, And thus unto Him said: O Lord! my soule from falling save, And lift me from the grave. The Lord is gracious, and just, To those His mercy trust: His Hand the simple doth protect, When crosses them deject. Turne then my soule unto thy rest; God's favours have thee blest. He bountifully doth reward, And thee from dangers guard. Thou keep'st my soule from death's pale feares, My drooping eyes from teares, And did'st my wand'ring steps recall, When I was apt to fall. My feet before the Lord shall stand In His eternall land. I therefore pray'd, and thus believ'd; Yet still my heart was griev'd. For in my foes successe I fail'd, Till faith at last prevail'd: Then I all men for Lyars knew, And God alone for true. What retribution shall I give To him by whom I live? Or what acknowledgment apply, For His benignity? Salvations sacred Cup I'le take, And humble prayers make. Before His people shall be pay'd The vowes which I have made. For those that live like Saints upright, And in the Lord delight, Are living dear unto His eye, And pretious when they dy. Lord I Thy faithfull servant am, And still adore Thy Name. Thou loosed hast my heavy yoak, My bonds in sunder broke. Therefore my praises unto Thee Shall daily offer'd be: My gratitude and pray'r shall rise, Like thankfull sacrifice. The vowes shall be, which I have made, Before the people pay'd, Who in Thy house and sacred Courts To praise Thy Name resorts. Psal. CXVII. O all ye Nations record, The Praises of the Lord; Ye people through the Universe, Your Makers praise rehearse. For He to us great kindness shewes, And Mercies large bestowes. His constant Truth no time decaies: The Lord for ever praise. Psal. CXVIII. O thank the goodness of our God, Whose mercy knowes no period. Let Israel their voices joyne; Let those who come from Aarons loyne, Let all who feare the Lord confesse His mercies everlastingnesse. I call'd upon Him, when distrest; Who me enlarged, and releast. The Lord Himselfe is on my side; I fearlesse mans attempts abide. He takes their part who succour me: I shall my haters ruin'd see. 'Tis bettet in the Lord to trust, Than leane on man, who is but dust: Better rely on His defense, Then put in Princes confidence. All Nations me encompass'd round; But His great Name shall them confound: They closely set against me came, But I destroy'd them in His Name. Like bees they thick about me swarm'd, Yet through His Name I was unharm'd: As kindled Thorns, which blazing dy, They quenched in their ashes ly. Though pressing foes my fall assay'd, The Lord Himself became may aid: God is my health, my strength, my song, Lowd joyes the Righteous are among. For God's Right hand's lift up on high, His Right hand acts most valiantly. I shall not dy, but live to praise, And speake His wonders all my daies. Although the Lord me chast'ned sore, He unto death not gave me ore. Open His sacred Gates, that I With praise the Lord may glorify. This is the Gate, through which the just And righteous Persons enter must. Thee wil I thank, who heard'st my voice, And mak'st me in Thy help rejoyce. That stone the builders from them lay'd, The Head is of the Corner made. This is Gods act; which in our eyes Religious wonder multiplies: This is the day the Lord hath made, We will rejoyce, in it be glad. Save now, and prosper we intreat, O Lord! who art as good, as great. He blessed be, comes in His Name; We blessings from God's house proclaime. God is the Lord, whose light hath shin'd; Pure Off'rings to His Altar bind. Thou art my God, I Thee will praise, And in my Song Thine honour raise. O thank the goodnesse of our God, Whose mercy knowes no period. Psal. CXIX. ALEPH. Blessed are They, who undefil'd, Nor in their waies beguil'd, God's Lawes obay, His statutes keep, And with their whole heart seek. No wicked act seduc'd them hath, Or turn'd them from His path; For Thou command'st, that from Thy Law We never should withdraw. O that my waies were so upright, I keep Thy statutes might: Thou wilt not me with shame reject, Who Thy commands respect. My heart to praise Thee will delight, When taught Thy judgments right: Thy statutes I my rule will make; O never me forsake. BETH. How shall a young man clense his way? Nere from Thy word to stray. My heart doth seek, and Thee prefer; Let not my goings err. Thy word I hid my heart within, To keep me free from sin. Blessed art Thou, O Gratious Lord; Teach me to do Thy word. My lips desist not to declare, How just Thy judgments are: Thy testimonies make me glad, Above all riches had. I will Thy precepts meditate, And to Thy waies relate. Thy statutes are my cheif delight, Kept in my mind, and sight. GIMEL. Deale well with me, that whil'st I live, I may observance give: Discover to my opened eyes Thy Law's high mysteries. A stranger I on earth abide; Thy precepts do not hide. My fainting soul, with longing tir'd, Thy judgments hath desir'd. With curses Thou the proud hast strook, Who Thy Commands forsook. Reproach, and scorne from me remove; For I Thy precepts love. Princes did sit, and 'gainst me speak, But I Thy statutes seek. Thy word my only joy I make, And from It counsaile take. DALETH. My soul unto the dust doth cleave; Yet me in death not leave. I to Thine eare my waies reveale, Thy statutes not conceale. Informe me in Thy precepts well, That I Thy works may tell. My melting soule with greif doth wast; O quicken me at last. Remove from me the way of lies, That I Thy Law may prize. The waies of Truth my Soule doth choose; Thy judgments I propose. Thy testimonies are my aime; Lord put me not to shame: Who from Thy Law will nere depart, When Thou enform'st my heart. HE. Teach me Thy statutes to intend, And keep them to the end. Inform'd, I shall Thy Lawes each part Observe with my whole heart: Guide me in Thy commands aright, For theirein I delight. My heart unto Thy Lawes divine, Not avarice, incline. Quicken Thou me, and turne mine eye From seeing vanity. Thy word establish in my eare, Devoted to Thy feare. Remove my fear'd reproaches far, For good Thy judgments are: And me, Thy precepts who desire, With quick'ning grace inspire. VAU. Thy saving mercies grant me Lord, According to Thy word. So shall I answer scornes unjust, Because in Thee I trust. Thy Truth from out my mouth nere take, Who it my comfort make. So I Thy Law, and holy will, For ever shall fulfill. Enlarg'd I walk at liberty, Thy precepts to descry: Which, daunted nor with fear, nor shame, I will to Kings proclaime. On Thy Commands my love I place, And joyfully embrace: With lifted hands, and heart, prostrate On these I meditate. ZAIN. Remember Lord! Thy promise made, Wherein my hope is lay'd: This quickens me, though dead with greif In trouble gives releif. Thy Law, though proud men me deride, I never have deny'd: Thy judgments old I call'd to mind, And present comfort find. Horrour and trembling me surprise, When sinners Thee despise. I sing Thy statutes all my age, In lifes short pilgrimage. Thy name at night comes to my thought Who have Thy precepts sought. This comfort I performed saw, Because I kept Thy Law. CHETH. Thou art my Lot; I said, (O Lord!) That I would keep Thy word. With my whole heart I favour crave; Let me Thy mercy have. My waies I mark'd, and turn'd my feet, Within Thy Rules to meet. To keep Thy statutes hast I made, With duty, not delay'd. By wicked bands though robb'd, &amp; spoyl'd I nere from Thee recoyl'd. At midnight I my selfe will raise, To sing Thy Judgments praise. I am their friend, and hold them deare, Who Thee obey, and feare. Through earth (O Lord) Thy mercies reach; Me in Thy statutes teach. TETH. Thoust hast dealt well with me, O Lord! According to Thy word. Good judgment and true knowledge give, For I Thy Lawes believe. Before I troubled was, I stray'd; But now Thy word obey'd: All good doth from Thy bounty flow; Let me Thy statutes know. The proud by Lies would me supplant, Who keep Thy Covenant: Their heart is swoll'n with fat, and ease; But me Thy statutes please. Tis good, that by affliction taught, To know Thee I am brought; Whose Law I in more value hold Then thousand heaps of Gold. IOD. I have been fashion'd by Thy hand; Teach me to understand: Who feare Thee shall be glad to see My setled hope in Thee. I know Thy judgments (Lord) are true; And my affliction due. Yet let Thy comfort, I Thee pray, Thy servants grief allay. In tender mercy me forgive, That I with Thee may live. Shame them, whose pride without a cause, Hates me, who love Thy Lawes. Let those conjoyn'd to me be neare; Thy truth who know, and feare; My heart keep in Thy statutes sound, That me no shame confound. CAPH. My soule, for Thy salvation faint, Trusts on Thy gratious grant. Mine eyes with expectation faile; When shall my hopes prevaile? Though like a bottle in the smoake, Yet Thee I not forsook. Shall my short daies of life have end, Ere Thou Thy judgment send? The proud for me against all right Have digged pits in spight: As Thou art faithfull, send redresse, 'Gainst them who me oppresse. They me on earth almost consum'd; But I on Thee presum'd. O quicken me, as Thou art kind, So I Thy word shall mind. LAMED. Thy promise (Lord) doth ever last, In heaven setled fast: Thy faith, through all successions try'd, Doth fixt as earth abide: Thou for Thy service did'st ordaine, That all things should remaine. But that Thy Law was my releif, I perisht had through greif. Thy precepts in my thought shall live, For they my soule revive. Save me (O Lord!) for I am Thine, And to Thy Law encline. Though wicked men would me destroy, I make Thy word my joy: Which to eternall blisse extends, When earth's perfection ends. MEM. Thy Law how dearely do I rate All day to meditate? Which still before me, makes me wise, Above mine enemies. For studying this, I knowledge have, More then my teachers gave. I understand more then the old, 'Cause I Thy precepts hold. My feet from evill waies refrain'd, Are by Thy word restrain'd: I from Thy judgments not depart; For Thou hast taught my heart. Then honybred from flowry fields, Thy word more sweetnesse yields. Through this I understanding gat; And waies of falsehood hate. NUN. Thy word a lamp is shining bright, And to my path a light. I in my solemne vowes have sworne, Thy statutes to performe. I ly perplext with greif and paine; Lord! quicken me againe. O let my Pray'rs Thy audience reach, And me Thy judgments teach. My soul, though death &amp; dangers threat, Can never Thee forget: And though the wicked snares have lay'd From Thee I never stray'd. Thy statutes are my chosen part, The comfort of my heart; And to performe Them I intend, Untill my life shall end. SAMECH. I hate vaine thoughts, ill men neglect: But I Thy Law affect. Thou art my refuge and my shield, Whose word doth safety yield. Depart ye wicked ones away; I will my God obey: Uphold me in a life unblam'd, Nor let my hope be sham'd. Sustaine me (Lord!) so shall my faith, Resting on Thee, be safe. Thou tread'st them downe, whose guilefull heart Doth from Thy Lawes depart; And, like the drosse that's cast away, Mak'st them on earth decay. My trembling flesh is full of feare, When I these judgments heare. AIN. Lord! leave me not, who love the right, To my oppressors might: Be Thou my surety 'gainst their pride, Who have my waies decry'd. Mine eyes for Thy salvation faile, Untill my hopes prevaile. In mercy with Thy servant deale; Thy statutes (Lord!) reveale. Give me an understanding heart; Thy sacred will impart: Tis time for Thee to bring Thy aid, For voyd Thy Law is made. I Thy Commandments pretious hold, Above refined gold: And all Thy precepts justly prize; But hate deceit and lyes. PE. Thy testimonies wond'rous are, My soules delight and care: Thy words like beams of light arise, To make the simple wise. Panting, and breathlesse in desire, I to Thy lawes aspire: Such mercy (Lord) upon me powre, As those who Thee adore. Order my steps, no sins may staine, Nor vices or'e me reigne. From man's oppression me redeeme, Thy precepts who esteeme. Make Thy blest face on me to shine; Teach me Thy Lawes divine: Rivers of Teares run down mine eyes, When men Thy Law despise. TSADDI. Thou righteous art, (O Lord) my might, Thy judgments are upright. The Statutes which Thou do'st command, Unchang'd and faithfull stand. My zeale consumes me, when I find Thy Law not kept in mind: Thy word is very pure and try'd, By me most magnify'd. I, though despis'd and lightly set, Thy precepts not forget: Thy righteousnesse no period knew, And Thy Commands are true. Though troubles me, or anguish seize, Yet I delight in these: Lord! in Thy statutes knowledge give, And I shall ever live. COPH. I cry'd with my whole heart! Lord heare, Through whom I persevere. O save me, when to Thee I call; So keep Thy Lawes I shall. My cryes prevent the dawning light; My eyes outwatch the night: That I Thy word might meditate, My hope, and safe Retreit. O Lord my voice in mercy heare, Me quicken in Thy feare. Men bent to mischeif nigh me draw, Contemners of thy Law: Yet Thou O Lord art neare at hand, And true is Thy command. For on eternall bases plac't, Thy testimonies last. RESCH. Consider me in my distresse: For I Thy Law confesse. Plead Thou my cause, and life afford, According to Thy word. Salvation far from sinners flies? For they Thy Lawes despise. Thy tender mercies (Lord) exceed: O quicken me with speed. Though many foes 'gainst me combine, From Thee I not decline. With sorrow I transgressors saw, Who have not kept Thy Law. Lord! think how I Thy precepts love: Inspire me from above. Thy word is true, Thy Judgments pure, And ever shall endure. SCHIN. Princes pursue me without cause; Yet still I feare Thy Lawes: Whose sacred word more glads my mind, Then those that treasures find. I falshood hate, abhorre all lyes; But Thy Commandments prize. Sev'n times each day my tongue displayes Thy righteous judgments praise. Great peace have those Thy Law attend, Nothing shall them offend. Lord! I in Thy salvation hope, And make Thy will my scope. My soule Thy testimonies loves, And them 'bove all approves; And constantly Thy Law obeyes, Who searchest all my waies. TAU. Accept (O Lord) my lowd complaint, And knowledge to me grant. Let my request admission crave, And in Thy promise save. So shall my lips Thy praises reach, When Thou my heart dost teach: My tongue Thy statutes shall recite: For Thy commands are right. O let Thine hand bring help to me, Whose choise Thy precepts be. My thoughts for Thy salvation long, My cheifest joyes among. Let my soule live Thy Name to praise, Whose judgments me shall raise: I like a lost sheep went astray; O Lord my wand'rings stay. Psal. CXX. With troubles prest, and drown'd in grief I called for relief: When God unto my help appear'd, And my Petition heard. Lord save me from their cruell lies, Who would my life surprize. Make not my soule their envies bait, To perish by deceit. What vengeance doth to Thee belong, O false and perjur'd tongue? Sharp arrowes, and a quenchlesse fire, Shall one day be thy hire. Wo unto me, constrain'd to dwell So far from Jsrael; That I in Mesech sojourne must, And Tents of Kedar trust. My Soule this long time doth converse With dispositions fierce: Who shunned have, like some disease, The happy fruits of peace. To quench wars flame, and lessen strife, I labour'd all my life: But They, when Treaties were my care, For lasting war prepare. Psal. CXXI. Sing this as the Prayer after the Commandements. Up to the Hills I lift mine eyes, From whence my help and comfort rise. My safety from the Lord doth spring, Who made the world, and every thing. Thy foot from falling He protects, Nor Slumbers He, nor thee neglects. Behold, that Lord who Israel keeps, Unweary'd is, and never sleeps. God is thy Keeper, like a shade Which on thy right hand is display'd. The Sun by day thee shall not smite, Nor vapours of the Moon by night. The Lord shall Thee preserve from harme; Thy soule against temptations arme. Thy going out, and comming in For evermore His care have bin. Psal. CXXII. I was right glad, and joyfull made When They unto me said; Let us unto God's House repaire, And worship Him with pray'r. O blest Ierusalem! our feet Within Thy Gates shall meet; Who builded like a City art, United in each part. To Thee the Tribes of God ascend, Their praises to commend; And by their zeale the rest enflame, To blesse their Makers Name. There are the great Tribunals plac't, By publick justice grac't. There is the Palace and the Throne, Which David sits upon. O pray for Salems lasting peace, That it may nere decrease: They still shall prosper, from whose love These happy wishes move. With peace thy wals encircled be, Sweet concord dwell in Thee: And let thy Palaces abound, With fullest plenty crown'd. I for my brethrens sake will pray, Peace may within thee stay. And for the House of Gods aboad Will ever seek Thy good. Psal. CXXIII. I unto Thee lift up mine eyes, O thou who rul'st the skies, And in the highest Heav'ns dost dwell, Whose brightness none can tell. As servants wait their Lords command, And Maids their mistresse hand: On God so do our eyes depend Till He his mercy send. O Lord! some pity on us shew, To end our painfull woe. Or we reproached, and unpriz'd, Are utterly despis'd. Our soule afflicted daily mournes, Fill'd with excessive scornes. Whil'st those who live in ease, and pride, Our wretched state deride. Psal. CXXIV. To the proper Tune. Now Israel This truth may gladly tell: But that the Lord Did help to us afford; If He our side With strength had not supply'd, When banding foes Against our safety rose, Their kindled ire Had swallow'd us like fire. The angry flood Had then above us stood, Who by the streame Quite overwhelm'd had been; And swelling waves Become our timeless graves: Whil'st ore our soule The billowes proudly rowle. Blest be His aid, Who us their prey not made. Our resku'd soules, Like late-entangled fowles, Escaped are Out of the deadly snare: Broke is the net, And we at freedom set. In His great Name, Who Heav'n and earth did frame, Our ruin stay'd, And help on Him is lay'd. Another of the same. Now Israel may truly say, In honour of this day; Had not the Lord our quarrell took, All help had us forsook. Yea had not God our battailes fought, When men our ruin sought; And when our close conspiring foes Against our safety rose; The wrath, which in their breasts did strive, Had buried us alive; Consuming both our Place and Name In their revenges flame. Our Life, and what we most esteem, Had perisht in this stream; And in the furious billowes womb, Beheld our glories tomb. But let our God be alwayes prais'd, Who thus from death us rais'd: Nor made us subject to their pow'r, Who sought us to devour. From danger resku'd is our soule, Like some net scaping fowle: So broken is the bloody snare, And we deliver'd are. Our present help, and hopes of aid In God alone are lay'd; 'Tis He, who made both Heav'n and earth, That gave our comforts birth. Psal. CXXV. Who God their hope and trust account, Are like faire Sions Mount; Whose head unmoved, and unshook, Abides the tempests stroak. As rising Mountaines Salem fense, By their circumference; So God His people guards throughout, And circles them about. The wicked shall not by their pow'r The righteous Lot devour; Least they the heathens sins partake, Who them their vassalls make. Do good O Lord unto the just, Who in Thy goodnes trust. And those that are in heart upright, Continue in Thy sight. But as for such who turn'd aside, To crooked waies back-slide, The Lord their judgments shall encrease; But Iacob blesse with peace. Psal. CXXVI. When God did cast a gratious eye On Sions misery; And did his captiv'd Peoples state To liberty translate; This unexpected safety wrought On us such wonder brought, Our freedome like a vision seem'd, And we like them that dream'd. Joy fill'd our mouth, triumphant Songs Did exercise our tongues, That Heathens with amazement said, God hath This gladness made The Lord, who crownes His servants faith Great things effected hath, And makes us publish through the earth. The causes of our mirth. Lord! turne our bondage, end our woe, Let Thy full mercyes flow, As waters from the fountaines mouth, Or Rivers in the South. They who, before in teares have sow'n, And only sorrowes know'n; Shall so their future hopes employ, That they may reap in joy. He who good seed in weeping beares; And water'd with his teares, Shall doubtless find return'd with gaine, What here he sow'd in paine. A blessed harvest shall ensue, His comforts to renew; Long joyes shall spring from his short grief, And from each graine a sheaf. Psal. CXXVII. Sing this as the Lords Prayer. Except the Lord the house sustaine, The builders labour is in vaine; Except the City He defend, And to the dwellers safety send, In vaine are Centinels prepar'd, Or armed watchmen for the guard. You vainly with the early light Arise, or fit up late at night, To find support, and dayly eat Your bread with sorrow earn'd and sweat: When God, who His beloved keepes, This plenty gives with quiet sleepes. Lo! children, and the fruitfull womb, Are blessings which from Heaven come, As arrowes in a strong mans hand, So children are in youth obtain'd; Who hath his quiver full of those Shall never feare upbraiding foes. Psal. CXXVIII. Blessed is he who God doth fear, And holds His precepts deare: Thou shalt have plenty in thy meat, And of thy labours eat. Thy Wife shall, like the loving vine, Which doth thy walls entwine, With fruits enrich thy dwelling place, And multiply thy race. Thy Children shall like branches shew, Which from the Olive grow, And round about thy table stand, As blessings to thy land. These favours shall the man obtaine, Whose hopes in God remaine: The Lord shall thee from Sion bless, With all earthes happiness. Thine eyes Hierusalem shall see, Fill'd with prosperitie, And whil'st thy dayes of life endure, Hir gloryes shall be sure. Thou Childrens Children shalt behold, Spring up when thou art old, And added to thine own encrease, See Israel in peace. Psal. CXXIX. Sing this as Psalme 119. Oft vext me from my Youth have they, May Israel now say, Oft in my tender yeares assaild, Yet have they not prevail'd. My back the plowers did invade, And there long furrowes made: But God hath cut their wicked bands, And sav'd me from their hands. Let them confounded back retire, Who Sions hurt desire; Or prove like grasse on houses top, Which withers e're growne up: Which hath no mower for it found, Nor into sheaves is bound; And none that pass, God speed you, say, Or wish you prosper may. Psal. CXXX. Out from the Depths of misery, O Lord! to Thee I cry: Mark well my voice, and let Thine eare My supplication heare. If Thou, O Lord! wilt be extreame, And with thy searching beame Examine each transgression, And errour we have done: When we thus strictly shall be try'd, Who may thy sentence bide? Or who endure thy vengfull hand, And in thy judgment stand? But there is Mercy (Lord) with Thee, That Thou may'st feared be: Thy word and Promises are just, Therefore in them I trust. On Thee alone my hope is plac't, To Thee my Soule doth hast: On Thee she waites, to Thee she flyes, Before the morning rise. They that expect the morning light, After the weary night, Watch not so much the break of day, As she for Thee doth stay. O Israel trust in the Lord, Who pity doth afford! For He more ready is to save, Then we his help to crave. With Him abundant mercy is, To salve what's done amiss: And Plentifull redemption found, To cure each sinfull wound. Another of the same, paraphrased for an Antheme. Out of the horrour of the lowest Deep, Where cares &amp; endlesse fears their station keep, To thee (O Lord) I send my woful cry: O heare the accents of my misery. If Thy enquiry (Lord) should be severe, To mark all sins which have been acted here, Who may abide? or, when they fisted are, Stand un-condemned at Thy Judgments bar? But there is mercy (O my God) with Thee, That Thou by it may'st lou'd, and feared be. My Soule waites for the Lord, in Him I trust, Whose word is faithful, &amp; whose promise just. On him my longing thoughts are fixt, as they, Who wait the c?forts of the rising day: Yea more then those that watch the morning light Tir'd with the sorrowes of a rest-less night. O Israel, trust in that Gratious Lord, Who plentifull remission doth afford; And will His people, who past pardon seeme, By mercyes greater then their sins redeeme, Psal. CXXXI. O Lord! I have no haughty mind, Nor eyes to pride inclin'd. To matters great I not aspire, Nor things too high desire. But low in thought, in action mild, Like to a weaned Child, So wean'd from all earth's vanities My soule on Thee relies. Let Israel make God their scope, And in His goodnesse hope; Untill both time, and life shall end, On Him alone depend. Psal. CXXXII. Remember David's trouble Lord, His vow and oath record; How he in zeale, and holy fear, To Iacob's God did swear. I will not house my weary head, Nor go into my bed, Nor shall my eyes, with sleep opprest, Acquainted be with rest: Untill a dwelling place I find Unto the Lord design'd: And till I shall a Temple raise For the Almighty's praise. Lo, we have heard, in Ephrata Thy Arke did sometimes stay; And found, in open fields it stood, Or shelt'red by the wood. But in His Tabernacle now Our knees wee'l humbly bow: We will before His foot stool fall, And on His power call. Arise (O Lord!) into Thy Rest, Long with Thy presence blest; And let Thy Arke be fixed here, Whose strength the Nations feare. Thy Priests with holyness attire, With joy Thy Saints inspire: Do not Thy love for Davids sake, From Thine Annointed take. The Lord to David vowed hath, Nor will He break His faith, From thine owne loynes shall issue one To sit upon thy throne. And if thy Children will consent To my Commandement; Their sons, whil'st day and night remaine, Successively shall Reigne. For I the Lord have Sion chose For my desir'd repose: Within this dwelling will I rest, An everlasting guest. Hir stores with plenty shall be fed, Hir poor reliev'd with bread: Hir Priests with blessing shall be deckt, With gladness Hir Elect. There shall the Horne of David spring, In honour flourishing: And like a lamp, his glorious light Shall still continue bright. His adversaries, cloath'd with shame, Shall lose both life and name: But from his Sacred Head the Crowne Shall never be cast downe. Psal. CXXXIII. Behold how pleasant 'tis to see, When brethren do agree: Whose hearts, as dwellings, love unites, And to accord invites. 'Tis like the pretious ointment shed On Aarons sacred head, Which did from face, and beard descend, And on his garment end. 'Tis as the silver drops of dew Which Hermons top renew: Or as the fuitfull raines distill Upon faire Sions Hill. The Lord on such agreement powres His loves unwasted showres; And doth their habitations bless With endless happiness Psal. CXXXIV. Sing this as Psalme 25. Ye servants of the Lord! Bless Him with one accord. You in His House who nightly wait, His praises due relate. With lifted hands adore, And daily Him implore: Within His Sanctuary bless The Lord of Holiness. The God that Heaven made, And earth's foundation lay'd, Out of His Sion thee defend, And blessings endless send. Psal. CXXXV. Sing this as Psalme 119. Praise ye the Lord; His praise proclaime All ye that love His Name. Ye in His House, and Courts that stand, Attending His Command. O praise His goodness, bless His Name, From whom all mercies came. He Iacob chose, and on his race Did all His treasure place. Our God is great, and in His deeds All other Gods exceeds: In Heav'n, or earth, or deepest Seas, He acts what ere He please. He makes from earth the vapours rise, Which cloud the dark'ned skies: From whence He raines, and light'ning flings, And winds there treasur'd brings. He man and beast in Egypt smote, And plagues on Pharaoh brought. His arme did vanquish Nations great, And mighty Kings defeat: Sihon, and Og, and Canaan fell In lot to Israel. Therefore Thy pow'rfull Name, O Lord, Succession shall record. Thy judgments are on sinners bent; But tow'rds Thine owne relent. The Gods in Heathen Temples sought, Are gold and silver wrought. Speechless they be, and blind, and deaf, Nor in their mouths have breath. Like them the Makers are, and those Who trust in Them repose. His praise, O ye from Iacob spring, O house of Aaron sing! O house of Levi, who profess His feare, your Maker bless. From Sion let your blessings sound, Your thankfull Songs abound: Praise ye the Lord, His mercies tell, Who doth in Salem dwell. Psal. CXXXVI. To the usuall Tune. As Psalme 148. Give thanks unto the Lord, Who doth all good afford; The God of Gods, who swaies Those Lords whom earth obeyes. Who hath alone Great wonders done: His mercy sure Doth still endure. To Him who Heavens made, Earth 'bove the waters lay'd: To Him who form'd great lights, To rule our daies and nights: The Sun at noone, The Stars and Moone, Whose mercy sure Doth still endure. Who Egypts first-borne smote; And Iacob from them brought. The Red Sea parted was, For Israel to pass. But Pharaoh's host In it was lost. His mercy sure Doth still endure. Who His through desarts led; Great Kings discomfited, Sihon the Amorite; And Og, with Bashan's might; And gave their land To Iacob's hand: His mercy sure Doth still endure. Who our low state esteem'd, And from our foes redeem'd: Who to all flesh gives food, His creatures fills with good: Your thanks O bring To Heavens King; Whose mercy sure Doth still endure. Psal. CXXXVII. Sing this as Psalme 119. By Babylons swift streames we sate, Sad and disconsolate; The teares as fast ran from our ey, For Sions memory. Our harps untuned, and unstrung, Upon the Willowes hung; When those who did us captive bring, Bid us (in scorne) to sing. They, who us spoil'd with sword and fire, Did mirth of us require: Sing us (say'd They) one of the Songs, To Sion which belongs. But how shall we sing the Lords Song, His Enemies among? Or tune His Notes in strangers Land, That cannot understand? O deare Ierusalem! when I Forsake thy memory, May my skill faile, my right hand let Her cunning quite forget. Cleave to the roof O may my tongue, When I not mourne thy wrong; Or if I not preferr thy mirth Above all joyes on earth. In thy remembrance, Lord! retaine Proud Edoms fierce disdaine; Who 'gainst Ierusalem did cry, Mocking hir misery. Now she is fall'n, nere may our eyes Againe behold hir rise! Down with it, (their rude clamours sound, Rase it ev'n to the ground. O Babylon! which did'st us wast, Thy self our woes must tast: And in thy finall ruin we Sions revenge shall see. Happy are They, who to requite The measure of thy spight, Without all pitty 'gainst the stones Shall dash thy little ones. Psal. CXXXVIII. I Thee will praise with my whole heart, My thankfull hymnes impart; Before the Gods of Earth I'le sing My praise to Heaven's King. I towards Thy Temple worship will, And praises utter still: Thy word and Name shall loudly sound, Whose love, and truth abound. When in my plaints to Thee I cry'd, Thy love as soon reply'd: My fainting spirit was renew'd, With strength my soule endu'd. The Kings of earth Thy praise shall beare, When they Thy words do heare: They in the waies of God shall sing The glory of their King. For though the Lord be very high, Yet He cast's downe His eye; The meek and lowly He respects, But all the proud neglects. Though I in mid'st of trouble live, Yet Thou wilt me revive: Thy stretch'd out hand my wrathfull foes To ruin shall expose. The Lord my comforts will assure, By mercyes which endure. Cease not of me regard to take; Nor Thine own works forsake. Psal. CXXXIX. Sing this as Psalme 51. Lord! thou hast throughly searched me, I open am, and know'n to Thee: My sitting downe, and my up-rise Are not concealed from Thine eyes: Thou understand'st my distant thought, Ere it to forme my self had brought. Thou circlest in my path, and bed, And hast my waies discovered. Thou hear'st each whisper from my tongue And ere 'twas utter'd, knew'st it long. By Thee I fashion'd, am and made, Thy hand each part in order lay'd. Yet can I not the knowledge gaine, How I this being did attaine; Which doth in wonder so excell, 'Tis easier to admire, then tell. How shall I from Thy spirit fly? Or Thy all present pow'r deny? If I climbe Heav'n, 'tis Thine own Sphære: If stoop to Hell, lo, Thou art there. If borne upon the mornings wing, Far as the Sea doth swell, or spring; Thy Right hand shall protect and lead, Where ere my weary footsteps tread. If I pretend the darknes shall Upon me, like a cov'ring, fall; Those heavy fogs, those mists of night, Will quickly cleare, and turne to light. The thickest shade, or blackest cloud, Can nothing from thy knowledg shrow'd: For darkness doth like Noon-tide shine, Light'ned by brighter beams of Thine. My reines are Thine: Thou mad'st the womb My bodies cloathing to become. I will give thanks to Thee, O Lord, Who was enlived by Thy word: With awfull art, and wond'rous forme Thou did'st Thy workmanship adorne. My soule These marvels must confess, And for Thy favours daily bless. Though I was fashion'd in the dark, Too secretly for man to mark, There is no curious joynt, or bone, But was to Thy inspection know'n. Thou did'st upon my substance look, And wrot'st each member in Thy book: Thou saw'st how my imperfect frame By daily growth to figure came. O Lord, how pretious, O how deare Thy purposes and thoughts appeare! Which were they summ'd in my account, They would the num'rous sands surmount. These wonders alwaies present ly, Fixt in my thankfull memory: And whil'st of them surveies I take, My contemplation still must wake. O God! Thou shalt the wicked slay: Ye bloody men depart away: For their fowle tongues Thy honour staine, And take Thy sacred Name in vaine. Do not I hate, and grieve at those, Whose proud despight against thee rose? With perfect hate I them despise, Accounting them mine enemies. Search me (O Lord!) and prove my heart, Who Judg of all my actions art: Do Thou my faith to tryall bring, My hidden thoughts examining: Look well, and all my motions view, If I persist in waies untrue: And when Thou find'st my feet to stray, Reduce me to Thy lasting way. Psal. CXL. Save me from men to evill bent; And from the violent: Which mischeif in their hearts devise, In war, and tumult rise. Their tongues are, like a Serpents, whet; Their lips in poyson set. Lord! keep me from the raging foe, That would my feet orethrow. The proud have hidden nets prepar'd, To take my life ensnar'd. But I, Thou art my God, have said; O heare, and send me aid. O God my Lord! the strength alone Of my salvation; In day of battaile Thou my head Hast safely covered. Grant not (O Lord!) their bad desire; Least then their pride aspire. Let suddaine mischeif cover those, Who would my life enclose. Let quenchless fire upon them raine; Nor let them rise againe: No violent man, nor evill tongue On earth be stablish'd long. I know the Lord will them maintaine, Who have afflicted lay'n; Their cause regards, and doth delight To help the poor to right. For this, unto Thy Name the just Their thanks acknowledg must. And those who live upright, and well, Shall in Thy presence dwell. Psal. CXLI. To Thee I cry, O Lord, make hast To heare my voice at last. Let my request like Incense rise, Or ev'ning sacrifice. Set Thou a watch my mouth before, And keep my speeches doore; Incline not unto ill my heart, With sinners to take part. Let me not eat of that delights Their wicked appetites: But let the righteous me reprove, And smite me in his love. Like pretious balmes, or odours shed, Such stroaks not break my head; And in my pray'rs I shall them bless, In midst of their distress. When wicked Judges overthrow'n Ly dash'd against the stone; They shall with much contentment heare My words, which comfort beare. Disperst, and scatter'd on the grave, Our bones no value have: As fallen trees, cut downe, and cleft, Are in their splinters left. But though in darknes clos'd I ly, On Thee I fix mine eye: Thou wilt not leave me in the dust, In whom my soul doth trust. O keep me from the cruell net, Which wicked men have set. Let them be snar'd in their own trap; But let my soul escape. Psal. CXLII. With low'd voic'd cries to God I came, And my request did frame: I powred out my sad complaint, And shew'd Him my restraint. Thou, when my soul was drown'd in woe, My way, and path did'st know: Yet in that walk my feet did tread, Close snares for me were spread. I did upon my right hand look, But no man knowledg took: My soul of help was quite bereft, And had no refuge left. I therefore cry'd to Thee, O Lord! And said this faithfull word: Thou do'st my Help and Portion stand, In the Eternall Land. Consider then my great distress, Brought low with heaviness. From persecuters me defend, Unable to contend. My soule out of the prison bring, That I Thy praise may sing. And for this bounty shew'd to me, The just shall honour Thee. Psal. CXLIII. As Psalme 25. O Lord my Prayer heare, Presented in Thy feare: With mercy answer my request, In humblest words exprest. Weigh not in judgments scales Thy servants daily failes; For no man living, in Thine eye, Himself shall justify. My foes which do pursue My soule, by waies undue, Make me in darkness hide my head, Like those have long been dead. My Spirit faint, and worne, Is by my griefes oreborne: My heart within me desolate, Through my dejected state. Yet I the daies of old In my remembrance hold: Thy wonders past I meditate, And all Thy works of late. To Thee I stretch my hands; Like as the thirsty Lands The fruitfull raines desire to see, So thirsts my soul for Thee. Heare me, O Lord, with speed; My fainting spirit heed: Least if Thou frowne, I prove like those, The pit of Death doth close. O let my longing eare Betimes Thy kindnes heare. In Thee I trust: reveale that Path, Thy truth prescribed hath. Lord save me from their spight, Who in my wrongs delight: To Thee my soul for shelter flies, Against hir enemies. Teach me to do Thy will, That I may please Thee still: Let Thy good spirit me direct, To live with Thine elect. Lord quicken me againe; Cleanse Thou my sinfull staine; For Thy great Name, and justice sake, My soul from trouble take. I am Thy servant, Lord! My comfort is Thy word. Then of Thy goodnes those destroy, Who in my sorrowes joy. Psal. CXLIV. Blest be the Lord, my strength, my might, Who taught my hands to fight: My rock, my shield, and helper true, My people to subdue. Lord! what is man? or what his race, Thy notice should him grace? Who is so vaine, his daies do fade Like to the passing shade. O Lord, the arched Heavens bow, Come downe to earth below. Touch their proud tops, and then thy stroak Shall make the mountains smoak. From Thy full clouds quick lightning cast, And them by scatt'ring wast; Let Thy sharp arrowes, 'gainst them shot, Destruction make their lot. Send from above Thine hand, to save Me from the swelling wave. From children strange, whose mouth speaks hate, Whose right hand acts deceit. Then I new Songs will sing to Thee, Upon the Psalterie: And on the ten-string'd Instrument Ditties of praise invent. For God salvation gives to Kings; His help to David brings: From perill of the Sword, and grave, He doth His servant save. Deliver me from strangers hands, Whose mouth against Thee bands: Whose right hand falshood doth defend; Whose deeds in rapine end. Our Sons like plants then, fresh in growth, Shall flourish in their youth: Our daughters like faire columnes be, Which we in Temples see. Our garners shall be fill'd with store, Our sheep bring thousands more, Our Oxen strong; nor shall restraint Cause in our streets complaint. Happy that people, and that place, Which is in such a case: Yea blessed are, and happy, they, Who God their Lord obey. Psal. CXLV. Sing this as Psalme 100. I thee extoll, my God and King! And of Thy Name for ever sing; I Thee will bless through all my daies, And yield Thy Name eternall praise. Great is the Lord, prais'd and admir'd, His greatness is by none exquir'd. Each generation shall declare, How mighty His atchievements are. I will Thy glory celebrate, Thy wond'rous works Majestick State: Thy acts of terrour, and of fame, All men shall speak, and I proclaime. They shall abundantly profess Thy goodness, and Thy righteousness; Whose grace, and full compassions flow, To mercy swift, to anger slow. God's goodness every where extends, His mercy all His works transcends. All things (O Lord) Thou did'st create; And Saints Thy praise shall celebrate. Their tongues Thy Kingdom's rule make know'n; By them Thy glorious acts are show'n: That all the Sons of men may see Thy mighty pow'r, and Majestie. Thy Kingdom doth for ever last, When men decay, and time is past. God doth uphold all such as fall, And men cast downe from ruin call. The eye of all on Thee attend, Who in due season meat do'st send: Thy open hand, when need requires, Doth satisfie their just desires. The Lord is right in all His waies, In Holiness His works He layes. The Lord is good, and nigh to all, Who faithfully upon Him call. He their desire will satisfie, Who feare Him, and regard their cry: Saves all, that love Him, from annoy: But all the wicked will destroy. Therefore my mouth, to speake His praise, Shall lowd, and thankfull accents raise: And let all flesh, whom He did frame, For ever bless His Holy Name. Psal. CXLVI. Tto God (my soule) His praises give, And bless Him, whil'st I live. I will to Him my thankes up send, Untill my being end. Put not in Princes any trust, Nor in the Sons of dust; Who nor themselves, nor others save From the devouring grave. Soon as man breathless doth remaine, He turnes to earth againe. And, as his time of life expires, So perish his desires. O therefore happy he, whose faith On God relyance hath: Who makes the fear of Him his scope, And object of his hope. He Heav'n and earth and Sea did frame, With all that Those containe: And when their forme is quite defac't, His truth shall ever last. He doth the wronged help to right, Who are opprest by might: Feeds those that are to want expos'd; And hath the Captives loos'd. He to the blind restores their eyes, He makes the fall'n to rise: He upon such bestowes his care, Who just and faithfull are. The Lord all strangers doth receive, And fatherless releive: When wicked men are overthrowne, And all their hopes cast downe. The Lord thy God, O Sion, reignes, His glory still remaines. Then to thy everlasting King Eternall praises sing. Psal. CXLVII. Praise ye the Lord: a pleasant thing It is, His praise to sing. God ruin'd Salem doth repaire: Whose out-casts gather'd are. He heales and binds the broken heart, Relieves the wounded's smart: The sparkling Starres He numbers all, And by their names doth call. Great is our Lord, and strong His might, His Wisdome infinite: He doth the meek exalt, and crowne; But cast's the wicked downe. To God the Lord, so good, so great, Your thankfull hymnes repeat; And to the Harpes melodious string His constant praises sing. Who heavens face with vapour shrowds, And covers it with clouds: Who powres his raine on earth below, And makes the Mountaines grow. He gives his food unto the beast; And, from their airy nest When the young ravens to Him cry, Feeds Them abundantly. He not delights in strength of horse, Nor values humane force: But those who make His feare their scope, And in His mercy hope. Ierusalem O praise the Lord; Sion, Thy God record: Who barres thy gates, to give thee rest, And hath thy children blest. He maketh in thy borders peace; Fills thee with cornes increase. His wing'd commands most swiftly run, And, soon as said, are done. He giveth, like the wooll, his snowes, Hoare frost like ashes strowes: Casts forth his Ice, like morsells roll'd. Who can withstand His cold? He sendeth out His word, and Law, Which melts them to a thaw: He causeth His strong wind to blow, And makes the waters flow. His word He doth to Iacob shew, Makes him His judgment know. And to his chosen Israel He doth His Statutes tell. He with no Nation so did deale, Nor thus His Love reveale; Who nor His judgments knew, nor word: Therefore, Praise ye the Lord. Psal. CXLVIII. To the proper Tune. Praise God from Heaven high, Who sits above the sky: Ye glorious Angels all, Ye Hosts Celestiall; Ye Sun and Moon, Both Night and Noon, Ye Stars of light His praise recite. Praise Him ye Heavens that move, Ye waters them above, Praise Him, whose pow'rfull Name Created This great frame. He did command Them fast to stand: By His decree They lasting be. All that earth's bosome keeps, Ye dragons, and all deepes: Fire, haile, the falling snow, The furious winds that blow: Stormes that fulfill His sacred will, And serve His word, Praise ye the Lord. Mountaines, that touch the sky; Ye Hills, which lower ly; All trees that fruitfull are, The Cedars tall and faire: Beasts, which the field, Or pastures yeild; Each creeping thing; And bird of wing. Kings, which the earth do sway, People, who them obey: Princes of royall birth, And Judges of the earth: Young men, and maids, Old men, and babes, Let them proclaime His awfull name: His Name doth all excell, In earth, or Heaven that dwell: He will His People raise, Of all His Saints the praise: Ev'n Iacob deare, His care most neare; Joyn'd in accord, Praise ye the Lord. Psal. CXLIX. Sing this as Psalme 119. Praise ye the Lord: New Anthems bring, Which ye to God may sing: And let the quire of Saints His praise In their assembly raise. Let Israel in Him rejoyce, Who form'd him with his voyce: Let all the Sons, from Sion spring, Be joyfull in their King. Let them with Dance, and Pipe proclaime The glory of His Name: Let them sing praises with the Harp, With Timbrell shrill and sharp. For in His people He delights, Who celebrate His Rites: And those with meekness who abound, Are with salvation crown'd. Let Saints with glory raise their heads, And sing upon their beds: Let His high praise, who rules the skies, Their voices exercise. And in their hand a Two-edg'd sword Be put, to act His word, For judgment 'gainst the Heathen bent, And peoples punishment: Their captive Kings in chaines confin'd, With manacles to bind, And their rebellious Nobles lead In iron fettered. To execute that heavy wrath His judgment threat'ned hath: And in faire Characters engrave; His Saints such honour have. Psal. CL. Praise ye the Lord, your Songs address To praise His Holynes: O praise Him in His pow'rs extent, Who rules the firmament. Praise Him for all His acts of might, Our wonder which invite: In praises due His greatness tell, Which all things doth excell. Praise Him with Trumpets lofty sound, With Cornets shake the ground: His praise the Psaltery inspire, With the melodious Lyre. Praise him with Timbrells, and advance His honour in the Dance. Praise Him with Organs, Violls, Flutes, And the well-stringed Lutes. With Cymbals loud Him magnify, Praise Him on Cymbals high: Let every creature, that hath breath, His Maker praise till death.
