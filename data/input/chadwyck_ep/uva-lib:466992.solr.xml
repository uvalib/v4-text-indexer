      <field name="fulltext">ELEGIES. I. ?????????? ???????? . . . ?????? ?? ????? ??? ???????. Eustath. ad Il. B. ‚ÄúShe died a maiden . . . departing at nineteen. II. ??? ?? ????? ?????, ???? ??? ????? ????? ????? ??????, ??? ?????????? ????. Soph. Electra. ‚ÄúNow far from home, a fugitive in other lands, sadly hast thou perished, severed from thy sister.‚Äù [I.] Two jewels lost‚ÄîOh, long-divided pair! Backward through time I turn to look for them, And one I find beneath a cypress stem Hid many a summer deep‚Äîthe other, where? By time and space so far asunder tost, That, in a dreamland early casketed, This, in the after years so wildly lost‚Äî Few miss them now, few count the long since dead. Two phantoms cross the ocean to my soul; One steals like moonlight o'er the darkening blue; One seems to sweep through stormshine to its goal, Then wild with heartbreak flashes out of view. But now, so dim with mist the sky and sea, None cares to stand and watch for them with me; Yet tost by time and space so far apart, Brother and Sister! meet within my heart! Erinna died, a flame extinguished soon‚Äî For flame she was, of such enchanted fire As once soared upward on Arabia's noon, When the last Ph≈ìnix vanished from the pyre. But half a child through all her childish time, Still half a child in girlhood's strenuous prime, By Duty's bride-ring with such passion worn, By Fancy's sparkling, flowery, fairy wand, That wrought grave wonders in her firm young hand‚Äî By Nature's own sweet science at grey morn Revealed, in wandering woodland-studies dear‚Äî By these inspired, and ancient lore austere, And the full heart that ever rushed to meet The Fair and Good, and worship at their feet‚Äî She lived on heights and knew not they were high, On fire, and knew not other souls were cold; She would have learnt it all, but was to die Ere yet her eaglet-wings she could unfold For her true mates to search the world, and ask Her share in their appointed beauteous task. Some task was waiting for her, so we deem, Its hopes, its fears, its failures, all untried; But now her little lifetime seems a dream, So long ago, and so unknown she died. Now the red rose-leaf on the pure young cheek, More childlike as time moves, and leaves her there, And eyes which sprang up ere the lips could speak, Melt into shadow through the drooping hair. Now all that girlhood, now that flushed, intense, Young fever, are a whisper of the night, A faint sweet resurrection, a strange sense Of absence unexplained till morning light. And whilst her memory in its crystal urn Gleams fair as silver through the dust of years, Cold evermore where sky and ocean burn With azure fire that isle of sepulchres, 'Twixt purple passion-flower and whitest rose, Where Death a garden's summer queen appears, She sleeps‚Äîbut others live for other tears. II. Ah, her young darling is not one of those! His tale for her untold, its stormy close Rent other hearts, but stirred not her repose; Unguessed by her the strange and cheerless bed Where rests, for ever rests, his weary head; And nothing of their haunted life she knows, For whom an awful star, 'twixt wind and wave, Still hovers o'er a merciless despair, Still hovers o'er their treasure hidden there, Their treasure in a never-fathomed grave‚Äî Who dare not look, but feel the ghastly gleam, While years of silence tell them 'tis no dream‚Äî To whom across the world and waste of sea, A mute sad Shadow turns its solemn gaze, Hopeless of home‚Äî‚ÄúForget me not,‚Äù It says: ‚ÄúI am not lost, while Love remembers me.‚Äù Oh, faithful to the bidding of those eyes! Oh, faithful to the tender heart of fire! Love yearns for thee with unextinguished sighs, But knows that with her death thy memory dies; And dies with it one sacred sole desire, To gather up the scattered dust of death, To charm the long-lost phantom back to light, And that dear semblance to all time bequeath‚Äî Vain bitter prayer for bitter sweet delight! In what strange lines of beauty should I draw thee? In what sad purple dreamshine paint thee true? How should I make them see who never saw thee? How should I make them know who never knew? Beauteous, mysterious, solitary boy, Awakening slowly to the Poet's joy! Fire-fountain of young genius, showering rays Of ruby sparkle through thy dreariest days‚Äî Heart in its hardy frame of manhood, ever Kept fresh and dewy through the stony ways And dust of toil, with all its vain endeavour‚Äî Oh, pathos of the dreaming azure gaze, Mute mirror of the wonders far away, That once so witched with its unconscious blaze The stranger-artist‚Äîquenchless to this day, Like stars burnt out in ages long gone by, Whose phantoms still are splendid in the sky‚Äî So all with thee, dear love, is dark and blind; With us, the smile, the flash, the glory, stay behind! But words tell nothing‚ÄîHow tell half the rest? The fancy's quaint inventiveness of jest‚Äî Wild, beautiful caprices of a speech Now long unwritten, mute, and past from reach‚Äî The rebel spirit's free-born questionings, Past use and fashion, to the core of things‚Äî But words tell nothing. Dim, how dim, alas! My painting shows upon no magic glass. Ah, where to seek him? Many a desert place Of lovely wonders once had known him well, And pilgrim fancy follows on his trace; But, when she seems to find his missing face, And weeping prays him all his tale to tell‚Äî No word she hears save, ‚ÄúNevermore! Farewell!‚Äù Never the freezing forest, See ‚ÄúTwo Months on the Tobique.‚Äù which the grim North-easter sets a-tremble with one sigh, Through all its plumy pine-tops in the sky, Then rends with crash and uproar limb from limb‚Äî Shall shut again its cedarn gates on him, Nor whisper age-long secrets any more Around the daring, dreaming hermit's door. Oft the gold moon shall climb her midnight stair, Above drear summits of the hemlock-tree‚Äî With pale auroras decked, like streaming hair, And from her chilly throne shall seek him there‚Äî But her young lonely Poet, where is he? From his wild prison where the stealthy Death Went whispering through the trees with poniard breath, Down thy snow gallery, thou steel-bound river, Long since that poet passed away for ever. Ah, where to seek him? For no longer now In richer wilds and skied with fiercer blue, The beauteous frown of sleep upon his brow, Dreaming he lies, deep in the dawn's chill dew; No more his flocks their desert pasture roam, No more he toils, a miner in the wild; But ah! for ever, evermore exiled, For ever lost the solemn hope of home! Brave, hardy wanderer, still through loss and pain Athirst for beauty in earth, sky, and sea, For thee no glaring prize, no vulgar gain Was destined‚Äîbut sweet Nature wedded thee; And caught thee up with her to heaven's third height, And things, by man unspeakable, she told‚Äî Oh, what a soul was swept into the night! Oh, what a heart in the cold deep lies cold! What passion buried there its joy and pain! Oh, sea and storm! Oh, homeward bound in vain! Oh, home bereft, what long expectant years Closed with that darling life in hopeless tears! III. Vain broken promise of unfinished lives! From your untimely ashes what survives? Who shall fulfil your unlived half of life? Who win the crown of your unfoughten strife? Is your lost future like the dusky shade The new moon carries in her golden boat? Ah, no; for in full royalty arrayed The perfect orb through ether yet shall float; But neither light nor colour comes to thee, Faint outline of a life that shall not be! On that blank page, the student, Fancy, reads The unwrit story of what should have been, Sees, mournful paradox, the never seen, And knows what was not. Yet the grief which needs, For life's support, a faith and not a dream, Holds that the spirit in its sigh supreme With sudden flame shall interpenetrate Some form unearthly in some unknown state, A beauteous mystery of meeting bliss Reserving for the souls that weep and wait. But vainly towards that state we strain from this; The earthly heart, the face, the self we miss, 'Tis that which was we fain would re-create. We talk in earth's old language to our lost, With our own sighs revivify its ghost: The form Love meets advancing through the gloom, Is but the reflex of her own desire, Flashed on the glass, as in a darkening room We meet ourselves.‚ÄîLove once within the tomb, Shall not that reflex of herself expire? Can any form our thought may fashion here Have life beyond this bounding atmosphere? Yet, long-lost sister! can a soul like thine Drop from the march of Nature's foremost line So early, so unmissed? Can all her pride In that rich promise be so cast aside? Oh, long-lost brother! Shall the myriad years Make plain to Man this mystery of tears? Shall light come ever to this blind sad Earth That knows not what is death nor what is birth? It will, but not to me. Earth yet shall know, By a new light, the secret of her past, Shall ask no more, ‚ÄúWhy do I suffer so?‚Äù But smile in one great harmony at last. And we, with faith in what we shall not see, May call the dead whose tomb is in our heart, To rise and take their own unconscious part Of service in the glory that shall be. For, could we link their memories to the chain Of souls whose lights in long procession move From Past to Future, so might yearning love Behold their buried beauty live again, To glide with solemn purifying glow Along the endless way the ages go; Might joy o'er something added‚Äîcasting in Such jewels‚Äîto the world's great treasure heap; And here and there some living souls might win To reverent fellowship with souls that sleep. Oh, perfect Race to be! Oh, perfect Time! Maturity of Earth's unhappy youth! Race whose undazzled eyes shall see the truth, Made wise by all the errors of your prime! Oh, Bliss and Beauty of the ideal Day! Forget not, when your march has reached its goal, The rich and reckless waste of heart and soul You left so far behind you on your way! Forget not, Earth, when thou shalt stretch thy hands In blessing o'er thy happy sons and daughters, And lift in triumph thy maternal head, Circling the sun with music from all lands, In anthems like the noise of many waters‚Äî Forget not, Earth, thy disappointed Dead! Forget not, Earth, thy disinherited! Forget not the forgotten! Keep a strain Of divine sorrow in sweet undertone For all the dead who lived and died in vain! Imperial Future, when in countless train The generations lead thee to thy throne, Forget not the Forgotten and Unknown! L.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">MEMORIALS. POEMS BY L. THE MYSTERY OF MYSTERIES. I Of all the planets yearning‚Äîas they run In magic round still ending, still begun‚Äî To break the spell that holds them from the sun, Does any guard the secret of all things? Does some Star Emperor, other than the one To which the lark sweet adoration sings, Draw wiser worlds than ours around his throne? Or must our hope still further stretch its wings On to that Point of Mystery, unknown Magnet of all the suns whose fiery cars Whirl myriads after them of unimagined stars? II Or seek the Cause of Causes far behind, The grave-clothes of a dateless past unwind, Till nothing but an embryo's dust we find, Which knew not what we know? Say, can we reach, By footprints faint as these, the Master-mind? What though primeval atoms dumbly teach The law of change, which, ere life yet began, Gave form to formless matter,‚Äîcan they preach Of aught that's older than themselves to Man? Reveal a Presence greater than we see, Greater than all we are and all we hope to be? III Perchance, perchance at last, his toils and tears, The long death-grapple of his hopes and fears, And wisdom martyred all the countless years,‚Äî Through deepening soul and heart's enlarged embrace, And Duty owned sole star of worshippers,‚Äî Shall this day's type of half-formed man efface, (What time the wrangling Oracles are dumb) To set the crown of Godhead on our race, And work the nobler miracles to come. In vain for ages long we seek a sign Of any God on earth, till Man becomes divine. LAMENTATIONS. I. Oh, that my head were waters, And fountains were mine eyes, For all thy sons and daughters, Thou world of sins and sighs! Oh, that my heart might speak before it breaks and dies! Through Youth, through Age, through each Dead Conscience in its turn, Wisdom that will not teach, Folly that will not learn, Through man and woman too, my words should pierce and burn. Alas for Youth! because The heart of Youth is old; It thrills not for a cause, But, arrogantly cold, Turns from the fiery summons as a tale twice told. The holy dangerous ray It shuns, to join the press That throngs the gaslit way Of bare and hard success, And sinks at last, unmissed, to night and nothingness. Oh, thou that wouldst not soar, Methinks 'twere nobler done To rise, as rose of yore Resplendent Phaethon, And fall‚Äîbut fall, like him, a rival of the sun! And if I sigh for Age Because it is too late, Because it has grown sage, But cannot mend its fate, And knows not what Life is till Death is at the gate, Still more for Age I mourn Because it is afraid, With all its vows forsworn, The world's great cause to aid, And thinks man will not change, but be as he was made. And Love‚Äîman's doom and jest‚Äî What hast thou here to do? In such disguises dressed, We know not false from true; We trust the world to thee, and thou betrayst it too. Love frivolous and vain, Love coldly overwise, Love sensual and profane, And worshipper of lies‚Äî Traitor, depart from us! True love, awake, arise! II. For Woman most my tears Should set Man's heart on fire, Whose love and threats and jeers Have made of her a liar, That paints her very soul, to win the world's desire. Oh, Earth! Earth! Mother Earth! Rise, call upon thy son!‚Äî ‚ÄúI bare twain at a birth, And thee, the stronger one‚Äî With her I gave to thee, tell me what hast thou done? ‚ÄúWhen, fresh from Nature's arms, She first clasped hands with thee, Her noble infant charms Announced a queen to be, Wise, beautiful, and pure, and brave as are the free. ‚ÄúThou madst this queen thy slave, In falsehood, fear, and shame; The best her mother gave Was counted her for blame, And Fame suborned to make a by-word of her name. ‚ÄúReared up to toil by blows, Her childhood pined in fears, Until, at last, a rose Of beauty, as the years Went forward, smiled upon the cruel world through tears. ‚ÄúThen, crowned and chained and scorned, When first her head she raised, A strange new lustre warned Her master, as he gazed, That in her eyes a spirit waked and watched, amazed; ‚ÄúAgainst its bars to beat, With plumage blood-besprent, Then flutter to his feet, A guiltless penitent, And kneel to him for pardon, praise, and punishment. ‚ÄúRebellious and reviled, Or crouching and caressed, A goddess or a child, But still a slave confessed, Caged in the jealous East, toy-sceptred in the West; ‚ÄúAlike the tale hath been To-day and long of yore; The dazzling Eastern queen, Bending her lord before, With rubies all a-tremble, and forehead to the floor, ‚ÄúStill mirrors in old story My nobler daughter, taught To bow down all her glory Of free-born will and thought Before a spectral terror, conjured out of nought. ‚ÄúThou claim'st to be her god, To rule her inmost shrine Of conscience with thy rod; Thy mockery is her sign From Heaven that she hath sinned‚Äîagainst thy laws divine. ‚ÄúBut what of Her that fell To shameless shame for thee? Hark! from that hidden Hell Her cry has risen to me,‚Äî How long, oh deaf and blind, how long shall these things be? ‚ÄúHer soul, that sobs away, Still, still a wasted breath, Her heart, that day by day Bleeds bitterly to death, While writhing that gay mask of dauntless sin beneath. ‚ÄúNo more, no more for Her Let Earth cry out in vain; My depths are all astir, And every pulse is pain,‚Äî Rise up, a nobler Brother, loose thy Sister's chain!‚Äù A REQUIEM. On reading some verses about a poor woman seen carrying the coffin of her infant in her arms to the burial. So too, dead darlings of the past By disappointed souls are borne Beneath a sky not less forlorn, Across as desolate a waste. To no triumphant requiem, Some love or faith or fancied-crown Of genius we at last lay down, And in deep silence bury them. Perhaps for years we watched them die, Perhaps they died before we knew; Perhaps a violet or two May yet spring up from where they lie. Ah! some have laid their dead in earth Where gardens redden o'er with bloom, To flower from many a magic tomb Into some new and lovelier birth. There the first passion of the boy, Buried with all its beauteous folly, Sublimes to true love's melancholy, Or true love's vivifying joy. There rise the nobler dreams of youth, From childhood's fancies cast aside; Beliefs that had their day and died Grow thence to grander forms of truth. But they who drop by slow degrees, Gifted in vain, the best they have Deep in a cold and barren grave‚Äî What shall we say to comfort these? That happier selves shall gather flowers From hopes we sowed in ground that seemed So barren?‚Äîfairy tales we dreamed Be true of other lives than ours? That poems and that pictures, pent Once in our souls, shall yet escape, And in some new transcendant shape Attain their full accomplishment? Pray for all souls that mourn their dead‚Äî Pray for all souls that they may see A light from the great time to be Already streak the East with red. Behind whose twilight wait unseen A perfect earth, perfected man, To finish all that we began, To be what we would fain have been. POEMS BY A. ‚ÄúIN MEMORIAM.‚Äù Priest, opening sacred cedar doors That shrine in dusk a perfect grief, My secret finds its twin in yours, And in that twinness its relief. For Sorrow, in her mirror here, Now first perceives, self-gazing thus, As doth a star in water clear, Her form, though sad, how luminous. I thank you‚Äîlove and loss I've felt, As you, and never word would come; Till your sweet wand its magic dealt, I thought this child of tears was dumb. Once home through winding ways went we; Warm winds breathed through soft gloom, and night Lay a dark balmy mystery, Rifting thin clouds for tremulous light. Your book, just bought, was at my home; I opened it, and read and read, Till Night had arched her midway dome, And her noon-stars were overhead. When down I lay, in darkness drowned, Out of your song my fancy drew Webs of weird music; round and round The wizard words self-chasing flew. Whirled breathless after them, I strike These lines from out my panting brain; And joy and grief seem all alike, There's such delirium in the strain. Yet, should I tell you how I caught From you these melodies of tears, I must lead back my faltering thought Over a long dusk bridge of years. An ‚ÄúIn Memoriam‚Äù in our hearts, A marble tablet, ever dwells, For ever dust to dust departs, For ever ring our funeral bells. And one sweet ghost‚Äîa love and fear‚Äî Haunts, in the thicket's wild rose isles, The soft green outburst of the year With voiceless words and wordless smiles. In my dim silvery dawn of youth I saw a sister laid to sleep Amid geraniums of the south‚Äî Oh, can one think and cease to weep? She was so young! and yet in her Death took a too consummate flower; But it decayed not‚Äîand I err, Mourning her void nook in our bower. Too full of sky-born graces was That lily life to pine in clay; Like perfume in a fairy-vase Her sweet soul burnt itself away. I will not speak, I will but think, Of after-steps in walks of pain, Walks marked by diamonds, link by link, Dropped from our happy household chain. Nor will I speak nor think of pangs That must be fled from, lest we craze; You know the huge dumb cloud that hangs, Death-dark, o'er our most azure days. You know the wants, the doubts that lie Wedged in the deep white core of thought, The yearnings stirred we know not why, That cry out for we know not what; When, 'mid dusk morn, as in a grave We wake with consciousness aghast,‚Äî The heart that like a hollow cave Echoes with voices from the past. You know it, and you know the art That can life's rugged passes smooth; That, speaking for each voiceless heart, Sets words that grieve to notes that soothe. You lead us to the mountain-top Where the great God who formed our kind Sees, nor condemns, the tears that drop From spirits bounded and half-blind. He knows, who made us quick with love, That love must shrink, while walled in clay, At those sharp blows the walls that move And strike the soul out to the day. Oh, tenderest heart! oh, truest friend! If thou art sad, as fond and true, The God that did such sadness send Send thee all comfort with it too. Thus did the heart you kindled write, Unknowing Love had oped for you A sudden blossom of delight, And brought my mystic wishes true. If in your joy's deep psalm allowed, Half notes akin to sorrow falter, All thoughts will mingle to a cloud Of incense on the marriage-altar. Nor think your friend from yon sky-land Scorns your return to earthly ways; With blessing eyes he sees you stand A candidate for richer days; Sees in your heart, where seemed a void, Love's inmost reddest leaf uncurl, Long shut in grief, but not destroyed, Just gleaming with a quiet pearl. Love on! and twine all lost desires About this central shaft of Hope; Love's fairy round, whence Ill retires For all the gentle sprites has scope. ‚ÄúYOUNG BOATMAN!‚Äù Young Boatman! still, as oft I've done, I see thy strenuous form; the sun Turns to gold threads thy brown-waved hair; Thy cheek blooms deeper in the air. With open throat, in boyish pride, On swelling lake and stormy tide, Thy brave young vigour plies the oar‚Äî The dream is gone, 'tis thou no more. Young Mountaineer! in Highland plaid Scaling Helvellyn, undismayed By winter snows, for very love Of the cold glories throned above! Young Shepherd! joying in the free And thrilling life so meet for thee‚Äî Thou watchest now, poor exile, deep In far Australia, o'er thy sheep. Young Poet! to impulsive rhyme Sparkling at touch of the sublime; Young Dreamer! with thy heart so oft Mourning o'er thoughts too wild and soft; And now in night's still visions turning Toward thy lost home‚Äîsweet, bitter yearning! Whate'er thy task, where'er thou art, Thou liv'st, the darling of my heart! THE STORY OF WOMAN. A peerless, piteous thing, Through every age and clime Tracked by her radiant wing, Yet leaving on all time Only a cry of grief, only a stain of crime! Jewelled in Eastern lands, And painted with strange lures; Carved goddess by Greek hands; Sung round by Troubadours; Still is her doom the same, this slave and toy of yours! A Dalila, a Circe, A Venus from the sea, Loved‚Äîwithout faith or mercy, A Saint‚Äîyet scorned is she; Idol and Priestess both, yet never friend nor free! False tales of her ye weave, To make your scorning good, And lo! the concrete Eve Is abstract Womanhood; And pilloried with her one half the race hath stood. Yet since, like Man, she's tasted The knowledge-bearing fruit, The life and strength long wasted That spring from that deep root Now look and speak through her, no longer blind and mute. Wide is the world, and scant Her plot marked out by you; She asks no royal grant, For she is free-born too: Give her her human rights, and see what she can do! DEJECTION AND HOPE. We, unlike children of one mother, Began our climbing with each other, I and my gold-locked, star-eyed brother. Slow climbed I step by step, while Hope, With one light bound, an antelope, Sprang past me up the mountain slope. A grey-haired toiler, I attain A half-way height, content, for pain And weariness, with little gain. I see, as when I first began, High up in heaven,‚Äîa shining span,‚Äî Aerial cities strange to man. They drew me on through wastes forlorn, Seeking the gateways of the morn, From those green dells where I was born. They drew me on without a sigh, Till all was desert round mine eye,‚Äî Those glorious cities of the sky. I ne'er shall reach their dazzling spires, Yet, stilled at last all vain desires, I sit and gaze while daylight tires. Yon winged soarer, where is he? Look where deep down a chasm you see Yawn like a hell-mouth dismally. At sunset, when the eaglet brood From their rock-turret screaming viewed A shade across the light intrude, Swift as he clomb he fell, and lies, With shattered bones, a sacrifice To the black cavern-deities. There comes the prowling wolf, Despair, At twilight for his wonted fare‚Äî How many hopes hath he found there! SONNETS TO TWO OF THE DEAD. I.‚ÄîTo Mazzini just out of Prison. Oh, never nobler, more beloved than now! The land thy whole life died for lives secure, Free, crowned‚Äîand thou must stand aloof, obscure, Far off, as one his dearest disavow‚Äî Thy land, but not thy holy dream; for thou Hadst shrined thy Italy in skies too pure, Too nobly free had planned her, to endure Triumphs of statecraft branded on her brow. And so, the vulgar hero takes a crown; Pale comes the martyr-saint from prison-blight; Oh, prophet-glance, be higher, further winged! Though now in darkness that life-star go down, Look where it rises‚Äîthe brute sword unkinged‚Äî O'er all the days to come an orb of light. II.‚ÄîTo John Stuart Mill. Oh, noble and beloved and lost! how dim One moment makes the world, glowed through e'en now With fire from thy great heart. Yet must we vow, In this dark temple of our grief, a hymn Of worship in high strivings, must o'erbrim Our lives from thy deep fount of wisdom, thou Priest of a wondrous war, with tranquil brow, Single against the world's leagued Anakim. Strong champion of the weak! what arms were thine‚Äî Reason sublime, red-hot with passion pure; If taught by thee, we pierce, aspire, endure, So art thou fighting still‚Äîyet how to bear The divine triumph of some cause divine Thou wilt have won for us‚Äîwho art not there! TWO DIRGES. I. ‚ÄúBianca, Bella, Buona, Beata.‚Äù From an inscription on a tomb. (Set to the Tune ‚ÄúFarewell Manchester.‚Äù) Blanche the beautiful, Blanche the good and blest, Under the cypress trees Lies far off at rest. Oh, the weary years! Oh, the bitter tears! For Blanche the beautiful, The good and blest. When Italian night Falls on her white tomb, And in starry dance Fireflies thread the gloom, Over land and sea Back she comes to me, Me drearily asleep In my sad room. Smiling, speaking low, Tenderly carest, Through the house she glides, Like a sweet new guest. But I wake in pain, And she dies again, Blanche the beautiful, The good and blest. L. II. ‚ÄúBeneath the Cypress' Gloomy Shade.‚Äù These lines were written by her who is the subject of the first poem in the book, ‚ÄúElegies.‚Äù Beneath the cypress' gloomy shade, Deep in a still and leafy glade, In peace my grey-haired sire is laid, To wake on earth no more. None knows save I his quiet tomb; Each morn with saddened heart I come, And gaze upon his narrow home, Till grief's full cup runs o'er. E.</field>
