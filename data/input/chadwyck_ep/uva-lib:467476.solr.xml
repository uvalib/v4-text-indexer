      <field name="fulltext">SABLE AND PURPLE MAY 1910 I I sing not Death. Death is too great a thing For me to dare to sing. I chant the human goodness, human worth, Which are not lost, but sweeten still the Earth; The things that flee not with the upyielded breath, But, housed in sanctuary of simple hearts, Live undethroned when Death Comes to the chamber of a mighty King, And sheds abroad the silence of his wing, Then shakes his raven plumage, and departs. II Honour the happy dead with sober praise, Who living would have scorned the fulsome phrase, Meet for the languorous Orient's jewelled ear. This was the English King, that loved the English ways: A man not too remote, or too august, For other mortal children of the dust To know and to draw near. Born with a nature that demanded joy, He took full draughts of life, nor did the vintage cloy; But when she passed from vision, who so long Had sat aloftâaloneâ On the steep heights of an Imperial throne, Then rose he large and strong, Then spake his voice with new and grander tone, Then, called to rule the State Which he had only served, He saw clear Duty plain, nor from that highway swerved, And, unappalled by his majestic fate, Pretended not to greatness, yet was great. III Sea-lover, and sea-rover, throned henceforth Amid the paths and passes of the sea; You that have sailed, out of our stormy North, And have not sailed in vain, To all the golden shores where now You reign, Through every ocean gate whereof You keep the key: O may your power and your dominion stand Fixt on what things soever make Life fair, And on what things soever make men free, In duteous love of ordered liberty: So shall your praise be blown from strand to strand. Your Father lies among the Kings his kin, Pillowed on yonder couch of silence, where No wandering echo of the world's loud blare Profanes the awesome air. The age that bore us is entombÃ¨d there! With You the younger time is eager to begin. Let nations see, beneath your prospering hand, An Empire mighty in arms, its fleets and hosts Keeping far vigil round your hundred coastsâ An Empire mighty in arms, but therewithal Nourished in mind, with noble thoughts made rich, And panoplied in knowledge, lacking which The proudest fortress is but feebly manned And ever trembles to its thunderous fall. And now to Youâto Her who at your side Henceforward shall divide The all but dreadful glory of a crownâ Be honour and felicity and renown! And may the inscrutable years, That claim from every man their toll of tears, Weave for your brows a wreath that shall not fadeâ A chaplet and a crown divinely made Out of your people's love, your people's trust; For wanting these all else were but as dust In that great balance wherein Kings are weighed. KING ALFRED Alfred the Great, in his Palace at Winchester, drawing near to his last days, talks with Asser the Welshman. ALFRED Asser, good bishop and well-proven friend, Thou find'st me changed and stricken low by mine Infirmities; not much of warrior left; Here feebly sitting, pierced with many nails Of pain. And in my flesh there is a voice That telleth me my days henceforth are few. ASSER Thou art not old. ALFRED No son of Ethelwulf Grows old. Nor have I held it to be aught A King should murmur at, if life burn down Untimely, whether amid toilful peace Or shaken with the blast and peal of war. But to go hence, unsure if what I wrought And moulded be more lasting than the abode Yon swallow builds, out of a little clay, And lines with feathers! ASSER King, thou hast set good trees In a good soil, where now with fruit they bless Thy plantingâ ALFRED And anon there shall return The Northern storm that I have stayed awhile, And shatter my young woods, ev'n as the old. ASSER Think not so ill of ages yet to be! The wicked may again wax proud, but men's Devices stand not, against God's resolves; And that which He hath helped the just to build, Surely He will not help the unjust to raze. Leave now to Him the Shall-be: the Hath-been, Behold it comely to look back uponâ A tale of enemies mightily withstood, And dangers greatly wrestled with and thrown; A tale told at the hearth on winter eves, And dear to earl and churl and thane and thrall For ever. ALFRED Friend, I thank thee for thy word. It may be that my thoughts are not more hale Than this worn body. And most unmeet it were, If I, that have from God riches and power, Gave not at last, unto my Over-King, Aught but a joyless heart. Nay, go not yet. Here sit thou, where this window looketh out Upon the quiet world in which I end, Who lacked not stir of camps and din of arms. Yonder my city twinkles in the sun, Beneath the down: ev'n she whom those dim minds In shining mail, the heathen Kings, did lay In ashes,âthere she riseth, and the light Gildeth her towers. And here we have satâhow oft!â And talked of happy or of woful things That have befall'n my people. ASSER But to-day, Shall we not rather count the woful things As tares and darnel sown among the wheat,â Nay, as the ills that being outlived are good,â And talk henceforth of happy things alone? Such as that famous pleasantry of thine, When Hasting with his ships lay in the Lea, And thou did'st lure the stream out of his courseâ ALFRED Out of his ancient bed! ASSER His well-loved bed! ALFRED And brought him through strange byways to the Thamesâ ASSER And left the Northman's navy high and dry. ALFRED Yea, bishop, 'twas a goodly jest. But Thought Needeth no spur to bid him carry me Far unto rearward of the time whereof Thou speakest; and when sleep is rife with dreams, Oft in old warfare am I tossed anew. Then shapes come wandering from my battlefields, And ruthless Kings sail out of Heathendom, Whose keels were the swift ploughshares of the sea, Who tilled not earth, save with the harrow of war. Again the Dane meets me in truce, again Swears on his arms, and on the holy ring Makes covenant, pledging him to go in peace From out my realm that he so sore had bruised, And I again am fooled and he forsworn. And now I lurk in thickets, fade from sight In the rank steaming marsh, am lost to men Amid the tusks and antlers of the brake, A hunted hunter, nameless, on the isle Of hiding; and there cometh thither,âborne, It well might seem, on some lone heron's wing,â Word of the gladsome slaying of Ubba, amidst His hungry sea-wolves, nigh the hungry sea That clangs on northern Devon; and there falls Into our hands that thing of sorcery, made In likeness of their fabled Odin's bird, The Raven War-flag, woven to the sound Of old enchantments in one Christless noon By the three daughters born to Lodbrok, him Of thrice dread name and doom, whom snakes devoured. Yea, and at times, swept in a hurtling dream, Again I smite the host at Ethandune, And drive them flying before me to their hold, With crash of battle-axe through scalp and skull, And hewing of great limbs as boughs lopped off When thunder hurls him on the cringing weald. ASSER Too much the memory stirs thy frame. ALFRED And yet The Northman's joy in battle for battle's sake Was never mine! Nor was I of that stuff The tamers and subduers of the earth Are made of. I had turned with a sick soul From their red havoc; from things and deeds whereat Warriors like Alexander when he trode On Persia, boasting him begotten of Jove,â Or Gensericâor the great Hamilcar's sonsâ Or Shalmaneser and Sargon in their pride,â Would with a smile have gazed: the sack of towns; The spear thrust through the tender breast of babes; And deeds I name not, but which they that sailed Against meâas the gleeman singeth it, Over the gannet's bath and whale's domainâ Held lighter than the moulted feather a gull Gives to the wind, and as the things of nought That in their sum were glory and conqueror's fame. I ever looked beyond the sword-mown field To other harvest. For in this my realm, Which I but hold in fief and vassalage From One more mighty, of more ancient throne, A King's most King-like, most King-worthy toil Begins, not ends, when he hath builded him A bulwark 'gainst his foes. Then comes the task Of rearing for his people such a house That they within, for fiery love of it, Shall leap as a lion if enemy threat their door. And being athirst to see this realm of mine, This house and mansion that my hands have reared, Full of fair things, I sent to richer lands For what mine own was poor in, bearing thence Much honourable booty, and chief of all, Their wisdom, as set forth in script and scroll; With divers other noble spoils of peace. For I did grieve to think how these rough coasts, That all too often have let in the foe, Should be so apt at keeping out the friend, Him that hath gifts for us, right worthy word And highborn thought; or skill to raise aloft Minsters that usher into heaven the mind; Or music, of such sort that while it peals In a man's breast, no baseness there can live. And greatly had it pleased me to have seen My people hotter in the love of song, And of that sweetest craft of song-making; For they are come of them that dearly prized The word of the skilled makers, those old chants Our pagan fathers graved in runes, on what They in their darkness held the sacred beech. Perhaps another age shall more abound In song-fruit, when perhaps another King Shall have less lust of it than I. Howbeit, I leave my people not unfed in mind, Whom pinched I found, and lean; and I bequeath A land healed of her wounds: where pillage was, Is tillage, and the fruit is sweet, the flower Is fair. But pray thou that there come not back The trampler of my orchard and my field, To fill the wheel-tracks of his wain with blood. ASSER King, in my land, beyond the Severn sea, They tell of one, a soothsayer, that lived, As I conceive, betwixt that time when Rome Called hence the legions, and the days when sat Theodoric at Ravenna with his Goths; And of this sage, or wizard, whom they name Merlin, 'tis written that he prophesied Of theeââThe north wind shall against him rise, And blight his flowers, the west wind's fosterlings.â The dark word was fulfilled: the north wind came And snatched away thy blooms. Now is he stayed; Now hast thou set a bound to the north wind. Comfort thee, then, and be of a glad heart, For He is on thy side who was of old On Hezekiah's, when Sennacherib's host With thunder of chariots was come up against Judah, and by the mouth of Amoz' son The Lord spake, saying, âI will put My hook In his nostrils, and My bridle in his lips, And I will turn him back by the way he came.â [A minstrel is heard singing.] Forth unto warfare Rode they and strode they, Lordly and low-born, Etheling and hind. There, by the oakwood, Hewed they the heathen, The north wind's brood, whose Nest was the sea. There, as a reed-bed In west wind rustling, Shivered the fear-swept Hearts of the foe. Now were their wounded Weary and war-sad, Kings with their kindred From battle-stead borne. Now were their spear-men Taken and spared not: Death-sickle reaped them: Swift fell the swathes. Lagged not the ravens, Flying to flesh-fare: Blithe came the war-kites, Glad the grey wolves. Drinkless and dry-lipped Had earth been at dayspring: Slaughter-cup slaked her, Long ere the eve. ALFRED There, Asser, sang the sword. Nor is it for me, Who all my life have known no peace but such As ever listens for the step of war, To call that voice unholy. Hatred, too, And rage, are paths God leads us by, to ends We understand not. . . . But the day burns low, And the light fadeth upon turret and spire. Bidest thou here to-morrow? ASSER I depart To Sherborne, thy fair town that climbs about Its minster, where my pastoral staff now lacks The shepherd. There thy brother Ethelbert Awaiteth resurrection with the just. ALFRED There, also, lieth another of my houseâ ASSER Less worthy to have been of Egbert's seed. ALFRED His sins were great; but let him rest in peace . . . It may be we shall talk not here again. ASSER It may be. For the time is not far offâ Wherefore should I dissemble at this hour?â When from the prison of the body thou Shalt be delivered; and shalt give to earth That which from earth thou hadst; and yield to God That which thou hadst indeed from God alone. ALFRED Friend, thou didst ever serve me faithfully: So serve thou him that ruleth when I cease, Edward my son. [A strange light suffuses the chamber. Alfred sinks on his knees.] Behold, I see him great And mighty, at his feet submitted thrones . . . And after him another mightier yet . . . And then, dim forms at strife . . . beyond them, crown And crozier warring . . . and deeds of hell . . . and now Glory and power new-stablished . . . and again Blind welter, and the brood of dire misrule . . . A groaning people, a sundering realm. . . . Ah, Lord Of Heaven! in mercy show Thou me no more. IN THE MIDST OF THE SEAS To my Wife I Let them not dream that they have known the ocean Who have but seen him where his locks are spread 'Neath purple cliffs, on curving beaches golden; Who have but wandered where his spume is shed On those dear Isles where thou and I were bred, Far Britain, and far Ierne; and who there, Dallying about his porch, have but beholden The fringes of his power, and skirts of his commotion, And culled his voiceful shells, and plucked his ravelled hair. II Beloved! the life of one brief moon hath sped, No more than one brief moon, since thou and I To chilly England waved a warm good-bye. On glooming tides the great ship rode, The great ship with her great live load. The famous galleons of old Spain, The prows that were King Philip's pride, Had seemed, against her mighty side, Things of derision and disdain. Out from Mersey's flashing mouth, In a night of cloud and dolorous rain, Darkly, darkly bore she south. In a morn of rising wind and wave She rounded the isle of Old Unrest, And out into open Atlantic drave, Till all the rage of all the wild south-west Unmasked its thundering batteries 'gainst her populous breast. III Many have sung of the terrors of Storm; I will make me a song of its beauty, its graces of hue and form; A song of the loveliness gotten of Power, Born of Rage in her blackest hour, When never a wave repeats another, But each is unlike his own twin brother, Each is himself from base to crown, Himself alone as he clambers up, Himself alone as he crashes down;â When the whole sky drinks of the sea's mad cup, And the ship is thrilled to her quivering core, But amidst her pitching, amidst her rolling, Amidst the clangour and boom and roar, Is a Spirit of Beauty all-controlling! For here in the thick of the blinding weather The great waves gather themselves together, Shake out their creases, compose their folds, As if each one knew that an eye beholds. And look! there rises a shape of wonder, A moving menace, a mount of gloom, But the moment ere he breaks asunder His forehead flames into sudden bloom, A burning rapture of nameless green, That never on earth or in heaven was seen, Never but where the midmost ocean Greets and embraces the tempest in primal divine emotion. And down in a vale of the sea, between Two roaring hills, is a wide smooth space, Where the foam that blanches the ocean's face Is woven in likeness of filmiest lace, Delicate, intricate, fairy-fine, Wrought by the master of pure design, Storm, the matchless artist, and lord of colour and line. IV And what of the ship, the great brave vessel, Buffeted, howled at, patient, dumb, Built to withstand, and manned to wrestle, Fashioned to strive and to overcome? She slackens her pace, her athlete speed, Like a bird that checks his ardent pinion; She husbands her strength for the day of her need, But she thrusts right on through her salt dominion; She staggers to port, she reels to starboard, But weathers the storm and lives it down; And one chill morning beholds her harboured Under the lee of the great chill town. V New York! a city like a chessboard made, Whereon the multitudinous pawns are swayed Neither by Knight nor puissant Queen, And bow not unto Castle or King, Yet hither and thither are moved as though they obeyed, Half loath, some power half seen, Some huge, voracious, hundred-headed thing, Armed with a million tentacles, whereby He hooks and holds his victims till they die. There did we tarry, dearest! But one day There came on us a longing to go forth, No matter whither, so 'twere far away! Then from the snarl and bite of the sharp North To Florida's sweet orange-flaming shore, Through forests and savannahs vast we sped, And found a sea so fair and strange, we saidâ âWe have but dreamed of splendour heretofore.â For all the sky-line was an emerald ring Of such deep glow as baulks imagining; And all the tide within it, streak on streak, Was one extravagant revel and freak Of amber and amethyst, azure and smouldering red, With every hue that is the child of these Dancing at noon on the fantastic seas. VI So for a little while we roamed In a golden, gorgeous land o'erdomed With throbbing and impassioned skies; A palmy land of dusky faces Meek before the mastering racesâ Ebony faces and ivory teeth, And liquid, kindly, patient eyes, With laughter lurking underneath. Then we took ship and landed here In old Havana. The old year, Sinking fast, hath not yet died, And here we have spent our Christmas-tide, And once in a while can just remember It is not August, but December. And here last night (Canst thou believe That five days hence 'twill be New Year's Eve?) Here, in this Yule of flaming weather, Hotter than solstice on English heather, There broke from out the unfathomed sky Lightning such as thou and I Never beheld unsheathed in the fervour of mid-July. All night long, with many an elvish antic, Violet fire lit up the dazzled land; All this morn the weight of all the Atlantic Fell in thunder on the coral strand. Comeâfor not yet subsides the mighty roar: Comeâthe whole sea invites us to the shore. VII Ah, dear one! can it be That thou and I have eaten of that herb Whereof 'tis writ that whosoever tastes Can ne'er again his lust of wandering curb, But day and night he hastes From sea to land, and on from land to sea, With vain desires that beckon and perturb His heart unrestingly? Nay, we have roved just far enough to know That we possess too little wealth to rove, Being poor in lucre, though Exceeding rich in love. Yet travel hath taught us lessons we scarce had learned in repose; Our friends have been proven our friends, and our foes have been proven our foes. And having seen and pondered much, some visions we surrender, And return a little weary, for a little taste of ease, From tempest and from hurricane, and a land of light and splendour, And the odorous thrones of summer in the midst of the seas. Vedado, Havana, Cuba December 1909 THE THREATENED TOWERS We built them not of lath and mud, We based them not on sand. A bulwark 'gainst the fitful flood, To-day their ramparts stand. Think you we reared them long ago For others to decree Their far-resounding overthrow Into the unknown sea? We shall not pull the fabric down By rude command of those Who hold as nought this realm's renown, And vaunt themselves our foes. Nay, if we did in truth desire That what we built should fall, Were theirs the voice to bid us fire The roof, and mine the wall? Let the wild wave, that would submerge All ancient things and great, With hoarse and ineffectual surge Break on the towers of State. The ages, pondering at their toil, Welded this stone and lime, And no rash hands of haste shall foil The slow, wise thoughts of Time.</field>
