      <field name="fulltext">POEMS HOLIDAY Lithe and listen, gentlemen: Other knight of sword or pen Shall not, while the planets shine, Spend a holiday like mine:â Fate and I, we played at dice: Thrice I won and lost the main; Thrice I died the death, and thrice By my will I lived again. First, a woman broke my heart, As a careless woman can, Ere the aureoles depart From the woman and the man. Dead of love, I found a tomb Anywhere: beneath, above, Worms nor stars transpierced the gloom Of the sepulchre of love. Wine-cups were the charnel-lights; Festal songs, the funeral dole; Joyful ladies, gallant knights, Comrades of my buried soul. Tired to death of lying dead In a common sepulchre, On an Easter morn I sped Upward where the world's astir. Soon I gathered wealth and friends; Donned the livery of the hour; And atoning diverse ends Bridged the gulf to place and power. All the brilliances of Hell Crushed by me, with honeyed breath Fawned upon me till I fell, By pretenders done to death. Buried in an outland tract, Long I rotted in the mould, Though the virgin woodland lacked Nothing of the age of gold. Roses spiced the dews and damps Nightly falling of decay; Dawn and sunset lit the lamps Where entombed I deeply lay. My Companions of the Grave Were the flowers, the growing grass; Larks intoned a morning stave; Nightingales, a midnight mass. But at me, effete and dead, Did my spirit gibe and scoff: Then the gravecloth from my head, And my shroudâI shook them off! Drawing strength and subtle craft Out of ruin's husk and core, Through the earth I ran a shaft Upward to the light once more. Soon I made me wealth and friends; Donned the livery of the age; And atoning many ends Reigned as sovereign, priest, and mage. But my pomp and towering state, Puissance and supreme device Crumbled on the cast of Fateâ Fate, that plays with loaded dice. I whose arms had harried Hell Naked faced a heavenly host: Carved with countless wounds I fell, Sadly yielding up the ghost. In a burning mountain thrown (Titans such a tomb attain) Many a grisly age had flown Ere I rose and lived again. Parched and charred I lay; my cries Shook and rent the mountain-side; Lustres, decades, centuries Fled while daily there I died. But my essence and intent Ripened in the smelting fire: Flame became my element; Agony, my soul's desire. Twenty centuries of Pain, Mightier than Love or Art, Woke the meaning in my brain And the purpose of my heart. Straightway then aloft I swam Through the mountain's sulphurous sty: Not eternal death could damn Such a hardy soul as I. From the mountain's burning crest Like a god I come again, And with an immortal zest Challenge Fate to throw the main. THE LAST SONG âSongsterââsay you?ââsing!â Not a note have I! Effort cannot bring Fancy from the sky: Hark!âthe rusty string! Leave me here to die. âSongster, songster, sing! Tune your harp and try. Sing! we bid you sing Once before you die!â Withered, angry, mad, Who would list to me, Since my singing sad Troubled earth and sea When my heart was glad And my fancy free? âSad or joyful, sing! Look about, above! Trust the world and sing Once again of love!â Love? I know the word: Love is of the rose. Have you seen or heard Love among the snows? Yet my heart is stirred! Nay, my fancy glows! âSummon all your powers; Sing of joy or woeâ Love among the flowers, Love amidst the snow.â Death is but a trance: Life, but now begun! Welcome change and chance: Though my days are done, Let the planets dance Lightly round the sun! Morn and evening clasp Earth with loving handsâ In a ruddy grasp All the pleasant lands! Now I hear the deep Bourdon of the bee, Like a sound asleep Wandering o'er the lea; While the song-birds keep Urging nature's plea. Hark! the violets pray Swooning in the sun! Hush! the roses say Love and death are one! Loud my dying rhyme Like a trumpet rings; Love in death sublime Soars on sovran wings, While the world and time Fade like shadowy things. âLove upon his lip Hovers loath to part; Death's benignant grip Fastens on his heart.â Look, a victor hies Bloody from the fight, And a woman's eyes Greet him in the nightâ Softly from the skies Like sidereal light! âLove is all in all, Life and death are great. Bring a purple pall; Bury him in state.â A RUNNABLE STAG When the pods went pop on the broom, green broom, And apples began to be golden-skinned, We harboured a stag in the Priory coomb, And we feathered his trail up-wind, up-wind, We feathered his trail up-windâ A stag of warrant, a stag, a stag, A runnable stag, a kingly crop, Brow, bay and tray and three on top, A stag, a runnable stag. Then the huntsman's horn rang yap, yap, yap, And âForwardsâ we heard the harbourer shout; But 'twas only a brocket that broke a gap In the beechen underwood, driven out, From the underwood antlered out By warrant and might of the stag, the stag, The runnable stag, whose lordly mind Was bent on sleep, though beamed and tined He stood, a runnable stag. So we tufted the covert till afternoon With Tinkerman's Pup and Bell-of-the-North; And hunters were sulky and hounds out of tune Before we tufted the right stag forth, Before we tufted him forth, The stag of warrant, the wily stag, The runnable stag with his kingly crop, Brow, bay and tray and three on top, The royal and runnable stag. It was Bell-of-the-North and Tinkerman's Pup That stuck to the scent till the copse was drawn. âTally ho! tally ho!â and the hunt was up, The tufters whipped and the pack laid on, The resolute pack laid on, And the stag of warrant away at last, The runnable stag, the same, the same, His hoofs on fire, his horns like flame, A stag, a runnable stag. âLet your gelding be: if you check or chide He stumbles at once and you're out of the hunt; For three hundred gentlemen, able to ride, On hunters accustomed to bear the brunt, Accustomed to bear the brunt, Are after the runnable stag, the stag, The runnable stag with his kingly crop, Brow, bay and tray and three on top, The right, the runnable stag.â By perilous paths in coomb and dell, The heather, the rocks, and the river-bed, The pace grew hot, for the scent lay well, And a runnable stag goes right ahead, The quarry went right aheadâ Ahead, ahead, and fast and far; His antlered crest, his cloven hoof, Brow, bay and tray and three aloof, The stag, the runnable stag. For a matter of twenty miles and more, By the densest hedge and the highest wall, Through herds of bullocks he baffled the lore Of harbourer, huntsman, hounds and all, Of harbourer hounds and allâ The stag of warrant, the wily stag, For twenty miles, and five and five, He ran, and he never was caught alive, This stag, this runnable stag. When he turned at bay in the leafy gloom, In the emerald gloom where the brook ran deep, He heard in the distance the rollers boom, And he saw in a vision of peaceful sleep, In a wonderful vision of sleep, A stag of warrant, a stag, a stag, A runnable stag in a jewelled bed, Under the sheltering ocean dead, A stag, a runnable stag. So a fateful hope lit up his eye, And he opened his nostrils wide again, And he tossed his branching antlers high As he headed the hunt down the Charlock glen, As he raced down the echoing glen For five miles more, the stag, the stag, For twenty miles, and five and five, Not to be caught now, dead or alive, The stag, the runnable stag. Three hundred gentlemen, able to ride, Three hundred horses as gallant and free, Beheld him escape on the evening tide, Far out till he sank in the Severn Sea, Till he sank in the depths of the seaâ The stag, the buoyant stag, the stag That slept at last in a jewelled bed Under the sheltering ocean spread, The stag, the runnable stag. MERRY ENGLAND Island-Kingdom, our island-state, Merry England, where fancy dwells In pageant, pilgrimage, high debate, And sprightly music of morris-bells; Tourneys for love and battles for hate; Torches, garlands, exultant bellsâ Challenging trumpets and festal bells; Wars of the Roses, land-locked strife, World-wide wars with France and Spain: The colour and pulse of that gallant lifeâ Shall we never recover the mood again? Rhythmic deeds, melodious words:â Merry England, the heart of mirth:â Songs of lovers and songs of birds; A bell for death and a bell for birthâ Jubilant fifths and sombre thirds: Pessimist? Optimist?âdeath and birth! Englishmen only on English earth! Confident daring, travail and strife, Battle and storm on the Spanish Mainâ How shall the fancy that donned that life Be decked and renewed with such pride again? England's fancy shall live againâ Merry England across the seas!â Jewelled with isles of the Spanish Main, Gifts of the opulent destinies: England's heart and England's brain, Throbbing and thinking in many seas Belov'd of the opulent destinies. Bluebird, oriole, bobolink, Hark to them, hear them how they sing, Where England's Canadians work and think, Woo and wed in the throng of Spring! Axes ring on the mountain-sidesâ England's gain from England's loos!â Lonely at night the ranchman rides, Humming a tune to the Southern Cross; Argosies on Austral tides, From Charles's Wain to the Southern Cross, Barter the Plough for the Southern Cross! Lord! how the English hew their way, Courage and fortune leading the van! Round the world with the break of day, Room for him, room for the Englishman! Saxon, Norman, Dansker, Celtâ Merry England, mother of mirth!â Gird the earth with an English belt, Englishmen all to the ends of the earth! Gold and grain on Rand and Veldt, Orchards, harvests over the earthâ Liners and merchantmen round the earth; Power from East to Western Ind, Power and pomp on the Indian Main, And wonder with every whispering wind To dip our dreams in the dew again. England, decked and dowered by fateâ Room for England, so please you room! Sea-Kings' realm, our Ocean-state, Woven upon the world's wide loom; Dyed and tried in high debate, And ever renewed on the world's wide loom, With weaving fleets in a world-wide loomâ Warp and woof of the sea's wide loom: Shall garnish fancy in every land With rhythmic deed and delight againâ Merry England from strand to strand, From the Spanish Main to the Indian Main. LABURNUM AND LILAC Where the New River strays, Eddying in olive green And chrysophrase, And briefly seen In traffic-troubled ways, Laburnum showers Its verdant gold, Its clustered flowers Instilled and scrolled With emerald sap: Green-tinted gold In April's lap Unpursed, unrolled; A mint of flowers, A hoard untold, Laburnine showers Of greenish gold. Like ostrich plumes The jolly donahs wear, Light-tressed or dark, The lilac blooms In every park and square And blooms in Finsbury Park; Or heliotrope or mauve, Snowy or dark, The lilac blooms In white and purple plumes. âWhat? Russell Square!â There's lilac there! And Torrington And Woburn Square Intrepid don The season's wear. In Gordon Square and Euston Squareâ There's lilac, there's laburnum there! In green and gold and lavender Queen Square and Bedford Square, All Bloomsbury and all Soho With every sunbeam gayer grow, Greener grow and gayer. The lindens in the Mall Resound with bees; The plane-trees shed their barkâ The eager trees That promptly grow so tall; And in St. James's Park Full-throated chant The song-thrush and the merle Till dusk forbids, And dim-eyed night encamps Where now the chestnuts vaunt Their leafy pyramids And lustrous lamps Of ruby, gold, and pearl; But in St. James's shade Of elms antique, The mystic porch Of Nature's bridal-room That coupled songsters seek, The lilac swings a censer Of ravishing perfume, And rich laburnums braid The green-gilt gloom With flame intenser Than the chestnut's torch. APPLE-TREES When autumn stains and dapples The diverse land, Thickly studded with apples The apple-trees stand. Their mystery none discovers, So none can tellâ Not the most passionate lovers Of garth and fell; For the silent sunlight weaves The orchard spell, Bough, bole, and root, Mysterious, hung with leaves, Embossed with fruit. Though merle and throstle were loud, Silent their passion in spring, A blush of blossom wild-scented; And now when no song-birds sing, They are heavy with apples and proud And supremely contentedâ All fertile and green and sappy, No wish denied, Exceedingly quiet and happy And satisfied! No jealousy, anger, or fashion Of strife Perturbs in their stations The apple-trees. Life Is an effortless passion, Fruit, bough, and stem, A beautiful patience For them. Frost of the harvest-moon Changes their sap to wine; Ruddy and golden soon Their clustered orbs will shine, By favour Of many a wind, Of morn and noon and night, Fulfilled from core to rind With savour Of all delight. NOVEMBER I Regent's Park Poplars, ashes, flaunting wreaths of June Green among the tarnished oaks, outstayed Lindens, plane-trees, chestnuts, elms so soon Ragged, draggle-tailed, or stripped and flayed. Somnolent canal and urban wold, Lawn and lake with saffron leaves and red, Crimson leaves and olive, brown and gold, Bronze and topaz leaves engarlanded, Underneath the feet of winter flungâ Cloth of Bagdad richer than the stuff Woven in Tyrian looms, by poets sung Barbarous when the world was young enough Frankly to adore a purple stainâ Graced the season mantled in its breath Glittering pale, or draped in swarthy rain, Victor in decay and peer of death. II The Enfield Road Capitalled and coped with massive cloud, Lofty elms, a wayside colonnade, Shaft or bole erect and interboughed, Forestward, a beckoning passage made. Like a golden haze, a misty veil Diapered with sequins, foliage lined All the vista, yellow discs and frail Stalks that snapped against the chariest wind. Flapping rooks alit on blighted sheaves; Ruddy haws in ragged hedges glowed; Elfin companies of withered leaves Pattered nowhere down the sodden road. Sullen in the west across the floor Swept and garnished of the wintry plain, Sunset smouldered like a furnace-door Black and shot with cramoisie in grain. III Epping Forest Woods and coppices by tempest lashed; Pollard shockheads glaring in the rain; Jet-black underwood with crimson splashedâ Rich November, one wet crimson stain! Turf that whispered moistly to the tread; Bursts of laughter from the shuffled leaves; Pools of light in distant arbours spread; Depths of darkness under forest eaves. High above the wind the clouds at rest Emptied every vat and steeply hurled Reservoirs and floods; the wild nor'west Raked the downpour ere it reached the world; Part in wanton sport and part in ire, Flights of rain on ruddy foliage rang: Woven showers like sheets of silver fire Streamed; and all the forest rocked and sang. IV Box Hill Brilliant month by legend slandered so! Down in Surrey in the shining air Mid-November saw the woodland grow Green as summer still, and still as fair: Elms perhaps, and fragrant limes forlorn Drooped a branch, yet half I thought to hear Men and swift machines among the corn, Voices and the ringing harvest-gear. Sunset saw I from the sinuous height Box Hill rears on sombre Mulla's bank: Darker and more dark the ruby light Over Polsdon Arbour dying sank; But or ever Time's nocturnal seal Fixed the doom of day, the mid-moon's power Did in star-attended state repeal Darkness and the sentence of the hour. V London, W. Deep delight in volume, sound, and mass, Shadow, colour, movement, multitudes, Murmurs, cries, the traffic's rolling bassâ Subtle city of a thousand moods! Distance, rumour, mystery, things that count, Bravely in the memory scored and limned! Sunset, welling like a crimson fount Underneath the Marble Arch, o'erbrimm'd All the smoky west. In Oxford Street Lamps, like jewels fallen by the way While the sun upon his urban beat Bore the lofty burden of the day, Magnified their offices and grew Vital and a rosary of light, Wreathing life that gathered heart anew Hungry for the pleasure of the night. Trees of winter's nakedness aware Gleamed and disappeared like things afraid, Dryads of the terrace and the square, Silvery in the shadow and the shade. Swarthy-purple creepers draped the high Houses; leaves in elm-tree tops astir Blurred like flakes of soot the darkling sky, Lit with faded light of lavender. VI The Chilterns I remember once a glorious thing Crowned the season in my wandering time. Through the year I went from earliest Spring Hither, thither, weaving prose and rhyme, Like a gleeman of the former age. Sound and colour were my pensioners; Constant on my passionate pilgrimage Love attended me, and friends of hers, Life and Death besides. But one day, late Roaming in the Chilterns, want of will Irked me, and the impotence of Fateâ Something lacking in the World, until Bluff November in the coppice near Loud on orient horns an onset wound, While the larks that through the golden year Garlanded the air with dazzling sound, Surged upon the tempest's deafening cryâ Crests of foam about the ocean driven, Lightning scribbled on a thund'rous sky, Tongues of flame upon the top of heaven! YULETIDE Now wheel and hoof and horn In every street Stunned to its chimney-tops, In every murky streetâ Each lamp-lit gorge by traffic rent Asunder, Ravines of serried shops By business tempests tornâ In every echoing street, From early morn Till jaded night falls dead, Wheel, hoof, and horn Tumultuous thunder Beat Under A noteless firmament Of lead. When the winds list A fallen cloud Where yellow dregs of light Befouled remain, The woven gloom Of smoke and mist, The soot-entangled rain That jumbles day and night In city and town, An umber-emerald shroud Rehearsing doom, The London fog comes down. But sometimes silken beams, As bright As adamant on fire, Of the uplifted sun's august attire, With frosty fibrous light Magnetic shine On happier dreams That abrogate despair, When all the sparkling air Of smoke and sulphur shriven, Like an iced wine Fills the high cup Of heaven; For urban park and lawn, The city's scenery, Heaths, commons, dells That compass London rich In greenery, With diamond-dust of rime Empowdered, flash At dawn; And tossing bells Of stealthy hansoms chime With silvery crash In radiant ways Attuned and frozen up To concert pitchâ In resonant ways, Where wheels and hoofs inwrought, Cars, omnibuses, wains, Beat, boom, and clash Discordant fugal strains Of cymbals, trumpets, drums; While careless to arrive, The nerved pedestrian comes Exulting in the splendour overhead, And in the live Elastic ground, The pavement, tense and taut, That yields a twangling sound At every tread. ECLOGUES I THE IDES OF MARCH Percy Herbert Basil Ninian Sandy Percy Where the brimming freshets rush And the pebbles chafe and ring, The leafless alders flush With purple of the Spring. Herbert And the crimson osiers burn With spathes that swell and split, And every bract an urn With twinkling catkins lit. Basil Where chaos spreads unkempt, And formless being roves, I wandered lost Until I crossed The ultramundane groves, And dreamt last night, as CÃ¦sar dreamt, I placed my hand in Jove's. Ninian And music sighed and sang, And voices uttered doom, And Mars's armour rang Untouched in CÃ¦sar's room. Most ominous of woe, A wondering slave appeared, Whose fingers flamed belowâ Sandy A candelabrum weird! Ninian Titanic beings fought, In fiery arms on high; The Universe was wrought To tragic sympathy; Nor can the years dispel The awe of that; nor can The tongues of poets tell The deed these signs foreran, For on the morrow fell The greatest man. Basil What cry? what whispered word? Percy What music wild and sweet? Herbert The listening air is stirred. Sandy The sounds are in the street. Basil I hear a murmuring flood. Percy I hear a trembling string. Ninian The sounds are in our blood. Basil The sounds are of the Spring. Herbert The throstle in the brake, Alone, and hid away, Beginning to rehearse His long-considered lay, Because the blossoms wake On the elms, the first in flower, Repeats a broken verse And tunes it by the hour. Percy And his cousin thinks him a dunce, The blackbird, he who sings At the top of his voice at once While the startled woodland rings: He peals his splendid song Loud and fluent and clear, For echo to prolong And all the world to hear. Herbert Now like a golden gong; Now like a crystal sphere. Percy For echo to prolong And all the world to hear. Basil What sound is this that comes At sunset lowly pitched? The roll of elfin drums Or song of things bewitched? Perhaps the nightwind strums The wires, with news enriched Of peace, and silent drumsâ With happy news enriched Of silent, sleeping drums, With war no more bewitched. Ninian At least the springtime comes; For I hear in a valley I know A sound of elfin drums, And a shadowy clarion blow, As the crimson threads and thrums In the twilight sky decay, And the wandering beetle hums The threnody of day. Sandy When the spacious darkness comes, And the crimson lights decay, The ponderous beetle hums The threnody of day. Herbert The nightwind sighs and sings. Percy The darkness deepening comes. Basil The antique curfew rings To the roll of elfin drums. Ninian The flickering threads and thrums, The ruddy brands decay; And the mournful beetle hums The threnody of day. Basil But soon the wakening comes, And darkness dies forlorn; And the thunder of the drums Of the March wind ushers morn. Ninian And woes that wound the sight, And spectres disappear. Percy And men are men of might. Herbert And love is crystal-clear. Sandy And I swear by the light, And the noon and the night, It is good, it is good to be here! II ST. MARK'S EVE Basil Ninian Vivian Basil Late, Vivian! Midnight stirs In the placid bosom of Time. Vivian I have been in the wildwood, sirs, In the snare of a sovran rhyme; Where blossoms and feathers and furs Grow rich as a dazzling rhymeâ With stains of a fragrant rhyme; And the very spathes and spurs Are tuned to the deafening chime Of the larks and the courage that stirs In the heart of the vernal prime. Ninian In the wildwood? Here or beyond? At home in the world or afar? Where the bracken unfurls a frond, Or a nebula loosens a starâ Where the fern delivers a frond, Or a nebula utters a star? Vivian At home. In this hermit-nook Of conscious pleasure and pain I journeyed to listen and lookâ With wonder to listen and look In the Warren and Honey Lane, By the Quicks and the Cuckoo brook From Epping to Chingford Plain. Where the passion of Nature stirs Undisciplined, up and down I wandered the wildwood, sirs, On the margin of London townâ In the forest that's ours and hers On the threshold of London town. Ninian Did you see then the blackthorn blaze Against the empurpled glow Of the glades and the woodland ways? Did the violet forest glow Where the budded leaf delays, And chaplets pallid as snow On the twisted blackthorn blazeâ Coronals, garlands, sprays Like fresh, moon-silvered snow? Basil Did you hear from Highbeach tower The mellow quarter-chimeâ From the belfry of Highbeach tower Did you hear the music of Time, Like silken banners unfurled? From the ancient and hallowed bower Of the virginal bride of the world, Did you hear the melodious hour Like broidered banners unfurledâ With the dulcet and virginal power Of Time, the bride of the world? Vivian I saw the blackthorn blaze Like wreaths of moonlit snow, Where the budded leaf delays And the violet woodlands glow; From Highbeach steepled tower I heard the quarter-chimeâ From the ancient and hallowed bower Of the beautiful virgin, Time, I heard the melodious vesper hour And the sprightly quarter-chime. Then the blackbird finished his song On a penetrant, resolute note; Though the thrush descanted long, For he knows no tune by roteâ With sighs descanted long Of the sorrow he aches to tell; With sobs and shuddering moans, Like one that sings in Hell, He laced the phantom over-tones Of the mellow vesper-bell: Some terror he fain would tell, But he never can strike the note: So the thrush descanted long, While the blackbird finished his song. And the woodwele's laughter ceased In his ash-green gurgling throat On the fringe of the tones released By the vibrant vesper-bellâ The forest laughter ceased In the wake of the twilight bell, And high, so high, from the dusky sky The last lark breathless fell. But the nightingales sang on Like welling founts of sound, As the saffron sunset paler shone And the darkness grew profound; The nightingales sang on And the sleepless cuckoos beat Their dulcimers anon, anon, In the echoing woodland streetâ Their golden dulcimers anon In every forest street. And lo! from their secret bowers In the shadowy depths of the chace, With lanterns jewelled like flowers In state at a stately paceâ The elfin-folk from their hallowed bowers In the innermost shrine of the chace, Came, swinging their fragrant and luminous flowers, To dance in the market-placeâ Came with their dances and lanterned flowers To the forest's market-place. And I watched them dancing for hours In elfin pomp and state: I saw the elves and I watched them for hours, And therefore I come so late. Basil How say you? An April tale Of the nightingale's song and the lark's; Or a vision at best, or a dream? Ninian Nay, for enchantments prevail, And things are as strange as they seem, At the mystical Tide of St. Mark's A pregnant fantasy stirs, And prodigies happen o' nights. Vivian And I saw them, I saw them, sirsâ The elves in their woodland rites! When the vesper-bell had rung, And the last lark dropped from the sky; When the cuckoo's golden tongue, And the nightingale's rhapsody Full-filled the forest with sound, From their secret and hallowed bowers In the woodland depths profound, From the innermost heart of the chace, The elves with their lanterned flowers Trooped forth at an elfin pace; And I watched them dancing for hours In the forest's market-place. III THE TWENTY-FOURTH OF MAY Basil Ninian Brian Vivian Lionel Brian Must this be Empire-Day? Basil The date is fixed. Brian Forfend The omen, powers on high! Basil Shame, traitor, shame! Amend So treasonous a sigh. Empire and Empire-Dayâ Brian I still mistrust them, I!â Basil Have come and come to stay! Brian I hate the name, the thing! You know the prophets say, âEmpire begins the end: The loves, the hopes we sing, Our sweetest common good Will fade, their source decay, And fancy's naÃ¯ve device Unmourned depart awayâ Art and our freer mood For ever and a day.â So stiff is empire's price, The penalty of power. Ninian But the drama of the woods, That deepens every hour, No change in men can change, While the murmuring cushat broods, And the restless fern-owls range The night-winds interstrown With wonders, jewelled wings Of moths and chafersâsown With silken singing wings Of lost nocturnal things. Lionel Not fear, not love, not hate, Not shame, not wounded pride Can heighten or abate The jocund summer-tide That blossoms hour by hourâ The surf and crested tide Of the fragrant hawthorn flower. Vivian No human joy or care, Not envy, age, or pain, Not the whole world's despair Can tarnish, taint, or stain One gold-bossed silver shield Of the daisies of the fieldâ The land-wide Milky Way Of the myriad eyes of day. Brian To me the amber studs Of the kingcups on the leas, And the fragrant hawthorn buds Are but the earth's disease; And the daisies in the grass A snowy leprosy. Basil Hush, slanderer, hush! Alas, How deep your discontent! Brian Imperial thoughts for me Decolour and unscent The violet and the rose; For empire is the womb Of teeming wars and woes, The enemy of chance That keeps the world in hope, And the murderer and the tomb Of art and all romance. Basil If that's the only ill, The source of all your gloom, No longer need you mope. Such dire imperial doom Has been, and shadows still All landlocked empire, shut In one unhealthy room; A drilled mechanic state That jolts in one deep rutâ Whose grave, or soon or late, Is its habitual rut, By time and chance and fate For ever sealed and shut. Brian Infallible rebuke That shames imperial pride! Basil The doom that overtook The empires of the past; The doom that must betide All rule however fast Enfeoffed with power and law, That makes its interest, first and last, To hold the world in awe. But England's Ocean-state Enthroned upon the sea, The armed and equal mate Of power and liberty, Has this for doom and fateâ To set the peoples free. Lionel Nobler than empireâword Ill-omened, out of date!â What name shall be conferred On England's Ocean-state? Basil We need no other name; Our origin, our fate, Our history speaks, our fame, In England's Ocean-state. Vivian Wherever England comes The lowliest has his chance. Lionel Our English story sums The meaning of Romance. Basil We bid the poet drink Till Hippocrene be dry, And the thinker dare to think The sun out of the sky. Lionel We bid the dreamer, drunk With dreaming, dream again; And fakir, mollah, monk To any heaven attain. Basil Then though these isles were sunk And buried in the sea, Our England would remain Wherever men are free. Ninian Embattled usage falls At the beating of our drums; All proud originals Have scope where England comes. Vivian As free as birds that sing And serenade the morn. Lionel As the swallow on the wing, Or the blackbird on the thorn. Basil Or the throstle, purged of scorn For the music in his heartâ That takes such loving pains To school his angry heart, And now at last attains The mastery of his art. IV BAPTIST TIDE Basil Lionel Brian Menzies Basil Outcast and vagrant, hail! Unhappy, wandering star, You sojourn here, unchid; We love youâas you are, Rejected, scorned, forbid, Targe of the world's abuse. Lionel What nectar, dark or pale, To drink your happier cheer in? What brew, what auburn ale, What blood, what golden juice Of Albany or Erin? Menzies The grape, the grape: no malt To deaden soul and sense. Let some illustrious wine My heart and brain exalt, And crowded opulence Of fantasy be mine. Basil Your brain shall teem with sights Desirable as youth; And sense and soul divide The ravished world between them. Brian Bethink you, sirs: in sooth We should be Nazarites, For this is Baptist Tide. Lionel Let formalists demean them As ancient modes provide: We take no oath, no vow; Nor shall our hearts abide In bondage of the past. Basil The adolescent world Is but beginning now; And men are men at last. Brian Yet the sweet heaven unfurled About us like a rose, Nor ending, nor beginning, Nor age, nor ailment knows. Lionel Though that were certain, folk Who cannot make an end Of simple-hearted sinning, Who have their lives to spend, And must endure the yoke Of human joys and woes, Seek still a new beginning, Desire a sweeter song, Expect the compassed close Of misery and wrong. Basil A cup of wine can change Despair to deep delight. Brian An overture that jars Upon our mood! We range The purlieus of the night On thoughts that seek the stars; You drag us down to earth, And urge a vinous mirth! Basil Nay, now; fill, drink, and mark:â A Burgundy mature; RomanÃ©e Conti, dark As carmine jewels, pure As CÃ´te d'Or's golden noons, And spiced with dewy scent Of rich autumnal moons. Brian A wine whose virtue's spent Before the lees appear! Basil By Dionysius, no! A mystery slumbers here, A rite, a sacrament, Whose nature I can show. We drink material power; The inmost soul of wine Is adamant, the flower Of carbon: light and heat Long-hoarded in the mine; Mettle of bread and meat; The dawn whose crimson flood Intoxicates the east; The tissue and the heart Of organism; the blood, The seed of man and beast Become by Nature's art Sterile as candent flame, And yet the stuff, the breath Of noble strife, of fame, Of myths that folk invent To give the past a name; Ethereal life in death, Potable ravishment. Lionel The naked facts; the truth; The power, the poetry! Basil Now will our outcast see Some vision of his youth; Of summer's flower and leaf, Of emprise meetly done; A happy gleaner's sheaf, Or love, or battle won; Some joy beyond belief: For he has drunk the sun, Drunk up the night and day, Drunk down the dregs of grief, And drunk the world away. Lionel He sees us not, nor hears; A glory fills his eyes, Like one through crystal tears Beholding Paradise. Menzies Not rubies set in gold Of matchless flame and worth, But dawn and sunset scrolled About the emerald earth! Oh, moon of my desire, Bend from your heaven above, A lily sweet, on fire With newly budded love! Bend from your heaven; be mine Once more before I die, And let life's hallowed wine Empurple earth and sky In hyacinthine hours, And dusky midnights hung With stars and passion-flowers And ecstasies unsung! Lionel Entranced into the street He wanders like a shade! Brian He treads on wingÃ¨d feet: I think his grave is made! Basil His soul is bathed in light, His heart for love athirst: Were he to die to-night I scarce should call him curst. V THE FEAST OF ST. MARTHA Basil Lionel Vivian BrianBrian Perturbed by wealth, perturbed by want, With angered brain and breaking heart, Why will the world the market haunt? If folk would choose the better part!Lionel Folk must be troubled; work and think; Devote their strength; exhaust their health. I love St. Martha, meat and drink, Labour and thrift, and skill and wealth.Vivian If exorcism avail not, leave The phantom woes you sorrow for.Brian No phantoms; facts: for facts I grieve, Authentic things that dreams abhor:â Imprisoned clouds that spin and weave Complex machinery of war (Torpedoes, cannon, latent rage Impounding peace) as easily As happy playmates knit a cage Of rushes for a butterfly.Lionel And chastened lightning, pick and choice Of all man's wonder-working might, A public scribe, an airy voice, The dazzling conqueror of the night!Basil To whisper over heath and holt, To herald tidings everywhere, To travel on a thunder-bolt By land, or sea, or middle air!Vivian The docile lightning! Jupiter, Could no foreboding Proteus see Your armament celestial wear The livery of humanity!Brian Miraculous; but watch them workâ Steam, electricity: behold Iniquity and rapine lurk Where'er machinery forges gold!Basil I grant the worst: the piston-rod Undoes the handicraftsman, seals The doom of labour; clad and shod In unseen lightning, business steals The garnered wealth of rank and power, The frugal means of proud content, The widow's mite, the orphan's dower, The toiler's hard-earned increment.Lionel And thus the promise darkly given Fulfils itself: a child can tell In Rich-and-Poor and actual Heaven Deep-rooted in an actual Hell!Vivian Unhallowed jest! But let me laugh! By all the powers without a doubt The railway and the telegraph Have brought millennium about!Brian Oh, shame! That one man may be great And loll at ease, a god on high, Beneath, the castings of his fate, A myriad outworn workers sigh.Basil But how if that be just? Aha! The thing is so; therefore must be. Skilled and unskilled automata Would all escape from slavery. Whoever grasps what all esteem, What all desire, wealth, power, renown, Conceives and dares while others dream; And he who wins, deserves the crown.Brian Usurious contracts, lawless gains That fill the workhouse, stock the haunts Of vice?Basil The great world's growing pains Whose hardy soul no evil daunts!Lionel This very lightning you decryâBrian Ãme damnÃ©e by the broker's hearth! Promoter's tout, exploiter's spy!âLionel Is yet the angel of the earth. Not long shall men abuse the sons Of men; the tyrant's doom was signed When lightning learned to rouse at once The righteous wrath of all mankind.Basil The earth itself is now inspired!Vivian It knows delight, it feels distress!LionelTen thousand wires and nerves unwired Have given the globe self-consciousness!Basil Why brood and muse on sordid scenes, Why pick and point at faults and flaws? Ignore uncertain ways and means; Regard alone the final cause.Brian Who can declare why man was made?BasilThe lover knows, the children guess; War, study, pastime, toil and trade Have one sole purpose, Happiness.Vivian Only decaying types incur Remorse and moral misery! Were I a great philosopher This should my metaphysic be, A mighty Will to Happiness.Lionel Therefore it is the earth is round And speeds through Heaven, a globe express For infinite Elysium bound!Vivian Therefore the orbs that rule the year Establish seasonable times, And deck our well-appointed sphere In purfled robes of diverse climes.Lionel Love therefore sighs with fragrant breath For loftier heavens and songs unsung.BasilAnd therefore shall benignant death Maintain the world for ever young.Lionel Therefore were women made divine, With beauty, purpose, power to bless The overloaded masculine Incarnate Will to Happiness.Vivian Therefore the all-embracing sea Doth with tempestuous voice demand, âWhat power shall keep the golden key That opes the gate of every land?âBrian Therefore we torture heart and brain, And cherish neither life nor health! We tax the past, the future drainâBasil In our divine desire for wealth. We must be rich: for whom should gold Be meant if not for you and me? In every age the wise and bold Have gathered treasure ardently.Lionel A health to England's golden rose, Her affluence of material stuff!VivianA health to all the rich and those Who never can be rich enough!Basil And health to England's thrifty sons And thrifty daughters; health to all Courageous, battling, troubled ones Who keep St. Martha's Festival. VI BARTLEMAS Basil Lionel Vivian Lionel From an obsolete, festival moodâ (Ere the people grew wise and aware, Transcending the bad and the good, How extinct was the Fun of the Fair)â Out of Smithfield with vapours endued Of the rank Babylonian lair, Where Mirth and her fatherless brood Carouse it in Bartlemy Fair, I come, by the mass, by the rood, From the crusted, old Fun of the Fair! Vivian From the Forest I come whereabout The silences, harvested, throngâ Autumnal the silences throng: No throstle, no blackbird devout As the seraphim mingle their song, With perfume entangle the light And powder the woodland with pearl, Nor usher the star-stricken night With incense and melody rare; The song-thrush devout and the merle No longer enrapture the air With concord of ruby and pearl. Basil Then you of the Forest shall spin A tissue of rhythmical wordsâ Of jewelled, diaphanous words; And he shall delight in the din Of Smithfield and Bartlemas Birdsâ In the venial, carnival sin Of Bartholomew's roystering Birds; While I as a guerdon prepare In our mazer of maple that held The hydromel, quaffed at the Fair And older than scriptural eld: As wassail and guerdon supply, From a formula ancient as eld A nectar to drink of and die, In our mazer of maple, that held The hydromel quaffed at the Fair Ere the people grew wise and aware. Vivian Alack that the truth must be told! Not once now their dulcimers sweet, That haunted the Forest of old, The cuckoos, predominant, beat; Their echoing pastoral, tolled In every o'er-canopied street On dulcimers, dulcet as gold, Not now will the cuckoos repeat; Reverberant cantos unrolled, A thunder of dulcimers sweet, Through the flower-writhen Forest of old No longer the cuckoos repeat. Lionel But yesterday rose on the air, With the odour of burning entwined, The breath of an agonised prayerâ But yesterday, braiding the wind With an incense, nor holy, nor rare When they tortured the flesh and the mindâ The body as well as the mind; When the learned and the lewd had to die For the rights of the tongue and the pen, And martyrdom shrouded the sky In the smoke of the burning of men; Where now in the shouldering press Of the stareabouts destined to stare, By the booths and the stalls in the stress Of the tide and the trough of the Fairâ In the narrows and straits of the Fair, While the cressets, the torches, and links, Beginning to blossom and flare As the sun in the occident sinks With phantoms embroider the airâ While the cressets and vaporous links, As the sun that transfigured the Fair In his western brazier sinks, With witchcraft impregnate the air, Arises the mercantile cry As of souls in the depths of despairâ Of a people at home with despair, âWhat lack you and what will you buy?â The challenge and lure of the Fair! âWhat lack you, sirs? Buy, will you buy? Ripe costard or Catherine pear? Is it hey for the lust of the eye? Will you trip it, coranto or jig? But first you must eat or you die, Of a hallowed Bartholomew pigâ Of a savoury Bartlemas pig!â Then hey for the Fun of the Fair, The babel of noise and the cry, The turbulent shows in the glare Of the cressets that lacquer the skyâ That fume as they lacquer the sky! It's ho for the Fun of the Fair! And it's hey for the lust of the eye! Ripe costard and Catherine pear, And the yellow gowns fluttering byâ Green sleeves at Bartholomew Fair, And the light of a riotous eye! Basil Green leaves in the Forest; green sleevesâ I modulate Lionel's cryâ At the Fair; in the Forest, green leaves, And the glance of an innermost eye. Vivian No longer the nightingales chant To the silvery pulses of night, That echo the measure and grant Responsal of starry delight: No nightingales longer descant To the stars as they throb with delight Of the passionate answer they grant The music that troubles the nightâ As they vibrate and bloom with delight In the hanging gardens of night. For the silences, harvested, throng, Though the gold and purpureal dyeâ Though the lacquer, the mordant, and dye Of the autumn, like sounds of a song Into colour transmutable, lie On the Forestâthe crystalline tune That the spheres were imagined to play Into colour transformed in the noon Of an ever adventurous day; Above and within and about, The perfected silences throngâ In the Forest the silences throng: No throstle, no blackbird devout As the seraphim mingle their song, With perfume entangle the light And powder the woodland with pearl, Nor usher the star-stricken night With incense and melody rare; The song-thrush devout and the merle No longer enrapture the air With concord of ruby and pearl; Nor now can the nightingale sing Expecting a stellar reply; No fugues intergarlanded ring Of the earth and the clusters on highâ Sidereal echoes that bring The crystalline tears and the sigh For the end of a beautiful thing That soldered the earth and the sky. VII OUR DAY âNelson had several times said to Captain Hardy and Dr. Scott, âThe 21st will be our day.ââ âMahan's Life of Nelson. Basil Vivian Basil The chill wind whispers winter: night sets in; And now, by many a sounding thoroughfare, Life, like a tidal wave, begins to fill The theatres and halls and hidden nooks, Wherein it clangs and seethes and spends itself. Enter Lionel And whence come you? Vivian From wandering to and fro Somewhere in LondonâLondon the unknown; Which none can ever know, none ever see, But only wonder at and wander in! Basil The City of the World, ancient and proud, Vast, thronged, and awful; richer than the floor Of ocean and its unsacked treasure-house; An insolent city and a beautiful; A place of mirth and sadness infinite: Of infinite horror, infinite despair, Infinite courage and felicity. What! Do we read your thoughts, your eyes that speak Of greatnesses beheld? Lionel All day I saw A greater thing than London; now at night The ample vision looms more excellentâ The vision of a thing that shall endure When London is as Babylon; shall shine A jewel in eternal memory; Shall on the summit of achievement burn, A challenge and a beacon for the brave: The perfect battle-pageant of the deep, Trafalgar. Basil You beheld Trafalgar? Lionel Now! I watch it now! Vivian Show us this sight of sights! Make us behold Trafalgar and the pride Of England, Nelson! Lionel Look and see; who looks With insight, can! A fragile form, The delicate sheath of valour absolute; Ambition, daring, honour, constancy, Prescience, dominion, passion, scope, design, A woman's tenderness, an infant's awe, An adamantine courage, mercy, power Attuned and fateful in an invalid! Sea-lord, sea-god, his clear, transcendent love Endowed his friends with lustre of his own, And saw no blemish for excess of light Which his great spirit shed: his glittering scorn, His hate for England's sake of England's foes, Diviner than his love, at England's need O'erthrew the splendid Titan who essayed To wrest the loyal sea from English hands, Holding in trust that greatest gift of Fate. The Nile, the Baltic, saw his pregnant war; The palsied navies shrivelled at his touch; So suddenly he came, so swiftly smote, So wholly conquered, that his deeds remain The bulwark maritime of England's power. Nothing could tame his soul: that ocean-hunt About the Atlantic and about in quest Of action France and Spain denied, Whetted his lust of battle; long delay, That withers enterprise and rots desire Even of enduring things, augmented all His purpose and matured the valiant seed Of utmost victory. Wherefore upon the dawn Foreknown of battleâfor the Admiral said âThe twenty-first will be our dayââhe paced His quarter-gallery subtly clad already In the shadow of his glory; prepossessed Besides with death; and like a spirit calm That treads the threshold of eternity. Now, when the morning brimmed the western world, And on the weather-gleam a headland rose Assured of fame, and the confederate fleets Appeared between, hull crowding hull, five miles Of armament, our great sea-warrior bade The battle be. Southward the ships of France, The ships of Spain, northward the English sailed, As if they meant to pass each other by In some majestic ritual of the tide. But Nelson's signals, winged like thought aloft, Undid that minuet! Twelve sail of his, The weather line, with Collingwood to lee, Bore up amainâthe wind west by nor'-westâ And eastward stood athwart the banded fleets, That veered unwieldily and headed north With safe retreat on Cadiz, till Nelson's touch Precipitated battleâhe on their van And Collingwood against their southern flank: Two columns opportunely; yet to the end The sailing order held the battle-lineâ Our Admiral's prophecy and inspired device. That happy signal first: âEngland expects That every man will do his dutyâ; then Drums beat to quarters: gunners, stripped and girt, The naked flesh of England against the fire And rending bolt of England's foes, unlashed Their ordnance: frowning crews, equipped With linstock, priming-iron, rammer, wad, Crowbar and handspike, cartridgÃ©, wreaths of shot, Stood by each carronade, each red-lipped gun; Topman and boarder, trimmer, musketeer, Marine and powder-boy fulfilled his post, His deed, his errand, transfigured suddenly. The ceremonial wind controlled the approach, Keeping a pageant-pace; and towering sails Of England's navy, sheeted to the sky, Slumbered at ease, a dulcet, virgin sleep, So placid in their bosoms the breath of heaven Dwelt like a dream, as every vessel, groomed For war and marshalled on the vagrant surge Of coming tempest, rode to victory. France fired the nuptial gun; the flags broke out Of every nation, and the battle joined. In front of England the Royal Sovereign first Achieved the enemy's range. The Victory next, Silent against a navy's broadsides, forged Ahead; and when her double-shotted guns, One after one, at twenty feet had ploughed The Bucentaure endlong, aboard the doomed Redoubtable she ran. Forthwith amid The din of cannon against cannon, mouth To bellowing mouth, the shriek of timber crashed And rent, the thund'rous voice of men absorbed In the wild trance and waking dream of war, Carnage and agony and the rhythmic swing And travail of the deed, as Nelson paced His quarter-deck awaiting the superb, Unmatched event his genius had ordained, The fatal marksman in the enemy's top Espied his honours and England's hero fell. Down in the winepress of the war where blood O'erflowed the orlop, where the wounded strewed The noisome cockpit and the grimy sweat Cooled on the labouring surgeons, Nelson died: The swarthy smoke that coiled from poop to hold Obscured the glimmering lanterns; overhead The cannon leapt; like a taut rope the hull Quivered from stem to stern with every shot; And still above the thunder of the strife, Cresting the uproar, pealed the great hurrah Of all the English crews, as ship by ship The baffled navies struck and Nelson's name Became immortal. Vivian Such a dying deed! Basil So great a life, so great a death, so great A legacy of Empire! Lionel All are ours, And will be ours while Nelson's fame endures: Great lives, great deaths for England the sea! VIII NEW YEAR'S EVE Cyril Bertram Everard ClarenceCyril The earth reposes: bird and beast Are neutral-hued in copse and dell; The very grass-green truf has ceased To grow till Spring shall break the spell.Bertram From frozen seas the north wind blows, From sapphire icebergs rooted deep In Arctic fathoms.Everard Ancient snows About the poles renew their sleep.Cyril Old continents of snowâworld-old! How comfortable there to lie Embalmed in everlasting cold In peace and crystal purity!Clarence Let these amenities increase; But though the north be hoar with rime, Give me the vineyard's purple peace, The golden peace of harvest-time; A peace with cannon frankly girt, An armament in every sea; A peace that wears a blood-red skirt Deep-dyed in many a victory; The purity of healthy lives, Of love that sings both high and low, Of genial husbands, happy wives, Of mothers purer than the snow.Cyril Winter's a dream: the fallows feel The hope of tilth; each blossom chaste, Against the cold in Milan steel Of stout hibernacle encased, Glows with a vision of the Spring, The fragrance and the stain of June; And thrushes on a sudden sing The motive of their Summer tune.Bertram Hush! hark! St. Paul's!Everard Each vibrant thought, An orb of music, fills the ear With rich harmonics interwrought.Cyril The year is dead!Bertram Long live the year!Everard Now midnight through the city rings; A hundred reeling belfries chime, With overtones like rhythmic strings, The lofty madrigal of Time.Cyril The world speeds in a trance profound From dark abyss to dark abyss Across this twelve-arched bridge of sound Between the two eternities.Bertram Who'll give the dreaming earth a shock, Who set its torpid mind aglow?CyrilIs there an ink to etch the rock, Ethereal lye to blanch the snow? A cresset to contain the sun, A crystal cup to hold the sea, A voice to rouse the dead and done, A highway through the galaxy? Discover these, or things as strange, Then shift the earth and turn the year! Discover these, then seek to change The mood of men, the world's career!Clarence There is a dish to hold the sea, A brazier to contain the sun, A compass for the galaxy, A voice to wake the dead and done! That minister of ministers, Imagination, gathers up The undiscovered Universe Like jewels in a jasper cup. Its flame can mingle north and south; Its accent with the thunder strive; The ruddy sentence of its mouth Can make the ancient dead alive. The mart of power, the fount of will, The form and mould of every star, The source and bound of good and ill, The key of all the things that are, Imagination, new and strange In every age, can turn the year, Can shift the poles and lightly change The mood of men, the world's career.Cyril What cry is this? What mad to-do? When and by whom is this great power That melts and forges worlds anew Installed and used? The man, the hour?Clarence No other timeâwe understand Nor whence, nor whither, why nor howâ Is ever at the world's command Than this eternal present Now.Cyril You rede the riddle of the earth, The ancient rule of all who ride; And young it is as every birth, As new and fresh as time and tide:â By town and tower, through brake and briar, About the world while life shall last, Unbroken horses shod with fire The wild-eyed moments thunder past: Who grasps the flying mane and mounts, Indifferent if he fail or thrive, In happy stride with all that counts Arrives where'er the gods arrive.Clarence 'Tis not enough to mount and ride, No saddle, bridle, whip, nor spur; To take the chance of time and tide, And follow fame without demur. I want some reason with my rhyme, A fateful purpose when I ride; I want to tame the steeds of Time, To harness and command the tide: I want a whip whose braided lash Can echo like the crack of doom; I want an iron mace to smash The world and give the peoples room.Cyril We thought we knew you! Who are you That talk so loud?Clarence One who can tell That false is false and true is true, Alive or dead, in Heaven or Hell. L'ENVOI Born, enamoured, built of fact, Daily on destruction's brink Venture all to put in act Truth we trust and thought we think. Nothing has been said or done: Free from the forbidding past, Knowledge only now begun Makes an actual world at last. Powers of Earth, of Heaven, of Hell, Blent in us and tried and true, By dynamic deed and spell Forge and mould the world anew.</field>
