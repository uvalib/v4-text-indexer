      <field name="fulltext">SCOTS POEMS, &amp;c. MERRY TALES For the lang Nights of Winter. In Dialogues betwixt the Tinklarian Doctor and his Grandam, &amp;c. The Taylor cry'd, and fell into a cough, And the whole choirâdid hold their hips and laugh, And waxen in their mirth, did sneeze and swear, A merrier hour was never wasted here. Shakespeare. The winter nights in merriment and play, They pass, to drive the tedious hours away. TINKLARIAN DOCTOR. On a winter's night, my gran'am spinning, To make a web of good Scots linen; Her stool being plac'd next to the chimley; For she was auld, and saw right dimly: My lucky-dad, an honest Whig, Was telling tales of Bothwel-brig; He could not miss to mind th'attempt, For he was sitting peeling hemp. My aunt, whom nane dare say has no grace, Was reading on the Pilgrim's Progress; The meikle tasker, Davie Dallas, Was telling blads of William Wallace: My mither bade her second son say, What he'ad by heart of Davie Lindsay. Our herd, whom all folks hate that know him, Was busy hunting in his bosom, 'Till, being tir'd with twa hours scratching, He fell at length to quick dispatching; Ne'er Roman slew so many Grecians, As he did of his blood relations; Nor did he think it was a sin, To be the dead of all his kin. The bairns and oes were all within doors, The youngest of us chewing cynders, And all the auld anes telling wonders. I'll tell you mine, you ne'er heard droller, 'Tis meikle worth to be a scholar. I've seen you where you never was, And where you ne'er will be; But yet within that very place, You shall be seen by me GRANDAM. Na, that dings all; but 'tis a fiction, A plain and perfect contradiction; You'll see me where I ne'er will be, I never heard a greater lie. TINK. DOCTOR. Gran'am, look up unto the glass, And there you'll see your wrinkled face. GRANDAM. I vow, I'd rather giv'n ten dollars, Before I had not bred you scholars. I love to hear your sweet debating, With ane word Scots, the other Latin; There's nane of all the bairn-time stupid, Their beards may all wag in the pulpit: E'en Sandy, if to next year spar'd, May be a chaplain to a laird. But, hear me Willie; ye're the eldest, I ken you can a story tell best; With all your clergy tell the wonder, I cannot, tho' I'm near an hunder, Why my teeth, younger than my tongue, Hard as a stane or well dry'd rung, Should moulder like a rotten liver, Yet my soft tongue continue clever? Or why shoe-soles so soon decay, In less than six months quite away, Yet my thin hide should never wear, Tho' daily worn this ninety year? Or, tell me, if you ken the matter, Why ale, being thicker far than water, Should in my throat get easy downfal, But water choaks me; were't a spoonful? TINK. DOCTOR. Grandam, I'll answer all your wonders, Beginning at the first, your grinders; Must not that wear which ne'er lies still, Ay grinding like the Canno-mill; You're just a mill, your mouth's the happer, Your teeth the mill-stanes, tongue the clapper; Ye ken the clapper is but thin, And, like your tongue, ay making din; Yet it will wear out twenty mill-stanes, Tho' they are kent not to be ill stanes, As to the second, you'd consider, That beasts have different kinds of leather; Shoe-soles from dead-beasts they do flae, But ye are living, lang be't sae. As to the last, 'bout ale and water, Ale gangs down, 'cause you like it better. GRANDAM. The last's the truest of the three, The shame a word of that's a lie. TINK. DOCTOR. Gran'am, I've answer'd all your questions, Give's a tale, ane of your best anes. GRANDAM. I'll tell you a tale,âIn the days of Cromwell, When Charles the first from the throne did tumble; I was about fourteen years and an half old, When the rogues took his head aff on a scaffold: We were very ill-fash'd with the English land-loupers, And the hail country was o'er-run with moss troopers; I went out upon a night with my sister Jean, I mind very well 'twas on Valentine's-e'en; We'd been drawing our valentines, I drew John Strang, He had a base property, 'twas scyre wrang; Red hair'd, dish brow'd, Bladder lipped, meikle mow'd, We met with my auld jo Geordie Brown, He liv'd, when he was living, in th'Overtown, His face was big and fair like a fu' moon; He had on a suit with prince's metal button, His twa hands were like twa hind legs of mutton; I'm sure it was not with eating, he was nae glutton. His legs mens'd all the parish at kirk and market, He said to me, 'tis bawdy, I had best hark it; Lend me your lug, Giles, and I'll round it in, Now for your life, limmer, offer to tell't again: But we were cry'd back on, by my sister Mary, So Geordie and we fell to play at blind Hary. Geordie gigled and leugh ay, when I was ta'en, And the place he gript me by, was the wame; But the farmers coming in to bir?n? their placks, We left the drunken carles to their own cracks, We went to the barnyard and play'd bogle about the stacks. When I was wearied with hiding, and he with pursuing, We sat down at a haystack, and fell close to the wooing; He slaver'd all my lips, and turn'd very uncivil, He thrust up his hand the length of my navel; I gar'd all the folk hear me, and cry'd out like a devil. The de'il take me, quoth I, blessing myself, if I be your lown, Sae tell me, are you in mows or earnest, Geordie Brown? I'm in earnest, quo' Geordie, 'tis better nor cracking, Make nae noise, Bessie, 'tis ay good to be taking; But out came my mither with a rock in her bosom, She gave him his paiks, and soundly did toss him. He took to his heels and scour'd thro' the green, So I'll never forget that Valentine's e'en. TINK. DOCTOR. Gran'am, I'm ay fear'd you've been an auld sinner, You love a bawdy tale, as I do my dinner. I'll tell you a tale should not be forgotten, The wife I'm speaking of is both dead and rotten: An honest Cameronian near the Bow-head, She was sae very afflicted when her husband was dead, Ev'ning and morning she went to the Gray-friars; (If this be not true, many ane's liars). It happen'd anes as she went there to mourn, But first she behoved to make her burn; And hunk'ring down upon the cauld grass, A thistle on the grave jagged her arse, She thought her buttocks were touch'd by old cuff, Thrusting his hand up thro' the turf; She ran away crying, five times or six, Dead or alive you mind your auld tricks. MAUSE. Out fy, brother, ye stain your profession, If you speak that way I'll tell the session; A story that's bawdy is not worth a plack man, I'll tell you a tale of Jamie the packman. Ye cou'd not but ken gleid Jamie Cunningham, As he was travelling within a mile of Tunningham, He sat down at a fauld dyke for to ease his back, 'Twad bursten our mare to've carry'd his pack: As he was rising to gang some miles farther, He hitched his pack o'er his left shoulder; The swing of the pack brought him to the ground, And choak'd him dead; the laird of the ground, On the very spot where his servants fand him, Put up a stane with this memorandum. Whate'er come of the pack, Spend ay the other plack, And let ne'er your gear o'ergang you, Keep ay your back light, And your pack tight, And then it never will hang you. Little JAMIE. Gran'am, give me a pair of new breiks, And I'll tell you some things will gar you rive your cheeks. GRANDAM. Blessings upon the wean, hear how he speaks, My dear, ye'll not want it, if I should buy them with straiks. Little JAMIE. 'Twas auld lang syne, in an hamely converse, A Scotsman bade the king and court his a?se. GRANDAM. Mislear'd fallow, the meikle devil speed him, I'm sure the king wad gar hang him; or head him. Little JAMIE. Indeed he did neither, but thought him a fit tool, To be carry'd to court, and made the king's fool. GRANDAM. They turn all fools goes there, Jamie, that's nae lie, Our laird spends his siller there ilka bawbie; He had anes a bra' fortune, its a' gaue to wrack; For London's a place that herries the pack; I believe, this day he's not worth five and a plack. The lords and lairds that gae up fae fast thither, Are just like the bairns that forget their auld mither; And like the northland folk, that come from beyond Tay, To return back again they seldom find the way: They say our laird's ta'en up about state affairs, Shame fa' that wark, makes many poor heirs. Little JAMIE. Let us who stay at hame, study to be thrivers, And we'll turn lairds, when the lairds turn dyvers: But Gran'am, let me tell out my bra' sport, How the man spake to the king and his court; 'Twas king James the sixth, when he rang twenty years King of England, and then came down with his peers, To visit Scotland, where he got his being, The kings sinsyne think we're not worth their seeing, King George wadna come if it wad save us frae dying; For these English cuckolds, who would cut our throats, Gar the honest man turn his back on the Scots: I love ay that minister, he was an honest gentleman, Who said ance in a preaching, the devil was an Englishman; And by the reason he gave, it's very true indeed, When scholars raise the devil, he has horns on his head. But to return to my tale, the king and his dunnawassels, Came to so see the Scots gentry and all his vassals; As he lodg'd on the road, where they sauld brandy and ale, And the king was turn'd canty with the other gill; He asked the landlord, how long he'd liv'd there: The man answered, five hundred years and mair, I and my predecessors, tho' you may think it a base lie, 'Tis as true as ony thing in the black book of Paisley. Do you ken, said the king, wha was your chief, He was hang'd, quo' the man, on the gallows of Crieff, Waes me, quo' the king, it seems he's been a thief. Indeed I'm sure he was nae that, quo' the other, But king David gart hang baith him and his brother. What was the crimes they dy'd for, said king James, May be they were rebels, what was their names? Indeed, answer'd the man, they were not baptiz'd, But just took to themselves what names they pleas'd; For the sign of the cross, us'd then by popish fallows, Look'd as if the bairns were to die on the gallows: But for the good of Scotland, they gat aft sair banes; The name of the eldest was, Praise-god Bair-banes: The second brother's name, who was a laird in the Merse, Was, an't please your majesty, Kiss-my-a?se: Bare-banes came to be treasurer, by which he wan siller, And for two years together, Kiss-my-a?se chancellor; But thereafter Bare-banes was chancellor, for he was a cunning spark, And Kiss-my-a?se was twice justice clerk: Yet falling some way thereafter under the king's anger, They kend they wad be hang'd, if they stay'd ony langer; Sae they travell'd in disguise, that they might not be kend, And turn'd baith of them trencher-makers to their life's end: They travell'd with tinkers and gypsies, thro' mony man's ground: Bare banes made his four nooked, Kiss-my-a?se's were all round. GRANDAM. Sirs, heard you e'er a bairn speak sae in his age, He'll be the tinklarian all o'er, I see by his visage, Who is well kend to be the prettiest man in this age. Inscription in the Carters Hall in Leith. Great God, whose potent arm does drive the sun, Thee Carters bless whilst wheels of time shall run: Of old they drove thy sacred ark, O God, Guide thou their hands and steps in every road. Protect this house they dedicate to thee, Increase and sanctify their charity. Thy blessing, Lord, be its foundation-stone, And they'll ascribe the praise to thee alone. The Self-tormentor. There is a wretch, the greatest wretch alive, Eager for gold, yet wants the art to thrive. This devil of a man, with magic spell Torments himself and antedates his hell. Still pain'd with some imaginary loss, And he before he wants, will coin a cross. His mind and he are at perpetual strife, So loses all the sweets, and dear delights of life, A constant gloom sits on his lab'ring brow, He speaks in broken sentences to you. Five hundred pounds per annum gives this squire, Five hundred faggots to augment the fire. This hour he fears some charter has a flaw, Next session will be casten at the law. His infant heir will spend what he has gain'd, And thus, like Ixion, to the wheel he's chain'd. His growing girl will rob him of his pelf, And chuse some brawny bankrupt for herself, Perhaps his wife with horns will plant his head, And bastards shall succeed him when he's dead. Corns will be cheaper in the coming years, So he'll be ruin'd quite with modest fiars. The reverse of good nature and good sense, Who will not trust a groat to providence. Happy the easy man devoid of care, Lives on his stock, and seeks supply by pray'r: By prudent methods seeks a fair estate, Nor doth he sink to meet with adverse fate. The Pretended Town-cryer. By a gentleman who borrowed the bell-man's cloak and bell, and rung, and repeated the verses as under, through the streets of Edinburgh, at four o'clock in the morning, May 10. 1720. All you that in your beds do lie, Turn wame to wame and occupy; And when that you have done your best, Turn back to back and take your rest. Good morrow my masters all. The Lost Maidenhead. Why should I weep, why censur'd by the law, For losing of the thing I never saw? Robin, with whom I'm blam'd, dare freely say, Whate'er he gave, he nothing took away: How then can that be lost which none hath found, And neither is above nor yet below the ground? They say my market's made; but they are mad, For I have all the ware I ever had; The spot is extant, Robin's welcome there, He never did me harm, stole neither hide nor hair. On the 28th May, G. I. At Cana once heaven's Lord was pleas'd, Amongst blyth bridal folks to dine, And then, to crown that happy feast, Turn'd jars of water into wine. But when for joy of B?k's birth, Our tribunes mounted the theatre, Heaven would not countenance their mirth, But turn'd their claret into water. The Presbyterian Pope. Kirk Treasurer. Dawty, how goes the honest trade? Waesucks to see you sae ill clad, I kend whan ye was right well fed, Look'd fat and fair; At which my heart was unco glad, But now 'tis sair. I dow na bide to see you traiked, Wi' bachel'd shoon, and a?se half naked, As if the very streets you raked, Wi' skin sae blae, The daft young lairds should a' be paiked, That lets't be sae. Nae body hears us; tell me, Meg, Wi' wham ye lifted last your leg, For ilk ane kens ye manna beg, Though stocks be low; Now tell the truth and dinna' fleg, Was't wi' a beau? Anes a' your customers I kend; For then you made a bonny send, And wrought sae close wi' your daft end, Baith day and night, Ye ay had boddles for to spend, And that was right. Meg. Sin' you came on, my trade's been dead, How can young lasses get their bread! Ah! John, the d?'s in your greed, You grip at a', I think my very heart will bleed, I'll break my ga'. I canna' get salt to my kail, Though anes I tauld a bonny tale. For twenty shillings, as dock-mail, Each night I got, But now, since trade began to fail, Scarce win a groat. For should I walk to Abbey yards, To catch bra' officers and lairds, Invite them in to play at cards, And drink and crack, Behold a party of the guards Is at our back. Beadles will harle me by the gown, A warld's wonder through the town, Shop keepers wives cry there's a lown, Halloo the bawd, Me to correction-house send down, And put me mad. The fowk before that had your place, Wad pity'd me in sic a case; They never pat me to disgrace To make sic trips, My bennison light on their face, We ran ay snips. They kend 'twas me that fill'd their banks, And kindly said, Meg, play your pranks Wi' married fowk, we'll gi' you thanks, Fa' close to wark; Ha'e, there's silk stockings to your shanks, And a new sark. Indeed I manna' do them wrang, John Couper was their aid-de-cang. Aft on the streets wi' me did gang, He kend his craft, That makes his purse the day sae strang, And puts him daft. Mony kirk-treas'rer I've made rich, I learn'd my art to sic a pitch, They ca'd me ay their setting b?h; Well did I set Covies of lairds; syne, in a touch, John drew his net: Scarcely was I thrown on the bed Whan John pap'd in his bogle head, Said, gentles, there is nae remead, I'm very sure; Guard, carry these folks aff wi' speed, And that vile whore. Fy on ye, sirs, to lead sic lives, Ye that have dainty bairns and wives, 'Twere an alms-deed to cut wi' knives Your gear awa'; 'Tis fowk like you that never thrives, Fy on you a'. Yet, if you promise to turn better, I'll not affront you for the matter, To the kirk-treasurer write a letter, Come in his will; Lay down the talents, or be debtor, By band or bill. K. Treas. Na', Meg, you're e'en worth gowd, I vow, We canna want the like of you, Serve me that way, and ye's no rue, But mense your kin, Slip in to company that's fou, And tempt to sin. I'll mind you in my pray'rs, we should Wish well to them that do us good, I hope by you to get my food, I need not fear't; My bird, ha'e there's a bra' new hood, Well may you wear't. Meg, you that make a trade of sinning, Shou'd ay be cleanly in your linen, And trip as trig as ony kinnin; Why should ye droop? Ye've got a better trade than spinning, E'en buy a hoop. 'Twas a raw sinner at the game, (For at the first ye a' think shame) Contriv'd them for to hide her wame, Whan it grew big, I winna' tell the lady's name, She was a W?g. Now, shou'd not this keep up your heart, That quality do take your part, That they shou'd study ev'ry art Practis'd by you? Gae 'bout your business, and look smart, Ye's find me true. Meg. There's some fowk wou'd there manhood try, And with a pretty young wench ly, For that end would a licence buy, And have your leave, And that's the thing you'll no deny, As I believe. Master, be pleas'd to take a fee, And frae the creepie make them free, What profit is't to you or me, To spoil their sport? K. Treas. Meg, bring them here, and we'll agree, There's my word for't. Meg. My master's as great as the pope; (Papist rogue, gi'e him a rope) He keeps a Presbyterian shop, Pardons to sell, And he'll turn wond'rous rich I hope, He's turn'd sae fell. Popes shut up nuns with iron-gates, And will not let them do fine feats, But our kind master, father Y?s. Dawts his ain bawds, As if they were his bairns, and lets Them play wi' lads. The nuns are burnt that play wi' fryars, Or else there mony ane that's liars, But the kirk-treas'rer never spiers, He's nae sae rash, Wi' wham we ly for twenty years, If he get cash. Incest, or ony other sin, We may commit wi' nearest kin, And yet come aff wi' a hail skin, 'Tis his behoof, Wi' fowk not to make meikle din, That criesh his loof, But, if we have nae thing to spare, Then we maun rin wi' shoulders bare, Dalgliesh's tause makes us sae sair, That they flae us, Thrawn carle! I'm sure he wad na care For to slae us. K. Treas. Meg, we stay on but for a year, If in that time we get na' gear, We'll e'en starve when we're auld, I fear, Be hungry slaves; To speak the truth, and not to jeer, We're e'en a' knaves. Meg. Master, the greater knave the better, The only way for to rise greater, For honesty will scarce hald water, A tale hum drum, If money's got, what d?l's the matter What way it come? I laugh to see the fowk look blate, Wha pay and get na a receipt, Ye neither set down day nor date, 'Tis a bra' sport, An honest piece of deep deceit; Fair fa' you for't. K. Treas. Na hussy, should I grant them lines, And tell how much I got for fines, 'Twad gar me count with our divines, I'm very sure; Shame fa' the treas'rer never minds To help the poor. Judas, wha was kirk-treas'rer first, For cheating of the kirk, was curst, He hang'd himself, and syne he burst, For ae poor faut, Had he in a' our tricks been nurs'd, He'd ne'er done that. Tho' we the kirk do daily plunder, Cheating her out of mony a hunder, If we hang ourselves, 'twill be a wonder As e'er was heard; We'll ne'er commit sae foul a blunder, Na, dinna fear't. The Highland-men for cutting purse, Lifting Lawland cows and horse, Sometimes, though seldom, take remorse, And they're disgrac'd; But we kirk-treas'rers that do worse, Are not strait-lac'd. Meg. Master, your pensionary's gane; Ye ken your awn lass Waterstane, Wae's me the silly slut was ta'en, The best o' lowns, Because she wad na ly her lane, But wi' dragoons. K. Treas. Meg, Meg, ill news, that she is lost! I fear she will gi' up the ghost; But wha think ye shall fill her post? Gae through the town, Wyle well, my jo, whate'er it cost, There's half a crown. Meg. I ken a chuck of cliver sense, The jade was bred wi' luckie Spence, And new laid to when she went hence, That was nae fool, Well did she learn the art to fence, At her sweet school. My winsome dad, nae body's near us, Sae wha in a' the warld can hear us, Make acts wi' penalties to fear us, And keep's in awe, And upon saul and conscience swear us To keep them a'. Taylors and websters ne'er were leel, Yet for the good of common weal, To gi'e his due e'en to the de'il, They've seal o'cause, And deacon too, to gar them feel The weight of laws. At Rotterdam the hogan pow'rs, (And that's a whiggish town like ours) The lowns in public stews secures; The Dutch are wise, And put placards upon the doors To tell their price. The auldest trade that's in the nation, Amaist as auld as the creation, Shou'd be made an incorporation, I'm no in joke, That we may trade wi' reputation, Like burger fowk. K. Treas. It may be done, Meg, say nae mair, I'm deacon, and I'll take the chair, For clerk we'll hae the wyle of ware, Auld L?n; Rob Forbes shall be officer, As good's in town. Meg. Then let us think upon a way, Or else fair trade will soon decay, To gar the Glasgow women stay Without our port; They come sae thick in every day They spoil our sport. Hame at their awn town let them bide, D?l nor they were a' drown'd in Clyde; A man can purchase their backside, For poor twa groats, And drink of that wi' them beside, Aught shillin' Scots. Wi' bibles and psalm books they cant, As ilk ane of them were a saint, Wi' holy keckle, pegh and pant, And greet and grain, That ev'ry godly Bow head plant, Gaes now to them. Repeating lectures, sermons, graces, Telling saul-exercise and cases, And making sic Wast-country faces, That I sair fear, That we may a' resign our places, If they thrang here. K. Treas. Ye're scyre-wrang, Meg; for wi' their greeting, And notes of Mr Clark's repeating, And mony scripture texts ay citing, And singing psalms; Neighbour's think 'tis a holy meeting Of God's ain lambs. Your tory lowns are worst to guide, They cannot their ain secret hide; Whane'er they lay their legs aside, Or drink to James, They blaze what's done baith far and wide, And tell fowks names. If ye wad paukily succeed, Prove a rank hypocrite indeed, Subscirbe to the kirk treas'rer's creed, And ye'll win cash, Let honesty ne'er fash your head, 'Tis tory trash. The Kirk-Treasurer's Creed. I do believe 'tis in my pow'r, T'indulge and tolerate a whore, For liberty of conscience sure, The kirk-can gi'e: And by my office I procure That right to me. Now, Meg, you see that I'm high priest, And the Pope's power is a dull jest, Whan sinners have my loof well criesht, Wi' a good fee, I'll let them sin, they make me feast, And baith agree. The Cameronian Tooth. Papists, ye'er fairly foil'd, think shame and blush, Your various relics are not worth a rush: What's Mary's milk, St. Peter's rotten bones, When in procession born by human drones? What wonders can they do? confess the truth; They're nothing to a Cameronian tooth, Which a grave holy sighing sister wears, That in the grave lay five and fifty years; And that was Mrs Mary Crighton, A Cameronian pious right one. Imboss'd in gold it dangled at her heart, Corroborating lungs, and strength'ning every part. When tooth ach does affect the tender jaws, It heals all pains, and takes away the cause. Grand miracle! who can believe 'tis true, That rotten teeth should cure the teeth that's new? Fits of the mother it cures, and vapours too, This wonder-working tooth all things can do. Prevents abortion when ty'd on the knee, They wear that tooth where standing t?ce should be. She shew'd to me a box wherein lay hid, The pictures of Cargil and Mr Kid; A splinter of the tree on which they're slain; A double inch of Major Weir's best cane; Rathillet's sword beat down to table knife, Which took at Magus-muir a bishop's life; The worthy Welch's spectacles, who saw That windle straws would fight against the law; The windle straws were stoutest of the two, They stood their ground, away the prophet flew. And lists of all the prophets names were seen, At Pentland-hills, Ard-moss, and Rullen-green. Don't think, she says, these holy things are fopery, They're precious antidotes against the power of Popery. Rome's Legacy to the Kirk of Scotland; A Satyr on the Stool of Repentance. Risum teneatis amici. When Pop'ry was pull'd down in days of yore, Hastily banish'd from our Albion shore; The subtle Jesuits contriv'd a way The Protestant religion to betray. Some things they left behind to prove their claim, And the reformers title to be lame. They gave the surplice to the English prelates, And their repenting stools to Scottish zealots. In these love-tokens both such pleasure take, As if they hugg'd them for the giver's sake. The first my muse may satirize ere long; The last shall be the subject of this song. Hail ancient relic of the Roman See! Now vampt by a reforming Presbyt'ry. Old, as the papal chair, thy days began, When priest-craft lorded o'er the rights of man; And men of royal blood did meanly go To Antichrist at Rome, and kiss'd his toe. When the blind laity mumbled o'er their beads, Ave Marias sung and Latin creeds; Trick'd by designing priests, and monks with shaven heads. Penance was broach'd: by pious frauds betray'd, The laity swallow'd all that priest-craft said. Religion sunk with tales, there did succeed, A wafer worship, and a god of bread. So artfully the priests led th'easy fools, That, cloath'd in sackcloth on repenting stools, They thought their mortal sins were all forgiv'n, And this the meritorious way to heav'n. By th'same priest-craft we are chain'd secure, Though we've renounc'd th'usurping papal pow'r; The trick prevails, our scandal and our shame, With such effects as I'm afraid to name. How dare priests of this Romish idol boast, Which hath such blood and such damnation cost? If we consult our records, there we'll see, 'T has made a hundred on a gibbet die. That cursed engine of the Roman power Which doth our lives and very souls devour! If fair Servilia's virtue make a slip, By Rufus tempted to the youthful trip; Soon as her pregnant womb begins to rise, The quick'ning tomb where all her sorrow lies, On every wall she reads that doleful sentence, The place where fornicators make repentance. Fearful she falls into Belshazzar's fit, When Mene Tekel on the wall was writ. Untouch'd with deep remorse, she doth not mourn, And to a clement Saviour return; No, no, she doth not think on heav'n or hell; On the repenting-stool that thoughts do dwell: The terrors of that awful seat prevails, And oh! she listens to the devil's tales. Satan suggests, for he's a cunning foe, And will ye to your shame and ruin go; Mount up a cock stool to be gaz'd upon, In face of all the parish, and the sun; Disgrace your friends, and get the name of whore, And bear the scandal to your dying hour? A bastard's slave, and a despised wretch You'll live, and never need expect a match: Think on a way to keep the name of maid; And thus the poor unthinking girl's betray'd. The hen-wife and old nurse, her fatal friends, Contrive, and soon find out the murd'ring means; And she goes on, while Satan holds the reins, Until she gets a halter for her pains: For that's the punishment of wicked fools; And the result of our repenting stools. My muse record, and don't priest's odium fear, How once they serv'd a noble cavalier: Because that he transgress'd the seventh command, They dragg'd him to the stool, there made him stand, Cloathed in sackcloth, that disgraceful weed, And a spiritual barber shav'd his head. With passion mad, thus to be made a jest, He drew a knife and sheath'd it in his breast, And, dying left his blood upon the priest. Tell me, ye priests, why doth there never stand Upon your stools the nobles of the land? Is it like cob-webs, which small flies do catch, But cannot hold the great ones and the rich? Oh! this is partial in the highest pitch. The pious tricksters in the days of old, Grown rich with royal spoils, turn'd fierce and bold, Compell'd our nobles who did aid their king, (For loyalty with them's a dangerous thing) T'abjure the Stewarts title to the crown, And kirk-men's livery wear, a sackcloth gown; Mount up the stool to be expos'd to mock, And bow before Mess John's all conqu'ring cloak, There hear loud thunders from the pulpit crack, And wear an antic fool's-coat on their back. At Scoon, where kings commenc'd their regal toil, Their sacred fillets wet with Aaron's oil; Where they the royal purple robes put on, And in the marble chair receiv'd a crown; Did royal Charles, the blessed martyr's heir, In Presbyterian pageantry appear. On the repenting stool the hero stood, A spectacle to the admiring crowd; And to the cruel cloak the sceptre bow'd. This saucy cloak upbraids the Stewarts race; And spits its venom in the sovereign's face. Fanatic fetters held the god-like man, Thus the prophane, pedantic speech began: âSir, openly your sins must be confest, âTell you're an hawk of an unkanny nest: âYour fathers bow'd their knees to Dan and Baal, âAnd were a plague unto our Israel, âLifting their hands against the Lord of hosts, âAnd put the prideful prelates in their posts. âAre ye sincerely sorry for your sin, âAnd all the errors of your Christless kin? âWill ye the cov'nant's int'rest now betroth, âAnd take it for your coronation oath! âWith all your power idolatry withstand, âSupport the reformation work in hand; âAnd disappoint your godly peoples fears? âOr else you'll find your crown, a crown of briers.â Ye superstitious, bow not to the east, Nor, when the sermons done, salute the priest. With awful rev'rence give a lowly bow, To this exalted stool, the royal pew. Pay homage to it as a regal chair, Since sov'reign majesty did once stand there. My muse relate the eloquence of Cant, A chief apostle, and the northern saint; How he rebuk'd one of our antient peers, An aged sinner sunk with weight of years; âWhat look you like, old rotten sinner, say? âAt eighty years you whore, and cannot pray. âThe peer reply'd in language very meek, âSaint Andrew, I am really like a leek; âWhite is my head, and very green my tail, âI'm made of flesh, and flesh you know is frail.â Were't not for what poor ignorants sustain, Who've much of fear and very little brain, Blyth folk would wish that stools would still remain, 'Tis such diversion when the men stand there, As Fabius tells the tale with pleasant air; Bare-headed beadles usher to the seat, I walk in pomp like minister of state; When I the solemn sackcloth weed do wear, And gravely mount the penitential chair, My gown arrests the eyes of all the flock, Who mocks the preacher threshing in his cloak; There I in triumph sit 'bove every Whig, Adjust my cravat and my campaign-wig; Spread wide the badge of sin to show my cloaths, And with a napkin brush my silken hose; Young lasses whispering, laughing like young apes, Say, He's a hopeful sinner, see his shapes; But their mammas, who gave me secret kisses, Tremble, lest I should tell mess John my misses; Proclaim in noon-day what I've done in dark, And point at all the cuckolds in the kirk. A matron midwife, rocking on her knee A new born child, looks up and smiles on me; Methinks I hear the superannuate jade, Say, Blessings on the man keeps up the trade: Fy on them! makes him climb that rotten chair, 'Twere fitter far to send our fumblers there. A scene of objects opens to my view, Conceal'd from these lock'd in a lower pew; Sometimes I on the window cast mine eye, And see a subtile spider pinch a fly, The feeble warriors combat in the field, Till the poor captive fly is forc'd to yield, And the proud victor trails her to his den, With as much triumph as prevails 'mong men. Then turning to the pillars, there I read The honours on th'escutcheous of the dead; Tall heroes who in battle made a figure, And trac'd the steps of Presbyterian rigour: These tatter'd ensigns do their valour prove; But I'm the living monument of love. Wearied with ease, my meditation falls, On texts of scripture, pasted on the walls: Devoutly I peruse our Saviour's prayer, Full of amazement that I see it there; The pious criminal maintains its place, Altho' expell'd the house with deep disgrace: I read the ten commands; but one short line, Makes me soon wish they were reduc'd to nine; That line makes me stand here, and now Mess John Knits his stern brow, and with a canting tone, Acquaints me that my trial's coming on: A tryal which doth the justiciary mock, The judge wrapt up in a Geneva cloak. The scarlet chequer'd with the ermine, shew, That as they've justice, so they've mercy too: But O! I tremble, and I scratch my lug, To be impeach'd before a louse-bare rug. Round a long table, near the pulpit foot, Do fifteen elders of the inquest sit; To show that they the process understand, Each hath a corpus juris in his hand, With silver clasps, and fine Geneva notes, Which they demurely mumble thro' their throats; A clumsy fiscal in the desk doth stand, Holding a short indictment in his hand; The justice general in the holy chair, Takes it, and reads it, with fanatic air, Making a long discourse, half preaching and half pray'r, Repeats my youthful feats in Venus' war, For which I'm made a pannel at his bar. I rise, make legs, and bow to all the court, Some burst with laughter at the pleasant sport; I pull my napkin out and wipe my cheeks, As if I wept at every word he speaks: I wring my fingers, and distort my face, Which he concludes are certain marks of grace. Confession made, then doth the judge begin, T'absolve and purge me from my deadly sin; Dismiss'd with joy, and reeling down the stair, I rush to the embraces of my fair. A roll of sins hath got the clergy's score, A good encouragement to sin the more; So honest debtors, when their bills are paid, For to contract a-new are not afraid. Nor dare I say that our division's less, When on the stool appears the buxom Bess, For anti-nuptial dalliance with her spouse, Altho' 'twas ratified with marriage vows; And all the crime she did, was for to eat, Before Mess John had consecrate the meat. Both her clean tartan plaid, and gown of gray, Do native innocence and charms display: Before her face the gilded bible lay: Well may she on the sacred pages look, There's no indictment 'gainst her in that book. Now, when Mess John has wrestl'd out the glass, He leers about and blinks on bonny Bess: Commands her for to lay her plaid aside, Which from the wanton lads her charms do hide; She gathers up her limbs, bows with her tail, Which he must pelt with a spiritual flail. He tugs his cloak, and then begins the wark, O Bessy, Bessy, you have a black mark. An arch wag says, âMess John, that's 'gainst the law, âTo say the thing is black you never saw.â Bess Blushes, and she knows not what to say, All eyes are on her tenement of clay. The old wives mutter, sure Mess John is dreaming, Why should not Bess be like to other women. But Pettigrew goes on to reprimand, Whilst all the people on their tiptoes stand; âWas't not the devil did your heart betray, âOr else you'd keep the feast till the feast day. âYou know the filliest herd lifts off his bonnet, âBefore he takes his cog, and says a sonnet; âBut you threw up your gammonds in the bed, âBefore the grace, and lost your maiden-head. âBessy, an unco haste you have been in, âThat could not wait till I my gloves did win; âI'm sure, 'twas very far from being civil, âTo get your eldest bairn before the devil.â And thus Mess John goes on to act his play, Till all the people laugh, and run away. Thanks to the kirk who thus supports her pow'r, After the model of the Romish whore. The Stablers Honours. ? I. H. S. Where went the virgin mother of our God, When nine months pregnant with the heav'nly load? To stabler's house, the divine dame took flight, His house held more than half of heaven that night. A stable serv'd him for imperial rooms, Whilst dazzling crowds of angels were his grooms. The stabler's fame did quickly fly abroad, Since in his manger lay a cradl'd God. Hither did kings and clergymen resort, To see the humble grandeur of the court. Can herald's office greater honour shew, Than what the King of kings bestow'd on you. The Gardeners Honours. A new born world the Gard'ners task began! Fair art coeval with the first made man! Adam's intendant of the blissful bow'rs, The ever-greens, and sweet ambrosial flow'rs: God breath'd a beauty on its banks, and he Institute there the sacramental tree: There God and man the fed'ral paction made; For the first temple was a silent shade. Sin sow'd the weeds which blasted Eden's bloom, The pois'nous plants usurp the roses room; God's wat'ring pans, the clouds, this garden lost, 'Tis sunk in sea, and sea without a coast. Trees lift their heads again, and floods asswage, The peacful dove flies with the gard'ner's badge, An olive sprig. Noah a vineyard made, And plants and prunes, and consecrates the spade. A gard'ner got th'old world and the new, Ere teeming nature felt the lab'ring plow. Such matchless honour's to the gard'ners giv'n, Christ's from his loins, and all the saints in heaven. The wisest king that ever liv'd on earth, Was botanist, a gard'ner from his birth: Of all productions his learn'd herbal spoke, From dwarfish hyssop, to the giant oak. The eastern sages, when they heard the news Of Bethl'em's babe, born monarch of the Jews, Directed by a star, they reach'd his seat, And offer'd herbage kneeling at his feet. They brought no books with laws or logic stor'd, Present a little garden to our Lord, Myrrh and frankincense; these the senses feast, With all the spicy odours of the east. 'Twas to a garden Jesus went to pray, In drops of blood a sweating Saviour lay; So pounded plants diffuse their rich perfumes, And wounded trees sweat aromatic gums. To wean us from the world's milkless breast, And prove its pride and pageantry all jest; Christ bids us to a blow of flowers repair, And view the lilies in their vernal air; Their raiment never can wear out of mode, Still smiling in the livery of a God: Insulting kings of clay with crowned heads, The weavers vassals wrapt in greasy threads. A dying Jesus at his latest hour, Painted his suff'rings on the passion flower. Kings sick of painful pomp, and regal strife, Threw down their scepters for the pruning knife; Parties at court from an intestine war, Killing in camps, and wrangling at the bar. The merchant smuggles, and the tradesman lies; Pulpits are crush'd with weight of heresies; Of love and concord gard'ners are possest, They're solar plants within the gard'ner's breast. The holy hermit safely shelters there, And vocal makes the cyprus grove with pray'r, And holy virgins, to a God resign'd, In prayer and plants immortal pleasures find; In rich embroideries, copy o'er the flowers, And make their needles praise the divine powers. Parent of vig'rous age, and grave of care, Sweet solitude and sacred silence there, Nurse to devotion; therefore every day, The gard'ner, who hath grace, will humbly pray, âO tree of life, O plant of high renown, âOn gard'ners pour thy heav'nly influence down, âBless thou our seeds, our seasons, and our soil, âWe'll praise thee by our philosophic toil.â Elegy on ROBERT FORBES. Greet a' ye bairns and bairded fo'k, Sic news wad pierce a heart of rock, Death's gi'en a kick to Robin's dock, Shame fa' his greed: He thought that death was ay in joke; But now he's dead. Ay sin' he left the cobling trade, Mending the shoon that others made, He's been a rare reforming blade, Cobling the church; But now he's got the shool and spade, Left in the lurch. Limmers and lairds he'll nae mair chase; Nae mair we'll see his pauky face Keek thro' close-heads, to catch a brace Of waping morts, Play bogle-bo, a bonny chase, About the ports. In turnpike fits he darn'd himsell, At jowing of the ten-hour-bell, Till he on some free-traders fell, Bra' whoring blades; Fleg'd them and girn'd, look'd sour and fell, Like knave of spades, Of traders he kept ay a list, That nightly to his mill brought grist, Soon he abstracted multures mist, That wrang'd his trade: Wi' which he fill'd his awn meal kist, But now he's dead. Aft has he lain on castle brae In moon-light, till his cheeks turn'd blae, To ken where whores and bawds did gae, Haf drunk, haf daft; He needed nae auld wives to spae, He kend his craft. He threw his cloak about his gab, Fidging as gin he had the scab; And bravely follow'd a fat dab, Wi' little din; And when the bed began to bab, Syne Rob came in. Said, graceless bairns, and are ye yoked, Think na the kirk will thus be mocked; Tell me, young laird, what's in your pocket, Red headed lads, Yonkers like you should be well stocked, Meddles wi' bawds. Wi' brieks amang his feet, young laird Cry'd, Robin, dinna bring the guard, Ha'e, there's ten crowns, all can be spar'd Upon my saul, In faith, I think 'tis e'en ill war'd, And 'tis my all. Rob harked in the young laird's lug, Gae to my house, we'll drink a mug, May be I'll let you take a rug Of caller quean. Yon slut smells like a doctor's drug, But mine's fou clean. Big as the great Mogul, when din'd, He walk'd, and John Dalgliesh behind, To his seraglio in Leith-wynd, To take review; The lass that was maist blyth and kind, John kiss'd her mou. Sculdudry-fowk may now sing dool, And steep their graith in a cald pool; Wha now will save them frae the stool In time of need? Rob Forbes was a ready tool, But now he's dead. Though mony ill-far'd names we ca'd him, His maik was ne'er sin' days of Adam, Gie him the lure, whate'er ye bade him, He would obey; Ye might ha' lien with mare or madam, Baith night and day. Wha now will our by-blows provide, And frae our wives adulteries hide? Rob Forbes was a skilful guide, Ca'd them his petts; Now we will hae a thrang fire side, Wi' ill got gets. Sae soon as Robin's loof was greas'd, What creature wad na been well pleas'd, To see how he the brats baptiz'd, Like ony priest! Syne he upon the caddel seiz'd, A bonny feast. Proud was the carle, when he went thro' The landward towns, as grave's a Jew, To see the gaitlings binge and bow, And cry, Pappa, Wow! but he made a devilish mou, And sain'd them a'. Frae a' kirk-fowk he bure the gree, Half mid-wife, nurse, and priest, a' three, He neither curs'd nor bann'd, not he, But was sae civil, The live lang day wad cheat and lie, Like ony devil. Auld wives wi' rocks came to the doors, And yonkers peep'd through holes and bores, To see the captain of the whores, Auld Frig-a-bight, Coming to pay his quarter scores, A seemly sight! Although he play'd the pimp a' week, On Sundays he look'd mild and meek; For scarcely wad ye hear him speak Aboon his breath: Upon his hand he laid his cheek, Like ane near death. On the cap-ambrie cuist his eye, That he might fornicators spy, And muttering to himself, said fy, O dool and care! Might not the man have come to me, And no stood there? But yet before the text was read, Good Robin frae the kirk was fled, His prayers to say at barrel-head, Drinking alane: Red as a turkey-cock the blade Came back again. We loo'd to see his Judas-face, Repeating preachings, saying grace, Unto the tune of Chevy-chase, Shaking his head; Wha will we get to fill his place? For now he's dead. HIS EPITAPH. Here all alone, Beneath this stone, Our rare reformer bides; Who pick'd up crowns By tirling lowns, He scarcely left their hides. Ask not at all, Where went his saul? The question's scarcely civil; Since 'tis well kend, Ill life must end In going to the devil. On the Downfal of Thomas Butter's Nose in the Month of June. Tom was sae subtile, and sae fu' o'greed, Nae man could lick the butter aff his bread; But pox on harlot women, his disgrace, They lick'd a nose of butter aff his face. It did na' take lang time to this mishap, No, no, the bitches did it in a Clap. Who devil took this nose that came away? Not God!âfor he made noses all of clay; And clay grows harder by the summer sun; But Butter-noses must melt down in June. On the Sign of the Three Kings. Long have we had two kings, I do assure ye, A George de facto, and a James de jure: But here's surprising news; a brave M'Ghie Turns parliament himself, and gives us three: None of them all resemble George or James. O, King Creator! will you tell their names? We do not know by gazing on their face, If Norman, German, or Fergusian race: Yet, when we think upon't, we learn the story; The sign speaks truth by way of allegory. Three kings expos'd to sale! ye've plac'd them there To show we Scots sell kings like merchant-ware. Three kings were basely sold for English coin, One at Dunbar, another at the Boyn; The third at Sheriff-muir, a fatal day, When Mar mar'd all, and Huntly ran away. Buy up the rogues that sold our antient nation; You'll have the best stock'd shop in all the nation; And when 'tis known such hellish wares you sell, The d?l will pay the price, and take them all to hell. A Poem on the Sign of the Mermaid. Geordie. Wha's dainty bairn are ye, my winsome dear, With apple cheeks, and wame like ony pear? Jamie. May be 'tis nae good manners for to speir. Geo. And bony bubbies, wi' your nut brown hair, And a' your sides, and a' your shoulders bare: War ye some aulder ye'd be worth a pelt. Jam. Ah! Geordie man, she's fish beneath the belt: She'll nae get leave to live, she's e'en sae frail, The lads will suck her lips and eat her tail. Geo. Whish't billy, haith she'll put us in the guard, 'Tis no the first of twenty's been sae sair'd; She wad na take sic treatment frae a laird. I find she's ta'en the pet, she will na speak, She's blushing now, glowr on her rosy cheek. Jam. Mistress, I beg your pardon wi' bare head, We country folk are no like gentles bred. Geo. She's e'en the greatest ferly e'er I saw, The d?l a leg has she, and we ha' twa; I wonder how she gangs unto the kirk, Or how she keeps her feet when it grows mirk! Jam. Feet! fiend a fit she has, but twa sweet hands Whiter than curds, and tight like willy-wands; They need nae feet that's carried in sedans; Geordie, how she does pish I canna learn, I'm sure she'll be an unco cleanly bairn. Geo. Daft gouk, great folks bairns is nae like ours, Kakying their coats and clarting a' the doors: They spit their tea and croudie at their mouth, That gars them be of sic a feckless growth. How she'll be got with bairn I marvel more, Her belly's big enough, but wants a door: Perhaps the dunnawassels hae nae bungs, But like the doves they gender by the tongues. Jam. If they spew weans at their mouth like croudie, I think they need na' fash to fetch the houdie. Geo. Ha ha, boy, I can tell you e'er I pish, The thing that makes the lass's a?e a' fish; Her minny and her dade have Papists been, And got the fleshy part on Fasten's e'en; And when the beef and a' the brose was spent, They fed on fish and got the lass in lent. Jam. As I maun answer, Geordie, ye ding a', Ye should na been a herd, but man o'law, Farewel bra' bairn, I hae nae mair to say, But when a' flesh rise at the judgment day, Only the half of you will flie away. Petition of the Shoemaker Apprentices. To the worshipful cordiners of the West-port, A humble petition is offer'd in court, By 'prentice-boys, who would fain take a drink, Be blyth, like their masters, but want ready clink. Ye sons of old Crispin, a saint and a king, When taking your bottle and eating your ling Their entertainment was dry'd ling., All merrry like Greeks o'er a pint and a gill, With the best of good fellows, honest old deacon Hill; Remember that we are the same flesh and blood, Tho' we have not a bit, and are chewing our cud; For though we are young and raw-mouth'd beginners, We may live like yourselves to be old rotten sinners; On this solemn occasion when chusing our deacon, You'll generous prove the apprentices reckon; For on a feast day we resolve not to fast, Tho' we should pawn our awl and venture our last; When lads of the trade in company mingle, Can they bend leather chew, or lick a cold lingle; So we pray and expect, like kind hearted men, You'll send us a hearty charity ben; And we shall all pray, while our judgment abides, May you never wear horns, and never want hides. Lucky SPENCE's Last Advice. Three times the carlin grain'd and rifted, Then frae the cod her pow she lifted, In bawdy policy well gifted, When she now faun That death nae longer wad be shifted, She thus began: My loving lasses I maun leave ye, But dinnae wi' your greeting grieve me, Nor wi' your draunts and droning deave me, But bring's a gill; For faith, my bairns, ye may believe me, 'Tis 'gainst my will. O Black-ey'd Bess, and mim mou'd Meg, O'er good to work or yet to beg, Lay sunkets up for a sair leg, For whan ye fail, Your face will not be worth a feg, Nor yet your tail. Whane'er ye meet a fool that's fow, That ye're a maiden gar him trow, Seem nice, but stick to him like glew, And whan set down, Drive at the jango till he spew, Syne he'll sleep soun. When he's a-sleep, then dive and catch, His ready cash, his rings or watch: And gin he likes to light his match At yor spunk-box, Ne'er stand to let the fumbling wretch, E'en tak the pox. Cleek a' ye can by hook or crook, Ripe ilka pouch frae nook to nook. Be sure to truff his pocket book, Saxty pound Scots Is nae deaf nits: in little bouk Lie great bank-notes, To get amends of whinging fools, That's frighted for repenting stools, Wha aften when their metal cools, Turn sweir to pay, Gar the kirk-boxie heal the dools, Anither day. But dawt red-coats, and let them scoup Free, for the fou of cutty-stoup; To gie them up, ye need nae hope E'er to do well; They'll rive your brats and kick your doup, And play the de'il. There's ae sair cross attends the craft, That curs'd Correction house, where aft Vile Hangie's tauze your riggings saft Makes black and blae, Enough to put a body daft, But what'll ye say? Nane gathers gear withouten care, Ilk pleasure has of pain a share; Suppose then they should tirl ye bare, And gar ye fike, E'en learn to thole, 'tis very fair, Ye're neibour-like. Forby, my looves, count upo' losses; Your milk-white teeth, and cheeks like roses, Whan jet-black hair, and brigs of noses, Fa' down wi' dads; To keep your hearts up 'neath sic crosses, Set up for bawds. Wi' well criesh'd loofs I hae been canty, Whane'er the lads wad fain hae faund ye; To try the auld game Taunty Ranty, Like cussers keen, They took advice of me your aunty, If ye were clean. Then I took up my siller ca', And whistl'd ben whiles ane, whiles twa; Round in his lug, that there was a Poor country Kate, As halesome as the well of Spaw, But unco blate. Sae whane'er company came in, And were upo' a merry pin, I slade away wi' little din, And muckle mense, Left conscience judge, it was a' ane To lucky Spence. My bennison come on good doers, Who spend their cash on bawds and whores; May they ne'er want the wile of cures For a sair snout; Foul fa' the quacks wha that fire smoors And puts nae out. My malison light ilka day On them that drink and dinna pay, But tak a snack and rin away; May't be their hap, Never to want a gonnorhea, Or rotten clap. Lass, gi'e us in anither gill, A mutchken, jo, let's tak our fill; Let death syne registrate his bill, Whan I want sense; I'll slip awa' wi' better will, Quo' Lucky Spence. Elegy on Lucky WOOD in the Canon gate, May 1717. O Cano' gate! poor elritch hole, What loss, what crosses dost thou thole; London and death gars thee look droll, And hing thy head, Wow, but thou has e'en a cauld coal To blaw indeed! Hear me, ye hills, and every glen, Ilk craig, ilk cleugh, and hollow den, And echo shrill, that a' may ken The waefou thud By rackless death, who came unseen To Lucky Wood. She's dead o'er true, she's dead and gane, Left us and Willie burd alane, To bleer and greet, to sob and mane, And rug our hair, Because we'll ne'er see her again, For evermair. She gaed as fait as a new prin, And kept her houssy snod and been; Her pewther glanc'd upo' your een Like siller plate; She was a donsy wife, and clean Without debate. It did ane good to see her stools, Her board, fire side, and facing tools; Rax, chandlers, tangs, and her fire-shools, Basket wi' bread; Poor facers now may chew pea-hools, Since Lucky's dead. She ne'er ga' in a lawin fause, Nor stoups a' froth aboon the hause, Nor kept dow'd tip within her waws, But reaming swats; She never ran sour jute, because It gi'es the bats. She had the gate sae well to please, With gratis beef, dry fish, or cheese, Which kept our purses ay at ease, And health in tift, And lent her fresh nine-gallon trees, A hearty lift. She ga' us aft hail legs of lamb, And did nae hain her mutton ham; Then ay at Yule, whane'er we came, A bra' goose-pye; And was nae that good belly-baum Nane dare deny. The writer lads fou well may mind her, Furthy was she; her luck design'd her Their common mither, sure nane kinder Ever brake bread; She has na' left her maik behind her, But now she's dead. To the sma' hours we ast sat still, Nick'd round our toasts and snishing mill; Good cakes we wanted ne'er at will, The best of bread, Which aften cost us mony a gill, To Aikenhead. Could our saut tears like Clyde down rin, And had we cheeks like Corra's lin, That a' the warld might hear the din Rair frae ilk head; She was the wale of a' her kin, But now she's dead. O Lucky Wood! 'tis hard to bear The loss; but oh! we maun forbear; Yet sall thy memory be dear While blooms a tree, And after ages bairns will speir 'Bout thee and me. EPITAPH. Beneath this sod Lies Lucky Wood, Whom a' men might put faith in: Who was na' sweir, While she winn'd hear, To cram our wames for naething. Elegy on MAGGY JOHNSTON who died anno 1711. Auld Reeky mourn in sable hue, Let fouth of tears dreep like May-dew, To bra' tippony bid adieu, Which we with greed, Bended as fast as she could brew, But ah! she's dead. To tell the truth now, Maggy dang, Of Customers she had a bang; For lairds and sutors a' did gang, To drink bedeen; The barn and yard was aft sae thrang, We took the green. And there by dizens we lay down, Syne sweetly ca'd the healths a-roun, To bonny lasses black or brown, As we loo'd best; In bumpers we dull cares did drown, And took our rest. When in our pouch we sand some clinks, And took a turn o'er Bruntsfield links, Aften in Maggy's, at Hy jinks. We guzzl'd scuds, Till we cou'd scarce, wi' hale out drinks, Cast aff our duds. We drank and drew and fill'd again, O wow! but we were blyth and sain; Whan ony had their count mistane, O! it was nice, To hear us a' cry, pick your bane, And spell your dice. Fou closs we us'd to drink and rant, Until we baith did glowr and gant, And pish, and spew, and yesk, and maunt, Right swash I trow, Then off auld stories we did chant, Whan we were fu'. Whan we were wearied at the gouff, Then Maggy Johnston's was our houff, Now a' our gamesters may sit douff, Wi' hearts like lead, Death wi' his rung reach'd her a youff, And sae she's dead. Maun we be forc'd thy skill to tine, For which we will right sair repine? Or hast thou left to bairns of thine The pauky nack, Of brewing ale amaist like wine, That gar'd us crack? Sae brawly did the pease-scon tost, Biz i'the quaff, and flee the frost, There wi' gat fu' wi' little cost, And muckle speed; Now wae worth death, our sports a' lost, Since Maggy's dead. Ae summer night I was sae fu', Amang the riggs I gaed to spew, Syne down on a green bank I trow, I took a nap, And sought a night Balillilu, As sound's a tap. And when the dawn begoud to glow, I hirsled up my dizzy pow, Frae 'mang the corn like worry-kow, Wi' banes fu' sair, And kend nae mair than if a ew, How I came there. Some said it was the pith of broom, That she stow'd in her masking loom, Which in our heads rais'd sic a foom, Or some wild seed, Which aft the chappin stoup did toom, But fill'd our head. But now since 'tis sae that we must Not in the best ale put our trust, But when we're auld, return to dust, Without remead; Why should we take it in disgust, That Maggy's dead. Of warldly comforts she was rife, And liv'd a lang and hearty life, Right free of care, or toil, or strife, Till she was stale; And kend to be a kanny wife At brewing ale. Then farewel Maggy douse and fell, Of brewers a' thou bore the bell; Let a' thy gossies yelp and yell, And, without feed, Guess whether ye're in heaven or hell, They're sure ye're dead. EPITAPH. O rare Maggy Johnston. Elegy on JOHN COUPER, Kirk-treasurer's Man, Anno 1714. I warn you a' to greet and drone, John Couper's dead, ohon! ohon! To fill his post alake there's none, That with sic speed, Could sa'r sculdudry out like John, But now he's dead. He was right knacky in his way, And eydent baith by night and day, He wi' the lads his part could play, When right sair fleed; He gart them good bill siller pay, But now he's dead. Of whore hunting he got his fill, And made by't mony a pint and gill; Of his bra' post he thought nae ill, Nor did na need, Now they may make a kirk and mill O't, since he's dead. Although he was nae man of weir, Yet mony ane, wi' quaking fear, Durst scarce before his face appear, But hide their head; The wily carle he gather'd gear, And yet he's dead. Ay now to some part far awa', Alas! he's gane and left it a', May be to some sad whilly wha O' fremit blood, 'Tis an ill wind that does na blaw Somebody good. Fy upon death! he was to blame, To whirl aff John to his lang hame; But tho' his arse be cald, yet fame, Wi' rout of trumpet, Shall tell how coupers awfu' name, Cou'd flee a strumpet. He kend the bawds and lowns fu' well, And where they us'd to rant and reel, He pawkily on them could steel, And spoil their sport, Aft did they wish the meikle de'il Might tak him for't. But ne'er a ane of them he spar'd, Even tho' there was a drunken laird, To draw his sword, and make a faird In their defence; John quietly pat them in the guard, To learn mair sense. There maun they lye till sober grown; The lad neist day his faut maun own; And to keep a' things hush and lown, He minds the poor; Syne after a' his ready's flown, He damns the whore. And she, poor jade, withoutten din, Is sent to Leith wynd-fit to spin, With heavy heart and cleathing thin, And hungry wame, And ilka month a well paid skin, To make her tame. But now they may scour up and down, And safely gang their wa'ks a roun, Spreading the clap through a' the town, But fear or dread, For that great kow to bawd and lown, John Couper's dead. Shame fa' your chandler chafts, O death! For stapping of John Couper's breath; The loss of him is public skaith; I dare well say, To quat the grip he was right laith This mony a day. POSTSCRIPT. Of umquhile John to lie or ban, Shews but ill-will, and looks right shan; But some tell odd tales of the man, For fifty head Can gi'e their aith they've seen him gawn Since he was dead. Keek but up through the stinking stile, On Sunday morning, a wee while, At the kirk door, out frae an isle, It will appear; But take good tent ye dinna file Your breiks for fear. For well we wat it was his ghaist; Wow, wad some fowk, that can do't best, Speak till't, and hear what it confest; 'Tis a good deed, To send a wand'ring saul to rest Amang the dead. The Life and Acts of, or an Elegy on PATIE BIRNIE. In soonet flee, the man I sing, His rare engine in rhyme shall ring; Who slaid the stick out o'er the string, With sic an art; Wha sang sae sweetly to the spring, And rais'd the heart. Kinghorn may rue the ruefu' day, That lighted Patie to his clay, Wha gart the hearty billies stay, And spend their cash, To see his snout, to hear him play, And gab sae gash. When strangers landed, wow sae thrang, Fuffing and peghing he wad gang, And crave their pardon that sae lang He'd been a coming; Syne his bread-winner out he'd bang, And fa' to bumming. Your honour's father dead and gane, For him he first wad make his mane, But soon his face cou'd make you fain, When he did sough, O wiltu, wiltu do't again! And grain'd and leugh. This sang he made frae his ain head, And eke the auld man's mare she's dead, The peats and turfs and a's to lead; O fy upon her! A bonny auld thing this indeed, An't like your honour. After ilk tune he took a soup, And bann'd wi' vir the corky coup, That to the Papists country scoup. To lear ha' ha's! Frae chiels that sing, hap, stap and loup, Wanting the b?s. That beardless capons are na men, We by their fozie springs might ken! But ours, he said, cou'd vigour len To men o'weir, And gar them stout to battle sten' Withoutten fear. How first he practis'd, ye shall hear; The harn pan of an umquhile mare He strung, and strack sounds fast and clear Out o'the pow, Which fir'd the saul, and gar'd the ear, With gladness glow, Sae some auld-gabbed poets tell, Jove's nimble son and lackey snell, Made the first fiddle of a Tuque testudo resonare septem, Callida nervis. Hor. shell; On which Apollo, With meikle pleasure play'd himsel, Baith jig and solo. O Johnny Stocks! What comes of thee? I'm sure thoul't break thy heart and die, Thy Birnie gane, thoul't never be Nor blyth, nor able To shake thy short houghs merrily, Upon a table. How pleasant was't to see thee diddle, And dance sae finely to his fiddle, With nose forgainst the lass's middle; And briskly brag, With cutty steps to ding their striddle, And gar them fag? He catch'd a crieshy webster lown, At runkling of his deary's gown, And wi' a rung came o'er his crown, For being there; But Starker's thrumbs got Patie down, And knoos'd him sair. Wae worth the dog, he maist ha' fell'd him, Revengfu' Pate aft green'd to geld him, He aw'd amends, and that he tell'd him, And bann'd to do't, He took the tid, and fairly fell'd him, For a recruit. Pate was a carle of canny sense; And wanted ne'er a right bein spence, But laid up dollars in defence 'Gainst eild and gout; Well judging gear in future tense, Cou'd stand for wit. Yet prudent fowk may tak the pet; Anes thrawart porter wad na let Him in, while latter meat was het: He gaw'd fu' sair, Flang in his fiddle o'er the yate, Whilk ne'er did mare. But profit may arise frae loss, Sae Pate gat comfort by his cross; Soon as he wan within the close, He dously drew in, Mair gear frae ilka gentle goss, Than bought a new ane. When lying bedfast sick and sair, To parish priest he promis'd fair, He ne'er wad drink fu' ony mair; But hale and tight, He prov'd the auld man to a hair, Strut ilka night. The haly dad with care essays, To wile him frae his wanton ways, And tell'd him of his promise twice: Pate answer'd clever, âWha tents what people raving says, When in a fever?â At Bothwell-brig he gaed to fight, But being wise as he was wight, He thought it shaw'd a saul but slight, Daftly to stand, And let gun powder wrang his sight, Or fiddle hand. Right paukily he left the plain, Nor o'er his shoulder look'd again, But scour'd o'er moss and muir amain, To Reeky straight, And tauld how mony Whigs were slain, Before they faught. Sae I've lamented Patie's end; But lest your grief o'er far extend, Come dight your cheeks, your brows unbend, And lift your head: For to a' Britain be it kend, He is not dead. Inscription on the Cave at Gilmerton. Upon the earth thrives villainy and woe, But happiness and I do dwell below; My hands hewed out this rock into a cell, Wherein from din of life I safely dwell: On Jacob's pillow nightly lies my head; My house when living, and my grave when dead: Inscribe upon it when I'm dead and gone, I liv'd and dy'd within my mother's womb. On JOHN PETTIGREW Minister at Givan. Here lies a rev'rend Givan priest, Who sure against his will's deceast; His soul's to Abram's bosom fled, As by his rev'rend elders said. Others who knew his youthful joys, Say, Sarah's rather was his choice. But be it as it will, his scabbard's humbl'd, Death tripp'd up his heels, and down he tumbled. Lady SHAW's Epitaph. Here lies interr'd beside a witch, Th'oppressor both of poor and rich: How she sends, and how she fares, De'il ane kens, and as few cares. On JOHN BELL. I John Bell smith, lies under this stane, Four of my sons laid it on my wame; I was man of my meat, and master of my wife, And liv'd in my house without meikle strife. If thou be'st a better man in thy time than I mas in mine, Take this stane aff my wame and lay't on top of thine. On THOMAS RYMOUR Maltman in Coupar. Through Christ, I am not inferior To William the conqueror. Rom. viii. 37. On a Blacksmith. My sledge and hammer's both declin'd; My bellows too have lost their wind; My fire's extinct, my forge decay'd, And in the dust my vise is laid; My coal is spent, my iron's gone, My nails are drove, my work is done. On GEORGE FAICHNEY. Beneath this turff lies Geordie Faichney, A gamester and the devil's haickney; Who liv'd by cheating at the cards, Prentice boys and senseless lairds. Blyth was he when he drew his breath, And dy'd a right gay dancing death; Because one day he got his draught in, And burnt the flesh of James M'Naughton, Now Satan's got him by the limb, To do the very same to him: Glad was old Nick, when he got him, Haul'd to his pit that wants the bottom; Whisper'd to him in his ear, My ain Geordie, welcome here. On a LADY. Here lies a lady, who if not bely'd, Took wise St Paul's advice, and all things try'd: Nor stopt she here, but follow'd through the rest, And always stuck the longest to the best. On JANET BEATIE at Montrose. Let earth take earth, the devil his sins again, The world its goods, the soul may heav'n contain. On WEST the Boatman. Here lies boatman West, Who was none of the best; In his youth he was wild, And when old was a child: Being dead at the last, Desir'd old Charon to give him a cast. On a Dwarf at Kilsyth. Beneath this stone here lies a man. Whose body was not full three span; A boon companion day and night, Sir Thomas Henderson of Hystoun, knight. On a Scold. Here lies entomb'd a married man's great woe, A nimble linguist, and a quick tongu'd shrew; She's dead, and earth to earth is flung The earth holds her who could not hold her tongue. On one unknown. Here lies interr'd one good old aunty, Whom death has catch'd in his port manty: She dy'd the age of five and fifty; Shame fa' the hands that first shall lift thee. On JOHN SMITH. Here lies John Smith. Whom death slew for all his pith; The starkest man in Aberlady: God prepare and make us ready. On JOHN SIMPSON in St. Andrews. He of Drumcarro tenant was. And from this life to death did pass; In credit, peace and honesty An emblem of his past. Over the Spade, Shovel, Yoke and Coffin, within a Shield, is written. Here lies a ploughman good enough, Who gain'd his living by the plough. On an Old Woman. Here lies an old woman wrapt in her linen, Mother to James and Thomas Binnin; Who for want of a coffin was buried in a girnel; The earth got the shell, and the devil got the kernel. The Character of a Prison A prison is a house of care, A place where none can thrive, A touchstone for to try a friend; A grave to one alive: Some times a place of right, Some times a place of wrong, Some times a place for whores and thieves, And honest men among.
