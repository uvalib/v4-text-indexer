      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. TO THE Right Honourable THOMAS Earl of Hadinton. MEDULLA POETARUM ROMANORUM. OR, THE Most Beautiful and Instructive PASSAGES OF THE ROMAN POETS. The translations and original Latin text are printed in parallel in the source document. The Latin text has been omitted. References to sources have been presented in sidenotes. Absence. Neglected, now, behold my Tresses flow: Nor sparkling Diamonds on my Fingers glow. All plain, and cheap, the humble Weeds I wear: No Golden Ornament adorns my Hair: My Locks, no longer now, perfum'd diffuse The fragrant Odours of Arabian Dews. Why should I dress, or practice Arts like these? He's gone whom only 'twas my Wish to please!— Ovid. Epist. Saph. Phaoni. I view the Grots, rough-arch'd, whose mould'ring Stone, Fair, once, to me as polish'd Marble shone. The Grove I view, beneath whose friendly Shade, We oft have found a soft delightful Bed: But Him, the lovely Lord of Them and Me, Nor in the Grottoes, nor the Grove I see. What then avails the now detested Place! To Him alone it ow'd it's ev'ry Grace. The with'ring Grass informs me where we lay, And the press'd Plants our mutual Weight betray: There, down I lye, where thy dear Print I view; But first my plenteous Tears the Turf bedew. The Trees with falling Leaves Thee gone deplore, And Birds sweet-warbling charm the Ear no more.— Ibid. More bitter than the hateful An Herb like Smallage, so exceeding bitter and astringent, that it convulsed the Jaws of those who tasted it, and threw them into violent Agonies. Poyson-Plant Sardinia yields, may I be thought by Thee: More rough than Gorse, more vile than with'ring Weeds Which by the Tides are cast upon the Shore: Thus base, thus odious, let thy Swain appear, If this Day seems not longer than a Year.— Virg. Ecl. VII. Here Junipers, and prickly Chesnuts grow, Beneath each Tree it's Apples strew the Ground, And ev'ry Scene with Satisfaction smiles: But from these Hills should fair Alexis fly, You'd find our Rivers leave their Channels dry.— Ibid. Scorch'd are the Fields: with Thirst the Herbage dies: Bacchus the Hills his viny Shade denies: But when my Phillis comes to bless the Plain, The wither'd Groves shall all be green again, And Jove descend in plenteous Show'rs of Rain,— Ibid. When, in its Turn, the Moon obscure withdraws It's Light, and setting Stars perswade to Sleep, Lonely she pines within the empty Court: Lies on the Couch which just before he left: Him absent, absent still she hears and sees.— Trap. Æn. Lib. IV. The Rock, the Wheel, and ev'ry little Toy, Which did the Virgin's sportful Hours employ, In her lost Daughter's stead she fondly press'd Close in her Lap, and hugg'd them to her Breast: Explor'd her empty Bed, and ev'ry Place Which her Child us'd did the sad Mother trace.— Hughes. Claud. Rapt. Pros. Thus anxious is the Bird, whose unfledg'd Young, On some low Ash's slender Twigs are hung, While to fetch Food she roams: her careful Breast Is by a thousand diff'rent Fears possess'd: Lest the rude Wind should shake them from the Tree, Or prying Man the hidden Nest should see, Or cruel Serpents seize the tender Prey, And bear the helpless little Ones away.— Claud. Rapt. Pros. Advice. —If Helenus has any Skill, If any Faith, and if Apollo right Inspires his Prophet: One thing, Goddess-born, One Thing, above the rest, I will advise, And oft repeat it: with religious Pray'r First Juno's Deity adore: to her Pay willing Sacrifices, and with Vows, Suppliant, o'erpow'r the mighty Queen of Heav'n.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. III. Pallas. Arachne presuming to vye with Pallas in the Art of Weaving, the Goddess in Disguise comes to give her good Advice. Arachne. The Goddess then a Matron's Form put on; With silver Hairs her hoary Temples shone: Prop'd by a Staff, she hobbles in her Walk, And, tott'ring, thus begins her old Wife's Talk. Pall. Young Maid, attend, nor stubbornly despise The kind Instructions of the Old and Wise: For Age, tho' scorn'd, a ripe Experience bears, That golden Fruit, unknown to blooming Years. Still may remotest Fame thy Labours crown, And all Mankind thy Skill in Weaving own: But to the Goddess yield, and humbly meek, A Pardon for thy bold Presumption seek: The Goddess will forgive.— —At this the Maid, With Passion fir'd, her gliding Shuttle staid: And scarce refraining Blows, with such a Look As high Resentment shew'd,— To Pallas in Disguise thus fiercely spoke. Ar. Thou doating Thing, whose idle babling Tongue, But too well shews the Plague of living long; Hence, and reprove with this your sage Advice, Your giddy Daughter, or your awkard Neice: Know, I despise your Counsel, and am still A Woman, ever wedded to my Will.— Croxall. Ovid. Met. VI. Now to advise you, since you want Advice: Take heed of whom you speak, and what it is Take heed to whom: avoid the busy Man: Fly the Inquisitive; He'll talk again, And tell what you have said: The leaky Ear Can never hold what it shall chance to hear, But out it runs: What Words you once let fall, For ever gone, no Mortal can recall. Praise none till well approv'd on sober Thoughts, Lest afterwards you blush for Other's Faults: But if you have commended, thro' Mistake, A worthless Rascal, no Excuses make On his Behalf, but give him up to Shame: Yet manfully defend another's Fame, If long Acquaintance has approv'd him true: For the same Malice soon may slander you. When your next Neighbour's House is all a Flame, If you neglect it, your's will be the same. Be never with that curious Itch possess'd, Of tearing Secrets from Another's Breast: But when imparting Friendship makes 'em thine, Revere, and guard them, as a sacred Shrine, By Frowns not frighted, nor betray'd by Wine. Delights to which thy private Fancy bends, Esteem, with due Submission to thy Friend's: Nor when he calls to hunt, the Sport refuse, And stay at Home to trifle with the Muse. Read learned Authors, study well the Wise, And ponder all the Methods they advise, To make thy Days in pleasing Quiet roll; Lest carking Avarice disturb thy Soul, Or Terrors shake, or Cares thy Mind abuse, Or anxious Hope for Things of little Use. Consider whether Virtue be produc'd By Education, or from Heav'n infus'd: What lessens Care: what makes a Man to be His own best Friend: whence pure Tranquility Results, from Honour, or from shining Wealth, Or from a private Life, led as it were by Stealth.— Creech alter'd. Hor. Epist. XVIII. Lib. 1. Advice to a Prince. Dear Youth, if Fortune on the Parthian Throne Had fix'd thy Lot: if from the great Arsaces Descended lineally, and much rever'd Far thro' the distant East, the bright Tiara Shone round thy Brows; then might thy princely Rank And high Extraction render Thee secure, Tho' wantoning in slothful Luxury. But diff'rent much the Case of those that wield The Roman Scepter: Virtue, here, not Blood, Must fix thy Fame: when exercis'd by Power 'Tis then most great, most useful to Mankind. Tho' thy wide stretch'd Dominions should extend To India's utmost Bounds, tho' down to Thee The Mede, the Arab, and the Persian bow, If thy Desires are wicked, if by Fear Or Anger Thou art sway'd, Thou'rt but a Slave; And in thy Breast shalt feel the Tyrant's Pow'r. Then only art Thou fit to wield the Scepter, When Thou canst rule Thyself. Vice still proceeds From bad to worse: Licentiousness leads on To Luxury, and that to lawless Lust. Most difficult the Task to practice Chastity, When the hot Blood boils high; and Anger, then, But ill advises, when Revenge is near. Thou, the first Sallies in thy Bosom quell, Nor e'er be thy Concern what 'tis Thou canst, But what Thou ought'st to do: and the Regard Of what is just, let always rule thy Will. But this I o'er and o'er again advise, That Thou remember Providence has plac'd Thee In the full Point of Light; where all Thou do'st By every Nation round Thee is observ'd. The Faults of Princes ne'er can be conceal'd: The Splendor of their elevated Rank Permits not ought they do to be unknown: Fame enters their most hidden Privacy, And searches all the secret Windings out. Be gentle and benevolent to all: We may in every Excellence beside By Others be outdone, but Clemency Exalts and makes us equal to the Gods. Act not a double Part, nor, false Thyself, Give Ear to Rumours; for who-e'er does so, Shall be affrighted at each idle Noise, And, never, never know an Hour's Peace. Whom Men at Arms and glittering Spears surround, Is much less safe than he that Love defends: But Love can ne'er be forc'd:—This, mutual Trust, This, kind and gracious Acts alone, procure. Whom all his People fear, himself much more Must be afraid: a Fate for Tyrants fit. Let such with Envy persecute all those Whom Fame speaks well of, and destroy the Brave. With Swords and Poisons let them live encompass'd, Immur'd in Tow'rs, and trembling while they threat. But Thou a Citizen, a Father be; The general Good consulting, not thine own, Still, still prefer the Public to Thyself. If Thou wouldst have thine Edicts well observ'd, Obey them first Thyself: the People, then, With Readiness comply, when the Law-maker, Himself, they find, observant of the Laws. Example in a King is all in all: The Statues of the Realm, serve less to form His Subjects Manners, than the Life he leads: For still the changeful Vulgar ape their Prince.— Claud. 4. Cons. Hon. ÆTNA. —Ætna thunders nigh In dreadful Ruins. With a Whirlwind's Force Sometimes it throws to Heav'n a pitchy Cloud, Redden'd with Cinders, and involv'd in Smoke: And tosses Balls of Flame, and licks the Stars. Sometimes with loud Explosion high it hurls The Rocks, and Entrails from the Mountain torn: With roaring Noise slings molten Stones in Air, And boils, and bellows, from its lowest Caves. 'Tis said the Bulk of huge Enceladus Blasted with Lightning, by this pondrous Mount Is crush'd: and Ætna, o'er him whelm'd, expires Flame from it's burst Volcanos: and when e'er He shifts his weary Side, Trinacria all Groans trembling, and with Smoke obscures the Sky.— Trap. Æn. Lib. III. Far stretching it's burnt Rocks, is Æna found; Ætna for vanquish'd Gyants still renown'd: Enceladus's Load; who crush'd beneath, From his huge Breast does burning Tempests breathe. Still as the Monster, weary of the Weight, Exchanges Sides, he shakes the Mountain's Height: Sicilia heaves, and ev'ry tott'ring Wall Leans toward the Ground, and meditates a Fall. It's pointed Summits from afar are shewn, But are accessible to Sight alone. While on it's other Parts fresh Greens appear, And Groves of Trees their shady Branches rear, No hardy Hind dares turn the sultry Soil On the high Crown, and cultivate with Toil. For now black Clouds and Tempests force their Way, And with their loathsome Pitch pollute the Day: Now massy Fragments of the shiver'd Stone, Torn from it's Root, against the Stars are thrown. But tho' the Burnings rage to such Excess, Still with the Snows they hold a faithful Peace. Here hoary Winter does her Seat maintain, Secure of Thaws, and unmolested reign: Thick Clouds of Smoke hang o'er the freezing Coast, And the swift Flames sweep harmless o'er the Frost. What forceful Engines whirl aloft in Air The craggy Quarries, and the Mountain tare? From what strange Source proceeds the burning Stream, Which on the wasted Vallies spouts the Flame?— Or in Confinement choak'd, th'imprison'd Wind Pushes around an open Vent to find, And, in it's Course resisted by the Rock, Bursts thro' it's Prison with a mighty Shock: Or the Sea, ent'ring thro' the sulph'rous Veins, Boils with the Fires, and on the blasted Plains Displodes the mingled Ruin: wildly thrown, The Stones and liquid Flames pour with Destruction down. Hughes. Claud. Rapt. Pros. Affection Filial. Then Jason thus his Medea. Spouse address'd, O, Wife! To whom I stand indebted for my Life: Whose Tenderness and boundless Favours prove, How much Thou art a Miracle of Love: If Magick can:—what cannot that surmount? O! take some needless Years from my Account, And to my Father's Life the Number place: He spoke: and as he spoke the Tears bedew'd his Face.— Sewell. Ovid. Met. VII. —Now The Fire more loudly roars: and, from the Walls The blazing Torrent nearer rolls the Flames. Haste then, dear Father! on my Shoulders lay Your aged Body: I the Load will bear, Nor think that Labour hard: whatever Chance Betides us, Both shall share one common Fate, Escape together, or together fall.— Trap. Virg. Æn. II. —Yet more than all Rewards, and Prizes, one Thing I implore: I have a Mother, from the ancient Race Of Priam sprung: whose Fondness for her Son, Urg'd her, unhappy, thro' the Toils of War To follow me: nor could the Ilian Coasts Detain her, nor the King Acestes' Walls. Her, ignorant of whate'er Fate impends, Unbless'd, and unsaluting, I forsake: This Night, and thy Right Hand, I here attest, I cannot bear my wretched Parent's Tears. But Thou, I beg, console her helpless Age, And aid her desolate: of that secure, With less Concern shall I all Hazards run.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. IX. Æneas, glad to see the Mezentius. Tuscan's Blood, Snatches his Fauchion from his Thigh with Haste, And darts impetuous on his trembling Foe. This Lausus saw: and struck with Fear and Grief, For his lov'd Father by such Danger press'd, Groan'd deep: and Tears ran trickling down his Cheeks. The Sire, retreating, useless for the Fight, And with his Wound disabled, back withdrew: And in his Target trail'd the hostile Spear. The Youth springs on amidst the thickest Arms, Himself opposing to Æneas' Sword Rais'd high, and ready to discharge the Blow.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. X. Affection Conjugal. See Constancy. The King commands his Servants to their Arms, Resolv'd to go: but the loud Noise alarms His lovely Queen, who from her Chamber flew, And her half-plaited Hair behind her threw: About his Neck she hung with loving Fears, And now with Words, and now with pleading Tears, Intreated that he'd send his Men alone, And stay Himself to save two Lives in one.— Croxall. Ovid. Met. XI. Orpheus.He, with his concave Shell his pining Love Consol'd: and lonely, on the desart Shore, Thee, sweet Eurydice! Thee still he sung: Thee, at the Op'ning, Thee at Close of Day.— No proffer'd Loves, no Hymenéal Vows Could move his Soul: The Hyperborean Ice, And snowy Tanais, and th' extended Fields For ever rigid with Riphæan Frost, Alone He travell'd o'er: Eurydice Ravish'd away, deploring.— The Thracian Dames enrag'd by this Contempt, At Bacchus' Orgies, and nocturnal Rites, With furious Madness tore the hapless Youth, And strew'd his mangled Carcass o'er the Plains. Then too, his Head, from the fair Neck disjoyn'd, Œgrian Hebrus in his gulphy Tide Rolling along, Eurydice he call'd, With his last Accents, and his dying Tongue: Ah! poor Eurydice! his flying Breath, Eurydice! the Stream, and Banks resound.— Trap. Virg. Geor. Lib IV. The Four Ages of the WORLD. The Golden Age. First Age. The Golden Age was first: when Man yet new, No Rule but uncorrupted Reason knew: And, with a native Bent, did Good pursue. Unforc'd by Punishment, un-aw'd by Fear, His Words were simple, and his Soul sincere. Needless was written Law, where none oppress'd; The Law of Man was written in his Breast. No suppliant Crowds before the Judge appear'd, No Court erected yet, nor Cause was heard: But all was safe, for Conscience was their Guard. The Mountain Pine, unfell'd, securely stood, Nor chang'd for distant Seas her native Wood. Then Mortals, unambitious, knew no more Than the short Prospect of their native Shore. No Walls were yet: nor Fence, nor Moat, nor Mound: Nor Drum was heard, nor Trumpet's warlike Sound: Nor Sword, nor Helm was made: in calm Content, And downy Peace, their Lives these happy People spen. The teeming Earth yet guiltless of the Plow, And unprovok'd, did fruitful Stores allow: Content with Food, which Nature freely bred, On Wildings, and on Strawberries they fed: Cornels and Bramble Berries gave the rest, And fallen Acorns furnish'd out a Feast. On Flow'rs unsown soft Zephyr spread his Wing, And Time itself was one eternal Spring. In following Years, the bearded Corn ensu'd, From Earth untill'd, nor was that Earth renew'd. Streams, then, of Milk, and Streams of Nectar flow'd, And yellow Honey sweating Oaks bestow'd.— Dryden alter'd. Ov. Met. Lib. I. Then Men were hard, as hard as parent Stones, And built on bigger and on firmer Bones: The Nerves that join'd their Limbs were tough and strong, Their Life was healthy, and their Age was long. No Colds, nor Heats, nor dire Diseases bred By dainty Dishes, multiply'd the Dead: But rolling Years long found them in their Prime, And, like the Brutes, in Search of Food they spent their Time. No brawny Plowman then had learn'd to tare The Earth's firm Surface with the crooked Share: None prun'd old Branches from the Trees that grew, Or dug the fruitful Ground for planting new: But all were well contented with the Store Sun, Rain, and Earth bestow'd, and wish'd no more. In Woods they liv'd, on Acorns chiefly fed, And such wild Berries as in Winter, red, Become mature: the youthful World then gave Of these abundance more than now we have; And various Fruits beside did then produce, Amply sufficient for poor Mortals' Use.— Geech alter'd. Lucr. Lib. V. —Then none resign'd Their Lives to Seas, or Wishes to the Wind: Confin'd their Search: they knew themselves alone, And thought That only worthy to be known.— Manil. Lib. I. That ancient Time, we call the Golden-Age, Was happy: when Earth's Fruits, and wholsom Herbs, Were Man's delicious Food; e'er he with Blood His Lips polluted.—Safely thro' the Air The Bird then wing'd his Way: then o'er the Plains The Hare securely wander'd, void of Fear: Nor did his Confidence the Fish betray, Or guileful Hooks ensnare.—All, then, sincere, And unsuspicious, perfect Peace enjoy'd.— Ovid. Met. Lib. XV. Those Woods were first the Seat of Sylvan Pow'rs, Of Nymphs, and Fawns, and savage Men, who took Their Birth from Trunks of Trees, and stubborn Oak: Nor Laws they knew, nor Manners, nor the Care Of lab'ring Oxen, nor the shining Share: Nor Arts of Gain, nor what they gain'd to spare. Their Exercise the Chace: the running Flood Supply'd their Thirst: The Trees supply'd their Food. Then Saturn came, who fled the Pow'r of Jove, Robb'd of his Realms, and banish'd from above. The Men dispersed on Hills, to Towns he brought: And Laws ordain'd, and civil Customs taught. With his mild Empire Peace and Plenty came, And hence the Golden Times deriv'd their Name.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. VIII. Thus Saturn flourished in an Age of Gold, On Earth: nor Mortals yet had heard th' Alarms Of Trumpets, nor the sputt'ring of the Steel On Anvils form'd, and hammer'd into Swords.— Id. Virg. Geor. Lib. II. How happy liv'd Mankind in Saturn's Days! E'er tiresom Journeys mark'd out tedious Ways: No Ship then ventur'd on the azure Main, Or spread its Sails the speeding Winds to gain: To Coasts unknown then none a Voyage made, Or stor'd their Vessels with a foreign Trade. No sturdy Bull as yet had wore the Yoke, No Horse with Bit and Bridle yet was broke. No Doors their Houses had: and in their Grounds No Stone was fix'd, to mark each Tenant's Bounds. Oaks Honey gave, and of their own Accord The Ewes with swelling Dugs their Milk afford. Armies, nor Rage, nor Wars, as yet were found, Nor yet the cruel Smith had Weapons forg'd to wound.— Tibul. Lib. I. Eleg. 3. Silver Age. But when good Saturn, banish'd from above, Was driv'n to Hell, the World was under Jove. Succeeding Times a Silver Age behold, Excelling Brass, but more excell'd by Gold. Then Summer, Winter, Autumn did appear: And Spring was but a Season of the Year. The Sun his annual Course obliquely made, Good Days contracted, and enlarg'd the bad. Then glow'd the Air with sultry Heats, the Wind Began with Ice and Snow the Rains to bind. Mortals to Houses then for Shelter fled: Caves were their Houses, or an Osier-Shed. Then Furrows for the quick'ning Grain were broke, And Oxen labour'd first beneath the Yoke.— Dryden alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. I. E'er Jove was King no Hinds subdu'd the Glebe: Nor lawful was it held to sever Lands, Or mark their Bounds: in common all Things lay: And Earth without Compulsion yielded Food.— He baneful Poyson to fell Serpents gave: Commanded Wolves to prowl, the Sea to toss: From Trees the Honey shook: conceal'd the Fire: And all in Streams repress'd the running Wine: That Want by Thought might strike out various Arts, Gradual; in Furrows seek the Blade of Corn: And by Collision from the Veins of Flint Extund the latent Fire.—Then Rivers first Felt hollow'd Timber: the sea-faring Crew Then first gave Names and Numbers to the Stars, The Pleïads, Hyads, and the northern Bear. 'Twas then invented to intangle Beasts In Toils, and Fowls in Bird-lime to deceive: And with stanch Hounds the Thicket to inclose. One with his Casting-net, lanch'd on the deep, Beats the broad River: from the deeper Sea Another drags along his dropping Twine. Then rigid Iron, and the grating Saw, (With Wedges, first, the splitting Wood they riv'd) Then various Arts ensu'd.— Trap. Virg. Georg. Lib. I. Brazen Age. Third in Succession came the Brazen Age: A warlike Offspring, prompt to bloody Rage, But yet not impious.— Dryden alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. I. Iron Age. —Hard Steel succeeded then, And stubborn as the Metal were the Men. Truth, Modesty, and Shame, the World forsook; Fraud, Avarice, and Force, their Places took. Then Sails were spread to ev'ry Wind that blew, Raw were the Sailors, and the Depths were new: Trees that long rooted on the Mountains stood, Now bounded o'er the deep unpractis'd Flood. Then Land-marks limited to each his Right: For all before was common as the Light. Nor was the Ground alone required to bear Her annual Income to the crooked Share, But greedy Mortals, rummaging her Store, Digg'd from her Entrails first the precious Oar, Which next to Hell the prudent Gods had laid: And that alluring Ill to Sight display'd. Then cursed Steel, and more accursed Gold, Gave Mischief Birth, and made that Mischief bold: The fatal Parents they of new Alarms, Give Birth to War, and fill the World with Arms. Now Men are broken loose from moral Bands, And brandish'd Weapons glitter in their Hands. No Rights of Hospitality remain: The Guest by him who harbour'd him is slain. The Son-in-law pursues the Father's Life, Brothers with their own Brothers are at Strife, The Wife her Husband murders, he the Wife: The Stepdame Poyson for the Son prepares, The Son inquires into his Father's Years: Duty and Piety expiring lye, And Justice, last of all, soars to her native Sky, Leaving the Earth defil'd with Blood and Cruelty. Ovid. Met. Lib. I. Golden Age Restor'd. The mighty The great Platonick Year. Round of Years again revolv'd, The Virgin now, and Saturn's Reign return: And a new Offspring from high Heav'n descends. Beneath thy Sway the Relicks of our Guilt (If such be still remaining) quite effac'd Shall from all future Terrors free the World. Kindly, to Thee, sweet Infant, shall the Earth, Yield her first Presents, by no Culture forc'd: The wand'ring Ivy, and soft Violet, The smiling Crocus, and the blushing Rose. The Goats spontaneous homewards shall return, Their Teats with Milk distended: and the Herds Unterrify'd by monstrous Lions, feed. The Serpent too shall die: the fraudful Herbs Of noxious Poison wither, and decay: And Syrian Spices bloom o'er all the World. Ripe yellow Harvests on the Fields shall wave, The savage Brambles blush with pendant Grapes, And Honey from hard Oaks in Dew distil. The Sailor shall renounce the Sea; no Ships Traffick exchange: All Lands shall all Things bear. No Glebe shall feel the Harrow's Teeth, no Vine The Pruning hook: The sturdy Village-Hind Shall then release his Oxen from the Yoke: Nor chang'd by Art shall various Wool belye It's native Colour: but in Pastures green The Ram himself with Purples glossy Hue, Or Crocus' yellow Teint shall tinge his Fleece: And unforc'd Crimson cloath the feeding Lambs.— Trap. Virg. Ecl. IV. —The last great Day is come, When Earth, and all her impious Sons, shall lye Crush'd in the Ruins of the falling Sky: Whence fresh shall rise, her newborn Realms to grace, A pious Offspring and a purer Race: Such as e'er-while in Golden Ages sprung, When Saturn govern'd, and the World was young.— Addison. Senec. Herc. Œt. Act. II. Ages of Man Characteriz'd. The Boy, who newly has to Speech attain'd, And just can go without his Nurse's Hand, To play with those of his own Growth is pleas'd, Soon is enrag'd, and is as soon appeas'd: Changeful his Humour, various is his Will, To nothing fix'd, but fluctuating still. The beardless Youth, just from his Tutor freed, Sports with his Dogs, and sounds his Courser's Speed: Yielding, as Wax, to each alluring Vice: Resty to those that would his Faults chastise: Careless of Profit, lavish in Expence, Headstrong, and proud, and given up to Sense: Whate'er he fancies eager to attain, And hasty to relinquish it again. With diff'rent Thoughts to sober Manhood grown, He seeks for Wealth, and Friendship, and Renown: Becomes discreet, and cautious how to act What he must after alter, or retract. With num'rous Ills the Old is round beset: Fearful to spend, but covetous to get: Full of Delays, and Hopes, and Love of Ease, Greedy of Life, morose, and hard to please: On Youth's gay Frolicks peevishly severe, But Oh! when he was young, what Times they were! Hor. de Art. Poet. Ages of several Creatures. The utmost Age to Man the Gods assign Are Winters three times Two, and ten times Nine. Poor Man nine times the prating Daws exceed: Three times the Daw the Deer's more lasting Breed: The Deer full thrice the Raven's Race out-run: Nine times the Raven Titan's feather'd Son: Beyond his Age, with Youth and Beauty crown'd, The Hamadryads shine ten Ages round: Their Breath the longest is the Fates bestow, And such the Bounds to mortal Lives below. Addison. Auson. Edyl. 18. Hesiodion. Agriculture. —The Sire of Gods himself Will'd not that Tillage should be free from Toil. He first sollicited the restive Mold By Art: and whetted mortal Wit with Cares, Permitting not his Reign to rust with Sloth.— Trap. Virg. Georg. I. With piercing Steel to turn the stubborn Land Propitious Ceres Mortals first ordain'd; When scanty Food the sacred Groves supply'd, And all Relief Dodonean Oaks deny'd: But soon new Toil the foodful Glebe requir'd, Eat with an evil Rust the Grain expir'd: Fierce in the Field the lazy Thistle stood, And Burrs, and Brambles rose, a cruel Wood! Darnel unblest the shining Plain o'erspreads, And high exalt the fruitless Oats their Heads. So that unless with unextinguish'd Toil Of lab'ring Harrows, you pursue the Soil, Fright off the Birds, and thin the shady Plain, And with repeated Vows call down the Rain: Ah! bootless on another's Heap you'll look, And comfort Hunger with the shaken Oak.— Anonym. Ibid. In early Spring, when from the whitening Hills The gentle Moisture silently distills: When crumbling to the Zephyrs falls the Soil: Then, let my Bullock groan beneath his Toil: Deep let the Plough within the Surface wear, And polish'd with the Furrow shine the Share: Those Plains, at last, the Peasant's Hopes compleat, Which twice the Cold have felt, and twice the Heat: Burst were the Barns with their luxuriant Freight.— Id. Ibid. —Let the vig'rous Steer Turn the rich Furrow in the new-born Year: And Summer's Heat with rip'ning Suns pursue The sluggish Glebe, and all the Clod subdue. But if not fat the Soil, it will suffice, When bright Arcturus mounts the purple Skies, To skin the Surface with a gentle Share, And lift the Furrow lightly to the Air: There, lest the Weeds the smiling Blade withstand; Lest Moisture, here, desert the barren Sand.— Id. Ibid. It profits oft to fire the fruitless Ground, And thirsty Stubble crackling all around: Whether from thence by Nature's secret Laws, Fresh Nourishment the Earth and Vigour draws: Or that the latent Vice is purg'd by Heat, And the redundant Humours waste in Sweat: Or that the Flames unusual Tracks explore, Relax the Grit, and open every Pore: Whence genial Moisture hastens through the Earth, Slides to the Root, and cheers the tender Birth: Or that the Heat the hollow Glebe constrains, Braces each Nerve, and knits the gaping Veins: Lest piercing Wet, or the swift Pow'r of Day More fierce, or freezing Boreas urge his Way.— Id. Ibid. Much too he helps the Field, who every Clod With Harrows breaks, and drags the Hurdle's Load: Nor e'er on him, with an ungracious Eye, Looks yellow Ceres from the lofty Sky, Who, the rough Backs he slices from the Plain Assails oblique, and thorow cuts again, And plies the Soil, and makes the Furrow yield Tame to the Coulter, and commands the Field.— Id. Ibid. The Solstice moist, serene the Winter Sky, For this, ye Swains, intreat the Pow'rs on high. When Winter Dust by driving Winds is born, Glad is the Glebe, most wondrous glad the Corn.— Id. Ibid. When Libra weighs the Hours of Toil and Night, And parts alike the Globe to Shades and Light: Then in the Field, ye vig'rous Swains appear, Put forth your Strength, and exercise the Steer: Sow hardy Grains: the miry Task perform To Winter's last impracticable Storm. Then is the proper Time to cover o'er Or Ceres' Poppy, or the flaxen Store: Nor should the Harrow's Labour ever end, Whilst dry the Glebe, whilst Clouds as yet impend.— Id. Ibid. Alarm. See Amazement. Lo! rushing thro' the Court with frantick Haste A Messenger with Terror fills the Town: Relates, that in Array of Battel rang'd The Trojan and the Tyrrhene Troops descend From Tyber's Stream, and cover all the Plain. Forthwith their Minds with stimulating Rage Are stung, confus'd: to Arms! to Arms! they cry: The madding Multitude, and warrior Youth Together rove: the pensive Fathers weep, And murmur unresolv'd: to Heav'n ascends, Loud, and confus'd, the clam'rous Discontent.— Strait to the Works from all the City round They croud.— Other dig Trenches deep before the Gates, And roll vast Stones, and Palisadoes fix: The Trumpet with shrill Clangor to the Fight The bloody signal Sounds: the Dames, and Boys, In a promiscuous Throng the Ramparts crown.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. XI. Mean-while, with Cries confus'd the Walls resound: The Noise grows loud, and th' undistinguish'd Din Of clashing Arms rolls nearer. Rous'd from Sleep, I gain the Summit of the high built House: And stand with list'ning Ears. As when a Flame Invades a Field of Corn by driving Winds: Or, rushing from the Hills, a rapid Flood Lays flat the Product of the Plains, lays flat The rising Crop, and Labours of the Plough, And with a sweeping Torrent whirls the Woods: On a high Rock the doubtful Peasant stands Amaz'd, and in his Ear receives the Sound.— Trap. Æn. Lib. II. With hasty March by Night his Troops he led. To the mid Forum on the Soldier pass'd, There halted, and his Victor Ensigns plac'd: With dire Alarm from Band to Band around, The Fife, hoarse Horn, and rattling Trumpets sound. The starting Citizens uprear their Heads: The lustier Youth leap frighted from their Beds: Hasty they snatch the Weapons, which among Their Houshold Gods in Peace had rested long: Old Bucklers of the cov'ring Hides bereft, The mould'ring Frames disjoyn'd, and barely left: Swords, with foul Rust indented deep, they take: And useless Spears, with Points inverted, shake.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. I. Alps. Upon the tow'ring Alps sublimest Height, Where the cragg'd Rocks look down upon the Clouds, A Grecian Altar to Alcides smokes. There everlasting Winter bars Access, And the ambitious Summit props the Skies: No Summer here e'er darts his genial Beams, Nor vernal Zephyrs chear the joyless Air: But Snows on Snows accumulated rise, The icy Pillar of the starry Orb.— Addison junr. Petron. Arb. Amazement. See Alarm. To Him the Wind with doubtful Terror wafts The mingled Noise: hoarse Murmurs of Distress, And Clamours from the City pierce his Ears. Ah me! what Sounds confus'd, what Cries disturb The Town? Why rush these Clamours from the Walls? He said: and, with his Courser's Reins repress'd In dumb Amaze stood list'ning.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. XII. Confounded with the Crowd of various Thoughts, And stiff'ning with Amaze, the Hero stood, In Silence deep: within his Bosom boils Disdainful Shame, and Grief to Madness wrought, And Love inflam'd with Rage, and conscious Worth.— Trap. Ibid. The astonish'd Phaeton. Youth, where e'er his Eyes could turn, Beheld the Universe around him burn: The World was in a Blaze: nor could he bear The sultry Vapours, and the scorching Air, Which from below, as from a Furnace flow'd: And now the Axle-tree beneath him glow'd. Lost in the whirling Clouds that round him broke, And white with Ashes, hov'ring in the Smoke, He flew where-e'er the Horses drove, nor knew Whither the Horses drove, or where he flew.— Addison. Ovid. Met. Lib. II. Amazon. Her Amazonian Files with lunar Shields Penthesilea leads, and in the midst Of Thousands Storms: Beneath her naked Pap Her golden Belt she buckles, warlike Maid, And, tho' a Virgin, dares engage with Men.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. I. Here in the Brakes, and savage Dens of Beasts, He nurs'd his Daughter from the Dugs of Mares, Milking their Teats into her tender Lips. Soon as the Infant first with doubtful Feet Could press the Ground, her little Hands he fill'd With pointed Darts, and on her Shoulder hung A Bow and Quiver. No soft Caul of Gold Her Tresses strains: nor flows her waving Gown: Instead of these a Tyger's horrid Hide Hangs from her Head, and o'er her Back descends. Darts with her tender Hand e'en then she threw; And, whirling round her Head a sounding Sling, Struck the Strymonian Crane, or Snow-white Swan.— Trap. Æn. Lib. XI. —Camilla came, And led her warlike Troops, a Warrior Dame: Unbred to Spinning, in the Loom unskill'd, She chose the nobler Pallas of the Field. Mix'd with the First, the fierce Virago fought, Sustain'd the Toils of Arms, the Danger sought: Outstrip'd the Winds in Speed upon the Plain, Flew o'er the Fields, nor hurt the bearded Grain: She swept the Seas, and as she skimm'd along Her flying Feet unbath'd on Billows hung. Men, Boys, and Women, stupid with Surprize, Where-e'er she passes, fix their wondring Eyes: Longing they look, and gaping at the Sight, Devour her o'er and o'er with vast Delight. Her purple Habit sits with such a Grace On her smooth Shoulders, and so suits her Face: Her Head with Ringlets of her Hair is crown'd, And in a golden Caul the Curls are bound. She shakes her Myrtle Jav'lin: And, behind, Her Lycian Quiver dances in the Wind.— Dryden. Æn. Lib. VII. But in the Midst the Amazonian Maid Camilla, with her shafts, and Quiver storms, Exulting, fierce among the slaughter'd Heaps: With one Breast bare commodious for the Fight, Now hurls repeated Jav'lins, now with Toil Unweary'd snatches her well temper'd Ax. Her gilded Bow, and all Diana's Arms Sound from her Shoulder. Ev'n, when turn'd in Flight, (If e'er she turn) her Arrows she directs Shot backward, and behind her bends the Bow.— Trap. Æn. Lib. XI. —With dissembled Flight In a wide Ring, interior, wheeling round She mocks Orsilochus, and him pursues, From whom she flies: Then rising to the Blows Redoubled, thro' his Arms and Bones she drives Her massy Ax, nor ought regards his Pray'rs: From the warm Wound his Brains besmear his Face.— Trap. Ibid. Such the fair Troop of Amazons is seen With moony Shields, and headed by their Queen: When trembling Tanais has their Fury try'd, Or the fierce Getes their female Arms defy'd: And proudly glitt'ring with their plunder'd Spoils, The fierce Viragoes march, triumphant from their Toils.— Hughes. Claud. Rapt. Pros. Ambassador. An Attic Vessel reach'd the friendly Shore, Which Cephalus was sent Ambassador from the Athenians, to Æacus King of Ægina, to demand Assistance against Minos King of Crete. Cephalus, his Country's Envoy, bore. The Sons of Æacus the Hero knew, Tho' long remov'd and absent from their View. Their Hands they join, in close Embraces meet, And lead him to their royal Father's Seat.— The Hero much remaining Beauty held, (In Youth for Beauty greatly he excell'd:) And ent'ring, bore the Olive in his Hand, The precious Product of his native Land. On either Side, from heav'nly Pallas sprung, Young Clytus, and young Buten march along. First Salutations o'er, the Chief relates His Embassy, from the Athenian States, And Succour asks: insisting on the Ties Of Leagues, and Friendship, with their old Allies: The general Danger too he shews, to wake Their Fears, and his Address successful make. For timely Aid, his Country's just Pretence, He pleaded thus, with artful Eloquence. The King reply'd (his Scepter in his Hand,) Our Help, Athenians, ask not, but command: Your own you may this Island's Forces call, For in your Cause I will adventure all: Nor Armies do I want, that can oppose My own Invaders, and repel your Foes.— Sewel alter'd. Ovid. Met. VII. Then Prince Æneas sends from every Rank An hundred chos'n Ambassadors, dispatched To the Imperial Walls, with Olive Boughs All wreath'd to bear his Presents to the King, And sue for Peace.— And now, their destin'd Journey having pass'd, Th' Ambassadors beheld the Latin Towers, And lofty Palaces, and reach'd the Walls. —To the aged Monarch's Ears, Swift on his Steed, a Messenger relates, That Men of awful Port, in foreign Garb, Were moving towards the Walls: He gives Command To call them to the Court, and in the Midst Sits lofty on th' hereditary Throne. —Enthron'd On his paternal Seat, Latinus calls The Trojans to his Presence in the Court: And Thus with pleasing Accent first began. Tell us, ye Trojans, (for your Name and Race Are not to Us unknown, nor come You here Unheard of:) say, what seek You? or what Cause Has urg'd your Navy to th' Ausonian Shore Thro' such a Space of Ocean? Whether driv'n By Error of the Way, or Stress of Storms, (Variety of Perils on the Deep, Obvious to Mariners,) You enter here Our River's Mouth, and rest within the Port. Fly not our Hospitality: nor judge Erroneous of the Latins, Saturn's Race: Just of themselves, without Restraint, or Laws, And by th' Example of their ancient God. He spoke; and thus Ilioneus reply'd. O King! from Faunus' Blood illustrious sprung: Neither by stormy Billows hither toss'd, Nor by the Stars, or Shores unknown, deceiv'd, Arrive we on your Confines: With Design, And willing Minds this City We approach. A little Mansion for our Country-Gods, And safe from Danger a Retreat We ask, And Air, and Water, common Gifts to All. On your Dominions nothing of Disgrace Shall We reflect: nor small will be your Fame: Nor shall by length of Time the grateful Sense Of such an Obligation be effac'd: Nor shall the Ausonian Nation e'er repent To have receiv'd the Trojans.— Some Gifts, besides, preserv'd from burning Troy, The little Relicks of his former State, Our Prince presents You. In this Gold his Sire Anchises at the Altars sacrific'd: These, By the Rite accustom'd, giving Laws To the assembled Nations, Priam wore: This Scepter, this Tiara, and these Robes, The Labour of the Trojan Dames.— So spake Ilioneus. Latinus fix'd, Sits in one Posture, musing, on the Ground Rolling his Eyes intent.—At length replies: —Trojan, what Thou ask'st Is granted: nor your Gifts do I refuse: While King Latinus reigns, You shall not want The fertile Glebe, and Opulence of Troy. Let ev'n Æneas (if he so desires Our Friendship and Alliance) hither come, Nor shun the Interview: to me 'twill prove A Pledge of Peace, to touch that Monarch's Hand. Thus having said, the aged King selects From all his Number chosen Steeds: There stood Three hundred shining in their lofty Stalls: To all the Trojans he commands to lead The wingy-footed Coursers, cover'd o'er With rich embroidered Crimson: Down their Breasts Hang golden Collars: and adorn'd with Gold They champ the yellow Gold between their Teeth. Next to the absent Trojan Prince he sends A Chariot, and its harness'd Pair, of Breed Celestial, from their Nostrils snorting Fire. Thus with the Gifts and Speeches of the King, Th' Ambassadors, high on their stately Steeds, Return exulting, and report the Peace.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. VII. And now from King Latinus' Court arriv'd Ambassadors, with Olive Branches wreath'd, And Grace imploring: that he would permit The Corps, which slain in Battle, o'er the Field Lay scatter'd, to be quietly interr'd: War with the Dead he wag'd not: Let him spare A Nation, once by hospitable Tyes, And plighted Spousals, to himself ally'd. Them good Æneas, and their Suit so just, Receives with gracious Air: and thus proceeds. What Fortune, unpropitious, undeserv'd, Plung'd You, ye Latins, in so deep a War, And urg'd You from our Friendship to decline? Peace to the Dead desire You? for the Corps Which fell in Battle by the Chance of Arms? Peace to the Living gladly would I grant.— Go You: and grace your Friends in Battle slain, With the last Rites, and fire their fun'ral-Piles.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. XI. Ambition. The Sisyphus is he, whom Noise and Strife Seduce from all the soft Retreats of Life: To vex the Government, disturb the Laws Drunk with the Fumes of popular Applause, He courts the giddy Crowd to make him great, And sweats, and toils in vain to mount the Sov'reign Seat. For still to aim at Pow'r, and still to fail, Ever to strive, and never to prevail, What is it, but, in Reason's true Account, To heave the Stone against the rising Mount: Which, urg'd, and labour'd, and forc'd up with Pain, Recoils, and rolls impetuous down, and smokes along the Plain.— Dryden. Lucret. Lib. III. But write him down a Slave, who humbly proud, With Presents begs Preferment from the Crowd: That early He who sued for any Office among the Romans, was called a Candidate, because he wore a white Gown, and sometimes chalked it to make it appear whiter. He rose early, and went to the Levees of those who headed the People, saluted also the Tribes severally, when they were gathered together to chuse their Magistrates: and distributed a Largess among them to gain their Voices: much resembling our Elections of Parliament-Men. —Dryden. Suppliant, who salutes the Tribes, And sets the Mob to scramble for his Bribes: That some old Dotard, sitting in the Sun, On Holidays may tell, that such a Feat was done.— Dryd. Pers. Lib. V. This Man delights, with haughty Pride, In publick at the Monarch's Side, In solemn State to pass along, Envy'd by all the gaping Throng: Vain Wretch! Ambition fires his Breast, Impetuous, dire, tormenting Guest!— Ward. Senec. Herc. Œt. The Spoils of War, brought to Feretrian Jove; An empty Coat of Armour hung above The Conqueror's Chariot, and in Triumph born; A Streamer, from a boarded Galley torn; A Chap fall'n Beaver loosely hanging by The cloven Helm: an Arch of Victory, On whose high Convex sits a captive Foe, And sighing casts a mournful Look below: Of ev'ry Nation, each illustrious Name, Such Toys as these have cheated into Fame: Exchanging solid Quiet, to obtain The windy Satisfaction of the Brain.— Dryden. Juv. X. One World suffic'd not Alexander's Mind, Coop'd up, he seem'd, in Earth and Seas confin'd: And, struggling, stretch'd his restless Limbs about The narrow Globe, to find a Passage out. Till enter'd the fam'd Babylon. Brick-built Town, he try'd The Tomb, and found it's strait Dimensions wide.— Dryd. Ibid. Pow'r and high Titles Men were fond to gain, As They could bring Content, or make a Chain To fix inconstant Fortune:—but in vain! For often those who climb'd the dang'rous Way, And reach'd the Pinnacle where Honours lay, Envy, like Lightning, tumbled headlong down, And in the Grave they sunk who wore the Crown: So that 'tis better safely to obey, Than sit on Thrones, and bear Imperial Sway.— Lucret.

Good Lord! they cry, what Ethiop Lips he has! How foul a Snout, and what a hanging Face! By Heav'n, I never could endure his Sight: But say, how came his monstrous Crimes to Light? What is the Charge, and who the Evidence?— Nothing at all of this; but Cæsar sent A blust'ring Letter to his Parliament. Nay, Sirs, if Cæsar writ, I ask no more, He's guilty: and the Question's out o' Door.— Dryden. Juv. Sat. X. Now, with Sejanus would'st Thou change thy Fate, To be, like him, first Minister of State? To have thy Levees crowded with Resort Of a depending, gaping, servile Court: Dispose all Honours of the Sword and Gown, Raise with a Nod, and ruin with a Frown: To hold thy Prince in Pupilage, and sway That Monarch whom the master'd World obey?— Yes, I believe Thou would'st be Great as He: For ev'ry Man's a Fool to that Degree, All wish the dire Prerogative to kill: Ev'n they would have the Pow'r who want the Will. But would'st Thou have thy Wishes understood, To take the Bad together with the Good? Would'st Thou not rather chuse the small Renown, To be the Mayor of some poor paltry Town, Bigly to look, and barb'rously to speak, To pound false Weights, and scanty Measures break, Than be Sejanus?— Dryden.

Spain first he won, the Pyrenœans past, And frozen Alps, the Mounds that Nature cast: And with corroding Juices, as he went, A Passage thro' the living Rocks he rent. Tho' Italy was conquer'd, and o'er-run: Uneasy still, he cry'd, There's nothing done, Till, level with the Ground their Gates are laid, And Punic Flags on Roman Tow'rs display'd.

Nor Swords at Hand, nor hissing Darts from far, Do Canna's Field avenge, and all the Rage of War: This Justice by a little Hannibal always carried Poyson in a hollow Ring, and therewith ended himself at last, lest he should fall into the Hands of his Enemies. This Ring is therefore call'd the Avenger of the Battle of Canna, where so many of the Roman Knights were slain, that Hannibal sent to Carthage three Measures of Gold Rings, taken from off their Fingers.

Who wants a Month, or ev'n a Year, may be Allow'd the Credit of Antiquity.

Tibul. Lib. I. El. 8. Banquet. See Hospitality. Rich as some Fane by lavish Zealots rear'd, For the proud Banquet, stood the Hall prepar'd: Thick golden Plates the latent Beams infold, And the high Roof was fretted o'er with Gold: Of solid Marble all the Walls were made, And Onyx ev'n the meaner Floor inlay'd: While Porphyry, and Agate, round the Court, In massy Columns rose, a proud Support. Of solid Ebony each Post was wrought, From swarthy Meroë profusely brought: With Iv'ry was the Entrance crusted o'er, And polish'd Tortoise hid each shining Door; While on the cloudy Spots enchas'd was seen The lively Em'ralds never-fading Green. Within, the royal Beds and Couches shone, Beamy and bright with many a costly Stone: In glowing Purple rich the Cov'rings lye: Twice had they drank the noblest Tyrian Dye: Others, as Pharian Artists have the Skill, To mix the parti-colour'd Web at Will, With winding Trails of various Silk were made, Where branching Gold set off the rich Brocade.— Around, of ev'ry Colour, Age, and Form, Huge Crowds, whole Nations of Attendants swarm: Some wait with yellow Rings of golden Hair, The vanquish'd Rhine shew'd Cæsar none so fair: Others were seen with swarthy frizled Heads, And Others Black, as Night's unchanging Shades. There too a hapless Train, by Steel unman'd, And soften'd from their Sex, a beardless Band! Stout comely Youths were plac'd in adverse Rows, Whose blooming Cheeks scarce the first Down disclose. The Princes round the Board recline in State, With mighty Cæsar, more than Princes great. What Earth, and Air, and Sea, and Nile afford, In golden Vessels heap the plenteous Board: What e'er ambitious Luxury could find Thro' the search'd Globe, and more than Want enjoyn'd; Variety of Birds, and Beasts of ev'ry Kind. Not ev'n the Gods are spar'd whom they adore. The Nile's sweet Wave capacious Christals pour, And Gems of Price, the Grape's delicious Store: No Growth of Mareotis' marshy Fields, But such as Meroë maturer yields: Where the warm Sun the racy Juice refines, And mellows into Age the infant Wines. With Wreaths of Nard the Guests their Temples bind, And blooming Roses of immortal Kind: Their dropping Locks with oily Odours flow, Recent, from near Arabia, where they grow: The vig'rous Spices breathe their strong Perfume, And the rich Vapour fills the spacious Room.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. X. The King once more the solemn Rites requires, And bids renew the Feasts, and wake the Fires. His Train obey, while all the Courts around With noisy Care, and various Tumult sound. Embroider'd Purple clothes the golden Beds: This Slave the Floor, and that the Table spreads: A Third dispels the Darkness of the Night, And fills depending Lamps with Beams of Light. These pile the Loaves in Canisters on high, And those in Flames the slaughter'd Victims fry. Sublime, in regal State, Adrastus shone, Stretch'd on rich Carpets, on his Iv'ry Throne: A lofty Couch receives each princely Guest: Around, at aweful Distance, wait the rest.— Pope. Stat. Theb. Lib. I. Battle. See Rout. Slaughter. Mean while the Trojan Squadron to the Town Approaches, and th' Etrurian Chiefs, and all The Army of the Horse, compos'd in Troops By certain Numbers rang'd:—o'er all the Field The bounding Coursers struggle with the Bit, Now This, now That Way turn'd, and neigh aloud: A Wood of Jav'lins rises: and the Plain Glows dreadful with the Iron Gleam of Arms. —The Latins on the Field Stand opposite: with Hands drawn back protend Their threat'ning Spears, and shake their brandish'd Darts. The Noise of trampling Feet, and neighing Steeds Burns in the Air, and nearer rolls the Fight. Now within Jav'lins Reach both Armies stood. Loud with a sudden Shout in Onset fierce They rush amain, and rouse their thund'ring Steeds: Thick as a Storm of Snow their Arrows pour, And darken all the Sky— Forthwith the Lines disorder'd croud: And turn'd In Flight, the Latins cast their Shields behind, And spur their smoking Horses to the Town. The Trojans urge the Chace: Asylas Chief Leads on the Troops: They now approach'd the Gates: The Latins in their Turn, with deaf'ning Shout, Wheel round their Steeds, and bend their pliant Necks: The Trojans fly, and slack the waving Reins. Twice to their Walls the Tuscans drove in Flight The Rutuli: Twice, cover'd with their Shields, Themselves look back, and see the Foes pursue. But when, engaging in the third Assault, All Battle joyn'd, and Man to Man oppos'd: Then dying Groans are heard: and drown'd in Gore Arms, Bodies, gasping Steeds, and slaughter'd Men Promiscuous roll:—a rigid Fight ensues.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. XI. All with their utmost Force exerted strive: Nor Pause, nor Respite: with vast Conflict fierce They push, and sweat, and labour o'er the Field— Id. Æn. Lib. XII. —As in War, The long extended Legion forms in Lines It's Cohorts: when the marshall'd Squadrons stand In the wide Plain: and, the whole Army rang'd, The Ground all fluctuates with the brazen Gleam: Nor yet in horrid Shock the Battle joins, But Mars, uncertain, hovers o'er the Field.— Id. Virg. Georg. II. And now, the fainting Stars at length gave Way, And hid their vanquish'd Fires in beamy Day: When round their Leader's Tent the Legions croud, And, urg'd by Fate, demand the Fight aloud. Wretches! that long their little Life to waste, And hurry on those Hours that fly too fast! Too soon, for thousands, shall the Day be done, Whose Eyes no more shall see the setting Sun!— Loud thro' the Camp the rising Murmurs sound, And one tumultuous Hurry runs around: Sudden their busy Hearts began to beat, And each pale Visage wore the Marks of Fate. And now the Warriors all with busy Care, Whet the dull Sword, and point the blunted Spear: With tougher Nerves they string the bended Bow, And in full Quivers steely Shafts bestow: The Horseman sees his Furniture made fit, Sharpens the Spur, and burnishes the Bit: Fixes the Rein to check, or urge his Speed, And animates to Fight the snorting Steed.— Cæsar scarce spoke, when sudden at the Word, They seize the Lance, and draw the shining Sword: At once the turfy Fences all lie waste, And thro' the Breach the crowding Legions haste: Regardless all of Order, and Array, They stand, and trust to Fate alone the Day. Strait, at the fatal Signal, all around A thousand Fifes, a thousand Clarions sound: Beyond where Clouds, or glancing Lightnings fly, The piercing Clangors strike the vaulted Sky. The joining Battles shout, and the loud Peal Bounds from the Hill, and thunders down the Vale.— Now flit the thrilling Darts thro' liquid Air, And various Vows from various Masters bear. Firm in the Front, with joining Bucklers clos'd, Stood the Pompeian Infantry dispos'd: So crowded was the Space, it scarce affords The Pow'r to toss their Piles, or weild their Swords. Forward, thus thick embattled tho' they stand, With headlong Wrath rush furious Cæsar's Band: In vain the lifted Shield their Rage retards, Or plaited Mail devoted Bosoms guards: Thro' Shields, thro' Mail, the wounding Weapons go, And to the Heart drive home each deadly Blow. From Pompey's ample Wings, at length, the Horse Wide o'er the Plain extending, take their Course: Wheeling, around the hostile Line they wind, While lightly arm'd the Slingers march behind. In various Ways the various Bands engage, And hurl upon the Foe the missile Rage: There fiery Darts, and rocky Fragments fly, And heating Bullets whistle thro' the Sky. Of feather'd Shafts, a Cloud thick shading goes, From Arab, Mede, and Ituræan Bows: But driv'n by random Aim they seldom wound: They hide the Heav'n at first, then strew the Ground: While Roman Hands unerring Mischief send, And certain Deaths on ev'ry Pile attend. But Cæsar, timely careful, to support His wav'ring Front against the first Effort, A Body of Reserve, in silence sent, To where the wheeling Foe their Fury bent. Then Pompey's Troops, nor mindful of the Fight, Nor stay'd by Shame, betake themselves to Flight. Some fiery Steeds, impatient of a Wound, Their Riders throw, and trample on the Ground: Strait the whole Corps with sudden Terror turn, And, in their flying, o'er their Friends are born. Hence foul Confusion, and Dismay succeed, The Victors murder, and the Vanquish'd bleed.— Prevailing still, the Victors held their Course, Till Pompey's main Reserve oppos'd their Force There in his Strength the Chief unshaken stood, Repell'd the Foe, and made the Combat good: There in suspense th' uncertain Battle hung, And Cæsar's fav'ring Goddess doubted long.— But Pompey soon, the Fate of Rome descry'd, And saw the changing Gods forsake his Side. Hard to believe, tho' from a rising Ground He view'd the universal Ruin round; In crimson Streams he saw Destruction run, And in the Fall of Thousands felt his own. Nor wish'd he, like most Wretches in Despair, The World one common Misery might share: But with a generous, great, exalted Mind, Besought the Gods to pity poor Mankind, To let him dye, and leave the rest behind. So saying, the tumultuous Field he cross'd, And warn'd from Battle his despairing Host. Then carry'd by his winged Steed away, He quits the purple Plain, and yields the Day.— Rowe. Luc. Lib. VII. Beauty. See Beautiful. Beauty, that fleeting Good, grows yearly less, And Time, alone, will spoil the finest Face. The Violet nor Lilly always blows, And Prickles oft survive the faded Rose. Grey Hairs, my Charmer, will disgrace thy Head, And thy fair Body Wrinkles overspread: Then by thy Virtues make thy Glory sure; The Mind's Perfections to the last endure.— Ovid. Art. Amand. Lib. II. Beauty, thou ensnaring Good, Scarce by Mortals understood! Fleeting Gift! which cannot stay, How swiftly doth Thou post away!— Sen. Hipp. Years, charming Maid! will spoil that lovely Face, And Wrinkles deep thy beauteous Front disgrace: Old Age advancing silently and slow, To all that's fair inexorable Foe! O'er all thy Charms his cruel Hand will lay, And each endearing Feature rend away.— Ovid. Trist. Lib. III. El. 7. Ah me! how soon a wrinkl'd Skin invades! How very soon a fine Complexion fades! Nor ought avails it even tho' you swear, That from your Infancy you'd some grey Hair; You grow all hoary in a few more Years, And then the venerable Truth appears.— Tate alter'd. Ovid. Art. Amand. Lib. III. Beauty's not lasting, nor is Fortune sure; But soon or late we all must Death endure.— Prop. II, 29. The Fair are haughty, Pride with Beauty dwells.— Ovid. I. Fast. Beauty with Virtue is a Sight that's rare: Chast is no Epithet to suit with Fair.— Dryden. Juven. Ah! Hellen, can you then so simple be, To think such Beauty can from Faults be free? Or change that Face, or you must needs be kind, Beauty and Virtue seldom have been joyn'd.— Duke. Ovid. Ep. XV. Trust not to Beauty only, O ye Fair! That's not enough, make better Things your Care: Smart Wit, fine Sense, the Tongue's endearing Grace, Far, far excel the finest-featur'd Face. In vain are all the other Aids of Art, Good-Nature only can secure the Heart.— Petron. Arb. Beauty, it's Power. To him, disdaining or to feign a Tear, Or spread her artfully dishevel'd Hair, In comely Sorrow's decent Garb array'd, And trusting to her Beauty's certain Aid, In Words like these began the Cleopatra. Pharian Maid.— In vain her Words the Warrior's Ears assail'd, Had not her Face beyond her Tongue prevail'd: From thence resistless Eloquence she draws, And with the sweet Perswasion gains her Cause.

Mean time the Atalanta running, and admir'd by Hippomenes. Virgin flies, or seems to fly, Swift as a Scythian Arrow cleaves the Sky: Still more and more, the Youth her Charms admires: The Race itself t' exalt her Charms conspires. The golden Pinions, which her Feet adorn, In wanton Flutt'rings by the Winds are born. Down from her Head, the long, fair Tresses flow, And sport with lovely Negligence below. The waving Ribbons, which her Buskins tye, Her snowy Skin with waving Purple dye: As crimson Veils, in Palaces display'd, To the white Marble lend a blushing Shade.— Eusden. Ovid. Met. Lib. X. Æneas, now, adorn'd with ev'ry Grace, Shone forth, in Shape and Features like a God: For Venus with the rosy Bloom of Youth Had flush'd her Son, with comely Locks adorn'd, And breath'd a sparkling Lustre on his Eyes. Such is the Beauty which the Artists Hand To polish'd Iv'ry lends: So Silver shines, Or Parian Stone, enchas'd in yellow Gold.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. I. But far above the Rest in Beauty shines The great Æneas, when the Troop he joins: Like fair Apollo, when he leaves the Frost Of wintry Xanthus, and the Lycian Coast: When to his native Delos he resorts, Ordains the Dances, and renews the Sports: Green Wreaths of Bays his Length of Hair inclose: A Golden Fillet binds his aweful Brows: His Quiver sounds: Not less the Prince is seen In Beauty, graceful, and commanding Mein.— Dryden. Virg. Æn. Lib. IV. Young Pallas shone conspicuous o'er the rest: Gilded his Arms, embroider'd was his Vest. So, from the Seas, exerts his radiant Head, The Star, by whom the Lights of Heav'n are led: Shakes from his rosy Locks the pearly Dews: Dispels the Darkness, and the Day renews.— Dryden. Æn. Lib.

Graceful was Athis. his Mein, His Person lovely, and his Age sixteen. His Habit made his native Beauty more: A purple Mantle fring'd with Gold he wore. Rich Chains of Gold adorn'd his Neck so fair, And moist with Myrrh was form'd a Crownet of his Hair.— Mainwaring alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. V. Thy beauteous Eyes shine with celestial Fire, And rosy Odours from thy Neck aspire: Brighter than Gold thy burnish'd Tresses flow, Thy balmy Lips like the bright Crimson glow. Meandring Veins sublime thy Bosom's White, And ev'ry Grace adorns Thee for Delight. Each Goddess' boasted Charms in thine we see, And vanquish'd Venus yields the Prize to Thee. Thy Hands are silver, and with am'rous Pride The silky Threads thro' thy soft Fingers slide. Thy Feet, too lovely e'er to touch the Ground! From no invidious Pebbles fear a Wound: For whensoe'er you o'er the Lillies tread, Th' uninjur'd Flow'r scarce bends its snowy Head. Let costly Jewels meaner Beauties wear, To grace their Necks, or glitter in their Hair: You, unadorn'd, are exquisitely fair. There's some Defect in ev'ry Thing we view, But Envy's self can't spy a Fault in you.— Addison jun. Petron. Arb. frag. Bees. See Labour. Of all the mute Creation, These alone A public Weal, and common Int'rest know, Imbody'd: and subsist by certain Laws. Mindful of Winter, they in Summer toil: And for their Country's Good preserve their Store. Some, by joint Compact, range the Fields for Food, Industrious: Others in their Tents at home, Narcissus' clammy Tears, and Gum from Trees, Lay, as the first Foundation of their Combs: Then into Arches build the viscid Wax. Others draw forth their Colonies adult, The Nation's Hope: Some work the purer Sweets And with the liquid Nectar stretch their Cells: Some (such their Post allotted) at the Gates, Stand Sentry: and alternate watch, the Rain, And Clouds, observing: or unlade their Friends Returning: or in Troops beat off the Drones, A lazy Cattle: Hot the Work proceeds: And fresh with Thyme the fragrant Honey smells.— Trap. Virg. Georg. IV. The inbred Love of getting prompts the Bees Their Labour to divide. The aged Sires With curious Architecture build their Cells: And guard their Towns, and fortify their Combs. But late at Night the Youth fatigu'd return, Their Legs with Thyme full-laden: hov'ring round They suck the Arbutus, and Willows grey, Sweet Lavendar, and Crocus' yellow Flow'r, The purple Hyacinth, and gummy Lime. They toil together, and together rest: With the first Morn they issue from their Gates: Again, when Vesper warns them to return From feeding, and the Fields: they homewards bend, Refresh their Bodies, and with murm'ring Noise Hum round the Sides, and Entrance of their Hives: At length in Silence hush'd all Night repose, And with soft Sleep relieve their weary Limbs. While Rain impends, or Winds begin to rise, They rove not far from Home, nor trust the Sky: But drink, secure, beneath their City's Walls, And short Excursions try: and oft with Sand Ballast Themselves, like Ships on tossing Waves, And poise their Bodies thro' the Void of Air.— Trap. Ibid. —Not Egypt, nor wide Lydia's Realms, Nor Parthia, nor Hydaspes with such Zeal Adore their King.—Their King surviving, All Unanimous concur: his Death dissolves Society: Themselves their Honey-Stores, And all the curious Texture of their Combs Demolish. He o'er all their Works presides: Him they admire: and in one Body form'd, Humming, inclose Him round: and oft in War Support Him on their Shoulders: for his Life Expose their own, and court a glorious Death,— Trap. Ibid. If to the Fight they issue forth, (for oft Between two Kings, with Tumult, Discord reigns:) The Vulgar's Rage, and Courage, and their Hearts Trembling with eager Appetite of War, You may foreknow. A Clarion, shrill as Brass, Rouses the Laggers; and a martial Noise Distant is heard, like Trumpets broken Sounds. Then trembling they unite, and shake their Wings, And with their sharp Proboscis whet their Darts, And fit their Claws: and round their Monarch's Court Thicken, and muster: and with loud Acclaim Provoke the Foe.—Now, having gain'd a Sky Serene, and open Fields of vernal Air, They issue from their Gates, and join the Shock Of Battle: Humming thro' th' Etherial Void, In one huge Cluster they conglobe, and fall Precipitant: Nor thicker falls the Hail, Nor Show'rs of Acorns from a shaken Oak. The Kings themselves, betwixt the middle Ranks, Conspicuous shine, and spread their glist'ning Wings: (Their little Bodies mighty Souls inform.) The One (for diff'rent are their Species) burns With vary'd Spots, and Gold: his Form all o'er Beauteous, and bright with glist'ring Scales: this Kind The Best: the Other horrid, and with Sloth Inglorious, trails his swagging Paunch along. Nor less the People, than their Kings, are found Of Forms distinct: Some foul, of dusky Hue; As when the Trav'ler, on a sandy Road, From his dry Mouth spits Froth commix'd with Dust: Some glaring Shine, and glow with Drops of Gold.— Trap. Ibid. One Quality in Bees thou wilt admire: That genial Love they know not, nor indulge Venus' This mistaken Notion, which prevail'd in Virgil's Days, is now exploded. soft Joys, nor propagate their Kind. From Herbs, and fragrant Simples, with their Mouths They cull their Young: from thence the Insect King, And all his little Subjects they supply. And therefore tho' their Term of Life be short, (Nor beyond seven Summers e'er extends) Yet the immortal Progeny remains: For many Years the Kingdom's Fortune stands, And Grandsires number Grandsires in their Line.— Trap. Ibid. Beggar. Thirsty, at last, by long Fatigue, Ceres in search of her Daughter Proserpine. she grows, But meets no Spring; no Riv'let near her flows. Then looking round, by Accident she spies, A Cottage thatch'd with Straw, and thither hies. The Goddess knocking at the little Door, 'Twas open'd by a Woman old and poor, Who, when she begg'd for Water, gave her Ale, Brew'd long, but well preserv'd from being stale. The Goddess drank: a chuffy Lad was by, Who saw the Liquor with a grutching Eye And grinning cries,—She's greedy more than dry.— Maynwaring alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. V. Water do You deny? Indeed, 'tis hard From Nature's common Rights to be debar'd: This, as the genial Sun, and vital Air, Should flow alike to ev'ry Creature's Share. Yet, still I ask, and as a Favour crave, That, which a publick Bounty, Nature gave. Now from my Throat the usual Moisture dries, And ev'n my Voice in broken Accents dies: One Draught, as dear as Life, I should esteem, And Water, now I thirst, would Nectar seem.— Croxall. Ovid. Met.

Of Alban Wine, a Cask in Store I'ave got, that's nine Years old and more: And Parsley in my Garden grows, And Ivy to adorn thy Brows: Ivy, my Dear, shall finely shine, And fair among thy Curls entwine. My House with Silver glitters round: My Altar, with chast Vervain bound, Now only wants the Lamb whose Blood Must sprinkle o'er the sacred Wood. All Hands at work, with busy Care My Boys and Maids the Feast prepare: In curling Volumes, through the Sky Thick Smoke does from my Chimney fly. But would You know what Joys to Night I call You to, and why invite: You're now to celebrate the Ide Which does fair April's Month divide: April, to Sea-born Venus dear, Whose welcome Ide shall ev'ry Year, Be kept in solemn Wise by me, More than my own Nativity: For my Mœcenas from this Sun His date of rolling Years begun.— Hor. Lib. IV. Ode 11. Blushing. The Hermaphroditus. Boy knew Nought of Love, but touch'd with Shame, Look'd down, and blush'd: his Blushes well became: So Apples glow upon the sunny Side; So Iv'ry looks with rich Vermilion dy'd; So shews the Moon, when all her silver White Turns in Eclipses to a ruddy Light, And Brass resounds in vain.— Addison alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. IV. —She Arachne. blush'd;—against her Will the rising Red Flush'd in her Cheeks, and thence as swiftly fled.

A Crimson Blush Lavinia. her beauteous Face o'er-spread, Varying her Cheeks by turns with white and red. The driving Colours, never at a Stay, Run here, and there, and flush, and fade away. Delightful Change! thus Indian Iv'ry shows Which with the bord'ring Paint of Purple glows: Or Lillies damask'd by the neighb'ring Rose.— Dryden. Virg. Æn. Lib.

Fair He appear'd, like shining Cynthia bright, And purple Blushes grac'd the snowy White: Such glowing Blushes stain the modest Maid, When to th' expecting am'rous Youth convey'd, And the new Pleasures of the Bridal Bed.

Lib. III. El. 4. A Crimson Blush her conscious Face o'erspread— So rising Phœbus paints the Skies with red: So looks the Virgin in her nuptial Bed: So op'ning Roses mix'd with Lillies glow: So does the Moon in her Eclipses show.— Ovid. Amor. Lib. II. El. 5. Boasting. See Pride. For tho' some talk they less should fear to die, Than live with a Disease, or Infamy: That they know well the Soul consists in Blood, And our Philosophy can do no good: Observe, they talk thus, rather out of Love To empty Praise, than, what they say, approve. For these same Men, to Chains, or Banishment, Condemn'd; to Gallies, or to Prisons sent: Tho' infamous by horrid Crimes they're grown, Yet still endure, and patiently live on. Nay more, where-e'er these boasting Wretches come, They sacrifice black Sheep on ev'ry Tomb, To please the Manes: and of all the Rout, When Cares and Dangers press, grow most devout.— Creech. Lucret. Lib. III. But I am nobly born:—'tis true: go boast Thy Pedigree, the Thing thou valu'st most: Besides I am a Beau:—that too I grant:— She that cry's Herbs has less Impertinence, And, in her Calling, more of common Sense.— Dryden. Pers. Sat. IV. My Work is finish'd, which nor dreads the Rage Of Tempests, Fire, or War, or wasting Age: Come, soon or late, Death's undetermin'd Day, This mortal Being only can decay: My nobler Part, my Fame, shall reach the Skies, And to late Times with blooming Honours rise: Whate'er th' unbounded Roman Pow'r obeys, All Climes and Nations shall recal my Praise: If 'tis allow'd to Poets to divine One half of round Eternity is mine.— Welsted. Ovid. Met. Lib. XV. A Monument, more durable than Brass, And whose Magnificence does far surpass Egypt's proud Pyramids, I've rais'd:—In vain The northern Blast, the southern Show'rs of Rain, Ages, and Time shall strive to pull it down again. All of me shall not die: my Works shall save The Noblest Portion from the greedy Grave: I still shall flourish in the Rolls of Fame, Still shall Posterity revere my Name; Till the High-Priest and silent Maid no more Ascend the Capitol, and Jove adore.— Hor. Lib. III. Ode 30. Boy Handsome. The lovely Boy was born with ev'ry Grace; Ev'n Envy must have prais'd so fair a Face: Such was his Form, as Painters when they show Their utmost Art, on naked Loves bestow. But lest the Dress should any Diff'rence make, Shafts give to him, or else from Cupid take.— Dryd. alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. X. Full in the midst, the princely Youth of Troy By Venus lov'd, and worthy all her Care, (His beauteous Head uncover'd) shone to View: As shines a Gem inclos'd in yellow Gold, Grace to the Head, or Neck: or Iv'ry set, With curious Art, in Ebony, or Box: His snowy Neck receives his flowing Hair, Clasp'd in a Circle of soft ductile Gold.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. X. Boxing. —Forthwith uprises stern, Dares: and with the Murmur of the Croud, Rears his rough Visage, and prodigious Strength: Shews his broad Shoulders, his Alternate Arms Protends, and in mock Duel beats the Air. For him a Match is sought: nor dares ev'n One From all that vast Assembly to approach The Challenger, or arm his Hands for Fight. Acestes then Entellus thus upbraids: Entellus, bravest Hero once in vain, Where is our Eryx, vainly boasted God, Your Master? Where your Fame thro' all this Isle Renown'd? And Trophies hanging round your Roof? To whom Entellus; 'Tis not that the Love Of Praise and Glory has my Breast thro' Fear Abandon'd; But my Blood by freezing Age Is cold, retarded: And my Strength benumb'd Within my sapless Trunk.—This said, He flings Into the Midst two Gauntlets huge, of Weight Enormous: Those which warlike Eryx wore In Fight, and whose stiff Leather brac'd his Arms. Amaz'd were All: so vast the sev'n tough Hides Of Bulls, with Lead and Iron sewn between: But more than all the rest, the Champion's Self, Dares, aghast, and at a Distance stands, Refusing.—Him thus the aged Sire bespeaks: If Trojan Dares thinks these Arms unequal, Let Us have due Proportion in the Strife. —Thus he spoke: And from his Shoulders flings his double Vest, Strips his huge Limbs, huge Bones, and brawny Arms: And in the Midst with mighty Stature stands.— Then Prince Æneas equal Gauntlets brings, And binds the Wrists of both with equal Weight. Forthwith, erect, and high upon their Toes, Both stand, and fearless raise their Arms in Air: Lean back their lofty Heads, to shun the Stroke, Mix Hands with Hands, and irritate the Fight. The One excelling in his nimble Feet, And confident in Youth: The Other strong In Limbs, and Bulk: but slow with trembling Knees He staggers, and the panting Labour shakes His huge-built Trunk. In vain repeated Wounds They aim alternate: On their hollow Flanks The Strokes redoubled ring: Their throbbing Breasts Are batter'd with loud Noise: The bandy'd Blows Err round their Ears and Temples: And beneath The rigid Lead their cracking Jaws resound. Firm by his Weight, in one fix'd Posture stands Entellus: With his Body and quick Eyes Alone, eluding his Assailant's Strokes. He, like a Warrior, who some lofty Town Assaults by Storm; or under Arms besets A Castle on a Hill, now These, now Those Approaches tries, the Place all round with Art Exploring: and with various Efforts vain Urges his Foe.—Entellus shews his Arm Rais'd high: The Other swift foresees the Blow Descending from his Head, and nimbly slips Aside: Entellus on the empty Air Loses his Strength, and heavy to the Ground Falls with vast Weight.— Heav'n rings with Shouts. But, not at all dismay'd, Nor by his Fall retarded, to the Fight The Hero with redoubled Force returns: Rouses his Strength with Rage: Shame fires his Soul, And conscious Worth: O'er all the Field he drives Dares precipitate: now with the Right, Now with the Left, reit'rating his Blows: Nor Pause, nor Respite. Thick as Hail in Storms Rattles on Roofs, with such repeated Strokes, This Way, and That, the Hero with both Hands Buffets his Foe: and turns, and whirls him round. Then Prince Æneas could no longer bear Such Fury to proceed, but ends the Fight, And rescues fainting Dares— —Him, with tott'ring Pace Trailing his Legs along, on either Side Swagging his Head, and belching from his Throat Thick Clots of Gore, and Teeth commix'd with Blood, His Mates, officious to their vanquish'd Friend, Lead— Trap.

Bulls Fighting. —With mighty Force Two Bulls in Battle join: repeated Wounds Mutual inflict: Black Gore their Bodies laves: Their Horns against each other struggling push Direct: They roar aloud: The Woods, and huge Olympus' Top reverberate the Noise. Nor after this can both together feed: The Vanquish'd quits the Field, and exil'd seeks Some unknown distant Coast, his dire Disgrace Much mourning, and the haughty Victor's Wounds, And his lost Loves, which unreveng'd he leaves: And looking back, with oft retorted Eye, From his hereditary Realm retires.— Trap. Georg. Lib. III. As when two mighty Bulls, with hostile Force, And pushing Horns, in dreadful Battle join, The trembling Keepers, and the Herd aloof Stand mute with Fear: the Heifers faintly lowe, Doubtful to which the Empire of the Wood Must fall, which Lord the Pastures must obey. They with prodigious Strength alternate Wounds Inflict: with clatt'ring Horns each other gore, And with large Blood their Necks and Dewlaps lave: The Wood all round rebellows to the Noise.— Id. Æn. Lib. XII. Captive. The faithless Garrison betray the Town, And Captive drag their valiant Leader down. The noble Roman, fearless, tho' in Bands, Before his haughty Fellow-Subject stands, With Looks erect, and with a daring Brow, Death he provokes, and courts the fatal Blow.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. II. At length in Presence of the Victor plac'd, A fitting Dignity his Gesture grac'd, That spoke his present Fortunes and his past. With decent Mixture in his manly Mein, The Captive and the General were seen.— Id. Lucan. Lib. IV. Behold Cassandra, lo! the Royal Fair, From Pallas' Shrine, with loose dishevel'd Hair, Drag'd by the shouting Victors:—To the Skies She rais'd, but rais'd in vain! her glowing Eyes: Her Eyes,—she could no more—the Grecian Bands Had rudely manacled her tender Hands.— Pitt. Æn. Lib. II Care. The Fears and Cares which torture human Hearts, Despite the Clash of Arms, and points of Darts; With mighty Kings and Potentates make bold, Maugre their Purple, and their shining Gold.— Lucr. Lib. II. Let no Concern, no Cares for Life approach; For Life, which lasts not long, and asks not much. Youth soon is gone, and Beauty quickly fades, And sapless Age besilvers o'er our Heads: Swift, swift away, the smiling Minutes move, And leave no room for Rest, or wanton Love. Nor Flow'rs with vernal Glory alway blow, Nor her bright Face does Phœbe always show: And why don't you to harrass out forbear A Mind unequal to continual Care? Why underneath some tow'ring Poplar's Shade, Or spreading Pine, ar'n't we supinely laid: Our silver Hairs with fragrant Roses crown'd, Assyrian Nard perfuming all around? Why rashly, whilst we can, do we delay To drink our Troubles and our Cares away?— Hor. Lib. II. Ode 2. Why should our Time run out in useless Years, Of anxious Troubles, and tormenting Fears? With no Success, and no Advantage crown'd, Why should we still tread an unfinish'd Round? Why should deluding Hopes disturb our Ease, Vain to pursue, yet eager to possess? Grown grey in Cares, how senseless is the Strife! In seeking how to live we waste a Life. The more we have, the meaner is our Store, Whilst what we have we lose, and only crave for more.— Creech alter'd. Man. Lib. IV. Ceres. First Ceres taught, the Ground with Grain to sow, And arm'd with Iron Shares the crooked Plough, When now Dodonian Oaks no more supply'd Their Mast, and other Trees their Forests Fruits deny'd.— Dryd. Virg. Georg. Lib. I. Thy annual Off'rings to great Ceres bring, On the green Turf performing sacred Rites, When Winter ends, and Spring now smiles serene. Ceres let all thy rustic Youth adore: For her do Thou with Honey mingle Milk, And gentle Wine: And round the recent Grain Let the propitious Victim thrice be led: Her in full Chorus let the Peasants all Singing attend, and with loud Shouts invite Ceres beneath their Rooss: Nor any thrust His Sickle to the Corn: till wreath'd with Oak, To Ceres he has paid the Honours due, With uncouth Dances, and unpolish'd Verse.— Trap. Ibid. The solemn Feast of Ceres now was near, When long white Linnen Stoles the Matrons wear: Rank'd in Procession walk the pious Train, Off'ring First-fruits, and Wreaths of golden Grain: For nine long Nights the Nuptial Bed they shun, And sanctifying Harvest, lie alone.— Dryden. Ovid. Met. Lib. X. Ceres her Dragons guides; aloft they fly, And print a winding Track along the Sky: The curbing Bit with rising Foam they stain, And work their harmless Poison on the Rein. High rise their Crests, and beauteous to behold, Their speckled Backs are scal'd with green and gold. Now thro' the Zephyrs they direct their Flight, And now descending, on the Meadows light: The whirling Wheels revolving o'er the Ground, The Fields impregnate, as the Glebe they wound: A sudden Harvest starts upon the Plain, And in the Furrows springs the yellow Grain, Where e'er she comes.— Hughes alter'd. Claud. Rapt. Pros. I. Ceres the Pow'r of the prolific Year, A Daughter had superlatively fair, Nor bore a second Birth: in This alone More Honours she obtain'd, and more Renown, Than all the teeming Mothers: in her Face Her Proserpine had summ'd the Beauties of a Race.— Hughes. alter'd. Ibid. Chance. See God. Providence. If Chance these Things bestow'd, and rules the Whole, Why do the Signs in constant Order roll? Observe set Times to shut and ope' the Day, Find the same Track, nor once mistake their Way? Why thro' their Course, as if by Laws confin'd, Haste none away, and leave the rest behind? Why in the Summer do we always spy, The self-same Stars by Night, adorn the Sky? Why do, each Winter, constantly, again Others return to gild the azure Plain? Why ev'ry Day does Phœbus' cheering Flame, Shew the same World, and leave it still the same?— Creech alter'd. Manil. Lib. I. And that the Sun ne'er drives the rising Day From North to South, nor leaves the beaten Way: That still at Night he hastens down the West, Nor ever turns his Horses towards the East: That Light, by just Degrees, the Moon adorns, First shews, then bends, then fills her borrow'd Horns: And that the Stars in constant Order roll, Nor fall, nor change their Distance from the Pole, Is not the Work of Chance; but speaks aloud The wise and steady Conduct of a God.— Id. Ibid. Change. Earth rarifies to Dew: expanded more, The subtile Dew in Air begins to soar: Spreads as She flies, and weary of her Name, Extenuates still, and changes into Flame. Thus having, by Degrees, Perfection won, Restless, they soon untwist the Web they spun: And Fire begins to lose her radiant Hue, Mixt with gross Air; and Air descends to Dew: And Dew condensing does her Form foregoe, And sink a heavy Lump of Earth below.— Dryden. Ovid. Met. Lib. XV. Thus ev'n our Bodies daily Change receive: Some Part of what was Their's before, they leave: Nor are to Day what Yesterday they were: Nor the whole Same to Morrow will appear.— Dryden. Ibid. Thus are their Figures never at a stand; But chang'd by Nature's innovating Hand; All Things are alter'd, nothing is destroy'd: For some new Show the shifted Scene's employ'd. Then to be born, is to begin to be Some other Thing we were not formerly: And what we call to Die, is not t'appear, Or be the Thing, which formerly we were. Those very Elements, that we partake Alive, when Dead, some other Bodies make: Translated, shift their Form, and change their Course: But Death on deathless Substance has no Force.— Id. Ibid. The Face of Places, and their Forms, decay: And that is solid Earth, that once was Sea: Seas, in their Turn, retreating from the Shore, Make solid Land, what Ocean was before: And far from Strands are Shells of Fishes found, And rusty Anchors fix'd on Mountain-Ground: And what were Fields before, now wash'd and worn By falling Floods from high, to Vallies turn, And crumbling still descend to level Lands: And Lakes, and trembling Bogs, are barren Sands: And the parch'd Desart floats in Streams unknown, Wondring to drink of Waters not her own. Here Nature living Fountains opes; and there Seals up the Wombs where living Fountains were. Or Earthquakes stop their ancient Course, and bring Diverted Streams to feed a distant Spring.— Id. Ibid. —Whatever lies In Earth, or flits in Air, or fills the Skies, All suffer Change.— Ev'n mighty Empires flourish, and decay; By Turns command, and in their Turns obey.— Dryden. Ibid. —Thro' the mighty Frame There's nothing that continues still the same: As Years wheel round, a Change must needs ensue, Things lose their former State, and take a new; Now tir'd with Births, the Fields refuse to bear, Now, unmanur'd, prevent the Tiller's Care. Vapours dilated tare the solid Earth: Strong the Convulsions at the fatal Birth: Vast Mountains sink: And now his large Command Neptune extends, and Seas o'erspread the Land, Contemning Shores: Thus Cities were o'erflow'd, When, Mankind's single Heir, Deucalion stood On steep Parnassus, to repair the Stock: The spacious World possessing in one Rock. And when bold Phaëton, with unequal Force, The Chariot fill'd, and drove the flaming Horse: The Earth took Fire, Heav'n saw the Stars recoil, And frighted Nature fear'd one common Pile. So much, as Years roll round, the mighty Frame Is chang'd, yet still returns to be the same.— Creech. Manil. Lib. IV. Chaos. Before the Seas, and this terrestrial Ball, And Heav'n's high Canopy that covers all, Nature one Face of Things, a Chaos show'd; An indigested, heavy, formless Load: Where ill-cemented Seeds in Discord jarr'd, And all the Elements together warr'd. No Sun was lighted up, the World to view, No Moon did yet her blunted Horns renew: Nor Earth, self-balanc'd, in the Air was plac'd, Nor yet kind Ocean's Arms the Ball embrac'd. Then Sea, and Air, and Earth confounded were, Unstable was the Earth, and dark the Air, The Sea unnavigable.— No certain Form on any was imprest, All were confus'd, and each disturb'd the Rest: The Cold and Hot, the Dry and Humid fight, The Soft, and Hard, the Heavy and the Light. But God and careful Nature interpose, To reconcile the elemental Foes: He Earth from Heav'n, and Sea from Earth disjoyns, And from gross Air the purer Heav'n refines. Then by his prudent Care, the Mass controul'd, Began its blind Materials to unfold: He to each Portion proper Seats assigns, And all the beauteous Whole in Peace combines.— Dryd. alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. I. Charioteer. As when the Racers from their Barriers start, And whirl around the Goal: the Charioteer Vainly attempts to check the flying Steeds: Himself is born away: the dusty Car Swift smokes along: nor, bounding, hears the Rein.— Trap. Virg. Georg. Lib. I. With Force less rapid, starting from their Bounds, The Chariots whirl, and smoke along the Field: Less earnestly the eager Charioteers O'er their swift Horses shake the waving Reins, Hang prone upon the Lash, and bending fly.— Id. Æn. Lib. V. Thrown from a Chariot. The frighted Horses pricking up their Ears A while stood trembling:—sudden then they flew, And o'er the Rocks the rattling Chariot drew. In vain to stop the hot-mouth'd Steeds Hippolitus. I try'd, And bending backward all my Strength apply'd: The frothy Foam in driving Flakes distains The Bits, and Bridles, and bedews the Reins. But though as yet untam'd they ran, at length Their heady Rage had tir'd beneath my Strength, When, in the Spoke a Stump entangling, tore The shatter'd Wheel, and from its Axle bore. The Shock impetuous toss'd me from the Seat; Caught in the Reins beneath my Horses' Feet, My reeking Guts dragg'd out alive, around The jagged Stump my trembling Nerves were wound. Then stretch'd the well-knit Limbs, the Pieces hal'd, Part stuck behind, and Part the Chariot trail'd: Till midst my cracking Joints, and breaking Bones, I breath away my weary'd Soul in Groans. No Parts, distinguish'd from the rest, were found, But all my Parts an universal Wound.— Catcot alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. XV. Charm. See Circe. Enchantress. Magic Power. Bring hither Water, bind the Altars round With a soft Fillet: fertile Vervain burn, And strongest Frankincense: that I may try With sacred Magic Rites to turn the Brain Of him I love:—Nought, here but Charms we want. First these three Lists distinct with Colours three Round Thee I bind: thrice round the Altars lead Thy Image: Heav'n uneven Numbers loves. Bring Daphnis, bring him from the Town, my Charms! Three Colours, Amaryllis, in three Knots Industrious knit: quick, Amaryllis, quick: Knit them; and say,—'Tis Venus' Knot I tye.— As this Clay hardens, and this Wax grows soft By the same Fire: so Daphnis by my Love. Crumble this Cake, and with Bitumen burn The crackling Bays:—me cruel Daphnis burns: And I for cruel Daphnis burn these Bays. May Love, like that with which the Heifer raves, When thro' the Thickets, and high Woods, fatigu'd She seeks the Bull, then near a River's Stream Restless lies down, amidst the verdant Sedge, Nor minds at latest Ev'ning to return: May such Love Daphnis seize, nor I incline To ease his Frenzy, or abate his Pain. These Relicks, these dear Pledges of himself, With me, long since, the faithless Shepherd left: These now, ev'n in the Entrance, I commit, O Earth, to Thee: Daphnis these Pledges owe. These Ashes, Amaryllis, forth convey: Throw them into the River, o'er thy Head, And look not back: Daphnis with these I'll try: He nought the Gods, nor ought our Charms regards. Behold, the Ashes, while I thus delay To bear them hence, now lick the Altar round With trembling Flames, spontaneous:—May it prove Auspicious!—Something sure, I know not what, There is: and Hylax in the Entrance bays. May I believe it? Or do Those who love Dream of the Bliss which fondly they desire?— Trap. Virg. Ecl. VIII. No more:—my Daphnis comes! no more, my Charms: He comes, from Town, to my desiring Arms.— Chastity. In Saturn's Reign, at Nature's early Birth, There was that Thing call'd Chastity on Earth: When in a narrow Cave, their common Shade, The Sheep, the Shepherds, and their Gods were laid: When Reeds, and Leaves, and Hides of Beasts were spread By Mountain-Housewives, for their homely Bed, And mossy Pillows rais'd, for the rude Husband's Head. Unlike the Niceness of our modern Dames, (Affected Nymphs, with new affected Names:) The Cynthias, and the Lesbias of our Years, Who for a Sparrow's Death dissolve in Tears. Those first unpolish'd Matrons, big and bold, Gave suck to Infants of gigantick Mould: Rough as their savage Lords who rang'd the Wood, And fat with Acorns, belch'd their windy Food.— Some thin Remains of Chastity appear'd Ev'n under Jove, but Jove without a Beard: Before the servile Greeks had learn'd to swear By Heads of Kings: while yet the bounteous Year Her common Fruits in open Fields expos'd, E'er Thieves were fear'd, or Gardens were inclos'd. At length affronted Justice upwards flew, And Chastity with her:— From Earth to Heav'n the Sisters both withdrew. From that old Æra whoring did begin, So venerably ancient is the Sin: Adult'rers then invade the nuptial State, And Marriage Beds creak'd with a foreign Weight. All other Ills did Iron Times adorn, But Whores and Silver in one Age were born.— Dryden. Juv. Sat. VI. I hear your cautious Counsel, you would say, Keep close your Women under Lock and Key: But who shall keep those Keepers? Women, nurst In Craft, begin with those, and bribe them first. The Sex is turn'd all Whore: they love the Game: And Mistresses, and Maids, are both the same.— Id. Ibid. No ill Man's happy: least of all is He Whose Study 'tis to ruin Chastity.— Juv. Sat. IV. No Art can Chastity when lost restore, Once forfeited 'tis ne'er recover'd more.— Ovid. Strait with the hidden Steel Lucretia. she pierc'd her Side, And at her Father's Feet fell down and dy'd: Yet, as she fell, her dying Thoughts contriv'd, To fall as modestly as she had liv'd.— Anon. Ovid. Fast. II. She's truly chast, and worthy of that Name, Who hates the Ill, as well as fears the Shame: And that vile Woman whom Restraint keeps in, Tho' she forbear the Act, has done the Sin, Spies, Locks, and Bolts, may keep her brutal Part: But Thou'rt an odious Cuckold in her Heart.— Sedley. Ov. Am. L. III. El. 4. Unmanner'd I may be, but not unchast; Nor is my Fame with any Stain defac'd: Tho' in my Face there's no affected Frown, Nor a feign'd Niceness in my Carriage shown, My Honour I preserve without a Stain, Nor has my Love made any Coxcomb vain.— Ovid. Epist. Circe. See. Enchantress. Magic Power. —Now close by Circe's Shores they sail; Where she, the wealthy Daughter of the Sun, With ceaseless Singing makes the Groves resound; Groves inaccessible: and in the Rooms Of her proud Palace, for nocturnal Light, Sweet Cedar burns: While thro' the slender Web Her whistling Shuttle flies along the Loom. Hence Groans are heard: the Noise of Lions, fierce, Rebellious to their Chains, and roaring loud In Dead of Night: the Grunt of bristly Boars: The Rage of Bears reluctant in their Stalls: And huge portentous Forms of howling Wolves. All which, with pow'rful Charms, from human Shapes The cruel Goddess Circe had transform'd To savage Beasts.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. VII. Arriv'd, when near the Palace Gates we came, A thousand Wolves, and Bears, and Lions rise, And chill our Hearts with Horror and Surprize: Yet soon we found there was no Cause to fear, For none seem savage, or to wound prepare: But courteous wag their Tails, and fawning greet; And tame, and gentle, follow at our Feet: Till a bright Train of She-attendants come, And lead us up the lofty marble Dome; To where retired, and in solemn State, High, on her sumptuous Throne, their Mistress sat: Her costly Robes with royal Splendor shone, And over all a Veil of Gold was thrown. Her Maids, the Nymphs, and Nereids, ne'er were bred To card the Wool, or draw the flowing Thread: But they in Baskets sort the mingled Flow'rs, And Herbs of various Hues, and various Powers. While She, their Mistress, who the Virtues knew Of ev'ry Simple, and what each can do, Alone, or mixt: the Herbs with Care inspects, And the due Quantity or Weight directs. Now to her Presence brought, she from her Throne Our Compliments does courteously return: And grants whate'er we ask, with such a Look, As kindly Welcome, and fair Friendship spoke. Then she commands, with Speed, her ready Train, To bring the Honey, Curds, and Barley-Grain: In gen'rous Wine th' Ingredients they infuse: She to the Potion adds some secret Juice: With her own execrable Hand she crown'd, And dealt the unsuspected Goblet round. Whilst gladly we, with Heat and Travel dry, To our parch'd Lips the magic Draught apply, Her potent Charms th' Enchantress strait prepares, And o'er us waves her Wand, and strokes our Hairs. (I blush to tell, and yet it must be told) Soon rough'ning Bristles all my Form infold. I strove to speak, and fain would have complain'd, But Grunts were all the Language now remain'd: Prone to the Earth my alter'd Aspect bends, And a strange Snout my widen'd Jaws extends: New Sinews swell my strong and harden'd Chest, The bestial Nature was o'er all impress'd: Those Hands which lately did the Bowl surround, The Work of Feet perform, and tread the Ground. Then with the rest whom Fate had thus unman'd, (So great a Potency has magic Draughts) I in a Stye was shut.— Eurylochus, alone, his Form retain'd: He, only from the offer'd Cup refrain'd: Which had he not rejected, with the rest Himself had been transform'd, their Fellow-Beast. Nor should Ulysses our Mishaps have known, Or forc'd th' Enchantress to return his own. Peace bearing Hermes gave him a white Flower, Call'd Moly by the Gods, of wondrous Pow'r. Safe in this Gift, and the conducting Gods, The Hero enters Circe's dire Abodes: Again she does th' enchanted Bowl demand, Again prepares to wave her magic Wand: But he her Charms prevents his Sabre draws, And, brandishing aloft, th' Enchantress awes. Struck with Amaze, her Hand and Faith she plights, And to her Bed the Victor-Chief invites: E'er he'll submit, the Terms of Peace he names, And his chang'd Friends restor'd, in Dowry, claims. Soon healing Herbs are brought; and o'er our Heads Their safe and inoffensive Juice she sheds: The Incantation backward she repeats, Inverts her Rod, and what she did, defeats. And now our Skin grows smooth, our Shape upright, Our Arms stretch up, our cloven Feet unite: Our Neck and Shoulders take their former Grace, And, weeping, We our weeping Prince embrace: Each hangs about his Neck: nor scarce a Word Breaks thro' our Lips, but such as Thanks afford.— Theobald alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. XIV. 'Twice turn'd she to the East, twice to the West, Thrice touch'd Picus King of Italy turn'd into a Woodpecker by Circe. him with her Wand, three Charms express'd. He flies, and wondring why so fast he fled, Beholds his Limbs with shining Plumes o'erspread. Forthwith he seeks the Woods, and angry still, Hard Oaks assails, and wounds them with his Bill. His Wings the Purple of his Robe assume, The Gold that clasp'd his Garment turns to Plume. Around his Neck, a glitt'ring Circle glows: And so compleat his Change,— The Name alone he e'er was Picus shews. Ibid. And now th' Enchantress noxious Juices sheds, And sprinkles baleful Venom o'er their Heads. From Erebus, and Chaos' dire Abodes, Conjures old Night, and all th' Infernal Gods: While she with Howlings Hecate's Aid intreats, Woods (wondrous to relate!) forsake their Seats: Their Leaves look pale, Herbs blush with Drops of Gore; Earth groans, Dogs howl, Rocks hoarsely seem to roar. O'er all the tainted Soil black Serpents slide, And thro' the Air unbody'd Spirits glide. Frighted with Terrors, as they trembling stand She strokes their Faces with her venom'd Wand. Forthwith the Shapes of various Beasts invest Their former Forms, nor one his own possess'd.— Theobald alter'd. Ibid. Circle. This Form's eternal, and may justly claim A God-like Nature, all it's Parts the same: Alike, and equal to itself 'tis found, No End and no Beginning in a Round.— Addison. Manil. Lib. I. City Founded. —Amaz'd Æneas stands To see an ample City, where before Low Cottages appear'd: and wondring views The Gates, the Streets, and Hurry of the Place. The Tyrians urge their Work: some raise the Walls, Roll pondrous Stones, and form the Citadel: Some mark out Ground for Houses with the Plough: Laws, Judges, and an aweful Senate chuse. Others dig Ports: some deep Foundations lay For Theaters, and Pillars hew from Rocks, The stately Ornaments of future Scenes.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. I. —Here the Dido. Tyrian Queen To Juno built a stately Temple, rich With Gifts, and by the present Goddess blest. To which on Steps the brazen Thresholds rose: The Beams were bound with Brass: the Brazen Doors Jarr'd on their Hinges.— Id. Ibid. —Himself describes the Walls With a low Trench: the first Foundation lays: And, like a Fort, his City on the Shore With Banks and Battlements incloses round.— Virg. Æn. Lib. VII. —With eager Haste I lay Foundations of the long'd for Town, Call it Pergamea, and exhort our Friends, Pleas'd with their Colony's new Name, to love Their Homes, and rear a Fortress for Defence. Scarce did our Vessels, drawn within the Port, Rest on dry Land: the Youth to nuptial Rites Themselves apply'd, and till'd the new-found Soil: Laws I assign'd them, and their fix'd Abodes.— Trap. Æn. Lib. III. City Taken. See Siege. Troy taken by the Greeks. The Trojans scatter'd o'er the Walls, lye hush'd In Silence; Sleep relieves their weary Limbs.— They seize the Town, immers'd in Sleep, and Wine: Kill all the Sentries; at the open'd Gates Receive their conscious Troops, and join their Friends. Mean while, with Cries confus'd the Walls resound. —Now vanquish'd by the Fire Deiphobus' wide stately Palace falls With noisy Ruin: Next Ucalegon Blazes aloft: The broad Sigeïan Sea Glares with the Conflagration: loudly sound The Trumpet's Clangor, and the Cries of Men. The Greeks now domineer in flaming Troy. The lofty Steed amidst the City pours Arm'd Troops, whilst Others thro' the open'd Gates Arrive by thousands.— Others with Arms the Passes of the Streets Have seiz'd: their Swords with glitt'ring Blades stand drawn, Thirsting for Blood.— —Who the Horror of that Night, The Ruins and Confusion can express? Down falls the ancient City, which so long Had proudly reign'd: Thro' Houses, thro' the Streets And Temples, lifeless Carcasses, around, Lie, roll'd in Heaps: Nor do the Trojans bleed Alone: The vanquish'd in their Turn resume Their Courage, and the conq'ring Grecians fall. A Scene of Slaughter ev'ry where appears, And Terror, and a thousand Shapes of Death.— At Priam's Palace fierce the Battle burns: So fierce, as if in other Parts no War Were heard, no other Slaughter thro' the Town. Here we behold the Rage of Fight: in Crowds The Greeks, beneath a Canopy of Shields, Thick rushing onward, and the Royal Gates By Siege assaulted. Scaling Ladders hang Against the Walls: and by the Steps they strive To gain the Doors: with their Left Hands oppose Their Shields to Storms of Arrows, with their Right Grasp at the Battlements. To them adverse The Trojans tumble Roofs and Turrets down: Seeing the Worst, and in the last Extremes Of Death, such Arms they use for their Defence: Rolling down gilded Beams, the stately Pomp Of Royal Ancestors: With Swords unsheath'd, Others stand thick below, and guard the Doors. —There stood a Tower, Tall and conspicuous, with it's lofty Roof Rais'd to the Stars: From whence all Troy we view'd: This we encompass round: and with our Steel, Just where th' extremest Planks disjointed gave Easiest Access, we rend it from on high Push'd forward.—Swift with Ruin, loud with Noise, It thunders down, and on the Grecian Troops With wide Destruction falls:—But Others still Succeed them: Nor do Stones, or any Kind Of Weapons cease to fly.— In the first Portal, storming at the Door, Pyrrhus exults: with Arms and brazen Light Refulgent.— With him his Squire Automedon, and all The Syrian Youth advance: and to the Top Hurl flaming Brands.—Himself before the rest, Grasping a Battle-Ax, the stubborn Doors Bursts thro', and from their massy Hinges rends The brazen Posts: Now, having hewn the Beams, He splits their solid Timber, and a Gap Discloses wide.—Th' interior Court appears: Long Galleries, Priam's Rooms of State, and all Th' imperial Pomp of ancient Kings they see, And Sentries standing at the Doors in Arms. But with confus'd Laments, the inner Rooms, With Tumult, Noise, and wild Distraction, sound: The ecchoing Palace rings with female Shrieks, And the shrill Clamour beats the golden Stars. From Place to Place the trembling Matrons run, Thro' the vast Court: and cling, and hug, and kiss The Pillars. Pyrrhus with his Father's Fire Still pushes on: nor can the Bars, or Guards Sustain his Fury: To the batt'ring Rams The Gate gives Way: and from their Hinges torn The solid Posts lie flat. A spacious Breach Is made: the thronging Greeks break in: then kill The first they meet: and with arm'd Soldiers croud The rich Apartments.— These Eyes saw Pyrrhus raging, smear'd with Gore, And both th' Atridæ in the Entrance storm: Amidst an hundred Daughters saw the Queen And Priam, on the Altars, with his Blood Pollute the hallow'd Fires, which he himself Had consecrated.— —Outragious Pyrrhus, Then drag'd old Priam to the sacred Hearth, Trembling, and sliding, on the slipp'ry Ground, In his Son's Blood: and, twisting in his Hair His Left Hand, with the Right his glitt'ring Sword Deep to the Hilt he plunges in his Side. All Ilium now I saw among the Fires Sinking lie flat: and from it's Bottom turn'd Down falls Neptunian Troy. As when an Ash, Aged, and tall, is on the Mountains hewn By Rusticks: who in Emulation strive With Strokes of Axes, and repeated Steel To overturn it: oft it nods, and shakes It's leafy Top, still tott'ring, till at length Subdu'd by Wounds, it groans it's last, and torn From the high Ridge, with cumbrous Ruin falls.— Trap.

Returns of Love, or Favour, seek I none: Nor give thy Life to bargain for my own.— So saying, on the instant he commands, To loose the galling Fetters from his Hands.— Id. Lucan. Lib. II. Combat. Duel. —Turbulent in Ire, With his long Spear Mezentius takes the Field: Huge as Orion, when on Foot he stalks, Cutting his Way thro' the wide liquid Realms Of Nereus, and surmounts the topmost Waves With Shoulders tall:— So in vast Arms Mezentius tow'rs sublime. Thro' the long Ranks when him Æneas spies, To meet him he prepares: the Other fix'd And fearless waits, expecting the Approach Of his brave Foe: and in his own Bulk stands. Then having measur'd with his Eyes the Space Fit for his Jav'lin's Reach: Assist me now, My own Right Hand, and Thou, my missive Lance, You are the only Gods that I invoke. He said: and hurl'd the hissing Dart from far, Which flying glances from the Target's Orb. Then good Æneas throws a Spear, which flies Swift thro' the hollow Orb of triple Brass, Thro' the tough Linnen folds, and three Bulls Hides Convolv'd: the Point stands fix'd within his Groin.— Trap. Æn. Lib. X. —Thus Turnus to his Friends: Desist You from the Battle, and retire: Pallas I meet alone: To Me alone Pallas is due: O! were his Father here Spectator of the Fight! He said: His Friends Form the commanded List, and clear the Field. At their Retreat, and at Those proud Commands, The Royal Youth, in Wonder, and Amaze, Stands fix'd on Turnus: rolls his Eyes around, And with stern Aspect his huge Bulk surveys. Then to th' insulting Chief these Words returns: Or I this Day will reap the Fame of Spoils Illustrious won, or of a glorious Death: For either Chance my Father stands prepar'd: Forbear thy Threats:—This said, he takes the Field. Turnus his Chariot quits: on Foot prepares For closer Fight. As when a Lion spies From a high Rock a Bull upon the Plain, Standing aloof, and meditating War: Forward he springs: Not diff'rent was the Port Of Turnus, and his Figure, as he walk'd. When Pallas thought within his Jav'lin's reach His Foe advanc'd: He first begins th' Assault: With mighty Strength the trembling Weapon hurls, And from it's Scabbard draws his shining Sword. On his high Shoulder lights the flying Spear: And passing thro' the Shield's extreamest Edge, The Body of great Turnus slightly raz'd. Turnus a Lance prefix'd with sharpen'd Steel Long poising, darts it, and Thus speaks: Now see Whether our Weapon can more deeply wound. He said: And, driv'n with forceful Swing from far, Thro' the mid Shield, so many Plates of Brass, So many Iron Folds, and tough Bull Hides The Jav'lin makes it's Way: and pierces sheer The Corslet's Mail, and bores his mighty Breast. He wrenches out the reeking Point in vain: Thro' the same Orifice the Blood, and Soul Issue at once: He falls upon his Wound: His Armour o'er him rings: With gory Mouth He gasps in Death, and bites the hostile Plain. Then o'er him Turnus speaks: Arcadians, to Evander (mark my Words) This Message bear: Just such as he deserv'd To be restor'd, his Pallas I restore. The Honour of a Tomb, whate'er it be, And all the Solace which a Grave can yield, I frankly give: yet dearly has he bought His Trojan Guest's Alliance. Having spoke, With his left Foot the breathless Corps he press'd: Snatching with eager Haste the pondrous Belt, And on it that dire Argument engrav'd, So many Youths in one connubial Night Dispatch'd; and bridal Beds besmear'd with Gore: Which good Eurytion's Art had carv'd in Gold. This Trophy now, with recent Conquest crown'd, Turnus enjoys, and in proud Triumph wears.— Trap. Æn. Lib. X. Thou, Idmon, to the Phrygian Tyrant bear (No Joy to Him) this Message. The Challenge from Turnus to Æneas.—Soon as Morn, Fresh in her rosy Car shall paint the Sky: Let him not lead his Trojans to the Fight: Let Trojans and Rutulians from their Arms Desist:—His Blood and Mine decide the War. The Trojans and Rutulians for the Fight A Cirque before the lofty Walls describe. Th' Ausonian Legions march: and Iron Troops Pour from the crouded Gates. To them oppos'd The Trojan, and the Tyrrhene Squadrons rush, In various Arms: nor rang'd less in Array Than if the rigid Labour of the War Had call'd them to the Field. The Chiefs themselves, Amidst the Thousands, thro' th' embattl'd Lines Ride round, all rich in Purple, and in Gold.— —When now (the Signal giv'n) All to their Posts allotted were retir'd: They fix their Spears in Earth, and rest their Shields. The longing Matrons, and the feeble Sires, And unarm'd Vulgar, load the Houses-Tops, And Tow'rs: or crouding fill the lofty Gates. And now, the furious Turnus and Æneas. Combatants at once, With rapid Onset, darting missive Spears, Begin the Fight with Shields and sounding Brass. The Earth beneath them groans: Then various Strokes In closer Conflict, furious, They repeat. Turnus imagining his Blow secure, Now forward springs with all his Body's Force, And waves his glitt'ring Sword uprais'd in Air, And strikes his Foe. The Trojans loud exclaim: The Latins tremble: And the Bands of Both Stand fix'd, expecting. But the faithless Blade Breaks short: and in the middle of the Stroke Deserts him. Nothing now but Flight remains For Aid: More swift than Eastern Winds he flies, Soon as he sees the unaccustom'd Hilt, And his Right Hand disarm'd. With Fear confus'd He traverses the Field: now here, now there Doubles in doubtful Mazes: For all round The Trojan Lines embattl'd hemm'd him in, Here a vast Lake, and there the lofty Walls. Æneas presses on his trembling Foe With eager Haste, and Step by Step pursues. Now Clamours rise: the Banks and Lakes around Reply: And Heav'n all thunders to the Noise. He flying chides his ling'ring Friends, and calls On each by Name, to bring his faithful Sword. Æneas opposite denounces Ruin Instant, and Death, if any dares approach. Five Orbs involv'd, five Windings they compleat, This Way, and That: For now no trivial Prize Is sought: For Turnus Life, or Blood they strive. An old wild Olive Tree by Chance there stood With bitter Leaves: to Faunus sacred held: Hither Æneas Jav'lin flew: here fix'd It stood: and in the stubborn Root remain'd. He kneeling tugs, and strives to disengage The Steel: and with his missive Spear to reach Whom in the swift Pursuit he could not seize. There while he tugs and sweats: again transform'd Into the Charioteer Metiscus Shape, The Daunian Goddess to her Brother runs Assisting, and his trusty Sword restores. Now Both, sublime in Courage, and with Arms Refitted, one confiding in his Sword, The Other rising to his brandish'd Spear, Stand opposite: and panting urge the Fight. Æneas shaking his long ashen Spear Urges adverse: and Thus relentless speaks. What, Turnus, now is the Delay? or what Dost Thou revolve? No Hope of Flight remains: Arms must decide the Strife: To every Shape Transform thy self: Collect thy utmost Force, Whate'er thou canst in Art, or Courage: Wish For Wings to bear thee to the Stars aloft: Or hide thyself in op'ning Earth below.— The Hero shook his Head, and thus reply'd: Not thy proud Threats, insulting Man, affright My Soul: Me Heav'n affrights, and Jove my Foe. No more he spoke: But looking round espy'd A pondrous Stone, which then by Chance there lay, An antique, pond'rous Stone, a Landmark plac'd, To part the Limits of th' adjoining Fields. With trembling Hands he rising lifts it high, Runs stagg'ring forward, and against his Foe Tosses th' enormous Load: but neither knows Himself, when running, nor when stagg'ring on, Nor poising in his Hands th' unweildy Weight. His Knees fail tott'ring; and his Blood congeals. The Stone then rolling thro' the empty Space Drops short, nor reaches to the destin'd Mark. Then various Passions struggle in his Breast: The City and the Latian Host he views, Wavers with Fear, and dreads the coming Dart: Perceives no Way for Flight, no Strength to move Against the Foe.— While thus perplex'd he stands, Æneas shakes The mortal Dart: and, having with his Eyes Mark'd out the destin'd Wound, with all his Force Collected, hurls the missive Death from far. Stones shot from mural Engines with less Sound Roar thro' the Air: nor breaks so loud a Crash From bursting Thunder: Like a Whirlwind flies The Fate-conveying Spear, and opens wide The Corslet's Border, and the seven fold Shield's Extremest Orbs: and whizzing passes sheer Thro' his mid Thigh. Down lofty Turnus falls, Wounded, on doubl'd Knee, and bent to Earth. A gen'ral Groan runs thro' th' Ausonian Host: The Mountain round rebellows: and the Woods Echoing return the Noise.—Furious in Arms Æneas stood, rolling his Eyes around, And check'd his lifted Hand.—And now his Soul Still more and more relented, as he paus'd: When on the vanquish'd Champion's Shoulder high With well known Bosses shone the fatal Belt Of youthful Pallas: whom with mortal Wound Turnus, unhappy Victor, struck to Earth, And on his Shoulder wore the hostile Spoils. Those Spoils the Trojan Hero having view'd, The fresh Incentives of his Grief and Rage: Inflam'd with Vengeance, terrible in Ire, Shalt Thou, thus deck'd with Trophies of my Friends Escape from Me?—'Tis Pallas, Pallas gives This Wound, and from thy execrable Blood Demands this Sacrifice of just Revenge. Thus while he spoke, beneath his Breast adverse Furious he plung'd the Sword: the vital Heat Leaves his slack Limbs: And to the Shades below With Indignation flies his groaning Soul.— Trap. Æn. Lib. XII. Comets. Whether from Earth the active Seeds of Flame May rise on high, and fiery Comets frame, Or Emanations from the Stars may fly, And join to form them, blazing thro' the Sky: Or God, in pity to our mortal State, Hangs out these Lights, to shew approaching Fate: They never shine in vain, but still presage Some coming Plague on the unhappy Age. No Crop rewards the cheated Farmer's Toil, He mourns, and curses the ungrateful Soil: The meager Ox to the successless Plow He yokes, and scarce dares make another Vow: Or wasting Plagues their deadly Poisons spread, And wide extend the Empire of the Dead: Then Heaps on Heaps unhappy Mortals fall, And mighty Cities make one Funeral.— Creech. Manil. Lib. I. So threatning Comets glaring from an high With sanguine Beams, dart swiftly thro' the Sky: They stream a ruddy Trail, and, not in vain, The Sailor fears them on the watry Plain, And trembling Nations dread the long malignant Train. The bearded Blaze th' impending Ill foreshows Of wrecking Tempests, or invading Foes.— Hughes. Claud. Rapt. Pros. —As when in Night serene, Ensanguin'd Comets shoot a dismal Glare: Or the red Dog-Star, rising on the World, To wretched Mortals threatens Dearth and Plagues, With baleful Light: and saddens all the Sky.— Trap. Æn. Lib. X. Compassion. See Clemency. Compassion proper to Mankind appears, Which Nature witness'd when she lent us Tears: Of tender Sentiments We only give Those Proofs:—to weep is our Prerogative: To shew by pitying Looks, and melting Eyes, How with a suff'ring Friend we sympathize. Nature commands a Sigh, when in the Street, With some fair blooming Virgin's Hearse we meet, Or Infant's Funeral.— Tate. Juv. Sat. XV. —His moving Sighs controul Our rising Rage, and soften ev'ry Soul.— Pit. Virg. Æn. Lib. II. Touch'd with the moving Eloquence of Tears, His Life we gave him, and dispell'd his Fears.— Id. Ibid. But when Anchises' Son his Visage saw, His Lausus slain by Æneas in the Defence of his Father Mezentius. Visage wondrous Pale, and chang'd in Death: Deeply he groan'd with Pity, and his Hand Extended, as he fell: and to his Thoughts The Image soft of filial Piety Itself presented. What, ill-fated Youth! What Honours, by such mighty Virtue claim'd, To thy Deserts can good Æneas pay? The Arms, which pleas'd Thee living, still be thine: And to thy Parents' Manes, and their Dust (If aught That Care sollicit thee in Death) Thy breathless Corps I willingly restore. And let this Thought console thy rigid Doom, By great Æneas' Hand Thou fall'st. At once He chides his ling'ring Friends, and from the Ground Uplifts him, with his Tresses, form'd by Art, All foul in Dust, and clung with clotted Gore.— Trap. Æn. Lib. X. Competency. See Content. Nature content with Little. If what's enough for Man, enough could be, This were sufficient: but as this, we see, Is not enough, how can we e'er believe That Riches to the Mind Content can give?— Anon. Lucil. The Farmer, lab'ring, with the Iron Share Turns up the churlish Soil: the Tradesman cheats: The hardy Mariner, and Soldier, roam To ev'ry Region, fearless of the Seas:— These Toils they undergo, that having gain'd A Competency, and from Want secure, All Business laid aside, old Age may pass In Ease and Quiet.— Hor. Lib. I. Sat. 1. If any ask me what would satisfy To make Life easy, thus I would reply: As much as keeps out Hunger, Thirst, and Cold, Or what contented Socrates of old: As much as made wise Epicurus blest, Who in small Gardens spacious Realms possess'd. This is what Nature's Wants may well suffice; He that would more, is covetous, not wise.— Dryden jun. Juv. Sat. XIV. —Much will always wanting be To those who much desire: thrice happy He, To whom the wise Indulgency of Heaven, With sparing Hand, but just enough has given.— Cowley. Hor. Lib. III. Ode 24. Most by their own false Hopes deceiv'd, cry out, They have not yet enough.— —My Friend complain no more: He that hath needful Things can ne'er be poor. If with good Food and Cloathing thou art stor'd, Not more than this can kingly Wealth afford.— Creech alter'd. Hor. Lib. I. Epist. 12. Complaisance. Her Wishes never, nor her Will withstand: Submit, You conquer: serve, and you'll command. Her Words approve, deny what she denies, Like where she likes, and where she scorns, despise. Laugh when she smiles, when sad, dissolve in Tears: Let ev'ry Gesture sympathize with hers. If she delights, as Women will, in play, Her Stakes return, your ready Losings pay. When she's at Cards, or rattling Dice she throws, Connive at Cheats, and generously lose. A smiling Winner let the Nymph remain, Let your pleas'd Mistress ev'ry Conquest gain. In Heat with an Umbrello ready stand: When walking offer your officious Hand. Her trembling Hands, tho' You sustain the Cold, Cherish, and to your warmer Bosom hold. Think no inferior Office a Disgrace: No Action, that a Mistress gains, is base. Whene'er she wants a Messenger, away, Business defer, let nought your Speed delay. When late from Supper she's returning home, And calls her Servant, as a Servant come.— Dryden. Ovid. Art. 2. Then for his Conversation: he was never uneasy upon any occasion, nor would he ever spoil Company, but clos'd with all Humours, never thwarting others, nor assuming too much to himself. And I think this was the Way to get Reputation and Friends without Envy.— Eachard. Ter. Andr. Complaisance goes current, when Plain-dealing will not pass.— Id. Ter. Andr. Concord. See Peace. Kind Concord, heav'nly born! whose blissful Reign Holds this vast Globe in one surrounding Chain, Whose Laws the jarring Elements controul, And knit each Atom close from Pole to Pole: Soul of the World! and Love's eternal Spring!— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. IV. Conscience. (Evil.) See Guilt. He that commits a Sin, shall quickly find The pressing Guilt lie heavy on his Mind: Tho' Bribes or Favour should assert his Cause, Pronounce him guiltless, and elude the Laws: None quits himself: his own impartial Thought Will damn, and Conscience will record the Fault.— Creech. Juv. Sat. XIII. But why must those be thought to 'scape, who feel Those Rods of Scorpions, and those Whips of Steel Which Conscience shakes, when she with Rage controuls, And spreads amazing Terrors thro' their Souls.— Id. Nor sharp Revenge, nor Hell itself can find A fiercer Torment than a guilty Mind: Which Day and Night doth dreadfully accuse, The Wretch condemns, and still the Charge renews.— Id. Ibid. Sleep flies the Wretch: or when with Cares opprest, His oft turn'd Limbs are weary'd into Rest, Then Dreams invade, the injur'd Gods appear, All arm'd with Thunder, and awake his Fear. Such Wretches start at ev'ry Flash that flies, Grow pale at the first Murmur of the Skies, E'er Clouds are form'd, and Thunder roars, afraid.— Id. Ibid. Ev'n Here, on Earth, the Guilty have in view The mighty Pains to mighty Mischiefs due: Racks, Prisons, Poisons, the Tarpeian Rock, Stripes, Hangmen, Pitch, and suffocating Smoak, And last, and most, if these were cast behind, Th' avenging Horrors of a conscious Mind: Whose deadly Fear anticipates the Blow, And sees no End of Punishment and Woe: But looks for more, at the last Gasp of Breath:— This makes a Hell on Earth, and Life a Death.— Creech. Lucret. Lib. III. Each as his Hands in Guilt have been embrew'd, By hellish Horror ever is pursu'd. Ah! who can tell those agonizing Pains, Which Day and Night the guilty Mind sustains! Vengeance, with all her dreadful Pomp, attends: To Wheels she binds him, and with Vultures rends, With Racks of Conscience, and with Whips of Fiends.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. VII. So raving Pentheus Troops of Furies sees, Two Suns, and double Thebes: So mad with Guilt Orestes, agitated on the Stage, Flies from his Mother's Ghost with Torches arm'd, And black infernal Snakes: revengeful Fiends Sit in the Doors, and intercept his Flight.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. IV. Conscience. (Good.) See Man Upright. What's Man's chief Good? From Guilt a Conscience free.— Bias per Aus. Be this thy Guard, be this thy strong Defence: A virtuous Heart, and unstain'd Innocence: Not to be conscious of a shameful Sin, Nor e'er turn pale for scarlet Crimes within.— Creech. Hor. Lib. I. Epist. 1. Within the conscious Breast of every Man, As good, or bad, his Course of Life has been, So Hope, or Fear prevails.— Ovid. Fast. Lib. I. A Man that's Good and Wise will boldly say, Well, Pentheus King of Thebes, Why this Delay? Pray what must I expect? What must I fear? What undeserv'd must I be forc'd to bear? I'll take away thy Goods.—My Flocks, My Land, You may,—'tis subject all to your Command. I'll chain and rob thee of thy Liberty.— But God, whene'er I please, will set me free.— Creech. Hor. L.I. Ep. 16. Innocence may be bold, and vindicate itself with Assurance, and speak out confidently.— Plaut. Amph. Consolation. Let Patience moderate thy Grief, he cries; Nor think Thyself unfortunate alone, But learn by Others Woes, to bear thine own.— Ovid. Met. Lib. XV. —The Chief With Words of Comfort sooths the common Grief:— O Friends! he cries, experienc'd in Distress, Much worse have We endur'd:— And Heav'n will likewise put an End to this. Courage assume: ev'n this Affliction, past, May in Remembrance yield Us Joy at last. With manly Patience bear your present State, And save your selves to meet a better Fate.— Dryd. alter'd. Virg. Æn. Lib. I. If so the Gods Pompey. my Overthrow ordain, And the fierce Victor chace me o'er the Plain, Thou shalt be left me still, my better Part, To sooth my Cares, and heal my broken Heart: Thy open Arms I shall be sure to meet, And fly with Pleasure to the dear Retreat.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. V. No Day is drench'd with such perpetual Rain, But that some Intermission glads the Plain: No barren Soil's so bad, but that it shows Some useful Plant beneath it's Briars grows: No Life's so fill'd with Woes, but that between Some Gleams of Joy shine thro' the gloomy Scene.— Ovid. Lib. IV. Pont. 4. Still on your Bloom shall endless Sorrow prey, And waste your Youth in Solitude away? And shall no pleasing Theme your Thoughts employ? The pratling Infant, or the bridal Joy? Think you such Cares disturb your Husband's Shade, Or stir the sacred Ashes of the Dead?— Pitt. Æn. Lib. IV. The Merchant shipwreck'd on the faithless Main, Seeks out some shipwreck'd Wretch to share his Grief: By sudden Storms undone, the ruin'd Swain Finds in some Other's Ruin sad Relief. Affliction's Friendship mutual Fun'rals move: Together childless Parents mix their Sighs. Then let's the Power of joint Orisons prove: Associate Pray'rs wing swiftest to the Skies.— Add. jun. Petr. Arb. Frag. Who'd be so mad a Mother to disswade From Tears, whilst on his Hearse her Son is laid? But when Grief's Deluge can no longer swell, Declining Sorrow you'll with ease repell.— Tate. Ovid Remed. Lib. I. Constancy. See Affection Conjugal. Since poor Sichœus, by my Brother slain, Dash'd with his Blood the consecrated Fane, And stain'd the Gods: my firm Resolves, I own, This graceful Prince has shook, and this alone. I feel a Warmth o'er all my trembling Frame, Too like the Tokens of my former Flame. But Oh! may Earth her dreadful Gulph display, And gaping snatch me from the golden Day: May I be hurl'd, by Heav'n's Almighty Sire, Transfix'd with Thunder, and involv'd in Fire, Down to the Shades of Hell, from Realms of Light, The deep, deep Shades of everlasting Night: E'er, sacred Honour, I betray thy Cause, In Word, or Thought, or violate thy Laws. No!—my first Lord, my first ill-fated Spouse, Still, as in Life, is Lord of all my Vows. My Love he had, and ever let him have, Interr'd with him, and bury'd in the Grave— Pitt. Æn. Lib. IV. Content. See Discontent. Let the rich Miser gather golden Gain, And live the large Possessor of the Plain: Whom Fears perpetual scare with neighb'ring Foes, While sounding Trumpets wake his soft Repose. To me the Fates with sparing Hand dispence, The humbler Sweets of Ease and Innocence: Pleas'd with the Joys of a secure Retreat, While constant Fires supply the chearful Seat. I nor paternal Wealth, nor Fields require, Nor Harvests, bounteous to my wealthy Sire: A small Estate my humble Wish can please, And a soft Bed to stretch my Limbs at Ease.— Dart. Tibul. Lib. I. Eleg. 1. My little Grove, my limpid Stream, My certain Harvest, render me More blest, more truly blest, than He That wears rich Africk's Diadem.— Horat. Lib. III. Ode 16. He that desires but what's enough, Against the Pow'r of Fate is proof: Let raging Tempests toss the Floods, Or Whirlwinds roar among the Woods: Let patt'ring Hail his Vineyard Spoil, And render fruitless all his Toil, Or let his injur'd Trees complain, Of too much Drought, or too much Rain, Or let his Field deceive his Hopes, And Frosts untimely nip his Crops.— Creech alter'd. Hor. Lib. III. Ode 1. Those Hours the Gods bestow with Thanks employ, Nor long defer the Bliss Thou may'st enjoy: For as 'tis Prudence, and not change of Air, Must render Life a Blessing any where, Those that beyond Sea go will sadly find, They change their Climate only, not their Mind. A busy Idleness destroys our Ease: We ride, and sail, in Search of inward Peace: Yet what we seek we ev'ry where may find, If We can gain but a contented Mind.— Creech alter'd. Hor. Lib. I. Epist. 11. Bless Me from Poverty and Sordidness! Then be the Gifts of Fortune more, or less, I'll rest content. To me it matters not, Whether I'm carry'd in a little Boat, Or in a Ship.—Since neither driving Gales, Too swiftly urge me on with swelling Sails, Nor do rough Waves and Tempests on the Main, Beat in my Teeth, and force me back again.— For Strength, Wit, Honour, Virtue, I am plac'd Short of the Foremost, but before the Last.— J. D. alter'd. Horat. Lib. II. Epist. 2. These were my Pray'rs to Heav'n, for These my Vows; A small Estate, a Fountain near my House, A Garden, and a little Grove of Trees; And the good Gods have giv'n me more than These.— 'Tis well: nor other Happiness I wish, But only that they would continue This.— Creech alter'd. Hor. Lib. II. Sat. 6. Cottage. See Hospitality. Here shone no Iv'ry Roofs inlay'd with Gold, No Marble Floors oppress'd th' illuded Mould: But banded Sheaves of empty Ceres, laid On hurdled Boughs, the humble Cov'ring made. Cheap earthen Bowls in homely Order stood, And a full Pitcher from the limpid Flood, With Osier Baskets of a rustic Twine, And an old Cask still foul with Lees of Wine. The Walls were stubbled Mud, heap'd up in Haste, O'er which the Reed and Bulrush droop'd, disgrac'd. Within the Hut a smoaky Pole was slung, From Side to Side, cross which it's Treasures hung: Apples, and wither'd Sav'ry dangled down, With Grapes dispos'd in many a rural Crown.— Addison jun. Petron. Arb. Countenance. When we are touch'd with some important Ill, How vainly Silence would our Grief conceal. Sorrow nor Joy can be disguis'd by Art; Our Foreheads blab the Secrets of our Heart.— Harvey. Juv. Sat. IX. Country Life. See Peasant. Like the first Mortals happy He, Whose Oxen plow his own paternal Plain: From Hurry and Fatigue of Bus'ness free, And quite a Stranger to usurious Gain. Him, nor the rattling Trumpet calls to War, Nor does the roaring Ocean scare: The Bar he shuns: nor meanly stoops to wait At the proud Levees of the lordly Great. Or, his Amusement is to twine Round the tall Poplar the embracing Vine: Or, useless Branches cutting clear away, He grafts a better Kind than they. Or, climbing up some hilly Steep, Thro' the long Vales his lowing Herds he sees: Or, presses into Jars the Labour of his Bees; Or, sheers his over-burden'd Sheep. Or else, when Autumn crown'd with golden Ears, And full ripe Apples, rears her graceful Head: Delighted much he plucks the grafted Pears, And lushious Grapes that with Purple overspread Beneath some ancient Oak he likes to lie, Or on the Turf enjoys the open Sky: While the deep River gently glides along, The Groves ring round the Birds melodious Song, The limpid Brooks roll on their thrilling Streams, Inviting soft Repose and pleasing Dreams. But when the Blasts of Winter blow, And gentle Show'rs are turn'd to Snow, With Dogs, the Boar, a furious Prey, He drives to Toils that stop the Way; Or, slily, spreads around the Bush, His Nets to catch the greedy Thrush: Or fearful Hares, or dainty Cranes, In Gins ensnar'd, reward his Pains. While thus amus'd what Lover must not lose The sad Remembrance of his Cares and Woes? But if a chaste, good-natur'd Wife, Divides with him the Cares of Life, With constant Diligence does oversee His hopeful Children and his Family: (Like some old Sabine, or Apulian Dame, Sun-burnt, and swarthy, but of honest Fame.) A chearful Fire she gets, against he come, Weary with Sport, or Labour, home: The Flock she folds, and milks the Kine; With unbought Dainties spreads the Board: With what the Fields and Yard afford, And from the Hogshead draws the racy Wine. Amidst these Feasts how pleasant to behold The full fed Flocks home hasting to the Fold: Whilst loud the weary Oxen low, And slow along the Ground trails the inverted Plow! Their Labour done, to see the Swains carouse, While Mirth, and Jokes, and Laughter shake the House.— Hor. Epod. 2. There's none can live so innocent and free, Or follow Nature's Laws, so close, as he, Who, far from Cities, does securely dwell, Fond of the Country, in some humble Cell. Whose happy Life is thus obscurely spent, No wretched Avarice can e'er torment: No Praise he covets, from the giddy Throng, Who to the Good are seldom constant long: Destructive Envy ne'er comes near his Gate, Nor the frail Favour of th' unsteady Great. No Courts he follows, nor, a royal Slave, Seeks he vain Titles, or does Riches crave. Exempt from ev'ry Hope and ev'ry Fear, Scarce, even Malice, can assault him here. Black Crimes in Cities bred he does not know, Nor when the People rage,— Does his clear Conscience dread the threat'ned Blow. Sen. Hipp. Would You a House for Happiness erect, Let Nature be herself the Architect: She'll build it more convenient than great, And doubtless in the Country chuse her Seat. What other Place can better Helps supply, Against the Force of Winter's Cruelty? Where does a more refreshing Air asswage, The Dog-Star's Fury, or the Lion's Rage? Or where, ah where, but here, can Sleep maintain Devoid of Care, her soft imperial Reign? Is Lybian Marble press'd beneath thy Feet, More beautiful than Flow'rs, or half so sweet? Or Water roaring thro' the bursting Lead, So pure, as murm'ring in it's native Bed? Who builds in Cities yet the Fields approves, And hedges in with Pillars awkard Groves: Strives for the Country View that farthest runs, And tweers aloof at Beauties which he shuns. In driving Nature out our Force is vain, Still the recoiling Goddess comes again: And creeps in silent Triumph, to deride The weak Attempts of Luxury and Pride.— Cowley alter'd. Hor. Lib. I. Epist. 10. Ah wisely now, and willingly retire! Forsake the gaudy Tinsel of the Great: The peaceful Cottage beckens a Retreat; Where true Content a solid Comfort brings, To Kings unknown, or Favourites of Kings.— Ibid. Courtship. See Complaisance. Flattery. An Elm was near, to whose Embraces led, A curling Vine her swelling Clusters spread: He view'd their twining Branches with Delight, And prais'd the Beauty of the pleasing Sight. Yet this tall Elm, but for this Vine, he said, Had stood neglected, and a barren Shade: And this fair Vine, but that her Arms surround Her marry'd Elm, had crept along the Ground. But no Example thy hard Heart can move, Still, still averse to all the Joys of Love.— Pope. Ovid. Met. Lib. XIV. Bright Youth, she cries, whom all thy Features prove A God: and if a God, the God of Love: But if a Mortal, blest thy Nurse's Breast, Thy Father, Mother, Brother, Sister blest: But, oh how blest! how more than blest thy Bride! Ally'd in Bliss, if any yet ally'd. If so, let mine the stol'n Enjoyment be: If not, behold a willing Bride in me.— Addison. Ovid. Met. Lib. IV. Too much the Youth does in his Beauty trust, Who thinks the Fair, will speak her Passion first: With humble Pray'rs his Suit the Man should move: The Maid with Complaisance accept his Love. Ask, and be happy: freely speak your Mind: And yield a fair Occasion to be kind.— Ovid. de Art. Amandi. Lib. I. You, who in Cupid's Lists inroll your Name, First, seek an Object worthy of your Flame: Then strive the charming Fair one's Heart to gain: Be next your Care, that Love may long remain.— Dryden alter'd. Firmly believe all Women may be won: Attempt with Confidence, the Work is done. The Grashopper shall first forbear to sing In Summer Season, and the Birds in Spring: The Hound shall sooner, frighted, turn away From the weak Hare, its long accustom'd Prey, Than Woman stand against Man's flatt'ring Skill: Ev'n she will yield, who swears she never will.— Dryden alter'd. Ibid. By Letters, not by Words, your Suit begin: And ford the doubtful Passage with your Pen. If to her Heart you'd find the nearest Way, Extreamly flatter, and extreamly pray. Priam by Pray'rs did Hector's Body gain, Nor is an angry God invok'd in vain.— Dryden. Ibid. When to the Play she goes be ever nigh, And gaze, with Love and Wonder in your Eye. Admire the Dancer who her Liking gains, And pity him who acts the Lover's Pains: Sit while she sits, and when she rises rise, And for her sake the Loss of Time despise.— Dryd. alter'd. Ibid. Act well the Lover: let your Speech abound In dying Words, expressive of your Wound. Nor doubt You her Belief: She will be mov'd: The plainest thinks she merits to be lov'd.— Dryd. alter'd. Ibid. Be first to snatch the Goblet from her Lip, And where she laid her Lips the Blessing sip: Whate'er she touches with her Fingers, eat: And brush her Hand in reaching to the Meat.— Paleness becomes not those who sail the Sea, Brown'd by the Sun and Waves they ought to be: Nor suits it those, who all the Seasons round, With Ploughs and Harrows turn the stubborn Ground: Nor You, who seek by Arms to gain Renown, Can, with pale Looks, become the Victor's Crown: But if the Lover hopes to be in Grace, Exceeding wan, and meager be his Face: Paleness is apt, and decent in his Case. That Colour from the Fair Compassion draws, She thinks you sick, and thinks herself the Cause. Then, tho' in Health, be not asham'd to wear, And, with thy Night-Cap, hide thy seemly Hair. If Cares and Woes attending Love should fail, Sit up whole Nights, and study to be pale. Unhappy be, in order to be blest, And let each Look bespeak a Love-sick Breast.— Ibid. Beg her, with Tears, your fond Desires to grant; For Tears will pierce a Heart of Adamant. If Tears will not be squeez'd, then rub your Eye, Or wet the Lids, and seem at least to cry.— Dryden. Trust not your beauteous Form, but learn to know, There's more requir'd in Love than empty Show: Debates avoid, and rude Contention shun, Mild Love is with submissive Language won. With tender Vows the charming Maid endear, And let her only Sighs and Wishes hear. Contrive with Words and Actions to delight, And make your self still Welcome in her Sight.— Dryden alter'd. I no profuse nor costly Gifts commend, But chuse, and time it well, whate'er You send. Thro' ev'ry Season of the fruitful Year, Let your own Boy some rural Present bear: Tell her 'tis fresh, and from your Manor brought, Tho' stale, and in the Suburb Market bought. The first ripe Cluster let the Fair One eat, And her with Apples, Nuts, and Chesnuts treat. To her the Thrush, to her the Garland send, As certain Proofs she's always in your Mind. By Arts like these the Childless Miser's caught: Thus future Legacies are basely bought. But may they meet with Punishment divine, Who make their Presents with a bad Design!— Dryd. alter'd. Ovid. Art. Amand. Lib. 2. In Autumn oft, when the delightful Year Purples the Grape, and shows the Vintage near, Fierce Heats, by turns, and chilly Blasts arise, And bodies languish with inconstant Skies. Then, if the vitious Air infects her Veins, And in her tainted Blood some Fever reigns, Your tender Love, by your Behaviour show, And if you e'er expect to reap, then sow. Think nothing nauseous in her loath'd Disease, But with your ready Hand contrive to please: Weep in her Sight, more ardent Kisses give, And let her burning Lips your Tears receive. Much for her Safety vow, and loudly speak, That she may hear the lavish Vows you make: Often pretend to dream that she is well, And the feign'd Dream to her with Pleasure tell. Cares thus well tim'd shall stand you in good stead: And this Way many climb the nuptial Bed.— Dryd. alter'd. Ibid. Cow. —Best the Cow Of Aspect sour: her Head unshap'd and large, Her hanging Neck enormous: from her Chin Her swagging Dewlaps to her Knees depend. Her Flank of Length unmeasur'd: all Parts huge: Her Feet too: and beneath her crankled Horns Her Ears uncouth and rough. Nor shall her Form Be disapprov'd, whose Skin with Spots of white Is vary'd: or who struggles with the Yoke, And sometimes pushes with the Horn, in Front A Bull resembles, tall, and big all o'er, And with her Tail, in walking, sweeps the Ground. Their Age for just Connubials fit, begins After four Years: before the Tenth, expires: The rest unapt for Teeming, and of Strength Unequal to the Plough.— Trap. Virg. Georg. Lib. III. Creation. See Chaos. God. First, that the Earth might regular appear, He rounds the Figure to a perfect Sphere: Then bad the Sea to roll:—and Winds he gave To swell the Surges of the rising Wave: The rising Wave commission'd to explore The compass'd Earth, and bound it with a Shore. The running Springs he adds, and standing Lakes, And bounding Banks for winding Rivers makes: Earth drinks in some; the rest their watry Train Roll on, and pour their Treasures in the Main: Where, in their narrow Banks confin'd no more, They freer rage, and lash the sounding Shore. He bad the Woods be cloth'd, the Plains extend, Subside the Vallies, and the Rocks ascend. The spacious Fields of Air, suspended high, Inclose the Ball, and skirt it with the Sky: Weighty, with Fire, with Earth compared, light, The winged Air between them takes it's Flight. Thick Clouds o'erspread, and Storms engender there, And Thunder's Voice, which wretched Mortals fear, And Winds with Lightnings mixt, thence shiv'ring Winter bear. Far above these, in Order and in Place, The wise Creator fix'd the heav'nly Space; Fields of pure Æther, from all Dregs refin'd, By Earth unclogg'd, and by no Bounds confin'd. Scarce had he all in proper Limits fix'd, When, long depress'd and with Confusion mix'd, Each Star upshot it's explicated Head, And Heav'ns wide Arch with new born Glories spread. Then, that no Void in Nature might appear, With Stars and Forms divine he fill'd the heav'nly Sphere: The glitt'ring Fishes to the Floods repair: Beasts to the Earth: and Birds possess the Air. Man too was made.— Sewel. Dryden. alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. I. —He sung, how thro' the mighty Void The Seeds of Earth, and Water, Air, and Fire, Consolidated met: how first from These The Elements, and the World's recent Globe Compounded rose: how then the firmer Soil Grew hard, and in it's Channel shut the Sea, And by Degrees, of various Things receiv'd Th' unnumber'd Species:—how the Earth admir'd To see the new-born Sun with Glory shine: How Show'rs from high-hung Clouds distill'd: when first The Woods began to rise: and thin, dispers'd, The Animals o'er unknown Mountains rov'd.— Trap. Virg. Ecl. VI. Cruelty. See Inhumanity. He Tereus ravished Philomela his Wife's Sister, and cut out her Tongue, to prevent her being able to discover it. drew the Faulchion that beside him hung, Then dragg'd her by the Hair along the Ground, And fast, behind her Back, her Arms he bound. The Princess willingly her Throat reclin'd, And view'd the Steel with a contented Mind. But soon her Tongue the girding Pincers strain With Anguish, soon she feels the piercing Pain: Oh Father! Father! She would fain have spoke, But the sharp Torture her Intention broke: In vain she tries! for now the Blade had cut Her Tongue sheer off, and left the panting Root. The mangled Part still quiver'd on the Ground, And murmur'd out a faint imperfect Sound: As some dissever'd Serpent's nimble Train, That springs, and twists, and wriggles with the Pain, So stirr'd the Tongue, with trembling Motion, fast, And dying, towards it's Mistress turn'd at last.— Croxall alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. VI. Young Itys fondling to his Procne the Wife of Tereus murder'd her own Son Itys, dressed his Limbs, and served them up to her Husband, in revenge for his Usage of her Sister Philomela. Mother came:— And as her cruel Eyes his Features trace, She cries, how like thy Father's is that Face!— In Silence, then, she forms the dreadful Scene, Her Bosom boiling with revengeful Spleen. But as the Boy to her Embraces sprung, And round her Neck in tender Transport hung, Mixing kind Kisses with his childish Charms, He moves her Soul, and all her Rage disarms: Then tender Thoughts in spite of Passion rise, And melting Tears disarm her threat'ning Eyes. But when she found the Mother's easy Heart, Too fondly swerving from th' intended Part, She, turning from the Boy, her Sister views, And in her Breast the dire Resolve renews. Then, like some Tigress, that by Ganges' Floods, A trembling Fawn drags thro' the gloomy Woods, Itys she hurries to an inward Room, Far off retir'd within the spacious Dome: The Boy, with rueful Cries, but all too late, Holds out his Hands, and deprecates his Fate: To clasp his Mother's Neck he fondly aims, And strives to melt her with endearing Names. But Procne, on the horrid Mischief bent, Home to his Heart a piercing Poiniard sent, Nor did she, while the murd'ring Blade she drove, Start once aside, or once her Eyes remove. This might suffice: but Philomela too Across his Throat a shining Cutlass drew. Then both, with Knives, dissect each quiv'ring Part, And carve the butcher'd Limbs with cruel Art: Which, whelm'd in boiling Cauldrons o'er the Fire, Or turn'd on Spits, in steamy Smoke aspire. The slipp'ry Pavement swims with crimson Gore.— Croxal. Sewel alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. VI. I saw where Marius' hapless Quintus Luctatius Catulus hearing C. Marius had resolved to put him to Death, killed himself: in Revenge of this, his Brother Catulus obtained of Sylla, that the Brother of C. Marius might be delivered into his Hands; and sacrificed him at Quintus's Tomb, in the barbarous Manner here described. Brother stood, With Limbs all torn, and cover'd o'er with Blood: A Thousand gaping Wounds increas'd his Pain, While weary Life a Passage sought in vain. That Mercy still his ruthless Foes deny, And, whom they mean to kill, forbid to die. This from the Wrist the suppliant Hands divides, That hews his Arms from off his naked Sides: One crops his breathing Nostrils, one his Ears, While from the Roots his Tongue another tares: Panting awhile upon the Earth it lies, And with mute Motion trembles e'er it dies. Last, from the sacred Caverns where they lay, The bleeding Orbs of Sight are rent away.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. II. Cuckold. Venus' Amour with Mars, the Sun (we're told) First saw: for all things he does first behold. Griev'd at the Sight, and swift, on Mischief bent, To Venus' Husband, Juno's Son, he sent: The Goddess and her God Gallant betray'd, And told the Cuckold where their Pranks were play'd. Poor Vulcan soon desir'd to hear no more: He dropp'd his Hammer, and he shook all o'er. But straight recov'ring, with malicious Pains, A Net he forms of Brass, and brazen Chains, So exquisitely fine, the sharpest Sight Could not discern them in the fairest Light: The Spider's Web, spread out to take her Prey, Is not so thin, so finely drawn as they. The Work, obedient to the Touch, he spread In secret Foldings o'er the conscious Bed: And when th' adult'rous God and Goddess came, To quench, again, and satisfy their Flame: The just Machine, so artfully prepar'd, Both, in the very Act of Love, ensnar'd. Vulcan the Iv'ry folding Doors displays, And calls the Gods to witness his Disgrace. Together link'd th' entangled Lovers lay, Expos'd, and naked, in the Face of Day: The Gods with Envy view'd, and could not blame, But for the Pleasure wish'd to bear the Shame. All laugh'd aloud: and, at each heav'nly Feast, The wanton Tale became a standing Jest.— Philips alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. IV. Before her Husband, Lesbia calls me Names, And at the Lewdness of the Town exclaims: This tickles the poor Cuckold to the Life, And he thanks Heav'n for such a virtuous Wife. Contented Fool!—Your Reas'ning is quite wrong: If she were Virtuous, she would hold her Tongue. Scandal and Noise do not her Virtue prove, But are the Marks of unextinguish'd Love.— Anon. Catul. Carm. 84. Cyclops. See Gyant. The Cyclops in their vast capacious Cave Work'd the tormented Iron: Brontes huge, And Steropes, and with his naked Limbs Pyracmon. In their Hands before them glow'd The unform'd Thunder: Bolts which Jove to Earth Profusely hurls from all the Welkin round: Part finish'd, part imperfect yet remain'd. Three Forks of darted Hail, of watry Cloud Three more they added: Three of glaring Fire: As many of the winged southern Wind. Then dreadful Flashes, and the roaring Noise, And Rage, and Terror, and avenging Flames. Some in a diff'rent Quarter of the Grot Labour'd the Chariot, and the rapid Wheels Of Mars, with which vast Cities he alarms, And rouses Heroes.— Trap. Æn. Lib. VIII. —They all with eager Haste Bend to the Labour: and their several Tasks Divide: Brass flows in Rivers: liquid Gold, And wounding Steel, in the vast Furnace boils. A mighty Shield they form: Sev'n Orbs involv'd Orb within Orb: In breathing Bellows some Receive, and render back th' included Air: Others in Water tinge the sputt'ring Brass. The Cave with batter'd Anvils groans around: By turns, with mighty Strength, in equal Time, Their Arms advance, by turns their Hammers chime.— Idem. Ibid. Daring. But Gods we all may be: for those that dare Are Gods, and Fortune's chiefest Favours share. The ruling Pow'rs a lazy Prayer detest, The bold Adventurer succeeds the best.— Croxall. Ovid. Met. Lib. VIII. Fortune is ever to the Brave a Friend.— Terent. Phor. Who bravely dare ev'n Jove himself will aid.— Ovid. Met. Lib. X. Fortune and Venus both assist the Brave.— Tibul. Lib. I. 2. Darkness. See Storm at Sea. —For neither did the Stars Appear, nor Light in all th' Expanse of Heav'n: But Clouds o'ercast the Sky: and Dead of Night Confin'd the Moon in Darkness.— Trap. Æn. Lib. III. But no red Clouds, with golden Borders gay, Promise the Skies the bright Return of Day; No faint Reflections of the distant Light, Streak with long Gleams the scatt'ring Shades of Night: From the damp Earth impervious Vapours rise, Encrease the Darkness, and involve the Skies.— Pope. Statius Lib. I. Death. See Death to be remember'd. Against the Fear of Death. Long Night will over all it's Darkness spread, And all must range the Regions of the Dead. By Rage urg'd on, the Soldier falls in War, The Sea destroys the greedy Mariner: The old and young in Heaps together lie, And from the Stroke of Death there's none can fly— Hor. Lib. I. Ode 28. Or Rich, or Poor, by whom begot, Or King or Beggar, matters not: Nor Birth, nor Wealth, nor ought can save Man from the unrelenting Grave. Our Lots are in the Urn of Fate, And out they come, or soon, or late: Then pass we to that silent Shore, From whence there's no returning more.— Hor. Lib. II. Ode 3. Death spurns at Grandeur, and brings down As well the Monarch as the Clown: His inevitable Blow Equals both the High and Low.— Boeth. 2. 7. Tho' Thou hadst all the Spice and Gold Arabia or the Indies hold, Tho' with thy Vessels Thou explore The Tyrrhene and the Pontic Shore, On Thee when Fate with Iron Claws Shall seize, Thou must obey it's Laws: No Wealth Thy Mind from Fear can save, Or keep thy Body from the Grave.— Hor. Lib. III. Ode 24. Hither all tend, hence all things rise, here fall: Rugged the Road, but must be pass'd by all. All must the triple headed Dog implore, In Charon's Boat all must be ferry'd o'er. Bright Steel and Brass in vain attempt to save: Death drags the Wearer trembling to the Grave. Achilles' Force, nor Nerea's charmful Bloom, Nor Crœsus' Wealth could save them from the Tomb.— Prop. Lib. III. El. 16. With equal Force pale Death, or soon, or late, Knocks at the Cottage and the Palace Gate. Life's Span forbids Us to extend our Cares, Or stretch our flatt'ring Hopes beyond our Years: Night urges on, and You must quickly go To fabled Ghosts, and Pluto's Courts below.— Creech alter'd. Hor. Lib. I. Ode 4. Ah! swiftly, swiftly roll the Years away! Nor can thy Piety, my Friend, delay Wrinkles, and intruding Age, And Death's unconquerable Rage. Tho', daily, Thou with Hecatombs invoke That dreadful Monarch, deaf to all thy cries, Inexorable, He will give the Stroke, Even whilst thy Prayers, yet unfinish'd, rise: That Stroke! which heretofore has laid The Great, the Strong, the Beauteous in the Dust: Which all the Dead have felt, and all the Living must; Nor Prince nor Beggar can it's Force evade.— Hor. Lib. II. Ode 14. Death swift pursues the Man that flies, Nor spares the coward Youth, nor heeds his Cries: Stab'd thro' the Back he falls, a trembling Sacrifice.— Hor. Lib. III. Ode 2. Dying's a Debt that we and our's must pay.— Hor. Art. Poet. Death only this mysterious Truth unfolds, The mighty Soul, how small a Body holds.— Dryden. Juv. Sat. X. —Death just before our Eyes, Spoils all our Boasts, and learns Us to be wise.— Sen. Her. Fur. The Sun that sets, again will rise, And give the Day, and gild the Skies: But when we lose our little Light, We sleep in everlasting Night.— Catullus. Epig. 5. Whate'er thy Eyes behold is dead, or dying: The Nights, the Days, pass on, and are no more: The Stars of Heav'n decay: nor ought avail Earth's firm Foundations: they must perish too, And all it's mighty Fabrick be dissolv'd. And can we then lament that Man must die, And perish all his mortal fleeting Race? War cuts off Part, and Part the Seas o'erwhelm: These luckless Love swift to Destruction brings: These Rage; and These unsatisfy'd Desire: Omitting all Distemper's dreadful Train, Some Winter's penetrating Rigour kills, Others the baneful Dog-Star's sultry Ray, And Others sickly Autumn's chilling Showers. What had Beginning must expect an End. All, All must die, All to the Grave must go:— As Æacus shakes the Urn, We hence, by Lot, Are call'd, to Death's immensurable Shades.— Statius. Lib. II. Syl. 1. Ye Pow'rs! who under Earth your Realms extend, To whom all Mortals must one Day descend: All our Possessions are but Loans from You, And soon, or late, you must be paid your Due: Hither we haste to Humankind's last Seat, Your endless Empire, and our sure Retreat.— Congreve. Ovid. Met. L.X. How wretched is it not to know to die!— Sen. Agam. Of Life whoever pleases can deprive Us, But none can rob Us of the Means of Dying: To Death a thousand Ways are always open.— Idem. Theb. Death be Mindful of. See Death. Amidst a Life of Hopes and anxious Cares, Of varying Passions, and disturbing Fears, Think every Day, soon as the Day is past, That Thou hast liv'd, of thy short Life, the last: The next Day's joyful Light thine Eyes shall see, When unexpected, will more welcome be.— Dart alter'd. Hor. Lib. I. Epist. 4. No Night succeeds the Day, no Morning's Light Rises to chace the sullen Shades of Night, Wherein there is not heard the dismal Groans Of dying Men, mix'd with the woful Moans Of living Friends; and also with the Cries, And Dirges, fitting fun'ral Obsequies.— Creech. Lucret. Lib. II. From Day to Day with equal Pace, Our sliding Moments steal away: Nor is the changing Moon's Increase Ought but her Progress to decay. Yet You amus'd with airy Dreams, Forgetful that the Grave is near, Are busy'd with your endless Schemes, And building stately Houses here.— Anon. Hor. Lib. II. Od. 18. Prepare the Bed, prepare the Wine, Perfumes diffuse, and Roses twine: But yet remember Death must be, So Jove himself commandeth Thee.— Martial. Death (Against the Fear of it.) See Death. What has this Bugbear Death to frighten Man, If Souls can die as well as Bodies can? For as before our Birth we felt no Pain, When Punic Arms infested Land and Main: So when our mortal Frame shall be disjoyn'd, The lifeless Lump uncoupled from the Mind, From Sense of Grief and Pain we shall be free: We shall not feel, because we shall not be. Tho' Earth in Seas, and Seas in Heav'n were lost, We should not move, we only should be toss'd. Nay, ev'n suppose when we have suffer'd Fate, The Soul could feel in her divided State, What's that to Us? for We are only We, While Souls and Bodies in one Frame agree.— Dryden. But to be snatch'd from all thy Household Joys, From thy chaste Wife, and thy dear prattling Boys, Whose little Arms about thy Legs are cast, And climbing for a Kiss, prevent their Mother's Haste, Inspiring secret Pleasure through thy Breast: All these shall be no more:—thy Friends oppress'd Thy Care and Courage now no more shall free:— Ah! Wretch! thou cry'st; Ah! miserable me! One woeful Day sweeps Children, Friends, and Wife, And all the brittle Blessings of my Life!— Add one Thing more, and All thou say'st is true: Thy Want and Wish of them is vanish'd too: For Thou shalt sleep, and never wake again, And quitting Life, shall quit thy living Pain. The worst that can befall Thee, measur'd right, Is a sound Slumber, and a long Good-Night.— Id. Lucret. Lib. III. When careful Thoughts of Death disturb thy Head, Consider, Ancus, great and good, is dead: Ancus, thy better far, was born to die: And Thou! dost Thou bewail Mortality? How many Monarchs with their mighty State, Who rul'd the World, were over-rul'd by Fate? That haughty Xerxes, who laid a Bridge over the Hellespont. King, who lorded o'er the Main, And whose stupendous Bridge did the wild Waves restrain: In vain they foam'd, in vain they threaten'd Wreck, While his proud Legions march'd upon their Back: Him Death, a greater Monarch, overcame, Nor spar'd his Guards the more for their immortal Name, The Roman Chief, the Carthaginian Dread, Scipio the Thunderbolt of War is dead, And like a common Slave by Fate in Triumph led. The Founders of invented Arts are lost; And Wits who made Eternity their Boast: Where now is Homer, who possess'd the Throne? Th' immortal Work remains, the mortal Author's gone. Democritus perceiving Age invade, His Body weaken'd, and his Mind decay'd, Obey'd the Summons with a chearful Face; Made haste to welcome Death, and met him half the Race. That Stroke, ev'n Epicurus could not bar, Tho' he in Wit surpass'd Mankind, as far As does the mid-day Sun the mid-night Star. Then Thou, dost Thou disdain to yield thy Breath, Whose very Life is little more than Death? More than one half by lazy Sleep possess'd, And when awake, thy Soul but nods at best, Day-Dreams and sickly Thoughts revolving in thy Breast. Eternal Troubles haunt thy anxious Mind, Whose Cause and Cure thou never hop'st to find: But still uncertain, with thyself at Strife, Thou wander'st in the Labyrinth of Life.— Id. Lucret. Lib. III. Nor, by the longest Life we can attain, One Moment from the Length of Death we gain: For all behind belongs to his eternal Reign. When once the Fates have cut the mortal Thread, The Man as much to all Intents is dead, Who dies to Day, and will as long be so, As He who dy'd a thousand Years ago.— Id. Ibid. Yet thus the Fools, who would be thought the Wits, Disturb their Mirth with melancholy Fits, When Healths go round, and kindly Brimmers flow, Till the fresh Garlands on their Foreheads glow, They whine, and cry, let us make haste to live! Short are the Joys that human Life can give! Eternal Preachers, that corrupt the Draught, And pall the God, that never thinks with Thought: Idiots with all that Thought, to whom the worst Of Death, is Want of Drink, and endless Thirst. Or any fond Desire as vain as these. For ev'n in Sleep, the Body wrapt in Ease Supinely lyes as in the peaceful Grave, And wanting nothing, nothing can it crave. Were that sound Sleep eternal, it were Death: Yet the first Atoms then, the Seeds of Breath Are moving near to Sense: we do but shake And rouse that Sense, and straight we are awake. Then Death, to Us, and Death's Anxiety, Is less than Nothing, if a Less could be; For then our Atoms, which in order lay, Are scatter'd from their Heap, and puff'd away; And never can return into their Place, When once the Pause of Life has left an empty Space.— Id. Lucret. Lib. III. Death's always past or coming on; in this There never any thing of present is: And the Delays of Death more painful are, Than Death itself, or Dying is, by far.— Ovid. Epist. You, whom the Terrors of cold Death affright: Why do you tremble at an empty Name, A Dream of Darkness, and a fancy'd Flame? Vain Themes of Wit! which but in Poems pass, And Fables of a World that never was! Nought feels the Body when the Soul expires, By Time corrupted, or consum'd by Fires: Nor dies the Spirit, but new Life repeats In other Forms, and only changes Seats.— Id. Ovid. Met. XV. Degeneracy. Time sensibly all Things impairs: Our Fathers have been worse than theirs, And we than ours:—next Age will see A Race more profligate than we.— Roscommon. Hor. Lib. III. Od. 6. The Fates decree, that all Things here below Rush into Worse, and ever downward go: Not otherwise, than when against the Course Of some fierce Stream, one strives with all his Force Thro' the strong Tide to urge the Vessel on; If once he slacks his Arm, he's instant gone, And headlong hurry'd with the Torrent down.— Dryd. Virg. Georg. I. Not so, at first great Romulus prescrib'd; Severe the Laws when Cato was our Guide: With better Principles our Fathers liv'd, And juster Maxims were of old receiv'd.— Anon. Hor. Lib. II. Od. 15. Delay. See Time to be used. Delay gives Strength: the tender bladed Grain, Shot up to Stalk, can stand the Wind and Rain. The Tree, whose Branches now are grown too big For Hands to bend, was set a tender Twig: When planted, to the slightest Touch 'twou'd yield, But now has got Possession of the Field. Resist at first: for Help in vain we pray, When Ills have gain'd full Strength by long Delay. Be speedy: for who's not to Day inclin'd, To morrow we shall more unwilling find.— Tate alter'd. Ov. Rem. I. Who till to Morrow would his Work delay: His lazy Morrow will be like to Day. But is one Day of Ease too much to borrow? Yes, sure; for Yesterday was once to Morrow. That Yesterday is gone, and nothing gain'd: And all thy fruitless Days will thus be drain'd: For Thou hast more to Morrows still to ask, And wilt be ever to begin thy Task: Who, like the hindmost Chariot Wheels, art curst Still to be near, but ne'er to reach the first.— Dryden. Pers. Sat. V. Stop the Disease in Time: for, when within The Dropsy rages, and extends the Skin, In vain for Hellebore the Patient cries, And fees the Doctor, but too late is wise. What then avail his offer'd Bags of Wealth? Not all the Colledge can restore his Health.— Id. alter'd. Pers. Sat. III. He's got half way that has his Work begun: Then dare be wise, and venture boldly on: Begin to live: this Moment's in thy Pow'r, Employ it then, nor wait a fitter Hour, Like some dull Clown, who at a River's Side Expecting stands, in Hopes the running Tide Will all e'er long be past:—Fool! not to know, It still has flow'd the same, and will for ever flow.— Hughes alter'd. Hor. Lib. I. Epist. 2. Deluge. See Flood. The Skies from Pole to Pole with Peals resound, And Show'rs enlarg'd, come pouring on the Ground. Th' expanded Waters gather on the Plain: And float the Fields, and overtop the Grain: Then rushing onwards, with a sweepy Sway, Bear Flocks, and Folds, and lab'ring Hinds away. Nor safe their Dwellings were, for, sapp'd by Floods, Their Houses fell upon their Household Gods. The solid Piles too strongly built to fall, High o'er their Heads behold a watry Wall: Now Seas and Earth were in Confusion lost, A World of Waters, and without a Coast. One climbs a Cliff: one in his Boat is born: And plows above, where late he sow'd his Corn.— Dryd. One sails where Village-Tops the Waves o'erwhelm, One Fishes takes amidst a lofty Elm. In Fields they Anchor cast, if Chance so guide, While crooked Keels oppress the Vineyard's Side. Where on the Grass, the Kids but lately fed, The monstrous Sea-Calf forms his oosy Bed. Beneath the deep, the Nereids, in Surprize, See Woods, and Groves, and Towns, and Temples rise. The Dolphins now amidst the Forests glide, Shake the tall Oaks, and beat the Boughs aside. The frighted Wolf now swims amongst the Sheep; Lions and Tygers mingle in the deep: His Swiftness now avails the Hart no more, Nor Force of Light'ning aids the tusked Boar.— Sewell alt. The Birds, long beating on their Wings in vain, Despair of Land, and drop into the Main. Now Hills and Vales no more Distinction know: And levell'd Nature lies oppress'd below. The most of Mortals perish in the Flood: The small Remainder dies for Want of Food.— Dryden. Ovid. Met. I. Desolation. The tott'ring Pillars nodding Roofs sustain, And, gaping wide, half ruin'd Walls remain: Fv'n in th' Italian Cities, once so great, Scarcely a living Creature now you meet: Void of Inhabitants the Houses stand, And Desolation reigns o'er all the Land: The Fields, for Years untill'd, vile Weeds o'ergrow, Nor Hands are left to exercise the Plow.— Lucan. Lib. I. Succeeding Nations by the Sword shall die, And swallow'd up in dark Oblivion lye: Almighty Latium with her Cities crown'd, Shall like an antiquated Fable sound: The Veïan and the Gabian Towers shall fall, And one promiscuous Ruin cover all: Nor, after Length of Years, a Stone betray The Place where once the very Ruins lay: High Alba's Walls, and the Lavinian Strand, (A lonely Desart, and an empty Land,) Shall scare afford, for needful Hours of Rest, A single House to their benighted Guest.— Addison. Lucan. Lib. VII. The Place he view'd, where ever dear to Fame, Troy's City stood, e'er 'twas by fire consum'd; And sought to find some Footsteps of the Walls By Phœbus rear'd: but a thick Wood of Weeds, And blasted mossy Trunks with Branches sear, Grew o'er the Palaces of Priam's Race; And with their Roots, now mould'ring into Dust, Possess'd the sacred Temples of the Gods.— Lucan. Lib. IX. With prickly Thorns, and Brambles over-run, All rude, all waste and desperate is laid, And ev'n the ruin'd Ruins are decay'd.— Rowe. Stand off, stand off, the Guide, a Phrygian, cries, Nor trample o'er where mighty Hector lies: Stones, here and there, lay scatter'd on the Ground, But no Appearance of a Tomb was found.— Ibid. Despair. —Let us die, and rush Into the thickest Arms: to vanquish'd Men The only Safety is to hope for none. —Thence, like Wolves Prowling in gloomy Shade, which Hunger blind Urges along, while their forsaken Whelps Expect them with dry Jaws: thro' Darts, thro' Foes We march to certain Death.— Trap. Virg. Æn. II. When with sad Eyes the venerable Priam. Sire, Beheld his Ilion sunk in hostile Fire: His Palace storm'd, the lofty Gates laid low, His rich Pavilions crowded with the Foe: In Arms, long since disus'd, the hoary Sage Loads each stiff languid Limb that shook with Age: Girds on an unperforming Sword, in vain! And runs on Death amidst the hostile Train.— Pitt. Ibid. So fares the Pilot, when his Ship is toss'd In troubled Seas, and all its Steerage lost: He gives her to the Winds, and in Despair, Seeks his last Refuge in the Gods and Prayer.— Addison. Ovid. Met. Lib. II. Thus when the stormy South is heard to roar, And rolls huge Billows from the Lybian Shore: When rending Sails flit with the driving Blast, And with a Crash down comes the lofty Mast: Some Coward Master leaps from off the Deck, And hasty to Despair, prevents the Wreck: And though the Bark unbroken hold her Way, Her trembling Crew all plunge into the Sea.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. I. In sullen Peace, compos'd for Death, she lyes, And waiting, longs to hear the Tempest rise: She hopes the Seamen's Vows shall all be crost, Prays for the Storm, and wishes to be lost.— Rowe. Luc. L. IX. Soon as the Queen beheld the Foe advance Against the Town, the Walls beleaguer'd round, And to the Roofs the flaming Firebrands fly: Frantic with sudden Grief Herself she calls The Crime, the Head, the Cause of all their Woe: A thousand Things she utters in Despair: Distracted, wild: and rends her purple Robes, And from a lofty Beam suspended tyes The fatal Knot of ignominious Death.— Trap. Æn. Lib. XII. Detraction. One Drop of Poyson in my Patron's Ear, One slight Suggestion of a senseless Fear, Infus'd with cunning, serves to ruin me. Disgrac'd, and banish'd from the Family, In vain forgotten Services I boast: My long Dependance in an Hour is lost.— Dryden. Juv. Sat. III. Let him cry Blackmoor-Devil whose Skin is white; And Bandy-Legs, who treads himself upright: Let him reprove that's innocent:—in vain The Gracchi of Sedition must complain.— Tate. Juv. Sat. II. I shunn'd with Caution the officious Tale: Saw what was bare, but ne'er withdrew a Veil. I never forg'd, to urge another's Fate, False Facts, nor did I those I knew relate.— Anon. Auson. Epiced. The Man who vilifies an absent Friend, Or hears him scandaliz'd, and don't defend: Who, much desiring to be thought a Wit, Will have his Jest, regardless whom it hit: Who what he never saw proclaims for true, And vends for Secrets what he never knew: Who blabs whate'er is whisper'd in his Ear, And fond of Talk, does all he knows declare: That Man's a Wretch:—of Him besure beware.— Hor. Lib. I. Sat. IV. If I'm bely'd, shall I turn pale for this? False Honours please, and false Reports disgrace And trouble, whom?—The Vicious and the Base.— Creech. Hor. Lib. I. Epist. 16. Let Men of Others to speak Ill forbear, Or their own Follies they'll be sure to hear.— Terent. Andr. Diana. See Majesty. But mild the Beauties of Diana were, And all her Charms serene, and sweetly fair: Her Brother's Looks adorn her radiant Face, Her Cheeks and sparkling Eyes express his Grace: The same she were, did not her Sex alone, A Diff'rence cause, and make the Virgin known. Her Arms are naked to th' admiring Eye, And in the Wind her careless Tresses fly: Her furnish'd Quiver on her Shoulder hung, And her neglected Bow was now unstrung. Her Cretan Vest, short gather'd from the Ground, A double Girdle regularly bound. There floating Delos the rich Robes display, And round the wand'ring Isle is wrought a golden Sea.— Hughes alter'd. Claud. Rapt. Pros. 2. Difficulty. Who soon is won, will soon her Lovers lose: But who'd retain them long, must long refuse: Oft at the Door make them for Entrance wait, And much complain, and threaten, and intreat. Bitters, when cloy'd with Sweets, our Taste restore; Ships, by fair Winds, are sometimes drove ashore. Hence springs the Coldness of a marry'd Life, The Husband, when he pleases, has his Wife. Bar but the Gate, and let the Porter cry, Here's no Admittance, Sir: I must deny. Such Opposition will increase Desire, And kindle in thy Breast a fiercer Fire.— Congreve alter'd. Ovid. Art. Lib. III. We disesteem what's easy to obtain, But what's forbidden are e'en mad to gain: Had Danaë not been kept in brazen Tow'rs, Jove had not thought her worth his golden Show'rs.— Dryd. alt. Ovid. Amor. Lib. II. Discontent. See Care. My Lord, how comes it, no One lives content, With what himself has chose, or Fortune sent: But madly doting on his Neighbour's Lot, Contemns th' Advantages his own has got? O happy Merchant! the old Soldier cries, Broke with Fatigue and martial Exercise. The Merchant, by the Billows toss'd on high, Cries, happy is the Soldier's Fate: for why, A Battle soon brings Death, or joyful Victory. The hurrying Lawyer, calls the Farmer blest, When early Clients interrupt his Rest. The Farmer, whom some Business of the Law, Does from the Country to the City draw, Extols the Pleasures of the gaudy Town, And thinks a City Life the only one.— Hor. Lib. I. Sat. 1. Your Country Life I judge an Happiness, And mine in Town, you fancy, is no less: Fond of each other's Lot, we hate our own, And wrongly blame the Country, or the Town: Fools both! for in the Place no Fault does lie, But in the Mind,—from which there's none can fly.— Hor. Lib. I. Ep. 14. Discord. See War Civil. The Trumpets sound! when strait fell Discord rais'd Her Stygian Head, and shook her matted Locks: With clotted Blood her Face was cover'd o'er, And gummy Horrors from her Eyes distill'd: Two Rows of canker'd Teeth deform'd her Mouth, And from her Tongue a Stream of Poison flow'd, While hissing Serpents play'd around her Cheeks: Her livid Skin with Rags was scarce conceal'd, And in her trembling Hand a Torch she shook. Ascending thus from the Tartarean Gloom, She reach'd the Top of lofty Apennine: Whence ev'ry Sea and Land she might behold, And Armies moving over all the Globe: Then from her furious Bosom thus she spoke. Now rush, ye Nations, rush to mutual Arms: And let Dissention's Torch for ever burn! Let Flight no longer now the Coward save, Nor Age, nor Sex, nor Childhood Pity move: Let the Earth tremble, and her haughtiest Tow'rs Shake, in convulsive Ruins, to the Ground.— Petron. Arb. As stubborn Steers by brawny Plowmen broke, And joyn'd reluctant to the galling Yoke, Alike disdain with servile Necks to bear Th' unwonted Weight, or drag the crooked Share, But rend the Reins, and bound a diff'rent Way, And all the Furrows in Confusion lay: Such was the Discord of the royal Pair, Whom Fury drove precipitate to War.— Pope. Stat. Theb. Lib. I. Dissimulation. To Mercury Autolycus she brought, Who turn'd to Thefts and Shifts his subtle Thought: Possess'd he was of all his Father's Slight, At Will made White look Black, and Black look White.— Croxall. Ovid. Met. Lib. XI. —When all the Furies in her Breast She had conceiv'd, o'ercome with wild Despair, And resolute to die: the Time, and Means She with herself contrives: and Thus accosts Her mourning Sister: (her Design conceals And smooths her Visage with dissembled Hope.) Rejoice with me, my Sister: I have found A sure Expedient, which will either bring My Lover back, or free me from my Love.— Trap. Æn. Lib. IV. Mean while the Trojan Shepherds, shouting, dragg'd A Youth, with pinion'd Arms, before the King: Who with Design had fall'n into their Hands, Unknown: to manage the concerted Plot, And open to the Greeks the Gates of Troy: Bold to attempt, and on both Sides prepar'd, Either to meet Success, or certain Death.— Id. Æn. Lib. II. False Tears he shed, and from a joyful Breast Fetch'd Sighs and Groans, believing Tears would best The inward Pleasure of his Heart conceal, Which otherwise he fear'd he should reveal.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. IX. Does the fair Bride Love's Contest really dread That she takes on so, when she's put to Bed? Or, mind her Parents the dissembled Tear? She does not weep in earnest, I dare swear.— Anon. Catul. 67. Dissolution of all Things. See Death. So shall one Hour, at last, this Globe controul, Break up the vast Machine, dissolve the Whole, And Time no more thro' measur'd Ages roll. Then Chaos hoar shall seize his former Right, And reign with Anarchy and endless Night: The starry Lamps shall combat in the Sky, And lost, and blended in each other, die: Quench'd in the Deep the heavenly Fires shall fall, And Ocean, cast abroad, o'er spread the Ball. The Moon no more her well known Course shall run, But rise from Western Waves, and meet the Sun: Ungovern'd, shall she quit her ancient Way, Herself ambitious to supply the Day: Confusion wild shall all around be hurl'd, And Discord and Disorder tear the World.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. I. Jove too remember'd that a Time shall come, For such is Fate's irrevocable Doom, When Sea, and Earth, and Sky, shall glow with Fire, And all this vast Machine in Flames expire.— Ovid. Met. Lib. I. Disswasion. See Intreaty. My Son, says he, some other Proof require, Rash was my Promise, rash is thy Desire. I'd fain deny this Wish, which Thou hast made, Or what I can't deny, wou'd fain disswade. Too vast and hazardous the Task appears, Not suited to thy Strength, nor to thy Years. Thy Lot is mortal, but thy Wishes fly Beyond the Province of Mortality. Oh! don't, my Son, this fatal Gift require, But, while Thou canst, recall thy rash Desire. Chuse what Thou wilt from Seas, or Earth, or Skies, For open to thy Wish all Nature lies: Only decline this one unequal Task, A Mischief not an Honour 'tis you ask. You ask a real Mischief, Phaëton: Nay, hang not thus about my Neck, my Son: I grant your Wish, and Styx has heard my Voice: Chuse what you will:—but make a wiser Choice.— Addison. Ovid. Met. Lib. II. Me dost Thou fly?—By these distilling Tears, By thy Right Hand, (since Nought else I've reserv'd To wretched me,) by our connubial Rites, And Hymenéal Loves but yet begun: If ever I have ought of Thee deserv'd, Or any Thing of mine was e'er to Thee Delightful: pity my declining State: And, Oh! if yet there's any room for Pray'r, Be yet intreated,—yet thy Purpose change.— Trap. Æn. Lib. IV. O Gallant Youth! the more thy Valour boils Exuberant, the more it me concerns With Prudence to advise, and fearing weigh All Hazards. Thee thy Father Daunus' Realms, And many Cities vanquish'd by thy Arms, Attend, to own thy Sway.— Think on the various Chance of doubtful War: Pity thy aged Father: whom from Thee His distant City Ardea now divides, Sad and disconsolate.— Id. Æn. Lib. XII. The weeping Queen, ev'n dying with her Fears, Hung on the ardent Hero. By these Tears, I beg Thee, Turnus, grant this one Request: If ought of Rev'rence ever touch'd thy Soul, For poor Amata. Thou the only Hope Art left, the Solace of my wretched Age: On Thee Latinus' Fame, and Realm, on Thee The Royal House with all it's Stress reclines. Forbear: nor urge the Trojans to the Field: Whatever Fortune waits Thee in the War, Me too, my Turnus, waits.— The fair Lavinia seconds with her Tears Her Mother's Suit; and bathes her glowing Cheeks.— Id. Ibid. Dogs. See Flight. Hunting. Nor be thy Care of Dogs the last: but feed With fatt'ning Whey the brave Molossian Race, And the fleet Spartân: Never (while they watch) The nightly Thief, or Inroads of the Wolf, Or ravaging Iberian, shalt thou fear. Oft too with Hounds the timerous wild Ass Thou shalt pursue: With Hounds the Hare, and Hind: Oft from his wallowing Beds in Thickets rouse The sylvan Boar, and chase him in full Cry: And o'er the lofty Mountains, with a Shout, The stately Stag into thy Toils impel.— Trap. Georg. Lib. III. Doubt. The Mother and the Sister long contest: Two doubtful Titles, struggling in her Breast. With Horror of the Fact, now pale she stood; Now Rage boil'd high, and flush'd her Eyes with Blood: Now dreadful Threats sat glaring in her Face, And milder Mercy now again took Place: Resolv'd, she doubts again: the Tears she dry'd With burning Rage, are by new Tears supply'd. And, as a Ship, which Winds and Waves assail, Now with the Current drives, now with the Gale, Both opposite, and neither long prevail: It feels a double Force, by Turns obeys Th' imperious Tempest, and the impetuous Seas: So fares Althea's Mind: she first relents With Pity, of that Pity then repents.— Dryden alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. VIII. 'Twas now the Noon of Night, when Slumbers close Our Eyes, and sooth our Cares with soft Repose. But no Repose could wretched Myrrha find, Her Body rolling, as she roll'd her Mind: Mad with Desire, she ruminates her Sin, And Wishes all her Wishes o'er again: Now she despairs: and now resolves to try: Wou'd not, and wou'd again, she knows not why: Stops, and returns: makes, and retracts the Vow: Fain wou'd begin, but understands not how. As when a Pine is hew'd upon the Plains, And the last mortal Stroke alone remains, Tottering it stands aloft, and threatning all, This Way, and that Way nods, uncertain where to fall: So Myrrha's Mind, impell'd on either Side, Takes every Bent, but cannot long abide: Irresolute on which she should rely, At last, unfix'd in all, is only fix'd to die.— Dryd. alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. X. —His wavering Mind divides A Thousand Ways: now This, now That resolves, And turns on every Side it's shifting Thoughts. As when in brazen Vats the trembling Light Of Water, from the Sun's reflected Beams, Or from the Image of the radiant Moon, Flits all around, and now is whirl'd aloft To the high Roof, and dances in the Air.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. VIII. Should Joy, or Grief, she said, possess my Breast, To see my Country by a War opprest? I'm in Suspence! For, tho' 'tis Grief to know I love a Man who is declar'd my Foe; Yet, in my own Despite, I must approve That lucky War, which brought the Man I love.— Croxall. Ovid. Met. Lib. VIII. Dreams. See Sleep. Folded in Sleep whilst all the Members lie, And the whole Body is to Rest compos'd, Then, even then, we fancy we're awake, And move, and act, and view the glorious Sun, And chearful Day;—tho' pitchy Night it be: Then too, tho' all the while in Bed confin'd, Imaginary Climes we journey thro': O'er various Seas, Rivers, and Mountains steep, And flow'ry Fields we range: and Voices hear, And Answers apt return; tho' all around, Reigns solemn Silence, and a Hush profound.— Lucret. Lib. IV. Whatever Studies please, whatever Things The Mind pursues, or dwells on with Delight, The same, in Dreams, engage our chief Concern: The Lawyers plead, and argue what is Law: The Soldiers fight, and thro' the Battle rage: The Sailors Work, and strive against the Winds: Me, an Enquiry into Nature's Laws, And writing down my Thoughts continually employs.— Whatever Actions often are perform'd, On every Creature else, as well as Man, Have this Effect: Stout Horses you shall see, (Whilst at their Length, and fast asleep they lie,) Lather'd with Sweat, snorting, and panting quick: As if, the Barrier down, with all their Strength, They stretch'd, and were contending for the Palm. Hounds too are often hunting in their Sleep, And fling about their Limbs, and open oft, And often snuff the Air, as on full Scent, Pursuing close the Footsteps of their Prey.— Ibid. But Somnus the God of Sleep. He, of Dreams the Parent, does excite Morpheus that artful masquerading Sprite: Morpheus, of all his num'rous Sons, express'd The Shape of Man, and imitated best: The Walk, the Words, the Gesture could supply, The Habit mimic, and the Mein belie: Plays well, but all his Action is confin'd, Extending not beyond our human Kind. Another Birds, and Beasts, and Dragons apes, And dreadful Images, and Monster shapes: This Demon, Icelos, in Heav'n's high Hall, The Gods have nam'd: but Men Phobetor call. A third is Phantasus, whose Actions roll On meaner Thoughts, and Things devoid of Soul: Earth, Fruits, and Flow'rs, he represents in Dreams, And solid Rocks unmov'd, and running Streams.— Dryd. Ovid. Met. Lib. XI. Two Gates of Sleep there are: the one of Horn, Thro' which with Ease the real Fantoms pass: With polish'd Elephant the other shines, Thro' which the Manes send false Dreams to Light.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. VI. So when a Dream our sleeping Sight betrays, And to our View some hidden Gold conveys, Our busy Hands th' inviting Treasure seize, And short-liv'd Joys our working Fancy please: But straight, we sweat with Dread, lest any Spy, Should find the Secret, and our Theft descry. Nay, even when the charming Dream is o'er, When we're awake, and as we were before, Sighing, we wish the fancy'd Loss regain'd, And with the Image still are entertain'd.— Petronius. When, in our Dreams, the Forms of Things arise, In mimic Order plac'd before our Eyes, Nor Heav'n, nor Hell, the airy Vision sends, But ev'ry Breast it's own Delusion lends. For when soft Sleep the Body lays at Ease, And from the heavy Mass our Fancy frees, Whate'er it is in which we take Delight, And think of most by Day, we dream at Night.— Thus he who shakes proud States, and Cities burns, Sees Show'rs of Darts, forc'd Lines, disorder'd Wings, Fields drown'd in Blood, and Obsequies of Kings: The Lawyer dreams of Terms, and double Fees, And trembles when he long Vacations sees: The Miser hides his Wealth, new Treasure finds: In ecchoing Woods his Horn the Huntsman winds: The Sailor's Dream a shipwreck'd Chance describes: The Whore writes Billet doux: Th' Adultress bribes: The op'ning Dog the tim'rous Hare pursues: And Misery in Sleep it's Pain renews.— Anon. alter'd. Ibid. Still Slumbers Erisichthon's Senses drown, And sooth his Fancy with their softest Down. He dreams of Viands delicate to eat, And revels on imaginary Meat. Chaws with his working Mouth, but chaws in vain, And tires his grinding Teeth with fruitless Pain: Deludes his Throat with visionary Fare, Feasts on the Wind, and Banquets on the Air.— Vernon. Ovid. Met. Lib. VIII. Dress, and Good Breeding. Be not too finical, but yet be clean, And wear well fashion'd Cloths, like other Men. Nor sputt'ring speak, nor let your Teeth be foul, Nor in wide Shoes your Feet too loosely roul. Of a black Muzzle, and black Beard beware, And let a skilfull Barber cut your Hair. Your Nails be pick'd from Filth, and even par'd; Nor let your nasty Nostrils bud with Beard: Cure your unsavoury Breath; gargle your Throat; And free your Arm-Pits from the Ram and Goat.— Dryd. Ovid. Art. I. Beauty's the Gift of Gods, the Sex's Pride! Yet to how many is that Gift deny'd! Art helps a Face: a Face tho' heav'nly fair, May quickly fade for want of needful Care.— Congreve. Ovid. Art. Lib. III. Let not the Nymph with Pendants load her Ear, Nor in Embroidery, or Brocade, appear: Too rich a Dress may sometimes check Desire, And Cleanliness more animates Love's Fire. The Hair dispos'd, may gain or lose a Grace, And much become, or misbecome the Face. What suits your Features of your Glass enquire, For no one Rule is fix'd for Head Attire.— Id. Ibid. A Face too long should part and flat the Hair, Least, upward comb'd, the Length too much appear: So Laodamia dress'd. A Face too round Sould shew the Ears, and with a Tow'r be crown'd. On either Shoulder, one, her Locks displays, Adorn'd like Phœbus when he sings his Lays: Another, all her Tresses ties behind; So dress'd, Diana hunts the fearful Hind. Dishevell'd Locks most graceful are to some: Others the binding Fillets more become: Some plat, like spiral Shells, their braded Hair: Others the loose and waving Curl prefer.— Id. Ibid. Many there are who seem to slight all Care, And with a pleasing Negligence ensnare: Whole Mornings oft, in such a Dress are spent, And all is Art, that looks like Accident.— Id. Ibid. As Fields you find with various Flow'rs o'erspread, When Vineyards bud, and Winters Frost is fled: So various are the Colours you may try, Of which the thirsty Wool imbibes the Dye. Try ev'ry one, what best becomes you, wear: For no Complexion all alike, can bear. If fair the Skin, black may become it best; In black the lovely fair Briseïs dress'd: If brown the Nymph, let her be cloth'd in white; Andromeda so charm'd the wond'ring Sight.— Id. Ibid. Faults in your Person, or your Face, correct: And few are seen that have not some Defect. The Nymph too short, her Seat should seldom quit, Lest, when she stands, she may be thought to sit: And, when extended on her Couch she lies, Let Length of Petticoats conceal her Size. The Lean, of thick wrought Stuff her Cloths should chuse, And fuller made than what the plumper use. If pale, let her the crimson Juice apply: If swarthy, to the pearly Fucus fly. A Leg too lank, tight Garters still must wear, Nor should an ill-shap'd Foot be ever bare. Round Shoulders, bolster'd will appear the least: And lacing straight, confines too full a Breast. Whose Fingers are too fat, and Nails too coarse, Should always shun much Gesture in Discourse. And You, whose Breath is touch'd, this Caution take, Nor fasting, nor too near another, speak. Let not the Nymph with Laughter much abound, Whose Teeth are black, uneven, or unsound. You'd hardly think how much on this depends, And how a Laugh, or spoils a Face, or mends. Gape not too wide, lest you disclose your Gums, And lose the Dimple which the Cheek becomes: Nor let your Sides too strong Concussions shake, Lest you the Softness of the Sex forsake.— Id. Ov. Art. III. Neglect no Means which may promote your Ends: Now learn what way of Walking recommends. One has an artful Swing and Jut behind, Which helps her Coats to catch the swelling Wind: Swell'd with the wanton Wind they loosely flow, And ev'ry Step and graceful Motion show. Another, like an Umbrian's sturdy Spouse, Strides all the Space her Petticoat allows. Between Extreams, in this, a Mean adjust: Nor shew too nice a Gate, nor too robust.— Id. Ibid. By Art we're won: Gold, Gems, and rich Attire, Make up the Pageant you so much admire: In all that glitt'ring Figure which you see, The least, least Part of her own self is she. In vain, for her you love, amidst such Cost, You search: the Mistress in the Dress is lost.— Tate. Ovid. Rem. Am. Lib. I. Proud Cleopatra with Ambition fir'd, Had stain'd her Cheeks, and arm'd with artful Care Her fatal Eyes, new Conquests to prepare: Bright Jewels grac'd her Neck, and sparkled in her Hair. O'ercharg'd with Spoils which the Red-Sea supply'd, Scarce can she move beneath the pond'rous Pride. Of wondrous Work, a thin Sydonian Lawn O'er each soft Breast in Decency was drawn: But thro' the Veil, contriv'd its Charms to shew, Her lovely Bosom panting rose to View.— Hughes alter'd. Lucan. Lib. X. Druids. Ye Druids, too, now Arms are heard no more, Old Mysteries and barb'rous Rites restore. To You, and You of all Mankind alone, The Gods are sure reveal'd, or sure unknown: Whilst in the gloomy Coverts of the Grove, You dwell retir'd, and Religion love. If dying Mortals' Dooms you sing aright, No Ghosts descend to dwell in dreadful Night: No parting Souls to grizly Pluto go, Nor seek the dreary silent Shades below: But forth they fly, immortal in their Kind, And other Bodies, in new Worlds they find. Thus Life for ever runs its endless Race, And, like a Line, Death but divides the Space, A Stop which can but for a Moment last, A Point between the Future and the Past. Thrice happy They, beneath their northern Skies, And blest in their Mistake,— Who that worst Fear, the Fear of Death, despise: Hence they no Cares for this frail Being feel, But rush, undaunted, on the pointed Steel: Provoke approaching Fate, and bravely scorn To spare that Life, which must so soon return.— Rowe alt. Lucan. Lib. I. Dying. See Suicide. Wound. — Dido. She strives with Pain To lift her heavy Lids, and fainting sinks: The Wound infix'd sounds deep beneath her Breast. Thrice, leaning on her Arm, she feebly rais'd Her Body: thrice roll'd back upon the Bed: With swimming Eyes seeks the last Light of Heav'n, And groans to find it. Then the Wife of Jove, Pitying her tedious Pangs, and struggling Death, Sends Iris from above, to disengage Her agonizing Soul. For since she fell Neither by Fate, nor by a Death deserv'd, But dy'd unfortunate before her Time, Transported by a sudden Passion's Rage; As yet Proserpina her yellow Hair Had not shorn off, nor to the Stygian Shades Consign'd her. Iris then, with saffron Wings, Dewy, and drawing from the opposing Sun A thousand various Colours in the Sky, Alighted swift: and hov'ring o'er her Head, This Lock to Pluto sacred, by Command, I bear: and from this Body set thee free. She said, and with her Right Hand cut the Lock: At once the vital Heat is all extinct, And Life dissolving fleets into the Winds.— Trap. Æn. IV. — Camilla. She dying tugs The sticking Jav'lin: but between the Bones, In the deep Wound, fix'd stands the pointed Steel: All pale she sinks: her cold Eyes sink in Death: And from her Cheeks the rosy Colour flies. Then thus, expiring, Acca she bespeaks, Her best lov'd Friend, and Partner of her Cares: —My Sister Acca, now My Life-Blood issues thro' the aking Wound, And all Things swim in Mists before my Eyes: Haste, and to Turnus these last Mandates bear: Let him succeed to Battle, and repel The Trojans from the Town. And now,—Adieu. So saying, from her slacken'd Hand she drops The Reins: and not spontaneous flows to Earth: Cold, by Degrees, she sobs her Life away: Reclines her hanging Neck, and heavy Head; —And to the Shades below With Indignation flies her groaning Soul.— Id. Æn. XI. When to the Youth his mournful Sire appears, His dying, weak, unweildy Head he rears: With lifted Eyes, he cast a mournful Look, His pale Lips mov'd, and fain he would have spoke: But unexpress'd, th' imperfect Accent hung, Lost in his falling Jaws, and fault'ring Tongue: Yet in his speechless Visage seems exprest, What, had he Words, would be his last Request: That aged Hand to seal his closing Eye, And in his Father's fond Embrace to dye.— Rowe. Luc. Lib. III. The Wound is mortal; Art affords no Aid. So Violets, Poppies, and soft Lillies so, Bruise but the tender Stem on which they grow, Instant sink down their unsupported Heads, And bend, decaying, to their earthy Beds: So hung his dying Looks; so, oversway'd, His languid Neck was on his Shoulder laid.— Theobald alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. X. —A deadly Rest, And iron Slumbers seal his heavy Eyes, And closes them in everlasting Night.— Trap. Virg. Æn. X. Eagle. As when the tawny Eagle tow'ring high, Sticks with her griping Talons in a Snake, And snatches him aloft: He wounded writhes His tortuous Volumes, and with stiffen'd Scales Stares horrid: hisses loud, and in the Air Erects his threat'ning Head: She not the less Plies him, reluctant, with her hooky Beak; And with her sounding Pinions beats the Sky.— Trap. Æn. Lib. XI. Not with more Ease the sacred Bird of Mars, The Faulcon, from a lofty Cliff pursues A Dove sublime in Air, and gripes her seiz'd, And scoops her Entrails with his hooky Claws: Torn Plumes and Blood fall mingled from the Sky.— Id. Ibid. In the vermilion Sky Jove's tow'ring Bird A Flock of River Fowl with sounding Wings Before him drove: Then, stooping to the Waves, With his sharp Pounces snatch'd and bore aloft A stately Swan.— Id. Æn. Lib. XII. When Jove's bold Bird, on some tall Cedar's Head, Has a new Race of gen'rous Eaglets bred, While, yet unplum'd, within the Nest they lye, Wary she turns 'em to the Eastern Sky: Then, if unequal to the God of Day, Abash'd they shrink, and shun the potent Ray, She spurns them forth, and casts them quite away: But if with daring Eyes unmov'd they gaze, Withstand the Light, and bear the golden Blaze, Tender she broods them, with a Parent's Love, The future Servants of her Master Jove.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. XI. Earth. See Golden Age. Creation. Herbage at first, the Earth when young produc'd, Of ev'ry Kind; and round the Hills display'd A beauteous Verdure: then the grassy Fields All o'er with various Flow'rs enamel'd shone. Trees, next, their Branches shoot into the Air, Uprising gradual, while the Roots in Earth Extend and fix:—As Feathers first, and Hair, On Birds and Beasts, so on the new form'd Earth, At first, grew Herbs and Trees: by various Ways, Brutes, and Mankind, were afterwards produc'd.— Luc. Lib. V. Corn, of its own Accord, and cordial Wine, The Earth brought forth; and such delicious Fruits, And Food, abundant, both for Man and Beast, As now, with all our Toil, it scarce supplies.— Luc. Lib. II. The Earth, when new, produc'd no raging Cold, Nor Heats, nor Storms: these grew as she grew old: Therefore our Parent Earth deserves to bear The Name of Mother, since all rose from her. The Human Race, a certain Time, she bore, And Beasts that shake the Woods with dreadful Roar, And Birds of various Forms that wing the Air.— Creech alter'd. Luc. Lib. V. —The Earth Lowest of all, and in the Center lies: Fixt by its Place: for from it, rising higher, Upwards the other Elements retire. It hangs the lowest, and the midst of all, Whence, all its Parts by falling, stop its Fall: All to one common Center pressing down, They meet, and hinder each from moving on.— Creech. Manil. Lib. I. Education. See Example. Parents and Children. Let no indecent Speech, or Action vile, Be known within the Walls where Youth is bred: Far, far from thence keep wanton Girls away, And idle Parasites, that all the Night Chant luscious Songs.—Much Reverence and Regard To Youth is due: nor Thou his Age contemn, But let, when Evil rises in thy Mind, Thy Infant-Son restrain and keep Thee Good. Dost Thou expect a Friend? Thy Servants all Are hurried to their Tasks:—rub, rub the Floors: Make all the Pillars shine: down, from the Walls, Brush the dead Spiders and their Webs away. One scours the Plate with Figures rich emboss'd, Another what is plain: yourself, mean while, Urge on the Work with Chiding, or with Blows. Wretch! dost Thou fear a Dog's T?d in thy Hall, Should turn the Stomach of thy coming Guest; Or that thy Porch with Dirt should be defil'd; Faults which a single Servant with a Broom Can soon amend: and yet regardest not To keep thy Family from Blemish free, From Vice, or Baseness, which thy Son may see?— Juv. Sat. XIV. 'Tis much better, in my Opinion, to keep Children in order by Shame and Generosity of Inclination than by Fear.—That Man, I conceive, is very much mistaken, who imagines Government, purely by Force, to have more Authority, and a better Foundation, than when 'tis accompanied with Tenderness and Respect. This is my Logic, and I argue thus: He that's compell'd by Threats to do his Duty, will continue wary no longer than You have an Eye over him; and when he thinks he sha'n't be found out, he'll eagerly follow his own Inclinations. But he that's governed by Love, obeys most chearfully; strives to make his due Returns; and is just the same whether you are present or absent. 'Tis a Father's Part to use his Child so, that his own Choice, rather than outward Constraint, may put him upon doing well. Here lies the Difference between a Father and a Master: and he that does otherwise, let him own, that he understands not at all how to govern Children.— Eachard alter'd. Teren. Adelp. Education Rigid. Before the City, Boys, and blooming Youth, With rapid Chariots exercise their Strength, And tame their Horses in the dusty Field: Or bend their twanging Bows, and with strong Arms Launch the tough Jav'lin: with the Dart, and Shaft, Contending.— Trap. Æn. Lib. VII. We in the Rivers plunge our new-born Babes, And harden them in Frost, and icy Streams. Our Boys in hunting vex the Woods, and tire The savage Beasts: with them 'tis Children's play To rein the Steed, and bend the twanging Bow. But patient of Fatigue, and train'd to live On little, with keen Shares our lusty Youth Subdue the Soil, or batter Towns with War. In Iron ev'ry Stage of Life we pass, And goad our Oxen with inverted Spears. Nor does the Clog of tardy Age abate The Vigour of our Minds, or damp our Fire. With Helmets ev'n our hoary Hair we press, And evermore delight to bear away Fresh daily Plunder, and by Rapine live.— Idem. Æn. Lib. IX. Let the bold Boy, my Friends, be train'd to bear The Wants and rough Severities of War; By vig'rous Exercise improve his Force, And learn the manly Manage of his Horse: Then let him Charge the Parthians with his Spear, And make their rugged Troops his Presence fear. Still be his Lodging on the naked Ground, And there his Business where most Danger's found.— Hor. Lib. III. Ode 2. Effeminacy. See Sloth. You, clad in shining Purple, and in Vests With long luxuriant Sleeves, indulge your Sloth: Dances are your Delight, and broider'd Robes: And Ribbons bind your Bonnets to your Chin.— Trap. Æn. Lib. IX. Alcinous' idle Youth, whose sole Design Aim'd at soft Blandishments, and dressing fine, At Ease, indulg'd, and slept out half the Day, And lull'd their Cares with Dancing, Songs, and Play.— Creech alter'd. Hor. Lib. I. Ep. 2. What will not Others do, when Thou so thin Art clad, that thro' the Silk we see thy Skin? How stare the People such a Judge to see, But more to hear thee rail at Harlotry? —Fabulla is, you say A Whore;—I own it:—so's Carfinia: Rank Prostitutes! therefore without Remorse, Punish the Strumpets: give the Law it's Course: But when on them You've pass'd your Sentence, know, They'd blush to be so loosely drest as You. You say the Dog-Star reigns, whose sultry Fire Melts You to Death, e'en in that light Attire: Go naked then, 'twere better to be mad, (Which has a Privilege) than so lewdly clad. How would our Mountain Sires return'd from Plow, Or Battle, such a silken Judge allow?— Dryden alter'd. Juv. Sat. II. Elements. See Change. Creation. The Force of Fire ascended first on high, And void of Weight, blaz'd from the vaulted Sky: Air, next in Levity, and next in Place, Sunk lower down, and fill'd the midmost Space: The Earth, of closer and compacter State, Fell, self-incumber'd with it's native Weight, Attracting all that's gross:—and flowing round The Water last took Place, and Earth's firm Circuit bound.— Sewell alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. I. For this eternal World is said, of old, But four prolific Principles to hold: Of these, two by their native Weight descend, Water and Earth: these ever downwards tend: An equal Number, uncompell'd, aspire, Devoid of Weight; pure Air, and purer Fire. All Things are mix'd of These, which all contain, And into these are all resolv'd again.— Sewell alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. XV. Upwards the Fire on active Pinions fled, To Heav'n's high Arch it rais'd it's shining Head, There took it's Place, and circling round the Frame, For Nature's Bulwark roll'd a Wall of Flame. Then liquid Air, spread thro' the empty Space, Less light and active took the second Place: But next the Flame the lightest Parts aspire, To waste themselves, and feed the greedy Fire. The heavier Water makes an humbler Claim, And lies, the third in order, in the Frame; That Vapours, rising, may like Seed, repair What Fire destroys, and feed decaying Air. Earth to the Center by it's Weight sinks down.— Creech alter'd. Manil. Lib. I. Eloquence. As when Sedition oft in populous Towns Is rais'd, and fierce th' ignoble Vulgar rave: Now Stones, and Firebrands fly: Rage Arms supplies: If then by chance they 'spy a Sage, rever'd For Piety and Worth, All silent stand, List'ning with Ears attentive: with his Words He rules their Passion, and their Heat allays.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. I. Now from his Seat arose Laërtes' Son; Look'd down a while, and paus'd e'er he begun: Then to th' expecting Princes rais'd his Look, And not without prepar'd Attention spoke. Soft was his Tone and sober was his Face, Action his Words, and Words his Action grace.— Dryd. Ovid. Met. Lib. XIII. Learn Eloquence, You noble Youth of Rome: It will not only at the Bar o'ercome, The wond'ring People, and the Senate move, But Eloquence will gain the Maid you love.— Dryden alter'd. Ovid. Art. Aman. Lib. I. The fam'd Ulysses was nor Fair, nor Young, But eloquent, and charming was his Tongue: And yet for him contending Beauties strove, And ev'ry Sea-Nymph sought the Hero's Love. Ah! how Calypso griev'd, when from her Shores He thought to sail, and stopp'd his hasty Oars! Oft she enquir'd of ruin'd Ilium's Fate, And made him oft the wondrous Tale relate: Which with such Grace his florid Tongue could frame, The Story still was new, tho' still the same.— Dryd. alter'd. Ovid. de Art. Lib. II. Elysian-Fields. See Hell. —To the Realms of Joy At length Æneas and the Sybil. They come, and to the blissful Greens, Fortunate Groves, and Mansions of the Blest. An Æther more enlarg'd here cloaths the Fields With purple Light: and their own proper Sun And proper Stars they know. On grassy Meads Some wrestling exercise their Limbs, contend In Sport, and struggle on the yellow Sand. Others in Dances artful Measures beat And Verse recite.— —With wonder they behold Their Arms, and empty Chariots on the Plain At distance rang'd: their Spears stand fix'd in Earth: And loose o'er all the Field their Horses feed. The same Delight in Chariots, and in Arms, And shining Steeds, which living they conceiv'd, Pursues them still beneath the Earth repos'd. Others, on either Hand, he sees reclin'd, Feasting, along the Grass, and Pæans sweet Singing in Chorus, in the fragrant Grove Of Lawrel: whence, descending thro' the Wood, Eridanus abundant rolls his Waves. Here, those who for their Country Wounds endur'd In War: and Priests whose Life was chast and pure: And pious Poets, who recited Things Worthy of Phœbus: those who polish'd Life With Arts invented: or consign'd their Names To Memory, by well deserving Deeds. Their Heads are all with snow white Fillets wreath'd. In no fix'd Place the happy Souls reside: In Groves we live, and lie on mossy Beds, By christal Streams that murmur thro' the Meads.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. VI. Between thick baleful Yews, the steep dark Way To Hell's dire Realms, thro' dismal Silence lay: There Stygian Mists infect the Road; and there New Ghosts, of Bodies just entomb'd, appear. Paleness and Cold surround the loathsome Place, And new come Spirits, with a mournful Pace, The Way to Hell's chief Seat, which yet they know not, trace. A thousand Avenues, a thousand Gates, Th' insatiable Metropolis dilates: And as the Ocean's spacious Womb receives All Streams, yet room for coming Waters leaves; So, that devouring Place, all Ghosts retains, Yet never fills, or of the Crowd complains. There the pale Ghosts, unbodied, loosely roam: Some haunt the Pleas, their Tyrant's Palace some: Others, for their Amusement, imitate The past Employments of their mortal State:— The rest are tortur'd for their former Crimes.— Philips alt. Thrice roars, at once, three-headed Cerberus: Th' avenging Furies, Daughters of old Night, Implacable, and hating all Delight, Before the adamantine Entrance sit, Comb out their hissing Snakes, their tangl'd Curls unknit.— Ovid, Met. Lib. IV. Here Ghosts of Nations numberless repair: Pass the dark Way, and glide along the Gloom. One Habitation here does all receive. A Space prodigious in the midst extends: Hither, whatever Earth, or Sea, or Air, From the first forming of the fruitful World, Has bred and nourish'd, Death all-destroying, drives. All, all descend: the unproductive Plains Receive whate'er has dy'd, whate'er shall die. Ten Gates around these Regions open wide Their ample Portals: To the first resort Those doom'd, by rigid Fate, to fall in War. The next receives such as have Laws compil'd, The Rights of Nations fix'd, and with strong Walls Made Cities safe. Thro' the third Portal pass The Countrymen, Ceres' most honest Tribe, Of all the num'rous Ghosts that hither come The most Upright, untainted with Deceit. Who useful Arts invent, or find out means To polish Life, or Verses to the God Inspiring Phœbus, not unworthy, sing, The fourth fair Gate admits. Those whom the Winds And cruel Storms have wreck'd, an Entrance find Thro' what stands next, thence call'd the Shipwreck-Gate. Near this, there opens wide a Passage vast, For all the Wicked who confess their Crimes. Here Rhadamanthus, when they first arrive, The guilty Ghosts condemns to endless Woe, To be for ever dying, never dead. The female World crouds thro' the seventh Gate, Near which chast Proserpine's aspiring Groves Project an horrid Shade. Hence lies the Way Where Troops of Infants pass, and spotless Maids Whose nuptial Beds were turn'd to Funerals, And Crowds expiring e'er they saw the Light; A Gate well known for Children's feeble Cries. Distant from hence, and glitt'ring thro' the Gloom, Appear the shining Doors, whence lies the Way, Shady, and private, to th' Elysian Fields. Here dwell the Righteous: not in Hell's dark Realm, Nor where the Sun's superior Light is seen, But beyond Ocean's Bounds, where they contend Who first shall reach slow Lethe's sacred Stream, And drink Forgetfulness. The outmost Gate Bright glows with Gold: and here the Beam of Day Is just perceiv'd, like the Moon's feeble Shine. The Passage this by which the Souls ascend To Day again, and in new Bodies live, After five thousand Years: forgetful quite Of all that pass'd in Pluto's dreary Realms. Grim Death, thro' all these Ways, with horrid Grin, Stalks to and fro, and passes ev'ry Gate.— Sil. Ital. Lib. XIII. But me, since Love was still my tender Vow, Venus shall lead to happy Meads below: There Songs perpetual charm the list'ning Ear, Whilst all the feather'd Wand'rers of the Air, To join the Sound, their warbling Throats prepare. Cassia from ev'ry Hedge unbidden breathes, And to the Gales it's fragrant Sweets bequeaths: The bounteous Earth it's purple Product yields, And od'rous Roses paint the blushing Fields. There Trains of blooming Youths, and tender Maids Sport on the Green, and wanton in the Shades; While busy Love attends them all the Way, Joins in the Conflict, and provokes the Fray. There ev'ry One by hasty Death betray'd, The faithful Lover, and the constant Maid, Above the rest distinguish'd, all repair, And bind with Myrtle Wreaths their flowing Hair.— Dart. Tibul. Lib. I. El. 3. Embrace. She Venus. said: and round Vulcan. him threw her snowy Arms, And warm'd him, wav'ring, with a soft Embrace: He soon receives the wonted Flame, which flies Swift thro' his Marrow, and his melting Bones: As when in Thunder, lanc'd along the Sky, A Streak of Fire runs streaming thro' the Clouds. Pleas'd with her Wiles, and conscious of her Charms, She silently perceives it: And involv'd In Love's eternal Bond the God replies. Whatever by my Art can be perform'd, I promise: Spare Intreaties, nor distrust Your Int'rest in my Soul. This said, He gave The wish'd Embrace, and sunk to pleasing Rest.— Trap. Æn. VIII. —See! wide-display'd, A grateful Poplar courts us with its Shade. The grassy Turf, beneath, so verdant shows, Let us thereon delightfully repose: With her Adonis here be Venus bless'd: And swift at once the Grass and him she press'd. Then sweetly smiling, with a raptur'd Mind, On his lov'd Bosom she her Head reclin'd, And thus began:—but mindful still of Bliss, Seal'd the soft Accents with a softer Kiss.— Dryden. Ovid. Met. Lib. X. Embroidery. With rich Embroidery, the curious Maid, Her native Heav'n, and th' Elements display'd: How parent Nature hush'd the ancient Wars Of huddled Chaos, and its inbred Jars: Sever'd the Seeds: and suiting to their Kind, To proper Places all the Parts assign'd. Sublimely born, the Light ascend on high: The Heavier sink, and in the middle lye: The Sky is lighted up: the Planets roll: And active Flame informs the rapid Pole: And flow the Seas, and pour their Waves along: And Earth suspended on her Ballance hung. In various Colours she express'd the Whole: With Gold the Stars are kindl'd: purple roll The washing Billows: and bright Gems display An imitated Shore, to bound the seeming Sea. The mimic Waves, so curious is her Skill, Deceive the Sight, and really seem to swell. The gath'ring Ooze the slimy Rock besmears, And working, in a Foam, the Main appears, Dashing upon the Sands, and murm'ring to the Ears. The World's five Zones she adds: the torrid One Glows with the Fervor of th' incessant Sun. The habitable Two, a milder Sky Does with more gentle Heat and calmer Beams supply. At both the Poles eternal Winter reigns, And bitter Frost the bleaky Robe constrains, Shiv'ring to Sight, and bound with icy Chains.— Hughes alter'd. Claud. Rapt. Pros. Lib. I. Enchantress. See Circe. Magic Power. She undertakes with Charms to disengage Whom e'er she pleases, Others to involve In restless Cares: makes rapid Streams stand still, And backwards turns the Stars: from Hell she calls Nocturnal Ghosts: the Ground, you'll see, will groan Beneath her Feet, and Oaks from Hills descend.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. IV. —Now with her Tresses loose, The Priestess thunders o'er three hundred Gods, Erebus, Chaos, three shap'd Hecate, Virgin Diana's triple Form. The Place With fancy'd Waters of Avernus' Fount She sprinkles. Herbs are brought by Moonlight mow'd With brazen Scythes, big, swoln with milky Juice Of noxious Poyson: and the fleshy Knot Torn from the Forehead of a new-foal'd Colt To rob the Mother's Love.— Id. Ibid. Three Nights were only wanting to compleat The Time when Luna's bending Horns should meet: When, at the full, in all her Lustre bright, She shone on Earth, a solid Globe of Light. Medea, the Enchantress, at the Intreaty of her Husband Jason, by the Force of her Magic Power, restores Youth and Vigour to his Father Æson, who was then very old and feeble. Medea leaves the Court, all loosely drest, Naked her Feet, her Hair a-down her Breast: Thro' the dead Silence of the Night she strays, Alone, in desart unfrequented Ways. Men, Beasts, and Birds were wrapp'd in gentle Sleep, No Murmurs thro' the peaceful Hedges sweep: No Air the Leaves, no Sounds disturb the Air: Stars only glitter in the silent Sphere. To them she lifts her Hands with awful View; Thrice turns, thrice sprinkles o'er her Hair with Dew: Thrice fills the trembling Air with yelling Sound: Then, bending, kneels upon the naked Ground. O, Night! thou Friend to Secrecy, she cries; Ye Stars, that nightly with the Moon arise! Thou! triple Hecate! conscious of my Thought, By whom the Wonders of my Skill are wrought: Ye Charms, and magic Arts! Thou friendly Earth! Whose Bosom gives our pow'rful Simples Birth: Ye Mountains! Fields! Ye Winds! Thou Mother Air! Ye murm'ring Springs! Ye Lakes and Rivers! hear:— Ye Gods of Woods! and Gods of Night, appear. By You I Rivers to their Fountains force; While the Banks wonder at their backward Course: Purge off the Clouds, the Skies with Clouds deform: Storms turn to Calms, and make a Calm a Storm: Raise high the Winds, again to Silence awe: And split, with mystic Spells, the Viper's Jaw. I cleave the Rocks, the knotted Oaks I break, Remove the Forests, and the Mountains shake: Force Earth to groan thro' all her hollow Caves, And wake the slumb'ring Ghosts in silent Graves: Thee too, O Luna! from thy Sphere I call, Tho' Brass relieves Thee, and obstructs thy Fall. Now I need Juices which can turn back Time, Make Age reflourish with a youthful Prime, Vig'rous and strong:—And I my Wish shall gain, For sure those Stars now twinkle not in vain: Nor hither now in vain these Dragons fly With the wing'd Car;— Just then the Car descended from the Sky. Nimbly she mounts, and strokes the Dragons' Mains, And o'er their Necks she shakes the airy Reins. Aloft they soar; beneath her she espies Thessalian Tempe; thence for Crete she hies. For Herbs she seeks on Pelion's lofty Head, And those that Ossa, and that Othrys bred, The Growth of Pindus, and Olympus' Fruits: Some she approves, and gathers by the Roots: And other Plants her brazen Sickle mows.— Nine Days and Nights had now her Chariot seen, Searching each ranker Mead, and flow'ry Green: She then return'd:—nor Food her Dragons knew, But the strong Scents which from her Simples flew: Yet their old Skins fell off, and Youth return'd a-new. Arriv'd, without the Palace-Gate she lies, Her bare Head cover'd only by the Skies, And the polluting Touch of Man denies. Now she two Altars rais'd of equal Height, To Youth the left, to Hecate the right: With Vervain and green Herbage these she crown'd, And dug two Trenches near them on the Ground. Then stuck the black fleec'd Rams, that ready stood, And drench'd the Trenches with devoted Blood. Vessels of smoaking Milk, and Wine she pours, And mutters Charms to the terrestrial Pow'rs. To Pluto King of Ghosts she next apply'd, And gentle Proserpine his ravish'd Bride: That, for old Æson, with the Laws of Fate They would dispense, and lengthen out his Date. These with repeated Pray'rs she long assails, And by her magic Skill at last prevails: Then calls to have decrepid Æson brought, And stupifies him with a sleeping Draught: On Earth his Body like a Corpse extends: Then charges Jason, and his waiting Friends, To quit the Place; that no unhallow'd Eye Into her Art's forbidden Secrets pry.— They go.—Medea with her Hair unbound, About her Altars trips a frantic Round, In Pieces splits the consecrated Wood, And dips them in the Trenches drench'd with Blood, Then on the Altars burns: The sleeping Sire She lustrates thrice with Water, Sulphur, Fire. Now in the Cauldron boils the grand Receipt, And works, and foams, and whitens with the Heat: She adds what e'er Hæmonia's Vales produce, Roots, Juices, Flowers, and Seeds of sov'reign Use, And Gems in India's utmost Bounds refin'd, And Stones, that Seas retiring, left behind, And Dews, collected at the Noon of Night, When the Moon shines, in her full Glory, bright. To these she puts the Carcass rank and foul, And Wings, ill-boding, of the screaming Owl: The Bowels of a Wolf, the Sort that can Assume or quit the Features of a Man: The scaly Skins of small Cyniphean Snakes, The Liver of a long-liv'd Hart she takes; And, last, a Crow's old Beak, and hoary Head, On which nine Ages had their Winters shed. All these were mixt by the Barbarian Dame, These, and a thousand more without a Name, But for her Purpose fit.—The Med'cine now She mingles with a wither'd Olive Bough: When, lo! the Bough all dry so lately seen, Stirr'd in the pow'rful Cauldron turns to Green: Then by Degrees the leafy Branches shoot, And soon stand loaded with a Weight of Fruit. Then too, where e'er the Froth was scatter'd round, And the warm Mixture had be-dropp'd the Ground, Sudden to Sight a springing Herbage grew, And vernal Flowers in various Colours blew. This when Medea saw, her Blade divides Old Æson's Throat; the frigid Blood scarce glides. His empty'd Vessels, instant she recruits, With the warm Juices of her magic Fruits: While at his Mouth, and thro' his op'ning Wound, A double Inlet her Infusion found: His Hair and Beard the hoary Whiteness leaves; A glossy Blackness each at once receives. Paleness and Wrinkles from his Features fled, And in their Stead succeeds a youthful Red: Now a full Tide of Blood his Veins supplies, His Limbs grow lusty, and his Muscles rise.— Ov. Met. Lib. VII. Admiring Æson now himself surveys, And to his Mind recalling former Days, Gay, strong, and active to himself appears, As e'er he counted his last forty Years.— Gay and Sewell alt. There I Canidia saw, her Feet were bare, Tuck'd up her sable Robe, and loose her Hair: With her fierce Sagana went stalking round; Their hideous Howling shook the trembling Ground. A Paleness (casting Horror round the Place) Sat, dead and terrible, on either's Face. Themselves at Length upon the Earth they cast, And dug it with their Nails in frantic Haste: Then with their Teeth a Coal-black Lamb they tore, And in the Pit pour'd out the reeking Gore. By this they forc'd the tortur'd Ghosts from Hell, And Answers to their wild Demands compel. Of Wool and Wax they made two Images, Which the bewitch'd and Witch's Forms express, Of Wool the Greater to torment the Less. The Wax was to be whipp'd, and seem'd to bow, And cringing stood, as if it fear'd the Blow. On Hecate aloud this Beldam calls, Tisiphone as loud the other bawls:— A thousand Serpents hiss upon the Ground, And Hell-hounds compass all the Garden round. Behind the Tombs, to shun this horrid Sight, The Moon skulk'd down.— Stafford alter'd. Hor. Lib. I. Sat. 8. From Towns and hospitable Roofs Erichtho, the Thessalian Sorceress. she flies, And ev'ry Dwelling of Mankind defies: Thro' unfrequented Desarts lonely roams, Drives out the Dead, and dwells within their Tombs. Grateful to Hell, the living Hag descends, And sits in black Assemblies of the Fiends: Spight of all Laws, which Heaven, or Nature know, The Rule of Gods above, or Man below. Dark matted Eft-locks dangling on her Brow, Filthy, and foul, a loathsome Burden grow: Meager, and ghastly pale, her Face is seen, Unknown to cheerful Day, and Skies serene: But when the Stars are veil'd, when Storms arise, And the blue forky Flame at Midnight flies, Then, forth from Graves, she takes her wicked Way, And thwarts the glancing Light'nings as they play. Where e'er she breathes, blue Poysons round her spread, The with'ring Grass avows her fatal Tread, And drooping Ceres hangs her blasted Head. Nor holy Rites, nor suppliant Pray'r she knows, Nor seeks the Gods with Sacrifice, or Vows: Whate'er she offers is the Spoil of Urns, And fun'ral Fire upon her Altars burns: Nor need she send a second Voice on high; Scar'd at the first, the trembling Gods comply.— Oft in the Grave, the living has she laid, And bid reviving Bodies leave the Dead: Oft at the fun'ral Pile she seeks her Prey, And bears the smoking Ashes warm away: Snatches some burning Bone, or flaming Brand, And tares the Torch from the sad Father's Hand: Seizes the Shroud's loose Fragments as they fly, And picks the Coal where clammy Juices fry. But, if preserv'd in Monuments of Stone, She finds a Coarse whose vital Moisture's gone: Then, greedily on every Part she flies, Strips the dry Nails, and digs the goary Eyes. Her Teeth from Gibbets gnaw the strangling Noose, And from the Cross dead Murderers unloose: The perish'd Entrails, pierc'd with soaking Showers, The horrid Hag rapaciously devours; And the parch'd Marrow, which the sultry Sun, With fervid Rays, has stiffen'd in the Bone. From Malefactors on the Tree, she steals The putrid Limbs, and crucifying Nails: The ropy Matter drops upon her Tongue, With cordy Sinews oft her Jaws are strung, And by her Teeth the Witch has often hung. Where on the Ground the murder'd Carcass lies, Thither, preventing Birds and Beasts, she hies: Yet, not with Hands or Knife the Flesh divides, Till the Wolves Fangs have rent the mangled Sides: But, when in full Possession of their Prey, She from their Jaws the Carcass rends away. Nor ever yet Remorse could stop her Hand, When human Gore her hellish Rites demand; From the cut Throat the vital Tide she drains, The panting Bowels takes, and empties all the Veins. Not in the Way ordain'd by Nature's Laws, But thro' a grisly Wound she wretch'd Infants draws; Reeking, upon her Altars these are laid, Or, if her Purpose asks a bolder Shade, By her keen Knife, the Ghost she wants, is made. When blooming Youths in early Manhood die, She stands a terrible Attendant by: The downy Growth from off their Cheeks she tares, Or cuts, left handed, some selected Hairs. Oft, when in Death her gasping Kindred lay, Some pious Office would she feign to pay; Stretch'd on the struggling Limbs, with dire Embrace, She'd churn the Cheeks, and grind the ruin'd Face: Eat off the Tongue, to the dry Palate bound, And thro' the livid Lips, with stifled Sound, Mutter dire Orders to the Shades profound. Her Art now doubling Night's surrounding Shade, Black Clouds and murky Fogs involve her Head, While o'er th' Sextus the Son of Pompey, enquiring the Event of the Civil War of the Sorceress Erichtho, she by her Magic Art raised up a dead Body to answer his Demands. unbury'd Heaps her Footsteps tread. Wolves howl'd, and fled, where'er she took her Way, And hungry Vultures left their mangled Prey: The Savage Race, abash'd, before her yield, And, while she culls her Prophet, quit the Field. To various Carcasses by turns she flies, And, griping with her gory Fingers, tries: Till one of perfect Organs can be found, And fibrous Lungs, uninjur'd by a Wound. Her Choice she fix'd; then, void of Pity, struck, In thro' the bleeding Throat, a brazen Hook: To that a Rope she ty'd, and by the Thong, O'er rugged Rocks she haul'd the Corps along. And, now, she for the solemn Task prepares, A Mantle, patch'd with various Shreds, she wears, And binds, with twining Snakes, her wilder Hairs. Then, thro' a fresh Incision at the Breast, Hot Blood she pours, to circulate the rest. Wipes off the Gore, the frozen Bosom warms, And with strong Lunar Dews confirms her Charms. Her gabling Tongue a mutt'ring Tone confounds, Discordant, and unlike to human Sounds: It seem'd, of Dogs the Bark, of Wolves the Howl, The doleful Shrieking of the midnight Owl: The Hiss of Snakes, the hungry Lion's Roar, The Bound of Billows beating on the Shore: The Groan of Winds amongst the leafy Wood, And Burst of Thunder from the rending Cloud: 'Twas these, all these in one.— Foaming she spoke: then rear'd her hateful Head, And hard at hand beheld th' attending Shade. Too well the trembling Sprite the Carcass knew, And fear'd to enter into Life a new: Fain from those mangled Limbs it would have run, And, loathing, strove that House of Pain to shun. Wroth was the Hag at lingring Death's Delay, And wonder'd Hell could dare to disobey: With curling Snakes, the senseless Trunk she beats, And Curses dire, at ev'ry Lash, repeats: With magic Numbers cleaves the groaning Ground, And makes Hell's Caverns with her Voice resound. Ye Fiends! she cries, Ye Sisters of Despair! Thus?—Is it thus my Will becomes your Care? Still sleep those Whips within your idle Hands, Nor drive the loit'ring Ghost this Voice demands?— And now the Blood, dissolving in the Veins, Feeds the black Wounds, and thro' the Body strains: The vital Vessels feel the running Heat, And in the Breast the trembling Fibres beat: New Life return'd, but 'twas not perfect Life, For Death as yet maintain'd the equal Strife: But strait the Nerves are stretch'd, the Muscles swell, And every Pulse distends it's narrow Cell. Then rose, erect, the Body from the Ground, Not by Degrees, but with a sudden Bound. The haggard Eyes forgotten Day behold, And heavily within their Sockets roll'd: But hardly half alive appears the Man, Stiff are the Members, and the Visage wan: Amaz'd, and mute, the ghastly Figure stands, Nor knows to speak, but at her dread Commands.— Rowe. Hughes alter'd. Lucan. Lib. VI. End. Purpose of Life. Hast Thou not yet propos'd some certain End, To which thy Life, thy ev'ry Act may tend? Hast Thou no Mark, at which to bend thy Bow? Or like a Boy pursu'st the Carrion Crow With Pellets, or with Stones, from Tree to Tree, A fruitless Toil, and liv'st Extempore.— Dryden. Pers. Sat. III. What aim'st Thou at, and whither tends thy Care? In what thy utmost Good?—Delicious Fare: And then to sun thy self in open Air.— Hold, hold: are all thy empty Wishes such? A good old Woman would have said as much.— Id. Pers. Sat. IV. Envy. She sought out Envy in her dark Abode, Defil'd with ropy Gore and Clots of Blood: Shut from the Winds, and from the wholsome Skies, In a deep Vale the gloomy Dungeon lies, Dismal and cold, where not a Beam of Light Invades the Winter, or disturbs the Night. A poisonous Morsel in her Teeth she chew'd, And gorg'd the Flesh of Vipers for her Food. Minerva, loathing, turn'd away her Eye: The hideous Monster, rising heavily, Came stalking forwards, with a sullen Pace, And left her mangled Offals on the Place. Soon as she saw the Goddess gay and bright, She fetch'd a Groan at such a chearful Sight. Livid and meager were her Looks, her Eye In foul distorted Glances turn'd awry: A Hoard of Gall her inward Parts possess'd, And spread a Greenness o'er her canker'd Breast: Her Teeth were brown with Rust: and from her Tongue, In dangling Drops, the stringy Poison hung. She never smiles, but when the Wretched weep, Nor lulls her Malice with a Moment's Sleep: Restless in Spite! while, watchful to destroy, She pines and sickens at another's Joy: Foe to herself, distressing and distress'd, She bears her own Tormentor in her Breast. She takes her Staff hung round with Wreaths of Thorn, And sails along, in a black Whirlwind born, O'er Fields and flow'ry Meadows; where she steers Her baneful Course a mighty Blast appears, Mildews, and Blights: the Meadows are defac'd, The Fields, the Flow'rs, and the whole Year laid Waste. On Mortals next, and peopled Towns she falls, And breathes a burning Plague among their Walls. When Athens she beheld, for Arts renown'd, With Peace made happy, and with Plenty crown'd: Scarce could the hideous Fiend from Tears forbear, To find out Nothing that deserv'd a Tear.— Addison. She stroak'd the Virgin with her canker'd Hand, Then prickly Thorns into her Breast convey'd, That stung to Madness the devoted Maid: Her subtle Venom still improves the Smart, Frets in the Blood, and festers in the Heart. To make the Work more sure, a Scene she drew, And plac'd before the dreaming Virgin's View Her Sister's Marriage, and her glorious Fate: Th' imaginary Bride appears in State: The Bridegroom with unwonted Beauty glows: For Envy magnifies whate'er she shows. Full of the Dream Aglauros pin'd away In Tears all Night, in Darkness all the Day: Consum'd like Ice, that just begins to run, When feebly smitten by the distant Sun: Or like unwholesome Weeds, that set on Fire Are slowly wasted, and in Smoke expire. Giv'n up to Envy (for in ev'ry Thought The Thorns, the Venom, and the Vision wrought,) Oft did she call on Death— Addison. Ovid. Met. Lib. II. —The meager Envious rise, And look on others Wealth with troubled Eyes: Griev'd to the Soul, they inwardly repine, That some with Pow'r, and some with Honour shine: While they are mean, and low, and without Fame: And even die for Statues and a Name.— Creech. Lucret. Lib. III. Envy thou cursed Plague of Humankind! To whom another's Happiness, or Praise, Is Pain insufferable!— Sil. Ital. Lib. XVI. Equinoctial-Line. Bright Phœbus, here, to neither Pole declines, But from his Zenith vertically shines: Hence, ev'n the Trees no friendly shelter yield, Scarce their own Trunks the leafy Branches shield; The Rays descend direct, all round embrace, And almost to a Point the Shadow chace. Here equally the middle Line is found, To cut the radiant Zodiac in it's Round: Here unoblique the Bull and Scorpion rise, Nor mount too swift, nor leave too soon the Skies: Nor Libra does too long the Ram attend, Nor bids the Maid the fishy Sign descend. The Twins and Centaur justly Time divide, And equally their several Seasons guide: Alike the Crab and wintry Goat return, Alike the Lion and the flowing Urn. Here slow Bootes, with his lazy Wain, Descending, seems to reach the watry Main. Of all the Lights which high above they see, No Star whate'er from Neptune's Waves is free, The whirling Axle drives 'em round, and plunges in the Sea.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. IX. Equinox. When Libra weighs the Hours in equal Scales, Nor Day on Night, nor Night on Day prevails: For Work, and Rest, when equal Times are made, The World enjoying equal Light and Shade.— Anon. Virg. Geor. Lib. I. But when the genial Heat began to shine, With stronger Beams in Aries' vernal Sign, Again the golden Day resum'd it's Right, And rul'd in just Equation with the Night.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. IV. The Sun, returning, in his yearly Race, To Cancer's Sign, meets Aries midst the Space, Seated between the Point from whence he bends His upward Course, and that in which he ends. There plac'd as Umpire in the middle Way, O'er all the Globe he equals Night and Day. Oppos'd to Aries, Libra's Stars appear, With the like Power to sway the rolling Year: It equals Day and Night.— Creech. Manil. Lib. III. Evening. And now the Village Tops at distance smoke, And longer Shades from lofty Mountains fall.— Trap. Virg. Ecl. I. Behold the Oxen homewards draw the Plough, Less lab'ring with it's Weight: and now the Sun, Retiring, doubles the increasing Shades.— Id. Virg. Ecl. II. At the Sun's Setting, Vesper's cooling Breeze Allays the Fervor of the sultry Air: And now the Groves are by the dewy Moon Refresh'd: the Shores Halcyone resound: And the sweet Goldfinch warbles thro' the Brakes.— Trap. alter'd. Virg. Georg. Lib. III. The Labour of the Day now near an End, From steep Olympus Phœbus' Steeds descend.— Sewell. Ovid. Met. Lib. VI. Half hid in Seas descending Phœbus lay, And upwards half, half downwards shot the Day.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. VIII. Bright Sol had now his Journey almost done, And to the western Ocean downward run.— Ovid. Met. Lib. XI. Now o'er the Skies is spread that doubtful Light, Which cannot Day be call'd, nor is it Night. Ov. Met. IV. Now headlong to the West the Sun was fled, And half in Seas obscur'd his beamy Head: Such seems the Moon, while, growing yet, she shines, Or waining, from her fuller Orb declines.— Id. Lucan. Lib. III. 'Twas at that Season when the fainting Light, Just in the Evening's close, brought on the Night.— Lucan. Lib. IV. Example. See Education. Fuscinus, those ill Deeds that sully Fame, And lay such Blots upon an honest Name: In Blood once tainted, like a Current run, From the lewd Father, to the lewder Son. If Gaming does an aged Sire entice, Then my young Master quickly learns the Vice, And shakes, in Hanging-Sleeves, the little Box and Dice. Thus, the voluptuous Youth, bred up to dress, For his fat Gransire, some delicious Mess: In feeding high his Tutor will surpass, As Heir-apparent of the Gourmand Race. And, should a thousand grave Philosophers Be always hollowing Temp'rance in his Ears, They would at last their Loss of Time lament, And give him o'er, as Glutton by Descent. Can cruel Rutilus, who loves the Noise Of Whips far better than a Syren's Voice, Set up to teach Humanity, and give By such Example, Rules for Us to live? Can he preach up Equality of Birth, And tell Us how we all began from Earth? Can he a Son to soft Remorse incite, Whom Goals, and Chains, and Punishments delight? Who would expect the Daughter should be other Than common Punk, if Larga be the Mother? Whose Lovers Names in order to run o'er, The Girl took Breath full thirty times, and more: She, when but yet a tender Minx, began To hold the Door, but now sets up for Man: And to her Gallants, in her own Hand-writing, Sends Billets-douxs of the old Bawd's Inditing. So Nature prompts: so soon we go astray, When old Experience puts Us in the Way: Our green Youth copies what grey Sinners act, When venerable Age commends the Fact.— Dryden jun. alter'd. Juv. Sat. XIV. My honour'd Father did his Precepts use By Force of strong Example to infuse: 'Twas so he labour'd to direct my Will, Point me to Good, or turn me back from Ill. When studious to inculcate frugal Care, And make me happy with what ever Share Of Riches he should leave: Observe, said He, How wretched Albus' Son and Barus be: Young Heirs, to squander their Estates inclin'd, In their sad Fate may good Instruction find. When to deter me from the shameful Love Of vile seducing Prostitutes he strove, Beware, he'd cry: nor like Sectanus prove. That after Others Wives I should not stray, Nor follow Women in a lawless Way: Thereby, quoth he, Trebonius is undone; Caught in the Fact, his Reputation's gone. —Thus he Did in my Non-age wisely tutor me. When he propos'd a Duty to be done, Thou hast, he'd cry, a fair Example, Son, Before thine Eyes, for doing of the same: And then some Great and Worthy Man he'd Name. But, if a Vice he caution'd me to fly, A Man, says he, may see with half an Eye; This Action, which Thou'rt now about to do, Is against Honesty, and Int'rest too: For the same Thing, there's such and such a One, With Infamy is branded thro' the Town.— Hor. Lib. I. Sat. 4. True Toil and Virtue learn, dear Youth, from Me: Fortune from Others.— Be Thou industrious, when mature of Age, To fix these great Examples in thy Mind, And them revolving, copy out thy Sire Æneas, and thy Unkle Hector's Fame.— Trap. Æn. Lib. XII. Exhortation. See Reproach. Ah! whither fly you? By yourselves, my Friends! And your brave Deeds; by King Evander's Name And Conquests gain'd in War: By my own Hopes, Which burn to emulate my Father's Praise; Trust not to Flight: A Passage thro' the Foes Must with the Sword be hewn: where thickest crouds That Globe of Troops: That Way, Yourselves and Me Pallas your Chief, our Country's Glory calls. No Gods oppose Us: By a mortal Foe Mortals Ourselves are urg'd: As many Lives And Hands are Ours, as Theirs: Behold the Sea Confines Us here: No Land remains for Flight: To Troy shall We repair? or stem the Deep?— Trap. Æn. Lib. X. Shall Cicero to Pompey. Cæsar stand against the World combin'd, Protract Destruction, and embroil Mankind? What will the vanquish'd Nations murm'ring say, Where once thy Conquests cut their winged Way, When they behold thy lazy Virtue now, And see Thee move thus languishing and slow? Where are those Fires that warm'd thee to be Great? That stable Soul, and Confidence in Fate? Canst thou the Gods ungratefully mistrust?— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. VII. If Men, if Multitudes can make Us strong: Behold what Tribes unnumber'd march along! Where-e'er the Zodiac turns it's radiant Round, Where-ever Earth, or People, can be found, To Us the Nations issue forth in swarms, And in Rome's Cause all human Nature Arms. What then remains, but that our Wings enclose, Within their ample Fold, our shrinking Foes? Thousands, and Thousands, useless, may we spare, Yon handful will not half employ our War. Id. Ibid. If the dear Pledges of connubial Love, Your Houshold Gods, and Rome, your Souls can move, Hither by Fate they seem together brought, And for this Prize, to Day, the Battle shall be fought.— Id. Ibid. Think from the Summit of the Roman Wall, You hear our loud-lamenting Matrons call: Think with what Tears, what lifted Hands they sue, And place their last, their only Hopes in You. Imagine kneeling Age before You spread, Each hoary reverend majestic Head: Your Aid, by Rome herself, believe implor'd, To save her from a proud imperious Lord. Think how the present Age, how that to come, What Multitudes from you expect their Doom: On your Success dependent all rely: These to be born in Freedom, Those to die. Ah! think, if after what I've nam'd before, Ought still remains, that can affect you more: Think you behold (were such a Posture meet) Ev'n me, your Pompey, prostrate at your Feet. Myself, my Wife, my Sons, a suppliant Band, From You our Lives, and Liberties demand: Or conquer You, or I to Exile born, My last dishonourable Years shall mourn, Your long Reproach, and my proud Father's Scorn. From Bonds, from Infamy, your Gen'ral save, Nor let this hoary Head descend to Earth a Slave.— Id. Lucan. Lib. VII. Between Extreams, to Day, our Fortune lies, The vilest Punishment, and noblest Prize. Consider well the Captive's lost Estate, Chains, Racks, and Crosses for the Vanquish'd wait: My Limbs are each allotted to its Place, And my pale Head the Rostrum's Height shall grace. But that's a Thought unworthy Cæsar's Care:— Much more for you than for myself I fear. On my good Sword securely I rely, And, if I conquer not, am sure to die.— Id. Ibid. Experience. By various Proofs Experience Art has form'd: Example being Guide.— Manil. Let Stoicks Ethics haughty Rules advance, To combat Fortune, and to conquer Chance: Yet happy Those, who not so learn'd, are thought, Whom Life instructs, tho' by Experience taught. For new to come, from past Misfortunes, look: Nor shake the Yoke, which galls the more 'tis shook.— Creech. Juv. Sat. XIII. Ev'n from old Age does some Advantage rise, For in the hoary Head Experience lies.— Ov. Met. VI. The Seaman best can reason of the Winds, Of Oxen none so well as lab'ring Hinds: Battles and Wounds the Soldiers best describe, And what belongs to Sheep the Shepherd Tribe.— Propert. The Fowler and the Huntsman know full well, The Haunts of Birds, and Beasts, and where they dwell: The artful Angler, in the winding Brook, Knows what the Fish, and how to bait his Hook.— Ovid. Art. Amand. Lib. I. Nothing, at first, so great, so strange appears, But that the Wonder, by Degrees abates, And it becomes familiar.— Lucret. Lib. II. Ne'er did Man cast up the Business of his Life so exactly, but still Experience, Years, and Custom, will bring in some new Particulars he was not aware of, and shew his Ignorance of what he thought he knew, and after Trial make him reject his former Opinions.— Eachard. Teren. Adelp. Extravagance. See Gluttony. Luxury. Centronius does high costly Villas raise With Grecian Marble, which the Sight amaze: Some stand upon Cajeta's winding Shore; At Tyber's Tow'r, and at Præneste more. The Dome of Hercules and Fortune show, To his tall Fabricks, like small Cots below. In mighty Buildings his Estate out-run, Descends diminish'd greatly to his Son. His Son builds on, and cannot be content, Till the last Farthing is in Structure spent.— Dryd. alter'd. Juv. Sat. XIV. A costly Gem from his Metella's Ear, Æsop's loose Son dissolv'd in Vinegar: And drank it down, and then profusely laugh'd, To think he drank a Province at a Draught. Was't not as mad as to have thrown the Gem, Into some common Shore, or rapid Stream.— Creech. Hor. Lib. II. Sat. 3. Many there are of the same wretched Kind, Whom their despairing Creditors may find Lurking in Shambles: where with borrow'd Coin They buy choice Meats, and in cheap Plenty dine: Such whose sole Bliss is eating: who can give But that one brutal Reason why they live. And yet, what's more ridiculous; of these The poorest Wretch is still most hard to please: And he whose thin transparent Rags declare How much his tatter'd Fortune wants Repair, Would ransack ev'ry Element, for Choice Of ev'ry Fish and Fowl, at any Price: If brought from far, if very dear it cost, It has a Flavour then, which pleases most, And he devours it with a greater Gust. In Riot thus, while Money lasts, he lives, And that exhausted, still new Pledges gives: Till forc'd of meer Necessity, to eat, He comes to pawn his Dish to buy his Meat. Nothing of Silver or of Gold he spares, Nor what his Mother's sacred Image bears: Nor can his earthen Ware escape the Sale, To help defray a dear luxurious Meal.— Congreve. Juv. Sat. XI. —Thou, Damasippus, Art forc'd to make the Stage thy last Retreat, And pawn thy Voice, the All thou hast, for Meat: For now Thou must, (since thy Estate is lost,) Or represent, or be thyself a Ghost.— Stepny alter'd. Juv. Sat. VIII. As I was coming along to Day, I stumbled upon one of my own Rank and Quality, who had made a shift to guzzle away an Estate. Seeing such a rough, nasty, meager Fellow, rigg'd out with Rags and Rheumatisms, What's the Meaning of this fine Dress? (quoth I,) Alas! (said he,) I had an Estate once, but play'd the Fool, and cou'd n't keep it, and you see what I am brought to: All my Friends and Acquaintance fly me as they wou'd the Plague.— Eachard. Teren. Eun. Fame. Fame, direful Pest! in Speed outstrip'd by none: That flying grows, and Strength by Motion gains. Tim'rous at first she is, and small thro' Fear, But, by Degrees grown bold, herself in Air Sublime she rears, and walking on the Ground, Conceals her tow'ring Head among the Clouds. Her, the last Sister to Enceladus, And Cæus, as 'tis said, the Parent Earth, Provok'd by Anger of the Gods, brought forth: Swift with her Feet, and never-weary'd Wings. A Monster hideous, vast!—As many Plumes As in her Body stick, so many Eyes For ever waking, (wondrous to relate!) There grow beneath: as many babling Tongues, And list'ning Ears as many.—By Night she flies, Noisy, thro' Shades obscure, 'twixt Earth and Heav'n: Nor are her Eyes by pleasing Slumber clos'd. Watchful, and prying round, by Day, she sits On some high Palace Top, or lofty Tow'r, And mighty Towns alarms: not less intent On spreading Falshood, than reporting Truth.— Trap. alt. Virg. Æn. IV. Amidst the World, between Earth, Air, and Sea, A Place there is, the Confine of all three: Hence Things, how e'er remote, are view'd around; Here ev'ry Voice is heard, and ev'ry Sound. FAME's Palace on the Summit stands on high, And Ways thereto innumerable lye; A thousand Entrances on every Side, All without Gates, are ever open wide. Built all of Brass, the ringing Walls resound, And Tales repeated eccho all around. No Rest within, no Silence, yet the Noise Not loud, but like the Whispers of a Voice: Such as from far by rolling Billows sent, Or as Jove's fainting Thunder almost spent. Hither in Crowds the Vulgar come and go, Millions of Rumours here fly to and fro: Lies mixt with Truth, Reports that vary still, The itching Ears of Folks unguarded fill. They tell the Tale, the Tale in telling grows, And each Relater adds to what he knows. Rash Error, light Credulity are here, And causeless Transport, and ill-grounded Fear; New rais'd Sedition, secret Whispers blown By nameless Authors, and of Things unknown. FAME, all that's done in Heav'n, Earth, Ocean, views, And o'er the World still hunts around for News.— Theobald alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. XII. Famine. Where frozen Scythia's utmost Bound is plac'd, A Desart lies, a melancholy Waste: In yellow Crops there Nature never smil'd, No fruitful Tree to shade the barren Wild. There sluggish Cold its icy Station makes, There Paleness, Frights, and aguish Trembling shakes, Of pining Famine this the fated Seat.— There in a stony Field the Fiend she found, Herbs knawing, and Roots scratching from the Ground. Her Elfelock Hair in matted Tresses grew, Sunk were her Eyes, and pale her ghastly Hue, Wan were her Lips, and foul with clammy Glew: Her Throat was furr'd: her Guts appear'd within With snaky Curlings thro' her Parchment Skin. Her jutting Hips seem'd starting from their Place, And for a Belly was a Belly's Space. Her Dugs hung dangling from her craggy Spine, Loose to her Breast, and fasten'd to her Chine. Her Joints protuberant by Leanness grown, Consumption sunk the Flesh, and rais'd the Bone. Her Knees large Orbits bunch'd to monstrous Size, And Ankles to undue Proportion rise.— Vernon. Ovid. Met. Lib. VIII. In vain the fallow Fields the Peasant tills, The Seed, corrupted e'er tis sown, she kills. The fruitful Soil, that once such Harvests bore, Now mocks the Farmer's Care, and teems no more. All the rich Grain which fills the furrow'd Glade, Rots in the Seed, or shrivels in the Blade: Or too much Sun burns up, or too much Rain Drowns, or black Blights destroy the blasted Plain: Or greedy Birds the new-sown Seed devour, Or Darnel, Thistles, and a Crop impure Of knotted Grass, along the Acres stand, And spread their thriving Roots thro' all the Land.— Maynwaring. Ovid. Met. Lib. V. —And now, Her baleful Visage meager Famine rears: Seldom alone, she troops among the Fiends, And still on War and Pestilence attends.— Unpress'd, unstraiten'd by besieging Foes, All Miseries of Want the Soldier knows: Gladly he gives his little Wealth, to eat, And buys a Morsel with his whole Estate. Curst Merchandize! where Life it self is sold, And Avarice consents to starve for Gold.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. IV. But while the distant War no more he fears, Famine, a worse, resistless Foe appears. No more the Fields their grassy Pasture yield, Nor waving Harvests crown the yellow Field. On ev'ry verdant Leaf the hungry feed, And snatch the Forage from the fainting Steed: Then rav'nous on their Camp's Defence they fall, And grind with greedy Jaws the turfy Wall.— Id. Ibid. Fantom. See Ghost. Then (wondrous to behold!) the Goddess arms A visionary Fantom, light, and vain, From a thin Cloud, chang'd to Æneas' Shape: Decks it with Trojan Darts: his Shield, and Crest, And all the Honours of his God-like Head Dissembles: gives it empty Words, and Sound: And forms its Steps, and Manner, as it walks. Such Figures, as tis said, departed Ghosts Flutt'ring assume: or mimic Dreams by Night. In the first Van th' exulting Shade provokes The Hero, and with Darts, and Voice defies. Turnus advances fierce: and hurls from far A whistling Lance: The recreant Spirit flies. Close to the Covert of a lofty Rock A Ship by Chance there stood, with Ladders hung, And Bridges laid: To this with hasty Steps, The trembling Image of Æneas flies, And in its Hatches lurks. With Haste no less Turnus pursues, all Obstacles surmounts, And passes o'er the Bridges: When the Deck He scarce had reach'd, Saturnia bursts the Cords, And speeds the Vessel thro' the rolling Deep. —And now the mimic Form No longer lurks conceal'd: but mounts in Air Aloft, and mingles with a dusky Cloud; While Turnus in mid Ocean wasted sails.— Trap. Æn. X. Fate. See Chance. God. Foreknowledge. Providence. —In vain, Jupiter to Venus. fair Daughter, you essay To o'er-rule Destiny's unconquer'd Sway: Your Doubts to banish, enter Fate's Abode:— There you shall see the Records grav'd, in length, On Ir'n and solid Brass, with mighty Strength: Which Heav'n's and Earth's Concussion shall endure: Mauger all Shocks, eternal, and secure: There, on e'erlasting Adamant, design'd, The various Fortunes of your Race you'll find.— Welsted. Ovid. Met Lib. XV. Forbear to hope the Destinies divine Can ever with Intreaties be subdu'd.— Trap. Virg. Æn. VI. Fix'd stands the Date of mortal Lives: the Space Is short, and irretrievable to All.— Id. Æn. X. Great Jove himself the equal Ballance holds, And poises in it's Scales the Fates of both: One with Success is charg'd: and one descends Loaded with Death.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. XII. Mortals, your Minds of anxious Cares unload, Nor fruitlesly the Woes of Life bewail: Fate governs worldly Things: and fixt by Fate Is all that haps thro' long revolving Years. Our Death's fore-doom'd the Moment We are born, And the last Hour depends upon the first. Then, Wealth to some, and Kingdoms are decreed; But Poverty to most: The Mind to Arts, Or Manners, then is turn'd; to Vice, or Virtue. Then too the Evil and the Good of Life Is all predestin'd: for from it's Share of Evil No Life's exempt: tho' more than what's fore-doom'd None possibly can suffer.—Prayers nor Vows Ill Fortune can suspend, nor Flight avoid: But All must bear the Hardships Fate decrees.— Manil. Lib. IV. Besides, th' unnatural Civil Wars of Rome, Are Proofs of Fate's inevitable Doom. See Marius ride, with Cimbrian Lawrels crown'd, Then in the Dungeon, stretch'd upon the Ground: Now Slave, now Consul: Consul, Slave again: His Curule Chair succeeded by a Chain. Now a mean Ruin, on the Lybian Sands, Despis'd he lies: and now the World commands: Sudden, from the Minturnian Pools he rose, And scatter'd Vengeance on his haughty Foes. Changes thus strange, and much for Chance too great, Are not th' Effects of Fortune, but of Fate.— Who, Pompey, could (that saw thy conq'ring Fleet Regain the Seas, and Kings beneath thy Feet, Proud Pontus yield, fierce Tyrants make thy Train, And suppliant Monarchs beg thy Leave to reign; That saw victorious Lawrels crown thy Head, And conquer'd Worlds in thy three Triumphs led: And all that Glory which thy Sword had won Fixt, and supported by as great a Son,) Have thought that Thou, upon a foreign Sand, Should'st steal a Burial from a common Hand: That shatter'd Planks, the Seas dishonest Spoil, Should hiss beneath thy Trunk, and be thy Pile? That Thou, the mighty Thou, should'st want an Urn? What Power, but Fate, could work so strange a Turn? E'en Cæsar sprung from Heav'n, and now a Star, Tho' midst the Dangers of the Civil War Secure he stood— Yet crown'd with Peace, in all his mighty State, He fell, a Victim to o'er-ruling Fate: Not mere Suspicions, but clear Proofs were brought, He knew what Cassius spoke, and Brutus thought: How far advanc'd, how far they meant to go, And saw the Minute of the fatal Blow: Yet dark Oblivion did his Reason blot, He all his Warnings, and Himself forgot: And in the Senate, while his Right Hand held The faithful Paper which the Plot reveal'd, To prove that Fate does all the World controul, He fell, and with his Blood effac'd the Scroll.— Creech alt. Ibid. —If Fate does so ordain, A slight Disease destroys, while greater spare, Good Methods fail, and Men are lost by Care: Some, temperate Diet with Diseases fills, And Poison's innocent, when Physick kills.— Successless Virtue sinks, while Vice prevails: And Folly wins the Prize, when Prudence fails. He argues ill, that from the Fortune draws, The Goodness, or the Badness, of a Cause: Success on Merit does not always wait; Both Good and Bad are found amongst the Great. But some Almighty Pow'r's impetuous Force Marks out the Way, and still directs the Course: The Years that we must run; the Length, the Pace, And all the various Turnings of the Race.— Besides, were not Events by Fate enroll'd, How can their certain Order be foretold? How can the Prophets sing of future Doom, And, in the present, read the Age to come.— Nor does this Reasoning Wickedness defend, Or rob fair Virtue of it's happy End. Who ever lik'd the more a pois'nous Weed, Because 'tis bred from necessary Seed? Or who loves Corn the less, who hates the Vine, Because produc'd by Nature, not Design? Thus virtuous Minds deserve the greater Love, Since doom'd to act what Heaven must approve: And we should hate those most whom Fate has sent Crimes to commit, and suffer Punishment: For Crimes, from whatsoever Cause they flow, Are still the same:—since that they're Crimes We know.— Creech alter'd. Ibid. When You, ye Gods! are pleas'd to plague Mankind, Our own rash Hands are to the Task assign'd: By You ordain'd the Tools of Fate to be, We blindly act the Mischiefs You decree: We call the Battle, We the Sword prepare, And on ourselves draw on the dreadful War.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. VII. Sore sigh'd the anxious Chief, who well could read Some dire Delusion by the Gods decreed: He saw the Fates malignantly inclin'd, To thwart his Purpose, and perplex his Mind.— Idem. Ibid. The Fates embrace his Knees, with Hands that twine The Lot of all Things, human, and divine: And from the Threads on their eternal Reel, Whate'er shall hap thro' endless Ages deal.— Hughes alt. Claud. Rap. Pros. Faults. See Detraction. But some may cry, have You no Faults at all? Yes, other Faults, and not perhaps so small.— When Mænius rail'd at Novius, how, says One, Dost know thyself, or think thy Faults unknown? Pho, pho, says Mænius,—I forgive my own. This is a foolish, and a wicked Love, Such as the keenest Satyr should reprove. While thou art blind and senseless to thy own, How dost thou find another's Faults so soon, That scarce a Serpent can so quickly spy, Or any Eagle hath so sharp an Eye? But still go on: pursue thy mean Design, Shew Others Faults,—and they will shew thee thine.— Creech alter'd. Hor. Lib. I. Sat. 3. We all our Frailties share, and he's the best, Most happy he, who's loaded with the least. Those then, who would not have their Sores offend, Ought not to fret the Pimples of a Friend: And surely, 'tis but just, that he, who'd claim A candid Cov'ring where he proves to blame, Should to an erring Neighbour grant the same.— Anon. Ibid. Fear. See Fright. Panic. —Surpriz'd with Fear he back Recoil'd, and with his Speech repress'd his Steps.

I take th' Alarm, while Horrors reign around, At ev'ry Breeze, and start at ev'ry Sound. Now, to the City Gates approaching near, Æneas bearing his Father Anchises upon his Shoulders.I seem the Noise of trampling Feet to hear. My frighted Sire look'd forward thro' the Shade, And, fly my Son: they come, they come, he said: Lo! from their Shields I see the Splendors stream, And ken distinct the Helmet's fiery Gleam.— Pitt. Ibid. With Hearts dejected my Companions stood, And sudden Horrors froze their curdling Blood: Down drop the Shield and Spear; from Fight we cease, And humbly sue by suppliant Vows for Peace.— Id. Æn. Lib. III. Her Colour and her Voice forsake the Fair, And thrice her trembling Feet for Flight prepare: But still in vain, for Fear had fix'd 'em there.

So fares a Sailor on the stormy Main, When Clouds conceal Boötes' golden Wain: When not a Star it's friendly Lustre keeps, Nor trembling Cynthia glimmers on the Deeps: He dreads the Rocks, and Shoals, and Seas, and Skies, While Thunder roars, and Lightning round him flies.— Pope. Statius. Lib. I. Mean time on trembling Pinions thro' the Skies, To Mount One of the seven Hills of Rome. Palatium frighted Rumour flew, And to astonish'd Rome these Tidings bore:— A hostile Fleet is riding on the Main; And o'er the Alps, with German Conquests flush'd, The vengeful Legions pour on guilty Rome. Strait Fire, and Sword, and all the dreadful Train Of Civil Rage, before their Eyes appear! Distracting Tumults ev'ry Bosom sway'd, And Reason 'midst the dubious Fears was lost. This flies by Land: That rather trusts the Seas, As far less dang'rous than his native Shores: These run to Arms: Fate aids the wild Affright, And each obeys the Guidance of his Fears. No certain Course the giddy Vulgar know, But thro' the Gates in throng'd Confusion crowd, And rival Terror:—Rome to Rumour yields, And weeping Romans leave their native Seats. This in his Hand his trembling Children leads; And This his Gods within his Bosom hides, His long-lov'd Threshold quits with mournful Looks, And wings his Curses at the absent Foe. There on the Husband's Breast, the Bride complains: And here, his Father's Age a pious Youth Supports with filial Care, nor feels his Load, Nor fears but for his venerable Charge. While These, insensate! to the Field convey Their treasur'd Wealth, and glut the War with Spoil. As on the deep when stormy Auster blows, And mounts the Billows with tumultuous Rage, Th' affrighted Seamen ply their Arts in vain: The Pilots stand aghast: These lash their Sails: While These make Land, and Those avoid the Shores, And give up all to giddy Fortune's Pow'r.— Addison jun. Petron. Fidelity. He to the Shrines of Faith his Steps address'd. She, pleas'd with Secrets rolling in her Breast, Far from the World remote, revolv'd on high, The Cares of Gods, and Counsels of the Sky. E'er Jove was born she grac'd the bright Abodes, Consort of Justice, boast of Men and Gods: Without whose heavenly Aid, no Peace below, The stedfast Earth, and rolling Ocean, know.— Addison. Sil. Ital. Lib. II. While Earth the Seas shall in her Bosom bear, While Earth herself shall hang in ambient Air, While Phœbus shall his constant Task renew, While thro' the Zodiac Night shall Day pursue; No Faith, no Trust, no Friendship shall be known Among the jealous Partners of a Throne: But he who reigns, shall strive to reign alone.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. I. If, now, a Friend does not deny his Trust, But the old Purse restores with all it's Rust, 'Tis a prodigious Faith! and ought in Gold Among the Tuscan Annals be inroll'd: And a crown'd Lamb should sacrificed be To such a wonderful Integrity.— Juv.

Fire lies in ev'ry thing: in Clouds it forms The frightful Thunder, and delights in Storms: It passes thro' the Earth, in Ætna raves, And imitates Heav'n's Thunder in it's Caves: In hollow Vales it boils the rising Floods: In Flints 'tis found, and lodges in the Woods; For toss'd by Storms, the Trees in Flames expire;— So warm are Nature's Parts, so fill'd with Fire.— Creech.

Nor in your Vineyards let wild Olives grow: For oft, by careless Swains neglected Fire Is left: Which first beneath the unctious Bark Lurks unperceiv'd, invades the solid Wood, And, rising thro' the higher Leaves, to Heav'n With mighty Noise ascends: Then Victor reigns Thro' the Top-Branches, and Triumphant rides, Involving all the Grove in Flames: and throws A Cloud of pitchy Vapour to the Sky: Chiefly, if from the North a Tempest roars, And driv'n by Winds the blazing Torrent rolls.— Id. Georg. Lib. II. As when the wish'd for Winds in Summer rise, Thro' the thick Woods the Shepherd scatters Fire: The middle Trees blaze sudden, and at once Vulcan's dire Squadrons deluge all the Plains: He, pleas'd, sits viewing the triumphant Flames.— Id. Æn. L. X. The Clouds disperse in Fumes:— The The World set on Fire by Phaëton. High-Lands smoke, cleft by the piercing Rays, Or, clad with Woods, in their own Fuel blaze. Then o'er the Plains, where ripen'd Harvests grow, The running Conflagration spreads below: But these are trivial Ills: whole Cities burn, And peopled Kingdoms into Ashes turn.— Addison. Ovid. Met. Lib. II. I burn, I burn, like kindled Fields of Corn, When by the driving Winds the Flames are born.— Scroop. Sapho Phaoni. High, o'er the Dome, the Flames emblaze the Air: Fierce to devour, the fiery Tempest flies, Swells in the Wind, and thunders to the Skies.— Pitt. Æn. Lib. II. —With loosen'd Reins Among the Benches Vulcan rages fierce, Among the Oars, and Decks of painted Fir. —Beneath the warping Timber lives The smouldring Tow, and vomits lazy Smoke: A ling'ring Vapour eats the Ships, and o'er The Fleet's whole Bulk the pitchy Plague descends. Nor does the Labour of the Heroes aught Avail, nor Rivers pour'd upon the Flames.— Trap. Æn. Lib. V. He then commands, against the Ships to aim Darts, that with Pitch and livid Sulphur flame. The spreading Fire o'er-runs their unctious Sides, And, nimbly mounting, on the Top-Mast rides: Planks, Yards, and Cordage feed the dreadful Blaze, And sinking Vessels hiss amidst the Seas: While floating Arms and Men, promiscuous strow'd, Deform the Surface of the azure Flood. Nor does Destruction seize the Fleet alone, But, driv'n by Winds invades the neighb'ring Town: On rapid Wings the rolling Flames they bear, In wavy Lengths along the red'ning Air: Not much unlike, the shooting Meteors fly, In gleamy Trails, a-thwart the midnight Sky.— Rowe alter'd. Lucan. Lib. X. Firmness. See Fortitude. —Infatuate they demand The impious War, and obstinately crowd, With Tumult, round the King Latinus' Court. He like a Rock amidst the Sea, unmov'd, Stands opposite, resisting: like a Rock Amidst the Sea; which, while the roaring Tide Encroaches, with it's Weight Itself sustains Among the noisy Waves: in vain the Cliffs Foaming rebellow loud: and all around The broken Sea-Weed dashes on it's Sides.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. VII. He by no Tears is mov'd: untractable, And deaf to all Intreaties: Fate forbids: And Jove, o'er-ruling, stops his pitying Ears. As when rough Alpine Winds, with struggling Gusts, This way, and that, contend t' o'er-turn an Oak Stubborn with aged Timber: roaring loud The Branches bend: the stiff Trunk bows: the Leaves Thick falling strew the Ground: Itself fast clings, Fix'd in the Rocks: and high as it uprears It's tow'ring Head in Air, so deep it's Root Shoots downwards to the Center. With such Force, And ceaseless Noise, the Hero on all Sides Is batter'd: and within his manly Breast Confines the Pain he feels: his Mind persists Unmov'd: and Tears roll down his Cheeks in vain.— Id. Virg. Æn. Lib. IV. He, like a Rock, which o'er the Ocean wide Hangs prominent, expos'd to Winds and Waves, And all the Rage of Sea and Sky endures; Stands fix'd, unmov'd.— Id. Virg. Æn. Lib. X. Flattery. See Courtship. These prudent Folks are full of Flattery: They make a Wit of their insipid Friend, His blubber Lips, and beetle Brows commend: His long Crane-Neck, and narrow Shoulders praise, You'd think they were describing Hercules. A creaking Voice for a clear Treble goes, Tho' harsher than a Cock's that treads and crows.— Dryd. Juv. Sat. III. 'Tis all a Comedy: but laugh, and they Return it louder than an Ass can bray: Grieve, and they grieve: if You weep silently, There seems a silent Eccho in their Eye, They cannot mourn like You, but they can cry. Call for a Fire, their Winter Cloths they take, Begin but You to shiver, and they shake: In Frost and Snow if You complain of Heat, They rub th' unsweating Brow, and swear they sweat.— Ibid. Or Day, or Night, they're like a Looking-Glass, Still ready to reflect their Patron's Face: Their panegyrick Hand, and lifted Eye, Are still prepar'd for fulsome Flattery: Ev'n Nastiness Occasions will afford; They praise a belching or well-p?ss?ng Lord.— Id. Ibid. Nothing so monstrous can be said or feign'd, But with Belief and Joy is entertain'd, When to his Face the worthless Wretch is prais'd, Whom vile Court-Flatt'ry to a God has rais'd.— Duke. Juv. Sat. IV. Deceitful Flatt'ry does the Soul betray, As hollow Banks by Streams are worn away. Tell her, her Face is fair, her Hair is sweet, Her taper Fingers praise, and little Feet: Such Praises ev'n the Chaste are pleas'd to hear: Both Maids and Matrons hold their Beauty dear. Praise the proud Peacock, and he spreads his Train: Be silent, and he pulls it in again: Pleas'd is the Courser in his rapid Race, Applaud his running, and he mends his Pace,— Dryd. alt. Ovid. Art. I. Thou, who desir'st to keep the fair One's Heart, To flatter well apply thy utmost Art: With frequent Raptures on her Beauty gaze, And make her Form the Subject of thy Praise, Purple commend, when she's in Purple dress'd: In Scarlet, swear she looks in Scarlet best: Array'd in Gold, her graceful Mein adore, Vowing those Eyes transcend the sparkling Ore: If Crape she wears,—What can become her more! When dress'd in Colours, praise a colour'd Dress, Her Hair, or curl'd, or comb'd, commend no less. Singing, her Voice, dancing, her Air admire; Complain when she leaves off, and still desire.— Dryd. alt. Ovid. Art. II. In vain, mean Flatteries, ye try, To gnaw the Lip, and fall the Eye: No Man a God or Lord I name: From Romans far be such a Shame! Go teach the supple Parthian how To veil the Bonnet on his Brow: Or on the Ground, all prostrate fling Some Pict, before his barbarous King.— Addison. Mart. Lib. X. Epig. 72. Please not thy self the flatt'ring Croud to hear, Tis fulsom Stuff to feed thy itching Ear. Reject the nauseous Praises of the Times: Give the base Poets back their cobbled Rhimes:— Thyself consider well, that Thou may'st find How much there wants to furnish out thy Mind.— Dryd. Pers. Sat. IV. As hired Mourners, at a Fun'ral, speak, And act, with more Extravagance of Grief, Than those, whose Hearts a real Sorrow know, So flatt'ring Sycophants more Zeal betray, Than real Friends.— Hor. de Art. Poet. True Friends and faithless Flatt'rers differ more, Than a chast Matron and a common Whore.— Creech. Hor. Lib. I. Ep. 18. There's a Sort of People in the World who set up for Wits of the first Rate, and yet have no more Brains than Maggots: Now these are the Men for my Turn: I laugh at them, and at the same Time praise their Parts to the Skies. If they say any Thing, I cry it up too: if they unsay it, I commend them for that too: what they deny, I deny: what they affirm, I affirm: In short, I've brought myself to be of their Mind in every Thing, and by this means I get many a sweet Bit and a sweet Penny.— Eachard. Ter. Eun. Flight. Swift as the Wind, the Daphne's Flight from Apollo. Damsel fled away, Nor did for these alluring Speeches stay.— Stay, Nymph, he cry'd, I follow not a Foe, Thus from a Lyon bounds the trembling Doe: Thus from the Wolf the frighten'd Lamb removes, And, from pursuing Falcons, fearful Doves: All fly their Foes; but Thou fly'st him that loves. Ah! lest some Thorn should pierce thy tender Foot! Or Thou should'st fall in shunning my Pursuit! To sharp uneven Ways thy Steps decline; Abate thy Speed, and I will bate of mine. She heard not half: so furiously she flies: And on her Ear th' imperfect Accent dies. How lovely was she then! the Wind that blew Expos'd her Beauties naked to his View: And, as behind her careless Locks it bore, Flight made her still more charming than before. Now will the God no more Entreaties lose, But urg'd by Love, with all his Force pursues. She urg'd by Fear, her Feet did swiftly move, But he more swiftly, who was urg'd by Love. No Rest he gives, but close behind her bears, Pants on her Neck, and breathes upon her Hairs.— Dryd. alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. I. As trembling Doves from pressing Danger fly, When the fierce Hawk comes sousing from the Sky; And as fierce Hawks the trembling Doves pursue, From him I fled, and after me he flew.— Maynwaring. Ovid. Met. Lib. V. Away she fled: Not Stags with half such Speed, Before the prowling Wolf, scud o'er the Mead: Not Ducks, when they the safer Flood forsake, Pursu'd by Hawks, so swift regain the Lake. As fast he follow'd in the hot Career: Desire the Lover wing'd, the Virgin Fear.— Dryden. Ovid. Met. Lib. XI. Now, with a Lion's Spoils, bespread, Æneas. I take My Sire, a pleasing Burthen, on my Back: Close clinging to my Hand, and pressing nigh, With Steps unequal, trip'd Iülus by. Behind, my dear Creusa took her Way: Thro' ev'ry lonely dark Recess we stray. And I, who late th' embattled Greeks could dare, Their flying Darts, and whole embody'd War, Now take Alarm, while Horrors reign around, At ev'ry Breeze, and start at ev'ry Sound. With fancy'd Fears my busy Thoughts were wild, For my dear Father, and endanger'd Child.— Pitt. Æn. Lib. II. Cheerless, the flying Pompey's Flight from the Battle of Pharsalia. Chief renew'd his Speed, And urg'd, with gory Spurs, his fainting Steed. A thousand Terrors struggling in his Mind, He turns where doubtful Paths obscurely wind. He starts at ev'ry Rustling of the Trees, And fears the Whispers of each murm'ring Breeze: The Fellows of his Flight increase his Dread, While hard behind their trampling Horses tread.— Rowe alter'd. Now to those Shores the hapless Pompey came, Where hoary Peneus rolls his ancient Stream: Red with Emathian Slaughter ran his Flood, And dy'd the Ocean deep in Roman Blood. There a poor Bark, whose Keel could scarcely glide Safe down some River's smooth descending Tide, Receiv'd the mighty Master of the Main, Whose spreading Navies hide the liquid Plain. In this, he braves the Winds and stormy Sea, And to the Lesbian Isle directs his Way.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. VIII. As when the Pilot, from the black'ning Skies, A gath'ring Storm of wintry Rain descries: His Sails unfurl'd, and crowded all with Wind, He strives to leave the threat'ning Cloud behind: Full Speed he fled.— Croxall. Ovid. Met. Lib. VI. Flight Secret. At length arriv'd, with the revolving Night, The chosen Hour appointed for Pompey's Flight from Brundusium, when he was in Danger of being shut up by Cæsar. his Flight: He bids his Friends prevent the Seamen's Roar, And still the deaf'ning Clamours on the Shore: No Trumpets may the Watch by Hours renew, Nor sounding Signals call aboard the Crew. The This points out the Time to be in the Morning before Sun-rise, about the Beginning of September. heav'nly Maid her Course had almost run, And Libra waited on the rising Sun, When, hush'd in Silence deep, they leave the Land: No loud mouth'd Voices call, with hoarse Command, To heave the flooky Anchors from the Sand. Lowly the careful Master's Orders past, To brace the Yards, and rear the lofty Mast: Silent they spread the Sails, the Cables haul, Nor to their Mates for Aid, tumultuous, call. The Chief himself to Fortune breath'd a Pray'r, At length to take him to her kinder Care: That swiftly he might pass the liquid Deep, And lose the Land which she forbad to keep. Hardly the Boon his niggard Fate allow'd, Unwillingly the murm'ring Seas were plow'd: The foamy Furrows roar'd beneath his Prow, And sounding to the Shore alarm'd the Foe. Strait thro' the Town their swift Pursuit they sped, (For wide her Gates the faithless City spread) Along the winding Port they took their Way, And griev'd to find the Fleet had gain'd the Sea.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. II. Flood. See Deluge. — The Po. Eridanus supreme of Floods Rush'd thro' the Forests, tore the lofty Woods, And rolling onward with a sweepy Sway, Bore Houses, Herds, and lab'ring Hinds away.— Dryden. Virg. Georg. I. Thus rapid Floods descending on the Plains, Sweep o'er the yellow Ear, destroy the Pains Of lab'ring Oxen, and the Peasant's Gains: Unroot the Forest Oaks, and bear away Flocks, Folds, and Trees, an undistinguish'd Prey. The Shepherd climbs the Cliff, and hears from far The wasteful Ravage of the watry War.— Id. Virg. Æn. II. —With less rapid Force A foamy River, when th' opposing Dams Are broken down, rolls rushing o'er the Plain, And sweeping whirls the Cattle with their Folds.— Trap. Ibid. —As headlong Rivers flow, Swoln big with falling Show'rs, or melting Snow: And Shrubs and Trees o'erturn, and mighty Beams, And whirl their conquer'd Prey in rapid Streams. No Bridge can check, no Force the Flood controul, It grows more wild, and fierce, and beats the Mole: Ruin and Noise attend where-e'er it flows, It rolls great Stones, and breaks what dares oppose.— Creech. Luc. I. Where Western Skies the utmost Ocean bound, The watry Treasures heap the Welkin round: Thither they croud, and scanted in the Space, Scarce between Heav'n and Earth can find a Place. Condens'd at length the spouting Torrents pour, Earth smokes, and rattles with the gushing Show'r. Then first the cov'ring Snows began to flow From off the Pyrenean's hoary Brow: Huge Hills of Frost, a thousand Ages old, O'er which the Summer Suns had vainly roll'd, Now melting, rush from every Side amain, Swell every Brook, and deluge all the Plain. No Rock, no rising Mountain rears its Head, No single River winds along the Mead, But one vast Lake o'er all the Land is spread. No lofty Grove, no Forest Haunt is found, But in his Den deep lies the Savage drown'd: With headlong Rage, resistless in its Course, The rapid Torrent whirls the snorting Horse: High o'er the Sea the foamy Tresses ride, While backward Tethys turns her yielding Tide.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. IV. Fondness. See Courtship. Love. Oh! had Scylla in Love with Minos. I Wings to glide along the Air, To his dear Tent I'd fly, and settle there: There tell my Quality, confess my Flame, And grant him any Dow'ry that he'd name. All, all I'd give: only my native Land, My dearest Country should excepted stand; For, perish Love, and all expected Joys, E'er with so base a Thought, my Soul complies.— Croxall. Ovid. Met. Lib. VIII. By Charms like thine, which all my Soul have won, Who might not—Ah!—who wou'd not be undone? Pride of thy Age, and Glory of thy Race! Come to these Arms, and melt in this Embrace! The Vows thou never wilt return, receive: And take at least the Love thou wilt not give.— Pope. Ovid. Epist. Saph. Phaon. Brown as I am, an Ethiopian Dame Inspir'd young Perseus with a gen'rous Flame. Turtles and Doves of diff'ring Hues unite, And glossy Jet is pair'd with shining White. If to no Charms Thou wilt thy Heart resign, But such as merit, such as equal thine, By none, alas! by none thou canst be mov'd, Thyself alone must by Thyself be lov'd.— Id. Ibid. Fore-Knowledge. See Fortune-Telling. Great Jove! who dost in Heav'n supremely reign, These direful Omens why dost Thou ordain, And give us Prescience to increase our Pain? Doubly we bear thy dread-inflicting Doom, And feel our Miseries before they come. Whether the great creating Parent Soul, When first from Chaos rude he form'd the Whole, Dispos'd Futurity with certain Hand, And bad the necessary Causes stand: Made One Decree for ever to remain, And bound himself in Fate's eternal Chain: Or whether fickle Fortune leads the Dance, Nothing is fix'd, but all Things come by Chance: Whate'er Thou shalt ordain, Eternal Pow'r! Unknown, and sudden, be the dreadful Hour. Let Mortals to their future Fate be blind, And Hope relieve the miserable Mind.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. II. 'Tis ill: attempt not to foresee What End's ordain'd for You and Me: Never to Fortune-Tellers run, To learn the Fate you cannot shun: Whether more Winters you may taste, Or this Year's Snow descends your last: Ask not the God's Decrees to know, But wisely use what they bestow. From lengthen'd Cares, from fruitless Strife, O snatch this little Blaze of Life! Our Age is posting on to Death, And wastes with ev'ry wasting Breath: Arrest To-day, for Time's a Thief, And lend the Morrow no Belief.— Anon. Hor. Lib. I. Od. 11. Mortals, in vain's your Curiosity, To learn the Hour, and Way that you must dye: 'Twere better Fate should strike a sudden Blow, Than that you long should what you dread foreknow.— Propert. Th' Eternal Being has, in Shades of Night, Conceal'd Futurity from human Sight: And laughs, when he beholds a tim'rous Ass, Tremble at what shall never come to pass!— Hor. Lib. III. Od. 29. Fortitude. See Firmness. Then, on his winged Courser born away, Great Pompey quits the Fight, and yields the Day. Fearless of Danger, still secure and great, His daring Soul supports his lost Estate. Nor groans thy Breast, brave Chief! nor flow thy Tears, But still the same majestic Form appears. An awful Grief sits decent in thy Face, Such as becomes thy Loss, and Rome's Disgrace. Thy Mind, unbroken, keeps her constant Frame, In Greatness and Misfortune still the same. And Fortune, who thy Triumphs once beheld, Sees Thee unchanging leave Pharsalia's Field.— Rowe alt. Lucan. Lib. VII. Fortune. Blind Fortune o'er the World's Affairs presides, And all by Accident, not Council, guides: At random, here or there, her Gifts bestows, And often on the Worst her choicest Favours throws.— Sen. Hyp. III. All human Things are under Fortune's Pow'r: There's no Dependance on the present Hour. Be not secure, tho' high thy Pleasures flow, One Moment more may change them all to Woe.— Ovid. IV. Pont. 3. For, as she pleases, Fortune gives and takes: Beggars of Kings, or Kings of Beggars makes.— Idem. III. Trist. 7. Uncertain whither, Fortune rambles on, Stays in no Place, but hurries to be gone. Now pleas'd, now angry, without Cause is She, And only constant to Inconstancy.— Id. V. Trist. 9. Fortune revere, and her capricious Pow'r, Who often ruins those she rais'd before.— Id. III. Trist. 11. 'Tis Fortune flings the Dice, and as she flings, Of Kings makes Pedants, and of Pedants Kings.— Dryden. Juv. Sat. VII. —How goes the Mob?— They follow Fortune, and the common Cry, Is still against the Rogue condemn'd to die.— Id. Juv. Sat. X. Rare is that Virtue Fortune cannot sway, Which remains fixt, tho' she be fled away.— Ovid. Lib. V. Trist. 15. Good unexpected, Evils unforeseen, Appear by Turns, as Fortune shifts the Scene: Some rais'd aloft, come tumbling down a-main; Then fall so hard, they bound and rise again.— Dryden. Virg. Æn. Lib. XI. Some Fortune raises to an high Degree, To make their Fall the greater.—Most secure An humble Station is, most likely to endure.— Sen. Agam. From Place to Place swift Fortune wings away, And always changing, no where makes a Stay: Monarchs, sometimes, she tumbles Headlong down. And sometimes places Beggars on the Throne.— Aus. Epig. 141. Fortune with malicious Joy, Her Pow'r does wantonly employ: From some she takes, to others flings Honours those uncertain Things: Now on me the Gipsy smiles, Now some other she beguiles. I like her Presence, but if she won't stay, Whate'er she gave e'en let her take away: Wrapt up in my own Virtue, I'm secure, And Honesty espouse; altho' in Rags and poor. Hor. Lib. III. Ode 29. This Passage of HORACE is finely paraphrased by the Duke of Buckingham. Fortune, made up of Toys and Impudence, That common Jade that has not common Sense: But fond of Business, insolently dares Pretend to rule, and spoils the World's Affairs. She, shuffling up and down, her Favours throws On the next met, not minding what she does, Nor why, nor whom she helps or injures, knows. Sometimes she smiles, then like a Fury raves, And seldom truly loves, but Fools or Knaves. Let her love whom she please, I scorn to wooe her: While she stays with me I'll be civil to her: But if she offers once to move her Wings, I'll fling her back all her vain gew-gaw Things, And arm'd with Virtue, will more glorious stand, Then if the Bitch still bow'd at my Command: I'll marry Honesty, tho' e'er so poor, Rather than follow such a dull blind Whore. I liv'd the darling Theme of ev'ry Tongue, The golden Idol of th' adoring Throng: Guarded with Friends, while Fortune's balmy Gales Wanton'd auspicious in my swelling Sails.— Addison. Ovid de Pont. In one continued Stream no Fortune flows, Bad chequers Good, and Joys are mixt with Woes: Inconstancy in every Part appears, Which Wisdom never trusts, and Folly Fears. Thus Years from Years, and (as they roll the Round) Thus Months from Months, and Days from Days are found To differ: no returning Hours restore That sort of Fortune which they brought before.— Creech alter'd. Manil. Lib. III. —Since Fortune all o'erpow'rs, Her let Us follow, and where-e'er she calls, Direct our Course.— Trap. Æn. Lib. V. This Goddess Fortune can baffle an hundred of your learned Men with all their Wisdom: and thus I prove it:— every body is suppos'd to excel, according as Fortune favours him; that's the Standard by which we calculate his Understanding. Now, if his Undertakings succeed well, we cry him up for a shrewd clever Fellow: but if they turn out unluckily, we say, the Man's a Fool. Plaud. Pseud. Fortune-Telling. See Foreknowledge. A gypsy Jewess whispers in your Ear, And begs an Alms: an High-Priest's Daughter She, Vers'd in their Talmud, and Divinity; And prophesies beneath a shady Tree. Farthings, and some small Matters, are her Fees: Yet she interprets all your Dreams for these. Foretells th' Estate, when the rich Unkle dies, And Sweet-hearts in a Pigeon's Intrails spies.— Dryden. Juv. Sat. VI. Full Credit to th' Astrologer is given: What he foretells is deem'd the Voice of Heav'n. From him your Wife enquires the Planet's Will, When the Black Jaundice shall her Mother kill: Her Sister's and her Unkle's End would know: But, first, consults his Art, when You shall go: And, what's the greatest Gift that Heav'n can give, If, after her, th' Adulterer shall live.— Idem. Ibid. But above all, beware how Her You meet, Who in these Studies is herself compleat: By whom a greasy Almanack is born, With often handling, like fat Amber worn: Not now consulting, but consulted, she Of the Twelve Houses, and their Lords, is free. She, if the Scheme a fatal Journey show, Stays safe at Home, but let's her Husband go. If but a Mile she travel out of Town, The Planetary Hour must first be known, And lucky Moment: If her Eye but akes, Or itches, it's Decumbiture she takes. No Nourishment receives in her Disease, But what the Stars, and Ptolemy shall please.— Dryd. alt. Ibid. The poorer Sort who have not much to spare, To Chiromancers' cheaper Art repair, Who clap the pretty Palm to make the Lines more fair. But the rich Matrons who have more to give, Their Answers from the Brachman will receive. Skill'd in the Globe and Sphere, he gravely stands, Points forth the Stars, and measures out the Lands.— Id. Ibid. I value not a Rush your Marsian Augurs: Your Village, Market-hunting Fortune-Tellers; Astrologers, divining Priests of Isis, Or Dream Expounders: for they are not Men Inspir'd by Heav'n, or of superior Knowledge: But superstitious, impudent Pretenders, Vile, lazy Slaves, Madmen, or needy Varlets, Whose counterfeit Predictions spring from Want: And while for Guides to Others they set up, Know not the Way themselves: A Groat they beg Of those to whom they promise Heaps of Gold: One single Groat of all your future Wealth Will them content, the rest they leave to You.— Anon. Ennius. Fountain. Lake. A spring there was, whose silver Waters show, As Chrystal clear, the Bottom fair below: Which neither Man, nor tame, nor savage Beast, Nor wandring Fowls, nor falling Leaves molest. Grown round with Grass by it's kind Moisture fed, And lofty Trees, which yield a constant Shade: So thick, the Sun can never penetrate, Or warm the Waters with it's fiercest Heat.— Ovid. Met. Lib. III. A Fountain here he found, so lovely bright, It shew'd the Bottom in a fairer Light, Nor kept a Sand conceal'd from human Sight. The Stream produc'd nor shiny Ooze, nor Weeds, Nor miry Rushes, nor the spiky Reeds; But dealt enriching Moisture all around, The fruitful Sides with chearful Verdure crown'd, And kept the Spring eternal on the Ground.— Addison. Ovid. Met. Lib. IV. Not far from hence a spreading Lake there lay, And on the shaded Margin tow'ring stood The leafy Shelter of a verdant Wood. The limpid Pool, transparent to the Sight, Did to the Bottom ev'ry Eye admit, And thro' the pure and chrystal Water show The shining Pebbles, and the Sand below.— Hughes alter'd. Claud. Rapt. Pros. A Spring there is, whose silver Waters show, Clear as a Glass, the shining Sands below: A flow'ry Lotos spread it's Arms above, Shades all the Banks, and seems itself a Grove. Eternal Greens the mossy Margin grace, Watch'd by the Sylvan Genius of the Place.— Pope. Ovid. Epist. XXI. Near Enna's Walls a spacious Lake is spread, Fam'd for the sweetly singing Swans it bred: Pergusa is it's Name: And, never more Were heard, or sweeter, on Cayster's Shore. Woods crown the Lake: and Phœbus ne'er invades The tufted Fences, or offends the Shades. Fresh fragant Breezes fan the verdant Bow'rs, And the moist Ground smiles with enamel'd Flow'rs: Which always in their Beauty's Prime appear, For the mild Spring continues all the Year.— Manw. alt. Ovid. Met. Lib. V. I, walking on, a silent Current found, Which gently glided o'er the Gravel-Ground. The chrystal Water was so smooth and clear, That to the Eye each Pebble did appear: So soft it's Motion, one could scarce perceive The running Stream, or that it ran believe. The hoary Willow, and the Poplar made Along it's shelving Bank a grateful Shade.— Id. alter'd. Ibid. Fray. A stag there was, of comely Shape, and tall With branching Horns: whom ravish'd from his Dam The Sons of Tyrrheus nourish'd.— This Beast, accustom'd to their gentle Rule, Their Sister Sylvia with uncommon Care Adorn'd, and with soft Wreaths his Antlers crown'd, And comb'd, and wash'd him in the limpid Stream. He, patient of the Hand, his Master's Board Attended: wander'd in the Woods: at Night, Tho' late, spontaneous to his Home return'd. Him, at a Distance straying, in the Chace, The eager Dogs of young Jülus rous'd: As gliding down the Stream by Chance he swam, And on the grassy Bank allay'd the Heat. Ascanius' self, inflam'd with Thirst of Praise, Levell'd an Arrow from his bended Bow. —The Shaft, with hissing Sound, Driv'n thro' the hollow Flank and Entrails flew. To his lov'd Home the wounded Beast repairs: Bloody, and groaning, enters his known Stall, Like One imploring: and with plaintive Noise Fills all the House. Their Sister Sylvia first, Shrieking with loud Laments, her Bosom beats, And calls the sturdy Peasants to her Aid. They, startled, at the Summons strait appear: One with a Firebrand, with a knotty Stake Another arm'd: whate'er they find at Hand Rage makes a Weapon.— And now Alecto, Fury come from Hell, This Juncture fit for Mischief having gain'd, Ascends the Stall; and on it's Summit sounds The rustick Charge, and thro' the crooked Horn Swells her Tartarean Voice.— Swift to the Sound, where-e'er the shrill Horn gave The direful Signal, snatching up their Arms, From ev'ry Part the hardy Peasants run: And, from their open Tents, the Trojan Youth Pour out their Forces to Ascanius' Aid. They form their Ranks: nor now in rustick Fray With knotty Clubs, or sharpen'd Stakes they fight, But with the two-edg'd Steel: And all around Rises a horrid Crop of Swords unsheath'd: Their Arms against the Sun reflected Shine, And to the Clouds flash back a brighter Ray.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. VII. He said: and running forwards hurl'd a Dart Amidst the Throng of Foes: the well aim'd Ash Flies on direct, and hissing cuts the Air. A thund'ring Shout succeeds: Then all the Ranks Tumultuous take th' Alarm, and burn with Rage. Some draw their Swords, some snatch the missive Steel, And blind rush on: 'Gainst them th' Ausonian Troops, Resisting, croud: To These again oppos'd A Tide of Trojans, by th' Arcadians join'd With painted Arms, and all Agylla's Youth: All with like Ardor fir'd to end the Strife By open War: They hurl the Altars down: An Iron Tempest, and a Storm of Darts Hovers aloft, and blackens all the Sky. The sacred Hearths and Goblets They o'er-turn: Latinus' self, the League now broken, flies, And carries back his disappointed Gods. Some rein their Chariots, or with active Bound Leap on their Steeds, and with drawn Weapons run.— Id. Æn. XII. Within the Palace Walls was heard aloud, The roaring Clamour of the noisy Crowd: Not like the Songs which chearful Friends prepare For nuptial Days, but Sounds that threaten War: And all the Pleasures of this happy Feast, To tumult turn'd, in wild Disorder ceas'd. Thus, when the Seas are calm, we often find A sudden Storm rais'd by some furious Wind.— Maynw. Ovid. Met. Lib. V. To Arms, to Arms they call: A Medly-Flight Of Bowls, and Jars, at first supply the Fight, Once Instruments of Feasts, but now of Fate: Wine animates their Rage, and Arms their Hate.— Dryd. Ovid. Met. Lib. XII. Friendship. See Fidelity. Race. Friendship's fair Name, while Int'rest serves, may stand: Like Draughtsmen guided by the Gamester's Hand. While Fortune serves, thy smiling Friends will stay: But if she turns, they too will haste away. The World's a Comedy: one acts a Lord, This a grave Father, and his Son a third: But soon as e'er the Curtain is let down, All quit these borrow'd Shapes, and take their own.— Petro. Arb. Nature, within the Soul of Man has form'd, Nothing more noble, or more rare than Friendship. Thro' all it's Ages, the whole World pretends To boast but one poor single Pair of Friends: Do but Pylades and Orestes name, And You have all the Instances of Fame. Once Death was strove for; 'twas a gen'rous Strife: Not who should keep, but who should lose a Life Was their Dispute, contending to deny Each other the great Privilege to die. The Surety fear'd his guilty Friend's return; The guilty Friend did his own Absence mourn: And ran to Danger: here they disagreed, One hop'd to free, One fear'd to be so freed.— Creech alt. Manil. Lib. II. To guard the Gate brave Nisus stood in Arms, And by his Side Euryalus: than whom Was none more beauteous, clad in Trojan Arms: The first soft Down of Youth had just begun To bloom upon his Cheeks: One was their Love: One common Hazard in the War they shar'd, And now were both by Choice upon the Guard. Then Nisus: do the Gods, my Friend, infuse This Ardor of the Soul? or make we Gods Of our own strong Desires? My Mind, long since Eager of Action prompts me to engage Or in the Fight, or in some great Attempt: Nor this dull Rest endures.— Struck with Surprize, and fir'd with Thirst of Fame, Thus sudden to his ardent Friend reply'd Euryalus. And wouldst Thou then refuse To add me, Nisus, to the brave Design? And shall I suffer Thee to go expos'd To such a perilous Attempt alone? Here too, here dwells a Soul, that with Contempt Regards this vital Air: and thinks with Life That Fame well bought to which thy Soul aspires. Nisus to this: No such injurious Thought Of Thee, no such Suspicion, in my Breast Was ever harbour'd: No: as this is Truth, So may great Jove, or whate'er God regards These Things with equal Eyes, restore me crown'd With Conquest to thy Arms.—But if some Chance (As many in such hazardous Attempts Thou seest) if any Chance or Power divine Snatch me from Earth: Thee I would leave behind:— Thy Age can shew a better Claim to Life. Let there survive, who may with solemn Rites Inurn my Body, rescu'd from the Foe In Battle, or redeem by Ransom paid: Or (That if Fate forbid) an empty Tomb May build, and grace my Manes with a Grave. Nor to thy wretched Mother let me cause So great a Grief: thy Mother, who, alone Of all the Trojan Dames, for Thee, dear Youth, Follows our Camp.— Then He: Thy empty Reasons urg'd in vain Thou dost alledge: nor is my Purpose chang'd: Haste we, he said: Then wakes the Sentries: They Succeed, and mount the Guard: the friendly Pair, Quitting their Station, seek the General's Tent.— Volscens impatient foams, and burns with Rage: And, with his Sword unsheath'd, advanc'd direct Against Euryalus.—Then Nisus, wild With Terror and Amaze, cries out aloud, Nor longer in the Covert of the Grove Could hide himself, nor such a Sight endure. Me, Me: I did it: on me turn your Steel, Ye Rutuli: 'Twas all my Fraud: He nought Nor could, nor durst: This Heav'n and conscious Stars I call to witness: All his Crime, poor Youth, Was loving his unhappy Friend too well. Thus far he spoke: but driv'n with forceful Swing The Sword had pierc'd Euryalus, and bor'd His snowy Breast: He staggering rolls in Death: The trickling Blood runs down his beauteous Limbs, And on his Shoulder lies his Neck reclin'd. So languishes, and dies a purple Flower, Cut by the pointed Share: So Poppies droop, O'er-charg'd with Rain and hang their sickly Heads. Then Nisus, rushing, darts into the Midst: Volscens alone he seeks, at Volscens drives: The pressing Foes throng round, and bear him back With tilted Spears: He not the less springs on, And whirls his flashing Sword: till in the Mouth, Full opposite, of Volscens clam'ring loud He plung'd it deep, and dying stabb'd his Foe: Then on his breathless Friend his Body flung, And there at last in pleasing Death repos'd.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. IX. No. Fate my vow'd Affection shall divide, From Thee, heroic Youth; be wholly mine: Take full Possession: all my Soul is thine: One Faith, one Fame, one Fate shall both attend, My Life's Companion, and my Bosom Friend: My Peace shall be committed to thy Care, And to thy Conduct, my Concerns in War.— Dryd. Ibid. True Lovers, in their fav'rite charming She, Can find no Faults, or love those Faults they see. Oh! that this Error in our Friendship reign'd, And had the Credit of a Virtue gain'd! As some fond Parent, with a partial Eye, His Darling's Faults beholds, and passes by: So should we treat the Failings of a Friend, And find Excuses, when we can't commend. If the poor Boy is born with squinting Eyes, See, what a pretty Cast! the Father cries: The dwarfish ill-shap'd Thing, that's ever sick, It's Father fondly calls, his little Chick: Or if its bandy Legs by Chance he shows, Smiling he cries, the Boy turns in his Toes. Thus among Friends: One's close,—that Prudence call: Another's vain, and brags,—that's Frankness all: One's proud and haughty,—he'll be no Man's Slave: Another struts and blusters,—He is brave. In my Opinion, this would Friends procure, And knit the Bands of sacred Friendship sure.— Anon. alt. Hor. L.I. Sat. 3. 'Tis common to deceive thro' Friendship's Name; But common tho' it be, 'tis still to blame.— Dryden. Ov. Ar. Am. L.I. With num'rous Friends was I encompass'd round, While favourable Gales my Vessel crown'd: But when the Ocean was tempestuous grown, My shatter'd Bark and I were left alone.— Ovid. de Trist. Fright. See Fear. Just in the Center of the Court, beneath The open Sky a spacious Altar stood: Near it an ancient Lawrel, hanging o'er The sacred Hearth, and cov'ring with its Shade The Household Gods. Here Hecuba and All Her Daughters, like a Flock of trembling Doves Driv'n by a Tempest, vainly round the Shrines Clinging, embrac'd the Statues of the Gods.— Trap. Æn. II. Amaz'd, I shook with Horror and Affright, My Blood all curdled at the dreadful Sight.— Pitt. Æn. III. Confounded, and amaz'd, Æneas stood: Up rose his Hair erect: and to his Mouth His Speech with Horror cleav'd.— Trap. Virg. Æn. IV. Him, while he spoke, a sudden Trembling seiz'd O'er all his Limbs: Fix'd stood his haggard Eyes.— Id. Æn. Lib. VII. —Him unusual Fear Stiff'ning benumbs: Up rose his Hair erect, And to his Mouth his Speech with Horror cleav'd.— Id. Virg. Æn. XII. — Thisbe finding the Body of her beloved Pyramus, who had slain himself upon supposing her killed by a Lion.Her Eyes a Body found, Quiv'ring in Death, and gasping on the Ground. She started back, the Red her Cheeks forsook, And ev'ry Nerve with thrilling Horror shook. So trembles the smooth Surface of the Seas, When brush'd o'er gently with a rising Breeze. But when her View her bleeding Love confess'd, She shriek'd, she tore her Hair, she beat her Breast. She rais'd the Body, and embrac'd it round, And bath'd with Tears unfeign'd the gaping Wound. Eusden. Ovid. Met. Lib. IV. —The good old Woman shook: Her Blood ran cold, and ghastly was her Look: Her hoary Hair upright with Horror stood.— Dryd. alt. Ov. Met. Lib. X. Frost. See Winter. As when the Winter's freezing Breath constrains The Scythian Euxine in her icy Chains: No more the Bosphori their Streams maintain, Nor rushing Ister heaves the languid Main: Hem'd in with Ice, each Keel forgets its Course; Whilst o'er the new made Champian bounds the Horse. Bold roam the Thracians on the chrystal Plains, And print the stable Tide with sounding Wains.— Rowe alt. Lucan. Lib. V. Funerals. Mean time, the Trojan Troops with weeping Eyes, To dead Misenus pay his Obsequies. First, from the Ground a lofty Pile they rear, Of Pitch-Trees, Oaks, and Pines, and unctious Fir: The Fabrick's Front with Cypress Twigs they strew, And stick the Sides with Boughs of baleful Yew. The topmost Part his glitt'ring Arms adorn: Warm Waters, then, in brazen Cauldrons born, Are pour'd to wash his Body, Joint by Joint, And fragrant Oils the stiff'ned Limbs anoint. With Groans and Cries Misenus they deplore: Then on a Bier, with Purple cover'd o'er, The breathless Body, thus bewail'd, they lay, And fire the Pile, their Faces turn'd away: (Such rev'rend Rites their Fathers us'd to pay.) Pure Oyl, and Incense, on the Fire they throw, And Fat of Victims, which his Friends bestow. These Gifts, the greedy Flames to Dust devour, Then, on the living Coals, red Wine they pour: And last, the Relicks by themselves dispose, Which in a brazen Urn the Priests inclose. Old Chorineus compass'd thrice the Crew, And dip'd an Olive Branch in holy Dew, Which thrice he sprinkled round; and thrice aloud Invok'd the Dead, and then dismiss'd the Crowd.— Dryden. Virg. Æn. Lib. VI. —Æneas took his Way, To where the breathless Corps of Pallas lay, By old Acætes watch'd.— All his Attendants, and with them a Crowd Of Trojans stand around: the Trojan Dames (As is their Custom) scatter'd loose their Hair, Moaning. But when below the lofty Roof Æneas enter'd, to the Stars they raise A gen'ral Groan aloud, and beat their Breasts: And all with Shrieks the high Pavilion rings. Weeping a while, he bids them bear away, The cold lamented Coarse: and from his Troops Assembled all, a thousand Men selects, On the last mournful Honours to attend, And with his Father's Tears to join their own: Small Consolation for such mighty Woe, Yet due, in Justice to the helpless Sire. Others a soft light Bier, (with quick Dispatch,) Of oaken Twigs, and twisted Osiers weave, And cover with an Arch of bending Boughs The high-rais'd Bed. There the dear Youth they lay Sublime on verdant Leaves: Like some fair Flow'r, Soft Violet, or languid Hyacinth, Crop'd by a Virgin's Hand: whose beauteous Gloss Still blooms unfaded, tho' the Parent Earth, Moist Nourishment and Strength, no more supplies. Two 'broider'd purple Vests Æneas brings: In one of these he wraps the breathless Youth, (The last sad Honour!) with the Other veils His muffled Hair, devoted to the Flames. Then copious Spoils, the rich Rewards of War, Gain'd in Laurentian Fields, he piles on Heaps, And in long Order bids the Pillage move: Adds Steeds, and Darts, from Foes in Battle won, And Victims, with cramp'd Hands behind them bound, Doom'd with their Blood the Manes to appease, And tinge the fun'ral Fires. The Chiefs themselves, Commanded, bear the Trunks with hostile Arms All cover'd, and with hostile Names inscrib'd. Acætes, with the Load of Age, and Grief, Bending, moves slow, supported on each Side: Now beats his Breast, now tares his wither'd Cheeks, And faint, and prostrate, grovels on the Ground. The Chariots in Procession follow next, Smear'd with Rutulian Blood: Behind them, stripp'd Of his rich Trappings, goes the Warrior Steed, Æthon: and big round Drops roll down his Face. Some bear his Lance, and Helmet: (for the rest Turnus, proud Victor, keeps:) The mourning Troop Succeeds: the Trojan and the Tyrrhene Chiefs, And with inverted Spears, th' Arcadian Train. When all the solemn Pomp had pass'd along, Æneas stood, and thus, deep groaning cry'd: Eternally Farewell, illustrious Prince! Great Pallas! ever honour'd, ever mourn'd: Hail, and Farewell.— —Throning to the Gates Th' Arcadians rush, and by th' accustom'd Rite Snatch fun'ral Torches. In long Order rang'd, A Train of Flames illumines all the Road, And far and wide discriminates the Fields. To meet that sad Procession, slow advance The Trojan Troops, and join their wailing Friends. Them when th' Arcadian Matrons saw arriv'd Within the Walls, with Shrieks and loud Laments, Repeated, all the frantic City rings.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. XI. Funerals of the Slain. —For twelve Days they fix the Truce: Under its holy Sanction, through the Woods The Trojans and the Latins mingled rove In Safety: On the Hills the lofty Ash With Axes sounds; and Pines which reach the Stars They roll from Mountains: nor with Wedges cease Hard Oak, and smelling Cedar to divide, Nor Firs on groaning Waggons to convey. —On the winding Shore, By Prince Æneas and by Tarchon rais'd, The fun'ral Piles stand thick. By ancient Rite All hither bring the Bodies of their Friends, And lay them on the Fires: whose smould'ring Smoke Ascends in Wreaths, and darkens all the Sky. Thrice the tall blazing Piles, and dusky Flames They round encompass: Those on Foot, and These High on their Steeds, all clad in shining Arms: And loud Laments, and piercing Clamours raise. The trickling Tears bedew the Earth below, And down their Armour run: To Heav'n ascend The Trumpet's Clangor, and the Cries of Men. Some fling the Spoils, from slaughter'd Latins torn, Into the Flames: Helmets, and burnish'd Swords, And Reins, and fervid Wheels: Some add to these Gifts better known, which by the Dead themselves Were worn, their Shields, and not successful Darts. Then num'rous Oxen, bristly Swine, and Sheep, Choice Victims, snatch'd from all the Fields around, They sacrifice, and stab them on the Fires. O'er all the Shore they watch their burning Friends, Nor from the smoking Dust can be withdrawn, Till dewy Night inverts the Hemisphere, And spangles o'er the Face of Heav'n with Stars. Nor less, in diff'rent Parts, unnumber'd Piles The wretched Latins build: Some Corps in Earth (And many Those) of their dead Friends they hide: Some to the neighb'ring Coasts, and Towns, they send. The rest, a huge promiscuous Heap of Slain, Unhonour'd, undistinguish'd, they consume: The blazing Fires illumine all the Fields. Now had the third returning Moon dispell'd The dewy Shades of Night: the mingled Bones From the high Ashes, mourning, they collect, And load them with a Mount of smoking Mould.— Trap. Ibid. Pompey, thy Favourite once, O Fortune! now Demands no Heaps of This Detail of what was wanting at Pompey's Funeral, shews in what Manner the Funerals of great Men among the Romans used to be performed. Frankincense to rise, No Eastern Odours to perfume the Skies: No Roman Necks his patriot Coarse to bear: No rev'rend Train of Statues to appear: No pageant Shows his Glories to record, And tell the Triumphs of his conq'ring Sword: No Instruments in plaintive Notes to sound, No Legions sad to march in solemn Round: A Bier, no better than the Vulgar need, A little Wood the kindling Flame to feed, With some poor Hand to tend the homely Fire, Is all great Pompey's Relicks now require.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. VIII. Furies. See Hell. Tissiphone. Two Pests there are, the Diræ call'd: Whom Night At the same Birth with black Megæra bore, Tartarian Fury: with such twisting Spires Of Serpents bound, and added noisy Wings. These at the Throne of Jove and in the Court Of Heav'n's dread Monarch wait, to strike with Fear Unhappy Mortals: When the King of Gods Sits meditating vengeful Death, or Plagues: Or terrifies the guilty World with War.— Trap. Æn. Lib. XII. She from the Sister Diræ's black Abodes, And Shades Nocturnal, fierce Alecto calls, That baleful Fury, who delights in War, In Rage, and Treachery, and noxious Crimes. Ev'n Pluto and her Sisters hate the Fiend: Such horrid Shapes the hellish Monster takes, And teems with such Variety of Snakes.— Id. Æn. Lib. VII. —She to Alecto cries, Thou canst agreeing Brothers rouse to War, Engender Hate in Families, and toss Within their Walls thy Whips, and fun'ral Brands: Thou hast a thousand Forms, a thousand Arts Of Mischief: Ransack all thy fertile Breast: Confound their Measures of concerted Peace: Sow deep the Seeds of Discord: Let the Youth At once desire, demand, and snatch their Arms.— Id. Ibid. Infected with Gorgonian poys'nous Blood, The Fiend to Latium, and the lofty Walls Of King Latinus, swift directs her Flight, And silent at the Queen's Apartment waits. —To Her The Fury from her grisly Tresses flings One of her Snakes, and to her inmost Breast Dispatches him; That, by the Monster urg'd To Madness, all the Court she might embroil. The bloated Serpent, sliding 'twixt her Robes And smooth sleek Bosom, rolls without a Touch, And, unperceiv'd, his vip'rous Breath inspires: Hangs, as a Chain of Gold, about her Neck: As a long twining Fillet, interweaves Her Hair: and slipp'ry wanders o'er her Limbs. While the first Plague, the pois'nous Juice beneath Sliding, invades her Senses, and with Fire Her Vitals blends; nor has as yet the Flame Seiz'd all her Soul, more softly she complains, And with a Mother's wonted Fondness speaks. But when thro' all her Blood the snaky Plague Had spread itself, and her whole Mind possess'd; Then stung, unhappy, by the Monster dire, O'er the vast City, with unbounded Rage, She roves distracted. Like a whirling Top, Urg'd by the twisted Thong, which Boys, intent Upon their Sport, the empty Cloisters round, In a wide Circuit exercise: the Wood, Driv'n by the Scourge, in Spiral Eddies flies: The stripling Throng in Ignorance admires The Spinning Box: the Lashes give it Life. Acted with such Rapidity she runs Thro' the mid City, and the madding Crouds. Ibid. Then, fiercely rolling round her fiery Orbs, Dreadful Alecto on her Hair erect Uprears two Serpents, clangs her sounding Whip, And rapid Thus with hideous Accents speaks. See! from th' Infernal Sisters Seats I come: War in my Hand, and Death I bear.— So saying, to the Youth she hurls a Brand: And Torches smoking with a smouldring Light Fixes beneath his Breast. With Horror rous'd He starts from Sleep: o'er all his Body Sweat Bedews his shudd'ring Limbs: For Arms he raves, Distracted: Arms, upon his Bed, demands, And o'er the Palace: madding with the Love Of Battles, and the barb'rous Rage of War. As when, with mighty Noise, the sputt'ring Flame Of Wood, surrounds the boiling Cauldron's Sides, The dancing Liquor bubbles with the Heat: It's aqueous Fury roars, and smokes within, Exuberant, and foaming: Nor does now The Water's bounding Tide itself contain: The pitchy Vapour flying mounts in Air.— Id. Ibid. Gain. Scarce have I known, in Saturn's ancient Reign, A Man whose Bosom was not pleas'd with Gain. The Love of Gain, which now supreme we see, Strengthen'd by Time is grown to that Degree, O'er All it rules, and scarce can greater be.— Ovid. Lib. I. Fast. In hopes of Gain the Clown with early Toil, His Oxen yokes, and turns the rugged Soil. Aboard the bounding Bark, in search of Gain, The Sailor braves the Dangers of the Main: Nor Winds, nor Rocks, nor tow'ring Waves he fears, But by known Stars his reeling Vessel steers.— Tibul. Lib. I. No Faith, no Honour can the Herd restrain, That follow Camps, and fight for sordid Gain: Like Ruffians brib'd, they ne'er the Cause enquire, That's the just Side, which gives the largest Hire.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. X. Galatea. See Invitation. Fair The Gyant Polyphemus thus addresses his Mistress Galatea, who rejects him with Disdain. Galatea! fairer Thou by far Then the white Leaves of blooming Lillies are: Gay as the flow'ry Meads: as Christal bright: Tall as the Alder's just proportion'd Height: Sportive as Kids: more smooth and polish'd o'er, Than shining Shells, oft wash'd upon the Shore: Pleasing as Winter Suns, or Summer Shade: Glorious as Apples when the Boughs they lade: It's Head less graceful does the Plane uprear: And Ice in Clearness can't with Thee compare: Not Grapes full ripe delight the Taste so much: Less soft new Curds, or Swan's-Down, to the Touch: More charming much Thou art, would'st Thou but stay, Than beauteous Gardens where cool Fountains play. But, Galatea, wild as Bulls unbroke Thou art, and stubborn as an ancient Oak: More changeful than the Waves in thy Intent: Easier than Vines, or Willows, to be bent: More fixt than Rocks; more furious than the Flood: More than a Peacock, when commended, proud: Thistles less sharp, and Fires less raging are: Less cruel 'midst her Cubs the savage Bear: Less fierce a trodden Snake: less deaf the Seas: And, what to me is worse than all of These, Thy Swiftness far outstrips the hunted Hind, The hasty Tempest, or the winged Wind.— Ovid. Met. Lib. XIII. Gaming. What Age so large a Crop of Vices bore, Or when was Avarice extended more? When were the Dice with more Profusion thrown? The well-fill'd Fob not empty'd now alone, But Gamesters for whole Patrimonies play: The Steward brings the Deeds which must convey The lost Estate:—What more than Madness reigns, When one short Sitting many hundreds drains: And not enough is left him to supply Board-Wages, or a Footman's Livery?— Dryden. Juv. Sat. I. 'Tis mere Burlesque, that to our Gen'rals Praise, Their Progeny immortal Statues raise, Yet, (thoughtless of their Ancestors,) delight, To game before their Images all Night: And steal to Bed at the Approach of Day, The Hour when These their Ensigns did display.— Stepny. Juv. Sat. VIII. For he, when the just Gout had lam'd his Hands, A Servant hir'd, (so much he lov'd the Vice,) To take up for him, and to throw the Dice.— Creech. Hor. Lib. II. Sat. 7. By Play our Tempers are unguarded made, And while the Head's intent, the Heart's betray'd: Then base Desire of Gain, then Rage appears, Quarrels and Brawls arise, and anxious Fears: Then Clamours and Revilings reach the Sky, While losing Gamesters all the Gods defy: Then horrid Oaths are utter'd ev'ry Cast: They grieve, and curse, and storm, nay weep at last.— Congreve. Ovid. de Art. III. General. Foremost, on Foot, Cato in his March thro' the Desarts of Lybia. he treads the burning Sand, Bearing his Arms in his own patient Hand: Scorning Another's weary Neck to press, Or in a lazy Chariot loll at Ease: The panting Soldier to his Toil succeeds, Where no Command, but great Example leads. Sparing of Sleep, still for the rest he wakes, And at the Fountain, last, his Thirst he slakes: Whene'er, by Chance, some living Stream is found, He stands, and sees the cooling Draughts go round: Stays till the last and meanest Drudge be past, And till his Slaves have drunk, disdains to taste.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. IX. —Panting with Drought, Amidst the Desart, desolate, and dry, One chanc'd a little trickling Spring to spy: Proud of the Prize, he drain'd the scanty Store, And in his Helmet to the Chieftain bore. Around in Crowds, the thirsty Legions stood, Their Throats and clammy Jaws with Dust bestrew'd, And all with wishful Eyes the liquid Treasure view'd. The gallant Chief the tempting Present took, And, with a Frown, the Giver thus bespoke: Dost Thou then think, of all this Roman Host, That I'm the meanest, and want Virtue most? Am I the first soft Coward that complains: That shrinks, unequal to these glorious Pains? Am I in Ease and Infamy the first?— Rather be thou, Base as thou art, accurs'd, Thou that dar'st drink, when all beside thee thirst. He This is somewhat like the Story of David, 1 Chron. xi. 15. said: and wrathful stretching forth his Hand, Pour'd out the precious Draught upon the Sand. Envy'd by none, while thus to all deny'd, This little Water the whole Host supply'd.— Rowe alter'd. Ibid. Thirsty, for Springs they search the Desart round, And, only one, amidst the Sands, they found. Well stor'd it was, but all Access was barr'd: The Stream ten thousand noxious Serpents guard: Dry Aspicks on the fatal Margin stood, And Dipsa's thirsted in the middle Flood. Back from the Stream the frighted Soldier flies, Tho' parch'd, and languishing for Drink he dies. The Chief beheld, and said, You fear in vain, Vainly from safe and healthy Draughts abstain, My Soldiers, drink, and dread not Death, or Pain. When, urg'd to Rage, their Teeth the Serpents fix, And Venom with our vital Juices mix, The Pest infus'd thro' ev'ry Vein runs round, Infects the Mass, and Death is in the Wound. Harmless and safe, no Poison here they shed: He said: and first the doubtful Draught essay'd. Thro' Lybia's toilsome March, and burning Thirst, 'Twas at this Spring alone he call'd for Water first.— Rowe. Ibid. The Godlike Virtues of their matchless Chief, Inspire new Strength, to bear with ev'ry Grief: All Night with careful Thoughts and watchful Eyes, On the bare Sands expos'd the Hero lies: In ev'ry Place alike, in ev'ry Hour, Dares his ill Fortune, and defies her Pow'r. Unweary'd still, his common Care attends On ev'ry Fate, and chears his dying Friends: With ready Haste at each sad Call he flies, And more than Health, or Life itself, supplies: With Virtue's noblest Precepts arms their Souls, And ev'n their Sorrows like his own controuls: Where-e'er he comes no Signs of Grief are shewn: Grief, an unmanly Weakness, they disown, And scorn to Sigh, or breath one parting Groan.— Id. ibid. Ghost. See Purgatory. —The Ceyx being drowned at Sea, Juno sends the Vision here described, to his Wise Halcyone, to apprize her of his Death. flitting Shade All pale, as Death, despoil'd of his Array, Into his Wife's Apartment takes his Way, And stands before the Bed, at Dawn of Day: Unmov'd his Eyes, and wet his Beard appears; And shedding vain, but seeming real Tears; The briny Water dripping from his Hairs. Then staring on her with a ghastly Look, And hollow Voice, he thus his Wife bespoke. Know'st Thou not me?—not yet?—unhappy Wife! Are then my Features perish'd with my Life? Look once again, and for thy Husband lost, Lo all that's left of him, thy Husband's Ghost! Thy Vows for my Return were all in vain, The stormy South o'ertook Us in the Main, And never shalt Thou see thy living Lord again. Rise, wretched Widow! rise: nor undeplor'd Permit my Soul to pass the Stygian Ford: But rise, prepar'd, in Black, to mourn thy perish'd Lord. Frighted Halcyone with Grief oppress'd, Sigh'd deep, and wept, and sleeping beat her Breast: Stretch'd forth her Arms his Body to embrace, Her clasping Arms find only empty Space. Stay, stay, she cry'd: Ah! whither dost Thou flee? We'll go together wheresoe'er it be. Then round she cast her Eyes, in hopes to view Her vanish'd Lord, and prove the Vision true. Tir'd with the Search, not finding what she seeks, With cruel Blows she pounds her blubber'd Cheeks, And from her beaten Breast the Linnen tare, And cut the golden Caul that bound her Hair. Her Nurse demands the Cause; with louder Cries She prosecutes her Griefs, and thus replies: I saw, I saw him manifest in view, His Voice, his Figure, and his Gestures knew: His Beauty not, as once, divinely fair, But pale, and naked, with wet dropping Hair. I would have strain'd him with a strict Embrace, But thro' my Arms he slip'd, and vanish'd from the Place. These: ev'n just there he stood:—and as she spoke, Where last the Spectre was she cast her Look: Fain would she hope, and gaz'd upon the Ground, To see if any Footsteps might be found.— Dryden alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. XI. He Pygmalion the Brother of Dido, and King of Tyre. with the Sword in Secrecy surpriz'd Sichæus, and before his Altars slew, Impious, and blinded with the Love of Gold, Regardless of his Sister's Love: and long Conceal'd the Fact: and, with Pretences vain Dissembling, mock'd the pining Lover's Hopes. But in a Dream, with Visage wondrous pale, The Ghost of her unbury'd Husband came: The cruel Altars, and his wounded Breast, And all the hidden Villany disclos'd: Warn'd her to fly her Country: and, to aid Her Flight, reveal'd a Treasure hid in Earth, An unknown Mass of Silver and of Gold.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. I. Thus as I search'd impatient o'er the Town, With endless Labour: to my Eyes appear'd Her pensive Ghost, my dear Creüsa's Shade, A Form enlarg'd, and bigger than the Life. Aghast I stood: uprose my Hair erect: And to my Mouth my Speech with Horror cleav'd. At length she spoke, and thus reliev'd my Cares: Why, my dear Lord, do You so far indulge Your restless Toil? Without the Powers divine These Things are not dispos'd.— —Farewell: and love Your Son, our common Care.—Thus having spoke, Me weeping, and a thousand Things to say Desiring, she forsook, and vanish'd swift Into the yielding Air.—I thrice essay'd About her Neck to throw my folding Arms: Thrice, vainly grasp'd at, from their Circle flew Th' unbodied Fantom, light as fleeting Winds, And like a slipp'ry Dream.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. II. —The Night now driving on her sable Car, Possess'd the Pole: When suddenly the Form Of old Anchises seem'd to slide from Heav'n: And from his awful Mouth these Accents fell: My Son, more dear to me than Life, while Life Remain'd.— Hither I come, dispatch'd by Sovereign Jove; —For Me the impious Gloom Of Tartarus accurs'd, and dreary Shades Do not detain: But in th' Elysian Fields, And happy Regions of the Blest I dwell. —But now, adieu: The dewy Night rolls on her middle Course: And with his panting Steeds the rising Sun Severe has breath'd upon me. Thus he said, And flew, like Smoke, into the fleeting Air.— Id. Among the rest, fresh reeking from her Wound, In the vast Grove Phœnician Dido roams: Soon as the Trojan Hero near her stood, And knew her thro' the dusky Shade, as when At the first op'ning of the Month one sees, Or thinks one sees, thro' Clouds the rising Moon: Tears he let fall: and thus with Fondness speaks. Unhappy Dido!— Your Death, alas! I caus'd: but by the Stars, And by the Gods, I swear, by all the Faith Beneath the Earth, if any such there be, Unwillingly, O Queen! I left your Coasts.

She bends her Eyes averse upon the Ground, And by his Speech begun is mov'd no more Than the deaf Rocks, when the loud Billows roar: But whirls away, to shun his hateful Sight, Hid in the Forest and the Shades of Night. Some pious Tears the pitying Hero paid, And follow'd with his Eyes the flitting Shade.— Dryd. alt. Virg. Æn. Lib. VI. The thronging Ghosts stand round on either Side: Some raise a feeble Cry, with trembling Notes: But the weak Voice deceives their gasping Throats. Here Priam's Son, Deiphobus, he found, Whose Face and Limbs were one continu'd Wound: Dishonest, with lopp'd Arms, the Youth appears, Spoil'd of his Nose, and shortned of his Ears. He scarcely knew him, striving to disown His blotted Form, and blushing to be known.— Id. Ibid. —So saying, he bedew'd His Face with flowing Tears: and thrice assay'd About his Neck to throw his folding Arms: Thrice, vainly grasp'd at, from their Circle flew Th' unbody'd Fantom: light as fleeting Winds, And like a slipp'ry Dream.— Trap. Ibid. —Behold, she cries, Again the cruel Fates remand Eurydice. me back: And now Farewell: with Darkness round inclos'd I fleet away, and vainly stretch to Thee (Ah! now no longer thine) These helpless Hands. She said: and from his Sight like Smoke dispers'd Thro' the thin Air, flew diverse: Nor by Him, Grasping at Shades in vain, and thousand Things To say desiring, was e'er after seen. Id. Virg. Georg.

Thy Glory, Trajan, shall for ever live: Not that thy Arms the Tigris mourn'd, o'ercome, And tributary Parthia bow'd to Rome, Not that the Capitol receiv'd thy Train, With Shouts of Triumph for the Daci slain: But for thy Mildness to thy Country shown.— Addison. Claud. 4. Cons. Hon. There Glory sits in all her Pomp and State: Thence Places, Dignities, Preferments flow, And all that Men admire, and wish below: High Honours, Offices, in Suits Success, Right to make Laws, and bid the World have Peace: Thence Scepters, and supreme Command accrue, And Power to give them where Rewards are due.— Creech alt. Manil. Lib. II. Gluttony. See Extravagance. Luxury. Whether it be in little Things or great, Suit thy Expences still to thy Estate; And if thy Purse a Turbot can't afford, Sit down, and be content with humble Cod. For what must be thy miserable End, If Gluttony and Want at once attend, When thy voracious Throat has swallow'd all, Cattle, and Land, Int'rest, and Principal?— Congreve alt. Juv. Sat. XI. Preach as I please, I doubt our curious Men, Will chuse a Pheasant still before a Hen: And yet a Hen is full as good I hold, Except you eat the Feathers green and gold. Of Carps and Mullets why prefer the great, (Tho' cut in Pieces e'er my Lord can eat) Yet for small Turbots such Esteem profess? Because God made these large, the other less.— Pope. Hor. Lib. II. Sat. 2. When the tir'd Glutton labours thro' a Treat, He'll find no Relish in the sweetest Meat, He calls for something bitter, something sour, And the rich Feast concludes extreamly poor: Cheap Eggs, and Herbs, and Olives still we see, Thus much is left of old Simplicity!— The Robin-red-Breast till of late had rest, And Children sacred held a Martin's Nest, Till Becca-ficos sold so dev'lish dear, To one that was, or would have been, a Peer.— Id. Observe how pale, how sickly, ev'ry Guest, Reels from the Surfeit of a sumptuous Feast: The Body overloaded with Excess, Is sunk itself, and does the Mind oppress: Nor can the Soul, altho' of heav'nly Birth, Shake off the Load that fixes it to Earth.— Pope alt. 'Tis yet in vain, I own, to keep a Pother About one Vice, and fall into the other: Between Excess and Famine lies a Mean, Plain, but not sordid: tho' not splendid, clean. He knows to live, who keeps the middle State, And neither leans on this Side, nor on that.— Pope. Ibid. Goats. 'Tis my Direction, that with verdant Leaves Of Arbutus the Goats may be supply'd, And with fresh Springs: And that their Stalls from Winds Be shelter'd, to the Winter Sun oppos'd, And pointing to the South, when now with Cold, And Rain, Aquarius setting, shuts the Year.— These breed more fruitful: These in Milk abound: And ev'n the more they fill the frothing Pails From their press'd Dugs more plenteous Rivers flow. For Food they brouze the Thickets, and the Top Of bleak Lycæus, prickly Thorns in Brakes, And Bushes which high Rocks and Mountains love. Themselves, spontaneous, to their Homes return, Bringing their Young: and, with their strutting Dugs, Laborious, o'er th' opposing Threshold climb. Therefore their Want of Care and Guard to shun The Ills of Life, by thine must be supply'd. From them with all thy Diligence avert The Frost, and Winds, and Snow: With lib'ral Hand Indulge them Food, and leafy Browze: nor shut, While Winter lasts, thy Magazines of Hay.— Trap. Virg. Georg.

Hence Men and Beasts the Breath of Life obtain, And Birds of Air, and Monsters of the Main.— Dryden. Virg. Æn. Lib. VI. For GOD the whole created Mass inspires: Through Heav'n, and Earth, and Ocean's Depth he throws His Influence round, and kindles as he goes. Hence Flocks, and Herds, and Men, and Beasts, and Fowls With Breath are quicken'd, and attract their Souls: Hence take the Forms his Prescience did ordain, And into him, at length, resolve again. No Room is left for Death: they mount the Sky, And to their own congenial Planets fly.— Id. Virg. Georg. Lib. IV. This Frame immense, in which four Parts conspire, Of diff'rent Form, Air, Water, Earth, and Fire, GOD, Power divine, the World's Almighty Soul, By secret Methods rules, and guides the Whole: By unseen Passes he himself conveys Thro' all the Mass, and ev'ry Part obeys.— Creech. Manil. Lib. I. The Face, the Image of the Deity, Can on no Metal represented be: Within the human Soul he likes to dwell, And our own Bosom what he is can tell.— Stat. Theb. Lib. XII.

'Tis necessary that there should be Gods, Nor let us doubt there are:— Before their ancient Altars let's adore, And Incense burn, and Wine devoutly pour. Nor madly think that on celestial Thrones, And half asleep, they loll, like lazy Drones. The Gods are ev'ry where, above, below, Both Heav'n and Earth they fill, and ev'ry Thing they know. Then innocently live: the Pledge restore: Nor dare to violate the Oath you swore: All Fraud detest of whate'er kind it be; And from all Murder let your Hands be free.— Ovid. Art. Lib. I. Has GOD a Place? In Earth, in Seas, in Air, In Heav'n, in Virtue, he will sure appear: Why seek we farther then?— Where-e'er we turn, where-e'er we look, or move, All, all, is Him, and ev'ry where is Jove.— Lucan.

On lofty Thrones twice six Celestials sate, Jove in the midst, and held their grave Debate: Each God by proper Features was exprest, But Jove's majestic Mein excell'd the rest,— Croxall. Ovid. Met. Lib. VI. And now th' Almighty Father of the Gods, Convenes a Council in the blest Abodes. Far in the bright Recesses of the Skies, High o'er the rowling Heav'ns, a Mansion lies: Whence, far below, the Gods at once survey The Realms of rising, and declining Day, And all th' extended Space of Earth, and Air, and Sea. Full in the midst, and on a starry Throne, The Majesty of Heav'n superior shone: Serene he look'd, and gave an aweful Nod, And all the trembling Spheres confess'd the God, At Jove's Assent, the Deities around In solemn State the Consistory crown'd: Next a long Order of inferior Pow'rs Ascend from Hills, and Plains, and shady Bow'rs: Those from whose Urns the rolling Rivers flow, And those that give the wandring Winds to blow. Here all their Rage, and e'en their Murmurs cease, And sacred Silence reigns, and universal Peace. A shining Synod of majestic Gods Gilds with new Luster the divine Abodes, Heav'n seems improv'd with a superior Ray And the bright Arch reflects a double Day. Th' Almighty then his solemn Silence broke, The still Creation listen'd while he spoke, Each sacred Accent bears eternal Weight, And each irrevocable Word is Fate.— Pope. Stat. Theb. Lib. I. Good and Evil Mix'd. Behold the Earth, the gliding Streams, or Flood, Faults are on all Sides, Bad is mixt with Good. Thus barren Seasons midst the best appear, And a small Turn blasts all the blooming Year. A Port turns Shelf, and the inglorious Sand Forfeits that Praise which once its Safety gain'd. Now Streams thro' Plains in smooth Meanders play, Now force thro' Rocks, and roaring roll away.— Creech alter'd. Manil. Lib. IV.

Would'st Thou to Honours and Preferments climb? Be bold in Mischief, dare some mighty Crime, Which Dungeons, Death, or Banishment deserves: For Virtue is but dryly prais'd, and starves. Great Men, to great Crimes, owe their Plate emboss'd, Their Palaces, their Furniture of Cost, And high Commands;—a sneaking Sin is lost.— Dryd. Juv. Sat. I. What had he done, had he beheld, on high Our Prætor seated, in mock Majesty: His Chariot rolling o'er the dusty Place, While with dumb Pride, and a set formal Face, He moves in the dull ceremonial Track, With Jove's embroider'd Coat upon his Back? A Suit of Hangings had not more oppress'd His Shoulders, than that long laborious Vest. A heavy Gewgaw, (call'd a Crown,) that spread About his Temples, drown'd his narrow Head, And would have crush'd it with the massy Freight, But that a sweating Slave sustain'd the Weight: A Slave in the same Chariot seen to ride, To mortify the mighty Madman's Pride. Add now th' Imperial Eagle rais'd on high, With golden Beak, the Mark of Majesty: Trumpets before, and on the Left and Right, A Cavalcade of Nobles, all in white: In their own Nature false and flatt'ring Tribes, But made his Friends, by Places and by Bribes.— Id. Juv. Sat. X. If golden Sconces hang not on the Walls, To light the costly Suppers, and the Balls: If the proud Palace shines not with the State Of burnish'd Bowls, and of reflected Plate: If well-tun'd Harps, nor the more pleasing Sound Of Voices, from the vaulted Roofs rebound: Yet, on the Grass, beneath a Poplar Shade, By the cool Stream, our careless Limbs are laid: With cheaper Pleasures innocently bless'd, When the warm Spring with gawdy Flow'rs is dress'd. Nor will the raging Fever's Fire abate, With golden Canopies and Beds of State: But the poor Patient will as soon be sound, On the hard Mattress, or the Mother-Ground. Then, since our Bodies are not eas'd the more By Birth, or Pow'r, or Fortune's wealthy Store, 'Tis plain these useless Toys of ev'ry kind As little can relieve the lab'ring Mind: Unless we could suppose the dreadful Sight Of marshall'd Legions moving to the Fight, Could, with their Sound and terrible Array, Expel our Fears, and drive the Thoughts of Death away. But, since the Supposition vain appears; Since clinging Cares, and Trains of inbred Fears, Are not with Sounds to be affrighted thence, But in the midst of Pomp pursue the Prince: Not aw'd by Arms, but in the Presence bold, Without Respect to Purple, or to Gold: Why should not we these Pageantries despise, Whose Worth but in our want of Reason lies?— Dryd.

Soon hasty Fame, thro' the sad City bears The mournful Tidings, to the Mother's Ears: An icy Cold benumbs her Limbs: She shakes: Her Cheeks the Blood, her Hand the Web forsakes.

All Day, all Night, in trackless Wilds, alone She pin'd, and taught the list'ning Rocks her Moan. On the bare Earth she lies, her Bosom bare, Loose her Attire, dishevell'd is her Hair.

Ovid. Met. Lib. IV. As when, complaining, in melodious Groans, Sweet Philomel, beneath a Poplar Shade, Mourns her lost Young: which some rough Village Hind Observing, from their Nest, unfledg'd, has stole: She weeps all Night: and, perch'd upon a Bough, With plaintive Notes repeated fills the Grove.— Trap.

No farther Voice her mighty Grief affords, For Sighs come rushing in betwixt her Words, And stop'd her Tongue: but what her Tongue deny'd, Soft Tears, and Groans, and dumb Complaints supply'd— Dryden. Ovid. Met. Lib. XI. —Her Hecuba. big swoln Grief surpass'd The Power of Utterance: She stood aghast: Nor had she Speech, nor Tears, to give Relief: Excess of Woe suppress'd the rising Grief. Stupid as Stone, on Earth she fix'd her Eyes, And then look'd up to Heav'n with wild Surprize: Now she contemplates o'er, with sad Delight, Her Son's pale Visage: then her aking Sight Dwells on his Wounds.— Stanyan. Ovid. Met. Lib. XIII. —Dear Husband, wheresoe'er Thou'rt gone, thro' Hell, if any Hell there be, Or empty Chaos, I will follow Thee: How long my Life's decreed I do not know: If long, I'll punish it for lasting so.— She who could bear to see thy Wounds, and live, New Proofs of Love and fatal Grief shall give: Nor need she fly for Succour to the Sword, The steepy Precipice, or deadly Cord: She from herself shall find her own Relief, And scorn to die of any Death but Grief. So said the Matron, and about her Head Her Veil she draws, her mournful Eyes to shade: Resolv'd to shroud in thickest Shades her Woe, She seeks the Ship's deep darksome Hold below: There lonely left, at leisure to complain, She hugs her Sorrows, and enjoys her Pain: Still with fresh Tears the living Grief would feed, And fondly loves it in her Husband's stead.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. IX. Her flowing Garments mournfully she tares, And rends the Chaplet with her yellow Hairs: Her Tears congeal, her Voice is now no more: And a deep trembling seizes her all o'er— Claud. Rapt. Prof. 3. But The Mother of Phaëton. Clymenè, enrag'd with Grief, laments, And as her Grief inspires, her Passion vents: Wild for her Son, and frantick in her Woes, With Hair dishevell'd round the World she goes, To seek where-e'er his Body might be cast: Till, on the Borders of the Po, at last The Name inscrib'd on the new Tomb appears. The dear dear Name she bathes in flowing Tears, Hangs o'er the Tomb, unable to depart, And hugs the Marble to her throbbing Heart. Her Daughters too lament, and sigh, and mourn, (A fruitless Tribute to their Brother's Urn) And beat their naked Bosoms, and complain, And call aloud for Phaëton in vain: All the long Night their mournful Watch they keep, And all the Day stand round the Tomb and weep.— Addis. Ovid. Met. Lib. II. When first I heard (from whom I hardly knew) That You were fled, and all my Joys with You: Like some sad Statue, speechless, pale, I stood, Grief chill'd my Breast, and stop'd my freezing Blood: No Sigh, to rise, no Tear had Pow'r to flow, Fix'd in a stupid Lethargy of Woe. But when it's Way th' impetuous Passion found, I rend my Tresses, and my Breasts I wound: I rave, then weep, I curse, and then complain, Now swell to Rage, now melt in Tears again. Nor fiercer Pangs distract the mournful Dame, Whose first-born Infant feeds the fun'ral Flame.— Pope. Ovid. Epist. XXI. Trembling she spoke, and raging with Despair, She wounds her Cheeks, and rends her Silver Hair. In copious Streams fast rolls the briny Show'r, As down the Hills the rapid Torrents pour, When Auster with indulgent Softness blows, Dissolves the Frost, and melts the Mountain Snows: Thus in a Flood of Tears her Eyes were drown'd, And from her inmost Breast deep Sighs resound.— Addison jun. Petron. Arb. Grotto. Down in a Vale, of Pine and Cypress made, Extended wide a venerable Shade: The chast Diana's private Haunt, where stood, Full in the Center of the darksome Wood, A spacious Grotto: all around o'er-grown With hoary Moss, and arch'd with Pumice-Stone. From out it's rocky Clefts the Waters flow, And, trickling, swell into a Lake below. Nature had ev'ry where so play'd her Part, That ev'ry where she seem'd to vye with Art. Here the bright Goddess, toil'd and chaff'd with Heat, Was wont to bathe her in the cool Retreat.— Addison. Ovid. Met. Lib. III. Aweful, and tow'ring o'er the Plain, there stood, By Axes ne'er profan'd, an ancient Wood. Amidst of which the mouldring Rocks had made An humble Grot, that Thorns and Brambles shade. Cool chrystal Streams gush plenteous from its Sides, And all around the purling Water glides.— Ibid. The Grot he enter'd: Pumice built the Hall, And Tophi made the Rustic of the Wall: The Floor soft Moss, an humid Carpet spread, And various Shells the chequer'd Roof inlaid.— Vernon. Ovid. Met. Lib. VIII. Guilt. See Conscience Evil. The lovely Calisto, one of Diana's Nymphs, after her Affair with Jupiter. Huntress, rising from the Grass, With down-cast Eyes, and with a blushing Face, By Shame confounded, and by Fear dismay'd, Flew from the Covert of the conscious Shade; And (such the wild Confusion of her Mind,) Had almost left her Bow and Shafts behind. How plainly in the Look doth Guilt appear! Slowly she mov'd, and loiter'd in the Rear: Nor lightly trip'd, nor by the Goddess ran, As once she us'd, the foremost of the Train. Her Cheeks were flush'd, and sullen was her Mein, That sure the Virgin Goddess (had she been Aught but a Virgin) must the Guilt have seen. The Nymphs, 'tis said, perceiv'd it.— Addison alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. II. The wretched Myrrha in love with her own Father, was brought to his Bed in Disguise, by the Contrivance of her old Nurse. Maid rejoyc'd the News to hear, But clog'd with Guilt, her Joy was unsincere: So various, so discordant is the Mind, That in our Will a diff'rent Will we find. Thus far her Courage held, but here forsakes: Her faint Knees knock at every Step she makes. The nearer to her Crime, the more within She feels Remorse and Horror of her Sin: Repents too late her criminal Desire, And wishes, that unknown she could retire.— Dryden. Ovid. Met. Lib.

See Polyphemus's Address to Galatea, pag. 413. me with unrelenting Fire: Forgot his Caverns, and his woolly Care, Assum'd the Softness of a Lover's Air, And comb'd, with Teeth of Rakes, his rugged Hair. Now with a crooked Scythe his Beard he sleeks, And mows the stubborn Stubble of his Cheeks: Now, in the Chrystal Stream he looks, to try His softest Looks, and lay his Fierceness by. His Cruelty and Thirst of Blood are lost, And Ships securely come or leave the Coast.— Dryden. Ovid. Met. Lib. XIII. —He sat; his Flocks, unled, Their Shepherd follow'd, and securely fed. A Pine so burly, and of Length so vast, That sailing Ships requir'd it for a Mast, He weilded for a Staff, his Steps to guide: But laid it by, his Whistle while he try'd: A hundred Reeds, of a prodigious Growth, Scarce made a Pipe proportion'd to his Mouth: Which, when he gave it Wind, the Rocks around, And watry Plains, the dreadful Hiss resound.— Id. Ibid. —My frighted Friends, Unmindful, left Achæmenides. me in the Cyclop's Cave. Dark is th' interior Grot, and vast: the Walls On all Sides furr'd with mouldy Damps, and hung With Clots of ropy Gore, and human Limbs, His dire Repast. Himself of mighty Height, Erects his Head, and stalking strikes the Stars. Dire to the Sight, by no Address, or Speech To be accosted. On the Flesh he feeds Of mortal Men, and swills the vital Blood. Him did I see snatch up with horrid Grasp, As in his Den, and stretch'd at Length he lay, Two of our Number, in each Hand a Man: I saw him, when with huge tempestuous Sway, He dash'd, and broke them on the Groundsil Edge: The Pavement swam in Blood: the Walls around Were spatter'd o'er with Brains. I saw him chew The Gobbets, dropping with black ropy Gore, Still warm with Life, and trembling in his Teeth, As sensible of Pain.— The Giant gorg'd with Flesh, and Wine, and Blood, With Neck reclin'd, lay, snoring in his Den: Belching raw Gobbets from his Maw, o'ercharg'd With purple Wine, and cruddled Gore confus'd, We, having first invok'd the mighty Gods, And taking each his Post allotted, round Inclose him All: and to the single Eye, That in his frowning grisly Forehead glar'd, Wide as a Grecian Shield, or Phœbus' Lamp, A forky Staff we dextrously apply'd: Which, in the spacious Socket turning round, Scoop'd out the big round Jelly from it's Orb:— —Such, and as huge, An hundred Cyclops more these winding Coasts Inhabit round, and o'er the Mountains rove. He scarce had spoke: when on the Mountains Top Himself we saw, th' enormous Polypheme, Shepherd among his Flocks, with Bulk immense Moving along, and seeking the known Shores. An Eyeless Monster, hideous, vast, deform! A Pine's huge Trunk directs his Hand, and firms His Steps: his woolly Sheep attend his Walk. Soon as he reach'd the Ocean's Waves profound, He rins'd his empty Socket from the Blood, Gnashing his Teeth with Groans: then stalk'd along Thro' the mid Ocean, while the topmost Wave Scarce reaches his tall Sides.—We trembling speed our Flight And silent cut the Cords, and sweep the Sea, With struggling Oars: He heard Us in our Course, And with his outstretch'd Arms around him grop'd: But finding Nought within his Reach, He rais'd Such hideous Yells, that all the Ocean shook. Ev'n Italy tho' many a League remote In distant Ecchoes answer'd; Ætna roar'd, Thro' all it's inmost winding Caverns roar'd. Rous'd by the Noise, the whole Cyclopean Race Rush from the Woods, and Mountains, to the Port, And fill the Shore.—We see th' Ætnean Brood (Dreadful Assembly!) stand, and sternly roll Their Eyes in vain, and rear their tow'ring Heads To Heav'n: as when upon a Mountain's Top Aërial Oaks, or Cypress Cones stand high, The Thicket of Diana, or of Jove.— Trap.

Gyant's War. —The Rebel Brethren rise, In desp'rate League combin'd, to storm the Skies: On Pelion, thrice, to heave they all essay'd Ossa, and thrice on Ossa's tow'ring Head To roll Olympus up with all its Shade. Thrice hurl'd th' Omnipotent his Thunder round, And dash'd the pil'd up Mountains to the Ground.— Dryd. Virg. Georg. I. —Ægeon, when with Heav'n he strove, Stood opposite in Arms to mighty Jove: Mov'd all his hundred Hands, provok'd the War, Defy'd the forky Lightning from afar. At fifty Mouths his flaming Breath expires, And Flash for Flash returns, and Fires for Fires: In his Right Hand as many Swords he wields, And takes the Thunder on as many Shields.— Id. Æn. X. Nor in less Danger were the Realms above: To seize the Throne of Jove the Gyants move: Hills pil'd on Hills, on Mountains Mountains lie, And form their mad Approaches to the Sky. Then He, th' Almighty Father, with a Frown, Hurl'd the red Bolt, and smote Olympus down: The Structure totter'd at the mighty Stroke, And Ossa's lofty Top from Pelion broke: They too, who durst attempt to storm the Sky, Struck down, with all their ruin'd Mountains, lie.— Dryd. alt. Ovid. Met. Lib. I. She sings, from Earth's dark Womb how Typhon rose, And struck with mortal Fear his heav'nly Foes.

Jove, (so she sung,) was chang'd into a Ram, From whence the Horns of Lybian Ammon came: Bacchus a Goat, Apollo was a Crow, Phœbe a Cat, the Wife of Jove a Cow, Whose Hue was whiter than the falling Snow. Venus a Fish became, and Mercury Conceal'd within an Ibis' Form did lie.— Maynwaring. Ovid. Met. Lib. V.

Oft, with strong Throws the Monster strives t' abate His Load of Towns, and the vast Mountain's Weight: Then the Earth shakes.— Hughes alter'd. Ibid. Sprung from the Earth, and Heaven's most furious Foes, To storm the Skies when mighty Gyants rose, And proudly sought the Gods that durst oppose: Jove doubted his own Power, as from a-far, He view'd the dreadful Order of the War: When Nature's Frame inverted he beheld, That Earth rose upward, and that All rebell'd: That Hills on Hills up-rais'd their threat'ning Head, And frighted Stars approaching Mountains fled: When impious Armies, at a monstrous Birth, Broke thro' the Bowels of the teeming Earth, Tremendous Race! with disagreeing Forms, Of all that's horrid mixt.— Creech alter'd.

Virtue, that scorns the People's Test, Ne'er ranks among the truly Blest, Phraates fix'd in Cyrus' Throne, Ador'd like Persia's rising Sun: From Cheats of Words, the Crowd she brings, To form a real Estimate of Things: To Him she gives, to Him alone, The Laurel, and the lasting Throne, Whose Eyes can unconcern'd behold, The dazling Heaps of shining Gold. Whose Mind does never Wealth pursue, Nor backward turn to take a second View.— Creech alter'd. Hor. Lib. II. Od. 2. Secure and free from Business of the State, And more secure of what the Vulgar prate, Here I enjoy my private Thoughts: nor care What Rots for Sheep the Southern Winds prepare; Survey the neighb'ring Fields, and not repine, When I behold a larger Crop than mine. To see a Beggar's Brat in Riches flow, Adds not a Wrinkle to my even Brow: Nor envious at the Sight, will I forbear My plenteous Bowl, nor bate my bounteous Cheer.— Dryd. Pers. Sat. VI. Happiness. My Fortune might I form at Will, My Canvas Zephyrs soft should fill With gentle Breath, left ruder Gales Crack the Main-Yard, or burst the Sails. By Winds that temperately blow, The Bark should pass secure and slow: Nor scare me, leaning on her Side, But smoothly cleave th' unruffled Tide.— Addison. Sen. Œdip. You're wrong, my Friend, the Life you guess To be so, is not Happiness. With Gems to see your Fingers shine; On Beds of Tortoise-shell, so fine, Your Limbs to lay; in Down to sink: And out of golden Vessels drink: To loll on Chairs of Tyrian Dye, And feast on rich Variety: To think your Granaries abound, With Harvests reap'd from Lybian Ground: My Friend, you're wrong, if you believe Such Things true Happiness can give. Petronius. But, if the Soul, despising Fear, Can all Events, unruffled, bear: If it is neither vain, nor proud, Nor courts the Favour of the Crowd: If Passion Reason can asswage, Nor ever rises into Rage: Whoe'er attains this happy State, Fortune commands, and smiles at Fate.— Pleasantest Companion, this, This in Life is Happiness: Early an Estate to gain, Left, not purchas'd by your Pain: Grounds that pay the Tiller's Hire: Hearths with ever during Fire: Safe from Law t' enjoy your own: Seldom view the busy Town: Health, with mod'rate Vigour joyn'd: True well grounded Peace of Mind: Friends your Equals in Degree: Prudent plain Simplicity: Easy Converse Mirth afford: Artless-Plenty fill the Board: Temp'rate Joy your Ev'nings bless, Free from Care and from Excess: Short the Night by Sleep be made: Chaste, not cheerless be the Bed: Chuse to be but what you are: Dying neither wish nor fear.— Anon. Mart. X. 47. —None happy should we call, Before his Death, and closing Funeral.— Addison. Ov. Met. III. Harmony. While to his Lyre he tunes his Orpheus, when he went to Hell to seek his Wife Eurydice. vocal Strains, The very bloodless Ghosts Attention keep, And silent, seem compassionate to weep: Ev'n Tantalus, the Flood, unthirsty, views, Nor flies the Stream, nor he the Stream pursues: Ixion's wond'ring Wheel its Whirl suspends, And the voracious Vultur, charm'd, attends: No more the Belides their Toil bemoan, And Sisiphus sits list'ning on his Stone. Then first, 'tis said, by Harmony subdu'd, The Furies felt their Cheeks with Tears bedew'd.— Congreve. Ovid Met. Lib. X. A Hill there was, and on that Hill a Mead, With Verdure thick, but destitute of Shade: Where, now, the Muse's Son no sooner sings, No sooner strikes his sweet resounding Strings, But distant Groves the flying Sounds receive, And list'ning Trees their rooted Stations leave: Themselves transplanting, all around they grow, And various Shades their various Kinds bestow. Here, tall Chaônian Oaks their Branches spread, While weeping Poplars there erect their Head: The tow'ring Esculus here shoots his Leaves, That Spot the Lime-tree, this the Beach receives: Here, brittle Hazels, Lawrels here advance, And there tough Ash, to form the Hero's Lance: Here silver Firs, with knotless Trunks ascend, There, scarlet Oaks beneath their Acorns bend. That Turf admits the hospitable Plane, On this the Maple grows with clouded Grain. Here watry Willows are with Lotus seen, There Tamarisk, and Box for ever green. With twofold Hue here Myrtles grace the Ground, And Laurestines with purple Berries crown'd. Here wanton Ivy's pliant Branches wind; Vines yonder rise, and Elms with Vines entwin'd. Wild Ornus now, the Pitch Tree now takes Root, And Arbutus, adorn'd with blushing Fruit. Then easy bending Palms, the Victor's Prize, And Pines erect with bristly Tops, arise.— Congreve. Thus the sweet Artist in a wondrous Shade Of verdant Trees, which Harmony had made, Encircled sat, with his own Triumphs crown'd, Of list'ning Birds, and savage Beasts around. Again, the trembling Strings he dextrous tries, Again from Discord charmful Sounds arise.— Croxall. Ibid. Sooth'd by his Songs, from Erebus profound Th' unbody'd Fantoms, and thin Spectres rose: Unnumber'd, as the Birds which flock in Woods, Driv'n from the Hills by Ev'ning, or a Storm. Ev'n Death's dread Realms, the deep Recess of Hell, In silent Wonder listen'd to his Song, And with blew curling shakes the Furies wreath'd: Grim Cerb'rus, yawning, his three Mouths repress'd: And with the Wind Ixion's Orb stood still.— Trap. Virg. Georg. Lib. IV. Haven. —Within a hollow Mountain's Side Eaten by Age, there is a spacious Cave: Whither much Sea, driv'n by the Wind, retires, And cuts itself into a crooked Bay: A Station apt for Sailors caught in Storms.— Trap. Virg. Georg. IV. Far in a deep Recess, her jutting Sides An Isle projects, to break the rolling Tides; And forms a Port, where, curling from the Sea, The Waves steal back, and wind into a Bay. On either Side, sublime in Air, arise Two tow'ring Rocks, whose Summits brave the Skies: Low at their Feet, the sleeping Ocean lies. Crown'd with a gloomy Shade of waving Woods, Their aweful Brows hang nodding o'er the Floods. Oppos'd to these a secret Grotto stands, The Haunt of Naids, fram'd by Nature's Hands, Where polish'd Seats appear of living Stone, And limpid Rills, that tinkle as they run. No Cable binds the harrass'd Vessels here, Nor bearded Anchor, for no Storms they fear.— Pitt. Æn. Lib. I. Where from the raging East the Surges flow, The Land, indented, bends an ample Bow: The Port conceal'd within the winding Shore, Dash'd on the fronting Cliffs the Billows roar. Two lofty tow'ring Rocks extended wide, With out-stretch'd Arms embrace the murm'ring Tide.— Id. Æn. Lib. III. Heir. —From thy growing Store Lend thy Assistance, and relieve the Poor. Come, do a noble Act of Charity: A Pittance of thy Land will set him free. Nor tell me that thy frowning Heir will say, 'Tis mine, that Wealth thou squander'st thus away: What is't to thee, if he neglects thy Urn, Or without Spices lets thy Body burn? If Odours to thy Ashes he refuse, Or buys bad Cassia, that's not fit to use? For what hast Thou to fear beyond the Grave?— And thou who gap'st for my Estate, draw near, For I would whisper somewhat in thy Ear. Hear'st thou the News, my Friend? Th' Express is come With laurel'd Letters from the Camp to Rome: Our Emperor salutes the Senate thus: My Arms are on the Rhine victorious, From mourning Altars sweep the Dust away, Cease Fasting, and proclaim a fat thanksgiving Day. Now to the gracious Gods for these high Matters, Know I have vow'd two hundred Gladiators, And mean to crown a Bowl to Cœsar's Health.— Say, would'st Thou hinder me from this Expence? I disinherit, if Thou tak'st Offence. Yet more, a public Largess I design, Of Oil and Pyes to make the People dine. Dost Thou think much of this? speak freely out: Your poor Estate, Thou cry'st, deserves not all this Rout. Well: on my Terms thou wilt not be my Heir?— If Thou car'st little, less shall be my Care. Were none of all my Father's Sisters left, Nay, were I of my Mother's Kin bereft, None by a Mother's or a Grandame's Side, Yet I could soon some other Heir provide.— Dryden. Pers. Sat. VI. What of my Fortune's left wilt Thou receive? Now fairly take it, or as fairly leave: But take it as it is, and ask no more. What when Thou hast embezzled all thy Store? Where's all thy Father left?—'Tis true, I grant, Some I have mortgag'd to supply my Want: The Legacies of Tadius too are flown, All spent, and on the self-same Errand gone. How little then to my poor Share will fall? Little, indeed: but yet that Little's all: Nor tell me in a dying Father's Tone, Be careful still of the main Chance, my Son: Put out the Principal in trusty Hands: Live on the Use: and never dip thy Lands. But, pray what's left for me?—What's left! my Friend: Ask that again, and all the rest I spend. Hell. Is not my Fortune at my own Command? Pour Oyl, and pour it with a plenteous Hand Upon my Sallads, Boy: shall I be fed With sodden Nettles, and a sing'd Sow's Head? 'Tis Holiday: provide me better Cheer: 'Tis Holiday: and shall be round the Year. Shall I my Houshold Gods and Genius cheat, To make him rich, who grudges me my Meat? That he may loll at ease, and pamper'd high, When I am laid, may feed on Giblet Pye? And when his throbbing Lust extends the Vein, Have wherewithal his Whores to entertain? Shall I be starv'd to Skin and Bone, that He A Paunch in Triumph may before him see?— Id. Ibid. When Nature's Wants require, I will be free, Nor care what my bold Heir will think of me: I'll use my little Heap, tho' He be griev'd, Because I leave no more than I receiv'd.— Creech. Hor. Lib. II. Ep. 2. What is my Wealth, if I must always spare? He that lives poor, to leave a wealthy Heir, Is near a-kin to mad. I'll drink, and play, Enjoy my self, and fling my Gold away.— Id. Hor. Lib. I. Ep. 5. Hell. See Elysian-Fields. Just in the Gate, and in the Jaws of Hell, Revengeful Cares and sullen Sorrows dwell: And pale Diseases, and repining Age: Want, Fear, and Famine's unresisted Rage. Here Toils, and Death, and Death's Half-Brother, Sleep, Forms terrible to View, their Centry keep: The anxious Pleasures of a guilty Mind, And just against them deathful War they find, The Furies Iron Beds, and Strife that shakes Her hissing Tresses, and unfolds her Snakes. Full in the midst of this infernal Road, An Elm displays her dusky Arms abroad: The God of Sleep there hides his heavy Head, And empty Dreams on ev'ry Leaf are spread. Of various Forms, unnumber'd Spectres more, Centaurs, and double Shapes, besiege the Door. Before the Passage horrid Hydra stands, And fierce Briareus with his hundred Hands: Gorgons, Geryon with his triple Frame: And vain Chimæra vomits empty Flame. Hence to deep Acheron Æneas and the Sybil. they take their Way, Whose troubled Eddies, thick with Ooze and Clay, Are whirl'd aloft, and in Cocytus lost: There Charon stands, who rules the dreary Coast: A sordid God: down from his hoary Chin A Length of Beard descends, uncomb'd, unclean: His Eyes like hollow Furnaces on Fire: A Girdle, foul with Grease, binds his obscene Attire. He spreads his Canvas: with his Pole he steers And Freights of flitting Ghosts in his thin Bottom bears. He look'd in Years: yet in his Years were seen A youthful Vigour, and autumnal Green. An airy Crowd came rushing where he stood, And fill'd the Margin of the fatal Flood: Husbands, and Wives, Boys, and unmarry'd Maids, And mighty Heroes more majestic Shades, And Youths, intomb'd before their Father's Eyes; With hollow Groans, and Shrieks, and feeble Cries. Thick as the Leaves in Autumn strow the Woods, Or Fowls, by Winter forc'd, forsake the Floods, And wing their hasty Flight to happier Lands: Such, and so thick, the shiv'ring Army stands, And press for Passage with extended Hands. Now these, now those, the surly Boatman bore: The rest he drove to Distance from the Shore. —In his Den they found The triple Porter of the Stygian Sound, Grim Cerberus; who soon began to rear His crested Snakes, and arm'd his bristled Hair. The prudent Sybil had before prepar'd A Sop, in Honey steep'd, to charm the Guard: Which, mix'd with pow'rful Drugs, she cast before His greedy grinning Jaws, just op'd to roar: With three enormous Mouths he gapes: and straight, With hunger press'd, devours the pleasing Bait. Long Draughts of Sleep his monstrous Limbs enslave: He reels, and falling, fills the spacious Cave. The Keeper charm'd, the Chief without Delay, Pass'd on, and took th' irremeable Way. Before the Gates the Cries of Babes new-born, Whom Fate had from their tender Mothers torn, Assault his Ears: then those whom Form of Laws Condemn'd to die, when Traytors judg'd their Cause. Nor want they Lots, nor Judges to review The wrongful Sentence, and award a new. Minos Minos and his Office., the strict Inquisitor, appears: And Lives, and Crimes, with his Assessors, hears. Round, in his Urn, the blended Balls he rolls: Absolves the Just, and dooms the guilty Souls. The next in Place and Punishment are they Who prodigally throw their Souls away. Fools, who repining at their wretched State, And loathing anxious Life, suborn'd their Fate. With late Repentance, now they would retrieve The Bodies they forsook, and wish to live; Their Pains and Poverty desire to bear, To view the Light of Heav'n, and breath the vital Air. But Fate forbids: the Stygian Floods oppose: And, with nine circling Streams, the captive Souls inclose. Not far from thence the mournful Fields appear: So call'd from Lovers that inhabit there. The Souls, whom that unhappy Flame invades, In secret solitude, and Myrtle Shades, Make endless Moan, still pining with Desire: The Pains of Love not e'en with Life expire. Æneas, looking on the left, espy'd A lofty Tow'r, and strong on ev'ry Side With treble Walls; which Phlegethon surrounds, Whose fiery Flood the burning Empire bounds; And, press'd between the Rocks, the bellowing Noise resounds. Wide is the fronting Gate, and rais'd on high, With adamantine Columns threats the Sky: Vain is the Force of Man, and Heav'n's as vain, To crush the Pillars which this Pile sustain. Sublime, on these, a Tow'r of Steel is rear'd, And dire Tisiphone there keeps the Guard, Girt in her sanguine Robe, by Night and Day Observant of the Souls that pass the downward Way. From hence are heard the Groans of Ghosts, the Pains Of sounding Lashes, and of dragging Chains. These are the Realms of unrelenting Fate, And aweful Rhadamanthus rules the State. He hears and judges each committed Crime, Enquires into the Manner, Place, and Time: The conscious Wretch must all his Acts reveal, Loth to confess, unable to conceal, From the first Moment of his vital Breath, To his last Hour of unrepenting Death. Straight, o'er the guilty Ghost, the Fury shakes The sounding Whip, and brandishes her Snakes: And, the pale Sinner, with her Sisters takes. Then of itself, unfolds th' eternal Door: With dreadful Sounds the brazen Hinges roar. You see before the Gate, what stalking Ghost Commands the Guard, what Sentries keep the Post. More formidable Hydra stands within, Whose fifty gaping Mouths, horrific, grin. Here Tartarus, low to the Center lies, And twice as deep as Earth is distant from the Skies. The Rivals of the Gods, the Titan Race, Here, struck with Light'ning, roll within th' unfathom'd Space: Here lie th' Alæan Twins, (I saw them both,) Enormous Bodies of gigantic Growth; Who dar'd in Fight the Thunderer to defy, Affect his Heav'n, and force him from the Sky Salmoneus, suff'ring cruel Pains, I found, For emulating Jove, the rattling Sound Of mimic Thunder, and the glitt'ring Blaze Of pointed Lightning, and it's forky Rays. Thro' Elis and the Grecian Towns he flew, Th' audacious Wretch four fiery Coursers drew: He wav'd a Torch aloft, and, madly vain, Sought Godlike Worship from a servile Train. Ambitious Fool! with horny Hoofs to pass O'er hollow Arches of resounding Brass, To rival Thunder in it's rapid Course, And imitate inimitable Force. But he, Heav'n's King, amidst thick Clouds on high, Bar'd his red Arm, and lanching from the Sky His writhen Bolt, not shaking empty Smoke, Down to the deep Abyss the flaming Felon struck. There Tityus one might see, who took his Birth From Heav'n, his nursing from the foodful Earth. Here, his gigantic Limbs, with large embrace, Stretch o'er nine Acres of infernal Space. A rav'nous Vulture in his open'd Side, Her crooked Beak, and cruel Talons try'd: Still for the growing Liver dig'd his Breast, The growing Liver still supply'd the Feast: Still are his Entrails fruitful to their Pains, Th' immortal Hunger lasts, th' immortal Food remains. Ixion and Pirithous need I name?— High o'er their Heads a mould'ring Rock is plac'd, That promises a Fall, and shakes at ev'ry Blast. They lie below, on golden Beds display'd, And genial Feasts, with regal Pomp are made. The Queen of Furies by their Side is set, And snatches from their Mouths th' untasted Meat: Which, if they touch, her hissing Snakes she rears, Tossing her Torch, and thund'ring in their Ears. Then they, who Brother's juster Claim disown, Expel their Parents, and usurp the Throne, Defraud their Clients, and to Lucre sold, Sit brooding on unprofitable Gold: Who dare not give, and ev'n refuse to lend To their poor Kindred, or a wanting Friend. Vast is the Throng of these: nor less the Train Of lustful Youths, for foul Adult'ry slain. Hosts of Deserters, who their Honour sold, And basely broke their Faith for Bribes of Gold. All these within the Dungeon's Depth remain, Despairing Pardon, and expecting Pain. Some roll a weighty Stone, some laid along And bound with burning Wires, on Spokes of Wheels are hung. To Tyrants others have their Country sold, Imposing foreign Lords, for foreign Gold: Some have old Laws repeal'd, new Statutes made: Not as the People pleas'd, but as they paid. With Incest some their Daughters Beds prophan'd. All dar'd the worst of Ills, and what they dar'd attain'd. Had I an hundred Mouths, an hundred Tongues, And Throats of Brass, inspir'd with Iron Lungs, I could not half those horrid Crimes repeat, Nor half the dreadful Punishments they meet.— Dryden. Virg. Æn. Lib. VI. The Gates of Hell are open Night and Day; Smooth the Descent, and easy is the Way: But to return and view the chearful Skies, In this the Task, the mighty Labour lies. To few great Jupiter imparts this Grace; And those of shining Worth, and heav'nly Race. Betwixt those Regions and our upper Light, Deep Forests, and impenetrable Night, Possess the middle Space: th' infernal Bounds, Cocytus, with it's sable Waves surrounds.— Id. Ibid. Wide, in the Void, extends a standing Lake, Whose miry Banks the Waters of fierce Phlegethon Far-over-flowing burn: with dreadful Roar, Between the glowing Rocks, it's fiery Stream Winds out a Way, Flames bursting out by Fits Thro' Clouds of Smoke. Raging on t'other Side Cocytus rapid Stream, a Stream of Gore! In whirling Eddies, frothing foams away. There too, by which the Gods and Jove himself Vouchsafes to swear, the Styx it's horrid Tide Smoaking with Pitch, and Mud, and Sulphur, rolls. Sad Acheron's most melancholy Stream, Putrid Corruption and rank Poison mixt, Ferments, and from the Bottom, with great Noise, Works up the Icy Sand, whilst to the Lake It sluggishly descends. This Filthiness Three-headed Cerberus delights to drink: Here quaffs Tisiphone, and dire Megæra Here drinks, and thirsts, and drinks, and thirsts again, Nor can the largest Draughts her Rage allay.— Sil. Ital. Lib. XIII. A Band of dreadful Monsters keep around Continual Watch, and ev'ry Passage guard: Wild Lamentation here with horrid Din, Mixt Shrieks and Groans, the Ghosts affrighted scares: Leanness Companion haggard of Disease; Grief fed with Tears; and Paleness void of Blood; Treasons, and Cares, and querulous old Age; Malice, with both Her Hands grasp'd round her Neck, Throttling herself; and Wickedness deform'd; And Want to Evil prone; and Error blind, Stumbling along; and Discord, Earth and Heav'n Delighting to embroil.—Before Hell Gates, Tremendous Guard! his hundred Arms out-stretch'd, Briareus stands, and Sphynx, her Virgin Chaps Besmear'd with Gore, and Scylla, Monster foul! And the fierce Centaurs, and the Giant's Ghosts.— Ibid. When Cerberus gets loose, and scours away Thro' Hell's dark Regions, rattling at his Heels A thousand broken Chains, and roars along, His Viper's Tail lashing his working Sides: Not ev'n Alecto, nor the grim Megæra, All Fury as she is, dares the fell Monster face.— Ibid. —High seated on his Throne, Th' infernal Monarch tries the Ghosts of Kings. Before his dread Tribunal, bound they stand, Repentant, now too late, of all their Crimes. The Furies stalk around, with Punishments Of every Kind and Form.—Oh! how they wish They ne'er had known the Pride of regal Sway! The Ghosts of such as have unjustly suffer'd Upbraid their cruel Reign, and what alive They durst not utter, freely now complain of. Here, one, in Chains, is fasten'd to a Rock: Another up a steepy Mountain heaves A heavy Stone: a third the fierce Megæra Lashes, incessant, with her Viper-Scourge. Such Punishments must cruel Tyrants feel.— Ibid. But impious Souls shall lie in Night profound, Where muddy Waters flow with solemn Sound: Snake-hair'd Tisiphone patroles about, And lashes, here and there, the impious Rout. There Hydra horrid at the Portal waits, And barking Cerb'rus guards the brazen Gates: There Ixion's whirl'd around th' incessant Wheel, For tempting Juno, and intending Ill: There Tityus lies over nine Acres spread, While his black Entrails hungry Vultures feed: There Tantalus remains, for ever dry, His eager Lips surrounding Waters fly: There Danaus' Daughter, impious to profane Great Venus' Rites, are doom'd a fruitless Pain, To fill with Lethe's Streams a Tun in vain.— Dart. Tibul. Lib. I. El. 3. Hero. See General. Warrior. But, by the Head entire, o'ertopping All, Turnus himself with beauteous Form appears, High in the Van, and graceful shines in Arms. His crested Helmet with a triple Plume Tow'ring, sustains Chimæra, from her Jaws Breathing Ætnean Fires; the more the Fight Kindles in Rage, and rolls with Tides of Blood: The more she storms, and burns with baleful Flames. With Horns erected, Io cast in Gold (Illustrious Argument!) his Buckler grac'd, An Heifer now, and all with Hair o'ergrown: Argus her Watch: and Inachus her Sire, Pouring his River from his graven Urn.— Trap. Æn. Lib. VII. Next, Aventinus drives his Chariot round The Latian Plains, with Palms and Lawrels crown'd. Proud of his Steeds, he smokes along the Field: His Father's Hydra fills the ample Shield: A hundred Serpents hiss about the Brims: The Son of Hercules he justly seems, By his broad Shoulders and gigantic Limbs. For Arms his Men long Piles and Jav'lins bore, And Poles with pointed Steel their Foes in Battle gore. Himself on Foot, in savage Pomp appears, A Lion's Hide he like his Father wears: About his Shoulders hangs the shaggy Skin, The Teeth, and gaping Jaws severely grin. All rough, and with Herculean Terror drest, He strides into the Hall, a horrid Guest.— Dryden. Æn. Lib. VII. Pallas himself advances in the Midst, Conspicuous in his Cloak, and painted Arms: As when the Star by Venus most belov'd, Bright Lucifer, just wash'd in Ocean's Waves, Upraises in the Sky his sacred Head, And dissipates the Shades.— Trap. Æn. Lib. VIII. The Evander King of Arcadia. Senior rises: with his homely Coat His Body cloaths; and fastens to his Feet The Tyrrhene Sandals: then th' Arcadian Sword Girds to his Side, and Shoulders: on the Left A Panther's Hide retorts: two trusty Dogs, From the high Gate, attend their Master's Steps.— Id. Ibid. Forthwith new Fire burns sparkling in his Eyes: With dreadful Clank his shining Armour rings: High on his Crest the bloody-colour'd Plumes Tremble: and Lightning flashes from his Shield.— Id. Æn. Lib. IX. Now Turnus, raging, arms him for the Fight; In his Rutulian Corslet clad, and rough With brazen Scales; he sheaths his Legs in Gold, His Head yet bare: then buckles to his Side His faithful Sword: from the high Fort runs down, And shines all o'er in Gold: with martial Pride Exulting, and in Hope prevents the Foe.— Id. Æn. XI. Young Ornitus bestrode a Hunter Steed, Swift for the Chace, and of Apulian Breed: He at a Distance rode, in Arms unknown, O'er his broad Back an Ox's Hide was thrown, His Helm a Wolf's, whose gaping Jaws were spread A Cov'ring for his Cheeks, and grinn'd around his Head. He clench'd within his Hand an iron Prong, And tow'r'd above the rest, conspicuous in the Throng.— Dryd. Ibid. Sacred to Cybele, and once her Priest, Chloreus, by Chance, all bright in Phrygian Arms, At Distance shone, and spurr'd his foaming Steed: The Steed rich Trappings cloth'd, compact with Scales Of Brass, and Gold, like Feathers wrought: Himself Gaudy in Purple, and Barbaric Dye, Shot Lycian Arrows from a Cretan Bow. The sounding Bow which from his Shoulders hung, Glitter'd with Gold: and golden was the Helm That deck'd his priestly Head: His saffron Cloak, And linnen Folds, which rattled, as he mov'd, With yellow Gold He in a Knot confin'd. With Needle Work embroider'd were his Robes, And Asian Cuisses, that his Thighs enclos'd.— Trap. Ibid. A Lion's Hide around his Loins he wore: A well pois'd Jav'lin to the Field he bore Headed with glitt'ring Steel; a pointed Dart, And the best Weapon, an undaunted Heart.— Addison. Ovid. Met. Lib. III. Achilles in his Car had scour'd the Plain, And clear'd the Trojan Ranks.— His white-main'd Steeds, that bow'd beneath the Yoke, He chear'd to Courage, with a gentle Stroke: Then urg'd his fiery Chariot on the Foe, And shook his quiv'ring Lance, in act to throw.— Dryd. Ov. Met. Lib. XII. Homer. The mighty Bard, in lasting Numbers sings, Ilium's long Wars: the King of Fifty Kings: Brave Hector's Brand, the bloody dreadful Field, And Troy secure behind the Hero's Shield. He sings Ulysses, and his wandring Years In Time and Glory equal to his Wars: He sings how twice he conq'ring plow'd the Main, While Scylla roar'd, and Neptune rag'd in vain, And how at home he fix'd his tott'ring Throne, Redeem'd his Honour, and secur'd his Son: Usurping Woers felt his thund'ring Sword, And willing Nations knew their native Lord. His Subjects these: from whose abundant Spring Succeeding Poets draw the Songs they sing: From him they take, from adorn their Themes, And into little Channels cut his Streams: Rich in his Store.— Creech. Manil. Lib. II. Hope. When from this wicked World the Gods withdrew, HOPE stay'd behind, nor hence amongst 'em flew. She cheers the shackl'd Slave that digs the Mine, And cries, Sweet Liberty will soon be thine. Thro' her, tho' wreck'd, where not a Shore he spies, Amidst the Waves his Arms the Sailor plies. Physicians often give the Patient o'er, But Hope still stays, tho' Death be at the Door. Prisoners, condemn'd, in Dungeons hope Reprieve, Nor ev'n on the Cross does Hope the Wretched leave.— Ov. Pont. VII. Death long ago had ta'n my Grief away, But flatt'ring Hope still urges on Delay, And says to Morrow'll bring a better Day. Hope chears the Peasant when he turns the Soil, And promises a Harvest from his Toil. Hope bids the artful Fowler Springes lay, And still assures him of the wish'd-for Prey. The patient Angler stretching out his Reed, Hopes on the cover'd Hook to catch the finny Breed. The Slave in Hopes of Liberty remains, And sings, tho' on his Legs he hears the rattling Chains.— Dart alt. Tib. Lib. II. El. 7. How void of Reason are our Hopes and Fears!— Juv. Sat. X. Horse. —High his Neck, His Head acute, his Belly thin, his Back Fleshy, and round: his Chest with swelling Knots Luxuriant: (best for Colour is the Bay, And dappled: worst the Sorrel, and the White:) Then, if the Clank of distant Arms is heard, He paws, impatient, quickens his sharp Ears, And quivers ev'ry Joint, and snorting curbs The Smoke and Fire which in his Nostrils roll. His full thick Mane on his Right Shoulder plays: A double spinal Bone his Chine divides: His sounding Hoof with solid Horn upturns The crumbling Mould, and rings against the Ground.— Trap. Virg. Georg. Lib. III. First be the Steed accustom'd to behold The Warrior's Arms, and Courage: to endure The Trumpet, and the rumbling Chariot's Noise, And hear the Bridles rattle in the Stalls: Then more and more to love the soothing Sound Of the clap'd Chest, and proudly to rejoyce In the fond Praises of the busy Groom. Thus, when first sever'd from the suckling Dam, Let him be exercis'd, and taught to bear Soft pliant Headstalls: in his weaker Age Yet trembling, nor experienc'd from his Years. But when another Summer to the Third Is added: Let him now begin to wheel In artful Rings: with sounding Hoofs to form His Steps: to manage his alternate Feet Sinuous and flexile: and to paw, and bound With seeming Labour: Then to dare the Winds In Fleetness: and, as if unrein'd, to fly O'er the wide Plain, nor press th' unprinted Sand. A Steed thus train'd, or in the spacious Cirque Will sweat, and labour round the Eleïan Goal, And from his Mouth throw Flakes of bloody Foam: Or more obsequious draw the Belgic Car.— Id. Ibid. First daring Ericthonius to the Car Four Horses join'd, and rode on rapid Wheels: The Lapithæ first, mounting on their Backs, Added the Reins: And taught them, under Arms, Graceful to form the Steps, to wheel, and turn, Insult the Ground, and proudly pace the Plain.— Id. Georg. Lib. III. So, loose with broken Reins, the sprightly Steed Flies from his Stall, and gains the open Field: Or to the Pastures, and the female Herd He bends his Course: or to the wonted Stream, To bathe his Limbs: He neighs, and bounds from Earth, Luxuriant, prancing, with his Chest erect, And Head high toss'd in Air: his waving Mane Flows on his Neck, and o'er his Shoulders plays.— Id. Æn. XI. Hospitality. See Banquet. Munificence. Here Jove with Hermes came: but in Disguise Of mortal Men conceal'd their Deities: One laid aside his Thunder, one his Rod, And many toilsom Steps together trod. For Harbour at a thousand Doors they knock'd: Not one of all the thousand but was lock'd. At last an hospitable Cot they found, Whose humble Roof, not far above the Ground, Was thatch'd with Weeds and Straw together bound. There Baucis and Philemon liv'd, and there, Of equal Years, grown old together, were. From lofty Roofs the Gods repuls'd before, Now, stooping, enter'd thro' the little Door: The Man (their hearty Welcome first express'd,) A common Settle drew for either Guest, Inviting each his weary Limbs to rest. But e'er they sat, officious Baucis lays Two Cushions stuft with Straw, the Seat to raise: Coarse, but the best she had: then rakes the Load Of Ashes from the Hearth, and spreads abroad The living Coals; and, lest they should expire, With Leaves, and Bark, she feeds the feeble Fire: It smoaks: she puffs it with her trembling Breath, Till in a chearful Blaze the Flames burst forth: Brushwood, and Chips she adds, to strengthen these, And over all some Boughs of rotten Trees. The Fire thus form'd, she hangs her little Pot: Then picks, and cuts the Sprouts, her Husband got From his own Ground, a small well water'd Spot. High o'er the Hearth a Chine of Bacon hung: Good old Philemon seiz'd it with a Prong: And from the sooty Raftor drew it down, Then cut a Slice: but scarce enough for one. This in the smoking Pot was plung'd to boil, While they with pleasing Chat the Time beguile. A Beam there was, on which a beechen Pail Hung by the Handle, on a driven Nail: This, fill'd with Water gently warm'd, they set Before their Guests: in this they bath'd their Feet. A Mattress stuff'd with Moss lay on the Bed; Sallow the Feet, the Borders, and the Sted; And of a Piece the homely Coverlid: The Cloaths were old and coarse: yet such as these They us'd alone, at Feasts, on Holidays. The palsy'd Housewife, tucking up her Gown, The Table sets: th' invited Gods lye down. The Trivet Table of a Foot was lame, A Blot which prudent Baucis overcame: Thrusting beneath the limping Leg a Shred, The tott'ring Board she on a Level rear'd: Then rubb'd it o'er with newly gather'd Mint, A wholsome Herb, that breath'd a grateful Scent. First on the Board, Minerva's Gift, were seen The party-colour'd Olives, black, and green: Autumnal Cornels next, in order serv'd, In Lees of Wine well pickled, and preserv'd: Endive, and Radishes, Eggs roasted rare, And Cheese-Curd newly press'd:—all plac'd on earthen Ware. A Pitcher of the same, with Figures wrought, And beechen Bowls, were to the Side-board brought, Varnish'd with Wax they were, and lin'd within.— And now the smoking Mess was serv'd to Board, And with new Wine again the Pitcher stor'd: Then came the second Course, like that before, Plumbs, Apples, Nuts, and of their Winter Store Dry Figs, and Grapes, and wrinkled Dates were set In Canisters, t' enlarge the little Treat: All these a milk white Honey-comb surround, Which, in the midst, the rural Banquet crown'd. But the kind Hosts their Entertainment grace, With hearty Welcome, and an open Face: In all they did, you might discern with Ease, Sincere Good-will, and a Desire to please. Mean time the beechen Bowls went round, and still, Tho' often empty'd, were observ'd to fill: Devotion seiz'd the Pair, to see the Feast With Wine, and of no common Grape, increas'd: And up they held their Hands, and fell to Pray'r, Excusing, as they could, their homely Fare. One single Goose the pious Pair had got, And 'twas the Guardian of their little Cot: This to the Gods they vow'd a Sacrifice, And strove to catch; but swift away it flies, And dodges long, (for their old Age too fast,) Then of the Gods Protection seeks at last. Its Death the Gods forbid: and thus declare;— You're not mistaken, Gods indeed we are. The wicked Race around shall quickly feel Due Punishment: be you secure from Ill; Your Cottage quit, and follow where we lead, And haste away to yonder Mountain's Head, The good old Pair obey:—Slow Steps each takes, Prop'd on their Staves. But when the hilly Height They'd almost gain'd, within an Arrow's Flight, Back to the Place they left they turn their Eyes; Lost in a Lake the floated Level lies: A watry Desart covers all the Plains, Their Cot alone, as in an Isle, remains. Wondring, with weeping Eyes, while they deplore Their Neighbours Fate, and Country now no more: Their little Shed, scarce large enough for two, Seems, from the Ground increas'd, in Height and Bulk to grow. A stately Temple shoots within the Skies: The Crotchets of their Cot in Columns rise: The Pavement polish'd Marble they behold: The Gates with Sculpture grac'd, the Spires and Tiles of Gold. Then thus the Sire of Gods, with Looks serene. Speak thy Desire, Thou only just of Men: And Thou, O Woman, only worthy found To be with such a Man in Marriage bound. Awhile they whisper: then, to Jove address'd, Philemon thus prefers their joint Request: We crave to serve before your sacred Shrine, And offer at your Altars Rites divine: And since not any Action of our Life, Has been polluted with domestick Strife, We beg one Hour of Death: that neither She With Widow's Tears may live to bury me, Nor weeping, I with widow'd Arms may bear, My breathless Baucis to her Sepulcher. The Gods confirm their Suit.— Dryden alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. VIII. —Come on then, gallant Guests, Enter my Palace.— Acquainted with Misfortune, Dido. I have learn'd To pity and to succour the Distress'd. This said, she leads Æneas to her Court, And to the Gods a Festival proclaims. Mean-while to all the Crew, on board his Ships Which lay in Harbour, twenty Bulls she sends: An hundred bristly Boars with spacious Chines: An hundred fatted Lambs, with Ewes: and Wine, Gift of the jolly God. But with proud Pomp the inner Rooms of State Are splendidly adorn'd: and Feasts prepar'd In the mid-Court: the purple Carpets wrought With Art: the Tables groan with massy Plate, And brave Exploits of warlike Ancestors Emboss'd in Gold.— —Uponm the golden Couch, Sumptuous with Tapestry, the Queen had plac'd Herself, and in the Middle chose her Seat. Now Prince Æneas, and the Trojan Youth, Advance; and feast, on crimson Beds repos'd. Th' Attendants wait with Water for the Hands, Distribute Bread from Canisters, and hold Soft Towels. Fifty Handmaids wait within, Dispose the Banquet in long Order rang'd, And burn rich Incense to the Houshold Gods. An hundred Maids besides, as many Youths, Of equal Age, attend: who pile the Boards With Dishes, and the Cups and Goblets place. Nor less the Tyrians crowd the joyful Court, Invited on embroider'd Beds to feast. The Banquet pausing, and the Meat remov'd, Large massy Bowls they place, and crown the Wine. Loud Noise succeeds: and thro' the ample Courts They roll the Sound: in Sconces Tapers hang Lighted from gilded Roofs: and Night retires, O'erpower'd with blazing Flambeaus.—Here the Queen Calls for a Goblet, rough with Gems, and Gold, (Which Belus us'd, and all the Kings from him,) And fills it up with Wine: then thro' the Court Silence commands.—O Jove! (for Thou art said To fix the Laws of Hospitality,) Grant that this Day auspicious may be prov'd To both the Colonies of Tyre and Troy, And by our late Posterity be known. May Bacchus God of Mirth, and Juno kind, Be present here: and You my Tyrians join, Well pleas'd, to celebrate the solemn Feast. This said, she for Libation spills the Wine Upon the Board: and first with gentle Touch Salutes the Cup: which, hast'ning him, she gives To Bitias: He with speed the frothy Bowl Drinks off, and swills himself with the full Gold. Then all the Lords.— —The Tyrians loud acclaim Redouble: and the Trojan Guests concur.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. I. When to the Seat they came, These Gates, he said, Alcides enter'd: Him this Court receiv'd. Dare to scorn Wealth, brave Guest: Presume thy self Worthy to emulate a God: and come Not supercilious to our little State. He said; and underneath his homely Roof Conducts the great Æneas: on spread Leaves, And on a Lybian Bear's rough Hide repos'd.— Id. Virg. Æn. Lib. VIII. Hunger. See Famine. The Morning came, the Night, and Slumbers past, But still the furious Pangs of Erisichthon having prophan'd the Grove of Ceres, and revil'd her Worship, Famine, at her Request, tormented him with an insatiable Hunger. Hunger last: The cank'rous Rage still gnaws with griping Pains, Stings in his Throat, and in his Bowels reigns. Strait he requires, impatient in Demand, Provisions from the Air, the Seas, the Land: But tho' Land, Air, and Sea, Provisions grant, Starves at full Tables, and complains of Want. What to a People might in Dole be paid, Or victual Cities for a long Blockade, Could not one wolfish Appetite asswage: For glutting Nourishment increas'd it's Rage. As Rivers pour'd from ev'ry distant Shore, The Sea insatiate drinks, and thirsts for more: Or as the Fire, which all Materials burns, And wasted Forests into Ashes turns, Grows more voracious as the more it preys, Recruits dilate the Flame, and spread the Blaze: So impious Erisichthon's Hunger raves, Receives Refreshments, and Refreshments craves. Food raises a Desire for Food, and Meat Is but a new Provocative to eat: He grows more empty, as the more supply'd, And endless cramming but extends the Void. Now Riches hoarded by paternal Care Were sunk, the Glutton swallowing up the Heir. Yet the devouring Flame no Stores abate, Nor less his Hunger grew with his Estate. One Daughter left, as left his keen Desire, (A Daughter worthy of a better Sire:) Her too he sold, spent Nature to sustain. At last all Means, as all Provisions, fail'd; For the Disease by Remedies prevail'd: His Muscles with a furious Bite he tore, Gorg'd his own tatter'd Flesh, and gulp'd his Gore: Wounds were his Feast; his Life to Life a Prey: Supporting Nature by it's own Decay.— Vernon. Ovid. Met. Lib. VIII. Hunting. Scarce had Aurora left her orient Bed, And rear'd above the Waves her radiant Head, When pouring thro' the Gates, the Train appear, Massylian Hunters with the steely Spear, Sagacious Hounds, and Toils, and all the Sylvan War. Soon as the Troop amid the Mountains came, And storm'd the Coverts of the savage Game: The Goats flew bounding o'er the craggy Brow, From Rock to Rock, and sought the Fields below, Here the fleet Stags chac'd down the tow'ring Steep, In Clouds of Dust thro' the long Vallies sweep.— Pitt. Æn. Lib. IV. There stood a Forest on a Mountain's Brow, Which over-look'd the shaded Plains below. The Heroes there arriv'd, some spread around The Toils: some sought the Footsteps on the Ground: Some from the Chains the faithful Dogs unbound. Of Action eager, and intent in Thought, The Chiefs an honourable Danger sought. From hence the Boar was rous'd, and sprung amain, Like Light'ning sudden, on the Warrior Train: The Trees before him fall, he shakes the Ground, The Forest echoes to the crackling Sound. His Eye-Balls glare with Fire suffus'd with Blood: His Neck shoots up a thick-set thorny Wood: His bristled Back a Trench impal'd appears, And stands erected, like a Field of Spears: Froth fills his Chaps, he sends a grunting Sound, And part he churns, and part be-foams the Ground: Loud shout the Youth, and Clamours ring around. All stood with their protended Spears prepar'd: With broad Steel Heads the brandish'd Weapons glar'd. The Beast impetuous, with his Tusks aside Deals glancing Wounds; the fearful Dogs divide: All spend their Mouths aloof, but none abide. Echion threw the first, but miss'd his Mark, And stuck his Boar-Spear on a Maple's Bark. Then Jason:—and his Jav'lin seem'd to take, But fail'd thro' over-force, and whiz'd above his Back. Mopsus was next, and e'er he threw address'd To Phœbus, thus: O Patron, help thy Priest! If I adore, and ever have ador'd Thy Pow'r Divine, thy present Aid afford, That I may reach the Beast. The God allow'd His Pray'r, and smiling, gave him what he cou'd: He reach'd the Savage, but no Blood he drew: Dian disarm'd the Jav'lin as it flew. This chaf'd the Boar: his Nostrils Flames expire, And his red Eye-Balls roll with living Fire. Whirl'd from a Sling, or from an Engine thrown Amid the Foes, so flies a mighty Stone As flew the Beast. The left Wing put to Flight, The Chiefs o'er-born, he rushes on the Right. Empalamos and Pelagon he laid In Dust, and would have kill'd, but for their Fellows Aid. Onesimus far'd worse: prepar'd to fly, The fatal Fang drove deep within his Thigh, And cut the Nerves: the Nerves no more sustain The Bulk: the Bulk unprop'd, falls headlong on the Plain. Nestor had fail'd the Fall of Troy to see, But leaning on his Lance, he vaulted on a Tree: Then gathering up his Feet, look'd down with Fear, And thought his monstrous Foe was still too near. Against a Stump his Tusks the Monster grinds, And in the sharpen'd Edge new Vigour finds: Then, trusting to his Arms, young Othrys found, And in his Hip struck deep a crooked Wound. Now Leda's Twins, the future Stars, appear: White were their Habits, white their Horses were: Conspicuous both, and both in Act to throw, Their trembling Lances brandish'd at the Foe: Nor had they miss'd: but he to Thickets fled, Conceal'd from aiming Spears, nor pervious to the Steed. Now lovely Atalanta strain'd her Bow; The well-sped Arrow left the twanging Yew, And to the distant Mark unerring flew. Beneath his Ear the fastned Arrow stood, And from the Wound appear'd the trickling Blood. With both his Hands the proud Ancæus takes, And flourishes his double-biting Ax: Then, forward to his Fate, he fetch'd a Stride Before the rest, and to his Fellows cry'd, Give place, and mark the Diff'rence, if You can, Between a Woman Warrior, and a Man: The Boar is doom'd: nor tho' Diana lend Her Aid, Diana can her Beast defend. Thus boasted He; then stretch'd, on Tiptoe stood, Secure to make his empty Promise good. But the more wary Beast prevents the Blow, And upward rips the Groin of his audacious Foe. Ancæus falls: His Bowels from the Wound Rush out, and clotted Blood distains the Ground. Two Spears from Meleager's Hand were sent, With equal Force, but various in th' Event: The first was fixt in Earth, the second stood On the Boars bristled Back, and deeply drank his Blood. Now while the tortur'd Savage turns around, And flings about his Foam, impatient of the Wound, The Wound's great Author close at Hand provokes His Rage, and plies him with redoubled Strokes: Wheels, as he Wheels: and with his pointed Dart Explores the nearest Passage to his Heart. Quick, and more quick he spins in giddy Gires, Then falls, and in much Foam his Soul expires. This Act, with Shouts Heav'n-high the friendly Band Applaud, and strain in their's the Victor's Hand. Then All approach the Slain with vast Surprize: Admire on what a Breadth of Earth he lies: And scarce secure, reach out their Spears afar, And blood their Points, to prove their Partnership of War.— Dryden. Ovid. Met. Lib. VIII. Hunting the Hare. As when a Hare the nimble Greyhound spies, His Feet for Prey, she her's for Safety plies: And now he strains, and now he forward bends, Now to her Heels his lengthned Snout extends: So near he bears, and hovers over the Prize, He seems to seize her ev'ry Step she flies: While she scarce knowing if She's caught or no, Springs from his Mouth, and mocks the seizing Foe.— Sewell. Ovid. Met. Lib. I. Huntress. See Amazon. She, Huntress like, had on her Shoulders hung A light commodious Bow; and giv'n the Winds To wanton in her Tresses: bare her Knee: And in a Knot her flowing Folds confin'd.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. I. The Nymph nor spun, nor dress'd with artful Pride: Her Vest was gather'd up, her Hair was ty'd: Now in her Hand a slender Spear she bore, Now a light Quiver on her Shoulders wore: To chast Diana from her Youth inclin'd, The sprightly Warriors of the Wood she join'd.— Addison. Ovid. Met. Lib. II. —Fair Atalanta came, Grace of the Woods: a Diamond Buckle bound Her Vest behind, that else had flow'd upon the Ground. A single Knot her lovely Locks confin'd: The Ends, uncurl'd, lay open to the Wind. An Iv'ry Quiver, o'er her Shoulders flung, Contain'd her Darts, which rattled as it hung. In her left Hand a curious Bow she held, And, thus array'd, she issu'd to the Field. Such was her Face, as in a Nymph display'd A fair fierce Boy, or in a Boy betray'd The blushing Beauties of a modest Maid.— Dryd. alt. Ovid. Met. Lib. VIII. Her Arms were naked to th' admiring Eye, And in the Wind her comely Tresses fly: A furnish'd Quiver on her Shoulder hung, A Bow was in her Hand, but now unstrung: Her Cretan Vest, short gather'd from the Ground, A double Girdle regularly bound.— Hughes. Claud. Rapt. Prof. Hypocrisy. See Dissimulation. Looks. I'm sick of Rome, and wish myself convey'd Where freezing Seas obstruct the Merchant's Trade: When Hypocrites read Lectures, and a Sot, Because into a Preaching-Habit got, Tho' surfeit-gorg'd, and reeking from the Stews, Nothing but Abstinence for's Theme will chuse. The Creatures too pretend to Learning:—Why? Chrysippus' Statue decks their Library. Who makes his Closet finest, is most read: The Dolt that with an Aristotle's Head, Carv'd to the Life, has once adorn'd his Shelf, Streight sets up for a Stagyrite himself.— Tate. Juv. Sat. II. Jealousy. When Telephus his youthful Charms, His rosy Neck, and winding Arms, With endless Rapture you recite, And in that pleasing Name delight: My Heart, inflam'd by jealous Heats, With numberless Resentments beats: From my pale Cheek the Colour flies, And all the Man within me dies. By Fits my swelling Grief appears In rising Sighs, and falling Tears, That shew too well the warm Desires, The silent, slow, consuming Fires, Which on my inmost Vitals prey, And melt my very Soul away.— Addison. Hor. Lib. I. Ode 13. Her Love believes the Tale: the Truth Dejanira Wife of Hercules, jealous of the fair Iole. she fears Of his new Passion, and gives Way to Tears: But soon, she cries, Oh! wherefore do I so? The Harlot will but triumph in my Woe. My raging Wrongs now urge me to pursue Some desp'rate Deed, by which the World shall view How far Revenge and Woman's Rage can rise, When weltring in her Blood the Harlot dies.— Gay alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. IX. Now my Cephelus suspecting the Virtue of his Wife Procris, came in Disguise to tempt her. fond Heart with jealous Torments bled, For fear my Wife had wrong'd her nuptial Bed: Much I distrust her Charms and blooming Years, But then her Virtue checks my rising Fears. Yet I was absent long; Experience too Taught me how far a Woman could be true. Each doubtful Circumstance Suspicion bred, For Lovers Sceptics are, and all Things dread. I try to seek what I should grieve to find, Resolve to bribe her, and with Presents blind.— Gay alt. Ovid. Met. Lib. VII. Great Love is soonest with Suspicion fir'd; She swoon'd, and with the Procris being told of her Husband's Regard for Aura. Tale almost expir'd. Senseless some time she lay, then thus began: Ah, hapless Woman I! Ah faithless Man!— Transported with imaginary Blame, She fears a Nothing, a mere empty Name: But grieves as much, and is as jealous too, As if the Crime were real, the Rival true. Yet oft she doubts, and hopes she is deceiv'd, And scarce forgives herself that she believ'd: Resolves to see, and to suspend her Blame, Till her own Eyes convince her of the Shame.— Sewell and Gay alt. Ibid. No furious Boar, whom Rage and Anger fire, To rend the Dogs in his revengeful Ire: No Lioness, whose Whelps receive the Breast, No Viper, by unwary Footsteps prest: Can equal Woman's Rage, by Fury led, To find a Rival in her injur'd Bed.— Dryden alter'd. Ov. Art. Am. Lib. II. Soon as the Name of Aura Procris hears, With Jealousy surpriz'd, and fainting Fears, Her rosy Colour fled her lovely Face, And Agonies like Death supply'd the Place: Pale she appear'd, as are the falling Leaves, When first the Vine the Winter Blast receives. Of ripen'd Quinces such the yellow Hue, Or, when unripe, we Cornel-Berries view. Reviving from her Swoon, her Robes she tore: Nor her own faultless Face to wound forbore.— Congreve. Ibid. Imprecation. For him, ye Gods! for Crastinus, whose Spear With impious Eagerness began the War, Some more than common Punishment prepare: Beyond the Grave long lasting Plagues ordain, Surviving Sense, and never-ceasing Pain.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. VII. —For Crimes like These, So bold, and monstrous, may the righteous Gods (If Heav'n has any Justice, that regards Such Outrages) reward Thee, as thy Deeds Deserve! who thus hast forc'd Priam. me to behold The Murder of my Son, and with his Blood, Barbarian! could'st pollute a Father's Sight.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. II. Thou Sun! who view'st at once the World below! Thou Juno! Guardian of the nuptial Vow! Thou Hecate! hearken from the dark Abodes: Ye Furies! Fiends! and violated Gods! All Powers invok'd with Dido's dying Breath, Attend her Curses, and avenge her Death. If so the Fates ordain, and Jove Commands Th' ungrateful Æneas. Wretch should find the Latian Lands: Yet let a Race untam'd, and haughty Foes, His peaceful Entrance with dire Arms oppose: Oppress'd with Numbers in th' unequal Field, His Men discourag'd, and himself expell'd, Let him for Succour sue from Place to Place, Torn from his Subjects, and his Son's Embrace. First let him see his Friends in Battle slain, And their untimely Fate lament in vain: And when, at length, the cruel War shall cease, On hard Conditions may he buy his Peace. Nor let him then enjoy supreme Command, But fall, untimely, by some hostile Hand: And lye unbury'd on the barren Sand. These are my Pray'rs, and this my dying Will, And you, my Tyrians, every Curse fulfil: Perpetual Hate, and mortal Wars proclaim, Against the Prince, the People, and the Name: These grateful Off'rings on my Grave bestow, Nor League, nor Love, the hostile Nations know: Now, and from hence, in every future Age, When Rage excites your Arms, and Strength supplies the Rage: Rise some Avenger of our Lybian Blood, With Fire and Sword pursue the perjur'd Brood: Our Arms, our Seas, our Shores oppos'd to theirs, And the same Hate descend on all our Heirs.— Dryden. Virg. Æn. Lib. IV. — Tisiphone! Oh hear, and aid the Vengeance OEdipus. I require, If worthy Thee, and what Thou might'st inspire! My Sons their old unhappy Sire despise, Spoil'd of his Kingdom, and depriv'd of Eyes: Guideless, I wander, unregarded mourn, While these exalt their Scepters o'er my Urn: These Sons, ye Gods! who with flagitious Pride, Insult my Darkness, and my Groans deride. Art thou a Father, unregarding Jove! And sleeps thy Thunder in the Realms above? Thou Fury then, some lasting Curse entail, Which o'er their Children's Children shall prevail: Place on their Heads that Crown distain'd with Gore, Which these dire Hands from my slain Father tore: Go, and a Parent's heavy Curses bear: Break all the Bonds of Nature, and prepare Their kindred Souls to mutual Hate and War! Give them to dare, what I might wish to see, Blind as I am, some glorious Villany!— Pope. Stat. Theb. Lib. I.

Tibul. Lib. I. El. 6. Inclinations of Men Different. Men diff'rent Things admire and approve: Odes You like best; Iambics Others love: Whilst a third Sort in Satyr's Rage delight: Sharp Salt alone can please their Appetite. Three Friends by me are sent for to a Feast, A diff'rent Palate too has ev'ry Guest. What shall, what shall I not provide? when You For what They like a strong Aversion shew; And chuse what's hateful to the other two.— Hor. Lib. II. Epist. 2. Pollux on Foot, on Horseback Castor fights: As many Men, so many their Delights.— Creech. Hor. Creech. Lib. II. Sat 1. Who's Temper's serious, and their Humour sad, They think all blithe and merry Men are mad: They who are merry, and whose Humour's free, Abhor a sad and serious Gravity: They who are slow and heavy, can't admit The Friendship of a quick and ready Wit. The slothful hate the busy active Men, And are detested by the same again. They whose free Humour prompts them to be gay, To drink all Night and revel all the Day, Abhor the Man that can his Cups refuse.— Pooly. Hor. Lib. I. Epist 18. Nature is ever various in her Frame: Each has a diff'rent Will, and few the same. The greedy Merchants, led by Lucre, run To the parch'd Indies, and the rising Sun: From thence hot Pepper, and rich Drugs they bear, Bart'ring for Spices their Italian Ware. The lazy Glutton safe at Home will keep, Indulge his Sloth, and batten with his Sleep. One bribes for high Preferment in the State, A second shakes the Box, and sits up late: Another shakes the Bed, dissolving there, Till Knots upon his gouty Joints appear, And Chalk is in his crippled Fingers found: Rots like a doddard Oak, and peice-meal falls to Ground. Then, his lewd Follies he would late repent; And his past Years, that in a Mist were spent.— Dryden. Pers. Sat. V. For Men of diff'rent Inclinations are; Tho' born, perhaps, beneath one common Star. In Mind and Manners Twins oppos'd we see In the same Sign, almost the same Degree. One, frugal, on his Birth-Day fears to dine, Does at a Penny's Cost in Herbs repine, And hardly dares to dip his Fingers in the Brine: Prepar'd as Priest of his own Rites to stand, He sprinkles Pepper with a sparing Hand. His jolly Brother opposite in Sense, Laughs at his Thrift: and lavish of Expence, Quaffs, crams, and guttles, in his own Defence.— Dryd. Pers. Sat. VI. Some view, with a delighted Eye, Thick Clouds of Dust around them fly, While their contending Chariots roll, And nicely shun th' Olympic Goal: Where Races, won, and Palms bestow'd, Exalt a Hero to a God. This is of high Preferment proud, And Honours given by the Crowd: That plows his own paternal Fields, With what the Lybian Harvest yields Content: nor by the Hopes of Gain Can'st Thou e'er tempt him from the Plain: Or draw his fearful Soul to ride In feeble Ships, and stem the Tide. The Merchant toss'd on angry Seas, Commends his Farm, and rural Ease: Yet rigs his shatter'd Bark once more, Untaught, unable to be poor. There are who quaff, (or careless laid Beneath the wilding-Apple's Shade, Or where the rising Fountains play,) Old Massic Wine throughout the Day. And Many be, whom Camps delight, And Battles, that fond Mothers fright: Who in the Fife's, and Clarion's Voice, The Symphony of War, rejoyce. The Hunter bears bleak Cold and Wet, Unmindful of his lovely Spouse: Whether the Stag the Beagles rouse, Or the wild Boar has broke the Net.— Creech. Welsted alt. Hor. Lib. I. Od. 1. Some vex the Deep with Oars, and rush to Arms: Sollicit Favour in the Courts of Kings. One Spoils, from wretched, ruin'd Cities seeks: To quaff on Gems, and snore on Tyrian Dye: This buries Wealth, and broods o'er hoarded Gold: That doats with Fondness on the Rostrum's Fame: Another on th' Applauses of the Cirque, And Theaters: for doubled is th' Applause: The People and the Fathers both concur: He, set agape, stands ravish'd at the Sound. Some triumph, reeking in their Brother's Blood: And change for Exile their sweet native Homes, And seek a Soil warm'd by another Sun.— Trap. Virg. Georg. Lib. II. The savage Lioness pursues the Wolf: The Wolf the Goat: the Goat the Trefoil's Flowers: Thee, Corydon, Alexis: All their Love.— Id. Virg. Ecl. II.

Grateful is Dew to springing Corn: sweet Brouze To new-wean'd Kids: the bending Sallow's Leaves To pregnant Yews: Amyntas sole to Me.— Id. Virg. Ecl. III. Inconstancy. This fickle Wretch ne'er holds in the same Mind: Sometimes his hasty Steps outstrip the Wind, As if he fear'd some Enemy behind: Now, with slow Pace he apes the solemn Priest, Who in Procession walks to Juno's Feast: His Equipage, now, counts two hundred Men, And, now, the Number is reduc'd to ten: Now, with grand Airs his Conversation rings, Of nothing less than Governors and Kings: Now, a clean Salt-Cellar is all his Wish, And a small Table for one homely Dish; And as to Cloths, however coarse and old, They're good enough, if they keep out the Cold.— Anon. Hor. Lib. I. Sat. 3. What he was fond of, now he does reject, And seeks what he but lately did neglect: He wavers still, and flies from that to this, And all his Life a Contradiction is.— Creech.

Night now was sliding in her middle Course: The first Repose was finish'd: When the Dame, Who by her Distaff's slender Art subsists, Wakes the spread Embers, and the sleeping Fire, Night adding to her Work: and calls her Maids To their long Tasks, by lighted Tapers urg'd: Thus spotless to preserve her Husband's Bed, And educate her little prattling Babes.— Trap. Æn. VIII. Infant. Like some poor Sailor by the Tempest hurl'd Ashore, the Babe is shipwreck'd on the World: Naked he lies, and ready to expire, Helpless of all that human Wants require: Expos'd upon th' unhospitable Earth, From the first Moment of his hapless Birth: Straight with foreboding Cries he fills the Room, Too sure Presages of his future Doom. But Flocks, and Herds, and ev'ry savage Beast, By more indulgent Nature are increas'd: They want no Rattles for their froward Mood, No Nurse to reconcile them to their Food, With broken Words: nor Winter Blasts they fear, Nor change their Habits with the changing Year: Nor for their Safety Citadels prepare, Nor forge the wicked Instruments of War. Unlabour'd Earth her bounteous Treasure grants, And Nature's lavish Hands supply their common Wants.— Dryden. Lucret. Lib.

What Race of Men Is This? What barb'rous Country, that permits Such Customs? From the Refuge of the Strand They drive us, offer War, and beat us back From the first Shore.— Trap. Æn. Lib. I. —By Degrees I swam to Land: and now had safe arriv'd: Had not the cruel Nation, as I catch'd With grasping Hands the Mountain's rugged Sides, Clogg'd in my brine-drench'd Garments, with the This inhuman Practice is too frequent on our own Coasts. Sword Invaded me, and ignorant suppos'd They gain'd a Prize.— Id. Æn. Lib. VI. Intreaty. See Dissuasion. Request (Dying.) —By Heav'n, By all the Gods, who witness to the Truth, By all that Faith, (if any such there be,) Which yet remains untainted in the World, You suppliant I implore: commiserate Such mighty Woes, commiserate a Wretch Not meriting the Afflictions he endures.— Trap. Æn. Lib. II. Why does Æneas. he stop his unrelenting Ears To my Intreaties? Whither does he fly So hasty? this last Favour let him grant To his unhappy Lover: let him wait An easy Voyage, and permitting Winds. Dido.I now no more petition him to yield The Rights of Nuptials, which he has betray'd: Nor urge him to relinquish his gay Hopes Of Italy and Empire:—All I beg Is but a soothing Interval, some Rest, And Respite to my Passion: 'till my Fate Shall to Misfortune reconcile my Soul, Subdu'd by Grief, and teach me how to mourn. This let him grant: I'll then dismiss him free, And crown his Satisfaction with my Death.— Id. Æn. Lib. IV. Trembling, he clasp'd the Hero's Knees, and pray'd: By young Iülus, by thy Father's Shade, O spare my Life, and send me back to see My longing Sire, and tender Progeny. A lofty House I have, and Wealth untold, In Silver Ingots, and in Bars of Gold: All these, and Sums besides, which see no Day, The Ransom of this one poor Life shall pay. If I survive, shall Troy the less prevail? A single Soul's too light to turn the Scale.— Dryden. Virg. Æn. Lib. X. Invitation. Come hither, beauteous Boy! behold; the Nymphs To Thee fresh Lillies in full Baskets bring: For Thee the lovely Naïs crops the Heads Of Poppies, and the Violet's pale Flow'rs, With the Narcissus and sweet Anise join'd: Then mingling Cinamon, and other Herbs Of fragrant Scent, with the soft Hyacinth The Saffron Bloom of Marigolds adorns.— Virg. Ecl. II. Dear Galatea! sweeter far to me Than Hybla's Thyme to the laborious Bee: Whiter than Swans that swim the Chrystal Streams, And fairer than the shining Ivy seems: Come, when the Bulls shall to their Stalls repair: Ah! come, if Corydon's at all thy Care.— Virg. Ecl. VII. Hither, O Galatea! hither come, My charming Fair: Here blooms the purple Spring: Here various Flow'rs, the winding Rivers round, The Earth pours forth: Here the pale Poplar hangs O'er our cool Grot: and intermingled Vines With pliant Tendrils weave a gentle Shade.— Trap. Virg. Ecl. IX. Descended of an antient Line, That long the Tuscan Scepter sway'd, Make haste to meet the gen'rous Wine, Whose piercing is for thee delay'd: The rosy Wreath is ready made, And artful Hands prepare The fragrant Oyl that shall perfume thy Hair. From all thy cloying Plenty fly, Thy Palace leave, that rises to the Sky: Nor longer value Rome's fantastick Joys, It's Smoke, it's Riches, and it's Noise. Sometimes 'tis pleasing to the Rich to try A short Vicissitude, a Fit of Poverty: A savory Dish, a homely Treat, Where all is plain, where all is neat, Without the stately spacious Room, Or Carpets from the Tyrian Loom, Clear up the cloudy Foreheads of the Great.— Dryd. alt. Hor. Lib. III. Ode 29. Joy Publick. Loud Shouts of Joy, and glad Applauses rise, Ring round the Shores, and eccho to the Skies.— Ovid. Met. Lib. IV. The hallowed Fires on ev'ry Altar shine, And grateful Off'rings load each sacred Shrine: Proud Victims fall, their Horns with Ribbons bound, And tincture with their Blood the holy Ground. Athens ne'er knew so general a Joy: Feasting and Mirth does every Soul employ: Promiscuously the Peers and People dine, Promiscuously their thankful Voices join, In Songs of Wit, sublim'd by sprightly Wine.— Tate alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. VII. —Transported Troy Forgot her Woes, and gave a loose to Joy: Threw wide her Gates, and pour'd forth all her Train, To view th' abandon'd Camp, and empty Plain.— Pitt. Æn. Lib. II. With loud rejoycing Shouts, and gladsome Sports, And festival Applause the Streets resound: In all the Temples Quires of Matrons croud: Altars in all erected: On the Ground Before those Altars slaughter'd Oxen fall.— Trap. Æn. Lib. VIII. Iris. See Dying. Her shining Robes, rich with a thousand Dies, Iris puts on: then from the Heav'ns flies; And flying forms an Arch, a Segment of the Skies.— Ovid. Met. Lib. XI. —Down to the Trojan Fleet Saturnian Juno Iris sends from Heav'n, And breaths the Winds to speed her airy Course: The Virgin, seen by none, with wingy Speed Shoots thro' a thousand Colours of her Bow. Trap. —Uprais'd on even Wings, The Goddess mounts into the Air, and cuts Her Bow of spacious Arch beneath the Clouds.— Id. Æn. Lib. V. Mean while great Jove sends dewy Iris down, To call the Gods to Council round his Throne. Wrap'd in her colour'd Robes she swiftly flies, On gentle Zephyrs, thro' the yielding Skies.— Hughes alter'd. Claud. Rapt. Pros. Lib. III. Isis. A Glorious Train, and Isis at their Head, Or stood, or seem'd to stand, before the Bed. Her moony Horns were on her Forehead plac'd, And golden Sheaves her shining Temples grac'd, Round which a regal Diadem on high Blaz'd forth: The Dog Anubis too was by, Sacred Bubastis, glorious to the Sight, And the black Apis mark'd with Spots of White, And He, the speechless God, whose Finger laid A-cross his Lips to silence does perswade: The sounding Sistra in the Train were brought, Osiris who can ne'er enough be sought, And the strange Snake with deadly Venom fraught.— Dryden alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. IX. Great Isis! who delight'st to haunt the Fields, Where fruitful Nile it's golden Harvest yields; Where with sev'n Mouths into the Sea it falls, And tak'st thy Walks around Canope's Walls; Who Memphis visit'st, and the Pharian Tow'rs, Assist my dear One with thy friendly Pow'rs! By all thy sacred Rites I Thee conjure, A Life so precious with thy Help secure! By Anubis's venerable Face! So may'st Thou with Osiris still find Grace! So may thy Altars heap'd with Off'rings shine, And round those Offrings deadly Serpents twine! May horned Apis so thy Pomp attend, And be to Thee, as Thou'rt to her a Friend! Look down, Oh Isis! on the teeming Fair, And make at once her Life, and mine, thy Care: Save both by helping one; the Aid you give To her saves me, for 'tis by her I live. Nor undeserving is she, for she pays Her Vows to Thee on all thy solemn Days; And still attends thy Feasts to celebrate, Whene'er the Galli round thy laurel'd Altars wait.— Anon. alter'd. Ovid. Amor. Lib. II. El. 13. Italy. But neither Media's wealthy Groves, and Soil, Nor far-fam'd Ganges, nor rich Hermus' Stream, Turbid with Gold, can match Italia's Praise: Nor Bactra, India, nor Panchaia fat, All o'er, with Frankincense producing Glebe. —Here swelling Grain Abounds, and Bacchus' Massic Juice, and Oils, And Herds of shining Neat. The Warrior Steed Prances, with lofty Port, into the Field: White Flocks, and stately Bulls, of Victims chief, Oft plung'd, Clitumnus, in thy sacred Stream, To Jove's high Fane the Roman Triumphs lead. Here blooms perpetual Spring: and Summer shines In Months not Her's: Here twice the Cattle teem, The Trees twice yield their Fruit: But far from hence Is the fell Tyger, and the savage Breed Of Lions: Nor does Aconite deceive The wretched Simplers. No huge scaly Snake Snatches his Orb immense along the Ground: Nor into Spires so vast himself convolves. Add that Variety of Cities fam'd: And Labour of Artificers: on Tops Of craggy Rocks so many Towns uprear'd: And Rivers gliding under ancient Walls. The same blest Region Veins of Silver shows: Rivers of Brass: and flows in copious Gold. Hail happy Clime! Saturnian Realm! of Fruits, And Men, great Parent!— Trap. Virg. Georg. Lib. II. Jupiter. See God. Providence. With Jove, ye Muses! let the Song begin: All Things are full of Jove: He for the World Provides, indulgent.— Trap. Virg. Ecl. III. —Imperial Jove Surveying, from the Summit of the Sky, The navigable Seas, and low laid Earth, And Shores, and Nations wide, on Heav'n's high Tow'r Stood, and on Lybia's Kingdoms fix'd his Eyes. —To Him, Sad Venus, her bright Eyes all drown'd in Tears, Suppliant applies.—O Thou! whose Sov'reign Pow'r Controuls th' Affairs of Men, and Gods, with Rule Eternal, and with Thunder awes!— Æn. Lib. I. Smiling on Her, the Sire of Men and Gods, With that smooth Look which clears the stormy Sky, His Daughter gently kiss'd.— Id. Olympus now it's everlasting Doors Widely unfolds: the King of Gods and Men Summons a Council in the starry Hall: From whence, enthron'd on high, all Lands he views.— Th' Etherial Synod meets.— Th' Almighty Father then, supreme of Kings, His aweful Speech begins, and, while he speaks, Heav'n's lofty Court keeps Silence, and the Earth Trembles below, th' Etherial Arch above: Hush'd are the Winds, th' unruffled Seas subside.— Id. Æn. Lib. X. — Let Each Abide th' Event and Fortune of his Deeds: Jove is the same, one common King to All. —So spake the God: And by his Stygian Brother's pitchy Banks, And whirling Torrent, ratify'd the Doom: And all Olympus trembled at his Nod. Here ended the Debate: Imperial Jove Uprises from his Throne of Gold: the Gods Attend him to his Palace, round inclos'd.— Id. Ibid. When on their marble Seats the Gods were plac'd, And the high Throne with Jove himself was grac'd: Upon his Iv'ry Scepter first he leant, Then shook his Head, that shook the Firmament: Air, Earth, and Seas, obey'd th' Almighty Nod, And with a gen'ral Fear confess'd the God.— Dryd. alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. I. While mighty Kings o'er trembling Nations sway, Those mighty Kings themselves must Jove obey; Whose pow'rful Arm the Gyants did confound, Whose Nod turns all the Universe around.— Hor. Lib. III. Ode I. Jupiter Ammon. Now to the sacred Temple they draw near, Whose only Altars Lybian Lands revere: There, but unlike the Jove by Rome ador'd, A Form uncouth, stands Heav'n's Almighty Lord. No regal Ensigns grace his potent Hand, Nor shakes he there the Light'nings flaming Brand: But, ruder to behold, a horned Ram Appears the God, and Ammon is his Name. There tho' he reigns, unrival'd, and alone, O'er the rich Neighbours of the Torrid Zone: Tho' Ethiopia is by him possess'd, India the rich, and Araby the blest, Yet no proud Domes are rais'd, no Gems are seen, To blaze upon his Shrines with costly Sheen: But plain, and poor, and unprophan'd he stood, Such as, to whom our great Fore-fathers bow'd: A God of pious Times, and Days of old, That keeps his Temple safe from Roman Gold.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. IX. Justice. See Laws. —In Hell, advising All, The wretched Phlegyas testifies aloud With solemn Voice, and preaches thro' the Shades: “Be warn'd, learn Justice, nor contemn the Gods.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. VI. Thou, Justice, wer't the first that brought Mankind From Caves in Desarts: and the Use of Food, Wholesome, and good, didst teach the savage Race. For thy sake only We the Laws revere: To humanize the Mind, and thence expel All brutal Passions, 'tis to Thee we owe. Whose upright Soul Thee deeply has imbib'd, Fearless thro' Flames shall rush: thro' Northern Storms Shall sail undaunted: and a Host of Foes Shall overthrow, unarmed, and alone. He, ev'n in Æthiopia's scorching Plains, Shall give the Comfort of refreshing Show'rs: And him, the balmy Zephyrs of the Spring, Thro' Scythia's icy Regions shall attend.— Claud. de Mall. Theod. Cons. Who passes Judgment, e'er both Sides are heard, Tho' right his Sentence prove, is yet unjust.— Senec. Med. The more You live at Ease, the more you're blest With Pow'r, and Wealth, Preferment, and a Name, So much the stricter must be your Regard For Honesty and Justice, if you wish To have the World believe you Men of Honour.— Terent. Adelp. Justice (Divine.) See Providence. Oft have I been perplex'd with anxious Doubts: Uncertain if about this World the Gods Employ their Care, or if, without a Guide, All mortal Things at random take their Course. When I had trac'd the Order of the Whole, The Ocean's Bounds, the Winding of the Year, The fixt Vicissitude of Night and Day, Thence I concluded all Things were dispos'd By the wise Councils of a Deity: At whose Command the Stars their Rounds fulfill, And various Fruits at diff'rent Seasons grow: By whom the changeful Moon with borrow'd Beams Repleat, shines forth, and Phœbus with his own: Whose Hand stretch'd out the Shores to bound the Main; And on it's Axis, ballanc'd, hung the Ball. But, when I view'd th' Affairs of Humankind, All dark, perplext, and unaccountable: The Wicked flourishing, elate, and proud: The Righteous suff'ring, wretched, and distrest; My Faith again was stagger'd, and inclin'd, Altho' unwillingly to his Belief, Who, that the Parts of Matter hurry on At random, thro' the mighty Void, maintain'd, In no determin'd, steady, constant Course: And shift their Forms, by Chance not Wisdom rul'd. Who, or suppos'd the Gods of Reason void, Or Beings indolent at best, and weak, Of Us unknowing, and of our Affairs. But now, this Tumult of the Mind is calm'd: Rufinus' Punishment acquits the Gods: And, that the Wicked to th' utmost Pitch Of Grandeur soar, no longer I complain. They're rais'd on high to make their Fall the greater.— Claud. in Rufin. —If Humankind you scorn, And mortal Arms: Expect, at least, the Gods Will have a due Regard to Right, and Wrong.— Trap. Virg. Æ Lib. I. When, snatch'd by cruel Fate, the Good and Just, Perish, and sink untimely to the Dust. (May I the bold Confession be forgiven!) I almost think there are no Gods in Heaven.— Anon.

However great, whoe'er you are, That Earth's imperial Scepters bear, Tho' thousands in your Palace wait, And crowd your hundred Rooms of State: Of all the Slaves that cringe around, Scarce ev'n in one can Truth be found. The Furies in proud Domes reside, And thro' the Doors extended wide Steal covert Fraud, and cautious Guile, The dark Design, the treach'rous Smile, And Dagger hid:—in Publick go, Envy attends the pompous Show: Each Night outliv'd, each rising Morn, To Life renew'd, the Prince is born. How few that wait around the Throne, It's Welfare seek, and not their own! What Numbers to the Courts of Kings, Or Av'rice, or Ambition brings!— Ward. Sen. Herc. Œt. Give Ear, ambitious Princes! and be wise: Listen, and learn wherein true Greatness lies: Place not your Pride in Roofs that shine with Gems, In purple Robes, nor sparkling Diadems, Nor in Dominion, nor Extent of Land; He's only Great who can himself command. Whose Guard is peaceful Innocence, whose Guide Is faithful Reason, who is void of Pride, Checking Ambition, nor is idly vain Of the false Incense of a popular Train.— Ld. Lansdowne. Sen. Thyestes. What need of Troops, or Instruments of War, Or Parthian Arrows which destroy from far? Who Lord of his own Hopes and Fears can be, The greatest King and Conqueror is He: Blest with a Power which he derives from none, He's Great, and Happy, in Himself alone.— Id. alter'd. Ibid. Quick to reward a King should always be, To punish slow: and griev'd whenever He By Justice is compell'd to use Severity.— Claud. This great, this godlike Happiness have Kings, A Happiness which never can be lost: To succour the Distress'd, and grant to Those Who sue for Safety their protecting Pow'r.— Senec. Med. Ev'n Boys at Play to one another cry, Thou shalt be King, if Thou wilt govern right.— Hor. Lib. I. Epist. 1. He's much deceiv'd, who thinks a worthy King Can ever aim at arbitrary Sway: For Liberty ne'er flourishes so well As under a good Prince.— Claud. Stil. Lib. III. Kisses. Let's live, my dearest Lesbia! and love, The little Time that Nature lends, improve: In Love and Pleasure let us spend the Day, Nor care one Farthing what old Dotards say! The Sun may rise again when once 'tis set, Its usual Labour, and old Course repeat: But when our Day is once depriv'd of Light, Sleep is our Portion, and eternal Night. A thousand Kisses give: an hundred more: Another thousand, Lesbia! I implore: Another hundred quickly add to these: Another thousand instant let me seize: And when repeated thousands num'rous grow, We'll kiss at random, nor pretend to know How many you have lent, or what I owe. Lest wicked Envy should attempt to say, How many thousands we have kiss'd away.— Anon. alt. Catull. Carm. V. Want you to know how many Kisses Would satisfy my boundless Wishes? Not fewer than the Lybian Sands Spread o'er the parch'd Cyrene's Lands, Between Jove's Temple and the Fane Where Battus' sacred Bones remain: Not fewer than the Stars above, Which see by Night Men's stolen Love. So many Kisses would I give, (Who now for Want of Kisses grieve,) As should in Number far surmount, All that Arithmetic can count. Nor all the Force of magic Art, My Lips from yours should ever part.— Anon. alter'd. Catull. Carm. VII. Know Thyself. From Heav'n, to Mortals, sure, that Rule was sent, Of Know Thyself: and, by some God, was meant, To be our never-erring Pilot here, Thro' all the various Courses which we steer.— Congreve. Juv. Sat. XI. Seek not Thyself without Thyself to find.— Pers. Sat. I. E'er Thou attempt weak Causes to support, Be sure, be very sure, Thou'rt able for't: And don't mistake strong Lungs, and Impudence, For Harmony of Words, and Force of Sense. Fools only make Attempts beyond their Skill: A wise Man's Pow'r's the Limits of his Will.— Creech alt. Juv. Sat. XI. Thyself consider well, that Thou may'st find, How much there wants to furnish out thy Mind.— Pers. Sat IV. Sound Reason still is whispering in your Ear, Where you are sure to fail, th' Attempt forbear. Unskill'd in Hellebore, if You should try, To mix it, and mistake the Quantity, The Rules of Phisic would against You cry. The high-shoo'd Plowman, should he quit the Land, To take the Pilot's Rudder in his Hand, Artless of Stars, and of the shifting Sand; The Gods would leave him to the Waves and Wind, And think all Shame was lost in Humankind.— Dryd. Pers. Sat. V. None, none descends into himself, to find The secret Imperfections of his Mind: But ev'ry one is Eagle-ey'd to see Another's Failings and Deformity.— Id. Pers. Sat. IV. Thy Breast examine with severest Care, And find what Vices are prevailing there, What Nature plants, and what ill Customs bear. This Search is good, for a neglected Field Or Thorns, or useless Fern, will quickly yield.— Creech alt. Hor. Lib. I. Sat. III. Bless me! what an odd Composition Men are of! that they should see farther, and judge better, of other People's Affairs than their own! Teren. Heaut. Labour. See Bees. Industry. All noble Things are difficult to gain, And without Labour none can them attain. Is Gold thy Aim? what mighty Pains attend? Mountains are level'd and the Mines descend To Earth's deep Center: tho' she hides her Store, We tare her up, and reach the hidden Ore. For shining Gems we cut the burning Zone, Such Dangers are the Purchase of a Stone! The fearful Farmer makes his yearly Vow, And Pain still presseth the deceiving Plow. In War no Danger's shunn'd, we fight for Spoil: Ev'n lazy Luxury leads us on to Toil: For Food and Cloths from East to West we run, And Spend-thrifts take much Pains to be undone.— Creech alt. Man. Lib. IV. Thus to their Toils, in early Summer, run The clust'ring Bees, and labour in the Sun: Lead forth, in Colonies, their buzzing Race, Or work the liquid Sweets, and thicken to a Mass. The busy Nation flies from Flow'r to Flow'r, And hoards, in curious Cells, the golden Store. A chosen Troop before the Gate attends, Heaves off the Burdens, and relieves their Friends: Warm at the fragant Work, in Bands, they drive The Drone, a lazy Robber, from the Hive.— Pitt. Æn. Lib. I. So when the Pismires, an industrious Train, Embody'd rob some golden Heap of Grain, Studious e'er stormy Winter frowns, to lay Safe in their darksom Cells the treasur'd Prey: In one long Track, the dusky Legions lead Their Prize in Triumph thro' the verdant Mead. Here bending with the Load, a panting Throng With Force conjoyn'd heave some huge Grain along. Some, lash the Stragglers to the Task assign'd, Some, to their Ranks, the Bands that lay behind: They crowd the peopled Path in thick Array, Glow at the Work, and darken all the Way.— Id. Æn. IV. Lamentation. See Grief. Death, I confess, I 'scap'd, and broke my Bonds:— And now to me, forlorn, no Hope is left Of e'er beholding my sweet native Soil, Or my dear Children, or my long'd for Sire: Whose forfeit Lives, perhaps, for my Escape, They will demand: and expiate this Offence By their untimely Death.— Trap. Æn. Lib. 2. I, who so long had Pow'r, and Wealth, and State, Bless'd in my Children, in my Husband Great; Must now, in Poverty, an Exile mourn, Ev'n from the Tombs of my dead Offspring torn: Giv'n to Penelope, who proud of Spoil, Allots me to the Loom's ungrateful Toil: Points to her Dames, and cries, with scornful Mein, See Hector's Mother, and great Priam's Queen!— Stanyan alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. XIII. Shall Fortune still in one sad Tenor run, And still increase the Woes so soon begun? Enur'd to Sorrows from my tender Years, My Parent's Ashes drank my early Tears: My Brother next, neglecting Wealth and Fame, Ignobly burn'd in a destructive Flame. An Infant Daughter late my Griefs increas'd, And all a Mother's Cares distract my Breast.— Pope. Ovid. Epist. XXI. Landing Oppos'd. Full thirty Ships The Landing of Æneas with his auxiliary Troops, to relieve his Friends besieged by the Latins, and in the utmost Distress. transport the chosen Train, For Troy's Relief, and scour the briny Main. The careful Chief who never clos'd his Eyes, Himself the Rudder holds, the Sails supplies. He charg'd the Soldiers with preventing Care, The Flags to follow, and their Arms prepare: Warn'd of th' ensuing Fight, and bad them hope the War. Now, from his lofty Poop, he view'd below His Camp encompass'd, and th' inclosing Foe. His brazen Shield, embrac'd, he held on high: The Camp receive the Sign, and with loud Shouts reply: Hope Arms their Courage: from their Towers they throw Their Darts with double Force, and drive the Foe. Thus, at the Signal giv'n, the Cranes arise, With joyful Clang, and leave the stormy Skies. The Latins wonder'd at the Fight renew'd: Till, looking back, the Trojan Fleet they view'd: The Seas with swelling Canvas cover'd o'er, And the swift Ships descending on the Shore. But, nought dismay'd, bold Turnus' Mind is bent To man the Beach, and hinder their Descent. He thus awakes the Courage of his Friends: What You so long have wish'd kind Fortune sends: In ardent Arms to meet th' invading Foe: You find, and find him at Advantage now. Now take the Time, while stagg'ring yet they stand With Feet unfirm: attack them as they land: Fortune befriends the Bold. No more he said, But ballanc'd whom to leave, and whom to lead: Then These elects, the Landing to prevent: And Those he leaves to keep the City pent. Mean time, the Trojan sends his Troops ashore: Some are by Boats expos'd, by Bridges more: With lab'ring Oars they bear along the Strand, Where the Tide languishes, and leap to Land. Tarchon observes the Coast with careful Eyes, And where no Ford he finds, no Water fries, Nor Billows with unequal Murmur roar, But smoothly slide along, and swell the Shore: That Course he steer'd, and thus he gave Command, Here ply your Oars, and at all Hazard land: Force on the Vessel, that her Keel may wound This hated Soil, and furrow hostile Ground. Let me securely land, I ask no more, Then sink my Ships, or scatter on the Shore. This fiery Speech inflames his daring Friends, They tug at ev'ry Oar, and ev'ry Stretcher bends: They run their Ships a-ground, the Vessels knock, (Thus forc'd ashore) and tremble with the Shock. Turnus leads on his Troops without Delay, Advancing to the Margin of the Sea. The Trumpets sound a Charge. On either Hand, These fight to keep, and Those to win the Land. With mutual Blood th' Ausonian Soil is dy'd, While on it's Borders each their Claim decide. As wintry Winds contending in the Sky, With equal Rage of Lungs their Titles try: They rage, they roar: The doubtful Rack of Heav'n Stands without Motion, and the Tide undriv'n: Each bent to conquer, neither Side to yield, They long suspend the Fortune of the Field: Both Armies thus perform what Courage can, Foot set to Foot, and Man oppos'd to Man.— Dryden. Virg. Æn. Lib. X. Laws. See Justice. He that will search far into former Times, Must grant that Laws were made for fear of Crimes: Since Nature can't discern what's Wrong, or Right, What's proper to pursue, and what unfit: Yet Reason knows, to break a Neighbour's Hedge Is not so great a Sin as Sacrilege. Then fix some Rule, that Punishments may be Proportion'd to Offences, and that He, Whose Fault a gentle Beating should attone, May not be whipt with Scourges to the Bone.— Hor. Lib. I. Sat. 3. Malicious Senates, with an over Care To make Us better than our Kind can bear, Have dash'd a Spice of Envy in the Laws, And straining up too high, have spoil'd the Cause.— Dryd. Ovid. Met. Lib. X. If any Rogue vexatious Suits advance Against me, for my known Inheritance: Enter by Violence my fruitful Grounds, Or take the sacred Land-Mark from my Bounds: Those Bounds, which with Possession and with Pray'r, And offer'd Cakes, have been my annual Care: Or, if my Debtors do not keep their Day, Deny their Hands, and then refuse to pay; I must with Patience all the Terms attend, Among the common Causes that depend, Till mine is call'd:—And that long-look'd for Day Is still encumber'd with some new Delay: Perhaps, the Cloth of State is only spread, Some of the Bench perhaps are sick a-bed: That Judge is hot, and doffs his Gown, while this O'er Night was bowsy, and goes out to P?ss. So many Rubs appear, the Time is gone For hearing, and the tedious Suit goes on.— Id. Juv. Sat. XVI. Liberty. See Slavery. —He that still doth crave Must fear, and he that fears must be a Slave.— Creech. Hor. Lib. I. Epist. 10. Now, free from Care, those Slaves the People live, No longer plagu'd with Votes to sell, or give: That mighty People whom the World obey'd, Whose Voices Consuls, Armies, Emp'rors made, Now Liberty's no more, are sunk so low, Their whole Ambition asks but Bread and Show.— Dryd. Juv. Sat. X. Tell me, my Friend, from whence hast Thou the Skill, So nicely to distinguish Good from Ill? Or, by the Sound to judge of Gold and Brass, What Piece is Tinker's Metal, what will pass? And what Thou art to follow, what to fly, This to condemn, and that to ratify? When to be bountiful, and when to spare, But never craving, or oppress'd with Care? The Baits of Gifts and Money to despise, And look on Wealth with undesiring Eyes? When Thou canst truly call these Virtues thine, Be wise and free, by Heav'n's Consent, and mine. But Thou, who lately of the common Strain, Wer't one of Us, if still Thou dost retain The same ill Habits, the same Follies too, Gloss'd over only with a specious Show: Then I resume the Freedom which I gave, Still Thou art bound to Vice, and still a Slave. In spight of this, my Freedom still remains. Free! what, and fetter'd with so many Chains? Canst Thou no other Master understand, Than him that freed Thee by the Prœtor's Wand? Should he, who was thy Lord, command Thee now, With a harsh Voice, and supercilious Brow, To servile Duties, Thou would'st fear no more: The Gallows and the Whip are out of Door. But if strong Passions lord it in thy Breast, Art Thou not still a Slave, and still opprest, No less than he, whom the afflicting Rod, Compels to all the Ills of Servitude?— Dryden alter'd. Pers. Sat. V. When Thou woud'st take a lazy Morning's Nap: Up, up, says Avarice:—Thou snor'st again, Stretchest thy Limbs, and yawn'st, but all in vain: The Tyrant Lucre no Denial takes: At his command th' unwilling Sluggard wakes. What must I do? he cries:—What? says his Lord; Why rise; make ready: and go streight aboard: With Fish, from Euxine Seas, thy Vessel freight: Flax, Castor, Coan Wines, the precious Weight Of Pepper, and Sabœan Incense, take With thy own Hands from the tir'd Camel's Back; And with Post-haste thy running Markets make. Be sure to turn the Penny: lye, and swear: 'Tis wholsom Sin:—but Jove, thou sayst, will hear. Swear, Fool! or starve: for the Dilemma's even: A Tradesman Thou! and hope to go to Heav'n? Resolv'd for Sea, the Slaves thy Baggage pack, Each saddl'd with his Burden on his Back:— Nothing retards thy Voyage, now, unless Thy other Lord forbids, Voluptuousness: And he may ask this civil Question: Friend, What dost thou make a Shipboard?—to what End?— Art thou of Bedlam's noble College free? Stark, staring mad, that thou would'st tempt the Sea? Cubb'd in a Cabbin, on a Mattress laid, On a brown George, with lousy Swobbers fed: Dead Wine that stinks of the Borracchio sup, From a foul Jack, or greasy maple Cup? Say, wou'dst Thou bear all this, to raise thy Store From six i'th' Hundred to six hundred more?— Indulge, and to thy Genius freely give: For, not to live at Ease, is not to live. Death stalks behind Thee, and each flying Hour Does some loose Remnant of thy Life devour. Live, while thou liv'st: for Death will make Us all A Name,—a Nothing but an old Wife's Tale. Speak; wilt Thou Avarice or Pleasure chuse To be thy Lord?—take one, and one refuse. But both, by turns, the Rule of Thee will have: And Thou, betwixt them both, wilt be a Slave. Nor think, when once thou hast resisted One, That all thy Marks of Servitude are gone: The struggling Greyhound gnaws his Leash in vain, If, when 'tis broken, still he drags the Chain.— Dryden. Pers. Sat. V. Who then is free?—The Wise, that can controul And govern all the Passions of the Soul: Whom Poverty, nor Chains, nor Death affright; Who's Proof against the Charms of vain Delight: Who squares his Actions all by Virtue's Laws, Regardless of Contempt, or popular Applause. Whom feeble Fortune strives in vain to wound, Since in himself his Happiness is found, Collected all, and in a perfect Round.— Creech alter'd. Hor. Lib. II. Sat. 7. Get loose thy Neck from this ignoble Chain And boldly cry, I'm free.— Ibid. Life. The best of Life, which wretched Mortals share, Flies first away: Diseases, sick old Age, And Pain, and Death's Inclemency, succeed.— Trap. Virg. Georg. Lib. III. Fix'd stands the Date of mortal Lives: the Space Is short, and irretrievable to all: But by their Actions to extend their Fame, Is Virtue's Task.— Id. Virg. Æn. Lib. X. Why are we then so fond of mortal Life, Beset with Dangers, and maintain'd with Strife? A Life, which all our Care can never save; One Fate attends Us, and one common Grave. Besides, we tread but a perpetual Round; We ne'er strike out, but beat the former Ground: And the same maukish Joys in the same Track are found. For still we think an absent Blessing best; Which cloys, and is no Blessing when possess'd: A new arising Wish expels it from the Breast. The feverish Thirst of Life increases still: We call for more and more, and never have our fill: Yet know not what to Morrow we shall try: What Dregs of Life in the last Draught may lie.— Dryd. Lucret. Lib. III. Now let's suppose great Nature's Voice should call To Thee, or me, or any of Us all; What dost Thou mean, ungrateful Wretch! Thou vain, Thou mortal Thing! thus idly to complain: And sigh and sob, that Thou shalt be no more?— For, if thy Life were pleasant heretofore, If all the bounteous Blessings I could give Thou hast enjoy'd, if Thou hast known to live, And Pleasure not leak'd thro' Thee like a Sieve: Why dost Thou not give Thanks as at a plenteous Feast, Cram'd to the Throat with Life, and rise and take thy Rest? But if my Blessings Thou hast thrown away, If indigested Joys pass'd thro' and would not stay: Why dost Thou wish for more to squander still? If Life be grown a Load, a real Ill, And I would all thy Cares and Labours end, Lay down thy Burden, Fool! and know thy Friend. To please Thee I have empty'd all my Store: I can invent, and can supply no more, But run the Round again, the Round I ran before. Suppose Thou art not broken yet with Years, Yet still the self-same Scene of Things appears, And would be ever, couldst Thou ever live; For Life is still but Life, there's Nothing new to give.— Id. Ibid. Now leave those Joys, unsuiting to thy Age, To a fresh Comer, and resign the Stage. All Things, like Thee, have Times to rise and rot, And from each Others Ruin are begot: For Life is not confin'd to him or Thee; 'Tis giv'n to all for Use, to none for Property.— Id. Ibid. —Life posts away, And Day from Day drives on with swift Career, The Wheel that hurries on the headlong Year.— Addison. Senec. Her. fur. The Flow of Life brings in a wealthy Store: The Ebb draws back whate'er was brought before.— Eames. Hor. Art. Poet. Lion. —As when a Lion, pinch'd With raging Hunger, ranges round the Stalls: If chance he spy a tim'rous Goat, or Deer Lofty with branching Horns: he yawns o'er-joy'd With vast expanded Jaws, erects his Mane, Sticks to the Prey, and lies upon it press'd Close to the Ground. Black Gore, besmearing, laves His savage Mouth.— Trap. Æn. Lib. X. The lordly Lion thus, on Lybia's Plain, Gor'd by the Hunter's Spear, within his Breast Infix'd, at length springs furious to the Fight, And shakes with dreadful Pride his shaggy Mane: Intrepid snaps the sticking Dart, and roars, And foams with bloody Mouth.— Id. Æn. Lib. XII. So foams the Lion thro' the crowded Folds, By furious Hunger pinch'd: and rends, and drags The tender Cattle, mute with Fear: and raves With bloody Mouth,— Id. Æn. Lib. IX. As when a Lion seizes fome fair Cow, The Grace of all the Herd, and with his Claws Tares out it's reeking Bowels: o'er the Prey Furious he stands, and growling gluts his Maw: Besmear'd with Gore, he shakes his rugg'd Mane; And scorns the Shepherds unavailing Rage.— Claud. Rapt. Pros. So, when on sultry Libya's desart Sand, The Lion spies the Hunter hard at Hand, Couch'd on the Earth the doubtful Savage lies, And waits a-while till all his Fury rise: His lashing Tail provokes his swelling Sides, And high upon his Neck his Mane with Horror rides: Then, if at length the flying Dart infest, Or the broad Spear invade his ample Breast, Scorning the Wound he yawns a dreadful Roar, And flies like Light'ning on the hostile Moor.— Rowe.

But no such Symptom in his Looks I read: That noble Spirit, and that manly Grace, Can never sure belong to One that's base.— Tate alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. VII. O Life! deceitful! ever in Disguise! With a fair Face thou hid'st a wicked Heart. Pretended Modesty is made the Mask Of Impudence: the Daring and Ambitious Seem satisfy'd, and covetous of Peace: Guilt skulks beneath the Cloak of Piety: The False and Treach'rous ring the Praise of Truth: And Cowards counterfeit the Bold and Brave.— Senec. Hyppol. Men's Looks are false, to them no Credit give. Juv. Sat. II. Love. See Lover. Venus. Great Love! thy Empire o'er the World extends! To thy soft Charms the whole Creation bends! On Hills, in Streams, thro' all the rolling Main, The leafy Forest, and the grassy Plain, Thy kindling Warmth the various Nations find, And rush with Joy to generate their Kind.— Luc. L. I. Such is the Nature of that pleasing Smart, Whose burning Drops distil upon the Heart: The Fever of the Soul, shot from the Fair, And the cold Ague of succeeding Care. If absent, her Idea still appears: And her sweet Name is chiming in your Ears.— Dryden. Lucret. L. IV. Nature for Meat and Drink provides a Space, And when receiv'd they fill their certain Place: Hence Thirst and Hunger may be satisfy'd; But this Repletion is to Love deny'd.— Id. However charming Beauty may excite The longing Lover's endless Appetite, His fond deluded Grasp can only find Aerial Shapes, that fleet before the Wind.— Id. alter'd. As he, who in a Dream with Drought is curst, And finds no real Drink to quench his Thirst, Runs to imagin'd Lakes his Heat to steep, And vainly swills and labours in his Sleep: So Love with Phantoms cheats our longing Eyes, Which hourly seeing never satisfies.— Dryden. Ibid. —Cruel Love! To what Extreams does not thy Tyrant Pow'r Urge mortal Breasts?— Æn. Lib. IV. Of ev'ry Kind on Earth, of Men, and Beasts, Of Cattle, Fish, and parti-colour'd Fowl, All rush into this Frenzy, and this Fire: Love is the same to All.— What does that Leander. Youth, whom unrelenting Love Consumes, and with his Vitals blends his Fire?— Darkling, in dead of Night, he swims the Sea Turbid with sudden Storms: while o'er his Head Thunders the Gate of Heav'n, and from the Rocks With dreadful Roar the broken Waves rebound: Nor can his wretched Parents Tears, nor She, Th' unhappy Maid, whose Death must follow his, Disswade him.— Trap. Virg. Geor. Lib. III. Love is a Warfare: and ignoble Sloth Seems equally contemptible in both: In both are Watchings, Marches, cruel Cares: The Soldier thus, and thus the Lover fares. With Rain he's drench'd, with the rough Tempest shakes, And on the naked Ground his Lodging takes.— Dryden. Ovid. Art. Am. II. What Hares on Athos, Bees on Hybla feed, Or Berries on the Tree of Pallas breed, What num'rous Shells the sandy Shores afford, With Woes as num'rous anxious Love is stor'd.— Art. Amand. Lib. II.

In Love's soft Transport tost, My every Sense at once was lost, When first I saw Thee: not a Word Could my disabled Tongue afford: My Bosom glow'd: the subtle Flame Ran quick thro' all my vital Frame: My Ears with hollow Murmurs rung: And o'er my Eyes a Darkness hung.— Philips alter'd. Catul. Epig. 52. Apollo falling in Love with Daphne.He view'd her Eyes; like heav'nly Lamps that shone; He view'd her Lips: too sweet to view alone; Her Fingers, and her Hands, his Passion raise, While his fond Tongue grows wanton in their Praise: Her Shoulders almost bare, her fine turn'd Arms He views, and thinks her Dress conceals superior Charms. As Fields of Stubble after Harvest burn: As Hedges into sudden Blazes turn, If Passengers, or bring too near, or throw When Light their Torches by, and kindle all the Row. So burns the God, consuming with Desire, And feeding in his Breast a fruitless Fire.— Dryd. alter'd. Ov. Met. I. Europa's Son Scylla falls in Love with Minos, who was besieging her Father Nisus in his Capital City. she knew above the rest, And more than well became a Virgin Breast: In vain the crested Helmet veils his Face, She thinks it adds a more commanding Grace: His ample Shield, emboss'd with burnish'd Gold, Still makes the Bearer lovelier to behold: When the tough Javelin, with a Whirl, he sends, His Strength and Skill the sighing Maid commends: Or, when he strains to draw the circling Bow, And his fine Limbs a manly Posture show, Compar'd with Phœbus, he performs so well, Let her be Judge, and Minos shall excell. But when the Helm, put off, display'd to Sight, And set his Features in an open Light: When vaulting to his Seat, his Steed he press'd, Caparison'd in Gold, and richly drest: Himself in Scarlet sumptuously array'd; New Passions rise, and fire the frantic Maid. O happy Spear! she cries, that feels his Touch: Nay, ev'n the Reins he holds are blest too much.— Croxall. Ovid. Met. Lib. VIII. Thee, with thy Mother, in our Meads I saw, Gath'ring fresh Apples: I myself thy Guide: Then Thou wert little: I, just then advanc'd To my twelfth Year, could barely from the Ground Touch with my reaching Hand the tender Boughs: How did I look! how gaze my Soul away! How did I die! in fatal Error lost!— Trap. Virg. Ecl. VIII. Love Mutual. In Babylon, whose haughty Semiramis. Queen for State, Rais'd Walls of Brick magnificently great, Liv'd Pyramus and Thisbe: lovely Pair! He found no Eastern Youth his Equal there, And she beyond the fairest Nymph was fair. These two, as tho' by Fate for each design'd, Were such near Neighbours that their Houses join'd: Acquaintance grew; Acquaintance they improve To Friendship: Friendship ripen'd into Love: Love had been crown'd, but impotently mad, What Parents could not hinder, they forbad. She lov'd like Pyramus, like Thisbe He, For both felt Passion in the last Degree: But Prudence taught, their Passion to disguise, (Refraining Words, for fear of list'ning Spies,) To correspond by Nods, and speaking Eyes. The Fire of Love the more it is supprest, The more it glows, and rages in the Breast.— Eusden alt. Ovid. Met. Lib. IV. While on Septimius' panting Breast, Acme lean'd her loving Head, Thus the pleas'd Septimius said. My dearest Acme if I be Once alive, and love not Thee, With a Passion far above All that e'er was called Love, In a Lybian Desart may I become some Lion's Prey: Let him, Acme, let him tear My Breast, when Acme is not there. The God of Love who stood to hear him (The God of Love was always near him) Pleas'd and tickled with the Sound, Sneez'd aloud: and all around, The little Loves that waited by, Bow'd, and bless'd the Augury. Acme enflam'd with what he said, Rear'd her gently-bending Head: And her purple Mouth with Joy Stretching to the delicious Boy, Twice (and twice could scarce suffice) She kiss'd his drunken rolling Eyes. My little Life! my All! said she, So may we ever Servants be To this best God, and ne'er retain Our hated Liberty again: So may thy Passion last for Me, As I a Passion have for Thee: Greater and fiercer much than can Be conceiv'd by Thee a Man: Into my Marrow it is gone, Fix'd and settl'd in the Bone: It reigns not only in my Heart, But runs, like Life, thro' ev'ry Part. She spoke: the God of Love aloud Sneez'd again, and all the Crowd Of Little Loves that waited by Bow'd, and bless'd the Augury. This good Omen, thus from Heav'n, Like a happy Signal giv'n, Their Loves and Lives, all four, embrace, And Hand in Hand run all the Race. To poor Septimius, (who did now Nothing else but Acme grow) Acme's Bosom was alone The whole World's Imperial Throne: And to the faithful Acme's Mind, Septimius was all Humankind. Happy Lover! happy Fair! Who e'er knew so blest a Pair?— Cowley alter'd. Catull. Carm. XLVI. So bright, so beauteous now the Youth appears, As does the Sun, when with refulgent Ray, The Clouds he dissipates, and gives the Day. The Sight so warms the fair admiring Maid, Like Snow she melts: so soon can Youth perswade. Consent, on eager Wings, succeeds Desire: And both the Lovers glow with mutual Fire.— Garth alt. Ovid. Met. Lib. XIV. Belov'd by many Maidens of Cyllarus the Centaur. his Kind, Hylonome alone possess'd his Mind: Not less her Blandishments than Beauty move, At once both loving, and confessing Love. They for each other felt an equal Flame, And still their sylvan Pleasures were the same: All Day they hunted: and when Day expir'd, Together to some shady Cave retir'd. Uncertain from what Hand, a flying Dart At Cyllarus was sent: which pierc'd his Heart. The Jav'lin drawn from out the mortal Wound, He faints with stagg'ring Steps, and seeks the Ground. The fair within her Arms receiv'd his Fall, And strove his wand'ring Spirits to recall: And while her Hand the streaming Blood oppos'd, Joyn'd Face to Face his Lips with her's she clos'd. Soon as she saw him dead, she seiz'd the Dart, New-drawn, and reeking from her Lover's Heart: To her bare Bosom the sharp Point apply'd, And wounded fell: and falling by his Side, Embrac'd him in her Arms, and thus embracing dy'd.— Dryd. alt. Ovid. Met. Lib. XII. Lover. See Love. Offer an Apple to a peevish Boy, And he'll refuse it:—Here, my pretty Joy, Come, prithee take it:—No, Sir, I'll have none: Yet, if unoffer'd, he would beg for one. Like him's the Lover, who hath su'd in vain; In doubt he stands, if to return again, When he's desir'd; tho' he would gladly wait Unask'd, and linger at the hated Gate. Now she invites, and swears she will be kind: What! shall I go, or rather cure my Mind? She shuts me out; then courts me to return: What! shall I go?—No, tho' she begs, I'll scorn. But lo, his wiser Slave did thus reprove:— Sir, Reason must be never us'd in Love: It's Laws unequal, and its Rules unfit: For Love's a Thing, by Nature opposite, To common Reason, common Sense, and Wit. All is in Love, unsteady, empty, vain, There's War and Peace, and Peace and War again. Now he that strives to settle such as these, Meer things of Chance, and faithless as the Seas, He might as well design to be a Fool By Art and Wisdom, and run mad by Rule.— Creech alt. Hor. Lib. II. Sat. 3. The Tribe of Lovers, led by blind Desire, Imagine Charms, and then those Charms admire. Thou view'st thy Mistress with a partial Eye: No Fault she has, or thou no Fault can'st spy. The sallow Skin is for the swarthy put, And Love can make a Slattern of a Slut: If Cat-ey'd, then a Pallas is thy Love: If freckled, she's a party-colour'd Dove. If little, then she's Life and Soul all o'er: An Amazon, the large two-handed Whore. She stammers: Oh, what Grace in lisping lies! If she says nothing, to be sure she's wise. If shrill, and with a Voice to drown a Choir, Sharp-witted she must be, and full of Fire. The lean, consumptive Wench, with Coughs decay'd, Is call'd a pretty, tight, and slender Maid. Th' o'ergrown, a goodly Ceres is exprest, A Bed-Fellow for Bacchus at the least. Flat Nose the Name of Joker never misses: And hanging blobber Lips, but pout for Kisses.— Dryd. Lucret. Lib. IV. Says Phœdra to his Man, Believe me, Friend, To this uneasy Love I'll put an End: Shall I run out of all, my Friends disgrace, And be the first lewd Unthrift of my Race? Shall I the Neighbour's nightly Rest invade At her deaf Doors, with some vile Serenade? Well hast thou freed thyself, his Man replies, Go thank the Gods, and offer Sacrifice. Ah! says the Youth, if we unkindly part, Will not the poor fond Creature break her Heart? Weak Soul! and blindly to Destruction led! She break her Heart! she'll sooner break thy Head: She knows her Man, and when you rant and swear, Can draw you to her with a single Hair. But shall I not return? Now, when she sues? Shall I my own and her Desires refuse? Sir, take your Course: but my Advice is plain: Once freed, 'tis Madness to resume your Chain.— Dryden. Pers. Sat. V. As Wax dissolves, as Ice begins to run, And trickle into Drops before the Sun, So melts the Narcissus. Youth, and languishes away, His Beauty withers, and his Limbs decay.— Addison. Ov. Met. III. Mean while In Love with Jason. Medea seiz'd with fierce Desire, By Reason strives to quench the raging Fire: But strives in vain!—Some God, she cries, withstands, And Reason's baffl'd Council countermands. What unseen Power does this Disorder move? 'Tis Love:—at least, 'tis like what Men call Love. Wretch! from thy Virgin Breast this Flame expel, And soon:—Ah could I, all would then be well! But Love, resistless Love my Soul invades: Discretion this, Affection that perswades. I see the Right, and I approve it too: Condemn the wrong,—and yet the wrong pursue.— Tate. —Now her Face, by turns, Deadens with Paleness, and with Blushes burns: As Fire, that sleeping under Ashes lies, Fresh-blown, and rouz'd, does up in Blazes rise, So rose her Passion at the Hero's Sight, (Tho' dead it seem'd before,) and rag'd outright. Her ravish'd Eyes survey him o'er and o'er, As some bright Being never seen before: Fixt to his lovely Face she seems to be, And thinks she gazes on a Deity. But when he spoke, and press'd her trembling Hand, And did with tender Words her Aid demand, With Vows and Oaths to take her for his Bride: She wept a Flood of Tears, and thus reply'd: I see my Error, yet to Ruin move, Nor owe my Fate to Ignorance, but Love.— Id. alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. VII. Now with consuming Care the restless Dido. Queen Already bleeding, nourishes a Wound Deep in her Veins, and wastes with hidden Fire. Much to her Thoughts the Hero's brave Exploits Recur, and much the Glories of his Race: Fix'd in her Soul his Looks, and Words remain: And soft Repose is banish'd from her Breast. Th' unhappy Dido burns, and wildly roves O'er all the City: like a wounded Deer, Whom heedless of her Fate, in Cretian Woods The Swain at Distance with his Shafts pursu'd, And in her Body left the missive Steel, Unknowing: She thro' the Dictœan Groves, And Thickets flying strays: the mortal Dart Sticks in her Side.—Sometimes the Trojan Prince She takes alone, and leads him round the Walls: Begins to speak, and in the middle stops Her falt'ring Tongue. At Ev'ning she renews Her Banquets: fondly begs again to hear The Trojan Wars: again, while He relates, She listens fix'd, and hangs upon the Sound. Then, after All are to their Rest retir'd, When in her turn the Moon obscure withdraws Her Light, and setting Stars persuade to Sleep: Lonely she pines within the empty Court, Lies on the Couch, which just before she left: Him absent, absent still she hears, and sees.— Sometimes, his Father's Image all her Soul Possessing, young Ascanius on her Lap She long detains; if possible, to cheat With that Amusement her unbounded Love. Th' unfinish'd Tow'rs no longer rise; the Youth, Undisciplin'd in Arms, no longer form Ports, and strong Fortresses of War: the Works Neglected stand.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. IV. Reliev'd with soft Repose the Beasts and Birds, Forget their Cares, and lose the Toils of Day: Not so the wretched Dido: no sweet Sleep Lulls her a Moment: In her Eyes, or Soul, Not for a Moment she receives the Night: Her Pangs redouble: Love with boiling Foam Rages afresh, and with a various Tide Of warring Passions fluctuates in her Breast.— Id. Ibid. Lover Desperate. Fair Anaxaretè, of Form divine, High-born, from ancient Teucer's Royal Line, Poor Iphis saw, a mean-descended Swain, And, seeing, felt Love glow in every Vein. Reason long struggled to destroy his Flame, But when no Reason could his Madness tame, An humble Suitor to her House he came: There to her Nurse his wretched Case display'd, And, for her Mistress' Sake, implor'd her Aid: Each fav'rite Servant too, with earnest Pray'r, He begg'd to speed his Passion to the Fair. Letters indited in the softest Strain, Frequent he sends, expressive of his Pain. Oft to the Columns flow'ry Wreaths he ties, Bedew'd with Tears that trickle from his Eyes: Oft, at his Length, on the hard Threshold laid, His Groans th' inexorable Gates upbraid. The Nymph more deaf than Seas, when Tempests roar, And foaming Surges dash the sounding Shore: Harder than burnish'd Steel, or rooted Rocks, Disdains the Lover, and his Passion mocks: Of Insolence arraigns th' aspiring Swain, And proudly tells him, all his Hopes are vain. Despairing Iphis could endure no more The Torments of his Grief:— But utter'd these last Words before her Door. Thy Conquest is compleat, relentless Maid! Of my bold Love be never more afraid: Triumph, O Anaxaretè! unkind! Sing Pœans, and thy Brows with Lawrel bind: Thou hast o'ercome, and willingly I die: Hard-hearted Fair, enjoy thy Cruelty! Yet even Thou shalt publish my Desert, And feel soft Pity working in thy Heart: To think thy Charms have kindled such a Fire, As could not, but with Life itself, expire. Nor will I trust Report my Death to spread, Thyself shall see it, and behold me dead: My wretched Life I'll end before thy Gate, To please thy cruel Pride, and glut thy Hate. But, Oh, You Gods! if Mortals Fates you know, Remember me, and this one Boon bestow; Let After-Ages celebrate my Name, And what You take from Life, make up in Fame. This said, he upwards to the Door-posts bends His watry Eyes, and his pale Arms extends: Then to the Top, so oft with Garlands crown'd, A fatal Halter, with a Noose, he bound. Such Wreaths best please thy savage Soul, he said, Inhuman, cruel, unrelenting Maid! Fitting the Rope, towards her he turning sprung, And, by the Neck, th' unhappy Lover hung: In Death's strong Pangs his Feet kick'd ope the Door, Which seem'd with groan-like Sounds his Rashness to deplore. With Shrieks the Servants view the dying Swain, And lend their Help, but all their Help is vain. Breathless and pale they to his Mother bore Her strangled Son, his Father dead before: The lifeless Corpse she in her Bosom plac'd, And in her Arms his cold dead Limbs embrac'd: Lamenting long, as woeful Parents use, And paying all a woeful Mother's Dues, The Fun'ral Pomp she thro' the City led, And to his Pile bore the lamented Dead. It chanc'd the cruel Virgin's Dwelling lay, Just where the Mourners took their solemn Way: Their Lamentations loud her Ears invade, And Heav'ns just Vengeance close pursues the Maid. Let's view this mournful Pomp, surpriz'd, she cries; And instant to the open Window flies: Whence seeing Iphis on his burial Bed, Her Eye-Balls stiffen'd, and her Colour fled. Retire she would, but fixt was forc'd to stay, And strove in vain to turn her Eyes away: Life left her by Degrees, and every Part To Stone was harden'd, like her stony Heart.— Ovid. Met. Lib. XIV. No Mean, no Cure for Love was left, but Death: Death pleas'd: Myrrha in love with her Father Cinyras. She rose, resolv'd to stop her Breath. And while her Girdle round the Beam she ty'd, Farewell, Dear Cinyras! she softly cry'd: Of my untimely End know you're the Cause: Then round her Neck the fatal Noose she draws. The Nurse, who lay without, her faithful Guard, Tho' not the Words, the Murmurs over-heard: Startled she rises, opes the Door, and straight Beholds the ready Instrument of Fate. Screaming she beats her Breast, and rends her Hairs, And from the Virgin's Neck the Halter tares.— Dryd. alt. Ovid. Met. Lib. X. Lover's Leap. —O you that love in vain! Fly hence: and seek the far Leucadian Main: There stands a Rock, from whose impending Steep, Apollo's Fane surveys the rolling Deep: There injur'd Lovers leaping from above, Their Flames extinguish, and forget to love. Deucalion once with hopeless Fury burn'd, In vain he lov'd, relentless Pyrrha scorn'd: But when from hence he plung'd into the Main, Deucalion scorn'd, and Pyrrha lov'd in vain. Haste, thither haste: from high Leucadia throw Your wretched Weight, nor dread the Deeps below.— Pope. Ovid. Sap. Phaoni. Lust. Tereus beheld the Philomela his Wife's Sister. Virgin, and admir'd, And with the Coals of burning Lust was fir'd: Like crackling Stubble, or the Summer Hay, When forked Lightnings o'er the Meadows play. Such Charms in any Breast might kindle Love, But him the Heats of inbred Lewdness move. Straight her Attendants he designs to buy, And with large Bribes her Governess would try: Herself with ample Gifts resolves to bend, And his whole Kingdom in th' Attempt expend: Or, snatch'd away by Force of Arms, to bear, And justify the Rape with open War.— All Things he dares, provok'd by wild Desire: Nor can his Breast endure so fierce a Fire.— Croxall alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. VI. Her snowy Arms her aged Sire embrace, And clasp his Neck with an endearing Grace. Tereus surveys her with a luscious Eye, And in his Mind forestalls the blissful Joy: Her circling Arms a Scene of Lust inspire, And ev'ry Kiss foments the raging Fire. Fondly he wishes for the Father's Place, To feel, and to return the warm Embrace: Nor would the nearest Ties of filial Blood, Abate his Flame, or force him to be good.— Croxall. Ibid. Now Philomela, scarce receiv'd on Board, And in the Royal gilded Barque secur'd: While from the Shore with Oars and Sails it flies, We've gain'd our Point! the rough Barbarian cries:— Now I possess the dear, the blissful Hour, And ev'ry Wish subjected to my Pow'r! Transports of Lust his vicious Thoughts employ, And he forbears, with Pain, th' expected Joy. His gloating Eyes incessantly survey'd The Virgin Beauties of the lovely Maid. As when the bold rapacious Bird of Jove, With crooked Talons stooping from above, Has snatch'd, and carry'd to his lofty Nest A captive Hare, with cruel Gripes opprest: Secure, with fix'd and unrelenting Eyes, He sits, and views the helpless trembling Prize. Ibid. Their Vessels now had made th' intended Land, And all with Joy descend upon the Strand: When the false Tyrant seiz'd the princely Maid, And to a Lodge in distant Woods convey'd: Pale, sinking, and distress'd with jealous Fears, And asking for her Sister all in Tears. The Letcher, for Enjoyment fully bent, No longer now conceal'd his base Intent; But with rude Haste the blooming Maid deflow'r'd, Alone, defenceless, and with Ease o'erpow'r'd. Her piercing Accents to her Sire complain, And to her absent Sister, but in vain! In vain she importunes, with doleful Cries, Each unattentive Godhead of the Skies. She pants, and trembles, like the bleating Prey, From some close-hunted-Wolf just snatch'd away, That still, with fearful Horror, looks around, And on its Flank regards the bleeding Wound: Or as a Dove, whose bloody Feathers show The cruel Fury of her greedy Foe, Still pants, and trembles, tho' the Danger's o'er, And dreads the Talons, which she felt before.— Croxall alt. Ibid. Luxury. See Extravagance. Gluttony. Mean time his Lordship lolls within at Ease, Pamp'ring his Paunch with foreign Rarities: Both Sea and Land are ransack'd for the Feast, And his own Gut the sole invited Guest: Such Plate, such Tables, Dishes dress'd so well, That whole Estates are swallow'd at a Meal.— Dryden.

Now ev'n Apicius frugal seems, and poor, Outvy'd in Luxury unknown before.— Id. Juv. Sat. IV. You ask from whence proceed these monstrous Crimes? Once poor, and therefore chaste, in former Times Our Matrons were: No Luxury found Room In low-roof'd Houses, and bare Walls of Loom: Their Hands with Labour harden'd while 'twas light, And frugal Sleep supply'd the quiet Night, While pinch'd with Want, their Hunger held 'em straight, And Hannibal was hov'ring at the Gate. But wanton, now, and lolling at our Ease, We suffer all th' inveterate Ills of Peace And wasteful Riot, whose destructive Charms Revenge the vanquish'd World of our victorious Arms. No Crime, no lustful Actions are unknown, Since Poverty, our Guardian God, is gone. Pride, Laziness, and all luxurious Arts, Pour like a Deluge in from foreign Parts. Since Gold obscene, and Silver found the Way, Strange Fashions with strange Bullion to convey. And our plain simple Manners to betray.— Id. Juv. Sat. VI. Those fatal Seeds luxurious Vices sow, Which ever lay a mighty People low. To Rome the vanquish'd Earth her Tribute paid, And deadly Treasures to her View display'd: Then Truth and simple Manners left the Place, While Riot rear'd her lewd dishonest Face: Virtue to full Prosperity gave way, And fled from Rapine and the Lust of Prey. On every Side proud Palaces arise, And lavish Gold each common Use supplies: Their Father's frugal Tables stand abhorr'd, While foreign Dainties smoke upon the Board: In silken Robes the minion Men appear, Which Maids and youthful Brides should blush to wear. That Age, by honest Poverty adorn'd, Which brought the manly Romans forth, is scorn'd: Where-ever ought pernicious does abound, For Luxury all Lands are ransack'd round, And dear-bought Deaths the sinking State confound. Lucan. Lib. I. Hence Wrath and Rage their ready Minds invade, And Want could ev'ry Wickedness perswade: Hence impious Pow'r was first esteem'd a Good, Sought for by Arms, and bought with Streams of Blood: With Glory, Tyrants did their Country awe, And Violence prescrib'd the Rule to Law. Hence pliant servile Voices were constrain'd, And Force in popular Assemblies reign'd: Consuls and Tribunes, with opposing Might, Join'd to confound and overturn the Right: Hence shameful Magistrates were made for Gold, And a base People by themselves were sold: Hence Slaughter in the venal Field returns, And Rome her yearly Competition mourns: Hence Debt unthrifty, careless to repay, And Usury still watching for its Day: Hence Perjuries in ev'ry wrangling Court: And War, the needy Bankrupt's last Resort.— Rowe. Ibid. — Eutrapelus, Bestow'd fine Cloaths on those he meant to hurt. A gaudy Dress will make the Wearer vain, Thought he, and change his Purposes and Hopes: He'll sleep till Noon: his Business he'll neglect, To follow Whores, and deeply run in Debt: Till, beggar'd quite, a Bully he'll become, Or drive an Herb-man's Cart for wretched Hire.— Hor. Lib. I. Ep. 18. Magic Power. See Circe. Enchantress. Charms ev'n from Heav'n can conjure down the Moon: Circe with Charms Ulysses' Mates transform'd: In Meadows the cold Snake with Charms is burst. These Poisons, and these magic Simples, cull'd In Pontus (many such in Pontus grow) Sage Mœris gave me: Oft with These I've seen Mœris into a Wolf himself transform, And howling seek the Woods: oft raise up Ghosts From Graves: and Crops to Fields not their's transfer.— Trap. Virg. Ecl. VIII. A wreath-horn'd Ram is brought, so far o'ergrown With Years, his Years was to that Age unknown: His craggy Throat Medea. she cuts, and lets out Life: The little Blood scarce stains the wounding Knife. The Carcass in the boiling Cauldron swims, And Drugs are blended with the mangled Limbs: Each Limb, now lessen'd by Degrees, appears, He casts his Horns, and with his Horns his Years, And soon a tender Bleating strikes their Ears. While they admire, forth skips a frisking Lamb, That bounds away, and wants to suck the Dam.— Tate alt. Ovid. Met. Lib. VII. The coldest Hearts Thessalian Numbers warm, And ruthless Bosoms own the potent Charm: In frozen Age they rouse perverse Desire, And kindle into Lust the wintry Sire. Where noxious Cups, and pois'nous Philters fail, More potent Spells, and mystic Verse prevail. No Draught so strong the Little fleshy Excrescencies upon the Foreheads of Foals, which the Mares bite off as soon as they are foaled. If they are hindered from so doing, and these Knots are cut away, 'tis said they'll hate their Foals, and not suffer them to suck. They were accounted of mighty Efficacy in Love Potions. Knots of Love prepare, Cropt from her Younglings by the Parent Mare. Ev'n those whom neither Ties of nuptial Love, Nor Beauty's radiant Blandishments could move, Melt, as the Thread runs on, and sighing, feel The giddy Whirling of the magic Wheel. Charm'd by the Hag's all powerful Command, Eternal Motion stops her active Hand: The glorious Sun forgets his Time to rise, And pitchy Night pollutes the sable Skies: No more Heav'n's rapid Circles roll away, But universal Nature's at a Stay: Great Jupiter, with Wonder, sees the Pole, Urg'd onward by himself, refuse to roll. Now, at a Word, the Rains pour down apace, And bellying Clouds obscure the Sun's bright Face: Surpriz'd again, from his celestial Tow'r, Jove hears around unbidden Thunders roar: Once more they speak, and shake their flowing Hair, And strait the Storms are gone, the Heav'ns are fair. In the still Calm they bid the Waves run high, Or smooth the Deep, tho' Boreas shakes the Sky; The stretching Canvas swell against the Wind: This blows before, and that is fill'd behind. Streams have run back at Murmurs of their Tongue, And Torrents from the Rock, suspended, hung.— Rowe alt. Lucan. Lib. VI. Each deadly Kind, by Nature form'd to kill, Fear the dire Hags, and execute their Will. Lions, to them, their nobler Rage submit, And fawning Tygers couch beneath their Feet. For them the Snake forgoes her wintry Hold, And on the hoary Frost untwines her Fold. The mangled Viper they can re-unite, Or with their poys'nous Breath the Serpent split.— Id. alt Ibid. Magic the starry Lamps from Heav'n can tare, And shoot them headlong, gleaming thro' the Air: Can blot fair Cynthia's Countenance serene, And poison with foul Spells the silver Queen: Now, pale, the ghastly Goddess shrinks with Dread, And now, black smoky Fires involve her Head: As when Earth's envious interposing Shade, Cuts off her beamy Brother from her Aid. Held by the potent Charm, she strives in vain, And labours with the long pursuing Pain: Till down, and downward still, compell'd to come, On hallow'd Herbs she sheds her fatal The Ancients fancy'd the Moon to be drawn down from Heaven by Witchcraft, when she was eclipsed; and that, at those Times, she shed a Sort of venomous Juice upon certain Herbs, of great Use in Magic. Foam.— Id. Ibid. Maid Marriageable. The Maid, now past an Infant, feels the Flames Of sprightly Love, and innocently claims: She hopes the nuptial State, but hopes with Fear: And wishes, but her Wish is unsincere.— Claud. Rapt. Pros. Majesty. Up to the Temple moves the beauteous Queen, Dido, surrounded with a Troop of Guards: As on Eurotas' Banks, or Cynthus' Top Diana leads her Train: a thousand Nymphs Enclose her round: Herself her Quiver bears High on her Shoulder, and with stately Walk O'er-looks them all: a secret Pleasure slides Along Latona's Breast. Such Dido was, So smiling thro' the Crowd she pass'd.— Then in the Entrance of the Dome, beneath The middle of the Temple's Arch, she sat, Fenc'd round with Arms: and, on her Throne aloft Leaning majestic, to her Subjects gave Commands and Laws— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. I. Their Queen, whom in her Chamber Dress detains, Before her Gates the Punic Nobles wait: Her Steed adorn'd with Purple, and with Gold, Stands pawing, fierce, and champs the foaming Bit. At length attended with a num'rous Guard, She comes majestic: Her Sidonian Vest Border'd with crimson Fringe: Her Quiver, Gold: Her Tresses in a golden Knot confin'd: A golden Buckle clasps her purple Robe.— Id. Virg. Æn. Lib. IV. Mean while the Kings in long Procession move; High in his Chariot, by four Horses drawn, Latinus rides: twelve golden Rays inclose His Temples round: illustrious Argument Of his high Lineage, from the Sun deriv'd. In his white Car, young Turnus next succeeds, Shaking two Jav'lins of broad pointed Steel. Then, from the opposite embattl'd Line, Comes the great Father of the Roman Race, Æneas, with his Shield's broad starry Orb All bright, and blazing in celestial Arms: Ascanius by his Side, the other Hope Of mighty Rome.— Id. Æn. Lib. XII. A Sword, all starr'd with Gems, and spangled o'er With yellow Jaspers, at his Side he wore; A Robe refulgent from his Shoulders flow'd, That flaming deep with Tyrian Crimson glow'd: The Work of Dido! whose unrivall'd Art, With Flow'rs of Gold embroider'd ev'ry Part.— Pitt. Æn. IV. Man. See Infant. A creature of a more exalted Kind Was wanting yet, and then was Man design'd: Conscious of Thought, of more capacious Breast, For Empire form'd, and fit to rule the rest. Whether with Particles of heav'nly Fire The God of Nature did his Soul inspire, Or Earth, but new divided from the Sky, And, pliant still, retain'd th' Ætherial Energy. Whilst all the mute Creation downwards bend Their Sight, and to their earthy Mother tend, Man looks aloft: and with erected Eyes Beholds his own hereditary Skies.— Dryden. Ovid. Met. Lib. I. Time was, when we were sow'd, and just began; Meerly the Hope, and Promise of a Man: Then Nature's Hand (fermented as it was) Moulded to Shape the soft coagulated Mass. In Time the little Man is fully form'd, The breathless Embrio with a Spirit warm'd: And when the Mother's Throws begin to come, The Creature, pent within the narrow Womb, Breaks his blind Prison: pushing to repair His stifled Breath, and draw the living Air, Cast on the Margin of the World he lies, An helpless Baby, and by Instinct cries. He next essays to walk, but downward press'd, On four Feet imitates his Brother Beast: By slow Degrees he gathers from the Ground His Legs, and to the Rolling-Chair is bound: Then walks alone:—a Horseman now become, He rides a Stick, and travels round the Room. In time he vaunts among his youthful Peers, Strong-bon'd, and strung with Nerves, in Pride of Years: He runs with Mettle his first merry Stage: Maintains the next, abated of his Rage, But manages his Strength, and spares his Age. Heavy the third, and stiff, he sinks apace, And tho' 'tis down-hill all, but creeps along the Race. Now sapless on the Verge of Death he stands, Contemplating his former Feet and Hands: And Milo-like, his slacken'd Sinews sees, And wither'd Arms, once fit to cope with Hercules, Unable now to shake, much less to tare the Trees.— Dryd. Ovid. Met. Lib. XV. The Brutes, whom Nature did in Sport create, Unknowing of themselves, and of their Fate, By secret Instinct still erect their Eyes To Parent Heaven.— Who then can doubt that Man, the glorious Pride Of All, is nearer to the Skies ally'd? Nature in him an active Soul hath wrought, Hath giv'n him Language, and the Pow'r of Thought: In him the God descends, well pleas'd to find An Image there of his Almighty Mind.— Creech alter'd. Manil. Lib. II. The Brutes, of every kind, dwell on the Earth: Or hang in Air: or thro' the Waters glide: Nor ought but Rest, or Food, or Joys of Sense, Are their Pursuit.—Since, therefore, Speech, to them, And Reason was deny'd, Man was produc'd, To overlook and Rule: Language he has Expressive of his Mind: and various Arts To practise, or invent, a Genius fit. Man o'er the Globe extends his regal Sway: The Soil, by him subdu'd, is forc'd to bear Of Fruits, and Grain, a large and rich Encrease. Wild Beasts are tam'd, and tutor'd for his Use, And o'er the Seas his Vessels plow their Way. He too, alone erect, stands nobly forth, And to the Stars lifts up his starlike Eyes: Beholds the Heav'ns, and Jove himself explores: Nor superficially the Gods to know Is he content: deeply he searches Heav'n, And seeks his Origin among the Stars.— Manil. Lib. IV. What signifies to Man that he from Heav'n His Soul derives, that with erected Front He walks sublime, and views the starry Skies, If, like the Brutes irrational, he acts?— Claudian.— Man (Upright.) See Virtue. That upright Man, who's steady to his Trust, Inflexible to Ill, and obstinately just: The Fury of the Populace defies, And dares the Tyrant's threatning Frowns despise. Not the rough Whirlwind that deforms Adria's black Gulf, and vexes it with Storms, The stubborn Virtue of his Soul can move, Nor even the red Arm of thundring Jove. Should the whole Frame of Nature round him break, In Ruin and Confusion hurl'd, He unconcern'd, would hear the mighty Crack, And stand secure amidst a falling World.— An. alt. Hor. Lib. III. Ode 3. The tow'ring Summit of Olympus knows, Nor raging Hurricanes, nor hoary Snows; But high, in the superior Skies, is seen, Above the Clouds, eternally serene: While, at it's steady Foot, the rushing Rain, And rattling Thunders spend their Force in vain: So, the just Man, disdaining all controul, In perfect Peace preserves his steady Soul: Always himself, Nought can his Virtue move, Nor is he sway'd by Hatred, or by Love.— Claud. de Mallii Theod. Conuls. From Virtue's Laws who never parts Dear Friend, may safely go Without the Moorish Lance or Bow, Or Quiver stor'd with poison'd Darts, The Womb of Woe! Whether thro' Lybia's scorching Land To journey he provides, By savage Caucus' rocky Sides, Or where the Stream, o'er golden Sand, Of Indus glides.— Welsted. Hor. Lib. I. Ode 22. Who's good?—The Man, that in his Country's Cause, Stands up for all her Liberties and Laws.— Hor. Lib. I. Epist. 16. Be a good Soldier, an upright Trustee; An Arbitrator from Corruption free; Or if a Witness in a doubtful Cause, Where a brib'd Judge means to elude the Laws, Tho' Phalaris's brazen Bull were there, And he would dictate what he'd have you swear, Stick firmly to the Truth, and bravely chuse To guard your Honour, tho' your Life You lose. Die, rather than let Virtue be betray'd: Virtue the noblest Cause for which we're made. Improperly we measure Life by Breath: Those do not truly live, who merit Death.— Stepny. Juv. Sat. VIII. Manes. See Funerals. —To Polydore we first perform His Obsequies: a lofty Pile of Earth Is rais'd: and Altars to the Manes built, Mournful with fun'ral Wreaths, and gloomy Boughs Of Cypress: With their Tresses scatter'd loose (Such is th' accustom'd Rite) the Trojan Dames Stand round: We offer Jars of tepid Milk, And frothing Bowls of consecrated Blood: Within the Grave compose his Soul to Rest, Invoke him loud, and take our last Farewel.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. III. —Close in a Grove, Andromache the mournful Off'rings paid, And solemn Sacrifice at Hector's Tomb, His empty Tomb: which, with two Altars built On the green Turf, th' Incentives of her Grief, She consecrated: and with Tears invok'd His Manes.— Id. Ibid. —Æneas summons his assembled Friends, And thus bespeaks them from a rising Ground: Ye gen'rous Trojans! sprung from Blood divine: One yearly Circle is by rolling Months Compleat, since in the Grave we laid to Rest The mortal Relicks of my godlike Sire, And consecrated Fun'ral Altars rais'd. And now That Day, if I remember right, Is come, by me (so You, ye Gods, decreed) For ever honour'd, and for ever mourn'd. This Day, did I on Lybia's barren Sands In Exile live, or on the Grecian Sea Detain'd, or in Mycenæ: annual Vows Ev'n then I would perform, and solemn Pomps, And on his Altars pile th' Oblations due. Now to my Father's Self, his Bones, and Dust (Not without Providence, and Heav'n's Design, As I suppose,) we come, and enter safe These friendly Ports. Come on then, let Us all Honour this Festival with Joy, implore From him propitious Winds, and Leave to pay These annual Oblations.— He said: and with his Mother's Myrtle Wreath His Temples crowns. Directly to the Tomb He from th' Assembly goes, by Thousands round Attended. For Libation here he pours Two Bowls of Wine, unmix'd, upon the Ground, Two of warm Milk, and two of Holy Blood: Then scatters purple Flow'rs, and Thus he speaks. Hail sacred Sire! Again, Ye Ashes, hail; In vain revisited! and Thou, the Ghost Of him who gave me Birth! Five Sheep, obsequious to th' accustom'd Rite, He sacrifices: next, as many Sows, And Heifers black: then pours the Wine from Bowls, Invoking great Anchises' Soul, dismiss'd From Acheron. Nor less his Friends, as each With Store was furnish'd, offer Gifts, and load The Altars, sacrificing Oxen slain: Others in order Cauldrons fix: and, stretch'd Along the Grass, o'er Heaps of burning Coals Place Spits, and fry the Entrails on the Fire.— Idem. Virg. Æn. Lib. V. Hither in Throngs they crowded to the Bank: Matrons, and Men, Souls of brave Heroes dead, Boys, and unmarried Girls, and Youths consum'd On Fun'ral Piles before their Parents Eyes. Unnumber'd, as the Leaves, which fall in Woods, By Autumn's first sharp Blasts: Or as the Birds Which flock from Sea to Land, when the cold Year Drives them beyond Sea, seeking warmer Climes. Praying they stood, first to be wafted o'er: And, longing for the farther Bank, their Hands Extended: But the surly Boatman, deaf To all their Cries, now These, now Those receives: But drives the rest at distance from the Beach. Æneas, (for that Tumult much surpriz'd, And struck his Soul) thus speaks: O sacred Maid! Tell me, what means this Concourse to the Lake? What do the Ghosts desire? And why distinct Leave These the Banks, while Others sweep with Oars The livid Ford?—To Him in brief replies The aged Priestess:—You see Profound Cocytus, and the Stygian Pool: Whose Deity the Gods by Oaths revere, And dread to violate. This Crowd is All Distress'd, and unintomb'd: That Ferryman Is Charon; Those who sail the Lake, interr'd. But 'tis not giv'n to pass the horrid Banks, And hoarse resounding fluent: till in Graves Their Bones are laid: An hundred Years they rove, And flutter round these Shores, and then at length Admitted, to the wish'd for Stream return.— Id. Virg. Æn. Lib. VI. Soon as Cornelia reach'd the friendly Strand, Pompey's last Rites employ her pious Hand: To his dear Shade she builds a fun'ral Pile, And decks it proud with many a noble Spoil. There shone his Arms, with antick Gold inlaid, There the rich Robes which she herself had made: Robes to imperial Jove in Triumph thrice display'd: The Relicks of his past victorious Days, Now this his latest Trophy serve to raise, And in one common Flame together blaze, Such was the weeping Matron's pious Care: The Soldiers, taught by her, their Fires prepare: To ev'ry valiant Friend, a Pile they build, That fell for Rome in curs'd Pharsalia's Field: Stretch'd wide along the Shores, the Flames extend, And grateful to the wandring Shades, ascend.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. IX. Manners. See Dress. The Antient's Manners other Men may please, Not me; thank Heav'n I'm born in Days like these! Not because Gold now from the Mines is brought, And distant Shores for Orient Pearls are sought: Nor for, that Hills exhaust their Marble Veins, And Moles are made, whose Bulk the Sea restrains: But that the World is civiliz'd of late, And polish'd from the Rust of antient Date.— Congreve. Ovid. Art. Am. Lib. III. First, learn good Manners, Fair Ones! I advise: 'Tis that secures the Conquest of your Eyes. Age, Beauty's Foe, will, o'er your charming Brow, Do all you can, injurious Furrows plow: The Time will come you'll hate the Tell-tale Glass, That shews the frightful Ruins of your Face: But, if Good-Nature to the last remain, Ev'n Age will please, and Love his Pow'r retain.— Ovid. de Med. Faciei. Let no rude Passions in your Looks find place, For Fury will deform the finest Face.— Ovid. Art. Am. Let Looks with Looks, and Smiles with Smiles be paid: And when Another bows, incline your Head.— Dryden. Ibid. Manners unseemly, Actions base and vile, Much worse than Dirt the finest Dress defile: But whoso acts with Truth and Honesty, Commands Esteem, tho' mean his Habit be.— Plaut. Marriage. See Wedding. Her Father seal'd my Hopes with Rites divine: Her firmer Love before had made her mine. Men call'd me blest, and blest Cephalus. I was indeed.— What pleasing Images Remembrance draws Of those fair Days, when new to Hymen's Laws, I with my Procris led the Spring of Life, The happiest Husband and the happiest Wife! So high the Tide of our Affection run, Our Love, our Care, our Passions all were one. Had Jove made Love, great Jove she had despis'd, And I my Procris more than Venus priz'd: Love had to both so just a Portion dealt, Such equal Flames our mutual Bosoms felt.— Tate alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. VII. —Within this humble Cot Old Baucis and Philemon led their Life: Both equal-ag'd:—In this their Youth they spent, In this grew old: rich only in Content. With chearful Minds their Poverty they bore, Nor aim'd at Wealth, professing to be poor. For Master, or for Servant, here to call, Was all alike, where only two were All. Command was none, where equal Love was paid: Or rather, both commanded, both obey'd.— Dryd. alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. VIII. Thrice happy They, who long as Life, Without Complainings, Noise, or Strife, Preserve unloos'd the nuptial Tye, Nor cease to Love until they die.— Hor. I. Ode 13. Oh! how I wish that Love, with flutt'ring Wing, The golden Marriage Chains would hither bring! Chains which for ever bind, tho' Age comes on, With Wrinkles, and grey Hairs, and Beauty's Charms be gone.— Tibul. Lib. II. El. 2. Perpetual Concord bless their nuptial State, And Love and Union make their Joys compleat! May She love him in Age, and He behold Her, tho' in Years, yet not believe her old!— Anon. Mart. Mediocrity. See Happiness. Nature requires little. Believe me, Friend! 'tis much the safest Way, Nor with too bold a Sail to trust the Sea: Nor, while you dread the threatning Tempest's roar, Too close to creep along the rocky Shore. Who shuns Extreams, and wisely steers between; Whose equal Mind approves the golden Mean: That happy Man shall spend his Days secure, From the Contempt, and Want that gall the Poor: Secure from splendid Cares, and Envy's Stings, Th' insidious Plague of Courts, and Scourge of Kings. Th' ambitious Winds with greater Spite combine, To shock the Grandeur of the stately Pine: The Height of Structure makes the Ruin large, And Clouds against high Hills their hottest Bolts discharge. An even well-pois'd Mind, an evil State With Hope, a Good with Fear, doth moderate. The Summer's Pride by Winter is brought down, And Flowers again the conquering Season crown. Take Heart, nor of the Laws of Fate complain, Tho' now 'tis cloudy, 'twill clear up again: The Bow Apollo does not always use, But with his milder Lyre sometimes awakes the Muse. When adverse Tides retard your destin'd Course, With lab'ring Oars oppose their surging Force: But if with prosp'rous Gales your Streamers play, Wisely contract the Sails, and scud away.— Norris alter'd. Hor. Lib. II. Ode 10. A City Mouse, (for so does Story tell,) His good old Friend— A Country Mouse receiv'd in his poor Cell. This Mouse was thrifty, yet would kindly feast When Time requir'd, and nobly treat his Guest. In short, now striving every Way to please, He freely brought his hoarded Oats and Pease, His nibbled Bacon, and his mellow Pears, Whate'er the Fields produce, or Country bears: His Nuts, his Grapes well dry'd; and try'd his best, By choice Variety to please the Guest: Who sat as if afraid to hurt his Mouth, And nibbl'd here and there with dainty Tooth. The Landlord only Tares or Barley eats, (Whilst on a Heap of new-thresh'd Chaff he sits) Leaving his Guest the more delicious Meats. At last, the City Mouse begins, My Friend, How can you bear in Woods your Days to spend? Would you not rather live in Town than here, And Men's Converse to that of Beasts prefer? Then go with me: I'll get you better Chear. Since every Creature must resign it's Breath, Nor Great, nor Little, is exempt from Death, Enjoy your Time in Pleasure, Mirth and Sport, And live like one that knows his Life is short. These Words prevail'd upon the Country Mouse, Who strait consents, and jocund leaves the House. The Travellers together journey on, And steal by Night unseen into the Town. Twelve strikes the Clock: the Friends together come To a Lord's House, and find a stately Room, Where purple Cushions grac'd each Ivory Seat, And much was left of last Night's costly Treat. The City Mouse first seats his Country Guest On Cloth of State, and waits, and carves the Feast: Course after Course, a thousand dainty Things, And like a Servant, tastes what-e'er he brings. The Country Mouse, pleas'd with his Seat of State, And various Dainties, bless'd his change of Fate: Feeds heartily: when, lo! the Servants come, And Dogs rush in, and bark about the Room. Both start: both leave their Seats with eager Haste: Trembling, for Life they fly, and hardly 'scape at last. Then says the Country Mouse, I plainly see This Kind of Life is not a Life for me: False Joys, adieu: give me the quiet Wood, Where I am safe, tho' Acorns be my Food.— Cowley alt. Hor. Lib. II. Sat. 6. With Care and Trouble great Estates we gain: When got, we keep 'em with more Care and Pain. The rich Licinus' Servants ready stand, Each with a Water-Bucket in his Hand, Keeping a Guard, for fear of Fire, all Night: Yet is Licinus always in a Fright. His curious Statues, Amber-Works, and Plate, Still fresh encreasing Pangs of Mind create. The naked Cynick's Tub ne'er flames:—if broken; 'Tis quickly sodder'd, or a new bespoken. When Alexander first beheld the Face Of the great Cynick, in that narrow Space: His own Condition thus he did lament: How much more happy Thou, who art content To live within this little Hole, than I Who after Empire, that vain Quarry, fly; Grappling with Dangers where-soe'er I roam. While Thou hast conquer'd all the World at Home. Fortune a Goddess is to Fools alone, The Wise are always Masters of their own.— Dryden. Juv. Sat. XIV. O Thou, for ever dear, but now best known; A Friend at Need by my Misfortunes shewn: If on my long Experience thoul't rely, Live to thyself, from Courts and Greatness fly: Live to thyself; by Virtue seek Renown: Avoid the Great: Destruction waits their Frown: Nor all the Wealth and Pow'r they can bestow, Deserve the Risque with them we undergo. In Storms with lower'd Sails the Port we gain; The Shrouds full spread would drown us in the Main. See the light Cork above the Surface rise: The Net, with all its Weights, sunk, at the Bottom lies.— Ov. III. Trist. 4. Grant me, Ye Gods! a Life of Ease, Toss'd on the rough Ægœan Seas, The Sailor cries, when Darkness hides The Moon, and every Star that guides. For Ease the furious Thracian fights, 'Tis Ease the Mede to War excites; Ease wish'd by all, which can't be sold For Robes of State, or Gems, or Gold. Nor Wealth, nor regal Pomp, we find Can quell the Tumults of the Mind: Or drive away the Cares that wait Around the Palace of the Great. Happy the Man with little blest, Of what his Father left possess'd, Whose sweet Repose no Terrors break, Nor Avarice can keep awake. Since fleeting Life so soon must end, What can our vain Pursuits intend? From Shore to Shore why should we roam, When none can leave himself at home? Tho' under Sail, malicious Care Climbs the tall Ship, and takes us there: Pursues the Horseman close behind, The Stag out-runs, out-flies the Wind. The Mind that can rejoyce to Day, Should cast all future Cares away, And temper Grief with laughing Mirth, For none's compleatly blest on Earth. Achilles great in youthful Pride, Worn out by Age Tithonus dy'd: And Years, which Fate denies to Thee, It may perhaps allow to Me. Ten thousand Sheep o'er-spread thy Ground, Thy num'rous Heifers low around: Four pamper'd Mares thy Chariot draw, Thy purple Robes the Vulgar awe: Of small Extent, an humble Farm, A Breast the Muses gently warm, On me hath gracious Heav'n bestow'd, With Pride enough to scorn the Crowd.— Hor. Lib. II. Od. 16. Climb at Court for me that will, Tottering Favour's Pinnacle! All I seek is to lie still. Settled in some secret Nest, In calm Leisure let me rest: And far off the public Stage, Pass away my silent Age! Thus when, without Noise, unknown, I have liv'd out all my Span, I shall die without a Groan, An old honest Country-man. Who, expos'd to other's Eyes, Into his own Heart ne'er pries, Death's to him a strange Surprize.— Marvel. Sen. Thyestes. [The foregoing Passage is so finely paraphras'd by my Lord Lansdown, that adding it here can need no Apology.] Place me, Ye Powers! in some obscure Retreat: O keep me innocent! make Others Great! In quiet Shades, content with rural Sports, Give me a Life, remote from guilty Courts: Where free from Hopes or Fears, in humble Ease, Unheard of I may live, and die in Peace! Happy the Man who thus retir'd from Sight, Studies himself, and seeks no other Light: But most unhappy he, who sits on high, Expos'd to ev'ry Tongue, and ev'ry Eye: Whose Follies, blaz'd about, to all are known, And are a Secret to himself alone: Worse is an evil Fame, much worse than none. Mercury. —Preparing to obey His mighty Father's Will, first to his Feet He binds the golden Sandals, which on Wings Bear him aloft, as o'er the Seas, or Earth He flies, and round him whirls the rapid Air. Then takes his Wand:—With This pale Ghosts he calls From Hell: sends Others to those dreary Realms: Gives, or breaks Sleep: and Eyes unseals from Death. Equip'd with This, he drives the Winds, and cuts Th' opposing turbid Mists: and now discerns, In his swift Flight, the Top, and lofty Sides Of rocky Atlas, who sustains the Sky. Here first Cyllenius, pois'd on even Wings, Alighted: Thence with all his Body's Force, Flings himself headlong from the steepy Height Down to the Ocean: Like the Bird that flies, Low, skimming o'er the Surface, near the Sea, Around the Shores, around the fishy Rocks: So Mercury in Air 'twixt Earth and Heav'n, Shooting from his maternal Gransire, flew, And cut the Winds, and Lybia's sandy Shore.— Trap. Æn. Lib. IV. With all his Harness soon the God was sped, His flying Hat was fast'ned on his Head, Wings on his Heels were hung, and in his Hand He holds his snaky Sleep-producing Wand. Then darting from the Skies, his Pinions sound, And, in an Instant, shoot him on the Ground.— Dryd. alt. Ovid. Met. Lib. I. Hermes she fir'd, as in the Clouds he hung: So the cold Bullet, that with Fury slung, From Balearic Engines mounts on high, Glows in the Whirl, and burns along the Sky. Now down to Earth he turn'd his Flight, and show'd The Form divine, the Features of a God. He knew their Virtue o'er a female Heart, And yet he strives to better them by Art. He hangs his Mantle loose, and sets to Show The golden Edging on the Seam below: Adjusts his flowing Curls, and in his Hand Waves with an Air, the Sleep-commanding Wand: The glitt'ring Sandals to his Feet applies, And to each Heel the well-trim'd Pinion tyes.— Addison. Ovid. Met. Lib. II. Hermes obeys, and to his Feet applies Those golden Wings that cut the yielding Skies: His ample Hat his beamy Locks o'er-spread, And veil'd the starry Glories of his Head: He seiz'd his Wand, that causes Sleep to fly, Or in soft Slumbers seals the wakeful Eye: That drives the Dead to dark Tartarean Coasts, Or back to Life compels the wand'ring Ghosts. Thus, thro' the parting Clouds the Son of May, Wings on the whistling Winds his rapid Way: Now smoothly steers thro' Air his equal Flight, Now springs aloft, and tow'rs th' etherial Height: Then wheeling down the Steep of Heav'n he flies, And draws a radiant Circle o'er the Skies.— Pope. Stat. Lib. I. Now Maia's Son Pluto. he cites: with ready Speed The God obeys, his Wings adorn his Head: He shakes the Virtue of the sleepy Wand, And hastens to receive the high Command. Offspring of Atlas, and my Nephew dear, Of Hell and Heav'n the common Messenger: Who canst alone appear in either Court, Free of both Worlds, which own thy glad Resort: Wing on the rapid Winds thy Flight above, And bear my Message to the haughty Jove. Scarce had he spoke, when, with dispatchful Flight, The sacred Envoy gain'd the Realms of Light.— Hughes. Claud. Rapt. Pros. Lib. I. Metals. Then Brass, and Gold, and Iron too were shewn, And Silver's valu'd Weight, and Lead were known: When mighty Forests, first, on Mountains high, Fierce Fires consum'd:—Or, kindled from the Sky By Lightning, or from Man the Flames arose, Who thought by Fire to scare his rustic Foes: From whate'er Cause the Flames receiv'd their Birth, With horrid Cracklings, to their deepest Roots, They burnt the Forests up, and scorch'd the Earth. Then Streams of Silver, Gold, and Lead, and Brass, To where they found prepar'd a hollow Place, Ran melted down, and form'd a glitt'ring Mass. Soon as Mankind beheld the sparkling Ore, Pleas'd with its Shine, each Hollow they explore: And there observing, that it shew'd the Frame And Figure of the Place from whence it came, They judg'd, that run by Heat, 'twou'd take with Ease, Whatever useful Shape or Form they please. They found that Blows would to the Metal give Sharp Points for Darts, or a keen Edge to cleave Their Forest Trees: they likewise found it fit For Tools, to knock, or chop, or pierce, or split, To smooth, or hollow Wood, as they should manage it. Silver and Gold no less at first were sought, Than firmer Brass: till by Experience taught, Men found their Strength unequal to the Task, And yielding to the Force such Labours ask: Then Brass became esteem'd, and chiefly priz'd, And Gold was for its blunted Edge despis'd.— Now Brass is look'd on as a Thing of Nought; And Gold has all the Praise and Honour got. Time alters thus the Dignity of Things; Some that were long esteem'd and sought, it flings Down into low Contempt: makes Others priz'd, Which lay for Ages useless and despis'd.— Lucret. Lib. V. The Use of Brass e'er that of Steel was found, Because 'twas softer, and did more abound: Then Ploughs were Brass, and Trumpets heard afar Were Brass, and Brass their Weapons for the War. Till, by Degrees, oft melting down the Mass, Steel Swords were forg'd, which made them scorn the Brass: They then began with Steel to cut the Ground, And in their Wars steel Weapons gave the Wound.— Ibid. Then greedy Mortals, rummaging her Store, Dug from Earth's Entrails first the precious Ore, (Which next to Hell the prudent Gods had laid) And that alluring Ill to Sight display'd. Then cursed Steel, and more accursed Gold, Gave Mischief Birth, and made that Mischief bold, And double Death did wretched Man invade, By Steel assaulted, and by Gold betray'd.— Dryden. Ovid. Met. Lib. I. Midas. To him the Bacchus to Midas. God:— Wish what Thou wilt, and all thy Wish enjoy. A gen'rous Offer! tho' but ill bestow'd On One whose Choice so wrong a Judgment show'd. Grant me, says he, (nor thought he ask'd too much) That with my Body whatsoe'er I touch, Chang'd from the Nature which it held of old, May be converted into yellow Gold, He had his Wish: but yet the God repin'd, To think the Fool no better Wish could find. In Thought compleatly blest, he leaves the Place, With Smiles of Gladness sparkling in his Face: Nor could contain, but, as he took his Way, Impatient, longs to make the first Essay. Down from a lowly Branch a Twig he drew, The Twig strait glitter'd with a golden Hue. He takes a Stone: the Stone was turn'd to Gold: A Clod he touches: and the crumbling Mold Acknowledg'd soon the transmutating Power, In Weight and Substance a rich Lump of Ore. He pluck'd the Corn: and strait his Grasp appears Fill'd with a bending Tuft of golden Ears. An Apple next he takes: and seems to hold The bright Hesperian vegetable Gold. His Hand he careless on a Pillar lays: With shining Gold the Pillar seems to blaze: And while he washes, as the Servants pour, His Touch converts the Stream to Danae's Show'r. To see these Miracles so finely wrought, Fires with transporting Joy his giddy Thought. The ready Slaves prepare a sumptuous Board, Spread with rich Dainties for their happy Lord: Whose pow'rful Hands the Bread no sooner hold, But its whole Substance is transform'd to Gold. Up to his Mouth he lifts the sav'ry Meat, Which turns to Gold as he attempts to eat: His Patron's noble Juice! of purple Hue, Touch'd by his Lips, a gilded Cordial grew: Unfit for drink, and wondrous to behold, It trickles from his Jaws a fluid Gold. The rich poor Fool, confounded with Surprize, Starving in all his various Plenty lies: Sick of his Wish, he now detests the Pow'r, For which he ask'd so earnestly before: Amidst his Gold with pinching Famine curst, And justly tortur'd with an equal Thirst. At last his shining Arms to Heav'n he rears, And in Distress, for Refuge, flies to Pray'rs. O, Father Bacchus! I have sinn'd! he cry'd, And foolishly thy gracious Gift apply'd! Thy Pity now, repenting, I implore! Oh! may I feel the golden Plague no more! The hungry Wretch, his Folly thus confest, Touch'd the kind Deities good-natur'd Breast: The gentle God annull'd his first Decree, And from the cruel Compact set him free.— Croxall. Ovid. Met. Lib. XI. Milky Way. A way there is, extending far on high, Clear to the View in an unclouded Sky; The Place, for it's distinguish'd Whiteness fam'd, By Men below the Milky Way is nam'd. The bright Immortals tread this heav'nly Road To Jove's high Court, the Thunderer's Abode.— Sewell alt. Ovid. Met. Lib. I. Nor with enquiring Eyes need we survey The distant Skies, to find the Milky Way: By All it must be seen: for, ev'ry Night, It forcibly intrudes upon the Sight, And will be mark'd: there shining Streaks adorn The Skies, as op'ning to let forth the Morn: Or, as a beaten Path, that spreads between A trodden Meadow, and divides the Green: Or, as when Seas are plow'd, behind the Ship White Foam rolls o'er the Surface of the Deep. In Heav'n's dark Arch this Way distinguish'd lies, And with it's Brightness parts the azure Skies. Fame says, (nor shall with me the Fable die,) That Juno's Breast, o'erflowing, stain'd the Sky, And left that Whiteness: whence it justly draws The Name of Milky from the Milky Cause.— Creech alt. Manil. L. I. Minerva. Pallas. High on her Helmet, menacing before, The horrid Typhon's Form Minerva bore: Tho' slain above, below the Monster lives, Dies in this Part, and in this Part survives. Pointed with polish'd Steel, her weighty Spear, Rose like a lofty Beam, erect in Air: Whilst o'er her Shield, which bore the Gorgon's Head, With friendly Care her shining Robe she spread.— Hughes. Claud. Rapt. Pros. II. —They carve in Gold, With Scales of Serpents, angry Pallas' Shield, The dreadful Ægis: and the twisted Snakes, And in the Goddess' Breast the Gorgon's Head, Turning it's Eyes, and terrible in Death.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. VIII. 'Twas now the Feast when each Athenian Maid Her yearly Homage to Minerva paid: In Canisters, with Garlands cover'd o'er, High on their Heads their mystic Gifts they bore.— Addis. Ovid. Met. Lib. II. Herself she blazons with a glitt'ring Spear, And crested Helm that veil'd her braided Hair, And Shield, and Breast Plate, Implements of War. Struck with her pointed Lance, the teeming Earth Seem'd to produce a new surprizing Birth: When, from the Glebe, the Pledge of Conquest sprung, A Tree, pale-green, with fairest Olives hung.— Croxall. Ovid. Met. L. VI. Miser. See Avarice. Midas. How are the Covetous than Slaves more free, That basely stoop for ev'ry Pin they see; I can't imagine: He that still doth crave, Must fear: and he that fears must be a Slave.— Creech. Hor. Lib. I. Epist. 16. Poor thirsty Tantalus, alas! in vain, Essays to drink; his Lips the Stream eludes.— What! dost Thou laugh?—but only change the Name, Of Thee the Story's told: who, sleepless, brood'st O'er thy full Bags, and gaping still for more, Ne'er touchest what Thou hast; as to the Gods 'Twere consecrate, or only pictur'd Gold. Dost Thou not know the Good, the Use of Wealth? 'Twill buy thee Bread, or Herbs, a Pint of Wine, Or any Thing that Nature's Wants require. But, Day and Night to be an anxious Wretch, Always upon the Guard, in fear of Thieves, And Fire, and Servants that may pilfer from Thee:— Is this the Good of Wealth?—If so it be, Then grant, kind Heav'n! I may be ever poor!— Hor. Lib. I. Sat. I. Say, dost thou know Vectidius?—Who, the Wretch Whose Lands beyond the Sabines largely stretch: A Length of Country, which a sailing Kite Can scarce fly over in a Day and Night? Him dost thou mean, who spight of all his Store, Is ever craving, and will still be poor: Born with the Curse and Anger of the Gods, And hated by the Genius he defrauds? At Harvest-home, and on the Sheering Day, When he should Thanks to Pan and Pales pay, And better Ceres: trembling to approach The little Barrel, which he fears to broach: H' essays the Wimble, draws it often back, And deals to thirsty Servants but a Smack. To a short Meal he makes a tedious Grace, Before the Barley-Pudding comes in place: Then bids fall on:—himself, for saving Charges, A peel'd slic'd Onion eats, and tipples Verjuice.— Dryden. Pers. Sat. IV. Unhappy Tantalus, amidst the Flood, Where floating Apples on the Surface stood, Eager pursues them with a longing Eye, Yet can nor Thirst, nor Hunger satisfy. Such is the Miser's Fate, who curs'd with Wealth, Amidst his endless Treasure starves himself.— Petron. Arb. Opimius, (who amidst his shining Store Was still in Want, and miserably poor, Who on Feast Days did wretch'd Wine provide In earthen Jugs, and Lees on all beside:) Lay in a Lethargy: all Hope was gone; And now his joyful Heir ran up and down, And seiz'd the Keys, and Chests, as all his own. A friendly Doctor came, and this Design He us'd for Cure: he brought a Table in, And order'd some to tumble o'er his Coin. This rouz'd him:—Then he cries, Sir, you're undone: Wake, Sir, and watch; or else your Money's gone: Your Heir will seize it. What, while I'm alive? Then wake and show it, Sir: Come, come revive. What must I do? Why really, Sir, you'll die, Unless your Strength you instantly supply With proper Food: Eat, Sir: What! are you loth? Pray take this little Mess of Barly-Broth. What does it cost? Not much, upon my Word. How much pray? Why, two Groats. Two Groats! Oh Lord! 'Tis the same Thing to me to be undone By Sickness, Thieves, or Physick: I'll have none.— Creech alt. Hor. Lib. II. Sat. 3. Money. Riches. Wealth. Gold is the greatest God: tho' yet we see No Temples rais'd to Money's Majesty, No Altars fuming to her Pow'r divine, Such as to Valour, Peace and Virtue shine, And Faith, and Concord.— Dryden. Juv. Sat. I. Wouldst thou live well? who'd not? then quickly strive, And now since Virtue only this can give, Leave all thy false Delights, and that pursue.— But if the wild Opinion You approve, That Words make Virtue, just as Trees a Grove: Then get one thousand Talents, then one more, And then another, and then square the Store: For by this Empress Wealth is all bestow'd, A rich and honest Wife, and ev'ry Good, Beauty, and Friends, and Nobleness of Blood. The rich and moneyed Man hath ev'ry Grace, Persuasion in his Tongue, and Venus in his Face.— Creech alter'd. Hor. Lib. I. Epist. 6. The Saying's true, and hath been often told, Gold excells Silver, heav'nly Virtue Gold.— O Romans! Romans! Gold must first be sought, Then Virtue: that's but worth a second Thought. This is the Tune of ev'ry trading Fool: Old Men, and ev'ry Boy, repeats this Rule, That with his Books and Satchel goes to School.— Creech. Hor. Lib. I. Epist. 1. Whoe'er is wealthy, may securely sail, For as he wills kind Fortune gives the Gale: May Danae wed, and rival am'rous Jove, Nay make her Acrisius. Father Pander to his Love: May be a Poet, Preacher, Lawyer too, By bawling win the Cause he does not know, And beyond Cato's Fame for Wisdom go. To Wealth, the Judge, obedient, gives the Cause, And, as thou pay'st him, turns and winds the Laws: Acquire but Riches, and when that is done, Be whom Thou wilt, Somers, or Littleton. Gold governs all: get that, and Thou mayst have Whate'er thy most unbounded Wishes crave: In short, whoever is of that possest, Has Jove himself inclos'd within his Chest.— Petron. Arb. Nor House, nor Lands, nor Heaps of Plate, or Gold, Can cure a Fever's Heat, or Ague's Cold, Or free the Mind from Cares. He must have Health, He must be well, that would enjoy his Wealth. Whoe'er desires, or fears, diseas'd in Mind, Wealth profits him as Pictures do the Blind, Plaisters the gouty Feet, or Musick's Airs And charming Sounds, the stuft and aking Ears.— Creech alter'd. Hor. Lib. I. Epist. 2. O You immortal Gods! what signifies this Money?— Plaut. Aul. Moon. Not equal Light th' unequal Moon adorns, Or in her wexing, or her waining Horns: For ev'ry Day she wains her Face is less, But gathering into Globe, she fattens at Increase.— Dryden. Ovid. Met. Lib. XV. The Moon commands the Seas, and drives the Main Far o'er the Shores, then draws it back again: But most her Influence agitates the Streams, When opposite she views her Brother's Beams: Or, when she near in close Conjunction rides, She rears the Flood, and swells the flowing Tides: Or, when attending on his yearly Race, The Equinoctial sees her borrow'd Face.— Creech. Manil. Lib. II. Morning. Lo! from the rosy East her purple Doors The Morn unfolds, adorn'd with blushing Flow'rs: The lessen'd Stars draw off, and disappear, Whose bright Battalions lastly Lucifer. Brings up, and quits his Station in the Rear.— Trap. Ovid. Met. Lib. II. — Now the Day Returning, with the Morning Star arose: And from the Pole Aurora's Dawn dispell'd The dewy Shades.— Idem. Virg. Æn. Lib. III. Now ev'ry Star before Aurora flies, Whose glowing Blushes streak the purple Skies.— Pitt. Æn. Lib. III. Aurora, from Tithonus' Saffron Bed Now rising, sprinkled o'er the World with Light.— Trap. Ibid. And now the Ocean redden'd with the Rays: And in her rosy Car the blushing Morn Shone from the Sky.— Id. Æn. Lib. VII. And now Aurora, Harbinger of Day, Rose from the saffron Bed where Tithon lay; And sprinkled o'er the World with new-born Light: The Sun now shining, all Things brought to Sight.— Æn. Lib. IX. Mean while returning Day roll'd on, And with it's full-born Light dispell'd the Shades.— Trap. Æn. Lib. X. Mean while Aurora, with new rising Light, Restor'd the Cares and Labours of the Day To wretched Mortals.— Id. Æn. Lib. XI. The Morn ensuing from the Mountain's Height, Had scarcely spread the Skies with rosy Light: Th' Etherial Coursers bounding from the Sea, From out their flaming Nostrils breath'd the Day.— Dryd. Æn. Lib. XII. Now Morn begins to dawn: the Sun's bright Fire Gilds the high Mountains.— Ovid. Met. Lib. IX. And now, o'er Ida with an early Ray, Flames the bright Star, that leads the golden Day.— Pitt. Æn. L. II. Mean while Aurora rising leaves the Sea.— Trap. Æn. L. XI. Now thro' Night's Shade the early Dawning broke, And changing Skies the Sun's Approach bespoke: But yet the Morn was dress'd in dusky White, Nor purpled o'er the East with ruddy Light. At length the Pleiads fading Beams gave Way, And dull Bootes languish'd into Day: Each larger Star withdrew his fainting Head, And Lucifer from stronger Phœbus fled.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. II. The Morn had chac'd the dewy Shades away, And o'er the World advanc'd the Lamp of Day.— Pitt. Æn. Lib. IV. The blushing Morn had bid the Stars retreat.— Gay. Ovid. Met. VII. Soon as the Morn, fresh smiling from the East, Had put the Stars to flight.— Æn. Lib. V. The rising Morning Star, with glory bright, Did sluggish Mortals to new Toils invite.— Ovid. Met. Lib. IV. Now shone the Morning Star in bright Array, To vanquish Night, and usher in the Day.— Croxall. Ovid. Met. Lib. VIII. Now Day's bright Beams the various Earth disclose, And o'er the fading Stars the Sun arose.— Rowe. Lucan. L. VIII. Aurora rising from old Tithon's Bed, Does o'er the Eastern Skies her Roses spread. Stay, beauteous Morning! whither dost Thou haste? Why dost Thou drive thy Chariot on so fast? Folded I lie in my dear Mistress' Arms, And all her Soul is mine, and all her Charms. I now am to her panting Bosom press'd, And now, if ever Lover was, am bless'd. As yet sweet Sleep sits heavy on our Eyes, And chilling Dews, and Birds forbid to rise. Stay, beauteous Morning! for to Lovesick Maids, And happy Youths, how grateful are these Shades! Ah stay! and do not from the blushing East, With dawning Glories break our balmy Rest! When Night's black Mantle does those Glories hide, The Pilot by the Stars his Ship can guide: And in mid-Sea a certain Course pursue, As safe, as when he has thy Sun in view. Thou dost the weary Traveller awake: Tho' to the Down his heavy Head inclines, Up he must lift it, for the Morning shines. The Soldier braces on his brazen Shield, Quits his warm Tent, and fits him for the Field. The lab'ring Hind his Harrow takes, or now Yokes the reluctant Oxen to the Plow. The Boy half wak'd, and rubbing still his Eyes, Is loath alike to go to School, or rise: While o'er his Task, he does imperfect, nod, He fears the Ferula, and dreads the Rod. The Bridegroom starting from his Bride's Embrace Runs to the Lawyer to consult his Case: A Word is wanting in the Marriage-Deed, And what, to save the Portion, must he plead? Now hungry Serjeants quit their tempting Ease, To haunt the crowded Courts, and pick up Fees, Thy Rise brings Labour to the Female Band, And puts the Spindle in the Spinster's Hand. Light are these Toils, and little is the Pain To rise to work, and rest at Night again: But who, that knows Love's dear transporting Joys, Can from the Arms of Beauty bear to rise?— Anon. alter'd. Ovid. Amor. Lib. I. El. 13. Soon as Aurora ushers in the Morn, And o'er the World displays the dawning Day: When Birds of various Kinds fly thro' the Groves, And with their warbling Musick fill the Skies: How swiftly then, o'er ev'ry Thing alike, The rising Sun pours forth his glorious Ray, Is known full well, and manifest to All.— Lucret. Lib. II. Mountain. Stiff with Eternal Ice, and hid in Snow, That fell a thousand Centuries agoe, The Mountain stands: nor can the rising Sun Unfix her Frosts, and teach them how to run. Deep, as the dark Infernal Waters lie, From the bright Regions of the chearful Sky, So far the proud ascending The Alps. Rocks invade Heav'n's upper Realms, and cast a dreadful Shade: No Spring, nor Summer, on the Mountain seen, Smiles with gay Fruits, or with delightful Green; But hoary Winter, unadorn'd, and bare, Dwells in the dire Retreat, and freezes there. There she assembles all her blackest Storms, And the rude Hail in rattling Tempests forms: Thither the loud tumultuous Winds resort, And on the Mountain keep their boist'rous Court, That in thick Show'rs her rocky Summit shrowds, And darkens all the broken View with Clouds.— Addison. Sil. Ital. Lib. III. From Steep to Steep the Troops advanc'd with Pain, In hopes at last the topmost Cliff to gain: But still by new Ascents the Mountain grew, And a fresh Toil presented to their View.— Id. Ibid. Mourning for the Dead. See Grief. Lamentation. Stretch'd on the Floor the wretched Father lies: His hoary Hair, and wrinkled Cheeks, besmears, And Heav'n upbraids, that gave him length of Years. Had I an hundred Tongues, a Wit so large, As could their hundred Offices discharge: Had Phœbus all his Helicon bestow'd, In all the Streams inspiring all the God: Those Tongues, that Wit, those Streams, that God, in vain. Would offer to describe his Sister's Pain. Their Breasts they beat with many a bruising Blow, Till they turn livid, and defile the Snow. The Corpse they cherish, while the Corpse remains, And fondly chafe with unavailing Pains; And when to fun'ral Flames 'tis borne away, They kiss the Bed on which the Body lay. And when those fun'ral Flames no longer burn, (The Dust compos'd within a pious Urn) Ev'n in that Urn their Brother they confess, And hug it in their Arms, and to their Bosom press. His Tomb is rais'd: then stretch'd along the Ground, Those living Monuments his Tomb surround: Ev'n to his Name, inscrib'd, their Tears they pay, And Kisses almost wear his Name away.— Dryden. Ovid. Met. Lib. VIII. But King Evander by no friendly Force Could be restrain'd: Distracted thro' the Midst He rushes, falls on Pallas' breathless Corpse Stretch'd on the standing Bier, and clinging close Hugs him with Groans and Tears: At length his Words, Long choak'd with Grief, a painful Passage found. Not such, O Pallas! was thy Promise giv'n To thy unhappy Sire: that with Reserve, And Caution, thou would'st trust the bloody Field. O dire First-Fruits of War!—ill-fated Youth!— Mournful Beginnings!—and my Pray'rs and Vows Unheard by all the Powers divine!—And Thou, Celestial Saint, dear Partner of my Bed, Bless'd in thy Death! nor to this Woe reserv'd! I by a disproportion'd Length of Life Usurp on Nature, and survive my Son.— Trap. Æn. Lib. XI. —With Dust he soils His hoary Hair, and stretches both his Hands To Heav'n: and clinging hugs the bloody Coarse.— Id. Æn. Lib. X. So when some gen'rous Youth resigns his Breath, And parting sinks in the last Pangs of Death; With ghastly Eyes, and many a lift-up Hand, Around his Bed the still Attendants stand: No Tongue as yet presumes his Fate to tell, Nor speaks aloud the solemn last Farewell. As yet the Mother by her Darling lies, Nor breaks, lamenting, into frantic Cries: And tho' he stiffens in her fond Embrace, His Eyes are set, and deadly pale his Face, Horror a while prevents the swelling Tear: Nor is her Passion Grief, as yet, but Fear. In one fix'd Posture motionless she keeps, And wonders at her Woe before she weeps.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. II. But why should Tombs be built, or Urns be made? Does Grief like mine require their feeble Aid? Is he not lodg'd, poor Wretch! within thy Heart, And fix'd in every dearest vital Part? O'er Monuments surviving Wives may grieve, She ne'er will need them, who disdains to live.— Id. Lucan. Lib. IX. Mourning (Public.) Proud Calydon is overwhelm'd with Woe, And Tears from Young and Old unbounded flow: All Ranks alike excessive Sorrow show. Their Breasts the rev'rend Matrons beat, and tare With loud Laments, their long dishevell'd Hair.— Ovid. Met. Lib. VIII. —Loud Cries ascend the vaulted Roof: With shrill Laments, with Groans, and female Shrieks The Houses ring: and Wailings fill the Sky.— Trap. Æn. IV. But most of all in King Latinus' Court, And in the royal City, Sorrow reigns, And wildest Consternation: Aged Dames, And hapless Brides, and Sisters drown'd in Tears, And wretched Orphans, curse the wasteful War.— Trap. Æn. Lib. XI. —The royal Maid Lavinia first Her rosy Cheeks, and beauteous Tresses tares: Then all the rest run madding round the Court: And with loud Shrieks the spacious Palace rings. Hence the dire Fame o'er all the City spreads: Their Spirits sink.—Confounded at the Fates, His City's Ruin, and his Consort's Death, With Garments rent, Latinus goes, and all With Dust deforms his hoary ruffled Hair.— Id. Æn. Lib. XII. Mean time the Shores, the Seas, and Skies around, With mournful Cries for Pompey's Death resound. But when the sad Cornelia first appear'd, When on the Deck her sorrowing Head she rear'd, Her Locks hung rudely o'er the Matron's Face, With all the Pomp of Grief's disorder'd Grace: When they beheld her, wasted quite with Woe, And spent with Tears, that never cease to flow, Again they feel their Loss, again complain, And Heav'n and Earth ring with their Cries again.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. IX. Justice suspends her Course in mournful Rome, And all the noisy Courts at once are dumb: No Honours shine in the distinguish'd Weed, Nor Rods the purple Magistrate preceed. The Matrons sad, their rich Attire lay by, And to the Temples madly crouding fly: Some on the Shrines their gushing Sorrows pour, Some dash their Breasts against the marble Floor: Some on the sacred Thresholds rend their Hair, And seek the Gods with Cries instead of Pray'r. Nor Jove receiv'd the mournful Suppliants all, In ev'ry Fane, on ev'ry Pow'r they call.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. II. Munificence. See Hospitality. Rewards. He, suppliant, in the royal Presence stands, With Boughs of peaceful Olive in his Hands: And begs the King some Town, or Field to give, Where they may safe, his faithful Vassals live. Beneficient, and with a pleasing Look, In Answer, thus the Trachin Monarch spoke: The Wretched to assist I ne'er disdain, Nor over Realms unhospitable reign: All you can wish I grant: Intreaties spare: Whate'er you see, (and wou'd 'twere better!) share.— Croxall alt. Ovid. Met. Lib. XI. When thus the friendly Prophet had foretold, He sent rich Gifts of Elephant, and Gold: Within our Navy's Sides large Treasures stow'd, And brazen Cauldrons, that refulgent glow'd. He sent with these, a glitt'ring Coat of Mail, With many a golden Clasp, and golden Scale: A radiant Helm, whose beauteous Summit bore A waving Plume; the Helm that Pyrrhus wore. My Father too with costly Gifts he loads, And Sailors he supplies to stem the Floods, And gen'rous Steeds, and Arms to all my Train, With skilful Guides to lead us o'er the Main.— Pitt alt. Virg. Æn. Lib. III. Nor less Andromache, with sad Farewell, Brings to Ascanius Robes all wrought in Gold With various Colours, and a Phrygian Cloak: Loads him with rich embroider'd Vestments, nought Inferior in her Presents.— Trap. Ibid. Attending on their Way, the gen'rous Prince Dismiss'd his Guests with rich Munificence; In old Anchises' Hand a Scepter plac'd: A Vest and Quiver young Ascanius grac'd: His Sire, a Cup: which from th' Aonian Coast Ismenian Thyrses sent his royal Host. Nor less Expence the Trojan Gifts express'd: A fuming Censer for the royal Priest; A Chalice, and a Crown of princely Cost, With ruddy Gold and sparkling Gems emboss'd.— Catcott. Ovid. Met. Lib. XIII. Nations Different. In diff'rent Nations diff'rent Men we view, That vary in their Shape, or in their Hue: The Matter's common, and in all the same, But private Stamps distinctly mark the Frame. Large yellow Offspring are the German's Pride, While neighb'ring France with Red is deeply dy'd. Slim are the People that inhabit Spain, The Muscles there a firmer Texture gain. Th' Italians shew a sweet but manly Grace, And temper'd Mars appears in ev'ry Face; But active Greece produceth finer Parts, Their Looks betray their Exercise and Arts. Short curl'd up Hair the Sons of Syria grace: And Blackness stains the Ethiopian's Face: Less India blackens, less deforms the Mass, There blended Colours make a tawny Face, Whilst Egypt's slimy Plains affect the Sight With brighter Colours, and approach to White. Parch'd Lybia burns her Sons: the vilest Shapes She shews, and scarce divides her Men from Apes: While Mauritania doth disgust the Eye, (Her Name bespeaks it,) with the blackest Dye. Tho' Organs form'd alike each Speech employs, What diff'rent Languages confound the Voice! What diff'rent Virtues reign, what diff'rent Crimes? Men's Manners are as various as the Climes.— Creech alt. Manil. Lib. IV. In cold laborious Climes the wintry North Brings her undaunted hardy Warriors forth: In Body and in Mind untaught to yield, Stubborn of Soul, and steady in the Field. But Asia's softer Climate, form'd to please, Dissolves her Sons in Indolence and Ease. Here silken Robes invest enervate Limbs, And in long Trains the flowing Purple streams. Where no rude Hills Sarmatia's Wilds restrain, Nor rushing Tigris cuts the level Plain, Swifter than Winds along the Champian born, The Parthians fly with Ease, or fight, or turn, And distant still the vain Pursuer scorn. Not with like Ease they force their warlike Way, Where rough unequal Grounds their Speed delay. When-e'er the thicker Shades of Night arise, Unaim'd their Shaft, and unavailing, flies: Nor are they form'd with Constancy, to meet Those Toils that make the panting Soldier sweat: To climb the Heights, to stem the rapid Flood, To make the dusty Noon-day Battle good, Horrid in Wounds, and crusted o'er with Blood. Nor Wars Machines they know, nor have the Skill To shake the Rampire, or the Trench to fill: Each Fence that can their winged Shafts endure, Stands, like a Fort impregnable, secure. Light are their Skirmishes, their War is Flight, And still to wheel their wav'ring Troops delight. To taint their coward Darts is all their Care, And then to trust them to the flitting Air: When e'er their Bows have spent the feather'd Store, The mighty Business of their War is o'er. No manly Strokes they try, nor Hand to Hand With cleaving Sword in manly Combat stand. With Swords the Valiant still their Foes invade; These call in Drugs and Poisons to their Aid.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. VIII. Nature Content with Little. See Mediocrity. O wretched Man! in what a Mist of Life, Inclos'd with Dangers, and with noisy Strife, He spends his little Span! and over-feeds His cram'd Desires with more than Nature needs! For Nature wisely stints our Appetite, And craves no more than undisturb'd Delight, Which Minds unmixt with Cares and Fears obtain; A Soul serene, a Body void of Pain. So little this corporeal Frame requires, So bounded are our natural Desires, That wanting all, and setting Pain aside, With bare Privation Sense is satisfy'd.— Dryden. Lucr. Lib. II. Behold! Ye Sons of Luxury, behold! Who scatter in Excess your lavish Gold: You who the Wealth of frugal Ages waste, T' indulge a wanton supercilious Taste: For whom all Earth, all Ocean are explor'd, To spread the various proud voluptuous Board: Behold how little thrifty Nature craves!— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. IV. What-e'er can Nature's real Wants relieve, Th' indulgent Gods with kind Profusion give. The Olive freely yields its wild Repast, And ev'ry Bry'r presents a rural Feast. Mad must he be, who'd thirst beside a Stream, Or freeze, while Phœbus gives his glowing Beam. Around the nuptial Bed arm'd Laws appear: Yet the chaste Bride indulges without Fear. Each useful Blessing bounteous Heav'n bestows; But Pride's insatiate Lust no Limits knows.— Addison junr. Petron. Arb. But Heav'n is kind, with bounteous Hand it grants A fit Supply for Nature's sober Wants: She asks not much, yet Men press blindly on, And heap up more, to be the more undone: By Luxury they Rapine's Force maintain, What that scrapes up, flows out in Luxury again: And to be squander'd at a senseless Rate, Seems now the only Use of an Estate.— Creech alter'd. Manil. Lib. IV. The best and wisest on a little live: Nature to every one does kindly give The Means of Happiness; did Man but know T' enjoy the Blessings which she does bestow. This useful Science did we understand, Man's chief Concern would be to till the Land: War would not rage, nor crashing Forests fall, Storms wreck the Ship, nor Engines break the Wall. Claud. Ruf. Lib. I. Navigation. See Pilot. Sailing. Oak was his Heart, his Breast with Steel Thrice mail'd, that first the brittle Keel Committed to the murd'rous Deep: Nor dreaded battling Winds, that sweep The Flood, the Hyads stormy Train, Nor the fierce South, of Adria's Main The lawless Monarch, be his Will T' enrage the gulfy Wave, or still. All Fear of Death did he repel, Who, fearless, saw the Billows swell: Saw the fell Monsters floating by, And Rocks, deaf to the Seaman's Cry! Vain has Almighty Wisdom plac'd, For Earth's fixt Borne, the watry Waste: If impious Men the Art have found T' o'erleap the inviolable Mound.— Welsted. Hor. Lib. I. Od. 3. Who in a Ship began to plow the Main, And ruffled with rude Oars the watry Plain: Tim'rous at first, the Sea's calm Billows try'd, And row'd, securely, by the Shore's known Side. Then, vent'ring on, thro' wide-stretch'd Bays he sails, And spreads his Canvas to the gentle Gales: At length, by often daring, bolder grown, Scorning the Fears which he before had known, The Deep he takes, Heav'n his sole Guide, and braves Ægean Storms, and the Ionian Waves.— Præf. Rapt. Pros. From thence, e'er yet the Seaman's Art was taught, Rude Argo thro' the Deep a Passage sought: She first explor'd the distant foreign Land, And shew'd her Strangers to the wond'ring Strand: Then Nations Nations knew, in Leagues were join'd, And universal Commerce mix'd Mankind. By her made bold, the daring Race defy'd The Winds tempestuous, and the swelling Tide: Much she enlarg'd Destruction's ample Pow'r, And open'd Ways to Death, unknown before.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. III. The Heav'n instructed Ship-man thus replies: Of all yon Multitude of golden Stars, Which the wide rounding Sphere incessant bears, The cautious Mariner relies on none, But keeps him to the constant Pole alone.— Id. Lucan. Lib. VIII. —Strait the Master veer'd;— The working Waves the Course inverted feel, And dash, and foam, beneath the winding Keel: Not with such Skill, on rapid Chariots born, Around the Column skilful Racers turn: While the near Wheels bear nicely on the Goal, The farther, wide, in distant Circles roll.— Id. Ibid. The cloudy Skies a gathering Storm presage, And Auster from the South began to rage: Full from the Land the sounding Tempest roars, Repels the swelling Surge, and sweeps the Shores. Spight of the Seaman's Toil the Storm prevails: In vain with skilfull Strength he hands the Sails: In vain the cordy Cables bind 'em fast, At once it rips, and rends 'em from the Mast: At once the Winds the flutt'ring Canvas tare, Then whirl, and whisk it, thro' the sportive Air. Some, timely for the rising Rage prepar'd, Furl the loose Sheet, and lash it to the Yard: In vain their Care: sudden the furious Blast Snaps by the Board, and bears away the Mast: Of Tackling, Sails, and Mast, at once bereft, The Ship a naked helpless Hull is left. But, happier some, a steady Course maintain, Who stand far out, and keep the deeper Main: Their Masts they cut, and driving with the Tide, Safe o'er the Surge, beneath the Tempest ride. In vain, did from the southern Coast, their Foe, All black with Clouds, outragious Auster blow; Lowly secure amidst the Waves they lay, Old Ocean heav'd his Back, and roll'd 'em on their Way.— Idem. Lucan. Lib. IX. Neptune. Mean while the Noise and Tumult of the Main Neptune perceives: the Bottom of the Deep Turn'd upwards, and the Storm's licentious Rage. Highly provok'd, and careful for his Realms, Above the Waves, serene, he rears his Head: He sees the Trojan Fleet o'er all the Sea Dispers'd: Æneas, and his Ships o'erpow'r'd With Surges, and the Ruin of the Sky. East and West Winds he hails: and then proceeds:— From your high Birth does this Presumption rise? And dare You thus, without my Sov'reign Leave, Mix Earth, and Heav'n, and such vast Billows raise? Whom I:—But first 'tis fit we should compose The troubled Ocean. For your next Offence A more severe Correction you shall find. Hence, fly: and bear this Message to your King: To Me, not Him, the Empire of the Main, And aweful Trident fell: Huge rocky Caves Are his Dominions: Eurus, your Abodes: Proud in that Palace Æolus may reign, But bid him bar the Prison of his Winds.— So spoke the God: and sooner than he spoke, Appeas'd the tossing of the Waves, dispell'd The Clouds collected, and restor'd the Sun. Cymothoê too, and Triton join their Strength To clear the Vessels from the pointed Rock: Himself his Trident plies, to heave them off, Levels the Banks of Sand, and calms the Sea, And with light Wheels o'er the smooth Surface rides.— Trap. Æn. I. — Father Neptune His wild Sea-Horses joins in Harness, adds The foaming Bridles, and diffuses all The flowing Reins: In his cerulean Car Lightly He skims the Surface of the Deep: The Waves subside: The swelling Sea lies smooth Beneath the thund'ring Axle: And the Clouds Fly from the vast Horizon. Various then The Forms of his Retinue: Monstrous Whales, Old Glaucus' Train, Palemon Ino's Son, The nimble Tritons, and all Phorcus' Band: Thetis, and Melite upon the Left, Niseæ, Spio, and Cymodoce, Thalia, and the Virgin Panopea.— Id. Æn. Lib. V. Nor from his patrimonial Heav'n alone, Is Jove content to pour his Vengeance down: Aid from his Brother of the Sea, he craves, To help him with auxiliary Waves. Neptune the Rivers summons to his Court, To whom, when there obedient they resort, And with their swelling Streams his Palace fill, He thus, in brief, declares his mighty Will. Small Exhortation needs: your Pow'rs employ: And this bad World, so Jove requires, destroy: All Banks, all Lets, all Obstacles remove, At large let all your Floods unbridled rove. Thus charg'd, in haste, their Fountains all set free, Headlong they roll, impetuous, to the Sea. Then, with his Mace he struck: the trembling Earth, Broke up her hidden Springs, and gave a Deluge Birth. The Land and Sea seem'd diff'rent now no more, For all was Sea, but Sea without a Shore.— Dryd. alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. I. Calm grows the Sea, while Neptune lays his Mace O'er the wide Surface of it's furrow'd Face: Already Triton at his Call appears Above the Waves: a purple Robe he wears, And in his Hand a crooked Trumpet bears. The Sov'reign bids him peaceful Sounds inspire, And give the Waves the Signal to retire. His writhen Shell he takes, whose narrow Vent Grows by Degrees into a large Extent, And gives it Breath: The Blast with doubling Sound, Runs the wide Circuit of the World around: From the Sun's Rising to it's Ev'ning Fall, 'Twas heard by ev'ry Wave, and was obey'd by All.— Dryden alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. I. Night. See Enchantress. —The rosy Sun in western Waves (The Day declining) plung'd his weary Car, And brought returning Night.— Trap. Æn. XI. Low in the West the setting Sun was laid, Up rose the Night with glitt'ring Stars array'd, And silver Cynthia cast a lengthning Shade.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. V. Mean while the Hemisphere rolls round, and Night Swift rushes from the Sea: in dusky Shade Involving Earth, and Heav'n.— Trap. Æn. II. Now the descending Sun roll'd down the Light, The Hills lie cover'd in the Shades of Night.— Æn. III. Now Night had shed her silver Dews around, And with her sable Wings embrac'd the Ground.— Dryd. Ibid. And now the dewy Night is hast'ning swift From Heav'n: and setting Stars perswade to Sleep. Trap. Æn. II. The Moon now rising, in her stately Car With Dew besprinkled, did the Sun succeed; And o'er the silent World her Round began. Nor Beast, nor Bird is heard: ev'n carking Care Sleep overcomes; as, nodding, thro' the Skies On Earth it falls, and every where bestows A sweet Forgetfulness of Labours past.— Stat. Theb. Lib. I. 'Twas now the Season, when the first Repose, Sweet Gift of Gods, on weary Mortals creep.— Trap. Ibid. Sunk in the western Ocean was the Day: And dewy Night shed from her azure Car, Repose, and Slumber, o'er the weary World.— Claud. Rapt. Pros. 'Twas Night, when ev'ry Creature void of Cares, The common Gift of balmy Slumber shares.— Dryden. Æn. III. Now Night her Coursers to her Chariot joins, Whilst all the starry shining Train advance, And round their Mother's Wheels in Chorus dance: Then follows silent Sleep, with dusky Wings Involv'd, and fleeting Midnight Visions brings.— Dart. Tibul. Lib. II. El. 1. 'Twas Night, and weary Nature lull'd asleep The Birds, and Beasts, and Fishes of the Deep, And every Creature else.— Dryden. Æn. Lib. VIII. Now was the World forsaken by the Sun, And Phœbe half her nightly Race had run.— Id. Æn. X. —And now the dewy Night Had almost reach'd Heaven's middle Arch.— Trap. Æn. V. Deep Silence reign'd: Arctophylax had driv'n His lazy Wain half round the northern Heav'n.— Dryd. alt. Ovid. Met. X. 'Twas now the Mid of Night, when Slumbers close Our Eyes, and sooth our Cares with soft Repose.— Dryd. Ibid. 'Twas dead of Night, when weary Bodies close Their Eyes in balmy Sleep, and sweet Repose: The Winds no longer whisper thro' the Woods, Nor murm'ring Tides disturb the gentle Floods: The Stars in silent Order mov'd around, And Peace, with downy Wings, was brooding o'er the Ground. The Flocks, and Herds, and parti-colour'd Fowl, Which haunt the Woods, or swim the weedy Pool, Stretch'd on the quiet Earth securely lay, Forgetting the past Labours of the Day.— Dryden. Æn. IV. Night! friendly Pow'r, beneath whose gloomy Reign, Yon spangled Arch glows with the starry Train: Who dost the Cares of Earth and Heav'n allay, Till Nature, quicken'd by th'inspiring Ray, Wakes to new Vigour with the rising Day.— Pope. Stat. Theb. L. I. Nobility. What's the Advantage, or the real Good, In tracing from the Source our antient Blood? To have our Ancestors in Paint or Stone, Preserv'd as Relicks, or, like Monsters, shewn? The brave Emilii, as in Triumph plac'd: The virtuous Curii, half by time defac'd: Corvinus, with a mould'ring Nose, that bears, Injurious Scars, the sad Effect of Years: And Galba grinning, without Nose or Ears? Vain are their Hopes, who fancy to inherit By Trees of Pedigree, or Fame, or Merit: Tho' plodding Heralds thro' each Branch may trace Old Captains, and Dictators of their Race, While their ill Lives that Family belie, And grieve the Brass which stands dishonour'd by.— Stepny. Juv. Sat. VIII. Long Galleries of Ancestors, and all The Follies which ill grace a Country-Hall, Challenge no Wonder or Esteem from me: Virtue alone is true Nobility.— Id. Ibid.

But who will call those Noble, who deface, By meaner Acts, the Glories of their Race: Whose only Title to their Father's Fame Is couch'd in the dead Letters of his Name? A Dwarf as well may for a Giant pass: A Negro for a Swan: a crook'd-back'd Lass Be call'd Europa.— Id. Ibid. If You have Strength Achilles' Arms to bear, And Courage to sustain a ten Years War, Tho' foul Thersites' Offspring, You shall be More lov'd by all, and more esteem'd by me, Than if by Chance You from some Hero came, In Nothing like your Father but his Name.— Id. Ibid. But, Ponticus, I would not you should raise Your Credit by hereditary Praise: Let your own Acts immortalize your Name: 'Tis poor relying on another's Fame: For take the Pillars but away, and all The Superstructure must in Ruins fall.— Id.

Ovid. Met. Lib. XIII. No slothful Heir am I to an Estate, Possessing, by Descent, paternal Lands: Nor nobly born, nor with proud Titles grac'd, Were any of my humble Ancestors; But Virtue, fair, and shining, is my boast.— The Man that vaunts his Race, but trumpets forth The Praise of Others.— Sen. Her. furens. For You believe, and You are right in this, No matter what his Race, but what he is: Before King Tullius time, by Birth a Slave, Innumerable low-born Men were brave; For Virtue and strict Probity renown'd, Rever'd they liv'd, with ample Honours crown'd.— Creech alt. Hor. Lib. I. Sat. 6. From a mean Stock the pious Decii came, Small their Estates, and vulgar was their Name: Yet such their Virtue, that their Loss alone, For Rome and all our Legions could attone: Their Country's Doom they by their own retriev'd, Themselves more Worth than all the Host they fav'd— Stepny. Juv. Sat. VIII. —Impartial Earth Wraps in her Lap with equal Care The High and Low: nor royal Birth Preserves it's poor Distinction there.— Hor. Lib. II.

I know My Father, Grandsire, and great Grandsire too: If farther I derive my Pedigree, I can but guess beyond the fourth Degree. The rest of my forgotten Ancestors, Were Sons of Earth like him, or Sons of Whores.— Dryd. Pers. Sat VI. But Thou hast Land: a Country Seat secure By a just Title: costly Furniture: A fuming Pan thy Lares to appease: What can be wanting when a Man has these? If this be not enough to swell thy Soul, Then please thy Pride, and search the Herald's Roll: Where thou shalt find thy famous Pedigree, Drawn from the Root of some old Tuscan Tree: And Thou, a thousand off, a Fool of long Degree: Who clad in Purple, can'st thy Censor greet, And loudly call him Cousin, in the Street.— Dryden. Pers. Sat. III. To whom is this Advice and Censure due? Rubellius Plautus, 'tis apply'd to You; Who think your Person second to divine, Because descended from the Drusian Line: Tho' yet you no illustrious Act have done, To make the World distinguish Julia's Son, From the vile Offspring of a Trull, who sits By the Town Wall, and for her living knits. You are poor Rogues, You cry, the baser Scum, The inconsiderable Dregs of Rome: Who know not from what Corner of the Earth, The Wretch obscure, who got you, stole his Birth: Mine I derive from Cecrops.—May your Grace Live, and enjoy the Splendor of your Race! Yet of these base Plebeians we have known Some, who, by charming Eloquence, have grown Great Senators, and Honours to that Gown: Some, at the Bar, with Subtlety defend The Cause of an unlearned noble Friend: Or on the Bench the knotty Laws untye. Others their stronger Youth to Arms apply: Go to Euphrates, or those Forces join Which garrison the Conquests near the Rhine. While You, Rubellius, on your Birth rely: Tho' You resemble your Great Family, No more than those rough Statues on the Road, (Which we call Mercuries,) are like that God. Your Highness tho' excells in this alone, You are a living Statue, they of Stone. That we may therefore You, not Your's, admire, First, Sir, some Honour of your own acquire: Add to that Stock, which justly we bestow, On those blest Shades to whom You all Things owe.— Stepny. Juv. Sat. VIII. On ev'ry Vice more public Shame attends, As he is Great, and Noble, who offends.— Id. Ibid. Why vaunt you thus of Pedigree?

By those bright Beams, Clymenè to her Son Phaeton. she cry'd, thy Mother swears: By Him who Us, and all Things sees, and hears! That Phæbus whom thou seest, who blesses Earth And Heav'n with cheering Influence, gave Thee Birth: If not, may I this Light for ever lose, And view that God no more, whose Name I use!— Trap. Ovid. Met. Lib. II. Then good Æneas with his Sword unsheath'd, Thus prays.—Thou Sun! be witness to my Vows! And Thou Ausonian Land, for which I bore Such mighty Toils! Thou Heav'n's Almighty King! And Thou, Saturnian Juno! Goddess! hear, Now more propitious! And Thou, potent Mars! Whose Deity controuls, and turns all Wars: You, Fountains! and You, Rivers! I invoke: And whatsoe'er Divinity resides, Or in high Heav'n above, or Seas below. — Then thus reply'd Latinus, with his Eyes erect to Heav'n, And his Right Hand extended to the Stars. By the same Pow'rs! by Earth! by Heav'n! and Sea! I swear, Æneas: by Latona's Twins! And two-fac'd Janus! by th' infernal Gods! And griefly Pluto's Court! Hear Thou this Oath, Great Jove! whose Thunder ratifies our Leagues. Upon the Altars, and the middle Fires I lay my Hand, and thus attest the Gods.— Id. Æn. Lib. XII. For by the black infernal Styx I swear, (That dreadful Oath which binds the Thunderer,) 'Tis fix'd: th' irrevocable Doom of Jove; No Force can bend me, no Perswasion move.— Pope. Stat. Lib. I. Obedience. 'Tis your's, great Queen, replies the Pow'r, to lay The Task, and mine to listen and obey.— Pitt. Æn. I. Whom Cæsar's Trumpet once proclaims a Foe. By the long Labours of the Sword, I swear, By all thy Fame acquir'd in ten Year's War, By thy past Triumphs, and by those to come, (No Matter where the Vanquish'd be, nor whom,) Bid me to strike my dearest Brother dead, To bring my aged Father's hoary Head, Or stab the pregnant Partner of my Bed: Tho' Nature plead, and stop my trembling Hand, I swear to execute thy dread Command.— Rowe.

In Youth, Distinctions infinite abound; No Shape, or Feature, just alike are found: The Fair, the Black, the Feeble, and the Strong: But the same Foulness does to Age belong: The self-same Palsy, both in Limbs and Tongue. The Skull and Forehead one bald barren Plain: And Gums unarm'd, that mumble Meat in vain. Besides th' eternal Drivel, that supplies The dropping Beard, from Nostrils, Mouth and Eyes. His Wife and Children loath him, and, what's worse, Himself does his offensive Carrion curse.— Dryden. What Music, or enchanting Voice can cheer A stupid, old, impenetrable ear? No Matter in what Place, or what Degree Of the full Theatre he sits to see: Cornets, and Trumpets, cannot reach his Ear: Under an Actor's Nose, he's never near. His Boy must bawl to make him understand The Hour o'th' Day, or such a Lord's at Hand: The little Blood that creeps within his Veins, Is but just warm'd in a hot Fever's Pains. He wears no Limb about him that is sound, With Sores; and Sicknesses, beleaguer'd round. Ask me their Names, I sooner could relate How many Lovers on lewd Hippia wait: What Crowds of Patients the Pill-Doctor kills: Or how, last Fall, he rais'd the weekly Bills.— Dryd. alt. One Dotard of his feeble Back complains, His Shoulder one, and one his Bowels pains: Another is of both his Eyes bereft, And envies who has One for aiming left. A Fifth with trembling Lips expecting stands, As in his Childhood, cramm'd by Others Hands: One, who at Sight of Supper open'd wide His Jaws before, and whetted Grinders try'd, Now only gapes, and waits to be supply'd: Like a young Swallow when with weary'd Wings, Expected Food her fasting Mother brings. The Loss of Members is a grievous Curse: But all the faculties decay'd, is worse. His Servants Names he has forgotten quite: Knows not his Friend, who supp'd with him last Night: Nor ev'n the Children he begot and bred.— But we'll suppose his Senses are his own, He lives to be chief Mourner for his Son: Before his Face his Wife and Brother burns: He numbers all his Kindred in their Urns. These are the Fines he pays for living long, And dragging tedious Age in his own Wrong: Griefs always green, a Household still in Tears, Sad Pomps, a Threshold throng'd with daily Biers, And Liveries of Black for Length of Years.— Dryden. Juv. Sat. X. Next to the Raven's Age, the Nestor, who according to Homer's Account, liv'd three hundred Years. Pylian King Was longest liv'd of any mortal Thing: Three hundred Seasons guzling Must of Wine: But hold a while, and hear himself repine At Fate's unequal Laws, and at the Clew, Which merciless in Length, the midmost Sister drew. When his brave Antilochus. Son upon the fun'ral Pyre He saw extended, and his Beard on Fire: He turn'd, and weeping, ask'd his Friends, what Crime Had curs'd his Age to that unhappy Time?— Id. Ibid. Learn to live well, or fairly make your Will: You've play'd, and lov'd, and eat, and drank your Fill: Walk sober off: before a sprightlier Age Comes titt'ring on, and shoves You from the Stage.

Full in the Center stood a shady Grove, Where first the Tyrians, toss'd by Waves and Winds, Digging, an Omen found, which Juno shew'd, A sprightly Horse's Head:—'Twas hence foretold, The Nation should thro' Ages be renown'd For War, and Conquest.— Id. Virg. Æn. Lib. I. When pious Gifts Dido. she on the Altars laid Smoking with Incense, (horrid to relate!) She saw the Liquors sacred to the Gods Turn black: and as the holy Wine was pour'd, It chang'd to putrid Gore.— Besides, within her Court a marble Dome There stood, devoted to her former Lord: Which with uncommon Honour she rever'd, With snowy Fleeces, and fresh Garlands crown'd. Hence Groans are heard, and her dead Husband's Voice Seeming to call aloud, when gloomy Night Obscures the World; and, on her Palace-Top, The lonely Owl with oft repeated Scream Complains, and spins into a dismal Length Her baleful Shrieks. Nor less the Warnings, giv'n By ancient Augurs, fright her restless Mind With terrible Predictions. In her Dreams Cruel Æneas persecutes her Soul To Madness. Still abandon'd to herself, Cheerless, without a Guide, she seems to go A long, a tedious Journey, and to seek Her Tyrian Subjects on deserted Coasts.— Id. Æn. Lib. IV. Just in the Center of the most retir'd And secret Court an holy Lawrel stood, For many Years religiously preserv'd: Here Bees, thick flying thro' the liquid Air, With humming Noise (surprizing to relate!) Beset its Top, and with their mutual Feet Connected, on the leafy Branches hung A sudden Swarm. Immediately the Sage Prophetic cries, a foreign Prince we see, From the same Quarter, on the Coasts arrive, And Sovereign in the lofty Palace reign. Besides, as chast Lavinia, royal Maid, Stood by her Father, and with holy Brands Kindled the Altars: with her flowing Hair, (Wondrous!) she seem'd to catch the Flame, and all Her Head-Attire to crackle in the Blaze: Her regal Tresses, and her Crown enrich'd With Gems, involv'd in ruddy Vapour glar'd, And all the Palace round diffus'd the Fire. That Omen of a strange and dire Portent Was rumour'd; For 'twas said, that she herself, By Fate, in Glory should illustrious rise, But to the People menac'd dreadful War.— Id. Virg. Æn. Lib. VII. —Now swift descending thro' the Sky, The Bird of Jove wing'd his auspicious Flight: Strange Voices in the left Hand Woods were heard, And issuing Flames flash'd thro' the Sylvan Gloom: Phœbus himself assum'd his brightest Beams, And with unusual Splendors deck'd the Sky.— Addison jun.

But above all, be careful to with-hold Your Talons from the Wretched and the Bold: Tempt not the Brave and Needy to despair: For tho' your Violence shou'd leave 'em bare Of Gold and Silver, Swords and Darts remain, And will revenge the Wrongs which they sustain. The plunder'd still have Arms.— Stepny. Juv. Sat. VIII. Oracles. See Sibyl. Oracle of Faunus. Uneasy at these Prodigies, the King Repairs to Faunus' Oracle. From hence All the Italian and Œnotrian Realms In Doubts seek Answers: Hither when the Priest Has brought his Off'rings, and in silent Night Sleeps on spread Skins of fleecy Victims slain: Unnumber'd Fantoms flutt'ring round He sees In wondrous Forms, and various Voices hears: These he consults, the future Fates to know, From the superior Gods, and from the Pow'rs below,— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. VII. Delphic Oracle. The Priestess every sacred Rite prepares. A Fillet gathers up her formost Hairs, While the white Wreath and Bays her Temples bind, And knit the looser Locks which flow behind. Close to the holy breathing Vent she cleaves, And largely the unwonted God receives: Nor Age the potent Spirit had decay'd, But with full Force he fills the heaving Maid. The mortal Mind, driv'n out, forsook her Breast, And the sole Godhead ev'ry Part possess'd. Now swell her Veins, her turgid Sinews rise, And, bounding frantick, thro' the Cave she flies: Her bristling Locks the wreathy Fillet scorn, And her fierce Feet the tumbling Tripods spurn. Now wild she dances o'er the vacant Fane, And whirls her giddy Head, and bellows with the Pain. Nor yet the less, th' avenging wrathful God, Pours in his Fires, and shakes his sounding In these divine Furies the Priestess seem'd to be driv'n along with Whips. Rod: He lashes now, and goads her on amain, And now He checks her stubborn to the Rein, Curbs in her Tongue, just lab'ring to disclose And speak that Fate which in her Bosom glows. Ages on Ages throng, a painful Load, Myriads of Images, and Myriads croud: Men, Times, and Things, or present, or to come, Work lab'ring in her Breast, and urge for room. Whatever is, shall be, or e'er has been, Rolls in her Thought, and to her Sight is seen. The Ocean's utmost Bounds her Eyes explore, And number ev'ry Sand on ev'ry Shore: Nature, and all her Marks, at once they see, Know when she first began, and when her End shall be. At length her foamy Mouth begins to flow, Groans more distinct, and Murmurs plainer grow: A doleful Howl the roomy Cavern shook, And thus the Maid in fainting Accents spoke.— She said: the God her lab'ring Tongue supprest, And in eternal Darkness veil'd the rest. Now thro' the Gates, with all her Force display'd, Impetuous sallies the prophetick Maid; Nor yet the holy Rage was all suppress'd, Part of the God still heaving in her Breast: Urg'd by the Demon, still she rolls her Eyes, And wildly wanders o'er the spacious Skies. Now horrid Purple flushes in her Face, And now a livid Pale supplies the Place: A double Madness paints her Cheeks by turns, With Fear she freezes, and with Fury burns: Nor can her weary Breast it's Heavings cease, But bursting Sighs rise fast to give her Ease. Now, by Degrees, the Fire Etherial fail'd, And the dull human Sense again prevail'd: Mean while, the God, in an eternal Shade, Hides the past Visions from the mortal Maid. Thick Clouds of dark Oblivion rife between, And snatch away at one the wond'rous Scene. Stretch'd on the Ground the fainting Priestess lies, While to the Tripod, back, th' informing Spirit flies.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. V. What Pow'r Divine forsakes the Heav'n's fair Light, To dwell with Earth, and everlasting Night? What is this Spirit, potent, wise, and great, Who deigns to make a mortal Frame his Seat? Who the long Chain of secret Causes knows: Whose Oracles the Years to come disclose: Who thro' Eternity at once foresees, And tells that Fate which He himself decress? Part of that Soul, perhaps, which moves in All, Whose Energy informs the pendant Ball, Thro' this dark Passage seeks the Realms above, And strives to re-unite itself to Jove. Whate'er the Demon, when He stands confess'd Within his raging Priestess' panting Breast, Dreadful his Godhead from the Virgin breaks, And thund'ring from her foamy Mouth He speaks.— Id. The gracious God, still ready with Replies, To none his Aid, or Oracle denies: Yet wise, and righteous ever, scorns to hear The Fool's fond Wishes, or the Guilty's Pray'r: Tho', vainly, in repeated Vows they trust, None e'er find Grace before him, but the Just. The Phœnicians, driven by Earthquakes from their Habitations, were advised by the Delphic Oracle, to settle first at Sidon, and afterwards at Tyre. When Greece was invaded by Xerxes, the Athenians were advised by the same Oracle, to trust to their wooden Walls, (their Ships) and, so doing, destroyed the Persians at Sea, at the Engagement of Salamis. A Famine in Egypt, and the Plague at Thebes, were likewise remov'd by consulting this Oracle.Oft to a banish'd, wandring, houseless Race, The sacred Dictates have assign'd a Place: Oft from the Strong He saves the Weak, in War: This Truth, ye Salaminian Seas declare! And heals the barren Land, and pestilential Air.— Id. Ibid. Full of the God that harbour'd in his Breast, Thoughts worthy of a God great Cato thus express'd. Cato, in his March thro' Lybia, being sollicited by Labienus in the Name of the whole Army, to consult the Oracle of Jupiter Ammon, whose Temple they were then approaching, declares his Sentiments of such Enquiries in a Manner becoming a brave and unshaken Mind.Whither, O Labienus, wouldst Thou go? What mighty Secrets dost Thou want to know? Is it a Doubt if Death should be my Doom, Rather than live till Kings and Bondage come: Rather than see a Tyrant crown'd in Rome? Or wouldst Thou know if Life itself be aught? Or what the Diff'rence 'twixt the long and short? Wouldst Thou be told if all the World conjoyn'd, Can shake, or hurt, the brave and honest Mind? If stable Virtue can her Ground maintain, While Fortune feebly threats and frowns in vain? If Truth and Justice with Uprightness dwell, And Praise be due for but intending well? Whether our Loss, or whether our Success, Can make our Honesty, or more, or less. If These the Secrets are You wou'd unfold, These may without an Oracle be told. Unsought, for These, be Ammon's sacred Ground, A nearer Temple of the God is found: From God deriv'd, to God by Nature join'd, We act the Dictates of his mighty Mind: And tho' the Priests and Oracles be still, God never wants a Voice to speak his Will: All that for us to know He thought was fit Is by himself within our Bosoms writ. Canst Thou believe the vast eternal Mind, To barren Plains of scorching Sands confin'd? That He would chuse this waste, this desart Ground, To teach the thin Inhabitants around, And let his Truth in Wilds alone be found? Is there a Place that God would chuse to love, Beyond this Earth, and Sea, yon' Heav'n above, And virtuous Minds, the noblest Throne of Jove? Why seek we farther then?—Behold around, Whate'er Thou seest dost with the God abound: He's ev'ry where, and always to be found. Let those weak Minds who live in Doubt and Fear, To jugling Priests for Oracles repair: The Oracles no Certainty can give, But Death will surely all our Woes relieve: One common Fate must wait upon Us all, The Coward, and the Brave, are doom'd to fall. This solves all Doubts, this leaves no room to fear: Jove told Us this, and needs no more declare.— So spoke the Hero: and to keep his Word, Nor Ammon, nor his Oracle explor'd: But left the Crowd at Freedom to believe, And take such Answers as the Priest should give.— Rowe alt. Lucan. Lib. IX. Orion. Who that the Scorpion's Insect Form surveys, Would think how ready Death his Call obeys? Threat'ning, he rears his knotty Tail on high: The vast Orion thus he doom'd to die, And fix'd him, his proud Trophy, in the Sky.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. IX. Next the bright Twins, see great Orion rise: His Arms extended, stretch o'er half the Skies: His Stride as large: and, with a stately Pace, He marches on, and measures a vast Space. On each broad Shoulder a bright Star's display'd, And three obliquely, grace his shining Blade. In his vast Head, immerst in boundless Spheres, Three Stars less bright, but yet as great, he bears: Tho' farther off remov'd, their Splendor's lost. Thus grac'd, and arm'd, he leads the starry Host.— Creech. Man. Lib. I. Osiris. See Bacchus. Osiris first, to frame the Plow-share found, And first with Steel tore up the tender Ground: First in th' unpractic'd Earth the Seed he threw, And first, from Trees unknown, ripe Apples drew. First prop'd the bending Branches of the Vine, And taught the clasping Tendrils where to twine: To prune the shooting Trees with timely Care, And stop the wild Luxuriance of the Year. He to express the Wine first taught the Use, And made the Vat o'erflow with gen'rous Juice. Wine tun'd the Voice to chant the charmful Song, And taught the Feet to bound in measur'd times along. Bacchus to Country Swains oppress'd with Cares, Gives Courage, and dissolves invading Fears. Bacchus gives Respite to the Wretch's Pains, Altho' with Fetters gall'd, and rattling Chains. Nor Cares, nor Woes, Osiris, Thee annoy, But thine the Song, the Dance, and Love's endearing Joy: The flowry Chaplet, and the Ivy Crown, The Saffron Mantle flowing loosely down, The purple Vest, the Flute's melodious Sound, And mystic Rites in sacred Silence bound.— Dart. alt. Tibul. I. Eleg. 8. Palace. See Banquet. A spacious Structure in the City's Height, Sublime upon an hundred Pillars stood, With gloomy Groves religiously obscure, Laurentian Picus' Palace: Where the Kings The first Inauguration of their Sway, The Scepters, and the regal Fasces took: This Court their Temple: Here the sacred Feasts: And here the Fathers, by th' accustom'd Rite, Killing a Victim Ram, in order sate Along the Forms. Before the stately Doors Th' Effigies of their Ancestors stood rang'd In Rows of antique Cedar: Italus, Father Sabinus, Planter of the Vine, Holding in Imag'ry his crooked Scythe, And aged Saturn, and the double Front Of Janus: and the other antient Kings, Who for their Country suffer'd Wounds in War. Besides: thick Arms upon the sacred Posts, Curve Scymiters, and captive Chariots hung; And Crests of Helmets: massy Bars of Gates: And Darts, and Shields, and Beaks from Vessels torn.— Trap. Æn. Lib. VII. Here Ceres' Palace, by the Cyclops rear'd, A stately Pile! in glitt'ring Pomp appear'd. Ir'n were the Posts and Walls: the spacious Door, With Sheets of stubborn Steel was plated o'er. The drudging Brethren, ne'er with equal Toil, Labour'd so vast a Work, or rais'd so firm a Pile: Nor the huge Bellows with their hollow Frame, Swell'd with such gather'd Blasts to urge the Flame: Nor ever such a rolling Flood before, Of molten Metal the hot Furnace bore. The Hall with Ivory was cover'd round, And Beams of Brass the lofty Summit bound: Amber in tow'ring Columns rose on high, And with it's golden Splendor charm'd the Eye.— Hughes alter'd. Claud. de Rapt. Pros. The Palatine, proud Rome's imperial Seat, (An awful Pile!) stands venerably Great: Thither the Kingdoms and the Nations come, In supplicating Crouds to learn their Doom: To Delphi less th' enquiring Worlds repair, Nor does a greater God inhabit there. This sure the pompous Mansion was design'd To please the mighty Rulers of Mankind: Inferior Temples rise on either Hand, And on the Borders of the Palace stand, While o'er the rest her Head she proudly rears, And lodg'd amidst her Guardian Gods appears.— Addison. Claud. de sexto Cons. Hon. Panic Fear. See Fear. Meanwhile the busy Messenger of Ill, Officious Fame, supplies new Terror still: A thousand Slaughters, and ten thousand Fears She whispers in the trembling Vulgar's Ears: But when approaching Cæsar they would paint, The stronger Image makes Description faint. No Tongue can speak, with what amazing Dread, Wild Thought presents him at his Army's Head: Unlike the Man familiar to their Eyes, Horrid he seems, and of gigantic Size: Unnumber'd Eagles rise amidst his Train, And Millions seem to hide the crowded Plain. Thus Fear does half the Work of lying Fame, And Cowards thus their own Misfortunes frame: By their own feigning Fancies are betray'd, And groan beneath those Ills themselves have made. Nor these Alarms the Crowd alone infest, But ran alike thro' ev'ry beating Breast: With equal Dread the grave Patrician's shook, Their Seats abandon'd, and the Court forsook. Resolv'd on Flight, yet still unknowing where To fly from Danger, or for Aid repair, Hasty, and headlong, diff'rent Paths they tread, As blind Impulse and wild Distraction lead: The Crowd, a hurrying, heartless Train, succeed. Who that the lamentable Sight beheld, The wretched Fugitives that hid the Field, Would not have thought the Flames, with rapid haste Destroying wide, had laid their City waste: Or groaning Earth had shook beneath their Feet, While threatning Buildings nodded o'er the Street. Then Sons forsook their Sires unnerv'd and old, Nor weeping Wives their Husbands could with-hold: Each left his Houshold Lares unador'd, Nor with one parting Pray'r their Aid implor'd: None stopp'd, or sighing turn'd for one last View, Or bid the City of his Birth adieu. The headlong Crowd, regardless, urge their Way, Tho' e'en their Gods and Country ask their Stay, And pleading Nature begs 'em to delay.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. I. —The City then he enter'd: The City with Confusion wild was fraught, And trembling shook with ev'ry dreadful Thought. They think he comes to ravage, sack, and burn: Religion, Gods, and Temples to o'erturn. Their Fears suggest him willing to pursue, Whatever Ills unbounded Pow'r can do.— Id. Lucan. Lib. III. Parents. See Education. Example. Opidius did, as Story goes, divide His Farms between his Sons before he dy'd: And said, and as he said he gravely smil'd, My Aulus, I observ'd Thee from a Child: And when I saw thee careless of thy Toys, And freely give thy Nuts to other Boys: And You, Tiberius, count them o'er and o'er, And hoard them up, increasing still your Store: I fear'd, both mad, would diff'rent Vices chuse, And One be covetous, and One profuse. Wherefore I charge You both, by all that's dear, As You my Blessing hope, or Curses fear, That neither You consume your small Estate, Nor You increase, but live content on That: Since all your proper Wants it will supply, And Nature thinks enough as well as I. And lest You be Ambitious, hear my Oath: Observe, I leave this Curse upon You both: He that of You shall be Ædilis first, Or ev'n a Prætor, let him be accurs'd!— Creech alter'd. Hor. Lib. II. Sat. 3. Observe, how ancient Marsus did advise: My Sons! let these small Cotts and Hills suffice: Let Us the Harvest of our Labour eat: 'Tis Labour makes the coarsest Diet sweet. The wiser Antients these Instructions gave: But now a covetous old crafty Knave, At dead of Night, shall rouze his Son, and cry, Turn out, You Rogue! how like a Beast You lie: Go, buckle to the Law: is this an Hour To stretch your Limbs!—You'll ne'er be Chancellor. Or else, yourself to Lelius recommend, To such broad Shoulders Lelius is a Friend: Fight under him, there's Plunder to be had: A Captain is a very gainful Trade: And when in Service your best Days are spent, In time You may command a Regiment. But if the Trumpet's Clangor You abhor, And cannot undergoe the Toils of War, Take to a Shop, behind a Counter lie, Cheat half in half: none thrive by Honesty. Never reflect upon the sordid Ware Which You expose: be Gain your only Care. He that grows rich by scouring of a Sink, Gets wherewithal to justify the Stink. This Sentence, worthy Jove himself, record As true, and take it on a The Poet Ennius who wrote the Sentence that follows. Poet's Word: “That you get Money, is a needful Task, “But how you get it, none will ever ask.— Dryden jun. Juv. Sat. XIV. Would any one think now that he's my Father, or that I am his Son!—If he had been a Friend or a Brother, could he have shewn more Kindness or Complaisance? Ought I not to love him! ought I not to wear him next my Heart!—This wonderful Goodness of his engages me to be always upon my Guard, least I should imprudently do any thing to disoblige him.— Teren. Adelph. Parting. Then old Evander, with a close Embrace, Strain'd his departing Son, while Tears o'erflow'd his Face: Would Heav'n, said He, my Strength and Youth recal, Such as I was beneath Preneste's Wall: Such if I stood renew'd, not these Alarms, Nor Death, should rend me from my Pallas' Arms. Ye Gods! and mighty Jove! in pity bring Relief, and hear a Father and a King! If Fate and You reserve these Eyes to see My Son return with joyful Victory: If the lov'd Boy shall bless his Father's Sight: If we shall meet again with more delight: Then draw my Life in Length: let me sustain, In Hopes of his Embrace, the worst of Pain! But, if your hard Decrees, which,—Oh!—I dread, Have doom'd to Death his undeserving Head: This, O this very Moment, let me die! While Hopes and Fears in equal Ballance lie: While, yet possess'd of all his youthful Charms, I strain him close within these aged Arms: Before that fatal News my Soul shall wound!— The Servants bear him fainting to his Court.— Dryden. Virg. Æn. VIII. — My Philomel, If any Sense of Duty sways your Mind, Let me from You the shortest Absence find. He wept: then kiss'd his Child: and while he speaks, The Tears fall gently down his aged Cheeks: While, in a Voice, with dire Forebodings broke, Sobbing, and faint, the last Farewel was spoke.— Croxall. Ovid. Met. Lib. VI. But when Alcyone. she saw her Lord prepar'd to part, A deadly Cold ran shiv'ring to her Heart: Her faded Cheeks are chang'd to boxen Hue, And in her Eyes the Tears are ever new: She thrice essay'd to speak, but thrice in vain, For Sobs and Sighs her falt'ring Voice restrain.— Dryd. alt. Ovid. Met. Lib. XI. He soon equips the Ship, supplies the Sails, And gives the Word to launch.—She trembling views This Pomp of Death, and parting Tears renews: Then clasp'd him round, and took a long Farewel, Sigh'd with a sad Presage, and swooning fell. While Ceyx seeks Delays, the lusty Crew, Rais'd on their Banks, their Oars in order drew To their broad Breasts:—away the Vessel flew. The Queen, recover'd, rears her humid Eyes, And first her Husband on the Poop espies, Shaking his Hand, at Distance, on the Main: She took the Sign, and shook her Hand again. Still as the Ground receeds, contracts her View With sharpen'd Sight, till she no longer knew The much lov'd Face: that Comfort lost supplies With less, and now the Galley feeds her Eyes: The Galley, born from view, by rising Gales, She follows with her Sight the flying Sails: When ev'n the flying Sails are seen no more, Forsaken of all Sight she leaves the Shore: And on her lonely Bed her Body throws, Hoping to gain some Respite from her Woes: Her Husband's Pillow there, and widow'd Part Which once he press'd, again torment her Heart.— Dryd. While thus united Cæsar's Arms appear, And Pompey finds the great Decision near, Uneasy Thoughts his manly Soul infest, And dear Pompey's Wife. Cornelia pains his anxious Breast. To distant Lesbos fain he would remove, Far from the War, the Partner of his Love. Oft he prepares to speak, but knows not how; Knows they must part, but cannot bid her go: Defers the killing News with fond Delay, And ling'ring, puts off Fate from Day to Day. The fleeting Shades began to leave the Sky, And Slumber soft forsook the drooping Eye, When, with fond Arms, the fair Cornelia press'd Her Lord, reluctant, to her snowy Breast: Wond'ring she found he shunn'd her just Embrace, And felt warm Tears upon his manly Face. Heart-wounded with the sudden Woe, she griev'd, And scarce the weeping Warrior yet believ'd.— When with a Groan, thus He. My faithful Wife, To say how much I love Thee more than Life, Poorly expresses what my Heart would show, Since Life, alas! is grown my Burden now. That long, too long delay'd, that dreadful Doom, That cruel parting Hour at length is come. Fierce, haughty, and collected in his Might, Advancing Cæsar calls me to the Fight. Haste then, my gentle Love, from War retreat, The Lesbian Isle attends, thy peaceful Seat. Nor seek, Oh! seek not to increase my Cares, Seek not to change my Purpose with thy Pray'rs: My self, in vain, the fruitless Suit have try'd, And my own pleading Heart has been deny'd. Stunn'd, and astonish'd, at the deadly Stroke, All Sense, at first, the Matron sad forsook. Motion, and Life, and Speech at length returns, And thus, in Words of heaviest Woe she mourns. No, Pompey! 'tis not that my Lord is dead, 'Tis not the Hand of Fate has robb'd my Bed: But like some base Plebeian I am curst, And by my cruel Husband stand divorc'd. Is thy Cornelia's Faith so poorly known, That Thou shouldst think her safer whilst alone? Are not our Loves, our Lives, our Fortunes one? This said, the Matron start'd from her Bed, And, wild with Sorrow, from her Husband fled: She sees all ling'ring, all Delays are vain, And rushes, headlong, to possess the Pain: Nor will the Hurry of her Griefs afford One last Embrace from her forsaken Lord. How piteous was the parting of these two! After a Love so lasting and so true, Neither could bear to speak the Word—Adieu. In all the woeful Days that cross'd their Bliss, Sure never Hour was known so sad as this! Low on the Ground the fainting Dame is laid: Her Train officious hasten to her Aid: Then gently rearing, with a careful Hand, Support her, slow-descending o'er the Strand. There, while with eager Arms she grasp'd the Shore, Scarcely the Mourner to the Bark they bore.— Rowe alt. Lucan. Lib. V. Passions. See Doubt. As Grief grows mutual, Joy produces Joy, For Face to Face conveys strong Sympathy. Wouldst Thou have me with Tears thy Sorrow share? Weep first thyself, and let thy Woes appear: 'Tis then to soft Compassion I incline, Then Fancy works, and thy Misfortune's mine. The Cholerick must rage, the Sad complain, The Grave be serious, and the Frolick vain: For Nature ever doth the Change begin, The Mind inclines, and models Us within: According to the various Turns of Fate, She screws the Soul to an unusual Height, And swells Us into Rage; or bending low, She sinks us to the Dust with weighty Woe: Then, as the Passions diff'rently prevail, She makes the Tongue declare what inwardly we feel.— Ames alter'd. Hor. Art. Poet. Unless the Mind be purg'd, what Storms arise! What Dangers still appear before our Eyes! The Man that's covetous how many Cares Gall and torment, how many anxious Fears! What Mischiefs, what dire Murders shall we find, Where Pride, and Lust,— Where Luxury, and Sloth, possess the Mind!— The Man a nobler Empire gains, That his own craving Will restrains, Than he whose Sword and wide Command Join distant Spain and Lybia's Land: Than he whose far extended Sway, Carthage both old and new obey.— Creech alter'd. Hor. Lib. II. Ode 2. Alas! by diff'rent Passions I'm oppress'd! Fierce Love and Hate contend within my Breast: My Bosom they divide, but Love I fear Will prove too strong, and gain a Conquest there. I'll strive to hate Thee; but if that should prove A fruitless Strife, spite of myself I'll love. The Bull dislikes the galling Yoke, but still He bears the Thing he hates, against his Will. I hate, I fly Thee, faithless Fair! in vain, Thy Beauty ever brings me back again, Thou in my Heart wilt always find a Place: I hate thy Humour, but I love thy Face. No Rest I to my tortur'd Soul can give, Nor with Thee, nor without Thee, can I live. Oh! that thy Mind We in thy Face could view! Less lovely that Thou wer't, or else more true! How diff'rent are thy Manners, and thy Sight? Thy Deeds forbid Us, but thy Eyes invite. Thy Actions shock Us, while thy Beauty moves: And He who hates thy Faults, thy Person loves. Ah! happy, ever happy should I be, If I no Charms, or no Defects could see.— Anon. alter'd. Ovid. Amor. Lib. III. El. 10. Patience.

No Stings of private Hate his Peace molest, Nor partial Favour grew upon his Breast: But safe from Prejudice Cato. he kept his Mind, Free, and at Leisure to lament Mankind. There were the stricter Manners of the Man, And this the stubborn Course in which they ran: The golden Mean, unchanging, to pursue: Constant to keep the purpos'd End in view: Religiously to follow Nature's Laws, And die, with Pleasure, in his Country's Cause: To think he was not for himself design'd, But born to be of Use to all Mankind. To him 'twas Feasting, Hunger to repress: And home-spun Garments were his costly Dress. No marble Pillars rear'd his Roof on high, 'Twas warm, and kept him from the Winter Sky: He sought no End of Marriage, but Increase: Nor wish'd a Pleasure, but his Country's Peace: That took up all the tend'rest Parts of Life, His Country was his Children and his Wife. From Justice' righteous Rules he never swerv'd, But rigidly his Honesty preserv'd: On universal Good his Thoughts were bent, Nor knew what Gain, or Self-affection meant: And while his Benefits the Publick share, Cato was always last in Cato's Care.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. II. His helpless Country like an Orphan left, Friendless and poor, of all Support bereft, He took and cherish'd with a Father's Care, He comforted, he bad her not to fear, And taught her feeble Hands once more the Trade of War. Nor Lust of Empire did his Courage sway, Nor Hate, nor proud Repugnance to obey: Passions and private Int'rest he forgot: Nor for himself, but Liberty he fought.— Id. Lucan. Lib. IX. Peace. —Ages mild Shall next succeed, and War no more be heard: Then Faith, and Vesta, and Quirinus, joyn'd With Remus, shall give Laws: strong massy Bars, And Bolts of solid Iron, fast shall close War's dreadful Portals: impious The Picture of War was painted in this manner by Apelles; and Virgil is supposed to have taken this Description from thence. Rage within Sitting on horrid Armour, and behind Bound with an hundred brazen Knots, shall roar With bloody Mouth, and foaming bite his Chains.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. I. She first, white Peace, the Earth with Plough-shares broke, And bent the Oxen to the crooked Yoke: First rear'd the Vine, and hoarded first with Care The Father's Vintage for his drunken Heir.— Addison.

Peace is the greatest Good Mankind can know: Peace, Peace alone, outweighs a thousand Triumphs: Peace, the dear Blessing of Security, To all impartial, gives.— Silius Ital. Lib. II. By the fair Name of Peace we are betray'd.— None deep in Mines would dig the brazen Ore, Mark out the Trench, or raise the lofty Tow'r; Ne'er would the Steed in Armour seek the Plain, Or Fleets encounter on th' unstable Main, If Liberty could well be chang'd for Peace.— Lucan. L. IV. Oh see at length! with Pity, Cæsar, see These with'ring Arms, these Hairs grown white for Thee. In painful Wars our joyless Days have pass'd, Let weary Age lie down in Peace at last: Give Us, on Beds, our dying Limbs to lay, And sigh, at home, our parting Souls away: Let our poor Babes, and weeping Wives be by, To close our drooping Eye-lids when we die. Be merciful, and let Disease afford Some other Way to die, beside the Sword: Let us no more a common Carnage burn, But each be laid in his own decent Urn.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. V. The Maid Armipotent, that dreadful Pow'r, Who drives th' embattl'd Host, and shakes the solid Tow'r, Laid by her Spear, and all her War-attire, Now mildly mixes with the softer Quire: The Horror of her Helm, the Warrior's Pride, Wreaths of fair Roses innocently hide: She shines with peaceful Decorations dress'd, And Flow'rs nod harmless from her lofty Crest.— Hughes.

Whate'er Fruits the Trees, and Fields, Spontaneous, and without Compulsion give, He gathers: nor e'er sees the Iron Laws, The publick Registers, or noisy Bar.— Ibid. The Farmer with the crooked Plow upturns The Glebe: from hence his annual Labour: hence His Children, and his Country He sustains, His lowing Herds, and well-deserving Steers. No Pause, but still with Fruit the Year abounds: With Apples, or th' Increase of Ewes and Kine, Or with full Sheaves of Corn, the Gift of Ceres: He loads the Furrows, and o'erpow'rs the Barns. Winter comes on: the Presses bruise the Fruit Of Sicyonian Olives: Fat with Mast The Swine return: the Woods their Berries yield: Autumn it's various Product too resigns: And Summer on high Rocks the Vintage swells. Mean-while their tender Parents Kisses round Hang the sweet Babes: the Family all chaste, Virtue and spotless Modesty preserves. The Kine their Dugs with Milk distended bring: And the fat sportive Kids in Pastures green Frisk on the Turf, and push with butting Horns.— Id. Ibid. The Country Peasant meditates no Harm, When clad with Skins of Beasts to keep him warm, In Winter Weather, unconcern'd he goes Almost Knee-deep thro' Mire, in clumsy Shoes: Vice dwells in Palaces, is richly drest, There glows in Scarlet, and the Tyrian Vest.— Dryd. jun. Juv. Sat. XIV. Stretch'd on the Turf in Sylvan Shades, No Fear the Peasant's Rest invades: While gilded Roofs, and Beds of State, Perplex the Slumbers of the Great. Secure, he rears the beachen Bowl, With steady Hand, and fearless Soul. Pleas'd with his plain and homely Meats, No Swords surround him as He eats. His modest Wife, of Virtue try'd, Knows not th' expensive Arts of Pride: Her Neck no circling Jewels wears, No Pearls depending load her Ears: No Silks she boasts from India brought, Rich by the painting Needle wrought: Nor proud, allures each wanton Eye, In Stuffs of double Tyrian Dye. Her easy Wish, the home-spun Fleece, Plain in it's native Hue, can please: And, happy in her nuptial Bed, No jealous Doubts disturb her Head: Unlike the Dame, whose Day of Birth, Is solemniz'd thro' half the Earth.— Ward alter'd. Senec. Herc. Œt. People First. See Golden Age. Men did, as yet, no use of Fire know, To dress their Food; nor round their Bodies throw The Skins of Beasts for Cloths: but, then confin'd, In Woods and Caves they liv'd,— To save them from the stormy Rains and Wind. No fixt Society, no steddy Laws, No publick Good was known, no common Cause: But every one laid hold on what he cou'd, By Nature taught to seek his private Good.— Then, strong and swift, they did the Beasts pursue, And many, arm'd with Stones and Clubs, they slew: But to their Caves from some they cautiously withdrew. When Night came on, wrapt round with Boughs they lay, Upon the Ground like Hogs, and rough as they.— Creech alter'd. After, when Cots were built, and Fire began, And Skins of Beasts afforded Cloths for Man: When one to one confin'd, in chaste Embrace Enjoy'd sweet, Love, and saw a num'rous Race, Then Men grew soft: the Temper of his Mind Was chang'd from rough to mild, from fierce to kind. Then Neighbours, by Degrees familiar grown, Made Leagues and Bonds, and each secur'd his own. This made them Laws enact, and led their Choice To Rulers: Power was giv'n by public Voice: For Men, worn out, and tir'd by constant Strife, Began at last to wish a quiet Life: And so submitted, of their own accord, To rigid Laws, and their elected Lord.— Creech. Lucret. V. Kings then began to build them Towns and Forts, Wherein to live secure, and keep their Courts: 'Mongst all they shar'd the Cattle and the Ground, And round each Portion mark'd the steady Bound. Each his Allotment had, as seem'd most fit, According to his Beauty, Strength, or Wit: For Beauty, then, and Strength were most esteem'd. Creech alter'd. Ibid. Before that Time Life was an artless State, Of Reason void, and thoughtless in Debate: Nature lay hid in deepest Night below: None knew her Wonders, and none car'd to know. Men Upwards look'd, they saw the circling Light, Pleas'd with the Fires, and wonder'd at the Sight: The Sun, when Night came on, withdrawn, they griev'd, As dead: and joy'd next Morn, when he reviv'd. But why the Nights grew long, or short, the Day Was chang'd, and Shadows varied with the Ray, Shorter at his Approach, and longer grown At his Remove, the Causes were unknown. Arts were not then found out, the desart Plains Were unmanur'd, nor fed the idle Swains: Ev'n Gold in Hills lay hid, then none resign'd Their Lives to Seas, or Wishes to the Wind: Confin'd their Search, they knew themselves alone, And thought that only worthy to be known.— Creech. Manil. Lib. I. Perjury. How ready now is every Wretch to swear: How fearless to affront the conscious Gods, If so from Man he may his Guilt conceal! Observe, how clear his Voice, when he denies: How steady! how like Innocence his Look! By the bright Sun! he swears, by Jove's red Bolts! By Mars his Lance! and by Apollo's Shafts! By the sharp Arrows of the Huntress-Maid, And by her Quiver! by thy mighty Trident, Neptune, great Father of the vast Ægeon! To these, he adds, the Bow of Hercules, Minerva's Spear, and whate'er dreadful Arms Beside the Magazines of Heav'n contain. If he a Father is, may I, he cries, My Son, You Gods! my dearest Son devour, Dipping each mangled Morsel in the Sauce, If I'm not innocent.— Juv. Sat. XIII. Dare him to swear, he with a chearful Face, Flies to the Shrine, and bids Thee mend thy Pace: He urges, goes before Thee, shews the Way, Nay, pulls Thee on, and chides thy dull Delay: For Confidence in Sin, when mixt with Zeal, Seems Innocence, and looks to most as well.— Creech. Ibid. When once our lustful Wishes sated are, For Promises, or Vows, we little care.— Catull. Philosophy. Happy the Man, who, studying Nature's Laws, Thro' known Effects can trace the secret Cause: Who, without Fear, his certain Fate can meet, And trample Death itself beneath his Feet.— Dryden. Virg. Georg. Lib. II. 'Tis pleasant, when the Seas are rough to stand, And view another's Danger, safe at Land: Not 'cause he's troubl'd, but 'tis sweet to see Those Cares and Fears from which Ourselves are free. 'Tis also pleasant, to behold, from far, Armies engage: secure Ourselves from War.— Creech. But much more sweet, thy lab'ring Steps to guide To Virtue's Heights, with Wisdom well supply'd, And all the Magazines of Learning fortify'd: From thence to look below on Humankind, Bewilder'd in the Maze of Life, and blind: To see vain Fools ambitiously contend, For Wit and Pow'r; their last Endeavours bend T' outshine each other, waste their Time and Health In search of Honour, and pursuit of Wealth.— Dryden. Lucret. Lib. II. —As Children are surpriz'd with Dread, And tremble in the dark: so riper Years, Ev'n in broad Day-light, are possess'd with Fears, And shake at Shadows: fanciful and vain As those which in the Breast of Children reign. These Bugbears of the Mind, this inward Hell, No Rays of outward Sunshine can dispell: But Nature and right Reason must display Their Beams abroad, and bring the darksome Soul to Day.— Ibid. Ibid. Oh! if the foolish Race of Man, who find A Weight of Cares, still pressing on their Mind: Could find as well the Cause of their Unrest, And all this Burden lodg'd within the Breast, Sure they would change their Course: not live as now, Uncertain what to wish, or what to vow: Uneasy both in Country, and in Town, They search a Place to lay their Burden down: One restless in his Palace walks abroad, And vainly thinks to leave behind the Load: But straight returns: for he's as restless there, And finds there's no Relief in open Air. Another to his Villa would retire, And spurs as hard as if it were on Fire: No sooner enter'd at his Country-Door, But he begins to yawn, and stretch, and snore; Or seeks the City, which he left before. Thus ev'ry Man o'er-works his weary Will, To shun himself, and to shake off his Ill; The shaking Fit returns, and hangs upon him still: No Prospect of Repose, nor Hope of Ease: The Wretch is ignorant of his Disease; Which known would all his guiltless Trouble spare, For he would know the World not worth his Care: Then would he search more deeply for the Cause, And study Nature well, and Nature's Laws.— Id. Lucret. Lib. III. Doth creeping Avarice thy Mind engage? Or doth it boil with fiery Lust and Rage? Why there are Rules and Precepts that can ease Thy Pain, and cure great part of thy Disease. Or art Thou vain?—Books yield a certain Spell, To stop thy Tumour: thou shalt cease to swell, When thou hast read them thrice, and studied well. The Man that's envious, or to Anger prone, Slothful, or drunk, in Love, or all in one: There's none so void of Reason, none so wild, As not to be reclaim'd, and render'd mild, If he consults true Wisdom's Rules with Care, And to Instruction lends a patient Ear.— Creech alter'd. Hor. Lib. I. Epist 1. Thrice happy They, who first, with Souls refin'd, To these Pursuits their gen'rous Care confin'd: Who, nobly spurning Earth's impure Abodes, Essay'd to climb the Mansions of the Gods. Such Minds sublime, Intemp'rance never broke; Such ne'er submitted to Love's shameful Yoke; Such fled the Wrangling of the noisy Bar, The hideous Din of Arms, and painful Toils of War. Foes to Ambition and her idle Lure, From thirst of Fame, from thirst of Gold, secure: Such Souls, examining the distant Skies, Unveil'd it's hidden Lights to mortal Eyes. Let huge Olympus lofty Ossa bear: Let Pelion tow'r on Ossa high in Air: Mountains on Mountains short of Heav'n must rise; This only Ladder reaches to the Skies.— Anon. Ovid. Fast. Lib. I. Physician and Patient. Thus a sick Man to his Physician said: Methinks I am not right in ev'ry Part: I feel a kind of trembling at my Heart: My Pulse unequal, and my Breath is strong, Besides a filthy Fur upon my Tongue. The Doctor heard him, exercis'd his Skill: And, after, bid him for four Days be still. Three Days he took good Counsel, and began To mend, and look like a recov'ring Man: The fourth, he could not hold from drink, but sends His Boy to one of his old trusty Friends: Adjuring him, by all the Pow'rs divine, To pity his Distress, who could not dine Without a Flaggon of his healing Wine. He drinks a swilling Draught, and lin'd within, Will supple in the Bath his outward Skin. Whom should he find but his Physician there, Who, wisely, bad him once again, beware. Sir, you look wan: you hardly draw your Breath: Drinking is dang'rous, and the Bath is Death. 'Tis Nothing, says the Fool:—But, says the Friend, This Nothing, Sir, will bring You to your End. Do I not see your Dropsy-Belly swell? Your yellow Skin?—No more of that, I'm well. One of your Tribe I've bury'd, Sir, and He Talk'd just as You do now:— And, Doctor, I may live to bury Thee. Thou tell'st me, I look ill: and Thou look'st worse. I 'ave done, says the Physician;—take your Course. The laughing Sot, like all unthinking Men, Bathes and gets drunk: then bathes and drinks again. His Throat half throtled with corrupted Phlegm, And breathing thro' his Jaws a belching Steam, Amidst his Cups with shiv'ring Faintness seiz'd, His Limbs disjoynted, and all o'er diseas'd, His Hand refuses to sustain the Bowl, And his Teeth chatter, and his Eyeballs roll, Till, with his Meat, he vomits out his Soul.— Dryd. alt. Pers. Sat. III. Diseases in a thousand Forms are rang'd: As Tempers alter, Med'cines must be chang'd. The cutting Steel some Bodies must endure, A simple Drug on many works a Cure.— Ovid. Rem. Amor. Piety. Chief of the Skies, Celestial Piety! Whose Godhead, priz'd by those of heav'nly Birth, Revisits rare these tainted Realms of Earth: Mild, in thy milk-white Vest, to sooth my Friend, With holy Fillets on thy Brows descend: Such as of old (e'er chac'd by Guilt and Rage) A Race unpolish'd, and a golden Age, Beheld Thee frequent. Once more come below: Mix in the sad Solemnities of Woe: See, see, thy own Hetruscus wastes the Day In pious Grief, and wipe his Tears away.— Addison. Stat. Sylv. III. Pigmalion and the Statue. Long time Pigmalion led a single Life: Women were so bad he durst not take a Wife: But hating Idleness, the Source of Ill, In curious Sculpture exercis'd his Skill: And carv'd a Maid of Ivory, fo fair, That Nature could not with his Art compare. With Admiration struck Pigmalion stands, And doats on Beauties made by his own Hands. The Statue wore a real Virgin's Face, And seeming Life did ev'ry Feature grace: It cou'd have mov'd, (one would have thought,) but strove With Modesty, and was asham'd to move. Art hid with Art, so well perform'd the Cheat, It caught the Carver with his own Deceit. Pleas'd with Surprize his Eyes her Charms explore, And still, the more he looks, he loves the more. With curious Hand he feels it oft, to try If Flesh it be, or only Ivory: Nor that 'tis Iv'ry can himself perswade, But courts and clasps it like a living Maid: Kisses, and thinks that she returns the Kiss, Grasps, and believes her Fingers twin'd in his. But when he strain'd her hard, he was afraid His Hands had made a Dint, and bruis'd his Maid. With Flatt'ry now her Mind he seeks to move, And now with Gifts, the pow'rful Bribes of Love: Her Closet first he furnishes, and fills The crowded Shelves with Rarities of Shells: And orient Pearls, which from the Conchs he drew, And all the sparkling Stones of various Hue: And Parrots imitating human Tongue, And singing Birds in silver Cages hung: And ev'ry beauteous Flow'r, and fragrant Green, And painted Toys, and Amber, shone between. Rich fashionable Robes her Person deck, Pendants her Ears, and Pearls adorn her Neck: Her taper Fingers glitt'ring Diamonds grac'd, And an embroider'd Zone surrounds her slender Waste: But tho' with all this Cost and Trouble drest, Lovely she look'd; she look'd when naked best. Along he lays her on a stately Bed, With Cov'rings of Sidonian Purple spread: Calls her his Bride, and, as of Sense possess'd, Soft Pillows places for her Head to rest. The Feast of Venus came: a solemn Day, To which the Cypriots due Devotion pay: With gilded Horns the Milk-white Heifers led, Slaughter'd before the sacred Altars bled: And Clouds of Incense o'er the Altar spread. Pigmalion too with Gifts approach'd the Shrine, And trembling thus implor'd the Pow'rs divine: Almighty Gods! if all we Mortals want, If all we can require, be yours to grant, Make this fair Statue mine, he would have said, But chang'd his Words for shame: and only pray'd, Give me a Wife just like my Iv'ry Maid! The Golden Goddess present at the Pray'r, Well knew he meant th' inanimated Fair; And gave the Sign of granting his Desire, For thrice in chearful Flames ascends the Fire. To his dear Image home again he hies, And on the Bed close to her Bosom lies: His Lips to her's he press'd; the Virgin's Kiss To him seem'd warm, and oft he prov'd the Bliss. Transported more, no longer now he stays, But his fond Hand on her hard Bosom lays: Hard tho' it was, beginning to relent, The Iv'ry Breast beneath his Fingers bent: The pleasing Task he fails not to renew, Soft, and more soft, at ev'ry Touch it grew: Like pliant Wax, when working Hands reduce The Mass to Form, and make it fit for Use. Amaz'd, he would believe, but still in Pain, He fondly wanders o'er her once again: And feels the soft'ning Flesh inform'd with Heat, And in each Vein the leaping Pulses beat. Convinc'd, o'erjoy'd, his study'd Thanks and Praise, To her who made the Miracle he pays: His Lips to her's he joins, which seem to melt, For now the Virgin his warm Kisses felt: And as she, blushing, ope's her beauteous Eyes, At once her Lover, and the Light she spies. The Goddess bless'd the Marriage she had made: And when nine Crescents had at full display'd, Their joining Horns, repleat with borrow'd Flame, She Paphos bore: who gave that Isle a Name.— Dryd. alt. Ovid. Met. Lib. X. Pilot. See Navigation. Scarce half the Hours of silent Night were fled, When careful Palinure forsakes his Bed: And ev'ry Breath explores that stirs the Seas, And watchful listens to the passing Breeze: Observes the Course of ev'ry Orb on high, That moves in silent Pomp along the Sky: Arcturus, dreadful with his stormy Star, The watry Hyads, and the northern Car: In the blew Vault his piercing Eyes behold, The huge Orion flame in Arms of Gold. When all serene he saw th' Etherial Plain, He gave the Signal to the slumb'ring Train: Our Tents we strike: the Canvas We display, And wing with spreading Sails the watry Way.— Pitt. Æn. Lib. III. Now, on the full extended Main, the Land No more appear'd: but all was Sea, and Sky: A dusky Cloud hung gather'd o'er his Head, Bringing on Night, and Storm: upon the Waves Lay horrid Darkness: from the lofty Deck The Pilot's self, ev'n Palinurus, cries, What Clouds, alas! invelop all the Heav'ns? Or what, great Neptune! does thy Will intend? This said, he gives command to furl their Sails, And strongly ply their Oars: Then turns oblique His Canvas to the Wind, and Thus proceeds: Magnanimous Æneas, should ev'n Jove By promising assure my Voyage safe, I could not in this Weather hope to reach The Coasts of Italy. The Winds transverse Roar chang'd, and from the low'ring West arise: And all the Air is thicken'd to a Cloud Nor have We Strength to bear against the Stress Of Sea, and Sky: Since Fortune all o'er-powers, Her let Us follow, and where-e'er she calls, Direct our Course.— Trap. Æn. Lib. V. No Hand the Helm more skilfully could guide, Or stem the Fury of the boist'rous Tide: He knew what Winds would on the Morrow blow, And how the Sails for Safety to bestow: Celestial Signals well he could descry, Could read the radiant Lights that shine on high, And tell the coming Tempest of the Sky. When from some hostile Hand a fatal Dart, Deep piercing, trembled in his panting Heart: Yet still his careful Hand it's Task supplies, And turns the guiding Rudder as he dies.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. III. Place (Barren.) Their Fountains dry'd, the weeping Naiads mourn'd, The Trees stood bare, with fearing Cankers burn'd: No Herbage cloath'd the Ground: a ragged Flock Of Goats half-famish'd lick'd the naked Rock.— Catcott. Ovid. Met. Lib. XIII. Barren, and desolate, those Regions lie, That border on the Syrts, and feel too nigh The sultry Summer Sun, and parching Sky. No Harvest there the scatter'd Grain repays, But withering dies, and e'er it shoots decays. There never flourishes the mantling Vine, Nor round the Elm her wanton Tendrils twine: The thirsty Dust prevents the swelling Fruit, Drinks up the gen'rous Juice, and kills the Root. Thro' secret Veins no temp'ring Moistures pass, To bind with viscous Force the mould'ring Mass: But genial Jove averse, disdains to smile, Forgets, and curses the neglected Soil. Thence lazy Nature droops her idle Head, As ev'ry vegetable Sense were dead: Thence the wide dreary Plains one Visage wear: Alike in Summer, Winter, Spring appear, Nor feel the Turns of the revolving Year.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. IX. No Autumn here e'er cloths herself with Green, Nor joyful Spring the languid Herbage cheers: Nor feather'd Warblers chant their pleasing Strains, In vernal Consort to the rushing Boughs: But Chaos reigns, and ragged Rocks around With nought but baleful Cypress are adorn'd. Petron. Arb. Place (Pleasant.) See Fountain. Italy. —Æneas from the Ocean spies A spacious Wood: Thro' which the pleasant Stream Of gulphy Tyber rolls his yellow Sand, And disembogues his Waves into the Sea. Here various Birds, accustom'd to the Banks And Chanel of the River, all around, And all above, with sweet melodious Songs Soften'd the Air, and flutter'd in the Grove.— Trap. Æn. Lib. VII. Smooth lay the verdant Plain, and all around With mild Ascent swell'd slow the rising Ground. By unperceiv'd Degrees the Mountain grew, Easy to tread, and graceful to the View. Here chrystal Fountains, from the living Stone, In winding Streams thro' flow'ry Meadows run: There ancient venerable Woods extend, Which from the fierce meridian Beams defend: These in the sultry Heat of Summer made A welcome Coolness, and refreshing Shade. Of various Kinds the Trees: the sailing Fir; The close-grain'd Cornel, tough, and fit for War: Jove's fav'rite Oak; the fun'ral Cypress' Height: The honey'd Ilex wherein Bees delight: And prescient Lawrel, lovely to the Sight: With dancing Leaves the bushy Box appears: Its creeping Trails the winding Ivy rears: And round the friendly Elm the purple Vine adheres.— Hughes alt. Claud. Rapt. Pros. Lib. II. A pleasing Creek Thessalia's Coast can show, Two Arms project, and shape it like a Bow: 'Twould make a Bay, but the transparent Tide Does scarce the yellow-gravell'd Bottom hide: For the quick Eye may thro' the liquid Wave A firm unweedy level Beach perceive. A Grove of fragrant Myrtle near it grows, Whose Boughs, tho' thick, a beauteous Grot disclose: The well-wrought Fabrick, to discerning Eyes, Rather by Art than Nature seems to rise.— Croxall. Ovid. Met. Lib. XI. A Plain diffus'd it's bow'ring Verdure wide, With trembling Pines, which to the Zephyrs sigh'd: Lawrels with Berries crown'd, the Boughs inwove, And the soft Cypress ever whisp'ring Love. Midst these a Brook in winding Murmurs stray'd, Chiding the Pebbles over which it play'd. 'Twas Love's Elysium.— Addison junr. Petron. Arb. Plague. Murrain. Dark Clouds, at first, hung heavy o'er the Earth, Where sluggish Heat lay rip'ning into Birth. While four pale Moons their growing Horns unite, And did again withdraw their feeble Light, Hot baneful Blasts the fatal South-wind blew: The Lakes and Fountains thence infected grew: Millions of Vipers trail'd the Fields untill'd, And all the Rivers with their Venom fill'd. Dogs, Sheep, and Oxen, first, the dire Disease, And Birds, and savage Beasts, did sudden seize: The sorrowing Plowmen with Amazement, spy, The lab'ring Oxen in the Furrows die. The fleecy Flocks with Anguish faintly bleat, Their Wool falls off, they pine away with Heat. The warlike Steed, oppress'd with inward Pain, Forgets his Honours on the dusty Plain: Groans at the Manger, heedless of the Prize, And by a lazy Fate inglorious dies. The Stag forgets his Speed: his Rage the Boar: The Bear insults the horned Herd no more: A general Faintness ev'ry where is spread, And Woods and Fields all labour with the Dead. The Stench infects the Air: and, (strange to say,) Nor Dogs, nor Birds, nor Wolves will touch the Prey. Th' offensive Bodies rot upon the Ground, And spread the dire Contagion all around. The growing Plague gets next among the Swains: Then to the City, where at large it reigns. Internal Heats upon the Vitals seize, And ruddy Spots declare the sad Disease. Their scorching Breath with Pain they scarce expel, Their Tongues turn furry, and with Blisters swel: They gape for Air, believing 'twill abate Their inward Flame: but that augments the Heat. No Bed, no Garment can the Wretches bear, On the hard Ground they lie, in open Air: The Ground no Coolness to their Bodies gives, But glows with Heat which it from them receives. No Drug avails: the dreadful Pest invades The learned Leech, nor Art the Artist aids: Whoe'er most faithfully the Sick attends, Hastes his own Fate, and dies before his Friends. No Hope they have: the Anguish they endure, In Death alone can find a certain Cure. Wherefore from what they fancy none refrain, Nor care what's good, since all their Cares are vain. At Brooks and Streams, regardless of the Shame, Each Sex, promiscuous, strives to quench their Flame: Nor vainly do they strive to quench it there, For Thirst and Life at once extinguish'd are. Down in the Streams the dying Bodies sink, And yet those tainted Waters others drink. Their Beds so much th' unhappy Wretches hate, From thence they fly, to struggle with their Fate: Ev'n those who cannot stand, so weak they're found, Their Bodies roll along upon the Ground: Each from his Home, as Death were there, withdraws, And blames the Place, unknowing of the Cause. Poor ghastly half-dead Creatures may'st Thou meet, Wand'ring they know not where, in ev'ry Street, Untill they faint and fall: with mournful Cries, Others lie on the Earth, their heavy Eyes And Hands rais'd up to Heav'n: but whilst they pray, By Death surpriz'd, they breathe their Souls away. On ev'ry Side, turn where one will the Eye, Spread o'er the Ground the wretched People lie: Like Acorns scatter'd by too rude a Breeze, Or mellow Apples from the shaken Trees. The common fun'ral Honours are unpaid; Nor can the Gates let out the num'rous Dead: But un-interr'd upon the Ground they lie, Or else without Regard to Decency, All Rites of Burial lost, the Bodies burn: Nor pious Tears are shed upon the Urn. The Ghosts of Old and Young, of Sons and Sires, All wander undeplor'd:— Nor Room for Tombs is left, nor Wood for fun'ral Fires.— Sewell. Gay alt. Ovid. Met. Lib. VII. —A Plague from tainted Air Rose, and with all the Fires of Autumn burn'd: Beasts, tame, and savage, of all Species, slew: Poison'd the Rivers: o'er the Pastures spread Contagious Juice.— Oft, standing at the Altar, and with Wreaths And wooly Fillets bound, the Victim Bull, In the mid Honour of the Gods, fell dead Between the ling'ring Sacrificer's Hands. In ev'ry Pasture, on the verdant Grass, The Calves all die: and render their sweet Souls Before the plenteous Racks: the gentle Dogs Run mad: the wheezing Swine with rattling Coughs Are torn, and strangled in their swelling Throats. Unhappy of his Toils, the Victor Steed Sinks, and forgets his Food: and loaths the Streams, And paws the Ground, and hangs his flagging Ears; Bedew'd with doubtful Sweats: and those, near Death, Clammy and cold: his rigid Hide resists The Touch, and harden'd no Impression takes. These Symptoms first; but as the Evil grows More obstinate, and gathers Strength from Time, His Eyes are all inflam'd: from his deep Breast His Breath with Labour heaves: long Sobs and Groans Distend his Entrails: from his Nostrils drops Black ropy Gore: and to his Jaws his Tongue, Clotted with Filth and Putrefaction, cleaves, Smoking beneath the Plow the sturdy Steer Falls down, and spues a Flood of Gore and Foam, And groans his last:—the pensive Hind unyokes His mourning Fellow-Lab'rer, and amidst Th' unfinish'd Furrow leaves the sticking Share. The Wolf no longer, nightly roaming round, Prouls, and explores the Cotts: a sharper Care Subdues him. Now the tim'rous Hinds and Dear Among the Dogs, and round the Houses, rove. Now the vast Ocean's Progeny, and all The finny Race, like Shipwreck'd Bodies thrown Upon the Shore, lie beaten by the Waves: The Phocæ to the wondring Rivers fly: The Viper vainly by her winding Den Defended, and the Snakes, with staring Scales Amaz'd expire.—Ev'n to the Birds the Air Is mortal: and beneath the Clouds aloft They leave their Lives, and headlong fall to Earth. With bleating Sheep and lowing Herds, the Streams, The sloping Mountains, and dry Banks, resound. Now Heaps on Heaps expire: ev'n in the Stalls, And Stables, Carcasses promiscuous lie Rotting in Gore: 'Till, urg'd by that Distress, They learn'd to hide, and bury them in Earth. For of their Skins no use was made: their Flesh No Water could dilute, nor Fire subdue. Nor could they sheer the Fleeces, by the Plague, And running Sores, corrupted: nor ev'n touch, Unhurt, the putrid Wool: or, if they try'd Th' infectious Clothing, fiery Whelks and Blains, And Sweats, of noisome Stench, their Bodies seiz'd: And, in short Space, from that contagious Touch, The sacred Fire their tainted Limbs devour'd.— Trap. Virg. Georg. Lib. III. The rising Grass by trampling Hoofs repell'd, Waste lie the Russet Fields: the gen'rous Steed Seeks on the naked Soil, in vain, to feed: Loathing, from Racks of husky Straw he turns, And, pining for the verdant Pasture, mourns. No more his Limbs his dying Load sustain, Aiming a Stride, he falters in the Strain, And sinks, a Ruin, on the wither'd Plain: Dire Maladies upon his Vitals prey, Dissolve his Frame, and melt the Mass away. Thence mortal Plagues invade the lazy Air, Reek to the Clouds, and hang malignant there: Thence liquid Streams the mingling Plague receive, And deadly Potions to the thirsty give. To Man the Mischief spreads, the fell Disease In fatal Draughts does on his Entrails seize: A rugged Scurf, all loathsome to be seen, Spreads, like a Bark, upon his silken Skin: Malignant Flames his swelling Eye-balls dart, And seem, with Anguish, from their Seats to start: Fires o'er his glowing Cheeks and Visage stray, And mark, in crimson Streaks, their burning Way: Low droops his Head, declining from it's Height, And nods, and totters, with the fatal Weight. With winged Haste the swift Destruction flies, And scarce the Soldier sickens e'er he dies. Now falling Crowds, at once, resign their Breath, And doubly taint the noxious Air with Death. Careless their putrid Carcasses are spread, And on the Earth, their dank unwholesome Bed, The Living rest in common with the Dead. For none the last funereal Rites receive; To be cast forth the Camp is all their Friends can give.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. VI. A Fatal Fever laid Achaia waste, Thro' ev'ry Street, in ev'ry Town it pass'd; From Egypt's Coasts the dire Distemper came, And with the Air diffus'd the deadly Flame: The raging Pest at last to Athens spread, Where Heaps on Heaps were number'd with the Dead. First fierce unusual Heats attack'd the Head, The glowing Eyes, with blood-shot Beams, look'd red: The Mouth and Jaws were fill'd with clotted Blood, Sore Ulcers seiz'd the Throat,— And putrid Gore the speaking Tongue o'erflow'd: Whence feeble, hard to move, and rough it grew.— When from the Mouth, advancing thro' the Breast, The dire Disease the heaving Heart possess'd, Then Life began to fail: then too the Breath Stunk like a Corpse, and told approaching Death. With raging Pains were joyn'd tormenting Care, And racking Anguish, Groanings, and Despair: Complaints, continual Sobs, and deep-drawn Sighs, Fatigue beyond the Strength, dissolve the Ties Of Soul and Body:—and the Patient dies.— Creech alt. Lucret. Lib. VI. Such Plagues Achaia felt; the fierce Disease Laid Athens waste, and spoil'd the Town in Peace. It bore the helpless Nation to the Grave, No Physick could assist, no Vows could save: Heaps fell on Heaps, and while they gasp'd for Breath, Heaps fell on those, and finish'd half their Death. None nurs'd the Sick: the nearest Kinsmen fled; None stay'd to bury, or to mourn the Dead. The Fires grown weary, dy'd beneath their Spoils, And heap'd-up Limbs supply'd the Place of Piles. Vast Emptiness and Desolation reign'd, And to a Nation scarce an Heir remain'd.— Creech. Manil. Lib. I. Infections, from one single Case begun, Soon spread their Poison, and thro' Numbers run.

The silver Moon o'er briny Seas presides, And heaves huge Ocean with alternate Tides. Saturn's cold Rays prevail beneath the Pole: And o'er the Winds and Thunders Mars bears rule. Where Jove ascends, the Skies are still serene: And fruitful Venus is the genial Queen: While ev'ry limpid Spring, and rolling Stream, Submits to Mercury's o'er-ruling Beam.— Rowe alter'd. Lucan. Lib. X. Pleasure. Pleasure in Cloth of Gold and Purple Dye, With glaring Lustre overwhelms the Eye: Ambrosial Fragrance from her Locks exhales, And in her Breath are all Arabia's Gales: Her Beauty shines with ev'ry Help of Art, That can allure, and captivate the Heart. Her sparkling Eyes in sprightly Motions dance, And dart lascivious Flames at ev'ry Glance.— Addis. alt. —A different Dress did Virtue wear: Rude from her Forehead fell th' unplaited Hair: With dauntless Mein aloft she rear'd her Head, And next to manly was the Virgin's Tread: Her Height, her sprightly Blush, the Goddess show, And Robes, unsullied, as the falling Snow.— Sil. Ital. Lib. XV. No mortal Bliss does ever come sincere, Pleasure may lead, but Grief brings up the Rear.— Ovid. Met. L. VII. Plunder. Now in the empty Isles of Juno's Fane Phœnix, and dire Ulysses, chosen Guards, Watch o'er the Prey. There Trojan Treasure snatch'd From burning Shrines, the Tables of the Gods, Goblets of massy Gold, and captive Robes, Lie pil'd in Heaps: Children, and trembling Dames, Rank'd in long Rows, stand round.— Trap. Æn. Lib. II. Then, while his glowing Fortune yet was warm, And scatt'ring Terror spread the wild Alarm, Swift to the hostile Camp he bent his Way, And led the Soldier greedy to the Prey. Behold, he cries, our Victory compleat, The glorious Recompence attends You yet: Much have You done to Day for Cœsar's sake; 'Tis mine to shew the Prey, 'tis your's to take: 'Tis your's, whate'er the vanquish'd Foe has left, 'Tis what your Valour gain'd, and not my Gift. Treasures immense yon wealthy Tents infold, The Gems of Asia, and Hesperian Gold. For You the once great Pompey's Store attends, With regal Spoils of his Barbarian Friends: Haste then, prevent the Foe, and seize that Good, For which you paid so well with Roman Blood. He said: and with the Rage of Rapine stung, The Multitude tumultuous rush along. On Swords, and Spears, on Sires and Sons they tread, And all remorseless spurn the gory Dead. What Trench can intercept, what Fort withstand The brutal Soldier's rude rapacious Hand, When eager to his Crime's Reward he flies, And bath'd in Blood, demands the horrid Prize? There Wealth collected from the World around, The destin'd Recompence of War, they found. Then in Patrician Tents Plebeians rest, And regal Couches are by Ruffians press'd.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. VII. Poetaster. A mad Dog's Foam, th' Infection of the Plague, And all the Judgments of the angry Gods Are not avoided more by Men of Sense, Than Poetasters in their raging Fits.— Roscommon. Hor. Art. Poet. 'Tis hard to say, whether for Sacriledge, Or Incest, or some more unheard-of Crime, The rhyming Fiend is sent into these Men: But they are all most visibly possess'd: And like a baited Bear when he breaks loose, Without Distinction seize on all they meet: Learn'd, or unlearn'd, none 'scape within their Reach, (Sticking like Leeches 'till they burst with Blood,) Without Remorse insatiably they read, And never leave 'till they have read Men dead.— Id. Ibid. Suffenus, whom You know, the witty, The gay, the talkative, and pretty: And, all his Wonders to rehearse, The Thing which makes a World of Verse: I'm certain I should not belie him, To say he 'as sev'ral Thousands by him, Yet none deform'd with critic Blot, Or wrote on Vellum to rub out. Royal Paper! Scarlet Strings! Gilded Backs! and such fine Things! But—when you read 'em, then the witty Gay Suffenus, and the pretty, Is the dullest heaviest Clown, So alter'd he can scarce be known. This is strange, that He, who now, Could so flatter, laugh, and bow, So much Wit, such Breeding show, Should be so ungenteel a Wight, Whenever he attempts to write. And yet the Wretch is ne'er so pleas'd, As when he's with this Madness seiz'd.— Anon. Catul. Poetry. See Poet. Style. Orpheus, by Harmony divine, subdu'd Man's savage Nature, and his Thirst of Blood: For this the sacred Bard was said t'asswage The Tyger's Fury, and the Lion's Rage: And when Amphion built the Theban Wall, 'Twas feign'd the list'ning Stones obey'd his Musick's Call. Verse was contrived then to make Folks wise, To cherish Virtue, and discourage Vice: To sep'rate Actions sacred and prophane, Suppress wild Lust, and link the nuptial Chain: Tow'rs it plann'd out, and instituted Laws. Hence Bards were call'd divine, and Verse acquir'd Applause.— Ames alter'd. Hor. de Art. Poet. Poems (like Pictures) are of diff'rent Sorts: Some better at a Distance, others near: Some love the Dark, some chuse the clearest Light, And boldly challenge the most piercing Eye: Some please for once, some will for ever please.— Roscommon. Hor. Art. Po. Some think that Poets may be form'd by Art, Others maintain that Nature makes them so: I neither see what Art without a Vein, Nor Wit, without the Help of Art, can do: But mutually they need each other's Aid.— Roscommon.Now some dispute, to which the greatest Part A Poem owes, to Nature, or to Art: But Troth, to speak my Thoughts, I hardly know, What witless Art, or artless Wit can do. Each by itself is vain, I'm sure: but join'd, Their Force is strong, each proves the other's Friend.— Creech. Hor. Art. Poet. Whoe'er would form a valuable Poem, Must rigorously discharge the Censor's Part, And dare reject whatever Words appear Or void of Elegance, or Weight, or Worth; Tho' fashionable, tho' rever'd they be. Words our Forefathers us'd, if apt and just, Tho' obsolete, and to our Ears uncouth, He must revive, and bring to Light again. Such new Expressions let him authorize As Custom shall produce: and with fresh Stores Inrich his Mother Tongue, till it becomes Like some fam'd River, flowing, full, and clear. Whate'er's redundant let him wisely prune: Soften what's harsh; reject what is unfit; And turn, and wind, and work them ev'ry Way. Hor. Lib. II. Ep. 2. What is the Verse in Vogue?—When Numbers flow, Soft without Sense, and without Spirit slow: So smooth and equal that no Sight can find The Passage where the polish'd Piece was joyn'd. So even all, with such a steady View, As if he shut one Eye to level true. Whether the vulgar Vice his Passion stings, The People's Riots, or the Rage of Kings: The gentle Poet is alike in all: The Reader hopes no Rise, and fears no Fall.— Dryden. Pers. Sat. I. Poets. Let me for once presume t' instruct the Times, To know the Poet from the Man of Rhimes: 'Tis He who gives my Breast a thousand Pains, Can make me feel each Passion that he feigns, Enrage, compose, with more than magic Art, With Pity, and with Terror, tare my Heart: And snatch me o'er the Earth, or thro' the Air, To Thebes, to Athens, when he will, and where.— Pope. Hor. Lib. I. Epist. 2. The Good to cherish, Friends to reconcile: The Furious to restrain, and love the Man Who fears a wicked Deed: Temp'rance to praise; Strict Justice, and his Country's Laws support: To preach up sacred Hospitality, And to conceal, not aggravate Mistakes, Becomes the Poet.—He too implores the Gods To raise the wretched, and the Proud pull down.— Hor. Art. Poet. What seeks the Poet for, but only Fame? Nought crowns his Labours but an empty Name. By Kings and Heroes, as old Authors shew, Poets, in ancient Times,— Were lov'd, protected, and rewarded too. Then to the Name much Rev'rence was allow'd, And they with rich Possessions were endow'd. Ennius with Honours was by Scipio grac'd, And, next his own, the Poet's Statue plac'd. But now their ivy Crowns bear no Esteem, And all their Learning's thought an idle Dream.— Congreve alter'd. Ovid. Art. Lib. III. No Fraud the Poet's sacred Breast can bear, Mild are his Manners, and his Heart sincere: Nor Wealth he seeks, nor feels Ambition's Fires, But shuns the Bar, and Books and Shades requires. —Our softer Studies with our Souls combine, And, both, to Tenderness our Hearts incline: Something divine is in Us, and from Heav'n Th' inspiring Spirit can alone be giv'n.— Congreve. Ibid. Painters and Poets have been still allow'd Their Pencils and their Fancies unconfin'd.— Roscom. Hor. Art. A Poet should inform us, or divert: But joyning both he shews his greatest Art.— Ibid. Poets may take a boundless Liberty, Nor are confin'd to Truths in History.— Ov. III. Am. II. But let whate'er of Fiction, You bring in, Be so like Truth, to seem, at least, a-kin.— Hor. Art. Learn'd or unlearn'd we write:—we're Poets all. But this Mistake, a Madness tho' it be, Produces such good Qualities as these: The Poet's Soul is free from Avarice The Muse his Mistress, her alone he courts: And laughs at Losses, Robberies, or Fires. His Friend he will not cheat, nor wrong his Ward. Contentedly he lives on homely Fare: And tho' unactive, and for War unfit, At home he dwells, a useful Citizen. Great Things are brought about by humble Means: Youth's stammering Tongue the Poet forms to Speech: From leud Expressions guards the tender Ears, And generous Precepts pours into the Soul, Correcting Envy, Savageness, and Rage. Facts rightly he relates: the rising Age With great Examples fires: the Sick revives, And to the Wretched Consolation brings.— Hor. Lib. II. Epist. 1. —Whoever joins Instruction with Delight Pleasure with Profit, is most surely right. Most Poets fall into the grossest Faults, Deluded by a seeming Excellence. By striving to be short, they grow obscure: And when they would write smoothly, they want Strength, Their Spirits sink: while Others, that affect A lofty Stile, swell to a Tympany. Some tim'rous Wretches start at ev'ry Blast, And fearing Tempests, dare not leave the Shore: Others in love with wild Variety, Draw Boars in Waves, and Dolphins in a Wood. Thus fear of erring, joyn'd with want of Skill, Is the most certain Way of erring still.— Roscommon. Hor. Art Poet. If I discern not the true Stile, and Air, Nor how to give the proper Character To ev'ry Kind of Work, how dare I claim, And challenge to myself a Poet's Name?— Ibid. But he, whose noble Genius is allow'd, Who with stretch'd Pinions soars above the Crowd, Who mighty Thought can cloath with manly Dress, He, whom I fancy, but can ne'er express: Such, such a Wit, tho' rarely to be found, Must be secure from Want, if not abound: Easy and Quiet in his Mind must be, From Care, from Bus'ness, and from Trouble free. He must have Groves, and lonely Fountains chuse, And pleasing Solitudes to bait his Muse; Unvex'd with Thought of Wants which may betide, Or for to Morrow's Dinner to provide. Horace ne'er wrote but with a rosy Cheek, Full were his Pockets, and his Sides were sleek. A Wit should have no Care, or this alone, To make his rising Numbers justly run.— Dryden jun. Juv. Sat. VII. Policy of State. To strictest Maxims of Pothinus, Privy-Counsellor to Ptolemy King of Egypt. Justice many Ills belong, And Honesty is often in the Wrong: Chiefly when stubborn Rules her Zealots push, To favour those whom Fortune means to crush. But thou, Oh royal Ptolemy! be wise: Change with the Gods, and fly whom Fortune flies. Not Earth from yon high Heav'n which we admire, Not from the watry Element the Fire, Are sever'd by Distinctions half so wide, As Int'rest and Integrity divide. The mighty Pow'r of Kings no more prevails, When Justice comes with her deciding Scales: Freedom for all Things, and a lawless Sword, Alone support an arbitrary Lord. He that is cruel, must be bold in Ills, And find his Safety from the Blood he spills. For Piety, and Virtue's starving Rules, To mean Retirements let 'em lead their Fools: There may they still ingloriously be good: None can be safe in Courts, who blush at Blood. The Prudent on the Prosp'rous still depends, And, none but Fools, chuse Wretches for their Friends.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. VIII. Trust not a Pow'r accustom'd to be Great, And vers'd in wicked Policies of State. Old Kings long harden'd in the regal Trade, By Int'rest and by Craft alone are sway'd: But new Ones make some Conscience of their Trust, And to their People are benign and just.— Id. Ibid. Popularity. Careful to purchase popular Applause, And gain the giddy Vulgar to his Cause: He knew the constant Practice of the Great, That those who court the Vulgar, bid them eat. When pinch'd with Want, all Rev'rence they withdraw: For hungry Multitudes obey no Law. Thus therefore Factions make their Parties good, And buy Authority and Pow'r with Food.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. III. Portents. Prodigies. See Omens. The Gods can't alter Fate's resistless Will: But They, by Signs, foretell th' approaching Ill. Dreadful were heard, among the Clouds, Alarms Of ecchoing Trumpets, and of clashing Arms. The Sun's pale Image gave so faint a Light, That the sad Earth was almost veil'd in Night. The starry Sky with fiery Meteors glow'd, And with the Rain were mingled Drops of Blood, A dusky Hue the Morning Star o'erspread, And the Moon's Orb was stain'd with Spots of Red. In ev'ry Place portentous Shrieks were heard, The fatal Warnings of th' infernal Bird: In ev'ry Place the Marble melts to Tears: While in the Groves, rever'd thro' length of Years, Boding and aweful Sounds the Ear invade, And solemn Music warbles thro' the Shade. No Victims can the Wrath of Heav'n asswage: The Intrails of the Sacrifice presage Our Head cut off, and Tumult, War, and Rage. Around each hallow'd Shrine, and sacred Dome, Night-howling Dogs disturb the peaceful Gloom: Their silent Seats the wandring Shades forsake, And fearful Tremblings the rock'd City shake.— Welsted. Ovid. Met. Lib. XV. The Sun, at Cæsar's Murder, pitying Rome, With dusky Scurf obscur'd his beamy Head, And impious Mortals fear'd eternal Night. Tho' at that Time Earth too, and spacious Seas, And Dogs obscene, and ill-presaging Birds Gave dire Portents. How oft have we beheld Loud thund'ring Ætna from Volcanos burst, Deluge with liquid Fire Cyclopean Fields, And toss huge Balls of Flame, and molten Stones? O'er all the Sky Germania heard the Clank Of Arms: Unusual shudd'rings rock'd the Alps: And oft in silent Woods were Voices more Than human heard: And Spectres wondrous pale Seen in the Dusk of Ev'ning: Oxen spoke, (Horrid to tell!) Earth yawn'd, and Streams stood still: In Temples mourning Iv'ry wept: and Brass Sweated: Eridanus, supreme of Rivers, With roaring Inundation, o'er the Plains, Swept Woods away, and Cattle, with their Stalls. Nor did, mean-while, th' ill-boding Fibres cease To menace Fate: nor Blood to rise in Wells: Nor Cities loudly to resound with Wolves Howling by Night. Ne'er, from unclouded Sky, Did Lightnings with more nimble Flashes glare: Nor e'er so thick did baleful Comets blaze.— Trap. Georg. Lib. I. The Gods by dreadful Omens straight disclos'd The deathful Horrors of approaching Fate. The Sun in gloomy Clouds obscur'd his Rays, As if he mourn'd our civil Wars begun: While trembling Cynthia fled the impious Sight, Hid her full Orb, and from the World withdrew. Mountains by sudden Storms were over-turn'd: And erring Rivers left their Channels dry. The Noise of Armour rattles thro' the Air, And from the Clouds shrill Trumpets sound a Charge. Fierce Ætna belches forth uncommon Fires, And darts it's Lightnings upwards to the Skies. Unbury'd Ghosts wander amongst the Tombs, With horrid Screams denouncing dreadful Woes. A fiery Comet shakes it's blazing Hair: And wond'ring Jove descends in Show'rs of Blood.— Addis. jun. Petron. Arb. Portion. See Wife. The Darts of Venus and her Torch He scorns; The Fortune charms him: 'tis for that he burns.— Dryden. Juv. Sat. VII. What the World calls a Portion with a Wife, I boast not of as such: But Chastity, Becoming Shame, and moderate Desires: My Fear of Heav'n, my Fondness of my Parents, My Friendship and Regard for our Relations, The Course of my Behaviour towards Yourself: My Bounty to the Good, and my Concern To cherish Virtue, and reward the Virtuous.— Plaut. Amph. A virtuous Ancestry, a Mind so chaste, So strictly faithful to the nuptial Tye, It dreads the Thought of any other Man: These are an ample Portion with a Wife.— Hor. Lib. III. Od. 24. Poverty. Disgraceful Poverty does Man expose To suffer Life's severest Woes, And act the worst of Crimes:—far, far astray It leads from rigid Virtue's Way.— Hor. Lib. III. Od. 24. Observe what Cash a Person has in Store, Just so much Credit has he, and no more: Should'st Thou upon a thousand Bibles swear, And call each Saint throughout the Kalendar To vouch thy Oath, it won't be taken here. The Poor slight Heav'n and Thunder-bolts, we think, And Heav'n itself does at such Trifles wink.— Dryden. Juv. Sat. X. Nothing, in Poverty, so ill is born, As its exposing Men to grinning Scorn.— Ibid. Rarely they rise by Virtue's Aid, who lie Plung'd in the Depth of helpless Poverty.— Ibid. Codrus was a learned Man, very poor, and by his Books supposed to be a Poet. Codrus had but one Bed, so short to boot, That his short Wife's short Legs hung dangling out: His Cupboard's Head six earthen Pitchers grac'd; Beneath 'em was his trusty Tankard plac'd: And to support this noble Plate, there lay A bending Chiron cast from honest Clay. His few Greek Books a rotten Chest contain'd, Whose Covers much of Mouldiness complain'd: Where Mice and Rats devour'd poetic Bread, And with heroic Verse luxuriantly were fed. 'Tis true, poor Codrus Nothing had to boast, And yet poor Codrus all that Nothing lost: Begg'd naked thro' the Streets of wealthy Rome, And found not one, to feed, or take him home.— Dryd. Juv. Sat. III. Courts to the Poor are shut: Wealth Honour gains, And Wealth gets Friends: but each the Poor disdains.— Ovid. Eleg. Therefore, Father, since our Circumstances are but indifferent, it's our best Way to live modestly and sparingly: for should an ill Reputation be added to our Poverty, it would make our Poverty still more grievous, and endanger our Honesty.— Plaut. Pers. Poyson. Like red-hot Steel in Water drench'd, his Blood Hiss'd with the Venom, all one boiling Flood: Now with the greedy Flame his Entrails glow, And livid Sweats down all his Body flow: The cracking Nerves, burnt up, are burst in twain, The lurking Venom melts his swimming Brain.— Gay. Ovid. Met. Lib. IX. The craving Wife the Force of Magic tries, And Philters for th' unable Husband buys: The Potion works not on the Part design'd, But turns his Brain, and stupifies his Mind. A long Oblivion, a benumbing Frost, Constrains his Head, and Yesterday is lost.— Dryden. Juv. Sat. VI. Praise. While Rivers seek the Sea, while Shades surround The Mountains Sides, while Ether feeds the Stars: Your Honour, Name, and Praise shall ever live— Trap. Æn. I. O Great in Fame, but far more Great in Arms, Brave Trojan Chief! what Praises shall I chuse To equal Thee with Heav'n? what shall I first Admire? Thy Justice? or thy Deeds in War?— Id. Æn. Lib. XI. When Fame to count thy Acts and Years proceeds, Thy Years appear but Cyphers to thy Deeds! For Thee, brave Youth! as for our Common-Wealth, We pray: and drink, in yours, the public Health. Your Praise the Nobles and Plebeians sing, With your lov'd Name the Court and Cottage ring: 'Tis You alone make all the People glad; And not a Soul in this vast City's sad.— Tate. Ovid. Met. Lib. VII. As of the Trees the Glory is the Vine: Grapes of the Vine: of Herds, the Bull: the Corn Of fertile Fields: so Thou of all the Swains.— Trap. Virg. Ecl. V. While Boars love Mountain Tops, while Fish the Streams: While Bees suck Thyme, while Grashoppers the Dew: Thy Honour, Name, and Praise shall ever live.— Id. Ibid. As the tough Willow to the Olive yields, The Cowslip to the crimson Rose: so much Amyntas, in my Judgment, yields to Thee.— Id. Ibid. Prayers. See Wishes. Of all our Vows, the first and chief Request, Of each, is to be richer than the rest: And yet no Doubts the poor Man's Draught controul; He dreads no Poyson in his homely Bowl. Then fear the deadly Drug, when Gems divine Enchase the Cup, and sparkle in the Wine.— Dryden. Juv. Sat. X. O, Grant me Length of Life, and Years good Store Heap on my Head, Great Jove! I ask no more. Thus, with a bold Assurance dost Thou pray, Tho' pale, for fear the God should say Thee nay. And yet what Ills continually a-wait Helpless old Age, that miserable State!— Id. alter'd. Ibid. To thy good Genius pour the sparkling Wine, And pray:—thy Pray'rs will stand the Test of Heav'n; Nor need'st Thou take the Gods aside to hear 'em. But many of the Great in Silence burn Their costly Incense: for 'tis not convenient, That ev'ry one should from the Temple bring, The Pray'r he whispers, to the public Ear.— Grant me Good-nature, give me Fame, Great Jove! And make me honest:—thus, the Knave aloud Cries out, for to be heard:—but to himself Inly he mutters;—O, would'st Thou but deign To take away my wealthy Unkle's Life! Or else,—O Hercules! would'st Thou vouchsafe To guide my Rake upon the chinking Sound Of some vast Treasure!—Or,—Behold the Wretch, My Ward, how scabby and unsound he is; Could I but tip him off, th' Estate were mine. Or,—This is happy Nereus's third Wife: Oh could I be so lucky!—Thus thou pray'st: And, wickedly devout, at early Dawn, Thrice dost Thou plunge Thyself in Tyber's Stream, To purge away the Night's Impurities. But, prithee tell me, ('tis a small Request,) What Thou believ'st of Jove?—Is he, dost think, To be preferr'd to Man?—To Man! What Man?— Why Staius was a most corrupt and wicked Judge: He likewise poisoned his Brother and his Brother's Wife. Staius let's suppose; for he's the worst.— Now art thou doubtful whether of the two, Staius, or Jove, would prove the trustier Guardian, Or make the better Judge?— But come, let's try:—unfold to Staius strait What to Jove's Ear thou boldly didst impart; Staius will cry, O righteous Jupiter! Canst thou bear this!—And will not Jove himself, Dost think, exclaim, and rise to just Revenge? Because his Thunder splits some ancient Oak, And is not darted at thy House and Thee: Nor ly'st thou dead, sad Object! in the Grove, Struck down, amidst thy Sacrifice, ev'n whilst The pious Priest performs the sacred Rites: Therefore thou fanciest Jove thy Crime forgives, And tamely lets thee take him by the Beard. But by what Gifts dost Thou pretend to bribe The Gods, to heat thy wicked Pray'rs, unpunish'd? Can thy fat Off'rings their just Wrath appease?— Pers. Sat. II. Pray to the Gods: but be thy Pray'rs confin'd To Health of Body, and Content of Mind. Pray for a Soul that dares grim Death defy, And count it Nature's Priviledge to die: Serene, and manly, hardned to sustain The Load of Life, and exercis'd in Pain: Guiltless of Rage, and Proof against Desire, That all Things weighs, and nothing can admire: That dares prefer the Toils of Hercules, To Dalliance, Banquets, and ignoble Ease.— Dryden alt. Juv. Sat. X. Presumption. Bold Man, that all Things dares essay, Thro' Crimes forbidden makes his Way: Bold Japhet's Race, of Humankind The Curse, celestial Fire purloin'd: The Fire celestial ill-obtain'd, Strait, the wan ling'ring Pthisis reign'd; Came Fevers, with pestif'rous Breath, A spotted Legion! and slow Death, Far off before, tho' sure decreed, Catch'd up his Steps, and march'd with Speed: Presumptuous Dædalus! he try'd Thro' Air, with Wings to Man deny'd, To journey: Rash Alcmena's Son The Barriers broke of Acheron: To Deeds stupendous Mortals rise: We e'en in Folly brave the Skies: Nor suffer Jove, thro' stubborn Pride, To lay th' uplifted Bolt aside.— Welsted. Hor. Lib. I. Od. 3. Pride. See Boasting. —Surrounded with a courtly Guard, The royal Niobè in State appear'd: Array'd in Robes embroider'd o'er with Gold, And mad with Rage; yet lovely to behold: Her beauteous Tresses, o'er her Shoulders spread, Wav'd with becoming Grace, whene'er she mov'd her Head. Then, darting round a proud disdainful Look, In haughty Tone her hasty Passion broke, And thus began: What Madness this, to court A Goddess founded merely on Report? Dare ye Latona's fancy'd Power invoke, While yet no Altars to my Godhead smoke?— Croxall alt. Ov. Met. Lib. VI. Where e'er around I turn my wond'ring Eyes, My Riches glitter, and my Treasures rise: Add too, th'unequall'd Beauties of my Face, Whose Charms celestial might a Goddess grace. My Happiness beyond all Doubt is fixt, And with no Tincture of Misfortune mixt: My Plenty guards me against future Ill, And spite of Fortune I'll be happy still: I stand superior to her giddy Power; For tho' she much may take, she still must leave me more.— Id. alt. Ibid. Narcissus many a blooming Youth caress'd, And many a Maid her Love for him confess'd: Yet tho' his Form was soft, his Pride was such, That Youth, nor Maid, his haughty Heart could touch. Ovid. Met. Lib. III. Whilst the old Frog was gone to range abroad, An Ox came by, and on her young ones trod. One 'scap'd, and told her, that a monstrous Beast Had trampled on her Young, and kill'd the rest. How large, says she; As large as I am now? And swells:—Yes, yes, 'twas twice as large as You. What! larger still? and then she swells again. Ay, larger much, and you contend in vain: Forbear your Swelling, for you cannot be, Tho' you should burst yourself, as large as he.— Creech alt. Hor. Lib. II. Sat. 3. Procession. See Majesty. Mean while a mournful supplicating Train Of Trojan Matrons, to Minerva's Fane In sad Procession with a Veil repair, Beat their white Breasts, and rend their flowing Hair. Unmov'd with Pray'rs, disdainfully she frown'd, And fixt her Eyes, relentless, on the Ground,— Pitt. Æn. Lib. I. Mean while the Queen to Pallas' stately Dome Amidst a num'rous Quire of Matrons, rode, And Off'rings bore: Lavinia by her Side, The Royal Virgin, Cause of all their Woe: Her beauteous Eyes cast down, and bent on Earth. The Matrons follow: and with Incense sweet Perfume the Temple: and with mournful Sound Thus from the stately Entrance breath their Pray'r. Tritonian Virgin! Arbitress of War! Break with thy Pow'r the Phrygian Pirate's Lance: And Him lay prone extended on the Ground, And roll his Trunk beneath the lofty Gates.— Trap. Æn. Lib. XI. Prosperity. See Fortune. Who thinks that Fortune cannot change her Mind, Prepares a dreadful Jest for all Mankind! And who stands safest, tell me? is it he That spreads and swells with puff'd Prosperity, Or, blest with little, who preventing Care, In Peace provides fit Arms against a War?— Pope. Hor. II. Sat. 2. O Mortals! blind in Fate, who never know To bear high Fortune, or endure the low.— Dryden. Virg. Æn. X. When Fortune smiles, hold not your Head too high: Nor sink, desponding, in Adversity.— Perian. per Aus. —Ill Fortune still reveals The Temper of the Mind, which good conceals.— Hor. II. Sat. 8. A Mind at Ease may easily be won, As Corn delights in Fields blest by the Sun. When Fortune's Favours make the Soul rejoice, The Mind is open to Perswasion's Voice.— Ovid. Art. Lib. I. Tho' Fortune smiles, and swells thy Mind, It gilds, but cannot change thy Kind.— Creech. Hor Epod. IV. No one's belov'd, but he whom Fortune favours.— Ov. II. Pon. 3. Whom Fortune's Favours over much delight, Her Frowns will terrify with great Affright.— Hor. Lib. I. Epist. 10. When every Thing goes on prosperously, People should consider how to behave themselves in Cases of Adversity: such as Dangers, Losses, Banishment.— Ter. Phor. Providence. See Chance. Fate. God. I'll sing, how God, the World's Almighty Soul, Fills Heav'n, and Earth, and Seas, and sways the Whole; Each Part disposes with an equal Hand, While subject Nature bends to his Command: How all by Reason moves: because one Mind Does all pervade, and all together bind.— For did not all the friendly Parts conspire To make one Whole, and keep the Frame entire: And did not Wisdom's constant Laws controul That vast stupendious Machine of the Whole, The Earth would lose it's Place; the Skies would fall; And want of Motion prove the Bane of all: No more the Stars would roll; nor Day, nor Night, By turns, each other fly, and put to Flight:— Rains would not chear the Earth; nor Winds supply Mists to the Clouds, and Vapours to the Sky: Nor Seas would fill the Springs, nor Springs return A grateful Tribute from their flowing Urn: Nor would the All, unless contriv'd by Art, So justly be proportion'd in each Part, That neither Seas, nor Skies, nor Stars exceed Our Wants, nor are too scanty for our Need. Thus stands the Frame, and one Almighty Soul Thro' all diffus'd, so turns and guides the Whole, That Nothing from it's settled Station swerves: Motion, not alters, but the World preserves.— Creech alt. Manil. Lib. II. The Stars still keep one Course: they still pursue Their constant Track, nor vary in a new: From one fixt Point they start: their Course maintain: Repeat their Whirl, and visit it again: A most convincing Reason drawn from Sense, That this vast Frame is rul'd by Providence: Which, like the Soul, does every Whirl advance: It must be God, nor was it made by Chance, As Epicurus dream'd: who madly thought This beauteous Frame of senseless Atoms wrought; That Seas, and Earth, the Stars, and spacious Air, What forms new Worlds, or does the old repair, First rose from These, by These supply'd remain: And All must be, when Chance shall break the Chain, Dissolv'd to these wild Principles again. Absurd, and Nonsense! Atheist, use thine Eyes, And having view'd the Order of the Skies, Think, if Thou canst, that Matter blindly hurl'd, Without a Guide should frame this wondrous World.— Creech. Manil. Lib. I. Receive my Council, and securely move; Instruct thy Fortune to the Pow'rs above: Leave them to manage for thee, and to grant What their unerring Wisdom sees thee Want: In Goodness as in Greatness they excell: Ah! that we lov'd Ourselves but half so well! We, by our headstrong Passions blindly led, Are hot for Action, and desire to wed: Then wish for Heirs:—but, to the Gods alone Our future Offspring, and our Wives, are known.— Dryd. Juv. Sat. X. On human Prudence safely none depend, For ill Advice Success does oft attend: Fortune but seldom Merit's Side approves, But here and there without Distinction roves. So that some greater over-ruling Cause Subjects all mortal Things to it's appointed Laws.— Creech alt. Manil. Lib. IV. Purgation of Souls, and their return into Bodies. —Æneas sees A Grove, secluded, in a secret Vale, Shrubs rattling in the Woods, and Lethe's Stream, Which near the peaceful Mansions glides along: Round which unnumber'd Crowds, and Nations flew. As when the Bees in Meads, while Summer shines, On various Flowers alight, and hover o'er The Snow-white Lillies: all the Field resounds With humming Noise.—Struck at the sudden Sight, Surpriz'd, and ignorant, Æneas asks The Cause: enquires, what River That? and who The thronging Ghosts that crouded to the Shore? Anchises then: Those Souls, to whom by Fate New Bodies are decreed, at Lethe's Stream Drink long Oblivion from the drowsy Waves. O Father, is it then to be conceiv'd, That any of these Spirits so sublime, Would go to upper Light, and re-assume Their sluggish Bodies? whence such fond Desire, Such miserable Love of wretched Life? Yes; all, my Son, to thee I will explain, Replies Anchises.— First, Plato's system. Heaven, and Earth, and Oceans liquid Plains, The Moon's bright Globe, the Sun, and shining Stars, A Soul within enlivens: and a Mind Diffus'd thro' all it's Parts, the gen'ral Mass Invigorates, and mingles with the Whole. Hence Men, and Beasts, and all the feather'd Kind Proceed, and Monsters of the boundless Deep. A fiery Force and Origine divine These Seeds inspires: so far as not controul'd By their terrestrial Bodies, clog'd and damp'd By their dull Flesh, and cumbrous mortal Frame. Hence they desire, and fear, rejoice, and grieve: Nor see the Light, in Prison dark confin'd Nor, ev'n when Life is fled, do all their Ills, And all their Pests corporeal wear away: But many Stains, in such a Length of Time Contracted, marvellously must inhere. Therefore with Punishment they are explor'd, And pay due Penance for their former Crimes. Some hang expanded to the empty Winds: The Guilt, ingrain'd, of Other's in th' Abyss Of Seas is wash'd: or burnt away with Fire. Each of Us from our several These Manes are understood by many to mean the Furies, or infernal Tormentors, which punish the Souls in Hell: as may be inferred from Georg. IV. 489. Scirent si'ignoscere Manes. Trap Manes bear Purgation: to Elysium then we go, And here We few enjoy these blissful Fields. When tract of Time (it's fatal Round at length Revolv'd) has quite work'd off the blended Stain, Leaving defecated th' etherial Ray, And simple Energy of heav'nly Fire: All These (the Circle of a thousand Years Compleat) the God to Lethe's River calls Assembl'd: that, forgetful of the past, They may return to Life, and re-ascend, Contented, to their first embodied State.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. VI. Race. They take their Places: And, the Signal giv'n, Fleet as a Tempest, spring at once, and leave The Bounds, fly o'er the Field, and mark the Goal. Nisus the first, and long before the rest, Swift shoots away: more swift than Winds, or Wings Of Light'ning.—Next, but far at Distance next, Him Salius follows: Near to Him, the Third Euryalus—. Him Elymus succeeds: Whom pressing close, Diores flies: and justles Heel with Heel, Imminent o'er his Shoulder: and had Room More wide been giv'n him, foremost he had sprung, Or left him doubtful.—Now They panting reach'd The utmost Line, and almost touch'd the Goal: When Nisus, sliding on the slipp'ry Gore, Which there by chance, from Oxen slain, besmear'd The Ground and verdant Grass, his tott'ring Steps Could not support: but now, ev'n Victor, fell, Prone in the Mire obscene, and sacred Blood, Unfortunate: Yet not unmindful Then Of Friendship, and Euryalus, oppos'd Himself to Salius, from the slipp'ry Place Rising: He, tumbling on the clotted Sand, Extended lay: Euryalus springs on, And, Victor by th' Assistance of his Friend, Comes in the first, with Shouts, and mix'd Applause. Trap. Æn. Lib. V. Rage. See Anger. Arms, Arms, my Friends: Tho' vanquish'd, This last Day Calls us to Arms: Give me the Greeks again: Off:—let me go:—I'll see the Eight renew'd: This Day We will not all die unreveng'd.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. II. Soon as the Dido. Queen perceiv'd the dawning Day, And from a Tower beheld the Navy move With even Sails, the empty Ports, and Shores Abandon'd: with repeated Blows she beats Her beauteous Breast, and rends her yellow Hair: Shall he then go? The Fugitive? O Jove! She cry'd, and make my Kingdoms thus his Sport? Will they not rush to Arms? from all the Town Pursue? While Others from the Docks swift plunge My Ships into the Sea? Go, fly: bring Fire: Quick, hoise your Sails, and strongly ply your Oars. What was't I said? where am I? what Distraction Has turn'd my Brain?—Unhappy Dido! now Thy cruel Fate stabs home.— Id. Æn. Lib. IV. Thus wild He raves: and from his smoking Mouth Burst Sparks of Fire, and Flashes from his Eyes. So hideous roars the Bull with previous Rage, And practices the Fight: against an Oak Whetting his Horns, he pushes empty Air, And spurns the Sand, preluding to the War.— Id. Æn. XII. When Turnus saw the harrass'd Latins faint With unsuccessful War: his Promise claim'd: Himself mark'd out, and by all Eyes observ'd: Conscious of inborn Worth he burns with Rage Implacable, and rouses all his Fire. The lordly Lion thus, on Lybia's Plains, Gor'd by the Hunter's Spear within his Breast Infix'd, at length springs furious to the Fight, And shakes with dreadful Pride his shaggy Mane: Intrepid snaps the sticking Dart, and roars, And foams with bloody Mouth. No less, incens'd; Fierce Turnus storms:— Id. Æn. Lib. XII. Rain. See Flood. Out flies the South, with dropping Wings, and shrouds His dreadful Visage in a Night of Clouds. Jupiter Pluvius, or the Rainy, is represented in this Manner upon the Antonine Pillar at Rome. See Montfaucon's Antiquities, Vol. I. Plate ix.His white Hairs stream, his Beard is swell'd with Show'rs, Mists bind his Brows, Rain from his Bosom pours. As his broad Hand the hanging Clouds constrains, They roar, and scatter in descending Rains. Iris extends her Bow of various Dies, And feeds the weeping Clouds with new Supplies. The Corn is lodg'd: despairing mourns the Swain; And the long Labours of the Year are vain.— Sewell alt. Ovid. Met. Lib. I. —Black with rushing Rain A Tempest rag'd enormous, and the Hills And Fields with Thunder shook: o'er all the Sky A Show'r with Water dark, and thicken'd Winds Turbid descends.— Trap. Æn. Lib. V. As when a Tempest, thick with patt'ring Hail, Precipitate descends: from all the Fields Flies ev'ry Traveller, and lab'ring Hind, For Shelter safe, or to a River's Bank, Or to the hollow of some lofty Rock: There hide secure, while pour'd upon the Earth The Tempest rages: till the Sun restor'd Permits them to renew the Toils of Day.— Id. Æn. Lib. X. —As from the West And rainy Kids a turbid Storm descends, And beats the Ground: or thick with rattling Hail Tumbles precipitate into the Sea: When Jove tempestuous whirls the wintry Show'r With Winds aloft, and bursts the bellying Clouds.— Id. Æn. Lib. IX. Rapidity. As when from diff'rent Parts two rushing Fires Invade a Grove of crackling Lawrel-Boughs: Or from the Mountain's Tops with tumbling Flood And roaring Noise two foamy Rivers run Into the Sea, and sweeping force their Way: With such Rapidity the Trojan Chief And Turnus thro' the Battle rush.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. XII. As when a Rock, from some high Mountain's Top, Tumbles precipitate, or torn by Winds, Or by a roaring Flood, or eating Age: Down the steep Cliff the massy Fragment runs With Impulse vast, and jumps upon the Ground, Involving, as it rolls, Men, Beasts, and Woods.— Id. Ibid. More swift with rapid Course the Horses go, Than roaring Rivers in the Winter flow: With them compar'd the Jav'lin passes slow. The Parthian Dart not near so swiftly flies, Nor the South-Wind that sweeps along the Skies, Nor Thoughts that in an anxious Bosom rise.— Claud de Rapt. Lib. II. Reason. —Reason's Force can pierce The deep Recesses of the Universe: No Bars can stop it: thro' the World it flies, And Heav'n itself lies open to it's Eyes.— Creech. Manil. Lib. I. Think not thy Power too small, too weak thy Mind, Because it's to a little Body joyn'd: For wondrous is it's Force:—how small a Mass Of standard Gold exceeds vast Heaps of Brass! How little is the Apple of the Eye! And yet, at once, it takes in half the Sky: How vast the Disproportion to the Sense! The Organ small, the Object is immense. So, from the narrow Limits of the Heart, The active Soul does vig'rous Life impart To all the Limbs: it's Sway the Members own, And wide it's Empire spreads around it's Throne. Regard thy Powers, O Man! nor heed thy Size: In piercing Reason thy Advantage lies; Reason that conquers all, and rules the Skies.— Id. alt. Manil. Lib. IV. Repentance. The Raven discovered to Apollo that his Mistress Coronis was false to him; upon which Apollo killed her with an Arrow; but afterwards repenting, he lamented his dead Mistress, and in Revenge made the Raven's Feathers black, which were always white before. He heard her Falshood with a mournful Look, The Wreath his Head, the Harp his Hand forsook: Then kindling into Rage, his Bow he drew: Swift the inevitable Arrow flew, And deeply enter'd that soft tender Breast, Which to his own so often had been prest. A Groan she gave, when she the Mischief found, And pull'd the Arrow reeking from the Wound. O'er her fair Limbs the crimson Tide was shed, And with the streaming Blood her Spirits fled. The Lovesick God too late repents the Deed: He hates the Bird that made her Falsehood known, And hates himself for what himself had done: The Bow, the Shaft that sent her to the Fates, And his own Hand that sent the Shaft he hates: Fain would he heal the Wound, and ease her Pain, And tries the Compass of his Art in vain. But when he saw the lovely Nymph expire, The Pile made ready, and the kindling Fire, With Sighs, and Groans, her Obsequies he kept, And, if a God could weep, the God had wept: Her Corps he kiss'd, and heav'nly Incense brought, And solemniz'd the Death himself had wrought.— Addison alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. II. Unhappy Phaëton, when from the Sky, He saw the Earth, far, far below him, lie, All pale with fear, and trembling at the Sight, And scarce enduring such Excess of Light, Too late he wish'd the fiery Steeds untry'd, His Birth obscure, and his Request deny'd: Gladly would Merops for his Father own, And quit his boasted Kindred to the Sun.— Id. Ibid. Reproach. See Upbraiding. O void of all Resentment! whom no Wrongs Can move, Ye ever stupid Tuscans! whence This Panic? whence such Cowardice of Soul? A Woman drives You straggling, and defeats These Squadrons: Wherefore hold You in your Hands Those Swords, and those unprofitable Darts? But not to Venus, and nocturnal Wars Are You such Recreants: nor so listless watch The Bacchanalian Revels, when those Feasts The crooked Pipe of Bacchus has proclaim'd, (This is your Love, your Study, and Delight,) Till the auspicious Augur's Voice declares The sacred Rites begun, and Victims slain Invite You, with their Fat, and pamper'd Flesh, Into the deep Recesses of the Grove.— Trap. Æn. Lib. XI. O Thou, the Head, and Source of all this Woe To Latium! why so oft dost Thou expose Our wretched Citizens to Toil and Death? Forsooth, that Turnus may espouse a Queen, We, viler Lives, a Rabble, uninterr'd, And undeplor'd, must perish in the War.— Id. Ibid. Uxorious Man! ah! thoughtless! unconcern'd For thy own Kingdom, and thy own Affairs! What dost Thou purpose? with what Prospect waste Thy Time, unactive, on these Lybian Coasts? Id. Æn. Lib. IV. Request Dying. See Dying. Now at Death's Door, Procris she spent and fainting lay, And these few Words had only Strength to say: By all the sacred Bonds of plighted Love! By all your Rev'rence to the Pow'rs above! By all that made me charming once appear! By ev'ry Thing for which you held me dear! And last, by Love, the Cause thro' which I bleed, Let Aura never to my Bed succeed!— Tale. Ovid. Met. Lib. VII. Now strike, Polyxena sacrific'd to the Manes of Achilles. she said: now spill my noble Blood: Deep in my Breast, or Throat (for I'm prepar'd,) Your Dagger plunge:—and then her Breast she bar'd. But let not the rude Hand of Man pollute A Virgin Victim: 'tis a modest Suit. It best will please, whoe'er demands my Blood, That freely, and untouch'd I reach the Stygian Flood. Yet let one short, last, dying Pray'r be heard; To Priam's Daughter pay this last Regard: 'Tis Priam's Daughter, not a Captive, sues: Do not the Rites of Sepulture refuse. To my afflicted Mother, I implore, Free, without Ransom, my dead Corps restore: Nor barter me for Gain, when I am cold, But be her Tears the Price, if I am sold; Time was, she could have ransom'd me with Gold. Thus as she pray'd, one common Show'r of Tears Burst forth, and stream'd from ev'ry Eye but her's. Ev'n the Priest wept: and with a deep Remorse Plung'd in her Heart the Steel's resistless Force. Her slacken'd Limbs sink gently to the Ground, Dauntless her Looks, unalter'd by the Wound. And as she fell, she strove, with decent Pride, To hide what suits a Virgin's Care to hide.— Stanyan. Ovid. Met. Lib. XIII. —One thing Mezentius. I implore, (If aught of Grace remain for vanquish'd Foes) Permit my Corps to be interr'd: I know The Malice of my Subjects hovers round: Forbid that Outrage: let me share a Grave, Joyn'd to my Son, and rest with him in Death.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. X. — Turnus.He suppliant bends His Eyes: And, stretching out his Hand, 'Tis true, I have deserv'd, He cry'd: Nor will I strive To deprecate: Enjoy thy Fortune's Gift. Yet Oh! if aught a wretched Parent's Care Can touch thy Soul (Thou too hadst such a Sire The old Anchises) pity Daunus' Age: And, whether living, or despoil'd of Breath, (Thine be that Choice) restore me to my Friends.— Id. Æn. Lib. XII. Retirement. Oh! when shall I a Country Life enjoy, And with old Authors my calm Hours employ, Blest with sweet Leisure, blest with downy Peace, And my whole Business to consult my Ease! When, when shall I, compleatly happy, there, Delightfully forget my former Days of Care!— Hor. Lib. II. Sat. 6. What greater Bliss on Earth can be, Than after much Anxiety, Business the Load of Life laid down, Retiring to one's native Town, A quiet Leisure to possess, That long desir'd Happiness.— Catullus 31. Retreat. See Flight. Turnus, retreating, from the Fight withdraws By slow Degrees: and to that Part retires, Which by the ambient River's Stream is wash'd. The more the shouting Trojans urge him close, And thick'ning onwards rush. As when a Band Of Hunters press and gore with pointed Spears A savage Lion: He appal'd gives Way, With Aspect stern, and makes a sour Retreat: Courage and Rage permit him not to turn His Back: Nor does his Strength suffice to leap (Tho' fain he would) against the Darts, and Foes. So Turnus backward with slow Paces moves, Dubious of Thought, and all with Fury burns. Ev'n then the Centre of the hostile Troops He twice attack'd, twice drove them on the Walls Confus'd in hasty Flight. But all at once On Him alone their Forces from the Tents United press:—He therefore, with his Shield, And Arms, unable to support the Shock, Stands panting, with such Storms of Darts o'erwhelm'd On ev'ry Side: his hollow Temples round With oft repeated Blows his Helmet rings, Batter'd with Stones, and flatten'd to his Head: It's Crest struck off: Nor does his Target's Orb Suffice against the Strokes: The Trojans thick, With thund'ring Mnestheus at their Head, push on. Then Sweat in Rivers o'er his Body flows: He faints with Toil, stagg'ring he gasps for Breath: And the vast Labour shakes his weary Limbs. At length into the River's yellow Waves, Plunging himself, he leaps with all his Arms: The gentle Stream receives him, as he falls, In it's soft Lap: and, washing off the Blood, Wafts him exulting to rejoin his Friends.— Trap. Æn. Lib. IX. Revenge. Revenge is sweeter much than Life!—'tis true, So the unthinking say, and the mad Crew Of hect'ring Blades, who for slight Cause, or none, At ev'ry turn, are into Passion blown. Not so meek Thales, or Chrysippus taught, Or Socrates, who took the Poyson-Draught With a forgiving Soul, nor wish'd to see His base Accuser drink as deep as he. Much Satisfaction in Revenge to find, Denotes a little, mean, ungen'rous Mind: This, Observation will most plainly shew, For none so eagerly Revenge pursue, Or love it half so well as Women do.— Juv. Sat. XIII. In such tumultuous Haste her Passions sprung, They choak'd her Voice, and quite disarm'd her Tongue. No room for female Tears: the Furies rise, And ev'ry Thought of Right or Wrong despise: Reason's calm Dictates no Admittance find, Revenge alone commands her raging Mind.— Croxall alt. Ovid. Met. Lib. VI. Tears, unavailing, but defer our Time, The stabbing Sword must expiate the Crime: Or worse, if Wit on bloody Vengeance bent, A Weapon more tormenting can invent. O Sister! I 'ave prepar'd my stubborn Heart, To act some hellish and unheard-of Part: Some great, some mighty Mischief I've design'd, But yet the Draught's unfinisht in my Mind.— Id. Ibid. She stands attentive to his Perjuries, And darts avenging Horror from her Eyes. Raging Resentment fires her boiling Blood: She springs upon him 'midst the Captive Crowd, (Her Thirst of Vengeance want of Strength supplies,) She thrusts her forky Fingers in his Eyes: Tares out the rooted Balls: her Rage pursues, And in the hollow Orbs her Hands imbrews.— Stanyan. Ovid. Met. Lib. XIII. Revolution. See Golden Age Restor'd. The self-same Sun does ev'ry Morn appear, And as He drives a Day, He whirls a Year. From the same East He comes with equal Pace, To the same West He still directs his Race, And not one Change is seen in Nature's Face. The same Moon shines, and at a certain Day, Her Light encreases, and her Horns decay. Nature does still her beaten Track pursue, Nor like a Novice wanders in a new. Phœbus still warms those Signs where first he shone, And Day goes round with one eternal Sun: Thus prov'd:—because by just Degrees the Hours In different Countries are the same with our's. The Eastern Nations view the rising Fires, Whilst Night shades Us, and lazily retires. As to the distant West we nimbly run, That still removes, nor can we reach the Sun: His Race no East begins, no West doth bound, But on he drives in one continual Round.— Creech alt. Manil. Lib. I. When round the great Platonic Year has turn'd, In their old Ranks the wand'ring Stars shall stand, As when first marshal'd by th' Almighty's Hand.— Addison. Aus. Edyl. 18. Rewards. See Munificence. Then in the Center of the Cirque are plac'd The Prizes, sacred Tripods, Wreaths of Greens, And Palms for Victors: Arms, and purple Robes, Talents of massy Silver, and of Gold.— Trap. Æn. Lib. V. — On every Ship Three Heifers, to be chosen, he bestows, A silver Talent's massy Weight, and Wine, As Prizes.—To the Conq'ror first he gives A Cloak, with Gold embroider'd, edg'd with Fringe Of Melibœan Purple, doubly round Entwining.— Ibid. To him whose Merit held the second Place A Coat of Mail he gives, compact with Hooks, And wrought with triple Tissue: to defend At once and deck the Warrior.— Two brazen Cauldrons to the Third he gives, And silver Bowls with Figures rough emboss'd.— Id. Ibid. Not One of all this Number shall from me Go unrewarded: I'll on each bestow Two Gnossian Jav'lins, bright with polish'd Steel, And a carv'd Battle-Ax with Silver wrought. This Honour shall be one to All. The Three Who first excell, shall diff'rent Prizes share, And with pale Olive bind their Heads. The First A Steed enrich'd with Trappings shall receive: The Next an Amazonian Quiver, fill'd With Thracian Arrows, which a Belt around Incloses with broad Gold, a Buckle clasps With round smooth Diamonds: Be the Third content With this Argolick Shield.— Id. Ibid. —A huge Getulian Lion's Hide He gives to Salius, rough with heavy Fur, And golden Claws.— —Then He commands to bring A Shield, the Work of Didymaon's Art, Torn by the Grecians from the sacred Posts Of Neptune: and with that excelling Gift Distinguishes the well-deserving Youth.— Id. Ibid. He said: And for the Combat two Rewards Propos'd: The Victor's Prize, a Bull adorn'd With Gold, and Wreaths: a Sword, and burnish'd Helm, The Solace of the Vanquish'd.— Id. Ibid. Two Goblets I will give, in Silver wrought, And rough with Sculpture: which my Father took From sack'd Arisba: And two Talents Weight Of massy Gold: two Tripods: and a Bowl Of antique Cast, which Tyrian Dido gave. But if 'tis giv'n Us in the Chance of War To conquer Latium, and its Scepter wield, Victorious, and by Lot to share the Spoils: Saw'st Thou the Steed by Turnus press'd, the Arms In which he rode, all glitt'ring, all in Gold? That very Shield, and those red Plumes which grace His Helmet, from the Lot I will exempt, Already, Nisus, thy adjudg'd Reward. Besides, twelve choicest Dames, twelve captive Youths, With their own Arms, my Father shall bestow: And, added to them All, that Tract of Land, Which by the King Latinus is possess'd.— Id. Æn. Lib. IX. —Drawing from his Belt His gilded Sword, which wrought with wondrous Art Lycaon, born of Gnossian Race, had made, And in an iv'ry Scabbard fit inclos'd, That Present on the lovely Youth bestows.— Id. Ibid. Rites (Religious.) See Funerals. Manes. Palace. Procession. Sacrifice. They sprinkled first their Garments, and their Head, Then took the Way which to the Temple led: Before the Gradual, prostrate they ador'd, Kiss'd the cold Stone, and trembling thus implor'd.— Dryden alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. I. Be this a solemn Feast, the Priest had said, Be with each Mistress unemploy'd each Maid: With Skins of Beasts your tender Limbs inclose, And with an ivy Crown adorn your Brows: The leafy Thyrsus high in Triumph bear, And give your Locks to wanton in the Air. These Rites profan'd, the holy Seer fore show'd A mourning People, and a vengeful God.— Eusden. Ovid. Met. Lib. IV. — The holy Things Take you, my Father, and our Country-Gods: In me 'twere Guilt to touch them, just return'd Recent from so much Slaughter, and besmear'd With War: 'till in the living Stream I wash The Blood away.— Trap. Æn. Lib. II. He said, and paid the Gods their Honour due: A Bull to Neptune, and a Bull to Thee, Beauteous Apollo: To the stormy Pow'r A sable Ewe: a white one to the smooth Propitious Zephyrs.— Id. Æn. Lib. III. But when your Ships rest wafted o'er the Main, And you on Altars rais'd along the Shore Pay your vow'd Off'rings, with a purple Veil Cover your Head: lest any hostile Face Appearing, should disturb the solemn Rites, The holy Fires, and Honour of the Gods. This Form in sacrificing let your Friends With you observe; and let your future Race Pious in this Religion persevere.— Id. Ibid. —He to mighty Jove An hundred spatious Temples, in his Realms Of wide Extent, an hundred Altars built: And consecrated to the Gods the Hearths Of everlasting Fire: The Ground with Blood Of slaughter'd Victims smoking: and the Doors With various colour'd flow'ry Wreaths adorn'd.— Id. Æn. Lib. IV. He wakes the Embers, and the sleeping Fire, And with a holy Cake and Censer fill'd, The Trojan Lar, and aged Vesta's Shrine Suppliant adores.— Id. Æn. Lib. V. Now from your Bowls to Jove Libations pour: My Sire Anchises with religious Pray'rs Invoke: and on your Boards replace the Wine. This said, He binds his Temples with a Wreath Of verdant Boughs, and supplicant adores The Genius of the Place, and Earth the first Of Deities, the Nymphs, and River-Gods As yet unknown, and Night, and of the Night The rising starry Signs: in order next The Phrygian Mother, and Idæan Jove, And both his Parents, one rever'd in Heav'n, And one in Erebus.— Id. Æn. Lib. VII. Sleep leaves Æneas, and the Night retires. Rising, he turns him to the rising Sun, And, from the River, in his hollow Hands, By solemn Rite accustom'd, Water takes, And thus prefers his Suit in open Air. Ye Nymphs! Laurentian Nymphs! from whom the Birth Of Rivers springs: And Thou, supreme of Floods, O Father Tyber! with thy sacred Stream Receive Æneas, and relieve his Toils. Thou, who with Pity dost regard our Woes, In whate'er Soil thy beauteous Head is rais'd, Where-e'er thy Source: For ever shall by me Thy Deity be honour'd, horny God, King of Hesperian Rivers. Only grant To Us thy nearer Succour I implore.— Id. Æn. Lib. VIII. Æneas (tho' th' Interment of his Friends Hurries his Thoughts, with Fun'ral Cares perplex'd,) With the first Dawn of Morning, Victor pays His Vows to Heav'n.— Id. Æn. Lib. XI. River (passing over.) —To them the rapid Water's Course, First plung'd amidst the Flood the bolder Horse: With Strength oppos'd against the Stream they lead, While to the smoother Ford the Foot with Ease succeed.— Rowe. Lucan. Lb. I. —Spur on the winged Horse: And march the Foot, the Bridge, tho' falling, force. Make good your Passage, my brave Friends! he said: Swift as a Storm the nimble Horse obey'd: A-cross the Stream their deadly Darts they throw, And from their Station drive the yielding Foe. The Victors at their Ease the Ford explore, And pass the undefended River o'er.— Id. Lucan. Lib. II. Cæsar commands to Arms: Without delay The Soldier to the River bends his Way: None then with cautious Care the Bridge explor'd, Or sought the Shallows of the safer Ford: Arm'd at all Points, they plunge amidst the Flood, And with strong Sinews make the Passage good: Dangers they scorn'd that might the Bold affright, And stop ev'n panting. Cowards in their Flight. At length the farther Bank attaining safe, Chill'd by the Stream, their dropping Limbs they chafe: Then with fresh Vigour urge the Foes Pursuit, And in the sprightly Chace the Pow'rs of Life recruit.— Id. Lucan. Lib. IV. Rose. She in the Morning calls; Ye Maids! prepare, In rosy Garlands bind your flowing Hair: 'Tis Venus' Plant: The Blood fair Venus shed, O'er the gay Beauty pour'd immortal Red: From Love's soft Kiss a sweet Ambrosial Smell Was taught for ever on the Leaves to dwell: From Gems, from Flames, from orient Rays of Light, The richest Lustre makes it's Purple bright.— Parnel. Catull. Pervigil Veneris. Rout. See Battle. Slaughter. Their Queen thus slain, first flies Camilla's Wing Light-arm'd: the Rutuli confounded fly, And brave Atinas, and the scatter'd Chiefs, And broken Troops: To safer Posts they run, And spur their foaming Steeds to reach the Town. Nor now can any force in Arms sustain The Trojans, pressing, and dispensing Death: Or stand oppos'd: But languid back they bear Their Bows unbent, and o'er their Shoulders slung: And the swift Horses shake the putrid Soil With sounding Hoofs. A turbid Cloud of Dust Rolls to the City: On the lofty Tow'rs The Matrons stand, and to th' etherial Stars Raise female Cries: And frantick beat their Breasts. With Those who thro' the open Gates first croud Into the Town, a mingled Throng of Foes Together presses: Nor a cruel Death Do they escape: but ev'n within their Walls, Their Houses, and beneath their native Roofs, Transfix'd expire their Souls. Some shut the Gates: Nor durst permit their own imploring Friends To enter: Those with Arms the Passes guard, These rush against those Arms: Among them All, A Slaughter vast, and terrible, ensues. Others, before their weeping Parents Eyes, Excluded, by the Rout, and Ruin urg'd, Down the steep Trenches leap: With loosen'd Reins Some forward spur their Steeds, and blindly tilt Against the Gates, the Bars, and solid Posts.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. XI. The fiery Steeds, impatient of a Wound, Hurl their neglected Riders to the Ground: Or on their Friends with Rage ungovern'd turn, And trampling o'er the helpless Foot, are born. Hence foul Confusion and Dismay succeed, The Victors murder, and the Vanquish'd bleed: Their weary Hands the tir'd Destroyers ply, Scarce can these kill, so fast as those can die.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. VII. Sacrifice. See Funerals. Religious Rites. Soon as the Hills at Distance we behold Obscure in Mists, and Italy's low Plains, My Sire Anchises a large Goblet crowns, Fills it with Wine, and standing on the Deck Aloft, invokes the Gods.— Ye Gods! Controulers of the Land, the Seas, And Tempests: speed our Voyage by the Winds, And breathe propitious!— Trap. Æn. Lib. III. First to the Temple they repair, and seek Heav'n's Favour at the Altars: On them laid, Selected Victims, with accustom'd Rites, To Ceres Law-giver, and Phœbus, bleed, And Father Bacchus:—But above the rest To Juno, who presides o'er nuptial Beds. The beauteous Dido. Queen herself a Goblet holds In her Right Hand, and for Libation pours The Wine betwixt the Snow-white Heifer's Horns: Or round the smoking Altars slowly walks Before the Statues of the Gods: with Gifts Renews the Day: and on the open'd Breasts Of Victims, eagerly intent, consults Their breathing Entrails.— Id. Æn. Lib. IV. Now all the People nine whole Days had spent In Feasts: and Honour to the Altars paid: Three Calves to Eryx, to the Storms a Lamb He then commands to Sacrifice, and loose The Cables all in order from the Shore. Himself with Olive-Foliage shorn entwines His Head: and, standing on the distant Deck, A Goblet holds, and on the briny Deep Scatters the Entrails, pouring purest Wine.— Id. Æn. Lib. V. It chanc'd that on That Day, th' Arcadian King, Before the City, in a Grove's Recess, To great Alcides, and the Gods, perform'd A solemn Sacrifice: At which his Son Pallas assisted, and the chosen Youth, And wealthless Senate: Clouds of Incense rose, And at the Altars smok'd the tepid Blood. The chosen Youth, industrious, and the Priest Bring roasted Flesh of Bulls, distribute Bread In Baskets pil'd, and minister the Wine. Æneas, and, with him the Trojan Youth Feed on a solid Steer's perpetual Chine, And hallow'd Entrails for Lustration fry'd.— Id. Æn. Lib. VIII. He said: the double-colour'd Poplar veils His Temples with Herculean Shade, and hangs In twining Leaves: A consecrated Bowl Fills his left Hand: All, joyous, on the Board Pour their Libations, and invoke the Gods. Mean-while the Ev'ning to the Sky convex Rolls near: The Priests, Potitius at their Head, Bear lighted Torches: and, begirt with Skins Accustom'd, in Procession walk, restore The Banquets, bring the second grateful Chear, And with fill'd Chargers pile the sacred Hearths. The Salii next, with poplar Garlands wreath'd, To tuneful Measures round the Altars dance. A Youthful This, as That an aged Quire. These sing the Praises and the God-like Deeds Of Hercules.—Hail! undoubted Son of Jove! New Honour to the Gods! Be present here Propitious, and thy Sacrifice adorn.— Id. Æn. Lib. VIII. —In the Wood a Sow Of Milk-white Colour, with her Milk-white Young, Were found together on the verdant Shore. Them good Æneas to thy Altar brings, Great Queen of Gods, a Sacrifice to Thee.— Id. Ibid. The Feast approach'd, when to the blew-ey'd Maid, His Vows, for Cygnus slain, Achilles paid, And a white Heifer on her Altar laid. The reeking Entrails on the Fire they threw, And to the Gods the grateful Odour flew: Heav'n had it's Part in Sacrifice: The rest Was broil'd, and roasted, for the future Feast. The chief invited Guests were plac'd around; And Hunger first asswag'd, the Bowls were crown'd, Which in deep Draughts their Cares and Labours drown'd.— Dryden. Ovid. Met. Lib. XII. Affection giving way to public Good, No more the Parent now the King withstood; The weeping Priests fair Iphigenia lead, At the high Altar's Side prepar'd to bleed. All mourn her Fate: but no Relief appear'd: The Royal Victim bound, the Knife was rear'd: When that Diana. offended Pow'r, who caus'd their Woe, Relenting ceas'd her Wrath, and stopp'd the coming Blow: A Mist before the Ministers she cast, And, in the Virgin's Room a This Account of Iphigenia seems a Mixture of two Scripture Stories Abraham's Sacrifice of his Son, Gen. Chap. xxii. and Jephtha's Vow Judges, Chap. xi.—It is worth observing, that many Passages among the Greek and Roman Poets bear a very near Resemblance to what we find in the Jewish Books, and probably were taken thence, and fashioned by the Borrowers according to the Opinions of their own Times, and apply'd to their own Gods and Heroes. The Story of Baucis and Philemon, Vol. I. pag. 499 is another Instance of this Sort, and seems two other Scripture Stories blended and disguised; as most People will judge, upon comparing it with Abraham and Sarah's Entertainment of three Angels, Gen. Chap. xviii. and Lot's Reception of two Angels, by whom he was preserved from the Destruction of wicked Sodom, Gen. Chap. xix. Hind she plac'd. Th' Oblation slain, and Phœbe reconcil'd, The Storm was hush'd, and roaring Ocean smil'd: A prosp'rous Gale the thousand Vessels bore, Which, long distress'd, now gain the Phrygian Shore.— Dryd. alt. Ovid. Met. Lib. XII. Sacrifice to the Infernal Powers. Four Bullocks first, with Hides of sable Hue, The Priestess here before the Altars plac'd: And full upon their Foreheads downwards pour'd The Wine: Then plucking from between their Horns Their foremost Hairs, into the holy Fire The first Oblation flings: invoking loud Great Hecatè, potent in Hell, and Heav'n. Some, sticking Knives beneath, in Bowls receive The tepid Blood: Æneas with his Sword Himself dispatches to th' infernal Pow'rs, The Mother of the Furies, and to Earth Her Sister Deity, a black Ewe Lamb, And, Proserpine, a barren Cow to Thee. Then, to the Stygian Monarch he begins The nightly Sacrifice: the solid Flesh Of Bulls upon the flaming Altar lays, And o'er their burning Entrails pours the Oil.— Trap. Æn. Lib. VI. Sailing. See Navigation. Pilot. Storm at Sea. —He gives command with speed To raise the Masts, with Yards to stretch the Sails: At once they tug the Haulsers all: at once The left Side now unfurl, and now the right: Now this, now that way, tack at once: The Fleet With it's own Breezes smoothly plows the Waves. Before them all, first Palinurus leads Th' embody'd Line: The rest commanded steer Their Course to him.— Trap. Æn. Lib. V. —Then all at once The Trojans urge their Toil, and from the Dock Draw their tall Ships: the new-pitch'd Gallies float.— Id. Æn. Lib. IV. —From all Parts, thou seest, Rushing they croud the Shore; Their Sails unfurl'd Invite the Breezes, and with joyful Haste The shouting Mariners have crown'd their Ships.— Id. Ibid. —Good Æneas then, Soon as the Deep lay smooth, with Canvas spread Unmoors, and leaves the Port. A Breeze at Night Springs fresh: Nor does the silver Moon deny Her Beams, which tremble on the glim'ring Waves.— Id. Æn. Lib. VII. Neptune with Winds propitious swell'd their Sails, And sped them safe beyond the boiling Tides.— Id. Ibid. —All at once the Winds Lay hush'd, and ev'ry Blast: the lab'ring Oars Cleave the smooth Marble of the yielding Deep.— Id. Ibid. He spoke, and spread His Canvas to the Wind, Unmoor'd his Boat, and left the Shore behind. Swift flew the nimble Keel: and as they past, Long Trails of Light the shooting Meteors cast: Ev'n the fixt Stars above in Motion seem, Shake thro' the Blast, and dart a quiv'ring Beam. Black Horrors on the gloomy Ocean brood, And in long Ridges rolls the threatning Flood: While loud and louder murm'ring Winds arise, And growl from ev'ry Quarter of the Skies. When thus the trembling Master, pale with Fear, Behold what Wrath the dreadful Gods prepare! My Art is at a Loss: the various Tide Beats my unstable Bark on ev'ry Side: From the Nor-West the setting Current swells, While Southern Storms the driving Rack foretells. Our only means of Safety is to yield, And measure back with Haste the foamy Field: To reach, while yet we may, the neighb'ring Shore, And give our unavailing Labour o'er.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. V. Satyr. Sharp as a Sword, Lucilius drew his Pen, And struck, with pannic Terror, guilty Men: At his just Strokes the hardned Wretch would start, Feel the cold Sweat, and tremble at the Heart.— Anon. alt Juv. Sat. I. —With conceal'd Design Did crafty Horace his low Numbers join: And, with a sly insinuating Grace, Laugh'd at his Friend, and look'd him in the Face: Would raise a Blush, where secret Vice he found, And tickle, whilst he gently prob'd the Wound. With seeming Innocence the Crowd beguil'd: But made the desp'rate Passes when he smil'd.— Dryd. Pers. Sat. I. Scylla and Charybdis. Far off we hear the Sea with dreadful Roar Break on the Rocks, and dash upon the Shore. The foamy Waves boil high on ev'ry Side, And scoop the Sands, and blacken all the Tide. Charybdis' Gulf, my Father cries, behold! And those the Rocks which Helenus foretold: Ply, ply your Oars, my Friends, and bear away: Swift as the Word, the Mariners obey. First skillful Palinure: then all the Train Steer to the left, and plow the liquid Main. Now on a tow'ring Arch of Waves we rise, Heav'd on the bounding Billows to the Skies; Then as the roaring Surge retreating fell, We shoot down headlong to the Depths of Hell. Thrice the rough Rocks rebellow in our Ears, Thrice mount we on the Waves, and see the dewy Stars.— Pitt alt. Virg. Æn. Lib. II. On the right Hand roars Scylla, on the Left Implacable Charybdis, which, with Gulf Voracious, thrice sucks in the broken Tides; Then spouts them high, disgorg'd, into the Air, Alternate, and with Billows beats the Stars. But Scylla, with dark Caverns round inclos'd, Uprears her Head, and draws among her Rocks The Vessels: Human is her upper Part, A Virgin's beauteous Face, and beauteous Breast; Her nether Shape a monstrous Pristis joyn'd To Tails of Dolphins, and the Wombs of Wolves.— Trap. Ibid. Here cruel Scylla guards the rocky Shore, And there the Waves of loud Charybdis roar: This sucks, and vomits Ships, and Bodies drown'd, And rav'nous Dogs the Womb of That surround: In Face a Virgin: and (if ought be true By Bards recorded) once a Virgin too.— Catcott. Ovid. Met. Lib. XIII. Sea. See Storm at Sea. As when the Ocean whitens with the Foam, And from a-far rolls wavy to the Shore, Roaring with dreadful Noise among the Rocks, And riding, ridgy, of a Mountain's Height; The lowest Deep with circling Eddy boils, And to the Surface hurls the sable Sand.— Trap. Virg. Geor. Lib. III. Sea-Fight. All rush at once: And all the Ocean foams Convuls'd with dashing Oars, and trident Beaks. They hoise to Sea: The Cyclades up-torn You would have thought were floating on the Deep: Or lofty Hills encount'ring Hills: So huge The tow'ring Vessels, rigg'd and mann'd for War. Fire-Balls of Tow, and missile Jav'lins fly: And recent Gore discolours Neptune's Fields.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. VIII. Now, Prow to Prow, advance each hostile Fleet, And want but one concurring Stroke to meet: Now Peals of Shouts, and mingling Clamours roar, And drown the brazen Trump, and plunging Oar. The brushing Pine the frothy Surface plies, While on the Banks their lusty Rowers rise; Each brings the Stroke back on his ample Chest, Then firm upon his Seat he lights represt. With clashing Beaks the launching Vessels meet, And from the mutual Shock alike retreat. Thick Clouds of flying Shafts the Welkin hide, Then fall, and floating strow the Ocean wide. At length the stretching Wings their Order leave, And in the Line the mingling Foe receive. Some lie, by Chains and Grapplings strong compell'd, Whilst Others by the tangling Oars are held: The Seas are hid beneath the closing War, Nor need they cast the Jav'lin now from far: With hardy Strokes the Combatants engage, And with keen Faulchions deal their deadly Rage. Man against Man, and Board by Board they lie, And on those Decks their Arms defended, die. The rolling Surge is stain'd around with Blood, And foamy Purple swells the rising Flood.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. III. Seasons. See Autumn. Spring. Winter. Year. There stood gay Spring, fair Flow'rs her Brows surround, There Summer, naked, and with Wheat-Ears crown'd. With trodden Grapes, there Autumn stood besmear'd; And icy Winter, with his hoary Beard.— Ov. Met. II. In every Season Pleasures may be found; Autumn with Fruit, with Harvest Summer's crown'd: The Spring's adorn'd with Flow'rs to charm the Eye, And Winter Fires the absent Sun supply.— Tate. Ovid. Rem. Am. First comes the Spring, and Venus ever gay, And flutt'ring Zephyrus that prepares her Way: Flora, before them, with a lib'ral Hand, Indulgent, strows her Blessings o'er the Land: Now various Flow'rs enrich'd with Brilliant Dyes, Now fragrant Odours ev'ry where arise. Heat, next, and dusty Harvest come in Place, And Summer Breezes fan the Sun-burnt Face. Then Autumn comes, repleat with sparkling Wine: All Hail, Great Bacchus, glorious and divine! Unsettled then, and changeable the Skies, And all uncertain are the Winds that rise. From East and South the roaring Tempest springs, And with loud Thunder flashing Lightning brings. Cold then, benumbing, comes, severely blows The piercing North, and scatters Frosts and Snows. Winter succeeds, decrepid, wrinkled, old, Chatter his Teeth, his Limbs all shake with Cold.— Lucret. Lib. V. Spring's genial Warmth the Winter Cold succeeds; Then Summer comes, and parches up the Meads; Close follows fruitful Autumn, crown'd with Grain; And shiv'ring Winter soon returns again.— Hor. Lib. IV. Od. 7. Secrets. O Corydon, art Thou so dull to think, A Great Man's Vices e'er can be conceal'd? Suppose his Servants hush; yet ev'n his Beasts, His Dog, his Columns, and his Walls will tell. Bar fast the Windows, ev'ry Crevice stop, Shut the Doors close, and take the Lights away: Be Silence all around, no Mortal near: Yet whate'er Crime at Midnight he commits, His Butler knows before the rising Day: And quickly shall he hear his Steward and Cook, With snarling Scoffs, enlarging on the Tale. For Servants never scruple to revenge Their Master's angry Words, or hasty Blows, By charging on them ev'ry Crime they can. Nor shalt Thou fail to find upon the Road, Some drunken Rogue to plague thee with his Jokes, And din thy Faults, and Follies, in thy Ears. A virtuous Life on all Accounts is best, And amongst Others, that Thou may'st despise The Tongues of Servants: for the greatest Harm Those Rascals can commit, is with their Tongues. Yet more a Wretch than they, is that poor Slave, Who stands in Awe of those he feeds and pays.— Juv. Sat. IX. Yes, trust me, ev'ry Mouth of human Mold, Can Fire, much sooner than a Secret hold: For whatsoe'er in Whispers you confide, Strait flies abroad, exulting, far and wide. While such Additions the proud Wonder swell, As burthen even Fame herself to tell.— Addison junr. Petron. Arb. Serpent. Snake. Fresh from his Den, the Winter slept away, Shoots forth the burnish'd Snake in open Day: Who, fed with ev'ry Poison of the Plain, Sheds his old Spoils, and shines in Youth again; Proud of his golden Scales rolls tow'ring on, And darts his forky Tongue, and glitters in the Sun.— Pitt. Virg. Æn. Lib. II. Lo, horrid to relate! two Serpents glide, And roll incumbent on the glassy Tide, Advancing to the Shore: their Spires they raise Fold above Fold, in many a tow'ring Maze. Beneath their burnish'd Breasts the Waters glow, Their crimson Crests inflame the Deeps below: O'er the vast Flood, extended long and wide, Their curling Backs lay floating on the Tide: Lash'd to a Foam the boiling Billows roar, And soon the dreadful Monsters reach'd the Shore: Their hissing Tongues they darted as they came, And their red Eye-Balls shot a sanguine Flame.— Id. Ibid. —From the Bottom of the Shrine A slipp'ry Serpent, vast, sev'n Volumes roll'd, Sev'n Spires: he gently twines around the Tomb And o'er the Altar glides: Cerulean Streaks, And burnish'd Spots, distinct with Drops of Gold, Brighten'd his Back, and glitt'ring Scales: As when From th' adverse Sun the show'ry Bow reflects A thousand various Colours in the Clouds.— Trap. Æn. Lib. V. A Serpent too of more distinguish'd Note Lurks in Calabria's Woods: his Breast erect: His scaly Back convolv'd: his Belly long, And speckl'd with large Spots.—While Rivers burst From Fountains, while in dewy Spring the Earth Is moisten'd by the rainy Southern Winds, He lives in Water: and, the Nooks of Banks Inhabiting, on Fish, and croaking Frogs, Voracious, feeds: and crams his filthy Maw. But when the Ponds are dry'd, and Summer cleaves The Soil adust, He darts into the Fields, Raging, and rolling round his fiery Eyes, Scar'd by the Heat, exasp'rated with Thirst. Ah! may I never then in open Air Sweet Sleep indulge, nor lie upon the Grass In a cool Glade; when having cast his Skin, And new, and sleek in glitt'ring Youth, he rolls: Or, leaving in his Den his Eggs, or young, Sublime against the Sun, his burnish'd Crest Uprears, and darts his quiv'ring forky Tongue.— Id. Virg. Georg. Lib. III. Deep in this dreary Den, conceal'd from Day, Sacred to Mars, a mighty Serpent lay: Bloated with Poyson to a monstrous Size, Fire broke in Flashes when he glanc'd his Eyes: His tow'ring Crest was glorious to behold, Erect it stood, and shone like beaten Gold. Three Tongues he brandish'd when he charg'd his Foes, His Teeth stood threat'ning in three dreadful Rows. Soon as this Den th' unlucky Tyrians found, And in the Spring, their plunging Pitchers sound, Rows'd by the Noise, the Serpent 'gan to rear His blew-green Head, and Hissings fill'd the Air. The Tyrians drop'd their Vessels in the Fright, All pale and shudd'ring at the hideous Sight. Spire above Spire, uprear'd in Air, he stood, And gazing round him, overlook'd the Wood: Then floating on the Ground, in Circles roll'd, He rush'd along in many a winding Fold. Of such a Length, and such a monstrous Size, The Serpent in the polar Circle lies, That stretches over half the Northern Skies. In vain the Tyrians on their Arms rely, In vain attempt to fight, in vain to fly: All their Endeavours and their Hopes are vain! Some die entangl'd in the winding Train: Some he devours, and some his pois'nous Breath, And mortal Venom doom to sudden Death. And now his Rage increasing with his Pain, Enlarg'd his Throat with ev'ry swelling Vein; With Scales erect he furrows up the Ground, Which from each Motion gives a rushing Sound. Churn'd in his Teeth the foamy Venom rose, And from his Mouth a Blast of Vapours flows, Such as th' infernal Stygian Waters cast: The Air around was poison'd with the Blast. Now, in a Maze of Rings he lies enroll'd, Now, all unravell'd, and without a Fold: Now, like a Torrent, with a mighty Force, Bears down the Forest in his boist'rous Course.— Addison alt. Ovid. Met. Lib. III. Severity. With jealous Madness fir'd, she flies in haste, And tells the King, his Daughter was unchaste. The Orchamus, King of Persia, being informed of his Daughter Leucothoe's Amour with Phœbus, caused her to be interred alive. King, incens'd to hear his Honour stain'd, No more the Father, nor the Man retain'd. In vain she stretch'd her Arms, and turn'd her Eyes To her lov'd God, Enlightner of the Skies: In vain she own'd it was a Crime, yet still It was a Crime not acted by her Will. The brutal Sire stood deaf to ev'ry Pray'r, And, deep in Earth, intomb'd alive the Fair.— Eusden. Ovid. Met. Lib. IV. And now appear'd the From Æolus to his Daughter Canace who had committed Incest with her own Brother. Messenger of Death, Sad were his Looks, and scarce he drew his Breath, To say, Your Father sends you—(With that Word His trembling Hands presented me a Sword:) Your Father sends You this, and let's You know That Your own Crimes the Use of it will show.— Dryden. Ovid. Epist. XI. Shame. See Blushing. She threw her Body prostrate on the Bed, And to conceal her Blushes hid her Head: Oh go! or question me no more, she said, But spare the Blushes of a wretched Maid.— Again she rais'd her Head: but soon oppress'd With Shame, reclin'd it on her Nurse's Breast: Bath'd it with Tears, and strove to have confess'd. Twice she began, and stopp'd: again she try'd: The falt'ring Tongue its Office still deny'd: At last her Veil before her Face she spread.— Dryden alt. Ovid. Met. Lib. X. Sheep. First, I direct, that in warm Huts the Sheep Be fodder'd till the leafy Spring returns: And that the frosty Ground with Fern, or Straw, Be litter'd underneath them: Lest the Ice Should hurt the tender Cattle, and induce The foul contagious Scab, or cramp their Limbs. But when gay Spring returns, and Zephyrs breathe Inviting: To the Lawns and Pastures send Both Goats and Sheep: When Venus first appears, On the cool Herbage let them feed: while fresh The Morning rises, while the Meads are grey, And most the Cattle on the tender Grass Enjoy the Dew.— If Wool be thy Delight, from prickly Brakes, And Burs, and Thistles, be thy Flocks remov'd: Rich Pastures shun: soft, Snow-white Fleeces chuse. The Ram, tho' white himself, if underneath His humid Palate ev'n his Tongue be black, Discard, (lest He with sable Spots infect The new-born Lambs, discolouring the Race,) And seek another o'er the well-stock'd Field.— Id. —The foul contagious Scab Seizes the Sheep, when far into their Flesh The Cold of Rain, or Winter's hoary Frost Has sunk: Or to their new-shorn Sides the Sweat Adheres, unwash'd away: Or prickly Briers Their Bodies wound.— Whatever Sheep thou feest to Shades retire More frequent; or more negligently chew The topmost Grass: or loiter in the Rear: Or, feeding, on the Field lie down: or late, And lonely, with the Close of Eve, return: Delay not, kill th' Infected: e'er thro' all Th' unwary Flock the dire Contagion spread.— Trap. Virg. Georg. Lib. III. Ship-Race. Four Ships selected out from all the Fleet, Equal, begin the Strife with pond'rous Oars. His swiftly sailing Pristis Mnestheus plies With sturdy Rowers.—In the huge Chimera, A City's Work, rides Gygas: Her impel The youthful Trojans with a triple Tire: Three Banks of Oars above each other rise. Sergestus in the mighty Centaur sails: And Scylla of cerulean Colour bears Cloanthus—. There stood a Rock at Distance in the Main: Here Prince Æneas from a leafy Oak, To guide the Sailors plants a verdant Goal: From whence they should return, and round direct In long Circumference their winding Course. Then All by Lot their Places take: and first, The Chiefs in Gold and Crimson stand, from far Effulgent on the Decks: The other Youth With poplar Wreaths are shaded: smear'd with Oil Their naked Shoulders shine: upon their Seats With strong brac'd Arms intent they grasp their Oars, Intent expect the Signal: Throbbing Fear Beats in their Breasts, and anxious Love of Praise. Soon as the Trumpet loudly sounds, at once All from their Barriers spring: The Shouts confus'd Of Sailors rend the Vault of Heav'n: The Sea Turn'd upward froths beneath their dashing Arms: At once they plow the Brine: and all the Deep Yawns wide, convuls'd with Oars, and trident Beaks. Then with the Party-Favour of the Crowd, With Shouts and mix'd Applauses all the Grove Resounds: The Shores included roll the Noise: And from the echoing Hills the Voice returns. Amidst the Throng and Hurry on the Waves, Before the rest, first Gyas scuds away: Him next Cloanthus follows, with his Oars More happy: but his Vessel by it's Weight Detains him tardy: After These, with Sails Equal, the Pristis, and the Centaur strive To run the foremost: Now the Pristis gains, Now the huge Centaur wins on Her: Now Both Together with united Fronts are born: And the long Gallies plow the briny Deep. They now approach'd the Rock, and reach'd the Goal, When Gyas first, and Victor, in mid-Sea Calls to Menætes Pilot of his Ship: Whither so far decline You to the Right? Hither direct your Steerage, love the Shore, And let our Rowers raze the left-hand Rocks: Leave Others to the Deep.—He said: but old Menætes, fearing hidden Shelves, detorts His Rudder to the Ocean:—Why so far Diverse, Menætes? Nearer to the Shore, Gyas again calls out aloud, and sees Cloanthus close and pressing on his Stern. He, betwixt Gyas, and the sounding Rocks, Interior, skims the left-hand Way, and swift Outstrips his Rival, and beyond the Goal Smooth shoots along, and gains the safer Seas. The Youth with Rage and Disappointment fir'd, (Tears running down his Cheeks) his Dignity Forgetting, and the Safety of his Friends, Push'd slow Menætes from the high-built Deck Precipitate into the Sea: Himself As Pilot takes his Place, exhorting loud His Crew, and turns the Rudder to the Shore. This unexpected Change with eager Hope Fires Mnestheus, and Sergestus, lagging last, To vanquish Gyas thus retarded.—First Sergestus takes his Place, and to the Rock Approaches: yet not all his Vessel first, Part first, the Rival Pristis presses part Close with her Beak. Then Mnestheus, thro' the Crew Walking along the middle of his Deck, Excites his Mates.—And now, with utmost Force They tug their Oars: With vast repeated Strokes The beaky Vessel trembles, and the Sea Flies back: The panting Labour shakes their Limbs, And clammy Mouths: Sweat flows in Rivers round. Fortune to These the wish'd-for Honour gave: For while Sergestus, furious in the Strife, And heedless, urg'd his Foredeck to the Shelves, Interior, and within a narrow Space Of Sea confin'd: amidst the jutting Rocks He stuck, unfortunate: The Rocks rebound: Among their craggy Points the stubborn Oars Stand cracking, bent: The Foredeck shatter'd hangs: The Crew of Sailors rise, and clamour loud, Detain'd, embarass'd: Iron Spikes and Poles Of sharpen'd Oak they ply: and on the Gulf, Industrious, gather up the broken Oars. But Mnestheus joyful, and with that Success Itself more vig'rous, with his rowing Crowd, And all the Winds invited to his Sails, Gains the prone Deep, and swiftly shoots away Upon the open Ocean.—First He leaves Sergestus struggling with the lofty Rock, Pent up among the narrow Shelves, in vain Calling for Help, and learning how to run With broken Oars. Then Gyas, and the huge Chimæra's Bulk he follows: She, because She lost her Pilot, yields. Cloanthus now Alone remains, just entring in the Port: Him he pursues, and with his utmost Strength Close urges. Now the Noise redoubles: All With Shouts encourage him: The Sky resounds With deaf'ning Clamour. These disdain to lose Th' Advantage they have gain'd, and burn to stake Their Lives for Glory: Those Success inspires: They can, because 'tis thought they can: And Both Perhaps had born the Prize with equal Keels, Had not Cloanthus, stretching to the Sea His Hands, Thus vow'd, and Thus invok'd the Gods. Ye Gods! who rule the Ocean which I sail! Victor before your Altars, on This Shore, To You a Snow-white Bull I will present, Oblig'd by Vow; and on the briny Deep Scatter the Entrails, pouring purest Wine. He said: And him beneath the lowest Waves The whole Assembly of the Nereids heard, And Phorcus, and the Virgin Panopea; And old Portunus with his ample Palm Himself push'd on the Vessel: She more swift Than Wind, or feather'd Arrow, flies to Land, Within the Harbour's deep Recess secure.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. V. Shout. See Battle. Now all the ready Legions vow to join Their Chief belov'd, in ev'ry bold Design: All lift their well-approving Hands on high, And rend with Peals of loud Applause the Sky. Such is the Sound, when Thracian Boreas spreads His weighty Wings o'er Ossa's piny Heads: At once the noisy Groves are all inclin'd, And, bending, roar beneath the sweeping Wind: At once their rattling Branches All they rear, And drive the leafy Clamour thro' the Air.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. I. As when the Winds, against the rocky Shore The Billows drive, or make the Forests roar: So loud the Shout, when rich and strangely drest The Player comes, they clap his gawdy Vest. Well, hath the Actor spoken? Not a Line: Why then d'ye clap? Oh, Sir, his Cloths are fine.— Creech alt. Æn. Lib II. A Shout ascending beats the golden Stars, Immense.— Trap. Sibyl. See Oracle. You'll see the Sibyl in her rocky Cave, And hear the furious Maid divinely rave. The dark Decrees of Fate the Virgin sings, And writes on Leaves, Names, Characters, and Things. The mystic Numbers in the Cavern laid, Are rang'd in order by the sacred Maid: There they repose in Ranks along the Floor: At length a casual Wind unfolds the Door: The casual Wind disorders the Decrees, And the loose Fates are scatter'd by the Breeze. She scorns to range them, and again unite The fleeting Scrolls, or stop their airy Flight. Then back retreat the disappointed Train, And curse the Sibyl they consult in vain. But Thou, more wise, thy purpos'd Course delay, Tho' thy rash Friends should summon Thee away: And wait with Patience, tho' the flatt'ring Gales Sing in thy Shrowds, and fill thy op'ning Sails. With suppliant Pray'rs intreat her to relate, In vocal Accents all thy various Fate.— Pitt. Æn. Lib. III. But good Æneas to the tow'ring Fane Repairs, o'er which Apollo high presides: And to the spacious Cavern, where retir'd The venerable Sibyl dwells: to whom Prophetick Delius an extensive Soul And Mind inspires, and future Things reveals.— Trap. —Cut deep in the Eubœan Rock A Roomy Cave descended: whither lead An hundred Entrances of wide Extent, An hundred Mouths: whence rush as many Sounds, The Sibyl's Oracles. And now they reach'd The Portal: When the Virgin, 'Tis the Time Now to enquire the Doom of Fate: Behold, The God, the God, she cry'd.—While thus she spoke, Before the Doors, her Looks, her Colour chang'd, Sudden: Her Hair in wild Confusion rose: Enthusiastic Fury heav'd her Breast, And throbbing Heart: More large her Form appear'd: Nor spoke she mortal Accents: when inspir'd By the more present God. Dost thou delay, Trojan Æneas, thy Requests, and Vows? Dost thou delay? She cry'd: For not till then The trembling Fane will open wide it's Mouths. This said, she silent stood: A chilling Fear Ran thro' the hardy Trojan's Bones.— —Impatient in her Grot Apollo's swelling Priestest wildly raves: Reluctant, lab'ring from her Breast to heave Th' incumbent God: So much the more he curbs Her foamy Mouth, subdues her madding Heart, And pressing forms her. Now spontaneous fly Wide ope the Cavern's hundred spacious Mouths, And waft her Oracles into the Air.— Trap. Æn. Lib. VI. The Sibyl backward turns her aweful Eyes: And, I no Goddess am, with Sighs replies: Your Incense spare, and Attributes of Praise, Nor to the Rank of Gods a mortal raise. Yet know, that I like Gods had never dy'd, Would I with Phœbus' Passion have comply'd: Who, while he woo'd me to his scorn'd Embrace, And offer'd high to tempt me to Disgrace, Ask what Thou wilt, Cumæan Fair, said He: Thou shalt enjoy thy Wish, whate'er it be. I snatch'd a Heap of Sand, and wish'd to bear, For ev'ry numb'red Grain I grasp'd, a Year. Forgetful that I was, to wish not too, That I my Youth might ev'ry Year renew! Perpetual Youth, and still unfading Charms, The God had giv'n, would I have fill'd his Arms. His Gifts despis'd, a single Life I led, Nor deign'd the God the Honour of my Bed. But now those happy blooming Days are gone, And crazy Age with trembling Steps comes on: Sev'n Ages have I liv'd: and live I must, Till I in Years can score those Grains of Dust. Three hundred circling Springs, and Autumns still Remain behind, the vast Amount to fill. The Time shall come, when Age and long Decay Will shrink the Substance of this mould'ring Clay: Then none shall think I e'er had Charms to fire A God, or be an Object of Desire. Such Change shall I endure, he will not know, Or will deny that once he lov'd me so. No Eye shall see me: yet a Voice alone, The Fates will grant, by which I shall be known.— Pope. Ovid. Met. Lib. XIV. Siege. Assault. See City Taken. Turnus. He, turbulent in Ire, surveys the Walls This Way, and That, and on his lofty Steed The Passes inaccessible explores. Doubtful which Post to try, and how to draw The Trojans from their Trenches to the Field. All this the Trojans, from their lofty Mounds Trembling beheld, and man their Works in Arms: With anxious Fear the guarded Gates explore, And join the Battlements with Bridges laid. Turnus excites the Soldiery to Arms, Himself in Arms: All marshall for the Fight Their brazen Squadrons: and with various Talk Exasperated, whet each other's Rage. The hardy Trojans on the left Hand Walls (A River guards the Right,) oppose their War: Within their roomy Trenches range their Line, And, anxious, on the high-built Turrets stand. Strait the loud Trumpet's Brass with dire Alarm Sounds shrill from far; a thund'ring Shout succeeds: And Heav'n's high Vault rebellows to the Noise. The Volscians, by a Canopy of Shields Protected, forwards rush, prepare to fill The Trenches, and to level with the Plain The Bulwarks rais'd. Some, viewing round, explore The Passes: and attempt to scale the Walls, Where by thin Ranks less guarded they appear. The Trojans opposite, by lasting Siege Long since experienc'd in defensive War, Pour ev'ry kind of Weapons: push them back With spiky Poles, and tumble from above Vast rocky Fragments of pernicious Weight: If possible to break the Roof of Shields Which hides the Troop: Yet They all Dangers chuse Beneath their iron Tortoise to sustain. Not long: for where the thickest Globe of Foes Crouds to the Walls, the Trojans from their Works Roll down a Millstone of prodigious Size: Which crush'd the Rutuli, and far and wide Burst thro' the Cov'ring which their Armour form'd. A Tow'r there stood, commodious and aloft With Bridges rais'd, which all th' Italians strove With utmost Force and Efforts to o'erturn: To them oppos'd the Trojans pour a Storm Of Stones, and thro' the Loop-holes shoot their Darts. First Turnus, in the Van, a Firebrand threw, And fix'd the flaming Mischief to it's Side: Which, rising with the Wind, the Timber seiz'd, And, sticking to the Lintels, eat it's Way. Confus'd within They tremble, and in vain Attempt to fly the Ruin.—While they throng Huddled in Heaps, and to that Part retire, Which from the Pest is free: Down sudden falls The Tow'r: and Heav'n all thunders with the Noise. A Shout thro' all the Works and Ramparts ran: Eager they bend their Bows, and whirl their Slings: The Ground all stuck with Darts, the hollow Casks And Targets in the Shock of Conflict ring: The Combat thickens, like a Storm that flies From Westward, when the show'ry Kids arise.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. IX. —They all in Emulation strive, And form a Wedge, and rushing storm the Walls. Ladders at once, and sudden Fire appears. Some to the Gates advance, and kill the first Who obvious stand: some hurl the missive Steel In Storms of Shafts, and darken all the Sky.— Id. Virg. Æn. Lib. XII. Among the trembling Citizens within Wild Discord reigns: some press to ope the Gates Wide to the Trojans, and the King himself Drag to the Walls: some resolute in Arms Sustain the Combat, and defend the Town.— Id. Ibid. Siege of Massilia by C. Trebonius Lieutenant to Cæsar.On rolling Wheels they raise a lofty Tow'r, Whence on the Walls a Storm of Darts they pour. Nor with less active Rage the Grecians burn: But larger Ruin on their Foes return. Nor Hands alone the missile Deaths supply, From strong-spring'd Cross-Bows whistling Arrows fly: The steely Corslet and the Bones they break, Thro' Multitudes their fatal Journeys take, Nor wait the ling'ring Parcœ's slow Delay, But wound, and to new Slaughter wing their Way. Now, by some vast Machine, a pond'rous Stone, Pernicious, from the hostile Wall is thrown: At once, on many, swift the Shock descends, And the crush'd Carcasses confounding blends. So rolls some falling Rock by Age long worn, Loose from it's Root by raging Whirlwinds torn, And, thund'ring down the Precipice is born: O'er crashing Woods the Mass is seen to ride, It's Way it grinds, and plains the Mountain's Side. Gall'd with the Shot from far, the Legions join; Their Bucklers in the warlike Shell combine: Compact and close the brazen Roof they bear, And in just Order to the Walls draw near. Safe they advance, while with unweary'd Pain, The wrathful Engines waste their Stores in vain: High o'er their Heads the destin'd Deaths are toss'd, And far behind in vacant Earth are lost. Nor sudden could they change their erring Aim, Slow, and unweildy moves the cumbrous Frame. This seen, the Greeks their brawny Arms employ, And hurl a stony Tempest from on high: The clatt'ring Show'r the sounding Fence assails, In vain, as when the stormy Winter hails, Nor on the solid Roof at all prevails. But; tir'd at length, the Warriors fall their Shields, And, spent with Toil, the broken Phalanx yields. Now other Stratagems the War supplies, Beneath the Vinea close th' Assailant lies: The strong Machine, with Planks and Turf bespread, Moves to the Walls it's well-defended Head: Within the Covert safe the Miners lurk, And to the deep Foundation urge their Work. Now justly pois'd the thund'ring Ram they sling, And drive him forceful with a launching Spring: Hoping to loose some yielding Part at length, And shake the firm cemented Bulwark's Strength. But, from the Town, the sturdy Youth prepare With hardy Vigour to repel the War: Crouding they gather on the Rampart's Height, And with tough Staves, and Spears, maintain the Fight: Darts, Fragments of the Rock, and Flames they throw, And tear the planky Shelter fix'd below: Around by all the warring Tempest beat, The baffled Romans sullenly retreat. Now by Success the brave Massilians fir'd, To Fame of higher Enterprize aspir'd: Nor longer with their Walls Defence content, In daring Sallies they the Foe prevent. Nor arm'd with Swords, nor pointed Spears they go, Nor aim the Shaft, nor bend the deadly Bow: Fierce Mulciber supplies the bold Design, And for their Weapons kindling Torches shine. Silent they issue thro' the gloomy Night, And with broad Shields restrain the beamy Light. Sudden the Blaze on ev'ry Side began, And o'er the Latian Works resistless ran: Catching, and driving with the Wind it grows, Fierce thro' the Shade the burning Deluge glows: Nor Earth, nor greener Planks it's Force delay, Swift o'er the hissing Beams it rolls away. Embrown'd with Smoke the wavy Flames ascend, Shiver'd with Heat the crackling Quarries rend; Till with a Roar, at last, the mighty Mound, Tow'rs, Engines, all, come thund'ring to the Ground. Wide-spread the discontinuous Ruins lie, And vast Confusion fills the Gazer's Eye.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. III. The Twelve Signs of the Zodiac. See Equinoctial Line. The Leader Ram, all bright with golden Wool, Looks back, and wonders at the mighty Bull, Whose back Parts first appear: He bending lies With threatning Head, and calls the Twins to rise: They clasp for fear, and mutually embrace, Then comes the Crab with an unsteady Pace: Next him the angry Lion shakes his Mane: The following Maid abates his Rage again. Then Day and Night are ballanc'd in the Scales: Equal a while, at length the Night prevails: And longer grown the heavier Scale inclines, And draws the Scorpion from the Winter Signs. The Centaur follows, with an aiming Eye, His Bow full drawn, and ready to let fly: The twisted Goat his Horns contracted shows, The Water-Bearer's Urn a Flood o'erflows: Next their lov'd Waves the Fishes take their Seat, Join with the Ram, and make the Round compleat.— Creech alter'd. Pallas the Ram, and Venus guides the Bull, The Twins share Phœbus, and enjoy his Rule: The Crab is Mercury's; great Jove divides His Mother's Servant, and the Lion guides. Ceres the Maid, for this her Sheaf declares; And the fierce Scorpion owns the God of Wars. The Centaur Dian rules, and Vulcan claims The Scales, as the just Product of his Flames. The frozen Goat kind Vesta's Aid requires, She cheers his Cold, and warms him with her Fires. Just opposite to where her Husband sways, The Water-Bearer Juno's Rule obeys. The shining Fishes are to Neptune known, Sprung from the Sea, he claims them for his own.— Id. The Head comes under the Ram's Influence: The Bull commands the Neck: both Arms the Twins: The Breast is the Crab's Share: the Lion rules The Shoulders: and the Bowels claims the Maid: The Buttocks are the Scales' allotted Part: And o'er the Private Parts the Scorpion reigns: The Thighs the Archer loves: the Knees the Goat: The Water-Bearer o'er the Legs presides: The Fishes to the Feet Protection give.— Manil. Lib. IV. Silence. No Sorrow, no complaining Voice was heard: O'er all, one deep, one horrid Silence reigns: As when the Rigour of the Winter's Chains, All Nature, Heav'n, and Earth, at once constrains. The tuneful feather'd Kind forget their Lays, And shiv'ring tremble on the naked Sprays: Ev'n the rude Seas, compos'd, forget to roar, And freezing Billows stiffen on the Shore.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. I. Slavery. See Liberty. Medes, and Arabians, of the slavish East, Beneath eternal Bondage may be blest: While, of a diff'ring Mold and Nature, We, From Sire to Son accustom'd to be free, Feel Indignation rising in our Blood, And blush to wear the Chains that make them proud. Rowe. Lucan. Lib. VII. Then was our Offspring for all Ages lost! A Race of future Slaves receiv'd their Doom, And Children yet unborn were overcome. How shall our miserable Sons complain, That they are born beneath a Tyrant's Reign? Did our base Hands (with Justice shall they say,) The sacred Cause of Liberty betray? Why have our Fathers giv'n us up a Prey? Their Age to Our's the Curse of Bondage leaves; Themselves were Cowards, and begot us Slaves.— Id. Ibid. Then was the Time, when Sycophants began To heap all Titles on one lordly Man: Then learn'd our Sires that fawning, lying Strain, Which we, their slavish Sons, so well retain: Then, first, were seen to join, (an ill-match'd Pair!) The Ax of Justice with the Sword of War: Fasces, and Eagles, mingling march along, And in proud Cæsar's Train promiscuous throng. But while all Pow'rs in him alone unite, He mocks the People with the Shews of Right.— Id. Lucan. Lib. V. The Stag, superior both in Arms and Force, From out their common Pasture drove the Horse. The Vanquish'd flies to Man, to right his Cause, Begs Help, and takes the Bridle in his Jaws: But having beat the Victor, could not get Man from his Back, nor from his Mouth the Bit. Thus the mean Wretch, that fearing to be poor, Exchanges Liberty for shining Ore, Must bear a Lord, must ever be a Slave, Cause he knows not to use the Little Nature gave.— Creech alt. Hor. Lib. I. Epist. X. Slaughter. See Battle. Rout. Sea-Fight. Siege. Now unrelenting Mars, on either Side, Equall'd the Slaughter, and the mutual Deaths: The Victors and the Vanquish'd kill, and rush With equal Force: nor These, nor Those retreat.— Trap. Æn. Lib. X. —And now still more And more the Horror rises in the Field: —To Heav'n ascends A dismal Noise confus'd of warrior Youth, Groaning in Death, and gasping on the Ground.— Id. Æn. Lib. XII. Soon as the Lybian Horse their Onset make, With thund'ring Hoofs the sandy Soil they shake: Thick o'er the Plain the wavy Clouds arise, As when thro' Thrace, Bistonian Boreas flies, Involves the Day in Dust, and darkens all the Skies. And now the Foot encompass'd all around, Are massacred, and trodden to the Ground: None in Resistance vainly prove their Might, But Death is all the Business of the Fight. So thick the Darts and Javelins descend, That had they wounded not,— Their very Weight would make the Romans bend. On ev'ry Side the shrinking Front grows less, And to the Center madly all they press: Fear, Uproar, and Dismay, increase the Cry, Crushing, and crush'd, an armed Crowd they die: Ev'n thronging on their Fellows Swords they run, And the Foes Business by themselves is done.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. IV. As when Bellona drives the World to War, Or Mars comes thundring in his Thracian Car: Rage horrible darts from his Gorgon Shield, And gloomy Terror broods upon the Field. Hate, fell and fierce, the dreadful Gods impart, And urge to Slaughter ev'ry Soldier's Heart: The Many shout, Arms clash, the Wounded cry, And one promiscuous Peal groans upwards to the Sky.— Id. Lucan. Lib. VII. Sleep. Near the Cimmerians, lies a Cavern deep Within a Rock, the Court of lazy Sleep. This the Sun sees not at his Noon-tide Height, Nor cheers, with rising, or descending Light: But hazy Vapours from the Earth arise, And spread perpetual Twilight o'er the Skies. No wakeful Cocks, with early Crowings, dare Proclaim the Rise of rosy Morning there: No watchful Dogs, or more sagacious Geese, Disturb with Noise the everlasting Peace. No Voice of Beasts, no Winds among the Boughs, No human Sounds this Region ever knows. Here Silence reigns: yet from the Rock below, An Arm of Lethe, with a gentle Flow, Arising upwards, o'er the Pebbles creeps, And with soft Murmurs calls the coming Sleeps. Around the Entrance nodding Poppies grow, And num'rous Herbs that balmy Sleep bestow: Which Night extracting from their juicy Veins, Sheds as she passes o'er the dusky Plains. Least Doors should creak, and creaking hinder Sleep, No Door there was: no Guard the House to keep. Amidst the Cave was rais'd a lofty Bed, Stuff'd with black Down, and on an Ebon Sted: Black was the Cov'ring too, where lay the God, And slept supine, his Limbs display'd abroad. About his Head fantastic Visions fly, Which various Images of Things supply, And mock their Forms: the Leaves on Trees not more, Nor bearded Ears in Fields, nor Sands upon the Shore.— Dryden alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. II. The God his Eye-lids struggles to unloose, Seal'd, by his deep unbroken Slumbers, close: Half-way his Head he rears, with sluggish Pain, Which, heavy, sinks upon his Breast again: Frequent Attempts without Success he makes, But, at the last, with long Endeavours, wakes: Half-rais'd, and half-reclining on his Bed, Upon his Hand he leans his nodding Head.— Hopkins. Ibid. —Again he seeks his Bed, In whose soft Down he sinks his drooping Head: Again his Eye-lids are with Sleep opprest, And the whole God dissolves again to rest.— Id. Ibid. —O sacred Rest! Sweet pleasing Sleep! of all the Pow'rs the best! O Peace of Mind! Repairer of Decay, At whose Approach, Care, sullen, flies away: Whose Balm renews the weary'd Limbs to Labours of the Day.— Dryden. Ibid. Sweet Sleep despises not the Poor, Nor passes by the Cottage Door: He loves the Shades, he loves the Plains, And favours most the lowly Swains.— Fool, what is Sleep, but th' Image of cold Death? The Fates will grant a long long Time of Rest.— Ov. Am. IX. Sling. Mezentius quits his Arms, and round his Head Thrice whirls his sounding Sling: Shot from the Thong The Lead, half-melted as it flies, divides His Temples, and extends him on the Sand.— Trap. Æn. IX. As Tyrrhen stood high on the Galley's Prow, Sure aiming, from his Balearic Thong, Bold Lygdamus a pond'rous Bullet slung: Thro' liquid Air the Ball shrill whistling flies, And cuts its Way thro' hapless Tyrrhen's Eyes. Th' astonish'd Youth stands struck with sudden Night, While bursting start the bleeding Orbs of Sight.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. III. Sloth. See Effeminacy. With much adoe, his Book before him laid, And Parchment with the smoother Side display'd, He takes the Papers: lays 'em down again: And with unwilling Fingers tries the Pen. Some peevish Quarrel strait he strives to pick: His Quill writes double: or his Ink's too thick. Infuse more Water;—now 'tis grown so thin, It sinks, nor can the Characters be seen. O Wretch! and still more wretched ev'ry Day! Are Mortals born to dream their Lives away! Go back to what thy Infancy began, Thou who wert never meant to be a Man: Eat Pap and Spoon-meat: for thy Gewgaws cry: Be sullen, and refuse the Lullaby. No more accuse thy Pen, but charge the Crime On native Sloth, and Negligence of Time. Think'st Thou thy Master, or thy Friends, to cheat? Fool, 'tis Thyself, and that's a worse Deceit.— Dryden. Pers. Sat. III. Th' unfinish'd Tow'rs no longer rise: the Youth Undisciplin'd in Arms, no longer form Ports, and strong Fortresses of War: the Works Neglected stand: the Threat'nings of the Walls, And tall Machines no more invade the Sky: But, sticking in mid way, come short of Heav'n.— Trap. Æn. Lib. I. Rogues rise before 'tis Day to kill, and thieve: Will You not wake to save Yourself alive? If now, when well, you will not leave your Ease, In vain you'l try when prest with a Disease.— Creech. Hor. Lib. I. Epist. 2. Man's Understanding dull'd by Idleness, Contracts a Rust, that makes it daily less. Unless you often plow the fruitful Field, No Grain, but mixt with Thistles, will it yield. Ill runs the Horse, and hind-most in the Race, Who long has been unpractic'd in the Chace.— Ov. I. Trist. 12. Smallness. Creatures so small there are, their midmost Part, The sharpest Sight, by all the Helps of Art Assisted, cannot possibly descry: How fine are then the Guts, the Heart, the Eye? How fine each Limb, each Fibre of the whole? How infinitely fine the Texture of the Soul?— Lucret. Lib. IV. Society. See Man. People (First.) Between the Brutes and Us this Diff'rence lies: Jove did to them but Earth-born Life dispence, To Us, for mutual Aid, celestial Sense: From straggling Mountaineers, for publick Good, To rank in Tribes, and quit the savage Wood, Houses to build, and them contiguous make, For cheerful Neighbourhood and Safety's Sake: In War a common Standard to erect: A wounded Friend in Battle to protect: To march together at the Trumpet's Call, Sally from one Port, or man one public Wall.— Tate. Juv. Sat. XV. Solstice. From Capricorn, decreasing Nights appear, And Heav'n turns up the right Side of the Year: The Day proceeds to lengthen all the Way, Till high in Cancer rais'd, it makes a Stay: The Solstice then:—when Day and Night are found Equal to Day and Night that drove the Winter round. Then, by the said Degrees, again the Light, Decreasing, what it took returns to Night.— Creech. Manil. III. Soul. See Druids. Elysium. Hell. Manes. Purgatory. —Souls for ever live: But often their old Habitations leave, To dwell in new; which them, as Guests, receive. All alter, Nothing finally decays; Hither, and thither, still the Spirit strays: Free to all Bodies; out of Beasts it flies To Men, from Men to Beasts: and never dies. As pliant Wax each new Impression takes, Fixt to no Form, but still the Old forsakes, Yet is the same: so Souls the same abide, Tho' various Figures their Reception hide.— Sandys alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. XV. We know not yet the Soul: how 'tis produc'd: Whether with Body born, or else infus'd: Whether, in Death, breath'd out into the Air, She mix confus'dly with't, and perish there: Or thro' vast Shades, and horrid Silence go, To visit Brimstone Caves, and Pools below: Or into Beasts retires.— Creech. Lucret. Li Brave Souls when loos'd from this ignoble Chain Of Clay, and sent to their own Heav'n again, From Earth's gross Orb on Virtue's Pinions rise, In Æther wanton, and enjoy the Skies.— Creech alter'd. Manil. I. Who could know Heav'n, unless that Heav'n bestow'd The Knowledge? or find God, but Part of God? How could the Space immense be e'er confin'd Within the Compass of a narrow Mind? How could the Skies, the Dances of the Stars, Their Motions adverse, and eternal Wars, Unless kind Nature in our Breasts had wrought, Proportion'd Souls, be subject to our Thought.— Id. alt. Manil. Lib. II. Can any doubt that God resides in Man, That Souls from Heav'n descend, and when the Chain Of Life is broke, return to Heav'n again? As in the greater World, aspiring Flame, Earth, Water, Air, make the material Frame: And thro' the Members a commanding Soul Infus'd, directs the Motion of the Whole: So 'tis in Man, the lesser World: the Case Is Clay, unactive, and an earthly Mass: But the Blood's Streams the ruling Soul convey Thro ev'ry Part, to actuate the Clay. Then who can wonder that the World is known So well by Man, since he himself is One? The same Composure in his Form is shew'd, And Man's the little Image of the God.— Creech alter'd. Manil. Lib. IV. When once th' appointed Years are roll'd away, The passing Minds their former Load sustain, Are born a-new, and sheath'd in Flesh again.— Hughes. Claud. Rapt. Pros. Mean while whate'er was in the Pow'r of Flame Was all consum'd: his Body's nervous Frame No more was known, of human Form bereft: Th' eternal Part of Jove was only left. As an old Serpent, cast his scaly Vest, Writhes in the Sun, in youthful Glory drest: So when Alcides' mortal Mold resign'd, His better Part enlarg'd, and grew refin'd: August his Visage shone: Almighty Jove In his swift Car his honour'd Offspring drove: High o'er the hollow Clouds the Coursers fly, And lodge the Hero in the starry Sky.— Gay. Ovid. Met. Lib. IX. Dying Reflections of the Emperor Adrian. Poor little, pretty, flutt'ring Thing! Must we no longer live together? And dost Thou prune thy trembling Wing, To take thy Flight Thou know'st not whither? Thy humorous Vein, thy pleasing Folly Lies all neglected, all forgot: And pensive, wav'ring, melancholy, Thou dread'st, and hop'st, Thou know'st not what.— Prior. Ah fleeting Spirit! wandring Fire That long has warm'd my tender Breast! Must Thou no more this Frame inspire? No more a pleasing chearful Guest? Whither, ah whither art Thou flying! To what dark undiscover'd Shore? Thou seem'st all trembling, shiv'ring, dying, And Wit and Humour are no more.— Pope. Speech. Nature the Power of framing Sounds affords To Man, but 'twas Convenience taught us Words. As Infants now for Want of Words devise Expressive Signs, and speak with Hands and Eyes: Their speaking Hand the Want of Words supplies. But, that one Man the Names of Things contriv'd, And that from him their Knowledge all deriv'd, 'Tis fond to think: for how could that Man tell The Names of Things, or speak a Syllable, And not another Man do so as well? Besides, if Others us'd not Words as soon, How was their Profit and Convenience known? Or how could he instruct the Other's Mind? Or make them understand what he design'd? Since being single, neither Force nor Wit Could conquer many, or make them submit To learn his Words, or e'en with Patience bear A meanless Jargon rattling in their Ear?— Lucret. Lib. V. Therefore since proper Parts, since Voice, and Tongue, By Nature's Gift bestow'd, to Man belong, Where lies the Wonder, that Mankind should frame For ev'ry diff'rent Thing a diff'rent Name? Since even brute Creatures make a diff'rent Noise, Oppress'd by Pains, or Fears, or fill'd with Joys.— Creech alt. Ibid. Spring. See Seasons. Venus. Year. When Winter ends, and Spring serenely shines; Then fat the Lambs, and mellow are the Wines: Then soft the Slumbers on the verdant Ground; Then with thick Shades the lofty Mountain's crown'd.— An. Virg. Georg. Lib. I. The Spring to Forests yields a kindly Aid: To Woods the Spring restores the useful Shade: In the kind Spring the Lands abound with Juice, And ask for Seeds that give a large Produce. Then the All-potent Air, prolific Showers On the soft Lap of his glad Consort pours: From her vast Womb the mighty Store proceeds, And all, the mighty He commix'd, with Plenty feeds. The Birds their Songs repeat to ev'ry Grove; And Herds perceive the Season of their Love: Then teem the Fields, and make their Bosoms bare To the warm Breezes of the western Air. Then kindly Moisture over all Things sheds: Plants trust new Suns, and boldly rear their Heads: Nor fears the Vine lest southern Storms should rise, Or the rough North pour Rivers from the Skies: But boldly shoots her Buds from ev'ry Bough, And all her Leaves displays with pompous Show. So dawn'd the Days, such was, methinks, their Course In the weak Childhood of the Universe: Then Spring was all, for then the mighty Ring, Roll'd, free from Winter's Storms, in constant Spring.— Id. alt. Virg. Geor. Lib. II. And now the Fields all teem, and every Tree: Now bloom the Groves, now smiles the beauteous Year.— Trap. Virg. Ecl. III. Seas then lie husht: then Earth grows bold to bear, And trusts young Flow'rs to the serener Air: Then Beasts in Fields, and Birds in every Grove, Press on with Fury, to consummate Love. With joyous Song the vocal Forests ring, And various Leaves adorn the gaudy Spring: With such brisk Powers are Nature's Parts possest, When, wak'd, she rouses from her Winter's Rest.— Creech. Manil. Lib. III. Sharp Winter melts, Favonius spreads his Wing, And brings a pleasing Change, the smiling Spring. Ships from the Docks are now drawn out again, And spread their Canvas on the curling Main. Nor Stalls the Ox, nor Fires the Clown delight, Nor Frosts no longer cloth the Fields in White. The Nymphs and Graces joyn'd, thro' flowry Meads, By Moon-light dance, and lovely Venus leads. Nimbly they shift their Feet, and shake the Ground, While Vulcan lab'ring at his Forge is found. Then crown'd with Myrtle be, or fragant Flow'rs, Rais'd from the loos'ned Earth by balmy Show'rs: To Faunus offer, in the sacred Groves, A Lamb, or Kid, which e'er he best approves.— Creech alt. Hor. I. Ode. 4. The Snows are gone, behold a World's new Face! How Grass the Ground, how Leaves their Branches grace. The Streams that lately over-flow'd the Grounds, Now gently glide within their proper Bounds. The Nymphs and Graces naked dance around, And nimbly o'er the flow'ry Meadows bound.— Hor. L. IV. Ode 7. The Spring, the new, the warbling Spring appears, The youthful Season of reviving Years: In Spring the Loves enkindle mutual Heats, The feather'd Nations chuse their tuneful Mates: The Trees grow fruitful with descending Rain, And drest in diff'ring Greens adorn the Plain.— Parnel. Now Bulls o'er Stalks of Broom extend their Sides, Secure of Favours from their lowing Brides. Now stately Rams their fleecy Consorts lead, Who bleating follow thro' the winding Shade. And now the Goddess bids the Birds appear, Raise all their Musick, and salute the Year: Then deep the Swan begins, and deep the Song Runs o'er the Water where he sails along: While Philomela tunes a treble Strain, And from the Poplar charms the list'ning Plain.— Id. Cat. Pervig. Veneris. The Stage. Thespis, 'tis said, did Tragedy devise. Unknown before, and rude at it's first Rise, In Carts the Gypsy-Actors strol'd about, Their Faces smear'd with Lees of Wine and Soot, And thro' the Towns amus'd the wond'ring Rout. Then Æschylus brought Masks and Habits in, And built a Play-House, and contriv'd a Scene, The buskin'd Heroes taught, with Grace and Art To tread the Stage, and boldly speak their Part.— Oldham alter'd. Hor. Art. Poet. He, who at first in Tragick Numbers wrote, (When the poor Poet labour'd for a Goat,) Brought in his Satyrs naked to divert And mix'd the comick with the serious Part: This was the Bait to bribe the Crowd to stay, When drunk and wanton, and sit out the Play. No Flute, or Trumpet, grac'd the antient Scene, But Pipes whose Stops were few, and Model mean. Such gain'd Applause, and pleas'd in former Days, When to be chast and modest was a Praise, When Folks lov'd Thrift, and few frequented Plays. But after Rome had stretch'd her Conquests round, And wider Walls enlarg'd the City's Bound: Then Bards in bolder Strains began to sing, And form'd their Numbers to the tuneful String. Then graceful Motion, and a pompous Dress, Gave to the growing Stage deserv'd Success: The Lyre in more melodious Style was heard, And Art in all it's Elegance appear'd: With manly Sense sweet Elocution flow'd, And spoke prophetick as the Delphick God.— Ames alt. Ibid. Stars. See Chance. Orion. Pilot. The glittering Stars at equal Distance lie, Make various Shapes, and chequer all the Sky. Above them Nought: to the World's Top they rose, Painting the Roof of Nature's common House: Which in a wide Embrace does all contain, The spacious Air, the Earth, and raging Main. They set in order, and in order rise, As West drives down, or East brings up the Skies.— Creech. Manil. Lib. I. So thick with Stars the Skies are spangled o'er, That not the Sands upon the winding Shore, That not the Billows in tempestuous Floods, That not the Leaves when Autumn shakes the Woods, Can shew their Number.—Numbers they surmount; Arithmetick is lost in the Account.— And as in Cities, where, in Ranks decreed, First Nobles go, and then the Knights succeed; A Right to come the next the People claim; The Rabble last, a Croud without a Name. So are the Heav'ns by different Stars possest: Some, like the Nobles, with more Rays are drest, Some shine with less, the num'rous Croud with least. Were these endow'd with a proportion'd Heat, Were they in Pow'r, as they're in Number great, They, long agoe, must have dissolv'd the Frame, Nor could the World have born so fierce a Flame.— Id. Manil. Lib. V. Style. See Authors. Poetry. Poets. Let Writers match their Subject to their Strength, And often try what Weight they can support, And what their Shoulders are too weak to bear: After a serious and judicious Choice, Method and Eloquence will never fail.— Roscommon. Hor. Art. Poet. Men ever had, and ever will have leave To coin new Words, well suited to the Age. Words are like Leaves; some wither ev'ry Year, And ev'ry Year a younger Race succeeds. Death is a Tribute all Things owe to Fate. Why then should Words challenge Eternity, When greatest Men, and greatest Actions die? Use may revive the obsoletest Words, And banish those that now are most in Vogue: Use is the Judge, and Law, and Rule of Speech.— Id. Ib. Good Sense must be the certain Standard still, To All, that e'er pretend to Writing well: Chuse but a Subject which You throughly know, And Words, unsought, therefrom with Ease will flow.— Ibid. Who knows the Duty of all Ranks of Men, And what we owe to Country, Parents, Friends, How Judges, and how Senators should act, And what becomes a General to do, And give to all their proper Characters.— Roscom. Ibid. —Heraclitus whom vain Greeks admire For dark Expression: but the sober few, Who seek for, and delight in what is true, Scorn and contemn:—for Fools alone regard What seems obscure, and intricate, and hard: Take that for Truth whose Phrases smooth appear, And dancing Periods charm the wanton Ear.— Creech. Lucret. L. I. Mark where a bold expressive Phrase appears, Bright thro' the Rubbish of some hundred Years: Command old Words that long have slept, to wake; Such as wise Bacon, or brave Raleigh spake: Or bid the New be English Ages hence, (For Use will father what's begot by Sense.) Pour the full Tide of Eloquence along, Serenely pure, and yet divinely strong, Rich with the Treasures of each foreign Tongue. Prune the Luxuriant, the Uncouth refine, But shew no Mercy on an empty Line: Then polish all with so much Life and Ease, You think 'tis Nature, and a Knack to please.— Pope. Hor. Lib. II. Epist. 2. I lose my Patience, and I own it too, When Works are censur'd, not as bad, but new: While if our Elders break all Reason's Laws, These Fools demand not Pardon, but Applause. He who to seem more deep than You or I, Extols old Bards, or Merlin's Prophecy, Mistake him not: he envies, not admires, And to debase the Sons exalts the Sires. Had antient Times conspir'd to disallow What then was new, what had been antient now? Or what remain'd, so worthy to be read By learned Criticks, of the mighty Dead?— Id. Hor. Lib. II. Epist. 1. Storm at Land. See Tempest. Oft have I seen, when now the Farmer brought The Reaper to his yellow Fields, and bound His Sheaves with brittle Straw, the warring Winds All rise at once, and from the Roots uprend His full-ear'd Corn, and whirl it high in Air. With such a Gust an Hurricane would drive Light flying Stubble.—Oft too Floods immense Of Waters gush from Heav'n: and gather'd Clouds Brew the black Storm aloft, with dusky Show'rs: The rushing Sky descends, and with vast Rain Drowns the rich Crop, and Labours of the Plough. The hollow Dykes are fill'd: with roaring Noise The foaming Rivers swell: and in the Friths Toss'd by the Winds the wintry Ocean boils. Great Jove himself, amidst the Night of Clouds, Hurls with his red Right-hand the forky Fire: Earth trembles: Savage Beasts to Covert fly: And Mortals Hearts, o'er all the World, with Dread Sink shudd'ring, and appall'd.— —With redoubled Force The Winds condense the Tempest: Woods roar loud With struggling Blasts: and Rivers lash their Shores.— Trap. Virg. Georg. Lib. I. Like Boreas in his Race, when rushing forth, He sweeps the Skies, and clears the cloudy North: The waving Harvest bends beneath his Blast, The Forest shakes, the Groves their Honours cast: He flies aloft, and with impetuous Roar, Pursues the foaming Surges to the Shore.— Dryden. Virg. Georg. Lib. III. So, when the Winds in airy Conflict rise, Here South and West charge dreadful in the Skies, There louder Eurus, to the Battle born, Mounts the swift Coursers of the purple Morn: Beneath the Whirlwind roar the bending Woods: With his huge Trident Neptune strikes the Floods, Foams, Storms, and tempesting the Deeps around, Bares the broad Bosom of the dark Profound.— Pitt. Virg. Æn. Lib. II. —Black with rushing Rain A Tempest rag'd enormous, and the Hills And Fields with Thunder shook: o'er all the Sky A Shower with Water dark, and thickned Winds, Turbid descends.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. V. Storm at Sea. Shipwreck. Now got from Shore, a Breeze began to blow, The Sailors ship their Oars, and cease to Row: Then hoist their Yards a-trip, and all their Sails Let fall, to court the Winds, and catch the Gales. The Vessel scarce half Way, at most no more, By this had run, far off from either Shore, When, in the Night, the foaming Billows rise, And the fierce East-Wind blusters thro' the Skies.— Dryd. alt. At this, the Master soon began to cry, Strike, strike the Topsail: let the Main-sheet fly, And furl your Sails:—the Winds repel the Sound, And in the Speaker's Mouth the Speech is drown'd. Yet of their own accord, as Danger taught, Each in his Way, officiously they wrought: Some stow their Oars, or stop the leaky Sides: Another bolder yet, the Yard bestrides, And folds the Sails: A fourth with Labour laves Th' intruding Seas, and Waves ejects on Waves. In this Confusion while their Work they ply, The Winds augment the Winter of the Sky, And wage intestine War: the suff'ring Seas Are toss'd and mingl'd, as their Tyrants please. The Master would command, but in despair Of Safety, stands amaz'd with stupid Care: Nor what to bid, or what forbid he knows, Th' ungovern'd Tempest to such Fury grows: Vain is his Force, and vainer is his Skill, With such a Concourse comes the Flood of Ill. The Cries of Men are mixt with rattling Shrowds: Seas dash on Seas, and Clouds encounter Clouds: At once from East to West, from Pole to Pole, The forky Lightnings flash, the roaring Thunders roll.— Dryd. Now Waves on Waves ascending from on high, Seas mix with Clouds, and dash against the Sky: Now from the Bottom yellow Sands they lave: Now black: alike in Colour shews the Wave: Now white with Froth appear the flatted Seas: The Vessel shifts, and changes, as they please. As on a Mountain-Top, she rides on high, And from the Clouds beholds the nether Sky: Then sinking with the Wave on which she rose, Down to the Bottom of the Deep she goes: Whence, as from Hell's Abyss, they lift their Sight, And, distant far, see Heav'n's superior Light.— Dryd. alt. The lashing Billows make a loud Report, And beat her Sides, as batt'ring Rams a Fort: Or as chaff'd Lions, with redoubled Rage, Rush with a Roar, and pointed Spears engage: So Seas by Winds impell'd, with added Pow'r, Assault the Sides, and o'er the Hatches tow'r.— Id. alt. The Planks (their pitchy Cov'ring wash'd away) Now yield: and now a yawning Breach display: The roaring Waters, with a hostile Tide, Rush thro' the Ruins of her gaping Side.— Mean time the Sky descends in Sheets of Rain: You'd think all Heav'n were pouring on the Main: One rising, falling one, the Heav'ns and Sea Meet at their Confines in the middle Way. The Sails are drunk with Show'rs, and drop with Rain; Sweet Waters mingle with the briny Main. No Star appears to lend it's friendly Light; Darkness and Tempest make a double Night. But flashing Fires disclose the Deep by turns, And while the Lightnings blaze, the Water burns.— Dryd. The bounding Billows now her Deck possess'd: And as some Soldier, braver than the rest, Who oft to scale a City's Wall essays, At last succeeds, and fir'd with Hopes of Praise, Amongst a thousand gains the Wall alone: So, while the rolling Waves come raging on, The Hero Tenth, high tow'ring o'er her Sides, Claims all the Vessel, and in triumph rides. Waves urg'd by Waves the Bark without assail, Waves too are got within.— The frighted Crew all tremble and look pale: As in a City, whose surrounding Wall, Part of the Foe is batt'ring to it's fall, While part, a Passage forc'd, with Sword in Hand, Destruction threaten, and within command.— Art fails, and Courage falls: no Succour near: As many Waves, as many Deaths appear. One weeps and wails, despairing of Relief: One stupid stands, his Fears congeal his Grief: One loud laments his miserable State, And calls those happy whom their Fun'rals wait. This Wretch with Pray'rs and Vows the Gods adores, Uplifts his useless Hands,— And Aid from Heav'n, from Heav'n unseen, implores: That on his Friends at home his Thoughts bestows, His Parents, Brethren, and his dearer Spouse: His House, his Children, fill Another's Mind; And each deplores what He shall leave behind.— Dryd. alt. The giddy Ship ran round: The Tempest tore Her Mast, and over-board the Rudder bore. One Billow mounts, and with a scornful Brow, Proud of her Conquest gain'd, insults the Waves below; Nor lighter falls, than if some Gyant tore Pindus and Athos with the Freight they bore, And toss'd on Seas: press'd with the pond'rous Blow, Down sinks the Ship within th' Abyss below: Down with the Vessel sink into the Main The Many, never more to rise again. Some few on scatter'd Planks, with fruitless Care, Lay hold, and swim, but while they swim, despair.— Dryd. Ovid. Met. Lib XI. —Out rush the Winds, Thronging, where way they find: with giddy Whirls Scour o'er the Lands, and then with Fury fall Upon the Sea: East, South, and stormy West, Together, from it's lowest Caverns rouse The Deep: and roll vast Billows to the Shore. Cracking of Cordage, and the Cries of Men Succeed: by sudden Clouds the Heavens and Day Are ravish'd from the Trojans Eyes: Dun Night Lies hovering o'er the Sea: loud Thunder rocks The Poles: the Sky with nimble Lightning glares: And ev'ry Object threatens present Death.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. I. —The Tempest from the North, Loud roaring, struck across the Sails, and toss'd The Billows to the Stars: the Oars are stav'd: The Prow inclines, and on the Surges lays It's Side: a Mountain-heap of Waves succeeds. Ibid. From Prow to Stern a mighty Billow strikes Full o'er the Ship: the Master, swept from Deck, Rolls headlong: her the circling Eddy thrice Works round, and swallows in the rapid Gulf.— Id. Ib. Now from the Sight of Land our Gallies move, With only Seas around, and Skies above: When o'er our Heads descends a Burst of Rain, And Night with sable Clouds involves the Main: The ruffling Winds the foamy Billows raise: The scatter'd Fleet is driven several Ways: The Face of Heav'n is ravish'd from our Eyes, And in redoubled Peals the roaring Thunder flies. Cast from our Coast, we wander in the dark: No Stars to guide, no point of Land to mark. No Difference to the Pilot did appear 'Twixt Night and Day: nor knew he how to steer. Three star-less Nights the doubtful Navy strays, We know not whither, and three sunless Days. The fourth renews the Light, and from our Shrowds We view a rising Land, like distant Clouds: The Mountain Tops confirm the pleasing Sight, And curling Smoke ascending from their Height. The Canvas falls: their Oars the Sailors ply: From their strong Strokes the whirling Waters fly.— Dryd. Virg. Æn. III. Suicide. See Despair. Lover desponding. Now to the inmost Court fierce Dido flies, And rolls with ghastly Looks her glaring Eyes: Tho' pale, and shiv'ring, at her purpos'd Doom, And ev'ry dreadful Thought of Death to come, Yet many a crimson Flush, with various Grace, Glows on her Cheek, and kindles in her Face. Furious she mounts the Pyre, and draws the Sword, The fatal Present of the Dardan Lord: For no such End bestow'd. The conscious Bed, And Robes she view'd, and Tears in Silence shed: Stood still, and paus'd a Moment:—Then she cast Her Body on the Couch, and spoke her last. Ye dear, dear Relicks of the Man I lov'd, While Fate consented, and the Gods approv'd, Relieve my Woes, this Rage of Love controul, Take my last Breath, and catch my parting Soul. My fatal Course is finish'd, and I go A Ghost majestic to the Realms below: Happy! thrice happy! if the Dardan Band Had never touch'd upon the Lybian Land. Then pressing with her Lips the Trojan Bed, Shall I then die, and unreveng'd? (she said,) Yet die I will:—and thus, and thus, I go— Thus—fly with Pleasure, to the Shades below. Mean time, the sad Attendants as she spoke, Beheld her strike, and sink beneath the Stroke. At once her snowy Hands were purpled o'er, And the bright Faulchion smoak'd with streaming Gore.— Pitt. With sudden Shrieks the Palace rings around: The long, long Cries, from Street to Street resound: Nothing is heard but Groans and Women's Cries, And loud Laments re-echo thro' the Skies.— Id. alt. Æn. Lib. IV. A Rock there stood, whose Side the beating Waves Had long consum'd, and hollow'd into Caves: The Head shot forwards in a bending Steep, And cast a dreadful Covert o'er the Deep. The wretched Ino, on Destruction bent, Climb'd up the Cliff: such Strength her Fury lent: Thence with her guiltless Boy, who wept in vain, At one bold Spring she plung'd into the Main.— Eusden. Ovid Met. Lib. IV. He who could often, and alone, withstand The Foe, the Fire, and Jove's own partial Hand, Now cannot his un-master'd Grief sustain, But yields to Rage, to Madness, and Disdain. Then snatching out his Faulchion, Thou, said He, Art mine:—or lays Ulysses claim to Thee? O often try'd, and ever trusty Sword, Now do thy last kind Office to thy Lord: 'Tis Ajax who requests thy Aid, to show, None but himself, himself could overthrow. He said, and with so good a Will to die, Did to his Breast the fatal Point apply, It found his Heart: a Way till then unknown, Where never Weapon enter'd, but his own. No Hands could force it thence, so fixt it stood, Till out it rush'd, expell'd by Streams of spouting Blood.— Dryd. Ovid. Met. Lib. XIII. Vulteius, one of Cæsar's Officers, with a thousand Men under his Command, being intercepted by Pompey's Party, and unable either to escape, or defend himself, against the Attack which he expected the next Morning, thus encouraged his Soldiers to destroy themselves; which they did accordingly.My gallant Friends! whom our hard Fates decree, This Night, this short Night only, to be free: Think what remains to do, but think with Haste, E'er the brief Hour of Liberty be past. Perhaps, reduc'd to this so hard Extream, Too short, to some, the Date of Life may seem: Yet know, brave Youths! that none untimely fall, Whom Death obeys, and comes but when they call. 'Tis true, the neighb'ring Danger waits us nigh: We meet but that from which we cannot fly: Yet think not with inferior Praise we die. Dark and uncertain is Man's fatal Doom: If Years, or only Moments, are to come, All is but Dying: he who gives an Hour, Or he that gives an Age, gives all that's in his Pow'r. Sooner or late, all Mortals know the Grave, But to chuse Death distinguishes the Brave. Behold where, waiting round, yon hostile Band, Our Fellow-Citizens, our Lives demand. Prevent we then their cruel Hands, and bleed:— Tis but to do what is too sure decreed, And where our Fate would drag us on, to lead. Is there a gen'rous Youth, Vulteius cry'd, Whose worthy Sword may pierce your Leader's Side? He said: and at the Word, from ev'ry Part, An hundred pointed Weapons reach'd his Heart. Dying he prais'd 'em all, but him the chief, Whose eager Duty brought the first Relief: Deep in his Breast he plung'd the deadly Blade, And with a grateful Stroke the friendly Gift repaid. At once all rush, at once to Death they fly, And on each others Swords alternate dye.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. IV. Summer. See Seasons. Year. In Heav'n's high Arch, and on the utmost Line Of Summer's Progress, Cancer seats his Sign: There stretches out the greatest Length of Day, And then declines, and makes it soon decay: But all the Time, which, as he bears the Light, He takes from Day, he still returns to Night. Then Corn grows yellow on the fruitful Soil, And lusty Reapers bear their Arms for Toil: Then Seas grow warm, the Flood forbears to roar, And Billows languish on the quiet Shore. Then Mars goes forth, nor is the Scythian Coast From Roman Arms defended by her Frost. Thus lies the World, when with exalted Ray, I' th' Summer Solstice, Phœbus bears the Day Thro' Cancer's Sign, and drives the highest Way.— Creech. Manil. Lib. III. The Sun is in the Lion mounted high: The Syrian Star Barks from afar, And with his sulty Breath infects the Sky. The Shepherd drives his fainting Flock, Beneath the Covert of a Rock, And seeks refreshing Riv'lets nigh: The Sylvans to their Shades retire, Those very Shades and Streams new Shades and Streams require: And want a cooling Breeze of Wind to fan the raging Fire.— Dryden. Hor. Lib. III. Od. 29. Fields Corn produce, when Syrius' Star appears, And annual Harvests wave their yellow Ears.— Tibul. Lib. II El. 1. Sun. See Chance. Palace of the Sun. The Sun's bright Palace, on high Columns rais'd, With burnish'd Gold, and flaming Rubies blaz'd: The Roof with polish'd Iv'ry was inlaid, The folding Doors a silver Light display'd. Rich was the Ground on which the Work was wrought, But far inferior to the Workman's Thought: For in the Portal was display'd on high, (The Work of Vulcan) a fictitious Sky: A waving Sea th' inferior Earth embrac'd, And Gods and Goddesses the Waters grac'd. Ægeon here a mighty Whale bestrode: Triton, and Proteus, (the deceiving God) With Doris here were carv'd, and all her Train: Some loosely swimming in the figur'd Main, While some on Rocks their dropping Hair divide, And some on Fishes thro' the Waters glide. Tho' various Features did the Sisters grace, A Sister's Likeness was in ev'ry Face. On Earth a different Prospect courts the Eyes, Men, Towns, and Beasts in distant Prospect rise, And Nymphs, and Streams, and Woods, and rural Deities. High above all Heav'n's bright Effigies shines; And on each Gate are six refulgent Signs.— Addison. Ov. Met. Lib. II. Phoebus, or the Sun. In purple Robes sat Phœbus on his Throne, That with the Blaze of lucid Em'ralds shone. The Hours, in equal Rows, on either Hand, And Days, and Months, and Years, and Ages stand. There stood the Spring, her Head with Flowers bound; There Summer, naked, and with Wheat Ears crown'd: There Autumn, stain'd with purple Juice, appear'd, And icy Winter, with his hoary Beard.— Addison alt. Ibid. I am the God who measure out the Year, The World's vast Eye, of Light the Source serene, Which all Things sees, by which all Things are seen.— Ov. Met. Lib. IV. Chariot of the Sun. Gold was the Axle, and the Beam was Gold: The Wheels, with silver spokes, on golden Circles roll'd. Gems set in Rows adverse, and sparkling bright, Reflected on the God the dazling Light. When Phœbus saw the Moon's pale Horns withdrawn, And the World round him red'ning at the Dawn, He bid the nimble Hours his Steeds array With Harness: strait the Goddesses obey: From their high Mangers with Ambrosia fed, And breathing Flame, the gen'rous Beasts they led: And fit the ratling Bridles.— Mean while hot Pyroeis, with Eöus join'd, With Æthon Fleet, and Phlegon wild as Wind, The Sun's swift Steeds, each other's Rage provoke, Neighing aloud, and snorting Fire and Smoke.— Trap. They spring together forth, and swiftly bear Their rapid Course thro' Clouds and yielding Air: With winged Speed outstrip the Eastern Wind, And leave the Breezes of the Morn behind.— Dryden. Ibid. The Disk of Phœbus, when he climbs on high, Appears at first but as a bloodshot Eye: And when his Chariot downward drives to Bed, His Ball is with the same Suffusion red: But mounted high in his meridian Race, All bright he shines, and with a fairer Face: For there, pure Particles of Ether flow, Far from th' Infection of the World below.— Dryden. Ovid. Met. Lib. XV. In pleasant Vales, beneath th' Hesperian Sky, For the Sun's fiery Steeds green Pastures lie: Ambrosia there they eat, and thence they gain New Vigour, and their daily Toils sustain.— Eusden. Ovid. Met. Lib. IV. Superstition. How Egypt, mad with Superstition grown, Makes Gods of Monsters, but too well is known: One Sect Devotion to Nile's Serpent pays, Others to Ibis, that on Serpents preys. Where, Thebes, thy hundred Gates lie unrepair'd, And where maim'd Memnon's magic Harp is heard, Amidst their Ruins, wondrous to behold, A Monkey's sacred Statue glows with Gold. Fish-Gods you'll meet, with Fins and Scales o'ergrown: Diana's Dog's ador'd in ev'ry Town: The Dog has Temples, but the Goddess none! 'Tis mortal Sin an Onion to devour, Each Clove of Garlick is a sacred Power. Religious Nations sure, and blest Abodes, Where ev'ry Orchard is o'er-run with Gods! To kill, is Murder, Sacriledge to eat A Kid, or Lamb:—Man's Flesh is lawful Meat.— Tate alt. Juv. Sat. XV. Athens does Pallas, Cynthia Crete adore, Vulcan is pray'd to on the Lemnian Shore, Altars to Juno are at Sparta rais'd, Faunus th' Arcadians worship,— And Mars, at Latium, is the God that's prais'd.— Ovid. Fast. Lib. III. The Jews, like their bigotted Sires before, Do nothing but the Juvenal probably alludes to God's Presence in the Cloud upon Mount Sinai. Clouds and Heav'n adore: So superstitious, that they'll sooner dine Upon the Flesh of Men, than that of Swine. Our Roman Customs they despise and jeer, But learn and keep their Country Rites with Fear. That Worship only they in Rev'rence have, Which in dark Volumes their great Moses gave. Ask 'em the Road, and they shall point you wrong, Because you do not to their Tribe belong. They'll not betray a Spring to quench your Thirst, Unless you shew 'em Circumcision first. So they are taught, and do it to obey Their Fathers, who devote the Seventh Day To Idleness, nor will thereon perform The least Concern of Life.— Dryden junr. Juv. Sat. XIV. Old Images, of Form mishapen, stand, Rude and unknowing of the Artist's Hand: With hoary Filth begrim'd each ghastly Head Strikes the astonish'd Gazer's Soul with Dread. No Gods, who long in common Shapes appear'd, Were e'er with such religious Awe rever'd: But zealous Crowds in Ignorance adore, And still the less they know, they fear the more.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. III. When the bright Dog-Star o'er Calabria reigns, And parches with excessive Heat her Plains, The stupid Peasants, struck with annual Fear, Assembled in some ancient Grove appear: In superstitious Rites they pass the Day, And, as the Priest directs, the Wretches pray.— Val. Flac. Arg. Lib. I. Ombus and Tentyr, neighb'ring Towns, of late Broke into Outrage of deep-fester'd Hate: A Grudge in both, Time out of Mind begun, Was mutually bequeath'd from Sire to Son. Religious Spight and pious Spleen bred first This Quarrel, which the headstrong Bigots nurs'd. Each calls the Other's God a senseless Stock, His own divine.— Tate. Juv. Sat. XV. From servile Fear the fancy'd Gods first came; For when the Lightnings, with impetuous Flame, Proud Walls beat down, and lofty Athos fir'd, Religious Horror ev'ry Breast inspir'd: Lustrations strait were paid the radiant Sun, And changing Cynthia heav'nly Honours won. Hence Idol-Crowds the tim'rous World o'erflow'd, And not one Month but had its Patron God. By such an Impotence of Mind betray'd, The Swain to Ceres Autumn-Honours paid: Bacchus was crown'd with Clusters of the Vine, And from the Sheep-Cote Pales grew divine: Neptune was set to rule the Ocean's Tide, And Pallas o'er deep Caverns to preside. Each, as his Guilt or Av'rice prompts Deceit, Invents new Gods, and aids the pious Cheat.— Addison jun. Petron. Arb. Our Superstitions with our Life begin: The good old Grandame, or the next of Kin, The new-born Infant from the Cradle takes, And of her Spittle a Lustration makes: Then in the Spawl her middle Finger dips, And dawbs the Temples, Forehead, and the Lips, Of Evil Eyes the Mischiefs to prevent, By Virtue of her nasty Excrement.— Dryden. Pers. Sat. II. The Mother, whose dear Son has lain oppress'd By a cold Quartan, half a Year at least, Gets up betimes, and prays;—O mighty Jove! Who dost Diseases bring, and dost remove, If Thou wilt stop the Fits, restore my Joy, And spare the Body of my lovely Boy, At thy next solemn Fast, Thou gracious God! I'll set him naked in cold Tiber's Flood. And, now, let Chance, or Nature's Strength release, Or Physick's Force suppress the long Disease, The frantic Mother will perform her Vow, And her weak Son into the Tiber throw: The Cold brings a Relapse, and kills the Lad: And hath not Superstition made her mad?— Creech alter'd. Hor. Lib. II. Sat. 3. Swimming. Playful, and wanton, to the Stream he trips, And dips his Foot, and shivers as he dips: The Coolness pleas'd him, and with eager Haste, His airy Garment on the Bank he cast. Now, all undrest, upon the Shore he stood, And clap'd his Sides, and leapt into the Flood: His skilful Limbs the limpid Waves divide, And shine more lovely thro' the silver Tide: As iv'ry Figures which the Life surpass, Or Lillies cover'd with a Chrystal Glass.— Addison alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. IV. Cloath'd, as Hercules. he stood, in the fierce Lion's Hide, The laden Quiver o'er his Shoulders ty'd, (For cross the Stream his Bow and Club were cast) Swift he plung'd in: These Billows shall be past, He said: nor sought where smoother Waters glide, But stem'd the Dangers of the rapid Tide.— Gay. Ovid. Met. Lib. IX. Swooning. —The Chief she knew, Tho' mournful all, and ghastly was his Hue: Rude, o'er his Face, his hoary Locks were grown, And Dust obscene was cast upon his Gown. She saw; and fainting, sunk in sudden Night: Grief stop'd her Breath, and shut out loathsom Light: The loos'ning Nerves no more their Force exert, And Motion ceas'd within the freezing Heart: Death kindly seem'd her Wishes to obey, And, stretch'd upon the Ground, a Coarse she lay.— Rowe alt. Lucan. Lib. VII. —Her Maids support Her Body, as she sinks into their Arms And lay her fainting on the Royal Bed.— Trap. Æn. Lib. IV. When Fear's strong Agonies the Mind oppress, Each suff'ring Member shews the Soul's Distress: Cold Sweats and Paleness o'er the Body rise, And Speech and Voice the failing Tongue denies; With Noise the Ears are fill'd; the Eyes grow dim; And Tremblings seize on ev'ry languid Limb.— Lucret. Lib. III. Temperance. See Extravagance. Gluttony. Luxury. What, and how great, the Virtue and the Art To live on little with a cheerful Heart! Hear Bethel's Sermon, one not vers'd in Schools, But strong in Sense, and wise without the Rules. Go work, hunt, exercise; (he thus began,) Then scorn a homely Dinner if You can. Your Wine lock'd up, your Butler stroll'd abroad, Or kept from Fish, (the River yet unthaw'd,) If then plain Bread and Milk will do the Feat, The Pleasure lies in You, and not the Meat.— Pope. Hor. Lib. II. Sat. 2. Now hear what Blessings Temperance can bring. First Health: The Stomach (cramm'd from ev'ry Dish, A Tomb of boil'd, and roast, and Flesh, and Fish, Where Bile, and Wind, and Phlegm, and Acid jar, And all the Man is one intestine War,) Remembers oft the School-Boy's simple Fare, The temp'rate Sleeps, and Spirits light as Air.— Id. Ibid. Tempest. See Storm at Land. At once the rushing Winds with roaring Sound Burst from th' Æolian Caves, and rend the Ground, With equal Rage their airy Quarrel try, And win by turns the Kingdom of the Sky: But with a thicker Night black Auster shrouds The Heav'ns, and drives on heaps the rolling Clouds: From whose dark Womb a rattling Tempest pours, Which the cold North congeals to haily Show'rs. From Pole to Pole the Thunder roars aloud, And broken Lightnings flash from ev'ry Cloud. Now smoaks with Show'rs the misty Mountain-Ground, And floated Fields lie undistinguish'd round: Th' Inachian Streams with headlong Fury run, And Erasinus rolls a Deluge on. Where late was Dust, now rapid Torrents play, Rush thro' the Mounds, and bear the Dams away: Old Limbs of Trees from crackling Forests torn, Are whirl'd in Air, and on the Winds are born. Frighted, he hears the bursting of the Sky, Sees yawning Rocks in massy Fragments fly, And views astonish'd from the Hill afar, The Floods descending and the watry War, That driv'n by Storms, and pouring o'er the Plain, Swept Herds, and Hinds, and Houses to the Main.— Pope. Stat. Theb. Lib. I. —As when a Storm to Land, By some tempestuous Constellation rais'd, Thro' the mid Ocean rolls: With sad Presage The Peasants shudder at the distant Noise, Foreboding Corn laid flat, and Trees o'erturn'd, And universal Ruin spread around: The Winds before it fly, and to the Shore Waft the hoarse Murmur.— Trap. Æn. Lib. XII. Thanks. O you, who only with Compassion see Troy's endless Toils, receive Us for Allies, And in this City yield a safe Retreat To Us, the Reliques of the Greeks, fatigu'd With all the Hazards of the Land, and Sea, Of all Things indigent: Due Thanks to pay Is not in Us, nor whatsoe'er remains Of Trojan Race dispers'd thro' all the World. The Gods to You (if Virtue be their Care, And any Justice yet remain) the Gods, And your own Mind self conscious of the Right, Equal Rewards shall give.— Trap. Æn. Lib. I. Your Favours great, and numerous, conferr'd On me, fair Queen, you justly may recount, Nor shall I once deny: nor e'er forget Eliza, while I'm mindful of my self: While Life inspires this Frame.— Id. Æn. Lib. IV. Bacchus, Quirinus, and the Sons of Jove, Whose Virtues rais'd them to the Gods above, Whilst here they liv'd, check'd War's destructive Rage, Built Towns, made Laws, and civiliz'd the Age; Complain'd that from the very Times they serv'd, They met far less Respect than they deserv'd.— Anon. alt. Hor. Lib. II. Epist. 1. Thirst. Now, wanting Water, every Place they try, And both the delving Spade and Sword employ: Earth's Bosom dark, laborious they explore, And search the Sources of her liquid Store. Deep in the hollow Hill the Well descends, Till level with the moister Plain it ends: Not lower down from chearful Day decline The pale Assyrians, in the golden Mine. In vain they toil, no secret Streams are found To roll their murm'ring Tides beneath the Ground: No bursting Springs repay the Workman's Stroke, Nor glitt'ring gush from out the wounded Rock: No sweating Caves in dewy Droppings stand, No slender Rills run gurgling o'er the Sand. Spent and exhausted with the fruitless Pain, The fainting Youth ascend to Earth again: And now, less patient of the Drought they grow, Than in those cooler Depths of Earth below. No sav'ry Viands crown the chearful Board, Ev'n Food for want of Water stands abhorr'd: To Hunger's meager Refuge they retreat, And since they cannot drink, refuse to eat. Where yielding Clods a moister Clay confess, With griping Hands the clammy Glebe they press: Where-e'er the standing Puddle loathsome lies, Thither in Crowds the thirsty Soldier flies: Horrid to Sight, the miry Filth they quaff'd, And drain'd, with dying Jaws, the deadly Draught. Some seek the beastial Mothers for Supply, And draw the Herds extended Udders dry: Till Thirst, unsated with the milky Store, With lab'ring Lips sucks in the putrid Gore. Some strip the Leaves, and suck the Morning Dews: Some grind the Bark, the woody Branches bruise, And squeeze the Sapling's unconcocted Juice.— With secret Flames their with'ring Entrails burn, And fiery Breathings from their Lungs return: The shrinking Veins contract their purple Flood, And urge, laborious, on the beating Blood: The heaving Sighs thro' straiter Passes blow, And scorch the painful Palate as they go: The parch'd rough Tongue Night's humid Vapour draws, And restless rolls within the clammy Jaws: With gaping Mouths they wait the falling Rain, And want those Floods that lately spread the Plain: Vainly to Heav'n they turn their longing Eyes, And fix 'em on the dry relentless Skies.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. IV. The Truce on equal Terms at length agreed, The Waters from the watchful Guard are freed. Eager to drink, down rush the thirsty Crowd, Hang o'er the Banks, and trouble all the Flood. Some, while too quick the fatal Draughts they drain, Forget the gasping Lungs that heave in vain: No breathing Air the choaking Channels fill, But ev'ry Spring of Life at once stands still. Some drink, nor yet the fervent Pest asswage, With wonted Fires their bloated Entrails rage: With bursting Sides each Bulk enormous heaves, While still for Drink th' insatiate Fever craves. At length returning Health dispers'd the Pain, And lusty Vigour strung the Nerves again.— Id. Ibid. Thunder and Lightning. See Cyclops. What Mind's unshaken? and what Soul not aw'd? And who not thinks the angry Gods abroad? Whose Limbs don't shrink, when dreadful Thunder hurl'd, Roars in the Clouds, and shakes the frighted World? What do not Cities, do not Nations fear, When dismal Desolation seems so near? Then do not Tyrant Kings, and haughty Lords, Repent their wicked Deeds, and boasting Words? Do they not tremble at approaching Doom, And fear their dreaded Punishment is come?— Creech alt. Lucret. Lib. V. —The dreadful Thunder roars aloud, When fighting Winds drive heavy Cloud on Cloud: For where the Heaven is clear, the Sky serene, No dreadful Thunder's heard, no Lightning seen, But where the Clouds are thick, there Thunders rise, Exert their Rage, and roar along the Skies.— Id. Lucret. Lib. VI. Quick Lightning flies, when heavy Clouds rush on, And strike, as Steel and Flint, or Stone and Stone: For then small Sparks appear, and scatter'd Light Breaks swiftly forth, and wakes the sleepy Night. The Flash first strikes the Eye, and then we hear The Clap, which does more slowly reach the Ear: For Light, and Images of Things, still fly More swift than Sound, and quicker strike the Eye.— Id. Ibid. Tides. As when the Ocean, with alternate Tide, Now rushes to the Beach, and o'er the Rocks Tosses the Waves, and to th' extreamest Sand Dashes it's curling Foam: Now refluent rolls With rapid Ebb, sucks back the ratling Stones, Flies from the Shelves, and naked leaves the Shore.— Trap. Æn. Lib. XI. Wash'd with successive Seas, the doubtful Strand By turns is Ocean, and by turns is Land. Whether the Winds in distant Regions blow, Moving the World of Waters to and fro: Or waining Moons their settled Periods keep To swell the Billows, and ferment the Deep; Or the tir'd Sun, his Vigour to supply, Raises the floating Mountains to the Sky, And slakes his Thirst within the mighty Tide, Do You who study Nature's Works decide: Whilst I the dark mysterious Cause admire, Nor, into what the Gods conceal, presumptuously enquire.— Addison. Lucan. Lib. I. Time. Time of itself is Nothing: but from Thought Receives it's Rise, by lab'ring Fancy wrought From Things consider'd; while we think on some As present, some as past, and some to come. For none can think of Time, must be confess'd, Without considering Things, in Motion, or at Rest.— Creech alter'd. Lucret. Lib. I. In all the World there's Nothing at a Stay: Like Shadows, Things appear, and pass away: Ev'n Time itself still hastens to be gone, Like some swift River always rolling on: The rapid Stream for ever forward flows; Time does the same, nor any Stoppage knows. As Waves urg'd on by Waves no Rest can find, Each driving that before, and drove by that behind; So Moments other Moments fast pursue, For ever changing, and for ever new: What's just now past we never more shall see, Nor what is present shall hereafter be, But new shall still succeed, thro' all Eternity.— Ovid. Met. Lib. XV. Time glides along with undiscover'd Haste, And mocks our Hopes: no Wings can fly so fast.— Ovid. Met. Lib. X. Time wears out all Things. See Change. Thy Teeth, devouring Time! thine, envious Age! On Things below still exercise your Rage: With venom'd Grinders you corrupt your Meat: And then, at lingring Meals, the Morsels eat.— Dryden. Ovid. Met. Lib. XV. Ev'n the hard Ploughshare Use will wear away, And stubborn Steel in length of Time decay: Water is soft, and marble hard, and yet, We see soft Water thro' hard Marble get.— Id. Ovid. Art. L. I. Nay more: 'tis certain, ev'ry circling Year, The Rings, which grace the Hands, diminish there: Drops hollow Stones; and while we plow, the Share Grows less: the Streets by often treading wear.— Creech. Lucret. Lib. I. Hard Stones, and Tow'rs, and Rocks, all feel the Rage Of pow'rful Time: ev'n Temples waste by Age: Nor can the Gods themselves prolong their Date, Change Nature's Laws, or be repriev'd from Fate: Ev'n Tombs grow old, and waste, by Years o'erthrown, Men's Graves before, but now become their own.— Id. Luc. L. V. Time changes all: and as with swiftest Wings He passes forward on, he quickly brings A diff'rent Face, a diff'rent State of Things. Nature still alters: this grows weak, this strong: This dies: this rises from it, firm and young.— Creech alt. Ibid. Time to be used. See Delay. Death to be remember'd. Opportunity. Ev'n now, in bloom of Youth, and Beauty's Prime, Beware of coming Age, nor waste your Time: Now, while You may, and rip'ning Years invite, Enjoy the seasonable, sweet Delight: For rolling Years, like stealing Waters, glide, Nor hope to stop their ever-ebbing Tide: Think not, hereafter will the Loss repay, For ev'ry Morrow will the Taste decay, And leave less Relish than the former Day. Congreve. Ovid. Art. III. The Snake his Skin, the Deer his Horns may cast, And both renew their Youth and Vigour past: But no Receipt can Humankind relieve, Doom'd to decrepid Age without Reprieve. Then crop the Flow'r which yet invites your Eye, And which, ungather'd, on it's Stalk must die.— Id. Ibid. The Flow'r of Youth decays and fades apace, (Of our short Being 'tis the shortest Space!) While the full Bowl with Pleasure circles round, While we're perfum'd, and with gay Garlands crown'd, While in the fair One's Arms entranc'd we lie, Old Age creeps on us, e'er we think it nigh.— Juv. Sat. IX. But if you wave your Hopes, and use Delays, You're wrong, for happy Youth apace decays. Alas, how swiftly flies away the Light! Nor slowly moves the Day, nor wheels the Night: How quickly fades the Earth, as Seasons slide, Losing it's flow'ry Grace, and purple Pride! How quickly does the tow'ring Poplar shed The leafy Honours of it's beauteous Head! Un-nerv'd by Age, how slothful lies the Horse, Which flew, when young, in the Olympic Course! I've known the Old desire their youthful Prime, And wail their foolish Hours and ill-spent Time. Ye cruel Gods! the Serpent can renew His speckl'd Lustre, and his shining Hue: But Beauty lost, our Art and Pow'r is vain, E'er to renew the precious Prize again.— Dart. Tibul. Lib. I. El. 4. He, free and merrily may live, can say, As the Day passes, I have liv'd to Day: And for to Morrow little do I care, Let the World's Ruler make it foul or fair.— Hor. Lib. III. Ode 29. Cut off long Cares from thy contracted Span, Nor stretch thy Hopes beyond the Reach of Man. Now, while we speak, Time, envious, hastes away: Trust not to morrow then, but seize the present Day.— Creech alt. Hor. Lib. I. Ode 11. Where the white Poplar and the lofty Pine Their friendly Branches inter-twine, And hospitable Shades compose: Where, near at Hand, a limpid River glides, In winding Streams, and gently chides The interrupting Pebbles as it flows: There drink thy gen'rous Wine, thy Odours shed, And short-liv'd Roses crown thy Head, While Fortune, Time, and Fate permit: For thou must soon resign thy Groves, thy House, Thy Farm where yellow Tyber flows, And all thy hoarded Wealth thy Heir shall get.— Hor. Lib. II. Ode 3. Tisiphone. See Furies. A hundred Snakes her gloomy Visage shade, A hundred Serpents guard her horrid Head: In her sunk Eyeballs dreadful Meteors glow: Such Rays from Phœbe's bloody Circle flow, When lab'ring with strong Charms, she shoots from high A fiery Gleam, and reddens all the Sky. Blood stain'd her Cheeks, and from her Mouth there came Blew steaming Poisons, and a Length of Flame. From ev'ry Blast of her contagious Breath, Famine and Drought proceed, and Plagues, and Death. A Robe obscene was o'er her Shoulders thrown, A Dress by Fates and Furies wore alone: She toss'd her meager Arms: her better Hand In waving Circles whirl'd a Fun'ral Brand: A Serpent from her left was seen to rear His flaming Crest, and lash the yielding Air.— Pope. Stat. Theb. Lib. I. A flaming Torch besmear'd with clotted Gore Tisiphone snatch'd up: then hurrying on Her crimson Robe, in streaming Blood deep'd dy'd, And girding round her Waist a twining Snake, Furious she issues forth.—Her close attend Lamenting Grief, and Fear, and shudd'ring Horror, And raving Rage with pale and trembling Looks. When she arriv'd at the Eolian Court, 'Tis said the Columns shook, the Ebon Gate Turn'd pale, and Phœbus in his Course shrunk back. Scar'd at these Omens, both the King and Queen Attempt to fly their Palace: but the Fiend Fills up the Entrance, and their Passage stops. Wide she her Arms extends writh'd round with Adders: And shakes her horrid Locks. The Snakes disturb'd, Russle, and Part a-down her Shoulders hang, Part curling round her Temples loudly hiss, Their Poison spew, and dart their quiv'ring Tongues.— Tomb. See Funeral. Manes. But good Æneas rear'd a stately Tomb, The Hero's Arms, his Oar, and Trumpet fix'd, Beneath a lofty Mountain: which from him Is now Misenus call'd, and keeps it's Name To everlasting Ages.— Trap. Æn. Lib. VI. There the vain Youth, who made the World his Prize, The prosp'rous Robber, Alexander lies. When pitying Death, at length, had freed Mankind, To sacred Rest his Bones were here consign'd: His Bones, that better had been toss'd and hurl'd, With just Contempt, around the injur'd World. Oh! should auspicious Years roll round again, And Godlike Liberty resume her Reign, Preserv'd to scorn, the Reliques would be shewn Of the bold Chief, whose boundless Pride alone This curst Example to Ambition gave, How many Realms one Mortal can enslave!— Rowe alt. Lucan. Lib. X. But know, proud Conqueror! thy Wrath, in vain, Strews with unbury'd Carcasses the Plain. What is it to thy Malice, if they burn, Rot in the Field, or moulder in the Urn? The Forms of Matter all, dissolving, die, And lost in Nature's blending Bosom lie. Tho' now thy Cruelty denies a Grave, These and the World one common Lot shall have: One last appointed Flame, by Fate's Decree, Shall waste yon azure Heav'ns, this Earth, and Sea: Shall knead the Dead up in one mingled Mass, Where Stars and They shall undistinguish'd pass. And tho' Thou scorn them now, yet Cæsar! know, High as thy own can soar, these Souls shall go: Or find, perhaps, a better Place below. Death is beyond thy Goddess Fortune's Pow'r, And Parent Earth receives what-e'er she bore. Nor will we mourn the Fate of those who lie Beneath the glorious Cov'ring of the Sky: That starry Arch for ever round 'em turns, A nobler Shelter far than Tombs or Urns.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. VII. Treachery. See Dissimulation. Oppos'd to Ilium lie the Thracian Plains, Where Polymester safe in Plenty reigns. King Priam to his Care commits his Son Young Polydore, the Chance of War to shun. A wise Precaution! had not Gold, consign'd For the Child's Use, debauch'd the Tyrant's Mind.

XIII. My cruel Fate, and Deiphobus, betrayed by Helen, whom he took to Wife after the Death of Paris. my more cruel Wife, To Grecian Swords betray'd my sleeping Life. You know in what delusive Joys we past The Night, that was by Heav'n decreed our last. For when the fatal Horse, descending down, Pregnant with Arms, o'er-whelm'd th' unhappy Town: She feign'd nocturnal Orgies, left my Bed, And, mix'd with Trojan Dames, the Dances led. Then waving high her Torch, the Signal made, Which rous'd the Grecians from their Ambuscade. With watching over-worn, with Cares opprest; Unhappy I had laid me down to Rest, And heavy Sleep my weary Limbs possess'd. Mean Time, my worthy Wife our Arms mislaid, And from beneath my Head my Sword convey'd: The Door unlock'd: and with repeated Calls, Invites her former Lord within my Walls. Thus in her Crime her Confidence she plac'd, And with new Treasons would redeem the past. What need I more: into the Room they ran, And basely murder'd a defenceless Man.— Dryden. Virg. Æn. Lib. VI. Pompey aproaching near the fatal Shore, Strikes the wide Sail, and plies the plunging Oar. Him, in a two-bank'd Boat, the Villains meet, And with dissembled Cheer the Roman greet. They feign their hospitable Land address'd With ready Friendship to receive her Guest. Excusing much an inconvenient Shore, Where Shoals lie thick, and meeting Currents roar: From his large Ship, unequal to the Place, They beg him to their lighter Boat to pass. Had not the Gods, unchangeably decreed, Devoted Pompey in that Hour should bleed, A thousand Signs the Danger near foretell, Seen by his sad presaging Friends too well. If fair and faithfully they had design'd, If Truth could lodge in an Egyptian Mind, Their King, himself, with all his Fleet had come, To lead, in Pomp, his Benefactor home. But thus Fate wills, and Pompey yields to Fate, Nor, at their Bidding, stay'd to hesitate: But left his Ship, and rather chose to bear Death, tho' 'twere certain, than ignoble Fear. His Wife, impatient, to be left behind, To rush, with him, into the Boat design'd: For now, his Danger only fill'd her Mind. But, Oh! forbear, (he cries,) my Love! forbear: Thou and my Son remain in Safety here: Let this old Head the Danger first explore, And prove the Faith of yon suspected Shore.— Rowe alt. Lucan. Lib. VIII. Just as he enter'd o'er the Vessel's Side, Hail General! the curs'd Septimius cry'd: A Roman once, and brave in Arms was He, Now of the Guard, and Slave to Ptolemy.— Id. alt. Defenceless, in the Boat, now, Pompey sat, Surrounded, and abandon'd to his Fate. Nor long they hold him, in their Power, aboard, E'er ev'ry Villain drew his ruthless Sword: The Chief perceiv'd their Purpose soon, and spread His Roman Gown, with Patience, o'er his Head: And when the curs'd Achillas pierc'd his Breast, His rising Indignation close repress'd. No Sighs, no Groans, his Dignity prophan'd, Nor Tears his still unsully'd Glory stain'd: Unmov'd, and firm, he fix'd him on his Seat, And dy'd, as when he liv'd and conquer'd, Great.— Id. Ibid. The bloody Business now compleatly done, New Furies urge the fierce Septimius on: He rends the Robe that veil'd the Hero's Head, And to full View expos'd the recent Dead: Hard in his horrid Gripe the Face he press'd, While yet the quiv'ring Muscles Life confess'd: He drew the dragging Body down with Haste, Then cross a Rower's Seat the Neck he plac'd: There, awkward, haggling, he divides the Bone, (The Headsman's Art was yet but little known.) Caught by the venerable Locks, which grow, In hoary Ringlets on his gen'rous Brow, To Egypt's impious King that Head they bear, Which Lawrels us'd to bind, and Monarchs fear.— Id. Ibid. Treason. See Treachery. The Hour was come, when Man's o'erlabour'd Breast Surceas'd its Care, by downy Sleep possess'd: All Things now hush'd, Scylla, in Love with Minos, who besieged her Father Nisus in his Capitol, cut off her Father's purple Hair, on which the Fate of his Kingdom depended, and fled away with it to his Enemy. Scylla with silent Tread, Urg'd her Approach to Nisus' royal Bed: There of the fatal Lock (accursed Theft!) She her unwitting Father's Head bereft. In safe Possession of her impious Prey, Out at a Postern Gate she takes her Way: Embolden'd by the Merit of the Deed, She traverses the adverse Camp with Speed, Till Minos' Tent she reach'd: The righteous King She thus bespoke, who shiver'd at the Thing. Behold th' Effect of Love's resistless Sway! I, Nisus' royal Seed, to Thee betray My Country, and my Gods.—For this strange Task, Minos, no other Boon but Thee I ask. This purple Hair, the Pledge of Love, receive, And with that Hair my Father's Life I give. Then off'ring to present the guilty Prize, Minos the Giver and the Gift denies. Shock'd at a Crime so new, he thus exclaim'd, With Mein indignant, and with Eyes inflam'd, Perdition seize Thee, Thou, thy Kind's Disgrace! May thy devoted Carcass find no Place In Earth, or Air, or Sea, by all outcast! Shall Minos with so foul a Monster blast His Cretan World, where cradled Jove was nurs'd? Forbid it Heav'n!—away, Thou most accurst!— Croxall alt. Ovid. Met. Lib. VIII. Trees. See Harmony. Place (Pleasant.) First, Trees by various Propagation grow: (So Nature has ordain'd: for some unforc'd By human Industry, spontaneous rise, In Fields abroad, and shade the winding Streams: As the soft Sallow, and the flexile Broom, The Poplar, and grey Willow. Some from Seed: The lofty Chesnut, and Jove's spreading Esculus, Supreme of Woods: and Oaks, by Greece esteem'd Oracular. A num'rous leafy Race Springs from the Roots of Others: as the Elm, And Cherry: Thus too sprouts the infant Bay (Parnassus-born, and by the Muses lov'd,) Beneath its Parent's more diffusive Shade. Virg. Georg. Lib. II. From Trunks the Olive, from the Arch the Vine More happy answers: From the solid Stock The Paphian Myrtle: From the Layer's Slip The hardy Hazle springs, and the tall Ash: The shady Tree which binds Alcides' Brows: Jove's Dodonæan Oak: the lofty Palm, And Pine for future Storms at Sea reserv'd.— Trap. Ibid. —Willows grow Near Rivers: Alders, in the marshy Lakes: Barren Wild-Ashes, on the rocky Hills: The Shores rejoyce in Myrtles: Bacchus loves The open Mountains: Eughs, the North, and Cold. Ibid. —By its proper Trees Each Country is distinguish'd. India sole Bears Ebony: Sabæa, Incence sweet. Media the happy Citron bears, of Juice Pungent, of Taste that dwells upon the Tongue: Than this no Aid more present (when, in Rage Of Jealousy, Step-Dames have Draughts infus'd, And mingled Herbs, and Incantations dire,) T' expel black Poysons from infected Limbs. Large is the Tree, and like a Lawrel grows: And, did it not a diff'rent Scent diffuse, A Lawrel it would be: no Winds its Leaves Unfix: Its Blossoms most tenacious grow: The Medes with this foment their Mouths, correct Their smelling Breath, and wheezing Sires relieve.— Trap.

Nor will the smooth-grain'd Lime, or Box disdain The rounding Chissel, or the hollowing Plane: Or the light Alder dread th'impetuous Tide, But lightly skim the Po, and on its Surges ride.— Id. Ibid.

What Words can paint those execrable Times, The Subject's Suff'rings, and the Tyrant's Crimes.! That Blood, those Murders, O, ye Gods, replace On his own Head, and on his impious Race! The Living and the Dead, at his Command, Were coupled, Face to Face, and Hand to Hand: Till choak'd with Stench, in loath'd Embraces ty'd, The ling'ring Wretches pin'd away, and dy'd. Thus plung'd in Ills, and meditating more, The People's Patience tir'd, no longer bore The raging Monster: But with Arms beset His House, and Vengeance, and Destruction threat. They fire his Palace: While the Flame ascends, They force his Guards: and execute his Friends. He cleaves the Crowd: and favour'd by the Night, To Turnus' friendly Court directs his Flight.— Dryden. Virg. Æn. Lib. VIII. A Sacrifice which pleases Jove much more Than all the Victims at his Altar slain, Is an unjust, oppressive Tyrant-King.— Senec. Herc. fur. Great Father of the Gods, when for our Crimes, Thou send'st some heavy Judgment on the Times: Some Tyrant-King, the Terror of his Age, The Type, and true Vicegerent of thy Rage: Thus punish him:—Set Virtue in his Sight, With all her Charms adorn'd, with all her Graces bright: But set her distant, make him pale to see His Gains out-weigh'd by lost Felicity. Sicilian Tortures, and the brazen Bull Are Emblems, rather than express the full Of what he feels: Yet what he fears is more.— Dryden. Pers. Sat. III. Down to the Grave, but seldom, sink in Peace Oppressive Kings, escaping Wounds and Murder: Tyrants but rarely die a bloodless Death— Juv. Sat. XVI. Void. But Matter does not fill up ev'ry Place: For besides that, there is an empty Space, A VOID.— A VOID is Space intangible: thus prov'd: For were there none, no Body could be mov'd: Because where-e'er the pressing Motion goes, It still must meet with Stops, still meet with Foes: 'Tis natural for Matter to oppose. So, that to move would be in vain to try, For motionless and stubborn all must lie: Because no yielding Body could be found, Which first should move, and give the other Ground. Tho' free from Pores, tho' Solid, Things appear, Yet many Reasons prove them to be rare. For Drops distil, and trickling Moisture creeps Thro' hardest Rocks, and ev'ry Marble weeps. Sounds pass thro' well clos'd Rooms and hardest Stones, And Winter's rig'rous Frost pervades our Bones: Which could not be, were there no empty Space, Thro' which the subtle Parts of Matter pass. Besides, why have not Bodies equal Weight With others, which in Bulk are but as great? Did the same Quantity of Matter frame Both Wool and Lead, their Weight must be the same. Since ev'ry Part of Matter downward tends, By Nature heavy: but no Void descends. Wherefore those lighter Things of equal Size, Do less of Matter, more of Void comprize.— Creech alt. Lucret. Lib. I. Variety. I would not always the same Odours prove, Nor satiate with one sort of Wine my Taste. From Mead, to Mead, the Bull delights to rove, And the wild Beast to vary his Repast. Ev'n Day itself would yield Us less Delight, But for the sweet Vicissitude of Night.— Addison junr. Petron. Arb. Vengeance Divine. See Pride.

Ovid. Met. Lib. VI. The blasphemous Propœtides deny'd To worship Venus, and her Pow'r defy'd: But soon that Pow'r they felt; the first that sold Their lewd Embraces to the World for Gold.

Her Taunts the Goddess with Resentment fill: My Face You like not, You shall try my Skill, She said; and strait her vengeful Bow she strung, And sent a Shaft that pierced her guilty Tongue: The bleeding Tongue in vain it's Accents tries; With the red Stream her Soul reluctant flies.— Croxall.

Thee, Goddess! Thee, the Clouds and Tempests fear, And at thy pleasing Presence disappear: For Thee the Land in fragrant Flow'rs is drest, For Thee the Ocean smiles, and smooths her wavy Breast, And Heav'n itself with more serene and purer Light is blest. For when the rising Spring adorns the Mead, And a new Scene of Nature stands display'd, When teeming Birds, and chearful Greens appear, And western Gales unlock the lazy Year, The joyous Birds thy Welcome first express, Whose native Songs thy genial Pow'r confess: Then savage Beasts bound o'er their slighted Food, Struck with thy Darts, and tempt the raging Flood. All Nature is thy Gift, Earth, Air, and Sea; Of All that breathes the various Progeny, Stung with Delight, is goaded on by Thee. O'er barren Mountains, o'er the flow'ry Plain, The leafy Forests, and the liquid Main, Extends thy uncontroul'd and boundless Reign. Thro' all the living Regions Thou dost move, And scatter'st, where Thou go'st, the kindly Seeds of Love.— Dryden. Lucret. Lib. I.

Well, art Thou really freed from Avarice? But what avails it, if some other Vice Be suffer'd to bear sway?—Say, art Thou free From Pride, and empty Popularity? Art free from raging Anger, and the Fear Of certain Death, that dreadful Messenger? Canst laugh at all the idle fond Conceits Of Sprights, Dreams, Omens, all those vulgar Cheats? Art thankful for thy Age that's past and gone? And being older art Thou wiser grown?

Impatient of a Yoke, the Name of Bride She shuns, and hates the Joys she never try'd. On Wilds, and Woods, she fixes her Desire, Nor knows what Youth, and kindly Love inspire. Her Father chides her oft: Thou ow'st, says he, A Husband to thy self, a Son to me. She, like a Crime, abhors the Nuptial Bed, She glows with Blushes, and she hangs her Head: Then casting round his Neck her tender Arms, Sooths him with Blandishments, and filial Charms Give me, my Lord, she said, to live, and die, A spotless Maid, without the Marriage Tye: 'Tis but a small Request: I beg no more Then what Diana's Father gave before. The good old Sire was soften'd to consent, But said, her Wish would prove her Punishment: For so much Youth and so much Beauty join'd, Oppos'd the State, which her Desires design'd.— Dryden. Ovid.

All cow'rdly Baseness Virtue does disdain, And bright it's Honours shine without a Stain: Nor does it mount or abdicate the Throne, As the wild Rabble chance to smile or frown.— Virtue to those unbars the Sky, Who merit Immortality, Scorning the clam'rous busy Crowd, She pants to try the arduous Road; Nor longer deigns on Earth to stay, But spreads her Wings, and soars away.— Hor.

With me the foremost Place let Honour gain, Fame and the Praises mingling in her Train: Gay Glory next, and Victory on high, White like myself, on snowy Wings shall fly.— Addison. Sib. Ital. Lib. III. Virtue conceal'd is but of little worth: For what of Good, in dark Obscurity Can it produce? A Boat without a Rower, A Lyre unplay'd on, or a Bow unstrung, It then resembles.—None, unless the Man That knows himself, and does his Passions quell, Can ever Virtue find: whose arduous Way Thro' tedious and perplexed Windings lies.— Claud. IV. Cons. Hon. Vision. See Ghost. Lo! in a Dream, before my slumb'ring Eyes The much afflicted Hector seem'd to stand, Profuse of Tears: dragg'd with the Chariot's Wheels As heretofore: besmear'd with bloody Dust: And thro' his swelling Feet transfix'd with Thongs. Ah me! how was he from that Hector chang'd, Who once return'd triumphant in the Spoils Of great Achilles: or who flung his Fire Among the Grecian Vessels! foul his Beard: His Hair all clung, and clotted with his Blood: And in his Body all the Wounds receiv'd Before his native Walls.— Fetching a dismal Groan;—Ah! fly, he cry'd; Fly, Goddess-born, and save Thee from these Flames: The Enemy has gain'd our Walls; and Troy Is tumbling from it's Height.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. II. 'Twas Night: and Sleep possess'd the weary World. Th' Effigies of our Trojan Country-Gods, Whom from amidst the Fire of ruin'd Troy I rescu'd, in my Sleep appear'd to stand Before my Eyes: discover'd by the Light, Where the full Moon profusely pour'd her Beams Thro' the inserted Windows.— Nor was it common Sleep: for plain I saw Their Looks, their Forms, and Fillets of their Hair.— Id. Virg. Æn. Lib. III. Æneas, in his lofty Ship, resolv'd Upon his Voyage, and prepar'd to sail, Securely slept.—To him the Form divine Returning, just the same in Mein, and Look, Appear'd in Dream:— Resembling Mercury in ev'ry Part, His Voice, Complexion, and his yellow Hair, And well proportion'd beauteous Limbs of Youth. Canst Thou in this Conjuncture, Goddess-born, Indulge thy Sleep? Nor think what Dangers round Inclose Thee, thoughtless Man?— Id. Virg. Æn. Lib. IV. — 'Twas Night; When Prince Æneas, on the Bank reclin'd, Beneath the open Canopy of Heaven, And troubled in his Breast with Woes of War, Late Rest indulg'd.—To him the local God, Old Tyberinus, from his pleasant Stream, Among the poplar Boughs, appear'd to rise: Thin azure Linnen o'er his Shoulders flew: And shady Reeds entwin'd his hoary Head.— Id. Virg. Æn. Lib. VIII. At length the weary Pompey. Chieftain sunk to Rest, And creeping Slumbers sooth'd his anxious Breast: When, lo! in that short Moment of Repose, His Julia, Cæsar's Daughter, was the first Wife of Pompey: soon after her Death, he marry'd Cornelia the Widow of Crassus, who was slain in the War against the Parthians. Julia's Shade, a dreadful Vision! rose: Thro' gaping Earth her ghastly Head she rear'd, And by the Light of livid Flames appear'd. These Civil Wars, she cry'd, my Peace infest, And drive me from the Mansions of the Blest: Elysium's happy Fields no more I know, Dragg'd to the guilty Stygian Shades below. When Thou wert mine, what Laurels crown'd thy Head! But Thou hast chang'd thy Fortune with thy Bed: In an ill Hour thy second Choice was made, To Slaughter Thou, like Crassus, art betray'd: Death is the Dower Cornelia's Love affords, Ruin still waits upon her potent Lords. While yet my Ashes glow'd, she took my Place, And came a Harlot to thy loose Embrace: But let her, Partner of thy Warfare go, Let her, by Land and Sea thy Labours know: In all thy broken Sleeps I will be near, In all thy Dreams sad Julia shall appear: Your Loves shall find no Moment for Delight, The Day shall all be Cæsar's, mine the Night. Not the dull Stream where long Oblivions roll, Could blot Thee out, my Husband, from my Soul. The Powers beneath my Constancy approve, And bid me follow wheresoe'er You rove. Amidst the joyning Battles will I stand, And still remind Thee of thy plighted Hand. Nor think those sacred Ties no more remain: The Sword of War divides the Knot in vain, That very War shall make Thee mine again. The Phantom spoke, and gliding from the Place, Deluded her astonish'd Lord's Embrace.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. III. At last, in solemn Silence of the Night, Proserpine.She rose before her slumb'ring Ceres. Mother's Sight: Her yellow Hair more bright than burnish'd Gold, All foul with Dirt, and squalid to behold: Pale are her beauteous Cheeks: her radiant Eyes Are dim'd with Night, and all their Lustre dies. Her ruddy Lips and snowy Limbs, the Soil Of Stygian Shades involves, and sooty Clouds defile. Scarce thro' the black Disguise the Parent knew The dismal Shape, and star'd with doubtful View: Art Thou, art Thou my Daughter?—Speak, declare: Or am I thus deceiv'd by empty Air?— Hughes. Claud.

Where fly'st Thou, (thus she vents her deep Distress) Why fly'st Thou her that crown'd Thee with Success? O Thou, beyond my Sire and Country priz'd! Where fly'st Thou, Cruel? Why am I despis'd? The Guilt and Merit of thy Spoil is mine, And can nor Gifts, nor Love, thy Soul incline? Can nothing move thee? can'st Thou throw off one Who has no Refuge left but Thee alone? Where shall I seek for Comfort? whither fly? My native Country does in Ashes lie: Or wer't not so, my Treason bars me there, And bids me wander: I myself have thrown From all the World, but Crete and Thee alone. Nor think, ungrateful Man! the liquid Way And foaming Billows shall inforce my Stay: I'll follow Thee in Spite: my Arms I'll throw Across thy Oars, or grasp thy crooked Prow, And drag thro' drenching Seas.— Croxall alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. VIII. And could'st thou hope, perfidious, to conceal So black a Crime? and silent leave my Coasts? Cannot my Love, nor thy once plighted Faith, Nor Dido's cruel, and untimely Death, (For Death inevitable must ensue) Detain Thee?—For thy Sake My Honour is extinguish'd, lost: and That By which alone I soar'd above the World, My once unsully'd Fame: to whom by Thee Dying am I abandon'd, cruel Guest? Since that's the only Name which now remains, Instead of Husband.— Nor art Thou of a Goddess Mother born: Nor is thy Birth from Dardanus deriv'd, Perfidious Wretch! but Caucasus, with Rocks Horrid, disclos'd thee from its flinty Sides, And fierce Hircanian Tygers gave thee suck. —Did he once give a Groan To see me weep? Did he once bend his Eyes? Or shed one Tear in Pity to my Love? True Faith is no where to be found: him toss'd On Shore, of all Things indigent, I here Receiv'd: and made him Partner of my Throne, (Fool that I was!) repair'd his shatter'd Fleet, And hospitably sav'd his Friends from Death. Furies distract me! now Apollo's Shrines, Now Lycian Oracles have warn'd him hence: Th' Ambassador of Heav'n, from mighty Jove Dispatch'd, brings dreadful Mandates thro' the Air. Belike the Gods are wond'rously concern'd For his Affairs: that Care disturbs their Rest. I nor detain Thee, nor refel thy Words: Away for Latium, by the Winds: go, seek Thy Kingdom o'er the Waves: for me, I hope, If the just Gods, have Pow'r, thou wilt receive Thy due Reward among the Rocks: and there Call oft on Dido: wrapt in dusky Flames, I'll follow Thee: and, soon as icy Death Has freed my Soul from Flesh, in ev'ry Place My Ghost shall haunt thee: Villain! thou shalt feel My Vengeance.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. IV. Want. Who taught the Parrot human Notes to try, Or with a Voice endu'd the chatt'ring Pye? 'Twas witty Want, fierce Hunger to appease: Want taught their Masters, and their Masters these. Let Gain, that gilded Bait, be hung on high, The hungry Witlings have it in their Eye: Pyes, Crows, and Daws, poetic Presents bring: You say they squeak, but they will swear they sing.— Dryd. Pers. Sat. I. Prologus. When human Reason Length of Time refin'd, And Want had set an Edge upon the Mind: When Men's Necessities did sorely press, And exercis'd their Wits to find Redress: Then various Cares their working Thoughts employ'd, And that which each invented all enjoy'd. Then Meanings first were fixt to barb'rous Sounds, Then Corn first grew, then Fruit enrich'd the Grounds: Thro' Seas unknown the Sailor then was hurl'd, And gainful Traffick joyn'd the distant World: Then Arts of War were found, and Arts of Peace.— Creech alt. Manil. I. 'Tis Luxury, the Bane of honest Minds, That dulls the Soul, and sharp Invention blinds: While more ingenious Want inspires the Man, To prove his Pow'r, and dare what-e'er he can. For daily Need to virtuous Arts will move, And Arts, invented, Practice will improve.— Hughes alt. Claud. Rapt. Pros. Lib. III. War. See Battle. Rout. Siege. Slaughter. War (Civil.) Who was it first began the dang'rous Trade, To work the Sword, and whet the shining Blade? How savage must he be to learn such Ill! And sure his very Soul itself was Steel. Then Wars began, then 'rose the murd'ring Trade, Then for fierce Death a shorter Way was made. But he, unthinking Wretch! no Harm design'd; We took the cursed Hint, to Ills inclin'd: And what he made to tame the savage Beast, We madly turn against each other's Breast. This Vice proceeds from greedy Thirst of Gold, For Wars and Tumults were unknown of old: When cheerful Draughts were quaff'd from common Wood, And beachen Bowls on homely Tables stood. No Need was then of Tow'rs their Wealth to keep, The Shepherd slept secure amidst his Sheep.— Dart. Tibul. Lib. X. El. 1. What Madness is it, in distracted Broils, To hasten on our Fate by martial Toils? Or Death provoke, by seeking high Renown? Uncall'd, with silent Pace, he comes, too soon.— Id. Ibid. —They Right and Wrong confound: From ev'ry Quarter impious Arms resound, And monstrous Crimes in ev'ry Shape are crown'd. The peaceful Peasant to the War is prest; The Fields lie fallow, in disgraceful Rest: The Plain no Pasture to the Flocks affords: The crooked Scythes are straiten'd into Swords. Perfidious Mars long plighted Leagues divides, And o'er the wasted World in Triumph rides.— Dryden. Virg. Georg. Lib. I. The peaceful Cities of th' Ausonian Shore, Lull'd in their Ease, and undisturb'd before, Are all on Fire: and some, with studious Care, Their restiff Steeds in sandy Fields prepare: Some their soft Limbs in painful Marches try, And War is all their Wish, and Arms the gen'ral Cry. Part scour the rusty Shields with Seam, and Part New grind the blunted Ax, and point the Dart. With Joy they view the waving Ensigns fly, And hear the Trumpet's Clangor pierce the Sky. Some hammer Helmets for the fighting Field, Some twine young Sallows to support the Shield. The Corslet some, and some the Cuisses mold, With Silver plated, and with ductile Gold. The rustic Honours of the Scythe and Share, Give Place to Swords and Plumes, the Pride of War. Old Faulchions are new temper'd in the Fires: The sounding Trumpet ev'ry Soul inspires. The Word is giv'n: with eager Haste they lace The shining Headpiece, and the Shield embrace. The neighing Steeds are to the Chariot ty'd, The trusty Weapon sits on ev'ry Side.— Dryden. Virg. Æn. VII. The high-born Nobles with the Vulgar fall: Wide wastes the Sword, and Slaughter reaches all: Murder ev'n Temples finds: distain'd with Gore, Slipp'ry with Carnage, is the sacred Floor. No Age is spar'd: low-bending to the Grave, Life's small Remains the Ancient cannot save: Infants, new-born, and reeking from the Womb, The plunging Steel sends hasty to the Tomb. What can such Infants do to merit Death? 'Tis a sufficient Crime that they have Breath.— Lucan. Lib. I. —Horrid War invents New Methods, and a thousand Forms of Death: War gluts the Earth, and dyes the Seas with Blood. Then Wickedness broke loose, ranges at Will Thro' ev'ry Place, nor House, nor Temple 'scapes. No Crime is uncommitted.— Senec. Hipp. The Indian Tiger a perpetual Peace With Tigers keeps, and Bears with Bears agree: But Man, with hellish Art, the murd'ring Sword 'Gainst his own Race prepares.— Juv. Sat. XV. War Declar'd. Two Gates of War there stand (so call'd their Name) Tremendously Religious, by the Dread Of horrid Mars: an hundred brazen Bolts, And everlasting Iron's solid Strength Secures them: Nor does Janus ever cease To guard the Portal. Here, when certain War The Fathers by their Sentence have decreed, The Consul clad in his Quirinal Gown, And rich Gabinian Robe, himself unlocks The jarring Doors: Himself calls forth the Fight: Then all the Forces follow: And at once In shrill Assent the brazen Trumpets sound. Trap. Æn. Lib. VII. War (Civil.) See Discord. Lo! from the Earth the mild and gentle Train Of Deities departs, and leaves Mankind To sure and dreadful Desolation doom'd. Peace leads the Way, and beats her snowy Arms, Within her Helmet hides her vanquish'd Head, And flies affrighted to th' Elysian Shades. On her inviolable Faith attends, And mournful Justice with dishevel'd Hair, And Concord wailing, with her Garments torn. But Hell, with Joy, unbolts it's brazen Doors, And all it's Furies quit the Stygian Court: Threat'ning Bellona with Erynnis joyns, And dire Megæra arm'd with flaming Brands. Pale Death, insidious Fraud, and Massacre, With Rage burst forth, who, from his Fetters freed, Lifts high his gory Head: a Helmet hides His Visage scarr'd with Wounds: his left Hand grasps The Shield of Mars, horrid with countless Darts, Whilst in his Right a flaming Torch appears, To light Destruction, and to fire the World.— Petron. Arb. Their ancient Friends, as now they nearer drew, Prepar'd for Fight the wond'ring Soldiers knew: Brother with Brother in unnat'ral Strife, And the Son arm'd against the Father's Life. Curst Civil-War! then Conscience first was felt, And the tough Veteran's Heart began to melt. Pity awhile their Hands from Slaughter kept, Inward they groan'd, and as they drew, they wept: But ev'ry Blow their wav'ring Rage assures, In Murder hardens, and to Blood inures. Crowds charge on Crowds, nor Friends their Friends descry, But Sires by Sons, and Sons by Fathers die.— Addison. Lucan. Lib. IV. Dissembled Hate and Rancour rang'd at Will: All, as they pleas'd, took Liberty to kill: And while Revenge no longer fear'd the Laws, Each private Murder was the public Cause. The Leader bad destroy: and, at the Word, The Master fell beneath the Servant's Sword. Brothers on Brothers were for Gifts bestow'd, And Sons contended for their Father's Blood. For Refuge some to Caves and Forests fled: Some to the lonely Mansions of the Dead: Some, to prevent the cruel Victor, die: These strangled hang from fatal Beams on high: While those, from Tops of lofty Turrets thrown, Came headlong on the dashing Pavement down.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. II. Now either Host the middle Plain had pass'd, And Front to Front in threat'ning Ranks were plac'd: Then ev'ry well known Feature stood to View, Brothers their Brothers, Sons their Fathers knew. Then first they feel the Curse of Civil Hate, Mark where their Mischiefs are assign'd by Fate, And see from whom themselves Destruction wait. Stupid a-while, and at a Gaze they stood, While creeping Horror froze the lazy Blood: Some small Remains of Piety withstand, And stop the Javelin in the lifted Hand: Remorse for one short Moment step'd between, And motionless, as Statues, all were seen.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. VII. Forbear such Wars, my Children, O forbear! Nor sheath your dreaded Country's conqu'ring Swords Within your Country's Bowels.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. VI. These ruin'd Monuments are not defac'd By all-destroying Time: that We behold So many Cities, desolate, and waste, Is owing to the Guilt of Civil War. To what small Number now has that reduc'd Mankind! not all our Offspring can suffice To fill the Towns, or cultivate the Lands.— Luc. L. VII. Warrior. See Hero. When Turnus saw Æneas from the Field Retiring, and the Trojan Chiefs confus'd: Fir'd with new Hope, he suddenly demands His Arms, and Horses: vaults with haughty Bound Into his Car, and guides the flowing Reins. Many brave Warriors in his swift Career He gives to Death: rolls many on the Ground Half dead: or drives his Chariot o'er their Troops; Or plies their Backs with Jav'lins in their Flight. As when, enrag'd, near frozen Hebrus' Stream, Mars clashes on his Shield, and wakes the War, And to his foaming Coursers gives the Reins: They, in the open Field, outfly the Winds, Notus, and Zephyrus: beneath their Feet The Thracian Confines groan: and round him throng Fury, and Stratagem, and pale Dismay, The dire Retinue of th' ensanguin'd God. So Turnus, thro' the Middle of the Fight, Exulting, lashes on his fiery Steeds Smoking with Sweat: and (dreadful to behold!) Tramples his prostrate Foes: the rapid Hoofs Scatter the gory Dew all sprinkled round, And spurn thick Clots of mingled Sand and Blood.— Trap. Æn. Lib. XII. And now the Courser on his Back receives Th' accustom'd Load: He settles in the Seat, And both his Hands with pointed Jav'lins fills: His brazen Helmet glitters on his Head, And nods the waving Crest of Horses Mane. Thus arm'd, with rapid Haste into the Midst Furious he rides: Within his Bosom boils Disdainful Shame, and Grief to Madness wrought, And Love inflam'd with Rage, and conscious Worth.— Id. Æn. Lib. X. But by Jove's Impulse fierce Mezentius fir'd Mean while succeeds to Battle, and invades The conqu'ring Trojans. All the Tyrrhene Bands Assemble: Him alone with mortal Hate United, and with Storms of Darts they press.

E'er Winds arise:—Or, Signs of Wind. swells the working Flood: Or, a harsh Crash is heard throughout the Wood: Or, mingling, sound the Coasts from distant Seas, And gathering Murmur rustles in the Trees. Then scarce the Wave from bended Skiffs abstains, When Cormorants forsake the watry Plains, And scream along the Shore: when swift to Land The Sea-gulls haste, and sport along the Strand: Or, when the Hern prepares his lofty Flight, Quits the known Marsh, and mounts th' Etherial Height. Oft too, you'll see, when furious Winds impend, Precipitate, the Stars from Heav'n descend; And far behind, thro' gloomy Shades of Night, Glitter, and whiten the long Trails of Light: Oft whirl in Air dry Straw, and with'ring Leaves, And Feathers wanton on the simm'ring Waves. But from the North when flashing Signs of Rain. Lightnings fly, And East, and Westward, Thunder rends the Sky: Then with the swelling Dykes swims all the Plain: Then ev'ry Seaman, on the foaming Main, Quick gathers up the Sails all drench'd with Rain. None, uninform'd, e'er did the Show'r assail: Cranes, as it rose, flew downwards to the Vale: Or, gazing on the Heavens stood the Steer, And with wide Nostrils snuff'd the humid Air: Or, Swallows, chatt'ring, round the Lake have flown, And miry Frogs sung out their antient Moan. And oftner has the Ant with busy Tread, Up from the Nether-Cells her Eggs convey'd: Deep drank the mighty Bow: and foodless rose Loud, with their rustling Wings, a Host of Crows. Now may you see wide Ocean's various Fowls, And those that haunt Cayster's well-lov'd Pools, In wanton Strife the Silver-Flood divide, And lave their Shoulders with the sparkling Tide: Now with their downy Breasts the Torrent stem: Now plunge their Heads: now run upon the Stream: With endless Labour ply the watry Plain, And dive, and wash, and proudly wash in vain. Then, with full Voice the Rook the Show'r demands, And solitary stalks along the thirsty Sands. Nor is unskilful of impending Storms The Virgin, nightly, that her Task performs: When sparkling in the Lamp the Oyl she sees, And fungous Balls around the Wick increase. Nor from less certain Signs mayst Thou descry Unshowery Suns, and an Signs of Fair Weather. expanded Sky. Then keen the Stars appear: nor, rising, seems The Moon a Debtor to her Brother's Beams: Then do the wafting Winds no longer bear The fleecy Flakes; serene and still the Air: Nor to the tepid Sun their Wings expand, The Sea-lov'd Halcyons, basking on the Strand: Nor mindful are the Swine, with Jaws display'd, To gripe the Straw, and toss their rustling Bed: But downwards glides the Mist, and lodges on the Mead: And Owls, still waiting on the Sun's Retreat, In vain their Midnight Songs aloft repeat. Then, thrice, or four times, firmly prest the Throat, The Rooks redouble every clearer Note: Gay, with I know not what unusual Joys, They crowd the Trees, and chatt'ring is their Noise. What dear Delight possesses every Breast, When each beholds, soon as the Storms are ceas'd, Her tender Young once more, and pleasing Nest. Not that I think the Gods to them dispense Of Things in Fate a more discerning Sense: But when the Storm, and moist inconstant Skies Alternate Change: when southern Tempests rise, Condense what's thin, and what's condens'd more rare By Warmth becomes, they vary with the Air: Now one Impression in their Bosoms dwells, Another when the Wind the Clouds dispels: Hence from the Birds that warbling Concert flows: Hence Herds exult, and hoarsely shout the Crows. But to the rapid Sun if You attend, And how the Moons their following Courses bend, You'll ne'er be taken by th' ensuing Day, Nor shall fair Nights, insiduous, Thee betray. When first the Signs from the Moon. Moon collects the coming Rays, If she thick Air in her dark Horn displays, Vast Show'rs invade the Peasant and the Seas: But if a Virgin Blush her Face o'er-spread, Winds blow:—with Wind still Phœbe's Cheeks are red: But at her fourth Ascent if pointed rise The silver Horns, and bright she trips the Skies, That Day entire, and all it's following Race, Till fully, she compleats her monthly Space, (Safe by this Sign) nor Storms shall know, nor Rain: And Sailors; rescu'd from the boist'rous Main, Their promis'd Vows shall pay to all the watry Reign. And thus the Sun, as Rising he appears, Or dipt in Ocean, various Signs declares: Unerring Signs his circling Course attend, Or in the Morn, or when the Stars ascend. Whene'er Signs from the Sun. he mottles o'er his new-born Light, Or masks in Clouds, or half retires from Sight, Suspect the Show'r: For, fatal to the Sown, And Trees, and Herds, the South comes pouring down. If, at the purple Dawn, his struggling Rays Strike thro' the thick'ning Skies a scatter'd Blaze: If, o'er her Cheeks a livid Paleness shed, Aurora springs from Tithon's saffron Bed: Ah! what can Leaves to guard the Grapes avail? So rattling bounds on Roofs the horrid Hail! But, from Olympus, just as he slides down, 'Twould profit more to have observ'd the Sun. Oft o'er his Face are diff'rent Colours spread: Thick Rains the Azure, Winds denote the Red: But intermingled if the Spots appear With shining Flame, then Winds and Clouds prepare With equal Rage, an universal War: That Night let none to venture on the Sea, Or to untie the Cable, counsel me. But if his Orb all lucid shines, and gay, When forth he leads, and when he hides the Day, Fear not the Storm: You'll see the northern Breeze Slide thro' the Grove, and gently move the Trees. Lastly, to what the Ev'ning is inclin'd, From whence shall come the Cloud-dispelling Wind, And of the humid South the secret Mind, The Sun to You repeated Tokens gives: And who dares say that e'er the Sun deceives?— Anon.

Now both, their Mantles button'd to their Breast, Their dextrous Fingers ply with eager Haste, And work with Pleasure: while they chear the Eye With glowing Purple of the Tyrian Dye: Or, justly intermixing Shades with Light, Insensibly their Colourings unite. As when a Shower transpierc'd with sunny Rays, It's mighty Arch along the Heav'ns displays, From whence a thousand diff'rent Colours rise, Whose fine Transition cheats the clearest Eyes, So like the intermingled Shading seems, And only differs in the last Extreams.

Hortensius dying, she was again married to Cato her first Husband, at the time when the Civil War was just broke out between Cæsar and Pompey. The Concern Cato felt for the Commonwealth, made him lay aside all the Ceremonies usual at the Roman Weddings. his Faith he plights, And calls the Gods to view the lonely Rites. No Garlands gay the cheerful Portal crown'd, Nor wooly Fillets wove the Posts around: No genial Bed, with rich Embroidery grac'd, On Iv'ry Steps in lofty State was plac'd: No Hymeneal Torch preceeding shone, No Matron put the tow'ry Frontlet on, Nor bad her Feet the sacred Threshold shun. No yellow Veil was loosely thrown to hide The rising Blushes of the trembling Bride: No glitt'ring Zone her flowing Garments bound, Nor sparkling Gems her Neck encompass'd round: No silken Scarf, nor decent winding Lawn, Was o'er her naked Arms and Shoulders drawn: But, as she was, in Funeral Attire, With all the Sadness Sorrow could inspire, With Eyes dejected, with a joyless Face, She met her Husband's, like a Son's Embrace.— Rowe.

Another doubts: but as his Doubts decline, He dreads just Vengeance, and he starts at Sin: He owns a God: and yet the Wretch forswears: And thus he reasons to relieve his Fears. Let Isis rage, so I securely hold The Coin forsworn, and keep the ravish'd Gold. Let Blindness, Lameness come: are Legs and Eyes Of equal Value to so great a Prize? The Vengeance of the Gods, tho' sure, is slow: If, therefore, all must feel the dreadful Blow Their Crimes deserve, so busy they must be, 'Twill be an Age before they come to me. But they are wont to pardon and to spare, And I too, may, perhaps, their Mercy share. Oft, Sins alike, unlike Rewards have found, One Villain's crucify'd, another crown'd. The Man that shiver'd on the Brink of Sin, Thus steel'd, and hard'ned, ventures boldly in. Creech alt. Juv. Sat. XIII. He that once Sins, like him that slides on Ice, Goes swiftly down the slippery Ways of Vice: Tho' Conscience checks him, yet, those Rubs gone o'er He slides on smoothly, and looks back no more. What Sinners finish where they first begin, And with one Crime content their Lust to sin? Nature, that rude, and in her first Essay, Stood boggling at the Roughness of the Way, Us'd to the Road, unknowing to return, Goes boldly on, and loves the Path when worn. Ibid. What Day's so sacred, but it's Rest's profan'd By violent Robbers, or by Murder stain'd? Here hir'd Assassins for their Gain invade, And treach'rous Poys'ners urge their fatal Trade.

Look o'er the World, see Force and Fraud increase, Rapine in War, and Treachery in Peace: But look for Truth and Faith, the Search is vain! No Mind is honest, and no Thoughts are plain. What bulky Villanies bestride the Age! What Envy pushes on Mankind to Rage! Envy not to be dispossess'd, her Throne Is firmly fixt, and all the World's her own. For cursed Gold is all the mighty Strife: Sons sell their Father's and their Mother's Life, Friends kill their Friends: and at the barb'rous Sight The Sun retires, and leaves the World to Night. While Brothers poison with a smiling Face, And mix the Cup, and kill where they embrace: No Place is safe, no Temple yields Defence, 'Gainst secret Stabs, or open Violence. Those most betray who Kindness most pretend, And Crowds of Villains skulk behind the Name of Friend. The World's infected, Wrong and Fraud prevail, While Truth, and Honesty, and Justice fail: Nay, Laws support those Crimes they check'd before, And Executions now affright no more.— Creech. Manil. Lib. II. Wife. See Portion. A Country Girl, scarce to a Curt'sy bred, Than Thee, Mother to the Gracchi, and Daughter of Scipio Africanus, who conquered Hannibal and Syphax. Cornelia, rather would I wed: If supercilious, haughty, proud, and vain, Thou bring'st thy Father's Triumphs in thy Train. Take hence thy boasted Hannibal, I pray, Nor let behind him vanquish'd Syphax stay; With all thy Carthaginian State pack up, and march away.— Dryd. alt. Juv. Sat. VI. What Beauty or what Chastity can bear So great a Price? if stately and severe She still insults, and you must still adore, Grant that the Honey's much, the Gall is more: Upbraided with the Virtues she displays, Sev'n Hours in twelve you loath the Wife you praise.— Dryd. Ibid. Besides, what endless Brawls by Wives are bred! The Curtain Lecture makes a restless Bed. Then, when she has Thee sure within the Sheets, Worse than a Tyger robb'd,— She roars, and tares, and all her Arts repeats. Conscious of Crimes herself, she teizes first: Thy Servants are accus'd, thy Whore is curs'd: She acts the Jealous, and at Will she cries, For Women's Tears are but the Sweat of Eyes. Poor Cuckold Fool! Thou think'st her Love sincere, And suck'st between her Lips the falling Tear: But search her Cabinet, and thou shalt find Each Tiller there, with Love Epistles lin'd. Suppose her taken in a close Embrace: This you would think so manifest a Case, No Rhet'ric could defend, no Impudence outface: And yet ev'n then, she cries,—the Marriage Vow A mental Reservation must allow: And there's a silent Bargain still imply'd, The Parties should be pleas'd on either Side: And both may for their private Ends provide.— Id. Ibid. The gaudy Gossip, when she's set a-gog, In Jewels drest, and at each Ear a Bob, Goes flaunting forth, and in her Trim of Pride, Thinks all she says or does, is justify'd. When poor, she's scarce a tolerable Evil: But rich, and fine, a Wife's a very Devil. Mean-while the Husband's whole Estate is spent; He may go bare, while she receives his Rent. She minds him not: She lives not as a Wife, But like a bawling Neighbour, full of Strife: Near him, in this alone, that she extends Her Hate to all his Servants and his Friends.— Dryden. Juv. Sat. VI. But of all Plagues the greatest is untold: The Book-learn'd Wife, in Greek and Latin bold. The Critic-Dame, who at her Table sits, Homer and Virgil quotes, and weighs their Wits; And pities Dido's agonizing Fits. She has so far th' Ascendant of the Board, The prating Pedant puts not in one Word: The Man of Law is non-plus'd in his Suit; Nay, ev'ry other female Tongue is mute. Hammers, and beating Anvils, you would swear, And Vulcan with his whole Militia there. Tabors and Trumpets cease: for she alone Is able to redeem the lab'ring Moon. Ev'n Wit's a Burden, when it talks too long: But she who has no Continence of Tongue, Should walk in Breeches, and should wear a Beard, And mix among the Philosophic Herd. O what a midnight Curse has he, whose Side Is pester'd with a Mood and Figure Bride! Let mine, Ye Gods! (if such must be my Fate) No Logic learn, nor History translate! But rather be a quiet humble Fool: I hate a Wife to whom I go to School: Who climbs the Grammar Tree, distinctly knows Where Noun, and Verb, and Participle grows: Corrects her Country Neighbour; and in Bed, For breaking Priscian's, breaks her Husband's Head.— Id. Ibid. It is not from the Gods, or Cupid's Dart, That many a homely Woman wins the Heart: A Wife well-humour'd, dutiful, and chaste, And clean, will hold her wand'ring Husband fast: Such are the Links of Love, and such a Love will last.— Creech alter'd. Lucret. Lib. IV. In good Faith, we poor Wives have got a very ill Name with our Husbands: and because there are a few bad ones, the World judges hardly of us all.— Eachard. Terent. Hecyr. Will. Whence comes this perfect Freedom of the Mind? Whence comes the WILL so free and unconfin'd, Above the Pow'r of Fate? by which we go Where-e'er we please, and what we Will we do?— Creech. Lucret. Lib. II. A knavish Spartan was to Cheat inclin'd, But wanted first to know Apollo's Mind; Whether, if he with sacred Oaths deny'd A trusted Pledge, Heav'n would be satisfy'd. The Priestess answer'd, that his base Intent Should not escape without a Punishment. Startled at this, the Wretch gave up the Trust; And was, thro' Fear, not Inclination, just. Yet Plagues pursu'd him, and the mental Sin Destroy'd himself, his Children, and his Kin. Thus did he suffer for his wicked Will, Tho' he ne'er practic'd the intended Ill. One would think Juvenal had read what Christ himself says Matt. v. 27, 28. Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit Adultery. But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a Woman to lust after her, hath committed Adultery with her already in his Heart.That Man stands really guilty of the Fault, Who in his Breast admits a wicked Thought: Then what sad Punishment must He expect, Who thinks a Crime, and brings it to effect?— Juv. Sat. XIII. 'Tis worthy Praise, a good Intent to shew, When that is all We have a Pow'r to do: The Gods excuse what-e'er is wanting more, If with a willing Mind we them adore: And not less pleas'd the poor Man's Lamb receive, Than Bullocks which the Rich and Mighty give.— Ovid. Pont. Lib. IV. Wine. See Bacchus. Osiris. Wine warms the Blood, and makes the Spirits flow, Care fly, and Wrinkles from the Forehead go: Exalts the Poor: invigorates the Weak: Gives Mirth, and Laughter, and a rosy Cheek: Bold Truths it speaks: and spoken, dares maintain: And brings our old Simplicity again. Wine makes the Youth the fair One's Charms admire: And Love with Wine is Fire put to Fire.— Dryd. alt. Ov. Art. Am. I. Would you that I my Thoughts on Wine declare? Short my Advice, and few my Precepts are. Wine drank discreetly warms the Heart to Love, But Drunkenness does its Destruction prove: A gentle Breeze of Wind blows up the Fire, Whose rising Flames would in a Storm expire.— Ov. Rem. Am. Wine kept, they say, old Cato's Virtue warm; Wine whets the Dull, and Wit inspires, The Grave with sprightly Vigour fires, And, by a never-failing Charm, Unlocks the Mind, and all its gay Desires. Wine with fresh Hope the Coward cheers, Revives the Wretched and Undone, And makes the Slave his Lord disown: What Wretch, when arm'd by Bacchus, fears To meet a Warrior's Arm, or stand a Tyrant's Frown?— Creech. Hor. Lib. III. Od. 21. What Wonders cannot Wine effect? 'Tis free Of Secrets, and turns Hope to Certainty. The unarm'd Man it renders brave in War, And rids the troubled Mind of all its Care. It teaches Arts, it teaches how to think; And what Man is not eloquent in Drink? Or who's so much deprest by Poverty, That Wine can't make him happy, rich, and free?— Creech alt. Hor. Lib. I. Epist. 5. Winds. See Storm at Land. Storm at Sea. Tempest. Nor the Creator left the Winds at large, On Seas, and Shores, their Fury to discharge: Bound as they are, and circumscrib'd in Place, They rend the World, resistless, where they pass: And mighty Marks of Mischief leave behind: Such is the Rage of their tempestuous Kind. First, Eurus to the rising Morn is sent, (The Regions of the balmy Continent:) And Eastern Realms where early Persians run, To greet the blest Appearance of the Sun. Westward, the wanton Zephyr wings his Flight, Pleas'd with the Remnants of departing Light. Fierce Boreas, with his Offspring, issues forth, T'invade the frozen Waggon of the North: Whilst frowning Auster seeks the Southern Sphere, And rots, with endless Rain, th' unwholsome Year.— Dryd. Ovid. Met. Lib. I. —In his capacious Cave, Great Æolus, with absolute Command, Controuls, imprisons, and confines in Chains The noisy Tempests, and reluctant Winds. They roar, and murmur round the Mountain's Sides, Indignant: Æolus his Scepter shakes, Majestic on his lofty Throne: o'er-rules Their wild Desires, and moderates their Rage. Which did he not, with rapid Force they'd hurl Heav'n, Earth, and Seas, and sweep them thro' the Air. But fearing This, the Sov'reign of the Gods Pent them in gloomy Caves: and o'er them threw Vast Piles of massy Rocks:—impos'd a King, Who should, by certain Measures, know to curb, Or, when commanded, to indulge their Rage.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. I. East, West, and North, and South, on either Side, Oppos'd they lie, and thus the World divide: As many Winds from these four Quarters fly, And fight, and rattle, thro' the empty Sky. Rough Boreas, from the North bears Frost and Snows: And from the East the surly Eurus blows: Wet Auster from the torrid South is thrown: And pleasing Zephyrus loves the setting Sun.— Creech. Manil. Lib. IV. Like Boreas in his Race, when rushing forth, He sweeps the Skies, and clears the cloudy North: The waving Harvest bends beneath his Blast: The Forest shakes, the Groves their Honours cast: Aloft he flies, and with impetuous Roar, Pursues the foaming Surges to the Shore.— Dryden. Virg. Georg. Lib. III. Now rising all at once, and unconfin'd, From ev'ry Quarter roars the rushing Wind. First, from the wide Atlantic Ocean's Bed, Tempestuous Corus rears his dreadful Head: Th' obedient Deep his potent Breath controuls, And, Mountain-high, the foamy Flood he rolls. Him the North-East encount'ring fierce defy'd, And back rebuffeted the yielding Tide. The curling Surges loud conflicting meet, Dash their proud Heads, and bellow as they beat: While piercing Boreas from the Scythian Strand Plows up the Waves, and scoops the lowest Sand. Nor Eurus, then, I ween, was left to dwell, Nor show'ry Notus, in th' Æolian Cell: But each, from ev'ry Side, his Pow'r to boast, Rang'd his proud Forces, to defend his Coast. Equal in Might, alike they strive in vain, While in the midst the Seas unmov'd remain.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. V. Winter. See Frost. Seasons. Year. Still slothful proves the Winter to the Swain. 'Tis then their Stores the Peasants oft employ In mutual Feasts, and give a loose to Joy: The genial Winter all their Minds prepares To sprightly Mirth, and buries anxious Cares: So joy the Sailors, every Danger past, Safe in the Port the Ship, and crown'd the Mast.— Anon. Virg. Geor. Lib. I. The Fields unwrought then lie, unplow'd the Seas, And Mars in Quarters, lies consign'd to Ease: Rocks cleave with Frosts: and by the Cold opprest, All Nature's Powers are stiffen'd into Rest.— Creech. Man. Lib. III. Mean while the Sun rolls round the circling Year, And icy Winter, harsh with northern Winds, Roughens the Sea.— Trap, Virg. Æn. Lib. III. —Then is the time to set Springs for Cranes, and Toils for Stags: to hunt The Hare: and from the Balearian sling, With twisted Thong whirl'd round, to shoot the Doe: While Snow lies deep: while heavy Cakes of Ice, Push'd by the Tide, down the dull River float.— Id. Georg. Lib. I. Scythian Winter. In Scythia's Realms, no Herbage on the Fields, No Leaves, in Winter, on the Trees are seen: But Frost, and Ice, and ridgy Heaps of Snow, Sev'n Ells in Height, deform the Country round. Eternal Winter reigns, and freezing Winds. The Sun ne'er dissipates the hazy Gloom: Not when his Steeds mount upwards to the Sky, Nor when He washes in the Ocean's Waves, Red with his Beams, his prone descending Car. The running Streams to sudden Crusts congeal: The Water on it's Surface Iron Wheels Sustains: and Carts are driv'n, where Lighters sail'd. Brass splits: Their rusling Garments stiffen frore: With Axes Wine is hewn: To solid Glass The standing Puddles in the Dykes are turn'd: And Icicles hang rigid from their Beards. Nor less, meanwhile, it Snows o'er all the Air: The Cattle die: The Neat, of bulky Size, With Frost surrounded stand: The Stags in Droves, Benumb'd beneath th' unusual Weight, scarce raise Their Heads, or with their topmost Horns appear. These the rough Hunters nor with Dogs, nor Toils, Nor with the Line of crimson Plumes pursue: But, as in vain they labour with their Breasts, And push against th' opposing Hills of Snow, Stab them with Swords, or Spears, in closer Fight, Braying aloud: And, with a mighty Shout, Triumphant, carry off the bleeding Prey. Themselves in low sunk Caverns, under Ground, Secure, and jovial live: whole Oaks, and Elms, Roll to the Hearths, and pile them on the Fire: In Mirth and Jollity protract the Night; And Beer, and Cyder quaff, instead of Wine. Such is th' unbroken Race of Men, who live Beneath the Pole: by rough Riphæan Blasts For ever buffeted: and with the Skins And tawny Furs of Beasts their Bodies cloth.— Trap. Virg. Geor. Lib. III. Such are the Climes beneath the frozen Zone, Where chearless Winter plants her dreary Throne: No golden Stars their gloomy Heav'ns adorn, Nor genial Seasons to their Earth return: But everlasting Ice and Snows appear, Chill all the Summer's Fires, and curse the barren Year.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. IV. Wish. See Midas. Prayers. Me may the Muses, whose vow'd Priest I am, Smit with strong Passion for their sacred Song, Dear above all to me, accept: and teach The heav'nly Roads, the Motions of the Stars, The Sun's Defects, the Labours of the Moon: Whence Tremor to the Earth: by what Impulse The Sea swells high, and ebbing back retires: Why Suns in Winter haste so swift to tinge Themselves in Ocean: and what Cause retards The sluggish Nights.—But if the colder Blood About my Heart forbid me to approach So near to Nature: may the rural Fields, And Streams, which murm'ring glide along the Vales, Delight me: Groves, and Rivers may I love, Obscure, inglorious.— —O! in Hæmus' Vallies cool Who places me, and covers me with shade Of thickest Trees, embow'ring?— Trap. Virg. Georg. Lib. II. Look round the habitable World, how few Know their own Good: or knowing it, pursue. How void of Reason are our Hopes and Fears! What, in the Conduct of our Life, appears So well design'd, so luckily begun, But, when we have our Wish, we wish undone?— Dryd. Juv. Sat. X. For what do You imagine that I care? What think You is the Subject of my Pray'r? Be my Estate just what it is, or less, 'Twill still be large enough for Happiness! And grant I may, if Heav'n more Years will give, Live to myself, the Time I have to live! Let me have Books, and Food to serve a Year, Lest I should wav'ring hang 'twixt Hope and Fear! This, this is all, for which Mankind should pray, And beg of JOVE: who gives, and takes away. Let him but Life, and mod'rate Plenty find, And I'll provide my self an happy Mind.— Creech alter'd. Hor. Lib. I. Ep. 18. My Fortune might I form at Will, My Canvas, Zephyrs soft, should fill With gentle Breath: lest ruder Gales Crack the Main-Yard, or burst the Sails. By Winds, that temperately blow, My Barque should pass secure and slow: Nor scare me, leaning on her Side, But smoothly cleave the unruffled Tide.— Addison. Sen. Œdip. Wit. The rolling Sea rewards the Merchant's Pains, And pays his Confidence with ample Gains: The Sons of Mars, in War and Battles bold, Return with Plunder rich, and cloth'd in Gold: The drunken Scoundrel Parasite can lie On costly Couches, ting'd with purple Dye: He that debauches other People's Wives, Receives his pay, and by his Baseness thrives: Poor Wit alone a Threadbare Garment wears, And courts those Arts, for which no Mortal Cares.— Petron. Arb. Woman. See Wife. —A woman is a Thing Still various, and uncertain.— Virg. Æn. Lib. IV. Tears in abundance ever wait her Will, To be squeez'd out, and over-flow her Eyes, Just as Occasion serves.— Juv. Sat. VI. Woman is soft and of a tender Heart, Apt to receive, and to retain Love's Dart: Man has a Breast robust, and more secure, It wounds him not so deep, nor hits so sure. Men oft are false: and, if You search with Care, You'll find less Fraud imputed to the Fair.— Dryden. Ovid. Art. Am. Perfidious Woman naturally deceives, And all her Speeches are like falling Leaves: Which when the Winds have from the Branches tore, About they're blown a-while, and seen no more. Ovid. Am. Lib. II. There's nothing bolder than a Woman caught: Guilt gives 'em Courage to maintain their Fault.— Dryden. Juv. Sat. VI. No Cause is try'd at the litigious Bar, But Women Plaintiffs, or Defendants are. They form the Process, all the Briefs they write: The Topicks furnish, and the Pleas indite: And teach the toothless Lawyer how to bite.— Id. Ibid. Poor vain Ogulnia, on the Poet's Day, Will borrow Cloths, and Chair, to see the Play: Will spend the last Half-Crown of her Estate, And pawn the last remaining Piece of Plate. Some are reduc'd their utmost Shifts to try, But Women have no Shame of Poverty: Beyond their Stint they live: as if their Store The more exhausted would encrease the more: Some Men, instructed by the lab'ring Ant, Provide against th' Extremities of Want: But Womankind, that never knows a Mean, Down to the Dregs their sinking Fortunes drain: Hourly they give, and spend, and waste, and wear, And think no Pleasure can be bought too dear.— Id. Ibid. I know full well the giddy Mind of Woman: Would You? They won't: but, if You won't, They will.— Ter. Eun. When Tatius rul'd the antient Sabine Race, Then rough, and careless of a handsome Face, The Women took more Pains to earn their Bread At Plow, and Cart, than how to dress the Head. All Day their Task the busy Matrons ply'd, Or spinning sat, as to their Distaffs ty'd. The Mother then, at Night, would fold the Sheep, Her little Daughter us'd by Day to keep. And when at home, would cleave out Logs of Wood, Or kindle up a Fire to boil their Food. But You, bright Fair! who're form'd in finer Moulds, Must wrap your Limbs in rich brocaded Folds: Must comb, and curl, and with abundant Care Turn up, and braid, and place the shining Hair. With Necklaces and Rings, set off your Charms, Hang Pendants in your Ears, and Bracelets on your Arms: Nor need this Care to please a Blush create, For Men themselves have learn'd to Dress of late.— Tate alter'd. Ovid. de Med. Faciei. World. All mortal Things must change. The fruitful Plain As Seasons turn, scarce knows herself again, Such various Forms she bears: large Empires too, Put off their former Face, and take a new: Yet safe the World, and free from Change doth last: No Years encrease it, nor can Ages waste. It's Course it urges on, and keeps it's Frame, And still will be, for always 'twas the same. Our Fathers saw it, just as now we see, And to our Children it the same shall be: Secure it stands from Time's devouring Rage, For It's a God, unchangeable by Age.— Creech alter'd. Manil. Lib. I. Worship: What sort acceptable to the Gods. But say, ye Priests, if I may be so bold, What are the Gods the better for our Gold? The Wretch that offers from his wealthy Store Such Presents, bribes the Pow'rs to give him more: As Maids to Venus offer Baby-Toys, To bless the Marriage-Bed with Girls and Boys. But let Us for the Gods a Gift prepare, Which the Great Man's great Fortune cannot bear: A Soul, where Laws both human and divine, In Practice more than Speculation shine: A genuine Virtue, of a vig'rous Kind, Pure in the last Recesses of the Mind. When with such Off'rings to the Gods I come, A Cake, thus giv'n, is worth a Hecatomb.— Dryden. Pers. Sat. II. The Blood of Bulls cannot the Gods delight: But from the Heart performing what is Right, Justice, and Truth, are pleasing in their Sight.— Ovid. Epist. Lib. XIX. The pious Off'ring of a piece of Bread, If with pure Hands upon the Altar laid, Than costly Hecatombs will better please Th' offended Gods, and their just Wrath appease.— Hor. L. III. Ode 23. Thou hop'st with Sacrifice of Oxen slain To compass Wealth, and bribe the God of Gain. Increase my Flocks and Herds, Good God, I pray!— Fool! how can they increase, when ev'ry Day, Thy choicest Young are sacrific'd away? Yet think'st Thou when the fatten'd Flames aspire, Thou see'st the Accomplishment of thy Desire. Now, now, my bearded Harvest gilds the Plain! The scanty Folds can scarce my Sheep contain! And Show'rs of Gold come pouring in amain! Thus dreams the Wretch, and vainly thus dreams on, Till his lank Purse declares his Money gone.— Dryd. alt. Pers. Sat. II. The Gods are pure, and Purity require: Before the Pow'rs in spotless Garments stand, And sprinkle Water with unsully'd Hand.— Tibul. Lib. II. El. 1. Wounds. See Battle. Combat. Dying. Slaughter. —Almo fell Shot by a founding Arrow: For the Wound Beneath his Wezon stuck, and with his Blood Clos'd up the Passage of the humid Voice, And choak'd the slender Life.— Trap. Virg. Æn. Lib. VII. Full, as he rose, He bury'd all the Sword Deep in his Breast: and with abundant Death Receiv'd him: He with gushing Wine and Gore Vomits his purple Soul; and dying pours A blended Flood.— Æn. Lib. IX. —The flying Spear Fixes in Sulmo's Back averse: and there The Wood breaks short: the pointed Steel divides His Lungs, and whizzing passes thro' his Breast. Shiv'ring he totters, from his Bosom pours A reeking Flood, and with long Sobs distends His heaving Entrails.— Id. Ibid. Hurt by Themilla first, but slight the Wound, His Shield thrown by, to mitigate the Smart, He clap'd his Hand upon the wounded Part: A feather'd Shaft came swift and unespy'd, And pierc'd his Hand, and nail'd it to his Side: Transfix'd his breathing Lungs, and beating Heart: The Soul came issuing out, and hiss'd against the Dart.— Id. Ibid. Then rising, on his utmost Stretch he stood: And aim'd from high: the full descending Blow Cleaves the broad Front and beardless Cheeks in two: Down sinks the Warrior with a thund'ring Sound, His pond'rous Limbs oppress the trembling Ground: Blood, Brains and Foam, gush from the gaping Wound. Scalp, Face, and Neck, the cutting Steel divides, And the shar'd Visage hangs on equal Sides.— Dryd. Ibid. Lynceus advancing opposite in Arms, And calling on his Friends, with brandish'd Sword From the high Mound he to the Right, assails: At one full Stroke off flew his gasping Head, And, with his Helmet, at a Distance lay.— Trap. Ibid. — The Jav'lin flies Bores his Right Arm, and cuts it's bloody Way: And from his Shoulder by the stringy Nerves The dying Limb hangs down.— Id. Æn. Lib. X. As Lucagus prone, hanging on the Blow, Goads with a Dart his Horses, and prepares, With his Left Foot protended, for the Fight, Beneath the Border of his shining Shield The Spear takes Place, and pierces his left Groin: He from his Chariot dying rolls to Earth.— Id. Æn. Lib. X. Now Podalirius, with his Sword unsheath'd, The Shepherd Alsus, rushing thro' the Darts In the first Rank, pursues, and o'er him him stands Threat'ning aloft: He turning on the Foe, Full in the middle with his Ax divides His Forehead and his Chin: and smears his Arms With spatter'd Brains all o'er: A deadly Rest, And iron Slumber seals his heavy Eyes, And closes them in everlasting Night.— Id. Virg. Æn. Lib. XII. Æneas with a Rock's enormous Weight, Driv'n like a Whirlwind, strikes Murranus down Headlong to Earth.— The Wheels beneath the Axle, and the Reins, Whirl rapid o'er him: and his trampling Steeds Crush him to Mire, unmindful of their Lord.— Id. Ibid. —Ebusus springs on, And aims a Blow: Him Chorinæus meets, And dashes o'er his Face a flaming Brand Snatch'd from the Altar: his huge bushy Beard Blazes, and spreads a Stench. The Other close Urges his startled Foe, and in his Hair Twists his left Hand: and, pressing with his Knee His Stomach, nails him prostrate to the Ground: And plunges in his Side the rigid Steel.— Id. Ibid. He fled full speed; but an unerring Dart O'ertook him, quick discharg'd and sped with Art: Fix'd in his Neck behind, it trembling stood, And at his Throat came out besmear'd with Blood. Prone as his Posture was, he tumbled o'er His Courser's Neck, and bath'd the Ground with steaming Gore.— Croxall alter'd. Ovid. Met. Lib. VI. — A thrilling Dart, By Phæbus guided, pierc'd him to the Heart. This, as they drew it forth, the Midriff tore, It's barbed Point the fleshy Fragments bore, And let the Soul gush out in Streams of purple Gore.— Crox. Ibid. Poor Damasicthon by a double Wound, Beardless, and young, lay gasping on the Ground. Fix'd in his sinewy Ham, the steely Point, Struck thro' his Knee, and pierc'd the nervous Joint: And, as he stoop'd to tug the painful Dart, Another struck him in a vital Part: Shot thro' his Wezon, by the Wing it hung, The Life-Blood forc'd it out, and darting upward sprung.— Id. Ibid. —With both his Hands A Golden Cup he seizes, high emboss'd, And at his Head the massy Goblet toss'd: It hits, and from his Forehead bruis'd rebounds, And Blood, and Brains, he vomits from his Wounds. Thund'ring he falls, along the Floor he lies, And Death for ever shuts his swimming Eyes.— Manwa. Ovid. Met. Lib. V. But closely round an Altar as he hung, And there with trembling Arms for safety clung, Fierce Chromis lop'd his Head, and lop'd so well, The jointed Head upon the Altar fell: And gasping, curs'd among the curling Fires, And in a shining Blaze at last expires.— Hughes. Ibid. Swift from his Hand the winged Jav'lin flies, And Argus of illustrious Lineage wounds: Deep sinks the piercing Point, where to the Loins Above the Naval high the Belly joins: The stagg'ring Youth falls forward on his Fate, And helps the goring Weapon with his Weight.— Rowe. Lucan. Lib. III. One Spear transfix'd his Back, and one his Breast, And deadly met within his heaving Chest. Doubtful awhile the Flood was seen to stay: At length the steely Points at once gave way: Then fleeting Life a twofold Passage found, And ran divided from each streaming Wound.— Id. Ibid. Wretch. Now from the Wood shot sudden forth to View, A Wretch in Rags, that flutter'd as he flew. The human Form in meager Hunger lost! The suppliant Stranger more than half a Ghost, Stretch'd forth his Hands, and pointed to the Coast. We turn'd to view the Sight:—His Vest was torn, And all the tatter'd Garb was tagg'd with Thorn. His Beard hangs long, and Filth the Wretch distains, And scarce the Shadow of a Man remains. Soon as our Dardan Dress and Arms he view'd, In Fear suspended for a Space he stood: Stood, stop'd, and paus'd:—then springing forth he flies, All headlong to the Shore with Pray'rs and Cries. Oh! by this vital Air, the Stars on high, By ev'ry pitying Pow'r who treads the Sky! Ye Trojans take me hence; I ask no more: But bear, Oh! bear me to some other Shore. Then kneel'd the Wretch, and suppliant clung around My Knees with Tears, and grovell'd on the Ground.— Pitt. Æn. Lib. III. Writing. Phœnicians first, if ancient Fame be true, The wond'rous Art of forming Letters knew: They first essay'd, as 'twere by Magic bound, To picture Speech, and fix the flying Sound: By uncouth Figures which their Fancy wrought, Colour and Body gave to Voice and Thought. Then Memphis, e'er the ready Leaf was known, Engrav'd her Precepts and her Arts on Stone: With Birds and Beasts, in various Order plac'd, The learned Hieroglyphick Column grac'd.— Rowe alt. Lucan. Lib. III. Year. Perceiv'st thou not the Process of the Year, How the four Seasons in four Forms appear, Resembling human Life in ev'ry Shape they wear? Spring first, like Infancy, shoots out her Head, With milky Juice requiring to be fed: Helpless, tho' fresh: and wanting to be led. The green Stem grows in Stature and in Size, But only feeds with Hope the Farmer's Eyes. Then laughs the childish Year, with Flow'rets crown'd, And lavishly perfumes the Fields around: But no substantial Nourishment receives, Infirm the Stalks, unsolid are the Leaves. Proceeding onwards, whence the Year began, The Summer grows adult, and ripens into Man: This Season, as in Men, is most replete With kindly Moisture and prolific Heat. Autumn succeeds: a sober, tepid Age, Not froze with Fear, nor boiling into Rage: More than mature, and tending to Decay, When our brown Locks begin to mix with Grey. Then aged Winter comes with trembling Pace, Depriv'd of Strength, despoil'd of ev'ry Grace, And bald, or white as Snow, concludes the Race.— Dryd. alt. Ovid. Met. Lib. XV. Zephyr. See Winds. His balmy Wings auspicious Zephyr shakes, The trickling Dew a joyous Season makes: Where-e'er he flies appears the vernal Dye: The Ground is green, and smiles the cheerful Sky. With crimson Grace he paints the blushing Rose, He on the darker Hyacinth bestows A shaded Splendor, and with Purple bright Makes the sweet scented Violet delight. Not so, with Gems enchas'd, around the Loins Of Parthian Kings the glitt'ring Girdle shines. What Fleece, that with Assyrian Tincture glows, Such rich Variety of Beauty shows? Not Juno's Bird, the Glory of the Skies, Proud of his Tail diversify'd with Eyes, Displays such Colours in his curious Train, Nor the bright changeful Bow, that circles round the Rain. Claud. Rapt. Pros. Zones. See Embroidery. Five Zones the Heav'ns infold: with constant Sun Still red, still scorch'd in torrid Heat the One: Round This, on either Hand, wind distant Coasts, Regions of Storm, and everlasting Frosts. Betwixt the First, and These, by bounteous Heav'n To feeble Mortals Two are kindly giv'n: A-cross them both a Path oblique inclines, Where in successive Order turn the Signs.— Virg. Georg. I. And, as two equal Zones on either Side, On Right, and Left, the measur'd Heav'n's divide, While the Fifth rages with intenser Heat; So Lines alike this earthly Ball compleat. The Sun with Rays directly darting down, Inhabitable makes the Middle Zone: On Two, eternal Hills of Snow are seen: And Two, indulgent Heav'n has plac'd between: Whose Climes a due proportion'd Mixture hold, Temper'd with equal Parts of Heat and Cold.— Ovid. Met. Lib. I. The ambient Air does this our Earth surround, And five Divisions on its Orb are found: Two Parts thereof in cheerless Regions lye, Where Frost and Cold eternal fills the Sky: There sullen Night sits brooding o'er the Ground, And all with Darkness are invelop'd round. No living Waters there the Lands divide, No gentle Streams in mazy Wand'rings glide; But everlasting Ice the Floods constrains, And Drifts of Snow o'erspread the dreary Plains: There never did the Sun diffuse a Ray, Or give the chearful Promise of a Day. The middle Regions feel the scorching Sun, Whether he nearer brings our Summer on, Or when he does a swifter Course display, And in short Circles wheels the wintry Day. There then the Plough can never be in Use, No Corn the Fields, nor Herbs the Lands produce: No God, indulgent, makes the Fields his Care, Bacchus and Ceres never visit there. No Cattle there can graze the parch'd-up Ground, There nothing that possesses Life is found. Between the freezing Cold, and scorching Heat, Our temp'rate Zone is plac'd, a happy Seat! To this oppos'd a fellow Climate lies; Happy alike the Temper of its Skies. Here, first, the stubborn Steer to Toil was broke, And Oxen bent their Necks beneath the Yoke: Here Vines were taught to climb the neighb'ring Trees, And annual Harvests gave a large Increase. Here first the Soil receiv'd the iron Plough, Here first the Ocean felt the brazen Prow: Here well-built Towns, and mighty Cities rise, With stately Walls, and Tow'rs that brave the Skies.— Dart alter'd. Tibul. Lib. IV. El. 1. FINIS.</field>
