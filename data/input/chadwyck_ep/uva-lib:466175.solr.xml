I At humble distance from Apollo's shrine, A wandering minstrel seeks it in the dark, And, all unworthy of the flame divine That warms his betters, asks but for a spark: Fain would he soar, as mounts the matin lark, But for a Pegasus who ne'er, God wot, Had wings to bear him up beyond the mark Of sluggish walk, or jolting doggrel trot, Yet drive this jade he must, tho', faith, he'd rather not. II Of Cam and Isis, (whose inspiring streams By L.L.D.; B.A.; A.M.; invoked, Have so besprinkled their poetic dreams, They've sung, like Maro, or, like Flaccus, joked) Ne'er may the sources be by blockheads choked, Where wit, in classic wreaths, the Sisters twine; Had but my cranium in such springs been soak'd, Oh! Alma Mater! tho' no son of thine, My worthy mother's son had better woo'd the Nine. III Yet deem not Cam, that ign'rance quite pervades My brain, tho' never in thy halls refined; Nor Isis, think thine academic shades, Tho' out of sight, were always out of mind; Thoughts of ye both, to neither tho' consigned, Wou'd put my infant bosom in a flutter; For oft my taste was seriously inclined, With how much goût I'm half ashamed to utter, To Oxford sausage rich; and curious Cambridge butter. IV A sort of wish for these, may yet remain. (There's no accounting for the tastes of men), Else had I spared the luckless reader's pain In following thro' its cheerless path, my pen; Nor had I roused that lion in his den, Yclep'd Reviewer; better had I halt;— But Bard, and Critic, both eat now and then, And if Bard's errors furnish Critic's food, He'll feel, though not allow, they've done some good. V One glorious thought my meditation chears, A hope that gives some courage to the Muse, A claim she dares to make, because she fears No Critic living can the plea refuse; Reader, you may reject it if you chuse, But that you'll scarcely think of, when you're told, In spite of all who pity and abuse, 'Tis Insignificance hath made her bold, 'Gainst Censure, hissing hot, or Commendation cold. PART THE FIRST. From the Aborigines to the End of the Heptarchy. The Ancient Britons.—Four Love Songs of the Young Aborigines—the Romans—Caractacus—Boadicea—the Saxons— the Heptarchy—Kent—Antiquity of Punning—Northumberland—East Anglia—Mercia, Essex, Sussex, Wessex. Bold were those Britons, who, the careless sons Of Nature, roam'd the forest-bounds, at once Their verdant city, high embowering fane, And the gay circle of their woodland wars. Thomson. Their's was the science of a martial race, To shape the lance, or, decorate the shield: Ev'n the fair virgin stain'd her native grace, To give new horrors to the tented field. Shenstone. THE ANCIENT BRITONS. When Britons “first at Heaven's command, Arose,” by chronicles we're told, They wore no cov'ring, thro' the land, But Paint to guard their bodies from the cold. The Celtic beaux, of frame robust, With Celtic belles, almost as stout, Thro' wind, and rain, and sun, and dust, Thus only, kept the weather out: 'Till men grew sick of paint, and cou'dn't bear it, Some of the ladies (I believe) still wear it: Not that the ancient warriors of our Isle Wou'd fly their colours;—no—the sturdy elves, (Spite of the critic's pun-detecting smile) Beheld their colours fly, and not themselves. Folks who were rich were painted mortal fine, With fish, and fowl, and suns, and moons, and beasts; And those best painted oftenest ask to dine, And burn fat prisoners at Druid-feasts. Those who were poor, or very much in debt, For oil and turpentine, Historians say, Were merely white washed, 'tis a custom yet, Much in observance “More honoured in the breach.” Shakespeare. at this very day. Then too, as now, ladies, when least attired, For what they did not wear, were most admired. “Yet ev'n these charms from insult to protect, “Some club-arm'd Warrior stood, terrific, nigh, “With uncouth forms, and shapeless monsters deck'd, “Who thus implored his mistress, with a sigh: Vide Gray's Elegy in a Country Church Yard. (Observe, that, when these rough-hewn rhymes they sung, The ancient Britons were but very young.) CŒDWALLA to EDDA. An Ancient British Love-Song. I. By those raven-dyed ringlets that float round thy form, And circle that heaven thy beauties display; By that face, like the sun-beam that peeps thro' the storm, Our hopes to encourage, our fears to allay; By that dove, dearest Edda, pourtrayed on thy breast;— With one smile of assent let Cœdwalla be blest! Druid Chiefs my suit befriend, While the misletoe I twine, Let the sacred flame ascend, Say, shall Edda's charms be mine? II. By the speed of my coursers in hunting and war, Whose trembling impatience for action I prize; By the scythes on my chariot, less dangerous far, Than the shafts dearest Edda can dart from her eyes, By the groans of the wounded, the shades of the slain, I beseech thee, dear Edda, to shorten my pain! Holy Druid Chiefs, befriend, While the misletoe I twine, See the sacred flame ascend, Edda must, and shall, be mine. EDDA to CŒDWALLA. Being the Answer of an Ancient British Damsel in her Teens. I. Chief of thy daring tribe, with pride I see Those looks, of late so dreadful to the foe, Soften to kindness, when they bend on me, As melts, in cheering Spring, the mountain's snow. II. Yes, seek the altars of our warlike sires, With rev'rence bend before each hallowed shrine, Pure be thy passion, as their sacred fires, And, Heaven approving, Edda shall be thine. These were their sentiments, or may have been, 'Ere Britons found the way to Gretna Green; But these, however homely, were the strains Of lovers of haut ton, and form'd with pains. When meaner folks by Cupid were perplexed, Haply a ditty, simple as the next, Might have been carol'd to a lady's maid, By some bold serjeant, corporal, or the like, Should it want force your faculties to strike, Remember War, not Writing, was his trade. COURTSHIP of the CANAILLE. I My love's so like a fine field day, No colour does she lack; But varied, as the rainbow gay, She's straiter in the back. II Her nose is red, her lips are blue, Her chin as green as grass; And what of saffron colour'd hue, Can Ila's neck surpass? III My heart how soft it's grown to prove, Next prisoner I take, I'll shut him in an image, love, And burn him for thy sake. IV Or shou'd we e'er be put to flight, And savage foes give chace, I'll pierce thy bosom with delight, To save thee from disgrace. The MAIDEN's REPLY. I My love, of pilfering Danes the dread, What warrior may abide? A lion's painted on his head, A dragon decks his side. II A wolf grins lovely on his chest, A serpent twines his arms, And captives' hides which form his vest Add softness to his charms. III When forth he strides with martial glee, No peasant dares to laugh; He wears a bull upon each knee, A cow on either calf. IV I know a little Druid's cell, I know the Druid too, And, if we ask him, who can tell, What gold for us may do? V They say true lovers oft he weds, And with a sacred bough Sprinkles cold water on their heads, To warm the mutual vow. Such were our ancestors, or such I've sung 'em, Till Veni, Vidi, Vici, came among 'em. No Nelson on the well-defended main Was there, to beat the Roman back again; No Abercrombie—but—the countless names Of heroes, who'd have wrapt their fleet in flames, O'erpower the Muse: Ah! had the least of those Been placed between Britannia England, including Wales, was. at the invasion of the Romans, divided into the following seventeen states: CALLED BY THE ROMANS, 1 The Danmonii; now, the counties of Cornwall and Devon. 2 Durotriges; Dorsetshire. 3 Belgæ; Somerset, Wilts, part of Hants. 4 Attrebatii; Berks. 5 Regni; Surrey, Sussex, and remaining part of Hants. 6 Cantii; Kent. 7 Dobuni; Gloucester and Oxon. 8 Cattieuchlani; Bucks, Bedford, and Herts. 9 Trinobantes; Essex, and Middlesex. 10 Iceni; Suffolk, Norfolk, Huntingdon, and Cambridge. 11 Coritani; Northampton, Leicester, Rutland, Lincoln, Nottingham. and Derby. 12 Cornavi; Warwick, Worcester, Stafford, Chester, and Shropshire. 13 The Silures; Radnor, Brecon, Glamorgan, Monmouth, and Hereford. 14 Demetœ; Pembroke, Cardigan, Caermarthen. 15 Ordovices; Montgomery, Merioneth, Caernarvon, Flint, and Denbigh. 16 The Brigantes; York, Durham, Lancashire, Westmoreland, and Cumberland. 17 Ottadini; Northumberland to the Tweed. and her foes; Cæsar had prov'd a baffled, beaten, fool, Had fled with foul dishonour from our shore; Nor had I, and some thousand dunces more, Been, through his Commentaries, whipt at school. “The Romans in England, once did sway,” Ballad, by Collins. It was about fifty-five years before the Christian Æra that Rome, at the height of her glory as a Republic, determined to add Britain to her Empire. Lucan, Horace, Tacitus, and Tibullus dissent from the idea of the absolute Conquest of Britain. The latter says:—“Te manet invictus Romana Marte Britannus.” Vide J. P. Andrews. “Witness the toil, “The Blood of Ages, bootless to secure “Beneath an Empire's yoke a stubborn Isle, “Disputed hard, and never quite subdu'd.” Thomson. THE ROMANS. A. C. 55. Well, Cæsar came, saw, conquer'd, and went home, Came back, return'd, and met his fate in Rome; 'Tis said, he somewhat civilized our sires, Quench'd, for a time, their sacrificial fires; Gave some slight notion of domestic life, And taught the use of clothes to maid and wife. But yet, whate'er improvement they obtained Was bought with Freedom, for the Romans reign'd. When Cæsar fell, Augustus, fond of peace, By acquiescence, bade our burthens cease; Tiberius, jealous of his General's fame, Left Britain all her freedom but the name; Crack-brain'd Caligula, like modern France, In big bravado, bade his powers advance; Then too, like Gaul, forgot to keep his word, And, loudly threatening—sheathed th' invading sword. Not so when Claudius bore imperial sway, [A. D. 43] He bent the stubborn island to obey; Nor bold Caractacus, his country's pride, Nor bravest chieftains fighting by his side, Prevail'd before the legionary band, Whose iron discipline subdued the land; While the great victim to a conqueror's laws, Greater than King, when chain'd in Freedom's cause, From Cæsar's self extorts deserv'd applause. [A. D. 50.] When Nero's sceptre, o'er the world, began To prove a dæmon blended with a man, Mona, to tyrant priesthood only known, The Druid's senate, sanctum, and their throne, Became the seat of war;—destruction flew O'er the devoted sanguinary crew; Their fates we mourn not, they, whose bloodstain'd knife, In mock religion Among other curious impositions practised on their devotees, the Druids were in the habit of borrowing large sums of them, to be repaid in the other world.—“Druidæ pecuniam mutuo accipiebant in posteriore vita reddituri.” Patricius. prey'd on human life. Whose pow'r, increasing thro' successive reigns, For centuries had held the mind in chains; Worthy to die on that polluted spot Where Virtue was, in Virtue's name, forgot. But thou, whose offspring, neither sex nor age Preserv'd, from more than barb'rous Roman rage, Great Boadicea, glory of thy race, Britannia's honor, and thy foe's disgrace; In burning fancy I behold each fight Where female valour warr'd for Albion's right: Thy very fall perpetuates thy fame, And Suetonius' laurels droop with shame. Vespasian's chieftains kept the land in awe, But soften'd martial into milder law; Agricola, tho' form'd for warlike strife, Revered the decencies of social life; He chaced Galgacus Agricola totally defeated Galgacus, who commanded the last Army the Country could raise, reduced almost the whole of England and Scotland to the denomination of a Roman Province, and began to build the famous Barrier called Picts'-Wall o'er the Northern plain, And bound his footsteps with a mural chain. Adrian and Severus the work pursued, A work extinct, and ne'er to be renewed. No wall again shall British hearts divide, Whose union, is their best, their safest, pride. “Ye gentlemen of England,” who criticise the times, Tho', heav'n knows, they must be rather better than these rhymes; Give ear unto my narrative, and it will plainly shew, That things were ten times worse almost two thousand years ago. For Rome grew a little too big, And the people, like most people, grumbled; At grievances all had a dig, 'Till down the whole edifice tumbled. The nations around, who'd been robb'd of their, pelf, Their freedom, their name, or what not, At Rome were so busy, each helping itself, Our Island alone was forgot. THE BRITONS. The Romans all gone, or of pow'r bereft, Each Briton rejoic'd with his brother; 'Till, finding they'd not one competitor left, They wisely fell out with each other. Protection with unity ever will fly, The Wall too was idly forgot; And, leaping its boundary, hourly you'd spy A stern Pict The Picts, (so called from Pictich, a Plunderer, and not from Picti, painted) and the Scots, from Scuite, a Wanderer, in the Celtic Tongue, were only different tribes of Caledonians. Dr. Henry. or a muckle bra' Scot. “The groans of the Britons” are mournfully sent “To Ætius, Ætius, Prefect of Gaul, was thus addressed by “The Groans of the wretched Britons, to the thrice-appointed Consul, Ætius.—The Barbarians drive us into the Sea, and the Sea forces us back on the swords of the Barbarians.” Ætius was too closely engaged in opposing Attila, the renowned King of the Huns, to spare them any attention. Destruction of the Brittaines. thrice Consul,” who sighs; 446 But turns the ambassadors back as they went, Without one single word of supplies. Each Briton, now dejected and a slave, Flies to the ocean from the foe's attack; Nor less relentless, the destructive wave Devours or hurls them to their tyrants back. “A Nation known only to the Britons by their continued “and successful acts of Piracy.” J. P. Andrews. THE SAXONS. A. D. 447. But hark! what foreign drum on Thanet's isle Proclaims assistance? 'tis the Saxon band, By Hengist led, and Horsa;—see, they smile, And greet their hosts, with false, insidious hand. Not arms alone they bring, but specious art, And beauty, too, must aid the plan they lay; Rowena, form'd to bear a nobler heart, Can stoop a falling monarch to betray. The Saxons, it is supposed, gained great advantages over Britain by means of a foolish passion which the old Vortigern conceived for the young and beautiful Rowena, niece to Hengist “She presented him,” (say our old Historians) “on her knee, with a cup of wine, saying ‘Waes heal, hlaford cyning,’ or, ‘Be of health, Lord King’! to which Vortigern, being instructed in the custom, answered ‘Drinc heal,’ or, ‘I drink your health’—This introduction led to the subsequent marriage of Rowena to Vort gern, who felt no more anxiety respecting the Saxon encroachments on his dominions. Verstegan, &amp;c. &amp;c. Imprudent Vortigern! how much to blame! What! yield a throne to Woman's asking eye! Had I been there,—I should have done the same, But then, the prince was wrong,—and so am I. Where, spreading far and wide, old Sarum's plain Presents a prospect, like the boundless main, The ruins of a once tremendous pile, Where white-rob'd Druids held their orgies vile, Yet rise upon the sight;—and here, 'tis said, Where still repose in heaps, the slaughter'd dead, Three hundred nobles of our drooping state, Betray'd by Hengist, met a savage fate. Stone-Henge yet called,—perhaps, the words impart The traitor's name, and texture of his heart. To Vortigern The British Kings from Vortigern, till the settlement of the Saxons at the time of the Heptarchy, after which Wales became the seat of Government of the genuine Britons, were Aurelius, Ambrosius, Uther Pendragon, Arthur, Constantine II. Conan, Vortipor, Malyo, Coranus, Caractacus II. Cadwan, Cadwallan, Cadwallader; —for the succession of Welch Princes see the reign of Edward I. deposed, his son Vortimer. in vain Succeeding fought to stem the Saxon tide; In Ailsford's desp'rate battle, Horsa slain, Adds to their names who for ambition died. Weak Vortigern, restored to pow'rless name, Yields Hengist all the profit and the fame. I haste to pass the heart-afflicting page That tells, in fine, how Saxon wiles prevail'd; I turn the retrospect from that dark age, When every manly, patriot, effort fail'd: When British worth was driven to give place To fancied friendship, and a foreign race. The Saxons once well settled, sent, by dozens, The Saxons seem to have anticipated the descriptive mode of naming the months adopted by the modern French Kalendar, the floreal, Germinal, &amp;c. of which, though more elegant, are not more expressive of the Seasons than the following: December—their first month was styled “Midwinter Monath.” January—“Aefter Yula,” or, after Christmas. February—“Sol Monath,” from the returning Sun. March—“Rede” or, “Rethe Monath,” Rugged Month. April—“Easter Monath,” from a Saxon Goddess, whose name we still preserve. May—“Trimilchi,” from Cows being then milked thrice a day. June—“Sere Monath,” dry month. July—“Mœd Monath,” the meads being then in their bloom. August—“Weod Monath,” from the luxuriance of weeds. September—“Hœfest, (or, Harvest) Monath.” October—“Winter Fyllith,” from Winter approaching, with the full moon of that month. November—“Blot Monath,” from the blood of Cattle slain that month, and stored for winter provisions. For brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, and cousins: Call'd this the sweetest island under heaven, And split one little kingdom into seven. “Indeed, Sir, we are seven.” Wordsworth. “While undecided yet which part should fall, “Which nation rise the glorious Lord of all.” Creech's Lucretius. THE HEPTARCHY. Odd numbers are deem'd fortunate, we know, And yet, 'tis odd enough they should be so; The graces, muses, with their threes and nines, Were dear to Pagan reverend divines. The number seven, too, a stand has made; Seven wonders once the universe displayed; Seven deadly sins, seven sacraments assist, Seven sleepers, and my readers in the list; Seven days each week;—on seven if longer dwelling, 'Twill cost me seven too many lines the telling. Seven kingdoms once our little isle admitted, Each with a king, and queen, and courtiers, fitted. East Anglia, Mercia, Essex, Sussex, Kent, Northumberland, and Wessex; each extent Mark'd carefully, of course, by sovereign order, To settle rates of postage on the border. Now, for digression's sake, I'll simply ask, Who, in each court, wou'd undertake the task Of Clement-Cottrellizing? sure, no dunce, Six English embassies to name at once. The Plenipo from Persia, when with us, Could ne'er create more diplomatic fuss; The newspaper, when things unkindly went, Announces “The Ambassador from Kent— “Having received a warm official note, “Has left this country—in a Gravesend boat.” “The Essex envoy, too, has turn'd his back, “And quits the kingdom—in a neutral hack, “Attended by a confidential friend, “Whose passport goes no further than Mile-end.” “Bold Sussex, in a ministerial rage, “Departs to-morrow—in the Brighton stage!” “While great East-Anglia, flouncing like a dragon, “Has taken places in the Norwich waggon.” Critics will smoke by this time, without doubt. London and Essex both obey'd one king— Agreed, grave sirs, and now the blunder's out, Let my joke pass, and take your ample swing. THE KINGDOM OF KENT. Began 457—Ended 823.—Metropolis, Canterbury. “Kent, in the Commentaries Cæsar writ, “Is term'd the civil'st place of all this isle:— “Sweet is the country,—beauteous,—full of riches,— “The people liberal,—valiant,—active,—worthy.” Shakespeare. THE KINGDOM OF KENT. Garden of Britain! whose white cliffs have named Our island Albion.—Kent! so justly famed For bow-men, bishops, monks, and monasteries, For warriors, watering-places, hops, and cherries. I name thy monarchs of the Saxon race; Escus, then Octa, ruled in Hengist's place; Next Hermenric, and Ethelbert succeed; The last, renowned for many a valiant deed, But most renowned, that, to the Pagan's loss, By Austin taught, he rear'd the sacred cross, [A. D. 597.] His ear and heart inclin'd to Christian lore, And light diffus'd, where darkness reign'd before. St. Paul's Cathedral, form'd but rudely then, 604 First rose where now the spot is graced by Wren. Two well-form'd Englishmen were ask'd at Rome, By Pontiff Gregory, to name their home. “We're Angli called,” the British spokesman cried. “Say rather Angeli,” the Pope replied. “So would ye be, were you of Christian race.” And Austin's mission, hence, 'tis said, took place. This Gregory, most pious and most wise, Made, at that time, three similar replies. Enquiring further the name of their Province, he was answered Deiri; (a district of Northumberland) “Deiri” replied he, “that is good; they are called to the Mercy of God from his Anger; that is, De Ira.” “But how is the King of that Province named?” He was told Ælla, or Alla; “Alleluia!” cried he, “we must endeavor that the praises of God be sung in their Country.” Hume. We have thought proper to select but one, To shew the Ancients not disdain'd a pun; That even Popes, of Toleration full, A joke enjoy'd, and patroniz'd a bull. While this dull age, as duller people name it, Sees wit, folks tell ye, winking in the socket, And swears, who makes a pun, howe'er he frame it, With equal eagerness would pick a pocket. Vide Murphy's Grays-Inn Journal. The son of Ethelbert, unlike his sire, (To Woden's worship and incestuous fire Basely devoted) scorn'd religion's ties, And, in too-late repentance, clos'd his eyes.— Ercombert, Egbert, Lothaire, Widred, reign'd, Eadbert and Ethelbert the crown sustain'd; Next Alric, Egbert, Cuthred, Baldred, sway'd, 'Till one great Egbert all the land obey'd. KINGDOM OF NORTHUMBERLAND. Began A. D. 547.—Ended 792.—Comprised two Kingdoms, Bernicia and Deira.—Bamburgh and York were the Capitals. KINGDOM OF NORTHUMBERLAND. Scene of full many a desp'rate border fight! (Where Northern Chiefs, in ancient order dight, By Percys led, met gallant Scots in arms;— Percys, for prowess fam'd and female charms,) Thy first king Adelfrid historians name, 'Till conquest prov'd young Edwin's better claim. (Such just administration his, we're told, Infants might safely bear uncounted gold!) 'Till slain by Mercian Penda. Civil jars Divide Northumbria; and continued wars By Osric, Eanfrid, Oswald, Oswy, waged, Destroyed those monarchs; nor less furious raged, While Egfrid, Alfred, Osred, Celwolf,—all, Fought but to reign; and only reign'd to fall. Like Oswald, Mollo, Ailred, slain; deposed Like Celwold, Osred, Ethelbert, they closed A list of horrors, fated not to cease, 'Till Egbert Union gave, and Union Peace. THE KINGDOM OF EAST-ANGLIA. Began 575.—Ended 793.—Included Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, Norfolk, and the Isle of Ely.—Dunwich was the Royal Residence. THE KINGDOM OF EAST-ANGLIA. Matter of fact is dull, when told at best, Then how can coarsest poetry digest Such names as Uffa, Earpwold, and a host Of Egrics, Alduffs, Elfwolds; who but boast Short usurpation, or sad length of feud, With fate of friends and subjects' blood imbrued! The sanction of the venerable Bede, Who saw so many monarchs reign and bleed, Pourtrays a cheerless picture of that time, When crime expelled was but expelled by crime; When chiefs, alternate doom'd to smile or groan, Saw Anglia fall before the Mercian throne! Yet here, 'mid deeds that sullied British earth, Cambridge! By some supposed to have been founded by Edward the Elder. thy seat of learning first had birth From Sigebert;—like the eastern star it rose, To cheer the dim horizon;—Sigebert's name Derives from hence more enviable fame, Than from a thousand fields of slaughter'd foes. THE KINGDOM OF MERCIA. Began 582.—Ended 847.—Contained Huntingdon, Rutland, Lincoln, Northampton, Leicester, Derby, Nottingham, Oxford, Chester, Salop, Gloucester, Worcester, Stafford, Warwick, Bucks, Bedford.—Metropolis, Leicester. THE KINGDOM OF MERCIA. O'er midland Mercia, Wibba rul'd;—his crôwn He left to Leorl.—Penda's chief renown Sprang from his turbulence; by Oswy slain, Peada, and swift-succeeding sovereigns reign, Then Offa, well-beloved by Charlemagne. Wiglaff, last ruler, Egbert taught to yield Lord of his fate, and master of the field. THE KINGDOM OF ESSEX, OR, EAST SAXONS. Began 527.—Ended 746.—Contained Essex, Middlesex, Part of Herts.—Capital, London. THE KINGDOM OF ESSEX, OR, EAST SAXONS. Of Essex monarchs, little more is said Than, that two kings among them lov'd white bread: Sexted and Seward, sons and conjunct successors to Sebert, grandson of Erkinwin, who founded the kingdom of Essex. To shew the rude manner of living in that age, Bede tells us, that these two kings expressed great desire to eat the white bread distributed by Mellitus, the bishop, at the communion. But on his refusing them, unless they would submit to be baptised, they expelled him their dominions. Hume. That Offa took great Penda's child to wife, And vow'd, when married, to be chaste for life: That Westminster, if records are believ'd, From Sebert's gift her Abbey Church receiv'd; By Sleda govern'd first, by Sigered last, This state, with other states, to Egbert pass'd. THE KINGDOM OF SUSSEX, OR, SOUTH SAXONS. Began 490.—Ended 600.—Contained Sussex and Surrey.— Metropolis, Chichester. THE KINGDOM OF SUSSEX, OR, SOUTH SAXONS. Sussex! of modern summer beaux the boast, When British beauty gladdens Albion's coast; Where waves transparent soften, more than hide, Those charms, encircled by the happy tide. Sussex! which erst saw conqu'ring William land, And subject England to his iron hand. Thine ancient chronicles have less in store, Than the imperfect legends sung before; A long parenthesis of names, I ween From Œlla down to Adelwalch is seen; 'Till Egbert's, paramount by all confess'd, Like Aaron's pow'rful rod engulphs the rest. THE KINGDOM OF WESSEX, OR, WEST SAXONS. Began 519.—Ended 1066,—Comprised Hants, Berks, Wilts, Somerset, Dorset, Devon, Part of Cornwall, and the Isle of Wight.—Chief City, Winchester. THE KINGDOM OF WESSEX, OR, WEST SAXONS. A race of warlike princes, whose success This realm increas'd, and other realms made less, From Cerdic and his sons, to Brithric reign'd, And still accession of domain obtain'd. Wessex each neighbouring monarch could controul, And spread, like snows that gather as they roll. 'Till Egbert's genius, by misfortune taught, In camps and courts each gainful lesson caught; By travel tutor'd, and by woes made wise, By others' fall instructed how to rise, Egbert securely mounted England's throne, And made the Seven Kingdoms all his own. —Though Egbert became Monarch of England, he was not perfectly absolute;—he actually possessed Wessex, Sussex, Kent, and Essex, which had been peopled by Saxons and Jutes, and contented himself with preserving the sovereignty over the other three Kingdoms, (originally inhabited by the Angles) and permitting them to be governed by Kings who were his vassals.

EGBERT. Egbert o'er Kings subdu'd scarce 'gan to reign, E're he's invaded by the savage Dane The Danes first landed in 789, and were so little known that a peace officer, at Portland, asked them, in the name of his King, (Brithric,) what they did there? unused to the checks of magistracy, these uncivilized rovers murdered the intruder, plundered the country, and retired unmolested. H. Hunt, Saxon Chronology.. Charmouth, in Dorsetshire, supplied the field Where British chiefs to foreign leaders yield Had it not been for this unfortunate battle, (in which the Bishops Wigfurth and Herefurth, and the Earls Dudda and Osmond were slain,) Egbert would have added North Wales to his dominions, having already over-run the country to the foot of Snowdon. J. P. Andrews.. Yet, soon avenged, the English blood they spill; A year not pass'd, when famous Hengsdown-Hill Proves, to the northern spoilers dear bought cost, That Egbert cou'd regain what late he lost. The King in peace lived five succeeding years, And his best epitaph was England's Tears The following was inscribed on a chest containing his and other royal bones, at Winchester:Hic Rex Egbertus pausat cum Rege Kenulpho, Nobis egregia munera uterque tulit,. “The Danes are landed.” Home. ETHELWOLF. The warwhoop echoes still our Island round, And, as the surge encroaching on the land, Gives note of mischief by terrific sound, Like wave on wave, the robbers crowd to land. The Danes! The Danes! the young and aged cry, And mothers “press their infants” as they fly. Nothing could be more dreadful than the manner in which these fierce barbarians carried on their incursions; they spared neither age nor sex, and each commander urged the soldiers to inhumanity. Oliver, a celebrated chieftain, gained, from his dislike to the favorite amusement of his soldiers, (that of tossing children on the points of their spears,) the contemptuous surname of Burnakal, or, “the Preserver of Children.” Bartholin. The pirate parties, spreading far and wide, Avoid our armies, and our powers deride: Then to their barks return, like loaded bees, And, with our ravish'd treasure, cross the seas. Oh, had but then some tight built ships, and tars, Like modern Trigges, and Trollopes, round them cruised: How brief had been their predatory wars, What trouble had my readers been excused! O'er Thanet, now the scene of summer mirth, Where, erst, the world's imperial eagle flew, Where the white steed on Saxon banners came, The Danish raven's wing is spread; And an unsparing and remorseless crew, By Scandinavian chieftains led, Demand in Kent to share, with British birth, “A local habitation and a name.” While Ethelwolf, who shou'd have made them run, (As gallic navies since at Nelson's fame), Gave to Athelstan, as his eldest son, One half the Kingdom—and ('twas more than shame!) Instead of watching England's weal at home, He went on pious pilgrimage to Rome. To Rome, who having then no arms to rule us, Deputed Monks to govern and befool us. And, well I wot, the Pope was glad to see him, Who paid Priests, Deacons, Choristers and all, With pockets full of England's gold to fee him, And purchase lamps for Peter and for Paul One of the pious pretences under which the papal see obtained money from bigotted princes was that of selling sacred lamps to burn before figures of the apostles.. At home he found affairs had changed their faces; His first son dead, and Ethelbald, the next, Usurper of his Sire's and Brother's places, The former's weakness furnishing pretext. Scarce do the Son and Sire the land divide, When the King feed the Monks once more, and died: To future reigns the people turn their hope, And Ethelwolf's regretted—by the Pope. “This crown I part between you.” Shakespeare. ETHELBALD and ETHELBERT. Ethelwulph's grants to the Clergy were such, Let this lesson œconomy teach, From the State to the Church he had given so much, His Sons got but half a Crown each. But, then he'd two younger lads, critics may cry, Perhaps so, we'll talk about them by and bye. Prince Ethelbert proved himself worthy his birth, I can't say as much for his Brother, Who being the veriest monster on earth, Was actually wed to his Mother— In law,—Lady Judith,—not she who so called Destroy'd Holofernes the big, But daughter to Emperor Charley, the bald, So named from the want of a wig. We can't say that Ethelbald's reign was long lived, Or happy the period his brother survived; He was teazed by the Danes, who in England wou'd sway, But died'ere he'd give the marauders their way. “Dulce &amp; decorum, est pro patria mori.” Horace. ETHERED, or ETHELRED. Wou'd that past records happier tales could tell Of Ethered than truth has handed down! Few years he reign'd, by Alfred's side he fell, Defending England's honor and his crown. A taint of Superstition dimm'd, alas! A mind by nature meant to shine more bright; Tho' brave, he fear'd to leave unfinish'd mass, Till Danes near won the day at Aston fight. This folly almost cost a brother's life; But Alfred's arm upheld the doubtful strife. The following inscription was placed over King Ethered's tomb: “In hoc loco quiescet corpus Sancti Ethelredi, Regis West “Saxonum Martyris, qui A. D. 872, 23 die Aprilis, per manum “ducorum paganorum occubuit.” So in our days Iberia's chief, they say, Lost Spain, and Britain join'd, a glorious day! And let the Gallic Victor run away. Vide Dispatches from Spain in the London Gazette, when Marshal Victor was permitted to escape from a most disadvantageous position, through the Spanish General's horror of fighting on a holy day. “He was a man, (then boldly dare to say,) “In whose rich soule the vertues well did sute, “In whom so mix'd the elements all lay, “That none to one cou'd sou'raigntre impute, “As all did governe, yet all did obey; “He of a temper was so absolute “As that it seem'd when nature him began “She meant to shew all that might be in man.” Drayton. “A little island boasts his glorious birth, “His fame for wisdom fills the spacious earth.” Pope. ALFRED THE GREAT. When Guthrum's Guthrum was King of the Danes. momentary might Had taken place of Alfred's right His fainting friends, dispersing, fled, While he a life erratic led, Folding the herdsman's flock for bread. Condemn'd that bread himself to bake, And when (his royal thoughts astray, On projects soon to see the day,) His mind to nobler tasks awake, He tended ill the household cake; A woman's tongue, a woman's blows, Add to the humbled Monarch's woes. More watchful for his suff'ring state, Alive to every turn of fate, Alfred assumes a temporary throne; Where stagnate thick the Parret and the Thone. In Athelney two acres in extent Scarce hold the British Sov'reign's tent; Yet here, encircled by a daring few, The hero's future greatness grew. From hence, in oft successful sally, Issue the unexpected warrior band, And chase o'er forest, mount, and valley, The Danish spoilers of our native land. And Oddune, Devon's chief, by Kinwith's towers, Slew Hubba, and destroy'd his pirate powers. The great, good, ruler of the little isle, Who justly balanced fortune's ev'ry smile, Beholds his projects ripening, and goes, In harper's guise, among his num'rous foes. The minstrel's air, and gait, so well he feigns, The royal tent admits him; he obtains Knowledge of martial efforts to be made, And by whose influence each attempt is sway'd: For of intents and means the chiefs spoke loud, Nor heeded Alfred in the mingled crowd; For potent mead, from oft replenish'd shell, Urg'd the gay tongue each inmost thought to tell, While well the harper play'd; and listen'd well. Right skilful was his finger, and right dear The Danes soon learn'd how accurate his ear. “When music, heavenly maid! was young, “When yet in early Greece she sung,” Tho' vast her powers and sweet her tongue, They both had fail'd to celebrate his name, Who, while he struck the antient British lyre, With all the purity of patriot flame, That cou'd a parent Monarch's breast inspire, A meaning drew from ev'ry tone, To Danes, outwitted, little known; Who wanted souls to tell them each proud string Responded to the feelings of a King. Let not the nicely scrupulous exclaim, “The subtle spy obscures the soldier's fame!” By art, as well as arms, his foes succeed, Through foreign art his native subjects bleed. And, when to bring the Dane to open strife, For England's welfare, Alfred risks his life, The noble issue, and the glorious end. To which his perilous adventures tend, Made, in a cause for which he wou'd have died, The means he used his glory and his pride. Those means with most deserv'd success were bless'd; Guthrum, in turn, discomfited, distrest, At Eddington beholds his army beat, And sues for mercy at the Minstrel's feet. Hunted, pursued, by youths whose earlier age Had seen their parents fall by Danish rage, The Danes, now suppliant for British grace, Renounce their Pagan gods, and heathen race; And humbly seek permission to reside In peace with those whom lately they defied. “Ye who have view'd, in pleasure's choicest hour, “The earth embellished on the banks of Stour; “Where, with pure love of smiling nature warm'd, “A second Paradise the founder form'd Hayley's epitaph on Henry Hoare, Esq. in Stourton church, Wilts..” You've seen (not far from where embower'd round, The river's source first glides with trilling sound) On terraced lawn majestically high, Great Alfred's Tow'r, arrest the wond'ring eye; Inscribed by truth, a modern race to shew What solid blessings to his reign we owe. His first-built Navy taught us how to sweep, With flag triumphant, the subservient deep; His English Jury, form'd in happiest hour, Still guards the innocent from lawless pow'r; His battles were, as our traditions fix, (Successful most) in number fifty-six. Yet let not here our admiration cease, Tho' fam'd in war, he lov'd and cherish'd peace. His aim in battle sought no other plan But to convince, then bless, his fellow man! Thy venerable turrets, Oxford, rose, From him, who, unsubdued by fiercest foes, Was great alike in danger and repose. Philosophy and Christian worth combined Their vast effects in one capacious mind. Replete with soul, the Monarch stood alone, And built, on freedom's basis, England's throne. A legislator, A very singular circumstance occurs in those laws which the great Alfred formed for the regulation of the English Church. The introduction produces a copy of the Ten Commandments, in which the second has only these words, “Make not thou gods of gold and silver.” This alteration was certainly made to favor the literal adoration of paintings and images. Andrews, from Spelman. parent, So little was learning attended to by the great, that Asser, the biographer of Alfred, mentions with amazement, the King having taught his youngest son, Ethelward, to read before he made him acquainted with hunting. Elfredi. warrior, sage, He died “the light of a benighted age.” Bede and Orosius, historians grave, A Saxon dress the studious Sov'reign gave; Boethius too, our tongue he taught to speak, And Æsop's morals, from their native Greek. He also rendered the Holy Gospels into the Saxon tongue, in which the Lord's Prayer, (which is inserted here as a specimen of the language of Alfred's day,) stands as follows; Fæder ure thu the earth on heafenum, si thin nama gehalgod, to be cume thin rice, Gewurthe thin willa on eorthan swa swa on heafenum, urne ge dægwanlican hlaf syle us to dæg; and for gyf us ure gyltas, swa swa we forgivath urum gyltendum, and ne gelædde thu us on cosenung ac alyse us of yfle. (Si it swa.) Medulla Historiæ Anglicanæ. Of thirty years in which the land he sway'd, Not one elaps'd but some good laws he made; And proved, as grateful pens record, There never yet was Britain's lord Who better knew to rule, or better was obey'd. “For I shall sing of battles, blood, and rage, “Which princes and their people did engage; “And haughty souls, that moved with mutual hate, “In fighting fields, pursued and found their fate.” Dryden's Virgil. EDWARD THE ELDER. Tho' less renown'd for what the learn'd acquire, Edward in arms was worthy of his sire; And happy for the realm, great Alfred's son, Maintain'd with honor, what his father won; In spite of insurrection, rapine, guilt, And blood that flow'd for blood unjustly spilt. First Ethelwald, from Ethelbert derived, (Tho' two of royal Alfred's sons survived,) Claim'd England's sceptre, and in frequent fight, Warr'd against Justice and his Cousin's right; A Norman and Northumbrian miscreant crew, With Danes and Mercians to his side he drew, And led his pupils in rebellion's school That land to ravage which he might not rule. Edward, with royal indignation fired, Obeyed the impulse which his rage inspired, And peaceful hamlets, towns, and cities mourn The Monarch's and the Rebel's force in turn; For civil discord glories in the ills With which she indiscriminately fills The royal mansion, or the rebel's hold, The patriot cot, or den of ruffian bold, While blood on both sides eagerly she spills. The Kentish men, long England's warlike boast, Assail'd at Bury, by the traitor's host, With Danes maintain'd a most unequal fray, 'Till Ethelwald, his treasons to repay, Lost, with his life, the honor of the day. Northumbria, Mercia, and the scatter'd Dane, Hostile by turns, and unsubdued, remain. A powerful fleet, the Monarch bids prepare, He sails, and quickly the rapacious band Haste to despoil the absent Edward's land; The King, as briefly of their plans aware, Returns, with slaughter Stafford's plains to dye, And see again his flag victorious fly. Yet, by misfortune unsubdued, The restless chiefs again unite, Again their blood the earth imbrued, At Tunsford, and in Maldon fight. Thurktill the Dane, invincible esteem'd, Not so, perdie, by Edward deem'd, Vanquish'd, retreats before the conqu'ror's lance, To pillage other lands in France; At length, by perseverance, toil, and pains, Edward, in well earn'd peace, with glory reigns. He was fortunate not only in military enterprize, but in domestic concerns; he matched four of his nine daughters to the greatest Princes in Europe; and three of his five sons successively mounted their father's throne, Athelstan, Edmund, and Edred. Ladies, if thus far Somnus lets ye look In this my nice narcotic book, It may awake your sex's proper pride, To recollect that, in each doubtful day, Edward had oft a sister by his side, Whose genius pointed to success the way; Active, yet prudent, masculine, yet fair, The widow'd Ethelflida, This patriotic amazon was the wife of Ethered, Duke of Mercia; she is universally said by historians to have been the exact resemblance of her parent Alfred in every quality of the mind, and in many old writings she is actually styled, not Domina, but Rex. J. P. Andrews. good and great Ruled Mercia's province with propitious care, And proved the grand appui of Edward's state. Let it not from the Monarch derogate, That he by female wit was sway'd, Women, when good, are angels, and I wot, (He who denies it is a senseless sot,) Good angels may with safety be obeyed. Edward surviv'd, to grace his sister's urn With a fraternal tear; nor did he mourn Her absence long, but sought that awful bourn, From whence, nor slave nor monarch may return. “Thou nature art my goddess!” Shakespeare. “Ay, my mother, “With all my heart, I thank thee for my father.” Shakespeare. ATHELSTAN. Athelstan's birthright (if they say not well, Blame older tales,) was doubtful.—From his brother, However born, Athelstan bore the belle, I. E. the throne He made his own, And tho' the chances are, he had a mother, Her name, not knowing, we forbear to tell: Where heirs claim interest doubts like these grow double, And hence the King experienced no small trouble. One Alfred first conspired, but being seized, And losing every gleam of hope, Declared, if so his Liege would be appeas'd, He'd swear his innocence before the Pope. The Pope was then a wight of some renown, “Viceroy o'er Monarchs” Shakespeare. he no equal knew, And, sans façon, wou'd crack the iron crown Of any Emperor that look'd askew. Well, Alfred went, and tho' you may despise My tale, 'tis what my betters 'erst have wrote, The oath he took, of most tremendous size, Stuck in his throat. To bear with patience is my muse's pride, Not e'en by incredulity provoked, She asks you'll but believe Lord Alfred died As soon as he was choked. Anlaff, the Dane, against the King essay'd, In minstrel garb, to count his loyal bands; And failing, proved, however well he play'd, The part was better when in Alfred's hands The pride of Anlaff betrayed him; while he explored the hostile camp as a minstrel, a soldier observing him throw away the reward he had received for his performance, watched him and recognized the Northumbrian leader.. Discover'd, and compell'd to open fight, His stratagems and projects end in flight At Brunsbury, where, man to man, The Chancellor of England led the van. And much it grieves the muse to tell, Among the slain a Bishop fell; Thus Lawn and Woolsack both upheld the crown, Not only in the senate, bar, and church, But 'ere they'd leave the Sov'reign in the lurch, E'en Bishops from beneath their beavers frown; While law's great leader, in the place Of painted, gilded, wooden mace, With mace of iron knocks invaders down. And thus in latter days I ween, England's Lord Chancellor I've seen, (With dignity and grace no less, Than when in pride of legal dress. Lord Erskine was a subaltern, or private, in the Bloomsbury Volunteers, and Lord Thurlow was a corporal in the same corps.) In Bloomsbury, at daily drill, Grasp not the ancient weapon 'clep'd Brown Bill, But a more modern mischief, call'd Brown Bess. Guy, Earl of Warwick, now was famed Colbrand, the Danish Chief, he slew, And other deeds he did are named, And many more he did not do. To foster our commercial school, Athelstan made a useful rule; Three voyages for merchants should acquire The rank and place of gentleman, or squire; Had all the squires we daily see So earn'd the right of their assumed degree, Lord! what a travell'd nation we shou'd be! At Glocester, after sixteen well spent years, Athelstan's exit caus'd some genuine tears, And it bespeaks their mutual worth, That Edmund of more certain birth, Against the King his name wou'd never lend, But, like a brother, liv'd his brother's friend, And mourn'd with others his lamented end. “Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.” Shakespeare. EDMUND. Edmund his eighteenth year had not yet known, When he succeeded to Athelstan's throne, And, ecce iterum! the Monarch found The Danes encroaching still on English ground; Malcolm of Scotland having lent him aid, With Westmoreland and Cumberland he paid; And when kind peace was dawning o'er the land, Or e'er six summers smiled upon his reign, By Leolf, leader of a lawless band, The youthful Sov'reign was untimely slain. The King espied this outlaw presumptuously seated at a royal banquet and, being inflamed with wine, seized him by the hair, when the felon, instigated by despair, plunged his dagger in the body of the King: the intoxication of the nobles and attendants permitted the assassin's escape. “Priest-ridden by a man “Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking “Himself with Princes.” Shakespeare. “They who possess the Prince, possess the laws.’ Dryden. EDRED. The name of Edred we record in vain, For this was properly Saint Dunstan's The Monks in England married and supported their families with decency until the reign of Edred, when Dunstan introduced celibacy, and tore their wives and children from the Priests, styling them harlots and bastards. Script. Angl. Passim. reign. Specious, yet haughty, full of smiling evil, And more than match, he boasted, for the Devil. “In friendship false, implacable in hate, “Resolv'd to ruin or to rule the state.” Dryden. The King, whose sword subdu'd a rebel crowd, Before the supercilious Churchman bow'd! The Monk, entrusted with supreme command, Ruled England's Monarch with an iron hand, Pow'rless the sceptre, yielding Edred sway'd. Not his but Dunstan's wishes were obeyed; 'Till Death, who spares nor prince nor peasant swain, Releas'd the master from his servant's chain. “Yet all was colour'd with a smooth pretence “Of specious love, and duty to their Prince, “Religion, and redress of grievances, “Two names that always cheat, and always please.” “The next successor whom I fear and hate, “My arts have made obnoxious to the state; “Turn'd all his virtues to his overthrow, “And gained our elders to pronounce a foe.” Dryden EDWY. So Dunstan thought, and so he wou'd have said, But Dryden wrote not 'till the Monk was dead. Edwy who knew his predecessor's mind, (Warp'd by the Priest, infatuated! blind!) To insignificance had sunk the Throne, Boldly resolv'd at first to “hold his own,” But Edwy was, alas! too young by far, With such a wolf, and fox combined, to war, Fell Dunstan's wiles revengeful, made him feel Where vulnerable most: what breast of steel, What fiend, embodied in a mortal mould, Cou'd have perform'd what—scarce can it be told— Elgiva, fair, the youthful Monarch's wife, Lovely in form, and dear to him as life, A virtuous, blooming, young and new-made bride, Torn from her husband, and her mother's side; By ruffians, whom no human ties cou'd bind, Tortur'd; her frame to ling'ring death consign'd; Her sex insulted, and her charms defaced, By wretches who the forms of men disgraced! Many of the earliest Missionaries were hostile to, and dreaded the company of, the fair sex. The unpolished St. Columba prohibited his catechumens the comforts of milch kine, because, “Where there is a cow,” said the brute, “there must be a woman, and where there is a woman there must be mischief.” Vide Pennant. The people too, deluded by the priest, And Odo, Odo, successively promoted, through Dunstan's influence, to the sees of Worcester, London, and Canterbury, is handed down to posterity by the Monks, as a man of piety. Hume. less a bishop than a beast, Rebel against the crown; Rome too conspires, And launches all St. Peter's fiercest fires. With mournful indignation next I sing, The hapless, widow'd, persecuted King! His earthly crown he quits, on Heav'n relies, Invokes the spirit of his wife—and dies. “Pleas'd let me trifle life away, “And sing of love.” Hammond's Tibullus. “None but the brave deserve the fair.” Dryden. “Equal to both, and arm'd for either field.” Rowe. EDGAR THE PEACEABLE. Edgar encreas'd our navy—he was right, Tho', toujours prêt, he'd little cause to fight. Next, he obliged the Prince of Wales To pay three hundred wolves a year; Which, with three amatory tales, Is all that of his Majesty we hear. Whether these tales are worthy of perusal, Or, whether their contents are false or true, They wait acceptance or refusal, As may, my readers kind, seem good to you. LOVE TALE THE FIRST. Wilfrida Hume calls this lady Edita; she is, by another author named Wolfchild. was the fairest of the fair; So thought the King, for lovers think on stilts; Which made her parents, with most proper care, Immure her in a Nunnery of Wilts. (Whether 'twas Amesbury, where ancient Q Imported Nuns from France, I never knew.) King Edgar, living in such days as those, When Dunstan took the Devil by the nose, The Monks whom Dunstan and Edgar put in possession of Convents, were so nearly perfect, that they knew nothing of religion but continence and obedience. Ingulphus. Was doubtful in what manner to proceed. Now Dunstan and the Devil were not foes (But in appearance) for, tout autre chose, They help'd each other in the time of need. To Dunstan quoth Old Nick, “My plans 'twill aid, “If Edgar from yon abbey force the maid, “Then, prithee, brother Dunny, don't impede him.” Quoth Dunstan to Old Nick, “'Tis my design “To let him take her, then a glorious fine, “I'll levy first, and next the Pope shall bleed him.” In short, the Monarch took the Nun away, There was, in consequence, I scarce need say, The Devil and the Friar both to pay. LOVE TALE THE SECOND. At Andover with great applause A pair dwelt, sans rebuke; The wife a Duchess was, because The husband was a Duke! A lovely daughter eke had they, Well-favored, fair, and mild, They had no other, for folks say, She was an only child. King Edgar lov'd, King Edgar woo'd, You'll all allow, I ween, 'Twas grossierté, 'twas wrong, 'twas rude! For Edgar had a Queen. In vain he offered heaps of gold, In vain to work he went, More ways than we have yet been told, To win the maid's consent; When words, and sighs, and tears had fail'd, He feign'd him deadly sick, The Lady, since nought else prevail'd, Then play'd a King a trick. All in the dark she made believe, She'd grace the Monarch's bed, Then sent, nor did the Prince perceive, Another in her stead. At Highgate, I am much afraid. They ne'er had sworn his Grace, Else had he never let the Maid, Assume her Lady's place. Such shocking things Prove, modern Kings Are better than of yore; Which probably, Is reason why, Some folks abuse them more. LOVE TALE THE THIRD. Yet how dare I attempt to tell a story, Which Mason has related con amore? No matter, whether good or bad, my song, I'll promise this, shall not be very long. Elfrida with her father liv'd retired, Few eyes beheld her, yet, who saw, admired; And fame, of beauty ever prone to sing, Proclaim'd her modest merits to the King; Who, 'ere he credence gave, resolv'd to send, The truth to ascertain, a fancied friend. Who read my simple legend, ah, beware! Those are not always friends who say they are. When Athelwold beheld the beauteous maid Too soon his trust from Edgar was betray'd; With false report his master's ear abus'd, He weds the fair the cheated King refus'd; Triumph'd awhile in baseness and deceit, Nor fear'd the vengeance he was doom'd to meet. My legend who peruse, on this depend, Dishonest dealing ne'er meets happy end. The King by other favorites made wise, For favorites on fav'rites still are spies, Views his friend's treason in Elfrida's charms, Who flies from Athelwold to Edgar's arms: The faulty Earl is slain, and on the spot, Another abbey falls to Dunstan's lot.— The usual mode of compensation was resorted to, and a pile was raised in honour of a saint, to expiate the crime of murdering a sinner. So much for love!—the gallant King expires, And, scarcely he reposes with his sires, 'Ere fell Elfrida (like the Scottish Dame, Who fann'd Macbeth's ambitions flame,) Her sex forgot, her soul's repose disdain'd, With blood of deepest dye the empire stain'd. By way of Postcript, suffer me to add, The King his Magistrates with care inspected, The just rewarded; woe betide the bad! Whom neither rank, nor friends, nor place, protected. He taught the Clergy to reform their lives, Clergy who deem'd it wicked to have wives; And therefore openly “withouten shame,” Were kind to Ladies with another name. Edgar, and it was noble in the Prince, Made yearly circuits to discover Where pardon might reform and more convince Than punishment. Of Peace an ardent lover. Where more congenially cou'd Mercy rest, Than thus companion'd in a Monarch's breast? END OF PART THE SECOND. PART THE THIRD. From Edward the Martyr to the Norman Conquest. CONTENTS.

EDWARD THE MARTYR. From Radcliffe's ivy mantled towers, Where “foul deeds rise” in midnight gloom, To haunt guilt's wakeful, ling'ring hours, And warn the murd'rer of his doom; Lewis! from where thy spectres glide, And sable plumed assassins wait, Where malice, deck'd in monkish pride, Allures some victim to her fate; From, Fuseli! thy touch of fire, Enthusiastic, madly bold— Much aid my muse may well require, For fell a tale as e'er was told. Elfrida! had wild fiction's page Thy fiend-like outline dar'd to shew, This all enlighten'd critic age Had damn'd the lines that drew thee so! Reader! howe'er the hardy task My feeble pen may ill beseem, Your patience I shall boldly ask, While I attempt, to tell a Dream. Where mould'ring Corfe's antique remains Attract the passing trav'ler's eye, Recal the scene of former reigns, And tell of ages long gone by; With toil and thought my nerves unstrung, I woo'd repose; old Somnus smiled, The gale through moss clad fragments sung, And fancy thus my sense beguil'd: Methought the blast grew loud, and long, and keen, The barren heath grew dark, and wide, and drear, For shelter scarce a trembling leaf was seen, And direst noises mock'd th' uncertain ear! And now it seem'd as if the yell Of Evil Spirits, high in air, Mix'd with the winds, now, like the knell From some deep toned sepulchral bell, Or, as the ling'ring groan of sad despair, Upon the terror stricken heart it fell, Yet, what these sounds might bode no living man could tell. Ne'er did such fearful torrents leave the sky, Ne'er from such angry clouds did torrents pour, Ne'er did such light'ning paralize the eye, Nor ever thunder burst with such indignant roar. An hour so dread, a desert place so wild, Might well the stoutest, firmest, heart subdue, Convert the soul of manhood to a child, And with big drops the forehead pale bedew. Amid the countless wonders of the night, While sulph'rous flashes breaking o'er the scene Made “darkness visible,” my startled sight Beheld a female of majestic mien. Dark were her tresses which a blood-stained veil Confined, a diadem her temple bound, 'Twas more than terrible to hear her wail, Cold ran my heart's-blood at the mournful sound! “Guilty Elfrida!” was her ceaseless cry, The breast she beat gave back a hollow groan; “Guilty Elfrida!” echo made reply, And nature shook with horrors not her own. Of martyr'd Edward's step-dame 'twas the shade, (So fancy whisper'd to my fear-struck mind) Who, nightly thus compell'd, confession made, Yet from confession no relief might find. “Ambition!” shriek'd the form, “thou hateful name, “Thou worst of evils, cause of all my woe, “Not less corrosive thy detested flame “Than fires that scorch my guilty heart below! “Sage Peers, of my aspiring hopes aware, “Opposed me to protect my hapless son, “That son who should have been a mother's care, “Became her hate, and we were both undone. “Dunstan, Dunstan sided with (not from loyalty, but because he governed) the King, and opposed the unnatural and ambitious views of Elfrida, whose party was strong and headed by the Earl of Mercia. that sainted hypocrite, conspir'd “My royal name in disrepute to bring; “'Twas thirst of pow'r the daring Churchman fir'd, “I wish'd to rule a State, he ruled a King. “Four years my death-devoted step-son reign'd, “Beloved by most, but least beloved by me, “His virtue my too vicious aims restrain'd, “Who from restraint determined to be free. “Foremost of Cavaliers so gay “Who drove with “hound and horn” the game, “His train outstript, he came to pay “His duty to a parent's name. “Oh, then! what tortures equal mine “A heart to shew depraved as this! “Judas! my guilt is next to thine, “Betraying heaven with a kiss. “Youth, health, and exercise combined “With manly beauty deck'd his brow, “And locks in glossy ringlets twined “Might charm a vestal from her vow. “Yet could not these my heart disarm, “Yet cou'd not these my bosom sway, “I nerved the shrinking ruffian's arm “His monarch and my son to slay. “Should Infidels to direst foe “Once 'ope the hospitable door “The cup a pledge of faith they know, “They drink, and then are foes no more. “But I who stain'd a Christian name, “In the deceitful cup I gave, “Forgot my son, my sov'reign's claim, “And plung'd him in an early grave, “Yet on that day the sun shone bright, “(That day of most atrocious guilt!) “Which shou'd have been eclips'd in night, “Or redden'd like the blood I spilt. “The sparkling bev'rage from this hand “He took, and rais'd to drink, when lo! “A minion of my savage band “Struck deep the unexpected blow. “Struggling with death, he turn'd his steed, “And from me as he urged his way, “His parting glance the dreadful deed “Began already to repay. “Not long his hand the curb retains, “Vainly on absent friends he calls, “In faint contention with his pains, “Helpless, the martyr'd Edward falls. “Dragg'd by his courser's speed at length “O'er rudest roads and ways uneven, “He finds, while losing life and strength, “A sharp and thorny path to heaven. “And dare I name that place, forbid “To wretches, pure, compared with me? “Though plung'd in hell, my crime unhid “And unatoned must ever be. “To ev'ry pile my selfish care “Founded, The monasteries of Amesbury, Worwell, &amp;c. to compromise the deed, “My form must nightly now repair, “Again to see my Edward bleed. “And where, with mock religious zeal, “And downcast eye, my arms I cross'd, “I'm doom'd in genuine woe to feel “The blood I shed, the heaven I lost! Edward was canonized soon after, and ranked among the martyrs; because he had defended the cause of the monks, ejected the secular clergy from their bcnefices, and made Dunstan archbishop of Canterbury. Lockman. “And hark! a summons deep and drear, “Unlike each sound of mortal ken, “Warns me no more to linger here, “But hence, and count my crimes again.” And deep and drear the summons came, The spectre fled, the charm was broke, And (haply you may be the same), Right glad was I when I awoke. “As tedious as a King.” Shakespeare. “This Boy will turn out a Poltroon and a Coward.” St. Dunstan's Declaration at the Baptism of this Prince. “Il paroit Maitre de tout les autres Hommes: Mais il n'est pas Maitre de lui meme. On Voyoit plusieurs de ces Rois severement punis, non pour les Maux qu'ils avoient faits, mais pour avoir neglige le biens quils auroient du faire.” Fenelon. ETHELRED THE UNREADY. Little recorded in this reign we find But cowardice and cruelty combined; Denmark again her warlike fortune tries, And the “Norweyan banner flouts the skies;” The fearful King pays tribute to the Dane, Who partially retires; those who remain In treacherous massacre are basely slain. A full revenge th' unkingly act succeeds, And England in her every province bleeds; Prelates and Nobles in the ruin share, Nor sex nor age, the northern ruffians spare: Our seats of learning and its stores they burn, Nor quit us but to menace swift return. With Danish Olave came ambitious Sweyn, Who here obtained a momentary reign; And fell, as Dunstan's tonsured tribe advance, By spectred Edmund's The Monks reported that the spectre of Edmund, King of East Anglia, whose remains Sweyn had disturbed by laying the Abbey of Bury under military execution, fought under Duntan's banner. visionary lance; Canute, too, vainly hail'd our Albion's Lord, Sees Ethelred by Londoners restored; While gallant Edmund flies to aid his sire, And wake within his breast a noble fire; In vain the pious son his King wou'd save, Untaught by ills, to every vice a slave, The Monarch sinks to an inglorious grave. “Bellona's bridegroom.” Shakespeare. “'Twas valour taught the art of war, “To throw the lance and drive the car, “Taught the bold warrior how to die, “And bade the vanquish'd scorn to fly. “And valour's self, to roam no more, “Has come to Albion's white cliff'd shore.” Leigh Hunt. “We fought with swords! a brave man shrinks not at death! from my early youth I have learn'd to dye the steel of my lance in blood.” Mallet's Northern Antiquities. “How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!” 2 Samuel, chap. i. EDMUND IRONSIDE. Short was thy reign, thou gallant youth! Tho' famed for valour, worth, and truth; Thine unsuspicious soul ne'er thought, Man's honour could be sold or bought. And, trusting Edric's hollow guile, Edric, by stratagem most vile, In Sherstan's fight, with artful lie, Caus'd thine embattled ranks to fly. Edric, observing the Danes gave ground, raised the bleeding head of a soldier on the point of a spear, and cried aloud, “Haro, Haro, flee Englonde! dead is Edmunde!” He afterwards betrayed Edmund at the battle of Asandone, or Ashdon, in Essex. Yet keen thy sword, and strong thine arm, Which taught Canute to shrink from harm; And rather England's rule divide Than thy fierce prowess more abide: At Athelney, where single fight, Was arbiter of double right. Edmund perceiving Canute at the head of his forces, rode off from his own, and Canute advancing, a furious combat ensued, in which neither having much advantage, they agreed to divide the kingdom. The author of the Medulla Historiæ Anglicanæ, says, Canute was wounded and first proposed forbearance. Edmund, tho' soon thy race was run, Thy life immortal fame has won; Thy cruel death in endless shame Involves a hated traitor's name: For not a year thy reign had known, 'Ere murder mark'd thee for his own. Edric, cursed Edric closed thine eyes, And carried to Canute as prize Thy bleeding corse, requiring at his hand, Advancement o'er the Peerage of the land. Th' indignant King assented with a frown, And placed the traitor's head high o'er the regal town. So the Amalekite, who Saul had slain, Aspired from David rich reward to gain. So they who slew the King of Israel's Son, And deem'd the Royal Psalmist's favour won, Found retribution: such just guerdon be, In ev'ry age, the Meed of Treachery! DANISH SOVEREIGNS. “A little flattery sometimes does well.” Shakespeare. “Ely's Monks sang cheerfully, “When Canute the King was passing by; “‘Row to the shore, Knights,’ said the King, “‘And let us hear these Churchmen sing.’” Written by Canute.—Vide Sturt. CANUTE THE GREAT. Edmund by Edric thus unjustly slain, Britons are now sole “liegemen to the Dane;” Who, less by right than power of the sword, Of England, Denmark, Norway, is the Lord. Hence, servile courtiers as they bent the knee, Hail'd him great master of the land and sea; His better feeling courts th' unconscious waves, To roll reproof around his cringing slaves. The story of Canute's reproof of his flatterers, is too generally known to need insertion here. The Sons of Edmund most unjustly sent From their inheritance to banishment; Seek Sweden's aid in vain, and, after, found, A kind asylum on Hungarian ground. Canute in four the British state divides, And Dane and Englishman in turn presides; Olaus, of Norway, next his arms subdue, And Scottish Malcolm pays the tribute due. A. D. 1036. A tribute levied by the Danish invaders on the English, in arrear for several preceding reigns, and called Danegelt. A splendid pilgrimage to Rome he takes, And needless homage to the Pontiff makes. Rebuilt the Abbey, which his sire destroy'd At Bury, hence new wealth the Monks enjoyed. To appease Old Edgar Ath'ling's spirit, Vide the reign of Ethelred the Second, page 105. who, So legends tell, Canute's great father slew. As (Pallas taught) Idomeneus of Crete Gave to the useful arts protection meet; Some wholsome laws the British Monarch made, Encouraged genius, and assisted trade. It has been said, that, “Like Augustus, he “Shou'd never have been born.” We also see In the same sentence it has been replied, That, “being born, he never shou'd have died.” Unjustly tho' the English crown he gain'd, Few subjects of his Government complain'd; Who, finally, to all his people proved A Sovereign respected, and beloved. “Nought hath he done for us and nought deserved.” Voltaire. “En vain, du sang des Rois, dont je suis l'oppresseur, “Les peuples abusés m'ont cru le défenseur, “De quinze ans de travaux j'ai perdu tout le fruit. “Croi moi, ces préjugés de sang et de naissance “Revivront dans les cœurs, y prendront sa defense.” Ibidem. “In vain have I oppressed the blood of Kings, whilst the deluded people adored me as their friend, if yet there lives a hateful offspring, all the prejudice of birth and blood revives.” Smollet's Voltaire. HAROLD HAREFOOT. By mutual accord, it was decreed, Hardicanute his father should succeed; But absence seldom helps the claim of right, And Harold, in fraternal honour's spite, Usurp'd the Crown.—His reign was short, and these, Some of his acts, are little fram'd to please; Mixture of insignificance and pride, (Proud to love walking better than to ride. Hence his surname of Harefoot.) To narrowness of soul he added guilt, And caus'd the blood of Alfred to be spilt. Alfred, (of Edmund Ironside the Son,) Who cross'd the seas, by Harold's treachery won. Well may my reader tire of tasteless rhymes, Which but repeat a catalogue of crimes; But faithful narrative must be content With fact, nor seek for bland embellishment. Else had some episode or harmless joke Your present comfortable slumbers broke. Edward, the brother of the Prince who fell, Escap'd the snare, and 'twill be ours to tell Hereafter of his fate; it now remains, That Hardic'nute a pow'rful army gains, Against King Harold to assert his right; But, while the doubtful issue of the fight Depends, the reigning Monarch yields his breath, And civil strife is ended by his death. Earl Godwin, lord of the once fertile land Where many a bark now moulders in the sand; First flourish'd in this reign, and by his aid, The selfish King his brother's right betray'd. “They call me a foul-feeder.” Shakespeare. “There's no bottom, none “In my voluptuousness. Ibid. HARDICANUTE. To each unprincely appetite inclined, Hardy in form, but imbecile in mind; Two years (too long) he reign'd, when at a feast The tyrant died, as he had lived, a beast. A surfeit stopp'd the sensual Caitiff's breath, And merry England celebrates his death. Hogstide the anniversary they call Of that good day which saw the glutton fall. During his life, his brother from the grave He dragg'd, and gave his body to the wave; The wave rejects it, and fraternal crime, Disturbs the hapless corse a second time. Earl Godwin joins with sacrilegious hand, To hurl dead Harold from the shelt'ring land. None of the names of these tools of a tyrant's caprice have escaped posterity. The diggers up of Harold are known to have been—Alfric, Archbishop of York; Earl Godwin; Styr, the steward; Edric, the sewer; and Troudle, the executioner. J. P. Andrews. Godwin, who, when Prince Edward dares to call, To answer for young Alfred's timeless fall; With venal off'ring of a splendid barge Buys from the shameless King his crime's discharge. The Danegelt next provokes the subjects' ire, Whose 'plaints are answer'd but with sword and fire; In fine, tho' brief, from crime this reign appears In two-and-twenty lines as many years. THE SAXON LINE RESTORED. “How he solicits Heaven “Himself best knows, but strangely visited people, “The mere despair of surgery, he cures, “Hanging a golden stamp about their necks, “Put on with holy pray'rs:—With this strange virtue, “He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy; “And sundry blessings hang about his throne “That speak him full of grace.” Shakespeare. EDWARD THE CONFESSOR. Whether King Edward own'd the powers Our Bard immortal speaks of, is not our's To canvass.—'Tis our province to set down Sans comment, what, it was supposed the Crown Did, or had pow'r to do.—Of Danegelt eas'd, The subjects with the sovereign were pleas'd; And gave him equally deserv'd applause, For well digested and impartial laws. What sad procession meets the eye? Why trickles that reluctant tear From chiefs who pass in order by, What sounds of woe salute the ear? The solemn Pibrochs mournful tone Which marks the step of yonder band Proclaim that Scotia's legal throne Is stain'd by an usurper's hand. And Edward lends his ready aid, And Siward leads a valiant train; Who, by the tyrant undismay'd, Replace the son of Duncan slain. The swan of Avon knew full well To touch each chord that thrills the heart; Then let his magic numbers tell Of murd'rous guile and fiend-like art. The blasted heath, the wizard crew, The “unsex'd” wife of Glamis' Thane, Whose trait'rous hand his master slew, And earn'd a transitory reign. Whate'er his skill, who says or sings, This moral he can only shew, That crowns are but uncertain things, And, (or in Subjects, or in Kings,) Error must surely end in woe. For proofs that mortal saints are sometimes weak, With little trouble, in this reign, we seek; His breast was coldly fraught with filial love, Who cou'd, remorseless, cause his mother prove The fire ordeal. Next, for having wed A child of one he had good cause to dread; The coward Prince revenged upon the dame That hate he dared not for her sire proclaim. Godwin, ambition's child, the scourge we're told Of worthier men, “saucy and over bold” In state affairs.—Revengeful, cruel, proud, When least he deem'd—to fate's stern summons bow'd. 'Tis said denial of Prince Alfred's death By his connivance, stopt the murd'rer's breath. Legends report that Godwin was supernaturally suffocated, immediately subsequent to a solemn declaration of his innocence respecting the Prince's murder. 'Twas Edward's wish, when dying, to resign The regal chair to Norman William's line; But, while deliberation held the beam, The king of terrors closed each worldly dream; Harold, Earl Godwin's son, assumed the sway, With what success a future page must say. “'Twas party deceit, “Help'd the Normans to beat, “Of traitors they managed to buy land; “Pict, Saxon, or Dane, “Had assail'd us in vain, “While true to the king of the island. “Brave Harold fought hard for the island, “He lost both his life and the island; “And the records of fame `Shall add to his name, “Like a Briton he died for his island.” T. Dibdin's Songs. HAROLD THE SECOND. The truth demands, yet we record with pain, How brief the honours of this short liv'd reign. Crowns take some value from a nation's voice, And Harold was, 'tis said, the people's choice: Harold, (the son of Godwin,) who proclaim'd That he by Edward was successor named; William, the Duke of Normandy, declares, The same pretence; and these two self-named heirs, Alike, rejecting each the other's word, Refer decision to the sharpest sword; Mean time, as oft the muse of hist'ry sings, The subjects suffer for contending Kings. William 'ere yet his fortune he essayed, With Norway's chief, and Harold's brother made A league that they should first the isle invade; Their early efforts with success were crown'd, And British men gave way on British ground. Northumberland and Mercia's Earls were beat, But Harold's arm so well that loss redeem'd That neither of his foes surviv'd defeat. And victory in mercy's smile was drest, The last, last time she beam'd, On hapless Harold's crest. To Norway's son the King allow'd retreat, And greatly gave him back his father's captive fleet. But whose the ships afar descried, Reflected by the glassy tide, Where chiefs in arms refulgent ride, Our fears exciting? 'Tis Norman William and his band, Near, and more near, they make the land! And who their prowess shall withstand, For England fighting? Mark! high exalted o'er the rest, Where Baieux' Bishop proudly drest, Blesses the crew with hands unblest, To blood inviting! They land! To earth see mail-clad William falls, His troops the omen not appals; Turf, and the cotter's thatch, his warriors bring, As seizen of the soil, and hail the invader, King. What knight, in breast-plate wrought with gold, Marshals yon troop of bowmen bold, Who land in numbers yet untold, Each other chearing? 'Tis Aimar, with good reason vain Of troops he leads from Acquitain, Each knight of whom some peer has slain, No foeman fearing. And there, a thousand men at arms Fitz-Osborn's shrill-toned clarion charms, While every echoing blast alarms Our startled hearing. The deep drum rolls, and, as the threat'ning throng, Beneath their frowning banners move along, The shore resounds with Rollo's martial song. De Beaumont, Lacy, Pevrel, each an host, (The noblest warriors from the Norman coast) D'Evreux, Fitz-Richard, with that chieftain famed, Charles Martel, and (too num'rous to be named) Longueville, De Thours, Grantmesnil, and Mortaigne, De Estaples, Warrean, Giffard, and a train, With Eustace de Boulogne of men renowned. And, hark again the drum, and hark the trumpet's sound! Forward they march, and now, from William sent, A Norman herald seeks the royal tent; There fiercely throws his master's gauntlet down, Who proffers single combat for the crown. Harold with stern disdain the pledge denies, And on his people's love, and heav'n's high aid, relies. Yet why before the arbitrative day, Expectant of the fight, Did Britons pass the night In song unseemly and carousal gay? While to the sacred pow'r that rules the skies, Unnumber'd Norman prayers and praises rise. 'Tis dawn!—'Tis day! once more the trumpet's throat Brays bold defiance—who can tell What numbers in its dreadful note Have heard their dying knell? No thund'ring cannon here the field affrights, But from a thousand chosen knights The Norman bowstring's fatal twang Echoed by groans responsive rang. Not there with simultaneous sound The well-timed musquetry is found; But on the glitt'ring ranks, On iron helms the falling iron clanks, And cleaves through shiver'd mail with dreadful wound. Not there, as late on Maida's plains, The British bayonet the palm obtains; But sturdy pikemen pierce th' embattled field, And bear to earth who bears th' opposing shield. The English bill, dread weapon, hews it way, And Harold's valour almost claims the day. Three foaming coursers under William slain Add blood to blood on the ensanguined plain: The Duke undaunted, “dares again the field,” The dauntless monarch scorns alike to yield; His loyal soldiers gallantly contend, While Norman hopes of conquest nearly end; The Kentish phalanx ev'ry onset dares, And fierce invasion pauses and despairs. O, stratagem! in war, as love, allow'd, Too oft thy keen-brain'd cunning foils the brave; Too oft his living laurels charm the crowd, Who vanquish'd, but for thee, had found a grave. While fortune, and while justice in the scale, Alternately our hopes and fears divide: While justice seems a moment to prevail, See fortune turn, by artifice, the tide. The foe before the English force retreat, The English follow to unlook'd defeat; For suddenly the wily band returns, The fray renew'd with ten-fold fury burns. Again the spear, the battle-axe, the bow, Destroy the van, and lay the distant low! The British, late of victory secure, Outwitted thus, the contest scarce endure. But Harold, Harold, now supremely great, Proudly superior to thy savage fate; Once, twice, and thrice, from rank to rank he flew, Once, twice, and thrice, his ranks the fight renew. Again he leads 'em with resistless rage, Again a fruitless war the Normans wage; Another onset ends the doubtful strife, He leads, he falls, and loses but his life! His crown he never lost, who, unsurpast, Maintain'd it like a Briton, to the last. While hand to hand death threaten'd him in vain, The shaft accurs'd that pierc'd his royal brain Left William less a victor than the slain. Ill-fame betide the coward hand that drew The fatal string, and such an hero slew. Two gallant brothers Gurth and Leofwin. fighting by his side, Thousands of faithful hearts, their leader's pride, His patriot laurels with his fate divide. Peace to their manes! cou'd th' unequal pen But justly celebrate the glorious men; The Poet's lay a deathless fame shou'd raise, And deeds immortal meet immortal praise. END OF PART THE THIRD.

The Curfew tolls the knell of Danish sway, The British Chiefs their arms reluctant yield, The soldiers homeward march their weary way, And leave to William the disputed field! Now fades each gleam of freedom on the sight, And ev'ry Englishman is doom'd a slave, Save those who nobly perish'd in the fight, And sunk unconquer'd to a patriot grave. Save Gurth and Le'fwin to their brother true, Who shared with Harold that disastrous hour, Save Morcar, Edwin, and a loyal few, Who lived to combat oft the victor's power. Beneath those ruin'd walls Battel Abbey, in Sussex, where bones are yet to be seen piled up, supposed to be those of the fallen in that memorable fight. that ivy's shade, Where whitening bones in sad promiscuous heap, Unseemly to the trav'ler's eye are laid, The gallant victims of the battle sleep. The hollow drum at incense-breathing morn, No more resounding thro' the tented shed, The warlike clarion, or the echoing horn, No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed. For them no more shall royal Harold show'r Reward for loyalty and val'rous deed, No lady fair awaits them in the bower, To pay with beauty's smile the warrior's meed. Oft did invaders to their prowess yield, Their biting bills full many a helm have broke, How loudly rang their anlace on the shield, How bow'd the foe beneath their sturdy stroke! Let not the modern soldier mock their toil Who, cased in iron, trod th' ensanguined plain, Nor light-arm'd cavalry at heroes smile Whose mail-clad steeds still answer'd to the reign. The rich pelisse, the gorgeous epaulette, The tube destructive, and the sabre brave, Can only pay the same much honoured debt, The paths of glory lead but to the grave. Nor men of wealth impute to these the blame, No marble monument, with studied lays, At Paul's or Peter's consecrates their fame, While nasal organ'd vergers chaunt their praise. Cou'd Praxiteles, were he now alive, Cou'd famed Pygmalyon, or Promethean lore, Cou'd Roubilliac's or Bacon's art revive, The daring chiefs who fell to rise no more? Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid Some head, once fraught with diplomatic fire, Hands that Calcutta's sceptre might have sway'd, And brought from India many a rich Jaghire. But commerce to their eyes her figur'd page, Rich with a Nabob's spoil, did ne'er unroll, No navy seconded advent'rous rage, To barter wealth “from Indus to the Pole.” Full many a mind with force to guide a storm, Or politics, or trade, must think alone; Full many a heart of valour's boldest form Is doom'd to wither in the ranks unknown. Some Abercrombie who, with dauntless breast, Aggressing Gaul had chaced from Egypt's shore; Some Marlbro', Wolfe, Cornwallis, here may rest, A Smith, a Stuart, Wellington, or Moore. The thanks of British Senates to command, The threats of Gaul's Colossus to despise, To fight for freedom in Iberia's land, And raise our fame in Lusitania's eyes. Their lot forbad, nor circumscribed alone Their growing virtue's but their crimes confin'd, Forbade to wade thro' blood to Gallia's throne, And shut the gates of freedom on mankind. The struggling pangs of murder'd truth to hide, To quench the useful ardor of the press, To heap the shrine of self-created pride With honours which but make the wearer less. Far from subverting an establish'd throne, Such modern doctrines were by them denied, They'd hands and hearts to combat for their own, And for their sov'reign's rights they fought and died. Yet e'en these bones which grave nor tomb protect, Nor sculptured arts, with letter'd graces vie, Oft shall the feeling passer by reflect, And pay their patriot virtue with a sigh. For who to dumb forgetfulness a prey But thinks on him whose patriotic mind Can for his country cast his life away, Tho' mindful of the friends he leaves behind. Nor name, nor years, sung by the loftiest muse, Cou'd praise to equal their desert supply, Who, scorning Norman William, dared refuse To yield, and for that bold refusal die. For William, bane of those most honour'd dead, Few are the lines that may his tale relate, A life of warfare in his reign he led, His sons, and Harold's sons, still cross'd his fate. And foreign wars he waged, and built the Tow'r, And caus'd our laws the Norman tongue to speak, And tax'd poor devils who were in his power, And help'd the strong to triumph o'er the weak. The Exchequer first at Westminster he placed, Next, to secure of hunting ground a stock, New forest for his pleasure he laid waste, And made folks go to bed at eight o'clock. At Mantes, to burn a town it was his will, His horse took fright, Will pull'd him up in vain, And, or he died, or was used very ill, For certainly they buried him at Caen. There, at due stated periods of the year, Were requiems and masses sung and said, And little choristers oft warbled there, As choristers will do when they are paid. Around his tomb they march in sad array, Where is an Epitaph inscribed most fair, Whether the following, I dare not say, Because I own, I never saw it there. The EPITAPH. Here rests his head upon its native earth A Prince to fame and fortune greatly known, Of high ambition, tho' of doubtful birth, Albion he saw, and mark'd her for his own. Large was his army, numerous his fleet, Fate did commensurate success send down, He gave to Harold a severe defeat, He gain'd from victory, all he wish'd, a crown. No farther seek his merits to disclose, Or on a conqueror's faults too nicely look, He'll find, when waking from the tomb's repose, His sentence is inscribed in doomsday-book. Doomsday-book, is a register now extant, of all landed possessions, introduced among the feudal regulations by the Conqueror. “And that Red King, who, while of old “Through Boldrewood the chase he led, “By his loved huntsman's arrow bled.” Walter Scott. “Too low for a high praise, and too little for a great praise.” Shakespeare. “So, so is good, very good, very excellent good, and yet it is not, it is but so so.” Shakespeare. WILLIAM RUFUS. King William Rufus wore red hair, Was rather short, and very fat, His eyes, we're told, were not a pair, Yet who could blame the King for that? His brother Robert claim'd a right To reign, which Bishop Odo aided, But when they were both beat in fight, One fled, and t'other was degraded. The holy war, by zealots led, Began, and much the muse it irks, That Infidels like Christians bled, And Christian soldiers fought like Turks. Westminster Hall King William rear'd, When finish'd swore in princely huff, The fabrick to his eyes appear'd Not half-a-quarter large enough. The author hopes he has not exceeded the reported character of William's coarseness and vulgarity.—When ten Englishmen had been cleared by the ordeal of fire, for the charge of killing dear, Rufus exclaimed, “Pretty justice above, indeed, to let “ten such scoundrels escape!” J.P. Andrews. Yet William exhibited a mixture of firmness and naivete, when a pilot was fearful of embarking with him on an expedition in tempestuous weather; the Monarch asked, “whether he had ever heard of a King being drowned.” The sea, which, as Canute had shown, Respects nor wealth, nor rank, nor pow'r, O'erflowed Earl Godwin's land, since known As Goodwin Quicksands, to this hour. New Forest, which the conqu'ror meant For sport, was of his son the bane, There by a shaft, which chance missent, In prime of life was Rufus slain. Here too, his brother and his nephew fell, By darts dispatch'd from undiscovered hand, Which folks around, as fearful judgments tell, On those, who for the chace despoil'd the poor man's land. Nor much lamented was the Norman King, Whose people were in most reduced condition; His Ministers had tax'd each sort of thing, For there were then no Whigs in opposition. Of his attire the Sov'reign took due heed, As you shall learn from ancient lines annex'd, Robert of Glo'ster scripsit what you'll read, Tho' Camden rather modernized the text. Poetry of the Year 1098. Which the author of the Medulla Historia Anglicanæ calleth “a pretty passage.” [“His Chamberlain him brought, as he rose on a day] “His Chamberlain him brought, as he rose on a day, “A morrow for to wear, a pair of hose of say; “He ask'd what they costen'd? “Three shillings,” he said, “Fie a dible,” quoth the King, “to say so vile a deed, “King's to wear so vile a cloths, that costened no more! “Buy a pair for a marke, or thou shall reu it sore.” “A worse pair, sure enough, the other him brought, “And said they costened a marke—Unneath he then bought; “Aye!—Bel-ami,” quoth the King, “these are well bought; “In this manner serve me, otherwise serve me not.” “But who shall teach my harp to gain “A sound of the romantic strain “Whose Anglo-Norman tones while're “Cou'd win the royal Henry's ear. “Famed Beauclere call'd, for that he loved, “The minstrel, and his lay approved.” Walter Scott. “For learning is better than house or land.” School Boy's Poetry. “Henry was called ‘Beauclerc,’ from his attention to learning, he had heard his father say, that ‘Illiterate Kings were little better than crowned asses,” and determined not to come under that description.” Camden. HENRY BEAUCLERC. Of Henry's learning, and the wise reform, He in the royal houshold made,—nay more, Abolish'd nightly curfew bells that rung Throughout the land of Albion, and deranged At early hour the interesting chat Of lovers just affianc'd—or of friends, Who, brought to council by the hope of gain On trade, were speculating hundreds deep; Or learned clerks, in disquisition grave, By classic lamps; or poets, poor as we, Condemn'd to rhyme for ways and means to eat; Sing, muse historic—Widows too, we learn, By his command have jointures, and are free To marry as they list, and marry did, Merely to shew the loyal reverence They bore the King's behest.—The laws 'erst made By the Confessor Edward were restored By Henry, who, to please the English, wed With Maud, descendant of the Scottish King, And Edgar Ath'ling's sister. Queen Maud, or Matilda, was the delight of the English, both on account of her descent and goodness of heart. To her we owe the first stone arched bridges England ever possessed:— she built two at Stratford, in Essex, (thence called De Arcubus, or Le Bow,) where she had nearly been drowned for want of such a convenience. What follows is part of an eulogy on her, preserved by Camden:Prospera non lætam facere, nec aspera tristem, Prospera terror ei, aspera risus erant, Non decor efficit fragilem non sceptra superbam Sola potens humilis, sola Pudica decens. Imitated. By woes her mind was near cast down, Nor by success beguiled, She met good fortune with a frown, At fortune's frowns she smiled: Where shall we find a Queen with this to pair, Tho' sceptred, humble—chaste, tho' great and fair? J.P. Andrews.—At this time King Henry's Brother Robert claim'd the crown, And from the Holy Land return'd with troops His fancied right to aid—subdued, forgiven, And set at liberty, again he fights Against his brother; captive ta'en, and sent To Cardiff, whence, in vain, he tries escape, And, first deprived of sight, soon finds a grave; Glo'ster Cathedral holds the Duke's remains, Encag'd in trellis'd iron. Heart of Oak Supplies a figure, armed cap-a-pie, But such as modern warriors would disdain, And ladies' ridicule on gay parade. Lewis, of France, invades the Norman lands, Him Henry meets, and quells th' invading King. But when returning, mournful is the tale, Prince William, Beauclerc's son, a splendid train Of Knights and Nobles, with the Princess Maud, And many worthies perish'd in the waves! And when to Normandy the King return'd, By (not habitual) intemp'rance, he Met also with his death. He was interred At Reading Abbey, which his zeal endow'd. Twice did he wed—his second Queen, the child Of Godfrey, of Loraine. In time of dearth (From April till the harvest time,) he fed Ten thousand of his Norman subjects,—built, In Oxfordshire, famed Woodstock Palace, which Still bears the stamp of his munificence. Yet will the liberal minded mourn to hear That, having ta'en in war a hapless bard, Who in some paltry measures (like to mine,) Had ridiculed his greatness, his revenge, (Tho' Sov'reigns for the poet pleaded hard,) Depriv'd the wretched captive of his eyes, Whose agony ensuing caus'd his death. “No, no,” said the irritated King to a great foreign Prince who interceded for the wretched poet, “for this man being forsooth a Wit, a Bard, and a Minstrel, hath composed many indecent songs against me, and moreover hath sung them openly to the great entertainment of my enemies. Now, since it hath pleased God to deliver him into my hands, he shall be punished to deter others from the like petulance.” So the sentence took place, and the imprudent poet died of the wounds he receiv'd in struggling with the executioner. Ordericus Vitelis.—Vide Andrews. Henry Beauclerc, of all our British Kings, Shou'd have respected the proud name he bore, Nor by inordinate and mean revenge, Have own'd the poet's satyre had its force. In this King's reign a house of monks first gave The Dunmow Charter, which entitles those Who live in wedlock, sans debate, one year To a fine flitch of bacon—one blest pair Ask'd and obtained it; and about that time, Thames water fail'd, the river bed was dry, Men, women, children, walked across where now Stands London Bridge—This and the happy two Who gain'd the Dunmow Flitch, astonish'd much The gaping vulgar, and we hav'nt heard That either prodigy occur'd again. A Muse, cotemporary with the King By way of Elegy, thus chose to sing. Poetry of the Year 1135. [King Henry is ded! bewty of the world] King Henry is ded! bewty of the world, For whom is grete dole; The Goddes now maken room for their kind brother, For he is Sole. Mercurius in speech, Marce in battayle, In hest strong Appollo; Jupiter in hest, Hest—Command. egall with Saturn, And enemie to Cupido; King he was a right, And man of most myght, And glorious in rayninge. And when he left his crowne Then fell honour down, For misse of such a King; Normandy then gan Lowre, For loss of their flowre, And sange wel-a-way! Englond made mone, And Scotland did grone, For to see that day! Vide “The Muse's Library.” “King Stephen was a worthy Peer.” Old Ballads. “A fellow of infinite jest.” Shakespeare. “Stephen was a man of great facetiousness, and much of his success is to be imputed to the familiar pleasantry of his conversation.” William of Malmsbury. “Since they have made me their King,” said the gallant Stephen, “why do they now forsake me? By the birth of “God I will not be called an abdicated Monarch.” Ibidem.—Vide J. P. Andrews. STEPHEN. Brave to a fault, of humour fair and free, Yet his possession of Old England's Throne, Was a faux pas, since reasons strong there be, To prove the property was not his own. The daughter of King Henry, Maud by name, Maud, or Matilda, first married the Emperor Henry IV. and afterwards Geoffry Plantagenet, Earl of Anjou, by whom she had King Henry II. of England. (Matilda, ladies, sounds more sweet, I ween,) Was heiress—and King Stephen, to his shame, Had sworn allegiance to her as his Queen. Not that I blame the Monarch for his oath, 'Twas merely common honesty to take it, But every gentleman should be right loath Having an affidavit made to break it. Much in this fashion too Matilda thought, Whose reasons were so back'd with horse and foot, That tho', while axe and sword were good, he fought, It was in this battle Stephen used the words above quoted. He lost his liberty and crown to boot. But “fortune de la guerre” is quick in change, Stephen was freed, and Maud forced to be off in (Conveyance for a living Queen most strange,) Not coach or chariot, but a screw'd up coffin. Several historians represent a coffin as the vehicle in which the Empress was reduced to make her escape. In strains of Scott we next declare, How “Scotland's dauntless King and Heir, “(Although with them they led “Galwegians, wild as ocean's gale, “And Lodon's Knights, all sheath'd in mail, “And the bold men of Teviotdale,) “Before his standard fled.” This was attributed by the superstition of the times (when David I. with his son Henry, invaded Northumberland, in 1136,) to the holy banner of St. Cuthbert, under which the English marched, and owed to its efficacy the great victory they obtained in the bloody battle of Northallerton, or Arton Moor. Vide Margerion, Notes to Canto II. Next came Plantagenet (Matilda's son), To make essay for what his mother won; But England's Monarch kept the youth at bay, Till Eustace, Stephen's hope and heir, (Death shews for princes little care,) Was from the scene of warfare snatch'd away. Then, and you wo'nt imagine him unwise, King Stephen, to conclude the strife, With his opponent made this compromise, He was to wear the crown while he had life, Mean time young Henry swore to keep the peace, And take the sceptre at the King's decease. Nor did he long survive.—For nineteen years But little in this reign appears, Save contests sung of—and that Chiefs had leave, Often in law's despite, To build strong castles, and bereave, By force and arms, the poor man of his right. The Canon law, cotemporaries say, First in this reign, to England found its way. Stephen's remains at Faversham inurn'd, Remain'd until, disgrace upon their names, Reformers, who dug up, pull'd down, and burn'd, Threw the once valiant Sov'reign in the Thames; With sacrilegious hands profaned the dead, For paltry plunder of his coffin'd lead. LINE OF PLANTAGENET; OR THE HOUSE OF ANJOU. “With thee, Plantagenet, from civil broils “The land awhile respired, and all was peace. “Then Becket rose, and impotent of mind, “Bid murd'rous priests the sov'reign frown contemn, “And, with unhallow'd crosier, bruised the crown. “Yet yielded not supinely tame a prince “Of Henry's virtues, learn'd, courageous, wise, “Of fair ambition.” Shenstone. “Still must that tongue some wounding message bring, “And still thy priestly pride provoke thy King; “For this are ‘foreign oracles’ explored, “To teach the land to murmur at its lord.” Vide Pope's Homer. (FAIR ROSAMOND.) “A maid unmatch'd in manners as in face, “Skill'd in each art, and crown'd with ev'ry grace; “Not half so dear were wedded ‘Ellen's’ charms, “When first her blooming beauties met my arms.” Ibidem. “The tempest in my mind “Doth from my senses take all feeling else, “Save what beats there.—Filial ingratitude!” Shakespeare. HENRY THE SECOND. Throughout his day much sorrow Henry prov'd, Cross'd in his pow'r by those whom most he lov'd; A constant warfare was his reign on earth, By sons fomented, who disgraced their birth; His Queen too, (tho' tis said much cause was hers To doubt his faith, yet story often errs), Join'd to oppose her husband and her lord, And lift against his crown rebellion's sword! Becket, another curse of Henry's life, Adds to the foes he found in sons and wife; Becket, the kingdom's bane, the popedom's glory, With temper scarcely I relate the story, A proof, since told ye in most homely fashion, We can do nothing well, when in a passion. A NEW LEGEND OF ST. THOMAS A BECKET. King Henry and the realm to spite, St. Dunstan being dead and gone, Some evil genius sent his sprite, In Becket's form, to curb the throne. Archbishop, Chancellor, and more Than I can say in these brief rhymes, He gain'd all Dunstan gain'd before, All Wolsey got in after times. And what return to Henry made This upstart, who deserv'd a rope? Of dignity he form'd a trade, And sold his master to the Pope! Rebellion into exile sent The meddling Monk, who yet return'd More honour'd, tho' much less content, While treason in his heart still burn'd. Repeated insult Henry drove Some hint to drop in angry mood, “Is there not one of the crew of lazy, cowardly knights, whom I maintain, that will rid me of this turbulent priest, who came to court but t'other day on a lame horse, with nothing but his wallet behind him?” These words unfortunately animated to action Reginal Fitz-urse, William de Tracey, Hugh de Morvil, and Richard Brito. Berington's Life of St. Thomas a Becket. The vulgar of Glocestershire have proverbially assigned a whimsical punishment for one of the families concerned in the assassination, thus:“The Tracies, “Have always the wind in their faces.” James Petit Andrews sportively adds, “No very severe judgment on a summer's day.” Which caus'd, who heard their zeal to prove, Unhappily, in Becket's blood. The King to penance keen and sore, And public ignominious pain, Submitted! ne'er was Prince before So humble, nor is like to be again. Had but the justice of the land, For which too oft he'd given cause, Struck Becket with a legal hand, Instead of shame the King had gain'd applause. His ill-bred haughtiness was such, that when the English prelates, in one body, represented to him the consequences which must inevitably attend his turbulent obstinacy, he answered only, “I hear you.” Nothing could exceed his pride, or the splendor of his household. Before his advancement to the primacy he had been used to travel attended by two hundred knights and other gay domestics: eight waggons were in his suite, two of those bore his ale, three the furniture of his chapel, of his bed-chamber, and of his kitchen, and the other three carried provisions and necessaries. Twelve pack-horses bore his money, plate, &amp;c. to each waggon was chained a fierce mastiff, and on each pack-horse there sat a baboon. The following Epitaph, among others, was made on Becket:Quis moritur? Præsul. Cur? Pro grege. Qualiter? Ense. Quando? Natali. Quis locus? Ara dei. Imitated by J. P. Andrews. Who's slain? The Primate. How? In dire affray. Why? For his flock. When? On his natal day. Say where? 'Twas where we kneel to heaven and pray. Ireland and Wales and Scotland pay Their homage to the King, whose prosp'rous day, Shorten'd by civil jars, And most unnatural wars, In unenjoy'd possession, dies away. Henry, his son, was by his father crown'd, As England's King, an early death he found. At this coronation, young Henry, on his father's humility being pointed out, arrogantly replied, “A great honour truly, for the son of a King to be waited on by the son of an Earl!” At other times too, he requited his father's tenderness with most unfilial ingratitude, a sense of which, is said, at length to have broken his own heart. His body was carried towards Roan, but the clergy and citizens of Mans took it by force and interred it in their cathedral, near the Old Geoffry Plantagenet, whence it was ultimately taken and re-interred at Roan. King Henry, in allusion to the ingratitude of his sons, had an allegorical picture painted for his palace at Windsor, representing an old eagle, his young ones fighting with him, and one scarcely fledged striving to peck out his eyes; the last he used to say was John, whom he loved best of all. Giraldus Cambrensis. Jeffery and William too, the latter died A child,—the former fell in martial pride. Richard and John succeeded to the throne In turn,—with shame the Muse makes known, That Richard, who with Gallia's King took part, His sire subduing, broke a parent's heart. A story told of Woodstock bow'r, I wis, I might be deem'd neglectful did I miss, Whether correct, or but by fancy penn'd, My humble tale your leisure doth attend. ROSAMOND's BOWER. A PARODY. THE ARGUMENT. “Henry the Second keepeth (with much care,) “Lord Cliffor'ds daughter, Rosamond the faire; “And whilst his sonnes do Normandy invade “He, forced to France, with wond'rous cost hath made “A labyrinthe in Woodstocke, where unseene “His love might lodge safe from his iealous queene.” Drayton. I Embow'r'd sat a lover and lady so gay, Where jas'mine with lilies were curl'd, They gaz'd on each other with tender delight; The warrior was Harry Plantagenet hight, And the lady the Rose of the World.

III “Oh, hush these suspicions,” Plantagenet said, “Offensive to Ellen and me, “For if she, by anger or jealousy led, “Should alarm you, while I am abroad, by my head, “Who's at home, The phrase of letting a person know “Who's at home,” has (unless the oustom is very much out,) since obtained considerably in domestic circles.

RICHARD CŒUR DE LION. O, gallant Prince! who loved to roam, When you had better stay'd at home; Whose subjects at thy crowning slew Many an unoffending Jew. Who conquer'd Cyprus, which denied A lodging to yourself and bride, (For on his road to Holy Land, He stopp'd to win a lady's hand,) Who 'gainst the Turks flew in a passion, Because just then it was the fashion.

All chearfully obeyed, except the Duke of Austria, who sent word that his father having been neither bricklayer nor mason, he had not learned either business. The English King hearing this insolent speech repeated to his face by the haughty Duke, “cum pede percussit” Anglice kicked him out of his tent, and ordered his banner to be disgraced. Brompton. Who found, returning, to thy cost, The mem'ry of that kick not lost, And was by Austria's lads surrounded, And 'till great ransom paid, impounded. Or, as your Troubadour King Richard was a passionate lover of poetry, and bears a rank among the Provencal Poets or Troubadours, who were the first of the modern Europeans that distinguished themselves by attempts of that nature. Hume. Crescimbini, in his Commentary on the Lives of the Provencal Poets, says that Richard composed a sonnet which he sent to Princess Stephanetta, wife of Hugh de Baux, and other sonnets, while a prisoner, which he sent to Beatrix, Count of Provence; the whole of one the latter productions is given in the Catalogue of Royal Authors, one or two verses will be sufficient here to give an idea of the supposed softness of the Provencal dialect.

O, gallant Prince! such store of deeds To tell, my pen must mending needs, Therefore I only, valiant King, Have set down what I wish'd to sing; For in thy reign, I'm told, a bard Found it a subject keen and hard, And much was forced his brain to tax, Even to sing thy battle axe, With all its murd'rous hews and hacks. This version shall conclude my page, And shew the genius of thy age. SPECIMEN of POETRY, IN THE YEAR 1190.

JOHN. At length a dawn of freedom 'gins to streak The gloomy horizon! and Lackland's reign, Most inauspiciously begun, concludes With privilege for which our fathers fought, Knee-deep in slaughter; and, to which their sons, True to each other, ever will adhere. Success but seldom blest the claim of right In days when strength and skill too frequent won The regal circle; else had Arthur's name, With supercession legal, graced the roll Where John's is now recorded—but what is, We're told is right.—Had Arthur, haply, reign'd His milder sway had fail'd create the cause Which did the glorious great effects produce, Of England's freedom, and of England's rights. As if too conscious of his tottering claim, And, that his crown sat lightly on his head, Four times inaugurated was the King. Philip of France, whose envy ne'er cou'd bend The warlike mind of Richard, now declares Against the title of his brother John, And in behalf of Arthur, claims the throne. Arthur! unfortunate! thy seat usurp'd By an ambitious uncle, and thy right Made, by pretended friendship, but a plea, To sanctify it's interested views! The English Barons murmur and deny Their aid to John, who yet o'ercomes his foes; And Arthur, captive, youthful, innocent, Nor author of the war that Phillip wag'd, Dies in imprisonment.—By some we read, And our great Bard, with magic minstrelsy, Has sung the tale, that from his prison walls, Attempting hopeless egress, he was dash'd Against the earth below, and found, alas! The spirit of his uncle “in those flints With which 'twas bedded.” Argentre, in his “Histoire de Bretagne,” says that, John came late one evening, and took his nephew out of prison; that he rode with him to a cliff that overhung the sea; that there he stabb'd him, and drawing his body by the heels to the brink of the precipice, threw it into the ocean. Other stories tell That murder, (that so frequent blot upon Our English reigns, related, and to come,) With circumstantial cruelty, depriv'd The Prince of life. “Fair Eleanora! wou'd no gallant mind “The cause of love, the cause of justice own, “Matchless thy charms, and was no life resign'd, “To see them sparkle on their native throne? “Oh, shame of Britons! in one sullen tow'r “She wet with royal tears her daily cell, “She found keen anguish ev'ry rose devour, “They sprung, they rose, they faded, and they fell. Shenstone.Eleanor, of Bretagne, the lawful heiress of the English Crown upon the death of Arthur,—esteem'd the beauty of her time, she died in Bristol Castle, after suffering forty years imprisonment. Philip of France, on this pretext, proclaim'd King John a traitor and a murderer; Seiz'd on his French possessions, while the Pope In all concurring, and, pretending right To chuse our Church Directors, John defies (The sole good deed he did) the pow'r of Rome; The Vatican, with thunder loud, replies; And England excommunicate, cut off From ev'ry human privilege, cou'd still, Firm in herself, have scorn'd th' unblest decree, Which dared to arrogate an awful right By heaven's almighty power alone possess'd. At length with meanness equal to his pride, For pride and meanness are concomitant, The land, the people, King, the crown itself, Are pros trate thrown beneath the Pontiff's fect; The Barons feel just anger, and disdain To serve a Prince who owns himself a slave. And soon, of filaments from this disgrace And other grievances, most justly drawn, Was Magna Charta woven, and the King After subscription tried too oft to break The golden compact, which has since upheld Our legal title as a People Free. The following short sketch of what the people gained by Magna Charta, is an abridgement from Hume, by the ingenious James Petit Andrews. “Immunities granted to Barons, are extended to their vassals.” “No Baron to levy money from his vassals, except for attending the King to war, repairing his castles, and the highways and bridges.” “Measures to be equal through the realm.” “Merchants not to be illegally taxed.” “Free egress, and regress to Freemen.” “Cities to preserve their privileges, and only to be taxed by Parliament.” “Bridges to be equitably built or supported.” “Freemen to dispose of goods by will, or, if intestate, their next heir to succeed.” “The King's Purveyor not to sieze goods, &amp;c.” “Courts of Justice not to follow the King, but to be stationary, open, and equal to all men.” “Justice not to be paid for, nor refused to any one, (this was a necessary proviso in a realm where bribes were received by the King to a great amount, and shamelessly set down in books kept for that purpose,) Sheriffs not to put any one on trial without good cause and lawful witnesses.” “No Freeman to be in any way injured in person or goods, except by the law of the land. [Query,—would that be an injury, D.] Redress to be given to those who have suffered illegally. No extravagant fines to be levied on Freemen. No villain, i. e. rustic, to be deprived of his cart or other instruments of husbandry by fine.” Winding beneath the earth, a spacious range Of subterranean chambers yet is seen, At Reigate, in Surrey, it is still called “The Baron's Cave.” Where first, in secresy, the Barons met To frame the code of Freedom.—Short the space From hence to where my humble cot is hid, By wild sequester'd scenery, and oft, Bending my footsteps downwards, do I seek The rock-hewn seats that round the cave remain, And muse with awfully-delighted mind, While witchery of fancy brings to view Majestic forms, and men of other times; Those aged peers whose venerable locks A crested helm, the terror oft of France, Concealed in iron bands,—those youthful lords, Who proud of martial splendour, shone in arms, Which, back reflecting ev'ry torch's blaze, With double light the sacred vault illumed. There mitred Langton, with Fitzwalter brave, Clare, Albermarle, and Gloster, Hereford, Mowbray, and Oxford, Delaval, and Say, Norfolk, De Ros, and bands of heroes more, Retired to fan the patriotic fire, Which bursting into day at Runnimede, With rays of glory lighten'd all the land. The King's bad faith the civil wars renew'd, And Lewis, son of France, call'd in, was own'd As England's master: but the patriot lords, Ill brooking Gallic rule, to John restored His regal state, short time by him enjoy'd. At Newark Castle (not at Swinestead, where Our legendaries tell a fearful tale Of monks and poison,) John respired his last. The story of John's being poisoned at Swinestead Abbey is of a late date, and deserves no credit. Anderson. END OF PART THE FOURTH. PART THE FIFTH.

HENRY THE THIRD. Howe'er historians may our Henry blame, Mercy was ever blended with his name, Nor should his foibles in our memory live, Who knew his worst opposers to forgive; Humane, indulgent, (haply to a fault,) Tho' wanting energy when cares assault, Henry of Winchester, an instance brings, Of “Mercy throned in the hearts of Kings.” Eleven years, no more, the Prince had known, When Pembroke's aid secured him England's throne: The gallant Regent, Lord of Lincoln fight, Asserted Henry's, and the kingdom's right; Compell'd French Louis to depart the land, And held 'till death, the reins with equal hand. Hubert de Burgh and Winchester combined, Rule Albion, one in pow'r, but two in mind; Each Regent disapproves the other's act, And jarring counsels the young Prince distract: The Prelate Winchester is first displaced, Restored, and Hubert in his turn disgraced. Successless war with France the state alarms, And a new Pembroke Son of the late Regent; he afterwards died miserably through the artifices of the Bishop of Winchester, who was himself quickly disgraced by the new Archbishop of Canterbury. Lockman. calls the land to arms; Against the King, his rebel sword he tries, Fortune first smiles, deserts him, and he dies; And, Winchester a second time expell'd, The people's discontents are somewhat quell'd. Not long in quiet did the realm remain, The flames of evil warfare rage again; The Sov'reign, whether wisely, or misled, Fair Eleanor of Provence having wed, The Barons, jealous of her former friends, Relume the brand, which far and wide extends; Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, heads The martial Nobles, and their army leads; Aw'd by their active union, Henry signs The Oxford statutes, and his pow'r resigns To a Conservative Commission; framed One half by him, the rest the Barons named; Again, ill reconciled, the crown and Peers Are foes, and Civil Broil her standard rears At Lewes; Henry and each haughty Lord “Refer decision to the sharpest sword.” The King, his brother, son, and nephew, ta'en, Submit to Montfort, and his Barons reign; We know not if the end what means they tried May sanction, but it cannot be denied, To Leicester and his friends, our nation owes The source whence all her independence flows, The Commons' Senate, and the People's Voice. Long may it's fabric rest upon their choice, And by it's Freedom tell the nations round, Safety alone with Liberty is found. The fate of war, capricious, now ordains That Edward, Henry's son, shall break his chains; A third intestine feud at E'sham vale, Sees Montfort fall, and Henry's son prevail; Young Leicester's and De Gourdon's prompt defeat, And Gloucester's fall, submission now compleat The fame of Edward; and his father's life Closes unchecquer'd by succeeding strife; Yet not a Chief of those subdued, With blood the vengeful axe imbued; Nor scarce a subject died, as records tell, Save those who in the sanguine contest fell. The kingdom in peace, we're by chronicles told, With the fame that young Edward acquired “To Palestine hasten'd the hero so bold,” In whose absence King Henry expired. And thus the longest reign in Britain ended— The present cou'd our warmth of wish extend it In length, as glory should exceed it far, And peace, and plenty, cure the ills of war. These times, 'tis said, old Mathew Paris graced, Among respectable historians placed, And those who love worn out poetic lays, May read two specimens of Henry's days.

The red cross flies in Holy Land, The Saracen his crescent waves, And English Edward's gallant band Seek proud renown, or glorious graves! Yet true religion sure they slight Who deem that worship pure and good Which offers, reeking from the fight, Hands deeply dipp'd in human blood! Surely of life the living Lord For sinners would have died in vain; Did his lov'd cause require the sword Its peaceful doctrine to maintain? Yet so it was, and 'tis so still, Mistaken impulse wooes the strife, Proud to be conquer'd, as to kill, So she but shews contempt of life. No matter whose, or what, the cause For which the front of death we face; If fashion bids us court applause To hesitate were foul disgrace. Edward to aid the sire he loved, Where British Chiefs with Britons met, His manly hardihood had proved, Yet deem'd his honour still in debt. That Pagan proselytes might yield To war's sharp arguments, he fought Till, from his prowess in the field They fled, and treach'rous vengeance sought. A Zealot rear'd the poison'd knife, Nor less a Zealot had he slain, But to the Prince he yields his life, And love's sweet lips the venom drain. Eleanor of Castile, consort to the Prince, is said, at the imminent hazard of her own life, to have preserved that of her husband, by extracting the poison with her lips. Returning, while on Cyprus shore, Heralds the solemn tidings bring, That Edward's father is no more, He received at the same time intelligence of his son's death, a boy six years of age, which he received with resignation; but appeared extremely afflicted at the death of his father: some surprise being expressed at this, he observed, the loss of a son he might hope to replace; but that of a father was irreparable. Andrews, &amp;c. And Edward's self is Albion's King. Now burst his daring passion forth, And clarions loud proclaim afar, To east, and west, to south, and north, That Edward lives but in the war. And first Llewellyn's native land, Where dwelt the genuine British race, Is doom'd to prove stern Edward's hand, And feel oppression's iron mace. Mark! the blood in torrents streaming, Helm, and shield, and faulchion ring, Lightning from each buckler beaming. Hark! the bards indignant sing, (Flames around their harp-strings gleaming,) “Ruin seize thee, ruthless King!” Gray. It is but justice to observe, that the tale of Edward's cruelty to the Welch Bards is much disputed. Andrews says, “It has little authority on its side, except an obscure tradition, and a hint in the Gwydir MS.” To war's keen sword behold sweet peace succeed, And Wallia for an instant ceas'd to bleed; Short was the time the olive branch prevail'd, Llewellyn, stirr'd by David's honest pride, Renew'd the strife of nations! fought and fail'd, And graced the felon block on which he died; Next David on the scaffold yields his breath, And Edward's laurels wither in their death. His Queen the politic usurper sends Caernarvon with a royal birth to grace; And compliments his new made Cambrian friends With a Welch sovereign of English race. Edward the Second, born at Caernarvon Castle. The Welch had promised, it is said, to be satisfied with a native prince, who could not speak a word of English, and this ruse of Edward's perfectly succeeded.—Vide The Chapter of Welch Princes at the end of this reign. Next, Scotia, thou wert doom'd to know Edward a fierce and cruel foe. Baliol and Bruce from civil feud, Appeal to England to award, Whose title was “maist faire, and gude,” To reign as Caledonia's Lord; And Edward's arbitrary arbitration To Baliol decrees the Scottish nation, Provided to the English Monarch's throne The King so named does homage for his own; Baliol with this, at first, complies, Then, blushing for his bargain, from it flies, And, Edward being then at war with France, Edward was delighted when Baliol, by refusing to go and pay homage, gave him pretence to subdue Scotland. “Ha,” said he, “Le fol felon tal folie fait! S'il ne voulut venir à nous, nous “viendrons a lui.”—“Is he then so great a fool! Well, if he will not come to me, I must e'en go to him.” Fordun. 'Gainst England Baliol ventures to advance; But England made a sudden truce With France, and gain'd the aid of Bruce, The wife of Bruce, while at the English court, had the following odd attendant allowed her: “a footboy, sober, and not riotous, to make her bed.” Rymer's Fædera. She had also three men and three women servants, three greyhounds, plenty of fish and game, and the fairest house in the manor. J. P. Andrews. Who sided with the English band, And luckless Baliol lost his land. At the battle of Dunbar, where Baliol was taken prisoner, and Edward became possessed of the national regalia, together with the fatal stone, on which was engraven,Ni fallat fatum, Scoti quocunque locatum, Invenient Lapidem, Regnare tenentiur ibidem. Anglice.Or fate's deceived, and heav'n decrees in vain, Or where they find this stone, the Scots shall reign.” Camb-Wals. And Scotia too had bow'd her down For ever to the English crown, But Wallace, far-famed Wallace, rose, The terror of invading foes. “Scots wha hae wi Wallace bled,” Cou'd ye my feeble muse inspire, With soul of feeling, and of fire, To sing the good, the valiant dead! Whose patriot aims by men of birth, (Poor substitute for genuine worth), Were meanly thwarted, cool'd, and crost, Till what his talents gain'd their envy lost; Who after many a hard fought field, Where English chiefs were fain to yield, In Falkirk's long remember'd fight, (His band preferring death to flight,) When left alone to stem the day, Still kept his enemies at bay, And from his native shelt'ring rocks, Awhile fierce Edward's fury mocks; Till Fortune, fickle, worthless, blind, The patriot to his foe resign'd, The savage foe by honour unconfin'd, Again bids “hangman's hands” pollute the brave, And dooms an Hero to a Traitor's grave. Comyn next leads the plaided warriors on, And Stirling battle is by England won; Still are the Scots determin'd to oppose, And treat intruding Edward's friends as foes. Till the revengeful King in proud array, He called the God of Mercy (a most ill-applied attribute) to witness that he would utterly exterminate the Scotch revolters, which oath was rendered more solemn (according to the strange romantic turn of the age) by the presence of two milk white swans with trappings of gold, which were brought into West-minster-abbey on this occasion, and had their part in the sacred rites of the day. Speéd.Swears to make Scotland bend beneath his sway; Or to exterminate the hardy race, Who greatly scorn'd to give invasion place: But Heaven, in all its dispensations just, Levell'd the haughty monarch with the dust. Thus Longshanks fell, and thus did he bequeath, His hate to Scotia with is dying breath. “Edward, my gallant son,” the monarch cried, “Carry my bones against the Scots,” and died. He called the God of Mercy (a most ill-applied attribute) to witness that he would utterly exterminate the Scotch revolters, which oath was rendered more solemn (according to the strange romantic turn of the age) by the presence of two milk white swans with trappings of gold, which were brought into West-minster-abbey on this occasion, and had their part in the sacred rites of the day. Speéd. In this reign Wickliffe lived, and Roger Bacon: One preach'd reform, Rome thunder'd, he preach'd louder; The second, or historians are mistaken, From nitre found the way to make gunpowder; But Bacon was of fellow men a lover, Nor would the death-fraught recipe discover: Some manuscripts, he left behind, reveal'd What his humanity had kept conceal'd. That poetry in progress was but slow, These lines of “Adam Davie,” serve to show, (Adam was Marshall styled of Stratford Bow). “To our Lord Jhesu Christe in heaven, “I, to-day, shew mine swyven; Dream. “That ich motte, Dreamed. in one nycht, “Of a knyghte of myche mycht, “His name is yhole, Called.

I When Cadwallader, tired of staying at home, Was bit by the Monks, and retired to Rome, Prince Ivor reign'd next, of his subjects the hope, Till he too went over to visit the Pope; Yet barring all pother, Of this, that, or t'other, All came to be Princes in turn.

And Cambria united see all of her Princes Come safe to be Kings in their turn. “Now, lighter humour, leave me and begone, “Your passion poor yields matter much too slight: “To write these plagues that then were coming on, “Doth ask a pen of Ebon, and the night; “If there be ghosts their murder that bemoane, “Let them approach me, and in piteous plight, “Howle, and about me with black tapers stand, “To lend a sad light to my sadder hand.” Drayton. To illustrate his character, let us view his common amusements from an old French MS. of his private expences:— Item.—Paye a Jak de scint Albon, peyntre de Roi qui daunsa devant le Roi sur une table, et lui fist grandement rire, &amp;c. The extract is long, and not easily understood from the obsoleteness of the language; but it proves that the King played at tossing up “heads and tails” for farthings, besides rewarding the above-mentioned buffoon for making him laugh by dancing on a table; he remunerated another for tumbling off a horse before him. Moreover that he made a party on the water in a returned faggot barge, and bought cabbages of the gardeners on the banks of the Thames to compose his soup. Ancient Relics. EDWARD THE SECOND. “Sad was the hour, and luckless was the day,” When second Edward claim'd the regal sway; A reign of imbecility and care, A life of terror closed in sad despair. A scene unchanged of fierce, domestic jars, Rebellion, tyranny, and civil wars, Mark'd the whole period of a monarch's rule, Who knew not how to learn in sorrow's school. Adversity should prove a wholesome friend, And past experience teach us how to mend; But who of mild correction takes no heed, Lost to reflection, must be lost indeed! Could turn of face or majesty of form, Shield from misfortune's overwhelming tide, Edward had weather'd the relentless storm, Nor under pangs unprecedented died. The eye of beauty beams with dazz'ling light, Yet brighter far the lustre of the mind: And dark and cold as drearest winter night The soul to intellectual pleasure blind. Immersed in soft effeminacy's down, The feeble Prince his subjects good neglects For minions, who monopolize the crown, And stain the sceptre which their vice protects. The pamper'd Gaveston, of favour vain, First rous'd our angry Barons' slighted pride; Till forced to banish him, the King with pain, Escorts his darling to the vessel's side. Soon he return'd, again in exile sent, Edward once more his favourite recalls; The land o'erflows with furious discontent, And, spite of royal frowns, the Gascon falls. Gaveston returning in 1312, the whole kingdom was up in arms; the favourite was besieged in Scarborough, taken, and beheaded by the Earl of Warwick. Next in the list, two worthless Spencers came, Whose arrogance the people's rage renew'd; Who peaceful England gave to quenchless flame, And harmony exchanged for civil feud. The Scotch too, mindful of their former woes, When the first Edward with his spoilers came, At Bannockbourn on their now humbled foes Take great revenge and win eternal fame. Baffled by Bruce, the King of England bends To terms prescribed, that wars abroad may cease; Yet loses all his best domestic friends By follies which at home destroy his peace. The Spencers driven from their native land, For rude extortion and oppression sore; Turn pirates, and with fierce marauding band, Infest the coast they oft had robb'd before. Great Lancaster Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, grandson of King Henry III. the Barons' phalanx leads, Edward for once against a foe succeeds; And his opponent on a scaffold bleeds. But Isabel, Isabella of France, daughter of Philip le Bel, the greatest beauty of her age, whom Edward's father had in his dying moments conjured him to marry. the monarch's angry wife, (Jealous of influence the Spencers gain, The Spencers were recalled and loaded with fresh honours.— They were, however, on the King's fortunes suffering a reverse, both executed by the Queen's and Mortimer's party.) Against her husband mingles in the strife, And thoughtless Edward quickly ceas'd to reign. Disgust had made the Queen repair To seek her brother, Charles the Fair; Then leagued with Philip of Hainault, Her lord and sov'reign to assault. Yet who shall free the Gallic dame From stigma, and deserved blame; Was it for her the mote to spy That haply dimm'd her consort's eye: When Mortimer as it should seem, Was, in her own, a monstrous beam. Drayton, thy verse can better tell, The hapless King what next befell; Deposed, deserted, and disgraced, In Ruffian restriction placed, To insult cruelly exposed, With agony his being closed! Gurney, Miscreants, who after practising every degradation on the deposed King, that meanness and malice could invent, put him to a most excruciating death in Kenilworth Castle. When to add to other atrocious indignities, they brought cold and dirty water for Edward to shave with, the unfortunate Monarch, whose tears flowed fast, exclaimed, “You see I have warm water “in spite of you!” It is some alleviation to know that all concerned in Edward's murder met signal retribution. Gurney died by the hands of the executioner; Mautravers perished for want; Edmund, Earl of Kent, who conspired against the King, his brother, was beheaded through the intrigues of Mortimer, and the Queen; of whom the former was hanged, and the latter imprisoned for life. Adam de Orleton, Bishop of Hereford, is said to have sanctioned the assassination of Edward by this ambiguous line: Edwardum occidere, nolite timere, bonum est. Or, Edwardum occidere nolite, timere bonum est. The punctuation making it either, Edward to slay avoid, to fear 'tis good. Or, Edward to slay, avoid to fear! 'tis good. Mautravers, and the crew, Who dared so fell a crime to do, Were punish'd for the blood they spilt, Yet live immortalized in guilf. Oh! may the careless, thoughtless, great, Profit by reading Edward's fate, And men of cruel nature know, Like Edward's murd'rers, more than Edward's woe. The Spencers, who had caus'd this strife, Paid for delinquency with life; And what the folks of England gain, Is, Edward's son styled King in vain, While Mortimer and Isabella reign. Royal Poetry of this Reign. Edward was learned, tho', like me, no poet; The following lines, his own, may serve to shew it; When, to a dungeon fallen from a throne, The royal sufferer thus made his moan: Written by Edward the Second. Of these verses, which Bishop Tanner styles, “Lamentatio gloriosi “Regis Edwardi, de Karnarvon, quam edidit temporæ suæ incarcerationis.” Horace Walpole says, I should believe that this melody of a dying Monarch is about as authentic as that of the old poetic warbler the Swan, and no better founded than the title of Gloriosi. Catalogue of Royal Authors. (On the authority of Fabian.) Damnum mihi contulit Tempore brumali, Fortuna satis aspera Vehementis mali. Nullus est tam sapiens, Mitis, aut formosus Tam prudens virtutibus, Cæterisque famosus Quin, stultus reputabitur Et satis despectus, Si fortuna prosperos Avertat effectus. Imitated by J. P. Andrews. On my devoted head Her bitterest showers, All from a wintry cloud Stern fortune pours; View but her favourite, Sage and discerning, Grac'd with fair comliness, Famed for his learning; Should she withdraw her smiles Each grace she banishes, Wisdom and wit are flown, And beauty vanishes. “Honi soit qui mal y pense.” Motto of the Garter. “Edward first enroll'd “His Redcross Knights, and Barons bold. “Whose vacant seats, by virtue bought, “Ambitious Emperors have sought; “Where Britain's foremost names are found, “In peace beloved, in war renowned; “Who made the hostile nations moan, “Or brought a blessing on their own.” Tickell. “Ich Dien.” Motto of the Black Prince. “Whose ripe manhood spread our fame so far, “A sage in peace, a demi-god in war; “Who stern in fight made echoing Cressey ring, “And mild in conquest, served his captive King?” Tickell. EDWARD THE THIRD. With form and aspect to command respect, With mind, desert and talent to protect, Edward presents a model to admire: His subjects' hearts before their sov'reign bend; The widow's guardian, and the orphan's sire; Foe to the vicious, to the good a friend. Domestic happiness his rich reward, Link'd to his Queen by mutual regard; Proud of a son, whose better scarce drew breath, Through life beloved, lamented in his death. The King, while yet his years were but sixteen, Saw Mortimer ascendant o'er the Queen; Indignant at their joint and lawless rule, Scorning to be a mean, convenient, tool, He boldly took the reins, well knowing, he Who rules o'er Freemen should himself be free. “To Nottingham, the north's imperious eye, “Which as a pharos doth survey the soile, “Armed by nature, danger to defie, “Marche Mortimer was created Earl of March, at the close of the last reign, in 1327. to repose him after all his toile. “Where treason (least advantage might espie) “Closely convey'd his past price valued spoyle; “That there residing from the publique sight, “He might with measure relish his delight.” Drayton. There with “ninescore of special worth and sort “Marche and the Queen maintaine one equal port.” Drayton. So Drayton sings, and further sings how “he “And the bright Queen rule all things by their might, “The state wherein at Nottingham they be, “The cost wherewith their pompeous court is dight, “Envy'd by those their hateful pride that see: “The King attempts the dreadful cave A labyrinth constructed under the castle, through which the King's guards made way to the apartment, where,“Vnarm'd was March (she onely in his armes) “Too soft a shield to beare their boys'trous blowes, “Who least of all suspected such alarmes.” by night; “Entering the castle, taketh him from thence, “And Marche at London dyes for his offence.” The King's fair fame but owns a single blot, Taking an ungenerous advantage of some border excursions, he declared the treaty of Northampton broken, and besieged Berwick; while Baliol (who had been intruded on the Scots as King by Edward, to the prejudice of David Bruce, and chased back to England by the indignant natives,) with an English army entered Scotland, and made Moray, the Regent, prisoner. Archibald Douglas, who succeeded to the Regency, attacking the English, with more courage than conduct, at Hallidown Hill, was slain with the principal nobility, and the army utterly destroyed, with hardly any loss on the side of Edward.— And says an old MS. in the Harleian Collection,“This was do, with mery soune, “With pipes, trompes and tabors therto, “And loud clarionnes they blew also.” Vide J. P. Andrews. Ambition taught him to deceive the Scot; Baliol against his native plains allied, With Caledonian blood his broad sword dyed; At Hallidown too, mournful legends tell, The Douglas with his thirty thousand fell. Turn we the page to where the regal lance With more of honour thins the ranks of France; To where in naval fight 'tis Edward's boast Their fleet to vanquish on the Flemish coast; Two hundred ships destroyed, some tell us more, The French are said to have had four hundred vessels, out of which number they lost two hundred and thirty: while Edward's fleet only consisted of two hundred and forty. It is presumed these ships were principally transports, and those but of small dimensions; the disparity of numbers, however, serves to prove that the bravery and conduct of the British were always supereminent on the ocean. With thirty thousand corses, fright the shore; The King, with half their force, this vict'ry gains, And England's flag most gallantly maintains; With less success the warlike chief, on land, Headed an Anglo-German-Flemish band, A short-lived peace suspends a weak campaign, Till quarrels, for the duchy of Bretagne, “Cry havock! and let loose the war” again. Edward to 'venge his friend, the slain Artois, Joins Montfort's party against Charles de Blois: While valiant Jane de Montfort leads the fight, To vindicate a captive husband's right; Sustaining 'gainst De Blois' superior powers, A fierce blockade and siege in Hennebonne Towers, Where, nearly forced by famine to give place, Sir Walter Manny saves her from disgrace; From conquest almost gain'd, her foes retreat, Aw'd by the presence of an English Fleet! The muse to aid with mingled power of pen, Cou'd time, fame, vict'ry, furnish each a wing, She might essay, but faintly even then, The laurels won on Crecy's plains to sing. With what success then shall her humble plume Of goose-quill uninspired, the task asume? Dare she attempt the praise of England's King, Who like the lion cross'd in wish'd retreat, Turn'd sudden on his hunters? dare she tell How the Black Prince, high thron'd in valour's seat, Directed fortune as by magic spell, And saw Bohemia's Monarch at his feet, While round him Gallia's choicest leaders fell? Alas! she knows not or to praise or blame The King, who cared but for the Prince's fame, And valued less his safety than his name. When nearly overpower'd the youthful chief, (His age fifteen,) sought from his sire relief; No, cried the father, with demeanour stern, My aid would snatch the laurel he may earn, More worthy he to grace a future throne, Who can in danger make success his own, And owe the glory to himself alone. Bohemia's King, eleven leaders more, Who regal ensigns on their armour bore, With eighty bannerets, twelve hundred knights, Of nobles, fifteen hundred—men of name; Four thousand men at arms, which implies a distinction, are given in the list; besides thirty thousand common soldiers. Four thousand (so undoubted hist'ry writes), With thirty thousand soldiers of less fame, Fell on that ever memorable day: While Edward's loss was only, strange to say, Three knights, one valiant squire, and few indeed Of private station who were known to bleed. Calais, besieged, great Edward's pow'r defies, Till “famine cling them,” and the King enraged, Soon as the city at his mercy lies, To punish those whom self-defence engaged In patriot warfare, to their pray'r for peace, Decrees from slaughter 'ere the sword shall cease, Six of their noblest with disgrace shall die: Six, self-devoted, to the threat reply; But great and good Phillippa's suppliant breath, Phillippa on more than one occasion had the happiness to be successful in the amiable character of an intercessor. In the fourth year of this reign, a scaffold on which the Queen and many ladies were seated to see a tournament in Cheapside, fell down, and the royal and noble auditresses were precipitated from a considerable height; the carpenters would have inevitably suffered death, but the stern Edward was softened by the prayers and tears of the amiable Phillippa. Saves Edward from dishonour, them from death; Phillippa who from England came, With more of wreaths for Edward's name. The Scottish King who vainly thought, He, in the royal absence, might invade Our land, with loss of crown the effort bought, And by Phillippa's arm was prisoner made At Nevill's Cross, where, fatal to his reign, Of valiant Scots are fifteen thousand slain. His son and comrades to reward, For triumphs won in contest hard, O'er Edward's oft defeated foes, The Order of the Garter rose. 'Tis said of gayer origin it came, The story coupled with a lady's name, Though many give credit to what Andrews calls the picturesque story of this order, originating from the Countess of Salisbury's garter, yet he adds from Rastell's Chronicle, that “Some do affirme that this order beganne fyrst by King Richard Cœur de Lyon, at the siege of the citie of Acres, where in his greate necessy tie there were but twenty-five knights that firmlye and surelye abode by him, where he caused all them to wear thonges of blue leythere aboute their legges, and afterwards they were called knights.” Yet, with due rev'rence to the lovely dame, (We delicately touch so soft a string) Tho' great effect from little cause may spring, 'Twere better here to have it understood, As royal guerdon for the great and good. Glory, untired of decking Edward's helm, (And with her beams his enemies to whelm) Again illumes the Sable Prince, who gains Another day, unmatch'd in former reigns: A second Crecy to the first succeeds, At Poictiers, scene of more than mortal deeds; With front unmoved, the Prince beholds advance, To crush his little band, the power of France: Attacked by Monarch, Princes, Nobles, all, He sees their Princes, Nobles, Warriors, fall; Hears their King own himself in grief's despite, Surpass'd in courtsey as foil'd in fight; The number of French slain were, two Dukes, nineteen Earls, many Knights and Gentlemen, with several thousand men at arms. The prisoners were still more numerous, at the head of whom was their King John, who was treated with the most delicate respect by his conqueror, after his arrival in England. Henry Picard, Lord Mayor of London, had the honour to entertain the captive Kings of France and Scotland, and the King of Cyprus at one table, with most hospitable magnificence. While England views her sovereign mildly greet Two captive Monarchs kneeling at his feet. A cloud at length obscures the brilliant day, Young Edward, after deeds excelled by none, 'Mid dazzling career was snatch'd away, And with him, for a while, set England's sun! Scarcely a year his mourning sire survived The darling son in whom his glory lived; And prov'd, however fortunate and brave, “The paths of glory lead but to a grave.” Tho' yet our stubborn language gave small scope, To poesy and “lisp'd in numbers” still; Chaucer Chaucer, styled the first English poet, was page to Edward III. in 1359, married Phillippa, the sister of Catherine Swynford, (the future wife of John of Gaunt,) and is said to have had a large income, he was imprisoned as a Lollard, but ended his life in ease and plenty, at Donnington Castle, Berks, where he composed most of his best productions. gave birth to a prophetic hope, Of what succeeding ages might fulfil.

His Uncles Lancaster The celebrated John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster; the Earl of Cambridge, afterwards Duke of York; and the Duke of Gloucester; all uncles to the King, were appointed his guardians, he being but ten years old. and Gloucester sway, With York, whose guardianship the States obey. Ambitious guardians! to prolong their rule, They represent their nephew as the tool Of Nevil and Tresilian, Pole and Vere, Vere, Earl of Oxford, Marquis of Dublin, and Duke of Ireland; Tresilian, a Judge; Michael de la Pole, a merchant's son; and Nevil, Archbishop of York. (Who certainly had gained the royal ear.) Much more his uncles had their charge befriended, If they in honesty had recollected, Some faults without exposure may be mended, And by mild means are ofttimes best corrected. But, as there's little in this reign, Save what we must record with pain, Sans further comment let us try, A very brief Chronology, 'Twill trouble spare to you and us, Kind reader if you'll take it thus: In thirteen hundred seventy-seven, King Edward went, we hope, to heaven; And left his grandson, doom'd by birth, To wear a careful crown on earth. In thirteen hundred seventy eight, Wickliff's A reformer of the Romish Church, he was cited by the Ecclesiastical Courts, but protected against them by the Duke of Lancaster. opinions posed the state. And John of Gaunt marched many men To France,—to bring them back again; While thirteen seventy nine and eighty, Are not renowned for matters weighty, Until a poll tax, ill collected, Much danger to the land effected; And caused the evils which were done In thirteen hundred eighty one. Wat Tyler and his friend Jack Straw, Into their own hands take the law, 'Till Walworth Sir William Walworth, Lord Mayor of London, enraged at Tyler's insolence in an interview with the King, struck him to the ground, and the dagger with which he dispatched him is commemorated by a place in the city arms. knock'd rebellion down, By cracking Master Tyler's crown; And 'tis but just in Richard's cause, To say his gallantry deserved applause, The savage crew, by Tyler's death inflamed, Were by his conduct, mild, yet brave, reclaimed. The anarchy that er'st prevailed, Is by friend Andrew's thus detailed, Translated in a prosperous hour, From that famed poet Master Gower: Gower's verses as a specimen of this reign's literature may not be unacceptable, particularly from the comic effect produced by putting English nick-names into a Latin dress. “Watte vocat cui Thoma venit, neque Symme retardat, “Bat que, Gibbe simul, Hykke venire subent. “Colle furit, quem Bobbe juvat, nocumenta parantes, “Cum quibus ad damnum Wille coire vovet. “Grigge rapit, Dum Davie, strepit, comes est quibus Hobbe, “Larkin, et in medio non minor esse putat, “Hudde ferit, quem Judde terit, dum Tibbe juvatur, “Jakke domosque vivos vellit, &amp; ense neeat, &amp;c.” “Wat cries, Tom flies, nor Symkin stays aside; “And Batt and Gibb, and Hyke Isaac. they summon loud, “Colin and Bob combustibles provide, “While Will the mischief forwards in the crowd; “Greg hawls, Hob bawls, and Davy joins the cry “With Larry, not the least among the throng; “Hodge drubbs, Jude scrubbs, while Tib stands grinning by, “And Jack with sword and firebrand madly strides along. In thirteen hundred eighty two, The King had something more to do; For doomed to lead a restless life, Bohemian Ann he took to wife. In thirteen hundred eighty three, A Bishop Norwich. militant we see Against the French, who does no more Than John of Gaunt achieved before. In eighty four and eighty five, The Scots against our armies thrive; And Richard loses Joan his mother, She broke her heart because Richard would not forgive Lord Holland, her son by a second marriage, for the murder of Lord Stafford's heir. Yet the inconsistent King granted him the next day the very pardon which, however unjust, would some hours earlier have saved his parent's life. For grief, he would'nt spare his brother. In thirteen hundred eighty six, King Richard's favourites play sad tricks; Degrading so their lord's condition, The crown was rendered in commission. The King was forced through a dread of deposition to abandon his Ministers, and even commit the government of the realm to twelve commissioners appointed by parliament. In eighty seven the French confess, The British Tars command success; Being by Nottingham's brave fleet. As since by others, soundly beat. He took one hundred and fifty sail. 'Twas Tresil'an and Brembres fate, To swing in thirteen eighty eight; “Sponges” who “soak'd authority” 'Till “squeez'd, and then hung up to dry;” In this year too we find a place For famous fight of Chevy Chace Celebrated by ancient Scotch Bards as the battle of Otterbourne. —Vide Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, p. 27. In thirteen hundred eighty nine, The Nobles to the King resign Unfettered rule, Richard at this period abounded in money, which he raised by various extortions, to squander it away in ridiculous prodigality; of this, John Handinge, a cotemporary poet, “not over smoothly,” sings:— “Truly I herd Robert Ireleffe say, “(Clerke of the grene cloth) that to thè housholde “Came every dayè forth, most part alway, “Ten thousand folkis, bi his messes told, “That follow'd the house, ayè as thei wold; “And, in the ketchin, three hundred servitours, “And, in eche office, many occup'ours; “Chamberers also, eke and launderers, “And ladies fair, with their gentlewomen, “Three hundred of them occupied were then, “There was great pride among the officers; “And of all men far passing their compeers, “Of rich arraye, and more cost o-us, “Than was before or since more preci-ous.” Richard's favorite method of obtaining money, was by loan; the proportions of the respective sums (as given by Andrews, from Rymer's Fædera) will shew the comparative wealth of the English Chies: “From London, was asked ....................... 10,000 Marks. “York, Gloucester, Salisbury, and Lincoln, each 200 Marks. “Cambridge, Canterbury, &amp; Southampton, each 100 Marks. “Bristol ....................................... 800 Marks. “Norwich ....................................... 500 Marks. “Lynn .......................................... 400 Marks. “Bath, Derby, and Litchfield, each ............. 20 Marks. “Harwich and Liskeard. each .................... 10 Marks. and ninety sees (Only one year) the land at ease. With ninety one some Dæmon sent Famine and plague and discontent; Nor ninety two, nor three brought more Of happiness, while ninety four, Still to depress the luckless man, Deprived him of his good Queen Ann; Who bid the fair no more bestride Their steeds like men, but first to ride As now, with decent modest pride, Gracing the happy saddle's side.

Once, also, he drew his sword on me, in the chamber of Queen Ann! Oh, heaven! how truly is it said that the most deadly foe a man can have, is he whom he has saved from destruction.” the King deposes, Whose scene of earthly grandeur closes. Forced Albion's sceptre to resign, In thirteen hundred ninety nine. And soon in the succeeding year, By means most horrible we fear, His spirit sought that Judge most just, Who sees in Kings but common dust. 'Tis said Piers Exton and eight more, Of fiend-like ruffians join'd to slay Their 'prisoned Sovereign, who bore Himself in knightly sort that fatal day, Of his opponents killing four, As tho' the spirit of his sire in death, Breathed valour from the source which gave the Monarch breath.

HENRY THE FOURTH. SURNAMED OF BOLINGBROKE. Q. Under what colour, or pretended claim, Did Bolingbroke aspire to Richard's Throne? A. Edward the third's fourth son, who bore the name Of John of Gaunt, as Henry's sire was known. Q. What claimant else look'd upward to the crown? A. One whose more just pretensions were put down By Henry's friends,—young Mortimer the heir Of Clarence, Edward's second son,—more fair His title: but in Henry's hand was power, Which brow beats Justice to this very hour. Q. What troubles shaded Henry's prosp'rous star? A. A scene of foreign and of civil war; And tho' he conquered each domestic foe, 'Twas Henry's lot to find new troubles grow; From these o'ercome, as poets sing of yore, That Hydra Heads, when crop'd, encreas'd the more. As if the Gods refused that Prince to bless, Whose tyranny but grew with his success. Religion too excites mistaken ire, And martyr'd Lollards Thomas Badby, a Worcestershire tailor, burnt in Smithfield for denying the corporeal presence in the sacramental bread, was one of the first English martyrs. The young Prince Henry twice ordered him to be taken from the stake, and a pardon and a pension were offered him; but he persisted, and died in the maintenance of his opinion. feed the bigots fire; “Henry the Cruel” was the name obtain'd From blood of subjects almost daily drain'd. Q. What foreign powers join with mighty foes, The right and reign of Henry to oppose? A. The Scotch; bold Douglas leads a hardy band, To aid young Percy of Northumberland In Mortimer's behalf,—their efforts meet In frequent fields, succession of defeat. The Douglas yields Earl Douglas had before been taken prisoner, at the battle of Holmedon, where, enraged at the havoc made by the English archers, (according to Walsingham) he rushed forward, accompanied by eighty men of rank, to disperse that formidable corps; but was wounded in five places, and made prisoner. After his liberation, he again led the Scots at the battle of Worcester, where he broke through the English ranks, and slew three persons dress'd like Henry. At length he fled, and having fallen down and wounded himself in a strange manner, was taken. The Prince of Wales, hitherto not an estimable character, fought bravely, and though wounded in the face, would not quit the field: the King, too, is said to have performed prodigies of valour, and to have slain thirty-six rebels with his own hand., the Percy breathless lies: And Scotland's Prince becomes the Victor's prize. Q. What nations else co-operation bring, To join with those who hate the reigning king? A. The French assist the fiery chiefs of Wales, Whose enterprize, like that related, fails; Glen dower's fortune seems at first to soar, Aided by stormy blasts, and thunder's roar, So strangely that the lustre of his arms Is dimm'd by a belief that magic charms Enabled him to lull his foes to sleep, And “conjure spirits from the vasty deep.” Q. Against the King what else attempted France? A. In Guienne with some success their arms advance, At Calais too the chance of war they tried; But Henry's arts the gallic chiefs divide, Distract their councils, keep their force at bay, 'Till “Divide and Imp'ra” wins the day. Q. Was he not with paternal cares opprest? A. The conduct of his son disturbed his rest; The Prince forgetful of his rank and worth, Associates with men of slightest worth, Unblushing leads their vulgar sports by day, And, rendered by their nightly revels gay, “Hot with the Tuscan grape and high in blood,” 'Tis said with robbers leagued he rashly stood, And here might we “in jocund strains recite, The Prince had the imprudence to appear in Court, to countenance one of his offending associates, and actually struck the Judge on the Bench: but, as instantly ashamed of his conduct, submitted to go to prison. The King was equally pleased with the firmness of the Judge, (Gascoigne) and the obedience of his Son; who afterwards hearing his Father suspected him of measures to disturb the public peace, went to Court to acquit himself, in a kind of allegorical habit, which has never been accounted for.—“He was apparelled in a gown of blue satin, full of oilet holes; at every hole, the needle hanging by a silk thread with which it was sewed.” The prurient “humours of the braggart knight; Garrick's Jubilee.” But one Will Shakespeare having told the tale, We should but make a shrimp of Billy's whale. The Prince who thus his dignity could stain, Had power lost reputation to regain; And “revocare gradus” firmly tried, 'Till, from its scorn, he shone a nation's pride; “Offending so, to make offence a skill, “Redeeming time” he'd let too long stand still. Q Or did the Monarch feel, or seem to feel, Against the infidels “most christian” zeal? A. Yes, and no more of foes at home afraid, He meant to undertake a grand crusade; For some false prophet ventured to divine, He should expire in holy Palestine, And expiating sins and folly's past, Jerusalem should see him breathe his last. Q. And did it? A. Yes; and yet the prophet err'd, For this Jerusalem, as we have heard, Was but a room so called, where Henry's breath, Cut short by leprosy, Or by a paralytic attack. was closed in death. Q. What men of eminence his reign adorn? A. With English science 'twas but early morn; William of Wickham, Chaucer, Master Gower, Gower; a specimen from whom is given under Richard II. died in 1402. Chaucer addresses him, “O! moral Gower! &amp;c, &amp;c.” James I. of Scotland thus speaks of him and Chaucer; “Unto Impnis of my maisteris dere “Gower and Chaucer, on the steps they sate “Of rhetorike, whyle they were lyvande here, “Superlative as Poets-Laureatte. “In moralitie and eloquence ornate.” Sir Robert Knolles, of valiant knights the flower; And surely to omit would not be fair, The famed Sir Richard Whittington, Lord Mayor, Of whom each 'prentice has the story pat, Of London bells, cross cook maids, and a cat. Whittington founded an Hospital, made many charitable bequests, and rebuilt Newgate, where the statue of his Cat, according to Pennant, accompanied his own. Q. Did not the King, who ow'd it most protection, Oft' violate the freedom of election? A. Most shamefully, and Sheriffs were required But to return what men the Court desired; Who, acquiescing with obsequious bow, Projected taxes, high as they are now. The rich the taxes wou'd'nt pay, The poor the taxes cou'd'nt pay; And middle ranks might rightly say, (As sang a poet of that day): “Duce ace non possunt, et sise cinque solvere nolunt, “Est igitur notum, Cater-tray solvere totum.” Camden. Of which, for ladies' information, We add James Petit Andrew's imitation: “Says Duce Ace I can't, “Says Size Cinque I sha'n't: “So poor Cater-tray “The whole sum must pay.” “Young Harry's the lad for me.” Mrs. Brookes. Who gain'd at Agincourt the victor's bays, Nor took himself, but gave to Heav'n, the praise! Tickel. “By pleasure's bright allurements led along, “Soon did he shake his head, and say that all was wrong! “Then, streams of radiance mark'd his destin'd way; “Where'er he trod the magic gleams appear; “His burnish'd breast-plate sparkled on the day, “And glory's harp still roll'd along his ear.” Leigh Hunt's Palace of Pleasure. “Not to day, O! lord, “Oh! not to-day! Think not upon the fault “My father made in compassing the crown. “I Richard's body have interred new, “And on it have bestowed more contrite tears, “Than from it issued forced drops of blood. “Five hundred poor have I in yearly pay, “Who, twice a day, their wither'd hands hold up “To Heav'n, to pardon blood!—And I have built “Two chauntries, where the sad and solemn priests “Sing still for Richard's soul! Shakespeare. “In our fifth Harry's reign, when 'twas the fashion “To thump the French, poor creatures, to excess, “Tho' Britons now-a-day show more compassion, “And thump them, certainly, a great deal less. Mr. Colman wrote this before some late glorious events in the Peninsula, and other parts of Europe. “For Harry's reign, when flush'd Lancastrian roses “Of York's pale blossoms had usurp'd the right, “As wine drives nature out of drunkards' noses, “'Till red, triumphantly, eclipses white “In Harry's reign.—But let me to my song, “Or, good King Harry's reign may seem too long.” George Colman, the Younger. HENRY V. surnamed of MONMOUTH. Scarce Bolingbroke lay quietly inurned, E're the succeeding Prince with ardour burn'd To pay obedience to a sire's behest, And keep the nobles from reflective rest. But first with manly promptness it was said, To stigmatise the life he lately led, Young Henry bade his former friends draw near, And on his own, as on their faults severe; Taking an ample share of serious blame, Pointed the better path to honest fame, Admonish'd, gave the means, their lives to mend— Yet promised only further to befriend, When merit justly claiming his regard, By reformation led, should seek reward. Those who of late reproved his lawless youth, And served his father with unyielding truth, They trembling now approach'd the rising sun, But found his thoughtless race of error run; Advancement on their former zeal attends, And all are hailed as counsellors and friends. “He was not only anxious to repair his own misconduct. but also to make amends for those iniquities into which his father had been betrayed. He expressed the deepest sorrow at the fate of the unhappy Richard; performed his funeral obsequies with pomp and solemnity; and cherished all who had been attached to him.” Hume. But chiefly him Judge Gascoigne. whose bold and upright mind (To all distinction, in his duty, blind,) Maintain'd the honor of his master's place, Nor would permit a prince the law disgrace Without reproof; his ancient sovereign then Proclaim'd himself most blest of royal men. In such a son who feared to disobey, Or rather, who, for disobedience shown, Submitted gracefully his fault to own, Confess'd himself inferior to the laws, And turn'd past censure to deserv'd applause. The youthful monarch now to Paris sends, Proposing France and England should be friends, That Catherine's Daughter of Charles VI. of France. hand with his in wedlock join'd, A league of lasting amity might bind; But then, for dowry, 'tis demanded, France Two million crowns, prompt payment, should advance; With an old debt of near two million more, As King John's ransom, bargained for before. Then Normandy and other lands beside, Were woo'd with much more ardor than the bride. France offers Harry, and I think no slight, A wife, eight hundred thousand crowns, with right Of Sovereignty in Guienne, and to be Lord Of Rouerne, Saintongue, Aug'more, Perigord; But Henry ready with a numerous fleet, He was, perhaps, the first English Monarch who had ships of his own; two were called the King's Chamber, and the King's Hall; they had purple sails, and were large and beautiful; there were also the Trinitie, the Grace de Dieu, the Holy Ghost, and many more which now be lost. Vide J. P. Andrews. Refused, for less than what he ask'd to treat. There be some cunning folks to think inclined, The King had pretty well made up his mind, That France would surely beg to be excused, From terms on purpose framed to be refused; Whether such policy suit ill or well With honest dealing, is not mine to tell, My task but gives in brief the Sovereign's acts, 'Tis your's to make due inference from facts. There is a tale, but founded not in truth, That Charles the Dauphin, slighting Henry's youth, A tun of tennis balls in gibe sent o'er, As suited to the life Hal led before; But all historians of respected name The verity of such an act disclaim; France at all time, from circumstances, was far From wishing ought that might provoke a war. “Now all the youth of England are on fire,” And France is threaten'd with our hottest ire; When treason midst an host of knightly peers, Close to the King's her felon banner rears, Lord Scrope, Earl Cambridge, and Sir Thomas Grey, Conspire (supposed with March,) to take away The crown and life of Harry; Justice keen, As sudden as unlook'd for, steps between The plot and execution, treason fails, The traitors fall, and gallant Henry sails. At Harfleur now the gallic drums, Give note our English hero comes. Harfleur surrenders; Henry's host Prepares for Calais, when 'tis found That France, collecting all her boast Of rank and valour, line the coast, And with proud threat the British band surround. Henry makes offer Harfleur to restore, And to retrace his steps; the French deny; The English Chief has but one project more, To beat his four-fold enemy or die. Oh, memory of Crecy, come again, And Poictiers too.—Shades of the slain ne'er scoff, Let your bright blades assist to mend my pen, Or Agincourt Called also, Azincourt. will come most tamely off. The French, who 'ere a pris'ner had been taken, Had sold the English as they did before, Lost ev'ry purchase, cou'dn't save their bacon, And got, to clench the nail, one drubbing more. Their gilded herald asked our iron King His army's safety, and his own to buy; Harry thrice answer'd he'd do no such thing, And his applauding troops with shouts reply. The French, astonish'd at our not retreating On any terms, so pitied us the beating Intended for us, they'd no heart to give it, And (Memory of the deed will long out-live it!) The kind compassionating well-bred elves, Were good enough to take it on themselves; In two words, never was a day so dashing, Nor ever did Mounseer get such a thrashing. Six Princes The Count of Nevers, Vaudemonte, and Marle; the Dukes of Brabant, Alenzon, and Barre. of the blood were slain outright, Or, a-la-modern French, the dust did bite; Archbishop Sens, and Constable of France, Fall also victims to the English lance. Orleans, two Bourbouns, Vendome, D'Eu, who yield With Boucicaut, and Richemonte on the field, Of fourteen thousand captives swell the train, Who mourn at least ten thousand comrades slain! The Duke of York, brave Suffolk, and as few As thirty With the English Army there was only one Surgeon, who, says Rymer's Fædera, had engaged to find fifteen more; three of whom were to act as Archers. more, if chronicles speak true, Were all who fell on conquering Harry's side; Among them Davy Gam, “The King had been rescued by Davy Gam, and two others, right valiant Welchmen, Roger Vaughan and Walter Lloyd, of Brecknock, who were knighted as they lay bleeding to death.” Monstrelet. of Wales the pride, Who being ask'd how many were the foe? Answered, “Hur did not quite exactly know: “But this hur poldly wou'd peg leave to say, “There wou'd pe found enough upon that day, “To die, be taken, or to run away.” Yet this great victory, like those of yore, At Cressy and Poictiers, produced no more Than reputation,—Henry made a pause, In which his foes recruit their sinking cause. To England, with his pris'ners, sailed away, Gaining alone the honor of that day; While in succession to dissentions rude, A two years truce the adverse Kings conclude. Now, by her children wounded, Gallia bleeds, And “civil dudgeon” foreign wars succeeds; Henry returns and joins King Charles—poor elf, To fight against the Dauphin for himself; Wins lower Normandy, each claim renews That France erst did, but dare not now refuse, Proving our sacred Master's lesson good, “No kingdom self-divided ever stood.” Thus Henry strength from Charles's weakness gains, And each ambitious wish with ease obtains; Kate's hand endowed with treasure, province, town, And the reversion of the Gallic crown, (Which came in time, for he had pawn'd his own.) The revenues of the Government, and the grants of Parliament, were so inadequate to Henry's expensive armies and expeditions, that he was forced to pawn his crown to his uncle, Cardinal Beaufort, for a large sum; and certain jewels to the Lord Mayor of London, for ten thousand marks; he was also obliged to pledge two gold chased basons, weighing together 28lb. 80z. to two Canons of Saint Paul's, for six hundred marks; and two golden shells to the Dean of Lincoln, for one hundred more.—The cost of his army was great: each Knight received 20s. per diem; a 'Squire, 10s. and each Archer, 5s—Besides which, he had a costly band of music, among which were ten clarions, which played an hour, night and morning, before his tent. Bertrand De Moleville, J.P. Andrews, Rymer's Fædera, Monstrelet, &amp;c. At Troyes a solemn treaty they prepare, When England is of France decreed the heir; The Dauphin, scorning to resign his right, Subdues and is subdued, in frequent fight. Henry to reinforce his troops comes over, And levies bands which rendezvous at Dover; Mean time the Scots, by gallant Buchan led, Against us in the Dauphin's cause make head; For England royal Clarence heads the strife, And loses, in a brother's cause, his life. In the battle of Bareges, where a Knight, wounded the Duke of Clarence in the face, and the mace of Lord Buchan deprived him of his life. Dorset and Somerset, of English lords, With Huntingdon, resign their captive swords, When Henry with his new-raised force arrives, To 'venge his brother's and his warriors' lives, Beyond the Loire the Dauphin's standard chaced, And well retrieved what late our arms disgraced. Scarce had his conquering sword this laurel won, 'Ere Catherine presents him with a son; His glory and success attain their height, When death converts his brilliant day to night. The Lollards still, from persecuting zeal, Were doom'd the fires of bigotry to feel; And good Lord Cobham, This Martyr's name is in the catalogue of noble authors. for opinion's sake, With other martyrs suffered at the stake. Few other incidents to tell remain, The visit of an Emp'ror The Emperor Sigismond, who came to mediate between this country and France. graced this reign; Three Popes “Benedict, Gregory, and John, the Council of Constance, sate to terminate this schism. Henry sent nine English prelates thither; one of whom, Richard Clifford, Bishop of London, was the first nominated by the Council to be Pope, and the first nominated him that succeeded, which was Otho Colonna, by the name of Martin the Fifth.” Medulla Historiæ Anclicanæ. at once assume St. Peter's Chair, And-Seven Dolphins In the third year of Henry's Reign, four of them were taken; they made their appearance in the Thames on Candlemas day, but author finding that date no rhyme to “St. Peter's Chair,” took the liberty of treating the said Dolphins with an Easter or Whitsuntide peep at the grand gala of the London 'prentices. swam to Greenwich fair!!! A modest Poet claims some notice here, Somewhat of Chaucer “doth in him appear;” And it were well, perhaps, you think for me, To take good note by “hys humiletie;” Thro' which fair veil a spark of genius shines, As is “set forth” in these “his pythie lines.” “I am a monk by my profession, “Of Bury, call'd John Lydgate by my name, “And wear a habit of perfection, “Altho' my life agree not with the same; “That meddle should with things spiritual, “As I must needs confess unto you all.” “But seeing, as I did in this proceed, “At his King Henry the Fifth. commands whom I could not refuse, “I humbly do beseech all those that read, “Or leisure have this story to peruse, “If any fault therein they find to be, “Or error that committed is by me, “That they will of their gentleness, take pain, “The rather to correct, and mend the same, “Than rashly to condemn it with disdain; “For well I wot, it is not without blame, “Because I know the verse therein is wrong, “As being some too short, and some too long.” In this reign too, thus singeth Tom Occleve, Who for his “mayster” Chaucer's loss doth grieve: “But well awaye so is myne hert'e wo', “That the honour of English tongue is dede, “Of which I wont Was wont to have. was han cousel rede! “O, mayster dere, and fader reverent! “My mayster Chaucer, flowre of eloquence! “What eyled Deth? alas! why wode he sle' the? “O Deth thou didst no harm singuliere, “In slaughter of him, both all the land it smarteth; “But nathless yt hast thou no power, “His name to sle,” &amp;c, &amp;c. “More sinn'd against than sinning.” Shakespeare. “The best of men have ever loved repose; “They hate to mingle in the filthy fray, “Where the soul sours, and gradual rancour grows “Imbittered more from peevish day to day.” Thomson. “While second Richard's blood for vengeance calls, “Doom'd for his grandsire's guilt, poor Henry falls “In civil jars, avenging judgment blows “And royal wrongs, entail a people's woes; “Henry unversed in wiles, more good than great, “Drew on by meekness his disastrous fate.” Savage. “Plague of both your houses.” Shakespeare. “When Greek met Greek, then was the tug of war.” Lee. HENRY VI. surnamed OF WINDSOR. Eight months of life the little monarch owns, Whose baby sceptre ruled a brace of thrones; At Westminster and Paris, crown'd in both, His subjects take the customary oath. In both to break it—Soon his foreign crown Sits loose, his English sceptre beaten down By party and rebellious civil war, He proves the splendor of a falling star! Gloucester as Regent of the realm appears, During the infant Sovereign's tender years; Bedford in France not destin'd long to stay, In Henry's name supports the English sway. The Dauphin, (who when meaning to be merry, The English styled “the little King of Berry,”) Still of his birthright kept encreasing hold, Nor let his, surely just, pretence take cold. “About this time, at the siege of Orleans, fell the Earl of Salisbury by a cannon shot, being the first English gentleman ever slain thereby.” Camden. And now to help him with most wond'rous aid, From fields obscure, In the Village of Domremi, near Vaucoleurs, on the borders of Loraine. darts forth a village maid; A shepherdess—her story you may mark, Told wond'rously in “Southey's Joan of Arc;” So well indeed—the Imp of Envy fetch it! That I'm afraid in outline but to sketch it. Poor Joan, who cou'd'nt read, “Oh, spite of spite!” Has an historian now, who cannot write; She's to be pitied, but unless I err, The loss is more to me, than 'twas to her: Well, be it so, whether I win or lose, The tale I'll tell, and tell it how I chuse. JOAN of ARC. A Tragedye fulle of Merrie Conceites. Joan of Arc, they say, was mad, Some a conjuror misname her; And swear she by the Dauphin had A little—but why here defame her? French authors say she never slept in camp without two of her brothers to guard her; nor in a town without some female, of exemplary character, to bear her company. Who against the maid say this? Enemies I dare assure ye; And she's no subject well I wis, For trial by an English Jury. Britons then would jibe, as now, At men of France,—could kill and eat 'em; Yet contrived, I can't tell how, To let a French young woman beat 'em. Joan, derived of parents poor, Had nor learning, name, nor riches; Yet did wonders, to be sure, As ladies will who wear the breeches. By some 'tis not unshrewdly thought, She by the Dauphin's friends was taught To play her pretty patriotic part; Well, if she was, She own'd, that's poz, Uncommon skill, and most consummate art. Joan was a simple shepherd's maid, Yet nightly visited, she said, By visions, and by angel sights; Which told her where, if she'd a mind, A rare and rusty sword to find, With power to put the English folks to rights. Then in the stoutness of her soul, She sent to William De la Pole, And bid him lead his Britons back; Or, by the guardian pow'rs of France, She swore to make his people dance, And bang his body like a sack. I own the simile is very low, But Joan would speak her mind you know; And, I know too, a shepherd wench is, (Whether she English girl or French is), Not sheepish when conversing with a foe. Something she must have said, which form derides, For De la pole Thought it so droll, He laugh'd enough to split his Suffolk sides. But when his armour she began to batter, The chief declared 'twas no such laughing matter; Nor knew by what ill-natured names to christen her, When, spite of his broad sword, she took him pris'ner. Suffolk was taken by Renaud, a French gentleman, whom he first knighted before he would surrender to him. Talbot, and Hungerford, Rampstone, and Scales, Fretted like hottest gentlemen of Wales When they were taken,—swore 'twas very odd, The French ascribed the power of a God To sturdy Joan, while Englishmen less civil, Declared such treatment was the very Devil. The Regent, in his letter to the King and Council, speaks of Joan as a Disciple and Lymme of the Fiende that used fals Enchauntments and Sorcerie, the which strocke and discomfiture not onlie lessed in grete Pertie the nombre of youre people there, bote as well withdrowe the courage of the reminant in mervellous wyse.” Rymer's Fædera. Towns she relieved, more captives took, And thro' her valour Charles, it seems, Was crown'd the Sovereign of France at Rheims After the coronation, she embraced the King's knees, and with tears extorted by pleasure and tenderness, congratulated him in this singular and marvellous event.” Hume. When by her brilliant star forsook, A knight of Burgundy o'ercame poor Joan, Sent her in irons to be tried at Roan. Where can I without shame relate it? Wicked transaction! how I hate it! Soldiers and nobles, gentlemen of note, Prelates,—the story's sticking in my throat, A mean trap laid, To catch the maid While putting on, poor girl, a suit of armour; And, foul befal the chiefs that so could harm her! To all their everlasting shames, (I burst to call them fifty names,) Condemn'd the gallant damsel to the flames. And was this most unmanly action done Merely for putting martial harness on? No, 'twas mere spite, one sees it in a minute, Because she had most soundly thrash'd 'em in it. The death of Bedford When the Dauphin, after being crowned, was advised to demolish the Regent's decent monument of black marble, “Let him repose”, said the generous monarch, “in peace, and be thankful that he does repose; were he awake, he would make the stoutest among us tremble.” matters didn't mend, Each day we gain'd a foe or lost a friend; Each day our gallic fortune met reverse, And bad news only came to herald worse. King Henry some time after this got married, To Margaret of Anjou, Daughter to Reigner, King of Sicily, A match which gave his subjects little pleasure, For all his wishes, save the Queen, miscarried, And folks grew discontented out of measure. Cardinal Beaufort had been a Bishop fifty years; he left an illegitimate daughter, and founded the Abbey of Saint Cross, at Winton; as Legate from Rome, and as an ambitious meddling Priest, he was universally dreaded. He survived his uncle, the good Duke, whom he had greatly persecuted, but a few days. To Margaret, we hope with falsehood's breath, The people laid the good Duke Humphrey's death; Soon after having been seized by the Queen's party on a charge of treason, he was found dead in his bed. His wife Eleanor had been ignominiously punished on a charge of sorcery, and was not permitted to enjoy her jointure after her husband's death. The Duke has the credit of having founded the Bodliean Library. His nephew Beaufort 'twere as just to deem An agent too,—his constant wrangling strife, Embitter'd the deceased protector's life. Beaufort not long survived, at it should seem And left, sans sign of grace, this world's unequal dream. Affairs in France proceed as ill as ever, Normandy, Gascony, their interests sever; While Somerset in France is losing ground, At home dissentions and distrust abound. The Duke of York that flame 'gins light, Which, fed by Roses red and white, Produced to hundreds, then unborn, Many a sharp and burning thorn; Accused of good Duke Humphry's end, Suffolk is banished; on his way a friend Of York's, turn'd pirate, as 'tis said, Makes Suffolk shorter by the head. And now, disunion's cause to aid, “Lord of Misrule,” comes famed Jack Cade; And thus the essence of his doctrine ran, And, thus inscribed, his standard graced the van: “When Adam delv'd, “And Eve span, “Who was then “A Gentleman?” “Now am I master of London.” said Cade, striking his staff upon London-stone. He had been a dependant on Sir Thomas Dacre, in Sussex, and lately returned from France, whither he had fled in consequence of having murdered a woman and her child. Rymer. With Johnny decent dress or education Were 'clep'd high treason 'gainst the nation; And every mortal that could read or spell, By axe or halter swang or fell. For taking peoples nobs off, Jack took pride in: Yet changed his tone, Just as his own Was going to be cropp'd by Mister Iden; Who for the death of this high, low, Commander, Was, by King Henry, dubb'd Sir Alexander. Vic'try continues on the French to smile, And we lose Talbot and the valiant Lisle: Now York and Lancaster with fury glow, And Roses, red and white, alternate blow. York heads St. Alban's battle, and the King, Wounded, defeated, and in rebel hands, Begins, as Avon's swan doth sweetly sing, To envy peasants on his humblest lands. The Duke of York protector they create, And on a thread depends King Henry's fate; Next year the new protector is displaced, And Henry, once more, with dominion graced: Now mark a strange reverse, the Frenchmen land At Sandwich, fifteen thousand from their band In Devonshire and Cornwal too, to make Reprisals on old England they begin, And unprotected spoil they burn or take; Thus have we war without, and war within. York, at Bloreheath, in sanguinary fight, Depress'd the red rose, to exalt the white; At Ludlow battle Henry's fortune led, To crush the white and elevate the red; Northampton's contest turns the scale again, A fatal field to Harry and his reign. When treacherous Ruthyn, most disloyal Grey, Deserting, changed the fortune of the day, The King again is prisoner, and the crown Decreed to pass to York's descendants down; But martial Margaret, on Wakefield's plains, Her husband's honor manfully regains; York, late triumphant, fierce defeat appals, And crimsoned o'er, “the white rose leader falls.” Edward his son his better fortune tries, At Mortimer's Cross. And fickle vict'ry from Henry flies; The Queen again essays the doubtful field, And now once more the white rose banners yield. This second battle of St. Alban's fought, Redeem'd the captive King, but still it brought No true advantage:—London chose to name Edward of York their Sovereign, he came: The shadow only of poor Hal remain'd, Who from this time in substance never reigned. After events which Edward's life will tell, By crooked Gloucester's sword King Henry fell. A man, tho' weak, of pious, blameless life, Foil'd by his friends, and governed by his wife; The last a foible you may often see In other folks besides him, you, or me. Eaton and Cambridge each a College owe To Henry's bounty. Queen Margaret founded Queen's College, Cambridge; Archbishop Chicheley, All Souls and Bernard's College, Oxon; and Wainfleet, Bishop of Winchester, founded Magdalen College there. Of no man the foe, Unless it were himself, He deemed each woe He suffered here, correction kindly sent From Heaven, in lieu of future punishment, A gracious earnest given to insure Him bliss, where bliss can only long endure. To a Ruffian who struck him in the face, while prisoner, he only said, “Forsooth you do wrong to strike your anointed King;” and when some ladies appeared at a masque with their necks apparelled too much like our modern fashion, he exclaimed with characteristic simplicity, “Fie, fie, for shame—in sooth you are to blame.” END OF VOL.

EDWARD THE FOURTH. King Edward was handsome, was gay, debonair, His foes found him warlike, abroad in the field; When he conquer'd the brave, he could vanquish the fair, And to beauty in turn was too oft known to yield. Yet some time elapsed e're his festival reign Was permitted to revel in safety and peace; For Henry yet claimed his paternal domain, Nor did Margaret's praise-worthy energies cease. By succour assisted from Scotland and France, Once more with her boy against York she makes head; And the banner of Henry is seen to advance By the Queen, La Varenne Seneschal of Normandy. and bold Somerset led. At Hexham the Marquis of Montague meets The heroine, true to her sovereign lord; And spite of it's valour, her army defeats, When happy the soldier who 'scapes from his sword. Deserted, on foot, o'er the desolate wild, No roof to preserve from a storm-boding sky, Poor Margaret wanders; and presses her child To a bosom half bursting with agony's sigh. And “is there no help!” cried the sorrowing Queen, “For the son of a father so mild and so good? “No cottage to shield from the night blast so keen, “No guard to protect from the bands of the wood? “In battle these nerves were with fortitude braced, “And for thee, dearest boy, cou'd each danger despise; “Now foil'd and defeated, proscribed and disgraced, “The woman returns and the heroine flies.” “You fly not by heaven,” exclaim'd an unknown, “'Till your wealth I'm possess'd of whate'er your degree; “The world is my kingdom, this forest my throne, “None pass it unless they pay tribute to me. “Deceit of false friends while prosperity smiled, “Despoil'd me of all I had power to give; “Now just retribution for kindness beguil'd, “Demands in return, on mankind I should live. “They call me a robber, the proud ones who dare “To plunder their Sov'reign, his child, and his wife; “Of his crown they King Henry to rob did'n't spare, “Yet for poor crowns that I seize the law takes my life. “No words then, your riches my risk must repay, “Their wealth all bear with them in times such as these; “Yours seems to add weight to the cares of the way, “And what gives you such pain, I can carry with ease. The boy in her mantle she closely had prest, Now close and more close, as the savage drew nigh; And thinking some treasure she clasp'd to her breast, He seiz'd her, while she, with hysterical cry: “Intruder! the son of your master respect, “The offspring of Henry the mild and the good; “His mother demands that your Prince you protect “From white-rose assailants who thirst for his blood! “With feelings electric, amazed and subdued, “With rev'rence the ruffian to earth bent his knee; “And he, who late threaten'd in accents so rude, “Entreated permission her champion to be. “And safely he led them thro' thicket and brake, “To the hut of a peasant whose heart like his own, “Form'd faithfully loyal, for loyalty's sake, “Adhered to a Prince tho' bereft of his throne.

In short period after, found means to depart; And tho' haply too poor to make royal amends, Her guides met reward, for—they each had a heart. Henry, from overcaution, Scotland leaves, England he seeks in unpropitious hour: Where, prisoner made, that want of faith hegrieves, Which gives him mournful lodging in the Tower. “Sir James Harrington discovered the forlorn monarch while dining at Waddington Hall, Lancashire, and brought him to Town with his legs tied to the stirrups; for this service Edward gave the knight many manors, which Henry VII. took away from him.” Habington—Stow—Nugæ Antiquæ, &amp;c. Edward most wisely to detach From Margaret the Gallic court's protection, The famous Earl of Warwick with dispatch, Sends to King Louis to propose a match, Between the Princess Bona and himself. But by a sudden turn of new affection, That prudent plan was laid upon the shelf; And, ere Lord Warwick could have well arrived, The King was by an English subject wived. For it fell out one day, That Widow Grey “This beautiful widow was the daughter of Jacqueline, Duchess of Bedford, by her second husband, Lord Widville, and had been married to Sir John Grey, of Groby, She told Edward when he add essed her, that “though too humble to be his wife, she was too high to become his concubine.” There are doubts whether Warwick's defection was not less on account of this marriage, than from an unprincipled attempt of Edward's to seduce the daughter or niece of (Warwick) his benefactor.” Hall. Having a suit about her children's lands: So played her part, The Monarch's heart, Plump as a partridge, popp'd into her hands. Now against Edward's folly wagg'd each tongue; And yet the widow, tho' they say, And truly too, that she was grey, Was well-bred, witty, beautiful and young. But Kings, 'tis quite as hard as it is true, Areborn to wed—with love they've nought to do. Warwick and Louis fool'd in such a fashion, Flew in a passion; Warwick espous'd King Henry's cause, and thus Louis' best men, And mighty Margaret, (herself an host When at her post,) Upon the sea the red rose flag exalted; And never halted Till French and English, pied a terre, were ready To shout “Vive Henry,” and “Down with Neddy.” (A brief parenthesis permit, to say, Warwick had been the luckiest of his day, Let him of what he would be undertaker; And in those revolutionary ups and downs, He so did settle and unsettle crowns, They, not unaptly, styled him “the King-maker.”) Ev'n Edward's brother, Clarence, joins the Earl, And York's Archbishop, Oxford, Somerset, In Henry's name their banners proud unfurl; And Montague, who late in anger met The Queen at Hexham, now her cause espouses. While Englishmen, by so long feud opprest, And wishing very much to be at rest, With reason cry “A plague of both your houses!” Near Banbury King Edward gets a beating, Taken by Warwick, they with care convey His Majesty to Yorkshire; whence, defeating His keeper's vigilance, he finds the way To join his friends at Stamford.—Victory Field Pieces are first mentioned as used at this battle:— “The King sparkled the enemy with his ordnance, slew many of the commons, and thereby gained the victory.” Leland. Changes again her side; with Warwick fly Clarence and Co. to France, supplies and aid She amply lends, and such dispatch is made That Edward yields in turn, deposed, o'erthrown, And Warwick sets on Henry's head the crown. A little year, scarce more, a King was he, E're ecce it'rum, Edward o'er the sea Brings men and means, at Ravenspur he lands, And modestly his dukedom but demands; 'Till fickle Clarence J.P. Andrews says, “No scenes in Pantomime could be shifted more nimbly than those of this year.” from poor Hal secedes, Again in civil strife old England bleeds, 'Till Barnet's bloody field closed Warwick's power And life, The Marquis of Montague fell in striving to rescue his brother Warwick. The Duke of Exeter, who had been the greatest subject under Henry VI. and reduced to begging in his cause, perished in attempting to escape. Fabian, who lived at this period, says, he was by the King's servants incontinently slain. Hall says, that they who stood about, viz. Clarence, Gloucester, Dorset, and Hastings, suddenly murdered the Prince. Fabian also says, from “common fame,” that Henry was killed by the Duke of Gloucester; while Horace Walpole observes, Mob stories, or Lancasterian forgeries, ought to be rejected from sober history. Vide B. De Moleviele.—while Edward re-ascends the throne; The changeling court again his sceptre own, And Henry, fortune's fool, beholds the tower. With one most desp'rate fatal effort more, The unsubdued, tho' often conquer'd Queen, The fields of Tewkesbury imbues with gore. And, wou'd some kinder duty mine had been, Than tell how Edward, royal Margaret's son, Gracing the train of him the day who won, With words, becoming such a Prince, address'd Proud “Edward, Clarence, Glos'ter, and the rest,” Who (gall'd, the glorious filial lad should dare Speak like his honor'd father's rightful heir), “Buried their fatal daggers in his breast.” And, hapless Henry! now thine hour is come, Relentless Richard has pronounced thy doom; Destroy'd by him, as most historians tell, “After life's fitful fever he sleeps well,” And, kinder hearted monarch never fell! For Margaret—permit that here The Muse should claim an honest tear; Unyielding matron in thine infants cause! Great Queen! had Hal possessed but half thy nerve, Thou had'st not needed gain that sound applause, Thy princely actions ever will deserve. Imprison'd, shame on't, 'till her ransom paid, Unkingly souls! who cou'd a price demand; Heroic Margaret, by foreign aid, Return'd in sorrow to her native land. Returned to mourn the sad mistaken day, Ambition taught her tow'ring soul to stray, And charmed her from her household gods away. Edward takes Berwick from the Scot, Then hies to France in angry mood, But, at Pecquigni, quarrels are forgot, And England, rare to say, has truce from blood; Save where his arts intriguing Glo'ster tries, And Clarence, victim of a brother, dies. 'Tis strange in Ned, who loved the fair, we find, At once a tender and terrific mind, Lib'ral in love, and brave,—upon the whole He own'd a very little sort of soul.

For mere assertion that his only son Was heir to it, his forfeit life lays down; Pity that Edward e'er a crown had won.

EDWARD THE FIFTH. “'Twas at the silent midnight hour,” When deeds of murder vainly try To shun all-seeing Heaven's eye, And awful darkness wrapt the Tower Where innocence was doom'd to die; That crook-soul'd Richard's ruffian crew, Starting at every hollow gust that blew, Through vaulted passage stole, and arch-way low, Where shadows mock'd the flickering taper's glow, And, e'en the noise their felon steps impart, Struck nameless terror to each coward heart! Ah, sweetly then two royal infants slept, Whose guardian Angels would have wept; Did Angels weep? not for the fate of those, They waited soon to waft to God's repose. But for the poor deluded men who sold Their everlasting hopes for cursed gold; And for his deep perdition who could lull His conscience to commission of such deeds, For whom some victim daily bleeds, E're yet the measure of his guilt be full! Chill silence reign'd, unless some rip'ling wave Of Thames with placid noise the fortress lave; Or echo mark the sentry's measured tone, Or haply of some prison'd wretch the groan, Pierces the guarded wall with half-distinguish'd moan. Then with averted look and panting breath, The wreckless ministers of death Approach the sleeping pair; unconscious they, And undisturbed by guilty conscience lay, 'Till by the suffocating pillow prest, Historians have many doubts as to the commission of this alledged murder;—one proof offered to the contrary is from a curious document, said to be the Coronation Roll of Richard III. from which it would appear that Prince Edward walked at his Uncle's coronation. The entry is as follows: “To Edward, Son of the late King Edward the Fourth, for his apparel and arraye, that is to say,—a shorte gowne, made of two yards and three-fourths crymsyn clothe, of golde, lyned with two yards three-fourths of blac velvet; a long gowne, made of six yards of crymsyn clothe, of golde, lyned with six yards of green damask; a doublet and a stomacher, made of two yards of blac sattin, &amp;c. &amp;c.; besides two foot clothes, a bonnet of purple velvet and nine saddle housings of blue velvet, gilt spurs, with many other rich articles and magnificent apparel, for his henchmen or pages.”—The above is copied, with similar variations of orthography, (occurring in the same words) from the original, by Mr. Walpole, who was gratified with the perusal of it by Mr. Chamberlain, of the Great Wardrobe. Vide Bertrand de Moleville's Hist. of Gt. Britain. “It has, however, been suggested by Mr. Walpole himself, that these garments might probably have been intended for Edward the Fifth's Coronation, before Richard disclosed his designs.” Historic Doubts, and Answer. They changed their mortal for immortal rest. The fiends below with exultation fell, And glee infernal shout the royal knell; 'Till, Heaven corrected, they remain Cover'd in silence and accustom'd pain. Then, rising to extatic harmony, Celestial sounds that direful yell replace; While loud Hosannas rend the sky, And welcome virtue to the throne of grace! How on that night did Richard sleep? Ah! well for him might angels weep!

When Glo'ster, hump-back'd Prince, was young, While yet on fostering breast he hung, His mind being, like his body, made ill, The vices throng'd around his cradle; Exulting, sneering, grinning, fighting, They set his early teeth a biting; By turns they taught the embrio King To roar and cry for every thing; Once, while he slept and all were fired, Fill'd with fury, rapt, inspir'd From scenes of the succeeding age, Each fiend prophetic snatch'd a page; And, as they oft had shewn apart, Dark lessons of their forceful art, Each borrow'd from the future hour, Some victim of the tyrant's power; And mutually agreed to pry Into their darlings destiny. First Clarence came, his taste to try, (Near him a Malmsey butt they laid), Who back recoil'd, he knew not why, Even at the choice himself had made. George, Duke of Clarence, it is said, having been offered a choice as to the mode of his death, was by such melancholy election drowned in a butt of malmsey wine. Next Henry's Son, The gallant Prince Edward, murdered in cold blood after the battle of Tewkesbury. his eye on fire, With just reproof the tyrant stings, One savage blow speaks Richard's ire, And the youth soars on seraph wings. In woeful guise of sad despair, King Henry mourns his hopes beguil'd, 'Till Glo'ster's dagger ends his care, And sends the father to his child. But thou, O Hope! with eyes so fair, What was thy delusive measure? Still it whisper'd royal pleasure To Edward's son, and promis'd thrones and pow'r. Still did her voice the cheat prolong, While their fell uncle in the Tower, Thought fit to echo the deceitful song, And where of loyalty the theme she chose, His hypocritic voice was heard at ev'ry close; And York and Edward fell into the snare. And longer had she sung, but with a frown The Duke impatient rose, He threw his artful mask in fury down, And with a withering look, Of Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, and Grey Hastings, beheaded in the Tower for his attachment to the rights of the royal children; and the other three, their near relations, put to death at Pomfret. he took The lives: and bid his hellish agents do A deed so horrible and dread— Ne'er were half-stifled shrieks so full of woe, As when the fell assassins press'd Against each struggling infant's breast; And tho' some time each dreary pause between, Dejected pity at their side, Her soul subduing voice applied: Still on the couch of innocence they lean, 'Till each strain'd ball of sight announce the victims dead! Unsteady Buckingham, whose friendship fixed The crown on Richard, mourns his fallen state; His cup of death ungrateful Gloster mix'd, And one he cherish'd sells him to his fate. The Duke of Buckingham having levied a force against Richard, for evading certain promises made before he obtained the crown, was deserted by his army, and delivered to his enemy by the treachery of Ban ster, a confidential servant, who had been greatly obliged by the Duke. With eyes upraised, as one inspired, The Wife of Richard Ann, the Widow of Edward, Son of Henry VI. who unaccountably married her husband's murderer, by whom, it is supposed, her own death was hastened. sat retired; And, from her wretched regal seat, In notes by sorrow render'd sweet, Pour'd to Prince Edward's shade her plaintive soul; And deeply grieves that e'er she found, Like Eve, the soft beguiling sound Of the keen serpent's voice, which gently stole Within her heart, her duty to betray; When after once or twice refusing, Oh, woman's weakness! past excusing, She on the Crook-back threw herself away! But oh! how alter'd was the mournful tone, When Harry Richmond, arm'd with title true, His Baldrick 'cross his shoulder flung, And, with enliv'ning trumpet, blew A call to arms that thro' the island rung! His claim announcing to the English throne. Elizabeth, late Edward's Queen, With age so gay, and youth so green, To join his standard soon were seen; And Stanley inwardly rejoiced to hear, And Rice ap Thomas A Welch Chief, of great influence, who was one of the first to join Henry when he landed at Milford. seized his Cambrian spear. Last came Bosworth's warlike trial, Richard for his crown advancing; First to the soldiery some words address, But soon he saw brave Henry defy all, (And fighting, far than talking he lov'd best). They might have thought, who heard the fray, That in dark Pandæmonium's shade, All Milton's dæmon's were array'd; Such clang of arms, and coursers prancing. While, as on sounding shield the faulchion rings, Death, in his ebon car, drove fiercely round; And Richard's corse Richard's body, after being exposed, was buried in the church of the Grey Friars, in Leicester. Henry VII. bestowed a monument on it, which was demolished at the dissolution of Abbies, under Henry VIII; and the monarch's stone coffin actually served for a horse-trough, at the White Horse Inn: Sic transit gloria mundi! among the slain was found! And Henry on that well fought day, His worth and valour to repay, Received a crown upborne on Vict'ry's wings. Just at this scene young Glo'ster 'woke, And begg'd, not relishing the joke, His tutors would so civil be, As alter the catastrophe. But that which is decreed by fate, Must surely happen, soon or late; And what, as fiction has been stated, All came to pass, as we've related.

In my trap I take some every way, by Towns and Castles I take my rent: I will not respite an hour of a day, before me they must be present; I flea all with my mortal knife, And, of duetye, I take the life.

HENRY THE EIGHTH. Tyrannic cruelty, voluptuous pride, Insatiable licentiousness and guilt, So share this monarch, we can ne'er decide On what one vice his ruling wish was built. The rich Exchequer of his niggard sire, The treasure of those minions doomed to die, Empson and Dudley. Who found, as sings the bard we most admire, “It is but squeezing sponges and they dry” All prov'd but insufficient, for, behold! At Guisnes, The place where Henry, and Francis I. of France met, was, from the unexampled and prodigal splendor of the two Courts, called “The Field of Cloth of Gold.” where France and England met In dazzling panoply of gold, Three days of pleasure cost whole years of debt. Two Queens divorced, of six the tyrant wed, Two made good women, losing each a head; One happier, tho' unhappy wife, Died, giving our sixth Edward life. And Harry meant, no doubt, his last Should share the fate of consorts past; But that the arrogantly cruel elf, Met with a little accident between His plan and execution,—for I ween— He died himself. His vanity we must not overlook, Fool, like myself, his highness wrote a book; And when Pope Leo read it, no one knew Which most was to be pitied of the two. Leo, who for a critic, was quite tender, Dubb'd Henry, for his work, the “faith's defender;” Hal in return, which was not quite so civil, Defied alike the Popedom and the Devil. The Reformation was said to be owing to a jest made by Sir Thomas Wyatt, who, when Henry was waiting for the Pope's assent to his divorce, said “Lord! that a man cannot repent him of his sins without leave from the Pope.” Thus Wyatt hinted, Cranmer opened, and the Universities made, the way to the Reformation. Vide “An Englishman's History of England.” Know ye that magic minstrel Walter Scott? (Who, that knows aught of genius, knows him not?) Feel ye not yet the exquisite delight, With which ye read his tale of Flodden fight? Where Surrey triumph'd in bluff Harry's reign, At this period an account was kept of the diabolical mischiefs perpetrated by the armies invading Scotland, with all the regulatity of a tradesman's ledger.

Then who shall dare attempt the theme again? Not I, “by my laurels,” my verse near his lay, “Like the flowers of the forest wou'd wither away.” What sounds of merriment assail the ear? What glitt'ring mass of mingled church and state? And see, the master of the feast appear,— 'Tis Wolsey, thoughtless of his future fate! Like a red meteor we behold him soar, Extinguish'd now he falls to rise no more. Of Dunstan, Becket, Wolsey, having read, I think it may with safety thus be said:— Three prelates, by three different Sovereigns bred, Their masters and the people have misled; The first in monkish cruelty surpast, The next in arrogance, in both the last; The pride of priestcraft cou'd no farther go, To make a third she joined the other two. John Skelton, Poet Laureat to King Henry VIII. attacked Cardinal Wolsey without mercy, for his upstart insolence, and in his uncouth, but nervous doggrel, did his utmost to render him ridiculous, thus—No man dare come to th' speche, Of this gentile Jacke-breche; Of what estate he be, Of sp'ritual dignitie— Nor duke of hye degree. Nor marquis, earle, or lorde, Which shrewdly doth accord: That he, borne so base— All nobles should outface; His count'nance like a cayser, My lord is not at layser. Sir, ye must tarry astounde, 'Till better layser be founde; Sir, ye must dance attendaunce, And take pacient sufferaunce; For my lorde's grace, Has now, nor time, nor place, To speak with you as yet. And so they may sit, or flit, Sit, or walk, or ride, And his layser abide; Perchance, half-a-yere,— And yet be never the nere, &amp;c. Vide J. P. Andrew. Next Cromwell, worthy of a better end, Foe to idolatry, religion's friend; Capricious Henry! all your wish obtain'd, By your command the cloister'd coffers drain'd; 164 suppress'd monasteries, 90 colleges, 2374 chauntrys and chapels, and 110 hospitals produced a revenue of £161,100 to the crown: from which fund some additional colleges and professorships were given to the universities, and 6 new bishopricks were erected. The common people were much displeased with the stoppage of that hospitality the monks were used to exercise: there is an old ballad called “Truth and Ignorance,” the latter, who is represented as a rustic, says—“Ch'll tell the what, good fellowe, “Before the vriars went hence, “A bushel of the best wheate, “Was zold for vourteen-pence. “And vorty egges a penny. “That were both good and newe; “And this, che say, myselfe have seene, “And yet I am no Jewe.” With ingrate bitterness you turn your back, And leave poor Cromwell to his foes attack. How fleeting are the hours of wealth and fame, How more than fleeting, popular acclaim; The nation's idol and the King's delight, A felon's death resigns to endless night. Superior Cranmer in a crowd alone, Dares friendship with the virtuous fall'n own Cromwell had clung to Wolsey 'till his end, And Heaven repays him with as fast a friend. Take a true sample, how the man who late Fed twice each day two hundred at his gate, Was branded with imaginary crimes; And learn, ye too secure, from genuine rhymes, That fickle minds will change as change the times.

He desired the Lieutenant of the Tower to see him safe up to the scaffold, and leave him, at coming down, to shift for himself.

We do not imagine the following description could apply to any of the Wives of Henry: but it is given by Andrews as “an Example of the Quaint turn of the Times,” with respect to the Poetry of this Reign,The Attentive Spouse. Twelve sortes of mete my wife provides, And bates me not a dyshe; Foure are of flesh, of fruite are foure, The other foure of fyshe.

As the Mimosa from ungentle hand, Recoiling, closes quick its trembling leaves: So shrinks the muse to sing her native land Sway'd by remorseless bigotry.—It grieves My inmost heart to read a mind so fell, Found room in any British form to dwell; And more it irks me still to think, A sex which forms the intermediate link 'Twixt men and angels, e'er shou'd own The blood-stain'd animal, whose throne, For six disgraceful and polluted years, Saw Superstition's fires, unquench'd by Virtue's tears. Black shades of Bonner, Gardiner, arise! Lo! where above your narrow, murd'rous pride, Spirits ætherial soar, whose worth you dared despise; See white-rob'd Latimer, by Cranmer's side, Hooper and Ridley, leading martyrs blest, Who feel, (could angels ever feel distrest,) Sorrow that this our much-lov'd parent earth, To souls so very mean as your's gave birth. How sensitive are we of latter times! How senseless they in such an age of crimes? We start to tumult at a patriot word, And draw, and dare, for liberty, the sword. They, for their God, saw dearest friends expire, And trembling crouch'd around the impious fire; Had modern souls illum'd their coward clay, And turn'd their firelight into reason's day, Goodness the flame of guilt had never fed, But injured innocence, by justice led, Had hurl'd each brand on the oppressor's head. The wolf, sheep clad, by vengeance brought to quake, Had found a gibbet where he placed a stake. Reader, mistake not what my warmth express'd, Tumult I hate, licentiousness detest; Yet sure that nation which so much delights In Magna Charta, and the Bill of Rights; Who taught by sad experience Charles and James, That Law and Freedom are no empty names; Ought to have risen with the purest zeal, And made unfeeling Superstition feel; Driven Bigotry to native holes and caves, Prevented Martyrs from untimely graves; And thundered in the crosier'd butcher's ear, That Mary and her Philip both might hear, Britons are free, and never will be slaves! When Edward's death left Mary England's Queen, Jane Grey, unfortunate, (and less to blame Than they who, tempted by Ambition's shene, O'erruled her to assume the regal name); For their default who taught her to aspire, Fell victim with her husband The Lord Guildford Dudley. and his sire.

Spanish Prince Philip wrote our Queen a letter, Saying he wish'd for such a wife, Swearing he lov'd her more than life: Not mentioning he loved—the English crown much better. When landed on our coast, we're told, He drew his sword with action bold; Nor sheath'd it, even when Southampton's Mayor At meeting knelt, and made an humble prayer, That Philip wou'd assume the township's keys, Who, without speaking, stood at ease; Like a tired soldier after a review, As if our condescension was his due. Ah! little did the great Eliza think, (Who then was peeping thro' some cloister'd chink), How, at a future time, she'd give a banging To that same Philip, who so proud, Stood sword in hand among the crowd, And heard with nonchalance the Mayor's haranging. Ah! little thought Iberia's nation, How Britain's wou'd, in days now come, Oppose of Spain's worst foe the usurpation, And list their patriots with an English drum. What British feelings were at Philip's coming, By way of respite from my own humdrumming, I'll give in couplets written at the time; By which you'll know, That years ago, Politic reasons were express'd in rhyme. SAMPLES OF CLERICAL POETRY IN QUEEN MARY's REIGN. Verses on the Marriage of Philip and Mary. Vide Fox's Book of Martyrs. BY WHITE, BISHOP OF LINCOLN. The devil, that old enemy to mankind, Strives to prevent, tho' to it God's inclined, That Mary, England's Queen, should join her hands, To Spanish Philip, in hymeneal bands. Against the match, with the dark prince of night, The helpless Scots and timrous French unite, With these hell's prelates join Caiaphas' race; Eight married fathers, void of heavenly grace, John Dudley, Wyatt, and rebellious Kent, With Gray conspired the marriage to prevent. But that the nuptials should performed be, Cæsar and Flanders vow'd, and Italy, Catholic bishops, and with these comply Five holy fathers, for their sanctity In fetters bound; the senate of the nation, And all true Catholics in ev'ry station; Lords, Commons, learned, ignorant, and we, 'Cause God himself doth thereunto agree. When Philip and Queen Mary shall be joined, Their blood its wonted course shall run refined. PARODY ON THE ABOVE, BY WAY OF ANSWER. BY THE BISHOP OF NORWICH. That Mary should to Spanish Philip wed, And England's glory be extirpated; The devil wills, jointly with him agree All Flanders, Italy, and Germany. Caiaphas' race, the mitred company Of popish bishops,—five for impiety In prison cast.—But God's extended arm Kindly supports us, and averts the harm, He nills the match, gives England liberty. With him the warlike Scots and French agree, Eight married in the Lord; and Dudley, you Foreboding dismal things, the marriage view, The sanate nills.—Brave Wyatt doth espoue, With pious zeal, his country's injured cause; With him Grey and the Kentish folks comply, Either to gain their liberty or die! Then say, what profits will the Spanish King, Having wedded Mary, to the English bring? [Altho' I am not tired of my task] Altho' I am not tired of my task, Yet you may be of reading, then take breath; And suffer me with due respect to ask, Wou'd'nt you rather quit this reign, Of credit lost and tyrant gain, To read the golden days of great Elizabeth. It may be first as well to say, That Mary chanced to die one day; Mary wrote and published several devout Pieces and Letters. Catalogue of Royal Authors. If any grieved, it was an undertaker, Who at her funeral did sigh and sob, Not for the Queen whose breath did then forsake her, But, for a brother tradesman got the job. Sweet Shakespeare tells us that a rose “By any other name” would charm the nose: But Bonner's memory, I fear, By no means e'er will charm the ear; His name avails not tho' he turn it To more appropriate Bishop Burnet; Or should the badness of the pun amaze, To make it worse let's call him Bishop Blaze. “A virgin Queen the regal sceptre swayed, “And fate itself her sov'reign pow'r obeyed, “The wise Eliza, whose directing hand “Had the great scale of Europe at command; “And ruled a people that alike disdain, “Or freedom's ease, or slav'ry's iron chain.” Smollet's Voltaire. “O the golden days of good Queen Bess.” Collins's Evening Brush. “Cantate Domino, Canticum novum.” Chaunted by, mitred Sycophants of the former Reign four times in fourteen years.

Who lov'd Lord Essex 'bove his Peers, And cut his head off, (tho' with tears), Of which, alive, she box'd the ears, O fie, sir. When her Majesty was moved, she swore heartily, and was by no means sparing of her blows;—the history of the chastisements bestowed by her hand, from the first recorded when entering the Tower to certain death as she thought, she dashed her conductors offered cloak from her; to the last bitter shake she bestowed on the malicious Nottingham, including her menacing Sir James Nevil with her fist, when he surprised her playing on the virginals; the blows lavished on her maids of honour, and the box on the ear received by Essex, might afford amusement.—Mary Queen of Scots also accuses her of having beaten a Lady named Scudamore, so violently as to break her finger; and cutting another across the hand with a knife. Civil and Military History of England. Who might with mighty King's have married, Whose suits, however back'd, miscarried; And yet who doubts a maid she tarried? Not I, sir. Whose merry maidens fared, with glee, On beef and beer, not toast and tea, Whenever hungry they might be, Or dry, sir? Who, when the puff'd up priest of Rome Said Spain should seal cursed England's doom, Cried, bless you, let their donships come And try, sir?

Who, not your decent ears to shock, Swore that by G—she wou'd unfrock A bishop,—and then give his flock A wiser. There is a curious letter of the Queen's written to a Bishop of Ely, and preserved in the register of that See; it is in these words:—“Proud Prelate, I understand you are backward in complying “with your agreement: but I would have you know, that “I who made you what you are can unmake you, and if you do “not forthwith fulfil your engagements, by God I will unfrock “you.

Thou causedst the guilty to be loosed From bonds, wherein are innocent's inclosed; Causing the guiltless to be strait reserved, And freeing those that death had well-deserved; But by her envy nothing can be wrought, So God send to my foes all they have thought. Elizabeth, Prisoner. A.D. MDCL. [I grieve, yet dare not shew my discontent] The succeeding Stanzas, from the Ashmolean Museum, signed “Eliza Regina, upon Mount Zeurs departure,” may serve to show the state of Elizabeth's heart, and the strength of her passions at fifty-two, when, it is supposed, she entertained “an uncontrolable passion, which carried her very absurd lengths,” for the Duke of Anjou, between whom and herself a treaty of marriage had been nearly concluded. Civil and Military History of Great Britain. I grieve, yet dare not shew my discontent; I love, and yet am forced to seem to hate; I dote, but dare not say I ever meant; I seem stark mute, but inwardly do prate. I am, and not,—I freeze, and am yet burned; Since from myself my otherself I turned. My care is like my shadow in the sun, Follows me flying; flies when I pursue it; Stands, and lies by me; does what I have done; This too familiar care doth make me rue it. No means I find to rid him from my breast, Till by the end of things it be supprest. Some gentler passion steals into my mind, (For I am soft and made of melting snow); Or be more cruel, love, or be more kind; Let me, or float or sink, be high or low. Or let me live with some more sweet content, Or die, and so forget what love e'er meant.

Was James most fond of peace or fighting? A. Peace, study, and polemic writing. A Volume of his Works was published of Polemic Tracts, also Dæmonologia, and (by way of constrast) “A Counterblast to Tobacco;” and many pieces of poetry, Annotations, puns, scripture, wittiscims, superstition, oaths, vanity, prerogative and pedantry were the ingredients of all his sacred Majesty's performances. Catalogue of Royal Authors. Set little store by worldly riches, Believed in sorcery and witches; Religion in his breast by turns, Is lukewarm or with ardour burns; Zealous and cold he scorns the devil, And cures, or tries to cure, the evil. Q. Were there no plots against his throne? A. For Arabella Stuart one; For which that jewel of Eliza's reign, Raleigh, incarcerated did remain Twelve years, then met an unexpected fate. The jealous Gondamar, ambassador from Spain.—Sir Walter's exploits against St. Thomas and other Spanish settlements made him an object of Iberian anger. Spaniards wrath, 'tis said, to sate, Yet Raleigh left a deathless name, To learning dear and dear to fame; For val'rous enterprize his life renowned, Intrepid in his death that life he crown'd; Nor will I apprehend rebuke that here, Penn'd by himself, his dying words appear.— “Ev'n such is time, which takes in truth, “Our youth, our joy, and all we have, “And pays us nought but age and dust, “When in the dark and silent grave. “When we have wander'd all our ways, “Shut up the story of our days; “And from which grave, and earth, and dust, “The Lord will raise me up, I trust. Q. Did Ararella fall in James's power? A. She did, and died while prisoner in the Tower. Q. Were other plans against the monarch framed? A. One, almost too atrocious to be named, Of most peculiar horror, which, the eye Of Providence o'erseeing, heaven thought good It's flame to stifle with the traitor's blood. Sir Everard Digby, Catesby, and a band Of matchless villains, murd'rously plann'd That King, Lords, Commons, at one dreadful blast, “No reck'ning made” with God, should breathe their last. Q. What saved the nation from so fell a scheme? A. Omnipotence alone, as it should seem, Inspired a number of the trait'rous horde, With caution's pen to warn a loyal Lord; Lord Mounteagle. Who, to his country and his sov'reign true, The scroll exposed, and foil'd the impious crew. Enquiry soon laid bare the embryo act, The bigot Faux Faux, Digby, Rookewood, Keys, Grant, Bates, and the two Winters, were hanged; Catesby, Percy, and the two Wrights, were slain in the endeavour to take them., detected in the act Of pre-arrangement, mourned his smother'd hope; The rest resisting fall, or grace the felon's rope. Faux, Digby, Rookewood, Keys, Grant, Bates, and the two Winters, were hanged; Catesby, Percy, and the two Wrights, were slain in the endeavour to take them. Q. Did James by commerce add to his domain? A.

Q. What favorites of noble note had James? A. Villiers Duke of Buckingham. and Car, Earl of Somerset. unequal to the names Of Verulam Sir Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam, and Viscount St. Albans the “Prophet of Arts, which Newton was sent afterwards to reveal.” Horace Walpole. and Raleigh, “sage grave men” Whose reputation scorns my feeble pen. Q. Had London of improvements any share? A. A river brought, by Middleton, from Ware; Each street and house most copiously supplied, And gave the hint to other plans since tried. Q. What else of moment does to James relate? A. No more than that he met our common fate; At Theobald's—Serene his British reign, Who liv'd sans effort, and who died sans pain. It is said, however, by Andrews, that he died not without suspicion of being poisoned by Lord Buckingham; the same author, observing on the Royal Line of Stuart, calls them a race as steadily unfortunate as ever were recorded in History; their misfortunes having continued, with unabated succession, during 390 years— of which he adduces the following melancholy proots: Robert III. broke his heart, because his eldest son, Robert, was starved to death; and his youngest, James, was made a captive. James I. after having beheaded three of his nearest kindred, was assassinated by his own uncle, who was tortured to death. for it. James II. was slain by the bursting of a cannon. James III. when flying from battle was thrown from his horse, and murdered in a cottage, into which he had been carried for assistance. James IV. fell in Flodden Field. James V. died of grief for the wilful ruin of his army at Solway Moss. Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, was assassinated, and then blown up, in his palace. Mary Stuart was beheaded in England. James VI (and First of England,) died under circumstances just related. Charles I. was beheaded at Whitehall. Charles II. was exiled for many years. James II. lost his crown, and died in banishment. Ann, after a reign, which though glorious, was rendered unhappy by party disputes, died of a broken heart, occasioned by the quarrels of her favoured servants. The posterity of James II. have remained wanderers in foreign lands. Antient and Modern Andcdotes by J. P.

CHARLES THE FIRST. While Raleigh wrote “The World” one dreary day, He heard, beneath his prison bars, a fray; But on enquiry, could not learn, forsooth, Which party err'd, or which declared the truth. The foil'd historian cast his pen aside, “Dare I presume old tales to tell,” he cried, “When, from what happens, almost in my sight, “I find no clue to teach me wrong from right?” If penetration, deep as his, could falter, I claim excuse enough,—I'm no Sir Walter.— Some writers of our martyr'd Charles believe He was religious, He wrote, also, and his works, after his death, published in a volume, intitled “Reliquiæ Sacræ Carolinæ; or, the Works of that great Monarch and glorious Martyr, King Charles I. both civil and sacred.” After the Restoration, his famous ????? ???????? was published, which went through forty-seven impressions, including 48,000 copies; “the greatest run,” says Burnet, “that any book has had in our age.” Catalogue of Royal Authors; Harris's Life of Charles I.; Burnet's History of his own Times. brave; wou'd ne'er deceive: Was affable, chaste, temp'rate, wise, nor can You take, than theirs, a nobler view of man. Others with pertinacity declare Him weak, oppressive, govern'd by the fair; Fond of prerogative, to fav'rites kind, Yet to his people's real int'rest blind. Haply could we with truth inspect his heart, We might behold some weakness claim a part; Where many a brilliant grace and virtue blend, Observed by many foes, and many friends. Unequal with an host, alas! to cope, Alternate prey to flattery, fear, and hope; The monarch's deeds should large allowance claim, With whom too often, to a nation's shame, Success is virtue, and misfortune, blame! The outset of the hapless monarch's reign, Was mark'd by war (bequeathed by James) with Spain; When Buckingham, our blood-stain'd records tell, By gloomy Felton's savage dagger fell. The northern presbytery, near and far, Cry “havock! and let slip the dogs of war;” And “league and covenant,” those terms of peace, Engender troubles, not for years to cease. Oh! for the force of Butler's biting pen, To stygmatize false zeal and hot brain'd men! The King takes arms,—the leaguers in a trice, Ask peace,—'tis violate,—and granted twice; One party roundly swear 'twas Charles who broke it, While cavaliers affirm the Scots provoke it. The English Parliament themselves proclaim Perpetual, and the royal acts disclaim; Degrade the King's best friends, his mandates mock, And sentence Laud and Strafford When the Lieutenant of the Tower offered Strafford a coach, lest he should be torn to pieces by the mob, in passing to execution, he replied, “I die to please the people, and I will die their own way.” Royal and Noble Authors. to the block.

OLIVER CROMWELL, PROTECTOR. Charles now no more, his best adherents fled, Or those who dare espouse the martyr's side, Or own the son of him unjustly dead, Like him the victim of rebellion died. Montrose thy loyalty and glorious lot Will, to thine honor, live when traitors are forgot; Scotland awhile deserves good men's applause, By kind adherence to the royal cause. The son of Charles essays to gain his right, 'Till all his hopes expire at Wor'ster fight; Derby! the scaffold by thy foes decreed, Graces the cause for which you nobly bleed. The “King enacts more wonders than a man,” Patient in suff'ring, hoping better fate; He proves that fortune, threaten what she can, Still never overcomes the truly great. Eclips'd, like Alfred, in a peasant's guise, He stoops to conquer, and submits to rise! And long shall May thy gilded honors bring, Kind Boscobel, the shelter of a King. Cromwell now seated in the ruling chair, To tell his virtues haply were but fair; But, not at present knowing what they were, We'll just sum up his actions, first premising, That, from our souls, we cannot help despising The wretch whose nonchalance, while Charles's fate Was canvass'd, with the cushion where he sate Play'd like a schoolboy,—when the fatal scroll Of death was signing, Cromwell, void of soul, In fiend-like sport, black characters could trace, With ink on his too black associates face. England's respect, her navy and her trade, In justice let us own he well supported; (But that his interest prompted.) and his aid, And close alliance more than once were courted.

Therefore, to please you, we'll look back again, And finish Cromwell's self-appointed reign. Regardless of promises, honor, and word, He Drogheda's garrison puts to the sword; At Dunbar and Wor'ster defeating the Scots, For slaves sells his pris'ners, to India, in lots. In private proposing to make himself King, He cou'dn't get colleagues in concert to sing; Rules over the English as Turks govern Moors, A senate first forms, and then kicks out of doors; Then fierce as Achilles, more bully than Hector, That Government cancels, which makes him Protector. The army maintained by this arrogant elf, Kept popular liberty all to himself; And, scorning to imitate Kings, he had houses More num'rous than they, or their sons, or their spouses: When fortune placed loyal men under his hands, Or rather his feet, as the true matter stands, If their heads he remitted, he cut off their lands. Ungrateful to him who inspir'd all he knew, (And to keep from his patron, the devil, his due) As sure as his dark highness looks over Lincoln, Noll made it high treason his death but to think on. Tho' much disappointed, not mounting a throne, He prank'd up a pert House of Peers of his own; Last, vext he'd nought further to flatter his pride, Like big Alexander, he manfully cried, And so had his court, but by good luck he died. “As honest as the skin between his brows.” Shakespeare. “Le Second Protecteur R.

RICHARD CROMWELL, PROTECTOR. This gentleman sat not two years in the chair, And we don't hear of much he effected while there; For Lambert and Fleetwood, and Parliament long, With the army, reduced all his pow'r to a song.

Hume. Who shall pourtray the horrors of that year, Which saw death-dealing Pestilence appear? When London's guardianGenius droop'd his head, To mourn o'er countless crouds untimely dead? Or who shall paint the all-devouring flame, Which left the capital an empty name?

Be it remember'd, a momentous fact, This reign produced the Habeas Corpus Act. And, much less creditable to the state, (But we must bad and good alike relate), Dunkirk to France disgracefully was sold, For some four hundred thousand pounds in gold; The kingdom's good thus lavish to support The enervating vices of the court. Cromwell and his most hypocritic crew, ('Tis fit the devil should receive his due), Altho' subversive of domestic law, Still kept our foreign enemies in awe; While Charles by stern adversity untaught, Bought folly,—and we paid for what he bought.

Bishop Burnet's History of his own Times. His quondam friends enquiry seem to shun, In haste to bow before the rising sun.

A great King, with strong armies and mighty fleets, a vast treasure, and powerful allies, fell all at once; and his whole strength, like a spider's web, was so irrecoverably broken with a touch, that he was never able to retrieve, what, for want of both judgment and heart, he threw up in a day.” Bishop Burnet's History of his own Times. “And when fairly turn'd out, only call'd it resigning.” T.

JAMES THE SECOND. Tho' poetry oft feigns, in sooth, We nought inscribe but homely truth Would we could mingle as we write With information more delight; And themes to fill our volume choose, Which might instruct and yet amuse; So should our pen be spared the pain Of tracing James the Second's reign. Two Parliaments he first commands, In north and southern British lands; To answer every stated want, Two millions revenue we grant. Scotia, on loyalty's best grounds, Adds near three hundred thousand pounds; Besides which the Scotch Parliament annexed the Duties of the Excise to the Crown for ever. Yet unpropitious in the main Commenced King James the Second's reign. Now cruelty her sway denotes, In doom severe of Titus Oates; Oates, Dangerfield, and others, had perjured themselves in accusing James, while Duke of York, of a plot against his brother; the Author by no means seeks to extenuate this man's guilt, but to throw deserved odium on the sanguinary severity with which corporal punishments were inflicted in this Reign; compared to many of which hanging or decollation had been mild and merciful. Burnet, and other respected Historians, tell us that James was naturally cruel; and when in Scotland, (in his Brother's Reign) where several were tortured before the Privy Council, to force confession relative to plots, and where, to use the Prelate's words, “the sight was so dreadful, that without an order restraining such a member to stay, the board would be forsaken, the Duke was so far from withdrawing, that he looked on, all the while, with indifference, and with an attention as if he had been to look on some curious experiment; this gave a terrible idea of him to all that observed it, as of a man that had no bowels nor humanity in him.” Who, tho' a perjured pedagogue, (When perjury was much in vogue) Was of his sacred order stripp'd, And, nearly to death's threshold, whipp'd; Mortal more smart did ne'er sustain Than he, in James the Second's reign. Next Monmouth, in unlucky time, With rebel banner lands at Lyme; At Taunton caus'd the bells to ring, While fools proclaim'd him England's King, But forced on Sedgemore plain to yield To Feversham, The Earl of Feversham defeated Monmouth, (whose plea was, that Mrs. Barlow, also called Lucy Walters, his mother, had been lawfully married to Charles II.); and the unfortunate Duke was beheaded a month and four days from his ill-advised landing. in hard fought field; His bold attempt proved rash and vain To shorten James the Second's reign.

Kirk caused ninety others to be executed at Taunton, his drums and trumpets playing in derision of their dying agonies.

William and Mary.—Battle of the Boyne.—Bill of Rights.— Queen Anne.—Victories of the Duke of Marlborough.— Whigs and Tories.—Union of the Kingdoms of England and Scotland.—Accession of the House of Brunswick. “Triumphant Nassau here we find, “And with him bright Maria join'd.” Addison. “Britain her safety to your guidance owns, “That she can sep'rate parricides from sons; “That, impious rage disarm'd, she lives and reigns, “Her freedom kept by him who broke her chains.” Prior. “—By turns they tell, “And listen, each with emulous glory fir'd, “How William conquer'd, and how France retir'd; “How Providence o'er William's temples held, “On Boyne's propitious banks, the heav'nly shield; “How Belgia, freed, the hero's arm confest, “But trembled for the courage which she blest. “Behold the soldier plead the monarch's right, “Heading his troops, and foremost in the fight.” Vide Prior. “How good she was, how gen'rous, how wise, “How beautiful her shape, how bright her eyes; “When her great Lord to foreign wars was gone, “And left his Mary here to rule alone, “With how serene a brow, how void of fear, “When storms arose, did she the vessel steer! “And when the raging of the waves did cease, “How gentle was her sway in times of peace: “Like heav'n, she took no pleasure to destroy, “With grief she punish'd, and she sav'd with joy.” Pomfret. “Yet fame shall stay and bend to William's praise, “Of him her thousand ears shall hear triumphant lays; “Of him her tongues shall talk, on him her eyes shall gaze.” Congreve. “To save Britannia to my darling son, “Immortal Nassau came; I hush'd the deep “By dæmons rous'd, and bade the listed wings “Waft the deliverer to the shore; “Then dawn'd the period destin'd to confine “The surge of wild prerogative; to raise “A mound restraining its imperious rage.” Thomson. WILLIAM and MARY. A joyous nation hail the royal pair! He, brave as merciful, she, good as fair; From ev'ry slavish apprehension freed, No more Opinion fears in chains to bleed: Nor, at the mercy of a legal brute, Endure the thumbscrew or tormenting boot; The Boot was an instrument of torture borrowed from the Continent. To honest joys each patriot's harp is strung, And thus some bard convivial might have sung, Had he, like me, the inspiring air to chuse, Which echoes the Anacreontic Muse Of Morris, fittest wight on social earth, With classic wreath to crown the hour of mirth; Had Morris wrote the song instead of me, How devilish glad my bookseller would be! AIR. TO “ANACREON IN HEAVEN.” To William in Belgia, far over the sea, A few sons of Freedom preferr'd a petition, That he their deliv'rer and sov'reign wou'd be; When this answer arrived, without let or condition: By your laws to abide, Shall be my first pride, While I lend you my name and my consort's beside, With the Sham'rock, the Thistle, and Rose, to entwine Sweet emblems of Union round Liberty's shrine. The news over Albion immediately flew, When Judge Jefferies pretended to give himself airs; If those traitors are suffered their scheme to pursue, Myself and some more may sneak down the back stairs. No longer fierce Kirk Can proceed with his work, To shoot, stab, and strangle folks, just like a Turk, If William and Mary are suffered to twine The emblems of Union round Liberty's shrine. If Roman nos'd Billy once strikes up his drum, We must sound a retreat in return, I'm afraid; Each brow-beating Big Wig, like me, must be dumb, And pack'd Juries pack off in defection of trade. But tho' we withdraw, Yet Mister Nassau May dread the whole force of an Action at Law; Prerogative's vengeance shall teach him to twine His emblems of Union round Liberty's shrine. Bishop Burnet got up, to his liturgy true, And vow'd with King William he'd cheerfully join; Too long, said the Prelate, a bigotted crew Have ruled, to Old England's disaster and mine. The system of assassination was a very favorite one in James's Reign. Bishop Burnet, if the Author of this Rhyming History understands his principles from reading his Memoirs of his times, seems to have acted with manly and pious sincerity with respect to his religious tenets; for which, although he left a country, where he refused dishonorable preferment, with the King's permission, he was legally, or rather illegally proceeded against. And when the States of Holland, where he married and was naturalized, refused to give him up, his life was threatened, and agents employed to take it; of which, among other friendly and authentic notices, he received the following, from Captain Barter, a gentleman of unquestioned honor and reputation, whose father was at that time Steward to the Duke of Ormond: Hague, 14th March, 1688. “Dear Sir, “Though I have no acquaintance with you, yet the esteem I have for your character, and the benefit I have received by your works, obliges me to tell you the proceedings against you in England. I happened the other day to go into the Secretary's Office, where I saw an order for three thousand pounds, to be paid the person that shall destroy you. I could hardly believe my eyes that I saw the paper, it seemed so strange to me. This I communicated in private to my Lord Ossory, who told me it was true, for he had it from Prince George. My Lord desired me to be private in the thing 'till I came to Holland, and then, if I pleased, to tell you of it: Sir, I am your friend, and my advice to you is, to take an especial care of yourself, for no doubt but that great sum will meet with a mercenary hand. Sir, you shall never want a friend where I am.” Nassau who delights In peace, tho' he fights, Will redress our sad wrongs with a good Bill of Rights; With the Laurel, the Olive, and Myrtle he'll twine The emblems of Union round Liberty's shrine. Then Jefferies be silent, for faith you had need, Since you and your colleagues committed those crimes Which sullied your master, caused thousands to bleed, And call'd for an Orange to cool those hot times; Like his mind we suppose, His Majesty's nose Truly Roman, his creed tho' is tout antre chose, As you'll find when he gloriously comes to entwine The emblems of Union with Liberty's shrine. One fifth of November, a gunpowder plot Went off 'ere its sting it had pow'r to display; Our fifth of November will ne'er be forgot, When freedom her ensign unfurl'd in Torbay; “Nolumus mutari,” Our laws ne'er shall vary, Cried Britons, when welcoming William and Mary, Who landed the Olive and Myrtle to twine, With emblems of Union round Liberty's shrine. Then ne'er may the fruit of that landing be lost, And long may Britannia with gratitude own, The views of her enemies ne'er were so crost, As when William and Mary ascended the throne. May the throne long endure, And it's virtues ensure That union which only these realms can secure, While the Sham'rock, the Rose, and the Thistle, entwine, Peace, Commerce, and Plenty, round Liberty's shrine. Aided by France, the self-expelling King Seeks Ireland with a well appointed host; And fulminating proclamations ring, With mingled clang of arms round Erin's coast. Towns Kilmore, Coleraine, Inniskilling, Londonderry, &amp;c. &amp;c. were beseiged by one or both parties, and desperately contested. won and lost precede the eventful day, When William, leaving to his Consort's care Which well she husbanded, the regal sway, Hastens the perils of the war to share. The crown'd opponents meeting either side, With cautious tactic for the fight provide; Here Berwick's Duke on James's quarry stands, Tyrconnel there leads bold Hibernian bands; And Hamilton, whose bearing more were prized, But that his honor, falsely compromised, Was pledged for William with the foe to treat, While friendship's sacred garb concealed deceit, General Hamilton had been accredited from King William to make proposals to the Earl of Tyrconnel; he betrayed his trust, and joined him. He behaved most gallantly in the field, and was wounded. When taken prisoner, and brought before the King, he was asked whether he thought the Irish would make any further resistance; he answered, “Upon my honor I believe they will, for they have still a good body of horse.” William, eying him significantly, replied, “Your honor! Your honor!” and turned away. He afterwards ordered his wounds to be taken care of. Burnet, Field of Mars, &amp;c. Lauzan and Hocquencourt, in proud array, Their Gallic and Helvetian ranks display; A chosen squadron cautious James protects, Who from a distant hill the war directs. Opposing, see brave William's banner fly, In all the hope of coming victory; Nassau beneath, from rank to rank imparts The fire of valour to his soldiers hearts. Nassau who on that day's impatient eve Such mark'd escape from slaughter found, William had part of his clothes, and the flesh of his shoulder, carried away the night before the battle, while in a reconnoisance. This was observed on the opposite side of the river by James's Army; the death of William proclaimed with loud shouts; the news sent off to France; and Paris was actually illuminated on the occasion. Field of Mars, &amp;c. That foes, who what they wish believe, And France (her subjects to deceive,) With gay illumination blazing round, And cannons far proclaiming sound, Gave note of what had not yet taken place: Nor yet reformed th' equivocating race! When Wellington her titled marshals bleeds, Their court gazettes describe what's done In terms reversed, and chronicle great deeds, Not of the victors, but of those who run. Close to the hero Schomberg's Duke Schomberg, when General Hamilton, at the front of King James, had nearly routed a wing of King William's army, put himself at the head of a corps of French Protestants; and, pointing to the enemy, said, “Gentlemen, these are your persecutors.” He then led them with an impetuosity which turned the fortune of the day in that quarter, though himself slain in the contest. His death was the more lamented, as he had parted from the Council of War rather hurt at the rejection of his advice with respect to the disposition of the field, in points where he was afterwards judged to have been correct. son and sire With warmth their own each patriot breast inspire; Here George, of Denmark, grasps a British lance, There gallant Ormond's fearless lads advance; They met, and Boyne's discolour'd wave Of many a bleeding corse becomes the grave. Little delights the Muse to dwell, With circumstance, on how they fell; Nor wields she a terrific pen, Each cloven helm to cleave again; Nor owns her wing such rapid flight, As wheel with whirl of faulchion bright; Nor in their lightning path she traces Death's leaden envoys to their places; Suffice to say that William won the field, Suffice to say that James, compell'd to yield, To shelt'ring Gaul renews his rapid flight And abdicates a second time his right. A pause you'll kindly grant us here, While Schomberg's memory claims a tear; Modest in council, dreadful in affray, His death had almost given James the day. To Dudley's offspring Schomberg ow'd his birth, He was descended of a noble family in the Palatinate, his mother was an English woman, daughter of Lord Dudley; he had served in Holland, England, France, Portugal, and Brandenburgh; he obtained the dignities of Mareschal in France, Grandee in Portugal, Generalissimo in Prussia, and Duke in England. And well he proved his demi-British worth, Princely his rank, intrepid, skilful, bold, In age a youth, in sage experience old; With him five hundred ting'd the reddening flood; For James near thrice that number shed their blood! Louis, pretending to assist King James, Lights up of civil wars again the flames; Fruitless his efforts, William's star presides, And each attempt against his crown derides. When England in her turn the war declares, For foreign scenes of strife the King prepares; Plots, still detected, would his life assail, By worthless means fore-doom'd by fate to fail. Frequent campaigns the hero's worth proclaim, Britain and Belgia echo with his name, And France reluctantly admits his fame. Yet fortune unalloy'd is not decreed, Man can, on earth, but partially succeed; Amid great William's struggles for renown His Mary gains an everlasting crown: Beam'd not the flatterers tear in Britain's eye, When Heaven's fiat doom'd the Queen to die. December 28th, 1694, of the small-pox. Solid piety, uncommon goodness, great sweetness of temper, majesty, an air of grandeur untinctured with pride or affectation, and the sincerest affection for her husband, are said to have characterised this excellent Princess. Genuine the sorrow felt by high and low, Most genuine his who keenest felt the blow; Call'd to the field again by Gallic foes, In war the widow'd King beguiled his woes. Namur, impregnable esteem'd 'till now, Before the British standard deigns to bow; More plots detected, their projector shames, And history blushes to suppose King James, Who threats another trial of his right, Almost—embarks—and then declines it quite! France sues; Nassau from his paternal seat, At Berwick arbitrates the peace they greet; France, faithless to her treaties, seizes Spain, A trick of late she tried, but tried in vain; The gauntlet iron war accepts again, Waves his red plume and joyous seeks the plain! When chance, or Heaven's high will for ends unknown, Robs of a brilliant jewel England's throne; Unites in realms above the royal pair, For Kings, who bless mankind, find certain blessing there. HOUSE of STUART. “Henceforth, she said, in each returning year, “One stem the Thistle and the Rose shall bear; “The Thistle's lasting grace, thou, O my Rose, shall be, “The warlike Thistle's arm a sure defence to thee.” Rowe. “Great Anna claims the song, no brighter name “Adorns the list of never-dying fame; “No fairer soul was ever form'd above; “None e'er was more the grateful nation's love, “Nor lov'd the nation more.” Parnell. “Ye active streams! where'er your waters flow, “Let distant climes and furthest nations know “What ye from Thames and Danube have been taught, “How Anne commanded, and how Marlbro' fought.” Prior. “Next to the Thunderer let Anna stand, “In piety supreme as in command; “Famed for victorious arms and generous aid, “Young Austria's refuge, and fierce Bourbon's dread. Lansdown. ANNE. “A Lady lived in former days, “That well deserv'd the utmost praise; “For greatness, birth, and justice famed, “And every virtue could be named.” So of the Queen sung Doctor King, And thus on many a lyric wing Her praises soar; while, to speak her due, Who most commended, said most true. King William's plan of continental war, The Queen and Commons, after stout debate, Resolve to second; hence that blazing star, Ruling of each campaign the fate, Bright Marlbro' rose, whose very name Half won the day where'er it came; Victorious still his banners flew, And on his helm spontaneous laurels grew; Imperial sov'reigns woo'd his worth, And graced the chief of British birth With principality; while Churchill's brow By Anne with ducal circle bound, Bade Envy's self submissive bow, And hail desert with genuine honor crown'd. At Donawert and Ramilies He thrash'd the French with skill and ease; At Oud'nard and Malplaquet beat 'em, At Blenheim bravely did defeat 'em, And in each place he chanced to meet 'em. Or Mildenheim or Marlbro' call'd, His presence still the foe appal'd, While grateful friends shall long revere, Churchill to patriot memory dear. So in our days, Rodrigo's chief, Ordain'd for sinking Spain's relief, For Britain's joy and Erin's fame, Born to acquire a Marlbro's name; Or by Iberian Dukedom praised, Or Lusitanian honors raised; Great Torres Vedras thy paternal throne, Attaches honor to thy name alone, And proudly calls a Wellin ton it's own! “Come gi's a sang, the lady cried, “And lay aw' yer disputes aside; “What nonsense 'tis for folk to chide, “For what's been done before 'em, “Let Whig and Tory Scotch Ballad. aye agree,” But Whig and Tory, friends, d'ye see, Wou'd not agree, and fierce began Their quarrels in the reign of Anne, Tho' of their origin we have some doubts, They surely were a sort of Ins and Outs; (Whate'er their designations may denote, Remember, reader, I'm no party minion). Tories for strict episcopacy vote, The Whigs for greater freedom of opinion: And it was said, in prose, by Doctor Swift, (Who had been known to give each side a lift,) Of Church and State who dearest deems Should carefully avoid extremes; Nor, for the former's sake, engage With Whiggish violence or rage; Nor less, for State's well-founded glory, Avoid the overweening Tory. Whether they right or wrong have been Their party jars perplexed the Queen; Who still most equitably tried An honest course 'twixt either side. North and South Britain now become one land, And Union join each Scotch and English hand. Hail Caledonia! sister true, Long may thine Abercrombies, good as brave, Long may thy Duncans teach that foe to sue Who envious of Erin, us, and you, Dispute our triple right to rule the wave. France tries, without effect, the war to bring To Albion's guarded shores; the gallant Byng Sir George Byng. Puts the Pretender's fleet to rapid flight, And James the Third deserts his self-named right. Mourn'd, lov'd, esteem'd, the “royal Dane,” George, Prince of Denmark. Our sov'reign's consort, pays great nature's debt, The heaviest sorrow of a well-spent reign, Was Anne's keen, unaffected, deep regret. Now sateless war, with fire terrific, rages; And Guiscard, now, a Gallic wight, engages To snatch by dire assasination Great Harley's life; due execration Attends his well-prevented plan, And, victim of his treason, falls the man. Anxious that Discord's voice should cease, The Queen attends to proffei'd peace; Churchill dissents, and, strange to say, Stripp'd of his honours in a day, Th' unconquer'd, conquering foe of France; His country's glory, and her friend, Beholds adversity, with years advance, And, strangely doom'd to fade away With most unmerited neglect, By those deserted he could once protect, In imbecility awaits his end! Peace, sign'd at Utrecht, gives the nation rest, And peace we idlers always think is best; Anne's ministers, to their disgrace, With ill-bred warmth, before her face, Assail each other.—Pens of old Say, grief that parties shou'd prevail; 'Ere yet her years were fully told, Shorten'd her being, and, of course, my tale. Two sons, four daughters, prematurely died; And Brunswick's Line our hope and pride, (Long may it flourish good and great!) Succeeded to the vacant state. No reign than Anne's in war more justly crown'd, No reign for learning justly more renown'd; Elizabeth, a Shakespeare own'd: Charles could a Milton boast; But Anne saw Newton high enthroned, Amid the heavenly host! Anne, who with reason had been vain, Had Newton only graced her reign: But names like Burnett, Tilloston, With Atterbury, Clarendon, Swift, Addison, and Bolingbroke, With Boyle, might envy well provoke. And tho' succeeding monarchs knew Their worth, yet at this time they grew, Nurtured by freedom as by taste, While, no less vigorous than chaste, Each Muse finds ev'ry succeeding age Proud to admire and imitate her page!

HOUSE of BRUNSWICK. “Thrice happy are Britannia's bounded Kings, “What tho' not theirs the boast in dungeon glooms “To plunge bold freedom; to control the laws, “And make injurious will their only rule? “To clothe the naked, feed the hungry, wipe “The guiltless tear from lone affliction's eye, “Make a whole glorious people sing for joy, “Bless human-kind, and through the downward depth “Of future times to spread that better sun “Which lights up British souls.” Thomson. GEORGE THE FIRST. Such splendor as an isle like ours, In trust deputing sov'reign pow'rs; Cou'd give to grace a royal day, And welcome Brunswick's equal sway; Hail'd George's entrance to a land, Whose people met him heart and hand. 1714. The Whigs in Parliament prevail, And with impeachments arm assail Oxford and Bolingbroke, nor spare 1715. Ormond and Stafford;—next declare The Habeas Corpus Barrier suspended, On grounds of mischief to the state intended. More nobles are disgraced, and such Our fears, that succour from the Dutch Are ask'd in haste.—While James's son, (Who to his interest had won Mar, The Earl of Mar had been Secretary of State; had taken the oath to King George, and signed the proclamation, declaring him to be his lawful Sovereign; but, on some disgust, retired to the Highlands, where he was met by the Marquises of Huntley and Tullibardine, the Earls of Nithisdale, Mareschal, Traquair, Errol, Southesk, Carnwath, and Seaforth, who raised 6000 men, and proclaimed James VIII. Foster, and a list who stood In high degree of northern blood,) In Scotland lands with aid from France, Attended by a warlike train, With checquer'd fortune, who advance Mid wars alternate frown and smile, Which cheers or sinks them, 'till Argyle Sends baffled James to Paris back again. He had been proclaimed, called a council, fixed the day of his coronation, and assumed other acts of royalty. 1716. Prior to this, at Preston town, Victorious, George's colours fly; And Foster's chiefs their arms lay down, The Earls of Derwentwater, Widdrington, and Mr. Foster, proclaimed James Stuart at Morpeth, Hexham, &amp;c. and at length at Preston, where they were attacked by Generals Wills and Carpenter, to whom 1400 of them, including General Foster, Lords Derwentwater, Nithisdale, Wintoun, Carnwath, Widdrington, Kenmure, with 143 other Scotch Noblemen and Gentlemen, and 75 English Gentlemen, surrendered. Forster and some others afterwards escaped, particularly Lord Nithisdale. Many were executed and transported, but the major part received the benefit of an Act of Grace. Trusting to royal clemency. Yet 'ere the Prince, so styled, retired, His highlanders, by warm attachment fired, With target round and broad claymore, At Sheriffmuir November the 13th, the very day of the surrender at Preston, the right of the Duke of Argyle's army had routed the left of the Highlanders, when the right charged the Duke's left wing so furiously, that they came close to the muzzles of our soldier's musquets, and, warding off the bayonets with their targets, so used their broadswords that they made dreadful slaughter of the King's forces. wrought muckle pain, To lads who ne'er had seen the like before, Nor ever wish'd to see the like again! Septennial Parliaments this year, First sanctioned by the law appear. A lunatic attempt assails The safety of the Prince of Wales; But, to the joy of Britain, fails. At Drury-Lane Theatre, Freeman was the name of an unfortunate man whose pistol, supposed to be aimed at the Prince, wounded one of the Guards in the shoulder. The iron King of Sweden, vext Bremen and Verden had been bought Of Danes, who won them of him, thought (Furnish'd by this unsound pretext,) To work our island wondrous harm, And in King James's cause to arm; But all his menaces were vain, Measures so very prompt were ta'en: That he, thro' Orlean's mediation, Sought timely reconciliation. About a measure of supplies, Occasioned by His Majesty's asking money, to conclude alliances, without informing his parliament of the particulars. 'Twixt Parliament and King arise Dissensions warm; and these scarce done, When 'twixt the royal sire and son, Some unexplain'd domestic jar, The King appointed the Duke of Newcastle to stand Godfather with him to the Prince of Wales's infant son; which much displeased the Prince, who was ordered to leave St. James's, and retired to Leicester-House: thus there were two Courts, and the partizans of each were denied access to the other. His Majesty never afterwards, on visiting his foreign dominions, entrusted the Government to the Prince, but always left a Regency. The infant mentioned died soon after its baptism. Ends in a sort of party war. Germany, Britain, Holland form With France a Quadruple Alliance; 'Gainst which, regardless of a coming storm, Iberia hurls a bold defiance; 'Till Byng July 31st, near Messina, Sir George Byng signally and gloriously defeated the Spanish Fleet. by signal grand defeat, Nearly annihilates her Fleet. Another landing in the north is tried, Supported by the help of Spain; But soon is quell'd, and Spanish pride 1719. Is glad the Peace, late spurn'd at, to obtain. The South Sea Bubble now appears, 1720. Which caused some smiles, some countless tears: And set half Europe by the ears! Lord Macclesfield on accusation, Of most unseemly peculation; Tried by his Peers, and guilty found, Is fined in thirty thousand pound! I hope the Poetic Licence will excuse the insertion of pound for pounds. 1726. The Sweed, the hardy Russian and the Dane Own our ascendant o'er the subject main: Which Wager, Hosier, Jennings, still maintain. Gibraltar's siege promotes our martial pride, Yet Fortune seldom proves entirely kind; For, 'ere the year expired, great Newton died, Who, certes, hath not left his like behind. Next, Death, the awful visitant who spares Nor high nor low, released from regal cares 1727. And earthly pain, (the Muse is proud to sing), An honest minded man in England's King; A man who ne'er cou'd condescend To fear a foe, or leave a friend; Not only friends but enemies will own, That, like a King, he fill'd Britannia's throne. “The royal sire, to realms of bliss removed, “(Like the famed phœnix,) from his pyre shall spring “Successive Georges, gracious and beloved, “And good and glorious as the parent King.” Cunningham. GEORGE THE SECOND. Aonther Brunswick fills the regal chair, 1727. And vows to make Britannia's weal his care; His Majesty, in council, deelared he would maintain the religion, laws, and liberties of this realm; as also the alliances entered into by the late King; and his first speech from the throne evinced that his plan with regard to foreign affairs did not vary from that of his late royal sire. Gibraltar's siege, some hopes of peace with Spain, And change of Ministry commence this reign. Onslow is chosen Speaker, and maintain'd 1728. For three and thirty years the post he gain'd; Windham and Pultneys, figure in debate, Against imputed errors of the state; Yet Walpole's friends around their patron fly, And grant the King four millions of supply. Parma invites the monarch we disown, And yields him honours due to England's throne, Our sov'reign's brother, Ernest yields his breath, And German Protestants bewail his death; 1729. Our Sov'reign's son resigns his native land, And finds a home on Britain's willing strand. Oppressive Spain our indignation rouses, Which Parliament proclaims in both its houses; The civil list, a Bill prepared to meet Abuses in the prison of the Fleet, With other needed salutary laws, Obtain the Parliament deserved applause. And, ere the session makes its final close, The King abroad on special purpose goes: 1730. Some discord to compose, which chanced to spring 'Twixt Hanoverian States and Prussia's King. A Spanish peace, the salt tax set aside, Our Eastern merchants charter'd rights renew'd; Land tax redeem'd, and Acts meant to provide That pension'd members should no more intrude Were framed: but interested elves, no doubt, Contrived to kick the wholsome embrio out.1731. Now pamphlet scribblers, with determined rage, The war of party 'gainst each party wage; The Craftsman flourish'd under Pult'ney's eye, Nor Bolingbroke disdain'd its page supply. The Crafts man was a celebrated periodical paper, patronised by Mr. W. Pulteney, and often written for by Lord Bolingbroke. Law processes, which heretofore appear In Latin, take an English form this year; Vienna's treaty bids dissention cease, And Continental Europe rests in peace. 1732. A standing army next as it should seem, In either senate form'd a fruitful theme; Sutton and Grant for peculation base, Incur severe and well deserv'd disgrace; Sir Archibald Sutton and Sir Robert Grant were expelled for iniquitous proceedings in the affairs of the “Charitable Corporation;” a public company which lent money on pledges. Mr. Serjeant Birch, and Dennis Bond, Esq. were disgraced for fraud, in disposing of Lord Derwentwater's forfeited estate. While Birch and Bond the list of crime who swell'd, Were by the Commons, properly, expell'd. That famous measure ministers advise, 1733. Which met with long resistance,—the Excise; And Walpole, who the people's anger braved, By Cunningham was from their fury saved. Sir Robert, on his way to the House, was so much insulted, that had not Mr. Cunningham, a Scotch Member, drawn his sword and dispersed the leaders of the mob, the consequence might have been fatal. A change of State Directors now we find, 1734. And Chesterfield with other chiefs resign'd. Now sports and gay festivities began To grace the nuptials of our Princess Anne, The Prince of Orange and the wedded fair, Regretted, to Batavia repair. On this occasion, when every public occurrence formed the subject of a street ballad, the following elegant lines were sung through the metropolis:—“What's a rhyme for Porringer? “What's a rhyme for Porringer? “The King cou'd spare “A daughter fair, “And he gave the Prince of Orange her!” On closing Parliament, the royal speech Was form'd the best of theories to teach; Long may such doctrine grace Britannia's throne, And flourish not in theory alone: So shall we all proclaim with union's voice, “The throne we honor is the people's choice! On the 16th of April an end was put to the sessions by a most pathetic speech, in which are these remarkable words: “May there be no distinction but such as mean the support of our present happy Constitution in Church and State, and such as wish to subvert both: this is the only distinction that ought to prevail in this country, where the intetest of the king and people is one andthe same, and where they cannot subsist but by being so.”” “Some criminals now underwent “Inoculation, “Which happ'ly answer'd the intent “Of preservation! “And mothers thought it now their duty “To save their childrens lives and beauty.” Vide a comic poem called the last dying words of the 18th century; other authorities place the introduction of innoculation in 1721. The King appears, what office can be greater? In that 'twixt angry states of mediator; 1735. Russia and Denmark, both of trade and peace, Sign treaties with us—Yet we much increase Our naval force, as needful to maintain An equipoise of pow'r with France and Spain; The King his German states re-visits, while His consort mildly governs Britain's isle. This year, when Parliament had met, 1736. They overhaul'd the public debt; Which then was thought a great evil, amounting to the sum of £47,938,288...3s...3¾o.; the author does not know its amount now to so exact a calculation, but fears the evil is not much lessened. And talk'd of means by which to pay it, But, sorry is the Muse to say it, No one has hit upon a method yet. Yet rashly let us not conclude, But hope (of hoping I'm a sanguine lover,) To pay it off, as also to discover Decrease of taxes and the longitude. Fred'rick, of Wales, a foreign bride espouses, Closer uniting our's with German houses; April 27th, His Royal Highness Frederick Prince of Wales married Augusta, sister to the Duke of Saxe Gotha. In Edinburgh, we tell with pain, 1737. By lawless hands was Porteous slain; Porteous, Captain of the City Guard, having commanded his men to fire on the mob at a riot, occasioned by the execution of one Wilson, a smuggler, was himself dragged from prison, and hanged by the populace. And, proof of the caprice of fate, To men of high or low estate, Corsican Theodore descends From regal rank, and, canopied, 'tis said, By humble semi-tester of his bed, Theodore retained so much attachment to regal form and ceremony, that when the amount of a subscription for his support was presented to him, he received the donors with his hat on, while seated under the half-tester of a wretched bed, which served for a throne and canopy. His life, in London, most obscurely ends; Nor yet exempt from Death's unerring aim Are crowns more fortunate.—With spotless fame, By genuine grief attended to the tomb, Good Caroline partakes our common doom. “Now Covent Garden Playhouse rose, Last dying words of the eighteenth century. “To Lincoln's Inn an eye-sore! “Tho' no Processions then, nor Shows, “Nor Elephants from Mysore! “The building then gave much delight, “Tho' not intended all for sight! “For in these times, as writers say, “They went to hear not see a Play.” Disputes between our Court and Spain, 1738. Give cause for fearing war again; 'Till the two States, for strifes prevention, Patch up a much disliked convention. But Discontent, avaunt! this glorious year, In garb of gayest triumph shou'd appear; And Fortune's brightest smile shou'd grace the morn, When a Third George, our Parent King was born! Born for each virtue, piety wou'd preach, Or practice prove, or good example teach; Born for his people, dearly honor'd yet With their best love and most sincere regret. Oh! may it's source admit of quick relief, And prove, tho' poignant, not a cureless grief; A grief 'tis our's submissively to feel, And bless the hand which only wounds to heal! Of Spain dissatisfied once more we tell, On England's triumphs too the Muse might dwell, And sing how Vernon Admiral Vernon took Porto Bello with only six ships of the line. Admiral Haddock also took a Spanish Register ship, worth £120,000. fought, and Porto Bello fell; And more of gallant deeds wou'd she presume To tell, but that she's rather pinch'd for room. One stately dome for civic pomp and joy, And one to shield the orphan girl or boy, Who, early doom'd adversity to know, Finds shelter for “the houseless child of woe;” Majestic rise, and rising add new fame To London's beauty and each founder's name. Micajah Perry, Esq. the then Lord Mayor, laid the first stone of the Mansion House; and the Charter for instituting the Foundling Hospital was obtained by Captain Coram. Westminster and Blackfriars Bridges were also built in this reign. Now frost-bound Thames “a curious scene discloses, On it they roast an ox, and toast their noses. To Germany was Princess Mary carried, 1740. By Frederick, of Hesse: But, reader, you may guess The lady didn't go 'till she was married. Now war lights up a flame again, 'Twixt England, Holland, France, and Spain; Our enemies in angry mood averr'd, England should be invaded; England declared she wou'dn't; And, as I've heard, She kept her word, As for her foes, 'twas more than they did, Because—they cou'dn't!1741. Yet was the war in Parliament much blamed, And civil discord furiously flamed With ministerial rage, and no less hate From opposition in each stern debate. Sir Robert Walpole made a very remarkable speech in one of these debates, part of which ran thus:—“Gentlemen have talked a great deal of patriotism; a venerable word, sir, when duly practised. But I am sorry, sir, to say, that of late it has been so much hackneyed about, that it is in danger of falling into disgrace. The very idea of true patriotism is lost, and the term has been prostituted to the very worst of purposes. A patriot! sir! why patriots spring up like mushroons! I could raise fifty of them within the four-and-twenty hours. I have raised many of them, sir, in one night, it is but refusing to gratify an unreasonable or an insolent demand, and up starts a patriot. I have never been afraid of making patriots, sir, but I disdain and despise all they can do!” About this period Prussia's King began To prove the hero blended with the man; The mimic hero, Garrick, now came forth, And crowds applauding stamp'd his genuine worth. 1742. Walpole, whose pow'r and interest declines, Yields to opposing voices and resigns; Walpole, who not in politics o'er nice, Declared that “Ev'ry patriot had his price;” Exalted to the Peerage, He was, on his resignation, created Earl of Orford. makes his bow, Nor heeds the clamour left behind, (which now Calls for impeachment,) but with placid smile, Regards each threat of Pult'ney and Argyle. The Duke of Argyle was particularly hostile to the late Minister, and, on Mr. Pulteney's advising moderation, threw up all his employments, while the people exclaimed the nation was betrayed by screening the Earl of Orford. Our British boys, led on by gallant Stair, To scenes of Continental war repair; Cart'ret at home assumes the reins of pow'r, Not ill sustain'd by Bathurst and by Gower. But changes still distract the nation, 1743. Which loudly calls for new administration; And set afloat, as it should seem, What was yclep'd a grand broad-bottom'd scheme; Orford's impeachment, long expected, Again proposed, is once again rejected. The King concludes the sessions 'ere he goes 1743. To take the field in person 'gainst his foes; At Dettington, with William by his side, The British Monarch turns the battle's tide; The King and the Duke of Cumberland fought with the greatest bravery in posts of most imminent danger,—the latter received a wound in the leg. Compels the Gallic chief to sound retreat, Marshal Noailles likewise behaved well, but at length sounded a retreat, after loosing 6000 men and many officers;—the loss of the allies was 2,500 and 2 officers. While France laments her chosen son's defeat; And George, in council sage as brave in field, Sees Princes to his able guidance yield. 1744. Threaten'd invasion her red standard rears, And Roquefeuilles navy on the wave appears; Him Norris baffled,—many blame the knight, Who did not capture those he put to flight. Sir John Norris, whose superior force drove back the invading fleet, on board of which was the Pretender's son, was charged with want of spirit in not effecting more. Matthews and Lestock with Old Rowley join'd, Attack the French and Spanish fleets combined; Hard was the contest, till receding day Fled, with our batter'd enemies, away. There Hawke fought bravely, gallant Cornwall fell, And more was done than we have space to tell. On the 11th of February the combined French and Spanish Fleets resolved to fight their way from Toulon, where they were blocked up by Admiral Mathews. Our fleet was vastly inferior as to number, and the enemy escaped under cover of the night, with the loss of one ship of the line, and 1000 men killed; our killed and wounded amounted to 400—An enquiry was afterwards made into the conduct of our admirals, for letting the enemy escape so well, Mathews and some captains were broke, Lestock and the rest honourably acquitted. Anson, whose ships begirt the globe, we view Returning with the treasures of Peru; The world pays tribute to his mental power, And Paita's plunder decks proud London's Tower; With change of men in pow'r the year we close, And now the Pelham Ministry arose. No pleasure were it here to trace 1745. Rebellion's progress and disgrace, Else might we in right mournful verse, The deeds of men misled rehearse; And tell how, in the Western Isles, His followers Prince Charles beguiles; And from their due allegiance draws The brave adherents to a cause Which ruin pluck'd on many a Clan, Whose crime in honesty began. Who taking warmth of heart for reason, From loyalty engendered treason; Nor do we to pourtray delight The horrors of Culloden fight, Where victory in blood-stain'd vest, For ever set the theme to rest. The Young Pretender landed in one of the Western Isles, on the 14th of July, and great numbers flocked to his standard,—he soon proclaimed his father at Perth, and got possession of Edinburgh; defeated Sir John Cope, and obtained a complete victory at Preston Panns, where the celebrated colonel Gardener was killed by the scythe of a Highlander; the Young Pretender then proceeded as far as Manchester, where the preparations made to oppose him, and the march of the Duke of Cumberland, occasioned a retreat of the rebel army, which the Duke finally overtook, and entirely subdued on the Plain of Culloden, April the 16th, the soi disant prince with difficulty escaped to France, and left many of his partizans to pay dearly for their attachment to his supposed rights. Again, the state wheel turns about, 1746. Some Outs come in, and Ins go out. Our navy, shall I credence gain? Has loss of honor to sustain; In the East Indies, Commodore Peyton declined engaging the French Admiral de la Bourdonnais, who took Madras; the Spaniards carried their treasures safe to Old Spain;—and Commodore Mitchell, who was ordered to intercept a French fleet, from Martinico, suffered it to escape, for which he was tried and broke— An armament against Quebec, under Admiral Lestock and Gener I Sinclair, sailed too late to effect its purpose, and being then sent to surprise port L'Orient failed also in that attempt. But in the next succeeding year, Anson and Warren on the sea, Admirals Anson and Warren were victorious over the French fleet, on the 3d of May, taking many ships of the line;— 46 merchantmen richly laden were captured in June; Admiral Hawke took 6 ships of the line in October. And Hawke, a name to seamen dear, As was on land brave Ligonier, The bravery and conduct of Sir John Ligonier at the battle of Val, saved the allied army, altho' himself was taken prisoner while endeavouring to preserve the Duke of Cumberland. Reclaim'd the palm of victory; Nor did our better fortune cease, 'Till, best of all, came smiling Peace. 1748. Peace reigns abroad, at home less quiet, We are disgraced by party riot; 1749. Which Oxford, Litchfield, Bristol too, Require coercion to subdue. Now first in embrio was known A Colony, since finely grown; New Scotland they the infant styled, Now a prodigious thriving child; Two earthquakes and disease as fell, 1750, As many a monument may tell, Alarm'd the land; and, sad to say, 'Twas fates decree to snatch away The royal Fred'rick, England's heir, His royal highness died on the 20th of March, 1751. 1751. Hence George became the nation's future care. Portugal, Sweden, Holland, Denmark, all Are likewise doom'd to see a sov'reign fall; Two Kings, two Princes, and a Queen appear To swell Death's harvest in one little year; The Kings of Portugal and Sweden, the Princes of Wales and Orange, and the Queen of Denmark, daughter of George II. 1752. Nor less his triumph, Bolingbroke, when you Discharge the debt from earth to nature due! To Sloane a monument of praise, 1753. Britain's Museum now they raise; Pelham his place and life resigns, 1754. Clive, 'er'st unheard of in the nation, Saves India, brightest star that shines, In our commercial constellation; While Europe's peace, of short duration, Begins to tremble at ambitious France; 1755. And War's destructive imps with savage stride advance. A dreadful elemental agitation, Shook Lisbon through it's whole foundation; In undistinguish'd ruin all Her palaces, her temples fall: Her nobles, mingled with their native clay, In undistinguish'd heaps by peasants lay. From us each sad survivor aid receives, While Britain sympathises and relieves! Her noble sympathies have long convey'd 1756. Most sterling comfort to who want her aid. For which, that Power who nations weighs above, 'Tis our's to hope, will Britain ever love. Joy of our isle, and terror of it's foes, Pride of the good, illustrious Chatham rose; Fox too, with Pitt, coeval, glorious name, Surrounded each by well-earn'd deathless fame! Ah, how shall trivial numbers sing 1757. The fall of hapless gallant Byng; Presuming pen! most sure to fail, Diaw, as the painter did, a veil O'er manly grief's expressive face, Nor versify the land's disgrace! War riots through the burning earth, And gives to crime and glory birth; In varied fall or elevation, Sports with each fierce contending nation. Blest Britain! may thy safe retreat Ne'er be of fiend-like war the seat; But gratitude to Heaven procure, The good thou hast may long endure. Contention's desolating hand, To Europe unconfined, Riots in India's distant land, Where tyrant Tippoo, base, and blind To honour, gives to most inhuman death; Britannia's warriors, whose struggling breath, From fell Calcutta's fiend-like dungeon flies For retribution, to avenging skies. A splendid list of names heroic blends 1758. With sea and land achievements, each day sends Advice of gallant deeds by William's arm. The Duke of Cumberland distinguished himself in every battle he was present at on the Continent. At sea, Admiral Boscawen defeated M. de la Clue, and took or burned four large ships of the line; he also took Louisburgh. General Amherst took Ticonderago, Crown Point, and Montreal. Admiral Hawke gloriously vanquished the French fleet in Quiberon Bay. Sir William Johnson took Nigara; Martinico, Guadaloupe, and Maregalante, were also taken. Lord Howe was killed gallantly fighting near Ticonderago, and succeeded by an Abercrombie. Monckton and Townsend signalized themselves with the immortal Wolfe. In Africa, Senegal was taken by Commodore Marsh, under the direction of Mr. Cumming, a Quaker. Boscawen, Amherst, Johnson, with an host, Who kept our enemies in dread alarm; Howe; Abercrombie; Monckton; Wolfe, who died Of Albion's sons the dearest pride, Of Albion's chieftains the most honored boast. Nor from the battle springs our fame alone, Where in it's cause the valiant soldier bleeds; Benevolence, as if she wou'd atone For Discord's brutal deeds, Founds an asylum for the orphan maid; A home where innocence, by man betray'd, Might find the narrow path whence late she stray'd. What if we travel, reader, from this road Of cramp chronology, and hear a tale, A true one too, of how this kind abode First rose the help and comfort of the frail. This freak of my erratic muse, I'm sure, your goodness will excuse; Forgive the manner, since the matter's true, For 'tis a fact, denied by few, Magna est Veritas, and will prevail! The Institution of the Magdalen. The Rev. Dr. Dingley assisted by Henry Fielding, Esq. and the celebrated, tho' unfortunate, Dr. Dodd, were among the first whose warm-hearted ideas gave birth to this valuable institution. I 'Twas darkest December, the frost pointed sleet Was borne on the whirlwind, like ocean's white foam; Fast closed was each door and deserted each street. Save of wretches who wander, devoid of a home: II 'Twas the season of joy, when his mem'ry sublime, Who bled for our sins and expired for our sake, Is hail'd with rude mirth, ill beseeming that time Which shou'd gratitude's noblest emotions awake. III The song, and the jest, and the story, went round, By warm hearths where the grape gaily circled about; And while on the ear burst loud merriments sound, Mirth heard from within, heighten'd mis'ry without. IV Where the portal superb of an opulent lord, With massy projection invaded the street; To share the cold shelter it's root might afford, Two children of want took a sorrowful seat. V 'Twas winter, I've said, yet thin garments of white The limbs of two shivering females enfold; And keenly past thro' them the blast of the night, As close to each other they shrank from the cold. VI The transit of heat those fell liquids impart, Those liquids impregnate with murderous fire, Had ceas'd to inflame, and left colder each heart, For that warmth of the instant which glows to expire. VII With voice scarcely human, so mournfully hoarse, Indignant in tone, yet suppressing a sigh, One daughter of error address'd her discourse, To the other who scarce rais'd her tear-swollen eye. VIII “That my parents are living you've oft heard me say, “And, I hoped, uninform'd of their Emily's fate; “They've discover'd me now, and a letter to day “Offers pardon and home,—but the offer's too late.” IX “Ah take it, accept it,” with eagerness cried The withering blossom, who lean'd on her knee: “Accept it! Oh, never!” indignant replied Stern Emily,—once no one milder than she. X “Accept it! encounter a mother's reproof, “A sister's contempt, a whole neighbourhood's scorn; “No! never again will I darken that roof, “Where wou'd I had never, ah never been born! XI “My father so partial, so fond, none beside, “Of his children so lov'd, so distingnish'd as I, “He liv'd but for me and for me wou'd have died, “And, sooner than meet him shall Emily die. XII “My brother, whose anger inflaming a mind “Once mild as an infant's, with vengeance too just, “Like lightning, flew swift my seducer to find, “And mingle his treacherous blood with the dust. XIII “Will he too forgive, or will he too forget “That for my sake he wielded the murderous steel? “No, his bosom must heave with those agonies yet, “His friend's breathless body first taught him to feel. XIV “Accurs'd be the tongue, tho' now silent in death, “Whose accents delusive my senses beguil'd; “Enveloping poison in flattery's breath, “To steal from her parents, their once happy child. XV ‘But mem'ry avaunt! why recur to the past? “Come, come, fellow suff'rer, this coin is yet mine; “Shall souls form'd like our's turn coward at last? “At yon tavern we'll drown the reflection in wine.” XVI Away, like a maniac, the frail one has fled, As with counterfeit glee a gay ditty she sung; Her companion remain'd, while faint, weary, half dead, From lips deadly-pale were these sentences wrung. XVII “Had I but a parent! had I but a home, “A sister, a brother, ah had I a friend! “No more in the streets wou'd I comfortless roam, “No more my long suffering conscience offend. XVIII “Might Industry succour the orphan bereft, “How hard wou'd I work for a morsel of bread; “But where shall the female by character left, “Find shelter to hide her disconsolate head? XIX “For who will the voice of her agony hear? “Or who with relief will her misery bless? “Or who will believe that the tale is sincere “Which tells of repentance enforced by distress?” XX By sobs interrupted, her accents grew weak, And many a tear fell congeal'd by the frost, As her sorrow-worn arm scarce supported her cheek, Yet neither those tears, nor those accents were lost. XXI A being, Benevolence beam'd in his heart, And the stamp of that feeling his countenance bore, Overheard her sad plainings unmingled with art, And vow'd to conduct her to virtue once more. XXII Nor did he alone to her sorrows extend The hand of assistance which led her to peace: He became of all penitent suff'rers the friend, And created a home where their sorrows might cease. XXIII The mansion exists, to his ne'er dying fame Which this appellation his memory gives: “The Friend of wrong'd Woman,” great, gorious name! It shall ne'er be extinct, while humanity lives! Our present sire attains his age, 1759. Meantime his aunt and sister quit Life's stage; One too we lost, whose potent spell, Like Orpheus' lyre had moved all hell; But Handel must not be profaned By tales which Bards have only feign'd: The minstrel's lot, we trust, is cast Where “his majestic strain can only be surpast.” Granby, and many British warriors more, 1760. This year may add to heroes named before; When lo! a sudden mist obscures the sky, Checks the successful stream of victory: And thousands with sincerity deplore That George, their king and father, is no more. October 25th, at Kensington, His Majesty had risen early, and anxious for news from Germany, he threw up a window sash to observe the wind, which exertion probably broke a blood vessel; for, very soon after, he fell exclaiming, “Call Amelia!” but was dead before the Princess reached the apartment. He was a soldier, a politician, and the father of his people—a warm temper his only foible; impartial in justice, he administered it with mercy; sincere and open, he disdained deceit, and was never known to break his word. The liberties of Europe, and the constitution of England, were constantly upheld by his wise and resolute conduct; and he died in the fulness of his glory. —Vide Lockman, &amp;c. Another Author says, “His public character was marked with a predilection for his native country, to which he sacrificed all other motives. If an error, certainly not a very unnatural one” Luffman's Elements of History and Chronology. When great men die who, living, claim respect From greatness only, on the 'scutchen'd hearse, In awful grandeur waves each sable plume, And pomp supplies the place of real regret. But when the man of worth exchanges life For better scenes, 'tis not the passing bell, Nor splendid orgies our attention claim, But ev'ry thought to one emotion yields, And unavailing anguish reigns supreme! This Britain felt, and own'd the mournful truth, When lost her father, magistrate, and friend, And doubly, trebly, felt the sacred bond Of gratitude, for public blessings dealt From the late much loved source of private virtue. “God save great George our King, “God save the King!” Carey. “That King whose cares a people's wants compose, “Who aids their joys, and sorrows in their woes; “Who, deaf to prejudice when vesting power, “Bestows promotion but as virtue's dower; “Who menial parasites expels the throne, “And deems all public freedom's foes his own.” “Investigation,” a Poem by C. Dibdin, Jun. “With length of days and glory crown'd, “With wealth and fair encrease; “Let him abroad be far renown'd, “And blest at home with peace.” Hughes. “Count still my Muse! (to count what Muse can cease,) “The works of public spirit, freedom, peace; “By them shall plants in forests reach the skies, “Then lose their leafy pride, and navies rise; “(Navies! which to invasive foes explain, “Heaven throws not round us rocks and seas in vain;) “The sail of commerce in each sky aspires, “And property assures what toil acquires. “Him the same laws the same protection yield, “Who plows the furrow, as who owns the field.” Savage. “Benign and gracious George, whose every deed “Throughout his holy life was amiable, “Dispensing blessings ever o'er his realms; “Under th' Almighty's visitation lies, “Fast bound! close lock'd! “Most merciful, just God! “As thou still sendest kindly, genial warmth “The bands of winter in due time to loose, “So may it please thee to restore “To reason, health, and happiness, our King!” Waldron's Literary Museum. GEORGE THE THIRD. Since Time who subjects empires to decay, And mingles palaces with cottage clay; Since Time destroy'd the gloomy bigots trade, And brought Nassau and Brunswick to our aid, No day more big with glorious hope we own, Than that which seated George on Britain's throne. With conquest flush'd, tho' tired of war (For war lays taxes,) was the nation; Yet naval vict'ries, near and far, Brought to our pride some consolation; For pride, aspiring like a rocket, Too oft soars high above the pocket. Onslow, who long had fill'd St. Stephen's chair, Retires, of years and honors plenum; So firm, yet mild, his office did he bear, That, in debate, no wranglers dare Proceed if once he stepp'd between 'em. In wedlock, hard (you'll own) the fate of Kings, Debarr'd the meanest subject's right,—free choice; Forced to accept what state convenience brings, And haply mourn while all around rejoice! Not so our George, bless'd by the pow'rs above With a free, brave, and gen'rous people's love, To yield him happiness without alloy, 1761. Kind fortune, for the monarch's joy, Brings Charlotte in propitious hour, To sooth the toils of state and power: Brings Charlotte, drest in Hymen's softest smiles, To bless the ruler of the British isles; To share that happy sovereign's throne Who found the nation's choice his own. Ah, think how many years have proved How worthy him the bride he loved; Ah, think how many years have flown, While Time's true test bids envy own Charlotte as Queen, as Mother, Friend and Wife, The pride of public, as of private, life! France seem'd just now for peace disposed, But Chatham's scrutinizing mind A compact en famille disclosed, By which the French, with Spain combined, Their blended interest to our's opposed, Pitt said to Britain “Don't be fool'd,” Pitt's council sage was overrul'd, And he resign'd. The French, after making overtures for peace, depending on the private support of Spain, insisted on inadmissable terms; and a treaty, called the Family compact, being entered into between France and Spain, Mr. Pitt proposed hostilities against the latter, which advice being rejected, he, with Lord Temple, resigned. This year, to tell it's worth our while, Keppel and Hodgson took Belleisle; While indefatigable Clive, Kept Indian interest quite alive. The Commons well convinced they must 1762. A Speaker chuse, chose Sir John Cust! And, reader, the next thing they do, Proved all that Pitt foreboded true; For war with Spain, to trade's derangement, Succeeds the “Family arrangement.” Pocock and Albermarle Admiral Sir George Pococke, and General the Earl of Albermarle, took the Capital of the Isle of Cuba from the Spaniards; nine Spanish ships of the line, spices and merchandise to the amount of more than three millions sterling, were the produce of this victory. now raise Our honor far beyond my praise; Nor dare I waste my ink and paper With strains unworthy gallant Draper; Who, join'd with all victorious Cornish, Admiral Cornish and General Draper took Manilla, the Capital of the Phillippine Islands; and two British frigates took the Hermione, a Spanish register ship worth a million sterling. Made Spanish leaders look forlornish. Next to compleat our exultation, In Charlotte's first-born England sees The hope of a delighted nation; A Prince now fortuned to sustain, With much of care and little ease, The pressure of a troublous reign, In times when he who all can please (While war and taxes thus exhaust us,) Must be “the Devil or Doctor Faustus!” “A curious thing these annals boast, “No less than a disturbed ghost, “Which visited Cock-Lane; “The neighbourhood around were shock'd, “For oh, at night, it scratch'd and knock'd, “And knock'd and scratch'd again!” Last Dying Words of the Eighteenth Century. In seventeen hundred, sixty three, 1763. The belligerents all agree: And, peace once signed between those elves, We 'gin to quarrel—with ourselves; Great discontents are kept alive By “Wilkes! and Number Forty Five!” Long Wilkes disputes the hand of pow'r, Which gives him lodgings in the Tower; Fights, travels, writes, and treats the nation, No doubt, with great illumination. The people's right he much befriended, And for that cause, He gain'd—much trouble, some applause, And there the matter ended. The ingenious Mr.Luffman, in his Elements of History and Chronology, observes, “Before we part with Mr. Wilkes, it must be allowed, that whether he acted from principle or resentment, he was a means of strengthening the just liberties of the people, by the noble stand he made against General Warrants, a remnant of the Star Chamber of Charles the First, and for which the British nation ought ever to be grateful.” It is, however, to be observed, that the patriotism of this gentleman terminated in (or was rewarded by) a place for life. So we behold in modern day, The people's champions, foes to power, Who write, and fight, and court the Tower; While Johnny Bull, their pains to pay, Gives 'em a popular huzza, And thinks of something else in half an hour. A second time the Queen, to England's joy, Presents her royal consort with a boy; Frederick, may thou and the succeeding line Of Brunswick long the royal stem entwine: While that, unbending as it's nation's oak, Shall scorn the pressure of a foreign yoke. Our Eastern commerce which we've seen to thrive, 1764. Under the guidance of unequall'd Clive, From Cossim Ally Cawn a check receives, Which Clive's good arm and genius soon retrieves; And Cossim mourns the British blood he shed, When turban'd chiefs, by basest treach'ry led, The halls of Patna with foul murder stain'd, And lost their honor, ne'er to be regain'd. Cossim took up arms against the English, and, having taken several prisoners at Patna, he caused forty officers and gentlemen of the East India Company, besides others of inferior rank, to be massacred; but in the end he was defeated. The sov'reign's sister gives her royal hand To Brunswick's Duke:—to his paternal land He bears the fair, and from this union springs The hope, perspective, of a race of Kings. Churchill and Hogarth, much we grieve to say, The awful debt of nature pay; Even genius, oft to poverty a brother, Pays that when haply he can pay no other. 1765. The stamp act proves the germ of ills to come, Which force Columbia to defend her home; Into a foe translated many a friend, And in American enlargement end. Changes are made, in hopes to serve the nation, And lo! a Rockingham administration To take the helm of government began, And bought of Athol's Duke the Isle of Man. From George and Charlotte's union springing, A third son sets the bells a ringing; And William Henry glads the royal pair, Whose union proves as fortunate as rare. Events most opposite succeed each other, Rejoicing in a son the sovereign mourns a brother, Prince Frederick William died this year, as did al o the Chevalier de St. George, commonly styled the Old Pretender; the Dauphin of France, and the Emperor of Germany. And to the ruthless tyrant death, The Old Pretender yields his breath. The men of Boston with such force oppose 1766. The Stamp Act that repeal takes place; The Ministers resign, and now arose The Grafton Government:—to aid his grace, Camden and Charley Townshend came, And Chatham, high in honorable fame. Our merchants, vastly fond of exportation, The want of other states to aid, Sent so much corn from out the nation That we were almost famish'd by the trade; And folks who didn't chuse to starve in quiet, (One don't know how to blame them,) made a riot. Merchants! 'ere thus again for pelf ye roam, “Remember, charity begins at home.” Michaelmas-day a Princess Royal gave us, Now Queen of Wirtemberg; so made By one to whom King-making is a trade, From which, on England's shore, kind fortune save us! King George's sister, Caroline, is seen The bride of Christian and Denmark's Queen. In India, war with savage fury roars, 'Till Clive again goes out and peace restores; Sujah Dowlah espoused the cause of Cossim, the deposed Nabob of Bengal; and such was the neglect of the Government there, that notwithstanding the victories of General Carnac, it was thought necessary to send out Lord Clive, who, upon his arrival, restored the peace of the country, by a treaty of alliance with the Mogul Emperor. At Monaco's Italian state, Edward of York submits to fate. His Majesty's brother, the Duke of York, died of a fever, at the Palace of the Prince of Monaco. A fourth son to the King is sent, 1767. Edward, since 'titled Duke of Kent; Paoli seeks asylum on our shore; The Jesuits' Order falls to rise no more; And, (what strange medley of historic lore!) The Irish Pailiaments, which erst extended, 'Till each incipient reign was ended, Are now decreed octennial and no more. King George resumes King William's grant of lands 1768. To Portland's Duke:—this case relief demands, And a Bill pass'd, for common weal, This old law maxim to repeal, (Law latin always puts me in a worrit,) Nullum tempus Regi occurrit; Which means, in spite of time, the throne May legally reclaim it's own. Now weavers riot about silks, And, ecce iterum! Mr. Wilkes Committed is in Banco Regis, (More latin!) which the mob besieges; And Allen, guiltless of the strife, To party fury yields his life. The monument of young Allen in Newington church-yard, which is also a monument of party spirit, relates the tragie end of this young man, who was followed into a cow-house by one of the guards and shot, during a riot for Wilkes in St. George's Fields. In London Pleasure takes the rein, To welcome here the royal Dane; Nor less to greet with heart-felt mirth, The day that gave Augusta birth. The Princess Augusta Sophia was born November the 8th. Again we're plunged in strange convulsion, 1769. By Wilkes' election and expulsion; Chatham and Shelburne's resignation, Make room for North's administration. The Eastern native chieftains rally Against our pow'r round Hyder Ally; When, sad to tell, Vansittart, Scrafton, Ford, Who to our aid in India meant to sail, Encounter on the seas so dread a gale, That down the vessel sank with ev'ry soul on board. American disputes encrease, And far remove all hope of peace; At home the Commons meet, and chuse Sir Fletcher Norton Speaker; who, As History informs the Muse, Gave them no cause their choice to rue. Another Princess blest the royal pair, In whose delight their people truly share; Eliza, thy oft prov'd domestic worth, Credits the public joy which graced thy birth. Our docks at Plymouth set on fire, Proclaim how hot our foemen's ire; And a hush'd up fracas with Spain, Gives ground to look for war again. The cause of Wilkes, with fresh commotion, Makes London like a troubled ocean; One side against the other pitted, A Mayor and Alderman committed; Brass Crosby and Alderman Oliver, were committed to the Tower. Which party heats cause great regret, Evils not much diminish'd yet. The Queen again presents her lord a Prince, 1771. Ernest, the King's fifth son, and since Created Duke of Cumberland;—to say The Muse laments the death of Gray, Were all superfluous—when genius dies Death proves the bitterest of enemies! The Commons well their rights defended 1772. Against the Upper House, they scout All money bills by Lords amended, And, practically, kick 'em out. The Common: asserted their exclusive privilege of having, all Money Bills either rejected, or passed without amendment by the other House; two Money Bills, returned by the Lords with amendments, were flung over the table by the Speaker, and kick'd out of the House by the Merabers. Our roy l parent's mother finds that bourne From whence, 'tis truly said, there's no return; Augustus, to our list of Princes adding, 1773. Sets all our loyal lads and lasses madding. America again essays to gain Her freedom, nor, at length, essays in vain; 1775. Congress assembles first, we're bid remember Upon the fifth (of all days,) in November, Adolphus Fred'rick to the royal tree Adds a new branch; Furneaux, in happy time, Returns from compassing the world by sea, And brings Omiah from his native clime. Much of debate, hot rancour, and ill will, Precedes a war from which there's no retreating; America maintains the contest still, With various issues:—but at Bunker's Hill, From British bands Columbia gets a beating. Now Washington, true patriot! arose, Shield of his country, terror of his foes; Second Cincinnatus, yet greater far, The first with savage nations urg'd the war. But Washington, a rude untutor'd host Against the chosen sons of Britain led; Against a band, their country's pride and boast, With names like Howe and Clinton at their head. No farther here the struggle let us trace, Enough to say, by Washington defended, Columbia gain'd her point, and with good grace We own'd her free, and thus the contest ended. It was not till the year 1783 that Great Britain, at the general pacification, acknowledged the independence of America. 'Twas then the patriot warrior began Prove how the hero rose above the man; No regal recompence, no iron crown, No wrested rule bedecks his brow or hand, Proud to resign as to assume command; Chief of the Free, with freedom he lays down A sacred trust confided by the land. This is true greatness!! In his hall of state What conqueror, tho' lord of half the earth Inspires that awe, to which the cottage gate Of Washington for ages must give birth? Oh, Guerdon rich! what royalty above, The glorious empire of a People's Love!! What else cou'd George's sceptre have sustain'd, Through times, as “out of joint,” as Hist'ry knows? Yet midst this “age of reason,” George has gain'd, Respect, not e'en witheld him from his foes. This strife of brothers caused the war again 1776, To rage between Britannia, France, and Spain; With joy we next announce, the theme to vary, The Birth propitious of our Princess Mary; And tho' our verse may ill the task assume, Yet History must weep the death of Hume. The record next to infamy we turn, 1777. Behold where Britain's naval treasures burn; Portsmouth! the billows which thy harbours lave Reflect fell fires in ev'ry curling wave. Aitken, like him who fired th' Ephesian fane, In felon reputation will remain; Nay! the Muse fears of treason you'll attaint her, That rogue for only naming—John the Painter. Sophia, newly-born, with infant voice, Bids England's father and his sons rejoice. Amidst the heat of senatorial strife, 1778. Chatham appears with fast retiring breath, And where his country claim'd his well spent life, Makes a last effort for her cause in death. Now Cockneys, as they gravely walk, In consequential tones, Of Coxheath Camp and Keppel talk, And wonder at Paul Jones. “Ye chiefs of the ocean your laurels throw by, “Or the cypress entwine with each wreath, “At the shrine of humanity heave a soft sigh, “And a tear now let fall for his death: “Yet the genius of Britain forbids us to grieve, “Since Cooke ever honoured, immortal shall live.” So sang a Bard, when Cooke's regretted blood Ting'd on Owyhee's fatal shore the flood; Unrival'd chief! who found a cruel grave From those his generous feelings sought to save! To former joys of royal sire and mother Octavius is born to add another. And now reluctantly we tell 1780. What the Metropolis befel, From lawless villains who defame, To grace their guilt, religion's name: “No Popery,” the fact ous cry That led to deeds of blackest dye; “No Popery” the signal dire To light up Discord's fiercest fire; And London sees, in pale amaze, Her palaces and temples blaze; Her magistrates stand idly by, While conflagration braves the sky. 'Till rous'd from her lethargic trance, See retribution now advance; Then caution, 'camp'd beneath our walls, At length the rabble rout appals; And Gordon nearly pays with life, The forfeit of the lawless strife Which, with most inconsiderate head, And frantic zeal of late he led. These riots, the worst that ever disgraced a civilized nation, lasted from the 30th of May till the 8th of June, during which time the rioters were absolute masters of the metropolis and its environs; many chapels and houses were demolished, and their contents committed to the flames; Newgate, the King's Bench, and the Fleet Prisons, were set on fire, and the prisoners liberated. The Bank was twice attacked, but without effect; and 36 fires were visible at one time, from an eminence near Hampstead. The numbers killed and wounded in the streets and on Blackfriars bridge, amounted to six hundred, independent of many whose wounds were privately attended, from their not wishing to have it known they had been concerned in the tumult. Several of the principal rioters were hanged at, or near the places where outrages were committed. Lord George was committed to the Tower for high treason, at first a close prisoner, but, after some time had clapsed, he had more indulgence, and was eventually acquitted on his trial. Mark, the Dutch admiral Byland yielding, To fearless British captain Fielding; Behold, where Parker's genius rises, To fill our ports with gallant prizes; And, the proud record to compleat, See Rodney master of Langara's fleet; Digby and Geary swell our victories, And Rodney's flag again triumphant flies. The Dutch Admiral, Count Byland, struck his flag to Captain Fielding, rather than submit to a question of search;—Rear Admiral Parker sent home a vast number of French and Spanish prizes;—Admiral Sir George Rodney, after taking a Spanish 64, with her convoy of 22 merchant ships, gained a complete victory over the squadron commanded by Don Juan De Langara, five sail of the line were taken, and one blew up;—Rear Admiral Digby took a French 64;—Admiral Rowley captured two large French frigates; and Admiral Parker took a convoy of nine sail, from Martinico;—the Salisbury took a Spanish 50 gun ship;—Rodney defeated Admiral De Guichen;—Admiral Geary took eleven sail of merchant vessels; and Captain Edward Moore, of the Fame privateer of Dublin, with his single ship took 4 French Letters of Marque. Alfred the royal stock encreases; Cornwall succeeds as Mister Speaker; All hope of peace grows daily weaker, And for a time entirely ceases. While on our victories we dwell, T'is our's impartially to tell, That fifty-five as gallant ships As ever took commercial trips, Happ'ning by sad mischance to meet The Gallico-Iberian fleet, Became, oh, sorrow and surprize! Captive to England's enemies. A large outward-bound West India fleet and five East Indiamen, in all about 55 ships, unfortunately fell into the midst of the combined fleets of France and Spain, in the bay of Gadiz, in the night between the 8th and 9th of August, and were almost all taken. War with the Dutch adds to our troubles, 1781. And trade's embarrassment redoubles. If I mistake, 'tis your's to judge it, But only overhaul the Budget Which, for the service of the year, Will millions, twenty-three appear; Thousands, seven hundred fifty-six, And hundreds, (as accountants fix,) Some one or two;—a sum so great Had ne'er before disturb'd the state; But “damned custom” hath, as now one sees, “Made it” to us “a property of ease.” The French take Jersey, 'ere the dawn of light, Only to quit it with returning night. Ne'er shall the genuine, grateful tear, Cease to embalm brave Pierson's bier; The gallant Major Pierson, with the assistance of Captains Aylward and Mulcaster, and the militia of the island, re-took the town of St. Hellear, which had capitulated (under Governor Corbett,) to the French General; who, as well as Major Pierson, was slain in the re-capture. Who found among the patriots brave, A soldier's honor'd, glorious, grave. Success still hovers o'er the navy, And (all the pains we can to save ye), We very willingly excuse, Too close attendance on the Muse, Who means her duty to discharge in Enumeration, “as per margin. Rodney, in conjunction with General Vaughan, took the important Dutch settlement of St. Eustatia, with the islands of St. Martin and Saba; a Dutch frigate, 5 sloops of war, and 150 sail of merchantmen;—a Dutch 60 gun ship, and 30 sail of merchantmen were taken by Captain Reynolds.—Rodney afterwards took Demerara, Issiquebo, and St. Bartholomew;—Admiral Darby relieved Gibraltar;—Admiral Parker defeated the Dutch, under Zoutman, in a great battle off the Dogger Bank;—and Admiral Kempenfelt beat a French squadron, from which he took 19 sail of transports and merchantmen laden with ordnance and naval stores.” Per contra, we must now relate, Nor Arbuthnot, ('tis battles fate,) Nor Graves, nor Hotham, each as brave As any he that stems the wave, Had such good fortune in their fighting, As those of whom we've just been writing. Vice Admiral Arbuthnot engaged the French fleet under Monsieur de Ternay, off Virginia, the action was indecisive, and the British squadron much damaged—Commodore Hotham, while convoying the St. Eustatia fleet, was intercepted by M. la Motte Piquet, with seven sail of the line, who captured twenty-one of the merchantmen; and the British fleet under Admiral Graves had an unsuccessful engagement with the French (commanded by M. Du Barras) in the Bay of Chesapeake. Mars too, in India, made a sally, Under the flag of Hyder Ally; Who, join'd by Fortune, murrain fetch her! Defeated Baillie and bold Fletcher. Hyder Ally invaded the province of Arcot, surprised a detachment of British who were marching to its relief, under Colonels Baillie and Fletcher, killed and took 508 of the British including a great number of officers, and 3300 of the native troops in our service. In seventeen hundred eighty-two, 1782. The Parliament found much to do; Each party t'other undermining, Which ended in Lord North's resigning: Him scarcely Rockingham in pow'r replaced, With “royal honors guarded round and graced,” When Death, who sometimes sides with opposition, Made room for a new state physician. FOX now resigns; and, lo! where sit In council, Shelburnf, Townshend, Pitt; The former ministry began The work of reconciliation, The latter well pursued the plan, And met successful termination. The curse of human slaughter 'gins to cease, 1783. Old England and America shake hands; All Continental Europe bows to peace, While commerce promises encrease, Where war late drain'd so many luckless lands. Rodney, to gild the wars conclusion, (Hear critic to thy great confusion, We cannot let a poor pun pass,) Made the foe once more cry peccavi, And to the dashing Gallic navy Gave, as it were, a Coup De Grasse. On the memorable 12th of August, Rodney beat Degrasse, and took him in the Ville de Paris, with 3 other line of battle ships and sank one.—Seven days afterwards, Sir Samuel Hood took two more ships of the line, in which glorious action Captain Blair of the Anson, and Lord Robert Manners who commanded the Resolution, were killed.—About the same time Admiral Barrington took the Pegase of 74 guns, the Actionnaire of 64, and 10 sail of transports. Admiral Howe relieved Gibraltar which Elliot had most nobly defended, and the Spanish batteries were destroyed by the brave Sir Roger Curtis. Whate'er of such a joke the sin, I still say “let those laugh who win!” Next, to omit it were not good, The honor'd, valiant name of Hood; “And ever as that day returns, “The Muse her tale shall tell, “And sing her sorrow o'er the urns “Of those who bravely fell; “And weave immortal wreaths of fame, “O'er Blair, and Manners' deathless name.” To list of heroes add we now Brave Digby, Barrington, and Howe; Nor must bold Curtis be forgot, Of whom it was the envied lot, To deal his indignation hot On Spanish prows, and with disgrace To drive them from Gibraltar's base; Where matchless Elliot cheers his dauntless band, Firm as the rock on which the warriors stand. Our losses at the close of the war were, the island of Minorca, taken by the Spaniards; St. Eustatius, and St. Martin's, taken by the French,—the Ville de Paris, Glorieux, Hector, Centaur, and Ramillies, foundered at sea;—the melancholy catastrophe of Admiral Kempenfelt in the Royal George, is in the sad recollection of many. Hughes and Suffrein with each a fleet In action indecisive meet, Coote pays off Hyder, in hard blows, A score, of which the reader knows. From wars warm toil allow us breath, To mourn Prince Alfred's early death; Prince Alfred died in 1782. And civic gratitude to praise, Which bids art's fav'rite vot'ries raise A monument of veneration, To Chatham, glory of the nation! Peace, disapproved by Parliament, It's makers out of office sent; Pitt yields to Fox and North who stay In Coalition scarce a day; The state wheel turns, and fate thinks fit Again to smile on William Pitt. It is not our intent to follow Each turn of In and Out view hollow; But sometimes in our quiet ride, Glance en passant at either side. Strange Meteors fright old men and wives, Amelia's birth delights our King and Queen; From India unpropitious news arrives, Our forces both by land and sea suffered severely in India, just as the news of peace arrived to put an end to hostilities, and this was the final operation of the late war. And Prince Octavius quits this mortal scene. Election broils now come in play, 1784. 'Twixt Fox and Hood, and Cecil Wray; Handel's august commemoration, Electrifies the list'ning nation; And, useful to the Muse, she hails Palmer, thy Post-impelling Mails: May thy claim's “laboursome petition,” Wring justice, slow, from opposition. Johnson, thy vast, thy comprehensive mind, With all it's Herculean store Of elegant, not superficial, lore, Is by the will of Heav'n to death consign'd. The monument thou leav'st behind,— Thy Works,—like the famed Torso, greatly prove Our praise, or imitation, far above. In sev'nteen hundred eighty-five, The all-expectant world's alive, To hear how Warren Hastigns, tried, 1785. Such inquisition might abide, As, when once brought before his Peers, They wove and wove for years and years; As if, like Old Ulysses' bride, Their daily knots the night untied, At length, both sides to plead admitted, The Governor most amply is acquitted. The Shop-tax for a while disturbs the town, 'Till he who plann'd it, wisely laid it down. 1786. Commercial plans with France and Spain we sign, On base of reciprocity, And faith and friendship mutually combine, 'Gainst future animosity. When, suddenly, a frantic maniac's hand, Margaret Nicholson attempted to stab His Majesty with a knife she had concealed in the folds of a petition, which he was just reaching his hand to receive; she proved to be insane, and was directed, under the most humane attention, to be confined in Bethlem Hospital. Masking in suppliant guise th' insidious knife, Had nearly plunged in mourning all the land, By sacrifice of our lov'd parent's life. Nor know her wand'ring senses to this hour, What parricidal guilt her hands had dyed; Had not kind heaven interposed it's pow'r, And turn'd the murd'rous implement aside. While thanks for George's preservation rise, Amelia, his royal sister, dies. 1787. Next might we open a vast, boundless theme, Of wond'rous narrative, more like a dream Than semblant to the style of sober pens, I mean when civil dæmons left their dens: With specious garb, and demagogues' deep wile, Who look like peace, yet “murder while they smile.” Oh, hapless Gallia, 'tis for thee we mean These plaints, and happy for the Muse, I ween, Not her's the task to trace each blood-stain'd scene Thy mourning streets, thy fanes, thine altars saw; That fierce despite of loyalty and law Which rent asunder ev'ry sacred tie, In Reason's name bade all of reason die, And call'd the gaunt delirium Liberty! Pass we the horrors of thy princes slain, Pass we where lovely woman falls unspared; Pass we where brutes o'er heroism reign, While red-eyed Revolution wildly glared. My Muse disclaims each deed of crime or glory, But what alone relates to British story. 1788. Lord George, who led the chapel-burning crew, Now quits his creed, and owns himself a Jew. Mansfield, the sage judicial chief, expires: And, with respect and sympathy, we state, Hygæia from our sov'reign's cheeks retires, And (while a prey to fev'rish fires The monarch suffers,) harsh debate, And wrath unseemly, in the senate rise. Then, Thurlow, it was thine to prize 1789 Thy master's welfare, and exclaim, (Never forgotten be thy fame)! “Whene'er unmindful of my King I prove “Unmindful be of me the God I love!” Then Pitt! too, leader of that band Who, in the sov'reign, served the land, O'erpaid thy loyal efforts then, When reason dawning on the best of men, Pointed his faithful friends to his regard, And feeling, reft of words, essay'd reward. The King's recovery was given As sudden blessing sent from Heaven, To interpose when Discord's voice, In accents hoarse, bade fiends rejoice; But Providence withdrew the veil, The dæmon's fell intentions fail: And in the sacred dome, His Majesty went in solemn procession to St. Paul's to return thanks for his recovery. by crouded hearts Surrounded, George his gratitude imparts, To where Sincerity will still prevail. Burke, and his friend Charles Fox who used to feel 1790. But one opinion; now with so much zeal On Gallic questions seize, that neither yield, While all their former friendship quits the field. Cornwali's decease the Speaker's chair bestows On Addington, whose worth the country knows; Some frantic hand again the King assails, A stone was thrown at His Majesty by one John Frith, a half-pay lieutenant, which fortunately missed the royal person: Frith being proved insane, upon trial, was sent to a proper place of confinement. It's aim, to ev'ry subject's rapture, fails. Franklin and Howard pay great nature's debt, For virtue in a philosophic dress, The first renown'd; the second no one yet Hopes to surpass, while many a 'prison'd wretch, Far as the hand of time will stretch, Shall find some cause his memory to bless. 1791. Indian King Tippoo calls his chiefs to arms, And hence begins a scene of lengthen'd strife, Which keeps the Eastern world in dire alarms, 'Till Tippoo's empire closes with his life. To seek that school of military fame Which venerable Frederick The great King of Prussia. form'd to guide The youthful warrior, teach him how to blend With valours vehemence the needful curb Which discipline supplies, the royal York, Our sov'reign's second hope, had gone erewhile: And as those maxims he imbibed, which since In practice have secured the love of all, Of each, or high or low, whom his command Embraces;—there, ere yet matured his aims To make the British soldier prize his lot, To shelter from distress the widow, wife, Or parent of the fearless youth who rush On Gallic squadrons in their country's cause: To rear the sons of Albion to renown, By theories which mingle in the mind Lights of religion and humanity, And form the christian soldier in the man. While great intents like these his wish employ'd, Still softer feelings stole upon his mind, Prussia's fair pride, the daughter of his host, Taught the young soldier, that, from beauty's glance No angle of the heart, howe'er by lines Of caution fortified, is quite secure. The sires of Britain and of Prussia smiled, And blest their offsprings union, England saw Her Prince's choice with pride, and hail'd with joy The day by Hymen destined to entwine With Frederica, Fred'rick's fate for life His Royal Highness married the Princess Royal of Prussia, at Berlin, was re-married at St. James's the December following and most magnificently received at court with his royal bride. The sons of Afric from their “hundred thrones,” Have cause to bless enlightened Britain's voice, Which, in full senate, the detested trade Of human traffic marks with fit rebuke; Places a bound to it's nefarious powers, Various resolutions were proposed by the opposers of the slave trade and after long debates and the rejection of many proposals, a motion was carried that the abolition be final in January, 1796, this afterwards met much opposition from the Lords. Pow'rs doom'd at length to wither! pow'rs accurs'd! Which sacrificed to avarice, (as of old Moloch's fell shrine was wet with infant blood,) Freedom and life, and ev'ry heaven sent good: The virgin's hope, the husband's virtuous bliss, The father's fondness, and the mother's joy; And, above all, the patriotic flame Which, whether in the frozen arctic isles Where stormy Zembla rears her ice-clad hills, Or on the burning sands of Araby, For ever vibrates on the feeling soul. Like to that magic song of Home, The celebrated Swiss air called the “Rans des Vaches.” which tunes Helvetian hearts to mournful ecstacy! No patriot he, no genuine Briton born Who, basking in the beams of liberty, Wou'd rise to wealth upon the servile chains He heaps on fellow man! No freedom his Whose mind (the worst of slav'ry) wears the badge Of cursed thirst for gain;—but, oh! for him Whose open heart, whose large enlighten'd mind, Cou'd advocate the cause of wretchedness; 1792. Expose the narrow selfish craft, which stain'd The name of Commerce; rescue from reproach The British merchant's honor, and restore Degraded man, (yet not abased so low As those who dare degrade him,) to his rights, What rapture must be his! his manly heart, Sentient for others, in itself must feel Myriads of blessings, first by him bestow'd, Returning on the source from whence they sprang! Now Payne, the demagogue, began To circulate his “Rights of Man;” And mad enthusiastic fools Of deep designing knaves the tools, With Hudibrastic fury swelling, Long'd to “ride forth a Colonelling.” Kings, Priests, and Peers, at one fell sweep, They sentenced to “Eternal Sleep; For thus, with philosophic breath, The new Scholastics christen'd death, Religion, henceforth petty treason, Was merely soften'd down to Reason; The raising a domestic storm, Was prettily misnamed Reform; And sending thousands to their graves, Saved them, of course, from being slaves. Equality, that lovely word, For which so many drew the sword, Meant only, that industrious worth Shou'd with the idlest rogue on earth Share the fair produce of his labour; And, when thus pillaged, rob his neighbour. Well had the world run round, I wot, Had things fall'n out—as they did not; How decently at Church, (I mean In Reason's Temple,) had been seen Our British fair, no longer prudes, Improved to lib'ral minded Nudes; Returning home, for dinner ready, Our servants, in the good cause steady, Wou'd condescend to wait at table, Or tend the kitchen, or the stable, Provided master, and my dame, Were pleased in turn to do the same; While citizens, Dick, Poll, and Bobby, In Gallic costume, sans culotte, Preambulate park, street, and lobby, By lady's robe bedeck'd, and lord's best coat. Eastward the Muse now points the view, to where The son of Hyder leads his Rajah-poots, From Ganges' banks, and arms the native tribes Of Hindoo warriors, to poise the spear Against Cornwallis; vain the effort, vain The tiger hunting monarch's wrath, opposed To British firmness.—Tippoo's hostage sons, With store of tributary spoil, confess The triumph of our arms; victorious flies The banner of St. George, and low the Crescent lies. Tippoo Saib was reduced to cede one half his dominions, to pay three crores and thirty lacks of rupees, to give up all prisoners and yield his two eldest sons as hostages for the performance of the treaty. Nor to Hindostan is the war confined, 1793. France revolutionzed, her King bereft Of life by felon hands; her people drunk With anarchy's red cup,—fell discord shakes Her venom locks, the pois'nous drops imbue The shore, the ocean, and their influence spreads To the Batavian coast, and hence, the Scheldt Infecting Britain with a plea for strife, The spirit of dissension burns, nor years Have quench'd the flame terrific, which extends From busy Thames to where Lutetia's towers Reflect their lofty honors in the Seine. On land, unmoved, do Gallia's sons maintain The varied fate of warfare;—on the sea The British trident still asserts it's right 1794. Of empire.—Mark! what thundering peals announce Howe and the glories of the first of June! Six captured floating castles, two destroy'd, The shatter'd remnants of invading prows Put to disgraceful flight, proclaim what boys Of native oak constructed hearts, can do Against determined foes.—The British fleet Scarce injured in the contest, proudly bore Her prizes safely to our grateful shore. The new philosophy essays on land The disciples of the new philosophy at length were noticed by the law, many convicted of sedition and some acquitted of high treason;—the mob at Birmingham taking offence at a party of philosophers who were commemmorating the “glorious” French revolution, proceeded to most dreadful outrages, and after the law had been shamefully violated in the name of church and king, many of the rioters expiated their folly with their lives. The nation to divide, but honest John, True to himself, spurns ev'ry base attempt To cheat him of his rights, in specious name Of Liberty; and give, in lieu of thee Thou lovely goddess ever “fair and free!” A drab, whose blood-stain'd pike and bonnet rouge Mark'd her the mother red-cap of a mob. The saffion vested god, to England's heir 1795. Leads Caroline of Brunswick, pomp and state Upon the royal nuptials wait, And joy's loud acclamations rend the air. H.R. H. the Prince Regent was married on the 8th of April, to his cousin the Princess Caroline of Brunswick. France conquers peace with Spain, both nations join Their pow'rs on land and ocean, to combine Against Old England, who nor courts, nor shuns The war's continuance, but sends her sons, Hotham, Cornwallis, Bridport, o'er the main, Her long asserted title to maintain. Pondicherry, Chandenagore and Mahie were taken from the French, whose settlements in the West Indies were also captured by Sir C. Grey and Sir John Jervis; we likewise took Martinico and St. Lucie. Under French influence, too, the sordid Dutch, Whose cause we had befriended, far too much! Declared against us; yet we stem the tide, And still our gallant ships victorious ride. About this time in reputation rose, The most implacable of England's foes, Napoleon Bonaparte, whose frequent threat Of our destruction (unaccomplished yet); Whatever may have caus'd said threat's prevention, Calls on our gratitude for its intention. Batavian settlements, Batavian fleets, Nearly the whole of the Dutch settlements surrendered to the British arms, and in the month of October, nine sail of Dutch ships, three of the line, five frigates, and sloops, which had entered Saldanha Bay with a view to attack the Cape of Good Hope, yielded, without firing a shot, to Admiral Sir Keith Elphinstone. Surrender to the British—France, too, meets 1796. A check from Irish lads, in Bantry Bay, Whence Gallic chieftains bravely—ran away. With peaceful offers Malmesbury is sent To Paris, and returns just as he went. Jamaica feels the scourge of civil jar, 'Till British valour terminates the war. This was called the Maroon War; the Maroons were descendants of the Spanish slaves, who refused to submit when the English first took possession of the island;—twenty battles terminated in their entire submission. Hope of the House of Brunswick, England's care, The birth of Charlotte glads the Royal pair. A caution, meant to save from future harm, Involves the nation in no small alarm, 1797. Which spreads with light'nings speed from rank to rank, When guineas ceas'd to issue from the Bank; External and internal enemies Have subsequently prov'd the measure wise. Now Continental freedom loses hope, And Bonaparte triumphs o'er the Pope. At sea two proud achievements gild the page, Each unsurpass'd in any clime or age; First Jervis, long to be remember'd name! Against Iberia wins immortal fame; Fifteen to twenty-five! St. Vincent's saw The gallant Briton give the Spaniard law. Sir John Jervis with 15 sail attacked a Spanish fleet of 25, passed rapidly through their line, tacked, and separated one third from the main body, after a partial cannonade, which prevented their rejunction in the evening; by which manœuvre 4 line of battle ships were taken, and their whole fleet defeated with very trivial loss to the English. Next Duncan's prowess claim'd no less renown When Holland struck her flag off Camperdown. Admiral Duncan broke the Dutch line, a-la-Jervis, and in two hours and a half took their Admiral and 9 ships of the line. The hero of Camperdown was in consequence created an English Peer, by the title of Earl St. Vincent. Our pious Sovereign and his joyful Court, In solemn state to Paul's proud fane resort; Preceded by the lads whom Vincent, Howe, And Duncan, led to fame; they grateful bow Before the Giver of success; display, And consecrate the trophies of the day. Impartial verity, alas! compels What with reluctance the historian tells: The bulwarks of our empire o'er the main, Bring on their name a momentary stain; Britain had ne'er such cause to mourn, before Her Naval sons' defection at the Nore; And never may such cause occur again. The leader punish'd of the daring plot, Alike his crime and mem'ry be forgot! France sends her heroes to invade North Wales, Thro' Taffy's zeal the well-meant project fails. Lord Malmesbury is sent once more to treat Of peace, our foes the kind intent defeat. Lord Malmesbury was sent to treat with the French Commissioners at Lisle, but was unable to procure honourable terms of peace. The King of Prussia and John Wilkes, of whom We twice have spoken, seek the silent tomb. Hibernia, sister of our Isle! With whom to share sweet Union's smile Is ev'ry honest Briton's aim, Why shou'd the Muse those ills proclaim 1798. Which from our mutual foemen sprung! To discord shall the harp be strung? No, brother Pat, tho' rudely sung, My wild attempt would fain combine The blended beauties of the nine; And above all to sing of thee With most fraternal harmony. The Frenchmen this year tried their luck, Without success, at Ballinmuck; The French landed at Killala Bay, and were subsequently obliged to surrender. Ireland and England, hand in hand, Repell'd the bold intrusive band. Who next arrests bright vict'ries smile? HORATIO NELSON OF THE NILE: Cent'ries to come shall hail the day Of conquest in Aboukir Bay; Not on the main each adverse fleet With equal chance of conquest meet,— But Gallia's leading warrior rides Guarded by shelter at his back, While Nelson, whom time, place, nor tides, Deterr'd from once-resolv'd attack. So plied the foe with British thunder, So rent his phalanx line asunder, That, scarce recover'd from surprise, Their ships, consuming, tint the skies: And dread explosion tells the tremb'ling shore, The floating pride of Frenchmen is no more; That Nelson's warlike genius rules the fight, And conquer'd L'Orient sets in endless night. Nine sail of the line were taken, L'Orient of 120 guns, another ship of the line, and a frigate were burned or blew up in action; two only of the French feet escaped; their Admiral Bruyes, lost his life in the engagement; for this brilliant and most important service, our hero was created Baron Nelson of the Nile, and his Sicilian Majesty confered on him the title of Duke of Bronti. Say, bitterest foe of British isles, When thy best fortune on thee smiles, Does not remembrance of that fearful night Fill thine ambitious bosom with affright? Did it not certainly foretell That breasts of steel who fought so well Would soon thy mad career appal, As Sydney did, at Acre's Wall, Wou'd put thy stoutest hearts to flight, As Stewart did at Maida fight; Wou'd drive thy hordes from Egypt's shore, As Abercrombie, now no more, Began to do, while those he left Of all thy laurels thee bereft? Did no presentiment foretell Thine upstart glory's passing bell, When, starting from thy tyrant reign, In fury rose awakened Spain, Did nothing sadly prophecy Of Wellington and Victory? Or didst thou never turn thine eyes From Jaffa and thy cruelties? To the, then little thought, bare chance That all the pride and flow'r of France, Led by thy sateless thirst of pow'r, In Russian climes, should curse the hour When thy ambition lured them forth, To perish in the hostile North; When millions, by thy schemes misled, For whom?—A stranger—fought and bled. Thou! prodigal of human blood, Whom British senators descend to praise; For thee and thy dire practices too good Are even these most inexpressive lays. The Gallic chief, with fury in his eye, Beholds the British flag triumphant fly; And, pow'rless to revenge great Nelson's deed, The turban'd victims of his anger bleed; 1799. And more of des lation had profaned The sacred land and Jaffa's conduits stained, But that another Briton barr'd his way, Cross'd his fell purposes from day to day; And where, of yore, in a less holy cause, Fierce Cœur-de-Lion gave the battle laws; In modern day did Sydney shake the tower And pinnacle of Napoleon's power: Who, conscious that his fortune still must yield When such opponents met him in the field, Bravely resolved (the Moniteur would say) To 'tempt the ocean, rather than to stay. Nelson's victory seemed to deprive the French of all succour from the Continent; and the Turks, being reinforced by a small body of English, under the command of Sir Sydney Smith, the French were subjected to innumerable distresses and defeats, when an unexpected scheme was put in execution by Bonaparte, which was no other than that of making his escape from Egypt. Pennant, thine antiquarian labours cease With gallant Howe, death calls thy soul to peace. Tippoo, the mighty Sultan of Mysore, Falls, with his capital, to rise no more; Much we rejoice when Britain's arms succeed, Yet much regret to see a monarch bleed, Defending to the last, in mortal fight, What surely less was ours than his good right. The conquerors of Austerlitz we hate, Who not succeed thro' rectitude, but fate; And Indian princes, who ne'er thought Of British interference, ought Maintain their ancient rights against, or trade, Or what, or whom their native land, invade; Correction here may offer a short word, To say that Tippoo was not rightful lord Of what he died for; that bold Hyder's son Defended what his sire by force had won, While we the legal Rajah's heir restored. Kistna Rajah Oidaver, the only child of Chiaum Rauze, or Raige, (five of whose seven wives are living), was placed on the Musnud, or throne, of the deceased Rajah, on the 60th of June, at the old town of Mysore; the ceremony was performed by General Harris, as senior Member of the British Commission, and Meer Allum, acting for his Highness the Nizam. The deportment of the young Prince, who was only five years old, is described as having been remarkably decorous. Vide Lonsdale's Narrative Sketches of the Conquest of the Mysore. It may be so, but truth says, after all, The Musnud of Mysore is Leadenhall. Painful thy task, O Bard, to sing Of danger to our much-loved King, 1800. Yet pleasure every heart must feel to know That Providence averts each nearly fatal blow: See, with a parent leader's pride, Round his brave troops the Monarch ride; From some fell tube the leaden death, Which clse had robb'd our Sire of breath, By heaven's kind aid is turn'd aside: Scarce had the sun that memorable day On ocean's surface ceas'd to play, When, as his people's shouts their Sovereign hail, They see a desp'rate hand his life assail; At Drury-Lane Theatre. Yes, while surrounded by each dearest friend, Wife, children, all that love and friendship blend, His family of Britons mark'd how near The King of terrors,—while with doubt and fear All were impress'd, save one, that one was he Who knew not but he yet might be The victim of a fatal shot reserved; Yes, George, by interposing heav'n preserved, With confidence, as brave as mild, Bow'd to his people, sigh'd, and smiled! Made the assassin's safety first his care, And bade his guards the unhappy maniac spare. On Union with our Sister Isle May genuine friendship ever smile; May jealousies, and fears and doubts, Created, or by ins or outs, Yield to a hearty social band Of love and faith 'twixt either land. Malta, the ancient knightly seat Of many a gallant warlike feat, Yields to the British arms; and mark Where Abercrombie's glorious lads embark For Egypt's shore, where let the Muse, poor elf, Quote one or two short stanzas from herself. 1801. “Twas on the spot in ancient lore oft named, “Where Isis and Osiris once held sway “O'er kings who sleep in pyramidic pride, “But now for British valour far more famed, “Since Nelson's band achieved a glorious day, “And, crown'd with laurel, Abercrombie died.” “Her roseate colours the dawn had not shed “O'er the field, which stern slaughter had tinted too red, “All was dark, save each flash at the cannon's hoarse sound, “When the brave Abercrombie received his death wound! “With a mind unsubdued still the foe he defied “On the steed which the Hero of Acre supplied, “Till, feeling he soon to fate's summons must yield, “He gave Sydney the sword he no longer could wield. “The standard of Britain by victory crown'd, “Wav'd over that head which now sank to the ground! “His comrades with grief unaffected deplore, “While to Albion's renown he adds one laurel more.” Vide T. Dibdin's Songs. And large the laurel the lov'd warrior gave, Purchased with life!—to his all-honor'd grave Let every manly trait of patriot woe, With beauty's pearly tear, co-mingled go: What centuries of most sincere regret Can to his mem'ry pay the nation's debt?— Our debt to him whom nor destructive surge, Nor all that Gallic arms and tactics urge, Cou'd bar a passage on that very shore Where Nelson's thunders had been heard before; To him the glorious conflict who began, Which drove Napoleon's legions, to a man, To quit, inglorious, that much-injur'd strand, Where violence and rapine bade them land; To him who founded an immortal name Upon a fugitive invader's shame! It were too much intrusion here to tell, The day on which great Abercrombie fell Was, Reader, (tho' unworthy thy regard) The birth-day of your humble, wou'd-be, Bard. Britannia's thunder to the echoing Sound, Proclaims that Nelson leads to Danish ground; His meteor train the northern foe appals, And to their base shakes Copenhagen's walls. Here Moss and Riou for their country bled, And join'd in better worlds the patriot dead. Denmark and Sweden now to peace attend, And Paul's demise, of Russia makes a friend. Saumarez adds to former gain Of laurels, at expence of Spain. Sir James Saumarez engaged a Spanish squadron, of superior force, with so much gallantry, that two three deckers of the enemy exploded during the action, and their other ships were so much shattered that it was with the greatest difficulty they escaped into Cadiz. The Premier, wearied by incessant strife Of Opposition to his Public Life, Resigns,—Dundas and Grenville too, Windham and Spencer bid adieu To all the pomp and circumstance of pow'r; While Addington essays the sweet and sour Of Grandeur's careful, transitory hour. Next let our narrative declare (For give and take, good friends, is fair), When on Boulogne we made attack, Our gallant lads were beaten back. On this theme, therefore, let us cease, And talk of oh! much wish'd for Peace; 1802. Of short duration though, I fear; It lasted, let me see, a year, The Treaty of Amiens was signed in March; 1802, scarcely a year had elapsed when the representations of Lord Whitworth, respecting some French and Dutch armaments, were answered by the first Consul with so much personal rudeness and “such a striking neglect of dignity and propriety,” that our ambassador was compelled to return home, and war recommenced in May, 1803. 'Ere France the scarcely-finish'd compact broke, Unsheath'd the sword, and challeng'd Hearts of Oak; 1803. Swore England's commerce should exist no more, And menaced freemen upon Freedom's shore! Then “what ensued?” will future times demand: Say, did the spoilers reach the threaten'd land? No! Britons with enthusiastic fire, In patriotic phalanx rallied round their sire; All were united in the sacred cause Of Liberty, Religion, King, and Laws; All swore for these to conquer or to die! Vow'd on each other strongly to rely; All kept the sacred bond, and still their foes defy. The treacherous chief of Gaul, whose soul delights In violating hospitable rights, Seiz'd on those British, who, in luckless hour, Had deem'd that honor in his breast had power: And, when the prison'd guests their right demand, Ironic insult, and degrading jeer, Our sons deride, and mock our daughters' ear. When Autun's Bishop came to Albion's strand, What courtesy but greeted Talleyrand? A name on which for ever now must rest This hated stigma, “the Ungrateful Guest,” Who Briton's noblest favors could requite With ev'ry act of mean official spite. This, at that time, confidential minister of the French court, and to whom the English nobility had been prodigally hospitable, in their own country, is accused in many instances of personal and degrading ill-treatment of the detenus, particularly to a venerable Scotch Countess, to whom, when she pleaded for indulgence on her knees, he laughingly said, he could neither understand her French nor her English. Despard, and his associate crew, Receive from injured law their due. A sudden burst, in which a Magistrate Of worth and virtue meets a cruel fate, Upon Hibernian ground appals the good; His very murderers mourn Kilwarden's blood! Kilwarden, whose last palpitating breath, Forgave th' infuriate authors of his death! Grinfield and Hood, and Saumarez, at sea, Their true blue warriors lead to victory; General Grinfield and Commodore Hood took St. Lucia, Tobago, Demarara, Issequibo, &amp;c.—Berbice was also captured. Sir James Sanmarez attacked the port of Granville, demolished the pier, and destroyed many vessels designed for the invasion of England; Dieppe was bombarded the same day by Captain Owen; and a number of vessels were taken, or rendered useless, in the Dutch harbours. While Dieppe and Dutchmen found some cause to rue What Owen and associate chiefs cou'd do. In India, Wellesley triumphs o'er the foe, (Such names make shocking poetry I trow, As Rajah Berar, Scindia Dowlat Bow). Marquis Wellesley obtained a decisive victory over the Berar Rajah and Dowlat Bow Scindia, and their combined forces. The Hindostan East Indiaman was lost in Margate Roads on the 11th of January. Less fortunate at home the current ran, Which in its vortex sunk the Hindostan. Now Addington and friends uneasy sit, 1804. And yield the ministerial throne to Pitt. Behold Linois against our lads advance, Sets, turns his partners, and declines the Dance. Capt. N. Dance in the Farl Camden East Indiaman, while convoying twenty-six merchantmen, fell in with and beat off the squadron of Admiral Linois, consisting of a line of battle ship, two frigates, a corvette, and a brig. La liberté no more the Frenchman sings, For mark! th' Imperial Eagle claps his wings! Wou'd you, my reader kind, survey Such ensigns of despotic sway, A moment to Whitehall repair, You'll see a splendid sample there, Which with our brethren brave were forc'd to stay While their unpinion'd owners fled away. Talking of Eagles, 'tis grand news, by jingo, Which reaches us from St. Domingo, Another self-dubb'd monstrous great I, Makes his debut as Emperor of Hayti. The German Emp'ror, too, commands proclaim, That henceforth Austria bear th' imperial name. And next, with most unwilling strain, We sing of war proclaim'd with Spain. A sail appears,—a flag of truce 1805. From France, which proves of little use; Our answer, surely just and wise, Refused to treat without allies. Two ships from Spain Sir Robert Calder wins: And now the Muse's hardest task begins; Nelson, thy sacred name, thy matchless worth, Which might the fire of Phœbus self call forth, Leave me o'erpower'd,—else shou'd the unequal lay Soar boldly to that blaze of endless day, Which, emanating from thy great renown, With dazzling glory gilds thy naval crown! Nelson, revolving mighty deeds gone by, Favor'd with hopes of future victory, Greatly impatient for the coming fight, Began at length to droop; prophetic sight Of something like the glorious day Which memorized Trafalgar bay, Floated before the hero's wishful eye; Yet would the grateful vision call a sigh, As if, unconsciously, the warrior's mind His all lamented envied fate divined. At hope deferr'd while Nelson sicken'd, Still hope renew'd, his ardor quicken'd; At length his comprehensive brain Suggested certain means to gain His heart's desire—the wary chief Lulls his opposers to belief, To lure the enemy from port, the gallant Admiral kept his fleet out of sight, but established a chain of communication by frigates. Admiral Villeneuve at length ventured out, with 33 sail of the line, 7 frigates, and 8 corvettes, and sustained a most memorabfe discomfiture from a British fleet of only 26 sail of the line, with a proportionate number of frigates. That, weary of the fond pursuit, Despairing to enjoy the fruit Of ceaseless watching day and night, Retiring, he declined the fight. Little they fathom'd that capacious soul, Which heav'n foredoom'd from pole to pole Shou'd spread the fame of British tars Beyond the praise of former wars; Nineteen ships of the line and three flag officers were taken by the British: our ever-regretted Admiral fell by a musquet ball in the middle of the action; a public funeral was decreed his remains; his brother created a Viscount and Earl of the United Kingdoms, and suitable estates purchased for the support of that dignity; £2000 per annum was voted to Lady Nelson; Admiral Colling wood was elevated to the Peerage, with a pension of £2000; and an ample contribution was raised for those who were wounded in the action, and for the surviving relatives of those who had fallen. The cautious foe first scans the vacant wave, So soon to be of slaughter'd hosts the grave, Conceives, at length, he fearless may appear, Nor dreams of Nelson's genius hov'ring near. The naval boast of our most happy isle, Welcomed th' astonish'd squadrons with a smile; “They're mine,” he cried,—along the awful line, Fate answer'd him in thunder, “they are thine!” But first the patriot signal proudly flew, “England expects his duty each will do.” And did they? Witness for them, bounteous heaven, If ever signal more appropriate given Could better be obeyed.—“Now,” loudly cried The British chief, “quick place me by the side “Of an oft met opponent, man to man!” The helmsman answered; the dread fray began, And Trinidada's decks in purple torrents run. Well did they fight, 'ere Nelson's setting sun Its golden radiance proudly shed Around the laurel'd chieftain's head; Round his, who with his latest sigh Bless'd the great God of Victory; And, in his last expiring prayer, His country was the hero's care. NELSON's FUNERAL. Who shall describe what Britain felt, In grateful sorrow while she knelt, Grateful for laurels proudly won, Convuls'd with sorrow for her son; And mark! to shed the patriot tear O'er him whose victory cost so dear: Behold a mighty nation throng, And see the sad procession slowly moves along; To paint it, wou'd it were my lot To hold the pen of Wizard Scott, So might I sing each plaided chief Who led the pomp of that day's grief; Of solemn dirges might I tell, Which on the ear lugubrious swell; While tristful pipers fling around The coronach's impressive sound, And fancy's whispering minstrelsy, Recals the Bards “Och Hone a Rie!” Vide the Poem of Glenfinlass, in the Minstrelsy of the Scottish border. So might I sing each gallant band, Defenders of our envied land, Who erst in many a well-fought field Had forc'd the Gallic standard yield; And now in battle's dread array, The whole Procession of Infantry, Cavalry, and Artillery, marched in Order of battle. Add awful lustre to the day. Next, speaking closely to the heart, What pleasure might the Muse impart If those she sung, the gallant brave, Who on the late impurpled wave Had shared the dangers of that day, Which snatch'd our naval hope away. The sons of Albion, with revering eye, Beheld the mild, yet daring, host pass by, Whose iron sinews to its destin'd aim Had dragg'd each mouth which dealt the dreadful flame Of Britain's indignation.—I have said Whose iron sinews, but whose manly hearts, The battle over, soft as infant love, Wept, with no common tears, their father slain. Much had the “pomp and circumstance of war” Impress'd the gazing thousands, and the bands Of England's champions who, with martial step, Preceded, challenged grateful reverence; But when, in costume unadorned, yet neat, The warriors of the main, with downcast eye And carriage unassuming, pass'd along, What British youth, whate'er his noble rank, Whate'er the splendid fortunes he might own, But (were he truly British) wou'd have given All, in exchange, to have been one of those Who, side by side with Nelson, had appal'd, Each in himself a lion, those proud souls Who had most rashly dared to threat the soil Which gave such feeling and such valour birth! Not one of this bold train who meekly pass'd, But for some merit in the day of days Had been distinguished. Dare the Sacred Band, Which from his northern perils help'd escort The high-prais'd Emperor of Gaul, assume A parallel with these?—But hold, my muse! Let no commixture sully the great name Which, tamely treated as it is, demands From its intrinsic grandeur, pure applause. “Peace to the heroes' souls! their bodies die, “Their fames shall ever live in memory!” The gallant Strachan, in their forced reteat, Captured the poor remains of Gallia's fleet. Sir Richard Strachan, with an equal force, captured one 80 and three 74 gun French ships, which had escaped from the battle of Trafalgar. The Abergavenny Indiaman foundered off Portland this year. Our Aberga'ny, to the sea a prize, Still on the rocky shore of Portland lies. Austria to France submits, from Presburg's towers, Peace is proclaimed between the adverse powers. This year we lose the Brother of our King; His Royal Highness the late Duke of Gloucester. This year another loss we grieve to sing, Cornwallis great and good, on Indian soil, Closes a life of patriotic toil. And scarce another year its course began, 1806. 'Ere Pitt, illustrious, unequalled man! Pitt, Napoleon's eyesore, scourge of Gaul, Pitt, victim of his virtues, doom'd to fall, From libel-stain'd malignity retired, Sigh'd for his much-lov'd country, and expired! “Statesman, yet friend to truth,” thy spirit now From blissful realms beholds opposers bow To thy true patriotic policy, Source of each heart inspiring victory; That, conquering Wellington! for wakened Spain, And Lusitania, it is thine to gain The persevering plans to Pitt we owe, Which since have laid Gaul's schemes of conquest low. Pitt's fire of opposition to a chief, Whose grasping rage for conquest pass'd belief, Spreading through frozen regions of the North, Have driven that merciless invader forth, Who, when in height of power we saw him sit, No Briton flatter'd but the foes of Pitt! Now all the Talents (great applause!) Come in;—then, past a doubt, The nation's saved!! Not yet, because The Talents all—go out. Thus Fortune's fickle will disposes Of ministerial beds of roses. Was't not enough to see, by fate's fell blow, Cornwallis, Nelson, Pitt, at once laid low; But our remaining stay, our senate's pride, Fox, shou'd so soon in death be placed beside The man, who equally his country's friend, By diff'rent means pursued the same good end. Par Fratrum nobile, tho' long opposed, Yet each his life with highest honours closed; Each, when subsided popular acclaim, Will rank in Britain's love with equal fame: Each now looks down from worlds beyond the grave, On that lov'd country each aspir'd to save; And, were return permitted, hand in hand, Wou'd Union's blessings point to Briton's land. Fox had succeeded to the Statesman's throne, Which Pitt's demise made vacant; when his own Open'd the country's wounds—Tierney and Grey, Holland, and Sidmouth, bore co-equal sway. Popham, and Baird, and Duckworth tell the foe More tales like those we told them long ago. The Cape of Good Hope surrendered to General Baird and Sir Home Popham; Admiral Duckworth captured three line of battle ships, and destroyed two others, near St. Domingo. Defective Prussia, most unlike a Prince To England acted;—once that's ever since, The step she has regretted, which may prove The moral consequence of Gallia's love. Melville's acquittal; and, (we ought to thank A deed which brought a million to the Bank). The capture of Buenos Ayres, tells That British spirit still in Britain dwells. From Maida's plains another laurel springs, ('Twas wormwood to the Emperor of Kings), The chosen of th' imperial squadrons meet The British bayonet—their swift retreat Proclaims beyond the pow'r of words, That Gallic threats are sharper than their swords. Sicilia welcomes Stewart and his band, As saviours of an innovated land. 1807. Perceval takes the reins, and next we speak Of what the Leopard and the Chesapeake Produced to satisfy the fell desire Of those who wou'd promote dissensions ire. America, may mutual sense of right Our present boken friendship re-unite! At Buenos Ayres, and on the Turkish coast, We're free to own, we hadn't much to boast; In Egypt, measure of mischance to fill, We, certainly, were less successful still. Ill fated Copenhagen once more knows Of warfare (to her dwellings brought) the woes. Eighteen ships of the line, fifteen frigates, six smaller vessels, and twenty-five gunboats, were given up to the British armament which was sent to bombard Copenhagen. The Slave Trade, to Humanity's encrease, By pre-arrangements mention'd, now must cease; Louis of France, (the cause each good man grieves,) Our isle, with hospitable arms receives; The sov'reign's sister joyful meets once more Th' unequal'd comforts of her native shore. Lured by Napoleon's promised grace, General Savary, while persuading the King of Spain to go to Bayonne, once went so far as to say, “I will suffer my head to be cut off, if, within a quarter of an hour after your majesty's arrival, the Emperor shall not have recognised you as King of Spain and the Indies;”—notwithstanding this, he was told, after dining with the Usurper, that none of the Bourbon family could be permitted to reign. The Spanish monarch quits his place, 1808. And Bayonne witnesses the cheat, Which threw Spain under an usurper's feet. 'Till Britain, arbitress of Europe's good, Expends for Spain her treasures and her blood! Dupont and Moncey, with Duhesme, first find The awful efforts of Iberia's mind; Baylen, Valentia, Sarragossa prove How People prize the liberty they love. Of new made king, august Madrid, Was in a mighty hurry rid; “A cut-purse,” as we somewhere else have read, “Of realms and empire,” not upon his head He wore the “precious diadem,” they say, But “in his pocket” bore the prize away. The Regalia was literally stolen from Madrid by the Usurper. At Cintra's bargain, millions justly scoff, And thought Junot came much too cheaply off; And so he did, when Vimiera's fight, (Disgrace of France, and Britain's proud delight,) Had taught the arrogant, intruding, elves, Who felt not others sorrows, for themselves To feel and fear:—but subsequent event, By Heav'n, in aid of British valour, sent; Has richly equipois'd the gen'rous fault, Which British liberality had made. The 'whelming force of Napoleon's arms Gave Usurpation's cause a transient hour Blood-red and dark; when, lo! a dawn of light “Walk'd o'er the hills” of Spanish liberty. The germ of glory which has since illumed A generous nation struggling for her rights; And, while lamented Moore with honor fell, Did Wellesley fashion deeds which future days With doubtful retrospection will regard, As passing far that boundary of truth Which faithful history may ne'er exceed, 1809. Gambier and Cochrane Lords Gambier and Cochrane attacked the French fleet in Basque Roads, when one ship of 120 guns, five of 74, and two frigates, were driven on shore, and afterwards totally destroyed, or rendered useless; one of 80, two of 74, and one of 50, with three frigates, were burnt, either by the assailants or their own crews. teach the fleet of France That even their own harbours ill secure The objects of a British tar's attack. The Russian's too, by Hankey's valour find, (Hankey! who purchased victory with life,) What Spartan courage animates the souls Of English seamen in Old England's cause. Lieutenant Hankey, (who was killed in the action) with the boats of four ships, attacked a strong flotilla of Russian gunboats, which were supposed to be impregnably stationed in Pensacola bay; they were, however, not only taken or destroyed, but a most valuable convoy captured with them. Three captured first rates, frigates two, And twenty transports eke, In Rosas' Bay, the worth, true blue, Of Collingwood bespeak. Great bustle for a sad event, By Ministers is made; And those who were to Walch'ren sent At home had better staid. 'Twere best the consequence to pass, Since sorrow will not save The gallant lads who found, alas! A pestilential grave. For credit's sake too, we omit, How disappointment cruel Made Ministers, in angry fit, Go forth and fight a duel. It had long been rumoured that the members of the British Cabinet by no means agreed among themselves; and the failure of the Expedition against Walcheren encreased their disputes to so high a degree, that a public appeal to the pistol took place between two ministers holding the highest official situations in the state: they fired twice, and one of the combatants receiving a wound in the thigh, the affair terminated. But while the people full of ire These degradations see, A nobler subject shall inspire My humble Muse and me. George, (whom no Minister's mistake His people's warm regard can shake,) Enters the Fiftieth Year that he Had ruled the sons of liberty; Who now forgetting party rout, Of Whig or Tory, In or Out, Unite in general Jubilee. The sons of Britain, and the British fair, In public thanksgiving repair, To Him who, from his throne on high, Rules king's and subject's destiny. The naked cloathed, the debtor freed, The hungry fed, and many a deed Of brotherly affection see, Grace Britain's year of Jubilee. And when the festive day was ended, And Sol to Thetis' lap descended, What blaze of artificial light Succeeded to illume the night! With patriot motto, gay design, Victorious emblem, all the nine Descended in united glee, “To celebrate the Jubilee.” May Time on softest pinion move, Nor urge the gently rolling sand; That years to come our King may prove Lord of all hearts in Albion's land; And Britons long united be As at our gen'ral Jubilee! Another glorious theme demands Congratulory lays, While grateful home and distant lands Re-echo Wellesley's praise. To Britain from a distant shore, Fame-wafted comes-the battles roar, And Gallia's eagle ceas'd to soar Where British valour reigns; Where Wellington his flag unfurl'd For Lusitania; Spain; the World! On Talavera's plains. The enemy were beaten across the Alberche, with the loss of twenty pieces of cannon, and nearly 10,000 men, killed and wounded, among the former were Generals Larive and Malot, among the latter, Generals Sebastiani and Boulet. The loss of the British was proportionably severe, amounting to 6000 killed, wounded, and missing. Alas for Austria, whose descending star Yields where the Corsican directs the war; Be patient Muse, succeeding happier times Shall subjects yield for more enliv'ning rhymes Than these, which tell that Austria, forced to fight For the existence of her ev'ry right, Fails in all efforts, and, perforce, receives Such peace as conquering France most proudly gives. The insulting conduct of the French Court subsequent to the treaty of Presburgh, compelled the Emperor Francis to unsheath the sword. The capture of Vienna, and the battle of Wagram, decided the campaign against him. The heroic Tirolese were also subjugated; their glorious leader, Hoffer, murdered in military form; and the Austrian Emperor obliged to accept the terms imposed by his merciful and macnanimous conqueror. 1810. The days of Wilkes Sir Francis' days renew, And peaceful citizens his conduct rue; Blood stains our streets, and British subjects die Victims of party pertinacity. Three people were killed and many wounded, in consequence of the tumultuous proceedings which followed the refusal of Sir Francis Burdett to submit to the authority of the British Senate. Assassination in it's direst shape Attacks the King's fifth son; the Duke's escape, By Providence directed, claims our praise; The self-devoted murd'rer ends his days By the same hand which aim'd the felon knife Against his unsuspecting master's life. For more of eulogy our warriors' call, Amboyna, and the isle of Bourbon fall In the isle of Rhe, also, a most gallant action was performed by the boats of the Armide, Cadmus, Monkey, and Daring, under Lieutenant Roberts, who captured and destroyed seventeen vessels. Many other brilliant exploits likewise signalized our marine. To British conquerors;—Busaco's field, And Massena's retreat fresh laurels yield. Amelia, youngest of our royal fair, Releas'd from sublunary pain and care; Leaves, inconsolable, the best of sires, Whose fortitude beneath the blow expires: And hence the present source of England's grief, And hence our sad despair of wish'd relief. In mournful absence of the regal mind, 1811. The cares of state are to the Prince consign'd; The Prince accepts, in hopes a year may bring Joy to himself, to us, and to our King; The year elaps'd, our hopes alone remain, And still suspended is our father's reign, 'Tis our's to bend, whatever Heav'n decrees, And Heav'n, which far above our wishes sees, Will, (let us with due resignation trust,) For England's good dispose,—submit we must. The Regent in his delegated power Confirm'd, remains; and may his ev'ry hour Of government on British hearts improve, And gain, with England's duty, England's love. We've said that Massena retreated; We've told you Victor was defeated By Graham, At the battle of Busaco.—a new laurel leaf Almeida Massena repulsed by Lord Wellington. yields the British chief; Scarce ten days more, and Beresford obtains A glorious day on Albuera's plains. General Beresford defeated Marshal Soult. There happen'd too, the self-same day, May 16th, 1811. (Much we regret 'tis our's to say), An action, which will long be felt, 'Twixt President and little Belt. May mutual kind consideration Find influence with either nation, And strife between us be no other Than which is truest friend and brother. Barry, at sea, the French annoys, A fort and three “tall ships destroys.” Off the Coast of Corsica. The Barham, a stout British sev'nty-four, Founders near Corsica; to England's flag Batavia falls. The French settlement of Batavia surrendered to General Sir Samuel Auchmuty, and Rear Admiral Stopford.—A comet's brilliant track Illumes the air, “importing change of times;” The Spanish war a various fortune proves; 1812. “Bellona's bridegroom” bravely stems the tide Of each event, and turns it to success. Cuidad Rodrigo to the leader's name A title adds, nor less of fame Badajoz to his martial genius owes: While at Almarez, on Iberia's foes, Hill points Britannia's thunder.—Sad disgrace Blends with domestic story,—time nor place Protects from murder's unexampled deed, At once the parent, wife, and infant bleed. The tragedies of Marrs, Williamsons, &amp;c. &amp;c, The solemn senate no asylum yields, Nor Perceval from sanguine fury shields; There, unprotected by the sacred walls, Assassination's virtuous victim falls. From tristful subjects turn the tearful eye, To, once more, Wellington and victory! Before his better genius Marmont flies, At the glorious battle of Salamanca. And Paris journals teem, of course, with lies. To conquer Russia Bonaparte assumes, And his high full-fledg'd eagle moults her plumes, Flies back quite stripp'd of each victorious feather, All which, France says, is owing—to the weather. If true effects and causes you'd explore, The Petersburgh gazette will tell you more. Reader, while thus we've trudg'd together, Through ups and downs, in various weather; I've tried, with small success I fear, The unembellished path to cheer. I've painted Aborigines Worse than they did their arms and knees; Of Roman Chiefs, and Saxon wiles, I've sung in hope to gain your smiles. Of kingdoms and what monarchs kept them, 'Till Egbert join'd in uno septem; Of Ethelwulph, and good Saint Austin, Who love and politics were lost in; Of Ethelbert and Ethelbald, Which two were but one sov'reign call'd. Of Ethelred, and, (England's pride,) He who the minstrels calling tried; Anticipation wont be long, To guess that Alfred gilds the song; The song which next essay'd to sing Of Elder Edward, and the King. Athelstan who, or mem'ry fails, Fought much in Ireland and in Wales; And pious Edmund basely slain, By Leolf; then came Edred's reign, When England triumph'd o'er the Dane. Speaking of Edwy we lamented, That he by Dunstan was tormented; Edgar was mention'd more at large, Rowed by eight princes in a barge. Of Martyr'd Edward's tale we boast, Because it introduced a ghost: (In modern day no work of merit Can otherwise go off with spirit.) For Second Ethelred you felt, When forced to pay (that bore) Danegelt; We might have brought ye next a Swain, But his can scarce be call'd a reign. Canute and Ethelred again, Not long your notice cou'd obtain, Before came Edmund Ironside, He and Canute the land divide. I think we named among the worst Of sov'reigns, Harold, styled the first; Saint Edward, who abhorr'd the Devil, Destroy'd Danegelt and cured the evil; O'er hapless Harold's fate I wept, While you, perhaps, my readers, slept; Which I presume in turn to do While singing Norman Bill's curfew. Next, fancy, in new forest walking, Of Redhair'd William sets us talking; Harry the First, I think, we found, Died worth a hundred thousand pound; His daughter Maude and nephew Stephen Found things at odds, which death made even. (If not, we somewhere have misreckon'd,) And enter Harry named the Second; Fair Rosamond we here must pass, Although a most delightful lass; And give a glance of recollection, To Cœur de Lion, whose protection Aided so much the martial cross, It caused John Bull no little loss. Now Arthur's woes, (by uncle John Most villainously put upon); We sadly sung, and still more grave, Told ye some stories of a cave, (As deep as Tunnel bored at Highgate,) Cut underneath the town of Reigate; Where Magna Charta darkly plotted, Was there, as since, of course much blotted. Then you some trivial matters heard About King Henry the third; Edward, who caus'd his foes great losses, And for his wife built many crosses; Gave to the Welch their native prince, Edward the Second;—you were since Inform'd this Second Edward fell, And a Third Edward bore the bell, Who with his Sable Son o'ercame All co-mates in the road of fame. With pens impartial we disclosed How Second Richard was deposed; Doom'd to see all his hopes miscarry, In favour of our Fourth King Harry. The Muse's task wou'd ne'er be done, (Talking of that King Harry's son,) If she again to tell wou'd deign The glory of Fifth Harry's reign; Enough for her with tears to wail O'er Sixth King Henry's mournful tale. We sung of Edward, (number four,) And his penchant for Mistress Shore; We shudder'd at the fiend who slew Fifth Edward and his brother.—Do Admit, dear reader, that our pen Murder'd—the story—o'er again. If at Third Richard we have storm'd, Our lines were, like the man, deform'd; And then we own'd no strains were ruder Than those which told of Harry Tudor. Eighth Harry's reign includes the lives Of Wolsey and his master's wives; Sixth Edward and his early worth, And Mary's much lamented birth, Succeeded are by feeble lays Which aim'd to sing Eliza's praise. On James the First we spent some breath, And sigh'd, indignant, o'er the death Of murder'd Charles;—wish'd Butler's pen To lash the puritannic den Of thieves, with Cromwell and his crew Who, Judas like, their master slew. You'll find some few convivial lays To picture Charles the Second's days: Of Second James the Muse has rated The theme so low—she abdicated. Some giddy joy the Bard may plead, While celebrating Runnimede; The Bill of Rights, and England's law Restored by Mary and Nassau. Perhaps with too much haste we ran O'er Marlb'ro's deeds, and good Queen Anne; When Brunswick coming to our aid, A most delightful finish made; Or, “rather,” says some critical effusion! “Made a most lame and impotent conclusion.” Reader, adieu, confess my task May somewhat of indulgence ask; And since no fable aids the Muse, Who may not here her subjects chuse, But rough or smooth, plain truths rehearse, Whether or no they suit her verse: Your better humour will supply My wishes, where the stream ran dry, And Pegasus forgot to fly. Adieu! for dulness pardon me, And yawning I'll forgive in thee. FINIS.</field>
