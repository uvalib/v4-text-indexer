THE PETITION OF AN OLD UNINHABITED HOUSE IN PENZANCE. Thus, Sir, you have brought an Old House about your ears. Parl. Deb. Merito celebratur in Digressionibus Pindari felix audacia. Lowth de Poes.

Part of Stonehenge has fallen, since Dr. Stukely's last description of it; and Athens is by no means in the state in which it was when described by Wheeler and Wood. Such must be the consequences attending all “Writings on ruins.” Etiam periere ruinæ. a rotten row Cry out, “Take care,” to all below; Nay, sparrows, with admonitory pecks, Warn off their young ones, lest they break their necks. My mould'ring walls in many a hideous chasm Require some healing Mason's cataplasm:— From side to side, so crack'd my ruins are, That, if you will not grant them some repair, Pray, on each gap inscribe, “This is no Thorough-fare.” The Passengers, who daily pass, Peep through my broken panes of glass, But cobwebs with a friendly veil My inward solitudes conceal. Alas! Arachne, tho' no sweeping broom Brush down the labors of thy loom; Where there's no sugar, cream, nor pie, To lure the scent of wand'ring fly, Thou'rt doom'd a slower death to meet, And thine own Web's thy winding-sheet: Thy tap'stry dark, which clouds my shatter'd panes, Waving, like banners, o'er thy starv'd remains. My Scraper's gone, for none my threshold needs; My Steps are strewn with emblematic weeds; To thund'ring knocker, and to tinkling bell, My moveless Door has bid a long farewell; For who would knock, or who would ring the bell, To hear the hollow echoes sadly tell, “There's nobody at home:—'tis Desolation's cell!” Once the firm Guardian of the racy wines Against the wall my Cellar-door reclines Unlock'd, unhing'd; while thro' the dark profound The empty Pipe emits a mournful sound. Of cork-less Carcases a dreary row Moulder in catacombs, that gape below,— Sons of the social hour, shed sorrows here! If e'er ye wept, weep o'er the Bottled Bier. I the Author do positively assert that “Bier” is the right word. If empty bottles are called “dead men,” surely it is not too bold a metaphor to style the shelf, which supports them, a Bottled Bier. If I had not made this positive declaration in my lifetime, it is pleasant to imagine what would have been the conjectural emendations of those learned, but yet unborn Doctors A. B. C. D. &amp;c. if my Epistle should have been found in the corner of an old chest some centuries hence. “Bottled Bier.” A mere mistake of the printer: for “Bier, read Beer.” Bottled Beer was a common article in the cellars of Gentlemen in the 19th century. Dr. A. The reading proposed by Dr. A. is certainly right; Bottled Beer, or Porter, was not only a common beverage in those days, but it was an article of exportation; as appears by the Registers of the Custom-house, which by the kind permission of those patrons of Literature, the Lords of the Treasury, I have been permitted to search. It is strange how “Bier” should be found in three editions! Dr. B. I agree with Dr. A. and Dr. B. in their happy emendation of the text. Had they attended to the Association of Ideas, they would not have been at a loss to trace the origin of the error. The words “carcases” and “catacombs” occur in the preceding lines, and the Editor's mistake of Bier for Beer was natural: it is evidently not a mistake of the printer. Dr. C. I am at all times willing to pay every respect to the acuteness of a Dr. A. the sagacity of a Dr. B. and the profundity of a Dr. C. but as Bier is the reading of every edition, three of which were published in the Author's lifetime, I must think that it is right, and that Bier was the name of some liquor then in vogue, though now unknown. I am informed that upon digging near the spot, where the Old House stood, a bottle has lately been found with wires twisted over the neck of it: no doubt with an intention to confine the cork, and perhaps the “Bier” (for I never can consent to think it was “Beer”) was contained in such bottles. Dr. D. Dr. D. is certainly correct. I have seen the bottle; it has an E. upon it, the initial of the owner of the house, and is now in the British Museum. The cork was not quite destroyed, and a little liquid was still remaining in the bottle. That never to be sufficiently admired Chemist Dr. G. is engaged in analysing it, and there can be little doubt of his discovering what were the ingredients of that (now unknown) liquor called “Bier.” Dr. F. Oh! Shakespear, Brother Bard, if thou hadst used my precaution, Thou wouldst not so have suffered by Commentators!— Why starts my Muse? why trembling turns her head?

With inward moan and secret tears I've wailed my fate for many years, But now, how strangely chang'd the case is! My neighbours all have wash'd their faces: The stone fronts of many houses have been merely scrubbed with soap and water, and the cleanliness and freshness of appearance, which it has given them, is truly surprising. Stead of mortar, brick, and trowel, Using soap, and brush, and towel; And so flaunt away, and flare it, That really, Sir, I cannot bear it. If Penzance, like Bodmin Town, A learned Judge on the circuit observed to the Mayor of Bodmin, that the whole town appeared to have been built at one time. Why do you think so? said the Mayor: because it is all tumbling down together, replied the Judge. Look'd like one great Tumble-down, Where the buildings, “one and all,” Bend in sympathetic fall; In such a fellowship of grief My sorrow might find some relief: But now, from Back to Betty's Lane, From Morrop stile to Ponsendane; From north to south, from east to west, Where Jennies spin, or Hides are drest; Elliott's Square, and Will Toll's Bakehouse, Humphry's Shop, In an attack made by the Spaniards in 1595 on the Inhabitants of Penzance, a Constable (vide Carew) was knocked down.

Our Shoot appears the most pure: The fountain of Blandusia was “splendidior vitreo,” and it was a place of great chit-chat for the young women who filled their pitchers at it;—hence the beauty of the expression— Loquaces Lymphæ desiliunt tuæ: but the cattle of the neighbourhood were invited to its brink ?tu frigus amabile Fessis vomero tauris Prœbes, et pecori vago. Not so at the Shoot of Penzance; as may be seen by perusing “impositam ilicem” i.e. the Board which is fixed against the Wall. Nothing, that can pollute, shall touch our pure stream!

Sicut apud Ægyptiacos Leo et Virgo unum animal formant, quod Sphinx nominatur, sic apud Penzantienses Kitty et Ben, uxor et maritus, uno nomine designantur, et unico splendore nitent. Roscrow. Hail! Kitty, hail! While Hacks are handy, and while Soap can clean, Penzance thy praise shall sing; Of Grooms—Thy Spouse the King; Of Starchers—Thou the Queen. If immortality my verse could give, Thy little Dog should aye for ages live; Sweet quadruped! whose flea-less flaxen hairs Proclaim the combings of thy cleanly cares. But to quit the mazy road Of wildly devious Episode, So in the web of Epic Song sublime The bard Mæonian interweaves the charm Of gentle Episode, yet leaves unbroke The golden thread of his majestic theme. Mason. Eng. Gard. Which leads astray, and makes a man turn Out of his way, like Jack o'lantern, And to proceed— Old Market-house, that look'd so grim, Is now a Beau, quite spruce and trim: The Baptist's head The arms of the town, sculptured over the market-house door by Mr. Isabel, of Truro. Penzance means Holy Head, i.e. Holy Headland, and it was so called because on the projecting point near the present quay there was a Chapel dedicated to St. Anthony. When it was necessary to adopt Arms for the Town, the real meaning was forgotten, and the Holy Head of St.John adopted. in profile larger, Spreads o'er the margin of the Charger, Et marmore ostendit duro, How great a Phidias lives at Truro. In cupola with arches Grecian, And greenly splendid blinds Venetian, A Clock—far truer than the sun— Tells market-folks how minutes run. The Vane above with glittering glare “Streams like a meteor to the troubled air.” Our Ball-room too has few compeers: See, see, those blazing Chandeliers! What Music! ravishing the spheres! And ah! what pretty little Houris, Whose charms are more than ample dowries, Lightly thread the mazy dance! —Say, say, ye Gods, is this Penzance? Yes, Master, yes, and more my Muse could tell Of Justice Dinners at the Grand Hotel; Of crouded News-rooms, where in stern debate Some stir the nation up, and some the grate; The spirit of reform is never more troublesome, than when it has a pyrotechnical turn. Furor arma ministrat. The fire-reformer seizes the poker, and chokes those, who were previously comfortable, (tho' in a news-room, as in the world, all cannot have front seats near the fire,) with dust, and smoke, and ashes. Of Gents' and Ladies' Book-clubs, Promenades, Of Concerts, Picnics, Hum-drums, Routs, and Cards: But what have I with them to do? Houses warm, they're made for you. Once on a time I had my heyday; But now from Michaelmas to May-day I hear no Music, see no Lady, Nor know what 'tis to have a gay day. Oh! then, my ever honor'd Master, Have pity on my sad disaster, And call for mortar, brick, and plaister. No more I'll moan, no more I'll fret, If once I see in our Gazette Your House in Alvern Street “To Let.” Gentle Reader If you think Poetic diction Adopts the sauce piquant of fiction, And that Penzance with all its gaieties Is not so splendid as I say it is, Peruse some prose-hints This Letter appeared in the Cornwall Gazette, November 15th, 1803. to that droll man The comic Writer, Mr. Colman. APPENDIX. LINES ADDRESSED TO AN OLD PLEASURE HOUSE. And thou wert built with promise fair Of many a happy day; And breathings sweet of balmy air, And fields in liv'ry gay, And murmurings of rippling streams, And buds and blossoms filling Accorded to the lightsome dreams, With which the heart was thrilling, That rear'd thy roof.—But where are fled The joys in fancy's eye? Wild moss along thy path is spread, And ruins moulder nigh. Oh! let not from thy weed-clad cell One leaf removed be; Where Melancholy's wont to dwell, Is Pleasure's house to me. A DUET Written for Mr. Randles, and his amiable little Daughter the Musical Prodigy; whose abilities were her Father's support. She exhibited her talents at Penzance, June 5th, 1807. DAUGHTER. Say, Father, why the trickling tears Fall fast adown thy cheek; O! ease a daughter's trembling fears, And all thy sorrows speak. What tho' the orb, that gilds the sky, Be hidden from thy sight, Thy daughter and thy Page am I To guide thee thro' thy night.FATHER. My tears are not the tears of woe; I know no bosom grief; In gushing transport forth they flow, Rapt ecstacy's relief: Thy angel-skill and angel-love, Boons for my blindness given, Awake my thoughts to realms above, And make my darkness Heaven. LINES Written for a Fete at Penzance, given in celebration of the Princess Charlotte's Birthday, A.D. 1814. In choral bands, ye festive throng, Weave the gay dance, and raise the song, Fill high the circulating glass, And bid the “electric ruby” pass!— Hush'd is each boding fear of ill, The anxious sigh of Care is still; Present is the promised pleasure, Circling Suns have filled their measure, And blest is Albion in the happy hour, Which marks the blooming of Her fairest Flower. Hail the Day! a date of glory! Hail the Maid, whose future story Shall rival great Eliza's name, And mingle with an Anna's fame. The diadem's imperial rays, The emerald's green, and sapphire's blaze Are wont with purer light to glow, When radiant from a Woman's brow; The dove-wing'd Sceptre claims an holier sway, And proud Submission triumphs to obey. For, waiting Beauty's soft command, Love, Awe, and Admiration stand; Sweet influence the Graces shower, And Virtue owns a Sister Power; While Chivalry his gauntlet throws In challenge vain for inmate foes, And calls on Peace with sweet employ Thro' cottaged vales to tune her joy; Or, if the foreign trump of War he hear, Uplifts his shield, and points his guardian spear. So bright, O Charlotte, are the views, Which burst on the prophetic Muse.— Windsor, thy forest's mighty shade Shall ne'er embower so fair a Maid, Until—(and every Briton's prayer Breathes wishes for the future Pair) Until of Her high-dower'd love United bliss the union prove, And give th' admiring world renewed to see Our Charlotte's virtues in Her progeny. INSCRIPTION FOR LANYON CROMLECH IN ITS FALLEN STATE. This fine Cromlech, perhaps the noblest specimen of the kind, fell down in the night of October the 19th, 1816, when the Delhi was wrecked in the tremendous storm near Saint Michael's Mount. And Thou at last art fall'n: Thou, who hast seen The storms and calms of twice ten hundred years. The naked Briton here has paused to gaze Upon thy pond'rous mass, ere bells were chimed, Or the throng'd hamlet smok'd with social fires. Whilst thou hast here repos'd, what numerous tribes, That breath'd the breath of life, have pass'd away.— What wond'rous changes in th' affairs of men! Their proudest cities lowly ruins made; Battles, and sieges, empires lost and won; Whilst thou hast stood upon the silent hill A lonely monument of times that were.— Lie, where thou art. Let no rude hand remove, Or spoil thee; for the spot is consecrate To thee, and Thou to it: and as the heart Aching with thoughts of human littleness Asks, without hope of knowing, whose the strength That poised thee here; so ages yet unborn (O! humbling, humbling thought!) may vainly seek, What were the race of men, that saw thee fall. SONNET ON CUTTING DOWN AN OLD ARBOUR. With desolating stroke the woodman's blade Hath hewn thy bough-wove arches to the ground: No more within the chequers of thy shade The warblings of the nestled thrush resound. No more from sultry noon shall here retire Friendship and home-nurs'd Love, in union sweet, To Summer's change for Winter's social fire, The quiet converse of thy hush'd retreat.— Thy joys are strewn like scatter'd leaves; away They're swept from light and memory; and they, Who o'er thy fate in sad repining stand, As those who erst enjoy'd thy shade,—shall all Like thy torn shatter'd branches with'ring fall Beneath the scythe of Time's unsparing hand. WOODCOCK SHOOTING: Composed at intervals between the Shots on a Shooting Party, at Trye in Gulval, Oct. 21st, 1817. Pale was the moon and radiant was the star In the clear forehead of the morning sky; Elate of heart we mount the rapid car To bear our thunders to the groves of Trye. A thousand varied tints adorn the trees, Beneath the brakes the rills run babbling by, The branches gently rustle to the breeze, Bright bursts the Sun, and all is harmony. With mark! mark! mark! the echoing valley rings, From hill to hill the Marker shrilly calls; On winnowing wing the hunted Woodcock springs; The tube is levell'd, and the victim falls. Another, and another springs, and dies. The busy spaniel is the sportsman's clue: The Marker halloos, and the gun replies: The game is flush'd, and Health and Joy pursue. Onward we follow. Onward still, and on: Nor wood, nor mountain stop our eager way: 'Twas darkness ere we knew the morn was gone. —This was a Holiday. SONNET (Written November, 1814,) TO AN OLD NEWS ROOM AT PENZANCE, Established A.D. 1799. Hail to thy walls, Old Room.-While through the world The Demon of destruction has unfurled His bloody banners, 'mid the death-fraught storm Shelter'd in thy recess, secure and warm, Three lustres we have pass'd; and here have known No other grief, and heard no other moan Than tales of mourning move. The scene is o'er;— And He, chief Actor in the deeds of blood, a poor Self-banish'd Exile. As in the Scenic glass We, safe Spectators, saw the Drama pass,— The curtain fall.—And what doth Time prepare? Calm halcyon days, or shall the wild waves beat With renovated rage?—Whatever share Of Life be ours, be ours the same Retreat. AN ORIGINAL MEMBER. At the Hotel near the Land's End the Landlord had provided a Book intended as an Album, and had placed the following address to his Guests in a conspicuous part of his Dining Room.—We have selected one specimen from the many which are inserted, some of them very pleasing: but sorry are we to relate that the Book has been woefully abused, and is any thing but an Album. Hunc tu Romane caveto Hic niger est. A new Book is provided, Editio purgata in usum Musarum, with the following locally appropriate motto “husteron proteron” for a translation of which Ecce Signum!— THE LANDLORD'S ADDRESS TO HIS GUESTS, AT THE LAND'S END HOTEL. Ladies and Gents I do intreat, While here you're met to drink and eat, And while the kettle's boiling, My windows, ceiling, and my walls With pencil markings and with scrawls That you will not be spoiling. The name of hero, beau, or lass, If written on the brittle glass May in a moment vanish; And from the ceiling of my room Dame Lethe with her white-wash broom May very quickly banish. For immortality a nook The pages of this little book Present you in a minute; Then to the first and last Hotel Before your first and last farewell Pray write your names within it. SONNET (Written in the Album, Oct. 25th, 1819), TO VISITORS AT THE LAND'S END. Stranger! when on the promontory's brow Of old Bolerium o'er the surge below You muse with dizzy gaze; and, when again You turn to mingle in the haunts of men, What are your thoughts? Amid the mighty scene Of Nature's temple are they hushed, serene, Soothed to a sabbath stilness? Or, while play The gentle Zephyrs on their softest wing, With ladies fair and blithe companions gay Do you indulge in mirth and revelling? Pause on your Country's bourn: and, as a day So won from other yet revolving years May ne'er return, or marked by smiles or tears Embalm it here by some poetic lay.</field>
