      <field name="fulltext">Thoughts in Prison. COMMENCED SUNDAY EVENING, Eight o'Clock, The hour when they lock up in this dismal place. February 23, 1777. WEEK THE FIRST. The Imprisonment. My friends are gone! Harsh on its sullen hinge Grates the dread door: the massy bolts respond Tremendous to the surly keeper's touch. The dire keys clang, with movement dull and slow While their behest the ponderous locks perform: And fastened firm, the object of their care Is left to solitude,—to sorrow left! But wherefore fastened? Oh still stronger bonds Than bolts, or locks, or doors of molten brass, To solitude and sorrow would consign His anguish'd soul, and prison him, tho' free! For, whither should he fly, or where produce In open day, and to the golden sun, His hapless head! whence every laurel torn, On his bald brow sits grinning Infamy; And all in sportive triumph twines around The keen, the stinging adders of disgrace! Yet what's disgrace with man? or all the stings Of pointed scorn? What the tumultuous voice Of erring multitudes? Or what the shafts Of keenest malice, levell'd from the bow Of human inquisition?—if the God, Who knows the heart, looks with complacence down Upon the struggling victim, and beholds Repentance bursting from the earth-bent eye, And faith's red cross held closely to the breast! Oh Author of my being! of my bliss Beneficent Dispenser! wondrous power, Whose eye, all-searching thro' this dreary gloom Discerns the deepest secrets of the soul, Assist me! With thy ray of light divine Illumine my dark thoughts; upraise my low; And give me wisdom's guidance, while I strive Impartially to state the dread account, And call myself to trial! Trial far Than that more fearful—tho' how fearful that Which trembling late I proved! Oh aid my hand To hold the balance equal, and allow The few sad moments of remaining life To retrospection useful! make my end, As my first wish (thou know'st the heart) has been, To make my whole of being to my friends, My fellow-pilgrims thro' this world of woe, Instructive!—Oh could I conduct but one, One only with me, to our Canaan's rest, How could I meet my fate, nor think it hard! Not think it hard?—Burst into tears, my soul; Gush every pore of my distracted frame, Gush into drops of blood!—But one; save one, Or guide to Canaan's rest?—when all thy views In better days were dedicate alone To guide, persuade to that celestial rest, Souls which have listened with devotion's ear To Sion's songs enchanting from thy lips, And tidings sweet of Jesu's pardoning love! But one, save one?—Oh, what a rest is this! Oh what a Sabbath in this dungeon's gloom, This prison-house, meet emblem of the realm Reserv'd for the ungodly! Hark, methinks I hear the cheerful melody of praise And penitential sweetness Referring more immediately to the duty of the Magdalen-Chapel.! 'Tis the sound, The well-known sound, to which my soul, attun'd For year succeeding year, hath hearken'd glad, And still with fresh delight: while all my powers In blest employ have prest the saving truths Of grace divine, and faith's all-conquering might, On the sure Rock of Ages grounded firm. Those hours are gone! and here, from heaven shut out, And heavenly works like these, on this lov'd day, Rest of my God,—I only hear around The dismal clang of chains; the hoarse rough shout Of dissonant imprecation; and the cry Of misery and vice, in fearful din Impetuous mingled; while my frighted mind Shrinks back in horror! while the scalding tears Involuntary starting, furrow down My sickly cheeks; and whirling thought confus'd For giddy moments, scarce allows to know Or where, or who, or what a wretch I am! Not know?—Alas! too well it strikes my heart, Emphatical it speaks! while dungeons, chains, And bars and bolts proclaim the mournful truth, “Ah what a wretch thou art! how sunk, how fall'n, “ Milton's Par. Lost, B. 5. p. 510.From what high state of bliss, into what woe!” Fall'n from the topmost bough that plays in air E'en of the tallest cedar; where aloft Proud happiness her towering eyrie built; Built, as I dreamt, for ages. Idle dream! And yet, amongst the millions of mankind, Who sleep like me, how few, like me deceiv'd, Do not indulge the same fantastic dream! Give me the angel's clarion!—Let me sound, Loud as the blast which shall awake the dead; Oh let me sound, and call the slumberers forth To view the vision which delusion charms; To shake the potent incantation off; Or ere it burst in ruin on their souls, As it has burst on mine.—Not on my soul! Retract the dread idea: Righteous God! Not on my soul! Oh Thou art gracious all, And with an eye of pity from thy throne Of Majesty supernal, thou behold'st The creatures of thy hand, thy feeble sons, Struggling with sin, with Satan, and the world, Their sworn and deadly foes: and, having felt In human flesh the trials of our kind, Know'st sympathetic how to aid the tried! Rock of my hope! the rash, rash phrase forgive; Safe is my soul; nor can it know one fear, Grounded on Thee Unchangeable! Thee first, Thee last, great Cleanser of all human sin! But, tho' secure the vessel rides in port, Held firm by faith's strong anchor,—well it suits The mariner to think by what strange means Thro' perils unconceivable he pass'd; Thro' rocks, sands, pirates, storms, and boisterous waves, And happily obtain'd that port at last. On these my thoughts are bent: nor deem it wrong, Minist'ring angels! whose benignant task Assign'd by Heav'n, is to console distress, And hold up human hearts amidst the toil Of human woe See Psalm xxxiv. 7. Heb. i. 14.!—Blest spirits, who delight In sweet, submissive resignation's smile, To that high will you know for ever right;— Deem it not wrong, that with a weeping eye, Deem it not wrong, that with a bleeding heart, I dwell a while, unworthiest of my race, On those black rocks, those quick-sands, waves and storms, Which in a sea of trouble have engulph'd All, all my earthly comforts; and have left Me, a poor naked, shipwreck'd, suffering wretch On this bleak shore, in this confinment drear; At sight of which, in better days, my soul Hath started back with horror! while my friend, My bosom-partner in each hour of pain, With antidotes preventive kindly arm'd, Trembling for my lov'd health; when christian calls And zeal for others welfare, haply brought My steps attendant on this den of death! Oh dismal change! Now, not in friendly sort A christian visitor, to pour the balm Of christian comfort in some wretch's ear,— I am that wretch myself! and want, much want, The christian consolation I bestow'd; So cheerfully bestow'd! want, want, my God, From Thee the mercy, from my fellow-man The lenient mercy, which, great Judge of hearts, To Thee I make the solemn, sad appeal— That mercy, which Thou knowest my gladsome soul Ever sprang forth with transport to impart! Why then, mysterious providence! pursued With such unfeeling ardour? why pursued To death's dread bourn, by men to me unknown! Why—Stop the deep question; it o'erwhelms my soul; It reels, it staggers!—Earth turns round!—my brain Whirls in confusion! my impetuous heart Throbs with pulsations not to be restrain'd: Why?—where?—Oh Chesterfield! my son, my son! Nay, talk not of composure! I had thought In olden time, that my weak heart was soft, And pity's self might break it.—I had thought That marble-eyed severity would crack The slender nerves which guide my reins of sense, And give me up to madness. 'Tis not so: My heart is callous, and my nerves are tough: It will not break! they will not crack; or else What more, just Heaven, was wanting to the deed, Than to behold—Oh that eternal night Had in that moment screen'd me from myself!— My Stanhope to behold, whose filial ear Drank pleas'd the lore of wisdom from my tongue. My Stanhope to behold!—Ah piercing sight! Forget it;—'tis distraction:—Speak who can! But I am lost! a criminal adjudg'd! A guilty miscreant! Canst thou think, my friend, Oh Butler,—'midst a million faithful found!— Oh canst thou think, who know'st, who long hast known My inmost soul; oh canst thou think that life, From such rude outrage for a moment sav'd, And sav'd almost by a miracle Referring to the case reserved for the solemn decision of the twelve judges; and which gave the prisoner a much longer space than his most sanguine friends could have expected, from the complexion of the process. See the Sessions Paper for Feb. 1777., deserves The languid wish, or e'er can be sustain'd? It can—it must! That miracle alone To life gives consequence. Oh deem it not Presumptuous, that my grateful soul thus rates The present high deliverance it hath found;— Sole effort of thy wisdom, Sovereign Power, Without whose knowledge not a sparrow falls! Oh may I cease to live, ere cease to bless That interposing hand, which turn'd aside,— Nay to my life and preservation turn'd The fatal blow precipitate, ordain'd To level all my little hopes in dust, And give me to the grave! Rather, my hand, Forget thy cunning! Rather shall my tongue In gloomy silence bury every note To my glad heart respondent, than I cease To dedicate to Him who spar'd my life, Each breath, each power, while He vouchsafes to lend The precious boon!—To Him be all its praise! To Him be all its service! Long or short, The gift's the same: to live or die to him Is gain sufficient, everlasting gain: And may that gain be mine!—I live, I live! Ye hours, ye minutes, bounty of his grace, Fleet not away without improvement due: Rich on your wings bear penitence and prayer To Heaven's all-clement Ruler; and to man Bear all the retribution man can make! Ye precious hours, ye moments snatch'd from death, Replete with incense rise,—that my cheer'd soul, When comes the solemn call, may spring away, Delighted, to the bosom of its God! Who shall condemn the trust?—proud rationals (That deep in speculation's 'wildering maze Bemuse themselves with error, and confound The laws of men, of nature, and of Heaven) Presumptuous in their wisdom, dare dethrone Even from his works the Maker: and contend, That He who form'd it governs not the world: While, steep'd in sense's Lethe, sons of earth From the world's partial picture gaily draw Their mad conclusions. Bold broad-staring vice, Lull'd on the lap of every mundane bliss, At meek-eyed virtue's patient suffering scoffs, And dares with dauntless insolence the God, Regardless of his votaries!—Vain and blind! Alike thro' wisdom or thro' folly blind— Whose dim contracted view the petty round, The mere horizon of the present hour In darkness terminates! Oh could I hope The golden portals of eternal day; Pour on your sight the congregated blaze Of light, of wisdom, bursting from the throne Of universal glory; on the round, The boundless cycle of His moral plan, Who, hid in clouds terrific, Master sits Of subject men and worlds; and sees at once The ample scene of present, future, past, All naked to his eye of flame:—all rang'd In harmony complete, to work his will, And finish with the plaudit of the skies! But,—while this whelming blazon may not burst On the weak eyes of mortals; while confin'd Thro' dark dim glass, with dark dim sight to look All trembling to the future, and collect The scatter'd rays of wisdom; while referr'd Our infant reason to the guiding hand Of faith strong-eyed, which never quits the view Of Jesus, her great pole-star; from whose word, Irradiate with the lustre of his love, She learns the mighty Master to explore In all his works; and from the meanest taught Beholds the God, the Father,—Scorn ye not, My fellow-pilgrims, fellow-heirs of death, And, oh triumphant thought!—my fellow-heirs Of life immortal;—if not sold to sense And infidelity's black cause, you cast Ungracious from yourselves the proferr'd boon: —Then scorn not, oh my friends, when Heaven vouchafes To teach by meanest objects, reptiles, birds, —To take one lesson from a worm, like me! Proof of a gracious providence I live;— To Him be all the glory! Of his care Paternal, his supporting signal love, I live each hour an argument. Away, The systematic dullness of dispute! Away, each doating reasoner!—I feel, Feel in my inmost heart the conscious sense, The grateful pressure of distinguish'd grace, And live, and only wish for life to praise it! For say, my soul,—nor midst this silence sad, This midnight, awful, melancholy gloom, Nor in this solemn moment of account 'Twixt thee and Heaven,—when on his altar lies A sacrifice thy naked bleeding heart! Say, nor, self-flattering, to thy conscience hold The mirror of deceit;—couldst thou have thought Thy nerves, thy head, thy heart, thy frame, thy sense, Sufficient to sustain the sudden shock, Rude as a bursting earthquake, which at once Toppled the happy edifice adown, Whelm'd thee and thine beneath its ruinous crash, And buried all in sorrow?—Torn away Impetuous from thy home, thy much-lov'd home, Without one moment to reflection giv'n! By soothing, solemn promise led to place Ingenuous all thy confidence of life In men, assuming gentle pity's guise! Vain confidence in aught beneath the sun! Behold the hour, the dreadful hour arriv'd: The prison opes its ruthless gates upon thee! Oh Horror! But what's this, this fresh attack! 'Tis she, 'tis she! my weeping, fainting wife! “And hast thou faithful found me? Has thy love “Thus burst thro' ev'ry barrier? Hast thou trac'd “—Deprest in health, and timid as thou art— “At midnight trac'd the desolate wild streets; “Thus in a prison's gloom to throw thy arms “Of conjugal endearment round the neck “Of thy lost husband?—Fate, exact thy worst; “The bitterness is past.”—Idea vain! To tenfold bitterness drench'd in my deep cup Of gall the morning rises! Statue like, Inanimate, half dead, and fainting half, To stand a spectacle!—the præter stern Denying to my pleading tears one pang Of human sympathy! Conducted forth, Amidst th'unfeeling populace; pursued Like some deer, which from the hunter's aim Hath ta'en its deadly hurt; and glad to find— Panting with woe,—my refuge in a gaol! Can misery stretch more tight the torturing cord? But hence this softness! Wherefore thus lament These petty, poor escutcheons of thy fate, When lies—all worthy of thyself and life, Cold in the hearse of ruin?—Rather turn Grateful thine eyes, and raise, tho' red with tears, To his high throne, who looks on thy distress With fatherly compassion; kindly throws Sweet comfort's mixture in thy cup, and soothes With Gilead's balm thy death-wound. He it is Who, 'midst the shock disrupting, holds in health Thy shatter'd frame, and keeps thy reason clear; He, He it is, whose pitying powers supports Thy humbled soul, deep humbled in the dust, Beneath the sense of guilt; the mournful sense Of deep transgression 'gainst thy fellow-men, Of sad offence 'gainst Him, thy Father-God; Who, lavish in his bounties, woo'd thy heart With each paternal blessing;—ah ingrate, And worthless! Yet—(His mercies who can count, Or truly speak his praise!)—Yet thro' this gloom Of self-conviction, lowly He vouchafes To dart a ray of comfort, like the Sun's, All-cheering thro' a summer's evening shower! Arch'd in his gorgeous sky, I view the Bow, Of grace fix'd emblem! 'Tis that grace alone Which gives my soul its firmness; builds my hope Beyond the grave; and bids me spurn the earth! First of all blessings, hail! Yet Thou, from whom Both first and last, both great and small proceed; Exhaustless source of every good to man, Accept for all, the tribute of my praise; For all are thine!—Thine the ingenuous friends, Who solace with compassion sweet my woe; Mingle with mine their sympathetic tears; Incessant and disinterested toil To work my weal; and, delicately kind, Watch every keener sensibility That lives about my soul. Oh, more than friends, In tenderness my children!—Thine are too The very keepers of the rugged jail, —Ill school to learn humanity's soft lore!— Yet here humanity their duty pays, Respectably affecting! Whilst they tend My little wants, officious in their zeal, They turn away, and fain would hide the tear That gushes all unbidden to their eye, And sanctifies their service.—On their heads Thy blessing, Lord of Bounty!— —But, of all, All thy choice comforts in this drear distress, God of our first young love! Thine is the Wife, Who with assiduous care, from night to morn, From morn to night, watches my every need; And, as in brightest days of peace and joy, Smiles on my anguish, while her own poor breast Is full almost to bursting! Prostrate, Lord, Before thy footstool—Thou, whose highest style On earth, in heaven, is love!—Thou, who hast breath'd Thro' human hearts the tender charities, The social fond affections which unite In bonds of sweetest amity those hearts, And guide to every good!—Thou, whose kind eye Complacent must behold the rich, ripe fruit, Mature and mellow'd on the generous stock Of thy own careful planting!—Low on earth, And mingled with my native dust, I cry; With all the Husband's anxious fondness cry; With all the friend's solicitude and truth; With all the teacher's fervour,—“God of Love, “Vouchsafe thy choicest comforts on her head! “Be thine my fate's decision: To thy will “With angel-resignation, lo! we bend!” But hark! what sound, wounding the night's dull ear, Bursts sudden on my sense, and makes more horrible These midnight horrors?—'Tis the solemn bell, Alarum to the prisoners of death This alludes to a very striking and awful circumstance. The Bellman of St. Sepulchre's, near the prison, is by long and pious custom appointed to announce at midnight to the condemned criminals in their cells, that the hour of their departure is at hand!!— Hark! what a groan, responsive from the cells Of condemnation, calls upon my heart, My thrilling heart, for intercession strong, And pleadings in the sufferer's behalf— My fellow-sufferers, and my fellow-men! Cease then awhile the strain, my plaintive soul, And veil thy face of sorrow! Lonely hours, Soon will return thee to thy midnight task, For much remains to sing; sad themes, unsung, As deem'd perchance too mournful;—yet, what else Than themes like these can suit a muse like mine! —And might it be, that while ingenuous woe Bleeds thro' my verse; while the succeeding page Weaving with my sad story the detail Of crimes, of punishments, of prisons drear, Of present life and future,—sad discourse And serious shall contain; Oh might it be, That human hearts may listen and improve; O might it be, that benefit to souls Flow from the weeping tablet: tho' the Man In torture die,—the Painter shall rejoice! Sunday, March 2, 1777. END OF THE FIRST WEEK. WEEK THE SECOND. The Retrospect. Oh, not that thou goest hence—sweet drooping flower, Surcharg'd with Sorrow's dew!—Not that thou quitt'st This pent and feverish gloom, which beams with light, With health, with comfort, by thy presence cheer'd, Companion of my life, and of my woes Blest soother! Not that thou goest hence to drink A purer air, and gather from the breath Of balmy spring new succour, to recruit Thy wanning health, and aid thee to sustain, With more than manly fortitude, thy own And my afflictive trials! Not that here, Amidst the glories of this genial day, Immur'd, thro' iron bars I peep at Heaven, With dim, lack-lustre eye!—Oh, 'tis not this That drives the poison'd point of torturous thought Deep to my spring of life! It is not this That prostrate lays me weeping in the dust, And draws in sobs the life-blood from my heart! Well could I bear thy absence: well, full well; Tho' angel-comforts in thy converse smile, And make my dungeon Paradise!—Full well Could I sustain thro' iron bars to view The golden Sun, in bridegroom-majesty Taking benignant nature to his love, And decking her with bounties! Well, very well Could I forego the delicate delight Of tracing nature's germens, as they bud; Of viewing spring's first children, as they rise In innocent sweetness, or beneath the thorn In rural privacy; or on gay parterre More artful, less enchanting!—Well, very well Could I forego to listen,—in this house Of unremitted din,—and nought complain; To listen, as I oft have stood with thee Listening in fond endearment to the voice Of stock-dove, thro' the silence of the wood Hoarse murmuring:—Well, oh could I forego These innocent, tho' exquisite delights, Still new, and to my bosom still attun'd In moral, mental melody!—Sweet Spring! Well could I bear this sad exile from Thee, Nor drop one tear reluctant: for my soul, Strong to superior feelings, soars aloft To eminence of misery!—Confin'd On this bless'd day—the Sabbath of my God! —Not from his House alone, not from the power Of joyful worship with assembling crowds See Psalm lxxxiv., But from the labours once so amply mine, The labours of his love. Now, laid aside, Cover'd my head with ignominious dust, My voice is stopp'd! and, had I e'en the power, Strong shame, and stronger grief would to that voice Forbid all utterance!—Ah, thrice hapless voice, By Heaven's own finger all indulgent tuned To touch the heart, and win th'attentive soul To love of truth divine, how useless now, How dissonant, unstrung!—Like Salem's harps Once fraught with richest harmony of praise, Hung in sad silence by Euphrates' stream, Upon the mournful willows! There they wept, Thy captive people wept, O God!—when thought To bitter memory recall'd the songs, The dulcet songs of Sion! Oh blest songs, Transporting chorus of united hearts, In cheerful music mounting to the praise Of Sion's King of Glory!—Oh the joy Transcendant, of petitions wing'd aloft With fervour irresistible from throngs Asssembled in thy earthly courts, dread King Of all-dependant nature!—looking up For all to Thee, as do the servants eyes Up to their fostering Master! Joy of joys, Amidst such throng'd assemblies to stand forth, To blow the Silver Trumpet of thy Grace; The gladsome year of jubilee to proclaim, And offer to the aching sinner's heart Redemption's healing mercies! And methinks (—Indulge the pleasing reverie, my soul! The waking dream, which in oblivion sweet Lulls thy o'erlabour'd sense!) methinks, convey'd To Ham's lov'd shades,—dear favourite shades, And pure religion sanctify'd,—I hear The tuneful bells their hallow'd message sound by peace To Christian hearts symphonious! Circling time Once more hath happily brought round the day Which calls us to the Temple of our God: Then let us haste, in decent neatness clad, My cheerful little household, to his courts, So lov'd, so truly honour'd! There we'll mix In meek, ingenuous deprecation's cry; There we'll unite in full thanksgiving's choir, And all the rich melodiousness of praise. I feel, I feel the rapture! David's harp Concordant with a thousand voices sounds: Prayer mounts exulting: Man ascends the skies On wings of angel-fervour! Holy writ Or speaks the wonders of Jehovah's power, Or tells, in more than mortal majesty, The greater wonders of his love to man! Proofs of that love, see where the mystic signs, High emblems of unutterable grace, Confirm to man the zeal of Heaven to save, And call to gratitude's best office! —Wise In all thy sacred institutions, Lord, Thy Sabbaths with peculiar wisdom shine; First and high argument, creation done, Of thy benign solicitude for man, Thy chiefest, favourite creature. Time is thine: How just to claim a part, who giv'st the whole! But oh, how gracious, to assign that part, To man's supreme behoof, his soul's best good; His mortal and his mental benefit; His body's genial comfort! Savage else, Untaught, undisciplin'd, in shaggy pride He'd rov'd the wild, amidst the brutes a brute Ferocious; to the soft civilities Of cultivated life, Religion, Truth, A barbarous stranger. To thy Sabbaths then All hail, wise Legislator! 'Tis to these We owe at once the memory of thy works, Thy mighty works of nature and of grace;— We owe divine religion; and to these The decent comeliness of social life. Revere, ye earthly magistrates, who wield, The sword of Heaven,—the wisdom of Heaven's plan, And sanctify the Sabbaths of your God! Religion's all: With that or stands or falls Your country's weal! but where shall she obtain, —Religion, sainted pilgrim,—shelter safe, Or honourable greeting;—thro' the land, If led by high and low, in giddy dance, Mad profanation on the sacred day Of God's appointed rest, her revel-rout Insulting heads, and leaves the temple void? —Oh, my lov'd country! oh, ye thoughtless great, Intoxicate with draughts, that opium-like For transient moments stupify the mind, To wake in horrors, and confusion wild!— But soft, and know thyself! 'Tis not for thee, Poor destitute! thus groveling in the dust Of self-annihilation, to assume The Censor's office, and reprove mankind. Ah me,—thy day of duty is declin'd! Thou, rather, to the quick probe thine own wounds, And plead for mercy at the judgment-seat, Where conscience smites thee for th'offence deplor'd. Yet not presumptuous deem it, Arbiter Of human thoughts, that through the long, long gloom Of multiply'd transgressions, I behold Complacent smiling on my sickening soul, “Delight in thy lov'd Sabbaths!” Well Thou know'st— For thou knowest all things,—that the cheerful sound Of that blest day's return, for circling weeks, For months, for years, for more than thrice seven years, Was music to my heart! My feet rejoic'd To bear me to thy temples, haply fraught With Comfort's tidings; with thy gospel's truth, The gospel of thy peace! Oh, well Thou know'st, Who knowest all things, with what welcome toil, What pleasing assiduity I search'd Thy heavenly word, to learn thy heavenly will; That faithful I might minister its truth, And of the high commission nought keep back From the great congregation Psalm xl. ver. 10. Well thou know'st, —Sole, sacred Witness of my private hours,— How copiously I bath'd with pleading tears, How earnestly in prayer consign'd to Thee The humble efforts of my trembling pen; My best, weak efforts in my Master's cause; Weak as the feather 'gainst the giant's shield, Light as the gosmer floating on the wind, Without-thy aid omnipotent! Thou know'st How, anxious to improve in every grace, That best to man's attention might commend Th'important message, studious I apply'd My feeble talents to the holy art Of suasive elocution; emulous Of every acquisition which might clothe In purest dignity the purest work, The first, the highest office man can bear, “The Messenger of God;” And well Thou know'st, —For all the work, as all the praise is Thine— What sweet success accompanied the toil: What harvests bless'd the seed-time! Well Thou know'st, With what triumphant gladness my rapt soul Wrought in the vineyard! how it thankful bore The noon day's heat, the evening's chilly frost, Exulting in its much-loved Master's cause To spend, and to be spent! and bring it home From triple labours of the well-toil'd day, A body by fatigue o'erborne; a mind Replete with glad emotions to its God! Ah my lov'd household! ah, my little round Of social friends! well do ye bear in mind Those pleasing evenings, when, on my return, Much-wish'd return—serenity the mild, And cheerfulness the innocent, with me Enter'd the happy dwelling! Thou, my Ernest, Ingenuous youth! whose early spring bespoke Thy summer, as it is, with richest crops Luxuriant waving; gentle youth, canst thou Those welcome hours forget? or thou—oh thou! —How shall I utter from my beating heart Thy name, so musical, so heavenly sweet Once to these ears distracted!—Stanhope, say, Canst thou forget those hours, when, cloth'd in smiles Of fond respect, thou and thy friend have strove Whose little hands should readiest supply My willing wants; officious in your zeal To make the Sabbath-evenings, like the day, A scene of sweet composure to my soul Good-Friday, Easter, &amp;c. once so peculiarly happy—yet how past here!—What a sad want of the spirit of reformation!! Oh happy Sabbaths!—Oh my soul's delight! Oh days of matchless mercy! matchless praise! Gone, gone, for ever gone! How dreadful spent, Useless, in tears, and groans, and bitter woe, In this wild place of horrors Bœthius has a reflection highly applicable to the sense of our Author:—“Nec insiciari possum prosperitatis meæ velocissimum cursum. Sed hoc est, quod recolentem me vehementius coquit. Nam in omni adversitate fortunæ, infelicissimum genus est infortunii, fuisse felicem.” De Consol. L. 2. Pros. 4.!—Oh, return, Ye happy Sabbaths!—or to that lov'd realm Dismiss me, Father of compassions, where Reigns one eternal Sabbath! Tho' my voice, Feeble at best, be damp'd, and cannot soar To strains sublime, beneath the sorrowing sense Of base ingratitude to thee, my God, My Father, Benefactor, Saviour, Friend,— Yet in that realm of rest, 'twill quickly catch Congenial harmony! 'twill quickly rise Even from humility's weak, trembling touch; Rise with the glowing seraph in the choir, And strive to be the loudest in thy praise. Too soaring thought! that, in a moment sunk By sad reflection and convicting guilt, Falls prostrate on the earth.—So, pois'd in air, And warbling his wild notes about the clouds, Almost beyond the ken of human sight; Clapp'd to his side his plumy steerage, down Drops—instantaneous drops the silent lark! —How shall I mount to Heaven? how join the choir Celestial of bright Seraphim? deprest Beneath the burden of a thousand sins, On what blest dove-like wing shall I arise, And fly to the wish'd rest? —Of counsel free, Some to my aching heart, with kind intent, Offer the poisonous balsam of desert; “Bid me take comfort from the cheering view “Of deeds benevolent, and active life “Spent for the weal of others!” Syren-songs, Soon hush'd by howlings of severe reproach, Unfeeling, uncompassionate, and rude, Which o'er my body, panting on the earth, With wounds incurable, insulting, whirls Her iron scourge: accumulates each ill That can to man's best fame damnation add: Spies not one mark of white throughout my life; And, groaning o'er my anguish, to despair, As my soul, sad resource, indignant points! But not from you,—ah cruel, callous foes, Thus to exult, and press a fallen man!— Nor even from you, tho' kind, mistaken friends, Admit we counsel here. Too deep the stake, Too awful the enquiry—how the soul May smile at death, and meet its God in peace— To rest the answer on uncertain man! Alike above your friendship, or your hate, Here, here I tour triumphant, and behold At once confirm'd security and joy, Beyond the reach of mortal hand to shake, Or for a moment cloud.—Hail, bleeding Love! In thy humiliation deep and dread, Divine Philanthropist, my ransom'd soul Beholds its triumph, and avows its cure! Its perfect, free salvation, knows or feels No merit, no dependence, but thy faith, Thy hope and love consummate! All abjures; Casts all,—each care, each burden, at the foot Of thy victorious cross: its heart and life One wish, one word uniting—ever may That wish and word in me, blest Lord, unite!— “Oh, ever may in me Thy will be done!” Firm and unshaken, as old Sion's Hill, Remains this sure foundation: who on Christ, The Corner-Stone, build faithful, build secure, Eternity is theirs. Then talk no more, Ye airy, vague, fantastic reasoners, Of the light stubble, crackling in the fire Of God's investigation; of the chaff Dispers'd, and floating 'fore the slightest wind,— The chaff of human merit! gracious God! What pride, what contradiction in the term! Shall man, vain man, drest in a little power Deriv'd from Nature's Author; and that power Holding, an humble tenant, at the will Of him who freely gave it; His high will, The dread Supreme Disposer, shall poor man, A beggar indigent and vile,—enrich'd With every precious faculty of soul, Of reason, intellect; with every gift Of animal life luxuriant—from the store Of unexhausted bounty; shall he turn That bounty to abuse? lavish defy The Giver with his gifts,—a rebel base! And yet, presumptuous, arrogant, deceiv'd, Assume a pride for actions not his own, Or boast of merit, when his all's for God, And he that all has squander'd! Purest saints, Brightest archangels, in the choir of heaven, Fulfilling all complete his holy will, Who plac'd them high in glory as they stand; Fulfil but duty! nay, as owing more From love's supreme distinction, readier veil Their radiant faces with their golden plumes; And fall more humbled 'fore the throne they hymn With gratitude superior. Could bold pride One moment whisper to their lucid souls Desert's intolerable folly,—down Like Lucifer, the Morning-star, they'd fall From their bright state obscur'd! Then, proud, poor worm, Conceiv'd in sins, offending from thy youth, In every point transgressor of the law Of righteousness; of merit towards God Dream, if thou can'st: or, madman if thou art, Stand on that plea for heav'n,—and be undone! Blest be thy tender mercy, God of Grace! That 'midst the terrors of this trying hour, When in this midnight, lonely, prison-gloom, My inmost soul hangs naked to thy view; When, undissembled in the search, I fain Would know, explore, and balance every thought (For oh, I see Eternity's dread gates Expand before me, soon perhaps to close!)— Blest be thy mercy, that, subdued to thee, Each lofty vain imagination bows; Each high idea humbled in the dust, Of self-sufficient righteousness my soul Disclaims, abhors, with reprobation full The slightest apprehension!—Worthless, Lord, Even of the meanest crumb beneath thy board. Blest be thy mercy, that, so far from due, I own thy bounties, manifold and rich, Upon my soul have laid a debt so deep, That I can never pay!—And oh! I feel Compunction inexpressible, to think How I have us'd those bounties! sackcloth-clad, And cover'd o'er with ashes, I deplore My utter worthlessness; and, trembling, own Thy wrath and just displeasure well might sink In deeper floods than these, that o'er my head Roar horrible,—in fiery floods of woe, That know nor end nor respite! but, my God, Blest be thy mercy ever! Thou'st not left My soul to Desperation's dark dismay! On Calvary's Hill my mourning eye discerns, With faith's clear view, that Spectacle which wipes Each tear away, and bids the heart exult! There hangs the Love of God! There hangs of man The Ransom; there the Merit; there the Cure Of human griefs—The Way, the Truth, the Life! Oh Thou, for sin burnt-sacrifice complete! Oh Thou, of holy life th'exemplar bright! Perfection's lucid mirrour! while to Thee Repentance scarce dare lift her flowing eyes, Though in his strong arms manly Faith supports The self-convicted mourner!—Let not love, Source of thy matchless mercies, aught delay, Like Mary, with Humility's meek hand Her precious box of costly Nard to pour On thy dear feet: diffusing through the house The odour of her unguents! Let not Love, Looking with Gratitude's full eye to Thee, Cease with the hallow'd fragrance of her works To cheer thy lowliest members; to refresh Thee in thy saints afflicted! Let not Love Cease with each spiritual grace, each temper mild, Fruits of the Holy Spirit,—to enrich, To fill, perfume, and sanctify the soul, Assimilate to Thee, sweet Jesu! Thee That soul's immortal habitant. How blest, How beyond value rich the privilege, To welcome such a Guest! how doubly blest With such a signature,—the royal stamp Of thy resemblance, Prince of Righteousness, Of Mercy, Peace, and Truth! Oh more and more Transform me to that Image! More and more Thou New Creation's Author, form complete In me the birth divine; the heavenly mind, The love consummate,—all-performing love, Which dwelt in Thee, its Pattern and its Source; And is to man, happy regenerate man, Heaven's surest foretaste, and its earnest too. The thought delights and cheers, though not elates: Through pensive Meditation's sable gloom It darts a ray of soft, well-temper'd light, A kind of lunar radiance on my soul, Gentle, not dazzling! Thou, who knowest all, Know'st well, thrice gracious Master! that my heart Attun'd to thy dear love, howe'er seduc'd By worldly adulation from its vows, And for a few contemptible, contemn'd Unhappy moments faithless; well thou know'st That heart ne'er knew true peace but in thy love: That heart hath in thy love known thorough peace! Hath frequent panted for that love's full growth; And sought occasions to display its warmth By deeds of kindness, mild humanity, And pitying mercy to its fellow-men! And thou hast blest me! and I will rejoice That thou hast blest me! thou hast giv'n my soul The Luxury of Luxuries, to wipe The tear from many an eye; to stop the groan At many an aching heart. And Thou wilt wipe The tears from mine, and Thou the groan repress: And Thou—for oh, this beating heart is thine, Fram'd by thy Hand to pity's quickest touch,— Thou wilt forgive the sinner; and bestow Mercy, sweet mercy! which, inspir'd by Thee, He never had the power, and ne'er the will, To hold from others, where he could bestow! Shall he not then rest happily secure Of mercy, thrice blest mercy from mankind? Where rests it?—Resignation's meek-eyed power Sustain me still; Composure still be mine: Where rests it?—Oh mysterious Providence! Silence the wild idea:—I have found No mercy yet; no mild humanity: With cruel unrelenting rigour torn, And, lost in prison, wild to all below; So from his daily toil returning late O'er Grison's rugged mountains, clad in snow, The peasant with astonish'd eyes beholds A gaunt wolf, from the pine-grove howling rush! Chill horror stiffens him, alike to fly Unable, to resist: the monster feeds Blood-happy, growling, on his quivering heart! Meanwhile light blazes in his lonely cot The crackling hearth; his careful wife prepares Her humble cates; and thro' the lattic'd light His little ones, expecting his return, Peep, anxious! Ah, poor victim, he nor hearth Bright blazing, nor the housewife's humble cates, Nor much-lov'd children henceforth more shall see! But soft: 'Tis calm reflection's midnight hour; 'Tis the soul's solemn inquest. Broods a thought Resentful in thy bosom? Art thou yet, Penitent pilgrim, on earth's utmost bourn, And candidate for Heaven,—art thou yet In love imperfect? and has malice place, With dark revenge, and unforgiving hate, Hell's blackest offspring?—Glory to my God! With triumph let me sing, and close my strain. Abhorrent ever from my earliest youth Of these detested passions, in this hour, This trying hour of keen oppressive grief, My soul superior rises; nor of these Malevolent, a touch, the slightest touch Feels, or shall ever harbour! Tho' it feels In all their amplitude, with all their weight, Ungentlest treatment, and a load of woe, Heavy as that which fabling poets lay On proud Enceladus! Tho' life be drawn By Cruelty's fierce hand down to the lees, Yet can my heart, with all the truth of prayer, With all the fervour of sincere desire, Looking at Thee, thou love of God and man!— Yet can my heart in life or death implore, “Father, forgive them, as Thou pitiest me!” Oh where's the wonder, when thy cross is seen! Oh, where's the wonder, when thy voice is heard; Harmonious intercession! Son of God. Oh, where's the wonder—or the merit where, Or what's the task to love-attuned souls— Poor fellow-creatures pitying, to implore Forgiveness for them? Oh forgive my foes! Best friends, perchance, for they may bring to Thee! —Complete forgiveness on them, God of grace! Complete forgiveness, in the dreadful hour, When most they need forgiveness! And oh such As, in that dreadful hour, my poor heart wants, And trusts, great Father, to receive from Thee, Such full forgiveness grant,—and my glad soul Shall fold them then, my brethren, in thy house! Thus do I sooth, and while away with song My lonely hours, in drear confinement past, Like thee, oh gallant Raleigh!—or like thee, My hapless ancestor, fam'd Overbury!— But Oh, in this how different is our fate! Thou, to a vengeful woman's subtle wiles A hapless victim fall'st; while my deep gloom, Brighten'd by female virtue and the light Of conjugal affection—leads me oft, Like the poor prison'd linnet, to forget Freedom, and tuneful friends, and russet heath, Vocal with native melody; to swell The feeble throat and chaunt the lowly strain; As in the season, when from spray to spray Flew liberty on light elastic wing, She flies no more:—Be mute, my plaintive lyre! March 15, 1777. END OF THE SECOND WEEK. WEEK THE THIRD. Public Punishment. Vain are thy generous efforts, worthy Bull Frederick Bull, Esq. Alderman of London; to whose kindness and humanity the Author has expressed the highest obligations., Thy kind compassion's vain! The hour is come: Stern fate demands compliance: I must pass Thro' various deaths, keen torturing, to arrive At that my heart so fervently implores; Yet fruitless. Ah! why hides he his fell front From woe, from wretchedness, that with glad smiles Would welcome his approach; and tyrant-like, Delights to dash the jocund roseate cup From the full hand of gaudy luxury And unsuspecting ease!—Far worse than death That prison's entrance, whose idea chills With freezing horror all my curdling blood; Whose very name, stamping with infamy, Makes my soul frighted start, in phrenzy whirl'd, And verging near to madness! See, they ope Their iron jaws! See the vast gates expand, Gate after gate—and in an instant twang, Clos'd by their growling keepers:—When again, Mysterious powers!—oh when to open on me? Mercy, sweet Heaven, support my faltering steps, Support my sickening heart! My full eyes swim: O'er all my frame distils a cold damp sweat. Hark—what a rattling din! On every side The congregated chains clank frightful: Throngs Tumultuous press around, to view, to gaze Upon the wretched stranger; scarce believ'd Other than visitor within such walls, With mercy and with freedom in his hands. Alas, how chang'd!—Sons of confinement, see No pitying deliverer, but a wretch O'erwhelm'd with misery, more hapless far Than the most hapless 'mongst ye; loaded hard With guilt's oppressive irons! His are chains No time can loosen, and no hand unbind: Fetters which gore the soul. Oh horror, horror! Ye massive bolts, give way: ye sullen doors, Ah, open quick, and from this clamorous rout, Close in my dismal, lone, allotted room Shrowd me;—for ever shrowd from human sight, And make it, if 'tis possible, my grave! How truly welcome, then! Then would I greet With hallow'd joy the drear, but blest abode; And deem it far the happiest I have known, The best I e'er inhabited. But, alas! There's no such mercy for me. I must run Misery's extremest round; and this must be A while my living grave; the doleful tomb, Sad sounding with my unremitted groans, And moisten'd with the bitterness of tears! Ah, mournful dwelling! destin'd ne'er to see The human face divine in placid smiles, And innocent gladness cloth'd: destin'd to hear No sounds of genial, heart-reviving joy! The sons of sorrows only are thy guests, And thine the only music of their sighs, Thick sobbing from the tempest of their breasts! Ah, mournful dwelling! never hast thou seen, Amidst the numerous wretched ones immur'd Within thy stone-girt compass, wretch so sunk, So lost, so ruin'd, as the man who falls Thus, in deep anguish, on thy ruthless floor, And bathes it with the torrent of his tears! And can it be? or is it all a dream? A vapour of the mind?—I scarce believe Myself awake or acting. Sudden thus Am I—so compass'd round with comforts late. Health, freedom, peace, torn, torn from all, and lost! A prisoner in—Impossible!—I sleep: 'Tis fancy's coinage; 'tis a dream's delusion. Vain dream! vain fancy! Quickly am I rous'd To all the dire reality's distress: I tremble, start, and feel myself awake, Dreadfully awake to all my woes; and roll From wave to wave on Sorrow's ocean tost! Oh for a moment's pause,—a moment's rest, To calm my hurried spirits! to recall Reflection's staggering pilot to the helm, And still the maddening whirlwind in my soul! —It cannot be! The din increases round: Rough voices rage discordant; dreadful shrieks! Hoarse imprecations dare the thunderer's ire, And call down swift damnation! thousand chains In dismal notes clink, mirthful! Roaring bursts Of loud obstreperous laughter, and strange choirs Of gutturals, dissonant and rueful, vex E'en the dull ear of Midnight! Neither rest, Nor peaceful calm, nor silence of the mind, Refreshment sweet, nor interval or pause From morn to eve, from eve to morn is found Amidst the surges of this troubled sea It is but a just tribute to Mr. Akerman, the keeper of this dismal place, to observe, that all the evils here enumerated are the immediate consequences of promiscuous confinement, and no way chargeable to Mr. A.'s account. It is from the strictest observation, I am persuaded, that no man could do more in the present circumstances. His attention is great, and his kindness and humanity to those in sickness or affliction, peculiarly pleasing. I can bear testimony to many signal instances, which I have remarked since my sad confinement.! So, from the Leman Lake th'impetuous Rhone His blue waves pushes rapid, and bears down (Furiate to meet Saone's pellucid stream, With roar tremendous, thro' the craggy streights Of Alpine rocks) his freight of waters wild: Still rushing in perturbed eddies on; And still, from hour to hour, from age to age, In conflux vast and unremitting, pours His boisterous flood to old Lugdunim's wall! Oh my rack'd brain—oh my distracted heart! The tumult thickens: wild disorder grows More painfully confus'd!—And can it be? Is this the mansion—this the house ordain'd For recollection's solemn purpose;—this The place from whence full many a flitting soul (The work of deep repentance—mighty work, Still, still to be perform'd) must mount to God, And give its dread account! Is this the place Ordain'd by justice, to confine a while The foe to civil order, and return Reform'd and moraliz'd to social life! This den of drear confusion, wild uproar, Of mingled riot and unblushing vice! This school of infamy! from whence, improv'd In every hardy villany, returns More harden'd, more a foe to God and man, The miscreant, nurs'd in its infectious lap; All cover'd with its pestilential spots, And breathing death and poison wheresoe'er He stalks contagious! from the lion's den A lion more ferocious as confin'd! Britons, while sailing in the golden barge Of giddy dissipation, on the stream, Smooth silver stream of gorgeous luxury, Boast gaily—and for ages may they boast, And truly! for through ages we may trust 'Twill interpose between our crimes and God, And turn away his just avenging scourge— “The national Humanity!” Hither then, Ye sons of pity, and ye sons of thought!— Whether by public zeal and patriot love, Or by Compassion's gentle stirrings wrought, Oh hither come, and find sufficient scope For all the patriot's, all the christian's search! Some great, some salutary plan to frame, Turning confinement's curses into good; And, like the God who but rebukes to save, Extracting comfort from correction's stroke! Why do we punish? Why do penal laws Coercive, by tremendous sanctions bind Offending mortals?—Justice on her throne Rigid on this hand to example points; More mild to reformation upon that: —She balances, and finds no ends but these. Crowd then, along with yonder revel-rout, To exemplary punishment, and mark The language of the multitude, obscene, Wild, blasphemous, and cruel! Tent their looks Of madding, drunken, thoughtless, ruthless gaze, Or giddy curiosity and vain! Their deeds still more emphatic, note; and see, By the sad spectacle unimpress'd, they dare Even in the eye of death, what to their doom Brought their expiring fellows! Learn we hence, How to example's salutary end Our justice sagely ministers! But one,— Should there be one—thrice hapless,—of a mind By guilt unharden'd, and above the throng Of desperate miscreants, thro' repeated crimes In stupor lull'd, and lost to every sense;— Ah me, the sad reverse!—should there be one Of generous feelings; whom remorseless fate, Pallid necessity, or chill distress, The family's urgent call, or just demand Of honest creditor,—(solicitudes To reckless, pamper'd worldlings all unknown) Should there be one, whose trembling, frighted hand Causes like these in temporary guilt, Abhorrent to his inmost soul, have plung'd, And made obnoxious to the rigid law! Sentenc'd to pay,—and, wearied with its weight, Well-pleas'd to pay with life that law's demand, Awful dispensers of strict justice, say, Would you have more than life? or, in an age, A country, where humanity reverts At torture's bare idea, would you tear Worse than on racking wheels a soul like this, And make him to the stupid crowd a gaze For lingering hours?—drag him along to death An useless spectacle; and more than flay Your living victim?—Death is your demand: Death your law's sentence: then this life is yours. Take the just forfeit; you can claim no more! Foe to thy infidelity,—and griev'd That he avows not, from the christian source, The first great christian duty, which so well, So forcibly he paints!—Yet let me greet With heart-felt gratulations thy warm zeal, Successful in that sacred duty's cause, The cause of our Humanity, Voltaire! Torture's vile agents trembling at thy pen: Intolerance and Persecution gnash Their teeth, despairing, at the lucid rays Of truth all prevalent, beaming from thy page. The rack, the wheel, the dungeon, and the flame, In happier Europe useless and unknown, Shall soon,—oh speed the hour, Compassion's God, Be seen no more; or seen as prodigies Scarce credited, of Gothic barbarous times. Ah, gallant France, for milder manners fam'd, How wrung it my sad soul, to view expos'd On instruments of torture—mangled limbs And bleeding carcases, beside thy roads, Thy beauteous woods and avenues! Fam'd works, And worthy well the grandeur of old Rome! We too, who boast of gentler laws, reform'd And civiliz'd by liberty's kind hand: Of mercy boast, and mildest punishments: Yet punishments of torture exquisite And idle;—painful, ruinous parade! We too, with Europe humaniz'd, shall drop The barbarous severity of death, Example's bane, not profit;—shall abridge The savage base ovation; shall assign The wretch, whose life is forfeit to the laws, With all the silent dignity of woe, With all the mournful majesty of death, Retir'd and solemn, to his awful fate! Shall to the dreadful moment, moment still To souls best fitted, give distinction due; Teach the well-order'd sufferer to depart With each impression serious; nor insult With clamorous crowds and exultations base, A soul, a fellow-soul, which stands prepar'd On time's dread verge to take its wonderous flight, To realms of immortality! Yes, the day —I joy in the idea,—will arrive, When Britons philanthropic shall reject The cruel custom, to the sufferer cruel, Useless and baneful to the gaping crowd! The day will come, when life, the dearest price Man can pay down, sufficient forfeit deem'd For guilty man's transgression of the law, Shall be paid down, as meet for such a price, Respectful, sad; with reverence to a soul's Departure hence; with reverence to the soul's And body's separation, much-lov'd friends! Without a torture to augment its loss, Without an insult to molest its calm; To the demanded debt no fell account Of curious, hissing ignominy annex'd: Anguish, beyond the bitterest torture keen; Unparallel'd in realms where bigotry Gives to the furious sons of Dominic Her sable flag, and marks their way with blood. Hail, milder sons of Athens! civiliz'd By arts ingenious, by the 'suasive power Of humanizing science: well ye thought, Like you may Britons think, that 'twas enough, The sentence pass'd, a Socrates should die! The sage, obedient to the law's decree, Took from the weeping executioner The draught, resign'd: amidst his sorrowing friends, Full of immortal hopes convers'd sublime; And, half in Heaven—compos'd himself, and died! Oh envy'd fate! oh happiness supreme! So let me die; so, midst my weeping friends, Resign my life! I ask not the delay Ev'n of a moment. Law, thou'dst have thy due! Nor thou, nor justice, can have more to claim. But equal laws, on truth and reason built, Look to humanity with lenient eye, And temper rigid justice with the claims Of heaven-descended mercy! to condemn Sorrowing and slow; while studious to correct, Like man's all-gracious parent, with the view Benign and laudable, of moral good, And reformation perfect. Hither then, Ye sons of sympathy, of wisdom; friends To order, to compassion, to the state, And to your fellow-beings; hither come, To this wild realm of uproar! hither haste, And see the reformation, see the good Wrought by confinement in a den like this! View, with unblushing front, undaunted heart, The callous harlot in the open day Administer her poisons, 'midst a rout Scarcely less bold or poison'd than herself! View, and with eyes that will not hold the tear In gentle pity gushing for such griefs,— View, the young wretch, as yet unfledg'd in vice, Just shackled here, and by the veteran throng, In every infamy and every crime Grey and insulting, quickly taught to dare, Harden'd like them in guilt's opprobrious school; Each bashful sentiment, incipient grace, Each yet remorseful thought of right and wrong Murder'd and buried in his darken'd heart!— Hear how those veterans clank,—ev'n jovial clank —Such is obduracy and vice,—their chains This circumstance is slightly mentioned before; and alludes to a fact equally singular and disgustful. The rattling of their fetters is frequently, and in a wanton manner, practised amongst some of the worst offenders; as if an amusement, or to shew their insensibility to shame. How shocking to see human nature thus in ruins! Here it is emphatically so, worse than in bedlam, as Madness with reason is more dreadful than without it!! Hear, how with curses hoarse and vauntings bold, Each spirits up, encourages and dares His desperate fellow to more desperate proofs Of future hardy enterprize; to plans Of death and ruin! Not exulting more Heroes or chiefs for noble acts renown'd, Holding high converse, mutually relate Gallant atchievements worthy, than the sons Of plunder and of rapine here recount On peaceful life their devastations wild; Their dangers, hair-breadth'scapes, atrocious feats, Confederate, and confederating still In schemes of deathful horror! Who, surpriz'd, Can such effects contemplate, upon minds Estrang'd to good; fermenting on the lees Of pregnant ill; associate and combin'd In intercourse infernal, restless, dire; And goading constant each to other's thoughts To deeds of desperation from the tale Of vaunted infamy oft told: sad fruit Of the mind's vacancy!—And to that mind Employment none is offer'd: not an hour To secret recollection is assign'd; No seasonable sound instruction brought, Food for their thoughts, self-gnawing. Not the day To rest and duty dedicate, finds here Or rest or duty; revel'd off, unmark'd; Or like the others undistinguish'd, save By riot's roar, and self-consuming sloth! For useful occupation none is found, Benevolent t'employ their listless hands, With indolence fatigued! Thus every day Anew they gather Guilt's corrosive rust; Each wretched day accumulates fresh ills; And horribly advanc'd, stagitious grown From faulty, they go forth, tenfold of Hell More the devoted children: to the state Tenfold more dangerous and envenom'd foes Than first they enter'd this improving school! So, cag'd and scanty fed, or taught to rage By taunting insults, more ferocious burst On man the tyger or hyæna race From fell confinement; and, with hunger urg'd, Gnash their dire fangs, and drench themselves in blood. But, should the felon fierce, th'abandon'd train Whose inroads on the human peace forbid, Almost forbid Compassion's mild regard; (Yet, ah! what man with fellow-men can fall So low, as not to claim soft pity's care!) Should these aught justify the rigid voice, Which to severe confinement's durance dooms Infallible the body and the soul To bitterest, surest ruin, shall we not With generous indignation execrate The cruel indiscriminating law, Which turns misfortune into guilt and curse, And with the felon harden'd in his crimes Ranks the poor hapless debtor?—Debt's not guilt: Alas! the worthiest may incur the stroke Of worldly infelicity! What man, How high soe'er he builds his earthly nest, Can claim security from fortune's change, Or boast him of to-morrow! Of the east Greatest and chief, lo! humbled in the dust, Sits Job the sport of misery! Wealthiest late Of all blest Araby's most wealthy sons, He wants a potsherd now to scrape his wounds; He wants a bed to shrowd his tortur'd limbs, And only finds a dunghill! Creditor, Wouldst thou add sorrows to this sorrowing man? Tear him from ev'n his dunghill, and confine 'Midst recreant felons in a British jail!— Oh British in humanity! Ye climes, Ye foreign climes—Be not the truth proclaim'd Within your streets, nor be it heard or told; Lest ye retort the cruelty we urge, And scorn the boasted mildness of our laws! Blest be the hour,—amidst my depth of woe, Amidst this perturbation of my soul, God of my life, I can, I will exult!— Blest be the hour, that to my humble thought Thy spirit, sacred source of every good, Brought the sublime idea, to expand By charity, the angels grace divine, The rude, relentless, iron prison-gates, And give the pining debtor to the world, His weeping family, and humble home! Blest be the hour, when, heedful to my voice Bearing the prisoners sad sighs to their ears, Thousands, with soft commiseration touch'd, Delighted to go forth, and visit glad Those prisoners in their woe, and set them free! God of the merciful! Thou hast announc'd On mercy, thy first, dearest attribute, Chosen beatitude. Oh pour the dew, The fostering dew of mercy on their gifts, Their rich donations grateful! May the prayers Of those enfranchis'd by their bounteous zeal Arise propitious for them! and, when hears'd In death's cold arms this hapless frame shall lie, —The generous tear, perchance, not quite withheld;— When friendly memory to reflection brings My humble efforts and my mournful fate; On stable basis founded, may the work Diffuse its good through ages! nor withhold Its rescuing influence, till the hour arrives When wants, and debts, and sickness are no more, And universal freedom blesseth all! But, till that hour, on reformation's plan, Ye generous sons of sympathy, intent, Boldly stand forth. The cause may well demand, And justify full well your noblest zeal. Religion, policy, your country's good, And christian pity for the souls of men, To prisons call you; call to cleanse away The filth of these foul dens; to purge from guilt, And turn them to morality's fair school. Nor deem impossible the great attempt, Augæan tho' it seem: yet not beyond The strength of those that, like Alcides, aim High to be rank'd amidst the godlike few, Who shine eternal on fame's amplest roll: Honour'd with titles, far beyond the first Which proudest monarchs of the globe can give; “Saviours and benefactors of mankind!” Hail, generous Hanway! To thy noble plan, Sage sympathetic See Mr. Hanway's pamphlet, entituled, “Solitude in Imprisonment.”, let the muse subscribe, Rejoicing! In the kind pursuit, good luck She wisheth thee, and honour. Could her strain Embellish aught, or aught assist they toils Benevolent, 'twould cheer her lonely hours, And make the dungeon smile. But toils like thine Need no embellishment; need not the aid Of muse or feeble verse. Reason-approv'd And charity-sustain'd, firm will they stand, Under his sanction, who on mercy's works E'er looks complacent; and his sons on earth, His chosen sons, with angel-zeal inspires To plan and to support. And thine well-plann'd, Shall be supported. Pity for thy brow, With policy the sage, shall shortly twine The garland, worthier far than that of oak, So fam'd in ancient Rome—the meed of him Who sav'd a single citizen. More bless'd Religion mild, with gentle mercy join'd, Shall hail thee—for the citizens, the souls Innumerous restor'd to God, the state, Themselves, and social life, by solitude; Devotion's parent, Recollection's nurse, Source of repentance true; of the mind's wounds The deepest prober, but the safest cure Vide Taylor's Holy Living and Dying, part ii. p. 42.! Hail, sacred solitude! These are thy works, True source of good supreme! Thy blest effects Already on my mind's delighted eye Open beneficent. E'en now I view The revel-rout dispers'd; each to his cell Admitted, silent! The obstreperous cries Worse than infernal yells; the clank of chains— Opprobrious chains, to man severe disgrace, Hush'd in calm order, vex the ears no more! While, in their stead, reflection's deep-drawn sighs, And prayers of humble penitence are heard, To heaven well-pleasing, in soft whispers round! No more, 'midst wanton idleness, the hours Drag wearisome and slow: kind industry Gives wings and weight to every moment's speed; Each minute marking with a golden thread Of moral profit. Harden'd vice no more Communicates its poison to the souls Of young associates, nor diffuses wide A pestilential taint. Still thought pervades The inmost heart: instruction aids the thought; And blest religion with life-giving ray Shines on the mind sequester'd in its gloom; Disclosing glad the golden gates, thro' which Repentance, led by faith, may tread the courts Of peace and reformation! Cheer'd and chang'd, —His happy days of quarantine perform'd— Lo, from his solitude the captive comes New-born, and opes once more his grateful eyes On day, on life, on man, a fellow man! Hail sacred solitude! from thee alone Flow these high blessings. Nor be't deem'd severe, Such sequestration; destin'd to retrieve The mental lapse; and to its powers restore The Heaven-born soul, encrusted with foul guilt: 'Tis tenderest mercy, 'tis humanity Yearning with kindliest softness: while her arm From ruin plucks, effectuates the release, And gives a ransom'd man to earth—to Heaven! To the sick patient, struggling in the jaws Of obstinate disease, e'er knew we yet Grateful and pleasing from physician's hand The rough, but salutary draught?—For that Do we withhold the draught? and, falsely kind, Hang sighing o'er our friend,—allow'd to toss On the hot fever's bed, rave on and die, Unmedicin'd, unreliev'd?—But sages, say, Where is the medicine? Who will prescribe a cure, Or adequate to this corroding ill, Or in its operation milder found? See, on old Thames's waves indignant ride, In sullen terror, yonder sable bark, By state-physicians lately launch'd, and hight Justitia The Author seems chiefly to have formed his idea of the mode of treating convicts on the Thames from a late pamphlet published by Dr. Smith: But we are informed that the evils here complained of have been already, in a great measure, and we trust will soon be wholly, removed.! Dove-eyed Pity, if thou canst That bark ascend with me, and let us learn How, temper'd with her sister Mercy, there Reigns justice; and, effective to the ill Inveterate grown, her lenient aid supplies. And rolls this bark on Thames's generous flood— Flood that wafts freedom, wafts the high-born sons Of gallant liberty to every land? See the chain'd Britons, fetter'd man by man! See in the stifled hold—excluded whence Man's common blessing, air ne'er freely breathes— They mingle, crowded!—To our pamper'd steeds Inferior how in lodging! Tainted food And poison'd fumes their life-springs stagnate rank They reel aloft for breath: their tottering limbs Bend weak beneath the burden of a frame Corrupted, burning; with blue feverous spots Contagious; and, unequal to the toil, Urg'd by task-masters vehement, severe, On the chill sand-bank!—by despair and pain Worn down and wearied, some their being curse, And die, devoting to destruction's rage Society's whole race detested! Some, More mild, gasp out in agonies of soul Their loath'd existence; which nor physic's aid, Nor sweet religion's interposing smile, Soothes with one ray of comfort! Gracious God! And this is mercy!—Thus, from sentenc'd death Britons in pity respite, to restore And moralize mankind! Correction this, Just Heaven, design'd for reformation's end! Ye slaves, that bred in tyranny's domains Toil at the gallies, how supremely blest, How exquisite your lot (so much deplor'd By haughty sons of freedom) to the fate Experienc'd hourly by her free-born sons, In our Britannia's vaunted residence There is a thought in Lucan to the same purpose, elegantly expressed: “Felices Arabes, Medique, Eoaque Tellus, “Quam sub perpetuis tenuerunt fata tyrannis. “Ex populis, qui regna ferunt, Sors ultima nostra est, “Quos servire pudet.” Pharsal. Lib. 7.; Sole, chosen residence of faith refin'd, And genuine liberty! Ye senators, Ye venerable sages of the law, In just resentment for your country's fame, Wipe off this contradictory reproach To manners, and to policy like yours! Correct, but to amend: 'Tis God's own plan. Correct, but to reform; then give to men The means of reformation! Then, restor'd To recollection, to himself, to God, The criminal will bless your saving hand; And, brought to reason, to religion brought, Will own that solitude, as solely apt For work so solemn, has that work atchiev'd, Miraculous, and perfect of his cure. Ah me!—to sentiments like these estrang'd, Estrang'd, as ignorant,—and never pent Till this sad chance within a prison's wall, With what deep force, experienc'd, can I urge The truths momentous! How their power I feel In this my solitude, in this lone hour, This melancholy midnight hour of thought, Encircled with th'unhappy! firmly clos'd Each barricaded door, and left, just God, Oh blessing—left to pensiveness and Thee! To me how high a blessing! Nor contains Seclusion aught of punishment: to mix With wretches here were punishment indeed! How dread a punishment!—In life's best days, Of all most chosen, valued and belov'd, Was soft retirement's season. From youth's dawn To solitude inur'd, “ne'er less alone “Than when alone,” with him so truly fam'd In wisdom's school, my heart could ever beat Glad unison. To meditation's charms, Pleas'd votary, how have pass'd my sweetest hours In her secrete and calm society! Still Meditation, Solitude's fair child, Man's dearest friend,—O happy be the time That introduc'd me to the hallow'd train; That taught me, thro' thy genial lessons sage, My best, my truest dignity to place In thought, reflection deep, and studious search, Divinest recreations of the mind! Oh, happy be the day which gave that mind Learning's first tincture—blest thy fostering care, Thou most belov'd of parents, worthiest sire! Which, taste-inspiring, made the letter'd page My favourite companion: most esteem'd, And most improving! Almost from the day Of earliest childhood to the present hour Of gloomy, black misfortune, books, dear books, Have been, and are, my comforts. Morn and night, Adversity, prosperity, at home, Abroad, health, sickness,—good or ill report, The same firm friends; the same refreshment rich, And source of consolation! Nay, e'en here Their magic power they lose not: still the same, Of matchless influence in this prison-house, Unutterably horrid; in an hour Of woe, beyond all fancy's fictions drear. Drear hour!—What is it?—Lost in poignant thought, Lost in the retrospection manifold Of thee, lov'd study,—and of thee, my sire, Who, to the fountain fair of Science led My infant feet,—I lose all count of time, I lose myself. List—'tis dread midnight's hour, When waking fancy (with invention wild By ages hallow'd) hath to spirits assign'd —Spirits of dear departed friends—to walk The silent gloom, and bring us from the dead Tales harrowing up the soul aghast!—And, hark! Solemn and slow the iron tongue of night Resounds alarming!—My o'er-harrass'd soul, Confus'd, is lost in sorrows: down mine eyes Stream the full tears, distress is all alive, And quick imagination's pulse beats high! “Dear father, is it thou?” Methought his ghost Glided in silence by me! Not a word,— While mournfully he shakes his dear pale face! O stay, thou much-lov'd parent! stay, and give One word of consolation; if allow'd To son, like whom no son hath ever lov'd, None ever suffer'd! See, it comes again: August it flits across th'astonish'd room! I know thee well, thy beauteous image know: Dear spirit stay, and take me to the world Where thou art. And where thou art, oh my father, I must, I must be happy.—Every day Thou know'st, remembrance hath embalm'd thy love, And wish'd thy presence. Melancholy thought, At last to meet thee in a place like this! Oh stay, and waft me instant—But, 'tis gone, The dear delusion! He nor hears my words, My filial anxiety, nor regards My pleading tears. 'Twas but a coinage vain Of the distemper'd fancy! Gone, 'tis gone, And here I'm left a trembling wretch, to weep Unheard, unpitied left, to weep alone! Nor thou, Maria, with me! Oh, my wife, And is this bitter with the bitterest mix'd, That I must lose thy heavenly company, And consolation soothing! Yet, 'tis best: Thy tenderness, thy presence, doth but wound And stab to the keenest quick my bursting heart! “I have undone thee!” Can I then sustain Thy killing aspect, and that tender tear Which secret steals a-down thy lovely face, Dissembling smiles to cheer me—cheer me, Heavens! Look on the mighty ruin I have pluck'd, Pluck'd instant, unsuspected, in the hour Of peace and dear security on her head! And where—O where can cheerfulness be found? Mine must be mourning ever. Oh my wife, “I have undone thee!”—What th'infuriate hand Of foes vindictive could not have atchiev'd, In mercy would not, I have wrought! Thy husband! Thy husband, lov'd with such unshaken truth, Thy husband, lov'd with such a steady flame, From youth's first hour!—Ev'n he hath on thee pluck'd, On thee, his soul's companion, life's best friend, Such desolation, as to view would draw From the wild savage pity's deepest groan! Yes, yes, thou coward mimic, pamper'd vice, High praise be sure is thine. Thou hast obtain'd A worthy triumph Alluding to the character of Mrs. Simony, introduced by Mr. Foote in his play of The Cozeners.! Thou hast pierc'd to the quick A weak, an amiable female heart, A conjugal heart most faithful, most attach'd: Yet can I pardon thee: for, poor buffoon, Thy vices must be fed; and thou must live, Luxurious live, a foe to God and man; Commission'd live, thy poison to diffuse, And taint the public virtue with thy crimes. Yes, I can pardon thee—low as thou art, And far too mean an object ev'n of scorn; For thou her merits knew'st not. Hadst thou known, Thou,—callous as thou art to every sense Of human feeling, every nobler touch Of generous sensibility,—even thou Couldst not have wanton pierc'd her gentle breast; But at a distance awful wouldst have stood, And, like thy prototype of oldest time, View'd her just virtues pass in triumph by, And own'd, howe'er reluctant— March 30, 1772. END OF THE THIRD WEEK. WEEK THE FOURTH. The Trial. Dread'st thou an earthly bar? Thou who so oft In contemplation serious hast employ'd Thy dearest meditations on a bar Tremendously decisive! who so oft That bar's important terrors hast display'd To crowds attentive; with the solemn theme Rapt in thought profound—And beats thy heart With throbs tumultuous—fail thy trembling knees, Now that in judgment thou must stand before Weak mortals, like thyself, and soon like thee, Shivering with guilt and apprehensions dire, To answer in dread judgment 'fore their God! What gives that judgment terror? Guilt, pale guilt; Conscience accusing stern; the fiery law, The terrible hand-writing on the wall! But vanish these,—that mighty day's-man found, Who, smiling on confession's genuine tear, The meek repentant aspect, and the hand With ready, perfect retribution fraught, Urges complete his ransom, and sets free Th'immortal prisoner.—But, ah me! on earth Such golden mercy reigns not: here is found No potent day's-man; here no ransom full, No clement mediator. Here stern law, With visage all unbending, eyes alone The rigorous act. Confession here is guilt, And restitution perfect, perfect loss! Ah me the while, here men the judges are; And there, th'Omniscient mercy's source and stream! Triumphant consolation! Firm in faith, And justify'd by him whose precious blood For man flow'd liberal, the soul secure Of future acceptation at that bar Of trial most momentous, soars above The world's severest trials The verses subjoined were written by the King of Prussia, after a defeat, when one of his general officers had proposed to set him the example of self-destruction: Dans ces jours, pleins d'alarmes, La constance et la fermeté Sont les bouchers et les armes Que j'opppose á l'adversitè: Que le Destin me persecute, Qu'il prepare ou hâte ma chute, Le danger ne peut m'ebranler: Quand le vulgaire est plein de crainte, Que l'esperance semble eteinte, L'homme fort doit se signaler. A friend having given Dr. Dodd in prison a copy of these lines, he was much pleased with them, and immediately paraphrased them as follows: In these sad moments of severe distress, When dangers threaten, and when sorrows press, For my defence behold what arms are given— Firmness of soul, and confidence in Heaven! With these, tho' Fortune hunt me thro' the land, Tho' instant, utter ruin seem at hand, Compos'd and self-collected I remain, Nor start at perils, nor of ills complain. To mean despair the low, the servile fly, When Hope's bright star seems darken'd in their sky: Then shines the Christian, and delights to prove His faith unshaken, and unchang'd his love!, and can view Serene the horrors of an earthly bar, Though far than death more horrid. Yes, kind death, How preferable far thy sight to me! Oh that, without this tedious, dread detail Of awful circumstance,—this long, sad pomp Of ministering wretchedness, thy friendly shaft Had instant reach'd, and pierc'd my tortur'd heart: How had I bless'd the stroke, and been at peace! But thro' a dreary avenue of woe, A lengthen'd vault of black distress and shame, With mournful melancholy sable hung, Must I be led Segnius irritant animos demissa per aurem, Quam quæ sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus, et quæ Ipse sibi tradit Spectator! Hor.,—or ere I can receive Thine icy comforts to my chill'd life's blood! Welcome, thrice welcome were they. But the call Of Heaven's dread arbiter we wait: His will Is rectitude consummate. 'Tis the will Parental of high wisdom and pure love. Then to that will submissive bend, my soul: And, while meek resignation to the rod Corrective of his justice and his love Obedient bows,—Oh for impartial search! Oh for a trial strict, to trace the cause, The fatal cause, whence sprung the ill deplor'd! And why—sad spectacle of woe—we stand Thus, sin and sorrow sunk, at this dread bar! Return, blest hours—ye peaceful days, return! When thro' each office of celestial love Ennobling piety my glad feet led Continual, and my head each night to rest Lull'd on the downy pillow of content! Dear were thy shades, O Ham, and dear the hours In manly musing 'midst thy forests pass'd, And antique woods of sober solitude, Oh Epping, witness to my lonely walks By Heaven-directed contemplation led! Ye days of duty, tranquil nights, return! How ill exchang'd for those, which busier scenes To the world's follies dedicate, engross'd, In specious trifling; all important deem'd, While guilt, O Chesterfield, with seeming gold Of prime refinement, thro' thy fostering smile, And patronage auspicious! Sought by thee, And singled out, unpatroniz'd, unknown; By thee, whose taste consummate was applause, Whose approbation merit; forth I came, And with me to the task, delighted, brought The upright purpose, the intention firm To fill the charge, to justify the choice, Perchance too flattering to my heart; a heart Frank, inexpert, unhackney'd in the world, And yet estrang'd to guile! But ye, more skill'd In that world's artful style, judges severe; Say, in the zenith of bright Stanhope's sun (Though set that sun, alas, in misty clouds!) Say 'midst his lustre, whom would not that choice Have flatter'd?—and still more, when urg'd, approv'd, And bless'd by thee, St. David's! Honour'd friend; Alike in wisdom's and in learning's school Advanc'd and sage!—Short pause, my muse, and sad Allow, while leaning on affection's arm Deep-sighing Gratitude, with tears of truth, Bedews the urn, the happy urn, where rest Mingled thy ashes, oh my friend; and hers Whose life bound up with thine in amity Indissolubly firm, felt thy last pang Disrupting as her own; gently sigh'd forth The precious boon: while sprung her faithful soul, Indignant without thee to rest below, On wings of love, to meet thee in the skies! Blest pair! and envied! Envied and embalm'd In our recording memory, my wife, My friend, my lov'd Maria, be our lot Like theirs!—But soft,—ah my foreboding thoughts! Repress the gushing tear;—return, my song. Plac'd thus, and shelter'd underneath a tree, Which seem'd like that in visions of the night To Babylonia's haughty prince pourtray'd, Whose height reach'd Heaven, and whose verdant boughs Extended wide their succour and their shade, How did I trust, too confident! How dream That fortune's smiles were mine; and how deceiv'd, By gradual declension yield my trust, My humble happy trust on Thee, my God! How ill exchang'd for confidence in man, In Chesterfields, in princes!—Wider scenes, Alps still on Alps were open'd to my view; And, as the circle in the flood enlarg'd, Enlarg'd expences call. Fed to the full With flattery's light food So praysen babes the peacock's starry traine, And wondren at bright Argus' blazing eye; But who rewards him e'er the more for thy? Or feeds him once the fuller by a graine?— Sike praise is smoke, that sheddeth in the skie, Sike words been winde, and wasten soon in vaine. Spenser., and the puff'd wind Of promises delusive—“Onward still, “Press onward,” cried the world's alluring-voice; “The time of retribution is at hand: “See the ripe vintage waits thee!” Fool and blind, Still credulous I heard, and still pursued The airy meteor glittering thro' the mire, Thro' brake and bog, till more and more ingulph'd In the deceitful quag, floundering I lay. Nor heard was then the world's alluring voice, Or promises delusive: then not seen The tree umbrageous, with its ample shade: For me, alas, that tree had shade no more! But, struggling in the gulph, my languid eye Saw only round the barren rushy moor, The flat, wide dreary desart:—Till a hope, Dress'd by the tempter in an angel's form, Presenting its fair hand,—imagin'd fair, Though foul as murkiest Hell, to drag me forth, Down to the centre plung'd me, dark and dire Of howling ruin;—bottomless abyss Of desolating shame, and nameless woe! But, witness Heaven and earth, 'midst this brief stage, This blasting period of my chequer'd life, Tho' by the world's gay vanities allur'd, I danc'd, too oft, alas, with the wild rout Of thoughtless fellow-mortals, to the sound Of folly's tinkling bells; tho' oft, too oft Those pastimes shar'd enervating, which ill —Howe'er by some judg'd innocent,—become Religion's sober character and garb: Tho' oft, too oft, by weak compliance led, External seemings, and the ruinous bait Of smooth politeness, what my heart condemn'd Unwise it practis'd; never without pang; Tho' too much influenc'd by the pleasing force Of native generosity, uncurb'd And unchastis'd (as reason, duty taught) Prudent œconomy, in thy sober school Of parsimonious lecture; useful lore, And of prime moment to our worldly weal; —Yet witness Heaven and earth, amidst this dream, This transient vision, ne'er so slept my soul, Or sacrific'd my hands at folly's shrine, As to forget Religion's public toil, Study's improvement, or the pleading cause Of suffering humanity.—Gracious God, How wonderful a compound, mixture strange, Incongruous, inconsistent, is frail man!

Yes, beauteous fane, To bright religion dedicate, thou well My happy public labours canst attest, Unwearied and successful in the cause, The glorious, honour'd cause of Him, whose love Bled for the human race. Thou canst attest The Sabbath-days delightful, when the throng Crowded thy hallow'd walls with eager joy, To hear truth evangelical; the sound Of gospel comfort! When attentive sat, Or at the holy altar humbly knelt, Persuasive, pleasing patterns—Athol's Duke, The polish'd Hervey, Kingston the humane, Aylesbury and Marchmont, Romney all-rever'd; With numbers more—by splended titles less Than piety distinguish'd and pure zeal.

Oh happy toil, oh labours well employ'd, Oh sweet remembrance to my sickening soul, Blest volumes! Nor tho' levell'd in the dust Of self-annihilation, shall my soul Cease to rejoice, or thy preventive grace Adoring laud, Fountain of every good! For that no letter'd poison ever stain'd My page, how weak soe'er; for that my pen, However humble, ne'er has trac'd a line Of tendency immortal, whose black guilt It well might wish to blot with tears of blood, Dear to the christian shall my little works, —Effusions of a heart sincere, devote To God and duty, happily survive Their wretched master; and thro' lengthen'd years To souls opprest, comfort's sweet balm impart, And teach the pensive mourner how to die Referring to “Comfort for the Afflicted,” and “Reflections on Death.”. Thou too, blest Charity, whose golden key So liberal unlocks the prison's gate At the poor debtor's call; oh, witness thou, To cruel taxers of my time and thought, All was not lost, all were not misemploy'd, Nor all humanity's fair rights forgot: Since thou, spontaneous effort of the last, My pity's child, and by the first matur'd, Amidst this flattering, fatal æra rose; Rose into being, to perfection rose, Beneath my humble fostering; and at length Grown into public favour, thou shalt live; And endless good diffuse, when sleeps in dust Thy hapless founder now, by direst fate, Lock'd in a prison, whence thy bounty sets, And shall—oh comfort—long set thousands free. Happy, thrice happy, had my active zeal,— Already deem'd too active chance, by some, Whose frozen hearts, in icy fetters bound Of sordid selfishness, ne'er felt the warmth, The genial warmth of pure benevolence, Love's ardent flame aspiring;—had that flame Kindled my glowing zeal into effect, And to thy counterpart He intended to have established a “Charity for the Loan of Money, without interest, to industrious tradesmen.” Necessary papers for that end were collected from Dublin, &amp;c. and the following address, which he wrote and inserted in the Public Ledger of the 1st January, 1776, will, in some measure, explain his purpose: To the Wealthy in the Commercial World. I HAVE often wished most sincerely to see a charitable fund established in this great and trading city, for the beneficent purpose of “lending to honest and industrious Tradesmen “small sums without interest, and on a reasonable security.” The benefits which would arise from such an establishment are too obvious to need enumeration. Almost every newspaper tends more and more to convince me of the necessity of such a plan; for in almost every news-paper we read Advertisements from Tradesmen, soliciting little sums in their distress; and offering—poor unhappy men! even premiums for those little sums. It is not possible but that persons occupied in trade and commerce must feel for the difficulties of their brethren, and be ready to promote the undertaking I would wish to recommend, although on no interested motives;—for I am no tradesman, nor can any way be benefitted by the plan. Pure good-will, and a compassionate respect to the hardships and distresses of my fellow-creatures actuate my heart: And from these motives, I shall be happy to proceed upon, and prosecute this plan, with all the efforts and assiduity I am able, if it shall be approved by the benevolent, and they will testify that approbation, and desire of concurrence, by a line directed to D. at Anderton's Coffee house, Fleet-street. In consequence of which, should a probability of success appear, a meeting shall speedily be advertised in the papers, and all measures pursued to put the good design into immediate execution, which on such a meeting may be judged adviseable. It may be proper just to observe, that in many cities abroad,—at Rome in particular,—there are institutions of this sort: and there has been one established for many years at Dublin, which is found productive of the happiest consequences. It is made in scripture one characteristic of the good man, “that he is merciful and lendeth:” and a very small sum, thus given to a permanent establishment, may enable a man to lend for perpetuity! How can we better begin the new year, my worthy and humane countrymen, than by entering on a work, which may draw down upon us God's blessing, by our charitable relief to many sons and daughters of honest and laborious industry?— Humanity. existence giv'n, Lov'd institution; with its guardian aid Protecting from the prison's ruinous doors, Those whom thy kindly mercy rescues thence! Or, had that zeal, on firm foundation fix'd Like thine my favourite Magdalen,—the plan, Preservative of tender female fame “A plan for a National Female Seminary”—since found amongst the Author's papers; and which appears to have undergone the inspection, and received the approbation of some very distinguished names., Fair innocence and virtue, from those ills Destructive, complicate, which only find Relief beneath thy hospitable roof, How had I died exulting!—But, oh raise, Inspire some godlike spirit, some great soul, Father of mercies, of all love, all good Author and finisher;—these, and every work Beneficent, with courage to pursue, With wisdom to complete! Oh crown his zeal; While sorrowing human nature, by his hand Cherish'd and sooth'd, to latest times shall tell, And bless with tears of gratitude his name! Mine is a different fate,—confess'd, just Judge, The meed of human mixture in my works Imperfect, frail; and needing, even the best, Thy pardon and the cleansing of thy blood, Else whence the frequent retributions base, Calumnious and ungrateful, for the deeds Of private pity? Whence, for public acts, The stab opprobrious, and the slanders vile? Or whence, at this dread moment,—from the sight Shrowd me in tenfold darkness!—Mercy, Heavens! And is it He—th'ingenuous youth, so oft Of all my being, fortune, comfort, deem'd The generous, ample source?—And is it He, In whom, thro' drear misfortune's darkest night, I saw Hope's day-star rising?—Angel of peace, Amidst his future hours, my life's sad loss, Let not accusing conscience to his charge Impute, distracting—to my crimson'd guilt Oh let him lay it, as the forfeit due, And justly paid!—Would Heaven that it were paid! Oh, that with Rome's first Cæsar, in my robe From sight so killing, mantled up mine eyes, I might receive the welcome stab; sigh forth, “My Philip, my lov'd Stanhope,—Is it thou? “—Then let me die.”— Yet, tho' thus wounded at this bar I stand In pangs unutterable, witness Heaven, With deep commiseration do I view Their sedulous anxiety to prove A guilt, my heart,—too wounded to deny, Wounded by that guilt's sense, its bitterest part,— Instant avow'd. What need then all this toil? The deed is done. Wound not the fall'n hart,— 'Tis cruel—that lies bleeding at your feet: ‘I own the whole; I urge no legal plea. ‘On dire necessity's imperious call, ‘(Sons of the robe, of commerce, sons of men, ‘That call imperious have you never heard?) ‘On full intention to repay the whole. ‘And on that full intention's perfect work, ‘Free restoration and complete: on wrong ‘Or injury to none design'd or wrought, ‘I rest my claim;—I found my sole defence.’ “Groundless,—'tis thunder'd in my ears—and weak; “For in the rigid courts of human law, “No restitution wipes away th'offence, “Nor does intention justify.” So spoke (And who shall argue?) Judgment's awful voice! Haste then, ye weeping jurymen, and pass Th'awarded sentence. To the world, to fame, To honor, fortune, peace, and Stanhope lost, What have I more to lose? or can I think Death were an evil to a wretch like me! Yet, oh ye sons of justice!—ere we quit This awful court, expostulation's voice One moment hear impartial. Give a while Your honest hearts to nature's touches true, Her fine resentments faithful. Draw aside That veil from reason's clear reflecting view, Which practice long, and rectitude suppos'd Of laws establish'd, hath obstructive hung. But pleads or time, or long prescription aught In favour or abatement of the wrong By folly wrought, or error? Hoary grown, And sanctify'd by custom's habit grey, Absurdity stalks forth, still more absurd, And double shame reflects upon an age Wise and enlighten'd. Should not equal laws Their punishments proportionate to crimes Horace's precept must for ever stand forth as irrefragably just: ? “Adsit Regula! peccatis quæ pœnas irroget æquas: Ne Scutica dignum horribili sectêre flagello.” Sat. 3. Lib. 1.; Nor, all Draconic, ev'n to blood pursue Vindictive, where the venial poor offence Cries loud for mercy? Death's the last demand Law can exact: the penalty extreme Of human crime! and shall the petty thief Succumb beneath its terrors, when no more Pays the bold murderer, crimson'd o'er with guilt? Few are the crimes against or God or man, —Consult th'eternal code of right or wrong,— Which e'er can justify this last extreme “He had sometimes expressed his thoughts about our penal laws, that they were too sanguinary;—that they were against not only the laws of God, but of nature;—that his own case was hard, that he should die for an act which he always declared to be wrong, but by which he never intended to injure any one individual; and that, as the public had forgiven him, he thought he might have been pardoned. But now (the day before his execution) he laid all these thoughts touching himself aside, though he continued to think in the same manner of the penal laws to his end.” See the Ordinary's account.’, This wanton sporting with the human life, This trade in blood. Ye sages, then, review, Speedy and diligent, the penal code, Humanity's disgrace; our nation's first And just reproach, amidst its vaunted boasts Of equity and mercy:—Shiver not Full oft your inmost souls, when from the bench Ye deal out death tremendous; and proclaim Th'irrevocable sentence on a wretch Pluck'd early from the paths of social life, And immature, to the low grave consign'd For misdemeanors trivial!

Of reason more, Religion, duty, eminence, dream not: The door of mercy's clos'd. Thee—oft from thee Mercy, sweet Heaven, have I sought and found; From fellow-mortals seldom could I find, How humbled e'er, or penitent, for faults! —And who of erring mortals faultless breathes? Mercy that gift of thine, which most adorns The judge's vestment, and the monarch's crown. Adieu, then, to its hope; its earthly hope, Elsewhere we'll seek it. Forth—oh forth, my friends; My generous, supporting, weeping friends, Forth from the bar conduct me. It is past. Justice has done her office. Mercy's fled; And smiling, lo! she sits upon a cloud Of fleecy whiteness, ting'd with azur'd gold, And beams ineffable composure on me! Light sits my bosom'd master on his throne; Airy and disencumber'd feels my soul; And, panting, wishes to spring instant up To that white cloud,—the golden vehicle To realms of rest immortal! In my eyes, So languid late, and all suffus'd with tears, Methinks I see hope's lamp rekindled bright; A living lustre; shedding like the sun, After thick mists, Illumination's smile O'er all my countenance, marr'd, dimm'd, and wan. Cheerly, my friends, oh cheerly! Look not thus With pity's melting softness! That alone Can shake my fortitude. All is not lost. Lo! I have gain'd, on this important day A victory consummate o'er my self, And o'er this life a victory. On this day,— My birth-day to eternity—I've gain'd Dismission from a world, where for a while, Like you, like all, a pilgrim passing poor, A traveller, a stranger, I have met But stranger treatment, rude and harsh! So much The dearer, more desir'd, the home I seek Eternal of my Father and my God! Ah, little thought ye, prosecutors prompt, To do me good like this! little intend For earthly poverty to give th'exchange Of wealth eternal! Cheronea's sage, Thy dogmas here, so paradoxal deem'd By weak half-thinkers See Plutarch “On the benefits deducible from enemies.” Morals, vol. 1.—see, how amply prov'd, How verisify'd by men I judg'd my foes;— Friends in disguise, Heaven's instruments of good! Freely, triumphantly, my soul forgives Each injury, each evil they have wrought, Each tear they've drawn, each groan they've cost my heart, Guiltless tow'rds them, uninjur'd. Hapless men! Down do I look, with pity: fervent beg, And unremitting from all-gracious Heaven Eternal blessings on you! Be your lives, Like mine, true convertites to grace, to God! And be your deaths,—ah, there all difference ends— Then be our deaths like his, th'atoning just; Like his, the only righteous, our last end! But oh, oblivious memory! baneful woe, Which thus in dull forgetfulness can steep My faculties;—forgetfulness of her My better self, for whom alone I wish, Thus fall'n, to remember that I am! My wife, my soul's dear partner in distress, Where sits she? lives she? Ah not lives, but drags The tedious, torturing, horrid, anxious hours Of this dire day!—In solemn silence wrapt, —Expressive silence motionless, compos'd, The melancholy mourner meekly waits The awful issue! From her lovely eyes Drops not a tear! not ev'n a sigh is heard From her deep-wounded heart: Nor through her lips, Unsever'd from the luckless morn till night, Mute sufferer, steals a murmur “I speechless sat;—nor plaintive word, “Nor murmur, from my lips was heard.” Merrick's Psalms, p. 39! Gentle dove, So, in the mournful absence of thy mate, Perhaps or levell'd by the fowler's art, Or lur'd in net insidious, sittest thou alone Upon the bared bough; thy little head Nestling beneath thy silvery wings; while hang Thy pennons, late so glossy, shivering down Unplum'd, neglected, drooping! Thro' the day So tried, my tender friends,—another task, And heavier yet, remains to be perform'd. Oh, with the balm of comfort, with the voice Of soothing softness, the sad truth unfold! Approach the beauteous mourner, all-rever'd; And tell her, “that her husband triumphs, lives;— “Lives tho' condemn'd; lives to a nobler life! “Nor, in the gladsome view of that high life, “Feels he to death reluctance: Blest with her, “Indifferent in his choice to live or die!” Be the decision, thine, Father of life! Thou gavest, thou hast right to take away; In each alike beneficent! If thou Hast pleasure in me, once more shall I share Thy hallow'd services, my heart's chief joy; If not with happy David—oh like his Could my song flow repentant—every thought Uniting cries with resignation's voice, “Do with me, Lord, as it shall seem Thee good 2 Sam. xv. 25, 26.!” Thus supplicating, down my weary head To slumber on its wretched pillow sunk, O'erpower'd, oppress'd. Nor on the main-mast high Rock'd by the bellowing tempest, and the dash Of furious surges, the poor ship-boy sleeps More soundly, than my powers o'erwrought, amidst The din of desperate felons, and the roar Of harden'd guilt's mad midnight orgies loud! But, fancy free, the busy soul was wake; Anticipation pleasing of its state, When sleeps its clayey prison in the grave, And forth it bursts to liberty! Methought —Such was the vision—in a lowly vale Myself I found, whose living green was deck'd With all the beauteous family of Spring; Pale primrose, modest violet, hare-bell blue, Sweet-scented eglantine of fragrance rich, And permanent the rose: golden jonquil, And polyanthus variegate of hue, With lilies dale-delighting. Thro' the midst Meandering of pure crystal flow'd a stream The flowery banks reflecting: On each side, With homely cots adorn'd, whose 'habitants, When sorrow-sunk, my voice of comfort sooth'd; When sickness-worn, my hand of care reliev'd, Tended, and, ministering to all their wants, Instructed in the language of the skies. Dear was the office, cheering was the toil, And something like angelic felt my soul! When lur'd, methought, by one of glittering hue (Bright gleam'd the coronet upon his brow, Rich glow'd his robe of crimson, ermine deck'd) I toil'd to gain a neighbouring mountain's top, Where blaz'd preferment's temple. So my guide With smile complacent taught and led me on, Softening with artful speech the tedious way, And arduous ever. As I rose, the view Still gloomier seem'd, and dreary; the strait path Still straiter, and more sharp the pointed briars Entangling! With insulting sneers the crowd, Pressing the same bad road, jostled me by, Or threw me prostrate: till fatigued and faint, With feeble voice, exhausted quite, I cried, “Oh to my vale restore me! to my cots, “Illustrious guide! my ministrations blest, “Angelical and blessing!”—With a look Of killing scorn he eyed me: Instant down, Precipitate dash'd o'er me craggy rocks, Tumbling tumultuous; and in dungeon dark, Illumin'd only by the furious glare Of lynx and tygers eyes, thro' hunger fierce, And eager to devour, trembling I lay! When, in a moment, thro' the dungeon's gloom Burst light resplendent as the mid-day sun, From adamantine shield of Heavenly proof, Held high by one Faith., of more than human port, Advancing slow; while on his tow'ring crest Sat fortitude unshaken: At his feet Crouch'd the half-famish'd savages! From earth He rais'd me, weeping, and with look of peace Benignant, pointed to a crimson cross On his bright shield pourtray'd. A milder form, Yet of celestial sweetness,—such as oft My raptur'd eyes have in the tablet trac'd Of unaffected penitence; of her Pleasing similitude—the weeping fair Early from royal, but unhallow'd love, To God's sole service flying Madame de la Valiere. This fine picture is in the Chapel of the Carmelite Nuns at Paris.—Fam'd Le Brun, Thy glowing pencil's master-piece!—Such seem'd Repentance, meek approaching. From the den, Illumin'd and defended by faith's shield, My trembling feet she led; and having borne Thro' perils infinite, and terrors wild And various,—fainting almost my sick soul— She left me at a gate of glittering gold, Which open'd instantaneous at the touch Of homely porter Humility., clad in wolsey grey; And ever bending lowly to the ground His modest countenance! But what a scene —Admitted thro' the portal—on my sight Transported, rush'd! High on a sapphire throne, Amidst a flame like carbuncle, sat Love, Beaming forth living rays of light and joy On choral crowds of spirits infinite, In immortality and glory cloth'd; And hymning lofty strains to minstrelsy Of golden harps accorded, in his praise, Love, uncreate, essential; Love, which bled; Which bleeding blanch'd to purest white their robes, And with eternal gold adorn'd their brows! Dissolv'd, methought, and all my senses rapt In vision beatific, to a bank Of purple amaranthus was I borne By a superior genius. His white wings Distilling panacea, dove-like spread Refreshing fragrance o'er me: Firm of brow And masculine he seem'd—th'ennobling power Angelic, destin'd in the human heart To nourish friendship's flame! Uprais'd my eyes As from a trance returning—“Spirit belov'd, “And honour'd ever!” anxious strait I cried, “Thrice welcome to my wishes! Oh impart— “For you can tell—in these delightful realms “Of happiness supernal, shall we know,— “Say, shall we meet and know those dearest friends, “Those tender relatives, to whose concerns “You minister appointed? Shall we meet “In mutual amity? mutual converse hold, “And live in love immortal?—Oh relieve “My aching heart's solicitude; and say, “Here shall I meet, here know, in boundless bliss, “Here view transported, her, my life's best friend, “My sorrows faithful soother!”—Gushing tears Impetuous stopp'd my voice; and I awoke To earth, to night, to darkness, and a jail! April 14, 1777. END OF THE FOURTH WEEK. WEEK THE FIFTH. Futurity. “To death devote!” Thus in the vernal bloom Of redolent youth and beauty, on the cross Hung high her motto Miss Mary Bosanquet, whose motto, encircling a cross, is, “Devoted to Death.” From fourteen years of age she dedicated herself to sincere religion, and to the present hour has persevered in the most exemplary line of duty. Her letters to the author, in his last distress, afforded him peculiar comfort.;—she, in name and choice Of that far better part, like her so fam'd In story evangelical,—Sweet saint, Friend of my soul, and soother of my grief, Shall I then dread in age, and worn with woe, To meet the king of terrors?—Coward fear Of what we all must meet: The primal curse Of our first father rests on all his race, And “Dust to dust,” the charter of mankind! But, were it possible, oh! who would wish To stretch the narrow span, grown tedious, stale, With dull recurrence of the same dull acts, Ev'n in its happiest state! A toilsome care, A wearying round of clothing, food, and sleep: While chequer'd over with a thousand ills Inevitably painful!—In our frame Dwell (death's artillery) diseases dire, And potent to dislodge the brittle life With agonies heart-rending! In the soul Lurks sin, the serpent, with her fiery sting Of sorrow, rankling in the conscience deep, Source of all mental misery!—From without, In close battalion, a black troop of ills Level their deep-drawn arrows at our peace; And fail not, as we pass thro' life's bad road, To wound th'unguarded traveller! witness you Who groan distress'd beneath oppression's scourge; Ingratitude's sharp tooth; the canker'd tongue Of slander; fortune's loss; or, bitterer far, The loss of fame, and soul-connected friends! Thus tax'd, thus wretched, can the man be wise Who wishes to retain so poor a boon? Who fears to render the deposit up To his blest hands who gave it? And who thus love Beneficent hath rang'd his moral plan, Thus good with evil mix'd; from earth's poor (School of probation) suffering man to wean, And raise his hopes to heaven! Silence then The whisper of complaint; low in the dust Dissatisfaction's dæmons growl unheard! All, all is good, all excellent below: Pain is a blessing; sorrow leads to joy, Joy permanent and solid! Every ill Bears with it love paternal: nay, ev'n death, Grim death itself, in all its horrors clad, Is man's supremest privilege! It frees The soul from prison, from foul sin, from woe, And gives it back to glory, rest, and God! When will its welcome message lay at peace My burden'd, beating heart?—Oh strange! to point Thy darts, inexorable tyrant, there, Where life laughs crown'd with roses; when these arms, Familiar to thy sister Sorrow's fold. Would so delighted hug thee! But thou lov'st Full oft the noblest quarry, highest aim: Lov'st, unsuspected, and with silent step, To steal on the secure: Lov'st to deal round Tremendous and impartial thy stern strokes, Asserting terrible o'er human-kind Thy empire irresistible: And now At monarchs, now at mimics, grinning scorn, Thy hand indifferent hurls the twanging shaft. Ah, what a groupe of primest deer lie pierc'd, Thou Hunter all-victorious, at thy feet; Since to thy empire dedicate I fell From life's bright hope, and languish'd in this grave, This living, doleful sepulchre immur'd!

Ensigns blest, When worn with sanctity; then surely chang'd For crown of gold, and robe of spotless white! See, neither can the coronet, nor garb Of ermin'd pomp, from Temple Countess of Temple. turn aside The level'd blow; nor, higher far in price, Th'uplifted shield of Janssen's honest heart! Lo! too, as if in scorn of purpled pride, And all life's glories, in this high parade Funereal marches, tragic-actor now He who so late light on the comic sock Trod the gay stage, and bade with laughter's burst Involuntary the throng'd theatres resound! Ah, food for worms, poor Woodward, thou, no less Than patriots, princes, countesses and priests! Death scorns distinctions: But, despotic power, Cloth'd in his direst terrors, here he reigns, Here revels! Here, with bitterest vengeance, shakes O'er trembling convicts his determin'd shaft, And gluts himself with horror! See him lead From yonder darksome cell, all pale with woe, That stranger Alluding to Tolosa, a poor unhappy Spaniard, lately executed for the murder of his female friend. He took scarce any sustenance from the time of the fact, and was more than half dead when conveyed to the place of execution. sinking! who, in luckless hour, With rash hand pierc'd the bosom he ador'd, Nor drank of comfort more! half in his heart The black lance festering sticks; and death himself, Howe'er relentless, ere he drives it home, Of strange commiseration feels a pang, Reluctant to his office!— But, that shriek— Thrilling with dread—whence is it? 'Tis the voice Of female misery, bursting thro' the crowd To the lone dungeon: view that lovely form This also alludes to a miserable catastrophe, which happened here on the morning of a late execution. The poor young woman who came to visit her husband, had lain-in but seven days. As soon as the husband's fetters were knocked off, he stepped aside, and cut his throat in a dismal manner; but not quite sufficiently to finish his existence:—And in that shocking state—paid his debt—at the destined place. Deck'd in the neatest white,—yet not so white And wan as her wild visage: “Keep me not,” Raving she cries, “Keep me not, cruel, from him. “He dies this morn; I know it: he's condemn'd; “The dreadful judge has done it! He must die, “My husband! and I'm come, clad in my best, “To go and suffer with him! I have brought “Sweet flowers to cheer him, and to strew his corse, “Pale, pale, and speechless lies it!—Husband, come! “The little infant, fruit of our glad loves, “Smil'd on me, as with parting breath I blest, “And kiss'd the dear babe for thee! 'Tis but young; “'Tis tender yet;—seven days is young in life: “Angels will guard my little innocent: “They'll feed it, tho' thou could'st not find it food, “And its poor mother too!—And so thou dy'st! “For me and it thou dy'st! But not alone, “Thou shalt not go alone; I will die with thee: “Sweet mercy be upon us! Hence, hence, hence!” Impetuous then, her white arms round his neck She threw; and, with deep groans would pierce a rock, Sunk fainting. Oh the husband's, father's pangs, Stopping all utterance! Up to Heaven he roll'd His frantic eyes; and staring wildly round In desperation's madness, to his heart Drove the destructive steel!—Fell death, Would'st thou a fuller triumph?—Oh my wife, How dismal to our ears the shrieks, the groans!— And what a crowd of wild ideas press Distracting on the soul! “Merciful Heaven, “In pity spare us! Say, It is enough, “And bid the avenging angel stay his hand!” Death bars the plea; and with his thundering stalk Brushing beside us, calls, in solemn sound, Heed to his dart grief-pointed. Its keen stroke, Ah gentle Eleonora Mrs. Dodd's sister; who, in the midst of our sorrows, did—what she never did before—augment them, by dying of a heart broken with grief for our calamity. Oh misery!! gives at once Relief to thy o'er-burden'd breast! to ours Anguish unutterable! 'Tis ours he wounds, Thou amiable friend!—whose languid eye Ne'er rais'd a look from earth since that sad hour When sunk my sun! Thou, who from earliest youth Hast humbly sought thy God, thou art at peace: Happy, thrice happy, on that golden shore, Where from the tossing of these troublous waves We soon shall land. Oh stay, affectionate, Oh wait, and welcome us! Or, if in Heaven Blest saints retain concern for those on earth Held in the dearest amity, become Thy darling sister's guardian! As from youth, From childhood's dawn, her dear maternal guide, Be now, lov'd spirit, in this hour of woe Her angel-comfort, her support! Alas, What talk I of support! thou mercy's God! When all her conduct, by the grace inspir'd— When all her patient gentleness and love, Her fortitude unparallel'd, and peace, Have thee their Author: Be the glory thine! But say, my soul, 'midst these alarming calls, This dread familiarity with death; Our common debt, from infancy's first cry Denounc'd, expected, tho' its sure approach Lurks in uncertainty's obscurest night;— Our common debt, which babes and palsied seers, Princes and pilgrims, equally must pay;— Say, canst thou feel reluctance to discharge The claim inevitable? Senseless he, Who in life's gaudiest moments fondly strives To turn his eyes unheeding from the view Instructive. 'Midst those moments, deep it dwelt On my reflecting mind Reflections on Death—Thoughts on Epiphany—Sermon on Mutual Knowledge, &amp;c.! a mind which liv'd More in the future than the present world; Which, frequent call'd by duty's solemn voice From earth's low scenes, on those sublimer far Hath ever thought delighted; and those thoughts Conveying to mankind, in them desires Its real transcript, its resemblance true May be survey'd—the picture of itself. For, whatsoe'er may be our earthly state, The mind's the man. My humble labours, then, When rests my part corporeal in the dust, Hang up my living portrait!—And to give Those labours all their force, summon'd I stand By awful Providence, to realize The theoretic lessons I have taught. And lo! compos'd, I fix my dying seal In attestation to their truth, their power, Felt at my heart, my inmost conscience felt; Imparting triumph o'er life's love; o'er death Consummate exultation! while my soul Longs to go forth, and pants for endless day! But who can wonder, that amidst the woes, Like a swoln torrent, which with frightful roar Have burst destructive o'er me; 'midst the loss Of all things dear, Fame, Honour, Peace, and Rest; Amidst the cruel spoiling of my goods, The bitterest rancour of envenom'd spite, And calumny unfeeling Numberless letters, of a most unchristian, horrid, and cruel nature, were continually sent to him in the height of his distresses. Yet some of these letters were subscribed, A Lady, A Christian, or, A Christian Brother.;—what surprize That my wean'd soul, above this worldly wreck, With anxious expectation waits the call From melancholy mourning and dim grief, To everlasting gladness? Powerful Hope, And all-sufficient to sustain the soul, Tho' walking thro' the darkest vale of woe! Who shall disprove that Hope? or who pretend By subtle sophistry that soul to rob Of its chief anchor, choicest privilege, And noblest consolation—“Stedfast Faith “In great Futurity's extended scene: “Eternity of Being?” All things round Arise in brightest proof: I see it, feel it, Thro' all my faculties, thro' all my powers, Pervading irresistible. Each groan Sent from my sorrowing heart; each scalding tear From my convicted eyes; each fervent prayer By meek repentance offer'd up to Heaven, Asserts my immortality! proclaims A pardoning Deity and future world. Nor less the thought, chill, comfortless, abhorr'd, Of loath'd annihilation!—From the view, Humiliating, mean, unworthy man, Almost unworthy reptiles,—glad I turn, And triumph in existence! Nay, each ill And every mundane trouble preaches loud The same important truth. I read it fair And legibly engrav'd on all below: On all the inequalities discern'd In this perplexing, mix'd, and motley scene; In every rank and order of mankind See Macleane's Answer to Jenyns, &amp;c. p. 52.; Nay, in the wisest system of our laws, Inadequate, imperfect,—and full oft Unjust and cruel; in this dismal jail, And in the proudest palaces alike I read, and glory to trace out the marks Irrefragably clear of future life; Of retribution's just and equal state. So Reason urges; while fair Nature's self, At this sweet season Spring. See my Poem on the Epiphany, ver. 131, &amp;c. I would have that Poem considered, in dependence with this, as my serious thoughts on these awful subjects, in an early period of my life; and which, in this last and dreadful one, I find no reason to alter., joyfully throws in Her attestation lovely: bids the sun, All-bounteous, pour his vivifying light, To rouse and waken from their wint'ry death The vegetable tribe! Fresh from their graves, At his resistless summons, start they forth, A verdant resurrection! In each plant, Each flower, each tree to blooming life restor'd, I trace the pledge, the earnest, and the type Of man's revival; of his future rise And victory o'er the grave,—compell'd to yield Her sacred, rich deposit, from the seed Corrupt and mortal, and immortal frame Glorious and incorruptible; like his, The Sun of righteousness, whose living power The mighty work shall operate! Yes, bright source Of spiritual life!—the immaterial world Pervading, quickening, gladdening,—in the rays Full-orb'd of Revelation, thy prime gift, I view display'd, magnificent, and full, What reason, nature, in dim darkness teach, Tho' visible, not distinct: I read with joy Man's high prerogative; transported read The certain, clear discovery of life And immortality, announc'd by thee, Parent of truth, celestial Visitant, Fountain of all intelligence divine! Of that high immortality the King, And of that life the Author! How man mounts, Mounts upon angel-wings, when fies'd, secur'd In that sublime inheritance; when seen As a terrestrial stranger here; a god Confin'd a while in prison of the flesh, Soon, soon to soar, and meet his brother-gods, His fellows, in eternity!—How creeps, How grovels human nature! What a worm, An insect of an hour, poor, sinful, sad; Despis'd and despicable, reptile-like Crawls man, his moment on his ant hill here: —Marking his little shining path with slime,— If limited to earth's brief round His painful, narrow views! Like the poor moth, By lights delusive to destruction led; Still struggling oft its horrors to evade, Still more and more involv'd; in flame he lives His transient toilsome minute, and expires In suffocating smoke. Hume, thou art gone! Amidst the catalogue of those mow'd down By time's huge scythe, late noted See Mr. Hume's Life, written by himself; with a letter by Dr. Smith, giving an account of his Death.; Thou, be sure, Wast not forgotten! Author thou hast gain'd Thy vast ambition's summit: Fame was thine; Wealth too, beyond thy amplest wish's bound, Encompass'd thee: And lo, the pageant ends! For who, without compassion's generous tear, Thy mind at once capacious and humane, Can view, to truth, to hope immortal dead? Thy penetrating reason, subtile, strong, Hoodwink'd by dark infatuation's veil; And all thy fine and manly sense employ'd, Ev'n on eternity's thrice awful verge, To trifle with the wonders of a state Respectably alarming! of a state Whose being gives to man—had given to thee (Accepted by the humble hand of faith) True glory, solid fame, and boundless wealth! Treasures that wax not old. Oh the high blessings of humility! Man's first and richest grace! Of virtue, truth, Knowledge, and exaltation, certain source, And most abundant: Pregnant of all good; And, poor in shew, to treasures infinite Infallibly conducting; her sure gift! So, when old Hyems has deform'd the year, We view, on fam'd Burgundia's craggy cliffs, The slow vines, scarce distinct, on the brown earth Neglected lie and grovelling;—promise poor, From plant so humble, of the swelling grape In glowing clusters purpling o'er the hills:— When all impregnating rolls forth the sun, And from the mean stalk pours a luscious flood Of juice nectareous thro' the laughing land! Nervous essayist! haply had thy pen, Of masculine ability, this theme Pursued intelligent; from lowly heart Delineating true the features mild Of genuine humility; mankind, Now 'wilder'd by thy sophistry, had bless'd And honour'd well thy teaching: Whilst thyself Secure had sail'd and happy, nor been cast On pride's black rocks, or empty scorn's bleak shore! Proud scorn, how poor and blind—how it at once Destroys the sight, and makes us think we see! While desperate ridicule in wit's wild hands Implants a dangerous weapon! How it warps From clear discernment, and conclusions just, Ev'n captive reason's self! How gay soe'er— (Ah misplac'd gaiety on such a theme) In life's last hour!—on Charon's crazy bark, On Tartarus and Elysium, and the pomp Solemn and dreaded of dark pagans Hell! Thy reasoning powers knew well, full well to draw Deductions true from fables gross as these, By poets fancy heighten'd! Well thou knew'st The deep intelligence, the solid truth Conceal'd beneath the mystic tale; well knew'st Fables like these, familiar to mankind In every nation, every clime, through earth Widely disseminate, through earth proclaim'd In language strong, intelligent and clear, “A future state retributive:” Thou knew'st, That in each age the wife embrac'd the truth, And gloried in an hope, how dim soe'er, Which thou, amidst the blaze, the noon-day blaze Of christian information, madly scorn'dst And diedst insulting! Hail of ancient times, Worthies and fam'd believers! Plato, hail! And thou, immortal Socrates, of Rome Prime ornament and boast! my Tully, hail; Friend and companion of my studious life, In eloquence and sound philosophy Alike superlative!—with minds enlarg'd, Yet teachable and modest, how ye sought, You and your kindred souls,—how daily dug For wisdom as the labourer in the mines! How grop'd, in fancy's and dark fable's night, Your way assiduous, painful! How discern'd By the mind's trembling, unassisted light,— (Or, haply, aided by a scatter'd ray Of distant revelation, half extinct) The glimmer of a dawn; the twinkling star Of day-light far remote! How sigh'd sincere For fuller information! and how long'd, How panted for admission to that world O'er which hung veils impervious! Sages, yes, Your search ingenuous proves it: every page Immortal of your writings speaks this truth! Hear, ye minute philosophers; ye herd Of mean half-thinkers, who chief glory place In boldness to arraign and judge your God, And think that singularity is sense! Hear, and be humbled: Socrates himself Alluding to his celebrated wish of divine illumination from some superior power.— And him you boast your master,—would have fall'n In humble, thankful reverence at the feet Of Jesus—and drank wisdom from his tongue! Divinest Fountain! from the copious stream Then drink we freely, gladly, plenteous draughts Of ever-living wisdom; knowledge clear, And otherwise attainless of that state Supernal, glorious; where, in angel-form And angel-blessedness ?????????., from Death's dread pow'r, From Sin's dominion, and from Sorrow's sense Emancipated ever, we shall share Complete uninterrupted, boundless bliss; Incessant flowing forth from God's right hand, Well of perennial joy See Psalm xiv. 12.! Our moral powers, By perfect pure benevolence enlarg'd, With universal sympathy, shall glow Love's flame ethereal! And from God himself, Love's primal source, and ever-blessing sun, Receive, and round communicate the warmth Of gladness and of glory! Then shall rule, From dregs of sordid interest defecate, Immortal friendship. Then too shall we trace— With minds congenial and athirst for truth Sincere and simple, the Creator's works, Illumin'd by the intellectual soul, Refin'd, exalted!—Animating thought! To talk with Plato, or with Newton tread Thro' empyrean space the boundless track Of stars erratic, or the comet vague With fiery lustre wandering thro' the depths Of the blue void, exhaustless, infinite; While all its wonders, all its mystic use, Expand themselves to the admiring sight! Descending then from the celestial range Of planetary worlds, how blest to walk And trace with thee, nature's true lover, Hale, —In science sage and venerable—trace Thro' vegetation's principle, the God! Read in each tube, capillary, and root, In every leaf and blossom, fruit and flower, Creative energy, consummate art, Beauty and bounty blended and complete! Oh what a burst of wisdom and delight, Intelligence and pleasure, to engage Th'enraptur'd mind for ages! 'Twere too short Eternity itself, with reasoning quest To search, to contemplate great nature's God Thro' all his nature's works! Suns, stars, and skies, With all their vast and elemental store: Seas, with their finny myriads: birds that wing With glittering pinions the elastic air, And fill the woods with music: Animals, That feed, that clothe, that labour for their lord, Proud man; and half up to his reason climb By instinct marvellous! Fruits, that infinite In glow and taste refresh creation's toil; And flowers, that rich in scent their incense sweet —Delicious offering both to God and man,— Breathe free from velvet variegated hues, And speak celestial kindness then from these His lesser wonders—Fam'd anatomists, Ye, who with scrupulous, but still painful search, Pore doubtful in the dark recess of life;— Then turn we, Cheselden, to man; so form'd With fear and wonder by the master-hand, And learn we, from discovery of the springs Of this divine automaton: the blood In nimble currents coursing thro' the veins And purple arteries; the fibres fine; The tubal nerves, so ramified, and quick To keen sensation; all the various parts So complicate, yet distinct; adapted each Its functions with minuteness to fulfil, While to the one great end concuring all With harmony unvarying!—Learn we hence The wisdom exquisite, which gave to life, To motion, this his prime, his chief machine! And superadded, in his love's display, The soul's superior, intellectual rule, Connection wonderful! and till that hour Of all-expanding knowledge, to man's mind Inexplicable still, and still unknown! How rise upon the thought, to truth attent, Truths new and interesting, 'midst this field Of universal science!—Nor shall then The spirit's seat and influence on our frame, Gross and material, be alone evolv'd To our astonish'd view. Spirit itself, Its nature, properties, distinctions, powers, —Deep subject of investigation deep, And chief resolver of man's anxious doubts; Tho' to his sight impossible, or search, While darken'd by mortality—shall rise, Soon as he bursts the barrier of the grave, Clear and familiar on his sight enlarg'd: Seen in himself, beatify'd, and cloth'd With spiritual glory: in the angelic world Seen and admir'd. And—oh ecstatic view, Whose sight is perfect bliss, transforming, pure There must be sympathy in the future state, to render it uniformly complete and perfect. We can have no pleasure in God, or God in us, but from that sympathy arising from similitude. We must be made like God to enjoy beatific vision. Bring a bad man to Heaven, with a soul encrusted and sensualized, he would have no pleasure in it; nor could he endure the sight, any more than reptiles that grovel in a cave amidst filth and darkness, could endure the splendors of the mid-day fun. Shakespeare's description is, in this view, highly animated: “For Vice, tho' to a radiant Angel link'd, “Would sate itself in a celestial bed, “And prey on garbage.”,— Seen and ador'd in Thee, great first and last, Sole, self-existent Thou the gracious cause Of all existence; Infinitely blest, Yet pleas'd with life and being to impart That blessing to innumerous creatures round! Spirit of the universe, thro' all diffus'd, And animating all! Dread Triune God See Macleane's Answer to Jenyns, p. 72., With beams exhaustless of eternal love, Of life, of glory, from thy central throne Shining beneficent: and kindling warm In every being subject to thy rule, Devotion's rapture and thanksgiving's song; Mellifluous songs, and hallelujahs high! New wonders elevate! For not alone By contemplation up to nature's God From nature's works ascending, shall the soul Beatified receive in future bliss Accessions of delight through endless day:— Lo, what a scene, engaging and profound, Presents itself the darkening curtain drawn— From the high acts of Providence, display'd In one clear view consistent; in one end Important, grand, concentering: one design Superlatively gracious, through the whole Pursued invariably; even from the hour When pass'd the sentence on the serpent's head, To that thrice-awful moment, when the Son His victor-car o'er death and Hell shall drive Triumphant, and bolt fast the gates of time! Unroll'd the mystic volume, we behold In characters of wisdom strong pourtray'd The rise and fall of empires; in thy hand Omnipotent, or instruments of good, Or of thy justice punitive and dread Awful dispensers! There, of heroes, kings, Sages, and saints, of prophets and of priests, Thy distributions, difficult but wise, Discerning, shall we gratefully adore: And in the long, long chain of seeming chance, And accidents fortuitous, shall trace Omniscience all-combining, guiding all! No dispensations then will seem too hard, Through temporary ills to blissful life Leading, tho' labyrinthal! All will shine In open day: all, o'er the mighty plan, Discover Thee, with wisdom infinite Presiding glorious: All thy stedfast truth, And love paternal, manifest; while falls The prostrate world of spirits, angels, saints, In adoration's homage 'fore thy throne! Nor to our earth, or earth's poor confines bound: The soul dilated, glorified and free, On seraph's wings shall soar, and drink in glad, New draughts of high delight from each survey Of its Creator's kingdoms! Pleas'd shall pass From star to star; from planetary worlds, And systems far remote, to systems, worlds Remoter still, in boundless depths of space; Each peopled with its myriads: and shall learn The wise and strict dependence of the whole; Concatenation striking of thy works, All-perfect, mighty Master! Wonder-lost In the vast view of systems numberless, All regular, in one eternal round Of beauteous order rolling! All design'd With skill consummate, tending to one goal; And manifesting all, in characters Transparent as the diamond's brilliant blaze, Their Sovereign Ruler's unity of will, His all-efficient wisdom, and his love, In grace and glory infinite; the chain Connecting firm, and through its every link Transfusing life's ineffable delights! Oh goodness providential! sleepless care! Intent, as ever blest, to bless the whole! What plaudits from that whole are due, shall burst From full creation's universal choir! Then, oh transporting! shall the scheme profound, Heaven's labour, and of angels anxious thought Sublimest meditation;—then shall blaze In fullest glory on the race redeem'd, Redemption's boundless mercy! High in Heav'n, To millions blest, rejoicing in its grace, And hymning all its bounties, shall the cross, Thy cross, all-conquering Saviour, be display'd, While seraphs veil their glories, and while men, Thronging innumerable, prostrate fall Before thy feet, and to the bleeding Lamb Ascribe their free salvation!— 'Midst that throng Of spirits justified, and thro' thy blood Cleans'd, perfected, and blest, might I be found, To scenes so high exalted; to such views Ennobling brought, such intellect refin'd, Such light and love, such holiness and peace; Such spheres of science, and such realms of rest! Ah, how I'd scorn the passage strait of death, How doleful e'er and horrid! How I'd look With stedfastness unshaken through the grave, And smile o'er all its sadness! How I'd rise Exulting, great Forerunner, o'er the waves And bitterness of life! How, smiling, court Ev'n the fell hand of horror, to dismiss From earth, from darkness, my delighted soul To Heaven, to God, and everlasting day! Teacher of truth, blest Jesu!—On the throne Of majesty co-equal thou who sitt'st From all eternity in glory's blaze With thy Almighty Father! Thou, benign, From bosom of that Father hast brought down Intelligence to man of this blest state Consolatory, rational; and fraught With every good beyond the highest reach Of man's supreme conception! How shall then In equal language man his homage pay, Or grateful laud thy goodness! Sons of Greece, Or ye, who in old times, of sevenfold Nile, Proud Tyber, or the Ganges' sacred flood Religious drank, and to your dæmons dark Paid superstition's tribute;—tho' I trace Delighted, in your visions of the world Beyond the grave, your dreams of future life,— Proofs of that life's firm credence, of your faith In the soul's deathless nature;—yet with tears Of human pity, humbled o'er the sense Of human imbecility, I read Your futile fables, puerile and poor; To the soul's life, to virtue's godlike love Unanimating, useless; while illum'd By gospel-splendor,—else, no doubt, as dark And worthy pity—owns my heart rejoic'd, That gospel's eminence of wisdom, truth, And heavenly emanation, in its traits Of future life superlatively drawn! And who could paint that life, that scene describe Immortal, and all-glorious, from the view Of mortals shrouded ever,—save the Son, Who from eternity that life enjoyed; And came in condescension to reveal A glimpse of its perfection to mankind? Presumption vain and arrogant in man, To think of sketching with his weak, faint line, A scene so much above him! And behold That vain presumption punish'd as it ought, In Araby's Impostor, dark and lewd; Who dar'd, with temporary follies fraught, And low self-interest, stalking in the van Of mad ambition's route—to cheat his train, Deluded by his darings, with the hope Of sensual ravishment, and carnal joys Perpetual in the Paradise of God; Reserv'd—for sons of murder and of lust! Shame on the impious madness!—Nor less shame Must truth indignant dart on those who boast Exclusive Christianity; yet dare, Presumptuous, in their fancied penal fire To fetter the free soul, “till the foul sins “Done in its days of nature be purged out “And burn'd away See Hamlet.;” unless by lucky chance The oft-repeated mass, thro' potent gold,— All-sacred influence!—gain'd, unlocks the door Of dismal prison-house, and gives the soul Enfranchis'd, up to Peter's better care! Preposterous, weak delusion! strange reproach To Christian sapience, and to manly sense! But not to Christ's true gospel, and the code Of Revelation pure; before whose light, Resplendently informing, fables old Like these, and vain (of ignorance the birth, Or coinage sacerdotal, in an age Of gross Cimmerian darkness), growling hide Their ignominious heads: as birds of night, Reptiles, and beasts of prey before the sun, Mounting the misty hills, in splendor rob'd, And beaming all around refulgent day! Other, far other, from that luminous code Breaks on the rational, enlighten'd mind In perfect beauty that exalted state, Of whose high excellence our fight hath dar'd, How dim soe'er, to take an humble glimpse, And peep into its wonders!—But what tongue Of man in language adequate can tell, What mortal pencil worthily pourtray That excellence, those wonders—where nor death, Nor sin, nor pain shall enter ever;—where, Each ill excluded, every good shall reign; Where day shall ne'er decline; but ceaseless light —The Lamb's eternal lustre—blazing bless With salutary glory! where shall smile One spring unvarying; and glad nature teem Spontaneous with exuberance of bounty! Where, in immortal health, the frame sublim'd, Refin'd, exalted thro' the chymic grave, In union with the soul made perfect, pure, And to the likeness of its God transform'd, Shall find for every sense divine employ, Gratification ample, exquisite, Angelical, and holy: Chief in sight, In vision beatific of its God; In blest communion of his love; in praise, High choral praise, strung to the golden harp In unison eternal, with the throng, Thousands of thousands that surround the throne, And feel his praise, their glory, and their bliss! There too his works constant th'adoring soul Shall pleas'd investigate; and constant find Fresh well-spring of delight; there constant share The lov'd society and converse high Of all the good, the wise, the truly great Of every age and clime; with saints and seers Divine communication holding, rapt Perpetually in new and deep displays Of wisdom boundless, and of perfect love. Then too, oh joy! amidst this blaze of good, This consummation rich of highest bliss; Then shall we meet,—meet never more to part, Dear, dear, departed friends! and then enjoy Eternal amity. My parents then, My youth's companions See Thoughts on the Epiphany, ver. 331, &amp;c.!—From my moisten'd cheeks Dry the unworthy tear! Where art thou, Death? Is this a cause for mourning?—What a state Of happiness exalted lies before me! Lo, my bar'd bosom! Strike:—I court the blow: I long, I pant for everlasting day, For glory, immortality, and God! But, ah! why droops my soul? why o'er me thus Comes a chill cloud? Such triumph well besuits The faithful christian; thee had suited well, If haply persevering in the course, As first thy race exultingly began. But thou art fallen, fallen! Oh my heart, What dire compunction!—sunk in foul offence A prisoner, and condemn'd: an outcast vile; Bye-word and scorn of an indignant world, Who reprobate with horror thy ill deeds; Turn from thee loath'd, and to damnation just Assign, unpitying, thy devoted head, Loaded with every infamy! Dread God Of Justice and of Mercy! wilt thou too, In fearful indignation on my soul, My anguish'd soul, the door of pity close, And shut me from thee ever?—Lo! in dust, Humiliant, prostrate, weeping 'fore thy throne— Before thy cross, oh dying Friend of man, Friend of repentant sinners, I confess, And mourn my deep transgressions; as the sand Innumerous, as the glowing crimson red: With every aggravation, every guilt Accumulate and burden'd! Against light, 'Gainst love and clearest knowledge perpetrate? Stamp'd with ingratitude's most odious stain; Ingratitude to thee; whose favouring love Had bless'd me, had distinguish'd me with grace, With goodness far beyond my wish or worth! Ingratitude to man; whose partial ear Attended to my doctrine with delight; And from my zeal conspicuous justly claim'd Conspicious example!—Lord, I sink O'erwhelm'd with self-conviction, with dismay, With anguish and confusion past compare! And could I weep whole seas of briny tears In painful penitence; could I deplore From my heart's aching fountain, drop by drop, My crimes and follies; my deep grief and shame. For vile dishonour on thy gospel brought; For vile discredit to my order done; For deep offence against my country's laws! For deep offence to pity and to man,— A patriarchal age would be too short To speak my sorrows and lament my sins; Chief, as I am, of sinners! Guiltier far Than he who, falling, at the cock's shrill call Rose, and repented weeping: Guiltier far— I dare not say, than Judas; for my heart Hath ever lov'd,—could never have betray'd, Oh never, never Thee, dear Lord! to death; Tho' cruelly, unkindly and unwise That heart hath sacrific'd its truth and peace, —For what a shameful, what a paltry price!— To sin, detested sin; and done thee wrong, Oh blessed source of all its good, its hope! For, tho' thus sunk, thus sinful, sorrowing thus, It dare not, cannot Judas' crime commit, Last crime,—and of thy mercy, Lord despair! But, conscious of its guilt; contrite and plung'd In lowest self-abjection, in the depths Of sad compunction, of repentence due And undissembled, to thy cross it cleaves, And cries for—ardent cries for mercy, Lord! Mercy, its only refuge! Mercy, Christ! By the red drops that in the garden gush'd 'Midst thy soul's anguish from thee! By the drops That down thy precious temples from the crown Of agony distill'd! By those that flow'd From thy pierc'd hands and blessed feet so free; By all thy blood, thy sufferings, and thy death, Mercy, oh Mercy, Jesus! Mercy Thou, Who erst on David, with a clement eye, When mourning at thy footstool, deign'dst to look Thou, who th'adulterous Magdalen forgav'st, When in the winning garb of penitence Contrite she knelt, and with her flowing tears Wash'd lowly thy lov'd feet! Nor thou the thief, Ev'n in the last, the bitterest hour of pain, Refusedst, gracious! Nor wilt thou refuse My humble supplication, nor reject My broken bleeding heart, thus offer'd up On true contrition's altar; while thro' Thee, Only thro' Thee acceptance do I hope, Thou bleeding love! consummate Advocate, Prevailing Intercessor, great High Priest, Almighty Sufferer! Oh look pitying down! On thy sufficient merits I depend; From thy unbounded mercies I implore The look of pardon and the voice of grace,— Grace, Grace!—Victorious Conqueror over sin, O'er death, o'er Hell, for me, for all mankind; For grace I plead: repentant at thy feet I throw myself, unworthy, lost, undone; Trusting my soul, and all its dear concerns, With filial resignation to thy will: Grace,—still on grace my whole reliance built: Glory to grace triumphant!—And to thee, Dispenser bounteous of that sovereign grace! Jesus, thou King of glory! at thy call I come obedient: lo, the future world Expands its views transporting! Lord, I come; And in that world eternal trust to 'plaud, With all redemption's sons, thy glorious grace! Then farewell, oh, my friends! light o'er my grave The green sod lay, and dew it with the tear Of memory affectionate! and you —The curtain dropt decisive, oh my foes, Your rancour drop; and, candid, as I am Speak of me, hapless! Then you'll speak of one Whose bosom beat at pity's gentlest touch From earliest infancy: whose boyish mind In acts humane and tender ever joy'd; And who,—that temper by his inmost sense Approv'd and cultivate with constant care,— Melted thro' life at Sorrow's plaintive tale; And urg'd, compassionate with pleasure ran To soothe the sufferer and relieve the woe! Of one, who, though to humble fortune bred, With splendid generosity's bright form Too ardently enamour'd, turn'd his sight, Deluded, from frugality's just care, And parsimony needful! One who scorn'd Mean love of gold, yet to that power,—his scorn Retorting vengeful,—a mark'd victim fell! Of one, who, unsuspecting, and ill-form'd For the world's subtleties, his bare breast bore Unguarded, open; and ingenuous, thought All men ingenuous, frank and open too! Of one, who, warm with human passions, soft To tenderest impressions, frequent rush'd Precipitate into the tangling maze Of error;—instant to each fault alive Who, in his little journey through the world— Misled, deluded oft, mistook his way; Met with bad roads and robbers, for his steps Insidious lurking: and, by cunning craft Of fellow-travellers sometimes deceiv'd, Severely felt of cruelty and scorn, Of envy, malice, and of ill report The following is a striking instance, and an alarming proof, that calumny and slander will one day grievously afflict the conscious mind.—A clergyman, with whom I had lived in much friendship, always ready to shew him every proof of civility, and for whom I had much esteem; after an absence of a twelve-month and more, sent me a line, that he was then in a dangerous state, apprehensive of speedy death. I flew to my friend with all zeal and speed; and found him, as it seemed, in a very dangerous way. Almost as soon as he saw me he burst into tears, and clasping my hands vehemently, said, “Oh, my dear Doctor, I could not die in peace without seeing you, and earnestly imploring your pardon. For amidst all the seeming friendship I shewed, I have been your bitter enemy. I have done all I could on every occasion to traduce and lessen you: Envy, base envy alone, being my motive; for I could not bear the brilliancy of your reputation, and the splendor of your abilities.—Can you forgive me?” I was shocked; but with great truth told him to be perfectly at peace; that he had my most sincere forgiveness.—I did all I could to soothe his mind. He recovered; and surely must ever be my friend! Would to God what he then suffered may be a warning to him, and to all, how they indulge such diabolical passions; which, as being most opposite to the God who is love, cannot but sooner or later woefully distract the heart!, The heavy hand oppressive! One who brought —From ignorance, from indiscretion blind,— Ills numerous on his head; but never aim'd, Nor wish'd an ill or injury to man! Injur'd, with cheerful readiness forgave; Nor for a moment in his happy heart Harbour'd of malice or revenge a thought: Still glad and blest to avenge his foes despite By deeds of love benevolent!—Of one— Oh painful contradiction, who in God, In duty, plac'd the summit of his joy; Yet left that God, that blissful duty left, Preposterous, vile deserter! and receiv'd A just return—“Desertion from his God, “And consequential plunge into the depth “Of all his present—of all human woe!” Then hear his sufferings! Hear (if found too faint His feeble song to win attention) hear And heed his dying counsel! Cautious, shun The rocks on which he split. Cleave close to God, Your Father, sure Protector, and Defence: Forsake not his lov'd service; and your cause Be sure he'll ne'er forsake. Initiate once Happy and prosperous, in religion's course Oh persevere unfainting! Nor to vice Or tempting folly slightest parley give: Their black tents never enter: On the watch Continue unremitting, nor e'er slack The necessary guard. Trivial neglects, Smallest beginnings Principiis obsta: fero medicina paratur, Cum mala per longas convaluere moras. Sed propera; nec te venturas differ in horas. Quil non est hodie, cras minus aptus erit. Ov. R. A. lib., 1. L. 91., to the wakeful foe Open the door of danger;—and down sinks, Thro' the minutest leak once sprung, the ship In gayest and most gallant tackle trim. By small neglects he fell!— Oh could ye rise, Blest ministers of peace, by his sad fall; Gather increase of caution and of zeal; And, seeing on what slippery edge ye stand, Or foul and fatal lapse take the more heed;— With deeper thankfulness he'd bow the knee, While thus his fate productive prov'd of good To you, of truth blest heralds! whom he views With heart-felt anguish scandaliz'd, impugn'd By his atrocious follies: But for that Not honour'd less, or honourable, if rous'd, Ev'n by his errors, wisely you maintain Your high profession's dignity, and look With single eye intent on the great work Thrice holy, of your calling; happiest work Of mortals here, “Salvation of mens souls.” Oh envied pastor, who thus occupied Looks down on low preferment's distant views Contemptible; nor e'er his plotting mind To little, mean servilities enslaves; Forgetting duty's exercise sublime, And his attachments heavenly! Who nor joins In frivolous converse on the rise of this, Nor prospects flattering of that worldly clerk; Strange inconsistency! marching aloft With step superior and ambition's paw To dignity's wish'd summit!—Nor allows Envious, or spreads malicious the low tales Diminishing of brethren, who by zeal, Or eminence of merit in the cause, The common cause of Christ, distinguish'd shine: Of futile politics and party rage Who, heedless, ever for the powers that be In meek sincerity implores; and lives Only to spread around the good, the peace, The truth, the happiness, his open heart Innocuous possesses, as the gift Of him, the God of peace he serves and loves! Much envied pastor! Ah, ye men of God, Who crowd the levee, theatre, or court; Foremost in each amusement's idle walk; Of vice and vanity the sportive scorn, The vaunted pillars;—ah, that ye were all Such happy, envied pastors! how mankind With eyes of reverence would devoutly look, How would yourselves with eyes of pleasure look On characters so uniform! while now, What view is found less pleasing to the sight! Nor wonderful, my aged friends! For none Can inward look complacent where a void Presents its desolations drear and dark. Hence 'tis you turn (incapable to bear Reflection's just resentment) your lull'd minds To infantine amusements, and employ The hours,—short hours, indulgent Heaven affords For purposes most solemn,—in the toil Of busy trifling; of diversions poor, Which irritate as often as amuse: Passions most low and sordid! With due shame, With sorrow I regret—Oh pardon me This mighty wrong!—that frequent by your side Silent I've sat, and with a pitying eye Your follies mark'd, and unadmonish'd left, Tho' tenderly lamenting! Yet, at last, —If haply not too late my friendly call Strike on dead ears, oh profit by that call! And, to the grave approaching, its alarms Weigh with me all-considerate! Brief time Advances quick in tread; few hours and dark Remain: those hours in frivolous employ Waste not impertinent; they ne'er return! Nor deem it dulness to stand still and pause When dread eternity hath claims so high. Oh be those claims fulfill'd! Nor, my young friends, Whom life's gay sunshine warms with laughing joy, Pass you those claims unheeding!—In the bud Of earliest rose oft have I sorrowing seen The canker-worm lurk blighting; oft, ere noon, The tulip have beheld drop its proud head In eminent beauty open'd to the morn! In youth, in beauty, in life's outward charms Boast not self-flattering; virtue has a grace, Religion has a power, which will preserve Immortal your true excellence! Oh give Early and happy your young hearts to God, And God will smile in countless blessings on you! Nor, captivate by fashion's idle glare, And the world's shews delusive, dance the maze, The same dull round, fatiguing and fatigu'd, Till, discontented, down in folly's seat, And disappointment's, worthless, toil'd, you sink, Despising and despis'd! Your gentle hearts To kind impressions yet susceptible, Will amiably hear a friend's advice; And if, perchance, amidst the giddy whirl Of circling folly, his unheeded tongue Hath whisper'd vanity, or not announc'd Truth's salutary dictates to your ears, Forgive the injury, my friends belov'd; And see me now, solicitous t'atone That and each fault, each error; with full eyes Intreating you, by all your hopes and fears, By all your dear anxieties; by all You hold in life most precious, to attend, To listen to his lore! to seek for bliss In God, in piety; in hearts devote To duty and to Heav'n! and seeking thus, The treasure is your own. Angels on earth, Thus pure and good, soon will ye mount, and live Eternal angels with your Father—God! Of admonition due, just self-contempt, And frank expostulation's honest charge, The needful debt thus paid; haste thou, my song, As hastes my life,—brief shadow,—to its close! Then farewell, oh my friends, most valued! bound By consanguinity's endearing tye, Or friendship's noble service, manly love, And generous obligations! See, in all —And spare the tear of pity—Heaven's high will Ordaining wise and good. I see, I own His dispensation, howsoever harsh, To my hard heart, to my rebellious soul Needful and salutary! His dread rod Paternal, lo, I kiss; and to the stroke Severe, submissive, thankfully resign! It weans me from the world; it proves how vain, How poor the life of erring man!—hath taught, Experimentally hath taught, to look With scorn, with triumph upon death;—to wish The moment come!—Oh were that moment come, When, launch'd from all that's sinful here below, Securely I shall sail along the tide Of glorious eternity! My friends, Belov'd and honour'd, oh that we were launch'd, And sailing happy there, where shortly all Must one day sail! Oh that in peaceful port We all were landed! all together safe In everlasting amity and love With God, our God; our pilot thro' the storms Of this life's sea!—But, why the frivolous wish? Set a few suns,—a few more days decline, And I shall meet you.—Oh the gladsome hour! Meet you in glory,—nor with flowing tears Afflicted drop my pen, and sigh Adieu? END OF THE FIFTH WEEK. PIECES FOUND AMONGST THE AUTHOR'S PAPERS IN PRISON, WITH HIS LAST PRAYER. I. THE ADMONITION. Afflicted prisoner, whosoe'er thou art, To this lone room unhappily confin'd; Be thy first business here to search thy heart, And probe the deep corruptions of thy mind! Struck with the foul transgressions thou hast wrought, With sin,—the source of all thy worldly woe; To shame, to sorrow, to conviction brought, Oh, fall before the throne of mercy low! With true Repentance pour thy soul in prayer, And fervent plead the Saviour's cleansing blood: Faith's ardent cry will pierce the Father's ear; And Christ's a plea which cannot be withstood! II. SCRIPTURE-PENITENTS. (A Fragment.) First in the list of penitents we place The sinful parent of our sinful race; Who by temptation foil'd, and man's first foe, “Brought death into the world, and all our woe!” Transgression's debt how deeply does he pay! Depriv'd of innocence; to death a prey; From Paradise expell'd; to toil assign'd,— Toil of the fainting frame and sick'ning mind! And doom'd to shed, for near a thousand years, O'er fall'n descendants penitential tears! Thus seiz'd the triple league Sin, Sorrow, and Death. on mortal man, And thus, Repentance, thy sad reign began. Yet, awful Power! how blest beneath thy sway, Who feel Contrition's dictates, and obey! Their vicious deviations who detest, And hold Faith's cross, all-humbled, to their breast! From God's lov'd presence then they need not fly As Cain. Gen. iv. 14, 16.; Nor ope in wrath the flood-gates of the sky: For since to man perfection was deny'd, By thee his deep demerits are supply'd: And, led by thee a suppliant to the throne, The God of mercy looks with pity down: Smiles on the mourner, and delights to prove How free is grace, and how triumphant love! Eternal proof! See, bath'd in floods of tears, Where David foremost in thy train appears: How deep his crime, the prophet pictures well; How deep his penitence, those sorrows tell! That, whether to deplore the crime, or bless, We stand suspended; since its evil less, Less bright his soul's ingenuous grief had shone, And less at once his comfort, and our own! Hear, like a torrent how his sorrows roll; Conviction's tempest tearing up his soul! Hear, sad and solemn, to the mournful strings, In trembling anguish, how he weeps and sings! “Mercy, oh mercy, Lord! with humble heart; “For thy known pity's sake, mercy I pray! “Boundless in tender mercies as Thou art, “Take, Lord! oh take my foul offence away! “Oh, from my loathsome guilt, wash, cleanse my soul; “Remove, dear Father, each defiling stain: “Guilty, oh, guilty, Lord! I own the whole; “I see, I feel it; all excuse is vain. “Against Thee, Lord! ev'n Thee, have I transgress'd; “Lo, self-convicted, I before Thee fall! “Just are thy words; their truth is thus confess'd; “Just are thy judgments! Sinners are we all. “Prone to offend, or ere to birth I came, “My mother, when conceiving, gave me guilt: “Shapen in sin was my corrupted frame, “When in the womb that wonderous frame was built. “But Thou, of purer eyes than guilt to view, “Thou wilt accept the soul's sincere desire; “Pardon the past, the humbled heart renew, “And wisdom by thy secret one inspire. “Then listen to my cry; and oh, my God, “Purge me with hyssop, and I pure shall grow; “Wash me, foul leper, in the mystic blood, “And whiter I shall be than whitest snow. “Against the voice of gladness let me hear “Thy voice of pardoning love, for it is sweet: “The soul dejected so shalt thou uprear,— “The worm which, crush'd, lies trembling at thy feet. “Hide from my sins,—the objects of thy hate,— “Oh, hide thy face, and blot them from thy view: “A clean heart, God of grace, in me create, “And a right spirit in my soul renew! “From thy lov'd presence let me not be driven; “Let me not lose thy blessed spirit's aid; “Again the joy of thy salvation giv'n, “Uphold, support, sustain my heart dismay'd. “Then, of thy pardoning mercy satisfy'd, “Thy pardoning mercy loud will I proclaim: “So shall transgressors, taught by me, confide “In thy compassions; turn, and bless thy name. “Ah! my soul shudders!—From the guilt of blood, “Oh, from blood-guiltiness deliver me! “Oh God, deliver—my salvation's God, “And praise unceasing will I pay to thee. “Permit my lips, now clos'd by guilt and shame, “Thy pardoning love, Jehovah, to express; “Then to the list'ning world I'll tell thy name, “Proclaim thy praise, and sing thy righeousness. “For crimes like mine no offerings can atone; “The gift of outward sacrifice is vain: “Could these avail, before thy righteous throne “Whole hecatombs I gladly would have slain. “The contrite spirit and the sighs sincere, “Which from the broken, bleeding heart arise, “To thee more pleasing sacrifices are: “Are gifts, my God, which thou wilt not depise. “Hear then, and save! and to my people, Lord, “Thy saving mercy graciously extend! “Oh let our Zion live in thy regard; “The walls of our Jerusalem defend! “So shall the righteous to thy temple go, “And joyful bring their offering and their praise: “So shall the blood of lambs in plenty flow, “And incense on thy altar copious blaze See Psalm 51, and Christian's Magazine, Vol. III. p. 134.. With joy, with grief, the penitent I see, Offending Heav'n, yet Heav'n-absolv'd for me! Oh while, like his, I feel my guilt and shame, Be my repentance and my grief the same! Then shall the truth which cheer'd his heart be mine; Thy God has pardon'd thee, and life is thine. But hark, my soul, what melancholy sound Re-echoes from the dungeon's dark profound! Hear, sympathetic hear: A King complains, Fall'n from his throne, a prisoner, and in chains! “God of the world, at length thy rule I own, “And prostrate fall before thy boundless throne: “Thy power resistless, trembling I confess: “In threat'nings awful, but in love no less! “O what a blessing has that love assign'd, “By penitence to heal the wounded mind! “By penitence to sinners, who like me, “More than th'unnumber'd sands that shore the sea, “My crimes acknowledge; which, of crimson dye, “In all their scarlet horrors meet my eye! “Oh eye, unworthy of the light of Heav'n: “Oh sins too mountainous to be forgiv'n: “Oh rebel to the law and love divine, “How justly God's severest vengeance thine! “But oh, I bend my heart's obedient knee, “In supplication, Lord, for grace from Thee! “Yes, I have sinn'd, and I confess the whole— “Forgive me then, nor cast away my soul! “Save me from evil,—from thine anger save, “And snatch me from the dark, untimely grave! “Friend of the contrite, Thou wilt pardon give: “A monument of mercy I shall live! “And worthless as I am, for ever prove, “That true repentence leads to saving love! “That true repentance tunes to praise the heart, “And in the choir of Heaven shall bear an ample part See Prayer of Manasseh, in the Apocrypha, next to the First book of Maccabees; and compare 2 Chron. xxxiii 21, &amp;c.!’ Thus, by affliction's deep correction taught, Manasseh to the Lord for mercy sought: By the kind chastening of a Father's rod, Brought to the knowledge of himself and God! Happy affliction, for such knowledge giv'n; And blest the dungeon which led thus to Heaven! III. REFLECTIONS. (UNFINISHED.) Here, secluse from worldly pleasure, In this doleful place confin'd, Come, and let's improve the leisure: Meditate, my thoughtful mind! Soul alike and body sharing, How have I the one forgot! While for t'other only caring, Lo! my miserable lot! Yet the one I so much cherish, Doom'd to death when giv'n to life, Soon, perhaps, must sink and perish, Dust to dust—must end the strife! From a tedious tour returning, Into distant foreign land, How my anxious heart is burning News of home to understand! To My FRIENDS, Especially of the CHARITABLE SOCIETIES, On their Solicitude. Ah, my lov'd friends! why all this care for one To life so lost, so totally undone; Whose meat and drink are only bitter tears, Nights pass'd in sorrow, mornings wak'd to cares; Whose deep offence sits heavy on his soul, And thoughts self-torturing in deep tumult roll! Could you, by all your labours so humane, From this dread prison his deliverance gain; Could you, by kind exertions of your love, To generous pardon royal mercy move, Where should he fly? where hide his wretched head, With shame so cover'd; so to honour dead? Spare then the task, and, as he longs to die, Set free the captive,—let his spirit fly, Enlarg'd and happy, to its native sky! Not doubting mercy from his grace to find, Who bled upon the cross for all mankind. But if it must not be;—if Heaven's high will Ordains him yet a duty to fulfil; Oh may each breath, while God that breath shall spare, Be yours in gratitude, be Heaven's in prayer! Deep as his sin, and low as his offence, High be his rise thro' humblest penitence! While, life or death,—mankind at least shall learn From his sad story, and your kind concern, That works of mercy, and a zeal to prove By sympathetic aid the heart of love, On earth itself a sure reward obtain; Nor e'er fall pity's kindly drops in vain! I live a proof! and dying, round my urn Affliction's family will crowd and mourn: “Here rests our friend,” if weeping o'er my grave They cry—'tis all the epitaph I crave.</field>
