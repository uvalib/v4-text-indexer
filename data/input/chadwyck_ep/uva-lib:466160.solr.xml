      <field name="fulltext">[These songs, vain strays of idle hours] These songs, vain strays of idle hours, Were born not under sun or showers, But where your feet had passed they grew, Or sour or sweet, or weeds or flowers. Your voice to them as May-winds blew, Your footsteps gave them rain and dew, Your face was light to them; their skies Beneath your lids were gold and blue. Take from my hand what in me lies To give; when Autumn winds arise, Small harm to these will tempests do, So they find favour in your eyes. A LANE IN FEBRUARY. I wandered up this way last year; Unchanged, unmoved, it may not be Unlike what then it seemed to me; The same dull ivied trees, and here The same black hedges that gird in Downs barren as the breasts of sin, The same still wearied atmosphere. And then as now I slowly passed Along the steep divided slope, With aching heart and without hope, Scarce caring in what shape the last Blow fell upon my beaten brow, With eyes foreseeing then as now The future blacker than the past. What has the year left with me? One Sad love destroyed through time and scorn; A summer of delight forlorn; Memories of sorrows that are gone With grey and desolated hours; And this dry handful of spoilt flowers That died as I laid hand thereon. EASTER SONG. Poor Muse, to thee what may these sunbeams say? Old ere thy time, decrepit in thy youth, Accept in peace the inevitable truth, Be joined again unto the unquickening clay. Thy voice is lost, poor songstress of a day! There was a time when every passing grief Held out to thee its presage of delight: Now dulled and wearied, through unending night Thy soul sinks downward, hopeless of relief. O passionless despair beyond belief! The flowers leap forth to mock thine aching soul: The dancing sun laughs at thy dreary pain: Drive toward thy tomb with an untightened rein, On limping steeds attain thy utmost goal! At the grave's mouth death takes thy heart for toll. A LITTLE WHILE. Nay! Is it much to thee that year by year The Spring returns, when her soft languid days Give presage of July's sun-dazzling blaze, Most sure to come, lest we should doubt and fear? Thus kissing now your long throat, white and clear, I asked: but you who watched the sun's last rays Burn there behind the fir-trees, would not praise The thing I love in words I longed to hear. Wait! When we hear the robin piping shrill Through the dank season, o'er the misty hill, Then shall we shudder at that sad song he sings! Wait! When death comes upon his bat-like wings, How we shall yearn to know of flowers that fill, Laid low among foul worms and creeping things! BARCAROLLE. Without a parting word Love, like a wild sea-bird, Flies outward mocking me Across the sea. O wanderer without home, Thy wing-tips skim the foam, Then swiftly rising try The cloudless sky. I watch thy flight afar, Now like a falling star That seeks a watery grave Below the wave; Now like a boat thy breast Lies on the waves at rest, Mounting on them to glide Down the other side. Alone of all things free, Thou car'st not where thou flee So that thy course may be Far, far from me! DEUX PIÈCES DE TRISTESSE. [I.] The cool stream flows, Concealed from sight, To tell the rose Of new delight New-born with day.... O voice of May! The woods, scarce stirred By any breeze, Hear the sweet bird Hid in their trees That flash and shine.... O song divine! The sunlight showers Gold-pointed rays On apple-flowers And lily-sprays Refreshed with rain.... In vain, in vain! II. I hear the waves Sweep toward deep caves Remote from air; The far mews fly; The wind's low sigh Dies in my hair. On either hand, Past straits of sand, I watch afraid The bent sky's dome And lines of foam That gleam and fade. The throbbing sea Brings not to me Delight thereof; Wind, flower and bird Give me one word.... She will not love. SANS AMOUR. I do not doubt that I Am worthy of all your scorn; But yet, I know not why, I find it hard to be borne. You will not love me, my dear; The world would be well enough, Spite of our sorrows and fear, Was there a little love. THE CAGED THRUSH. The deep woods call me to their solitudes, The green deep rustling murmuring wavering woods, To their wild paths of fern and springing moss, Where winds a streamlet wanderingly across, And answers chafing elm-trees as it goes: Where she, who should have been my mistress, knows Not of my prison, and caring nought thereof Sings near her nest watched by another love; And my breast, when I see my brothers flee To fly or sing, strains outwards piteously, And my voice, rising as my sorrows strain, Recalls them who forsake me in my pain, Recalls them to my side; but never bird Comes nigh to me, and never chirping word Tells me how now the streamlet gleams and flows, Or tree-tops murmur when the west wind blows Through wild-wood alleys lined with moss and fern: But my heart still alone must ache and burn For all the murmurs of the wavering woods, And my love wandering in their solitudes. SPRING. Between the trees and trickling waterfall; Between the trees where throstles sit and call, Responding to the streamlet's undertone, As, rainbow-hued, from stone to mossy stone It slides, with tinkling drops of silver sound; Between the skies and still unfooted ground Where poppies and the flashing marigold Blaze gold and red, and drooping ferns enfold Cool caverns that the sea-nymphs know when they Rise from the breakers of the circling bay; Spring, shyly laughing in delighted shame, Before the noonday sun's exultant flame Fain to devour her flesh with kisses, hides The yielding beauty of her naked sides And white breasts starred with rosebuds, shines and cowers, Beneath massed boughs of scented apple-flowers. Also, from one spread branch, with drooping head, Clenched hands and swollen face, one hangs there dead. Foul type of man! Could'st thou not wait thy time? Or did remorse for some dread secret crime Rend up thy heart? Or anguish of desire For an escaping dream? The burning fire Of love, that turns our dayshine into night, For woman made not for thy soul's delight? What matters it? For thee all things are done: Spring trembles here with love; the amorous sun Has grasped her hair, and kissing blinds her eyes; And from his glad embrace she will not rise Until red evening float above the sea. Thou dost not know, fly-gatherer! And for me, One wish is mine, as thus I pass thee by; Would that I were as thou and thou as I! (After Fan Van Beers.) A PARTING IN MAY. Since Love is only born That he may die, And with the ripening corn The swallows fly, Since April for an hour Lives with the rose, Since every leaf and flower Fades ere the snows, Since nothing stays, nor Spring Nor Summer red, Since Joy dips on the wing And then is fled, Thou too, my love, take flight If so thou will, Like the faint sunset's light Above the hill That bears into the dark Our dim regret, Lest with dawn's earliest lark We should forget. Swift! Pause not now! Beware If I should yield; The sea-line is more fair Than any field. And where thou goest I may Not follow thee, Where the gold rose of day Dawns on the sea, Where sweeter scents are shed, Where love is lore, Where the frail poppies red Flame to the shore. For you the southern wave, The shores of Greece; For me—in one low grave My tears may cease! Since Love is only born That he may die, O love, my love, at morn Take wing and fly! BIRD OR WOMAN? If on his death-bed Love For all his pains may earn Reward, O sister of The swallows that return, Bid them, when with next May They chase the escaping gloom, Each morning dip and play Above his flowerless tomb. THEN AND NOW. We rowed on the sea one morning, You only, my dear and I; Was it meant as a blessing or warning, That seamew's bitter cry? Between us no word was spoken, We were so happy then; And now that my heart is broken, It will not be mended again. UTTERLY DEAD. When vanished dream and impotent desire Sink to the grave and gladly die with me, Your name burnt deep upon my heart will be The name my parched and fading lips respire. But though one name may pass my lips, the choir Of loves and hopes that now afar I see Some like the dead and some like foes that flee, No man shall know though once they sprang like fire. Not even the worms: though their blind mouths devour The flesh once fair in sunlight as a flower, They will not know the vanquished thoughts that die; But when I feel them on my mouldering head Then may I laugh, knowing of my dreams, how dead They are, how dead and rotten even as I. REGRET. Oh fair the green waves in the bay Roll whitening on the shore! For me, for me I can but say, Nevermore. I loved thee once in days long past, Atthis; my chance I missed; Alone I stand and murmur fast Had I wist. I loved thee once; beside the sea Love told not what he bore; Now wind and echo call to me Nevermore! AFTER DEATH. Though desert sands or ruined stones Lie heavy upon my buried head, Though worms within my skull are fed Or jackals on my putrid bones, Though the sea ever-chafing moans Above my limbs long-washed and dead, Doubt not my spirit will be led By thy sweet voice's tender tones. Fear not, if, when you vainly weep At midnight for reluctant sleep, You feel an unseen presence bow Toward you, and through the shuddering air Press down cold hands amid your hair And chilly kisses on your brow. THE RACE. In youth's first spring-tide when the awakening rose Unfolds her bosom to the mounting sun, We dream that we have but our course to run Well-hewn and straight, to rise beyond the snows. Alas! how soon the cliffs and rocks disclose, Impassable, their trackless summits dun, Howe'er we strive, at length appalled, undone, We fall amid the desert of our woes. We sang to beauty; and knowing nought thereof We sang the embraces of imagined love, Poor fools, whose lips have found no lips to kiss! Hope, like a plover, led us far astray: Night falls: we wander on an unknown way, Where panthers glide and secret serpents hiss. BALLATA. In Exile to his Lady. Since thou alone art free, Ballad, I bid thee go Where I no more shall come, Thou knowest, where oversea The mountain pine-trees blow, And my heart hath its home. Yea, past the washing of the windy sea, Far inland, where upon a mountain's crest Her castle shines, take thou my words for me; Say how my soul with misery is oppressed For loss of land, and love long time confessed To her who holds my heart Within her white sweet hands, And heeds not if it dies Or lives, who saw me part To these waste northern lands With unreluctant eyes. Song, born of hopeless love and violent pain Tell her of what despair thou art the child, That she may take thee in her arms and strain Thee to her full, fair bosom undefiled; And how beyond the shores and wet winds wild Thy master sees but strange Wide hills, not where of old The rose petals were red And bade the summer change The white leaf with the gold, And flowers of lovelier head. Or if her scorn flame on thee, then lie down Before her feet, and, kissing them, fall dead; And in the sea I too will seek to drown My grief, so haply when all life is fled The tides may drive my beaten limbs and head To my sweet fatherland, And the sea-birds may call Above me where I lie, Along the shining sand, Washed up, and over all The sweet blue southern sky. And she, perchance, upon some festive day May ride by me with laughter, and awhile Look down on me, still laughing, and will say: “What thing is this, wave-battered, torn and vile?” Then pass, gold-glittering, onward with a smile. Till the returning tide Bear me again from earth To grind my fleshless bones Among the caverns wide Where the sea-maids make mirth, And in dim weeds and stones. THE ROAD TO DEATH. “O well for you when I am dead, With loosened hanging hair to pass Unto the bubbling clear well-head, And sinking softly to the grass Lay hands behind your neck and sigh A little sobbing breath Alas, How sweet it is to live, and lie, Face upwards, on your back, to see The hollowed turquoise of the sky, And from the bent-grass hills, that be Blown up by breezes from the sand, Hear coloured secrets of the sea, Of lovers parting on the strand That now are bones, and bodies strange Washed up at full tide to the land: And watch the swallows sweet that range, And sing perchance some little song Dropt down the ages without change, Such as I sang you, doing wrong Unto the turn of broken rhyme, What time alone we rode along On hawking;” then a stone this time Smote on his mouth, and from the crowd Yells joined with laughter to the chime Of heavy muffled bells, and loud Beating of sullen drums: they led Him bare-foot on the dusty road, A rope about his neck that bled With chafing; then upon an hill, Where on his weary bended head A sword fell, while where yet the still Day blazed upon his distant land, His lady by the singing rill Held her new lover by his hand. JULY. O Queen of Months, awake and sing! O dawn-clouds red with day! O woods and mountains wake and ring! O hillside fountains play! O poppies laugh amid the corn! O blue-bells shake with glee! Ye saw my love this misty morn Sail up the silver sea. Her boat was swift; her sails were white; There is no bird but knows Her face is fairer than the light, Her bosom than the snows; Her hands are sweeter than the cells Where hides the honey-bee; Her mouth is made of joy that dwells Upon the silver sea. O skies, and breeze soft that bear Her prow through wreaths of foam, Shine, blow, shout, sing, to welcome her! My lady cometh home! My lady comes to land once more; My lady comes to me; Her ship is sailing on the shore Along the silver sea! A SUMMER'S LOVE. Between blue June and red July Love gat him golden wings to fly; With ringing feet and singing mouth He fled toward the scented south; He fled and fell in ambush there Amid my lady's coiling hair. Between July and August-time Love filled his mouth with honeyed rhyme; Cool wine between his lips was sweet While rose and lily drooped with heat; On him there blew no wine to rouse Beneath green shade of apple-boughs. Between the garden walks aflame With flowers, ere yet September came, Love lay, and wearying hour by hour Kissed once her beauty's sanguine flower, Then dreamed of all desires gone by With fiery footsteps of July. SONG AT SUNSET. Come! our vessel sways: Our untroubled home Calls us over ways Of untravelled foam, Calls us over ways That no feet have clomb, Over straits and bays Of untravelled foam. There the stars above Watch, a silent throng, Perfect nights of love Marvellously long: There the nights of love Pass as in a song Never wearied of, Marvellously long. There may we forget Lands wherein respire Longing and regret, Sorrows and desire. Longing and regret Fade, as from a lyre Notes that touch and fret Sorrows and desire. There our grief will be As a sea-bird's wing In the mystery Of the sunsetting, As a mystery That awakes to sing On a dreamy sea In the sunsetting. AFTER PARTING. I throw my wreath before her door, Cast ashes on my hair; What has been will be never more Albeit we found it fair: Though now no more where poppies gleam Shall we deem life divine, Our love will glide, a ghostly dream, Through vales of Proserpine. REMEMBRANCE. We know that when Apollo dwelt on earth Men made him herdsman of their sheep and swine; A later god, more human, less divine Found that with them a cross was deemed his worth; And did the Muses leave their heavenly birth To chant in lane and highway, they would win Brief answer, that they best had learn to spin, Nor make themselves sad whetstones for men's mirth. These rhymes of mine, wrung forth by weariness Of weary life among these fools, may bring Me in my lifetime nothing: let it be. But God! I pray Thee in after time to bless Me with some poet-lover who may sing My name, my lady's and our memory. MUSCADINE. I. Rose of Provence, not well Thou hast come where no man knows Thy brethren's fragrant smell, Rose. None here may say how those Flame-colours burn, or tell How their deep hearts unclose. Alone I feel thy spell, Knowing how the flower-land glows Where thy companions fell, Rose! II. Flower of the south, we twain Halve secrets of one hour Of April's sun and rain, Flower. Dead May-day's shine and shower And soft hands kissed in vain That plucked thee from thy bower! Of dead delight and pain Only my grief for dower And thy dried leaves remain, Flower. HER TRYST. Three hours I watched the sliding moon, And the white rivulet at my feet Dance to its old light silver tune, And smelt the languid puffs of sweet Dim-scented roses, dense with heat. I leaned across an apple-bough, And heard the cicales chirp afar: The dream of pleasure did endow That summer night with many a star That shine not where the planets are. Hard by, I heard the drowsy sea Roll murmurs to the sleeping land; God knows what thoughts were born in me. It was a touch of her light hand That made my heart to understand. So as night fell I wandered out Into her tangled orchard close; The time was thirsty with long drought: I walked between the swooning rows Of crimson and the yellow rose. Cold little shivers went and came Along my body, as each dream Of her pale face stung like a flame, Her face I saw within the gleam Of moonlit ripples in the stream. Thus waited I: three hours at least; And might have slept, so sweet it was, Only my heart burned for the feast Of hearing her soft footsteps pass Brushing amid the burnt-up grass. Then I grew sad; perchance, I said, She has forgotten, lies asleep Her loose hair pillowing her head; Mine eyes were full with tears to weep, Then, lo! I heard her long skirts sweep Along the pathway; seeking me She moved her neck and little face, An apple on a stately tree: I did not stir from out my place Nigh fainting so to see her grace. One hand caught up her skirt: she stood Swaying her tender body tall, As sways a cypress in the wood, Sideways, to listen to my call. I heard her bosom rise and fall. I think again I see her there, Uncertain if her quest was vain— The moonlight touching her red hair; And musing on our long past pain, My blood beats hard in every vein. I will not tell you how I spake The little sob of her delight, Our kisses. Still I ache and ache, Remembering all in time's despite. We had but little sleep that night. She is long dead; that night alone Was ours; I strayed from fight to fight; She drooped upon her noble's throne. Remember, when my soul takes flight, Once in my time I had some light. THE SINGER'S TOMB. If, on a summer day ye pass beside The shore look up, where from the cliff descend Two streams which run a little side by side, Then part and later in the sea have end; There lies the singer, where the streams diverge; He sings not now, nor hears the murmuring surge. One love had he who gave no love to him; He sang, and no man listened to his song; He sends this message from his silence dim, “I left life sadly though it did me wrong, Dying unloved, too young:” and for his name, Ye will not find it in the books of fame. THE END OF AUTUMN. O my dead youth, O summers passed in vain! For me through no September's evening mist Will roll no corn or vintage-bearing wain Deep-laden from my dried and sterile plain; The parting swallows mock with “Had I wist” The floating hopes that I have never kissed. Alas! I sob, “alas, what might have been,” And hate myself, sole author of my woe, For all dead pleasures played out long ago, To leave a gesturing shadow on the scene, With moaning mouth, and feet that pace between Gilt crowns, and masks and sceptres lying low. Ah, had I wist when dawn came up with spring! Ah, had I wist among the summer's flowers! Now Autumn fading with the crimson hours, Above my living tomb bids sorrow ring The muffled bell that shakes the ruined towers And yellow woods where I was wont to sing. AN EVENING LAMENT. When, on the purple waters lulled to rest, The sinking sun, like one who slowly dies And looks across the crimson-blossoming west, And vainly strives to hold the hour that flies, Remembering sunsets that have seen his head Ringed with love's aureole, and have passed away, Whose sweetness, save in memory, long has fled, And that may live but while his soul shall stay, Gleams sadly, and with the rising clouds a peace Falls on the moorland open to the sky, When all things, even the murmuring waters, cease To speak more loudly than a stifled sigh, When Hesperus, loved of all men from of old, Mirror of love's delight and of despair, Shines in the front of heaven's most glowing gold, Amid the heights of orange-tinted air, O Misery, grant thy slave one hour's release! Too long, too long have I with wounded feet Sought after thee the place of love's decease, The place where love and death at last may meet. Flower after flower sinks down, decays and dies; Leaf after leaf fades, falls and is no more; Sunset and night, and noonday and sunrise Pass, though new dawns and twilights wait in store: I, I who yearn to feel the frozen breath Of death benumb my mouth and eyes and cheek, Among the race of man that perisheth Alone find not what all may find who seek. O Misery! serpents are the chains that bind My feet; my feet are bound with thine own hair; Thy hands are armed with scorpions, and thy mind Is as a sea of madness and despair! TWO VOICES. What sounds there in the gusty night, (Only the wind and fall of the rain) That seems the voice of my heart's delight? (Leaves that tap on the window pane.) What drifts there between earth and sky (Only the wind and fall of the rain), That flies more swift than the clouds can fly? (Trees that shudder and groan and strain.) What cry calls from the whirl and din (Only the wind and fall of the rain), And wails as though it would fain come in? (Waves that thunder below the plain.) Whose white bosom or arm or face (Only the wind and fall of the rain), Gleams out there in the mad sea's race? (Foam that smokes from the seething main.) Whose long hair blows back from a head (Only the wind and fall of the rain) That once I kissed, and is now long dead? (Hair of the gale that no bonds restrain.) What low moan, as it floats away (Only the wind and fall of the rain), Seems to sob, thou shalt rue the day? (Thy love and thou are one, not twain.) Yea, for I know I shall rue the day (Only the wind and fall of the rain) When I turned the ghost of my love away. (Thy tears and love are alike in vain.) HYMN TO NIGHT. Along what pathway sown with stars for seed May we seek thee, O queen inviolate? Nay, on no way: for at our hour of need Thou comest covering us from love and hate. Dark huntress on dim ways beneath the moon, Thy feet fall on the silver-glittering waves, Thy hands bear sleep for thine unvalued boon, Thy voice is heard among the silent graves. O Night, thou sheddest calm oblivion On all that yearn for peace; thou succourest The halt and maimed, the blind, and every one Whom life has burned with anguish and unrest. The strong, the fair, these have their hour to live, These laugh their time and die; but we, but we To whom no sun had ever gifts to give Lift up our hands to heaven and call to thee. I seek not fame or wealth or even love: Alone I stand beside the waves in flight, And call thee lingering in the skies above, O sombre, blest and everliving Night! ON THE SHORE. Above her head, along the shaking pier Feet came and went, and in her maddened fear Seemed trampling down the life she fain would lift. Dark lowering clouds, wherethrough by many a rift Stars gleamed and vanished, like vast birds in flight, Blocked out the skies and smote her with affright. Beside the ravenous waves she paced, and heard The laughter of the living, jesting word, Snatched by the wind, and from the wall-girt hill Valse-music, loud one moment, then struck still. “But not for me,” she moaned, “Now all is done; There is no more for me beneath the sun; No more; no more!” The plunging waves beat in Crashing, and then the wind's tumultuous din Filled up their pauses, with the dragging sound Of stones sucked backward from the sliding ground, And noise of gathering rollers. “Magdalen! Yea, such am I who thought not such things then; There is no Christ for me, no, not for me! She found her Christ; but this life-swallowing sea Must be my Saviour, and my god is death. She was made clean, but I, but I!” Her breath Caught, and her mouth was silent; “Magdalen!” In scorn her voice took up the word again, And louder came the valse-tune, mocking her. “Ah, yes, up there they dance and laugh, up there They dance and sing, and I die here alone.” The spray dashed in her face, and with a moan, “God, God, deliver me,” she sobbed, “O God, That I must die!” With swifter steps she trod The pebbles, then stood still, and lifting high Her arms, she cried, “O God, that I must die;” Then, with her hands before her face, she went Into the foam, and fell. A wave half spent Recoiled and drew her outward. Through the night, The venomous waters, breaking on each height, Washed her white beaten body to and fro, Unresting in their tireless ebb and flow. A VIGIL. Beyond the night I gaze, and send afar Mine eyes to search if there be any light, Yet though they strain they see no glimmering star Beyond the night. I listen if some lighter strain may smite Mine ears than bitter fates that ruin and mar Men's lives with sound of waves or winds in flight. A moan from seas beyond the harbour bar I hear, a moan of seas that charge and fight, A moan that blows from lands where lost souls are Beyond the night. CONFESSION. I am as a December day that dawns Chill, dark and cheerless on deserted lawns, Where no bird lives, save one old crow whose curse Sounds like dim echoes of a dead remorse, Where rotting leaves, dead roots and reeking mist Call to the long past summer, Had I wist. I am as an old hulk that barely rides Upon the waves which beat its battered sides; But, conquered by its fates' unaltered spell, Groans, creaks and plunges to their fall and swell And while each roller bears it deeper down, Dreams of old days, of many a sunlit town, Rich shores, and seas that it has never crossed, Self-hating for the joys that it has lost, Abandoned, mastless, drifting to and fro Upon the dull unending ebb and flow. PRAYER. When on my lowered coffin lid The dried mould, hollow-sounding, falls, And passing forth you leave me hid Between the deep steep earthy walls, Let never thought of griefs we had, Sweet phantom, rise to trouble thee With sense of sadness: nay, be glad To know how well it is with me! L'ENVOYE. Well I remember, dear one, those dead days We watched from dawn to silent sundown strays— We plucked from passing plumes of envious time, Too sweet to stay, too sweet to mould in rhyme; The sea that far below our villa lay, The cliffs that shone along the rounded bay, The boats that stirred gold ripples in the dawn, Our walks at evening on the little lawn, Your face, your hand blue-veined and thin and white, The fisher's song that rose before the night To praise the sunlight from the darkening coast. When in some months, or some few years at most, We both lie dead, then, as we may not now, Will our two souls tell to each other how They loved this time that I sing of to-day: Meanwhile, dear heart, remember while you may!
