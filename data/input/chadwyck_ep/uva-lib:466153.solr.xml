      <field name="fulltext">TO MY WIFE. I picked these blossoms by the way, Which yet have something of the morn— A blush, a perfume, that may stay: I give the flower, I keep the thorn. Dedication. COOING TIME. We two are getting gray and old And in the yellow leaf, And soon will come the evening time, When falling shadows wax more cold, And harvest bells to service chime, To carry home the sheaf; But both have drunk of pleasure's fount, And had our happy loves, Nor do we grudge to give account Of duty, as is done by all; For though we droop, we can recall The cooing time of doves. Dear wife, thou never canst look old, Nor feeble is thy tread To one who reads the changeless truth, And knew thy morning's radiant mould; For I do see eternal youth, Behind the sweet grey head. And I remember when a boy I touched thy tiny gloves, And found a new and undreamed joy In kissing them, and still I hear Across the gulf of many a year, The cooing time of doves. Sweetheart, our feelings are not old, Nor find the growing gloom; The sunrise yet is on thy hair, Thy brow is innocently bold, I mark the bud which promised fair In thy calm autumn bloom. And though we reaped our bitter share, The angry shouts and shoves Which wedded us again in care, We had each other's conscious ken, And treasured on unharmed by men, The cooing time of doves. But if thy roses must get old, And gather of the shade Which may not hurt our better part, It's but the severing from the gold Of earthly dross, and hand and heart Together do we fade. Alight we hold the ancient flame Which warmed our early loves, Our mingled hopes are just the same, And life in waking or in sleep Abideth one, and now we keep The cooing time of doves. Prologue. APOLOGIA PRO ARTE MEÂ. Others ask me why I sing In the shine and shadowing Night and day, On my way, With my hand upon the string; I will say, I will say— Just because it is my way; Not that everywhere I mark, As I may, In the dawning and the dark Of green earth and scarlet sky, Mystery, Mystery, And a strange immortal spark, In the clod as in the planet, Glowing since its God began it; Not that ever more I see All around, All enwound, Blade of grass and honey bee, Butterfly and blasted tree, As I strike On my lute strings, all alike, With the margin of a bliss Sweeter than the Father's kiss, And a terror's black abyss, Madly blent In a white Fire of holy wonderment— Infinite, Infinite. This I do behold in all, In the bridal and the pall, Smile and tear, Life and death, Shriek of tempest, baby's breath— Noting beauty, joy and fear, In the wooing Of the love, And the cooing Of the dove, In the birds, That their little duties ply, Winged words, If they only call and cry; As in Nature, At full stature, With her grand hypocrisy. Some do flout my silver song, Deem it tedious, deem it long, Deem it over smooth and weak, With its purling Course and curling Circuits through all lands and times, With the messages I speak In my own too rapid rhymes. But I dare not, cannot stay Though in play Once, to linger With a rose Or a poppy, When a finger Mars its redness or repose, And I tamely will not copy What my heart does not disclose. I must go my easy way, And my own true teaching say, Though a thousand thunder nay Or contemn And condemn All my many tinkling notes And see nothing still but motes In my every rhyme or ray— Just because it is my way, Is my way, Is my way. For indeed I know no other Better plan, And I never had a brother, Born of man. And my heart yet will not smother Music learnt of winds and brooks, (Not of books) And must warble what it can. Others yield to custom's tie, Rest in any silken lie— I must sing, or I shall die. Is it instinct or obtuseness, Art or shoddy, Fraud or truth, But I do believe in body, And the rich and ripe profuseness Of a warm, full blooded youth, Plump and real, Not a marble cold ideal. And exuberance in woman Never yet has found a foeman, Never will, Never shall, At the fast or festival, In the fight or funeral, While old love retains the skill Chief in woman, And the beating heart is human. Ah, abundance is no fault; Its totality (Not a swinish animality Where we are agreed to halt) Is its favour And its beauty, And without it were as salt Which has lost its saving savour And its duty. The diffuseness of my song Does no wrong, Has no harm, Is its glory and its charm, Is its beauty and its strength, And the ease that comes at length (Only late, Fair as fate)— Is the final grace of art, And perfection of each part With the flowering of the heart; Though this power, In the hand Not accustomed to command Or to prune, May be still a deadly dower And make discord in the tune. If my singing errs as such, Is too much, 'Tis because I love the latitude Of the boundless air and sea And the rolling prairie lea, Not one attitude Stiff and starved, As if carved Out of stone, Nor one tone; I want room wherein to range Up and down Field and town, Chance and change, Ocean billows Where the petrels hang and play, Purple pillows In the old night's starry day. As the moorland breezes blow, Breezes blow Over miles of fragrant heather, Where the blue bells nod together; As the rippling waters flow, Waters flow, Through the pastures' daisied sweep To the deep, To the deep; As the birdies wave their wing And make woods with music ring, Music ring, In an ecstasy of trust, All and each because they must; So I sing, So I sing, In the poetry of trust, For I must, For I must. Passion like a leaping fire, Tears that start From my heart, Heaven's delight and earth's desire, Bid my art Play a part, Seize its lute and strike the strings, Till the sleeping thoughts and things Which of miracle partake Born in melody awake— Lisping leaves, Rustling sheaves, Brooks that babble, Girls that dabble Feet of snow in kissing waves Falling at those feet like slaves. Blushing roses' Red reposes, Lilies' anguish As they languish, Bleeding under Bees that plunder Them of gold They withhold, And the yellow nectar dust, Unto which they climb and cling, These I worship, these I sing, For I must. For I must. O, the method is the man— Is the man, And I cannot change my plan Foul or fair, For it is the very air Which I breathe, And wherein my fancies wreathe Or array themselves in light, And in shade; Nor in borrowed robe or right, Would I ever, if I might With false trappings masquerade. Yes, my manner Is my banner, It means more, It is I. Whether darkly soaring high, Or with vague and venturous prow On a far untravelled shore, Touching, just to pay some vow As no pilgrim paid before; Dropping now Into coy forbidden nooks, Where no prying sunbeam looks. Well I know there may be others, Sisters, brothers, Who uplift a loftier voice And possess a larger choice, And in liberty rejoice To be silent or to sing. I am one, Who have none; But, as blossoms in the spring At the waft of warmer air And new times, Rush to resurrection fair,— So my spirit chants and chimes And upon the sunbeam stair Romps in rhymes To and fro, As the living currents go, Ever bound to sing and fly From a sweet necessity. Others wander as they will, As they will, Like the straying of a stream Now in vigil, now in dream, With the pride of scornful skill, Through the vista of the valley, Here asleep, there with a sally Rioting, Murmuring Musically, In the most approved of measure, At their pleasure. But they feel no higher law Than their own, Not the awe Of the unseen and unknown In the study of a straw, And bestrown With the stardust, and the grace Like a world All upcurled In a tiny dewdrop's face; And for their capricious course They admit no deeper source Than some dim, Devious whim, Not a budding revelation's Obligations. But I hear the calling, calling And I feel the thralling, thralling Of the Powers Sweet as flowers, Soft as showers On green bowers, Drawing, guiding, Cheering, chiding, With a beautiful revulsion From this vulgar rack and wrong, By a dear supreme compulsion, Flooding me with silver song And a glamour and a glow, Till the flame Without name Must in music overflow. What the secret Voices fling From their lonely sacred summits, What the Silences may bring Deeper than the deepest plummets, Mirth and madness, Love and sadness, Tears of gladness, Mist on mountains, Fire of fountains, God Refiner, Man diviner, Breasts that no man Kissed on woman, Insect's wing, Lips of scarlet, Hair all starlit, Uncrowned king, These I sing, These I sing. Others step aside and play By the way Night and day; Others yield to lower lust, Baser strife, Wallowing in din and dust And red wrong Loved too long; But the point of passion's knife Never more allowed to rust, At my breast With unrest But anointed, Still is pointed. And I own the stormy gust, As I feel the yearning strong, Ripe and rife, With a doubt sublime as trust; While the singing is my life, And the living is my song, So I babble what I must, What I must, What I must. SECTION I. White Magic. WHITE MAGIC. Take, O take the magic bowl, Feed it with most lovely things, Tears and laughter that will shake the very rafter, Echoing on in the hereafter, Light of lilies and the soul Of our hidden spells and springs, And the death-bell's passing toll With the waft of angel wings; Mix them kindly, mix them madly, dumbly, blindly With the moonlit dews that rest, And the red so unconfin'dly Sleeping on the rose's breast. Take, O take a virgin heart From the baby as it dreams Of its mother and the kisses rained that smother Lips responding to no other; Mingle it with masons' art, Deft to catch the morning gleams, White on turrets as they start Upward like embodied beams; Throw in buttercups and daisies, and the shutter Dropt by shadows when they fall, Mirth and melodies that utter Pain within the woof of all. Take, O take the lambent fire, And the cunning flowers of frost Dimly painted on the windows as if sainted And for evermore untainted; Blend them with the marriage tire Of a maiden loved and lost, And ineffable desire For the pathway yet uncrost; Freely scatter snow, and honeyed words that flatter Fools and still have something true, Grace of children and their chatter, And a blessed rift of blue. Take, O take from clouded skies Thunder, and of purple air Bloom and winning charms from breezes all a-spinning Webs that break and keep beginning; Add to colour where it lies On the cheek and haunting hair Of a woman's sorceries, Innocent that she is fair; Join to clamour of the strife that secret glamour Softening low the steps of lust, And on waves that stir and stammer Cast a handful of gray dust. WHITE WINGS—A THEOPHANY. There was silence in the city, there was silence on the lea When that fateful voice went forth Through the night, into the north, And the leaves that made a music like the murmur of the sea, As in sounds of solemn worth Rode the White Wings on the stillness that responded to their plea; For that vision With decision Cut the vapours, as they hung Like a curtain In uncertain Light, and as a censer swung; And the oaring of those White Wings was a wonder to the eye, While they voyaged grandly on As of old in Babylon, With a message for the earth life, and a mission from the sky, That reached out into the future, and reached back across the past, Calling man of peace and slayer From their slothful dreams to prayer And the holy preparations of the vigil and the fast— “O ye sinners who transgress, Come to penance and confess, And your evil deeds redress, While the door of grace is open and the hours of mercy last.” And beneath the ancient belfry in the shadow of the tower, With the magic of the moon And its candle, that would soon Be extinguished by the sun-blaze as it burst again in flower, Death was waiting for its boon And a quiet resurrection when the White Wings gave it power; For the mortal From its portal Then once more in beauty broke, And the sleeping Graces keeping Their long trysting-time awoke; As they heard that cry of ages, in their centuried retreat And their fellowship with dust, Which aroused the quickening trust And the seed of everlastingness that could not own defeat; While it robbed the grave of victory, and took from fear the sting, Calling through the earthly layer, “O ye corpses, come to prayer, For your trance is but a trouble that will final glory bring To the darkness of the clods, And the winter rains like rods, Ye shall yet up spring as gods, And those crumbling frames be crowned with delight—arise and sing!” But the White Wings seemed to order me to follow as they flew, As they floated like a cloud Which was shaping in a shroud Some new miracle of life, that of the mist and starlight grew, Till the night wind waxing proud Of the marvel and the mystery its gentle trumpet blew; And a whisper Clear and crisper, As it gathered of all good From the numbers And the slumbers Of the water and the wood, Like the speaking of the Universal Spirit fell on me; And it kindled me like fire, With an infinite desire, And those White Wings seemed a symbol of the better things to be; While it trembled on my heart-strings like a finger on a lute, Calling doers and the sayer To the awful shrine of prayer, Where the shining walls are worship and the shouts of passion mute, “O ye peoples of the lands Come with praises in your hands That will wash away the brands, And array you in the righteousness of the Divine repute.” Thus I seemed to flit for ages over map-like sea and shore, And uncharted earth and sky, Where the White Wings rustled by With the burden of the warning that to every clime they bore, As from old eternity, While the dry bones stirred behind them and the heavens flamed out before; And I pondered As I wandered Through the chambers of the air, Would my travel Now unravel, The dark riddles of despair? But none answered, though I followed the one watchman of the night, As he uncompanioned sped On his task unpiloted In the dreadfulness of twilight and his ministering flight; And a ghostly presence bathed me in a rapture more than bliss, Calling drudge alike and player To the marriage feast of prayer, When before the sob of penitence comes absolution's kiss— “O ye sinners, who are lost Or by gusts of craving tost, The grim border can be crost, And the White Wings yet shall carry you safe o'er the black abyss.” And now ever when the evening falls and owls begin to sweep On their broad majestic vans, With another way than man's, I go sailing with the White Wings through the spaces dim and deep, And decipher the dark plans Of the margin of the mysteries that haunt the worlds of sleep; And no stigma Of enigma Now is bitter as of old, And rate petals Like rich metals In the silent hours unfold; I go sailing with those White Wings over mountain, moor and dale, Over forest, fields and brooks Which to me are open books, And they sigh to me their secrets of the far and future tale; But the Voice proclaims its teaching to the inward upturned eye, Calling pilgrim soul and stayer To themselves in solemn prayer, While the Vision gives them seeing of the sacred euphrasy, “O ye dead at length upstart, And ye thoughts that death impart From the white and new-washed heart Take its colour, till each skeleton is a theophany.” WHITE ROSE. There it lay in the terrible slough of the slums, There it lay in the gutter and mire, And it burned with the beauty of fire That repelled the rude grasp of the envious thumbs, And hard fingers that quarrelled with dogs for mere crumbs, But shrunk back from one dainty desire; There it lay In broad day, A white rose, That looked bigger and brighter, And fairer and whiter Because of its muddy repose. How it came in that squalid and pestilent gloom, With its message of mercy and light For the shadow more dreadful than night, No one knew as they gazed at the delicate bloom All askance when they passed to the sin and the doom, Though they felt and they hated their blight; No one knew Where it grew, Whence it dropt, As it seemed to wax sweeter And blossom completer, But no one to gather it stopt. There it lay in the thick of the horror and shame Like a challenge from heaven sent down, To the drab with her mud-spattered gown And the creature unsexed, and but woman in name; While to each it seemed different—awful as flame, A reproach, or the glimpse of a crown; There it lay On their way, A white rose, Just like silvery metal, No stain in a petal, As if it had more to disclose. Now and then some went slower and almost stood still, A rough child that if tended were fair With the halo not fled from his hair Which the angels had fondled, before his blind will In the darkness around him as comrade chose ill, Or a girl with yet innocent air; But none could, And none would Venture quite For a moment to linger Or touch with a finger, That purity dreadful and white. Till at last from the mob and the misery crept A lame girl with the glory of fears, And the jewels of penitent tears; While virginity that had so long in her slept, Now awoke as from dreams, and in melody leapt To the early desire of the years; Sweet and low In the glow Of delight, Down she knelt with her meanness And conscious uncleanness, That turned a sick bloom to the light. With a thrill of unworthiness flushing her face, Then she guiltily thrust in her breast The strange prize that in passion was prest, And the freshness with all its ineffable grace In a moment came back to her tender embrace, As a homing shy bird to its nest; There it grew, There it blew, As with those Who are true to their nature And rise to full stature, With roots in her heart—the White Rose. WHITE WORDS. There was worship in heaven and wonder on earth When the white queen of purity spoke, And the pauper forgot all the bondage of dearth, While the ashes leapt up and awoke, As they broke Into beauty and blossom of fire; The dead hearts renewed ancient desire, And wan maidens their snowy attire; For her voice had the glamour and gladness of truth And the thoughts were themselves all in rhyme With the dew and delight and enchantment of youth And the infinite story of time. Not the words of our wisdom the fair and the fit, Not the speech of the reverend sage With his splendour of learning and sparkle of wit, In the mellowing harvest of age; Not a page From the richest resultings of years; But a music that fell on the ears, With the babble of song birds and tears; And the voice of the spirit that pierces the soul As the arrow that goes to its mark, And brings back to the deaf their departed control With a murmur of morn in the dark. From her lips flew the message of virginal life, A new ministry breathed in old names On the hardness and squalor of bestial strife, And the vilest of shadows and shames; Winged flames, That set animal natures aglow With a freshness no art could bestow. As if heaven surged up from below; Crystal flakes which alit on the petrified rest With a soft'ning appeal, and were such That they kindled at once the dull stone of the breast Into glory and grace with their touch. Words of hope from the depths of an infinite joy, Like the whisper of Spring in the air, That just seemed as they dropt to consume the alloy And the evil of all things not fair— To repair What was broken with promise of dawn, And its colours of paradise drawn On gray brothel as on the green lawn; For she spoke as a queen who has passed beyond hell And yet carries the scorching and stain, And has tasted all sacraments trial can tell Being crowned with the crowning of pain. Warm white words from the fountain of love and the light Freely scattered as jewels on all, That were seeds of a manhood to come in its might, The auguster because of its fall And the pall; For she uttered herself, and the blind Yet in her did their heritage find, And partook of that beautiful mind; She came down to the sorrow and down to the sin, She was one with the feeble and faint, She revealed to the meanest the marvels within, And in rags the sweet aureoled saint. Ah, they listened to her, the poor, starving and stained As they drank in the music of hope, While the captives remembered no more they were chained, And the murderer saw not the rope, But the slope. That leads up to blue roses of skies, As he gazed with his red rheumy eyes, And beheld a new Eden arise; For the halt, and the maimed, and the crippled in heart Everyone found some quickening tone, A new life that sent shoots through the sickliest part Within each, as for each all alone. THE COMING OF THE WHITE SOUL. She was wrapt in a garment of snow, She was bathed in the beauty of fire, While her eyes had a heavenly glow, And her breath was a holy desire, When she came, Sweet as blossoms of flame, With a love that burned brighter than wine And a tenderness human, divine, Robing round In a passion profound All the horror and evil and shame— When she came. There was silence in Heaven, and earth For a season of worship stood still, And the poverty dreamed not of dearth, While the famishing once had their fill; When she came, With the wonderful Name That is whispered by angels in awe, The new service that springs not from law, And the light That is perfected might, To transform each unvirginal frame— When she came. There was movement in desolate graves, And a rustling of beautiful wings, While the drudges forgot they were slaves And in dignity rose up as kings; When she came, And the lepers and lame Started forth from the gloom of their dens, And remembered their bodies were men's, And their hearts Should play worthier parts, And had finished with fretting and blame— When she came. There was lisping of joy in the air, And a stirring of all the dry bones, As when birds are beginning to pair, And the leaves laugh in musical tones; When she came, As serene and the same As the march of a conquerer's tread, And the buds from the darkness and dead Leapt to life, And the dolorous strife Of the ages felt one who could tame— When she came. THE MAKING OF THE WHITE SOUL. Fired with the battle fever, tost upon iron waves Still by the grim deceiver death among open graves, Vainly I sought the purging needed by my sick breast, All in the bloody surging, all in the red unrest. Wounded but yet no cleaner, broken but yet the same, Dying but yet the meaner out of the wreck I came. Where should I bathe my sorrows, where should I wash me white, Ere the avenging morrow's reckoning infinite? Death only mocked me ever though I pursued its path, Cleansed not my wild endeavour with its refining wrath. Then within court and column sought I the blessèd balm, Craved with devotion solemn, wooed in the sacred psalm; Gazing my eyes grew moister, fixed on the fateful cross, Sealed in the silent cloister armed to assay my dross. Vainly I met the lashes, vainly I did endure Sackcloth and fast and ashes—still I remained impure. How should I lose my tainted nature and make me white, Clothed in apparel sainted, holiness infinite? Then by my awful study, eager I hoped to leave Sin and pollution muddy, holding me down a slave; Digging the dusty treasure torn from the jealous years, Reaping a sober pleasure purchased with time and tears; Turning the yellow pages hourly and day and night, Torturing sere old ages still for the questioned light. Vainly I asked each sentence all that from flesh might wean, Vainly I read repentance—still I abode unclean. When should I drop my chaining rags for a vesture white, Weaving instead of staining comeliness infinite? So in the woe and welter made by the miry street Merged I forsook the shelter cold as a winding sheet; Hailed in the lost my brothers gained from no musty shelf, Hoping at last in others thus to redeem myself. Bravely I put my shoulder now to a humble part, Gathering grace and bolder strength for my hungry heart, Till from the kindly toiling done in the common way, Slowly the sin and soiling faded and fell away; While, though by tardy stages, dawned like a sunrise sure, Blessings not bought by wages, giving a franchise pure; And to my empty bosom, till it possessed the whole, Breaking all into blossom, beautiful came the Soul. For, as the shadow dwindled, waxed the new nature white, Shedding a peace that kindled happiness infinite. THE WHITE THOUGHT. In Mente Dei. Hid in the mind of God beautiful there it lay, Pure as a world untrod, shy as an opening day; Virginal, the White Thought brooded on joys to be, Ravishment yet unwrought, mightiness of the sea; All in Divinity draped breathing of earth and sky, Infinite and unshaped dream of Eternity. Moved in the mind of God, wonderful as the beams Spilled on a moonlit sod, splashed upon mountain streams; Thought as refined as gold, big with most blessèd things, Seeking the meetest mould where to expand its wings; Yearning for outward form somewhere at last in Time, Stronger than winter storm, soft as a silver chime. Fed in the mind of God, craving a holy vent Whence it might make the clod glow as the firmament; Thought that would roll the earth drooping with shame and lack, Out of its dusky dearth into a broader track; Sweet as the heart of a child, dim as love's refuges, Splen did as undefil'd soul of the silences. THE WHITE SERVICE. Come, lay one hand upon the cross and lift one hand to Heaven, And swear whatever be the loss to purge out all the leaven Of evil from they treacherous heart, and do a soldier's worthy part Unsoiled by sinful revel; To guard the Church, which others trod in rapine, by the grace of God Against the world and Devil. Come, kneel and keep a trustful tryst from midnight to the morning Alone with the White Blessèd Christ in simple unadorning, Within the shadow of this fane beneath the storied blood-red pane That breathes a brighter morrow; If in this ghostly place at length thy Lord may clothe thee with His strength And cleanse thee in His sorrow. With all my priestly power I bid thee weep and wait thy season, And hold the watch our Captain did on that dark night of treason; To face the banded hosts of ill with armèd breast and iron will, And prayers shot up like arrows. The death-bell, it may be, will toll the sin away that sears thy soul, When darkness round thee narrows. Lay down thy head and keep the tryst which saints have kept for ever, These hours with the White Blessed Christ by true and strong endeavour, In penance and the bitter woe which is the demon's dying throe That parts not but by rending; And ere the dawn upon thee shakes its shafts and sunrise in thee wakes, May come the conqueror's ending. Perchance the Lord will tarry long, or break on thee in thunder, And crashing with the tempest song burst the black night asunder; Perchance in visits of the moon the love that lives will meet thee soon In bridal sweet and solemn, And somewhere in this reverend wall will rise the dear expected call From cloistered depth or column. But be thou brave and keep the tryst which all must keep who cherish The faith of the White Blessed Christ and for that faith would perish; Perchance with calm compelling voice that makes the saddest heart rejoice He will descend in meekness, Who feels for thy exceeding shame and has put on our mortal frame And knows each want and weakness. Come, lay one hand upon the cross and lift to Heaven the other, And swear the world to thee is dross and every man thy brother, And thou wilt never stain thy life with brutish lust or sordid strife But deem thy purpose holy, And treasure pure as linen fine thy garments by the grace Divine In service fair and lowly. Come, keep the one last dreadful tryst in lonely dedication Apart with the White Blessed Christ to win His consecration, And let no anguish for the past or fear of future care o'ercast Thy settled great decision; Then shalt thou wash within the flood of His most awful saving Blood And thou shalt see the Vision. WHITE HANDS. I had a longing for white hands, that waved In some dim land of moonlight That knew no garish noonlight, Where never wind of trouble roamed and raved; Where all was hushed and holy, The falling leaf fell slowly, And none for aught in that sweet plenty craved; Where hope sufficed to have, and will was power And rushed in ripe fruition, Without the long transition Of seed and blade and bud, to perfect flower; I had a longing for white hands, that called for me in evening lands. I sought the vision of white hands, that lay In beauty more than blessing And peace beyond caressing, On love as shadows on a dying day; That with no mortal motion In tune with my devotion Might for a honeyed season with me stay; I knew a magic virtue flowed from such, And in a passion tender My spirit to full splendour Would leap beneath that soft transforming touch; I sought a vision of white hands, where purple waves kissed golden sands. I found the healing of white hands, that fell As dew on grass at morning, Just in their own adorning, As gentle starlight on the city bell; And O the quiet rapture Of that exceeding capture, Which opened in my breast its hidden well! And not by vulgar ways with sordid hire Did I attain the wonder, And burst my bars asunder, I passed to it through angry flood and fire; I found the healing of white hands, that were to me as God's commands. I keep the glory of white hands, that lie Upon my brow and bosom, And make my being blossom And link to love with sacramental tie; They come with kindly graces From sweet and sudden places, And build for me the home that cannot die; Before the dawning or when lights are low, And owls begin to stutter, I feel, I hear them flutter Betwixt the earth and heaven in gloom and glow; I keep the glory of white hands, that bind my heart like wedding-bands. WHITE FEET. Lo, they came in the darkness, they came in the grief When my burden was heavy to bear, In the sorrow and night that was not a relief Nor a robe that the wretched might wear; They were little white feet and delicious and sweet In the fashion of snow flakes and air, As if silence and gloom had just burst into bloom And a form the most winsome and fair; As if out of the dew and the rapture and bliss Of the moment that never comes twice, Love had sent me a sign that makes nothing amiss And that cannot be bought with a price. I was troubled and torn, and despair shut me in To the shadow of shame and my woe That was deeper than thought and more dreadful than sin, As if I had myself turned my foe; Then those little white feet that were maiden and meet For the message I sought for in vain, From the horrible husk of the death and the dusk Came in pity and ease for my pain; And the curtain of blackness around me all broke Into roses of purple and light, And the joy at the heart of my sadness awoke Like a morning of June in its might. And I fancied they said to me “Follow the way Which we tread through the travailing years, For wherever we go there is always the day And a golden horizon appears!” Then those little white feet that were holy and fleet On the errands of kindness and care, Went before me in love as they raised me above The old anguish and evil I bare; O they were not of woman, they were not of child, But partook of the beauties of both, They were softer than music and never defil'd, And with mine kept the tenderest troth. If I doubt in the journey of life what is best, If I step for a season aside, Then they seem to be walking in tears on my breast And the depths of my being divide; Yes, those little white feet guide me straight in the street And in pleasure and mourning and toil, For they cannot lead wrong and they move as to song And they gather no blemish or soil; Ah, I know when I come to the border at length Of the River that flows for us all, They will brighten before me the gulf in their strength And their purity—lest I should fall. WHITE BOSOMS. It was done, I cannot say why and where I may not tell, Somewhere before blush of day, somehow ere the matin bell; Sweet white bosoms came to me 'twixt the gleaming and the gloom, Wonderful and soft to see, dear and terrible as doom In the sureness of the pureness Which alone doth make man free, giving to the spirit room; Curtained was each face from light, shrouded were the limbs and form, In a shadow rosy bright simply showed the rapture warm Swelling now to sudden flower, swooning then in secret bliss, With the poetry of power gathered to a crimson kiss. All my passion, all my heart surged to meet that gentle thing, Thrilling through my every part till my being seemed to sing; Sweet white bosoms kindly came thus into my lonely lot, With the clearness as of flame and a splendour without spot; Drawing nearer still and clearer In the shyness more than shame, yet with love that wavered not; Beckoning to something glad, something that desired to bless Far beyond the joys I had, in their dumb deliciousness; And I felt around me curl'd arms as delicate as air, Fragrance of a finer world where is nothing but the fair. Then the black breasts of the night which had made me sadly err Melted into misty flight, with a silence sinister; Sweet white bosoms took their place by a modest miracle, Breathing everywhere a grace uttered but ineffable; And my feelings' grand revealings Waxed as infinite as space, in their golden crucible: Virgin fancies, vestal thought veiled in holiest attire Of their nakedness and wrought from delight and from desire, Floated under me and round, till I seemed with throbbing charms By some ecstasy enwound in all lovely women's arms. THE WHITE LIFE. What is the long life? What is the strong life Showing the clue, Giving their hue Still to the stages run by the ages, written on pages Noble and true? Is it the iron arms that environ Natures more hard, Stubborn and starr'd Over with graces of the grim traces on the sad places Fighting has scarr'd? This is not all life, this is the small life, Bloody and barr'd. What is the sweet life? What the complete life, Beautiful, fond, Pointing beyond Our little trouble past as a bubble, gone as the stubble, Though we despond? Is it the rounded lot that is bounded Gently by lore Heaping up store, Commune with tender spirits of splendour fain to surrender Freely yet more? This is not brave life, this is a slave life, Not the real ore. What is the pure life? What the secure life Making men live, Eager to give Better than glory and the pale story haloed with gory Light fugitive? Is it the wizened fate of the prisoned Saint in his cell, Hugging the shell Shut on the embers left by his members' fire that remembers Weakness too well? This cannot be life, this is not free life— Bible and bell. What is the great life? What is the straight life Conquering ill, Able to fill Hearts in each corner, grief of the mourner, doubt of the scorner, One with God's will? It is the serving glad and unswerving Ever of man, Just as we can, Leaving the blotted world with its spotted husks that have rotted, Spent with their span; This is the White Life, this infinite life Perfect of plan. THE WHITE BOOK. Who shall open the Book?—First, the reveller came With lascivious look and the shadow of shame And inglorious dust on his brow; Though he reeked of the cup, yet he stoutly stood up Fresh from breaking the holiest vow; And the roses that clung to his forehead and hung On the blighted remains of a man, Had the vagrant and fragrant reproaching of wine While accusing abusing of treasures divine, And looked back to the lovelier plan; But the White Book remained yet as solemn and sealed, With its joys unexplained and its rest unrevealed. Who shall open the Book?—The philosopher came From his studious nook and unblotted by blame, And his front was a thunderous throne, While his glorious eyes shone as infinite skies From the work that was lofty and lone; The imperious fire of his daring desire, With the thoughts that had journeyed through space, And yet travelled unravelled retreats of the truth Gave a second unreckoned and mightier youth, And like sunrise lay broad on his face; But the White Book in awe and in secret composed, Still remained with its law and the light undisclosed. Who shall open the Book?—Then the moralist came With the shepherding crook and his virtuous fame, And the Pharisee frowned from his dress, In his forms so secure, with decorum demure And his dogmas no more and no less; But he set a cold hand like the winter's command On the reverend tome as it lay, With the sureness of pureness though merely on skin If it varnished and garnished the outside of sin, And he met a new terrible ray; For the White Book remained in its mystical lore, With the sense unattained and as dark as before. Who shall open the Book?—Then a Pariah came, And the passion that shook him was burning as flame— He was ragged and troubled and torn; But he thirsted for love, and his gaze looked above, Though his bosom was pierced by the thorn; And he knelt humbly down with the cross as his crown, But in faith that would fashion a globe; And his meanness grew cleanness before those great beams While his craving was saving as poetry's dreams, And his rags made the kingliest robe; But the White Book in power to his beautiful care Opened out like a flower, and its burden stood bare. THE WHITE GOD. Out of the nor'land, under the foreland it blew, Wind of a jubilant tone Touching the heart that was stone, Happily telling hope not for selling—and grew; Out of the south-land, warm from the drouth-land, arose Waft of a miracle fair, Chanted abroad in the air Rich with its capture, breathing the rapture—repose; Far from the east land, mystery's feast-land, the tale Murmured on musical strings Measures of pageants and kings, Speaking in wonder, waxing in thunder a gale; Last on the west-land, bloom of the best land, He trod Victor in triumph and tears Born of the yearning of years, Great beyond seeming the one redeeming White God. Pen cannot write it, fame not indite it—the truth, How He in majesty stept Stilling the sadness that wept, Shedding around Him light that enwound Him with youth; Wrapt in a splendour dread but as tender as sleep, Keeping all cares as His own Treasures though mean and unknown, Mild as maternity, yet as eternity deep; Birds to the Master, waited for, faster still flew As to the kisses of morn, Fearing no buffet of scorn— Outcasts of city bathed in the pity that drew; All that was weakness all that was meekness and shod Humbly and shamefully here Won a safe refuge and sphere More than a dwelling, in the compelling White God. Children with laughter met Him and after Him ran, Feeling a Brother and Child Also in Him when He smil'd, Finding their places in His embraces and plan; Grandeur before Him stooped to adore Him who led Taking its crown from Him back, Plenty without Him seemed lack— Dross from the metal, stain from the petal, both fled; Evil and sadness, mischief and madness, reproached Shrunk in the ruin they plied, Envy was famished and died, Dearth that had dimly fallen and grimly encroached; Shades of affliction, war's malediction and rod Melted or turned to a staff, Gold from the sickliest chaff Sprang at the healing of the revealing White God. SECTION II. Songs of Gramarye. A SONG OF GRAMARYE. This is a song of Gramarye— The summer moon At full and yellow, and mild and mellow, Was sailing through a thunder sky For setting soon; Its pilgrim light, More lovely on the edge of sinking With its round cup was sweetly drinking The glory of the purple air With deep delight, And waxing still more fresh and fair In measured flight; The riven mass of driven cloud Spread awful wings that fain would fly, And spoke in murmurs but not loud— This is a song of Gramarye. This is a song of Gramarye— A baby boy, All nude and weeping, alone was keeping His watch with old eternity, And asked a toy; Upon the sand He wandered up and down untiring With eager step, and still desiring One plaything which he could not get In dimpled hand, With hungry glances wild and wet For his demand; And straining for the waning lamp Whose distance mocked his troubled cry, His rosy feet would fret and stamp— This is a song of Gramarye. This is a song of Gramarye— The yellow moon With magic gesture threw off the vesture Of gold, and far infinity Its dreadful boon; With sudden gleam, The rapture of a white rose maiden Brake from the glamour overladen And bursting into silver flower Upon a beam Descended, pouring in bright power A starry stream; And lifting through the rifting gloom, The naked joy that flitted by, She gathered him to her own bloom— This is a song of Gramarye. This is a song of Gramarye— The heaven came down, To make a pillow for the billow And wrought it rich exceedingly For godhead's crown; On sea and shore, Behold, the earth not now sad-hearted Walked with the sky, and space departed With all the terrors of the deep, Estranged no more, And dazzling noon and night and sleep Held common store; The nations in creation's dew Put off their dull mortality, And ran their courses glad and new— This is a song of Gramarye. NAKED NATURE. I had a vision of an angel face; It came to me one magic April morning, When every flower through every sunwashed place Was breaking out in beauty and new grace And put on fresh adorning, With shy scorning; As if, with sudden flame and secret strife And throbbing heart of thirst, At last they burst Into the glory of a greater life. And this bright Angel face Stept out of Space, Which as some blue and palpitating blossom Opened itself and showed the swelling bosom And that white wonder of the naked form, As soft as sleep and most divinely warm, From the small golden head down to the feet That trod in passion proud Upon a cloud— A form delicious pure and virgin sweet. Naked, but clothed in light of coloured vesture, And with unfathomed eyes Like azure skies, She stood before me with compelling gesture, Bathed in a glow that never fell on man, Or fairest woman Of most perfect plan Who gathers to her all the glories human; Clothed in her own bright beauty Like a dress, Which seemed her duty— That great loveliness; All flushed with passion That was utter purity, She read the fashion Of the dim futurity, With eyes that travelled On and on through haunted Space and unravelled Riddles dark, undaunted; Ablush with love That played in lambent fire, With brow above And feet of earth's desire, She stayed my wandering with her waving hand Whose waving was command, And by the glamour of her conquering look, And lips like rosy rhymes Telling the stories of all climes and times, Their changes and their chimes, And poetries of every blessed book. But, lo, the beauty of each separate flower, Each individual grace Poured on her face The writing and the rapture of its power; And she partook of each Within the compass of her bright embrace, Whate'er might gladden her exceeding dower And living lessons teach. But then O was it sound of laughing waters, Or waft of summer winds From fragrant Inds Where star beams walk with moonlight's magic daughters? A fount of music broke From overflowing silence and the shrine That seemed a holy shrine; Spirit to spirit spoke, And I awoke To the full stature of a strength divine. Round me her radiant arms In dew and fire were folded, And I was moulded By the deep impress of her Angel charms To something fairer still Than any earthly shape by sculptor skill, And the celestial rose that was her mouth, Laden with all the perfume of the south And other ages gone When larger sunlight shone, Shed into me a tempest of vitality And riches of reality, And while it breathed Upon me I was caught and carried up, As rapt with some intoxicating cup, And mixed with her and with her life enwreathed. I saw The meaning and the might of law, The miracle and mystery In all their history Of all high things that harass souls of men, Laid bare before me in the light of love With beauty so terrifical And bliss magnifical, That in a flash of wonder every ken Stood out like steps of fire to God above. And when she laid Voluptuous warm hands O'erfull of passion and of utter purity Upon my burdened brow— And when she said In words that with their brightness were obscurity Unspeakable great thoughts, that ranged all lands And seas divided by the venturous prow, And reached through all futurity— I was afraid. But when she set her quickening lipson mine In the full rapture of their rhythmic flame, That seemed to twine And in the shadow shine About the hidden bases of my frame, And mould it into something new, the same As hers and half divine, New courage came. And with the glow of that creative kiss Unclosing to me all the wells of bliss, A voice that sounded every height Of light, And every deep Where nought is made amiss That brings the vision of the heaven called sleep, Spoke to me of the height and the abyss. “For ever now thy life is sealed And healed Of sorrow with no morrow but the day That tricks in suffering even the noontide ray, And sickness with the saddening blot Or spot Of trouble which is double with the shame Not less a burden if it bears no name, A living part of human things If wings And flying with vain trying to the morn So big with blossom though it gives but thorn, Which is earth's dark exiguous lot— A spot Which nowise may by mortals be forgot, And to their brightest grandeur clings And stings. Henceforth thine cannot be a sordid choice, Since thou hast seen my face and heard my voice; But with my being thou art bathed And swathed, And cleansed from all the coarse and common dust With all the keen corroding rust Of lust, Uplifted to the same sublimer goal And gathered in a kindred whole And soul, Which blends thee with me in a kindred trust Beyond each flitting shape and gust, And must. For thou hast fully seen In all her stature Unveiled the awful Queen And naked Nature, And known the secret sight Not known to learning But granted to the might Of maiden yearning, And felt my fervent lips' Sweet palpitation In ecstasy's eclipse And education, To thine in living breath Divinely married In rapture that were death, If long they tarried. And thou hast drunken deep The mystic torrent, And wakest not to weep In strife abhorrent, Washed in the quickening waves That purge the mortal, To others only graves, To thee life's portal. And now Behold the blessed truth that turns The lock of every riddle, on the brow Of wrinkled age Or writ on funeral urns Or scarlet lips just opening the first page Of purest passion In its fiery fashion, Or dimpled baby hands that clasp another's Who one mad moment has the hungry fill That is a mother's Then unclaspt are still. Behold, The secret of the world is sex En, amor regit omnia, vivat rex! And thus the gray and old Are turned to gold, By union and communion of the parts Divided but then guided by their hearts That never can be cold, And shaped anew Of fire and dew In the same magic mould. And thus from wedded grace, Come fruits and flowers Through shining showers, When heaven and earth embrace; When pleasure meets with pain, And life and death Unite their breath, The man is born again. From kissing seas and strands, That kiss and quarrel With waves and coral, Uprise new forms and lands. And rules in all the fates The sexual thirst, Which from the first Creates and recreates. This quickens every gloom, And rolls afar The radiant star, And makes the crimson bloom. Behold, This is the universal law, Stamped on the petty straw And on the planet, And in the frailest fibre of each fold Whereby all textures hold, And in the awe And miracle of earth since God began it. This is the rule Of every gas And mass And in the movement of each molecule, The sexual plea Compelling every atom, That thrills a cosmic system or a sea, The lily on the lea, A churl or Chatham; Behind the theologian's bloody articles And forms of iron As in the pink siren, And in the mystic strife and dance of particles Repelling and attracting Each and all, In ever-interacting Rise and fall And ebb and flow That quiver to and fro, This turns the white cheek ruddy On the maid Who lingers with her love yet half afraid, And on the peach that fires the garden wall, And frames the study Of some saintly Paul, An antechamber to the bliss Of heaven, With all its holy leaven In one kiss. This makes the road so mired less muddy, Brings The ragged beggars purple robes of kings And crowns, And wipes away the bloody Frowns From garments rolled in battle; And a child Can draw By the sweet tether of its law And tender prattle Bosoms rude and wild, And fiercest cattle Home subdued and mild. The harlot steps that clamber To the bed Beneath the moon's white witness calm and still, The bloom that is a bridal chamber Shed Even as you clasp it at your careless will; The baby form that shows A face averted— A bond asserted, As the sunrise glows; The crash of antlered heads, The lone dark stations Which duty treads, The chemist's combinations, The rush of elements and souls That marry, The force that conquers and controls Prince Harry— They all are one, And all alike are done In man and metal By the same sweet yoke That woke A great peninsula or petal. The sexual fire That roses morning's brows And bows And tames the Titan's awful ire, Illumes the glow-worm's lamp And sets its stamp Upon the flies that deck The snowy deck And midnight tresses of the beauteous Mexican, And strikes its flame Of glorious burning shame In the crabbed student at his musty lexicon. Two portions of one Broken Heart, His Heart, God set apart, Who fashioned earth and all And set eternity in great and small For man to win And find himself therein With God; And by the blessed light of love Whereby he trod, Which bound in one bright tether Though parted things below and things above, He bade man draw (By that benignant law) All things alike in earth and heaven together Closer and closer still; That God and man And Nature With the one same legislature Might so be one in will And perfect being, And one in seeing In the shade and shine, By the great sexual human thirst divine.” She spoke, and all the wonder Of all flowers With flushes drawn from under By warm showers, Flashed out in fire asunder All their powers Above her and around her, And the rose With crimson wreaths enwound her White repose. But from her golden tresses Fell a rain Of lilies, like caresses Sweet as pain. And in her conquering glances Glowed the light And love of all romances And delight. And, lo, the sound of thunder Of far climes, And music with the plunder From all times! She breathed on me the story Of the lands, And bathed me in the glory Of her hands; She clothed me with her kisses And her grace, And steeped me in the blisses Of her face; Till in me dawned the seeing Beyond strife, And through me glowed the being Of all life. But then at last The Vision past, And left A rose at rest Upon my breast Bereft. And still at morn I know the thorn Must be, And when it burns That face returns To me. And all the world is that one glorious sight, And all the world is fire and dew and light. THE ARCHITEKTON. Day by day the fabric rose Rich in marble court and column, Very calm and white and solemn, In a rapture of repose And a beauty That seemed duty, Just as flowers in spring unclose. Line on line The splendour sprang, Shaped into a holy shrine, Earthly half and half divine; Leaf with blossom did entwine; Though no clink of chisel rang Nor the clang Of any hammer, With its clamour Talking in its eager tones To the echoes and the stones; Never tool, Used in any sculptor's school, Sounded forth Messages to south or north, Playing brightly, Straying lightly On a bevelled edge or curve, That a hair's breadth would not swerve. Stone on stone The fabric stept, Always higher, Always nigher To the stars upon their throne, Which above it sleepless kept Watch alone, When mortals slept; While the Architekton wept. Mortals ate and drank and married And about the winecup tarried Sad and soiled, While the maker of it toiled Day and night and upward carried Still his thought, And grimly wrought As for life In an ecstasy of strife. No one heard The temple grow, Though all heaven itself was stirr'd And it mounted ever on, Perfect as a Parthenon White as snow, Washed in sunset's crimson glow; As in silence the adept Worked and wept With glorious tears, Hopes and fears Whose lightning spears, Stabbed and stoled the dolorous years; And men crept; Till to light each turret leapt. No one heard The builded word, No one saw The gates of gold, Wonderful without a flaw And obedient to its law Like the gates of dawn unfold In expectancy and pride, Which for God himself divide, When He treads across the sky Out of gloom Into day's young rosy room, Through His calm eternity, Here in gleam And there in glimmer, Like a dream Now bright, now dimmer. No one saw The scene of awe. No one felt A poet dwelt Royally among the rabble That could only buzz and babble, Steal and smite And bark and bite And in dirty pleasures dabble; As he moved In mystic way, As he proved The iron and clay, Fashioning with love profuse And his skill Each old abuse And grey ill, From above reborn again Out of death in fiery pain, To the wonder of his will; While he knelt Before the shrine And became himself divine. No one felt, What love he dealt. No one knew The dreadful dew, Blood and tears and burning sweat Wherewith course on course was set, Arch on arch In upward march, Till in crowning grace they met In the wedlock of the arts, Breathing passion through all parts; While it flashed Aloft like flame, And was dashed Through its white frame With the light of sun and moon And the stars when night has noon, And was splashed With other rays Like the glow of bygone days. No one knew, The way it grew, No one cared How ill he fared, When the poet's life was smitten And the shadow of a ban Passing fell athwart the plan Which upon his heart was written; While he spent himself for men, In a more than cosmic ken, Drawing riches From all lands, For proud niches Where calm hands Moved and moulded, And unfolded Leaf and bosom Of pure blossom, Bud and bristle Of the thistle, And the smile of angel faces Peeping from the thorns' embraces, And the glimpse of sudden feet In their naked beauty sweet. No one cared, What deeds he dared. Yet each day from some new spiracles Breathed new miracles, As the fabric spread through space, Hourly soared and gathered grace From the noonshine And the moonshine, From the motion Of the ocean, From the freshness of the air When the morning In adorning Laughs to find itself so fair; Dim with porches Deep in shade, Where red torches Figures made. O the joys above and under, As if heaven were burst asunder! Corridors that ran for ever In the flight Of marble might With an infinite endeavour, Through the marvel of the mazes' Mystic sight, Now in blackness, now in blazes Of fierce light; Vestibules with veiled portals Opening into chambers vast, Where immortals Might recline at God's repast; Jewelled chairs, And stately stairs Climbing by degrees of glory Through their stages Like a story Stamped in mighty marble pages, From the mint Of imperishable print. Yet invisibly it grew, Yet inaudibly it towered As it flowered, As it drew All the glamour of the rose, All the freshness of the dew When the pearly dawn is new, All the world of white repose In the lilies which disclose Secrets only breathed to few, Every bloom And every gloom, Cloud and light And day and night, Virgin leaves And yellow sheaves, Sun and showers And snowy bowers, Madness, mirth And fiery leaven, All the poetry of earth, All the ecstasies of heaven— All those to itself it drew, As it grew And great branches outward threw. No one heeded, No one stood Wondering before the pile, Though the lands its lessons needed And the smile Vesting it like maidenhood, Rippling down each rosy aisle Touched with sunset's lingering guile. But the Master Toiled the faster, For he knew Art was long and life was brittle— Life was little, And disaster To the rocks of ruin blew, If men nodded And but plodded Though with wings that heavenward flew. And at times The great Architekton caught The far chimes Of grand past ages, Grace unsought And gifts unbought By mere wages, And enwove them in his song With a music low and long, New and old, Marvellous and manifold: With the echoes sounding on, Sounding on And leaping, talking, Running, walking, Climbing, creeping, Laughing, weeping, Flying, calling, Rising, falling, Now aloud, then mild and meek As they played at hide and seek Round the corners, In the shimmer and the shade Of the ghostly colonnade, Merry here and there as mourners Sad and low And soft and slow, Up and down and to and fro, Through the pillared portico; Then with sighing And with crying, And the whisper As of some wee baby lisper, Dying, dying, dying, dying, All in play And far away, Far away. For many nations, Many æons, Dirges, lullabies and pæans In his harmony were one; And he laid the vast foundations Of those flame-like exaltations In his eldest dearest son; And the gates Arose like fates All insatiable in hunger, And devoured At last the younger Only thus with blood endowered; As in ages long ago, Long ago, Builded under night and noon, Builded to the magic moon, Hiel raised his Jericho; While the palm trees' stately bound Stood like sentinels around, And the roses flashed like fire In their red and white attire, And the Moab mountain's hue In the distance Dim as fairy land's existence Melted blue. So the Architekton wrought Thrones of thought And for sacramental wine Chiseled chalice, Pure, divine, And solemn tables Starting out from sudden gables, Though the malice As of destiny withstood, In his holy hardihood. And his knife With separation's Consecrations Spared not treasure, time or toil, Love or life— Built his being and his heart (Burning like the sacred oil) With the cunning of his art Wooed as passion wooes a wife— Built the calmness and the strife And the spoil Of every feeling (As he laboured, fighting, kneeling) In each part, throughout the whole, Till the splendid work was finished And no more From his great store Could be added, nought diminished, And it was a living soul. Then he bade The people enter Through a hundred carven doors, Each a centre Of the goldshine and goldshade, Where the floors Ran in marble left and right Warm and wonderful and bright, Spreading spaciously Until graciously Lost in light; Where the fountains leapt and luted To each other's Strains as brothers, With the flitting birds that fluted Notes that tingled And that mingled With the waves that soared and sang, Till the roof with music rang. There the hall Serene and tall Stretched its thousand stately pillars White and strong And proud and long, As if stepping to a song And the highest art's fulfillers, In its royalty of room With its riches all abloom By the birds like lightning crost And with flowers like coloured snow Torn and tost And paved below; While clear faces calm and grave, Poet and philosopher, From the chastened chapiter And the august architrave Looked in love From bliss above. But the people mouthed and mocked, As they flocked To the wonder of his art, Wherein he had wrought his heart And his life; And they murmured, “Give us bread, Give us butter, And the blessings of the gutter; For the world is over rife With cathedral forms and fables And their parts; We would rather styes and stables Than your arts.” So they turned away in scorn From that miracle of grace, And the new and fairer morn; Clouds fell on the Poet's face; Every thought became a thorn, And his birth his burying place. Wealth and wisdom, toil and time, All he was and all he had, Chant of battle, ocean chime, Treasure plucked from every clime, Truths that leave the bosom glad, Summer's breath And life and death, Spells that make a people mad With the might Of pure delight, Met and mingled in the glory And the gloom Of his great story, Clasping heaven with sacred tie, Though it only told his doom— Though it only was his tomb; But it lived, and cannot die. EASTER EVE. It was Easter eve in a late late year When the birds had gone to bed, And the lily dropt a glorious tear But the white rose it turned red; On the pansy fell a sudden fear, And the thorn forgot the spite That had armed it with a cruel spear, And the red rose it turned white. Lo, the Master in His beauty came With His risen meed of might, And the flowers before Him flashed like flame And the grass leapt into light; For His Presence turned the wild thing tame, And the trees around Him felt A rapture that was akin to shame, And the daisies to Him knelt. O the green leaves blossomed by Him blest And their fragrant life gave up, And the lichen laughed in its shadowed rest And upraised its crimson cup; While the clover with its bleeding breast Laid bare the honeyed heart, And the creatures closer to Him prest For they all in Him had part. Then the Master plucked of the fairest flowers, And upon His bosom laid The tansy drank of His wondrous powers, Till it blushed as if half afraid; As He sought the abyss of blasted bowers Where the lost in anguish lie, And His roses fell like refreshing showers On the death that cannot die. But the roses' thorns were about His head, And the lily in His hand Like a sacred cross of glory spread, That relaxed each burning band; And the damned looked up at His loving tread Which a rainbow round it cast, And remembered not that they were dead For a moment, as He past. Ah, the red flames licked His holy feet As they moved in mercy on, And His pathway like a golden street In the heavenly city shone; And the lurid shroud like a bridal sheet Over tortured beings fell, And the pains for a moment then were sweet In the cursed heart of Hell. THE SECRET. 'Twas dusk, and one was walking by my side In all the glorious dawn Of maiden joy— The blessed inextinguishable pride From heavenly fountains drawn, Divinely coy. But neither spoke, though music more than sound And more than studied arts With every power, Flowed from the silence with the darkness wound, Until our wedded hearts Burst into flower. And then the ages backward roll'd their gates Of endless space and time, And truth unsought With all the wonders of all worlds and fates Met in one perfect chime, A single thought. And we beheld the secret treasured long, Through golden mists of centuries and song. THE DAFFODIL. When a verdure clothes the hill, Comes the yellow Daffodil, Daffodil, Daffodil; Bowing to the icy blast Oft with snow about it cast, Breathing stories of the past; Brightly nodding To the plodding Gardener at his daily toil, Till the sunset on the hill; Like a king to scatter spoil, Turning into gold the soil; Though it's but the Daffodil, Daffodil, Daffodil. When in music leaps the rill, Laughs the yellow Daffodil, Daffodil, Daffodil; Though in March is bitter air And it has no sheltered lair, Laughs to find itself so fair; Gently lisping With its crisping Stalks to any idle gust Or the ripples of the rill, In a sweet and simple trust Lisping just because it must And it is the Daffodil, Daffodil, Daffodil. With a balm for every ill, Blows the yellow Daffodil, Daffodil, Daffodil; Give me not the cursed gold Making hearts of pity cold And the face of childhood old; But the metal Of its petal, Better far than precious ore With a freshness above ill Which the mint of Nature bore To enrich our treasure store; Yes, we love the Daffodil, Daffodil, Daffodil. Wildly let it grow at will, Bless the yellow Daffodil, Daffodil, Daffodil; For it takes no common part With a beauty more than art, And is rooted in our heart; While the pages Of the ages, If they blazon feast or fight Chronicles of strength or skill Never miss thine Eden light Which leaves wood and meadow bright, Home more home, dear Daffodil, Daffodil, Daffodil. A DIRTY NIGHT. “A Dirty Night” the coastguard said! I leaned into the dark And stabbed the shadows with quick looks Too fond to be afraid, That read the farthest flickering spark As written broad in books. Where was my child, my sailor boy, My light, my life, my only joy, Who early sailed that morning My dread of danger scorning, As if the ocean were his toy, In all his young adorning? His kiss was tingling on my brow— I feel it now, Though fifty empty years have past Nor brought at last Beneath the blue or clouded dome My darling home. It was a dreadful night, the surf Drove inland far on tree and turf, And scared the seabirds flew All draggled shoreward As I gazed nor'ward, The blast so fiercely blew; With slant wings rumpled And feathers crumpled, As higher still it grew. A horror from the break of day Upon me like the sunset lay, And as I leaned into the night Which my great famished love made bright, I would the billows Were my pillows To bear me to my heart's delight. The hungry waves Seemed rolling graves Heaped high above the myriads fled, Who voyaged forth nor dreamed of wrack But never to their own came back, And now were numbered with the dead. And where was he So dear to me, Who gaily sallied out to roam Upon the cruel climbing foam, As bold and bright As morning's light Athwart his yellow native loam? I saw no sign But gloom malign On the horizon and the sea, My breast was numb, And heaven seemed dumb To my heart-broken voiceless plea. I gave the passing coastguard hail And told him of the lingering sail That soon must bring my darling back; He turned a troubled eye on me, And slewing slowly on his track, “It is a dirty night,” said he. THE BABY PILGRIMS. I saw the Baby Pilgrims pass As walking upon air, The snowflakes falling on the grass Were not so soft and fair; Their little feet Made music sweet That filled the land with laughter, And as they trod The blighted sod Burst into green thereafter. I saw them when a little child, And as they journeyed forth they smil'd At me with tender Sudden splendour, That broke through precious pearly tears; And in a moment all the years Gave up the secret of their fears, And hate grew tender; The future, with its soldier's march Of feasts and fights And days and nights In mixed delights, Before me stood a rainbow arch— A rainbow arch. I saw them once, I saw them twice, With lilies in their train And fragrance as of Orient spice— I saw them yet again; Their little frames Like carven flames Had an exceeding glory, And their great eyes Were mysteries Of some unearthly story. And where they stept the poorest earth Forgot its pining and its dearth, And from its bosom Poured the blossom Of whitest flowers with honey cup, Whereof the angels well might sup— Yes, lilies at their feet sprang up, With virgin bosom. I saw them, when a fiery youth With fearless grip On Beauty's hip And thirsty lip, I tore the veil from naked Truth— From naked Truth. Once more, when in the toiling mass I hardly held my own, I saw the Baby Pilgrims pass, So sweet and so unknown. Their little hands Were golden bands And with my hands seemed mingled, Each little breast To mine seemed prest And through me throbbed and tingled; Their forms were beautiful and bare, And grim as darkness every care Died at their blessing And caressing; As heart to heart, and face to face, This mortal flesh and spirit grace Met in one warm and long embrace And found one blessing. But now that shadows round me creep With coming night, Those beings bright And more than sight Are drawing near, and mix with sleep— And mix with sleep. THE LIVING DEAD. They are not dead, they cannot die— They cannot die, If low their frames in ashes lie; For nought can loose the spirit tie, Which links in more than marriage bond This death-like life and life beyond That is not dead, Though it has fled And we who linger may despond, Who hunger for the golden head— The golden tresses And caresses, That mixed with ours like woven fire, The heart's delight, the mind's desire; They are not dead, it cannot be, And spirit evermore must live However far and fugitive; And yet again these eyes shall see The clinging hands Not now to meet, Whose clasp was sweet, As soft commands, And little feet— And little feet. Ah, nought can quench the spirit life, The spirit life That yields to vulgar toil and strife, Wherewith this weary world is rife, A portion of its inmost grace And overflows on earth a space, And lends the eyes The light of skies, That breaks like sunrise on the face And only like the sunset flies. If we go mating, They keep waiting In other lands for our lost love, Which draws them oft from Heaven above; They do not die, it cannot be; For spirits wonderful and white Are as the Maker infinite And flit through æons fair and free. But yet we miss Your tender tread And welcome shed In looks that kiss, Ye living dead, Ye living dead. The spirit world, that only lives, That only lives, Which of its deathless beauty gives The dew of God's best donatives To all—the maiden's magic 'tire, The thought like some cathedral spire, The march of men With godlike ken, The primal pulsing cloud of fire, The dream in stone, the poet's pen. O they are twining Dear refining Threads of a subtle sunshine round, Wherewith our very souls are wound. From every height, from every deep, Within our cradles, at our graves, Their ministries like ocean waves Bathe these poor hearts with blessed sweep. For faithful still With presence fair As evening air, They always fill The empty chair— The empty chair. CLOUDLAND. Cloudland, Proud land, Up above the earth so high That the gates of Heaven seem nigh As the lover and his sigh, Cloudland; And the bee with honeyed thigh, Proud land, Cannot ever come to thee, Though he is so fair and free— May not rise bejond the bowers Of the flowers; And the daintiest daring bird Which the tallest tree has stirr'd Shall not reach thy cities thus With its powers; Though thou dost descend to us, In the beauty of bright showers. But the crossings And the tossings Of thy towers that form and flee, Cloudland, Are a riddle known to me, Proud land. Cloudland, Shroud land, Where the sunbeams climb and cling And the shadows shelter bring And the great sun's golden ring, Cloudland, Glimmers through thy silver wing, Shroud land. Ah, I know the hidden sight, And the other side of light, All the mystery and story Of thy glory; I have passed into the sky Which the bee and butterfly Cannot scale, the sunset red Like a gory Battle-field where hosts have bled, And the sunrise calm and hoary. Yes, the pages Of the ages And the future of the years, Cloudland, Lie beneath thy smiles and tears, Shroud land. Cloudland, Loud land, When the thunders in thy deep Bosom wake at last from sleep And the silent watch they keep, Cloudland, O in sudden wrath they sweep, Loud land! I can read their writing dim, As I hear the laughter grim Of the old imprisoned giant, Dark, defiant; While he feels his centuried pains, Fighting fiercely with his chains In the agony of storm, Pale and pliant To the fretting of his form, Bound but tameless and reliant. And his fetters' Lurid letters Spell to me a judgment psalm, Cloudland, Like a legend on God's palm, Loud land. Cloudland, Proud land, I am only happy when Fancy leaves this narrow pen And the sordid strife of men, Cloudland, For thy grander wider ken, Proud land; All things then are as I live— Only what I choose and give, Every truth is of my making Or my breaking, Just a toy that lightly stands For a moment in my hands, And is the next moment gone At the taking Of the whim that hastens on, And without the heart's least aching. So my fancies Weave romances Of thy shapes, new earth and skies, Cloudland, Blessed sweet hypocrisies, Proud land. SHE CAME. She came as gently as a dove, She came in white attire And maidenly desire, And simply said to all, “I love.” She spake to mighty men of old, She spake in palaces of gold Those words with their unearthly thrill, And drew her garments closer still. But no one listened to her voice, And no one heeded her. But gauds and gossamer, Were still the idols of their choice. Though down the corridors of time, Her footsteps rang a better chime; And here and there some gentle breast, Throbbed back the music on her breast. She vainly bent on camp and court Her pure face virginal, And trod the festival Where crownèd vice made virtue sport. She lay where homeless outcasts lie, She lay in bitter need With poverty for creed, And simply said to all, “I die.” She pleaded with the lost and poor, She pleaded at the cottage door The sentence of her solemn care, And laid her lily bosom bare. But no one harkened to her cry, And no one counted her A worthy sufferer, Although she mourned exceedingly. She showed her wounds, the sisters' dart That pierced her tortured bleeding heart, The white robes soiled with foreign stains, The soft arms bruised by brothers' chains. She vainly brought a balm for ill, To sweeten labour's lot And cleanse each ugly blot— She vainly lay and suffered still. THE YELLOW LEAF. My heart is cold, my hand forgets the cunning Which turned to beauty all it touched and made Sweet music out of silence, and set running Bright fountains in the shivering desert shade; I do not see the treasures that I did In stocks and stones, by fancy jewelled o'er, And at my step turned into costly store Upon my eager way of yesterday, With revelations all from others hid; My heart is cold, These eyes are sad and old, I have no fellow now the leaf is yellow. My mind is dark, and long hath lost the meaning Of life's dear mystery that once lured me on, And yet repelled me from the golden gleaning In miry street or pillared Parthenon; I am astray, a pilgrim without clue Tost up and down by every idle whim And beacons false that leave the path more dim That dazzled with its ray but yesterday, When all the heaven was one great rose of blue; My mind is dark And meets no guiding mark, I have no fellow now the leaf is yellow. My hope is faint, and builds no more the visions Of larger moments when the gates rolled back And bars went down before its conquering track, But round me close grey walls and blank derisions; The weeds are simple weeds, and do not rush To kingly robes of purple as I pass; I see no skies reflected on the grass Or common clay, as yesterday, And earth remembers not its maiden blush; My hope is faint And feels a mortal taint, I have no fellow now the leaf is yellow. My sun hath set, the near horizons darken With unfamiliar shadows that have grown To shapeless phantoms, but are still my own; I hear the winter's knell, and would not harken; The world seems dying with me, as I go Into the grave-like gloom, that opens arms To bury me with all those cheating charms That held their sweeter sway of yesterday, And silence settles on me like the snow; My sun hath set Although I linger yet, I have no fellow now the leaf is yellow. THE CROSS OF FIRE. From the wideness and the wonderment of Space, In the blindness of the lands, While the world apparelled in its virgin grace Lifted up to Heaven dumb hands; There was smoke upon the altar And a veil above the eyes And athwart the azure skies, Prayer was vain and seemed to palter With the flesh that could but falter Forth its heart in broken cries; Not one flash of simple truth a child might con, And more reverend age would fan To the fulness of a plan, Linking with his Maker man, No anointed guide to whisper, “Pass it on, Pass it on!” In the desert where he communed with the stars And the dreadful silence trod, Came the first glimpse as through iron prison bars Of the solemn Light called God, And the prophet's heart was shaken By the shadow which he saw, In the knowledge that was awe And when seen was not forsaken, While his life did all awaken To the Learning of the Law; And a Voice from out the Vision, as it shone With a glory not of earth, And around him threw a girth On the desolation's dearth, Breathed as softly as a secret, “Pass it on, Pass it on!” In the bondage and the burden of the years When in darkness rose the day, And with travail of the sacrificial fears Knelled the grim command to slay, Pealed the prophet's cry of thunder Down the ages with a call Laying low the barrier wall And red hands that gript their plunder, Till the darkness burst asunder Bringing rays of hope to all; And to bold disciples, ere his time had gone, He bequeathed the Torch of Flame And the one Mysterious Name Never to be dimmed by shame, And with dying accents murmured, “Pass it on, Pass it on!” In the visionary East where Truth was born Of the starshine and the streams, Where the Priest and Poet hailed the ruddy morn Through a mist of golden dreams; Rose the Fount of Fire in burning Bosoms which had bridled still Their indomitable will, With an upward spirit spurning Dust of earth and dimly turning To the knowledge that would kill, In the marble mystery called Babylon, When the soul's sublime pretence Sought and found its dark defence In a dead magnificence, Lo, the white-robed figures muttered, “Pass it on, Pass it on!” In the splendour of the speculative West, Where the busy curious brain Bodied airy thoughts and in a rapturous rest Beautified each pulse of pain; Soared the mind to nobler stature Wonderful and white and warm, Snow and peace and flower and storm Taken fresh from naked Nature, And with art's new legislature Moulded to a fairer form. On the pure stone pages of the Parthenon Beamed the holy Lamp of Light, Spreading wings more broad and bright Which essayed a loftier flight, And the builders proudly chanted, “Pass it on, Pass it on!” Oft it fell and faded, when it might not make Head against the ribald shout Hostile, but rekindled at the martyr's stake Never could it quite go out; Blood-stained fingers grasped the glory Of that heritage of Light In a second vaster sight, Rose red maidens sighed the story, And on heads of sages hoary Fell that calm and crownèd might; Kings assumed it as a mantle kings might don Grander than a royal dress, And it clothed the blank distress With its lines of loveliness, And the mouths of infants babbled, “Pass it on, Pass it on!” Still in vestal purity and humble heart And from children's prayerful eyes Leapt the Truth, and made with more than art Greener earth and bluer skies; Lisping lips, and meditation Of grey seers who wove of Time All its secrets in one chime, Bards whose night was revelation, Saints with awful consecration, Silence, left it more sublime. Fed by faith, enriched with doubts august it shone Forth a living Cross of Fire, With an infinite desire Ever upward to aspire, And the world, like rolling waves cried, “Pass it on, Pass it on!” THE RIVER OF TEARS. I came to the River of Tears, Where the maidens watched and wept And the thistles with threatening spears Through the shivering shadows crept. I said to myself, “I will track This dolorous tide to its source, I will follow the windings back By the snares of the snaky course.” But the thorns arose in their might And they thrust with maligant arms, And white bosoms of warm delight Met mine with voluptuous charms. And white hands like the clambering vine With the scent of the drowsy grape, Caught my own, and through dews divine Burst the bloom of each shining shape. But I hurried along in haste, Though the small feet glimmered white And the sinuous easy waist Had a joy that was infinite. While the languorous hot breath came And went on my very cheek, And the lips with their scarlet flame Made my purpose wan and weak. O the bliss of the fragrant face, O, the passion of clinging hands, O the madness of naked grace In the loves of those poppied lands! But I passed through the purple air And the limbs that disdained their 'tire, And the gold of the gloried hair, Like a brand redeemed from fire. I refused the eyes, though they flashed With a cruel and conquering light, Through their curtains heavily lashed, In the quest of a vaster sight. They were only a dream to me, A dream of the summer south, Bare shoulder and amorous knee And the ravishing rosy mouth. So I came to the Holy Mount, In a dim and delicious land; And lo, there was a silvery Fount That gushed from a Baby's hand. And I said to myself, “O this At last is the blessed Source Of the tide with the sad abyss, And its never-ending course; I have traversed the world of the dead And the world of the beautiful fears, I have come to the solemn head Of the sacred River of Tears.” But the Baby pointed up To the misty peaks of blue, For the hand with its lily cup Was not the rejoicing clue. So I looked, and again the stream Brake full on my troubled gaze, Like a ghastly tide in a dream That is seen through a mocking haze. But the pathway grew to a height And the bounding walls were steep, And the waves in their weary flight Did nothing but wail and weep. And I struggled yet sternly on Up the arduous narrowing space, Through the garish gleam that shone, Like the smile on a dying face. And the rocks were terrible swords As if human flesh were sweet, And the briars were gins and cords That gript at my tottering feet. And they turned into loathsome shapes, Now in glimmer and now in gloom, As if scowling fiends or apes Were shutting me in to doom; Till I closed my desperate eyes With the torturing stress and strain, For the lurid and scornful skies Beat down on my haunted brain. Then I came with my burden of care To a bar on the bitter road, Where a skeleton bleached and bare Lay crushed by a heavier load; And a gurgling groaning thread Trickled down, but could scarce escape From the mouldering sides of the dead, As it rotted with ribs agape. And I said to myself, “At length I arrive at the evil Source, Which saps our desires and strength With the blight of its barren course; For here in this mortal mass Is the taint of the murmuring years, That smothers the smiles that pass With the rolling River of Tears.” But a fleshless hand uprose, While the bones with a gruesome thrill Seemed to sigh in their grim repose, And it pointed me forward still. Yes, it beckoned me higher yet To the home of the thunder cloud, Where the sun was about to set In the shade of a crimson shroud. But now I could hardly scale The fence of the iron crags, As they loomed before me pale With their horrible juts and jags. And the lightning leapt and fell On the track of the trembling peaks, Till I seemed like a soul in hell In the rain that the judgment wreaks; For it toyed with my draggled hair And I bathed in the quivering fire, While the boding sulphurous air Was the breath of a funeral pyre. But above me yet the tide Dropt down in a dwindling flood, From the toppling mountain side In a blazing streak of blood. I could scarcely climb and crawl Up the threatening thwart sheer path, That rose a forbidding wall With ruin and woe and wrath. But I still toiled feebler on With trouble of foot and hand, Till the setting sun was gone Burnt out like a smouldering brand. And I said to myself, “The Night With its cloak is the fatal Source, I have followed the stream aright Through the maze of its upward course; In its mould is the mischief cast Of the withering joys and ears, I have solved the riddle at last And the truth of the River of Tears.” But from out of the shadowy womb With its terrors grim and great, As a voice from a sealed tomb Came a message of fearful fate. And the lightning made a sign With its crooked finger of red, And it scrabbled a score malign On the darkness overhead; And it pointed me still more far To the infinite depths of Space, To the dim and distant star And the planet's dwelling place. So I mounted the ladder of air, And it felt beneath my feet Like the steps of a giant stair Where the stone of the iron meet. But the stream was my comrade still With its gossamer thread of fire, Like an almost viewless rill Or the ghost of a dead desire. And the breezes buoyed me up When I stumbled upon the brink, And the cloud was an ebon cup That gave of its treasures to drink. Lo, my weakness passed away And my paces refused to halt, As I climbed without one delay To the purple spangled vault. For the waft as of sweeter lips And the hold as of stronger hands, Dispelled the last weary eclipse, While I traversed those wonder lands. Till at last in my journey I came To a marvellous Gate of Light, And a bubbling Fount of Flame That arose from the realms of Night. But, behold, as I stricken stopt, At the porch of the blasting flood, From the dreadful threshold dropt Little globes as of living blood. And I said to myself, “Ah, here Lies the seat of the very Source, In the breast of the burning sphere, Is unravelled the endless course; I see the beginning of all The sorrow that flows and sears, I descry the fount of the fall Of the terrible River of Tears.” But then from the mystery broke The sound of a sudden breath, And the awful Silence spoke The enigma of life and death. “The stream has the blessed start That you sought, as you blindly trod, In the riven and bleeding Heart Of the homeless crucified God.” NATURE'S SECRET. I asked the red rose, how its colour came From cold black earth in blushing robes of flame; I asked the lily, how the snood of snow Grew on its dewy form from death below; I asked the violet, how it got the scent Which touched our souls like some sweet instrument; I asked the leaf, how to that living green Laboratories toiled with hand unseen; I asked the poet, how he caught the song Which to its music rolled the world along; I asked the speaker, how his dream's desire Like lightning flashed and set the earth afire; I asked the soldier, how his conquering sword Razed mountains in the battles of the Lord; I asked the woman, how her scarlet lips Wrought mischief more than earthquake and eclipse; I asked the baby, how it drew the trust Which leapt to God like incense from the dust; I asked the ocean, how it won the grace Of freedom shadowed in a maiden's face; I asked the heart, how rose the hungering cry That nought could answer but Eternity; And one response from all in concert fell, “We know the secret but we cannot tell.” MY CASTLE IN THE AIR. When the duty now seems double And my buoyant hope takes flight, While the shadow as of night Makes the pastime toil and trouble; When no service brings me joy And the rapid Stream runs vapid, And a plaything is no toy; Then with all my griefs and crosses Once so welcome and so fair, Off I fly with loves and losses To my Castle in the Air. If the task that was a pleasure Palls upon my weary brain, And the old delicious pain Of pursuing yields no treasure; If the sacramental cup Of afflictions' Benedictions As pure bitterness foams up; Then from every bane and burden That with bliss no longer pair, Off I fly for other guerdon To my Castle in the Air. Should my children be too fretful And the dreary hours drag by, Each like an eternity, And good fortune pass forgetful; Should the sun be clouded quite And the noonrise, Pale as moonrise, Or the lily not look white; Then from earth and all its minions, Busy street and climbing stair, Off I fly on eagle pinions To my Castle in the Air. Do the cares that come to gladness As with roses wed the thorn And the mist enwraps the morn, Bow my mirth to thoughts of madness? Do the prizes pierce my hand, While ambition Proves perdition, And the crowning is a brand? Then from all the frantic hurry Of our modern Mammon's lair, Off I fly beyond the worry To my Castle in the Air. When the balm of high anointing Ceases to assuage my breast, And the fever of unrest Burns with dreadful disappointing; When the colour leaves the flower, And the starlit Eyes and scarlet Lips desert my lady's bower; Off I fly from fading visions And the empty heart or chair, With their mockings and derisions, To my Castle in the Air. If the faces long so kindly, Which I could not but adore, Smile not now as heretofore, And away from me turn blindly; If the hand, with kissing clasp Of warm fingers, No more lingers All responsive in my grasp; Then to brightness ever beaming, And to beauty ever fair, Off I fly on clouds of dreaming To my Castle in the Air. Do not ask me where the column Of my calm and cloistered seat, In its rapturous retreat, Rises white and pure and solemn; Do not lightly seek to guess, Where these graces' Pleasant places Sleep in languid loveliness; When my joy runs high, or only Deeps beneath me sigh despair, Off I fly aloft and lonely To my Castle in the Air. THE DARK ANGEL. In the fair and free beginning of the bright and happy years, I was born in shine and shadow Of the mountain and the meadow, With the lisping as of laughter, and a trouble as of tears. Ah, the prophet found me helpful and the priest he bound me slave, And in temples dim and awful With their bloody rites unlawful I was present at the sacrifice and dug the victim's grave. Out of ghastly groves that stretched strange arms and reared a horrid head Making dusky court and column, With a murmur sad and solemn I arose in garments grey and held my converse with the dead. Weeping mothers knew and cursed me as they heard my trailing robe, When it rustled round the bosom With its lily baby blossom, As I came in mournful mission for the treasures of the globe. And the children fled with seared and sobbing breasts when I drew near From my ghostly track of terror, And the foot that with no error Strode straight onward though through iron ranks of clashing sword and spear. But I see nought of the sadness with these eyes bereaved and blind, And from trodden paths of duty Yet I reap my bliss and beauty, Though I leave such ruined homes, and scared and broken hearts behind. I am simply a Dark Angel and must go where I am bid On my errand long and lonely, Up and down the earth, and only In the curtained haunts of twilight and the tomb or coffin-lid. And I strike in love and mercy and the majesty of strength, Just to make the heedless careful Or the ribald lips more prayerful And to light the world with vigils through its corridors at length. If I bring but shade and sorrow and my trembling touch is cold And to weakness gloom and anguish, While the little flowerets languish At my breath, it is because my sleepless frame is thin and cold. But I am the foe of sickness and I ever fight with sin On my veiled and endless journey, Like a knight who rides a tourney For the beautiful and noble and is sure that he must win. Though I forage oft with famine and the pestilence and blood And red clouds of wrathful sunset, And no night can stay my onset, Yet I fill the shrines with suppliants and cleanse the tainted flood. For where love is baulked or powerless I know my task, I hear, And from stormy deeps or stillness In the brooding hour of illness I awake, with all my scourges of the Night—for I am FEAR. THE RULING PASSION. I have one passion and no more, Not yearning for loud fame, To strive as fools have striven before Who left a moment's name Inscribed on sand With futile hand, That only showed their shame And nothing worthy to adore; I cared not for the loves of lasses, Ambition or red wine, Or vulgar homage of the masses That wallowed as the swine. When others on the muddy wave Of grovelling rose to power, I could not be a party slave, I loathed the sordid dower Of office won By evil done That burst in fatal flower— I would not dig my country's grave; I scorned the common steps of meanness, And braved my fellows' frown Who through dishonour and uncleanness Won ruin and renown. I had one passion and no more, That flashes through my life— To add a little to the store Of human wealth and strife; Although I gave Unto the grave Or sacrificial knife Myself, to get one grain of ore; I kissed the cross, I hugged the fetter And brake the virgin soil, That I might leave one heart-beat better This world of grinding toil. And none has ever worked in vain Who nursed the generous plan, To ease the burden and the pain Of his poor brother man, Or shed on night One ray of light Though in a cottage span, When sad eyes kindled back again; Not if a single line or sentence Has waked the woman's part, And struck the chord of mute repentance In some lost sister's heart. I have one passion and no more, It is my vital breath— To find a medicine for some sore Or throw a simple wreath, Though but on one Brute thing foredone, Yet dignified by death And the great suffering that it bore; And if one note of mine made living More beautiful and young For any soul, that sought forgiving, I have not idly sung. God is my judge, not purblind men, How I have handled long The poet's lute, the writer's pen, Who had no choice but song; And if I erred In careless word, The tune was never wrong, Though rudely chanted now and then: My record may be blurred and blotted By many a grievous fall, But yet I walked my path allotted Predestinate in all. I had one passion and no more, My purpose and my pride, To break the shadow on that shore Which is the other side; If I might raise By prayer or praise, Those curtains that divide The orbed truth from earth-bound lore; I struggled on when flesh turned craven Within my own weak breast, To lead my fellows to the Haven Where I may never rest. And well I know, by torrents crost, By desert toil and fast, No tiniest labour can be lost And nothing said is past; For effort's deeds Are deathless seeds, Even though they blossom last By all the waves and weathers tost; And who shall brand with taunt or stigma These feet that darkly trod, If I in singing life's enigma Echoed one thought of God? CROSSING THE THRESHOLD. I was resolved to do this thing, or die— To face the terrors that before us lie, And cross the threshold of the silent Porch Alone, unarmed, and with no certain torch But courage. How could I live tamely on, And tread the dreary road that fools had gone For centuries of vegetable life, When all above and all around was rife With larger other pulses than our own? For what was best and brightest was unknown, And nothing hindered but the human tie— I was resolved to do this thing, or die. I was resolved to do this thing, or die— Not simply in the vulgar round to vie With groundlings for each common grace or gift; But somehow somewhere to find out a rift Between this world and that uncharted shore Which opens once to all nor opens more And enter through the unutterable shade, If every power of heaven and earth forbade; And with the conquering thought that seemed to give The strength desired, I entered and did live, And saw what is not seen by mortal eye— I was resolved to do this thing or die. THE BRIDGE OF DREAD. Horror and grief and sin, madness and murk and woe Walled me around and in, shutting inside the foe; One little way led out forth from the ghastly gloom, Through silent doors of doubt over the Bridge of Doom; Under the sword of fire waving across the dead, Barring the brave desire—over the Path of Dread. Ray of hope glimmered not in shadow far and near, All behind was a blot, all before was a fear; Lingering, I must go deeper in mire of shame; If I went, down below darker the curded flame Combed into locks of night; thin as a needle's thread, Hardly a streak of light, quivered the Path of Dread. Ah, could I dare to stop seeing the wrath come nigh, Seeing the judgment drop as my offence ran high? Furies in secret force, terror with gnawing fangs, Guilt and divine remorse drove me with hungry pangs Out of the hateful past haunting with houndlike tread, On to the plunge at last over the Path of Dread. Then as I trod at length lightly upon the Bridge, Under my foot a strength rose like a mountain ridge; Firm as a paven road sprang what had seemed a hearse, Meet to uplift the load of a great universe; Now the grim die was cast, no more a flimsy thread But as a highway vast, opened the Path of Dread. FOLLOW THY STAR. It may be in the morning and it may be at the noon, It may be with the evening late, But surely will the Vision come if it should not come soon To every heart that fronts its fate; O when it draweth near or when it summons thee from far, Be equal to the appointed time Nor dazzled by a devious chime, And bravely to the end of things just follow thy own star— But not another's, though a brother's— The very one that since thy birth Has still been gleaming through thy dreaming To guide thee to the harbour safe across the homeless earth. A thousand thousand goodly orbs are burning in the sky And each is beautiful to see, And some have thrones and some on wings of glory seem to fly, But there is only one for thee; O if it smileth as to make or frowneth as to mar, Remember it is truly thine And for no alien lot may shine— Be patient the allotted hours, and follow thy own star; Yet not the fairest one or rarest That beckons from a brighter zone, But this that beauty gives to duty And from eternity was meant for none but thee alone. Thine may be but a little light a quiet course to run, A cottage lamp that flecks the floor; It may be lavish with its beams and blazing as a sun, That opens into dreadful Space a door; O should it be a glow-worm faint or comet's awful car, Be ready for the certain call That speaks in music once to all, And listen not to lesser signs and follow thy own star; But not a neighbour's, though thy labours Have helped to kindle it and thrown Love's blessed jewel as its fuel— And be content and do not track a beacon save thy own. New systems rise, old systems set, and other rays are dear And in the upper ocean swim, While fresh horizons from the womb of Time at last appear And our great heavens shall yet grow dim; But O there is no mortal bound, there is no prison bar For thee, if thou wilt simply heed No rival splendours in thy need, And in the day and in the night just follow thy own star; Though troubles darken to it hearken, And tread the pathway hope has trod, For though in deepest hell thou sleepest Still it will guide thee home at last unto thyself and God. WIND OF THE IRON PEAKS. Wind of the iron peaks, wind of the northern sky Bearing the word that speaks out of Eternity; Blown through the ages down with the old hero breath, Fashioning ripe renown, mingled of life and death; Wrapt in the sheeted foam written on keels, that proud Wrestle with thee and roam under the belied cloud! Come, be my playmate yet, carry me in thine arms High above snares that fret bosoms with silken charms; Mix me with thee and make strong as thy stubborn feet, Shadow me round and shake rudely in rapture sweet; Strike with that stinging goad, till I become a part Now of thy rugged road and of thy stormy heart. Wander with thee I must, here on the hoary mount Kindling my faded trust, there at the flashing fount; Thus I renew the springs ebbing in me, and fly Forth upon fairer wings large as thy liberty; Thus out of leaping flood churned by thy path, I gain Life for re-leavened blood, glory of pleasant pain. Then in the yellow land, where the red lichens rest Painted by autumn's hand, gather me to thy breast; Rock me in troubled sleep, pouring about my bed Grace from the Unknown Deep which thy own circuits tread; So that my utter need, drinking thy gusts, may grow Crowned to some loftier deed, feeling thee through me flow. THE MANDATE OF SILENCE. Once in a morning, scarlet as scorning queens with adorning Garments of blood, Out of the prison Night re-arisen Day came in flood; Opened with blushing bosom and flushing cheeks and red rushing Steps of the storm, Gathering round her roses that wound her Wonderful form; Crimson her lightning lips, in the bright'ning glow that was height'ning Grandeur and grace, Misty on mountains, fair in the fountains Clear as God's face. Then from the glory, washing in gory waves, on my hoary Head fell a ray, Laid like a finger, fondly to linger, But not in play. “Thou art anointed, thou art appointed for the disjointed Time,” said a Voice, “Greatly to suffer and in the rougher Stress to rejoice; Speak not to other, own none a brother, friend, or as mother Even or wife; Silence thy carol, peace thy apparel Stemming the strife; Prophets have spoken idly, and broken not one vain token Worshipt as Truth; Thou be the witness, to the unfitness Poisoning youth! Forth from the meaner modes and the leaner lamps unto cleaner Pasturings take Captive, by living upward and giving, All and re-make.” Thus without staying, though but for praying, with no delaying Calmly I came, Into the struggle where the knaves juggle Lightly with fame; When honour dwindles, spent as old spindles, and none rekindles Bravely the fire; Where hushed and hidden, fled and forbidden, Sleeps dim desire. I utter nothing, clad in the clothing of high betrothing Bound to God's Will; But that ray's gesture, with its red vesture, Haloes me still. Out of sin's hollow greedy to swallow more, a few follow Fain to be healed; But I go humbly, and my lips dumbly Ever are sealed. OUR LOST LADY OF HONOUR. The great Queen is past, the good Queen is dead, Cross the pure hands and cover the head; Speak softly and slowly And bend the face lowly, And move about dimly with tears in the tread; For the fair Queen is dead. Lilies and snowdrops for her, and the favour Of roses and violets in one dear savour; Because she was sweet, Because she was fair, With the sunshine her hair And the music her feet. While her words fell as kisses upon our cold lives, And our bustle and clamour, With a blessing and glamour, And drew closer the bonds between husband and wives; O the breath of her mouth was a murmurous song With the dew of the mountains And the joy of the fountains, It fired us with duty and fashioned us strong. But the great Queen has past, The good Queen is dead, And the silence is spread On her glory at last. The great Queen has past, the good Queen is pale As the moonlight that lies on the breast of the vale: She was proud with the beauty That comes as a duty, And shines but on brows bravely fronting the gale; O the good Queen is pale. Crown not of gold for our Lady of honour, Crown of the love that befits the Madonna Who builded us high, And with beautiful girth Joining Heaven to earth Brought Divinity nigh. For she looked on our heroes, and splendid they sprang To the front of the striving, Where the red swords were riving And the steel meeting steel gave a jubilant clang; While the statesman arose, with a vision that saw Down the broadening ages The passionate pages, And struck with his pen the grand sentence of law. But the great Queen has past, The good Queen is pale, And our epical tale Is a sky overcast. The great Queen has past, the good Queen has fled, With the love in her eyes and the glory she shed, Who came at our calling And kept us from falling, If we only would follow where boldly she led; But the fair Queen has fled. Grave not of marble for her but of blessing, Poured from the heart of a people's confessing Who have grown with her great, If they sometimes rebell'd, As her courage upheld Their imperial fate. For she breathed on the prelate, and truly he spoke With the spirit of nations And august inspirations, Till the will of the country was one and awoke; And the churchman stept out with a statelier plan, And discerned the bright border Of a world-shaping order, And entered it feeling new Eden began. But the great Queen has past, The good Queen has fled, And the Empire is sped As with Azrael's blast. The great Queen has past, the good Queen is gone, With the promise that like an eternity shone Round her pathway of plenty, When the one fared as twenty, And still the dead kingdom drags wearily on; Though the fair Queen is gone. For the lip of the maiden has lost its clear carol, And the spot that is nameless defiles her apparel; And the modesty now, That leapt up without shame Like the altar's white flame, Is dethroned from her brow. And the Senate is bought and the leader is sold For the baubles of places, And the doom of disgraces With the might that to-morrow new purchasers hold; And the brand of the huckster has cheapened the shrine With the souls that are bartered And the trafficking chartered, While the priests toy with women and trifle with wine. But the great Queen is past, The good Queen is gone, And in new Babylon Is no mourning or fast. The great Queen has past, the good Queen is cold, Carry her out as clay for the mould, All that was splendour, All that was tender, Not to be paid for by silver and gold; For the fair Queen is cold. But we seek her not now, and we serve her not longer, And our bulwarks are weakness—our arms that struck stronger, When our Mistress was dear As the jewel of life, And religion no strife But magnificent fear. Now the feastings are sordid, the toil has a taint, While our virtue is venal And plain honesty penal, And the sinner leers out from the mask of the saint. Ah, our meetings and doings are matters for hire, And we advertise marriage For the price of a carriage And a coronet trailed in the gutter and mire. But the great Queen has past, The good Queen is cold, And her story is told, Though the world stands aghast. THE MOUNTAIN-TOP VIEW. (A Theophany). Earth was beneath me, And above The blue sky scribbled o'er with clouds; And wanton airs that would enwreath me Blew kisses soft as love, And gossamers wove dewy shrouds. I stood upon the glory of a summit And watched the pageant of the passing life, The eternal strife That flowed from founts more deep than earthly plummet; The mystery of mortal things, The awe and overshadowings. What were the meaning Of despair, That seemed to settle on the globe, And whither the unriddled leaning Of ruin to repair, Wrapt in the ocean's royal robe; I asked who saw each moment gauntly, gaily, Enacted the red murder of the years Like clashing spears, While every creature killed its fellow daily— In hunger for more room and light— And only the brute might seemed right. It looked the panting And delight Of nothing less than Crownèd Death, That broke upon me with the chanting Of doom and sore affright, And sorrow burdened earth's hard breath; Pain in the highest and the lowest revelled, And madness feasted upon Nature's heart In woe apart, And all alike at last was rudely levelled; The red rose maid, the splendid lie, Were simply formed to sin and die. And yet a whisper From forlorn Recesses and their half sealed book, With every blade a separate lisper, Gave me a larger look And lifted me to views unborn; I marked, or thought I marked, beneath the wrangling And bitter contest of the ceaseless wrath A secret path Away from horrors of the dumb dread strangling, Done in that silent nameless woe, Where each thing was the other's foe. I saw a glimmer, Then a gleam, Which brightened to the perfect glow And broadened through the spaces dimmer To something more than dream, Till sight was light above, below; I found the evil and the troubled tossings Were but the desperate struggle to be free And climb to Thee, O Father, if by crimes and awful crossings; A needful passage of the flood, That only purged through fire and blood. I knew the losing, And the fangs Corroding breasts like rust, Would be (if asked) each mortal's choosing With all their precious pangs, For hearts firm-rooted in pure trust; And but in flames of everlasting burnings, The upward trial without stint or end And death made friend, Could we attain the height of fullest learnings— Redeemed by tears and iron rod— And man himself be truly God. And there was pity And its power Deep in the writhings of dark clay, Down in the murmur of the city, Self-tortured into flower And feeling after the noonday; Yea, love amid the sadness and the surging Prevailed, though masked, with solemn miracle Ineffable, And gathered beauty from the scorn and scourging; For under penance of the earth and sky, Throbbed out a sweet Necessity. And the grim slaughter Loud or mute In wide creation, like a sword Wreaking its lust on land and water, Was but the Master's lute Who touched at times a broken chord; The fear that stifled, and the staring anguish In storms world-shaking and the tiny twinge, Were but the fringe Of that ascent by which to God we languish; And yet each teardrop fitted in, The glorious suffering and the sin. No longer puzzled, I beheld That dawning beam of destined scope, Though hell itself seemed oft unmuzzled With fury that rebelled But yielded to the larger hope; And we who fought against our lot in blindness Or tottered faintly from the reeling rank And sullen sank, Yet drew in every breath the inner kindness; The voice that cursed the fated strife, Drank of its fulness very life. And thus though stricken Breast and brow, And feebly clinging to my post, While ordeals round me threatening thicken, I read the enigma now Exulting when I sorrow most; Thence only, not from cloister or by college, Comes the serener philosophic sight And orbed light, From clustering rays of all our broken knowledge; I am content to be, a part Of that which is God's bleeding Heart. THE CIRCLE OF LIFE. My heart and I— We were resolved to conquer earth, To meet its hate and direr mirth And heart of stone, unarmed, alone— If we should die— Yet build of thought a lasting throne Claspt by no vulgar golden girth, Right in the Temple of the Gods Above the passing periods— The place of thunder, Where wisdom with its fateful dower Is more than peace and more than power, And riddling life is rent asunder. My heart and I, We were resolved to do or die. My heart and I— We sought the Cities of the Plain Re-risen and brighter from the slain, And saw the years like ripened ears— But did not die— Go with their splendid faiths and fears, To lighten other lands again; We battled with the burdening flesh, And fainting still stood up afresh Upon the mountain Of refuge in its iron arms, The stronger from the cheated charms, And drinking of the muddied fountain. My heart and I Saw visions dark, and did not die. My heart and I— We hungered yet and journeyed on And reached the mighty Babylon, With turrets tall and ripe for fall— But did not die— And read the writing on the wall, Uplifted with a doom foregone; We feasted like the revellers, And watched with grey astrologers The starry pages, When on the mapt-out midnight sky They tasted of Eternity, And tracked the orbit of the ages. My heart and I Read awful truths, and did not die. My heart and I— We went to Egypt in the morn Of history to get us corn, And at her gates like frozen fates— But did not die— We marked a hundred vassal States, That filled her flowing cup of scorn; The grave that locks in silent lids, The secret of the Pyramids; The mystic teacher That takes no lessons out of time, In that stone pulpit above crime, And is a text for every preacher. My heart and I, Enigmas too, yet did not die. My heart and I— We came to Athens in the sweet Of moonlight, and at her fair feet Sat gently down beneath her crown— But did not die— And talked of learning and renown, The forms of things, in vision fleet Which ranged through Space and under skies Of blue, with young philosophies; The violet's bosom Gave out its heart, the fancy shone, And all the pillared Parthenon Burst in a glory of white blossom. My heart and I Sat dreaming there, and did not die. My heart and I— We found a lodging place in Rome, A world, but no sufficient home Amid her throng and regal wrong— But did not die— And buildings fair as carven song, Which bare up heaven upon their dome; We faced her wrath like ramping fire, The crowned sin, the scarlet tire; From marble letters We reaped no rest, with higher hopes That laughed at earthly horoscopes— The proudest piles were only fetters. My heart and I Endured the death, and did not die. My heart and I— We journeyed on, we travelled west And suckled at the bloody breast Without a name, with rites of shame— But did not die— And never touched the Fount of Fame, In superstition black, unblest; We noted but the accursed might, And dreadful knowledge with no light; The radiant revels, Tremendous fanes, and crowded courts Which storm-tost minds deemed pleasant ports, Were but the glorious freaks of devils. My heart and I Escaped their tomb, and did not die. My heart and I— We saw the triumph of the Cross, And in the new world's omphalos Another bliss by Tamesis— But did not die— With man reborn, but made amiss As by a science Setebos; Gigantic shows, a nightmare shade, God wooed as partner in the trade— A decent cover To veil the fraud and monstrous vice, And souls an easy sacrifice To Fashion and the richest lover. My heart and I Long sickened there, and did not die. My heart and I— We humbly turned upon our track With empty arms and voyaged back, By sea and shore and city store— But did not die— And swore we would not wander more, When all the harvest proved but lack; Low burned the candle now of life, Betwixt its curtain and the strife; The little cottage Still welcomed us with outstretched hands, And love not found in storied lands With holy kiss and mess of pottage. My heart and I Had weathered worlds, and did not die. My heart and I— We found the temple of the Gods, Unsentinelled by sacred rods, Or bolts and bars and cruel Mars— But did not die— Among the lesser earthly stars, The heaven where hourly labour plods; It rose beneath the foot of trust, And columned sprang from splendid dust; But red from slaughter Or rank with lying breath of men, Fame entered not our lowly ken And everywhere was writ in water. My heart and I Abode in Truth, and did not die. GENIUS IS WAITING. I have waited for the morning and its finger white Jewelled, with the last adorning free and infinite; Laid above my work of love and the long affliction, Kindling all the heavy pall with its benediction; Through the night ofevery ill I have walked with weary gait, Seeking for the goal, and still I can wait. I have waited—this is spoiling darkness of its fate, And to be with God's own toiling consubstantiate; This is life in empty strife conquering the winner, Working on when hope is gone as a new beginner; With the shadows grimly set round me like a prison strait, I have bravely fought, and yet I will wait. THE SORROW OF IT. It's O that there should ever be This weary sound on earth and sea, Which is the old world's leaven; And through wide Nature's troubled brain Should throb the master pulse of pain, Which thrills the path to Heaven; As if the labouring land and sky, Finding no utterance but a cry, Were some poor soul unshriven And sought but nowhere heard reply Save its own echoed agony, Or would not be forgiven. And yet it's well, the perfect note In singing voice, and hand that wrote Was always one sweet sadness; Which in each mortal thing held part, And is the beating burning heart Alike in mirth and madness; That thus by steps of holy grief Man might attain a fairer fief Than in the gift of gladness, And life however poor and brief Rise to its due divine relief Purged from the dross and badness. It's O that in the bosom's throe Should be the accent of the woe Which murmurs throughout Nature, And on the morning's brow will weave The prophecy of coming eve To cloud its present stature; And struggle far and near for light Dim yearnings that still vainly fight With their dark judicature; And high and low the idle wings Of youth, with fond imaginings Disown their legislature. And yet it's well, the onward track Should lay a burden on the back It broadens as it presses, And anguish mingles with the cup We drink who yet are climbing up If but with awful guesses; And wails that long and lonely call, Through every speech and space and all That moves in mortal dresses For though the trouble must be sure, It is its own exceeding cure And with the blow it blesses. Its O that everywhere the strain, Like mourning, is dyed in the grain And texture of creation; While suffering helpless throws a sigh To Heaven which cannot stoop more nigh, And asks a deaf salvation; That guiding Powers (if such) are dumb To human care though cold and numb Beneath the slow damnation, Or lift us playthings up and tools With systemed pangs through solemn schools By ghastly education! And yet it's well, it's very well Hope should not be remote from hell Nor Judas from the eleven; For pain must be the altar knife, In mercy held, by which our life Is still renewed when riven. And souls that from their summits fell In shadow for a while to dwell, By shame are higher driven; While sorrow is our Matin bell And then at evensong doth swell, To ring us home to Heaven. NEPENTHE. I sit among the flowers at fancy's loom, And fashion day and night In visions of delight; To weave the glow of sunrise and the gloom At midnight with the withered leaves and bloom, For one great glamoured sight. I see the shadows pass upon the pictured grass, And in the streams reflected dreams As from a magic glass; They are more near and dimly dear Than noontide's garish gleams. And though men wonder why, I make new earth and sky, and toil exceedingly. For I have drunk the gods' nepenthe deep, And look beyond the stars Or these poor human bars, Into the soft eternities of sleep; Below me mortals blindly crawl and creep, And gather scorn and scars. I know the inmost act is fiction and not fact, And carven clay receives no ray Until the bowl is crackt; The thought is thing, and carries Spring Of everlasting day. And though men wonder how, with sad and sicklied brow I keep my sacred vow. I catch the moment on its wing of grace And pluck its soul of joy, As from a jewelled toy, Out of the rapture of its fleeting trace; Till flesh and bone with burning fires embrace, Which blast yet not destroy. The dew and dawn that fly are the reality, In outward shapes the trick escapes Which is Infinity; Time hath no part within that heart, Which matter darkly drapes. And though men wonder much, my destiny is such and owns a higher touch. I sit at fancy's web among the flowers, And fashion sun and moon Into a fairer noon; And of the purple shades and pearly showers I build in crystal steps white temple towers, A wonder and a boon. They see the ragged ends but not the Form, that bends My purpose bond to heights beyond And ever upward tends; I plan and ply the tapestry, Nor could in death despond. And though men mark one side—the roughness, not the pride—its glory is my guide. WHAT IS THE VISION? Seer, what is the Vision? Seer, what saith the Night, Which on me derision pours, but is thy light? In those dreadful spaces where thy spirit walks White, through native places, and with spirit talks; How, when awful being is the same as seeing, Can this carnal mind Steeped in common clay by its earthly way Rest and refuge find? Clogged with spume and spatter but of sordid matter Daily still more dense, How can I adventure high Dungeoned in the sense? Seer, what is the Vision In thy land of light, Which, to me derision, Opens not its larger lot? Seer, what saith the Night? Seer, what is the reading of our riddle old? Whither is it leading man to fate untold? Far above the struggles which to us are death, And a joy that juggles with deceiving breath; Thou, where act and thinking in one solemn linking Marry ere they meet, Dost securely go past the ebb and flow Fair with travelled feet. I, in this dull prison chained and unarisen, Wonder at thy flight Up beyond my lowly bond And congenial night. Seer, what is the reading Of the riddling years? Whither are they leading Men who rust in kindred dust, Through our dazzling fears? THE LARK. Incarnate song, thou wingèd flame, Up in the unbounded sky Which scarce can hold thy bursting frame, Embodied ecstasy! As in the ocean's blue water Thou sailest on, sweet voyager, Into eternity; Yet bring us back the notes of heaven, To be for earth the living leaven Which only can refine, And every clod with breath of God Will glow and be Divine. Dear traveller, thy foot is free And walketh on the wind By paths thine eye alone can see, Which leave no track behind; As though the sunshine of all space Were, with its joy, in the embrace Of thy small breast confin'd. Sing on and in our hearts, and ever With thy ascension hymn endeavour To charm away our fears; Till, lifted thus, we take with us Thy music through the years. LIFE AND DEATH. Into the hidden world I came, Where human footsteps may not pass; I saw the secret of the flame, And heard the growing of the grass. I studied at the root of things The fountains and the fashionings, Beyond this vision mortal; I marked each process working by, The magic and the mystery, And oped the silent portal. But at the bases of the years, I found the well-spring was of tears. In solemn chambers dim and deep I tracked the wonder of all life, And learned the treasure stored by sleep Ere flowering into fruitful strife; How song birds get their summer tune, And roses steal the love of June To turn it into glory; And why the modest daisies blush, Or rhythmic passion has a hush Even in the heart's mid story. But, under tempest and the toy, I found the inmost note was joy. I drew the dazzling veil aside Which curtained Nature's region round, I watched the grave's dark gates divide And pushed for ever back its bound. But as my search went farther on Another light through shadow shone, And blest my daring travel; The mighty wheels that move the globe And murmur in its rustling robe, Had nothing now to ravel. For sorrow seemed in gladness done, And life and death were only one. AT TIMES. At times, The morning and the noon And in the magic of the moon, Sweet thoughts from far like old remembered chimes Return to me, and all my spirit flowers Into the bliss of unforgotten bowers; I hear The mystic murmur of the song Which sends the rolling world along, In ectasy of dumb delicious fear; And as the great walls rock and sunder, I learn the secret of the thunder. I see Through this dull prison clay Which clouds and bars the better way, And as the will awakes the life is free; For at the flutter of my captive pinions, Space opens wide to me its grand dominions. And when In drowsy moods of pleasant dream I see the distant porches gleam, It is the visit of my native ken; I feel my wings that would be flying From earth's brute discord and denying. O yes, I whisper in thine ear, True friend, and not without a tear, Even I have seen God's naked loveliness; And He, when I with doubts am ridden, Hath shown to me the fane forbidden. His love Doth wrap me most divinely round And tuck me in with tender sound, And clothe me warmly as a bloom's white glove. It is as near as red to roses, And on my heart like dew reposes. When ill Of wrong or danger falls, And siren music to me calls, He is the same and cometh closer still; Betwixt me and the dear temptation, He sets His richer revelation. He spares No joy by which the spirit lives, And like a gentlest Mother gives To me the Bosom which He freely bares. And, drawing from those blessed fountains, I stand with Him on virgin mountains. THE NEW WORLD. Yes, they told me I was steering, as the angry wind went veering, On a rude and rocky shore With the breakers on my lee; And old mariners, whose faces had found grim and rugged graces In the waves and wondrous lore, Long had counselled I must flee. They had washed them in the ocean's brine, and felt the maddest motions Of the tempest in its track, when it scattered wrath and wrack; They were salted souls and true, and had learned the water's clue, But the boldest of them shuddered as I shook out reefs, unruddered, And to shelter turned my back— For the death or glory's due. But I stayed not, and the thralling of a sure and secret calling Drew me coldly, blithely on To the triumph or the doom. And the warning was not needed, and the wishes fell unheeded, Though no sunshine ever shone Through the thwart and solid gloom. For I heard the mystic voices and despised the meaner choices Which put safety before light and the knowledge that is might; And I saw no portal yet in the perils that beset, As I took the crested billow at its flood and gained a pillow Which was balm unto my flight— And the pain I did forget. With a music as of thunder, lo, I ploughed the surf asunder, Lifted gladly with the tide As a king upon a throne; And the scudding spray beat yellow on my brow, and with a bellow Leapt the breaker in its pride, Like a beast with baffled tone. But I reached the glorious haven, and beneath me like a paven Road the surges for me spread drift of dying things and dead, While their enmity was aid and about me kindly laid; I seemed coming to a splendid feast by every power attended, Earth was brighter for my tread With its blossoms' tangled braid. But the ship that bravely carried me, and was so sorely harried By the buffets of the storm, Now was conquered at the last; And it lay in fragments broken, a poor silent toy and token Of the grand imperial form, And a bye-word of the blast. It had done the simple duty when it bore me in its beauty To the harbour I would seek, and then sank down spent and meek, With the service and the joy that no ruin could destroy; Part was tumbled with the shingle, part was glad in peace to mingle With the muddy ooze and reek— But in God for God's employ. Ah, I found the kingdom sodden with my blood was soil untrodden And a virgin land and sweet Rich with every valued spoil; And its fields unmapt, unbounded, with familiar strains resounded In a welcome new and meet, And it fruited without toil. Never yet had gallant mortal passed the dim and dreadsome portal Which concealed such dainty store, silver song and golden ore And the royal pearls and gems fit for bridal vesture hems; I had won the treasure hidden by the ages and forbidden, Just because I loved it more— Truth, not empty diadems. But the harvest and the winning were my end, though the beginning Of a better time for man, And his cradle was my grave; For its ploughing thus divided what had else the years derided, And the sowing if a span Was the life my body gave. And the thoughts that cannot perish which the nations dearly cherish, I did offer as the price beyond rubies and rare spice; And they burst the sealèd door, and left the abyss a floor Where enfranchised peoples gaily take their will and pastime daily, On the unknown sacrifice— And no lot is longer poor. THE SPIRIT OF THE MOOR. O it was not in the morning that my darling came to me, In her young and shy adorning that was wonderful to see; And it was not in the noonlight, or the madness of the moonlight With its sad and silver flame— But she came. She looked earthly but not human And so full of pretty ways, Like a mingling of wild roses and the honeysuckle's poses With invisible warm rays; Speaking gently to the true man, Of the vanished elder days. Still the drowsy land lay sleeping in the kisses of the sun, And a fairy form was peeping from a foxglove, as a nun Out of her coy lattice curtain pries with timid brow uncertain, To behold what she should shun; When with wisping and a lisping, As if all the leaves were crisping And in love and laughter some, She did come. She was clothed in purple shadow and the gossamer and dew, And the glory of the meadow in its fragrance fresh and new, When the buttercup is yellow and the celandine its fellow, And the daisy like a star Shines afar. She had something of the Dryad With loose amber-coloured hair, And in one hand was a thistle's ruddy blossom with its bristles, Like a sceptre's solemn air; She had something of the Naiad, And her mocking face was fair. From an oak I thought she started, as I sat and lightly dreamed, And the space before me parted when upon my youth she gleamed, While her bosom heaved as panting and her eyes of all enchanting With unriddled beauties beamed. In a gliding and a sliding Fashion as if from me hiding, Moved the murmur of her feet Bare and sweet. O the rapture of the vision conquered me at once, and fell In a touch of fond derision on my spirit with a spell; All the life within me rallied as she looked at me and dallied With my passion as a glove, Into love. And the scent of her soft vesture Had the richness, that the soil Grants the worker with his harrow when it pays its meat and marrow To his care and kindly toil; And round me, with many a gesture, Did she weave a magic coil. For she waxed more bright, and nearer drew those pure and perfumed charms, Growing whiter, warmer, clearer, and without a hint of harms; And the doubt that might have shielded me turned into trust and yielded, Till I melted in her arms. And her glances woke the dances Of old dear and dead romances, In the tumult of my heart— Worlds apart. And what passed then no confession could disburden if I tried; In the truth of that transgression, I was crowned and crucified. For between us yet the thistle's head thrust out its armèd bristles, As denying what she gave Like the grave. And to me those heather billows Now no longer may be poor, For they found me subtle traces and they showed departed graces While they still unlock a door; And hot breasts that are my pillows, Tell the secrets of the Moor. And we often mix, and higher grow our natures, and each morn Sees my gladness lifted higher as to better solace born; But in spite of many a meeting, after each last farewell greeting She bequeaths me just a thorn. And though flowers build me bowers, As all treasures lend their dowers, There abides of every sheaf One sere leaf. SECTION III. Kingdom of the Cross. ASCRIPTION. O immutable And inscrutable Awful Deity, Thou adorable Unexplorable Spontaneity! In the treasure full, In the measure full Of Thy latitude. Touch my littleness, Heal my brittleness And ingratitude. From Divinity's Fair infinities, Though by loss-bearing, Raise my needingness To the exceedingness Of Thy cross-bearing. O Thou Beautiful, Make me dutiful— All that ails in me; With Thy fashioning Wrought by passioning, Drive Thy nails in me. INVOCATION. Speak to me, Holy One, speaking in love, Come to me, Lowly One, come from above, Down to my weaknesses, down to my sin; Mould me with meeknesses, new-made within. Lift me and leaven me righteous and pure, Lift to Thy Heaven me cleansed and secure; Breathe as the wind on me, breath on my face Airs as of Ind on me, odorous grace. Burn as the fire in me, burn up the dross, Kindle desire in me true to the Cross; Flow as the ocean full, strong as Thou art, Fill with devotion full sweetly my heart. Through little lips of mine, stammering, weak, Purged from eclipse of mine, mightily speak; Quicken the blindnesses, scatter the haze, With Thy clear kindnesses open my gaze. Dim is my hearkening, deaf with the choice Of this world's darkening, waiting Thy voice. Crown my unmeetnesses with Thy own might, With Thy completenesses perfect my sight. Show me myself, O God, brighten the book Of that dark shelf, O God, every dark nook; Unveil Thy Being, Lord, dearer than day, Better than seeing, Lord, light'ning the way; Bear me, through billowing waters that toss, Safe to Thy pillowing, Home to the Cross. Cover this nakedness (as the wide globe) With new awakedness under Thy robe, Fitting most feelingly to each dark stain As I go reelingly bowed with my pain. Form of Thy witnesses me to endure Sealed with the fitnesses Thou dost assure, Stript of all vanities weighing me down For Thy humanity's clothing and crown— Garments of glorious uses and art Proved and victorious mail for my heart. Deal with me tenderly, armour my life Feeble and slenderly fashioned for strife, Fence it with graciousness flowing from Thee Out of Thy spaciousness wonderful, free; Safe from the rancour and evil and dross, Build me and anchor and nail to the Cross. THE CRIMSON CROSS. “The Cross leads generations on.”— Shelley. I saw a Crimson Cross set on a bitter hill, The red sun hid his face, the troubled earth stood still, While all the powers of hell worked out their wicked will. Upon it hung a Form, with hands upraised to bless The murderous foes whose sins He suffered to redress, In crowned and conquering woe an awful Loveliness. And from each pleading wound that opened scarlet lips The great drops trickled down on spearheads' iron tips, And all but that dear Face was robed in dread eclipse. But round the Cross there rolled a ghastly shadowed shine, That showed the features yet and every tortured line Bathed in the Love that filled those Human eyes Divine. The darkness like a sea washed on with stifling waves Against it, and behold! from rended rocky caves, Upstarted all the sheeted dead in dusty graves. And out of every tomb and dim unquiet deep, The buried things of ages left their haunted sleep, And came as ghostly shapes around the Cross to weep. A fearful silence gathered up the world, and slid Upon each waiting heart, like death itself, and hid And hushed the stormy beats as with a coffin lid. The very birds were dumb and frozen in mid song Beneath the crushing pall of that gigantic wrong, Which with consenting Heaven and earth grew fresh and strong. A horror crept from brow to brow in cursèd might, With muttered oaths and agony of bane and blight, And in the aching breast was shadow more than night. But there that patient Figure in the blasting ray Which fell on Him alone as with a dawnèd day, Still stood with outstretched hands that seemed to watch and pray. And from His withered Face and from His wounded side Compassion writ with blood welled in a saving tide, Around His foes and slayers in their palaced pride. And then, as He in lone unutterable shame Hung on the Crimson Cross with spent and bleeding frame, A solitary Bird to Him with succour came. Though it could do but little and in strength was weak, And had no helping arm nor word of hope to speak, It brought a drop of dew within its tiny beak. It touched the fevered lips that were so white and worn, And for a moment cooled the forehead pierced and torn, But tried and tried in vain to break one cruel thorn. And on the panting bosom one red drop was shed That fell in benediction from that holy Head, And would have quickened dust that lay for centuries dead. But now the Blessèd Bird for ever wears the mark As witness to the Truth in every region dark, And flashes through all time its clear and crimson spark. And, lo, when that sweet act of tender aid was done Which made the earth and Heaven and man and Nature one, God smiled in unveiled love upon His dying Son. And on the quaking rocks and to the curtained sky Rang out in solemn stillness one great Conqueror's cry, Which opened up a door into eternity. But, when I looked again, the Sacred Form was gone And through the shadow of a Cross the sunlight shone, While the world's groaning wheels went grinding dimly on. And, ah, a thin red streak which nothing now could stay Rose from the awful ground which hallowed ever lay, And through all years and tears pursued its precious way. Forth ran that weary dread dicomfortable Path And over it the sky stooped in one cloud of wrath, For bitter was the fruit though rich the aftermath. It started from the Cross, as in the veinèd flesh With every nerve that throbs throughout that living mesh A ruddy gash is cut and staunched and bleeds afresh. At first the Path of Pain seemed faltering and faint, And though it travelled on unturned by evil's taint Yet it was paved with bones of many a martyred saint. O maidens bright and pure were pilgrims on the track, And when the boding air with death and doom was black They still went humbly forth and never one looked back. But oft they gave their gentle bodies to the foe And suffered nameless wrong, and as with earthquake throe, Exhaled sweet lives as flowers upon that way of woe. A tide of troubled figures as in tossing waves, The old and young and queens and kings and crownèd slaves Rolled down that dreary road and only left their graves. It gathered everywhere recruits from all the climes, And filled the broken ranks with soldiers from new times, While in their happy ears rang blessèd Christmas chimes. And as one pilgrim fell yet others in his place Stept without stay or fear and broadened out the space, And radiant was the Cross writ on each upturned face. The sinking handed on his message to the next, His shield of faith and sword, his tomb became a text Of comfort to the weak and hope to hearts perplext. They ate the bread of sorrow, drank the cup of tears And spread their table in a wilderness of fears, But more and mightier grew with hate and hostile years. They followed no false god of dazzling dream or wraith But harkened only to the Word the Scripture saith, And were content with wounds if in the fight of faith. And wider waxed the road, and brighter burnt the fire, Which flashed from altars white and calm to Heaven a spire Of beaconing beauty and an infinite desire. For hoary-headed men and tottering children came, And with their ministering blood they fed the flame Which looked more glorious even beneath the shade of shame. But higher rose the Path and clearer was it spread, No more a doubtful track or tiny crimson thread, It ran and shone betwixt the dying and the dead. And as it moved it purged the gold from dusky dross, It gleaned fair jewels out of empty waste and loss, And every milestone in it was a Crimson Cross. But as I gazed, behold, the bitter pain was joy, The thorns and flints were roses that could never cloy, And martyrdom was gain and earth an idle toy. The robe of torture was a glad angelic dress, The cutting sword a kiss, the rack but God's caress, And killing scathe of scorn a crown of righteousness. The ugly angry clouds like Azrael's wings took flight, And all that seemed most wrong became Divinely right, The grave a portal opening into Peace and Light. I saw throughout the lands and blazoned on the sky That holy Crimson Cross, when suns and moons went by, Unto the end of time, from all eternity. It was the pledge and seal of everlasting Love, In hecatombs of men and in the murdered dove, In great and small a witness to the God above. I marked it sculptured in the trees, and in the frame Of universal Nature stamped in stone the same, And painted on the clouds and unconsumed in flame. For none could raise the house to be his mortal home, And none could bathe in blue the temple's climbing dome, Unless he signed the Cross read in the Blessèd Tome. And none could set his hand to pleasure or to toil, Or build the living book or pluck from fields their spoil, Without the shadow of the Cross on page and soil. For all the earth with all the splendour and the spice, Was purchased with the Blood and at tremendous price, And founded on the Cross of solemn sacrifice. Ah, no two hands could join without the sacred sign, And no two hearts be one without its pain benign, And none without the Cross escape the world malign. It was the latest word—the Cross—it was the first, And yielding to its law alone could quench our thirst, Or make the fountains from the stony desert burst. It was the final form below all other shapes, The thought beneath the thorn, the acid in the grapes, The Cross behind the harbour stood on stormy capes. The monarch who would rule was sceptred with its power, The Cross gave drudges tools and wisdom's grandest dower— Beyond the farthest dreams and in the fairest bower. And evermore the Way rose upward and went on, Though systems fell with countless generations gone, And broader, brighter, still in dreadful beauty shone. And shouting multitudes that daily grew more strong With shield of golden prayer and sword of silver song, Now like a mighty sea in flood rolled free along. The dirge of black defeat was changed to triumph tones, The graves of martyrs clothed with thunder became thrones, And weary stumbling blocks had turned to stepping stones. The lurid glare of tempest vanished with the gloom, And all the sad and sullen atmosphere of doom Leapt out with laughter and broke into rosy bloom. The blast of battle ceased, the bloody flags were furl'd, Sweet children's voices round the rusty cannon purl'd And played through every iron tideway of the world. And mounted yet the Path beyond each fear and frown, While from its track fell rain of richest mercies down, Till lost in light the Cross of Glory looked a Crown. THE SIGN. Under crimson skies of sunset did the little child go forth, But his sorrow with him went And a holy discontent, And he turned his glances southward and he looked into the north; For the royal sun was dying Like a hero in a battle-field and on a gory bed, And a restless wind was crying Like a sin that cannot slumber though with darkness on it shed; And his eyes were full of visions and his heart was big with prayer While he sought some other toy, That would be a lasting joy And defeat the coming shadow and the curse of Time the Slayer. O he dwelt upon the east and ranged abroad throughout the west, With a weariness of soul That thus early took its toll, In the waking of the windows and the budding of the breast; For the day had left him nothing, Though it gave him only blisses of its blossom and its dew; And a surfeit as of lothing Now possest him, as he sadly asked for pleasure yet anew; Till his baby hands discovered all but one thing was a loss, And it sank into his life With its emptiness and strife, When he read on the horizon as in fire the sacred Cross. It was written on his forehead and engraven on his hand, But the sunset on him lay From the breaking of the day, And it breathed a mask of mourning for the brightness of the land; While he asked of all a token That would lead him on his journey and might be a certain sign, Just a word of helping spoken Or a miracle of promise where the portents seemed malign; And around him every beacon looked misguiding as he moved, Like a traveller whose gaze Cannot pierce the closing haze, And goes doubtfully and dimly forth by stages still unproved. It was sculptured in his bosom and was mingled with his blood, And the iron entered far; It eclipsed the very star, And lay under the foundations and kept purging with the flood; But he could not read the writing, While he bent so low and earthward and found treasures in the dust; Till he felt a true delighting, In the beauty of affliction and the blindnesses of trust; And he saw it then behind the flower and then beneath the gloss Of the purple and the pride, As a comrade at his side, And he found the key of mysteries was in the sacred Cross. There was light upon the meadow and a glory girt the mount, But a burden on her prest As a serpent at the breast, Though she gathered gold of buttercups and drank the silver fount; And not sweet to her the manna Of the wilderness that fell around and gave her daily food, For she needed yet a banner That would shine before the shadowed way and cheer her every mood; And she sought it in the breezes of each passing hope or whim, She pursued it too in gain, And inquired for it in vain Of the cup of nectared happiness that overflowed its brim. But the thorn was in her paradise, the thistle at her feet, And the cruel pavement stones Where the sorrows sat on thrones, Told the same thing in the murmur of the brazen-throated street; And with clear prophetic waving The one flag it flew before her on the cloud-land and the wind, And in readiness of saving It encompassed like an atmosphere and followed her behind; Till at last she read the message of the cedar and the moss, In the greatest and the least, At the funeral and feast, And was bathed through all her being gladly in the sacred Cross. They were few and they were lowly and yet beautiful and free, Though a curtain as if cut Out of ebony had shut All the avenues around them and left portal none to see; So they asked but for a rifting In the weary walls of darkness and a glimpse of guiding blue, With a reverent uplifting Of the hands that craved the Fatherhood and could not find a clue; O they bowed upon the threshold of the awful and unknown With the sacrifice of tears, And dim services of fears, While their idols now were shattered and the altars overthrown. On their knees they begged for mercy and epiphany of might That would strengthen them for toil, And wash off the sinful soil With the cleansing of compassion, and awake the inward light. But there came no voice of pity From the silence of the cloister and the secret of the shrine Or the madness of the City, Though they felt the God was near them and they were themselves Divine; Till a door within them opened and behind the veil of dross, They beheld the seal of Truth, Which bestows on worlds their youth, And the heavenward-pointing finger of the sad and sacred Cross. Lo, he leant across the centuries with pale prophetic glance, In his passion for some thought Upon fiery anvils wrought, Which would solve the endless riddle of dear life and its romance; A fit watchword for wise telling, And a battle-cry to weld the nations on a common ground After idle sentinelling Of the seekers and the sages, one which all could rally round; And he wanted just a lightning line or thundering phrase of flame, Which might marry to the real The impossible ideal, And unite the gray philosophies and future in one name. But none answered him, no signal flashed athwart the sullen sky But his own reflected part, And the beating of his heart Was the only echo wafted from the dumb eternity; And he read his lifetime's pages In the wrinkled mist that crept beneath the summit where he stood, And a curse upon the stages Of his brother and above the glory of bright woman-hood; Till he saw on humble Calvaries where billows tear and toss, And embraced within his soul As his guidance and control, The red beauty of the nails and kissing of the sacred Cross. THE CROSS. The Measure of Love. There is no measure like the Cross, There is no measure so, Which is as infinite in loss And as exceeding low; It probes into the poisonous leaven Of evil's awful spell, It is as high as highest Heaven, It is as deep as hell. Ah, if I were Almighty God Who suffered sore for us, And He the crawling worm I trod, I would not measure thus. There is no measure like the rule Which meted God our dearth, And carries all the joys of Yule Like sunshine round the earth; Bought for us at tremendous price And daily, hourly pangs, In that perpetual Sacrifice Where God the Victim hangs; For O not once or twice alone In agony He died, He ever reigns upon that Throne For us the Crucified. There is no measure like that tree Of dreadful living death, Upraised for sinners whereon He For us draws dying breath; And every soul that passes by His mercy signs His doom, And every spot is Calvary Where Jesus finds no room. But if I were Almighty God, And He the midge below A moment playing o'er the sod, I would not measure so. There is no measure like the span Of God's most boundless Love, Which took the squalid home in man And gave him all above; That chose the littleness and debt And dolorous bounds of sin, And purged that prison floor and set Eternity within; And though a thousand times cast out A thousand times He yearns For us, despite the hate and doubt, And to His shame returns. There is no measure like that prayer For these dim rebel lands, Which still for ill and God's own slayer Uplifts the nailèd hands; It bears all cruelty and scorn To wipe away one tear, It wears for crime the crownèd thorn And leans upon the spear. But if I were Almighty God And He my bitterest foe, Condemned but to the judgment rod, I would not measure so. There is no measure like that Heart Of the Most Holy One, Which bled so for the wicked part Which only we had done; Which bleeds for ever, as we drive The wounds of torture deep, With direr woes He came to shrive, And sorrow He must keep; That things of darkness and the dust, As bubbles on the tide, May find a refuge they can trust Safe in His riven side. There is no measure like the Cross Which reaches through all time, To purge the golden ore from dross, And gathers of each clime; There is no measure like the Love Of the Thrice-Blessèd Lord, Who plants us on His seat above While smitten by our sword. Ah, if I were Almighty God And He with murderer's blow Struck at me from earth's puny clod, I would not measure so. THE CROSS. The Measure of Sin. When the name that is known not in Heaven was heard And the eyes of the angels grew dim, While the River of Life in its fountain was stirred Till the waters washed over their brim; When the word that is nameless, The word that is woe For a season of night entered in; When the thing that is shameless And every one's foe Threw a shadow on all and was Sin; Then the breast of the Father was torn with a throe, As He felt the downfallen akin. Ah, the evil and erring was yet His own child And begotten in beauty and joy, Upon whom at His birth He had tenderly smil'd And endowed with the earth as a toy; But the root that is bitter, The root that is bane Now laid hold of humanity's heart, And the glamour and glitter Were turned into pain And the pleasure no less had a smart; But in all of the curse, with its sorrow and chain, God Himself had a terrible part. It was not that His playmate, His darling, His pride And the crown of the blossoming years, Now was blighted and wandered away from His side And sought fellowship rather with tears; But the wrong that is cruel, The wrong that is grief Had come home to the Father who gave, And the bliss in His jewel Was troubled and brief, And between them lay death and the grave; Though He knew what alone could redeem with relief, And the hope that was mighty to save. Ah, the will of his creature so righteously plann'd, And enriched with the exquisite flower Of all possible tributes of sea and the land, Was now set against Him and His dower; And the cup that is broken, The cup that is spilt Had been chosen by man for his aid, And the deed with its token Of darkness and guilt Fell in blight on foundations He laid; And the temple to rise must in blood be rebuilt, When the sentence of mercy was said. For the sin in its infinite compass cried out For a Sacrifice that was no less, When from earth in its bonds came the conquering shout Of the wrong still defying redress; And the light that is error, The light that is dark, Had dethroned the bright truth of the day, And the shadow of terror Had curtained the Ark, And the leaders were farthest astray; But they looked not above for the beaconing mark, And they looked not below at the way. So the counsels that are of Eternity bade That the Highest must meekliest lie, And the Blessèd who lived in the children He made Must alone for their trespasses die; And the One who is Holy, The One who is kin To all beauty must bear all the loss, And be reckoned most lowly And Himself become Sin, That His children be purged from their dross; But, behold, when He knocked they would scarce let Him in, And then gave Him as Kingdom the Cross. ONE STEP OUT OF SELF INTO CHRIST. “And immediately the ship was at the land, whither they went.”—John vi. 21. The Lord came to me in the middle night In light, Although I saw and served Him ill, and spake “Awake! Gird up thy loins and take thy pilgrim lamp, For damp And dark the journey is, and yet not long With song; But likewise hold thy staff, and fill with praise And raise Thy heart to Me and never once look back, Though black And endless seem the chill and rugged road Or load.” Then I arose and trimmed my lamp and went Content With Him, and lightly left with praise and staff The chaff And husks and evil pleasures of the earth, That dearth And want became at length and crying woe; But, lo, The first wave of my voyage was the last, And cast My weakness on my Saviour and my Friend— The End. “WHERE IS HE?” A Christophany. “Where is He?” So I questioned who would be His slave, and silence answered, “Where is He?” I was no priest or prophet and no king With iron sceptre, but a wanderling Astray upon the mountains of the night, And vainly groping for a ray of light— Somehow and somewhere in the curtained cloud, Which was at once my shelter and my shroud— Without one human grace or humble gift, And seeking just a glimmer or blue rift For the dark earth that mocked my stumbling tread, In those great heavens of gray, dumb overhead. I had no knowledge but a child-like love, That simply prayed and stretched dim hands above, Against the veil that blurred God's miracle, To the Unknown and the Unknowable; I had no treasure, but a little trust Which trembled upward like a flame, from dust And masquerades of mist and the deep dense Phantasmagoria of fallacious sense, As to its native skies; I had no guide, But my own shadow walking at my side; I had no hope, that might a moment save, But the dear refuge of no distant grave; I had no Christ, of whom with hopeless tears I sought a vision through unverdant years So mute and dreadful, harvesting but loss, Where all was care, and every thought a cross, That married me to woe's unuttered wail, And each desire a thorn, each step a nail. But yet I could not live without my Lord, And though the pathway to Him were a sword Which I must walk alone, one awful edge Of cold keen suffering, or some toppling ledge By precipices pale, still would I dare To go or climb if none therein had share With me. I asked the ruddy rolling sphere, And its response came back, “He is not here.” I asked the ocean, where I kept vain tryst, And stormy waiting for the Blessed Christ, If in those purple palaces His lot Was cast, and it replied, “I know Him not.” I asked the eagle on his royal path A flying bolt of ruin and of wrath, Free of the earth and water and the air In solitary silence fierce and fair, Whose eyes were all ablaze with battle sheen; But still the answer was, “I have not seen In halls of space a Master and the joy Of thy redemption—I, like death, destroy.” I asked the roses reddening in the sun, And laughing at the beauty scarce begun By right Divine, that had save grace no choice; And they replied, “We have not heard His voice.” I asked the pilgrim of the world, the wind, Which breathes of Arctic frost and flowers of Ind, And makes the earth with song and perfume sweet, But finds no place to rest its romping feet; Which whispered, “Though my travellings are much, I have not felt the impress of His touch.” I sought Him in the churches, where the spot Of carnal ease had fallen, and found Him not— My Beautiful, my Love, my King, my Life; I found but foolish babblement and strife Of consentaneous folly and wild screeds, And in mock thunder dead or dying creeds. The wardens of the word and oracles Spake in cheap wit or vulgar parables, And charmed their hearers with mere tinkling chimes, But had no trumpet message for the times To stir dry bones that rotted in their shame, And bid souls live and set the world aflame. While I consumed with struggling need and stress Would offer Him in utter brokenness My heart, myself, my all, to keep Him in, But knew not where for the besetting sin I might attain a strength to help me stand— The healing balm of His besetting Hand. I sought Him in the Senate, where the law Flowed from its ancient fountain head of awe In justice, and most reverend right and use With fertilising streams of power profuse, Watered the nations as they came to drink, And shed new life on nations prone to sink Foredoomed and pass; I saw with fair intents The mighty mother of all parliaments, Dispensing measures broadcast through the land, With equal aim and catholic command, Builded on base of precedent and rock; I saw with wonder, from the undying stock New constitutions bud in festival Of fervid youth and force magnifical, A grander growth; I saw the wide earth mount To vaster summits, from that one great fount Revived; but, ah, I did not see my Lord, Who gave those charters all their sweet accord And liberties their latitude. I sought Again in the calm cloistered world of thought, Where pale and pensive students with the stamp Of high imperial learning trimmed the lamp That lit the ages, and led countries on From unhewn stone to stately Parthenon, And pillared books with bards' tremendous line Compact of fire and tears and white moonshine, And marble might of loveliness, and stairs Of mist and silence blown about with airs, Like incense out of columned courts—the lore Spreading as waves, that sap an iron shore, And never can be spent. I noted how The kindling eye and broad contagious brow Caught every gleam of Truth and flashed it forth, As the Aurora flaming in the north, From heart to heart and made serener skies And other earths with fresh philosophies, The old writ larger; and I noted still The passion of the consecrated will, Vowed as a Vestal to the holy Truth And thence repairing evermore its youth, A-burning in the frail devoted form That could not veil the fire's translucent storm, As some sweet altar in a shadowed shrine Dreadful with hidden majesty Divine, With all around it solemnly illumed, And all within it bright and unconsumed; But Him I noted not, who is the Light Of every world that but reflects His sight. I sought Him in the market-place, where greed Pastured on helpless ignorance or need, Outbidding and outbawling poor men's pains, And with its muck-rake heaped the loathsome gains That were stark losses, preying on the weak Who starved and struggled nor had voice to speak. I marked the sweater gorged with blood and fat With tears of orphans, and the plutocrat— The monster deaf and blind as death and cold, A brute machine for coining cursed gold From lives of murdered men and women—filled With plunder, but not satisfied, not stilled; I marked the fraud in fashion, honoured, crowned, When unexposed and lofty, though it drowned Its myriads in a sea of damned despair, And unimagined ruin past repair; I marked the triumph of the chartered knaves Whose gilded progress lay o'er open graves Grim, and the lady's dress of purple proud, And precious which had been a sister's shroud; But Him I found not anywhere in all. I sought Him in the stable, at the stall, Where once He laid His little Baby Head, Though with the terrors of the Godhood spread About it still; but O, He was not there, Whose virtue yet I knew ranged everywhere Pervading and compelling with kind power The rolling planet and the radiant flower In fragrance and in light; I met Him not, The Chief among ten thousand, with no spot Or shadow of a stain upon His dress Of unconjecturable holiness; I felt His Beauty, but I could not touch The uttermost sweet hem I sought so much With care and prayer. No vestige of His tread Among the brutes for whom His Blood was shed, His covenanted creatures; but the strife Of bastard science, and the crimson knife That carved its fatal conquests on the flesh Of hopeless bleeding lives, and carved afresh Its hideous blots and blunders, to apply The shame of some poor shambling theory And pluck from nameless horrors what might suit Or riot on the old forbidden fruit, With services of ghastly hecatombs Offered to Moloch in grim catacombs. I sought Him in the teardrop's costly gem, The red light lingering on the fir tree stem, The cry of hunted anguish low and long, The wood dove crooning its wild evensong, In windy ways of sea, in man and beast, At gloomy fast and at the glittering feast, In pomp and pageant and the funeral, Through mocking loves and hates majestical; But though I wandered far, and kept a tryst With death itself, I could not see the Christ. I sought Him humbly with heart-broken pleas By the soft murmur of untravelled seas, And over mountains and gray desert sands Where rocks arose and stretched forbidding hands Like skeletons; I asked the land and sky, But vainly—till I came to Calvary, By bitter roads that led through doors of loss, Where hung the shadow of a shameful Cross Betwixt the heaven and earth, and on it still The Sacrifice of Love and subject Will, Lashed by strange winds that seemed at angry strife, He whose perpetual death is all our Life, For whom remained no less or diverse plan, The dying God and the undying Man In unimaginable sorrow bent, But more than Conqueror now and most content, Within that awful darkness which is Light To us, and every universe of night With robes of suffering woe and sin enwrapt In systems undiscovered and unmapt; The service of the Priest who offers up Himself, and drinks alone the dreadful cup Of anguish and fierce overflowing wine In innocence of human joy divine; Who saveth others from the yawning grave, Eternity's black mouth, but cannot save Himself and will not, though by tortures tried— My Beautiful, the Ever-Crucified. I found Him, where I left Him long ago, Nailed to the Cross which is our guide below And beacon lamp and refuge from the storm, While His great Passion shook the gentle Form That yet embraced and chose with loving breath The agony of endless living Death. There I renewed my vows at wells of Truth And washed in waters of immortal youth, When through the gateway of the grave I went And passed to Life and that august ascent Of resurrection and the holy ground, And dropt behind me every chain and bound. But then my eyes were opened, and I saw That solemn spectacle of bliss and awe, Christ on the Cross in every lot and land, The wounded Side, the pierced outspreading Hand In benediction that could only thus At this stupendous price be bought for us, But by the Blood of God who cannot err— Most willing and most sinless Sufferer. And every milestone marked by love and loss, Which led to Him was just the Sacred Cross; There was no other signpost through the dark, Save this one witness of our Hierarch. I saw it in the sunshine of the throne, For there He hung uncared-for and alone, While all the cruel splendour babbled by And left The King in stark extremity Of solitary shame. I saw it low Among the masses and the muddy flow Of wrangling hates and meannesses, that crept From crime to crime and gorged the flesh and slept, And woke to strive and gorge again and sin— There stood the Cross, and He to all akin, However sunk and fouled in moral mire His brothers—there rose up the blood-red spire, The fountainhead of life and every good, The strength of man, the dew of maidenhood, Unseen, unhonoured and unsought, unknown, But still the central fact unoverthrown And everlasting. By the crookèd gait, By him who dwelleth in the street called Straight And steps right onward to the duty nigh, Betwixt the heaving bosom and the sigh And dying men and dead, within the feast, Above the science butcher and the beast Mangled and murdered for a passing play, While angels weep and fiends hold holiday, I saw the vision of Divine distress, The Cross of Christ, the dread great Loveliness For ever crucified, for ever sweet, White hands of blessing rent and riven white feet; I found in every home the bitter cry, In every heart a hidden Calvary. MY STAFF. “Thy Rod and Thy Staff, they comfort me.” I begged the Master for a staff, To stay a pilgrim poor And scatter perils like the chaff Upon the threshing-floor; Whereon I might securely lean And walk the narrow way, Unsoiled in circuits all unclean Where vice keeps holiday; A strong assurance for endurance In burdens on me laid, A constant token of unbroken Communion and His aid. I asked not for a sceptre's gold, The bauble of a king, But something sweetened by His hold Where safely I could cling; That would not fail in utmost need At the first angry gust, And snapping like a bruisèd reed Betray my settled trust; That wore no traces of the graces From dying art or earth, Nor was a witness to unfitness Foredoomed at very birth. The Master listened to my cry, And freely gave the staff That stayed me in extremity, And scattered fears like chaff; It was not what I had desired Though better than I sought, Yet past the summits I aspired To reach my footsteps brought; Because its fashion was the Passion Whereby He also trod, The blessèd sifting and uplifting Of suffering and the Rod. And thus the sorrow on me bound In sickness and through loss, By faith a comforter was found— I leaned upon my cross; The prop, which I with idle quest Pursued to help me stand And yield the refuge and the rest, Itself was in my hand; And now for ever each endeavour Is beautiful and free, I bear no straining load or paining— The cross, it carries me. OVER THE RED LEAVES. In the sad season whose torches had kindled the woodlands and shades Rolling their splendour through porches of quiet and dim colonnades, Under the breast of the pigeon and over the red leaves of fire Came to me like a religion the light of a holy desire, Came in the sunset and glamour of colour and ravishing balm When all the world and its clamour were lost in an infinite calm; Pulse of a passionate craving for something above and yet nigh Bred between resting and slaving, born between love and the sigh, Marked by the sweep of the swallow dividing the air for its food, Felt in the hush of the hollow and breathed in a maidenly mood. Ever one beautiful yearning for what I still longed to achieve Taught not by books and the learning of wisdom that did but deceive, Quest for a virginal era of peace where no trumpet was blown, Chase of a hopeless chimera and graces unheard and unknown— Ever that impulse had haunted my seeking by night and by day Stemmed not by mockers who taunted me, starved not by death or decay, Leading me on with a vision that yet I interpreted not Right in the teeth of derision and enmity and hatred and plot, Full of unspeakable sorrow and big with unquenchable joy Bridging to-day and to-morrow and time as if only a toy; Strong as necessity calling me, through the vain babble of earth Surging in billows, and falling as lightly as dew upon dearth; Calm with an iron compulsion that drew me from baubles of gain Back by a bitter revulsion to penance and exquisite pain, Forward like destiny lifting me over impassable bars Idly erected and rifting the fogs and unveiling the stars; Yet it was gentle and lowly, and softer than infancy sleep, Breathing an atmosphere holy and rounded by silences deep, Stealing like snowflakes that stilly descend from its winterly womb, Out of All-Space when the shrilly fierce blasts are at rest in their tomb. Thirsting, unsatisfied hunger that raised me to dizzy ascents, Thought re-creating me younger than children, divine discontents, Weariness, doubtings importunate, touched with a beautiful fear, Moments of error unfortunate, smiles blotted out with a tear, Terrible dumbness and flashes of speech, the disconsolate voice Mourning above its gray ashes and mocked by the crimes that rejoice, Sudden recoils from the awful great plunge into deeps of the dark, Trifling with treasures unlawful and ladders of song with the lark, Emptiness aching and lonely, the populous roar of the mart, Failure when failure was only the tenant that stifled the heart; These were the feelings and fancies that lashed me with pitiless thong Over my ruined romances by profitless marchings along, Through the great pillars of broken white temples that scaled the blue sky Rich with a promise unspoken and poets' unsyllabled cry, Whither I knew not by windings of desert and mountain and moor Tricked by the turns and the findings that never yet opened one door; Seeking I knew not what haven in regions unguessed and unmapt, Though on my heart was engraven a hope with which earth seemed enwrapt, Through all the dead and the living and through all the ominous air Sapping the whole with misgiving and counsels of gloom and despair. Thus did I suffer and travel the worlds of the wandering thought Helpless, and could not unravel the riddle the centuries wrought, Till in the autumn and setting of suns that had guided me wrong, Came with a kindly forgetting of each old enchantment and song Under the breast of the pigeon and over the red leaves of fire— Came to me like a religion the light of a holy desire, Out of All-Time into vision and glory that suddenly brake Sweet with a solemn decision and bade my dark besom awake. Not in vain pomps that bedizen the fool for his soul and its loss Clear on the golden horizon was painted in scarlet a Cross, Written in blood and the letters put forth at an infinite grief Paid for the loosing of fetters demanding that awful relief. Then like a mist of black draping my doubts in a moment were gone, Truth in its masterful shaping before me no mystery shone Beaconing home, and my error which sent me in search of the Crown Dwindled away with the terror that long held its prisoner down. Now in each horrible stigma and study of passion and pain All undeserved the enigma and trouble of life became plain, Now I beheld as in lightning and blazoned with beautiful tears Broadening for ever and brightening the secret of sorrowing years. Not to the Cross is the journey of pilgrims who seek for the Crown Ready to strive in the tourney with evil and win them renown; Nay, but the Cross is the starting of faith when it steps to the fight, Bucklered and brave at the parting of ways in the shadow or light Upward or down, and the mortal who fain would be victor and son, Enters alone by the portal which oped for the Crucified One, Hanging himself and his burden of sin with which sorely he ails Only to find the fair guerdon at last on the jewelling nails. SECTION IV. Grammar of Grace. GRAMMAR OF GRACE. Lord, I am but a little child, And have not learned the spelling Which only leaves us good and mild, And curbs the proud rebelling; Though in the Grammar of Thy Grace, The pupils always see God's face, And need no harsh compelling. For ages past the rod was broken With Thy dear bleeding heart, Wherein all have a part; While thence the ransomed earth is soaken, And fountains living start. But still I study in Thy school, I pick out here a letter And there another, as a tool To shape me wise and better; For not a lesson is as hard As my own will against Thee barr'd, Which hugs each naughty fetter. But at the service that is freedom I rudely pout and pine, And cross the danger line To seek forbidden fruits of Edom, Instead of tasks Divine. There is not very much to learn, A line or two, a copy For which we all at seasons yearn When tired of pleasure's poppy; That we may trace Thy footsteps hid By shame and shadows bright, amid The rabble rude and shoppy. And if I look at Thee but blindly, Yet Thou dost not forget; And though my sins beset, Thy hands beset me closer, kindly, And teach the alphabet. O let me try upon my knees To master what is simple, Read with the murmur of the bees And in a baby's dimple; That tiny word of blessèd trust, Which raiseth worlds that else were dust, And ties the maiden's wimple. Till I can build at last a sentence In parts that fitly twine, And prove its meaning mine— The riches of a free repentance, And human love Divine. MY CROWN. I begged the Master for a crown Such as the chosen wear, Who with the thunder of renown A nation's honour bear; Who in the light of noble deeds Work on with faithful friends, And armoured all in golden creeds, To their appointed ends; Who in the beauty born of duty Stand steadfast at the helm, And toiling tarry not and carry The greatness of a realm. I thought I had an equal hand Of their imperial kind, To dare the utmost and command, To loosen or to bind; I thought I had a conquering will, Above mere place and pelf, To find my good in others' ill, And rule no less myself; I thought my splendid hope was blended With purpose for the poor, And larger vision's clear decisions, Would open wide their door. But then the Master heard my voice, In all the eager pride, Which deemed it made a kingly choice, To labour at His side; He granted me my prayer at length, Not just as I besought, And added with the gift a strength, To do what He inwrought; He for my payment took His raiment Of earthly scoffs and scorns, To clothe my bareness with that fairness, And His own crown of thorns. At first it seemed a crushing load Which never let me rest, A ceaseless fretting and a goad, Whose iron pierced my breast; But in the grinding of the grief I found the saving balm, The very pain was its relief, The scourge the victor's palm; And thus the burden grew the guerdon Which gave the needed power, While my torn bosom seemed to blossom, And every thorn a flower. THE WALK OF FAITH. The way seemed dark and lonely and the clouds a funeral wreath, But as I went it only spread my footsteps flowers beneath; The stocks with threatening gesture now uplifted me on thrones, The shades grew shining vesture and the blocks were stepping stones; The giants and the terrors dwindled to a harmless wraith, And all my fears were errors—for I walked alone by faith. I looked below, it darkened, and a horror filled my breast, I looked above and harkened and sweet tidings brought me rest; I looked behind, the lion strode with progress grim as fate's, I looked before and Sion flashed on me its pearly gates; I looked within for leading and a voice of treason talked, I looked without unheeding—for by faith alone I walked. The way was deep and narrow, bitter thorns about were spread, Their teeth that were a harrow pierced my naked hands and head; But yet the wounds were pleasant with a blessing of their own, Because the One was present who as saving balm was sown; In beauty burst the thistles just as spirits from their spathe, And blossoms sprang from bristles—for I walked alone by faith. O when in wrath and thunder clove the ground with earthquake shock, And failed my feet, yet under all I felt the Eternal Rock; The awful void seemed paven and the bars were helping hands, The storm was quite a haven blowing me to heavenly lands; And in the knell of danger I heard but the Bridegroom's tone, While sin was still a stranger—for I walked by faith alone. EMPTIED. Breathing peace and joy the Master, Came unto me in the night Of my grieving and disaster, Whispering “Let there be light!” So the sorrow and its curtain, Which eclipsed the noon of day, With its clouds and rays uncertain, Rolled for evermore away; For He took on Him my trouble Till it brightened into bliss, While He made my gladness double With a sacramental kiss. Then He murmured “Not by merit Of the toils and duties done, Canst thou hope now to inherit Pardon and with Me be one; Not by strife upon high stages Trodden and great lessons learned, Falls the blessing for thy wages, As a right by labour earned; Thou must be an emptied vessel, Cleansed of all the self and sin, And the lusts that with thee wrestle, Ere I make My home within.” Therefore I arose in quickness, Eager to be purged of each Vanity and fretful sickness, Woe to life within its reach; And the passions like a canker Gnawing at my secret breast, Which forbade my heart to anchor On the only Rock of Rest, I assailed with prayer and sentence Written in the Holy Book, And with vigil and repentance Which of strength Divine partook. Ugly appetites that festered, Down below and left a scar, In this grim retreat sequestered, Fled like baffled fiends afar; Serpentine and evil errors Coiled about my very soul, Strangling with their tricks and terrors All that malice could control, Found no more in me the portion Which they once had pastured on, In their time of dark distortion, And before the truth were gone. Thus by grace I cleansed the vessel Surely for the Master's use, Pure from lusts that strove to nestle Under some devout excuse; Purged it with His hyssop sweetly From the follies that would cling, Formed the whole at last completely To a palace for the King; Swept it throughly of the tarnished Glory which had left it lone, Till it shone forth fair and garnished, Not unworthy of His throne. Then the Lord who smelled a savour Fresher than a maiden's thought, Low descended in His favour On the dwelling I had wrought; And He filled me with His fulness Beautiful and strong and free, And discrowned the old gray dulness With a splendour good to see; And His fragrance glad and glowing Cannot in my breast be bound, But with blessèd overflowing Scatters light and love around. STRIPT. Once the Master dear came to me, When I really knew Him not, Though His presence all went through me, While it strangely stirred my lot; And I listened to Him blindly With a dull astonished ear, As He whispered to me kindly Words most wonderful to hear; Yet I hearkened to His message And the music of His voice, For my conscience felt a presage Of a new and nobler choice. Then He spoke, “Take off the clothing Which impedes thy heavenward race, And remember that betrothing Which was promise of My grace; For thou canst not run in fervent Zeal one step upon the road Thus encumbered, as my servant, With an idle heavy load; And I may not help thy struggles, For the victory and right, When the world of falsehood juggles With the leadings of the Light.” So I eased me of the raiment Which I gathered on my course, And demanded no re-payment In my penitent remorse; And the pride that made me stumble With its many-coloured dress, I renounced for garments humble Meet for my unworthiness; And the vulgar earthly wrappings Which retarded me so long, I laid low with gaudy trappings, And took up a sacred song. And the vanity that clogged me In the steep and stony track, While its evil shadows dogged me, All I cast behind my back; And the scarlet tire of pleasure Which for years had dragged me down, With the tinsel I deemed treasure And the roses' fading crown, I put off and raised my carol Higher yet to Him who led, While I thought of His apparel And the thorns about His head. I discarded every vesture That entangled me and stayed Under bondage, or by gesture False on doubtful paths delayed; Though I did my service dumbly, And in darkness followed yet, And my hands rejected numbly All the robes that still beset; Till I left no rag remaining Or pretension to atone, And stood stript and uncomplaining In my nakedness alone. Then the Master came in blessing, And His Spirit moved with might, And His touch that fell caressing Now arrayed me all in light; For He garmented my nothing With His own exceeding Grace, And I carried as my clothing The reflection of His Face; For I found the road of duty Kept me walking at His side, And when sheltered by His beauty I was dressed and satisfied. COR DULCE MEUM. I yearned for friendship more than man Had ever yearned before, Since first this beating heart began To wonder and adore— Since like a bird it tried to flutter, Its wings unfledged, and fain would utter The hope it hardly dared to mutter, The love it would implore; And like an open flower my breast Which sought a clearer sight, Turned in its eager onward quest To every ray of light. Mine was a hunger in the frame, And cutting as a knife, That with the fretting of its flame Consumed my inmost life; I cared not for the earthly laurels Which were to me but bells and corals, I strove not in my fellows' quarrels For any vulgar strife; I thirsted for no common friend Who could not satisfy, I craved no solace with an end Short of eternity. I found a man of lofty mind, Who served his country well, And left the sordid baits behind, At which the weaker fell; To him I gave—and did not falter— Myself as on a sacred altar, For O I would not lightly palter With love's pure golden spell; But while it drew me upward still, As he in strength arose And shaped me with his iron will, I did not gain repose. I won a maid of magic form Who blossomed glad and good, Unmoved by ill of lust or storm In whitest womanhood; To her from darkness and dejection I offered up a whole affection, And waited for that resurrection, Unknown but understood; Yet though she was a spotless thing, I reaped no perfect rest Whereto I might for ever cling— Even on her snowy breast. I had a child of every charm, Like wedded light and air, Who leant upon my sheltering arm While growing still more fair; In him I thought at last was ended, The search by which I still contended For peace, and I had now ascended Past all my long despair; But, ah, he sickened in one day Within my very clasp, And in his beauty passed away Beyond my wistful grasp. But then the doors of Heaven rolled back From each fond useless tryst, Revealing on my erring track The treasures wrongly priced; But behind man and woman sainted, And child with glory not untainted, The joy for which my soul had fainted, My sweetest heart, the Christ! The earthly answers to my call Seemed shadows poor and dim, And marriage, fatherhood and all, Were only steps to Him. BROKEN. (1 C. 11, 24 and J. 12, 3). Christ of His holy splendour, Perfect and with no flaw, Gave a supreme surrender, Bowing to earthly law; Yielded His flesh as token True of a boundless grace, Verily to be broken Once within death's embrace; Ever for all who tarry Neither for lure nor loss, Fain in His steps to carry Still the upraising cross. Thus with the blessèd ointment's Savour the earth was filled, Darkness and disappointments All at His message thrilled; Over the peoples vagrant Passed that transforming air, Till every life made fragrant Grew with its beauty fair; Till, though with love not spoken, Master of fear and doubt, Each stubborn heart was broken, Pouring its sweetness out. DAILY BREAD. Dear Lord, I bless the token Sealed with that solemn price, I hail Thy body broken In the one sacrifice; For me in nameless anguish Thy precious blood was shed, And for Thy food I languish— Be Thou my daily bread. Dear Lord, I will remember In hours of sunny Spring And darkest life's December The awful Offering: For me Thy Side was riven, And bowed the bruisèd Head, To me the sins forgiven— Be Thou my daily bread. Dear Lord I starve and stumble, Except on Thee the first, I feed with spirit humble, And satisfy my thirst; For me in pain and sadness That holy feast was spread To bring me light and gladness— Be Thou my daily bread. Dear Lord, Thy death is token That now henceforth must be My sinful body broken, My life outpoured for Thee; But useless is my straining, And idly am I led, Unless with hope sustaining, Thou art my daily bread. THE BABY WE LOVE. Bring to the waking of duty and taking The seal from above, In its excellent meekness and infinite weakness The baby we love; Helplessness only and lovely but lonely And lost without this, The Divine dedication, the true consecration, The sacrament kiss; Bring it to making of beauty and breaking Of earthlier ties, With its innocent gesture that asks the white vesture, Whose grace never dies. Wash in the fountain that flows from the mountain, Whereby we must live, In its pitiful sweetness that craves this completeness, The baby we give; Bathe it in waters that crown our fair daughters With wonderful gifts, And our sons with the merit they do not inherit In strength that uplifts; Cleanse it from staining and evil's enchaining, Asleep in the blood, That the bonds may be shattered and enmity scattered By the mystical flood. Mark for the fighting with God's own hand-writing That traces our creed, With the sign of the lowly and pledge of the holy, The baby we need; Born into battle and meant with its prattle Our shadows to light, And in awful new pureness to beacon with sureness Our footsteps through night; Stamp it with token the word has been spoken That blesses with loss, And the Church in the manner of old gives the banner, The world-shaking Cross. Leave in the holding of Christ and the folding Of life from above, Beyond earth and its welter within the one shelter, The baby we love; Treasure so little and vessel so brittle Unmade by a fall, Not for storms or the wearing of strife, and yet bearing Eternity's all; Leave it for ever, without one endeavour To lessen the rod That afflicts but with kindness, and leave it in blindness Alone with its God. VIA CRUCIS, VIA LUCIS. Oft I heard companions say, Pretty is the primrose way, For it leads by laughing waters Through the pastures glad and green, Where the dark eyed siren daughters In their witcheries are seen; And I trod the flowery meadows In the dappled shine and shadows, But they quickly all turned grey; Via crucis Via lucis, And there is no other way. Oft I saw how pleasures goad Myriads on the downward road, Beautiful and broad and pleasant As if it would ever last, With the promise of the present And the sweetness of the past; I essayed to live the story Full of fantasies and glory, But it changed to penal wrath; Via crucis Via lucis, And there is no other path. Oft I meet the festive throng, Luring me with dance and song, When the heat of noontide scorches And the burden galls my back, To the cool and sheltered porches, On the many-fountained track; And at times I burst the border, Tasting fruits of fair disorder, But they pass to bitter lack; Via crucis Via lucis, And there is no other track. Oft I feel a secret sin Opening honeyed depths within; Urging me to soft recesses On that old and easy course, Where the warm and fond caresses Leave but ashes of remorse; I have drunk the tempting chalice, But to find the dregs of malice And the sorrow born of play; Via crucis Via lucis, And there is no other way. SON OF GOD—SON OF MAN. What words shall I to Thee address Who kiss Thy mercy's rod, Thou awful and sweet Loveliness, Christ Jesus, Son of God? Mine eyes I cannot lift to Thee, They blinded are with sin, Until Thou bid'st the darkness flee And grantest light within. I may but smite upon my breast, This evil breast of mine, That seeks and never finds the rest Which makes man's heart Divine. I feel Thy holy presence near In silence and in flame, Betwixt the trouble and the tear, The shadow and the shame. A solemn wonder fills my soul From which I vainly fly, And round me like the ocean roll Thy waves, eternity. At last, my Saviour, Thou hast come, In Thy calm cleansing fire, Though I have stubborn thoughts and some Are mingled with the mire. But Thou wast likewise man, and all I suffer and disown, The temptings but without the fall, To Thee are not unknown. And Thou didst choose a lowly lot, Who hadst Thy diadem Of many suns and stars forgot, The Babe of Bethlehem. For Thou wast born to every ill And ache and cruel death, And from Thee flows in mercy still Like heaven Thy human breath. A Man of Sorrows from the first Thou hadst the scourging blame, And nought could give Thy dreadful thirst The love for which it came. Into a world of woe and dearth, Welfare for us to win, Accursèd Thou didst enter earth, And sinless wast made sin. And thus Thou knowest my distress Who hast our weakness worn, When life was all one wilderness And every thought a thorn. The sufferings under which I sink Thy portion were and more, The bitter cup that I must drink Thou drankest it before. Yes, Thou didst walk with healing hand And break the sceptred death, About that bright and blessed land Where sleeps Thy Nazareth. The will not waked by priestly art Bent to Thy sovereign power, And many a cold and withered heart Burst into happy flower. Oh, Thou didst look with human eyes Into these eyes of tears, And as a Sun of glory rise Upon our world of fears. For earthly lamps that could but cheat Thou broughtest heavenly oil, Bearing the burden and the heat Of all our grinding toil. Thou gavest to the dying health, That hushed the fever strife, And to the leper soul the wealth Of Thy most wondrous Life. And none besought Thy help in vain, And none besought too much, For every grief and every pain Fled at Thy quickening touch. Thy word was freedom to the slave, And calmed the tempest song, The buried heard and from his grave Upstarted free and strong. And yet Thou art the very same, Though not to mortal sight, Yet is there music in Thy name, Thy shadow yet is light. And Thou wilt take this little heart To which my frailties cling, And purge it through and set apart A palace for the King. I see Thy justice like the night, I see Thy conquering love, Which when I turn in hopeless flight Spreads its blue heaven above. And so I stay my trembling feet On that most holy place, Where truth and boundless mercy meet, Within God's own embrace. I know my strongest faith is weak, My deepest love is dead; I dare not look, I cannot speak, I only bow the head. And yet I see, I have no choice Who in Thy vision share, While all my spirit finds a voice And rushes forth in prayer. I come as of Thy fellow-men, 'Tis but a little way, One step outside of self, and then That bright and endless day. I bring no gifts, no righteous plea That might Thy pity move, I simply cast me on the sea Of shoreless unmapped Love. Above me opes another sky, Beneath another land, And in Thy dread Divinity I touch a human hand. Because Thou art so very high, And I so very small, I dare to bring myself so nigh, My sorrow, sin, and all. I only find (as now I come), Refuge from Thee in Thee, For Thou my Saviour art the Home I sought and could not see. In Thee I trust and nothing less, A sinner as I can, Thou sweet and awful loveliness, Christ Jesus, Son of Man. HIS POEM ARE WE. Eph. ii. 10. 'Tis written in the Book which cannot lie, And will our beacon be, While lesser lights of earth must droop and die— “Poem of God are we;” Made to express the greatness of the plan, The image sure of Him, Divinity, that hath a home in man, However it be dim; Meant for a witness to the truth, that yet Is the long ages' cry, And our God's being, who in hearts hath set His own eternity. Am I “His poem,” reflex of the will, All-gentle and all-just? And do my wishes His re-echo still, In simple child-like trust? Ah! do my hands that often fret and strain, With His grand working rhyme, And evermore beat out (if even through pain), The old sweet heavenly chime? Aud do my wayward steps delight to be One, up the Calvary slope, With His who richly there has wrought for me A future and a hope? God is the Poet, and He works in us To walk His glorious ways, To think and do His righteousness, and thus Bring in the better days; He builds us up high in the eternal scheme, Word joined to living word, Each in his place part of the song supreme, By the pure spirit heard; Verse matched with verse, in loving order laid To shape a holy shrine— Precept on jewelled precept strongly stayed, Line upon golden line. Oh, daily would He polish me, and bright And brighter make my track, Who gives a lustre in the darkest night, To lead his wanderers back; And hourly doth He mould me to the form Of the fair final grace, By iron strokes of the distressful storm, That veils a Father's face; Till purified by loss, my soul He draws In a yet tenderer tie, “His poem” breathing but His perfect laws— Poem that cannot die. LITANY. God of mercy, God of might, Dwelling in the day and night And revealed to love as Light, Hear us, Father, hear. God of patience, God of power, That in the last lonely hour Burst upon the Cross in flower, Help us, Saviour, help. God of wisdom, God of Life, In repentance quickening strife, Though with sacrificial knife, Holy Spirit, come. Heavenly Father, when to Thee Low we trembling bow the knee, And but doubts and darkness see, Hear us, Father, hear. Blessed Saviour, bid the trust, Clinging to Thee as it must, Live and bud in very dust, Help us, Saviour, help. Holy Spirit, calm and strong, When the labouring day is long Turning sadness into song, Holy Spirit, come. God of ages, God of all, Present at the feeblest call, To whom nothing weak is small, Hear us, Father, hear. God of gladness, God of hope, When we climb the cloudy slope, And great doors of danger ope, Help us, Saviour, help. God of promise, God of grace, Though the glory veil Thy face, And our hearts have little space, Holy Spirit, come. Heavenly Father, who wilt heed Wounded bird and bruisèd reed, And dost us Thy children need, Hear us, Father, hear. Blessed Saviour, when we sink On the precipice's brink, Fain to flee, afraid to think, Help us, Saviour, help. Holy Spirit, true and tried, Daily by our lips denied, Who hast yet all wants supplied, Holy Spirit, come. God of sinners, God of saints, When the breast with sorrow faints At the guilt which memory taints, Hear us, Father, hear. God of blessing, God of peace, If our passions will not cease, Giving to the slave release, Help us, Saviour, help. God of conscience, God of care, Though ourselves we will not spare, Sweet in penitence and prayer, Holy Spirit, come. Heavenly Father, we are frail, Often fret and often fail, But if we with sickness ail, Hear us, Father, hear. Blessèd Saviour, make our faith, Lured not by a dazzling wraith, Rest on what the Scripture saith, Help us, Saviour, help. Holy Spirit, if we bend In the storm without a friend, Thou who canst all comfort send, Holy Spirit, come. NULLA CRUX, O QUANTA CRUX! ST. AUGUSTINE. God unknown and yet so clear, 'Twixt the tear drop and the tear, Girdled round by hope and fear, In this cosmic ebb and flux, One thing doth Thy servant know, Out of passing pomp and show, With their awful afterglow— Nulla crux, O quanta crux! Lord, I am an ignorant child, Always weak and sometimes wild, And with sinning sore defil'd, Yet I have this wisdom won From the flushing of the flower, At the triumph of the tower, In the pride of noonday power— That the heaviest cross is none. God unknown, and yet so dear, Who the voiceless cry dost hear, And wilt blunt the deadly spear, I have learnt the greatest loss— In the fortune fair and bright, When vain pleasures reach their height, And the angels take their flight— Not to have an earthly cross. Maker, whom I dimly serve With a faint and flagging nerve, Though my footsteps often swerve Ere the tiniest task is done, I am taught this solemn fact, In the thunder of the act Wrought to bridge an empire's pact— That the hardest cross is none. God unknown, and yet as nigh As the sadness to the sigh, While enthroned in splendour high, What is gold without the dross? If no battle hath been fought And the victory comes unbought That by suffering was not sought, What the crown without the cross? Sovereign, in the sweetest cup, When with saints I fondly sup, Yet a shadow riseth up— In all happiness is one; Nowise would I wish it less, If that Thou my portion bless, Thou mete though in fire distress; For a sharper cross were none. Master, make not day too bright, Nor the penance brief and light, Do not take away the night If the tempests round me toss; I will not resign one pain, I will kiss the captive chain, And renounce the grandest gain, For the cradling of Thy cross. Father, Thine the glory be, And the burden fall on me, Till the shadows break and flee, And the rest falls after flux; Leave some briars in my crop, Let me taste the bitter drop, For, if once Thy chastening stop, Nulla crux O quanta crux! THE WONDER OF IT. O God, how beautiful to live And on Thy bosom lie, A part of all, if fugitive And only made to die! O more than wonderful to be At all, upon this globe That is a shadowy glimpse of Thee, A glimmer of Thy robe. I am content to love and trust And look in silent praise, Though I be only as the dust Thy passing footsteps raise. THE HARVEST. Thou hast come to the reckoning now and the harvest; Reaper what hast thou sown; Didst thou say to the needy one, “Brother, thou starvest; Make my plenty thine own?” Hast thou stood betwixt weakness and want, with thy shoulder Bearing burdens for them, And received on thy bosom their wounds, waxing bolder, With storms they could not stem? Didst thou sow the good seed of a great human kindness In the wilderness dearth, Or bid sunshine arise on the refuge of blindness To regenerate earth? Wast thou hands to the helpless and feet to the falling And release to the bound, Or a bridge to the exile's captivity calling As from burial ground? Could the wail of misfortune so shadowed by malice Ever darken thy joy, Or the sigh of the suffering poison its chalice And deny thee one toy? Thou hast come to the judgment at last and the reaping; Sinner what hast thou sown? But the thorns and the thistles of lust, for the heaping Of a vengeance unknown? Didst thou share thy rich fulness with him who lacked clothing And besought it in vain, Giving aught to the naked who wept and had nothing But the garment of pain? Hast thou spared of thy crusts to the sister who pleaded In her misery rough, When she passed by thy palace gates lone and unheeded, Though thy dogs had enough? Would'st thou enter the prison and loose but a fetter If beyond thy proud class, Or just leave by thy presence the earth around better By a blade of green grass? Didst thou strive in the struggle for life that is labour Where the feeble ones fall, With an arm for the faint and an ear for the neighbour In the vilest of all? Hast thou once with a finger helped one with the burden Of his sorrow or sin, And found sacrifice sweeter than victory's guerdon, Or felt mourners akin? Thou hast come to the trial, the close and the sentence, Sleeper, what hast thou sown? There is no place for pardon, no time for repentance, Now the harvest is grown. MISSIONARY HYMN. Fight on, fight on, though fiercely rattle The fiery arrows on the shield By faith uplifted, for the battle Is still the Lord's, and who will yield? Fight on, fight on, we dare not linger, The trumpet notes of the command Call us, the Cross with solemn finger Our banner is that none withstand; Fight on, fight on, o'er ridge and hollow Of foaming wave and furrowed shore, God fights with us, and we must follow When Christ has conquered all before. Work on, work on, but not for wages On burning plains and fields of frost, If wildly round the tempest rages And often all but Christ is lost; Work on, work on, the day is flying, And scanty time at most we give, For some are dead and some are dying, But all who hear the message live; Work on, work on, for night is nearer, With patient toil and holy plan, God works with us, and what is dearer To brothers than their brother man? Trust on, trust on, for faith is living And from the heavenly fountains drawn, And all our doubt and dark misgiving Are but the heralds of the dawn; Trust on, trust on, the Word is certain That will the distant Sinim seal, And from far Ind the heathen curtain Shall drop and Christ the Truth reveal; Trust on, trust on, though weakness hanker For pleasant ports by which we sail, God is our faith, we may but anchor Upon that Rock which cannot fail. Love on, love on, in spite of danger And falling men and martyrs gone, Who died to save from death the stranger, Fill up the broken ranks, go on; Love on, love on, the sons and daughters Of palmy isles shall hear our plea, And love shall cover earth, as waters That cover all the boundless sea; Love on, love on, while one to cherish And teach the Gospel yet remains, For God is love, and though we perish, He still the glorious work sustains. THE FOUNTAIN. I had a vision of a fountain fair Whose home was heaven, whose path the purple air; It clove a mountain's living heart, and fell Soft as the snow, sweet as a silver bell, Throughout all space and time for ever on By laughing lea and pillared Parthenon, And green green valley where the golden grape Drew in the summer and took hue and shape Mid red rose maidens white; for ever down, By stony steppe, and black tormented town At evil strife where angry figures reared Rebellious brows of hate and disappeared, Through solitude of sullen waste and smoke Of countless peoples that as billows broke At the calm feet of God like weary spray, And flashed a moment and then passed away; For ever on, for ever down it fell, A thing of wonder, an ineffable Joy, in a lengthening line of light . . . A cloud Of glory beyond measure pure and proud, Above its head hung as the sunrise breaks First upon some new world that just awakes To life and conscious beauty and its wreath Of stars like pearls and diamonds . . . But beneath, Poised on a crag, a stately woman stood In all the splendour of her womanhood, Bare to her breasts; and the dark flowing locks Threaded with dawn on those eternal rocks, Made beautiful sweet midnight for a space Around her; but the morning from her face Shone out in conquering strength. A giant form, Built to its perfect comeliness by storm And stress of dangers trodden down, she set Triumphant feet white on red ground, and met The kisses of the sun with kiss. Her eyes So full of stories and dear ecstasies, Gazed down the broadening brightening stream, and took All ages in the compass of her look. But her clear hand, as carven out of stone, Wrought by some artist who wrought that alone And died content, a crystal pitcher held Which with the sparkling waters laughed and swelled, And overflowed and danced and laughed again At its abundance of refreshing rain, And overflowed in music and in might, Always beneath the insufferable light Of a perpetual summer—always thus Poured out its wealth in multitudinous Waves, as if (smitten by some prophet's rod) That fountain was the broken heart of God. And there she stood, and glanced not once behind, Crowned with the beauty of all womankind. Her gracious bust of snow, that rose and fell In rhythmic rapture none might syllable, Seemed laden with a universal love That betwixt earth and heaven kept watch above The kingdoms of the world, and cared for each, And gathered every one within its reach, Infinite, cosmic, and provided food For high and low in that rich motherhood. But under her I saw a boundless throng Of many peoples, who with praise and song Brought cups of precious gold and filled them high From her, till theirs ran over and the sigh Of souls beyond them stilled, and these once more For others and yet these with bursting store Exceeded, for the thirsty who their fate Felt and the fountain sought at last though late, And drank and lived. But ever, till the sight Was lost in utter distance and delight, I saw the myriads of the nations borne By one wild impulse through the mist to morn, And in their masses crowding with the pride Of holy passion to the quickening tide, And drinking, drinking still in the new day New life, while every shadow passed away. But yet with bosom bare the woman stood In the full splendour of her womanhood, And freely took and freely gave to all Whoe'er would have and felt the secret call And craving. High the mountain raised its breast, That from its riven heart the living rest Gave out in one unending stream. And on The awful fountain flowed, the glory shone. “TWO MITES.” Father, I have not much to give, Not honour that should be To the dear Light wherein I live, And all was given by Thee; For gold and silver have I none, And grandeur of high place Or glory of great service done, My worship cannot grace; No wisdom do I bring, no lore That were an incense sweet, No treasures of one worthy store, To render at Thy feet. But yet, my Father I would come, If not with costly price That of its fulness yields but some, To pay my sacrifice; For without Thee I err and fall, Nor could I offer less When unto Thee I offer all I am and I possess; And here before Thee now I lay, Though not in pompous rites, And only as a beggar may, My tribute of “two mites.” Father, my mortal body take, A trouble long to me, And with Thy touch its weakness make A temple fit for Thee; Come, in the blessing that is power To this frail dying flesh, And in it as in Eden's bower Thy will shall bloom afresh; My lips and hands and feet refine. Although they seek Thee late, Stamp them with the pure seal Divine For Thee, and consecrate. And O my Father, keep this heart Which cannot keep its own, That it may never more depart From Thee, when truly known; Yes, take my sinful soul, that turns At times to folly still, And as Thy love within it burns Show that alone can fill; No tempest then my trust will shake, If self has wholly died, And in Thy likeness when I wake I shall be satisfied. Father, I may not bring Thee more, I cannot bring Thee less Than what Thou didst bestow before, To clothe my nakedness; And when my joys I reckon up On this brief earthly stage, Thou art the portion of my cup And all my heritage; And if I come as beggars lone Whom fortune rudely smites, Or give as kings upon their throne, I only give “two mites.” SERVUS SERVORUM. Lord, not large is my petition, Though it gathers in its plea Like the fulness of the sea All the poor of each condition; This is what I humbly crave, Just to be the servants' slave, And to carry comfort human To the pinched and pallid woman, Grinding out her love and life, And the sweetness of this mortal For the darkness of death's portal, In the factory's iron strife, But to swell accursed store; This I ask and nothing more. Lord, I do not beg for money, But the treasure of the toil Which wipes out the sinful soil, Nor for pleasure's acrid honey; I would be the carpet spread For the pauper's weary tread, And his mean and muddy scraper, Or the lonely widow's taper Which might give some solace meet; If with tears and bitter sorrow That they cannot have a morrow, Just to wash the beggars' feet, Fallen outcast at the door; This I ask and nothing more. Lord, I fain would raise the drudges, In the greedy mill and mine, Where the sullen hours they pine, Now to be themselves the judges; I for spinners lost and lone Would be just the stepping stone From the shameful rule of shoddy, With my crushed and bleeding body, Till they reach the sunny ridge; I would choose no higher station Than the dust of the foundation, For some future golden bridge Which will bear the suffering o'er; This I ask and nothing more. Lord, I do not pray for living With its gauds of rank or wealth, But to scatter hope and health In the royalty of giving; I am burning with a fire, To redeem from prison mire Wretches who could not be sadder, And to be myself the ladder Which uplifts them where they lie, And their gaping wounds to cherish, Though in serving them I perish, If a hundred times I die And damnation be my score; This I ask and nothing more. THE SKY PILOT. “Sic itur ad astra.” Fair weather pilot none is he, But (far as mortals go), He boldly launches out to sea, Whatever winds may blow; However billows leap and fret, They only bid him pray, They cannot shake his course, and yet He works his onward way; Round iron reefs and stormy capes, By fierce and foaming bars, Steadfast he steers his craft, and shapes His voyage for the stars. But frolic boats on idle whims Are flitting up and down, And heed not as it upward swims The corpse's threatening frown; Deep in the gulf of ocean caves They flicker to and fro, Or hang on crests of curling waves (Like butterflies), and go; They seem so gallant, while they graze The flowery shoals in flight, And dancing drop through purple haze To pleasure and the night. Though perils come he knows not when, And terrors o'er him rise, He carries home the souls of men, A costly merchandise; The souls of men are passing sweet, And thus he cannot stay, Who lays them at the Master's feet, For all his holiday; O earth is a poor fleeting jest, And wordly joy but jars On him who toils for other's rest, And steereth for the stars. By Scylla and Charybdis bent, He pushes on his track, As braver ships before him went That never did come back; He coasts the Siren's pleasant lands, With all their tempting store, Nor heeds the white and waving hands Upon the shining shore; And if a soul too idly sleeps, The waters cannot whelm The pilot at his post, who keeps His hold upon the helm. His compass is the faith, that burns Clear in the deepest night, And from each dazzling meteor turns Up to the heavenly light; His chart is not in human books, Nor marked by earthly times, But (writ with God's own finger) looks To fairer farther climes; No dying beacon guides the road, It only mocks and mars By tricking out his bitter load, He steereth by the stars. About him drift the ghastly forms Of vessels wrecked and reft, Dismasted by the deadly storms And lone and helpless left; They wallow in the tumbling waves, Which once they gaily trod, And lift as out of blasted graves Their broken arms to God; Tost up and down with every tide, While evils hourly grow, They reel and shudder, and abide The last black plunge below. Strange currents in this ocean run, And unmapped foemen fall, And in a midnight sky the sun Hears drowning sinners call; The darkness with the daylight strives, And gates of wondrous goals Look dimly down on precious lives Of beautiful sweet souls: But still the pilot homeward leads His freight, through noble scars, With upward gaze as one who reads God's story in the stars. The lightning flashes, rocks their fangs Unfold to pierce his bark, Above his head the tempest hangs, A horror dense and dark; The thunder rolls, and dreadful sounds The surge beneath him sends, And breakers grim as hungry hounds Pursue him to the end; He wavers not, his heart is true, And points from passion short To the far opening rift of blue, And presses on to port. “COMPLETE IN HIM.” One left us for he was but lent A little while, and might not stay; The Master called him, and he went Into eternal day. One lies not in his native dust, But under ocean deep and dim; And we must hush our hearts, and trust The Lord had need of him. Another now is gone, this time To life, along the Master's track; But going caught the heavenly chime And gave its music back. And yet she is not gone, but still Holds tight the bond she ever bore, And shares the place she used to fill With one who makes it more. She brought a brother back like light To those who loved and lost so long, And changed the sorrow of our night Into a marriage song. And last is Christ, though not the least, To turn earth's water into wine— To make life all one wedding feast; And so we still are nine. CREDO. Fenced by my little study walls I daily toil and spin, And hear from far like trumpet calls the struggle and the sin, The joy and sorrow of the morrow from which my threads of life I borrow, And death that is akin. While, by my faith, of mingled glooms and glories do I raise New towers with marble steps and rooms of builded prayer and praise; Grand images of palaces, and graces beyond Guido With all his fairest fantasies, start from a simple credo. The thought that wedded is to will, For ever making much with its creative touch, Brings worlds of being into seeing And ransomed out of wrong and ill. I formed my heaven, I formed my hell, And both have lightly trod, And in its mighty crucible I shaped myself and God. Securely from my citadel I see the battle rage Around, and as a sentinel stand on a higher stage; The world's great story and the glory to earth's most distant promontory, Seem all my heritage. I make, I mar whate'er is good—the realms that proudly rise, The miracle of womanhood, the purple in the skies; The green water, the gossamer, the sword blade from Toledo, The web of the philosopher, spring radiant from my credo. The tossing wave, the troubled wind, The passion and the pain so often sweet and vain, The soul of sadness hid in gladness, I freely loose, I freely bind. I wrought the hell, I wrought the heaven, And ready at my nod Compelled by faith's creative leaven, Emerges man or God. THE GOD NURSE. He laid me on my mother's breast—the likest to His Love, And feathered all my little nest from His own Peace above. He taught me at my mother's knee the holy things and good, To make me beautiful and free He steadfast round me stood. He took me from my mother's side, and through this desert land Led by the gracious living tide with gentlest Father hand. He held me in His tender arms, if rougher grew the road, And shielded me from mortal harms or shared the heavy load. He cleansed me from the shameful sin, He tempered every fear To every weakness, just to win one loyal smile or tear. He carried all my cares and grief and with my sickness ailed, He found His rest in my relief and at no sorrow failed. By my affliction He was torn and felt the fatal dart, The daily need or tiny thorn stabbed first His faithful Heart. For He was mingled with my woes and measured by my chain, My enemies were too His foes and His the bitter pain. Whatever blast of want has blown or shadow fallen on life, He made its every pulse His own and blunted the keen knife. For me He bore the iron breath of stormy wind and wave, He died for me the cruel death and slept within my grave. But what have I repaid in turn for this most constant Love, I who so long refused to learn one lesson from above? He wept with me when sadness came who taught the nobler choice, And as I rose from trial's flame with me He did rejoice. But for His wise and watchful heed what service have I wrought, In all my grovelling selfish greed, yet hourly saved and sought? Ah, though He washes yet my feet and shelters me from ill, I weave Him but a winding-sheet and crucify Him still. DRAW IT UP. The ocean of life is around thee, my brother, But yet thou abidest in need And dost give to salvation no heed; Though the wealth is beside thee, there is not another; Draw it up, draw it up, Bring thy heart as a cup! Thou art dying of thirst, when the heavenly water Bubbles up at thy ignorant feet And the seeking and solace might meet; Why not drink of the fountain, that flows not in slaughter? Draw it up, draw it up, Bring thy love as a cup! Thou art pining in plenty, a toiler for nothing, But seest not light though at hand, In the port of a neighbourly land, And the food that is better than riches or clothing; Draw it up, draw it up, Bring thy faith as a cup! The ocean of life is around thee, poor strayer, And thou art a wanderer still Who hast chosen the poison and ill, When thy lacking calls loudly for penitent prayer; Draw it up, draw it up, Bring thy life as a cup! AFTERMATH. Sunshine and shadow have played on the field, Drought and the falling of dew Blessed it and broke and made it anew;— What is thy yield? Pain with its arrow and grief with its harrow Troubled it turning each part, Rooted up bristles of obstinate thistles Trying the depths of its heart; Laid very low all the pride of the heap, Letting in beams of the morn; What has the Master, who looks not for thorn, Left Him to reap? Comforts have curtained thee round with their glow Sheltered from storm and the blight, Raised thy poor weakness and led it to light;— What didst thou sow? Ploughing has humbled the clods that it crumbled Surely with searching of care, Sorrow with riving has killed the surviving Weeds that escaped from the share; Where is the glory of fruits, that should leap Ripe from the bosom of earth? What shall the Master, who seeks not for dearth, Find Him to reap? Mercy was thine and by merit not won Guiding thy steps through the year, Lavish with plenty that shielded from fear;— What hast thou done? O when thou carvest good cheer from the harvest Piling up gold in the sheaves, Bountiful measure for thee and thy pleasure— Whose are the pitiful leaves? Why dost thou offer the blemished and cheap, Refuse that man would but spurn? What can the Master, who asks some return, Reckon to reap? Heaven has open its windows and rained Blessings on thee and thy store, Riches of meetness and beauty and more;— What hast thou gained? Think of the chances that bright with their glances Summoned thee sweetly to toil, Mystical meanings and wonderful gleanings Hid in the promising soil; Full was thy fortune and never at neap, Bringing thee honour and all; What for the Master, who comes with His call, Lingers to reap? SECTION V. Matin Bells. MATIN BELLS. Matin bells, sweet matin bells, With their early daily song Poured as out of sacred wells And in rhythmic swoons and swells, Ding, ding, dong! Softly falling, gravely calling Souls to penitence and praise; As if flying angels crying Did to God Himself upraise Words like flowers, dropt in showers On a shadowed world of wrong— Ding, ding, dong! Oft betwixt the will and deed, As I dally in the throng With a thought of sinful seed, They recall the golden creed— Ding, ding, dong! Loudly pealing and revealing To my love the better way, And from chidden fruits forbidden, Rousing me to watch and pray; Till bad savours lose their favours, And no journey can seem long— Ding, ding, dong! When beneath my load I sink Or the scourge with cruel thong, As I totter on the brink Of despair, they fetch me drink— Ding, ding, dong! Telling lowly truths and holy To uplift me as I bend, Till the burden is the guerdon Which supports me to the end; They are nigher me and higher, Than the earth's gay pleasure gong— Ding, ding, dong! Matin bells, dear matin bells, With their early daily song, Leading me where duty dwells And delight has holy spells— Ding, ding, dong! They are keeping notes unsleeping As I daily play my part, With their glory's echoed story Through the chambers of my heart; While to living freely giving Balm, that makes the spirit strong— Ding, ding, dong! THE GRAND OLD CHURCH. Come rally round our glorious ark, All ye on service bent, And shield through tempest and the dark Our old Establishment. For centuries of power and pride, The pillared Church and State Have braved together side by side A hundred storms of fate. And slanders all shall vainly smirch The bulwarks Christ has wrought— The dear old Church, the grand old Church For which our fathers fought. The guardian of the weak and poor She holds our charter deeds, And never from her open door Turned one who carried needs. Her voice has like a trumpet pealed Down ages dim and long, And daylight to the lost revealed That sorrow changed to song. The flames of trial did but search (That made a bridal bed), The dear old Church, the grand old Church For which our fathers bled. Great dynasties have come and gone, And earthly systems set, The sun of all but brighter shone And shall be brighter yet. She is builded on the Living Rock And not on shifting sand, And shall outlive the fiery shock When melts the solid land. Lies topple from their golden perch, Not truth that God has stayed— The dear old Church, the grand old Church For which our fathers prayed. Then rally round our hoary shrine, The Priest and Sacrament, Whose grace is naught if not divine, The old Establishment. She guards the lamp of holy oil, That makes a nation live; With peace she blesses every toil, Which she alone can give. The blast, that laid the silver birch, The great oak hardly tried— The dear old Church, the grand old Church For which our fathers died. A CHRISTOPHANY.—I. I had a dream, a solemn dream That bade me hold a tryst Down by a dark and rolling stream, With the dear blesséd Christ. I saw a Hand, a piercèd Hand, Which called me from this pleasant land And every idle whim, The scarlet flowers And happy bowers, And beckoned me to Him— Unto a tryst, a holy tryst With my fair Master, the sweet Christ. It came at night, one awful night Stabbed by the levin's dart; And yet a marvellous great Light, Broke from a bleeding Heart. I saw His eyes, His loving eyes More soft than sun in summer skies— More beautiful than day With holy tears That washed my fears, And made me kneel and pray; Till in that Heart, that bleeding Heart, I found myself, my better part. It was no dream, no passing dream, It was no fancied tryst; And life was that gray tossing stream, Which carried me to Christ. I saw His feet, His piercèd feet On cutting stone, in cruel street, Wherein He had no lot; For labour's pen And striving men— Alas, they knew him not. Though toil and tryst, each noble tryst, Drew virtue from the wounds of Christ. I bent my brow, my rebel brow, And struck this guilty breast; And to my lips a sudden vow Rushed, with a sacred rest. I heard His voice, His healing voice, That mixed with my own settled choice; And on my drooping head He bade me bear The cross of care, Which He had borne instead. And on His breast, His heavenly breast, I found the very thorns were rest. And now I keep, I daily keep Beneath the Cross a tryst, And in the visions of my sleep I suffer still with Christ. I know His face, His wondrous face Is all my glory, all my grace, If life be sometimes dim; And, when I ail Some tender nail Will marry me to Him. And so a tryst, a lover's tryst Is what I only ask of Christ. A CHRISTOPHANY.—II. Offspring of sadness, astray on the street, Tost as in madness with bruisèd brown feet, Cometh a ranger of alleys and slums Suckled on danger and starved with our crumbs; Wizened and tattered and harshly by mire Spotted and spattered and flecked as with fire, Bearing a burden of refuse and crusts Left as the guerdon of drains and the dust; Crushed, with no portion of pleasure or taste, Cast an abortion on misery's waste:— Who is this, Holy One? Speak to my heart; Who is this lowly thing, lost and apart? Sudden the shadows of time roll away, As from the meadows the mists that delay Struck by the arrows of sunlight, and woe Tells how it harrows the poor with its throe; Child he no longer appears, and the brow Brightens and stronger his bearing is now; Ah, and the bitter mean load on his back, Sends a strange glitter through ruin and wrack; Holy the fashion, and cruel the loss; Here is the Passion, for here is the Cross. Yes I see, Holy One, under the pain Unto this lowly lot Christ nailed again. Food for the gallows, he slinks to his cell Wrecked on the shallows that lead us to hell, Hopeless, a spoiler of men, with no brand Borne by the toiler and ruddy of hand; Brutal in features and gloomy in mind, Shaped as the creatures that prey on their kind, Sinister, scenting the blood from afar; Grim, unrelenting, with many a scar Scorching the traces of anger and lust, Pestilent places and all the unjust. Who is this, Living One, evil and dim? Is there forgiving yet treasured for him? Lo, as I ponder this problem of night, If for such yonder there yet may be light, Somehow and somewhere, and happier lot Ever can come where the heart is one blot; Into the prison, which frowns as if hope Could not have risen or found there a scope, Shineth a splendour but not of our skies Making it tender and pure those dark eyes, Turning to golden delight the sere dross Till with its olden sad tale stands the Cross. Yes, I see, Living One, in that vile flesh Christ the forgiving is murdered afresh. Tramping the pavement, a blight on the flags, Gilded enslavement with virtue in rags, In the surrender that loses the whole Paid by the vender of body and soul; Dizened and nameless, the daughter of sin Strolls along shameless with impudent chin, Wanton, a scorner of honester trade, Now at a corner and now in the shade Flaunting the jewel as false as her speech, Greedy and cruel, athirst as a leech. Who is this, Blessèd One, yet in the bud, Basely caressèd and cheap as the mud. Over the tricking of powder and stains, Horribly sticking like leperous blains, Over the sneering of folly and vice Spread as veneering and bought at a price, Surges a glory and shimmers a grace Read not in story of earth's highest place; Tenderly soften those features through paint Saddened, as often the eyes of a saint Through the wild welter of temptings that toss To the one shelter, revealing the Cross. Now I see, Blessèd One, from the black mire Christ has caressèd this form as with fire. THE NEW MAGDALEN. Christ came, as often He makes His theophany, Came in the street— Came as a Lonely One, came as the Only One, Naked of feet; Robed but in tatterings spotted with spatterings Cast by the mire. Clouts, as in merriment shaping a cerement, Veiled not His fire Breathing sweet awfulness on the unlawfulness Bursting its bound, On the iniquity and the obliquity Surging around; Till all the blindnesses seeking for kindnesses But without rest, All dumb maternities in dark eternities, Hid in His breast; All the sad billowings hungry for pillowings Hailed in Him part, All the wild malices drunk with hell chalices Brake on His heart. Christ as a Pariah stood forth a barrier Meeting the foe, Hushing the harlotry, exiled by varletry Outcast in woe. Beggary, shameful dress, took an unblameful dress, Touched by His hand; Thirsting and neediness, lusting and greediness, Owned His command. And the unshriven lot sprang a forgiven lot Fair from His light, Born into blessedness from the caressedness Found in that sight. Christ as the Holy One, Christ as the Lowly One Bearing His Cross, Spake to me winning souls, sware of all sinning souls None should be loss. Tears for pain's harrowings, horrors and harrowings, Fell a sweet flood, Blotting out sentences barring repentances— Great tears of blood; Words for the wondering, words for the blundering Orphans adrift, Staggering on so late, deaf and disconsolate— Words to uplift. “Who is this brittle reed, who is this little reed Down in the dust, Withered and wearily bending and drearily Blown by each gust? Once she was dutiful, once she was beautiful, Bright as the morn; Now she goes toilingly, now she goes soilingly, Branded with scorn. No one may name her more, no one can shame her more, Blighted in brow; Marked for indignity, shunned by benignity, Look at her now! Victim of vanity, dead to humanity, Drowning in drink— Type of the terrible refuge inerrable, Over the brink; Under the shimmering stars and the glimmering Gas-litten gloom! Fear, though sin's sediment is no impediment Now to her doom; Draggled and wandering, troubled and pondering What will be next, Past any miracle, hopeless, hysterical, Misery's text! Yet in her flightiness girt by Almightiness' Infinite care, Yet from obscurity meant in a purity Richer to share. Who is this little reed, who is this brittle reed Bending so low? Who is this rumpled thing, who is this crumpled thing Halting and slow? Tell me of sadnesses, tell me of madnesses, Then you can guess Who is this blighted one, who this unrighted one Dumb with distress? I'm not contemning her, I'm not condemning her, Others may grudge Least crumb of feelingness for mute appealingness; Who is her judge? Wicked I call her not, erring I thrall her not With the old bond; Past the sour Pharisee, over her heresy Light leaps beyond. All I can see in her, all soon to flee in her Is passing night, Trespassing, sorrowful, quenched by the morrow full Of visions bright; Only the meeknesses, only the weaknesses Bidding her stray, Turned into sweetnesses of my completenesses In the new day. I lift a stone for her, I who atone for her, I fix a brand! I would set throne for her, if all alone for her, Proud by her stand. Love sees the beautiful mating the dutiful In a true tryst, Love sees divinity and new virginity Reborn in Christ. Love sees no sin in her, love sees begin in her Innocence quite, Love sees a glorious lot and victorious Loveliness white. Where is the Stoical spirit heroical, Raising her up! Where is the womanly hand, giving humanly Her the love cup? Not mere mortality hers, but reality No man hath priced; Out of her viciousness comes all deliciousness; She is the Christ.” THE PILGRIM. I walk in the strength of weakness That clings to the Holy Rood, In the pride of the Master meekness Of the gentle Brotherhood; Who the awful sign have carried And the lamp of living oil, And with blood and fire were married To the consecrated toil; Who have bowed with others' burden And been scourged with others' rod, But asked for no fairer guerdon Than to suffer alone with God. I walk in the dark by vision From the Light that cannot lie, With the sword of the one decision That has cut each earthly tie; For the saints are my sweet assessors As I go on my pilgrim path, In the faith of the old confessors Who have trodden the road of wrath; And the flint, where my footstep lingers, Makes me feel with velvet shod, And the thorns are but friendly fingers That beckon me home to God. I walk in the might of martyrs Who are near when I travail most, In the name of the churches' charters That are more than an armèd host; And I rest, when my heart is weary, On the Rock of no mortal plan, And I count no service dreary That is done for a brother man. And the flame is a blessèd beacon, As the Cross on the graveyard sod, If a fear for a moment weaken My hold on the Human God. I walk under skies of waving Palms, though the tempest frowns And the blasts of hell are raving, But I only see the crowns; And the Holy One I follow I mark in the beggar's rags, Though His hand weighs in its hollow The worlds and the iron crags; Not a thought may now be craven, If the mountains quake and nod, And I cannot miss my haven, For the Way itself is God. JUDAS ISCARIOT. I had a dream of marble palaces Bathed in blue skies, and broken images Of emperors and gods, discrowned, dethroned, And the great rule of iron and blood atoned By blood and iron at last and laid in dust, With all its pomp of consecrated lust And loves dissolved and liberties denied By venerable vices deified. And then I met Him, met the Master, strong In meekness that was might, amid a throng Of Galilæans clamouring to be led Against the Spoiler who with spacious tread Bestrode the earth at His unbounded will And drained it dry, and asked another still To torture in those convolutions vast, And leave when sucked an empty shell at last. Yes, grim and gaunt as famished hounds were they That smelled the blood and hungered for the prey, Snapping and snarling at His heels, and all (Who yet came greedy to be fed at call) At strife among themselves, in impotence Of blind ambition for pre-eminence; Good stuff for soldiers, panting to be led With large and loyal hearts, but with no head For calculation's calm and symphonies Of stately plots and measured strategies; Like bloodhounds straining in the leash, with tense And trembling muscles and one murderous sense Of the red tainted track they nosed and knew, And wild to wallow in the deathly dew With garments rolled in battle and in gore, While fierce their eyes stared steadfast on before. But I had brains, I nursed a patient heart And felt within me power to hold a part Not all unequal to the coming clash Of awful arms, when warring worlds would crash And better peace with fairer land and sky Would slow emerge from earth's great agony. He talked of kingdoms, too, and said a sword Would be His sceptre and He looked our Lord, From that pure brow which dominated each To the firm footstep with its royal reach That went straight forward to its certain end, Nor swerved one jot nor would one tittle bend From the appointed purpose. He was King, His voice had just the right imperial ring With all its woman's tenderness, and spoke As with authority and in us woke Strange feelings, higher thoughts, a grander state, And swept us onward like the march of fate. But He delayed, and dallied with the fire His words had lit and fanned to vast desire, Commensurate with Israel's regal scope And broad humanities of blessed hope. Affairs were ripe, the actors ready, time Had struck the hour with stern impatient chime For venture and for victory, and yet He lingered when the feast seemed almost set And in the hand the prize, the precious meed, For the great heart that grasped the present need And beat in tune. The Roman wolf lay drowsed With wine and wassail, and at ease caroused Although in harness, careless of the wave That hung and gathered and might be his grave. The legionaries, swollen with pride and lust, Contemptuous, marked no murmur of the gust Precursor of the storm, and threw in play The dice that nigh had thrown a world away. No fear from them, the mercenary spear That sold its favours only when paid dear And (were we masters, as we might have been) Had fought for us. The peril waxed unseen, A grisly menace; step by step it drew Nearer, and to a bodied blackness grew In sullen workshops, on the silent mount And desert shore, and at the shining fount Where maidens met and babbled; and from marts Went up the troubled sigh of bruiséd hearts, Amid the wrangling of the rogues and fools. Yes, out of Rabbis' dim and dusty schools, Arose a solemn rustling to the skies Of yellow parchments and phylacteries, Borne on the breath of prayer and pious hate That knocked for ever at Jehovah's gate. And even the royal harlot's perfumed bed, Where drugged with wanton dreams the golden head Lay lapt in pride, found in that purple blot Room for a hope that was one splendid spot And made sin well nigh beautiful. The feet Of laughing children down the sultry street, Mimicked in sport, that did most brightly feign, The expected hour when Israel yet should reign. And to and fro, with lustrous oval cheek, Intent on trade and talk the curious Greek With news a glittering shadow came and went, And higgled for a mite, and bowed and bent In supple grace. From stormy cape and crag, And parthian wastes, flashed out the danger flag For those who knew the tempest signs; the air Was thick with portents, up the starry stair Climbed new strange beacons, and the deepening gloom Heavy with thunder travailed as for doom. Lo, through the east an ominous whisper sped From land to land, the midnight skies were red With wrath and ruin, and a bloody blade Aloft was brandished in the shivering shade Above infatuate Rome; a rumour crept Through silken chambers, where the tyrant slept On rose-strewn couches, boding change and strife And fair beginnings of a larger life. But He was silent, He delayed, though still His words were firebrands, which He flung at will Among us, many a bright and burning phrase, To kindle hearts and set the world ablaze; Division ever was His thrilling theme, In house and home, and in the mightier scheme Of courts and councils, sire against the son, And friends against their friends that were as one, With treachery and treason every breath And parents hounding children to the death Or children parents. While the stars for Him Contended up in Heaven, though earth waxed dim, And kings went down, and dynasties were cast As autumn leaves and stubble on the blast, And out of chaos and the cosmic pall His own new kingdom mounting over all. And we, He said in words like thunder tones, Should rule with Him and sit on equal thrones And judge the nations with our sceptred hands Beneath the bluer skies, in greener lands, Baptised with blood that marked the era's close, While wildernesses blossomed as the rose. And I believed Him, I believe Him yet, Though now in darkness that dear Sun has set To soar again with broader brighter rays, And usher in the true heroic days. I thought to serve Him by one desperate deed, And make our holy faith the conquering creed Again, and bring again for David's shrine The human grandeur and the grace divine, With more than David's empire and a home For Israel vaster than the dreams of Rome. And so I played the traitor, I who meant Only to force His hand, and on Him leant And on His promise as on some tall tower, With no misgiving of His will or power; I would compel Him thus to make us free, And flash the sign to hungry Galilee, Expectant, hot with the Messiah's name, Like tinder quick to burst into a flame When fell the fatal spark, a word, a look, A gesture or a passage from the Book That metes our marching orders. I was sure Of His fixed purpose, and in Him secure. I never doubted He would then draw back Or turn a hair's breadth from the appointed track And predetermined goal, while putting by The investiture of all Eternity; I never dreamed when God Himself sent down His benediction and a heavenly crown In Jordan's flood and on the holy hill Of transformation, He would yet stand still And strike no worthy blow and give no sign When prophecies were ripe and hours benign. I never guessed His was no earthly reign, And all he said was darkly used to feign Another kingdom and another power Within us, when the heart itself would flower, Responding to the Spirit and hold sway In parable with Him some distant day. I thought the lightning now would be His sword, And angels flock in legions round their Lord From miracle to miracle, and none But He (as old deliverers had done) Would lead us forth to conquest and its palms, With rolling thunder of re-echoed psalms, And call down bolts from the blue firmament As awful seals of our enfranchisement. They thought me thief when I with patriot thrill Preferred my country and God's righteous will Revealed by prophets to the passing need Of poverty's just tolls, in higher heed, For holy wars and treasuries and aims Of statesmanship and kingdoms' broader claims, To build foundations for divinest dues And be the seed of royal revenues. Myself I never served, I scorned defence Of lofty acts and larger providence Beyond the flight of petty minds that drudged Their dreary mill-round, and from ruts misjudged In their dull progress that could only creep, My glorious visions and the imperial sweep Which bade me store my little, though in stealth, For our renewed and ransomed commonwealth. No pulse of gain, no dream of traitorous greed Moved me one moment to the daring deed So gravely planned, and all without offence; I thought the armies of Omnipotence, The hierarchies of the heavens and Space Would at his bidding in their bright embrace With Cherubim and Seraphim in hosts, Fall on the city and and its vantage posts, And seize the Temple and the towers and cast The tyrant out with one consuming blast. And then He yielded tamely, though His look So calm and kingly and unearthly shook His captors, cowed and grovelling to the dust In abject terror, like a whirlwind's gust; While valiant Peter drew his sword to slay And struck one blow in the old sturdy way For vengeance and for Israel's sake, and then A desperate front and more determined men Had roused the people to His rescue, fired With hate of years and by His love inspired. But, lo, He meekly stayed the storm, and sheathed The crimson blade of promise, as He breathed Words like a blessing that were bitter woes Upon the coward renegades and foes. So they forsook Him, all—even Peter fled And followed far, as if no blood were shed, But then denied Him thrice. I flew on wings Of hope and fear, with awful questionings, To spread the news and gather friends and speed The Galileans to their Captain's need. But sudden panic held those fiery hearts, Though still I urged all stratagems and arts And past forgiveness lied to make them move; They asked for angels, portents, signs to prove It was God's mission, and the destined time For action when the least delay was crime. And rose the barrier never to be crost, The precious hours passed by, and all was lost; While that false rabble, not content to fly And mock Messiah, now cried “Crucify!” I took the silver, which I won in craft To fill our coffers and to wing our shaft, And threw it down though in the Holy Place Before the priests, and cursed them to their face. And may Jehovah keep that curse for me, Till Christ returns and Israel yet is free; And may it rest on that poor dastard land Which for its Saviour would not lift a hand, And rot their life and poison all they do With blight, and as a cancer eat it through. I saw Him die, whose service was one death For us; I marked the torture of each breath So bravely borne, and heard those human lips Sob forth their love in the last dread eclipse And care for others, and that bitter cry Wrung from a broken heart in agony. But, in the ghostly shadow ere it fled, I, drawn still nearer by the light He shed From the red Cross which was His royal throne— A light that seemed to fall on me alone, In my black horror—caught His tender look, And read my pardon there as in the Book. He knew I stole and plotted but for Him, And every pulse beat true in every limb— For the great cause—He knew, who came to save As all hearts' King, and like a King forgave. But now I cannot live apart from Christ, And thus I go to keep a wedding-tryst (To show Him I am faithful to the end) With beautiful dear death, my only friend, If in His Paradise we yet may meet, Though I be dust beneath His blessèd feet. THE GREAT QUEST. “Beyond those peaks of purple,” some one said, “That seem to prop the palace of the heavens And meet and mix with them in loveliness Of hyacinthine light, the Vision dwells Through pillared porches opening into Life, Where truth and beauty mingle and are one In happiness and peace.” And I believed And journeyed on in uncompanioned haste A solitary soul, but still possest With purpose like a fire, and ecstasy Of hope that stept on roses as it trod In triumph, heedless of the toil and soil And buffetings of chance and change. I went Straight as an arrow from the bow and winged With passion, forward to the one fixed goal. No terror turned me, no dread circumstance Of danger stayed my feet that made the stones And thorns subservient to their pilgrimage; Though shadows as of death encompassed me And threatening shapes that melted ere I passed, While horror of deep night at times rushed down Superincumbent. Ever on I moved, Who only sought the beautiful and best. But as I drew yet nearer, lo, the tops That looked like summits of high virgin thought, White roses bathed in blue and heaven, sank down And dwindled into insignificance Of common colours and most humble mien, Which nought but distance and my purblind gaze Had fashioned forms magnificent. I took Them almost in my stride, and scarce Discerned as different from the valley or plain. No solemn Vision greeted me, no Voice Brake like a living fountain from their cup Of quietness; I heard the weary wind That wailed as it had wailed ten thousand years Among the rocks in their gray grim repose, The rugged sphinxes of the solitude; I saw no sight to gladden me, with peace Of riddles answered and old secrets solved; I caught no word of comfortableness, That spake of lofty hopes and dreams fulfilled In vast fruition of rich act and fact; And still that ancient singer babbled on, Just to itself. I wept and wondered now, Where lay the Truth, the Unattainable, Which yet I sought and wrought to overcome If at the supreme sacrifice of all That makes life worthy, health and wealth and life. Then as I wept and grovelled in the dust, Appeared a holy man with looks of love And light that wove a wonder round his head Hoary from time and measured pieties, With murmuring lips of praise and breast of rest, Who lifted up my fallen frame and mind, And said, “Believe in God and dwell with me Apart from men, and multiply sweet prayers And charities for suffering pilgrims here, Rejected by the world, and pour thy heart Out in a daily stream of constant toil And worship.” So I hearkened to his speech That dropt like dew upon a wilderness Upon my soul, and sojourned in his house, And mortified my flesh with fasts and nails Of crucifying penance, seeking what I thirsted for with many tears and fears. Whole nights I wrestled sore with monstrous foes, Obscene and sudden, which against me flocked, And brought with them all the artillery Of evil, if they might but everthrow The sanctity of my pure purpose. Lone I faced them on my knees with agonies Of supplication, meeting sword of pride With shield of purpose, and though wounded oft And bitterly I struggled toward some end, Faint, yet determined still. I scattered gold About me as I held my steadfast course Of ministering mercies, and I lay Myself in sackcloth on the dank hard stone, Which struck me with inevitable arms And bruised with frequent blows. But never came The rending veil, the clear theophany. I seemed as one who twisted ropes of sand, And builded castles in the clouds of air Or fancy; all my prayers and praises ran To foolishness as beads upon a string, Told in the twilight to the flickering shades By ghostly figures; while the cares and snares Of banished life peeped mockingly within My haunted cell and yet more haunted heart Still. Vainly did the chants devotional, The sacred rites and solemn mysteries, The service and the pageantry of cults And venerable creeds that bowed the form But not the spirit, hedge me round with bound Of holy bars and bolts innumerable, And talk to me in measures calm and soft Antiphonies and ardent undertones. That came not, which I sought by divers ways Of genuflection in the very soul, Which bent and bent not to observances And forced oblations not my own; I stood Outside it all, a mere spectator, touched But yet not taken by the almighty tide Of worship, that with whirl and swirl profound Caught other souls and flooded them with flame And secret music, till they overflowed In bright and burning love and walked with God And lived in utter disembodiment. I heard not, saw not, felt not aught except One awful Silence dark unknowable. I wandered forth once more, a haunted thing, A sole and separate waif, and lacked not guides Or councillors. They crawled on every hand, Loud, confident and multitudinous, Cheap as the dirt and common as the weeds Beneath my feet; they swarmed as vermin swarm In rubbish and the horrors of decay, Corrupt themselves, and so corrupting all With the dire taint of their infectiousness, Whate'er they handled. Each with remedies To heal the heart or the distempered brain And any ill, with much religiousness Or wondrous new moralities not taught By right or reason or the maddest church; Each rostrum had its nostrum for my case. Again I plunged into the moil of men And things, and drank the battle's fevered breath, Esteeming strife as life, and held my own Against tremendous odds, and rose and fell And rose once more Antœus from the earth, To smite the foeman down in dust and shame And gather splendid spots, in armoured ease Of resolution as on anvils wrought Red-hot to iron perfectedness of might; And from the pious palimpsests of use With all its organised hypocrisies And glittering masks of meretriciousness, I tore the veil and showed the naked springs And devilries at work, the engine-room, The reeking hell that was the human breast. One bade me live, another bade me die, And both with equal certitude of speech Assured. One told me work was everything, Rejuvenescence and the fount of joy; While yet another sware, that rest alone From toil and soil could bring me happiness And peace of soul. One knew the bliss required, The longed-for Vision and the Victory Lay all within the heart of man himself For introspection and the purged desire; Another knew the wells were all without In Nature communed-with and made a friend, And conquering paths of broad humanities In fellowship of love and labour. One Proclaimed the sole sufficiency of trust, Another preached pure excellence in deeds, And both alike with boundlessness of pride Boasted the secret of Omniscience. But in the teaching and the preaching, thrust Upon me by a thousand ready guides Or leaders who to nothing led but night, And could not lead themselves one little stage Along the road of life, I found no rest; But only counsels darkened, and despair Or shame of mind. Confusion spread around, It crept from bosom unto bosom thwart And threatening, and it coiled about the heart Circumvolutions serpentine and sad And chill. The rulers and authorities But feigned and reigned not over any realm, Excepting drear logomachies of dust. For all had different ways, and yet agreed In insolence and infertility Of thought that was mock thunder without bolt Or the red sword of lightning; optimists Sang hope and peace and fair enfranchisements At last somehow for every creature; some Rejoiced and revelled in the frank blank crash Of universal ruin, and a doom In final unimaginable woe Fixed; some, with besoms of gay theories, Surmised that they could sweep an ocean back Or on with strophe and antistrophe, Of laboured line and elegant conceit, And make the play and spectacle their own With splitting hairs and measurements of straws; Some in the present, some in the deep womb Of ages dim and distant, marked the rose That was redeeming dawn, new chastities And chivalries, the modes and codes of life's Last efflorescence, when the rude crude days Had passed; some sallied forth on wild crusades And raked the gutters, moral scavengers, Who drew from ugly sores unspeakable The decent veil, and gloated over heaps Of hateful refuse and the leprosies That bred in brothels; some ran over still With babblement of many words and cures, And went and came in empty rivalries Backward and forward up and down the streets And market-places, hawking petty trash Of medicines that were mockery and grief. And from the pulpit rose no certain sound But mumblings low and mouthings of false lips, The postures and impostures of the boards, The harlotries of art and masquerade That halted through its helpless mummery. So I perceived at length there was no bound, No Vision and no Voice of comforting Save in the passion of pursuit; the end Was nothing, and the way was everything; And in no idle refuge ultimate Lay Victory, but in the constant strife And agony and clash of hand with hand Or soul with soul. And thus I marked evolved The plenitudes of progress and the grace Of poesies, through gray catastrophes That sowed the seed of fresh vitality Betwixt the ribs of death. I saw the end Must be for ever unapproachable, And if an end existed all would stop When it was reached in equilibrium Of pale paralysis and dumb deep night And dark stark frost. No anchorage that held, Save for a moment when our battered ships Were moored against some new philosophy And gathered food to voyage farther on Into the awful Infinite, abode On this side of the mystery called life, Nor was desired. For but in ceaseless flux Of creeds and deeds and bright activities And energies, and impulses and shifts Of aims and claims with fresh horizons yet Expanding, could the faculties of man And blossomings of sweet moralities Be brought to birth and grow to grander heights, As purple mountains leap range beyond range To purple skies and marry heaven and earth. I proved the moment ethical sufficed, And that was all; to seize the effluence Of prayer or passion, the voluptuousness In woven arms when mouth kist mouth and breast Met breast, and all the body pulsed with fire, The white abandonment of ecstasy Immersed in depths devotional. No waste Of thought and feeling, or the aptitudes And jealousies of educated wit, That flashed among our delicate delights And fell in sadness or rose up in song, But always played about the paradise Of men, for ever lost, for ever found, If only in the humble flowers of earth. Thus have I learned—by the similitudes Of present nature and the apparent war Betwixt all creatures and all things that live, Which hardly hides the brotherhood below And fellowship of aim and unity Through sacrifice—thus have I dimly learned, There is no true theophany but this: The lesson by the way, the walk, the talk, The rapture of resistance overcome, The fight of might, the plenitudes of hope, The revelation of the heart to heart By loss and cross and torn tumultuousness Of appetites that surge and urge us on, To break like foam on iron and dreadful rocks Of righteousness and rule immutable By a Divinity, I know not what, Above, around, within and everywhere Desired, and yet most undesirable By imperfections shrivelling at its touch. I simply feel that, whether wrong or right My plan and purposing, I shall go on As now somewhither and somehow to some Uncertain issue not finality, Taught and untaught by trifles and the vast Outgoings of the ages; till I gain, If I do gain, a seeming strength at length To be myself and not another, nerved For either fortune, to endure, enjoy Whatever comes or seems to come to me From inner founts or the environment Of shining shapes that fluctuate and are But shadows. And content in uncontent Of resignation is my will and skill Whereby to steer my storm-tost impotence Unto the haven not of happiness, But knowledge tempered to the passing hour, And re-adjusted, as I step through gloom Or glimmer of a ghostly photosphere All undefined and undefinable. But still I seek and seek—because I must, And choose, as being the slave of circumstance No less than lord—the Vision that eludes My utmost efforts and for ever flies Before me in new latitudes of thought And unconjecturable fantasies Where night is day, and no beginning is And never bounding wall, and day is night, The end no end, the Unattainable. THE BOOK OF PRIVATE PRAISE. I thank Thee, sweetest Lord, that I Am wonderfully made, Although Thou art so very high And we do quickly fade; That I was greatly clothed by Thee Within this fearful dress, A Body beautiful to see— Fair in its fallenness. I thank Thee for these god-like Eyes Which wander through all Space, And entertain the land and skies In their small dwelling-place; And yet behold the tiniest thing Which has a moment's gleam, The dust upon the insect's wing, The dewdrop in the beam. I thank Thee for this awful Ear Which could not ever hark, If Thou was not Divinely near Interpreting the dark, And giving silences a sound Of fellowship, to greet Deaf pilgrims on earth's holy ground Which echoes back Thy feet. I thank Thee for this wondrous Mouth, That takes the print of prayer, And carries forth from north to south Sweet music as Thy sayer; A portal for Thy praises fit And filled by these alone, And where Thou dost delight to sit As on a kingly throne. I thank Thee for this cunning Hand A masterpiece of skill, Which moulds a cherry stone or land Alike to its great will; And wields the sword that fashions men To yet Diviner things, And conquers earth with plough and pen Or harps on golden strings. I thank Thee for these willing Feet That bear the temple up, Which Thy pure presence makes so meet And sacred where to sup; That more than with colossus stride Do bridge the boundless globe, And feel on every shore and tide The flashing of Thy robe. I thank Thee for this royal Mind Which rises in each fall, And looks before and looks behind Serenely weighing all; Which metes its purple to the mount— Its passion to the sky, And drinks for ever from the fount Of Thy eternity. I thank Thee for this little Heart, Which needs Thy constant fire To keep it holy and apart With virginal desire; Which, though so often shut in shade, For nothing mean was meant, And is of every creature made Thy favourite instrument. I thank Thee for this iron Will, A ray of Godhead's dower, Which freely chooses good from ill, And breathes almighty power; Which is the master of its fate, No toy of idle wrath, And loves to lay its sovereign state A carpet for Thy path. RIPENING. My soul is ripening in the shell Wherein it must a season dwell, Ere it can voyage free; When shall it break this narrow husk, And fly from discords and the dusk On happy wings to Thee? It frets a little but in love, For visions drawing me above The mire where pilgrims plod; And thrills with the inflowing sap To drop when mellow in Thy lap, O beautiful sweet God. Outside the petty stir and strife It feels the pulse of larger life, And the great grinding wheels, That measure throughout Time and Space For every creature its one place— And quickens as it feels. It gathers to its kernel all The graces of each blessèd fall By which we upward rise, And through the thwarting bolt and bar It smells in fragrance from afar The flowers of Paradise. It daily grows more fat and fair, And hungers for its native air Above this little bound; While awful powers with range profuse Within it form, and were abuse But for the holy ground. For here a tiny bud is seen And there a shoot of living green That trembles into fire, And from the very sin and soil Of conflict and the endless toil It fashions its desire. No heavy cross, no thorns in bliss That change to blossom come amiss, Or stay its soaring trust; It finds in each affliction sent Some glad and gracious nutriment, And turns to jewels dust. My soul grows riper every hour Alike in desert dearth and shower, From rapture and the rod; It stretches always through the night Away from earthly lures, to light And to its kindred God. When shall it burst from grave-like gloom Into its young rejoicing bloom, A golden butterfly; Whose bread is not the pavement stone, But the pure love of God alone— Whose home Eternity? THE LAUGHTER OF THE LORD. “He that sitteth in the Heavens shall laugh—the Lord.” We are going up or downward at a headlong heedless pace, And the Lord can only tell When He rings the judgment bell, What must be the final ending of this helter skelter race And the blind and brute contending for the spoils and gilded space— If it shall be heaven or hell. We are drifting with new teraphs to an unfamiliar shape, And it may be form of seraphs and it may be form of ape; As we ramble on and scramble In a most ungodly speed, Changing every day our creed, Hanging crowns upon the bramble And neglecting flower for weed; While we flirt and lie and gamble (But do little unless fee'd) For the loaves and for the fishes And the larger cups and dishes, Though in nothing else agreed; And with only our good wishes, For the fools who don't succeed. O we feast among the dying and we dance upon the dead, And with tears of orphans crying do we butter all our bread And the souls of women sighing are our silken dresses' thread; As we hurry on and scurry Through the welter and the worry, For the scarlet robes and honours Or the new antique Madonnas; While on breaking hearts and broken china heedlessly we tread, And the sneer is gaily spoken and the snare of falsehood spread By our rulers with each token of morality but dread; As with merry song and zither Which have lightly brought us hither We are hastening, none knows whither, From the darkness to its double and the riddle yet unread And the triumph or the trouble—though the Lord is overhead, Though the Lord is overhead. When the serpent Silence hisses and the tempest now is near, Between kissing and the kisses, between weeping and the tear, When the wise owl on the rafter Of the belfry holds his tongue, Where the iron throats are hung As he looks before and after— Then I seem between the moonrise and the moon at times to hear When the night is at its noonrise, like faint thunder in my ear, Far away the awful Laughter Of the laughing of the Lord, As he whets His judgment sword Ere He rides on high abroad, Thronèd on the winds His chariot In the clouds above Him solemn, Like a white cathedral column And the clouds beneath that cling, With his doom for each Iscariot Who is traitor to his King. In the pauses of the battle, in the respite of the lost, When the death-bolts do not rattle on the breastplates torn and tost With the buffets of the victors, ere the flaming doors are slammed By the mute infernal lictors on the wretches doomed and damned; In the lull between the shadow and the glinting of the shine When the grasses of the meadow have the ruddy look of wine, While the passion of the praying is not bodied forth in prayer And the hand that would be slaying has not fallen as a slayer, As the maiden with relenting of ripe lips and heaving breast Will not yield the full consenting to the feared and longed-for rest; In the sweet and sudden capture of the moment ethical And the sacred secret rapture under fast and funeral, In all interludes and breathing-spaces of the day and night, Ere the thought has found its wreathing word or deed has leapt to light; O I hear before and after Every intertwined repose, As eternities unclose, The divine and dreadful Laughter Of the laughing of the Lord, As if on the sky's blue rafter It recoiled and re-arose At the laughing of the Lord; O I hear beyond the leasing of our utmost life in joy, And in sadness never-ceasing round all time as though a toy, Inextinguishable numbers long and slow and soft and sweet Mingled as with fires and slumbers and the snow's white wingèd feet, In a musical emotion beyond melody and still With a calling to devotion of an awful iron Will, An infinity of throbbings as upon a thousand chords Out of love's impassioned sobbings and the muffled clash of swords, In unutterable pity and unutterable power Dew to toilers of the city and to blighted hopes a flower, But most terrible and holy in the murmur of the marts, With a lifting for the lowly and a healing to sore hearts. Rolling down the endless ages, and for all with tender pleas Through the sternest of the stages like the wash of far-off seas. We are always upward going To the stars, or storming back Down to the forbidden track; While we hurry on in flurry, And but little care or know, With the gnawing tooth of worry, Save that yet we forward go To new issues and new tissues, Which for ever form and flow, In our polities and flesh And the makings and the breakings As we rise and fall afresh. And it may be that the finding in our learning and our schools Still is nothing but the binding of the sacrificial cord To the altar and the axes that are sharpening for the fools, At the taking of His taxes by the judgment of the Lord; And the pearls of splendid fancies that deceive the deaf and blind Are the froth of false romances from a dark distempered mind, And a curse is on the heaping of the wise or wealthy hoard Which will crumble at the reaping of the judgment of the Lord. When I see the sin and folly And the crowned and conquering fault, But the Christ hid in the holly, And the feasting like a vault— When I see the sin and folly, Then I wonder that in thunder Flashes not the final “Halt!” And between the lavish courses of fair women and red wine, The delights of Heaven and horses and the swilling as of swine, And the garbage of divorces and the crowding of the shrine, In the little hesitations for the penance or the lust And the dainty calculations where the trimmings vie with trust Or artistic expectations from the ethics of the dust; Lo, upon the painted rafter I perceive the hanging sword And the sentence that comes after and reverses our award, And I hear the awful Laughter of the laughing of the Lord. THE LOVE OF GOD. Between daylight and the dawning under twilight's tender awning Came a vision bright to me, With its treasures offered me— Came an Angel with a message, came an angel with the presage Of the better things to be And the fairer sights to see, Looked in sadness on my errors, smiled away my foolish terrors; As a mother watching kindly o'er her baby straying blindly Takes it safely on her knee, So the Angel lifted me From the turmoil and the dreary toil that left me wan and weary High above the wicked welter of the evil to the shelter Of the many-fruited tree, With its happy healing branches and the only balm that staunches Earthly wounds and human weakness of the souls that turn in meekness To its shadow full and free, And the shine that cannot flee. And he said, “O timid mortal, why outside the open portal Homeless, helpless dost thou linger, knocking with a doubtful finger, When these blessings are for thee, In their riches all for thee— When God's love, a boundless ocean, answering the least devotion, Rolls around and for no fee? Lay aside thy sinful burden and accept the holy guerdon Which He gives and only He. Lo, without the gate are knolling death-bells and the billows tolling Pitiless, and on thy lee Hungry rocks of cruel iron frown forbidding and environ Those delicious sunny gardens where the temptress reigns and hardens With distress, as none but she— Beautiful and false is she. But within the pearly porches, where no heat of summer scorches And no icy shaft of winter's angry rain or snowflake splinters On the pilgrims tired and trembling and in loneliness dissembling Vainly with heroic features sadness of poor hunted creatures, Falling silent two and three— Walk the blessed ones, and we Know the truth behind the curtain of the sense and its uncertain Avenues that have no ending but the grave and keep descending, And behold the Vision (shrouded here) in all its bliss unclouded Bathing in the boundless ocean of the love beyond emotion, Where with all do all agree; And these treasures are for thee; Enter in and drink the juices dropping from their sacred sluices, Shed as if alone for thee.” So I passed the gracious portal, and in taking food immortal, Drank eternity through me. “PRAISE-GOD-BAREBONES.” I. I'll praise the Lord with any man, I'll praise the Lord with none, For life is but a little span And little have I done; But when I sing I feel a king Upon a royal seat, And then I rise Above the skies And dine on royal meat; For then I am a heavenly harp in spite of all my spare bones, Although the godless rabble carp and call me “Praise-God-Barebones.” Come, sinners, send your praises up And with a goodly shout, To give the Lord a brimming cup And starve the devil out; For Satan flees From bended knees And from the holy strain, And when the sound Of praise goes round His worst assaults are vain; I am the Master's chosen voice in spite of all my spare bones, Although the world may still rejoice and call me “Praise-God-Barebones.” I'll praise the Lord with lusty breath, He's worthy to adore, I'll magnify Him to the death Through life and evermore; Howe'er the fools Of scornful schools Deride the hymns I raise, If I am lean There's nothing mean About my swelling praise; I'm builded on the blessed Rock in spite of all my spare bones, Although the wicked people mock and call me “Praise-God-Barebones.” Come, fellow worms, who war with sin, Lift your thanksgivings well And make the house of song, wherein The Lord delights to dwell; I am but clay Who sing away To quench my mortal thirst, And this poor heart With just one part Must ever sing or burst; I've sung the guilty burden off in spite of all my spare bones, Although the adversaries scoff and call me “Praise-God-Barebones.” I'll praise the Lord through every change With loyal word and deed, His glory through the realms I range Shall be my only creed; Though darkly pent His instrument I lie within His hand, A rugged lute Awake or mute To carry His command; But large and lovely is my end in spite of all my spare bones, Although fat bulls of Bashan rend and call me “Praise-God-Barebones.” PRAISE-GOD-BAREBONES. II. I have praised the Lord in every place, From pavement to the pillory, When rotten eggs wrote on my face The devil's rude artillery; They cropt my ears, till iron tears Filled eyes that were unwilling, The cruel stocks and sturdy locks Have done their best at killing. No wonder flesh and fat avoid a spectacle of spare bones, And my leanness is so unalloyed it makes me “Praise-God-Barebones.” I have praised the Lord at every time In darkness and imprisonment, And sunk like Jeremy in slime With rags for my bedizenment; I have bearded priests and other beasts And faced the very lion, Despite the rack and daily lack To serve my God in Sion; I never found the time to feed my miserable spare bones, And grew no stouter on the creed that left me “Praise-God-Barebones.” I have praised the Lord in every way In town and desert dreariness, When hands were lifted up to slay And life was utter weariness; I have wrestled long in sacred song With gilded vice and varlet, And thundered truth to titled youth Or Jezebels in scarlet; And though they mocked my meagre flesh and counted all my spare bones, My soul within was plump and fresh while I was “Praise-God-Barebones.” I have praised the Lord with every part And in the teeth of devilry, With lungs and lips and valiant heart And raised a solemn revelry; I have gladly starved when beggars carved Rich capons for their dinner, And gathering foods from pious moods Yet holier waxed and thinner; The winter cold and summer heat made havoc with my spare bones, I little cared to drink or eat if ever “Praise-God-Barebones.” THE PALACE OF PRAISE. III. Sat in his spare bones Praise-God-Barebones Tuning his lusty pipe, Homely his vesture, humble his gesture, Richer his soul and ripe; Lean was his fleshy house, and yet freshly Touched with a heavenly ray, Shed by the glory where he sat hoary Praising his God alway; Ancient his rusty garments, and dusty Only from wrestling long— He single-handed, he with withstanded Evil and subject wrong; Sharpening the edge of song, Sharpening it merrily, sharpening it verily Keen on good forges, keen against orgies Licensed and stout and strong; Solemnly living but by thanksgiving Turned to a two-edged sword, Loudly and lonely praising and only Praising the blessèd Lord. Praise ye the Lord! Praise ye the Lord! Toiled in his spare bones Praise-God-Barebones Daily a drudge for truth, Worn to a skeleton only to tell it on, Giving his years of youth Bright as the morning, meat for the scorning Lust of a godless time, Draped like a cerement soiled from experiment Taught by the graveyard grime. Black was his raiment, mark of repayment Offered by evil man— Sign of his sorrows felt for the morrow's Doom and the judgment ban, After this earthly span, Sure for the sinners now though the winners— Badge of lamenting, shown by repenting Seeking an outward plan. Laboured he dimly onward and grimly, Heaping his pious hoard, Gauntly upraising palace of praising, Praising the blessèd Lord. Praise ye the Lord! Praise ye the Lord! SPECTACULA MUNDI. IV. I have praised the Lord with singing, I have praised the Master long, For the Sabbath bells kept ringing in my heart to evensong, While I waged a war with evils in high places and the shrine And the errors that like weevils sapt the core of things Divine. Ah, I hated graven images unto which poor dupes knelt down, And had many goodly scrimmages with the Scarlet Woman's gown Till I tore away the mummery that had hid the hateful lie And exposed the foolish flummery by which kings and peoples die; And beneath the mitre's jewel I laid bare the falsehood foul Like a crawling serpent cruel, and the satyr's monkish cowl Could not veil from me the leering eyes and fat voluptuous lips— Yea, I checked their proud careering when I smote with words like whips. Once I went for a black-letter cheat with round and rosy face, Who was but a snare and fetter with his hypocrite's grimace, To idolators and actors all deluded by the paint Which might mimic benefactors, but could never make a saint; He was done upon a panel, that looked like a tavern board, And esteemed a holy channel for the blessings of the Lord; For the votaries before him bowed and kissed his sinful feet, And they quarrelled to adore him in the temple and the street. So I girded me for battle, and I chose me goodly stones Which were sharp for Romish cattle and the idols set on thrones, While the spirit on my spare bones breathed the victory of trust, And I fearless Praise-God-Barebones ground the bauble into dust. I break the coloured windows with their harlotries or hue, And the Papists looked like Hindoos when I scourged them black and blue; For I had the zeal of Jael, and my hand was Jehu's sword, When he slew the priests of Baal for the honour of the Lord. And the Dagons from their niches, lo, I tumbled without heed Into fragments with their riches that had made their thousands bleed And ten thousand to perdition turned from pastures fair and green, With their solemn superstition the more dread because unseen. I defaced the tinsel wrappings, and in ruin wrote my name On the borrowed plumes and trappings which they flaunted to their shame; And I gloried in corrections, and with glee my missiles cast At their Romish resurrections, as God's own iconoclast. I have stabled my stout horses where His liegemen kept no troth With the Christ in loud divorces, and now worshipt Ashtaroth, In the fanes where gods were coffered and they bowed to scraps of bread And the sacrifice was offered and the heathen table spread. Then I trampled on the altars and the conjurors' vile tricks, While my beasts trailed loose their halters over shattered candlesticks And the incense lampand censer and the mockery of light Which left darkness only denser and proclaimed the heathen night. I defiled the idol vessels wherein wickedness was wrought, And had many righteous wrestles with the foes who vainly fought; For like iron were my spare bones, and as Samson burst the cords, And I was but Praise-God-Barebones, and the battle was the Lord's. There is scarce a fane in Merry England where my judgment mark Has not graved a witness very clear athwart each pagan ark, If it guarded not the living oracles of truth and God And the gravings were thanksgiving for the strength that by me trod. For my heart was sound and human and my heart was not my own, While I loathed the Scarlet Woman and the tares that she had sown In the wheat by her adultery and among our choicest fields With no niggard or desultory hand for bitter harvest yields. I was to my Maker married, and for him strove sternly on And with Him I spoiled and harried the fleshpots of Babylon; As in penance without pity I descended on the vice, And from country shades and city rose the solemn sacrifice. Ah, a pure and pleasant savour smelled the Lord when all the blood Of the foes who scorned His favour was shed in no stinted flood, While the Smithfield fires and faggots took in turn their carnival On the Roman moths and maggots who had held high festival. And I knew no paltry truckling for old principles and names, When I cast the babe and suckling with their parents to the flames, And I drowned their puling voices and compassion that would stay In the rapture that rejoices and the psalms that bid us slay. I was ever first to kindle the brave spark's avenging scourge, And to feed if it should dwindle the good bonfires that would purge; Though they also scorched my spare bones and whatever taint lurked in, But scotched never Praise-God-Barebones, who was spared to spare not sin. But I could not see the lighting of a candle or a cross, Without hands that itched for fighting and to purify the dross; And a missal or a relic or a musty-fusty bone Made my feelings un-angelic and my bosom hard as stone. Aye, a sculpture or the gilding of a Jezebel or shrine And the frescoes on a building that degraded the Divine, And the virgins that had nothing of the glory but the name With their poor pretence at clothing and a fig-leaf and their shame, And an aureole or nimbus round some never-living saint Or a daubing of some limbus fatuorum in red paint, All awoke in me a jealous passion for insulted God While they nerved my arm to zealous reckoning with torch or rod. O I was not one who tasted only wrath and then would cease, But I smashed the idols basted with their own hot candle grease And I brayed them into powder, as did Moses with the calf— While uplifting praises louder, for I did not ought by half— And I mixed it with the sweeping of the cloister and the sink, In a cup of woe and weeping for idolators to drink. And I burnt a holy feather from the wing of Gabriel With the priest and goose together, and I stood as sentinel; I was filled with righteous anger and consumed by pious wrath, At the lies and godless languor of the pilgrims on their path, When I fasted in my spare bones though they grew so fat and kicked At the fare of “Praise-God-Barebones” and their dainty dishes licked. If I suffered much, yet over all my perils in the end Did I triumph with Jehovah as my Captain and my Friend. For He shielded me and shattered by my arm that was His tool Enemies and ills, and scattered the proud scorners and the school Of the wisdom turned to water and the strength that proved but weak When the Lord arose to slaughter and in thunder came to speak. Then the mockers were as stubble, and the majesty of man Just a breath or passing bubble in His universal plan. Though behind the cart-tail haltered I was dragged and stoned and scourged, At my pangs I never faltered, if the wicked round me surged In a bloody sea of sorrow with the mire of sin they cast, For I knew the judgment morrow must be victory at last. I was but at best God's little mortal weapon, great in trust, To show earthly pomp was brittle and restrain the pride of lust. So He used me to His glory for a year or for a day On a service grim and gory when His vengeance had its way, Or to be His chosen trumpet of the Truth and gather home The poor outcast and the strumpet in His mercy's boundless dome. And if sometimes in divining His decrees I read amiss He would plunge me in refining furnaces or shame's abyss, Or on whetstones of affliction sharpen me to finer point And with trouble's benediction my unworthy head anoint, And yet humble more my spare bones or a season lay aside To lift higher “Praise-God-Barebones” though blasphemers should deride. I had holy recreation still as one of the elect When we talked Predestination, but as man to man erect, With the sword and with the battle and the arguments of steel And the iron rain and rattle which all heretics could feel. Though I liked a godly sermon with a loud and lusty roll When the text like dew of Hermon came refreshing to the soul, And stout doctrine was expounded (while my hand condensed a fist) Till the sinner sank confounded by some stalwart Calvinist, As he piled up proof on reason and with scripture clenched it all Against tenets that were treason to the God of John and Paul, With his many points and “lastly” after three hours at a stretch While he showed the Word was vastly more than any impious wretch With his candlesticks and crotchet and the Fathers and the Church Which had truth but strove to botch it and left starvelings in the lurch; When the Spirit breathed in power on the erring and the lost, And we had a heavenly shower like the fall of Pentecost. O the vestures and the cassock which they borrowed right from Rome, Could not save them from the hassock which I fulminated home When my orthodox emotions craved an outlet and redress, If I found the false devotions of mere superstitiousness. I would keep a sound theology at whatever risk or price, With fierce fractions for apology of the Roman sacrifice; And however hurt, my spare bones were as ready as before At the bid of “Praise-God-Barebones” to destroy or to adore. No one heard the worldly laughter of transgressors on my lips, When the hope of the hereafter with its wholesome sad eclipse Filled my breast with sacred glowing and a reverent great calm Like a fountain overflowing, that inspired each act or psalm. From the carnal earth confusements I abstained with rigid zeal And I gat no fit amusements save in testimony's seal, When the passion of the martyrs spurred my spirit and defied Thrones and thunders, lords and garters, and aloud I testified. For my pleasures all were serious, I rejoiced in prayer and praise And religious joys mysterious which might quicken and upraise Soul and conscience to the summit of the loftiest life, and sound Deeps that never mortal plummet could attain or yet had found. But the thought of execution, when the rebels and their hoard Met with righteous retribution at the coming of the Lord And the spoiler bowed to capture and false prophets went to doom, Was to me a thought of rapture and it glorified the gloom. O the bliss of just damnation for all men, except the few Who from tears and tribulation in the fire were born anew, Was the meat that always nourished me beneath the cross of care; And though unbelievers flourished and believers had no share In the prizes and the portions which in malediction fell, When I pictured their contortions and their agonies in hell, I waxed merry and my spare bones danced to echoes of their groans And the heart of “Praise-God-Barebones” found sweet music in their moans. I have lived in many ages, but I never would recant And am proud of all the stages I have striven as Protestant, With my principles of rigour and the true celestial seeds Which inspired unearthly vigour in the dead and dying creeds. I have guided glorious factions as a counsellor and friend, Through the predetermined actions to the predetermined end, While I made and unmade history in the dungeon and the stocks And from Rome's accursèd mystery tore the veil and opened locks; To let in the air of freedom and let out the poison breath, That the Lord might reign in Edom and the palaces of death And lose nought of the fair total of His righteous dues and laud, When I crushed the sacerdotal arm and tyranny of fraud. And though one in a minority, Athanasius-like I stood In the battle with authority for the scriptural and good— For our liberties' fruition, and the conscience and the man, Against churches and tradition and the Pope and priestly ban; And though pilloried and branded, and with mutilated flesh Under torture single-handed I have died; I rose afresh From the unreleasing portal of the tomb that burst for me, Who for ever was immortal, and for ever more will be. Call me fanatic, dissenter, or a ranting, canting knave, Stone me, burn me, I re-enter the old world if through the grave; But to triumph in my spare bones over error and its spell, And to heap as “Praise-God-Barebones” yet more hecatombs in hell. THE MAGIC WAND. Through the long years I groped Dimly, in silence utter closing me like a shutter Round, while I vainly hoped. All beyond me was gloom, wrath, and relentless hate Beckoning but to doom and a predestined fate. Feebly with foolish riving did I essay to burst Forth with a frantic striving, far as a mortal durst. Nothing replied but sound Made by my own dull cry, mocking the agony Still with a drear rebound. Whither could I look up, into a Face Diviner? Where, though in furnace, sup with the supreme Refiner? How should I guide my stumbling steps that had found no track, Save of despair and humbling, homeward from sin and wrack? Then lo, a prayer, though weak Yet with a mighty shaping, dropt in unmeant escaping From lips unframed to speak; Shot by the shadowed heart, full as a winter well, Hiding in tears apart from mirth or marriage bell. But in a moment Pity came, and I knew not whence, As on a sunless city falls day's magnificence. Not like an empty wraith, It met my moulding hand which grew to its command— The magic wand of faith. O from the dreadful Night, out of the blank past seeing, This with its daring light called a new bourne to being; Free beyond bars and thunder forming a bliss and clue, It clove the clouds asunder which veiled God's rose of blue. Now master of tears and toil, Fashioning fiery leaven, I make my hope and heaven And hive the future spoil. While thus the present lot, the lack and dire distress, The unequal bane and blot, get here a rich redress. For now I build at pleasure and make the balance right, With fairer weights and measure correcting this sad plight. I have whatever state Is chosen, and poverty and pinched mortality With worlds I compensate. So when the lightning slays or cares bring evil fretting, I hold above their ways my kingdom without setting. Things round me pale or perish, but death cannot come nigh The spaces which I cherish, my boundless peace on high. THE NOTE OF NATURE. Brother, I mark how all the many things Which people these great lands, The thought, the thunder, The harp of life that has a thousand strings, The master with his cosmic hands Who makes and breaks asunder; The cheek's delicious rose that turns so pale, The soul that must be shriven Ere it may peaceful lie; These every one will utter the full tale, Which unto each is given— Only do thus and die. The meanest lichen on the humble stone Which hardly greets the eye In garb of yellow, Has yet a glory on its russet throne The seat of pure Divinity, And claims in that its fellow; It shall express the burden of its life, The story that it bringeth Of lesser lights and shades, And though it have no part in broader strife Unto itself it singeth— Only does this and fades. Nor is the Father, who created all, Diverse from us herein; Yet He is dying In works, that reach perfection but to fall; And is to every growth akin, Which speaks some truth in flying. In each new blossom and in each glad bird, Which waves a wing or petal Of splendour and is gone, He moves and by His spirit they are stirr'd; He shines in moss and metal, And then He passes on. And thus the awful breath of living song Is mine a moment space, And it must utter Whate'er it will—I may not do it wrong; And I am carried to my place, A leaf that can but flutter. I have no choice except to be the note Whereon a while it lingers, In tempest from the north Or sweetness of the south and suns remote; I feel it like God's fingers, And then it passes forth. “OPEN THOU MINE EYES.” No revelation, Lord, we ask Who humbly look to Thee, But just behind the earthly mask Of little things and daily task The living truth to see; For if we had the trustful eyes Which give the larger ken And fashion very children wise, The lowliest work in land and skies Would be transfigured then; We should but find our judgments mean, And nothing common or unclean. The daisy would shine out more fair Than any flower or tree, As much Thy footstool as the air Which is Thy chariot, and a stair Uplifting us to Thee; For surely what is scattered far And wide Thou lovest most, It breathes a glory which no star Of all the dazzling orbs that are Has ever made its boast; And in its oft repeated part, It tells the secret of Thy heart. The revelation all is plain And loudly points to Thee, Were not our vision dark and vain Which moves a prisoner in its chain— And nought but error free; Though still Thy love is written large In creeping moss or man, Eternity is each thing's charge, The Infinite o'erflows its marge And speaks Thy perfect plan. Nor lacks the tiniest way or weed, A glimmer of immortal seed. But we, O Lord, are madly blind, And yet refuse to see The Wisdom chanted by the wind, The Power that follows us behind In mercy sent by Thee; Though Thou Thyself, in good and ill, Dost show as pattern true, And stamp the wonder of Thy will The law of star and daisy still, And one celestial clue. But ere Thou art our inward light, We walk for ever in the night. THE STAR OF THE MAGI. The night was very dark and dread, Above me knelled the thunder As if with tolling to the dead, And flints rose cruel under; While through the clouds like funeral shrouds Which it did tear asunder, A ghastly moon glared overhead. But in that close and coffined night, Which hid the roads and meadows With arms of awful shadows, I had a brave and blessed light. For in my bosom burned a lamp Supplied with lustre solemn Which spoke, as from a reverend shrine Some secret glory saith— “Behold the oil and sacred stamp, Which only court and column Contain that house the Man Divine”— Because I walked by Faith. And now I cannot wander far Or miss the haven holy, Who have the Magi's steadfast star A light within me lowly. The day was very drear, and stone And thorn pursued my paces, While famine with its bitter zone Girt me in desert spaces; An angry wind, which snarled behind, Struck me in sudden places; And still I did not step alone. I had for ever by my side, In wastes all lean and yellow, The friend that was my fellow Prepared to guard me round and guide. For with me though unseen there went The mate of many a trial, That often had most truly proved The falsehood of each wraith; And thus, if pale and penitent With fast and sore denial, In trembling joy I onward moved— Because I walked with Faith. But now I cannot lose the way, And in my journey stumble; I simply pause to praise, or pray For love to keep me humble. GOD'S TUNERS. Out of His fulness, God was good, He gave the hungry lands Their purple hill and waving wood, The rivers' sapphire bands, The mighty dew which doth renew Our earth with gentle hands, And golden grace of womanhood— But still they made demands. He stript Himself of garments fair And tore His Heart asunder, To paint the blue upon the air And the green carpet under; He hung his halo in the hair Of virgins mounting the white stair, Through death, to thrones of thunder. He watered with His richest tears The world and down the rolling years Sent on that fruitful flood, And washed away our cruel fears In His own saving Blood. But yet in the exceeding store Of love and long dark lashes Which kindled hearts of ashes, The greedy nations craved for more. But then He bared His mighty breast And took the music out, Which was the universe's rest And fired the battle shout— The voice we hear with inward ear, In ministries of doubt; And soft it lay on souls opprest, It compassed earth about. He gave at last His very life Which sets the planet singing, And makes the sacrificial knife A balm of angels' bringing; While in the lot with discord rife And ruin and its wormy strife, It came like roses clinging. By cunning harp and prophet rune, It put the weary lands in tune And lorded over chance, The winter turned to laughing June And sorrow could but dance. For in the bosom it was wine Of sacramental chalice, Which conquered care and malice, And left the meanest drudge divine. O joy beyond all words that are Which is so wondrous strong, It breaks the prison's iron bar And remedies each wrong; It finds the gold beneath the mould And spins the earth along, Till we forget the scorn or scar— God's liturgies of song! The bruisèd maiden in the dust Bent as a weeping willow, The rover with red hand of lust Whose bondsman is the billow, The spirit eaten as with rust All here revive their powers of trust, And seek a soothing pillow. It is a temple where we meet And get repose for failing feet Upon a common ground, And prove the vilest fortune sweet Within one sacred bound. We drop the sadness and the sin Wherein we rot and welter, And see in this fair shelter Both man and God are close akin. And then at rare and solemn times God sends His Tuners down, To mend the mischief of the climes When gathering troubles frown; They bring new strains for bitter pains That mock the kingliest crown, Until the globe with gladder chimes Puts on a wedding gown. They go about through darkling Space Fresh melody to scatter In notes that mark the Master's pace, And thrill the deadest matter; For they have looked upon that Face Giving them all their vital grace, Which no one's praise can flatter. And they have heard the Maker speak The spell which they though dimly wreak In mysteries of sound, To cheer the wandering and the weak Who walk their lonely round. And with their healing harmonies They open every portal, And pour into this mortal The breath of the eternities. A GOOD REPORT. O in a light most beautiful and sweet Did Christ return from that drear dolorous land, Crowned by His conquests, and with travelled feet And benedictions in His open hand. For He had triumphed over even death And trod it low with His sublimer trust, Which could not there be holden, and His breath Enkindled to new life the mouldering dust; He bade it blossom with a sudden power, When the old prisoning grave was spoiled and rent, In that immortal resurrection flower— The ransomed soul's young fair enfranchisement. Death was a “shadow,” as He said, and short The tenure of its cold relaxing might, And rich with comfort all the good report He wrung from its inhospitable night. For with the blessèd olive branch He came Back from the deluge impotent to drown, Which by subjected sin but He could tame Alone and captive evermore keep down. For those grim walls of silence and despair Crumbled and fell before His righteous road, That human hearts at length might thus repair In Him their hopes and drop the weary load. No sorrow was the message that He brought Out of the darkness which had wrapt Him round, And quenched a season sight but not the thought Of everlasting Love unbid, unbound; And not bereavement and the awful blank In separation with its rayless gloom, If for our future solace then He sank Consenting to the judgment and the doom; And not the natural pain which we must know Though God Himself shall wipe away our tears, And the sad sentence laid on man below Inevitable as the eclipse of fears. Far otherwise the news, when he had run That dreadful race which now no more is dim, In the great glory of the unsetting Sun, For those who trust and truly follow Him. He said that it was well for mortals thus To go, and death would be a pleasant place, The door of life, which did unclose to us The fulness of His own exceeding grace. And though the grief and trouble might not cease Which only taught us in His strength to stand, The secret of the very grave was peace And just the entrance to the Promised Land. MY SPECULUM. At times I let my fancy wander, And with its speculum I ponder The mysteries of Space; My travelled thought spreads out its wings Beyond the utmost verge of things, And spans the furthest place. Then mirrored shape and awful measure Of many an unknown hidden treasure I gather on my glass; The far result of aimless toil, An unimagined splendid spoil Appearing not to pass. Bright fantasies of fairy visions Which once I deemed but soft derisions, I see are lovely fact; And beautiful conjectured lights, Buried beneath a thousand nights, Leap into living act. My starry dreams stand out in glory And prove beyond the wildest story, How strange realities; And in my very words I find Unconscious witnesses to mind, And fair theologies. MY BRIDAL-CHAMBER. O I am waiting for my Lord to come, And dwell within the compass of this breast Empalaced by Him as a fitting home, Wherein He may a little while take rest, Unworthy I shall ever be, but yet I daily purge my humble house and sweep The dim and dusty rooms for Him, and set A table garnished with obeisance deep. And I have emptied it of all things vile By penitence of tears and holy fast, To win one word of welcome or a smile Which would bestow a bountiful repast. I do renounce the squalid world and mean Delights that only humour the vain flesh, And make myself mere nothingness but clean Whereon he can at pleasure build afresh. The vacant chair stands ready for His seat, A willing mind in duteous homage bent, Responsive to His touch, that He may eat And drink of utter love and be content. This pure heart is prepared by sweetest thought Like bridal-chambers with fair linen white To take its King and Husband in, and wrought Thereby with Him to beauty infinite. GENESIS OF A SOUL. Without a soul, like yours I came Into these lands, God builded fair this mortal frame And gave me cunning hands; But there was something dimly needed, Though all unheeded And hardly missing at the first,— A beautiful sad thirst. But this at times I only felt About me and not in me, seeing No place or purpose when I knelt For my dull being. Without a soul, I had no part With other men, And a cold aching in my heart Disturbed my narrow ken; Life was a round of impositions, Though premonitions Of awful ranges far beyond Forbade me to despond. The brute I was with stunted powers Chafed in its mortal mansion, It waxed aware of dazzling dowers And craved expansion. Without a soul, I could not fill One office high, And I went groping darkly still When Heaven itself was nigh; A dearth with dreary nameless anguish Which made me languish, Fell deeper while it wrapped me round With haunting hopeless bound. I held no stake in earthly things Nor trysting-place for common kindness, And threatening shades and murmurings Burst through my blindness. Without a soul I might not tread Along the path, Which skirts the borders of the dead And compassed in with wrath. The little blank grew daily vaster And veiled disaster, Though glimpses of a higher state Dawned on me delicate. And with no interest or plan To lend my life a proper reason, I moved a creature not a man Born out of season. Without a soul I travailed sore With solemn fears, I could not though I would adore With deaf and earthbound ears; Until a child with plaything broken And grief unspoken, Rousing the love that in me lay Let in a shining ray; But whence the sudden glory fell And what this new and second nature, I who accepted cannot tell Its legislature. Without a soul I was not now An exile strange, And all my being seem to bow Responsive to the change; A wellspring from its bases bubbling Dispersed the troubling, And through me poured the pleasant streams Of living dreams; There was a stirring with a glow Like sunlight of the bluest weather, And secret powers above, below, All rushed together. Without a soul I might not be A bondsman still, When once the inner part of me Was touched by alien ill; I lost myself to find in others And bruisèd brothers, Myself again but yet more bright And blest in borrowed light; For in that little child forlorn, I in my barren cold captivity Was at a radiant hour re-born Into Divinity. Without a soul I shall not live Though ages pass, And worlds turn pale and fugitive Or fade as flowers and grass; I have the secret and assurance Of that endurance, Which though the mountains faint and fail Shall over all prevail; And if I sometimes miss the clue Or fret in this poor human border, I am a portion of the true Eternal order. “HAVE WE NOT ALL ONE FATHER?” A common feeling Makes the mighty land So little, that with earth's rude reeling It seems to lie within the hand, And find a station more than even by gravitation— A force it never may withstand. It makes the universe a street In the same city, Where rival duties are not done And men and women gaily meet While out of pity, All just for others are as one. A common danger Lends a kinship true To bird and brute and friend and stranger, And shows the binding secret clue; For there affection starts up with the lost direction, And grants to each his vital due. It seeks a single home in God, From angry weather And suffering with its thunder throes; It leads where Blessed Feet have trod, And draws together Into one rest divided foes. A common treasure In a guiding hope, Metes prince and peasant with one sacred measure And overshines in its blue cope; It links, like wedding ties, the souls that else were shedding Sweet blossoms with no power to ope. It brings to beauty jangled parts And gently carries Its sacrament to the cold lip, And joining sundered hands and hearts Divinely tarries For grace of holy partnership. A common Father, As the equal sky, Alone prevails to gladden all and gather The nations in one family; And by His giving of the light for living Knits every age with sympathy. And in the sorrow breathed by things, The touch that mellows Comes from His hand upraised to bless, Which clasps us as with shadowed wings And makes us fellows In union of fair Christliness. SHE PASSED IN MUSIC. She passed in music, for her death Was wonderful and fair; As if the Master with her breath Did play His perfect air. For all her life was leading up Unto this gracious plan, In sweetness like a loving cup Until it over-ran. And through her days' young festival She kept a secret tune, Which with its voices virginal Made her bright bosom June. Sometimes we heard or seemed to hear The fragrance of a cry, Which fashioned hope of solemn fear And yet was mystery. But in her shadow of sweet shame She dreaded jest or doubt, And only the dissolving frame Could let its glory out. She could not utter one small part, Who treasures had to give; Till the great music broke her heart, And dying learned to live. DYING DAILY. Father, I feel this heart of mine Just from its very love Must break, with all its precious wine, In yearning so above. I am so crushed by mercy's weight And blessings yet to be, I can no longer bear the freight With which Thou loadest me. It seems in praise's every burst Of passion and desire, As only true thanksgiving durst, I must in song expire, Each moment is a miracle, A gift that cannot fade; And in Thy tender crucible, I hourly am re-made. For what is this poor narrow breast That Thou should'st ever come, To live there as no passing guest And honour it as Home? Ah, when I know I darkly lie So oft in bondage rude, At thought of Thee I daily die From utter gratitude. ‘YET THE STAR WAS THERE.” I took my magic glass and swept the sky And found the systems there, the rhythmic romp, The centuried circuits and the measured fall Of planets pulsing through eternity; I marked the wonder of the woven pomp, Wheel within wheel, and knew and loved them all. I mapt them with a careless eye, and went From star to star, as through his native land The master walks and communes with his kin; They seemed by just my purpose to be bent, And moved in concert with my guiding hand— But everywhere I carried my own sin. I looked among my fellows, and I saw The common round of common thoughts and things; No brighter maiden and no broader man, But dull submission to one dreary law, Instead of hush that heralds coming kings To mould the world with new majestic plan. Then in a moment rushed a sudden light Upon my glance, so dark to that which gave A clue and utterance to the whole—as where, In palaces of purple orient night, The wash of seas in some far coral cave Awakes dull eyes—and yet the star was there. FALLING UP. I lost my hopeless idle hold at length from little care, For pride had made me over-bold and slew me unaware; While, as I fell, a funeral-bell Bade me for death prepare. Earth swam before my swooning eyes, Time seemed itself to pass With all the pageants of the skies like pictures in a glass; A burning scroll, my very soul Shrank up as shrivelled grass. Sin's gloomy garment wrapt me round, as deeper still I went Beyond the plummet's utmost bound, in its gray cerement; With friends most dear, in ghastly fear Dragged low by my descent. For when I dropt in coward dread, to save myself I threw These arms in selfish haste outspread on lives that blameless grew; And I the love, that bloomed above, To one grim ruin drew. But in the horror of my fall, unconscious, yet I prayed With penitence that even through all my darkest deeds had stayed; A broken cry of agony, That would not be delayed. A call for mercy and of grief shot heavenward as a dart, Which in mere utterance was relief and more than human art; A simple sigh, that mounted high, Torn from my bleeding heart. And in a moment then I found I was not sinking fast, But risen and to a purer ground beyond the stormy blast; And the blue sky laughed pleasantly, Which had been overcast. For when I dashed the golden cup of poison from my grip, I was forgiven and falling up that I might never slip; While, swift to greet me, Mercy sweet Laid kisses on my lip. LIVING THE LIFE. The Lord in mercy came to me In all my blots and misses, And spoke of blessed things to be— His eyes looked full of kisses. But on his head a shameful crown Of thorns exceeding cruel, My own, did weigh him sadly down— And yet shone as a jewel. While on his bruised and bended shoulder, Borne as through bitter strife, My cross, which seem to wear Him older Living the life. He laid the crown upon my head, His own, with benediction, That royally I thus might tread His highway of affliction. The thorns were very sharp but shot Through me like new vitality, And though the furnace fire was hot It bathed in immortality. Each little loss turned to an altar With sacrificial knife, And yet no moment could I falter— Living the life. He laid the cross upon my back, His own, with words of healing; Till all the stones, along the track, Stood out like stars' revealing. And every nail a silken glove Grew out of woesome iron, Which as with arms of utter love My sadness did environ. And every wound was richer sweetness With milk and honey rife, And this poor soul got grand completeness— Living the life. And now we have a common heart In peace or angry weather, We do not have one thought apart— We bear and burn together. My very Crown of care it is, The thorns my only guerdon With all the suffering, and yet His No less the precious burden. The Cross, with which I would not tarry, A treasure dear as wife, He makes His own and loves to carry— Living the life. THE SORROW OF THINGS. There was a sorrow at the heart of things, I thought and dreamed of gladness Among the shocks and overshadowings, And murmurs as of madness; Where 'er I went, in daily discontent I found the foot of sadness. It wailed in winds, and sobbed in piteous pleas From the great surge of far tormented seas, Which broke on shores untravelled; It trembled up, where fairies liked to sup That sipped the sweetness of the buttercup, A mystery not unravelled. It made the monarch's crown a ring of fire And clouded all the glitter, While in the maiden's delicate attire Its thread was black and bitter; And the sweet bird, by God's own music stirred, Learnt thus its mournful twitter. And on the dazzling blue of doming skies It lay like unshed tears on troubled eyes, And whispered they were mortal; It seemed to slip from even the rosie st lip, And stronger than the web of statesmanship, Creaked in the palace portal. But then betwixt the moonrise and the morn When the tired earth was resting, I saw a cherub playing with a thorn That pierced a king's investing; And oft he plied the cruel point, and tried It for his own true testing. And then into the twilight of my brain Dawned slowly the pure blessedness of pain, And passion's blood-red stigma; The causeless care which killed and did not spare, Now to the laughter of a child laid bare The soul of its enigma. And the old sorrow at the heart of things, Became the secret flutter Of beautiful but prisoned angel wings, And words they could not utter; Which but for grief would never find relief, Behind the fleshly shutter. While all the misery was to kindness kin, Or just the sunlight fretting to come in And flood the life with glory; For only thus might insight come to us, By awful searchings yet most amorous To tell God's dear love story. COLLOQUIUM CUM DEO. “Come, now, and let us reason,” said the Lord, “In peace of night and purple weather, And I will listen to my servant's cry!” But he was leaning on His judgment sword, When we in silence talked together. I said, “This little fleece of ours is dry, Nor do thy blessed fountains yet afford To silver one dear swallow's feather, When round us dew is falling pleasantly.” Heaven opened to my reach And in the quiet spake a little bird, and brake The waters on the beach. “Acquaint thyself with Me, and I will stanch Thy trouble,” said the Lord, and nearer He drew to me and veiled the awful fire, And in His hand he held an olive branch. “Though thou, my earthly son, art dearer Than words can tell, yet vain is that desire; To know why on some separate rock or ranch Rain comes not, while I am a Hearer Still of the prayers that up to heaven aspire.” And in the dreadful calm Which for a moment fell, a wind began to swell And lifted up a psalm. I hid my face in humble fear, and bent Before His solemn presence kneeling; But then once more in gentleness He spake, As one who played on some poor instrument That owned but uttered not his feeling. “To learn the least in truth thou must awake, And comprehend the whole of continent Or isle and every system wheeling Through Space, for all of common ties partake.” And from the distant shore Dim voices seemed to raise an ecstasy of praise, And chanted evermore. “Be patient with me, Lord,” I cried, and laid My forehead in the dust and shivered, That I should commune with my Maker so; “But wherefore dost Thou give a partial aid, When we do pine to be delivered And watch how elsewhere sweet Thy wellsprings flow? The sacrifice by us is also paid, And this torn breast has quaked and quivered With offerings free that stript and left me low.” And then a sudden cloud Rose like a threatening hand, and darkened sea and land That seemed to sigh aloud. But in the stillness I did hear His Heart, Which is the soul of Nature throbbing; As over me He breathed His blasting power, Yet softened to one ray and without smart, And cheered me in the shadow sobbing. “The dew is there, if faith perceived the dower And knew what makes its hidden treasure start, Or took its own that needs no robbing; And, in thy waste, I see the watered flower.” But, lo, a happy hush Dropt on my spirit spent, and all the Orient Became one red-rose blush. NUMBERED AND WEIGHED. Lord, I know my days are numbered And each throbbing of my heart, Though I am with care so cumbered, In creation's plan has part; And throughout the endless ages Of forgotten stars and stages First within Thy Love did start, And from that most awful seat Gave its earliest tender beat; And each noteless tiny second Is as needful to the life as a century of strife, And by Thee esteemed and reckoned. Yes, each separate hair is counted And the gain above the loss, With the step I hardly mounted Leading up to the sweet Cross; And before the world had being In Thy calm eternal seeing Fires were heated for my dross, And the furnace and the throne Then were made for me alone; All was done by Thy decision, And each slender detail mapt (though within the millions wrapt) By Thy great and wise prevision. Every bit of me is measured By the wisdom without end, Every sigh or teardrop treasured By One closer than a friend; Not an atom of my nature, But by Thee is meted stature And with Thine prepared to blend; For Thou dost revive my sloth, And art strength and standard both. On my stains Thou pourest meetness, And hast from Thy very breast stript the royal righteous vest Clothing me with Thy completeness. Every act is weighed most kindly In those balances of Grace, And the weakness that walks blindly In Thy mercy finds a place— Just to that for ever fitted— Where I stand at peace acquitted, In the sunshine of Thy Face. Every effort, at Thy Feet, Has its value and is sweet, Though these earthly clouds may dim it; If it only wants to be Christly, and is striven for Thee; And Thy love breaks down its limit. REHOBOTH. In the world of toil I laboured as rolled periods by, Not like others drummed and tabored to the victory; But with grief for ever wearing, crushed by burdens, as if bearing All eternity. Foes with longer arms and stronger wills were surging round in wrath, And they thrust me farther off not without contempt and scoff From the purpose of my path. Insolence and purple pride swept above me in the tide Of a cruel art, As on pavement stone; And unheeded and unneeded I appeared apart, Outside pity and a place where each had a resting-space, Useless and alone. Unto Bel they bowed the knee, or to naked Ashtaroth; But a whisper spoke to me—“Rehoboth.” In the many realms of Nature, lo, I wandered far; Seeking for some legislature which upraised no bar To my lordship, where no other quarrelled with me, if my brother Swayed a lofty star. Weeds had holy tasks and lowly insects office set and sure, And a niche of honour each beyond vulgar wreck or reach Ordered and at last secure. But I was a wasted thing, bloomless flower and throneless king Separate from the rest, And to nothing born Out of season with no reason for a singing breast; Never meant to blossom true into scarlet robes or blue, Just a barren thorn. I escaped the service seal, laid on even the midge or moth; But I heard a trumpet peal—“Rehoboth.” Thinkers rose with broad opinions covering all Time, And tall Poets had dominions over every clime; While most ripe and reverend sages, with the murmur of their pages, Made a solemn chime. I was singing too and ringing bells that could not do a wrong, In my humble quiet nook as I read the Sacred Book, For the pensive evensong. But they drowned my tiny note when I darkly sung, and wrote Now a tender line, Then a pretty thought; And their louder strains and prouder echoed through the shrine, While my sad and sober tune like a rose too late for June Looked but idly wrought. Death seemed better, had I tied round my frame the burial cloth; But a call in mercy cried—“Rehoboth.” Crowded were the courts, and gilded nobles went and came Up the steps of marble builded to the Blessed Name; Souls of light and souls of learning, with the insufferable yearning Kindled to a flame, For that knowledge which no college of the largest lore can give; Ah, they held the wiser plan and the wisdom true, that man Not by bread alone may live. Faces crowned with mystic might, awfully intent and bright, Moved on missions vast Under that blue dome, Armed with grateful love and fateful powers from their high past, And about the shine and shades of the temple colonnades Sped, within their Home. With one servant of His choice, could the master break His troth? And afar a thunder Voice—“Rehoboth.” BEAUTIFUL FOE. Home of great thoughts, without, within, A Voice I cannot smother, Beautiful Foe and Brother, Unmarked but not unmoved by sin And to my every pulse akin, Myself and yet Another! The Maker and the Creature, mine, So near and yon blue distance Too far to be assistance! But still Thy tendrils round me twine Most human Thou and most divine, Unseen but felt Existence. Ah, from a Baby Thou hast grown With me to riper graces, And taken tiny paces That trembled dearly with my own; Familiar still while all unknown, And everywhere Thy traces. Unutterably grand and vast, Without a touch or tittle Of flaw, yet to a brittle Poor reed that quivers in the blast A Fellow-Sufferer to the last, Magnificently little. Thy rays from each remoter star Fall on me, and Thy savour Of mercy, lends a favour Like jewels to the shameful scar; And Thou art portal, and the bar With prison's iron flavour. The colour of the rose's bloom, Is but Thy Face's blushing; And in the mother's hushing That rocks her infant, Thou hast room; And in the horror and the gloom, I hear Thy fountains gushing. Thou art my Master and my Slave, Who grantest me the vision Turned only to derision; Thou doest more than all I crave, Alike the cradle and the grave Of every high decision. Thy riches are my own, and still From Thee I always borrow; Thou art the joy and sorrow, Whereby with faltering hands I fill The measured cup of good and ill, O never-coming Morrow. The Truth, and yet the hidden Heart Of fairest dreams and fictions; Bright Presence in afflictions, And yet most terribly apart When buried lusts like ghosts upstart, Sum of all contradictions. My Heavenly Father, and the Child Of these exalted fancies, The rapture of romances; A blushing Furnace, and a mild Dim Shadow shed on passions wild And warring circumstances. Dear Adversary and the Friend To whom I fly from sinning; Lost in each selfish winning, And gained when lavishly I spend; The Light, the Night, the glorious End And ever-new Beginning. The whole and Part of every fact Or thought, my Bane and Blessing; For wrong the sure Redressing, And breathing through the simplest act O Life of every mortal pact, Death is but Thy caressing. THE GREATNESS OF GOD. O God, Thou art so very wise And wonderfully tall, That unto Thee I cannot rise Who am exceeding small; And darkling feet, that climb to greet Thy greatness, only fall. For I am a wee baby thing And helpless to Thy goodness cling, As to a mother's gown; And lest I tumble from Thy lap Or meet with woe or evil hap, Thy Mercy keeps me down. Thy Sweetness, as a swaddling robe, From trembling toe to chin— While it doth compass the wide globe, Despite the shame and sin— Yet wraps me round, in peace enwound, And tucks me warmly in. But if at times I suffer pain And dimly reach to Thee in vain Or feel a ruder shock, When threatening shadows on me shut And Thou art hidden, it is but The cradle that must rock. Beneath Thy Majesty I rest As under some high tree, And hear the beating of the Breast Which yet I cannot see; Each adverse air is just a stair And lifteth up to Thee. I know that nothing less than Love Is all below me and above, Though oft I wander blind; And the broad marvel of Thy Power, As soft as dew upon a flower, Doth buttress me behind. Crushed with Thy Grandeur I would make A footstool on Thy floor, Or be a mat for Thy dear sake Laid at the temple door; And if the dust, before Thee thrust, I never could be poor. At night I sometimes may not sleep From thinking of the dreadful deep Of Thy surpassing Grace; I cannot fly from Thee, Thy breath Is my whole life and very death The dawning of Thy face. EDEN FLOWERS. I put my labour to the plough, I wrestled with the surly land And fought the cruel stone and weed; In hope that yet the fruited bough Would blush in answer to the hand, Which worked and planted living seed. And, with the harrow, like an arrow My prayer went up a golden creed, As if it were a winged command. I drudged through darkness, and no time Was spared to hear the harvest chime; Though nothing came but barren blame. I dropt my life itself, and sowed My body in the hungry soil And yielded to the yawning grave; I grudged no treasure, and I owed Not any pulse of grievous toil Nor service such as fits the slave. And then a glory beyond story Broke from it, which earth never gave And tyrant death could not despoil. For from the crumbling of my flesh My faded years bloomed out afresh, In strange new powers like Eden flowers. I.—HELL. MEMORY. I did remember all my sins, they flocked Like gibbering ghosts and sheeted Unearthly shapes that mowed at me and mocked, Unsummoned and ungreeted; And with a threatening hand and thwart Set gaze of features grim and swart, They came and frowned and fleeted. Old buried vices from forgotten graves Like skeletons upstarted, Re-kindling embers pale in sunless caves, And cursed me and departed; But, ere they went, they did bequeath The cerements that hope enwreath, And left me broken-hearted. The charities of piety long past, No more with sweet perfuming About the error of my footsteps cast A gentle fair illuming; And conscience, with its funeral bell Tolled only, and the thought was hell— A secret slow consuming. II.—HEAVEN. MEMORY. I did remember all my brother's deeds, The loyalties and tender Shy ministries that, out of golden creeds, Bloomed with no passing splendour; And in the shadow where he dwelt That we might shine, I richly felt The life that was surrender. The services of ripe and reverend use Whereby he was surrounded, The healing touch of light, and gifts profuse In which his path abounded;— I warmed my wintry heart, and drank Of these pure fountains, though I shrank Before his love confounded. But O the praise was medicine to me yet, That purged with gracious sifting, And made a morning that could never set Among these pageants drifting; I gathered to me what he wrought In blessing, and heaven was the thought— And God's own great uplifting. THE LOST SACRAMENT. Wearied of men and babble and brute ways, The wretched millround of the sordid days. I turned to Nature and myself, and sought A calmer refuge in the realm of thought, And remedies for ills that had no cure In earthly medicine. Gladsomely I went Along a pathless road serene and sure, Where all was so familar and yet strange, As if in search of some Lost Sacrament And the great choosing beyond reach of change. I saw my God in Nature, as we see Through stained cathedral glass a form of grace That shines and shifts and has no settled place And here is One, and there the mystic Three Or now as clear as sunlight and now dark; A revelation both of sun and moon, That gleams with many a blessed shape or boon, And vanishes in splendour, as we mark. For there were windows that kept out the beams Of noontide, or just painted a dim floor And silent marble with their mighty dreams, Or half unbosomed raptures of white charms To cheat the wondering eye; and there a door Of dazzlement, but like forbidding arms Not without welcome too, would opening shut The escaping glory back ere it could give A gleam, except a fragment fugitive, Yet was itself the secret, with a knot Which all could read though none by wisdom cut; And there rose pillars that uplifted nought, But radiant and rejoicing in their lot, Like beautiful fond actions idly done At hazard and in happiness for none, Beyond our censure, above praises wrought As in an empty world. The fragrancy Of architecture, and the hidden clue That lends each fabric its fair hope and line, Were there and yielded up the riddling tears With exhalations of all poetry And mysteries of ancient faiths and fears. I feasted upon flowers, and lightly stole Its colour from the inward core of things Behind the curtain on the wheels and wings Which move the systems in their measured track; I found the part was bigger than the whole, And in the night the Truth that guided back. For light and shadow there were one, and led Up though by devious circuits to the same Supremacy of goal, the faint tops high Beyond the footstep's most ecstatic tread But yet in spirit unutterably nigh— And one the notion and its righteous name. I saw the sweet of littleness, the joy Past our expression in the cloistered cell, Alike the perfume of a passing toy And spring whence passion drew its awesome spell. For the dumb stone and silent services Of woods and waters, as at peace they stood In pictured trance, had tender languages To ears of trust and souls of maidenhood; And in their seasons ministered as much As shouting myriads of the troublous town, Where overhangs the heaven of iron one frown, With the low murmur or the tiny touch Which marry us to God by subtlest tie. And Nature, as the throbbing heart of man Doth pause and beat again or it must die, Betwixt the full performance and its plan Sleeps, and awakes to work in beauty. Thus I saw beneath the outwardness of sky And earth the splendid unreality, The noteless things and nullities, that bore No narrow measure of mere Space and Time And yet possessed a meaning dear to us; The vision of some far forgotten shore, Of elder days and in some other clime; And though they did not bow to every call Were mingled with the Infinite and All, And memories of lofty moods, and breath Of larger moments one with life and death. The precious trifles, and the infant plays That nothing are and nothing mean and still Help us to triumph over armoured ill And roll the worlds on their predestined ways Or build up creeds and characters, I saw— And something less in stars than in the straw Crushed by a pilgrim heel. The grace that shone Just for a maddening minute and was gone Before we grasped it and its jewelled text Was grander than utilities of gold That bulked in royal palaces and filled The minds of people with the glare perplext; And kin to what was stateliest and old, Or through the breast of boundless Nature thrilled. The doing little greatly and for nought Save the mere bliss of doing it so well, The flower of stillness and the festival And knowledge more than being and unbought By vulgar arts of precept practical, A biding in the bourne where secrets dwell; Laid on me kindly hands, and lured my heart To seek those circles of green rest apart. And there among the elements I found The archetypes of whatso'er we think, In ecstasy that overflows the brink Of this small earth and makes it holy ground; The love that lives in dying, as the box Of alabaster broken for the head We honour, which is Christ to us and spread With splendour—if no halo orthodox; And silver fountains of most futile tears Seen through a tawny cloud of tumbled hair, And then a wealth of subtlety and heed Lavished upon a leaf to form it fair For ever and for ever through the lands; And angels whispering into shell-like ears Some word of light to be the saving seed Of worlds to come, when dropt by baby lips Which babble on through earthquake and eclipse, And mould the service of imperial hands; The minor thoughts and dim moralities, Unseen, unknown, and yet the life of each And all who are uncrowned but rule and teach With sceptres of the sweet philosophies. I bathed me deep in that most gentle hope Which falls as dew and wraps us closely round Lest we should spill our music on the ground And fail in sin and darkness, or the scent Of beautiful rich souls be idly spent Before they climbed the summit of the slope. But first I laved my sullied mouth and arms In the white waters of that Purity Which flows from God and is the vital breath Of saints that walk with Him, though fearfully, In joy, beyond the malices of harms Through stillness as of night's delicious death. And thus my eyes were opened, and I saw The vision of the Blessed One, whose name Is Silence and our Comfort, and the law Which guards us virgin-wise from shade of shame And recreates with charity as wine Poured into dumb dead veins, and turns divine. But mingling then with masses, or the lone Sad little lot of man oppressed by fate, Or left to struggle forth disconsolate And all forgotten, I did find at length The wonder of a new immortal strength, And while unkinged the substance of a throne. For in the tender policies of trust And offices of lowliness, but sweet; That moved unmarked in regions pale and pent, Beneath the cloud and through the grey blind dust; By daily washing of the beggars' feet, I had regained the grand Lost Sacrament. GOD'S LOVE. It is not only air we breathe, Who are hung in the awful Space Where the clouds and the stars enwreathe, And we rest in the Father's face. But the Infinite love, below, above, Laps us in its tender arms; And as infants we lie, and live and die Wrapt round from the thorny harms. For each inspiration is His salvation, That heedless and blind we draw; And the rapture felt is a revelation Divine, and its goodly law. It is not only meat we take, As we merrily dine and drink; While our destiny we unmake, If in grovelling sense we sink. But the Infinite love, below, above, Gives all of us daily bread; And we fatten and feed, in every need, Of food on His table spread. For our answered wishes are God's good dishes Whereon we in plenty fare, If they come in guise of sweet flesh or fishes And attest His boundless care. THE ONE BEAUTIFUL. My Beautiful, my Best, my All, To whom I dimly grope With each ascent, by every fall, In the blue heaven of hope. Unutterably far, and yet Divinely true and near, With the deep thunders of the worlds beset Though orbèd in a tear. Through universes in my dreams I toil, I climb for ages Which are but passing pages, Amid the stars in dazzling streams, Amid a host of harms; I wander as a baby blind, To wake in blessedness and find Myself within Thy arms. I feel Thy breath upon my cheek, And chastened to my stroking— Made exquisitely mild and meek Thy face, which I for ever seek By altars darkly smoking; I gather to my breast that Grace, Which while the majesty of Space I prize most when provoking. I cannot see Thee, yet I gaze Right clearly in those Eyes So more than human with the haze Of passion's purple skies; I cannot touch Thy Hand, but still It is not coldly far At any hour, and after scorching ill It softens the rude scar. And sometimes in the happy night, In pretty primrose weather, We play sweet games together Betwixt the shadow and the light; And lowly to me bent I taste the mercy of Thy Mouth, Like balmy breezes of the south, Each kiss a sacrament. And at the meeting of our lips, Which is a solemn sainting, The fire burns to my finger tips With joy of earthquake and eclipse, Beyond a poet's painting; And with Thy gloriousness I mix, While all my being's bars unfix In ecstasies past fainting. My Beautiful, my Best, my One, My Father, who hast smil'd Upon this workmanship foredone, O Thou Eternal Child! Great Treasure of all Space and Time, Filling the cosmic throne Which sends its rays on every creed and clime, And yet my God alone. Dear Soul of Sorrow, and the Joy That sets the planets rolling And is their curb controlling, But yet my humblest tool and toy And closest kith and kin! I only lose Thee, when I let This dreadful dower of spirit forget Its high estate for sin. And when temptation's spoiling spear Falls with a sharp surprising, Then in my deafness Thou dost hear, Betwixt the trembling faith and fear, And art my re-arising; For all the furious furnace heats Prove in the end Thy bosom beats, Won if by agonising. I often seek in Thee some speck From jealous heed of duty, As on the columned lily's neck A hidden flaw in beauty; But though I strive with utmost cares To track a tiny spot, And sometimes seem to catch Thee unawares— I do discern it not. What were a stain to mortals, makes For Thee but comely dresses And perfect lovelinesses, Whereof my blemished life partakes And waxes with Thee grand; I warm me in the wondrous flame, Which thrills and compasses the frame Of every sea and land. I fancy like me none is quite To thee a child as tender, If in all suffering washed and white, Or fashioned of the Infinite And girded with its splendour; O Thou to none, however good, As to my gentle hardihood, Hast given Thy whole surrender. THE COSMOS. Why has God clothed with terrible sweet joy And awful beauty This earth of ours, that is the children's toy Yet does its duty? For while the cosmic wheels go rolling on Machine-wise, mighty, They give a Bable or a Babylon Or the white wonder of the Parthenon And Aphrodite; Yea, though they are for ever grinding, grinding As grist the planets With Johns and Janets, Through orbs and individuals winding, winding Their systemed cycles, and the centuries pass And grow as lightly as the summer grass Civilisations And populations, With newer cults and fears and nobler creeds, Which answer to the pulse of broader needs; Yet do they touch the springs of inmost being Where blessed knowledge is the same as seeing Beyond all stricture, And on a common ground of one agreeing They make a picture. He was not bound to mete a building fair And glad with glory, As He hath richly garmented in air Of blue clerestory This world and all the universes' eaves And starry hanging, That with the æons form and fade as leaves And fruit and then are gathered up as sheaves Through shadowed panging; He was not forced with kindly tending, tending, To paint us yellow Gold and its fellow The buttercup, and in soft blending, blending, To mix with subtlest graces, hopes and hues— A freewill offering and with heavenly clues— And pour a fragrance On wild weeds' vagrance, Or lavish wealth of curves and cunning forms And fashion comely the rude strife and storms. They do not help the pistons' measured beating, Or add a morsel to His furnace heating By pretty dresses; And yet God scatters far, not once repeating, His lovelinesses. He might have cast an ugly evil shape Of clay and granite, And not have finished even one purple grape Though He began it; He might have framed us just a monstrous mill With iron forges, Which manufactured blindly good and ill Impartially, and left no room for will In sunless gorges. He might have thrown His engines' panting, panting, Down with no sweetness On our unmeetness, Without a throb of pleasure's chanting, chanting; And scribbled not a bird upon the sky Nor scattered flower and wing of butterfly And cushioned mosses Among our crosses, That lift us by their charms most gently up And turn each bud a sacramental cup. But out of all the many gifts and choices He in His bounty dealt us singing voices Beyond small stricture, And moulded earth that laughs and still rejoices A perfect picture. SECTION VI. The Prisoner of Eternity. THE PRISONER OF ETERNITY. God in His lonely Being, God in His awful might, Hungered at last for fleeing out of excessive Light. Sole with His solemn greatness high above joy and grief, Grim in august sedateness, weary He wished relief. Cold was the bliss that entered none but His boundless Life, Dreadful when all Self-centred, stirred not by any strife. Terrible grew the prison made by His perfect lot, Where not a cloud had risen yet nor one splendid spot. Vain seemed the endless ages, turning alone for Him Still the unblotted pages never a tear could dim. There by His own election sealed in a sacred calm Shutting out less affection, sadly He sought a balm. Gaunt was that dread privation touched by no tempest rude, Ghastly the condemnation dooming to solitude; Starving amid the glory binding Him captive in, Hearing the eternal story pure from it's fellow sin, Darkly He drew the fulness round His unruffled Heart Walled though Divine with dulness, dwelling in peace apart. Horrible grew the brightness shared not nor shadowed yet, Robing His one uprightness round with a sun unset; Cursed was the lot and fateful—but to be so employed, Crushing Him down and hateful all because unalloyed. Therefore He oped the portal letting His grandeur out, Making the creature mortal wrapt with His Life about; Tired of the ages endless, calm that no ripple broke, He from His summits friendless thus in the silence spoke: “It is a burden I can hardly bear, A crown My Head is weary now to wear, Which never from a set beginning rose And never may find refuge in a close, Though centuries on centuries roll by— This dreadful boon of all Eternity. No time existed, when I was not still The same One God with one same iron will Supreme, resistless, in unchanging might And loneness of intolerable Light, At once My dungeon and My glorious dress Of bliss profound and beauty merciless, Augustly perfect and serenely sole The Life of life and yet Myself the Whole. From everlasting I was just the same, Incomprehensible, the fount and frame Of all alike, the Last as well as First Self-centred and sufficient with no thirst From lack of any good, above the need That wreaks itself in poetries of deed, Beyond the pulse of passion in My store Of absolute abundance, never more Endowed than I could ask for, never less, In awful joy of uncompanionedness. This is My trouble, that I cannot cease From happiness and unabated peace Without a bar or pause or petty cloud, In the great shining Home that is My shroud; I fret against the tyranny of years So fruitful with no equipoise of fears, No background and no shadow and no sky To break the prison of Eternity. The overflowing cup, the boundless range Of rest and gladness with no chime of change, Oppress Me in My solitary throne With the fixed measure of their monotone; I am a burden to Myself, though bright And beautiful is all in sound and sight, Yet incomplete in its completeness orbed Which has each gift and every grace absorbed, And turned to bondage from the sheer excess Of joy and peace and perfect holiness; And, from this dreary plenitude of Power, I crave for want within My fearful dower. The need of nothing is the sorest need To One who is the blossom and the seed Of universal Being, and at call Has whatsoe'er He seeks since He is All, And cannot gain what He does not possess In the broad circle of that Blessedness Where æons are the only hours that strike, The Centre and Circumference alike Of the grand Sum, the Fountainhead and stream The Light of light, the Dreamer and the dream. Beneath the weight and wonder of the joy That has no limit and no kind alloy, I pine for mortal change, if but a breath, And the sweet mercy of a moment's death. But yet I must pursue the pathway trod, For I may nowise other be than God Or step outside Myself; for if I did What My own law and destiny forbid, And should exceed the uttermost dim bond That binds Me in, it were Myself beyond; And this My glory also is My curse, I am the Slave of My own universe Who must for ever and for ever be Author and outcome both, and cannot flee From any part or lot that is not Mine, Enchained in this imprisonment Divine. I am resolved to put forth fresher bloom And make of Mine some new adaptive doom With fair creations in an ordered sphere, Where man and leaf shall flourish and turn sere By generations' gradual rise and fall, And birth succeeded by the solemn pall, With kind relief for every soul at length, In intermissions of surcease and strength; That in their languors of allotted sleep I too may drink the cup of poppies deep, And reap in breaking of each human tie A reflex rest, though God can never die.” God in His glorious prison shadowless, where no shape Mortal had yet arisen, hungered for some escape. Then on the unseen forges, moulding His mighty plan Hidden in mountain gorges, God to create began; Took of His own great Being beautiful, pure and white, Touched it with inward seeing wonderful, infinite; Rifled His own sweet Bosom even of perfect joy, Mingled the noontide blossom then with the night's alloy; Gave with a father's blessing bright as the spring's young morn Other and sharp caressing felt in the flower-hid thorn; Mixed with the love for leaven sorrow to work as ban, Fear but with hope as heaven, making His fellow man. God from His weary splendour high on the mountain cup, Bade by His Self-surrender image of Him start up; Clothed him with His own thunder garb, while the sacred fire Leapt at His Will and under kindled divine desire; Fashioned him fair with beauty hugging the beast as foil, Sowed in him seed of duty blooming in blessed toil; Formed in His likeness kneading godhead and earthly dust, Building him broad and leading on through ascents of trust; Poured in his every motion's music a kingly grace, Crowning him with devotion's dew on the upturned face; Added to His dear creature all the Immortal can, Passion and angel feature, making His plaything man. God in His changeless bounding breathed in His scapegoat breath, Fenced in by frail surrounding rich with the dower of death; Set him on earth as victim decked with the roses' chains, Chosen but to afflict him thus with vicarious pains: Turned him adrift and loaded still with a mortal freight Weakness to ruin goaded, easing His own sad weight; Tempted him mocked with blindness set in his very law; Scourged but in helpful kindness till he in suffering saw: Starved him when madly driven out from a plenteous place, Stayed him in deserts riven sore with exceeding Grace; Framed him through stormy trials meant as His winnowing fan Stronger by stern denials, making His servant man. God in eternal soleness seeking a salve and kin, Out of His awful wholeness shuddering looked on Sin; Gazed on the evil shadow dogging His tool and toy, Blight on the greenest meadow, blot in the gentlest joy; Bathed in the lava glowing flesh He had softly knit, Turned to the tempest blowing nerves that were all unfit; Hedged the poor lot with thistles, fed it on stones for bread, Harrowed with iron bristles life like a silken thread; Scattered in Love the sorrow He never yet might share, Though He would gladly borrow ills that His creature bare; While He bestowed the resting change and a mortal plan Grudged for His own investing—making His failure man. “Lo, it is done, and yet I hunger more Within the boundless riches of My store Which is Infinity, for kindly rest To drop in drowsy might upon this Breast, Which of the oceans that around Me lie Seeks for some pity that will let it die, And cannot gain the portion of the brute, To live its little hour and then be mute. I have beheld the ages passing by Beneath My footstool, and new earth and sky Made and unmade and giving place to fresh, Which each dissolved in turn its cunning mesh For others and still others as they came From the one womb of whirling cloud and flame, To pass through pomp of universal life By growing stages of all fruitful strife, And play with pistons of a cosmic breath Ere dwindling down to universal death; And then once more from the great funeral Of Night supreme and aboriginal Resume on larger scales the mystic dance And ever young and ever old romance Of suns and moons and systems in their bound, Waxing and wanning as they circled round, And brake like foam of phosphorescent wave On Me their Architekton and their grave. Millennia on millennia now have gone, While constellations set that proudly shone For times and seasons past all earthly tale, And world on world has brightened and turned pale Though I abode and never might grow less In the grim circuit of Almightiness. Ah, I have seen in rhythmic glare and gloom Strange fates and banqueted on death and doom Myself unmoved, and in this vast decay Yet could not from My dungeon flee away, And this Self-wrought and Self-determined lot Which shuts Me in to splendour without spot And immortality. For in the range Of countless forms I only could not change, Or briefly darken to a gracious close And snatch one minute of denied repose, While all things else knew their appointed end And found in death a saviour and a friend, Descending into silence and the dust To rise again with more refulgent trust. But wherefore could not I, who needed most Some respite, for a while desert My post And slumber in the tomb a certain space For resurrections of Diviner Grace? Death rolled around a multitudinous sea Of shapeless shadows, but refused My plea For mercy while its surges came and went And gulfed the kingdom and the continent, With wan eclipse so infinitely sweet And bathed in furious impotence My feet, That might not yield to its corroding wrath And still paced on their dreary millround path Embraced by Me and yet abhorred as well, The Heaven that in its changelessness is hell. For I alone mid all My creature things That ebb and flow in ceaseless perishings And re-appearings, I alone endure The shock and shelter of the end secure And soft oblivion which to these may give Fair funeral for a time while I must live. I am most weary of the unruffled calm That brings to Me no compensating balm In blank persistence, while around, below, Creation marches to its overthrow Through superstructions rising tier on tier From mysteries of bridal to the bier; And I who thirst to have a kindred share With these in sweetness of a common care And draw delicious streams of rapture thence, Am crushed beneath My own magnificence Which still abides the same, no less, no more, Though Death beats on Me as on iron shore Beat the white breakers that have beat since Time First woke the madness of their measured chime. O if I could to nothing now resolve My Being, who for others may evolve A portion and a bound and then unmake The vast machines that at My Will awake, I were most willing to achieve that rest Which lies like music on the maiden's breast Or rocks the roosting bird upon the Deep, And though not death is its own fellow sleep. But yet for Me in all uncharted Space No death can ever find a dwelling-place, Nor its dear shadow; I go living on, Without the pity dealt to Babylon Or universal Rome, whose swords are rust, Whose palaces are but a pinch of dust. I feed, I fill the myriad worlds that pass Like clouds a moment mirrored on the grass, And richly grant in happiness or grief The destined lots and lines of fixed relief; Which I may nowise take Myself, who move Amid the pleasures that I cannot prove, And shall for ever range beneath this dome Of splendid sorrow with no final home, While system after system billows by, The hopeless Prisoner of Eternity.” THE BOOK OF BANE. Stand upon Ebal, Lord, baring the judgment sword; Curse with avenging need, curse all the powers of Greed. This is the Book of Bane— Hear what the Heavens ordain, Hear the unaltered curse Cast on the Spoiler's purse Builded of crime and greed, Growing by lives that bleed Under the sweater's pall Woven of bitter need; Hear the abiding curse Cast on his house and all, Sparing not babe or nurse, Blasting them in one fall Mingled of mire and pain— This is the Book of Bane. This is the Book of Bane— Cursèd be he in gain Wrung from his drudges' throes Out of their daily woes; Cursèd his cruel breath Fed by their living death, Scorning the One who died Jesus of Nazareth; His be the victims' throes Heard not howe'er they cried, His be the inward foes Gnawing a nature wried, Horror and leper stain— This is the Book of Bane. This is the Book of Bane, Making his toil in vain; Cursèd be he in store Gathering hourly more But for the spendthrift's hand, But for the canker's brand, But for the mocker's part, Heaped as a tower of sand; Cursèd be he in store, Cursèd his haunted heart Bearing what others bore Crushed by his evil art, Bearing their pangs again— This is the Book of Bane. This is the Book of Bane— Hear what the Heavens ordain; Cursèd be he with gloom Clouding the bridal room, Laid on his dying life, Hung with the judgment knife Over his path in shame, Breeding the rot of strife; Cursèd be he with gloom, Shadow of fear and flame Shed by the creeping doom; Cursèd his kin and name, Bound in one blighting chain— This is the Book of Bane. Stand upon Ebal, Lord, baring the judgment sword; Curse with avenging need, curse all the powers of Greed. THE BOOK OF BLESSING. Stand on Gerizim, Lord, sheathing the judgment sword; Bless all abounding love, bless from Thy founts above. This is the Book of Blessing— Hear what the Heavens to thee, Lover of man decree Now amid passions pressing, Laughter and love's caressing, Gifts that in grace agree; Honour and praise they give, Gladness whereby we live, Kingdom of hope and calm Fixed and not fugitive; Always a shading palm Cool when the heat is pressing, Always the breath of balm— This is the Book of Blessing. This is the Book of Blessing— Light in the darkest home, Light from the sacred tome Shed by white souls' confessing, Kindled by no vain guessing Under a godless dome; Blessèd be thou in toil Garnering wheat and oil, Blessèd in body and mind Rich with a golden spoil, Blessèd to loose or bind Others who come confessing And without thee were blind— This is the Book of Blessing. This is the Book of Blessing— Laded with wealth for thee, Helper of hearts that flee Straight to thy strong redressing, Sick with their sore distressing, Safe from the realms unfree; Blessed be thou in price Paid for the pleasant spice Poured by thy service sweet, Blessèd in sacrifice Offered at those pure feet Tribute for thy redressing, Recompense not unmeet— This is the Book of Blessing. This is the Book of Blessing— Hear what the Heavens assign Out of their bliss benign Over our dim transgressing, Meed beyond man's assessing, Dew of a strength Divine; Blessèd be thou to heal Brothers who have no weal, Saving the friendly tomb Yawning to seize and seal; Blessèd in fruitful womb, And above all transgressing Life in its honey-comb— This is the Book of Blessing. Stand on Gerizim, Lord, sheathing the judgment sword; Bless all abounding love, bless from thy founts above. AN EASTER HYMN. The voice of resurrection thou, Poised on that purple stair Which carries stars upon its brow, Bright angel of the air; O bathed in beauty and in Heaven Which thou hast ever trod, Thy music has a holy leaven And mingles all with God; To thee no riddle can be dark, Sweet tenant of the sky Which is thy dwelling-place, thou spark Of true Divinity. O lovely voice, O lonely Bird, Thou drawest us on high Till every pulse with joy is stirr'd And Paradise brought nigh; The chambers of the rolling Space Are redolent of thee, As though our common Father's face Undazzled thou dost see, And waft the fragrance of His Love Upon that wondrous wing In silver spray from founts above, O thou eternal Spring. Thy song disperses each gray doubt Forbidding hope to fly, Till hearts of prison broaden out Into infinity; And faded faiths that had been dead In cold misgivings' gloom, Awaked by thee lift up their head Again and bud and bloom; Thou walkest on the waves of sound And glory is thy dress, Thy life is light without a bound, Dear everlastingness. Thy message drops as soft as dew And is immortal youth, For ever old, for ever new, For ever one with Truth; And though thy nest is but a clod Amid the humble stones, The breath of the most awful God Breathes through thy burning tones; The promise of all worlds to thee For us in mercy came, Earth and the better earth to be, O thou incarnate flame. HOW BEAUTIFUL. O God, beyond all praises' breath, How beautiful Thou art! How marvellous in life and death, And haunting to the heart! I cannot hide away from Thee Nor would I if I might, For into darkness did I flee Thou wert the shadowed night. Thine hour-glass is the sandy shore, Thy cruse the dreadful deep, Thy footsteps pace for evermore The silent heaven of sleep. The lily with its virgin pose Is fragrant with Thy grace, And reverence sees in every rose A glimmer of Thy Face. A broken mirror one may be, The midnight and the morn, But yet a mirror each of Thee— The blossom and the thorn. The tree that takes a frosty hue Beneath the stormy strife, Is something more, it doth endue A fragment of Thy Life. The bridal chamber reddening up, To meet the fruitful kiss Of honey-bee in honey-cup, Is blushing with Thy Bliss. I mark the waving of Thy dress, Which covers all the globe, Alike in weeds' unprettiness And poppies' scarlet robe. The leaf that lisps its tender tale Draws music from Thy Voice, Which thunders in the shouting gale When winds and waves rejoice. The thought to cradle me is Thine And rocks the sleeping land, And in the fray from Thee Divine I touch Thy human Hand. The thirsty grass that gathers rain Of Thy free table sips, And in the nettle's blessed pain I only feel Thy Lips. The gold dust on the insect's wings, The moment of the mite, Though both are as a jarring string, With Thee are infinite. O God, my wonder cannot guess What half Thy grandeurs be, Thou universal Loveliness Who findest room for me. MY GARDEN. Ye beeches fashioned by the storms, Ye solemn oaks So gnarled and twisted into demon forms Through which the sunlight soaks In summer, and ye guardian pines That build a barrier to the northern blast, Earth-fast, Whereby it scarce can find an entry— That stand in stubborn lines, Like God's great peace as sentry; Ye are my kin And playmates, and one common shadow falls As of a common sin On me and on your sheltering walls. Ye are my friends, And ye and I Grow still beneath the same blue equal sky, And to no different ends Put forth the shoots of tender trust From dust And darkness, into the sweet air To clothe and make our bodies fair And something better than the clod, And feed the heart Of man and life so close apart, Not for ourselves but God. We wrestle Both with the winter winds and catch And cling unto each other, Or softly sleep and dimly nestle And each as with a brother Under the twilight in the cool and calm, And breathe in balm That silence cannot smother One evening psalm Unto the same dear Heaven that bows In blessing on our languid brows. Ye are my teachers too, Wise with the hoary lessons of the past Which prophets vainly woo Until to you as children sent at last. I learn From yellow pages of your lichened boles, The path of pilgrim souls; What sufferings earn By cross and loss and bitter bindings, And daily losings that are findings; What sin, Which makes us all akin, Has wrought with cruel moulding And serpentine enfolding, By which we thrive Or do decay And pass away To rise renewed once more and re-alive; What love, The general pulse, the general law Of crooning dove And snowy maid With love's new light and living awe Impassioned and afraid, Has turned to music and to song That rolls the happy world along. I read And reap from your dear mossy books The elemental forces of the mind, That knead And lead From dusky nooks Sweet natures blind, To studies of the laughing brooks And wisdom of the travelled wind. Ye are my house, My clothing and my bread, Shared with the flitting moth and mouse And song-birds overhead. Yes, in your greenery of gloom So soft and spacious, So glad and gracious, I with my cares and fantasies find room For all their features, And blighted feelings bloom That hid like wounded creatures In shadow, and again take shape And in their freedom from their wounds escape. The manna of your dew and scent Is heavenly food For every mood, And fulness of a deep content. But in the evening comes the Master down To see His garden, as of old, And then each tree in dainty gown Before Him bends its green and gold And lays its crown Of praise and wonder, And murmurs from the leaf-hid mould That He may pass in peace thereunder. And I, Who see Him not but only guess That He is beautiful and nigh And comes to bless, Yet mix my loyal sigh With yours and melt into His Loveliness. Dear Trees, My sole companions, my sole friends, When life has settled on the lees That nothing mends, In you I find The sympathy I seek Soft on my cheek And medicine to my troubled mind; There is a sanctuary in your sod That feels no Fall, And safe within your arms that call I walk with God. And ye, my flowers, In architectured piles and orders Obedient to your ivied borders, That weave me bowers Of pink and purple, white and red, Spilled over every spacious bed In broad profusion— Ye are dear In all the depths of your Divine seclusion, From russet stem to starry tear That glistens High on some blue or crimson cup, And gathers up Deep in its tiny cell Serenely curl'd As in a fairy crucible The grace and glory of the whole wide world. Ye maiden flowers in pretty frocks, My lady-smocks And goldylocks, I know The passion and the glow That through your veins with summer flow; Ye hollyhocks, My sentinels, that stand on guard And brave the tempests when they blow, However scarr'd; I feel the spirit in my measure That breathes through you and is life's treasure And gives the sadness With the gladness Bound up in one white flame of pleasure, And drinks of mirth and drinks of madness. While far below you at your feet Upon the misty plain The murmurous city—street on street Stands out a yellow stain. But all its spires And splendid towers With all enchantments of the olden hours, That burnt like fires Their memoried scrawls On scarpèd walls, Are not to me one half as fair As lightest air That whispers round your fairy home, Or magic sun's Bright beam that runs From root to petal And makes each bloom a dazzling dome Of precious metal. For ye have suffering souls like mine And are Divine, And your Divinity Breaks out in scarlet blushes, Beneath the butterfly; And in a verdure of intense virginity Riots and rushes Beyond the haze That bounds my gaze Out in the awful ocean of Infinity; And in blue weather Upon that shore, We play together And garner little sheaves of lore, Or drink of the great common store Tied by one tether Of living love, Which holds when lesser bonds go by And links the gardener and his lush foxglove One with each other and Eternity. And O innumerous bees, That haunt my flowers and trees And chant your chimes Among the limes, And take the honey Your own as well as mine, To make me wine Of joy that is not bought with money; Throughout the times of history hums The drowsy music of your drums, A ceaseless roll That murmurs all the ages round And all their riper sweetness sums, Upon the ever-lengthening scroll Of happy sound, When thunder claps of war that toll To ruin and to death are drown'd. O garden bright With borrowed light, Reflected still from Eden's bowers And watered with its shining showers, Thy bosom vernal Or summer-clad With trees and flowers and emerald sod, Is but a shadow of the eternal Sweet Paradise so green and glad, Wherein hereafter I shall walk with God. “NOT A SPARROW,” Etc. Not a sparrow Ever to the earth can fall, But the Father hears its call; Not an arrow Of a prayer is shot on high, But that wondrous Love is nigh Which doth count each hair and all. Not a blossom Of a lily may be torn, But the Father feels the thorn; Not a bosom May be stabbed with cruel fear, But His Mercy holds the spear, Who Himself to pain was born. Not a bleating Of a lamb upon the wind, But the Father makes this kind; Not a heating Of a furnace comes with woe, But He first each fiery throe Tasted ere we walked behind. Not a shadow Drops without the Father's will, Who takes thought of oxen still; Not a meadow Cries with fading flowers for rain, But He knows the weary chain And creation's lightest ill. Not one little Tear or trouble is so small, But the Father notes its thrall; Not a tittle Of a story no one hears, But is music to His ears Who is as our Temple wall. Not the straying Of a baby's feet in night, But the Father metes some light; Not the playing Of a butterfly or bee, But His eyes in pity see Who is all our sun and sight. Not a burden Presses on the back of care, Which the Father does not share; Not a guerdon, If of gladness or of grief, Wherein He is not the chief Who our sins and sorrows bare. Not a stable Or a wild where cattle feed But the Father helps their need Not a table For His creatures' meal is spread, But that Presence is their Bread Which alone is Food indeed. Not a sparrow Waves in want its tiny wings, But unto the Father clings; Not a narrow Nest or portion lowly laid, But He giveth each His aid Who is Father of all things. “CONSIDER THE LILIES.” Look at the lilies How they grow in perfect form and face, And prove what excellence that Will is Which gave such faultless grace; They toil not as we must, dear brothers, And never need they spin Their weary lives away like others, And then new tasks begin; For beauty Is their simple duty, To feed on sun and air Or bend their lips to every bidder And hourly wax more fair— And hourly wax more fair. Sweet Heart, the World is a sweet bidder, And thou dost daily bloom and grow As fair as lilies are, but O “Consider.” Look at the lilies, How they grow in poetry of power And praise therewith the One whose Will is That everything should flower; They toil not, yet no king of story Was ever clothed like them, In garb of fire and dew and glory, And spotless diadem; For pleasing Saddened eyes and easing The troubled soul of man And smiling on the boldest bidder, Is their appointed plan— Is their appointed plan. Sweet Heart, the flesh is a sweet bidder And vain would break thy virgin vow Which married thee to Christ, but now “Consider.” Look at the lilies How they grow in seemliness of shape, And magnify the Hand whose Will is A love that none escape; They toil not, yet their robes are scarlet, And nowise need they spin Those pretty frocks at night so starlit That are to light akin; For shining Only and inclining Their wealth to those that woo, And breathing honey on each bidder Is all the work they do— Is all the work they do. Sweet Heart, the Devil is a bidder, And daily thou dost send more far The fragrance of thy life, but ah! “Consider.” Look at the lilies, How they grow in purity of dress And bear the Teacher's law whose Will is A life of holiness; They toil not on our dreary stages, They till no grudging ground Which gives them all, and not for wages, And hold one happy round; For serving Others, and not swerving From what God first ordained, Or paying tithe to every bidder, Is in their lot engrained— Is in their lot engrained. Sweet Heart, thy sin is a sweet bidder, With soft delights to lay thee low And dash thy lily bloom, but O “Consider.” LAYING THE FOUNDATIONS. “The Blood of the Martyrs is the Seed of the Church.” Lo, among the mean and meagre structures of a sterile art Came the Architekton, eager with the measures in His heart Of a great and goodly Building which would last and laugh and shine In a glory for no gilding to make meeter or refine. And He spake— “Come, bring me metal Purer than the white snow-flake, Gold as yellow as the petal Of the buttercup's gold breast; And of treasure at My pleasure all your silver hoards and best; And of timber and of stone, Whatever may become my throne.” So they brought Him of their rarest riches what their hands had won, Precious gems, and marbles fairest, freshly quarried, grandly done, And they laid them as a present at the Architekton's feet, Till the whole wide land seemed pleasant with their comeliness and sweet. And they spake— “Behold the beauty, As of virgin flowers that brake Out beneath the steps of duty When it trod the martyr's path, And the blessing of caressing earth redeemed the murderer's wrath; Here is masonry, and store Of choicest things—what would'st thou more?” Then the Architekton graciously accepted all their gifts, For the Building must be spaciously upreared and with no rifts And no blank of imperfection in its splendour full and soft, Springing like the resurrection of a ransomed world aloft. But He spake Again in weeping— “Ah, the House I cannot make Yet without a bitter steeping Of its bases in the flood, Which is given by the riven hearts of servants and their blood; Ye have lent what labour hives, But now I want your noblest lives.” So the purest of the preachers in the silence and the shade With the wisest among teachers, as the awful summons bade, Flocked and with no thought of trembling in the greatest or the least To the hallowed ground assembling as unto a marriage feast. And they spake— “We come, O Master, Gladly, quickly, for Thy sake, Proud to bear the last disaster As delight and due to Thee, Who hast finely and divinely fashioned us so strong and free; We obey Thy solemn call, And here we lay ourselves and all.” Then the Architekton raising high the body of His thought Built the saintly souls, that praising Him waxed lovelier as He wrought Them and their supreme oblation to a texture strange and new From a perfect consecration, in His Will which outward grew. And He spake— “My children dying Thus with dearer charms awake And in forms that are not flying, Merged within a broader ken; For the nations' firm foundations are the holy lives of men; And for every conquering creed, The blood must be the vital seed.” So the Building with that leaven and the red baptismal dew Leapt like fire abroad to Heaven and on wings of wonder flew, Waxing brighter with the ages, and illuming dark and dearth With the glory of its pages, till it overshadowed earth. But none spake Good words or pondered, Though they greedy were to take All the priceless jewels squandered On their bases of all bliss; Though they cared not, and they spared not hearts that only bled for this; And none heeded, or would know Who were the martyrs laid below. THE GREAT SILENCE (FRAGMENT). “There was Silence in Heaven.” — Rev. viii. I. The great white Throne was planted, and the God Whose robe is thunder and who bears the rod Of judgment with the books of life and ban, Who is our Brother and our Fellow man, Sat thereupon; and men were gathered round, Nations on nations, worlds beyond a bound, Innumerable kingdoms and the climes Of peoples from all places and all times Since earth began, and to the utmost end To which creations from their cradles tend Through birth and fruitful dying. There the Throne Was fixed, and on it set the Judge alone In dreadful might and majesty, though not From wrath and ruin that had been a blot Or violence and fear, but in the awe Of unimagined love that was His law. And yet the terror of the Love so pure Smote like a fire which no one could endure With its great wealth of holiness. But He, Who looked throughout all time that was to be And had been, spoke no single word of good Or evil; while in hush beneath Him stood The generations out of every stage Of earth and open as a printed page; As, in the silence like a brooding dove, He weighed them in the balances of Love. L' HOMME MACHINE.—EGO, EGO ANIMUS. L'homme machine. Freewill is nothing but a poet's dream, Or fraud of paid professors Who sit as false assessors And hope with straws to stay the cosmic stream; But still the engine's piston and the wheels Hold on their ceaseless mission, And life by bud or fission Or cell and spore its varied thread unreels; There is no God, I just go blankly on And do, as I am driven By the first impulse given, Just what I must, a blind automaton. Ego, ego animus. This heart is soaked in sunrise, and the Spring For ever keeps it vernal, And all the great Eternal Shines through with dreadful overshadowing; I cannot flee from the pursuing God Who is in my own bosom, And makes it fruit and blossom As He can clothe the barest judgment rod; I will not hide my soul in sordid pelf Or place of earthly leaven, I seek my kindred Heaven, I know the awful Maker is Myself. L'homme machine. I am content to go yet grinding out The daily task and measure Of common grief or pleasure, I feel no deathless pulse nor glorious doubt; The universal tide flows through me still From the same dim dumb sources, And I obey the Forces Which in me wreak their unknown unloved will; There is no future and no fairer scene In higher worlds and hidden, I live as we are bidden, I die a broken and ungeared machine. Ego, ego animus. In this broad world I have a final voice, And cherish the true vision, While with a sharp decision I cut the darkest nodes by God-like choice; I feel the stirring of strange wings and powers With wells that bubble over, And bright as light on clover A promise vaster than old Babel's towers; I am no clod resolved at last to dust, I am no pinch of matter To live an hour and chatter, But spirit splendid though in wrack and rust. L'homme machine. I am but the poor product of the sum Of many forms and factors, Amid a thousand actors That dance to ruin with the fife and drum; I may not gain the profit which I plan, When enemies of iron In multitudes environ, I only reap the gleanings as I can; I am a vessel if of clay or gold, Framed in a common fashion And filled with froth of passion That shall not ever pass its crumbling mould. Ego, ego animus. I love and feel the drawing of the tie, Which through all time and weather Joins heart to heart together, I love and so I never now can die; I think but thoughts the Father's breath inspires, And know the farthest fancies Of my most fond romances Are but the echo of His grand desires; I am because He is and He is good And in me manifested, As God the Woman-breasted, The Man incarnate—in all understood. SPLENDIDA SILENTIA. I A woman came to Him, no Israelite, And poured the passion of her infinite Sweet sorrow trembling into unshed tears Of sunrise in the Christ's averted ears. She cried for mercy on herself; for one With her the daughter was, who lay undone And sorely tost, and tortured by the pain Of pressing evil with its awful chain. And still each mother's voice that rises up, To spill its anguished overflowing cup In quest of pity from the brazen sky, Bears all the impress of her agony. She spoke in vain; as from a stony wall Beat back the echo of her idle call And seemed to find no kindly place or part Of home within that universal Heart, Which had no room for her lone bitter cry In its most gentle hospitality. For never word said He, whose word was life, To stay the fever of her inward strife, Which with its tumult tore the mother's breast And made it one sad sea of wild unrest. But in the cloud of splendid silence lay, The lightning Love that yet turned night to day. II Again He met a king the KING uncrowned Himself, and saw the ribald band around That mocked him with the menaces of hate, As futile blasts besiege a palace gate Unopened and unheeded; armèd men Dealt gibes like sword-cuts; and to Herod's ken Came back in crimson mist the prophet breath Of the great Baptist still more great in death, With the dark record rolling out its map And words of judgment each a thunder-clap— Till he remembered. And that figure stood, Withdrawn from him by the whole heaven of good, And sadly gazed in his confounded face In dumb rebuke and all unearthly grace, While grim about Him seethed the baffled wrath Of foes disarmed that could not dim His path To the sublime and certain end. The glare Of kingly pomp to His world-lifting care Seemed but the bauble of a fleeting hour, A thing of shame, the scarlet poppy flower, And faded as He looked. Earth passed Him by, Whose Heart held commune with eternity. Time was a dream, and mean the mighty sword Against the splendid silence of the Lord. III Once more before the judge his Judge supreme He stood in solitary woe extreme, And heard the cruel jests and bare the scorn Of purple robe and the unregal thorn And mimic pomp and bowing head and reed That was His only staff in utter need. The clash of arms went up, fierce lips did raise Rude shouts of homage that were yet not praise, And added greater glory to that lot Which could not take the semblance of a spot, And were but witness to His rightful throne Whereon He judged them all and sat alone. He saw the wolfish eyes so red with lust That longed to stamp His kingdom in the dust, And blast the fair beginnings of new time With blot of black inexpiable crime. Again and yet again with flash of steel And sullen grinding of the iron heel The question rang, the challenge and the cry Of doubt or hate that clamoured for reply But fell as empty sounds upon His ear, To wake no answer of reproach or fear. He wrapt His soul from every storm and stress, In splendid silence like a royal dress. IV And yet, when we fling foolish prayers on high, He answers not in turn, He comes not nigh, But draws the veil around Him closer still Through which we guess but fragments of His will And gather wisdom from the unvoiced speech. O if in haste or passion men beseech Forbidden gifts that were no gain, no joys, But shining shadows or delusive toys, His choicest blessing and our chiefest boon Is the response that sleeps and wakes not soon Or not at all. He talks between the strains Of melody and rhythmic beats of pains, More than in these. And when a fateful gloom Encircles us and visions dark as doom Pursue our steps, and with sealed lips of scorn The mute skies bear no message with the morn Or evening, and we hark and are afraid— It is His sentence awful if unsaid. And though He is the Word and utters loud His trumpet warnings from behind no shroud, Yet speaks He plainest when no sound is heard And in the stillness He is most the Word, Who loves all notes and speaks all languages But dwells among the Splendid Silences. ECCLESIÆ SEMEN. [1895, China.] “The blood of the Martyrs is the Seed of the Church.” Fire not a volley, Strike not a blow Now for the martyrs! Warfare is folly, Blood may not flow; Let not the banner Calling to strife Wave for the Blessèd, who in Christ's manner Offered their life; Let not in thunder Echo a shot Over the harvest red with the plunder, Shaming their lot. This be their beauty, This be their fame Fighting for God, that death was their duty Done without blame; This be their merit Down through the years, Leaving a richer world to inherit, Washed with their tears; This be their glory Far above price, Witnessing truly, telling the story— Love's sacrifice. Here the requiting Vengeance they ask, Grace of forgiving wrongs beyond righting— God's precious task; Here for the blindness Lost in the dark Hope's retribution, hope's human kindness Bringing the Ark; Here is the paying Meet for such debt, More of our praises, more of our praying, More giving yet. Leave all the sentence, Not to mere man, Only to Him who granting repentance Sees the whole plan; Leave all the madness, Murder and need Only to Him who ever in sadness Soweth the seed; Leave the dear Martyrs— Breaking hard sod Thus by their dying, winning us charters— Safely with God. REGAINED IN GOD. Dear God, it seems so passing strange, I should presume to be Partaker of Thy bounteous change and its o'er brimming sea; And take from Thee for every hour the riches I love best, A world, a woman, or a flower a moment on the breast; And clothe me from Thy wardrobe large beneath the blessed sky, Or toy with pebbles on the marge of old Eternity; And at Thy common table feed on beauty, and rare food That satisfies each selfish need and most imperious mood; And drink of fountains pure and bright which at Thy footsteps play, Or leap in glory from the night of Thy exceeding day; And yet give less than nothing back to Thee Who givest all, Save just the refuse and the wrack of some half-sorrowed fall. Dear God, it never can be right or justly dared and done To warm my life in boundless Light and offer to Thee none; I were the meanest basest thing, upon Thy wealth to draw And mix it with a muddy spring or serve a lower law; I am not worthy of the name that reckons me as man, To follow my own shade and shame and use Thy nobler plan. O if I breathe this vital air and bask in heaven's blue rift, Or gather bloom of all things fair—let me confess Thy gift. The sweetness and the joy that flow through every channel fine, From Thee the glamour and the glow reflect and are divine, I cannot, will not flout Thee more; whate'er I have or be, I give myself, my heart, my store—to find again in Thee. UPWARD. No upward yearning yet was lost, no smallest dream can die; Eternity, each moment crost, doth still about us lie; The humblest motion of devotion Is purchased at tremendous cost and links with golden tie; Which fastens to the feet of God the tendrils that we spread; For had He not before us trod, our spirit were but dead. No thought, that struggles to be free and puts forth any bud Or would look out and simply see (beyond the mist and mud That gather dimmer) just a glimmer, Shall ever on unfruitful flee as aimless idle scud; And though behind it hardly leave a trace and faintly sings, It shall return some day at eve with blessing on its wings. One upward craving for blue sky and larger purer air; One pulse of pinions that would fly unto God's starry stair, In feeblest flutter of an utter Need, is an immortality akin to all things fair; For we can only be the shape which would within us grow, And if the secret spell escape no Heaven can through us flow. Each groping effort full and fond hath somewhere answer true, And somehow is itself a bond that shall receive its due; And from this tangle life and wrangle Points out to perfect rest beyond, and clasps the hidden clue; Than earth more solid have I found the slightest hope for good, Which touches God who stands around as He has ever stood. GOD IS MY CANDLE. I see my brothers groping still among the shades, that shine For me who have no private will and catch the gleam divine; But whether it be dusk or day both ever are akin, And still I walk a sunlit way and have the light within; I am not dark in deepest night of broadest creed or ken, And if the stars have taken flight God is my candle then. I hear the murmur of the hour, as others follow beams Which burst in scornful scarlet flower to fade as dying dreams; The tumult of the passing crowd that cannot pause to pray, Tricked by the lure of learning's cloud and its pale wrecker's ray Devoid of duty and the love illuming minds of men; While out of silence from above God is my candle then. I know the earth with all its care has many a burning torch, That guides with meretricious glare to error's pleasant porch, Through gloom that in its evil arms would snuff the glory out And bury beauty's venal charms in rolling seas of doubt; But yet the shadow of despair waits like a ghostly wen, And in the ruin past repair God is my candle then. I feel at times a curtain fall athwart the holiest lamp, And on the cloister's solemn wall eclipse's ghastly stamp; The world without becomes one blot wailed through with mocking wind, And earth a hopeless tangled knot that nothing can unbind; But O within a sudden flame that is the light of ten Leaps in my heart, and at His name God is my candle then. THE HOLY SATAN. I in my palace lowly, I at this dreadful task Sealed to a service holy still for no helper ask; Mine is the ceaseless doing, work that no other can, Sadly by watch and wooing always to strengthen man; Only to build him stronger up by my tempting art, Fashioned as times wax longer more to the perfect part. God may not take my portion, God will not suffer so Blackened by base distortion, bearing my ceaseless woe. But for His will I labour daily and nightly worse, He has the trump and tabor, I the perpetual curse; Multitudes damn and doubt me grovelling at His throne, He incomplete without me leaves me to drudge alone. Not for myself I weary on as the ages roll, Chained to an office dreary, gathering tithe and toll; But by these circuits fateful grinding His measures out, All for a King ungrateful bringing the goal about. Troubled the toil and endless, bitter its means and ways, While I pursue a friendless path with no cheering rays; Doomed to unthankful living breathed through my agents rude, Fed on my death, and giving me but a solitude. Continents form and crumble, systems arise and go, Types by the thousand stumble down in the shifting show; Nature has clouds that dim it, the heavens and earth their range; I have no settled limit known, and I never change. God in His awful distance wanteth my ghostly art, Would not possess existence ever from me apart; Each has the need of other unto the close of time, I am His foe and brother, one in the cosmic chime. Mine is the sombre shadow haunting the homes of night, Spread upon mount and meadow His is the laughing light; I am the evil dwelling grimly in creature things, He is the goodness welling forth from eternal springs. Yet to a far-off marriage reaching through right and ill, Wrong and oblique miscarriage, both are inspiring still; Both do prepare the morrow hinted by sun and moon, I by the sin and sorrow, He with a brighter boon. I am His partner lowly bearing the burden's heat, Bound by a purpose holy—He has the ruler's seat. I along roads erratic sleeplessly moulding man Win not his Peace Sabbatic, but universal ban. Joy cometh nowise near me hungry for human bliss, Mortals if using fear me, making my work amiss. I, who procure them pleasures, counting not years or cost, Taste not myself the treasures always for me but lost. Worship to Him goes daily up from priest-ridden earth, And though His servants gaily tax me they give but dearth. Men for Him raise the column as to its native sky, While I remain a solemn fate and necessity. Ever the purblind peoples groping in shade and shame, Toying with towers and steeples, tremble to hear my name; Foist upon me afflictions wrought by their own weak hands, Heaping me maledictions through the self-tortured lands; Paint me in colours growing deeper and darker yet, When from their wicked sowing they at the reaping fret. Thoughts of their private plotting only on me they lay, While they are rank and rotting just with their own decay. All that I do they garble, turned to offence and vice, Paying to God the marble court and the sacrifice; Reckoning mine their fancies tainted by mire and mould, Dross and the morbid dances—meting to Him the gold. I am not the Creator, framing their course and creed; I am no Legislator, shaping that bruised reed. But the whole imperfection, breaches of slighted law, Blemish and predilection still for the fatal flaw; Follies of their devising, blots and their native lust, Scorn for a re-arising out of congenial dust; These with their stains and errors, steps that delight to be Straying and stupid terrors, lightly are thrown on me. I did not form them dimly, blent of the common clay, Passion and powers that grimly sap them and eat away; I did not mix their feelings fast with unmating fire, Wedding to earthly reelings pulses of pure desire. Did I unmake and mar them, fresh from the Almighty hand; And with my cunning bar them, when they would upright stand? Yet in their brighest jewel, volition fair and free, Lay hid the faint and cruel germ of a fall to be. I did but helpless follow the road marked out as mine, And in the darkness hollow a prison with God's line. How could I baulk my being and cheat the iron law, Which deals me night for seeing and shuts me out in awe? I just obeyed the nature, which in me sternly drew Others, and to this stature by certain stages grew. I do not loathe the beauty, I never hated right, But must fulfil my duty and turn my face from Light. Ah, who shall tell the sadness which sears my destined bound, And with the mirth of madness girds all my service round? For when I break a nation or some poor fragile heart, It is the obligation of my lone, awful part. I have no choice, no action can be except for ill, Ground to its smallest fraction within the fated mill. And though I curse the sentence I love it because mine, Nor would I give repentance to earn the Peace Divine. I know when sin is greatest in evil deed or thought, While grief is green and latest, I do but what I ought. No way is open other than that which God will go, I work and am His brother—I tempt and am His foe. I in my circuits slowly am labouring for the end, A climax grand and holy to which creations tend; That yet may never finish the upward-climbing task, Nor may I once diminish my own, nor would I ask. And if I gain for mortals, by trying or by test, Escape through golden portals, I may not therefore rest. The joy they reach by anguish o'er which they mount and shine, Though for their hour they languish—it cannot still be mine. The sweetness in the profit by conquests won from me, If worlds get pleasure off it, I may not likewise see. For everyone a haven comes to each tossing tide, Or path with sorrow paven—I only stand outside. But on I go by acrid dull streams, with penal rods; My work is truly sacred, the complement of God's. His enemy, the spoiler of His best deeds and man's, I am a fellow-toiler and share His broadest plans. His tool, His jailer, keeping the rebels He would bind, I hold a watch unsleeping and purge His dust behind. Were I at last to perish, expunged from earth and sky, How could the Maker cherish or lift mortality? The universal struggle, that hammers out His claim, By force and fraud that juggle with men, would miss its aim. And thus I search new nations, within my furnace fused, By fire of fierce temptations—I cursing, curst, and used. THE RED ROSE AND BLUE. It was whiter than snow When the Master went by— Who would walk in His garden, and watched it below With a loving and Fatherly eye; And He fondled a Lily, or played with the bell Of a Hyacinth bowing in grace, While His footstep was life to the buds as it fell And they gathered fresh light from His Face; Ah, the Crocus looked up With its yellowing cup, And the Pansy bent timidly down— For His wonderful thought filled its bosom with God As beside it in rapture He tenderly trod, And the Violet drew in its gown. It was whiter than snow, And yet pride entered in At the joy of its gifts and the maidenly glow, With a feeling that darkened like sin; And it said to itself, “I am fairer than He With a purity sweeter than morn, For the White Rose is brightest of all that I see And it has not one petulant thorn.” But the Blue Roses wept, As caressing He stept By their borders, in reverent fears; While they mused on the blessings no creature would crave, Which He poured in the beauties He lavishly gave, And they watered His path with their tears. It was whiter than snow— But the Master at last, As He left His dear garden in fragrance to blow, Just a look of reproach on it cast; And there rushed through its veins a great passion of shame At the wrong to His graciousness done, And came blossoming forth in a glory of flame With the thorns and the shadow at one. So the White Rose turned Red, And hung lowly its head When again the good Father went by; But He took the Blue Roses away in His love To the carpet that covers the Eden above, And He planted them out in the sky. THE PHANTOM CROSS. For years I bare the burden of a cross, With toiling footsteps up a barren hill, Unto a dim and distant gate of glory Framed in a heaven of clouds, and only seen At sunrise by the watcher dutiful Who wakes the morning with the breath of prayer. And there was none to help me. Patiently I climbed those steps of stone, till each a palace Of praise became, as I poured out my heart In sacrifice of ceaseless thanksgiving, For the great blessing of unanswered hopes And saving sorrow by the ministries Of calculated suffering, and the crown With thorns that blossomed while they pierced my brow And burst in fragrance flooding all the ways With sweetness like a song. I saw the crimson Dear petals falling round in drops of blood. Nor did I murmur at the bitter road, The jagged cragged turns of gaunt surprise That fronted me and frowned at every pause, And reached forth rocky arms to thrust me down Deep and yet deeper in unplumbed abysses And hungered for me, body and soul. I went Still steadfast on, and still the burden grew More heavy and more hateful and it seemed In that dread passion of intolerableness A vital portion with my very flesh And bone and tissue consubstantiate, No alien bondage but myself sin-rotted And dead. But now my consecrated will Arose in arms and with its larger choice Upheld me, as I stooped exceedingly Beneath the inward load, and felt my limbs Relax a faithless moment in the pains Insufferable and their dark secret strife, And lifted me as though on wings above The passing weakness which had made me water; Till in the glow and flow of strength renewed And added powers, I trod temptation down Below my feet, and mounted higher yet Upon its dust that fashioned for my feet Foundations firm and new defensiveness. And when at last hardly I reached the summit, The cross I carried was no cross at all But the mere empty shadow of a fate That was not mine, the phantom of a woe, Imagination's trick—no more, no less— Which aped the ripeness of reality. My pangs, and the bleak road unbeautiful, The dreary drudging to the castled top Consummate in its height, the rough hewn steps, The iron great hands of winds that by the throat Clutched me o'erwearied and contestingly Strove with me to the death, the dizzy ledge, The sudden chasms and corners, and the grim Magnificence of sheer sharp headlong falls Down into empty space and nothingness, The discipline, the yoke, the angry edges That cut like cruel swords, the beetling points Of bayonetted bounds that shut me in, And the lone horror of the haunted peak; All these were rooted in rich outwardness, But not the burden of the blessèd cross Which while I bare I bare not verily Save in belief, though its pure virtue ran Right through my inmost being and was mingled With every act and thought, and shaped my path Unto the pattern of its archetype. And thus I found, who passed the golden gate, The seeming and the substance were both one, And truth was beauty but the vision more. THE BOOKS OF ETERNITY. The Books were carried To the Judge, who sat High on the throne of thought, and worlds thereat In silent session tarried; I in fear Stood far apart and to the extreme edge Clung, while an unshed tear A moment blotted out the awful sight Of nations quivering like the breeze-blown sedge In arrows of intolerable Light. Unsaid confession Trembled on the lips of all, Who owned transgression And bowed beneath the shadow of the fall. Not one Dared to uplift the burden of a plea, But with the murmur of a troubled sea The peoples knew the fate foredone. The Book of Life was opened, and I saw The law Written therein with fire and burning truth And love's eternal youth, While in the solemn thunder Of each line I felt the beating of the Heart Divine, Which all its blessed mist would burst asunder. Then the Book of Remembrance was unsealed, And I A little yet more nigh Drew, for the doom to be revealed. The hush fell calm and cruel On my mind, Strained unto hope and yet resign'd To utmost wrath. Was I a jewel Recorded there, if but a casual blot, Or not? And then another tear Clouded my eyes, And in the dimness I stept still more near The white seat of all the eternities, Uuder the blinding curtain Of my grief, Which with a foot uncertain Sought relief. Lo, as in ages, One by one the pages Were turned, in that great dreadful judgment shine; I read the names of friends and brothers And of others, But amid the thousands where was mine? O some were sadly blurred, and some were stains, And all had blighted been with sin, While many struggled forth by bitter pains, But yet they were within. I looked and trembled, And a hunted cry Of stricken woe and supreme agony Brake from my tossing bosom undissembled; And then a tortured tear, Right from my very heart, Rushed to the eyes of darkness and despair Which scarce Omnipotence could now repair; I took another step more bold, more near, No longer self-exiled and all apart. And there I read As risen from out the dead, In small and feeble letters but of flame, Like that which glows in sacred shrines, On the last page, between the closing lines, My name. A THEOPHANY. O, it may be in the morning, and it may be in the eve— He will surely on me rise Like the sun, but in adorning which will set not or deceive, With a glad and soft surprise; And the passing of His feet will be beautiful and sweet, When it strikes my waiting heart In its watching drawn apart From the turmoil of the traffic and the murmur of the mart. In the stable not of fable I shall find Him with His beasts Where He spreads their humble feasts, And the reckless one and stranger to His love shall see at last The bright shadow in the manger by His blessed glory cast, In His thought for even cattle which about his business go When the shafts of winter rattle on the shield of frozen snow; And the path for years so prayerless in its pride and cold and careless, Shall beneath His presence glow. He is coming, for I hear Him Through the clangour and the dust Of the world so very near Him— And yet exiled by distrust; But from faith that is adoring He will never be concealed, Though their darkness dazzle some, And to words of true imploring He delights to be revealed— He is coming, He will come. Lo, the linnet from the moorland chirrupt, “Here's a little Christ, And I simply ask a crumb.” While the pauper in his poorland said, “I cannot be sufficed, And these hands are Christ's and numb.” O the enemy whose hate is my early grief and late, Muttered low beneath His breath; “Though I have desired thy death, Yet I feel the Christ within me, and He stands outside thy gate.” Then my broken bread, in token of His love I scattered free To His birds a willing fee, And up leapt their tiny voices in one carol calm and gay Like a fountain which rejoices in the kisses of the day. And the beggar at my giving thawed with gratitude, and took Heart of grace in grander living and a conqueror's proud look; And the foe, whom in my blindness I had scouted with unkindness, Chose the friend he long forsook. He is coming on the river, He is coming to the shore In His goodness to deliver Men who make their bondage more; In the faintest, feeblest turning as of tendrils to the morn, He is calling—He is come; And of every better yearning He in purity is born, Who's all Blessing and our Home. THE DEAD GOD. Rose a weeping and a wailing for the altars unavailing And the temple fires grown dim, From the high angelic hosts and the Seraphs at their posts And the sworded Cherubim. Though the worshippers were legion and they flocked from every region And they builded fair the shrine, Not with walls the pious raise by their lives of prayer and praise And the humble heart divine; But with gold and gems and painting and the sculpture with the tainting Of unrighteousness that wrought, Or the offerings of vice and the souls that had their price And in hourly sale were bought. For the faith was empty-hearted and the light had long departed From the cloister and its lamp, And the perjured breasts were cold and misgivings like the mould Upon all had set a stamp; And amid the pleasant places shone but harlot gauds and graces Or lay silence of the tomb, While the love that leapt in flame to the Presence and the Name Died as fruit within the womb. Then with wailing and a weeping for religion dumb and sleeping And the glory faded thence, Ring a solemn awful sound to the earth's remotest bound,— “O arise, let us go hence.” With a weeping and a wailing as if earth itself were failing Under some tremendous throe, And the pillars of the land could no longer now withstand Weight of unimagined woe; Passed a glamour from the column and the sanctuary solemn Where the nations blindly knelt, In the tutelary awe which was luminous with law And by ghostly comfort felt; While the peoples in the motion of their impotent devotion Knew that something great had set, And the words they mumbled still were but curses and an ill Though they bowed and babbled yet. For the Providences reigning from the falsehood and the feigning With a mighty murmur fled, And a horror grim and stark in the silence and the dark Dropt where music had been shed; While from fanes' august recesses went the Ever-lastingnesses That alone could give man breath, And on priests and splendid frauds and the chanted lies and lauds Fell a shadow more than death. With a wailing and a weeping of the Powers that had the keeping Of the altars which smoked on, Knelled a lost and lonely cry from the temples to the sky,— “O away, let us be gone.” With a weeping and a wailing from the porch and gilded railing Of the holy fabrics doomed, Went the Presence that had been a Magnificence unseen While the flower of worship bloomed. Though they lifted high the ladder and the steps were sins and sadder Than the way to heaven should be, And were washed within the flood of the blesséd martyrs' blood, Who had suffered to be free. Ah, it found the earth was frozen by the empty creeds that cozen With their superstitions fond, As it passed into the air from the ruin past repair Like the breaking of a bond. There were idols framed of letters and a clanking of the fetters Which had eaten into lives, And the votaries were fools of their pious toys and tools Or the sacrificial knives. For the gods were naught and nameless and a multitude and shameless, And the mystery had flown, While their victims bent to chance and a crowned ignorance And the Truth remained unknown. With a wailing and a weeping went the hosts angelic sweeping Through a world without a heart, And a voice of sorrow brake from the stillness as it spake, “O arise, let us depart!” With a weeping and a wailing in a cloud of glory sailing Went the Spirit who was God, And the ardent Seraphim and the sworded Cherubim, Into spaces yet untrod. There was many a rolling planet bright as when the Word began it But polluted by one fall, And despite the gracious glow deep a rottenness below Rested terrible on all. Blight had seized the worship hollow and the Nemesis to follow Was a canker in the deed, And no fruits of goodly faith but its dazzling idle wraith Burst in sunshine from the seed. Pomp of service joined with glitter of proud sacraments, but bitter Was the reaping at the last, For on every soul a cloud hung as heavy as a shroud And the course was overcast. While the pageants and the flocking to confession were a mocking Or a masquerade of life, And the verities were hid and beneath a coffin lid By the selfish paltry strife. With a wailing and a weeping at the icy darkness creeping Through creation to its Head, Pealed a voice upon the air of an infinite despair,— “Without honour I am dead.” THE POTTER AND THE CLAY. O Heavenly Potter, Unto Thee I come, But not with empty murmurs as do some Because the furnace has been heated hotter, And at the cruel pains The flesh complains. Not so do I address Thee, but I bless Thee For all the suffering to which man is kin And each dark sorrow of the day and morrow, For every ache which heart hath known Except for that which is my own— The sin. I am Thy vessel If no chosen one, For mighty actions to be dared and done, And in my bosom human passions wrestle As ever must in all— Even blessed Paul. And thus I sorely need Thee and would heed Thee Amid this babblement of strife and wrong, What e'er the vial dashed on me by trial, To keep me up should tempting shake My boldest purpose, and to make Me strong. Thou art the Potter, And I feel Thy hand Rests on me though I be unmeet to stand, And holds me upright when my footsteps totter; For I am only clay, And often stray. But then I want the folding and the moulding, About my mortal weakness which is much; And there, from fretting and my dull forgetting, Falls like a beam of solemn light In joy of mercy and its might Thy touch. I am a brittle And a worthless cup, For all I bring I grudge to offer up And at the best my utmost is but little; The services are mean, My lips unclean; The hand that decks the altar still may palter With things of evil and my breast is stone; And if unwilling yet I seek fulfilling Of many a sordid lie and lust, Which would pollute with shame and dust Thy throne. Thou art the Potter, And I come to Thee For that sweet cleansing which can make me free, And curb the will which is a rebel plotter Against Thy holy law And loving awe. O I do crave Thy kindness on this blindness To pour the sunshine of perpetual day, And with more favour to enrich the savour Of sacrifices vile and slow Without Thy blessing, and to show The way. I am an idle And unfaithful tool, Yet plunge me in the furnace of Thy school And pierce me with the cross which is Thy bridle; I need the fiercest flame, To know Thy name. And if Thou choosest take me all and break me, If I may be in heart renewed and shine: I would be shivered through to be delivered From bondage foul, and scourged and scarred To be at length (however marred) But Thine. THE PRESENCE. When the Presence draweth nearer, Which is God, And the voice upon me clearer (While I dumbly darkly plod) Comes, as o'er a thirsty shore— Growing desolate and drearer With the rod Of affliction's maledictions— Fall at last, in mercy cast Slaking clod and barren sod, Warm sweet billows finding pillows And the rest of sorrow's breast; Though I feel the fatal twining Of a horror without ray Round me as I faintly stand Feeling for the expected day, Death is but the veilèd shining Or the shadow of His hand. And I pray, At the clouding of the way, Lest I stumble on or stray In the desert of the land; “Keep me, guide me, hold me, hide me, In the hollow of Thy hand.” RETROSPECT. In the dim shadows of the dying year I stand apart in awful loneliness, And read the solemn picture of the past Unrolled before me like an open book, Ere it is sealed and laid upon the shelf Of faded hopes and pious memories And pretty thoughts and fruitless resolutions. I see it now with vain regrets and fears, Too late for medicining of other means; The thing accomplished that I did not will, Which came against my better judgment mocked And marred and unconsenting to the last— Yet came; the wiser thing by me intended, As some stretched bow without the arrow's point, A shy and shadowy outline unfulfilled And blurred but still most beautiful of all, With sudden sunrise lights and flames of flowers And promise brighter than the morn. I mark Myself, a blotted shape, blear-eyed and lame, Misformed and with dark devious footsteps, blind, Stumbling and groping painfully along A way, no way in mist impenetrable, And beating the thick air with idle hands Chained; and a different form of grace appears Beside the other and its counterpart, Like and unlike my own, divinely human, Serene and in a solitude of joy Ineffable, which walks the earth a king Over itself and all, crowned and complete In unapproachableness of clear life— A radiant thing, an immortality. This is the angel in me, the sweet God That dwells in every man a dream incarnate, Magnificence of possibility, And would arise and from its envelope Of flesh and blood shine out and scatter beams And blessings round in excellent fair deeds. My archetype! I see it manifold And mystical with inward gifts and graces, That should be mine and would engarment me For ever in the purest panoplies Of innocence with armèd knowledge one; Did I but bow the stubborn head and stoop To that dear yoke of utter gentleness, The service free, which giving all yet garners Both worlds of beauty with itself in God. CREDO QUIA IMPOSSIBILE. I do believe that in me something dwells Akin to all and the eternal fact, Bodied in words or grand incarnate act Which down the ages rings cathedral bells; And I am closer Heaven than earth, and more The spirit of me is than painted flesh Though cunningly with white and blue-veined mesh Made sweet and good and pleasant to adore; And through me thrill the symphonies of Space To find a chord or two of answering grace, And here and there a note of rich regretfulness For other times and chimes in larger lands When love responded to the Master's hands; And I may mount to that far great forgetfulness Which brings us nearest God, and makes the man The likest Him and the consummate plan. I cannot think, I would not, if it might Be possible, this person is but clay Compounded of the dust and low and slight, Which takes the impress of each passing day, Because it must from bondage unto ill, And dares not upright stand and say “I will;” Half educated brute, and half a toy Or mere machine which darkly beats and babbles And in the scorèd sand a moment scrabbles Its epitaph, and dies without a joy. For into me the currents flow, that leap From under the pure feet of Him who shakes The granite mountains to a shapeless heap, And with the mighty moulding thought remakes The suns and systems all; and from me breathes Some fragrance of His own Diviner dresses, That seamless robe of awful righteousnesses, Wherein He walks and wherein He enwreathes The tinest atom of the world; I feel My heart doth echo back His tune, Amid the uproar of the clanging steel, And holds within it bright perpetual June Rose-sweet and warm and with His air delicious, Though round me moves and mows the clamorous throng In seeming triumph of most deadly wrong— Yet is this well, and sorrow most propitious. I may not tell you why I claim the credo Dearer than life and love, for words were weak To syllable the truth if they did speak; And who could tell his secret so? Could Guido Give you the hidden mystery that throbs And palpitates in glowing forms, and art Which is himself and all his very heart? The letter kills, the bald expression robs The glamour of its honey, dew and bloom; And as you seize the soul of things it perishes Within your grasp and victory is doom, And dust abides which some museum cherishes. I cannot reason out this living faith, Which burns in me and lifts me high to summits And down the deep abysses beyond plummets, Untrodden by the foot of man and known To nothing mortal and yet most my own; No phantasy or trick, no idle wraith Upconjured by a vain imagining, Or fraud. It mingles with the waft of heather On tumbled hills, and low soft murmuring Of many bees in spaces of blue weather; I hear it in the purling of shy brooks, The voice of children and the chant of birds And laughing breezes in sequestered nooks; It canopies my head like heaven, it girds My loins with giant youth and bids me run Rejoicing to the gateways of the sun. I cannot get away from this, it follows My flying steps from marble messages Of fossil forms to lonely silences, Where whispers Nature in the hush of hollows Serener things to gentle minds; it falls, My shadow, on the rim of storied chalices Whence drank red lips of maidens fair and ripe Long long ago, and on the broken walls Of citadels where Time has carved its malices; In quarried stone and mercy's healing stripe It hath a portion and it leaves a trace, And babies' dimples are its dwelling place. Impossible it is, and therefore yet In moonrise and the mist where suns have set And left a golden gospel and the streak Of glancing dawn which comes and yet comes not And dallies with its opening door, I mark Dim prophecies of that which doth not wreak Its will entire in outwardness of lot Material, but still touches all the dark With dashes somewhere of its own divinity, And is the soul of each young life's virginity. But I am one with this, what'er it be, Though in the brunt of brutal might and cunning That send our blood and tears in rivers running, Through every time and place, and in the breath Of pleasure grimly pulse; this makes me free, King of myself and the wide world and fate, And bids me enter calm and crowned the gate Predestined of the tomb, and builds of death A stepping stone to grander heights. I hear The murmur of this old and gracious verity, In hope that singeth and sublimer fear That reads earth's riddle though with pale temerity; And in the grinding of the wheels that turn For ever round and round, and carry men And universal Nature forth and far With their tremendous beats, and champ and churn Our cosmic stuff to living soul or star, To portals of some new supremer ken. I cannot write you out a clear particular Dry thesis framed by logic of my creed, In loops and links of formulæ vermicular; For with myself still doth it always grow, And puts fresh petals out for every need Of daily use; but in the night I know; And if false rays should dazzle and deceive Or nothing seem at last quite sure and noscible, Yet in mid darkness shall I most believe Because I am and Truth is so impossible. THE MIDGE AND ITS MAKER. I. The Midge. Thou Being, whom I cannot know, But dimly guess from far In storied rock and star, And feel in trumpet winds that blow Or waters as they laugh and flow, And witness what they are. I am Thy creature, great God, still And every feature shows Thy will; But wherefore am I made so weak And didst Thou masterfully wreak Thy power in me, who scarce can speak And tremble at each ill? While Thou dost sit above this babble So very grand and strong, Untouched by any wrack and wrong Wherein our wretched hour we dabble. There seems no justice in the plan, Which fashioned me so small; I hardly live at all, In this poor petty fleeting span; And there the mountain and the man, Rejoice and on Thee call! And yet Thy moulding hand has wrought Me, and is holding up in thought; Though slender be my lot and slight It would work out its reason right, And shares in the same common Light Which comes to us unsought. And none is formed of diverse matter, We issue from one Fount Whate'er the last account— If rays of dawn or death we scatter. Why is existence cut so short For butterfly and bee, That share alike in Thee Though in Thy outside temple court; When each is striving for the Port, Where only are we free? Why is the allotted time so mean, With frailty spotted and unclean? It could have spread for ages on And with its splendour proudly shone Or been a tower for kingdoms gone, Whereon a world might lean; But now in every breeze I flutter And find the coming doom Even in the morning's bloom, And feel a woe I may not utter. II. The Maker. O murmur not thy life is brief, And others are so long; The Maker does no wrong, Who measures gladness out and grief Which is its own divine relief And wings thy hour with song. For time no treasure is, and might Withdraws its pleasures in the night; And the amœba, which will lie In mud and misery and vie In age with me, can never die— But lacks thy being bright; I know not what ye call duration, But mark the victory won And duty hard yet done— I work, within, the sole salvation. Nor pass thy office careless by, Because it bulks not large; Thou seeëst not the marge Which broader is than earth and sky And runs out to Infinity With universes' charge; The frame that reaches not a span To eyes, yet preaches truth—as man; The envelope is not the thing, And life doth boast a deeper spring Than vulgar size or width of wing— It bears all angels can; And if the shell be low, yet under Its shadow in each part, Beats My pervading Heart, For kindred hope—as in the thunder. Ah, nothing common is or poor Or toils at useless task, Which does whate'er I ask; Behind the beast and in the boor Or tiniest insect of the moor, Eternal forces mask. And times and spaces unto Me, Write no more traces than on sea; They are but modes, whereby the clod And every breathing root and rod At last discover they are God, And labour to be free. Yes, thou, if summer mite or vernal And but a dying midge, Art too my very bridge From earth to Heaven and the Eternal. THE CRY OF THE WORM. “Here lies poor old John Hildebrod; Have mercy on his soul, Lord God, As he would do were he Lord God, And Thou but poor John Hildebrod.” Epitaph. Be merciful to me, Lord God, as I would pity Thee, Wert Thou as I a crumbling clod with scarce a fancy free; Made only, it is writ, of dust which dances at Thy breath, By sin corroded as by rust, with native seeds of death; A groping creature, deaf and blind and vainly learning still, While tost about by every wind of passion or of ill! Whatever be Thy tune, O Lord, I cannot choose but tread The destined measure, if the sword is hanging o'er my head; And sick or sorry I must keep in time with every tone, I step it through my haunted sleep, unwilling and alone. Within this gaunt and ghastly bound of rank and rotting flesh, I go the same dull dreary round and evermore afresh. Be merciful to me, Lord God, as I would pity Thee, Wert thou as helpless as the sod or fading as the tree! Up in that wondrous house of blue where suns in glory shine, While nought but darkness is my due, dost Thou consider mine? This is not builded on the rock, my walls are very weak And tremble at the shade of shock—they totter as I speak; To any peril that may chance I do but hopeless bend, The sport of spiteful circumstance I dumbly wait the end. To Thee is man a tiny mote a minute in the ray, A sand-mark idle fingers wrote ere it was washed away? For be one cottager or Guelf, he is in frailty grown; I dare not say I am myself, and nothing is my own. Be simply just to me, Lord God, as I would unto Thee, Wert Thou beneath the iron rod which crushes all I see! I am but fashioned out of clay, a vessel of no worth, To live and struggle my dim day and be resolved to earth. O treat me not as precious gold which hottest flames may try, I carry on my face the mould of this mortality, And, in each trifling word and deed, there is the fateful ring Of dissolution and a need which ever to me cling. Deal not with me as chalices which are of grander kin, I show mere evil images and centuries of sin. At birth I found a hideous taint which errors more enhance, Whereunder I do flinch and faint, a grim inheritance. Be simply just to me, Lord God, as I would unto Thee! Wert Thou as lightly at the nod of woes we cannot flee, Foredoomed to failure do I come into this care and wrong, With many mingled aims, though some are beautiful and strong; I am not master of my powers or even a single nerve, And naked still I hold my dowers for others whom I serve; Each moment I new sadness prove chained in this prison frame, Beyond which I can nowise move who play a desperate game; Around me hostile forces fret, with which a traitorous camp Inside is leagued against me yet—I only bear their stamp. This is a stage of lasting strife with threads of crimson crost, A living death, a dying life, and from the outset lost. MAN THE MAKER. Dear God, Thy cheeks are very thin, And feebly dost Thou go Through the creations out and in, Because my prayers are slow; And none but such as these disperse The darkness of the universe, Through which we dimly know. My praises oft, which built Thee fat And full with leaping life, By doubts that on me sorely sat, When I would fondly aim thereat Were quenched by evil strife. O, it is true Thy mercy made My poverty, and wrought Its grandeur on a thing of shade By every passion bought; But still the tiniest wavelet, pent Within its mother continent, Imprints its little thought. But Thou art moulded by my hand And with my worship shaped, As winds and waters form the land Which, though they never may command, By them is carved and draped. Thou feedest on my faith and love While famine comes from fears, And all Thy gardens up above Are watered by my tears; If I forget Thee, Thou dost pine Out of the majesty Divine, And tremble at the years. Devotion is the life that thrills The Glory that Thou art, And like a thousand thousand rills With more than bliss and beauty fills The heaven of Thy great Heart. And so I nourish Thee at morn With prayers as precious sops, And pledge to Thee in sadness born My troth in tender drops; At noontide and at eve I raise My services of solemn praise, A fount that never stops. And in the night I often turn My waking hopes to Thee, With wingéd thoughts that speed and spurn The lower air and words that burn, That Thou may'st warmer be. I clothe Thee richly with the dress Of reverent awe and care, And in that robe of righteousness I have a humble share; For it is woven of my true Confessions as with threads of blue, And creeds that greatly dare. My witness is Thy sure defence Which bids Thee grander grow, Thy shoes are of my confidence, My martyrdoms and penitence Red in Thy halo glow. Thus, though I am but common clay And mingled with the dust, My fingers on Thee have their way To model with their trust; And my creation Thou art much Responding to each tone and touch, As unto Thee I must. Thou waxest with my worship strong And in this frailty small, My zeal doth make Thy bosom song And lighten duties that were long— I fashion Thee in all. HOME SICKNESS. I often have a sense of other lands, A glow, a glimmer Of unremembered unforgotten times, When earth grows dimmer; Which moves me like the touch of loving hands, Mixed with the music as of distant chimes. A thing familiar And yet so alien, most remote and near; A sweet auxiliar Beyond all language beautiful and dear, While past the unmeasured bounds and awful rounds Of unpathed planets, through their purple dome For ever swinging and for ever singing; A strange dim dwelling far, and still a Home. Betwixt the sorrow and the parent sin It draweth nigher From an inviting and forbidden shore, With message higher; It seems unknown, and is in all akin, And brings me earnest of no foreign lore. Betwixt the falling Of shadows tempting me to shame and wrong, And the calm calling Of holy bells that chant the evensong; It cometh to me then with larger ken, Like the unsealing of a sacred tome. I feel a drawing and an overawing Of something great, which is and is not Home. And in the bosom of warm love and light, When pulses quicken With rest and rapture, for another hope I dumbly sicken; For solace more than meets the ear and sight, The vision of a vaster horoscope. My soul seems banished From grander courts that rouse my fear and faith, A kingdom vanished But veiled not quite by earth's refulgent wraith; And from the tenderest ties of lower skies Bright with the grace of Hellas and of Rome, I turn unsated like a life unmated, And stretch dark hands to a conjectured home. I know by these blind stirrings in my heart Which beats in prison, I yet have might though fettered that would mount To suns unrisen, Wherein I have a birthright and a part, And drink the fulness of its native fount. The sense of sadness Which never leaves me in my work or play, Proclaims the gladness Elsewhere of the old lost unsetting day. I find the closest bond has links beyond, And mirth the mocking of an evil gnome, While in my weeping and the haunted sleeping I feel the fretful wings that crave their home. BLIND HANDS. Dear God, in darkness I uplift to Thee Dim eyes that cannot see Amid the horrors of this stony starkness, Blind hands in bondage that would fain be free To work their little lot—and yet may not. What can I offer Thee who grantest all that fills my coffer, My slender purse, And every winning save my own sad sinning, Which ends a season for a new beginning With its curse? Thou art the Maker And the Poet too, Not I who vainly woo Thy sea of Light which whelms me like a breaker And does the task which I would feebly do, Or washes from my toil the earthly soil. Alas, my guesses Fall but weakly, and Thy wisdom blesses Whate'er is right And honest aiming, if with error's maiming; For how can I, a shadow, plead a claiming Out of night? My work is nothing And my beauty Thine, When Thou dost greatly shine Upon me, and art thus my strength and clothing; The good that I have wrought is but Divine, The stains that still must be, belong to me. The faith for living, Is not even mine but Thy free giving; And cometh love, The bread of staying in the strife and playing Without which every breath of man were slaying, From above. I am no Poem, Father, at my best, In borrowed glory drest, But just a line or two of Thy grand Proem To something higher and not now exprest; I hear its tune afar, and often mar. And each creation Of my heart is all Thine inspiration, Though poorly drawn; And every gleaming jewel on the seaming Of my spoiled garment, is Thy splendour beaming To the dawn. MAN IS WHAT WOMAN MAKES HIM. Man is what woman makes him, And so I say, God bless her; A hero, if to her white breast she takes him When downward passions pull, And moulds him beautiful— Her bulwark and assessor; But if she fools and then at last forsakes him, A low and lost transgressor. But when her fingers play upon his heart As though it were her lute strings, No longer mild and mute strings, He leaps to glory and the goodlier part. Man is what woman makes him, And so I say, God bless her; A noble worker, if she wins and wakes him, And watches through the night With him to morning light— A stout and staunch confessor; But if with false or trifling arts she breaks him, No mate or wrong's redresser, But when she breathes her love into his life And bathes him in her beauty, He thrills to each high duty And comes as conqueror out of every strife. Man is what woman makes him, And so I say, God bless her; A true yoke-fellow, if she tends and takes him With each imperfect plan, A frail and fallen man, In suffering her assessor; But if she asks completeness and forsakes him, He must be more transgressor. For he is only human at the best, And she may urge him forward, As waves together shoreward Beat on, and but in dying gain their rest. Man is what woman makes him, And so I say, God bless her; A helper in the struggle, if she wakes him From drowsy poppied sloth, To keep the eternal troth With Christ as his Confessor. But if she slumbers, or with slighting breaks him, No aid or ill's redresser. For her pure softness is a heaven-sent stayer Yet stronger far than iron, And her weak arms environ His force like blessings of perpetual prayer. “WILT THOU HAVE THIS WOMAN?” Brother, wilt thou have this woman? She is frail, though very fair With the glory on her hair, And the red rose laughing on her lips; She is tender, she is human, And doth know of evil and eclipse. Wilt thou reverence her weakness, As thou would'st the blessed Christ Left in lonely awful meekness At the world's one bitter tryst? Then thou may'st, but trembling, O man, Take as trust Divine this woman. Brother, wilt thou have this woman? She is shy as evening shade, Excellently meant and made And compounded of all soft and sweet; But most brittle and most human, Nor least lovely in her straying feet. Wilt thou choose this one to cherish In such imperfection shod, Who without thy care must perish Though the masterpiece of God? Then thou may'st devoutly, O man, Take from Him this sacred woman. Brother, wilt thou have this woman? She has thoughts beyond thy dreams Marvellous as moonlit streams, And a faithfulness to thee not known; But she is unarmed and human, An eternal child, with ways her own. Wilt thou keep and comfort duly Her in high or low estate, And uphold in honour truly One so dear and delicate? Then thou mayst, but humbly, O man, Take and wear this jewel—woman. Brother, wilt thou have this woman? She is wonderful and slight, Though a mystery of might, Stronger than the death that is to be; But all exquisitely human With devotion deeper than the sea. Wilt thou love this priceless treasure (As a soul elect to save, Not a toy to break at pleasure), And her only to the grave? Then thou may'st, rejoicing, O man, Take thy guardian angel, woman. CRUCIFIED AFRESH. I had a vision of a Tree, Which men had grimly planted, A thing that breathed and panted And dolorous and dread to see; It spread abroad two mighty arms, As under black and bitter charms Accursed and enchanted. But all the heaven above was dark, Earth trembled and stood still, The whole creation's populations Were dumb, and dimly seemed to hark The Maker's awful will. And on the Tree a Sacred Form Hung in exceeding sadness, Yet conquered by the gladness That shook him like a summer storm; Innumerable fiends and foes Heaped on Him shameful words and woes, In murder and in madness. With savage scorn each cruel thrust Of crimson nails and spears, Was through his riven bosom driven; But could not slay His solemn trust, Which triumphed over fears. But in a moment then I saw The multitudes departed, Which had in hate upstarted, And I alone was left in awe. For, ah, those hostile hands were mine Which stabbed the Blessed One Divine, So dear and broken-hearted. My sins had daily pierced Him sore, And were a scourging rod; Though that red-fruited tree was rooted With burdens I had made the more, Within the heart of God. For every time I chose to stray And fell or freely stumbled, With pride still never humbled, The suffering on His shoulder lay; And His the anguish and the loss, When resolutions turned to dross Or faiths beneath me crumbled. And if I yielded to the flesh For which He greatly died, Those wounds with weeping from their sleeping Burst open all and bled afresh, And He was crucified. MY DIVINE FATHER. Being beyond all names, blessed, benign, Throned above frosts and flames looming malign; Health of us, Heart of us, living only by greatness of giving; Fount of the universe breath, Passion and joy, treasure or toy, By a perpetual death! Riding on thunder, tracing in straws— Stars cleft asunder, goodness and laws; Ever expressing mercy and might, Ever caressing worlds with fresh light. Many the honours fair carried by fire and air, Unto Thy shrine; Yet would I trembling rather Worship Thee but as Father, Dearest and mine, Dreadful, Divine. Worlds are Thy garments worn thus for an age, Ere with new vesture morn brings a new stage. Mystical, terrible, flowing on through a measureless growing Forth from original Night, Into broad runs, systems and suns, Scattering orbs in Thy flight. Kindness and terror guard Thee and guide Safe from all error, far above pride. Judgment and pity compass Thee round, Leaving the city holier ground, Making the country sweet just with Thy passing feet, Until they shine. Yet do I boldly gather Out of all titles, Father, Richest of Thine, Gentle, Divine. CHRIST AND THE MURDERER. Dear sinner, that poor red right hand which struck the fatal blow, Was lifted against My command and Me it first laid low. Betwixt thee and thy dreadful aim, because I loved thee best And had the one eternal claim, I threw My bleeding Breast. The knife beat back My mighty Love, wherein Thou hadst no part Less than all wealth of Heaven above, and pierced this broken Heart. Thy hatred vented most on Me its bitterness and wrath, And flouted Mercy that set free as air the upward path. I felt the fatal wound, that deep of guilty murder drank, Opening the silent lands of sleep, and with thy victim sank. The horror lay not upon him alone, which to Me cried; I knew its presence cold and dim, and also truly died. No homicidal thought could fail to stab, no stubborn pride; Each angry feeling was a nail, which tore My tender side. And every pulse of passion, made of wedded mocks and scorns, Wove for My Head in awful shade another crown of thorns. The cutting words were as the spear which racked My human Flesh, And wrung from it the crimson tear and crucified afresh. The very looks so base and black were harder than the rod, They rained as tempest on My back and scourged the helpless God. The strokes, the insults and the ire heaped on that slaughtered frame, Yet kindled Me a burning fire of solitude and shame. For I shall suffer in the law which justly takes thy breath, And hang with thee and grimly draw new terrors out of death. GOD OUR HOME. It is not any mortal space nor tenderest human tie, Wherein I have a resting place and infant-wise may lie; Each earthy bond it's far beyond, and dearest when I die. O softer than the sweetest, most blessed and the meetest Of every link whereby we drink at fountains the completest! The mother and her babe must part, although her breast be heaven, And likest to God's own great Heart and with His holy leaven; The bride in her pure bridal raiment must give at once the dreadful payment With her young virgin charms, If death should come and be the claimant, And leave her bridegroom's arms. But kingdoms to their doom shall tumble, and pass a shadow Rome; Yea, heaven and earth in ashes crumble, and never touch my Home. It is above the changeful sod nor mingled of the clay, The awful Fatherhood of God which lights this ghastly play; Whereon I find, in wave and wind, what cannot pass away; A bulwark from the billow, a refuge and a pillow, When friendships bright that take not flight bow as the weeping willow; My darlings often from my side, in tears and woe and thunder, Have gone with beauty and their pride and we were torn asunder; The loves that I in weakness human did truly form with faithful woman Have proved a bitter lot, And I dismated was, and no man Has lived and suffered not. But if the suns and stars do dwindle and in another dome New planets into glory kindle, God will abide my Home. THE BURDEN OF EXPRESSION. Dear Father, The lesson which I read in all— It thrusts its meaning on me rather, In every rise and nobler fall— Is nothing more than this; By scarlet cheeks' confession Or ballad or a kiss, The burden of expression. The person and the thing that court our seeing, May nowise rot in idle rest, But strive to utter forth their best By simple being. Though they may fight against the law And never know it, Nor sage nor poet, And struggle on as helpless as the straw Or feebly play Within the energies of iron, That do environ And crush to better forms the foolish clay. The sot, inmersed in sense, who rises up With red and rheumy eyes to drink And staggers daily on the brink Of suicide, as 'twixt the crime and cup He trembles; Still in his blackest bout Of basest orgies, lower than the beast, Despite his hideous wallowings resembles The maiden like a star In brightness of her bloom tricked out For bridal feast With all the graces ready to her hand And blushing over for a queen's command Or conquest—but so far; He seeks to say, as she, the life within And stamp himself upon the frame external Of the great Cosmos which he feels akin, And like him part of the Eternal. And in creation Thou dost dimly wreak, Or sometimes clearly, just Thyself and speak A word, a sentence, Unto the listening heart Which dwells in prayer apart; And, lo, one hears and rushes to repentance. The seasons, They are Thy varying moods and modes Which teach us more than fossil codes The splendour of the Spirit's reasons; And in the red leaf and the tumbling rain, Thou art fulfilled by joy or pain One ethical sweet moment. The lover smarting from his loss And groaning under the dear cross Which carries him, Though his poor tearful eyes are dim And see no mercy, might have guessed the no meant Thy mantle dashed before his gaze And amorous grasp, Awaking blindly but to clasp The blessed haze. The grim and gory Lanes of long battle-fields where shot and shell Have made a human hell, That dupes turn glory; These are Thy efforts marred by us And mangled thus, To show Thyself (though in distorted channels) Written on the receptive panels Of common Nature's canvas, wrought Into incarnate thought. Thy methods are not twain, O God—O Father, As I would call Thee rather— Above mere bliss and pain; The track of trial Which purifies and moulds the penitent In flames of self-denial, And purpose of a self-development; Commensal tasks and social aims, And private claims; The gloom of winter and blue skies of Florence, Self-hate and self-abhorrence. And Thou in us, O beautiful and best, For all our carnal groping And madness of warped will Which cleaves to bitter dust and weds with ill, Yet in each ray of hoping Art manifest. Perpetual contest of the ravening brute Within us, chained a while but never mute, Does not disturb the balance of all things Which if unconscious pant And press along a scale of many strings, Still upward and co-operant Somehow to some great final issue; And foe alike and friend, With every vital nerve and tissue Are woven with the death and pride, Though we see but their ragged side, To the convincing and consummate End. SECTION VII. Scarlet and Gold. SCARLET AND GOLD. Scarlet for lips and gold for the tresses, Balm for the bosom seat of all truth, Fire for the love and loyal caresses Burning and shining out of sheer youth; Snow for the whiteness, heart's infiniteness, Drawn from the deep Heavenly mountains' virginal fountains, Rainbowed with sleep! Ice of the winter, pledge for the purity Guarding a jewel sacred from strife; Terrible coldness, awful security Sealing the honour dearer than life. Scarlet for lips and gold for the tresses, Lilies for fair and beautiful arms Opening with shy and shadowed addresses Gladly to suffering exquisite charms; Roses for splendour, spells that surrender Wholly their bliss; Seal of all fragrance, vision and vagrance, Kind as God's kiss. Day with its breadths for gifts of her lavishment Not without thorns and clouds in the light, Night with its purple robe for a ravishment Mingling the flame and frost in one might. Scarlet for lips and gold for the tresses, Gray for the English glory of eyes Lit beyond dreams of all poet guesses, Fresh with the dew from dawning of skies; May for her moral, pink of the coral Warming her cheek Cunningly painted, sad in a sainted Aureole meek. Bloom of the grape, and summer for suavity Clothing her acts that nothing may bend, Iron for purpose armed with a gravity Stately to one predestinate end. Scarlet for lips and gold for the tresses, Breath of the ocean wind for her way Saucy and sure, the green wildernesses Wide for the freedom strong and her stay. Rills for her motion, rocks her devotion Rooted in trust; All that is pleasant, in her is present— Works what it must. Such are our daughters, gentle and womanly, Tender and fearless, faithful and true; Doing their daily services humanly, Giving to man and the Maker their due. SWEET AND SEVEN. I In the shade of the cottage she drudges and sings At her toil, sweet and seven, Like a bird out of heaven, Though a child yet a woman in trouble that clings; With no mother to help her, mid hearts as of stone All alone, all alone, Yet she waits on her father and works for the rest With her best, with her best; And for them bears the load and provides for the morrow With a matronly wit And the bosom true knit, Finding sunshine in sorrow. In the shade of apartness she suffers and smiles At the shock of affliction, For it bears benediction And in smiting it carries the balm that beguiles; While the glory of youth is a fountain of song Very strong, very strong, And it kindles the darkness that has not a name Into flame, into flame; And the child that for love labours on without wages In that infinite trust, Because only she must, Has her foot on the ages. II Mistress of many, Subject to none, Maid by a righteous resolve, like a Queen Forth to the fight she goes bravely as any Where is the duty or work to be done. Crowned though unseen; Sceptred and served with a kingdom her own, Blessing and blest by the heirs of unrest Sharing her portion and laid on her breast, If yet unknown; Bow to her, vow to her homage that's meet, Brushing away the coarse dust from her feet. First in the county, Last in the care Dealt to herself on her generous track, Scattering presents to each of her bounty, Open as daylight, enough and to spare, Not coming back; Beauty and riches and rank to her fall Doubled, divine by the charms that refine Charity knowing no boundary line Saving her all; Give to her, live to her glory and praise— Ah, she is higher than honours can raise. III She's always long And always late, She never did a tiny wrong Nor gathered up her skirts to hate; But just alike in pain and pleasure With cats and curates and with kings She metes to all the same mild measure In grand affairs or bonnet strings; Her modes and morals, joys and loves No more important than her gloves, By some queer squinting or distortion Lie on one level of proportion. She never goes Without a dog, And has no special friends or foes Nor thoughts outside the Decalogue; Distinctly good and dull her marches, Along the humdrum beaten way, Avoid the heaven of rainbow arches And sordid earth and common clay; Without a colour or a creed She knows not luxury or need, A mere appendage to her colley With no redeeming vice or folly. IV Downright black and ugly, Madam—aye and odd; Dreadful, yet a child of Adam and of God; Not a feature with apology for grace, Like a creature out of season and of place; But in spite of many a fault with a pinch of saving salt In that heterogeneous mixture, And a sense of duty calm singing through life as a psalm Not a fancy but a fixture; O yes, pick her all to pieces, Pick out every wart and wen, So unlike your model nieces Fattening for the marriage pen! Quite a horror, in the turning of that frame, Formed as by a madman's churning for some game To a sample past the rules of finished art With her ample waist and every shapeless part! Meant to be a scarecrow, made for the cherry-clack and shade, And in short a perfect shocker, Hardly with the right to be granted to a toad or tree— All you say is clear as Cocker! But when this and worse you utter In your slander's cruel feast, Adding too a limp and stutter— Give me Duty and the Beast. V Full of charms her little body, Nothing in it sham or shoddy Or with any hint of stain, But in spite of pink and white And allurements infinite With a little empty brain; Very sweet And very stupid, Though with all the arms of Cupid And a parish at her feet— With her roses and her poses and her dainty upturned nose's Challenge, which it's doom to meet. Snow and summer must have married And in loyal union tarried On her bosom and her brow, But no trace within that face Of one reason for her grace, Though we all before it bow; Very fair And very foolish, With broad acres at Balhoolish And a heaven within her hair, Every section worth protection and a figure of perfection— Nought but mind that needs repair. VI Priscilla is too good to live— Indeed she's ever dying, With care for weakness fugitive And errors round her crying; Her busy mop keeps plying, With all the labour she can give To send our sins a-flying— It is her one prerogative; But in her prim and proper sphere Which nothing vile may enter, She will forget the Devil here Who was the First Dissenter. And if she had a broader plan Or noted dirty dishes, And dwelt not in the tiny span Just bounded by her wishes, She'd find two sorts of fishes And some not fit for cooking pan, Or only food for swishes, And man at bottom only man; But by her crystal palace girt And with her white virginity, She sees not our divine has dirt— Though she is pure Divinity. VII This is the Baby-woman, see! So exquisite and artless, As playful as a cat and free— Though some believe her heartless. I do not know nor greatly care If she has real affection, Or but the semblance and to spare— It is not worth dissection. Her face is infantine and sweet, The life has purple patches; But when you are not at her feet A captive, look for scratches. She says most hard and cruel jests With manner soft and simple, And if a wounded soul protests She answers with a dimple; Her air is innocence and truth, As if all girls were sisters And she immortal smiling Youth— But O the blessing blisters! And so I leave her quite alone, A white eternal Kitten; If for these words I must atone, Be purred on, coaxed and bitten. VIII Limp and lazy and with hazy notions of her neighbour's due But to self devoutly true, Calmly taking all and making no addition to out stock— Not for orphans even a frock, Not a petticoat or particle Of one useful winter article; There she lays her pampered length And her lax voluptuous strength On the cushioned couch, and lingers over the last book With her warm white drowsy fingers and a dreamy look, Half asleep and half awaking as she idly turns Still the leaves, awhile forsaking toys for which she burns. Men are dying, women crying at her very palace door, But across that easy floor She would never once endeavour to uplift her languid state To redeem a soul from fate; No one yet has seen her mightiness Troubled, save about mere flightiness, For some spoiled and petted cat Or her new Parisian hat; Then those crumpled carnal members stir and heave the frame And from out its torpid embers rouse the hidden flame, As the mountain of indulgence in the glow that gives Clothing of a strange effulgence for a moment lives. IX Tired and trembling With a foot that falters on the ground, And with open arts dissembling All the burden that is always found, As she totters to and fro With a pleasant word for each, Cheering hearts within her reach, Good alike to high and low; Such is Granny With her soft and silvered head of frost, Not without an air uncanny To the children whom she may accost, But a treasure to us all With the wisdom rich and ripe, And the healing in the stripe Which at times may lightly fall. Never fiction Did devise a comforter so dear, One whose look is benediction And to laughter turns the unshed tear; If she fumbles now and then, Yet her misses are more true With the love's compelling clue, Than more perfect deeds of men. X Tall as a lily and red as a rose Never the same for a minute, Changing her temper or beautiful pose Ere she has time to begin it; Always at play in her will and her way, Laughing and loving and jesting Up above cares and our homelier snares, Save in her slumber unresting. Tall as a lily and red as a rose And as deliciously fragrant, Making the ground of each pilgrimage close Start of some humour more vagrant; Tawny her hair and alluring the air Wreathing her path like caresses, Making each boast he is favoured the most Whom she the latest addresses. Tall as a lily and red as a rose Not without petulant bristles, Pleasing and pricking impartially those Gladdened by plums and epistles; Breezy and blonde and provokingly fond, Turning on lovers her arrows Pardoned so much for the delicate touch, Coaxing the hearts that she harrows. XI Too old and timid and an hourly burden Unto herself and even her closest kin, She does the little that she can and more Than thousands with her peaked and palsied fingers And head that nods in sympathy a tune. She feels she has outgrown the welcoming That once outran her services, and turned The day to pleasure and the night to peace; And frets to see the puckered brow that gives But yet denies at heart the grudged attention, And lips compressed that crying “yea” spell “nay,” With side-long looks and whispered jealousies Of place and person. Life is one sad load For her unequal shoulders, and she bows Beneath the dull disharmony of things As one outside the world in which she moves And has no part or precious interest. Aloof from all as at a lonely summit, She hears afar the muffled sounds that break As on a distant shore, and in the shadow With great dim eyes of wonderment stoops down And catches now and then some splintered gleams Not unfamiliar quite and yet not hers, And then she gathers up herself in God. XII Mocking, gracious With enchanting airs she walks Through the world that grows more spacious, As she moves about and talks; With a malice Hardly seen and yet put on, When your mouth would meet the chalice Of her scarlet lips she's gone, With a bitter taste that fitter Seems to rankle in the mind, Like old sheaves of dead rose leaves, And is all she drops behind. Is she woman, Or a witch of ruddy frost, Admirable, whom yet no man Loved but ever loved and lost? Soft, surprising In the sweetness of her mood, Then she asks with tantalising Grace new passion for her food; And her gleamy eyes with dreamy Fascinations to you cling, Till you wake and with the ache Find you only have the sting. XIII Naughty and nice with no feelings of ice, Easily wooed but not won, Quickest to aid and not bought at a price Pleasant to all and to none; Wayward and charming and often alarming Folks of decorum and nerves, Yet from the wildest recalled to the mildest Mood if it succours and serves; Half of her kitten and half of her boy, Wholly a puzzle and pet, Treating you either as king or a toy Made to adore and forget. Fixed and uncertain and timid and daring, As it may humour her ends, Kindness itself and a torment not sparing Even the fondest of friends. Nobody trusts her, nobody hates her, Always so pretty and glad, Nobody minds her, nobody mates her, And she makes every one sad. Mischievous, merry, admired and a pest, Still she has honour and doubting Going through life and her duties well-drest, Playing and helpful and pouting. XIV She's all elbows and thumbs And sharp angles and edges, With a gaze more than human that measures and plumbs Your most secret pursuits hid by curtains or hedges; With an awkward intrusion defying seclusion, And gathering crumbs From your library ledges For the feast (not your asking) of awful unmasking. And she lives in a rage, every hour, every stage, With herself and society and its impiety; For whatever may be must be bad, Must be sad, must be mad, And by her to be mended or ended. O her whisper is warm as an average storm And as savage, While a cloud seems to wrap her imperious form In a passion to plunder or ravage. She is clumsy of gait but walks straight As her purpose, and never turns back From her dark and predestinate track, In her ire and desire Which no trouble can tire, Seeking fuel and food from her murderous mood While behind her she leaves but dead characters' wrack. XV With the stream and the multitude drifting, And with similar straws cut by similar laws To the same proper shaping and shifting, But with never a thought of uplifting To the blue sky above the sweet incense of love; There she goes, With her dainty particular toes That would not be aspersed by the drop of a puddle, And shrink back from a muddle; The same pattern as this one and that one and all, Like her sofas and chairs, regulation affairs; At the breakfast and ball And the afternoon visit and orthodox round, She is perfectly sound And delightfully small. Nothing wrong in her dress, nothing right in her ways Before heaven and God, Though she may as she passes just give Him a nod Now and then, but alas! never prays. She has plenty of body and something like mind Under pretty control, And a beautiful polish and paint on the rind, But beneath all the varnish and elegant garnish Not a trace of a soul. XVI One of those fleshly women with full lips Of summer, animal to the finger tips, With heavy jowl and heaving breasts that pant In passionate throbs they care not to conceal, With greedy eyes that chain you and enchant By messages of what they would reveal; A magazine of vice; a lustful face, That bursts upon you like a tropic flower In all the splendour of its crimson space And savage beauty and Satanic power Of sensuous throat, and large voluptuous chin That rocks upon the waves of her fierce breath Unschooled to keep its tale of leachery in And conquering love yet crueller than death. Large lazy limbs that fit the exuberant frame, And move to music of the glorious shame Outshining in each hot lascivious look And rippling from the mouth in rosy flame, Burnt in all letters of that human book And hanging from each little tag and hook. A furnace fed with fuel of live store, The souls of men that heat her raging heart And still fresh fury to the blood impart, She daily thrives on victims and asks more. XVII I was busy, of course, in the sweet of a sonnet, When she came without name, without shame, Unannounced, with excuses and worse—a new bonnet And her good-natured face in a flame; But I wanted a rhyme, not a pitiful reason Of statistics and facts And political tracts, So her presence and poke then were quite out of season And high treason. I was going to dine and with visions of wine And dear faces and turtle, When she popt in to hurtle A fresh tale at my head, though the table was spread; While she kept me in woe, treading on my pet toe, Till the dinner was ruin And the cook cross as Bruin, And each savoury dish done just right to my wish Was quite spoiled and digestion's implacable foe. I was starting by train in a hurry and rain, When she seized my poor buttonhole And held on, With some yarn about meats and the mutton-hole And New Zealand and freezing and sneezing— Till my last chance was gone. XVIII God made her, God bade her Simply to go forth and witness In her frailty and unfitness, As He clothed her and betrothed her To Himself and to no other, mate or brother; Simply with the message of His love Ripe and red-hot from above, From the sunny fountains and the golden mountains Whence comes down the Holy Dove, In the mercy and the might and the dark excess of light. So she went All alone because commanded, single-handed, With her one sublime intent Only to proclaim the pact And the fact, With the wonder of the awful endless act. Sisters turned aside, she went and still straight on, Shipwrecked on the hidden shoal Oftentimes till all but life itself had gone, To the goal. God bade her, God made her Like Himself at last, in perfect beauty Of a consecrated will offered whole in good and ill, And delight of duty. XIX Who is here, who is there, with a craze or a crotchet, With a mandate and mission for all, Or the last bit of news—she is certain to botch it— And the message that's not from St. Paul? Who is never at ease and is always in motion With her peppery tales and the pills of devotion, Up and down like a carrier's cart, In your street better known and more heard than her own And the voice of the backstairs and mart? With her curious eyes and inquisitive nose And the foot that despises our weaker repose Poked in any retreat but your pocket— Who is this, on each floor and at every door Which if shut she is sure to unlock it? To and fro, high and low, as a prophet of woe She keeps gadding abroad from the pen to the board On all business excepting the one That concerns her the most, like an upstarting ghost When you deem that your worries are done. At your elbow, when sure now your place is secure, She is dribbling the scum and the scandal; For however we chafe no one's credit is safe, And like creatures that creep in your innocent sleep To the bedside she comes with a candle. XX Ordered here and there and harried, just to pay a grudge Owed another but miscarried, everybody's drudge, Never stayed and still; Ugly in the eyes of stupid folks who cry her down Blind as confidence or Cupid, in her homely gown Darned with dainty skill. Neat with careworn face she flutters through the hostile house, Not a word of protest utters, quiet as a mouse But without its play; Worked from morn to evening, scolded, and by children chid With no kindness fenced and folded, even at servants' bid, Always in the way. Used, abused, desired, discarded as a worn out tool, Ridiculed for tears unguarded, never out of school Nor one moment right; Pecked at in the very village by the tattler's voice, Made a field for fun or pillage at her tyrants' choice, Till the restless night. Learning truths herself more bitter than the lessons meet, Shaped to graces fairer, fitter, at her pupils' feet, Gifts that do outshine; And by daily loves and losses serving neighbours' need, Lifted as on Christ-like crosses in her patient creed To the peace Divine. XXI Scorched by Indian skies, and pinched and pale With the burden of the years Writing in each line a passion tale, Fought afar with hopes and fears; Moulded by the trial and denial As of flame, To the texture of a true heroic sort That will somehow ere it reach the Port Leave a name. She has travelled long on sea and land And been tost about the globe, Which has felt the impress of her hand With the trailing of her robe, And is rich and sweeter and yet meeter From her touch Laid upon it like a queenly law, Taking little from the wealth she saw, Giving much. Scarred by sorrow that would shadow forth In the tightening of the mouth, But with all the fibre of the north Wedding sunshine of the south; Built to stature full and tall and fair, Out of tempest, fire, and larger air. XXII Scarlet-lipt with warm blood flowing Full and generous and free, As if summer prime were blowing In some heavy-blossomed tree, Where through queaches wild and reaches Roam the butterfly and bee; Dusky-haired, though gold threads glitter In the tangles dim and coy, Making those deep shadows fitter Thus to be a monarch's toy; Like a gipsy, who is tipsy With the wine of human joy; There she stands a goddess blushing Over with the life that runs Madly through the bosom, flushing With the fire of Orient suns, At my hidden hope and chidden Praises that she courts and shuns. Ah, the love, that through the channels Of her nature strong and true Mocks at social bars and pannels, Yet will drink its splendid due In a passion beyond fashion— If I only find the clue. XXIII Mark how carefully adjusted and correct Looks the frock that is entrusted to protect This most precious piece of goods, Hawked and higgled up and down and not worth your half a crown, Fashion's pride, not womanhood's! She indeed becomes the clothing meant for use And at last beneath is nothing but excuse For a life without defence, An apology for stuff lining mantles or a muff And a paltry art's pretence. Peg for hanging on the jewels cold as she, Or the fancy work and crewels that agree With a nature small and thin; All outside and labelled clear, “Going for so much a year,” Painted cheeks and pointed chin. Just the product of a little lying stage, Bubble-wise with tenure brittle of a page Turned when downright troubles press, With the lusts that fret and leap and if charming yet are cheap, Not a woman but a dress. Admirably made to order and the price Which the market may command, Hovering sweetly on the border of the vice Prudence only does withstand. XXIV Bow to the maid with a mission, Place for the mandate of heaven, Though to society's fission And with an earthlier leaven! Up with the woman, and down with the man Long such a despot and so egotistical! Cook him alive in equality's pan, Warmed with his own pretty fires Calvinistical! No more election of males, but affection Free as the breezes and broad as the sky, Room in a boundless new world with no groundless Barriers raised that admit not reply! Liberty here for the slave and the chattel Treasured and duped for a moment of joy, Ransomed at length and all armed for the battle, Fetterless, wise, and no longer a toy! Rifled of jewels and trifled with long, Treated as children to sweetmeats and song, Cloyed with the surfeit of sugar and praise Meant to repress her and not to upraise, Fooled with the story of compliments hoary Binding the wings that were spreading for flight, Now she surprises herself and arises Forth to the riches of honour and right. XXV Millions they say she is worth, but her hat Clearly a home-fashioned article, Kindness to all from the king to the cat But of mere self not a particle; Shabbilydrest, but the world in her breast Carried to toil for and honour, Just as if Christ laid upon her Care for the least whether lost or the beast. Homely of features but finding all creatures Everywhere fellows and friends, Working with God along paths that He trod But to His merciful ends; Bearing the burden alone as her guerdon, Opening her heart to the knife Edged for the stricken who suffer and sicken, Watching and living the life. Ever in hidden low channels though chidden, Runs like a river of gold Charity wide as from Love's riven side Out of her heart never old. Millions they tell us she owns, but her jacket Utters impossible things, Gives her the look of a badly-tied packet— Over angelical wings. XXVI She is one of the masses and lost in a crowd And just nobody still, But yet one of God's lasses and pretty and proud— The machine of a mill; A mere item in numbers and reckless and young, With some melody fresh From her maculate slumbers that trips on her tongue And belief in the flesh. She is ready for Handel and takes her own part In a concert or strife; And, though ripe for a scandal, at times in her heart Beats the music of life. On her head is no bonnet or hat, but her own Is the beautiful hair With the sunshine upon it, and carelessly thrown A shawl out of repair. And her dark eyes defiant that cheerily face The whole world without fears, Though they look so reliant relax in soft grace And will melt into tears. If her language is shocking and fingers can strike She is woman in all, And all hell in her mocking and heaven alike Lie beneath that red shawl. XXVII See not the ill in her, only the milliner Slaving from dawn to the night, Turned as a flower to the light, Crumpled and faded, by sickness invaded, Yet with some dew and delight. Up at her lattice she sews, Watching her shroud as it grows Under white fingers—no task of her lingers— Serpentine round her it flows. Look at the will in her, only a milliner Outside the tumult and babble and whirl, Far from the story of man and the glory, Yet by the calendar nought but a girl. Yet in her teens and as proudly as queens Treasuring stores on the shelf, All for a living with some left for giving, Working and keeping herself. Brand not the ill in her, should the poor milliner Play with the morals we serve And from propriety swerve— Say, by a hair's breadth—say, by a stair's breadth; Ah, she is only a drudge, And but a step is between heaven and hell, if unseen; Leave her to God, who is Judge. XXVIII Here is to the Bluestocking, All health and wealth and reason's dress And every kind of happiness, Except a husband and the cradle-rocking! She's half a folio, half imbroglio In that dear head with Girton pap So fed and fuddled, mixed and muddled, That life to her is strata, stones and bones And dreadful gases, lectures, laws and classes All jumbled up like China's map. And yet we love you, sweet Blue Buskin, With spectacles and skimpy hair, Not only for the spice of Ruskin— Your independence makes you fair. For you are English to your short frock's hem In teeth of thoughts and virtues bound in vellum, And to the last whorl of your cerebellum— Yes, though I praise you not, I can't condemn. And though your tameless virgin freedom Assumes a funny form And savours of the robber Edom, It makes a tea-cup storm; And we might better drop a lace or two, Than part with you. XXIX She is plain as York Minster, Weather-beaten and wrinkled and grave, Just a spinster, But a bulwark in trouble and brave; Though her dress might require an apology, And defies the commands of chronology, A born hater of nothing but sin. She is awkward and wrangles a bit and all angles, And her nose may encroach on her chin; Yet in spite of her roughness and manifest toughness, There's an angel within. While you flourish in plenty and carefully nourish The mere flesh on the loaves and the fishes, She may pass you a solemn memorial column Or at most with a bow and good wishes. But in darkest extremity When false comrades like rats are clean gone, She would fly to the Valley Yosemite To relieve you a bit or help on. She looks harder than nails, but can soften In your sorrow with sympathy deep— Aye, and often When we're tucked in the blankets asleep, She will nurse by the dying and weep. XXX Miss Coquette! She is pleasant and pure At her heart, though she still may forget To be always devout and demure When she could and she should and she would, If you only had talent to stop her And she were not a trifle improper, Our sweet privileged pet, the delightful Coquette. When I look at her eyebrows so arched And her foot that keeps restlessly tripping, I forgive her for casual slipping And her modes and her manners unstarched; For her dear little nose of celestial pose Is upturned to the stars as if native, And her mutinous lips and her fingers' red tips Are at times a delicious donátive; And though fribbles may fret, It is only Coquette! She is pretty, of course—it's her duty,— Though the brightness be half of her beauty; And when fogeys and frumps become dismal as dumps, Because she is with lovers beset And goes splash from one trouble head first into double, I observe, “It is only Coquette!” XXXI O, she is always careful, trust her wit and sherry! And sometimes not unprayerful, when disease is merry Among the sheep and cattle, and the roots look queer And men begin to tattle o'er the glass of beer. Broad-bosomed, with square shoulder to the storm she stands And meets its blast the bolder with hard working hands, To issue from it brightened by each adverse part Though with a pocket lightened yet with stouter heart. She notes with watchful glances weather and the maid, And does not lose her chances and is always paid; She knows the market matters and the proper price, And bread she freely scatters is no sacrifice Returning in its season to her profit book, And all the right of reason lurks in every look. By paring and by pinches grows the goodly pile, And with its waxing inches her metallic smile That smacks of prudent scraping and the solid hoard, And then the pious draping grace to bless the board! But still, despite her daily lust for more and more She can deal out as gaily from her treasure store, And to the starving cottage while she screws her pence She takes no meagre pottage if at pounds' expense; And while in golden vision yet the gain mounts up, She gives with glad decision brimming plate and cup. XXXII I know nothing so sweet as her pout, And the pulse of her patter, the chime of her chatter— Don't they charm away cobwebs of doubt, And relieve the worst pinches of gout? For the Baby is Queen in the gray and the green Of December and June, and sets all things in tune,— There is not a house furnished without. For the husband, if lord of the strife, Is yet swayed by his dutiful wife, And the will of the mother is checked by another— By the Baby that governs her life. Here is She, With that simple and innocent dimple inspiring no awe, Fair and free, But still breathing commandments and wreathing us round with her law. Can't you see, it's not we with our clumsier ruling And our old legislation and impotent fooling Or occasional sop, who are truly at top? We are helplessly feigning, While the Baby below is the prop And as autocrat reigning. We have Royalty, Peers and the Commons, the Press: But the Baby apparelled in utter undress, Is our fate and the State. XXXIII Sparkle through the branches of the fountain, Fragrance of the heather on the hill, Frolic laughter where across the mountain Carves the stream a pattern at its will Green and glowing, with its flowing, flowing, And the footstep that is never still; Thus I make my picture of the English girl Sweetly country-born and country-bred, With her sense of guidance overhead Shining through the tumble and the daily whirl And the shadows lavishly outspread, As the rift of blue among the clouds that swirl. Bright as breezes, when the water crisps and freezes As they bear it from the neighbouring well; Brave and merry, though the bird can find no berry And forgets the song it used to tell; Red-lipt, so that sweetest kisses love her; Gray-eyed, as the English heavens above her; With the freedom of the wind that lights her face, And keeps time with each imperious pace; Nowise daunted, howsoever taunted By the trials of her troubled lot; Fresh and fervent, everybody's servant And afraid of nothing, but a blot. XXXIV The spirit of a Dorcas and the might Of the pure matron (Rome was patron) Who mothered heroes for the death or fight, Meet on her comely face in one delight. The clergywoman! with her kindly glance That has sweet leaven of high Heaven, But yet can linger on the earthly dance And in the world doth conquer circumstance. All honour to that pleasant busy form Which in the quiet seeks its diet, For ever winning and for ever warm, And on her bosom bears the alien storm. See how she walks her humble lowly way And thoughtful carries help and tarries In cottage gloom alike to feed and pray, And gently guides the footstep that would stray. She never grudges of her little store And ready basket (none need ask it), Or pious precepts out of sacred lore, And leaves new light where it was night before. Ah, I have seen a beauty on her brow, Not on the splendid head attended By rank and wealth, to which the myriads bow— The blessing of the Lord: I see it now. XXXV “New,” but not “woman,” a sign and an omen, Sinister, sexless, ill-famed; Horribly rising from habits surprising, Naked, and yet unashamed! Turn from her, learn from her how not to trifle So with the sacred and sweet; Mark in her, hark in her where we may stifle Modesty under the feet! Never a figleaf, tiny or big leaf Now for the leprosy show; Nothing but crudity, nothing but nudity, Flaunting the blemish below! Masculine, muscular, coarse and crepuscular, Revelling still in the shades— Edge of impurity, saddling futurity Lightly with all that degrades! Nebulous, bibulous, crapulous crank, Daily dehumanised, frisky, Dabbling in deeps that are rotten and rank, Sourly unfeminine, risky! You are a rumpled black rosebud, a crumpled Scion of Sodom or Heth, Nameless and tameless and aimless and shameless, O you disease or new death! XXXVI Wan and weary, with the long and dull and dreary Gilded season that began without a reason, And will end without one brief regret; Lo, she trifles with the pleasant hour, and rifles Of their honey man and mignonette; Sips her cup of Mocha coffee or affliction, Riseth up and lieth down with malediction Of the most impartial sort and sweep, Drawled from lazy lips and mind that has a hazy Unfledged notion that strong language is a potion Ministering to relief or sleep. Not unloved by two or three and not ungloved, Though her stays and starch are hardly taxing And her bolts and bosom know relaxing, Dawdling on till the next tedious joy is gone; Sometimes flirting, sometimes by rosewater squirting Compliments opprest with sickly breath, Worn and worried, but by earthquakes even unhurried, Tickled as by butterflies to death. Bored and flattered with amusements, freely scattered And as brightly, on her passage daily, nightly; Seizing moments' rapture as they fly, In her fated eyes she keeps unsoothed, unsated, All the langours of Eternity. XXXVII Brown as sun and wind can make her, Not uncomely, not unmeet For the homely tasks that take her Here and there with mind discreet; With the pottage of the cottage And the endless conquered care Waxing stronger, in the longer Stress of strife and frugal fare. Motherly, a drudge, big-breasted And with equal thews and skill, While the babies unarrested Yet keep adding to the bill. All a tragedy's emotion, All a tigress's devotion Lurking under the plain gown, And below the soil and grimmer Seams a semblance like the glimmer Coming from a martyr's crown; Rough and rude as Nature nude, Shaped and shaken by the winter's Frost and storm to sturdy form, While mere buffets break as splinters On resolve; in act and face, Tossed and tumbled to wild grace. XXXVIII With book in hand, and on her guarded face The ten commandments keeping down the lace And carnal ribbons with their worldly ties That need the fetters of phylacteries, She seeks the early service; at the feast Always the foremost quite, nor yet the least In rapt responses chanted to the Throne Besieged by murmurs of her monotone, Like faint sweet incense rising clear and calm; With dim suggestions of the crown and palm, Above a cross that has a doubtful hue And smacks of pasteboard under skies too blue For heavens outside her fancy. Matin's bell Brings her grave legal step, and knows her well; And never, never, did she wreak the wrong Of absence from the joys of Evensong, With priestly robes and rites not all revealed To her monastic gaze, nor yet concealed, And genuflexions dear to the poor flesh Which asks abasement if it sins afresh. She lives within a shrine of painted glass, Through which the earth and all its glories pass And give her what she knows of human things— Blurred and distorted by fair shadowings. XXXIX Fair—yes, fair With the scarlet scorn upon her lips, And her golden hair Proud and properly arranged— Not a thread estranged; Words that can and do at seasons fall as whips. Tall and queenly With the cultured look, Like some blazened book Of a gentle and heroic page, Which has travelled down serenely Centuries of sword and song, And has gathered up in this last age All its goodly heritage. Faultless in the rich attire, Conscious of her rank And the awful blank Stretched between the mob and her calm crowned desire; Holding out the sceptre now and then To a favoured few, Suffered to ascend the starry stair Just a step or two within her courtly ken; If from that diviner bloom and dew, She stoops down awhile to lower air. XL Cold as the charity that with the purse Begins and ends, doled out so much a day, And has no part in heart or generous usage Rooted in love and that large sympathy, Which marries class to class and builds a bridge Whereby the humblest may pass into peace And in his measure taste delight; a thing Of starch and stays, conventionalities And parsimonious breath that in mid-sunshine Withdraws the welcome and damps down the fires. Ashamed of Nature and its naked bliss And innocences of stark healthy life Where passion is all purity; afraid Of letting go the hand that holds the rule And rigid safeguards of correct cast-iron. She dares not ever to be quite herself And ties her feelings to the forms she knows, The apron-strings of sour authority; But still is others' mask, her priest, her wet-nurse, Reflected in the tepid shallowness Which is her soul and whole. No liberal blast Beats on her hide-bound platitudes of creed, Or ruffles with its glorious challenge once Her calculated loves and pieties. XLI Under the gas, without credit or class, Reckless in wrong, Haunted by evil and taunted by pride, Slinking along; Yet with the shadow of shame at her side Always contemning, always condemning Her in her heart with the judgment that drags Down to the darkness at length—if it lags. Pretty enough for a kiss Or the gloves That your purse would not miss, But whom nobody loves; Friend of an hour, fair as a flower With the sentence upon it, Good for a jest—with too open a breast, But not worth a bonnet. Ah, on the pavement She finds her one home and her business and plot, And the life that is not— Venal enslavement; Though beneath brass and the reek of stale wine, While she is powdered and painted and tainted Fresh for her lot, Still is the spark of a splendour divine. XLII Beautiful thing, hiding the sting Left by the sneer in the bosom that rankles, Crippled and yet with the neatest of ankles, Sweet as a lark and as ready to sing; Ay, and as soaring Upward, adoring Love that has wried and disfigured her frame, Letting the shame Darken a life which is guiltless of blame. O from the eyes and pure lips of red coral Grace that is moral, Grace that is power Bursts into splendour and breaks into flower. Broad is the forehead, and brilliant the glance Whispering treasures of secret romance, Eager to ope the great tideways of hope Armed for adventure and fired to advance. Beautiful still under the ill Clouding her sky, Shutting her in to infirmity's mesh, Though with the thoughts that as eagles do fly Far from the bounds of imprisoning flesh, Straight to the glorious Silence that's God, over weakness victorious. XLIII Here is brown Jenny, Madcap and romp, Only a beggar—but give her a penny Grudged not from comfort, that she would think pomp! Ragged she is and malicious she looks, Saucy and stained with the weather engrained, Spurning the books We with more civilised tastes reckon high; Yet at her crossing, Yet with the tossing But of a broom to make gentlefolks' room Cleanly, to God she is surely as nigh, Simpering madam Swelling in silks, as are you with your purse, Equally dear and a daughter of Adam Under the common blue sky and the curse. Bright with her blarney the maid of Killarney Offers you smiles and most innocent wiles; But if she's rich in her glory and bloom, Where is the broom? I prefer Jenny, Towsled and tattered and naughty and spattered Freely with mud (from which glimmers the bud) Over all girls from Cape Cod to Kilkenny. XLIV She never had a chance; her hopeless life Burst all unwished and blasted into being, With every woe and foe that wickedness For ages educated could confer, And want with its grim heritage of crime. Damned at the start, and with a curse foredoomed To sin and suffering beyond reach of help, She sucked in poison with her mother's milk Yet had no mother; for in lust conceived She came into a world of hate and evil, Stamped as the devil's own indelibly, And herded with wild beasts and fared and fought For just a pittance, as did they and died Daily the death of shame insufferable And lied and swore and marketed her body To any bidder. Vice is meat and drink; She hears not once the tale of purity Nor feels its presence and exceeding power; She sees no gentle love. But yet at times There is a flutter in her breast of wings That fain would rise, and in her ears an echo Of distant strains and solemn symphonies Sounding through tears and maledictions deep, And then she sinks beneath her slough again. XLV Against the darkness thrown out pure and white She walks her lily way, A point of hope in horror infinite Where all are far astray. The night around her heaves broad splashes up Of awful inky gloom, And though she drains alone the deadly cup No shadow dims her bloom; Which seems to grow yet brighter and more fair Among the dirt and din, Immaculate in that mephitic air And sweeter from the sin. For oft those wolfish eyes that on her glare And feel the chasm so wide, Behold together with the cross of care An angel at her side; Or even the One whom blindly we adore Perfected by the pain, Who went Himself a blacker way before And gathered not one stain. But at her presence oaths to blessings turn, And all disarmed is hate; She goes, with mightier loves that in her burn, Anointed, separate. XLVI Most helpless of all helpless things, Thou baby child, Yet with a dower and awful power Enjoyed by every little flower But not by kings, Because thy breast is undefil'd! Ah, who shall guess The curve thy pretty wings may take When they forsake Their shelter, and in fear awake To see their own great loveliness, And poise a moment ere they try Their maiden strength and outward fly, Bathed as in all Eternity? O whither then Among the works and ways of men, Wilt thou with treasure more than gold Direct thy flight, Or where unfold Those charms that tremble to the light? Perhaps on paths that none have trod Thy beauty waits to play a part, To break a kingdom or a heart Or guide a wandering soul to God. XLVII A true Domestic! When her mistress needs Her service, smart and with an eye that heeds The smallest blot, and in the room majestic With company and silver at her hand; Then every inch a queen, Admired when seen As born to greatness and command. Observe the calm and serious face, The head Well poised, and each quick attitude a grace, The soft and supple tread, And in the comprehensive eye What dignity! But then When work is done and all the strain is over, She drops the mask and gambols among men The wildest rover, And flings decorum to the winds; and rude She flits and flirts, no more a stately form, About the kitchen in a little storm Of quips and laughter, Free'd from the stays of servitude And the hereafter. XLVIII In the thick of the turmoil I turn From the business and babble and knife, And the fires of affliction that burn Their deep messages into my life; From the hateful and mean, and I lean On the love and the prayers of my wife. For a moment my heart, Set apart From the strife, feels a mystery solemn, And the walls of a temple upstart With the stillness of cloister and column, In a wonder of white Infinite. And her saintly calm face of pure love Looking down From the glamour and glow of a crown Lifts me high to her summits above; Out of care and the glare and the carking Petty worries and barking As of dogs at my heels, To the blessing that steels. I return to the load like a hod, With new might and a mystical sight— All is mingled with her and with God. XLIX Omnisapient surely is this Funny growth, Half a man, half a woman, but scorning a kiss— Or a little of both. Here are Oxford and Girton boiled down With the “Martyrs' Memorial,” And the “Lady's Pictorial” With the cap and Academy gown; To produce such a curious cult, And result! I feel nervous and Mervous and more, As I hearken in shadows that darken To the torrent of terrible lore, Which this monster part cherub, part chicken, Ladles out from her store; Ah, I sicken At the thought of my ignorant state, While she carries debate Into regions undreamt of by me And horizons unbounded and blessings to be. Yet, it's well After all and I don't feel so small, When I note on her back in her wonderful track Just a fragment of yesterday's shell. L English mother, with the serious blue grey eyes And their sober look of England's clouded skies, Irish women do their part Pouring passion and the heart Into all their nursing and maternal skill, And the joy of fancy round their cradle lies; But you only have the secret more than art, And the will. It is well, to be an English mother's child Wrapt in folds and folds of care from buffets wild, Tucked in warmly safe and sound With her jealousy around, Shielded from the shadow of a fear or fall And the evil glance or touch that had defil'd, Cuddled to her very life and all enwound With her all. Oft I long to feel an English mother's breast, In the many hours of darkness and unrest; And with this dull fretting pain To be rocked awhile again, On the sweetest pillow which to Heaven is clue; And when I by earthly care am overprest, Just to see in English eyes as washed by rain God's grey blue. LI Is it daytime, darling, is it night Under that sealed curtain where no hour is certain, Though it's always light? Dost thou mark the morning with its grey adorning Strewing pearls upon the eastern sky, As a carpet for the sun On his royal way to run, In the circle of eternity? Is it evening, sweet, or purple dusk Where the magic moonshine pours the waves like noonshine From its silver husk? Can'st thou catch a glimmer, when our eyes are dimmer, Of that vision which in splendour drops Over the enchanted Space Which is God's own blessed face, On the silence of the mountain tops? Ah, my dearest, thou dost truly note Ecstasies of being with a perfect seeing, Ransomed from each mote; Far beyond our gazing in a Dawn amazing, Thou dost freely range abroad and find Ready to thy heart and hand Glimpses none can understand Of that glory, to which we are blind. LII Gone the love that was a shelter From the cruel heat, And a comrade in the welter Of the battle seat; Where sharp fears, like hostile spears, Grimly on the bosom beat. He is gone, alas, and on Thou must weary for the sight Of some friend or saving end And the never-coming light; While the sun sits on the rock and rill, And thou art a bird dismated still. But a Husband for thee tarries, Waiting for His hour And the faith in Him that marries Thee and brings new dower; When things die, He passes by In the fulness of His power, Watching for the opening door And the timid outstretched arm, If the life in tumbling strife Feels His choosing and the charm; He is now a-wooing at thy side, And thou art His blessed heavenly bride. LIII They went down in the battle and the waves Swept over them and she, The beautiful and free, Was left to water with her tears their graves; But yet she lived, the little only— And yet she loved, the little lonely— One who should rather have been taken first; While all her empty heart, that dwelt apart And on itself was fed and on the dead, Ached with an inextinguishable thirst In its great groping blindness For drink of human kindness. They went down in the battle, son and sire And mother with the rest, All beaten, over-prest, And she remained to nurse the secret fire; For simple love that did not falter Burnt in her breast as on an altar, Amid the hosts of darkness and of doubt; And incense seemed to flow from her and glow Which made a passage sweet for her white feet And from each action breathed its fragrance out; Till the wide world was debtor For her pure life, and better. LIV She is nobody, simply obscure With a colourless mien and a mode Which is cut in the orthodox code, And is always discreet and demure; There is nothing about her, to doubt her Proper feelings and nondescript mind, And the baggage within and without her Is the same common dulness and kind; She can show no extraction or action That's above the old regular rut, Nor a ghost with a story nor fraction Of a skeleton drowned in a butt. She is nobody, one of the crowd, A respectable item, no more, To be covered some day with a shroud While the fooling goes on as before; There is nothing to flutter or smut her Or suppose hers a chronicle queer, Though she takes the society stutter And the latest society leer; No one ever will kiss her or miss her Or give less than conventional grief, Or for spoiling a character hiss her And despatch with regret or relief. LV The ugly Duckling! No one loves her, No one cares If she complains, the sheep-dog shoves her Aside and victuals with her shares; But takes of course the larger section With the best, And growls at any weak objection Or arrest. And all the earth is singing, singing, Nor heeds her trouble and the wrong, And all the bells are ringing, ringing, In Nature's church to evensong. The ugly Duckling! No one holds her Little hand, Or pats her freckled cheek and folds her Safe up and snug in Babyland; Friends always pass her by and blessings Miss her lot, The cat gets kindness and caressings She does not; But God is King and reigning, reigning Above our cruel creeds in Love, And past these mists of feigning, feigning, He counts her beautiful above. LVI By gaslit shops and shelves she passes With ragged form and famished eyes, And mirrored sees in magic glasses Another earth and other skies; And, with the lone damp pavement stone Her chill companion and her bread, She feels the stark and deadly dark With numbing fingers like the dead. But men are laughing, women quaffing, The cup of nectar full and deep, While some have clothing, some have nothing, And others only death or sleep. Moved on she paces up and down And hears the babble of the feast, Or rustling of some silken gown And envies even the fatted beast. She wonders why her bitter cry Still goes to Heaven and wins no help, And deaf to need yet thousands heed The pampered lapdog's lazy yelp. And through the rifting night her drifting Life vanishes in mist once more, Beneath the scourges of the surges That beat on earth's old burial shore. LVII She is pleasant to flirt with perhaps for an hour And perhaps for a minute or two, But that face like an angel's can yet look as sour As a Tartar's with murder to do. Then she bustles and hustles You out of the room, And her skirt in a tempest of black With a crisping and wisping Suggestive of doom, Flies afar till the boards even crack. She has tantrums and tiffs and with her you must take them, But I think she's as pretty as God ever makes them. There's no humbug about her, you know what you've got, And for baggage like that dearly pay; You will have a good meal and delightfully hot, And a temper that goes its sweet way. She's not painted or tainted With folly and fluff And indulges no vice, I am sure; By most pressing caressing, No powder or stuff Will come off—she is simple and pure. If you don't mind the sauce and the sharpest of pepper, She's a thoroughbred filly and beautiful stepper. LVIII Most gentle and all-perfect lady, Queen among women, yet Preferring cloisters shy and shady— Whom none that see forget; As often Nature dimly weaves A rose, that's hidden by its leaves. O excellent fair Dorothy, Thy touch so tender in affliction Is patent of nobility, Thy breath is only benediction; And in thy heart, which dwells apart, Is love that loves exceedingly. I try to paint thee in thy glory— But then I cannot guess One half the wonder of the story, Told by that Christ-likeness. My hand is weak, my purpose fails— And yet I see the bitter nails. For now the veil, no vulgar pride, Reveals when dropt the sacred stigma, The piercèd hands, the riven side, And all the sad and sweet enigma. For thou hast borne the cruel scorn, And been with Jesus crucified. LIX Her eyes were gates of Heaven, her mouth was praise, And on her happy brow Bright with the peace which doth to God upraise, Was writ the holy vow; The sacred sign, so blest, benign, To which the nations bow. Carved out of worship seemed that humble frame, One beautiful petition, One blessing, like a pure embodied flame Which held in God fruition, And must adore for evermore But of its own volition. For on her heart's white altar freely burned A love, which wholly gave The gentle life which to its Lord returned Through self-denial's grave; And in its fall recovered all, For other souls to save. The virtue of the Cross, which from her shed The shine of benediction, Made the blind world the better for her tread And healed the worst affliction; At each step grew, of crimson dew, The flower of crucifixion. LX O, more than beautiful and best, Whom none hath truly seen In thy sweet naked glory drest, I humbly crown thee Queen; But not on any earth thy throne Nor in a clouded sky, We build who build for thee alone, But in Eternity; And if we may not ever know The fulness of thy face, We catch some glimpses here below In every woman's grace. O more than beautiful, the One Whom all so vainly sue, And fair and finished meet in none Though each possess a clue; I mark thy presence through the land In happy virgin fears, The whiteness of a wedded hand, And in a harlot's tears; But what thou art and whither bent Save in the Heaven of Love We guess not, though with pure intent I stretch blind arms above. SCRUBBING THE STEPS. She was scrubbing the steps as I passed, And she stopt for a moment and met My inquiring, In a look too expressively glassed Which she pardoned because it was yet So admiring. O her beautiful arms were both bare, And she carried a crown if of care— But untiring; While our hands somehow mingled by chance, And my heart began idly a dance Of desiring. She was scrubbing the steps—that is all— When I ventured upon a warm touch, Not defended; And I let a few compliments fall Which were fervent at least, if not such As intended; But they came in a hurry, like me, And I had not the leisure to see Them amended; And our lips got together and kist By an act, in the morning and mist, Soon expended. She was scrubbing the steps, as I left Her bright brow with a halo of joy, But unresting; None the sadder because of my theft, As if drudging were only a toy, Not protesting. And I could not forbear looking still Back at beauty, that took with good will My molesting; And I wished I could oftener meet, On my business and journeys, so sweet An arresting. She is scrubbing the steps, as I go Through the bustle and bother of days Yet laborious; While I drift with the feverish flow In the mire and the murmuring ways And censorious. For in fancy I turn to the time When I heard that susurrus and chime Not inglorious; And when now I plunge into the strife She is scrubbing the steps of my life— And victorious. YASMEENA—MY INDIAN FATE. Lax and lascivious, And with tinkling feet Set with sweet silver bells, like dying knells Of lost souls cast on utter Space omnivious, She gazes from the lattice down the street; Her supple beauty sways, as to the wind Some soft anemone, But holds hegemony Above her peers, a fervid flower of Ind. The heavy perfume from her scented hair Catches the breath Like odorous death, And with her bosom's naked blossoms She sits supreme and as a demon fair. Her mind is littleness, But her lusts are large And feed upon all hearts with subtle arts Or sport in splendid vice with virtue's brittleness, Just as a child may toy with ocean's marge; A veilèd tomb she swallows up the gold Of kings in revelry, And with pure devilry Grows brighter like a plant from burial mould, Enriched by every sacrifice of wealth; The cruel grip Of that red lip, Seen through its musky mantle dusky, From fame and fortune draws its ruddy health. Languid, libidinous, In her sandal wood And shadowed shame's retreat, at each quick beat Of her hot pulse, whatever we would hide in us She reads to ravish in unwomanhood; Each separate ruby of her costly chain Is but the vanity Of some humanity, The life of man, by her fierce passion slain. Mad tears and sighs are mingled with the thread That gathers tight Her limbs of light, In the gay glitter yet so bitter Of that rich robe whose stitches are the dead. I see her lazily Couched with wanton eyes And haunted looks as deep as doom and sleep, That through their curtained lashes glimmer hazily, As on a fallen earth might fallen skies; I know the storming of her lustful stress, A hell importunate For souls unfortunate Trapt in the toils of her hard tenderness. And yet I flutter to my certain fate, Lured by desires Like wreckers' fires, In carnal struggling joys of juggling, Compelled by love that is but one with hate. THE GOSPEL OF PINK AND WHITE. O the love of a woman is mighty, And the love of a woman is sweet; Though her pathway be foolish and flighty, There is music as much in her feet. So I murmured and knew as I kissed her, With the passion that madly had missed her And had feared we might never more meet. Yes, I thought this and said when her dear fingers laid Upon me their imprisoning bands, That were softer than sleep and half-bold, half-afraid, But yet almost delicious commands. O the love of a woman divine, it is human, Though inspired with a heavenlier plan, In its wonder of pink and the white, And the glamour and grace infinite— It's the story and making of man. O the love of a woman is splendid, And the love of a woman is strong, Like the tale of a truth never-ended And an ever-beginning of song; As he knows who with her has once mounted Up the steps of denial uncounted, To the heights above hatred and wrong. Ah, I blissfully felt as before her I knelt, She was drawing me upward with her, To the summit of peace where serenely she dwelt, In the beauty that nowise can err. O the love of a woman is given to no man Who is squalid and creeps where he can; And its glory of pink and the white Wherein God doth His love-letters write, Is the best revelation to man. O the love of a woman is fickle, And the love of a woman is fire; For it cuts as in harvest the sickle, And it burns with unsated desire; But the light of her soul which I bathed in And the purity she was enswathed in, Were a virginal holy attire. Lo, above me her eye like a rain-washen sky Shone in pity that cleansed me from cloud, And my heart seemed to break in one conquering cry Which had burst from its earthlier shroud. O the love of a woman divine, it is human Though eternity only the span, In its gospel of pink and the white And the visions that these do indite— It's the joy and salvation of man. THE BRIDE OF HEAVEN. My face was never meant a fortune, God put His treasure in My heart which no one did importune, And deeper than the skin; But there a blessing beyond guessing And not for every man's caressing Or any fool to win, He planted meet as meadow-sweet And sheltered fast from sin. He watered it with pleasant tears In trembling hopes and trustful fears And His divinest doubt, While with a tender hidden splendour He compassed it about. How could He hang a jewel fair As woman's wondrous love, Upon a fragile thread of hair However bright above? Or in the colour of a cheek Supremely ripe and rounded, Till it in grace abounded, As roseleaves with no charms to seek? He does not dwell on lips of scarlet, Or look from eyes of gray and starlit. And yet I sometimes pine for blisses Which I have never known, The maddening throb of maiden kisses Though light as breezes blown; The shy refusing and excusing Of wants one wishes if abusing, And sadly missed when flown; Consenting coy, resisted joy, Denied, yet all one's own. My mouth has felt no passion thrill Nor struggled with the amorous ill Desired when least empowered, Nor glowed at rapture of the capture Which left its dew deflowered. Men only mark the beauty's paint, The outward bloom and pride, While these may cloke a poison taint And shame and death inside. I know an angel in me dwells With radiant form and features, Unlike these surface creatures Made up of poor and passing spells. The earth must take its sordid leaven, But I'm betrothed the Bride of Heaven. DESIRABLE. Dear and desirable and most admirable, Fairest of all fair things Without the thorn and woman-born, Though with the angel wings! O white and comely maiden whom tenderly I greet, Thy mouth is honey-laden, a cup that's crimson-sweet; Thy round cheek's perianth is like the amaranth And touched with gentle rose, Nor spray upon green willow had ever such a pillow As thy serene repose. I know thy dainty kisses which rush to scarlet blisses Are past my earthly count, Who boldly ventured first to slake my human thirst At that celestial fount. Bright and most beautiful, delicate, dutiful In every virgin grace Of moulded flesh, and dewy-fresh As dawn's young opening face! My daring lips were foremost to marry thine, and win The charms which I adore most and deeper than red skin. I will not deem that bloom shall ever know of doom And fade as common flowers, Or those long dusky lashes can pass to earth and ashes With their shy shadowed bowers. Let others leave no relic who lack thy gifts angelic, If unto me not fair; Thou never canst go by, who hauntest land and sky, And lightest all the air. BROWN DIAMONDS. There are Brown Diamonds, And I who speak have seen and handled them; Yes, at Lord Briamond's, In that tremendous crush Like strawberries and cream, one white rose blush, I found a beauty, quite a perfect gem— The purest water; Ah, you can guess, it was the Merchant's daughter, Poor little dear, With the suspicion of a tear Just bridled back, led as a lamb to slaughter— Got up resplendent, and half fun, half fear. Her first young outing— And so she looked a victim scared and shy, With pretty pouting; Alas, there's many a slip, Between the kiss and the sweet scarlet lip! And diamonds clearly shone, in each brown eye. But she seemed puzzled, As wondering if the men were really muzzled By social rites And took decorous bites, Or fancying by mistake they might have guzzled Among the dainties there such modest mites. Yet she was pliable, I found, when fairly introduced—and then So undeniable, Her charm and fortune sure; For she was heiress, proper and demure, Herself, not at the mercy of a pen! She sweetly prattled Of protoplasm and stocks and downright tattled, Though looking down; And she was gipsy brown To her warm finger tips, and diamonds battled With the bright lustre of her gorgeous gown. Her hair was russet, And, if by Röntgen's rays I could have seen, Each seam and gusset Would have appeared the same; Her glowing cheeks were truly a brown flame, Her mouth dropt pearls of wisdom and between A rarer jewel Like diamonds, sometimes, and as clear and cruel. Her graces ripe, I tell you, were enough to wipe Out all the image of the Siren Sewell— I even forgot for once my precious pipe. YVONNE. Most beautiful, most rare, Crowned beyond reach of care With brighter charm of eye and arm, Than woman ever bare. No bud, but a white blossom Of brow and ripened bosom, Thou showest yet new graces And pride is in thy paces. O still go gladly on, In all the magic of thy might Woven of day and deepest night, Yvonne. Most delicate, most dear, Thy face is calmly clear, Yet the gray sky of mystery Is shadowed forth in fear. For in those conquering glances Where joy superbly dances, Lurks low another vision As if divine derision. For light, that never shone Before on any human head, Is from thy splendid pathway spread Yvonne. Most exquisite, most fair, Wrought of delight and air And every sweet, in form and feet, And the wide world's despair. As from the sun the noonshine, And out of dark the moonshine, Thou of thy glory givest And in each rapture livest. When lesser gifts are gone, Thine hardly have begun to be And gather more than art can see, Yvonne. Most wonderful, most white, No thorns of petty spite Do mar thy years above our tears, In freshness infinite. Though from the dazzling dimness Surge up, at times, in grimness Gaunt shapes and grisly shadows, Like clouds on summer meadows. But still walk greatly on, And leave the earth a lovelier sheen Where thou hast but a moment been, Yvonne. CLEMENCY SNOW. Ah, I do not remember the year that she came— Clemency Snow! But the woods were all burning in russet and flame, And the birds and the breezes made songs of her name— Clemency Snow! From her Puritan vesture white hands with the gesture Of a queenly commanding that brooked no withstanding Glanced out and compelled any will that rebelled, Or disputed the conquests of Clemency Snow. It was magic and mischief and all that was fair, With the breath of the moorland and sweet of the air— Clemency Snow. But she looked so demure, and her delicate chin— Clemency Snow! Had the least little curve which to malice is kin, And it testified clearly against every sin— Clemency Snow! While the culprit before her was made to adore her, Feeling mere dust and ashes if wrath fell in flashes That pointed him right from their curtain of night; For no evil might sojourn with Clemency Snow. There was frost of the winter and passion of fire, In that prudent demeanour and proper attire— Clemency Snow. She was gentle and yet had an adamant will— Clemency Snow! While she knew I was foolish and tempted by ill, And had gone to the devil and followed him still— Clemency Snow! So she spoke to me plainly and argued not vainly Of the faith that was dearer, till Heaven drew nearer; But the iron, that dwelt in the softness, I felt; And I yielded at once to pure Clemency Snow. O she came and she saw and she conquered and went, And I found a new spirit a treasure unspent— Clemency Snow. And so now when the autumn is painting the leaves, Clemency Snow! I see blessing the harvest and shining from sheaves, And hear whispering sweetly from corners and eaves— Clemency Snow! And her eyes of grey gleaming in visions of dreaming Beam with beauty and power, and lips like a flower Open ripe and as red, and like perfume is shed Words of warning and comfort from Clemency Snow. 'Tis religion and sorcery mingled in one, And the promise of poems that never were done— Clemency Snow. DOLLY. Do you know my Dolly darling, Dolly darling, Like a birdie on her way Through the day, Good for nothing but to play; Like a noisy little starling, Now upon the gabled roof Quite aloof, Now a shadow On the meadow, Always busy on the wing, Always ripe to romp and sing? O she patters, And she chatters Up and down the oaken stair, Like a bird Or wingèd word With the sunshine in her hair; And I fear, when she gets bolder Plumes will bud ere she is older From each dainty little shoulder— As they may, And she then will fly away, Like a starling, For she is my Dolly darling, Dolly darling. Don't you know my darling Dolly, Darling Dolly With her big eyes opened wide In their pride, Which the golden tangles hide, Dear as innocence and folly Can make baby girly things Without wings, Who have beauty For their duty, Whereto girly things are born As its blushes for the morn? O she rustles And she bustles In and out my study door, With her hands' Pink soft commands Tracing figures on the floor; Wooing me with her wee stature Back to the pure founts of Nature, Mirth and life's young legislature, Where the sweet And the bitter mix, and meet Love and folly; For she is my darling Dolly Darling Dolly. Do you know my Dolly darling, Dolly darling, Playmate of the birds and bees And the trees, And the flowers that kiss her knees, And the wind of winter snarling Idly at her tiny toes, As she goes? Never college Gave such knowledge As a woman child of seven Wrought of earth and bathed in Heaven. O the graces Of her paces In a music more than art, Past the years And true as tears Echo on and through my heart; When the red rose hangs its jewel On the rose bush, when the fuel Fights the bitter frost and cruel Tender snow, When the winds to battle blow And keep snarling; For she is my Dolly darling, Dolly darling. Don't you know my darling Dolly, Darling Dolly, With her wise and serious looks As of books, And with babble like a brook's— Lips like berries of the holly Blushing, while she metes with laws Stars and straws; Lightly making, Lightly breaking Worlds or trifles at her will, Calm in her omniscient skill? Still untiring, Still desiring Moons and mushrooms of a night, Ruling all Who come at call With a sceptre more than might, As a nun who wears a wimple, She can look as sad and simple Though the cheeks do laugh and dimple, And the pout Of the lips that crimson out, Flame like holly; For she is my darling Dolly, Darling Dolly. BABY BUTTERCUP. When the flowers of Spring came up Came the Baby Buttercup, Yellow-haired, With rosy-paired Lips that laughed in utter bliss, And seemed asking for a kiss— For a kiss That none would miss, Meant to make the sad life sweeter And completer; Each eye was a blue abyss, Dew and love, From founts above, Touched with something indiscreeter— Lowly fire Of earth desire, For a mortal not unmeeter. All a flower, and all a girl— In a whirl, All of madness, mirth, and tears Less of sorrow than of joys, As if ills were idle toys, And she only played at fears. When the flowers in Spring came up, Primroses and never-still Wind-blooms and the daffodil, Came the Baby Buttercup, Buttercup. Never since the world began, Or the universe, it may be, Was a Baby So divine as Gwenllian, And delicious In her fashion, as of flame, With her big and unsuspicious Eyes, that ever glowed and glanced, And with each new feeling danced; Whom the Daisies gave the name, When with her they blossomed up, Buttercup. For her hair was bright and yellow, Soft and fine, And just a fellow To the pretty celandine, And the flower Wherein butterflies and bees, Tired of holly-hocks like trees, As within a golden bower, Love to sup; Which is the true Buttercup, Buttercup. At her birth All took up the happy tale In one harmony of mirth, From the violet in the vale To the early nightingale, And in music put a girth Round her little world; the thorn Bloomed, when Gwenllian was born. Yes, the trees Romped and rustled with the breeze, And the branches clapt their hands Through the lands, And the millstream like a boy Leapt and shouted in its joy; And the birds, In the ivy and the covers, Low like lovers, Talked and talked as wingèd words, Winged words, The pretty Birds! And the flowers in mossy dells, Where the fairies wove their spells And in pleasant swoons and swells Chanted dim Their evening hymn, Rang their bells And rang their bells. While the dead leaves growing crisper In a sudden wave of life, With a wandering gust at strife, Sent a whisper Through and through the garden ground, While they flew and frolicked round. Leaves and buds and feathered things Laughed aloud, or shook their wings As at morn; And the Fairies in their rings Danced, because a Babe was born— Babe was born. And, ah, the Owl, The great flapping flopping Owl, The white staring barndoor Owl On the prowl, Hungry and prepared to sup, Hooted hoarsely, “Who are you?” And then answered, “How d'you do? Buttercup, Sweet Buttercup?” And just like a floating cloud Or the shadow of a shroud Through the leaves, And the overhanging eaves Of the oak, in silent state, Passed into the belfry tower As the hour Struck, to tell his solemn mate. And the mite Speedwell to the aconite Murmured, “One of us at length Has attained to human power, Though a flower, With the dower Of our weakness and our strength.” And they bowed their tiny heads On their beds, As at sunset they must do; And the cowslip nodded too, Nodded too. Gwenllian grew with the flowers, Like the flowers, Thriving in the sun and dew And each day some graces new With the showers. Showed their charms— Redder lips and rounder arms, Hair that with the breezes blew Brighter, yellower; And her baby talk waxed mellower, When she woke into a queen With the sheen And the circumstance of courts, Not despising spoils or sports, And in ruling waxed adepter With her sceptre. She became a rose in June Fresh and fragrant, With a vagrant Love of being lost in corners, While she changed her kingdom's tune To the tearful strains of mourners— Daily lost And daily found, Where she crost Forbidden ground. In the most delicious poses Sleeping with the scent of roses; When with laughter she leapt up, Quite a queen In royal sheen, As if she had never been Aught but proper Buttercup, Buttercup. When she walked One little pace, When she talked With simple grace Just the first one little word, Most articulately spoken, And the infant spell was broken, None before had ever heard— None before had seen a token Of such dowers And such powers As like flowers (Only in her second year, And with really scarce a tear) In the summer time came up With the Baby Buttercup— Buttercup. Presently she thought of marriage And the husband made for her And the prince she would prefer, With a carriage Made of glass Such as came with Cinderella, Drawn by some dear patient ass, Not forgetting the umbrella. And when throned upon the grass Sweet and lazy With the daisy And her tresses all of gold, While her subjects young and old Brought her cakes on which to sup, It was often hard to tell, Though you knew her features well And her spell, Which was the true Buttercup, Buttercup. But the daisy in the grass, Meadow-sweet (not sweet as she), Wood-ruff and anemone, When they saw the baby pass Growing tired of them and zealous For new ends And other friends, All turned jealous. And the passion-flower, that crept To her window, sighed and wept And cried “Buttercup, come down Once again and with us sup, Buttercup, Dear Buttercup!” And attired in her best gown, Lo, the honeysuckle stept Sad and still Right across the window-sill And within her chamber leapt, Looking up And through far-off future vistas, Crying “Don't forget your sisters And the flowers, You are ours, Buttercup, Dear Buttercup!” When the autumn came she fell Sick, and lay a yellow patch On the soft white bed and wondered Why she was so very weak And her breathing had a catch, Till she hardly cared to speak, And the old sweet ties were sundered. So she lay All night and day, As in some enchanted bower, Where she could not sleep or play; But one night she flew away, And recovered her lost power And became again a flower. In the spring she blossomed up From the cold Calm churchyard mould, In a glory to behold, And was still a Buttercup, Buttercup. MOLLY LOVE. O I have a little daughter dear Made of sunshine, flowers and dew, And my passion deepening every year Yet for her is always new— Yet for her is always new; She is dusky-haired and fervent, She is tender, she is true, She is half a queen—half servant And has eyes of Irish blue. If you suffer that or this stress She is most demure and grave, She is everybody's mistress And is everybody's slave— And is everybody's slave. I would gladly be her glove, For, though very small of stature, She has quite a royal nature Stamped with God's own legislature; And her name is Molly Love, And her name is Molly Love. Yes, I know a little girlie sweet As the violets in Spring, And the patter of her pretty feet Like the bells of marriage ring— Like the bells of marriage ring; She is modest as a maiden Of the golden times would be, And her lips with honey laden Are like cherries fair to see; And her cheeks are blushing roses That she borrows not from art, When the crimson flower uncloses And reveals its bleeding heart— And reveals its bleeding heart. Like a vision from above She brings happiness, and laughter That awakes the old oak rafter, And will echo on hereafter; For her name is Molly Love, For her name is Molly Love. Ah, I prize my little woman child, And I ask no better choice Than to watch her running free and wild, With the babble of her voice— With the babble of her voice; There is grace in every movement, There is magic in her hair, And her pose defies improvement— Any painter might despair; While the colour falls and rises On her perfect rounded cheek, With the sweetest of surprises You would elsewhere idly seek— You would elsewhere idly seek. She goes cooing like a dove, And no sun may brown or pimple Her soft face's precious dimple And the smile divinely simple; While her name is Molly Love, While her name is Molly Love. Let the other darlings have their due, They are blessings and are blest, But she only has the fairy clue That can open every breast— That can open every breast; She can cheat the wisest pigeon And it answers to her call, And her life is a religion With its innocence in all; And about her breathes the scenting Of the blossom we term bliss, And her red lips drop relenting If you only look a kiss— If you only look a kiss. When she loses hat or glove, She will peep at me suspicious With a pout that is delicious And a murmur half seditious; Though her name is Molly Love, Though her name is Molly Love. DAISY. In the morning, Daisy Always wakes me with the bliss Of a calculated kiss, When my thoughts are hazy And I cannot guess the time, And her greeting seems the chime Of the water and the wind In some distant land of Ind; With the morning, fancies Come with her and lightly play Just a moment by the way, Till the whole world dances. In the evening, Daisy Is awakened with a kiss Which she never takes amiss, Though so tired and lazy. And her little crown of gold Just assumes my fingers' mould, As I smooth the baby head Carried gently off to bed. With the evening stories Visit her, and make her room B ossom big from all its gloom; Into boundless glories. In the winter, Daisy Cuddled up before the fire Deems the world in gray attire Must have quite gone crazy; Wonders why upon the eaves Bristles ice, and all the leaves Making such delightful bowers Have departed with the flowers; With the winter, shadows Take for her surprising shapes, And in ghostly hoods and capes Wave on woods and meadows. In the summer, Daisy Wanders all among the trees With the butterflies and bees, Through the green and mazy Circuits of the garden walk, Bubbling out in baby talk, Till the birds on every stem Think that she belongs to them. With the summer beauty Of the laughing earth and skies Pours into her face and eyes, And to love is duty. ENGLISH MARY. O I love a maiden nice and neat And she is my English Mary, And should others charm and also cheat She is earthly too if airy; And if one is fickle as a flame, Or if one is never still, She has no deceit and is the same In her deeds as in her will; She has not the fancies of a prude Nor the mischief of an elf, She could never be a romp or rude, She must always be herself. And she shows her nature frank and nude— She must always be herself. For her eyes are English gray, And she has the English way Of just knowing What is owing And about her duties going, As if working were to pray— As if working were to pray. O she is a maiden neat and nice And without caprices airy, If I kiss her once I kiss her twice, For she is my English Mary. O I love a maiden tried and true And she is my English Mary, Like a rosebud with a touch of rue And with thorns that make one wary. For she is too modest to be cheap And too prudent to be caught, While she looks before she takes her leap And she never could be bought. When her busy hands from morn to night Are with useful tasks employed, With the luring song, with swallow flight, She is not to be decoyed— With the golden cage and perch of light, She is not to be decoyed. For her eyes are English gray, And she has the English way Of just doing Without wooing Tasks, as doves perform their cooing, As if working were to play— As if working were to play. O she is a maiden true and tried And in wiser aspects wary, But the kiss I ask is not denied, For she is my English Mary. O I love a maiden pure and strong And she is my English Mary, And her voice is as a summer song Which the moods of April vary. And she has the grace of common things Like the blesséd air and light, With a sweet suspicion as of wings And a gift of second sight. And her pleasures have a sadness blent With the beauty of their tone And the glory of their gay intent, Like the shadow on a throne— But it only crowns her brave consent, Like the shadow on a throne. For her eyes are English gray, And she has the English way Of just lightly Bearing brightly All that comes and acting rightly, As if working were to pray— As if working were to pray. O she is a maiden strong and pure And her likings do not vary, When I kiss her cheek she looks demure, For she is my English Mary. O I love a maiden free and bright And she is my English Mary, And her nut-brown hair is my delight Though its charms are often chary. She is sober, serious, she is glad, As if January and June Here a merry meeting somehow had And been married to one tune. And she always says the proper word In the only proper style, And is sweetly felt if yet unheard When you cannot see her smile, With the precious fragrance she has stirred— When you cannot see her smile. For her eyes are English gray, And she has the English way Of just rolling And controlling All the world, to pay her tolling; As if working were to play, As if working were to play. O she is a maiden bright and free If her kindness can be chary, Though she never keeps a kiss from me, For she is my English Mary. THE LILY CHILD. Have you seen my pure white Lily Maid As if carvèn out of snow, With the great eyes opening half afraid And with wonder all aglow— With a question that abides unsaid, And a heart of fire below? She goes walking, She goes talking Like a queen in royal dress, In her lustred Locks and clustered Crown of girly loveliness. She is delicate and fragile, wrought Of the sunbeams and the air, With a lambent fire of feeling caught In the tangles of her hair; And she looks a clear incarnate thought, Which is made for ever fair. O her face is like a lily bell, It is beautiful and sweet, And her voice reflects the rippling swell When the wind and water meet With a message that no words can tell— There is music in her feet. All the lightness And the brightness Of the matin birds she takes, And her vestures Of their gestures And their innocence she makes. For she loves the dawn, and sunny things Are the comrades of her play, From the bee that in its blossom swings To the rosebud in its ray, And a glory like a garment clings To the daughter of the day. And she is a pure white lily gem With the passion breaking out, As the radiance from a floweret stem And the little buds that pout— Ah, it decks her like a diadem And it wraps her round about. Not in moonshine, But with noonshine Does her spirit sparkle up, In the laughing Light, as quaffing Life from Nature's brimming cup. And the earthly dress most softly lies On her soul of secret flame, Which escapes like prayer from her big eyes While instinct in all her frame, Like a vision of forgotten skies, As she lisps the Blesséd Name. THE PANSY MAID. She is shy as mosses shaded By the thickest woodland eaves, Where the glimmering beams are braided With the glooming of the leaves. But she has a perfume all her own, And a beauty to her dear ones known That is granted but to few, And her quiet graces shine the best When she cradles on the evening's breast With the twilight and the dew. And she likes in dim recesses With the birdies to be laid, For the butterflies' caresses, And she is the Pansy Maid. She is quaint and sad and sober, And a mingling of the May With the sadness of October And the glory ere decay. O she smiles, but babbles not as much As my other children, and her touch Has a magic more than art; For it turns to kindness all it can, Though it is not conscious of a plan, And it trembles on the heart. She is silent, but her fancies Are most eloquent if staid, For her life is all romances, And she is the Pansy Maid. Ah, I love to catch her dreaming In some sheltered rosy nook, And to mark the stories gleaming On her face's picture book. When she wanders through enchanted halls, And the echoes of dim trumpet calls To her hearing come from far, At the challenge down the ages sent With its troubled tidings yet unspent, As the iron gates unbar. Like the clouds upon a meadow And without a word in aid, I see feeling's every shadow, And she is the Pansy Maid. When her sisters think of sleeping In the curtained evening hour, She is wide awake and keeping A sweet vigil with some flower. Her dear lips of love and crimson part, And her thoughts on some lone journey start Which she never cares to close, Till her rich dark locks and darker eyes On untravelled earth, with unmapt skies, Find a refuge in repose. She is drowsy in the morning, For her pleasures must be paid, Though her dreams are her adorning, And she is the Pansy Maid. ANONYMA. O the magic of the moonlight in the starry Southern skies Crowns her dark delicious hair, And the passion of the midnight to her large and lanquid eyes Gives the glamour of an air, Full of all dear dreams and fancies And unwritten strange romances; Grief that as you feel its presence waves its pretty wings and flies, Glory of a god's despair, Joy that ere you touch its tender dew and bloom and beauty dies With the flutter Of its utter Ravishment and ecstasies. But I rather far would perish than betray her precious name, For if it were ever told Then her grace which is her secrecy would vanish as a flame And her altars would turn cold In the groves among the mountains, And the Naiads at the fountains Would go mourning with dishevelled locks and sweetness not the same And with faces gray and old; Ah, the wounded earth would sicken through the fibres of her frame, If one lover Did discover But the shadow of a shame. BLIND AND BEAUTIFUL. Sunlight never shone into her shadowed eyes With one glimmer sweet, And the rainbow's feet Strode not for her once across the earth and skies; Nowhere did she meet Angels coming out of the eternities; Not to her our vision Opes in dim derision Gates of pearl in Paradise, where shining shapes Cheat with kisses cold And enchanted gold Dreams that think the very thorns are purple grapes. Dearly still I loved her wandering through the night One with laughing day, On her shrouded way, Darkly stretching to the unarisen light Fingers formed to pray, In the simple faith more beautiful than sight; For the lamp she kindled Grew, though others dwindled, On the secret sources glowing in the mind; By some higher law, She it was who saw, While I groped among mere phantoms and was blind. Now she guides my path and I begin to see Something of the road, And without the load Laid upon me once rejoice that I am free, Nor require the goad Of an earthly passion, when I dare to be; For her pure affection Trusting is direction, And I humbly follow still where'er she leads On the awful ice, Past the precipice, Knowing not the inner gospel that she reads. Some day with her revelation I shall gaze On the treasures hid As with coffin lid From me by the dead world's thick distorting haze; And, though fate forbid Now, I yet shall triumph from this mocking maze; With her conquering kindness And illumined blindness Filled and fired I yet shall reach the farther shore, Where our day is night And the love is sight And it is enough to tremble and adore. LOST LOVES. I have loved the shadow and loved the shine In the wealth of a woman's hair, For I found the humblest fair, And the meanest glowed with a grace divine— With a gift like gold that no arts refine, And the breath of a holier air; Ah, I loved them all, Because each was woman, And I felt the call Of the passion human; Though one was in silk and satin drest, And one had but rags upon her breast. But some had a dearer charm for me, And some had a sweeter face With a warmer white embrace; For they opened gates in the world to be When the darkness fades and the discords flee, That make earth their dwelling-place; They had redder lips And daintier tresses, And a soft eclipse In their glad caresses; If this stept out of the cottage door, And that was queen on a castle floor. There was Joan with the dusky tangled head, With the ripest rarest mouth And a passion deep as drouth, And the pulse of the tempest in her tread With its wings of glory about her spread And the glamour of the South; There was little Fay, Of the pretty patter, And the light of day In her baby chatter; There was Dorothy with the serious looks, And Regina's brow like Sacred Books. There was Rose, just a fresh-blown English maid With gray eyes like an English morn, And the touch of a gentle scorn That refused and yet invited aid, Half-bold for a while and then half-afraid— And I sometimes felt the thorn; There was Una kept In her cage of riches, And Maude who had stept As from statued niches; And gutter Bess, true and good at core, Who was black but comely and drank and swore. TABLES TURNED. “Let us play at school, dear Father,” said my little girl to me, “I a thousand times would rather you, not I, should pupil be; Come, its only just pretending,” and she gaily on me smil'd, As she saw my face unbending, “I'll be mistress, you the child.” So I came, and without shame I took the lowest stool; Now, alas! I keep in class, and always am at school. Dolly sits in all my places and delights in all my joys, Or with gravest of grimaces turns my finest things to toys. Early comes she in the morning, big with lessons for the day, Pouting lips of scarlet scorning to resume the endless play. And I bow with patient brow to her imperious will, Given a store of curious lore and learning humbly still. Dolly has the softest sofa, and of course the easiest chair, While she teaches me my “Do Fa” with a most omniscient air. O she grasps the whip or sceptre with her dimpled baby hand, As she hourly grows adepter in the custom of command. And I hear with reverent ear as her obedient tool, Stories strange past mortal range, and always am at school. Dolly deals me cuffs and kisses by a sweet impartial law, While I fathom love's abysses with a dear increasing awe; She assumes my sternest manner if I ever chance to slip, And is the most artful planner of surprises meant to trip. But my cage of narrow stage is like a picture book, For Dolly's eyes are azure skies and have her mother's look. Dolly brings to me the treasure back which I desire so much, And renews the nameless pleasure in each dainty tone and touch; For her little chains are golden and like sunshine on me cast, While she wakes the blessings olden of the happy promise past. But I find my bondage kind, and as an Eden cool, In this drear and desert year, and always am at school. Dolly comes to me with cooing accents at the evening's call, Bent on conquests by her wooing words, at which I ever fall; Gives me tender admonition, which she is convinced will suit, Leading surely to fruition of some sweet forbidden fruit; But I dare not, and I care not now to chide her wilful choice, For her hair is bright and fair, and then she has her mother's voice. WEE BABY. Wee baby, free baby, how I sadly envy you, Kicking out your feet and hands far above mere custom's bands, Prison pales and blinding scales, or its pert and pinching shoe; I am waxing old and shy, I am half a century, Not your tender crudity; I don't utter sounds like oaths and disport outside my clothes, In your fearful nudity; I daren't scribble on the door, I mayn't sprawl about the floor. Wee baby, free baby, spurning others' bolts and bars, Heeding not our stays and dress in your broad deliciousness, Spread in state on dish and plate, or annexing my cigars; You can eat howe'er you will, careless what you spoil or spill, Checked by no propriety; There's no border to the deep of your appetite, save sleep, And your own satiety; I can't suck my precious thumbs, nor indulge in toes as crumbs. Wee baby, free baby, tyrannising over each, Parents, servants, great and small, flying to your faintest call Up the stairs and over chairs—ruling all within your reach; You can flout the fiercest claws of our pussy cats or laws, Nobody will hurt you; For your wildest work is grace—if you slap a Bishop's face, Every vice is virtue; I can't play the chartered fool, I must always be at school. Wee baby, free baby, if you break my China things, And that lovely Dresden dog or the whole great decalogue, It is just your simple trust trying so your angel wings; You may set the house on fire, and to your dear heart's desire Only be undutiful, Still whatever is abused your worst mischiefs are excused As most right and beautiful; I daren't crack the slightest code in one room of my abode. Wee baby, free baby, everything you say is wise, Everything you do is good openly or understood— Running pins into our chins or fat knuckles in the eyes; Every blunder, every wile wakes a fond maternal smile At your strange precocity, Every breeze of trouble raised by those naughty hands is praised— Every new atrocity; I mayn't ruffle nurse's hair, or her temper, past repair. Wee baby, free baby, how I envy you your bib And your bottle, and your throne where in pride you reign alone Swaying hearts with pretty arts in the cradle or the crib; You shall take your royal ease, break whatever you may please— Heads and legs and crockery; You shall riot yet and take toll of each delight, and make All our rules a mockery; I dare not dispute your will, I am quite obedient still. NO-BABY-LAND. In my travels I arrived long, long ago And far away, At a country yet unplaced in maps below— But not Cathay; Where the roses reddened not and life seemed deadened Though in June, And all being panted and the song birds chanted Out of tune; Where a cloud of sadness hung above the earth, And dimly crost Every face of man and beast, as with the dearth Of something lost. Backs seemed burdened with a hidden heavy load And bosoms grieved, And the brows of brightness wandered from the road Nor were relieved By one splendid error, nor dismayed by terror As they strayed; While they vainly hearkened for the hope that darkened And delayed; For the foliage drooped upon the troubled tree, And wet eyes turned Wild with hunger for the visions that they could not see, Although they burned. There the people lived and lived and never died In weary pain, Immortality's grim curse was to them tied An endless chain; So they dumbly waited in their lot belated Through the years, For the yearned for blessing that would fall caressing On their ears; But the æons dealt with Time as if a toy And still the same, Though they watched for that yet unexpected joy Which never came. But at first I wondered how they asked for death With every woe, While they held that boon of everlasting breath Their greatest foe; How they sought with praying for the dire decaying Of the mould, And for doom of martyrdom would gladly barter Gems and gold; Why the shadow of a secret sorrow lay on all And coldly threw Blight of bondage on the country like a pall, And deeper grew. Then my eyes were opened and I sighed, I found No children there, Though I journeyed high and low and far around And everywhere; For I drank no purling voices, saw no curling Yellow hair O'er dear foreheads dancing, nor white maidens glancing On the stair; Ah, I heard no patter of the busy feet That knew no rest, Echoing for ever in the house or street— And through my breast. Nowise there might be the touch of tiny hand In pretty scorn, For this was the dolorous realm No-baby-land Where none were born; Thus no room was furnished and no life was burnished With their play, And the land seemed pining for that sweet refining Childhood's way; Yes, a blank that only this could feed and fill In every part, Made a desert and opprest with untold ill Each empty heart. DORCAS. Her needle was the simple sword, wherewith she strove for Him Who was her only Light and Lord upon that pathway dim. But bravely did she face the foe and every evil spot, She was too busy far to know if she had crown or not. She never wept, she could not spare a single hour for grief, When all that world of cruel care surged round her for relief. They offered her most precious bribes to bid an angel stay, But heedless of their gifts and gibes she had no time for play. When trouble overcast her road, and fell with illness too, She heeded not the heavier load while there was work to do. She took her sunshine to the shade where sisters pined and bled, And for the sick and suffering made her love a golden bed. No conqueror's sword did half so much as hers by pity edged, Which carried healing in its touch with heavenly glory hedged. She toiled when others sank in sleep, her purpose was so large, The deep within her called to deep—two oceans without marge. Death often passed her holy way with service smelling sweet, But yielded like the potter's clay beneath her steadfast feet. Her mighty heart could make no room for weakness or for wrong, And turned the misery or gloom to beauty blithe as song. The tears that brooded at her heart yet never leapt to light, Lest they might do the wrecker's part and dim another's sight. And when her body came to lie down with its duties gone, Her noble spirit did not die—her life went working on. VENIT, VIDIT, VICIT! He came across the mountain, he came across the moor, His heart was like a fountain, and if in vesture poor Yet bubbled up with laughter and overflowed in joy That lit the whole hereafter and made the earth its toy; He chose the splendid chancing that kept his purpose strong; And every step was dancing and every word a song. Beneath him spread the city in all its palaced pride, Nor asked he man for pity, nor turned he once aside; The world lay full before him, and heaven about him hung Bright pictures to implore him, and he was free and strong; New glories on him glancing concealed the crime and wrong, And every step was dancing and every word a song. Behind him now the squalor of cottage days grew dim, And larger life through pallor of poverty to him With golden promise pointed and opened wide its gate, As if he were anointed for some imperial fate; He heard the horses prancing, he saw the glittering throng, And every step was dancing and every word a song. He felt his spirit rising and equal to the hour, And nothing was surprising when fancy burst in flower; It seemed familiar beauty, it seemed his native land That called him to the duty of some well known command; It was his own advancing, which he had waited long, And every step was dancing and every word a song. The riches were his treasure, the gallant pomp his spoil, Attending just his pleasure—the conquering of his toil; He dreamed not of disaster, he would not brook a fall, His faith was more than master of destiny and all; The touch of its entrancing would break the captive thong, And every step was dancing and every word a song. But then he entered lightly the city and its crowd, That yielded to him brightly as to the sun a cloud; The years like moments hasted in visions of a dream, No goodly work was wasted nor hope that had a gleam; The real seemed but romancing, each struggle made him strong, And every step was dancing and every word a song. THE PASSING OF THE PRINCE. I am waiting, I am waiting for the Passing of the Prince, They assured me he was near, And I dried the rebel tear Which was falling then and calling for his presence—but not since; For they bade me and they made me hope for something new and sweet— That would raise my little life From the trouble and the strife To a splendour true and tender—if I only touched his feet; And his brightness lent a lightness to their voices as they spoke In their fulness of his love, That it lifted me above All my meekness and the weakness and my heart in blossom broke. For they told me he would hold me for a moment in his arms, And upon me look and smile In his glory for a while, If a lonely child gave only these white lilies' maiden charms; And that blessing and caressing is the one thing that I miss, It would broaden my poor fate To a queenlier estate, And my petty life turn pretty with the wonder of his kiss; So I humbly here and dumbly through the weary hours have stood, Though I know I cannot see How all-beautiful is he, But his kindness to my blindness will be merciful and good. From the morning in adorning of their silk and satin dress I have heard the ladies go With a rustling shine and show, Horse and carriage to his marriage by my meaner lowliness; And their laughter echoed after in the distance as they drove In their pageantry and pride, And so near my very side That misgiving with the living burning trust a season strove; And the shadows on the meadows now I feel are growing dim, But I'm hoping still, if some May be doubting he will come, And the longer kept the stronger is my simple faith in him. I am waiting, I am waiting for the Passing of the Prince Who is perfect and most fair, And his presence in the air Is all fragrant, and my vagrant mood has never wandered since; He is praying, he is playing, he is tired and asks for rest, He is feasting in his hall, But will quickly know my call, And with speeding step and heeding care yet fold me to his breast; If he tarry on I carry his great love that cannot lie Like a picture in my heart, As its best and dearest part— In the darkening I am hearkening for his blessing, though I die. ANGELICA. Eyes of yellow— Nay, soft hazel dashed with gold, Each a pleased and perfect fellow To the light of love untold; Lips as mellow With their warm delicious red, As God makes them and man takes them For his own and bridal bed. Shy, And delicate—O yes, With each action a caress; Beautiful and maidenly, Made for many to implore And for someone to adore; With no movement not improvement, On the grace that went before. Cheeks of roses White, when sunset on them lies, And the daintiest of noses Turning to her native skies; Form with poses Wonderful and nice and new, Ever shifting, ever lifting Glories in their fresh first dew. Hair A tawny troubled mass, With the gleams that glint and pass Ere you wonder why so fair; Shade and shine that ebb and flow, Now in glimmer, now in glow, And dear blushes as the flushes On a virgin peak of snow. Voice of utter Sweetness, meant to govern man, And to shake the brazen shutter Of his most determined plan; Hands that flutter Pure as kisses touched with fire, With a quelling and compelling Gesture that restrains desire. Feet That never walk but glide As adown some singing tide, Where the wind and water meet, With a ripple and a rest, All of calm and motion's zest Mixed in marriage—theirs the carriage, Of the true Divine and blest. Frock of fitting Texture, which I dare not name, Moulded to each fine and flitting Turn, and more like bodied flame; As unwitting, It is other than a part Of her meekness and completeness Which need borrow nought of art. Bust That shelters holy things, Broken prayers and bruised wings, Seat of gentleness and trust; Cold to evil, but to good In its depth not understood, Likest Heaven with its leaven Of the widest womanhood. Life of gladness Infinite and strong and free, But with all the joys of sadness Which have been and yet shall be; Conquering madness And the moods of wayward will, By her fences' innocences, Ere they darken into ill. Love As light that garments her, Like a silver gossamer Spun in sacred courts above; Blossoming in every deed, And at heart the secret seed Of the duty done, a beauty Better than the proudest creed. FOUNTS OF LIFE. Only a country wench, and a simple Face full of rustic rest, Clasping a rosy ball with a dimple— Baby that nosed the breast. Framed in the doorway, there she was netting Hard at her double toil, Feeding her tyrant, sturdily letting Love into lips and coil. Gold was the sunrise, gray were the arching Heavens with wind at strife, Down through the thirsty throat and its parching Murmured the founts of life. There were the rent-worth pigs as they guzzled Wash with a noisy zest, There was the clinging baby that nuzzled Boldly the warm white breast. SECTION VIII. Thorns and Thistles. SONGS OF THE SLUMS. PROLOGUE. Dives, now, hear the Songs of the Slums And the tenants who live by their wits, Who know nothing of reading or sums And would send an Inspector in fits; Folks who live as they can, Without purse, without plan, At the cost of the wealthy and simple And more fortunate neighbours, The fat priest and the prude with her dimple, And by other men's labours; They have only one notion of right, And that not in the Bible—it's might. But remember the devil is not Quite as black as some persons may say, And though cadgers bear many a spot There is gold in the dirtiest clay; They may borrow your coat, Or perform on your throat For the sake of the pearls or the corals— If you happen to struggle, For they have funny manners and morals And are awkward to juggle. But just treat them with liberal sense And they'll toast you—though at your expense. If they hustle and maul you at times Count it in with the work of the day, Not that loafers are partial to crimes But it's only their ignorant way; For somehow they must live, And if Dives won't give They must collar whatever comes handy And will boil up the kettle, Be it Dutchman or drunkard or dandy,— They must prove they have mettle; If you meet them as human and kin, They'll be tender and leave you your skin. But they are not all idle and thieves And not one had your outfit and start, And the rogue who so lightly relieves You of money may have a good heart; Some are honest and kind, With the weather and wind, When these offer them luck and fair chances And the troublesome Bobbies Let them try more respectable dances And forsake legal hobbies; Though they relish no toil they can drudge, And would more but for jury and judge. LITTLE BOY JACK. Waif of the gutter and child of the street Strolling along with his bare brown feet, Spurning the bonds of society still, And hearing the clink of the tradesman's till With an envious twitch at a sound so sweet, And dodging policemen's quest with a will, Little boy Jack Little cares for a whack If it comes with a casual squall in his way, Like a pinch of the frost in the wintry weather, For he takes all alike in the work of the day And lumps them together. Only a bubble on life's dark tide Tossing about on the waters wide,— Nowhere a friend with a helping hand Staying his steps or wiping the brand From the sullied brow with no wholesome pride, And bringing the wreck at last to land— Little boy Jack Goes his devious track, Cropping up, coming down, from pillar to post, And as ripe for a revel as glad of a copper, Rising here, rising there, as an unlaid ghost Ever pert and improper. Born in a cellar and bred on the tramp, Bearing the stain of the outcast stamp, Beaten and tumbled along the dim road That the vagabond treads with his careless load, Hating the sunlight and hugging the lamp, With the constant prick of his hunger's goad, Little boy Jack Carries too on his back All the vice of the pavement and curse of his kin, As he slouches apace like a lamb to the slaughter With a passion for tricks and a weakness for gin, And a hatred of water. Motherless, homeless, yet he is brave, Never a coward and never a slave; Armed with a bayonet, broken in, led, Might not he when a man his life-blood shed For his country's honour he lived to save, And die for the flag on a soldier's bed? Little boy Jack, With his wondrous knack For a double share of the flouts and falls Which to him have a sweet and savage wiling, And for running his head on the iron walls, Though he comes up smiling. IRISH PAT. I have only a bit of a quarrel with Pat— Not of course that he's dirty And though thirteen looks thirty And is tattered and towzled with hair like a mat, Or is vicious and vagrant And decidedly fragrant Of tobacco and beer and unspeakable things (Not in vessels and vials) Of his native Seven Dials And the odour which to this queer neighbourhood clings; But my quarrel is this, and a suitable text, That you never can guess what his trick will be next. He is saucy, no doubt, but I love merry Pat, Like those nondescript creatures With impossible features— Head or tail either end, perhaps dog, perhaps cat; If he takes that direction, He will show an affection That your Board School phenomenon never could feel— At a wave of your finger, When a hero might linger, He would fight to the death and prove stiffer than steel; Though I own with regret for a copper or cup, He would greatly prefer just to double you up. A true pickle indeed is the frolicsome Pat, For he slips out of messes And law's iron caresses To go souse in again—he thinks nothing of that; Ah, but he knew no other Than the street as a mother, And was tumbled about by bad teachers and tost From the arch to the cellar, Without your good umbrella Or warm coat betwixt him and the rain and the frost; And no School Board on him had five minutes to spare, With pianos and prate and grandmotherly care. There are loafers and loafers, but mischievous Pat Has the laziest paces And the oddest grimaces, Always lounging, half ignorant what he is at; He reads posters and dockets, With his hands in his pockets When at least they are not in some credulous friend's; For he likes Eden's apple And prefers his Whitechapel To Whitehall and red tape and the rubbish it sends; But he'd give you a “tanner” if down on your luck, Nor deny you his bottle or orange to suck. Under gaslight more often than sunlight roams Pat, With a keen eye for profit And what he may score off it In a masterly way at your cost with his bat; For he has the right ticket And will keep up his wicket When the bigger knaves fall at the bowling of fate; His defence is so ready And his batting so steady, That his victim mistakes him at times for a mate; And he plays honest rogue with such infinite zest, You forgive him the wrong and remember the jest. Oh, his Irish blue eyes are a fortune for Pat, And ensure him an innings In the face of all sinnings, And the fact that he never will wear his own hat; While the smile just in season Quite forbids any reason For suspecting his hand of the blow or the loss, And his innocent asking Makes the best kind of masking When he sighs of his errors and says he is dross; For you cannot find fault with his manners or smile, And his principles seem far above petty guile. If he seems least alert I am careful with Pat, For his doubtful deportment And paraded assortment Of preposterous airs, prove he smells out a rat; Then I know he is waiting, And I see he is baiting A sly trap for the simple who want to be caught; Be it only a carriage Or a meeting or marriage, Yet he is not the boy to give labour for naught; He will hook something good, though he follows it far, If it's merely the end of a half-smoked cigar. If he tumbles, he falls on his feet, lucky Pat, And when judgment is spoken Still he comes off unbroken, For the net holding mackerel lets outs the sprat; And he takes the brief sentence With the sweetest repentance And deplores with a sob the indelible stain; But though quitting seclusion With most tearful effusion, He returns to his haunts and bad habits again; For the passion, alas, is bred deep in the bone, And the wicked police will not let him alone. BLIND BART. Poor blind Bart Cannot see, but his heart Would make up for the desolate fate— And the shadow that shuts out the troubles Of the world from his pitiful state, And yet doubles; O therefore his lot Has a blankness as well as a blot; Though he guesses God's marvellous creatures, And shapes for himself while he dresses In glory and unfallen features. Poor blind Bart Cannot steal from the mart, As his fellows whose eyes are their own Though they sell them so cheap to the devil, But to suffer at last grief unknown For their revel; But he from the dark Stretches vainly dim hands for one spark; As he blunders Along his lone journey, Strange weaving of truth and false wonders— A knight without arms in a tourney. Poor blind Bart Cannot take a boy's part In the battle of life, yet he prays Like a man in the neighbouring chapel; Where the ranter on Sunday displays His bright lapel And fearful new coat— Where his greasy ineptitudes float; But the fashion To him is as nothing, He hears but the Tale of the Passion, And sees and is fed and has clothing. Poor blind Bart Had a terrible start In the race where the helpless go down, He is only a victim of weakness; And he wears it indeed like a crown With brave meekness, And bows to the rod As he gropes for his Father and God; His mean living Prepares what is mortal For change, and he feels no misgiving But knocks like a child at death's portal. DEAF DAVE. Wee deaf Dave From the grave Just keeps out, and no more; And the death at no distance He knew long before, Though no hand is stretched out once to offer assistance; He is chary of tongue, And has never been young; He was born in the world quite a hundred years old, And has now more than doubled That babe life so troubled; He's always athirst and is always acold. Wee deaf Dave Smells the grave Yawning close at his side, As the heretic faggots That chasten his pride; And around him and over him tumble the maggots, He dreams in the dark Shutting in with no spark; In that ominous realm where the sounds are as ghosts Far away, and a curtain Descends on uncertain Existence that's haunted with shades of dead hosts. Wee deaf Dave Loves the grave, And his favourite perch Is a jolly tall tombstone Beside the grey church, Where he trusts soon to hear the great trumpet of doom's tone; He's blasted and thin, Only bones and the skin; Generations of vice have left brandings that tell On his brow low and wrinkled, And queer spots are sprinkled On features that look as if hot out of hell. Wee deaf Dave Is the grave Of a mother's young heart; He encloses the ashes That burned out their past In a fury of passion and brief wicked flashes; High purpose, though dim, Is all buried in him; And he carries about him, for better or worse, In his pilgrimage muddy, Like beacon lights ruddy, The dreadful bequest of a homicide's curse. CHRIS. Fair-haired Chris Has forever a smile at command, And at this He is perfect, and none can withstand The bright face like a blessing, The manners caressing That twine all about you a beautiful wreath; Yes, he beams like an angel, but what is beneath? For the charms are a vagrant And transient breath, And the blossom so fragrant Is blossom of death. Merry Chris Is a mask of a horrible shape, And the bliss He assumes hides a lecherous ape With unspeakable vices, Whom nothing suffices; The jubilant laugh and the innocent look, Are the baits that he smears on the murderous hook; For his heart's black obscurity Is a black tide, And the love and the purity Are just outside. Golden Chris Woos damnation in drink like the rest, And the hiss Of the serpent sounds under his jest; A mere baby he follows The vilest and wallows In garbage of sin as a sow in the mire, And beyond his brute appetites feels no desire; Though he seems hardly seven For ruin he's ripe, Holds the gin palace heaven And swears by his pipe. And yet Chris Could be tamed, ere the mischief is done, By a kiss And with kindness might surely be won; In that nebulous nature God's own legislature Is written and conscience is there not yet dead, And the angel at bottom might still raise his head: There is hope for the purging His dungeon of sin With its passionate surging, If love would begin. JOSH. Poor old Josh is a miser And scarce numbers ten, But is yet vastly wiser Than others though men; He began with a shilling he found in the street And supposes the world is now all at his feet, And his serious life has no room for a smile For the shilling has grown and is quite a grand pile; Moses even is jealous And envies his gold, When he sees him so zealous In sunshine and cold. For old Josh loves his labour And carries a broom, And can tell a rich neighbour In dreariest gloom; While he is so polite to sweet ladies with bags And to gentlemen passing with fidgety nags, That he soon gets the coppers to add to his store And keeps pegging away at his work making more: Ah, you don't see him tossing His money in play, But he sticks to his crossing And to pitches that pay. Dear old Josh waxes bolder The farther he dares, And his brave little shoulder Lifts ponderous cares; There's a world of anxiety crammed in that head Furrowed early with thought, which is coined into bread And good clothing and stuff for his wonderful stock, In the bank of the teapot or castaway sock; While he terribly pinches Himself with his load, And proceeds but by inches Along his small road. Grave old Josh takes no pleasure On shore or the Thames, And he cannot find leisure For larking or games; On the Sunday he sleeps and believes it no sin, And allows but one meal because nothing comes in; In the straw of a packing case, shared with odd guests, Like a dormouse coiled up he religiously rests; Boys about him get prisoned And never will rise, He grows daily more wizened And wealthy and wise. DUMB TOM. Tom is dumb, Tom is dumb, And his poor little mouth May be pinched by the winter or tortured with drouth, And his body grow numb— But O what does it matter To others about him, who grumble and chatter? Tom is tiny, you see, And with weakness he trembles And dreadful suspicion he never dissembles— He looks always ready to tumble or flee; He is common and mean, And forlorn and unclean. Tom is dumb, Tom is dumb And his desolate eyes That refuse to meet yours have a savage surprise; And the dirty brown thumb, Which he bites in sheer famine, Would show bitter marks if you stopt to examine; Tom is helpless and lost, A wan fugitive hunted By all, and grows downward more wretched and stunted, In sweltering heat and the fangs of the frost; And his brow seems the stage Not of childhood, but age. Tom is dumb, Tom is dumb, And the veriest child, Though his lips seem as if they could never have smil'd; And he owns not a chum In that infinite City, If sometimes a dog may bestow on him pity. Tom goes silent, a thief, For his fingers are clever, And passes from darkness to darkness for ever Untaught and unknown with the gnawing of grief; But he's human, that blight Only asks for more light. Tom is dumb, Tom is dumb, And yet clearer his voice Tells to those who may hearken he had not a choice; It beseeches a crumb Of that prodigal kindness, Which beams upon all except him in his blindness. Tom would keep within bounds, And look bright with young beauty— If properly washed and just trained to know duty, Fed, clothed—and no more make those horrible sounds. In that volume though sealed, Our offence is revealed. BRAVE LITTLE DICK. Over the crossings and under the arch, Waif of the weather, Ragged and dirty and still on the march, Blown like a feather, Here round a corner and there down a court, Racing one moment, then pulling up short, Brave little Dick Yet behaves like a brick; Though he lives needingly, He bears unheedingly Frost and the rain with sharp hunger and thirst Always, to help his lone mother the first. Give him a penny you never will miss Out of your plenty, Darling, who grudge not the colly a kiss— You, tall and twenty; You, dear old lady, all muffled in furs, Kindness itself when your kitten but purrs; Brave little Dick Has too much of the stick, While he fares drearily Taking things cheerily, Singing and laughing and jesting his way Nobly, if built of a commoner clay. Burly policeman, just turn a blind eye On his mad capers, Hustling and begging a bit on the sly— Think of the Papers! Don't be so hard on him, you are in weal, He is not sure of a single half meal; Brave little Dick Far too often is sick, Starving on strainingly But uncomplainingly; Law must not rob of repute and of pence Weakness, and wink at rich sinners' offence. Here is a shilling! The devil take pride, When it is cruel! Yours is a soil that is mainly outside, Over a jewel; Iron the grit and most faithful the heart, Ready the wit and the hand with its part; Brave like Dick, Though your troubles come thick All life is vanity, And old humanity Cleaves to us last, and when earth's glitter goes Slippers of satin walk after brown toes. MADCAP NED. There was never a boy in the City of London Quite a match for its Ned With such hands and such head And for doing rash things that were better left undone; He was clever at all, At upsetting a stall Or a gentleman proudly pursuing his travels Unprepared for a fall And a study of mire and the nature of gravels— Ned was ever at home with the rackets and ravels; But his bosom could feel And was steady as steel, Madcap Ned, And he carried a kingdom of cares on his head. For he had a poor brother at home, a dear cripple, And so life for our Ned Was not all gingerbread, And he never could gorge and he never would tipple; For that suffering lot Kept him true to the spot, And he picked up odd halfpence and toiled at chance labours For the boiling the pot; While relieving at times his more fortunate neighbours Of surperfluous wealth they would waste upon tabors And the dance and the song, Which he thought clearly wrong, Naughty Ned, Who was glad of the crumbs of their gilt gingerbread. He could fight like the devil and did with all comers, But they could not beat Ned Though more furnished and fed, And his body was small and had seen but twelve summers; For he loved a good fight Whether foolish or right, And he hit out so straight and so hard from the shoulder With an Irish delight, While he liked a big target however much older, And the heaviest punishment made him the bolder; He was tough as Tom Sayers If he did not say prayers, Stocky Ned Not half clothed, not half grown, and not properly fed. But believe me, my friend, in a brawl or tight corner, I would rather have Ned With no weakness like dread By my side than your sabretached swaggering scorner; And no white kid gloved swell With his lavender smell Would have bottom like his and his cut-and-thrust motion, Or bear buffets as well; His the muscular piety, dog-like devotion, And a workman-like style with no cant or commotion; To the last he is game, Always there and the same Honest Ned, With no trouble of conscience or shadow of dread. “CRIP” NAT. Small “Crip” Nat goes on crutches, And whistles a song As he hobbles along Quite regardless of smutches Through rain and the mire and the down-beaten smoke, Brimming over with merriment and the last joke; He's a pure-bred albino And horribly lame, But he loves the casino And any wild game; If you want the new ditty just rattled off pat, Merely go to Whitechapel and ask for “Crip” Nat. Small “Crip” Nat will out-cozen Old Moses the Jew, Though his chattels are few And his years not a dozen: He is cunning incarnate, and no one can steal Half as smartly as he or surpass in a “deal.” Ah, his sticks are a treasure To him in hard cash, If you once feel their measure You'll know they are ash; Though they say that in dancing he shines as in chat, And there is nothing wrong in his legs with “Crip” Nat. Small “Crip” Nat has a curly Round head, and his face Is one comic grimace, And whoe'er saw him surly? His hair ev'ry morning is carefully groomed, With a brush that as rubbish might long have been doomed; Though the three or four bristles Yet left are a joy, As he carelessly whistles, And no vulgar toy; And he deems no possession is finer than that, Which makes almost a gentleman funny “Crip” Nat. Small “Crip” Nat is too heedless In judgments of life, And declares that a wife Is expensive and needless; A luxury meant for the titled and rich, Folks not bred in the gutter and born in a ditch; While, if most eggs are addled And doubtful is bliss, He declines to be saddled With bondage like this; And he thinks that, if liberty can't turn him fat, There is less hope in marriage—at least for “Crip” Nat. “CRAB” JEAN. Jean is leggy and lanky And cross-made and cranky, And never content; On her sorrowful face Sits the sourest grimace, And she's never unbent. O she looks as if dug out of earth and still dusty With darkness and stains And the mould that remains— Which no doubt makes her still more distempered and crusty; She can't help being mean, Just because she's “Crab” Jean. Jean is ruffled and rumpled And crookèd and crumpled, And whining all day; Fond of sitting alone With a stick or a stone, And not seen once to play. For her parents both gamble and guzzle like fishes— They throw chairs about And then keep her without, And when they have done eating she licks the bare dishes; So she is very lean, Wretched hungry “Crab” Jean. Jean is toppled and tumbled Around, and has stumbled Along through the years; Sorrow is her black bread, And there's grey on her head And her cup has been tears. Ah, she is all great eyes that look harried and haunted With watching and care, And their pitiful stare Turns away to dead walls as afraid to be taunted; And she never was clean, But she's only “Crab” Jean. Jean is dreary and draggles Her limbs, as she straggles Through darkness and strife; Peering out, with dim gaze, On the hubbub and haze Of inscrutable life. For she feels a blind creature that frets at its muzzle, And draws a long chain Of oppression and pain, And tries idly to break the still-deepening puzzle; O what angel will wean, From her troubles, “Crab” Jean? LIZ. Lazy Liz has a head that is fuzzy as fur And she looks like a kitten, If rubbed the right way she will certainly purr, But if not you'll be bitten. There she lies on the doorstep and basks in the sun, In her unadorned patches; And though free with scratches, I know they are mostly in innocent fun! There she lies in her plumpness, a picture to make For a mother to keep, Half-awake, Half-asleep. Lazy Liz is an animal more than a girl, And a thing to be cuddled And kissed and kept far from the racket and whirl, Wherein we must be huddled; She has no sense of time, and no talent for toil And exists for mere slumber, Like pure precious lumber, Curled up by herself in a beautiful coil. If you stroke her, those big eyes of drowsiest ken Will with something like pain Ope, and then Shut again. Lazy Liz only rouses to eat and to drink And grows visibly fatter, She cannot afford to lose even one wink On a less urgent matter; Sometimes a stray dog has been seen on her head And without her awaking, Of course from mistaking Her hair for a doormat conveniently spread; While the sparrows come down and alight on her neck And, completing her pose, Hop and peck At her nose. Lazy Liz has been known to sleep twice round the clock And then still to be sleepy, In spite of four fights and the constable's knock Which made other folks creepy; Her large-lidded eyes have the nebulous look As of far-away being And other-world seeing, When opening a moment their mystical book. And I fancy the “kitten” we pet is no clue, Though it's nicely put on, And the true Child is gone. LIL. Look at butterfly Lil, Never staid, never still, Here and there like a vision of lightning And fun, In the sun Or the shadow, yet equally bright'ning The beauties of each With her frolicsome reach! She is fairest of fair things and shamefully fickle, In love with herself and with any kind boy Who provides her a toy— With a tongue like a sickle. Look at butterfly Lil With her volatile will, Always glad of new choices and changes— Though sick; And the stick Even opens to her happy ranges! She welcomes a blow, Just because of the glow And the exquisite sense of relief that comes after; She's good grit and seasoned by weather and lack, And she takes the worst whack With the medicine of laughter. Look at butterfly Lil, In the heaviest ill With a snap of her bold grimy fingers At pain, Or the rain And the cold, or the worry that lingers! And, failing her food, No less merry her mood; Who's the worse for a trifle like losing a dinner, When mischief remains with its riches and store? So she troubles no more, And does not grow the thinner. Look at butterfly Lil, In the dolorous mill Of her lot, that looks fair but in fiction And song, Waxing strong And more bright with the blasts of affliction! To the backbone she's game, Ever pert and the same, Though a child with a hardness and wit beyond guessing; A doubtful companion—as in the wrong stall, And a torment to all But yet somebody's blessing. SISS. Saucy Siss is a sunbeam that breaks through a cloud, Which it softens in manifold ways When she plays; And her mother, the fat apple-woman, is proud Of the darling who brightens her days, Though she strays; If the direst misfortune Should ever importune Her presence or path, she would turn it to gold; There is no one like Siss For a game or a kiss, There is no one as bashful and no one as bold. Saucy Siss is arrayed in superior dress, In a garment of wonderful hue And light blue; From a hat that's all feathered and fluffy one tress Just lets out in soft yellow a clue, That is true; For the whole is good metal, Each bud and each petal, Each thorn that assures you she's healthy and strong; There is no one like Siss For a game or a kiss, There is no one more ready for sugar or song. Saucy Siss is the joy of her household, and all Her young playmates float down on the tide At her side; She is clothed with such splendour and stands up so tall, And her petticoat flutters out wide In its pride; She has jewels and spangles, And treasures she dangles About her, and then her deportment is grand; There is no one like Siss For a game or a kiss, There is no one whose look is like hers a command. Saucy Siss is the plague and the blessing of each Who is hers by affection or kin, And steps in To her web for the victims she knows she can reach With the wiles she is eager to spin As a gin; She seems evermore smiling And gay and beguiling, And coaxes out coins you determined to keep; There is no one like Siss For a game or a kiss, There is no one as regnant awake or asleep. LOO. Loo is daring and dusky, And speaks in a husky Low voice with a sinister scowl, And her hair Is like midnight, and she like a shadowy owl That delights in the gloom as a cloud in the air; She looks common and ugly In feature and face, But in bed sleeping snugly She assumes a new grace; I once paid her a visit, as often I do, And there found in her place a bright angel—not Loo. Loo is unwashed and haggard At morning, a laggard And grumbles to leave her poor couch; But at eve She flares up like the gas, and is ready to slouch On her mission of darkness to forage and thieve; With her heavy lips pouted, Her forehead all creast And her frock furred and clouted, She seems a wild beast; But in spite of her crossness she's easy to woo, Though not easy to win in her tantrums is Loo. Loo has marrow and muscle And shines in a tussle, Prepared for a blow or a scratch, And her fist For a child's has a vigour one hardly could match; Only try, and you'll see who is first to desist. She is often quite sober If penury calls, And as grave as October When the crimson leaf falls; If she washes her lips in beer sometimes, we too Are as erring without the excuses of Loo. Loo to me looks enchanted, A maiden transplanted From bowers where blossoms are gems And birds sing; And I still see, betwixt the bare winterly stems, All the promise and sweet resurrection of Spring; When her dark grey eye flashes, I think of the palm That shoots up from its ashes Renewed like a psalm; And if Christ were to traverse the slums, I know who Would be hid in His arms—it would be wicked Loo. PRUE. She has healthy round cheeks Like the blossom of apple, And freshness one seeks All in vain from Whitechapel; The tangles that tumble about her fair head Form a beautiful cluster, But might want a duster To make them the proper and perfect gold thread; And her eyes' merry blue, With their beaming And dreaming, Light up a sweet picture of childhood called Prue. She has pretty curved lips Full as rosy as coral, Though her fingers' brown tips Deal in mud for its moral; Her ears are like shells polished white by the waves Till they curl up and glisten, Which came out to listen And still keep the music in murmurous caves; But her tongue can be rue And its twitter Quite bitter, If neighbours presume to impose upon Prue. She has naked soiled feet That seem fresh in creation, As sprung from the street Like a new revelation; While her wonderful legs are all bonny and bare Nor asserted demurely, And carry securely The thoughts of a queen and a kingdom of care; And her general hue To each gusset Is russet, Reminding of earth—for an earth-child is Prue. She has garments of tags And the Whitechapel vesture, Half ribands, half rags, But a tyrannous gesture; With the ways of a woman and face of a child, And a laugh as delicious As softly seditious, And notions and words in a babblement wild; The infallible clue To her graces' Embraces Is peppermint, which is resistless for Prue. “STAR.” When the darkness is thickest And shadows come down, Or the pulses beat quickest And skies wear a frown; O her soft little hand falls as dew upon pain, With a flutter, And utter Relief to its chain; And the wound of the weary forgets its old scar, When she touches the stain— Little “Star,” Happy “Star.” Though her clothes are so spotted With weather and wear, And the burden allotted Is heavy to bear; Yet she always is cheery in want, and her eyes Have a glory And story Like news from the skies; And the prisoning care then relaxes its bar, When her love on it lies— Little “Star,” Happy “Star.” If her manners are simple Or rugged in deed, Still the red of her dimple Flames up at your need; She is ready to help you, in tune with that blush Like the clover, While over You breathing a hush; For her springs of compassion are not very far, And for misery gush— Little “Star,” Happy “Star.” Do not deem she is clever Or learnéd in books, Though the Gospel seems ever Writ large in her looks; Do not ask for proprieties or pretty dress And your lustre, But trust her— She will not transgress; She is faithful and fond, if some blemishes mar, You will have to confess— Little “Star,” Happy “Star.” “DOT.” Dumpy “Dot” Is the smallest Of dear girly things, A bright spot That feels tallest When trying her wings; And in thick London vapour, Where gaslights burn low And shops hardly show, She shines out like a taper— You could read any paper, By her fairy glow. Dumpy “Dot” Is the brightest Of children I see, Though her lot Is not lightest— She's brisk as a bee; And she gathers her honey From pavement and mire, In tattered attire Looking roguish and funny— She picks up her money And toys, at desire. Dumpy “Dot” Is the sweetest Of innocent loves, Though she's not The discreetest; Her voice is a dove's; And the chimes of her chatter Go straight to the heart With a tune more than art; And her feet have a patter, All troubles to scatter And comfort each smart. Dumpy “Dot” Is a pickle, Yet no one would fret If the pot In her fickle Career were upset; But her likes have a flavour Of commerce and greed, And her business-like creed Gives the true city savour; For she won't sell one favour, Till properly fee'd. “STUMPS.” Tiny toddling And waddling Unclassified “Stumps,” There is no one resembling that form, Like a storm In a tea cup, excepting perhaps her doll “Dumps;” Though past mistress of talking She's prentice at walking, Explorer of pavements and dust in the street, With a talent for tumbles Devoid of all grumbles, Which makes her though dirty surpassingly sweet. Pretty hustling And bustling Impertinent “Stumps” Goes careering full tilt with her tread Right ahead, And indifferent still to the cruelest bumps; What are warnings of mothers Or watchings of brothers, To babies of two who can never stop still? Like a steam-engine puffing, And heedless of cuffing And counsels, she follows her own wayward will. Ragged, restless And nestless, Adventuring “Stumps,” Better known far away from her kin Than within In the home where she finds less affection than thumps; In the miriest quarter, Like ducks in the water She paddles and rolls as none better can do, And returns from her study Deliciously muddy, Half-frockless, all fearless, with only one shoe. Rough and rambling And scrambling Ineffable “Stumps”— I often admire her at play On my way, Like a new dear wee monster just hatched with wild jumps; She is perfectly charming, Though somewhat alarming When tacked on to my coat tails and greedy of pence; But she looks brown and beautiful, Gaily undutiful, All naked nature, without one pretence. NAN. We all know little Nan, We all love little Nan— Yes, in spite of her begging and petulant dirt Which has claims on our notice it should not assert; For if tiny she's built on a womanly plan, Though she's often half-dressed and is wholly ungirt; And she's wilful and lazy With mischievous moods, And her notions are hazy Of other folk's goods; Yet I'd give her the pick of my treasures and chattels, To hear for five minutes how sweetly she prattles. We all know little Nan, We all love little Nan, Though she comes from Whitechapel and breaths of its air, And has boots much too big and impossible hair, And seems packed by mistake in too narrow a span, For she's bonny in rags and when naughty looks fair; And if pert she is pleasant And sweet as a kiss, While her laugh is a present That no one would miss; I am sure no two feet have as pretty a patter, And wish her dear cheeks would just grow a bit fatter. We all know little Nan, We all love little Nan, Though she never was properly washed since her birth, And would seem to fine ladies a thing of no worth, If compared with a pug or a Japanese fan; But to me she is precious and racy of earth; Though her conduct is shady As well as her skin, I'll bet your fine lady Sinks deeper in sin; And I'd greatly prefer a soiled face with affection, To cleanness which ends and begins in complexion. We all know little Nan, We all love little Nan, With her impudent tongue and her rollicking ways As she stumbles along in bad courses, and strays And regardless of rights gathers all that she can— But she has her good angel at times, when she prays; If she only had teaching, Example and love, She would soon be outreaching White wings of a dove To the sunlight and fly from her evil in terror; She took the wrong turning at first—just in error. TOD THE COSTER. I. Here's the king of all costers That Whitechapel fosters, Within its dark haven of mischief and muck; This he looks, this he knows, While his honest face glows As he trundles along his magnificent truck, With the freightage of fish Or the fruits that are ripe, And whatever you wish— Not forgetting his pipe; Any girl would feel fluttered or pleased with a nod— When he passed with his cargo of treasures—from Tod. He is cheeky and chatters, And sometimes he scatters A handful of nuts for the children about; Though we cannot deny, If the trade goes awry, He is quite as prepared and as free with a clout. In his waistcoat of red And a wonderful hat, With his confident tread He looks jolly and fat. Be it onions or apples, a herring or cod, You are sure of fair dealing and measure with Tod. He can tell a good story, And swears he's a Tory And sticks to his Church and believes in his Peer; He declares there's no fight In the Rads., who delight But in prating and rob the poor man of his beer. So he votes for the Swells, Not the swabbers of ink, Though when spinning his “spells” He's a devil to drink. But he's always well drest and respectably shod, And as sober as you till the evening is Tod. He is widely respected, And might be elected A “Member” he says, but can't yet lend a hand; Though if troubles should come, And he prophesies some, Then perhaps he might make it convenient to “stand.” And I'd rather have him With one notion held tight, Than the babblers who swim In confusion and night; For he'd never let us bear the foreigner's rod, And a patriot heart with his failings has Tod. “MISTER JOHN.” He was once a small tradesman who kept a small shop, And as good as his neighbours Or better for labours, But rather too fond at all times of a drop; So the liquor ran in And the money ran out, And although he grew stout Yet the business got thin; Till at length it took wings in a desperate hurry, And persons were kindly but still they moved on, For they now would not worry Their friend “Mister John.” Thus he went down the stream that was mainly of beer, But a little too present; And at first it seemed pleasant, But coffers waxed empty and then things looked queer. His companions, who helped To distribute his gold, Turned all distant and cold, And the dogs even yelped. In the end he went off with a dreadful misgiving, For people had gone And removed with his living, And left just “Mister John.” And he quickly sank deeper and still deeper down, Till he prized half an apple Or crust in Whitechapel, And heaven above was one horrible frown. His old customers too, If they happened to meet Him, crossed over the street And had business to do; While he found pity scarce, as he stood at the corner, Where gas dimly shone, And that too seemed a scorner Of poor “Mister John.” Any night you may see him not far from the door Of some garish beer tavern, Which he thinks a cavern Of gold and delight with a diamond floor. If he only can kill For a season his shame And the thought of the blame, He will drop lower still. But when sober at morning he'll think with a shiver (And newspapers con) Of one plunge in the river, To right “Mister John.” SNUDGE. Here's a feather for science, A laurel for lore, To keep green our reliance If drooping before; It is not a new fossil, no gas or a stench, Not a boom in a planet Or law that began it, Nor element wrung from its chemical clench. We have really discovered at length the lost link, In the Whitechapel sludge; Only think— It is Snudge! With his jaws too obtrusive, And deep-sunken eyes Darting glances elusive As dreading surprise; With his low furrowed forehead and criminal lip Dropping down the right corner, A mien like a mourner, And curses that fall like the crack of a whip; With his shaggy black eyebrows that bristle defence, To impose on the judge Some pretence— This is Snudge. Hardly man and more monkey And scurvied and scarr'd, With a furtive and funky Expression on guard; Mean and shrivelled and shrunk out of all human shape, As if dried in an oven— The dress of a sloven, A fidgety foot that seems bent to escape; With a heart that respires its own poisonous breath, And will harbour a grudge To the death— This is Snudge. Growing down and yet colder And grayer with time, With humped nature and shoulder Crutched easy for crime; With long arms and crookt fingers that open and snap On the throat or the plunder— The man, of course, under— And careless of blood, with a click like a trap; With a stertorous voice always wheezy, that thinks All morality fudge, As he drinks— This is Snudge. But among his foul vices And conduct's black blot, And the sin that suffices, There's one brighter spot; For inside the tenth part of the part of a house, Where he herds with the steepings Of jail and the sweepings, He finds room and sneaking regard for a mouse; And to this he devotes all his leisure and care Who for others won't budge, And won't spare— This is Snudge. BLACK BILL. He is rough, I allow—is Black Bill, And as tough As he's rough; But he drudges away with a will, Though he never gets victuals enough For himself but is satisfied still, For the wife Who's his life; Ah, he knows what are toiling and trouble And seems carried down stream like a bubble, While he suffers and works for her double, With the need at his breast like a knife. He is brave, you admit—is Black Bill, And as grave As he's brave, With more patience and powder than skill, And no tyrant could make him a slave; But, silk pet, it is worries that kill; Late and lone On the stone Of the street, with no food perhaps tasted, Stabbed by cold and by summer's heat basted, He is left day and night and seems wasted To a shadow, and worn to the bone. He is near, we confess—is Black Bill, And as dear As he's near; He's a diamond fashioned by ill, Somewhat rugged, with trial and tear, Ground to shape in sharp poverty's mill; By the thorn Of our scorn And our floutings so splendidly taken, To a hero of rock he is shaken, And the ordeals only awaken His true wealth, and his troubles adorn. He is shy, all perceive—is Black Bill, But as spry As he's shy, And determined at least his poor Jill, If he hungers and aches and goes dry, In his scrapings shall yet have her fill; For her sake He may break A few laws, for she is his one treasure, And of all his pursuits the one measure, While with sadness he meets toil and pleasure— Whether shovel or cockles and cake. TINY TIM. You would surely respect, Though not of the elect, One wee morsel turned out by the slums, With keen ear to detect At a distance the fifes and the drums, And quick foot to welcome their strums; He's a thoroughbred sample And a grimy example Of the stuff that the gutter can make, And the oven of trial hard-bake; You might feel some affection for him, Tiny Tim, Though they call him, alas, Satan's limb— Tiny Tim. He'd look pretty if clean, Which he never was seen; He's a Whitechapel baby, you know, But he does not act mean If less ready for words than a blow, And a lamb with a fleece not of snow; And if in for a scrimmage, He would leave you an image That your mother herself could not tell, And might empty your pockets as well; So just spare a small copper for him, Tiny Tim, For his landmarks of duty are dim— Tiny Tim. But he's not very small, As a fact not at all, Such an infant as Hercules might Have appeared and as tall, Who would tackle a Bobby at sight And emerge, too, the best from the fight; If he stood in his stocking— But it seems rather shocking, He was never in one nor a sheet— He would stand inches over six feet; It were well to be friendly with him, Tiny Tim, And not seem quite so proper and prim— Tiny Tim. He can cut carriage wheels On his head and his heels, Which is more than a bishop could do Who for him hardly feels, And indeed for that matter than you, Though you put all your powder in too; And while grubby he's gritty, And can chortle a ditty That would set honest hair on an end, Or a wig if to that you descend; And the decalogue was not for him, Tiny Tim, His commandments are hungry and grim— Tiny Tim. He is fashioned of fire And the pavement and mire, But he has his own honour as much As the rogues who aspire To the credit that carries a smutch, And then frame of religion a crutch; Though he is a pure savage Fain to riot and ravage, Yet he wears not a hypocrite's smirk, And would scorn his rough labour to shirk; There is nothing behind hand with him, Tiny Tim, Though your codes might find plenty to trim— Tiny Tim. He is true to his class, And not rude to a lass And he would not strike one for a crown; And to let a girl pass, Just for fear she might sully her gown, In the mud he would plump himself down; He is fond of the gutter, And coarse bread with no butter Seems a good enough meal for his plan, If he earns it at least like a man; For sheer hunger is sweet sauce to him, Tiny Tim, And your squeamishness only a whim— Tiny Tim. He has tricks—never mind— And is deaf, dumb, and blind, Or whatever is likely to pay, If he thinks you look kind And a bobby is not in the way— But have you never shammed, he might say? He will whimper and wobble And deplorably hobble, Should he scent in your figure a flat, With a pitiful story all pat; But perhaps you have brought it on him, Tiny Tim, That his hat is in holes with no brim, Tiny Tim. Let who may be your pet, Upon him I will bet For the staunchness he gets from his breed, And if famished or wet Or half perished, all human his creed— To be loyal to chums in their need; He is ripe for a rally, To help Tom or help Sally— And especially her, if she calls— Ah, I pity his foe, when he falls; He's a trump, and there's treasure in him, Tiny Tim; You have cream, and he scarcely the skim, Tiny Tim. If you happen to trip Through Whitechapel and slip, He is certain to give you a chance Of a generous tip; If you won't—well, beware of a dance, As he taught one poor Canon romance; But he has English leaven And may still squeeze in Heaven, When your Pharisee's canting and pride In the shadow will shiver outside; I suspect there's a corner for him, Tiny Tim, When the humbugs go down he will swim, Tiny Tim. TOUGH. Tough is careful And prayerful When danger looms out, And the man in the street may be wanted at last, With the bluecoats about And a shadowy past; Then he brushes his hat and attends to devotions, While torn in his breast by distracting emotions; He watches the door, And a traitorous thrill If a mouse only patters or squeaks on the floor Makes his heart for a moment with terror stand still. Tough in highways And byways Is certainly seen, But prefers the more quiet and sheltery spot Where the dimness may screen And observers are not; Then his head is set off at a different angle, He feels as a Briton his duty to wrangle And gossip and drink With his comrades, and those Who are ready at all indiscretions to wink And will not raise the devil they cannot compose. Tough has idling And sidling Approaches and ways, And he never goes straight if he can but go round; He is restless, and stays A brief time in one ground; If you seek him, don't dream he will keep for your orders The place he just trod or a mile from its borders; He leads, as I know, A strange vanishing life, And he studies the winds and the warnings that blow, While he plunders at large and with men is at strife. Tough is meagre And eager Of features and form, With a straw in his mouth which he mumbles for bread, While he never looks warm And he hardly seems fed; Like his own London fog he for ever is shifting, With no proper will and with circumstance drifting From trouble to grief, With no effort to stop, As an outcast and sworn irrepressible thief, To the gallows at last and the terrible Drop. SIM. Sim is silent and cunning of tread And a planner Of plots, with a manner Of turning his head Round behind him, as if the police on his track, As is usual, now were quite close at his back; He is furtive and foxy And hates orthodoxy And sunshine, and lives in the shade With his tools; For his trade Is a burglar's, and not taught in schools. Sim is sleek and well groomed for the slums, And when smiling Displays his beguiling White teeth to the gums; Like a dog with resilient lips, that intends Blood and murder, if weakness unheeding offends; He was first quite respectable With a delectable Birth as a butler, till fate Turned his tune, And one June He made off with the jewels and plate. Sim is surly at seasons, if grist Or the plunder Runs short from a blunder, And free with his fist; But he's never himself without something on hand, Like a job in the country judiciously plann'd; Ah, with danger he rises, He dreads no surprises; He's greatest when “cracking up cribs” Or a life, With his knife In some troublesome gentleman's ribs. Sim has one tender spot for his boy Whom he hives for In darkness, and strives for With perilous joy; And the child whom he shields, growing fairer with time, Never dreams his rich blessings are purchased with crime; While the father keeps toiling At evil, and soiling His soul for the beautiful child; While he spins, Out of sins, All the garments so dear and defil'd. GEORGE. There is no one exactly like versatile George For a fight or a feast— And he minds not the least Which—if he may be free with his knuckles or gorge; For a meal or a maul, He is ready with all; And the lasses Who scream “Hallelujah,” and strum On the drum, And the tambourine, share with his glasses The honour to warm His big muscular form. George is handy and lives like the rest by his wits, Now he swaggers as groom And carries a broom, Or imposes on dupes with deplorable fits; In the sunshine and shade, He is busy with trade; And sells matches To youngsters who study their pipes, But want stripes; And his clothes are uncleaness and patches; But dig through the dirt, You may come to a shirt. George has only one eye which is better than two, And the bridge of his nose Has a bashful repose— The result of a conflict his folly would woo; Though this always will pay Pretty well in the day, With the fiction, Worked up with appropriate tears And dark fears, And served hot as a dreadful affliction; For each artful gash, Is worth something in cash. O a long-headed man and sharp dealer is George, With his mercantile eye When to sell or to buy, And a hand as the hammer that strikes at the forge, Moving true with its chime To the purpose and time, If in tatters; And though none is quicker than he For a spree, When he gives like a monarch he scatters; He's a master in guile, But not utterly vile. MOSES THE JEW. This is Moses the Jew, And his comrades are few Though his dollars are many and safely invested, And he has his own house But is warmly detested, For he leaves not behind him a scrap for a mouse; While he wears funny clothes And expresses odd oaths, And goes prying about from dust-bin to dung-heap With the longest of noses, And gathers all cheap; For a sharp eye to picking has miserly Moses. This is Moses the Jew, Whom his Miriam knew While she lived as his wife as the meanest of masters; For a fresh frock to him Was the chief of disasters, And the milk that she purchased was bound to be skim; Yes, a bonnet a year He considered too dear, And a ribbon he thought was a terrible sin; He was dead against roses, And counted each pin; Ah, a cheese-paring would not be wasted with Moses. This is Moses the Jew, And a singular view He presents to the Gentiles to whom he's a stranger; And he scents a good job As the ox does the manger, But whatever his bargains he whines that they rob, And procure him no gain Beyond losses and pain; And a dozen old hats on the top of his head Give the queerest of poses, He turns stones into bread, But none ever saw sign of contentment in Moses. This is Moses the Jew, With his garments askew And his beard at an awful preposterous angle; For a farthing less cost He will higgle and wrangle, And (if winner) vow all his labour is lost; But he softens his tone Not for lucre alone, But for widows and orphans to whom he expands And affection discloses, As scripture commands; Though to every one else he is skinflint old Moses. “THE CORPSE” (JOE). Here's an ugly phenomenon, friends, And “The Corpse” is his singular name, For he gains all his money and ends By his ghastly cadaverous frame; Sepulchral his face and his tones And his front like a death's head is cast, And he lives simply just in his bones Like a wreck of the primitive past; He looks dug like a fossil from graves, While each breath is a battle And his limbs seem to rattle Like the fetters that clank upon slaves. In the dingiest nooks he is found With the eyes deeply sunk in the skull, As if strayed from some burial ground With his gaze all so vacant and dull. He is lean as the demon of dearth, Through his ribs seems to whistle the gust, He appears to arise from the earth With a crumbling of clods and the dust. Though he feasts by defying the laws Yet he never grows fatter, And his yellow teeth chatter In his bloodless and terrible jaws. For he cultivates pallor and knows How to trade on his thinness and baulk The most sceptical eye, till he shows A dead body with lamp-black and chalk. In the heat of the summer he shakes And he shivers with merciless cold, As he mumbles his falsehoods and makes A grim horror—as fresh from the mould. If unwatched, as he thinks, his gaunt cheek Which he pinches and taxes Into laughter relaxes, When he pictures the pothouse to seek. He is faithful, wan Joe, to his views Of a living and honest and hard, And the bye-ways of thieving eschews While he plays his one skeleton card. At the corners he lurks on the prowl For the dupe of the innocent face, With mortality writ on his jowl And the print of the earth-worm's embrace. He's consumptive, rheumatic, and queer With suspicion of cancer, And all ailments that answer And at last are converted to beer. “SILLY” SOL. “Silly” Sol is half-witted And wholly distrest, If he would be acquitted Of evils confest; But as bright as a button, A regular glutton For mischief when chances occur for a spree; Then the foolish expression is nowhere to see, And he tucks up his trousers and hitches his belt In a business-like way— When some profit is smelt; And his language is such as allows no delay. “Silly” Sol is an actor Who plays for his bread, But his skull is compacter Than many a head; And his hand is as nimble As your dainty thimble, Dear Una, when trimming the frock for the ball And the stitches fly fast and the clock strikes the call; Though his face may look vacant, he knows the right side Of the edge for his gain, Where the good things abide; And, unless for a copper, he does not complain. “Silly” Sol has some habits We can't think correct, Keen as dogs after rabbits When dupes least expect; Then he makes all the running, With marvellous cunning, Which an idiot not of the slums could not show When the weather is right and the proper winds blow; His deficiences cover his sins as church vaults, And the bobbies about Are not hard on his faults; Though there's daylight within, if it's darkness without. “Silly” Sol takes the measure Of neighbours and all And he knows where is treasure In stocking or stall, And the cracked pot with fillings Of halfpence and shillings; For a simpleton really he's clever and smart, And if only half baked there is jam in the tart; For he's mad upon pussies, and makes them his cares; And it is not a myth, That he puzzled the smith With his “horse” shoe which Sol fancied might be a “mare's.” “GENTLEMAN” FRANK. I must now introduce you to “Gentleman” Frank With his gaiters, Though he was once equal to rank In extraction and place, my young lord, with your pater's; He has grimly come down From the cake of the Classes, To wallow and drown In the mud of the Masses; For he erst knew refinement and lay in the lap Of life second to none, If he now lies foredone And the prey of that Moloch the terrible Tap. I have infinite pity for “Gentleman” Frank And his troubles, Though ages have passed since he sank To this beggarly lot which remorse only doubles; He is son of a Peer And was cradled in satin, And when maudlin with beer He will hiccough in Latin; In his crapulous talk though his glory has set, In his stertorous haste With his arm round a waist, He is not like the others—he cannot forget. His companions at heart respect “Gentleman” Frank And his tumble, Though he has himself but to thank That he sticks to the street and his station is humble; He had fortune and health And the best of all chances, But threw away wealth And a life like romances; He kept sinking and sinking as if he must drown, If arising with pain Just to sink once again; But it's over at last for his lot—he keeps down. He's a gentleman still this poor “Gentleman” Frank In the gutter, If future days to him are blank And his past is a blot and his bread has no butter; For he carries with him His nobility's patent, And though it be dim It is never quite latent; That indelible stamp of the breeding and birth Never dies out in man, And the delicate plan Can't be smothered in drink and the dregs of the earth. “THE SHADOW” (SHADRACH). Like a mist on a meadow Is old Shadrach the “Shadow,” With his presence that darkens the street; As he passes, the lamp Takes the sinister stamp Of the gloom of his funeral feet; Never sunbeam will play On his menacing way, Never child knows the clasp of his hand; For a horror umbrageous That is cold and contagious Scatters round him a blight on the land. His the blood of the gipsies, And he carries eclipses On his ravening path as he goes; For the beautiful beam And the happiest dream, When he comes, turn to wanness and woes. Not a sound do you hear, Till as sudden as fear He is felt but unseen at your side, In his terrible dimness And that ominous grimness, Like a shark on a death-bearing tide. As a bloodhound will follow Over hill, under hollow, So he tracks you with pitiless pace, By some instinct like scent With unswerving intent, Though you never may once see his face— Like the ghost of a knave, And as still as the grave; Till, as time with your journey moves on, You (who toil for his living), With a sickly misgiving Wake to find all your treasures are gone. He seems only the etching Or outlines of a sketching That might possibly grow to a man, If the Maker filled in What he chose to begin And was not quite ashamed of his plan. But the “Shadow” is not Without one kindly spot, And it's not all a bramble the stem; For, if hardly he harrows Men, he loves London sparrows, And shares often his dinner with them. THE “WORM” (SAUL). Long and lanky Is clever and keen-witted Saul, And his Sankey Seems ever so glib at his call; He can sing, He does ring All the changes on hymns and the songs That are food to his Whitechapel throngs, To the airs which they borrow from tavern and stage, When with pious contortions he chooses to squirm With one page from the boards—from the pulpit one stage, Like a worm. Even Ethel, The pride of the coster and flower Of smug Bethel, Admits he has wonderful power; He will raise With his praise Such a tempest of soul-searching sound, That the Devil himself is quite drown'd. Saul improves the occasion, while warning the hearts, Just to empty the pockets of friends who are next, While he wriggles with unction and sticks to his arts And his text. Like a lion He roars at the folly and sin, And in Sion His voice thunders bolts against gin; He can preach, He does teach The most beautiful sentiments pat, And then weeping goes round with his hat; O he writhes, O he wrestles in prayer with vice For the weal of the flock he religiously shears, And surrenders his all while his dupes pay the price Of his tears. At revivals His twistings and turns are the best, New arrivals By such are most deeply imprest; All in black, With no lack Of good principles and a smart phrase, He can make the fresh tinder soon blaze. Neatly shaven, long-jawed and close-cropt, with his showers Of repentance he looks a church rock and as firm; But, if false to the core yet he doats upon flowers, Though the “Worm.” THE BULLY (BOB). Bully Bob Likes a job For his biceps and muscle, He makes light Of the bloodiest tumble and tussle, And can fight; Heavy-jowled and high-cheekboned and bearded and black, Never washed, never sober, he treads but one track And allows but one cheer In the pothouse and beer; He thinks, in for a penny is in for a pound; If the reason is false, that alone is his ground. Bully Bob Hates a snob, And he straight gives him pepper Left and right, For he loathes a mere humbug high-stepper— He can fight; With square shoulders, deep chest and his ponderous arms And a truculent look, he distinctly alarms Any casual friend Who opposes his end; He says, hammer and tongs are far better than play; That's a funny opinion, but then it's his way. Bully Bob Does not rob With the usual sneaking, He has might And knows nothing is lost by plain speaking, And can fight; So he does not go sidling with serpentine stealth, But demands and quite boldly to drink your good health; And he will not abuse One who likes to refuse A frank offer, nor act as a commoner clown; He will take what he wants, having first knocked you down. Bully Bob Loves a mob, For displaying his science; He is right, As he feels in his hands such reliance And can fight; But for cripples he often exhibits the strength Of his arms, and wrong doers who measure their length Do not need hitting twice, As they find once suffice; He is the champion of cripples, with all his fierce air, And you may not admire him—but that's your affair. THE BUTCHER (BEN). Butcher Ben is a killer Of dogs and of cats, And a hardened fulfiller Of death to all rats; With a mongrel behind and a pipe in his lips And a hand that holds fast on the sharpest of whips, He strolls blear-eyed and blinking And slouching and slinking With the shiftiest glance and irresolute tread, And a moleskin cap stuck on the back of his head; As if he can't determine, If you are not vermin. Butcher Ben loves the slaughter Of innocent beasts, Though he has one dear daughter He fondles and feasts; And if red from the torture of helpless dumb things, He'd not ruffle her hair nor her white apron strings; But he goes shy and shambling On murderous rambling, From one court to another in quest of the food And the sport that is bliss to his barbarous mood; He is cunning and cruel, And to him pain is gruel. Butcher Ben has indwelling An infinite lust Of destruction, rebelling At kindness and trust; He thinks mercy is weakness and gentleness fear, And to him any sight that looks dreadful is dear; And his wife undetected Was soon vivisected, Though devotion to him was her singular fault, With the scalpel of savage abuse and assault; While his dog won the petting, She had the forgetting. Butcher Ben has a fashion We do not admire, For mere blood wakes a passion In him none desire; And the tiger in all at the bottom seethes up In his nature, as dregs from an unwashen cup; Though he scuttles and scrambles To all the near shambles, Yet he keeps a warm corner deep in his cold heart For the daughter he spoils with a princess's part; “Rover” first must be reckon'd, But she is a good second. THE “DEMON” (DAN). Though they call him the “Demon” he's mildest of men, With a dash Of politeness that sets off the wen Of the gutter spread out like a horrible splash From his head to his heel, On his watch-chain of steel; And his eyes are the softest cerulean blue That betray not a clue Of his grimy possessions Though he lives under decent society's ban Among grievous transgressions— Yet he's “Demon” Dan. But this is the quintessence of Whitechapel wit And the slums, To affix a wrong name that will sit Like false beacons, and style clever fingers all thumbs; For the “Demon” is mild As an innocent child, And peeps forth from his gloom and in wondering love, As the azure above From the clouds in their courses; Just as if a strayed infant, with never a plan, Gazed out on hell forces— Yet he's “Demon” Dan. How he reached that Inferno I truly can't guess— It is odd; For beneath his dark Whitechapel dress, There's a heart that believes in a heaven and God— There's the quivering spire Of an upmounting fire— There's the beating of wings of an infinite trust, In a desert of dust; Though he knows not a letter And subsides with strange pals in a prisoning span And goes clanking a fetter— He's not “Demon” Dan. And he is fully as honest as you with his toil, I can vow; For that dim disrespectable soil Has no home in his breast, if it shadows his brow; For the shavings off spars And the ends of cigars, With the tags and the rags and the refuse of bones He collects from the stones; Though he shuns soap and water And once heaved half a brick at mad “Hallelu” Ann, While he keeps the rogue's quarter— He's not “Demon” Dan. “SUDDEN DEATH” SAM. “Sudden Death” is a horrible sham With his bulldog a brindle, Though his proper name really is Sam— He's a regular swindle; For his conduct is certainly queer, And his diet tobacco and beer With a casual herring; He has each heavy fault of his class, And sometimes is hitched on to an ass— Like himself sadly erring. Imposition for him is his breath, And most oddly he lives by his death. He would gammon the very elect— Even you, neighbour, and I Might be cheated by him, I suspect, And his mode operandi; It does give me a positive pain To reveal it, but let me explain— It's as plain as a pimple; He observes with a curious glance All the wayfarers yielding a chance, Looking out for the simple; When one passes to suit his desire, He proceeds at his ease to expire. For he has a fair portion of wits And at acting is clever, And no humbug can beat him at fits— Though a few may endeavour; In a moment, to some one's distress, He goes off like a railway express On his back foaming, kicking, And subsides with a gurgle and gasp, Should he fancy your purse will unclasp At his masterly tricking; If he hears then the magical sound Of a coin, he as quickly comes round. 'Tis a shocking performance to do You may cry, my dear madam; He's a hypocrite, but what are you With that cunning old Adam? He is kind to his bulldog and ass, Though he likes (as your husband) his glass, But betrays none with kisses; He deceives, just because it s his trade, And prefers (as you often) the shade— What of your stolen blisses? Imposition to him is his bread, And he only lives when he is dead. “SATAN” HARRY. “Satan” strolls gaily drest in the Whitechapel style And wears gloves and a flower and elegant smile, With his oily insidious manner, And red neck-kerchief fragrant of grease and of guile That goes flaming before like a banner. He is soapy and sly With a glass in his eye, Weaving webs for the fly As a spider that's spinning its thread, Always eager to marry And devour the poor bride for the dead— But his true name is Harry. Honey-wiled, with cheap jewels and sugar-plum bait, Steeped in fraud to his finger tips well he can wait Till the victim is charmed, if he chooses, While the net of entanglements closes in strait With the chance which the petulant loses; He is affable, smart In the devil's best part, And despises all heart; And he lives (as his lord) many lives A wild rake and a rover, And has wedded (they say) twenty wives And still sighs for fresh clover. He is craftily cruel and cloyingly sweet On the quest for stray maidens he watches to meet, But is carefully damnably sober, Wide awake for his prey till she falls at his feet As the withered leaves fall in October; He is ready of speech, And can beg or beseech With new stories for each, And besmears them before he eats up With his slimy addresses, Though with venom dropt in the gold cup, Like a serpent's caresses. While so heartless he still has a weakness for “kids,” Though his hands grip their spoil like the closed coffin lids, And in tender directions are chary, But to Mary and Jack (if no pleasure forbids) He is kind and loves both—but most Mary; He gives children his pence, And for all his defence Is no idle pretence; And for them he forsakes his foul trail Just to fetch and to carry, He will buy pretty toys if they ail— Yet they call him “Old Harry.” PODGE. Here is all alone Podge With his singular habits And face like a rabbit's, Determined to dodge Every creature that comes in his singular way— How he lives, where he sojourns, no person can say; And it does not much matter To you or to me, Only neighbours will chatter And no two agree; But he makes no companions, and still as a stone Through the day and at night he endures all alone— All alone, All alone. Podge abides in a mist, He is careful of clothing And seems to have nothing To do but exist; He is very particular too with his breath, Never speaks to a soul, and goes silent as death Up and down court and alley Seeking what he can't find; Even Sue and gay Sally Are not to his mind; He's been seen to pick quarrels with dogs for a bone, But he did it believing he was all alone— All alone, All alone. Podge is never too slow, And the sternest disaster Will not drive him faster, If hurricanes blow; At the same even pace on the same dreary round, Wet or dry, hot or cold, he seems fatally bound; And the same dull expression Appears on his face, But it yields no confession The wisest can trace; If he talked it would be with the same level tone, In the presence of hell, for he lives all alone— All alone, All alone. Do not reckon poor Podge Will explain if he passes For beer in full glasses, Where he loves to lodge; No policeman can help you, and no one has seen Him asleep or half tipsy when others have been; He allows not a pleasure Nor symptom of pain— Not a moment of leisure, Nor does he complain; In a world by himself, no geography's zone, Deaf and dumb, blind and dead, he resides all alone— All alone, All alone. BREEZY BESS. If things ever arrive at a stress Or a tangle, I'll lay all my money on Bess, Not to dangle— To dangle; For while others are dreaming and dawdling about At the lucky gold portals Once opened to mortals, In a trice she's within, while they dally without; For she tells the right moment When it's yes and not no meant, As her breezy young form in its bliss Blows a kiss— Blows a kiss. If you speak of a matter like dress Or a bonnet, There is no one like practical Bess Dead upon it— Upon it; If you're dealing with feathers or ribands or some Such mysterious question, I'll back her suggestion Against all, though the wisest of milliners come; If you go into flounces Or trimmings, she pounces Just on the solution desired, As inspired— As inspired. If you drop by mistake in a mess Or a scandal, There is no one as nimble as Bess With her candle— Her candle, To give light and relief at the one proper time; If you fall in a puddle Or other folks' muddle, At a simple extraction she's downright sublime; She's a kitten—who catches Her, knows what are scratches, But she purrs quite as sweetly when teased As when pleased— As when pleased. If you treat her (it's needless to press) To the candy She loves, not ungrateful is Bess And so handy— So handy; If consulting her tastes you propose her the choice She is partial to coffee, And reckons that toffee Is wholesome and excellent food for the voice. She has thoughts about marriage And driving a carriage, When her coster endows the bright lass With his ass— With his ass. “DOLL.” O we all are enamoured of dear little “Doll” With her merry blue eyes and long lashes, And flashes Of humour, if sometimes she screams like poor Poll, And is fond of a babel And upsets a table Or temper, and does not think twice— But she's nice; Though you never saw tantrums like hers out of fable And not without vice; She is always unstable, But then she's a woman and never was ice. Tiny “Doll” will go souse into any mad mess, For she lives in a racket and flutter And utter Contempt of such trifles as customs and dress; And her course is not humble Like sinners, who stumble And bother with penitent pains; And her stains Come more kindly to her, from too many a tumble In pestilent drains, At which good people grumble And leave—till the next dirty scandal complains. Daring “Doll” is a brick in the moment of need, She is Irish and fond of a shindy And windy Herself, in her ways and her Donnibrooke creed; In the stormiest weather, And light as a feather She flies when the stones are about— She steps out, And her tongue does away with propriety's tether; She despises a clout Of rude stick or rough leather, Like a petrel she rides on the hubbub and rout. Tricksy “Doll” is a darling, a great human love On her pale pretty cheeks paints its flushes And rushes To eye and red lip, aud enwraps like a glove— Yes, as warmly and tightly, Whether wrongly or rightly, When you once touch her sensitive part— She has heart; And that love in her sordid career burns more brightly Than candles of art, Like a star that beams nightly On litter and leavings of mud and of mart. PRETTY PRISS. Pretty Priss, pretty Priss Takes a coin or a kiss Like a lady and thanks you as well, She is good for a fight, She is good for a night And would dance like an angel to hell. She may have naughty ends, But she never pretends To be better than others or worse; She will give you fair play Or the time of the day, If desired, and wont stick at a curse. Pretty Priss, pretty Priss Deems a music-hall bliss, And for such her spare coppers she hoards; In her ribbons and tags And unspeakable rags, She would like to perform on the boards. Though she stumbles and strays, Still when sober she prays, With devotion becoming to her; And the God who's our kin Deeper looks than the skin, And finds pardon for pussies who err. Pretty Priss, pretty Priss, Takes no weather amiss, And all burdens upon her sit light; Be it famine or frost, Yet she counts not the cost, And is certain the end will come right. They may praise her or scold, Give a shilling or gold, Or presume on their riches to strike; For the pleasure or pain She is ready again, And receives every windfall alike. Pretty Priss, pretty Priss, Do not reckon on this— That your spirits will never run down, And your beauty won't fade In the gaslight and shade, If you now are so bonny and brown. But I feel very sure, No misfortune will cure You of follies like those of the past; That your life will be short, Kisses, ribbons and sport, You'll be pretty and bold to the last. QUEEN “BABY.” My dear duchess, it may be You have not seen “Baby,” The beauty who reigns in the slums; Though her hair is her crown, And all tattered her gown, And she still goes on sucking her thumbs. She is tidy and trim for a Whitechapel child, And her tangles at least are her own; She has stains on her hands, but are you not defil'd, If the rottenness yet is not known? From the garbage of gutter life bursts no white blossom, Though her blemish lies most on the face; What is soil on the body to soil in the bosom, Covered over with jewels and lace? Keep your feathers, fine gaby, But I prefer “Baby,” With all her rough manners and rags; She has temper no doubt, And it often flames out, But in sympathy she never lags. O she swears like a trooper, I cannot deny, And her speech is not drawing-room slang; But the danger you scuttle from she would defy And say straight to the devil, go hang. But yet somehow the oaths on those ripe lips of cherry Have a kind of propriety tone, As the thorns that protect the wild red winter berry As it shivers, cold, naked, alone. And if rod to belay be In pickle for “Baby,” She stands undefended, unarmed, Save by shrewd native wit And a tongue that can hit, With a heart that is never alarmed. For the gold is not all on that tumbled fair thatch Streaming over the earnest gray eyes, Hardly hiding the scar of the eloquent scratch, And deep down in her nature it lies. Do not ask me too closely the source of her living, Remember her home is the slums, She is true to her light, she is frank and forgiving In that air that befogs and benumbs. Truths as simple as A B Are unknown to “Baby,” Yet she wants no crutches or nurse, And secure as a Guelf Governs all but herself, Without laws or police or a purse. Ready tact, the right word, an invincible will, And a knowledge of neighbours' weak points, Give a power and throne that no monarch could fill Whom a grand coronation anoints. For her spirit admits of no rival, and truckles To no force—from no tyranny swerves, While at times and indeed she can use her brown knuckles In a fashion to scare timid nerves. BIG BELL. They are rather afraid of Big Bell And her bouncing, Though the reason is simple and easy to tell— She has given to many a bully a trouncing; And she lays it on thick With a broomstick or brick, Or whatever comes handy— See her last victim, “Sandy!” She is fond of the glass and a jolly good fling In the Whitechapel gutter, With her hiccough and stutter— That voluminous wench, that voluptuous Thing! She is blowsy of features—Big Bell. They look scarlet When she lurches along like a ship in a swell, Bearing down and full sail on some cowardly varlet, With her lolloping tread That would waken the dead, From the garish gas hot-house Of the gin-reeking pot-house; Ah, I pity the craven who crosses her then, On the road or her doorsill; He is just a mere morsel, For that ogress who mocks at a dozen such men. Never bonnet was worn by Big Bell, She despises Your tame fashions, and rolls on unhatted to hell, In her own rough-and-tumble undress that surprises; Her great shoes do not pair, And around her black hair With its natural glossing And tempestuous tossing She has sometimes been known to disport a red shawl; And indeed her bare bosom Often flares a flame blossom, Unconcealed, and would shock Mistress Grundy and all. But a tender heart still has Big Bell, And she gathers In its compass lost dogs and stray cats, and as well Every child she finds crying she mothers and fathers; For the dirtiest brat With its head like a mat, She would spend and quite willing, Her last loaf or last shilling. But whenever she tramps on the warpath of drink Glooming darker than Hindoos, Neighbours shut up their windows While they fasten their doors and away from her slink. LUCE. Jolly Luce, better known as the mother of Siss, Is delightfully human, The big apple-woman Whose fruit in the season you hardly could miss; She has many a basket And one roomy stall, Though her figure may mask it If ever you call. Her umbrageous proportions are landmarks to see And to fashion your course, Or a friendly resource— But, when signals mark danger, a foreland to flee. There's a husband about, a promoter of fears And rude temper and tattle, With bloodshed and battle, Who seems always “wanted ”and seldom appears. He has troublesome yearnings For oysters and stout, And is dead on her earnings When Law lets him out. But big Luce has a method and arm of her own And is awkward to face, Like a bear's rough embrace, Till the devil is laid and the tempest is blown. O big Luce has a spirit as large as her frame And a proper affection, With kind recollection Of others if down on their luck or in shame. Are you short of a shilling, Or faint for a feed? She is never unwilling, To lend what you need. If a neighbour is sick or a child seeks a rest, She is foremost of all And at ev'ry one's call, And would gather the world on her infinite breast. But the “apple” (she says) “of her eye” is bright Siss— Yes, for her she keeps scraping And screwing, and shaping Her efforts, that she may have plenty and bliss. So big Luce goes on trudging From morning to night, And except in her drudging Scarce finds a delight. And the seasons go out and the seasons come in With their changes and chimes, And are just working times Only ending again the same round to begin. “BUB.” She is lissom and sprightly And eager for chat, While she hops about lightly And never grows fat; She's the age of most people, but has not a name That a parent would hit On or parson deem fit, Yet it was not her choosing and she's not to blame; As a butterfly often springs out of a grub, So she flashes about in the gaudiest dresses With scintillant tresses, Though nicknamed mere “Bub.” In all winds and all weathers She fancies a fling, And you see her fine feathers In every good thing; At a feast or a funeral, quarrel or spree, In the daytime or night She takes equal delight, And with each as it comes is prepared to agree; She can carry her bottle and bear a rough rub With the stoutest, and likes at your cost to get mellow, Though her hair is yellow And she is plain “Bub.” But she's dismal when sober And haunted with fears, And then looks like October In red leaves and tears; But a pull at the poison will soon set her up From her querulous heap, And the laughters will leap Once again as she flies to the kiss or the cup; Then her mirth is too noisy for neighbours to snub, And she reads with an infinite zest the dark riddle Of life to the fiddle, Dear bibulous “Bub.” She is leggy and limber And fond of a dance, As if cork were her timber And days all romance; But she keeps a warm corner at heart for the Jews With their noses and bags And researches in rags, And for one half a week she held temperate views; Yes, for him like the cynic she lived in a tub, Till at least in an hour of presumptuous boasting She thought just of toasting Her goodness—poor “Bub.” “OLE GRAN.” This is funny “Ole Gran,' A quaint Whitechapel figure Composed on a plan Of old rags and all rigour; And mouldy with weather and lichened bytime To a singular shape, And half woman, half ape, With suspicions of moss and a coating of grime; She is threadbare and thrifty, And numbers twice fifty Long years and can still pick her oakum and thieve— So they say, and I think I can almost believe. Here's a health to “Ole Gran,” And a fig for aspersions! She gets what she can, And will have her diversions. If she holds the meum and teum are one, And the busy who toil Are preserved for her spoil, She does only what titled defrauders have done; And society brought her To this, and mistaught her— It pushed her along this deplorable way; And yet now we would grumble, at what we must pay. I wont bother “Ole Gran” With proprieties' wishes, If into her pan She pops my loaves and fishes; She is welcome to take of my margin and live On my leavings and pence, And to break through the fence Of my sound legal rights—and I freely forgive; Her dim doddering paces And crusty grimaces, Appeal to my love more than satin and silk, And if I enjoy cream, she may have the skim milk. Others threaten “Ole Gran” With policemen and such, And your drawing-room man Would recoil from her touch; Prigs allege she's unpleasant to nose and to eye; And is evil in look, Yet she fills up a nook In my heart, and the bearings of earth and the sky; As the blight on a meadow, She fits in the shadow Of life, and has somewhere her own proper place, Which is part of one whole, and as needful as grace. “AUNTIE.” Little hunchy-backed “Auntie,” incongruous elf, Has had never a foe in the world but herself, And the terrible drink With its adamant link; See, she stands not four feet in her highest-heeled boots By some very long inches, And bad habit pinches Her smaller, and stops any chance of new shoots Or a healthier growing; For all the fresh life, That would feed her, goes flowing In liquor and strife. But yet “Auntie” is wiser than all the wise men, And she carries a bottle of ink and a pen And can scribble (when paid) For a man or a maid The most marvellous letters of love without flaw; O her hand seems to caper And flourish on paper, Till ignorant people regard her with awe; And her moderate charges Surprise, though a verse Or two added enlarges Her claims on your purse. Wretched wee wrinkled “Auntie” is shaped like a bird With its plumage all ruffled and temper all stirr'd, With a long hooky beak, And looks washy and weak; While her spirit and body refuse to be friends, For the one is too active And one too contractive, And each goes about the most opposite ends; So I think her big nature Is in the wrong house, That would suit with its stature A midge or a mouse. Dowdy draggle-tailed “Auntie” has one funny craze, An aversion for children—she shrinks from their gaze, And would fly any street To escape their young feet; For when first to Whitechapel she drifted, I know, With her withered and stunted Poor frame, she was hunted By urchins with mud and with many a blow. And those terors yet tarry Within her scared eyes, And their brand she will carry To death's dark Assize. MOTHER MOG. Mother Mog has a kindly Compassionate brow, If she moves about blindly With suffering now; Though she never was married, Her children are scores, On her broad bosom carried— And babes she adores. Ah, the young and uncared for and helpless for miles, Ev'ry cat, ev'ry dog, Know the light of the blessing and warmth of the smiles Of the good Mother Mog. Mother Mog was thrown early Adrift on the street, In the fierce hurly-burly And fever of feet; But the sin and the sorrow Oped fountains of love In her heart, and a morrow Of mercy above. She possessed not one gift but a beautiful soul, And that pestilent Bog Which had sucked down whole worlds in its slimy control Could not snare Mother Mog. Mother Mog has the pureness Which comes from the heart, And that gives her secureness When iron bolts part; For her innocent pity Looks out on the pall Of that terrible City, And suffers for all. But still nothing can stay her or stumble her path, Neither lion nor log; And she walks yet unsinged in the furnace of wrath— Simple sweet Mother Mog. Mother Mog has no learning, To teach her the truth, But her mind feels the yearning Of infinite youth; And though more than twice thirty Her nature is green, And if awkward and dirty She moves like a Queen. She's a copy of Christ, and would die for the sin, That we flatter or flog; And I here raise my hat to the angel, within The poor plain Mother Mog. FAN. Frisky Fan Has a wonderful eye for a man, And for brothers; It's odd how they multiply fast, And the dearest of course is the freshest and last; Unlike others, She's never content with one string And would take all the sex cuddled under her wing, She is fair and fifteen although fifty in vice And in folly, A born flirt to tempt and entice And alone has been seen to flirt hard with a “dolly.” Naughty Fan Has fled long from Society's ban, Though still tender Of age, and is seasoned in sin From example and gentlemen's treating and gin— You can't mend her; Her manners are shocking, and tracts Only send her off swearing to uglier acts. Still her face keeps its infantine look, though her heart Is as blighted As harridans' hawked on the mart— To the devil for years she has truly been plighted. Dressy Fan Thinks costume is the only good plan, For young ladies; She'd sell her own soul with delight For a pretty pink frock, if she supped the same night Down in Hades; She'd worry a hat from a Jew, And no second hand slop but smart-ribboned and new. Yes, her taste is not bad, and your elegant dames With their varnish Who call her the vilest of names, Yet look vulgar to her with so little to garnish. Easy Fan Never troubled, since once she began, About morals; To her they are not for the poor, And seem just like the paint on a nobleman's door, Or the corals That hang around duchesses' throats, Who know nothing (in public) of rakes and wild oats. But then she with her weakness would not hurt a fly, Nor give sections Of life to each claim, all awry; She is perfect at least in her mere imperfections. OUR SAL. She is little but talking and tatters And oaths, In her clothes That for her are too big and strange matters, And tied up with string Just to keep out the weather, Though scarcely they cling In their fragments together; Ah, a funny old gal But at bottom a brick Is our Sal, If she seems such a cussed queer stick. Through the courts of the Gentiles and Jewry She tears, When she swears And breaks out in her petticoat fury; She's grayhaired and grim, Draggle-tailed and a Tartar— God have mercy on him She selected as a martyr! But, if wanted a pal In a moment of need, Try our Sal Whom I warrant a stunner indeed. You may sometimes see her at a crossing In mire, All on fire For your alms that she seeks without glossing; Thin, threadbare and gaunt, With her stertorous stammer, She parries a taunt By an oath like a hammer; She must live, and she shall Though by begging and luck, For our Sal Has a place upon earth like the muck. The policemen are shy of her bitter Plain speech, And they each Find a quieter neighbourhood fitter; But trust me, her lips Can frame womanly blessings, And souls in eclipse Often feel her caressings. Valeat quantum val.! But beneath the top layer Of our Sal, You may dig down to something like prayer. “WICKED BET.” Don't you know “Wicked Bet” With her forehead of brass, And her sturdy Loud wordy Delight in a “wet” And a bibulous yarn to each sociable glass, At the neighbouring tavern, With a mouth like a cavern? And with red rheumy eyes Now in rollicking leer, Now in savage surprise, Blinking over her beer. You must mark “Wicked Bet” And the shadow we shun Past enduring, Procuring Sweet souls that are let, And her black coruscations of crapulous fun; Ah, I think Adam's apple Came back to Whitechapel; While she by her art, With a living to make, Plays the infamous part Of the damnable Snake. Just observe “Wicked Bet” As she watches her prey, Like a spider Beside her Pretending to pet; If girls fall in her clutches, all hopeless are they; For she carefully angles And traps them in tangles Of promises fair, If they fidget or pout; Till they find in despair That they cannot get out. Though she is “Wicked Bet,” A noctivagous curse, With her easy And greasy Devices to get Her serpent constrictions round person and purse; If she certainly trundles Her feminine bundles, Soul, body, to hell; Yet she offers good pay, She goes with them as well And makes pleasant the way. SUE. I like Sue, And her blue Pretty eyes with their passion; And the shape of her shoulders and waist's finer fashion To which none could object, Which you would not expect In a Whitechapel gal under tatters and tears, With the slough of the slums And the stainings and crumbs Which as witness to recent debauches she bears; Yet she's natty, And chatty. I like Sue, She is true And as tender as darlings Who herd like the pigs and must scavenge like starlings For a meal, as they may, From the dustbin or way That is footed by poor men and wheeled o'er by rich; Ah, she has not your pride, And the dirt is outside And not carved into idols and throned on a niche; She's, if vicious, Delicious. I like Sue, And the hue Of her shaded brown tresses, And her wondering looks and her baby addresses; While the colour lies fresh On her healthy young flesh, All in spite of the spots which would quickly rub off, As the bloom makes its nest In the rose's red breast; It wears better than rouge, lady, though you may scoff; She is ruddy, If muddy. I like Sue, For the clue That she gives to old fountains, First principles sure and sublime as the mountains; O she carries me back To the earliest track, And behind this pale mumming and falsehood and dearth; While she breathes of the soil And the sweetness of toil, And the hand of the Maker and mothering Earth; Yes, at twenty That's plenty. JOAN. Joan is yellow And mellow, As ripe as a nut, Though a lazy great drab and a deuce of a slut; Far too fond of her snooze And unspeakable bed, And addicted to booze When her children want bread. From that lavish rotundity Hardly her choice, Out of awful profundity Comes a male voice. Joan's a pattern True slattern Of rude slummy type, For she loves a cigar and enjoys her black pipe; Like a tigress she grips With her passion her man, And her sensual lips Have the fleshliest plan; And at snuff she's no laggard Nor slow at a song— She prefers “Irish blackguard,” And both of them strong. She's a model To waddle, Her margin is such, Though she likes the gin-bottle to serve as a crutch; And her wild tawny hair, Tumbles over her face; And you well might despair, In her python's embrace; If you came to collision Or warmer caress, You would need a decision That few men possess. Joan's no stranger To danger, She laughs it to scorn, And the bully to frighten her has not been born; With her muscular arms And her terrible tramp, When excited, her charms Have an Amazon stamp; Then its idle your wooing And certain your fall, She must burst and boohooing Makes ninepins of all. OLD MEG. Many call her the “Granny” And think her a witch In their hearts, and uncanny And cold is her scritch— When she's crossed or the liquor has fuddled her brains, And her toothless gums tattle And bones seem to rattle From dolorous rust like a skeleton's chains; She is hungry and haggard, Old Meg, And she lurches With doubtful researches, On one wooden leg. You may see her on crutches That poke into drains, And explore rabbit hutches Regardless of stains; Ah, she rakes up the dung heap and scatters the dust, Or the refuse of brewers And garbage of sewers, For the maggoty offal and filthiest crust; For she cannot be dainty, Old Meg, And goes lonely Through life, and is only A scavenger's peg. Yes, a peg for the hanging Of rubbish and tins, And old bottles whose clanging Performs on her shins; Over each bushy eyebrow lies beetling a mole; She is tenth in one attic, And drags her rheumatic Pinched frame every night to that leperous hole; She appears badly cobbled (Old Meg) Of odd fractions, And all her strange actions Agree but to beg. And I doubt if a sinner Was ever more sunk And as mouldy or thinner Or happier drunk; What she eats must be little, she never buys bread, And is pleased just with pickings Of pavements and lickings Of bones from which sensible dogs turn their head; She's a desperate drinker, Old Meg, For her fancies And highest romances Transcend not the keg. MAD JANE. I've a sneaking respect for “Mad Jane” And her mission, Which veers like a vane With the chapel's last fission; For, though filthy, untrue, And unchaste as the rest, With light fingers for all that may chance to accrue, There's a spark of religion down in her dim breast; Ah, she knows she's a desperate sinner— Mere dregs, But her legs Take her faster to sermons than dinner. She appears out of place, poor “Mad Jane,” In that quarter Of blackness and bane, Like a fish out of water; Her quavering voice Can fling curses about, And she does, but she vastly prefers to rejoice With the hymn-book she never was once seen without; And it is not all humbug and shamming, I know, If her flow Of strong words takes so kindly to damning. There's a burden that rests on “Mad Jane,” And a story Like a long crooked lane, To help people to glory; And when tipsy she yet Is inspired by that zeal, And that passion consuming she cannot forget With its terrible calling she will not conceal; With her menacing arm like a prophet She raves, Till the graves Might awaken—and souls down in Tophet. She is grey and dishevelled, “Mad Jane,” And so bony; Her spirits can't wane, With the cup as her crony; When she stutters and storms “Hallelujah” I join, And I think of repentance and turn to reforms, While my hands in my coat grope about for a coin; Though next minute the preacher may stumble And flop, From a drop Just too much, yet I go away humble. FLO. In her face she is merry And brown as a berry, But not In the heart that is withered and worn And so fretted away, by the thorn And the spot Of the infamous lot That has never a morn; If at times in the drought of her trials and troubles, Like a spring in the desert her young spirit bubbles; Though the fault of poor Flo Is, she cannot say no. I can see rarest beauty In striving at duty, Through rags Of the Pariah outcast and lone With a pillow of straw or a stone, And in hags Wrecked on pitiless crags And the law's cruel throne; And I mark in this plaything of wind and the weather, Mere weakness (not wickedness) tost as a feather; The mischief in Flo Is above, not below. She is fickle and fragile, A gipsy, and agile Of limb Like a graceful and sinuous pard; Though her forehead shows years have been hard And no whim, But as breakers to swim In and leaving her scarr'd; While her coral lips often turn weary and white, And are puckered with care and the world's coward spite; But a hero is Flo, Whatsoever blasts blow. She has toppled and tumbled, And staggered and stumbled In strife, And then risen up laughing through tears In the shadow of death and its fears, When its knife Has been stabbing her life And her thoughts have been spears; But in teeth of her torturing needs for the day, From the darkness and doom comes redeeming a ray, And on down-trodden Flo Filters some of its glow. MAUD. Dainty delicate Maud Would step over a puddle, And hates like sheer poison a bother or muddle, Though she's (I confess) a mere elegant fraud; But in rainy bad weather, She fears to wet leather; You see her most carefully picking her way Like a cat on a wall that is pointed with glass, While the rough neighbours pass Plump in mud and the clay, With her Pharisee's skirt Lifted up from the dirt. Dainty delicate Maud Is so only in features And form, like those monstrous and fabulous creatures That are dragons behind, and her nature is bawd; But if now lost and shady, She was once a fine lady And drove in her carriage like you in the Park, Or (as now) drawled in icy impertinent tones Scurvy scandal of thrones And transgressed in the dark— But averted her face From stark open disgrace. Dainty delicate Maud Had an eye for a jewel, And the glimpse of a diamond served but as fuel To thievish desires—and she still loves a gawd— Till she stooped to low stealing, And hurt beyond healing; And caught she sank deeper and deeper in mire, While she drowned in the cup the last feelings of shame At the brand on her name Like the burning of fire; And hope's portal slamm'd On her, heedless and damn'd. Dainty delicate Maud With her eyes' jetty lashes, Dreads more the wet pavement and possible splashes Than staring dishonour, and now is not aw'd By the fretting of evil Like moth or the weevil; She is clean in her person, and that is a boon, And her frocks are in fashion and always a fit; Like a dead silver moon, Where as cerements sit Pretty patterns of cloud, And she carries her shroud. POLL. Poll believes she is pretty, And tosses her jetty Smooth locks in the sauciest Whitechapel way; Who shall say To her nay, When she glances with joking Sly mischief and mouth that is red and provoking, In garments of wonderful soiled disarray? All your scruples she thinks Are mere squeamish pretence, And excuses the boldest offence When she drinks. Poll I know is not steady, And always was ready For romping or crime with an equal address, To transgress Or confess: She is given to smiling At sins that you, madam, would not find beguiling And spends her whole time betwixt cup and caress; But she takes such delight If she chooses to err, That the foulest of failings in her Appear right. Poll is cheap but as charming, And some deem alarming When once she has fairly made up her gay mind; Then like wind She is blind To the biggest obstruction, And hurries along with a laugh to destruction With passion and purpose no laws yet can bind; But a method peeps out From her maddest display, And she knows when its best to delay Or to pout. Poll is company pleasant, When no one is present But you and herself and you bow to her will, Nor think ill Of her bill Which is shamefully heavy, And sums all she sees or resolves she can levy From weakness or fear that is stupid and still. But her person has points, And in rags is more blest Than the figure which rank may invest And anoints. EPILOGUE. Now the pick of the Whitechapel flowers Here are faithfully drawn, As they bloom in Tartarean bowers, Where none ever sees Dawn; Here the cream of the loafers and laggards, And the corner boys, bullies and blackguards, With the true slummy taint, In their own heathen paint, Is portrayed by the hand of affection And the heart that knows well, They could move earth as hell— If they had but the proper direction. We have seen living corpses laid bare, Evil heart, evil head, And the wedding of crime and of care At the feast of the dead; With the tares for the fire in their faggots And the horrible thoughts that (like maggots, Creeping out, creeping in) Swarm in natures of sin, And spread poison wherever they ravage; Yet a glimmer of light In the ugliest night, And the gem in the toad and the savage. Give the scoundrel a song or a sword, And a purpose in life, He will make as no velveted lord Into history strife; Do not pauperise, pet him or libel, Only arm him with prayer and Bible And a healthier stake, And his soul will awake; Rigid bonds of police can but smother The bright angel that sleeps, In those sinister deeps— What he wants is the hand of a brother. Aye, the drab, all fine feathers, and brass, Without home, without name, And despised by her kin and her class In her shadow and shame— Though an outcast, a leper, a harlot, With her sins beyond measure as scarlet That with pestilence burn— May repent and return; If her infamy now be a blister, Yet, as flame to the skies She shall shine and arise— What she wants is the heart of a sister. VINDICATIO VITÆ MEÆ. They say my life is marred and all misspent With this unceasing song and babblement Of builded words, that range in order fine Tier upon tier, and measured line on line; For thus appears to me the pictured strength Of edificial words in linked length And rhythmic revels that go on, go on, With dreadful depths on which light never shone; Great sudden doors that open into space And catch a glimpse of some sweet flying face, With tossing hair and eyes of burning blue; And endless climbing stairs devoid of clue In labyrinths of gold and azure lost, Bestarred with rosy forms astray and tost From shadow unto shadow, by hot hands That scourge and follow into love-sick lands. And yet they rise by other vaster powers Than mine, these misty and enchanted bowers Floating like silver clouds in summer air, With columned fronts and carven porches fair And finished. For I have no master's gift, Whereby these pillared palaces uplift Their lofty brows in studied insolence Of grace and marble cold magnificence. They are not my creations, though they rise In rapture, when my fancy otherwise Would shape the shining phantoms and dispose The passion of the petals that unclose Like flowers in spring. I am the instrument Of over-ruling heavenly discontent Which murmurs through me, but is never mine, With a strange human melody divine And architectural force that moulds and makes Storey on storey, till it laughs and wakes In sculptured scorn and calculated fire, Kindled from quarries of earth's old desire. So I must labour on, the tool and toy Of some calm crownèd Destiny, whose joy Fulfilled in me yet may not be my own, And wrought by me is yet to me unknown. But this I know, the purpose of the plan Which blossoms from my will, with rainbow span Of splendid words, to build a worthy dome For Him who hitherto has found no home On earth or sea in miracle of art, Nor in the praises of one perfect heart, And all unhoused by sunshine or by shade Still wanders homeless through the world He made, And though awhile He lodged in Mary's womb His universe now gives Him but a tomb. And thus I build, or Somewhat builds through me Of all past sorrows and new bliss to be, In words of worship and rock-hewn romance The symmetry and solemn circumstance Of a proportioned temple pure and meet Where He may pause and rest His passing feet, With glamoured windows glimpsing forth blue skies And blood-red passions and Christophanies. Necessity lies on me and my arm, That chisels here a face and there the charm Of shy sweet shoulders rising warm and white From scas of purple, calm and infinite, Beneath a yellow moon hung large and low Where never sunbeams walk or breezes blow; Then a young head with sad and solemn brow Bent by the awful burden of the vow Of ages past the orb of earthly aid, With hecatombs of helpless lives unpaid; And then the rush of aimless wings, that fly For ever through a lost eternity. Fate holds my hand with iron will, and paints No dying glory round the dying saints Who meet the bier as bridal kisses, lone But strong as figures wrought of rugged stone; And writes, in flame and tempest and hot tears, The insufferable message of the years. I mark the glimmer of the pearly morn, And at my heart the fretting of the thorn I feel, who know not whither I must wend Whirled to some dark inevitable end. I lie upon the naked breasts of fire Of palpitating Nature, my desire And my delight, and drinking of those wells I gather of the spirit of all spells And mysteries, and mixed with her I burn In the same fount that is the funeral urn And cradle of the worlds, where thoughts and things Arise and melt in varied vanishings Through birth and death. By many a shadowed shoal I drift to some unutterable goal, That is the starting of yet other strife Afar in other lands and other life. But still I seek the beautiful, the best, And gather precious stones and red unrest Of blushing poppies kneeling on the sod That hang their faces down before their God, The galaxy of grapes, the silver spume Tost by dim waves on shores of faint perfume, Soft tresses twined like snakes in golden braids And mocking scarlet lips of lily maids, White blossoms murmuring low to secret chimes, All fruits and fairness of all spheres and times, And silences and songs together bound By rills of praise that gush from holy ground; To clothe, in colours of the earth and sky, The houseless Presence of Divinity. And so I build, held by no mortal hand, A frescoed fane that stayed in prayer may stand A little space and be a robe inspired By One who treads the earth yet unattired And outcast, if at length I may be clothed Myself with Love to whom I was betrothed, Since first I heard the bitter cry of Him Disowned by earth left therefore lost and dim. And so I lay the polished line on line, Stanza on stanza cut of shade and shine, Poem on poem bodied out of thought, And book on book in one grand temple wrought With radiant moulding to its columned height, Whose corridors are fire and dew and light. Each verse in His great vesture is a stone, Or but the rubbish cast beneath His throne For its foundation, every word fits in And finds some part of His dear beauty kin. The spider spinning gossamers, the leaf Unfolding to the sun, the tawny sheaf With drooping head, the dew that breaks the cloud, The baby bursting from the womb, the proud Confession of pure lips that part with bliss In the red rapture of the first love kiss, The blush on virgin cheek of girl or grape, The tears of love that from the heart escape Scarcely, the noontide chant of larks, the strong Free buffet of the breeze, the evensong Of passing souls that through a door of flame And faith step from their outworn earthly frame Into the liberty of larger being — all, Like me in measure do obey the call To work, which binds us in a common guild, And by the same grand impulse wafted build The web or wonder of a painted shrine, To make this mortal dwelling-house divine. And thus I own the universal breath Of passion, shaping out of life and death My duty to the God I only know And touch in toil that trembles in His glow, Shed on the castled pile and baby's whim; And labour on, and stretch blind hands to Him. But still I see, though with the inward eye, The hidden gleam of a theophany In every little speck of space or large Event of many sides without a marge Or measure, in the worm's obscure intents, As in the upheaval of the continents; And still I know I am most surely led By devious dusky roads, where blood is shed And horrors hang, to a predestined port For which no voyage may be smooth and short Or free from perils. So I sail and sing Down life's dark river, as I strike the string Of this impassioned lute, though leaving here An altar light that gilds the atmosphere Of some torn bosom, there a blessèd thought Which scatters roses on rough paths unsought. The night is not all night, if thorny whin And stabbing stones do mock me; for within Wavers the troubled dawn of truer day; While hours have wings and bosoms much to say, That yet cannot be said unless in song— When one small word might do the Maker wrong, For whom with verse on verse I dimly raise My humble house whose only robe is praise. And still I feel the swathing of a Love That works inside my being, not above, Though far beyond my efforts blind and rude, In all the passion of its plenitude And awfulness of pure perfection, Light Invisible, and armed with maiden might Of dew and bloom and tenderness and power, The gold on breasts of butterfly and flower, The strongest frailty and the flame that tries And all the holy sweet virginities; A verity of vastness, and a grace More than the grandeur of a woman's face Just bathed in heaven and fresh from that white fount Where spirit talks with spirit on the Mount; A fearful beauty that is Life, a spell Of unimagined peace, ineffable; If I but catch mere glimpses of the wave That rolls alike through cradles and the grave And thrills through all with pulse of equal sweep, Blue gardens of the air, dark gates of sleep. I offer no divided love, I give Myself, my heart, my hope whereby I live. Thus driven by soft Omnipotence I dip My pen in dreams, and slake my thirsty lip With draughts of moonlight music and the night, And snare the starbeams ere they can take flight; While with my lonely heart I walk at will And plan new worlds and build and babble still, A child and yet a man, a penitent— And yet a pardoned soul, an instrument Of many strings whereon each passing air Awakes a note of something fond and fair, For dear dread God who shadows what must be And through the silence lays bright hands on me.
