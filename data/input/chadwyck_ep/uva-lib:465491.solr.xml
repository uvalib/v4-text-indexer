      <field name="fulltext">First Book. To MÆCENAS. Ode I. Divers Men affect divers Things; Horace the Name of a Lyrick Poet. Mæcenas sprung from Kingly race; O my Defence and sweetest Grace: Some love to make with Chariots fly The Olympick dust, Goal passed by With heated Wheels: brave Palm doth mount Earth-Lords to Gods, divine account. He's pleas'd, th' uncertain City-croud When Honours hath by Voice allow'd: This, should his Barns be swell'd with Hoard Of all that Lybian floors afford; Whom, chain'd to's Father's Grounds (strong love To th' Country-plough) great'st terms not move To cut Myrtoian seas from far, With Cyprus-keel, scar'd Mariner. When Winds Icarian Waves contend, The Merchant, aw'd, does rest commend, With rural Grange; though soon makes fit Torn Bark, for want unpractis'd yet. Some nought despise old Massick Wine, But part o'th day for th' Bowl design; Near hallow'd Fount (branch'd shade for bed) Soft-murmur'd Streams their members spread. Many there be, whom Warlike fight, Loud Trumpets noise with Tents delight, By Mothers loath'd: The Huntsman dare, Fond Spouse forgot, face sharpest Air; When faithful Dogs have view'd the Doe; Or Marsyan Boar his Toyls o'rethrow. Me Laurel, which the Learn'd does crown, Triumphant way, gives great renown. Groves, Nymphs joyn'd Quire, with Satyrs dance, Above that vulgar rank advance: If EUTERP not her Pipe restrain, Nor POLIHIMN my Harp disdain: 'Mongst Lyrick Poets me inrole, My head shall strike the Starry Pole. To AUGUSTUS. Ode 2. Many troubles fall upon the People of Rome, for Julius Cæsar's Death; the Empires hope rests in Augustus. Now JOVE with Snows and direful Hail, Hath well scourg'd Earth, made Romans pale, Whilst fired hand with Toundring powers, Toss'd th' holy Tow'rs. World scar'd left PIRRHA'S dreadful Age Reviv'd, when Monsters new did rage; And PROTEUS his Sea-cattle drove, On Hills to rove. When th' Elm did lodg the skaled Fry, Once branched Perch where Doves did lye, And trembling Does, though Forrest-bred, Swam Streams o'respread. We yellow Tiber saw recoil, From Tyrrhene Shore, fierce Waves to spoil; Romulean Tomb in proud disdain, With VESTA'S Fane. Th' uxorious Stream (for ILIA Much griev'd) while boasts Revenge, does stray The banks left side, and drowns the Land; Scarce JOVE'S command. Our Boys, (but few through Parents crime) How civil Steel made sharp that time Shall know more fit for Persian far; Hear Tales of War. What God should Romans call for stay To th' sinking Realm, what Prayers may From th' holy Nuns tire VESTA, found Deaf to their sound? Whom will JOVE chuse to expiate Past murther's stain? (disclosing Fate) White shoulders deck'd with Cloud, descend PHÆBUS as friend. Or VENUS, thou, whom smiles do dress, The attendants joy and pleasantness; Or Parent MARS, by thee respected, Stock late neglected. Now cloy'd with tedious game in Fight, Whom tumults noise smooth Helms delight; And Moorish Archers brow, to Foes When dreadful showes. Or dost thou HERMES, wing'd by birth, Through changed Form present on Earth Young man, well-pleas'd? Revenger raign Of CÆSAR stain? Late maist thou back return to Skies, Long joyful shine to Roman eyes, Nor swifter Gale bear thee from hence For our offence. Love more shouts here, Triumphant noise, Romes Parent, Lord well, stil'd rejoyce; Nor CÆSAR, let (whilst thou our Guide) Medes careless ride. Ode III. He wishes safety to that Ship whith carried Virgil to Athens, afterwards, blames mens rash adventurousness. So may most pow'rful VENUS Star, With splendid Twins which smiling are, Winds Soveraign thee protect by th' way, (All bound but mild Japiga) That VIRGIL now, dear Ship, thy Charge, With safest foot thou maist enlarge On Athens Shore; O gentle roul, And keep that half part of my Soul. That Man was stout, wore brazen Breast, Thrice plated round who first addrest With floating Plank large Seas t'invade; Nor seem'd oth' Africk Wind blustring afraid, Conjoyn'd with North in blustering fight; Sad Hyades nor South could fright: None greater Arbiter although For Storms or Calms doth th' Adrian know. Him what Death daunts? Who views each where (Unmov'd) those wandring Monsters there? Swell'd billow-mounts, those blackest fam'd Ceraunian Rocks, for splitting blam'd. In vain wise God hath sever'd Land From Seas (unsociable Band) If yet presumptuous Barks dare pry Through deeps unknown should rather lye. Men stoutly hold, all Pains t'endure, Rush through forbidden Waves secure. PROMETHEUS stole that sacred Flame, And strait 'mongst Men dispers'd the same, Which pilfer'd from th' Æthereal Tower, New Plagues, Diseases round (like Shower) O're-throng'd the World; swift grows that late But slow necessity of Fate: Stout DÆDALUS with Plumes did try Void Air (unmanly parts) would fly. Hell-Gates themselves were broke by Toil, Of HERCULES, Nought makes recoil; Nought seems so strange Man dares not do: Our rashness strikes at Heaven too; Nor will let Jove, so impious bold, His anger'd Thunder-bolts withhold. To L. SEXTIUS. Ode IV. The pleasant Spring described, and that common Law of dying; he perswades him to a Life of Pleasure. Sharp Winter's gone, whilst Spring and Zeph'rus take Their welcome turns, Ships land forsake: Nor Cattle now love Stalls, nor Plough-men fire, Fresh Meadows want grey Frosts attire: Now VENUS Revels holds by shining Moon, And Graces; fair joyn'd Nymphs in one Beat Verdant earth with Dancing feet by turns: Whilst Shop that roasted VULCAN burns Cyclopean green Myrtle-wreaths become, Or Flow'rs from Earth's dissolved womb: Now's time to sacrifice in shady Groves, Kid, Lamb to PAN, which most he loves. Pale Death doth knock with righteous foot where ere, Thatch, Kingly Tow'rs, blest SEXTIUS, there: Life's short account forbids long hope to please thee, Night strait those talk'd of Ghosts will seize thee; PLUTO'S thin House; whose Walls if once confine, No Lots there Kingship give for wine. Chang'd on good grounds.Thou shalt not there soft CHLOE admire nor love, Whose Charms th' inflamed Youth does prove. To PYRRHA. Ode 5. Horace, escaping her inticements like some Ship-wrack, doth affirm those wretched who are taken with them. What slender Youth (PYRRHA) with Roses, Whose 'nointed Head perfumes discloses? Claspt thee in secret place; Whilst Beam-like Hair, with loosned grace, Doth simple cleanliness present; How oft, alas, he'l mourn, lament? Thy Vows, Gods chang'd, and lost; Wondring to find calm Seas ore-tost, Who credulous believes thee now All Gold, still hopes for pleasing Brow: Bad-learn'd in falser Air: Those whom thy Looks (untry'd) insnare Accurst; my self wrack scaping so, Let powerful Sea-god's Temple snow On th' Wall my Thanks, where now Wave-drenched Cloaths hang up for vow. To AGRIPPA. Ode VI. Varius, the Tragedian, shall write those Wars fought by Agrippa, Horace being more fit for the describing Loves and Banquets. Varius does write thee valiant, and rehearse Thy Conquests in more large Meonian verse; Whatere the Souldier stout by Seas and Land Hath wrought through thy command. We'l not presume, AGRIPPA, those to wield, Nor Pelean wrath which knew not how to yield; False-tongu'd ULYSSES Course, Sea-wandring Flock; Nor PELOPS cruel Stock. With slender strength to dare great things of Fame: Th' unwarlike Harps commanding Muse, and shame Forbid me CÆSAR'S Praise with thine to wrong, Through fault of humbler Song. Who MARS with Coat of Adamant fortifi'd To th' height can write? or MERION black-dy'd In Troian dust? TIDIDES match for Gods, When PALLAS sway'd the ods? We Banquet-feasts, coy Virgins strugling Fight With Youths (when nails corrected found) delight To sing at ease; or fir'd with newer Love, Since oft inconstant prove. To MUNATIUS PLANCUS. Ode 7. Divers men praise divers Cities and Countries; Horrace prefers Tybur, Plancus his Birth-place; whom he exhorts to chearfulness. Some men advance bright Rhodes or Mitylene, Choice Ephesus, Corinth between Two guarding Seas; or Thebes by BACCHUS crown'd, Delphos by PHEBUS; Tempe-ground: Some Athens worth, unmoved PALLAS Station, Yield endless Verse for celebration; And th' Olive cropt from far her brows present; More minds (for JUNO'S Honour bent) Argos, Horse-stor'd; Mycæne's wealth compleat Me patient Lacedæmon's Seat. Not near transports, Larissa's Soil so good, Like House in Albune's murmuring Wood. Steep Anio's Stream, with Tibur Groves where trace Pure wandring Founts, their Orchards grace. As North-wind clear doth wipe from blackest Skie The purged Clouds, nor breeds on high Still Show'rs, so PLANCUS wisely o'rereach, delude Unwholsome Grief; life's toils conclude With mildest Wine; thee whether Tents do hold, Glistring with Ensigns brave and bold; Or thy dark Tibur's shade: TEUCER when fled His Sire and Salamine ('tis sed) He Poplar-bound his brows bedew'd with Wine, And to sad Friends did thus divine: Fortune where-ere, more kind than harshest Father, shall lead (Comrades) we'l follow rather; TEUCER your Captain guide in nought despair, Since PHÆBUS truth hath promis'd fair, That second Salamine upon new ground Shall rise: O stout and valiant found With me in worse, now Drink let griefs restrain; To morrow scour vast Seas again. To LYDIA. Ode 8. He observes the Youth Sybaris as ruin'd through her Love, and melted quite through Pleasures. Speak LYDIA, by all The Gods, why seek'st thou SYBARIS Downfal, Ruin'd through Love? MARS-field Why loaths he still? 'gainst Sun well-temper'd Shield And dust? why warlike Name Joyn'd 'mongst the Troops neglects? French Horse to tame With sharp wolf-toothed Bit? And shrinks cold yellow Tiber's wave to meet? Why shuns he Wrastlers Oyl, Like Vipers blood? nor wears skin bruised with Toil Of Armours weight? prime found For hurling Sledge, through far-thrown Dart renown'd? Why lurks he as that Son Of warlike THETIS once, near Troy's sad Fun'rals done? Of Warlike Garments free'd, Least forc'd to th' War 'mongst Trojan troops to bleed. To THALIARCHUS. Ode IX. The more sharp the Winter prov'd, he should the more cheer up, refresh himself. View'st how Soracte white does wear Deep Shrouds of snow? and Woods appear Through surcharged Branch opprest? Congealed Streams do rest. Come THALIARCH, banish cold, throw on Large piles to th' Sabine cask anon? Four years Wine thence freely draw, 'Twill Winter help to thaw. Leave th' rest to Gods, who when shall please To hush warring Winds and boyling Seas, Nor the old Ash, nor Cypress shall Be tost disturb'd at all. To morrow's Fates neglect, esteem Each new day gain'd; nor nicer seem Young sweet, pleasing Loves t'advance; Joyn'd hands in Virgin-dance. Ere testy Age befrost thine head, Now Manly fields for Action tread: Twilights whispering talk (set hour) Oft steal: now from close Bower. Dark nook fine tittering Noise betrays Some Female Wag, in skulking Maze; Pledg from Wrist of Finger taken: Forc'd though with ease forsaken, To MERCURY. Ode X. Whom he praises from his Eloquence, his Parents, his invention of the Harp, and Wrastling, with his great furtive Subtilty. Atlas Grandchild, sweet MERCURY, Who ruder Minds of old did'st frame (Smooth-tongu'd) by Voice with industry Taught Wrastlers Game. Thee will I sing, the Envoy to JOVE, To th' Gods; Harps Parent chief allow'd; Strong-brain'd when sportful Stealth does move Some Prize to shroud. PHÆBUS, when scar'd (unquiver'd then) Thee turn'd a Boy, till hid by guile ADMETUS Beasts thou brought'st agen, Pastor did smile. Guide thou, rich PRIAM for his Son Left Troy, th' ACRIDES both bereav'd, Greeks watchful Fires (through which did run) Cruel Tents deceiv'd. Thou pious Souls in blisful Bow'rs Do'st place, light Croud restraining though With Golden rod; pleasing to th' Pow'rs Above, below. To LEUCONOE. Ode XI. He exhorts her, laying aside care of future things, to refresh herself; since life so short, uncertain. Search not, LEUCONOE, what Destiny Gods have reserv'd ('twere ill) for thee and me; Shun th' Astrologick art, to lessen care; Whether more Winters JOVE ordain thy share, Or this thy Last, which tired Seas doth awe By Rocks oppos'd; drink Wine, long Hopes withdraw From Lifes short term; while speak'st th' Hour's gon with Sorrow: Use th' instant Day, believing nought the Morrow. To AUGUSTUS. Ode XII. Praising some Gods and famous Men, he descends to the Praises of Augustus. What Hero wilt thou sing to Fame, CLIO, with Harp or Pipe more shrill? What God whom Eccho chants by name? Sound's Image still. Transfer'd to th' Heliconian Grove, Dard Pindus, or mount Hæmus high; Whence Woods with ORPHEUS voice did rove Confusedly. Who learn'd in's Mothers Art; swift course Of Torrents stop'd, Winds boistrous wings, Led hearkening Oaks with gentle force, Sweet-sounded Strings. What can I speak before the Praise O'th' Parent here? who Gods and Men. Seas, Land conforms; with Time doth grace The World's vast Scene. Whence greater nought then Self produc'd, Nor like succeeding flourishes: Next honour though, for worth infus'd, PALLAS possess. Nor bold in Arms, shall I o're-shroud Thine BACCHUS; thine, chast Virgin-foe To rav'ning Beasts; nor PHÆBUS cloud With surest Bow. ALCIDES sung joyn'd LEDA'S Sons; This hors'd, that more on foot renown'd In fight; whose Stars when shining once To Seamen found. Tost Waves retreat from Rocks again; Hush'd Winds withdraw, Clouds take their flight; Fierce billows couch'd i'th dreadful Main, Aw'd by their Light. Should I chant next Romulean Merit? POMPIL'S soft Raign? Rods proudly born 'Fore TARQUIN first, or CATO'S spirit, which Death did scorn? REG'LUS, wise SCAURI, PAULUS strong, (Profuse of greatest Soul when dy'd) My Thanks shall yield most lofty Song: FABRITIUS try'd. Stout CURIUS, though rude-crested round CAMILLUS, last, sharp Want made fit For warlike use on Grandsire's ground; Mean house to it. MARCELLUS Fame, (immortal Plant) Still grows; that Julian Star aspires, Glisters to th' rest as Moon doth vaunt 'Mongst smaller Fires: Thou Father, Guard of humane kind, From SATURN sprung, t'whom does pertain, Great CÆSAR'S Charge, next thee design'd Let Cæsar raign. Let him, whilest Parthian rout o're-bold Does (Conqueror) in triumph lead, Seres which the Eastern fields behold, Those Indian-bred. Vast Earth command; less found than thee; Just Prince: with weighty'st Charret thou Shake Heav'n, those Groves that impious be Let Thunder plough. To LYDIA. Ode XIII. He seems much griev'd, that Telephus his Rival, was prefer'd before him. When Rofie Neck thou't, LYDIA, praise Of TELEPHUS, his sweet embrace, Whose softest Arm like wax intwines, O how my Liver swells, repines! Then's my Sence lost, my frantick Blood From Cheek to th' Heart, like Eb's turn'd flood, Changes it's seat: with Tears down stealing, In how slow Fires I waste revealing. Plagu'd whether some rude Brawl of mine Did that white Neck abuse in Wine: Or whether stamp'd that furious Youth Mindful Love-mark, with wanton Tooth, Upon thy Lips: but hope not Blisses Lasting from one, that wrongs sweet Kisses So barbarously, on whose soft tasts VENUS fift part of Nectar wasts. More than thrice Blest are they whose Love, Fast chain'd, no rending force can move; Nor (through complaints dissolv'd till Death) Ends sooner than the latest Breath. To the Roman State, then renewing Civil Wars again. Ode. XIV. Great Ship, unblest; shall new Floods drive again To th' stormy Seas? O what do'st do? retain Strongly the Port: dost thou not see, Sides void of Oars they be? How thy torn Mast, wounded with th' Africk wind, And Sails do groan, small cordage left design'd, Vessels, Planks, how weak, unsure Seas dreadful wrath t'endure. Nor canvas whole beheld, nor Gods on breast, There worn for Signs t'invoke, when new distrest, Of Pontick Pine though made so good, Chief ranger on the flood. Dost brag thine antient Stock, and empty name? Scar'd Seamens trust in painted Boards disclaim: Cease, unless thou would'st to th' Rock And Winds prove laughing-stock. O thou that i'th' late Storm mine anguish wast, But now my grand Desire, choice care at last, Gulphs avoid, those narrow Seas Which wash bright Cyclades. NEREUS his Prophesie of the ruine of Troy. Ode XV. When Pastor false did through the Seas convey, In Ida-ship, that Hellen-guest from far NEREUS swift Winds to loathsome ease that day Lock'd up, that stern Events of War. Might chant, foretel. Thou mischief brought'st to Troy, Whom Greece with numerous bands will soon require; Conjoyn'd by Oath to break thy Nuptial Joy, With PRIAM'S ancient Realm thy Sire. Ah-me! what Sweat doth bath both Horse and Men! What Fun'rals thou dost bring to th' Dardan race! Now PALLA'S Helmet, Shield, her Charret clean Provides with fury too for Chace. In vain, through VENUS guard, more haughty grown, Thou't comb thy Locks and Women please with Verse, Unwarlike Cithern-sound, divisions shown; In vain thou't seek those Spears (so fierce To th' Bridal bed) wing'd Cretan Darts to shun; Wars monstrous Noise, or AJAX swift beguile, Those Locks perfum'd, adulterous Hairs (out-run) Thou shalt though late with Dust defile. Dost not regard ULYSSES, Ruine sound To thy grand Stock? slight'st Pulian NESTOR thus? Thee straid pursues undaunted TEUCER round, Joyn'd SALAMIN, stout STENELUS. Skilful for fight, or when doth Horse command Swift Charioteer: thou't MERION prove too well; TIDIDES, lo, with raving thoughts at hand Doth seek, his Sire who did excell. Whom thou wilt fly like Stag (his food forgot) The Wolf beheld, when from the Lawn doth rouze, With high-rais'd panting breast, for softer Lot, Though promis'd bigly to thy Spouse. ACHILLES wrong'd, with Navie incens'd, the dire, Confounding Day of Ilium shall adjourn: But, certain Winters past, the Grecian fire shall Trojan wealth and houses burn. To his Love. Ode XVI. He recants, asking her Pardon for his wronging her in some Iambicks; laying the blame on his Passion. O Daughter fairer than the Mother fair, Give those my guilty Iambick verse (nor spare) Any Doom which most shall please, Devouring Fire, or Adrian Seas. Not CYBEL great (nor PHÆBUS there who dwells) So shakes the Mind of Priests in hallow'd Cells, LIBER so, nor shrill-tun'd Brass, Beat Coribants mad Priestly race, As Anger moves; whom neither Norick Sword Can daunt, nor Sea, with Wracks tempestuous stor'd: Cruel flame, nor JOVE'S dread Voice, When hurries down with thundring Noise. PROMETHEUS parts from divers Beasts (as fam'd) To that chief Mud conjoyn'd, when man he fram'd, Forced so, and did invest With furious Lyons Heart our brest. Anger o're-turn'd, with ruine did confound THYESTES wretch; that plows the Cause and ground Of lofty'st Cities overthrow, Till th' unappeas'd, insulting Foe. Their Plough hostile hath drawn quite ore the Walls Thy mind allay Me too (which Youth befalls) Fervent Heat more strongly mov'd, Till of those hasty Verses prov'd Composer wild; now wrangling Jars to change I wish for gentler Mood, would'st thou less strange (Obloquies recanted more) Turn'd Friend, thy first kind thoughts restore. To TYNDARIS. Ode XVII. He invites her to Lucretilis, shewing how much Content it might afford her. Swift PAN Lyceus oft doth change For fair Lucretilis, there range; And my Goats defend from thence, Shun'd scorching Heat and storme offence. Wives to the strong-scented Spouse may rove, Through Woods secure, for Thyme their Love, Sculking Crabtree Branch; nor fear Green-spotted Snakes as harbour'd there. Kids scorn that Woolvish Forrager, Those Valleys, TINDARIS, how far, Rocks of leaning Ustica, Resound his Pipes melodious Play. Gods me protect, kind Gods reward My honest Heart; Muse too regard. Dainties County-bred shall slow, And plenteous heap on thee bestow. Here in close Vale withdrawn, retir'd From Dogstar's heat, to th' Harp (desir'd) Thou Circe glassy-cheek'd mai'st sing, Penelope, Love's rivalling. Here gentle Cups ith' Shade shalt pour Of Lesbian wine, that mirthful Hour, No Mars nor Bacchus Fray molesting; Nor fear, lest midst our friendly Feasting, Thy churlish Guardian chance to know, And rude-bred Arms on thee should throw (Hard-match) that Flowry Wreath you wear, And guiltless Garment (last) should tear. To VARIUS. Ode 18. Wine moderately drunk makes Chearful, but immoderately Furious. Varius, no Tree before the sacred Vine For Tibur-plant, sweet gentle Soil, design; God does propound things hard where brains be dry; Corroding Griefs this routed makes to fly. Who chear'd with Wine sharp Warfare, want condoles; But (BACCHUS) thee, fair VENUS, thee extols. But least some LIBER'S sober Gifts exceed, Let Centaurs Braul with Lapithes fear breed; And BACCHUS dire to Thrace: Men past their bound, Greedy of Lusts (small difference) confound Both right and wrong, kind Bassareus, I never Shall force thy Will, nor toss thy Secrets ever, With Vine leaves hid thy Berecinthian Horn. Fierce Tabers hold, whence blind Self-love is born; T'advance the Proud, though empty Crest, assaying; Trust prodigal, close thoughts like Glass betraying. To GLICERA. Ode XIX. He seems enamour'd on her Beauty. Fierce Mother of desires, And Youth, dispos'd for amorous Fires. With wanton Ease me move To softer thoughts, forgotten Love: View'd GLICERA'S bright cheek, Bore Parian marble pure, and sleek: Conjoyn'd coy, pleasing Grace Enamour'd has; enslaving Face. Whole Venus falls on me, Whilst left her Kingdom Cyprus free: Nor let's of Scythian write, Or Parthian stout; those things recite. Green Turf and Vervin there, Boy, place; sweet Frankincense then bear; Full bowl of Wine; to Love Sacrifiz'd, She may gentler prove. To MÆCENAS. Ode XX. He invites him to a smaller Banquet. Dear Roman Knight; cheap grape Sabine (Small, gentler draughts) shall be thy Wine; Which in Greek Butt my self did close, When Shouts arose I'th' Theatre; till Tiber-banks, Thy Country-stream to sound in thanks, (Conjoyn'd Mount Vatican) Thy praise began. Cæcubian Juice, with press Calene Grape tamed drink; our Cups but mean Choice Falern want, no liquor fills From Formian hills. Upon DIANA and APOLLO. Ode XXI. He exhorts the Maids and Youths to chant their Praises, by Romans us'd Soft Virgins joyn'd DIANA'S worth proclaim; Young Men record unshorn APOLLO'S Name; Their Mother last latona bright, Trancendent JOVE'S delight. Chant her whom Streams, Woods, branched shades please so, (Young Girles) which on Mount Algidus do grow; Whom dark Thicks Erymanthian hide, Green Cragus top beside. Whilst Youths advance sweet Tempe's Grove, renown'd, And Delo's too APPOLLO'S native Ground; Her shoulders praise with Quiver deckt, His Brothers Harp respect. This mournful War sad Plague and Famine he, Drawn by your Suit, (whilst Romans CÆSAR free) Amongst that large Britanick race, And Persion foes shall chace. To ARISTIUS. Ode XXII. The pious Life is safe every where, prov'd by his own example. The Man upright, pure Innocence Nor Maurish Bow, keen Darts defence, Nor Quiver (FUSCUS) swell'd doth need With poyson'd Breed. Whether scorch'd Lybian sands doth trace, Cold Caucasus, unpeopled place, Or where Hydaspes Champains wide Doth lick, divide. For even my self in Sabine Grove, Whilst chanting LALAGE did rove, Past bounds unarm'd, wolf stalking by Seem'd glad to fly. Such monstrous Beast ner' Dannia fed In her vast Woods, nor Affrick bred, Where JUBA raign'd; dry Nurse though she Toth' Lyons be. Set me in barren Plain, where grows No happy Tree that cheered shows By Summer-gale; which Fogs orecloud, Malignant shroud: Or set beneath Sol's burning Car, Scorch'd Land where view'd no dwellings are; Sweet-smilling LALAGE shall prove (Sweet-tongu'd my Love. Green Turf and Vervin there, Boy, place; sweet Frankincense then bear; Full bowl of Wine; to Love Sacrifiz'd, She may gentler prove. To CHLOE. Ode XXIII. He says, there was no cause, why she should fear to touch a man; being grown ripe for Marriage. Thou shun'st me, CHLOE, like some Faun, Which seeks fear-stragled Dam through Laun, Mountains wild; whom simple Ayr, And Woods with toys do scare: If through th' attendant Gales o'th' Spring Leaves tremble ought, use murmuring: Lizards green the Bramble shake, Both knees and Heart do quake. Though I pursue not thee to rend, Or spoil, the Lyon's, Tyger's end, Now thy Mothers wing, if ere, Ripe grown for Man, forbear. To VIRGIL. Ode XXIV. Who immoderately bewailed the death of Quintilius; against much sadness. What measure fit, wise shame to th' vast Desire Of that dear Friend, MELPOMENE inspire, Through mournful Strains, whom Cithern joyn'd clear Voice, Thy Father JOVE allow'd most choice? Do then eternal Sleep QUINTILIUS hold? Whom Modesty, pure Faith, that Sister bold To justice, naked Truth adorned so; When shall the World his Pattern show? By good men wept, deplor'd dy'd worthiest He; Though wept by none, kind VIRGIL, more than thee, In vain thou beg'st Quintilius back, that was Not so by th' Gods bestow'd, alas! What if thou could'st more sweetly sound thy strings Then ORPHEUS, charming Trees? those senseless things: Yet would not Blood to th' Ghost return, where ere, Whom once with dreadful Rod severe. HERMES hath forc'd amongst that darkned Train; Nor can smooth Pray'rs past Fates undoe again: 'Tis hard indeed; but what we can't oppose, Nor mend, by Patience lighter grows. To LYDIA. Ode XXV. He insults over her, that growing Old, she was justly despised by her Lovers. The scornful Youth less rapping play At Windows now, nor e're the Day Wake thee; thy constant Door may feet Lov'd Threshold still; Which did before smooth Hinges press So oft; thou hearst now less and less, One speaking without.Thy Servant pend with waking brow Sleep'st, Lydia, Thou? Youth past, thy Self must weeping moan For thy hard-hearted Loves (alone) I'th' dismal Port, Winds blustring found; Night darksome round. When such hot raging Lust (forlorn!) As th' Horse's Minion fires, shall burn Thy Liver, till proves ulcerous; Complainest thus. That jovial Youth loves delicates, Green Ivie, Mirtle-branch, sweet baits; Dry trash for HEBER'S Ice, (decay'd) Northern River. Winter's comrade. To his Muse, touching ÆLIUS LAMIUS. Ode XXVI. It becomes not Lovers of the Muses to be ore-plung'd in Sorrow; praising LAMIAS. I Muses friend, commit dull sadness, Fear To th' churlish Winds, through Cretian Seas to bear: What Merchant toward North-star Prince o'th' Stormy Realm may scar: Or what grand King, TYRDATES may affright. O gentle Muse, whom full clear Founts delight, To other Champaign-flow'rs come down, Weave for my LAMIAS a Crown: Mine honour nought does his advance, alas! Without thy help, joyn'd Lesbian Harps sweet grace; Which well becomes thy Sisters, thee To consecrate eternally. To his Companions, That they should not quarrel in their Cups, barbarous fashion. Ode XXVII. The sober Jug, thing born for chearful use, In quarrels, Frays 'tis Thracian-like t'abuse; Come, such barbarous fashion leave, Nor modest Cups of mirth bereave, Through bloody Brauls; with Wine and Candle-light How vastly jars that Persian sword and fight? Friends, such impious Clamour cease, And still lean on your Couch in peace. Must also I sharp juice Falerian share? Then let Megella's brother strait declare, With what Wound he's blest, indeed, With what Love-dart do's closely bleed. Refuse you then, at lower price than this No drink: whatere inthralling Beauty 'tis; She burns thee not with shameful Fires, Unworthy Love, since thy Desires Flow generously still: whoere it be, Lay't up in faithful ears. Then is that She? With gulf, alas, Charibdis-dame Thou struglest fit for nobler Flame. What Witch, Magicians art, what God is he, With strong Thessalian herbs can set thee free? To that three-form'd Chimæra ty'd, Scarce Pegasus shall thence divide. Ode XXVIII. ARCHYTAS a Philosopher and Geometrician is brought in, answering a Mariner, That all must die; desiring he would cover his dead Corps upon the Sea-shore. Thee ARCHYTAS, whose Geometrick skill Measur'd Earth, Seas, unnumbred sand, Small shroud of dust (bestow'd) confineth still, Near Matin Port; nor profits (scan'd) T'have search'd those Ayery Rooms, Stars mansion, Or travell'd round the Pole, since dead. Grand Pelops Sire, though feasted Gods, is gone. And Tithon like to gale is fled: Minos which of JOVE'S Counsel seem'd, so sage; Sunk too, twice dead Pithagoras, Who own'd for his, as liv'd i'th Trojan age: Euphorbus Shield when by did pass Nor more than Nerves and skin black Death allow'd; Whom you'l confess for Author great In natures Truth's; but all one night do shroud, All once that Ghostly Road must beat: War oft doth make sad Games for dreadful Mars; Seas tost their greedy Seamen drown; Mixt fun'ral-pile both young and old declares, None daunts fierce Proserpina's Frown. My self North-blast, Orions blustring Mate, Has almost plung'd in gulphy seas; But, Mariner, don't thou in naked state My Head and Bones through careless race, Sand-heap deny; so let Venusian Woods Those mischiefs feel, which Eastern wind, (Thou safe) shall threaten to th' Hesperian floods; Much wealth still flow to thee design'd From righteous JOVE, NEPTUNE, Tarentum-friend. If dost neglect which falsness pain May cause thy guiltless Brood at thy last end Such fun'ral-Rites with scorn Disdain May thee befal: Heaven Prayer regard what's more, Nought shall, attone release for such base heart: 'Tis shorter work, but sprinkle sand thrice ore My naked Corps, to Seas depart. To ACCIUS. Ode XXIX. It was a wonder, that he, laying by Philosophy for love of gain, should turn a Souldier. Iccius, thou envy'st now so sordid grown, Th' Arabians wealth, i'th War inrolled one 'Gainst fierce Saban Kings, untam'd; And chains for dreadful Mede hast fram'd. Which of their barbarous Girls, her Spouse struck dead, Shall prove thy Concubine, sing thee to bed? What Court-youth, perfumed Boy Thy Page and Skinker's place enjoy? Whose nimble art makes Seres Shafts to fly From Father's Bow? that streams, who can deny, Might lofty mounts climb recoil'd ascend; And Tiber back his waves extend. When thou, PANETIUS learned Works each where Bought up, admir'd Socratick house severe (Promis'd fairer things) do'st change For Coat of male, to War must range To VENUS. Ode XXX. He begs of her, that she would come into the House of GLYCERA, devoted to her. O VENUS, Onide, and Paphos-Queen, Cyprus condemn'd, please t'enter in GLYCERA'S bright House, since calls thee thence Much Frankincense: Thy ardent Boy, those Graces fair, Ungirt with Nymphs let strait repair; Fresh Goddess-youth mild, joyn'd with thee, And MERCURY. To APOLLO. Ode XXXI. He asks not riches of Apollo, but a sound mind in an healthful Body. What begs thy Poet, craves whilst he, Grand PHÆBUS to thy Deity Pours forth new Wine, not wealthy Corn By fat soil'd Sardinia born: Plump Heards which scorch'd Calabria yields, Gold, Indian Iv'or nor those fields Which Lyris gnaws with stream from far, That smooth, silent wanderer. Let those whom Fortune much doth bless, Grapes lopt with hook Calenian press; Rich Merchants guilded bowls exhaust, Wines that Syrian Wars did cost; Who, lov'd by Gods, twice thrice the year Can plough the Atlantick Seas, storm-clear: Good Olives, Succhory's my food, Light Mallows Earth's more vulgar breed. Me, PHÆBUS, things prepar'd and found, At home, sound Body, Mind as sound, Old Age not loathsome, gently Grant; Nor sweet Citherus touch to want. To his Harp. Ode XXXII. He desires that it would be present as his Partner and Companion in Musick. Ddear Harp, what we conjoyn'd, at ease, In Shades have sung, let Live and please, Still I desire; come now, rehearse, Chant Latin verse. First by ALCÆUS tun'd alone, Who, Warrior stout with Navy gone 'Midst Arms themselves, or Anchor-bound To the moist Shore-ground Did LIBER, Muses, VENUS sing, And Boy which still to her doth cling Choice MYRNE too, black-hair'd and ey'd; Changed on good grounds. Thence beautifi'd. Hail then, thou PHÆBUS-grace, and meet For JOVE'S high Board, O charming sweet 'Midst Toils or Sorrows to my Heart, When Called art. To ALBIUS TIBULLUS. Ode XXXIII. He exhorts, that he should not grieve too much in that a Rival was prefer'd by Glicera before him. Albius, grieve not too much, still musing on Ungentlest GLYCERA, nor chant thy Moan In doleful Songs, since th' art out shined-now By Junior through her broken Vow. That fam'd, with slender Front, LICORIS burns Through Cirus love; whilst scornful Cirus turns To coy, sharp PHOLOE; but sooner shall Kids seek out Wolves to close withal. Then PHOLOE that Leatcher prove combin'd: Such VENUS will, who's pleas'd, th' unsuting Mind, Unsuting Form with brazen Yoak of Love, In cruel wanton sport to prove. My self, whom choicer Beauty woo'd in vain, Mirtale has inthrall'd in grateful Chain; More angry, fierce than th' Adriatick wave, Which 'bout Calabrian Creeks does rave. To Himself. Ode XXXIV. He seems troubled after some Prodigies, that following the Epicureans, he had less devoutly served the Gods. I of the Gods late slothful Worshipper, Whilst Frantick stray'd through sensual Wisdom far Am compelled mow, by force, To turn my Sails and former course To steer again: for th' Author of the Light, Rending thick Clouds with fiery Flash and bright, Charret oft through purest Air Hath drove with thundring Steeds held rare: Whilst stupid Earth and wandring streams did quake; Yea th' horrid Doors of Tenarus dire Lake, Sticks beneath, with Atlas-bound. God can exchange base things from ground, With most sublime; does draw forth things obscure Whilst darkens splendid Ones, their heights unsure: Fortune oft with mournful noise Robs these, gives those a favour'd Choice. To FORTUNE. Ode XXXV. He begs of her, that she would safely preserve Cæsar, going against the Brittains. O Goddess, which most grateful Antium sways, Still present power from lowest Earth to raise Mortals up, or triumph proud With slaughters, Funerals to cloud; Thee courts with anxious Pray'r, the Husband-man, Poor rural Brood: thee who Carpathian Brine provokes with sturdy Oares, As Empress of the Seas implores. The Dacian fierce, wide-rambling Scythian thee Do fear, wall'd Towns, unconquer'd Italy: Wombs that foster'd barb'rous Kings, Purple-cloath'd Monarchs in their Springs; Lest with injurious foot thou shouldst ore-turn Their standing props of State, or people burn Through lawless Rage; force peaceful Men To arms, just Rule confounded them. Thee ushers still severe Necessity, In whose brass Hand those riving Wedges be, Monstrous Nails, sharp Clinches too, With molten Lead past strength t'undo: Hope too, rare Faith (since worship still) attend, Clad in white Robes, nor thee renounce for Friend; Pomp though lately chang'd, as Foe, Thou didst their pow'rful Seats forgoe. But that unfaithful Croud, and perjur'd Whore Shrink basely back; false Friends do soon give o're, And avoid the dreggish Tun; Kind simpathizing Yoaks dosy shun. Our CÆSAR Shield, to th' Britains marching now, Furthest o'th' World; new raised Bands guard thou, Which may form to th' Earth a Law, And red-cheek't Western Main o're-aw. Alas! we now blush for our Civil Skars, Last Brethren, Rapes; what mischief worst in Wars Has this hard Age declin'd? what stands Untouch't? or whence have bolder hands Withdrawn through fear o'th' Gods? What Altar spar'd Inviolate? O, wouldst thou these impar'd, Blunted Swords but forge anew, 'Gainst Massagets, th' Arabian Crew. To POMPONIUS NUMIDAS. Ode XXXVI. For whose return from Spain be much rejoyceth. With Frankincense combine Calves offer'd blood, sweet Harp to please NUMIDA'S Guard divine, Who now return'd from Spain, at ease, Gives kisses store to Friends; Though then dear LAMIAS enjoys None more, whom Love commends; Since both one Tutor had when Boys. Both chang'd for manly Gown Same time: with white stone mark the day: Nor mean-fill'd Cups drink down, Rejoyce, in more transcendent way. Let DAM'LIS not outvaunt Bassus at Thracian Boul, though she Drinks deep nor Roses want, Nor smallage, Lilly frail, be free All fix on DAMALIS Moist eyes, nor rend from her admiring New Love joyn'd Arms with his; Like wanton Ivy clasp'd, aspiring. To His COMPANIONS. Ode XXXVII. Whom he exhorts to Mirth, for the Actiack Victory. Now let us drink, now freely dance; Now's special time, Comrades, t'advance Banquets 'fore the Gods on Bed, Like MARS his Priests, bespread. Some crime Cæcubian Grape 't had been To draw till now, whilst Ægypt-Queen Sought through Romes sad funeral For the Power Imperial. With her diseased Heard and Train, Foolish to hope what not in vain, Drunk with her sweet Fortune made; That fury though alli'd, When scarce one Ship exempt from firing: Whose frantick Soul, through Wine aspiring, CÆSAR taught by humbling more True Fears, with nimblest Oar. Pursuing her flight from Italy, As Hawk doth tender Dove (or he That scours through plain Æmonian Plains The Hare) to tie in Chains That fatal Bug: who, being of Mind To perish Gallantly, declin'd Sword-bred Female Fears, nor sought For sculking Corners ought, But Pallas durst destroy'd behold With front compos'd: nay Vipers cold, Shrouding each as Bosom-guest, Drank Poyson through the Brest: More fierce through studi'd Fate, as though Disdain'd in Liburn Ship to go, And a Queen, no common head, Proud Triumph to be led. To His SERVANT. Ode XXXVIII. He bids him prepare nothing for the setting out a Banquet but green Myrtle only. Boy, Persian furniture and State, All busie Circumstance I hate; Flow'r-Crowns, displease, nor Roses seek Where late do stick: Toil not, bring simple Mirtle alone; Nor Wayter thou need least disown Mirtle, nor I, whilst drinking Wine Near shady Vine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HORACE HIS SECOND BOOK OF ODES. To C. ASINIUS POLLIO. Ode I. He warns Pollio, that he would lay aside writing of Tragedies awhile, till the State were more composed: praises then his Writings. Those Civil broils, METELLUS Consul when, Causes o'th' War, it's faults and various chance (Fortune's sport) sharp sidings then; What Leagues great Persons did advance; Arms 'nointed bath'd with Blood nor purged ere; Work (Friend) of doubtful Die, more dangerous Thou handlest, tread'st on Fire (as 'twere) With Embers hid, deceitful thus. Sometime withhold from Theaters thy Muse, Severe-voic'd Tragedy, till well ordain'd Publick State; grand Task peruse Then more, with Buskin nobler-strain'd. POLLIO, chief Life to men in Sad affairs, To th' Senate-court for Councel's deep design; Laurel Wreath, Dalmatian Wars, Whom made with endless glory shine. Just now with Squadrons threatning murmur, noise Thou strik'st our ears, strong Pen; there Fifes resound, There glistring Arms, scar'd Horse (no poize, Bit felt) with Horsmen's looks confound. And now, methinks, their mighty Leaders speak, Maid foul, besoil'd with not uncomely dust; All the world subdu'd grown weak, But CATO'S sturdy Mind and just, JUNO'S withdrawn, and whatere friendlier God To th' Affrick race, left impotent that Coast; Spoil'd by some o'th' Victors brood, Seem'd Offrings to JUGURTHA'S Ghost. What field manur'd with Roman blood to all, By Sepulchers, our impious Civil Jar Speaks not forth? th' Hesperian fall Resounded unto Medes from far. What swelling Gulf, what streams boast ignorance Of dismal Broils? what Daunian Sea indeed, (slaughter-stain'd through our mischance) What Coast from Crimsom gore is freed? But (sportive Muse) lest, Mirth abandon thus, Thou should'st thy self to Funeral-songs compel, Citherus light, softer strains let us Recount in Dionian Cell. To SALUSTIUS CRISPUS. Ode II. He praises Proculeius for his freeness towards his Brethren, contempt of money makes Men only blessed. No splendor Gold nor Gloss affords (O Crispus, hating bury'd Hoards In greedy Earth) till from that Mine With use it shine. Long-liv'd shall Proculeius be, To's Brethren Father-like and free; On lasting Plumes surviving Fame Shall bear his Name. Thou't greater rule checkt fonder Mind, Covetous thoughts, then if (combin'd With Gades Lybia) thine were Both Penians there. That dire self-nursing Dropsie grows, Nor slak'd till Cause from whence it rose Be purg'd, and Languid Humour fail, In body pale. Vertue, dissenting from the Croud, Not ranks, with blessed Troop the proud Phrates on CYRUS Throne, by vote; But vulgar throat. Forbids false Voices so to spend; And wealth, sure Crown to him commend, Who slights large heap, not casts the eye Back squintingly. To DELIUS. Ode III. Hither Fortune must be used moderately, since all are subject to that dying condition. Wise even Mind in Fortune's frown, And Smiles retain; not much cast down, Nor swell'd with insolent jollity, For my DELIUS thou must dye: Whether in Grief thy days be clos'd, Or Festivals on bank repos'd, With Wine of Mark conceal'd and best, Choice Falernum, th' art made blest: Where the White Poplar lofty Pine Their Boughs for courteous Shade entwine; Where fleeting Brook laborious ways (Trembling Stream) obliquely strays. Bid hither Wine, sweet Unguents bring, Flow'rs, lovely Rose soon perishing: Whilst wealth and Youth, three Sisters yet (Joyn'd their Sable Wheels) permit. Thou House shalt leave, thy purchas'd Foods, Grange wast'd with yellow Tiber's floods; Those piled heaps of Golden bliss Some unthankful Heirs call his. Though rich thou be'st, of Royal race, Or poor, Field-born for Rank, and base, To that unbrib'd infernal Womb Sacrifice thou must become: All thither forc'd; Death shakes the Urn; Whence early or late Lots pour by turn, And we by Stigian Boat are sent To eternal Banishment. To XANTHIAS PHOCEUS. Ode IV. There was no cause why he should blush, for loving a Serving Maid; since the like hath been done by many Noble Persons. Nere, XANTHIAS, blush to love a Maid, Captived Girl, Briseis sleek ACHILLES mov'd (one proudest said) With snowy Cheek. Termessa's form her Master turn'd AJAX in love; ATRIDES great (For close) through conquer'd Virgin burn'd, In Triumph's heat; When slew those barbarous-termed Bands, Thessalia's Chief and HECTOR dead, Troy left to th' weary'd Grecian hands, Soon ruined. PHILLIS gold Locks may bring the Grace, Her Father's Son in law design'd; For sure she mourns as Regal race; Gods prov'd unkind. Think not she's chose from Vulgar Croud, Or, (scorning hire, so faithful, she From Mother base (unworthy Cloud) Can issu'd be. Face, Countenance, choice Limbs of whom I chastly praise, quench jealous Fears, O'th' Man whose Age doth almost sum Full forty years. Ode V, for some good Reasons is omitted. To SEPTIMIUS. Ode VI. He wishes for the Seat of his old age those pleasant Places Tibur and Tarentum. Septimius, who wouldst range with Me Gades, from Yoke Cantabria free, Rude Syrtes last where Moorish Wave Does boiling rave . Be Tiber (whom that Argive chose To build) mine Ages soft Repose; To me, when tir'd with War, an ease: Land-travells, Seas. Which Fates if shall forbid unkind, Galesius silver Stream I'l find, Rich stock'd, and Lacon fields, where (said) PHALANTUS sway'd. That Nook o'th World my Fancy greets Most smiling, where to Hymet-sweets Honey nought yields, and Olives fair VENAFRUM dare. Where Springs prolong'd, and gentle Sky Warm Winters breeds; where Aulon high, Bounteous in Grapes, nought envies those FALERNUM shows. That place, those joyful Hills invite Thee, me, where on warm Dust (as right Sad Coals of thy Prophetick Friend) Thou Tear shalt spend. Yo POMPEIUS VARUS. Ode VII. He congratulates his return into his Country. Often led near to that dying hour, POMPEY, with me, when BRUTUS rul'd the War; Roman safe restor'd what Pow'r To Country-Gods, Italick air? Thou my Companion chief, with whom I oft More lingring Summer's day have broke in Wine; Crowned Locks, with Unguent brought From Syrian quarters, made to shine. With thee Philippos view'd, when running Course I took for Flight, Shield thrown but badly away; Haughty ones, through shatter'd force. With Chin when touch'd the bloody Clay: But me, kind Poets God, swift MERCURY, In dark Airs Cloud through foes transported then; Drawing Gulf did hurry thee To th' raging Straits of War agen. Therefore to JOVE vow'd Festival prepare, And couch thy toiled Limbs through fight (at last) Beneath my Laurel-branch; nor spare Those Tuns devote for thy Repast. Smooth Goblets fill with Grief-forgetting Wines Campanian, from larger Vessels pour Unguents forth; who strait combines Moist Smallage, Myrtle from the Bow'r. For Banquet-wreaths? whom shall Loves Queen commend Sole Arbiter for drink? Carouse more glad, Thracian-like, since thus my friend Enjoy'd, 'tis sweetness to be Mad. To JULIA BARINE. Ode VIII. There was no Cause, why he should trust Barine's swearing, since she grew Fairer through her Perjuries. If punishment had seiz'd thee ere; BARINE false for Perjury, Did'st fouler by black Tooth appear, Mark'd Nail unfree; I should believe; but thou (ingag'd By Oaths that faithless Head) dost shine More splendid far to th' Youth enrag'd; Their Care, Design. It profits thee, urn'd Mothers dust Through Vows abus'd those Signs of Night To cheat whole Heav'n; Gods made unjust; Scorn'd Death's affright. VENUS does laugh at these too ill; Fond Nymphs, fierce CUPID jeer their parts; While points on bloody Whetstone still His flaming Darts. Youth's Flow'r grows up to thee besides New Servants spring, the Old leaving nought That Roof their impious Mistress hides Though threaten oft. Thee Mothers for young Sons do fear, Thrifty old Sires thy tempting Gale Their Husbands least transport, o'rebear, Spous'd Girls grow Pale. To VALGIUS. Ode IX. He exhorts, that at the length he would leave mourning for his dead Boy Mystis. Thick Winter-show'rs not always barren Ground Drench from the Clouds, nor vexed Caspian Main Tyrant-storms do still surround; Nor does the cold Armenian Plain Lodg sluggish stupid Ice, Friend VALGIUS, Through all the Months; nor griev'd with Northern Wind Th' Oaken tops of Garganus, Nor Ashes stript of leaves still Pin'd. Thou seek'st with Weeping strains (as quite undone) Lost MYSTIS still; nor when view'd the Evening star, That which flies swift Morning-sun, Those Love-complaints abandon'd are. Yet NESTOR old, which liv'd to Men's third Age, Not still his Son ANTILOCHUS deplor'd Still Trojan Parents with griefs rage, Nor Sisters wept young TROYLUS gor'd. Cast off at length those soft and weak Laments, And rather let's new-conquer'd Trophies chant Of CÆSAR, th' Empire's large extents; That North Niphates joyful vaunt. And Median streams grown scanter Torrents now To their first Lords, conjoyn'd to th' Realms captiv'd: Bounded late Geloni too; Ranging small Fields of large depriv'd. To LICINIUS. Ode X. Moderation is to be used in either Fortune. You'll better live, not still (Ambitious, vain) Mounting high Seas; nor wisely goar'd the Main (Those stormy Ills) much shelfy Shore retain. Who seeks the Gold-mean (safe) nor proves annoy'd With rotten House and filth, nor troubled cloy'd With pompous Roof, much envy'd wealth enjoy'd. Tall Pine-trees oft through churlish Winds be crost; Aspiring Tow'rs with grievous Fall are tost: Proud Hills the Thunder strikes, opposes most. Well-temper'd Mind in Fortune's Ebb is taught To hope, when flowing fears Change with weary thought, Foul Winters JOVE drives hence who hither brought. Now Bad not always holds; APOLLO uses Sometimes well-pleas'd, to awake those silent Muses With Citherus touch, and stern bent Bow refuses. In straits be Valiant strong, whilst want prevails More stoutly Row; as wise, when fuller Gales (Prosperous times) contract thy Swelling Sails. To Q. HIRPINUS. Ode XI. Omitting Cares he should live chearfully. What warlike Cantaber, fierce Scythian (HIRPINUS) plots from us by Adrian wave Divided Realms, like busy man To search forbear; life so deprave; Which else not much doth need, soon vanish'd hence Smooth, comely Youth; and hoary head dry-grown Chaces from our duller Sence. Blith Loves, more easie slumbers gone. Not always view'd like Glory in Spring-born Flow'rs; Nor clear-cheek'd Moon like-formed still doth shine: Why wasted thus thy feebler pow'rs? Nought crosses Heav'ns nere-chang'd design. Why Friend, beneath that Plain-trees shade (repose) Or this Pines branch neglected garb (our Hair Though Grey perfum'd with vernant Rose, And Syrian nard) while Death doth spare, Do we not drink? Wine eating Grief dispels Like scatter'd Cloud. What Boy more nimbly shall Stop that gliding Stream which swells, Thence Falern Grove allay withal. Why LYDE that loose walking Girl from home Invites as guest? wish her with Ivory Lyre, Hair bound up more slightly, come, Smooth knots, Laconian attire. To MÆCENAS. Ode XII. Graver things suit not the Lyrick verse; Horace will sing only the Beauty of Lycinnia. Bid me not Sing fierce long Namantine Wars, Dire HANNIBAL; nor joyn Sicilian Jars (When Penian blood with Purple dy'd the Main) To Citherus softer strain. Stern Lapithæ, mad-drunk HYLÆUS Pride; Earth's monstrous Ofspring tam'd, by strength outvy'd Of HERCULES; whose Gyant-band severe Heaven's gorgeous Roof did fear. And thou in larger strains of History CÆSAR'S grand Wars, MÆCENAS passing me Canst strongly write; what haughty Kings did wed The Chain in triumph led. Me thy sweet Girl LYCIMNIA'S dainty Voice My Muse bids Chant alone, that brightest Choice, With Sun-like radiant Eyes, proclaim, admire Firm Brest with mutual Fire. Whom never yet disgrac'd her Feet to move 'Mongst dancing Troops, nor witty Strife to prove; Nor when with Maids joyn'd hands in sportive Play On DIANA'S Holy-day. Would'st thou the Treasure of that Golden hair, Lycimnia wears, exchange for th' Wealthy share Of ACHAMENE? for all th' Arabian Hoards, What Phrygian Soil affords? When wreathed Neck for kisses sweet applies; Or else with easie Harshness wh[illeg.] Denies; Those joys enforc'd by th' Asker more contenting: Sometimes kind She preventing. Ode XIII. Upon a Tree, with whose sudden Fall he was dangerously oppressed: No Man surely knows what to avoid: the Praises of Sappho and Alcæus. That Churl, false Tree, by whom thou first didst stand, On hapless Day with sacrilegious hand, To th' whole Town's shame implanted thee; And ruine of Posterity. I could believe, he brake his Father's Neck; Strow'd Lodging-rooms by Night (as meant to deck) With slaughter'd Strangers crimson Gore; Yea Cholchis-poysons us'd before. All good renounc'd with Mischief still combin'd, Who, doleful Log, thee for my Field design'd: Tumbling down from Earthen bed Upon thy guiltless Master's head. None can all Hours full Caution us'd beware, Know what t'avoid; the Penian Mariner, For blind dark Fates nought scrupulous, Dreads only foaming Bosphorus. Our Souldier fears the Parthian Shaft in flight; Rude Parthians Roman strength and Chains affright: Various, as unlook'd-for, Death Hath seiz'd, will seize our mortal breath. How did we view those Under-Realms (as t'were) Black Proserpine's, Æacus judging there, Bow'rs of pious Souls portrai'd By SAPPHO'S verse whose plaints upbrai'd Her Country-Girls, on Greek Æolian strings: ALCÆUS to resound more lofty things On golden Harp, those Ills in War, Banishment, Seas sustained are! Both Ghosts admir'd; whose chanted strains, excelling (Worth sacred Silence still) though Kings expelling, By horrid fight, the burly Croud Drank through their Ears, as most allow'd. What wonder? when that hundred-headed Beast Let fall (amaz'd) black Ears and lofty Crest At those sweet sounds? when wreathed Snakes 'Bout Furies locks the Pleasure takes. Prometheus self, with Tantalus esteem'd Their pains deceiv'd, this Charm so pow'rful deem'd: Nor ORION wish'd to view Scar'd Lynx, stern Lyoness pursue. To POSTHUMUS. Ode XIV. Life is short, and Death most certain. Ah! POSTHUMUS, swift years do glide; Nor Piety, best means apply'd Can Time's furrow'd Front, old Age Retard; stout Death asswage: Not PLUTO though each day, for ease, Thou with three hundred Bulls dost please; Example sad may Titius show, Three body'd Gerion too; Whom that black Wave confines, where must All Sayl Earth's Sojourners and dust: Be it King with haughty Brow, Mean Peasant from the Plough. We shun Wars bloody chance in vain, And billows tost i'th' Adrian Main; Fondly Autumn's blast, South-wind, To th' Body's health unkind: Black Cocyte's wandring, drowzy Flood Must we behold, besmear'd with blood; DANAUS Girls, SISIPHUS beside To th' Stone's long labour ty'd. Thou House, fair grounds, Conjugal love Must leave, nor of thy planted Grove Tree but Cypress loath'd, i'th' end, Shall their frail Lord attend. Thy Wines Cæcubian nobler Heir, (Now lock'd with hundred Keys) shall share; Wash thy Marble Pavement, though Priest-Feasts less choice oreflow. Upon that AGES LUXURY. Ode XV. Huge, Princely Buildings will ere long allow Few acres ground to th' good laborious Plough; Ponds each-where so largely vain, Like Lucrine Lake; th' unmarry'd Plain, For simple Shade, will Vine-lov'd Elms devour; And Myrtle branch, Violets, each garden Flow'r Olive-plots with Odours spread, Which former Lords much profit bred. Twin'd Laurel Bow'rs the Sun's offensive rays, Beam-darts exclude; King ROMULUS his days Rough CATO, wiser Antients Gave no such Rules nor presidents. Whose private small, but great their Common Treasure; No Gallery, found ten foot wide for pleasure, Then by frugal Purses made, Set ope to th' Northern Bear, cool shade: Laws suffering not vain-glorious Flesh despise, When fortune would, cheap Turfy shroud; more wise, Temples, Towns at publick charge Aim'd with new Stone to grace enlarge. To GROSPHUS. Ode XVI. All desire quiet of Mind, which is not gain'd by Wealth, nor Honors, but by curbing the Affections. Who on the large Ægean Sea is tost Rest begs o'th' Gods, when Silver Moon ingrost By ugly Clouds, and Seamen's know Stars lost, Quiet Thracian loves, though fierce for War inroll'd; Quiet the Mede, with Quiver spruce and bold; Not, GROSPHUS, bought by Purple, Gems, nor Gold. For 'tis not Wealth, nor Consul's Lictor proud Can drive from hence the Minds tumultuous Croud; Those fluttering Cares gilt Vaulted Roofs ore-cloud. His Little's blest, whose Father's Salt rub'd clear Shines on his sober Board; nor with base Fear, Desire his Pillow curs'd, but sweet Sleeps there. Why, Marksmen-like, Dart we at much for one Short Life? invade Lands warm'd with a new Sun! Who, Country fled, from his own self can run? Foul, guilty Care brass-beaked Ships ascends, Lies sculk'd aboard; 'mongst Troops of horse attends; More fleet then Stag, th' East-wind which Tempest sends. The Mind for present glad, should 'bout the Rest Not grow disturb'd; harsh Bitter things with Jest Well temper'd bear; no State's intirely blest. Swift Destiny ACHILLES seiz'd in's prime; TITHON consum'd through lingring Age; and time Drops me perchance for thee things too sublime. Thine prove some hundred Flocks, 'bout thee there lows Most wealthy Herd of fat Sicilian Cows; Thy Chariot-mares do neigh, Wreaths deck thy Brows: Twice Purpled Wools thee cloath; to me belong Small Country Grange, slight Muse for Grecian Song From faithful Fate; despis'd the envious Throng. To MÆCENAS, being sick. Ode XVII. Who should he dye, Horace saith that he would be loth to outlive him. Why dost thou kill me thus, MÆCENAS lov'd, With thy Complaints? 'tis nor by Gods nor me, That thou should Dye the first, approv'd; My States grand Pillar, dignity. Ah! should some swifter Fate thee seize, controul, (My Souls best Half) why stay I th' other part? Nor pleasing then, nor perfect Soul, Surviving thee; that day same Dart Shall ruine Both: nor have I sworn in vain, Perfidiously; we'l go, we'l go (howe're Thou precede) Companions twain For that last Voyage bent appear. Nor shall Chimæra's bulk fire-breathing though, Nor hundred-handed GYAS from thy side Ravish me; great justice so This pleased hath, stern Fates beside. Me whether Libra, or dreadful Scorpius, (That fiercer part of my first native hour) Views, or Capricorn, which does Like King th' Hesperian Waves o're-power. Both of our Stars, well-matcht for Influence, Strangely concur; thee JOVE'S assistant Beam From SATURN'S spightful Ray did fence, And dull'd as 'twere those Wings supream Of hasty Fate: when popular Shouts did spread Thy Praise thrice round through the ample Theatre, Me Tree's falling Trunk upon my head Had slain, but Wood-god's hand did bar The mortal stroak. Art's Patron thou, chief wealth To th' learned Train, when rais'd thine Offering Perform'd i'th' Temple vow'd to Health: We meaner Lamb to th' Ax shall bring. Ode XVIII. He saith, he is Content with smaller things, whilst others cherish vain Desires, as if they should ne're Dye. No Ivory, Gold roof My House does dress with Gorgeous stuff; Nor Marble beams dear-bought Columes from furthest Aff'rick brought O're-press; nor House or Land False-Heir'd usurped by my hand: Nor Lacon Purples spin Tenants chast Wives to cloath me in: But Truth that treasure yet I have, convenient share of Wit. Rich court my Rank though Poor, Nor trouble I the Gods for more; Nor my great Friend, as one Happy in Sabine field alone. This Day doth the other press And new Moons growing Old decease, Thou Marble near death's doom Send'st forth to smooth, forgot thy Tomb, Buildst Houses brave, the Shoar Would stretch where Seas at Baya roar: Distend them still in Pride, With narrow Bank not satisfi'd. Why, Churl, enlarg'd thy Grounds Still more, beyond next Tenants bounds Dost greedy Leap, advance? Man, Wife's driven out for vagrant Dance, Their Gods in bosome born; On back their sordid Brats and torn: No surer Hall of state Though waits their wealthy Lord from Fate, Then th' hungry Infernal Den: Why striv'st for more? to th' basest men, King's sons Earth's opened free; Nor churlish Stygian Guard (we see) Gold-brib'd, or caught by slight, Would row PROMETHEUS back to Light. This curbs proud TANTALUS, With's Regal race; this called does, Uncall'd, with Boat addrest Convoy the poor tir'd Man to rest. On BACCHUS. Ode XIX. Inspir'd by Bacchus he chants forth his Praises. I BACCHUS on remotest Rocks did see Teaching prime Verse, believ't, Posterity: Nymphs did learn, Goat-footed, mute Satyrs with ears acute. Evæ! my mind through sudden Horrour quakes, Whilst troubled Joy, brest fill'd with BACCHUS shakes: Evæ! Liber hold, suspend; Through branch'd Spear reverend: 'Tis lawful now thy froward Priests to vaunt That Fount of Wine, those Milky streams to chant BACCHUS sends, and the Honey show From hollow Trees doth flow. That honour of thy blessed Spouse beside, Added to th' Stars; Pentheus Roofs deride, Tost by thee nor ruine small; With Thrace, Licurgus fall. Thou bridlest Floods, thou barbarous Seas dost tame; Thou (Wine-bedew'd) on desert Clifs dost frame Churls toth' Biston Priestesses, Strange Viper-knots for dress. Thou when that vile Gigantick rout, one time Thy Fathers Kingdom sought by Hills to clime Rhæchus didst with Lyon paws Repel and horrid Jaws. Though fitter much for Dancing Troop, for sport And mirth affirm'd; nor canst so well Consort Fighting ways; yet Arbiter For peace or bloody war. Thee CERBERUS, when view'd, durst nought assail (With golden Horn) but gently wag'd the Tail; Thy departing Fleet (to this) With treble Mouth did kiss. To MÆCENAS. Ode XX. Horace turn'd into a Swan will fly through the World; thence promising himself, his Poems should be made immortal. No small nor vulgar Wing shall me transport (Poet Two-form'd) through gentle streaming Air; Nor will I with Earth consort, But mount, then Envy greater far: World's Cities left, though mean-descended, I, (That man whom thou dost call in Favours sign Belov'd) MÆCENAS, will not dye; Nor shall Styx-wave my Ghost confine. Just now sharp Skins upon my Legs do sit, And I into that whitest Bird am chang'd, Th' upper part soft Plumes do fit My shoulders, hands, in order rang'd. Now swifter than Dædalian ICHARUS, Those groaning Shores of Bosphor I will view; Sands of parched Getes, thus; Loud-chanting Bird, North climates too. Me Colchus shall with Dacian know (so stern, He'd seem to slight our Troops) Geloni cold; And Spaniard skilful me shall learn, Those French that Rhodan drink, sold. Keep then far off vain Funeral-Elegies; Sow'r dismal Moans, Complaints, as Death my share; Noise reprove, discharg'd by this Idle honours of the Sepulcher.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HORACE HIS THIRD BOOK OF ODES. To C. ASINIUS POLLIO. Ode I. The happy Life consists not in Wealth, or Honours, but in a contented Mind. Drive hence that barbarous vulgar croud More sober rank to hear allow'd; Muses Priest, new Verse I bring, To Youths and Maids do sing. As Kings oresway with awful brow, Themselves to JOVE'S command must bow; Styl'd glorious through Gigantick fall, Chief head imperial. This Man much larger Bounds extends, Wide-planted Soyl; that man descends MARS his field for noblest voice; Bright fame doth third rejoyce. Virtuous esteem'd him client-store: Whilst Fate by equal Law raigns ore High and low, Death's monstrous Urn Casts forth each Lot by turn. Who o're his Neck sees hung drawn Sword, Not best Sicilian food o'th' board Can force sweet Relish there, or please; Birds, Citherus chant no Ease. Nor lull to rest: soft Sleep disdains Not meanest Roofs of country Swains, Shaded banks, nor Tempe Grove Where Cephyrus doth rove. Who seeks but just enough nor's vext With Seas inchafed rage, perplext Through Arcturus setting Star, Kids rising, whence storms are: Nor Vineyards Hail, of grapes bereav'd, Nor lying Ground for Crop deceiv'd; Fruits of scorching Stars, much rain, Hard Winters though complain. Fish feel their Seas abridg'd and scanted, Such monstrous Piles i'th' deep implanted; Whither rubbish stones are brought By Tasker, workmen oft, Proud Lord himself: but threats and Fear That Lord attend climb wheresoe're: Black fac'd Care his Ship bestrides; Behind on's Courser rides. But if sad thoughts nor Phrygian stone Bright Purple like the Stars (least groan) Can ease; nor Falern choicest Vine, Persian unguents fine; Why should I Porch of envi'd height With Pillars build, new-fashion'd State? Why change my Sabine Vale and Home For Wealth more troublesome? To his FRIENDS. Ode 2. Youths should be bred up from their tender years to hardship, Warlike life and painfulness. Hardship to bear, Friends, let the lusty Youth Through practis'd Warfare learn, that sharper skill; Parthians vex well hors'd, with smooth Bright-pointed Spear made dreadful still: And spend his Life abroad couch'd under Sky, In dangerous course; that Mother o'th' young King (War made for Virgin, marriage nigh) From walls beholding him, heart-sting, Could sigh; Ay me! let not fair princely Spouse (Rude 'mongst arm'd Bands) ore desperately provoke The Lyon's paw, that Anger rouze, Which slaughters all with deadly stroke. Sweet, comely 'tis for Countries good to Dye, Since Death pursues the flying Man as fast; Hams of that faint-hearted fry Nought spares, nor fearful Backs, at last. True Virtue, worth, not knowing base Retreat, With pure untainted Honours shineth fair; Nor takes those Axes up (power great) Lays down for vulgar-breathed Ayr. Virtue, which Heaven unlocks to th' Nobler Souls, Immortal rank, strives through incumbred ways; Pop'lar croud but scorns, controuls Like dirty Earth, and wings doth raise. Yea safe Reward has cautious Silence try'd; Who mystick CERES hallow'd things o're free Divulge, nor shall imbarked glide, Nor lodg beneath same Roof with me. That Father of the Day, neglected when, Hath th' honest scourg'd with those incestuous oft; But near foregoing Impious men Vengeance (though Lame) doth leave uncaught. Ode III. The virtuous Man fears nothing: Juno's Oration of the fall of Troy, and Roman Empire rising from it. The just liv'd Man, grown firm unchanged still, Nor People's hear (when lawless Acts doth will) Ought can shake his solid Mind; Nor urgent Tyrant's look, southwind, That blustring Lord o'th' restless Adrian Main; Nor JOVE'S great hand when Thunder tears the Plain; Though the Worlds crack'd frame should fall, That Ruine strike undaunted shall. Trusting this vertuous art, Pollux admir'd, And Hercules to th' Starry Tow'rs aspir'd; Between which pair AUGUSTUS grac'd, With rosie Lip doth Nectar tast. Tigers this way, deserving BACCHUS, thee Transfer'd to Heav'n, whose necks (ungovern'd, free) Bare the Yoak: Romulus gone, By Mars his Steeds scap'd Acheron. Which JUNO mov'd, as grateful thing, with joy; To th' Councel of Gods thus spoke: Troy, pompous Troy, Fatal Judge unchast, unwise, And forrain Woman brought for Prize Convert to Dust; from th' time Laomedon Broke promise with those Gods; condemned Town That with its Captain false by me, Minerva prov'd; for vengeance free. Now neither shines that Guest admir'd to th' fair, Spartan Adulteress; nor strength though rare Hector thought, strong Grecian Bands Sunk Priam's perjur'd House withstands. Which War, fomented by our fierce Desires, Hath found a Close; thus done my angry fire; Loathed Grandchild ROMULUS, Whom Trojan Priestess bare to us, To MARS my Son his Sire I leave, inclin'd, That he shall drink (for our bright Seats design'd) Nectar-juice; place firmly hold, 'Mongst number of the Gods inroll'd. What time that long and mighty Sea doth rage 'Twixt Troy and Rome, let Trojans blest each Age (Banish'd though) rule every where; So Priam, Paris Tombs may bear. Insulting Heards and Beasts those Vales command, Lodg close their Cubs, secure; let shining stand The Capitol; fierce Rome as head Give Medians laws, in triumph led. Name, far most horrid grown, let this extend To th' utmost Coasts, where midland-sea doth rend Europe from burnt Africk shore; What fields swoln Nyle doth wander o're. Rome stronger term'd, since rather can despise Earth-bury'd Gold (whilst dark concealed lies) Then forc'd for humane use to bring, With hands that grasp each sacred thing. What bound soere o'th' World, South, Northern Pole Let Rome make feel her Arms, bent to controul; What way the Sun with fires doth rave, Or Clouds and Frosts their dwellings have. But conquering Fates be thus by me divin'd To th' Roman Troops, if over-pious, kind (Too proudly swell'd) they don't to view Troy's antient Cynder-tow'rs renew: Troy born again, with dismal Omen thus Reviv'd, shall prove again destroy'd by us; Led by me Triumphant Hoast, Who as JOVE'S Wife, and Sister boast. Should Walls of brass, strong PHÆBUS Author found, Thrice rise by turns, thrice should those beat the Ground By Greeks and Spouses pris'ners led Thrice mourn for Husbands, Children dead. But solemn Thinge scarce sportive Harp do fit: Muse, whither run'st? chant not with bouldest Wit High Parleys of the Gods, nor wrong Great things through small-composed Song. Ode IV. The Poet affirms, that he was freed from many Dangers through the help of the Muses; and that those had been unhappy who have opposed the Gods. Descend, CALLIOPE, from Sky, Arts Queen with Pipe's long Melody; Or if proves clear-tuned voice, Cythern, PHÆBUS Harp thy choice. Hear you? or doth some Frenzy's play Delude? methinks I hear, and stray Through those hallow'd Woods where flow Silver streams, fresh Gales do blow. Those talk'd-of Doves in Vulter-found, Near my Birth-soil th' Apulian ground, Me a Child, when Sleeping head (Toil'd through sport) with green Leaves spread. Which thing might all amaze that hold High nest-like Acherons if told, Baltine woods or fruitful Plain Doth Ferentum low contain. That I should sleep preserv'd from Bear, Black Vipers brood, and Quilt-like wear Sacred Laurel, Mirtle given (Infant bold) through power from Heaven. Your's Muses, tall Sabine mounts I clime, or should Præneste Founts, Shades, declining Tibur please, Liquid Baiæ near the seas. Friend to your Springs and dancing Train, Nor routed Hoast Philippian, Palinurus rock, nor Tree Fire devote could ruine me. Whilst you my Guard, attendants thus, Well-pleas'd th' enraged Bosphorus Dare I mount, and travel o're Scorcht Assyria's sandy shore. Brittains to strangers fierce I'le view, And Thrace where Milk horse-blood they brew; North-Geloni quiver-arm'd, And that Scythian stream, uncharm'd. You CÆSAR great (when tir'd with War, His troops in Vinter-quarters are) After Toils desiring ease. In Piærian Cell do please. You give him gentle Rules and kind, Rejoyce when given: how JOVE did grind Wicked Titan's monstrous Rout When Thunder bolts he tost about. Who dull Earth stormy Seas doth sway, With sad infernal Realms, barr'd day; Gods and mortal crouds alone Rules from just Imperial Throne. Great fear that horrid Youth, at length, Did cause to JOVE, since bold in strength; Brothers, Pelion bent to spread On Olympus gloomy head. But what Tiphæus, Mimas strong? Porphiriou dreadful-broad and long? Rhæchus stout, Enceladus Darting torn up Trees, when thus Dar'd charge against the sounding Shield Of Pallas wise? here Vulcan steel'd Rav'nous show'd, whilst JUNO there; And he who always Bow doth bear; With pure Castalian Fount bedews His large-comb'd Locks, doth hunting choose Lycian Groves, where Native wood (Delian APOLLO) stood. Force councel-void with its own weight Doth fall, whilst Gods advance to th' height Force well govern'd; hating too Bad strength all Mischief prone to do. Prime witness to my Verdict free Let hundred handed Gyges be; And Orion who assail'd Chast PHÆBE, by her Arrows quail'd. Th' Earth grieves; upon her Monsters cast, Whose Of-spring Thunder'd down at last To ugly Hell: nor fiery power Ætna's load can eat, devour. Nor Titius breast doth Vulture leave, But lustful Sins close Jaylours cleave: Sad Perithons (o're bold Lover) Chains three hundred hold. Ode V. He sets forth the Praises of Augustus, Shame of Crassus, Constancy of Regulus. We do conclude, that Thundring JOVE doth reign In Heaven above, on Earth AUGUSTUS sways, Now stil'd God, who British train To th' Empire joyn'd, with Persian race. Old CRASSUS Souldiers once with barbarous Wives Base Husbands liv'd, and under Arms grew old: O Senate wrong'd! corrupted Lives Of Father in Laws Hostile controll'd. Serv'd Median King, Marsians, Apulians bred, Our name, gown'd worth, and conquering Shields forgot; Eternal VESTA'S Fires not fled, JOVE safe with Rome from thralled blot. This Regulus sought warily to shun, Averse from foul conditions with the Foe; Lest that Example should forerun Succeeding times vast Overthruw; If Youth once seiz'd not absolutely Dy'd, Slave-terms renounc'd. I Banners saw, said he, On Punick Temples hung, beside Forc'd Arms, our Men from slaughter free. Rome's Citizens, arms wreath'd behind their Back, I saw inslav'd, ope stood the Gates secure; Fields spoiled once by us (not flack) Some of our Bands did till, manure. With Gold redeem'd, more sharp for following Fight They may return; you'l plead, you add but Loss To th' foul Offence; chang'd Colour bright, Woolls scarce restor'd through second Gloss: Nor does true Vertue like, if conquer'd fall, To be for worse reserv'd loath'd slavery; Though Stags unloos'd may fight with all, Toils broak; shall that Man valiant be? Who yields himself to th' treacherous Foe's commands? Will Penians he next fight oreturn? dismai'd? Who endur'd their smarting Bands, Sot-like, of grisly Death afraid. This, ignorant mens Arms best life bestow, Joyns peace with furious War; ah! shameful he! Grand Carthage, thou dost taller grow On ruines made of Italy. Chast Wife's last Kiss (they talk) with Children's last, He shun'd, as now grown baser Head, captiv'd; Fix'd on earth (obliquely cast) His manly Look; nor seem'd reviv'd, Till had confirm'd the doubtful Senate round By an Advice, ne're given before at all: So still banish'd Man renown'd, Hastned to's sad Comrades in thrall. Though knew what pains by th' barbarous Torturer Reserv'd for him, yet with no secure Port (Friends remov'd which joyn'd to bar His prompt return, and Vulgar sort) Then if long Client's Cause; that troublous Crew, Things now dispatch'd, forsook fresh Air to take; behold Venafrian fields, or view Tarentum-Town for pleasure sake. Ode VI. To the ROMANS, touching the corruped Manners of that Age. Roman, thou Grandsire-crimes shalt rue, Till falling Fanes o'th' Gods renew; Cleanse those Images, with smoak, Grown foul, which you invoke. Whilst yield to th' Gods chief Empire's thine; To those both first and last resign: Gods contemn'd pour'd Vengeance free On mournful Italy. Now twice Monæse, Pacorus hand Hath foil'd our hapless Roman Band; Glistering, since joyned prize each day To their small Chains, more gay. Dacus and Æthiops hy might Rome neer destroy'd 'midst Civil spight; Dreadful that through Navy deem'd, For Archers this esteem'd. Our vile, Sin-fruitful Age abus'd First Nuptial beds, thence stain diffus'd; Slaughters from this Fountain flow'd Through th' Common-wealth abroad. The Virgin grown must learn to Dance Ionick-ways, by Art can prance; To Study from a Child begins Base loves, and early Sins. Younger Adulterers then seeks, Her Spouse or'e gorg'd with Wine, nor picks One i'th' Dark, to whom she may Snatch'd Lawless Joys display; But open call'd, and Conscious too Her Spouse, does rising jet below; Free for Merchant Pilot's game, Dear purchasers of shame. The Youth from no such Parents sprung Dy'd Seas with blood from Punick wrung; Whence ANTIOCUS did fall, PYRRHUS, dire HANNIBAL: But manly Race, more rustick-born, Stout-bred; who practis'd oft (no scorn) Sabine ploughs, would loaded bear Cleft logs, if Task severe Mother impos'd; when Sun did change The Mountain-shades, and loos'd at Grange Yoak'd Oxen tir'd; night drawing on, Well pleas'd day's Charret gone. What will not hurtful Time impair? Our Fathers worse then Grandsires far, More tainted Us produc'd; who will Leave fouler Off-spring still. To ASTERIE. Ode VII. He comforts her touching her Husbands absence; and warns her, that she should prove chastly Faithful to him. Why weep'st ASTERIE for GYGES thus? Known constant Youth? whom soft Favonius Will Spring-time come, with Wars restore (Blest) from Cilician shore. He driv'n to Oricus by northern blast, Through Goats distemper'd Stars, cold nights does waste As Widower, eyes waking though; Whence Tear-shed Streams do flow. But Agent from his troubled Hostess sent, Chloe, how she (whisp'ring) does sigh, lament; Sadly burns with thy Love-flame, Tempts thousand ways, to blame. How treacherous Wife, through forg'd accusing Spells, Less doutful Prætus mov'd; this boldly tells; Till strange Death was inflicted on Th' o'rechast BELLEROPHON. How PELIAS plung'd large way to Tartarus, Since fled (more nice) Hippolite; this does Falsly breath; such Story-train, Sin-lectures though in vain: For he more deaf than those Icarian Rocks (Still true) such voices hears: but least unlocks Neighbour thy Heart, love, fancy breed, Young ENIPUS, take heed: Though none amongst their Troop his equal found For skilful Horsmanship, on MARS his ground: Nor for naked Stream, besides, So swift through Tiber glides. Night come, shut close thy Doors, nor glance below, When his complaining Pipe does Summons show: And though calls thee oft at will Hard Heart, be cruel still. To MÆCENAS. Ode VIII. Why though unmarried be observ'd that month of March Mæcenas should not wonder. What's meant, since Batchelor, from hence, This March as for Wifes goodness pray'd; Why Flow'rs, this Pot of Frankincence, Coals, Alter lay'd; Learn'd in both Tongues, dost thou admire? I Feast had vow'd to Bacchus, know, White Goat since caus'd me near t'expire Trees falling blow. This day each Year kept Festival, Pitch'd Cask shall rouze (for drinking Mood) When TULLUS sway'd, though smoak'd withall Since Consul stood. MÆCENAS, take from rescu'd Friend A hundred Cups, and watchful Light Bring forth till Dawn; hence clamour send, Jars banish quite. Those dumps discharge for City state, Since Cotison's great croud orethrown; Self-burdenous Mede, through strifes of late, In Arms does groan. That antient Foe from Spanish soil Now serves, though tam'd with later Chain: Scythians, their Bows unbent, recoyl From warlike Plain. Disturb'd for Publique good, ore-sowr, Shun too much thought, since private head; And snatch those Guifts o'th' present hour, Severeness fled. To LYDIA. Ode IX. A Dialogue touching their past Loves, and the renewing of them. Ho. Whilst I was grateful to thy Sence, Nor other Youth more pleasing Arms did bring; Clasp'd round thy purest Neck, from thence More blisful far I shin'd then Persian King. Ly. Whilst thou didst with none other Flame More fondly burn, nor LYDIA march'd behind CHLOE, I then (with greatest Name) That Roman ILIA most bright outshin'd. Ho. Me Thracian CHLOE governs now, Taught sweetest Notes, and learn'd in Citherus skill; For whom I'l Dye with fearless Brow, So Fates spare her, my Soul surviving still. Ly. Me scorcheth too with mutual Fire CALAIS Orinthus Son which does revive; For whom I twice shall gladly expire, So Fates preserve the Youth, keep him alive. Ho. What if first Appetite return, And link us both in lasting Brazen chain? If gold-hair'd CLOE scorned burn, And Door stand ope' to Lydia lov'd again? Ly. Though he's more fair then splendid Star, And thou more Light then floating Cork, then high Rough Adrian Sea more angry far, With thee I'l choose to Live, with thee to Dye. To LYCE. Ode X. He warns her jesting way, that laying aside harshness she would pitty him. Though furthest Tanais, LYCE, thou didst Drink, Barbarian's Wife, thou wouldst not then (I think) Me prostrate near thy cruel Doors expose To th' Northern Wind which constant blows. Hark how thy Gates do sound, how all before Thine House, behind, the Trees do blustring Roar; And th' Air so purely sharp, serene the Sky, That Snow's, congeal'd, does frozen ly. O cast from Beauty, sweet, sow'r, harsh Disdain, Least fades, and I recoil; nor beg again: Thy Roman Sire not thee PENELOPE Begot, still Deaf to Lover's Plea. O if no Presents can, nor Prayers meek, Nor Lover's pale, grown Violet-like Cheek, Nor that thy Servant's turn'd PIERIA's Slave, Thee move, incline, through Mercy save. Most hard like sturdy Oak, like Africk Snakes Unpittiful; this Flesh, which almost quakes, Not still upon thy Threshold thus can lye, Grapling with Storms extremity. To MERCURY. Ode XI. He begs of him, that he would teach him some Songs, whereby to move the Heart of Lyde, joyning that Story of the Danaides. Mercury, taught by whom Renown'd AMPHION mov'd with Voice the Stones; And seven-string'd Lute, that canst resound The Lover's moans; Nor Languag'd once, nor lov'd, though now For Rich men's boards and Temples art; Chant Songs, that LYDE coy may bow Both Ears and Heart. Who like young Colt does Play at ease, And trip the Fields, to th' Touch averse, Unmarry'd Girl, nor taught to please Stout Husband fierce. Thou Tigers canst Comrades and Trees With ORPHEUS lead Floods caus'd to stand; Porter o'th' Hell-court, till crouch'd on Knees, Didst charm, command: Vast Cerberus; though hundred Snakes His Fury's head did Guarding throng; Whose Jaws black Fog, filth-voiding Lakes, With treble Tongue. Titius, Ixion's pains were eas'd Through forced Smiles, th' Urns standing dry Short term, whilst DANAUS Daughters pleas'd With Harmony. LYDE their Fact, known Punishment Declare, their empty Tun, the stream Still pour'd still flowing forth by vent; Last Dooms no dream: Which Faults attend in Hell, to fright. O impious Shees! what more abhor'd? Since kill'd their Husbands in one Night With cruel Sword. One Girl 'mongst Fifty worthy said, Their Nuptial Torch, brave Lyer found To th' perjur'd Sire; most noble Maid, Still glory-crown'd. Who call'd to her young Spouse, Arise, Least lasting Sleep o're takes, (from whom Not dream'd) bad Father in law surprise, Worst Sisters come. She-Lyons which as Calves do tear Their Spouses round, more melting though, I'le not kill thee, nor Pen thee there For fatal Blow. Me load my Sire with hardest Chains, Since Gentle spar'd my wretched Spouse; Imbark to th' far Numidians, Expell'd his house. Go where swift feet, Winds bear thee thus, Night, VENUS shroud; good Omen have; And sad Complaint remembring us On Tomb engrave. To NEOBULE. Ode XII. He blames her, that being taken with the Love of Liparus, she led a sloathful life. 'Tis wretched Lot neither Love's sweets to tast, Nor, Sorrows wash with sweetest Wine, but fear An Uncles swadling Tongue; perplex'd; at last VENUS wing'd Boy from thee does Distaff bear. NEOBULE, thy Web's choice private art, Young LIPARUS his Form hath banish'd quite; Who excels Bellerophon for th' Horseman's part, Not overcome by Race, nor sturdy Fight, Or nointed when doth swim through Tiber's Flood: Skillful for Dart, when flying Stags invades From roused Heard through open Fields; as good And swift t'assault the Boar from sculking Shades. To the Fountain BLANDUSIA. Ode XIII. He promises an Offering to that Fountain, and commends its pleasantness. Blandusia-Fount, whose Cheek-like glass most bright, Worthy sweet Wine, and Flow'rs; to Morrow's light Grives thee Kid in Sacrifice, Whose Front first horn'd doth rise. In vain that Off-spring from the wanton heard Both lust, and Frays intends with Rival fear'd; Since soon he shall besprinkle ore Thy Stream with crimson Gore. The burning Dog-star's time and wrathful power Cannot touch thee, who dost refresh that hour Plough-share weari'd Ox, as kind To th' wandring Sheep inclin'd. Thou too shalt one o'th' Noble Springs be made; Whilst I that Elm commend, whose Branches shade Shrouds th' hollowed Rock from whence below Thy pratling Streams do flow. To the PEOPLE of ROME. Ode XIV. He praises Augustus, late returned out of Spain a Conquerour. Like Hercules, behold again (Since Laurel priz'd at life they sought) CÆSAR his Houshold-Gods from Spain Has Victor brought. March forth each Wife of single Spouse, To th' Gods yield Sacrifice, first plac'd Sister to th' Noble Chief; your brows With Fillet grac'd. Mothers of safe Young men enjoy'd, Youths last, new-marry'd Wives, which thus Spectators prove, bad Speech avoid, Spightful, ominous. This day, true Feast to me, like Cloud Black thoughts dispels; no tumult ere My heart (grand CÆSAR Prince allow'd To th' World) shall fear. Go Boy, for Unguent, Garlands run, Wines old as Marsyan broyls advance; Rambling Spartacus croud some Tun If scap'd by chance. And wish shrill-voyc'd NÆERA too Bind up her Myrrh-perfumed Hair; If Porter loath'd cause stops, ado, Fond waiting spare: Gray head damps, mitigates the mind, Else prone to Brauls and quarrelling; My Youth, when PLANCUS Consul shin'd, Had scorn'd that thing. On CHLORIS. Ode XV. That growing Old she should set bounds unto her Wantonness. Wife of poor IBICUS, thou must At length set bounds to thy long wicked Lust; Those fam'd Venerean Toyls, and all, Since neerer grown thy speedy Funeral: Leave playing amongst the Virgin-train Those bright-Cheek'd Stars with gloomy Cloud to stain. Not what's for Phloe fit doth thee, CHLORIS, become; thy Daughter may more free Push ope' the young men's Doors, like one With BACCHUS Taber wild, and maddish grown: Whom NOTHUS love can make to Dance, And sport like wanton Kid, if Eye but glance: Grown old, thy Huswife's Wheel at home, Lucerian Woolls, not Citherus touch become: Nor purple, Roses youthful Flower; Nor Barrels drunk atilt till Dregs do pour. To MÆCENAS. Ode XVI. All things lye open unto Gold, but Horace seemeth happy in his smaller Fortune. Clos'd DANAE Doors strongly barr'd, Brass-Tower, with dreadful Watch and Guard Of Dogs, might well have fortify'd From Nightly Rapes un-ey'd; If JOVE and VENUS had not thus Turn'd laughing-stock Acrisius, Nice Jaylour there; set ope' that Hold, The God transform'd to Gold. Gold passes Guarding bands, the Rock, Stout Walls more fierce then Thunders stroke; Breaks through Greek Augur's house, for gain Sunk down with all his Train. Through Bribes that Prince of Macedon Cleft City-gates, proud Kings o're-thrown; Rough Lords, stern Captains of the Sea Insnar'd, become their Prey. Care follows still with Thirst of more Wealth's growing Stock, whence I abhor, As just (MÆCENAS Knight) where-ere, Transcendent Crest to bear. Who more himself doth curb, Deny, From Gods has more; thus naked I Tents of th' ungreedy train pursue; Abandon'd wealthy Crew. More gallant Lord in what I dare Contemn, then held my Barns most fair What's reaped from th' Apulian ground; 'Midst all but Needy found. My smaller Grove, pure dainty Spring, And faithful Corn hopes answering Deceive (more blessed Lot) that Man Styled chief Prince African. Though no Calabrian swarms me glut With Honey's hoards, nor Formian Butt Lodg aged Wine, rich grounds of France By Fleekes my wealth advance; Yet craving Want my Roof doth fly: Nor ask'd I more wouldst thou Deny. Thoughts bounded thus, I'l freelier pay CÆSAR small Dues, then lay Whole Kingdoms else conjoyn'd mine own. Who covet much Want much alone: He's blest whom God with sparing hand Gives what's Enough, well scan'd. To ÆLIUS LAMIAS. Ode XVII. He praises Lamias his Noble Birth, then wishes him to spend the next Day cheerfully. Ælius renown'd, from antient LAMUS sprung, Th' old LAMIÆ; since thence deriv'd, 'tis sung By Fame, with their successive Race; Which truth mindful Records do blaze. From that grand Root thou draw'st Original, Who first did build, possess the Formian Wall Sway'd where stream of Lyris too Marica's grounds doth travel through: Far-ruling King, to Morrow th Eastern Wind Wood-banks will strow with leaves, through Storm unkind; Spread with base Sea-weed the Shore, If th' Augure-bird for Rainy store, Th' old Raven fail not: now build nimble Fire Whilst yet thou mayst, to Morrow Wine acquire; With Porket small thy Genius please, Whilst Servants free'd from Work, at ease. To FAUNUS, Ode XVIII. He intreats the Wood-God, that passing through his Fields, he would be gentle and propitious to him. Faunus, who flying Nimph dost love, O gently pass my Bounds, and move Through th' open Fields; kind leave the Flock, Young growing stock. As tender Kid we do assign Each Year to thee, with plenteous Wine VENUS Comrade; whilst Incence-smoak Th' old Altar choak. Cattle do frisk on Banks each-where, When thy December Nones appear; Feast kept with idle Ox by Swains Through grassy Plains Wolves then may stalk by Lambkins bold, Woods drop their Leaves to thee, new-pol'd; Whilst Bigger beasts in dancing Mirth Hate toylsom Earth. To TELEPHUS. Ode XIX. He blames him jestingly, that, writing antient Histories, he doth neglect Lifes pleasing comforts. How long INACHUS Argive King, E're Athens CODRUS rul'd, who bravely dy'd Thou tell'st; ÆACUS stock dost sing, Those Battails fought near sacred Troy beside. What price large Tun we may acquire O'th' Chios-grape, where washing Bath bestow'd; At whose kind house, and when with Fire Sharp Cold we shall dispel, no mention show'd. Boy, fill cup strait for th' rising Moon, For Midnight fill to th' Murene Augur's praise; Third lastly pour: our Drink let run In three choice Boals, or Nine, convenient ways: The Poet rapt, who Muses loves, Uneven Nine, may thrice three Cups require; Three Graces though (least plenty moves Disorder, broyls) 'bove Three forbid t'aspire; That nak'd and harmless Sister-hood. Now wilder Vein transports, why ceas'd the sound Of Berecynthian Pipe so good? Why hangs the Flute with Harp, to silence bound? O're-thrifty Niggard hands I hate; Fresh Roses spread, let envious Licus hear Our mad-tun'd Noyse with squeamish Mate; For Licus old let neighbour Girl give ear: Spruce, gallant hayr'd, Friend TELEPHUS, Thee, Match to th' bright resplendent Morning-star, Ripe CLOE suits: whilst burneth us GLYCERA's lingring Love, my scornful Fair. To Changed on good grounds. PYRRHA. Ode XX. That she would not draw NEARCHUS from his present Sweet-heart. Pyrrha, dost see what danger nigh? Since Lionesses whelp dost move? Combate ere long thou't gladly fly, Faint Lurcher prove: When she shall Youthful crouds survey, NEARCHUS searching for, renown'd; Bad strife 'twill prove whose lovely Prey He'll then be found. Whilst thou draw'st nimble Shafts to fright, She whets her Teeth more dreadful grown; Thus Palm, chief Arbiter o'th Fight, He stamps upon: Does sport, his Shoulders proud bespread With Locks perfum'd i'th' gentle Air, Like NEREUS once snatch'd GANIMEDE From Ida fair. To his WINE-VESSEL. Ode XXI. He warns it pleasantly, to pour forth its old Wine for Corvinus sake; then praises Wine. Blest Cask, when MANLIUS Consul, born with me; Whether Complaints thou hold, or Mirth more free, Brauls, wild Lust, or gentle Sleep; Since influential Bath dost keep. Be't with what Name it will that thou dost bear Choice Massick Wine, (worthy) Feast-day how ere, Broaching at CORVINE's command; Give way, pour forth thy Juice at hand. Who, though well drench'd in Philosophick strains, Socratick books, not (Rigid) thee disdains: CATO's Virtue oft ('tis told) Did warm it self with Wine, more bold. Thou provest oft that pleasing Rack, to try Gross, dullest Brains; thou into th' Heart dost pry; Wise-men's Cares; their deep design. Lay'st ope unlock'st in merry Wine. Thou Hope with strength bring'st back, through pow'rful Charm, To th' fainting Brest; thou Poor with Horns dost arm; After stoutest thee not fearing King's churlish Brow, Foe's blades appearing. Thee LIBER shall with frolick VENUS too (If present) draw those Graces, slow t'undo Their Girdles ty'd: surviving Light, Till th' Eastern Sun chace Stars to flight. On DIANA. Ode XXII. He consecrates that Pine in his Farm to her, setting forth her Offices. Hills Governess and Maid o'th' Wood, Who Girls when labouring with Brood Dost hear, thrice call'd, reviv'st that Hour; Three formed Pow'r: Claim thou my Pine devote, I shall Each year joyn Blood of Boar withal; Who Meditates best way to strike With Gash oblique. To PHIDILE. Ode XXIII. The Gods are to be worship'd with pure hands, and a good Conscience. If, Country-PHIDILE, rais'd hands, desires Thou lift to Heav'n, when birth o'th' Moon requires; Shalt with Fruits this years encrease, Pork, Frankincence House-Gods appease: Nor shall thy clustred Vines consumed fail Through South-winds rage, nor throng'd Corn-fields bewail Barren blast, sweet Children know Unhealthful time when Pears do grow. Let that on snowy Algidus doth feed 'Mongst Oakes and Holms, or Alban pastures breed, (Beasts devoted long and slain By Vow) the Priestly Axes stain. Thou needst not with various slaughter please Of two-years Sheep thy petty Gods, more ease, When crown'd with Rosemary, some bough From Myrtle frail adorn'd their Brow, If with pure hands to th' Altar thou dost bring, Thy Gods displeas'd no plenteous Offering More shall move (abandon doubt) Then leaping Salt with Corn devout. On greedy RICH MEN. Ode XXIV. Though Wealth thou vauntest more Then th' Ind, untouch'd Arabia's store; Dost gorge with structures vain Th' intire Tyrrhene and Pontick Main; Since Fate the lofti'st Crest With Adamantine Darts hath prest, Nor free'd from Fear thy mind, Nor head from snares of Death untwin'd. More Field-bred Scythians live, Whose Carts their vagrant Houses drive; Firce Getes whose common ground Free Crops affords, discharg'd from Bound: Nor longer Tillage love Then one full year lik Task must prove His Mate whilst he does play, Th' ensuing months keeps Holyday. Mild, harmless Stepdames there With Sons in law more gently bear; Nor Wife through Dowry great Her Spouse o'rerules, kept Letcher neat; Sweet heart: grand Portion be Parents good fame, Maids chastity; Sure-bound not daring slide, Restraint and Death the price beside O he that slaughters harm Would stop, and Civil madness charm, Rome's Father stil'd does love On Statue's brest; let bridled prove Licentiousness o'th' time, Whence fam'd to th' After-age: bad Crime, Vertue alive we hate, Envy, but seek when seiz'd by Fate. But what's complaint, alas, If still th' Offence unpunish'd pass? Law's vain if Lives not grown Reform'd; when parts most Torrid known, Whom burning Heat surrounds, For Boreas frost clad neighbour-grounds, Where crusted Snows do ly, Warn Merchants thence: when Seamen try To master dreadful Seas: Want held so great disgrace by these, They'l tug with any thing; But quit the Virtuous suffering. Or now let's throw in scorn Gems, Gold the Capitol t'adorn (Where vulgar noise doth Crown) Base trash; or neerest-Sea let drown; Since worst of mischiefs breed: If for our Faults peplext indeed, First Elements we must Root forth of base Desires and Lust: Soft tender Minds still train To sharper things: your Generous strain Nor War-bred Horse can ride; Nor dares pursue the Boar, well try'd: For Grecian Tops or proud Of Dice, by Laws not fit allow'd. While th' perjur'd Sire his Friend House-guest doth cheat, to leave i'th' end Gold for th' unworthy Boy; Whose naughty Bags though brood with joy, And fruitful Piles grow more Still something wants, like slender Store. To BACCHUS. Ode XXV. Inspir'd by Bacchus, he will frame new Lyrick Verses of Augustus. Where, BACCHUS, dost thou hurry me By thee Inspir'd? driv'n to what Woods, or Dens? Swift through new spirit Divine, more free: Where sculk'd shall I be heard (bove mortal men's Th' eternal Praise of CÆSAR fam'd Advance to th' Stars, and JOVE'S grand Councel there? I'l great things chant, fresh, unproclaim'd By former mouth; so does from th' Hills appear Rapt BACCHUS Priest with sleepless eye, When Heber views, and shrouded white with Snow North-Thrace, Mount Rhodope on high; Trod still by barbarous feet when Sacred show. How wandring am I pleas'd t'admire Both Rocks and Woods! O who dost Naiades, With thine own Priestess rank, inspire With strength t'oreturn tall Ashes, if they please! No smaller thing nor vulgar ways, Nought Mortal I'l pronounce; sweet, bold design (O BACCHUS) 'tis that God to trace, For Chief, whose brows begirt with branching Vine. To VENUS. Ode XXVI. Now growing Old, he bids farewel both to his Harp and amorous things. I late was Match for Maidens thought, Nor then without some Glory fought; But now mine Arms, deceased Lute (Through war) this Temple's wall shall suit; Which guards fair VENUSSES left side, (Sea born) here hang mine Engines ty'd: Night-walking Torch, fierce Bars and Bow, Threatning to stout clos'd Doors a blow. Thou Goddess of blest Cyprus ground And Memphis-Queen (whence banish'd round Thrace-snows) with high-rais'd scourge (to smart) Once touch proud CHLOE'S hardest heart. To GALATEA Sailing. Ode XXVII. He disswades her from that Danger by Europa's example. Let impious Ones foul-singing Parra's sign In journey lead, pregnant Bitch-Fox combine; Or tawny Wolf from fields of Lanuvine: Or let some winding Snake, doth crossing scar Their Charret-horse, from journey them debar: I doubt not thee, Good my presagings are Before that rain-divining Bird does go To th' standing Fens, that boading-voiced Crow I'l from Sun-rise invoke good Omens show. Maist thou where-ere blest, Galatea, prove, Though gone from hence, live mindful of our Love; Nor left-hand Raven, Pye from going move. But seest? what stormy Noise ORION sends, Nigh-set? what th' Adrian Port grown black portends. I know, how clear Iapix Wind offends. Let Wives of Foes those secret Workings feel Of rising Kya, Seas dark, enchafed still; Whilst batter'd Banks doe seem to tremble, Reel. Thus bold EUROPA trusts her Snowy side To th' false enamour'd Bull, pale-cheek'd did ride, When Seas with Whales and bull's false arts descry'd. Whom, choosing Flow'rs i'th' field the Nimphs to crown As challeng'd debt, by Night (when clearer grown) She back'd, nought viewing but Stars and Waves alone. Return'd to Crete, of hundred Cities Fame, She frantick cry'd; O Fathers slighted Name, And Daughters piety! quench'd Vertue's flame! Whither now brought? One Death's too small to dye For Virgin's Crime; bad fact with waking eye Dost mourn, deplore? or cheats fond Phantasie? Elizian dream? else pure, unstain'd; as though 'Twere finer on smooth vastest Waves to goe, Then crop fresh Flow'rs in painted Meads below. O would some Man that vilest Beast from Fate Yield to my Rage, some sharp edg'd Sword should bait That Bull, and rend his Horns belov'd of late. Past shame, my Fathers houshold-gods I fly, Past shame yet live; some gentler Deity (If hears) 'mongst Lions wandring let me die. Ere Leanness foul doth starving wast, abuse My yet plump Cheeks, and drink their youthful Juice, Whilst tender Prey, and fair let Tigers bruise. EUROPA loath'd! thy Father still does check, Unseen; why dy'st thou not? Go stretch thy Neck On yonder Ash, thy Girdle waits at beck. Or would sharp Rocks delight, Death's swifter kind? Go, cast thee down to th' whirling stormy Wind; Unless some Handmaids Task could please thy Mind; A Princess spin, serve barbarous Mistress so; Foul Strumpet turn'd. VENUS o're-heard her Woe, And laugh'd, her Boy set by with unbent Bow. Till cloy'd with Mirth enough, said Fy; in jeer; Leave these fond Brauls, that loathed Bull (where-ere) Shall strait present his Horns for you to tear. Know'st not th' art Wife to strongest JOVE? for shame Quit Sobs, Complaints, to thy grand Fortune frame; The World's first part proves called by thy Name. To LYDE. XXVIII. He perswades her to spend Neptune's Festival more chearfully. Reserved choice Cæcubian wine, Stout LYDE, draw, what fitter for this Hour? For NEPTUNE'S Festival-design? Thy Wisdome strong too serious thoughts ore-power. The Noon thou seest still faster run, And yet as though swift Day did pausing stand Dost spare to move that resting Tun, Undrunk since Consul BIBULUS did command. NEPTUNE with pure Sea-Nymphs, by course, Green-hair'd Nereides I'l singing vaunt: Latona, her who darts with force, Swift DIAN thou to th' crooked Harp shalt chant: VENUS (for cloze) whom Cnidus-town, Clear Cyclades prefer; who Paphos-Isle, View'd oft with yoaked Swans, doth crown: Night too shall have her solemn Song fit stile. To MÆCENAS. Ode XXIX. He invites him to a merry Supper, publick Cares omitted. Mæcenas, branch from Tyrrhene Kings inroll'd; Wine-cask unstir'd, which milder Juice does hold, We reserved have long time For thee, with Roses flow'r in prime: Choice Unguent, last, thy fragrant Locks to dew: Come, stay not then; don't always fixed view Tibur moist, with Æsul field Nor Tel'gon Mounts who Father kill'd: But plenty leave, from cloying store withdraw, Thy lofty'st Tower which neighbouring Clouds do aw; Cease t'admire the smoaky womb, Grand wealth and Noise of happy Rome. Some times, I pray: Change oft the Rich doth please; And cleanly, short Repasts have smooth'd to these Troubled brows in poor men's Cells, No Arras where nor Purple dwells. Now Summer-star, that bright-ey'd Cepheus shows His hidden Fire, and raging Porcion grows; Furious Lion; droughty days The Sun enkindleth through new Rays. Now Pastor faint with lazy Flock doth pry For cooling streams, Silvanus-walks more nigh; Thick frequent; Banks calmed be And hush'd, from windy Vagrants free. Thou plod'st on great Affairs, the City how To manage, rule; what Seres (pensive) now, Dost fear, or Bactrians 'gainst the State, Rough Tanais Neighbours machinate. Wise God in darkest Night ore-masked hides Future events, that busy Man derides, Who beyond his lawful Sphere Doth stray, perplext: Salve dangers near; Present compose, as right: Things future have Their River's course, which now with peaceful Wave Dance in their Channel, smoothly glide To th' western Sea; and then through pride Sturdy become, big-swoln; Rocks, shatter'd Stones, Torn Houses, Trees, Sheep, Heards roul down at once; (Hills and Woods conjoyn'd i'th' Noise) Show'rs vexing them. He self enjoys, And chearful lives, that using time can say, Through tasted present Goods, I've liv'd this Day: To morrow let Heaven's Father bright With sullen Clouds the Pole benight. Or guild with purer Beams; what Joys are past, And gone behind he will not vainly blast, Nor undoe call back by pow'r, What's snatch'd from hence by the flying Hour. Fortune, which seems in cruel work to glory, For haughty Games (as 'twere) found peremptory; Honours throws with doubtful mind; Now good to me, then t'others Kind: I praise her while she stays, but if she shake Her swift-plum'd Wings, I back resign, forsake What she gave; in Virtue I Me shroud, hug honest Poverty. I like not Gods with dismal Pray'rs t'implore, And bargain'd Vows, when my torn Mast does roar Through Southern wind, left Cyprus-goods, Or Tyre enrich the greedy Floods: Which ventur'd ere, stout Me some petty Gale, (With gentle Twins) convoy'd in Vessel frail, Double-oar'd shall safe command Through rough Ægean storms to land. To the Muse MELPOMENE. Ode XXX. Horace hopes through his writing Lyrick Verse he hath gain'd eternal Glory. I've wrought a Monument more strong then Brass, Which doth the Towry Pyramid surpass, For Regal height; which neither eating Storm, Nor North-winds feeble rage shall hurt, deform, Nor countless years. I will not wholy die, Though Ages rot; but my large part shall fly The churlish Hearse, in after praise and Friends Surviving still: so long as Priest ascends The Capitol with Maid to silence fram'd: I meaner born yet great will be proclaim'd; What way rough Aufidus doth wandring Roar; Or DAUNUS (poor in streams) men ruled ore: The first that Grecian Verse to Roman art, Numbers deriv'd: then take thy Glories part, MELPOMENE, from hence, and freely now With Delphick Laurel crown thy Poets Brow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HORACE HIS FOURTH BOOK OF ODES. To C. ASINIUS POLLIO. Ode I. Horace is now of that Age, that he should be averse to Amorous things, and lighter Poems. Dost VENUS move Love-wars again, Unpractis'd long? excuse me now, my Strength Is not now such as when did raign Kind-hearted CYNERA: forbear at length, Cruel Mother oft of sweet desires; Taught me to bend, (Ag'd fifty years, or more) To th' wanton Task. Go where thy fires Fond Youngsters beg, with soothing Prayers implore; Thou seasonabler Friend shall Feast, Swift drawn by joyned Swans, within the Roof Of PAULUS MAXIMUS as Guest; If Livor seek'st compos'd for Flames of proof; This Noble-rank'd and comely fac'd, Well-spoken too for sad Delinquents found, With hundred Arts Youth neatly grac'd, Thy warlike Ensigns wide shall bear, renown'd: Whose powerful Smiles win more respect, Then largest Guifts from common Rivals doe, This Marble Statue shall erect For thee near Alban Lakes, rich Covering too; There bounteous Frankincense thy smell Shall banquet oft, thy curious Ears delight Choice verse to th' Harp conjoyned well; Pipe Berecinthian too shall Flutes invite: There Youth with tender Girls thy power, Even and Morn, shall dancing celebrate; Thrice beating still the Earth that hour With their white feet, like Mars his Priests instate. Me Womankind nor pleases now, Nor credulous hope of Faithful answering Love, Mutual flames; nor girded Brow With Odorous Flow'rs, nor strifes in Wine to prove. [The rest on good grounds omitted.] To JULIUS ANTONIUS. Ode II. He much advanceth Pindar's height, Greek Stile; then, praises Augustus. Who PINDAR'S Stile to reach doth aim, Trusts waxen Wings, which chanc'd to please Th' Icarian Youth, and drown'd may name The glassy Seas. Like flood from lofty Cliffs, whom showr's Have overswell'd its ancient Bound, Boyls PINDAR high, large Language pours From Mouth profound. Worthy'st to be with Laurel grac'd, When shows in Dithyrambicks bold Uulgar stile; Verse freely pac'd, By none controull'd. When chanteth Gods, or mighty Kings Their seed, by whom (most just) destroy'd Centaurs Chimæra's dreadfull stings, Which flames did void. Or those, th' Elean Palm brought home, Celestial stil'd (the Horse-combatant, Or foot) 'bove hundred Statues dumb, Tongu'd verse doth grant. Snatch'd Youth from weeping Bride does mourn By fates, whose Valour, golden parts, 'Mongst Stars enroll'd; from Grave deaths scorn Frees his Deserts. Much Gale this sweet Dyrræan Swan, To th' cloudy Coast when oft aspires, Doth raise like Bee Calabrian With low Desires. Which through the Wood, moist Tibur-bank Sweet Thyme doth search with toilsome Wing: Laborious strains of smaller Rank My Muse doth sing. Thou with grand Harp, enlarged Verse Shalt CÆSAR chant; when drags in Pride Through sacred Mount the Germans fierce, Palm-beautifi'd. Then whom kind Gods to th' Earth have given Nought greater, better Things; nor none Will give, though times returned even To th' Golden one. Thou Festivals and publick Sports Shalt chant, since to his Royal home Stout CÆSAR obtain'd; when freed Law-courts From wrangling, dumb: Large part (what worthy ought) then bring: My Mouth shall joyn, and blisful I, O fairest day! extoll'd, shall sing; Great CÆSAR nigh. Thou marching first, with general Voice, Grand Triumph, O! grand Triumph, we Shall round proclaim; burn Incence choice To th' Gods, most free. Thou shalt ten Bulls prepare, ten Cows; Me weaned Calf acquits the spoil From Dam, growing big to serve my Vows On fruitful Soil: Whose younger Front those fiery horns O'th' Moon presents, when three days old; White Snowy mark his Brow adorns, The rest like Gold. To MELPOMENE. Ode III. Horace is born a Poet, by that Art gaining immortal glory. Whom thou, Melpomene, with smile When born behold'st, nor big through Champion-stile, Laborious Wrastling sport shall blaze; Nor Conqueror swift joyned Horse for Race In Grecian Chariot shall bear: Nor valour make in th' Capital appear Command chief, with Laurel crown'd; For taming Kings proud, swelling Threats renown'd: Such grand exploits of Warlike toil: But purling Streams which flow through Tibur Soil, And Woods green Locks delightful spread Through Lyrick-verse enoble shall that Head. Rome's Youth, whom States as Queen admire, Have honour'd me 'mongst that beloved Quire Of Poets to advance enroll'd: Freed now from Envious tooth, more uncontroull'd. O thou Pierian, whose art Doth sweetest sound to th' golden Harp impart; Who canst to silent Fish, with ease, Give dying Swans harmonious Tunes, if please; 'Tis thy indulgent Guift alone, That by each pointing Finger I am shown Well-skill'd in Roman Harp divine; That I do breath and Please (if please) is Thine To the CITY of ROME, Ode IV. Touching the good Parts of Drusus, and his training up under Augustus. Such as that fierce and Thunder-bearing Bird, Whom JOVE the King of Gods gave empire high Or'e wandring Foul since (Faith unstir'd) Snatch'd Gold-hair'd GANIMEDE to Sky; Whom Youth long since with Fathers vigorous strain Thrust forth the Nest, not knowing hardy Toil, And vernal Winds (clear'd stormy rain) Did teach th' unused ways of spoil; Less Bold before; strait 'mongst the fleeced Flocks Strong lively force with Beak hostile doth send; Dragons though like sturdy Rocks, Sharp fight and wisht-for Prey his end: Or such as wild-bred Goat intentive even On pasture fair, beholds the Lyons whelp, From's yellow Mothers dug late driven; Food for new Teeth, dispairing help: Such was beheld DRUSUS, when waged war Under their Alps, by Rhetians, Vandelicks, Amazonian Axes rare In their right hand that us'd to fix: Though whence deriv'd to search I shall forbear (Nor can all things be found) those armed Bands (Far victorious) scatter'd were By youthful Heads design, commands, And felt what native Wit more noble Strain, Well-tutor'd in aspiring Cells could doe And what paternal CÆSAR'S brain Could work in these young NERO'S too. Stout Men from stout and good descend, proceed; In Bullocks, Horse Sire's vertue sparks do prove: Nor will conquering Eagles breed The softly plum'd, unwarlike Dove. Fit Counsel though does inbred Force advance; Brests stronger prove Wise nurturing when imbrace; And where Manners fail (sad chance) Bad acts their well-born Strains disgrace. What thou great Rome to th' NERO'S ow'st unquell'd. Witness Metaurus-stream, where sunk by Fate Asdrubal; that day expell'd Dark fogs from our Italian state: Which day first smil'd in plenteous Fruits and Corn, Since that dire Hannibal through Towns did ride (As the slain through Torches born) Pass'd through Sicilian Seas with pride. That conquest gor, Rome's youth hath flourish'd grown By prosperous Toils; and Temples, much defac'd By th' wicked Penian croud, their own Right Gods enjoy securely plac'd. And thus, at length spoke HANNIBAL'S grand heat; Devouring Wolves, we Stags fond prey indeed Do hunt, pursue, whose force to cheat, Escape might splendid Triumph breed. That Nation which, grown strong from burned Troy, Their tossed Gods through Tuscan Seas high-wrought, Children, Grandsires too (with joy) To th' loath'd Ausonian Towns hath brought. Like barbed Oak by sturdy Axes shorn, Whose branches lopt in fruitful Algidus, Wealth from slaughters, Loss hath born; From wounding Sword more vigorous. Not Hydra more, when Body slash'd, renew'd Firm Combatant to th' grief of HERCULES; Nor Thebes Colchos-monster view'd More strange, whose Pair did dead encrease. Drown him i'th' Deep he'l stronger, fairer rise; Grapple with him, with glory he'l orecome His conqueror; set Battles tries, For Wives fond Table-talk at home. I now no more proud Messengers shall send To Carthage of our Acts, Hope dead, 'tis dead; With fortune of our Name in th' end, Since soul of ASDRUBAL is fled. What cannot do those Claudian hands, fulfil? Whom JOVE does guard with most indulgent care; Whom sound martial wisdom-still Bears through th' accutest Points of War. To AGUSTUS. Ode V. That he would at length return to Rome. O spring, from milder Gods best Guardian To th' Roman race, th' art now too long away, Though promis'd quick Dispatch to th' reverend train Of Senators; return, we pray. Restore, dear chief Light to thy Country-Skies, For when beheld those Spring-like looks of thine, More grateful goes the Day in peoples eyes; And Suns more gloriously do shine. As Mother youthful Son, whom envious blast Of Northern Wind beyond Carpathian Seas (Now lingring more then yearly term orepast) Detains from sweetest Home and ease; With Vows importunes oft, pray'rs, Omens skill; Nor turns her Visage from the crooked Shore: So, touch'd with loyal Flames, his Country still Does CÆSAR mourning seek, implore. Since th' Ox does then rove safely Pasture-ground, CERES does nourish Fields, abundant Corn; Ships fly through quiet Seas, and Faith is found To fear all blame, much less forsworn. The honest house with Lust not stain'd, debas'd; Good Julian Laws have purg'd those fouler Crimes: Child-births, since like to th' Fathers more are prais'd; Just Doom doth follow Guilt betimes. Who Parthian does, cold frozen Scythian fear? Or who that Brood which horrid Germany Brings forth great CÆSAR safe? who values e're Spain's broils, hostility? Each couched views the Day from his own Hills, To th' widow'd Elm whilst marries there the Vine; Thence to's Repast, where second Table fills Devote to thee, like Pow'r divine. Thee with much pray'r, and thee with Wine implores, Pour'd forth diffus'd; thy Deity does bless Mongst houshold Gods, as thankful Greece adores Great CASTOR, valiant HERCULES. Long, worthi'st Chief, may Festivals be given By thee to Rome, i'th' Morning be that spread, When we are dry; when moist with drink i'th' Even; And Sol through th' Ocean gone to Bed. To APOLLO and DIANA, a Secular Poem. Ode VI. God, whom proud NIOBE'S large Race Tongues scourge did feel, and TITIUS, base For lust; ACHILLES too, that high Troy conquer'd nigh: Great'st man of Arms but small to thee, Sea-Goddess Son though fam'd to be; Which could with Spears most dreadful powr's Shake Trojan Tow'rs: Like Pine with wounding Ax down cast, Or Cypres torn by Eastern blast, He prostrate fell, Neck, shoulders thrust In Trojan dust He'd not through wooden Horse, bely'd Guift to Minerva, thence deride Ill-feasting Trojans, PRIAM'S Court 'Midst Dances, sport: But cruel would with open Brands Yet speechless Babes in Swadling-bands Have burnt, or lurking in the Womb, Felt Mothers doom: Had not that Father o'th' Gods through thine, And lovely VENUS suit, Design, Stor'd for ÆNEAS happier Fate; Rome's Walls and State. Prime-voic'd Thalia's Tutor rare, Drenching in Zanthus stream thy hair, Smooth PHÆBUS shown with grace, defend Song Latin-pen'd. PHÆBUS inspires my Mind, doth th' art Of Verse and Poets name impart; Mixt Virgins chief, and Youth's that bud From noble blood, By th' Delian Goddess crown'd whose Bow Wild Beasts inthralls and nimble Row, Learn well my Saphick feet: Harps touch Regard as much: Chanting, when fit, Latona's son, With Nights increasing Lamp, the Moon; Prospering Fruits, and swiftest found, Months chasing round. Thou Maid, when grown a Wife, wilt say, Tuneful to th' Gods on Feasting day I HORACE his well-chanted Verse Did learn'd rehearse. To MANLIUS TORQUATUS. Ode VII. All things change in time, therefore he should live chearfully. The Snows are fled; now Grass by fields is worn; Leaf-dress doth Trees adorn. Earth changes proves and Floods, from wilder race Recall'd their Chancels trace. AGLAIA dares now nak'd with Sisters twain, And Nymphs dance round the Plain. The Year forbids thee hope perpetual stay; And th' Hour that whirls the Day: Zeph'rus last cold allays; Summer the spring Outwears, that perishing; Then luscious Autumn pours her Fruits, and then Dull Winter shews agen. Yet nimble Moons their wained Loss repair, But we when sunk, where are ÆNEAS good, rich Tullus, Ancus thrust, Prove empty shades and dust. Who knows if Gods will joyn to this days Score To Morrow's hours in store? What now thou giv'st, through franker Mind dost use, Some greedy Heirs but loose. When th' art once dead, and MINOS Judg hath pass'd Thy sentence clear, at last. Nor Birth, TORQUATUS, high, nor eloquence, Vertue shall free thee thence: Not DIAN can Hippolitus revive (Chast Youth) from dark reprieve: Nor THESEUS spoil Lethæan bond, which does Hold dear Perithous. To CENSORINUS. Ode VIII. Nothing can make Men immortal, more then Poets Verses. I should give Silver Bouls, lov'd CENSORINE, Statues of Brass to my Comrades, as free, Or rich three-footed Tables, present fine For Grecian Chiefs; nor guifts of mean Degree Should's thou enjoy; if wealthy in things of Art Which SCOPAS or PARRASIUS did invent; On Marble This, in colours That his part Most lively play'd, Man, God could represent: But I have no such pow'r, nor dost thou want In mind, or House those daintier Rarities: Verses thou lov'st, and we can Verses chant, Frankly bestow; Guifts valuable these: Not Marble carv'd with publick titles, praise, By which Life-breath does seem restor'd withal To Worthies dead; nor timerous flights so base, Proud threats repell'd of churlish HANNIBAL, Nor burning Tops of perjur'd Carthage Tow'rs, More brightly show'd his Worth, who manful gain'd New-added name from Africk's conquer'd pow'rs, Then ENNIUS, that Calabrian Muse well-strain'd. Nor could'st thou reap Reward, where Papers dumb To thy grand Acts, what would of ROMULUS, That Youth by MARS and ILIA become, Did envious Silence shroud his Praise from us? Æacus snatcht from Stygian streams and fate Wits force, regard, from Poets powerful high; To th' Islands wealthy term'd does consecrate: Praise-worthy men stout Mase forbids to Dye. Muse does advance to Heaven; Thus, honour'd Guest Herc'les inroll'd at JOVE'S desired board: Castor and Pollux stars (with Godhead blest) Tost Ships from gulfy Depths have oft restor'd: BACCHUS, whose brows with green Vine-branch are crown'd, Hears Poets pray'rs; their Friends doth make renown'd. To LOLLIUS. Ode IX. His Writings shall never perish; Virtue is smother'd, lost without the help of Poems: he will chant the praise of LOLLIUS. Lest thou shouldst think those Words as vanish'd, gone, Which I (born near far-sounding Aufidus) Speak by Arts of late unknown. With strings to be combined thus; Although first Rank Mæonian HOMER have, Yet not hid PINDAR SIMONIDES; Sharp ALCÆUS Songs, nor grave Which warlike Stesichor did please: Nor what long since ANACREON lightly plai'd Hath Time devour'd ought, still breaths the Love Of Sapho, that Æolian Maid, Whose fires on strings do chanted prove. Not only HELLEN'S heart inflam'd ('tis told) With spruce-comb'd Locks of fine Adulterer, Cloaths admir'd orelaid with Gold, Kings garb, resplendent Train from far. Nor TEUCER from Cidonian Bow let fly Fist Archer-shafts, nor Troy besieg'd was known But once; Idomeneus high Nor Stenelus fought wars alone For Muses Song: not HECTOR bravely stout, Nor stern Deiphobus did first endure Doleful wounds for Sons (no doubt) Belov'd and Wives most chastly pure. Many men breath'd ere Agamemnon's Age; That now lye smother'd, lost, and undeplor'd In longest Night, both Valiant, Sage; Since reverend Poet want, record. Virtue conceal'd not differs much from scorn'd, Well-bury'd Sloath; my Papers shall not thee Leave in silence unadorn'd, Nor those thy Labours blasted be, Without Revenge, by black Oblivion. Best LOLLIUS, thou bear'st most prudent Mina For Affairs, and even known, When times of prosperous, Doubtful kind. Scourge to false Avarice, reserv'd, and clear From thirst of Coin, which all does draw, controll: Nor provest Consul for one year, But oft, as faithful Judg, thy Soul Hath honest things advanc'd 'bove gainful, base; And lofty scorn'd Bribes from injurious Hands Of wrongful men, bold Arms displays Unmov'd through their opposing Bands. Thou shalt not truly stile Blessed that Man Who much enjoys; more rightly Name of blest Vaunteth he, who wisely can Use guifts o'th' Gods with sober Brest: As skillful knows hard Want withal t'endure; Who worse then death doth fear flagitious Crime: That Man dares to perish sure For his lov'd Friends and Country-clime. Ode X. Omitted on good grounds. To PHILLIS. Ode XI. He invites her to a Banquet in April, being the Birth-day of MÆCENAS. View, PHILLIS, cask of Alban Wine, Near ten years Old; th' Orchard beneath With Smallage, Ivy store does shine, Fit Crowns to wreath; From whence thy Self dost Beams reflect: My House with Silver smiles, Lamb's gore Th' Altar desires, with Vervin deckt Till sprinkled o're. Each hand assists, both here and there Youths, Maidens, joyn'd industrious run, Whilst rolling flames dark Smoak do bear, Like Clouds to th' Sun. Joy's cause let this be mentioned, Th' Ides thou must celebrate, that day Guts April's half, which Month Sea-bred VENUS doth sway. Justly observ'd, ev'n as mine Own Birth-day, with hallow'd Reverence, His years since my MÆCENAS known To count from thence. TELEPHUS, whom thou seek'st in vain, (Beyond thy rank) Rich wealthy Lass, Blith, wanton too, with grateful Chain Inthralled has. Burnt PHAETON proud hopes affright; Wing'd Pegasus (sad tale to th' wise) BELLEROPHON, that earth-born Knight, Ill bare to Skys. That, comely things pursu'd, and those Too high thought Crime renounc'd may prove, (Unequal Match) come then thou close Of all my Love: For from this time none other She Shall warm my Heart, learn Verse to sing With powerful Voice, then scatter'd be Black Cares, take flight. To VIRGIL. Ode XII. He sets forth the Spring, and invites Virgil upon a condition to a Banquet. Now Western Winds more gently stretch the Sayls, Comrades o'th' Spring, with softer-breathed Gales; Fields not Ice-stiff, nor Rivers murmuring show, Big-swell'd with Winter's Snow. That hapless Bird, which ITIS Mourns, doth frame Her Swallows nest; that Brand, th' eternal shame Of CECROP's house, who barbarous Lust so ill Reveng'd as Babe to kill. The Shepherd's verse on tender grass do sing To th' warbling Pipe, and welcome so the Spring; Pleasing that God whom Flocks, Arcadia's sight, Those gloomy Hills delight. Warm Season, VIRGIL, now the thirst doth Fire. But Wine Calene thy Fancy, if shall desire, Thou (lov'd by th' Noblest Youths) mayst bargain make, For Nard's sweet Unguent take: Thy little Box draws forth for thee a Tun, Lodg'd now beneath Sulpitius Vaults from Sun; Pow'rful new Hopes t'infuse, and from thy Brest Wash bitter Cares, unrest. Such Joys if wouldst obtain more nimbly hast With th' od'rous Price; I'l not my Liquor wast, Nor drench thee in my Cups free-cost, like those Where plenteous House o're-flows: Shew then delays, with Lucre's fond desires. And mindful soon of those black Funeral Fires. Short Folly mix with Counsel grave; 'tis sweet To fool, place season fit. To LYCE. Ode XIII. He insults over her, that growing Old, Young-men do scorn, despise her. Gods (LYCE) at length, kind Gods have heard, My Vows, th' art now grown Old and mar'd: Yet, alas! wouldst fain seem Fair, Canst Toy, out-drink thy share. With trembling Notes in Wine dost prove Some Youths ore-cold Desires to move; He fresh CHIA's Voice doth seek; Lean's on her Spring-like Cheek. But flyes past juiceless Oaks in scorn, So foul thy rotten Teeth (forlorn) Make thee, wrinkled Face and Head Where Snow's discovered. Nor can bright Purples, glistering Stones Fetch back past glorious years, which once Time hath shut with nimbler-hand, In known Record to stand. Where's now that Venus, colour gone, That active Grace? what thing, what one Of her which breath'd forth Loves, whose Eyes Did me from Self surprize: Blest Form next CYNERA's, renown'd, Wore moving'st Arts; but short Life-bound Fates set forth to her, though (shame) Will LYCE keep chang'd Dame, Till as the Raven monstrous Old, That fervent Youth may Noses hold; Nor without much Laughter see Fire-brand cinders turn'd in thee. To AUGUSTUS. Ode XIV. The Roman Senate could not give Augustus Honours equal to his Virtues. What care of Senate-Lords or people may With fullest Honours, guifts (AUGUSTUS high) Through Statues styles, Historick way Thy Virtues grant eternity: O thou of Princes great'st, where-ere the Sun Enlightens habitable Ground from far; Whom rough Vindelicks, that shun Rome's laws, have learn'd what thou in War Canst stoutly atchive; for by thy conquering Bands Genauni, Brenni swift (keen-temper'd Race) DRUSUS oft through thy commands Ore-turn'd, and did their Forts deface: Which shew'd on dreadful Alps their threatning Tow'rs: Soon after too those Rhætians (fiercely fam'd) Th' elder NERO through thy pow'rs Prosperous guidance bravely tam'd. Most worthy to behold in Martial strife, How he did tire with slaughtering chase their Brests (To Death devout 'bove thralled Life) Like southern Wind whose blasts infests The sturdy, rolling waves, Pleideian train Breaking through clouds: such active he with speed To vex arm'd Troops, through-Fire to strain Advance with his incensed steed. So hurries on bull-form'd Aufidus Which washeth CAUNUS Realm, th' Apulian bounds; And raging fearful Deluge thus Designs to th' well manured grounds; As CLAUDIUS force extream did ruine, spoil Those iron-fenced Troops Barbarian, (Formost, last measur'd, strow'd the Soil) Bright Conqueror scarce lost a man: Thou sending armed pow'rs, firm Counsels thou, Propitious Gods; for on that self same day Great havens, Court with humble Brow Set ope by Alexandria: Not fifteen years, Fortune indulgent thus Did give by CLAUDIUS war most happy Cloze; Wisht-for Honour, praise assign'd To thee, shewn vengeance on thy Foes. Thee stout Cantabria till now untam'd, Mede, Judian both, thee Scythians wanting home Admire; O thou defence proclaim'd To Italy, worlds Empress Rome. Thee Nilus which conceals his Fountain-heads, And Ister-stream, that rapaid Tigris thee, With whale-stor'd Main which murmur spreads On farthest shores of Britany. Thee land of France, which death-contemners prove, Laborious Spain does fear, obey by Fate; Germans thee (though slaughters love) Their Arms laid by do venerate. Ode XV. The praises of AUGUSTUS. Me when inclin'd to sing of Wars, the Fame Of Cities won with Harp, PHÆBUS did blame; With smaller Sayls least try'd profound Ocean Tyrrhene: CÆSAR renown'd; Thy time hath Fruits to Fields, most plenteous hoard, And Ensigns lost to our great JOVE restor'd, From proud-deck'd Parthian Posts of late: Shut also JANUS warlike Gate. Now freed from Broyls compos'd, right Orders dress; And curb'd with Bit wandring Licentiousness Guilt scoured off by Laws, well fill'd Call'd back Rome's antient Arts exil'd: By which the Latine name, th' Italick flow'r Of strength first grew; whose vast Imperial pow'r, Fame to th' Sun's uprising spread From's Western fall, Hesperian bed. Whilst CÆSAR governs things, no Civil force, Mad Fury shall soft Quiet harm, Divorce; Rage which forges Swords, o'rethrows All League, turns Citty-friends to Foes. Not those which drink Danubius-stream, so fair, Shall break the Julian Laws, not Getes shall dare; Seres, faithless Persian Crew, Nor those which Tanais-banks do view. Whilst we on holy Eves each Festival, 'Midst chearful BACCHUS guifts, our Matrons all, Boys invoking first (as right) The Gods, our Fathers us'd delight, With Lydian Pipes conjoyned Verse shall sing; Those Captains bravely dead, Rome honouring; Troy withal, ANCHISES name, And VENUS Off-spring chant, proclaim.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HORACE HIS BOOK EPODON. To MÆCENAS, Epod. I. Horace will go with Mæcenas to the Actiack War against M. Anthony. Thou wilt in Liburn Ships, MÆCENAS Friend, Against tall floating Castles go Of Anthony, each danger though With ventrous CÆSAR shar'd; Partner to th' end: But what of us? t'whom Life may pleasant be Thou still safe, else Burdensome: Should we desire Court-ease at home, Not lov'd at all without enjoying Thee? Though cannot bear War's labour, toyl as does More hardy Soul, we will endure; The steps through Alpine Hills (be sure) Shall trace, inhospitable Caucasus: Yea follow thee to th' utmost Western bound With mind untir'd: If thou dost ask, How we should ease thy Labour task. Thorough our own; not strong, unwarlike found; Comrade with thee less proves our Jealous Fear: Th' Heart's in Absence chiefly stung, Like Bird o're her unfeather'd Young: Which most suspects smooth gliding Serpents there When left alone; not that her Presence may With champion-power Defend them ought: This and all Wars shall still be fought. With chearfullness, view'd thine indulgent Ray. Not that my Ploughs, where more yoak'd Bullocks are, Should still more in Number shine; Nor Herds Calabrian fields resign For Lucan's fresh, ere felt Dog's burning star; Nor that my white, tall seated Tuscan Town Should reach remote Circean Tow'rs: Enough and more thy bounteous show'rs My Chests enriched have, too much may Drown: Scarce shall I hoard for greedy Chremes end, To shroud in Earth, nor as loose Heir to spend. EPOD. II. He names one Alphius (some Roman Usurer) who for a fit, much praised the Country-life, prepar'd for that; though soon fell to his City-Trade again. Alphius, That man is Blest, who far from City cares, Like those o'th' ancient Age of Gold, His Father's grounds Ploughs with his Oxen pairs; Free'd from all Use for Debts inroll'd Nor Souldier rouz'd with dreadful Trumpets noise, Nor Sea-man scar'd with angry Wave; Shunning Law courts, and Thresholds proud, the Voice Support of powerful Rich to crave. Does therefore Poplars tall to th' well grown Vine In Marriage link, for friendly Breed, And Lops those barren Sprouts which idly twine, That happier Off-spring may succeed: Or else retir'd to gloomy Vale, from far His lowing wandring Heard beholds. Sweet Honey's wealth lays up in purest Jar; Or barbs his weakly Sheep from Folds: But Autumn shewing her crown'd Head, that wears Mild Apples, various fruitful Dress, How joyeth he? strait crops his planted Pears: Then Grape, which Purple challenges. What should he give thee PRIAPUS? what thee, SILVANUS? Guardian-Gods for all. Sometimes he likes th' old Elderus Canopy, Then couch'd on weaved Grass to fall; Whilst chanting Birds from Shades his ear rejoyce; And Brooks from lofty Banks, with those Small streaming Founts, yield gentle Murmurs noise, Sweet Lullabies for soft Repose: But Winter when arriv'd, when thundring JOVE Commandeth Show'rs, with Snows and Frost, Keen-tusked Boars, with Dogs, he drives to Rove, Till in confronting Toyls be tost: Or smaller Nets on slender props he tyes, Deceit to catch the greedy Thrush; The wandring Crane's his Gin's triumphant Prize, And fearful Hare from sculking Bush. Who not 'mongst these forgets those pining Cares, Mischiefs, tormenting Racks of Love? But if some honest Dame to th' House-affairs (Sweet Children's help) conjoyned prove, Such as the Sabine-Wife, or Sun-burnt Spouse Of sturdy-back'd Apulian, They build with Wood th' Hearths Consecrated brows, When coming home her tir'd Good-man: The joyful Beasts shut up in hurdle Stalls, For Milk their swelling Uddern's dry'd; And this year's Wine from cleanly Cask that falls, With home-bred Food to th' Board apply'd. Not me should more those Lucrine Cockles brave, Nor Turbot, Guilt-heads choice, delight (If thundring Winter on the Eastern Wave Should some to th' Western Seas affright) Nor th' Africk Fowl descend into my Panch More pleas'd, th' Ionick Quail (not these) Then Olive choice, cull'd from the fattest Branch Of prime selected Olive Trees; Or Mallows good for Folks infirm, or that Field-loving herb, green Sorrel call'd: Or Lamb which on Feast Terminal does wait; Snatch'd Kid from Wolvish jaws, enthrall'd. 'Midst this Repast how pleasant glance to view The well-fed Sheep returning home: Behold, when Plough-shares turn'd, those Oxen crew With heavy drawing Necks to come: Slaves plac'd; the Rich man's toyling Bees, as 'twere: While shining round fresh Houshold-Gods. This when had spoke ALPHIUS the Usurer; As bent for Rustick life by odds, He call'd in all his Gold this Month with pain, Though seeks next Month to lend it forth again. To MÆCENAS. Epod. III. Having eaten Garlick with Mæcenas he doth much inveigh against it. Who from this time with Impious hand (as Curse) His aged Father's Neck shall break, Let Garlick eat for Doom, then Hemlock worse; Who Reapers strongest Guts can speak? How flames this Poyson through my Bowels round? Am I deceiv'd with Vipers blood, Well stew'd with Herbs? or did some Witch compound, CANIDIA dress the spiteful Food? MEDEA. since beyond each Argonaut JASON their lovely chief admir'd, When Yoaks unknown for furious Bulls he brought, Nointed with this his Limbs infir'd. Roabs daub'd with this, reveng'd o'th' burned Whore His Wife, on Dragon-bird she fled. Nere in Dog-days th' Apulians droughty shore Such fume from scorching Stars o'respread; Nor flam'd more hot that Guift which HERCULES, Stout Champion, on his Shoulders bare. But if thy self, MÆCENAS, Wag, shalt please To use such Food, be this my Pray'r. May thy Belov'd still to thy Kiss oppose Her Hand, and shrink to th' Beds far-side, for close. To VOLETIUS MENA, the Freed-man of POMPEY the Great. Epod. IV. What loathing 'twixt the Wolf and Lamb is born, By nature's bred 'twixt thee and me; Whose parched side with Spanish whipcord worn, And Shanks through Fetters brawny be. Though proud thou walk'st through Golden sums each day, Yet Fortune changes not the kind; See'st not, whilst thou dost tread the Sacred way With Gown where full six Ells confin'd, How looks doth Dart on thee with frank Disdain Each Passenger? what Jeers that hour? This Fellow lash'd, till made the Beadle ore-strain, With whips by Triumviral power, Some thousand acres Falern Soyl doth plough, With Foot-cloath th' Appian Road he wears. Brave Roman Knight, 'mongst foremost seated now; Whilst OTHO's Law contemn'd appears. Wherefore such store of ponderous Ships and vast, Where brasen-beaked Fronts are shown, 'Gainst Pirats sent? that Servile rout, in hast? This Slave of Souldiers Tribune grown. Epod. V. Upon the Witch CANIDIA. He feigns in Mirth, that being in love with Him, she would force him by Charm to come to Her; a noble Boy, for that end, starv'd by Her to Death; or Love to others. You Gods, what-ere from Heaven the Earth Ore-sway, rule men of Mortal birth; What means this Tumult, why are thrown Deadly Eyes on me alone? By thine own Children, if to true Births call'd LUCINA aided you, By this vain Purple-garb more gay, And displeased JOVE, I pray, Why Step-dame-like dost view me round? Or at some Whale, felt Launces wound? When done these trembling Plaints, the Boy, Stript of Honour'd Roabs and joy, Stood tender Corps, whose naked sight Barbarous Thracian soften might. CANIDIA the Locks of whom Seem'd Vipers wreath'd, unus'd to Comb, Wild Fig-trees which from Graves did spring, Funeral Cypress call'd to bring; Eggs nointed with Frogs foulest Blood, Nightly Screich-Owls Plumes, as good; And what strange-Herbs Iolchos yields. Or Iberia's poysonous Fields: Snatcht bones from mouths of Dogs, when fasting, Into Colchick fires casting. When SAGAN, sprinkling strait the Floar. With Waters from Averna's shoar, Stiff-hair'd becomes most Hedghog like, Or brisled Boars when runs to strike. VEIA, whom Conscience nere could touch, Faint through Labours groaning much Dig'd with hard Spade a hole ith' ground: That so the Boy, near bury'd round; Food twice or thrice the Day set by, Then with-drawn might starving Dy: Since still his Mouth stood forth like those Hang'd by th' Chin ith' water close; That so his Marrow, Livour dry'd Might Love-potion prove, apply'd; After his Eys, on food untasted Fixed still, grew languid, wasted. That FOLIA the Witch was one, Whose Manlike Lust toward Females known Large quiet Naples with th' adjoin'd Town did believe, nor Rumour coin'd: Whose charm, Thessalian-voice doth even Moon and Stars pluck down from Heaven: Here fierce CANIDIA, biting hard (Black-tooth'd) her Thumb, whose nail unpar'd, What said she? said she not? O You, My affairs which order, do, Close Night and Moon of silence Queen (Whilst these sacred acts have been) Now present help, and 'gainst my Foe Your wrathful Deities forth show: Whilst dreadful Beasts in Lurking shades Drowzy, sweet Repose invades: Wench-fill'd Suburar's Dogs let bark At that old Leacher in the dark, When comes with Nard perfum'd, choice fine, As ere made by hands of Mine What's chanc'd? why fail those Poisons founded By MEDÆA fierce, compounded? With which of Creon's Daughter she (Royal Whore) took Vengeance free; When giving venom'd Robe did burn That new Bride, to cinders turn: Although nor Herb, nor pow'rful Root On Cliffs escap'd my hand to do't: He Sleeps (while charmed Bed daub'd o're) With dull forgetfulness of Whore: O vile! yet Varus rouz'd through Verse That Witch more skillful did rehearse Then walk'd by Potions strange unknown: O, who oft-times must weep and groan; Thou shalt run, fly to me, nor shall Thy lost mind Marsian Spells recal. Much stronger Cup I'l frame, produce, And through scornful thee infuse; Rather shall Skys sink down the Deep, Th' Earth aloft her station keep, Then thou not burn with Love-desires Of me, like Brimstone in black Fires. This spoke; the Boy not now asswag'd Those impious Hags with Pray'rs, enrag'd; But doubtful whence to break that hour Silence thus forth did Curses pour: Charms, though right, wrong confound, will not Hinder your Humane course, Deaths lot: I'l Curse you all, strong Execration Proves repell'd by no oblation: But when I'm gone, Death's wither'd Plant, Like Midnight Fury you I'l haunt; And scratch your Cheeks with ugly claws, Ghostly Gods such vengeance cause: Couching upon your anguish'd Hearts, Whilst fear-frighted Rest departs: The Croud shall stone you up and down, Beastly'st Hags through-out the Town: Wolves (last) Birds Exquiline each-where Your unbury'd Limbs shall bear Nor shall my Parents prove (surviv'd) Of that joyful Sight depriv'd. Epod. VI. Upon CASSIUS SEVERUS, an ill-tongu'd and abusive Poet. Why, envious Dog, dost harmless Strangers vex, Sloathful 'gainst the Wolvish train? Turn'st thou on me fond threats, as would'st perplex, Who if provok'd sholl Bite again? For like some Lacon-Dog, or Mastif Foe (Pastors friendly Guard though be) I shall with prickt-up ears, through mounting Snow Pursue that Beast precedeth me. Thou when th' hast fill'd the Wood with dreadful Voice, Thy scent dost use for Belly-chear: Snarler, take heed, for 'gainst such Bauling noise Still ready goring Horns I bear. Like injur'd Him 'gainst whom Lycambe rayl'd, Whom Bupalus Foe did try; Shall I, when prove with blacker Tooth assayl'd, Like unrevenged Boy go cry? To the People of ROME. Epod. VII. He inveighs against that Civil War, made by Brutus and Cassius on the one side, and by Octavianus, M. Antonius, and M. Lepidus on the other. Where Impious do you run? why fitted are Swords late sheath'd to th' Martial hand? As though small Latine blood through Civil War Purple-dy'd both Seas and Land: Not that the Romans might in flames display Envious Carthage haughty Tow'rs; Nor Brittains strong march through the sacred way, Chain'd, subjected by their pow'rs: But that this City might as Ruine fall By her own hand, Parthians desire: Thing nor by Wolves, nor Lions us'd, they all 'Gainst different formed Beasts conspire. Does some blind Madness seize, or fatal force, Wicked Mood? your answer show: Th' are dumb, their Cheeks turn'd pale through Bloods divorce, Minds perplext, amazed grow. 'Tis truth, most bitter Fates drive Romans on, That Guilt of slaughter'd Brothers Crime; Since harmless Vines drenc'd th' earth of REMUS gone, Curse found indeed to th' After-time. Epod. VIII. Omitted for good reasons. To MÆCENAS. Epod. IX. He feels that Joy beforehand which he should have (triumph prepar'd) for CÆSAR'S conquest of M. Anthony and Cleopatra. When shall I Drink with thee, MÆCENAS blest (CÆSAR full Conqueror in fine) Under thy lofty'st Roof, reserv'd for Feast, Cæcubian grape? JOVE'S will divine? Chanting mixt verse to th' Harp and Pipe (the first Dorick, last barbarous) as late We drank, when that Neptunian Chief, Sea-curst, Fled since Ships burn'd, compell'd by Fate. Threatning to Rome those Bonds he did unty (Friend once) from false Sicilian Slaves; Roman, which those unborn will sure deny, Mad Vassal turn'd to Female, raves. Brings logs for Trench, nor does joyn'd service shun With wrinkled Eunuches Ægypt-bred. Amongst whose Flags, whose warlike Tents the Sun Beholds base courtly Bridal bed. 'Gainst him the French, two thousand Horse, stout band Advanc'd proclaiming CÆSAR'S right; Whilst in th' Antonian Port, more o'th' left hand, Lodg'd swiftest Barks for eager flight. O Triumph, thou those Golden Chariots, thou Th' Oxen unslain dost yet defer; Nor didst thou from Jugurthine war, with Brow Palm-wreath'd, like valiant Captain bear. Nor th' African, although on Carthage-heap Virtue his Sepulcher did raise; Our conquer'd Foe by Sea and Land (more cheap) His Purple by for Sables lays. Or he's dispos'd for Creet through adverse Wind, Whom hundred Cities Tow'rs adorn; For Lybian sands with northern blast inclin'd, Or stray'd through doubtful Seas is born. Bring hither, Boy, Gobblets more large, advance With Chios grape, with Lesbian vine; Or fluid Qualms good to prevent (if chance) Pour forth to us Cæcubian wine: It pleases me in sweeter Juice my cares To drown, those doubts of CÆSAR'S grand Affairs. To MÆVIUS the Poet. Epod. X. Unworthy man. bad Poet, it seems, he prays in mirth, that Ship-wrack may befall him. Ship lanches forth with sadly ominous Bird, That stinking MÆVIUS doth bear; Batter both sides, with horid Waves concurr'd, Thou stern South-wind, remember there: Let East-mind black (ore-turning Depths) abuse Her Cables, Oars; dispersed, broke; And Northern blast, such as to rend does use, On Mountain-tops the trembling Oak: Nor friendly Star shine forth that blackest Night, When stormy, sad Orion falls; No calmer Sea transport then did affright Greek Conquerors, rac'd Trojan walls. When PALLAS did, Troy burnt, her blustering wrath 'Gainst Ajax impious Ship display. What foulest Sweat thy Seamen round will bath? Whilst thou wan-cheek'd appear'st like clay: With strange unmanly houl, or whining kind, Sower pray'rs sent to JOVE averse: When th' Adrian Port, roaring through Northern wind, Thy dismal Ship shall breaking pierce. But if most dainty Prey, on crooked Shore Stretch'd forth, for Sea-fowls thou become, Choice lustful Goat, black Lamb shall from the store Be sacrifiz'd to Storms, at home. Epod. XI. Omitted for good reasons. Epod. XII. Omitted for good reasons. To his FRIENDS. Epod. XIII. He exhorts that they would spend the Winter chearfully. Thick, horrid Storms through straitned sky display Snows, showrs, bring JOVE to Earth; now Woods and Seas With Thracian North resound: snatch from the Day Occasion, Friends, whilst knees prove strong, at ease; Whilst fit, Old-age with wrinkled brows dispel. Come, Wine advance TORQUATUS Consul prest, More mention not; God things may order well (Perhaps) through gracious change: Now pleases best Choice Persian Nard, perfumes, clear minds restor'd From direful Cares, with strings Mercurian. As Centaur sung to's Scholler-prince deplor'd Youth THETIS-born, no less unconquer'd Man: Thee waits that Trojan soil, whom cooler streams Of small Scamander, Simois fleet divide: Though darkned thence thy Sea-green Mother's beams, Since, Life-thread broke, return by Fates deny'd: There drown all ill, deformed Mischiefs, harms With Wine and Song, those sweetly pow'rful charms. To MÆCENAS. Epod. XIV. Disturb'd through PHRYNE'S love, he could not perform those promised Iambicks. Why soft Sloath hath such strange forgetfulness Through all my Pow'rs diffus'd, As if those Bouls whence Lethe-sleeps oppress My thirsty Jaws had us'd; MÆCENAS sweet, your oft Demands do kill: Forbidden hath a God That promis'd work, th' Iambicks, to fulfil, And crown with period. No less did burn Anacreon, 'tis told, Through bright Barsena's face; Who oft his love to th' Harp did sadly unfold, Lost choicer numbers grace. Thy self too scorch'd, but if not fairer Fire Burnt straitned Troy then thee Boast of thy chance loose Phryne's love, Desire Late Bond-Maid tortures me. To NEÆRA. Epod. XV. He complaineth of her Perjury. 'Twas Night, the Moon in clearest Sky did raign 'Mongst twinkling Starry train; When thou abusing Gods, those ears Divine, Didst swear that thou wast Mine: Clasping more close then th' Ivy Oak does hold, With gentlest Arms in fold; Whilst Wolves scare flocks, Seamen ORION'S Star, Wind winter waves at War; APOLLO'S Locks unshorn by Zephir tost, Joyn'd Love should ne're be lost, O NEÆRA, whom my braver Soul must grieve; If Horace man, believe, I'l not endure thee Nights with others spend, But choose complying Friend: Nor constant stoop to thy disdainful Form, If once shall truly storm. And thou whoere, thus Blest, by my Disgrace Grown proud and next in place, Though though be'st Lord of Lands fair flocks supream; Pactolus golden stream; For wisdom prove twice-born Pythagoras, Young Nyris form surpass; Thou't soon deplore through her inconstant Love; Whilst I shall Laughter prove. To the PEOPLE of ROME. Epod. XVI. He bewails the State, for its Civil Wars, Dissensions. Now second age is worn in Civil wars, And Rome by her own strength doth fall; Whom could not wast Marsians, our borderers, Porsenna's threatning hand enthral; Capua's emulous force, Spartacus rough, Th' unfaithful Gaul through new desires, Nor blew-ey'd German youth of sturdy proof, Hannibal, loath'd by mourning Sires, We shall destroy (foul, blood-devoted Age) Till streets do lodg wild Beasts agen; Her ashes stamp'd by barbarous Foe, bruis'd stage For horse resounding Hoofs, unclean: And Romulus bones, yet freed from Wind and Sun, Proud, wicked hands shall dissipate. Perchance you all, or th' better part, would shun Wars mischief, Toils, orewhelming fate, Let then this Councel move, as Phoceans Their City wandring fled, with Curse; Their houses, grounds resign'd, with hallow'd Fanes For Bores and wolvish dens, no worse; Let's go where feet can carry, Mates, where-ere The North shall call, or fierce South-wind: Is this approv'd best Vote? Why sails to rear Defer'd when Omen choice combin'd? But to this all be sworn, when Rocks the deep Shall gliding range, let's hasten home; When Poe the crest of Mount Matine, so steep, Shall washing scour, spread sails for Rome: When into th' Sea tall Apennine shall rush, Or Monsters mix through strangest Love New-coupled Limbs; Stags Tigers kindly crush; Adulterate with Rites the Dove: Nor credulous Heards the yellow Lion fear, Smooth Goat rejoyc'd with brinish Wave; These vow'd, resolv'd; so fond returns forswear Let's go with general Voice and brave, Or Wiser part then th' ill-train'd Croud; the rest (Soft, fearful) to their Beds give o're. You vertuous Ones plaints womanish detest, And fly beyond th' Etruscan shore; Th' all wandring Ocean prove those blisful fields Let us regard those wealthy Isles, Where th' Earth unplough'd her Annual harvest yields; And Vine unprun'd with plenty smiles: Where th' Olive-branch gives full and lage Account, Black-cheeked Fig Trees kindly graces; Moist Honey streams from th' hallow'd Oak, soft Fount Leaps from the Hills with murmuring paces. There Goats unbid to th' Milking pale do come, Stretch'd Dugs in friendly Flocks abound; No Evening-bears 'bout Folds do bauling roam, Nor swells with Viper-brood the ground. More things you'l blest admire, that moist East-wind Ne're gluts the Soil with dashing show'rs; Nor those fat Seeds prove burnt through droughts unkind, Heav'ns king since tempers both conforms. Ne're Argos-pine with Oars did thither hast, Medean Witch lust harbour there; Nor Cadmus troop with horned Sayls and Mast, ULISSES toilsome Band appear: No Murrains cattle wrong, nor scorch'd their Flock Through Stars bad raging heats, effect. JOVE still conceal'd those Shores for pious Stock, Gold-times with Brass when did infect; Though now to Iron hardned hath our Age, Whence good Men may for happy Flight idgage. To CANDIDIA. Epod. XVII. He begs in sport that she would pardon him feigning himself conquer'd by her Witchcrafts, since had late publish'd them. Lo, now I yield; such thy grand Art this hour; And beg by PROSERPINE'S infernal power, By th' Deity of DIAN great, unmov'd; And by those Books, whose charming Verse approv'd Can call down Stars from Heav'n, where fixed fast, CANIDIA, cease those direful sounds at last; And summon back that Whirlwind-storm, be mild. King Telephus (fierce Nereus Grandchild) ACHILLES sooth'd, 'gainst whom stout Mysian Band Had proudly sent sharp Darts from threatning hand. Joy'd Trojan wives embalm'd, though long detain'd, Man-killing HECTOR'S Corps, for dogs ordain'd, Wild beasts and fowl; when PRIAM (left the Wall) Prostrate before that sturdi'st Chief did fall. Those toilsome Mates, Ulisses Mariners, Their brisled Limbs laid by when (clear'd from jars) CIRCE well pleas'd; Mind. Humane Voice did then Return, their Locks shew'd wonted grace agen. I've now endur'd full punishment, and more, O thou whom Seamen love, admire, implore; My Youth's consum'd, fresh, bashful Colour gone. From cloathed Bones, and swarthiness put on. My Hair turn'd Grey through those thy Fumes opprest, No couch with ease from Torture give me rest: Night day thrusts on, Day night with endless smart, Nor can I cool with Breathing gales my Heart. Thus am I wretch orecome, made now believe, That charming Verse tormented hearts can grieve: Dire Marsian Songs make shatter'd heads to mourn, What would'st thou more? O Seas and Land I burn, More then did HERCULES with blackest blood Of Centaur Nessus daub'd, or raging Flood Of fires in Ætna's womb: thou, still dost find Me Ashes-like tost by th' injurious Wind, Flam'st here like Shop with Colchis-poyson stor'd; What end remains? What mulckt shall I afford? Speak't out, the Doom my flesh shall nought withstand Resold'd to expiate, should'st thou command An hundred Bullocks strait; or would'st thou be With lying Harp pronounc'd chast, vertuous She? Like golden Star thou traverse shalt the Skyes, Castor displeas'd, since touch'd through verse unwise HELLEN'S bad fame, with's Brother (angry men) Suit made, restor'd to th' Poet eyes agen; So thou, who canst, my former Brain restore O free'd from Parents sordid filth. What's more, No learn'd Oldwife for scattering nine days Dust From poor men's Sepulchers; such things unjust: Mild breast thou bear'st with purest hands from ill; Thy Womb brings forth, and Midwife cleanseth still Thy clouts made red through Childbirth-blood, when ere Thou risest up strong, lusty Mother there. Epod. XVIII CANIDIA'S Answer, shewing that no Prayers shall overcome her, since the Poet had divulg'd her Witchcrafts, so abus'd her. Why dost pour forth thy Pray'rs to closed Ears? Not Rocks more deaf to Seamen drown'd in Fears; Whom NEPTUNE batters oft with brinish Wave; Shalt thou, unscourg'd, my dark flesh-rites deprave? And noise abroad those Spells of free Desire? Rome with my Name (revengeless) daub'd like mire? Grand Priest advanc'd o'th' Witchcraft Esquiline. Thou see'st Pelignian Hags, with vain design, Some nimbler Drug for killing to compound; Since slower Fates, then wisht, shall thee confound. Thy tedious Life protracted, Wretch shall be, That thou mai'st bear more Plagues, new misery. PELOPS unfaithful Sire, that TANTALUS Needs friendly Food, repose still longs for thus. So longs PROMETHEUS still to th' Vulture ty'd; Sisiphus too that Stone would fixt abid On th' Mountains top; but JOVE withdraws the power. Sometimes thou would'st leap down from lofty Tower, Sometimes with Sword rip up thy Breast, too weak: In vain thou shalt knit Halters for thy Neck; Through loathsome Grief orewhelm'd, sad Scoffers pride, When on thy hateful Back I'l mounted ride: And shrinking Earth my Insolence shall prove. Shall I, that can make waxen Statues move (As thon dost, Peeper, know) by charming sound Pluck down the Moon from th' Heavenly Pole to ground; Temper that Drink of strong desire, if please; Complain my Art on thee should nothing seize? Epod. XIX. HORACE his secular Poem, for the safety of the Romane Empire: Phæbus, dian, Woods ruling Power; Joyn'd grace of Heav'n (O worthy still To be ador'd) in hallow'd hour Our Suits fulfil. When SIBIL'S warning Verse recounts, Choice Girls with purest Youths should sing Anthem to th' Gods, seven stately Mounts Still favouring. Indulgent Sun, whose Charret bright Draws forth the Day, then shrouds conceal'd; New-born, yet the Old none greater fight Then Rome beheld. ILITHIA, th' Assistant mild To Births mature, please Mothers soon; Whether LUCINA nam'd or stil'd Th' ingendring Moon. Goddess, our stock enlarge, and bless Decrees for joyning Womankind; Prosper that Husbands law no less, New race defign'd. That so ten times ten years may frame (Done certain Orb) Songs, sports delight; Thrice by clear Day, as oft the same When pleasing Night. And you Truth-speaking Fates, that chose Great Rome, let fixt Event at last Shew what's decree'd; Good days to those Conjoyn o're-past. Let th' Earth with Fruits and Cattle stor'd CERES with Crown of corn present Whilst strength sweet waters, Air afford What Earth does vent. APOLLO mild, thy Darts unseen, Hear Youths (well pleas'd) imploring grace; And LUNA thou, Stars horned Queen, The Virgin-race. If Rome's your work, if Trojan Bands Through you sought Tuscan shores, did change Town, Country-Gods by your commands; Far safely range: Whom through Troys burning Fires so great ÆNEAS chast, since Friends surviv'd, Did strongly guard; found better Seat Then those depriv'd. Gods grant our Youth good manners taught Gods grant Old age content, repose; With Off-spring power, let Rome be fraught; Whilst wealth oreflows. And let ANCHYSES, Venus seed, White Bulls which on your Altars throw, Rule Lords in War; though gentle indeed To th' prostrate Foe. Mede fears our Land and Naval strength, Those Alban Axes deem'd their Fate; And Scithians court mild Terms, at length, Proud Ind of late. Faith, Concord, Worth, with Modesty Now dare t'appear; and quite forlorn Vertue's restor'd; rich Plenty free, With pregnant horn. PHEBUS all-wise, with glistering Bow, Choice friend belov'd o'th' Muses nine, That cheers Faint, drooping Mortals so Through art Divine; Palatine Towr's if own'd his charge, Rome's wealth and strength of Latium For five years more may he enlarge: Best Age to come. DIANA too, Mount Algidus Which holds with lofty Aventine, To th' fifteen Men (sports ord'ring thus) Youths prayers incline. That JOVE and Gods do these allow, Strong hopes I bear, since PHÆBUS praise, Learn'd Quire, with joyn'd DIANA'S now Can chanting blaze.FINIS.</field>
