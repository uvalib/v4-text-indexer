these wordes/to god I make auow If that I knewe to lyue here after yow I sholde so deale/that I afore wolde go The teeres fell downe fro her eyen two Thus he demaundeth her with wordes fayre All be it

he troweth that she hym loueth wele Thus he in herte is eased euery dele Bycause he seeth her som what wepe afore He trusteth that she loueth hym the more Wherof he hath a pyteous herte and mynde And can not be in rest tyll that he fynde The wayes how he may her content &amp; ease All that he can/he dooth her for to please In dyuers wyse/with laboure and trauayle But all for nought/it may nothynge auayle For she alwaye awayteth for to pyke Upon the stroke that she afore dyde stryke That is to saye/a newe gowne wolde she haue The whiche for cruell stomocke nolde she craue She passeth tyme/and no

malyce dooth she steke Soone after this cometh the seconde nyght That she to bedde must go as is it ryght With her good man/&amp; whan that she is layde In bedde/than he whiche is not wele apayde Beholdeth wele loketh and taketh kepe On her to knowe/whether that she wake or slepe He well aduyseth yf her armes bothe Be couered wele and surely with the clothe And heleth them yf nede or mayster

I haue bethought me of a thynge ye shall be at my cosynnes weddynge And ye shall haue ordeyned as goodly gere For you as ony gentyl woman there Certes she sayth/all thoughe ye saye the best Of all this yere/I wyll go to no feest Now by my fayth he sayth but yet ye shall And what ye wyll demaunde haue gowne &amp; all What I demaunde she sayth/that is ryght nought For syr so god me helpe that all hath wrought I aske not to be Ioly for enuy Gladde wolde I be forsothe yf neuer I Out of your hous but vnto chyrche sholde passe Matyns to here euensonge and masse I saye it not ne yet no wayes seche Sauynge onely for suche vngoodly speche As was amonges other whiche I knewe By my gossyp/whome I fynde euer trewe For she the wordes harde all openly The whiche she shewed me full secretely Than thynketh moche this poore newe wedded man And in his mynde to compace he began Consyderynge in what caas that he stode A newe husholde hauynge lytell gode And moche to do he had by many a waye Not purueyed wele grete sommes to paye And fyfty scutes or syxty for this gowne He must bestowe/and shortly laye it downe And in his thought/cast a cheuysaunce For there may be none other waye ne chaunce But that this gowne nedely must be had Wherwith and other gere she shall be clad For he perceyued hath/by his aduyse His wyfe a woman is/bothe good and wyse He thanketh god/the lorde of heuen blysse So fayre a Iuell/to gyue hym as she is From one syde to an other/he turneth ofte In bedde he slepeth not though he lye softe And it may happen soo/his Wyfe this seeth Whiche subtyll is/and she within her teeth Wyll laughe/whan that she knoweth his conceyte Whome she hath ouercome/with her deceyte After this nyght/whan comen is the morowe Aryseth vp this good man full of sorowe All ouercome with syghes/that he hath take The nyght afore/for his good wyues sake And in auenture to the market gothe With pawne or credence/for to by the clothe And straytly vnto marchauntes he hym byndeth Or elles to them suche Iuelles as he fyndeth Whether they be of syluer/or of golde Whiche he somtyme had/of his fader olde Then sellteh he/or elles .x. pounde or more Of rente in mortgage layeth he therfore Shortly this man/dooth so his maters spede That he hath all suche thynges as in that nede Wherwith he cometh home all spedyly And to haue thanke he demeth veryly She syenge this/made semblaunt hym before As though suche cost myght well haue ben forbore And that nothynge/she sette by gowne ne gayre That he home brought with hym for her repayre Cursynge all them with tonge/&amp; not with thought That fyrst so grete estate and porte vp brought And whan she knewe that thynge was sure she sayd To her good man and hym besought and prayed He neuer sholde reproue her of the daye That she had made hym spende for her araye His money or his goodes/and neuermore Her to rebuke/or elles vmbrayde therfore For by the gowne set I nothynge she sayth So that I may me kepe frome colde in fayth And alway haue one peny in my purse Whiche wyll suffyse to me though it were worse Anone was made this gowne/and eke an hood Also a gyrdell whiche was ryche and good And now are comen the termes &amp; the houres Whan that he must content his credytoures And this poore man not able is to paye Bycause his golde and syluer ben awaye And lenger wyll they not forbere this man But execute in all the haast they can They curse on hym/&amp; she the same perceyueth And therof all the circumstaunce conceyueth And perauenture afore this curse procede Or elles after the lawe dooth hym forbede In chyrche to be/wherfore his company Men wyll eschewe and grudge all vtterly Hauynge dysdayne with hym to drynke &amp; ete And he but lytell hath and none can gete Of money out of daunger hym to brynge God wote what Ioye he hath in his lyuynge His wyfe goth cryenge in the hous aboute Wherwith a noyse she maketh and a showte And thus she sayth/ha cursed be the houre That I was euer in my moders boure Forth brought or borne/alas it had not happed That in the cloth/wherin I was fyrst lapped I had be buryed/for neuer so grete shame Betydde to ony woman ne dyffame As to me and my kynne/now shall be layd Alas I laboure sore/and fast she sayd And all the laboure besynesse and cost That I haue done of many a daye is lost In twenty places or moo I had be maryed If I so wolde/but lyke a fole I taryed For where I myght grete honour &amp; auayle Haue had/and rychesse/therof now I fayle I knowe how that theyr wyues be bysene That wolde haue maryed me/whiche doth me And therfore haue I heuynesse and wo That deth the lyfe nyll take my body fro Thus she complayneth her withouten care Of her husbande/or how the good man fare For hooly she hath sette her mynde vpon Her owne estate/and shortely she is gon Unto this maryage/and where she sholde Haue thought vpon her husbande she ne wolde But to this poore man putteth all the wyte Lyke as an hors that can bothe playne &amp; byte This woman dooth/and she is cause of all For she this man hath made so bestyall Somwhat for sorowe/or elles wyse by playe That well nygh wasted is his wytte a waye So that he wyll not vnderstonde ne knowe That she is in defaute/wyll he not trowe And though he se the maters euydent yet of necessytee he is content But of the thought &amp; sorowes to enquere It is but waast/syth ye the causes here Of this man whiche can neyther rest ne slepe That thynketh euery houre and taketh kepe How that he may in ease this woman sette And fynde some remedy to paye his dette But yet is he more angry for his wyfe Whiche curseth hym/than all that other stryfe Thus soroweth he/in pouertee downe fall And frome that payne recouer neuer shall Prycked he is/but smarte can he none fele That all is Ioye/to hym it semeth wele Thus is this man within the lepe yclosed And parauenture so he is dysposed That he nothynge therof dooth hym repent For yf that he out of the same were hent Soone wolde he go agayne in to that gynne And all his payne and woo newly begynne yet sholde he neuer be in soo good cas As he hath ben afore he maryed was And there this poore man shall vse his lyfe Endynge his dayes in wretchednes &amp; stryfe Thus endeth the fyrst Ioye of maryage. Here begynnes the seconde Ioye of maryage. As for the seconde Ioye of maryage It is whan y? this wyfe of her courage Feleth that she so rychely is arayed In suche a wyse as here tofore is sayd And knoweth well ynough y? she is fayre Than wyll she go frome home to take the ayre To many feestes and assembles eke And also holy sayntes for to seke On dyuers pylgrymages wyll she go All though the husbande be not pleased so Her Iourney enterpryseth she to ryde With her cosyon and gossyppes at a tyde And specyally for her kynnesmannes sake Her pylgrymage deuoutly wyll she take And perauenture yet it may soo be That this man is as nyghe kynne vnto me As vnto her/but soo hym for to call Wonte and accustomed is she ouer all It may be thought for some entent or cause She calleth hym soo/but there I leue a clause Her moder than seynge her besynesse Cometh somtyme to this man I gesse And as a woman can begynne to clatter She sayth his herte to tycle and flatter This foresayd man/her cosyn is of blode For her to go with suche a company is good And other whyle the husbande is lothe That she sholde go/sayth sadly by his othe How he none horses hath ne other thynge Her to conuey to feest or gaderynge Than shall the gossyp or her cosyn saye I am ryght lothe by god and by this daye To go/for myn hous so god me spede Moche thynge haue I to do of very nede And were it not honour to you and me Speke wolde I not as now so mote I the For syr soo god me helpe I knowe it wele your wyfe to go is pleased neuer a dele She is a woman leest that loueth waast Of ony lyuynge/for euer she dooth haast Home warde whan she at ony place is oute For your expence &amp;

serued For loue of her good man all vndeserued And god wote how she doth herselfe applye To reuell daunce/and for to synge on hye Also she maketh good and mery chere But god wote how she prayseth her bedfere The husbande lefte at home whyle she is oute And seeth herselfe so praysed amonge the route Certes these galauntes than her do aduyse And se she is apparaylled in suche wyse Perceyuynge well her chere and countenaunce Shortely to hex eche one hym doth auaunce One profreth moche/an other offreth more Harde is to me the cause to tell wherfore The Ioly chere the praty trotte and pace With the demeanynge of a womans face Wyll gyue these louers cause &amp;
