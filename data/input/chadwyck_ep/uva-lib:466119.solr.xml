Ãsch., Ag., 172. In accordance with the Author's known intention, THIS POEM IS (BY PERMISSION) RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED TO The Hon. Lady Filmer, As a Tribute of Admiration and Gratitude. CANTO FIRST. THE LOVERS. ARGUMENT. The loversâThe trysting placeâThe first cloudâContritionâ Reflections suggested by the stormâThe libraryâThe âstill small voiceââThe consolations of âthe BookââSleepâThe maiden's altered viewsâHer fearsâThe influence of prayer âThe maiden's chamberâThe sleeping girlâMidnight in the libraryâThe council of the Spirits of the BooksâThe subject of debate.âThe argumentâThe speeches of the Spirits of EpiscopacyâInfidelity and SatireâThe sentence of the Spirit of LawâThe Spirits of the Night employed in their vocations. I. The time, eve's pensive, soul-felt hour; The season, balmy May; No sound disturbed the stillness of The gently fading day; Around was spread a varied scene, That harmonized full wellâ The verdant wood, the winding stream, Green hill, and mossy dellâ A landscape that is sought in vain, Though fairer realms there be, Except within thy âsea-girt isle,â My own, my dear Countrie. II. Clad in a robe of golden hue, The sun had sunk to rest, Some traces of his glorious course Still lingered in the West; Above the river's glassy face Light wreaths of vapour lay (The incense offered by the stream To the bright God of day); The air's transparent brilliancy Permits the eye to trace The outline of the distant hills, No longer lost in space. III. Beneath the shadow of the wood Two forms are faintly seen; A nearer view proclaims the one A youth of noble mien; And standing by him is a maid, Whose face and form might vie With any traced by limner's hand, Or sung by minstrelsie: The encircled waist, the resting head The hour, the spot declare That these are votaries of love, That seek a refuge there. IV. Yet something doth betoken A difference of degree; The pride of birth breaks forth in him, More lowly far is she; His name, with sound familiar, Falls on the list'ner's ear; While hers is as an unknown word Beyond her hamlet's sphere; His father is a belted Earl; Hers but a yeoman true; Too oft assortment such as this Doth make a maiden rue. V. 'Twere long to tell how first they met; Some timely service shown Had forced the maid, scarce consciously, Her gratitude to own; That springe, oft set for woman's love, Doth seldom miss its prey; From gratitude to love there lies A broad and beaten way; And, as the mutual flame gained strength, More frequently they met, Till meeting formed their only joy, Parting their sole regret. VI. Those happy evening meetings! How long appeared the day; The sun was hateful to their eyes, Save when his parting ray With mellow light the landscape tinged And deeper grew the shade, Till twilight's veil enabled them, Unseen, to seek the glade, Their right-well-chosen trysting place; Oaks stood like sentries round; Well might the legend favour find That called it âfairy groundâ; Or it had been in other days A Druid's sacred grot, And superstition still attached Her mystery to the spot. VII. Oft in her course the conscious moon Was witness to their vows, Darting her prying beams aslant The friendly shelt'ring boughs; Or, at her zenith height arrived, The traitorous orb revealed The glow of happiness and love The maid would have concealed, But that her gentle trusting heart No longer owned control, So thoroughly, so cunningly, Had love usurped the whole. Here, 'neath the trembling foliage, Their faltering tongues confessed The ever-changing hopes and fears That fill a lover's breast. VIII. Here too they parted, sad and loath, Until the morrow's night With the loved object once again Should bless their raptured sight. How changed the scene! the murm'ring breeze Seemed sadly to complain; The dewy ev'ning wept as if It shared their mutual pain; The lengthened kiss, the pressure fond, The oft repeated word, Proved that the measured hints of time No longer were unheard; And, after parting, yet again They turned with eager pace, As if by some attraction drawn To join in close embrace. IX. Now, sigh to sigh re-echoing, Reluctantly they part; While every falling footstep strikes A knell to either heart; Each returns home stealthily, And seeks, unseen, to gain Their chamber's silence, and indulge In memory's pleasing pain: Again live o'er that stolen hour, Each look, each accent weigh; And gild the ideal future With hope's illusive ray. X. Ah! happy time, ah! heaven on earth! Why should experience tear The graceful veil through which the world Assumed a shape so fair? Why not in happy ignorance Let us be cheated still? Thou worst of pedants, who wouldst make Of every joy an ill! By thy harsh hateful lesson, Alas! we only gain The fatal knowledge that the world Is hollow, false, and vain. XI. Thus oftentimes these lovers met, In innocence complete; The maiden's guileless heart knew naught Of caution or deceit; Her gentle eyes are raised to his, And all her actions prove The unsuspecting confidence That marks a virgin's love: Nor ever had his answ'ring glance Compelled her to look down; His eyes spoke only sentiments Responsive to her own. XII. Until a sultry evening, That closed a sultry day; The sun sank red and threatening; All lurid was his ray; The blushing clouds reflected back His angry parting beams; The coppery mass, with livid spots, Some conflagration seems; The large raindrops, the wind's low moan, The air o'ercharged and warm, Are heralds unmistakable, That speak the coming storm. XIII. Why do the maiden's downcast eyes So often seek the ground? Why gazes she so hurriedly And anxiously around? Why should she seek her home to-night At this unwonted hour? She dreads, perchance, the gathering clouds That round her darkly lour; Or do his heightened colour And brightly flashing eye Inspire her with a vague alarm, Albeit she knows not why? XIV. His arm, whose twining, fond support She almost woo'd till now, Seems to imprison her slight form Too closely to allow The action of her beating heart; His voice, whose lightest word, In her unfathomed depth of soul, Some gushing well-spring stirred, Has lost those tones harmonious, No longer low and clear, Its harsh and altered character Awake instinctive fear. XV. A prey to doubts, till now unknown, The maiden marked the change; Which, to her gentle nature, showed Mysteriously strange; She tried by soft caresses to Recall his usual mood; But only added fuel to The fever of his blood; Till, frightened at his vehemence, She homeward bent her way, Nor could his oft-repeated prayer Prevail on her to stay. XVI. He sought forgiveness humbly, His wild and eager air Was changed to sigh and sorrow, To entreaty and despair; The lightnings of his eyes no more Brought blushes to her brow; The tongue, erewhile so eloquent, Where was its witchery now? That too persuasive mute appeal Her heart could not repel; He sealed his pardon on her lips, Ere he would say farewell. XVII. They parted, yes, they parted; Alas! not as they met; Love's sunshine had been darken'd by The shadow of regret; And Hope and Fear, alternately, With all their powers try, Within their battle-field, the heart, To gain the mastery; Till, wearied with the doubtful strife, The rivals quit the plain, And calm reflection takes the place Vacated by the twain. XVIII. He seeks the ancestral mansion, But in his speaking face The stamp of feelings uncontrolled Has left its searing trace; The lips compressed, the frowning brow, The eyes all downward bent, Betray the man who has been galled, And foiled in his intent; While the flushed cheek, the heaving chest, The low convulsive sigh, Show that, within his inmost heart, Passion doth lurking lie. XIX. His bosom's ruder feelings calmed, The drooping eyelids prove The presence of those soft alarms, Which haunt the course of love! The loss of that pure virgin heart, The dread of her disdain, Strike, like the sudden thought of death, Across his reeling brain; He finds, too late, that he who 'lists Beneath Love's banner may Receive the wound he would inflict, Nor quit unscathed the fray. XX. Thus long in musing mood he stood, And watched the threatened storm, Its fitful violence awoke The soul's undying worm; The lightning's fierce and livid flash, So short and yet so bright, Which rendered blacker tenfold The darkness of the night, Suggested to his conscious heart Unbridled passion's joy Blazing in lawless wantonness, To wither and destroy. XXI. The answering burst of thunder That followed in its train, Arousing, with electric peal, Alike earth, air, and main; The fitful gust, the moaning cry, The shrieking of the wind, The angry lashing of the rain, Presented to his mind, The exulting shout of vengeance, The victim's wild complaint, Earth's universal hatred, Let loose without restraint. XXII. Awed by the elemental strife, Nor able to control The current of reproachful thought That sweeps across his soul, He seeks a book, but o'er the page His glances idly stray, No interest, nor meaning do The characters convey; In the sealed volume of his heart, He reads, with fear intense, The wiles which Guilt would fain array 'Gainst helpless Innocence. XXIII. Could storied page or poet's lay Have soothed the youth's unrest; Could subtle reason's power have quelled The tumult of his breast; Could science have delighted, Or eloquence have charmed, History have raised an interest, Or patriotism warmed; Each in that chamber had its place; It was the owner's care To add to the collected store All that was good or rare. XXIV. Ranged, in due order, on the shelves, Up from the floor beneath, Lay all that human intellect Has power to bequeath; The old and ponderous volumes, Which formed the lower tier, A pyramid of lighter works Seemed, atlas-like, to bear; E'en as the sages of the past Have never ceased to be At once a prop and stepping stone To their posterity. XXV. A solitary lamp relieved The centre of the room, Giving the scarce distinguished walls A character of gloom; While, here and there, the time-dy'd oak Reveal'd some figure grim, Which seem'd unto the youth to scowl Malignantly on him: Others grinned hideous welcome; And one, with leering eye, Seemed conscious of his inmost thoughts, By sin's freemasonry. XXVI. He rose and paced the noble room, Expecting, but in vain, By exercise to chase away These phantoms of the brain; But every footfall conjured up A dull and hollow sound; He felt like one who walks, by night, Within a charnel ground; And when he uttered words aloud, To banish such weak fears, A thousand echoes, mockingly, Resounded in his ears. XXVII. At length his mind's complexion Assumed a healthier tone; His eyes, with hardier, prouder glance, Around the room were thrown; Again he sought a book's relief, And, 'neath his hand, he found That âSacred Volumeâ on which faith Its only hope doth ground; He opened it; each word divine Said to his soul âbe stillâ: He felt it was a talisman To shield him from all ill. XXVIII. He thought of her who, formerly, With all a mother's joy, Had tried untiringly to teach Its lessons to her boy: Might not that guide, though taken hence, Her earthly labour done, From the bright mansions of the blessed Look down upon her son? His heart o'erflowed, and welcome tears, Falling as dews from heaven, Cooled the strong fever of the mind, Too full of earthly leaven. XXIX. The recollection of the days when, Free from passion's thrall, He passed his childhood's happy yearsâ The happiest of allâ Soothed him, and o'er his spirit threw A mild and holy calm; Lost in the mazes of the past, The present ceased to charm; Till he confounds, insensibly, The present with the past, As nature, o'er his tired soul, Sleep's grateful mantle cast. XXX. And she, the gentle, loving one, When by her instinct taught To fly from him who hitherto Had owned her every thoughtâ Her home she entered silently, And, shunning question, fled; In the wild tumult of her soul, Scarce hearing what was said: Once in her chamber's refuge hid, She proved the sad relief Which tears, unchecked and unobserved, Afford to woman's grief. XXXI. All to her view seemed sadly changed, Yet why she could not tell; She felt like one who suffers 'neath The influence of a spell; She tried to think, before the attempt Her very senses reeled; She saw the danger unto which Till now her eyes were sealed; No more the sunny prospect smiled, Her vision of the morn; But, in its place, a gloomy gulf Seemed bottomless to yawn. XXXII. More calm, at length she checked her tears, And felt, with rising sigh, The want of a fond mother's heart, On which she might rely; That Altar which received her griefs In childhood's peaceful days, When sorrow's dew was quickly dried By joy's absorbing rays: Till now she never truly felt The value of that friend On whom alone, in doubt and fear, A daughter can depend. XXXIII. Many a circumstance, till now Buried in memory's store, Before her mental vision rose As vivid as of yore; Those words of caution and advice, Which seemed so needless then, Struck like an echo from the tomb, And mutely spoke again; Could that mild voice advise her now, Banish her doubts and fears! Useless, alas! her vain regrets, Futile her bitter tears. XXXIV. Sudden upon her startled ear The pealing thunder broke; Its warning tones within her soul A host of terrors woke; In the fantastic lightning's play She traced a giant form, Who, throned on clouds of darkness, rode, The demon of the storm; Or shuddered, as a brilliant flash Seemed, serpent-like, to dart Full on the mansion which enshrined The treasure of her heart. XXXV. No longer mistress of her fears, She sought relief in prayer. Her hands pressed on her aching eyes Shut out the lightning's glare; She prayed for pardon; prompted by The monitor within, She now, for the first time, perceived Her secret was a sin; Yet he had asked for secrecy, And her soft nature knew No words to wound the heart of one So noble and so true. XXXVI. Calmed by her pious exercise, Her virgin couch she sought, But sleep was powerless 'gainst a mind So occupied by thought; She tried to think of earlier scenes; Alas! the attempt was vain; The sterile past served but to bring The present back again; She could not school her memory, Nor banish from its seat The thought of him who first had taught Her maiden heart to beat. XXXVII. Nature's great boon at length prevailed, The maiden sank to rest; Kind sleep, with pitying finger, Her throbbing eyelids pressed: The phantoms of the night retired As soon as rising dayâ Smiling upon the sleeping girl With soft and rosy rayâ Revealed the scene around her, And slowly brought to view Her chamber's simple ornaments, Albeit they were few. XXXVIII. The curtains sheltering her couch Of virgin, spotless white, Shaded a form as angel's pure, A face as seraph's bright; Her head thrown slightly backward, And draperied by her hair, Pressed on her pillow tenderly; Her forehead smooth and fair; The fringes of her close-veiled eyes Swept her soft velvet cheek; Her lips were gently parted, As if about to speak; A rising blush, a murmured word, A soft, half sobbing sigh, Proved sleep scarce equal to the task Of conquering memory. XXXIX. One careless arm thrown round her head Disclosed a neck of snow; The ripening beauties of her form Swell'd gracefully below; The light and clinging covering An outline helped to trace, Suggestive, in its harmony, Of modesty and grace; All spoke of purity and peace; The quiet of the hour, The fragrant breath of morning, The perfume of the flower, Which, round her lattice twining close, Seemed jealous that the day Should dare to throw his searching eyes Where its loved mistress lay. XL. Quit we the chamber noiselessly, With blessings on that brow, And to the sleeping youth return, And suffer time to show The issue of the encounter; For conflict must there be, Where Love would try conclusions With Pride, his enemy; Love rears the airy fabric high, Love sanctifies the place; But, like a secret enemy, Pride undermines the base. XLI. The youth slept on, and all was still, Except the flickering light By the expiring lamp sent forth, Then all was solemn night. Silence and darkness jointly reigned, Until the midnight chime, Borne on the fitful gust, proclaimed The ceaseless march of Time; Told that another day was gone, Another morrow come, Another step in man's career Of progress to the tomb. XLII. The last chime past, the chamber's gloom Was suddenly dispelled; The crowded shelves, which until now Had inert volumes held, Were peopled, and each single work Its proper guardian owned; Naught could be seen, where books had been, But shadowy forms enthroned, Their eyes of flame shed o'er the place A wild, unearthly light, Revealing evanescent shades Unknown to mortal sight. XLIII. The sages of antiquityâ The giants of the past, Around the peopled chamber Their curious glances cast; With look profound, and eagle eye, They scanned the lettered throng; Or smiled approvingly upon The nobler sons of song; Or changed a mute intelligence With him the first to trace The unerring laws of nature, And pierce the realms of space. XLIV. There might be seen the ascetic monk, With fast and vigil worn, Whose sallow, sickly cheek matched well The parchment soiled and torn; Here the more modern churchman, Who, with a ruddier hue, Reflects his gorgeous binding In colours no less true: A new arrival looks askant, Supposing he must be âThe observed of all observersâ In this society. XLV. The Catholic, the Protestant, Rome, and the rebel crew, And that late innovation, The compound of the two, Are strangely mixed, while unbelief, With cold and withering sneer, Seems half suspicious of the host Of Orthodoxy near; Though, in their want of unity, He fancies he may find Some converts, who, to views extreme, Are not at all inclined. XLVI. Naught breaks the silence of the night; Each spirit seems to wait Some warning signal, which shall serve To open the debate; Their flashing eyes all turn on one Who differs from the rest, Love, Might, Dominion, Majesty, Are all in him expressed; As, in the centre of the room, With mild and thoughtful look, Watching the sleeping youth, appears The Spirit of âthe Book.â XLVII. He spoke, and music's sweetest tones Are harsh, beyond compare, To the celestial harmony That floated in the air; His voice in gentlest accents fell In words of simplest guise; Soft pity seemed to hold her throne Within his beaming eyes, As o'er the unconscious slumberer He stretched his sheltering arm; Each spirit owned, in silent awe, The influence of the charm. THE SPIRIT OF âTHE BOOK.â âSleep, Son of Earth, who, in thy thoughtless age, Hast sought for consolation in my page. May its great lessons be on thee impressed; May they have taken root within thy breastâ There wilt thou learn that in this world below Man should assuage, and not increase, the woe Which falls to mortal lot; Ah! happiest he Who to each dispensation bows the knee; In trial draws fresh comfort from on high, Knowing that man must suffer ere he die; Till, weaned by trouble from all earthly things, He mounts to Heaven on Faith's upsoaring wings. Sleep overtook thee lapped in Fancy's arms; May'st thou awake to wisdom's purer charms; E'en from thy youth (thanks to an angel gone; To her may'st thou still prove a worthy son) Thou hast been wont to seek for counsel here; In thy ripe life may its full fruit appear: May duty's laws a tenfold force acquire; May each command a higher awe inspire; May the instructions which those lips let fall Be thy best guide, thy rule, thy all in all. From sharp temptation mayst thou still be free: Or strong, if tempted: gifted mayst thou be With sense to feel the littleness of pride; And, not too soon, thy sainted mother died. Sad would it be to deem such efforts vain To guide a son athwart life's thorny plain; Say, spirits, nurtured thus, will this youth be A limb of Satan or a child to me?â THE SPIRIT OF INFIDELITY. âA child of thine!â replied, with mocking laugh, The spirit of the Infidel; âwhy, half His soul is forfeit now; a child of thine! Why, surely you forget his lordly line; His ancestryâtheir place in history's page; His father's pride, his wealth, his heritage; What! shall the heir apparent of an Earl Stoop to a marriage with a peasant girl? Shall the bright blazon of eight hundred years Be dimmed to save a yeoman's daughter's tears? Though, sooth to say, if honest, fair descent From sire to son in line direct were meant, The yeoman has the peer upon the hip, And might be hard on many a noble slip; And all because this well-begotten youth Has sipped the waters of the well of Truth; Was, by his mother, taught to lisp his prayers, And still preserves this trick of childish years; No! I'm a sceptic in some things, 'tis true, But, knowing the race, I almost doubt that you Believe this possible. What! brave the sneer Of all his tribe, e'en of some mushroom peer, Who, gorged with city gains, aspires to be A graft of England's old nobility. Or failing this (the thing has oft been done), The upstart fool may buy a lordly son; Regild some bankrupt title, and essay To infuse wealth's sap through drained nobility: Why care for any failings in the man, Though spendthrift, blackleg, rake, or fool, he can Boast of his daughter's rank, and fairly, too; For, having bought the title, 'tis his due: And though, poor girl, she find, but all too late, That happiness depends not upon state; Or droop to earth, like some transplanted flower, A victim to the largeness of her dower, So she but leave a scion of the line, Her sire content bows to the âwill divineâ; Comforts himself with consolation trite; Gravely remarks âwhatever is is rightâ; Marks the long train of carriages file by (Their emptiness the type of sympathy), While the proud marble, doomed her dust to hide, Perpetuates his folly and his pride. Pshaw! I turn chatterer, and all to prove That pride and birth are enemies to love; But when yon youth weds with a lowly bride, I shall believe in all I have denied.â XLVIII. He ceased with shrill and mocking laugh, And triumph in his eye, As round the room he boldly looked For one who should reply; The Spirit of âthe Bookâ remained, But deigned no further word, Though, from his steadfast, meaning look, Contempt might be inferred; The Church's servants, as was fit, Their sacred armour don, And only differ as to who Shall lead their forces on. XLIX. Each spirit with humility Yields to his abler friend; Each fears he may not worthily The sacred cause defend; The Papist to the Lutheran Politely gives the âpas,â Alleging that the modern church Is better read by far; Till, one by one, they cease to speak, And there remain but two; One of whom shortly bows, and says, âMy Lord! I yield to you.â L. Forth from his place, with unctuous grace, A prelate's spirit stepped (Where in this world of flesh and blood Have Bishop's spirits crept? Their functions so restricted are, Their acts so doubtful seem, Their revenues their only care, Some wicked scorners deem). With look that claimed attention, A slight pause for effect, He thus addressed the Infidel And all his carping sect. THE SPIRIT OF EPISCOPACY. âExcuse me, my dear brethren, I really cannot hear, Without replying to them, These strictures on a âpeerâ; The more so when I recollect That the race does not boast Its share of representatives In Literature's host; But, granting that in this one field Their talent does not shine, Yet wisdom takes another form In the ennobled line. True there are bright exceptions To this exclusion wide; But they, I fear, are more inclined To take the other side; Nor indeed, were it otherwise, Would they exactly be Fit champions or fair judges In this controversy: Therefore, as a Lord Spiritual, Permit me to defend The Peerage from the onslaught Indulged in by our friend. Dismiss, I would entreat you all, Suspicion from your minds, That undue partiality My sense of justice blinds. My latter days were passed, 'tis true, Amongst the titled race; But tutor, curate, pamphleteer, Were steps to my high place; And I may be presumed to have The feelings of a man Who has been poor, and then has soared As high as Churchman can. I protest against the doctrine, That by the nobly born The feelings of humanity Are held in utter scorn; That pride of birth can influence The nature of the man; That feel as other mortals do, No noble ever can. These false assertions I deny! Nay, more, I trust to show. That all the glory of this isle We to the Peerage owe. On foreign nations cast an eye, Or listen to the tales Of our gay friend âthe daily press,â Who, certes, never fails To show us how affairs go on Throughout this planet's span: Most other countries, more or less, Show man opposed to man. Take France, which for some evenings past Has been our nightly theme, How startling the accounts we hear, How wild, how like a dream! Yet our friend piles up proof on proof, And I am free to own, That, as a mirror of the age, The British press alone Reflects correctly the world's pranks. In my time it was not So unassailable as now, So free from the foul blot Of truckling to the âpowers that be.â Take France, where I maintain All would be peace and harmony, But that the social chain Has lost its strongest, noblest link, The shackle which connects All interests in a common bond, And reconciles all sects. A throne by peers surrounded, Shows like some temple fair, Its nice proportions standing out Against the ambient air: Approach it nearer, 'twill be found That all the weight is borne By graceful columns, which sustain, No less than they adorn. Destroy these pillars, and the dome, Which lately touched the skies, Falls headlong from its airy height, Never again to rise. If then the peerage, as a race, Serves to uphold the fane, 'Twere madness to destroy a prop We ne'er can raise again. But I, from ancient habit, To politics have given More time than I intended; A touch of the old leaven Clings to us all! and my design At present is to show That peers pass through some trials Which others never know. E'en from the cradle are they not Assailed on every hand By flattery, whose silver tongue Few mortals can withstand? Grown older, their temptations Are harder to be borne; Should flattery fail the tempter, Sly ridicule and scorn Finish the work, and in the end, All trace of good destroy, The victim old in sin's career, Although in years a boy: Until, the reign of folly past, Reason assumes her sway; Pleasure to sterner duty yields; Conviction tears away The veil which hid reality. The being who but now Rushed blindly on in pleasure's train, Impelled by passion's glow, Assumes the post of duty, Stops in his wild career, Emerges from his fallen state A Patriot and a Peer! Who, in the realm of England, Is foremost in the van, When charity's soft, plaintive voice Pleads for his fellow man? Who, but some noble of the land? Nor do his efforts end With a mere gift; in other ways He proves himself a friend,â Descends from his high station, Adds voice to heart and hand, A martyr to his duty's call At charity's command. Who aids the worn and struggling man To run his race anew, In climes where hope's bright rainbow, With tints of rosy hue, Gladdens the exile's prospect, And shows him, that though here, He may have quaffed of sorrow's cup In his long dull career; That happiness is possible; That there is yet a goal; A path wherein to run his race; A purpose for his soul? The arts, without their fostering care, Would languish and decay; Science stop short in her career, All taste would melt away; The poet and the painter, Lacking a patron's smile, Would heap their choicest treasures up To form a funeral pile; While music, lending her last notes, To mourn her sisters fair, Would headlong rush into the flames, A victim to despair. And when, for a short space released From senatorial cares, He, with his humbler tenants, His well-earned leisure shares; Shows agriculture's richest spoils; His beasts of choicest sort; The secret of success imparts; Or, in his turn, is taught; Proud to be termed the âFarmer's Friendâ; In his ancestral hall, The simple country gentleman, Beloved, revered by all. I could say more in their behalf; I trust that I have shown Their errors are Society's, Their virtues all their own. Excuse this long defence; My sense of truth and right Has made me trespass on you At such a length to-night.â LI. But short the silence which prevailed, When, as by one consent, A thousand voices chorussed A shout of non-content; A thousand mocking gibes were heard, But, above all the din, A loud and pompous voice exclaimedâ âMy lord, it were a sin, A grovelling fault, an infamy, In me to sit and hear That, as an author, I have been Indebted to a peer For patronage. Did I not stand Amidst a motley crew Of lacqueys and of sycophants Unnoticed? It is true That when my work was known Amongst the truly great, The peer, amongst whose minions I had been forced to wait, Drawled out his hackneyed compliment; But he who is inclined To be considered learning's friend, Must be the first to find The merits of an author's work, Must take him by the hand, Do battle with detraction, And Envy's host withstand. Let others answer for themselves, Experience bids me say, That patrons wait upon success, But seldom lead the way.â LII. Hereon a pale and earnest sprite From a dark nook leaped forth; The spirits' perfect silence proved Their knowledge of his worth. Or it may be that no one cared To venture within reach Of one who rather trespassed on The courtesies of speech. He looked around, but as his glance No rival could detect, He to the courtly prelate spoke Something to this effect. SPIRIT OF SATIRE. âAn author's troubles end with his success, The constant soul can soar above distress; But slights and scorn let those forget who will, I felt them once, nay, more, they rankle still. Heaven protect me from my friends, say I, And let me wrestle with mine enemy. I with your lordship heartily agree In all you've said of young nobility, Though I much doubt if lordly virtue's praise Had so inspired you in your curate days; Or if, as tutor, your admiring eyes Followed some lordling lout's absurdities. Forget the bench, be tutor yet once more, Think of the petty insults which of yore Your poverty provoked. Enter the gate Where powdered minions of the âlordly greatâ Ape the insulting airs that are displayed Before their dazzled sight, and, I'm afraid, When your mind's eye, in retrospective scan, Reviews the insults heaped upon the man, You'll blush to think that you have stooped to sound The trump of praise upon such hollow ground. You say that every charity affords A list of names preceded by a lord's. Oh, my dear Bishop, surely you intend To laugh to scorn some charitable friend! What lurking pride beneath a vain pretence; What needless insult this to common sense; My lord, kind soul, presides at weekly board; Amazing condescension in a Lord! So deem the vulgar; but he takes good care, In patronage, to have the lion's share; Contrives to find a matron who will deign O'er fallen Magdalens to blandly reign. Thrusts in some pampered menial, who could Clear up some mystery little understood. This, aye, and more than this; yet you pretend A lord is charity's most earnest friend; Cant, cant, my lord, pure cant, or, what is worse, A mean device to save his lordship's purse. Many a man who'd almost skin a flint, Will spare a guinea to appear in print; And he who first made public the long roll Of patrons' names, be sure was not a fool. Why hide the candle 'neath a bushel's shade? Thus pride and charity each other aid: Good springs from evil; and a noxious root Yields, in the end, a good and wholesome fruit. I know no piece of trickery which surpasses The sops you've thrown out to âthe dangerous classesâ; You've kept the grain, and charitably sent The chaff to those for whom the whole was meant. Your emigration schemes might well be christened, âA plan by which the poor rates may be lessened.â Your âScripture readersâ and your âragged schoolsâ Hoodwink the eyes of surface-scanning fools, But not the victims of your pious cares. At their right price they rate your paltry wares; Dost think that âScripture readersâ will suffice To banish from its haunts deep-seated vice? Sickness and sin, in one thing, are alike; The leech's remedy must boldly strike The root of all the evil; this once known, Vice, like disease, perchance, may be o'erthrown. Deem you the poor will waste respect or thanks On some smug âmisterâ raised from their own ranks, Or bear the intrusion of a lynx-eyed spy, Cloaked in the garb of hireling piety? Never! though on his glib and oily tongue A rector's, nay a bishop's accents, hung. Useless with them is this well-meant deceit; The âpriestâ they'll honour, but they'll mob the cheat. And though disease and ghastly fever lie Straight in the channel of his ministry, The priest who wishes to reclaim the poor Must hold his path, though Death were at the door. Upon my word, my lord, on emigration Your eloquence commands my admiration. Truly the poor man's prospect is but small, Bounded all ways by some huge âunionâ wall; And doubtless he is wise to cross the sea, If, by so doing, he finds a remedy 'Gainst Poverty's hard grasp, or what is worse, The fears attendant on an empty purse. But recollect that all this pith and sinew Is so much loss of the best stuff that's in you; And I suspect the day is not far distant When England's attitude must be resistent. Britain will yet with tears of shame deplore Her rich so rich, her poor so very poor! When by some spurious Attila o'errun, She learns the value of each sturdy son; In vain will she regret the hardy race Who the lone terrors of the desert face, Sooner than stoop to share the paltry dole, Which feeds the body while it starves the soul. England is viewed abroad with jaundiced eyes, And little loved in her own colonies. What peers with science have to do, I own, In all humility, is to me unknown. True Worcester's marquis gave the world a scheme, Since brought to bear by others, upon steam. But the exception only serves to show That science is considered somewhat low. Sculpture and painting will not wholly die, E'en if neglected by nobility; Some âcunning Isaac,â doubtless, will be found Who, scouting all ideas of classic ground, Will add to our collection, when he hears How well a noble sold his pilfered wares; And, far from any fear of Painting's wane, To me this fact is tolerably plain; Though the old masters bear away the prize, And are, by judges, lauded to the skies, The modern men may hope to have their turn When future ages shall their merits learn. Music's decline your lordship seems to dread; Music in England is already dead, Dead of starvation, and her place supplied With music by our neighbours duly tried; Then, with its artistes, opera, ballet, all, Sent secondhand to charm our capital. The ancestral hall, at which your lordship glances, Is surely gleaned from some old world romances: A dream of condescension well enough For churchmen's arguments, but wretched stuff In eyes of worldlings. Doubtless, now and then, A lord does deign to herd with meaner men; Nay, e'en her ladyship can condescend To drop her dignity and play the friend. But when such great humility you find, You may be sure that something lurks behind: Perhaps a new election is at handâ At such times peers are wonderfully bland,â And my lord owes it to his name and station To put his second son in nomination. The family borough is, of course, the heir's, To start in opposition no one dares; And, if the younger can achieve the county, He may hope something from the Premier's bounty. The âcommons houseâ sounds odd upon the ears Crammed, as we know it is, with sucking peers. Who calls peers proud? Do they not always try To enlist the rich untitled, who might vie With them successfully? Are they not ever ready To receive an heiress, or bestow âmy ladyâ? A sort of moral whirlpool is the peerage, A rich craft near it must beware her steerage; At first, half drunk, she reels in outer eddies; But, if well freighted, gradually steadies, Narrows her circleânear and nearer draws, And falls at length into the monster's jaws. Who calls peers proud? Not I; for I have seen These very nobles bow before a queen. 'Tis but their duty you will say; but I Do not allude at all to Royalty. I mean the Queen of Spades, whose charming manners Drew England's chivalry beneath her banners; And whose good man's successful speculation Engaged the attention of the entire nation. Now, my good lord, I beg you'll understand Why I thus blame the magnates of the land. Were all their follies kept in their own class, Wise men might be content to let them pass; But (here's the mischief) all the minor fools Ape at a distance fashion's tinsel rules. But shall the vices of the baser brood, Scathless, escape the impartial censor's rod? Amongst the class commercial we shall find Those faults which most proclaim a want of mind. Pride, avarice, and meanness are the sins Hugged to their hearts, by London's citizens. Had I the power, their statue of the duke No longer should be clothed in city smoke; But, on its site, a figure should appear Much better suited to the atmosphere. A civic group, or allegory witty; Or better still, âthe Genius of the City, Some well known Plutus, holding up on high A giant purse, which would attract each eye. Kneeling before him, bowed with awe and fear, A group of Mammon's worshippers appear. Behind him, scowling hideously, might stand Hatred and venomed Malice, hand in hand: Whilst Envy, with her eyes fixed on the purse, In act to spring, should seem to mouth a curse. Dead at his feet a fleshless beggar might, By contrast, aid its towering opposite. A group like this, methinks, would really be Well worthy citizens' idolatry. Their god, raised high, its worshippers might see; To whom, in passing, they might bow the knee; If lower still their eyes they chanced to turn, Their deity's attendants they would learn: Thus, on their mood dependent, bull and bear Might read a sermon, or repeat a prayer. This should be placed where âmen of businessâ pass, The base of granite, and the figure brass. The vices of the men of low estate Ought to be charged upon the rich and great. Virtue will scarcely flourish in the âdenâ Which forms the nightly refuge of poor men. Outward associations, more or less, Upon the mind a certain stamp impress. A plant, deprived of wholesome light and air, Droops to its mother earth in mute despair; No modest bud bursts forth in beauty bright, No dazzling flower charms the sense of sight; Life struggles feebly on, till winter's breath Ends its long agony by welcome death. And what is virtue but a goodly plant, Which cannot thrive in misery and want? It must be planted in a generous earth; Needs care and culture from its very birth; As it grows up, it must be trained with care; Or all precautions unavailing are: The kindly dew, descending from above, Moistening its rootâthe gentle ray of love, Effulgent beaming, usher into day A flower that knows no touch of time's decay. Cowards! and hypocrites! how self-love prevailed When ghastly pestilence your ranks assailed! What schemes were started to relieve the poor! Then those were generous who ne'er gave before. âYou breed diseases,â the physician cried, âWhile air and light are to the poor denied;â âWater!â Hygeia shrieks, but at the cry Up springs the Hydra of monopoly. âClose your foul Golgothas,â shouts common sense; âOur fees!â exclaim the clergy in defence. Thus year succeeds to year, meanwhile the poor Are leftâexactly where they were before. Oh, England! land of freedom and the free! When will you understand true charity? When will you learn that her own children are The fittest objects of a country's care?â THE SPIRIT OF LAW. âEnough! enough!â exclaimed an angry voice, âThe court has nothing left it but the choice Between two courses; either to adjourn, Or to the subject of debate return. Counsel have touched on all things 'neath the sun; The sole exception being the very one On which our judgment's prayed. This much is clear: That evidence is sadly wanting here. Plaintiff declares, that could this mortal see The consequences of his villainy, (Presumptive villainy, for this may prove A very proper legal sort of love), He would persist in his unrighteous plot. Defendant's answer states that he would not. An issue must be tried before the court Whose practice reaches actions of the sort: The âSpirits of the Nightâ must try the case; They have the power, before his eyes, to place A dream, in colours so distinct and bright, That long years seem to centre in a night. Let him be shown the ruin that awaits The hapless victim of seduction's baits. If, warned by this, he turn to virtue's side, Deaf to the promptings both of lust and pride, The sacred volume must be held to be A mortal soul's securest panoply. Leave we the trial to Night's potent spirits; The case must rest on its intrinsic merits.â This sentence uttered, by one impulse fired, Behind his charge each guardian sprite retired. Darkness again prevailed for some short space Till (their bright eyes illumining the place), Flitting around the youth, now here, now there. Two spirits of another kind appear. 'Twere past the limner's subtle art, I ween, To represent these actors in the scene; Shape, outline, feature, change before the eye Has time to subject them to scrutiny; Nay, ere the sight can telegraph the brain Its mirrored picture, all has changed again. Yet each appears to exercise his art In his own place: the one upon the heart, Makes, with transparent finger, certain signs, The other to the head his care confines. Now heart, now head, is victor in the strife: His dream was an epitome of life. END OF THE FIRST CANTO. CANTO SECOND. THE DREAM. ARGUMENT. The lover's retreatâLove's deliriumâThe changeâSocietyâ The guestsâThe heiressâMusic; its attributesâThe governessâ The danceâThe evening at seaâThe ruined castleâThe youth surrounded by his companionsâThe betrothedâThe refusalâ The bridgeâThe victimâThe lost one's taleâWaking reflections. I. Again before his ravished eyes The beauteous maiden stood; Oh! she had ne'er appeared so fair, So worthy to be wooed. Her cheeks, with constant blushes warm; Her large and liquid eyes; Two seas of tenderness, in which A world of promise lies; Yielding, affectionate, and kind, No frown o'erclouds that face, As with a soul-revealing sigh She sinks in his embrace. II. He clasps her to his beating heart, Which guilty passions swell; With fiery eloquence he pleads, And pleads, alas! too well. That night, with quick and timid step, She leaves her peaceful home, Trusts to the tempter's promises, And firmly seals her doom. Bewildered, wavering, hoping, She quits her native dale: Thus perjury wins virtue's self, Thus arts of hell prevail. III. He bore her to her future home, So deemed the partial maid; He fondly calmed the rising fears Of her he had betrayed. While she, too willing to believe His trust-inspiring lies, Regarded every act of his With love's o'er-partial eyes; And often, when a struggling doubt Would into being start, Took shame unto herself to nurse Suspicion in her heart. IV. It scarce were possible for love To find a meeter spot; Embosomed in a mountain's side Peeped forth a tiny cot, Far from the busy haunts of men, Where the romantic Wye Pursues its infant babbling course In nature's minstrelsie: A wood encircled jealously, A ruin watched above, Lest some rude mortal should invade This sanctuary of love. V. Here, in an atmosphere of bliss, Reposed the youthful pair, Too wrapped in love's delicious trance To heed the frown of care; Though, ever and anon would pass Across her speaking eyes A transient shade of sadness; A gentle sigh would rise, But to be stifled on her lips By passion's warm caress, Or echoed back reproachfully With glance of mute distress. VI. Oft on the streamlet's verdant banks Their truant footsteps stray; Heedless of Time's too rapid flight, Till the declining day, Lengthening the mountain shadow, With giant finger shows, That nature is about to hush The world to its repose. While the bright coronet of gold, That crowns the mountain's crest, Looks like the fond sun's parting gift, Ere yet he sinks to rest. VII. Together oft they watch the sun Descend the mountain's side, More lovely in his soft decline Than in his noonday pride. So beauty in its zenith height Doth dazzle and amaze; Its bright effulgence overpowers, Nor suffers us to gaze; But, in its mellower season, A thousand charms appear, As mind conspires with loveliness To render it more dear. VIII. Fie, youth! inconstant trifler, fie! The treasure of to-day Too soon to suffer cold neglect, To experience love's decay; Exacting, jealous, passionate, Should aught thy fancy thwart, Callous, cruel, and unfeeling, To her whose gentle heart Has once confessed its vassalage. 'Tis sad, alas! but true; Not only dost thou tyrant prove, But thou art traitor too. IX. A few months o'er (how swift they flew With her that lady fair) Produced a gradual change in him, Which filled her with despair. He who, but some short weeks gone by, Had known no higher joy, Than with his loved one's tresses Continually to toy, Now counts each hour of the day, Each minute of the hour, And finds time lag but wearily, E'en in his lady's bower. X. Full soon he seeks the neighbouring town, Joins in its pleasures rude, Unable to appreciate The sweets of solitude: Cloyed with possession (once so prized), He in his victim sees Naught but a jealous guardian, Whose charms have ceased to please. His now so frequent absence Is easier to be borne, Than that thin-wove hypocrisy, Which scarce conceals its scorn. XI. Too well she saw the cruel change In his averted eye; And oh! the misery of that hour, The damning agony. The brain refused its functionâ No! she would not believe That he, the idol of her soul, Could wantonly deceive; And yet she shuddered inwardly, When venturing to compare His former fond devotedness With his now altered air. XII. Why should we trace the death of love, As slowly it declines, The soul's sad sickness under which Misguided woman pines; When, love's illusion o'er, she finds That she has yielded all To one whose false and tinsel flame Has scarce survived her fall? Why wonder that the dastard blow, Which hurls her from her throne, Should turn her honey into gall, Her heart to hardest stone? XIII. Yet must she smile, tremendous task! The martyr's at the stake Is child's play in comparison! Oh! that the heart would break, And not survive its happiness, Nor linger at death's door; Its cherished freight a total wreck On the world's iron shore! A prey to all the waves of fate, The hissing winds of scorn, Which blow so keenly upon one Left helpless and forlorn! XIV. Quit we the sad, the sickening theme: The mortal who descends To practise thus on confidence For his own selfish ends, Merits more deep damnation, Deserves more hissing scorn, Than the red murderer for whom The depths of vengeance yawn. He kills by foulest treachery, Uproots the fairest flower, Who blights a maiden's innocence, Her best, her richest dower. XV. The scene is shifted suddenly. He finds himself among The votaries of fashion's shrine, A bright and brilliant throng; Grouped gracefully, yet carelessly, A large saloon displays A well assorted company; The man of former days Chats with the ruddy schoolboy, Well up in cricket's game, And sighs to find himself so changed, The world so much the same. XVI. Women of every age are there; The dowager whose dÃ©bÃ»t Had charmed the courtly group, while yet This century was new, Half buried in a couch reclines In most luxurious ease, A couch whose soft persuasive shape A Sybarite might please; The matron and the blushing bride, Maidens of every time, The young, the old, those who are in, And those long past their prime. XVII. E'en happy childhood strikes the eye, Or rather strikes the ear, Showing its whereabouts with laugh So natural and clear; Those tresses which, an hour ago, Were not a hair awry, Now, in disorder scattered, In rich confusion lie. How beautiful that rosy tint, How bright those laughing eyes, Which mirror each emotion's play, And scorn to use disguise. XVIII. Apart from the more noisy guests, With grave and solemn mien, Deep in its silent mysteries, Whist's worshippers are seen: That man with lofty forehead Intent upon the cards, The destinies of states controls, And England's honour guards; Leaving kings, queens, ambassadors, And diplomatic scuffles, Their pasteboard representatives He cavalierly shuffles. XIX. There is young Kidglove of the âGreens,â Who joined the ranks of Mars, Seduced by the gay uniform, But never dreamt of wars; His field duties attendance At picnics and excursions; His laurels won at âFÃªtes ChampÃªtres,â Or similar diversions. The ball room proves his tactics; Here his polite attention And simpering smile obtain âMost honourable mention.â XX. That is young Highflier, than whom No jockey is more able, More skilled in the âarcanaâ Of betting ring and stable; Who votes all this thing slow, And wonders what one can see In music or in dancing To take a fellow's fancy. Give him his horses and his dogs, His betting book and tandem, He'll leave all bothering parties To those who understand them. XXI. There is a living duke; Oily, the favourite preacher; Longlocks, the boudoir poet, A dear delightful creature; Puzzle'm, the Cantab don, That intellectual giant, Challenging wordy warfare, With look and eye defiant. These all have toadies in their train, For social life is cumbered, Just like the vegetable world, With parasites unnumbered. XXII. These simper acquiescence Whene'er, by careful gleaning, They manage haply to make out, Or guess his grace's meaning; The parson's exposition Receives a due ovation; The poet's vanity is soothed By a well-aimed quotation; The don propound's a theory With loud and pompous diction, And deems the silence that ensues The offspring of conviction. XXIII. There are the lesser satellites, The squires and their ladies; The doctor and the lawyer; But no one who in trade is. These form a group apart, And seek, with furtive glances, To catch the great man's eye When he perchance advances. There is a curate whose small pay I hardly like to mention, Though how he manages to live Is past my comprehension. XXIV. And then the PhÅnix of the night An heiress, to whom rumour So fabulous a fortune gave, That it appeared to doom her To single blessedness at once; No settlements could offer A sum at all proportionate To that which filled her coffer. And what was stranger than all this, Oh, union most uncommon! Nature in her fair person tried To form a perfect woman. XXV. Hers was the poetry of form, That grace so rarely seen, The soft voluptuous outline Of Paphia's peerless queen, But breathing, virginal, untouched By sorrow or by sin, Warmed by a heart that lighted up The mansion from within: Her ivory throat a pillar meet For the small classic head; While love and virtue round her Their holiest incense shed. XXVI. The sculptor in her perfect form His own ideal saw; Her presence on earth's coarser clay Inspired a sense of awe; The faultless beauty of her face Was heightened by the mind, Which lent each feature eloquence, And happily combined The mental with the physical; Her dark and lustrous eyes Flash brightly, or cloud languidly, As various feelings rise. XXVII. Yet oftentimes would those ripe lips Give passage to a sigh; Those eyes would brilliant drops distil, When, in her privacy, She thought upon her orphan state, Longed for a parent's kiss; Fortune, so lavish otherwise, Had been unkind in this. E'en in the midst of pleasure's train She felt herself alone; And loneliness has pangs for which No fortune can atone. XXVIII. Calm, self-possessed, and quiet, And yet withal as free From sick'ning affectation As from idle vanity, No studied effort marred the effect Her matchless beauty caused. Hushed by her voice's Siren tones Men in their converse paused, Fearing to lose a single word; And when she ceased to speak Were silent, till their silence brought The blush to her fair cheek. XXIX. Oh, charm, to which e'en beauty yields! Can aught on earth so stir The soul's most secret feeling, as The dulcet tones of her To whom benignant nature Has, in her bounty, given Her daintiest gift, âa soft, sweet voice,â That attribute of heaven? Oh, doubly, trebly armed is she; No heart so hard but owns A mute responsive echo To woman's 'witching tones. XXX. At the first summons, to her harp She moves with nymphlike grace; The muse of harmony in her Might truant fancy trace. She sweeps the chords, the thrilling notes Her breast's deep feelings prove; Now a soft melting cadence shows A soul attuned to love: The wrapt and listening heart, Almost too hushed to beat, Approaches by degrees the goal Where pain and pleasure meet. XXXI. Oh, Music! would I had the skill To worthily rehearse Thy deep and soul-felt beauties In due and fitting verse. Oh, lofty theme, alas! too high, How sing thee as I ought: Thou eldest born of heaven! Thou foster nurse of thought! Awaking in the heart of man All that is great and grand, Thou raisest him to that bright arch By which the world is spanned. XXXII. Thou emanation from above! Thou hast the power to change The hard and stubborn heart of man; To extend the narrow range Of mental vision: fanned by thee, Nature's warm feelings glow; At thy sweet summons, from our eyes The tears of pity flow. Our hearths, our country, all, Seem more than ever dear, As music's wild exciting strain Falls on a freeman's ear. XXXIII. How oft thy magic strains recall The visions of the past, Memories which o'er the chastened soul A holy sorrow cast; Thou callest up departed friends, Eclipsed by death's dark night; Raised for a moment by thy power, They flash before the sight; And as thy glorious notes ascend, Bearing our thoughts on high, Thou aidest faith and hope to prove Man's immortality. XXXIV. Thou speakest every tongue on earth, Or rather, all mankind Interpret that sweet language Which whispers to the mind; To thy voice every heart responds, All worship at thy shrine, However rude the offering be, Thou mightiest of the Nine! In the full womb of coming time, Methinks I view in thee A link to join in bonds of love The human family. XXXV. Sweet muse of harmony, forgive: Thou, whom the heaven-born few Have striven emulously to sing, Accept my tribute too, Humble but heart-felt offering; To none on earth I yield In admiration of thy charms, Else had I left the field To loftier spirits; yet, O muse, Let me essay to swell The world-wide chorus of the praise Thou meritest so well. XXXVI. She ceased her strain, and every eye Upon the Siren turned, Each lip o'erflowed with flattery, Each breast with pleasure burned; As turning with a native grace She bowed her thanks and smiled Upon the partner of her task, A creature meek and mild, Whom none appeared to notice, Whom all passed coldly by, Or paid her salutation back With chilling courtesy. XXXVII. Not so the lady of the harp. In kind and earnest tones She thanks her sister melodist, And half the praise disowns; Throws on that slighted being Some portion of the rays Which gild a high-born station In these birth-loving days; Eschews all airs of patronage, And with true woman's art Seeks not to dazzle or amaze, But aims to touch the heart. XXXVIII. Nor hard the task; for her sweet smile Had thawed the veriest churl That ever frowned on happiness: But on a friendless girl, More lonely in society Than in her cheerless room, Where, in the twin companionship Of solitude and gloom, Her tears at least were free to flow, On her such kindness wrought A cure for half the paltry slights Of which she was the sport. XXXIX. Hardest of fates! too hard, alas! Tuition's wages are Insult, neglect, ingratitude, A life of constant care, A goading apprehension Of long prospective want, An absence of all sympathy, A nauseous flood of cant, A menial's wages, nay, far less; This will ye surely find, Ye who aspire to teach the young, To train the immortal mind. XL. Our youth essays to share the smile Of her whom all admire; His winning manners in her heart A preference inspire: In shortest space he feels as though He spoke to one long known; Their conversation soon assumes A soft, familiar tone. Thoughts, sentiments, opinions, So happily agree, Each in the other's nature can A kindred spirit see. XLI. Now in the mazy dance her form Is circled by his arms; Now some responsive smile gives birth To captious love's alarms; Or, turned on him a moment, A thrilling glance conveys A world of meaning, and all sense Of jealousy allaysâ A glance whose rapid eloquence Outstrips the speed of thought, The electric current of the soul By kindred spirit caught. XLII. Anon upon a vessel's deck, Skimming the moonlit sea, The yielding form of her he loves Encircled lovingly; The Orb of Night, with lustre mild, Lights up the fairy scene, Suggesting to the heart of man All that he might have been, Or trusts to be hereafter. Oh, radiant Queen of Night! Why are thy soft and silvery beams So grateful to the sight? XLIII. Is it that thou with pitying look Regardest all below, And dost not seek too cunningly Our hidden deeds to know? Unlike that orb whose searching rays, Darting through smallest space, Plainly before the conscious mind Each imperfection place. The sun, a stern and upright judge, With clear, all-seeing eye, While thou seest nought that haply might Outrage thy purity. XLIV. Fraught with love's silent eloquence, Their humid eyes discourse; A single word were treason now; The softest voice is hoarse When it disturbs that holy pause Which tired nature makes, That hour when, scorning the dull earth, The soul of man awakes. The vessel slumbers on the wave, E'en the rough seaman feels The dreamy influence of the charm Which o'er the senses steals. XLV. Hark! it is surely fancy. No; Again I hear that strain; Borne on the idle wind it floats Across the moonlit main; A sound of blended voices, That charms the listening ear; Now fading into silence, now Melodiously clear; Keeping responsive echo Unto the dipping oar, A joyous party slowly gains The scarce-distinguished shore. XLVI. O Nature! how mysterious, How wonderful art thou! Before thy rich simplicity Art's noblest triumphs bow. How sweetly doth the human voice In mellow cadence fall: What tone from pealing organ sent Can the hushed soul enthral As chorus of sweet voices, Attuned by Nature's power, Sweeping in concert o'er the deep, At evening's stilly hour? XLVII. Now in an ivy-mantled tower, Whose ruined walls attest The march of that relentless foe Whose labours know no rest; A ruined hearth proclaims the spot Where erst a noble sat, And entertained a haughty queen In all the pride of state: So mighty then, so lowly now, No sermon can convey More wholesome moral than the thought Of grandeur passed away. XLVIII. Amongst his youthful compeers next He stands with conscious air, The acknowledged winner of the prize, The favoured of the fair; Such various charms, such wondrous wealth, So many smiling friends, Rarely indeed the fickle dame Such store of favours sends. Ah! youth, beware: a smiling face Oft like a mask conceals More venom than the deadliest scowl Which enmity reveals. XLIX. And now at evening's tranquil hour, That hour to lovers dear, E'en though its darkening shadows show The parting moment near. Too cruel Time! relentless foe! Nor youth nor beauty may Arrest thy hurrying progress, Obtain the least delay; Oh, couldst thou know but half the pangs Which youthful lovers feel When forced to part, lip pressed to lip, Their sad âgood-nightâ they seal. L. âGood-night, good-night!â repeats the youth, âGood-night!â responds the maid; Until from sight he is shut out By night's too jealous shade. âTo-morrow's sun will smile upon Your oft repeated vow; Yet two days more a bridal wreath Will crown that lovely brow.â Presumptuous mortal! thou art blind, Short-sighted one, can'st see, E'en for a moment, through the gloom, Which veils futurity? LI. 'Tis eve: the youth, with youth's hot haste, Quickens his courser's flight; Between him and his happiness There intervenes a night. What fancies dance through that young brain! What airy visions rise! His panting servant finds it hard To follow as he flies; The gate is reached; the grinning hind Has scarce the latch let fall, Ere he, with passion's fiery haste, Has gained the stately hall. LII. He entered quickly where so oft A clamorous welcome hailed The arrival of the expected one; Sudden his conscience quailed. The guardian of the heiress played The ceremonious host: All was polite but chilling, Good breeding's glistening frost; The loved one absent? why this change? This cold reception, why? Wouldst know the reason? search awhile Thy treacherous memory. LIII. Sudden the door was opened wide, And entering was seen His promised bride, so cold, so pale, She looked like sorrow's queen; But not with sorrow's bending port, For pride's sustaining power, Backed by her conscious rectitude, Had nerved her for this hour. She bent her head with haughty grace, As with a swelling breast, Scorn darting from her eyes the while, She thus the youth addressed. THE BETROTHED (SPEAKS). âMy lord! I trust you will not deem that I Am swayed by whim, or girlish phantasy, In what I have to say: I would entreat, You will not let an empty phantom cheat Your hopes so far. I were indeed to blame, If I permitted a false sense of shame To turn me from what I consider right; Else, had I gladly shunned my task to-night. Dream not that whispered malice has the power, In my esteem, a valued friend to lower. Scandal I loathe, but I were mad indeed To friendly caution to refuse all heed; Or treat with incredulity a tale, Whose sad relation caused my soul to quail; A tale in which you played so black a part (Though I believed you guiltless in my heart), That it was due to me, no less than you, To prove the accusation was untrue. Need I say more? my efforts failed; and why? Too deep, too patent, was your infamy. I might have left to fitter lips than mine The task of stating why I now decline The honour, which you kindly would confer On my unworthy self. I know I err Against âthe tyrant customâ; but with me Candour and truth outweigh propriety. My lord! I own I gave a full assent To your attentionsânay, was well content To trust my fate to one who seemed to me, In heart and feelings, all that man should be. I saw the mind reflected in the face, Where, foolish girl, I dreamt that I could trace A thousand signs of truth's ingenuous grace. To such a being I engaged my hand; Not to a serpent who had coldly plann'd The ruin of a young and trusting heart By foulest treachery and basest art; Who, after heaping on her wretched head The worst of insults, like a coward fled. Little I guessed, forsooth, that every smile Was stolen from the victim of your guile; And I a party to the theftâpoor fool! I was too vain to deem myself a tool. But I forget my purpose: I am wrong In giving this wide license to my tongue. Enough that I refuse a rank to share, Enough that I disdain a name to bear, Which have been sullied by such acts as prove Their owner quite unworthy of my love. Farewell, my lord! and may that power, who Absolves our sins, show mercy unto you. Your wanton crime compels me thus to sever Our promis'd bondâmy lord, adieu for ever!â LIV. The outraged fair one quits the scene, Nor does the culprit dare To offer words in his defence: Rage, phrenzy, and despair, Tug at his heart-strings with such force, That when at length he speaks, His voice is less like speech divine, Than some hoarse raven's shrieks: Too late the guilty youth would fain Be cleansed from vice's slime; Too late perceives that vengeance treads Upon the heels of crime. LV. The host, in mercy to his state, Entreats him to be calm; His wild and haggard air excite To pity and alarm; But, with a curse upon his lips, The madman breaks away, Calls for his horse with stern command, That brooks of no delay; Nor waits he then, his angry mood Admits of nought like rest; He quits the hated spot ere one Can answer his behest. LVI. Alone, to the cool evening breeze He bares his fevered brow; Alas! that simple remedy Will not avail him now. Within his inmost heart of hearts The fire so fiercely burns; Conscience, so often thrust aside, With tenfold force returns; With cynic sneer he tries to drown His torment's sharp appeals; And with a fiend's philosophy His stubborn bosom steels. LVII. Bracing and cool, the thin night air; The young moon shed a ray, Which lightly tipped with silver edge A ruined tower that lay Flanking a noble river, Athwart whose channeled bed In dark uncertain outline Its threatening shadow spread: A time-touched bridge o'erspanned the stream, Whose gurgling waters strove To kiss the fabric's massive piers, While swiftly on they drove. LVIII. Upon this bridge the wilful youth A moment paused and sighed: Scarce two hours since and he had passed That spot elate with pride. But pride is quenched, and to its seat Far other feelings start; The promptings of the ready fiend Are busy at his heart: As o'er the peaceful stream he leans, Dark thoughts besiege his mind, Suggesting that beneath its waves He may oblivion find. LIX. But no! that triumph were too great, His proud heart scorns the thought, That he to coward suicide Should be impelled by aught. He hurries on; the centre reached, A shivering female stands, Intently gazing on the stream, Upraised her thin wan hands: His conscience pricks him onward, Prompts that he here may save Some wretch who seeks to cheat her cares Beneath the river's wave. LX. He speaks, and at his voice's sound, Two bright and dazzling eyes Flash with the sudden violence Of madness and surprise. A moment more she shrieks and falls. That shriek, so wild and shrill, Chills the warm current of his blood And nullifies his will; And coupled with it is his name! Amazed, in that pale face The victim of his heartless lust His eyes too surely trace. LXI. With outstretched hands he fain would raise That prostrate form; but, no! From his polluting touch she shrinks, As from her deadliest foe, Springs to her feet, and stands erect. Nay, in the moon's pale beam, Her figure, rigid with her scorn, Doth more than mortal seem; Her glaring eyes fixed full on his, Her face unearthly pale, Seduction's victim, in his ears Thus thunders forth her tale. THE LOST ONE'S TALE. âThou! can it be, or do my cheated eyes Behold some mocking fiend in human guise? No, 'tis himselfâthe tempterâit is he! The author of my shame, my misery; By whose false vows and perjured oaths I fell From virtue's height to vice's lowest hell; To whom my heart, my soul, my all was given; By whom to sin's abyss I have been driven; Who from a trusting girl her virtue stole, And, not content with that, must damn the soul; Who, pander like, made over to his friend The being whom he promised to defend, Treated his victim like a beast of price, And made a market of his very vice. Coward and villain! Could my state impart No touch of pity to thy stony heart? E'en though thou wert incapable of love, Could not humanity thy conscience move? Did not my unborn infant mutely plead For mercy to its mother in her need? Ah! do my words excite thy noble bile? Small care have I for either frown or smile. Wretch! demon! fiend! thou shalt not pass till I Have dinned the sequel of thy villainy Into those ears. Alas! full well I know That, past that sense, words will not, cannot go. But to my tale. When, craven like, you fled, I felt within my heart a secret dread; For a pure nature, once deceived, assumes Suspicion as an armour, and becomes Doubly suspicious. Oh, that dreadful night! How thankful was I when the morning light Cleared multiplying horrors from my brain, And gave my soul the power to hope again. The day dragged on; your friend arrived, and then I learned, with wonder, what mean things are men; Found that you nobly had arranged to sell Her whose sole fault was loving you too well. But he to whom you basely made me o'er, When he had heard my short sad story, swore That he would rather die than stoop to be A partner in such monstrous villainy. He was a man, and one in whose warm heart Vice was not linked with treachery and art: His vices on his soul but lightly sat; Yours are your own, deep-rooted and innate; You, by your flight, outraged each human tie, He showed your victim every sympathy. By his advice (may heaven reward his care! And acts like his, I feel, are treasured there) I sought my home, I dared to turn my face Towards him on whose grey hairs I'd brought disgraceâ My outraged father. Like a guilty thing I waited, till the night, with friendly wing, Shrouded my features in its close disguise, And hid my altered form from prying eyes. A cold and chilling mist, a driving rain Beat on my fevered brow, but beat in vain: I struggled on, uncertain, weary, worn, My soul a prey to doubt, my bosom torn By keenest anguish, while my wavering mind Now towards hope, and now to fear inclined. Wearied, at length I reached the well-known gate; The place to me seemed strangely desolate; No cheering light from latticed window shone; I strove to catch a soundâalas! no tone Of long familiar voices met my ear; I felt a wild, strange, melancholy fear Creep o'er me; while the damp and murky air, And death-like silence drove me to despair. At length, more bold, within the porch I stand, And seek admission with a faltering hand. But no replyâno signs of life appear; My beating heart the only sound I hear. Frantic, at last, with all my strength I try To attract some notice: in my agony I kneel upon the wet and reeking sod, And dare, in prayer, address my outraged God; My faltering orison yields no relief; Doubt adds its terrors to my bitter grief. Now round the farm I steal, and try to find Some sign to reassure my troubled mind: Fruitless my searchâin stable, barn, or stall; I visit each, but they are vacant all. In hopeless agony I turn from thence, A prey to all the horrors of suspense, Retrace my footsteps, and, with o'ercharged breast, Enter the village, hushed in midnight rest; Steal past each well-known porch with guilty fear, Longing to know the truth I dread to hear. Beyond the village, in a crazy shed, Lives a lone woman, whom her neighbours dread: At midnight hour, beneath the moon's pale shade, She culls the herbs which aid her baneful trade; With hellish art compounds decoctions foul (Poisons at once to body and to soul). At her approach the children cease to play, And e'en the rustic matrons steal away; Fearing her withering curse, the tired boor Quickens his sauntering pace when near her door. Through her dull casement a faint, glimmering light Falls like a ray of hope upon my sight; My fears are conquered, desperate I turn To her shunned porch, the dreaded truth to learn: I knock, and soon the hag, with accent sour, Demands my purpose at so late an hour; My name once heard, she opes her creaking door, And with quick eye my wasted face scans o'er; Then, taught mistrust by age, peers in my eyes, And mutters words of wonder and surprise; First bids me enter, in a sullen tone, Then cautiously secures her dwelling lone: Half dead with fear, a chair receives my frame; The crone meanwhile mouths o'er and o'er my name, As if the memory's maze, not all effaced, Required some clue by which it might be traced. Some minutes then she rocks her palsied head, My eyes the while survey the ruined shed. Herbs, once so green, now dried and withering lie, A fitting type of my sad destiny; Upon the hearth a low and smouldering flame, That gave nor light, nor heat, yet served to tame The raw, inclement air. A huge black cat Rubbed round the chair in which its mistress sat, Its large green eyes glared on me as it moved, Acting as sentry to the thing it loved. Scarce had I time these various signs to note, Ere words broke harshly from the witch's throat. âAh, dainty one,â she cried; âyou here! Yon boy Was like them all, soon tired of his toy. Ah, well! ah, well! I mind you ever were Different to all the sullen brutes down here; Your word was ever gentle, and I could, On your farm, gather sticks and rotten wood Without a curse, or else a snarling cur Let loose to force the devilish hag to stir. Ah, well! I'm grateful: now I never hear Aught but the muttered words of hate and fear. Your poor old fatherââ At that name I fell; In those few words I heard a parent's knell; The cottage swam before my dizzy brain, Long I lay senseless, till, recalled again By that lone woman's care, tearless I stood, And heard the fruits of my ingratitude. My father, from the hour of my flight, Ne'er looked, with conscious eye, on Heaven's light; Speechless and crippled, for some time he lay, His farm, the meanwhile, falling to decay; Till a harsh agent, and the law's fell fang, Finished the ruin which his child began. The parish-poorhouse gave its grudging care To him whose generous heart would ever share His meal with misery's child; not long was he An inmate of that home of poverty; That power who willed that he should not repine At my disgrace, or view his own decline, Freed his imprisoned soul from mortal clay, To again expand in heaven's unclounded day. Judge of my horror when I found that I Had added murder to my infamy; I used nor steel, nor drug, nor leaden ball, But a more fatal engine than them all, A child's ingratitude, that weapon sure To pierce a parent's bosom to the core. That fearful night passed like some hideous dream; I left the spot with morning's faintest gleam; The hag in vain spoke of the untimely hour; Whispered of certain drugs that have the power To outrage nature in her closest ties, And hide my open shame from prying eyes; Shuddering with horror, from this nest of sin I fleeâyet ere my wanderings begin, I seek the still churchyard, and try to trace, By the grey light, my father's resting place. That duty paid, my faltering steps I bend To that huge town whose vastness knows no end: The meanest lodging in its meanest street, Yet good enough for misery's retreat, Was mine;âhere, in due course of time, I pressed My ill-starred infant to my throbbing breast, In its embrace felt something like relief From my past suffering and gnawing grief; Yet did its sex foreboding thoughts employ; I should have felt less anxious with a boy; Dear bought experience made me shudder, when I thought on all the wiles and snares of men. But soon my fears assumed another form; Another subject filled me with alarm; My funds, which, guarded with a miser's care, Had served to keep me on a miser's fare, Were almost gone; yet did I not repine; One blessing still remained while health was mine; And I could work, and trusted to obtain Something by which I might a pittance gain: A willing mind, I had been taught to think, Could not to downright want untimely sink. Ah, cruel error! bitter, taunting lie! A seeming truthâa hollow fallacy! How oft, elate with hope, I left my home? How oft returned, with ill success o'ercome? What weary miles? what hours in waiting passed; But to be brutally refused at last; Or, if not that, offered so small a price, That e'en the very fiend of avarice Had blushed to name it; yet these vampires found Their sordid offers on substantial ground. They have, lynx-eyed, discovered, what might pass Less greedy mortals,âthat the lowest class Are not the poorestâthat the poor require, As labour's wage, bread, shelter, clothes, and fire. They see that there are thousands whose small gains Form, on the whole, a sum which ill maintains Those signs external, which, in worldly cant, Are termed appearances, and which to want Is sheer starvation. Many a female plies Her constant needle, dims her sparkling eyes, Her task, fools deem, to pass the time away; Nonsense! she works, like all the world, for pay, But living, as she does, at others' charge, She can, in this way, her mean wage enlarge; Saps her young life to make a false parade; Nor let the world suspect she is half paid. Thus does a fiendish selfishness contrive On others' misery to gaily live; And thus the very poorest of the poor Lay half their earnings at the rich man's door. Day after day I try, without success, To find employment. Oh, the bitterness Of that sad search! to see the living tide Press onward, all intent and occupied; To feel the will, the wish to fill a place, However small, in labour's busy race, And meet, at each attempt, a fresh rebuff, Tries a soul formed of nature's sternest stuff. One day, when near the end of my dull round, A written notice caused my heart to bound: Labour was wanted, it was work that I Had practised almost from my infancy; The finest cambric served not to suffice The wants of luxury; to enhance its price, The embroiderer's skill was needed; I applied, This time my meek request was not denied, Nay, was accepted; and my wondrous pay, By hardest work procured, twelvepence a day; Twelve hours' constant labour, but no food; Hot water, it is true, they did include; Yet even this was heaven, when I thought That what my child required might be bought. Poor love! she never knew her natural food, Grief had dried up the source from whence it flowed; And day by day I saw, with pain and fright, Her cheeks grow thinner and her eyes less bright; I sought advice, my darling in my arms, I feared to hear confirmed my soul's alarms, For all my soul was centred in my child; Oh, what was life to me of her despoiled! Behold me now at the physician's door, With my last piece of gold, my only store; In turn am called, and, with an anxious heart, My fears and my necessities impart. He was a mild, kind, venerable man, Who patient heard me, ere himself began: He told me that my child requirÃ¨d more Good food than physic; that the blood was poor; She needed nourishment and wholesome air, Which, with good nursing, would her health repair. I promised what he ordered should be tried, And humbly offered all my purse supplied; Sadly he smiled, gave back the coin again, Traced a few words with quick and ready pen; Handed me kindly what appeared to be, To my unpractised eyes, a recipe; Pressed my cold, trembling hand within his own; Charged me to come again in courteous tone; And bade me hasten to a shop where he Knew that the drugs were what they ought to be. I found the house, proffered the paper straight, And for the medicine sat me down to wait; When, to my great amazement, gracious heaven! Five golden pieces were politely given. I sought for explanation, and was told The paper did not order drugs, but gold. How did my heart with gratitude o'erflow; A rock of refuge in my sea of woe, A friend was found to whom I could apply; I felt my heart expand; sweet sympathy Shed its warm lustre o'er my prospect drear, Illumed my faint-sketched hope, and banished fear. Again I saw the welcome bloom of health In that sweet face which formed my only wealth; And, in that sight, almost forgot my pain; Nay, dared to dream of happiness again. Too soon, be sure, does hateful want return To one whose efforts such a trifle earn. Again my loved one's roses fade from view, Again I see privation's sickly hue; Want, baffled once, returns with doubled force; My wretched fortunes fall from bad to worse. That pittance small now fails me in my need; Employment ceases, I am poor indeed! A month drags on; each day that angel frail Becomes more thin, more dazzlingly pale; Her eyes acquire that steadfast, meaning gaze, That look which should have come with length of days. I sought that good, kind man, whose name I loved, But he to brighter spheres had been removed. What did I then? you askâI turned to thee! You may conceive my abject misery, When I could stoop so low as to demand Aught like a favour at thy perjured hand: But, oh! to watch my infant's gasping breath, Her wasted cheeksâinevitable death! To know the author of her being could Prevent her perishing from want of food, Did I but seek him, as I felt I ought, Nor let her perish by my pride; the thought Subdued me quite; the mother, in my soul, Drove out all feelings else, and claimed the whole. I flew to find you, but misfortune still Dogged every step with unrelenting will. You were abroad, they said; I turned aside, Mute with despair, and bankrupt of my pride. 'Twas a raw, gusty night, the chilling wind, Like the cold world, was cutting and unkind. My vitals felt sharp hunger's gnawing fangâ A dead, dull, sickening pain, not the swift pang That, in sheer mercy to the sufferer, kills All sense of life and its attendant ills: Nor bread, nor fire, nor light beneath my roof, Goaded by stinging memory's reproof, A moral drunkenness o'erwhelmed my mind, Reckless I wandered, to reflection blind; Temptation whispered, backed by hunger's voiceâ Disgrace or death were offered to my choice. I struggled, faltered, and, in fine, became That which my tongue e'en now denies to name. I fell: let those who would condemn me try In such a strife to gain the mastery. Let constant hunger's goading, empty pain Send up its dark suggestions to the brain. Look but abroad: each passing figure seems Fair fortune's child, to envy's sickly dreams; Add to all this the thought that you possess No friend to aid you in your dire distress; That all the troubles under which you smart Arose from owning a too feeling heart; That you are starving, hopeless, and despised, While flaunting vice is flattered, pampered, prized; Crown the dark picture with a starving child, And the world's censure must, methinks, be mild. I fell: yet did I most myself abhorâ Shame, horror, anguish, my sad bosom tore. I owned a treasure I did not suspect; I felt its lossâthe loss of self-respect. Till now, whate'er the heartless world might deem, I paused upon the brink of vice's stream; Now all opinion I had dared to brave, By boldly launching on its filthy wave. Stung by remorse's voice, I vainly try To drown its tones in inebriety; Laugh, with a loud and would-be joyous tone, At things which once had turned me into stone. That frightful life! A constant acted lieâ Death in the heart and laughter in the eye; False tears, false smilesâbut words are all too faint; No tongue can aptly tell, no pen can paint That fallen state, its mad, its feverish joysâ The fruit of drink, which, day by day, destroys Sense, feeling, conscience, triumphs o'er the will, And renders hideous vice more hideous still. Its waking horrorsâstinging, sharp remorseâ Again forgotten in guilt's giddy course: Those scenes, where oft the borrowed colour pales Beside the crimson which the cheek assails; This and much more have I endured; and why? My guilty conscience whispers a reply. I dared to have a secret, dared conceal That which my duty bound me to reveal; Strong in my own conceit, I set at nought Those laws which woman's instinct might have taught; Descended to be partner in a cheat, And fellâa victim to my own deceit. Oh! that the young and thoughtless could but know How one false step may plunge them into woe; That one departure from truth's open plain Brings falsehood's spurious offspring in its train; That none can caution, guide, instruct, reprove, Like those whom God and nature bid us love. But little more remains; the oft-told tale Has the same endâthe lazar house, the jail! The last I never knew; the first has been My late sad refuge in this fitful scene. What of my child? False villain! would'st pretend At this dread hour to be my infant's friend? Dost deem me still so blind as not to see That thou hast been my deadliest enemy? Dost think that I would let that angel fair Owe aught to thee, or risk thy devilish care? Never! Let gaping worldlings blame the deed; These hands from life and sin my darling freed. When late thy words broke on my startled ear, For her pure soul I breathed my latest prayer. Canst understand? My childâthy child isâdead! Yon tranquil wave flows o'er her gentle head; Sinless she sleeps; nor can she ever know Her mother's scarlet shame, her mother's woe. Murderess! E'en so. My child, I come! I come To share thy peace and join thee in thy tomb.â LXII. This said, upon the parapet With lightning's speed she flew; Laughing with maniac wildness, She waved a last adieu, Then boldly plunged; the treacherous stream Received in its embrace That fragile form, of whose dark deed Its surface showed no trace. No coward he who sprang to save; He could not, dared not see, Without compunction, the last act Of this sad tragedy. LXIII. He sprang to save; but sleep no more Had power o'er his frame; At that last crowning horror His waking senses came. With haggard look he stared around, But saw nor bridge, nor stream; Yet could such vivid scenes be nought But phantoms of a dream; But for the room, the morning light, The open volume, he Had felt almost inclined To doubt his own identity. LXIV. His waking senses once restored, His mental vision clear, He pondered on that warning dream With conscience-stricken fear. Who shall attempt to fathom The dark deceit of man? The hidden purpose of his soul Who but himself may scan? Yet what man's vision fails to note Cannot escape the eye Of Him from whom no thought is hid, âThe All-seeing Judgeâ on high. LXV. Humbled, confused, he prayed; His prayer, that he might be Enabled to withstand the assaults Of man's arch enemy. He rose again with lighter heart, Entered a garden fair, And drank in health and confidence With the pure morning air. Here leave we him to think awhile, And commune with his heart, Later we'll see what counsel The warning did impart. END OF THE SECOND CANTO. CANTO THIRD REALITY. ARGUMENT.

I. Join we our hero in his walk. How clear, how sweet the morn; Raindrops, like jewels glistening, Each pendant leaf adorn. The sun has welcome in his smile, The coy breeze woos the cheek, Nature, with scarce dried tears, repents The storm's untoward freak. Slowly the frightened flowers ope Their petals to the gale, Greet blushingly their deity, And all their sweets exhale. II. So looks enchanting woman when, Her anger chased away, The sunshine of her smile proclaims The dawn of Love's fair day; Her humid eyes alone announce The tempest of the soul; From her ripe lips the low soft sigh, She cannot all control, Sheds its warm fragrance round her path; The trace of sorrow's tear Renders her beauty more refined, Her melting smile more dear. III. The feathered tribe their matin hymn Are warbling in delight; The soaring lark is winging His bold aspiring flight; Each note ecstatic, as he mounts, Is ringing full and clear; Like summons from the liquid sky It bursts upon the ear; Inviting all the lower world To share his present joy, And seek those brighter realms where life Is free from earth's alloy. IV. At times the nightingale is heard, But changed her brilliant note; No longer does a flood of sound Swell her melodious throat; A thousand warblers drown that voice, Which through the livelong night Gave beauty to the darkness, And heralded the light; The peerless queen of song laments, In sadness, her disgrace, As to more noisy rivals she Reluctantly gives place. V. Our youth, scarce conscious, bends his steps Where yonder spreading tree Stands in disdainful solitude And giant majesty; Curling above its massive head The blue smoke slow ascends, And to its verdure, deeply green, A richer colour lends. Mark you yon clustering ivy, Yon vane and gable high, While barns and stacks of quaintest form Beyond it catch the eye. VI. It is the home of her he loves; Yon moss-grown roof enshrines A treasure to his mind more rich Than all Golconda's mines; A heart whose firm devotion, Whose warm, unselfish truth, Are mirrored in her deep blue eyes; A form where graceful youth Struggles with jealous nature, Who would assert her right To stamp the seal of womanhood Upon that figure light. VII. How every look of those mild eyes, How every murmured word, Crowds thickly to his softened heart; The stream of memory stirred, A thousand traits of modest love Straight to the surface rise, A thousand nameless nothings, Yet priceless in his eyes. He muses on her loveliness, But turns with sudden start, As the dark shadow of his dream Creeps o'er his conscious heart. VIII. Why does the moody frown of care Darken that open brow? So near the haven of his heart, Can he be thoughtful now? Ah me, ah me! if 'mongst the young Love finds uncounted friends, He must perforce content himself With them his empire ends: To parents' ears too oft his name Is a forbidden word; While wealth, state, station, interest, To love are all preferred. IX. His father's eye, his father's frown, How shall he dare to face? Will that proud nobleman connive At such a fell disgrace? Admit a yeoman's daughter To quarter on the shield, Whose cognizance dates from the day Of Hastings' bloody field? Or, ere he meets that cold grey eye, Shall he not counsel ask Of one whose age and character Well suit him for the task? X. Where shall fit monitor be found? Surely he cannot err Who, his soul tossed by doubts, consults A Christian minister. This thought inspires our youth's full heart, As, with admiring eye, He marks the verdant turf which belts The neighbouring rectory. Yes, none so fit as that good man; His case demands far more Than the false sophistry which oft Forms worldly wisdom's store. XI He enters the well-kept domain, When suddenly the chime Struck by the neighbouring church's clock Reminds him that the time Is over-earlyâhe retreats; But ere he gains the lane, The Rector's voice, in hearty tone, Invites him to remain. No sluggard he; too well he knew That all the after day Was nought, if morning's pliant hours Pass unimproved away. XII. He was a tall and upright man, O'er whose time-honoured head The snows of three-score years and ten Were plentifully shed. But the bright eye, the ruddy cheek, The cheerful smile, all showed That Father Time on him had laid His very lightest load; Nor was he wholly free from care; Each grief that touched his fold, Provoked the sympathising tear He knew not to withhold. XIII. No whistling boy who reverence made, No hind who passed his gate, But could of his benevolence Some noble proof relate. Sickness ne'er found him absent, Trouble ne'er called in vain, To stammer forth the many ills Which form its motley train; Stoutly he battled vice's band, Abuse and insult braved, While there was hope that by his means A sinner might be saved. XIV. Nor to the wretched and the poor Were all his cares confined; The proper duties of the rich He rigidly enjoined. Himself still foremost in the work, He laboured in the race, Like one who felt that in this world Man tarries briefest space. Vain in his eyes all titles, Creations of a breath, Which, like the proud waves, soon subside In the great ocean, death. XV. He was a humble Christian, Who held in almost scorn The paltry quibbles of the schools, The controversial thorn Which rends religion's sacred veil, And all profanely shows The stewards of Christ's dear legacy Arrayed as bitter foes; He kept the Christian's beaten track, Which broad and open lies, Avoided bigotry, and shunned Bewildering sophistries. XVI. Such was the man to whom the youth Determined to apply; Upon his ripened judgment He knew he might rely; To his indulgent ear he felt He could his love confide; To him, as preacher of âthe Word,â He would bow down his pride: And then his dream, that warning dream! Yet must it all be told; Aye, e'en his inmost thoughts he would To that good man unfold. XVII. His course of action once resolved, He gazes with delight On all the flowering beauties Which proudly court the sight. Roses of each variety And every hue are there; The blushing bud with cloak of moss Smiles on her sisters fair, Feigning to hide her mantling cheek Beneath her rustic hood, Yet panting to display her charms In all their plenitude. XVIII. Here, too, the modest âpomponâ smiles In innocence serene, The gem of all her beauteous tribe, The rose's fairy queen; Fragrant, retiring, graceful, The timid one would fain, Beneath the shelter of her leaves, Escape the gaze profane; Forgetting that her balmy breath Will guide the spoiler's hand, And bring sad ruin on the bower Her modesty has planned. XIX. The garden's various charms admired, The good man takes his arm, And with complacent pride points out The treasures of his farm. Now is our hero quite at home; Here, with a judge's eye, He scans the stock, and on each breed Descants right learnedly. But in a garden, pshaw! Full well each flower he knew, Yet cull the common from the rare Was more than he could do. XX. Then came the breakfast, and if I Must tell the simple truth, The summons was most welcome To our half-famished youth; And such a breakfast; not the meal Composed of tea and toast, But one that spoke substantially In favour of the host. I have no time for long details, But this I can declare, That all things fitting the repast Were in great plenty there. XXI. The cloth removed, the host withdrew, Leaving our youth, the while, The postman's latest freight of news His leisure to beguile; Though, sooth to say, our hero felt A fluttering at his heart; 'Twas no slight undertaking his, A love tale to impart. He pondered in what words his case Might be most fitly stated, But found his logic was at fault, His eloquence checkmated. XXII. He taxed his ingenuity, But somehow the affair Appeared more awkward than before; At length, in blank despair, He thought of flight; he would defer His visit till next day. Vain subterfuge! his case he found Admitted no delay, As o'er his memory flashed the thought That towards the hour of five, With railroad punctuality, His father would arrive. XXIII. Procrastination would not do, This fact was very clear; And after all, from that good man He had not much to fear; Besidesâbut here the butler came, And, in his blandest tone, Informed him that the rector was, At present, quite alone. An unctuous man that butler, His full and shining face Made many a hungry curate Half envy him his place. XXIV. He follows the sleek servitor, Resolved to brave his fate; And with the worthy clergyman Finds himself tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte. Skilled in the weakness of the heart, The experienced man pretends That with his lordship he will use The privilege of friends. âFive minutes more and he is free,â Five minutes he well knew Would smooth the awkward opening of An awkward interview. XXV. It was a well-proportioned room, With three bow windows, which Gave entrance to a balcony In choice exotics rich: Venetian blinds, fixed firmly down, Permitted the fresh air To enter freely, but kept out The day's too searching glare: A cool, subdued, refreshing tone Pervaded all the place, Hiding the tell-tale blush which clothed The youth's ingenuous face. XXVI. The tempered light, and more than all, The churchman's ready tact, Gave boldness to the penitent, Who felt that he must act His part with loyalty and truth; He hastened to commence. Soon, by his theme inspired, he spoke With heartfelt eloquence; Deaf to all else, he failed to note His hearer's smothered sigh, As the dear name of her he loved Escaped unconsciously. XXVII. Now with love's fluent energy, With truth's persuasive tongue, He spoke of her as one on whom His very being hung; Dwelt on those nobler qualities Which stand time's searching test, Called her among all womankind The noblest, truest, best. Insensibly the worthy man Loses his troubled air, As in the thorny case he finds The heart at least is there. XXVIII. Long years roll back, again he sees A pure and blushing bride, Whose graceful air of bashfulness Struggles with happy pride; Yet a few years, and that fair girl, So envied, so admired, The last sad office of the Church Too soon, alas! required. He could not, without trembling, see That gentle being's child Exposed to danger and disgrace At which his soul recoiled. XXIX. But when the youth, with awestruck voice, His warning dream unfolds, The secret finger of design The astonished priest beholds. Swept from his thoughts is worldly rank, Forgotten mortal grade; 'Tis his to battle Satan's host, To rush to virtue's aid; Love, eloquence, conviction, Religion, all combine To win the restless heart of youth To duty's sacred shrine. XXX. Their converse o'er, with altered mien Slowly the youth returns; Determination's serious air All hesitation spurns. He dreads no more the frown of pride, The jargon of the world; To battle with a prejudice His banner is unfurled. Backed by that good man's counsel he No longer courts delay, But like a youthful warrior pants To join the coming fray. XXXI. Again the noble mansion Receives its anxious heir; The spacious centre hall he treads With thoughtful look of care. He gazes round abstractedly, But notes nor knight, nor dame, Who by the painter's subtle art Preserve a short-lived fame; Unnoticed all, the courtier's smile, The soldier's eagle eye; Nay, e'en soft beauty in its pride Is passed unheeded by. XXXII. Too tempest-tossed the youth's full heart To cherish thoughts like these; His hurried footsteps indicate A mind but ill at ease. He chafes at time's slow progress, Although each minute passed Brings nearer still the moment On which his fate is cast; Shudders to think how short a space Will clear the pitying gloom Which shrouds the future, yet would fain Anticipate his doom. XXXIII. At length, though slow the pace of time, He hears the clock strike five, The hour by his father named At which he should arrive; The carriage stopsâmy lord alightsâ Nods to the butler, who Has gained an elbowed precedence Among the flunkey crew; Stretches two fingers to his son, Accepts his arm, and now Enters the mansion of his sires 'Midst ranks who lowly bow. XXXIV. A demigod to their dull eyes; Yet the deep lines of care, Proclaiming the heart's history, Show scantiest joy is there. The clear grey eye, the tall thin form, The lip's cold curl attest The presence of a man who bears A viper in his breast; The cynic smile, the sallow hue, The lofty forehead prove A being who may all commandâ Except his fellows' love. XXXV. The social after-dinner hour, The wine, one might have thought, Would raise our hero's courageâ But no; he rather sought To banish local subjects (For to the conscious heart The most remote allusion strikes Like blow from sudden dart)â Prated of clubs, of theatres, balls, Or the last noble fool Who had by debts, or cards, or friends, Been driven from his stool. XXXVI. His lordship took his candle, Yawned out a faint good-night, Leaving our hesitating swain In most despondent plight. To-morrow, yes, to-morrow, He should be better able To cope with pride's resistance, Than o'er the dinner table. Dull, silly boy! he might have known That Cupid's best ally Presided o'er the occasion he Permitted to slip by. XXXVII. But all too soon to-morrow came, And our young hero found Himself and sire tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte, On this most ticklish ground; His lordship coolly listened, With calm, unruffled mien; No sign of anger or surprise Could at first sight be seen; Just as in climates tropic Clear sky in ev'ry part is When the âWhite Squallâ o'ertakes ye; And then âStand clear, my hearties!â XXXVIII. The novice told his simple tale: How first his passion grew; How struggling into life appeared, Each hour, some beauty new. A pitying smile the sire vouchsafed, As, warming with his theme, The youth, with Love's ripe eloquence, Explained his modest scheme: Some cottage in a brighter clime, Some quiet sheltered spot, With her he loved, was all he sought, He knew no happier lot. XXXIX. The father smiled to hear him speak As Love has ever done, But his smile was cold and cheerless As glance of wintry sun, Which, lighting up the landscape, Serves but to plainly show The world-wide desolation, which Till then we did not know; Trusting some green spot might exist, Till undeceived by this, We pay illusion's penalty With tears of bitterness. XL. But when he told his lifelike dream, With bated breath and low, That cynic visage grew as pale As if the warm blood's flow Was stopp'd by death's arresting hand. Nought but the restless eye Show'd life still subject to the nod Of ruthless destiny; A nervous twitching of the lip Proved, more than all beside, How strong the feeling which could thus In part arrest life's tide. XLI. But, with an iron power, the will Drove nature from her throne; The worldly noble would have blushed To be compelled to own Such maudlin weakness; and again The sceptic, smiling sneer Resumed its place, and the thin lips Dismissed their hue of fear; A low, half-stifled oath escaped, When he found out that he Was not sole âconfidantâ of this Bare-faced agacerie. XLII. He cursed within his inmost heart The dull and meddling priest, Who prated of morality To greatest as to least; Who would not unto noble birth Some privilege accord; But measured sin with equal scale In peasant and in lord. Nor could his haughty temper brook That any one should dare Proffer advice, ere he thought fit His pleasure to declare. XLIII. Yet on the surface nothing showed, There all appeared at rest, Nothing betrayed the passions That struggled in his breast. There pride and anger revelled, And disappointment's sting Served o'er the other feelings Its venomed hue to fling; As some volcano's lofty top Smiles o'er the verdant plain, Hiding the seething torrent Its breast can scarce retain. XLIV. The longest tale must have an end; Now must the lover wait The fiat of his haughty sire, Must learn from him his fate. All on a single word depends, And, with attentive ear, His heart upon his lips, he waits That little word to hear. But too world-wise that father To risk, by Yes or No, The issue of a scheme which he Yet hopes to overthrow. XLV. Deprive the tiger of his prey, The scorpion of its sting, Urge patience to a starving man, Preach meekness to a king; Arrest the progress of the wave, The storm's wild force withstand, Stay the relentless march of time, Or death's unsparing hand. These are as nothing to the task Of him who dreams he can Quench by an idle word the lusts That choke the soul of man. XLVI. Thus contradiction's rugged path The sire tried to shun, By raillery and ridicule He sought to bend his son; Laughed at his inexperience, And wondered much to find That he to female artifice Could be so very blind; Could yield himself so thoroughly Dupe to a woman's scheme, As of a mÃ©salliance E'en for an hour to dream. XLVII. In philosophic vein he sketched The passion's headlong race, How the loved object of the hour Too soon must cede its place, As captious fancy ranges; How woman's smile or pout Serves to instal the giver, And drive a rival out; Laid bare the pangs he must endure Who yields to passion's voice, Mistaking mere desire for love, A fancy for a choice. XLVIII. He showed that all appears to youth To wear a constant smile; While manhood's keener sight detects At once its hollow guile: Told him that in a few short years, The scales which sealed his eyes Would fall, and let him view the world Stripped of its false disguise; That he who barters all for love Must be prepared to see A manhood soured by goading cares, An age of misery. XLIX. He hinted, distantly, 'tis true, That it was scarcely wise To rivet Hymen's fetters Where Cupid's would suffice. But here the indignant lover Favoured the worldly peer With something like a sermon, Which merely raised a sneer, Succeeded by an argument, In which the ire parental Glanced casually at certain facts All bearing on the rent roll. L. This last threat only served to make The matter ten times worse; Finding persuasion useless, The father had recourse To his authority, and gave His son to understand That he must instantly prepare To quit his native land, And travel for a year or two. The East he recommended, As offering a tour to which His own views always tended. LI. Stunned by this telling blow, the youth At first made no reply, While the stern father plumed himself Upon his victory Somewhat too early; for the youth, In husky, choking voice, Pleaded a right to what he termed The privilege of choice; And, goaded by his sire's cold sneer, Vowed he would not consent To what he could regard as nought But downright banishment. LII. As water pent within a space Resents its narrow bounds, And bursting with appalling noise The startled ear astounds; Headlong the foaming torrent leaps, Uprooting in its path Whatever may oppose its course; E'en such the father's wrath, When he perceived that from that hour He could no more pretend To order with a father's voice, Or counsel as a friend. LIII. No longer master of himself, His fury knew no bound, His voice came from his quivering lips With a sharp, hissing sound. With knitted brow and close-clenched teeth, And fire-flashing eye (Each nerve seemed trembling 'neath the weight Of this indignity), He glared with fury on his son, And in sarcastic tone, Told him 'twixt wealth and beggary The choice would be his own. LIV. He swore with awful energy, That never from that hour Would he hold converse with a son Who thus defied his power; He sternly bade him recollect, Ere yet it was too late, That with his favour he would lose Both fortune and estate; That he had power over all Except that useless toy, An unsupported title, Of which he wished him joy. LV. With bitter words and threatening brow The father quits the place, Leaving the astounded lover To ponder on the case. His proud heart swells when thinking o'er The cruel threats and taunts To which he has been subjected, And now he wildly pants To escape the galling thraldom That holds him like a vice, A prisoner to the creaking car Of purblind prejudice. LVI. Needless to trace the struggleâ On one side haughty power, While on the other youth and hope, With beauty for a dower. Which conquered? Is it age that asks? Hast then forgot the day When through thy veins love's fire chased In all its lightning play? Which conquered? cry those coral lips. Fair angel! canst thou ask? Traitress! what risk would man not run In thy soft smile to bask? LVII. Which conquered? Love! earth spurning love! Not that vile traitor who Usurps his name, and oh! too oft! Assumes his semblance too. Which conquered? Could Love contemplate An age of blank despair; Kindle the fire in the fane, Nor place a vestal there? Never! The youth who can do this Must find some fitter name, And not palm off his forgery As Love's ethereal flame. LVIII. Love conquered, and a week's short space Saw her a trembling bride, While on his open brow was stamped A lover's hopeful pride. The father heard the news, and smiled, But smiled as foeman may, Who sees his enemy approach In battle's proud array The spot where some fell ambuscade Renders retreat in vain, And knows that soon those nodding plumes Must sweep the ensanguined plain. LIX. So the stern Earl the future scans; And, patient, waits the day When, sated with possession, His son will dearly pay The price of disobedience. He gloats with savage joy When he contrasts the penitent With the rash, self-willed boy, And longs for that triumphant hour, When, passion's fever o'er, He may remind him of his choice, And spurn him from his door. LX. In cheerless, solitary state, He broods o'er hopes destroyed; The dream of his declining years Is faded, baseless, void. Who shall decry his anger? What though a brain-sick boy May choose to barter all his hopes For love's too short-lived joy; Must age approve the shallow choice? Must stern experience try To unlearn the lessons of the past, A life's philosophy? LXI. Was he not wrong, that cold, stern man? Who says that he was not? Was he not smarting from the sting Of what he deemed a blot On his escutcheon? More than this. Hourly compelled to hear Those kind condolences of friends Which fall upon the ear So like self-gratulation, How doth the proud heart beat When forced to accept the world's base coin From every fool we meet! LXII. Heart-sick and disappointed, Each object to his eye Seems hateful, and in sheer disgust He now resolves to try Whether in travel's rapid whirl He may not haply find An antidote to his ennuiâ A solace for the mind; Whether by constant change of scene He may not drive away The memory of blasted hopes That haunts him night and day. LXIII. In such a soul as his the thought Was herald to the deed, To things that pleaded for delay He gave but little heed; The duties of his large estate, All worthless in his eyes Since the transgression of his son, A lawyer's care supplies. For him the future's nothing, The past a useless token, The wine of life exhausted, The crystal goblet broken. LXIV. He hies him from his island home, He sees its pale cliffs fade, While Gallia's dark and frowning coast More clearly is displayed. He lands 'twixt files of soldiers who, It can but be confessed, Seem rather meant to watch a foe Than to receive a guest; He braves the Douane's harsh ordeal, And notes, with haughty scorn, That to âMilor Anglaisâ its bolts Are instantly withdrawn. LXV. Paris receives the lordly guest, Paris the bright, the gay, Where taste, in queenly state enshrined, Holds undisputed sway. Fearing no rival, east and west Her laws unchallenged fly; Admiring Europe owns with smiles Her proud supremacy. Rank, beauty, fortune, fashion All press around her throne, Striving to glean her graces, And add them to their own. LXVI. But Paris and its gaieties He views with jaundiced eye, And quits fair France's capital With many a smothered sigh. He thinks of bygone times, when he Had fluttered for a while The cynosure of glancing eyes, The aim of many a smile; Of days when youth could not believe That pleasure's draught could be Succeeded by the sickening void Of palled satiety. LXVII. Seeking relief, now here, now there, The outraged father flees; But to a mind diseased, alas! Change brings but little ease. What boots it to the broken heart That nature's gayest smile Welcomes the pilgrim of despair! Though banished for a while, Sorrow regains its mansion; We feel, with rising sigh, That the bright gladness of the hour But mocks our misery. LXVIII. By impulse or by hazard swayed, Heedless the wanderer strays; Now shivers under Russia's snows, Now pants beneath the rays That warm the south's more favoured soil, And to its people lend Those strange impulsive characters Which through the land extend; Fanned by enthusiasm's breath, Impetuous, daring, brave, Wanting its quickening influence, A listless, soulless slave. LXIX. Now from the Switzer's Heaven-reared wall He views the fertile plains O'er which, by military sway, The haughty Austrian reigns. Yet, if the unalterable past May haply aid us read The hidden future, we may hope To see Italia freed; May trust that, at no distant day, Her slavery will cease, While she a resting place may find With liberty and peace. LXX. O Liberty! thou word profaned! Ne'er will thy smile be given To noisy demagogues, by whom Thy zone is rudely riven. Too coy a maiden thou, Thy godlike front to show To men who rashly strive to tear The veil from that pure brow. Thy smallest favours must be stored With more than miser's care, Ere yet thy worshippers can hope Thy confidence to share. LXXI. Why tremble, sons of Italy? Why dread the tyrant's nod? Remember that a nation's shout Echoes the voice of God! Link'd by the love of country, Shake off your selfish fears! See, through the gloom of slavery, The ray of hope appears! Win, step by step, the toilsome path, Regard nor right nor left, Till ye have gained the immortal prize Of which ye are bereft. LXXII. In the great struggle to be free Be patriotism your guide; Attack that strong ally who now Fights on the tyrant's sideâ The giant bully, ignorance, By whom he gains far more Than by the sabre's flashing stroke, Or culverin's loud roar. Call to your aid the conquering mind, And tyranny will be Forced to succumb before the might Of peaceful Liberty. LXXIII. But while the angry father roams, How fares the truant son? Tried by the touchstone, Time, does he Repent of what is done? Voyons un peu! You see that house?â Not that huge stone affair; Hofer, or Tell, or some one else, Raised freedom's standard there;â That cottage cover'd by a vine, There, halfway down the hill, That villaânot the term you say! Well, chÃ¢let, if you will. LXXIV. ChÃ¢let, or villa, there it stands, And there our wedded pair Have seen three winters' breaths replaced By spring's more genial air. Nor is that all; for once within The garden you will see That though we left them only two, Somehow we find them three. Why round the lady's graceful neck Those chubby arms entwine, The gentle reader's sympathy Par hazard may divine. LXXV. The wife's bright smile proclaims, methinks, A bosom free from care, Nor does the husband, on the whole, Appear âthe worse for wear.â More bronzed, a shade more thoughtful, yes, But certainly improved; Nor is the lady quite the sylph She was when first he loved. But place the gain against the loss, And you will find the amount Is more than balanced, when the child Is âcarried to account.â LXXVI. That little casket doth contain A jewel pure and bright, A gem whose perfect loveliness Is watched with fond delight. Each day, each hour, the heaven-sent gift Discloses some new trait, As leaf by leaf the gentle bud Expands to open day. On that frail flower how much depends? Oh, wondrous, mystic tie! A father's heart, a mother's soul, Within thy fastenings lie. LXXVII. How do they live? You're quite correct, They do not live on air; A rich old maiden aunt of his Was privy to the affair. A disappointment in her youth Rendered her somewhat blind To differences of station, To love's heroics kind: She feeds the hymeneal lamp, So 'tis reported here, And trusts to time to reconcile The rebel and the peer. LXXVIII. Certain it is that once a year The husband duly hies From hence, and visits England's coast, But whether the supplies Depend on his migration Is past my art to tell. He regularly stops a month, That I can vouch for well, Because, while he is absent, Myself and Mistress Bull Do all we can in order that The wife may not feel dull. LXXIX. 'Twas pretty that same Swiss retreat; Within those modest walls More tranquil happiness was found Than usually falls To Hymen's votaries; but then, The lady did not try To hoist the banner of revolt, Female supremacy. Her gentle, loving, grateful heart Desired no better task Than to anticipate his wish Ere he himself could ask. LXXX. Each to the other all in all, Twin partners in the crime, The way they bore their banishment Was something quite sublime. To see them scamper o'er the hills, Or scale the mountain's side, Or, floating in their tiny skiff, Across the waters glide, A stranger to their story Had judged in half a minute, Not that they wept their error, But rather gloried in it. LXXXI. The homely Swiss, who saw them Thus constantly together, Conceived some curious notions Regarding Hymen's tether Amongst us bilious Britons; Of one thing they were certain, That, when o'er nuptial brows Once fell the marriage curtain, Each victim made a promise To keep the fellow martyr Within a distance measured With the bride's wedding garter. LXXXII. To balance such strict tenure, Should their affections alter, The husband was at liberty, Forthwith, to place a halter Loosely around the fair one's neck, Provided she were willing, And thus accoutred sell her By auction for a shilling. His absence was regarded As legal recreation, A matrimonial license, Or Benedict's vacation. LXXXIII. Some people hold it folly To venture an opinion On foreign countries until you Have lived 'neath their dominion; But at this bold assertion Your humble servant cavils. You think you know your own land, But in your wide-world travels You'll hear, and that not seldom, The boasted laws of Britain Expounded in a fashion You never would have hit on. LXXXIV. You grumble at the taxes, But you will greatly wonder How the Exchequer's ruler Contrives to keep them under, On hearing that he pampers A host of foreign minions; Maintains a local paper in Each potentate's dominions; Whose duty is to always keep That country in hot water, That perfide Albion may engross The entire trade and barter. LXXXV. Strange countries should be seen, Like mountains, from a distance; For what, at first, seems adverse, Grants in the end assistance; As, near them, Turner's pictures Are dabs of red and yellow, Yet, further off, these colours Harmoniously mellow, And that which, scanned too closely, Was colour'd hocus-pocus, Becomes âA Hero's Triumphâ When view'd from a right focus. LXXXVI. But where's our hero? Really This continental fashion Of viewing things Britannic Has put me in a passion; Caused me to utter âtreasonâ 'Gainst England's greatest artist; Proved me, in taste's dominions, A dilletante Chartist. It's well I curbed my anger, He's in the act of starting, And now, with fond injunctions, Gives the last kiss at parting. LXXXVII. How! the last kiss! don't worry! The month once fairly over, The husband will fly homeward As quickly as a lover; But his own serious face, His little daughter's wonder, Might lead an ignoramus Into an awkward blunder. These, with his wife's moist eyes, Which 'tis scarce fair to mention, I fear have caused the reader A pang of apprehension. LXXXVIII. Now the malle poste relentless Has borne away our hero, The lady's spirits sinking Down to a mental zero. But one short month! no longer! Yet that month always lingers, As if old Time would hold it For ever in his fingers. Her husband there, the hours fly, Like barb by rider goaded; But in his absence creep along, As doth an ass o'erloaded. LXXXIX. She wander'd through the lonesome house With slow and listless pace, But miss'd at every turn the form Whose image filled the place. His whip, his gun, all idle hung; Nay, e'en his pipe was there; It was the only vice he had; Indeed 'tis hardly fair To mention this last article, But truth compels my pen To state a fact which proves that he Had faults like other men. XC. Wedlock had altogether failed To wean him from this folly; He would persist it banished The demon Melancholy. And by this artful statement Enlisted in its favour His wife, who (silly woman) Declared she liked the flavour; But you and I both know, ma'am, That by this mean admission She lost her only outpost For future opposition. XCI. O favoured weed, whose worship Can boast of names whose lustre Dazzles your foes and dumbfounds The pedant monarch's bluster! Shall man reject a blessing Which bounteous nature offers? An argument sufficient To silence paltry scoffers. Dear, much-abused tobacco! (Not that abuse will hurt you) Accept a poet's tribute To your consoling virtue. XCII. Had he but known you, grim Macbeth Had spared his vain demand, A âsweet oblivious antidoteâ Was ready to his hand. Misfortune's startling lineaments Are softened by your aid, Trouble's grim physiognomy In a new light displayed; Your presence banishes despair And its attendant train; You are a cordial to the heart, A solace to the brain. XCIII. During the loved one's wanderings, In her all-partial eyes, Even an idle habitude Assumed a pleasing guise. How oft beside the crackling fire, In confidential chat, Armed with his pipe, in happiest mood, For hours they had sat; How many a day-dream they had shared, Dreams from all sorrow free, The circling vapour shutting out Life's stern reality. XCIV. What with her household duties, And memories of the past, The first week of the dreaded month Came to an end at last. 'Twas something truly to have cut One portion from the four, Although impatience brought to mind That there were still three more. When lo! this tedious sameness, So dull and uninviting, Was changed by an occurrence As sudden as exciting. XCV. Following its tortuous course, Until it reached the valley, The mountain road, diverging, Passed very near the chÃ¢let. This route showed signs of traffic, A thing by no means common, The sound of wheels was heard, And forthwith every woman Rushed to the nearest casement, With laudable intention Of trying to enlarge Her sphere of comprehension. XCVI. Enveloped in a cloud of dust, A carriage was descried, Quite at the mercy of two steeds, Who all control defied. Down the steep hill the startled brutes Dashed on at furious rate, Bearing a luckless voyageur Resistless towards his fate; Till, unseen, or unheeded, A chance obstruction shattered The doomed calÃ¨che, and its contents In wild confusion scattered. XCVII. The driver's rude displacement Resulted in his falling Into a quickset hedgerow; And though the fellow's bawling Announced at least a fracture, The brambles' intervention Saved him from any damage, At least that's worth the mention; While on the open highway, Which had been lately mended, Pale, bleeding, and unconscious, The traveller lay extended. XCVIII. There seemed at first no reason Why the âblind dame'sâ assistance Merited thanks; but softlyâ At scarce a furlong's distance The road approached a precipice, From whose o'erhanging summit, Deeper than fathoms fifty, You might have dropped a plummet. O'er this the horses bounded, Blinded by rage and terror, And a dark, shapeless object Alone proclaimed their error. XCIX. Yet bad as was the accident, Its sequel showed that often Philosophy in practice Life's greatest ills can soften. 'Tis a sad world, no doubt, Yet its worst phases show us, Looked at through wisdom's optics, A deeper depth below us; Though in this case the victim Could scarcely be expected To give Fate thanks for being So suddenly ejected. C. All helpless lies the stranger, While round him shrilly rises, In various idiom uttered, A legion of surmises. Who he can be? where come from? The universal question; To which, with wondrous quickness, Each offers a suggestion, Until the mansion's mistress Issues her verbal warrant To bring the sufferer in, Which stops the wordy torrent. CI. One neighbour proffers nostrums Culled from the floral herbal; This hastens to advise the mayor To draw up ProcÃ¨s verbal. Madame's own handmaid faints outright, So much the sight has shocked her; The busy gardener runs full speed To fetch the village doctor; The lady and her nurse, Mid'st much expostulation, First stanch the wound, and then attack Suspended animation. CII. Hartshorn and sal-volatile And all things efficacious Are tried upon the patient, But each turns out fallacious; Although with Friars' balsam, And rags in great profusion, And that best thing, cold water, They stop the blood's effusion Till the arrival of the leech, Who lint and rag displaces, Then clears the room, and closes The door in all their faces. CIII. At length the medico appeared, With that important air Which even doctors will assume Where accidents are rare; Parried a host of questions With singular adroitness. Wishing to render fully The duties of politeness, He sought the lady's presence, And all the symptoms stated; Though I suspect the danger Was somewhat overrated. CIV. There was cerebral pressure, The symptoms served to prove it; But local applications, He trusted, would remove it. He could detect no fracture In his examination, But greatly dreaded the effects Of nervous irritation; Hinted how fortunate it was That he had been selected, As in less practised hands this fact Might not have been detected. CV. Whether the doctor's remedies Or nature's kindly powers Deserve the credit I know not; But after two long hours, The sufferer awoke to pain, And staring wildly round him, Was in the act of speaking, When his attendant bound him, By sundry signs, to silenceâ An order which the stranger Wisely obeyed, not wishing To aggravate his danger. CVI. Long time he lies as 'neath the spell Of some oppressive dream, So fitful, vague, and shadowy Does every object seem. Nature is too unhinged to note The hours as they pass; Half-coined impressions in the brain Form a chaotic mass; A ministering angel now His craving thirst supplies, Hovers a moment near his couch, And all as quickly flies. CVII. And now the fever fiend is gone, And the mad pulse's play To a mere languid echo Dies gradually away. A soothing sense of comfort Induces wholesome rest; Calmed is the oppressive heaving Which lately stirred his breast. With slow and sullen step the foe Withdraws him from the strife, Watching each opportunity To wrest the prize from Life. CVIII. The leech's wary tactics, And a sound constitution, Induced the âfatal sistersâ To change their resolution. The patient mended daily, Found his digestion quicken, Discarded arrow-root for broth, And that in turn for chicken. And, just a fortnight from the day That saw them all despairing, The invalid was well enough To take a carriage airing. CIX. But first he sought the âlady fair,â And eloquently paid His meed of heartfelt gratitude; Owned that her timely aid And generous care had saved a life On which he set small store (A deep sigh proved how true his words); Still he should evermore Feel that he owed the boon to her, And hoped to see the day When fate might place it in his power Her kindness to repay. CX. His hostess, proud of her success, Beguiled the vacant hours, And to amuse his leisure Exerted all her powers. The views, the lake, the rapids, Were each in turn inspected; The âHorse's Leapâ (lately so named) Be sure was not neglected. Here through the convalescent's frame Shot something like a spasm, As, with a dizzy brain, he strove To pierce the yawning chasm. CXI. The morn was given to rambles, The eve to conversation, In which the guest made patent His powers of narration. He strove to amuse his hearer, Nor vain was the endeavour; His hostess smiled, or shuddered, But interested ever, Listened to his adventures In desert, camp, and city, Expressing admiration, Astonishment, or pity. CXII. He spoke of climes where rarely The traveller's footstep strays; Where Central Asia's nomad race No tyrant's will obeys. Here he had shared the Tartar's tent, And oft, in wayward mood, Braved the grim monarch of the woods, In this, his solitude. The threatened danger loomed in vain, Advice was thrown away, He seemed to live but in the chase, The tumult, or the fray. CXIII. The lady marvelled at his words, But doubted not the tale; So lifelike was the narrative, That it could hardly fail To force conviction on the mind, E'en had the hearer been An old and practised actor In this world's changeful scene. Oft to her lips the question rose, Why in life's autumn he Should find delight in scenes so fraught With craft and cruelty? CXIV. But in his deeply-furrowed brow And half-checked sigh she read, That all which formed the charm of life From him had long since fled; And in her woman's heart she felt That these pursuits could be Nought but attempts to drown the sense Of mental agony. Had he outlived his happiness, And felt himself alone, Or had deception's poison turned A once warm heart to stone? CXV. She knew not; but she pitied That lone and sorrowing man, And quite a drama of romance Through her rich fancy ran. But just as woman's colouring Had sketched his former life, The postman's boisterous summons Recalled the anxious wife. She seized the missive long looked for, Glanced once at the direction, Then hurried off to indulge The dictates of affection. CXVI. She tore it open quickly, That you will doubtless credit, But won't believe she kissed it E'en oftener than she read it. Then, conscious of her rudeness, She hastily descended, Fearing her guest might feel himself Or slighted or offended; And to excuse her brusquerie, And little show of sorrow, Announced that she expected Her husband on the morrow. CXVII. The morrow came, and various signs Threatened a busy day, The guest,âwho dreaded nought so much As being in the way,â Provided with a book, withdrew Into a shady bower, Where, in his convalescence, he Had spent many an hour. Here he could plan his movements, For with returning vigour The wish to hurry onward Seized him with tenfold rigour. CXVIII. He would but thank the husband For all the wife's attention, And judge if he were worthy her; Though here his apprehension Suggested some misgivings, For female prizes often Fall to the share of blockheads, And but too rarely soften A heart that's worth the winning; Perhaps 'tis nature's plan To mix the evil with the good In all that touches man. CXIX. But while the impatient guest His future schemes thinks over, With beating heart the wife awaits The advent of the rover. Her longing eyes at length are blestâ The vehicle draws nearer; The features of its occupant Become, each moment, clearer. 'Tis he, 'tis he! oh, happiness! A truce to love's alarms, Another moment, and the wife Is folded in his arms. CXX. Now comes the exchange of newsâ The history of the stranger, The accident, his piteous plight, His illness, and his danger; His look, his age, his bearing, His manners, and his nation; Her own ideas, moreover, As to his social station. Here, to her great surprise, Her mem'ry gives her warning That her guest has not proffered The greetings of the morning. CXXI. The husband, hearing where he is, Hospitably proposes, In laughing mood, to visit This âlove among the roses.â The wife, who was at all times Proud of her partner's graces, The task of introduction Most readily embraces. Her kind heart breathes a prayer That her joy may not darken The guest's lone state, and make him To thoughts despondent hearken. CXXII. The child, with all an infant's glee, Delighted, leads the way, Determined to astonish him With the superb display Of all her late-acquired stores. Great friends they were, these two; Many the strolls which they had shared, And gambols not a few; And oft, when no inducement else Could cheat the child to rest, Close nestling to that cold, stern man, She slept upon his breast. CXXIII. Soon at the entrance of the bower The happy couple stand; The ardent youth, with manly air, Frankly extends his hand. But scarcely has the lady named Her âhusband,â ere she sees A sight that pales her damask cheek, And seems her blood to freeze. The guest, now haughty and erect, Fire darting from his eyes, Glares on his new-found host, who stands The image of surprise. Alarmed, she turns to him she loves, But, to her great amaze, An innate sense of conscious guilt His pallid cheek betrays. CXXIV. Short time endured this scene most strange, Yet long enough to show That she had succoured one who held Her husband as a foe. Shocked at the thought, with close-locked hands, And eyes dissolved in tears, She would have sunk upon the earth O'erpowered by her fears, But that the guest, all tenderly, Received her in his arms, Then pressed his lips to that pale brow, Now damp with love's alarms, Resigned that fainting burthen, As loath with it to part, And clasped the wonder-stricken child With phrenzy to his heart. CXXV. One glance at that fair infant face His anger served to tame; One single word broke from his lips, That word, a simple name. His outstretched hands forgiveness spoke; âFather,â the youth replied, And knelt him at his father's feet, Forgotten all his pride. He heard that well-known voice express Deep gratitude to Heaven, And rose, his only grief removed, His single fault forgiven. CXXVI. That hour plucked from an aching heart The canker of despair, Relieved it from the venomed brood That long had 'gendered there. Those ties, which late seemed torn apart, Contract with tenfold force; Love drives fell hatred from its seat, And banishes remorse. The clouds of anger are dispelled, Affection's genial ray Invites the bosom's buried germs To bloom in open day. CXXVII. The lady, smiling through her tears, Clings to her husband's breast, The joy, too big for utterance, In her soft eyes expressed. For though she had, within her heart, Confined the secret pain, Oft, with the blush of conscious worth, She thought of the disdain She had excited; better she Had listened to her pride, Flung the much-envied honour back, And, blessing him, have died! CXXVIII. Thus had she communed with herself And oh! the joy to know That she to his best interests No longer was a foe. Now would her husband take his place Amid the noble throng, Emerge from that obscurity Which clothed his name too long; Shine 'midst the brightestâhe, her own, Her treasure, her adored; To all that he had lost for her So happily restored. CXXIX. Thus passed a week, a happy week; And now they quit the scene With grateful hearts and moistened eyes; For like an island green In memory's waste that spot remained; To each it told a tale Of that pure joy so seldom known In life's unquiet vale. The sire longed impatiently To instal the wedded pair, And in affection's circle To claim a father's share. CXXX. Again on English soil they stand; Each bosom feels the glow Of satisfaction, while content Is stamped on every brow. The softened father feels no more The sting of wounded pride; The son, with happiness elate, Walks proudly by his side; The wife, her heart too full for words, Yet radiant with her joy, Feels (this sole cloud of care blown o'er) A bliss without alloy. CXXXI. They reach the busy capital, But care not now to move In fashion's vortex; sweeter far The birthplace of their loveâ The scene where every object Hints to the teeming brain Their passion's past emotions, Its pleasure and its pain. The father gives a glad assent, As, with a blushing grace, The wife elects the âAncestral Hallâ Her chosen dwelling place. CXXXII. Long had that noble mansion worn The livery of neglect, Nor could the closest scrutiny A sign of life detect. The long lines of its windows dark, Its jealous portals shut, Its terrace, foul with cankering moss, Marked by no human foot, Its walks, obscured by tangled weeds, Its face so blank and cold,â A history of abandonment That dull exterior told. CXXXIII. Changed is its aspect; yet, once more, It wears a joyous air; All who can claim the privilege In crowds are flocking there. Carriage and horseman throng the drive, On the same errand bent, To welcome back the wanderers With smile and compliment. From their dull sleep, long undisturbed, The echoes wake again, And make their soft responses heard Throughout the wide domain. CXXXIV. His late-found daughter by his side, The peer, with courtly grace, Receives the host of visitors Who occupy the place. To each he makes the lady known, And, with delight elate, Marks the sensation which such charms Are certain to create. The men all vote her perfect, The softer sex proclaim Her face and figure well enough, But think her somewhat tame. CXXXV. Pass we some months; 'tis early spring, A fresh and sunny morn, The dewdrops glisten on the grass Which clothes the spacious lawn; The neighbouring spire is musical With joyous peal and loud. Again long lines of carriages The mansion's portals crowd; But this time sunburnt peasants, And village matrons, too, Are flocking to the stately hall, All with one end in view. CXXXVI. What clothes each face with wreathing smiles? Can the same impulse move The rustic and the titled dame, The eagle and the dove? Render the proud one affable? Banish the sulky scowl With which the poor regard the rich? Reduce to its control Such warring elements as these? Yet, to the gazer's eye, One sentiment pervades the breast Of every passer by. CXXXVII. Yes, there is one which all must feel; 'Tis when the light of day Upon the new-born infant sheds Its doubly welcome ray; When the delighted mother's ear First hears that plaintive cry; When the long-cherished dream gives place To sweet reality. Nature asserts her magic power, Or high or low the lot, It flourishes to Time's full end, Life's freshest, brightest spot. CXXXVIII. A son is born! A son, an heir! Then forth the tidings go, And all for many miles around The joyful advent know. 'Tis this that brings the smiling throng, For this the bells resound; 'Tis this that sends the circling cup In quick succession round. What gratulations, wishes, vows! All tongues, from peer to nurse, The welcome stranger's attributes Unceasingly rehearse. CXXXIX. Here's to the heir's good health! Huzza! May he, through life's short span, Approve himself, in the best sense, Truly a noble man. May he regard as nought the chance Which cast his lot so high; May he upon the world look round With philosophic eye; Feel that high station is a trust, Wealth but âthe talentâ lent, To be the stay of virtue's cause, Not vice's instrument. CXL. So ends my strain. Present and past Are in the poet's power; But closed to reader and to bard The future's mystic hour. Though in rude verse my tale be sung, In simple language dressed, Yet may its moral haply find An echo in each breast. Could this be so, how pure a joy Would this torn bosom swell, And cheat of half its mournfulness That last sad word, FAREWELL. FINIS.</field>
