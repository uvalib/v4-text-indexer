      <field name="fulltext">POEMS Miscellaneous Pieces. LINES Suggested by seeing the Train containing the Queen and Suite pass through Coatbridge, on the Caledonian Railway, on her way to the North, May 1, 1862. My Queen! beloved, bereaved—no festal car Is that which speeds thee to the wilds afar. A stricken deer thou fliest, Oh mourning Queen, To seek thy wonted haunts and weep unseen! Weep, gracious Lady! tears are blessed things; Woe to the stricken heart from whence up-springs No gushing sorrows! Ah! the burning pain Of grief is softened by that tender rain. The hills of mist, the forests dense and lone, The mountain torrents plunging, thundering on, Wild glens, dark cories, lakes of silver sheen, Say to thy lonely heart, “Here he hath been!” But ah! the loving life of that sad heart But half survives, since he, its dearer part, Was reft by early death from thy lone side, And left thee sadly stemming life's dark tide. Yet not alone, though thy worn spirit pines That thou no more may'st read the tender lines Of love and truth writ on that pallid face, Where anguish'd suffering strove with patient grace; For ere he went, was wreathed a golden chain— The precious links are nine—still to retain Close to thy heart the children of his love, So dear on earth, and waited for above; And these dear pledges thou, in faith and prayer, Wilt watch, teach, guide, and lead to meet him there. Oh! may the dews of Heaven, descending, shed A balm celestial on thy sacred head— More sacred in the majesty of woe Than aught thy crown and sceptre can bestow! Though deep and true the sympathy we feel, Thine is a wound that only God can heal. Sharp was the stroke, and heavy was the rod, But He who chastened is thy Father—God. Kneel for His blessing—lean upon His breast Thy weary head, and sob thyself to rest. Forgive me, Lady; I would not intrude— I would not dare to stir with finger rude Thy depth of woe. God save thee and defend; To thee and thine be Husband, Father, Friend. CENTENARY POEM, Recited at Burns' Centenary Festival, held at Mauchlin, January 25, 1859. Oh Bard beloved! as pilgrims to thy shrine, With song and gift we come, our vows to pay; The growing fame of hundred years is thine, And lands and nations hail thy natal day. We bring thee hearts that while life's pulses beat Shall throb with love and pride, regret and shame; Love of thy worth, pride in thy genius great, Regret that Death, not Life, gave world-wide fame. And shame that Scotia, dazzled by the blaze Lit by her peasant Bard's poetic fire, Should, while she sunned her in the living rays, On Want's chill bosom see her Bard expire. Oh shade revered! the altar of thy fame This day we wreathe with fair immortal flowers Culled from each spot that's hallowed by thy name— By Doon, by Nith, by fair Montgomery's towers. From “Bonny Doon bring rose and woodbine twine,” From “Winding Ayr the birch and hawthorn hoar,” The flowers he pressed when Mary lay reclined Within his arms that clasped her nevermore. “The mountain daisy, bring the red red rose,” From haunted Alloway the ivy green, The “yellow broom” where stealing burnie flows, And “Coila's gift, the holly” sharp and sheen. And bring the “rough burr thistle, spreading wide,” The poet's hand aye “spared the symbol dear,” “The big ha' Bible ance his faither's pride;” Lives there a Scot but bids it welcome here? Oh! we have heard the Bruce at Bannockburn, When pealed his battle hymn along the line, Felt with the Bard that “Man was made to mourn,” And thrilled with memories of “Auld langsyne.” Great poet painter, these twin loves of thine, Fair Nature, and fair Woman, Nature's flower, Each in her beauty, in thy soul's deep shrine Were worshipped, painted, with a master's power. Fair was the pictured scene, sweet Ballochmyle, He drew within thy dewy glades at e'en, And fair the beauteous portrait drawn the while, He sung in glowing strains his “Bonny Jean.” Fair as thine own fair form, sad captive queen, The scenes portrayed in weeping Memory's eye, Thy Scotia robed in Nature's mantle green, Bestrewn with flowery gems of richest dye. The lily bank, the daisy-sheeted lea, The blossomed thorn, the primrose by the brae, No fairer sketch of Nature we may see, No sorrows sung in more pathetic lay. Burns—Nature's noblest, brightest, dearest son— Large, loving heart, and independent mind Were his—not to be bought, or warped, but won To love and sympathy for all mankind. Bright on the altar of his manly heart The holy flame of patriot ardour glowed; Love's fragrant incense, Truth undimmed by Art, And wit and humour flashing as they flowed. “A man's a man” whatever may befal Of honest poverty or lowly name— Birth, rank, and wealth, the poet lacked them all, But worth and genius gave him love and fame. And now, though “mouldering in the silent dust,” The heart that dearly loved fair Scotia lies, “Still in her bosom's core” he lives, and must To Fame's bright zenith nearer, higher rise. OCTOBER, 1861. Not changeful April, with her suns and showers, Pregnant with buds, whose birth the genial hours Of teeming May will give to life and light Rich in young beauty, odorous and bright. Not rose-crowned June, in trailing robes of bloom, Her flowery censers breathing rich perfume, Her glorious sunshine, and her bluest skies, Her wealth of dancing leaves where zephyr sighs. Nor fervid July, in her full-blown charms, Shedding the odorous hay with sun-browned arms, Nor glowing August, with her robe unbound, With ripening grain, and juicy fruitage crowned. Nor thee, September, though thine orchards glow With fruits, ripe, rich, and ruddy—laying low The yellow grain with gleaming sickles keen, With jest and laugh, and harvest song between. I sing October, month of all the year, To poet's soul and calm deep feeling dear; Her chastened sunshine, and her dreamy skies With tender magic charm my heart and eyes. In silvery haze the purple hills are swathed, In dripping dews the faded herbage bathed— Red Robin trills his winter-warning ditty; His big bright eye invoking crumbs and pity. From fading woodlands, ever pattering down, Come many tinted leaves—red, yellow, brown; The rustling carpet with slow lingering feet I thoughtful tread, inhaling odours sweet. The very soul of quietude is breathing O'er field and lake, with sweetest peace enwreathing My tranquil soul, from fonts of blissful feeling Sweet silent tears adown my cheeks are stealing. Spirit of meekness brooding in the air, On thy soft pinions waft my lowly prayer, That I may meet, calm, meek, resigned, and sober, My life's decline—my solemn—last October. SUMMER VOICES. Beneath the shining trembling leaves that drape the bowers of June, I sit and list with raptured ear to sweetly-varied tune Of Nature's thousand melodies—above, below, around— Sweet sights, sweet scents, but sweeter far the mingling charms of sound. The silvery lapse of tinkling streams; the river's rushing voice; The lucent waves that lap the shore in murmuring tones rejoice; The fitful cadence of the breeze that skims with silken wings O'er bending waves of odorous hay, and through the woodland sings; The tell-tale voice beloved of Spring; the wail of forest dove; The thousand swelling warbling throats that sing of bliss and love; The voice of woods, in soft commune with twilight's dewy airs, Where parent thrush on darkling bough beguiles his brooding cares; The shadows fall—Oh, gentle bird, thy liquid voice is mute; But, hark! that sweetly-thrilling strain breathed from the plaintive flute; No eye but thine, soft star of love, the rapt musician sees Slow wandering by the lonely lake beneath the sleeping trees. Now, Scotia! pour thy native airs so wildly, simply sweet, For this the hour and this the scene when rustic maidens meet By cottage door—by village spring, o'erhung with wilding rose. Hark from their lips the Doric lay in gushing music flows. Sweet Summer sounds, I love ye all; but, dearest—holiest—best— The song of praise from cottage hearth that hails the Sabbath rest; The birds—the streams—the breeze—the song to earthly sounds are given, This mounts the wings of Summer morn, and singing, flies to heaven! THE HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND. Queen of hundred ocean Isles, Rich in scenic grandeurs; Land of forest, hill, and glen, Where the tourist wanders. Land of torrent, lake, and stream, Wild sea-cliff and corry; Land of mist and legend old, Music, song, and story. Land that erst by thousands poured, From hovel, hut, and shieling, Loyal men, and brimmed their hearts With high, heroic feeling. Where, Oh where thy thousands now? Echo, wildly wailing, Gives mournful answer, Where, Oh where! Are our life's springs failing? No; the red deer yet are rife In dingle, copse, and forest, But the human form hath fail'd “When our needs are sorest.” Scarcity of men at the beginning of the Crimean War. Titled Nimrod's keepers, rude, With their canine allies, Hold usurp'd dominion now O'er thy hills and valleys. Grouse and heath-fowl o'er thy moors See by thousands winging; Thousand sportsmen trace their flight— Thousand shots are ringing. But the hunted Celt hath fled Heath and burning hovel, For lands where man meets equal man, Not as serf to grovel. High Dunrobin's stately dame, While thy train was sweeping Through Victoria's royal halls, Heard'st thou not the weeping Time of the Sutherland Evictions. Of thy vassals in the wild— The young, the old, the hoary, The babe, the mother, stalwart forms In manhood's pride and glory? Famine, and the ruthless arm Of legal power, impelling, Drove them forth, while o'er their homes Red waves of flame were swelling, And mournful from the parting shore, A voice comes sounding ever, We leave thee to return no more, Ah! never—never—never. CALEDONIA. Fair Caledonia! honoured name! The Muse shall boast thy worth and fame; The circling seas that dash and boil Around thy shores with loud turmoil; The beauteous vales where winds the Clyde, Where Tweeda rolls her lucent tide; The Tay—the Forth—majestic stream— So oft the Scottish Muse's theme; Thy woods, thy lakes, thy purple hills, The soul with fire poetic fills. Amidst thy mountains, wild and cold, Thy hardy sons in days of old Did boldly stem the impetuous tide Of Roman power, and forced their pride That aimed at universal sway To turn its course another way! And when proud Anglia strove in vain Around thy neck to wreathe the chain, Thy patriot sons—a filial band— As oft rescued their motherland, And say, dread spirit of the plain, Where Gaul's usurping pride was slain— Where Europe's allied hosts were spread— Where even the great Napoleon fled— Didst thou not mark, midst that fell strife, That thirst of glory, scorn of life, That martial flame, which kindling high, Illumed the Scottish warrior's eye, When thundering o'er the field of death They won the victor's proudest wreath? And truest—bravest—boldest still— Brave dwellers of the heath and hill— The first to scale red Alma's steep With bayonet's point and sabre's sweep; And foremost in the deadly fray, On Balaklava's bloody day Ye rode to death, and fearless braved The storm of fire that flamed and raved In pealing thunders on your track. Ye went—alas! how came ye back? Oh, Caledonia! not alone For valour famed; from her bright throne Fair Science smiles, and proudly owns Thy great, thy good, illustrious sons; Thy trading cities teem with wealth— Thy sturdy sons are gay with health; For honest pride and moral worth— The honour of their native North! Still may thy warriors overcome, Thy virtuous maids in beauty bloom; May learning, genius, virtue, smile, And freedom bless and crown our isle! THE CHILD OF FRANCE. On the Birth of the Prince Imperial of France. Exhausted, faint, and pale, A fair young mother lies— She hears her babe's first wail, And lifts her languid eyes; For he, the Imperial Sire, Her couch of suffering tends— In his dark eyes the fire Of pride and triumph blends. And while his arms retain The new-born child of France, Ambition's phantom train Through brain and bosom dance! A shadowy line of kings In long prospective rise, On rush of eagle wings, They cross his dreaming eyes. A hundred cannons boom— Loud vivas rend the air— Ten thousand lights illume The city of the heir. The noble, brave, and fair, The palace portals throng— All earth deems rich and rare, The admiring gaze prolong. The regal splendours round The wond'rous cot that holds The worshipp'd heir, late found His robes, embroider'd, folds The ermine gems and lace That drape the tiny form. Shall o'er that placid face Sweep Revolution's storm? Shall madden'd thousands swell, And rush like waves on shore, Assail with blow and yell? All this hath been before. Pale Reichstadt, Son of Napoleon I. where art thou? Bordeaux Heir of the Bourbons. and Orleans, The Orleans Family. where? Dead! exiles—wanderers now— And this is France's heir. The Sire hath rear'd a throne— Perchance a funeral pyre. Beneath chained thunders groan, And glows volcanic fire; An earthquake shock may rend The hollow-heaving earth, And from the gulf ascend A newer, sterner birth! The Titans of the press— The powers of speech and mind— Each in his dark recess, Like Samson, shorn and blind— May rise in strength and light, And, chainless, walk abroad; Their motto—Human right, Our country, and our God! LINES WRITTEN ON THE BIRTH OF THE YEAR 1853. Hail! infant year, fresh from the womb of Time, Cradled in clouds, what shapes and shades sublime Attend thy birth, and hover round thy head, Bright glowing hopes, dark signs of doubt and dread, So from her sea-girt ark flies Freedom's dove, Herald of Life, of Liberty, and Love. She beats with flagging wing the murky air, Above an ocean chaos of despair— She may not fold her wing, nor rest her foot, No voice may hail her—all is deathly mute; Broad Europe's shores are beaconless and dark; Fly to thy sheltering home—thine island ark. When waters are assuaged, and earth again Bares her cleans'd bosom, then shall not in vain Her soaring wings sweep through refulgent skies Where late the sun of Knowledge might not rise, And Superstition's pall, for ages hung Betwixt his God and man, and impious flung O'er mind and conscience, fettered, dark, defiled, Shall fall; the Word, the Truth of God, exiled From hearths and homes, shall circulate unconfined, Bright as the sun, and free as mountain wind. Ye sable millions, thralls of wrong and woe, Who wear the chain, and crouch beneath the blow, Your tears and blood, your stripes and toils, your shame Have found an ear in heaven—on earth a name. “The weeping blood in woman's heart” hath gushed In words of power, Mrs Stow's “Uncle Tom.” to million eyes hath rushed The burning tear; alike from princely hall And humble homestead sounds the thrilling call Of Freedom for the slave. Thirst we for gold, Its pleasures, and its powers? Earth shall unfold, Nay, hath unfolded treasures such as seem The wild revealings of an Eastern dream, And struggling, toiling thousands, densely pent In cities, towns, and hamlets, labour-spent, Find in another sphere a golden soil, Nor need to “beg a brother's leave to toil.” “He is the freeman whom the Truth makes free; All else are slaves;” and riches, all that be Drawn from the earth, from enterprize, or Art, Are powerless to suffice man's craving heart, Till sated with earth's joys, or pall'd with vice, He, “Heaven-directed,” seeks the pearl of price; He finds, and binds the jewel on his heart— The gift, the grace of God, the better part. Hear my best wish for you, each lov'd compeer, This gift be yours, to crown the new-born year. LINES SUGGESTED BY THE WAR IN THE CRIMEA, 1854. Flapping fierce her gory pinions, Whetting sharp her crimson beak, Vulture War her barbarous minions, Calls her ghastly prey to seek. Now her hideous form comes swooping From the thundering ramparts' height, O'er the carnaged valley stooping, Gorged with slaughter—horrid sight! Shot and shell, the dark air rending— Sulphurous flash, and bayonet's gleam— Shouts and shrieks, and groans wild blending, With her loud discordant scream. High the purple tide is swelling, O'er the dark ensanguined plain, From a thousand bosoms welling, Mangled limbs and shattered brain! Oh! for angel eye and station, Far above the battle-cloud, Whence I'd view the dread migration Of the unbodied spirit crowd! Through eternity's dark portals To the abodes of weal or woe, Swiftly rush the new immortals— Lord, how long shall it be so? Summerland—Oh! beauteous region, Rich in foliage, flowers, and fruit, Shall the foe, whose name is Legion, Keep and tread thee under foot? Round thy leaguered port and city Volleying thunders ceaseless roar, Earth affords not aid or pity— They shall fall to rise no more! RHYMES FOR THE TIMES. I. I've juist been thinkin', neebour Johnie, Gif that the warl had mendit ony— Since, for the wurkin' man's disasters, We've got sae mony sa's an' plaisters. I've leukit laigh—I've leukit heigh— The gude time comin's unco driegh; There's routh o' teachers, schules, an' beuks, Chapels an' kirks in a' the neuks, Academies an' institutions, Wi' scientific contributions, On whilk ye may pit a' reliance, An' muckle tauk on social science, Mechanics, engineerin', minin', The gate o' cleanin' an' refinin' Oor hooses, streets, oor coorts an' closes, An' a' that hurts oor health an' noses; 'Bout chemistry, steam, gas, an' win', The vera lichtnin's luggit in, An' music, paintin', architecture, A' weel rede up in mony a lecture. We meet tae argue what we think, We meet tae cow that horrid drink, We meet tae read, recite, an' sing, An' mony a queer conceitie thing. Noo, wurkin' men yersel's respec', Nor leeve in ignorance an' neglec'; Ye've means, but want the wull tae use them, Ye whiles neglec', an' whiles abuse them; Ye hae nae time for e'en'in' classes; Ye've time tae drink, an' see the lasses— Staun at hoose-en, or change-hoose door, An' smoke, an' swear, an' raise a splore, An' play at cards, or fecht wi' dougs, An' whiles tae clout ilk ither's lugs; O wad ye no be muckle better, Tae read a beuk, or write a letter?

THE POWER AND BEAUTY OF SCOTTISH SONG. Wake every chord, strike every string, Diffuse harmonious raptures round; Ye foreign songsters warbling breathe The sweetest strains of vocal sound. Then, Scotia, pour thy native lays, All tender, simple, wildly sweet, Thy martial, mournful, lively airs, Where Beauty, Power, and Pathos meet. More rich, more sweet, more thrilling far Than German or Italian song; Wake, Scotia, wake thy mountain lyre, And roll the inspiring tide along. Oh! roll the glorious tide of song, Soft gushing o'er the melting heart, Till patriot Ardour, Mirth, and Love, Their warmest, brightest powers impart. When heart-warm tears eclipse thine eyes, When struggling raptures thrill thy breast, Be Scotia's peerless powers of song, In all their native charms, confessed. NIGHT SCENE AT THE FALL OF SEBASTOPOL. The toils, the flames, the thunders of the siege Are quench'd and hush'd. Night shrouds in funeral pall The fallen fortress, and her shattered mounds— Each rent and ruined fort, and crumbling wall. Like leaves in Autumn, drenched in pools of blood, Lie dead and dying; groans of anguish blend With smothered shrieks and moans; death-laden sighs Of long-drawn agony to Heaven ascend. By the doomed city's suicidal fires I see their ghastly features upward turned— See fixed and lustreless the glazing eye, That late with all the warrior's ardour burned. Not with my ears—I listen with my heart, And hear ten thousand wailing voices rise, And shrieks and sobs, and bursts of wildest woe, From hearts bereft and lorn, assail the skies. For them the festal cannon boom in vain, And joy-bells ring their peal from sea to sea, And mimic rockets blaze through midnight skies, And banners flaunt from hall, and tower, and tree. Be hushed, sad weepers, for your loved ones fell, As warriors still should fall, in Freedom's cause; For her they stormed the fort, and scaled the breach, Victorious died, and earned a world's applause. The Rubicon is passed. Pause not, go on To conquest fresh, and newer fields of fame: Ye brave Allies, may no dark influence mar The united glories of your arms and name! And yon gigantic idol of the North, Whose mighty limbs of mingled iron and clay Are trembling—tottering, soon will prostrate fall, A crumbling mass of ruin and decay. ON THE RUSSIAN WAR IN THE CRIMEA, 1854–5. “There's a divinity that shapes our ends, Rough hew them as we will.”— Shakspere. Behold with awe, and high adoring wonder, The living car of Heaven, on wheels of thunder, Flame and reverberate through the Eastern skies, Weak-sighted mortals, veil your dazzled eyes! Seek not to scan—attempt not to foreshow, By fancies vain, Heaven's vast designs below. The living wheels, instinct with spirit eyes, Roll onwards to their goal, let this suffice The curious mind and still the anxious soul. We see a part, but not the mighty whole. The mad ambition, and the wrath of man, Controlled, subjected to the sovereign plan Of an omniscient Providence, shall work Its ends by grasping Russ, and feeble Turk, By siege and storm, by battle height and plain, By lakes of blood and festering hills of slain, By allied nations rousing Europe broad— These are His tools, the mighty worker—God. And thou, my country, what hast thou attained? Some dear-bought triumphs. Ah! how soiled and stained, By needless waste of life on hostile soil, Where want and sickness, nakedness and toil, Mowed down whole legions of thy warrior braves, Their promised glories—nameless Crimean graves! Yet still with jealous love I'd guard thy name, And from the sunbright glories of thy fame Chase every shade, and wipe off every stain, The prestige of thy worth and power maintain. For not alone in battle's fateful hour Are seen and felt the triumphs of thy power; On higher, holier fields immortal Fame Hath crowned thy efforts, and embalmed thy name. Thy missioned hosts, full oft in bloodless fight The powers of darkness, with the arms of light, Have vanquished and dispersed. Triumphant songs, In every language, from ten thousand tongues, Rise from the North, the South, the mighty West, The fulgent East—they rise and call Thee blest. The herald thou o'er all the world abroad, To sound the advent of the Word of God. For this no banner flings its blazon round, No battle-charger, foaming, paws the ground, No shout, nor shock of war, no groans, nor cries, No garments rolled in blood speak to the skies, No courtly laureate strikes the jewelled lyre, And thrills the golden chords with tuneful fire. Yet Heaven proclaims, and earth repeats the strain, Britannia wars to loose, not bind the chain. RHYMES FOR THE TIMES. II. Ae day short syne, whan gaun afiel, A douce aul' farrant eldrin chiel Cam' yont the burn tae hae a crack, For John an' me hae lang been pack. Quo he, Thir's unco times we leeve in, There's muckle dune, ance past believin'. Hae ye no heard in Glasco College They've plantit a new tree o' knowledge? The frute's fu' bonny tae the e'e, An' woman's no forbid tae pree: Sae she may cum without presumption, An' pu' an' eat an' gather gumption. An' sic lang-wint, lang-nebbit cracks, 'Bout social rights, an' wrangs, an' facts, Frae chiels wi' tongues sae glib an' snell, They tingilit thro' ye like a bell. There's mony a phase o' speech an' thocht, Leuks gran', but whan it's tae be wrocht, An' practice, 'stead o' speech begins, There's stumilin'-blocks tae break oor shins, Ower whilk we'll stacher, stoit, an' tumile, Syne juist sit doon an' glunch an' grumil. Speech is a tree that bears nae frute, Till delvit and dungit aboot the rute. The yird weel loosit an' labourit, syne Leuk for a crap, baith big and fine. Whan words an' wark mak' firm alliance, Then social duty's social science. An' noo, that we hae dune wi' speakin', Fie let us tae the wark be streekin'. Aff wi' yer coat, up wi' yer sleeves, Set doon yer feet, an' ply yer neives. On, on, nae stanin' still, nor jaukin', Oor wark's ahin, hae dune wi' taukin'; For that's ane o' the richts o' woman, I houp her gude time's nearer comin'— Hech, there's a warl o' wark afore hir, An' Heaven an' yirth are leukin' o'er hir. Noo, John, quo I, haud aff oor taes, A woman best kens woman's ways: There's ae thing she can hardly name, A thing o' filth, an' sin, an' shame; Tae chack that ugsume kin' o' sinnin', She maun begin at the beginnin'. Nae lassie ere was born on yirth, But Nature gied hir, at hir birth, A shrinkin', shame-faced, modest pride, Hir baith as bairn an' maid tae guide. O mithers, guard this precious sense— This bashfu' modesty and mense, Sae sweet, but O ower scarce tae see. Yer warnin' words, an' watchfu' e'e, Sood never lea' them lang their lanes, Wi' ill brocht up, ill deedie weans. An' cleed their limbs wi' decent claes, A gey bit nearer tae the taes, An' aye the guileless bonny burds, Keep frae a' shamefu' sichts an' words. Ay, mithers, ye hae muckle mair Tae gie yer bairns than schulin' lear; At schule ye like tae see them braw, Wi' peenie white as drifted snaw, An' hoopit coatie, short an' wide, An' curls that hing on ilka side O' rosy cheeks an' lauchin' e'en, An' a' aboot them snod an' clean. This ye may dae, but let the min' An' wee bit hertie, saft an' kin', The mither's anxious luve an' care, An' eident teachin' foremaist share, An' let yer cares aye deeper grup, Whan they tae maidhood are grown up, An' tho' the wark war ne'er sae thrang, Ken wha they're wi', an' whaur they gang; Be tae yer duty leal an' true, An' sood ye fail, na blame tae you. There's been an unco tauk an' fyke 'Boot weemen's wark, an' things sic like. The shooster lasses, save the mark, They say sood hae the shopmen's wark, An' sort the teeps, an' wield the pen, An' blackneb on the wurkin' men. An' sood they get the pay an' place Men used tae hae, they'll hae the grace, By their glib mouth-piece Bessy Park, Tae tell the chiels whaur they'll get wark; They canna dig, tae beg think shame, They'll list, or seek a foreign hame. Noo, lasses, I wad hae ye ken, Tae herry oot the nice young men Is no' the gate to win their favour. By thrifty, modest, quiet behaviour, A wheen o' ye micht aiblains share A' that they wurk for evermair. An' are we cum tae sic a pass, That wark, an' meat, for mony a lass, Can no' be had in oor bit islan', But by her health or morals spoilin'? Then let ilk toon oot thro' the nation Subscribe for female emigration, Tae tak' them far frae wants an' harms, Tae lan's whaur woman's presence charms An' blesses men, whase lanely lives An' lanely hames hae need o' wives. Ae word tae speechifyin' weemen, That's no aye sleepin' whan they're dreamin', Aye takin' up puir woman's quarrels, Let your first care be woman's morals; For social ills, an' deeds impure, Prevention easier is than cure. Help mithers wi' their maiden charge, Help lassies coosten oot at large Upon a warl' baith caul an' stern, Wi' muckle baith tae thole and learn. An' since ye've time an' win' tae spare, Them baith on sister woman ware, Tae touch her heart, an' teach her saul, This mission's yours—obey the call. LINES ON THE TRIAL OF MADELINE SMITH FOR THE MURDER OF L'ANGELIER. Shade of the hapless stranger, lost L'Angelier, Whose life's young light was quenched in guilt and shame, Say haunts thou still the lane, the fatal gate, Where to thy arms the fair, false syren came? We seek not now thy “merits to disclose, Nor draw thy frailties from their dread abode;” We would not sit in judgment on the man Whose soul hath stood before the bar of God. Not proven was thy thrice-repeated deed— Thou of the stony heart and dauntless eye: Smile not, in Heaven's high court thou yet shalt hear The unerring, proven verdict of the sky. A lovely isle lies cradled in the deep, Its flowery glades embowered in fruitful trees, A weeping mother wanders on the beach And pours her sorrows on the seaward breeze. Ah! to her widowed heart, her only son, She last had clasped upon that island shore; He came, he saw, he loved, he sinned, he died— We wait till heaven and time shall tell us more. VERSES ON THE CALDER IN ITS COURSE BY ST. ENOCH'S, ROSEHALL, &amp;c. Lone Calder! sweet Calder! beloved of my youth, When Nature I worshipped with fervour and truth; Sweet memories float like a beautiful dream O'er thy musical woodlands and murmuring stream. 'Tis fifty long years sincé, and now as I range Thy flower-spangled margin, alas, for the change! My youthful companions, ah! where have ye fled? Sweet, sad voices whisper, They sleep with the dead. Bright, golden-haired Bella, dear, delicate Anne, And warm-hearted Jessie, how swiftly ye ran Down the dell of the hyacinth your cousin to meet, And guide through the Calder her small, shrinking feet! Then o'er thy green holms we went bounding along, And woke up the echoes with laughter and song; With freedom and sunshine, with birds, and with flowers, And young hearts all joyous, how swift sped the hours! Dear Jessie, thou only, of all the blithe train, Art left—shall I ever behold thee again? Thy pale, gentle mother went early to rest, And her dear ones soon followed to sleep on her breast. Sweet sylvan, St Enoch's fond mem'ry recalls Sweet voices, fair faces, that dwelt in thy halls— 'Tis long since they left, and the stranger possessed The home of their fathers—the dearest, the best. From thy desolate chambers, Oh lonely Rosehall! The dwellers have vanished—“the steed from the stall;” The hearts that have loved thee and owned thee are dust, And thy chill halls are tarnished with mildew and rust. Though garlands of poesy entwine not thy brow, Nor bard in soft numbers thy charms will avow; Yet, Calder, a muse that is nameless will bring A song that is nameless thy beauties to sing. OOR LOCATION. A hunner funnels bleezin', reekin', Cóal an' ironstane charrin', smeekin'; Navvies, miners, keepers, fillers, Puddlers, rollers, iron millers; Reestit, reekit, raggit laddies, Firemen, enginemen, an' paddies; Boatmen, banksmen, rough and rattlin', 'Bout the wecht wi' colliers battlin', Sweatin', swearin', fechtin' drinkin', Change-house bells an' gill-stoups clinkin'; Police—ready men and willin'— Aye at han' whan stoups are fillin', Clerks, an' counter-loupers plenty, Wi' trim moustache and whiskers dainty— Chaps that winna staun at trifles, Min' ye they can han'le rifles. 'Bout the wives in oor location, An' the lassies' botheration, Some are decent, some are dandies, An' a gey wheen drucken randies, Aye tae neebors' hooses sailin', Greetin' bairns ahint them trailin', Gaun for nouther bread nor butter, Just tae drink an' rin the cutter. Oh, the dreadfu' curse o' drinkin'! Men are ill, but tae my thinkin', Lukin' through the drucken fock, There's a Jenny for ilk Jock. Oh the dool an' desolation, An' the havoc in the nation, Wrocht by dirty, drucken wives! Oh hoo mony bairnies' lives Lost ilk year through their neglec'; Like a millstane roun' the neck O' the strugglin', toilin' masses Hing drucken wives an' wanton lassies. Tae see sae mony unwed mithers Is sure a shame that taps a' ithers. An' noo I'm fairly set a-gaun, On baith the whisky-shop and pawn; I'll speak my min'—and whatfor no? Frae whence cums misery, want, an' wo, The ruin, crime, disgrace, an' shame, That quenches a' the lichts o' hame? Ye needna speer, the feck ot's drawn Out o' the change-hoose an' the pawn. Sin and death, as poets tell, On ilk side the doors o' hell Wait tae haurl mortals in; Death gets a' that's catcht by sin: There are doors whaur death an' sin Draw their tens o' thoosan's in; Thick and thrang we see them gaun, First the dram-shop, then the pawn; Owre a' kin's o' ruination, Drink's the king in oor location. THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA. Ah, bannered stars and stripes! your glory Hath paled, the blazoned folds all gory With kindred blood hang sadly drooping; The eagle and the vulture swooping Scream o'er the Run, that field inglorious Whence legs, not arms, returned victorious, Whipped back like beaten fillibusters To fresh discipline, drills, and musters. Ah, Uncle Sam! think what you're doing; Your case is hopeless on reviewing. You want the Anglo-Saxon pluck, Your forte is just to run a muck With pistol ball or bowie knife, And use your heels to save your life. And then your Budgets' awful figures, An income tax with all its rigours To pay the piper, you must bear it, But that you will, or can, I fear it; And if from this unhallowed strife You part not but with parting life, You must attain the dire conclusion Through seas of blood, debt, and confusion. You guess the Britishers are laughing At your disasters—that your chaffing Has raised the British lion's dander. That noble beast disdains to pander To your o'erweening pride and bluster; He calmly eyes your martial muster, And watchful, couching on his rock, Fearless abides the coming shock. Sammy, your case is very shocking, Too serious to admit of joking— By joint consent, or arbitration, Get an immediate separation— And statesmen choose of mark and mettle Your plaguey boundary lines to settle. Your horrid war is ought but civil, And soon will breed all sorts of evil To name and credit, trade and dollar, To whites and blacks, in chain and collar. Adieu! be civil to your mammy— Britain, you know, good Master Sammy. EPITHALAMIUM ON THE MARRIAGE OF GEORGE BAIRD OF STRICHEN AND CECILIA HATTON. Fill high the cup, but not with wine— The cup of joy; bring flowers and twine A wreath to crown the gentle Bride, Who, flushed with love and tender pride, Leans on her Bridegroom's arm. For he hath given, with fervid breath, To her his vows of love and faith; And she hath pledged him true and dear. A thousand welcomes wait them here— True hearts, and wishes warm. Ring out the joy-bells far and wide, Bid festal guns salute the Bride, Fling out the streamers far and free, Fair Stranger, hail!—all joy to thee Within thy northern home. Ah, gentle Lady! do not deem That smoke, and flame, and hissing steam, And clang of iron, and rushing wheel, Are all we see, and hear, and feel. Not so—not so. We come To where the sacred fane uprears Its stately tower—and where appears The structure fair where learning sheds Her beams on thousand youthful heads, To bless and to adorn. See, through these ample halls below, Full tides of youth and childhood flow; There Music swells, and Temperance reigns, And Peace her sacred rule maintains, Of law and order born. The cup brims high—but not with wine; 'Tis with a nectar more divine— The dew of love, the balm of life, The wedded bliss of man and wife. Fill high! The draught is rich and rare. Drink deep. Heaven bless the happy pair! SOME INCIDENTS IN THE LATTER DAYS OF JOHN WHITELAW Some time of Stand, in the parish of New Monkland, who, being in arms at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge, was afterwards under hiding for four years, when he was taken, and suffered death in front of the old jail of Edinburgh in November, 1683. Written by one of his descendants. The bridge was won, the foe had crossed The Clyde; the Covenanted host Had lost the day, and vanquished fled. Mixed with the rout a horseman sped— For life he rode—and glancing back, Saw the dragoons were on his track; With thundering hoof and foaming flank, The steed swept on till Clyde's green bank He gained, there for a moment stood, Then plunged into the rolling flood. A swimmer strong, he safely bore His rider to the northern shore. Refreshed and cool the stalwart steed, As if he knew his master's need, Sprang down the bank, dashed o'er the plain, His northward course pursued amain. The rider never drew his hand Till at the lonely farm of “Stand.” On Monkland moor his weary horse He reined, and stayed his faltering course. But, ah! the terror and alarm That reigned within that lonely farm, The fatal news he need not tell, Alas! they guessed it all too well. He clasped his pale and fainting wife, Whose bosom held a twofold life, He soothed his children, set to watch His eldest girl, that he might snatch A hasty meal and brief repose, Then he must hide him from his foes. Through four dark years of fear and peril Young Margaret, that heroic girl, Watched o'er his life, purveyed his food, Until he sealed the truth with blood. There came a day when weak, forlorn, The mother lay, her babe new born Within her arms, a fearful sound Of trampling hoofs the dwelling round Smote on her ear. With clanking tread Two fierce dragoons approached her bed. They asked her where her husband hid. She bravely answered, “God forbid That I should heaven and him betray.” They swore they'd kill her where she lay. They thrust their swords into the bed, And dragged the pillows from her head. Then from the fire a peat they snatch, And laid it smouldering on the thatch. Then rode away with fell desire To see the lonely house on fire. It burned not, and that babe and mother Lived long to bless and love each other. They took and tried him; calm he stood Before the men who sought his blood. “He was at Bothwell with a sword, He owned not James his loyal lord, Of Sharp's late murder he declined To say what thoughts were in his mind.” This he confessed, and suffered death With martyr zeal and steadfast faith. Once lonely “Stand,” the martyr's prayer At morn and e'en rose on the air To heaven; the music of the psalm Rose sweet amid the holy calm Of Scotland's Sabbath—sweetly still The lonely farm, the moor, the hill, Save moorfowls' call and anthem loud Of warbling lark on summer cloud. Alas! the change, sight, sound, and speech, Another sadder moral teach! MOTHER AND CHILD. “Away from the dwellings of care-worn men The waters are sparkling in wood and glen— Away from the chamber and dusky hearth The young leaves are dancing in breezy mirth, Their light stems thrill to the wild wood strain, And youth is abroad in my green domain.” —Hemans. O come, little Mary, the woods are in tune With the birds and the breezes of bright sunny June, For the brook in the woodland to-day we are bound, With green leaves above us and blossoms around. To chase the swift minnow, and plash in the stream, Pick sorrel and flowers on its margin that gleam, And weave with green rushes a coronet fair To crown thy white brow and thy long, shining hair. Now warble thy wood-notes, sweet bird of my heart, All Nature rejoices, and thou must take part In her hymn'd adorations, and raise thy soft eyes To thy Father who dwells in yon blue shining skies. How lovely the mingling of leaflet and flower! How sweet the wild music in woodland and bower! More lovely the gaze of thy worshipping eyes, And sweeter to heaven shall thine anthem arise. On this soft, mossy bank, where a queen might recline, Where wild rose and hawthorn their branches entwine, Come seat thee, and listen the song of the thrush While the breeze rocks his young in their green cradle bush. Be grateful, dear Mary, what blessings are thine!— Kind parents on earth, and a Father divine, The beauties of Nature, the riches of grace, The kingdom of heaven, and the light of His face. SONG—THE COUTHIE AULD MAN. Wi' a blush, an' a glint o' true luve frae her e'e, Her bonnie white haunie, sae saft an' sae wee, A' trem'lin' she laid in my braid, waukit loof: I'm yours, John, for ever—tak that for the proof. My heart it gaed duntin'; Oh funeuch and fain Was I whan I ca'd the dear lassock my ain; An' the saft haun I chirted, and pree'd the wee mou' Sae rosy an' rich wi' luve's sweet honey-dew. The auld wife consented, the auld man an a', Tae gie me their dochter, an' blest was my fa'; Tho' my luve an' their blessin' was a' the bride's gear, We've throught weel an' thriven this mony a year. We ha'e a bit mailin wi' whilk we can fen, We've sax bonnie bairns grown to women an' men,— My lassocks are winsome, an' warkrife, an' douce, An' my callans, gude sain them, are stoops o' the hoose. An' noo the white haunie is runkled and lean, An' dim is the licht in the luve glintin' een, An' the rich rosy lips noo are wallow't and wan, But they're aye just as sweet to the couthie auld man. REMONSTRANCE. “One murder makes a villain, millions a hero; and number sanctifies the crime.”—Young. With mournful eyes, and folded hands, And listening ear, Britannia stands— No counsel gives, makes no demands— 'Twere vain, for transatlantic lands Scorn Europe's intervention. She gazes o'er the western deep— She can but pray, she can but weep; There War's red eye doth never sleep— His bloodiest revels Death doth keep— Men shrink their deeds to mention. Oh glorious land! to thee are given The richest gifts of bounteous heaven; But thou, by lust of empire driven, Hast blindly, madly, vainly striven, 'Gainst Southern secession. You may not, will not, cannot gain Your object; not as one, but twain, The North and South must now remain— Let weeping Peace not sue in vain For entrance and possession. Ye live, and fight, and fall beneath A lurid cloud of blood and death; The atmosphere that feeds your breath Smells rank; your victories claim a wreath Of cypress, not of laurel. Awake! no more of conquest dream; The State boat's on Niagara's stream— She nears the rapids—it would seem That she must perish while you dream Of triumph in the quarrel. Let mercy, prudence, common sense, Ply oar and helm, and shape from thence Her course—their presence will dispense A healthy, healing influence, Your deadly wounds to close. What profit should ye gain a world And lose a soul? Your flag unfurled Ten thousand souls to darkness hurled, And yet you have not gained a world, But thousand thousand woes. OLD MEMORIES. Bright flashes of sunshine—sweet snatches of song— Warm gushings of kindness, come thrilling along The chords of old memories, melting the tone, And sweet the weird voices of years that are gone. I hear the brisk hum of the dear spinning wheel; Again, the kind hand of Old Granny I feel, As she strokes down my hair, singing soft, as I stood By her side, the “Blaeberries” or “Babes of the Wood.” I see my dear village—it basks in the sun; And the barefooted children, that tumble and run On the pathway—the rattle of looms, and the song Of the weaver, that sounded the summer day long. Again, a gay party of youngsters I meet, Dressed out in their best, two and two on the street; 'Tis a large penny wedding—the fiddler before Plays gaily 'midst firing and merry uproar. On the Sovereign's birth-day every cot was a bower; The birch wore its greenest—the broom was in flower; Each window was dressed with its neighbour to match, And the wealth of the woodlands hung low from the thatch. Then Wilkes, John Wilkes, a demagogue M.P. in the reign of George the Third. shoulder high, through the village was borne By the boys, with sound of the whistle and horn— With a tin pail for drum; on the old beechen tree They hanged, and then burned, the old scarecrow with glee. Again my flower treasures I see in their prime: Nancy-pretty, sweet Willy, white lilies and thyme, Appleringy and spearmint—the old folk's delight— With bachelor's buttons both yellow and white. The old churchyard often I wander around— Oft passing to stoop o'er a lone grassy mound; The dear ones who left me are waiting below, Nor long will I tarry—'tis time I should go. No gay garden roses plant ye on my grave— A briar from the banks of sweet Calder I crave, With its flush of wild roses to curtain my bed, Where the robin a requiem will sing o'er my head. SPRING SCENE IN THE COUNTRY. Singing, skipping, shaking back Curls of gold, or brown, or black, From soft cheeks and laughing eyes— Careless, gay as butterflies— Comes a fair and girlish band Bearing flowers in lap and hand; Golden coltsfoot, primrose pale, Hyacinths from woody vale; Yellow willow buds, that smell Of the wild bee's honeyed cell; Daisies, dandelion's strung, Round each neck and bosom hung. Sweet and swift run childhood's hours, Spent with streams, and trees, and flowers; One leads on a prattling brother, Baby sister bears another, Oft resigned to willing arms— Girls still doat on infant charms; How they hug and kiss her, crowing Babe, with health and beauty glowing. Your sweet voices, dear wee lassies, O'er my heart like music passes; Bonnetless and barefoot dancing, On your homeward path advancing. Ah, your homes! your state is lowly, But your mission, high and holy Shall be in the future, when, Mothers ye of future men, Wield a power within the nation, In the work of education, Which priests and sages, Peers and Commons, Cannot wield—that power is woman's. 'Tis not meetings, speeches, grants, Laying bare the crimes and wants Of your juvenile offenders— But the fact experience tenders, That the power above all others Youth to train is this, good mothers! AULD SCOTLAN' AT THE LAYING OF THE FOUNDATION STONE OF THE WALLACE MONUMENT AT STIRLING, 1861. Auld Scotlan's hert an' baith her lugs war dirlin', Whan thun'erin' waves o' soun' gade rowin', swirlin' Aroun' the Abbey Craig o' auld grey Stirling, Frae hunner music ban's and bag-pipes skirlin'. Oh! blithe was she tae see her buirdly callans In tens o' thousands pourin' frae their dwallin's, Baith Dukes and Lords, an' mony trades an' callin's— Oh! prood was she, an' big her fu' hert swallin's. Wi' cheers the verra lift amaist was riven, Frae mornin's drumlie broo the clouds war driven; The sun cam' lauchin' oot—sair had he striven Tae see us frae the twal-oors hight o' heaven. An' sic a sicht his e'e o' fire ne'er saw, Cam' Kirk, cam' State, cam' “Army, Physic, Law;” Leddies an' lassies, bonny burdies a', An mony gawsy wives, baith braid an' braw. The lowe o' freedom burns sae het an' clear In Scotlan's hert this mony hunner year, That, spite o' traitor Scot or Southern jeer, Tae Wallace name this tower o' strength she'll rear. An' by his treacherous doom, whilk aye she'll murne, An' by the Bruce, an' by red Bannockburn— Tae your immortal memories she will turn For ever—Wallace, Bruce, an' Bannockburn. IMPENDING WAR BETWEEN AUSTRIA AND SARDINIA. Hark! the impatient dogs of war, Growling, baying from afar, The royal ban-dogs, bound and strain To slip the leash or snap the chain. The scent lies strong, and staunch and fleet, With instinct true, the bloody feet Of murderous War they seek to trace, Till Europe's broad and tranquil face, With wounds and blood, and burning tears, Mangled, deformed, and soiled, appears. The Austrian bloodhound whets his fangs, His war steeds neigh, his armour clangs; His marching myriads shake the ground, And doubt and terror hover round. His savage muzzle yet is wet With Magyar blood. When I forget Thee, gallant Hungary, may my name Become a mark for hate and shame. The Imperial hound, he first gave tongue When Cherbourg's forts with viva's rung— When yelled the pack, when colonels stood And licked their chops at thoughts of blood. Down, down ye dogs, will nought allay Your thirst for blood? Away, away; Balls, hunts, reviews, are harmless things Compared with war—the game of kings. Victor, God grant thou prove thy name! Alas, good dog! on thee the blame They cast of all these warlike coils; For thou wouldst rend the despot's toils That hold the Lombard's writhing form, But Hapsburg's demon rides the storm. Alone, thou wield'st nor spell nor charm Of power to break his red right arm. Britannia, on her island rock, Stands armed and watching for the shock. If shock must come, heaven scatter far The thunder-cloud, the storm of war! ON THE DEPARTURE OF THE BARQUE “FAME” FROM GLASGOW TO AUSTRALIA WITH EMIGRANTS, 1854. Go, barque of promise, prove thy name, Not on the deck, where dead and dying Have steeped in blood the wreath of fame, To her loud trump with groans replying. Not where the huge war steamer plys, Through hostile seas resistless sweeping, Led in her wake her battle prize, To port her course triumphant keeping. Not such the freight, not such the fame, Old Scotia o'er the world of waters Sends with her virtues and her name— She sends her own true sons and daughters. She sends, Australia, to thy plains, White with the woolly millions feeding— Brave hearts, strong arms to probe thy veins, With treasure gold so freely bleeding. Her Christian faith, her moral worth, Her honest pride, her patriot feelings She gives, and sends her children forth, With trust in God and Time's revealings. God speed thee, “Fame!” may each loved name Of absent friends sweet memories nourish; Our prayers are yours, with tears we claim This last fond wish—“Let Glasgow Flourish.” ADVICE TAE BRITHER JONATHAN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CEEVIL WAR IN AMERICA. Frien' Jonathan, tak' gude advice, an' fast as eer ye dow, Fling doon the lunt o' ceevil war, pit oot the eerie lowe That scowthers, wi' its hatefu' heat, your vera hert an' saul; Ye've gather't sticks tae beat the bleeze, sae water't till its caul'. There's muckle cry an' little woo in a' your fechtin' wark; Ye dinna like a crackit croon, nor yet a bloody sark; Tae tyne your trade, tae tyne your gear, an' spill your bluid forby, Ye canna thole, sae jist gae hame an' fling the rifle by. I guess the new Palmetto flag, an' eke the Stripes an' Stars, On Crimean or Italian plains, or rebel Indian wars, Wad waver't in your 'prentice haun, ye blusterin' haveral chiel; If ye maun fecht, just fecht at hame, ye maunna gang a-fiel'. Wow, man, your in an awfu' mess; what outget sall ye hae? The hill Difficulty's afore, an' ye maun speel the brae; Ye'll naither pay, nor fecht, nor 'gree, but wow your gude o' bragging— Far better cut the finger aff than aye tae hae it wagging. 'Twixt North and South, that ill-matcht pair, there's nocht but aggravation, Sae, e'er ye ding a' things tae rack, gar mak a separation; The South they'll keep the negro slave—they like the chain and collar— The North tae trade, an' rug, an' reive, an' pouch the michty dollar. CONTRASTED SCENES FROM REAL LIFE. SCENE I.—MARRIAGE OF SIR R. PEEL WITH LADY E. HAY. See yonder gorgeous fane, its doors expand, Throng'd with the rank, wealth, beauty of the land; And high-born bridesmaids, with a beauteous bride, Are there, the titled bridegroom by her side. And diamonds flash, and white plumes wave between, And lustrous silks, and robes of satin sheen, And snowy clouds of richest, rarest lace Float round rare forms of loveliness and grace. Earl and countess, lord and lady fair, Wait at the altar the hymeneal pair. The vows are spoken, and a husband's kiss Has sealed the pledge of wedded love and bliss— And kisses, blessings, smiles on every side, Are showered upon the fair and noble bride. She, blushing, tearful as a dewy rose, Leans on the arm belov'd as forth she goes To mount her gilded chariot, swift away For home, and love whirls on the cortege gay. Ah, happy bride! though now to thee is given Earth's best and brightest; at the throne of heaven The meanest female of the human race Shall occupy with thee an equal place. SCENE II.—THE INCIDENT IS TAKEN FROM “HOUSEHOLD WORDS.” 'Tis night in London—dimly gleam the lamps Through murky fogs and chilly, drizzling damps; Tenacious mud o'erspreads the slimy street, And clogs the walker's slow exploring feet. But 'tis not time, nor place, nor scene, nor hour, Can damp the soul that owns sweet Pity's power, Nor bid from scenes of want and woe depart, Nor freeze the founts of love that warm the heart. Go on, large-hearted Son of Genius, go! Look till thy heart is pained, thine eyes o'erflow. Oh! 'tis a sight to sicken and appal, Crouched on the miry stones, against the wall Of yon dark pile, five huddled masses lean, But sight, nor sound, nor form of life is seen. Lift up the shrouding rags—a female face Is seen; there human feeling leaves no trace; A dreary blank is o'er the features spread— The very sense of want and pain is dead; Excess of misery all her powers hath numbed, And 'neath the crushing load she hath succumbed; And who, and what art thou? and who are those That round thee crouch in torpor—not repose? With feeble voice she spoke, and eyes half-closed: I know them not, save that we were exposed Three wintry nights—back from the workhouse driven— Like things accursed of men, and lost to heaven! Knowest thou the farthest twain—with arms entwined Like broken images—their heads reclined Each on the other? Sisters young, they say, To Destitution's darkest ills a prey. And who the next? She from the country came, And found no choice of life but want or shame. Dickens, thy graphic pencil paints with power The crimes, the follies, and the woes that lower And taint our moral atmosphere; still lend Thy potent aid—be still the outcast's friend! THE MOTHER AT HOME. A voice deep and solemn is sounding abroad; Oh mothers of Britain! each humble abode Should echo the burden with which it is fraught— Our children, they must be instructed and taught. Oh mothers of Scotland! I call you by name, I bid you arise and rescue your fair fame; Let your eyes trickle down like a fountain of tears, For young ones neglected through crime-shrouded years. Oh poor peasant mother—Oh working man's wife! Your child's food and clothing, his health and his life Should be toiled for, and cared for, as only a part Of your duty; Oh culture his mind and his heart! Your cares are full many, your leisure is small, But the souls of your babes are more precious than all; While you toil with your hands you should watch, teach, and pray, For where there's a will there is ever a way! Oh mothers! your prayers, instructions, and rules, With the voice of the teacher, and lore of the schools, Should ever be joined, and when faithfully given, You may hope, you may trust, in the blessing of Heaven. The statesman, the patriot, the Christian, have found— Though grants, schools, and teachers increase and abound— For juvenile ignorance and vice there must come, Best help, truest cure, from the Mother at Home. SWEET MAY MORN. 'Tis sweet May morn; wake, drowsy girls! Come ere the sun has stolen the pearls— The dewy pearls—that glisten sheen On May's soft lap, and mantle green. Come bare-foot, come, each little lass With crystal dew 'mong flowery grass Bathe hands and feet, till all aglow, And gaily o'er your shoulders throw The shining drops, with dew-filled palm, Lave cheek and brow, 'tis Beauty's balm. Hail, sweet May morn! from tree and bush The piping blackbird, singing thrush, The lark, whose joyous carol loud Rings from the dewy vernal cloud; The cooing dove, the cawing rook, The skimmers of the lake and brook, Spring's sweetest voice—her own cuckoo— A tuneful homage, loving true, Are tendering at thy flowery throne, In many a sweetly varied tone. See, girls! the day advances, come Light tripping o'er the daisies home, Already is the cottage board With creamy bowls of May-milk stored; Rich foaming jugs—but not of ale— Warm, fragrant, from the milk-maid's pail, From hand to hand are circling round, With health, and sweets delicious crowned; Sweet simple joys, sweet balmy draught, With health, and peace, and temperance fraught. Dear little maids! your self-styled bard Would deem it dear and rich reward, If, when in blushing maidhood's hour, And armed with love and beauty's power, That love, that power, you'd bring to bear On each fond youth who loves you dear; And when he breathes the fond desire To call you his, you would require The temperance pledge, with that of love— His love, his truth, and worth to prove, And gain, for all you have resigned, A happy home—a husband kind! ON THE PROPOSED PRESENTATION OF GUNS BY THE PEOPLE OF BRITAIN TO THE KING OF SARDINIA, IN AID OF ITALIAN LIBERTY. No gold,—no jewels bright, We offer at the shrine Where Italy adores the light Of liberty divine. A sterner gift we bring— Ye frowning tubes of death, Your bolts of vengeance wing, Till tyrants quail beneath. From fort—from “deadly breach” Pour from your sulph'rous throats, As far as sound can reach, In loud prophetic notes, A voice whose thunder tones Shall Europe's despots wake, And on their crumbling thrones In craven terror shake. Victor Emmanuel!—name Of augury divine— Thee victor we proclaim! For Freedom's cause is thine. “Emmanuel—God with us”— Of old, was Piedmont's cry— Emmanuel ever thus Be God to aid thee nigh! TO THE NORTH AMERICANS. “O foolish people, and unwise,” Who stop your ears and shut your eyes, Though common-sense and flagrant facts Proclaim the madness of your acts! A guessing, calculating nation, Yet, to European observation, To be outwitted and defeated, You never guessed or calculated. We guess the cost you should have counted Before the war-horse you had mounted, On which you cut such sorry capers. You want our Campbells, Havelocks, Napiers, Our Gladstone, Palmerston, and Russell, And so you've got into a bustle Of debt and danger, blood and battery, And no mendacious boast or flattery Can chase the clouds so darkly looming, Or still the wailing echoes booming Above, around the deathly track To Richmond, and the red path back. Look back—the trench, the swamp, the wood, With dead and dying bodies strewed; And nightly on thy banks, St James, Were hundreds piled to feed the flames; Then battle, panic, rout, and flight, And all is terror and affright. Ye know not all; ye soon shall know, When dark reaction's tidal flow Shall chill your hearts, and whelm your pride And lust of empire in the tide. Oh Union dames! let common-sense, If not affection, influence Your thoughts and words before high Heaven— Such right to woman is not given, To urge her husband, son, or lover, All human ties to trample over The cause. To keep the Union whole, Alas! full many a parted soul In battle, sinful, unforgiven, Flies to its last account to heaven. Then let religion, reason, love, Your holiest, dearest, feelings move. Your love, your eloquence, your tears, All that on man's best feelings bears, Employ, nor let your efforts cease Till your fair land has rest and peace. CRINOLINE. Auld Scotlan' gangs yirmin an' chanerin' alane; She wunners whaur a' her trig lassocks ha'e gane; She's trampit the kintra, an' socht thro' the toons, An' fan' the fule hizzies—blawn oot like balloons! Can they be my lassocks—ance cozie an' cosh, Weel shapit, weel happit—sae stumpy an' tosh? Twa coats an' a toush, or a goon, ye may ween, Were boukie aneuch, wi' what nature had gi'en. They're aye i' my e'e, an' they're aye i' my gate— At the kirk I am chirtit maist oot o' my seat; Whan caul', tae the ingle I needna gae ben, If Kate an' her crinoline's on the fire-en'. Whan a lad wi' a lassie forgethers yenoo, It's no her bricht een, or her rosie wee mou', Her snod cockernony, waist jimpy an' fine, That first tak's his e'e—it's the big crinoline! Tae sae that he likes it would jist be a lee— But ye ken that the big thing attracts aye the wee— An' the lass that cares nocht 'bout her heart an' her heid, Tak's care that her crinoline's weel spread abreed. An' say, if dame Nature wad gi'e at her birth, Tae ilka wee lassie that's born on the yirth, A bouk o' her ain, that grew bigger ilk year, Ye'd no be sae prood o' the giftie I fear. When a widow was burnt i' the Indian suttees, Tae honour the dead, and the fause gods tae please, The puir heathen body I'm pincht tae accuse, Whan I read o' they crinoline deaths i' the news. Sae aff wi' the whalebone, the cane, an' the steel! I likna the crinoline, trouth an' atweel; It's fule-like an' fashous, it's cheatrie an' boss— I wad jist ha'e yere cleedin' bien, genty, an' doss. WOMAN. There is an element of power That suits the needs of every hour— All wants to which our state gives birth— The life, the mind, the home, the hearth. 'Tis Woman, From the mother's breast The babe draws life and strength and rest; She soothes its pains, its wants supplies, With yearning love in heart and eyes. A prudent, gentle, loving wife, The boon most precious to the life Of him to whom her all is given, Save love of God, and hope of heaven. And who shall teach the infant mind The way of truth and peace to find? Who teach in wisdom's paths to tread, But she who gives his daily bread? A guiding star, to shed and shine Soft radiance on the household shrine, And from her sphere—a span of earth— Pour light and love on home and hearth. And such should Woman ever prove— The pole-star of domestic love, To which the youthful circle tend, As mother, guardian, teacher, friend. There is an element of ill— Of power to soil, deface, and kill The buds, the flowers, the fruits of life— The careless mother, worthless wife. O careless mother, why neglect The early buds of vice to check In your untutored boys and girls, Ere cast on life—its sins and perils? Your children's blood you would not shed; Yet, cruel mother, on your head The blood of souls uncared-for lies— That blood to heaven for ever cries. Oh, woe for him who finds on earth No spot so dreary as the hearth Where sits the partner of his life, A shrewish, wasteful, worthless wife! O Woman, much to thee is given— Thy mission comes direct from heaven; The priceless gems of human life— A careful mother, virtuous wife. DIRGE FOR JESSIE MACPHERSON. Sad Winter weeps, his tears bedew thy grave, That grave on which no kindred sorrows flow; The wailing winds around it moan and rave, Oh! lonely grave, where mourners never go! Thy mangled form, wrapped in its bloody shroud, Forgotten lies; few hearts, few eyes, will melt For thee, poor victim. The press-ridden crowd Have for thy cruel fate small pity felt. O night of horror, when the murder fiend Hacked out thy life, and revelled in thy gore; With felon hand thy wardrobe's treasures gleaned, And left her bloody footprints on the floor! Yet heaven and earth were stirred, regions beneath Were moved t' avert the proven murderer's doom; Sensation journals, libellous in their wrath 'Gainst law and justice, foam, and rave, and fume. The eye of Heaven beheld the fearful deed, The ear of Heaven received the victim's cry; 'Tis Heaven's command, let earth give rev'rent heed, The murder prove, and let the murderer die. Nay, though another should have shared the guilt Of this most foul and most ferocious deed, Yet she is guilty of the blood thus spilt— Justice accepts no offering in her stead. Rest, murdered Jessie, on thy lowly grave Shall ne'er be writ the branded felon's doom; Rest thou in peace, though madmen storm and rave, Thou hear'st them not—peace shades thy lonely tomb. LINES ADDRESSED TO A FRIEND ON RECEIVING FROM HIM A VOLUME OF “THE PARNASSUS JOURNAL.” Owre a Parnassus I hae wannert, Wi' beuk in han' I slowly daunert, An aft baith hert an' een gade dancin' Abune some bricht rock-crystal glancin' Amang the stanes or in the soil, That weel repaid me for my toil. Tae tell the truth, I didna ettle Tae fin' sae muckle bardic metal, Or pouch sae mony bonny gems Amang the heather cowes an' stems That cleed oor Scotch Parnassian mountain, Adoon whilk rins Castalia's fountain. It's ca'd, ye ken, the Muses' Spring, Whaur drouthy poets drink and sing, Ere fame or fortune's haun' ye claucht, Ye first maun tak' a waly-waucht O' this same sang-inspirin' water— An' syne ye'll ryhme, an' sing, an' clatter. A waly-waucht gat Ayrshire Rab— It cleart his thrapple, cool't his gab, An syne sae loud an' sweet he sang, That a' the warl' wi' echoes rang, Till on that kittle steed Pegasus, He wan the tap o' mount Parnassus; An' there he sits, an' wha wull steer him? Nae ither singer e'er cam' near him— Frae 'neath the yirth, or on't abune, Nane e'er could lilt tae Rabbie's tune. For me I ne'er cou'd fill my caup Oot o' the spring—a wee bit drap Was a' that e'er gade owre my weasan— E'en noo my gab begins to geysan, An' sae I fin' it maist expedient That I should say yer maist obedient. NOVEMBER FINDINGS—1862. Thou frigid tyrant, dark and stern November! We shrink before thee, and shall long remember Thy levin fires, untimely thunder volleys, That in dread tones rebuked our crimes and follies. Thy scowling eyes through veiling cloud are glaring On the pale face of Nature rudely baring, Her shivering form her leafy garments strewing O'er field and wood-discoloured heaps of ruin. Earth's blasted treasures shrunken, blackened lie On many a field beneath thy cruel eye; Red grave-yards swell o'er many little heaps— Her buried treasures the pale mother weeps. The factory wheels—too oft the wheels of life— Stand still; and pining wants and woes are rife; On the cold hearth, and by the naked bed, Gaunt misery cowering sits—half-warmed, half-fed. Friend Jonathan is just as fierce and spiteful— The braggadocio would be quite delightful— But loss of blood, and jaundiced bile, poor fellow, Have made him giddy, and all objects yellow. Thou drear November! in thy reign we saw A press-blown clamour overcrow the law— A secret conclave trample Justice down, Beneath the shelter of Victoria's crown. But now let rigours of the season move To generous sympathy and deeds of love: So that the poor have cause long to remember With gratitude even thee, dark stern November. OCTOBER THOUGHTS—1862. A solemn, tender melancholy— A soft emotion, sweet and holy; A sense of stillness and repose, O'er my worn heart and spirit flows. I feel the breathing calm that lies On earth, and sea, and sleeping skies, Upon the yellow voiceless woods, Where fading Nature mournful broods; The stubble-field, brown, silent, bare— Not even a gleaner wandering there. I seem by the death-couch to stand Of some grey Father of the land, Whose fading hue, and failing breath, And voiceless lips, give sign of death. And hark! 'mid twilight shadows dim, The robin chaunts his funeral hymn. Now, o'er the landscape slowly sailing— Robes of mist around her trailing— Comes the Night, bright, mild, and gracious; Through the blue ethereal spacious, Walks the full-orbed moon in splendour— Chaste, serene, and meekly tender. Dost thou gaze—Heaven's fairest daughter— On western fields of cruel slaughter; Fall thy beams, with weeping grace, On many a pale and gory face, In purple pools of blood reflected— Whence peace and mercy fly rejected? Dost thou, beauteous orb benign, On the patriot captive shine, And on that more than regal head Thy gentle, soothing, influence shed? And while on prison-couch he lies, Tracing thy course through midnight skies, Oh! whisper in his wakeful ear With spirit voice soft words of cheer— And say that Liberty divine, Shall call him yet to guard her shrine. THE HARTLEY COLLIERY CATASTROPHE. Dark gulf of death! black cavern of despair! From your foul depths, to breathe the upper air, No victim comes—one common living grave Encloses all—no human aid can save! Not one—not one—to tell the fearful tale How hope expired, and life began to fail; How poisonous gases drank the fainting breath— The scene around one sweltering mass of death— And was there nought but darkness, death, despair, In that low dungeon? Hark! the voice of prayer, The solemn agony of wrestling faith, Passing to life through the dark gates of death, And forms celestial, 'mid the gloom profound, Bright messengers of heaven are hovering round, To waft the ransomed spirits as they rise, On their swift pinions to the upper skies. Broad Britain's heart is moved, its troubled deeps Are full of grief and horror while she weeps Her perished ones—those pale and ghastly sleepers— She spurns the plea—are we our brother's keepers? “Thy brother's blood cries to me from the ground:” An awful truth—stern, solemn, and profound, By Heaven proclaimed—the loss so deep lamented, By obvious means, could—should—have been prevented. Could tender sympathy and generous deeds Bind up each stricken heart that inly bleeds In widowed bosoms—still the orphans' cries— These generous pity prompt, and kind supplies? Ah! these are wounds which only God can heal; The strength He gives shall never faint nor fail; Your orphans' wrongs and yours He will redress— The widows' Judge is He in holiness. REMINISCENCES OF THE “HIE TOON” OF HAMILTON SIXTY YEARS AGO. Fair Hamiltonia! when a happy child I roamed thy charming precincts free and wild. Led by a father's hand, beyond thy bounds I strayed delighted through the beauteous grounds That skirt the Ducal pile, to where thy tide, Brown Avon, mingles with the silver Clyde. There I had been content each day to roam, Till twilight turned my wandering footsteps home. Home of my youth, thy place, thy name is gone! Nought meets the eye but lofty walls of stone; Within no children gambol on the street, No hum of voices—tread of busy feet; The sounds of hammer, axe, and rattling loom, Are heard no more (no Plebeian feet presume To tread where pampered steeds are duly stalled), Nor memories of homes and hearths recalled. Yet there a scene was writ on memory's page, That record neither time, nor change, nor age Effaces:—In a small and lonesome room, Where death and sickness shed a solemn gloom, An aged man lay on the bed of death— Labouring and fitful came his struggling breath— His sunken eyes were dim in death's eclipse: No hand to raise his head, or wet his lips; For in that room, upon a bed of pain, A daughter lay—no being but the twain Was there—she in her weakness vainly strove To rise, and tend the father of her love: At last, on hands and knees, her painful way She crept to where the dying Christian lay— “My father, death is near! your hour is come!” “I know it, daughter—I am going home! My path is light—no darkness clouds my way: Farewell!” he ceased, and calmly slept away, And she, the daughter, trod for many years The vale of life—to her a vale of tears— The vale of death in faith and hope she passed; Her faith grew bright, still brighter to the last. Farewell, my mother! thou art gone to rest, Where sleep in peace the oppressor and oppressed. A Scene witnessed by the Writer in 1799, during the Last Illness of DOUGLAS, EIGHTH DUKE OF HAMILTON. Ah! there are times, and there are places; And there are scenes, and there are faces That Memory ever more embraces, And on her tablets deeply traces. 'Twas summer-tide—the rose was blushing, The songs of birds and streams were gushing, Young zeyphr's wing the leaves was brushing, That slept beneath its slumb'rous hushing. Came through the “toon” a pageant fair, Tall flowers, wreathed figures, quaint and rare, Rich music thrilling through the air, And streaming banners—all were there. I saw the broad-leaved gates expand, With circling sweep—that goodly band, Before the gorgeous portals stand Of that fair palace, huge and grand. Why all this proud and bright display Of music, flowers, and banners gay? We honour thus his natal day, Whose life now passes fast away. Lo! at the open sash appears A form bowed down—but not with years— Hushed be the music, stilled the cheers, So deathly pale his Grace appears. His feeble steps, on either side, A lady and physician guide; He bows;—faint gleams of wonted pride, Like shadows o'er his features glide. I gazed into his open tomb— A low-browed vault of charnel gloom— Where his ancestors' dust had room— No high mausolic Mausoleum, present burying place of the Ducal house of Hamilton. sculptured tomb. REMINISCENCES OF THE “AULD HIE TOON OF HAMILTON,” SIXTY YEARS AGO. A weary traveller on life's thorny way, 'Mid deepening shades of fast declining day, I backward gaze—my dim eyes moist with tears— Through the long vista of departed years: Then Memory unlocks her treasured store, And forms and faces seen on earth no more, In fancy's eye from court and dusky closs Flit o'er the street, and vanish at the cross. Old King's-Head Closs, tradition hath report, That in a house, within thine ancient court, Was Cromwell, while in Scotland, entertained What time he in the ancient burgh remained. Oh, I remember, when a little maid, Outside the “toon” all joyously I strayed, Culling the dandelion's golden flowers— First wayside offerings of young April hours. Through a tall hedge I gazed with mute surprise, For a fair vision flashed upon mine eyes: Her robe was white, with train that swept the ground, Her ivory arms were bare, and smooth, and round, Her powdered ringlets lay like wreathen snow Above her cheek of faintest carmine glow, Long golden pendants trembled in her ears; And yet her blue eyes brimmed with bitter tears— 'Twas Eddelwood's fair heiress Then Mrs Boyce, wife of the Duke's factor.—she who leapt Her chamber window while her maidens slept; And he who caught her in his eager arms, Loved the sweet girl but for her golden charms. Dark disappointment was her bitter lot— She gave—she sought a heart—but found it not. Phantoms of “Eld,” they crowd my inward sight, I see them in the new-born century's light— Old Robin Two old friends of my father's.—who had served in Britain's wars In seventy-six, against the Stripes and Stars— And sailor Will Two old friends of my father's.—a grim sea-wolf—who spun Long yarns of victories by great Nelson won; His tales of blood and battle, tempest wild, Enthralled my ear—a curious earnest child. And you, ye brothers three of Crispin's line, Brothers Paterson, shoe manufacturers. Who kept your state, in days of “auld langsyne,” In corner shop of “Hie Toon's” ancient Cross, Long Hamiltonia felt and mourned your loss. Now crowding phantoms fly—I break the spell— Again with life and living men to dwell. GARIBALDI. Go spread thy strong pinions, and rear thy proud crest, Cleave the red clouds of morn with unwavering breast; Bold eagle! full soon on thy unshrinking eyes, Shall the young sun of Freedom in splendour arise! The vultures of Tyranny shrink from thy glance, And Liberty smiles as she sees thee advance; She hails her brave Nizard, the true bird of Jove, With the bolts of the Thunderer he swoops from above! Ye demons of torture, ye fiends of the cells, Where death-breathing vapours and dark horror dwells, Avaunt! lo, your dungeons are shattered and riven, And their secrets are bared to the pure light of Heaven. The brilliants are dimmed that encircle the crown Of earth's proudest Despot, thou chief of renown, By the bright gleaming lightnings that flash from the brand Thou wield'st in the van of thy conquering band. BRITISH VOLUNTEERS. At the call of the bugle, and the roll of the drum, With the bold front of heroes, our trained Rifles come, All marshalled and marching to strains that inspire, And fan in each bosom the true martial fire. Defenders of Britain—her chosen, her own, Of danger she spake, and to arms you have flown; And bright eyes are beaming, and proud hearts beat high, For the brave Volunteers marching gallantly by. Your movement is crowned with a glorious success, Our good Queen approves, and your country will bless Her brave sons and true in the Volunteer ranks; She gives you the boon of a proud mother's thanks. Let fort after fort darkly frown on the steep— Let steel-plated Warriors keep guard on the deep; Let Armstrong's dread thunders incessantly roar, And his dark tubes of death vomit flame on our shore. Oh, stronger than all, for defence of her coast, Her Volunteer patriots—her glory and boast; No foot of invader her soil shall profane, True hearts and true rifles she trusts not in vain. THE FIRST AND SECOND ADVENTS OF GARIBALDI—1851–2. Ye blest celestial twain, From your bright spheres descending, He called ye not in vain, His soul's devotion tending. To liberty and truth, With burning adoration, In manhood as in youth He made full dedication Of soul, of heart, and arm; Low at your twin shrines kneeling, Her strongest, holiest charm Each gave—his mission sealing. No pomp, no pride of war, No herald-blazoned banner, No trumpet from afar Proclaimed his march—in manner A simple, earnest man, His deeds in toil and danger, Admiring nations scan; To them earth holds no stranger; We count his trophies o'er, High chieftain—lion-hearted, His name shall never more From glory's scroll be parted. Not less—we love him more Since, from his rocky dwelling, By lone Caprera's shore, He came, with heart high swelling, To find how changed the scene. The glorious twain ascending To their bright spheres again, Their gaze still downward bending, With love and sorrow fraught, Italia's Liberator In toils of statecraft caught, By Gallia's dark Dictator. One thing thou lackest—say Why wears thy noble spirit The bonds of Rome, whilst aye Thou seek'st to disinherit The Pontiff of his lands? Oh! rend her chains asunder, And cast away her bands. Harmless the Papal thunder, Thy sovereign found it so, Not excommunication His kingdom could o'erthrow, Or check its liberation. The freedom of the mind, The truth of God free spoken, With a free press combined. Then—not till then, is broken The Papacy's strong power, That holds Italia under. Oh God! to see the hour She tears her bonds asunder, And springs to light and life, United, free, victorious, The conqueror in the strife, Her patriot-hero glorious! GARIBALDI A CAPTIVE. Ye minist'ring spirits of grace, That wait on the good and the true, To comfort, support, and solace— Earth fails us—we call upon you; Bright “tears, such as angels may weep,” As ye gaze on the captive, bestow, And lull his worn senses to sleep, With airs that from Paradise flow. Oh! soul of high honour—Oh! heart Strong, chivalrous, truthful, and warm, Diffusing o'er every part Of his being and presence a charm! At the altar of Freedom he stood, And vowed his fair country to save From tyranny, priestcraft, and blood, Or sleep on the bed of the brave. His deeds they are known to the world, And history will blazon his fame; On Liberty's standard unfurled Italia has written his name. Oh! dark be the eye that took aim, And powerless the arm that could wound The patriot;—for ever may shame The recreant's movements surround. Thee captive, as rebel, they hold, And why?—'tis thy Sovereign can tell: Like Esau, his birthright he sold, And the buyer still wants him to sell. O come! when escaped from the thrall, For thou from thy country must part— We wait thee, we welcome, we call— We offer thee home and the heart. Then come with the child of thy heart— Menotti, the brave, the beloved; Such a sire from a son must not part, Who with blood his devotion has proved. As martyrs, your wounds we embalm, And pray that from pitying Heaven, A soothing, a heart-healing balm, To your suffering spirits be given. CALDER—A MEMORY. Sweet Calder! on thy flowery marge When life was young I roamed at large, With heart that owned no care, no charge, Save for my tiny flower-fraught barge Launch'd on the dancing stream. On thy green banks I loved to lie When high the sun and blue the sky— Thy silver waters gushing by— Watching the trout and minnow fry O'er pearly pebbles gleam. By fair Rosehall, through greenwood glades, Thou glid'st through rose and hawthorn shades, By hyacinth banks, where Monkland's maids Unbind their dark or golden braids And lave their snowy feet. Oh! many a lone and lovely scene, By Enoch's Hall and holms so green, Within thy winding course is seen, Where, rippling 'neath thy woodland screen, Thy murmuring voice I greet. Here would I dwell in rustic cot, Where primrose tuft and cowslip knot, Fox-glove, and sweet forget-me-not, So richly gem the sylvan spot, And sweetest fragrance shed. Again beneath thy bordering trees I walk, and breathe the scented breeze, 'Mid song of birds and hum of bees, And still the scene each sense can please, Though youth and joy have fled. MAY. Blooming, brooding, balmy May, Tell me what to sing or say To thy praise. I muse in vain— Sonnet, song, and rhyming strain Babble still of meadows green, Sprent with dewy diamonds' sheen; Woods bedight in fresh array Of dancing leaves and flowery spray; Warbling birds and humming bees; Murmuring streams and whispering breeze; Cuckoo calling to his love; Wailing voice of forest dove; Lambs at play on field and lawn; Gorgeous sunset, glorious dawn; Loving youths and lovely maids Wandering in the woodland glades; Children crowned with wilding flowers Roam through scented hawthorn bowers; Apple blossoms rich, that speak Of rival tints on beauty's cheek; Singing gaily o'er the dale, Milkmaid trips with frothing pail, Promise fair of curds and cream For sweet May morn, the townsman's dream. Now, what more to sing or say Know I not, thou charming May, To thy praise—ideas fail— Songs of May are trite and stale, Charming neither heart nor ear, Mount we to a higher sphere. Source of all that's fair and good— Ah! so little understood— Oft “with brute, unconscious gaze,” Man thy fairest works surveys, Wanders through the summer bowers— Hears the music, culls the flowers— Basks in sunshine warm and bright— Charms his ear and feasts his sight With each sweet and beauteous thing— Shall he then refuse to bring Tribute to the Name above, The God of nature, light, and love? COUSIN BELL. AN INCIDENT IN REAL LIFE. A dark fir-wud hings ower the burn, That wannerin' jinks roun' monny a turn, Far doon oot through the lanely dell, By whilk ance leev't my Cousin Bell. A strappin', gracefu', blithesome queen, Wi' coal-black hair an' glancin' een; Nae muirlan' lass mair trig an' snell— An' jist nineteen was Cousin Bell. Her faither rentit a bit mailin', It wadna pay—his health was failin'; He had nae dochter but hersel', But brithers seven had Cousin Bell. “Callants,” quo' he, “nae mair we'll toil For nocht; we'll seek anither soil; Yon joiner lad, ye've a' heard tell, Will wed an' keep at hame oor Bell.” For Canada they made them boune— A house was ta'en in the neist toon, Whar wi' her young guidman to dwell, Weel ettle't she—oor Cousin Bell. Ae Sabbath sittin in the kirk, Her heart grew caul', her een grew mirk; Ye couldna guess what there befell Tae blast the luve, the life o' Bell. Purpose o' marriage was proclaimed 'Tween her betroth'd an' ane they named— Intae her faither's arms she fell, “Oh, tak' me wi' ye!” murmur'd Bell. On board they laid her in her berth, For she was dune wi' a' on yirth; They thocht the waves wad ring her knell, An' hide the pale, sweet face o' Bell. Her weary head she seldom shiftit; Her mournfu' een she seldom liftit— Oh! wae betide the traitor fell That brak the heart o' Cousin Bell. She kiss't them a'—her mither's cheek She langest presst—but didna speak; But time an' change can ne'er expel Their love an' grief for Sister Bell. She leev't tae see the promist lan'— The icy waves that lash the stran' Of great St Lawrence rung her knell— Rest, rest in peace, dear Cousin Bell. On far Iowa's prairie lan', Four yet survive o' that fair ban'; An' aften mournfu' memories swell The brithers' hearts for Sister Bell! CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA—EXPOSTULATION. No darker record on the roll of time Was e'er inscribed to country, age, or clime, By the red hand of war—so barbarous, frantic; The war you wage—mad cousins transatlantic. Your glorious land of men and gold you drain— And seas of blood and festering hills of slain. Bankrupt and beggar'd: in your every state These are your gains, you'll sum them up too late. Sons of the Union—ah! a mighty change Your words and deeds have wrought—beyond the range Of British sympathy your cause you place; We almost blush to own your kindred race. Your freedom's dead. Her last expiring groan Comes o'er the waters wild; a shudd'ring moan Wails through your forests, echoes round your hills, We hear, and Britain's heart with horror thrills. Yes, freedom of the press! the tongue, the mind, Henceforth ye must be deaf, and dumb, and blind: Lincoln and Seward wills it. Kiss your chains, And sing of conquest in triumphant strains. And “Stowe,” thou gifted daughter of the North, Friend of the Southern slave, we call thee forth: Let truth and candour guide thy graphic pen; Denounce white slavery in the Northern men. Columbian dames! do ye sustain your part? The weeping, blushing blood of woman's heart, Say—does it pulse your veins and dye with shame Your blushing cheeks at Butler's branded name? Of braggart speech that spurns at check or rule, Like “idiot's tale of sound and fury full;” You feed on lies that fail you at your need, Nor heaven nor earth will bid your cause God-speed. WELCOME TO OCTOBER. Welcome, October! let my simple song Soft echoing, steal thy yellow groves along, Where Nature, conscious of her faded charms, Dejected, sinks into thy languid arms, And mournful throws her tarnish'd robes aside— The faded relics of her summer pride. Yet thou hast charms for me; even beauteous Spring, Crown'd with dew'd flowerets, left untouch'd the string That vibrates softly solemn through my soul, Whose every feeling owns thy calm control. The Summer brook, alive with minnowy fry, And children's plashing feet, with floral dye Of white, pink, purple, blue—all beauteous marg'd, Now brown and chill, the deepening current charg'd With whirling eddying leaves, flows swifter on, And mourns her naked banks with hoarser tone. And ye, whose waning years tell life is brief, When “fallen into the sere and yellow leaf,” Whose life's spring-flowers are wither'd all and dead, Strewn on the winds, or crush'd beneath the tread Of careless feet, yet trampled, yield a balm Sweet to the soul, may ye, serenely calm, Smile o'er earth's fallen hopes, and raise your eyes To the mild glories of the loving skies. THE SEVEN STARS: A CONSTELLATION OF SCOTTISH POETS. BEATTIE. Sweet minstrel! from thy hermit's cell Rich strains of sacred truth are flowing, The haughty sceptic's pride to quell; Thy harp is tuned to numbers glowing. BLAIR. Bard of the grave; o'er death's domain Thy awful muse for ever hovers, Chaunting in sad and solemn strain Each ghastly scene she there discovers. CAMPBELL. Poet of hope, of love, and woe, Of thought refined, and tender feeling, Thy notes of love—sad, sweet, and low, Swell high when Poland's wrongs revealing. CUNNINGHAME. O weird and wild in legend old, In dark tradition! dim and hoary— Thy witching muse doth revel hold In magic, song, and haunted story. BURNS. True child of nature, heir of fame, On thy true heart the muse's altar Burned high—the poet's, patriot's flame, A fire unknown to fail or falter. HOGG. On Ettrick's banks, her Doric lays The shepherd's Muse sat sweetly singing, Till Scotia's raptured meed of praise O'er all her hills and glens was ringing. SCOTT. He sung of feudal halls and towers, Of knights and chiefs, in olden story; Of beauteous dames in tapestried bowers; High chivalry and deeds of glory. The heaven of song is studded o'er With puny twinklers, faintly gleaming; But these shall shine for evermore, Bright in their native radiance beaming. TO TEACHERS OF THE YOUNG. Husbandman, for work prepare Tender plants of promise fair; Rise! around thee everywhere Life's young spring-time claims thy care, Willing heart, and hand. Dig, manure, and prune, and train— Suns, and dew, and vernal rain, Seek from Heaven, nor seek in vain— Flowers and fruits reward thy pain— Fair the smiling land. Break thou up the fallow ground, With the will the way is found; Faint not!—thorns and weeds abound— Seeds of knowledge scatter round— God shall give increase. Father! God! we ask for bread, Stones thou wilt not give instead— Down thy promised Spirit shed— Toil is vain, and hope is dead, Till Thou quicken these. We have seen—we daily see, Plant of hope, some fair young tree, In the soft winds waving free, Green and full of sap is he— Rich the promised bloom. Look again! A hot simoom, Scorches tree, and branch, and bloom— Write in blood the drunkard's doom, Quenched in misery, guilt, and gloom, Finds an early tomb. ON THE MEETING OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION IN GLASGOW, SEPTEMBER, 1860. Queen of the West! we hail thee from afar! The brilliance of each “bright particular star,” That gilds thy halls with intellectual light, A radiance sheds around thee, solemn, bright. The learn'd, the wise, thy classic portals throng: Momentous themes dwell on each gifted tongue. The great, the good, their powers of heart and mind Bring, to improve, to raise, to bless mankind. Ay, we have seen, with moistened eye the while, By men of rank, with warm heart, beaming smile, The hand of fellowship and friendship given To labour's sons. We thank thee, God of heaven, Who hold'st the hearts of all men in thy hand, And turnest them as Thou wilt. The holy band Of Brotherhood more closely we will bind, And, hand in hand, explore the world of mind. Nor this alone; with powers united strive, From charnel-houses of the dead alive, To draw the sunken, vile, corrupted mass, To teach, raise, save the underlying class. Where art thou, woman? art thou at thy post? We cannot want thy aid to save the lost, The youthful dwellers of thy home and hearth, To lead to heaven, and train for life on earth. A REAL INCIDENT OF THE PERSECUTING TIMES IN SCOTLAND. THE SCENE—A LONELY LOW THATCHED COTTAGE NEAR AIRDRIE BURN, NEW MONKLAND. She lay within that lonely cot, And seemed by all, save God, forgot, And one who, when the shadows fell, With stealthy step came up the dell To minister, to soothe, and tend Her dying hours. She was the friend— Still dearest, nearest to her side— As child, as maid, as blooming bride. Their matron cares they shared together, Together sat upon the heather, To hear the words of truth and life, Each a beloved and loving wife. When Scotland's Covenanted men, On moor, and hill, in cave, and glen, For Christ and conscience stood to arms; When mansions, cottages, and farms Were scenes of terror, spoil, and wrong, And not a dog dared move his tongue, She entered, saw through gathering tears The fast fulfilling of her fears; The cold, grey shadow on her face That could not quench the light of grace. “Welcome,” she said, with failing breath, “My friend in life, my friend in death. My hands are chill, my eyes are dim, Take thou my last farewell to him Who now has long in hiding been, And dares not near his home be seen. Tell him on earth we never more Shall meet; yet he to Canaan's shore, To which I haste, shall shortly come And dwell with me in ‘heaven our home.’ Say that I pray with parting breath That he be faithful to the death, When God to him a crown of life Will give: so prays his dying wife. And now, though all of earth recedes From mind and eye, to help the needs Of him I leave in want behind, Say that beneath the hearth he'll find A treasure small when he shall come By stealth to his deserted home.” She ceased. Her friend stooped o'er the bed, Her lips were cold, her spirit fled. She sought no help, she made no moan, She laid her out, and watched alone Till daybreak, then she closed the door And sped her o'er the lonely moor To where, in shelter of the wood, His hiding-place, the husband stood. She told his loss. He bowed his head, “The will of God be done,” he said. “His mercy called my dear one home To shelter her from woes to come.” She told him he must not come near To 'tend the funeral—there was fear; For spies were placed, and watch was set, Assured the rebel they would get. “Beside the bier, if God me spare,” He solemn said, “I will be there. Yes; I will see my dearest, best, Laid in the sheltering grave to rest. Be calm, my friend, fear not the foe, My presence there they shall not know.” By night he watchfully approached The churchyard path, and lowly crouched Behind the hedge amongst the heather, Saw friends and foes pass on together Beside the bier. The burial rite Was o'er, he watched the live-long night Beside the grave—ere break of day He rose, and Scotland left for aye. TO MRS J. CLELAND, ON THE DEATH OF A BELOVED SON AND ONLY CHILD. My olive plant, so green and fair; My budding hope, my dearest care; My only one! He only knew Who gave—and, ah! how soon withdrew The precious gift—how dear I loved My plant on earth; and though removed To higher climes and brighter skies, With mournful tread and weeping eyes I wander round his early tomb— But light from heaven dispels the gloom! An angel voice falls on my ear, “Whom seek'st thou, weeping mother, here? He is not here: thy son hath risen— 'Tis but his shattered, mortal prison Lies there. Oh! would'st thou ever dwell With him thou loved on earth so well? Then Jesus seek, the Saviour know; He'll pardon, peace, and heaven bestow, Where thy loved plant shall bloom for ever, And thou wilt join him ne'er to sever.” ON SEEING A THOUSAND SABBATH SCHOOL CHILDREN WALK IN PROCESSION TO VISIT THE GARDEN AND PLEASURE GROUNDS OF DRUMPELLER HOUSE. What went ye out to see? A Queen gone joyous forth Awhile to wander free On mountains of the north, While loyal thousands press and strain Around her car, a glimpse to gain? One greater far than she This day has gone abroad With thousand children; see Them marshalled on the road— To such was Jesus' blessing given; Of such the kingdom is of heaven. What went ye out to see? A huge transparent dome, Where marvels all that be Found short but glorious home? First Great Exhibition. These childish forms hold gems more bright Than jewell'd Spain or Mount of Light. Koh-i-noor. When Summer crown'd the hours, Proud City of the West, In rarest fruits and flowers Thy princely squares were dressed— But from these human plants shall rise Flowers that shall bloom in Paradise. What went ye out to see? A corpseLate Duke of Hamilton. not laid to rest (As all earth's sons should be) In her maternal breast, But cered in darkly symboll'd tomb Drawn from old Egypt's mythic gloom? No heathen symbol here We seek in vain to prove; Your symbol, children dear, Be still the Lamb, the Dove. Oh, may the Lamb your sins atone, The Holy Dove seal you His own! What went ye out to see? A Christian teacher band, Whose labours—loving, free— Our grateful thanks demand; And ye, God's shepherds, set to feed His lambs, may ye be blest indeed! And, Lady, young and fair, To whom is given the grace To make the young thy care, And aged want solace— May'st thou life's choicest blessings prove, And reap thy full reward above! LINES ADDRESSED TO MRS BUCHANAN OF DRUMPELLER, ON HER KIND RECEPTION OF A LARGE PARTY OF SABBATH SCHOOL CHILDREN. Oh! gentle Lady, with the bounteous hand And feeling heart, receive this youthful band With all thy wonted goodness; dear they'll prize The loving language of thy smiling eyes. The heart of children feels, ah, none so well! The charm of kindness, and the gracious spell Of sympathy with all their little wants, Young hopes and joys with which each bosom pants; And whilst thou walked along the lengthened line Of childish forms, the spirit sure was thine— While sweet emotions thrilled thy gentle breast— Of Him who called unto His side and blest Young children, saying, “Unto such was given Place in the kingdom of His Father's heaven.” Forgive me, Lady! for my heart beat high, Tears sweet, yet solemn, dimmed my gazing eye, As poured the living stream along the way. Oh, loving Saviour! bless these, too, I pray; And bless the Lady by whose pious care The young in Education's blessings share; For this, shall many rise and call thee blest Long after thou art laid in hallowed rest. ADDRESS TO MR JOHN FAIRLIE. Recited at a Jubilee Supper given on the completion of his Fiftieth Year as Parish Schoolmaster in the Parish of Fenwick, Ayrshire. Calling a world to arms—I hear from far The pealing clangours of the trump of war; The horizon political flames forth Her angry lightnings from the lurid North; Old ocean groans, and earth resounds beneath The warriors' tread—the freighted stores of death; While weeping Peace, her features marr'd and blench'd, Her olive trampled, and her white robe drenched With blood and tears, insulted, baffled, yields To demon War—red king of bloody fields. From scenes, from sounds like these, I turn with joy, My friend, to hail thee, blest in thine employ; Approved thy labours—through thy long career, With jubilee honours crowned thy fiftieth year Of faithful teaching, zealous, patient care To rear the tender thought to stature fair; Strong manhood, joyful youth, fair children claim A grateful interest in thy honoured name. Thy children, where are they?—they come! they come! To light with filial love their childhood's home, And with their gracious presence shed o'er all The scene a charm, and gild the festive hall With beaming smiles; their looks of reverend love To thee, thou honour'd sire, sweet welcome prove. Though not with toast, and speech in phrases meet, This night, my friend, may I thy presence greet, Nor join to celebrate with pupils, friends, This happy day—not mine their wish transcends The grateful meed of well-earned praise to pour, With honours due, in this auspicious hour. Friend of thy country's fathers' church, and mine, Firm in her sacred cause, through storm and shine, Guard well her rights; invoke the God of might, Though enemies roar, let God defend the right: He'll purge and purify His church, and there He'll make us joyful in His house of prayer. My friend, farewell! calm be the hour, and bright, When on thy spirit's eye the shores of light, Dress'd in celestial radiance, gently swell, In hope to meet thee there. Again, farewell! LINES ADDRESSED TO M. FAIRLIE, Esq., VIEWFIELD HOUSE, ON RECEIVING HIS PHOTOGRAPHIC PORTRAIT. My valued friend, long tried and true, Thanks warm, sincere, I render you, And haste to say with high regard I viewed your photographic card. Your form and features pleased to scan, God's noblest work, an honest man. To calls of business prompt and ready, In principle and practice steady; Of honour bright, unstained, unsullied, Calm, civil, yet must not be bullied; No pleasure-seeker, given to roam, And why? you answer, “Home, sweet home.” A gentle, graceful, loving wife, A babe the angel of my life, And duteous children growing up To prop my life and wreathe my cup With flowers and fruits of filial love. May peace on earth, a home above, Be theirs—the mimic form to trace No more, but seeing face to face All these to whom such bliss is given: They take no photographs in heaven. LINES INSCRIBED TO MRS M. FAIRLIE OF VIEWFIELD HOUSE. When hands are united, and hearts are entwined, And the bond of affection endorsed by the mind; When the heart's warm devotion our reason approves, And respect ever dwells with the graces and loves; Then home is a temple where peace is enshrined, And the hearth is her altar, where nothing unkind Is offered. The priestess is mother and wife: Her offerings the fruits of her love and her life. Such a home I have seen; it is thine. May it prove For ever the temple of virtue and love! May the flame on the altar, unwavering and clear, The hearth cheer and brighten through many a year! ADDRESS TO THE REV. DR. GARDNER OF BOTHWELL, ON COMPLETING THE FIFTIETH YEAR OF HIS MINISTRY. Pastor revered, beloved! the Muse would fain Join on fair “Bothwell banks” the jubilant strain Raised by thy grateful people; fifty years Look down upon thy labours sown in tears— The precious seed beneath thy watchful care Hath sprung, bloom'd, ripen'd into harvests fair. Returning with thy sheaves, rejoicing, thou Uplift'st to heaven thy venerable brow; For there thy treasure, there thy heart, and there Thy treasures reap'd on earth are garner'd, where They wait to join thee, ripe and full of days, In heaven's eternal jubilee of praise. A stranger I, forgive this simple lay, I wish'd to greet thee—wish'd to hail the day, O aged shepherd, when thy flock approve, With honours meet and tokens of their love, Thy ministrations. May the call come late For thee, a chosen guest, to take thy seat At marriage-supper of the Lamb, and swell The choir of heaven with harp and song! Farewell! LINES ADDRESSED TO THE REV. DR. JOHN MUIR, OF ST. JAMES' PARISH, GLASGOW On the occasion of the Jubilee held to celebrate the completion of the Fiftieth Year of his Ministry. Servant of God! through fifty honoured years, With fears and hopes, with prayerful cries and tears, With watchful care and ever-active zeal, With loving skill that wounded but to heal, Thou led'st the flock committed to thy care By waters still, and pastures green and fair; Kept watch and ward, when danger was abroad, Upon thy towers. Church of the living God! Pillar and ground of truth! what time the cry, “Raze, raze her quite,” went forth; when floods rose high; When schism foaming forth reproach, and hate Beat on her walls and thundered at the gate— Thou, with thy brother veterans, stemmed the tide, For God, in midst of her, was on our side. Even now, when thousand voices join to sing The hymn of jubilee, a jarring string Mars the grand symphony—a hostile tone Of vengeful meaning, to our ears has gone. But God our refuge is, and strength, our aid— Though waters roar we will not be afraid. We greet thee well, we hail thee on thy road, Advanced far heaven-ward; Oh! may Israel's God Remember and accept thine offerings still; Grant thy heart's wish, thy counsels all fulfil! Still may He hear thee from His holy heaven, With saving strength by His own right hand given. Our fathers' temple, guard! her thou hast set Above thy chiefest joy; thine eyes shall yet, Ere God shall call thee to Himself from hence, On all her glory see a sure defence— So prays a friend; forgive, and grant the claim; Our God, our faith, our hope, our church, the same! LINES ADDRESSED TO Rev. D?G?, B.A. My friend, late found, yet not the less approved, Thy zealous labours in the work beloved Of earnest teaching—'midst thy toils and pains A power Divine inspires thee and sustains. With thy credentials from the court of Heaven, As Christ's ambassador, to thee was given, The untrammel'd mind that will not stoop or palter Within the sacred precincts of the altar; Or heap with sordid flatteries the shrine Of Mammon at the cost of truth Divine; Reproving and exhorting with authority, Though still preferment leaves thee a minority. In logical deductions apt and clear; On chosen themes illustrative and near; Powerful in argument, sound in the faith; Thy motto, guide, and rule, thus Scripture saith, “Who winneth souls is wise.” To this blest end May all thy wishes and thy labours tend; And when thy hearers ask for living bread, Thou wilt not, dost not, give them stones instead. For this for thee thy friend shall ever pray, Respectfully and truly thine for aye. LINES ADDRESSED TO THE REV. J. JAMES On his going out as a Missionary to Canada in March, 1857. Zion's King hath called thee—go! 'Tis His sovereign pleasure, Honour on thee to bestow, And charge of gospel treasure. He who winneth souls is wise; High thy glorious calling! Leading pilgrims to the skies— Fear nor toil appalling. Leave thy home by Clyde's fair strand, O'er the Atlantic billow Seek in far Canadian land Stranger's home and pillow. Spread the knowledge of the cross, Tell redemption's story; Counting all things else but loss For the crown of glory. Deem not thou canst leave behind Drink—that dragon cruel; Thou the burning fiend wilt find 'Midst abundant fuel. Then, as now, the demon face— Thine is strength and daring; Give the monster ceaseless chase, Strike with hand unsparing. Dear the fruitful vine that clings To thy faithful bosom; Dear the olive plants she brings Round thy board to blossom; Dear the sacred filial tie, Love and duty blending; Dear the clasp, the tear, the sigh— Warm farewells attending. But a dearer, holier love, Ever heavenward turning, Makes thy heart's strong pulses move, Sets thy spirit burning. “Love of Christ, and love of souls,” Be thy motto ever; Then between, though ocean rolls, Homes, not hearts, we sever! VERSES WRITTEN ON THE OCCASION OF THE MARRIAGE OF ALBERT EDWARD, PRINCE OF WALES, AND ALEXANDRA, PRINCESS OF DENMARK. I would sing a song of gladness, Nuptial bliss and holy love; But the trembling chords of sadness Thrill my bosom as they move. Beauty, royalty, and splendour, Pomp in all its phases seen, We admire; but turn with tender, Deeper, feeling to our Queen. Royal Bride—young, loving, beauteous, Princely Bridegroom, take her hand; Kneel as children dear and duteous To the Lady of the land. So before her mother knelt she, With her Albert by her side, She has felt all thoughts that melt thee— England's, Albert's happy Bride. Mingled tears of love and pleasure, Grief and joy, her cheek bedew; She has lost her life's best treasure, May it be restored in you! Blessed change! no more bombarding Of old Denmark's forts and towers; Love and peace her Princess guarding, Waft her to this land of ours. Happy pair! high crowned with blessing, Be it bliss without alloy! Good Victoria's love possessing, While the nation sings for joy. Prince, thy father, good and gracious, Bright example left behind Holds thy empire—nought so precious— Bind it on thy heart and mind. Princess, in thy queenly mother, Find the pattern of thy life. Loved and loving, bless each other, Britain's daughter, Albert's wife. CRAIGNETHAN CASTLE. A MEMORY. The cloud of years is upward rolled From memory's page, and I behold, Craignethan Or Draffan. gray, thy ivied walls, Thy dusky vaults and roofless halls, The low-browed arch where clotted slime Of blood red hue, the spawn of time, The opening clogs, and no one knows To what it leads, or where it goes,— The window See Scott's Tillietudelm, said to be Craignethan. highand hard to win I see, where Cudie, peeping in, Saw Jenny, wild with terror's throes, Dash in his face the scalding brose. 'Twas on an eve in lovely May, The radiant ruler of the day Went calmly down the western skies That flamed with gold and purple dyes; I slowly climbed the ruined stair And gained the summit,—scene so fair, So rich, romantic, never met My 'raptured eye—I see it yet. Sick with perfume I bowed my head, The castle's hoary front was spread With sheets of blossomed wall-flower, swung Like censors, whence dame Nature flung Her sweetest incense on the breeze That wooed with scented breath the trees. I gazed far down the craggy steep Where Nethan's winding waters sweep So far below, her murmurs seem The spirit voices in a dream. The crumbling roof was greenly crowned With brier and hazel twining round; I broke a tasseled hazel spray To wear as trophy of the day. No drawbridge o'er the moat is seen, Now dry and lined with verdure green, Where apple blossoms, snowy pear, Their petals shed; with lance and spear Mailed warriors rode, with helmets doffed, To Beauty's smiles and glances soft. 'Tis said, when hapless Mary Mary Queen of Scots. fled From Leven's halls, her royal head She laid within the tapestried bower Of Fairly Fair; See Old Ballad of Hardiknute. that fairest flower, Reft from her home, Lord Draffan bore To Nethan's keep. Ah! long and sore She mourned the bloody, vengeful day That saw her sire her husband slay; And she in prayer and tears to dwell For aye in lonely convent cell. Now slowly falls the misty cloud O'er Memory's page, as in a shroud Old memories lie till word or strain Awakes them, and they live again. Sacred Poetry ICHABOD. 1 Sam. iv. 12-22. A panting messenger of woe and dread, His garments torn, and dust upon his head, His wounded feet with blood and travel stained, From Israel's camp hath Shiloh's city gained. With throbbing, bursting heart, and blood-shot eye; With reeling step, and clench'd hands tossed on high; With sobbing, gasping breath, he told his tale— When loud to heaven arose the shrieking wail Of thousand voices; anguish, and despair, And sense of God-bereavement mingled there! An aged priest sits watching by the road, His sad heart trembling for the ark of God— He starts! he calls!—for on his listening ear Rise sounds and cries of more than mortal fear; His eyes are dim, and on his reverend head Well nigh a century's hoary snows are shed. He comes in haste, that messenger of fear— “My awful tidings, priest and father, hear! From Israel's army I have fled to-day—” “What is there done, my son? speak quickly, say?” He trembling said, with voice of faltering dread. “Before the foe hath Israel's armies fled— Great was the slaughter there. How shall I tell Thee, weeping sire, thy priestly children fell? By heathen hands they died, and woe! Oh woe! The ark of God is taken.” Fatal blow! It smote upon his heart; he backward fell. 'Twas not the death of sons he loved too well, Nor kindred's blood, nor Israel's thousands slain: “The ark of God is taken,” scorched his brain— That flash electric. Thus the judge and priest Of Israel died, nor yet the tidings ceased Their work of doom. Thou daughter, mother, wife, Who in thy bosom bore a two-fold life, In nature's hour of anguish most extreme, Thou bow'dst thy fainting head; such tidings seem Too monstrous for belief. The failing tide Of life is fast receding; to her side The weeping females press, and “Fear not thou; A son is born.” The shadow on her brow, The seal of death grew darker, answer none, Nor token of regard she gave. Her son, In dying accents, she Ichabod named. This tribute Israel's parted glories claimed. Even in that hour, bereft of mortal stay, Her husband, father, given to death a prey, A mightier woe which mocked at human grief— A woe to which even God denied relief, Hath cleft her heart, and this the cureless woe, “The ark of God is taken.” Let me go To God himself; I would not longer stay; I'll seek him in the heaven of heavens. Away Her soaring spirit mounts the heavenward road; She lost the ark, but found the living God. THE DEATH OF STEPHEN. Acts vi. 7. O power invincible of faith and love, Like angel rising to his home above, Thy heaven-lit features beam, calm, earnest grace, Firm truth, and holy zeal illume thy face! 'Neath your stern gaze he quails not, men of doom; From Israel's history back he rolls the gloom Of ages, draws in characters of flame Her lineage, bondage, liberty, and shame. Methinks I see thee with thine eyes upturned— Those eyes where all the saint and martyr burned— To Him most high, whose temple is all space, Nor human minds can bound His dwelling-place— To Him who fills by right th' eternal throne, And for His footstool claims the earth alone— Creator, God, by whose all-forming hand All things were made in ocean, air, and land. Thus Stephen spake:— “O ye uncircumcised in ears and heart! Who tread your fathers' footsteps, act their part; A stiff, unbending, blind, rebellious race, Who grieve the Spirit, and resist His grace! Which of the prophets have ye not withstood? Have ye not prison'd, tortur'd, shed their blood, Who showed the coming of that holiest One— Messiah, Jesus, God's eternal Son? Of whom betrayers, murderers ye have been! Oh, bloody race of hands and hearts unclean! From God Himself the law to you was given By hands of angels, ministers from heaven— How have ye kept it? Page inspired proclaim True record of your folly, guilt, and shame!” As lion crouching in the traveller's path Lashes his tawny sides in savage wrath— Watches with glaring eyes his victim near, Then springs with foaming jaws his prey to tear— They gnash their teeth; they rush upon him, wild With vengeful hate—he, heavenward gazing, smiled. Full of the Holy Ghost, to him 'twas given To see unfold the pearly gates of heaven— Behold the glory of the highest One, And see on His right hand th' incarnate Son! With furious cries they stop their ears; they run With one accord upon him. Now begun The work of death; for, lo! they drag, they cast Him forth the city gates; and thick and fast They ply the murderous missiles. Bruised to death, But calling still on God with fainting breath— “Receive my spirit, Jesus, Lord,” he sighed; Then kneeling down, aloud to God he cried— “Lord, lay not to their charge this sin; forgive, Even for His sake who died that they might live.” O words! O scene! might “make ev'n angels weep!” He said, then calm in Jesus fell asleep. But who is he around whose feet are piled The murderers' garments? he hath not defiled His hands with martyr's blood; yet mark his eye, Where flash the fires of genius, even his high And intellectual brow, on which enshrined Sit learning, eloquence, and powerful mind, Give token all this murderous deed received His full consent. He hath not yet believed, Jesus of Nazareth, in thy name; but mad With persecuting zeal, he seeks to add A thousand martyrs, breathing slaughter still; Makes havoc of the Church; the prisons fill; The Christians scatter, who, dispersed abroad, Proclaim in every place the Word of God. But soon, O Saul! from yon refulgent skies A blinding glory shall eclipse thine eyes, And bathe in living light thy new-born soul; And thou shalt run the race and gain the goal Of Christian martyr, preaching first the faith Which once thou persecutedst to the death. Thy name, thy nature, and thy mission changed, Thus, martyr'd Stephen, thus wert thou avenged. LINES ON'THE DEATH OF MY MOTHER. My Mother! O my Mother! when thy spirit heavenward fled, And thy aged form, in death's embrace, lay on thy lonely bed; No hand to raise thy head and wipe the death-drops from thy brow, Or o'er thee breathe a weeping prayer—alone with Death wert thou. Yet not alone! for in thy ear, and on thy glazing eye, Were angel whispers breathed, and dawned the Sun of Glory's sky; And when thy daughter stood and gazed upon thy tranquil face, It seemed to her thy features wore a calm celestial grace. Thy ardent prayers, thy tender cares, thy deep and patient love, How dearly prized—how sorely missed since thou wert called above! For I, a mother, bend beneath a mother's heavy cares, And still I ask of Heaven to reap the fruit of Mother's prayers. When trials crowd, and sorrows press, and fears my bosom chill, My Mother, then I seem to hear thy loving accents still; And still it seems as if to thee my sorrows I must tell— Oh joy, we soon shall meet! till then, my Mother, fare thee well! “GOD IS DEPARTED FROM ME, AND ANSWERETH ME NO MORE.” 1 Samuel xxviii. 8-20. A King has sought at midnight hour The sorceress in her cell, And bids invoke the Prophet's shade, His coming doom to tell. He bows before the spectral form, He speaks in anguish sore— “God is departed from me, And answereth me no more.” Dark words—how pregnant with despair! How fraught with hopeless woe! Stern spake the spirit-seer—“What hope When God He is thy foe? And wherefore seek to know thy doom, For this thou knew'st before? “ ‘God is departed from thee, And answereth thee no more!’ “The word which God hath spoke by me He hath confirmed and done— He rends the kingdom from thy hand; His own anointed one, Even David, he shall fill thy throne; Thy reign, thy life is o'er— ‘God is departed from thee, And answereth thee no more!’ “Since thou obey'dst not God, nor didst His high behest fulfil, He gives thy host, thy sons, thy life, Up to the enemies' will. Thy soul, ere midnight glooms again, Shall wing th' eternal shore. ‘God is departed from thee, And answereth thee no more.’” He faints, he falls, on earth he lies, That stately, peerless form, Which oft had tower'd in Israel's van And ruled in battles' storm. Oh kingly oak! the thunder fires Have scathed thine inmost core. “God is departed from thee, And answereth thee no more.” Who runs may read this awful truth, In lines of lightning traced, The spoken, written Word of God, Though trampled, scorn'd, defaced By men of sin and pride, the earth Shall burn, the heavens decay, Ere Word of God, to man reveal'd, Shall fail or pass away. A FAITHFUL MOTHER'S LOVE. Dear child! a faithful mother's love For thee will toil, and watch, and pray; An angel hovering still above Thy couch by night, thy steps by day. Oh think how oft thy lips have pressed Her breast! how oft thine arms have clung Around her neck, while to her heart She clasped thee close, and sweetly sung! When fever's burning flush suffused Thy cheek, and heaved thy panting chest, Thou rest or refuge all refused Save mother's arms and mother's breast. And she would sit with tangled hair, With haggard cheek and heavy eyes, Tend all thy wants with loving care, And soothe thy pains and hush thy cries. And she would whisper in thy ear, And press upon thy infant mind The name, the love of Jesus dear, And God, thy Father good and kind. The pouting lip, the pert reply, The sullen brow, the stubborn will, Will dim with tears thy mother's eye, And her fond heart with anguish fill. The smiling lip, the ready yes, The sunny brow of cheerful love; What balm for mother's heart like this? What dearer blessing can she prove? Is she a widow? doubly dear Be she to thee; when griefs assail, Kiss thou away each mournful tear That wanders down her cheek so pale. A faithful God, the first, the best— The next a faithful mother's love; Thou shalt, dear child, of these possessed, Be safe on earth, and blest above. Temperance Pieces. NIGHT PHASES OF DRUNKENNESS. PHASE I. The midnight hour hath chimed, The night is wild and cold; I see a trembling hand Yon cottage door unfold. A pale and furrowed face Peers forth into the storm; And o'er the threshold leans A bent and tottering form. Her white hair, damp with tears, Clings to her wasted cheek; With failing eyes she scans The street, her son to seek. His staggering form she sees, His reeling steps she hears— Break, widowed heart! How vain Thy pleading words and tears! PHASE II. A dark, dismantled room— A wailing infant's cry— A little weeping maid Sings mournful lullaby— Two baby brothers, pale With hunger, cold, and fear, Lie at her feet; while she Keeps sobbing, “Mother, dear! “Oh! shall I never see Thy sweet and mournful face? Oh! take thy baby home Unto the blessed place. No milk, no food have I, For her and brothers dear; Father beats us when we cry, And leaves us nightly here.” PHASE III. A workman sought his home, When evening bells had rung— Dark thoughts o'er brow and heart Their sullen shadows flung. A little ragged boy, With hunger in his eyes, Cries, “Mother lies in bed And minds not baby's cries.” No light, nor food, nor fire Is in the wretched room— To where the inebriate lies He rushes in the gloom. He beats the senseless form— He drags her from the bed Where, crushed and livid, lies Her smother'd infant—dead! PHASE IV. A slender, pallid boy, With hectic on his cheek, Moved by his mother's tears, His father goes to seek. The midnight moon looks down Upon the wintry street, And sees the shrinking youth His ruffian parent meet. With drunken fury blazed His eyes—with curse and blow He dashed the feeble boy Upon the stones below. His bleeding form they raised— Sustained his dying head— But ere the mother's arms Had clasped him, life was fled! THE THREE GOLDEN BALLS. Deadlier balls than North or South Throw from cannon's blazing mouth, Everywhere appal my sight— Three in number—golden, bright. “All that glitters is not gold.” “Ah! I could a tale unfold” Of misery, waste, and want, and sin; We pass the balls and enter in. The counter-board seems to my eyes An altar reared for sacrifice. My heart would fail, my tongue would falter, To tell how on this horrid altar Are offered all that life requires To feed the ever-burning fires Of drink, which would, for want of fuel, At times burn out, did not the cruel And greedy priest, who serves the altar, The offerings clutch, and lie, and palter, And cheat the victim of the dole With which he means to drown his soul In hell's hot fountains gushing near— “Spirits and ales,” dark words of fear; And so the groaning shelves are laden With spoils of man, wife, child, and maiden. The priest, who worships only self, Gloats o'er the offerings and the pelf. With heart that mourns, and eye that weeps, I see him store the frowsy heaps With hand of iron, and heart of stone, Brow of brass, and feeling none. Vampire-like, the blood he drains From the drunkard's burning veins. The whisky-shop absorbs his cash, The pawn-shop swallows down the trash Of household gear and wretched clothing. Ah! my soul is sick to loathing Of the sights, and sounds, and crimes, Of these murder-tainted times, When a bath of blood has charms, And power to set a world in arms; And the bather may be bolder If a forty-ticket holder. Here's a man of good connection— Hang him, give him for dissection. What makes your wrath so high to mount? That old man keeps a bank account. Some journals have inspired a furor In many minds 'gainst judge and juror. Would huntsmen cease to lash and growl, “The many-headed monster's howl Would die,” and common sense again Resume the sceptre and the rein. TEMPERANCE WARFARE. “SOUND TO THE ONSET, THE ONSET, THE ONSET!” Arouse ye! arouse ye! the foe is at large, Again and again we must come to the charge. Oh! hotly pursue, and fearless attack— The blood of his victims is red on his track. Our wives are dishonoured, our children are slain By thousands—we labour, but often in vain, For the plundering foe still devours the proceeds, Till nothing is left us but sorrows and needs. We must take his strongholds, put his garrisons down, And pull down his ensigns in village and town; But this is the victory, most glorious of all, Exile him for ever from homestead and hall. Ye matrons and maidens of Britain, to you I would speak, as a sister, most faithful and true To all your best interests. I beg you to hear, By all you hold sacred, by all you hold dear. 'Tis found—Oh, alas! it should ever be so!— That many amongst us are leagued with the foe, Give harbour, and homage, and serve him as slaves, Till bleeding and stumbling they crawl to their graves. And oft with the dear names of mother and wife, Entrusted by Heaven with the mind and the life Of your children, a household, to care for and serve, You pamper the foe while they shiver and starve. Dear sisters, I would, but I cannot, conceal The guilt and the folly you often reveal— Intemperance, and many a fatal neglect, That ever the progress of mankind must check. For who but a mother her dear little girl Will lovingly teach her the ruin and peril Of wanton exposure, the dark deeds of shame, That blot the fair scutcheon of Scotia's fame? The many small fripperies—worthless for use— Your girls delight in, are but an abuse Of time, and a sorry perversion of taste, While the needful and useful are running to waste. Precious the ruby, and pure is the pearl— More precious and pure is an innocent girl; And earth holds no gem of such value and beauty As a Christian mother devoted to duty. ADDRESS AND WELCOME TO J. B. GOUGH On the occasion of his delivering an Oration in Gartsherrie Church. Welcome! Oh, welcome! in thy course of fame— Through rolling clouds of smoke and lurid flame, Belched from a hundred murky piles—at last Thou com'st, and scared Intemperance stands aghast. To charm the adder deaf, we lack the power— Thy potent aid we crave, in this the hour And power of darkness. Wisely thou can'st charm— Unstop the serpent's ear, his sting disarm; Cry, cry aloud, and spare not; lift on high Thy voice of power, till quailing demons fly Their wonted haunts; extinguish thou and quell, With waves of eloquence, the fires of hell— Those fires that scorch the tongue and fire the brain; That feed Death's engines, linked to Ruin's train, Dragging the inebriate, lost, through horrors dire, Till 'neath the grinding wheels the wretch expire! To red Crimea's corse-encumbered dells, Where war with sickness, death, and carnage dwells, All eyes are turned; all ears to hear are strained Of fierce assault, and 'leaguered fortress gained— But higher, holier, stern, though bloodless war, 'Gainst foe more terrible than Russia's Czar, Thou hast proclaimed—God shield thee in the fight!— His forts and towers of strength, raze, raze them quite! Accept the deepest, dearest thanks of those Who, sharing not the sin, yet share the woes And shame incurred by lost degraded ones— Intemperate fathers, mothers, husbands, sons! “Who winneth souls is wise”—in God's own might Go on; thy path shall like the morning light Wax brighter, till the noon of perfect day Shall blind, and scorch, and scare the fiend away! ON SEEING THE BODY OF A WOMAN DRAWN FROM THE MONKLAND CANAL Who had thrown herself into it in a fit of delirium tremens. Drifting before the tempter's power, This piteous wreck in horror's hour On dark perdition's rock was driven! Let groaning earth and righteous heaven Sum up the cost, the fearful price, Intemperance—bloodiest, costliest vice— Thy victims pay! Dread Alcohol! No less than body, substance, soul Thy minions and thy venders crave. So, dripping from the muddy wave They drag—but, ah! too late to save From suicidal drunkard's grave— A bruised and wasted female form, Who perished in the deadly storm Of maddening drink's delirious throes. Bind up her hair; her eyelids close; Her body lay beneath the sod— The soul's award is given by God. Oh, woman, woman! mother! wife! The founts whence gush the streams of life Are thine—why with the accursed thing Thus poison and pollute the spring Of human life? Why bear the name— The drunkard's brand of guilt and shame— The dire conjunction, ah! too common— A mother, wife, and drunken woman! LINES ADDRESSED TO MRS H. B. STOWE On the occasion of her visit to Glasgow, April 13, 1853. Lady, to thee, to fortune, and to fame, I, all unknown, would yet aspiring claim A right to love thee, and admire from far Thy pure and tender light. Benignant star, Bright in Columbian heavens we see thee rise, Herald of freedom's dawn in Southern skies. Far on the dim horizon she appears Struggling through blood, red clouds bedewed with tears, The dews of anguish, wrung from hearts and eyes— Crush'd, blasted, sever'd from all human ties. Dark exhalations rise her form to shroud, And wrathful demons glare from every cloud. In vain shall Slavery's vile Draconian code Of lawless laws, that flout the laws of God— Her blood-hounds, scourges, chains—exclude the day. No; things of darkness, hence! avaunt! away! Day breaks. Aside the murky vapours roll'd, Mid roseate draperies, rich with orient gold, Appears the goddess, shouts the applauding world, The striped and starry flag she holds unfurl'd. From the proud blazonry wipes out the name— The curse of slavery and the brand of shame. Lady, my land breeds not nor barters slaves, But she has ruined homes and drunkards' graves. Here mad Intemperance clanks her Bedlam chain, And plies her scourge of snakes, shame, ruin, pain— The fangs of fell remorse, and fierce despair, Sink in the victim's heart and quiver there. O gifted lady! from mine island strand I gaze far sea-ward, wave the beckoning hand. Thou comest—Oh, welcome guest!—and worthless, I Shall meet thee—not on earth; our goal's the sky. ON THE ANTICIPATED RETURN OF J. B. GOUGH TO BRITAIN. Ere ancient Thebes began on high to raise Her crest of towers; ere rose the wondrous maze Of column'd temples, palaces, and halls, Of pillar'd porticoes, and pondrous walls, Far o'er the waste old Amphion's magic lyre Rung forth wild music to his touch of fire— Then heaved the rocks, and danced the stones along, Moved by the mighty spell of glorious song. High swelled the strain, swift rolled the stony flood, Till Thebes, upreared, in gorgeous beauty stood. No fabled lyrist—Gough, in thee we find Thy tuneful eloquence, thy wealth of mind, Thy words of power, and melody of tone, Can move the will and draw the heart of stone, Can startle, thrill, inspire, and arm the soul With power to abjure for aye the madd'ning bowl. So, from the fearful pit and miry clay, Where cold, insensate inebriates lay, They shake, they move, they come, and tower and wall, Palace and temple, dome and pillared hall, In order rise beneath thy skilful hand, Wise master-builder, moral structures grand, On temperance based, amidst the desert smile, The beauty, strength, and safety of our isle. Again return. Ah! many a change has passed Since from our island shores thou parted last— Ten thousand welcomes wait on thy return. Then come “with thoughts that breathe and words that burn”— Entreat, appeal, and warn—thrill brain and heart; While bosoms heave and tears spontaneous start. The sense, the feeling, and the ear enchain, And earth, yea heaven, shall prove thy words not vain. LINES On reading some of the tirades against Britain in the New York Herald. What's a' the din? is Jonathan gane gyte? What ails the fallow, that he'll growl an' flyte, An' shake his neive across the wide Atlantic, Wi' glunchin' broo, an' mony a senseless antic? Ne'er fash your thoom wi' us, my Yankee billy— Thae blusterin' havers mak' ye unco silly; Tak' tent, my man, ye're needfu' o' a skelpin', For, gudeness kens, ye're never o'er the yelpin'. Steek up your gab, ye wild, camstrarie laddie, Nae mair yaff yaffin' at your British daddie; I think ye micht hae ither tow tae tease, When baith the North and South are in a bleeze. A fleesome sight, atweel, tae a' the warl'— Wi' friens that wish ye weel ye soudna quarrel— For Britain, frae her cozie islan' dwallin', Will naither mak' nor meddle wi' ye, callan. Ye're no that unco steive in limb an' lith; Ye're scrimpit baith in courage, sense, an' pith; Langsyne ye gat yer legs out o'er the harrows, Sin'syne ye think ye hae nae mony marrows. But len' yer lugs, and dinna bounce and bark— Ye needna tear your hair nor rive your sark— If ye'd faced Wellington or brave Lord Clyde, They'd gart ye keep your place an' cou't your pride. Your sangs o' liberty are bosh an' tee-dum; It wad be better baith for you an' freedom If ye had ne'er cut up the auld connection, Nor snool't tae democratic mob direction. Ye'll ne'er hae peace until ye get a king— A coup d' etat for you's the vera thing; There's Nap. the Third, wha whamel't bluidy France, An' hauds her doon—had ane like him the chance, He'd grip the reins, wi' bit an' bridle haud ye, An' should ye rear or kick, he'd whip an' daud ye. An' gif ye maun be sodgers, he will learn ye— But ye'll needs dae his biddin', min' I warn ye; For fock that canna guide nor rule themsel', Should hae a ruler strong, an' stern, an' snell. THE MOURNING MOTHER. What woe is thine, pale mother?—say What grief devours thy heart? For aye Thy looks averted shun the day, And midnight sees thee watch and pray With sighing, quivering breath. The hand of wedded love to clasp— To feel true friendship's fervent grasp Is thine. Why, then, with sob and gasp Still heaves thy heart, as sting of asp Had struck the pang of death? “Oh, lost! lost! lost!—the loved, the young On dark perdition's torrent flung— With maddened brain and hearts unstrung O'er deepest gulf of ruin swung, And I—I cannot save! O! minstrel King, thy soul-wrung cry Draws from my heart a deep reply— My sons, my sons! each burdened sigh My sons, my sons! breathes to the sky— My God, thy help I crave! “My gentle boys—obedient, fond— How oft around my knees ye conned The Book which taught all names beyond His name to bless whose blood atoned For guilt of fallen man! How blessed the time when work and play Alternate shared the hours of day! Till pillowed cheek to cheek ye lay, And mother o'er you stooped to pray, As only mother can.” But, ah! on clouds of grief and shame, To this dear home a demon came— The undying worm, the quenchless flame Are thine, Intemperance; at the name The lesser fiends rejoice. Well hath the dark-souled poet said— “More sad than wail above the dead Are words by living sorrow fed:” Such breathe o'er lost inebriate's head From mourning mother's voice. The song, the dance, the wanton's love, May fail the young desires to move; But fiercer ordeal they must prove, Launched on the world, who rise above The tempter's proffer'd cup. They fell, for guileless youth what hope? Urged, bantered, drawn, nay, forced to cope With senior mates in yard or shop: Workmen, these human offerings stop To Moloch offered up. THE DRUNKARD'S WIFE. O Jeanie, my woman! whar is't ye are gaun, Wi' a bairn on yer arm an' ane in yer haun? There's snaw on the grun, an' nae shoon on yer feet, And ye speak na a word, but jist murther an' greet. Yer ae drogget coat is baith scrimpy an' worn, An' yer aul leloc toush is baith dirty an' torn; An' roun' yer lean haffits, ance sonsy and fair, Hings tautit an' tousie yer bonny broun hair. Yer wee shilpit weanie's a pityfu' prufe That yer bosom's as dry an' as queem as my lufe; For the bairn wi' the beard sooks ye sairest alace, For he draws the red bluid frae yer hert an' yer face. Waesucks for ye, Jeanie! I kent ye fu' weel When a lass; ye war couthie, an' cantie', an' leal: Wi' cheeks like the roses, yer bonnie blue ee, Aye glancin' an' dancin' wi' daffin an' glee. They tauld ye that Davie was keen o' the drink, That siller ne'er baid in his pouches a blink; An' a' he got claut o' he waret on the dram, An' ae pay ne'er sert till anither ane cam. But ye wadna be warnt, sae yer wierd ye maun dree, Tho' aften ye raither wad lie doun an' dee; For o' puir drucken Davie ye've nae houp ava, Sae yer greetin', an' toilin', an' fechtin' awa. LINES Written on seeing the very large Sabbath School Procession of 3d July, 1862,passing by. Were thousand angels, sinless, bright, With folded wings, and robes of light, With flowing locks and glorious eyes, To walk our streets—with what surprise And awe-struck wonder we would gaze, And ask each other in amaze, Why to our sinful earth was given To bear the denizens of heaven! No angel band to-day, I ween, Upon our village street was seen; But thousand spirits, young and fresh, Wrapt in the veil of mortal flesh. That veil on earth the Saviour wore; In heaven He wears it evermore; He took not angel nature on— Your nature, dear ones, yours alone. I gaze on thousand childish forms; The veil they wear is food for worms; If saved from sin, the spirit springs, When drops the veil, on brighter wings, In whiter robes than angel wears, Washed in the Saviour's blood and tears. Dear children, 'twas with moistened eye I saw you pass my window by; I marked your gambols on the grass, And, sighing, said, “Alas! alas! What tongue may tell, what heart can know, The heirs of bliss, the heirs of woe, That mingle in the joyous throng, That wake the woods with dance and song!” To us the gracious words were given, “Of such the kingdom is of heaven.” Yet none who live and die in sin That kingdom e'er shall enter in. Then love your teachers; love your school; Be subject to your parents' rule; Be grateful for the loving care That gave you all these joys to share. Be love's sweet law your rule alone, Like Him who took your nature on. THE HAUNTED HOUSE. The Haunted House in days of yore Stood lone, deserted, ruined, hoar, With dusty panes, and moss-grown sill, With grass-grown steps, rooms dark and chill, Where, while the wailing night winds moaned, Pale shrouded spectres shrieked and groaned; And nightly, winged with wild affright, The trembling youth in rapid flight Would pass the spot, nor look behind, For fearful sounds were on the wind, Nor paused till on the hearth he stood Amidst the dear fraternal brood. The Haunted House!—how vast the change In modern times! A goodly range Of painted casements gaily shine With glittering panes; large crystalline And rich cut goblets brimming high— Where troops of fiends in ambush lie, Prompt to obey that potent charm— The screw-propelling waiter's arm. And, hark! through rooms gay, throng'd, and bright Sound festal strains and laughter light, And tinkling bells and dancing feet Shall trip the time to music sweet. Ah, simple youth! beware, beware! Cross not that threshold snowy fair, With varnished door for ever ope— Within the ghosts of murdered hope Of wedded duties, filial claims, Of high resolves and noble aims, Of health and fame, of time and peace, With wail and plaint that will not cease, For ever, when dark midnight falls, Stalk through the rooms, glide round the walls; While warning voices mournful swell Upon the wind with dirge-like knell: Pass, thoughtless youth! 'twere death to stay, Avoid, turn from it, haste away! ON SEEING THE DEAD BODY OF A MAN Taken out of the Monkland Canal, who had fallen in in a state of intoxication. 'Twas night; I stood on yonder fir-crown'd height And look'd on flaming furnace, forge, and mine; The black-brow'd clouds with lurid fires were bright, That flashed o'er road, canal, and railway line. One hour to midnight—Sabbath morn drew near Mid sights and sounds, “might make even angels weep;” No prayers, save those for liquor, reach'd my ear; No sounds, save oaths profane and curses deep. From chambers rank with vile and stifling fumes, From tables full of vomit, staggering home Comes one who still on past escapes presumes To reach that home where he no more shall come. Down the lone bank, blaspheming as he goes, Along the margin of the sluggish wave That bears the treasures of the mine, and flows An ever-open, frequent, drunkard's grave. Unseen, unheard, the plunge, the drowning strife, The gasping agony, the gurgling cry That o'er the waters rung the knell of life, While echoes of the woods alone reply. Fair dawn'd that April Sabbath morn; the voice Of joyous birds awoke on every bough, The woods, the shining waters, all rejoice— But where? O lost inebriate! where art thou? Lo! where the dancing ripples wave his hair, Erect against the slope his body stands; His wide fixed eyes and death-pale brow are bare, And fill'd with grass and clay his clenched hands. A thousand times his reeling steps had trode The fatal path, and still escaped the doom That sent him unprepared to meet his God, And to a lone, unwept, unhonour'd tomb. THE CONTRAST. See yonder wretched little girl, Braving cold, and want, and peril, Wandering through the frozen street, Seeking her she fears to meet; Matted locks hang round her ears, From her wild eyes rain the tears; In her arms a squalid child, Wrapt in rags all torn and soil'd, Clinging to her shivering breast— Young bird cast from rifled nest. Now the mother's form she sees, Drooping head and tottering knees, Babbling tongue and idiot stare, Ah! too well her state declare. “Mother! mother! father's come; Haste! Oh haste! he waits at home!” Ay! he waits for her returning, Wrath and hate within him burning. Oh! that home, how desolate! Bare the walls, and cold the grate; Empty cupboard, naked bed, Health and peace and comfort fled! Hark, those sounds! your ears they tingle! Blows and shrieks and curses mingle— Words of passion, fierce and wild. Weeping girl and screaming child, While the shades of evening close, Cowering, sobbing, seek repose; Couched on straw, the group, forlorn, Wait the miseries of the morn. God! I pray, with heart high swelling, Mercy on the drunkard's dwelling. See that playful, laughing girl, Lips of rose, and teeth of pearl, Brow unwrinkled by a frown. Waving locks of golden brown, Shading soft her azure eyes, Dimpled cheeks, whose hue outvies Rose-bud wild, I hear her singing— O'er the mead her wild flight winging— Weaving 'neath the willow bushes Coronets of fragrant rushes. Mother at the cottage door— Gazing the fair landscape o'er— Sees on homeward path advancing, Her wee daughter skipping, dancing, Fill'd her lap, and hands, and bosom With flowery blooms and hawthorn blossom. Look within; how clean and neat! The fire is bright, the tea is set; The father lifts his eyes to heaven, And asks on all its bounties given, God's blessing. Now the blooms and roses Are laid aside; the evening closes— The blinds are drawn—fast closed the door— And now, upon the cottage floor, That lovely, lowly group are kneeling In fervent prayer, to Heaven appealing; And while their hymn of praise is swelling, We'll pray, “God bless the temperance dwelling.” THE PLAGUE OF OUR ISLE. It is said, it is sung, it is written, and read, It sounds in the ear, and it swims in the head, It booms in the air, it is borne o'er the sea— “There's a good time coming,” but when shall it be? Shall it be when Intemperance, enthroned on the waves Of a dark sea of ruin, is scooping the graves Of thousands, while redly the dark current rolls With the blood of her victims—the slaughter of souls? A canker is found in the bud, flower, and fruit Of human progression—a worm at the root Of social improvement—a fiery simoom That sweeps o'er the masses to burn and consume. 'Tis found on the heaven-hallow'd day of repose— Blest haven of rest from our toils and our woes!— That voice of the drunkard, the oath, curse, and brawl, Are sounds of such frequence, they cease to appal. We see the grey father, the youth in his prime, Throw soul, sense, and feeling, health, substance, and time, In the cup of the drunkard—the mother and wife Hugs the snake in her bosom that 'venoms her life. We see the gaunt infant, so feeble and pale, Crave nature's sweet fluid from fountains that fail; Or run with hot poison, distill'd from the breast Of the mother—O monstrous!—a drunkard, a pest! We've seen, with her bright hair all clotted with blood, Lie cold on the hearth—where at morning she stood The wife of a summer—a babe on her breast— The husband a drunkard—let death tell the rest. And darker and deeper the horrors that shroud The brain of the drunkard; what dark phantoms crowd “The cells of his fancy,” his couch of despair Is empty—the suicide slumbers not there! O why do we seek, do we hope to bestow “The colours of heaven on the dwellings of woe?” 'Tis temperance must level the strongholds of crime— 'Tis temperance must herald the “coming good time.” Then, turn ye! Oh, turn ye! for why will ye die? Ye shrink from the plague when its advent is nigh— The Indian pestilence, the plague of old Nile— Less deadly by far than the Plague of our Isle!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ESSAYS THE TWO CONQUERORS; OR THE CONQUESTS OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT AND THE MISSION OF PAUL AND SILAS TO MACEDONIA. Acts xvi. 9-40. 'Twas ancient Macedon that gave to time The hero, world-renown'd—his sire sublime Olympian Jove: so said the royal dame Whose breast maternal nursed the child of fame. All-conquering conqueror—too small the world For thine ambition—thrones and sceptres hurled To dust; earth saw her dynasties o'erthrown, That thou might'st reign unrivall'd and alone! Lo, in the van, to fight, command, and lead, Earth's matchless rider on his matchless steed, From Greece to Ind, still victory flies before, Till Alexander reigns from shore to shore! The scene is changed, the victor quits the field, Fierce joys, wild pleasures, all that earth can yield, Are his nude nymphs—his bloody laurels twine With myrtle wreaths. On floods of sparkling wine Sits Death triumphant, plucks the victor's crown From his cold brow, and binds it on his own. Long ages pass—'tis Macedonia still. Not now the trump of war from hill to hill Awakes the echoes of each rock and cave With calls to victory or a warrior's grave. Comes one from Philippi: “What hast thou seen?” “Two lonely men of lowly gait and mien.” 'Tis Paul and Silas; now shall Macedon Receive a conqueror mightier than her own— Behold the Banner of the Cross unfurled, And waved triumphant o'er a conquered world! True soldiers of the cross! how glorious far Your mighty Leader! Glorious far the war He bids you wage, strong in His strength and might! Celestial armour guards you in the fight; For not with flesh, and blood, and things of earth, But powers and spirits of infernal birth Ye wrestle—holding fast the shield of faith To quench the fiery darts of sin and death. Wielded by you, how flashed the Spirit's sword! The searching lightnings of the eternal Word Startled and woke to life a slumbering world, And from their thrones the powers of darkness hurled! O more than conquerors! hark the loud acclaim Earth sends to heaven, and heaven returns the same: “Glory to God on high, good-will to men, Peace, peace on earth, Amen, yea, and Amen!” SCOTIA: A VISION. Midnight's solemn peal had rung; My drowsy spirit listless hung Between the certain and unreal, When visioned forms and shapes ideal Come floating from the dreamy cells Where vagrant fancy ever dwells. And thus, half-conscious, in my ear A wailing voice I seemed to hear; Its tones were thrilling, sad, and wild, Like mother's anguish o'er her child. Methought my casement opened wide, A female form, that seemed to glide On air, within my chamber stood. I knew her by the plaid and snood That bound her streaming, golden hair, With rainbow hues all checker'd fair. Her flowing robe around her fell; Entranced I lay, as if a spell Had bound me. On her mournful face Love, sorrow, majesty, and grace Were blended: she the silence broke; My heart leaped up, 'twas Scotia spoke. “Where shall I hide my world-wide shame?” She cried; “Ye jewels of my fame, My virtuous maidens, fair and bright, Come forth and bless your Scotia's sight— Come dressed in Virtue's spotless charms, To honour, grace, and bless the arms Of wedded love. The wound is deep That pains my heart; I mourn and weep This sad reproach above all others, My nameless babes and unwed mothers. This plague-sore eats away my life; Stand up and answer, mother, wife— Have you by teaching, watching, prayer, By fair example, ceaseless care, Trained up your child that she should go In Virtue's path—say, is it so? Let conscience speak, the roll of time Is black with shame and red with crime.” She paused, my bosom heaved and thrilled. When next she spoke, her eyes were filled With burning tears of grief and shame. “Lost is the prestige of my name; My daughters, modest, pure, and good— What hand shall save from ruin's flood The fair frail barks it soon would whelm? Mothers, good mothers, at the helm!” She ceased, she vanished, and my room Seemed wrapt in sadder, deeper gloom. A TRUE STORY. TO YOUNG ABSTAINERS. Listen, dear ones, to my story, True as sad, and sad as true; 'Tis a tale to make you sorry— Show you what vile drink can do. 'Twas the Sabbath. From my casement Glanced mine eye along the road; Scene I saw of dark debasement— Blush, Oh earth! forgive, Oh God! Came a pair of drunkards hoary, Wife and mother named they one: Husband he—ah! shameful story— Father to that sorrowing son; Who, when long from home they tarried, Sought and found them, helpless set 'Gainst the wall, by turns half carried; Who that saw will e'er forget? While he props the helpless mother, Down the father prostrate falls; Stoop'd to him, his name the other Loud in babbling frenzy calls. Folks from out the doors came peeping; Curious children gathered round; Shame and grief subdued him: weeping, Down he sat upon the ground. Oh those tears! I pray that never May I see the like again; Female lips began to quiver, Children sad and still remain. One steps forth from the beholders— Good Samaritan is he— “Friend,” he said, and touched his shoulder, “Help and pity take from me.” “Thanks!” he said, and raised his mother, All insensate, on his arm; Bore his unknown friend the other, Shelter'd both from shame and harm. Children, are your hearts not burning With a grateful, fervent flame, Ye who ne'er with tears of mourning Watched and wept a parent's shame? A PARODY ON “THE WAYSIDE WELL,” AN EXQUISITE LITTLE POEM IN DICKENS' “HOUSEHOLD WORDS.” WRITTEN FOR “CASSELL'S WORKING-MAN'S FRIEND.” Hail to thee, the Workman's Friend, We wreathe thy brow with roses! While thy useful page we tend, Weary heart reposes. Welcome! flowers all fresh and sweet Cull'st thou for the masses; Life's worn traveller will thee greet, Reading as he passes. Treads thy weekly round the wise; Comes the workman to thee, Free as gent's or lords who rise From gilded page to sue thee. Thou from Labour's sons dost earn Many a heart-felt blessing; And receiv'st from them in turn Welcome and caressing. Fair thy rising fame ascends, Like Latona's daughter, Till the full-orb'd radiance lends Light to land and water. When thou scannest written page, Glancing o'er thy table, Light shall fall thy censure's rage, Soft on wights unable. Matrons love thy household lore; Public seems to pet thee; Critic, with his caustic store, Seeketh not to fret thee. Cool, and free from party strife, Friend of progress steady— O'er thy editorial life Watcheth dame and lady. To thy page the star of love, Maiden fair doth bend her; Mothers' minds thy fancies move— Earnest, true, and tender. Bounteous spirit! thou hast won Just decreed ovation; Thine the page to admit and own Worth in humblest station. Ne'er shall Envy's blighting fog— Stricture made in malice— Nought thy patriot efforts clog— Success brims the chalice! Heaven be in thy inmost ken, Thou that nobly darest To assert that men are men When the garb is barest! LYRICS OF DRINK. “Whatever step I take, and into whatever direction I may strike, the drink-demon starts up before me and blocks my way.”—M. Hill. I turned me to the house of prayer, Nor thought to meet the demon there— But as I musing onward trod, I met him staggering on the road, In semblance of some beastly creatures, With blood-shot eyes and bloated features, Who revel held the live-long night, Till now the Sabbath sun shone bright. I stood beside an open grave; The demon here no power can have. The coffin lowered, the grave filled up, The mourners crave a friendly cup Their griefs to soothe and spirits cheer. Oh! draw the veil and drop the tear O'er scenes on which the demon smiles, When they have fallen by his wiles. I turned me to the police cells— The demon's voice there ever swells Through every passage, cell, and chink, And echo ever answers “Drink!” A corpse is borne in at the door— He died in drink; and on the floor, Dead drunk, some ghastly wretches lie, Unfit to live, but, ah! to die! I turned to where the parish dole Is monthly dealt—too oft the sole Resource of widow'd age and want— Yet on this pittance, stinted, scant, I've known upon this piteous dole The demon levy tax and toll; By him from Want's lean fingers torn, Though shivering, starving, and forlorn! Turn ye to furnace, forge, and mine; Turn to canal and railway line, Where wheels revolve and hammers clink, And, lo! up starts the demon Drink. The joiner's bench, the mason's shed, The place of dough and smoking bread, The tailor's board, the Crispin's stool— All, all proclaim the demon's rule! LYRICS OF DRINK. Pour ye a wail of the wildest E'er wrung from a worn heart and mind! Tears and entreaties the mildest Are blown like the chaff on the wind! Speak through a trumpet of thunder, The drunkard is deaf to the call; Words of deep sorrow and wonder, Unheeded, uncared for, may fall! Woe for the heart-stricken mother, Sinking in terror and shame From scenes that she vainly would smother— The curse of her house and her name! Woe to the grey, stooping father— The blossoms of love and of trust He hoped of his children to gather, Are withered and gone up like dust! Woe for the drunkard—all feelings Of manhood and duty are gone! List to his horrid revealings, When Reason lies drowned on her throne! Horrors, deep, direful, are rushing Through the dark 'wildered cells of his brain; Despair fiercely rending and crushing Each nerve and each hot throbbing vein! Woe to the fiend-haunted dwelling Where the demon of drink hath abode! No Psalm, even or morning, is swelling, But curses of man and of God! His heaven and his hell are in drinking; 'Tis bliss when his raging desires He is glutting; his hell is in thinking, Sublimed in Eternity's fires! TRUST IN GOD. Jeremiah xvii. 5-8. Thus God hath said: Unblessed is he Who makes an arm of flesh his trust; Whose heart departs from God shall see His blossom'd hopes go up like dust. Like heath in desert—scorch'd and bare, 'Neath eastern summer's burning noon— That bears no bud, nor blossom fair, Bestows no sweetly fragrant boon. When clouds drop fatness to the sky, It holds no tiny, purple cup; Though dews upon its branches lie, It drinks no living juices up. A parch'd, a herbless, treeless, wild, A land of salt and rifted stone, Where man hath never dwelt and toiled, There shall he dwell alone, alone. But blest is he—how great his gain!— Who trusts in God! When storms assail Him, everlasting arms sustain— His founts of mercy never fail. Like stately tree, whose branches wave Their wealth of foliage o'er the stream, That spreads its roots where waters lave, Nor fears the fervid solar beam. Its quivering leaves, so darkly green, Shall fan the glowing brow of noon; Or, dropp'd with dewy brillants' sheen, Shall glisten 'neath the cloudless moon. Who trusts in God, no weeping fears, No wasting cares his soul disarm; When killing droughts bring famined years, He trusts in God and smiles at harm. His teeming boughs, with mellow fruit, In rich and ruddy beauty glow; And why? the living, spreading root Is planted where the waters flow. VERSES Suggested by a Concert given in Aid of the “Coatbridge Ladies' Benevolent Society,” 18th November, 1862. Benevolence, attended by beauty, By elegance, fashion, and grace, Makes pleasure, the handmaid of duty, To plead for the poor in this place. She pleads! while rich music is ringing Through halls gay with splendour and light, Where a voice, like a seraph's, is singing Of Scotland, her wrongs and her might. She pleads! while the charm'd ear is listening To eloquent, moving appeals; And the soft eye of Pity is glistening At Misery's sorrowful tales. She points to the couch of the dying, Where squalor and poverty reign; Where the widow is toiling and trying Her fatherless babes to sustain; To age, with its wants and its ailings, Its weakness, and final decay; Lone woman, her faintings and failings, While tracing life's wilderness way. Oh! 'tis where you succour and cherish The aged, the widow, the lone: Their blessing, when ready to perish, Dear ladies, you often have known. Heaven crown all your efforts with favour The poor to assist and relieve; It is found in each generous endeavour “More blessed to give than receive.” AUL' SCOTLAN'. Aul' Scotlan'! lan' o' cakes an' sang, O' gude pease scones an' kebbuck whang, Yer crumpy farls o' ait meal cake, An' barley bannocks, wha wull bake? It's no the wife that curls her nose At cogs o' sowens or cadger's brose, An' uggs at lang-kail, and wud skail In dub or sheugh the water kail. The tea-pat at the ingle lowe Stauns, beekin' syne wi' laif or row, Or bakes an' jam, she gusts her gab. The callans—Geordie, Tam, and Rab— Wi' no ae hair on chin or cheek, Gang puffin' oot tobacco reek; In bed at twal instead o' ten, An' think that swearin' mak's them men. Waesucks, there's nocht but dress an' daffin', An' rinnin' here and there, an' yaffin', Wi' haveral tongue, 'mang lassocks gilpie. The aul' fock, turnin' grey an' shilpie, Fin' oot ower late that want o' trainin' Tae wark, an' wit, the mither hainin' Her dochter, while fu' sair she toils, Is juist the thing that lassocks spoils. The warl's sair altert. In my day, Afore my hair grew thin an' grey, A wife wad thocht it sin and shame If that she brang nae siller hame. The warkman's wage was geyan sma', And sae the wife tuk pirns tae ca', Or wrocht at the tambourin' tent, Tae eke the wage an' help the rent. In hairst she keepit up her rig, An' left the wee bairns wi' the big; An' wi' her fee bocht claes an' shoon, An' keepit aye their heids abune. The bits o' lassocks, blate and douce, Wur learnt tae wurk an' red the hoose; A stripit toush, an' plaidin' coat, Maist feck o' a' the duds they got. A towmond ye micht ta'en tae seek, Nor seen a pipe in callan's cheek, Or heard an aith. They kept the neuk Ilk nicht whan faither tuk the beuk, An' ran at biddin', wrocht their wark, An' gat their schulin' efter dark. There's been an unco grit ado, An' muckle cry an' little woo, Aboot what big fock ca' the masses— Whilk means, ye ken, the wurkin' classes; Tae gie them lear, an' learn the weemin The airts o' cookery an' cleanin'. An' noo, ye Scottish wives an' mithers, This speaks to you abune a' ithers— Ye maun be geyan sair to blame, An' weel I wat I think great shame, That ony man should need tae tell ye Tae clean your hoose, an' tent your belly Wi' weel-made-ready halesume meat, An' tae be carefu' and discreet. A' this is very gude an' needfu', But, Oh! ye should be unco heedfu' Tae airt yer bairns tae a' that's richt, An' frae a' ill tae warn and fricht; An' aye be shure ye gie a sample O' what ye bid in your example. Your wark's afore ye, never swither— Be juist a true, gude Christian mither! THE WAY O' THE WARL'. It's the way o' the Warl' when yer troubles are sair, An' yer doon i' the dirt, aye tae tramp ye the mair; Ye may warssle an' grane, ye may murther an' cry, Wi' a glunch or a sneer she wull gang her wa's by! It's the way o' the Warl' tae think maist o' braid-claith An' the weel-plenisht purse—Oh, hoo weel she likes baith! The thin raggit doublet she canna weel thole, An' she ne'er could pit up wi' a pouch an' a hole! It's the way o' the Warl' aye tae soun' weel the fame— Nae odds hoo he gat it—o' the chiel wi' a name; But the nameless, though giftit, are caul' i' the yird, Ere a sang or a word i' their praise she wull mird! Then maybe she'll say, when he's streekit and caul'— “Puir chiel! I aye thocht him a gude kin' o' saul;” An' syne ower his grave she'll big a wheen stanes, An' sit on the tap o't, an' greet ower his banes! Noo, yer way wi' the Warl's jist tae let her alane, Ne'er fash her wi' yammerin'—ne'er mak' ye a mane— Ne'er haud up yersel' an' yer sairs tae her een— She's ower thrang wi' hersel', an' she cares na a preen! Juist help ye yersel', an' there's Ane that wull help: Whan the Warl' steeks ye oot, ne'er sit down an' yelp Like a doug, but bear bauldly yer heid, like a man— Keep yer e'e an' yer hert aye abune gif ye can! Noo, Warl', hae I wrang't ye?—thou kens best thysel'; Let them that hae try't thee an' lippen't thee tell; But, hark! i' yer lug, my puir hard-wurkin' brither, Lippen aye maist tae Heaven, tae yersel', an' yer mither!</field>
