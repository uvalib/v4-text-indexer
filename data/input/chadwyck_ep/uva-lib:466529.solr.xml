      <field name="fulltext">TO THE MEMBERS OF “THE CONVERSAZIONE SOCIETY,” ESTABLISHED AND STILL CONTINUED IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE Only those poems not appearing in the 1838 edition have been included here. THE BOOK OF YOUTH. TO ?, FIVE YEARS OLD. Delighted soul! that in thy new abode Dwellest contentedly and knowest not What men can mean who faint beneath the load Of mortal life and mourn an earthly lot; Who would believe thou wert so far from home? Who could suppose thee exiled or astray? This world of twilight whither thou art come Seems just as welcome as thy native day. That comely form, wherein thy thoughts are pent, Hiding its rebel nature, serves thee still, A pliable and pleasant instrument, Harmonious to thy impulses and will. Thou hast not spent as yet thy little store Of happy instincts:—Thou canst still beguile Painful reflection and ungrateful lore With many a placid dream and causeless smile. And when the awful stranger Evil bends His eye upon thee, Thou wilt first essay To turn him from his dark pursuits and ends By gracious dalliance and familiar play: As well might kindly words arrest the roll Of billows raging o'er a wintry sea,— O Providence! remit to this one soul Its destined years, and take it back to Thee. [Six years, six cycles of dead hours] Oh! that I were, as I was, in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my Tabernacle! Job xxix. 4. Six years, six cycles of dead hours, Six falls of leaves, six births of flowers! It is not that, you know full well, That makes my labouring bosom swell, 'Tis not the memory of lost Time, Since last I heard that matin chime, That brings to sense the sleeping sorrow, To bid this long-left scene good-morrow,— It is the curse to feel as Men, And be not now as we were then. The snowy down on yonder hill Through thousand summers glistens still,— Yon stream will ne'er to time surrender Its rapid path of diamond splendour,— Yon orb, but now who swept the East, With train of ruby' and amethyst, Rides on, unweariedly as ever, O'er frowning rock, and glittering river; Those trees, I own, are somewhat higher,— The ivy round the village spire In fuller-clustering leaf has grown,— We cannot call that cot our own,— But what has changed in this sweet glen As we from what our hearts were then? Say you, the glow of Hope is bright, Or, if it be a meteor light, That hurtles through the thickening sky, 'Tis wise to catch it ere it die? Tell you me, 'tis a joy to feel Our toil increase a fellow's weal? That, 'mid these fainting, fading, bowers, There linger still some amaranth flowers, And honest will, and honest prayer, Will find them lurking everywhere?— Say on, I can but add, Amen,— We are not now as we were then. Oh, Brother! when I gaze upon These tombs of little blisses gone,— When, through the dense and steamy air, Which we with men are wont to share, A breeze of distant Youth has stole In freshness on my fever'd soul,— I feel like one who long has lain With madness gathering in his brain, And, bursting from the strong distress, Wakes to a terrible consciousness. Then blame you that my pulse beat now? Blame you the agony on my brow? Time was, when fear was all a stranger, Ere knowledge showed the way to danger— When love was firm,—when faith was sure, And head and heart alike secure;— But now, . . . Remember you a flower, Which we with care, from sun and shower,— It was our mother's,—loved to guard, And how we joyed in our reward, When first we watched its bloom appear, When it was old so many a year; And how we heard, with tearful eye, The good old gardener's prophecy,— For he was deep in nature's lore,— That that bright plant would bloom no more? The flowers fell off,—the stalk was gathered,— The root grew dry,—the lank leaves withered,— And, sad to lose its only pride, The poor Agave sunk and died: our one, our only bloom is gone, But, Brother, still we linger on. Between the cradle and the shroud, If chance, amid the pilgrim croud, Though strange the time and strange the place, We light on some familiar face, Once loved and known, as friend knows friend, In whom a thousand memories blend, Which whilom slumbered dull and dim, But rise in light and cling to him; Though not a line of old as wont, Though care has knit the ample front, And vice unstrung the well-toned frame, Still something,—something is the same. But if we ever hope to find Some traces in that life-worn mind Of its pure self, its simple being, Such as it was, when, unforeseeing, We thought that Nature's laws would fail, Ere Sin could make its boldness quail; Such as it was, ere sensuous things Had clipped the bird of Eden's wings, Ere stifled groan and secret sigh Replaced the tear so soon brushed by,— 'Tis vain,—alas, for human shame! There nothing, nothing is the same. Oh! that the painter's favourite scheme Were not alone a painter's dream! Oh! that the Paradise he feigns, Where Innocence with Childhood reigns, And cherub forms and infant guise Inclose the heart divinely wise, Were not alone a Poet's creed,— No symbol,—but a truth indeed! That all this circling life might close Its wearied course where first it rose, And that our second life might be A new, eternal, infancy, Keeping the bliss we lose as men, And being aye as we were then! [Back again, back again!] By eating the fruit that grows on the banks of the river of Delight, in the Anostum, in the country of the Meropes, men gain a blessed course of life, without one moment of sadness;—when they are in years, by little and little they wax young again, recovering their former vigour and force, and thence they turn still backward, even to their first infancy, becoming little babes again, and then they die. Antonio de Torquemada. Back again, back again! We are passing back again; We are ceasing to be men! Without the strife Of waning life, Or weary fears Of loveless years,— Without the darkened eye, Without the paling brow, Without a pulse of pain, Out of our maturity, We are passing now Back again! Clap your hands! clap your hands! Now are broken all the bands Of dull forms and phantom power, That could prevent us doing What joy would wish to do,— For out of manhood's ruin, We are growing, hour by hour, Happy children too!— From out the din And storm of sin, From out the fight Of wrong and right, Where the wrong Is all too strong, We glide our backward course along: From out the chilly weather, In which we laid, of old, Our hearts so close together, To keep them from the cold:— From the folly of the wise, From the petty war of gain, From Pleasure's painèd votaries, We are hasting back again, Into other, healthier, lands,— Clap your hands,— Back again! Faery fruit! faery fruit! Can our charmèd hearts be mute, When they feel at work within Thine almighty medicine? Joy through all our hearts is tingling,— Joy with our life-blood is mingling,— Before us rise The dancing eyes, That cannot speak Of aught but light, Unknowing gloom,— The rounded cheek, For ever bright With cool, red, bloom;— Our faded leaves are closing, Our petals are reposing Within their undeveloped stem;— It is beautiful to see Archetypes of infancy, For we are growing like to them. The wisdom of the common earth, And reason's servile royalty, Dust to dust,—the nothing-worth,— Tread it down triumphantly, To a just oblivion,— Freely-springing hearts and pure, Who are putting on Consecrated vestiture Of a new, old, communion!— Our home! our home! Our native air,—our brothers' song, That we have lost so long! We are worthy now to come, Where dwelleth the Divine;— Through the narrow door of Death Pass;—we breathe eternal breath,— Father! father! we are thine! THE BOOK OF FRIENDSHIP. FROM ITALY. It is a happy thought, I ween, That, with my heart and fancy free, Though seas and nations lie between, I still am side by side with Thee. Though strange in this illustrious land, Distraught by many a pleasant care, One simple trace of thy dear hand Begets me wings and takes me there. I sit within thy small still room, I feel thy low-embreathèd tone Come towards me, in the evening gloom,— I live for thee and thee alone. And, where yon lime's colossal bower Draws out its long impleachèd aisle, I walk with thee the noontide hour, Listen thy laugh and watch thy smile. Thou too, from out the planet croud, Of which thou art the life and sun, When answered jest and frolic loud Goad the light moments as they run,— Wilt send thy heart a silent way On embassy of love to me,— And, trust me, be it night or day, I shall receive it royally. Thus, though in outward space apart, I see thee, hear thee, know thee true; For, versed in Friendship's sacred art, The Spirit has its senses too. THE BOOK OF REFLECTION. THE FLOWER-GARDEN. O pensive Sister! thy tear-darkened gaze I understand, whene'er thou look'st upon The Garden's gilded green and colour'd blaze, The gay society of flowers and sun. Thou thinkest of the withering that must come, The quenching of this radiance all around, The hastening change in Nature's merriest home, The future blackness of the orphaned ground. Thou thinkest too of those more precious blooms, The firstling honours of thy Life's fresh field, The childly feelings that have all their tombs, The hopes of youth that now no odours yield: Still many a blessèd sense in living glee, Waves its bright form to glorify thy breast, But this fair scene's perverse morality Tells thee, they all will perish like the rest: Yet pluck them, hurt them not; whate'er betides, Touch not with wilful force those flowers or thine,— Let Death receive them his inviolate brides, They are the destined vestals of his shrine. And if those children of the insensate earth Go down in peace to a prolific grave,— If Nature raises in continuous birth The plant whose present grace she will not save,— So some deep-grounded root or visible seed, When these Heart-blossoms fade, may still remain, In a new season of thy Being, decreed To rise to light and loveliness again. THE BOOK OF SORROW. THE WORLD'S EXILE. Well, I will tell you, kind adviser, Why thus I ever roam In distant lands, nor wish to guide My footsteps to the fair hill-side Where stands my sacred home. My home! I seem to write that word, In characters more clear Than other words,—more slowly round I draw my pen, to keep the sound Still lingering in my ear. For were my wearied life allowed To choose that quiet bourne, I should be met by straining eyes, Welcoming tears, and grateful sighs, To hallow my return. But between me and that blest place, There lies a bar, I feel, More hard to pass, more girt with awe, Than any power of injured law, Or front of bristling steel,— Or the proud world's anathema, Or high imperial ban; I know it would be sacrilege For me to touch that threshold's edge,— I am an unclean man! Not that, in things of Man's esteem, I bear a mark of shame, Wealth fairly won, and never turned To sordid use or wrong, has earned My honourable name. But where has been my walk of life? Have I not grown half grey Within the lazar-house, and there Have fed upon the envenomed air, Unconscious day by day? How long ago the poisonous rain Distilled its deadly cold Upon my warm and panting youth, That had no instinct but for truth, No thought of self or gold! How the hard leprous scales defiled The bloom so fresh before, How soon they taught my virgin eyes To unlearn the glorious mysteries They saw so clear of yore! And in their place came vexèd thoughts, And hopes without a goal, Unjust regards, and false esteems, And worship of fantastic dreams, To paralyse my soul. Perchance, if I were placed once more Within the ancient pale Of Home and homely things, once more Beheld beside the rustic door The bowery rose down-trail,— And saw the bed at whose low side I prayed, a thankful boy, Where I have read, by stealthy light, Some marvellous tale, till past midnight, In deep and trembling joy; The casement too, with light wood latch, Where 'twas my happy wont To push the ivy half away, And let the unchecked moon-stream play Over my thirsty front; And when I felt a parent's kiss Lie warm upon my cheek,— Such sympathies so long foregone Would make, in their sweet guerison, The veriest savage meek. The passion of that influence Could not be vain to me, The tide of love would be so strong, I might perchance be borne along, And be one moment free. That could not last,—the Mammon King Would be indeed too blind, Thus to give up his long-won prey, And loose the chains, in one short day, It took him years to bind. The heart, that with its luscious cates The world has fed so long, Could never taste the simple food That gives fresh virtue to the good, Fresh vigour to the strong. What witchery, to a blunted spirit, Can give the rapid sense Of all that's true, and just, and kind, And beautiful, that lights the mind Of dauntless innocence? The very health of these pure lives, To my distempered sight, Would wear a rude unseemly guise,— Oh! shame that darkness dare despise The Ministers of light!— I could not join their honest mirth, Nor share their artless plays, Each earnest laugh would come to me, Freighted with bitterest mockery, Out of my early days. The plain old songs, all known by heart, The merry-chorused round, The imperfect notes, that childhood sings For its own glee, would now be things Of faint and rapid sound. The evening hymn, when every voice After our father prayed, Oldest with youngest richly blent, Followed the simple instrument My gentle Mother played. That herald of their happy rest, Closing their happy day, Would chase from me all thought of sleep,— Alas! I might not even weep, For the bliss I had thrown away. But discontent and dark unrest Would thicken all the air, Envy, of thwarted conscience born, Envy, that cloaks itself in scorn, Would haunt me everywhere. I might blaspheme the holy joys From which my soul is riven, And wroth to find my heart so dumb, While theirs were sweetly-voiced, become A Demon in that heaven. At last, I feel, I might grow mad, For my distorted brain Would faint beneath the hideous rack— Force me in ten-fold misery back To the waste world again. Then let me linger where I am, An exile if you will,— But, Friend, remember, if I flee To my old home, I there must be A greater exile still. THE BOOK OF DEATH. THE BROTHERS. 'Tis true, that we can sometimes speak of Death, Even of the Deaths of those we love the best, Without dismay or terror; we can sit In serious calm beneath deciduous trees, And count the leaves, scarce heavier than the air, That leave the branch and tremble to the ground; Or out at midnight in a gliding boat Enjoy the waning moon and moralize, And say that Death is but a Mediator Between the lower and the loftier Life. Thus it may be with those, who only know The great Invader, as he sometimes comes Dismantled of his full ferocity, Taking almost a grace of gentleness From the surrounding atmosphere of Love, Seeming to pity what himself inflicts, When with soft touch he draws away the chair From the familiar circle, and lays down The suffering burden on an easy bed, More like a weary traveller seeking sleep Than the weak victim of a Tyrant's will. For then Affection has a thousand moods, With which to soothe the black necessity, And form his rigid features to a smile;— There are the tender dues of every hour, The pillows nightly smoothed by hands just kissed, The active care that guards the wakening eye, The cautious thoughtfulness of earnest love, The sedulous record of each smallest word, The looks whose pain is steeped in balmy tears, The tones, that growing weaker day by day Keep strong in love as ever, to the last,— All after-treasures of consoling wealth, For the heart's casket of departed things. But when, like the Malay who, mad for blood, And raving onward, deals on either side Precipitate blows of unaccounted rage, The Evil seems to meet us; when he strikes, In some unwonted, strangely-cruel, way, Which even in fiction would have foully jarred Against the regular calm of daily thought, And broken, like a crash of lawless war, On our mind's peace; and when, to point the sting, Some simplest instrument of common use Conveys the poison, then the Demon wears His native horror,—Death is Death indeed! To read some twenty words in black and white, And be made wretched for one's life to come! To be laid senseless by a certain form Of syllables pronounced in a low voice! To see a cloud of gathering agony Upon the forehead of a trusty friend, And almost ere the name has passed his lips, The name of some one that we both adore, To know that One is dead, is gone, is dead, When, how, we do not know, we do not ask, Wrapped up in that immense idea of “dead,” And sensible to nothing else or more! I know not which is worse,—this stunning shock, This sudden transformation of our being Into one whole of pain, or that thick coil Of expectation, presages, and fears, Which winds itself so close about our heart, When first the barely-possible event Of such a loss takes substance in the mind, And then, as every languid-lingering day Brings fear more nigh to desolate certainty, Tighter and tighter draw the racking bonds, Till anguish can no longer be contained, But bursts into loud passion, to sink down Into dumb stupor. Reader! the hard fates Of those, who in these tributary lines May find some shield from a forgetting world, Tried with this double strain of Misery, The souls of those who loved them; Reader! pray That this exceeding sorrow may not fall Back to its hell, barren of holy fruit,— That through these two deep rents which woe has made In their most sacred feelings, they may see Into the peaceful Heaven that lies beyond. There were two Brothers, of near kin to me,— We've played together many a summer eve, In that short maidenhood of Life when eve Can find the heart no heavier than at morn, And day and darkness are all one in joy; They grew together from the self same stem, Of little different heights, together drank The dews of love and close domestic care, Together sprouted out their vigorous green As Nature's secret will devised the way. And when the birthright Beauty, bold and free, Of high-born English boys, was ripening fast Upon them, home, its halls, and groves, and fields, Were silent of those two accustomed voices, Nearly at the same time,—how soon to be Silent of them for ever! They went forth Into the distances of land and sea, One far away, then nearer, then more far, The roving comrade of the roving waves,— The other, by the duty of the sword, Taken to pleasant places, where the arm Of British power extends its guardian strength O'er stranger lands too weak to stand alone. Thus after various changes, wanderings, And hard experiences of manly life, In that delicious spot, whose central charms Embrace the eastern and the western earth, The fairest of the fair Ionian isles, The Brothers met once more;—the other's face Each looked upon, nor knew it was his brother's;— For in our mortal spring the craftsman Time Is active to destroy and recreate, Both in the inner and the outer Man; But joyous recognition soon came on, First by degrees, then in a rapid flash, And the old chain of kind fraternity Was linked afresh, and, for some few short days, The Nature of that island-paradise Witnessed their love, witnessed their social sports, And interchange of happiest memories. Beneath the olive-grove's fine-fretted vault, They spoke together of the beechen shades, Spread in broad masses round their distant home;— On that cliff-platform, where the large sea-bird Floats level by, and the sail-studded strait Lies like a lake within that crescent coast And the full breast-work of Albanian hills, They talked of that dear terrace whose smooth length Is stretched before their childhood's lordly home, Above the lawny green befringed with flowers, And sleepy stream and swelling meads beyond. Into the gulf of the absorbing past, Those lightly-pinioned hours past one by one; And then the Soldier and the Sailor stood, For the last time, together on the deck, While slow the sails expanded their white breasts In the caresses of the lover breeze. I am a student of the Heart of Man, And thus 'tis not in curious wilfulness, That I would know, whether some deeper sense Than of mere pain at parting did not pass Athwart their spirits, as they turned away? Whether did not a stern presentiment Of many-folded evil hanging round The personality of their two lives Cast a dense shade upon the paths that led Over the Future's hope-illumined plain, And make the words of sweet encouragement Faint on their mutual lips, and string their hands With a convulsive force in that last grasp, And dim with sudden mist their tearless eyes? To tell the sum of this sad tale, few words Are best and all-sufficient;—to display The forms of pain and death and misery, With an elaborate anatomic skill, And mould the stark realities of ill Into fantastic shapes of speech and thought, Is not the Poet's function, must not be:— He knows the fineness of his music-strings, The tender fibres of all-human love, And will not strike them with a reckless hand, As if he beat upon a savage drum. Enough, that ere the earth its annual round Had many times accomplished, those bright boys Had met strange deaths, both strange tho' different:— The one, from all his comrades singled out By a mysterious hazard, the sure aim Of an assassin's hand broke off the bough Of his full fragrant promise,—he is laid In that warm foreign dust,—rude soldier tears Have dropped upon his decorated tomb. The other, ere this wound unhealable Had lost the first intenseness of its sore, Perished without a trace, without a sign, In the huge ocean-deserts of the North, He, and his fellows, and their dwelling-place, One doom for all,—one darkness undisturbed,— One desolation for affection's shrine. We all have read and loved the lovely plaint, In which the Lyrist, whose most grateful blooms Spring from the root of purest womanhood, Has hymned the “Household's” widely scattered “Graves;” There's not a verse but has been wept upon;— And I could wish this not dissimilar theme Had found such skill to work it to such end; But my faint strain expects no stranger tears,— It is the homage of a kinsman's grief Written for kindred, nor has other claim: They will inform the vague imperfect frame With inward-flowing music of their own, The melodies of mournful recollections, The supplement of personal interest, The sympathies that come far out to meet you, And other judgment I acknowledge none. ON THE DEATH OF ? I'm not where I was yesterday, Though my home be still the same, For I have lost the veriest friend Whom ever a friend could name; I'm not where I was yesterday, Though change there be little to see, For a part of myself has lapsed away From Time to Eternity. I have lost a thought that many a year Was most familiar food To my inmost mind, by night or day, In merry or plaintive mood; I have lost a hope, that many a year Looked far on a gleaming way, When the walls of Life were closing round, And the sky was sombre grey. For long, too long, in distant climes My lot was cast, and then, A frail and casual intercourse Was all I had with men; But lonelily in distant climes I was well content to roam, And felt no void, for my heart was full O' the friend it had left at home. And now I was close to my native shores, And I felt him at my side, His spirit was in that homeward wind, His voice in that homeward tide: For what were to me my native shores, But that they held the scene, Where my youth's most genial flowers had blown, And affection's root had been? I thought, how should I see him first, How should our hands first meet, Within his room,—upon the stair,— At the corner of the street? I thought, where should I hear him first, How catch his greeting tone,— And thus I went up to his door, And they told me he was gone! Oh! what is Life but a sum of love, And Death but to lose it all? Weeds be for those that are left behind, And not for those that fall! And now how mighty a sum of love Is lost for ever to me . . . . . . . . . No, I'm not what I was yesterday, Though change there be little to see. TWO VISITS TO A GRAVE. I stood by the grave of one beloved, On a chill and windless night,— When not a blade of grass was moved, In its rigid sheath of white. The starry armament looked down, From the glassy waste the while, Perchance they could not seem to frown, But they did not seem to smile. Long time had past since they laid him there, But I heeded not of time, I knew the stone, tho' blank and bare, Unmarked by line or rhyme. Madly I wept that I had been Over the wild wild sea, When he had found in this last scene, A home and a privacy. The gloomy stillness of the hour Came coldly to my heart, And Faith and Hope grew weak in power To soothe the sinner's smart; I almost cursed the good great God,— And vowed that I would be Even as he beneath the sod, Tho' I had not lived as he. I left the tomb,—I ceased to weep,— But grisly forms of pain Came thronging from the fields of sleep, And forced me back again. That morn the hoar-frost still was there, In place of balmy dew,— Unshaken was the silvered hair Of the old church-yard yew. I heard a company of birds Their grateful carol troll, And a sense of prayer, too much for words, Arose within my soul. The web of early mist was gone, Fresh-wove in nature's loom, For the sun, like a bold free spirit, shone Clear on the glistening tomb. I worshipped, as the gold flood poured On the scene, before so dim; And when the Beautiful I adored, My thoughts were still of him. I thought, I prayed, and thus became More full of sweet content, Watching the sun-beams gently frame The earth to merriment. I was not happy, but I prayed, At heart, that I might not be As he who in that grave was laid, Till I had lived as he. SONNETS. XIV. ON A NOBLE CHILD, EARLY DEAD. Farewell to thee, thou swift-departed Stranger, Weary with little stay,—farewell to thee! There hung a picture in thy nursery Of the God-boy, who slumbered in the manger,— And oft I feared, lest Thou should'st meet the danger, For pride of wealth or lusted empiry, Of losing that which I so loved to see, Thy likeness to that picture, lovely Stranger. Thou hast gone back all pure,—thy every feature Faithful to what the limner's sacred eye Pourtrayed the Son of God; most blessed creature! Thy brow unknit by passion, pain, or scorn, Thine is the special privilege to have borne The Cross of Love without the Agony. SONGS. II. FROM THE VENETIAN OF BURATTI. I. Pleasant were it, Nina mine! Could our Hearts, by fairy powers, Renovate their life divine, Like the trees and herbs and flowers. So might we, in fond accord, As the fresh ripe Hearts appear; Each the other's Love reward, With the first-fruits of the year. Fragrance from that wondrous plant Might your giddy sex restrain,— Such refreshment would enchant The most faithless back again. But in restless pleasure using One poor Heart, from year to year, We shall both our Hearts be losing,— Worn to nothing,—Nina dear! II. Oh! what a May-day,—what a dear May-day! Feel, what a breeze, love, Undulates o'er us,— Meadow and trees, love, Glisten before us,— Light, in all showers, Falls from the flowers, Hear, how they ask us, “Come and sit down.”—(Bis.) Well, let us rest with them,—well let us rest with them, Two other blossoms, Quiet and lonely, While from their bosoms Nightingales only Secrets revealing, We shall be stealing Things that most surely the world doesn't know.—(Bis.) Guess, my own Nina,—guess, my own Nina, What they are singing! That a deep passion, Rooted and clinging I' the right fashion, Never can measure Fulness of pleasure, But when together alone,—all alone!—(Bis.) Fare you well, old world!—fare you well, old world! This one is ours, Shepherds,—May-weather,— We and the flowers Blooming together,— Where, never jealous, Nightingales tell us What they know, oh! how much, better than we!—(Bis.) VI. [Grief sat beside the fount of tears] Grief sat beside the fount of tears, And dipt her garland in it, While all the paly flowers she wears Grew fainter every minute. Joy gamboled by the other side, In gay and artless guise, And to her gloomy sister cried, With laughter in her eyes— “Oh! prithee leave that stupid task, That melancholy fountain; I go in Pleasure's sun to bask, Or dance up Fancy's mountain.” “Insolent fooler!—go—beware,” Said Grief, in moody tone, “How thus you frivolously dare Approach my solemn throne!” And then, on Joy's fair wreath she threw, With sideward glance of malice, Some drops of that embitter'd dew Fresh from a poison'd chalice. But Joy laugh'd on;—“In vain, in vain You try to blight one flower; That which you meant for fatal bane Shall prove my brightest dower:— “Friendship and Love on every leaf Shall wear the pearly toy, And all, who shrink from tears of Grief, Shall pray for tears of Joy.” VII. A LAMENT. I hear them upbraid you,—they mingle your name With lightness and folly and almost with shame; And they, who have crouched at the bend of your brow, With familiar indifference prate of you now. Where now is the fountain of beauty and joy, That thrilled through the heart of the care-hating boy? With love, and with music, that fountain plays on,— But the spirit, that basked in its freshness, is gone. Oh! were it stern Science that led you away, Or a flow of dark feeling that made you less gay, I should mourn that so early the shadows were cast, But the path might have led into sunlight at last. Not so, now the world, with its gilding and glare, Has bid you to pleasure, and prisoned you there; And the blazoned saloon, and the mirth-breathing hall, And silver-sweet flatteries, hold you in thrall: For the friends of your boyhood—the innocent few, Whose hearts knew you well, and whose hearts you too knew, From their home in your breast have been forced, one by one,— And in that bleak place can I linger alone? I too must begone,—with those who have seen The manifold promise of what you have been, Though they who so loved will still gaze from afar, If it be but to weep, when they see what you are.
