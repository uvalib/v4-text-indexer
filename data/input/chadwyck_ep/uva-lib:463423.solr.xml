      <field name="fulltext">JOHN LANE'S FIRST DEDICATION. To the illustrious Classis of Poetes Laureate in bothe the famous Vniuersities. LANE'S FRESH DEDICATION. The Muse, to the soveraigne bewtie of our most noble and illustrious Ladie, the virtuous Queene Marie, wiefe of our adreadded soveraign Lord, Kinge Charles, &amp;c. M Maie not an olive branch of Peace, Truith, Loue, a att heavnlie zeales flame, tyne more lampes with yee? r rouze vp thy fethers √î meeke Turtle-Dove! i invert eake the seaes rage! so heere shall see a, armes yeild to Loue, Truith, Iustice, foes agree. A Above all Virtewes, Loue is soveraigne, n nor was theare ever Faith without trewe Loue, g gives fier to concord, peace, truith, iustice traine; l Loue conquers Hate, as heere twoe Ladies prove: i in whose perspective mirrour cleere is seene ae: Englandes lacke, supplied in yee Faerie Queene, C Com then! that Temperances sober feast M. maie all invite, from brawles, to tranquil rest! Your maiesties most humble subiect, John Lane. The Muse to the fowre windes. I had to Poetes an alarum given, and told a Plowmans tale of twelve monthes longe, and righted Gwy of Warwicke (now in heavn), and more Poeticke visions troopd amonge; but Licence and the Press have twoe condicions, that hurt more then they heale, yet no Phisiciens. thus maie this Philomel hush vp her Lay, sith Printers maie not preach, yet they will pray. J. L. Thomas Windham, Kensfordiae, Somersettensis, armiger, ad authorem. The ivie needes not, wheare theare is good wine, nor thy booke, praises of my slender muse, sithe love, truith, iustice, in it cleere doe shine, which iron age hathe driven out of vse: no tonge, nor penn, cann this thy verse abuse, but Bayard blind, that drosse for gold dothe chouse/ Edwardus Carpenter. Thy poem shewes, wheare love the scales dothe hold, iustice, and truith, convertes at everie ende, from whence no hurt cann comm to younge or old; concord and musicke doe the same intend; Which fyve, reducd, somms vp one vnitie, as sweetlie chauntes thy tragecomidie Matthew Jefferies, master of Choristers of the cathedral church of welles, to his frende. I was the firste that, with ann oten quill, (skoringe thy lines), fast caught dread James his eare, With serious heede, to love Apolloes skill, thoughe of my notes, no notice woold appeare: but dienge now, frend, thy love-tyninge muse awakes my spirit, which but awaites for heavn to contest with thie musical issues, Which all the speares, harmoniouslie reweaven, Whither (naie higher farr) I now ascend, and leave my memorie with thee, my frend/ John Melton, Cittisen of London, most lovinge of musicke, to his frend J. L. Right well I knowe, that vnites, eightes, fyvths, thirdes, from discordes, and cromatickes, doe abhorr, thoughe heavnlie reason bares with those absurdes to musickes Class, for love sake, to restore. but tell me, Lane, how canste thow this approve, that wee presume on musicke, with-out love? George Hancocke, Somersettensis, to his frende, J. L. So ringe the peale of love, truith, iustice out, as it, into theire choire, all heerers chime; so cease the belles, of discordes dismal rowt, as it entewne this harmonie divine; so virtues flame woold loves sweete lampe entine, as Chaucer, Lidgate, Sidney, Spencer dead, yett livinge swanns, singe out what thow haste sedd? [Continuation of Chaucer's ‚ÄòSquire's Tale‚Äô] John Lane's introductory selections from Chaucer have been omitted. Thus farr Chaucer. Now followeth a supplie to what heereof is missinge; finished by John Lane, anno Domini 1615. Lectori acrosticum. I graunt my barcke, ores, men, too slowe, weake, pale, of standinge within kenn of Chaucers quill, Howbeet, least Elde mote robb his Squiers loste tale neere point of reskewe, pittye steeres my keel, Lamentinge with the muses, suche a losse, as richer peece near Poetes head begunn. Now sithe no allegorie blabbs owne glosse, ende, meanlie ended, bett'r is, then vndon. Canto Tercio. A roial ioust Cambuscan calles, and theareto buildes a theatere: his towne Fregilia stirreth brawles, theventes wheareof Canac dothe feare. Apollo whirleth vp his chaire so hye, till that the god Mercurius house he flye' in glorious progresse, leavs behind him th'In of smylinge Gemini (that lustie twin). now all exhaeld, springes gusshinge in longe raine, declard heauns wrath staies, to shine drie againe. Auroraes soft hand dilld vp haulls, and bowres, feildes, gardines, groves, with leaves, buddes, blossoms, flowrs, everye trim sweete, that Zephirs breath had blest; frolickd all birdes, for younge ones weale, in nest; beastes, eake in new bloodes livelhode, pleasure tooke, by fountaines mild, cleere silver spowtinge brooke, which neighbourd shadye woodes; whither they brize, to hide them from the stinges of busye flies; all that doffd Hiems old clothes dond newe forme, t'enioye owne ioies, and thearewith greete the morn; while Philomels dirges had wakinge kept her muse, for love gott, whose late losse shee wept. ‚Äú√î,‚Äù quoth Cambuscan, ‚Äúthis mote skore my shame, that golden Titan hathe clomb heauens frame, and I (a kinge) praevented not his time, it moste concernes vs, whoe sytt most sublime, to have the first ears vp, and wakened eyes, to're see and heere our lawlesse companies: sith to trust servauntes in our stead dothe learn them bribe-full riche, while all theire faultes wee earn.‚Äù his care, evn a charge vniuersal stoode, ore male, female, younge, old, great, small, badd, good, but chieflye for owne blood, and familie, for all collateral interest, thronges so nye, as it may sytt, when others muste stande by; sollicitors it needeth none, for whie, nature still pleades for consanguinitie, by th' interest of kind proximitie. His deerest daughter oft came to his minde, ann honorable match for her to fynd, sithe ripe yeeres now fytt husband craves to gifte, which to neglect, maides for them selves will shift, and chouse them pheares of base disparagement, then which nought more abhorrs to the parent. He sawe his twoe sonnes divers dispositions, thone carefull, thother carelesse, of conditions. albeet he fraught theare minde with faire decore of truith, iustice (twins), groundes of virtues lore, to gaine trewe honor bye; meaninge, in deede, that as theire sensative traducd his seede, right so hee woold theire reasons fyer divine with his shoold ioine, and one loves flame entine. He founde, thoughe parentes some of these instill, yet good and ill choice restes at childrens will. Againe hee sawe, that but meere speculation attaines not the full ende of contemplation, thoughe some sonnes, livinge vnder fathers eye, may chaunce demeane them as preceptualie, but, breakinge loose, deigne purpose what them liste. All which, by longe experience, well hee wiste, ‚Äúfor‚Äù (quoth hee) ‚Äúnot a daie rolles ore my head, but some badd newes of Algarsife is sedd. some sweare hee riott runns at everie pleasure, and in all companies spendes without measure; well learnt in glories schoole to glasse to th' eye, th'opinion of him selfe, and it deifye: the fruites wheareof binn anie vile misschife; yet flatterers vaunt, all becoms Algarsife. but, by my swoord, I sweare, If hee note mend, my heritage to him shall near discend.‚Äù and theare hee pawzd, while love and indignation held in his inwardes serious disceptation, what fathers love mote doe, and iustice kept! Anon into his minde this priect stept, that thus hee woold his cares and grand affaires distribute (for his ease) amongst his heires, as thus: His dearlinge Canac, hee'l propose, to all, that oth'r in vertue overgoes. Algarsiue and Camballo, they shall wyve, to trye, if wives wittes makes their husbandes thrive, knowinge, this keepes vp th'onor of his house, that knightes bee knightlye meritorious: and holdes this aye, for soundest demonstration, his praesidentes bee to theire immitation. By this, the dialles finger stood noone tide, when as Cambuscan to his diett hied, fore whome stoode store of rare and rathe ripe cate, accordinge as the season them begate; service, and servitors, cladd lustrant neate, and not a disshe vsurpd his fellowes seate, while the tall sewer the first course ledd in, lowd musicke told, what state was theare beeseen: and so as th' first, the seconde course was spedd, with different musickes, in the formers stedd. after the void, praeserves in silvern plate set suche a postscripte to ann antedate, as not a common penn knowes to define great Princes dietes in festival time. Now, as the musickes filld the vaultie haull with glorious straines composd caelestial, no mans witt knewe by sense to wishe for more, for that owne feelinge felt it theare afore, most iudgementes beinge lost to their owne witt, for so great glories, so gann ravishe it. Above Cambuscan sate his glorious queene, good Ethel, veild in blewest heavens sheene, which all illuminated with her eye, that bore foorthe suche a soveraigne maiestie, as wheather it more daunted, or advoked, none knewe, till virtues hand wrote, mowth had spoke it, a Goddesse in their hartes th'installed her. But when they viewd yonge Canac syttinge ner, so bright, pure, simple, meeke, white, redd, wise, faire, no wonder knewe, how to compare the paire, only they deemd Canac, by so much lesse, as daughters binn, then theire progenitresse: howbeet parentale love so equald them, as knowes Astreaes skales and Poetes penn./ ‚ÄúMayd‚Äù (quoth Cambuscan), to Canacy then (pleasantlie smilinge): (shee, as blithe agen,) ‚Äúmy maydd, I pray, wheare is your hart becomm?‚Äù with all, takinge the nact'r and tastinge somm, ‚Äúheere, heer's ann helthe to thy first husbandes wife!‚Äù At that Camballo laughd, and Algarsife, but Canac blushd as sweetest morn in may, and queene Ethelta ioyd, as att a playe, vrginge the kinge shoold pledgd bee, through the table. so round the loves draught went, like measurable, everie one ioyenge how it wrought (once in), till all the round went on a mirrie pinn. ‚ÄúAnd‚Äù (quoth Cambuscan) ‚Äúyee, my lovelie boyes, because I meane, t'endow alike your ioies, all yee three shalbee marryed on a daye, in my owne court, in best and nobliste raye; wheare shall assemble all th'nobilitie, on notice sent to th'Land of faerie. So shall the chivalrie of everie Courte, wheare fame, or honor, ever made resort, and all faire Ladies, dwell they farr or neare, shall have their bewties tryed by swoord and speare; and everie knight which best in fight him beare, shall have a Ladye worthie of his phere; with honor donn them in humanitie, after the manner of old faerie; Wantinge theare, in the meane, no entertaine, as well for them as for theire horse and traine. but knightes and Ladies, wanting dewe desart, shall (as they came) by lawe of armes depart.‚Äù Tho purseyvauntes and heraudes hee bid call, whoe foorthwith stoode before him in the haul, in riche cote armors (as that office blasethe), with solemne trumpetes, whome the people gazeth. ‚ÄúGoe quicke‚Äù (quoth hee), ‚Äúand this my will proclaime, in courtes and campes wheare honor men darraigne, and saye, that vertue, to more noble make, when Sol, the martial Lion shall o'retake, evn this daie fortie daies, in Serra towne I will propose the prize of faire renowne: my ioye, love, life, my deerest-bewtie deere, my onlie daughter Canac present heere, whose truith and bewtie Cambal will maintaine, with speare, swoord, sheild, to bee moste soveraigne and looke, whoe by knightes service and desert, her winns, shall have my land too with my hart, and all that Camballs courage makes not good, I will:‚Äù so signd the warrant with his blood. and good queene Ethelta, midst of the haul, stood vp, and said ‚ÄúAmen!‚Äù so rose they all. At that all people out cried, ‚ÄúGod save the kinge,‚Äù and all their hattes gann tosse vp, catch, and flinge; for bee it right or wronge a kinge dothe treate, most peopl applaude it, as th'admire the greate: eccho repeatinge over all againe, trumpetes and shaggbuttes, cornetes, lowd acclaime, what everie steeples belles outrange in peale, which no mans tonge, ne hartes ioye, could conceale, wind and stringe musicke, on all instrumentes of sweete touche, quicke shake, nimblest dividentes, with straines on straines, exchaunginge mode and tyme, thither to call Pernassus sisters nyne; to harken at the gardine windowes howe these voices, and those violes, they allowe: ne Orpheus, Arion, Amphion coold more then robb men of them-selves to concordes lore: concorde proceedinge out of harmonie, harmonie, out of concordes melodie, melodie, out of musickes euphonie, euphonie, out of vnites symphonie; Love beinge semster, peace the sampler bore; the woodbirdes chirmes contestinge this vprore. But, ah! some musicke hathe cromaticke tunes, which the sweete notes discordantlie perfumes, for then Algarsife oft the lipp gann bytt, when first hee heard his father, (as hee sytt) depose, that hee whoe shoold Canace winn, should have his kingdom too, and her, and him. ‚ÄúBut I am eldest sonn,‚Äù (quoth Algarsife) ‚Äúwheareby the land is mine after his life; and if it bee my birthe-right to bee kinge, I brooke no partnership in suche a thinge:‚Äù So foorthe hee strooke, and, as he iettes elate, gann wincke with one eye at him selfe in state; imbibes eake with his aier, that emulation which soone degenerates owne education; sithe castinge, how his formes and faces viewe mote similize his father, yet vntrewe, and keepe in companie the worser sort, Paridlistes (the vile slaunder of the court) alluringe woomen, flattringe servinge men, ambitious plotters, tailers prowdinge them, bribers that teach to levie lawlesse coine, stabb-learninge fencers, carrowcers of wine, detractinge parasites, bringers of newes, false dice and carders, with all cheatinge crewes, siders that feede, nay blo selfe-gaine-made faction, suche setters idlie thrive, whoe lacke suche action. Naye, when hee by th' mill-pond syde, love did make to Merlins false love (th' Ladie of the Lake), hee on the liquid-simpringe-cristal sawe annother face, the which t' him-selfe to drawe, he calld, huggd, kissd: and to carrowse more pleasure, dranck vp a mer-maide, which him caught in th' seasure, whome false Videria vnderneathe had sett, to conceave by him (as hee liste begett) Fancie (the chaungelin of imagination), which blindlie speculates in perturbation, and swellinge, to it-selfe gann ravishe sense, in th' insolent miste of concupiscence. since when, of all his owne conceiptes which please him, his humoristes (as midwives) waite to ease him. whence they whoe fetche their counselles from times clock, the shollowe vulgus (waveringe weathercock) on Algarsife bowncd Phaetons highe praise, ‚Äúkind man,‚Äù ‚Äúbrave faerie knight,‚Äù not one but sayes hee will miraculous-straunge wonders doe in daye of turniament, when it comm too. some cleapd him bravest horseman: others guest him a stronge pike, and for foote service best. some praisd his legg, shape, spirit, witt, gesture, face, and so insinuate as to grace disgrace; othersome on the point of praise gann cavil, sithe drincke and smoke had biggd his vngirt navil. some smild hee was his fathers livelie bird, which lookd and spake like him at everie word: and, by owne humors, so gann valewe him, as hope proiectes owne purchas by his sinn. these weare his fleshe-flies, these him magnifies, yet bin his moste intestine enimies. But other folke, of tardier observation, noted Algarsifes straunge vnprincelie fasshion, how he disranckes him-selfe from noblest ranckes, and gives base praefaces of looser pranckes. all which they sawe, yet durst not reprehend, sithe principalities binn so esteemd, as they escape to pleasures had-I-wiste, vnkend, vntaxt of eye, tonge, rule, or fiste: Yea, theare the great swimm, flesht in Libertie, Wheare dares no prophet the fault specifye. Howbeet, they Camball sawe him beare at feaste as sober as the straungest-new-bid gwest, eake temperate as brave Phocion, stowt, austeare, so with Algarsif him they noold compare, sithe thone seemd but to pillcre fame by chaunce, thother by temperate-virtuous valiance to shewe, thoughe gule and avarice hunt for store, nature hath but owne needes, excesse hathe more. whence theire opinions thus gann halson it, how th'elder hath the land; th' yonger the witt. Whearefore they valued Camball, as of right, that promisd proofes of a trewe faerie knight. Cambuscan, in the meane time, had designd the rarest artisans that coste mote find; some architectes, which knewe all Geometrie, some curious kervers of imagerie, some liefe infusinge painters at the eye, some arras weavers, some of tapestrie, some astronomers; some trewe cronoclers, (√¥ rare! of times gestes not false registers.) and but one poet: swearinge it in rime, one Ph≈ìnix lives, one Poet at one time. With these rare wittes, Cambuscan pleasd conferr to build a large, highe-sumptuous theater, all to containe that coms, younge, old, riche, pore, openinge fro th' easte to th' weste, one throughfare dore to widen with the daye, and shutt at night. th'whole forme to bee as round as globe edight, with all the sphears, and each starr which dothe err, with the fixt starrs, and th'all sphears commover its vault stelliferous, of hardist blewe, full of faire lightes, for vp and downes reviewe; with the fowre windes to shutt and open them; the whole to rest vppon one axell stem, the spindle it sustaininge, streight to stand on well ioind mightie okes of faerie lande; which vnderground, even at the roote, shoold have wheeles crampt to wheeles, to move with waters wave. a glorious dial for the sonns hott race, with ground vp-spowtinge springes for blithe solace. ore againste these the learnd sciences seavn (the Cosmical considerers of Heaun); Its lowest flore to beare the basest sort, which (so they live) care not a good report; the higher roomes of mansions to consiste of them which more and more growe worthiest, wheather it bee a knight or ladie bright, the balence to weighe out their deedes by right. and some for soldiers, whoe in service gote graye heares and skarrs (the pathes of painefull note). but th'inner galleries that runn the round, if not with richest arras, hunge to ground, biddes hange vp th'arras of chast Dians storie (the cloistred misterie of old virgins glorie), which once Acteons lust-full eyes misconster so as it blew the flame, selfe blasd a monster, that rann to save owne passions in owne hart, was of them soone devowrd that fedd his smart. And those riche tapestries of Dido queene, longinge as muche to see as to bee seene of hard harted Eneas t' prove in sense, luste breedes not love, thoughe bloes concupiscence, which settinge selfe on fyer, selfelie consumes, custome begonn is bellowes, fewell, fumes. And looke what natures selfe hathe not supplyed, shall by queint painters hand bee storifyed, wheareof what is not vnderstoode of men, to bee demonstrated by poetes penn. lastelie, the local place of turnament shoold keepe the midle ward, or regiment of bothe those endes whose trophies thus shoold rise, at th'easte end truith, At the weste end Justice. his other embleams and conceiptes that weare in store, to bewtifye this theatere, weare infinite, and note by mee bee sedd (Don Chaucer, Lidgate, Sidney, Spencer dead); onlie hee willd his worckmen six make haste, ne spare for cost, while time owne lampe dothe wast. Cambuscan, glad his worcke was well begonn, vieringe a-round sawe a swifte horseman comm, amid the powldred duste that blindeth th'aier, to steale th' approche of dismall hastes repaire, wheare no grasse grewe vnder his horses feete, all while his horn blo, speedes his gallop fleete. some post hee seemd, that gallopd t' out-runn strife, yet none that rides in state, but runns for life. The kinge lookes vp; the post alightes at th' gate, and with his packet, of that morninges date, demaundes his present accesse to the kinge. the servauntes him respect (hast furtheringe). but Canac stoode at her glasse prospective in th'presence windowe, seeinge all arive, wheare shee mote lantskipp viewe and seas discrye, and wandringe travilers, bothe farr and nye, whence shee with speede discendes to meete the poste. Who, after baysaunce donn her, it discloste that Fregiley, the kinges provincial towne, tooke armes, and they turnd traitors to the crowne. his other newes weare but as general, suche as the vulgar catche before it fall, yet falles of course (as vsual), with state setters, to putt lies in postes mowthes, truithe in theire letters. Shee heard him out in all that was to gather, yet noold the packet ope without her father. tho, sendinge the post to th' kittchins warme repaste, she rann to seeke her fath'r in all the haste, vp hilles, down dales, all waies, from place to place, thoughe near could find him out, but wheare he was. at length, amongst his workfolke him shee spide, in a moste pleasinge meade by th' river syde, of soile most fertile; th' aier, groves, pure and sweete, helthelye temperate, and for pleasure meete; woodes gracing th' illes, flowres stord the humble plaines, ann happier seate longd not to his demaines, that perfumd all with sweetest balmes adore, and farr prospectes from land to land it bore. But now all's pleasanter, that shee is comm. ‚ÄúDeere Daughter,‚Äù (quoth hee) ‚Äúwhat ist makes yee ronn?‚Äù While shee, quite mute with runinge, breathd so fast, as if, mild Zephir loste, shee found his blast; heat openinge chirries, roses, pinckes, and all, white lillies, violetes blewe (her faces pall). fallinge on knee, gave vp (kissinge her hand) the packett, which badd newes gave tvnderstand. Hee kindlie tooke yt, and broke vp the seale, but oh! its first word gann all mirth repeale. whence turninge, lettinge face and letter fall, stoppd soddainlie, lookd vp: so leaves them all. Which seene, page Amidis stoopd for the Letter, in hope the cause or newes woold fall out better. But sadd Canac, seeinge her father gonn, shewd in her face her hart was allmost donn; for, in her mirror, shee foresawe and knewe great mischiffes could not chouse but thence ensewe. so to her selfe shee sobbd, like churlishe rayne which blubbrethe gardines bewties of disdaine. after shee hies her, with page Amidis, for it encreasd her griefe her lord to misse, whome sorrowfull, or as in extacie, shee founde, or rather, in diepe agonie. but then t' have seene how each beheld each other, mote soone impression strooke in anie lover. he, sorrowfull for Fregiley his towne; shee, heavie for the losse of trewe renowne. hee, pittienge her state and the common state; shee, greevinge what woold followe of debate. he melancholie, pale, entynd, offended; shee meekelie prayenge all weare well amended. Againe of Amidis hee tooke the letter, which read, hee thumpd his brest (as faultes old debter); oft sighinge as hee read it, shooke his head. ‚Äúh√¢ Fregiley, false Fregiley,‚Äù hee sedd. to Canac turninge tho (beinge betrayd), thus whispered, ‚ÄúTis the worse for thee, my mayd, thy fortunes daunger and thy hopes delaye, will blowes, blood, death, cost, in a mortal fray.‚Äù all which, on his smoothe browe engravd thintent of taminge rebelles: so it seemd hee ment. shee knewe yt well, wittnes more new comm tears, that hartie sighes are griefes betrothd compears. In this sadd plight a messenger is seene, bare headed, sent from Ethelta, the queene, lowtinge, that supp'r expectes his maiestie. but suche a supp'r as wayters near stood bye, for not three wordes amongst them all weare spoken, which that theire mindes wrought busier, did betoken, Onlie queene Ethelta gann storme, and vowe vengeance vppon all traiters hartes to plowe. Camball sayd nought: Algarsife was not theare, Which to new stirrs, more presages mote reare. By this bright Titan hidd at west his head in freckled white clowdes, turninge white to read, and redd to opal blacke: which soddaine lowre, foretold, the morne woold bringe foorth miste or showr. Canto quarto. Algarsife gainste his sier rebelles; queene Ethel vowes iust death thearefore; Canac, Videriaes witchcrafte telles, and learnes the brazen horses lore. The sable night (thoughtes wakefull counseler, cares chamberlaine, daungers percursiter), invited bothe the kinge and Queene to rest, that slumber mote those indigestes digest; but shee was so transported into ire, as all her d'signes thrett vengeance, swoord, &amp; fyer, for princelie state (once kinglie honor wounded) n'is safe till iustice traitors hathe confounded. To this, the kinge addes, Algarsif was missinge from supper, without cravinge parentes blissinge. this more encreasd Etheltaes indignation, to tax him att th'vndutifull boyes fasshion. but thoughe Cambuscans love his passion stayd, yet deemd hee, such ann absence ought bee wayd, specialie now, when Fregiley revolteth. thus the sadd twaine the matter long consulteth; his love yet lothd to turne it selfe to hate againste that statelie towne, which hee of late with so rare kerved workes had polished, highe sumptuous towres and trophies garnished, that trulie to distroy't on iuste occasion, woold forage hates hart, for loves emulation. Thus vengeance, ire, love, lodginge in one nest, spent till a snuff the nightes lampe without rest, till morpheus ebon mace, ytipd with lead, had spred his sable curtaine o're theire head. But ear sonn sett, Canacies lookinge glasse had to her glassd from farr the verie case, Which shee beholdinge, from her closet rose, and, weepinge, quicklie to her parentes goes: 'fore whome, on knees, shee sayd, her hap was bad to bee the bringer still of newes vnglad. ‚ÄúWhie so?‚Äù (quoth they) ‚Äútell yt vs daughter deere, thoughe badd newes, rifer bin, then good to heere.‚Äù ‚ÄúPardon my brother, pardon √¥,‚Äù shee sayde: ‚Äúmy brother Algarsife (I feare) betrayd, whome the Fregiliens have gott in their handes, and him have captive made vnder their bandes.‚Äù ‚ÄúCaptive! nay Captaine,‚Äù (quoth the queene) ‚Äúthem o're‚Äù so rowsinge her, vowd hee shoold dye thearefore; ‚Äúfalse caitiff, traitor! thy stolne liberties, thy pleasures vnrestraind, thy surquedries, thy gracinge publicke ill, good in private, thy surphetes, luxuries, plottinges in state, weare presages enuff, what thow wooldst bee, but, as thow art, thow doest, so comm to thee.‚Äù This while, Canace melted into teares, for brothers faultes, which weare no faultes of hers, and while shee pittie beggd for fathers love, noold from Cambuscan once her eies remove. Who (good kinge) felt more bruntes by this vprore then yet in wisdomm hee ment to explore. his Queenes revenge, his daughters mercie suite, his sonns falshode, his owne truithes condispute, his love and iustice, falshode to exile, and serve all turnes, woold crave some longer while. more sayd hee not, sith tim's now t'mend all harmes, and thearefore rowzd him vp, to goe to armes. Tho sadd Lord Phebus, in a drippinge morne, peepd through his tawnie lockes (forespellinge storme), and rufflinge auster made all clowdes one clowd, to dight a mantl', him gainste the raine to shrowd. Now Canac havinge oportunitie of time, place, grace (devoide of companye), besought her parentes leave t'affoord her speeche: they, givinge Lovinge Leave to her beeseeche. ‚ÄúIt yrckes my verie soule and hart‚Äù (quoth shee), ‚Äúposethe my wittes and iudgmentes depth, to see, that suche a divelishe witche, flinger of trickes, shoold exercise on vs her slye magickes, orelooke our cattell, and infect all thinges; distort their bodies, and theire limbes round wringes; wrest the streight crooked, the right eyes besquint; poison the spirites, theire sinewes wreath and stint; thrust ouglie fowle shapes on the fairest stature; blowe opposition twixt nature and nature; the matter stupifie, of youths gen'ration; counterfeate, yet ne cann vse copulation; traduce the witt, from own witt, to her will, by charmes obsequious, till them selves they kill; with good commix badd, imbibd willingelie, till frend to frend, turne mortal enimye; demolishe all thinges, as spites spoliator, in spite off (yet suffred by) their creator; in natures sicke distempers, the slye dealer, that to gaine credite, stealer plaies and healer. my Lord, her drugges weare yet withstoode by no man, for malice hathe no bottomm in a woman.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat? what? pray whose that?‚Äù (quoth the kinge &amp; queene), for her discourse gann to them pleasant seeme, in that theire daughter, a great secret telles, of radicke witchcraft, and of horrid spelles. ‚Äúsaye on, Canac‚Äù (quoth they), ‚Äúwhoe is this beast? or wheare keepes th'ellcatt, dares all these infest?‚Äù ‚ÄúGood Lord, tis false Viderea‚Äù (quoth Canac), ‚Äúa bewteous ladie once, and rich of grace, sithe theldest daughter of lord Homnibone, baron bold abrode, and kind at home: whoe, for his prowesse and magnificence, with hospitalitie of most dispense, was honord throughe the world, bothe farr &amp; nye, as great grandfather of all faire chivalrie. his court a schoole was, bothe of artes and armes, whither, whoe so complaind of wronges or harmes had to theire cause a noble knight assignd, which shoold theire wronges right, &amp; beat tirantes blind: accordinge to that brave societie of nobliste Artur of old Faerie, whoe fetcht from thence his verie president of love, iustizd by truith magnificent. This false Videria, prienge into state, and, through a false glasse, dressinge her elate, Which glasse (it seemd) was caste in Alchymie, to amplifye thinges to monstrositie, fell to selfe likinge, which sh' admird in that shee sawe, how in her selfe to factitate, and proiectes to begett of greatest great; wheare, deeminge eminence the iolliest seat, that, turninge courtier, woold protest as trewe for falshode, cann make purchase by the shewe. her pride and avarice (not yet content) blasond her exemplars (her mindes casement), that all eares woold, and eies her partes admire, meaninge (in deede) but to alluer folke nye her, whome, with sweete blandishmentes, shee deignd regreete (as the caracter of ann hipochreete): for it is all daie seene, whoe sittes at gaze, had rather to bee caught, then catch by th' blaze.

Wheare, downe hee raught the bridle, which his frend, kinge Thotobon of Arab≈ì and Ind, had sent him, with a swoord and horse of brasse, which trye hee will in this disastrous case. plaine was the bridle, of well tand leather hunger, buckled, to lett longe, short, not o're or vnder; the bitt, a canon bytt, of won stuff, able to tame the wildest colt in proff; howbeet so pleasaunt, after some while worne, as with glad cheere and ease mote well bee borne; Which held the curb, or water chaine so nye, as coold checke stumblinge, and teach remedye. from whence they ventred to the mantled greene, wheare Ph≈ìbus woold have Canac gladder seene, out of her murninge weedes: but murners lawes affoorde no mirth duringe the murninge cause. They had not oftenn measured the plaine (powncd with white deisies, died with flowrs in graine, checkred with primrose, dyed with cowslips mild, strewd with blewe violetes, amilinge the feild); but as theire eies the lantskipps viewe weare fetchinge, iust with th'orisons furthest clowdes out stretchinge, behold, amidd the aier, the brazen horse came in his mayne carryer, of sourse deorse, rougher then Neptunes wildcolt-fominge waves, when all the sandes and sowndes with frothe hee laves: that wonder was to see him sore so hye, not havinge Pegasus his winges to flye; as wondrous to expect his then repaire, havinge so longe a time binn weft and straier. the reason was Cambuscans privie call (secretlie whispred to th' etherial), had first, as swift as thought, flown to the stead, which heard, hee comms, the world mote not forbead. Cambuscan tho, so rounded in his eare, as still hee standes, not offringe muche to steare; like as of old, when wise Pithagoras sawe a wild oxe devoure the corne or grasse, gann virtuous wordes so round into his eare, as foorthwith gann the lowlie beast forbeare, yea, wox tame, and went vp and down the streate, nor once woold eate, but what men gave to eate; so stoode this brasen horse as still as stone, till kinge Cambuscan gann the bridel done, and clombe his backe, as light as bucke or doe; but then the horse gann startel, tripp, and goe, curved, carrier, bound, rear, rebound, and daunce, obayenge yet the bridelles observaunce. Tho bode hee Canac gett vp him behind. shee did so, fearinge nought hee t' her assignd, so confident of him was Canace, as shee durst walke with him vppon the sea. Whome, vp and setled, bides sitt close and fast, holdinge by him, and bee of nought agast. Meane while the kinge said, ‚Äúhollo, hollo, boye,‚Äù shee wondrous gladd to feele the stead obaye. ‚ÄúBut now, my gearle,‚Äù Cambuscan said to her, ‚Äúlooke to thy selfe:‚Äù the rodd then made him sterr, the kinge him bearinge faire &amp; streight in seate, for better knight no age did ear begeate, wheather it weare on horsebacke or on foote, hee vsd to putt his horse and him selfe toot. first, easelie trottes, endlonge, all the greene, liftinge his pasternes (goodlie to bee seene), with suche a countenance as gave to knowe, the kinge had to commaund the beast to bowe; then gallops out, then makes a soddaine stopp, then fortie foote into the ringe hee lopp. the people howtinge, ‚Äúoh, most gallant horse.‚Äù for whie? hee had not tried on them his force, and theare in mayne carrier, he trode th'essaye that simbolizeth trew loves rundelaye: whence, crossewise, viers twoe roundes, like eightes bi figure, trew lovers simbole gemelized one creature. When hee had donn all smooth trickes on the ground, hee tooke the paralel, neighbringe the round, wheare in hee trottes, vnto the pathes farr ende, but theare, on thinder heeles, turnes to rewend: thence retrottes tailewise backwardes, whence he cam to charge foreright, as dothe a busshinge ram. Thus havinge founde his horse at plaine worke readye, hee warnd Canac, aye to sitt fast and steadye. tho, with the rodd and spurr, th'orse rose alofte, twentie curveddes before, behind as ofte, that never horse was known comm off so hye, which seene, ‚ÄúGod save Canac!‚Äù all people out crye. ‚ÄúHarcke‚Äù (quoth the kinge), ‚Äúthese praie for thee, with cries, Yet bin thy most malitious enimies.‚Äù tho (with a trice), Cambuscan trilld the Jyn that in his horses ear movd with a pinn, and whispred secretlie, a word or twaine: th'orse boltes vp right in th'aier, and left the mayne. The people, it seeinge, soone awaye rann all, fearinge the beast woold on their heades down fall. but soone the stead sord highe and out of sight, leavinge them weepinge, in a mazefull plight. some sighd for their good kinge, some for his daughter; others wisshd they mote ride awaye soone after. some wondred how Canac (so towzd and tosst) coold keepe her seate, and sitt her horse so fast. some said, ‚ÄúIf they had suche ann horse, be bould to heavn with ease, when so them liste, they would.‚Äù some fell to counsell, ‚ÄúWhoe shoold be their kinge?‚Äù others said, ‚Äúnone, but Ethelta the Queene.‚Äù some dreamd of chaunge, some of succession prate, others weare sicke, till they had taxt the state. some thought it best to chouse annother kinge; others thought twoe too muche, wheare one did wringe. some mockd at somme, for state-mongers absurd, till scarce one of them all had one wise word. Now, when the kinge had brought vnder her eye all regions, nations, kingdoms, farr and nye, hee bore vp, till her head was in the sonn; whence (with a trice) her feete weare in the moone; thence, downehill, softlie homewardes bore againe, and in his daughters handes hee placd the raigne, teachinge and helpinge how to rule his steade, by a discreete hand, borne vppon his head; for twas his purpose, glorie, ioye, and glee that shee should ride his horse as well as hee. and theare belowe hee shewd her all thats donn, publicke, and privatelie, vnder the sonn; in states, courtes, counselles, benches, consistories, schooles, vniuersities, celles, oratories, faires, marketes, burses, shopps, heades, hartes, handes too, in closetes, studies, chambers, wheare men doe all policies of them, which factitate all stratagems of them who machinate, a wondrous thinge to see, which I note tell, vnlesse Canacies glasse stoode centinell. But when the people him cominge home discried, capps, cries, and friskalles, to the welkin hyed. Naie, when they sawe Canac comm well againe, no ground, no reason, mote theire tonges containe, for they which late woold have annother kinge, now, none but hee, theire common songe dothe singe: now, for Canacies Love they woold runn madd, though of Algarsifs revolt they weare gladd. some said, ‚Äú√¥, whoe noold ioye in suche a kinge? Love, honor, and obaie all his offspringe? so trew, iust, valient, wise, meeke, debonaire! good god continewe them!‚Äù was all theire praier: yet these binn th'arpeies of the droopinge time, that all at nouum settes, on fyve or nyne. By this the kinge came prawncinge o're y plaine, Canac, his daughter, holdinge well the raigne, whome theare hee made right perfect in the skilles of ridinge goiles, plaines, ruffetes, dales, and hills, and to comm off and on, turne and returne, and In him anie wheare, shee liste soiorne. so taught her how to trill the pinn in th'eare, which th'horse, at willes quicke call, heard anie wheare, all which the people sawe, with mickle ioye, so neere the court gates nimblie lighted they, and drewe the bitt, which in thighe towr they layd, till, cominge foorthe, it bee of all obayd. The kinge gonn home; theare stoode the brazen horse, not to bee movd by all the peoples force, no, thoughe they gazd &amp; shovd, b'yond all decision, calles gladlie, what they knewe not, superstition. Tho titan pursd vp all his somms of coyne emploid at vsurie, in bancke, or moyne, and lockd his golden rayes in thazure cheste, convoid by torche and candel light to weste, dismissinge eglet scyntills on the flowres, which causd the gardins blusshe of silver showres. the leathern batt, shades hawnter, lothinge light, strooke in: all takinge leave to bidd good night. Canto quinto. The vulgar much desireth warr; Algarsife it apologizethe; Cambuscan callethe Akafir; Canac th'armie to love advisethe. Before the weepinge gearles, Pleiades, had leapt th' orison, to the brinishe seas, a post gallopinge, whoe by starr light rann, knockd at court gates; the porter quicklie camm, and speedinge vp the packett to the kinge, for newes was all the peoples questioninge, whoe, since the late rebellious practisinge, made of Algarsife, but tantologinge; for none but descanteth vppon his action, which, at theire litle ears, enlargeth faction, theventes wheareof not one but dares divine, and officers vnto the campe assigne, and looke what newes the post hathe not to tell, they dare supplie, and to the world revell, vntill so many truithes binn out at once as hathe our Ladie new begotten sonnes. ‚ÄúNow, now,‚Äù vauntes one, ‚Äúpackes idlnes awaye, and now tall men who lacke shall lacke no pay, but leave base seekinge dinners, at each table, which, to vs soldiers, writes dishonorable; ne wayt at court, for court smoke, elles in vaine, without our salaries, a yeere or twaine; ne care to gage Jackes leathern panche by oures, with lookinge bigg on all that on vs lowres; ne princke our outsides fasshion with new suites, while purses insides pennilesse disputes.‚Äù ‚ÄúNaye, now the world will mende, so wee may winn, elles, goe the Divl' withall,‚Äù quoth Tomallin. for so the vulgar rable prophecie, as if theire warrs woold all folkes wantes supplye, whearefore, th'vnrulie wisshe for hopefull warrs, till feelingelie they bringe home curelesse skarrs; and so they ianglen, wheare they herd togeather, opinions, for opinions, chouse yee wheather, that never are vnfurnishd of this fasshion, to hold with either partie contestation. The packett opened, and the letter seene, the kinge impartes his newes vnto the queene, how that, besides, theire wicked sonn's gonn out, ‚Äúthe man at Fregiley bears all the rowt, plaies Captaine General of all disorders, and calles vnto his partie all the borders, specialie those hee holdes to him most nye, whoe gainste vs have donn greatest villany, buildinge most saftie vppon theire defense, who have to aunswer for the like offense. √¥, but o're them beares the most ielleous eye, whoe standes not vnto vs, most contrarie. Now wheare the Prince praetendes his iuste defense, his folke will challenge armes of false offense, sithe, sooner dothe a false truith bleare their eies as they woold (by suspition) seeme most wise; yet groundinge all theire chiefest confidence on the possessd greatnes of theire owne prince, whence anglers, (whoe woold rise by emulation) and of theire service publishe demonstration; fightes, railes, skoldes, writes against vs all they may, their syde to bolden, our right to dissmaye; theareby t'imbarcke them in the peoples hart, which still consisteth of theire maior part; and, for suche sharkinge paines, lookes at his handes to reape (besides his grace) our farmes and landes; concludinge on this groundes securitie falselie gott, nis kept, but by falsitie. ‚ÄúAmongst his other stratagems well known, hee ann apologie abrode hathe strowen, that, to the world, propoundes the causes whie hee's forced by armes to gard his Libertie, and vauntes hee note bee otherwise secure, vnlesse in Fregiley hee him immure; besides, that I, his father, without right, have offred all my kingdom to that knight, which shall Canacy winn, at Serra towne, so (in effect) shee bears thence the renowne: ‚ÄòBut I, that am his eldest and first borne, shall have the nesteltrett sett mee beforne, so shoold I rest, at her choice and discretion, and live enthralld at her meere manumission. Then, whearfore, serves the lawe of blood or nations? if theldest birth, of natures propagations, shoold at a ffathers pleasure, or displeasure, suffer of dewe inheritance disseasure? and, pray, what comfort ist to live in feare of him, or her, that plottes to bee ons heire? by reason, thearfore, and meere natures lesson, I keepe in Fregiley my owne possession, hopinge the world will so interpret it as fyttinge reasons right, and a good witt: touchinge my frendes, I doubt not to bee able, to pleasure them, as they stand pleasurable. Algarsife.‚Äô‚Äù The Queene, a princesse of that maiestie, and resolution gainst extremitie, as all the world not suche annother had, heard out, with courage, bothe the good and badd, and, (thoughe a woman) yet none tooke this from her, shee did abound in all masculine honor. ffirst to her deerest husband thus bespake, ‚Äúmost lovinge, valient, and heroicke make, this rule of nature, which to mee is dewe (if I bee not deceavd), extendes to you, that in her bookes of love I never read, to bringe my cradle on my proper head: which natural love hathe a love of owne that bindes b'owne lawe all that of her are grown to filial dutie, Which (of natures kind) creepes out at birth, concrete, into one mind, wheareby ites younger hath t'orerule ites elder, as reason knowes, wheare reason is the welder. Now wheare my birthe dares reasonlesse elate, as sensual vsurpers them sufflate, it is a canon in our lawe of reason, suche insolentes bin guiltie of highe treason. and by that canon all which goe that gate, bin well pronounced, natures degenerate; and those whoe iustifie suche false escapes, perseverance swears to bee our reprobates. for, if in truith and iustice him wee gott, and hee doe neither, is hee ours or not? But heere I find it trewe (as Canac sayd), how gladlie hee Videriaes plottes obayd, in havinge from her hellishe pollecie suckd state praetenses for his monarchie: wheareto the boy pretendes wee wrongd his right: L√¥, false-truith is his popular anglinge slight. which false truith, and false iustice, weighes ye sleightes, which falsaries traduce, t'annoint their baytes, which, on stoln greatnes, plottes to coyne it so, as no inferior dares inquire to kno. But now hee pleades, forsooth, hee's forcd to armes, L√¥, heere are more of false Videriaes charmes! sir, whie? forsoothe, for pocket libertie; but wheare? in mutinous false Fregiley. and whome woold hee preclude, or stripp heerebye? ev'n her whoe, for his sake, dothe all daye dye, evn poore Canac, (his sister) whose wett eyes, wrunge handes, kind hart, head carefull, pitteous cries, knockes night and day at our ears in his favor; yet this vile viper killes her for her labor. and whie? forsoothe, shees but the nesteltrett, and hee'l be iudge whome wee shall foremost sett. √¥, hee's first borne; he thearefore will inheritt, so vauntes, lawe of blood dothe on him conferr it. and hee's first male, so theritage is his, first comm, first servd, is iuris apicis. But wee have longe since cutt off all entaile from tainted blood, whence no blood cann prevaile. elles should the first borne-male for aye inherite, no barr could lye gainste anie wicked spirit. for so mote all prime-nates precedence claime, earth, water, laye, priest, fleshe, ore reason raigne; onlie our selves knowe wheare the secret lies, of secondes o're prime-nates predignities. But the proud boy begges praise vppon his witt; hoh, glorious eloquence, without creditt! surelie theare are whoe makes their witt the prize, that wittelie bringes home owne tragedies. naie, hee provokes foorth reas'n as of owne right; as if iustice his nurses had t'acquight, and so it hathe; but not suche as hee meanes, which yet near had but love twixt twoe extreames. Lastlie, this peltinge orator proclaimes bribes to all suche as with his side retaines evn pleasure (as they pleasurablie standes): a glorious fetch, t'allure in troopes and bandes, which petulantlie subrogates to sense the Seminar≈ì of stale indulgence. a speedinge traine, whearewith the most are caught, Younge, old, male, female, and brought backe to naught. whearfore, deere husband, as our honors liefe is setto sale by this lewd Algarsife, to armes with speede; march gainste this raskall boye, and never turne vntill his lives distroye. it yerkes mee, that I bore the recreant; whearfore let iustice all his quarters haunt, because he deignes Videria false t'obaye, (obedience makinge service, wise men saye) whence as hee serves, and ioines t' our enimye, (which mortalie waylaies our familye) so live, so dye hee (to vs contrarie), ever remembred of damnd infamie. Ethelta.‚Äù The queen theare made full point. then thus y kinge: ‚Äúsweete Ethel, as I lent you listeninge, so, lovelie love, and by our mutual love, tell mee if ought this scandale may remove, the blemishe salvd (cause of your sadd complaint) that hath our house with infamie attaint?‚Äù ‚ÄúNone‚Äù (quoth the queene), ‚Äúfor shame so dieplie stainethe, as nothinge cures it while the cause remayneth. nor suche a faitor cann I breath or brooke, who hathe his treasons learnt so t' blanche by booke, as dares terme false trewe, trew false (surquedrye), and all annoint with th' name of libertie; whence never traitor yet presumd to rise, but in false truithes, and liberties disguize. whearefore, deere husband, now denye mee not, hatinge the cause, I will revenge the blott.‚Äù ‚ÄúNay then‚Äù (quoth hee), ‚ÄúIf no remedie bee, I will to armes, as all the world shall see. quiet your selfe a while, my owne sweete hart, while I play a knightes, husbandes, fathers part.‚Äù Tho sange ann earlie crowe, from topp of tree, longe dismal notes, the weather wett woold bee, while glistringe Ph≈ìbus (noddinge beetl browd) peepd waterishlie through a dim-mantled clowd, yet flunge his dartes at the mornes crevicies, that all whoe busines had, mote see to ryse. Ear this Canac, whose vse was, night &amp; day to be last vp, and first in her araye, thought on her gentil falcon, sicke and sore, which pacient shee deignes carefullie deplore; on whome (throughe her ringes vertewe, as was sayd), out plaisters, and in cordiales, ofte shee layd, and gave, withall, constant encouragement, as best befittes wheare th' vital spirites are spent. while the meeke Falcon, languishinge in mewe, beheld farr off, when all the skies weare blewe, how her false tarcelet gann her much abuse, in makinge th' woodes and hills his common stewes; nay, looke what linnen, naprie, panch, or gutt, cast to the dung hill, or on hedges putt, this carrion kyte could find abrode or gett, bothe her and it gives to the Tercelet. which causd the Falcon pine and melt with greefe, as dothe Canac, for her false Algarsife, Whose conferrencies presentlie mote stay, sithe mars his trumpet calles vs all awaye. By this time had mavortial Cambuscan wrote manie breves, whearwith swift Postes out rann, to everie coast and stowt-sea-bordringe towne; and t' all Commaunders, sworne trewe to his crowne, to see all Armories furbushd with speede, and bee in readines at instant neede. One letter was to Akafir directed, with large commission, as to one selected, to bee of all the Seaes highe Admiral, sith 'gainst th' kinges foes he formoste chargd of all, and with stowt swoord alone fell on the troope, which resolutelie hee forcd, gardeloope. this the kinge notinge, and for services, him fittest cleapd commaunder on his seas. This knight foorthwith bod calcke and rigg all shipps. With tallowe, boild pitch, okeham, tarr beclipps, with cables, ancors, tackle, mastes, irn, sailes (in leakes, losse, tempestes, store of these prevailes); with canons, powder, crosse barrs, round shott, pikes, bills, muskettes, holberdes, ope and closelie strikes, with bowes and arroes, headded with wild fyer, with chaine shott, fierworkes, from the Gunners tyer, with ladles, chargers, skowrers, carthridges, with lint stockes, coolers, when oreheates encrease; With swoordes and targettes, head peece, forecurates without backe steele plates, for none backe retrates; with stronge wrought furnitures and victuales store, sith, out at sea, cann begg at no mans dore. Of these a muster general is made, of mariners and gallantes of warr trade, 'mongst which the voluntaries weare praeferrd before those whoe ne but for pressure sterrd; and out of those th' ighe Admiral electeth provident pilates, whoe the fleete directeth, that knowes to shunn flattes, shelfes, sandes, rockes, and daungers, and as well all home creekes as coastes of straungers, and how at last to bringe home peace and rest in the safe hauon, wheare to arive is blest. All these in soldiers cotes, of redd on white, darraignd a brave and gallant manlie sight, of lustie bodies nimblie condisposd, to seeke out action (as their lookes disclo[s]d). In whose all praesence th' Admiral displaies Cambuscans colors, th' ensigne of th' essaies, whose embleam everie soldier knewe before, yet Akafir it vauncd, with brave decore, and told them all, th' are bounde to make it good, for so the kinge will, thoughe with losse of blood. They swore the would; then, as like minded frendes, th' Admirals briefe oration thus intendes that all men, the next tide, must bee aboord, on paine of death, as martial lawe afoord. then each shipp shall sett saile, and followe him, to Cape mor dieu, in Faerie land, to winn; but if roughe stormes or mistes, at sea them seaver, beare vp t' fortie Degrees to meete togeather. that sayd, hee ore each shipp a pilote gave, with other officers of good behave, providinge that th' kinges colors and emblem wave, all alofte, the mayne-mastes-highest stem. Thus drawes th'owr now that th'whole fleete must depart, mayne yardes vp hoisd, crosse sailes hunge all a thwart, ancors at copstone, readie to bee wayd, masters and boteswaines-whistelles lowdlie brayd, whence to depart, dothe quicklie chaunge the cheere, as well of land frendes as the marinere: but frendes for frendes, and lovers for their lovers, gann sighe, parentes for sonns, sisters for brothers, betakinge all to god, wishe mirry meetinge, the woomens last farewell (endinge in weepinge) bewraies, althoughe the land puttes off the seas, yet better concordance woold better please. Thus gonn are they to sea, wheare Akafir soone publishd the strict Discipline of warr, which first iniones obedience and respect, to all Commaunders (officers elect), specialie to dewe services divine, forbiddinge othes, lies, quaffes of beere and wine, treasons and brawles, not pardond, doth repeale (hard taske and straunge); no mariner shoold steale. In the meane time, couragious Camball drewe into the feild thold garrisones and newe, wheareof hee viewes to muster yonge and old, and of them soone observes the spirites moste bold, sayenge, ‚Äúmy hartes, wee'l ride out calme &amp; storme, and fight the game out till the last man borne.‚Äù those whoe replied in silence with a smile, hee valued best, and ranckd them in his fyle. Cambuscans selfe was the chiefe General, but men did Camball lord Liuetenant call. whoe soone drewe th' armie into battailes three, to march thone fore annother in degree: first th' vantgard, midle next, and last the Reare, as youthe, manhode, grave age, succession beare. and wheare the first twaine rashelie chaunce to fight, the wisest, last, should theire disorders right. Then in Cambuscan spurrd, vpon Ducello, (his brazen horse) feircer then Neptunes billo, whose dauncinge plumes, topp of his armors shine, seemd at the sonns beames many sonns t'entyne: with bevers casement ope, which told each eye, that theare within dwelt roial maiestie; and by his syde his swoord Morliuo wore; his right hand a directinge warder bore.

Whence they whoe woold Algarsife killd wileare, noold kill him now, but take him prisonere; and give him to his ffather for correction, to doe with him and them at his election. Cambuscan likd all well his daughter did, Yet weetelie in his countenance it hid. Howbeet, Queene Ethelta for iustice cried; but Canac, ‚Äúpittie, pittye,‚Äù still replied. the mother from the daughter differinge: this, sterne and hott; that, meeke as water springe. so that betweene the twaine the motives weare vrgd so patheticklie, by her and here, as th'oste distracted was with ire and woe, knowinge, but as they felt their life blood goe, t'encline to this or that; ffor suche deplore was in theire confines never heard afore; yet faine woold yeeld contentment vnto bothe, as either in them inwardlie was lothe, none yet felt whoe had, whoe had not, denial, till future conflict brought the case to trial.

Canto Sexto. Cambuscan goes to th' feild and leaves Canac and Serra vnder Ethel's care, shee Camball blissd; but Canac streaves, with her in Love: the soules state they declare. Chaunticleere, the sadd nightes horaloger, vp thrilld the poize that his clockes watch gann sterr, to number and dispart black time by howres, which hee to th' wide world with ope mowth distowres, while snugginge they in cabbins laye each one, Flegme beinge yet in domination; onlie Cambuscan and stowt Camballo ofte rose to serch if thoste watcht well or no. and tooke it into owne officious cure, that greater charge hathe greater taske t'endure. But winged time, which never sleepes ne staies to bringe the destinies onwardes their waies, calld vp the lowringe sonn in ruddie morne, which promisd raigne ear night or flatuous storme, so clomb the humid Crabb, all vernishinge with florent bewties of the wanton springe, in Joues exaltate court, wheare best beesemis Floraes freshe bowres, weare all that sweet and greene is on thin stalkes, danglinge white, redd, yello, blewe, trees in large liveries blusshinge blossoms newe, dewd with pearld eglettes, openinge finest pores, in roote, rind, leafe, flower, riche of amber stores, which fertil zephirs velvet spirit bloweth, no subtile eye dicerninge how it groweth; yet ioienge their liefes poesies of the time, richelie perfumd with coolinge eglentine. Now though the rathe had her bare leafe and grasse, and thearefore hard and skant for hostes to passe, till Ceres ripened had her mellowe graine that well mote tharmies foragers sustaine. Cambuscan yet, t'advaunce his expedition, held all times equal on equal condition. but heere betwixt him and his enimies, conditions like did not alike arise, sithe they binn furnishd of last yeers provision, which this yeere shoold rest at his prohibition. ‚Äúwhearefore‚Äù (quoth hee), ‚Äúwellcomm redd mars his feild; but pleasures, home sportes, ease, stand yee exild; and wellcom leager, wheare harshe soldierie hathe to make vertewe of necessitie. ne bee it ever sayd I so lovd life, as kinglie virtue durst not cope with strife; Weare armor, daungers runn for such a wife, and, for the boies sake, fetch in Algarsife; ne let posteritie vaunt he had Love, whome zeale to truith and iustice could not move.‚Äù ffrom this discourse the trumpetes bootie cella sommond Cambuscan soone to leave his pilla, for thundringe Drums calld hastelie to th' feild all glistringe steele cotes, pikes, shott, speare, and sheild, whome bold Camballo marshelld to attende his roial ffathers pleasure, staie or wend; whoe soone came armd in bright enchaced steele, from the gold caske downe to the silverne heele, blasinge his owne cote amor on his brest; highe mounted on Ducello, goodlie beast, that wonder was to see, great Cambuscan, fore whome Love, honor, reverence, quicklie rann. Hee theare foorthwith committed to the Queene the cittie Serra with ites large confine, from sea to sea, to rest at her direction, with's daughter Canac, vnder her protection, to counsell, gard, and watch in his absence, in exercise, without soft indulgence, ‚Äúne suffringe tharroe heades of meltinge lust T'affix in yee the skarrs of direfull rust; hopinge yee will doe all your mother willeth,‚Äù so well to doe her will his will fulfilleth. Obedient Canac, yeeldinge thearevnto, admittes, what nature liste not, Love cann doe. Besides, hee tooke strict order instantlie, that all the landes highe beakens, farr and nye, as well the promontories neere the seaes, which have to sende theire foresight backe to these, shoold, with all speede, bee well reedifyed, and with gardes faithfull and good watche supplied, and all thold Garrisons to bee reviewd, and with younge able-bodies bee neuewd; his loiall subiectes, younge, old, midle, and all traind soldiers, to bee at ann howers call; his armies to supplye, or home defend, as forane or home accidentes bin kennd, tendringe them theire stowt ffathers discipline, ‚Äúwhich best keepes Faerie Lande still youres, and myne.‚Äù So tooke hee order how his campe and shipps shoold bee revictualld, ear them starcnes nipps, b' entreatinge Manor Lordes, folkes lesse to fli?e, commons renlarge, restore thold colonies, acornes resowe, ear wracke or common lacke, wears to depart, lett natures ffrye goe backe. post horse he laid at everie fittinge stade, for swift intelligence (states vade invade), ne woold hee anie faction leave behind slye snake, in whome was never love to find. Thus stoode they readie ranckd in martial viewe, by it was daye, to march to Vill Perdieu; Camballo takinge leave of's mother queene in filial dutie, as mote well beseeme. Whome shee commaundes, by the powr of a mother, to right her wronges on his false vniuste brother, whoe grones (shee sayd) for iustice to bee donn, but him shee wills doe, like his ffathers sonn, trulie and iustelie, which is valientlie, but not so to attchive, biddes rather die, sithe everie action that trewe iustice wantes is onlie proper to vile miscreantes: ‚Äúbut never leese thy right through fraud or feare, for so woold never valient conquerere;‚Äù and sithe his ffather a commaunder makes him, example t' all the world best demonstrates him, yet so as, vnder him, all doe no lesse, not lightlie pardoninge any that transgresse. Hee sayd hee woold. And so the mothers blissinge vp tooke him from his knees with teers and kissinge, sayenge, ‚ÄúGod blesse thee, boye! by vertue rise, and on trewe honors winges surmount the skies!‚Äù The campe heard this, &amp; much admird y queene, sweringe shee is not as fond mothers been, whose blind indulgent eies are apt to see owne childrens faultes as if all vertews bee. Nextlie, the kinge and Queene, with sadder eye then whilome wonted, viewd each mutualie, for now the thought of partinge did promote a lothe depart, in silent lovers note. But part they muste; She craves, and hee obaies: Lovers, by lovers lawes, have no gainesayes. yet how the iust and trewe brooke separation wheare never laye, nor ever shall, mutation, iudge lovers trewe, whoe iustlie lovd and love yet, wheather it now bee pittifull to prove it. but trew and iust can never so depart but that their eithers love hathe eithers hart; but how love maie from iustice part, woold aske, trial vppon allmost as hard a taske. ‚ÄúAdiew, my faithfull queene,‚Äù Cambuscan sedd; ‚Äúto deale now for your man I foorth am spedd.‚Äù But at that word ‚Äúfor,‚Äù teers of irefull ire fell from her eies, as syntilles flintinge fyer; ‚Äúfor?‚Äù (quoth shee), ‚ÄúNaie, gainste that false-vniuste boye my vowes bin resolute, him to destroye: iuste are my vowes, my vowes and I bin one; Justice and I beare one communion; I am my selfe, and none cann take mee from her; so on that point of Justice restes my honor. the prime and end of thinges at me must enter, for iustice, of the worldes frame is the center; it is the capital essoine of all; for take thence Justice, and the world will fall. then husband, if heerein wee disagree, dishonor makes mee not at all to bee; but, lovinge mee, you love my iustice too, elles you saye one thinge, and annother doe.‚Äù On this hard sympathie Cambuscan stayd, yet, kindlie smilinge on her, thus he sayd: ‚Äúmost deere and lovinge wife, I kindlie yeeld; my love shall of your iustice bee the sheild, and I will doe you right, or I will dye; still yeeldinge, by loves right, t' your Justice hye. Yet so as wisdome, holdinge our loves rother, wee lovinglie and iustelie yeeld t' each other, which well may vaunce bothe youres and my designe, if wee bee not bothe angrie at one time.‚Äù This satisfied the glorious queene right well, and pleasd th' whole armie, ioyenge it to tell. but Canac could not but this processe feare, and after roundinge Camball in his eare, in hope to mollifie a soldiers hart, with tender pittie (Loves sweete woundinge dart), meeklie contested with her mother, sayeinge: ‚ÄúI (vnder protestation of obayenge) to you, deere mother, and your highe designes, doe begg most humblie, y' woold vouch safe my lines, and, on my knees (if possiblie it bee), if not for your Algarsife, yet for mee, forgive his life. If I live, lett him live, so may wee bothe live yf you him forgive.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo‚Äù (quoth the queene), ‚ÄúJustice muste first bee donn.‚Äù ‚Äú√¥ then‚Äù (sayd Canac), ‚Äúwheare is Loue becomm?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo‚Äù (quoth the queene), ‚ÄúJustice muste first bee served.‚Äù ‚Äú√¥ then‚Äù (sayd Canac), ‚Äúmercie wilbee sterved.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo‚Äù (quoth the queene), ‚ÄúJustice must first bee showen.‚Äù ‚Äú√¥ then‚Äù (sayd Canac), ‚Äúwheare is pitties throne?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo‚Äù (quoth the queene), ‚ÄúJustice betraide confoundeth.‚Äù ‚Äú√¥ then‚Äù (sayd Canac), ‚Äúhow ist grace aboundeth?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo‚Äù (quoth the queene), ‚ÄúJustice must highest raigne.‚Äù ‚Äú√¥ then‚Äù (said Canac), ‚Äúwhat maie favor gayne?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo‚Äù (quoth the queene), ‚ÄúJustice hathe no remission.‚Äù ‚Äú√¥ then‚Äù (sayd Canac), ‚Äúwhat is Zeales condition?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo‚Äù (quoth the queene), ‚ÄúLove dies, Justice provokd.‚Äù ‚Äú√¥ then‚Äù (sayd Canac), ‚Äúpromise is revokd.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo‚Äù (quoth the queene), ‚ÄúJustice wrongd loveth none.‚Äù ‚Äú√¥ yet‚Äù (said Canac), ‚Äúlett them ioine in one.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo‚Äù (quoth the queene), ‚ÄúJustice must b' satisfyed.‚Äù ‚Äú√¥ then‚Äù (sayd Canac), ‚Äúwee muste runn to hyde.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo‚Äù (quoth the queene), ‚ÄúJustice predominates.‚Äù ‚Äú√¥ yet‚Äù (said Canac), ‚ÄúLove more honorates.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo‚Äù (quoth the queene), ‚ÄúJustice must have her waye.‚Äù ‚Äú√¥ then‚Äù (sayd Canac), ‚ÄúPatience must obaye. if mercie, pittie, love, note Justice move, wellcomm sweete death that dies of hurtes love!‚Äù and tho shee wept, to water of the well, praienge her ffather otherwise to dell, in that her mother stoode so resolute, as litle waienge her dispute or suite. Wheareat th'whole host with pittie foorth was powred, while twixt them bothe the kinge stood, as devowred and muche distrained in his noble hart; whoe, takinge Canac by the hand apart, gave her the tenor of his mind in wrightinge, saienge, ‚ÄúI trust thee with ites faithfull keepinge, and so farewell, my lovelie daughter deere; bee in my absence my exequutere;‚Äù whome oft hee kissd. Then, turninge to the queene, hee tooke his leave, as noblie gann beeseeme, and prayd them bothe, that gainst his home repaire, they will see furnishd his new Theataier. Now at their partinge all the soldiers lowted, and to the queene, so lowd, and Canac, showted, as heaun and earth it seemd weare ioind togeather by truith, love, iustice, in this harshe dissever. the queene they reverencd, Canac lovd also; but wheather moste, was verie hard to sho. yet, commonlie, that suitor soner swaieth whose instant importunitie more praieth. the soldiers, cleapinge them bothe mistresses, had gott their colord skarfes in readines. Canacies colors, white, weare th' feild or ground, the Queenes blood redd, which still betokeneth wound; redd bendes on white, impaeld, as heraultes saye, meanes iustice hathe on innocence to swaye. Now bin the Queene and Canac faringe home, wheare the meeke Canac made t' her falcon mone; shee backe replienge, in her birdishe leaden, and Canac, by her virtuous ringe, it readen. So either t' either wailed each destanie, like fellowe sisters, of like miserie, which found some ease in vttringe eithers griefe: this of her tercelet, that of Algarsife; bothe drinckinge comfortes out of future hope, yet halsiond bothe hartes broke, if hope ne cope. Heere leave wee Canac, but not leave her idle, sithe bounde her handes apprentice to her needle; to wittnesse to it selfe, suche finger glorie annother daie mote gratifye her storie. Then all the soldiers, followinge the warrs, gave dewe attendaunce on their officers; a thowsand stowborne drums-tonitruous mad th' aiers affable vault redd mars his house, wheare suche ann vniuersal march declard as of all bodies framd one Corps du gard; seeminge a confusd-civile wildernes, ann heape disparted, ann huge ordered masse, a feild of loitringe woodes, straglinge behind, soone calld vp into one by discipline. a bee hive seekinge out, yet keepinge home, dares forane illes annoy, make good ites owne. a faire of leapinge coltes, or'e hedge and ditche, soone rendred, by strict reasons lore, none suche. a goodlie order of as martial men as ear arose gainste Titans glistringe bem, whoe kept one distance regular; in march ne doffinge armors, albeet sonns ray parch; for armes to have in warr, and still not vse yt, besides th' abuse, presumes as to refuse yt. The place, a goodlie champion to darraigne three hostes, consistinge of highe hilles and plaine, like th' ample lantskipps of old Amesburie, wheare mightie Arthur (flowr of chevalrie) by knightlie prowesse, in disposd battelles (t' old Olbions wellfare), heapes of Saxons quelles, deigninge them in those barrowes sepulture, to th' onor of his kind good swoord Mordure. Theare, theare, three squares of vibrant pikes out glides, ranckes after ranckes with muskettes on bothe sides, as winges to flye, to putt off and putt on the prime of schirmishe, till freshe secondes comm. each colors midd owne cohort in battaile, neerest the hart, furthest from foes assaile, best garded, with short weapons, holberdes, billes, swoordes, targettes, handie to defend neere illes. Trustie Binato lodd the first battaile, at whose well garded rear theare went in taile some light feild peeces, on wheele carriages, readie to doe theire masters services. The seconde-midle-mightie square battaile was by Cambuscans selfe lodd to assaile, and at his reare the great artillerie of Canons and demies, for batterie, on iron carriages, as huge as stronge, to tell and prove their masters minde ear longe. The third battaile, or Reare, Camballo ledd, which, as the former twaine, was discipled; in whose reare also weare some canons born, with bagg, baggage, munition, victual, corn. th' officers well directinge t' keepe good gard, all, in good order guided, onwardes faerd. The troopes of horse, before, behind, theare, heere, speculates all approches, farr and neere. but hee that this daie leades that battailes reare, tomorrowe in the vauntgardes place dothe steare; all three, by chaunginge turnes, of marchinge lawe, till bothe extreames into midle drawe. the reare Yet of as valient ones yledd, furnishd, trusted, honord, as th' vantgardes head. onlie the kinges owne standard, fore and hind, bore twoe gewles-cressletes, feild albe, in the wind. The vulgar, havinge gott t' ann higher place, to see this armies march, to their solace, twixt ioye and care, gann sadlie contemplate thus, and thus, as it fell into their pate. Some swore it was a goodlie slaverie, by fame, lawes, kinges, to seeke deathes braverye. Others sayd, sighinge, ‚ÄúAll these gallantes heere wilbee full cold in graves ear fyftie yeere.‚Äù Others esteemd them fooles whoe trott from home to gett annothers and to leese their own. Other some sayd, ‚ÄúMans whole liefe elles is nought then warrfare in all ages, to bee fought, and that, to leese this liefe for vertue, gaines a better liefe to recompence all paines.‚Äù Others held that this lives pleasures bin best, and fooles are they whoe hazard it in iest. Other some swore, that so to saye turn fooles, and offred to dispute the point in schooles. ‚Äúffor‚Äù (quoth one), ‚Äúthis lifes pleasures bin vnstable: Ergo, this whole lifes matter is moveable. but I that matter hold more honorable which in it selfe is firme, not permutable. but to bee mutable is not forever: Ergo, time cann this lives pleasures dissever. now then to hunt for what longe cannot last is (by your leave) a chaunce for fooles to cast. E contra, what all pleasures dothe containe is greater, so is pleasures soveraigne. reasn (or th' soules essence) is that same container Whome sense vsurpes, when will lettes sense distraine her: but not constraine her, for sense wantes that powr of rulinge or'e ites next superioure, but by consent, to sensative temptation reasn' her may yeeld, to discend b' immitation: howbee't may chouse of wise predignitie, inscribd in reasons superioritie. ffor reas'n, or willes materialitie, is th' essense it hathe of eternitie. elles nought it coulde of virtuous constancie, wear't not essentializd eternitie. then looke what once was of eternitie hath still to b' bove times continuitie. but this etern'ti's of th' first cause of causes:‚Äù so theare on that full point a while hee pawses. ‚ÄúNow, looke, what is of thigh'st eternitie officiates bove lifes mutabilitie. so, looke what's of eternal coessence ought consist of pleasures more excellence then th' momentanie-sens'tive. then tis cleere lifes pleasures-sensative doe chaunge each yeere. but th' soules pleasures, eternal bin, like her, fetcht fro th' first cause of causes: which t' averr is manifest, for reasonable thinges sucke from one higher-causinge-cause beinges. Then, as the first cause is all pleasures store, I sweare, th' eternal pleasures are much more then caduke-pleasures-sensative of life, for which fond men sett no boundes to their strife. But reasn' (wills moth'r) is of the highest hie; elles mote it near dispute, ne higher flye then the life sensative, which fades belowe. But reasn' ascendes above what sense maie knowe, ev'n bove th'earth, seas, aier, fier, moon, sonn, starrs, skye, (wheare everie thinge the soules reas'n hath to trye): yea, t' it first causinge cause-divine creator, for everie causd cause waites on ites first maker.‚Äù thus and thus people tatled, they ne wiste; nay, they will talke, lett wise men saye as liste. and surelie well it fell, they brake off so, sith oft they fall by th' ears before they goe. In the meane time th' whole armie, as it went, told too and fro the serious bickerment that twixt the Queene and meeke Canacy fell, which posd their iudgmentes to consider well of Justice sterne and kind Loves natures, ffor discordance hath t' make th' one thoth'r abhorr; ffor whoe woold thought but that innocent love mote som deale resolute Justice remove, and softenn yt, by th'importunitie of her owne daughter, begginge instantlie? ‚ÄúIn troth‚Äù (quoth they), ‚ÄúJustice is thinge most sterne, as from this schoone mote bold offenders learn: thoughe selfe love deeme it hathe with whites of eyes to bobb out Justice and her lawes foolize. as if rules weare no rules, ne givn to keepe, but mote bee pardond t' hipochrites, if weepe: for ravishd sighes, of fyrbal straines, of mone, vttred to gett leave to b' as badd anone; presuminge as if Justice weare vnwise, ne could of scopes or circumstantes devise, of whie? when? wheare? how oft the crimes weare donn? or wittingelie, naye willinglye, begunn? But wittinglie and willinglie been suche as iustice findes their endes, not differinge much.‚Äù Whence these bold soldiers (as they weare in raye) professd they woold evn so hold on theire waye, as not vniustelie tempt the queenes highe powr, ne thincke they mote with ease appease her lowr. So all agreed, till, marchinge, they weare bayd at a diepe foord, wheare for some time they stayd. and theare Cambuscan, lightinge from his stead, off drew the bridell from his brazen head, and wore it for a girdle bout his midle; it was his guize when rest gave leave to idle. Soone binn they quartered, cabbins made in haste; Campe and trench masters fortefies all faste. they goe to praier, and then prepare to meate (the coole eveninge requittinge the daies heate); calld is the watch, out skowtes, and gardes binn sett, while Camball of the General dothe fett the secret watchword, Paramoure, which hee impartes but to the gard (sworne trewe to bee). Tho, murninge Ph≈ìbus, robd in humid sable (Who, since these warrs, near lookd vp amiable), dismissd his coache and horses to the stable, n'is longer ope to hold his eyeliddes able; but dones the night capp of a russet clowd, which miste or raine of the next morne foreshowd. while lustie soldiers, for youthes exercise, rann, wrastled, iumpd, leapd, from a gluffes arise; some from ann halfe pike, and removd it twice. some tossd theire pikes, some stayd, some pushd a trice; some threwe the barr with th' arme, some with the foote; some flunge the maine stone, some to lifte fell toot, bothe to gett winde at will and masterie, and by muche vse, powrful dexteritie. activitie, breedinge agilitie, frolickes the witt, the spirittes multiplie, boldninge hott hartes, makes life blood swiftlie goe, when once these active doe owne forces kno. Campes mote of suche their modest concertation, practise a kind of virtuous emulation, selfe mendinge selfe, by so much the more able, as nerves by practise lustren serviceable; without grudge donn, or envious mutinie, which well ioines gainste the common enimye. L√¥ thus (in frendlie sort) these troopes contend, till th' watch biddes leave, goe rest, and make ann end. Canto Septimo. Algarsife rewes the stirrs that rose; the witch Videria turnes his mind; Camball and hee fought deadlie foes; Cambuscan, Akafir, the town inhemd. The wakefull larcke, whose madrigal gann vse to chaunt shrill laies ear daye, now dumps in muse, for Titan, the mornes melancholie murner, sadd, hevie, wilesse, mute, vncheerful iorner, noold luminate hills, dales, springes, medowes, woods, ne tyne with fierie beame the rapid floodes; ne wipe the cleere teeres off the leaves and grasse; ne sucke the mistes breath, to see others passe; ne visite his old frendes, whoe for him stayd; whearfore without him tharmie rose and rayd. Now false Algarsife, in great Fregiley, havinge begun a daungerous essay, a great proiect, a verie straunge designe, on which the world hold ope all ears and eyen, omitted nothinge, ne slept out his wittes, that to th'occasion opportunelie fittes. for hee, by th' witch Videriaes practises, kepte ofte intelligence with all places, which brought him everie secret donn, and sedd, in's ffathers counsell, chamber, closett, bedd, in court and campe, in countrie, cittye too, yet went his spies, as vsen frendes to doe, in complemental kind formes generous, well knowinge to vsurpe as virtuous. for, pray, what strength hath sex, what powr the wise, which openeth not to potent briberies? The newes are brought him, that his ffather coms gainste him with displayd Ensigne, trumpetes, drums, vengeance to wreake on his conspiracie, which his owne mother taxt at felonye. Algarsife at these tydinges chawes the cudd, for nature, natural, wrought in his blood, of kindlie kind, to thincke what hee hathe donn without forgettinge hee's his fathers sonn: for reasn' of propertie, owne good intendes, till sensual respect her eye-sight blendes; whence him withdrawinge to the drawinge chamber, but to bee further th'eeringe of each straunger, hee privatelie stole to a secret grove, and theare his lewd fact thus he gann reprove, for, certainlie, theare is no connivence hides reasons owne muse from owne conscience. Then thus Algarsif: ‚Äú√¥h, whome doest thow drawe on thine owne head, hart, reines, liver, and mawe? yea, on thyne honor; Naye, land, liefe, and all, more ore thie bloodes posteritie totall.‚Äù tho stoppd, sighd, blusshd, and further thus anon: ‚ÄúI my owne selfe have my owne selfe vndon. I have provokd my ffather and my mother; I have brought down againste mee my stowt brother; and, for my pleasures, vauncd my swoord gainste them, to th' slaunder of all sonns, and shame of men.‚Äù that sayd, deiectes him at a tree, and cried, as if his hart woold breake and theare have dyed. ‚ÄúAh, nature‚Äù (quoth hee), ‚Äúas th' ast mee forsaken, so in begettinge mee thow seemste mistaken. now mend thy faultes in thy owne workemanshipp, correct in mee thy blemisshes out slipp; vnmake my limbes, vntwiste my guiltie liefe, and quicklie spatche thy griefe-killd Algarsife.‚Äù tho sunge hee owne deathes dirgis with wett cheere, seeminge to bee owne murner, coffyn, beere. Thus did hee cruciate his soule with grieefe, as knowinge of ites authors hees one chiefe; for none is so disprivie to him selfe but knowes owne channell, thoughe he rann the shelfe. Yet of his litle virtue which remaines hee to his inmost reason recomplaines, and thus proiected in his agonie, humblinge: ‚ÄúI will repent this villanye, sithe to repent dothe dissaffect so farr, as cause to no cause nature dothe abhorr. sighinge, I will submitt mee to my ffather, and throwe my iuste death at his foote for favor; then, if hee kill mee for m' vntruithes mistake, perhaps hee 'l save his sonn for's ffathers sake. so stirr no further warrs, ne colles promove, then that his mercie have for subiect loue.‚Äù Thus doubt and sorrowe made him hott and drie (fitt fewell of dispaire, and apt to die), vntill hee sawe the water of a well whose draught was longer lifes, like faultes, fullfill. But l√¥, as hee was makinge this survaie, which gainste his best ffrendes treason did bewray, soddainlie the fregiliens rann to armes, and vp and down the streetes in heaps reswarms, throtinge it thus: ‚ÄúArme, arme, the viand comes!‚Äù tho quicklie to the walles all colors ronns, garded and wayted by th'whole companies of theire owne soldiers, troopinge with supplies; the cause was evident, ffor their skowt watche, which laye foorth the Cambuscanites to catche, weare well fought with and beate home to the town, all savinge them weare shortned by the crown; In so much that all the Fregiliens call ofte and againe for their Lorde General; meaninge in deede theire commaunder in chiefe, whoe then was absent, the Prince Algarsife. Hee, wheare hee bode, plaine heard thalarum bell, fro th' walles and watch towre these lowd newes foretell; which soddaine motion so entind his blood, as causd him aye rechawe his moodie cudd; for feirce commotions in youthes illious spirit needes litle helpe besides it selfe to fyer it, save companie (the humors torrent streame), which, least of any others, love the meane, thundringe: ‚ÄúWownes! blood! hoh!‚Äù whoe cann hold his handes from sweete revenge, if honor vnderstandes? L√¥ hee, now, whoe late woold him yeild t' his ffather, castes vppon doubtes, which tottringlie him waver: ‚Äúfor‚Äù (quoth hee), ‚Äúshould I offer my submission, I then muste accept of anie condition, as deathe, imprisonment, or bannishment, or stand confind, or tyed to decrement; or to suche inconveniences bounde, as liste the conquerers proiectes propound. so mote I leese that pleasinge libertie which sensivelie frolickes satietie. Againe, should I turne lesse now then to commaunder (beinge all readie one), woold bee my slaunder. but to leese commaund which I have allreadie, woold blase base cowardise and counsell giddie. for dothe not everie chiefe, which vnderstandes, make absolutenes the center of commaundes? and to commaund all absolutelie, as chieffe, doe they not willinglie runn all mischefe? yea, for that appetite of sole commaunder, brooke th' fatale pike of daunger and of slaunder? so, to my minde, nought correspondes more deere then to commaund, vncontrold b' any peere.‚Äù But hee too well knewe that no opposition coold growe, or bee, on indifferent condition. for whie? each selfe-same thinge, wee plainlie see, ne disconditionates, but dothe agree. Whence, wheare no difference lies: No concertation nor cause, ne matter is, for emulation. but emulation 'tis, wee see in sense, mote either winn or leese by discordence; and on suche discordance to conflate faction, to bee maintaind by wittes fytt for suche action. ‚Äúelles‚Äù (quoth hee) ‚ÄúI can neither keepe ne gett, if my plott with my ffathers bee iust mett; sithe no twoe-trewe-likes breedes repugnancies, because in them theare lies no contraries.‚Äù Videria, whoe laie close hidd in the grove, or'e heard and sawe how with him selfe he strove, steppd foorth and sayd: ‚ÄúAh, Prince Algarsife, flye, flye, t' offer but th' least cause of ielowsye to these Fregiliens, least yee bee vndon. Naie, rather (sithe the matter is begunn) vse resolution; prosequute the same which your apologie hathe vndertane. I meane that, wheare your ffather's trew &amp; iust, vouch you, your ffather's vntrewe and vniust, and that your selfe are onlie right, hee wronge; which right to keepe, say yee, ‚Äònow hither thronge;‚Äô ne suffer Camball ne Canac to gett what (by the Lawe of Discent) is your debt. But truith and iustice must bee your praetense, to gaine your point; which coyne by eloquence of Lord Apolloes flowres, so like the white, as nycenes selfe may doubt wheather is right. &amp; looke what truith hee saith, because he said it, deny, dissent invert, avoid, vpbraid yt; then, if nyce-false invention hide the trewe, and dorr the people, all will runn after you, to saye, naie sweare, all's trewe yee saye, &amp; iuste; naie, theyl doe more yet, if they thincke they muste. for o, but putt this word (truith) in theire mowth, and laughe for aye, to heere what lies they soothe; lies which (by ofte orechawinge) they belive so t' be authorizd by Prince Algarsive. Besides, you must indulge this seriouslie, that yee defend their pleasures libertie: so that all men maie chouse, and vse, owne fasshion, which will drawe hither some of everie nation. for heerein suche a sensive secret lies, as men will serve, suche ffreedomm t' have for prize. yea, they will lend their aydes, &amp; bringe their treasures, as, naturalie, they best love owne pleasures. Wheareof you beinge seizd, and in possession, lett not your ffather spare to bringe obsession.‚Äù The Princ, admiringe the vile witches drifte (albeet hee found twas her malgenius shift), resolves to practise yt, by proclamation, and countenance it, with faire protestation: that while hee gettes, by her fleshe-monginge fisshinge, hees apt to thincke, all comms by simplest blissinge. So thencefoorthe hee betakes all to that chaunce which fortune gives to boldest atchivaunce: and theareto gann his silkenn standard reare, which blazd a lion, pard, and prowlinge beare, in a feild gewles. these on thigh bullwarcke stowted, to ridd all fears, which the fregiliens dowbted, and lettes them knowe, hee theare will them defend, accordinge to his embleam, or theare end. and them encouraginge to stand their groundes as th' chiefest tenure of their citties boundes. Theie vowd as muche his fleshe, blood, life may doe, or make owne cradelles beeres, their homes graves too. By this the prudent kinge Cambuscan gatt ann exact draught, or mapp, of yond proud statt, which to his viewe offred her situation, with other poletick consideration, of each hill, river, passage, neereabout; ites havon', and all the scacoast theare without; ites rampiers, bullwarckes, turrettes, parapett, that fortifies the Cittadel besett, all which considered well, and to encroche. Camballo leades the vantgardes bold approche; Binate the midle ward; and Cambuscan lodd on the reare. Thus resolute they cam. Algarsife feirce, the foremost in the warrs, redd armd in steele, like a younge other mars, of nervous potence, brawny fleshe and bones (to seeke out will and appetite at once), wore on's right shoulder to the left side hanginge, a blood redd skarff, adowne his knee dependinge: and on his helme a plume of ostridge redd, which (dauncinge as hee movd) movinge thretned twoe thowsand pikes and shott, ledd by th' north port, t'expect in ambushe Camballs first resort. Camballoes armor was as bright in showe as titans fyerie dart, all eies well knowe; wore on his caske a plume of snowe-drivn white, with skarff as white as mote the rest enlight; white silverne swoord, and in his hand a pike, able as well to pusshe as leade or strike. nimbler then Algarsife in spirit and witt, poletick eake to glories requisite, sendes oute a forlorne hope of readie shott, to serche the feildes and busshie glades remott. But l√¥, a muskettier th'alarum gave, for havinge discried in ann hollowe cave manie Fregiliens, which in ambushe laie, salutes their worshipps with an whole volleye; so soldierlike retierd. Whence Algarsife boldlie praesentes his troopes, and tho, as Chiefe, lodd foorth the shott the scharmishe to beginn. Tho bothe side bullettes flew through thicke and thin, quicke shott for shott, from bothe sydes, issued fast, to multiplie their whistlinge errandes haest; and more and more encreasinge, hotter grewe, till th' aier and feildes them clothd in smokie blewe; bownncinge, rebowncinge, new noise immitatinge so thicke, as Eccho told not for mistakinge. Algarsif at his brother shooke his pike: Camballo stowtlie did att him the like. naie, quicklie, with a shocke of pikes, chargd home, theare right to make his rendeuous first known. gainst whome Algarsif rann from thambuscado, to prove his ernest provd no French bravado. Theare, theare th' sterne brothers mett at push of pike; Algarsife bore it home with hast alike gainst Camball stowt; Camball the slipp gave tho, and, pointwise, bore Algarsife downe to goe, which persant stroke, dischargd vppon his brest, provd Camballs moderation was the best. Algarsif, all enragd, chargd home againe; but Camball bidd the brunt t'Algarsifs paine, for Camball hurt him; which chaffd Algarsife, Who snaught his swoord, and with a loftie whiff, rann vppon Camball, whose nought dreadinge blade, takinge the blowe, soone in att halfe swoorde made, With sparcklinge bloes and thrustes, both taen and givn, as if bothe steele cotes woold a sonder reven: no lion, tiger, panther, salvage beare, so rended either as this couple teare: insomuch that this combatt passd all others, had it not happned twixt a paire of brothers. but trewe it is, wheare twoe borne of one mother, once hatinge, farr in spite excell all other. yet still they deadlie strove, strooke, stabbd togeather, that hardlie bothe the hostes mote them dissever. It was most like this warr had neere binn ended to them which on Algarsifes side depended, incase Camballo had this combatt wonn. But it was staid by twoe knightes rasshe incomm, with more supplies to fetche off Algarsife, who told him that it ill became theire chieff to fight in private, sithe on his downe fall did hange the good or ill fare of them all. ffor Gnartoly, Leyfurco too, noold yeeld, to sett their state pon one plaine-fought out feild. But l√¥, ear they retyerd; Cambuscan wheeles, and with his horsemen at his angrie heeles, fell on Algarsifes rear, and cutt off those whome no portculleis had, ne walles t'enclose. Which donn, retyerd safe, quicklye wheelinge round, While all the bullwarckes wheele guns att him sound. The townsemens praises, ringinge Algarsife, swore him to bee ann admirable chieff; Naie, that hee, surelie, had Camballo slaine, in case theare had binn none theare but they twaine. The camp (for theire partes) as much Camball praysd, and his well tempred courage highlie raisd: thoughe ffortune envied him, the conquerer, of takinge Algarsife his prisoner. By this time the whole cam[p]e was comm in sight of Fregiley, which now they viewd with spight, scorne, and disdaine, that suche vsurpers shoold thrive, or theire handes vp gainst theire soveraigne hold. notinge Algarsifes ensigne highe displayd, and how, on th' towr, bove all the towne it gayd. manie more colors danglinge on the walls, with wanton streamers (which them sawcye calles), protested with no litle indignation gainst the lewd boldnes of his ostentation, Saienge, ‚ÄúAlgarsife, goe, and blase thy name, Which publisheth to all the world thy shame, which neither art, force, fraud, cann so immure, as all thy liefe cann thee of shame recure; for infamie this rancor diepe hath wonn, that fact once donn cannever bee vndon. and all yee, his insolent complices (whoe build on others spoiles your greatnesses), bin our times purchacers, and wee your heires, for time cann make vs flayers of yee flayers.‚Äù Cambuscan now (as twas his nobliste fashion) gave those his soldiers lovinge gratulation, whoe beate his Rebelles home: ‚ÄúL√¥, soldiers playe!‚Äù and to Ca[m]ballo thus: ‚Äúwell stoode, my boye!‚Äù Algarsife, tho, vppon the walls was comm, th' armies approche to viewe, and what was donn: What time Cambuscan soddainlie spurrd out on brave Ducello, foremost of the rowt, and gallopd close vp to this mightie towne, to speculate, and circle it arowne. first takinge perfect viewe of ites location, and of the manner of th' fortification, theire havon, watringes, and each litle creeke, theire flanckers, rampiers, ravelinges, skarf, town deeke; theire strongest bullwarckes and theire weakest places, wheare breach and entrance mote make best purchaces; theire neigboringe hills, their firme groundes without plaine, trenches to lead best, battries eake sustaine. Now when Algarsife, his owne ffather sawe, some nature strooke his hart throughe with some awe, and shame (which in the best blood blussheth ever) diverts his eies, and hunge adowne his feather; caractringe this confession on his will, ‚ÄúLo, I, which have requitted good with ill.‚Äù But lo, farr off, a ffleete of shipps discries, seeminge as small birdes soringe in the skies; the which, sithe standinge inward for the land, Cambuscan whoe they are dothe vnderstand; for so their point made with a mirry winde, as shewd theire mindes wind with Cambuscans mynd. At last they kend it was his Admiral, who the kinges embleam bore on's flagg staff tall. Don Akafir it is, who tackd all sailes, ear wind fro shore, and tyde from sea, him failes. All tharmie leapd for ioye to see their frendes; but it sadd newes to the Fregiliens sendes, Whose eies a while attended on their number, but then (in spite) gave them a vollie of thunder. ‚ÄúAre yee so brave?‚Äù quoth Akafir in iest, ‚Äúanon Ile pay this debt with thinterest.‚Äù then in hee bore for land, till th' tyde was spent, &amp; theare cast ancor to ride [?] permanent. Cambuscan next departes his host in three, besides the sea force, which in all, fowr bee. meaninge each part shoold have the townes one quarter strictlie beleager, and as stronglie batter. At th' east, Binato shoold encamp the towne; At th' west, Camballo shoold goe sitt him downe; At th' north, him selfe; At th' south, Akafir bold shoold bothe poles axil bee, their waine t' vphold. At the north side twelve canons shoold be mounted; At theast and west as many to bee counted. but from the sea as many more shoold comm as neede requird, vntill the towne bee wonn. him selfe, or Akafir, the rounde woold goe, to see all services donn to and fro; swearinge withall, hee'l near endewr this fasshion, land men gainste sea men stirr vp altercation; Which hee forbiddes, vppon moste grevous paine, till hee determine whoe meedes soveraigne. The soldiers much admird his governaunce, and with as hartie love as reverence, vowd they woold ever suche obedience give, as love gainste maiestie no more doe strive. Thus are the land men readie to bee gonn, in stowt and warlike ranckes. Tho Cambuscan gallopd as swift as fyer to the sea shore, whome Akafir espienge woold leapd ore. but soone the bote came, and transportes him out; Thoe, with all reverence, to the kinge gann lowt. the kinge directinge that hee shoold next tyde land canon ordinance, on this and that syde, to cutt all refuges from off the mayne; and biddes them all att midnight th'avon chaine. Yea, theare moore fast some shipps, that no reliefe comm fromm the sea to succoure Algarsife. then, to digg rowlinge trenches in the grown, to lead his men safe to the walled towne, which vndermoine hee shoold, that fluctuation mote sea-washe shole braines out of no foundation. Next, biddes mount twoe plottformes of highe commaund, to skowre the sea-coste, and controll the Land: all which committes to trewe Akafirs speede, sithe neede and speede convertes as theare is neede. Then biddes all his good soldiers to remember Whye, and for whome, they comm on this adventer, and them assures, that whoe deserves it beste shall have for gwerdon a kinges promise prest, bothe for the well deserver and his frend. This made all soldiers willingelie contend, and make them readie gainst the prime of tyde, ‚ÄúSaint George to borrowe,‚Äù resolutelie cried. Instantlie kinge Cambuscan skoysd to campe in th' aier, whose presence did the townesmen dampe, for well they deemd hee woold force on approches as night came on, by soldierlye encroches; his canons mounte, his battries bringe to play, if yt bee possible, ear morrowe daye. Gainste whome the Towne thus their defenses make: Horbello th' easterne part did vndertake; Algarsife did the westerne part defend; Gnartoly on the north part did attend; Leifurco did the south part stowt maintaine; and each twaine correspondes with thother twaine: Yet so, as theire seavn mountes bee mand all waies, to serve for lopeholtes on contrarie sayes. for so Videria gann them consolate, as a mayne secrett to theire posterne gate. By this, pale Titan cladd in wollen flices, Hunge welkins haull with vnwrought brodclothe syses, Wheare havinge walkd with Auster through the howse, hied westwardes home in stormes all humidous: light shrinckinge in a pace, that wisshed night mote spredd her canopie, t' hide all from sight of these Cambuscanites, least gunners eye mote from the townes seavn mountes them marckes envye, so fyer theire roringe gvnns. Now in good tyme Noblist Cambuscan, seeinge his men nye him, suppled his bookes, and with a dulcet voice drewe all mens ears vnto his silent noise. ‚ÄúSubiectes,‚Äù quoth hee, ‚Äúffrendes, fellowe soldiers, L√¥, heere the towne that lackes vs conquerers: and comm, dare wee who lacke, as time is comm, to cast vp our whole processe in this somm, without suppressinge the least worthie deede which anie man shall in this service meede. The towne, in right, yee knowe is onlie mine, herrs, his, or theires to whome I liste assigne: for this I speake, that all may better knowe, honor (if well rewarded) more dothe growe. then bee this town youres: yt I sett for prize t' each virtuous, whoe will winn ites golden flize. Canac of it is mistress, Yee her men. it shalbee hers and youres, I sweare agen. Now, if t' your selves yee propose mistresses (as did th'old Heroes, for services), then have yee twaine, my Queene and Canacye; chouse which yee liste, if so these twoe been they. but I assure yee, if yee fight for Loue, iustice that lovinge fight dothe still approve; or if it bee for iustice that yee fight, Loue proves yee love well, to contend for right. my wife and daughter made these twoe suites t'yee, Whome how yee cann denye I cannott see. saye then, for wheather of these twaine d'yee fight?‚Äù ‚Äúffor bothe, for bothe!‚Äù they cried, with mayne and might. ‚ÄúThen,‚Äù quoth the kinge, ‚Äúwellfare your honest hartes!‚Äù so all men to theire quarters quicke departes. the while Cambuscan rounded Camballs eare, this secret watchwoord which hee hath to beare to th' court of Captaines, whoe the gard attendes, it ‚Äòmorior‚Äô hight. Tho all to counsell wendes, What proiectes for approches th'ave to followe; mountes, plottformes, barricadoes, trenches hollowe, blockhowses, skonces, fortes, potarrs them t' rydd, All which Cambuscan soone decreed, and bydd a strict beleagringe, battringe eake of th' towne, b' assaultinge, scalinge, entringe, beatinge down; chieflie th' Commaunders to doe valientlie, because example entreth at the eye, wheare credit sooner winns then at the eare, While tonges well much maie talke, but no hand steare, Naie, saye well, but doe ill; Or one thinge tell, and meane another, which hee likd not well. for his owne part hee cravd this onlie glorie of owne example, goinge well before yee. They vowd they valerouslye woold; and so tooke faithfull leave, each to his charge to goe. vpmounted are the greate Artilerie, on owne huge-iron-carriages knobbie, all in a readines to bee drawn on, out of theire brazen mowthes to sweare anon in flaminge language, that all th'impious muste have theire false-traiterous groundes beat downe to duste. for canoniers, carpenters, laborers, enginers, mulcibers, toughe pioners, With ladelles, skowrers, chargers, coolers, spunges, lint stockes, powder, bullettes, leavers, thrunges, to shove the canons, ayminge by the snowt at yonder gabien loope-holes, to putt out; each canon havinge manie men at worke, to com in place, to hurt, or theare to lurcke; with manie officers all needes to plie, that nought bee left vndon, nor oft awrye. But lo, th' Fregiliens quartred are in standes, t' impeach Akafirs landinge his bold bandes. nay, all approchers, as well this as that, for still they swore they woold maintaine their statt gainst all the world, swearinge theare restes thear mayn. Howbeet, the brave Cambuscanites assayen, at everie quarter to approche dispight, and so in everie quarter ginns the fight. The shipps out rord of smoke, flame, shott, and fyer, as when grim-heavens-clowdes drawes sulphur hier, t' apprentize twoe foes to one occupation, to worcke by quite contrarie occupation: hott fier, cold water, reavinge bandes a sonder, agastes the world with lightninge, raine, and thunder. so flunge the shipps their thunderboltes on th' town. But in the meane Akafir gott some grown, thoughe some of his best soldiers weare yshott, with murderers from the walls, ear vp they gott, Yet made they head; and Akafir, afront, hewd out his passage throughe the thickest brunt, so that his followers, by his manlie plaie, sawe in the darkest night to find their waye. for hee so the Fregiliens canvacd, that the plaine feild nis their refuge, but their statt. Wheare, forcd them in adores, yea to close fight, so that on evn termes durst not trye his might. meane time hee vsd this stratagem of warr, to sticke vp lighted mattches, which from farr seemd standes of pikes and shott, hidd in the darcke; Wheareat th' fregiliens gunners made their marcke, but spent their ordinaunce and witt in vaine, While Akafir and his more footinge gaine. for his ingenious troope of enginers, stronge laborers and ventringe pioners, so lustelie beestirrd them, that by morne theire mountes and trenches came the towne aforne, to vault their skoldinge gunners in, Whoe plie to his owne soldiers more tranquilitie. But kinge Cambuscan noold spend manie shott on papern-gunners barrelles (waxinge hott): fell on them with a shocke of well armd pikes, Whoe followinge, pusshd and strooke home, as hee strikes, oreturninge all. ffor Morliuo, his swoorde, requird longe streetes the kinges highe waye t'affoord, and taught them knowe, that provokd lenitie is iustice (dealinge dewes extremitie). not one perseverant mutinous hee spaerd, Wheare iustice (in hott blood) noold cries regard; but forcd the false Fregiliens backe to ronn and shutt theire gates, by him (neere pell mell) wonn. Wheareby his pioners wrote with more ease, as feelinge his well fightinge provd their peace. so, after him, their rowlinge trenches brought as neere the walles (allmost) as home hee fought: and as they went, mountes canons with a trice, Whence all the world him grauntes iust, valient, wise. Gnartoly, this perceavinge off the walles, iollelie thus to kinge Cambuscan calls, and told, and him retold oft and agen, that his Fregiliens weare his trewest men, naie are, and wilbee (saie men what they woold), and by that faith and trothe for him doe hold: invertinge thus, th' kinges selfe delt wrongefullie, to doe his eldest sonn this iniurie. but they weare all his liege men trewe forsoothe: tho smild, as butter noold melt in his mowthe, With begginge formes to bee belivd like him, Who, iuglinge, faine woold all mens credittes winn. so with a crooked curtchie, wried aright, goglinge bothe eies, sayd, ‚ÄúAt your service dight;‚Äù Yet turninge round at all Cambuscans men‚Äî them faster raild then did the tonge or penn, of peltinge Zoilus, or bigg momus coold, gaininge the wispe of talest tipptoa skold. then what neede handes (in warrfare) knighthode raise, Wheare long tunges gunn shott mote prevent the praise? as whilome deignd this wriglinge fyrbaliste smile, crouch, begg, sigh, cogginge humilianiste. ‚ÄúSirrah,‚Äù Cambuscan lowrd, ‚Äúall yee haue loste Your principale verbe (credite) which yee boste: but if I catche yee once with one bold lye, your faire coynd truithe shall scarce yee iustefye.‚Äù With all (shakinge Morliuo) sayd, ‚Äúdoubt not, but Ile solve youres and the boies gordian knott! ne thincke your wordes, alone, have to decline your rebell selves; but this my discipline!‚Äù They waivinge him with theire swoord Sanglamort, the bothe threttes thretninge ernestes of brave sport. Meane time, Binato was sore fought with all by grand Horbillo, so that helpe gann call, vnto whose aide Cambuscan rode with speede, supplienge all in all wheare theare was neede: and made suche havocke everie waie hee went, as soone his foes rann, and within dores pent. But feirce Algarsife and Camball, this while fought, whoe shoold winn, and whoe shoold leese the soile. With so fell yernesse and continuance, with chaunge of fortunes wheele in combattantes, as wonder weare to tell; ffor now this syde recoiles, Then that side backward hyed. yet by freshe courage chargd on head againe, &amp; still, still th' breatherne, fyghtinge lions twaine, caringe, ne sparinge, ought to take or kill; for whie the wager lay on eithers will, Yet neither thone ne thother balckd the feild, for leavinge, in a manner is to yeeld. This fight Cambuscan (whose tente was in th' midle, twixt east and west) beheld, and staid a litle to see his sonnes fight out theire knightlie prize, as knowinge knighthodes type is that assise that alwaies trulie dothe: that all essaies mote virtuouslie asport the noblist praise. but seeinge Algarsife fight falsarie, the kinge russhd in amid the mutinie. att whose dred praesence Algarsife retierd, and shutt the gates (of all his syde admird). Canto octauo. Kinge Thotobun dothe promise ayde. battyre and sally bothe are tryed; Gnartolite, Leifurcke, Horbells inrode stayd. Cambuscans Love theire crueltie discried. Binato with Camballo all this night fierd in theire quarters manie a smokinge light, and placd some emptie curacies hard by, Which glimpsinge like armd men at Fregely, soone thither drewe their Gunners aimes to shoote. But th' Campe their error floutes, &amp; made this boote, that from the barricadoed groundes ygott, earlie salutes the towne with Canon shott. havinge eake cutt each passage off, path, creeke, theare to bee spokenn within their deeke. Now Cambuscan havinge them leagred fast, gan send th' intelligence theareof post haste, to Ethelta his queene and lovinge wiefe, Whoe ioid, but vengeance wishd on Algarsife. Which famous newes beinge in Serra known, fyers as for halfe wonn victories weare blown. So sent hee Amidis his page t' his frend king Thotobun of Arabie and Ind, t'impart the premisses; Whose gratulation powrd foorth this kind and kinglie disponsation, of sweetlie wellcominge th' embassadere With cheere and richer giftes then ever weare, and at departure with all love and ioie, thus hight: ‚ÄúGoe tell thie master, prettie boye, that him I love, and honor much his action, in that he aymes at th'atchett of slye faction, Whoe mote at last suche marriages begett, as no disvnion shall a-sonder sett. tell him I will auxiliaries send him, gainst warrs all difficulties, whiche maie spende him. but lett him, as hee hathe begunn, perceaver, that traitors die, and iustice raigne forever.‚Äù But these (thoughe glorious newes) much yerkd Canac, Whoe viewinge all in her perspective glasse, found they weare mingled sweete, sowr, pleasant, bitter, &amp; praefaced ioie, but steepd in sadder licor. ‚ÄúAlas‚Äù (quoth shee), ‚Äúthe best of these brave newes bin butt wars entrie, without warrs yssues. my ffather, to his honor, and with saftye hathe Fregiley beeseeged; I ioie that mastrie, for tis a brave on-sett: yet warr is warr, and still dothe one side, nay oft bothe sides, marr. ffor saye my father winn and raze the towne, I graunt that fame would blason his renowne: Yet theare is losse in winninge, wheare the winner somms their lives loste, whoe livd till warres beginner them lodd to fames highe daunger-teachinge schoole, Whose rudimentes binn hott, conclusions coole. Then if in warr wee kill our enimies, and leese our frendes, thears Joies extremities. Whence if he chastize Algarsife, my brother, Yet violence in th' act is the first mover. nay, th'instrumentes of chastninge, what bee they? are they not Canons, irn, steele? Harshe essay! that suche feirce surgeons tooles shoold exercise on mans soft fleshe, kill-curinge buttcheries, calld remedies. But if suche curinge kill, is not the remedie as badd as th' ill? Algarsif, ah, wee twaine live by one ffather, and bothe muste die of him, for ought I gather. nathlesse, I knowe my ffather loveth mee, but what if's love to mee prove hate to thee? I see my fathers wellfare is thy daunger, I see thy wellfare is my fathers slaunder. I see his saftie and thine maie not bee, but as Dylems or Contraries agree. Yet if thow die the deathe, I live that liefe Which dieth sisterlie with Algarsife.‚Äù So theare shee sobbd vntill this newe proiect gann thus out of these cruel warrs collect, ‚Äúthat warr as doubtfull is as it is cruel: wittnesse, as fyer of propertie seekes fewell, to worke vppon (if it bee combustible), so warr, ire, fier, near purposd yet in idle. Nor dothe warr promise victorie to him Who activelie or passivelie beginn; Nor th' innocent profferrs before th' nocent, savinge that th' innocent's more confident. Besides in th' chaunce of Warr, it so maie chaunce (if fortunes wheele plaie out her turninge daunce), that my father (most deere) maie in this warr bee taen, or die, or hurt. Ah, bee these farr! for if anie of these comm so to passe, Worse weare my case than hers that never was.‚Äù tho wept shee bitterlie for thone and thother, and sweetlie prayd for father and for brother, begginge withall it bee (if it maie bee) in her to make sound peace twixt all the three; much praisinge love (sweete peaces harbinger), meeke truithes, sterne Iustices colliginer. But warr it selfe her gentile hart abhorrethe. for whie? with it the Furies aye concurreth, vnlesse it bee Justices instrument, trespasses rasor, scurge, swoord, punishment; and theare shee sighd, it knowinge well before that this iuste warr had t' pay Algarsifes skore. Addinge, ‚Äúwarr bettr is ended then begunn, sithe, once begunn, th' end none knoes vntill donn.‚Äù eftsoones repraienge for ann happie end, did to thallmighties will all recommend. The while from morninges peepe till high midd noone, Cambuscans battringe Canons beat the towne at everie quarter, bothe from campe, sea, shore, whence greater battrie near was heard to rore; so dilligent oft vttred and agen, by th' industries, swett spirites of valient men, that once begun, near had to make ann end, till it demolishe all it dothe intend, plaienge continualie bothe daie and night, till coolinge time admittes some small respight. but then afreshe as if all newe begunn, rebringes these canons foorth that back weare run, againe to plaie and never ceasse to play, till battrie all th' inhabitantes dissmaye. And first his canons aymd th' aspiringe spire, wheare prowd Algarsifes standard flaunted higher then anie towr or steeple of the towne, and quicklie them requird to tatter downe; paringe theire house topps, pearcd theire earthen walls, which mowldred into heapes, and soone downe falls: for gainst great canon shott theare is no sheild then that lesse force must to the greater yeeld. whence greater cries mongst people near wear heard, wheare daunger in so manie formes appeard. so nowe deere-bought-witt by owne feelinge smart, examind neerer home their rebelles hart, to graunt within them selves kinge Cambuscan is a most trewe, iust, kind, wise, valient man; and that of pride and insolent selfe wille, they had deservd this seege and muche more ill; In so muche that the most wishd present peace, thoughe peace weare never yet obtaind by ease. √¥ powr of correction, if well extended, which soone makes to obaye, and not contemned. Th' vnkind Fregiliens, wantinge Love wileare, spake well of virtue now, though but for feare: naie, now collaudes Combuscans virtues all, which graunted that his force theire hartes apall. a certaine signe, that virtues foes are faine it to agnize, for shame, or feare of paine; and made as thoughe they woold to virtue cleve, yf Algarsife, theire chiefe, woold give them leave; and grauntes (vnaskd) that peace weare better farr then the feirce yssues of vncertaine warr. Algarsife, heeringe this, begann to thincke the people (in short time) backe from him woold shrincke sithe, maie they their commaunders virtuous see, they also all will trulie virtuous bee. Whearefore him beares like virtues nicitie, intermixt with virtues neutralitie: knowinge, hee sooner gettes whoe simulateth, then hee that churlishelie quite abnegatethe, Woold faine that all men shoold his actions deeme pure, virtuous, though affected, but to seeme. But hee and thother princes laboreth to reinforce what the campe demolisheth, because wheare Canons puissance dothe mayme, nature craves fitt vtensilles to sustaine. Then sayd prince Algarsife, with smilinge grace, vnto his soldiers (lookinge in his face), ‚ÄúYee spirites generous, resolve‚Äù (quoth hee), ‚Äúin your iuste cause stowtlie to followe mee, with hart, minde, and with vigor of all handes, Yea, with your vttmoste force, which none withstandes: tusshe! w'are not borne to die like Rattes in holes, nor hide our heades in darcke, with battes, and mowles, ne bee suche cowardes, as vp kept at baye, while canon shott (vs luklesse borne) dothe slaye. No, wee bee men as they, and dare well meete all them who vex our walkes in our owne streete. and knowe they shall, ear daye, wee meane to fight, and our distresses by owne virtues quight. Saye then, if wee shall try't; Sirrs, followe mee, wheathr theire virtues or ours trewer bee!‚Äù The soldiers verie much lovd Algarsife, and made his wronges theires, in theire owne beliefe, saienge, that his example is the sterne that guides, and shall guide them, to learn and earn. Whearvppon, in each quarter, they prepare, to charge the campes sodainlie and vnware. But lo, in dreame, this vision t' him appears, vz. ann aged-sceminge Sier, wearinge white heairs, which prefacd in his visage, veritie, and awd him straunglie, t' heere him seriouslie. ‚ÄúAlgarsif‚Äù (quoth hee), ‚Äúfight no nightes, for whie, thow shalt by daie subdewe thine enimye, whoe, turninge frend, thee bindes, till him thow kill who lives: so sweare the destanies. ffarewell!‚Äù That sayd, hee vanishd soone, agastinge all, whoe pondred, that fore Princes death, or fall, landes plage, states chaunge, or bloodie battailes losse, thighe powres (heavn's elementes) hanges out the crosse, of misticke embleams, which have to foretell, to reason, What sense hathe yet not to revell. Howbeet, Algarsife fearlesse wox, and rasshe, praesuminge, courage all eventes shoold passhe, ne reckethe prophecies, or anagogies, ne queint amphibolies, or tropologies, but all his thoughtes flewe at his newe empire, which hee termes honor (point of his aspire). and so, in th' dead of night, he passd the dike, praepard, resolvd, well armd, cruel alike, to doe all mischifes, ear they weare discried. tho charginge, the Fregiliens lowdlie cried, in all fowre quarters of Cambuscans campe, that vnexpected feare mote dieper stampe. Nathlesse, these false Fregiliens exclamation, tonitruous vprores, lowd vociferation, onlie awooke the men, which litle slept, or restinge, had their watch and wardes well kept. but to th' alarum a like wellcomm sent, Camp vollies for town vollies, lent and ment. and, iust at thinstant, all the canons plaien from towne to Campe, from Camp to towne againe, in suche ann horrid noise, and flaminge light, as if noone daie weare wedded to midd night: or as if th' pitchie clowdes of fulgrous heavn had taen their In vp, neath the spheres seaven. So now, all quarters (plaienge out their quarters) chaungd wordes for bloes, and thrustes for thrustes rebarters: till pikes, and pikes, whole troopes, and shockes of pikes, sidewise, and foreright, vibrant thrustes in strikes, bothe parties charginge, till th' fregiliens fell, and the Cambuscanites on them pell mell. Then theare warrs roughest doll they freely dell, crienge, ‚ÄúEthel, Canac;‚Äù ‚ÄúCanac, Ethel.‚Äù The verie names of Ethel and Canac causd the fregiliens allmost leese the place, had not Algarsifes statizers rann in, to putt some hope, wheare no hope was to winn. Thus all the quarters fower, in general, Weare tramplinge out warrs bloodie catterbrall, that vertue trewe gainste virtue false mote trie a trewe, iust, noblie earned victorie. Which, in the darcke, mote hardlie well bee showen, Onlie the Leaders actes maie yet bee knowen. ffor Gnartolite, who chargd Cambuscans quarter, resolvd as many as hee could to martir, whose soldiers, findinge spoile, seazd all they wishe, beate, by th' Cambuscanites vnto stocke ffishe. for Gnartolite, when he Cumbuscan spide, spurrd on his soldiers, while selfe steppd a side, because he knewe, if Morliuo him mett, the kinge woold roialie paie all his debt. whose matchlesse swoord, vppon the Gnartolites, powrd out the large reward of hipochrites. with takinge some his prisoners, chacd the rest, who came for canons, but to winn them messt. ‚ÄúSirrah,‚Äù quoth Cambuscan (in heate) to him, ‚Äúnone of your worckes of darknes, see to winn; but knowe and bee't well known, to all your town, Ile visite yee by daye, yea at highe noone.‚Äù Gnartolite soone telles what the kinge had sayd, which verie muche the guiltie towne dismayd. Algarsife, who had chargd on Camballs quarter (beinge the third time), that no furious tartar eare shewd more greedines to winn that game, which warr dothe killinge call, or to bee taen. yet still those martial breathern deadlie fought, till bothe their pikes weare broke, and swoordes flew out, most feircelie hissinge, percinge, cuttinge, stasshinge, in that same stile which death endites to crasshinge, faste grapled weare this paire in mutual locke, and strove to bringe thone vnder thothers yocke. bothe fastned, bothe fast, like fell mastiffs twaine, which hold fast eithers hold, to neithers gaine. Amid this combatt in Cambuscan cam, which Algarsife perceavinge, loosd and rann, to scape by flight. Yet prisoners theare weare taken of those who had Cambuscans syde forsaken. But Binate with Horbello so contended, as all the world su[s]pected none mote mend it. for hee the chawffinge giant putto flight, and, thoughe tweare darcke, he sawe to hitt him right. for whie? a messenger blowe at his head, assurd Binate he had that monster spedd. and in the chace some of his prisoners tooke, the rest for feare did backwardes never looke. Akafirs quarter was the more envied, for that old prophecie praesignifyed, how, by the south wind, a north tyde should drowne, and burne vp (bothe at once) Fregilia town; and after the north wind had cleerd the weather, a woman queene shoold theare commaund forever. which galld Leifurco to the verie hart, so that hee vsd all violence and art which laie in false Videriaes fallecies, to crosse, or disappoint the destanies. Whearefore hee sett on Akafir twoe waies, by land and sea; yet Akafirs arraies made good the streetes, and held them for their waies, to his and to his soldiers raftinge praise. thoughe of his leaders one they prisoner caught, whome the Fregiliens handled worse then naught, with tauntes disgracfull, and fowle indecore, which martial virtue ever did abhore: for professd soldiers reverencd weare of old as vices scurdges, virtues anchor hold. whence that profession otherwise to vse, is but presumptuouslie it to traduce. but each good soldier, if by fortune taen, was fairelie held, as of the sonns of fame. But they this leader to the vaughouse bore, wheare leavinge lawes of armes without the dore, how cowardice, how feare, how crueltie abusd his rancke, let silence put it bye: not meaninge to provoke good soldiers ire, when indigne passages they read or hier. Retraite once made, as well in towne as feild, Wearines did some litle respite yeild, till earlie Titans drowsye countenance disclosd new light: light did new matters vaunce. ffor, by daies prime, the camps rathe soldiers survaied with sharpest eies theire prisoners, Whoe, beinge viewd by daie light, weare well known to have servd once on this side, thoughe now flown: Naie, some had twice, some thrice, had rann awaye, after th'ad sworne, and tooke Cambuscans pay. At these th' whole host out roerd, and traiters howted; naie more, each soldiers boy theire basenes flowted. Wheareat these (seeminge boies theire falshode knewe) for shame (farr passinge feare) hunge th'ead, tonges gnewe. But now the martial Captaines Court down sate, to punishe peremptorilie theire fault, sithe findinge some of th' prisoners weare known spies, some revoltes, some relapsd, all enimies, whose aggravated faultes by doinge ofte of pardons hopelesse weare, Nor weare they sought. So these condemnd, thence garded weare to dye, lothd, skornd, revild, cursd of th' vulgaritie. Which Cambuscan knewe b' Amidis his page, and theareof thus disputes in his courage: ‚ÄúWhat conquest ist‚Äù (quoth hee) ‚Äúto vanquishe foes, if I, by killinge them, theire hartes doe lose? but everie mastrie makes not victorie, vnlesse the hart be vanquishd willinglie; nor force alone cann stowtest hartes subdewe, but stowborne hartes may yeeld to meeke virtue. Ile try th' conclusion, wheather force or love have greater force sterne soldiers hartes to move. but this shalb' of Cambuscans owne trophies, by love t' have mastred all his enimies.‚Äù So, to the place of exequution cominge, the soldiers, seeinge it, sett vp a ronninge, Wheare hee to th' prisoners said thus, ear they die, ‚ÄúWhie d'yee, Fregiliens, falselye from mee flye? ioine with my enimies? my state betray? as if your last howr weare not iustice day.‚Äù ‚ÄúGood Lord‚Äù (quoth they), ‚Äúwee have donn worse then this, but lett our deathes amendes make for our misse, sithe wee have nought elles left then deathe to paye, which death is trewe and iuste, wee note denaie.‚Äù so, beinge readie to turne off the ladder (deaths articl' infectinge th' beholders sadder), ‚ÄúCom downe,‚Äù Cambuscan sayd, ‚Äúyee I forgive; and if it bee your chaunce yet longer t' live, Yee maie at leasure once remember him Whoe could, yet woold not, kill yee for your synn. but doe no more (if yee doe after mee), least love convert to iust severitie.‚Äù Heereat th' whole hoste cried out, ‚ÄúGod save the kinge,‚Äù heavns hollowe vawlt his honors ecchoinge. The ioifull pardned ones could vowe no lesse then hartes, lives, deathes, all to his services. others bethought them that this noble scheone [?] instancd Canac, and Ethelta the queene. the fame wheareof spred to Fregilia towne, and to the people, who told his highe renowne, saienge: ‚ÄúTis not yond noble kinges intent to kill his sinninge subiectes that repent.‚Äù Gnartolite and Leifurco this envied, for his virtue theire malice multiplied, throughe false Videria, for (to his dispight) they hunge the prisoner vp they tooke last night. Oh, heinous deede! for ev'n this lawlesse action blewe vp in all the towne a fowle distraction, specialie mongst the soldiers, whoe protested against the fact, which lawe of armes detested. sayenge: ‚Äúfaire warrs are gone (faire quarter broke),‚Äù so swore noold fight no more, least like rope and stroke bee quitt on them per talionis Legem, as barbarouslie begun is, per ilke stetemen. 'Gainste this Algarsife negativelie contestethe, sithe beinge a fact that th' soldiers all infesteth. and swore it was dishonorablie donn, naie, worse, improvidentlie now begonn, now, while as th' kinges host stoode before their face, and cann, or maie, revenge this malice base: addinge withall, ‚Äúthis chokes all hopes of peace, which mote the warrs on fitt conditions cease; so dothe it quenche that soldierlie delight of virtue fightinge, or like virtue bright.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhie then,‚Äù quoth Leifurcke, Gnartolite and Horbell, vnto Algarsife: ‚Äúw' vnderstand you well, that now y' are weerie of your charge and paines; if so, then when you liste, laie downe the raignes, and wee'l take 't on vs. Ells, whie comm wee hither but t' hold the towne, by all waies whatsoever, for what care wee for anie tyrannie, while wee stand full possessd of th'empirie, and not one eminent to take offense, or rise for Virtue 'gainst our insolence? Sir, shall wee not kill one? yes, everie one that on our groundes leaves no stone on a stone; but wee muste weaken him (bee't wronge or right).‚Äù ‚ÄúBut that‚Äù (quoth Algarsife) ‚Äúbecoms no knight. twas Achills feare draggd Hector, when him slewe, some courage in his mermidons t' renewe. but I suche chivalrie still hate, and will, which thinckes not it dothe well when it doth ill. sithe to contende against apparant right, dothe in-lie give the lye to mental light. nor will I leave my charge, but vnderstande yee, I will in this same fasshion aye commaund yee.‚Äù Videria, skulkinge neere, arroundes their ears, and praid them marcke how him Algarsife beares, ‚Äúfor‚Äù (quoth shee) ‚Äúdoe but marcke (beet daye or night) if once hee comm within his parentes sight, and not hange downe the head, or balke the place; but in this cause near looke him in the face.‚Äù Theie vowd they woold. But l√¥, from off the campe newe daie light taught them wheare the soldiers ramp, in troops selected, for some praesent gard, charge, or supplie, which the Fregiliens feard. Now, so it chauncd after some sleapes repaste, Cambuscan, wearinge then about his waste his brazen horses bridle, as hee did, when servd on fote, and not on horsebacke ridd, bethought revenge on thilke indignitie of hanginge vp his knight in Fregelie. Tho, castinge how to serve on horse and foote, biddes battries all, and musketes wholie shoote, and make smoothe worke of th' seaun mountes &amp; the towne. So gettinge vp, he quicklie trode the rowne from east to west, from th' north vnto the south, and crie revenge, which pleasd the soldiers tooth. The trenches all full mand with muskettiers, the barricadoes with sure canoniers, the plottformes with toughe laborers, th' artillerie with swettie pioners. barrelles of powder serpentine brought out, heapes of whole canon bullettes to distrowte, and everie officer which ought attende stoode readie prest best services to spend. So theare out flies the roringst batterie on all the towne and mountes of Fregiley; tire after tire, vollie on vollie ofte, at each mount, walls peece, corner, lowe and loft, that nought theire force withstandes, nor countes their number, which quattes the townes men, makes them hide them vnder: Yet they with great and small shott still replye, hitt or hitt not, vollies of muskettes flye. and all supplies that mote bee hadd or thought, weare to the battrie plentifullie brought. all th' earth, aier, sea (to th' midle region), seeminge smoke, fyer, noise, cries, in bundled clowdes vp steeminge; which dreadfull battrye, by Cambuscans doome, had not to give ore till too morrowe noone: but all their groundworkes hee will beate to duste, and leave no stone vppon a stone to ruste. Canto nono. Fregiliaes battred; and b' assault neere taen; Videriaes practise prisoneth Algarsife; Cambuscan, by her treason eake is slane; Amidis buries him, with Love and griefe. The drowsie sonn (morn's mind sicke murner) rose, and at his north east casement sadlie shoes a great survaie of last nightes batteries, Which fewe wordes mote somm vp: ‚ÄúL√¥! wheare it lies.‚Äù L√¥! wheare Fregiliaes statelie palaces, her bewteous temples, highe piramides, aspiringe pinackles, perpolishd towres, her curious arches, trophies (honors dowres), her glorious buildinges, high walles, circuite stronge, L√¥, how fewe howrs have laid them all alonge. her proud plumes pulld, her avarice disdaind, her envies crusshd, her murdrous rage araignd, her glotonies, her letcheries cutt off, her mincinge idlers forcd to runn alooff, her artishe liers, wittie versute theeves, her fraudulent suggestions (for belives). her painted truith, her vermild modestie, her vaunted faith, subornd idolatrie, her farr fetcht proiectes to prevent the good, her false claimd petegrees t'inskrewe her blood, her eloquence, her sugred adulation, her confidence, her daringe protestation, her possessd greatnes, vpstart vsurpation, her bold presumption, boilinge emulation: Lo, time, the feathomer of wittes and spoile, hathe flunge all in ann heape, for men to smile. as fast, at first, as the Fregiliens lyed, so faster, now, they rann theire heades to hyde from the devowringe canons mowth, that weetes all vnderground and bove, if in the streetes no bullwarcke, mount, trench, celler, wall, ne rocke, ne crevis of excuse, hides from the knocke. Yet all the canons still gann shoote and plaie, for Cambuscan commaundes it, till midd daie. Scarce mote bee told, the great calamitie Which this bad peopl' endewrd in Fregiley, Wheare, dares not once peepe out, for Canons daunger, least musket shott arrest eake everie raunger. Besides which perilles, yet the future feare of ann assault (att hand), theire hartes doth [?] teare. and yet this moste afflictes their amblinge minde, that a good kinge (lovinge good thinges designd) shoold plage and kill them thus: Howbeet they swore, hee had donn all thinges well, thoughe hee doe more; saienge, his virtues they doe honor still, and love t' expresse it, mote they have own will. these bee the men woold have all good them done, and promise kepte to them, but will keepe none. a courtinge love, inheritinge the grace, of laughinge in ones throte, to cutt his face. beinge of those binn soone loste, quicklie wonn, Virtuous example makinge loste ones comm. not so of stattlinges. But kinge Cambuscan, theire hartes, throughe his late clemencie so wann, as that this folke (of virtues love in breste) could not find theare theire kinge how to resiste, but blasd his virtues so, in everie part, as made the townes all statistes calme in hart. Wheareat Algarsife, their stowt General, perplext at his stronge walls and mountes down fall, tangled the breach with benches, chaires, blockes, timber, th' assailantes entries, evrie wheare to hinder, incastinge stooles, ropes, froes, chaines, manors, beddes, and all trassh whatsoever, none oretreddes. but chifelie fortified the market place, to the church path, to helpe, repulse or chace, Well plantes the gapps with chambred-iron slinges, that the first entrers mote breake shinns and limbes. so theare was no place which did reskewe neede, but heere and theare Algarsif rann with speede, proposinge danger for his meede of glorie, that no base cowardise ecclips his storie: ne bee out reachd at versute pollecie, or once out runn at hardie chivalrie; soothinge his cause, that brave thinges ill begunn standes recompensd, if held out till rewonn. and holdinge obstinacie by dispute, to bee trewe virtue if once resolute. Wheareto, his soundest reason was his swoorde, maintaind by greatnes (gracinge well th' absurd); for faction, properlie, holdes her intent, wheather it bee by swoord or argument. so that a man mote of Algarsife saye, and of his stowt defense of Fregiley, a worser cause near better was defended, save that of Troy, by Hector, till hee ended. Midd noone drawes neere; the canons Yet ne rest, but now Cambuscan all those troopes addrest, which firste shoold force the breach att everie quarter, With valient secondes, placd to recharge after. Captaines, Liuetenentes, Ensignes, officers, all soldiers fullie armd, them selves besterrs, t' expect the march to charge, when please y? drums, so soone as from the kinge direction coms. All men have praid, and them to god commended, private debates amongst them frendlie ended; theire mistresse colors worne neere topp of pikes, to prove that wronge, which theare, to right, they strikes. Quicklie the kinge from all th' camps quarters came, and cheerlie now biddes all men write theire name, With resolute, owne handes, in that highe rowl of famous deedes, eternizinge the soule: and vowd reward, accordinge as theire actes his deere lovd Ethel and Canac respectes. onlie biddes meete him, midle of the towne, so theare shall winn of cittisens th' renowne. They vowd all faithfullie they woold saunce faile, and so expectes the signale of battaile. Now, false Videria, wishd att anie hand, they shoold the kinges owne person first withstand, and taught that in his brave repulse did lie the maine staie, point, scope of the victorie. Whearefore Algarsife placd Horbell afore, With all suche gallantes as pressd for honore, saienge him selfe, woold second on occasion, yet so, as no wheare hee neglect th' invasion. Howbeet, the soldiers lookd all sadlie out, for gainste theire kinge to deale, breed manie a doubt, sith a kinges praesence inscribes in the name a secret awe, which guilt dothe feare, and shame. Algarsife yet them cheerd vp, howsoever, and wisshd them now to fight for life or never: addinge, hee lovd his fathers dignitie, yet now must stand for common libertie: ann instance denotinge in all that faint thus, that hee that is not with vs is against vs. But l√¥, all Canons bowncd at once for signe of bataille, which mote trie it thine or mine. Mightie Horbello first came to the breach, Whose plumes seemd bove his crest the sphears to reache; most nimblie bore him, hither, foorth, and thither, to and againe, as if all weare one feather: that manie wondred at his countenaunce, others admird his glorious comportance; for whie? his pike bore manie a tale man downe, and downe once, others kepte them lowe a grown. nor wantes hee of that kind of ostentation which vaine conceipt referrs to acclamation: fallinge, most commonlie, in martial fraies the youngest from the gravest beares the praise. nathlesse, as manie carelesse as hee raught hee either mowldred, or them prisoners caught, insomuch that the vulgar admiration stoode stupified att Horbills deportation, seeminge to surphet of owne glorious geste, him cleaps of all the worldes brave knightes the best. Vntill Cambuscan, iust at th' point of noone, came in bright steele as the sonn hottlie shoone, sharpe sett throughe hunger, at this dinner time, which noblist services hath to define: soone eyenge Giant Horbills iollitie, rann at his tassant plumes vrbanitie. the pushe, thoughe downe hee putt, yet gann it rest on Horbills curate, iust amidd his breste, with such a sadd demurr, as theare hee stoode like one that chawes digestion of the cudd. But the next pusshe bore Horbell off the grown, and his third thruste laid his brave vpside downe. Wheare [h'] had binn slaine, had not prince Algarsife, o'restridd him, till hee gatt from that misschiffe. Cambuscan, it perceavinge, rann at him, But Algarsife retierd like bird from gynn, first savinge Horbells life. Tho Gnartolite came to the reskewe, pusshinge pikes endight: so theare Cambuscans selfe ev'n hand to hande, refusinge succors, did gainst bothe those stande, with chaunge of passages and thrustes so faste, as looke what fell short was made home in hast, and multiplied foorth, backe, too and agen, that near one stoode gainst twoe more doughtie men, till one trewe thruste smote Gnartolites right eie, so as his left mote rightlie see to lie. This while Algarsife with Camballo fought, and gainst Binato, whome hee feircelie sought: he fightinge to maintaine Fregilia towne, they bearinge in to make his grown their grown. pusshinge, repusshinge, vibratinge agen, as valient mortal and immortal men, he gallantlie receavinge bothe theire sourse, and theie as resolutelie quittinge force. Now as warrs chaunce beat Algarsife abacke, Gnartolites aide came in, with thwacke on thwacke, in trothe, so close they shockt, and fought so stronge, as never weaker battaile stood so longe. Akafir, this while, on Leifurco ventred, and, mawlg'r his hott designes, gott ground, &amp; entred: whome on the point encountringe, face to face, rejoicd to trie on equal termes the case, bothes fatale vibrant pikes, pusshinge repusht, and soone requitted home-thrustes as home thruste, bothes greedie pointes oft lightinge on theire crestes, and ofte vppon theire bodies armed brestes. thrice Akafir o'rethrewe him in short space, Yet prowd Leifurco vsd no lesse menace, albee't was beaten backe, and neere dismaid, if Gnartolite (full soone) had not brought aid, whome Akafir, well eienge, point wise smote, and gave him home the lie, adowne his throte: full longe they fought, all parties valientlie, Yet neither side once seene to faint or flie. Onlie Cambuscan gave Horbell the chace, and mawlger reskewes wann the midle place: for trilling th' pinn in's brazen horse's eare, he raignd, spurrd, fought, &amp; iust by noone it beare, Which, as hee wann, maintaind by knightlie fight, his foes not daringe theare t'endure his might. Wheare longe hee lookd, when his whole camp woold comm, to that same center, which for them hee wonn. howbeet they came not vp, yet fought so well, as heraultes bookes mote boldlie cronikell. Whearfore Cambuscan thence retraite gann make, Havinge longe lookd, for the poore soldiers sake. Thus, havinge wonn the walles and much good land, the drums told all men theare hee made his stand; and stronglie fortified what so hee gatt, vntill att next assault he beare the statt. And surelie this retraite much love him wann mongst the Fregiliens all, which gainst him cam: for vp they held theire handes, in signe of love, evn a farr off, which did Cambuscan move rather to spare, then b' exequution kill, knowinge bothe woold, ear longe, stand at his will. Algarsif, Horbell, Leifurcke, Gnartolite, retierd eake to theire lopeholt, fortifite. While Phebus homewardes welked fast to weste, all sides repairinge them with needfull rest, stood cautelouslie yet vppon theire gardes, by bothe sides watchd, what either partie wardes. L√¥, heere the witch Videriaes practises, whoe marckd Algarsif how at last impresse, refusd once gainst his fathr to do meane, as contrarie to nature and extreame; Shee thearefore now did plott gainst Algarsife, to bringe his liefe, state, honor, in mischife. Wheareto shee, callinge Horbell, Gnartolite, Leyfurco too, thus halcioneth her spite: ‚ÄúSirrs,‚Äù quoth shee, ‚Äúheers a daie shamefullie loste, which mote binn wonn with a litle more coste; but beinge loste, cannott bee wonn againe, with tenn times the same charge, and as much paine. Yee knowe I bidd yee marcke and eye it well, how Algarsife nill gainst his ffather dell, but startes aside, recoiles, or turnes awaie, Which proves hee correspondes with him, or maie. for had hee seconded Horbello well, Wee, not Cambuscan, had wunn the battell. whearfore, vnlesse yee meane to leese y? town, putt Algarsife, th'inconstant, hence or downe: charge him with treason, and imprison him, that yee three maie commaund, if yee will winn.‚Äù Th'applaude the motion, and imbibe th'ambition, With purpose him t'attach with expedition. So, in the night theie three, with a stronge gard, saluten Algarsife, who with them faerd, nothinge suspectinge what the matter was; and havinge traind him thence to fitter place, Horbell him chargd with treas'n, and soone arrestes him. But that word (treas'n) a litle not infestes him; Whearfore his fiste gave Horbell suche a knocke, as waivd him round as turnes the weathercock: callinge him turnecote with the tide and time, braidinge ‚Äúthou breath'ste but by this arme of mine, which whilome savd thie liefe, When as the kinge had smote thee downe, thow wantinge but killinge. ah, heer's the world, Wheare, save a cowardes liefe, and hee'l bee sure t' requitt it with mischiffe.‚Äù So theare they tooke and bound him fast in chaines, and cast in dungeon deepe, wheare he remaines att the discretion of his enimies, for whose sweete sakes did gainste his father rise. theare now hathe leasure bothe to feele and pawse, What wicked companie dothe ever cause, Which, to serve turnes, bothe sokes and bringes men in, Wheare none, at last, shall either save or winn. Algarsifes soldiers, heeringe this ear morne, rann all to armes, and in a furious storme demaundes theire General enlardgd, and swore that, till they have him out, they'l fight no more, or elles will yeeld the towne and everie man to the knowne virtue of kinge Cambuscan. Leifurco with his mates, over the gate, twixt iest and earnest thus to th' soldiers prate, but first woold by what boldnes knowe, and whie theie dare breede daungers more by mutinie? besides, assures them they shall aunswer that, if common soldiers have t'orerule the statt; eake vowinge that each mutinous in chiefe shoold feelinglie know th' prize of state-causd strife. nathles all, th' soldiers cried ‚Äúcomm bringe him out‚Äù for, beinge in armes, they feard no bugges ne rowt, nor woold rest satisfyed till him they have, While some to breake the pris'n (yet could not) strave. Midd this hurraie a drumm from Camball coms, Whoe (standinge at fitt distance) thrice he droms, in signe of parley from the campe: Wheareat silence was made to speake t' him from the gatte. ‚ÄúHorbill, Leifurco, Gnartolite,‚Äù quod the Drum, ‚ÄúPrince Camball dothe require yee three eft soon, praesume not to touche Algarsifes least heare, because hee's onlie Camballs prisonere. and that Camball envies all men alive, save him that shall take prisoner Algarsiue. againe hee vowes, if mongst yee hee miscarrie, Your lives for him shall goe to Carons ferrie; naie, biddes yee sett his brother free with speede, elles at three daies all your hart bloodes shall bleed.‚Äù The blindfold drumm was brought this aunswer t' heere, ‚ÄúDrum,‚Äù quoth these statlinges, ‚Äúbacke this message beare, t' Prince Camball, and tell him if hee comm, naie, if once stirr with pike, swoord, canon, gunn, within foure hundred foote of this oure gate, or if Cambuscans selfe ought attemptate, or these our owne mutinous soldiers, be it well known that everie of vs sweares his brother Algarsife shall then bee slaine, and this is all, as now, wee have to sayen.‚Äù This aunswer, as it husht all vp for th' time, so't taught Videria this new brond t' entine, vz., ‚ÄúSirrs,‚Äù quoth shee, ‚Äútime is now to strike at th' roote, I meane at Cambuscans owne liefe; see toot! Yee knowe that hee full ofte dothe goe the rowne singlie and meanlie garded, bowt the town, Wheare to surprize him is not hard t'effect, if wee one of his owne campe shall select, t'observe and bringe vs notice wheare hee fares, that our laid ambushe catch him in our snares. His purvier Quidauis wilbee the man, which, for reward, will betraie Cambuscan. Elles, if wee suffer him to goe thus on in winninge all our peoples hartes vs from, hee'le surelie force the towne: sithe men for love doe followe him, and this is good to prove, the love of virtue drawes all more or lesse, and love tis dothe the greatest services. but wee must purchace otherwise (if wittie), and strive to thrive in envie, not in pittie. lett this bee quicklie practizd.‚Äù Th'all agree, and false Quidauis takes his profered fee, With promise to direct them wheare hee is, so that to take him th'ambusshe shall not misse. In trothe, this false Videreaes cursed trickes the needles eie and nailes head rightlie strikes: for never did old Troies flames more incense her illions Captaines with concupiscence, then did Cambuscan by the contrarie of love, truithe, iustice, temperance, them frye to bringe all backe to such a virtuous luer as never was performd by imposture. and thearfore it behovd this Witch and then, to quenche the lampe which lighted all his men. It chauncd this night, toward ye breake of daie, as Princ Camball after some labors laie in tranquill extacie, ann vncothe dreame praesentes within his spirites this dismal schene, vz., Of his and'es ffathers tumblinge on a greene Of daintie flowres, as in Elisium seene. Wheare they, vprisinge, found them in a porch, which lodd them till a bewteous neibringe church, at whose ope dore a Ghoste in white them mett, offringe out bothe his armes, bothe to regrett. But Camball, leesinge twoe teethe, backe did raigne: Cambuscan entringe said woold comm againe. at thinstant Algarsife came passinge bye, but vanishd out of sight immediatelie. This gastfull dreame drew breath, &amp; soone awooke him, to thincke it did frendes losse, or death betoken. ‚Äúfor,‚Äù quoth hee, ‚Äúsuche impressions near bin sent vs but to forewarne what's with vs, what's against vs.‚Äù Whence hee, of theire three states, thought diversitie, Algarsifes case stood next vnder his eye, Whome to preserve and eake maintaine his drumm, this signale did his three daies doome forerunn, to weete: All his pavilion the first daie shoold bee in gratious-mercies-white araie. The seconde daie in redd it shoold bee dight, to thretten iustice blood demaundes of right. The third daie all in blacke it shoold bee rayd, to sweare that all and some shoold bee distraid. Which embleams hee bid vaunce, for foes to reede of mercie, iustice, death, how hee decreed, accordinge as his foes shoold yeeld or not, theire doomes weare written in this gordien knott. Now Canac, thoughe at hom &amp; farr from hence, so sleepie wox that shee note bannishe sense, but that of propertie it challengd sleepe to meete her spirites all in a dungeon deepe: Wheare seemd a longe speckd snake, his postern drewe and wrigled, her to stinge with forker blewe; for dread of whome shee calld Algarsifes aid, on whome the snake leapt, and him round araid, so that hee stirrd not: but (stunge) gann to swell, and dies. sithe none wiste the right charminge spell, till happelie her ffather slewe the snake, and by his virtuous wordes did th' venom slake; for ioie wheareof Canac gann laugh and singe, that all the chamber heard her carrolinge, till her owne voice her wooke: sighinge, quoth shee, ‚ÄúSome dreames bin trewe, though some but fancies bee. god sheild my ffather and my brothers twaine, and sende good newes, which I woold heere full faine.‚Äù Tho, tho it fell (alas that so it fell!) as this good kinge tried if his gardes watchd well, Quidauis, with his ambushe in the night, findes tretcherouslie out this valient knight. ‚ÄúWhoe goes theare?‚Äù quoth the kinge, ‚Äúwhome seeke yee?‚Äù than theie aunswerd, that they sought kinge Cambuscan. ‚ÄúI am the man,‚Äù quoth hee: At th'instant, l√¥, his kinglie presence awes them backe to goe. for trewe kinges this inscribe of soveraigntie, that vassalage backe startes at maiestie. yea, roial virtue such a presence beares as once ites verie eie strikes ffoes with feares. so gann stowt Pirrus lookes agast his foes, that none durst (thoughe death wounded) give him bloes. so sparckled Marius eies in the darcke iaile, as none his murdrers durst him once assaile. But then Cambuscan, seeinge theie weare ffoes, him in owne ensigne clothd and onward goes, and with his flaggstaff, vsd instead of pike, hee made it good that hee did rightlie strike. and rightlie so bestirrd, till false they fell, t' infect with traiterous shame theire cronikell. Horbell hee beat, and Gnartolite hee spedd, and baid the rest, who stood of him adredd; vntill Leyfurco caught him fast behinde, While all the troope him stabbd and hard did bind. One of his gard fought for him valientlie, but all the rest gave waie to destanie. Whence leadinge him, th'abusd with all the spight of those vile epithites which states endight, to iustifie owne wronges, and blase his slaunder, Whose popular innocence was all their daunger. naie, th' vulgar blind, whoe still their good missvse, had rather then his liefe confusion chouse, none goinge in with him but Amidis, his gentile page, Whose drerie eies sawe this, and how detested cowardes crueltie, wheare it vsurpes, dares trample maiestie. so mightie Cesar in owne colors died, topp of owne glories, which his foes envied. ‚ÄúAmidis,‚Äù quoth Cambuscan, ‚Äúgoe, begonn, for heers no place for thee now I have donn; and tell my Queene, that to take Algarsife, I, for her love and honor leese my life, and give to Canacie, my daughter deere, these bleedinge colors, which are now my beere, my love and wronges to her to signifie then when her eie renewes my memorie.‚Äù more said hee not to wofull Amidis, but gave his hand: ‚ÄúAdiewe, boie, god thee blisse.‚Äù tho fetchinge his last sighe, at noone hee dyed, in th' midle of his flowringe age distryed. thus hee, a statishe martir, caught the glorie of murdred wrongfullie, as saithe the storie. Which when the wofull Amidis beheld, hee sighd, and sobbd, and gladlie would binn killd, yet viewes his lord when he had no word lefte, after his onlie comfort was bereft: Looke howe ann ewe yeanes one poor weaklinge lamm in winter guistes, when snowe on ground doth stann, shuddreth for cold, Yea dies for lacke of meate, bleatinge owne lackes, but more for th'lambe dothe bleate, of tender love borne to the younge her owne, then when owne liefe takes last leave to be gone. so, so Cambuscan caerd for Amidis, so Amidis wepte Cambuscan to misse. so poors on his thrice-thrice-deere Lord him fedd. but ah! how gettes hee meate, his master dead? cold snow, cold love, cold kindnes, all yce cold, yet faine his pensive liddes woold him behold, ‚Äúhei me,‚Äù quoth hee, ‚Äúwhie d' I survive him dead? or whoe iste speakes of love now truith is fledd? I will goe seeke my death, which flies from mee, and tell the world what iniuries theare bee.‚Äù The vile Fregiliens, pittiinge the sweete boy, wailinge most rufullie his frendes distroie, for shame lettes him alone to doe as woold. So after his dead lord was pale and cold, takes off his ensigne, which his emblem bore, and foldes it vp as relique of honore: then tooke in armes his allmost naked lord, and gave him the best grave hee could affoord. Wheare, with some fewe, performd the funeral With simple solemne obsequies roial. and this sadd epitaphe they saie hee wrote, teeres weare his yncke, his brokenn voice the note, his soule the muse, his hart the table was, his finger the dull penn, his vowe the place: ‚ÄúHeere lies the trewe and iuste in word and deede, Whose liefe, love, hart, for foes did live, die, bleede: none was so valient. all hee left behind is counterfeate, and scarce the sume of kind.‚Äù ‚ÄúAdiewe, sweete Lord,‚Äù him kissinge ofte and aye; thence to Queene Ethel and Canac gan straie, but all the waie weepes, meltes, and wastes to mone, suppinge owne sorrowes, comforted of none; and this repeates: ‚ÄúIf none this wronge will wreake, the dead will rise, and stones them selves will speake.‚Äù Canto Decimo. Great murninge for Cambuscans losse of liefe: kinge Thotobun him wondrouslie dissleepes; winns th' town with's horse; frees yet woundes Algarsife; gives Discipline: the towne Akafir keepes. Ph≈ìbus, neere six howres with his brodest eye, sawe, full of griefe, this lovelesse tragedie, stuffd with vntrewe and vniuste homicide; but to make shewe how hee abhorrd the deede, and that th' whole world mote knowe this tyrannie, he himselfe murner turnd for companie, Doinge as near before hee did, ne since (the rather all folkes malice to convince) done, for three howres a moste darke sable hoode, When Cinthiaes fullest visage furthest stoode: t' astrologize, then truithe, love, iustice died, nature ne supranature ever lyed. Twice now had Titan wasshd his blubbled eye in Thetis bason, farr from companie, when these newes came to prince Camballoes eare, hee start vp, rent his clothes and tore his heaire, and surelie tho had falln with fittes extreame, had not his ffather taught him to demeane; but gatheringe him into ann agonie, movd, as immovd, thus tempred his outcrie: ‚ÄúWhat, is Algarsife mine, a prisoner taen? Cambuscan eake, my roial father, slane? th' one by his frendes, and thother by his people, and bothe in theire owne campes, oh, ist possible? and all so closelie donn, and I so neere! √¥ Camball! √¥ Binate! √¥ Akafire! and √¥ dull soldiers (heires of endles shame!) Wheare, wheare weare yee, when Cambuscan was slane? how shall wee looke men, naie boies, in the face? wheare such a fact infectes all with disgrace, as no excuse, ne dispute cann bee heard, for some faultes qualities bin audience barrd.‚Äù and tho repeates, that his late vncothe dreame was th' oracle of this tragedious schene. ‚ÄúWhat shall I saie, wheare doinge nought availes? what shall I doe, wheare speakinge also failes? Yet hathe it oft binn seene, the valiantst kinges, knightes, barons, dukes, have trapd bin in such stringes. treason hathe brought th' invincible to ende. √¥ yet, mee seemes, Cambuscan shoold not wend; no, no, mee seemes Cambuscan shoold not passe, thoughe all the world durst practise his disgrace; sithe wheare vntruith dares truith discountenance, it gaines but by vsurpinge truithes semblaunce. nor was it ever so extinguishd yet, but that ites least left sparcke new liefe could gett; ne shall his blood goe vnrevenged thus, but I will them distroie, who annoyd vs.‚Äù When Camballs soldiers heard Cambuscans death, passion rann them and theires quite out of breath, Whoe weepinge, flockd and swarmd to Camballs tent, swiftlie to tell all theire impatient bent: ‚Äú√¥ prince Camball‚Äù (quoth they), ‚Äúwhat have wee donn? W' are all vndon, evn evrie mothers sonn! What! have wee savd our selves, and lost our kinge? ah, heer's a feild soone loste without fightinge! out on vs! out! sithe wee have broke our word! Wear't not as good to have betraid oure lord, as to vnsecond him, as twice wee did, when wee shoold him have mett the towne amidd? Which had wee donn, the towne and daie weare oures, and this dissaster near have staind our powres. Againe, wee promisd wheare hee went before wee would him followe: could a kinge say more Then hee his promise kepte? so did not wee, sithe gonn is hee before, yet heere wee bee. Wee, who shoold fought to death for him, Yet live, while hee his life loste for false Algarsiue; whearefore of vs, √¥ what cann worse bee sedd, then that hee's dead, and none of vs made dead? fye on vs! fye! whoe are suche promise breakers, as all the world maie brand meere deedlesse speakers! ah, who noold love him whose life aimd this end, before his death to doe good to his frend?‚Äù Akafir at this speeche wepte bitterlie, because the worme of shame dothe never die, sobbinge: ‚Äúmen maie vs tax, state awe vs brake, and bugg-beard vs our master to forsake. Whearefore, good sirs, thoughe wee note make amendes, Yet maie wee on our slacke selves take revenge, not by preventinge his praecedencie, sith hee's gonn all before, saunce remedie; yet wee maie followe with like confidence, and with our loves his trewe love recompence.‚Äù On that they ioind all handes, and lowd gann crie on prince Camball to fight immediatelie. ‚ÄúNot so‚Äù (quoth Camball), ‚Äúfor to fight by night and flie by daie, steales victorie: Ne like 't. first, lett the sonn rise, that my fathers storie maie better convert with our allegorie. for knowe my colors redd are not taen downe, ne mortal blacke succeedes yet in ites rown; but morrowe morne this battaile so shall steare, as our and theire designes all blacke shall weare.‚Äù So all men them prepard gainst morrowe daie. Now, of th' fregiliens this remaines to saie, that through opinions (divers of distraction) they fell to sydes, from sides to common faction, Whence they whoe lovd Algarsif gann disdaine that his Inferiors shoold him thus enchaine. and looke how th' vulgar bablen, so they prate that ‚Äúthree vsurpers, whoe them cleapd the state, Horbello, Gnartolite, Leifurcoes grace, whoe by vsurpinge prince Algarsifes place, naie, kinge Cambuscans (wheare them selves th' inskrewe), t' extort all services of all as dewe: thoughe beinge but Videriaes water spanieles, meere settinge, sharkinge, cheatinge, mountbancke camilles, will have vs eate suche spoone meate as they give, or somm our portions vp with Algarsive.‚Äù Thother towne soldiers, whoe gainst these vp stand, and for Horbello, Gnartolite, Leifurcke bande, swore all theire processe wise is, trewe, iuste, well, because Algarsife did gainst's sier rebell: and thearfore, him a prisoner thus to hold dothe free theire state of daungers manifold, which are vnfitt for everie one to kno. ‚Äúnor ist our partes t'enquire how secretes goe. Now if these three our statt gann monarchize, obedience sinneth not it t' idolize: and what care wee, while wee participate the profittes which are cast on vs by state? they bee too wise, trewe, iuste, to err or lie in what concernes bothe them and vs so nye. Whence wee'l still stand with them, vnlesse theie fall; then hee that longest lives, lett him take all.‚Äù Now guiltie Horbell, Leifurcke, Gnartolite, castinge on chaunge, the lipp versutlie bite, Yet meaninge t' hold the raignes as longe as maie, vnlesse that nil be held which will awaye, prepard, wantes not to purge them by excuse, that from them selves mote putt off fowle abuse. for theie (kind hartes) Algarsiue did surprize not, but because hee gainst his sier did rise; Whearein they vaunte good service to the kinge, throughe Zeale and dutie in theire governinge. But now wheare their good kinge Cambuscan's slaine, ‚Äúallas‚Äù and ‚Äúwell a daie‚Äù (full oft they saien), ‚Äúthat fact of oures, n'is oures, but th' multitude who nil bee ruld, ne learn, th'are growne so rude. but gainst him, whome wee guiltie find of's death, forsoothe, theire Sanglamorte theie will vnsheath.‚Äù Touchinge Algarsife, theare theie readie stande, him to deliver vp to Camballs hand (incase they mote theire peace first make with him), for theire gainst Algarsife and th' kinge donn sinn. so murdringe towne-artes, vppermost to wricke, dare hurt and heale to gaine as poleticke. Thus did all th' factions of the towne comment, Which Camball knewe, and how theire marckett went; yea, by intelligence exactlie knewe how prince Algarsife did his fortunes rewe, Whoe (poore soule) for his pleasure sake preferrd his sense to reas'n, till smartinge, felt hee errd; for sense afflicted reas'n it leades to see that which it could not earst for iollitee. sithe Custome in makes ann habitual chaine: whence currs, once killinge sheepe, doe kill againe. so now hee found theare is no demonstration but is imperfect without contemplation, and theare in ruminates his captive state, lewdlie 'mongst princes falls enumerate, Whose wordes and teeres bothe breakinge foorth togeathr, Weare his seaes-afterbirth of stormie weather; and now b' experience of own ofte made prooff, his sense of reas'n vnlearnt to huff and snuff. ‚ÄúMy younge loose liefe which I have lost‚Äù (quoth hee), ‚ÄúWoold grive mee lesse if it did hurt but mee, yet what is deerer to my selfe then I, if it bee tried b' owne sensualitie? but my trewe honor and iust fame are lost, (love gonn) as th' vulgar to my shame discuste. then what is honor which hathe left no fame? and what is liefe which hathe lost all good name?‚Äù But hee, whose banckes orerann theire griefe with care, expressd his bale in tearinge off his heare: which yet note roote vp th' inward faultes more nye, which grow (hee gonn) on his posteritie. and thus (they saie) hee plaind (thumpinge his brest), ‚Äúbreake hart, die vip'r (of men th' vnworthieste)! I cannott saie, ne maie men speake or wright the number of my faultes which mee endight; faultes wheareof mote their period end in mee, I woold to my iust punishmentes agree. but I have causd my noblest ffathers death, his wrongfull deathe, whoe first infusd my breathe: his death, whose warrs on mee weare but of love; yet I preferrd his ffoes love his above. Was never love more lovelesselie requitted, hatinge my selfe, with hate tis iustelie fytted. Whearefore all deathes bee you in mee vnited, and snatch hence your convicted and endited; Yea doe, doe all yee liste to Algarsiue, so as hee cease to feele, and no more live, that false Algarsiue and'es vngratefull sinn bee so raisd out, as hee had never binn. lett neither earth, seaes, aier, fier, once disclose theare livd suche one as made his frendes his foes; Whoe thearfore gettes all kindes of enimies, the true, iust, false, vniust.‚Äù And theare hee cries that heavn it heard, bound in Videriaes traines, ne'ar to bee freed, no thoughe hee shooke his chaines. and tho hee glassd this in his conscience: ‚Äúno state so sure as that of innocence; but th' tranquil state to give vp t' agitation dothe surelie shipwracke make at perturbation.‚Äù so felte hee that all fleshelie purchases beginninge sweete, have ende in bitternes. Longe ear this Amidis to Serra came, Wheare hee th' misfortunes told of Cambuscane, with his last farewell t' Ethelta the queene, and Canac, whose bothe reddes paeld deadlie teene. her fathers bloodie ensigne t' her hee gave, Weepinge, said, did all the kinge wishd to have. Shee puttes his colors on behinde, before, her selfe amidd, as was her Siers decore: this halfe before, that other halfe behind, thinges past, as present, to recall to mind. ‚ÄúAh newes!‚Äù (quoth shee), ‚Äúmy brother prisoner taen! my ffather (lives hope) ioie, trust, also slaen! and I alive. Wellcomm his colors deere, my mothers widdowhode shalbee my beere.‚Äù that said, adowne shee sancke, dienge in him Whose deathes daunce did to all his rancke beginn: Wearinge his embleam th'wart her lillie brest, Which in her his newe funeral exprest. At th' sight wheareof Queen Ethel rann in hast, and in bothe armes her lithie corse embract, rubbinge her temples, stoppd all issuinge breathe, and wrunge her finger hard (th' awakes from death), givinge her spirites eake drawne by divine art to tharteirs, to diffuse what chokd her hart. and well it mote bee sworne that Ethel th' queene became the wife of so compleate a kinge; for thoughe shee weare the center of the iust, yet no love needes in her loves want distrust. naie, as her courage, so her love grewe great, each immitatinge (wiselie) eithers seate. No sooner was pale Canac raisd to life, but th' Queene vp cheerd her, saienge Algarsife shall out bee baild from his imprisonment, by suche fitt rannsom as shathe thither sent. and further, of Cambuscan, her trewe knight, thoughe hee's betraid in waginge of her right, his vertues yet have provd him suche an one as trewer, iuster, lovinger was none. ‚Äúand so much honor shall betide his name, as puttes liefe in the dead by quickeninge fame. nor shall hee die, that aye lives vnto mee, but hee my liefe shall have, I wilbee hee. yet had I rather leese him then leese honor; honor is liefe: our bothe lives ownes one owner. suche deathe is liefe, which dienge, is repeated of everie livinge soule whose love dothe speake it; still iustelie live theie whoe deigne iustice raise etherealie enshrind in mortal claies. trophies of marble, garlandes greene of baie, temples of cristal, statues faire of raie, monument of riche stones, tumb of gold mettal, choires of sweete hymnes perpetual, I will setle; all these perpolishd I will statelie build to him who was for love, truith, iustice killd.‚Äù These hopes cheerd Canac vp more then the former, Yet beggd shee to b' his everlastinge murner, as one apprentizd to griefe, care, hope, feares, Which (not dispairinge) never faile of tears. When Amidis his embassies had donn, full soone t' his lordes sepuloher backe did ronn, for love is Livelie, painefull is trewe love, Which no death of the livinge cann remove. wheare, lookinge in, his hart repeates this mone, ‚ÄúL√¥, heere the cage, after the bird is flown!‚Äù Yet theare about hee hauntes, lovd theare to bee, althoughe his eies sawe not what love woold see. Now it fell out, mongst other circumstances, Which coincide with kinges and states mischaunces, t'observe how soone ill newes abrode are hurld, told, and retold, heere, theare, about the world, as bowt the twoe poles turnes th'all rowlinge sphears, Which, if removd, woold fill the world with feares. so, if a kinge bee killd, or prisoner taen, no secrecie cann it conceale from fame, feare bears it knowne, thoughe (ofte) no man knoes howe, Yea ofte b' vnsensive meanes (as clerkes avowe); somtimes b' impression of highe shapes in th' aier, Which (as in tabliture) is theire bewraier; somtimes th' aier states and kinges actes d'aggregate, and, as in mental bodie, them translate, which th' aier, to remote aier, foorth shouldreth, till ites science into some folkes it distill. and thinges of sympathie binn quicklie known, thoughe farr off, to consympathites ythrowne; like as twoe eightes contewninge touch but one, thother, contestinge, softlie soundes anon. somtimes by force of stronge imagination, holpe by some numens highe concomitation; but with dreames visional wee liste not mell, Wheareof, perchaunce, annother time maie tell. On this it chauncd kinge Thotobun of Ind, harkeninge newes from Cambuscan (his good frend), could heere none good. Tho mental perscrutation mowlded much thoughtes in his imagination, which castinge what his frend mote doe this while gainst his Fregilien rebelles, thus gann smile, saienge, ‚Äúhee cann them chasten at his pleasure, and then sende worde theareof by line, and leasure. Or theie have simplie yeelded to his grace, Or laid downe armes, or rendred vp the place.‚Äù yet of his furthr love borne to his frend hee thus proiected otherwise in minde Wheather Cambuscans force sufficient weare, to force the towne, and it b' assault to beare: but force and fraud the weake and wise maie feare, as daungerous superlatives to steare. Out of which collectes (thoughe by wisdome drawne) he found no suche estate, or certaine pawne, how kinge Cambuscan mote (thoughe stronge) bee sure, but that Videreaes fraudes might him immure. While thus his serious thoughtes him furthered, this stronge imagination vext his head, that in his owne house laie some theeves close hidd, whoe, at advantage, woold him robb or ridd. so stronglie this impression in him wrought, as instantlie his twoe-hand swoord he raught, and rann vp to his private gallerie, Wheare his moste secret thinges and treasures lie. Now ronninge, L√¥, One with a drawne swoord coms as fast against him as he forward ronns; which stoppd him staie, as att ann apparition, which seemd at first to bee some sore ment vision. But, heedinge, saw twas his perspective glasse that shewd himselfe vppon him selfe to passe. ‚ÄúWhat! wee against ourselves‚Äù (behight the kinge), ‚Äúthis maie of somewhat elles bee th' alsioninge.‚Äù Too longe it weare to thincke of wondrous glasses; how somme at once cann shewe a thowsand faces, and some (placd aptlie for prospective) shoe theire farroff walkers neere, in th' aier to goe; some, convexd, so catch titans beames by art, as turne (contracted) to a fyerie dart; some shewe thwhole bodie, some the face alone; some shewe trewe obiectes, some the flattringe shoen; some shewe ites obiect twice as great as tis, Whearein nature and art contend as wise; some in a glasse ann absent shade have shoen, and some as worse a sight: let that alone. Thotobun was the wisest, learned kinge, that ever turnd the volumes of learninge; for, all of thighest skie and diepest deepe, in th' globes cilinder, and without dothe peepe, bird, beast, fishe, flye, men, everie creepinge thinge, tree, plant, herbe, weede, and each greene leafe that springe, veines, metall, mineralles, all kind of stones, and what earth, seaes, aier, fyer breedes to younge bones; no act of nature, moral fact divine, no propertie, but he knewe to calcine; for this was hee who made Canacies glasse, the Ringe, and Swoord, with the brave horse of brasse; and greater thinges then all this hee cann sho, but all bin curious of their skill that kno. Hee all these ominous dowbtes to explore, them calculates vp in his highest towre, Wheare soone hee found his frend distressd, evn dead, at which he stormd, And thus he feircelie sedd: ‚ÄúAnd have they vsd thee thus, my Cambuscan? Ile print thy wronges in th' blood of them anan, and skore on th' browes of their posteritie ann everlastinge shame of tretcherie. Yet raigne thow shalt, to tread them vnderfoote.‚Äù So speedelie prepares this learned boote, in a well luted violl, close incensd, th' elixal elemental quintescencd, with all th' seaun planetes, spirites, immixt togeather, and owne inspir'd breath: which gann deliver to Columbell their milke-white turtle dove, beinge their common post in case of love. Him hee biddes post for life, ear th' sonn goe downe, to kinge Cambuscan, in Fregilia towne, and give to Amidis this glasse and note, the which kinge Thotobun tyed to his foote. On speedes hee (as a seeg'd townes flienge post, to bringe backe newes of aide, ear th' towne be lost). Now, ear the peepe of daie, Page Amidis heard the doves voice on th'ouse topp ear him sees. ‚Äúgood newes‚Äù (quoth hee), tho, ronninge foorth, behold the dove brought to his hand, the message told, for this familiar Dove twixt yond twoe kinges went boldlie too and fro, as vsen frendes. Tho Columbel and Amidis in rann, and powrd thelixar into Cambuscan, Whoe foorthwith wooke in Tartarie, and rose, callinge for meate, his armor, and out goes. for ioie wheareof, (quoth weepinge Amedies), ‚Äúno treasure to a ffrend,‚Äù tho dried his eyes; and theare they sweetlie entertaind the dove, which tooke his leave, and flewe to thowses rove. Quicklie Cambuscan tho tooke from his midle his leather hunger waste, Ducelloes bridle, and armd and dond Morliuo his good swoord, tho, to thetherial welkin, he susurrd Ducelloes vsual call, Who came straight waie; And then hee chargd home, wheare Algarsiue laye, hewd ope the gates, cutt off his chaines, enlargd him, and, but with one wound givn on's head, dischargd him. Algarsifs soldiers, russhinge to the prison, and findinge th' gates wide ope, b'yond powr of reason, but missinge him, did passionatelie crie. Whereat Prince Camballs hoste rose instantlie, as at a soddaine ambusshes alarum, speedelie aunswerd by thwhole armies swarme. And tho Binato, Camball, Akafir rann to thassault, as close as troopes mote stirr: Whose choler now had in them domination, beinge revenges swifteste vindecation. but as they chardgd, ‚ÄúEthel, Canac,‚Äù they cried, ‚ÄúCanac, Ethel,‚Äù yet not a foe discried. Wheareat they musde, deeminge them fledd, or packinge, which soone denouncd that Algarsife was lackinge. But l√¥, a midd the marckett place a noise, composd of manie a rewfull-dienge voice, Which ‚Äúmercie, mercie!‚Äù cried, ‚Äúo gratious kinge!‚Äù This drewe vp th'oste, to see one glisteringe, armd, on a flaminge horse, with blasinge swoord, Whoe, like swifte lightninge, through th' Fregiliens skowrd, o'returninge standes, troopes, squadrons, all that flees, save those whome downe right blowes smote on their knees. Now, now Ducello, for his master fightinge, gave all vp to bee killd hee caught by bitinge, distroienge all and some, that stood in's way, nor left hee one vnfetchd vp (gonn a straie): in so much that they who admird this horse stood stupified, havinge thus felt his force. Not Diomedes horse (fleshe eatr of men) had e'ar th'obedience this atchivd o're them; so all men grauntes the kinges feirce bloes weare suche for strength, length, waight, ne'ar knight coold halfe so much. Tho Camball (saunce resistance) tooke the towne, albeet annoth'r first beare the renowne. Hee, hee, twas hee, whose swoordes wrath staid in time, of clement hart shewd in hott blood this signe, that onlie Loue hathe pittie to forgive Wheare iust revenge mote kill, or not reprive. behinde whome, when page Amidis theie spied, how all the matter went, was soone discried. Wheareat th'whole host flunge vp such acclamation, as when theavns does all thinges b'yond expectation, and now belivd, and sawe twas Cambuscan, Whearefore all th'oste to take all prisoners rann. Camball tooke Algarsife, and bound him fast, yet, as a frendlie ffoe, him oft embract. theare was no soldier but tooke prisoners store, and made all theires which thothers robbd before. ‚Äú√î‚Äù (quoth Cambuscan), ‚Äúare Yee now come downe, my boies? Ile give yee, for your paines, this towne: Y' all shalbee cittisens.‚Äù Tho hee alighted, and sweetl' embracd ev'n everie one he knighted, cleapinge them fellowe soldiers, and coheires of th'onors which hee gettes in these affaires. suche was this noble kinges truith, iustice, love, as all theire hartes his giftes with ioie approve. Which knowne, full manie a towne in Tartarie them yeeldes, and sent in pledges instantlie. Tho, vp hee puttes his swoord (a peacefull signe), but first hee did a gen'ral serche inioine, through all the towne, and in all secret corners, for his malitious ffoes, beinge theare soiorners, Viderea, Horbell, Leyfurcke, Gnartolite, for these weare they had donn him most dispite. But none of these could b' anie means be found, because theare was discovered vnderground a vast abisse or dungeon, ribbd with bone, right darcke, and hollowe built, and laid with lome, which had a passage to the Posterne gate, and this waie twas the traiters gott out at. Tho t' him theie brought fast bound Princ Algarsife, on whose sadd browe was writt muche woe and grife; Whome when the kinge sawe, said, ‚ÄúHence naughtie knave!‚Äù so, turnes him fro, and nought but frowninges gave. Then Amidis and Camball beggd for him, beseechinge pardon for his prisoners sinn, Whose weakenes, eake, beggd for him this good time, thus ffoes to begg for ffoes, is frendships signe. Howbeet, he balkd theire importunitie, With sterne-sett count'naunce (in austeritie), on which theie lecturd, that love to provoke dothe challenge iustice at her feircest stroke; so read they, that the maiestie of a kinge (abvsd) nis soone pleasd with eie fingeringe. Whearfore the kinge his sonn and page rebukes, saienge, ‚Äòthey want discretion in their suites, in deeminge that so coninge ann offender, audatious eake, shoold slipp on termes so slender; as if th'offenders (more of will then weaknes) shoold doe as liste, then vaunt theire weake compleatnes; so pleasures of suche weaknes woold bee th' cause.' ‚Äúbut, credite mee, sweete meate shall have sowr sawce; for single eies I knowe, from squintinge litle, and him who slilie haultes before a criple. Ells might each humorous-wanton appetite, or thirst of bribe, &amp;c., which custom hathe t' excite, begg, with selfe-rawe-made legges (as beggers kno), and cleape it weaknes: but hee scapes not so. sithe I twixt him and yee this difference putt, that y' have watcht, warded, fought with emptie gutt, and rann those wantes and daungers which I rann, but Algarsife woold none with Cambuscan; Whearefore hee shall conforme to all wee did, or by my swoord I sweare, off goes his head! Touchinge your loves suite, heere's my iuste beheste, his mother shall have him, to doe as list.‚Äù This aunswer taught th' younge suitors thus to stann, that wills the greater halfe of everie man. so Algarsife, bound, backe to Gaile they bore, not daringe to speake for him one word more. L√¥, heere the ioifull daie of victorie, of livelie mirthe, to murninge contrarie, for Phebus now, whoe whilome blachd his face, wore bright-gold eglettes edgd in richest trace, which (lett at nitent length) his orient haier made his cleere-praesence chamber everie wheare: and entringe into his cleane azurne haull, dauncd a brave galliard (which becoms the taull) With smoothe, then loftie, trickes, then smoothe againe; ‚Äúneere halfe ann howr wee saw't,‚Äù so mote yee plaine. evn as a friskinge lambe gann daunce, ronn, bound by damms kind side, ne cares to stand on ground; so lordlie Phebus frolickd in his spheare, and this of custome gann this daie each yeere, Which claimes for argument to somme to prove, swifte-fierie Sol, not earthie ops, dothe move. Cambuscan now, to celebrate this daie, solemnizd a great feast t' all men, they saie; and for his knightes of th' order honorable, of cedar kervd he built a large round table, and calld it thorder of the golden girdle, in kind remembrance of that milke white tirtle, which, on this daie, gann vanquishe death with liefe; so theare sate all his knightes, save Algarsife. To tell the dainties of their roial fare, of boild, roste, bakd, of flagons of nectare, of statelie pastworkes, of wild fowle and birdes, of march pane stuff, which closetes fine affoordes, no princes kitchen clerke coold tell in haste, for it Lucullus in Apollo past; but theare was livelie meate, and drincke to fare, which no wheare elles was founde to eate but theare. It pleasd the kinge, that Amidis his page sate chiefe guest, bove the kinge (though younge of age), because his Loue had followd him till deathe, and never left him till new liefe gave breathe. Wheareat some iocund knightes this question move, Whie the kinges selfe (as iust) sate not above? To whome the kinge the question thus discuste: vz. ‚ÄúLove without iustice is not Love, but lust, and iustice without love is crueltie; for I by love doe live, by Justice die. And iustice without truith is tyrannie; but truith without Justice is slogardie. Naie, truith without love is false veritie, as love without truith is hypochrisie. yea, love without truith is but surquedrie: So love without iustice is lenitie, such as fond cockeringe spillethe vtterlie, Which, partialie, gives and takes indulgence, while it to iustice vseth connivence. But my caracters bin love, truith, iustice; so, not to have true love, of all dothe misse, as to lacke Justice, love and truith are gone, sithe eache convertes, in wisdom, t' vnion. Whearfore, love wrongd is truiths iust ielowsie, and iustice wrongd is trewe-loves iniurie. Whence, to provoke Love and truith impiouslie, provokes sterne Justice to severitie. yet, wheare trewe love (distressd) for pittie sewethe, Justice turnes lover: Mercie all subdeweth. But falshode, which is truithes old enimie, wantes love and iustice: so n'ath lenitie. All which your soules wisdome throughe reasons eie, maie moderate to pious remedie. But love the signe, and seale is of perfection, which all deliuereth to th' vse of dilection, which multiplienge in him, so begettes, as, vpmost on my right hand, heere hee settes.‚Äù The knightes, all satisfied heereat, sate still, havinge from these his reasons heard their fill. Tho this most roial kinge bode fill the cupp, and lookd on all with cheerfull aspectes vpp, saienge, ‚ÄúMy knightes, this cupp, by th' warr, I sweare, hathe, as yee knowe, cost me right deerlie deere. now, heer's a helthe t' yee all, with all my hart.‚Äù At that adowne theire knees theie quicklie start, ‚Äúon these conditions, that this towne I wonn yee shall safe keepe by those meanes I begunn.‚Äù so, in that cupp vnites them lovingelie. Theie swore theie woold, and pledgd him hartelie. ‚ÄúNow, thearfore, sithe it is my daughters dowre, still shall yee call this towne Canacamor, thoughe other ancientes it Rosalia call; others, the standinge vp of them which fall.‚Äù That said, the knightes flunge vp theire capps for ioie, saienge, ‚ÄúViuat Canac! Viue Le Roy!‚Äù Tho, givinge thanckes, Cambuscan soone arose, of his townes reparation to dispose; and first buildes vp the walles, so stronge and hie, as highe, ne lowe, climbes o're ne puttes it buy. Next, turnes a cristal streame int' everie streete, to washe them cleane, and keepe the cittie sweete. Then, for his garrison leaves victualles store, that warr, ne peace, shoold cause it want no more; or if it chaunce some to bee of their order, hee biddes that none bee taken by disorder, but that they maie with stronge laddes fill his bandes, biddes first clapp on them bothe their valient handes, to trie, then soldiers chouse of virtuous brest, sith of tonge stories, hand glories are beste. mutinistes and wronge doers all hee hates, and biddes them all be turnd out att the gates, vnlesse theie sorrowe and repent their factes, and make amendes to doe no more suche actes; leavinge it in free choise to suche as tarrie, ‚Äúallienge them to vs, well maie they marrie.‚Äù But that sicke soldiers live stronge, and so die (active and nimble of dexteritie), hee biddes with olives fatt to rubb them over, and phisickes confidence shall them recover. Twice six gates to his towne hee edifyed, and to each gate one porter leaves for guide, t' admitt no weaponed straungers to annoie them, but, if suche will make entrie, first distroie them; and willes them providentlie watch and ward, so as all men keepe their owne courtes of gard. That said, the kinge Don Akafir gann call, Who in this service was his admirall, and, in his stead, first gracd him with th'onor of governinge his towne Canacamor: in hope hee will so faithfullie demeane, as still hee find his towne stronge, virtuous, cleane; expectinge, sithe hee leaves him chiefe commaunder, hee shall keepe in his men, keepe out each straunger; but if his owne will needes exceede licence, biddes Sentinells them shoote to bulge thoffence, inioininge eake ‚Äút' all soldiers that bee mine, that they peciselie keepe warrs discipline; nor will I so dispense with anie man, as willinglie followes not Cambuscan: Now, who so poisoneth anie water springe, let him not live, but die for murderinge.‚Äù and thus concludes, loves, truithes, and iustice storie, to bee th'eternal garland of trewe glorie. ‚ÄúDred soveraigne lord,‚Äù behight Don Akafir, ‚Äúsith on poore mee these honors yee conferr, heere I depose, ear I your towne forgoe, Downewardes my handes, my feete shall vpwardes gro.‚Äù This aunswer likd Cambuscan verie well, in whose face free forgivenes seemd to dwell. Tho lookinge vp to the sonnes middaie diall, hee told his knightes hee'l yet make further trial of theire worth (ear longe) in Serra Prouince. for surelie hee was a most stirringe prince, sithe him prepares to thilke Grand turniamente Which earst b' his heraultes, to all Courtes hee sent: by whose example everie ioifull man cried ‚Äúbootie Cella,‚Äù to depart anan. Out blewe the trumpettes pointes of victors pleasure, for, the warrs ended, peace found dulcet leasure to chaunt and flaunt out thrillant clangors hie, in aeriel carrowses to the skie: faire Ecchoes pledges seeminge to adore them, vntill theie sawe the sonn iogg home before them, as sweete, as faire, reioisinge everie hart, so sange the birdes evnsonge, his lothe depart. Canto Vndecimo. Juste Ethel deignes grace to false Algarsife; kinge Thotobun, and Theodore arives, Equestril, Togantil, Quadrumal with, &amp;c. Dueltra false, Cromatia eake convives. The wagginge foote riddes waie, Cambuscan than had many miles in fewe howres, homewardes rann, till softlie came into his Inn at night, t'enioie gladd reste, dothe travilers invite. But longe ear this, white Columbel, the post, on aierie pineons, cleaft th'orisons cost, and visited queene Ethel: Whence he fledd, to make his point o're right Canacies head. ffor ioie wheareof, when shee on highe did looke, conceavd good newes, and thence great comfort tooke; Which to report, shee to her mother rann, in hope of good newes of kinge Cambuscan. Tho Titan in th'oriental-tremblinge wave his lavor filld, his golden browes to lave, so lent his tresses to the windes to playe, in a greie amice, tokeninge fairest daye, vp lightinge travilers, to gett them gonn, for time will (as occasion) staie for non. But l√¥, as Canac stoode at prospective, her glasse discried from farr a troopes arive, makinge (in hastie sort) to Court: at laste shee sawe, with ioie, a sight did her agast, sithe soone shee founde Camball, her younger brother, had brought Algarsif, prisoner, bound, t' her mother, with his head wounded sore. Wheareat shee start, for love in her made all his paines her smart. yet now him havinge (thoughe on hardest termes), a sisters pittie on a brother yernes; whome downe shee tooke from horsbacke, in her armes, kissd, wellcomd home, and comforted his harmes, with askinge how hee fares: But hee dismaid, throughe store of miseries in aunswer sayd, ‚ÄúI seeke for deathe, yet death I cannott finde; I die, yet live, yet am to death designd.‚Äù and tho remembred, how his late-seene vision foretold, and wrapt him too, in this condition. Canac foorthwith brought Camball to her mother, Whoe, on bothe knees, presentes to her his brother: saienge, ‚Äòhis ffather now heere sendes to her her conquerd rebell sonn, bound prisoner, which prize hee deerlie bought, evn with owne liefe, yet praies her, doe her will on Algarsife.‚Äô Camball shee blissd, sayenge, ‚Äúvp, Camballo, thow art best wellcomm to mee, of ilke two. for thow com'st gladlie, of thine owne free will: but hee, constraind, so mawlger must fulfill.‚Äù whome, with sterne lookes, shee byd bee strictlie kept, so, turnd awaye: Wheareat Canacey wept. In the meane time, Cambuscan home was comm, amidd this busines, not yet fullie donn. but oh, what ioifull meetinge then theare was betweene the kinge and Queene and faire Canac, and how thwhole court of knightes gann them comport in glorious wellcoms of festival sport, men sooner maie belive then time cann tell, sith liefe seemd rise from death, ill chaungd to well. Canac, on knees, did too Cambuscan fall, With begginge grace for Algarsifes recall, which, graunt for daughters sake, if not for his, but if hee will for neithers quitt the misse, Yet for his fathers sake hee woold forgive her miserable brother Algarsiue: thus addinge, ‚Äúknow, good father, that my mother standes yet out iust, sterne, feirce to my weake brother; Whearefore, in you my sole trust is, deere father, and if yee helpe not now, wee dye togeather.‚Äù The good kinge, att her suite, recalles him in, Whoe com, his browes wore th'skarrs of shame and synn: pitchinge on knees, with countenaunce deiect, fell prostrate, and in woefull silence wept, not daringe once lift vp his rewfull eies, for guilt the guiltie dauntes to vew the skies, and conscient fault thear wears owne willfull shame, wheare reason playd false to right iust infame. This while Canac wept fast as hee, hard bye, and Camballs liddes scarce coold containe them drie. Tho, in fewe wordes, Algarsif thus begunn, ‚ÄúL√¥ heere, dread parentes, hee that was your sonn, whoe hath no features left of that degree your grace, forme, education, gave to mee: my faultes have so diepe died their guilt in graine, as of my ruine now doth nought remaine, (sithe havinge forfeyted parental love) then that my portion your dire iustice prove. I am not worthie to bee called youres, but yeeld to th' sharpest swoord of bothe your powres.‚Äù so downe he laye in final expectation of deathe-deservinge-lawes-last-stroke: damnation; wheareat the wailinge peoples drerie eye, sighd, pittied, sobbd theire Princes tragedie. Cambuscan tho drewe Morliuo full keene, and gave't to sterne-iust Ethelta his Queene, saienge: ‚Äúheere, kill him, wiefe, for I have donn.‚Äù But l√¥, if iustice turne love, teeres must comm. ‚ÄúHusband‚Äù (quoth shee), ‚ÄúI lost you once, for him, elles had yee not binn lost, but him to winn: now, shoold I kill him too, I shoold leese twoe; beshrewe my love, if iustice this thinge doe.‚Äù tho touchd his woundes with the platt of thilke swoord, which closd all vp, and instantlie recurd. whearevppon vp hee start of contentation, which inwardlie reioisd this alteration, his teeres praisinge loves virtues manifold, able to save life lost, when nought elles coold. tho findes this instance verified in sense, repentance lesse secures then providence: and ofte repeates his late seene apparition, then verifienge his present condition. ‚ÄúWhat saiest thow, Canac, if I give him thee, as francklie as thy ffather gives him mee? wilt thow and Camball bothe his suerties bee, that thow wilt (hencefoorth) him foorth cominge see, so as hee well demeane him ever more? on which conditions I will cleere th'old skore.‚Äù ‚ÄúDread Dame‚Äù (quoth shee), ‚Äúbecause hee cries ‚Äòpeccauit,‚Äô Wee bothe will sue his special supplicauit, and stand his Pleages too, so as he stand, bounde to vs bothe, in his own counterband.‚Äù Hee yeeldes, and cries: ‚ÄúGod save the Kinge and Queene!‚Äù tho Canac tooke him of them farme to feen, and with her ringe his skarrs shee cuerd, to stand at tilt and turniament in Faerie Land. Cambuscan noold forget kind thanckes to give t' his Queene, for gratious pardoninge Algarsive. ‚Äú√î,‚Äù quoth Canac, ‚Äúmy dreame is allmost out!‚Äù and musd how th' destanies brought thinges about. The fame wheareof, and other actions, flewe from coast to coast, as farr as marchantes drewe. Whence all mens tonges him honord, though near sawe him; no lodestone like to virtues powr to drawe men; In so muche that some Princes, Barons, Knightes, to feede theire eies on him, them thither dightes, not doubtinge but his known magnificence woold quitt theire paines, though but with reverence. It followes next, by th' course of Cronikel, wee more of this kinges great exploites foorth tell, whoe never woold bee idle in that thinge which touchd the point of roial managinge. Now then, sith Sol was clyminge Mars his Lion, he bode all gates bee sett wide openn by noon, saienge, ‚Äòthe Queene and hee woold then repaire to see their goodlie new-built theataire, that all they whoe gann noblie armes professe, mote, gainst this knowne daie, hitherwardes addresse.‚Äô But √¥, how mote a weaklinge poetes penn discribe, delineate, limn, in sound poem (in th' presence of the Classis Laureate), the glories of this kinge and Queene in state? the bounteous riches of theire courtlie traine; the maiestie which did all those sustaine; the knowne magnificence of their expense; the grand allowances which issue thence; the yoncker iollities of each brave knight; the shininge bewties of each ladie bright; the goodlie comportance, the sweete demeanoure; their constant loves, vnder the roial streamer; the virtuous prowesse of all them which bide, and tooke their lodginges vp on th' kinges owne side; The vanities of thother knightes and ladies; the fickell pompe of dilld vp-whifflinge babies; theire false conceipt of honor honorlesse; their vndeservd, their vsurpd greatnesses; their bewties, all sophisticate to viewe (vulgarlie vermilld to pretende as trewe); their oratories, but to counterfeate; truith mingled with smooth falshode, for excheate. now, how these divers bewties maie bee sedd, Don Sidneies Ach-idea beeinge dead, is hard to hope: yet hardie they whoe saie ‚Äúwee cann at liste‚Äù; wee others must as may. The kinge and Queene, most roialie attended, anon to theire newe theater discended, fore whome rode Heraultes bare, in rich cote armes, With cheeke-swolne trumpetters (begettinge stormes), Which chaunted as theie went, dialoge wise, and breathlesse one expectes thothers replies, till all the partes mett in one common choire, bases and trebles, seeminge t' spitt out fier, tyninge the welkinns bosome, lowe &amp; hie, to confesse full of sparcklinge melodie. Then gann ann herault make this proclamation, ‚Äúthat all knightes, farr and neere, of everie nation, beinge trewe servauntes sworne to chivalrie, and havinge ladies bewties, heere to trie by speare, swoord, sheild, and goodlie amenance (after the lore of Faerie Landes sommance), have them safe conduct given, by th' kinge and Queene, to trie in fight, whose bewties better sheene; and hee whoe dothe Canacies bewtie winn, shall have his landes, and her to wifelie twinn. and other ladies (if desert it beare) shall fittlie bee adiudgd them for theire pheare. to morrowe next, these trialles to beginn; thus god Cambuscan save, and Ethel queen!‚Äù So great weare th' peoples shootes, y? thearth it startes, for hee that makes them sport shall have their hartes. Cambuscan made small staie till hee had seene his theater, without dores and within, whose glorious roomes, lightes, furnitures, rich hanginges, tapestrye, arras, counterpointes, beddes standinges, rich sadles, for which yonder hawtie strive (as whilome did th' forgettfull Algarsiue); plate, vessell, clothe, suites of accomptlesse store, with officers attendinge at the dore, and everie roome dressd, aierd, perfumd right sweete, for knightes and ladies, when th'assemblies meete; with curious galleries for openn viewe, endlesselie roundinge, eastward westward drewe, beginninge at th'altar of truithes image, to iustices altar in equipage: but from theast gate downe to the westerne gate how spatious, longe, brode, faire th'court gann dilate, for troopes, or single combattantes, to fight, mote easelie pose heeresaie, but not sight. This donn, a noise of trumpettes from with out, gave notice of a neere arivinge Rowte of noble states, lordes, knightes, or what they bee: at whome the people out rann to gaze and see. Whose heraultes-cote-armes gave to signifye the kinge of Ind and Palestine was nye; Bunthoto, with his daughter Theodore, of bewtie excellent, and sweete decore, Who came in love and ioie t' congratulate Cambuscans noble victories, of late obtaind o're Fregiley and Algarsife, the fame wheareof, sithe yt amazd beliefe, they faine woold see with Ethelta the queene, and what these honorable ioustes woold beene; yea, whoe woold winn faire Canac to his prize, of whome th'ad heard, now faine woold see with eies. Cambuscan soone, and Queene Ethelta rose, and onwardes, with theire traine, to meete them goes, wheare they with goodliest complementes comported, cheerfull and ioious countenaunce consorted. Bunthoto kissd queene Ethel and Canac, and then did kinge Cambuscan fast embrace. Cambuscan the faire Theodora kisst; Algarsifs favor was, hee bussd her fiste. queene Ethel also Theodora kissd, and both the daughters neither either missd. these roial straungers weare to lodginges brought, with wellcoms hartier then maie bee thought, and placd in th' midle ward, on th' kinges right side, fitt for theire ease to eye, and to bee eyd. Within a while more trumpettes gann resound, that more knightes binn arivd in Faerie ground, for whome large space was made by th' marshallers, gardantes, and tipp staves, which the people stears. Tho entred, first, a trumpetter ycladd in manie winges, flame colord, staringe madd, about whose head these letters boldlie shine, which his ensigne repeates thus, ‚ÄúA famin.‚Äù Next came a woman with distended hears, Which wriglen as th'orse trottes and vp arears, speckd snakes, checkred lampernes, which turninge round, out sprange at length, and in againe vpwound: pallid her habite, wrinckled, large, and longe, and, ridinge, sange division on th' plaine songe. The next that entred was a mightie knight of limbes and posture, and no lesse of spright, Whose bever and his vmbier closd vp weare, to passe vnknowne, as after did appeare: his armor blewe, some clowdes wore, and some starrs, chaungeablie sorted, which him boldlie carrs; his bases and caparison like eied, and his great horse of manie colors pied, his tossant plume, which sublimeth his head, all colors wore, save white, that mote bee read: iaies, pecockes, parrettes fethers, ostridges, With all new daintie dies which gallantes dresse, full of devices, danglinge vp newe fangled, as nyce invention idlie dightes them spangled, that neither eie ne witt suche fancies sawe, ear figurd yet, but in newe fasshions lawe, With toies and glasses dallienge in the wine, turninge and altringe nimblie with the time, he comes: whose horse fomed the seas invndation, as th' rider felt him on owne exaltation; which puttes so bravelie off, curveddinge hie, as drewe vppon him everie wondringe eye; then onward trottes saunce stopp, or curteous stay, not deigninge ladies congees or obay; but trottes beyonde the boundes of th' trophies twaine, right so is followd by all of his traine. Next came a lustie knight, in armes as greene as okenn leaves, or verdant feildes pulleine, Whose plume, caparisone, brave bases eake, challengd the greenes of the greenest leeke; his prauncinge-dauncinge horse of dapled gray, disdaind to make the ground or aier their staye; his beaver ope shewd a smoothe beardlesse face, Which publishd boldnes rashe for iolliest grace; greene was his lance, ne ladies baisance caerd, callinge ‚ÄúSir Equestrillo,‚Äù foorth hee faerd. Next came a stowt couragious vibrant knight, larglie proportiond, and as large of might, his armor plaine, caparisone, and bases of orenge tawnie; none this knight out faces; his aburne beard gann in his eye declare, hee knewe owne strength, that none mote it compare; as though all ladies ought first bowe to him, nor held him bound to bewtie leese or winn; so lovd him selfe, and durst that love maintaine, which leavinge one, mote chaunge or chouse eake twaine; his nervous horse of sorrell shininge hyde, as smale respect hee vsed, as after glyde: Sir Togantillo cleaped was more proved, then of them which him knowes, trusted or loved. Next came a woman (mask'd) right wondrous gay, in crimson velvetes, gold-pearl-brodred raie, Which att her necke, vntill her dugges dependinge, Wore the ritch rubie of all eies attendinge: other six iewelles bove her browes vpbore, Which beggd all suitors not to scape her dore; her stead farr redder then the tawnie baye, and onwarde fared, knowinge too well the way. Close att her heeles prickd foorth a doughtie knight, Whose armor, plumes, caparisone weare dight of colors white, redd, yellow, blacke commixt, havinge a rowlinge eye, right seldom fixt: a knight (in deede) that stoode at all essaies, and wondrous feirce, sithe aiminge his owne waies; skewd was his horse, of manie colors chaunginge, which lovd in manie pastures to bee ranginge. Sir Quadrimal men cleapd him, sith he leand on owne sweete appetites after he weand. Next came a knight with face in bever hidd, which beinge downe, of none it mote be spidd; his horse was of a sangine color redd, so weare his flasshinge plumes aloft his head: his armor redd, so his caparison, and redd his launce; is after th' rest ygonn. Next came a knight, whose face was also hydd, vppon a pale horse, meagerlie bestridd, in armor, plumes, caparisone all pale, his launce and swoord eake pale, thretninge fatale: this hee spurrd onwardes, praw[n]cinge to the rest, to kill him whoe grauntes not his purpose best. Then rampd twoe bowncinge gearles, scarce fresh or faire, but as frolicke lustiehead coines a paire of suche as, in the point of emulation, stande tipptoa highe for taliste vindication; wee said not best, ffor that weare to decide what mote anon by virtuous swoordes bee tryed; th'one false Dueltra (by art soundinge trewe), thother Cromatia (of no blusshinge hewe), yborne greeke Cynickes: so as yonder knightes, Whoe marchen on the waves of owne delightes. The last of these laggd a distressed paire, Frelissa faire, Reglata debonaire, bothe Romane ladies of the familie of th'ancient senators Patricij, whose fortunes hard (√¥ whoe maie fate withstande?) bound them to sea, to comm to Faerie Lande, to see the soile wise poetes caelebrates, ear since old Merlins time: O cruel fates! that it is loste, and these, in seekinge yt, for Pyrates on theire shipp and them gann hitt; so came they captives, and to Greece transported, sold, and by these badd mistresses extorted: for they, as chambermaides, bin forcd to dresse these errand pusselles, which cann but transgresse; Yet these mote sett their ruffes and clothes in print, Yea, keepe them so: elles dames will looke a squint. Nathlesse, while these twoe discreete maides bee theare, Dueltra and Cromatia seeme bothe faire: which weare not, but for Freliss and Reglate, whoe bringe in tewne what yond sluttes discordate. twice round they trott the circklinge theatere, like challengers, which all theire topp sailes reare. But this last paire, which lagged all behine, by bewties force drewe to them all mens eyen, for Camball and Binato oftenn swore, twoe fairer paragons near sawe before, then Freliss and Reglate, whome well they vye, ne once dismissd, while distance lettes them prie; naie, till they weare gonn foorth and taen their In, for th' morrowe next, When all these ioustes beginn. All these weare oppositlie lodgd to th' kinges, on th' left side, wheare they fell to banckettinges: till Phebus from his fierie coche deceedes to walke, and coole by eveninges dewe his steedes: and blusshinge welkin fell with stowtes to playe at novum, for the morrowes golden daie. Canto Duodecimo. Algarsif Theodora winns; Cambell obtaines Freliss; Binate Reglata gettes; Akafir beares Canac; slaine is Horbell, &amp;c. Canac the Falcon and Tercelets love reknettes. Longe wakes the love-sicke, and th'ambitious, scarce dreddinge anie action perilous; for, ear Aurora raught her watchet pall, these iollie gallantes for their horses call, to challenge gainst Canacy, for their own, to prove theirs fairer, and bove thother flowen; in so muche that bright Titan mote not staye, to light his torche vp to theire risinge daye. But nobliste kinge Cambuscan, in dewe time first vp, foorth calles his knightes by Dawninges prime, to waite him to the feild. they quicklie comm, ear' th' trumpettes ‚Äúbootie cella‚Äù with the sonn; before whome weare those bleedinge colors borne which blasd his cote (more honord as more worne) at Fregiley. Now vaunced weare thease on hie, on the kinges side for all his knightes to eye; trumpettes and heraultes ranckes lodd on the waye; Cambuscan then vpon Ducello gaye, came armd in th' purest-chaced-polishd gold, on which no rust, moth, canker, coold laie hold; maintaind Saint Georges embleam on his brest, Which had binn lent out, now recalld t'invest: vppon his helme a plume of white and redd maiestifyed his pace, as Ducell tredd; white was his lance, all white adowne to foote; his skarff, like colord, hunge a downe the boote. these weare of Ethels and Canacies colors, Which, with the wind, predominantlie hovers. Algarsife, after him, on trampler baye, vauncd his redd launce, elles white was his araye, and as the kinge was dight, So is hee dight: so theare rides on a verie goodlie knight. Next came Camballo on a courser white, Whose armes and colors dazled through much light of the sonns glitter, cast vppon the steele, as ofte as hee his horse touchd with his heele: and looke what's ffathers armes, and colors weare, such did hee beare, and such him out gan steare. Binato, laste (though first by forward spright) rode on a blacke horse, yet his armor bright, his plumes, lance, skarff, caparison, all white, that surelie gracd and vauncd a valient knight: yet gentil, lovinge, meeke, right trewe, and iuste (his grand siers liverie), word and deede so muste. Theire circkle went within the trophies twaine of truith and iustice, not without the plaine; vppon whose altars th'offred sweete ensence, milke, honie, olives, doves, burnt frankencense: obaisauncinge with praiers that Jehoue woold guide theire swoordes, in gaininge theire trewe love. The statues congees made as aunsweringe, much like as once befell to Pirrus kinge in Argos, when ann orackles behestes fullfilld this Prophecie: that when twoe beastes, a beare and lion, hee shoold see to fight, then shoold Deathes final stroke putt out his light; Wheare, pon ann housetopp, those beastes (made of stone) fell, one gainst thother: Pirrus sawe all done. Theare sate six Judges, bove them, Ethel th' queene, and by her kinge Bunthoto, richlie seene. but Canacye, and Theodore the faire, sate openlie on hie, the sweetest paire that ever breathd, ffor bothe theire handes and eies delt truith to meekenes: bothe gann angelize. White was Cancies robe, as driven snowe, full of the largest gatheringes, bove, belowe, with golden girdell bowt her midle bore, that formd her person perfect of decore. but on her shoulders wore a moste rich pall of needle worck, made by her owne handes all, in silke and gould, of livelie colord hewe, which well distinguish could, to knowe the trewe; and all her fathers actions livelie wrote, twice donn sith by her hand too on her cote: wheareby shee vowd still to bee known, for whie? loves handie worcke convoies to maiestie. Tho her twelve mistresses lodd her the waye, and shee by congees witnessd her obaie, notinge her ladie virgins state perfection, falles not till falles of indulgent defection. Sweete Theodoraes robe was maiden blusshe, suche as faire-clarett gilliflowres off brussh, When liquid scyntilles of heavns dewe theie weare, and the crabb white-redd garlandes freshe dothe reare; her Canac settes above her on th' right hand, good manner gracd suche straungers in this land. Algarsif now ann humble suitor fell, that he might first with yond huge Giant dell, vowinge his hate was so resolvd on him, as scarcelie mote containe to runn him in. ‚ÄúNo, no,‚Äù Cambuscan sayd, ‚Äúthow art not able to stirr so vast a bodie in the sadle: for thoughe Canacies ringe thie hurtes hath cuered, yet thow to this conflict art not envrd. boie, th'art vnskillfull: I'le kill him for thee; but if I misse, as I did, doe for mee.‚Äù ‚Äú√î ffather, then‚Äù (quoth humblest Algarsife) ‚Äúhonor mee thus farr, that I spende my liefe before yee shall once more your selfe endaunger; lett your Algarsife canvasse with this straunger, to gaine some honor to my credite loste, it yernes my soule to see this Giante boste.‚Äù Then spake the Judges, that it weare most fitt that mongst his peeres Cambuscan downe shoold sytt, and not adventer him in these essaies, but rather lett's younge sonnes spurr for the praise. Cambuscan tho lent his good horse Ducello to prince Algarsife t' cope with yond proud fello; but first yt hee demonstrates, that vnlesse hee ride this horse hee'l comm in like distresse, as earst bee-fell: Right tho hee taught him wheare and how to trill the twaye pinnes in his eare, and how to beare the raignes, &amp;c., which doinge well, hee shoold bee victor, weare it gainst Horbell, &amp;c. Algarsife mountes Ducello, that bold horse, on whome him reddies soone, for th' first occourse. The trumpettes sound the charge: And lo, they flye in mayne carrier, bothes lances pointes to trie. Theie meete amidd: bothe hastinge onwardes faire, so that bothe brokenn splitters flewe in th'aier. About they vier, and to theire swoordes they fell, but theare was suche a knightlie interdell, as never feircer classhinge, crasshinge, dasshinge, better commended a continual thrasshinge, Algarsife makinge pastime for the boyes, in hewinge, scattringe eake the Giantes toies; While Horbells wandringe mace so paid that paines, as ofte had felld Algarsife, had not th' raignes him held, whoe held them fast, so yarckd vp right middst virtues cell confidentlie to fight, Wheare vrginge necke to necke, and brest to brest, bothes bloes gave thrustes, which pawzd ne stoode on rest. But all the time these deadlie food men strove, Canac on bended knees and handes vp hove, With teerefull cheekes, fore heavn's all viewinge eye, prayd for her elder brothers victorie. so soone the Giantes armor, and his maile opd manie mowthes, att which their losse did raile; the woundes confessinge, that th'expense of blood disfleshd and him disspelfd, thoughe stowt he stoode. Ducello bangd Horbelloees horse with heeles, bites and rebites him, ore and or'e hee reeles. nay, tho Algarsife thrust throughe Horbells throte, Naie more, atth' wrest foorthwith his hand off smote: his wild horse feelinge the raignes loose, thence rann, and threw his Rider downe, a vanquisd man. The iudges this pronouncd for victorie, wheareat the trumpettes clangen mirrelie, with greater ioie, for whie? It now was known that this was grand Horbell, one of his ffoen; all men admiringe chaunce, sith so yt was Algarsifes iust revenge came well to passe. Next Equestrillo to revenge this ffrend, spurrd rashlie or'e the greene; which Camball kend, and as the trumpettes bodd flewe to the charge, ffoes mett theire foes, pointes pointed eithers targe, but th' buff on Equestrillo paid suche force as all most forcd his necke beyond his horse. the lances broke, theire angrie blades came nyer to beate from bothe helmes fier-brandes sparkes of fyer, for termes of peace had theare brochd this condition, to fight, and still to fight, saunce intermission. at last Camballo him betooke a wound, Wheareof fell downe (vnhorsd) in deadlie swound. Which Togantillo, storminge, soone did enter theare to revenge his brothers missadventer; rann att couragious Camball with his speare, which stowtlie on his Targe hee off did beare, and loppd his tossant plumes; that downe a downe they fell to take vp now and then a wowne. longe, bloodie, cruell, breathlesse was theire fighte, wheare force and skill wanted nor art ne might, Will aye aboundinge t' bringe to eithers bent, and eithers will was eithers will t' prevent: at last resolvd Camball so rann him in, as Togantilloes liefe blood out did spinn, but l√¥ (straunge chaunce) pon's swowninge brother falles, wheare (wounded bothe) th'one thus on thother calles: vz., ‚ÄúBrother, our times bee come, wee bothe muste die, to him who well winns from vs victorie.‚Äù tho, ioininge handes gann thus to Camball saye: ‚ÄúSir knight, yhave noblie vanquishd vs this daie; our lives, hopes, honors, and our armes are youres, take them, but give vs knightlie sepultures. Your force in vs dothe willinglie contend to honor victorie in ffoe or ffrend; youres is the conquest now by faire desert.‚Äù thus beinge readie deathward to depart, bothe brothers kissd, and bidd adiewe. At this Camball alightes, and att one woefull kisse drewe bothe theire breathes into his frendlie breste, and made theire funeralles his livinge chest: leavinge ann instance, that all frendlie foes shall mix theire mirth with griefe ear hence they goes, and so to tender others overthrowne, as if like fortune made the case his owne. The Judge pronouncd for Camballs victorie, and trumpettes clangor told it to the skie. But now Binate gainst Quadrumal outran, at trumpetes blast to fight it man to man; whose horses, speares, armes, bodies, crassh togeather like th'ocean tide, and land floodes stormie weather, and soone theire blades, like flaialles of the forge, droppd fierworkes, &amp; on theire brave plumes disgorge what emptes the liefe in ventinge vital blood, thears no lesse to bee lookd in deadlie food. naie, other resolution theare is none, then that one of these twaine muste goe from home. In short, Binatoes vantage could him killd, Which Quadrumal perceavinge, faire did yeeld: grauntinge, that they whoe fight to death doe err, when nillinge yeeld to trewe knightes prisoner. At that, the trumpettes and the Judges bothe resoundes the victories of powrfull trothe. And now, these twoe vnknown knightes pricken out, for whie? not one with them (as yet) had fought, which causd them dare bigg wordes, and lowdlie swagger, lawghinge, they wanted worke; swears by no begger. This bread impatience in the weerie knightes, Whearefore against them bothe Algarsife dightes. ‚ÄúNo, no, not now‚Äù (quoth all the Judges tho), ‚Äúleast yee bee weerie all, as legges may goe.‚Äù Cambuscan, tho woold fought 'gainst bothe at once, but th' Judges vsinge stronge dissuasions, his roial patience cravd a litle while, Wheareat these Braggadochioes thus gann smile, vz., ‚Äúffaire sirrs, sith your side hath smale store of knightes, lett vs, this other waye, reioise our sprightes: wee have twoe Ladies, which, with your trim paire, dare vendicate to singe, whearefore they dare; Dueltra and Cromatia hight bin they, will bringe vs victorie from your fine tway.‚Äù tho, near 'fore geese did the most ielleous ganders wrinckle more fethered browes, then these challangers. Canac wox angrie at this challenge prowd (as loth t' compare her face to th' beetle browd), ne brookd her name shoold bable in suche mowthes, as are the knowne-horse faire of all vntrowthes; yet beckeninge silence of the peoples crowd, her congewe softe prefacd her musicke lowd, for shee was qualified, and Theodore, in musickes theorem and practicke lore; and theareto tewnd foorthwith her angelles voice, sweete Theodore makinge like heavnlie noise. ‚ÄúDueltra‚Äù (quoth Canac), ‚Äúaunswer this note;‚Äù withall, a Large, in vnisone shee smote. Dueltra gainste her did a Second singe, which is a discorde and false descantinge. ‚ÄúVah!‚Äù (quoth Canac), ‚Äúyee broke your name right well, elles how mote wee, in yee your falshode spell?‚Äù Dueltra then (to mende her former fault) songe out a seaunth, which as a second's naught; yet swore her false cordes trewe, Canacies false, for whoe knoes not, but that truith lyers galles? Then Theodore a fiuth sunge, and ann eighte, Cromatia sunge a Fourth and seunth evn streight, and vauntes hers sweete &amp; trewe (how harshe soever), ne woold blushe at twoe fiuthes or eightes togeather; which causd thwhole audience laugh, &amp; stopp theire eares, for tis ann hell brall wheare fowle discord fleares. H√¢, but their maides Frelissa, with Reglate, prompted theire Dames gainst false descantes relate, by causinge them to singe oft sharpe, ofte flatt, &amp; with discreete restes, false cordes, trewe to chatt; and so to reconcile imperfect cordes, as notes cromaticke dulcet tewnes afoordes. wheareby Dueltra and Cromatia gaind to singe some notes sweete, though them selves but feignd; for solid musicke, simple, perfect, sweete, these (without helpe) can neither keepe ne meete. Wittnesse theire masked Ladie (theare so gaye), which pulld Reglate and Freliss quite awaye; but, then to heere hell kennelles-dismall-hussh, Dueltra with Cromatia made (saunce blussh) helpe cattes, dogges, howles, apes, to expresse theire noise, which was as well hissd out, by all the boies; Yet to that masked Ladie, those discordes more pleasinge dogg brawles weare, then sweetest cordes. Cambuscan thearfore biddes Freliss, Reglate, singe with Canac and Theodore wheare they sate, on the knowne plaine songe, miserere. Then the kinge himselfe, with his owne singinge men, Algarsif, Camball, and Binato, sunge so glorious musickes as no ear, penn, tonge taught sweeter aiers, reportinge deeper art, ne goodlier pointes sett into everie part, with relishes and trewe divisions, wrought, by descantes lore, to make good of the nought; which chirme, this choire of birdes, so lovelie close, As th' Judges heeringe, satisfied arose, saienge, ‚ÄúDueltra, with Cromatia, you, in bothe youre purposes binn found vntrew,‚Äù and swore, ‚Äúwho raves in musickes opposition, wears natures caracter of dire perdition; yet not nature, ne ought of her or th' vse, bin selfelie false or badd, but by th' abvse.‚Äù ‚Äúwhearefore w' adiudge Canac and Theodore in musicke t' have orecomm your discordes rore; yet wee, by proclamation, passport give you, to gange with yonder mates, with whome yee live now.‚Äù Most furious wox the knightes at theire disgrace, and vowd revenge: which (to maintaine in place) claimd theires for right, but Canac to be wrange. But l√¥, thear's heard annother trumpettes clange, for fame had told these ioustes so farr abrode, as hitherward Sir Akafir is rode to trie adventures for that bewteous Dame, which dauntes her lienge foes with reverend name; vppon a blacke horse, nitent as the iett, in armor (all as blacke) coms fairelie sett, With lance, plume, bases blacke as sable night wears when sh'athe mortifyed the flaringe light. Now, viewinge yond twoe knightes on th' left hand side, his owne bold trumpet bode him thither ride. so foorthe hee spurrd, as fast as Boreas hies to cleere the miste, and sweepe the clowdie skies. The first hee mett h' orethrewe alonge the ground, so owd him nought, save what hee paid in wound; Whome passinge, hee vppon that other rann, in pittie that hee should theare idle stan; about whose helmes his swoord coniurd such weather, as now the paire mote daunce without a feather. Againe, home at them bothe, and through them bothe, too and againe, hee exercisd his wrothe: and lettinge flye, hee tooke and paid againe, what none in armor saftie found certaine; nor was the matter putto furder daies, sithe praesent paiment future paiment paies. and so hee plied them for his litle time, as the last liver sweares, ‚Äúall wilbee mine.‚Äù At length, these twoe knightes (not knowinge his name) belivd hee was some right cocke of the game, which, by ofte runninge thense, woold winn the daye: but these, praeventinge that, rann bothe awaye. in trothe, 'tis all daie seene (if well puttoo't), obnoxious threttes binn but th' length of theire foote. Wheareat th'whole Theater laught, till it droope, &amp; of tenn thowsand whoopes made one great whoope, in honor of the knightes of Faerie Lande, whose prowesse lovd gainste all the world to bande. Quoth Quadrumal, ‚Äúl√¥, still how ill they thrivd (slaine, tane, or fledd), whoe gainst Canacy strivd.‚Äù whearevppon trumpettes all, bothe farr &amp; nye, sounded Canacies truith and victorie. This causd both kinges and Ethel th'queene, in haste, to give these knightes dewe honors, with repast. Bunthoto gave kind Theodore to wife, to the now-well deservinge Algarsife, with dowr, Ind, Arab, Iuda, Palestine, to bee annexd to th'ebrews of theire line. Cambuscan also gave him th'brasen horse and reignes, whearby hee did Horbello force. And to Canac hee plighted Akafir, with dowr Fregilia, calld Canacamor, and Morliuo his swoord, to save or kill in Tartarie, accordinge vnto skill. Then to Camball hee gave Frelissa faire, with Serra province, to them and theire heire. But on Binato Reglata bestowd, with Ixiopiaes dukedome, well endowd. These matches made, the waters vnderground soddainelie bore th'whole theater around: for it supported was on spindelles stand, praepard of old, and fetchd from Faerie Lande. and tho vpp spowted pipes of sweete rose water, which, fallinge on the people, stirrd theire laughter, sent from the gusshinge frendshipp of those welles, whear th' Faerie nymphes haunten their cristall celles. The nuptialles ended (as old stories saye), this maske att night came in, to marr theire play: a naked-blindfold Centaure, on a bull, winged, with bowe and arroes, sharp and dull; A ladie maskd, which wore seavn iewelles riche, of all the pretious stones that cost mote sitch, a silverne bowle, brim full of gold in hand, a purple-silkenn gowne her person spannd; Twoe knightes like mummers, cladd in different suites of redd and pale, needinge no drum ne fluites, or burninge torch, exceptinge one behind, not much vnlike the blinde leadinge the blind. The boisteous Centaure, att his first entraunce, brake halfe his hornes off, by a blundringe chaunce, which causd the nobles call more light in hall, to viewe these mummers formes habitual. But Canac glasse findinge Cupid disguizd, pluckd off his maske, Tho all weare well advisd: Videria then was known (that cursed witch), from whome Cambuscan gann all Jewells twitche, and flunge them downe, her silver and her gold: tho bode the Queane to bee fast laid in hold, and swore shee shoold bee burned att a stake, yea, thoughe (they said) once more sh'escape did make. The men weare Gnartolite and Leifurco, both handled in theire kindes ear th'are lett goe; for theie weare ire-marckd with ann M and D, so turnd a longe for theire twoe Dames to see. Theire torch bearer was Quidauis the traiter, whoe, as hee hopd no pardon, so the faiter leapd on the Centaures backe, and gott away, but hunge him selfe (for shame and guilt), they saye. L√¥, now the night gan give them all good rest, the rather, sith all ffoes binn slaine or sperste; sorrowes (hartes griefe) are gonn, which liefe distroies; solace (mindes mirthe) succeeds, that kindleth ioies: and now loves paires maie frolicke Lovers gaine, wheare love exvlts most, pairinge twaine by twaine. Then said the Judges to the kinges and Queene, ‚ÄúDredd powres, these six daies w' have emploied beene in iudginge these concertes, by trewe beheste; Now, sith victorious peace bringes all to rest, bee pleasd yee deigne vs leave, this seaventh day, that wee, as yee, depart our several way.‚Äù ‚ÄúYee shall‚Äù (quod the good kinge), ‚Äútoo morrowe part, and fare to your affaires with all our hart:‚Äù so gave them goldenn beltes of starrie straines, in mind of this good time, and for theire paines. Next, as old stories tell, when Titan shoen, the kinges and Queene calld all theire children to them, to whose behoofe Cambuscan thus gann saie: ‚ÄúWheare ffathers ende, children 'gin fathers play; Yee, daughter deere, and yee, my sonns arowe, my minde, by my examples, well doe knowe; eake dilligence foretold, my meaninge was, to make yee capable of my owne place, my honors to sustaine, and dignitie, and all to love truith, iustice to applie. I saie no more, but charge yee bee the same, yee (by caracter) seeme to signe to fame, whose seale enfeoffes your deede the same to bee, that eloquence well heeres what cannott see. to daie am I to Canacelia rydinge, wheare I will have yee all at last abidinge.‚Äù so leaves them to theire cures, and biddes farewell, all blissinge all, while none ioyes woes could tell. Tho heavens Lampe saunce freckle at adiewe, bode gratious congees-lowe to Neptune blewe, and with kind hart-sighes, blusshinge bewteouslye, gann this faire vniuerse all glorifye. After these kinges and Queene had left the place, Camball became a suitor to Canac, that shee (of office) woold attonement make betwine her falcon and her falsed make. She said shee woold. Anon neere to her mewe shee placd her glasse perspective out to viewe, that held in proiect thinges far off and nye, and caught (ear longe) the tercelettes rowlinge eye: Whoe wandringe, soringe eake, viewd on the glasse, the fairest Falcon seemd that ever was, but none alive save the shade counterfeate; at sight of whome his hart gann throbb &amp; beate. ‚ÄúI see‚Äù (quoth hee), ‚Äúann image well ykennd, of one that whilome was my verie frend: but shee is dead and gonn. How then coms it that in this glasse her figure yet dothe sitt?‚Äù At last hee also sawe him selfe thearein, hard by the Falcons side, a paire or twinn. ‚ÄúYes, yes, shees dead‚Äù (quod th' Falcon in the mewe), ‚Äúbut left her storie for the false to viewe.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat, dead? yes dead! Ah, woe is mee thearfore!‚Äù and theare the tercelet wept with great deplore, peckt deepe his brest, beatinge his winges a ground, to call her from the grave to heere his sound: ‚Äúah glasse‚Äù (quoth hee), ‚Äúmee also grave in thee! the faithlesse foile of her fidelitee. fye, fye! on kites! fye on all carrion kytes! nay, fye on mee (lost in their lewd delightes)! and √¥ earth, burie mee in shame and sinn, but lett her out, to see and take mee in: for trewer love then shee was never none, I better knowe it now that shee is gone. her carefull eie mee waited everie wheare, and shee supported more then halfe my care: my honor, and thinges of necessitie, shee bowt my person kept most lovinglie. if sicke, or whole, her comfortes weare my staye, for whie? shee ioid t' enioye my companey: frend to my frendes, foe to my foes, √¥ blest, that counselld mee, and did all for the best. yet I forsooke her, other frendes to trie, whome suerlie still I found as false as I: fraile, vaine, inconstant, But not one trewe frend, save suche as on guiltes pleasures doe attend. suche weare my newe frendes, I for these left th'old, Whearefore my griefes canne'ar enuff bee told, how I have lost my selfe, and causd her death.‚Äù tho dieper peckd his brest, to reave his breath, saienge, ‚ÄúI will goe after her, and crie; Yea, begg her kill mee for my villanie: so I will hold that death which shee bestowes, death kinder then lothd life, which here I lose. and (as death sicke) will vomite peble-stones, in signe my hard hart near was trewe but once; sorrowe shalbee my perch, lonesse my cave, griefe all my foode, her memorie my grave; hatinge my selfe, alone for her will sitt, out of my selfe, whoe gainste her did committ.‚Äù thus grauntes (vnaskd) out of owne conscient offer, that well is sayd to doe: ill is to suffer. Now Canac, whoe b'her vertuous ringe all knewe, stood harkeninge him, yet kept her from his viewe: Whome heeringe so repent and macerate, resolvd t' accept him, thoughe hee came in late. ‚ÄúGood frend‚Äù (quoth shee), ‚Äúwhat wilt thow doe formee, incase I shall restore thy love to thee, as good and faire, as safe and sound as ever; and cause debate to cease, to live togeather, if mindinge to demeane, in all compleate, no sinn without and in but is deleate?‚Äù ‚ÄúLadie‚Äù (quoth hee), ‚ÄúI meane doe all yee bedd, or failinge, pray pluck off my thancklesse head: alas, the bodies paines, thoughe phisicke heale, yet harder is the mindes cure a great deale. my love Ile satisfie (as yee endight), and enter band never to doe vnright.‚Äù ‚ÄúI take thy word‚Äù (quoth faire Canac), and tho, out of her mewgh shee lett the falcon goe. At thenterviewe, ‚Äúmehew, mehew,‚Äù hee cried, theare, theare was weepinge sore on everie syde; for bitter griefe and soddaine ioie arivd, made greater passion till the twaine revivd. Tho Canac with her ringe cuerd everie wound, and made theire frendships whole which weare vnsound. Theie, rendringe hartie thanckes, by kindnes strove, till lovers fallinge out, renewd their love: vowinge them selves Canacies servauntes ever, and Camballs too; Tho tooke leave, flewe togeather. L√¥, breach thears none, ne trespasse mongste old frendes, but by fitt recompence obtaines amendes: which ioid all th'eerers, that theire hartes and eies sprunge of gladd teeres, Love endinge ielowsies. wheareby confession, which division sawe, had spredd too farr, did from the like withdrawe, and in theire mutual vnion of consent defind all pleasures in one word: Contente. Now Vesper welkins silver crescent tynd, and hove it bove mild Zephirs pleasinge wind. Arcturus (that slowe bellman of the night) hunge out at his longe pole his candelles light, and calld (by name) the northerne wagoner to sett more sparcklinge egglettes bowt the beare; and hee, in velvetes-blewe-gold-studded gowne, Yarckd foorth his readie steedes; which vieringe rown, of twincklinge tapers drove the murninge raie, which deckt the sable herse of livelesse daie, in heavenns burninge chappell, sadd of light, which yet compares with titans glories bright. all birdes them hied to rowste, save Philomel, (the curfewe ringer, and of lovers knell), calme silence, heeringe farr, and everie beast left the sweete feildes, to laie them downe and rest. This, or like this, th'ingenious Chaucer wrought, but lost or supprest, near was found, though sought, in all old libraries and Londons towre: which to supplie, no poet had the powre, save sacred Spencer, whoe twoe straines did wright of Camball and Canac, and found it right. √¥ thearfore, yee, the muses frendes, that maie, give once a yeere this paire a wreath of baye, in tokenn theire greene lines doe ever flourishe, though blacke Sarcophagus their loines demolishe; and yee, theire Treasorers, ofte weepinge stones, wax tendrer, and lye softelie on theire bones; sleepe sweetlie, Sirrs, make lesse noise, ne them paine, in th' Sanctuarie till they rise againe: for they binn heavens starrs, which twincklen hier then yet all their starr gazers knewe t' aspire. And they which Chaucers figure deigne deface, √¥ lett them live in shame, die in disgrace! and never meete with other memorie then is repeated of black obloquie. Lastelie, yee woold afoord his gentile squire, if hee call at your house, a cupp of beere. ‚Äúthus endes my tale at length,‚Äù the youth gann saye, ‚Äúand if they did not well, praie god wee maie; Whoe ever keepe vs all hurtlesselie mirrie, and so have with yee now to Canterburie.‚Äù</field>
