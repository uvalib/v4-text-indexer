      <field name="fulltext">TO THE LADY ADELIZA MANNERS,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LILLIA-BIANCA. Beauteous Lady Lillia-Bianca!â Thou seem'st bowed by sufferings sore!â Yet what can the grief be, darkening Thy glad youth, so deeply o'er?â All that Earth can give and Nature, At thy very feet is thrown; Thou hast wealth, state, youth, and beauty, And a happy homeâthine own! And thine anxious, doating Fatherâ He!âthe ever kind and mildâ Would give all his heaps of treasure For his blessed, darling child! Then what can be now the sorrow Which hath bowed thee and o'ercome; And left thee, once all brightness, Thus all bitterness and gloom? Say!âwhat can be that cold sufferance Which hath made thy soul its preyâ Swept the spring-time of thy spirit, And its freshness all away? Thou wert glorious as the Midnight, When it blazes out in stars!â Thou wert beautiful as Summer, When it bursts Earth's wintery bars!â Thou wert joyous as the skylarkâ When its music, full and clear, Makes us dream the Song of Angels Is descending on the ear! One sorrow, and one only, Can this dismal change have wrought; That which should be thy chief gladness Hath been all with suffering fraught!â Love betrayedâLove wronged and blighted!â Oh! this must be source and spring Of this dreariment of sadnessâ And this early withering! They had taken her from Venice, From the glorious Ocean-queenâ Where the proud Republic's daughter Had onceâonce so happy been! They had taken her from Venice, In faint hopes the change might give Some solace to her spiritâ And bid her smile and live! She had shown but cold Uncaring Scarce appeared that change to mark; Though the world without was various, All the world within was dark! Cold Indifference seemed her feelingâ She unconscious went and came; Though the world without was alteredâ Was the world withinâthe same! She had been a Queen of Beautyâ Was a Queen of Beauty still!â Though so pallid grown and fragile, Changed so statue-like and chill!â Her long hair was of the death-black, And her eyes were deep as doomâ Once resplendentâher complexion Had out-lustred morning's bloom. She had been a fawnâa fairyâ In her brightness and her glee;â Now a wounded dove, and dying Seemed that hapless Maid to be! And the blooming, bright complexion Of that wronged, ill-fated Girlâ Colourless as Eve's young crescent, Was like palest, purest pearl. Pale as pearl or crescent glimpsing Through the clouds at evening's hour, Sate the half-unconscious Maiden In her long-forsaken bower. Her unbanded hair falls darkly Round her form so slight and weakâ Oh!ânow needeth not its shadows That pale, cold, unblushful cheek!â Her lute, untouchedâneglectedâ Lies mutely at her feet; Not to her sick ear could musicâ Save of sighs aloneâsound sweet! (Sighs!âdear Preluders of Passion, Yet dark Prophets of Despairâ Of the accumulated anguish Of the crowded care on care!) She uttered no upbraidings 'Gainst the Author of her griefâ His name pronounced she never, Though it had been dear relief! That name, too deeply written On the pages of her Heart, Still she spoke notâhad she utteredâ She had heard it with a start! For awhile they dwelt in Paduaâ Then with restless hope her Sire Took that gentlest Maid to Mantuaâ Daily seemed she to expire! Since where'er she goesâfor everâ Bleed her staunchless wounds of Heartâ That still bears with itâits dungeonâ Dwells from all beside, apart! And that miserable Maiden, With an inward-gazing eye, Saw but sorrow and distraction, And the Amaze-fixt Agony!â Timeâthe streaming Time flowed onwards, But no dear hope might array The unilluminated morrows, Or the darkened dull to-day!â And no dear hope might be shining O'er her path of perfect pain; But the unbroken spirit-darkness For evermore must reign! Lillia-Bianca and Leonardo! They are severedâit is o'er!â And the dreams she dreamed of rapture, They are witheredâthey are no more! Lillia-Bianca and Leonardo! They may never meet again! Since dark faithlessness and falsehood First dimmedâthen broke Love's chain. Hush! she speaks!âor is't but moaning?â 'Tis her silvery voice and soft!â Though so faulteringâscarce her meaning Its faint hollowness can waft! âCould I change mine unwise Sorrow Into brave high-hearted Scorn, Then my cruel fortune better Might, perchance, be brooked and borne. âBut seem all my clinging Heart-strings Like an hundred wreathing arms, Round him thrown, with strength impassioned, Love destroysâand love disarms! âAye! seem all these clinging Heart-strings Like an hundred arms clasped round The False One, who hath sternly That poor Heart in iron bound!â âAnd forgetfulness?â'twere follyâ For that to seek or striveâ If I died I might forget theeâ I must loveâif I must live!â âOh! my wretched heartâbe marble!â All thy writhing is in vainâ In Submission's torpor slumber, For thou givest me too much pain!â Then with eyes of wild beseechingâ Did she gaze upon the skyâ As she sought to look the farthest From her Maddening Misery! But that sky was bright and sunnyâ And she might not bear the glowâ Thus her glance once more fell downwards On the Earthâand on her Woe! There she sate, with eyes fixed coldly On the fair and flowery groundâ Sate there movelessâas in fetters Was that form of beauty bound!â And in heaven and earth was nothing That might soothe or check her grief!â Nor in all the space between them Aught that e'er might bring relief! Past a fairy child came bounding, In its innocence of mirthâ In its blameless, bright light-heartedness, The happiest of the earth! If the sky looked all too sunny In that trembling Sufferer's eyesâ Oh! the joy on that glad forehead More o'ertakes with pain'd surprise! If the sky seemed too resplendent To that miserable Maidâ That young child, with bliss irradiate, Makes her shrinking heart afraid!â Ev'n afraid and very tremblingâ As a fearful light had just Been vouchsafed to her long darkness!â Shining down on clay and dust! She could scarce believe the havoc That unhappiest love had wrought; And yet worse than desolation Seemed now frowning to her thought! She was once a child as fearless!â She was once as glad a childâ Once as bounding and as buoyantâ And as witlessâand as wild! Could there be a change so deadly, Without some darkening sin?â Oh! like fiends raved all her feelings, Making hideous strife within! Dared she yield up all her beingâ To a passion that could bring Such a storm of devastationâ All her soul to wound and wring?â That could madden thus and monster All her phantasies and dreams, Till her mind a howling desert Of abhorrent terrors seems!â That could make her once-glad feelings Like to demons of despair, And e'en stamp the whole of nature With the trouble of her care! It was Sorrow!âwas it Sinning?â It was Suffering!âwas it Shame?â And the broken-hearted Maidenâ 'Gan herself to scorn and blame. Then with gush of fresh self-pity, And of self-forgiveness deepâ She recovered from that phrenzyâ Nor in that stern mood might keep! âBut Oh!âI have so suffered!â Have so bled my heart awayâ With the intolerable anguish That did wound me night and day!â âI have borne such nameless torments, With such agonizing strife!â I have known such deathsâundyingâ In my young and stainless life!â âI can think not, such dire suffering Can remain unpitied thereâ In the Heaven, where all is peacefulâ Power must pity such despair!â âStill methinks come Angels trooping, With their looks of light and loveâ In a sweet astonished troubleâ From their orbs of peace above!â âOverpowered with wildering marvel, That bright Love which makes their bliss, Should yet plunge a wretched mortal Into such despair as this!â âAh! methinks I see them stooping From their beaming worlds on highâ With the Sun-blaze all o'erclouded In each Everlasting Eye! âWith such looks of mild compassion, Such pathetic wonder deep!â In each countenance like lightningâ That their Long Joy seems to sleep!â âAnd thouâthou dear child triumphant!â Little Angel of the Earth!â Thou shalt pause for very pity, In the midst of all thy mirth!ââ But the child, (who first arrested By her griefâfelt some faint awe,) Now swift bounded forwards lightly, Towards some insect gem she saw. With her arms outstretched and eager, With her clear eyes straining wild; Bounded onwards fast and fearless Now that merry little child!â And fell backâmore sorely stricken, That weary Sufferer thereâ âChild! Oh!âChild!âforbear to chase it, It may bring thee some despair!â âIt might bring thee some dark trialâ Oh! forbear the gladsome race, It might bring Pain's sting and venom! Oh!âforswear the bounding chase! âAll that seems most like a promise, All that temptsâthat doth inviteâ Makes me think of disappointmentâ Of the change and of the blight! âBut my judgments are distemperedâ And my soul and mind are sick, And where once shone hopes and pleasures, Fears and dark distrusts rise thick!â Now the grey-haired Sire despatcheth, Over mount and plain and sea, Many messengersâand couriers, Prompt to do his bidding free! âSearch all countries for their treasuresâ Bring them here unto my child; Since for her I would be spendthrift, Of the wealth my Sires have piled! âI would give an Emperor's richesâ To buy back her fading bloomâ To see her glad and buoyantâ And to snatch her from the tomb! âMy house is great and affluentâ Few can match with itâI weenâ In our glorious town of Veniceâ Still the richest this hath been!â âI could gladly drain my coffers For my daughter's weal and goodâ And wander reft and beggaredâ Where 'mid Princes I have stood! âFor my daughter I would gladly Yield the wealth might buy a Crownâ And to ransom her from sorrowâ Would pay unweighed millions down!â Those were pleasant halls in Mantua, Where the twain in sorrow dwelt, With all splendours gathered round them, And all pleasures tooâunfelt! She was still Earth's heaviest mourner, Buried utterly in woeâ And he watched her sorrows fondly, Till they seemed his own to grow! There were costly halls of paintingsâ By the mightiest masters wrought; But the rainbowed walls were shadowed By her ever-sorrowing thought! There were proud saloons for musicâ Such was discord now to her; And to passioned throes of torment Could but richly minister! There were pleasaunce-grounds (so beauteous They appeared enchanted all!) Where the bird's song scarce seemed sweeter Than the echoing waterfall! âCome forth!âmy lovely daughter, The air blows fresh and free; There's a milk-white Barbary courser, All caparisoned for thee! âRich caparisons of crimson, With deep 'broideries thickened o'er!â On the housings and the bridleâ Gleam a hundred gems and more! âHe is gentleâand full noble Is his pure and generous breed; Scarce his master would resign him With a rain of gold though fee'd! âLittle golden bells make music Round the stately creature's head; And like some flaunting zephyr, He this solid earth doth tread. âAll his mane is brightly braided Up with silvered streamers fairâ And his flowing tail is knotted All with tissued laces rare!â âAnd his sumptuous harness glitters In the streaming sunshine roundâ And sheds down a flood of radiance On the quivering burnished ground!â âWhy!âan Empress might be prouder Of his selle than of her throne!â And should deck his arched neck's beauty With her many-jewelled zone! âCome! I hear his neigh impatient; Come! the air blows fresh and free: Haste! and mount this glorious courser, All caparisoned for thee! âSuch for chase, or royal battleâ With such costly harness decked, Some Amazonian Queen, helmed, quiveredâ In old times hath urged or checked. âHis rich trappingsâgold and silver, Yield his form a dazzling frame! See! 'midst all their bickering brightenings, Looks he like a steed of flame! âAnd e'en tossing like a tempestâ Roll the waves of light around;â Where he bounds the air looks starry, And on fire the sparkling ground! âWilt please thee mount thy courser?â He is fresh from Barbary's shores!â Come, come quickly forth, my daughterâ Through these wide-flung palace doors!â âMount thy gentle steed, beseech thee!â Urged the patient loving Sireâ âThrough thy veins thou'lt feel fast flowing His high-swelling soul of fire! âThou wilt feel his proud fire flowing Through thy chilled and stagnant veinsâ And the wild storm of his spiritâ That all rest and check disdains!â One hand is on her forehead, And the other on her heart; And she goeth forth in silence, Blind to nature and to art! Long, long colonnadesâall shadowy, She passed unheeding through, Where statues ranged in beauty Might have charmed Death's frozen view!â Eachâa monument triumphant Of Earth-deifying artâ Thou lookedst at themâthe lovelyâ And they livedâin thine own Heart! These the scales might well have melted, That obscure the eyes of Death! Such bewilderment of Beauty As from life drinks all the breath! She looked not at the statuesâ She a statue seemed to be, Through some power mechanic movingâ Not with will and motion free. And her universal being Seemed vacuity of powerâ Of purpose and of actionâ In that cold and joyless hour! She hath mounted on her courserâ Through her soul shall flow his fire?â Oh! no! moment after moment Doth that Soulâin pain expire! Each instant, as it floweth, Brings its separate sting to her; And all change and variation But to pain can minister! Moment after moment ever, Of her Spirit, Mind and Heart, Seems expiring and exhaling Some wrung and tortured part. Yet with fond, fond hope her father At the Maiden's rein doth ride, And looks on his pale daughter With an almost painful pride! Her fair features finely sculpturedâ Traced in outline sharp and clearâ (While her hair the wind blows backward)â Against the sky appear! And be sure that no perfection Was ever like to hersâ Though the trouble of despairing All her inward being stirs. She was deep, deep learned in mourning, And that gave a look intense To her countenance so shadowyâ All the Soul seemed streaming thence! She was very learned in sorrowâ And that gave a look sublime To those clearly chiselled features, As one beyond all Time!â Beyond all Time appearingâ And all destiny belowâ On her brow seemed stamped the Immortalâ She had o'erpassed the world in woe! She had run a race most fearfulâ And had left the world behind!â In the great, exceeding anguish Of the heart and of the mind! So on her brow of Beauty Grief's strong finger did impress A look of long Unchanging,â Even of Everlastingness! She had run the race of Sorrowâ Struggling on to that dim goalâ With the vehemence and impatience Of the burthen-hugging Soul!â She had run that race of Sorrow, Which at first she sought to shunâ And the world seemed left behind herâ She had struggledâshe had won! Oh! she had laboured in her Suffering, As the Young for ever do, When at first the shaft of ruin Hath pierced them through and through! All their grief they strive to fathom, And to penetrate the whole Of the dark and deadly secretâ Of their wrung and wounded Soul. Every thought that can add torture To their throes they study o'er; Ev'n as School-men bent to conquer Some deep, dark learning's store! They seek not for dear deliveranceâ No! they seek more to succumb!â Nor allow the dread infliction All their energies to numb! In the o'erpowering of Amazement, They bewilderedâscarce believeâ In the truth of the inward burthen, Which their deepest souls receive! And their deepest souls they fathom, And with vain reflections rend, And increase thus the ills inflicted To a suffering without end! Every sense a separate tormentâ Every thought a separate doomâ Through their efforts and their strugglesâ Doth intolerably become! That Ocean they would fathom, They can calm not to reposeâ To its cells and depths and fountains Bring they ruffling strifes of woes! As though they feared and trembledâ Lest the tempest might not find Its path of tearing terror, Through the winding ways of mind! They bring all the rude fierce ruffling Of their trials there, and caresâ All the rage and maddening ravage Of their doom and its despairs! So through every part the tempest Is ondriven by their own deedâ And they leave no place of refuge, And they would leave noneânor need!â Give them all Earth hath to offerâ But hold back their baulked desireâ And they love their misery better, And would scorn such good in ire!â It is strange, the unreasoned clinging Of the heart to its first woe, As 'twas made for that stern unionâ Thus fulfilled its fate below!â As 'twere made but for that portion, For that one dread doom and drear, And received its destined burthen With a welcome, though a fear! âMy sweet Daughter! mark'st thou yonder What a gallant train is seen?â Dost thou catch the inspiring visionâ To thy left but gently lean!â âHa! thou mark'st those Falconers gathered For their old romantic sport?â (Since they tell that great King Xerxes Followed such in camp and court! âWith the golden falcons blazoned On his proud empurpled vestâ And they tell Earth's earliest monarchs, Loved this chase inspiring best!)â With a wildered look and vacantâ Heard the Daughter then his speech, Which hovering struck her hearingâ Not her absent thoughts could reach! But she bowed her head all gentlyâ And she looked with such a lookâ As the old man, fond and anxiousâ Scarce could learn to bear and brook! Fast she rode on with her father To that gay and gallant troopâ And she saw the freed Hawks proudly Make their strong and venturous stoop. But for her the Hawks and Hunters, As they stirred the scene around, Might as well e'en have been painted On that sky, and on that ground!â All life to her was nothingâ In her deadly listlessnessâ What could please her? what could charm her? What could ever soothe or bless? And chagrined and disappointed, Did her Sire retrace his way, Nor more to his pale daughter Attempted then to say, But dismounting at their palace, Took her faint hand in his own, As he almost feared 'twas lifeless, And it was cold, cold as stone! Now the messengers returning, Have brought costliest presents backâ Surely these, so richly loaden, Have spoiled nations on their track! âLook on these fair Eastern treasures!ââ Cry her handmaids to that dame;â âHow they make all the air around them Shine ablaze with floods of flame!â Tripods, cressetsâcups and goblets, Each more precious than the lastâ And bright shells of dyes unnumberedâ At the Lady's feet were cast. And many-coloured carpets, From far Persia's skilful loom; And rare perfumes rich, and spiceries, Making odorous all the room! And ornaments so brilliantâ On an Emperor's marriage morn, Might his Bride wear such right proudly, Feeling such ne'er yet were worn!â (But vain to cure the sickness Of the immedicable heart Were those tributes of affection, Or to bid one pang depart!) âDearest Lady! prithee fasten Round thy forehead fair, these gems; Such methinks have never glistened In Imperial Diadems! âAnd this fire of Egypt mantle, Fold it round thy limbs, I prayâ For its very hue seems preciousâ 'Tis in sooth a Queen's array. âAnd this rare and dazzling girdle, Round thy waist one moment bind; Fear thou not that it will burn theeâ Though fire seems therein enshrined! âI must shade my eyes while settling Round thy form this flashing zone,â Cried the laughter-stirred handmaiden, Wishing these things were her own!â With her whole devout soul wishing She might claim so rich a prize, While she fixed on them with longing Thus her laughter-loving eyes!â Yet rejoicing to behold themâ These admiring one by one, As all eyes look charmed and gladdened At the universal Sun! And with thought to please her father, Staid the heart-struck maiden there; All without her was resplendence, All withinâthe dead despair!â How those violet veins meandering O'er her forehead start and swell!â Doth their labyrinth of blue beautyâ Of o'erwrought emotions tell! Round that sculpture-like smooth forehead, Now a starred tiara shinesâ Of carbuncles red and sparkling, And the out-glistering chalcedoines. And her wreathed hair of the death-black, By the contrast looked more dark; As the midnight frowns the murkier, Round the distant stars' clear spark. And her forehead looked more thoughtful, Blazoned out with all that lightâ Which flowed away intensely From those stones so broad and bright!â And her pale cheek looked the paler, Near those jewels' burning bloomâ Their deathless bloom of splendours, Flowering far in mines of gloom! Of the under Earthâthe Sunlessâ They are the everlasting flowersâ Something beautiful and lasting, Is in this world of ours! Round the waist of that sad virginâ Was the zone transcendent bound; Like a milky-way of glory, Glistering dazzlingly around! And her busy maidens robed her, In fair garments wrought and dyedâ 'Broidered silks of Alisaunder, The old word for Alexandria. Swept all sparkling there in pride!â To the ground they swept and loaded All that floor of marbles fine, With their gorgeous waves of beauty, Flowing down in varying line! Loops and links of gold and silver Fastened all her matchless dressâ But one ornament she wanted,â 'Twas the vanished happiness! Cloth of Tars was that rich drapery Which from her shoulders fellâ And her stomacher was loaded With more gems than I might tell. Now a shower of pearls oriental They display before her thereâ For which prize the sobbing divers Must have worked and struggled fair. So glorious, choice and splendid, Were those guerdons of their strifeâ Ah! perhaps each hard-gained trophy Might have cost an out-worn life!â And perchance on this she pondered, For she sighed so sore and deepâ 'Twas as though she felt the billowsâ In their wild and mastering sweep!â Was't revolving this she shuddered?â For she shuddering turned awayâ And the moon-white pearls up gathering, 'Gan the maids to talk and play. âNow, had I these pearls effulgent, For my future marriage-morn, I were then of maidens happiest, And the proudest ever born. âNay! our gentle Lady paleth!â Paler even than that hath been, Grows her cheek of childhood's smoothness;â Haste! and change the speech and scene! âLook! what other priceless treasures, For thy use and service free; Oh!âsweet Lady Lillia-Bianca, By thy Sire are brought for thee! âPerfumed woods, that shall in burning, Most delicious odours shed, And around a cloud of fragrance, With a depth voluptuous spread! âRare orfevreries and costliest!â The fairest e'er were seenâ Be certain they have issued From some farfamed magazine!â Yet ten thousand other presents Gave that Sire with fears and hopesâ Birds of Paradise' bright feathersâ Horns of fairy antelopes. Carven cabinets and curiousâ Formed of the elephant's fine toothâ Strange old reliques late-discoveredâ All things, thought can reach, in sooth!â And the aged, grey-haired Sire came trembling There to see if his dear child, By these dainty presents haply, Might be solaced and beguiled. The good old Man came dubiousâ Hoping fondlyâfearing muchâ And he paused thereâat the thresholdâ And that sight her heart did touch. With a desperate burst of anguish She received him then and thereâ Decked out in queenly trappingsâ Unimaginably fair!â And the Father motioning sadly All the astonish'd Maids awayâ Paused in breathless consternation, Seeking what he yet might say He had tried all kind condolenceâ All advice, all counsel tried; And he stood there in despondence, And his Heart within him died! But sheâthat mournful weeperâ In a shuddering voice and lowâ 'Gan to speak (while still thick-showering Down her blistering tear-drops flow!)â âThou art kind to me!âmy Father!â To thy pining, 'plaining child; And despite mine undeservingsâ Thou'rt for ever gracious-mild!â âOh! thy kindness, dearest Father, Is a bitterness to me; For I feel I mustâfor ever, Like a wretch ungrateful, be! âAnd besidesâOh!âwickedâwaywardâ Waywardâwicked as it isâ Still I feel thy love is bitterâ Oh! the impiety of this! âBecause he doth not love me, Seems all other love like hate!â And thy goodness and thy kindness Make my sufferings wax more great! âOh! a deep-dyed, lost offender, Now I feel I am become! But I wish for nothing earthly, Save the death-bedâsave the tomb! âI have poisoned all thy goodness By mine own envenomed moodâ Turned to wormwood all earth's sweetness, And its waters into blood! âI am all aweariedâwastedâ And a bitter cup have drunk! From the moment that I quaffed it All my soul within me sunk! âAnd all love to me is hateful, Since the love that I have lost; And my woe hath made me wicked, On its waves of wildness tossed!â But her Father nothing answered, For his grief too darkly stirs; And he mingled soon his weeping With those passionate floods of hers! Tears and sighs they sadly mingledâ Then with calmer voice she said:â âOh! dear Father!âdearest Father!â Bless'd be every drop you shed! âYou have given me costly presents, Won from many a distant land; In proud luxury of profusion Showered them round with liberal hand. âBut theseâthese are still the presents That my Soulâall melting wears!â Theseâthy love's most precious tributesâ Theseâthy sympathizing tears! âGive to grief no glittering gewgawsâ When the sun hath ceased to shine Can her eyes find aught resplendent?â Aught of gloriousâaught divine? âWhen the stars in heaven above us Seem so many trembling tearsâ Hath the earth one sparkling bauble That yet fair or bright appears? âNay!âbelieveâdisfurnished chambers, Unluxurious robes and plainâ Stern dull solitude and silence Were more soothing to my pain! âFor the splendour of the outward But contrasts too wilderingly With the inward, sleepless torture, And the unvarying misery!â Yet not thus that tender Father Could at once all hope resign; And he brought into her presence Travelled men and minstrels fine. These told her tales romanticâ Wondrous thingsâstrange, quaint, and wild;â But a year back she had listened Like a gladly wondering child! These sang her strains so artfulâ So delicate and dearâ That all earth appeared converted To a new, melodious sphere! All her thoughts had surelyâsurelyâ But a year, ere this year been Like to singing-birds, gay-carolling Those several strains between. But now they have no music, They are chill, drear mourners all; And a deeper, darker shadow Seems around the scene to fall! Yes!âher Thoughts of Love and Beauty, All like singing birds or shells, Had been made in days departedâ They are changedâto Funeral-knells. The Musicians and the Travellers Can win no wakening smile, From that lip of sheen and smoothnessâ Though its shape seems one the while! Its curve is still so lovelyâ Could that beauteous lip be made For aught but gentle smiling?â Sayâthou fair and gracious Maid! And her answer still is weepingâ Heavy weeping evermore! And she moaneth to her Father:â âHear me! hear! thou heardst before!â 'Gan her eyes to play like Fountainsâ 'Gan her breast to heave like Stormâ You might see the moving Misery Strive through all her quivering form. Those dark eyesâlike Fountains playingâ Lacked that smile, which, like Heaven's sun, Had turned all the drops to diamonds, Her translucent cheek upon! âTake me back to lovely Venice!â Though not lovely now to me!â I had rather in our Palace Find myself, once more and thee! âThough I scarce know why; for truly Seem all places even the same!â And they vary to my senses Now but only in their name! âAll the love for my fair birthplace Is dead within my heart; For that hath, in all creation, Now no interest and no part! âThe Love all Loves endearing Hath vanished from my way; And nothing but indifference In their empty room can stay! âAll the dearest feelingsâfriendshipsâ And the holiest, tenderest tiesâ That great Love was still endearing! It is death-struck!âand all dies! âWhy! my very Past, so radiant With sweet childhood's bloom and breath, Seems to me a flowerless desertâ All my past life, as a death! âSave where thouâfalse, false Leonardo!â Lit my path with love's delight!â All but that seems doom and darknessâ The desert and the blight! âThe Infelicities of Fortune Were all happiness to me!â So thatâlove-absolved Leonardo!â I had shared them all with thee! âI would well have borne all sufferance For thy dear and sovereign sake!â Unwearinglyâunmurmuringlyâ At wheelâor blockâor stake! â(How I sought thy looks for ever!â Yet such cowards were mine eyes, That still, each dear time they saw thee, 'Twas a shock of strange surpriseâ âThat whenever they were lifted To thine aspect, proud and bright, They were struck, as though by lightning, With a blindness of delight!) âAnd Father!âFather!âhear me!â I had rather suffer still, Than win childhood's free indifference 'Stead of this too mortal ill! âIf worse suffering could befall me, (Impossible though 'tis!â) I had rather brave and brook it, Than share any other bliss!â And they hied them back to Veniceâ Glorious Empress of the Seaâ The Beautiful!âthe all-powerful!â The far-renowned and free! âCome, Oh! Daughter!âfor the weather Is the loveliest ever seen, Of the Queen of Earth's Crowned Citiesâ Come thou forth, even like her Queen! âThy fair gondola is waitingâ Hark!âthe boatman's pleasing strain!â Come forth!âstately Lillia-Bianca! With thy gentle vestal train.â She came forth in silent sadnessâ In refulgent garments cladâ ('Twas to please her Father surely!â) She came forth all still and sad. Brow-bound with royal jewels, Which the sun's keen rays returned,â Like a costly conflagration Those transcendent jewels burned! She appeared in trance of silenceâ In full rich apparel clad;â And yestere'en she had seemed phrenziedâ Since full many a mood she had! Now she spoke with seeming anger, As though wroth with all she wereâ Now with miserable mildness Asking pity for her care!â Now with tones abrupt and hollow, As she struggled to repress Some signs of the inward trouble, And the outwearying restlessness. And now with air most queenly!â As though grief so touch'd with pride, That scarce with aught of earthly Moved she measured or allied! She leaned against the cushions, In that soft luxurious boatâ Like a leaf upon the waters This all silently doth float. Swarms of gondolas came near them, Wherein loveliest ladies sate, Well attended by young nobles, All of knightly strength and state. 'Twas a Festival in Venice!â All were gallant, proud, and gayâ For the Doge weds the Adriatic On this fair and cloudless day! Tens of thousands go in gladnessâ All these ceremonials fair To viewâand swell the triumph, And grace the joyaunce there!â Past the oars go dashing lightlyâ Lillia-Bianca doth not raise Her large eyes of deathlike darknessâ On the waves lies fixed her gaze! And when in scattered sparkles, Under some chance oar they dance, Then dissatisfied she seemethâ And doth something shift her glance! Now the blue, bright water shaketh To the sound of music loudâ Hark! the rolling drums, the clarionsâ Hark! the joyous, shouting crowd! 'Twas a blessed time for Veniceâ For great victories late were gained By that Mistress of the Ocean, Who so long had peerless reigned. And the Ottomites had suffered Under her puissant arm; And this lent the imposing Pageant Yet another loftier charm. Now the Doge, in all his greatness, Comes right proudly on the view! Now the Bucentaur is gilding All the water's quivering Blue! And liquid gold seems dashing 'Gainst the gorgeous Barque's bright sides! Thou mayst well look fair, Adriatic!â Queen of Queens and Bride of Brides! The âTe Deumâ is loudly chauntedâ And âKyrie Eleisonâ there! Still a nation's vast rejoicing Should ascend on wings of prayer! And the marriage ring is lowered, And the ceremonial's o'erâ And the shouting, gladdened people Seek again their palaced shore. In the wake of that proud Vessel, Which contained their Sovereign Chief, Followed fast that loving Father And that moveless Maid of grief! She had looked up never, neverâ From the time that she had pastâ From the broad steps to the Gondola Not once from first to last. Blazoned streamersâpompous draperiesâ All the pageantries and prideâ Of that scene of festal glory, On her uncharmed sense had died! She remarked not all that concourse Of the exultant people roundâ But gazed still on the azured waters, As her very looks were bound! She observed not those glad thousands, But her own sad mien retained, Gazing still on the outstretched waters, As her very looks were chained. Now they reached their palace threshold, Lo! a gondola shoots near, And a plumed chevalier whispereth Soft, a brief word in her ear. (Had you seen Pygmalion's Statue When it first was wakenedâwarmedâ When life's sudden-kindling current All its marble veins informedâ You had seen a sight resembling The mighty change that rushed O'er that Death-like Beauty's aspect, With an instant radiance flushed.) 'Twas the Doge's stately nephewâ And the chosen friend of one Who had brought the Eclipse and Tempest O'er that gentle heart undone! In his hand he held a letter, Which he offered to the maidâ And she dropped it in the watersâ So she shrank with doubt dismayed. Her trembling hand and faultering, Even as ice all dead and cold, Tried to grasp it, and retain itâ But it fell from that faint hold. In one moment more't was rescued, And straight given to her againâ Then the broad steps she ascended, Her closed chamber prompt to gain!â Left her there the watchful Father, While a hope inspired his breast, That the false and cruel Lover Was by late remorse oppressed. Long it wasâpoor pallid maidenâ Ere thy shaking death-cold handsâ Could undo the precious parchmentâ Could untwine the silken bands. When at last the missive's opened, How thy soul comes out to pore, Through thine eyes of tearful trouble, On these characters once more!â But a sick dismay o'ertakes her, On this threshold of her hope, And again her fluttering spirits, Like poor birds fresh-wounded droop!â No!â'tis not that well-known writing, As she hoped and she believed; Oh! then what can be the letter She so shudderingly received! From his friend's hand given, 'twas likelyâ It seemed certain this must be A dear letter from the Lover Who had caused her misery! It was traced in strange hand-writing, 'Twas in characters unknown; And she sate there mute and mournful, Half refrozen back to stone! Still gazing on the letter,â Till by slow degrees did melt, All the meaning to her bosom, Scarce she read itâbut she felt! And once more that changing aspect Showed a gladness of amazeâ Through her whole thrilled mind seem'd lightening Quick revivifying rays! Was no signature appended To that dark mysterious scroll!â Enough!âthat blessed writing Hath created her new soul! Life seems flashing like a torrent Through her long-lethargic veins; Yet with something too of sufferanceâ Every nerve and muscle strains! She is chokingâshe is stiflingâ With that o'er-informing floodâ That rushes wildly heart-ward, Of boundingâburning blood! So, when half-drowned men are rescued From the swallowing, boiling wave, They must feel the life-pang stealing Through their framesâthat pang shall save! She had now drank all the meaning Of that grasped and cherished scroll, With a fever-thirst of passion, To her deepestâinward soul!â She had gathered all the tidingsâ Piece by pieceâand part by part, Like so many separate treasures, To her own profoundest Heart,â And the long, long-banished crimson Is fast flooding o'er her cheek, In a flush of gorgeous glory, Where the rose-tints had been weak. Now she riseth and she paceth Up and down her chamber thereâ While the sweeping plumes and gem-knots, Yet adorn her dark wreathed hair! With the hurry of her movements, As she fluttereth to and fro, Of those thick braidsâsome fresh loosened, Down her shoulders wandering go. Their death blackness finely shadowing Those shoulders' sculptured snowâ With their undulating darkness, And uncurbed luxuriant flow. There was more than life and gladness In her countenance and mien, And she trod the earth triumphant, Like a Prophetess and Queen. She looked all an Inspirationâ Scarce you steadfastly might gaze!â Proud the plumes' triumphal waving, Bright the jewels' festal blaze!â Stay!âshe pauses!âmark!âshe faulters!â With a gracious pity nowâ She lifts that hand, transparentâ To her throbbing, burning brow. For her wrong'd and injured rival, She can gently sorrowing feel: For she knows the maddening miseries, Words may serve not to reveal. Away with words!âthe Unmakers Of our noblest thoughts are they!â We would speak our souls in fulnessâ And we change once more to clay!â Thoughts have come in Lightning-splendours! Through our souls they sweep in storms!â We are Gods in their great Silenceâ But we Speak!âand we are worms!â Away with words!âthe Unmakers Of our noblestâloftiest moodsâ The Spirit when least earth-touchedâ On itself in silence broods! Yet faultering words officiousâ At our lips still lie in waitâ To do their ill-done serviceâ And to bear their ill-borne freight. And thus did Lillia-Biancaâ Speak in broken speech and faintâ Her gentle voice still sounded Like the long-accustomed plaint. So modulated surely, To melodious tones of woe, In that same strain e'en in gladness, Still unconsciously 'twill flow! From her lips thus burstingâwandered The unpremeditated strain, Of power, and pride, and pleasure,â Of the battling Peaceâand Pain!â âI am glad!âyet whereforeâwherefore!â That his love hath ebbed from Her!â Oh! by grief long wrung, and outraged May my feverish judgments err! âHe may cease to love my rival; But, Oh! Heaven! he may not burn With the once-o'erpow'ring passionâ Nor to my scorned love return! âI have snatched with phrenzied hurry, At this Hope that gleamed to blessâ From the depths of such despairing Mad to glimpse such happiness! âI must struggle now to temper, And to govern and controul All these wild and whirling visions, And these workings of the soul! âBut I love thee!âOh! how madly, More than tongue inspired could tell; Let the searching Heaven above me But pronounce how wildly well. âThoughts of thee erewhile have shaken All my shivering shrinking frame, As 'twere even to dissolution, While the air I breathed was flame.â âAll my soul was desolationâ And the shadow of one fear, Which it shrunk fromâeverâeverâ Oh! the giant gloom and drear!â And she wrestled with her Gladness, As 'twere e'en another Grief; And she gained a bitter victory, In one little hour and brief. âAnd how could Iâsoon contented, Soon appeased, and soon beguiled, Throw away grave thoughts of injuryâ Like a vexed and straight-soothed child! âWoman's pride, and woman's honour, Other deeds and shows demandâ With a solemn voice imperious, Now, at the outraged Sufferer's hand.â And she struggled still and proudly, Till she rose up in her strength, From the whelming floods of Passion To a thoughtful Scorn at length!â Could she honour that frail Lover, Who, by double falsehood, now All his knighthood's fame had sullied, And had stained his princely brow! But her noble sire rejoicing, Saw the livelier colours play O'er her cheek and lip of freshnessâ And in nought would her gainsay! Days on days passed slowlyâvanishedâ And suspense grew sore and sick,â How whene'er she saw a letterâ Came her troubled breathings thick! At last a letter cometh From the false one, now afar,â 'Twas a prayerful letter, written By Leonardo del' Alvar!â And she read itâofttimes over, And devoured it in her heartâ And her soul bowed down to bless it,â And adore itâpart by part!â Human natureâWoman's nature, Could not this delight resist; She had borne pain's death-pangs lingering, 'Twas such rapture to exist!â For with Love alone seem'd coming True deep Life to heart and brainâ She had lingeredâshe had languishedâ Long in deathlike swoons of pain. But full swiftly she recovered From that fond and melting moodâ To her brow rushed soul and firmnessâ To her cheek the blaze of blood! âShall I not be now the avengeress?â Yes! a noble one, and brave; I will punishâwill chastise theeâ Then will pardon thee, and save. âI will wash from thy dimmed honour, Leonardo!âOh!âmy Love!â The stain that there remainethâ I will punish thee, and prove! âAnd I may not try thee lightly, Cruel Lover and false friend! I must try thee sore and sharply,â Mayst thou bear on to the end! âThen thy holy deep contrition May win grace for every wrong; Remorse and pain must chasten, Oneâfoul treachery stained so long! âYet may I not be despiteous!â I have loved thee, and I love!â All languageâand all showing, All dreams and deedsâabove! âI would kill thy faults and follies, To thy soul fresh life to give!â I would kill thy soul's distempersâ And save Love and Truth alive! âBlessed penitence shall lave thee Free from all thy faults at last; Heaven forgive, as I forgive thee, All the dire injurious past!â Now her confidential maiden, Ev'n the one she trusted most, Quick she called unto her presenceâ And did solemnly accost! âFiordilisa! yester even I did tell thee secret thingsâ And bade thee guard my treasure From Suspicion's wanderings! âNow I stand resolved and 'stablished In that purpose deep and dark; And 'tis thou must yield assistance!â Mind! my gentle maidâand mark! âFiordilisa! haste!âmy maiden! Make it seem that I am dead; Dress this image up in shroudings,â Be the webb of mourning spread!â âTo my dear, and thrice-dear Father, I will speed to gain consent, To that scheme I have imaginedâ On which all my Soul is bent.â To her Sire the Ladye goeth, And his dear consent she gains; While once more unto his bosom His own peerless child he strains! âI will guard thy mighty secret, But this pageant will give pain To this loving heart paternal,â I must feel, though I must feign. âThy mock funeralâdearest daughter!â I will carefully conductâ So that nothing shall thy wishes Spring to thwartâor chance to obstruct!â âBless my Father!âbless thy goodness!â Sobbed that softened Ladye forth; âNe'er yet lived there such dear Fatherâ Of all tenderness and worth!â âShould I find Leonardo troubled By contrition's gracious might, I shall shorten then his trialâ Shall speed on, his Soul's delight! âIf my mournful funeral tidings Should much agonize his heartâ I have given the solemn lesson!â I have done my painful part! âBut should chance he seem light-sorrowingly, These deathful news to hear, I will nurse the dark deception Till I make him feel and fear!â âTill with skilful hand I open All the gates of Love and Pain, So that all the Friend and Lover Yet may flow and live again!â âGive it out, then, Oh! my Father, That thy child is sick to deathâ And let men thus hear to-morrow Of thy Lillia-Bianca's death!â With kind blessings and embracings Then the old man let her goâ And she hied back to her chamber:â âFiordilisa!âthou'rt but slow!â âSpeed, Oh! speed thy preparations!â Our departure is at hand!â Through the corridors how sweetly Rang that clear voice of command! But none were within hearing, Save that confidential maid, All the others hitherâthitherâ Had been sentâtheir schemes to aid. âNow two pages in our seeming We will go forthâthis same night;â As our guard comes with us Marco; And the Saints guide all aright! âOn our way we must go darkly, E'en to look upon her faceâ Who hath been my haughty rivalâ Who hath wrought my sore disgrace! âYes! I mustâI must behold her, 'Tis a childish wish, perchanceâ But I feel I must look on her, If 'tis but one lightning glance! âI have dreamt of her for ever,â Bright with strange and Sorceress grace; Oh!âI mustâwhate'er betideth, Look on Theodelinda's face! âThen on, on, to Alvar quicklyâ To bear him tidings dark, Of my death, and of my burial; Nowâmy gentle Maiden!âmark!â And she takes two pages' garments, And straight one she giveth there, To the wondering Fiordilisa, That lovely maid and fair. âNow two pages in our seeming We will speed to theeâAlvar!â Thou'st forsaken Theodelindaâ Once thy changeful spirit's star!â To herself these words she muttered And she donn'd her page's dressâ And her brow is flushed with trouble, Of a dubious happiness!â âThou hast made two maidens wretched, And canst thou be happyâthou?ââ And the varying lights and shadows Still past fitful o'er her brow!â She hath brightened back to Beauty, Since her Lover's change of heartâ What rich eloquent suffusions To her cheek triumphant start!â She the sultry-souled and ardentâ She stood beautiful as Nightâ When ten thousand worlds of glory Make the shadowy Suzerain bright. Yet as fair as fervid Summer, When she melts o'er mount and plain, With a flush of royal rosesâ Dyed with Sunset's life-blood stain! âOh! my Father, vain and hopeless Were thy tenderest ministerings, Till the Dove, long sorely wounded, Found once more her heart and wings! âWhen to thee, returning fondly, Shall thy Lillia-Bianca come,â Oh! how beautiful with gladness Shall be then our mutual home! âAnd ifâif the Marriage garlands Should wreathe round my virgin browâ Still Oh! let me tend thee, Father! Ev'n till melts that dear head's snow!â âUp!ânow forward! Maidenâforward!â For I hear our coursers neigh; And awaits us stalworth Marcoâ Forward! forward!âwhile we may!â And old faithful Marco waiteth!â What a contrast doth he show To those two travestied Maidens, Then prepared with him to go! And old rugged Marco waiteth!â What a contrastâthen and thereâ He presents!âwhile, like a snow-storm, Floats his venerable hair! The Republic's veteran soldier, For âThe Lionâ he hath fought!â Like a tower of strengthâof ironâ Stands that hardy frame and haught! And their coursers were awaiting, And they mounted and rode on, Though steepy and circuitous Were the secret paths they won. For, afraid of recognition, Lillia-Bianca still with care Each frequented road avoided, And each public thoroughfare. âTrack that ledge of rock, though narrow! Let thy stirrup's grazing shock Dint the mountain-wall beside thee! Dangerous frowns this ride of rock! âQuick! now hurryâhurry!âmidnight Soon will veil your onward way!â Pauseâand let the page-clad pilgrims Now repose them as they may. It is morningâglorious morning, And she cometh in a flood! O'er the earth a Light-poured Delugeâ Bright as 'twere the red Sun's blood! âOh! I tremble!âFiordilisa!â I shall look upon that form, That had nigh wrecked all my fortunes In despair's on-sweeping storm!â Gently moved they onwardsâonwardsâ Through pleach'd rosariesâall sweet thorn!â Through deep thickets twined of myrtle To the Place of the Forlorn! There were walks all labyrinthine, And a hundred thick-trained bowers; And their footsteps fell most lightly, Where they passedâlike flowers o'er flowers!â Like to flower-leaves lightly scattered, So their noiseless footsteps fell, Till they came to a Pavilion, Where the Maid awhile did dwell. Then a smothered sound of wailing Came full softly on the ear; And paused there Lillia-Biancaâ As in sudden swoon of fear. Her companion gently motionedâ And some few steps she advanced; Then she paused again, bewildered,â And all troubled and entranced. In the midst of that Pavilion Sate a Lady deathly paleâ Her unbanded hair fell streaming Thick around her, like a veil. It was rich in lustrous beauty, And around her form did fling Its fair folds, as to enshroud her, Like some loving angel's wing! 'Twas her northern Mother's colouring Gave that hair's bright tints of gold; And her eyes were blue and beauteous, Although now in anguish rolled. âLet me speak to thy Distraction! Let me kneel to thy Despair!â Murmured gentlest Lillia-Bianca, Standing pity-melted there! Theodelinda raised in sadnessâ Now those blue-heaven eyes aboveâ And they looked as she demanded, E'en that hour to die for love! 'Twas with such a glance imploring, Searched her deep and dreaming eyesâ The speechlessâsealedâthe unopeningâ Oh! the unsympathizing Skies!â Then forth her burthened bosom Broke faint accents,âsad and deep! While she rocked herself as mothers Rock their wearied ones to sleep! âI was silentâI was breathlessâ When I heard my bitter doom; For I felt as 'twere the crushing Of some Mountain-ponderous Tomb! âAnd what were life and language? Ah! can they restore flown love? I have lost on earth my blessingâ I will seek it still above! âI am wretched as the Hopeless, Who have nothing left below But the dear and deadly treasure Of their Earth-o'ershadowing woe! âOr worse than all their sorrowsâ Worse than every pang besideâ The warm memory of their transport With redoubled beauty dyed! âLooking back to parted pleasureâ To a heaven our own no moreâ Makes it seem sevenfold a heavenâ Lights it thousand sweet times o'er! âAnd my memories are my madness, And they grow yet more distinct, As the Life-chain vainly lengthenedâ Softâis gradually unlinked. âImperceptibly, but surely Still unlinkedâso prays my Heart! It hath known Love's deepest triumphâ That hath perishedâlet it part! âOh! these words, so weakly clothing All my mighty worlds of woe! They are like the mists which coldly Round earth's Giant-features go. âWhat those mists are, in their faintness, To the solid world beneath, Are the words of this cold language To my Heart's great sphere of death! âHow I scorn, with utter scorning, How detestâloatheâlong and lateâ Ah!ânot thee!âUnworthiest Lover!â 'Tis myselfâmyself I hate! And her head sank faint and heavy On her alabaster arms; And the mantling hair fell round her, As to hide her mournful charms. And the sunbeams kissed those tresses Into lustres like their own! Ah! a gloomier, darker mantle Should around that form be thrown. There were sounds of heavy weeping, And she raised her stately head; For she thought her wail was echoed, And she hushed her cry in dread. Thou too hushed thy wailâthe bitterestâ Lillia-Biancaâloveliest Maid!â Whose gentle, loving spirit Was by pity all dismayed! âOh I knowâI know her anguishâ Every portionâevery part! I have had it here, and nursed it At mine own distracted Heart! âWith thy bitter voice of plaining My lament I well might blend; For that grief, to thee a Stranger, Is my long-familiar Friend! âAll thy burthen, deep and dreadful, I so utterly have known, That to me thy Soul, thus sorrowing, Seems to be my very own! âStill all spirits that are livingâ Which in dreariment may pineâ Unto meâtheir Sister-sorrow! Now should seem mine ownâe'en mine! âLeonardo!âfalse Leonardo!â What dark evil power thou hast won!â Two fond hearts of truth and feeling By thy falsehood faint undone! âAh! mine own I feel can never Be the joyous thing 'twas longâ Ere athwart its chords deep-thrilling, Passion's mighty wind rushed strong! âAnd ten thousand, thousand sorrows Racked its every pulse to painâ Oh! it never can be joyous As it was of yoreâagain! âThou hast murdered many a feeling, Once of lifeâdelicious part!â Thou hast murdered me in spiritâ Cold assassin of the Heart! âAnd the unhappiest Theodelinda, She must strive and struggle now With the agonies that blighted All my bosom and my brow!â âAh! my blood, in pride and anger, Should roll high, like waves of fire!â But upbraidings melt to blessings, When Love strives to speak in ire!â And they passed still onwardsâonwardsâ Those young travellers strange and rare! And they came at last in silence To the Lover's dwelling fair. They had undergone dread hardshipsâ 'Scaped from many a brigand band Ev'n with mickle pain and trouble! But, behold! the promised Land! They had fainted, all exhausted By fatigues unused and dire! But still nothing had o'ercome themâ Nor their fortitudeânor fire! And their faithful guideâold Marco!â Had with wondering gladness seen; This their noble, calm enduranceâ This their fortitude serene! But their perils now were over, And their penances and pain; At the lofty Lord's proud Mansion Now the weary three draw rein. They demanded straight an entrance, And an entrance straight obtained! (Lillia-Bianca faulteredâfaulteredâ But her 'stablished will remained!) These the marble flights ascended Of the arched statue-guarded stairs; Lillia-Bianca shudderedâshuddered, As o'ercome by old despairs! In the antechamberâfollowers Of the Count accosting herâ Whispered soon he would receive themâ How her creeping heart-strings stir! Every thought becomes a tempestâ All her silence is a storm!â While all quiv'ring with the anguish Bends that frail and fragile form! Every thought is made tempestuousâ She is bowed by doubt and shame! Seems that form of broken beauty, Flutteringâflickeringâlike a flame! Now broad valves of state, flung inward, Show Mosaic floors of pride! They are called to Alvar's presenceâ Lillia-Bianca's faint heart died! With a shock of strange amazement Then she heard the announcement given, As she had not come expresslyâ For this hourâtoiledâwatchedâand striven!â Lovelyâloveliest Lillia-Bianca!â How thou hast laboured and endured! How thy Miracles of Beauty Are by that strange guise obscured! Little now that garb revealeth Of the wonders of thy faceâ Of thine aspect's charm celestial, And thy slight form's willowy grace. On her head a cap of velvet Comes low down upon her brow; And a long, long drooping feather Shadoweth those sweet features now. The wild rain and wind have beaten That long feather o'er her face; And scarce one lovely feature Of the seeming page you trace. The ample cloak of deepest sable Falls, wrapp'd thick in many a fold Around that shrinking figure,â Full in heavy draperies rolled. And from head to foot clad darkly, In the deepest mourning, stand Those two youthful pages, either With a letter in their hand. (Like some night-black Ethiopian, With a lovely soul and fair, Stood each dark-disguised young Maiden, In Eclipse of Beauty there. Beneath their frowning garments Each was fair as snowdrops white, Like some death-black Ethiopian, With a lovely soul and bright!) From these he takes the letters, Notes the garbs of solemn woe; And then marks these strange despatchesâ Are wrapped round with sable too. With a most apparent trouble Doth he ope the first-given scroll; And a cry of thrilling anguish Bursts as forth a parting soul! It was answered by another As fearful, sharp, and shrill; Then all was gloom and silence,â Stood the sable couriers still. Too much occupied with suffering Was Leonardo to remark How his shriek of woe was echoedâ All withoutâwithinâwas dark! One more momentâhe hath started Like a Maniac to his feet, With dark hair dashed back all wildly, While his threatening eyebrows meet! âHow is this?â he fiercely thundered, With ferocious glance and wild. âHow is this?â himself he echoed, With a faultering tone and mild. First his startling speech he thundered, With outrageous strength and wild; Then repeated it as gently As a grieved or frightened child! âLillia-Bianca!âLillia-Bianca!â Have I murdered thee indeed! Then of pity and of pardon None like me have bitter need. âThou wert beautiful as morning, And how full of faith and love!â My martyred one!âmy murdered!â Oh! my sorely-stricken Dove! âOne look of dear forgiveness From thy mild imploring eye! One single glance of pity!â And how gladly would I die!â âOh! but let me haste and soothe him!â Whispered Lillia-Bianca lowâ âOh! but let me fly and tell him All 'twill make his bliss to know! âThousand, thousand times I have suffered More than thou hast done!âmine own! And to see thee bowed in sorrowâ 'Tis an anguish yet unknown! âO! but let me fly with comfort!â And she struggles where she stands; For Fiordilisa grasps her With gentle-violent hands. âNay! nay!â murmureth Fiordilisa, âThis wild fit may soon pass o'er! Nay! 'twere best awhile you waitedâ Wait, thenâwait to hear yet more!â Smothering half that agitationâ Suffering all that maddening painâ Did the softened Lillia-Bianca In that desperate strait remain! Her breath was now but gaspingâ Quivered painfully her formâ All her soul was a convulsion! All her stillnessâwas a storm!â A stormâconcentredâprisoned In that slight and fragile frame! All the Seas of Soul were tossing, Yet she stood there still the same! From her cold lips hissed a whisper Of great agony and fear:â âOh! but must I stand unaiding, And see all his tortures here?â âAll his tortures may be passing, All his sorrow may be brief! Oh! then wait a little longer, And observe his phrenzied grief!â Now his manly face was buried In his robes, and in his hands; When once more it was uplifted, There ye tracedâFate's stern commands,â Fate's stern commands and sentenceâ As they had been stamped an age On that countenance so torturedâ On that livid living page. A change had o'er his aspect With terrific mystery gone; And he looked like one for ever, And for evermore undone!â Even his very features alteredâ Marredâcrushedâhorribly appearedâ And within the Conscience burningâ Hath the outward semblance seared!â Not alone the Conscience maddened Then that grief-distracted mindâ Every memory of affection Pierced with thousand pangs refined! In such hours man surely liveth CenturiesâCenturies of despairâ And the o'er wounded heart is working With a giant's great strength there!â The heart!âthat mighty Labourer, Or for Evilâor for Goodâ Who its legions of wild feeling And deep powersâhath e'er withstood? It can build up worlds at pleasure, If its pulses' play be free;â Or can crush down all creation To Chaotic Agony. The heart!âthe unuttered mysteryâ Mighty thus in weakness e'en!â It can stamp its own dread image On this universal Scene! Yes!âit well can make Creation Chaos of all agonies!â And the heart of him who struggleth, There in griefâself-rule defies!â (He can sway not those wild pulsesâ That plunge deep into their painâ As to know the worst of miseryâ Were to taste some bliss again!) On itselfâitself revengingâ Still all the evil it hath doneâ With a luxury of abhorrence Never yet to others shown!â A luxury of inhuman, Most unnatural hatred thereâ Full displayed, that never, neverâ Man could give for other's share! On itself the heartâgrown desperateâ Thus will exercise in pride, Such excess of indignation, As 'twould show to none beside. All his face seems now convulsion, While drops faint his powerless handâ Beaded thick along his forehead Clammy drops of suffering stand!â âLillia-Bianca! Lillia Bianca!â Best and brightest One!âfarewell!â In thy Virgin grave of sorrowâ Thou wilt softly slumbering dwell!â âThou art buried in thy beauty, Thou art buried in thy bloom: Would that on my heart was pressing Now thy ponderous marble tomb! âAll my thoughts are tossingâtossing, Like a thousand waves of fire; I am stunned and o'er bewilderedâ Do I feel, and still respire!â âIs this life still that inhabits This accursed and blasted form?â Oh! thou dust of death and ruinâ Take the vainly-writhing worm!â âSo! one comfort still remaineth; Oneâyet, one shall be mine own!â Whispered Fiordilisaâshudderingâ âHasteâspeak!âspeak!ââin faultering tone. âNay, he thinks of Theodelindaâ I may scarce approach him yet!â While her streaming eyes she strainethâ While her gaze on him is set! âOh!â'tis thus he dreams of comfort!ââ Scarce the words were said, when lo!â All her soul was up in horror, For she sawâshe felt a blow!â A blow at his loved bosomâ Swiftâright suddenâsharp and strongâ And a stream of blood reeked flowing To her rooted feet along!â Well the poniard's point was sharpened, Well it answered to his call! What a shriek rushed up to Heaven-throne While she sawâheardâfelt that fall! What a curdling exclamation Ploughed its way through soul and heart!â At that shockâthe life-uprootingâ Seemed her very voice to start! All her soul was in the madness Of strange agony abroadâ Something, somethingâthere hath happenedâ What?âher mind refused the load! âLillia-Bianca! Lillia-Bianca! Is't thy form?âmy faint brain errs!ââ First these sounds came!âthen all silence!â And the rest was Death's!ânot Hers. âLillia-Bianca!âLillia Bianca! Is't then Death's? and is't not Thine? Oh! thy soul winged fast on anguish, Followingâfollowingâmurmured âmine!ââ There's a band of black-robed mourners, In the streets of Venice fairâ Dost thou lie at last in slumber, Young, pale Daughter of Despair! On the mountain-heights of anguish, Longâthou stoodstâtoo longâalone, And to thee the grave of sorrow Must be dearer than a throne! Divorced wert thou from gladness, And from tenderness and hopeâ And SunlessâStarlessâJoyless, Looked ev'n Heaven's ethereal cope!â And in vainâOh! hapless Father, Were thy tenderest ministeringsâ Couldst thou give the Dove heart-wounded Yet once more her blessed wings!â But wingsâstrong wings were given her!â She hath fled in peace awayâ From the poison of Life's pleasuresâ And the midnight of its day! Lillia-BiancaâLillia-Bianca!â The unimaginably Bright!â For thee was the earth for ever But a desert and a night!â Lillia-Bianca!âLillia-Bianca!â Thou wert bowed by sufferings sore; One most mighty Grief rose darkening All thy glad youth deeply o'er!â All that Earth could give and Nature, At thy Virgin feet was thrown; Yet Love destined thee to sorrowâ And but sorrow was thine own!â THE END.</field>
