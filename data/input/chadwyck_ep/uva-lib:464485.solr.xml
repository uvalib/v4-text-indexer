Her bi-genneþ of þe kyng of Tars And of þe soudan of Dammas, Hou þe soudan of Dammas Was I-cristned þoru godus gras. 1 Herkneþ to me, boþe eld &amp; ?ing, For Maries loue, þat swete þing, Al hou a wer bigan Bitvene a trewe cristen king &amp; an heþen heye lording, Of Dames þe soudan! Þe king of Tars hadde a wiue, Feirer mi?t non ben oliue, Þat ani wi?t telle can; A douhter þai hadde hem bitven, Non feirer woman mi?t ben, As white as feþer of swan. 2 Þe meiden wasschast &amp; bliþe of chere, Wiþ rode red so blosme on brere &amp; ey?en stepe &amp; gray, Wiþ lowe scholders &amp; white swere; Hir for to sen was gret preier Of princes proud in play. Þe los of hir gan spring wide In oþer londes bi ich a side, So þe soudan hert it say. Him þou?t, his hert, it brast ofiue Bot ?if he mi?t haue hir to wiue, Þat was so feir a may. 3 His messangers he gan calle &amp; bad hem wi?tly wenden alle To hir fader þe king, &amp; seyd, he wald, hou so it bifalle, His douhter cloþe in riche palle &amp; spouse hir wiþ his ring, &amp; ?if he nold, wiþ outen feyl, He wald hir win in batayl Wiþ mani an heye lording.

Þe messangers herd him þus seyn, Wiþ þat word þai turned o?ain &amp; to þe soudan þai went. 8 As þe soudan sat at his des, Yserued of þe first mes, Þai com in to þe halle Bi for þo princes prout in pres, Her tale to telle, wiþ outen les, On knes þai gun doun falle. Þai seyd: “Sir, þe king of Tars Of wicked wordes is nou?t scars, Heþen hounde he gan þe calle; &amp; ar he ?iue his douhter þe tille, Þine hert blod he will spille &amp; þine barouns alle.” 9 When þe soudan þis wordes herd, Also a wilde bore he ferd, His robe he rent adoun; His here he rent of heued &amp; berd, He schuld venge him wiþ his swerd, He swore bi seyn Mahoun. Þe table so heteliche he smot, It fel in to þe flore fot hot, &amp; loked as a lyoun; Al þat he rau?t, he smot doun ri?t, Seriaunt, squier, clerk &amp; kni?t, Boþe erl &amp; baroun. 10 Al þus þe soudan ferd, y pli?t, Al þat day &amp; alle þat ni?t, Noman mi?t him schast; A morwe, when it was li?t, His messangers he sent ful ri?t For his barouns wel fast, Þat þai com to his parlement, For to heren his iugement, Boþe lest &amp; mast; When þe parlement was pleyner, Þo bi-spak þe soudan fer &amp; seyd to hem in hast: 11 “Lordinges”, he seyd, “what to red? Me haþ ben don a gret misdede: Of Tars þe cristen king, Y bede him boþe lond &amp; lede For his douhter worþliche in wede, To han wed hir wiþ ring, &amp; he me sent word ogain, In bateyl y schuld arst be sleyn &amp; mani an heye lording; &amp;, certes, he schal be for-sworn, Wroþer hele þan was he born, Bot y þer to it bring. 12 &amp; þer fore ich haue after ?ou sent &amp; asembled here þis parlement, To wite ?our conseyle.” &amp; alle þai seyd wiþ gode entent, Þai were at his comandment, Certeyn, wiþ outen feile.

Þer he hadde þe soudan slawe, Ac ten þousend of heþen lawe Saued him in þat were; Þai sett him on a ful gode stede, Þat was so gode at eueri nede, Þat noman mi?t him dere. 17 &amp; when he was opon his stede, Him þou?t, he brend so spark on glede For ire &amp; for envie; He fau?t so he wald wede, Alle þat he hit, he maked blede; “Help, Mahoun!” he gan crie. Mani helme þer was of-weued &amp; mani bacinet to-cleued &amp; sadles fel emtye; Mani swerd &amp; mani scheld &amp; mani kni?t lay in þe feld Of cristen compeynie. 18 Þe king of Tars seye him so ride, He fleye, &amp; durst nou?t abide, Homward to his cite; Þe Sarrazins folwed in þat tide &amp; slou? adoun bi ich a side Þat cristen folk so fre.

Þe king of Tars bitven hem rod &amp; Lessias strok he abod, As y finde in mi sawe, &amp; smot him so on þe scheld, Þat top ouer teyl in þe feld He made him ouer-þrawe. 95 He lepe on hors &amp; gan to ride, &amp; slou? adoun bi ich a side Þat he bi for him founde; Wham þat Lesias hit in þat tide, Were he douk or prince o pride, He ?af him dedly wounde. Þe king of Tars com wiþ a spere &amp; þurch his sides he gan it bere, Þat ded he fel to grounde; Þan sett þe Sarrazins vp a cri: “A, Mahoun, ful of meistri, Help ous in þis stounde!” 96 When king Carmel herd, þat him was wo, To fihten anon he was ful þro, A spere an hond he hent; He priked his stede &amp; dede him go, He þou?t þe king of Tars to slo, Er he þennes went. He smot þe king of Tars þat tide Þurch his hauberk a wounde wide, Þat nei?e he hadde him schent; Þe king out of his sadel fel, Þe blod out of his wounde gan wel, Þat mani man him bi-ment. 97 For sorwe þe soudan wald wede, When he sei?e his woundes blede, He rode to him wiþ mayn; He and þe cristen ferred Brou?t þe king of Tars his stede &amp; sett him vp o-gayn. &amp; when he was on hors brau?t, Alle þat euer he arau?t, He clef him to þe brayn.
