      <field name="fulltext">[The abuse of the blessed Sacrament of the Aultare The preface to the reader. Good readers all, of eche degre To you I make, humble request When that you do this reade or se To iudge my minde vnto the best And blame me not, though I ernest be In this hige point of our fayth Which now, so many enmyes hath. All thinges, sayeth Paull, that written be Are written playne for our learnyng Then syth inscripture thus we se That Christe to vs was so louinge Not onely death for vs sufferinge But also lefte vs his flesh and bloude Of bodye and soule to be the foode Namely to suche as worthely Receyue it with a fayeth perfete That Christ is ther soule and bodye Whom the Iewes slewe wyth greate despyte Without which fayeth as I resyte They do receyue it damnably Not deserninge oure Lordes bodie Good reader muse not on this thynge How by thy reason it shoulde be For that in errour will the bringe Yf thou by reason seeke to se Howe God can worke this misterie Canst thou vyle dust at thys ceason Measure Gods worke by thy reason Thou art man, but a creature Wylt thou with thy maker contend Howe he can worke at his pleasure Aboue that thou canst comprehend He hath made the vnto suche ende That thou by fayth, to him shoulde cleaue Aboue reason, for to beleue Therfore I do, the aduertyse Thy reason ther, to captyuate It is no reasons exercyse With, howe, to knowe the perfyte rate Howe God doth worke, in this estate Therfore agayn to the I saye Thou oughtest him in fayth to obey Thus ende I now my preface Desieringe you good readers all The perfyte fayth for to embrace The whych is most catholicall And if in this answere you shall Fynd any faute, I it commyt To such as can, truely mende it. FINIS Of late a new balad came to my hand Compyled by a false christen man As it is easye for to vnderst?de In y? so madly he doth y? thinge scan Whiche he reproueth, but here after wh? Ye do reace the answere it shal apeare What deuilishe doctrine he hath written here And because hys errour shalbe sene playn. Eche staff of hys tyme I wyl answere so That then he shall haue no cause to c?playne For all hys hole prosesse as it doeth go I wyll wryt forth and not adde one worde mo In than swere wherof, he shall se euident How wyckedlye hys tyme in it he hath spent And nowe for hys matter to enter in As after foloweth it doeth begin. The ballade. What meaneth this gyse, I woulde faine here Straunge sightes in my eies, there do apere Defended wyth lies, boeth farre and nere Greate ruth it is, What this m? doeth meane is here stra?ge to me For if he be christened then dare I say That that thinge which he maketh so stra?ge to be Syth he, he came to reason euery day The sacrament he sawe honoure alwaye But if he be a panym, than truely I blame hym not muche for his greate outcrye. The balad Ise men honour, Both breade and wyne For christ our sauiour, which he left for a sign To the beleuer, Of hys death deuyne Lorde amende thys Whoeuer hearde beaste so shamefully ly, No Christen man doth honour breade or wine For nether kynds be there thoughe to our eye They do so apere, yet fayeth doth defyne Christe hole to be ther by hys power deuine To whom the godhede is knit there Ioyntlye Whome we are bounde to honoure of dewtye The Ballad. Wonderful syghtes, I coulde declare I loked in the pixte Dome gods I sawe there Made of the priests, Which sinners are Liuinge amyse. Wonderfull it is vnto a pagane How a pure virgyn shoulde bring forth a child But easye it is to a Christian man Which hath this, how from his reasone exilde Obeyinge to fayeth on which he doeth bylde So if this man woulde reasone captiuate He shoulde not ieste after thys folishe rate Dome gods it pleaseth thys wretch them to cal The hostes he meaneth which are consecrate Because they speake not nor be sene vital Ergo, they be dome: o beaste intoxicate Yf Christe coulde be sene ther after that rate That he walked here, wher were th? thy faith Wher eye, may perswade, faith hath no merite The ballade. Fr? sinners seperate, Gods son is, saith Paul Hygher then heauen seate, Aboue y? powers al How w? sinful hand make, His body then you shall Syr prists tell me thys Truth it is that christe is vp ascended How can sinful hands then make him say you Who euer so sayde or that defended Truely none, nor at thys tyme doth nowe But thys trueth all christen men doeth auowe That after the wordes of God ther spoken Christes fleshe is ther that for vs was broken The balad Thou sayest by thy coninge that y? makest him Who hath made of nothyng Both y? &amp; thi kyn Heauen earth and al thynge, conteined ther in What lye is thys A great lye surely of your owne makinge Ye can do it well as here doth appere It semyth that the diuil dyd kepe you waking That so shamefull wil lye wythout fere His serua?te you are whose badge ye do beat The whych is lyeng, and our Lorde doth saye That the diuell is father to lyers alwaye The Ballad. Thou wylt say with spede, It is not our acte The worde in this ded, taketh effecte Wyth the I prosede, that thus dooste obiecte Answere me to this The priestes that do say it is not our acte But god by the word is worker of all They that so hath sayd no true iugem?t lacke For so it is as after proue I shal The priest by authority spiritual But as a minister doth execute And god his creature doth ther transmute The Ballade. What word hast y? noddy, Wherwith Christ did make Of bread his body, As y? dost crake Wyth all thy studye, An answere take And tell me this. Without great studye thanswer is made Me thynke ye presume very hye This is my body Christ playnely sayde You dare be so bolde to saye he doth lye Not so syr, say you that worde say not I Yet doth your wordes proue, syr bi your lic?ce That to Christes wordes ye geue no credence. The ballad. Hoc est corpus Meum, you bryng Wher wyth ye clocke vs, Under your wynge But for your purpose, It serueth nothynge Who seyth not thys? Hoc est corpus meum fyrste Christe in brought And to all hys apostels gaue the power As ministers to do, that him selfe wrought By the wordes spoken to them at that houre Which wordes are str?ger then castel or towr And so shall enduer vnto the laste daye When all gods enemies shal vanyshe awaye The ballad. To be the worde, Naimely of giuing Which christ our Lord, Spake to his beleueing Disciples at borde, as they were sitting Their faith to encrease Christe promest his disciples before That the bread that he would geue to them al Was his fleshe which he for euermore Would giue for the life of al men mortal Firste, at his maundy by power supernal He fulfilled his promise geuing than truely To them his owne pure natural bodie Secondly Christe on the crosse him selfe gaue In his one bodi as he walked here And so suffred ther al man kinde to saue But at his maundy as it dyd apere He gaue the same body, but this in minde bere Not as on the crosse, rightely to define But vnder the forme of pure bread and wine The ballad. He is but a beast, knowyng ryght nought Which saith that hoc est, Are wordes to make ought Thys is manyfest, In a wyse mans thought Wher knowledge is. He is but a beast I maye saye ryght wel Whiche wyll saye that God who is almighty In sayeinge, thys is, dyd not truely tell That, that he coulde do, but rather did lye What beast is he this, that dare playne deny Yf god say, this is, it is not so sayeth he Because reason wyll not ther to agre What and if God wylde a thynge done to be Aboue course of nature and yet god woulde That m? shoulde do it thoughe no word had he But onely a deede as Moyses olde God bade him lay downe the rode he dyd hold Whiche when he had done it was a serpente Then taking it by the tayl as is told Yt turned to a rodde euen continent God sayde to Moyses this shoulde be y? sygne To declare his power before kyng Pharao The whiche after he dyd by the power deuyne Wythout anye word that scripture doth show This doth your hygh reas? cleane ouer throw That, hoc est, can not be words to make ought Much more th? no wordes, ye wil say I trow Chiefly being spoken by hym that al wrought Yea spoken by hym, that I graunte saye you Well, that obiection I wyll deferre now The ballad If, I say to the, This is my head It must so be, Before I so sayde Or els with a lye, I haue the fed Understandest thou thys. Ye for soth syr, but nowe if ye should tel Thys to a dome beast the? durst I depose That he coulde skantly vnderst?de you well For he can nether iuge, head, eye, nor nose But tell thys to a man, and I supose He would thynke you to be ful dronke or mad To point him to knowe his legge fr? his hose For he would thinke in y? he ful knowlege had But nowe my knowlege may me here begile For may hape, ye be a man of grauite And therfore agayne I wyl turne my style And wyl speake to you in thys thinge sadly By your example ye meane ful madly That christ pointed to his bodie natural What scripture haue ye I would know gladli That christe ment not ther of the breade at all Yf in the scripture that wyll not be founde To beleue your fancie I am not bounde Mary, your example your part√© trew to trye Sayth if christ ment not so, he made a false lye The ballad. Wel th? to say lo, Thys is my body Hath not made it so, Thou seyst w? smal studie Wherfore shortely go, Make other wordes redi These wyl do no seruice. Here lo ye triumphe like a noble syer As though ye had proued al that ye speak Which is that our sauioure christe was a lier Wh? that he dyd say wh? he bread did breake This is my body, his power was to weake He coulde not performe that he there dyd saye He muste seeke other wordes that to conuaye. The ballade. What if in scripture, Were wrytten one lyne Wherwith our sauiour, Thy god and myne Into thys nature, Dyd tourne bread and wine Couldest thou do thys? What if in scripture ther be one lyne As ther is in dede whiche I before tel To proue that our Lorde both thy god &amp; myne Dyd consecrate hys body fleshe and fell Agaynste them which chiefely ye do repel Naye, amyte, say you that Christ did so do Coulde you mayster parsone do the same to Ye for soth syr, Christe dyd that for oure sake And not for thapostles at that tyme alone For priestes for that purpose then he dyd make Geuynge power to them al euerie one To consecrate hys body wh? he was gone Sayenge do thys, in my remembraunce Which to this day hath had continuance Ye I graunte say you that the Lorde dyd saye Do thys in mi commemoracion Then is it no more that well se ye maye But a remembraunce of christes passion It is lefte for a remembraunce I knowe And yet christes true body as I wyl showe The pascal lambe offred in the old law Was of christes offeringe an onelye figure The rocke of stone out of which y? Iewes saw Water flowynge out, for them cleene and pure Which stone figured christe as saith scripture Then yf the sacrament be now no more But a fygure onely, then these before Were as good then as is the sacrament But christ was a prieste muche more excellente Which made amendes for our transgression Leauynge his sacrament of suche perfection That wher as the other were figures onely Hys is both a fygure and also truly The same thynge that is figured therby The whiche is christes naturall body Thys to beleue I thynke ye wyll refuse Ye wil rather leaue christ, and folow y? Iewes Sayeng how can this felowe gyue to vs Hys fleshe to eate, it doth seme, ye do thus The ballad. Thou hast the word, wherwyth god wrought Man beast fish burd, And all of nought Canst thou good bloud, Therwith makeought That vnmade is. We haue the same word I do playne confesse And for al your gay talke so do not ye The word whiche as saint Iohn doth expresse Was the second person in trinitie Without wh? ther was nothing mad saith he By no wordes writen it was that he ment But by his sonne, one with him in deitie Which is with vs nowe in the sacrament Yet happly here ye will to me obiect And wil aske me if Moyses did not write The veri wordes which by god toke effect In createinge of man as he did resite Yesse say I, wel then say you gone is quite Al your hole matter which ye do defend Excepte y? your priestes wil stoutly stande byte That they by y? word c? worke to y? same end Wel hit forsoth and spoken lyke a clarke Ye make as though ye walke in the light But like one through blind ye walke in y? dark For whom that in scripture hath any syght Maye sone se that ye take not scripture righte God made al this world we se of nothing Doth it folowe y? man can not by gods myght Turn thinges fr? ther nature, god being wiling Now what gods wil is in the Sacrament I haue tolde you before by his wordes playne In the which the priest is but an instrument For y? wordes y? christ spake he spakes againe As christ him self bad, which was not in vaine For after the wordes our Lord by hys power Creates nothyng newe there that is certayne The ballad Yf w? that scripture. Thou canst not make The least creature, How wylt thou take On thy weake nature, Of bread to create The Lorde of blysse. Ye thinke al proued that ye onely, saye And yet to saye trueth ye do but contend By reason to kepe your fayth at a bay Chargeinge men with that they do not defend If we sayd that a makyng dyd depend Of the priest or of god whiche we deny Th? had ye some cause your time thus to sp?d Christ is ther but howe we seke not to spy Therfore leaue of your folish blasphemy It is agaynst our fayth catholyke and trewe That euer christ shoulde be create anewe. The ballad Hauinge no word, of consecracion Wherof the Lord, hath mad relacion Thou teachest abrode thine owne inuencion Which is amise Who is more blind then those that wil not se What botes it to shew you any scripture Syth to no part therof ye wil agre Which to your reasone is harde or obscure But yet once a gayne to do you pleasure Ye shall heare if Christ made no relacion In scripture of the consecracion Christ to his disiples these wordes dyd saye I longe to eate the pascall lambe sayth he Wyth you my disciples for nowe is the day Of the swete bread, I praye you note and se Howe the trueth wyth the figure doth a gre Christe was the true lambe which y? prophetes saw Shuld truly fullfyl the Moysaical law Christe eat the lambe ther as the law did will Then to showe that that law was expired He ordaynde his lawe, that lawe, to fulfil Which whil y? world lasts shal not be finished That l?be was him self which he ordained To be offred dayly in rem?braunce Of his bitter death and paynfull suffraunce Note here I praye you one thinge by the waye Christ sayd I long to eate with you this daye The passouer, by which he did declare What great loue euer towardes them he bare Which was not only the lawe to fulfil But also to show them more of his wil Which was that he woulde gyue vnto th? all The perfite pledge of the life eternal Performing his promise made to them before By geuing them his fleshe for euer more Among them so to be comunicate That therby they shulde be incorporate In hym than, and he in al them also What greater loue coulde he to his people sho But yet with this loue our lorde dyd not cease For in his moste payne his loue did encrease Remembring man kind sayde, Sitio Not onely for drinke, but mans health also, Yt was that our Lord dyd then so sore thruste Se how this word both agre with the furste I long (sayeth christe) to eate the pascal w? you On the crosse, I thrust, in which I note nowe That by these true wordes christe doth signifi The desire that he had to geue his body Accordinge to his promyse saying thus. The breade that I wyll geue playne to discuse Is my flesh, here lo, was his fyrst promise And at his maundy he fullfilled thys Under forme of breade he dyd it ther giue With spirit &amp; lyfe wherby al such shoulde liue As dyd receyue it by fayth worthily On the crosse also he gaue his body To suffer painfully he was there erecte Thus ye se that as christ dyd saye, I thurst So dyd he before that he at the furste gaue himself (said I l?g) which words proueth to me the furst body &amp; the last both one to be Christ at his last supper as I before saye Toke bread and blessed it and brake it truly Gaue ye to his disciples and without stay Bad them take and eate this is my body Then to shew them what body he ment, truely He added these wordes to those he had spoken Saieng, which for your sinnes shalbe broken What body was broken for our trespas? No signe of a body I thinke ye wyl saye But euen the same body which borne was Of the virgin mary, voyd this if ye may Then toke christ y? cup, bleste it the same waye As before saing: this is my bloud truely Which shalbe shed for the synnes of many What bloud did christe shedde for our sakes I thinke ye wyll saye his bloud natural This agaynst your errours very much makes Which to a voyde be able ye neuer shal Then christe had them do this in his memorial What (this) was it that he bade them do Was it not to blesse, to breake, and to geue to And to speake the same words y? he ther spake When he the bread into his hand did take Which wordes were the words of c?secraci? And then bad that on the same facion His apostles shuld do, nowe thus ye se That the true wordes of consecracion be In scripture, though you those wordes skan To be but only thenuencion of man Yet one worde of Christe to mind here I call Christ to declare that the law moisaical He wolde hole fulfyl for the which intente He toke the cup &amp; sayed these wordes euidente This is my bloud in the newe testament Syggnifieng that the olde lawe was spent With al the bloud of beastes which did figure The bloud of Christ aboue al blods most pure Now marke th?, if y? wh? christ did playn say This is my blud, shuld meane none other way But in figure only, what were it more Then the figures of the olde law before Nor yet so much nether if ye marke wel For in the olde lawe as I before tel Uery bloud to figure, christes bloude truly They did offer, vpon the which thinge I Gather that and if the wyne be wyne still That Christe at supper did the lawe fulfyll Wyth a figure of bloud, which cannot be For a figure is fulfilled we do se In the veritie and not in figure Chefly in thys thyng ye wyl graunt I am sure This holy sacrament god did fore se A great comforte for all his people to be For whych he ordeyned a priest and kyng The same trueth to figure in his offering Christ is a priest sayeth Paul after the order Of Melchisedech, now note here further Melchesedech was both a priest and king So was christes also as recordeth writtinge Melchesedech was a king and yet truly No mencion is made of his progeny Which doth signifie that christ was a kynge His father vnknowe without beginning Melchesedech was kinge as scripture sayth Of Salem, which as saynt paul plainely hath To the Hebrwes that, that doth signifi A kyng of peace, to whome he dyd applye Christe our sauiour and ye besyde this Melchesedech of Christ a figure is In this pristhode, for as scripture doth saye He brought forth to Abraham in the waye Bread &amp; wine, In which acte scriptture doeth him call The priest of y? most hie god eternal Christ likewise gaue y? formes of bread &amp; wine Of which Melchsedech was but a signe Here may hap one thing ye wyl aske of me Wher saynte Paul doth note them thus to agre For nether y? prophet ther nor S. Paul Of breade or wine speakes not one word at all But doth Melchedechs priesthod applye Unto christe when that he moste painfully Dyd offer vp his fleshe and bloude most pure Unto his father this is playn scripture All this is true, I wyl it not denye. Yet for my purpose agayne to replie To Melchesedech, note here that he cam Forth with breade and wyne to mere Abrah? Giuing thankes to God for his victori Which to his pristhod perteined truly Then that being his order howe can ye Dinie christe of the same order to be Sith vnder the kyndes of breade and wyne he Gaue his body, this in scripture we se And though s. Paul do no bread or wine name Doth he deny Christes priesthode in the same? Nay forsoth for as of Christ is spoken He gaue the body which is broken For our synnes at his last supper ye knowe And then what though s. Paul nothyng show Of bread and wyne, yet their priesthodes agre So much the more, if this well noted be Melchesedech dyd not offer wyth bloud And yet dyd he fygure Christes presthod When he on the crosse offered his bodye Unto his father with his woundes bloudye Howe shoulde that be &amp; no bread or wine there Yesse forsoth the scripture wyll it wel beare Syth Christ gaue hys bodye as I before saye Under those fourmes because thei shuld alwai Remember his death by that sacrament. Which death the breade &amp; wyne did represent That Melchesedech offred, here ye se Howe both their priesthodes herein do agre For Melchesedechs order dyd attend Unto Christes offring on the crosse at the ende Which offring ther done was done once for al To be offred so, agayne he neuer shall. The Ballad. For Christ hath sayd Thou c?st not shape One heare of thy heade, whyte ether blacke. How c?st thou of bread, Th? gods s?ne make whyche in heauen is. Thys stafe I haue answerd playnly before For styl ye be harping vpon one stryng Therfore to thys I wyl answere nomore But pray vnto god that he wyll you brynge Out of your errour, but thys is one thynge Except ye beleue as sayth Esay. Ye cannot vnderstand thys hye mystery The ballad A better mynde. The Lorde graunt the That thou mayst fynd, hys verite which maketh the blind, In soule to se what hys wyll is. I pray God gyue syght to those that be blind Then trust I to se your conuersion For none is ther blynder that I can fynd Then you bee in youre mad opinion All other people ye can crye vpon That to beleue scripture they shuld agre And none farther fr? it then you your selfe be The Ballad. God graunt the, the part, Of s. Paule to playe I meane to conuert, From the Romyshe way And with a meke herte, Gods truth to obaye Who graunt the this. Your praier dependeth of a godly intent Which is that ye woulde haue al men forsake There catholyke fayth in the Sacrament And your errour in the place thereof to take But nowe for your part the better to make Ye call the truth Romyshe as though that we Had receiued it of the popyshe see The ballad Lord gra?t that our head, king Edward y? sixt May bury that dead God which is pixte And get in his stead, thy supper not mixte With abuse popishe. Lord gra?t that king Edward which ouer vs hath The chief primacie vnder christe Iesu Truely to defend the catholike fayth Which from the apostles dyd hole ensew And all heresy and popishnesse to subdwe That we may liue vnder his highnes so In the catholyke fayth which is most true that to y? honour of god al thinges may grow I wonder much how ye durst be so bolde As to pray so for the kinges maiestie That his highnes shoulde do as ye haue tolde A deed before god of grate iniquitie Which is that the dead god pixte he may bury Ye show your selfe a true subicte in this Which doth point your king to such an office. The ballad That we may espie In that signe and token Wyth spirituall eie, Thy body broken And thy bloud plentiously Shed as is spoken To bringe vs to blesse. Who wold thinke, lo, but that thys man ment well Seing that he wyshith that we may al Se christes death ther, for so sayeth the gospel But yet marke hym wel and perceiue ye shall That vnder the name of this worde spiritual As his Ballad before doth playne expresse And here a signe and token he doth it cal Takyng it for nomore hymselfe doth wytnes But the catholyke fayth perfect and true. Is, we must beleue that in the sacrament Is not onely a sygne wher in we must vewe The death of christe with a godly intent But also that christe himselfe is present Fleshe and bloud, but how that he shuld be Reason cannot teach, therfore he must consent Unto fayth, and then he shal it truely se Nowe thus of this answere I make an ende Prayenge god his greace to vs both to sende.
