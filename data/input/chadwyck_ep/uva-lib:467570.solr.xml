[Stay, ruby-breasted warbler, stay] TuneââJulia to the Wood-Robin.â Stay, ruby-breasted warbler, stay, And let me see thy sparkling eye, Oh brush not yet the pearl-strung spray Nor bow thy pretty head to fly. Stay while I tell thee, fluttering thing, That thou of love an emblem art, Yes! patient plume thy little wing, Whilst I my thoughts to thee impart. When summer nights the dews bestow, And summer suns enrich the day, Thy notes the blossoms charm to blow, Each opes delighted at thy lay. So when in youth the eye's dark glance Speaks pleasure from its circle bright, The tones of love our joys enhance And make superior each delight. And when bleak storms resistless rove, And every rural bliss destroy, Nought comforts then the leafless grove But thy soft noteâits only joyâ E'en so the words of love beguile When Pleasure's tree no flower bears, And draw a soft endearing smile Amid the gloom of grief and tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POSTHUMOUS AND FUGITIVE POEMS ON DEATH I Can death be sleep, when life is but a dream, And scenes of bliss pass as a phantom by? The transient pleasures as a vision seem, And yet we think the greatest pain's to die. II How strange it is that man on earth should roam, And lead a life of woe, but not forsake His rugged path; nor dare he view alone His future doom which is but to awake. WOMEN, WINE, AND SNUFF Give me women, wine and snuff Until I cry out âhold, enough You may do so sans objection Till the day of resurrection; For bless my beard they aye shall be My beloved Trinity. FILL FOR ME A BRIMMING BOWL Fill for me a brimming bowl And let me in it drown my soul: But put therein some drug, designed To Banish Women from my mind: For I want not the stream inspiring That fills the mind withâfond desiring, But I want as deep a draught As e'er from Lethe's wave was quaff'd; From my despairing heart to charm The Image of the fairest form That e'er my reveling eyes beheld, That e'er my wandering fancy spell'd. In vain! away I cannot chace The melting softness of that face, The beaminess of those bright eyes, That breastâearth's only Paradise. My sight will never more be blest; For all I see has lost its zest: Nor with delight can I explore The Classic page, or Muse's lore. Had she but known how beat my heart, And with one smile reliev'd its smart I should have felt a sweet relief, I should have felt âthe joy of grief.â Yet as the Tuscan mid the snow Of Lapland thinks on sweet Arno, Even so for ever shall she be The Halo of my Memory. Aug. 1814. SONNET ON PEACE O Peace! and dost thou with thy presence bless The dwellings of this war-surrounded Isle; Soothing with placid brow our late distress, Making the triple kingdom brightly smile? Joyful I hail thy presence; and I hail The sweet companions that await on thee; Complete my joyâlet not my first wish fail, Let the sweet mountain nymph thy favourite be, With England's happiness proclaim Europa's Liberty. O Europe! let not sceptred tyrants see That thou must shelter in thy former state; Keep thy chains burst, and boldly say thou art free; Give thy kings lawâleave not uncurbed the great; So with the horrors past thou'lt win thy happier fate! SONNET TO BYRON Byron! how sweetly sad thy melody! Attuning still the soul to tenderness, As if soft Pity, with unusual stress, Had touch'd her plaintive lute, and thou, being by, Hadst caught the tones, nor suffer'd them to die. O'ershadowing sorrow doth not make thee less Delightful: thou thy griefs dost dress With a bright halo, shining beamily, As when a cloud the golden moon doth veil, Its sides are ting'd with a resplendent glow, Through the dark robe oft amber rays prevail, And like fair veins in sable marble flow; Still warble, dying swan! still tell the tale, The enchanting tale, the tale of pleasing woe. SONNET TO CHATTERTON O Chatterton! how very sad thy fate! Dear child of sorrowâson of misery! How soon the film of death obscur'd that eye, Whence Genius mildly flash'd, and high debate. How soon that voice, majestic and elate, Melted in dying numbers! Oh! how nigh Was night to thy fair morning. Thou didst die A half-blown flow'ret which cold blasts amate. But this is past: thou art among the stars Of highest Heaven: to the rolling spheres Thou sweetly singest: naught thy hymning mars, Above the ingrate world and human fears. On earth the good man base detraction bars From thy fair name, and waters it with tears. SONNET TO SPENSER Spenser! a jealous honourer of thine, A forester deep in thy midmost trees, Did last eve ask my promise to refine Some English that might strive thine ear to please. But Elfin Poet 'tis impossible For an inhabitant of wintry earth To rise like PhÅbus with a golden quell Fire-wing'd and make a morning in his mirth. It is impossible to escape from toil O' the sudden and receive thy spiriting: The flower must drink the nature of the soil Before it can put forth its blossoming: Be with me in the summer days and I Will for thine honour and his pleasure try. ODE TO APOLLO I In thy western halls of gold When thou sittest in thy state, Bards, that erst sublimely told Heroic deeds, and sang of fate, With fervour seize their adamantine lyres, Whose chords are solid rays, and twinkle radiant fires. II Here Homer with his nervous arms Strikes the twanging harp of war, And even the western splendour warms, While the trumpets sound afar: But, what creates the most intense surprise, His soul looks out through renovated eyes. III Then, through thy Temple wide, melodious swells The sweet majestic tone of Maro's lyre: The soul delighted on each accent dwells,â Enraptur'd dwells,ânot daring to respire, The while he tells of grief around a funeral pyre. IV 'Tis awful silence then again; Expectant stand the spheres; Breathless the laurell'd peers, Nor move, till ends the lofty strain, Nor move till Milton's tuneful thunders cease, And leave once more the ravish'd heavens in peace. V Thou biddest Shakspeare wave his hand, And quickly forward spring The Passionsâa terrific bandâ And each vibrates the string That with its tyrant temper best accords, While from their Master's lips pour forth the inspiring words. VI A silver trumpet Spenser blows, And, as its martial notes to silence flee, From a virgin chorus flows A hymn in praise of spotless Chastity. 'Tis still! Wild warblings from the Ãolian lyre Enchantment softly breathe, and tremblingly expire. VII Next thy Tasso's ardent numbers Float along the pleased air, Calling youth from idle slumbers, Rousing them from Pleasure's lair:â Then o'er the strings his fingers gently move, And melt the soul to pity and to love. VIII But when Thou joinest with the Nine, And all the powers of song combine, We listen here on earth: The dying tones that fill the air, And charm the ear of evening fair, From thee, great God of Bards, receive their heavenly birth. SONNET TO A YOUNG LADY WHO SENT ME A LAUREL CROWN Fresh morning gusts have blown away all fear From my glad bosom,ânow from gloominess I mount for everânot an atom less Than the proud laurel shall content my bier. No! by the eternal stars! or why sit here In the Sun's eye, and 'gainst my temples press Apollo's very leaves, woven to bless By thy white fingers and thy spirit clear. Lo! who dares say, âDo this?â Who dares call down My will from its high purpose? Who say, âStand,â Or âGo?â This mighty moment I would frown On abject CÃ¦sarsânot the stoutest band Of mailed heroes should tear off my crown: Yet would I kneel and kiss thy gentle hand! HYMN TO APOLLO I God of the golden bow, And of the golden lyre, And of the golden hair, And of the golden fire, Charioteer Of the patient year, Whereâwhere slept thine ire, When like a blank idiot I put on thy wreath, Thy laurel, thy glory, The light of thy story, Or was I a wormâtoo low crawling, for death? O Delphic Apollo! II The Thunderer grasp'd and grasp'd, The Thunderer frown'd and frown'd; The eagle's feathery mane For wrath became stiffen'dâthe sound Of breeding thunder Went drowsily under, Muttering to be unbound. O why didst thou pity, and for a worm Why touch thy soft lute Till the thunder was mute, Why was not I crush'dâsuch a pitiful germ? O Delphic Apollo! III The Pleiades were up, Watching the silent air; The seeds and roots in the Earth Were swelling for summer fare; The Ocean, its neighbour, Was at its old labour, When, whoâwho did dare To tie, like a madman, thy plant round his brow, And grin and look proudly, And blaspheme so loudly, And live for that honour, to stoop to thee now? O Delphic Apollo! SONNET [As from the darkening gloom a silver dove] As from the darkening gloom a silver dove Upsoars, and darts into the Eastern light, On pinions that naught moves but pure delight, So fled thy soul into the realms above, Regions of peace and everlasting love; Where happy spirits, crown'd with circlets bright Of starry beam, and gloriously bedight, Taste the high joy none but the blest can prove. There thou or joinest the immortal quire In melodies that even Heaven fair Fill with superior bliss, or, at desire Of the omnipotent Father, cleavest the air On holy message sentâWhat pleasures higher? Wherefore does any grief our joy impair? STANZAS TO MISS WYLIE I O come Georgiana! the rose is full blown, The riches of Flora are lavishly strown, The air is all softness, and crystal the streams, The West is resplendently clothed in beams. II O come! let us haste to the freshening shades, The quaintly carv'd seats, and the opening glades; Where the faeries are chanting their evening hymns, And in the last sun-beam the sylph lightly swims. III And when thou art weary I'll find thee a bed, Of mosses and flowers to pillow thy head: And there Georgiana I'll sit at thy feet, While my story of love I enraptur'd repeat. IV So fondly I'll breathe, and so softly I'll sigh, Thou wilt think that some amorous Zephyr is nigh: Yet noâas I breathe I will press thy fair knee, And then thou wilt know that the sigh comes from me. V Ah! why dearest girl should we lose all these blisses? That mortal's a fool who such happiness misses: So smile acquiescence, and give me thy hand, With love-looking eyes, and with voice sweetly bland. SONNET [Oh! how I love, on a fair summer's eve] Oh! how I love, on a fair summer's eve, When streams of light pour down the golden west, And on the balmy zephyrs tranquil rest The silver clouds, farâfar away to leave All meaner thoughts, and take a sweet reprieve From little cares; to find, with easy quest, A fragrant wild, with Nature's beauty drest, And there into delight my soul deceive. There warm my breast with patriotic lore, Musing on Milton's fateâon Sydney's bierâ Till their stern forms before my mind arise: Perhaps on wing of Poesy upsoar, Full often dropping a delicious tear, When some melodious sorrow spells mine eyes. SONNET [Before he went to feed with owls and bats] Before he went to feed with owls and bats Nebuchadnezzar had an ugly dream, Worse than an Hus'if's when she thinks her cream Made a Naumachia for mice and rats. So scared, he sent for that âGood King of Catsâ Young Daniel, who soon did pluck away the beam From out his eye, and said he did not deem The sceptre worth a strawâhis Cushions old door-mats. A horrid nightmare similar somewhat Of late has haunted a most motley crew, Most loggerheads and Chapmenâwe are told That any Daniel tho' he be a sot Can make the lying lips turn pale of hue By belching out âye are that head of Gold.â SONNET WRITTEN IN DISGUST OF VULGAR SUPERSTITION The church bells toll a melancholy round, Calling the people to some other prayers, Some other gloominess, more dreadful cares, More hearkening to the sermon's horrid sound. Surely the mind of man is closely bound In some black spell; seeing that each one tears Himself from fireside joys, and Lydian airs, And converse high of those with glory crown'd. Still, still they toll, and I should feel a damp,â A chill as from a tomb, did I not know That they are dying like an outburnt lamp; That 'tis their sighing, wailing ere they go Into oblivion;âthat fresh flowers will grow, And many glories of immortal stamp. SONNET [After dark vapors have oppress'd our plains] After dark vapors have oppress'd our plains For a long dreary season, comes a day Born of the gentle South, and clears away From the sick heavens all unseemly stains. The anxious month, relieved of its pains, Takes as a long-lost right the feel of May; The eyelids with the passing coolness play Like rose leaves with the drip of Summer rains. The calmest thoughts come round us; as of leaves Buddingâfruit ripening in stillnessâAutumn suns Smiling at eve upon the quiet sheavesâ Sweet Sappho's cheekâa smiling infant's breathâ The gradual sand that through an hour-glass runsâ A woodland rivuletâa Poet's death. SONNET [This pleasant tale is like a little copse] [Written at the end of âThe Floure and the Lefeâ] This pleasant tale is like a little copse: The honied lines do freshly interlace To keep the reader in so sweet a place, So that he here and there full-hearted stops; And oftentimes he feels the dewy drops Come cool and suddenly against his face, And by the wandering melody may trace Which way the tender-legged linnet hops. Oh! what a power hath white Simplicity! What mighty power has this gentle story! I that for ever feel athirst for glory Could at this moment be content to lie Meekly upon the grass, as those whose sobbings Were heard of none beside the mournful robins. TWO SONNETS I TO HAYDON, WITH A SONNET WRITTEN ON SEEING THE ELGIN MARBLES Haydon! forgive me that I cannot speak Definitively on these mighty things; Forgive me that I have not Eagle's wingsâ That what I want I know not where to seek: And think that I would not be over meek In rolling out upfollow'd thunderings, Even to the steep of Heliconian springs, Were I of ample strength for such a freakâ Think too, that all those numbers should be thine; Whose else? In this who touch thy vesture's hem? For when men star'd at what was most divine With browless idiotismâo'erwise phlegmâ Thou hadst beheld the Hesperean shine Of their star in the East, and gone to worship them. II ON SEEING THE ELGIN MARBLES My spirit is too weakâmortality Weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep, And each imagin'd pinnacle and steep Of godlike hardship, tells me I must die Like a sick Eagle looking at the sky. Yet 'tis a gentle luxury to weep That I have not the cloudy winds to keep, Fresh for the opening of the morning's eye. Such dim-conceived glories of the brain Bring round the heart an undescribable feud; So do these wonders a most dizzy pain, That mingles Grecian grandeur with the rude Wasting of old Timeâwith a billowy mainâ A sunâa shadow of a magnitude. SONNET ON A PICTURE OF LEANDER Come hither all sweet maidens soberly, Down-looking aye, and with a chasten'd light, Hid in the fringes of your eyelids white, And meekly let your fair hands joined be, As if so gentle that ye could not see, Untouch'd, a victim of your beauty bright, Sinking away to his young spirit's night,â Sinking bewilder'd 'mid the dreary sea: 'Tis young Leander toiling to his death; Nigh swooning, he doth purse his weary lips For Hero's cheek, and smiles against her smile. O horrid dream! see how his body dips Dead-heavy; arms and shoulders gleam awhile: He's gone; up bubbles all his amorous breath! TO ? I Think not of it, sweet one, so;â Give it not a tear; Sigh thou mayst, and bid it go Any, any where. II Do not look so sad, sweet one,â Sad and fadingly; Shed one drop, then it is gone, O 'twas born to die. III Still so pale? then dearest weep; Weep, I'll count the tears, And each one shall be a bliss For thee in after years. IV Brighter has it left thine eyes Than a sunny rill; And thy whispering melodies Are tenderer still. V Yetâas all things mourn awhile At fleeting blisses, Let us too! but be our dirge A dirge of kisses. LINES [Unfelt, unheard, unseen] I Unfelt, unheard, unseen, I've left my little queen, Her languid arms in silver slumber lying: Ah! through their nestling touch, Whoâwho could tell how much There is for madnessâcruel, or complying? II Those faery lids how sleek! Those lips how moist!âthey speak, In ripest quiet, shadows of sweet sounds: Into my fancy's ear Melting a burden dear, How âLove doth know no fullness nor no bounds.â III True!âtender monitors! I bend unto your laws: This sweetest day for dalliance was born! So, without more ado, I'll feel my heaven anew, For all the blushing of the hasty morn. SONNET ON THE SEA It keeps eternal whisperings around Desolate shores, and with its mighty swell Gluts twice ten thousand Caverns, till the spell Of Hecate leaves them their old shadowy sound. Often 'tis in such gentle temper found, That scarcely will the very smallest shell Be mov'd for days from where it sometime fell, When last the winds of Heaven were unbound. Oh ye! who have your eye-balls vex'd and tir'd, Feast them upon the wideness of the Sea; Oh ye! whose ears are dinn'd with uproar rude, Or fed too much with cloying melodyâ Sit ye near some old Cavern's Mouth, and brood Until ye start, as if the sea-nymphs quir'd! SONNET ON LEIGH HUNT'S POEM âTHE STORY OF RIMINIâ Who loves to peer up at the morning sun, With half-shut eyes and comfortable cheek, Let him, with this sweet tale, full often seek For meadows where the little rivers run; Who loves to linger with that brightest one Of HeavenâHesperusâlet him lowly speak These numbers to the night, and starlight meek, Or moon, if that her hunting be begun. He who knows these delights, and too is prone To moralize upon a smile or tear, Will find at once a region of his own, A bower for his spirit, and will steer To alleys where the fir-tree drops its cone, Where robins hop, and fallen leaves are sear. ON OXFORD A PARODY I The Gothic looks solemn, The plain Doric column Supports an old Bishop and Crosier; The mouldering arch, Shaded o'er by a larch Stands next door to Wilson the Hosier. II VicÃ¨âthat is, by turns,â O'er pale faces mourns The black tassell'd trencher and common hat; The Chantry boy sings, The Steeple-bell rings, And as for the Chancellorâdominat. III There are plenty of trees, And plenty of ease, And plenty of fat deer for Parsons; And when it is venison, Short is the benison,â Then each on a leg or thigh fastens. THE POET A FRAGMENT Where's the Poet? show him! show him, Muses nine! that I may know him! 'Tis the man who with a man Is an equal, be he King, Or poorest of the beggar-clan, Or any other wondrous thing A man may be 'twixt ape and Plato; 'Tis the man who with a bird, Wren or Eagle, finds his way to All its instincts; he hath heard The Lion's roaring, and can tell What his horny throat expresseth, And to him the Tiger's yell Comes articulate and presseth On his ear like mother-tongue. MODERN LOVE And what is love? It is a doll dress'd up For idleness to cosset, nurse, and dandle; A thing of soft misnomers, so divine That silly youth doth think to make itself Divine by loving, and so goes on Yawning and doting a whole summer long, Till Miss's comb is made a pearl tiara, And common Wellingtons turn Romeo boots; Then Cleopatra lives at number seven, And Antony resides in Brunswick Square. Fools! if some passions high have warm'd the world, If Queens and Soldiers have play'd deep for hearts, It is no reason why such agonies Should be more common than the growth of weeds. Fools! make me whole again that weighty pearl The Queen of Egypt melted, and I'll say That ye may love in spite of beaver hats. A SONG OF OPPOSITES âUnder the flag Of each his faction, they to battle bring Their embryon atoms.â âMilton. Welcome joy, and welcome sorrow, Lethe's weed and Hermes' feather; Come to-day, and come to-morrow, I do love you both together! I love to mark sad faces in fair weather; And hear a merry laugh amid the thunder; Fair and foul I love together. Meadows sweet where flames are under, And a giggle at a wonder; Visage sage at pantomime; Funeral, and steeple-chime; Infant playing with a skull; Morning fair, and shipwreck'd hull; Nightshade with the woodbine kissing; Serpents in red roses hissing; Cleopatra regal-dress'd With the aspic at her breast; Dancing music, music sad, Both together, sane and mad; Muses bright and muses pale; Sombre Saturn, Momus hale;â Laugh and sigh, and laugh again; Oh the sweetness of the pain! Muses bright, and muses pale, Bare your faces of the veil; Let me see; and let me write Of the day, and of the nightâ Both together:âlet me slake All my thirst for sweet heart-ache! Let my bower be of yew, Interwreath'd with myrtles new; Pines and lime-trees full in bloom, And my couch a low grass-tomb. SONNET TO A CAT Cat! who hast pass'd thy grand climacteric, How many mice and rats hast in thy days Destroy'd?âHow many tit bits stolen? Gaze With those bright languid segments green, and prick Those velvet earsâbut pr'ythee do not stick Thy latent talons in meâand upraise Thy gentle mewâand tell me all thy frays Of fish and mice, and rats and tender chick. Nay, look not down, nor lick thy dainty wristsâ For all the wheezy asthma,âand for all Thy tail's tip is nick'd offâand though the fists Of many a maid have given thee many a maul, Still is that fur as soft as when the lists In youth thou enter'dst on glass bottled wall. LINES ON SEEING A LOCK OF MILTON'S HAIR Chief of organic numbers! Old Scholar of the Spheres! Thy spirit never slumbers, But rolls about our ears, For ever, and for ever! O what a mad endeavour Worketh he, Who to thy sacred and ennobled hearse Would offer a burnt sacrifice of verse And melody. How heavenward thou soundest, Live Temple of sweet noise, And Discord unconfoundest, Giving Delight new joys, And Pleasure nobler pinions! O, where are thy dominions? Lend thine ear To a young Delian oath,âaye, by thy soul, By all that from thy mortal lips did roll, And by the kernel of thine earthly love, Beauty, in things on earth, and things above I swear! When every childish fashion Has vanish'd from my rhyme, Will I, grey-gone in passion, Leave to an after-time, Hymning and harmony Of thee, and of thy works, and of thy life; But vain is now the burning and the strife, Pangs are in vain, until I grow high-rife With old Philosophy, And mad with glimpses of futurity! For many years my offering must be hush'd; When I do speak, I'll think upon this hour, Because I feel my forehead hot and flush'd, Even at the simplest vassal of thy power,â A lock of thy bright hair,â Sudden it came, And I was startled, when I caught thy name Coupled so unaware; Yet, at the moment, temperate was my blood. I thought I had beheld it from the flood. SONNET ON SITTING DOWN TO READ KING LEAR ONCE AGAIN O golden tongued Romance, with serene lute! Fair plumed Syren, Queen of far-away! Leave melodizing on this wintry day, Shut up thine olden pages, and be mute: Adieu! for, once again, the fierce dispute Betwixt damnation and impassion'd clay Must I burn through; once more humbly assay The bitter-sweet of this Shakespearian fruit: Chief Poet! and ye clouds of Albion, Begetters of our deep eternal theme! When through the old oak Forest I am gone, Let me not wander in a barren dream, But, when I am consumed in the fire, Give me new PhÅnix wings to fly at my desire. SONNET [When I have fears that I may cease to be] When I have fears that I may cease to be Before my pen has glean'd my teeming brain, Before high-piled books, in charactery, Hold like rich garners the full ripen'd grain; When I behold, upon the night's starr'd face, Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance, And think that I may never live to trace Their shadows, with the magic hand of chance; And when I feel, fair creature of an hour, That I shall never look upon thee more, Never have relish in the faery power Of unreflecting love;âthen on the shore Of the wide world I stand alone, and think Till love and fame to nothingness do sink. SHARING EVE'S APPLE I O blush not so! O blush not so! Or I shall think you knowing; And if you smile the blushing while, Then maidenheads are going. II There's a blush for won't, and a blush for shan't, And a blush for having done it: There's a blush for thought and a blush for naught, And a blush for just begun it. III O sigh not so! O sigh not so! For it sounds of Eve's sweet pippin; By these loosen'd lips you have tasted the pips And fought in an amorous nipping. IV Will you play once more at nice-cut-core, For it only will last our youth out, And we have the prime of the kissing time, We have not one sweet tooth out. V There's a sigh for yes, and a sigh for no, And a sigh for I can't bear it! O what can be done, shall we stay or run? O cut the sweet apple and share it! A DRAUGHT OF SUNSHINE Hence Burgundy, Claret, and Port, Away with old Hock and Madeira, Too earthly ye are for my sport; There's a beverage brighter and clearer. Instead of a pitiful rummer, My wine overbrims a whole summer; My bowl is the sky, And I drink at my eye, Till I feel in the brain A Delphian painâ Then follow, my Caius! then follow: On the green of the hill We will drink our fill Of golden sunshine, Till our brains intertwine With the glory and grace of Apollo! God of the Meridian, And of the East and West, To thee my soul is flown, And my body is earthward press'd.â It is an awful mission, A terrible division; And leaves a gulph austere To be fill'd with worldly fear. Aye, when the soul is fled To high above our head, Affrighted do we gaze After its airy maze, As doth a mother wild, When her young infant child Is in an eagle's clawsâ And is not this the cause Of madness?âGod of Song, Thou bearest me along Through sights I scarce can bear: O let me, let me share With the hot lyre and thee, The staid Philosophy. Temper my lonely hours, And let me see thy bowers More unalarm'd! SONNET TO THE NILE Son of the old moon-mountains African! Chief of the Pyramid and Crocodile! We call thee fruitful, and, that very while, A desert fills our seeing's inward span; Nurse of swart nations since the world began, Art thou so fruitful? or dost thou beguile Such men to honour thee, who, worn with toil, Rest for a space 'twixt Cairo and Decan? O may dark fancies err! they surely do; 'Tis ignorance that makes a barren waste Of all beyond itself, thou dost bedew Green rushes like our rivers, and dost taste The pleasant sun-rise, green isles hast thou too, And to the sea as happily dost haste. SONNET TO A LADY SEEN FOR A FEW MOMENTS AT VAUXHALL Time's sea hath been five years at its slow ebb, Long hours have to and fro let creep the sand, Since I was tangled in thy beauty's web, And snared by the ungloving of thine hand. And yet I never look on midnight sky, But I behold thine eyes' well memory'd light; I cannot look upon the rose's dye, But to thy cheek my soul doth take its flight. I cannot look on any budding flower, But my fond ear, in fancy at thy lips And hearkening for a love-sound, doth devour Its sweets in the wrong sense:âThou dost eclipse Every delight with sweet remembering, And grief unto my darling joys dost bring. SONNET WRITTEN IN ANSWER TO A SONNET ENDING THUS:â Dark eyes are dearer far Than those that mock the hyacinthine bellâ By J. H. Reynolds. Blue! 'Tis the life of heaven,âthe domain Of Cynthia,âthe wide palace of the sun,â The tent of Hesperus, and all his train,â The bosomer of clouds, gold, grey and dun. Blue! 'Tis the life of waters:âOcean And all its vassal streams, pools numberless, May rage, and foam, and fret, but never can Subside, if not to dark blue nativeness. Blue! Gentle cousin of the forest-green, Married to green in all the sweetest flowers,â Forget-me-not,âthe Blue bell,âand, that Queen Of secrecy, the Violet: what strange powers Hast thou, as a mere shadow! But how great, When in an Eye thou art, alive with fate! SONNET TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS O that a week could be an age, and we Felt parting and warm meeting every week, Then one poor year a thousand years would be, The flush of welcome ever on the cheek: So could we live long life in little space, So time itself would be annihilate, So a day's journey in oblivious haze To serve our joys would lengthen and dilate. O to arrive each Monday morn from Ind! To land each Tuesday from the rich Levant! In little time a host of joys to bind, And keep our souls in one eternal pant! This morn, my friend, and yester-evening taught Me how to harbour such a happy thought. WHAT THE THRUSH SAID LINES FROM A LETTER TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS O thou whose face hath felt the Winter's wind, Whose eye has seen the snow-clouds hung in mist, And the black elm tops 'mong the freezing stars, To thee the spring will be a harvest-time. O thou, whose only book has been the light Of supreme darkness which thou feddest on Night after night when PhÅbus was away, To thee the Spring shall be a triple morn. O fret not after knowledgeâI have none, And yet my song comes native with the warmth. O fret not after knowledgeâI have none, And yet the Evening listens. He who saddens At thought of idleness cannot be idle, And he's awake who thinks himself asleep. SONNET THE HUMAN SEASONS Four seasons fill the measure of the year; There are four seasons in the mind of man: He has his lusty Spring, when fancy clear Takes in all beauty with an easy span: He has his Summer, when luxuriously Spring's honied cud of youthful thought he loves To ruminate, and by such dreaming nigh His nearest unto heaven: quiet coves His soul has in its Autumn, when his wings He furleth close; contented so to look On mists in idlenessâto let fair things Pass by unheeded as a threshold brook. He has his Winter too of pale misfeature, Or else he would forego his mortal nature. EXTRACTS FROM AN OPERA [O! were I one of the Olympian twelve] O! were I one of the Olympian twelve, Their godships should pass this into a law,â That when a man doth set himself in toil After some beauty veiled far away, Each step he took should make his lady's hand More soft, more white, and her fair cheek more fair; And for each briar-berry he might eat, A kiss should bud upon the tree of love, And pulp and ripen richer every hour, To melt away upon the traveller's lips. DAISY'S SONG I The sun, with his great eye, Sees not so much as I; And the moon, all silver-proud, Might as well be in a cloud. II And O the springâthe spring! I lead the life of a king! Couch'd in the teeming grass, I spy each pretty lass. III I look where no one dares, And I stare where no one stares, And when the night is nigh, Lambs bleat my lullaby. FOLLY'S SONG When wedding fiddles are a-playing, Huzza for folly O! And when maidens go a-maying, Huzza, &amp;c. When a milk-pail is upset, Huzza, &amp;c. And the clothes left in the wet, Huzza, &amp;c. When the barrel's set abroach, Huzza, &amp;c. When Kate Eyebrow keeps a coach, Huzza, &amp;c. When the pig is over-roasted, Huzza, &amp;c. And the cheese is over-toasted, Huzza, &amp;c. When Sir Snap is with his lawyer, Huzza, &amp;c. And Miss Chip has kiss'd the sawyer, Huzza, &amp;c. [Oh, I am frighten'd with most hateful thoughts!] Oh, I am frighten'd with most hateful thoughts! Perhaps her voice is not a nightingale's, Perhaps her teeth are not the fairest pearl; Her eye-lashes may be, for aught I know, Not longer than the May-fly's small fan-horns; There may not be one dimple on her hand; And freckles many; ah! a careless nurse, In haste to teach the little thing to walk, May have crumpt up a pair of Dian's legs, And warpt the ivory of a Juno's neck. SONG [The stranger lighted from his steed] I The stranger lighted from his steed, And ere he spake a word, He seiz'd my lady's lilly hand, And kiss'd it all unheard. II The stranger walk'd into the hall, And ere he spake a word, He kiss'd my lady's cherry lips, And kiss'd 'em all unheard. III The stranger walk'd into the bower,â But my lady first did go,â Aye hand in hand into the bower, Where my lord's roses blow. IV My lady's maid had a silken scarf, And a golden ring had she, And a kiss from the stranger, as off he went Again on his fair palfrey. [Asleep! O sleep a little while, white pearl!] Asleep! O sleep a little while, white pearl! And let me kneel, and let me pray to thee, And let me call Heaven's blessing on thine eyes, And let me breathe into the happy air, That doth enfold and touch thee all about, Vows of my slavery, my giving up, My sudden adoration, my great love! FAERY SONGS I. [Shed no tearâO shed no tear!] Shed no tearâO shed no tear! The flower will bloom another year. Weep no moreâO weep no more! Young buds sleep in the root's white core. Dry your eyesâO dry your eyes, For I was taught in Paradise To ease my breast of melodiesâ Shed no tear. Overheadâlook overhead 'Mong the blossoms white and redâ Look up, look upâI flutter now On this flush pomegranate boughâ See meâ'tis this silvery bill Ever cures the good man's illâ Shed no tearâO shed no tear! The flower will bloom another year. AdieuâAdieuâI fly, adieu, I vanish in the heaven's blueâ Adieu, Adieu! II. [Ah! woe is me! poor silver-wing!] Ah! woe is me! poor silver-wing! That I must chant thy lady's dirge, And death to this fair haunt of spring, Of melody, and streams of flowery verge,â Poor silver-wing! ah! woe is me! That I must see These blossoms snow upon thy lady's pall! Go, pretty page! and in her ear Whisper that the hour is near! Softly tell her not to fear Such calm favonian burial! Go, pretty page! and soothly tell,â The blossoms hang by a melting spell, And fall they must, ere a star wink thrice Upon her closed eyes, That now in vain are weeping their last tears, At sweet life leaving, and these arbours green,â Rich dowry from the Spirit of the Spheres,â Alas! poor Queen! SONNET TO HOMER Standing aloof in giant ignorance, Of thee I hear and of the Cyclades, As one who sits ashore and longs perchance To visit dolphin-coral in deep seas. So thou wast blind;âbut then the veil was rent, For Jove uncurtain'd Heaven to let thee live, And Neptune made for thee a spumy tent, And Pan made sing for thee his forest-hive; Aye on the shores of darkness there is light, And precipices show untrodden green, There is a budding morrow in midnight, There is a triple sight in blindness keen; Such seeing hadst thou, as it once befel To Dian, Queen of Earth, and Heaven, and Hell. SONG [Spirit here that reignest!] [Written on a blank page in Beaumont and Fletcher's Works, between âCupid's Revengeâ and âThe Two Noble Kinsmen.â] I Spirit here that reignest! Spirit here that painest! Spirit here that burnest! Spirit here that mournest! Spirit, I bow My forehead low, Enshaded with thy pinions. Spirit, I look All passion-struck Into thy pale dominions. II Spirit here that laughest! Spirit here that quaffest! Spirit here that dancest! Noble soul that prancest! Spirit, with thee I join in the glee A-nudging the elbow of Momus. Spirit, I flush With a Bacchanal blush Just fresh from the Banquet of Comus. TEIGNMOUTH âSOME DOGGERELâ SENT IN A LETTER TO B. R. HAYDON I Here all the summer could I stay, For there's Bishop's teign And King's teign And Coomb at the clear teign headâ Where close by the stream You may have your cream All spread upon barley bread. II There's arch Brook And there's larch Brook Both turning many a mill; And cooling the drouth Of the salmon's mouth, And fattening his silver gill. III There is Wild wood, A Mild hood To the sheep on the lea o' the down, Where the golden furze, With its green, thin spurs, Doth catch at the maiden's gown. IV There is Newton marsh With its spear grass harshâ A pleasant summer level Where the maidens sweet Of the Market Street, Do meet in the dusk to revel. V There's the Barton rich With dyke and ditch And hedge for the thrush to live in And the hollow tree For the buzzing bee And a bank for the wasp to hive in. VI And O, and O The daisies blow And the primroses are waken'd, And violets white Sit in silver plight, And the green bud's as long as the spike end. VII Then who would go Into dark Soho, And chatter with dack'd hair'd critics, When he can stay For the new-mown hay, And startle the dappled Prickets? THE DEVON MAID STANZAS SENT IN A LETTER TO B. R. HAYDON I Where be ye going, you Devon Maid? And what have ye there in the Basket? Ye tight little fairy just fresh from the dairy, Will ye give me some cream if I ask it? II I love your Meads, and I love your flowers, And I love your junkets mainly, But 'hind the door I love kissing more, O look not so disdainly. III I love your hills, and I love your dales, And I love your flocks a-bleatingâ But O, on the heather to lie together, With both our hearts a-beating! IV I'll put your Basket all safe in a nook, Your shawl I hang up on the willow, And we will sigh in the daisy's eye And kiss on a grass green pillow. EPISTLE TO JOHN HAMILTON REYNOLDS Dear Reynolds! as last night I lay in bed, There came before my eyes that wonted thread Of shapes, and shadows, and remembrances, That every other minute vex and please: Things all disjointed come from north and south,â Two Witch's eyes above a Cherub's mouth, Voltaire with casque and shield and habergeon, And Alexander with his nightcap on; Old Socrates a-tying his cravat, And Hazlitt playing with Miss Edgeworth's cat; And Junius Brutus, pretty well so so, Making the best of's way towards Soho. Few are there who escape these visitings,â Perhaps one or two whose lives have patent wings, And thro' whose curtains peeps no hellish nose, No wild-boar tushes, and no Mermaid's toes; But flowers bursting out with lusty pride, And young Ãolian harps personified; Some Titian colours touch'd into real life,â The sacrifice goes on; the pontiff knife Gleams in the Sun, the milk-white heifer lows, The pipes go shrilly, the libation flows: A white sail shows above the green-head cliff, Moves round the point, and throws her anchor stiff; The mariners join hymn with those on land. You know the Enchanted Castle,âit doth stand Upon a rock, on the border of a Lake, Nested in trees, which all do seem to shake From some old magic-like Urganda's Sword. O PhÅbus! that I had thy sacred word To show this Castle, in fair dreaming wise, Unto my friend, while sick and ill he lies! You know it well enough, where it doth seem A mossy place, a Merlin's Hall, a dream; You know the clear Lake, and the little Isles, The mountains blue, and cold near neighbour rills, All which elsewhere are but half animate; There do they look alive to love and hate, To smiles and frowns; they seem a lifted mound Above some giant, pulsing underground. Part of the Building was a chosen See, Built by a banish'd Santon of Chaldee; The other part, two thousand years from him, Was built by Cuthbert de Saint Aldebrim; Then there's a little wing, far from the Sun, Built by a Lapland Witch turn'd maudlin Nun; And many other juts of aged stone Founded with many a mason-devil's groan. The doors all look as if they op'd themselves, The windows as if latch'd by Fays and Elves, And from them comes a silver flash of light, As from the westward of a Summer's night; Or like a beauteous woman's large blue eyes Gone mad thro' olden songs and poesies. See! what is coming from the distance dim! A golden Galley all in silken trim! Three rows of oars are lightening, moment whiles, Into the verd'rous bosoms of those isles; Towards the shade, under the Castle wall, It comes in silence,ânow 'tis hidden all. The Clarion sounds, and from a Postern-gate An echo of sweet music doth create A fear in the poor Herdsman, who doth bring His beasts to trouble the enchanted spring,â He tells of the sweet music, and the spot, To all his friends, and they believe him not. O that our dreamings all, of sleep or wake, Would all their colours from the sunset take: From something of material sublime, Rather than shadow our own soul's day-time In the dark void of night. For in the world We jostle,âbut my flag is not unfurl'd On the Admiral-staff,âand so philosophize I dare not yet! Oh, never will the prize, High reason, and the love of good and ill, Be my award! Things cannot to the will Be settled, but they tease us out of thought; Or is it that imagination brought Beyond its proper bound, yet still confin'd, Lost in a sort of Purgatory blind, Cannot refer to any standard law Of either earth or heaven? It is a flaw In happiness, to see beyond our bourn,â It forces us in summer skies to mourn, It spoils the singing of the Nightingale. Dear Reynolds! I have a mysterious tale, And cannot speak it: the first page I read Upon a Lampit rock of green sea-weed Among the breakers; 'twas a quiet eve, The rocks were silent, the wide sea did weave An untumultuous fringe of silver foam Along the flat brown sand; I was at home And should have been most happy,âbut I saw Too far into the sea, where every maw The greater on the less feeds evermore.â But I saw too distinct into the core Of an eternal fierce destruction, And so from happiness I far was gone. Still am I sick of it, and tho', to-day, I've gather'd young spring-leaves, and flowers gay Of periwinkle and wild strawberry, Still do I that most fierce destruction see,â The Shark at savage prey,âthe Hawk at pounce,â The gentle Robin, like a Pard or Ounce, Ravening a worm,âAway, ye horrid moods! Moods of one's mind! You know I hate them well. You know I'd sooner be a clapping Bell To some Kamtschatcan Missionary Church, Than with these horrid moods be left i' the lurch. DAWLISH FAIR Over the Hill and over the Dale, And over the Bourne to Dawlish, Where ginger-bread wives have a scanty sale, And ginger-bread nuts are smallish. FRAGMENT OF AN ODE TO MAIA, WRITTEN ON MAY DAY, 1818 Mother of Hermes! and still youthful Maia! May I sing to thee As thou wast hymned on the shores of BaiÃ¦? Or may I woo thee In earlier Sicilian? or thy smiles Seek as they once were sought, in Grecian isles, By bards who died content on pleasant sward, Leaving great verse unto a little clan? O, give me their old vigour, and unheard Save of the quiet Primrose, and the span Of heaven and few ears, Rounded by thee, my song should die away Content as theirs, Rich in the simple worship of a day. ACROSTIC GEORGIANA AUGUSTA KEATS Give me your patience Sister while I frame Exact in Capitals your golden name Or sue the fair Apollo and he will Rouse from his heavy slumber and instil Great love in me for thee and Poesy. Imagine not that greatest mastery And kingdom over all the Realms of verse Nears more to Heaven in aught than when we nurse And surety give to love and Brotherhood. Anthropophagi in Othello's mood; Ulysses stormed, and his enchanted belt Glow with the Muse, but they are never felt Unbosom'd so and so eternal made, Such tender incense in their Laurel shade, To all the regent sisters of the Nine As this poor offering to you, sister mine. Kind sister! aye, this third name says you are; Enchanted has it been the Lord knows where. And may it taste to you like good old wine, Take you to real happiness and give Sons, daughters and a home like honied hive. SONNET ON VISITING THE TOMB OF BURNS The town, the churchyard, and the setting sun, The clouds, the trees, the rounded hills all seem, Though beautiful, coldâstrangeâas in a dream, I dreamed long ago, now new begun. The short-liv'd, paly Summer is but won From Winter's ague, for one hour's gleam; Though sapphire-warm, their stars do never beam: All is cold Beauty; pain is never done: For who has mind to relish, Minos-wise, The Real of Beauty, free from that dead hue Sickly imagination and sick pride Cast wan upon it! Burns! with honour due I oft have honour'd thee. Great shadow, hide Thy face; I sin against thy native skies. MEG MERRILIES I Old Meg she was a Gipsy, And liv'd upon the Moors: Her bed it was the brown heath turf, And her house was out of doors. II Her apples were swart blackberries, Her currants pods o' broom; Her wine was dew of the wild white rose, Her book a churchyard tomb. III Her Brothers were the craggy hills, Her Sisters larchen treesâ Alone with her great family She liv'd as she did please. IV No breakfast had she many a morn, No dinner many a noon, And 'stead of supper she would stare Full hard against the Moon. V But every morn of woodbine fresh She made her garlanding, And every night the dark glen Yew She wove, and she would sing. VI And with her fingers old and brown She plaited Mats o' Rushes, And gave them to the Cottagers She met among the Bushes. VII Old Meg was brave as Margaret Queen And tall as Amazon: An old red blanket cloak she wore; A chip hat had she on. God rest her aged bones somewhereâ She died full long agone! A SONG ABOUT MYSELF FROM A LETTER TO FANNY KEATS I. There was a naughty Boy, A naughty boy was he, He would not stop at home, He could not quiet beâ He took In his Knapsack A Book Full of vowels And a shirt With some towelsâ A slight cap For night capâ A hair brush, Comb ditto, New Stockings For old ones Would split O! This Knapsack Tight at's back He rivetted close And followÃ©d his Nose To the North, To the North, And follow'd his nose To the North. II. There was a naughty boy And a naughty boy was he, For nothing would he do But scribble poetryâ He took An ink stand In his hand And a pen Big as ten In the other, And away In a Pother He ran To the mountains And fountains And ghostes And Postes And witches And ditches And wrote In his coat When the weather Was cool, Fear of gout, And without When the weather Was warmâ Och the charm When we choose To follow one's nose To the north, To the north, To follow one's nose To the north! III. There was a naughty boy And a naughty boy was he, He kept little fishes In washing tubs three In spite Of the might Of the Maid Nor afraid Of his Granny-goodâ He often would Hurly burly Get up early And go By hook or crook To the brook And bring home Miller's thumb, Tittlebat Not over fat, Minnows small As the stall Of a glove, Not above The size Of a nice Little Baby's Little fingersâ O he made 'Twas his trade Of Fish a pretty Kettle A Kettleâ A Kettle Of Fish a pretty Kettle A Kettle! IV. There was a naughty Boy, And a naughty Boy was he He ran away to Scotland The people for to seeâ Then he found That the ground Was as hard, That a yard Was as long, That a song Was as merry, That a cherry Was as redâ That lead Was as weighty, That fourscore Was as eighty, That a door Was as wooden As in Englandâ So he stood in his shoes And he wonder'd, He wonder'd, He stood in his shoes And he wonder'd. A GALLOWAY SONG FROM A LETTER TO TOM KEATS Ah! ken ye what I met the day Out oure the Mountains A coming down by craggi[e]s grey An mossie fountainsâ A[h] goud hair'd Marie yeve I pray Ane minute's guessingâ For that I met upon the way Is past expressing. As I stood where a rocky brig A torrent crosses I spied upon a misty rig A troup o' Horsesâ And as they trotted down the glen I sped to meet them To see if I might know the Men To stop and greet them. First Willie on his sleek mare came At canting gallop His long hair rustled like a flame On board a shallop. Then came his brother Rab and then Young Peggy's Mither And Peggy tooâadown the glen They went togitherâ I saw her wrappit in her hood Fra wind and rainingâ Her cheek was flush wi' timid blood Twixt growth and waningâ She turn'd her dazed head full oft For there her Brithers Came riding with her Bridegroom soft And mony ithers. Young Tam came up an' eyed me quick With reddened cheekâ Braw Tam was daffed like a chickâ He coud na speakâ Ah Marie they are all gane hame Through blustering weather An' every heart is full on flame An' light as feather. Ah! Marie they are all gone hame Fra happy wedding, Whilst IâAh is it not a shame? Sad tears am shedding. SONNET TO AILSA ROCK Hearken, thou craggy ocean pyramid! Give answer from thy voice, the sea-fowls' screams! When were thy shoulders mantled in huge streams? When, from the sun, was thy broad forehead hid? How long is't since the mighty power bid Thee heave to airy sleep from fathom dreams? Sleep in the lap of thunder or sunbeams, Or when grey clouds are thy cold coverlid. Thou answer'st not; for thou art dead asleep; Thy life is but two dead eternitiesâ The last in air, the former in the deep; First with the whales, last with the eagle-skiesâ Drown'd wast thou till an earthquake made thee steep, Another cannot wake thy giant size. SONNET WRITTEN IN THE COTTAGE WHERE BURNS WAS BORN This mortal body of a thousand days Now fills, O Burns, a space in thine own room, Where thou didst dream alone on budded bays, Happy and thoughtless of thy day of doom! My pulse is warm with thine own Barley-bree, My head is light with pledging a great soul, My eyes are wandering, and I cannot see, Fancy is dead and drunken at its goal; Yet can I stamp my foot upon thy floor, Yet can I ope thy window-sash to find The meadow thou hast tramped o'er and o'er,â Yet can I think of thee till thought is blind,â Yet can I gulp a bumper to thy name,â O smile among the shades, for this is fame! LINES WRITTEN IN THE HIGHLANDS AFTER A VISIT TO BURNS'S COUNTRY There is a charm in footing slow across a silent plain, Where patriot battle has been fought, where glory had the gain; There is a pleasure on the heath where Druids old have been, Where mantles grey have rustled by and swept the nettles green; There is a joy in every spot made known by times of old, New to the feet, although each tale a hundred times be told; There is a deeper joy than all, more solemn in the heart, More parching to the tongue than all, of more divine a smart, When weary steps forget themselves upon a pleasant turf, Upon hot sand, or flinty road, or sea-shore iron scurf, Toward the castle or the cot, where long ago was born One who was great through mortal days, and died of fame unshorn, Light heather-bells may tremble then, but they are far away; Wood-lark may sing from sandy fern,âthe Sun may hear his lay; Runnels may kiss the grass on shelves and shallows clear, But their low voices are not heard, though come on travels drear; Blood-red the Sun may set behind black mountain peaks; Blue tides may sluice and drench their time in caves and weedy creeks; Eagles may seem to sleep wing-wide upon the air; Ring-doves may fly convuls'd across to some high-cedar'd lair; But the forgotten eye is still fast lidded to the ground, As Palmer's, that with weariness, mid-desert shrine hath found. At such a time the soul's a child, in childhood is the brain; Forgotten is the worldly heartâalone, it beats in vain.â Aye, if a madman could have leave to pass a healthful day To tell his forehead's swoon and faint when first began decay, He might make tremble many a one whose spirit had gone forth To find a Bard's low cradle-place about the silent North! Scanty the hour and few the steps beyond the bourn of care, Beyond the sweet and bitter world,âbeyond it unaware! Scanty the hour and few the steps, because a longer stay Would bar return, and make a man forget his mortal way: O horrible! to lose the sight of well remember'd face, Of Brother's eyes, of Sister's browâconstant to every place; Filling the air, as on we move, with portraiture intense; More warm than those heroic tints that pain a painter's sense, When shapes of old come striding by, and visages of old, Locks shining black, hair scanty grey, and passions manifold. No, no, that horror cannot be, for at the cable's length Man feels the gentle anchor pull and gladdens in its strength:â One hour, half-idiot, he stands by mossy waterfall, But in the very next he reads his soul's memorial:â He reads it on the mountain's height, where chance he may sit down Upon rough marble diademâthat hill's eternal crown. Yet be his anchor e'er so fast, room is there for a prayer That man may never lose his mind on mountains black and bare; That he may stray league after league some great birthplace to find And keep his vision clear from speck, his inward sight unblind. THE GADFLY FROM A LETTER TO TOM KEATS I All gentle folks who owe a grudge To any living thing Open your ears and stay your t[r]udge Whilst I in dudgeon sing. II The Gadfly he hath stung me soreâ O may he ne'er sting you! But we have many a horrid bore He may sting black and blue. III Has any here an old grey Mare With three legs all her store, O put it to her Buttocks bare And straight she'll run on four. IV Has any here a Lawyer suit Of Seventeen-Forty-Three, Take Lawyer's nose and put it to 't And you the end will see. V Is there a Man in Parliament Dum[b-]founder'd in his speech, O let his neighbour make a rent And put one in his breech. VI O Lowther how much better thou Hadst figur'd t'other day When to the folks thou mad'st a bow And hadst no more to say VII If lucky Gadfly had but ta'en His seat And put thee to a little pain To save thee from a worse. VIII Better than Southey it had been, Better than Mr. D?, Better than Wordsworth too, I ween, Better than Mr. V?. IX Forgive me pray good people all For deviating soâ In spirit sure I had a callâ And now I on will go. X Has any here a daughter fair Too fond of reading novels, Too apt to fall in love with care And charming Mister Lovels, XI O put a Gadfly to that thing She keeps so white and pertâ I mean the finger for the ring, And it will breed a wort. XII Has any here a pious spouse Who seven times a day Scolds as King David pray'd, to chouse And have her holy wayâ XIII O let a Gadfly's little sting Persuade her sacred tongue That noises are a common thing, But that her bell has rung. XIV And as this is the summum bo- num of all conquering, I leave âwithouten wordes moâ The Gadfly's little sting. SONNET ON HEARING THE BAG-PIPE AND SEEING âTHE STRANGERâ PLAYED AT INVERARY Of late two dainties were before me plac'd Sweet, holy, pure, sacred and innocent, From the ninth sphere to me benignly sent That Gods might know my own particular taste: First the soft Bag-pipe mourn'd with zealous haste, The Stranger next with head on bosom bent Sigh'd; rueful again the piteous Bag-pipe went, Again the Stranger sighings fresh did waste. O Bag-pipe thou didst steal my heart awayâ O Stranger thou my nerves from Pipe didst charmâ O Bag-pipe thou didst re-assert thy swayâ Again thou Stranger gav'st me fresh alarmâ Alas! I could not choose. Ah! my poor heart, Mum chance art thou with both oblig'd to part. STAFFA Not Aladdin magian Ever such a work began; Not the wizard of the Dee Ever such a dream could see; Not St. John, in Patmos' Isle, In the passion of his toil, When he saw the churches seven, Golden aisl'd, built up in heaven, Gaz'd at such a rugged wonder. As I stood its roofing under, Lo! I saw one sleeping there, On the marble cold and bare. While the surges wash'd his feet, And his garments white did beat Drench'd about the sombre rocks, On his neck his well-grown locks, Lifted dry above the main, Were upon the curl again. âWhat is this? and what art thou?â Whisper'd I, and touch'd his brow; âWhat art thou? and what is this?â Whisper'd I, and strove to kiss The spirit's hand, to wake his eyes; Up he started in a trice: âI am Lycidas,â said he, âFam'd in funeral minstrelsy! This was architectur'd thus By the great Oceanus!â Here his mighty waters play Hollow organs all the day; Here by turns his dolphins all, Finny palmers great and small, Come to pay devotion dueâ Each a mouth of pearls must strew. Many a mortal of these days, Dares to pass our sacred ways, Dares to touch audaciously This Cathedral of the Sea! I have been the pontiff-priest Where the waters never rest, Where a fledgy sea-bird choir Soars for ever; holy fire I have hid from mortal man; Proteus is my Sacristan. But the dulled eye of mortal Hath pass'd beyond the rocky portal; So for ever will I leave Such a taint, and soon unweave All the magic of the place.â So saying, with a Spirit's glance He dived! SONNET WRITTEN UPON THE TOP OF BEN NEVIS Read me a lesson, Muse, and speak it loud Upon the top of Nevis, blind in mist! I look into the chasms, and a shroud Vapourous doth hide them,âjust so much I wist Mankind do know of hell; I look o'erhead, And there is sullen mist,âeven so much Mankind can tell of heaven; mist is spread Before the earth, beneath me,âeven such, Even so vague is man's sight of himself! Here are the craggy stones beneath my feet,â Thus much I know that, a poor witless elf, I tread on them,âthat all my eye doth meet Is mist and crag, not only on this height, But in the world of thought and mental might! BEN NEVIS A DIALOGUE [Persons: Mrs. Cameron and Ben Nevis] MRS. C. Upon my life Sir Nevis I am pique'd That I have so far panted tugg'd and reek'd To do an hono[u]r to your old bald pate And now am sitting on you just to bate, Without your paying me one compliment. Alas 'tis so with all, when our intent Is plain, and in the eye of all Mankind We fair ones show a preference, too blind! You Gentle man immediately turn tailâ O let me then my hapless fate bewail! Ungrateful Baldpate, have I not disdain'd The pleasant Valleysâhave I not, madbrain'd, Deserted all my Pickles and preserves, My China closet tooâwith wretched Nerves To bootâsay, wretched ingrate, have I not Le[f]t my soft cushion chair and caudle pot? 'Tis true I had no cornsâno! thank the fates, My Shoemaker was always Mr. Bates. And if not Mr. Bates why I'm not old! Still dumb, ungrateful Nevisâstill so cold! Here the Lady took some more w[h]iskey and was putting even more to her lips when she dashed [it] to the Ground for the Mountain began to grumbleâ which continued for a few minutes before he thus began, BEN NEVIS. What whining bit of tongue and Mouth thus dares Disturb my slumber of a thousand years? Even so long my sleep has been secureâ And to be so awaked I'll not endure. Oh painâfor since the Eagle's earliest scream I've had a dam[n]'d confounded ugly dream, A Nightmare sure. What, Madam, was it you? It cannot be! My old eyes are not true! Red-Crag, my Spectacles! Now let me see! Good Heavens, Lady, how the gemini Did you get here? O I shall split my sides! I shall earthquakeâ MRS. C. Sweet Nevis, do not quake, for though I love You[r] honest Countenance all things above, Truly I should not like to be convey'd So far into your Bosomâgentle Maid Loves not too rough a treatment, gentle Sirâ Pray thee be calm and do not quake nor stir, No not a Stone, or I shall go in fitsâ BEN NEVIS. I mustâI shallâI meet not such tit bitsâ I meet not such sweet creatures every dayâ By my old night-cap, night-cap night and day, I must have one sweet BussâI must and shall! Red-Crag!âWhat, Madam, can you then repent Of all the toil and vigour you have spent To see Ben Nevis and to touch his nose? Red-Crag, I say! O I must have them close! Red-Crag, there lies beneath my farthest toe A vein of Sulphurâgo dear Red-Crag, goâ And rub your flinty back against itâbudge! Dear Madam, I must kiss you, faith I must! I must Embrace you with my dearest gust! Block-head, dy'e hearâBlock-head, I'll make her feelâ There lies beneath my east leg's northern heel A cave of young earth dragonsâwell, my boy, Go thither quick and so complete my joy; Take you a bundle of the largest pines And when the sun on fiercest Phosphor shines Fire them and ram them in the Dragon's nest, Then will the dragons fry and fizz their best Until ten thousand now no bigger than Poor Al[l]igatorsâpoor things of one spanâ Will each one swell to twice ten times the size Of northern whaleâthen for the tender prizeâ The moment thenâfor then will Red-Crag rub His flinty backâand I shall kiss and snub And press my dainty morsel to my breast. Block-head, make haste! O Muses weep the restâ The lady fainted and he thought her dead So pulled the clouds again about his head And went to sleep againâsoon she was rous'd By her affrighted servantsânext day hous'd Safe on the lowly ground she bless'd her fate That fainting fit was not delayed too late. TRANSLATION FROM A SONNET OF RONSARD Nature withheld Cassandra in the skies, For more adornment, a full thousand years; She took their cream of Beauty's fairest dyes, And shap'd and tinted her above all Peers: Meanwhile Love kept her dearly with his wings, And underneath their shadow fill'd her eyes With such a richness that the cloudy Kings Of high Olympus utter'd slavish sighs. When from the Heavens I saw her first descend, My heart took fire, and only burning pains, They were my pleasuresâthey my Life's sad end; Love pour'd her beauty into my warm veins... A PROPHECY: TO GEORGE KEATS IN AMERICA 'Tis the witching hour of night, Orbed is the moon and bright, And the stars they glisten, glisten, Seeming with bright eyes to listenâ For what listen they? For a song and for a charm, See they glisten in alarm, And the moon is waxing warm To hear what I shall say. Moon! keep wide thy golden earsâ Hearken, stars! and hearken, spheres!â Hearken, thou eternal sky! I sing an infant's lullaby, A pretty lullaby. Listen, listen, listen, listen, Glisten, glisten, glisten, glisten, And hear my lullaby! Though the rushes that will make Its cradle still are in the lakeâ Though the linen that will be Its swathe, is on the cotton treeâ Though the woollen that will keep It warm, is on the silly sheepâ Listen, starlight, listen, listen, Glisten, glisten, glisten, glisten, And hear my lullaby! Child, I see thee! Child, I've found thee Midst of the quiet all around thee! Child, I see thee! Child, I spy thee! And thy mother sweet is nigh thee! Child, I know thee! Child no more, But a Poet evermore! See, see, the lyre, the lyre, In a flame of fire, Upon the little cradle's top Flaring, flaring, flaring, Past the eyesight's bearing. Awake it from its sleep, And see if it can keep Its eyes upon the blazeâ Amaze, amaze! It stares, it stares, it stares, It dares what no one dares! It lifts its little hand into the flame Unharm'd, and on the strings Paddles a little tune, and sings, With dumb endeavour sweetlyâ Bard art thou completely! Little child O'th' western wild, Bard art thou completely! Sweetly with dumb endeavour, A Poet now or never, Little child O'th' western wild, A Poet now or never! STANZAS [In a drear-nighted December] I In a drear-nighted December, Too happy, happy tree, Thy branches ne'er remember Their green felicity: The north cannot undo them, With a sleety whistle through them; Nor frozen thawings glue them From budding at the prime. II In a drear-nighted December, Too happy, happy brook, Thy bubblings ne'er remember Apollo's summer look; But with a sweet forgetting, They stay their crystal fretting, Never, never petting About the frozen time. III Ah would 'twere so with many A gentle girl and boy! But were there ever any Writh'd not at passed joy? To know the change and feel it, When there is none to heal it, Nor numbed sense to steel it, Was never said in rhyme. SPENSERIAN STANZA [Written at the close of Canto II, Book V, of âThe Faerie Queene.â] In after-time, a sage of mickle lore Yclep'd Typographus, the Giant took, And did refit his limbs as heretofore, And made him read in many a learned book, And into many a lively legend look; Thereby in goodly themes so training him, That all his brutishness he quite forsook, When, meeting Artegall and Talus grim, The one he struck stone-blind, the other's eyes wox dim. THE EVE OF SAINT MARK Upon a Sabbath-day it fell; Twice holy was the Sabbath-bell, That call'd the folk to evening prayer; The city streets were clean and fair From wholesome drench of April rains; And, on the western window panes, The chilly sunset faintly told Of unmatur'd green vallies cold, Of the green thorny bloomless hedge, Of rivers new with spring-tide sedge, Of primroses by shelter'd rills, And daisies on the aguish hills. Twice holy was the Sabbath-bell: The silent streets were crowded well With staid and pious companies, Warm from their fire-side orat'ries; And moving, with demurest air, To even-song, and vesper prayer. Each arched porch, and entry low, Was fill'd with patient folk and slow, With whispers hush, and shuffling feet, While play'd the organ loud and sweet. The bells had ceas'd, the prayers begun, And Bertha had not yet half done A curious volume, patch'd and torn, That all day long, from earliest morn, Had taken captive her two eyes, Among its golden broideries; Perplex'd her with a thousand things,â The stars of Heaven, and angels' wings, Martyrs in a fiery blaze, Azure saints in silver rays, Moses' breastplate, and the seven Candlesticks John saw in Heaven, The winged Lion of Saint Mark, And the Covenantal Ark, With its many mysteries, Cherubim and golden mice. Bertha was a maiden fair, Dwelling in the old Minster-square; From her fire-side she could see, Sidelong, its rich antiquity, Far as the Bishop's garden-wall; Where sycamores and elm-trees tall, Full-leav'd, the forest had outstript, By no sharp north-wind ever nipt, So shelter'd by the mighty pile. Bertha arose, and read awhile, With forehead 'gainst the window-pane. Again she try'd, and then again, Until the dusk eve left her dark Upon the legend of St. Mark. From plaited lawn-frill, fine and thin, She lifted up her soft warm chin, With aching neck and swimming eyes, And daz'd with saintly imageries. All was gloom, and silent all, Save now and then the still foot-fall Of one returning homewards late, Past the echoing minster-gate. The clamorous daws, that all the day Above tree-tops and towers play, Pair by pair had gone to rest, Each in its ancient belfry-nest, Where asleep they fall betimes, To music of the drowsy chimes. All was silent, all was gloom, Abroad and in the homely room: Down she sat, poor cheated soul! And struck a lamp from the dismal coal; Lean'd forward, with bright drooping hair And slant book, full against the glare. Her shadow, in uneasy guise, Hover'd about, a giant size, On ceiling-beam and old oak chair, The parrot's cage, and panel square; And the warm angled winter screen, On which were many monsters seen, Call'd doves of Siam, Lima mice, And legless birds of Paradise, Macaw, and tender Avadavat, And silken-furr'd Angora cat. Untir'd she read, her shadow still Glower'd about, as it would fill The room with wildest forms and shades, As though some ghostly queen of spades Had come to mock behind her back, And dance, and ruffle her garments black. Untir'd she read the legend page, Of holy Mark, from youth to age, On land, on sea, in pagan chains, Rejoicing for his many pains. Sometimes the learned eremite, With golden star, or dagger bright, Referr'd to pious poesies Written in smallest crow-quill size Beneath the text; and thus the rhyme Was parcell'd out from time to time: ââAls writith he of swevenis, Men han beforne they wake in bliss, Whanne that hir friendes thinke hem bound In crimped shroude farre under grounde; And how a litling child mote be A saint er its nativitie, Gif that the modre (God her blesse!) Kepen in solitarinesse, And kissen devoute the holy croce. Of Goddes love, and Sathan's force,â He writith; and thinges many mo: Of swiche thinges I may not show. Bot I must tellen verilie Somdel of SaintÃ¨ Cicilie, And chieflie what he auctorethe Of SaintÃ¨ Markis life and dethe:â At length her constant eyelids come Upon the fervent martyrdom; Then lastly to his holy shrine, Exalt amid the tapers' shine At Venice,â ODE TO FANNY I Physician Nature! let my spirit blood! O ease my heart of verse and let me rest; Throw me upon thy Tripod, till the flood Of stifling numbers ebbs from my full breast. A theme! a theme! great nature! give a theme; Let me begin my dream. I comeâI see thee, as thou standest there, Beckon me not into the wintry air. II Ah! dearest love, sweet home of all my fears, And hopes, and joys, and panting miseries,â To-night, if I may guess, thy beauty wears A smile of such delight, As brilliant and as bright, As when with ravished, aching, vassal eyes, Lost in soft amaze, I gaze, I gaze! III Who now, with greedy looks, eats up my feast? What stare outfaces now my silver moon! Ah! keep that hand unravished at the least; Let, let, the amorous burnâ But, pr'ythee, do not turn The current of your heart from me so soon. O! save, in charity, The quickest pulse for me. IV Save it for me, sweet love! though music breathe Voluptuous visions into the warm air; Though swimming through the dance's dangerous wreath, Be like an April day, Smiling and cold and gay, A temperate lilly, temperate as fair; Then, Heaven! there will be A warmer June for me. V Why, thisâyou'll say, my Fanny! is not true: Put your soft hand upon your snowy side, Where the heart beats: confessâ'tis nothing newâ Must not a woman be A feather on the sea, Sway'd to and fro by every wind and tide? Of as uncertain speed As blow-ball from the mead? VI I know itâand to know it is despair To one who loves you as I love, sweet Fanny! Whose heart goes fluttering for you every where, Nor, when away you roam, Dare keep its wretched home, Love, love alone, his pains severe and many: Then, loveliest! keep me free, From torturing jealousy. VII Ah! if you prize my subdued soul above The poor, the fading, brief, pride of an hour; Let none profane my Holy See of love, Or with a rude hand break The sacramental cake: Let none else touch the just new-budded flower; If notâmay my eyes close, Love! on their lost repose. SONNET TO SLEEP O soft embalmer of the still midnight, Shutting, with careful fingers and benign, Our gloom-pleas'd eyes, embower'd from the light, Enshaded in forgetfulness divine: O soothest Sleep! if so it please thee, close In midst of this thine hymn my willing eyes, Or wait the âAmen,â ere thy poppy throws Around my bed its lulling charities. Then save me, or the passed day will shine Upon my pillow, breeding many woes,â Save me from curious Conscience, that still lords Its strength for darkness, burrowing like a mole; Turn the key deftly in the oiled wards, And seal the hushed Casket of my Soul. SONG [Hush, hush! tread softly! hush, hush my dear!] I Hush, hush! tread softly! hush, hush my dear! All the house is asleep, but we know very well That the jealous, the jealous old bald-pate may hear, Tho' you've padded his night-capâO sweet Isabel! Tho' your feet are more light than a Fairy's feet, Who dances on bubbles where brooklets meet,â Hush, hush! soft tiptoe! hush, hush my dear! For less than a nothing the jealous can hear. II No leaf doth tremble, no ripple is there On the river,âall's still, and the night's sleepy eye Closes up, and forgets all its Lethean care, Charm'd to death by the drone of the humming Mayfly; And the Moon, whether prudish or complaisant, Has fled to her bower, well knowing I want No light in the dusk, no torch in the gloom, But my Isabel's eyes, and her lips pulp'd with bloom. III Lift the latch! ah gently! ah tenderlyâsweet! We are dead if that latchet gives one little clink! Well doneânow those lips, and a flowery seatâ The old man may sleep, and the planets may wink; The shut rose shall dream of our loves, and awake Full blown, and such warmth for the morning's take, The stock-dove shall hatch her soft brace and shall coo, While I kiss to the melody, aching all through! SONG [I had a dove and the sweet dove died] I had a dove and the sweet dove died; And I have thought it died of grieving: O, what could it grieve for? Its feet were tied, With a silken thread of my own hand's weaving; Sweet little red feet! why should you dieâ Why should you leave me, sweet bird! why? You liv'd alone in the forest-tree, Why, pretty thing! would you not live with me? I kiss'd you oft and gave you white peas; Why not live sweetly, as in the green trees? ODE ON INDOLENCE âThey toil not, neither do they spin.â I One morn before me were three figures seen, With bowed necks, and joined hands, side-faced; And one behind the other stepp'd serene, In placid sandals, and in white robes graced; They pass'd, like figures on a marble urn, When shifted round to see the other side; They came again; as when the urn once more Is shifted round, the first seen shades return; And they were strange to me, as may betide With vases, to one deep in Phidian lore. II How is it, Shadows! that I knew ye not? How came ye muffled in so hush a mask? Was it a silent deep-disguised plot To steal away, and leave without a task My idle days? Ripe was the drowsy hour; The blissful cloud of summer-indolence Benumb'd my eyes; my pulse grew less and less; Pain had no sting, and pleasure's wreath no flower: O, why did ye not melt, and leave my sense Unhaunted quite of all butânothingness? III A third time pass'd they by, and, passing, turn'd Each one the face a moment whiles to me; Then faded, and to follow them I burn'd And ach'd for wings because I knew the three; The first was a fair Maid, and Love her name; The second was Ambition, pale of cheek, And ever watchful with fatigued eye; The last, whom I love more, the more of blame Is heap'd upon her, maiden most unmeek,â I knew to be my demon Poesy. IV They faded, and, forsooth! I wanted wings: O folly! What is love! and where is it? And for that poor Ambition! it springs From a man's little heart's short fever-fit; For Poesy!âno,âshe has not a joy,â At least for me,âso sweet as drowsy noons, And evenings steep'd in honied indolence; O, for an age so shelter'd from annoy, That I may never know how change the moons, Or hear the voice of busy common-sense! V And once more came they by;âalas! wherefore? My sleep had been embroider'd with dim dreams; My soul had been a lawn besprinkled o'er With flowers, and stirring shades, and baffled beams: The morn was clouded, but no shower fell, Tho' in her lids hung the sweet tears of May; The open casement press'd a new-leav'd vine, Let in the budding warmth and throstle's lay; O Shadows! 'twas a time to bid farewell! Upon your skirts had fallen no tears of mine. VI So, ye three Ghosts, adieu! Ye cannot raise My head cool-bedded in the flowery grass; For I would not be dieted with praise, A pet-lamb in a sentimental farce! Fade softly from my eyes, and be once more In masque-like figures on the dreamy urn; Farewell! I yet have visions for the night, And for the day faint visions there is store; Vanish, ye Phantoms! from my idle spright, Into the clouds, and never more return! SONNET [Why did I laugh to-night? No voice will tell] Why did I laugh to-night? No voice will tell: No God, no Demon of severe response, Deigns to reply from heaven or from Hell. Then to my human heart I turn at once. Heart! Thou and I are here sad and alone; I say, why did I laugh! O mortal pain! O Darkness! Darkness! ever must I moan, To question Heaven and Hell and Heart in vain. Why did I laugh? I know this Being's lease, My fancy to its utmost blisses spreads; Yet would I on this very midnight cease, And the world's gaudy ensigns see in shreds; Verse, Fame, and Beauty are intense indeed, But Death intenserâDeath is Life's high meed. SONNET A DREAM, AFTER READING DANTE'S EPISODE OF PAULO AND FRANCESCA As Hermes once took to his feathers light, When lulled Argus, baffled, swoon'd and slept, So on a Delphic reed, my idle spright So play'd, so charm'd, so conquer'd, so bereft The dragon-world of all its hundred eyes; And, seeing it asleep, so fled awayâ Not to pure Ida with its snow-cold skies, Nor unto Tempe where Jove griev'd a day; But to that second circle of sad hell, Where 'mid the gust, the whirlwind, and the flaw Of rain and hail-stones, lovers need not tell Their sorrows. Pale were the sweet lips I saw, Pale were the lips I kiss'd, and fair the form I floated with, about that melancholy storm. AN EXTEMPORE FROM A LETTER TO GEORGE KEATS AND HIS WIFE [[Canto the xii]] When they were come into the Faery's Court They rangâno one at homeâall gone to sport And dance and kiss and love as faeries do For Fa[e]ries be as humans, lovers trueâ Amid the woods they were, so lone and wild, Where even the Robin feels himself exil'd And where the very brooks as if afraid Hurry along to some less magic shade. âNo one at home!â the fretful princess cried âAnd all for nothing such a dre[a]ry ride, And all for nothing my new diamond cross, No one to see my Persian feathers toss, No one to see my Ape, my Dwarf, my Fool, Or how I pace my Otaheitan mule. Ape, Dwarf and Fool, why stand you gaping there? Burst the door open, quickâor I declare I'll switch you soundly and in pieces tear.â The Dwarf began to tremble and the Ape Star'd at the Fool, the Fool was all agape, The Princess grasp'd her switch, but just in time The dwarf with piteous face began to rhyme. âO mighty Princess did you ne'er hear tell What your poor servants know but too too well? Know you the three great crimes in faery land? The first, alas! poor Dwarf, I understandâ I made a whipstock of a faery's wandâ The next is snoring in their companyâ The next, the last, the direst of the three Is making free when they are not at home. I was a Princeâa baby princeâmy doom You see, I made a whipstock of a wandâ My top has henceforth slept in faery land. He was a Prince, the Fool, a grown up Prince, But he has never been a King's son since He fell a-snoring at a faery Ballâ Your poor Ape was a prince and he, poor thing, Picklock'd a faery's boudourânow no king, But apeâso pray your highness stay awhile; 'Tis sooth indeed, we know it to our sorrowâ Persist and you may be an ape tomorrowââ While the Dwarf spake the Princess all for spite Peal'd [sic] the brown hazel twig to lilly white, Clench'd her small teeth, and held her lips apart, Try'd to look unconcern'd with beating heart. They saw her highness had made up her mind And quaver'd like the reeds before the wind, And they had had it, but, O happy chance! The Ape for very fear began to dance And grin'd as all his ugliness did acheâ She staid her vixen fingers for his sake, He was so very ugly: then she took Her pocket glass mirror and began to look First at herself and [then] at him and then She smil'd at her own beauteous face again. Yet for all thisâfor all her pretty face She took it in her head to see the place. Women gain little from experience Either in Lovers, husbands or expense. The more the beauty, the more fortune too, Beauty before the wide world never knew. So each fair reasonsâtho' it oft miscarries. She thought her pretty face would please the fa[e]ries. âMy darling Ape I won't whip you todayâ Give me the Picklock, sirrah, and go play.â They all three weptâbut counsel was as vain As crying cup biddy to drops of rain. Yet lingeringly did the sad Ape forth draw The Picklock from the Pocket in his Jaw. The Princess took it and dismounting straight Trip'd in blue silver'd slippers to the gate And touch'd the wards, the Door opesfull cou[r]teou[s]ly Openedâshe enter'd with her servants three. Again it clos'd and there was nothing seen But the Mule grazing on the herbage green. End of Canto xii Canto the xiii The Mule no sooner saw himself alone Than he prick'd up his Earsâand said âwell done! At least, unhappy Prince, I may be freeâ No more a Princess shall side-saddle me. O King of OthaietÃ¨âtho' a Mule âAye every inch a Kingââtho' âFortune's foolââ Well doneâfor by what Mr. Dwarfy said I would not give a sixpence for her head.â Even as he spake he trotted in high glee To the knotty side of an old Pollard tree And rub['d] his sides against the mossed bark Till his Girths burst and left him naked stark Except his Bridleâhow get rid of that, Buckled and tied with many a twist and plait? At last it struck him to pretend to sleep And then the thievish Monkeys down would creep And filch the unpleasant trammels quite away. No sooner thought of than adown he lay, Sham'd a good snoreâthe Monkey-men descended And whom they thought to injure they befriended. They hung his Bridle on a topmost bough And of[f] he went, run, trot, or anyhowâ Brown is gone to bedâand I am tired of rhyming... SPENSERIAN STANZAS ON CHARLES ARMITAGE BROWN I He is to weet a melancholy carle: Thin in the waist, with bushy head of hair, As hath the seeded thistle when in parle It holds the Zephyr, ere it sendeth fair Its light balloons into the summer air; Therto his beard had not begun to bloom, No brush had touch'd his chin or razor sheer; No care had touch'd his cheek with mortal doom, But new he was and bright as scarf from Persian loom. II Ne cared he for wine, or half-and-half Ne cared he for fish or flesh or fowl, And sauces held he worthless as the chaff; He 'sdeigned the swine-head at the wassail-bowl; Ne with lewd ribbalds sat he cheek by jowl; Ne with sly Lemans in the scorner's chair; But after water-brooks this Pilgrim's soul Panted, and all his food was woodland air Though he would oft-times feast on gilliflowers rare. III The slang of cities in no wise he knew, Tipping the wink to him was heathen Greek; He sipp'd no olden Tom or ruin blue, Or nantz or cherry-brandy drank full meek By many a damsel hoarse and rouge of cheek; Nor did he know each aged watchman's beat, Nor in obscured purlieus would he seek For curled Jewesses, with ankles neat, Who as they walk abroad make tinkling with their feet. TWO OR THREE FROM A LETTER TO HIS SISTER Two or three Posies With two or three simplesâ Two or three Noses With two or three pimplesâ Two or three wise men And two or three ninny'sâ Two or three purses And two or three guineasâ Two or three raps At two or three doorsâ Two or three naps Of two or three hoursâ Two or three Cats And two or three miceâ Two or three sprats At a very great priceâ Two or three sandies And two or three tabbiesâ Two or three dandies And two Mrs ? mum!

LA BELLE DAME SANS MERCI I Ah, what can ail thee, wretched wight, Alone and palely loitering; The sedge is wither'd from the lake, And no birds sing. II Ah, what can ail thee, wretched wight, So haggard and so woe-begone? The squirrel's granary is full, And the harvest's done. III I see a lilly on thy brow, With anguish moist and fever dew; And on thy cheek a fading rose Fast withereth too. IV I met a lady in the meads Full beautiful, a faery's child; Her hair was long, her foot was light, And her eyes were wild. V I set her on my pacing steed, And nothing else saw all day long; For sideways would she lean, and sing A faery's song. VI I made a garland for her head, And bracelets too, and fragrant zone; She look'd at me as she did love, And made sweet moan. VII She found me roots of relish sweet, And honey wild, and manna dew; And sure in language strange she said, I love thee true. VIII She took me to her elfin grot, And there she gaz'd and sighed deep, And there I shut her wild sad eyesâ So kiss'd to sleep. IX And there we slumber'd on the moss, And there I dream'd, ah woe betide, The latest dream I ever dream'd On the cold hill side. X I saw pale kings, and princes too, Pale warriors, death-pale were they all; Who cry'dââLa belle Dame sans merci Hath thee in thrall!â XI I saw their starv'd lips in the gloam With horrid warning gaped wide, And I awoke, and found me here On the cold hill side. XII And this is why I sojourn here Alone and palely loitering, Though the sedge is wither'd from the lake, And no birds sing. SONG OF FOUR FAERIES, Fire, Air, Earth, and Water, Salamander, Zephyr, Dusketha, and Breama. SALAMANDER. Happy, happy glowing fire! ZEPHYR. Fragrant air! delicious light! DUSKETHA. Let me to my glooms retire! BREAMA. I to green-weed rivers bright! SALAMANDER. Happy, happy glowing fire! Dazzling bowers of soft retire, Ever let my nourish'd wing, Like a bat's, still wandering, Faintless fan your fiery spaces, Spirit sole in deadly places. In unhaunted roar and blaze, Open eyes that never daze, Let me see the myriad shapes Of men, and beasts, and fish, and apes, Portray'd in many a fiery den, And wrought by spumy bitumen. On the deep intenser roof, Arched every way aloof, Let me breathe upon their skies, And anger their live tapestries; Free from cold, and every care, Of chilly rain, and shivering air. ZEPHYR. Spirit of Fire! away! away! Or your very roundelay Will sear my plumage newly budded From its quilled sheath, all studded With the self-same dews that fell On the May-grown Asphodel. Spirit of Fireâaway! away! BREAMA. Spirit of Fireâaway! away! Zephyr, blue-eyed Faery, turn, And see my cool sedge-bury'd urn, Where it rests its mossy brim 'Mid water-mint and cresses dim; And the flowers, in sweet troubles, Lift their eyes above the bubbles, Like our Queen, when she would please To sleep, and Oberon will teaze. Love me, blue-eyed Faery, true! Soothly I am sick for you. ZEPHYR. Gentle Breama! by the first Violet young nature nurst, I will bathe myself with thee, So you sometimes follow me To my home, far, far, in west, Beyond the nimble-wheeled quest Of the golden-browed sun: Come with me, o'er tops of trees, To my fragrant palaces, Where they ever floating are Beneath the cherish of a star Call'd Vesper, who with silver veil Ever hides his brilliance pale, Ever gently-drows'd doth keep Twilight for the Fayes to sleep. Fear not that your watery hair Will thirst in drouthy ringlets there; Clouds of stored summer rains Thou shalt taste, before the stains Of the mountain soil they take, And too unlucent for thee make. I love thee, crystal Faery, true! Sooth I am as sick for you! SALAMANDER. Out, ye aguish Faeries, out! Chilly lovers, what a rout Keep ye with your frozen breath, Colder than the mortal death. Adder-eyed Dusketha, speak, Shall we leave these, and go seek In the earth's wide entrails old Couches warm as their's are cold? O for a fiery gloom and thee, Dusketha, so enchantingly Freckle-wing'd and lizard-sided! DUSKETHA. By thee, Sprite, will I be guided! I care not for cold or heat; Frost and flame, or sparks, or sleet, To my essence are the same;â But I honour more the flame. Sprite of Fire, I follow thee Wheresoever it may be, To the torrid spouts and fountains, Underneath earth-quaked mountains; Or, at thy supreme desire, Touch the very pulse of fire With my bare unlidded eyes. SALAMANDER. Sweet Dusketha! paradise! Off, ye icy Spirits, fly! Frosty creatures of the sky! DUSKETHA. Breathe upon them, fiery sprite! ZEPHYR AND BREAMA. Away! away to our delight! SALAMANDER. Go, feed on icicles, while we Bedded in tongue-flames will be. DUSKETHA. Lead me to those feverous glooms, Sprite of Fire! BREAMA. Me to the blooms, Blue-eyed Zephyr, of those flowers Far in the west where the May-cloud lowers; And the beams of still Vesper, when winds are all wist, Are shed thro' the rain and the milder mist, And twilight your floating bowers. TWO SONNETS ON FAME I [Fame, like a wayward Girl, will still be coy] Fame, like a wayward Girl, will still be coy To those who woo her with too slavish knees, But makes surrender to some thoughtless Boy, And dotes the more upon a heart at ease; She is a Gipsey, will not speak to those Who have not learnt to be content without her; A Jilt, whose ear was never whisper'd close, Who thinks they scandal her who talk about her; A very Gipsey is she, Nilus-born, Sister-in-law to jealous Potiphar; Ye love-sick Bards, repay her scorn for scorn, Ye Artists lovelorn, madmen that ye are! Make your best bow to her and bid adieu, Then, if she likes it, she will follow you. II [How fever'd is the man, who cannot look] âYou cannot eat your cake and have it too.â âProverb. How fever'd is the man, who cannot look Upon his mortal days with temperate blood, Who vexes all the leaves of his life's book, And robs his fair name of its maidenhood; It is as if the rose should pluck herself, Or the ripe plum finger its misty bloom, As if a Naiad, like a meddling elf, Should darken her pure grot with muddy gloom, But the rose leaves herself upon the briar, For winds to kiss and grateful bees to feed, And the ripe plum still wears its dim attire, The undisturbed lake has crystal space, Why then should man, teasing the world for grace, Spoil his salvation for a fierce miscreed? SONNET ON THE SONNET If by dull rhymes our English must be chain'd, And, like Andromeda, the Sonnet sweet Fetter'd, in spite of pained loveliness, Let us find out, if we must be constrain'd, Sandals more interwoven and complete To fit the naked foot of Poesy: Let us inspect the Lyre, and weigh the stress Of every chord, and see what may be gain'd By ear industrious, and attention meet; Misers of sound and syllable, no less Than Midas of his coinage, let us be Jealous of dead leaves in the bay wreath crown; So, if we may not let the Muse be free, She will be bound with garlands of her own.

One Day. ACT I. Scene I. âAn Apartment in the Castle. Enter Conrad. Conrad. So, I am safe emerged from these broils! Amid the wreck of thousands I am whole; For every crime I have a laurel-wreath, For every lie a lordship. Nor yet has My ship of fortune furl'd her silken sails,â Let her glide on! This danger'd neck is saved, By dexterous policy, from the rebel's axe; And of my ducal palace not one stone Is bruised by the Hungarian petards. Toil hard, ye slaves, and from the miser-earth Bring forth once more my bullion, treasured deep, With all my jewell'd salvers, silver and gold, And precious goblets that make rich the wine. But why do I stand babbling to myself? Where is Auranthe? I have news for her Shallâ Enter Auranthe. Auranthe. Conrad! what tidings? Good, if I may guess From your alert eyes and high-lifted brows. What tidings of the battle? Albert? Ludolph? Otho? Conrad. You guess aright. And, sister, slurring o'er Our by-gone quarrels, I confess my heart Is beating with a child's anxiety, To make our golden fortune known to you. Auranthe. So serious? Conrad. Yes, so serious, that before I utter even the shadow of a hint Concerning what will make that sin-worn cheek Blush joyous blood through every lineament, You must make here a solemn vow to me. Auranthe. I prythee, Conrad, do not overact The hypocriteâwhat vow would you impose? Conrad. Trust me for once,âthat you may be assur'd 'Tis not confiding to a broken reed, A poor Court-bankrupt, outwitted and lost, Revolve these facts in your acutest mood, In such a mood as now you listen to me:â A few days since, I was an open rebel Against the Emperor, had suborn'd his son, Drawn off his nobles to revolt, and shown Contented fools causes for discontent Fresh hatch'd in my ambition's eagle nestâ So thriv'd I as a rebel, and behold Now I am Otho's favourite, his dear friend, His right hand, his brave Conrad. Auranthe. I confess You have intrigued with these unsteady times To admiration; but to be a favouriteâ Conrad. I saw my moment. The Hungarians, Collected silently in holes and corners, Appear'd, a sudden host, in the open day. I should have perish'd in our empire's wreck, But, calling interest loyalty, swore faith To most believing Otho; and so help'd His blood-stain'd ensigns to the victory In yesterday's hard fight, that it has turn'd The edge of his sharp wrath to eager kindness. Auranthe. So far yourself. But what is this to me More than that I am glad? I gratulate you. Conrad. Yes, sister, but it does regard you greatly, Nearly, momentously,âaye, painfully! Make me this vowâ Auranthe. Concerning whom or what? Conrad. Albert! Auranthe. I would inquire somewhat of him: You had a letter from me touching him? No treason 'gainst his head in deed or word! Surely you spar'd him at my earnest prayer? Give me the letterâit should not exist! Conrad. At one pernicious charge of the enemy, I, for a moment-whiles, was prisoner ta'en And rifled,âstuff! the horses' hoofs have minc'd it! Auranthe. He is alive? Conrad. He is! but here make oath To alienate him from your scheming brain, Divorce him from your solitary thoughts, And cloud him in such utter banishment, That when his person meets again your eye, Your vision shall quite lose its memory, And wander past him as through vacancy. Auranthe. I'll not be perjured. Conrad. No, nor great, nor mighty; You would not wear a crown, or rule a kingdom. To you it is indifferent. Auranthe. What means this? Conrad. You'll not be perjured! Go to Albert then, That camp-mushroomâdishonour of our house. Go, page his dusty heels upon a march, Furbish his jingling baldric while he sleeps, And share his mouldy ration in a siege. Yet stay,âperhaps a charm may call you back, And make the widening circlets of your eyes Sparkle with healthy fevers.âThe Emperor Hath given consent that you should marry Ludolph! Auranthe. Can it be, brother? For a golden crown With a queen's awful lips I doubly thank you! This is to wake in Paradise! Farewell Thou clod of yesterdayâ'twas not myself! Not till this moment did I ever feel My spirit's faculties! I'll flatter you For this, and be you ever proud of it; Thou, Jove-like, struck'dst thy forehead, And from the teeming marrow of thy brain I spring complete Minerva! But the princeâ His highness Ludolphâwhere is he? Conrad. I know not: When, lackeying my counsel at a beck, The rebel lords, on bended knees, received The Emperor's pardon, Ludolph kept aloof, Sole, in a stiff, fool-hardy, sulky pride; Yet, for all this, I never saw a father In such a sickly longing for his son. We shall soon see him, for the Emperor He will be here this morning. Auranthe. That I heard Among the midnight rumours from the camp. Conrad. You give up Albert to me? Auranthe. Harm him not! E'en for his higness Ludolph's sceptry hand, I would not Albert suffer any wrong. Conrad. Have I not laboured, plottedâ? Auranthe. See you spare him: Nor be pathetic, my kind benefactor, On all the many bounties of your hand,â 'Twas for yourself you labouredânot for me! Do you not count, when I am queen, to take Advantage of your chance discoveries Of my poor secrets, and so hold a rod Over my life? Conrad. Let not this slaveâthis villainâ Be cause of feud between us. See! he comes! Look, woman, look, your Albert is quite safe! In haste it seems. Now shall I be in the way, And wish'd with silent curses in my grave, Or side by side with 'whelmed mariners. Enter Albert. Albert. Fair on your graces fall this early morrow! So it is like to do, without my prayers, For your right noble names, like favourite tunes, Have fall'n full frequent from our Emperor's lips, High commented with smiles. Auranthe. Noble Albert! Conrad (aside). Noble! Auranthe. Such salutation argues a glad heart In our prosperity. We thank you, sir. Albert. Lady! O, would to Heaven your poor servant Could do you better service than mere words! But I have other greeting than mine own, From no less man than Otho, who has sent This ring as pledge of dearest amity; 'Tis chosen I hear from Hymen's jewel'ry, And you will prize it, lady, I doubt not, Beyond all pleasures past, and all to come. To you great dukeâ Conrad. To me! What of me, ha Albert. What pleas'd your grace to say? Conrad. Your message, sir! Albert. You mean not this to me? Conrad. Sister, this way; For there shall be no âgentle Albertsâ now, [Aside. No âsweet Auranthes!â [Exeunt Conrad and Auranthe. Albert (solus). The duke is out of temper; if he knows More than a brother of a sister ought, I should not quarrel with his peevishness. AurantheâHeaven preserve her always fair!â Is in the heady, proud, ambitious vein; I bicker not with her,âbid her farewell! She has taken flight from me, thenlet her soar,â He is a fool who stands at pining gaze! But for poor Ludolph, he is food for sorrow: No levelling bluster of my licens'd thoughts, No military swagger of my mind, Can smother from myself the wrong I've done him,â Without design, indeed,âyet is so,â And opiate for the conscience have I none! [Exit. Scene II. âThe Court-yard of the Castle. Martial Music. Enter, from the outer gate, Otho, Nobles, Knights, and Attendants. The Soldiers halt at the gate, with Banners in sight. Otho. Where is my noble herald? Enter Conrad, from the Castle, attended by two Knights and Servants. Albert following. Well, hast told Auranthe our intent imperial? Lest our rent banners, too o' the sudden shown, Should fright her silken casements, and dismay Her household to our lack of entertainment. A victory? Conrad. God save illustrious Otho! Otho. Aye, Conrad, it will pluck out all grey hairs; It is the best physician for the spleen; The courtliest inviter to a feast; The subtlest excuser of small faults; And a nice judge in the age and smack of wine. Enter, from the Castle, Auranthe, followed by Pages holding up her robes, and a train of Women. She kneels. Hail my sweet hostess! I do thank the stars, Or my good soldiers, or their ladies' eyes, That, after such a merry battle fought, I can, all safe in body and in soul, Kiss your fair hand and lady fortune's too. My ring! now, on my life, it doth rejoice These lips to feel't on this soft ivory! Keep it, my brightest daughter; it may prove The little prologue to a line of kings. I strove against thee and my hot-blood son, Dull blockhead that I was to be so blind, But now my sight is clear; forgive me, lady. Auranthe. My lord, I was a vassal to your frown, And now your favour makes me but more humble; In wintry winds the simple snow is safe, But fadeth at the greeting of the sun: Unto thine anger I might well have spoken, Taking on me a woman's privilege, But this so sudden kindness makes me dumb. Otho. What need of this? Enough, if you will be A potent tutoress to my wayward boy, And teach him, what it seems his nurse could not, To say, for once, I thank you. Sigifred! Albert. He has not yet return'd, my gracious liege. Otho. What then! No tidings of my friendly Arab? Conrad. None, mighty Otho. [To one of his Knights, who goes out. Send forth instantly An hundred horsemen from my honoured gates, To scour the plains and search the cottages. Cry a reward, to him who shall first bring News of that vanished Arabian, A full-heap'd helmet of the purest gold. Otho. More thanks, good Conrad; for, except my son's, There is no face I rather would behold Than that same quick-eyed pagan's. By the saints, This coming night of banquets must not light Her dazzling torches; nor the music breathe Smooth, without clashing cymbal, tones of peace And in-door melodies; nor the ruddy wine Ebb spouting to the lees; if I pledge not, In my first cup, that Arab! Albert. Mighty Monarch, I wonder not this stranger's victor-deeds So hang upon your spirit. Twice in the fight It was my chance to meet his olive brow, Triumphant in the enemy's shatter'd rhomb; And, to say truth, in any Christian arm I never saw such prowess. Otho. Did you ever? O, 'tis a noble boy!âtut!âwhat do I say? I mean a triple Saladin, whose eyes, When in the glorious scuffle they met mine, Seem'd to sayââSleep, old man, in safety sleep; I am the victory!â Conrad. Pity he's not here. Otho. And my son too, pity he is not here. Lady Auranthe, I would not make you blush, But can you give a guess where Ludolph is? Know you not of him? Auranthe. Indeed, my liege, no secretâ Otho. Nay, nay, without more words, dost know of him? Auranthe. I would I were so over-fortunate, Both for his sake and mine, and to make glad A father's ears with tidings of his son. Otho. I see 'tis like to be a tedious day. Were Theodore and Gonfred and the rest Sent forth with my commands? Albert. Aye, my lord. Otho. And no news! No news! 'Faith! 'tis very strange He thus avoids us. Lady, is't not strange? Will he be truant to you too? It is a shame. Conrad. Will't please your highness enter, and accept The unworthy welcome of your servant's house? Leaving your cares to one whose diligence May in few hours make pleasures of them all. Otho. Not so tedious, Conrad. No, no, no,â I must see Ludolph or theâWhat's that shout! Voices without. Huzza! huzza! Long live the Emperor! Other Voices. Fall back! Away there! Otho. Say, what noise is that? [Albert advancing from the back of the Stage, whither he had hastened on hearing the cheers of the soldiery. Albert. It is young Gersa, the Hungarian prince, Pick'd like a red stag from the fallow herd Of prisoners. Poor prince, forlorn he steps, Slow, and demure, and proud in his despair. If I may judge by his so tragic bearing, His eye not downcast, and his folded arm, He doth this moment wish himself asleep Among his fallen captains on yon plains. Enter Gersa, in chains, and guarded. Otho. Well said, Sir Albert. Gersa. Not a word of greeting, No welcome to a princely visitor, Most mighty Otho? Will not my great host Vouchsafe a syllable, before he bids His gentlemen conduct me with all care To some securest lodging?âcold perhaps! Otho. What mood is this? Hath fortune touch'd thy brain? Gersa. O kings and princes of this fev'rous world, What abject things, what mockeries must ye be, What nerveless minions of safe palaces! When here, a monarch, whose proud foot is used To fallen princes' necks, as to his stirrup, Must needs exclaim that I am mad forsooth, Because I cannot flatter with bent knees My conqueror! Otho. Gersa, I think you wrong me: I think I have a better fame abroad. Gersa. I prythee mock me not with gentle speech, But, as a favour, bid me from thy presence; Let me no longer be the wondering food Of all these eyes; prythee command me hence! Otho. Do not mistake me, Gersa. That you may not, Come, fair Auranthe, try if your soft hands Can manage those hard rivets to set free So brave a prince and soldier. Auranthe (sets him free). Welcome task! Gersa. I am wound up in deep astonishment! Thank you, fair lady. Otho! emperor! You rob me of myself; my dignity Is now your infant; I am a weak child. Otho. Give me your hand, and let this kindly grasp Live in our memories. Gersa. In mine it will. I blush to think of my unchasten'd tongue; But I was haunted by the monstrous ghost Of all our slain battalions. Sire, reflect, And pardon you will grant, that, at this hour, The bruised remnants of our stricken camp Are huddling undistinguish'd my dear friends, With common thousands, into shallow graves. Otho. Enough, most noble Gersa. You are free To cheer the brave remainder of your host By your own healing presence, and that too, Not as their leader merely, but their king; For, as I hear, the wily enemy, Who eas'd the crownet from your infant brows, Bloody Taraxa, is among the dead. Gersa. Then I retire, so generous Otho please, Bearing with me a weight of benefits Too heavy to be borne. Otho. It is not so; Still understand me, King of Hungary, Nor judge my open purposes awry. Though I did hold you high in my esteem For your self's sake, I do not personate The stage-play emperor to entrap applause, To set the silly sort o' the world agape, And make the politic smile; no, I have heard How in the Council you condemn'd this war, Urging the perfidy of broken faith,â For that I am your friend. Gersa. If ever, sire, You are mine enemy, I dare here swear 'Twill not be Gersa's fault. Otho, farewell! Otho. Will you return, Prince, to our banqueting? Gersa. As to my father's board I will return. Otho. Conrad, with all due ceremony, give The prince a regal escort to his camp; Albert, go thou and bear him company. Gersa, farewell! Gersa. All happiness attend you! Otho. Return with what good speed you may; for soon We must consult upon our terms of peace. [Exeunt Gersa and Albert with others. And thus a marble column do I build To prop my empire's dome. Conrad, in thee I have another stedfast one, to uphold The portals of my state; and, for my own Pre-eminence and safety, I will strive To keep thy strength upon its pedestal. For, without thee, this day I might have been A show-monster about the streets of Prague, In chains, as just now stood that noble prince: And then to me no mercy had been shown, For when the conquer'd lion is once dungeon'd, Who lets him forth again? or dares to give An old lion sugar-cates of mild reprieve? Not to thine ear alone I make confession, But to all here, as, by experience, I know how the great basement of all power Is frankness, and a true tongue to the world; And how intriguing secrecy is proof Of fear and weakness, and a hollow state. Conrad, I owe thee much. Conrad. To kiss that hand, My emperor, is ample recompense, For a mere act of duty. Otho. Thou art wrong; For what can any man on earth do more? We will make trial of your house's welcome, My bright Auranthe! Conrad. How is Friedburg honoured! Enter Ethelbert and six Monks. Ethelbert. The benison of heaven on your head, Imperial Otho! Otho. Who stays me? Speak! Quick! Ethelbert. Pause but one moment, mighty conqueror! Upon the threshold of this house of joy. Otho. Pray, do not prose, good Ethelbert, but speak What is your purpose. Ethelbert. The restoration of some captive maids, Devoted to Heaven's pious ministries, Who, being driven from their religious cells, And kept in thraldom by our enemy, When late this province was a lawless spoil, Still weep amid the wild Hungarian camp, Though hemm'd around by thy victorious arms. Otho. Demand the holy sisterhood in our name From Gersa's tents. Farewell, old Ethelbert. Ethelbert. The saints will bless you for this pious care. Otho. Daughter, your hand; Ludolph's would fit it best. Conrad. Ho! let the music sound! [Music. Ethelbert raises his hands, as in benediction of Otho. Exeunt severally. The scene closes on them. Scene III. âThe Country, with the Castle in the distance. Enter Ludolph and Sigifred. Ludolph. You have my secret; let it not be breath'd. Sigifred. Still give me leave to wonder that the Prince Ludolph and the swift Arab are the same; Still to rejoice that 'twas a German arm Death doing in a turban'd masquerade. Ludolph. The Emperor must not know it, Sigifred. Sigifred. I prythee, why? What happier hour of time Could thy pleas'd star point down upon from heaven With silver index, bidding thee make peace? Ludolph. Still it must not be known, good Sigifred; The star may point oblique. Sigifred. If Otho knew His son to be that unknown Mussulman After whose spurring heels he sent me forth, With one of his well-pleas'd Olympian oaths, The charters of man's greatness, at this hour He would be watching round the castle walls, And, like an anxious warder, strain his sight For the first glimpse of such a son return'dâ Ludolph, that blast of the Hungarians, That Saracenic meteor of the fight, That silent fury, whose fell scymitar Kept danger all aloof from Otho's head, And left him space for wonder. Ludolph. Say no more. Not as a swordsman would I pardon claim, But as a son. The bronz'd centurion, Long toil'd in foreign wars, and whose high deeds Are shaded in a forest of tall spears, Known only to his troop, hath greater plea Of favour with my sire than I can have. Sigifred. My lord, forgive me that I cannot see How this proud temper with clear reason squares. What made you then, with such an anxious love, Hover around that life, whose bitter days You vext with bad revolt? Was 't opium, Or the mad-fumed wine? Nay, do not frown, I rather would grieve with you than upbraid. Ludolph. I do believe you. No, 'twas not to make A father his son's debtor, or to heal His deep heart-sickness for a rebel child. 'Twas done in memory of my boyish days, Poor cancel for his kindness to my youth, For all his calming of my childish griefs, And all his smiles upon my merriment. No, not a thousand foughten fields could sponge Those days paternal from my memory, Though now upon my head he heaps disgrace. Sigifred. My Prince, you think too harshlyâ Ludolph. Can I so? Hath he not gall'd my spirit to the quick? And with a sullen rigour obstinate Pour'd out a phial of wrath upon my faults? Hunted me as the Tartar does the boar, Driven me to the very edge o' the world, And almost put a price upon my head? Sigifred. Remember how he spar'd the rebel lords. Ludolph. Yes, yes, I know he hath a noble nature That cannot trample on the fallen. But his Is not the only proud heart in his realm. He hath wrong'd me, and I have done him wrong; He hath lov'd me, and I have shown him kindness; We should be almost equal. Sigifred. Yet, for all this, I would you had appear'd among those lords, And ta'en his favour. Ludolph. Ha! till now I thought My friend had held poor Ludolph's honour dear. What! would you have me sue before his throne And kiss the courtier's missal, its silk steps? Or hug the golden housings of his steed, Amid a camp, whose steeled swarms I dar'd But yesterday? And, at the trumpet sound, Bow like some unknown mercenary's flag, And lick the soiled grass? No, no, my friend, I would not, I, be pardon'd in the heap, And bless indemnity with all that scum,â Those men I mean, who on my shoulders propp'd Their weak rebellion, winning me with lies, And pitying forsooth my many wrongs; Poor self-deceived wretches, who must think Each one himself a king in embryo, Because some dozen vassals cry'dâmy lord! Cowards, who never knew their little hearts, Till flurried danger held the mirror up, And then they own'd themselves without a blush, Curling, like spaniels, round my father's feet. Such things deserted me and are forgiven, While I, least guilty, am an outcast still, And will be, for I love such fair disgrace. Sigifred. I know the clear truth; so would Otho see, For he is just and noble. Fain would I Be pleader for youâ Ludolph. He'll hear none of it; You know his temper, hot, proud, obstinate; Endanger not yourself so uselessly. I will encounter his thwart spleen myself, To-day, at the Duke Conrad's, where he keeps His crowded state after the victory. There will I be, a most unwelcome guest, And parley with him, as a son should do, Who doubly loathes a father's tyranny; Tell him how feeble is that tyranny; How the relationship of father and son Is no more valid than a silken leash Where lions tug adverse, if love grow not From interchanged love through many years. Aye, and those turreted Franconian walls, Like to a jealous casket, hold my pearlâ My fair Auranthe! Yes, I will be there. Sigifred. Be not so rash; wait till his wrath shall pass, Until his royal spirit softly ebbs Self-influenced; then, in his morning dreams He will forgive thee, and awake in grief To have not thy good morrow. Ludolph. Yes, to-day I must be there, while her young pulses beat Among the new-plum'd minions of the war. Have you seen her of late? No? Auranthe, Franconia's fair sister, 'tis I mean. She should be paler for my troublous daysâ And there it isâmy father's iron lips Have sworn divorcement 'twixt me and my right. Sigifred (aside). Auranthe! I had hop'd this whim had pass'd. Ludolph. And, Sigifred, with all his love of justice, When will he take that grandchild in his arms, That, by my love I swear, shall soon be his? This reconcilement is impossible, For seeâbut who are these? Sigifred. They are messengers From our great emperor; to you, I doubt not, For couriers are abroad to seek you out. Enter Theodore and Gonfred. Theodore. Seeing so many vigilant eyes explore The province to invite your highness back To your high dignities, we are too happy. Gonfred. We have no eloquence to colour justly The emperor's anxious wishes. Ludolph. Go. I follow you. [Exeunt Theodore and Gonfred. I play the prude: it is but venturingâ Why should he be so earnest? Come, my friend, Let us to Friedburg castle. ACT II. Scene I. âAn Ante-chamber in the Castle. Enter Ludolph and Sigifred. Ludolph. No more advices, no more cautioning: I leave it all to fateâto any thing! I cannot square my conduct to time, place, Or circumstance; to me 'tis all a mist! Sigifred. I say no more. Ludolph. It seems I am to wait Here in the ante-room;âthat may be a trifle. You see now how I dance attendance here, Without that tyrant temper, you so blame, Snapping the rein. You have medicin'd me With good advices; and I here remain, In this most honourable ante-room, Your patient scholar. Sigifred. Do not wrong me, Prince. By Heavens, I'd rather kiss Duke Conrad's slipper, When in the morning he doth yawn with pride, Than see you humbled but a half-degree! Truth is, the Emperor would fain dismiss The nobles ere he sees you. Enter Gonfred from the Council-room. Ludolph. Well, sir! what? Gonfred. Great honour to the Prince! The Emperor, Hearing that his brave son had re-appeared, Instant dismiss'd the Council from his sight, As Jove fans off the clouds. Even now they pass. [Exit. Enter the Nobles from the Council-room. They cross the stage, bowing with respect to Ludolph, he frowning on them. Conrad follows. Exeunt Nobles. Ludolph. Not the discoloured poisons of a fen, Which he who breathes feels warning of his death, Could taste so nauseous to the bodily sense, As these prodigious sycophants disgust The soul's fine palate. Conrad. Princely Ludolph, hail! Welcome, thou younger sceptre to the realm! Strength to thy virgin crownet's golden buds, That they, against the winter of thy sire, May burst, and swell, and flourish round thy brows, Maturing to a weighty diadem! Yet be that hour far off; and may he live, Who waits for thee, as the chapp'd earth for rain. Set my life's star! I have lived long enough, Since under my glad roof, propitiously, Father and son each other re-possess. Ludolph. Fine wording, Duke! but words could never yet Forestall the fates; have you not learnt that yet? Let me look well: your features are the same; Your gait the same; your hair of the same shade; As one I knew some passed weeks ago, Who sung far different notes into mine ears. I have mine own particular comments on 't; You have your own, perhaps. Conrad. My gracious Prince, All men may err. In truth I was deceived In your great father's nature, as you were. Had I known that of him I have since known, And what you soon will learn, I would have turn'd My sword to my own throat, rather than held Its threatening edge against a good King's quiet: Or with one word fever'd you, gentle Prince, Who seem'd to me, as rugged times then went, Indeed too much oppress'd. May I be bold To tell the Emperor you will haste to him? Ludolph. Your Dukedom's privilege will grant so much. [Exit Conrad. He's very close to Otho, a tight leech! Your handâI go. Ha! here the thunder comes Sullen against the wind! If in two angry brows My safety lies, then Sigifred, I'm safe. Enter Otho and Conrad. Otho. Will you make Titan play the lackey-page To chattering pigmies? I would have you know That such neglect of our high Majesty Annuls all feel of kindred. What is son,â Or friend,âor brother,âor all ties of blood,â When the whole kingdom, centred in ourself, Is rudely slighted? Who am I to wait? By Peter's chair! I have upon my tongue A word to fright the proudest spirit here!â Death!âand slow tortures to the hardy fool, Who dares take such large charter from our smiles! Conrad, we would be private. Sigifred! Off! And none pass this way on pain of death! [Exeunt Conrad and Sigifred. Ludolph. This was but half expected, my good sire, Yet I am griev'd at it, to the full height, As though my hopes of favour had been whole. Otho. How you indulge yourself! What can you hope for? Ludolph. Nothing, my liege; I have to hope for nothing. I come to greet you as a loving son, And then depart, if I may be so free, Seeing that blood of yours in my warm veins Has not yet mitigated into milk. Otho. What would you, sir? Ludolph. A lenient banishment; So please you let me unmolested pass This Conrad's gates, to the wide air again. I want no more. A rebel wants no more. Otho. And shall I let a rebel loose again To muster kites and eagles 'gainst my head? No, obstinate boy, you shall be kept cag'd up, Serv'd with harsh food, with scum for Sunday-drink. Ludolph. Indeed! Otho. And chains too heavy for your life: I'll choose a gaoler, whose swart monstrous face Shall be a hell to look upon, and sheâ Ludolph. Ha! Otho. Shall be your fair Auranthe. Ludolph. Amaze! Amaze! Otho. To-day you marry her. Ludolph. This is a sharp jest! Otho. No. None at all. When have I said a lie? Ludolph. If I sleep not, I am a waking wretch. Otho. Not a word more. Let me embrace my child. Ludolph. I dare not. 'Twould pollute so good a father! O heavy crime! that your son's blinded eyes Could not see all his parent's love aright, As now I see it. Be not kind to meâ Punish me not with favour. Otho. Are you sure, Ludolph, you have no saving plea in store? Ludolph. My father, none! Otho. Then you astonish me. Ludolph. No, I have no plea. Disobedience, Rebellion, obstinacy, blasphemy, Are all my counsellors. If they can make My crooked deeds show good and plausible, Then grant me loving pardon, but not else, Good Gods! not else, in any way, my liege! Otho. You are a most perplexing, noble boy. Ludolph. You not less a perplexing noble father. Otho. Well, you shall have free passport through the gates. Farewell! Ludolph. Farewell! and by these tears believe, And still remember, I repent in pain All my misdeeds! Otho. Ludolph, I will! I will! But, Ludolph, ere you go, I would enquire If you, in all your wandering, ever met A certain Arab haunting in these parts. Ludolph. No, my good lord, I cannot say I did. Otho. Make not your father blind before his time; Nor let these arms paternal hunger more For an embrace, to dull the appetite Of my great love for thee, my supreme child! Come close, and let me breathe into thine ear. I knew you through disguise. You are the Arab! You can't deny it. [Embracing him. Ludolph. Happiest of days! Otho. We'll make it so. Ludolph. 'Stead of one fatted calf Ten hecatombs shall bellow out their last, Smote 'twixt the horns by the death-stunning mace Of Mars, and all the soldiery shall feast Nobly as Nimrod's masons, when the towers Of Nineveh new kiss'd the parted clouds! Otho. Large as a God speak out, where all is thine. Ludolph. Aye, father, but the fire in my sad breast Is quench'd with inward tears! I must rejoice For you, whose wings so shadow over me In tender victory, but for myself I still must mourn. The fair Auranthe mine! Too great a boon! I prythee let me ask What more than I know of could so have changed Your purpose touching her? Otho. At a word, this: In no deed did you give me more offence Than your rejection of Erminia. To my appalling, I saw too good proof Of your keen-eyed suspicion,âshe is naught! Ludolph. You are convinc'd? Otho. Aye, spite of her sweet looks. O, that my brother's daughter should so fall! Her fame has pass'd into the grosser lips Of soldiers in their cups. Ludolph. 'Tis very sad. Otho. No more of her. AurantheâLudolph, come! This marriage be the bond of endless peace! [Exeunt. Scene II. âThe Entrance of Gersa's Tent in the Hungarian Camp. Enter Erminia. Erminia. Where! where! where shall I find a messenger? A trusty soul? A good man in the camp? Shall I go myself? Monstrous wickedness! O cursed Conrad! devilish Auranthe! Here is proof palpable as the bright sun! O for a voice to reach the Emperor's ears! [Shouts in the Camp. Enter an Hungarian Captain. Captain. Fair prisoner, hear you those joyous shouts? The kingâaye, now our king,âbut still your slave, Young Gersa, from a short captivity Has just return'd. He bids me say, bright Dame, That even the homage of his ranged chiefs Cures not his keen impatience to behold Such beauty once again. What ails you, lady? Erminia. Say, is not that a German, yonder? There! Captain. Methinks by his stout bearing he should beâ Yesâ'tis one Albert; a brave German knight, And much in the emperor's favour. Erminia. I would fain Enquire of friends and kinsfolk; how they fared In these rough times. Brave soldier, as you pass To royal Gersa with my humble thanks, Will you send yonder knight to me? Captain. I will. [Exit. Erminia. Yes, he was ever known to be a man Frank, open, generous; Albert I may trust. O proof! proof! proof! Albert's an honest man; Not Ethelbert the monk, if he were here, Would I hold more trustworthy. Now! Enter Albert. Albert. Good Gods! Lady Erminia! are you prisoner In this beleaguer'd camp? Or are you here Of your own will? You pleas'd to send for me. By Venus, 'tis a pity I knew not Your plight before, and, by her Son, I swear To do you every service you can ask. What would the fairestâ? Erminia. Albert, will you swear? Albert. I have. Well? Erminia. Albert, you have fame to lose. If men, in court and camp, lie not outright, You should be, from a thousand, chosen forth To do an honest deed. Shall I confideâ? Albert. Aye, anything to me, fair creature. Do; Dictate my task. Sweet woman,â Erminia. Truce with that. You understand me not; and, in your speech, I see how far the slander is abroad. Without proof could you think me innocent? Albert. Lady, I should rejoice to know you so. Erminia. If you have any pity for a maid, Suffering a daily death from evil tongues; Any compassion for that Emperor's niece, Who, for your bright sword and clear honesty, Lifted you from the crowd of common men Into the lap of honour;âsave me, knight! Albert. How? Make it clear; if it be possible, I, by the banner of Saint Maurice, swear To right you. Erminia. Possible!âEasy. O my heart! This letter's not so soil'd but you may read it;â Possible! Thereâthat letter! Readâread it. [Gives him a letter. Albert (reading). âTo the Duke Conrad.âForget the threat you made at parting, and I will forget to send the Emperor letters and papers of your's I have become possessed of. His life is no trifle to me; his death you shall find none to yourself.â (Speaks to himself:) 'Tis meâmy life that's pleaded for! (Reads.) âHe, for his own sake, will be dumb as the grave. Erminia has my shame fix'd upon her, sure as a wen. We are safe.Auranthe.â A she-devil! A dragon! I her imp! Fire of Hell! Aurantheâlewd demon! Where got you this? Where? When? Erminia. I found it in the tent, among some spoils Which, being noble, fell to Gersa's lot. Come in, and see. [They go in and return. Albert. Villainy! Villainy! Conrad's sword, his corslet, and his helm, And his letter. Caitiff, he shall feelâ Erminia. I see you are thunderstruck. Haste, haste away! Albert. O I am tortured by this villainy. Erminia. You needs must be. Carry it swift to Otho; Tell him, moreover, I am prisoner Here in this camp, where all the sisterhood, Forc'd from their quiet cells, are parcell'd out For slaves among these Huns. Away! Away! Albert. I am gone. Erminia. Swift be your steed! Within this hour The Emperor will see it. Albert. Ere I sleep: That I can swear. [Hurries out. Gersa (without). Brave captains! thanks. Enough Of loyal homage now! Enter Gersa. Erminia. Hail, royal Hun! Gersa. What means this, fair one? Why in such alarm? Who was it hurried by me so distract? It seem'd you were in deep discourse together; Your doctrine has not been so harsh to him As to my poor deserts. Come, come, be plain. I am no jealous fool to kill you both, Or, for such trifles, rob the adorned world Of such a beauteous vestal. Erminia. I grieve, my Lord, To hear you condescend to ribald phrase. Gersa. This is too much! Hearken, my lady pure! Erminia. Silence! and hear the magic of a nameâ Erminia! I am she,âthe Emperor's niece! Prais'd be the Heavens, I now dare own myself! Gersa. Erminia! Indeed! I've heard of her. Prythee, fair lady, what chance brought you here? Erminia. Ask your own soldiers. Gersa. And you dare own your name. For loveliness you mayâand for the rest My vein is not censorious. Erminia. Alas! poor me! 'Tis false indeed. Gersa. Indeed you are too fair: The swan, soft leaning on her fledgy breast, When to the stream she launches, looks not back With such a tender grace; nor are her wings So white as your soul is, if that but be Twin-picture to your face. Erminia! To-day, for the first day, I am a king, Yet would I give my unworn crown away To know you spotless. Erminia. Trust me one day more, Generously, without more certain guarantee, Than this poor face you deign to praise so much; After that, say and do whate'er you please. If I have any knowledge of you, sir, I think, nay I am sure, you will grieve much To hear my story. O be gentle to me, For I am sick and faint with many wrongs, Tir'd out, and weary-worn with contumelies. Gersa. Poor lady! Enter Ethelbert. Erminia. Gentle Prince, 'tis false indeed. Good morrow, holy father! I have had Your prayers, though I look'd for you in vain. Ethelbert. Blessings upon you, daughter! Sure you look Too cheerful for these foul pernicious days. Young man, you heard this virgin say 'twas false,â 'Tis false, I say. What! can you not employ Your temper elsewhere, 'mong these burly tents, But you must taunt this dove, for she hath lost The Eagle Otho to beat off assault? Fie! fie! But I will be her guard myself; In the Emperor's name. I here demand of you Herself, and all her sisterhood. She false! Gersa. Peace! peace, old man! I cannot think she is. Ethelbert. Whom I have known from her first infancy, Baptiz'd her in the bosom of the Church, Watch'd her, as anxious husbandmen the grain, From the first shoot till the unripe mid-May, Then to the tender ear of her June days, Which, lifting sweet abroad its timid green, Is blighted by the touch of calumny; You cannot credit such a monstrous tale. Gersa. I cannot. Take her. Fair Erminia, I follow you to Friedburg,âis't not so? Erminia. Aye, so we purpose. Ethelbert. Daughter, do you so? How's this? I marvel! Yet you look not mad. Erminia. I have good news to tell you, Ethelbert. Gersa. Ho! ho, there! Guards! Your blessing, father! Sweet Erminia, Believe me, I am well nigh sureâ Erminia. Farewell! Short time will show. [Enter Chiefs. Yes, father Ethelbert, I have news precious as we pass along. Ethelbert. Dear daughter, you shall guide me. Erminia. To no ill. Gersa. Command an escort to the Friedburg lines. [Exeunt Chiefs. Pray let me lead. Fair lady, forget not Gersa, how he believ'd you innocent. I follow you to Friedburg with all speed. [Exeunt. ACT III. Scene I. âThe Country. Enter Albert. Albert. O that the earth were empty, as when Cain Had no perplexity to hide his head! Or that the sword of some brave enemy Had put a sudden stop to my hot breath, And hurl'd me down the illimitable gulph Of times past, unremember'd! Better so Than thus fast-limed in a cursed snare, The white limbs of a wanton. This the end Of an aspiring life! My boyhood past In feud with wolves and bears, when no eye saw The solitary warfare, fought for love Of honour 'mid the growling wilderness. My sturdier youth, maturing to the sword, Won by the syren-trumpets, and the ring Of shields upon the pavement, when bright-mail'd Henry the Fowler pass'd the streets of Prague. Was't to this end I louted and became The menial of Mars, and held a spear Sway'd by command, as corn is by the wind? Is it for this, I now am lifted up By Europe's throned Emperor, to see My honour be my executioner,â My love of fame, my prided honesty Put to the torture for confessional? Then the damn'd crime of blurting to the world A woman's secret!âThough a fiend she be, Too tender of my ignominious life; But then to wrong the generous Emperor In such a searching point, were to give up My soul for foot-ball at Hell's holiday! I must confess,âand cut my throat,âto-day? To-morrow? Ho! some wine! Enter Sigifred. Sigifred. A fine humourâ Albert. Who goes there? Count Sigifred? Ha! Ha! Sigifred. What, man, do you mistake the hollow sky For a throng'd tavern,âand these stubbed trees For old serge hangings,âme, your humble friend, For a poor waiter? Why, man, how you stare! What gipsies have you been carousing with? No, no more wine; methinks you've had enough. Albert. You well may laugh and banter. What a fool An injury may make of a staid man! You shall know all anon. Sigifred. Some tavern brawl? Albert. 'Twas with some people out of common reach; Revenge is difficult. Sigifred. I am your friend; We meet again to-day, and can confer Upon it. For the present I'm in haste. Albert. Whither? Sigifred. To fetch King Gersa to the feast. The Emperor on this marriage is so hot, Pray Heaven it end not in apoplexy! The very porters, as I pass'd the doors, Heard his loud laugh, and answer'd in full choir. I marvel, Albert, you delay so long From those bright revelries; go, show yourself, You may be made a duke. Albert. Aye, very like: Pray, what day has his Highness fix'd upon? Sigifred. For what? Albert. The marriage. What else can I mean? Sigifred. To-day! O, I forgot, you could not know; The news is scarce a minute old with me. Albert. Married to-day! To-day! You did not say so? Sigifred. Now, while I speak to you, their comely heads Are bow'd before the mitre. Albert. O! monstrous! Sigifred. What is this? Albert. Nothing, Sigifred. Farewell! We'll meet upon our subject. Farewell, count! [Exit. Sigifred. Is this clear-headed Albert? He brain-turn'd! 'Tis as portentous as a meteor. [Exit. Scene II. âAn Apartment in the Castle. Enter, as from the Marriage, Otho, Ludolph, Auranthe, Conrad, Nobles, Knights, Ladies, &amp;c. Music. Otho. Now, Ludolph! Now, Auranthe! Daughter fair! What can I find to grace your nuptial day More than my love, and these wide realms in fee? Ludolph. I have too much. Auranthe. And I, my liege, by far. Ludolph. Auranthe! I have! O, my bride, my love! Not all the gaze upon us can restrain My eyes, too long poor exiles from thy face, From adoration, and my foolish tongue From uttering soft responses to the love I see in thy mute beauty beaming forth! Fair creature, bless me with a single word! All mine! Auranthe. Spare, spare me, my Lord; I swoon else. Ludolph. Soft beauty! by to-morrow I should die, Wert thou not mine. [They talk apart. First Lady. How deep she has bewitch'd him! First Knight. Ask you for her recipe for love philtres. Second Lady. They hold the Emperor in admiration. Otho. If ever king was happy, that am I! What are the cities 'yond the Alps to me, The provinces about the Danube's mouth, The promise of fair soil beyond the Rhone; Or routing out of Hyperborean hordes, To these fair children, stars of a new age? Unless perchance I might rejoice to win This little ball of earth, and chuck it them To play with! Auranthe. Nay, my Lord, I do not know. Ludolph. Let me not famish. Otho (to Conrad). Good Franconia, You heard what oath I sware, as the sun rose, That unless Heaven would send me back my son, My Arab,âno soft music should enrich The cool wine, kiss'd off with a soldier's smack; Now all my empire, barter'd for one feast, Seems poverty. Conrad. Upon the neighbour-plain The heralds have prepar'd a royal lists; Your knights, found war-proof in the bloody field, Speed to the game. Otho. Well, Ludolph, what say you? Ludolph. My lord! Otho. A tourney? Conrad. Or, if 't please you bestâ Ludolph. I want no more! First Lady. He soars! Second Lady. Past all reason. Ludolph. Though heaven's choir Should in a vast circumference descend And sing for my delight, I'd stop my ears! Though bright Apollo's car stood burning here, And he put out an arm to bid me mount, His touch an immortality, not I! This earth, this palace, this room, Auranthe! Otho. This is a little painful; just too much. Conrad, if he flames longer in this wise, I shall believe in wizard-woven loves And old romances; but I'll break the spell. Ludolph! Conrad. He will be calm, anon. Ludolph. You call'd? Yes, yes, yes, I offend. You must forgive me; Not being quite recover'd from the stun Of your large bounties. A tourney, is it not? [A senet heard faintly. Conrad. The trumpets reach us. Ethelbert (without). On your peril, sirs, Detain us! First Voice (without). Let not the abbot pass. Second Voice (without). No, On your lives! First Voice (without). Holy father, you must not. Ethelbert (without). Otho! Otho. Who calls on Otho? Ethelbert (without). Ethelbert! Otho. Let him come in. [Enter Ethelbert leading in Erminia. Thou cursed abbot, why Hast brought pollution to our holy rites? Hast thou no fear of hangman, or the faggot? Ludolph. What portentâwhat strange prodigy is this? Conrad. Away! Ethelbert. You, Duke? Erminia. Albert has surely fail'd me! Look at the Emperor's brow upon me bent! Ethelbert. A sad delay! Conrad. Away, thou guilty thing! Ethelbert. You again, Duke? Justice, most mighty Otho! Youâgo to your sister there and plot again, A quick plot, swift as thought to save your heads; For lo! the toils are spread around your den, The world is all agape to see dragg'd forth Two ugly monsters. Ludolph. What means he, my lord? Conrad. I cannot guess. Ethelbert. Best ask your lady sister, Whether the riddle puzzles her beyond The power of utterance. Conrad. Foul barbarian, cease; The Princess faints! Ludolph. Stab him! O, sweetest wife! [Attendants bear off Auranthe. Erminia. Alas! Ethelbert. Your wife? Ludolph. Aye, Satan! does that yerk ye? Ethelbert. Wife! so soon! Ludolph. Aye, wife! Oh, impudence! Thou bitter mischief! Venomous mad priest! How dar'st thou lift those beetle brows at me? Meâthe prince Ludolph, in this presence here, Upon my marriage-day, and scandalize My joys with such opprobrious surprise? Wife! Why dost linger on that syllable, As if it were some demon's name pronounc'd To summon harmful lightning, and make roar The sleepy thunder? Hast no sense of fear? No ounce of man in thy mortality? Tremble! for, at my nod, the sharpen'd axe Will make thy bold tongue quiver to the roots, Those grey lids wink, and thou not know it more! Ethelbert. O, poor deceived Prince! I pity thee! Great Otho! I claim justiceâ Ludolph. Thou shalt have 't! Thine arms from forth a pulpit of hot fire Shall sprawl distracted! O that that dull cowl Were some most sensitive portion of thy life, That I might give it to my hounds to tear! Thy girdle some fine zealous-pained nerve To girth my saddle! And those devil's beads Each one a life, that I might, every day, Crush one with Vulcan's hammer! Otho. Peace, my son; You far outstrip my spleen in this affair. Let us be calm, and hear the abbot's plea For this intrusion. Ludolph. I am silent, sire. Otho. Conrad, see all depart not wanted here. [Exeunt Knights, Ladies, &amp;c. Ludolph, be calm. Ethelbert, peace awhile. This mystery demands an audience Of a just judge, and that will Otho be. Ludolph. Why has he time to breathe another word? Otho. Ludolph, old Ethelbert, be sure, comes not To beard us for no cause; he's not the man To cry himself up an ambassador Without credentials. Ludolph. I'll chain up myself. Otho. Old Abbot, stand here forth. Lady Erminia, Sit. And now, Abbot! what have you to say? Our ear is open. First we here denounce Hard penalties against thee, if't be found The cause for which you have disturb'd us here, Making our bright hours muddy, be a thing Of little moment. Ethelbert. See this innocent! Otho! thou father of the people call'd, Is her life nothing? Her fair honour nothing? Her tears from matins until even-song Nothing? Her burst heart nothing? Emperor! Is this your gentle nieceâthe simplest flower Of the world's herbalâthis fair lilly blanch'd Still with the dews of piety, this meek lady Here sitting like an angel newly-shent, Who veils its snowy wings and grows all pale,â Is she nothing? Otho. What more to the purpose, abbot? Ludolph. Whither is he winding? Conrad. No clue yet! Ethelbert. You have heard, my Liege, and so, no doubt, all here, Foul, poisonous, malignant whisperings; Nay open speech, rude mockery grown common, Against the spotless nature and clear fame Of the princess Erminia, your niece. I have intruded here thus suddenly, Because I hold those base weeds, with tight hand, Which now disfigure her fair growing stem, Waiting but for your sign to pull them up By the dark roots, and leave her palpable, To all men's sight, a Lady, innocent. The ignominy of that whisper'd tale About a midnight gallant, seen to climb A window to her chamber neighbour'd near, I will from her turn off, and put the load On the right shoulders; on that wretch's head, Who, by close stratagems, did save herself, Chiefly by shifting to this lady's room A rope-ladder for false witness. Ludolph. Most atrocious! Otho. Ethelbert, proceed. Ethelbert. With sad lips I shall: For, in the healing of one wound, I fear To make a greater. His young highness here To-day was married. Ludolph. Good. Ethelbert. Would it were good! Yet why do I delay to spread abroad The names of those two vipers, from whose jaws A deadly breath went forth to taint and blast This guileless lady? Otho. Abbot, speak their names. Ethelbert. A minute first. It cannot beâbut may I ask, great judge, if you to-day have put A letter by unread? Otho. Does't end in this? Conrad. Out with their names! Ethelbert. Bold sinner, say you so? Ludolph. Out, tedious monk! Otho. Confess, or by the wheelâ Ethelbert. My evidence cannot be far away; And, though it never come, be on my head The crime of passing an attaint upon The slanderers of this virgin. Ludolph. Speak aloud! Ethelbert. Auranthe, and her brother there. Conrad. Amaze! Ludolph. Throw them from the windows! Otho. Do what you will! Ludolph. What shall I do with them? Something of quick dispatch, for should she hear, My soft Auranthe, her sweet mercy would Prevail against my fury. Damned priest! What swift death wilt thou die? As to the lady I touch her not. Ethelbert. Illustrious Otho, stay! An ample store of misery thou hast, Choak not the granary of thy noble mind With more bad bitter grain, too difficult A cud for the repentance of a man Grey-growing. To thee only I appeal, Not to thy noble son, whose yeasting youth Will clear itself, and crystal turn again. A young man's heart, by Heaven's blessing, is A wide world, where a thousand new-born hopes Empurple fresh the melancholy blood: But an old man's is narrow, tenantless Of hopes, and stuff'd with many memories, Which, being pleasant, ease the heavy pulseâ Painful, clog up and stagnate. Weigh this matter Even as a miser balances his coin; And, in the name of mercy, give command That your knight Albert be brought here before you. He will expound this riddle; he will show A noon-day proof of bad Auranthe's guilt. Otho. Let Albert straight be summon'd. [Exit one of the Nobles. Ludolph. Impossible! I cannot doubtâI will notânoâto doubt Is to be ashes!âwither'd up to death! Otho. My gentle Ludolph, harbour not a fear; You do yourself much wrong. Ludolph. O, wretched dolt! Now, when my foot is almost on thy neck, Wilt thou infuriate me? Proof! Thou fool! Why wilt thou teaze impossibility With such a thick-skull'd persevering suit? Fanatic obstinacy! Prodigy! Monster of folly! Ghost of a turn'd brain! You puzzle me,âyou haunt me,âwhen I dream Of you my brain will split! Bald sorcerer! Juggler! May I come near you? On my soul I know not whether to pity, curse, or laugh. Enter Albert, and the Nobleman. Here, Albert, this old phantom wants a proof! Give him his proof! A camel's load of proofs! Otho. Albert, I speak to you as to a man Whose words once utter'd pass like current gold; And therefore fit to calmly put a close To this brief tempest. Do you stand possess'd Of any proof against the honourableness Of Lady Auranthe, our new-spoused daughter? Albert. You chill me with astonishment. How's this? My Liege, what proof should I have 'gainst a fame Impossible of slur? [Otho rises. Erminia. O wickedness! Ethelbert. Deluded monarch, 'tis a cruel lie. Otho. Peace, rebel-priest! Conrad. Insult beyond credence! Erminia. Almost a dream! Ludolph. We have awaken'd from A foolish dream that from my brow hath wrung A wrathful dew. O folly! why did I So act the lion with this silly gnat? Let them depart. Lady Erminia! I ever griev'd for you, as who did not? But now you have, with such a brazen front, So most maliciously, so madly striven To dazzle the soft moon, when tenderest clouds Should be unloop'd around to curtain her; I leave you to the desert of the world Almost with pleasure. Let them be set free For me! I take no personal revenge More than against a nightmare, which a man Forgets in the new dawn. [Exit Ludolph. Otho. Still in extremes! No, they must not be loose. Ethelbert. Albert, I must suspect thee of a crime So fiendishâ Otho. Fear'st thou not my fury, monk? Conrad, be they in your sure custody Till we determine some fit punishment. It is so mad a deed, I must reflect And question them in private; for perhaps, By patient scrutiny, we may discover Whether they merit death, or should be placed In care of the physicians. [Exeunt Otho and Nobles, Albert following. Conrad. My guards, ho! Erminia. Albert, wilt thou follow there? Wilt thou creep dastardly behind his back, And slink away from a weak woman's eye? Turn, thou court-Janus! thou forget'st thyself; Here is the Duke, waiting with open arms, [Enter Guards. To thank thee; here congratulate each other; Wring hands; embrace; and swear how lucky 'twas That I, by happy chance, hit the right man Of all the world to trust in. Albert. Trust! to me! Conrad (aside). He is the sole one in this mystery. Erminia. Well, I give up, and save my prayers for Heaven! You, who could do this deed, would ne'er relent, Though, at my words, the hollow prison-vaults Would groan for pity. Conrad. Manacle them both! Ethelbert. I know itâit must beâI see it all! Albert, thou art the minion! Erminia. Ah! too plainâ Conrad. Silence! Gag up their mouths! I cannot bear More of this brawling. That the Emperor Had plac'd you in some other custody! Bring them away. [Exeunt all but Albert. Albert. Though my name perish from the book of honour, Almost before the recent ink is dry, And be no more remember'd after death, Than any drummer's in the muster-roll; Yet shall I season high my sudden fall With triumph o'er that evil-witted duke! He shall feel what it is to have the hand Of a man drowning, on his hateful throat. Enter Gersa and Sigifred. Gersa. What discord is at ferment in this house? Sigifred. We are without conjecture; not a soul We met could answer any certainty. Gersa. Young Ludolph, like a fiery arrow, shot By us. Sigifred. The Emperor, with cross'd arms, in thought. Gersa. In one room music, in another sadness, Perplexity every where! Albert. A trifle more! Follow; your presences will much avail To tune our jarred spirits. I'll explain. [Exeunt. ACT IV. Scene I. âAuranthe's Apartment. Auranthe and Conrad discovered. Conrad. Well, well, I know what ugly jeopardy We are cag'd in; you need not pester that Into my ears. Prythee, let me be spared A foolish tongue, that I may bethink me Of remedies with some deliberation. You cannot doubt but 'tis in Albert's power To crush or save us? Auranthe. No, I cannot doubt. He has, assure yourself, by some strange means, My secret; which I ever hid from him, Knowing his mawkish honesty. Conrad. Curs'd slave! Auranthe. Ay, I could almost curse him now myself. Wretched impediment! Evil genius! A glue upon my wings, that cannot spread, When they should span the provinces! A snake, A scorpion, sprawling on the first gold step, Conducting to the throne, high canopied. Conrad. You would not hear my council, when his life Might have been trodden out, all sure and hush'd; Now the dull animal forsooth must be Intreated, managed! When can you contrive The interview he demands? Auranthe. As speedily It must be done as my brib'd woman can Unseen conduct him to me; but I fear 'Twill be impossible, while the broad day Comes through the panes with persecuting glare. Methinks, if 't now were night I could intrigue With darkness, bring the stars to second me, And settle all this trouble. Conrad. Nonsense! Child! See him immediately; why not now? Auranthe. Do you forget that even the senseless door-posts Are on the watch and gape through all the house? How many whisperers there are about, Hungry for evidence to ruin me; Men I have spurn'd, and women I have taunted? Besides, the foolish prince sends, minute whiles, His pagesâso they tell meâto enquire After my health, entreating, if I please, To see me. Conrad. Well, suppose this Albert here; What is your power with him? Auranthe. He should be My echo, my taught parrot! but I fear He will be cur enough to bark at me; Have his own say; read me some silly creed 'Bout shame and pity. Conrad. What will you do then? Auranthe. What I shall do, I know not: what I would Cannot be done; for see, this chamber-floor Will not yield to the pick-axe and the spade,â Here is no quiet depth of hollow ground. Conrad. Sister, you have grown sensible and wise, Seconding, ere I speak it, what is now, I hope, resolv'd between us. Auranthe. Say, what is 't? Conrad. You need not be his sexton too: a man May carry that with him shall make him die Elsewhere,âgive that to him; pretend the while You will to-morrow succumb to his wishes, Be what they may, and send him from the Castle On some fool's errand; let his latest groan Frighten the wolves! Auranthe. Alas! he must not die! Conrad. Would you were both hears'd up in stifling lead! Detestedâ Auranthe. Conrad, hold! I would not bear The little thunder of your fretful tongue, Tho' I alone were taken in these toils, And you could free me; but remember, sir, You live alone in my security: So keep your wits at work, for your own sake, Not mine, and be more mannerly. Conrad. Thou wasp! If my domains were emptied of these folk, And I had thee to starveâ Auranthe. O, marvellous! But Conrad, now be gone; the Host is look'd for; Cringe to the Emperor, entertain the Lords, And, do ye mind, above all things, proclaim My sickness, with a brother's sadden'd eye, Condoling with Prince Ludolph. In fit time Return to me. Conrad. I leave you to your thoughts. [Exit. Auranthe (sola). Down, down, proud temper! down, Auranthe's pride! Why do I anger him when I should kneel? Conrad! Albert! help! help! What can I do? O wretched woman! lost, wreck'd, swallow'd up, Accursed, blasted! O, thou golden Crown, Orbing along the serene firmament Of a wide empire, like a glowing moon; And thou, bright sceptre! lustrous in my eyes,â Thereâas the fabled fair Hesperian tree, Bearing a fruit more precious! graceful thing, Delicate, godlike, magic! must I leave Thee to melt in the visionary air, Ere, by one grasp, this common hand is made Imperial? I do not know the time When I have wept for sorrow; but methinks I could now sit upon the ground, and shed Tears, tears of misery. O, the heavy day! How shall I bear my life till Albert comes? Ludolph! Erminia! Proofs! O heavy day! Bring me some mourning weeds, that I may 'tire Myself, as fits one wailing her own death: Cut off these curls, and brand this lilly hand, And throw these jewels from my loathing sight,â Fetch me a missal, and a string of beads,â A cup of bitter'd water, and a crust,â I will confess, O holy Abbot!âHow! What is this? Auranthe! thou fool, dolt, Whimpering idiot! up! up! act and quell! I am safe! Coward! why am I in fear? Albert! he cannot stickle, chew the cud In such a fine extreme,âimpossible! Who knocks? [Goes to the Door, listens, and opens it. Enter Albert. Albert, I have been waiting for you here With such an aching heart, such swooning throbs On my poor brain, such cruelâcruel sorrow, That I should claim your pity! Art not well? Albert. Yes, lady, well. Auranthe. You look not so, alas! But pale, as if you brought some heavy news. Albert. You know full well what makes me look so pale. Auranthe. No! Do I? Surely I am still to learn Some horror; all I know, this present, is I am near hustled to a dangerous gulph, Which you can save me from,âand therefore safe, So trusting in thy love; that should not make Thee pale, my Albert. Albert. It doth make me freeze. Auranthe. Why should it, love? Albert. You should not ask me that, But make your own heart monitor, and save Me the great pain of telling. You must know. Auranthe. Something has vext you, Albert. There are times When simplest things put on a sombre cast; A melancholy mood will haunt a man, Until most easy matters take the shape Of unachievable tasks; small rivulets Then seem impassable. Albert. Do not cheat yourself With hope that gloss of words, or suppliant action, Or tears, or ravings, or self-threaten'd death, Can alter my resolve. Auranthe. You make me tremble; Not so much at your threats, as at your voice, Untun'd, and harsh, and barren of all love. Albert. You suffocate me! Stop this devil's parley, And listen to me; know me once for all. Auranthe. I thought I did. Alas! I am deceiv'd. Albert. No, you are not deceiv'd. You took me for A man detesting all inhuman crime; And therefore kept from me your demon's plot Against Erminia. Silent? Be so still; For ever! Speak no more; but hear my words, Thy fate. Your safety I have bought to-day By blazoning a lie, which in the dawn I'll expiate with truth. Auranthe. O cruel traitor! Albert. For I would not set eyes upon thy shame; I would not see thee dragg'd to death by the hair, Penanc'd, and taunted on a scaffolding! To-night, upon the skirts of the blind wood That blackens northward of these horrid towers, I wait for you with horses. Choose your fate. Farewell. Auranthe. Albert, you jest; I'm sure you must. You, an ambitious Soldier! I, a Queen, One who could say,âHere, rule these Provinces! Take tribute from those cities for thyself! Empty these armouries, these treasuries, Muster thy warlike thousands at a nod! Go! conquer Italy! Albert. Auranthe, you have made The whole world chaff to me. Your doom is fix'd. Auranthe. Out, villain! dastard! Albert. Look there to the door! Who is it? Auranthe. Conrad, traitor! Albert. Let him in. [Enter Conrad. Do not affect amazement, hypocrite, At seeing me in this chamber. Conrad. Auranthe? Albert. Talk not with eyes, but speak your curses out Against me, who would sooner crush and grind A brace of toads, than league with them to oppress An innocent lady, gull an Emperor, More generous to me than autumn's sun To ripening harvests. Auranthe. No more insult, sir! Albert. Aye, clutch your scabbard; but, for prudence sake, Draw not the sword; 'twould make an uproar, Duke, You would not hear the end of. At nightfall Your lady sister, if I guess aright, Will leave this busy castle. You had best Take farewell too of worldly vanities. Conrad. Vassal! Albert. To-morrow, when the Emperor sends For loving Conrad, see you fawn on him. Good even! Auranthe. You'll be seen! Albert. See the coast clear then. Auranthe. (as he goes). Remorseless Albert! Cruel, cruel wretch! [She lets him out. Conrad. So, we must lick the dust? Auranthe. I follow him. Conrad. How? Where? The plan of your escape? Auranthe. He waits For me with horses by the forest-side, Northward. Conrad. Good, good! he dies. You go, say you? Auranthe. Perforce. Conrad. Be speedy, darkness! Till that comes, Fiends keep you company! [Exit. Auranthe. And you! And you! And all men! Vanish! [Retires to an inner Apartment. Scene II. âAn Apartment in the Castle. Enter Ludolph and Page. Page. Still very sick, my Lord; but now I went Knowing my duty to so good a Prince; And there her women in a mournful throng Stood in the passage whispering: if any Mov'd 'twas with careful steps and hush'd as death; They bid me stop. Ludolph. Good fellow, once again Make soft enquiry; prythee be not stay'd By any hindrance, but with gentlest force Break through her weeping servants, till thou com'st E'en to her chamber door, and there, fair boy, If with thy mother's milk thou hast suck'd in Any diviner eloquence; woo her ears With plaints for me more tender than the voice Of dying Echo, echoed. Page. Kindest master! To know thee sad thus, will unloose my tongue In mournful syllables. Let but my words reach Her ears and she shall take them coupled with Moans from my heart and sighs not counterfeit. May I speed better! [Exit Page. Ludolph. Auranthe! My Life! Long have I lov'd thee, yet till now not lov'd: Remembering, as I do, hard-hearted times When I had heard even of thy death perhaps, And thoughtless, suffered to pass alone Into Elysium! now I follow thee A substance or a shadow, wheresoe'er Thou leadest me,âwhether thy white feet press, With pleasant weight, the amorous-aching earth. Or thro' the air thou pioneerest me, A shade! Yet sadly I predestinate! O unbenignest Love, why wilt thou let Darkness steal out upon the sleepy world So wearily; as if night's chariot wheels Were clog'd in some thick cloud. O, changeful Love, Let not her steeds with drowsy-footed pace Pass the high stars, before sweet embassage Comes from the pillow'd beauty of that fair Completion of all delicate nature's wit. Pout her faint lips anew with rubious health And with thine infant fingers lift the fringe Of her sick eyelids; that those eyes may glow With wooing light upon me, ere the Morn Peers with disrelish, grey, barren, and cold. Enter Gersa and Courtiers. Otho calls me his Lionâshould I blush To be so tam'd, soâ Gersa. Do me the courtesy Gentlemen to pass on. Courtier. We are your servants. [Exeunt Courtiers. Ludolph. It seems then, Sir, you have found out the man You would confer with; me? Gersa. If I break not Too much upon your thoughtful mood, I will Claim a brief while your patience. Ludolph. For what cause Soe'er I shall be honour'd. Gersa. I not less. Ludolph. What may it be? No trifle can take place Of such deliberate prologue, serious 'haviour. But be it what it may I cannot fail To listen with no common interestâ For though so new your presence is to me, I have a soldier's friendship for your fameâ Please you explain. Gersa. As thusâfor, pardon me, I cannot in plain terms grossly assault A noble nature; and would faintly sketch What your quick apprehension will fill up So finely I esteem you. Ludolph. I attendâ Gersa. Your generous Father, most illustrious Otho, Sits in the Banquet room among his chiefsâ His wine is bitter, for you are not thereâ His eyes are fix'd still on the open doors, And every passer in he frowns upon Seeing no Ludolph comes. Ludolph. I do neglectâ Gersa. And for your absence, may I guess the cause? Ludolph. Stay there! noâguess? more princely you must beâ Than to make guesses at me. 'Tis enough, I'm sorry I can hear no more. Gersa. And I As griev'd to force it on you so abrupt; Yet one day you must know a grief whose sting Will sharpen more the longer 'tis conceal'd. Ludolph. Say it at once, sir, dead, dead, is she dead? Gersa. Mine is a cruel task: she is not deadâ And would for your sake she were innocentâ Ludolph. Thou liest! thou amazest me beyond All scope of thought; convulsest my heart's blood To deadly churningâGersa you are young As I am; let me observe you face to face; Not grey-brow'd like the poisonous Ethelbert, No rheumed eyes, no furrowing of age, No wrinkles where all vices nestle in Like crannied verminâno, but fresh and young And hopeful featur'd. Ha! by heaven you weep Tears, human tearsâDo you repent you then Of a curs'd torturer's office! Why shouldst joinâ Tell me, the league of Devils? Confessâconfess The Lie.â Gersa. Lie!âbut begone all ceremonious points Of honour battailous. I could not turn My wrath against thee for the orbed world. Ludolph. Your wrath, weak boy? Tremble at mine unless Retraction follow close upon the heels Of that late stounding insult: why has my sword Not done already a sheer judgment on thee? Despair, or eat thy words. Why, thou wast nigh Whimpering away my reason: hark ye, Sir, It is no secret;âthat Erminia, Erminia, Sir, was hidden in your tent; O bless'd asylum! comfortable home! Begone, I pity thee, thou art a Gullâ Erminia's last new puppetâ Gersa. Furious fire! Thou mak'st me boil as hot as thou canst flame! And in thy teeth I give thee back the lie! Thou liest! Thou, Auranthe's fool, a wittolâ Ludolph. Look! look at this bright sword; There is no part of it to the very hilt But shall indulge itself about thine heartâ Drawâbut remember thou must cower thy plumes, As yesterday the Arab made thee stoopâ Gersa. Patience! not here, I would not spill thy blood Here underneath this roof where Otho breathes, Thy fatherâalmost mineâ Ludolph. O faltering cowardâ Re-enter Page. Stay, stay, here is one I have half a word withâ WellâWhat ails thee child? Page. My lord, Ludolph. Good fellow! Page. They are fled! Ludolph. Theyâwho? Page. When anxiously I hasten'd back, your grieving messenger, I found the stairs all dark, the lamps extinct, And not a foot or whisper to be heard. I thought her dead, and on the lowest step Sat listening; when presently came by Two muffled up,âone sighing heavily, The other cursing low, whose voice I knew For the Duke Conrad's. Close I follow'd them Thro' the dark ways they chose to the open air; And, as I follow'd, heard my lady speak. Ludolph. Thy life answers the truth! Page. The chamber's empty! Ludolph. As I will be of mercy! So, at last, This nail is in my temples! Gersa. Be calm in this. Ludolph. I am. Gersa. And Albert too has disappear'd; Ere I met you, I sought him everywhere; You would not hearken. Ludolph. Which way went they, boy? Gersa. I'll hunt with you. Ludolph. No, no, no. My senses are Still whole. I have surviv'd. My arm is strongâ My appetite sharpâfor revenge! I'll no sharer In my feast; my injury is all my own, And so is my revenge, my lawful chattels! Terrier, ferret them out! Burnâburn the witch! Trace me their footsteps! Away! [Exeunt. ACT V. Scene I. âA part of the Forest. Enter Conrad and Auranthe. Auranthe. Go no further; not a step more; thou art A master-plague in the midst of miseries. GoâI fear thee. I tremble every limb, Who never shook before. There's moody death In thy resolved looksâYes, I could kneel To pray thee far away. Conrad, go, goâ There! yonder underneath the boughs I see Our horses! Conrad. Aye, and the man. Auranthe. Yes, he is there. Go, go,âno blood, no blood; go, gentle Conrad! Conrad. Farewell! Auranthe. Farewell, for this Heaven pardon you. [Exit Auranthe. Conrad. If he survive one hour, then may I die In unimagined torturesâor breathe through A long life in the foulest sink of the world! He diesâ'tis well she do not advertise The caitiff of the cold steel at his back. [Exit Conrad. Enter Ludolph and Page. Ludolph. Miss'd the way, boy, say not that on your peril! Page. Indeed, indeed I cannot trace them further. Ludolph. Must I stop here? Here solitary die? Stifled beneath the thick oppressive shade Of these dull boughs,âthis oven of dark thickets,â Silent,âwithout revenge?âpshaw!âbitter end,â A bitter death,âa suffocating death,â A gnawingâsilentâdeadly, quiet death! Escap'd?âfled?âvanish'd? melted into air? She's gone! I cannot clutch her! no revenge! A muffled death, ensnar'd in horrid silence! Suck'd to my grave amid a dreamy calm! O, where is that illustrious noise of war, To smother up this sound of labouring breath, This rustle of the trees! [Auranthe shrieks at a distance. Page. My Lord, a noise! This wayâhark! Ludolph. Yes, yes! A hope! A music! A glorious clamour! How I live again! [Exeunt. Scene II. âAnother part of the Forest. Enter Albert (wounded). Albert. O for enough life to support me on To Otho's feetâ Enter Ludolph. Ludolph. Thrice villainous, stay there! Tell me where that detested woman is Or this is through thee! Albert. My good Prince, with me The sword has done its worst; not without worst Done to anotherâConrad has it homeâ I see you know it allâ Ludolph. Where is his sister? Auranthe rushes in. Auranthe. Albert! Ludolph. Ha! There! there!âHe is the paramour!â Thereâhug himâdying! O, thou innocence, Shrine him and comfort him at his last gasp, Kiss down his eyelids! Was he not thy love? Wilt thou forsake him at his latest hour? Keep fearful and aloof from his last gaze, His most uneasy moments, when cold death Stands with the door ajar to let him in? Albert. O that that door with hollow slam would close Upon me sudden, for I cannot meet, In all the unknown chambers of the dead, Such horrorsâ Ludolph. Auranthe! what can he mean? What horrors? Is it not a joyous time? Am I not married to a paragon âOf personal beauty and untainted soul?â A blushing fair-eyed Purity! A Sylph, Whose snowy timid hand has never sin'd Beyond a flower pluck'd, white as itself? Albert, you do insult my Brideâyour Mistressâ To talk of horrors on our wedding night. Albert. Alas! poor Prince, I would you knew my heart. 'Tis not so guiltyâ Ludolph. Hear you he pleads not guiltyâ You are not? or if so what matters it? You have escap'd me,âfree as the dusk airâ Hid in the forestâsafe from my revenge; I cannot catch youâYou should laugh at me, Poor cheated Ludolph,âmake the forest hiss With jeers at meâYou tremble; faint at once, You will come to again. O Cockatrice, I have you. Whither wander those fair eyes To entice the Devil to your help, that he May change you to a Spider, so to crawl Into some cranny to escape my wrath? Albert. Sometimes the counsel of a dying man Doth operate quietly when his breath is goneâ Disjoin those handsâpartâpart, do not destroy Each otherâforget herâour miseries Are equal shar'd, and mercy isâ Ludolph. A boon When one can compass it. Auranthe, try Your oratoryâyour breath is not so hitch'dâ Aye, stare for helpâ [Albert groans and dies. There goes a spotted soul Howling in vain along the hollow nightâ Hear himâhe calls youâSweet Auranthe, come! Auranthe. Kill me. Ludolph. No! What? upon our Marriage-night! The earth would shudder at so foul a deedâ A fair Bride, a sweet Bride, an innocent Bride! No, we must revel it, as 'tis in use In times of delicate brilliant ceremony: Come, let me lead you to our halls againâ Nay, linger notâmake no resistance sweetâ Will youâAh wretch, thou canst not, for I have The strength of twenty lions 'gainst a lambâ Now one adieu for Albertâcome away.â [Exeunt. Scene III. âAn inner Court of the Castle. Enter Sigifred, Gonfred, and Theodore meeting. Theodore. Was ever such a night? Sigifred. What horrors more? Things unbeliev'd one hour, so strange they are, The next hour stamps with credit. Theodore. Your last news? Gonfred. After the Page's story of the death Of Albert and Duke Conrad? Sigifred. And the return Of Ludolph with the Princess. Gonfred. No more save Prince Gersa's freeing Abbot Ethelbert, And the sweet lady, fair Erminia, From prison. Theodore. Where are they now? hast yet heard? Gonfred. With the sad Emperor they are closeted; I saw the three pass slowly up the stairs, The lady weeping, the old Abbot cowl'd. Sigifred. What next? Theodore. I ache to think on't. Gonfred. 'Tis with fate. Theodore. One while these proud towers are hush'd as death. Gonfred. The next our poor Prince fills the arched rooms With ghastly ravings. Sigifred. I do fear his brain. Gonfred. I will see more. Bear you so stout a heart? [Exeunt into the Castle. Scene IV. âA Cabinet, opening towards a Terrace. Otho, Erminia, Ethelbert, and a Physician, discovered. Otho. O, my poor Boy! my Son! my Son! my Ludolph! Have ye no comfort for me, ye Physicians Of the weak Body and Soul? Ethelbert. 'Tis not the Medicine Either of heaven or earth can cure unless Fit time be chosen to administerâ Otho. A kind forbearance, holy Abbotâcome Erminia, here sit by me, gentle Girl; Give me thy handâhast thou forgiven me? Erminia. Would I were with the saints to pray for you! Otho. Why will ye keep me from my darling child? Physician. Forgive me, but he must not see thy faceâ Otho. Is then a father's countenance a Gorgon? Hath it not comfort in it? Would it not Console my poor Boy, cheer him, heal his spirits? Let me embrace him, let me speak to himâ I willâwho hinders me? Who's Emperor? Physician. You may not, Sireâ'twould overwhelm him quite, He is so full of grief and passionate wrath, Too heavy a sigh would kill himâor do worse. He must be sav'd by fine contrivancesâ And most especially we must keep clear Out of his sight a Father whom he lovesâ His heart is full, it can contain no more, And do its ruddy office. Ethelbert. Sage advice; We must endeavour how to ease and slacken The tight-wound energies of his despair, Not make them tenserâ Otho. Enough! I hear, I hear. Yet you were about to advise moreâI listen. Ethelbert. This learned doctor will agree with me, That not in the smallest point should he be thwarted Or gainsaid by one wordâhis very motions, Nods, becks and hints, should be obey'd with care, Even on the moment: so his troubled mind May cure itselfâ Physician. There is no other means. Otho. Open the door: let's hear if all is quietâ Physician. Beseech you, Sire, forbear. Erminia. Do, do. Otho. I command! Open it straightâhush!âquietâmy lost Boy! My miserable Child! Ludolph (indistinctly without). Fill, fill my goblet,â Here's a health! Erminia. O, close the door! Otho. Let, let me hear his voice; this cannot lastâ And fain would I catch up his dying words Though my own knell they beâthis cannot lastâ O let me catch his voiceâfor lo! I hear This silence whisper me that he is dead! It is so. Gersa? Enter Gersa. Physician. Say, how fares the prince? Gersa. More calmâhis features are less wild and flush'dâ Once he complain'd of wearinessâ Physician. Indeed! 'Tis goodâ'tis goodâlet him but fall asleep, That saves him. Otho. Gersa, watch him like a childâ Ward him from harmâand bring me better newsâ Physician. Humour him to the height. I fear to go; For should he catch a glimpse of my dull garb, It might affright himâfill him with suspicion That we believe him sick, which must not beâ Gersa. I will invent what soothing means I can. [Exit Gersa. Physician. This should cheer up your Highnessâweariness Is a good symptom, and most favourableâ It gives me pleasant hopes. Please you walk forth Onto the Terrace; the refreshing air Will blow one half of your sad doubts away. [Exeunt. Scene V. A Banqueting Hall, brilliantly illuminated, and set forth with all costly magnificence, with Supper-tables, laden with services of Gold and Silver. A door in the back scene, guarded by two Soldiers. Lords, Ladies, Knights, Gentlemen, &amp;c., whispering sadly, and ranging themselves; part entering and part discovered. First Knight. Grievously are we tantaliz'd, one and allâ Sway'd here and there, commanded to and fro As though we were the shadows of a dream And link'd to a sleeping fancy. What do we here? Gonfred. I am no Seerâyou know we must obey The prince from A to Zâthough it should be To set the place in flames. I pray hast heard Where the most wicked Princess is? First Knight. There, Sir, In the next roomâhave you remark'd those two Stout soldiers posted at the door? Gonfred. For what? [They whisper. First Lady. How ghast a train! Second Lady. Sure this should be some splendid burial. First Lady. What fearful whispering! See, seeâGersa there! Enter Gersa. Gersa. Put on your brightest looks; smile if you can; Behave as all were happy; keep your eyes From the least watch upon him; if he speaks To any one, answer collectedly, Without surprise, his questions, howe'er strange. Do this to the utmost,âthough, alas! with me The remedy grows hopeless! Here he comes,â Observe what I have said,âshow no surprise. Enter Ludolph, followed by Sigifred and Page. Ludolph. A splendid company! rare beauties here! I should have Orphean lips, and Plato's fancy, Amphion's utterance, toned with his lyre, Or the deep key of Jove's sonorous mouth, To give fit salutation. Methought I heard, As I came in, some whispers,âwhat of that? 'Tis natural men should whisper; at the kiss Of Psyche given by Love, there was a buzz Among the gods!âand silence is as natural. These draperies are fine, and, being a mortal, I should desire no better; yet, in truth, There must be some superior costliness, Some wider-domed high magnificence! I would have, as a mortal I may not, Hanging of heaven's clouds, purple and gold, Slung from the spheres; gauzes of silver mist, Loop'd up with cords of twisted wreathed light, And tassell'd round with weeping meteors! These pendent lamps and chandeliers are bright As earthly fires from dull dross can be cleansed; Yet could my eyes drink up intenser beams Undazzled,âthis is darkness,âwhen I close These lids, I see far fiercer brilliances,â Skies full of splendid moons, and shooting stars, And spouting exhalations, diamond fires, And panting fountains quivering with deep glows! Yesâthis is darkâis it not dark? Sigifred. My Lord, 'Tis late; the lights of festival are ever Quench'd in the morn. Ludolph. 'Tis not to-morrow then? Sigifred. 'Tis early dawn. Gersa. Indeed full time we slept; Say you so, Prince? Ludolph. I say I quarrell'd with you; We did not tilt each other,âthat's a blessing,â Good gods! no innocent blood upon my head! Sigifred. Retire, Gersa! Ludolph. There should be three more here: For two of them, they stay away perhaps, Being gloomy-minded, haters of fair revels,â They know their own thoughts best. As for the third, Deep blue eyesâsemi-shaded in white lids, Finish'd with lashes fine for more soft shade, Completed by her twin-arch'd ebon browsâ White temples of exactest elegance, Of even mould felicitous and smoothâ Cheeks fashion'd tenderly on either side, So perfect, so divine that our poor eyes And dazzled with the sweet proportioning, And wonder that 'tis so,âthe magic chance! Her nostrils, small, fragrant, faery-delicate; Her lipsâI swear no human bones e'er wore So taking a disguiseâyou shall behold her! We'll have her presently; aye, you shall see her, And wonder at her, friends, she is so fairâ She is the world's chief Jewel, and by heaven She's mine by right of marriageâshe is mine! Patience, good people, in fit time I send A Summonerâshe will obey my call, Being a wife most mild and dutiful. First I would hear what music is prepared To herald and receive herâlet me hear! Sigifred. Bid the musicians soothe him tenderly. [A soft strain of Music. Ludolph. Ye have none betterânoâI am content; 'Tis a rich sobbing melody, with reliefs Full and majestic; it is well enough, And will be sweeter, when ye see her pace Sweeping into this presence, glisten'd o'er With emptied caskets, and her train upheld By ladies, habited in robes of lawn, Sprinkled with golden crescents; (others bright In silks, with spangles shower'd,) and bow'd to By Duchesses and pearled Margravinesâ Sad, that the fairest creature of the earthâ I pray you mind me notâ'tis sad, I say, That the extremest beauty of the world Should so entrench herself away from me, Behind a barrier of engender'd guilt! Second Lady. Ah! what a moan! First Knight. Most piteous indeed! Ludolph. She shall be brought before this company, And thenâthenâ First Lady. He muses. Gersa. O, Fortune, where will this end? Sigifred. I guess his purpose! Indeed he must not have That pestilence brought in,âthat cannot be, There we must stop him. Gersa. I am lost! Hush, hush! He is about to rave again. Ludolph. A barrier of guilt! I was the fool. She was the cheater! Who's the cheater now, And who the fool? The entrapp'd, the caged fool, The bird-lim'd raven? She shall croak to death Secure! Methinks I have her in my fist, To crush her with my heel! Wait, wait! I marvel My father keeps away: good friend, ah! Sigifred! Do bring him to meâand Erminia I fain would see before I sleepâand Ethelbert, That he may bless me, as I know he will Though I have curs'd him. Sigifred. Rather suffer me To lead you to themâ Ludolph. No, excuse me, noâ The day is not quite doneâgo bring them hither. [Exit Sigifred. Certes, a father's smile should, like sun light, Slant on my sheafed harvest of ripe blissâ Besides, I thirst to pledge my lovely Bride In a deep goblet: let me seeâwhat wine? The strong Iberian juice, or mellow Greek? Or pale Calabrian? Or the Tuscan grape? Or of old Ãtna's pulpy wine presses, Black stain'd with the fat vintage, as it were The purple slaughter-house, where Bacchus' self Prick'd his own swollen veins? Where is my Page? Page. Here, here! Ludolph. Be ready to obey me; anon thou shalt Bear a soft message for meâfor the hour Draws near when I must make a winding up Of bridal Mysteriesâa fine-spun vengeance! Carve it on my Tomb, that when I rest beneath Men shall confessâThis Prince was gull'd and cheated, But from the ashes of disgrace he rose More than a fiery PhÅnixâand did burn His ignominy up in purging firesâ Did I not send, Sir, but a moment past, For my Father? Gersa. You did. Ludolph. Perhaps 'twould be Much better he came not. Gersa. He enters now! Enter Otho, Erminia, Ethelbert, Sigifred, and Physician. Ludolph. O thou good Man, against whose sacred head I was a mad conspirator, chiefly too For the sake of my fair newly wedded wife, Now to be punish'd, do not look so sad! Those charitable eyes will thaw my heart, Those tears will wash away a just resolve, A verdict ten times sworn! Awakeâawakeâ Put on a judge's brow, and use a tongue Made iron-stern by habit! Thou shalt see A deed to be applauded, 'scribed in gold! Join a loud voice to mine, and so denounce What I alone will execute! Otho. Dear son, What is it? By your father's love, I sue That it be nothing merciless! Ludolph. To that demon? Not so! No! She is in temple-stall Being garnish'd for the sacrifice, and I, The Priest of Justice, will immolate her Upon the altar of wrath! She stings me through!â Even as the worm doth feed upon the nut, So she, a scorpion, preys upon my brain! I feel her gnawing here! Let her but vanish, Then, father, I will lead your legions forth, Compact in steeled squares, and speared files, And bid our trumpets speak a fell rebuke To nations drows'd in peace! Otho. To-morrow, Son, Be your word lawâforget to-dayâ Ludolph. I will When I have finish'd itânow! now! I'm pight, Tight-footed for the deed! Erminia. Alas! Alas! Ludolph. What Angel's voice is that? Erminia! Ah! gentlest creature, whose sweet innocence Was almost murder'd; I am penitent, Wilt thou forgive me? And thou, holy Man, Good Ethelbert, shall I die in peace with you? Erminia. Die, my lord! Ludolph. I feel it possible. Otho. Physician? Physician. I fear me he is past my skill. Otho. Not so! Ludolph. I see it, I see itâI have been wanderingâ Half-madânot right hereâI forget my purpose. Bestir, bestir, Auranthe! ha! ha! ha! Youngster! Page! go bid them drag her to me! Obey! This shall finish it! [Draws a dagger. Otho. O my Son! my Son! Sigifred. This must not beâstop there! Ludolph. Am I obey'd? A little talk with herâno harmâhaste! haste! [Exit Page. Set her before meânever fear I can strike. Several Voices. My Lord! My Lord! Gersa. Good Prince! Ludolph. Why do ye trouble me? outâoutâout away! There she is! take that! and that! no, noâ That's not well doneâWhere is she? [The doors open. Enter Page, Several women are seen grouped about Auranthe in the inner room. Page. Alas! My Lord, my Lord! they cannot move her! Her arms are stiff,âher fingers clench'd and coldâ Ludolph. She's dead! [Staggers and falls into their arms. Ethelbert. Take away the dagger. Gersa. Softly; so! Otho. Thank God for that! Sigifred. I fear it could not harm him. Gersa. No!âbrief be his anguish! Ludolph. She's goneâI am contentâNobles, good night! We are all wearyâfaintâset ope the doorsâ I will to bed!âTo-morrowâ [Dies. THE CURTAIN FALLS. KING STEPHEN A FRAGMENT OF A TRAGEDY WRITTEN IN NOVEMBER 1819 ACT I. Scene I. âField of Battle. Alarum. Enter King Stephen, Knights, and Soldiers. Stephen. If shame can on a soldier's vein-swoll'n front Spread deeper crimson than the battle's toil, Blush in your casing helmets! for see, see! Yonder my chivalry, my pride of war, Wrench'd with an iron hand from firm array, Are routed loose about the plashy meads, Of honour forfeit. O that my known voice Could reach your dastard ears, and fright you more! Fly, cowards, fly! Glocester is at your backs! Throw your slack bridles o'er the flurried manes, Ply well the rowel with faint trembling heels, Scampering to death at last! First Knight. The enemy Bears his flaunt standard close upon their rear. Second Knight. Sure of a bloody prey, seeing the fens Will swamp them girth-deep. Stephen. Over head and ears, No matter! 'Tis a gallant enemy; How like a comet he goes streaming on. But we must plague him in the flank,âhey, friends? We are well breathed,âfollow! Enter Earl Baldwin and Soldiers, as defeated. Stephen. De Redvers! What is the monstrous bugbear that can fright Baldwin? Baldwin. No scare-crow, but the fortunate star Of boisterous Chester, whose fell truncheon now Points level to the goal of victory. This way he comes, and if you would maintain Your person unaffronted by vile odds, Take horse, my Lord. Stephen. And which way spur for life? Now I thank Heaven I am in the toils, That soldiers may bear witness how my arm Can burst the meshes. Not the eagle more Loves to beat up against a tyrannous blast, Than I to meet the torrent of my foes. This is a brag,âbe't so,âbut if I fall, Carve it upon my 'scutcheon'd sepulchre. On, fellow soldiers! Earl of Redvers, back! Not twenty Earls of Chester shall brow-beat The diadem. [Exeunt. Alarum. Scene II. âAnother part of the Field. Trumpets sounding a Victory. Enter Glocester, Knights, and Forces. Glocester. Now may we lift our bruised vizors up, And take the flattering freshness of the air, While the wide din of battle dies away Into times past, yet to be echoed sure In the silent pages of our chroniclers. First Knight. Will Stephen's death be mark'd there, my good Lord, Or that we gave him lodging in yon towers? Glocester. Fain would I know the great usurper's fate. Enter two Captains severally. First Captain. My Lord! Second Captain. Most noble Earl! First Captain. The Kingâ Second Captain. The Empress greetsâ Glocester. What of the King? First Captain. He sole and lone maintains A hopeless bustle mid our swarming arms, And with a nimble savageness attacks, Escapes, makes fiercer onset, then anew Eludes death, giving death to most that dare Trespass within the circuit of his sword! He must by this have fallen. Baldwin is taken; And for the Duke of Bretagne, like a stag He flies, for the Welsh beagles to hunt down. God save the Empress! Glocester. Now our dreaded Queen: What message from her Highness? Second Captain. Royal Maud From the throng'd towers of Lincoln hath look'd down, Like Pallas from the walls of Ilion, And seen her enemies havock'd at her feet. She greets most noble Glocester from her heart, Intreating him, his captains, and brave knights, To grace a banquet. The high city gates Are envious which shall see your triumph pass; The streets are full of music. Enter Second Knight. Glocester. Whence come you? Second Knight. From Stephen, my good Prince,âStephen! Stephen! Glocester. Why do you make such echoing of his name? Second Knight. Because I think, my lord, he is no man, But a fierce demon, 'nointed safe from wounds, And misbaptized with a Christian name. Glocester. A mighty soldier!âDoes he still hold out? Second Knight. He shames our victory. His valour still Keeps elbow-room amid our eager swords, And holds our bladed falchions all aloofâ His gleaming battle-axe being slaughter-sick, Smote on the morion of a Flemish knight, Broke short in his hand; upon the which he flung The heft away with such a vengeful force, It paunch'd the Earl of Chester's horse, who then Spleen-hearted came in full career at him. Glocester. Did no one take him at a vantage then? Second Knight. Three then with tiger leap upon him flew, Whom, with his sword swift-drawn and nimbly held, He stung away again, and stood to breathe, Smiling. Anon upon him rush'd once more A throng of foes, and in this renew'd strife, My sword met his and snapp'd off at the hilts. Glocester. Come, lead me to this Marsâand let us move In silence, not insulting his sad doom With clamorous trumpets. To the Empress bear My salutation as befits the time. [Exeunt Glocester and Forces. Scene III. âThe Field of Battle. Enter Stephen unarmed. Stephen. Another sword! And what if I could seize One from Bellona's gleaming armoury, Or choose the fairest of her sheaved spears! Where are my enemies? Here, close at hand, Here come the testy brood. O for a sword! I'm faintâa biting sword! A noble sword! A hedge-stakeâor a ponderous stone to hurl With brawny vengeance, like the labourer Cain. Come on! Farewell my kingdom, and all hail Thou superb, plum'd, and helmeted renown, All hailâI would not truck this brilliant day To rule in Pylos with a Nestor's beardâ Come on! Enter De Kaims and Knights, &amp;c. De Kaims. Is't madness, or a hunger after death, That makes thee thus unarm'd throw taunts at us? Yield, Stephen, or my sword's point dip in The gloomy current of a traitor's heart. Stephen. Do it, De Kaims, I will not budge an inch. De Kaims. Yes, of thy madness thou shalt take the meed. Stephen. Darest thou? De Kaims. How dare, against a man disarm'd? Stephen. What weapons has the lion but himself? Come not near me, De Kaims, for by the price Of all the glory I have won this day, Being a king, I will not yield alive To any but the second man of the realm, Robert of Glocester. De Kaims. Thou shalt vail to me. Stephen Shall I, when I have sworn against it, sir? Thou think'st it brave to take a breathing king, That, on a court-day bow'd to haughty Maud, The awed presence-chamber may be bold To whisper, there's the man who took alive Stephenâmeâprisoner. Certes, De Kaims, The ambition is a noble one. De Kaims. 'Tis true, And, Stephen, I must compass it. Stephen. No, no, Do not tempt me to throttle you on the gorge, Or with my gauntlet crush your hollow breast, Just when your knighthood is grown ripe and full For lordship. A Soldier. Is an honest yeoman's spear Of no use at a need? Take that. Stephen. Ah, dastard! De Kaims. What, you are vulnerable! my prisoner! Stephen. No, not yet. I disclaim it, and demand Death as a sovereign right unto a king Who 'sdains to yield to any but his peer, If not in title, yet in noble deeds, The Earl of Glocester. Stab to the hilts, De Kaims, For I will never by mean hands be led From this so famous field. Do ye hear! Be quick! [Trumpets. Enter the Earl of Chester and Knights. Scene IV. âA Presence Chamber. Queen Maud in a Chair of State, the Earls of Glocester and Chester, Lords, Attendants. Maud. Glocester, no more: I will behold that Boulogne: Set him before me. Not for the poor sake Of regal pomp and a vain-glorious hour, As thou with wary speech, yet near enough, Hast hinted. Glocester. Faithful counsel have I given; If wary, for your Highness' benefit. Maud. The Heavens forbid that I should not think so, For by thy valour have I won this realm, Which by thy wisdom I will ever keep. To sage advisers let me ever bend A meek attentive ear, so that they treat Of the wide kingdom's rule and government, Not trenching on our actions personal. Advis'd, not school'd, I would be; and henceforth Spoken to in clear, plain, and open terms, Not side-ways sermon'd at. Glocester. Then, in plain terms, Once more for the fallen kingâ Maud. Your pardon, Brother, I would no more of that; for, as I said, 'Tis not for worldly pomp I wish to see The rebel, but as dooming judge to give A sentence something worthy of his guilt. Glocester. If't must be so, I'll bring him to your presence. [Exit Glocester. Maud. A meaner summoner might do as wellâ My Lord of Chester, is 't true what I hear Of Stephen of Boulogne, our prisoner, That he, as a fit penance for his crimes, Eats wholesome, sweet, and palatable food Off Glocester's golden dishesâdrinks pure wine, Lodges soft? Chester. More than that, my gracious Queen, Has anger'd me. The noble Earl, methinks, Full soldier as he is, and without peer In counsel, dreams too much among his books. It may read well, but sure 'tis out of date To play the Alexander with Darius. Maud. Truth! I think so. By Heavens it shall not last! Chester. It would amaze your Highness now to mark How Glocester overstrains his courtesy To that crime-loving rebel, that Boulogneâ Maud. That ingrate! Chester. For whose vast ingratitude To our late sovereign lord, your noble sire, The generous Earl condoles in his mishaps, And with a sort of lackeying friendliness, Talks off the mighty frowning from his brow, Woos him to hold a duet in a smile, Or, if it please him, play an hour at chessâ Maud. A perjured slave! Chester. And for his perjury, Glocester has fit rewardsânay, I believe, He sets his bustling household's wits at work For flatteries to ease this Stephen's hours, And make a heaven of his purgatory; Adorning bondage with the pleasant gloss Of feasts and music, and all idle shows Of indoor pageantry; while syren whispers, Predestin'd for his ear, 'scape as half-check'd From lips the courtliest and the rubiest Of all the realm, admiring of his deeds. Maud. A frost upon his summer! Chester. A queen's nod Can make his June December. Here he comes.</field>

[The day is gone, and all its sweets are gone!] The day is gone, and all its sweets are gone! Sweet voice, sweet lips, soft hand, and softer breast, Warm breath, light whisper, tender semi-tone, Bright eyes, accomplish'd shape, and lang'rous waist! Faded the flower and all its budded charms, Faded the sight of beauty from my eyes, Faded the shape of beauty from my arms, Faded the voice, warmth, whiteness, paradiseâ Vanish'd unseasonably at shut of eve, When the dusk holidayâor holinight Of fragrant-curtain'd love begins to weave The woof of darkness thick, for hid delight; But, as I've read love's missal through to-day, He'll let me sleep, seeing I fast and pray. LINES TO FANNY. What can I do to drive away Remembrance from my eyes? for they have seen, Aye, an hour ago, my brilliant Queen! Touch has a memory. O say, love, say, What can I do to kill it and be free In my old liberty? When every fair one that I saw was fair, Enough to catch me in but half a snare, Not keep me there: When, howe'er poor or particolour'd things, My muse had wings, And ever ready was to take her course Whither I bent her force, Unintellectual, yet divine to me;â Divine, I say!âWhat sea-bird o'er the sea Is a philosopher the while he goes Winging along where the great water throes? How shall I do To get anew Those moulted feathers, and so mount once more Above, above The reach of fluttering Love, And make him cower lowly while I soar? Shall I gulp wine? No, that is vulgarism, A heresy and schism, Foisted into the canon law of love;â No,âwine is only sweet to happy men; More dismal cares Seize on me unawares,â Where shall I learn to get my peace again? To banish thoughts of that most hateful land, Dungeoner of my friends, that wicked strand Where they were wreck'd and live a wrecked life; That monstrous region, whose dull rivers pour, Ever from their sordid urns unto the shore, Unown'd of any weedy-haired gods; Whose winds, all zephyrless, hold scourging rods, Iced in the great lakes, to afflict mankind; Whose rank-grown forests, frosted, black, and blind, Would fright a Dryad; whose harsh herbag'd meads Make lean and lank the starv'd ox while he feeds; There bad flowers have no scent, birds no sweet song, And great unerring Nature once seems wrong. O, for some sunny spell To dissipate the shadows of this hell! Say they are gone,âwith the new dawning light Steps forth my lady bright! O, let me once more rest My soul upon that dazzling breast! Let once again these aching arms be plac'd, The tender gaolers of thy waist! And let me feel that warm breath here and there To spread a rapture in my very hair,â O, the sweetness of the pain! Give me those lips again! Enough! Enough! it is enough for me To dream of thee! SONNET. TO FANNY. I cry your mercyâpityâlove!âaye, love!

THE FALL OF HYPERION AN ATTEMPT MADE AT THE END OF 1819 TO RECONSTRUCT THE POEM A DREAM [CANTO I.] Fanatics have their dreams, wherewith they weave A paradise for a sect; the savage too From forth the loftiest fashion of his sleep Guesses at Heaven; pity these have not Trac'd upon vellum or wild Indian leaf The shadows of melodious utterance. But bare of laurel they live, dream, and die; For Poesy alone can tell her dreams, With the fine spell of words alone can save Imagination from the sable chain And dumb enchantment. Who alive can say, âThou art no Poetâmay'st not tell thy dreams?â Since every man whose soul is not a clod Hath visions, and would speak, if he had loved, And been well nurtured in his mother tongue. Whether the dream now purpos'd to rehearse Be poet's or fanatic's will be known When this warm scribe my hand is in the grave. Methought I stood where trees of every clime, Palm, myrtle, oak, and sycamore, and beech, With plantain, and spice-blossoms, made a screen; In neighbourhood of fountains (by the noise Soft-showering in my ears), and, (by the touch Of scent,) not far from roses. Turning round I saw an arbour with a drooping roof Of trellis vines, and bells, and larger blooms, Like floral censers, swinging light in air; Before its wreathed doorway, on a mound Of moss, was spread a feast of summer fruits, Which, nearer seen, seem'd refuse of a meal By angel tasted or our Mother Eve; For empty shells were scattered on the grass, And grape-stalks but half bare, and remnants more, Sweet-smelling, whose pure kinds I could not know. Still was more plenty than the fabled horn Thrice emptied could pour forth, at banqueting For Proserpine return'd to her own fields, Where the white heifers low. And appetite More yearning than on Earth I ever felt Growing within, I ate deliciously; And, after not long, thirsted, for thereby Stood a cool vessel of transparent juice Sipp'd by the wander'd bee, the which I took, And, pledging all the mortals of the world, And all the dead whose names are in our lips, Drank. That full draught is parent of my theme. No Asian poppy nor elixir fine Of the soon-fading jealous Caliphat; No poison gender'd in close monkish cell, To thin the scarlet conclave of old men, Could so have rapt unwilling life away. Among the fragrant husks and berries crush'd, Upon the grass I struggled hard against The domineering potion; but in vain: The cloudy swoon came on, and down I sank, Like a Silenus on an antique vase. How long I slumber'd 'tis a chance to guess. When sense of life return'd, I started up As if with wings; but the fair trees were gone, The mossy mound and arbour were no more: I look'd around upon the carved sides Of an old sanctuary with roof august, Builded so high, it seem'd that filmed clouds Might spread beneath, as o'er the stars of heaven; So old the place was, I remember'd none The like upon the Earth: what I had seen Of grey cathedrals, buttress'd walls, rent towers, The superannuations of sunk realms, Or Nature's rocks toil'd hard in waves and winds, Seem'd but the faulture of decrepit things To that eternal domed Monument.â Upon the marble at my feet there lay Store of strange vessels and large draperies, Which needs had been of dyed asbestos wove, Or in that place the moth could not corrupt, So white the linen, so, in some, distinct Ran imageries from a sombre loom. All in a mingled heap confus'd there lay Robes, golden tongs, censer and chafing-dish, Girdles, and chains, and holy jewelries. Turning from these with awe, once more I rais'd My eyes to fathom the space every way; The embossed roof, the silent massy range Of columns north and south, ending in mist Of nothing, then to eastward, where black gates Were shut against the sunrise evermore.â Then to the west I look'd, and saw far off An image, huge of feature as a cloud, At level of whose feet an altar slept, To be approach'd on either side by steps, And marble balustrade, and patient travail To count with toil the innumerable degrees. Towards the altar sober-paced I went, Repressing haste, as too unholy there; And, coming nearer, saw beside the shrine One minist'ring; and there arose a flame.â When in mid-way the sickening East wind Shifts sudden to the south, the small warm rain Melts out the frozen incense from all flowers, And fills the air with so much pleasant health That even the dying man forgets his shroud;â Even so that lofty sacrificial fire, Sending forth Maian incense, spread around Forgetfulness of everything but bliss, And clouded all the altar with soft smoke; From whose white fragrant curtains thus I heard Language pronounc'd: âIf thou canst not ascend âThese steps, die on that marble where thou art. âThy flesh, near cousin to the common dust, âWill parch for lack of nutrimentâthy bones âWill wither in few years, and vanish so âThat not the quickest eye could find a grain âOf what thou now art on that pavement cold. âThe sands of thy short life are spent this hour, âAnd no hand in the universe can turn âThy hourglass, if these gummed leaves be burnt âEre thou canst mount up these immortal steps.â I heard, I look'd: two senses both at once, So fine, so subtle, felt the tyranny Of that fierce threat and the hard task proposed. Prodigious seem'd the toil; the leaves were yet Burningâwhen suddenly a palsied chill Struck from the paved level up my limbs, And was ascending quick to put cold grasp Upon those streams that pulse beside the throat: I shriek'd, and the sharp anguish of my shriek Stung my own earsâI strove hard to escape The numbness; strove to gain the lowest step. Slow, heavy, deadly was my pace: the cold Grew stifling, suffocating, at the heart; And when I clasp'd my hands I felt them not. One minute before death, my iced foot touch'd The lowest stair; and as it touch'd, life seem'd To pour in at the toes: I mounted up, As once fair angels on a ladder flew From the green turf to HeavenââHoly Power,â Cried I, approaching near the horned shrine, âWhat am I that should so be saved from death? âWhat am I that another death come not âTo choke my utterance sacrilegious, here?â Then said the veiled shadowââThou hast felt âWhat 'tis to die and live again before âThy fated hour, that thou hadst power to do so âIs thy own safety; thou hast dated on Thy doom.âââHigh Prophetess,â said I, âpurge off, Benign, if so it please thee, my mind's film.ââ âNone can usurp this height,â return'd that shade, âBut those to whom the miseries of the world âAre misery, and will not let them rest. âAll else who find a haven in the world, âWhere they may thoughtless sleep away their days, âIf by a chance into this fane they come, âRot on the pavement where thou rottedst half.ââ âAre there not thousands in the world,â said I, Encourag'd by the sooth voice of the shade, âWho love their fellows even to the death, âWho feel the giant agony of the world, âAnd more, like slaves to poor humanity, âLabour for mortal good? I sure should see âOther men here; but I am here alone.â âThose whom thou spak'st of are no vision'ries,â Rejoin'd that voiceââThey are no dreamers weak, âThey seek no wonder but the human face; âNo music but a happy-noted voiceâ âThey come not here, they have no thought to comeâ âAnd thou art here, for thou art less than theyâ âWhat benefit canst thou, or all thy tribe, âTo the great world? Thou art a dreaming thing, âA fever of thyselfâthink of the Earth; âWhat bliss even in hope is there for thee? âWhat haven? every creature hath its home; âEvery sole man hath days of joy and pain, âWhether his labours be sublime or lowâ âThe pain alone; the joy alone; distinct: âOnly the dreamer venoms all his days, âBearing more woe than all his sins deserve. âTherefore, that happiness be somewhat shar'd, âSuch things as thou art are admitted oft âInto like gardens thou didst pass erewhile, âAnd suffer'd in these temples: for that cause âThou standest safe beneath this statue's knees.â âThat I am favour'd for unworthiness, âBy such propitious parley medicin'd âIn sickness not ignoble, I rejoice, âAye, and could weep for love of such award.â So answer'd I, continuing, âIf it please, âMajestic shadow, tell me: sure not all âThose melodies sung into the World's ear âAre useless: sure a poet is a sage; âA humanist, physician to all men. âThat I am none I feel, as vultures feel âThey are no birds when eagles are abroad. âWhat am I then: Thou spakest of my tribe: âWhat tribe?â The tall shade veil'd in drooping white Then spake, so much more earnest, that the breath Moved the thin linen folds that drooping hung About a golden censer from the hand PendentââArt thou not of the dreamer tribe? âThe poet and the dreamer are distinct, âDiverse, sheer opposite, antipodes. âThe one pours out a balm upon the World, âThe other vexes it.â Then shouted I Spite of myself, and with a Pythia's spleen âApollo! faded! O far flown Apollo! âWhere is thy misty pestilence to creep âInto the dwellings, through the door crannies âOf all mock lyrists, large self worshipers âAnd careless Hectorers in proud bad verse. âThough I breathe death with them it wil be life âTo see them sprawl before me into graves. âMajestic shadow, tell me where I am, âWhose altar this; for whom this incense curls; âWhat image this whose face I cannot see, âFor the broad marble knees; and who thou art, âOf accent feminine so courteous?â Then the tall shade, in drooping linens veil'd, Spoke out, so much more earnest, that her breath Stirr'd the thin folds of gauze that drooping hung About a golden censer from her hand Pendent; and by her voice I knew she shed Long-treasured tears. âThis temple, sad and lone, âIs all spar'd from the thunder of a war âFoughten long since by giant hierarchy âAgainst rebellion: this old image here, âWhose carved features wrinkled as he fell, âIs Saturn's; I Moneta, left supreme âSole Priestess of this desolation.ââ I had no words to answer, for my tongue, Useless, could find about its roofed home No syllable of a fit majesty To make rejoinder to Moneta's mourn. There was a silence, while the altar's blaze Was fainting for sweet food: I look'd thereon, And on the paved floor, where nigh were piled Faggots of cinnamon, and many heaps Of other crisped spice-woodâthen again I look'd upon the altar, and its horns Whiten'd with ashes, and its lang'rous flame, And then upon the offerings again; And so by turnsâtill sad Moneta cried, âThe sacrifice is done, but not the less âWill I be kind to thee for thy good will. âMy power, which to me is still a curse, âShall be to thee a wonder; for the scenes âStill swooning vivid through my globed brain, âWith an electral changing misery, âThou shalt with these dull mortal eyes behold, âFree from all pain, if wonder pain thee not.â As near as an immortal's sphered words Could to a mother's soften, were these last: And yet I had a terror of her robes, And chiefly of the veils, that from her brow Hung pale, and curtain'd her in mysteries, That made my heart too small to hold its blood. This saw that Goddess, and with sacred hand Parted the veils. Then saw I a wan face, Not pin'd by human sorrows, but bright-blanch'd By an immortal sickness which kills not; It works a constant change, which happy death Can put no end to; deathwards progressing To no death was that visage; it had past The lilly and the snow; and beyond these I must not think now, though I saw that faceâ But for her eyes I should have fled away. They held me back, with a benignant light, Soft mitigated by divinest lids Half-closed, and visionless entire they seem'd Of all external things;âthey saw me not, But in blank splendor, beam'd like the mild moon, Who comforts those she sees not, who knows not What eyes are upward cast. As I had found A grain of gold upon a mountain's side, And twing'd with avarice strain'd out my eyes To search its sullen entrails rich with ore, So at the view of sad Moneta's brow, I ask'd to see what things the hollow brain Behind environed: what high tragedy In the dark secret chambers of her skull Was acting, that could give so dread a stress To her cold lips, and fill with such a light Her planetary eyes; and touch her voice With such a sorrowââShade of Memory!ââ Cried I, with act adorant at her feet, âBy all the gloom hung round thy fallen house, âBy this last temple, by the golden age, âBy great Apollo, thy dear Foster Child, âAnd by thyself, forlorn divinity, âThe pale Omega of a withered race, âLet me behold, according as thou saidst, âWhat in thy brain so ferments to and fro!â No sooner had this conjuration pass'd My devout lips, than side by side we stood (Like a stunt bramble by a solemn pine) Deep in the shady sadness of a vale, Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn, Far from the fiery noon and eve's one star. Onward I look'd beneath the gloomy boughs, And saw, what first I thought an image huge, Like to the image pedestal'd so high In Saturn's temple. Then Moneta's voice Came brief upon mine earââSo Saturn sat When he had lost his Realmsââ whereon there grew A power within me of enormous ken To see as a god sees, and take the depth Of things as nimbly as the outward eye Can size and shape pervade. The lofty theme At those few words hung vast before my mind, With half-unravel'd web. I set myself Upon an eagle's watch, that I might see, And seeing ne'er forget. No stir of life Was in this shrouded vale, not so much air As in the zoning of a summer's day Robs not one light seed from the feather'd grass, But where the dead leaf fell there did it rest: A stream went voiceless by, still deaden'd more By reason of the fallen divinity Spreading more shade; the Naiad 'mid her reeds Prest her cold finger closer to her lips. Along the margin-sand large footmarks went No farther than to where old Saturn's feet Had rested, and there slept, how long a sleep! Degraded, cold, upon the sodden ground His old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead, Unsceptred; and his realmless eyes were clos'd, While his bow'd head seem'd listening to the Earth, His ancient mother, for some comfort yet. It seem'd no force could wake him from his place; But there came one who, with a kindred hand Touch'd his wide shoulders after bending low With reverence, though to one who knew it not. Then came the griev'd voice of Mnemosyne, And griev'd I hearken'd. âThat divinity âWhom thou saw'st step from yon forlornest wood, âAnd with slow pace approach our fallen King, âIs Thea, softest-natur'd of our Brood.â I mark'd the Goddess in fair statuary Surpassing wan Moneta by the head, And in her sorrow nearer woman's tears. There was a listening fear in her regard, As if calamity had but begun; As if the vanward clouds of evil days Had spent their malice, and the sullen rear Was with its stored thunder labouring up. One hand she press'd upon that aching spot Where beats the human heart, as if just there, Though an immortal, she felt cruel pain; The other upon Saturn's bended neck She laid, and to the level of his hollow ear Leaning with parted lips, some words she spake In solemn tenor and deep organ tune; Some mourning words, which in our feeble tongue Would come in this-like accenting; how frail To that large utterance of the early Gods! âSaturn! look upâand for what, poor lost King? âI have no comfort for thee; no not one; âI cannot say, wherefore thus sleepest thou? âFor Heaven is parted from thee, and the Earth âKnows thee not, so afflicted, for a God; âAnd Ocean too, with all its solemn noise, âHas from thy sceptre pass'd, and all the air âIs emptied of thine hoary majesty: âThy thunder, captious at the new command, âRumbles reluctant o'er our fallen house; âAnd thy sharp lightning, in unpracticed hands, âScorches and burns our once serene domain. âWith such remorseless speed still come new woes, âThat unbelief has not a space to breathe. âSaturn! sleep on:âMe thoughtless, why should I âThus violate thy slumbrous solitude? âWhy should I ope thy melancholy eyes? âSaturn, sleep on, while at thy feet I weep.â As when upon a tranced summer-night Forests, branch-charmed by the earnest stars, Dream, and so dream all night without a noise, Save from one gradual solitary gust, Swelling upon the silence; dying off; As if the ebbing air had but one wave; So came these words, and went; the while in tears She prest her fair large forehead to the earth, Just where her fallen hair might spread in curls, A soft and silken mat for Saturn's feet. Long, long these two were postured motionless, Like sculpture builded-up upon the grave Of their own power. A long awful time I look'd upon them: still they were the same; The frozen God still bending to the earth, And the sad Goddess weeping at his feet, Moneta silent. Without stay or prop, But my own weak mortality, I bore The load of this eternal quietude, The unchanging gloom, and the three fixed shapes Ponderous upon my senses, a whole moon. For by my burning brain I measured sure Her silver seasons shedded on the night, And every day by day methought I grew More gaunt and ghostly.âOftentimes I pray'd Intense, that Death would take me from the Vale And all its burthensâgasping with despair Of change, hour after hour I curs'd myself; Until old Saturn rais'd his faded eyes, And look'd around and saw his kingdom gone, And all the gloom and sorrow of the place, And that fair kneeling Goddess at his feet. As the moist scent of flowers, and grass, and leaves, Fills forest dells with a pervading air, Known to the woodland nostril, so the words Of Saturn fill'd the mossy glooms around, Even to the hollows of time-eaten oaks, And to the windings of the foxes' hole, With sad low tones, while thus he spake, and sent Strange musings to the solitary Pan. âMoan, brethren, moan; for we are swallow'd up âAnd buried from all Godlike exercise âOf influence benign on planets pale, âAnd peaceful sway above man's harvesting, âAnd all those acts which Deity supreme âDoth ease its heart of love in. Moan and wail, âMoan, brethren, moan; for lo, the rebel spheres âSpin round, the stars their ancient courses keep, âClouds still with shadowy moisture haunt the earth, âStill suck their fill of light from sun and moon; âStill buds the tree, and still the sea-shores murmur; âThere is no death in all the Universe, âNo smell of deathâthere shall be deathâMoan, moan, âMoan, Cybele, moan; for thy pernicious Babes âHave changed a god into an aching Palsy. âMoan, brethren, moan, for I have no strength left, âWeak as the reedâweakâfeeble as my voiceâ âO, O, the pain, the pain of feebleness. âMoan, moan, for still I thawâor give me help; âThrow down those imps, and give me victory. âLet me hear other groans, and trumpets blown âOf triumph calm, and hymns of festival, âFrom the gold peaks of Heaven's high-piled clouds; âVoices of soft proclaim, and silver stir âOf strings in hollow shells; and there shall be âBeautiful things made new for the surprise âOf the sky-children.â So he feebly ceas'd, With such a poor and sickly sounding pause, Methought I heard some old man of the earth Bewailing earthly loss; nor could my eyes And ears act with that pleasant unison of sense Which marries sweet sound with the grace of form, And dolorous accent from a tragic harp With large-limb'd visions.âMore I scrutinized: Still fix'd he sat beneath the sable trees, Whose arms spread straggling in wild serpent forms, With leaves all hush'd; his awful presence there (Now all was silent) gave a deadly lie To what I erewhile heardâonly his lips Trembled amid the white curls of his beard. They told the truth, though, round, the snowy locks Hung nobly, as upon the face of heaven A mid-day fleece of clouds. Thea arose, And stretched her white arm through the hollow dark, Pointing some whither: whereat he too rose Like a vast giant, seen by men at sea To grow pale from the waves at dull midnight. They melted from my sight into the woods; Ere I could turn, Moneta cried, âThese twain âAre speeding to the families of grief, âWhere roof'd in by black rocks they waste, in pain âAnd darkness, for no hope.ââAnd she spake on, As ye may read who can unwearied pass Onward from th'Antichamber of this dream, Where even at the open doors awhile I must delay, and glean my memory Of her high phrase:âperhaps no further dare. END OF CANTO I. CANTO II. âMortal, that thou may'st understand aright, âI humanize my sayings to thine ear, âMaking comparisons of earthly things; âOr thou might'st better listen to the wind, âWhose language is to thee a barren noise, âThough it blows legend-laden thro' the trees.â âIn melancholy realms big tears are shed, âMore sorrow like to this, and such like woe, âToo huge for mortal tongue, or pen of scribe. âThe Titans fierce, self hid or prison bound, âGroan for the old allegiance once more, âListening in their doom for Saturn's voice. âBut one of our whole eagle-brood still keeps âHis sov'reignty, and rule, and majesty; âBlazing Hyperion on his orbed fire âStill sits, still snuffs the incense teeming up âFrom Man to the Sun's God: yet unsecure. âFor as upon the earth dire prodigies âFright and perplex, so also shudders he: âNor at dog's howl or gloom-bird's Even screech, âOr the familiar visitings of one âUpon the first toll of his passing bell: âBut horrors, portioned to a giant nerve, âMake great Hyperion ache. His palace bright, âBastion'd with pyramids of glowing gold, âAnd touch'd with shade of bronzed obelisks, âGlares a blood-red thro' all the thousand courts, âArches, and domes, and fiery galleries: âAnd all its curtains of Aurorian clouds âFlush angerly; when he would taste the wreaths âOf incense breathed aloft from sacred hills, âInstead of sweets, his ample palate takes âSavour of poisonous brass and metals sick. âWherefore when harbour'd in the sleepy West, âAfter the full completion of fair day, âFor rest divine upon exalted couch âAnd slumber in the arms of melody, âHe paces through the pleasant hours of ease, âWith strides colossal, on from hall to hall; âWhile far within each aisle and deep recess âHis winged minions in close clusters stand âAmaz'd, and full of fear; like anxious men, âWho on a wide plain gather in sad troops, âWhen earthquakes jar their battlements and towers. âEven now, while Saturn, roused from icy trance, âGoes, step for step, with Thea from yon woods, âHyperion, leaving twilight in the rear, âIs sloping to the threshold of the West.â âThither we tend.ââNow in clear light I stood, Reliev'd from the dusk vale. Mnemosyne Was sitting on a square-edg'd polish'd stone, That in its lucid depth reflected pure Her priestess-garments.âMy quick eyes ran on From stately nave to nave, from vault to vault, Through bow'rs of fragrant and enwreathed light And diamond-paved lustrous long arcades. Anon rush'd by the bright Hyperion; His flaming robes stream'd out beyond his heels, And gave a roar, as if of earthly fire, That scared away the meek ethereal hours, And made their dove-wings tremble. On he flared. THE CAP AND BELLS OR THE JEALOUSIES A FAERY TALEâUNFINISHED I In midmost Ind, beside Hydaspes cool, There stood, or hover'd, tremulous in the air, A faery city, 'neath the potent rule Of Emperor Elfinan; fam'd ev'rywhere For love of mortal women, maidens fair, Whose lips were solid, whose soft hands were made Of a fit mould and beauty, ripe and rare, To pamper his slight wooing, warm yet staid: He lov'd girls smooth as shades, but hated a mere shade. II This was a crime forbidden by the law; And all the priesthood of his city wept, For ruin and dismay they well foresaw, If impious prince no bound or limit kept, And faery Zendervester overstept; They wept, he sin'd, and still he would sin on, They dreamt of sin, and he sin'd while they slept; In vain the pulpit thunder'd at the throne, Caricature was vain, and vain the tart lampoon. III Which seeing, his high court of parliament Laid a remonstrance at his Highness' feet, Praying his royal senses to content Themselves with what in faery land was sweet, Befitting best that shade with shade should meet: Whereat, to calm their fears, he promis'd soon From mortal tempters all to make retreat,â Aye, even on the first of the new moon, An immaterial wife to espouse as heaven's boon. IV Meantime he sent a fluttering embassy To Pigmio, of Imaus sovereign, To half beg, and half demand, respectfully, The hand of his fair daughter Bellanaine; An audience had, and speeching done, they gain Their point, and bring the weeping bride away; Whom, with but one attendant, safely lain Upon their wings, they bore in bright array, While little harps were touch'd by many a lyric fay. V As in old pictures tender cherubim A child's soul thro' the sapphir'd canvas bear, So, thro' a real heaven, on they swim With the sweet princess on her plumag'd lair, Speed giving to the winds her lustrous hair; And so she journey'd, sleeping or awake, Save when, for healthful exercise and air, She chose to promener Ã  l'aile, or take A pigeon's somerset, for sport or change's sake. VI âDear Princess, do not whisper me so loud,â Quoth Corallina, nurse and confidant, âDo not you see there, lurking in a cloud, Close at your back, that sly old Crafticant? He hears a whisper plainer than a rant: Dry up your tears, and do not look so blue; He's Elfinan's great state-spy militant, His running, lying, flying foot-man too,â Dear mistress, let him have no handle against you! VII âShow him a mouse's tail, and he will guess, With metaphysic swiftness, at the mouse; Show him a garden, and with speed no less, He'll surmise sagely of a dwelling house, And plot, in the same minute, how to chouse The owner out of it; show him aâââPeace! Peace! nor contrive thy mistress' ire to rouse!â Return'd the Princess, âmy tongue shall not cease Till from this hated match I get a free release. VIII âAh, beauteous mortal!â âHush!â quoth Coralline, âReally you must not talk of him, indeed.â âYou hush!â replied the mistress, with a shine Of anger in her eyes, enough to breed In stouter hearts than nurse's fear and dread: 'Twas not the glance itself made nursey flinch, But of its threat she took the utmost heed; Not liking in her heart an hour-long pinch, Or a sharp needle run into her back an inch. IX So she was silenc'd, and fair Bellanaine, Writhing her little body with ennui, Continued to lament and to complain, That Fate, cross-purposing, should let her be Ravish'd away far from her dear countree; That all her feelings should be set at naught, In trumping up this match so hastily, With lowland blood; and lowland blood she thought Poison, as every staunch true-born Imaian ought. X Sorely she griev'd, and wetted three or four White Provence rose-leaves with her faery tears, But not for this cause;âalas! she had more Bad reasons for her sorrow, as appears In the fam'd memoirs of a thousand years, Written by Crafticant, and published By Parpaglion and Co., (those sly compeers Who rak'd up ev'ry fact against the dead,) In Scarab Street, Panthea, at the Jubal's Head. XI Where, after a long hypercritic howl Against the vicious manners of the age He goes on to expose, with heart and soul, What vice in this or that year was the rage, Backbiting all the world in every page; With special strictures on the horrid crime, (Section'd and subsection'd with learning sage,) Of faeries stooping on their wings sublime To kiss a mortal's lips, when such were in their prime. XII Turn to the copious index, you will find Somewhere in the column, headed letter B, The name of Bellanaine, if you're not blind; Then pray refer to the text, and you will see An article made up of calumny Against this highland princess, rating her For giving way, so over fashionably, To this new-fangled vice, which seems a burr Stuck in his moral throat, no coughing e'er could stir. XIII There he says plainly that she lov'd a man! That she around him flutter'd, flirted, toy'd, Before her marriage with great Elfinan; That after marriage too, she never joy'd In husband's company, but still employ'd Her wits to 'scape away to Angle-land; Where liv'd the youth, who worried and annoy'd Her tender heart, and its warm ardours fann'd To such a dreadful blaze, her side would scorch her hand. XIV But let us leave this idle tittle-tattle To waiting-maids, and bed-room coteries, Nor till fit time against her fame wage battle. Poor Elfinan is very ill at ease, Let us resume his subject if you please: For it may comfort and console him much To rhyme and syllable his miseries; Poor Elfinan! whose cruel fate was such, He sat and curs'd a bride he knew he could not touch. XV Soon as (according to his promises) The bridal embassy had taken wing, And vanish'd, bird-like, o'er the suburb trees, The Emperor, empierc'd with the sharp sting Of love, retired, vex'd and murmuring Like any drone shut from the fair bee-queen, Into his cabinet, and there did fling His limbs upon a sofa, full of spleen, And damn'd his House of Commons, in complete chagrin. XVI âI'll trounce some of the members,â cried the Prince, âI'll put a mark against some rebel names, I'll make the Opposition-benches wince, I'll show them very soon, to all their shames, What 'tis to smother up a Prince's flames; That ministers should join in it, I own, Surprises me!âthey too at these high games! Am I an Emperor? Do I wear a crown? Imperial Elfinan, go hang thyself or drown! XVII âI'll trounce 'em!âthere's the square-cut chancellor, His son shall never touch that bishopric; And for the nephew of old Palfior, I'll show him that his speech has made me sick, And give the colonelcy to Phalaric; The tiptoe marquis, moral and gallant, Shall lodge in shabby taverns upon tick; And for the Speaker's second cousin's aunt, She sha'n't be maid of honour,âby heaven that she sha'n't! XVIII âI'll shirk the Duke of A.; I'll cut his brother; I'll give no garter to his eldest son; I won't speak to his sister or his mother! The Viscount B. shall live at cut-and-run; But how in the world can I contrive to stun That fellow's voice, which plagues me worse than any That stubborn fool, that impudent state-dun, Who sets down ev'ry sovereign as a zany,â That vulgar commoner, Esquire Biancopany? XIX âMonstrous affair! Pshaw! pah! what ugly minx Will they fetch from Imaus for my bride? Alas! my wearied heart within me sinks, To think that I must be so near allied To a cold dullard fay,âah, woe betide! Ah, fairest of all human loveliness! Sweet Bertha! what crime can it be to glide About the fragrant pleatings of thy dress, Or kiss thine eyes, or count thy locks, tress after tress?â XX So said, one minute's while his eyes remain'd Half lidded, piteous, languid, innocent; But, in a wink, their splendour they regain'd, Sparkling revenge with amorous fury blent. Love thwarted in bad temper oft has vent: He rose, he stampt his foot, he rang the bell, And order'd some death-warrants to be sent For signature:âsomewhere the tempest fell, As many a poor felon does not live to tell. XXI âAt the same time Eban,ââ(this was his page, A fay of colour, slave from top to toe, Sent as a present, while yet under age, From the Viceroy of Zanguebar,âwise, slow, His speech, his only words were âyesâ and âno,â But swift of look, and foot, and wing was he,â) âAt the same time, Eban, this instant go To Hum the soothsayer, whose name I see Among the fresh arrivals in our empery. XXII âBring Hum to me! But stayâhere, take my ring, The pledge of favour, that he not suspect Any foul play, or awkward murdering, Tho' I have bowstrung many of his sect; Throw in a hint, that if he should neglect One hour, the next shall see him in my grasp, And the next after that shall see him neck'd, Or swallow'd by my hunger-starved asp,â And mention ('tis as well) the torture of the wasp.â XXIII These orders given, the Prince, in half a pet, Let o'er the silk his propping elbow slide, Caught up his little legs, and, in a fret, Fell on the sofa on his royal side. The slave retreated backwards, humble-eyed, And with a slave-like silence clos'd the door, And to old Hum thro' street and alley hied; He âknew the city,â as we say, of yore, And for short cuts and turns, was nobody knew more. XXIV It was the time when wholesale houses close Their shutters with a moody sense of wealth, But retail dealers, diligent, let loose The gas (objected to on score of health), Convey'd in little solder'd pipes by stealth, And make it flare in many a brilliant form, That all the powers of darkness it repell'th, Which to the oil-trade doth great scaith and harm, And supersedeth quite the use of the glow-worm. XXV Eban, untempted by the pastry-cooks, (Of pastry he got store within the palace,) With hasty steps, wrapp'd cloak, and solemn looks, Incognito upon his errand sallies, His smelling-bottle ready for the allies; He pass'd the Hurdy-gurdies with disdain, Vowing he'd have them sent aboard the gallies; Just as he made his vow, it 'gan to rain, Therefore he call'd a coach, and bade it drive amain. XXVI âI'll pull the string,â said he, and further said, âPolluted Jarvey! Ah, thou filthy hack! Whose springs of life are all dried up and dead, Whose linsey-woolsey lining hangs all slack, Whose rug is straw, whose wholeness is a crack; And evermore thy steps go clatter-clitter; Whose glass once up can never be got back, Who prov'st, with jolting arguments and bitter, That 'tis of modern use to travel in a litter. XXVII âThou inconvenience! thou hungry crop For all corn! thou snail-creeper to and fro, Who while thou goest ever seem'st to stop, And fiddle-faddle standest while you go; I' the morning, freighted with a weight of woe, Unto some lazar-house thou journeyest, And in the evening tak'st a double row Of dowdies, for some dance or party drest, Besides the goods meanwhile thou movest east and west. XXVIII âBy thy ungallant bearing and sad mien, An inch appears the utmost thou couldst budge; Yet at the slightest nod, or hint, or sign, Round to the curb-stone patient dost thou trudge, School'd in a beckon, learned in a nudge, A dull-eyed Argus watching for a fare; Quiet and plodding, thou dost bear no grudge To whisking Tilburies, or Phaetons rare, Curricles, or Mail-coaches, swift beyond compare.â XXIX Philosophizing thus, he pull'd the check, And bade the Coachman wheel to such a street, Who, turning much his body, more his neck, Louted full low, and hoarsely did him greet: âCertes, Monsieur were best take to his feet, Seeing his servant can no further drive For press of coaches, that to-night here meet Many as bees about a straw-capp'd hive, When first for April honey into faint flowers they dive.â XXX Eban then paid his fare, and tiptoe went To Hum's hotel; and, as he on did pass With head inclin'd, each dusky lineament Show'd in the pearl-pav'd street, as in a glass; His purple vest, that ever peeping was Rich from the fluttering crimson of his cloak, His silvery trowsers, and his silken sash Tied in a burnish'd knot, their semblance took Upon the mirror'd walls, wherever he might look. XXXI He smil'd at self, and, smiling, show'd his teeth, And seeing his white teeth, he smil'd the more; Lifted his eye-brows, spurn'd the path beneath, Show'd teeth again, and smil'd as heretofore, Until he knock'd at the magician's door; Where, till the porter answer'd, might be seen, In the clear panel more he could adore,â His turban wreath'd of gold, and white, and green, Mustachios, ear-ring, nose-ring, and his sabre keen. XXXII âDoes not your master give a rout to-night?â Quoth the dark page. âOh, no!â return'd the Swiss, âNext door but one to us, upon the right, The Magazin des Modes now open is Against the Emperor's wedding;âand, sir, this My master finds a monstrous horrid bore; As he retir'd, an hour ago I wis, With his best beard and brimstone, to explore And cast a quiet figure in his second floor. XXXIII âGad! he's oblig'd to stick to business! For chalk, I hear, stands at a pretty price; And as for aqua vitÃ¦âthere's a mess! The dentes sapientiÃ¦ of mice, Our barber tells me too, are on the rise,â Tinder's a lighter article,ânitre pure Goes off like lightning,âgrains of Paradise At an enormous figure!âstars not sure!â Zodiac will not move without a sly douceur! XXXIV âVenus won't stir a peg without a fee, And master is too partial, entre nous, ToâââHushâhush!â cried Eban, âsure that is he Coming down stairs,âby St. Bartholomew! As backwards as he can,âis't something new? Or is't his custom, in the name of fun?â âHe always comes down backward, with one shoeââ Return'd the porterââoff, and one shoe on, Like, saving shoe for sock or stocking, my man John!â XXXV It was indeed the great Magician, Feeling, with careful toe, for every stair, And retrograding careful as he can, Backwards and downwards from his own two pair: âSalpietro!â exclaim'd Hum, âis the dog there? He's always in my way upon the mat!â âHe's in the kitchen, or the Lord knows where,ââ Replied the Swiss,ââthe nasty, yelping brat!â âDon't beat him!â return'd Hum, and on the floor came pat. XXXVI Then facing right about, he saw the Page, And said: âDon't tell me what you want, Eban; The Emperor is now in a huge rage,â 'Tis nine to one he'll give you the rattan! Let us away!â Away together ran The plain-dress'd sage and spangled blackamoor, Nor rested till they stood to cool, and fan, And breathe themselves at the Emperor's chamber door, When Eban thought he heard a soft imperial snore. XXXVII âI thought you guess'd, foretold, or prophesied, That's Majesty was in a raving fit?â âHe dreams,â said Hum, âor I have ever lied, That he is tearing you, sir, bit by bit.â âHe's not asleep, and you have little wit,â Replied the page: âthat little buzzing noise, Whate'er your palmistry may make of it, Comes from a play-thing of the Emperor's choice, From a Man-Tiger-Organ, prettiest of his toys.â XXXVIII Eban then usher'd in the learned Seer: Elfinan's back was turn'd, but, ne'ertheless, Both, prostrate on the carpet, ear by ear, Crept silently, and waited in distress, Knowing the Emperor's moody bitterness; Eban especially, who on the floor 'gan Tremble and quake to death,âhe feared less A dose of senna-tea or nightmare Gorgon Than the Emperor when he play'd on his Man-Tiger-Organ. XXXIX They kiss'd nine times the carpet's velvet face Of glossy silk, soft, smooth, and meadow-green, Where the close eye in deep rich fur might trace A silver tissue, scantly to be seen, As daisies lurk'd in June-grass, buds in treen; Sudden the music ceased, sudden the hand Of majesty, by dint of passion keen, Doubled into a common fist, went grand, And knock'd down three cut glasses, and his best ink-stand. XL Then turning round, he saw those trembling two: âEban,â said he, âas slaves should taste the fruits Of diligence, I shall remember you To-morrow, or the next day, as time suits, In a finger conversation with my mutes,â Begone!âfor you, Chaldean! here remain! Fear not, quake not, and as good wine recruits A conjurer's spirits, what cup will you drain? Sherry in silver, hock in gold, or glass'd champagne?â XLI âCommander of the Faithful!â answer'd Hum, âIn preference to these, I'll merely taste A thimble-full of old Jamaica rum.â âA simple boon!â said Elfinan; âthou may'st Have Nantz, with which my morning-coffee's lac'd.â âI'll have a glass of Nantz, then,ââsaid the Seer,â âMade racyâ(sure my boldness is misplac'd!)â With the third partâ(yet that is drinking dear!)â Of the least drop of crÃ¨me de citron, crystal clear.â XLII âI pledge you, Hum! and pledge my dearest love, My Bertha!â âBertha! Bertha!â cried the sage, âI know a many Berthas!â âMine's above All Berthas!â sighed the Emperor. âI engage,â Said Hum, âin duty, and in vassalage, To mention all the Berthas in the Earth;â There's Bertha Watson,âand Miss Bertha Page,â This fam'd for languid eyes, and that for mirth,â There's Bertha Blount of York,âand Bertha Knox of Perth.â XLIII âYou seem to knowâââI do know,â answer'd Hum, âYour Majesty's in love with some fine girl Named Bertha; but her surname will not come, Without a little conjuring.â â'Tis Pearl, 'Tis Bertha Pearl that makes my brains so whirl; And she is softer, fairer than her name!â âWhere does she live?â ask'd Hum. âHer fair locks curl So brightly, they put all our fays to shame!â Live?âO! at Canterbury, with her old grand-dame.â XLIV âGood! good!â cried Hum, âI've known her from a child! She is a changeling of my management; She was born at midnight in an Indian wild; Her mother's screams with the striped tiger's blent, While the torch-bearing slaves a halloo sent Into the jungles; and her palanquin, Rested amid the desert's dreariment, Shook with her agony, till fair were seen The little Bertha's eyes oped on the stars serene.â XLV âI can't say,â said the monarch; âthat may be Just as it happen'd, true or else a bam! Drink up your brandy, and sit down by me, Feel, feel my pulse, how much in love I am; And if your science is not all a sham, Tell me some means to get the lady here.â âUpon my honour!â said the son of Cham, âShe is my dainty changeling, near and dear, Although her story sounds at first a little queer.â XLVI âConvey her to me, Hum, or by my crown, My sceptre, and my cross-surmounted globe, I'll knock youâââDoes your majesty meanâdown? No, no, you never could my feelings probe To such a depth!â The Emperor took his robe, And wept upon its purple palatine, While Hum continued, shamming half a sob,â âIn Canterbury doth your lady shine? But let me cool your brandy with a little wine.â XLVII Whereat a narrow Flemish glass he took, That once belong'd to Admiral de Witt, Admir'd it with a connoisseuring look, And with the ripest claret crowned it, And, ere one lively bead could burst and flit, He turn'd it quickly, nimbly upside down, His mouth being held conveniently fit To catch the treasure: âBest in all the town!â He said, smack'd his moist lips, and gave a pleasant frown. XLVIII âAh! good my Prince, weep not!â And then again He fill'd a bumper. âGreat Sire, do not weep! Your pulse is shocking, but I'll ease your pain.â âFetch me that Ottoman, and prithee keep Your voice low,â said the Emperor; âand steep Some lady's-fingers nice in Candy wine; And prithee, Hum, behind the screen do peep For the rose-water vase, magician mine! And sponge my forehead,âso my love doth make me pine. XLIX âAh, cursed Bellanaine!â âDon't think of her,â Rejoin'd the Mago, âbut on Bertha muse; For, by my choicest best barometer, You shall not throttled be in marriage noose; I've said it, Sire; you only have to choose Bertha or Bellanaine.â So saying, he drew From the left pocket of his threadbare hose, A sampler hoarded slyly, good as new, Holding it by his thumb and finger full in view. L âSire, this is Bertha Pearl's neat handy-work, Her name, see here, Midsummer, ninety-one.â Elfinan snatch'd it with a sudden jerk, And wept as if he never would have done, Honouring with royal tears the poor homespun; Whereon were broider'd tigers with black eyes, And long-tail'd pheasants, and a rising sun, Plenty of posies, great stags, butterflies Bigger than stags,âa moon,âwith other mysteries. LI The monarch handled o'er and o'er again These day-school hieroglyphics with a sigh; Somewhat in sadness, but pleas'd in the main, Till this oracular couplet met his eye AstoundedâCupid I, do thee defy! It was too much. He shrunk back in his chair, Grew pale as death, and faintedâvery nigh! âPho! nonsense!â exclaim'd Hum, ânow don't despair; She does not mean it really. Cheer up hearty there! LII âAnd listen to my words. You say you won't, On any terms, marry Miss Bellanaine; It goes against your conscienceâgood! Well, don't. You say you love a mortal. I would fain Persuade your honour's highness to refrain From peccadilloes. But, Sire, as I say, What good would that do? And, to be more plain, You would do me a mischief some odd day, Cut off my ears and hands, or head too, by my fay! LIII âBesides, manners forbid that I should pass any Vile strictures on the conduct of a prince Who should indulge his genius, if he has any, Not, like a subject, foolish matters mince. Now I think on't, perhaps I could convince Your Majesty there is no crime at all In loving pretty little Bertha, since She's very delicate,ânot over tall,â A fairy's hand, and in the waist, whyâvery small.â LIV âRing the repeater, gentle Hum!â â'Tis five,â Said gentle Hum; âthe nights draw in apace; The little birds I hear are all alive; I see the dawning touch'd upon your face; Shall I put out the candles, please your Grace?â âDo put them out, and, without more ado, Tell me how I may that sweet girl embrace,â How you can bring her to me.â âThat's for you, Great Emperor! to adventure, like a lover true.â LV âI fetch her!âââYes, an 't like your Majesty; And as she would be frighten'd wide awake To travel such a distance through the sky, Use of some soft manÅuvre you must make, For your convenience, and her dear nerves' sake; Nice way would be to bring her in a swoon, Anon, I'll tell what course were best to take; You must away this morning.â âHum! so soon?â âSire, you must be in Kent by twelve o'clock at noon.â LVI At this great CÃ¦sar started on his feet, Lifted his wings, and stood attentive-wise. âThose wings to Canterbury you must beat, If you hold Bertha as a worthy prize. Look in the AlmanackâMoore never liesâ April the twenty-fourth,âthis coming day, Now breathing its new bloom upon the skies, Will end in St. Mark's Eve;âyou must away, For on that eve alone can you the maid convey.â LVII Then the magician solemnly 'gan frown, So that his frost-white eyebrows, beetling low, Shaded his deep-green eyes, and wrinkles brown Plaited upon his furnace-scorched brow: Forth from the hood that hung his neck below, He lifted a bright casket of pure gold, Touch'd a spring-lock, and there in wool, or snow Charm'd into ever-freezing, lay an old And legend-leaved book, mysterious to behold. LVIII âTake this same book,âit will not bite you, Sire; There, put it underneath your royal arm; Though it's a pretty weight it will not tire, But rather on your journey keep you warm: This is the magic, this the potent charm, That shall drive Bertha to a fainting fit! When the time comes, don't feel the least alarm, Uplift her from the ground, and swiftly flit Back to your palace, where I wait for guerdon fit.â LIX âWhat shall I do with this same book?â âWhy merely Lay it on Bertha's table, close beside Her work-box, and 'twill help your purpose dearly; I say no more.â âOr good or ill betide, Through the wide air to Kent this morn I glide!â Exclaim'd the Emperor. âWhen I return, Ask what you will,âI'll give you my new bride! And take some more wine, Hum;âO Heavens! I burn To be upon the wing! Now, now, that minx I spurn!â LX âLeave her to me,â rejoin'd the magian: âBut how shall I account, illustrious fay! For thine imperial absence? Pho! I can Say you are very sick, and bar the way To your so loving courtiers for one day; If either of their two archbishops' graces Should talk of extreme unction, I shall say You do not like cold pig with Latin phrases, Which never should be used but in alarming cases.â LXI âOpen the window, Hum; I'm ready now!â âZooks!â exclaim'd Hum, as up the sash he drew, âBehold, your Majesty, upon the brow Of yonder hill, what crowds of people!â âWhew! The monster's always after something new,â Return'd his Highness, âthey are piping hot To see my pigsny Bellanaine. Hum! do Tighten my belt a little,âso, so,ânot Too tight,âthe book!âmy wand!âso, nothing is forgot.â LXII âWounds! how they shout!â said Hum, âand there,âsee, see! The Ambassadors return'd from Pigmio! The morning's very fine,âuncommonly! See, past the skirts of yon white cloud they go, Tinging it with soft crimsons! Now below The sable-pointed heads of firs and pines They dip, move on, and with them moves a glow Along the forest side! Now amber lines Reach the hill top, and now throughout the valley shines.â LXIII âWhy, Hum, you're getting quite poetical! Those nows you managed in a special style.â âIf ever you have leisure, Sire, you shall See scraps of mine will make it worth your while, Tit-bits for PhÅbus!âyes, you well may smile. Hark! Hah! the bells!â âA little further yet, Good Hum, and let me view this mighty coil.â Then the great Emperor full graceful set His elbow for a prop, and snuff'd his mignonnette. LXIV The morn is full of holiday; loud bells With rival clamours ring from every spire; Cunningly-station'd music dies and swells In echoing places; when the winds respire, Light flags stream out like gauzy tongues of fire; A metropolitan murmur, lifeful, warm, Comes from the northern suburbs; rich attire Freckles with red and gold the moving swarm; While here and there clear trumpets blow a keen alarm. LXV And now the fairy escort was seen clear, Like the old pageant of Aurora's train, Above a pearl-built minster, hovering near; First wily Crafticant, the chamberlain, Balanc'd upon his grey-grown pinions twain, His slender wand officially reveal'd; Then black gnomes scattering sixpences like rain; Then pages three and three; and next, slave-held, The Imaian 'scutcheon bright,âone mouse in argent field. LXVI Gentlemen pensioners next; and after them, A troop of winged Janizaries flew; Then Slaves, as presents bearing many a gem; Then twelve physicians fluttering two and two; And next a chaplain in a cassock new; Then Lords in waiting; then (what head not reels For pleasure?)âthe fair Princess in full view, Borne upon wings,âand very pleas'd she feels To have such splendour dance attendance at her heels. LXVII For there was more magnificence behind: She wav'd her handkerchief. âAh, very grand!â Cried Elfinan, and clos'd the window-blind; âAnd, Hum, we must not shilly-shally stand,â Adieu! adieu! I'm off for Angle-land! I say, old Hocus, have you such a thing About you,âfeel your pockets, I command,â I want, this instant, an invisible ring,â Thank you, old mummy!ânow securely I take wing.â LXVIII Then Elfinan swift vaulted from the floor, And lighted graceful on the window-sill; Under one arm the magic book he bore, The other he could wave about at will; Pale was his face, he still look'd very ill: He bow'd at Bellanaine, and saidââPoor Bell! Farewell! farewell! and if for ever! still For ever fare thee well!ââand then he fell A laughing!âsnapp'd his fingers!âshame it is to tell! LXIX âBy'r Lady! he is gone!â cries Hum, âand Iâ (I own it)âhave made too free with his wine; Old Crafticant will smoke me. By the byeâ This room is full of jewels as a mine,â Dear valuable creatures, how ye shine! Sometime to-day I must contrive a minute, If Mercury propitiously incline, To examine his scrutoire, and see what's in it, For of superfluous diamonds I as well may thin it. LXX âThe Emperor's horrid bad; yes, that's my cue!â Some histories say that this was Hum's last speech; That, being fuddled, he went reeling through The corridor, and scarce upright could reach The stair-head; that being glutted as a leech, And us'd, as we ourselves have just now said, To manage stairs reversely, like a peach Too ripe, he fell, being puzzled in his head With liquor and the staircase: verdictâfound stone dead. LXXI This as a falsehood Crafticanto treats; And as his style is of strange elegance, Gentle and tender, full of soft conceits, (Much like our Boswell's,) we will take a glance At his sweet prose, and, if we can, make dance His woven periods into careless rhyme; O, little faery Pegasus! rearâpranceâ Trot round the quartoâordinary time! March, little Pegasus, with pawing hoof sublime! LXXII Well, let us see,âtenth book and chapter nine,â Thus Crafticant pursues his diary:â â'Twas twelve o'clock at night, the weather fine, Latitude thirty-six; our scouts descry A flight of starlings making rapidly Towards Thibet. Mem.:âbirds fly in the night; From twelve to half-pastâwings not fit to fly For a thick fogâthe Princess sulky quite Call'd for an extra shawl, and gave her nurse a bite. LXXIII âFive minutes before oneâbrought down a moth With my new double-barrelâstew'd the thighs And made a very tolerable brothâ Princess turn'd dainty;âto our great surprise, Alter'd her mind, and thought it very nice: Seeing her pleasant, tried her with a pun, She frown'd; a monstrous owl across us flies About this time,âa sad old figure of fun; Bad omenâthis new match can't be a happy one. LXXIV âFrom two till half-past, dusky way we made, Above the plains of Gobi,âdesert, bleak; Beheld afar off, in the hooded shade Of darkness, a great mountain (strange to speak), Spitting, from forth its sulphur-baken peak, A fan-shap'd burst of blood-red, arrowy fire, Turban'd with smoke, which still away did reek, Solid and black from that eternal pyre, Upon the laden wind that scantly could respire. LXXV âJust upon three o'clock a falling star Created an alarm among our troop, Kill'd a man-cook, a page, and broke a jar, A tureen, and three dishes, at one swoop, Then passing by the Princess, singed her hoop: Could not conceive what Coralline was at, She clapp'd her hands three times and cried out âWhoop!â Some strange Imaian custom. A large bat Came sudden 'fore my face, and brush'd against my hat. LXXVI âFive minutes thirteen seconds after three, Far in the west a mighty fire broke out, Conjectur'd, on the instant, it might be The city of Balkâ'twas Balk beyond all doubt: A Griffin, wheeling here and there about, Kept reconnoitring usâdoubled our guardâ Lighted our torches, and kept up a shout, Till he sheer'd offâthe Princess very scar'dâ And many on their marrow-bones for death prepar'd. LXXVII âAt half-past three arose the cheerful moonâ Bivouack'd for four minutes on a cloudâ Where from the earth we heard a lively tune Of tambourines and pipes, serene and loud, While on a flowery lawn a brilliant crowd Cinque-parted danc'd, some half asleep reposed Beneath the green-fan'd cedars, some did shroud In silken tents, and 'mid light fragrance dozed, Or on the open turf their soothed eyelids closed. LXXVIII âDropp'd my gold watch, and kill'd a kettledrumâ It went for apoplexyâfoolish folks!â Left it to pay the piperâa good sumâ (I've got a conscience, maugre people's jokes;) To scrape a little favour 'gan to coax Her Highness' pug-dogâgot a sharp rebuffâ She wish'd a game at whistâmade three revokesâ Turn'd from myself, her partner, in a huff; His majesty will know her temper time enough. LXXIX âShe cried for chessâI play'd a game with herâ Castled her king with such a vixen look, It bodes ill to his Majestyâ(refer To the second chapter of my fortieth book, And see what hoity-toity airs she took). At half-past four the morn essay'd to beamâ Saluted, as we pass'd, an early rookâ The Princess fell asleep, and, in her dream, Talk'd of one Master Hubert, deep in her esteem. LXXX âAbout this time,âmaking delightful way,â Shed a quill-feather from my larboard wingâ Wish'd, trusted, hop'd 'twas no sign of decayâ Thank heaven, I'm hearty yet!â'twas no such thing:â At five the golden light began to spring, With fiery shudder through the bloomed east; At six we heard Panthea's churches ringâ The city all her unhiv'd swarms had cast, To watch our grand approach, and hail us as we pass'd. LXXXI âAs flowers turn their faces to the sun, So on our flight with hungry eyes they gaze, And, as we shap'd our course, this, that way run, With mad-cap pleasure, or hand-clasp'd amaze; Sweet in the air a mild-ton'd music plays, And progresses through its own labyrinth; Buds gather'd from the green spring's middle-days, They scatter'd,âdaisy, primrose, hyacinth,â Or round white columns wreath'd from capital to plinth. LXXXII âOnward we floated o'er the panting streets, That seem'd throughout with upheld faces paved; Look where we will, our bird's-eye vision meets Legions of holiday; bright standards waved, And fluttering ensigns emulously craved Our minute's glance; a busy thunderous roar, From square to square, among the buildings raved, As when the sea, at flow, gluts up once more The craggy hollowness of a wild reefed shore. LXXXIII âAnd âBellanaine for ever!â shouted they, While that fair Princess, from her winged chair, Bow'd low with high demeanour, and, to pay Their new-blown loyalty with guerdon fair, Still emptied, at meet distance, here and there, A plenty horn of jewels. And here I (Who wish to give the devil her due) declare Against that ugly piece of calumny, Which calls them Highland pebble-stones not worth a fly. LXXXIV âStill âBellanaine!â they shouted, while we glide 'Slant to a light Ionic portico, The city's delicacy, and the pride Of our Imperial Basilic; a row Of lords and ladies, on each hand, make show Submissive of knee-bent obeisance, All down the steps; and, as we enter'd, lo! The strangest sightâthe most unlook'd-for chanceâ All things turn'd topsy-turvy in a devil's dance. LXXXV â'Stead of his anxious Majesty and court At the open doors, with wide saluting eyes, CongÃ©es and scape-graces of every sort, And all the smooth routine of gallantries, Was seen, to our immoderate surprise, A motley crowd thick gather'd in the hall, Lords, scullions, deputy-scullions, with wild cries Stunning the vestibule from wall to wall, Where the Chief Justice on his knees and hands doth crawl. LXXXVI âCounts of the palace, and the state purveyor Of moth's-down, to make soft the royal beds, The Common Council and my fool Lord Mayor Marching a-row, each other slipshod treads; Powder'd bag-wigs and ruffy-tuffy heads Of cinder wenches meet and soil each other; Toe crush'd with heel ill-natur'd fighting breeds, Frill-rumpling elbows brew up many a bother, And fists in the short ribs keep up the yell and pother. LXXXVII âA Poet, mounted on the Court-Clown's back, Rode to the Princess swift with spurring heels, And close into her face, with rhyming clack, Began a Prothalamion;âshe reels, She falls, she faints! while laughter peals Over her woman's weakness. âWhere!â cried I, âWhere is his Majesty?â No person feels Inclin'd to answer; wherefore instantly I plung'd into the crowd to find him or to die. LXXXVIII âJostling my way I gain'd the stairs, and ran To the first landing, where, incredible! I met, far gone in liquor, that old man, That vile impostor Hum,ââ So far so well,â For we have prov'd the Mago never fell Down stairs on Crafticanto's evidence; And therefore duly shall proceed to tell, Plain in our own original mood and tense, The sequel of this day, though labour 'tis immense! LINES SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED TO FANNY BRAWNE This living hand, now warm and capable Of earnest grasping, would, if it were cold And in the icy silence of the tomb, So haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights That thou would[st] wish thine own heart dry of blood So in my veins red life might stream again, And thou be conscience-calm'dâsee here it isâ I hold it towards you. SONNET Written on a Blank Page in Shakespeare's Poems, facing âA Lover's Complaint.â Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou artâ Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night And watching, with eternal lids apart, Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite, The moving waters at their priestlike task Of pure ablution round earth's human shores, Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask Of snow upon the mountains and the moorsâ Noâyet still stedfast, still unchangeable, Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast, To feel for ever its soft fall and swell, Awake for ever in a sweet unrest, Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath, And so live everâor else swoon to death.</field>
