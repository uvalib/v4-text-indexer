      <field name="fulltext">GONDIBERT: AN HEROICK POEM, WRITTEN BY S? WILLIAM D'AVENANT. TO S? WILL. D'AVENANT, Upon his Two first BOOKS of GONDIBERT, Finishd before his Voyage to AMERICA. Thus the wise Nightingale that leaves her home, Her native Wood, when Storms and Winter come, Pursuing constantly the chearfull Spring, To forraign Groves does her old Musick bring: The drooping Hebrews banish'd Harps unstrung At Babilon, upon the Willowes hung; Yours sounds aloud, and tells us you excell No less in Courage, then in Singing well; Whilst unconcern'd you let your Country know, They have impov'rished themselves, not you; Who with the Muses help can mock those Fates Which threaten Kingdomes, and disorder States. So Ovid when from Cæsar's rage he fled, The Roman Muse to Pontus with him led; Where he so sung, that We through Pity's Glass, See Nero milder then Augustus was. Hereafter such in thy behalf shall be, Th' indulgent censure of Posterity. To banish those who with such art can sing, Is a rude Crime which its own Curse does bring: Ages to come shall ne'r know how they fought, Nor how to love their present youth be taught. This to thy self. Now to thy matchless Book VVherein those few that can with Judgment look, May find old Love in pure fresh language told, Like new stampt Coin made out of Angel-gold. Such truth in Love as th' antique World did know, In such a stile as Courts may boast of now Which no bold tales of Gods or Monsters swell, But humane Passions, such as with us dwell. Man is thy theame, his Vertue or his rage. Drawn to the life in each elaborate Page. Mars nor Bellona are not named here; But such a Gondibert as both might fear. Venus had here, and Hebe been out-shin'd By thy bright Birtha, and thy Rhodalind. Such is thy happy skill, and such the odds Betwixt thy Worthies and the Grecian Gods. Whose Deity's in vain had here come down, Where Mortall Beauty wears the Soveraign Crown; Such as of flesh compos'd, by flesh and blood (Though not resisted) may be understood. ED. WALLER. TO Sir WILLIAM D'AVENANT, Upon his Two first Books of GONDIBERT, Finish'd before his Voyage to America. Methinks Heroick Poesie till now, Like some fantastique Fairy-land did show; Gods, Devils, Nymphs, Witches, and Giants race, And all but Man, in Mans best Work had place. Thou like some worthy Knight, with sacred Arms Dost drive the Monsters thence, and end the Charms: Instead of these, dost Men and Manners plant, The things which that rich soyl did chiefly want. But even thy Mortals do their Gods excell, Taught by thy Muse to Fight and Love so well. By fatal hands whilst present Empires fall, Thine from the grave past Monarchies recall. So much more thanks from humane kind does merit The Poets Fury, then the Zelots Spirit. And from the grave, thou mak'st this Empire rise, Not like some dreadful Ghost t'affright our Eyes, But with more beauty and triumphant state, Then when it crown'd at proud Verona sate. So will our God re-build Mans perish'd frame, And raise him up much better, yet the same: So God-like Poets do past things rehearse, Not change, but heighten Nature with their Verse. With shame me thinks great Italy must see Her Conqu'rors call'd to life again by thee; Call'd by such powerful Arts, that ancient Rome May blush no less to see her Wit o'recome. Some Men their Fancies like their Faith derive; And count all ill but that which Rome does give; The marks of Old and Catholick would finde; To the same Chair would Truth and Fiction binde. Thou in these beaten paths disdain'st to tread, And scorn'st to Live by robbing of the Dead. Since Time doth all things change, thou thinkst not sit This latter Age should see all new but Wit. Thy Fancy, like a Flame, her way does make; And leaves bright tracks for following Pens to take. Sure 'twas this noble boldness of the Muse Did thy desire to seek new Worlds infuse; And ne'r did Heaven so much a Voyage bless, If thou canst Plant but there with like success. A B. COWLEY. GONDIBERT. THE FIRST BOOK. Canto the First. The ARGUMENT. Old Aribert's great race, and greater mind Is sung, with the renown of Rhodalind. Prince Oswald is compar'd to Gondibert, And justly each distinguish'd by desert: Whose Armies are in Fam's fair Field drawn forth, To shew by discipline their Leaders worth. 1 Of all the Lombards, by their Trophies known, Who sought Fame soon, and had her favor long, King Aribert best seem'd to fill the Throne; And bred most bus'ness for Heroick Song. 2 From early Childhoods promising estate, Up to performing Manhood, till he grew To fayling Age, he Agent was to Fate, And did to Nations Peace or War renew. 3 War was his study'd Art; war, which the bad Condemn, because even then it does them awe, When with their number lin'd, and purple clad, And to the good more needful is then Law. 4 To conquer Tumult, Nature's sudain force, War, Arts delib'rate strength, was first devis'd; Cruel to those whose rage has no remorse, Least civil pow'r should be by Throngs surpris'd. 5 The feeble Law rescues but doubtfully From the Oppressors single Arme our right; Till to its pow'r the wise war's help apply; Which soberly does Man's loose rage unite. 6 Yet since on all War never needful was, Wise Aribert did keep the People sure By Laws from little dangers; for the Laws Them from themselves, and not from pow'r secure. 7 Else Conquerors, by making Laws, o'recome Their own gain'd pow'r, and leave mens fury free; Who growing deaf to pow'r, the Laws grow dumb; Since none can plead where all may Judges bee. 8 Prais'd was this King for war, the Laws broad shield; And for acknowledg'd Laws, the art of Peace; Happy in all which Heav'n to Kings does yield, But a successor when his cares shall cease. 9 For no male Pledge, to give a lasting name, Sprung from his bed, yet Heaven to him allow'd One of the gentler sex, whose Story Fame Has made my Song, to make the Lombards proud. 10 Recorded Rhodalind! whose high renown Who miss in Books, not luckily have read; Or vex'd by living beauties of their own Have shunn'd the wise Records of Lovers dead. 11 Her Fathers prosp'rous Palace was the Sphear Where she to all with Heav'nly order mov'd; Made rigid vertue so benigne appear That 'twas without Religion's help belov'd. 12 Her looks like Empire shew'd, great above pride; Since pride ill counterfeits excessive height; But Nature publish'd what she fain would hide; Who for her deeds, not beauty, lov'd the light. 13 To make her lowly mindes appearance less, She us'd some outward greatness for disguise; Esteem'd as pride the Cloyst'ral lowliness, And thought them proud who even the proud despise. 14 Her Father (in the winter of his age) Was like that stormy season froward grown. Whom so her youthful presence did asswage, That he her sweetness tasted as his own. 15 The pow'r that with his stooping age declin'd, In her transplanted, by remove increas'd; Which doubly back in homage she resign'd; Till pow'rs decay, the Thrones worst sickness, ceas'd. 16 Oppressors big with pride, when she appear'd Blushed, and believ'd their greatness counterfeit; The lowly thought they them in vain had fear'd; Found vertue harmless, and nought else so great, 17 Her minde (scarce to her feeble sex a kinn) Did as her birth, her right to Empire show; Seem'd careless outward when imploy'd within; Her speech, like lovers watch'd, was kind and low. 18 She shew'd that her soft sex containes strong mindes, Such as evap'rates through the courser Male, As through course stone Elixer passage findes, Which scarce through finer Christal can exhale. 19 Her beauty (not her own but Nature's pride) Should I describe; from ev'ry Lovers eye All Beauties this original must hide, Or like scorn'd Copies be themselves laid by; 20 Be by their Poets shunn'd, whom beauty feeds; Who beauty like hyr'd witnesses protect, Officiously averring more then needs, And make us so the needful truth suspect. 21 And since fond Lovers (who disciples bee To Poets) think in their own loves they find More beauty then yet Time did ever see, Time's Curtain I will draw o're Rhodalind. 22 Least shewing her, each sees how much he errs, Doubt since their own have less, that they have none; Believe their Poets perjur'd Flatterers, And then all Modern Maids would be undone. 23 In Pity thus, her beauty's just renown I wave for publick Peace, and will declare To whom the King design'd her with his Crown; Which is his last and most unquiet care. 24 If in allyance he does greatness prise, His Minde grown Weary, need not travail farre; If greatness be compos'd of Victories, He has at home many that Victors are. 25 Many whom blest success did often grace In Fields, where they have seeds of Empire sown; And hope to make, since born of princely race, Even her (the harvest of those toyls) their own. 26 And of those Victors Two are chiefly fam'd, To whom the rest their proudest hopes resigne; Though young, were in their Fathers batails nam'd, And both are of the Lombards Royal Line. 27 Oswald the great, and greater Gondibert! Both from succesfull conqu'ring Fathers sprung; Whom both examples made of Warr's high art, And farr out-wrought their patterns being young. 28 Yet for full fame (as Trine Fame's Judge reports) Much to Duke Gondibert Prince Oswald yields; Was less in mighty misteries of Courts, In peaceful Cities, and in fighting Fields. 29 In Court Prince Oswald costly was and gay, Finer then near vain Kings their Fav'rites are; Outshin'd bright Fav'rites on their Nuptial day; Yet were his Eyes dark with ambitious care. 30 Duke Gondibert was still more gravely clad, But yet his looks familiar were and clear; As if with ill to others never sad, Nor tow'rds himself could others practice fear. 31 The Prince, could Porpoise-like in Tempests play, And in Court storms on shipwrack'd Greatness feed; Not frighted with their fate when cast away, But to their glorious hazards durst succeed. 32 The Duke would lasting calmes to Courts assure, As pleasant Gardens we defend from windes; For he who bus'ness would from Storms procure, Soon his affairs above his mannage findes. 33 Oswald in Throngs the abject People sought With humble looks; who still too late will know They are Ambition's Quarry, and soon caught When the aspiring Eagle stoops so low. 34 The Duke did these by steady Vertue gain; Which they in action more then precept tast; Deeds shew the Good, and those who goodness feign By such even through their vizards are out-fac't. 35 Oswald in war was worthily renown'd; Though gay in Courts, coursly in Camps could live; Judg'd danger soon, and first was in it found; Could toyl to gain what he with ease did give. 36 Yet toyls and dangers through. ambition lov'd; Which does in war the name of Vertue own; But quits that name when from the war remov'd, As Rivers theirs when from their Channels gon. 37 The Duke (as restless as his fame in warre) With martial toyl could Oswald weary make; And calmly do what he with rage did dare, And give so much as he might deign to take. 38 Him as their Founder Cities did adore; The Court he knew to steer in storms of State; In Fields a Battle lost he could restore, And after force the Victors to their Fate. 39 In Camps now chiefly liv'd, where he did aime At graver glory then Ambition breeds; Designes that yet this story must not name, Which with our Lombard Authors pace proceds. 40 The King adopts this Duke in secret thought To wed the Nations wealth, his onely child, Whom Oswald as reward of merit sought, With Hope, Ambition's common Baite, beguild. 41 This as his souls chief secret was unknowne, Least Oswald that his proudest Army led Should force possession ere his hopes were gone, Who could not rest but in the royal bed. 42 The Duke discern'd not that the King design'd To chuse him Heir of all his victories; Nor guess'd that for his love fair Rhodalind Made sleep of late a stranger to her Eies. 43 Yet sadly it is sung that she in shades Mildly as mourning Doves love's sorrows felt; Whilst in her secret tears her freshness fades As Roses silently in Lymbecks melt. 44 But who could know her love, whose jealous shame Deny'd her Eyes the knowledge of her glass; Who blushing thought Nature her self too blame By whom Men guess of Maids more then the face. 45 Yet judge not that this Duke (though from his sight With Maids first fears she did her passion hide) Did need lov's flame for his directing light, But rather wants Ambition for his Guide. 46 Love's fire he carry'd, but no more in view Then vital heat which kept his heart still warm; This Maids in Oswald as love's Beacon knew; The publick flame to bid them flye from harm. 47 Yet since this Duke could love, we may admire Why love ne'r rais'd his thoughts to Rodalind; But those forget that earthly flames aspire, Whilst Heav'nly beames, which purer are, descend. 48 As yet to none could he peculiar prove, But like an universal Influence (For such and so sufficient was his love) To all the Sex he did his heart dispence. 49 But Oswald never knew love's ancient Laws, The awe that Beauty does in lovers breed, Those short breath'd fears and paleness it does cause When in a doubtful Brow their doom they read. 50 Not Rhodalind (whom then all Men as one Did celebrate, as with confed'rate Eyes) Could he effect but shining in her Throne; Blindly a Throne did more then beauty prise. 51 He by his Sister did his hopes prefer; A beauteous pleader who victorious was O're Rhodalind, and could subdue her Ear In all requests but this unpleasant cause. 52 Gartha, whose bolder beauty was in strength And fulness plac'd, but such as all must like; Her spreading stature talness was, not length, And whilst sharpe beauties peirce, hers seem'd to strike. 53 Such goodly presence ancient Poets grace, Whose songs the worlds first manliness declare; To Princes Beds teach carefulness of Race; Which now store Courts, that us'd to store the warre. 54 Such was the Palace of her Minde, a Prince Who proudly there, and still unquiet lives; And sleep (domestick ev'ry where) from thence, To make Ambition room, unwisely drives. 55 Of manly force was this her watchful mind, And fit in Empire to direct and sway; If she the temper had of Rhodalind. Who knew that Gold is currant with allay. 56 As Kings (oft slaves to others hopes and skill) Are urg'd to war to load their slaves with spoyles; So Oswald was push'd up Ambition's hill, And so some urg'd the Duke to martial toyles. 57 And these who for their own great cause so high Would lift their Lords Two prosp'rous Armies are, Return'd from far to fruitful Lombardy, And paid with rest, the best reward of warre. 58 The old neer Brescia lay, scarce warm'd with Tents; For though from danger safe, yet Armies then Their posture kept 'gainst warring Elements, And hardness learn'd against more warring Men. 59 Neer Bergamo encamp'd the younger were, Whom to the Franks distress the Duke had led; The other Oswald's lucky Ensigns bear, Which lately stood when proud Ovenna fled. 60 These that attend Duke Gondibert's renown Were Youth whom from his Fathers Campe he chose. And them betimes transplanted to his own; Where each the Planters care and judgment shows. 61 All hardy Youth, from valiant Fathers sprung; Whom perfect honor he so highly taught, That th' Aged fetch'd examples from the young, And hid the vain experience which they brought. 62 They danger met diverted less with fears Then now the dead would be if here again, After they know the price brave dying bears; And by their sinless rest find life was vain. 63 Temp'rate in what does needy life preserve, As those whose Bodies wait upon their Mindes; Chaste as those Mindes which not their Bodies serve; Ready as Pilots wak'd with suddain Windes. 64 Speechless in diligence, as if they were Nightly to close surprise and Ambush bred; Their wounds yet smarting merciful they are, And soon from victory to pity led. 65 When a great Captive they in fight had ta'ne, (Whom in a Filial duty some fair Maid Visits, and would by tears his freedom gain) How soon his Victors were her Captives made? 66 For though the Duke taught rigid Discipline, He let them beauty thus at distance know; As Priests discover some more Sacred Shrine, Which none must touch, yet all may to it bow. 67 When thus as Sutors mourning Virgins pass Through their clean Camp, themselves in form they draw, That they with Martial reverence may grace Beauty, the Stranger, which they seldom saw. 68 They vayl'd their Ensignes as it by did move, Whilst inward (as from Native Conscience) all Worshipp'd the Poets Darling Godhead, Love, Which grave Philosophers did Nature call. 69 Nor there could Maids of Captives Syres dispaire, But made all Captives by their beauty free; Beauty and Valor native Jewels are, And as each others only price agree. 70 Such was the Duke's young Camp by Bergamo, But these near Brescia whom fierce Oswald led, Their Science to his famous Father owe, And have his Son (though now their Leader) bred. 71 This rev'rend Army was for age renown'd; Which long through frequent dangers follow'd Time; Their many Trophies gain'd with many'a wound, And Fame's last Hill, did with first vigour climbe. 72 But here the learned Lombard whom I trace My forward Pen by slower Method stays; Least I should them (less heeding time and place Then common Poets) out of season praise. 73 Think onely then (couldst thou both Camps discern) That these would seem grave Authors of the war, Met civilly to teach who e're will learn, And those their young and civil Students are. 74 But painful vertue of the war ne'r pays It self with consciousness of being good, Though Cloyster'd vertue may believe even praise A sallary which there should be withstood: 75 For many here (whose vertue's active heat Concurs not with cold vertue which does dwell, In lasie Cells) are vertuous to be great, And as in pains so would in pow'r excell. 76 And Oswald's Faction urg'd him to aspire That by his height they higher might ascend; The Dukes to glorious Thrones access desire, But at more awful distance did attend. 77 The Royal Rhodalind is now the Prize By which these Camps would make their merit known; And think their General's but their Deputies Who must for them by Proxy wed the Crown. 78 From forreign Fields (with toyling conquest tyr'd, And groaning under spoiles) come home to rest; There now they are with emulation fyr'd, And for that pow'r they should obey, contest. 79 Ah how perverse and froward is Mankinde! Faction in Courts does us to rage excite; The Rich in Cities we litigious find, And in the Field th'Ambitious make us fight: 80 And fatally (as if even soules were made Of warring Elements as Bodies are) Our Reason our Religion does invade, Till from the Schools to Camps it carry war. Canto the Second. The ARGUMENT. The hunting which did yearly celebrate The Lombards glory, and the Vandales Fate. The Hunters prais'd; how true to love they are, How calm in Peace, and Tempest-like in warre. The Stagg is by the num'rous Chace subdu'd, And strait his Hunters are as hard pursu'd. 1 Small are the seeds Fate does unheeded sow Of slight beginnings to important ends; Whilst wonder (which does best our rev'rence show To Heav'n) all Reasons sight in gazing spends. 2 For from a Dayes brief pleasure did proceed (A day grown black in Lombard Histories) Such lasting griefs as thou shalt weep to read, Though even thine own sad love had drain'd thine Eyes. 3 In a fair Forrest neer Verona's Plain, Fresh as if Nature's Youth chose there a shade, The Duke with many Lovers in his Train, (Loyal, and young) a solemn hunting made. 4 Much was his Train enlarg'd by their resort Who much his Grandsire lov'd, and hither came To celebrate this Day with annual sport, On which by battel here he earn'd his Fame. 5 And many of these noble Hunters bore Command amongst the Youth at Bergamo; Whose Fathers gather'd here the wreaths they wore, When in this Forrest they interr'd the Foe. 6 Count Hurgonil, a Youth of high descent, Was listed here, and in the story great; He follow'd Honor, when tow'rd's Death it went; Fierce in a charge but temp'rate in retreat. 7 His wondrous beauty which the world approv'd He blushing hid, and now no more would own (Since he the Duke's unequal'd Sister lov'd) Then an old wreath when newly overthrown. 8 And she, Orna the shy! Did seem in life So bashful too to have her beauty shown, As I may doubt her shade with Fame at strife, That in these vicious times would make it known 9 Not less in publick voice was Arnold here; He that on Tuscan Tombs his Trophys rais'd; And now love's pow'r so willingly did bear, That even his arbitrary raign he prais'd. 10 Laura, the Duke's fair Neice inthrall'd his heart; Who was in Court the publick morning Glass Where those who would reduce Nature to art, Practis'd by dress the conquests of the Face. 11 And here was Hugo whom Duke Gondibert For stout and stedfast kindness did approve; Of stature small, but was all over heart, And though unhappy all that heart was love. 12 In gentile sonnets he for Laura pin'd, Soft as the murmures of a weeping spring; Which ruthless she did as those murmures mind: So ere their death sick Swans unheeded sing. 13 Yet whilst she Arnold favour'd, he so griev'd As loyall Subjects quietly bemone Their Yoke, but raise no warr to be reliev'd, Nor through the envy'd Fav'rite wound the Throne. 14 Young Goltho next these Rivals we may name, Whose manhood dawn'd early as Summer light; As sure and soon did his fair day proclaime, And was no less the joy of publick sight. 15 If Love's just pow'r he did not early see, Some small excuse we may his error give; Since few (though learn'd) know yet blest Love to be That secret vitall heat by which we live: 16 But such it is; and though we may be thought To have in Childhood life, ere Love we know, Yet life is useless till by reason taught, And Love and Reason up together grow. 17 Nor more, the Old shew they out-live their Love, If when their Love's decay'd, some signes they give Of life, because we see them pain'd and move, Then Snakes, long cut, by torment shew they live. 18 If we call living, Life, when Love is gone, We then to Souls (Gods coyne) vain rev'rence pay; Since Reason (which is Love, and his best known And currant Image) Age has worne away. 19 And I that Love and Reason thus unite, May, if I old Philosophers controule, Confirme the new by some new Poets light; Who finding Love, thinks he has found the Soule. 20 From Goltho, to whom love yet tasteless seem'd, We to ripe Tybalt are by order led; Tybalt, who Love and Valor both esteem'd, And he alike from eithers wounds had bled. 21 Publique his valor was, but not his love, One fill'd the world, the other he contain'd; Yet quietly alike in both did move, Of that ne'r boasted, nor of this complain'd. 22 With these (whose special names Verse shall preserve) Many to this recorded hunting came; Whose worth authentick mention did deserve, But from Time's deluge few are sav'd by Fame. 23 Now like a Giant Lover rose the Sun From th'Ocean Queen, fine in his fires and great; Seem'd all the Morne for shew, for strength at Noone; As if last Night she had not quench'd his heate! 24 And the Sun's Servants who his rising waite, His Pensioners (for so all Lovers are, And all maintain'd by him at a high rate With daily fire) now for the Chace prepare. 25 All were like Hunters clad in cheerfull green, Young Natures Livery, and each at strife Who most adorn'd in favours should be seen, Wrought kindly by the Lady of his life. 26 These Martiall Favours on their Wasts they weare, On which (for now they Conquest celebrate) In an imbroider'd History appeare Like life, the vanquish'd in their feares and fate. 27 And on these Belts (wrought with their Ladys care) Hung Semyters of Akons trusty steele; Goodly to see, and he who durst compare Those Ladies Eies, might soon their temper feele. 28 Cheer'd as the Woods (where new wak'd Quires they meet) Are all; and now dispose their choice Relays Of Horse and Hounds, each like each other fleet; Which best when with themselves compar'd we praise; 29 To them old Forrest Spys, the Harborers VVith hast approach, wet as still weeping Night, Or Deer that mourn their growth of head with tears, VVhen the defenceless weight does hinder flight. 30 And Doggs, such whose cold secrecy was ment By Nature for surprise, on these attend; Wise temp'rate Lime-Hounds that proclaim no scent; Nor Harb'ring will their Mouths in boasting spend. 31 Yet vainlier farr then Traytors boast their prise (On which their vehemence vast rates does lay, Since in that worth their treasons credit lies) These Harb'rers praise that which they now betray: 32 Boast they have lodg'd a Stagg, that all the Race Out-runs of Croton Horse, or Regian Hounds; A Stagg made long, since Royall in the Chace, If Kings can honor give by giving wounds. 33 For Aribert had pierc't him at a Bay, Yet scap'd he by the vigour of his Head; And many a Summer since has wonn the day, And often left his Regian Foll'wers dead: 34 His spacious Beame (that even the Rights out-grew) From Antlar to his Troch had all allow'd By which his age the aged Wood-men knew; Who more then he were of that beauty proud. 35 Now each Relay a sev'ral Station findes, Ere the triumphant Train the Copps surrounds; Relayes of Horse, long breath'd as winter windes, And their deep Cannon Mouth'd experienc'd Hounds.) 36 The Huntsmen (busily concern'd in show As if the world were by this Beast undone, And they against him hir'd as Nature's Foe) In haste uncouple, and their Hounds outrun. 37 Now winde they a Recheat, the rous'd Dear's knell; And through the Forrest all the Beasts are aw'd; Alarm'd by Eccho, Nature's Sentinel, Which shews that Murd'rous Man is come abroad. 38 Tyranique Man! Thy subjects Enemy! And more through wantonness then need or hate; From whom the winged to their Coverts flie; And to their Dennes even those that lay in waite. 39 So this (the most successfull of his kinde, Whose Foreheads force oft his Opposers prest, Whose swiftness left Persuers shafts behinde) Is now of all the Forrest most distrest! 40 The Heard deny him shelter, as if taught To know their safety is to yield him lost; Which shews they want not the results of thought, But speech, by which we ours for reason boast. 41 We blush to see our politicks in Beasts, Who many sav'd by this one Sacrifice; And since through blood they follow interests, Like us when cruel should be counted wise. 42 His Rivals that his fury us'd to fear For his lov'd Female, now his faintness Shun; But were his season hot, and she but neer, (O mighty Love!) his Hunters were undone. 43 From thence, well blown, he comes to the Relay; Where Man's fam'd reason proves but Cowardise, And only serves him meanly to betray; Even for the flying, Man, in ambush lies. 44 But now, as his last remedy to live, (For ev'ry shift for life kind Nature makes, Since life the utmost is which she can give) Coole Adice from the swoln Bank he takes. 45 But this fresh Bath the Doggs will make him leave; Whom he sure nos'd as fasting Tygers found; Their scent no North-east winde could e're deceave Which drives the ayre, nor Flocks that foyl the Ground. 46 Swift here the Flyers and Persuers seeme; The frighted Fish swim from their Adice, The Doggs pursue the Deer, he the fleet streme, And that hasts too to th' Adriatick Sea. 47 Refresh'd thus in this fleeting Element, He up the stedfast Shore did boldly rise; And soon escap'd their view, but not their scent; That faithful Guide which even conducts their Eyes. 48 This frail relief was like short gales of breath Which oft at Sea a long dead calme prepare; Or like our Curtains drawn at point of death, When all our Lungs are spent, to give us ayre, 49 For on the Shore the Hunters him attend; And whilst the Chace grew warm as is the day (Which now from the hot Zenith does descend) He is imbos'd, and weary'd to a Bay. 50 The Jewel, Life, he must surrender here; Which the world's Mistris, Nature, does not give, But like drop'd Favours suffers us to weare, Such as by which pleas'd Lovers think they live. 51 Yet life he so esteems, that he allows It all defence his force and rage can make; And to the eager Dogs such fury shows As their last blood some unreveng'd forsake. 52 But now the Monarch Murderer comes in, Destructive Man! whom Nature would not arme, As when in madness mischief is foreseen We leave it weaponless for fear of harme. 53 For she defenceless made him that he might Less readily offend; but Art Armes all, From single strife makes us in Numbers fight; And by such art this Royall Stagg did fall. 54 He weeps till grief does even his Murd'rers pierce; Grief which so nobly through his anger strove, That it deserv'd the dignity of verse, And had it words as humanly would move. 55 Thrice from the ground his vanquish'd Head he rear'd, And with last looks his Forrest walks did view; Where Sixty Summers he had rul'd the Heatd, And where sharp Dittany now vainly grew: 56 Whose hoary Leaves no more his wounds shall heale; For with a Sigh (a blast of all his breath) That viewless thing call'd Life, did from him steale; And with their Bugle Hornes they winde his death. 57 Then with their annuall wanton sacrifice (Taught by old Custome, whose decrees are vain, And we like hum'rous Antiquaries prise Age though deform'd) they hasten to the Plain. 58 Thence homeward bend as westward as the Sun; Where Gondibert's Allys proud Feasts prepare, That day to honor which his Grandsire won; Though Feasts the Eves to Fun'ralls often are. 59 One from the Forrest now approach'd their sight, Who them did swiftly on the Spurr pursue; One there still resident as Day and Night, And known as th' eldest Oke which in it grew. 60 Who with his utmost breath, advancing cries (And such a vehemence no Art could feigne) Away, happy the Man that fastest flies; Flie famous Duke, flie with thy noble Traine! 61 The Duke reply'd, though with thy fears disguis'd, Thou do'st my Syres old Rangers Image beare, And for thy kindness shalt not be despis'd; Though Councels are but weak which come from fear. 62 Were Dangers here, great as thy love can shape; (And love with fear can danger multiply) Yet when by flight, thou bidst us meanly scape, Bid Trees take wings, and rooted Forests flie. 63 Then said the Ranger, you are bravely lost, (And like high anger his complexion rose) As little know I fear, as how to boast; But shall attend you through your many Foes. 64 See where in ambush mighty Oswald lay; And see, from yonder Lawne he moves apace, VVith Launces arm'd to intercept thy way, Now thy sure Steeds are weary'd with the Chace. 65 His purple Banners you may there behold, Which (proudly spred) the fatall Raven beare; And full five hundred I by Ranke have told, Who in their guilded Helmes his Colours weare. 66 The Duke this falling storme does now discern; Bids little Hugo fly! but'tis to view The Foe, and timely their first count'nance learne, Whilst firme he in a square his Hunters drew. 67 And Hugo soon (light as his Coursers Heeles) Was in their Faces troublesome as winde; And like to it (so wingedly He wheeles) No one could catch, what all with trouble finde: 68 But ev'ry where the Leaders and the Led He temp'rately observ'd, with a slow sight; Judg'd by their looks how hopes and feares were fed, And by their order their success in fight. 69 Their Number ('mounting to the Rangers guesse) In Three Divisions ev'nly was dispos'd; And that their Enemies might judge it lesse, It seem'd one Grosse with all the Spaces clos'd. 70 The Vann fierce Oswald led, where Paradine And Manly Dargonet (both of his blood) Outshin'd the Noone, and their Mindes stock within Promis'd to make that outward glory good. 71 The next, bold, but unlucky Hubert led; Brother to Oswald, and no less ally'd To the ambitions which his Soul did wed; Lowly without, but lin'd with Costly pride. 72 Most to himself his valor fatall was, Whose glorys oft to others dreadfull were; So Comets (though suppos'd Destruction's cause) But waste themselves to make their Gazers feare. 73 And though his valor seldom did succeed, His speech was such as could in Storms perswade; Sweet as the Hopes on which starv'd Lovers feed, Breath'd in the whispers of a yielding Maide. 74 The Bloody Borgio did conduct the Rere; VVhom sullen Vasco heedfully attends; To all but to themselves they cruel were, And to themselves chiefly by mischief Friends. 75 Warr, the worlds Art, Nature to them became; In Camps begot, born, and in anger bred; The living vex'd till Death, and then their Fame; Because even Fame some life is to the Dead. 76 Cities (wise States-men's Folds for civil sheep) They sack'd, as painful Sheerers of the wise; For they like careful VVolves would lose their sleep, VVhen others prosp'rous toyls might be their prise. 77 Hugo amongst these Troops spy'd many more Who had, as brave Destroyers, got renown; And many forward wounds in boast they wore; Which if not well reveng'd, had ne'r been shown. 78 Such the bold Leaders of these Launceers were, Which of the Brescian Vet'rans did consist; Whose practis'd age might charge of Armies bear, And claim some ranck in Fame's eternal List. 79 Back to his Duke the dext'rous Hugo flies; What he observ'd he cheerfully declares; VVith noble pride did what he lik'd despise; For wounds he threatned whil'st he prais'd their skarrs. 80 Lord Arnold cry'd, vain is the Bugle Horn, VVhere Trumpets Men to Manly work invite! That distant summons seems to say in skorn, VVe Hunters may be hunted hard ere night. 81 Those Beasts are hunted hard that hard can fly, Reply'd aloud the noble Hurgonil; But we not us'd to flight, know best to die; And those who know to die, know how to kill. 82 Victors through number never gain'd applause; If they exceed our compt in Armes and Men, It is not just to think that odds, because One Lover equals any other Ten. Canto the Third. The ARGUMENT. The Ambush is become an interview; And the Surpriser proves to honor true; For what had first, ere words his fury spent, Been murder, now, is but brave killing ment. A duel form'd where Princes Seconds are, And urg'd by Honor each to kill his share. 1 The Duke observ'd (whilst safe in his firm Square) Whether their front did change whom Oswald led; That thence he shifts of figure might prepare Divide, or make more depth, or loosely spred. 2 Though in their posture close, the Prince might guess The Duke's to his not much in number yield; And they were leading Youth who would possess This Ground in Graves, rather then quit the Field. 3 Thus (timely certain of a standing Foe) His form'd Divisions yet reveal'd no space Through haste to charge; but as they nearer grow, They more divide, and move with slower pace. 4 On these the Duke attends with watchful Eye; Shap'd all his Forces to their Triple strength; And that their Launces might pass harmless by, Widens his Ranks, and gave his Files more length. 5 At distance Oswald does him sharply view, Whom but in Fame he met till this sad hour; But his fair fame, Vertue's known Image, knew; Vertue exalts the Owner more then pow'r. 6 In Fields far sever'd both had reap'd renown; And now his envie does to surfeit feed On what he wish'd his Eies had never known; For he begins to check his purpos'd deed. 7 And though Ambition did his rage renew; Yet much he griev'd (mov'd with the Youthful Train That Plants which so much promis'd as they grew, Should in the bud be ere performance slain. 8 With these remorseful thoughts, he a fair space Advanc'd alone, Then did his Troops Command To halt; the Duke th' example did embrace, And gives like order by his lifted hand. 9 Then when in easie reach of eithers voice Thus Oswald spake. I wish (brave Gondibert) Those wrongs which make the now my angers choice, Like my last fate were hidden from my heart. 10 But since great Glory does allow small rest, And bids us jealously to honour wake, Why at alarms given hot even at my brest, Should I not arm, but think my Scouts mistake; 11 'Tis lowd in Camps, in Cities, and in Court, (Where the important part of Mankind meets) That my adoption is thy Faction's sport, Scorn'd by hoarse Rymers in Verona Streets. 12 Who is renown'd enongh but you or I (And think not when you visit Fame, she less Will welcome you for my known Companie) To hope for Empire at our Kings decease? 13 The Crown he with his Daughter has design'd; His favor (which to me does frosen prove) Grows warm to you as th'eies of Rhodalind, And she gives sacred Empire with her love. 14 Whilst you usurp thus, and my claime deride, If you admire the veng'ance I intend, I more shall wonder where you got the pride To think me one you safely may offend. 15 Nor judg it strange I have this Ambush laid; Since you (my Rival) wrong'd me by surprise; Whose darker vigilance my love betrai'd; And so your ill example made we wise. 16 But in the Schoole of glory we are taught, That greatness and success should measure deeds; Then not my great revenge nor your great fault, Can be accus'd when eithers act succeeds. 17 Opinions stamp does vertue currant make; But such small Money (though the Peoples Gold With which they trade) great Dealers skorne to take, And we are greater then one world can hold. 18 Now Oswald paws'd, as if he curious were Ere this his Foe (the People's Fav'rite) dy'd, To know him as with Eies so with his Eare; And to his speech thus Gondibert reply'd: 19 Succesful Prince! since I was never taught To court a Threatning Foe, I will not pay For all the Trophys you from war have brought One single wreath, though all these woods were Bay! 20 Nor would I by a total silence yield My honour ta'ne, though I were Pris'ner made; Least you should think we may be justly kill'd, And sacred justice by mistake invade. 21 You might perceive (had not a distant warre Hindred our Breasts the use of being known) My small ambition hardly worth your care; Unless by it you would correct your owne. 22 The King's objected love is but your dreame, As false as that I strive for Rhodalind As valor's hyre; these sickly visions seeme Which in Ambitions Feaver vex your minde. 23 Nor wonder if I vouch, that 'tis not brave To seek war's hire, though war we still pursue; Nor censure this a proud excuse, to save These who no safety know, but to subdue. 24 Your misbelief my hireless, valour scorns; But your hir'd valour were your faith reclaim'd, (For faith reclaim'd to highest vertue turns) Will be of bravest sallary asham'd. 25 Onely with fame valor of old was hir'd; And love was so suffic'd with it's own taste, That those intemp'rate seem'd, who more desir'd For love's reward, then that it self should last. 26 If love, or lust of Empire bred your pain, Take what my prudent hope hath still declin'd, And my weak vertue never could sustain, The Crown, which is the worst of Rhodalind. 27 'Tis she who taught you to encrease renown, By sowing Honor's field with noble deeds; Which yields no harvest when 'tis over-grown With wilde Ambition, the most rank of weeds. 28 Go reconcile the windes faln out at sea With these tame precepts, (Oswald did replie) But since thou dost bequeath thy hopes to me, Know Legacies are vain till Givers die. 29 And here his rage ascended to his Eies From his close Brest, which hid till then the flame; And like stirr'd fire in sparkles upward flies; Rage which the Duke thus practis'd to reclaim. 30 Though you design'd our ruine by surprise, Though much in useful Armes you us exced, And in your number some advantage lies, Yet you may finde you such advantage need. 31 If I am vallew'd as th'impediment Which hinders your adoption to the Crown; Let your revenge only on me be spent; And hazard not my Party, nor your own. 32 Ambition else would up to Godhead grow, When so profanely we our anger prise, That to appease it we the blood allow Of whole offencelesse Herds for sacrifice. 33 Oswald (who Honor's publick pattern was, Till vain ambition led his heart aside) More temp'rate grew in mannage of his cause, And thus to noble Gondibert reply'd. 34 I wish it were not needful to be great; That Heav'ns unenvy'd pow'r might Men so awe As we should need no Armies for defeat, Nor for protection be at charge of Law. 35 But more then Heav'ns, Men, Man's authoritie (Though envy'd) use, because more understood; For, but for that, Life's Utensils would be, In Markets, as in Camps the price of blood. 36 Since the Worlds safety we in greatness finde. And pow'r divided is from greatness gone, Save we the world, though to our selves unkinde, By both indang'ring to establish one. 37 Not these, who kindle with my wrongs theire rage, Nor those bold Youth who warmly you attend, Our distant Camps by action shall ingage; But we our own great cause will singly end. 38 Back to your noble Hunters strait retire, And I to those who would those Hunters chace; Let us perswade their fury to expire, And give obediently our anger place. 39 Like unconcern'd Spectators let them stand, And be by sacred vow to distance bound; Whilst their lov'd Leaders by our strict command, Only as witnesses, approach this ground. 40 Where with no more defensive Armes then was By Nature ment us, who ordain'd Men Friends, We will on foot determine our great cause; On which the Lombards doubtful peace depends 41 The Duke at this did bow, and soon obay, Confess'd his honor he transcendent findes, Said he their persons might a meaner way With ods have aw'd, but this subdues their Mindes. 42 Now wing'd with Hope they to their Troops return, Oswald his old Grave Brescians makes retire, Least if too neer, though like slow Match they burn, The Duke's rash Youth like Powder might take fire. 43 First with their noble Chiefs they treat aside, Plead it humanity to bleed alone, And term it needless cruelty and pride With others Sacrifice to grace their owne. 44 Then to the Troopes gave their resolv'd command Not to assist, through anger nor remorse; Who seem'd more willing patiently to stand, Because each side presum'd their Champion's force. 45 Now neer that ground ordain'd by them and Fate To be the last where one or both must tread, Their chosen Judges they appoint to waite; Who thither were like griev'd Spectators led. 46 These from the distant Troops far sever'd are; And neer their Chiefs divided Stations take; Who strait uncloath, and for such deeds prepare, By which strip'd Soules their fleshy Robes forsake. 47 But Hubert now advanc'd, and cry'd alow'd I will not trust uncertain Destinie, Which may obscurely kill me in a Crowd, That here have pow'r in publick view to die. 48 Oswald my Brother is! If any dare Think Gondibert's great name more Kingly sounds, Let him alight, and he shall leave the care Of chusing Monarchs, to attend his wounds! 49 This Hurgonill receiv'd with greedy Ear, Told him his summons boldly did express, That he had little judgement whom to fear, And in the choice of Kings his skill was less, 50 With equal haste they then alight and met, Where both their Chiefs in preparation stood; Whilst Paradine and furious Dargonet Cry'd out, we are of Oswald's Princely blood. 51 Are there not yet two more so fond of fame, So true to Gondibert, or Love's commands; As to esteem it an unpleasant shame With idle Eies to look on busie hands? 52 Such haste makes Beauty when it youth forsakes, And day from Travellers when it does set, As Arnold to proud Paradine now makes, And little Hugo to tall Dargonet. 53 The bloody Borgio, who with anguish stay'd, And check'd his rage, till these of Oswald's Race, By wish'd example their brave Challenge made, Now like his curb'd Steed foaming, shifts his place. 54 And thus (with haste and choller hoarse) he spake; Who e're amongst you thinks we destin'd are To serve that King your Courtly Camp shall make, Falsly he loves, nor is his Lady faire! 55 This scarce could urge the temp'rate Tybalt's fire, Who said, when Fate shall Artbert remove, As ill then wilt thou judge who should aspire, As who is fair, that art too rude to love. 56 But scarce had this reply reach'd Borgio's Eare, When Goltho louder cry'd, what ere he be Dares think her foul who hath a Lover here, Though Love I never knew, shall now know me! 57 Grave Tybalt, who had laid an early'r claime To this defiance, much distemper'd grows, And Goltho's forward youth would sharply blame, But that old Vasco thus did interpose. 58 That Boy who makes such haste to meet his fate, And fears he may (as if he knew it good) Through others pride of danger come too late, Shall read it strait ill written in his blood. 59 Let Empire fall, when we must Monarchs choose, By what unpractis'd Childhood shall approve; And in tame peace let us our Manhood loose, When Boyes yet wet with milk discourse of Love. 60 As bashful Maids blush, as if justly blam'd, When forc'd to suffer some indecent Tongue, So Goltho blush'd (whom Vasco made asham'd) As if he could offend by being young. 61 But instantly offended bashfulness Does to a brave and beauteous anger turn; Which he in younger flames did so express, That scarce old Vasco's Embers seem'd to burn. 62 The Princes knew in this new kindled rage, Opinion might (have like unlucky winde State right to make it spread) their Troops ingage; And therefore Oswald thus proclaim'd his minde. 63 Seem we already dead, that to our words (As to the last requests men dying make) Your love but Mourners short respect affords, And ere interr'd you our commands forsake? 64 We chose you Judges of your needful strife, Such whom the world (grown faithless) might esteem As weighty witnesses of parting life, But you are those we dying must condemn. 65 Are we become such worthless sacrifice, As cannot to the Lombards Heav'n atone, Unless your added blood make up the price, As if you thought it worthier then our own? 66 Our Fame which should survive, before us dy! And let (since in our presence disobay'd) Renown of pow'r, like that of beauty fly From knowledge, rather then be known decay'd! 67 This when with rev'rence heard, it would have made Old Armies melt, to mark at what a rate They spent their Hearts and Eies, kindly afraid To be omitted in their Gen'ral's fate. 68 Hubert (whose Princely qualitie more frees Him then the rest, from all command, unless He find it such as with his will agrees) Did nobly thus his firm resolve express. 69 All greatness bred in blood be now abas'd! Instinct, the inward Image, which is wrought And given with Life, be like thaw'd wax defac'd! Though that bred better honor then is taught; 70 And may impressions of the common ill Which from street Parents the most low derives; Blot all my minds fair book if I stand still Whilst Oswald singly for the Publick strives: 71 A Brothers love all that obedience stays, Which Oswald else might as my Leader claime; Whom as my love, my honour disobays, And bids me serve our greater Leader, Fame. 72 With gentle looks Oswald to Hubert bowes, And said, I then must yield that Hubert shall (Since from the same bright Sun our lustre grows) Rise with my Morne, and with my Ev'ning fall! 73 Bold Paradine and Dargonet reviv'd Their Suit, and cry'd, we are Astolpho's sons! Who from your highest spring his blood deriv'd, Though now it down in lower Channels runs. 74 Such lucky seasons to attain renown, We must not lose, who are to you ally'd; Others usurp, who would your dangers own, And what our duty is, in them is pride. 75 Then as his last Decree thus Oswald spake; You that vouchsafe to glory in my blood, Shall share my dooms which for your merits sake, Fate, were it bad, would alter into good. 76 If any others disobedient rage, Shall with uncivil love intrude his aid, And by degrees our distant Troops ingage, Be it his Curse still to be disobay'd! 77 War's Orders may he by the slow convay To such as only shall dispute them long; An ill peace make, when none will him obay, And be for that, when old, judg'd by the young. 78 This said, he calmly bid the Duke provide Such of his blood, as with those chosen Three (Whilst their adoption they on foot decide) May in brave life or death fit Partners bee. 79 Though here (reply'd the Duke) I find not now. Such as my blood with their alliance grace, Yet Three I see, to whom your stock may bow, If Love may be esteem'd of Heav'nly Race. 80 And much to me these are by love ally'd; Then Hugo, Arnold, and the Count drew neere; Count Hurgonill woo'd Orna for his Bride, The other two in Laura Rivals were. 81 But Tybalt cry'd (as swiftly as his voice Approach'd the Duke) forgive me mighty Chief, If justly I envy thy noble choice, And disobey thee in wrong'd Love's relief. 82 If rev'renc'd love be sacred Myst'ry deem'd, And mystery's when hid to value grow, Why am I less for hidden love esteem'd? To unknown Godhead, wise Religious bow. 83 A Maid of thy high linage much I love, And hide her name till I can merit boast, But shall I here (where I my worth improve) For prising her above my self, be lost? 84 The Duke's firm bosome kindly seem'd to melt At Tybalt's grief, that he omitted was; Who lately had Love's secret conquest felt, And hop'd for publick triumph in this cause. 85 Then he decreed, Hugo (though chose before To share in this great work) should equally With Tybalt be expos'd to Fortune's pow'r, And by drawn Lots their wish'd election try. 86 Hugo his dreaded Lord with chearfull awe Us'd to obey, and with implicit love; But now he must for certain honor draw Uncertain Lots, seems heavily to move. 87 And here they trembling reach'd at Honor so, As if they gath'ring Flow'rs a Snake discern'd; Yet fear'd Love only whose rewards then grow To Lovers sweetest, when with danger earn'd. 88 From this brave fear, least they should danger scape, Was little Hugo eas'd, and when he drew The Champion's lot, his joy inlarg'd his shape, And with his lifted minde he taller grew. 89 But Tybalt stoop'd beneath his sorrows weight; Goltho and him kindly the Duke imbrac'd; Then to their station sent; and Oswald straight His so injoyn'd, and with like kindness grac'd. 90 When cruel Borgio does from Tybalt part, Vasco from Goltho, many a look they cast Backward in sullen message from the heart, And through their eyes their threatning anger wast. Canto the Fourth. The ARGUMENT. The Duel where all rules of artful strife, To rescue or indanger Darling-life, Are by reserves of strength and courage shown; For killing was long since a Science grown. Th' event by which the Troops ingaged are, As private rage too often turns to warr. 1 By what bold passion am I rudely led, Like Fame's too curious and officious Spie, Where I these Rolls in her dark Closet read, Where Worthies wrapp'd in Time's disguises lie? 2 Why should we now their shady Curtains draw, Who by a wise retirement hence are freed, And gon to Lands exempt from Nature's Law, Where Love no more can mourn, nor valor bleed? 3 Why to this stormy world from their long rest, Are these recall'd to be again displeas'd, Where during Nature's reign we are opprest, Till we by Death's high priviledge are eas'd? 4 Is it to boast that Verse has Chymick pow'r, And that its rage (which is productive heat) Can these revive, as Chymists raise a Flow'r, Whose scatter'd parts their Glass presents compleat? 5 Though in these Worthies gon, valor and love Dist chastly as in sacred Temples meet, Such reviv'd Patterns us no more improve, Then Flow'rs so rais'd by Chymists make us sweet, 6 Yet when the souls disease we desp'rate finde, Poets the old renown'd Physitians are, Who for the sickly habits of the mind, Examples as the ancient cure prepare. 7 And bravely then Physitians honor gain, When to the World diseases cureless seem, And they (in Science valiant) ne'r refrain Art's war with Nature, till they life redeem. 8 But Poets their accustom'd task have long Forborn, (who for Examples did disperse The Heroes vertues in Heroick Song) And now think vertue sick, past cure of verse. 9 Yet to this desp'rate cure I will proceed, Such patterns shew as shall not fail to move; Shall teach the valiant patience when they bleed, And hapless Lovers constancy in Love. 10 Now Honor's chance, the Duke with Oswald takes, The Count his great Stake, Life, to Hubert sets; Whilst his to Paradin's, Lord Arnold stakes, And little Hugo throwes at Dargonets. 11 These Four on equall ground those Four oppose; Who wants in strength, supplies it with his skill; So valiant that they make no haste to close; They not apace, but handsomly would kill. 12 And as they more each others courage found, Each did their force more civilly express, To make so manly and so fair a wound, As loyal Ladies might be proud to dress. 13 But vain, though wond'rous, seems the short event Of what with pomp and Noise we long prepare: One hour of battail oft that force hath spent Which Kings whole lives have gather'd for a war. 14 As Rivers to their ruine hasty be, So life (still earnest, loud, and swift) runs post To the vast Gulf of Death, as they to Sea, And vainly travailes to be quickly lost. 15 And now the Fates (who punctually take care We not escape their sentence at our birth) Writ Arnold down where those inroled are Who must in Youth abruptly leave the Earth. 16 Him Paradine into the Brow had pierc't; From whence his blood so overflow'd his Eyes, He grew too blinde to watch and guard his brest, Where wounded twice, to Death's cold Court he flies. 17 And Love (by which Life's name does value find, As Altars even subsist by ornament) Is now as to the Owner quite resign'd, And in a sigh to his dear Laura sent. 18 Yet Fates so civil were in cruelty As not to yield that he who conquer'd all The Tuscan Vale, should unattended dy, They therefore doom that Dargonet must fall. 19 Whom little Hugo dext'rously did vex VVith many wounds in unexpected place, VVhich yet not kill, but killingly perplex; Because he held their number a disgrace. 20 For Dargonet in force did much exceed The most of men, in valor equall'd all; And was asham'd thus diversly to bleed, As if he stood where showers of Arrows fall. 21 At once he ventures his remaining strength To Hugo's nimble skill, who did desire To draw this little war out into length, By motions quick as Heav'n's fantastick fire! 22 This fury now is grown too high to last In Dargonet; who does disorder all The strengths of temp'rance by unruly haste, Then down at Hugo's feet does breathless fall. 23 When with his own Storm sunk, his Foe did spie Lord Arnold dead, and Paradine prepare To help Prince Oswald to that victory, Of which the Duke had yet an equal share. 24 Vain Conqueror (said Hugo then) returne! In stead of Laurel which the Victor weares, Go gather Cypress for thy Brother's Urne, And learn of me to water it with Tears. 25 Thy Brother lost his life attempting mine; Which cannot for Lord Arnold's loss suffice: I must revenge (unlucky Paradine) The blood his death will draw from Laura's Eyes. 26 We Rivals were in Laura, but though she My griefs derided, his with sighs approv'd; Yet I (in Love's exact integrity) Must take thy life for killing him She lov'd. 27 These quick alike, and artfully as fierce, At one sad instant give and take that wound, Which does through both their vital Closets pierce; Where Life's small Lord does warmly sit enthron'd. 28 And then they fell, and now neer upper Heaven, Heav'ns better part of them is hov'ring still, To watch what end is to their Princes given, And to brave Hubert, and to Hurgonil. 29 In progress thus to their eternal home, Some method is observ'd by Destiny, Which at their Princes setting out did doom, These as their leading Harbingers to die. 30 And fatal Hubert we must next attend, Whom Hurgonil had brought to such distress, That though Life's stock he did not fully spend, His glory that maintain'd it is grown less. 31 Long had they strove, who first should be destroy'd; And wounds (the Marks of Manhood) gave and took, Which though like honor'd Age, we would avoid, Yet make us when possess'd for rev'rence look. 32 O Honor! Frail as Life thy Fellow Flower! Cherish'd and watch'd, and hum'rously esteem'd, Then worn for short adornments of an hour; And is when lost no more then life redeem'd. 33 This fatall Hubert findes, if honor be As much in Princes lost, when it grows less, As when it dies in men of next degree: Princes are only Princes by excess. 34 For having twice with his firm Opposite Exchang'd a wound, yet none that reach'd at life, The adverse sword his Arms best sinew hit, Which holds that strength, which should maintain their strife. 35 When thus his dear defence had left his Hand, Thy life (said Hurgonil) rejoyce to wear As Orna's favour, and at her command, Who taught the mercy I will practise here. 36 To which defenceless Hubert did reply, My life (a worthless Blank) I so despise, Since Fortune laid it in her Lotary, That I'me asham'd thou draw'st it as a Prise. 37 His grief made noble Hurgonill to melt, Who mourn'd in this a Warrior's various fate; For though a Victor now, he timely felt That change which pains us most by coming late. 38 But Orna (ever present in his thought) Prompts him to know, with what success for fame And Empire, Gondibert and Oswald fought; Whilst Hubert seeks out death, and shrinks from shame. 39 Valor, and all that practise turns to art, A like the Princes had and understood; For Oswald now is cool as Gondibert; Such temper he has got by losing blood. 40 Calmly their temper did their art obey; Their stretch'd Arms regular in motion prove; And force with as unseen a stealth convey, As noyseless Houres by hands of Dials move. 41 By this new temper Hurgonill believ'd That Oswald's elder vertues might prevail; To think his own help needful much he griev'd; But yet prepar'd it lest the Duke should fail. 42 Small wounds they had, where as in Casements sate Disorder'd Life; who seem'd to look about, And fain would be abroad, but that a Gate She wants so wide, at once to sally out. 43 When Gondibert saw Hurgonill draw near, And doubly arm'd at conquer'd Hubert's cost, He then, who never fear'd, began to fear Lest by his help his honor should be lost, 44 Retire said he; for if thou hop st to win My sisters love, by aiding in this strife; May Heav'n (to make her think they love a sin) Eclipse that beauty which did give it life. 45 Count Hurgonill did doubtfully retire, Fain would assist, yet durst not disobey; The Duke would rather instantly expire, Then hazard Honor by so mean a way. 46 Alike did Oswald for dispatch prepare; And cries since Hubert knew not to subdue; Glory farewell, that art the Soldiers care! More lov'd then Woman, less then Woman true! 47 And now they strive with all their sudden force To storm Life's Cittadel, each others Brest; At which could Heav'ns chief Eye have felt remorse, It would have wink'd, or hast'ned to the West. 48 But sure the Heav'nly Movers little care Whither our motion here be false or true; For we proceed, whilst they are regular, As if we Dice for all our actions threw. 49 We seem surrender'd to indiff'rent Chance; Even Death's great work looks like fantastick play; That Sword which oft did Oswald's fame advance In publick war, fails in a private fray. 50 For when (because he ebbs of blood did feel) He levell'd all his strength at Gondibert, It clash'd and broke against the adverse steel, Which travell'd onward till it reach'd his heart. 51 Now he that like a stedfast statue stood In many Battails register'd by Fame; Does fall depriv'd of language as of blood; Whilst high the Hunters send their Victor's name. 52 Some shout aloud, and others winde the Horn! They mix the Cities with the Field's applause; Which Borgio soon interprets as their scorn, And will revenge it ere he mourn the cause. 53 This the cold Evening warm'd of Vasco's age; He shin'd like scorching Noon in Borgio's looks; Who kindled all about him with his rage; And worse the triumph then the Conquest Brooks. 54 The Troops (astonish'd with their Leaders fate) The horror first with silence entertain; With loud impatience then for Borgio waite, And next with one confusion all complain. 55 Whom thus he urg'd! Prince Oswald did command We should remove far from the Combat's list; And there like unconcern'd Spectators stand; Justly restrain'd to hinder or assist. 56 This (Patient Friends!) we dully have obey'd; A temp rance which he never taught before; But though alive he could forbid our aid, Yet dead, he leaves revenge within our pow'r. Canto the Fifth. The ARGUMENT. The Battail in exact though little shape; Where none by flight, and few by fortune scape; Where even the vanquish'd so themselves behave, The Victors mourn for all they could not save: And fear (so soon is Fortune's fulness wayn'd) To lose in one, all that by all they gain'd. 1 Now Hubert's Page assists his wounded Lord To mount that Steed, he scarce had force to guide; And wept to see his hand without that sword Which was so oft in dreadfull Battails try'd. 2 Those who with Borgio saw his want of blood, Cry'd out, If of thy strength enough remain, Though not to charge, to make thy conduct good; Lead us to add their living to our slain. 3 Hubert reply'd, now you may justly boast You Sons of war, that Oswald was your Sire; Who got in you the honor I have lost; And taught those deeds our Ladies songs admire. 4 But he (war's Ancestor, who gave it birth The Father of those fights we Lombards fought) Lies there imbracing but his length of Earth, Who for your use the world's vast Empire sought, 5 And cold as he lies noble Dargonet, And Paradine, who wore the Victors Crown; Both swift to charge, and slow in a retreat; Brothers in blood, and Rivals in renown. 6 This said, their Trumpets sound Revenge's praise; The Hunters Horns (the terror of the wood) Reply'd so meanly, they could scarcely raise Eccho so loud as might be understood. 7 The Duke (his fit of fury being spent, Which onely wounds and opposition bred) Does weep o'er the brave Oswald, and lament That he so great in life, is nothing dead. 8 But cry'd, when he the speechless Rivals spy'd, O worth above the ancient price of Love! Lost are the living, for with these love dy'd; Or if immortal fled with them above. 9 In these we the intrinsick vallue know By which first Lovers did love currant deem; But Love's false Coyners will allay it now, Till men suspect what next they must contemn. 10 Not less young Hurgonil resents their chance, Though no fit time to practice his remorse, For now he cries (finding the Foe advance) Let Death give way to life! to horse! to horse! 11 This sorrow is too soft for deeds behinde; Which I (a mortal Lover) would sustain, So I could make your sister wisely kinde, And praise me living, not lament me slain. 12 Swift as Armenians in the Panthers chace They fly to reach where now their Hunters are; Who sought out danger with too bold apace, Till thus the Duke did them alow'd prepare. 13 Impatient Friends, stand that your strength may last! Burn not in blaze, rage that should warm you long! I wish to Foes the weaknesses of haste, To you such slowness as may keep you strong. 14 Not their scorns force should your fix'd patience move; Though scorn does more then bonds free mindes provoke Their flashy rage shall harmless lightning prove, Which but fore-runs our Thunder's fatal stroke. 15 For when their fury's spent, how weak they are With the dull weight of antick Vandall Arms? Their work but short, and little is in war, Whom rage within, and Armor outward warms. 16 When you have us'd those arts your patience yields, Try to avoid their cowched Launces force By dext'rous practice of Croatian Fields, Which turns to lazy Elephants their Horse. 17 When false retreat shall scatter you in flight, As if you back to Elements were fled; And no less faith can you again unite, Then recollects from Elements the dead, 18 Make Chacers seem by your swift Rallys, slow; Whilst they your swifter change of figures fear, Like that in Batails which t'amuse the Foe My Grandsire taught, as war's Philosopher. 19 Think now your valor enters on the Stage, Think Fame th'Eternal Chorus to declare Your mighty mindes to each succeeding age, And that your Ladyes the Spectators are. 20 This utter'd was with such a haughty grace, That ev'ry heart it empty'd, and did raise Life's chiefest blood in valor to the Face, Which made such beauty as the Foe did praise. 21 Yet 'twas Ambition's praise, which but approves Those whom through envy it would fain subdue; Likes others honor, but her own so loves, She thinks all others Trophys are her due. 22 For Hubert now (though void of strength as feare) Advanc'd the first Division fast and farre; Bold Borgio with the next attends his Reare, The Third was left to Vasco's stedy care. 23 The Duke still watch'd when each Divisions space Grew wide, that he might his more open spred; His own brave conduct did the foremost grace, The next the Count, the Third true Tybalt led. 24 A forward fashion he did wear awhile, As if the Charge he would with fury meet; That he their forward fury might beguile, And urge them past redemption by retreat. 25 But when with Launces cowch'd they ready were, And their thick Front (which added Files inlarge) With their ply'd spurs kept time in a Carere, Those soon were vanished whom they meant to charge. 26 The Duke by flight, his Manhood thus and force Reserv'd, and to his skill made valor yield, Did seem to blush, that he must lead his Horse To lose a little ground to gain the Field. 27 Yet soon he ralleys and revives the warre; Hubert pursues the Rear of Hurgonil; And Borgio's Rear with Chace so loos'ned are, That them the Count does with close order kill. 28 And that which was erewhile the Duke's firm Van, Before old Vasco's Front vouchsafe to fly, Till with their subtle Rallys they began In small Divisions hidden strength to try; 29 Then cursing Borgio cry'd, whence comes his skill, Who men so scatter'd can so firmly mix? The living Metal, held so violatile By the dull world, this Chymick Lord can fix! 30 He press'd where Hurgonill his fury spends, As if he now in Orna's presence fought; And with respect his brave approach attends, To give him all the dangers which he sought. 31 So bloody was th'event of this new strife, That we may here applauded valor blame; Which oft too easily abandons Life, Whilst Death's the Parent made of noble Fame. 32 For many now (belov'd by both) forsake In their pursuit of flying Fame, their breath; And through the world their valor currant make, By giving it the ancient stamp of Death. 33 Young Hurgonil's renowned self had bought Honor of Borgio at no less a rate, Had not the Duke dispatch'd with those he fought, And found his aid must fly or come too late. 34 For he advancing saw (which him much griev'd) That in the fairest Region of the Face, He two wide wounds from Borgio had receiv'd; His beautyes blemish, but his valor's grace. 35 Now cry'd the Duke, strive timely for renown! Thy Age will kiss those wounds thy youth may loath; Be not dismay'd to think thy beauty gone; My Sister's thine, who has enough for both. 36 Then soon the Youth, Death as an honor gave To one that Strove to rescue Borgio's life; Yet Borgio had dispatch'd him to his grave, Had Gondibert stood neutral in the Strife: 37 Who with his Sword (disdaining now to stay And see the blood he lov'd so rudely spilt) Pierc't a bold Lombard who would stop his way; Even till his heart did beat against his Hilt. 38 Timely old Vasco came to Borgio's aid; Whose long experienc'd Arme wrought sure and faste; His rising oppositions level laid, And miss'd no execution by his haste. 39 And timely where the bleeding Count now fought, And where the Duke with Number was opprest, Resistless Tybalt came, who Borgio sought, But here with many Borgio's did contest. 40 As Tydes that from their sev'ral Channels haste, Assemble rudely in th'Ubæan Bay, And meeting there to indistinction waste, Strive to proceed, and force each others stay: 41 So here the valiant who with swift force come, With as resistless valor are ingag'd; Are hid in anger's undistinguish'd Fome, And make less way by meeting so inrag'd! 42 But room for Goltho now! Whose valor's fire, Like light'ning, did unlikely passage make; Whose swift effects like Light'nings they admire, And even the harms it wrought with rever'nce take. 43 Vasco he seeks, who had his Youth disdain'd; And in that search he with irrever'nd rage, Revengefully, from younger Foes abstain'd, And deadly grew where he encounter'd Age. 44 And Vasco now had felt his Gothick steel, But that Duke Gondibert (through Helm and Head) Gave the last stroke which Vasco ere shall feel, And sent him down an honour to the dead. 45 Here Borgio too had faln, but bravely then The Count so much reveng'd the wounds he gave, As Gondibert (the Prop of falling Men) Such sinking greatness could not chuse but save. 46 When Vasco was remov'd, the Count declin'd His bashful Eies; the Duke thought sodain shame (From sense of luckless wounds) possess'd his mind; Which thus he did reform, and gently blame. 47 Now thy complexion lasting is, and good! As when the Sun sets red, his Morning Eies In glory wake, so now thou setst in blood, Thy parting beauty will in honor rise. 48 These scarrs thou need'st not from my Sister hide; For as our Father, in brave batail lost, She first did name with sorrow, then with pride, Thy beauty's loss she'l mourn and after boast. 49 Mine are but Lov's false wounds (said Hurgonil) To what you Vasco gave; for I must grieve My strength of honor could not Vasco kill, That honor lost, yet I have strength to live. 50 But now behold vex'd Hubert, who in all This Batail was by ready conduct known, And though unarm'd, and his spent force so small He could to none bring death, yet sought his own: 51 And ev'ry where, where Rallies made a Grosse He charg'd; and now with last reserves he try'd His too slow fate from Gondibert to force, Where he was Victor and where Vasco dy'd. 52 The Duke (in Honor's School exactly bred) Would not that this defenceless Prince should be Involv'd with those, whom he to dying led, Therefore ordain'd him still from slaughter free. 53 And now his pow'r did gently make him know, That he must keep his life, and quit the cause; More Pris'ner to himself then to his Foe, For life within himself in Prison was. 54 His fierce Assistants did not quit the Field, Till forward marks declar'd they fairly fought; And then they all with sullen slowness yield; Vex'd they have found what vain Revenge had sought. 55 In the renown'd destruction of this day, Four Hundred Leaders were by valor's pride Led to blest shades, by an uncertain way, Where lowliness is held the surest Guide. 56 And twice the Tierce of these consists of those Who for Prince Oswald's love of Empire bled; The Duke does thus with thanks and praise dispose Both of the worthy living, and the dead. 57 Binde all your wounds, and shed not that brave life, Which did in all by great demeanor past, (Teaching your Foes a wiser choice of strife) Deserve a Lease of Nature that may last. 58 Love warm'd you with those sparks which kindled me; And form'd Idea's in each Lovers thought Of the distress of some beloved she, Who then inspir'd and prais'd you whilst you fought. 59 You nobly prompt my passion to desire, That the rude Crowd who Lovers softness scorn, Might in fair field meet those who love admire, To try which side must after Batail mourn. 60 O that those rights which should the good advance, And justly are to painful valor due, (Howe're misplac'd by the swift hand of Chance) Were from that Crowd defended by those few! 61 With this great spectacle we should refresh Those Chiefs, who (though preferr'd by being dead) Would kindly wish to fight again in flesh; So all that lov'd, by Hurgonil were led. 62 This gracious mention from so great a Lord, Bow'd Hurgonill with dutious homage down, Where at his feet he lay'd his rescu'd Sword; Which he accepts, but he returns his own. 63 By this and thine, said gentle Gondibert, In all distress of various Courts and warre, We interpledg and bind each others heart, To strive who shall possess griefs greatest share. 64 Now to Verona haste, and timely bring Thy wounds unto my tender sister's care, This Days sad story to our dreaded King, And watch what veng'ance Oswald's Friends prepare. 65 Brave Arnold, and his Rival strait remove; Where Laura shall bestrew their hallow'd Ground; Protectors both, and Ornaments of Love; This said, his Eies outwep'd his widest wound. 66 Tell her now these (Love's faithful Saints) are gon, The beauty they ador'd, she ought to hide; For vainly will Love's Miracles be shown, Since Lovers faith with these brave Rivals dy'd. 67 Say little Hugo never more shall mourn In noble Numbers, her unkind disdain; Who now not seeing beauty, feels no scorn; And wanting pleasure, is exempt from pain. 68 When she with Flowres Lord Arnold's Grave shall strew, And hears why Hugo's life was thrown away, She on that Rival's Hearse will drop a few; Which merits all that April gives to May. 69 Let us forsake for safety of our Eies, Our other loss; which I will strait inter And raise a Trophy where each Body lies; Vain marks, how those alive the Dead prefer! 70 If my full Breast, my wounds that empty be, And this Days toil (by which my strength is gon) Forbid me not, I Bergamo will see Ere it beholds the next succeeding Sun. 71 Thither convay thy soul's consid'rate thought, How in this cause the Court and Camp's inclin'd; What Oswald's Faction with the King has wrought, And how his loss prevails with Rhodalind. 72 The Count and Tybalt take their lowly leaves; Their slain they sadly with consuming hearts, Bear tow'rds Verona, whilst the Duke perceives Prince Hubert's grief, and thus his tears diverts. 73 Afflicted Prince! in an unpleasant how'r You and your living (by blinde valor led) Are Captives made to such an easie pow'r, Shall you as little vex, as Death your dead. 74 The Dead can n're by living help return From that darke Land, which life could ne'r disclose; But these alive (for whom the Victors mourn) To thee I give, thee to thine own dispose. 75 Be not with Honor's guilded Baites beguild; Nor think Ambition wise, because 'tis brave; For though we like it, as a forward Child, 'Tis so unsound, her Cradle is her grave. 76 Study the mighty Oswald vainly gone! Fierce Paradine, and Dargonet the stout! Whose Threds by destiny were slowly spunne, And by Ambition rashly ravell'd out. 77 But Hubert's grief no precept could reform; For great grief councell'd, does to anger grow; And he provided now a future Storm, Which did with black revenge o'recast his Brow. 78 Borgio and he from this dire Region haste; Shame makes them sightless to themselves and dumb; Their thoughts fly swift as Time from what is past; And would like him demolish all to come. 79 Strait they inter th' inferior of their slain; Their nobler Tragick load their grief attends Tow'rds Brescia, where the Camp they hope to gain; Then force the Court by faction of their Friends. 80 To Bergamo the gentle Duke does turn With his surviving Lovers, who in kinde Remembrance every step look back and mourn Their fellow Lovers Death has stay'd behinde. 81 Some lost their quiet Rivals, some their dear Love's Brother, who their hopes with help approv'd; Some such joy'd Friends, as even to morrow were To take from Hymen those they dearest lov'd. 82 But now to Gondibert they forward look, Whose wounds, ere he could waste Three Leagues of way, So wast him, that his speech him quite forsook; And Nature calls for Art to make life stay. 83 His Friends in torment least they should forsake Delightful him, for whom alone they live; Urge Heav'n uncivilly for calling back So soon such worth, it does so seldom give. Canto the Sixth. The ARGUMENT. The Victor is (when with his wounds subdu'd) By such deform'd and dismal Troops pursu'd, That he thinks Death, then which they uglier seem, No ill expedient to escape from them. But Ulfin guides him to sage Astragon, By the last Raies of the descending Sun. 1 Scarce on their Duke their fears kind fit was spent, When strait a thick arm'd Squadron clouds their sight; Which cast so dark a shade, as if it ment Without the Sun's slow leave, to bring in night. 2 This threatning Squadron did consist of Horse, And by old Ulfin they were bravely led, Whose mind was sound, nor wants his Body force, Though many Winters Snow had cool'd his Head. 3 The sad remainder who with Hubert went, Did miss his reach, when they to Brescia turn'd, And now (as if his haste destruction ment) He chac'd these who the Duke's spent valor mourn'd. 4 Whose posture being loose, their number few, His Scouts grow scornful as they forward come; He makes his Squadron halt, and neer he drew; Then asks aloud, what are you, and for whom? 5 The noble Goltho (whose great deeds to day Prevented Manhood in his early youth) Believ'd him Oswald's Friend, yet scorn'd the way To shelter life, behind abandon'd Truth. 6 For he to Ulfin boldly thus reply'd; This second Ambush findes us here in vain; We have no treasure left that we would hide, Since Gondibert is reckon'd with the slain. 7 Duke Gondibert we vouch to be our Lord, To whose high vertue's Sov'raignty we bow; Oswald sunk low, as death, beneath his Sword, Though him superior Fate will vanquish now. 8 Scarce empty Eagles stooping to their Prey, Could be more swift then Ulfin to alight, And come where Gondibert expiring lay; Now pleasing those whom he did newly fright. 9 For scarce that rev'rence which a Monarch draws, Who seldome will be seen, though often sought'; Who spends his carefull age in making Laws, To rule those lands for which in youth he fought; 10 Nor that respect which People pay those Kings, Whose peace makes rich, whom civil war made wise, Can equall this which aged Ulfin brings The gentle Duke, to whom he prostrate lies. 11 His Eyes (not us'd to tears) bathe every wound; Which he salutes as things he chiefly lov'd; And when expence of spirits he had found, To gain him air, his Mourners he remov'd. 12 Make way, said he, and give experience room; The Confident of age, though Youth's scorn'd guide; My wounds, though past, out-number yours to come, You can but hope the knowledge I have try'd. 13 His Hilts round Pommel he did then unskrew, And thence (which he from ancient Precept wore) In a small Christall he a Cordial drew, That weary life could to her walks restore. 14 This care (amazing all it does delight) His ruines, which so reverend appear, With wonder not so much surprise their sight, As a strange object now his Troops draw near. 15 In whom such death and want of limbs they finde, As each were lately call'd out of his Tombe, And left some members hastily behinde; Or came when born abortive from the Wombe. 16 Yet this defect of Legs, or Arms, or Hands, Did wondring valor not disturb; but please; To see what divers weapons each commands With arts hard shifts, till custome gave them ease. 17 But the uncomely absence of an Eye, And larger wants, which ev'ry visage mourn'd, (Where black did over-vail, or ill supply) Was that which wonder into horror turn'd. 18 And Ulfin might be thought (when the rude wind Lifting their Curtains, left their ruines bare) A formal Antiquary, fondly kind To Statues, which he now drew out to aire. 19 The Duke (whose absent knowledge was call'd back By Cordials pow'r) his wonder did increase So much, that he agen did knowledge lack, Till thus old Ulfin made his wonder cease. 20 Auspicious Prince! recorded be this day, And sung by Priests of each ensuing age; On which thou maist receive, and I may pay Some debts of duty, as thy Grandsires Page. 21 That mighty Chief I serv'd in youth's first strength, Who our short Scepter meant to stretch so far, Till Eastern Kings might grieve theirs wanted length, Whose Maps scarce teach where all their Subjects are. 22 Full many stormy Winters we have seen, When mighty valor's heat was all our fire; Else we in stupid Frosts had fetter'd been, By which soft sinews are congeal'd to wire. 23 And many scorching Summers we have felt, Where Death relieves all whom the Sword invades; And kindly thence (where we should toyling melt) Leads us to rest beneath eternal shades. 24 For aid of action he obedience taught, And silent patience for afflictions cure; He prais'd my courage when I boldly fought, But said they conquer most, that most endure. 25 The toyls of diligence as much approv'd As Valor's self, or th' Arts her practise gaines; The care of Men, more then of glory lov'd; Success rewarded, and successes paines. 26 To joyful Victors quenching water sent, Delightful wine to their lamenting slaves; For Feasts have more brave lives then famine spent, And Temp'rance more then Trench or Armor saves. 27 Valor his Mistriss, Caution was his Friend; Both to their diff'rent seasons he appli'd; The first he lov'd, on th' other did depend; The first made worth uneasie by her pride. 28 He to submiss devotion more was giv'n After a battel gain'd, then ere 'twas fought; As if it nobler were to thank high Heav'n For favours past, then bow for bounty sought. 29 And thus through smarting heat, and aking cold, Till Heav'ns perpetual Traveller, had more Then Thirty journeys through the Zodiack told, I serv'd thy Grandsire, whom I now adore. 30 For Heav'n in his too ripe and weary age, Call'd him where peacefully he rules a Star; Free'd from low Ele'ments continu'd rage, Which last like Monarchs pow'r by needful war. 31 Strait thy lamented Father did succeed To his high place, by Aribert's consent, Our Ensignes through remoter Lands to lead: Him too I follow'd till he upward went. 32 Till that black day on which the Hunns may boast Their own defeate, and we our conquest hide; For though we gain'd, and they the battel lost, Yet then thy brave victorious Father dy'd. 33 And I am stay'd unwillingly behind; Not caught with wealth, Life's most intangling snare; Though both my Masters were in giving kinde, As joyful Victors after Battel are. 34 Whilst thus this aged Leader does express His and their Story whom this bounty feeds, His Hands the Duke's worst order'd wounds undress And gently binde; then strait he thus proceeds. 35 West from those Hills till you Cremona reach, With an unmingled right I gather rent; By their great Gift who did such precepts teach In giving, as their wealth is ne'r misspent. 36 For as their plenteous pity fills my thought, So their example was not read in vain; A Thousand, who for them in battel fought, And now distress'd with Maimes, I entertain: 37 Not giving like to those, whose gifts though scant Pain them as if they gave with gowty hand; Such vex themselves, and ease not others want; But we alike enjoy, a like command. 38 Most spaciously we dwell, where we possess All sinless pleasures Nature did ordain; And who that all may have, yet will have less, Wiser then Nature, thinks her kindness vain. 39 A sad resolve, which is a wise-mans vow, From Citties noise, and Courts unpitty'd care Did so divorce me, it would scarce allow I ere should take one League of distant ayre. 40 But that Alarms from each adjacent part Which borders my abode, disturb'd my rest, With dreadful newes that gracious Gondibert By Oswald's Faction was in fight opprest. 41 Then it had given your wonder cause to last, To see the vex'd mistakes this summons wrought In all my Maim'd Domesticks, by their haste; For some tie on the Limbs which others sought. 42 Just such mistakes audatious Ethnicks say Will happen, where the Righteous busie are, Through glad and earnest hast in the last day; Whilst others slowly to their doom prepare. 43 And this had Anger, anger noise had bred, And Noise, the Enemy of useful Thought, Had them to more mistakes then blindness led, But that our awfull Camps had silence taught. 44 Silence did mem'ry, Mem'ry order make; Order to each did his mist wood restore; For some, who once were stedfast Foot, mistake, And snatch those limbs which only Horsemen wore. 45 Like swift Pursuers on Arabian Horse, These with their needfull Instruments of hold (Which give their strange adapted weapons force) I mounted strait; Five Hundred fully told. 46 These from the Lombards highly have deserv'd, In Conquests where thy Father did command; Whom they for Science and affection serv'd; And lost their Limbs to gain our Scepter Land. 47 Which yet are noble though unsightly signes, That each in active courage much abounds; And many a widow'd Mother now repines, They cannot shew the Men who gave those wounds. 48 For dearly did the Hunns for honor pay. When they deform'd them in a fatall fight; Since though they strongly struggled for the day, Yet all they got, was everlasting Night. 49 And Oswald's Friends, were they not timely gone (Though all the Faction in one Army were) Should mourn this act against their Gen'ral's son; Who was to Soldiers more then Triumph dear. 50 For these to Conquest us'd, Retreats dislike; Thy beauty want, to others Beauty's cost; VVith envious rage still at the Face they strike; And punish Youth, for what in youth they lost. 51 Thus, though the Duke's amazement be remov'd, It now returns, gladly on him to gaze, VVho feeds those Fighters whom his Father lov'd; A gratitude would Vertue's self amaze. 52 Thou art, said he (then melted whilst he spake) So ripe in what high Heav'n does dearly love, That Heav'ns remorse for Earth we should mistake, To think it will forbear thee long above. 53 As if thy sent for Soul already were Upon her Wings, so much I give thee gon; And wish thee left in some successor here, That might receive the kindness thou hast shown. 54 Old Ulfin now (but meltingly as he) T'inrich him, gives the Jewell of his sight; For strait, with Fatherly authority, He bids his son, young Ulfinor, alight! 55 Take him (said he) whose duty I release; In whom all Heav'ns rewards included are, For all my Justice in corrupted peace, And for my mercy in revengefull warr. 56 The fruit Heav'n sent me by my loyall wife, In age the gloomy Eve of endless night; Which eas'd in me the pain of latter life, And frustates death, by fresh succession's sight. 57 The Duke with passion did this Youth embrace; Then lucky Goltho he call'd forth in view; Who was this day in Fortune's special grace, For though no blood he lost, yet much he drew. 58 Him he with Ulfinor does strait unite; Bids neither strive the other to precede, Unless when danger doth them both invite, But be, even in nice Rivalship agreed. 59 Bids both their Breasts be eithers open book, Where nought is writ too hard for sudden Eyes; But thought's plain Text grows easie by a look: Study breeds doubts, where reading should suffice. 60 But these to joyn, Nature no Councel needs; Whom Sympathy, her secret Priest, does wed; Much fam'd will be their loves, and Martial Deeds; Which fill all Books that are of Lombards read. 61 With gracious Eyes, and Body lowly bent, The Duke his Fathers rev'rend Troops salutes; To Bergamo he holds his first intent; Which to oppose, old Ulfin thus disputes. 62 Thou seest (my Prince) the faint decayes of Light; How hastily the Sun's hot Steeds begin To mend their pace, as if their longing sight Had newly spy'd their usuall Western Inn. 63 Too farr is pleasant Bergamo from hence, Since day has reach'd so neer his journeys end; Dayes strength and yours are at their last expence; Do not whilst both are wasting, both misspend. 64 You and your wounded must with Nature strive, Till all (whose few houres sway to day excells Their elder Foes long reign in Camps) arrive Where Astragon the wise and wealthy dwells. 65 Rich is that Lord, and rich in Learnings wealth; Art flies his test, he all Art's test endures; Our Cities send their sick to him for health, Our Camps the wounded for their certain cures. 66 Though cautious Nature, check'd by Destiny, Has many secrets she would ne'r impart; This fam'd Philosopher is Nature's Spie, And hireless gives th' intelligence to Art. 67 The Duke with vertue (antiquated now) Did rev'rence Councel, and to Age did bend; His first Course altars, and does this allow; Then Ulfin as their Guide they all attend. 68 Soon they the Pallace reach'd of Astragon; Which had its beauty hid by envious Night; Whose Cypress Curtain drawn before the Sun Seem'd to performe the Obsequies of light. 69 Yet lights last Rayes were not intirely spent; For they discern'd their passage through a Gate, Whose height and space shew'd ancient ornament; And Ancients there in careful Office sate. 70 Who by their Weights and Measures did record Such num'rous Burthens as were thither brought From distant Regions, to their learned Lord; On which his Chymicks and Distillers wrought. 71 But now their common business they refrain, When they observe a quiet sullenness And bloody marks in such a civil Train; Which shew'd at once their worth and their distress. 72 The voice of Ulfin they with gladness knew, VVhom to this house long neighbourhood indeer'd; Approaching Torches perfected their view, And taught the way till Astragon appear'd. 73 VVho soon did Ulfin cheerfully imbrace; The visits cause by whispers he receiv'd; VVhich first he hop'd was meant him as a grace, But being known with manly silence griev'd. 74 And then with gestures full of grave respect, The Duke he to his own Apartment led; To each distinct retirements did direct, And all the wounded he ordain'd to Bed. 75 Then thin digestive food he did provide, More to enable fleeting strength to stay; To wounds well search'd he cleansing wines apply'd, And so prepar'd his rip'ning Balsoms way. 76 Balm of the Warriour's herbe, Hypericon! To Warriour's as in use, in form decreed; For through the leaves transparent wounds are shown; And rudely touch'd, the Golden Flower does bleed. 77 For sleep they juice of pale Nymphæa took, Which grows (to shew that it for sleep is good) Near sleep's abode in the soft murm'ring Brook: This cools, the yellow Flower restraines the Blood: 78 And now the weary World's great Med'cin, Sleep, This learned Host dispenc'd to ev'ry Guest; Which shuts those wounds where injur'd Lovers weep, And flies Oppressors to relieve th' Opprest. 79 It loves the Cotage, and from Court abstains, It stills the Sea-man though the storm be high; Frees the griev'd Captive in his closest Chaines, Stops wants loud Mouth, and blinds the treach'rous Spie! 80 Kind Sleep, Nights welcome Officer, does cease All whom this House containes till day return; And me, Grief's Chronicler, does gently ease, Who have behind so great a task to mourn. The End of the First Book. THE SECOND BOOK. Canto the First. The ARGUMENT. Verona by the Poet's Pencil drawn; Where Hurgonil did meet the early dawn: Her wealth shown by each Dwellers early'r care; Which sown by others peace, she reap'd by warr. The slain, whose life her safety was and pride, Are now in death their Fun'ral Rites deny'd. 1 Neer to his Evening Region was the Sun, When Hurgonil with his lamented Load, And faithful Tybalt their sad march begun To Fair Verona, where the Court aboad. 2 They slowly rode till Night's dominion ceast; When Infant Morn (her scarce wak'd beames display'd) With a scant face peep'd shylie through the East, And seem'd as yet of the black world afraid. 3 But by increase of swift expansive light, The lost Horizon was apparent grown, And many Tow'rs salute at once their sight; The distant glories of a Royal Town. 4 Verona, sprung from noble Vera's name; Whom careless Time (still scatt'ring old Records Where they are loosly gather'd up by Fame) Proclaimes the chief of ancient Tuscan Lords. 5 Verona borders on that fatal Plaine, VVhose barren thirst was quench'd with valiant blood, When the rough Cymbrians by fierce Marius slain, Left Hills of Bodies where their Ensignes stood. 6 So safely proud this Town did now appear; As if it but immortal Dwellers lack'd; As if Theodorick had ne'r been there, Nor Attila her wealth and beauty sack'd. 7 Here Hurgonill might follow with his Eye (As with deep streame it through the City pass't) The fruitfull and the frighted Adice, Which thence from Noise and Nets to sea does haste. 8 And on her peopled Bank they might behold The Toyles of conquest paid with workes of pride; The Pallace of King Agilulf the old, Or Monument, for ere 'twas built he dy'd. 9 To it that Temple joynes, whose lofty Head The prospect of a swelling Hill commands; In whose coole wombe the City springs are bred: On Dorique Pillers this tall Temple stands. 10 This to sooth Heav'n the bloody Clephes built; As if Heav'ns King so soft and easie were, So meanly hous'd in Heav'n, and kind to guilt, That he would be a Tyrants Tenant here. 11 And now they might arrest their wandring sight With that which makes all other Objects lost; Makes Lombard greatness flat to Roman height, And Modern Builders blush, that else would boast; 12 An Amphytheater which was controll'd Unheeded conquests of advancing Age, Windes which have made the trembling World look old, And the fierce Tempests of the Gothick rage. 13 This great Flaminius did in youth erect, Where Cities sat to see whole Armies play Death's serious part: but this we may neglect To mark the bus'ness which begins with day. 14 As Day new op'ning fills the Hemisphear, And all at once; so quickly ev'ry street Does by an instant op'ning full appear, When from their Dwellings busy Dwellers meet. 15 From wider Gates Oppressors sally there; Here creeps th' afflicted through a narrow Dore; Groans under wrongs he has not strength to bear, Yet seeks for wealth to injure others more. 16 And here the early Lawyer mends his pace; For whom the earlier Cliant waited long; Here greedy Creditors their Debtors chace, Who scape by herding in th' indebted Throng. 17 Th' advent'rous Merchant whom a Storm did wake, (His Ships on Adriatick Billowes tost) Does hope of Eastern windes from Steeples take, And hastens there a Currier to the Coast. 18 Here through a secret Posterne issues out The skar'd Adult'rer, who out-slept his time; Day, and the Husbands Spie alike does doubt, And with a half hid face would hide his crime. 19 There from sick mirth neglected Feasters reel, Who cares of want in Wine's false Lethe steep. There anxious empty Gamsters homeward steal, And fear to wake, ere they begin to sleep. 20 Here stooping Lab'rers slowly moving are; Beasts to the Rich, whose strength grows rude with ease; And would usurp, did not their Rulers care, With toile and tax their furious strength appease. 21 There th' Aged walk, whose needless carefulness Infects them past the Mindes best Med'cin, sleep; There some to Temples early vows address, And for th' ore busie world most wisely weep. 22 To this vast Inn, where Tydes of strangers flow, The Morn and Hurgonil together came; The Morn, whose Dewy wings appear'd but slow, When Men the motion mark'd of swifter Fame. 23 For Fame (whose journeys are through wayes unknown, Traceless and swift and changing as the Winde) The Morne and Hurgonil had much out-gone, Whilst Truth mov'd patiently within behinde. 24 For some the Combat (to a Battel grown) Did apprehend in such prodigious shape, As if their living to the Dead were gone, And only Fame did by her Wings escape. 25 Some said this hunting falsely was design'd, That by pretence both Factions might prepare Their Armies to contest for Rhodalind; The Crown's chief Jewel, and Reward of Warre, 26 And some report (so farr they range from Truth Who for intelligence must follow Fame) That then from Bergamo th'incamped Youth, With Gondibert, to this dire hunting came. 27 And some, that Oswald had inlarg'd his Traine With the old Troopes by his bold Father led; And that of these the nobler half were slain; The rest were to their Camp at Brescia fled. 28 And as dire Thunder rowling o're Heaven's vault, By murmur threatens, ere it kills alloud; So was this fatall newes in whisper brought, Which menac'd ere it struck the list'ning Croud. 29 But Rumor soon to high extreames does move; For first it Oswald nam'd with dreadful voice, Then said that Death had widowd Truth and Love, By making Gondibert the second choice. 30 And to all hearts so dear was Gondibert, So much did Pity, Oswald's Valor prise, That strait their early bus'ness they desert, And fix on wounded Hurgonil their Eyes. 31 Him when by perfect day they sadly knew, Through hidden wounds, whose blood his beauty stain'd, Even from the Temples, Angels soon withdrew; So sawcely th' afflicted there complain'd. 32 The People strait united clamor gave, Shriek'd loud like Sea-men split on a strange Coast; As if those Pow'rs were deaf who should them save, And Pray'rs no louder then the windes were lost. 33 Now, with impatience urg'd, he does declare Whom he so mournfully in Fun'ral brought; The publick losses of a private Warr, Who living, love, and dying, valor taught. 34 For he does Hugo and Arnoldo name; To these (said he) Verona Cradles gave, And since in forraign Fields they rais'd her Fame, They challenge here, though much too soon, a Grave: 35 Bring sprinklings, Lamps, and th' Altar's precious breath; All Rites which Priests have prudently devis'd; Who gratefully a rev'rence teach to death; Because they most by dying men are pris'd. 36 But though our loss we justly may complain; Though even by Priests Authority we grieve; Yet Heav'n's first bounty, Life, let none disdain, Since Gondibert, our chief Delight, does live. 37 This heard, as Sea-men near a Shore unknown, Who their North Guide lose in a Stormy night, His absence with distracted silence moan, And loudly wellcome his return to sight: 38 So when their great Conductor seem'd to be Retir'd to endless shades amongst the slain, With silent grief they seem'd as dead as he, But with new life wellcom'd his life again. 39 And now that cold remainder Valor left Of these whom Love had lost, and Fate forsook; The Two that were of all but Fame bereft, From Hurgonil the weeping People took. 40 Whilst of them both sad Hurgonil takes leave, Till th' universal meeting Faith provides The Day when all shall publickly receive Those Bodies, Death does not destroy, but Hides. 41 Then to his Palace he retires by stealth; His wounds from his lov'd Mistris to conceal; On whose dear joys so much depends his health, The wounds her Tears should touch would never heal. 42 To the chief Temple strait the People bear The valiant Rivals, who for love were slain; Whom all the peacefull Priests behold with fear, And griev'd such Guests they durst not entertain. 43 For soon the Prior of their Brotherhood (Who long serv'd Heav'n with praise, the world with prayer) Cry'd out, this holy House is shut to blood, To all that die in combat or dispair. 44 These by their bloody marks in Combat di'd; Through anger, the disease of Beasts untam'd; Whose wrath is hunger, but in Men 'tis pride, Yet theirs is cruelty, ours courage nam'd. 45 Here the neglected Lord of peace does live; Who taught the wrangling world the rules of love; Should we his dwelling to the wrathfull give, Our Sainted Dead would rise, and he remove. 46 Well by his precepts may we punish strife; Whose pity knew that Famine, Plague, and Time, Are Enemies enough to humane life; None need o'er-charge Death's Quiver with a crime. 47 To unfrequented Fields bear then your slain; Where neither Dirge nor Requiem shall be giv'n; To those who by usurp'd Revenge disdain To take from Men, neglects they put on Heav'n. 48 But now the People's passions run too farr; Their untaught love, artless extremes does wed; Of times they like the past, and since they are Opprest still by the living, love the Dead: 49 And now resolve these Rivals shall not lose The Rites of Sprinkling, Incense, Lights, and Song: Then, as the voice of all their Minds, they chuse An Orator, of rude, but ready Tongue: 50 Who at the Temple Gate thus pleads aloud! VVe know, though Priests are Pensioners of Heav'n, Your Flock which yields best rent, is this dull Croud; The learn'd examine why their Fleece is giv'n. 51 Though by the Rich first shorn, to you they bear A second tribute, and by zeal support Temples, which Kings for glory raise, and where The Rich for fame, the Learn'd as Spies resort. 52 Temples are yours, not God's lov'd Palaces; Where Off'rings make not his, but your own Feasts; Where you most wisely live, because at ease, And entertain your Founders as your Guests: 53 With ease you take, what we provide with care; And we (who your Legation must maintain) Find all your Tribe in the Commission are; And none but Heav'n could send so large a Train. 54 But being all Ambassadors from thence, The growing charge will soon exceed our rent, Unless you please to treat at his expence VVho sent you; not at ours, where you are sent. 55 The ancient Laws liv'd in the Peoples voice; Rites you from Custom, not from Canon draw; They are but fashions of a graver choice, VVhich yield to Laws, and now our voice is Law. 56 This Tybalt heard with sorrow and disdain, (VVho here with Hurgonil a Mourner came) And strait the peaceful Fathers strives to gain, And thus the Peoples Orator reclaim. 57 Most usefull Fathers! some trace secret things Even to his Closet, who is hid in Heav'n; Vainly as Nilus to his hidden springs, And not enjoy, but censure what is given. 58 You with such temper their intemp'rance bear, To shew your solid science does rely So on it self, as you no trial feare; For Arts are weak that are of Scepticks shy. 59 Though in your Office humane safety lies, Which op'ns that Hell the vicious vulgar feare, Yet never can the People Priesthood prise; As if from Heav'n your daily errands were. 60 Not that your message, Truth, they disesteem, Or think it comes from any other way, But that they Taxes hate, and Truth does seem Brought as a Tax, when they the Bringers pay. 61 Thus we to Beasts fall from our noble kinde, Making our Pastur'd Bodies all our care; Allowing no subsistence to the Minde; For Truth we grudg her as a costly fare. 62 But if they fear (since daily you renew Disputes) your Oracles are doubtfull still As those of old; yet more reward is due To paines, where so uneasie is the skill. 63 Or if no skill they think it, but suppose 'Tis Faith (and Faith ne'r thinks Heav'n's height too high) Yet Faiths so sev'ral be, that few are those Can chuse right wings when they to Heav'n would fly. 64 Or if they think, Faith humane help transcends, And to your science is so strict a bound As Death to Valor is where daring ends; And none are farthest in that Progress found; 65 Yet in our walk to our last home design'd, 'Tis safe by all the study'd Guides to goe; Least we in death, too late, the knowledge find Of what in life 'twas possible to know. 66 Your splendid Pomp, by which your Pow'r indures Though costly, costs much less then Camps or Laws; And more then both, Religion us secures; Since Hell (your Prison) more then dying awes. 67 For though the plain Judge, Conscience, makes no showe, But silently to her dark Session comes, Not as red Law does to arraignment goe, Or Warr to Execution with loud Drums; 68 Though she on Hills sets not her Gibbets high, Where frightful Law sets hers; nor bloody seems Like Warr in Colours spread, yet secretly She does her work, and many Men condemns. 69 Chokes in the seed, what Law till ripe ne'r sees; What Law would punish, Conscience can prevent; And so the world from many Mischiefs frees; Known by her Cures, as Law by punishment. 70 The weaker sighted ever look too nigh; But their disputes have made your Charter good; As doubted Tenures, which long pleadings trie, Authentick grow by being much withstood. 71 These Chiefs, for whom we holy Rites desire, By well fought Fields begot this Citties peace; Oft with their blood have quench'd intestine fire; And oft our Famines chang'd into excess. 72 Their Rites let not the people be deny'd, Though by untutor'd kindness rudely sought; Nor think they have in private Combate dyde, Where Gondibert and mighty Oswald fought; 73 Both Princes of the Lombards royal blood; For whom full Thrice Three Hunder'd number'd are, Whose anger strove to make their anger good: Number gives strife th' authentick name of War. 74 This said, Warrs cause these Priests no more debate; They knew, Warr's Justice none could ere decide; At that more specious name they open strait, And sacred Rites of fun'ral they provide. 75 How vain is Custom, and how guilty Pow'r? Slaughter is lawful made by the excess; Earth's partial Laws, just Heav'n must needs abhor, Which greater crimes allow, and damn the less. Canto the Second. The ARGUMENT. Fame's progress through Verona, when she brings Ill news inlarg'd, as her extended wings. The Combat's cause shakes Aribert's great mind; And the effect more conquers Rhodalind. Meek Orna's fears, proud Gartha's bold disdain; And Laura kindly dying for the Slain. 1 To Streets (the People's Region) early Fame First brought this grief, which all more tragick make; And next, to the triumphant Court she came, Where prosp'rous Pow'r sleeps long, though Sutors wake; 2 But yet the early King (from Childhood bred To dangers, toyls, and courser wants of ware) Rose up to rule, and left soft Love in bed, Could conquer Lands and Love, but stoopt to care. 3 Care, that in Cloysters only seales her Eyes, Which Youth thinks folly, Age as wisdom owns; Fooles by not knowing her, out-live the wise; She visits Cities, but she dwells in Thrones. 4 Care, which King Aribert with Conquest gain'd, And is more sure to him then Realms intail'd; Wak'd him to know why Rumor thus complain'd, Or who in battel bled, or who prevail'd? 5 Young Hurgonil (who does his wounds conceal, Yet knew it did his dutious care import That some just witness should his cause reveal) Sent Tybalt to appease, and tast the Court. 6 To that proud Palace which once low did lie In Parian Quarries, now on Columnes stands; Ionique Props that bear their Arches high, With ample treasure rais'd by Tuscan Hands. 7 So vast of height, to which such space did fit As if it were o're-syz'd for Modern Men; The ancient Giants might inhabit it; And there walk free as windes that pass unseen. 8 The Monarch's wealth this shew'd in all the parts; But his strong numerous Guards denote him wise; Who on the weather of his Peoples hearts, For a short Course, not voyages, relies. 9 Through many Guards (all watchful, calm, and bold) Tybalt did pass the first magnifick Square; And through ascents does enter to behold, Where the States Head and Eies assembled are. 10 There sat the King, on whose consid'rate Brow Sixty experienc'd Sommers he discern'd, Which made him ripe, and all of Conduct know That from success is own'd, from losses learn'd. 11 Neer him the Empire's strict Surveyors sate; Whose universal sight no object lose; Who see not crimes too soon, nor worth too late; Finde dangers seed, and choake it ere it grows. 12 He wealth not birth preferr'd to Councels place; For Councel is for use, not ornament; Soules are alike, of rich and ancient race; Though Bodies claim distinctions by descent. 13 Here boyling Youth, nor frozen Age can sit: It would in Subjects scorne of ruling Breed, If that great work should such small ayds admit, And make them hope that they no Rulers need. 14 Nature too oft by birthright does preferr Less perfect Monarchs to an anxious Throne; Yet more then her, Courts by weak Counc'lers err, In adding Cyphers where she made but one. 15 To this wise King, sage Tybalt did relate The Combats cause, with truth's severe extent Reveales that fire which kindl'd Oswald's hate; For which such precious valor was misspent. 16 Gives Gondibert a just record of praise; First how unwilling, then how bold in sight; And crownes the Conquer'd with the Victor's Baies, When Manhood bids him do their valor right: 17 At last he counts the wounded and the slaine; And how Prince Hubert and the Duke retir'd; From nothing brave or great he did refraine, But his own deeds, which doing were admir'd. 18 This Arribert with outward patience heares, Though wounded by the cause for which they fought; With mod'rate joy the death of Oswald beares; Yet justly to extremes it inward wrought. 19 Tybalt he now with peaceful lookes discharg'd; And then his thoughts (imprison'd in his breast) He strait by liberty of Tongue inlarg'd; Which thus unto his Councel he addrest. 20 With what a difference Nature's pallat tasts The sweetest draught which Art provides her, Pow'r: Since Pow'r, Pride's Wine, but high in relish lasts Whilst fuming new, for time does turn it sowre? 21 Yet Pow'r Earth's tempting Fruit, Heav'n first did plant, From Man's first Serpent safe, Ambition's reach; Else Eden could not serve Ambition's want; Whom no command can rule, nor councel teach. 22 Pow'r is that luscious wine, which does the bold, The wise, and noble most intoxicate; Adds time to Youth, and takes it from the old; Yet I by surfeit this Elixer hate. 23 I curse those Wars that make my glory last; For which the Tuscan Widows curse me more; The barren Fields where I in Arms did fast, That I might surfeit on luxurious pow'r. 24 Thou Hermegild, who art for valor Crown'd, For honor trusted, and for wisdom heard; And you whom Councel has no less renown'd, Observe how vertue against peace has err'd. 25 Still I have fought, as if in Beauty's sight, Out-suffer'd patience, bred in Captives Breasts; Taught fasts, till Bodys like our Souls grew light; Outwatch'd the jealous, and outlabour'd Beasts. 26 These were my merits, my reward is Pow'r; An outward Trifle, bought with inward peace; Got in an Age, and rifled in an how'r; When Feav'rish love, the People's Fit, shall cease. 27 For did not pow'r on their fraile love depend, Prince Oswald had not treated with that love; Whose glory did in hasty darkness end; A sparke which vanish'd, as it upward strove. 28 By scorne of dangers and of ease, he sought The Lombards hearts, my Rhodalind, and Crowne; And much his youth had by his practice wrought, Had Gondibert not levell'd his renowne: 29 Had Gondibert not staid the Peoples Eies (Whose vertue stept 'twixt Oswald and their sight) Who knows but Rhodalind had bin his Prise, Or war must have secur'd Paternal right 30 Sad and uneasie is a long kept Throne; Not that the People think long pow'r unjust; But that for change, they wish best Monarchs gone; Fond change, the Peoples soon repented lust! 31 I did advance (though with some jealous paine) A forward vertue to my subjects love; Least one less temp'rate should their favour gaine; Whom their unstudy'd choice would more approve. 32 To thee sage Hermegild my self I leave, My fame and pow'r: Thee action cannot waste; Caution retard, nor promptitude deceave; Slowness belate, nor Hope drive on too faste. 33 Think Hubert Heir to Oswald's bold pretence; To whom the Camp at Brescia is inclin'd; The Duke at Bergamo will seek defence; And these are seeds of war for Rhodalind. 34 This said, his Councel he dismiss'd; who spy'd A growing rage, which he would fain conceal; They durst but nicely search, what he would hide; Least they inflame the wound that else might heal. 35 They haste to sev'ral Cares; some to allay Court's hectick Feaver, Faction (which does raign Where Luxury, the Syre of Want, does sway) Some to appease th' Alliance of the slain. 36 But Order now bids us again persue Th'unweary'd Motion of unhappy Fame; From Fields to Streets, from Streets to Court she flew; Where first she to the Kings Apartment came. 37 Thence through the Palace she her wings did air; And as her Wings, her Tongue too never ceas'd; Like restless Swallows in an Evening fair: At last does on a peaceful dwelling rest. 38 Where Sleep does yet that gentle Sex possesse, Who ne'r should more of Care's rude wakings know, But what may help sad Lovers to successe; Or imp loves wings when they are found too slow. 39 There Lovers seek the Royal Rhodalind; Whose secret brest was sick for Gondibert; And Orna, who had more in publick pin'd For Hurgonil, the Monarch of her heart. 40 And there the killing Laura did reside; She of whose Eies the Lombard Youth Complain; Yet often she for noble Arnold di'd; And knew not now, her Murderer was slain. 41 Nor Hugo, who was all with love indu'd; Whom still with teares the Lombard Ladies name; Esteeming Modern Lovers false, and rude, And Poets falser when they sing their fame. 42 These Beauties (who could soften Tyrant Kings) Sleep now conceal'd within their Curtains shade; Till rudely Fame, by shaking lowd her wings, Disturb'd their Eies, and their wak'd hearts dismay'd. 43 They heard in parcels by imperfect sound, A Tale too dismal to be understood; That all their Lovers lay in hallow'd ground; Temples their Bodies hid, the Fields their blood. 44 That this dire Morn to sad Verona brought The Duke and Oswald, of lov'd life depriv'd; And that of all who their fierce batail fought, Onely the mangled Hurgonil surviv'd. 45 This Tale, Fame's course, officious Friends convay'd, (Which are attendant Slaves, and Palace Grooms) Who by the Lover of some busie Mayd, From outward Courts sent it to inward Rooms. 46 Such horror brought, where love had onely us'd, Did yet breed more amazement then belief; Whilst Orna now, and Laura fly confus'd, To Rhodalind, Truth's Altar, for relief. 47 There with disorder'd voices they compare, And then derive what each has loosly learn'd; Each hope applies, where others most despaire; As doubting all but where her self's concern'd. 48 This weeping conf'rence had not lasted long, When Tybalt, free from Aribert's commands, Scapes the assembling Court's inquiring Throng, And enters here; where first he doubtful stands. 49 For Pitty, when he ruin'd Laura spi'de, Bids his discretion artfully complain; And shew far off, what Truth not long can hide: Death at a distance seen, may ease fears pain. 50 Their bus'ness now he can no more forbear; For who on their urg'd patience can prevail, Whose expectation is provok'd with fear? He therefore thus their patience did assail. 51 Kinde Heav'n that gave you vertue, give you peace; Delightful as your Beauties, be your Mindes; Still may your Lovers your renown increase, Though he who honor seeks, first danger findes! 52 Still may your beauty bear that ancient rate, When beauty was chaste Honors Merchandise; When Valor was chief Factor in Love's State; Danger, Love's stamp, and Beautie's currant price. 53 Renown'd be Oswald, who in high belief Of Rhodalind, her love with danger sought; In Love's Records be Gondibert the chief, Who for her right, not for his own has fought. 54 Though these for mighty mindes deserve Fame's voice; Yet Orna needs must boast of Hurgonil; Whose dangers well have justifi'd her choice, And might alone Fame's publick Trumpet fill. 55 Enlarg'd be Honor's Throne, that Arnold there And Hugo may for ever sit and rest, Free from their Valor's toyle, and Laura's feare; Which more then wounds disorder'd eithers Breast. 56 This said, he paws'd; findes each distrusts his art; For Hope and Doubt came and return'd apace, In chang'd Complexion from th' uncertain heart, Like frighted Scowtes for Tidings to the Face. 57 His Eye seem'd most imploy'd on Rhodalind; Whose love above her bashful caution sways; For naming Gondibert, he soon did finde, Her secret Soul shew'd pleasure at his praise. 58 Yet when she found her comforts did not last, And that as Oracles, the future taught, He hid Truth's Face, and darkened what was past; Thus Truth through all her mourning Vailes she sought, 59 Why in these Ladies do you lengthen paine, By giving them Grief's common med'cin, doubt? Ease those with death whose Lovers now are slaine; Life's fire a Feaver is, when Love's is out. 60 Yet think not that my cares peculiar are; Perhaps I from religious pitty learn'd, In Vertu's publick loss to take some share; For there, all but the vicious are concern'd. 61 Your prudence, Royal Maid (he strait replies) More then your birth, may claim the Lombards Crown Whoe're in conquest of your favor dies; For short lifes loss shall find a long renowne. 62 Then happy Oswald who is sure to gaine, Even by Ambition that undoes the wise; Great was th' attempt for which he's nobly slaine; And gets him praise, though he has mist the prise. 63 But happier Gondibert, who does survive To begg your Mercy, that he thus hath dar'd To own that cause, for which the world might strive; And conqu'ring, takes his wounds for his reward. 64 Be Hurgonil long distant from his Grave, Whose life was so important in this cause; Who for each wound he took, a wider gave, And lives t' enjoy the pleasure of applause. 65 To say, how Hugo and Lord Arnold strove For victorie, and mention their event, Were to provide such fun'ral rites for Love, As Death would be close Mourner, and repent. 66 Now Laura's blood back to her liver fled; True Beautie's Mint: For by her Heart, Love's Throne. Beautie's call'd in, like Coyn when Kings are dead; As if not currant now her Lover's gone. 67 And like her beauty, she had darkened life, But that with sprinckled water they restore (By sodain cold, with sodain heat at strife) Her spirits to those walks they us'd before. 68 She Arnold calls, then lost that name againe; Which Rhodalind, and Orna's teares bemone, Who carefully would her spent strength sustaine, Though Hope has scarcely yet brought back their owne: 69 Now they her Temples chas'd, and strait prepare Hot Eastern Fumes to reach her Brains cool'd sence; With Wine's fierce spirits these extracted are, Which warme but slowly, though of swift expence. 70 Yet now again she breath'd Lord Arnold's name; VVhich her apt Tongue through custom best exprest; Then to stay Life, that so unwilling came, VVith Cordial Epithems they bath'd her breast. 71 Th' attendant Maids, by Tybalt's ready ayde, To stop her Mourners teares, convey her now VVhere she may ease in her own Curtain's shade Her weary heart, and grief more Tongue allow. 72 No sooner thus was pity'd Laura gon, But Oswald's sister, Gartha the renown'd! Enters, as if the VVorld were overthrown, Or in the teares of the afflicted drown'd. 73 Unconquer'd as her beauty was her minde; VVhich wanted not a spark of Oswald's fire; Ambition lov'd, but ne'r to Love was kinde; Vex'd Thrones did more then quiet shades desire: 74 Her Garments now in loose neglect she wore, As suted to her wilde dishevel'd haire; Men in her shape might Natur's work adore, Yet ask, why Art's nice dress was absent there? 75 But soon they found what made this change appear; For meeting Truth, which slowly follows Fame, Rage would not give her leasure for a Teare To quench (ere thus she spake) her passion's flame. 76 Blasted be all your beauties Rhodalind, Till you a shame, and terror be to light; Unwing'd be Love, and slow as he is blind, Who with your Looks poyson'd my Brothers sight! 77 Low and neglected be your Father's Throne, Which like your beauty, Oswald did o're-rate; Let luckless war take Lands from his light Crown, Till those high cares he want that gave it weight! 78 Let Pow'rs consumption be his long disease, Heav'n's vexing Curb, which makes wild Monarchs tame And be he forc'd in froward age to please His Favour's Monster, who devoures his Fame. 79 May you soon feel (though secret in your love, As if your love were Sin) the publick scorn! May Gondibert, who is your glory, move Your pittie, when none else but you shall mourn! 80 To the dark Inne (where weary Valor, free From thankless dangers rests) brave Oswald's gone! But Hubert may, though vanquish'd, live to see Your Victor with his Victory undone! 81 This said, she mounts (with a tempestious Brow) The Charriot her Calabrian Coursers drew; Lifted by Slaves, (who still about her bow) As if with wings of swift revenge she flew. 82 To Brescia's Camp her course she had design'd; And bids her Char'ioter drive swiftly on, As if his steeds were dieted with winde! Slow seems their speed whose thoughts before them run. 83 The pav'd Streets kindle with her Chariot wheeles! The Omen of war's fire, the City spies, Which with those sparks struck by her coursers heels, Shine not so much as rage does in her Eies. 84 Those that observ'd her anger, grief, and haste, VVith a dejected melancholy mourn; She seem'd their Cities Genius as she pass'd, Who by their Sins expell'd, would ne'r return. 85 The gentle Ladies, she has left in tears, Who no example need nor cause to melt; For soon even grief's Alarms, our foremost fears, Kill those whose pain by Love's quick sence is felt. 86 And Rhodalind her fatal love does blame, Because she finds it now by Gartha spy'd, And does lament Love's fire, which bashful shame Cannot reveal, nor her discretion hide. 87 She would not have it wast, nor publick grow; But last conceal'd like that in Tullia's Urne; Or that which prosp'rous Chymists nicely show; Which as it thrives, must more in private burn. 88 Yet strait (grown valiant with her Victors fate) She would have Hymen hold his Torches high; And Love's fire pris'd, as Vestals theirs did rate; Which none durst quench, though free to ev'ry Eie. 89 Resolves her love whilst this new valor lasts, Shall undisguis'd her Father's sight endure; And Orna now to her dear Lover hastes; Whose outward wounds stay for her inward cure. 90 But here a wonder may arrest our thought, Why Tybalt (of his usual pitty void) To such sought Eares these direful sorrows brought, Since to the King he onely was imploy'd? 91 But these are Ridles of misterious Love! Tybalt in private long for Laura pin'd; And try'd how Arnold would her. passion move In death, who living ever fill'd her minde? 92 And by this trial how she Arnold us'd, He wisely ment to urge or stay his heart; But much by Love the Cautious are abus'd, Who his wilde Ridles would reduce to Art. Canto the Third. The ARGUMENT. Dead Oswald to his Camp by Hubert brought; The Camp from pity, are to fury wrought; Yet finde, when Gartha's looks does them surprise, Their forward Hands diverted by their Eies: Till with her voice new urg'd, they deeds persue Which even Revenge would, had it Eies, eschew. 1 When from the fatal Forrest Hubert rod To Brescia he and Borgio bent their way; That their though dead, yet much important Load, They might with horror to the Camp convay. 2 Revenge, impatient Hubert proudly sought! Revenge, which even when just the wise deride; For on past wrongs we spend our time and thought, Which scarce against the future can provide. 3 But Fame before him came where those are bred Who to her dismal Tales, faint credit give; Who could not think their mighty Oswald dead, Whilst they unconquer'd, and unwounded live. 4 Nor could Fame hope to make this Camp her Seate; Her Tales, the talking, idle, fearful, heare; But these are silent as in stolne retreate, Busie as life, and like the Dead past feare. 5 Neer Mela's flowry Banke this Army lay; Which Oswald's Syre, and Oswald oft had led Against the Uandales King; and twice the day They gain'd, whilst he from them and Empire fled. 6 From Youth expos'd, like Cattle in the Field; And not taught warmth, as City Infants are; But colds and fasts, to kill or to be kill'd; Like th'Elements their birth began with Warre. 7 So Rev'rend now, and strong in age appeare, As if maintain'd by more then humane breath; So grave, as if the Councellors they were, Not Executioners of Tyrant Death. 8 With silence (order's help, and marke of care) They chide that noise which heedless youth affect; Still course for use, for health they cleanly weare, And save in well fix'd Armes, all niceness chek'd. 9 They thought, those that unarm'd expos'd fraile life, But naked Nature valiantly betrai'd; Who was though naked, safe, till pride made strife; But made defence must use, now danger's made. 10 And those who toyle of Armor cannot byde, Lose Natur's force, which these in custom finde; And make (since strength's but Nature hourly try'd) The Body weak by softness of the Minde. 11 They seem'd so calme, and with their age so grave, So just and civil in their killing trade, As if all life were crime but what they save; Or Murder were by method lawful made. 12 Yet now that Manhood which those Victors makes (So weak is Man, where most he may be prowd) Pity, the tender'st of affections, shakes, And they become from order, loose, and lowd. 13 For when they saw the Brother of their Chief Led to their Camp by a defeated Traine, They soon to late scorn'd Rumor gave belief, And then by Hubert's wounds thought Oswald slaine. 14 But when disguis'd in death they Oswald saw, In a slow Charriot brought, with fun'ral pace; Themselves in an united Croud they draw; And give to grief one universal Face. 15 Wonder (which growes unactive by excesse) A while did their unruly passion stay; The object lasting, made their wonder lesse, Which fled to give their grief and anger way. 16 Yet first their grief (which Manhood should restraine) They vent in womens sighs, with teares allay'd; As if those women, taught them to complaine Who by their Swords are weeping Widows made. 17 As Icy Rockes which frost together binde, Stand silent, till as silently they melt, But when they meet in Currents unconfin'd, Swell, and grow loud, as if they freedom felt; 18 So these, unmov'd before, melt quietly In their first grief, till grief (when tears meet tears, And sighs meet sighs from ev'ry Breast and Eie) Unruly grows, and danger's visage bears. 19 When hastily they heard by whose dire hand Their Gen'ral fell, they think it cold to pause Till anger may be guided by command; And vain to ask of cureless Death the cause. 20 Some would to Bergamo their Ensignes bear, Against those Youth which Gondibert had led; Whom they in sacrifice would offer there, T' appease the living, and revenge the dead. 21 And some (to shew their rage more eminent) Would to Verona march, and there do deeds Should make the shining Court in blacks lament, And weep whilst the Victorious Faction bleeds. 22 Hubert (who saw Revenge advance so faste, Whilst Prudence, slower pac'd, was left behinde) Would keep their anger bent, yet slack their haste; Because the rash fall oftner then the blinde. 23 He first their melting pitty kindly prais'd, Which water'd Anger's forge, and urg'd their fire; That like to Meteors lasts by being rais'd, But when it first does sink, does strait expire. 24 Commends their anger, yet that flame he prays May keep the temp'rate Chymicks equal heat; That they in fury might not need allays, Nor charge so rashly as to want retreat. 25 Begs they this dismal night would there remain, And make the hopeful Morn their Guide; whilst Grief (Which high Revenge, as tameness should disdain) Sleep shall conceal, and give his wounds relief. 26 He Vasco, Paradine and Dargonet, With Oswald, to the red Pavilion sent; (Death's equal Pris'ners now for Nature's debt) And then retires with Borgio to his Tent. 27 This is the night the Brescians so bemoan'd; Who left their beds, and on their walls appear'd; As if th' oppressed World in Earthquakes groan'd, Or that some ruin'd Nation's sighs they heard; 28 Admir'd what in that Camp such griefs could raise, Where serious Death so oft had been abus'd, When ev'n their sportive Fencers Monthly Plays Profan'd that shape, which States for terror us'd. 29 Yet this lowd mourning will no wonder breed, When we with life lay Oswald's errors by, And use him as the Living use the Dead; Who first allow men vertue when they dy. 30 Still lib'ral of his life, of wealth as free; By which he chief in fighting Crowds became; Who must their Leaders Valors often see; And follow them for bounty more then fame. 31 This gen'ral mourning was to lowdness rais'd, By shewing Gifts he gave, and wounds he took; They chid at last his life which they had prais'd, Because such vertue it so soon forsook. 32 Now Night, by Grief neglected, hastes away! And they the Morne's officious Usher spy, The close Attendant on the Lord of Day; Who shews the warmer of the World is nigh. 33 And now the Drums, the Camps low Thunder, make War's thick united noise from ev'ry Guard; Though they Reveillees scorn, whom grief does wake, Who think, sleep Nature's curse, not toyls reward. 34 All night proud Borgio (chief in Hubert's trust) With haughty hopes, the Camp does waking keep: Ambition is more vigilant then Lust, And in hope's feaver is too hot to sleep. 35 Now Day, and Hubert haste to publick view; His wounds (unlucky more then dangerous) Are so refresh'd, that he the Army drew To a wide Grosse, and urg'd their Anger thus. 36 Friends to my Father! in whose wounds I see The envy'd Merit whence his triumphs came; And Fathers to my Brother, and to me; For onely you adopted us to Fame! 37 Forgive me that I there have feebly fought, Where Oswald in your cause did nobly strive; Whence of his blood these veines so much have brought, As makes me blush that I am still alive! 38 Your valiant Youth is gone, whom you have bred From milkie Childhood to the years of blood! By whom you joy'd so often to be led, Where firme as now your Trophys, then you stood! 39 Gon is he now, who still with low regard Bow'd to your age, your wounds as beauty kist; Knew Age was of your temp'rance the reward; And Courts in beauty by your skarrs subsist. 40 Yet was he not for mean pretensions slaine, Who for your inter'st not his own has fought; Vex'd that the Empire which your wounds did gaine, Was by a young unwounded Army sought! 41 For Gondibert (to whom the Court must bow, Now War is with your Fav'rite overthrowne) Will by his Camp of Boys at Bergamo, VVed her, who to your Valor owes the Crowne. 42 Blame not your Chief for his ambitious fire; VVho was but temp'rate, when he understood He might the Empire in your right require; A scant reward for your exhausted blood. 43 Thus Hubert spake; but now so fierce they grow, That Borgio strove to quench whom Hubert warm'd; To Bergamo, they cry'd, to Bergamo! And as they soon were vex'd, as soon are arm'd. 44 For to distinct and spacious Tents they hie, VVhere quick as Vests of Persia shifted are, Their Arms (which there in cleanly order lie) They take from moving VVardrobes of the warre. 45 Arm'd soon as Porquepines! as if like those, Their very rage them with defence supplies; As borne with it, and must have winged Foes That stoop from Heav'n to harme them by surprise. 46 VVith Ensignes now display'd, their Force they draw To hasty order, and begin to move; But are amus'd by something that they saw, VVhich look'd like all that ere they heard of love. 47 Unusual to their Camp such objects were, Yet this no ill effect from wonder wrought; For it appeas'd them by approaching neer, And satisfi'd their Eies in all they sought. 48 And this was Gartha in her Chariot drawn; Who through the swarthy Region of the Night Drove from the Court; and as a second dawn Breaks on them, like the Mornes Reserve of Light. 49 Through all the Camp she moves with Fun'ral pace, And still bowes meekly down to all she saw; Her grief gave speaking beauty to her Face; Which lowly look'd, that it might pitty draw. 50 VVhen by her Slaves, her name they understood, Her Lines of feature heedfully they view; In her complexion track their Gen'ral's blood, And find her more, then what by fame they knew. 51 They humbly her to that Pavilion guide, VVhere Hubert his bold Chiefs with fury fir'd; But his ambition, when he Gartha spy'd (To give his sorrow place) a while retir'd. 52 With his respectful help she does descend; Where they, with dear imbraces mingle Tears, But now her Male Revenge would grief suspend; Revenge, through Grief, too feminine appears. 53 But when her dear Allies, dead Paradine, And Dargonet she saw; that Manlinesse Which her weak Sex assum'd, she does decline; As bred too soft, to mannage griefs excesse. 54 Then soon return'd, as loath to shew her Eies No more of Oswald then she must forsake; But sorrow's moisture, heat of anger dries; And mounted in her Chariot, thus she spake: 55 If you are those of whom I oft have heard My Father boast, and that have Oswald bred; Ah, where is now that rage our Tyrant fear'd, Whose Darling is alive, though yours be dead? 56 The Court shines out at Rhodalind's commands, To me (your drooping Flowre) no beam can spare; Where Oswald's name, new planted by your hands, Withers, as if it lost the Planters care. 57 From Rhodalind I thus disorder'd flie; Least she should say, thy Fate unpity'd comes! Goe sing, where now thy Fathers Fighters lie, Thy Brothers requiem, to their conqu'ring Drums! 58 The happy Fields by those brave Warriors fought, (Which from the Dictates of thy aged Syre, Oswald in high Victorious Numbers wrot) Thou shalt no more sign to thy silenc'd Lyre! 59 Such scorns, pow'r on unlucky vertue throws, When Courts with prosp'rous vices wanton are; Who your Authentick age despise for those, VVho are to you but Infants of the warre. 60 Thus though she spake, her looks did more perswade; Like vertuous anger did her colour rise, As if th'injurious world it would invade, VVhilst tears of rage not pitty drown her Eies. 61 The Sun did thus to threatned Nature show His anger red, whilst guilt look'd pale in all; VVhen Clouds of Floods did hang about his Brow, And then shrunk back to let that anger fall. 62 And so she turn'd her Face, not as to grieve At ruine, but to lisence what she rais'd; VVhilst they (like common Throngs) all Tongues believe VVhen Courts are tax'd, but none when they are prais'd. 63 Like Commets, Courts afflict the vulgar Eie; And when they largest in their glory blaze, People through ignorance think plagues are nie, And till they waste with mourning wonder gaze. 64 These scorn the Courts dissertion of their age; The active, ease impos'd, like pain endure; For though calm rest does Age's pains asswage, Yet few the sickness own to get the cure. 65 To Heav'n they lift their looks! whose Sun ne'r saw Rage so agreed, as now he does behold; Their shining swords all at an instant draw, And bad him judge next day if they were old! 66 And of Verona wish'd him take his leave; Which ere his third return they will destroy, Till none shall guess by ruines where to grieve, No more then Phrygians where to weep for Troy. 67 Thus Bergamo is soon forgot, whilst all Alowd, Verona cry! Verona must (That reach'd the Clouds) low as her Quarries fall! The Court they'll bury in the Cities dust. Canto the Fourth. The ARGUMENT. At Oswald's Camp arrives wise Hermegild; Whose presence does a new diversion yield; In Councel he reveals his secret Breast; Would mingle Love with Empires interest: From rash revenge, to peace the Camp invites, Who Oswald's Fun'ral grace with Roman Rites. 1 In this distemper whilst the humors strive T' assemble, they again diverted are; For tow'rds their Trenches Twenty Chariots drive, Swiftly as Syrians when they charge in warre. 2 They Hermegild with Court attendants spy'd; Whose haste to Hubert does advice intend; To warn him that just Fate can ne'r provide For rash beginnings a succesful end. 3 But fate for Hermegild provided well; This Story else (which him the wise does call) Would here his private ruine sadly tell, I hastning to prevent the publick Fall. 4 His noble blood obscurely had been shed, His undistinguish'd Limbs scatter'd unknown, As is the dust of Victors long since dead, Which here and there, by every wind is blown. 5 Such was their rage when on Verona's way (With his rich Trayn) they saw from Court he came; Till some did their impetuous fury stay; And gave his life protection for his fame, 6 Told them his valor had been long allow'd; That much the Lombard's to his conduct ow; And this preserv'd him, for the very Crowd Felt honor here, and did to valor bow. 7 Vain Wrath! Deform'd, unquiet Child of Pride! Which in a few the People madness call; But when by number they grew dignify'd, What's rage in some is liberty in all. 8 Through dangers of this lawless liberty, He like Authentick pow'r does boldly pass; And with a quiet and experienc'd eye, Through Death's foul Vizard, does despise his face. 9 At Hubert's Tent he lights, where Hubert now With Gartha of this Torrent does advise; Which he believes does at the highest flow, And must like Tides, sink when it cannot rise. 10 When Hermegild he saw, he did disperse Those cares assembled in his looks, and strove (Though to his Master, and the Court perverse) To shew him all the civil signes of Love. 11 For him in stormy war he glorious knew; Nor in calm Councels was he less renown'd; And held him now to Oswald's Faction true, As by his love, the world's first Tenure, bound. 12 For he (though wasted in the ebb of blood, When Man's Meridian tow'rds his Evening turnes) Makes against Nature's Law, Love's Charter good, And as in raging Youth for Gartha burnes. 13 Who did his sute not only disapprove, Because the summer of his life was past; And she fresh blown; but that even highest love Growes tastless to Ambition's higher taste, 14 Yet now in such a great and single cause, With nice Ambition, nicer Love complies; And she (since to revenge he usefull was) Perswades his hope with Rhet'rique of her Eyes. 15 A closse division of the Tent they strait By outward Guards secure from all resort; Then Hermegild does thus the cause relate, Which to the Camp dispatch'd him from the Court. 16 Important Prince! who justly dost succeed To Oswalds hopes, and all my loyal aide; Vertue as much in all thy wounds does bleed, As love in me, since wounded by that Maide. 17 Long have I sayl'd through Times vexatious sea; And first set out with all that Youth is worth; The Tropicks pass'd of bloods hot bravery, With all the Sailes, gay Flags, and Streamers forth! 18 But as in hotter voyages, Ships most Weare out their trim, yet then they chiefly gain By inward stowage, what is outward lost; So men, decays of youth, repaire in brain. 19 If I experience boast when youth decayes, Such vanity may Gartha's pity move, Since so I seek your service by self praise, Rather then seem unusefull where I love. 20 And never will I (though by Time supply'd With such discretion as does Man improve) To shew discretion, wiser Nature hide, By seeming now asham'd to say I Love. 21 For love his pow'r has in gray Senates shown, Where he, as to green Courts, does freely come; And though loud youth, his visits makes more known, With graver Age he's privately at home. 22 Scarce Greece, or greater Rome a Victor showes, Whom more Victorious Love did not subdue; Then blame not me who am so weak to those; Whil'st Gartha all exceeds, that ere they knew. 23 Hope (Love's first food) I ne'r till now did know; Which Love, as yet but temp'rately devours; And claimes not love for love, since Gartha so For Autumn Leaves, should barter Summer Flowers. 24 I dare not vainly wish her to be kinde, Till for her love, my Arts and Pow'r bestow The Crown on thee, adorn'd with Rhodalind; Which yet for Gartha is a price too low. 25 This said, he paws'd; and now the hectick heate Of Oswald's blood, doubled their Pulses pace; Which high, as if they would be heard, did beate, And hot Ambition shin'd in eithers face. 26 For Hermegild they knew could much outdoe His words, and did possess great Aribert, Not in the Courts cheap Glass of outward showe, But by a study'd Tenure of the heart. 27 Whilst this try'd truth does make their wishes sure, Hubert on Gartha looks, with suing Eyes For Hermegild; whose love she will endure, And made Ambition yield what Youth denies. 28 Yet in this bargain of her self, she knowes Not how to treat; but all her chief desires, Bids Hubert, as the Twins of his, dispose To glory and revenge; and then retires. 29 But with such blushes Hermegild she leaves, As the unclouded Evening's Face adorn; Nor much he for her parting glory grieves, Since such an Evening bodes a happy Morn. 30 Now Hermegild by vowes does Hubert binde, (Vowes by their fate in Lombard Story known) He Gartha makes the price of Rhodalind, And Aribert his Tenant to the Crown. 31 He bids him now the Armies rage allay; By rage (said he) only they Masters are Of those they chuse, when temp'rate, to obay: Against themselves th'impatient chiefly warre. 32 We are the Peoples Pilots, they our winds; To change by Nature prone; but Art Laveers, And rules them till they rise with Stormy Mindes; Then Art with danger against Nature Steers. 33 Where calms have first amus'd, Storms most prevail; Close first with Calms the Courts suspitious Eyes; That whilst with all their trim, they sleeping sail, A sudden Gust may wrack them by surprise. 34 Your Army will (though high in all esteem That ever rev'renc'd Age to Action gave) But a small Party to Verona seem; Which yearly to such Numbers yields a Grave. 35 Nor is our vaste Metropolis, like those Tame Towns, which peace has soft'ned into fears; But Death deform'd in all his Dangers knows; Dangers, which he like frightful Vizards wears. 36 From many Camps, who forraign winters felt, Verona has her conqu'ring Dwellers ta'ne; In War's great Trade, with richest Nations delt; And did their Gold and Fame with Iron gain. 37 Yet to the mighty Aribert it bowes; A King out-doing all the Lombard Line! Whose Court (in Iron clad) by coursness showes A growing pow'r, which fades when Courts grow fine. 38 Scorn not the Youthful Camp at Bergamo; For they are Victors, though in years but young; The War does them, they it by action know, And have obedient Minds, in Bodies strong. 39 Be slow, and stay for aides, which haste forsakes! For though Occasion still does Sloth out-goe, The rash, who run from help, she ne'r o'er-takes, Whose haste thinks Time, the Post of Nature, slow. 40 This is a cause which our Ambition fills; A cause, in which our strength we should not waste, In vain like Giants, who did heave at Hills; 'Tis too unwildly for the force of haste. 41 A cause for graver Minds that learned are In mistick Man; a cause which we must gain By surer methods then depend on Warre; And respite valor, to imploy the Brain. 42 In the King's Scale your merits are too light; Who with the Duke, weighs his own partial heart; Make then the gift of Empire publick right, And get in Rhodalind the Peoples part. 43 But this rough Tide, the meeting Multitude, If we oppose, we make our voyage long; Yet when we with it row, it is subdu'd; And we are wise, when Men in vain are strong. 44 Then to the People sue, but hide your force; For they believe the strong are still unjust; Never to armed Sutors yield remorse; And where they see the pow'r, the right distrust. 45 Assault their pity as their weakest part; Which the first Plaintiff never failes to move; They search but in the face to finde the heart; And grief in Princes, more then triumph love. 46 And to prepare their pity, Gartha now Should in her sorrows height with me return; For since their Eyes at all distresses flow, How will they at afflicted beauty mourn. 47 Much such a pledge of Peace will with the King (Urg'd by my int'rest here) my pow'r improve; And much my power will to your int'rest bring, If from the watchful Court you hide my Love. 48 If Gartha deignes to love, our love must grow Unseen, like Mandrakes wedded under ground; That I (still seeming unconcern'd) may know The King's new depths, which length of trust may sound! 49 Thus Hermegild his study'd thoughts declar'd; Whilst Hubert (who believ'd, discover'd love A solid Pledge for hidden faith) prepar'd To stay the Camp, so furious to remove. 50 And now their rage (by correspondence spred) Borgio allays, that else like sparks of fire (Which drops at first might drowne) by matter fed, At last to quench the flame may seas require. 51 As with the Sun they rose in wrath, their wrath So with his heat increas'd; but now he hastes Down Heav'ns steep Hill, to his Atlantick Bath; Where he refreshes till his Feaver wastes. 52 With his (by Borgio's help) their heat declin'd; So soon lov'd Eloquence does Throngs subdue; The common Mistress to each private Minde; Painted and dress'd to all, to no Man true. 53 To Court his Gartha, Hermegild attends: And with old Lovers vaine poetick Eyes, Markes how her beauty, when the Sun descends, His pitty'd Evening poverty supplies. 54 The Army now to Neighb'ring Brescia bear, With dismal pomp, the slain: In hallow'd ground They Paradine, and Dargonet interr; And Vasco much in painful war renoun'd. 55 To Oswald (whose illustrious Roman minde Shin'd out in life, though now in dying hid) Hubert these Roman fun'ral rites assign'd; Which yet the World's last law had not forbid. 56 Thrice is his Body clean by bathing made; And when with Victor's Oyle anointed or'e, 'Tis in the Pallace Gate devoutly layd'e, Clad in that Vest which he in Battel wore. 57 Whilst seven succeeding Suns pass sadly by, The Palace seems all hid in Cypress Boughs; From ancient Lore, of Man's mortality The Type, for where 'tis lopp'd it never grows. 58 The publick fun'ral voice, till these expire, Cryes out; here Greatness, tir'd with honor, rests! Come see what Bodies are, when Souls retire; And visit death, ere you become his Guests! 59 Now on a Purple Bed the Corps they raise; Whilst Trumpets summon all the common Quire In tune to mourn him, and disperse his praise; And then move slowly tow'rds the Fun'ral fire! 60 They beare before him Spoiles they gain'd in warre; And his great Ancestors in Sculpture wrought; And now arrive, where Hubert does declare How oft and well, he for the Lombards fought. 61 Here, in an Altar's form, a Pile is made Of Unctious Firr, and Sleepers fatal Ewe; On which the Body is by Mourners laid, Who their sweet Gummes (their last kind Tribute threw.) 62 Hubert his Arme, westward, aversly stretch'd; Whilst to the hopefull East his Eyes were turn'd; And with a hallow'd Torch the Pyle he reach'd; Which seen, they all with utmost clamor mourn'd. 63 Whilst the full Flame aspires, Oswald (they cry) Farewell! we follow swiftly as the Houres! For-with Times's wings, tow'rds Death, even Cripples flie! This said, the hungry Flame its food devoures. 64 Now Priests with Wine the Ashes quench, and hide The Rev'renc'd Reliques in a Marble Urne. The old dismissive Ilicet is cry'd By the Town voice, and all to Feasts returne. 65 Thus Urnes may Bodies shew; but the fled Minde The Learn'd seek vainly; for whose quest we pay, With such success as cousen'd Shepheards finde, Who seek to Wizards when their Cattel stray. Canto the Fifth. The ARGUMENT. The House of Astragon; where in distress Of Nature, Gondibert for Art's redress Was by old Ulfin brought: where Art's hard strife, In studying Nature for the aid of Life, Is by full wealth and conduct easie made; And Truth much visited, though in her shade. 1 From Brescia swiftly o're the bord'ring Plain, Return we to the House of Astragon; Where Gondibert, and his successfull Train, Kindly lament the Victory they won. 2 But though I Fame's great Book shall open now, Expect a while, till she that Decad reads, Which does this Dukes eternal Story show, And aged Ulfin cites for special deeds. 3 Where Friendship is renown'd in Ulfinore; Where th' ancient musick of delightful verse, Does it no less in Goltho's Breast adore, And th'union of their equal hearts reherse. 4 These weary Victors the descending Sun Led hither, where swift Night did them surprise; And where, for valiant toiles, wise Astragon, With sweet rewards of sleep, did fill their Eyes. 5 When to the needy World Day did appear, And freely op'd her Treasury of light, His House (where Art and Nature Tennants were) The pleasure grew, and bus'ness of their sight. 6 Where Ulfin (who an old Domestick seems, And rules as Master in the Owners Breast) Leads Goltho to admire what he esteems; And thus, what he had long observ'd, exprest. 7 Here Art by such a diligence is serv'd, As does th' unwearied Planets imitate; Whose motion (life of Nature) has preserv'd The world, which God vouchsaf'd but to create. 8 Those heights, which else Dwarf Life could never reach, Here, by the wings of diligence they climbe; Truth (skar'd with Terms from canting Schools) they teach; And buy it with their best sav'd Treasure, Time, 9 Here all Men seem Recov'rers of time past; As busie as intentive Emmets are; As alarm'd Armies that intrench in haste, Or Cities, whom unlook'd-for sieges skare. 10 Much it delights the wise Observers Eye, That all these toiles direct to sev'ral skills; Some from the Mine to the hot Furnace hie, And some from flowry Fields to weeping Stills. 11 The first to hopefull Chymicks matter bring, Where Med'cine they extract for instant cure; These bear the sweeter burthens of the Spring; Whose vertues (longer known) though slow, are sure. 12 See there wet Divers from Fossone sent! Who of the Seas deep Dwellers knowledge give; Which (more unquiet then their Element) By hungry war, upon each other live. 13 Pearl to their Lord, and Cordial Coral these Present; which must in sharpest liquids melt; He with Nigella cures that dull disease They get, who long with stupid Fish have dwelt. 14 Others through Quarries dig, deeply below Where Desart Rivers, cold, and private run; Where Bodies conservation best they know, And Mines long growth, and how their veines begun. 15 He shewes them now Tow'rs of prodigious height, Where Natures Friends, Philosophers remain To censure Meteors in their cause and flight. And watch the Wind's authority on Rain. 16 Others with Optick Tubes the Moons scant face (Vaste Tubes, which like long Cedars mounted lie) Attract through Glasses to so near a space, As if they came not to survey, but prie. 17 Nine hasty Centuries are now fulfill'd, Since Opticks first were known to Astragon; By whom the Moderns are become so skill'd, They dream of seeing to the Maker's Throne. 18 And wisely Astragon, thus busie grew, To seek the Stars remote societies; And judge the walks of th' old, by finding new; For Nature's law, in correspondence lies. 19 Man's pride (grown to Religion) he abates, By moving our lov'd Earth; which we think fix'd; Think all to it, and it to none relates; With others motion scorn to have it mix'd; 20 As if 'twere great and stately to stand still Whilst other Orbes dance on; or else think all Those vaste bright Globes (to shew God's needless skill) Were made but to attend our little Ball. 21 Now near a sever'd Building they discern'd (Which seem'd, as in a pleasant shade, retir'd) A Throng, by whose glad diligence they learn'd, They came from Toyles which their own choice desir'd 22 This they approach, and as they enter it Their Eyes were stay'd, by reading o'er the Gate, Great Natures Office, in large letters writ; And next, they mark'd who there in office sate. 23 Old busie Men, yet much for wisdom fam'd; Hasty to know, though not by haste beguil'd; These fitly, Nature's Registers were nam'd; The Throng were their Intelligeneers stil'd: 24 Who stop by snares, and by their chace o'retake All hidden Beasts the closer Forrest yields; All that by secret sence their rescue make, Or trust their force, or swiftness in the Fields. 25 And of this Throng, some their imployment have In fleeting Rivers, some fix'd Lakes beset; Where Nature's self, by shifts, can nothing save From trifling Angles, or the swal'wing Net. 26 Some, in the spacious Ayre, their Prey o'retake, Cous'ning, with hunger, Falcons of their wings; Whilst all their patient observations make, Which each to Nature's Office duely brings. 27 And there of ev'ry Fish, and Foule, and Beast, The wiles these learned Registers record, Courage, and feares, their motion and their rest; Which they prepare for their more learned Lord. 28 From hence to Nature's Nursery they goe; Where seems to grow all that in Eden grew; And more (if Art her mingled Species show) Then th' Hebrew King, Nature's Historian, knew. 29 Impatient Simplers climbe for Blossomes here; When Dewes (Heav'n's secret milk) in unseen show'rs First feed the early Childhood of the year; And in ripe Summer, stoop for Hearbs and Flow'rs. 30 In Autumn, Seeds and Berries they provide; Where Nature a remaining force preserves; In Winter digg for Roots, where she does hide That stock, which if consum'd, the next Spring sterves. 31 From hence (fresh Nature's flourishing Estate!) They to her wither'd Receptacle come; Where she appears the loathsome Slave of Fate; For here her various Dead possess the Room. 32 This dismall Gall'ry, lofty, long, and wide; Was hung with Skelitons of ev'ry kinde; Humane, and all that learned humane pride Thinks made t' obey Man's high immortal Minde. 33 Yet on that Wall hangs he too, who so thought; And she dry'd by him, whom that He obey'd; By her an El'phant that with Heards had fought, Of which the smallest Beast made her afraid. 34 Next it, a Whale is high in Cables ty'd, Whose strength might Herds of Elephants controul; Then all, (in payres of ev'ry kinde) they spy'd Which Death's wrack leaves, of Fishes, Beasts, and Fowl. 35 These Astragon (to watch with curious Eye The diff'rent Tenements of living breath) Collects, with what far Travailers supply; And this was call'd, The Cabinet of Death. 36 Which some the Monument of Bodies, name; The Arke, which saves from Graves all dying kindes; This to a structure led, long known to Fame, And call'd, The Monument of banish'd Mindes. 37 Where, when they thought they saw in well sought Books, Th' assembled soules of all that Men held wise, It bred such awfull rev'rence in their looks, As if they saw the bury'd writers rise. 38 Such heaps of written thoughts (Gold of the Dead, Which Time does still disperse, but not devour) Made them presume all was from Deluge free'd, Which long-liv'd-Authors writ ere Noah's Show'r. 39 They saw Egyptian Roles, which vastly great, Did like faln Pillars lie, and did display The tale of Natures life, from her first heat, Till by the Flood o'er-cool'd, she felt decay. 40 And large as these (for Pens were Pencils then) Others that Egypts, chiefest Science show'd; Whose River forc'd Geometry on Men, Which did distinguish what the Nyle o're-flow'd. 41 Near them, in Piles, Chaldean Cous'ners lie; Who the hid bus'ness of the Stars relate; Who make a Trade of worship'd Prophesie; And seem to pick the Cabinet of Fate. 42 There Persian Magi stand; for wisdom prais'd; Long since wise Statesmen, now Magicians thought; Altars and Arts are soon to fiction rais'd, And both would have, that miracles are wrought. 43 In a dark Text, these States-men left their Mindes; For well they knew, that Monarch's Mistery (Like that of Priests) but little rev'rence findes, VVhen they the Curtain op'e to ev'ry Eye. 44 Behinde this Throng, the talking Greeks had place; VVho Nature turn to Art, and Truth disguise, As skill does native beauty oft deface; With Termes they charm the weak, and pose the wise. 45 Now they the Hebrew, Greek and Roman spie; Who for the Peoples ease, yoak'd them with Law; Whom else, ungovern'd lusts would drive awry; And each his own way frowardly would draw. 46 In little Tomes these grave first Lawyers lie, In Volumes their Interpreters below; Who first made Law an Art, then Misterie; So cleerest springs, when troubled, cloudy grow. 47 But here, the Souls chief Book did all precede; Our Map tow'rds Heav'n; to common Crowds deny'd; Who proudly aim to teach, ere they can read; And all must stray, where each will be a Guide. 48 About this sacred little Book did stand Unweildly Volumes, and in number great; And long it was since any Readers hand Had reach'd them from their unfrequented Seat. 49 For a deep Dust (which Time does softly shed, Where only Time does come) their Covers beare; On which, grave Spyders, streets of Webbs had spread; Subtle, and slight, as the grave Writers were. 50 In these, Heav'ns holy Fire does vainly burn; Nor warms, nor lights, but is in Sparkles spent; VVhere froward Authors, with disputes, have torn The Garment seamless as the Firmament. 51 These are the old Polemicks, long since read, And shut by Astragon; who thought it just, They, like the Authors (Truth's Tormentors) dead, Should lie unvisited, and lost in dust. 52 Here the Arabian's Gospel open lay, (Men injure Truth, who Fiction nicely hide) Where they the Monk's audacious stealths survey, From the World's first, and greater second Guide. 53 The Curious much perus'd this, then, new Book; As if some secret wayes to Heav'n it taught; For straying from the old, men newer look, And prise the found, not finding those they sought. 54 We, in Tradition (Heav'n's dark Mapp) descrie Heav'n worse, then ancient Mapps farr India show; Therefore in new, we search where Heav'n does lie; The Mind's sought Ophir, which we long to know. 55 Or as a Planter, though good Land he spies, Seeks new, and when no more so good he findes, Doubly esteems the first; so Truth men prise; Truth, the discov'ry made by trav'ling Mindes. 56 And this false Book, till truly understood By Astragon, was openly display'd; As counterfeit; false Princes, rather shou'd Be shewn abroad, then in close Prison lay'd. 57 Now to the old Philosophers they come; Who follow'd Nature with such just despaire, As some do Kings farr off; and when at home, Like Courtiers, boast, that they deep secrets share. 58 Near them are grave dull Moralists, who give Counsell to such, as still in publick dwell; At sea, in Courts, in Camps, and Citties live; And scorn experience from th' unpractis'd Cell. 59 Esop with these stands high, and they below; His pleasant wisdome mocks their gravity; Who Vertue like a tedious Matron show, He dresses Nature to invite the Eye. 60 High skill their Ethicks seemes, whilst he stoops down To make the People wise; their learned pride Makes all obscure, that Men may prise the Gown; With ease he teaches, what with pain they hide. 61 And next (as if their bus'ness rul'd Mankinde) Historians stand bigg as their living looks; Who thought, swift Time they could in fetters binde; Till his Confessions they had ta'ne in Books: 62 But Time oft scap'd them in the shades of Night; And was in Princes Closets oft conceal'd, And hid in Battels smoke; so what they Write Of Courts and Camps, is oft by guess reveal'd, 63 Near these, Physitians stood; who but reprieve Like life a Judge, whom greater pow'r does awe; And cannot an Almighty pardon give; So much yields Subject Art to Nature's Law. 64 And not weak Art, but Nature we upbraid, When our frail essence proudly we take ill; Think we are robb'd, when first we are decay'd And those were murder'd whom her law did kill. 65 Now they refresh, after this long survey, With pleasant Poets, who the Soul sublime; Fame's Heraulds, in whose Triumphs they make way; And place all those whom Honor helps to climbe. 66 And he who seem'd to lead this ravish'd Race, Was Heav'n's lov'd Lanreat, that in Jewry writ; Whose Harp approach'd Gods Ear, though none his Face Durst see, and first made inspiration, wit. 67 And his Attendants, such blest Poets are, As make unblemish'd Love, Courts best delight; And sing the prosp'rous Battels of just warre; By these the loving, Love, and valiant, fight. 68 O hireless Science! and of all alone The Liberal! Meanly the rest each State In pension treats, but this depends on none; Whose worth they rev'rendly forbear to rate. Canto the Sixth. The ARGUMENT. How Astragon to Heav'n his duty pays In Pray'r, and Penitence, but most in Praise: To these he sev'ral Temples dedicates; And Ulfin their distinguish'd use relates. Religion's Rites, seem here, in Reasons sway; Though Reason must Religion's Laws obey. 1 The noble Youths (reclaim'd by what they saw) Would here unquiet war, as pride, forsake; And study quiet Nature's pleasant Law; Which Schools, through pride, by Art uneasie make 2 But now a sudden Shout their thoughts diverts! So cheerfull, general, and loud it was, As pass'd through all their Ears, and fill'd their Hearts; Which lik'd the joy, before they knew the cause. 3 This Ulfin, by his long Domestick skill Does thus explain. The Wise I here observe, Are wise tow'rds God; in whose great service still, More then in that of Kings, themselves they serve. 4 He who this Building's Builder did create, Has an Apartment here Triangular; Where Astragon, Three Fanes did dedicate, To dayes of Praise, of Penitence, and Pray'r. 5 To these, from diff'rent motives, all proceed; For when discov'ries they on Nature gain, They praise high Heavn which makes their work succeed, But when it fails, in Penitence complain. 6 If after Praise, new blessings are not giv'n, Nor mourning Penitence can ills repair, Like practis'd Beggers, they solicite Heav'n, And will prevail by violence of Pray'r. 7 The Temple built for Pray'r, can neither boast The Builder's curious Art, nor does declare, By choice Materials he intended cost; To shew, that nought should need to tempt to Pray'r. 8 No Bells are here! Unhing'd are all the Gates! Since craving in distress is naturall, All lies so op'e that none for ent'rance waites; And those whom Faith invites, can need no call. 9 The Great have by distinction here no name; For all so cover'd come, in grave disguise, (To shew none come for decency or fame) That all are strangers to each others Eyes. 10 But Penitence appears unnaturall; For we repent what Nature did perswade; And we lamenting Man's continu'd fall, Accuse what Nature necessary made. 11 Since the requir'd extream of Penitence Seems so severe, this Temple was design'd, Solemn and strange without, to catch the sense, And dismal shew'd within, to awe the mind. 12 Of sad black Marble was the outward Frame, (A Mourning Monument to distant sight) But by the largeness when you near it came, It seem'd the Palace of Eternal Night. 13 Black beauty (which black Meroens had prais'd Above their own) sadly adorn'd each part; In Stone, from Nyle's hard Quarries, slowly rais'd, And slowly'er polish'd by Numidian Art. 14 Hither a loud Bells tole, rather commands, Then seems t'invite the persecuted Eare; A summons Nature hardly understands; For few, and slow are those who enter here, 15 Within, a dismall Majesty they find! All gloomy, great, all silent does appear! As Chaos was, ere th' Elements were design'd; Man's evil fate seems hid and fashion'd here. 16 Here all the Ornament is rev'rend black; Here, the check'd Sun his universal Face Stops bashfully, and will no entrance make; As if he spy'd Night naked through the Glass. 17 Black Curtains hide the Glass; whilst from on high A winking Lamp, still threatens all the Room; As if the lazy flame just now would die: Such will the Sun's last light appear at Doom! 18 This Lamp was all, that here inform'd all Eyes; And by reflex, did on a Picture gain Some few false Beames, that then from Sodome rise; Where Pencils feigne the fire which Heav'n did rain. 19 This on another Tablet did reflect, Where twice was drawn the am'rous Magdaline; Whilst beauty was her care, then her neglect; And brightest through her Tears she seem'd to shine. 20 Near her, seem'd crucifi'd, that lucky Thief (In Heav'n's dark Lot'ry prosp'rous, more then wise) Who groap'd at last, by chance, for Heav'n's relief, And Throngs undoes with Hope, by one drawn Prise. 21 In many Figures by reflex were sent, Through this black Vault (instructive to the minde) That early, and this tardy Penitent; For with Obsidian stone 'twas chiefly lin'd, 22 The Seats were made of Ethiopian Wood, The polish'd Ebony, but thinly fill'd; For none this place by nature understood; And practise, when unpleasant, makes few skill'd. 23 Yet these, whom Heav'n's misterious choice fetch'd in, Quickly attain Devotion's utmost scope; For having softly mourn'd away their sin, They grow so certain, as to need no Hope. 24 At a low Door they enter, but depart Through a large Gate, and to fair Fields proceed; Where Astragon makes Nature last by Art, And such long Summers shews, as ask no seed. 25 Whilst Ulfin this black Temple thus exprest To these kind Youths, whom equal soul endeers; (Goltho, and Ulfinore, in friendship blest) A second gen'ral shout salutes their Eares. 26 To the glad House of Praise this shout does call! To Pray'r (said he) no Summons us invites, Because distress does thither summon all; As the loud tole to Penitence excites. 27 But since, dull Men, to gratitude are slow; And joy'd consent of Hearts is high Heav'ns choice; To this of Praise, shouts summon us to goe; Of Hearts assembled, the unfeigned Voice. 28 And since, wise Astragon, with due applause, Kinde Heav'n, for his success, on Nature payes; This day, Victorious Art, has giv'n him cause, Much to augment Heav'n's lov'd reward of praise. 29 For this effectuall day his Art reveal'd, What has so oft Made Nature's spies to pine, The Loadstones mistick use, so long conceal'd In close allyance with the courser Mine. 30 And this, in sleepy Vision, he was bid To Register in Characters unknown; Which Heav'n will have from Navigators hid, Till Saturne's walk be Twenty Circuits grown. 31 For as Religion (in the warm East bred) And Arts (which next to it most needfull were) From Vices sprung from their corruption, fled; And thence vouchsaf'd a cold Plantation here; 32 So when they here again corrupted be, (For Man can even his Antidotes infect) Heav'n's reserv'd World they in the West shall see; To which this stone's hid vertue will direct. 33 Religion then (whose Age this World upbraids, As scorn'd deformitie) will thither steer; Serv'd at fit distance by the Arts, her Maids; Which grow too bold, when they attend too neer. 34 And some, whom Traffick thither tempts, shall thence In her exchange (though they did grudge her shrines, And poorly banish'd her to save expence) Bring home the Idol, Gold, from new found Mines. 35 Till then, sad Pilots must be often lost, Whilst from the Ocean's dreaded Face they shrink; And seeking safety near the cous'ning Coast, With windes surpriz'd, by Rocky ambush sink. 36 Or if success rewards, what they endure, The World's chief Jewel, Time, they then ingage And forfeit (trusting long the Cynosure) To bring home nought but wretched Gold, and Age. 37 Yet when this plague of ignorance shall end, (Dire ignorance, with which God plagues us most; Whilst we not feeling it, him most offend) Then lower'd Sayles no more shall tide the Coast. 38 They with new Tops to Formasts and the Main, And Misens new, shall the Ocean's Breast invade; Stretch new Sayles out, as Armes to entertain Those windes, of which their Fathers were afraid. 39 Then (sure of either Pole) they will with pride, In ev'ry storm, salute this constant Stone! And scorn that Star, which ev'ry Cloud could hide; The Seamen's spark! which soon, as seen, is gone! 40 'Tis sung, the Ocean shall his Bonds untie, And Earth in half a Globe be pent no more; Typhis shall saile, till Thule he descry, But a domestick step to distant Shore! 41 This Astragon had read; and what the Greek Old Cretias, in Egyptian Books had found; By which, his travail'd soul, new Worlds did seek, And div'd to find the old Atlantis droun'd. 42 Grave Ulfin thus discours'd; and now he brings The Youths to view the Temple built for Praise; Where Olive, for th' Olimpian Victor Springs; Mirtle, for Love's; and for War's triumph, Bayes. 43 These, as rewards of Praise, about it grew; For lib'rall praise, from an abundant Minde, Does even the Conqueror of Fate subdue; Since Heav'n's good King is Captive to the Kinde. 44 Dark are all Thrones, to what this Temple seem'd; Whose Marble veines out-shin'd Heav'n's various Bow; And would (eclipsing all proud Rome esteem'd) To Northern Eyes, like Eastern Mornings, show. 45 From Paros Isle, was brought the Milkie white; From Sparta, came the Green, which cheers the view; From Araby, the blushing Onychite, And from the Misnian Hills, the deeper Blew. 46 The Arched Front did on vaste Pillars fall; Where all harmonious Instruments they spie Drawn out in Bosse; which from the Astrigall To the flat Frise, in apt resemblance lie. 47 Toss'd Cymballs (which the sullen Jewes admir'd) Were figur'd here, with all of ancient choice That joy did ere invent, or breath inspir'd, Or flying Fingers touch'd into a voice. 48 In Statute o're the Gate, God's Fav'rite-King (The Author of Celestial praise) did stand; His Quire (that did his sonnets set and Sing) In Niches rang'd, attended either Hand. 49 From these, old Greeks sweet Musick did improve; The Solemn Dorian did in Temples charm, The softer Lydian sooth'd to Bridal Love, And warlike Phrygian did to Battel warm! 50 They enter now, and with glad rev'rence saw Glory, too solid great to taste of pride; So sacred pleasant, as preserves an awe; Though jealous Priests, it neither praise nor hide, 51 Tapers and Lamps are not admitted here; Those, but with shaddowes, give false beauty grace; And this victorious glory can appear Unvayl'd before the Sun's Meridian Face: 52 Whose Eastern lustre rashly enters now; Where it his own mean Infancy displays; Where it does Man's chief obligation show, In what does most adorn the House of Praise; 53 The great Creation by bold Pencils drawn; Where a feign'd Curtain does our Eyes forbid, Till the Sun's Parent, Light, first seems to dawn From quiet Chaos, which that Curtain hid. 54 Then this all-rev'renc'd Sun (God's hasty Spark Struck out of Chaos, when he first struck Light) Flies to the Sphears, where first he found all dark, And kindled there th' unkindled Lamps of Night. 55 Then Motion, Nature's great Preservative, Tun'd order in this World, Life's restless Inn; Gave Tydes to Seas, and caus'd stretch'd Plants to live; Else Plants but seeds, and Seas but Lakes had bin. 56 But this Fourth Fiat, warming what was made, (For light ne'r warm'd, till it did motion get) The Picture fills the World with woody shade; To shew how Nature thrives by Motion's heat. 57 Then to those Woods the next quick Fiat brings The Feather'd kinde, where merrily they fed, As if their Hearts were lighter then their Wings; For yet no Cage was fram'd, nor Net was spred. 58 The same Fifth voice does Seas and Rivers Store; Then into Rivers Brooks the Painter powres, And Rivers into Seas; which (rich before) Return their gifts, to both, exhal'd in Show'rs. 59 This voice (whose swift dispatch in all it wrought, Seems to denote the Speaker was in haste, As if more worlds were framing in his thought) Adds to this world one Fiat, as the last. 60 Then strait an universal Herd appears; First gazing on each other in the shade; Wondring with levell'd Eyes, and lifted Eares, Then play, whilst yet their Tyrant is unmade. 61 And Man, the Painter now presents to view; Haughty without, and busie still within; Whom, when his Furr'd and Horned Subjects knew, Their sport is ended, and their fears begin. 62 But here (to cure this Tyrant's sullenness) The Painter has a new false Curtain drawn, Where, Beauty's hid Creation to express; From thence, harmless as light, he makes it dawn, 63 From thence breaks lov'ly forth, the World's first Maid; Her Breast, Love's Cradle, where Love quiet lies; Nought yet had seen so foule, to grow afraid, Nor gay, to make it cry with longing Eyes. 64 And thence, from stupid sleep, her Monarch steals; She wonders, till so vain his wonder growes, That it his feeble sov'raignty reveales; Her beauty then, his Manhood does depose. 65 Deep into shades the Painter leads them now; To hide their future deeds; then stormes does raise O're Heav'n's smooth face, because their life does grow Too black a story for the House of Praise. 66 A noble painted Vision next appears; Where all Heav'n's Frowns in distant prospect waste; And nought remains, but a short showre of Tears, Shed, by its pity, for Revenges past. 67 The World's one ship, from th' old to a new World bound; Fraighted with Life (chief of uncertain Trades!) After Five Moons at drift, lies now a ground; Where her frail Stowage, she in haste unlades. 68 On Persian Caucasus the Eight descend; And seem their trivial beings to deplore; Griev'd to begin this World in th' others end; And to behold wrack'd Nations on the Shore, 69 Each humbled thus, his Beasts led from aboard, As fellow Passengers, and Heirs to breath; Joynt Tennants to the World, he not their Lord; Such likeness have we in the Glass of Death. 70 Yet this humility begets their joy; And taught, that Heav'n (which fully sin surveys) Was partial where it did not quite destroy; So made the whole World's Dirge their song of praise. 71 This first redemption to another led, Kinder in deeds, and nobler in effects; That but a few did respit from the Dead, This all the Dead, from second Death protects. 72 And know, lost Nature! this resemblance was Thy franke Redeemer, in Ascension shown; When Hell he conquer'd in thy desp'rate cause; Hell which before, Man's common Grave was grown. 73 By Pencills this was exquisitely wrought; Rounded in all the Curious would behold; Where life Came out, and Met the Painters thought; The Force was tender, though the strokes were bold. 74 The holy Mourners, who this Lord of life Ascending saw, did seem with him to rise; So well the Painter drew their passions strife, To follow him with Bodies, as with Eyes. 75 This was the chief which in this Temple did By Pencils Rhetrique, to praise perswade; Yet to the living here, compar'd, seems hid; Who shine all painted Glory into shade. 76 Lord Astragon a Purple Mantle wore, Where Natures story was in Colours wrought; And though her ancient Text seem'd dark before, 'Tis in this pleasant Comment clearly taught. 77 Such various Flowry Wreaths th' Assembly weare, As shew'd them wisely proud of Nature's pride; Which so adorn'd them, that the coursest here Did seem a prosp'rous Bridegroom, or a Bride. 78 All shew'd as fresh, and faire, and innocent, As Virgins to their Lovers first survey; Joy'd as the Spring, when March his sighs has spent, And April's sweet rash Teares are dry'd by May. 79 And this confed'rate joy so swell'd each Breast, That joy would turn to pain without a vent; Therefore their voices Heav'n's renown exprest; Though Tongues ne'r reach, what Mindes so nobly meant. 80 Yet Musick here, shew'd all her Art's high worth; Whilst Virgin-Trebles, seem'd, with bashfull grace, To call the bolder marry'd Tenor forth; Whose Manly voice challeng'd the Giant Base. 81 To these the swift soft Instruments reply; Whisp'ring for help to those whom winds inspire; Whose lowder Notes, to Neighb'ring Forrests flie, And summon Nature's Voluntary Quire. 82 These Astragon, by secret skill had taught, To help, as if in artfull Consort bred; Who sung, as if by chance on him they thought, Whose care their careless merry Fathers Fed. 83 Hither, with borrow'd strength, Duke Gondibert Was brought, which now his rip'ning wounds allow; And high Heav'ns praise in musick of the heart, He inward sings, to pay a victor's vow. 84 Praise, is devotion fit for mighty Minds! The diff'ring World's agreeing Sacrifice; Where Heav'n divided Faiths united findes; But Pray'r in various discord upward flies. 85 For Pray'r the Ocean is, where diverslie Men steer their Course, each to a sev'ral Coast; Where all our int'rests so discordant be, That half beg windes by which the rest are lost. 86 By Penitence, when we our selves forsake, 'Tis but in wise design on pitious Heav'n; In Praise we nobly give, what God may take, And are without a Beggers blush forgiv'n. 87 Its utmost force, like Powder's, is unknown! And though weak Kings excess of Praise may fear, Yet when tis here, like Powder, dang'rous grown, Heav'n's Vault receives, what would the Palace tear. Canto the Seventh. The ARGUMENT. The Dukes wish'd health in doubtfull wounds assur'd; Who gets new wounds before the old are cur'd: Nature in Birtha, Art's weak help derides; Which strives to mend, what it at best but hides; Shewes Nature's courser works, so hid, more course; As Sin conceal'd, and unconfess'd, growes worse. 1 Let none our Lombard Author rudely blame, Who from the Story has thus long digrest; But for his righteous paines, may his fair Fame For ever travail, whilst his Ashes rest. 2 Ill could he leave Art's Shop of Nature's Store; Where she the hidden Soul would make more known; Though Common faith seeks Souls, which is no more Then long Opinion to Religion grown. 3 A while then let this sage Historian stay With Astragon, till he new wounds reveales, And such (though now the old are worn away) As Balm, nor juice of Pyrol, never heales. 4 To Astragon, Heav'n for succession gave One onely Pledge, and Birtha was her name; Whose Mother slept, where Flow'rs grew on her Grave; And she succeeded her in Face, and Fame. 5 Her beauty, Princes, durst not hope to use, Unless, like Poets, for their Morning Theam; And her Mindes beauty they would rather chuse, Which did the light in Beautie's Lanthorn seem. 6 She ne'r saw Courts, yet Courts could have undone VVith untaught looks, and an unpractis'd heart; Her Nets, the most prepar'd, could never shun; For Nature spread them in the scorn of Art. 7 She never had in busie Cities bin; Ne'r warm'd with hopes, nor ere allay'd with fears; Not seeing punishment, could guess no Sin; And Sin not seeing, ne'r had use of tears. 8 But here her Fathers's precepts gave her skill, Which with incessant business fill'd the Houres; In spring, she gather'd Blossoms for the Still, In Autumn, Berries; and in Summer, Flowers. 9 And as kinde Nature with calm diligence Her own free vertue silently imploys, Whilst she, unheard, does rip'ning growth dispence, So were her vertues busie without noise. 10 Whilst her great Mistris, Nature, thus she tends, The busie Houshold waites no less on her; By secret Law, each to her beauty bends; Though all her lowly Minde to that prefer. 11 Gracious and free, she breaks upon them all With Morning looks; and they when she does rise, Devoutly at her dawn in homage fall, And droop like Flowers, when Evening shuts her Eyes. 12 The sooty Chymist (who his sight does waste, Attending lesser Fires) she passing by, Broke his lov'd Lymbick, through enamour'd haste, And let, like common Dew, th' Elixer fly. 13 And here the grey Philosophers resort, Who all to her, like crafty Courtiers, bow; Hoping for secrets now in Nature's Court; Which only she (her fav'rite Maid) can know. 14 These, as the Lords of science, she respects, And with familiar Beams their age she chears; Yet all those civil formes seem but neglects To what she shewes, when Astragon apears. 15 For as she once from him her being took, She hourly takes her Law; reads with swift sight His will, even at the op'ning of his look, And shews, by haste, obedience her delight. 16 She makes (when she at distance to him bowes) His int'rest in her Mother's beauty known; For that's th' Original whence her Copy growes; And near Originalls, Copys are not shown. 17 And he, with dear regard, her gifts does weare Of Flowers, which she in mistick order ties; And with the sacrifice of many a teare Salutes her loyal Mother in her Eyes. 18 The just Historians, Birtha thus express; And tell how by her Syres Example taught, She serv'd the wounded Duke in Life's distress, And his fled Spirits back by Cordials brought. 19 Black melancholy Mists, that fed dispair Through wounds long rage, with sprinkled Vervin cleer'd; Strew'd Leaves of Willow to refresh the air, And with rich Fumes his sullen sences cheer'd. 20 He that had serv'd great Love with rev'rend heart, In these old wounds, worse wounds from him endures; For Love, makes Birtha shift with Death, his Dart, And she kills faster then her Father cures. 21 Her heedless innocence as little knew The wounds she gave, as those from Love she took; And Love lifts high each secret Shaft he drew; Which at their Stars he first in triumph shook! 22 Love he had lik'd, yet never lodg'd before; But findes him now a bold unquiet Guest; Who climbes to windowes, when we shut the Dore; And enter'd, never lets the Master rest. 23 So strange disorder, now he pines for health, Makes him conceal this Reveller with shame; She not the Robber knows, yet feeles the stealth; And never but in Songs had heard his name. 24 Yet then it was, when she did smile at Hearts Which Country Lovers wear in bleeding Seals; Ask'd where his pretty Godhead found such Darts, As make those wounds that onely Hymen heals. 25 And this, her ancient Maid, with sharp complaints Heard, and rebuk'd; shook her experienc'd Head; With teares besought her not to jest at Saints, Nor mock those Martyrs, Love had Captive led. 26 Nor think the pious Poets e're would waste So many Teares in Ink, to make Maids mourn, If injur'd Lovers had in ages paste The lucky Mirtle, more then Willow worn. 27 This grave rebuke, Officious Memory Presents to Birtha's thought; who now believ'd Such sighing Songs, as tell why Lovers dy, And prais'd their faith, who wept, when Poets griev'd. 28 She, full of inward questions, walks alone, To take her heart aside in secret Shade; But knocking at her Breast, it seem'd, or gone, Or by confed'racie was useless made; 29 Or else some stranger did usurp its room; One so remote, and new in ev'ry thought, As his behaviour shews him not at home; Nor the Guide sober that him thither brought. 30 Yet with this forraign Heart, she does begin To treat of Love, her most unstudy'd Theame; And like young Conscienc'd Casuists, thinks that sin, Which will by talk and practise lawfull seeme. 31 With open Eares, and ever-waking Eyes, And flying Feet, Love's fire she from the sight Of all her Maids does carry, as from Spys; Jealous, that what burns her, might give them light. 32 Beneath a Mirtle Covert she does spend In Maids weak wishes, her whole stock of thought; Fond Maids! who love, with Mindes fine stuff would mend, Which Nature purposely of Bodys wrought. 33 She fashions him she lov'd of Angels kinde; Such as in holy Story were imploy'd To the first Fathers, from th'Eternal Minde; And in short vision onely are injoy'd. 34 As Eagles then, when nearest Heav'n they flie, Of wild impossibles soon weary grow; Feeling their bodies finde no rest so high, And therefore pearch on Earthly things below: 35 So now she yields; him she an Angel deem'd Shall be a Man; the Name which Virgins fear; Yet the most harmless to a Maid he seem'd, That ever yet that fatal name did bear. 36 Soon her opinion of his hurtless heart, Affection turns to faith; and then loves fire To Heav'n, though bashfully, she does impart; And to her Mother in the Heav'nly Quire. 37 If I do love, (said she) that love (O Heav'n!) Your own Disciple, Nature, bred in me; Why should I hide the passion you have given, Or blush to shew effects which you decree? 38 And you, my alter'd Mother (grown above Great Nature, which you read, and reverenc'd here) Chide not such kindness, as you once call'd Love, When you as mortal as my Father were. 39 This said, her soul into her Breast retires! With Love's vain diligence of heart she dreams Her self into possession of desires, And trusts unanchor'd Hope in fleeting Streams. 40 Already thinks, the Duke her own spous'd Lord, Cur'd, and again from bloody Battel brought; Where all false Lovers perish'd by his sword; The true to her for his protection sought. 41 She thinks, how her imagin'd Spouse and she, So much from Heav'n, may by her vertues gain; That they by Time shall ne'r o'retaken be, No more then Time himself is overta'ne. 42 Or should he touch them as he by does pass, Heav'n's favour may repay their Summers gone, And he so mix their sand in a slow Glass, That they shall live, and not as Two, but One. 43 She thinks of Eden-life; and no rough winde, In their pacifique Sea shall wrinkles make; That still her lowliness shall keep him kinde, Her eares keep him asleep, her voice awake. 44 She thinks, if ever anger in him sway. (The Youthful Warrior's most excus'd disease) Such chance her Teares shall calm, as showres allay The accidental rage of Windes and Seas. 45 She thinks that Babes proceed from mingling Eyes, Or Heav'n from Neighbourhood increase allows, As Palm, and the Mamora fructefies; Or they are got, by closse exchanging vows. 46 But come they (as she hears) from Mothers pain, (Which by th' unlucky first-Maids longing, proves A lasting curse) yet that she will sustain, So they be like this Heav'nly Man she loves. 47 Thus to her self in day-dreams Birtha talkes; The Duke (whose wounds of war are healthful grown) To cure Love's wounds, seeks Birtha where she walks; Whose wandring Soul, seeks him to cure her own. 48 Yet when her solitude he did invade, Shame (which in Maids is unexperienc'd fear) Taught her to wish Night's help to make more shade, That Love (which Maids think guilt) might not appear 49 And she had fled him now, but that he came So like an aw'd, and conquer'd Enemy, That he did seem offenceless, as her shame; As if he but advanc'd for leave to fly. 50 First with a longing Sea-mans look he gaz'd, Who would ken Land, when Seas would him devour; Or like a fearfull Scout, who stands amaz'd To view the Foe, and multiplies their pow'r. 51 Then all the knowledge which her Father had He dreams in her, through purer Organs wrought; Whose Soul (since there more delicately clad) By lesser weight, more active was in thought. 52 And to that Soul thus spake, with tremb'ling voice; The world will be (O thou, the whole world's Maid!) Since now tis old enough to make wise choice, Taught by thy minde, and by thy beauty sway'd. 53 And I a needless part of it, unless You think me for the whole a Delegate, To treat for what they want of your excess, Vertue to serve the universal State. 54 Nature (our first example, and our Queen, Whose Court this is, and you her Minion Maid) The World thinks now, is in her sickness seen, And that her noble influence is decay'd. 55 And the Records so worn of her first Law, That Men, with Art's hard shifts, read what is good; Because your beauty many never saw, The Text by which your Minde is understood. 56 And I with the apostate world should grow, From sov'raigne Nature, a revolted Slave, But that my lucky wounds brought me to know, How with their cure my sicker minde to save. 57 A minde still dwelling idly in mine Eyes, Where it from outward pomp could ne'r abstain; But even in beauty, cost of Courts did prise, And Nature, unassisted, thought too plain. 58 Yet by your beauty now reform'd, I finde All other only currant by false light; Or but vain Visions of a feav'rish minde; Too slight to stand the test of waking sight. 59 And for my healthfull Minde (diseas'd before) My love I pay; a gift you may disdain, Since Love to you, Men give not, but restore; As Rivers to the Sea pay back the Rain. 60 Yet Eastern Kings, who all by birth possess, Take gifts, as gifts, from vassals of the Crown; So think in love, your property not less, By my kind giving what was first your own. 61 Lifted with Love, thus he with Lovers grace, And Love's wilde wonder, spake; and he was rais'd So much with rev'rence of this learned place, That still he fear'd to injure all he prais'd. 62 And she in love unpractis'd and unread, (But for some hints her Mistress, Nature, taught) Had it, till now, like grief with silence fed; For Love and grief are nourish'd best with thought. 63 But this closs Diet, Love endures not long; He must in sighs, or speech, take ayre abroad; And thus, with his Interpreter, her Tongue, He ventures forth, though like a stranger aw'd. 64 She said, those vertues now she highly needs, Which he so artfully in her does praise, To check (since vanity on praises feeds) That pride which his authentick words may raise. 65 That if her Pray'rs, or care, did ought restore Of absent health, in his bemoan'd distress; She beg'd, he would approve her duty more, And so commend her feeble vertue less. 66 That she the payment he of love would make Less understood, then yet the debt she knew; But coynes unknown, suspitiously we take, And debts, till manifest, are never due. 67 With bashfull Looks she sought him to retire, Least the sharp Ayre should his new health invade; And as she spake, she saw her rev'rend Syre Approach to seek her in her usual shade. 68 To whom with filial homage she does bow: The Duke did first at distant duty stand, But soon imbrac'd his knees; whil'st he more low Does bend to him, and then reach'd Birtha's hand. 69 Her Face, o'recast with thought, does soon betray Th' assembled spirits, which his Eyes detect By her pale look, as by the Milkie way Men first did the assembled Stars suspect. 70 Or as a Pris'ner, that in Prison pines, Still at the utmost window grieving lies; Even so her Soule, imprison'd, sadly shines, As if it watch'd for freedome at her Eyes! 71 This guides him to her Pulse, th' Alarum Bell, Which waits the insurrections of desire; And rings so fast, as if the Cittadell, Her newly conquer'd Breast, were all on fire! 72 Then on the Duke, he casts a short survay; Whose Veines, his Temples, with deep purple grace; Then Love's dispaire gives them a pale allay; And shifts the whole complexion of his Face. 73 Nature's wise Spy does onward with them walk; And findes, each in the midst of thinking starts; Breath'd short, and swiftly in disorder'd talk, To cool, beneath Love's Torrid Zone, their hearts. 74 When all these Symptomes he observ'd, he knowes From Alga, which is rooted deep in Seas, To the high Cedar that on Mountaines grows, No sov'raign hearb is found for their disease. 75 He would not Nature's eldest Law resist, As if wise Natures Law could be impure; But Birtha with indulgent Looks dismist, And means to counsel, what he cannot cure. 76 With mourning Gondibert he walks apart, To watch his Passions force; who seems to bear By silent grief, Two Tyrants o're his Heart, Great Love, and his inferior Tyrant, Fear. 77 But Astragon such kind inquiries made, Of all which to his Art's wise cares belong, As his sick silence he does now disswade, And midst Lov's fears, gives courage to his Tongue. 78 Then thus he spake with Love's humility; Have pitty Father! and since first so kinde, You would not let this worthless Body die, Vouchsafe more nobly to preserve my Minde! 79 A Minde so lately lucky, as it here Has Vertues Mirror found, which does reflect Such blemishes as Custom made it weare, But more authentick Nature does detect. 80 A Minde long sick of Monarchs vain disease; Not to be fill'd, because with glory fed; So busie it condemn'd even War of ease, And for their useless rest despis'd the Dead. 81 But since it here has Vertue quiet found, It thinks (though Storms were wish'd by it before) All sick at least at Sea, that scape undrown'd, Whom Glory serves as winde, to leave the shore. 82 All Vertue is to yours but fashion now, Religion, Art; Internals are all gon, Or outward turn'd, to satisfie with show, Not God, but his inferiour Eye, the Sun. 83 And yet, though vertue be as fashion sought, And now Religion rules by Art's prais'd skill; Fashion is Vertue's Mimmick, falsely taught; And Art, but Nature's Ape, which plays her ill. 84 To this blest House (great Nature's Court) all Courts Compar'd, are but dark Closets for retreat Of private Mindes, Battels but Childrens sports; And onely simple good, is solid great. 85 Let not the Minde, thus freed from Error's Night, (Since you repriev'd my Body from the Grave) Perish for being now in love with light, But let your Vertue, Vertue's Lover save. 86 Birtha I love; and who loves wisely so, Steps far tow'rds all which Vertue can attain; But if we perish, when tow'rds Heav'n we go, Then have I learnt that Vertue is in vain. 87 And now his Heart (extracted through his Eyes In Love's Elixer, Tears) does soon subdue Old Astragon; whose pity, though made wise With Love's false Essences, likes these as true. 88 The Duke he to a secret Bowre does lead, Where he his Youths first Story may attend; To guess, ere he will let his love proceed, By such a dawning, how his day will end. 89 For Vertue, though a rarely planted Flowre, Was in the seed by this wise Florist known; Who could foretell, even in her springing houre, What colours she shall wear when fully blown. Canto the Eighth. The ARGUMENT. Birtha her first unpractis'd Love bewailes, Whilst Gondibert on Astragon prevailes, By shewing, high Ambition is of use, And Glory in the Good needs no excuse. Goltho a grief to Ulfinore reveales, Whilst he a greater of his own conceales. 1 Birtha her griefs to her Apartment brought, Where all her Maids to Heav'n were us'd to raise Their voices, whilst their busie Fingers wrought To deck the Altar of the House of Praise. 2 But now she findes their Musick turn'd to care; Their looks allay'd, like beauty overworn; Silent and sad as with'ring Fav'rites are, Who for their sick indulgent Monarch mourn. 3 Thula (the eldest of this silenc'd Quire) When Birtha at this change astonish'd was, With hasty whisper, begg'd her to retire; And on her Knees, thus tells their sorrows cause. 4 Forgive me such experience, as too soon, Shew'd me unlucky Love; by which I guess How Maids are by their innocence undon, And trace those sorrows that them first oppress. 5 Forgive such passion as to speech perswades, And to my Tongue my observation brought; And then forgive my Tongue, which to your Maids, Too rashly carry'd, what Experience taught. 6 For since I saw this wounded stranger here Your inward musick still untun'd has been; You who could need no hope, have learnt to fear, And practis'd grief, e're you did know to Sin. 7 This being love, to Agatha I told; Did on her Tongue, as on still Death rely; But winged Love, she was too young to hold, And, wanton-like, let it to others fly. 8 Love, who in whisper scap'd, did publick grow; Which makes them now their time in silence waste; Makes their neglectected needles move so slow, And through their Eies, their Hearts dissolve so faste. 9 For oft, dire tales of Love has fill'd their Heads; And while they doubt you in that Tyrant's pow'r, The Spring (they think) may visit Woods and Meads, But scarce shall hear a Bird, or see a Flow'r. 10 Ah how (said Birtha) shall I dare confesse My griefs to thee, Love's rash, impatient Spie; Thou (Thula) who didst run to tell thy guesse, With secrets known, wilt to confession flie. 11 But if I love this Prince, and have in Heav'n Made any Friends by vowes, you need not fear He will make good the feature, Heav'n has giv'n; And be as harmless as his looks appear. 12 Yet I have heard, that Men whom Maids think kinde, Calm, as forgiven Saints, at their last Hour, Oft prove like Seas, inrag'd by ev'ry winde, And all to who their Bosoms trust, devour. 13 Howe're, Heav'n knows, (the witness of the Minde) My heart bears Men no malice, nor esteems Young Princes of the common cruel kinde, Nor Love so foul as it in Story seems. 14 Yet if this Prince brought Love, what e're it be, I must suspect, though I accuse it not; For since he came, my medc'nal Huswiffrie, Confections, and my Stills, are all forgot. 15 Blossoms in windes, Berries in Frosts may fall! And Flowers sink down in Rain! for I no more Shall Maids to woods, for early gath'rings call, Nor haste to Gardens to prevent a showre. 16 Then she retires; and now a lovely shame That she reveal'd so much, possess'd her Cheecks; In a dark Lanthorn she would bear Love's flame, To hide her self, whilst she her Lover seeks. 17 And to that Lover let our Song return: Whose Tale so well was to her Father told, As the Philosopher did seem to mourn That Youth had reach'd such worth, and he so old. 18 Yet Birtha was so precious in his Eies, And her dead Mother still so neer his mind That farther yet he thus his prudence tries, Ere such a Pledg he to his trust resign'd. 19 Whoe're (said he) in thy first story looks, Shall praise thy wise conversing with the Dead; For with the Dead he lives, who is with Books, And in the Camp (Death's moving Palace) bred. 20 Wise Youth, in Books and Batails early findes What thoughtless lazy Men perceive too late; Books shew the utmost conquests of our Mindes, Batails, the best of our lov'd Bodys fate. 21 Yet this great breeding, joyn'd with Kings high blood (Whose blood Ambition's feaver over-heats) May spoile digestion, which would else be good, As stomachs are deprav'd with highest Meats. 22 For though Books serve as Diet of the Minde; If Knowledg, early got, self vallew breeds, By false digestion it is turn'd to winde; And what should nourish, on the Eater feeds. 23 Though Wars great shape best educates the sight, And makes small soft'ning objects less our care; Yet War, when urg'd for glory, more then right, Shews Victors but authentick Murd'rers are. 24 And I may fear that your last Victories Where Glory's Toyles, and you will ill abide (Since with new Trophies still you fed your Eies) Those little objects which in Shades we hide. 25 Could you, in Fortunes smiles, foretell her frowns, Our old Foes slain, you would not hunt for new; But Victors, after wreaths, pretend to Crowns; And such think Rhodalind their Valor's due. 26 To this the noble Gondibert replies; Think not Ambition can my duty sway; I look on Rhodalind with Subjects Eies, Whom he that conquers, must in right obay. 27 And though I humanly have heretofore All beauty lik'd, I never lov'd till now; Nor think a Crown can raise his value more, To whom already Heav'n does Love allow. 28 Though, since I gave the Hunns their last defeat, I have the Lombards Ensignes onward led, Ambition kindled not this Victor's heat, But 'tis a warmth my Fathers prudence bred. 29 Who cast on more then Wolvish Man his Eie, Man's necessary hunger judg'd, and saw That caus'd not his devouring Maledy; But like a wanton whelp he loves to gnaw. 30 Man still is sick for pow'r, yet that disease Nature (whose Law is temp'rance) ne'r inspires; But 'tis a humor, which fond Man does please, A luxury, fruition only tires. 31 And as in persons, so in publick States, The lust of Pow'r provokes to cruel Warre; For wisest Senates it intoxicates, And makes them vain, as single persons are. 32 Men into Nations it did first divide; Whilst place, scarce distant, gives them diff'rent stiles; Rivers, whose breadth Inhabitants may stride, Parts them as much as Continents, and Isles. 33 On equal, smooth, and undistinguish'd Ground, The lust of pow'r does liberty impair, And limits by a Border and a Bound, What was before as passable as Air: 34 Whilst change of Languages oft breeds a warre, (A change which Fashion does as oft obtrude As womens dresse) and oft Complexions are, And diff'rent names, no less a cause of feud. 35 Since Men so causelesly themselves devour; (And hast'ning still, their else too hasty Fates, Act but continu'd Massacres for pow'r,) My Father ment to chastise Kings, and States. 36 To overcome the world, till but one Crown And universal Neighbourhood he saw; Till all were rich by that allyance grown; And want no more should be the cause of Law. 37 One Family the world was first design'd; And though some fighting Kings so sever'd are, That they must meet by help of Seas and Winde, Yet when they fight 'tis but a civil warre. 38 Nor could Religion's heat, if one rul'd all, To bloody War the unconcern'd allure; And hasten us from Earth, ere Age does call, Who are (alas) of Heav'n so little sure. 39 Religion, ne'r till divers Monarchys, Taught that almighty Heav'n needs Armys ayd; But with contentious Kings she now complies, Who seem, for their own cause, of God's afraid. 40 To joyn all sever'd Powr's (which is to end The cause of War) my Father onward fought; By War the Lombard Scepter to extend Till peace were forc'd, where it was slowly sought. 41 He lost in this attempt his last dear blood; And I (whom no remoteness can deterr, If what seems difficult, be great and good) Thought his Example could not make me err. 42 No place I merit in the Book of Fame! Whose leaves are by the Greeks and Romans fill'd; Yet I presume to boast, she knows my name, And she has heard to whom the Hunns did yield. 43 But let not what so needfully was done, Though still pursu'd, make you ambition feare; For could I force all Monarchys to one, That Universal Crown I would not weare. 44 He who does blindly soar at Rhodalind, Mounts like seel'd Doves, still higher from his ease; And in the lust of Empire he may finde, High Hope does better then Fruition please. 45 The Victor's solid recompence is rest; And 'tis unjust, that chiefs who pleasure shunn, Toyling in Youth, should be in age opprest With greater Toyles, by ruling what they wonn. 46 Here all reward of conquest I would finde; Leave shining Thrones for Birtha in a shade; With Nature's quiet wonders fill my minde; And praise her most, because she Birtha made. 47 Now Astragon (with joy suffic'd) perceiv'd How nobly Heav'n for Birtha did provide, Oft had he for her parted Mother griev'd, But can this joy, less then that sorrow hide. 48 With teares, bids Gondibert to Heav'n's Eie make All good within, as to the World he seems; And in gain'd Birtha then from Hymen take All youth can wish, and all his age esteems. 49 Strait to his lov'd Philosophers he hies, Who now at Nature's Councel busy are To trace new Lights, which some old Gazer spies; Whilst the Duke seeks more busily his Starre, 50 But in her search, he is by Goltho stay'd; Who in a close dark Covert foldes his Armes; His Eies with thoughts grow darker then that shade, Such thoughts as yielding Breasts with study warmes. 51 Fix'd to unheeded object is his Eie! His sences he calls in, as if t'improve By outward absence, inward extacie, Such as makes Prophets, or is made by Love. 52 Awake (said Gondibert) for now in vain Thou dream'st of Sov'raignty, and War's success; Hope, nought has left, which Worth should wish to gain; And all Ambition is but Hope's excess. 53 Bid all our Worthys to unarm, and rest! For they have nought to conquer worth their care; I have a Father's right in Birtha's Breast, And that's the peace for which the wise make warre. 54 At this starts Goltho, like some Army's Chief, Whom unintrench'd, a midnight Larum wakes; By pawse then gave disorder'd sence relief, And this reply with kindled passion makes. 55 What means my Prince to make so low a boast, Whose merit may aspire to Rhodalind? For who could Birtha miss if she were lost, That shall by worth the others treasure find? 56 When your high blood, and conquests shall submit To such mean joys, in this unminded shade, Let Courts, without Heav'n's Lamps, in darkness sit, And War become the lowly Shepheard's Trade. 57 Birtha, (a harmless Country Ornament!) May be his Bride, that's born himself to serve; But you must pay that blood your Army spent; And wed that Empire which our wounds deserve. 58 This brought the Duke's swift anger to his Eies; Which his consid'rate Heart rebuk'd as faste; He Goltho chid, in that he nought replies; Leaves him, and Birtha seeks with Lovers haste. 59 Now Goltho mourns, yet not that Birtha's fair; Or that the Duke shuns Empire for a Bride; But that himself must joyn love to despair; Himself who loves her, and his love must hide. 60 He curs'd that him the wounded hither brought From Oswald's Field, where though he wounds did scape In tempting Death, and here no danger sought, Yet here meet worse then Death in Beauty's shape. 61 He was unus'd to love, as bred in warres; And not till now for beauty leasure had; Yet bore Love's load, as Youth bears other Cares; Till new dispair makes Love's old weight too sad. 62 But Ulfinore, does hither aptly come, His second Breast, in whom his griefs excesse He may ebb out, where they o'reflow at home; Such griefs, as thus in Throngs for utt'rance press. 63 Forgive me that so falsly am thy Friend! No more our Hearts for kindness shall contest; Since mine I hourly on another spend, And now imbrace thee with an empty Brest. 64 Yet pard'ning me, you cancel Natur's fault; Who walks with her first force in Birtha's shape; And when she spreads the Net to have us caught, It were in youth presumption to escape. 65 When Birtha's grief so comely did appear. Whilst she beheld our wounded Duk's distresse; Then first my alter'd Heart began to fear, Least too much Love should friendship dispossesse; 66 But this whilst Ulfinore with sorrow hears, Him Goltho's busier sorrow little heeds; And though he could replie in sighs and tears, Yet governs both, and Goltho thus proceeds. 67 To Love's new dangers I have gone unarm'd; I lack'd experience why to be affraid; Was too unlearn'd to read whom Love had harm'd; But have his will as Nature's law obay'd. 68 Th' obedient and defencelesse, sure, no law Afflicts, for law is their defence, and pow'r; Yet me, Loves sheep, whom rigour needs not aw, Wolf-Love, because defencelesse, does devour: 69 Gives me not time to perish by degrees, But with dispair does me at once destroy; For none who Gondibert a Lover sees, Thinks he would love, but where he may enjoy. 70 Birtha he loves; and I from Birtha fear Death that in rougher Figure I despise! This Ulfinore did with distemper hear, Yet with dissembled temp'rance thus replies. 71 Ah Goltho! who Love's Feaver can asswage? For though familiar seem that old disease; Yet like Religion's fit, when People rage, Few cure those evils which the Patient please. 72 Natures Religion, Love, is still perverse; And no commerce with cold discretion hath, For if Discretion speak when Love is fierce, 'Tis wav'd by Love, as Reason is by Faith. 73 As Gondibert left Goltho when he heard His Saint profan'd, as if some Plague were nie; So Goltho now leaves Ulfinore, and fear'd To share such veng'ance, if he did not flie. 74 How each at home o're-rates his miserie, And thinks that all are musical abroad, Unfetter'd as the Windes, whilst onely he Of all the glad and licens'd world is aw'd? 75 And as Cag'd Birds are by the Fowler set To call in more, whilst those that taken be, May think (though they are Pris'ners in the Net) Th' incag'd, because they sing, sometimes are free: 76 So Goltho (who by Ulfinore was brought Here where he first Love's dangers did perceive In Beauty's Field) thinks though himself was caught, Th' inviter safe, because not heard to grieve. 77 But Ulfinore (whom Neighbourhood led here) Impressions took before from Birtha's sight; Ideas which in silence hidden were, As Heav'n's designes before the birth of Light. 78 This from his Father Ulfin he did hide, Who, strict to Youth, would not permit the best Reward of worth, the Bosome of a Bride, Should be but after Vertuous toyles possest. 79 For Ulfinore (in blooming honor yet) Though he had learnt the count'nance of the Foe, And though his courage could dull Armys whet, The care o're Crouds, nor Conduct could not know; 80 Nor varie Batails shapes in the Foes view; But now in forraigne Fields meanes to improve His early Arts, to what his Father knew, That merit so might get him leave to love. 81 Till then, check'd passion, shall not venture forth: And now retires with a disorder'd Heart; Griev'd, least his Rival should by early'r worth Get Love's reward, ere he can gain desert. 82 But stop we here, like those who day-light lack; Or as misguided Travailers that rove, Oft finde their way by going somewhat back; So let's return, thou ill Conductor Love! 83 Thy little wanton Godhead as my Guide I have attended many'a winter night; To seek whom Time for honor's sake would hide, Since in mine age sought by a wasted light, 84 But ere my remnant of Life's Lamp be spent, Whilst I in Lab'rinths stray amongst the Dead; I mean to recollect the paths I went, And judge from thence the steps I am to tread. 85 Thy walk (though as a common Deitie The Croud does follow thee) misterious grows For Rhodalind may now closs Mourner die, Since Gondibert, too late, her sorrow knows. 86 Young Hurgonil above dear light prefers Calm Orna, who his highest Love outloves; Yet envious Clouds in Lombard Registers O'recast their Morn, what e're their Evening proves. 87 For fatal Laura, trusty Tybalt pines; For haughty Gartha, subtle Hermegild; Whilst she her beauty, youth, and birth declines; And as to Fate, does to Ambition yield. 88 Great Gondibert, to bashful Birtha bends; Whom she adores like Vertue in a Throne; Whilst Ulfinore and Goltho (late vow'd Friends By him) are now his Rivals, and their owne. 89 Through ways thus intricate to Lovers Urnes, Thou lead'st me Love, to shew thy Trophies past; Where Time (less cruel then thy Godhead) mournes In ruines which thy pride would have to last. 90 Where I on Lombard Monuments have read Old Lovers names, and their fam'd Ashes spy'd; But less can learn by knowing they are dead, And such their Tombes; then how they liv'd, and dy'd. 91 To Paphos flie! and leave me sullen here! This Lamp shall light me to Records which give To future Youth, so just a cause of feare, That it will Valor seem to dare to live! The End of the Second Book. THE THIRD Written by the Author during his imprisonment. BOOK. Canto the First. The ARGUMENT. The People, left by Gartha, leave to mourn; And worship Hermegild for her return. The wounded Hurgonil by Orna cur'd; Their loyal loves by marriage plight assur'd. In Laura's hasty change, Love's pow'r appears, And Tybalt seeks the kindness which he fears. 1 When sad Verona saw in Gartha's shape Departed Peace brought back, the Court they prais'd; And seem'd so joy'd as Cities which escape A siege, that by their own brave Sallies rais'd. 2 And Hermegild, to make her triumph long, Through all the streets his Chariot slowly drove; Whilst she endures the kindness of the Throng, Though rude, as was their rage, is now their love. 3 On Hermegild (so longingly desir'd From Hubert's Camp) with Childish Eyes they gaze; They worship now, what late they but admir'd, And all his Arts to mighty Magick raise. 4 On both they such abundant Blessings throw, As if those num'rous Priests who here reside, (Loath to out-live this joy) assembled now In haste to bless the Laytie e're they dyde. 5 Thus dignify'd, and Crown'd through all the Streets To Court they come; where them wise Aribert Not weakly with a publick passion meets; But in his open'd Face conceal'd his heart. 6 With mod'rate joy he took this Pledge of Peace, Because great joys infer to judging eyes The minde distress'd before; and in distress, Thrones, which are jealous Forts, think all are Spies. 7 Yet, by degrees, a Soul delighted showes To Gartha, whom he leads to Rhodalind; And soon to Hermegild as artless grows As Maids, and like successful Lovers kind. 8 And Rhodalind, though bred to daily sight Of Courts feign'd Faces, and pretended hearts, (In which disguises Courts take no delight, But little mischiefs shun by little Arts.) 9 She, when she Gartha saw, no kindness feign'd; But faithfully her former rage excus'd; For now she others sorrows entertain'd, As if to love, a Maid's first sorrow us'd, 10 Yet did her first with cautious gladness meet; Then soon from grave respect to fondness grew; To kisses in their taste and odour sweet, As Hybla Hony, or Arabian Dew. 11 And Gartha like an Eastern Monarch's Bride, This publick love with bashful homage took; For she had learn'd from Hermegild to hide A rising Heart, behind a falling Look. 12 Thus, mask'd with meekness, she does much intreat A pardon for that Storm her sorrow rais'd; Which Rhodalind more sues she would forget, Unless to have so just a sorrow prais'd. 13 Soon is this joy through all the Court dispers'd; So high they value peace, who daily are In Prides invasions, private faction, vers'd; The small, but fruitful seed of publick warre. 14 Whilst thus sweet Peace had others joys assur'd, Orna with hopes of sweeter Love was pleas'd; For of war's wounds brave Hurgonil was cur'd; And those of love, which deeper reach'd, were eas'd. 15 In both these cures her Sov'raign help appears, Since as her double Patient he receiv'd For bloody wounds, Balm, from her precious tears, And bloodless wounds of love her vowes reliev'd. 16 She let no med'cinal Flow'r in quiet grow, No Art lie hid, nor Artist ease his thought, No Fane be shut, no Priest from Altars goe, Nor in Heav'n's Quire no Saint remain unsought, 17 Nor more her Eyes could ease of sleep esteem Then sleep can the world's Eye, the Sun, conceal; Nor breath'd she but in vows to Heav'n, or him, Till Heav'n, and she, his diff'rent wounds did heal. 18 But now she needs those ayds she did dispence; For scarce her cures were on him perfect grown, E're shame afflicts her for that diligence, Which Love had in her fits of pitty shown, 19 When she (though made of cautious bashfulness) Whilst him in wounds a smarting Feaver burn'd, Invok'd remotest aydes to his redress, And with a loud ungovern'd kindness mourn'd. 20 When o're him then, whilst parting life She ru'd, Her kisses faster (though unknown before) Then Blossomes fall on parting Spring, she strew'd; Then Blossomes sweeter, and in number more. 21 But now when from her busie Maid she knew How wildly Grief had led her Love abroad, Unmask'd to all, she her own Pris'ner grew; By shame, a Virgin's Native Conscience, aw'd. 22 With undirected Eyes which careless rove, With thoughts too singly to her self confin'd, She blushing, starts at her remember'd love, And grieves the world had Eyes, when that was blind. 23 Sad darkness, which does other Virgins fright, Now boldly and alone, she entertain'd; And shuns her Lover, like the Traytor, light, Till he her curtains drew, and thus complain'd. 24 Why, bashfull Maid, will you your beauty hide Because your fairer Mind, your Love, is known? So Jewellers conceal with artfull pride Their second wealth, after the best is shown. 25 In pitty's passion you unvail'd your Minde; Let him not fall, whom you did help to climbe; Nor seem by being bashful, so unkinde As if you think your pitty was a crime. 26 O useless shame! Officious bashfulness! Vertues vain signe, which onely there appears Where Vertue grows erroneous by excess, And shapes more sins, then frighted Conscience fears. 27 Your Blushes, which to meer complexion grow, You must as nature, not as vertue own; And for your open'd Love, you but blush so As guiltless Roses blush that they are blown. 28 As well the Morn (whose Essence Poets made, And gave her bashful Eyes) we may believe Does blush for what she sees through Nights thin shade, As that you can for love discover'd grieve. 29 Arise! and all the Flowers of ev'ry Mead (Which weeping through your Stills my health restor'd) Bring to the Temple to adorn your Head, And there where you did worship, be ador'd. 30 This with a low regard (but voice rais'd high By joys of Love) he spake; and not less kinde Was now (ent'ring with native harmony, Like forward spring) the blooming Rhodalind. 31 Like Summer, goodly Gartha, fully blown; Laura, like Autumn, with as ripe a look; But shew'd, by some chill griefs, her Sun was gon, Arnold, from whom she Life's short glory took. 32 Like Winter, Hermegild; yet not so gray And cold, but that his fashion seem'd to boast, That even weak Winter is allow'd some day, And the Ayre cleer, and healthfull in a Frost. 33 All these, and Tybalt too (unless a Spy He be, watching who thrives in Laura's sight) Came hither, as in kinde conspiracy, To hasten Orna to her marriage plight. 34 And now the Priests prepare for this high vow All Rites, that to their Lawes can add a grace; To which the sequent knot they not allow, Till a spent Morn recovers all her Face. 35 And now the Streets like Summer Meads appear! For with sweet strewings Maids left Gardens bare, As Lovers wish their sweeter Bosomes were, When hid unkindly by dishevel'd Haire. 36 And Orna now (importun'd to possess Her long wish'd joys) breaks through her blushes so As the fair Morn breaks through her rosyness; And from a like guilt did their blushes grow. 37 She thinks her Love's high sickness now appears A fit so weak, as does no med'cine need; So soon society can cure those feares On which the Coward, Solitude, does feed. 38 They with united joy blest Hurgonil And Orna to the sacred Temple bring; Whilst all the Court in triumph shew their Skill, As if long bred by a triumphant King. 39 Such dayes of joy, before the marriage day, The Lombards long by custome had embrac't; Custom, which all, rather then Law obey, For Lawes by force, Customes, by pleasure last. 40 And wisely Ancients by this needfull snare Of gilded joys, did hide such bitterness As most in marriage swallow with that care, Which bashfully the wise will ne'r confess. 41 'Tis Statesmens musick, who States Fowlers be, And singing Birds, to catch the wilder, set; So bring in more to tame society; For wedlock, to the wilde, is the States Net. 42 And this loud joy, before the marriage Rites, Like Battails Musick which to fights prepare, Many to strife and sad success invites; For marriage is too oft but civil Warr. 43 A truth too amply known to those who read Great Hymen's Roles; though he from Lovers Eyes Hides his most Tragick stories of the Dead, Least all, like Goths, should 'gainst his Temples rise. 44 And thou (what ere thou art, who dost perchance With a hot Reader's haste, this Song pursue) Mayst finde, too soon, thou dost too far advance, And wish it all unread, or else untrue. 45 For it is sung (though by a mourning voice) That in the Ides before these Lovers had, With Hymens publick hand, confirm'd their choice, A cruel practise did their peace invade. 46 For Hermegild, too studiously foresaw The Counts allyance with the Duke's high blood, Might from the Lombards such affection draw, As could by Hubert never be withstood. 47 And he in haste with Gartha does retire, Where thus his Breast he opens to prevent, That Hymen's hallow'd Torch may not take fire, When all these lesser lights of joy are spent. 48 High Heaven (from whose best Lights your beauty grows, Born high, as highest Mindes) preserve you still From such, who then appear resistless Foes, When they allyance joyn to Armes and Skill! 49 Most by conjuction Planets harmfull are; So Rivers joyning overflow the Land, And Forces joyn'd make that destructive warre, Which else our common conduct may withstand. 50 Their Knees to Hurgonil the People bow And worship Orna in her Brothers right; They must be sever'd, or like Palms will grow, Which planted near, out-climbe their native height. 51 As Windes, whose violence out-does all art, Act all unseen; so we as secretly These Branches of that Cedar Gondibert Must force till his deep Root in rising dy. 52 If we make noise whilst our deep workings last, Such rumour through thick Towns unheeded flies, As winds through woods, and we (our great work past) Like winds will silence Tongues, and scape from Eyes. 53 E're this dark lesson she was clearer taught, His enter'd Slaves place at her rev'renc'd Feet A spacious Cabinet, with all things fraught, Which seem'd for wearing artful, rich, and sweet. 54 With leisurely delight, she by degrees Lifts ev'ry Till, does ev'ry Drawer draw; But nought which to her Sex belongs she sees; And for the Male all nice adornments saw. 55 This seem'd to breed some strangeness in her Eyes; Which like a wanton wonder there began; But strait she in the Lower Closet spies Th' accomplish'd dress, and Garments of a Man. 56 Then starting, she her Hand shrunk nicely back; As if she had been stung, or that she fear'd This Garment was the skin of that old Snake. Which at the fatal Tree like Man appear'd. 57 Th' ambitious Maid at scornfull distance stood; And bravely seem'd of Love's low vices free; Though vicious in her minde, not in her blood: Ambition is the Mindes immodestie! 58 He knew great mindes disorder'd by mistake, Defend through pride, the errors they repent; And with a Lovers fearfulness he spake Thus humbly, that extremes he might prevent. 59 How ill (delightfull Maid!) shall I deserve My Life's last flame, fed by your beauty's fire, If I shall vex your vertues, that preserve Others weak vertues, which would else expire. 60 How, more then death, shall I my life despise, When your fear'd frowns, make me your service fear; When I scarce dare to say, that the disguise You shrink to see, you must vouchsafe to wear. 61 So rude a Law your int'rest will impose: And solid int'rest must not yield to shame: Vain shame, which fears you should such honor lose As lasts but by intelligence with Fame. 62 Number, which makes opinion Law, can turn This shape to fashion, which you scorn to use, Because not by your Sex as fashion worn; And fashion is but that which Numbers chuse, 63 If you approve what Numbers lawful think, Be bold, for Number cancels bashfulness; Extremes, from which a King would blushing shrink, Unblushing Senates act as no excess. 64 Thus he his thoughts (the picture of his minde) By a dark Vayle to sudden sight deny'd; That she might prise, what seem'd so hard to finde; For Curtains promise worth in what they hide. 65 He said her Manhood would not strange appear In Court, where all the fashion is disguise; Where Masquerades are serious all the year; None known but strangers, nor secure but Spies. 66 All rules he reads of living great in Courts; Which some the Art of wise dissembling call; For Pow'r (born to have Foes) much weight supports By their false strength who thrust to make it fall. 67 He bids her wear her beauty free as light; By Eares as open be to all endeer'd; For the unthinking Croud judge by their sight; And seem half eas'd, when they are fully heard. 68 He shuts her Breast even from familiar Eyes; For he who secrets (Pow'r's chief Treasure) spends To purchase Friendship, friendship dearly buys: Since Pow'r seeks great Confed'rates, more then Friends. 69 And now with Councels more particular, He taught her how to wear tow'rdes Rhodalind Her looks; which of the Minde false pictures are; And then how Orna may believe her kinde. 70 How Laura too may be (whose practis'd Eyes Can more detect the shape of forward love) By treaty caught, though not by a surprise; Whose aid would precious to her faction prove. 71 But here he ends his Lecture, for he spy'd (Adorn'd, as if to grace Magnifique Feasts) Bright Rhodalind, with the elected Bride; And with the Bride, all her selected Guests. 72 They Gartha in their civil pity sought; Whom they in midst of triumphs mist, and feare Least her full Breast (with Huberts sorrows fraught) She, like a Mourner, came to empty here. 73 But she, and Hermegild, are wilde with hast, As Traytors are whom Visitants surprise; Decyph'ring that which fearfully they cast In some dark place, where viler Treason lies. 74 So open they the fatal Cabinet, To shut things slighter with the Consequent; Then soon their rally'd looks in posture set; And boldly with them to their triumphs went. 75 Tybalt, who Laura gravely ever led, With ceaseless whispers laggs behinde the Train; Trys, since her wary Governour is dead, How the fair Fort he may by Treaty gain. 76 For now unhappy Arnold she forsakes; Yet is he blest that she does various prove, When his spent heart for no unkindness akes; Since from the light as sever'd as from Love. 77 Yet as in storms and sickness newly gon, Some Clouds a while, and strokes of faintness last; So, in her brow, so much of grief is shown, As shews a Tempest, or a sickness past. 78 But him no more with such sad Eyes she seeks, As even at Feasts would make old Tyrants weep; Nor more attempts to wake him with such shreeks, As threatned all where Death's deaf Pris'ners sleep. 79 Hugo and him, as Leaders now she names, Not much as Lovers does their fame approve; Nor her own fate, but chance of battel blames; As if they dy'd for honor, not for love. 80 This Tybalt saw, and findes that the turn'd Stream Came fairly flowing to refresh his heart; Yet could he not forget the kinde esteem She lately had of Arnold's high desert. 81 Nor does it often scape his memory, How gravely he had vowd, that if her Eyes, After such Showres of Love, were quickly drie, He would them more then Lamps in Tombs despise. 82 And whilst he watch'd like an industrious Spy Her Sexes changes, and revolts of youth; He still reviv'd this vow as solemnly, As Senates Count'nance Laws, or Synods, Truth. 83 But Men are frail, more Glass then Women are! Tybalt, who with a stay'd judicious heart Would love, grows vain amidst his gravest care: Love free by nature, scorns the Bonds of Art! 84 Laura (whose Fort he by approach would gain) With a weak sigh blows up his Mine, and Smiles; Gives fire but with her Eye, and he is slain; Or treats, and with a whisper him beguiles. 85 Nor force of Arms or Arts (O Love!) endures Thy mightyness; and since we must discern Diseases fully e're we study cures; And our own force by others weakness learn; 86 Let me to Courts and Camps thy Agent be, Where all their weakness and diseases spring From their not knowing, and not hon'ring thee In those, who Nature in thy triumphs sing. Canto the Second. The ARGUMENT. Whilst Birtha and the Duke their joyes persue In conqu'ring Love, Fate does them both subdue With triumphs, which from Court young Orgo brought; And have in Goltho greater triumphs wrought: Whose hopes the quiet Ulfinore does bear With patience feign'd, and with a hidden fear. 1 The prosp'rous Gondibert from Birtha gains All bashful plights a Maids first bounties give; Fast vows, which binde Love's Captives more then chains, Yet free Love's Saints in chosen bondage live. 2 Few were the dayes, and swiftly seem'd to waste, Which thus he in his mindes fruition spent; And least some envious Cloud should overcast His Love's fair Morn, oft to his Camp he sent; 3 To Bergamo, where still intrenched were Those Youth, whom first his Father's Army bred; Who ill the rumor of his wounds did bear, Though he that gave them, of his own be dead. 4 And worse those haughty threat'nings they abhor, Which Fame from Brescia's ancient Fighters brought; Vain Fame, the Peoples trusted Orator, Whose speech (too fluent) their mistakes has wrought. 5 Oft Goltho with his temp'rate Councels went, To quench whom Fame to dang'rous fury warm'd; Till temp'rately his dangers they resent, And think him safest in their patience arm'd. 6 And safe now is his love, as love could be, If all the World like old Arcadia were; Honor the Monarch, and all Lovers free From jealousie, as safety is from fear. 7 And Birtha's heart does to his civil Breast As much for ease and peace, as safety come; For there 'tis serv'd and treated as a Guest, But watch'd, and taught, and often chid at home. 8 Like great and good Confed'rates, whose designe Invades not others but secures their own, So they in just and vertuous hopes combine, And are, like new Confed'rates, busie grown. 9 With whisper earnest, and now grave with thought; They walk consulting, standing they debate; And then seek shades, where they in vaine are sought By servants who intrude and think they waite. 10 In this great League, their most important care Was to dispatch their Rites; yet so provide, That all the Court might think them free as ayre, When fast as faith, they were by Hymen ty'd. 11 For if the King (said he) our love surprise, His stormy rage will it rebellion call; Who claims to chuse the Brides of his Allys; And in that storm our joys in blossome fall. 12 Our love, your cautious Father onely knowes (On whose safe prudence, Senates may depend) And Goltho, who to time few reck'nings owes, Yet can discharge all duties of a Friend. 13 Such was his minde, and hers (more busy) shows That bonds of love doe make her longer fast Then Hymen's knot, as plain Religion does, Longer then Rites (Religion's fashions) last. 14 That her discretion somewhat does appeare, Since she can Love, her minds chief beauty, hide Which never farther went then Thula's Eare, Who had (alass) but for that secret di'de. 15 That she already had disguises fram'd, And sought out Caves where she might closs reside As being, nor unwilling nor asham'd To live his Captive, so she die his Bride. 16 Full of themselves, delight them onward leads, Where in the Front was to remoter view Exalted Hills, and neerer prostrate Meads, With Forrests flanck'd, where shade to darkness 17 Beneath that shade, Two Rivers slily steal, Through narrow walks, to vvider Adice, VVho swallows both, till proudly she does swell, And hasts to shew her beauty to the Sea. 18 And here, whilst forth he sends his ranging Eie, Orgo he spies; who plies the spur so fast, As if with nevves of Vict'ry he vvould flie To leave svvift Fame behinde him by his haste. 19 If (said the Duke) because this Boy is come I second gladness shew, doe not suppose I spread my Breast to give new Comforts roome, That were to welcome rain where Nylus flowes. 20 Though the unripe appearance of a Page For weighty trust, may render him too weak, Yet this is he, who more then cautious Age, Or like calm Death, will bury what we speak. 21 This, Birtha, is the Boy, whose skilless face Is safe from jealousie of oldest spies; In whom, by whisper, we from distant place May meet, or wink our meaning to his Eyes. 22 More had he said to gain him her esteem, But Orgo enters speechless with his Speed; And by his looks more full of haste did seem, Then when his spurs provok'd his flying steed. 23 And with his first recover'd breath he cryes; Hayle my lov'd Lord; whom Fame does vallue so, That when she swift with your successes flies, She feares to wrong the World in being slow. 24 I bring you more then tasts of Fortune's love, Yet am afraid I err, in having dar'd To think her favours could your gladness move; Who have more worth then Fortune can reward. 25 The Duke, with smiles, forewarns his hasty Tongue; As loath he should proceed in telling more; Kindly afraid to do his kindness wrong, By hearing what he thought he knew before. 26 Thy diligence (said he) is high desert; It does in youth supply defects of skil; And is of duty the most useful part; Yet art thou now but slow to Hurgonil. 27 Who hither by the Moons imperfect light Came and return'd, without the help of day, To tell me he has Orna's Virgin plight, And that their nuptials for my presence stay. 28 Orgo reply'd, though that a triumph be Where all false Lovers are, like savage Kings, Led Captive after Love's great Victory, It does but promise what your triumph brings. 29 It was the Eve to this your Holy-day! And now Verona Mistriss does appear Of Lombardy; and all the Flowers which May E're wore, does as the Countrie's favours wear. 30 The weary Eccho from the Hills makes haste; Vex'd that the Bells still call for her replies When they so many are, and ring so faste; Yet oft are silenc'd by the Peoples cries: 31 Who send to Heav'n the name of Rhodalind, And then Duke Gondibert as high they raise, To both with all their publick passion kinde, If kindness shine in wishes and in praise. 32 The King this day made your adoption known, Proclaim'd you to the Empire next ally'd, As heir to all his Conquests and his Crown, For royal Rhodalind must be your Bride. 33 Not all the dangers valor findes in war, Love meets in Courts, or pride to Courts procures, When sick with peace they hot in faction are, Can make such fears as now the Duke endures. 34 Nor all those fears which ev'ry Maid has found, On whose first Guards, Love by surprises steals, (Whose sightless Arrow makes a cureless wound) Are like to this which doubtful Birtha feels. 35 He from his looks wild wonder strives to chace; Strives more to teach his Manhood to resist Death in her Eyes; and then with all the grace Of seeming pleasure, Orgo he dismist. 36 And Orgo being gone, low as her knees Could fall, she fell; and soon he bends as low With weight of heart; griev'd that no Grave he sees, To sink, where love no more can sorrow know. 37 Her sighs as showrs lay windes, are calm'd with tears; And parting life seems stay'd awhile to take A civil leave, whilst her pale visage wears A cleerer Sky, and thus she weeping spake. 38 Since such a Prince has forfeited his pow'r, Heav'n give me leave to make my duty less, Let me my vows, as sudden oathes abhor, Which did my passion, not my truth express. 39 Yet yours I would not think were counterfeit, But rather ill and rashly understood; For 'tis impossible I can forget So soon, that once you fatally were good. 40 Though cruel now as Beasts where they have pow'r; Chusing, like them, to make the vveakest bleed; For vveakness soon invites you to devour, And a submission gives you ease to feed. 41 To fighting Fields, send all your honor back, To Courts your dang'rous Tongue and civil shape, That Country Maids may Men no more mistake, Nor seek dark Death, that they may Love escape. 42 Now soon to Heav'n her Soul had found the way, (For there it oft had been in pray'r and praise) But that his vows did life with loudness stay, And life's warm help did soon her Body raise. 43 And now he gently leads her; for no more He lets th' unhallow'd Ground a faln Flowre wear, Sweeter then Nature's Bosome ever wore; And now these vows sends kindly to her Ear. 44 If (Birtha) I am false, think none to blame For thinking Truth (by which the Soul subsists) No farther to be found then in the name; Think humane kind betraid even by their Priests. 45 Think all my Sex so vile, that you may chide Those Maids who to your Mothers Nuptials ran; And praise your Mother who so early dy'de, Remembring whom she marry'd was a Man. 46 This great Court miracle you strait receive From Orgo, and your faith the whole allows; Why since you Orgo's words so soon believe Will you less civilly suspect my vowes? 47 My Vowes, which want the Temples seal, will binde (Though private kept) surer then publick Laws; For Laws but force the Body, but my Minde Your Vertue Councels, whilst your beauty draws. 48 Thus spake he, but his mourning looks did more Attest his grief, and fear does hers renew; Now losing (were he lost) more then before, For then she fear'd him false, now thinks him true. 49 As sick Physitians seldome their own Art Dare trust, to cure their own disease, so these Were to themselves quite useless when apart; Yet by consult, each can the other ease. 50 But from themselves they now diverted stood; For Orgo's Newes (which need not borrow wings, Since Orgo for his Lord believ'd it good) To Astragon the joyful Houshold brings. 51 But Astragon, with a judicious thought, This days glad news took in the dire portent; A day which mourning Nights to Birtha brought; And with that fear, in search of Birtha went. 52 And here he findes her in her Lovers Eyes, And him in hers; both more afflicted grown At his approach; for each his sorrow spies; Who thus would counsel theirs, and hide his own. 53 Though much this fatall joy to anger moves; Yet reasons aydes shall anger's force subdue; I will not chide you for your hasty Loves, Nor ever doubt (great Prince) that yours is true. 54 In chiding Love, because he hasty was, Or urging errors, which his swiftness brings, I finde effects, but dare not tax the cause; For Poets were inspir'd, who gave him wings. 55 When low I digg, where desart-Rivers run, Dive deep in Seas, through Forrests follow windes, Or reach with Optick Tubes the ragged Moon, My sight no cause of Love's swift motion findes. 56 Love's fatall haste, in yours, I will not blame, Because I know not why his Wings were giv'n; Nor doubt him true, not knowing whence he came, Nor Birtha chide, who thought you came from Heav'n. 57 If you lay snares, we err when we escape; Since evil practise learns Men to suspect Where falshood is, and in your noble shape, We should by finding it, our skill detect. 58 Yet both your griefs I'le chide, as ignorance; Call you unthankful; for your great griefs show That Heav'n has never us'd you to mischance, Yet rudely you repine to feel it now. 59 If your contextures be so weak, and nice, Weep that this stormy world you ever knew; You are not in those Calmes of Paradice, Where slender Flowers as safe as Cedars grew. 60 This which your Youth calls grief, was frowardness In flatter'd Infancy, and as you beare Unkindly now amidst Youth's joys distress, So then, unless still rock'd you froward were. 61 Griefs conflicts gave these Haires their silver shine; (Torne Ensignes which victorious Age adorne) Youth is a Dress too garish and too fine To be in foule tempestuous weather worne. 62 Griefs want of use does dang'rous weakness make; But we by use of Burdens are made strong; And in our practis'd Age can calmely take Those sorrows, which like Feavers, vex the young. 63 When you in Lov's fair Books (which Poets keep) Read what they hide, his Tragick History, You will rejoyce that half your time is sleep, And smile at Love when Nature bids you die. 64 Learn then that Love's diseases common are; Doe not in sickness known (though new to you) Whilst vital heat does last, of cure dispaire: Love's vital heat does last, whilst Love is true. 65 Thus spake the kinde and prudent Astragon: And much their kinde impatience he appeas'd, For of his griefs (which heavi'er then their own Were born by both) their dutious fears are eas'd. 66 She begs, that he would pardon her distress, Thought that even sin which did his sorrow move; And then with all her Mother's lowliness His pardon craves for asking leave to love. 67 The Duke who saw fair Truth so undisguis'd, And love in all, but love so unconcern'd, Pitty'd the studious world, and all despis'd, Who did not here unlearn, what they had learn'd. 68 I am reform'd (said he) not that before I wanted love, or that my love was ill; But I have learnt to perfect Nature more By giving innocence a little skill. 69 For 'tis some skill in innocence to bear With temper the distempers of our Stars; Not doubling griefs already come by fear Of more, for fears but hasten threatned Wars. 70 But we will bravely suffer to inure Our strength to weights against the new are laid; That when 'tis known how much we can endure, Our sufferings may make our Foes afraid, 71 This Comet Glory shines but in portent; Which from the Court does send her threatning Beams; And looks as if it were by malice ment To hasten Oswald's Faction to extreams. 72 Since Hurgonil, who just fore-ran the Boy Could not instruct us, we as much may know Of the first light, as of these fires of joy; Which is, that both did out of darkness grow. 73 Yet this the King might hide in Kingly skill, Wisely to make his bounty more his own: Kings stoop for Councel, who impart their will; His Acts, like Heav'ns, make not their Causes known. 74 Yet with as plain a heart as Love untaught In Birtha wears, I here to Birtha make A vow, that Rhodalind I never sought, Nor now would with her love her greatnesse take. 75 Loves bonds are for her greatness made too straight; And me Ambition's pleasures cannot please; Even Priests who on the higher Altar wait; Think a continu'd rev'rence losse of ease. 76 Let us with secrecy our love protect; Hiding such precious wealth from publick view; The proffer'd glory I will first suspect As false, and shun it when I finde it true. 77 They now retire because they Goltho saw, Who hither came to watch with Ulfinore If much the Duke's woo'd Mistris did him awe; Since love woo'd him, and in the shape of Pow'r. 78 But when he mark'd that he did from them move With sodain shyness, he suppos'd it shame Of being seen in chase of Birtha's love; As if above it grown since Orgo came. 79 Goltho by nature was of Musick made, Cheerful as Victors warm in their success; He seem'd like Birds created to be glad, And nought but love could make him taste distress. 80 Hope, which our cautious Age scarce entertains, Or as a Flatt'rer gives her cold respect, He runs to meet, invites her, and complains Of one hours absence as a years neglect. 81 Hope, the world's welcom, and his standing Guest, Fed by the Rich, but Feasted by the Poor; Hope, that did come in triumph to his Breast, He thus presents in boast to Ulfinore. 82 Well may I (Friend) auspicious Love odore, Seeing my mighty Rivals takes no pride To be with Birtha seen; and he before (Thou knowst) injoyn'd that I his love should hide. 83 Nor do I break his trust when 'tis reveal'd To thee, since we are now so much the same, That when from thee, it is from me conceal'd, For we admit no diff'rence but in name. 84 But be it still from ev'ry other Ear Preserv'd, and strictly by our mutual vow: His Laws are still to my obedience dear, Who was my Gen'ral, though my Rival now. 85 And well thou knowst how much mine Eies did melt, When our great Leader they did first perceive Love's Captive led; whose sorrows then I felt, Though now for greater of mine own I grieve. 86 Nor do I now by love in duty err; For if I get what he would fain possesse, Then he a Monarch is, and I preferr Him, who undoes the World in being lesse. 87 When Heav'n (which hath preferr'd me to thy Brest Where Friendship is inthron'd,) shall make it known That I am worth thy love, which is exprest By making Heav'nly Birtha all mine own. 88 Then at this quiet Eden thou wilt call, And stay a while, to mark if Love's prais'd Plant Have after Spring a ripeness, and a Fall, Or never of the first abundance want. 89 And I shall tell thee then if Poets are In using Beauty's Pencil false, or blinde; For they have Birtha drawn but sweet and faire; Stiles of her Face, the Curtain of her Minde! 90 And thou at parting shalt her Picture weare, For Nature's honor, not to shew my pride; Try if her like the teeming World does beare, Then bring that Copy hither for thy Bride. 91 And they shall love as quietly as we; Their Beauty's pow'r no civil War will raise; But flourish, and like neighb'ring Flowres agree; Unless they kindly quarrel in our praise. 92 Then we for change will leave such luscious peace; In Camps their Favors shall our Helms adorn; For we can no way else our joys increase, But by beholding theirs at our return. 93 Thus cloth'd in Feathers, he on Steeples walks; Not guessing yet, that silent Ulfinore, Had study'd her of whom he loosly talks, And what he likes did solidly adore. 94 But Ulfinore with cold discretion aw'd His passion, and did grave with Love become; Though Youthfully he sent his Eies abroad, Yet kept with Manly care, his Tongue at home. 95 These Rival's hopes, he did with patience hear; His count'nance not uneasy seem'd, nor strange; Yet meant his cares should more like Love appear, If in the Duke Ambition bred a change. 96 But as the Duke shun'd them for secrecy, So now they from approaching Orgo move, Made by Discretion (Love's strict Tutor) shy, Which is to Lovers painful as their Love. 97 But Orgo they did ill suspect, whose Youth And nature yielded Lovers no offence; Us'd by his Lord for kindness and for truth; Both native in him as his innocence: 98 And here pass'd by in haste, to Court imploy'd, That Birtha may no more have cause to mourn: Full was his little Breast! and overjoy'd That much depended on his quick return! 99 Many like Orgo in their Manhoods Morn, As Pages did the noble Duke attend; The Sons of Chiefs, whom beauty did adorn, And fairer Vertue did that beauty mend. 100 These in his Heroe's Schools he bred (which were In Peace his Palace, and in War his Tent) As if Time's self had read sage Lectures there How he would have his howres (life's Treasure) spent 101 No action, though to shorten dreaded warre, Nor needful Counsels, though to lengthen Peace, Nor Love, of which wise Nature takes such care, Could from this useful work his cares release. 102 But with the early Sun he rose, and taught These Youths, by growing vertue to grow great; Shew'd greatness is without it blindly sought, A desp'rate charge which ends in base retreat. 103 He taught them shame, the sodain sence of ill; Shame, Nature's hasty Conscience, which forbids Weak inclination ere it grows to will, Or stays rash will, before it grows to deeds. 104 He taught them Honor, Vertue's bashfulness; A Fort so yeildless, that it fears to treat; Like Pow'r, it grows to nothing, growing less; Honor, the moral Conscience of the Great! 105 He taught them kindness; Soul's civilitie, In which, nor Courts, nor Citys have a part; For theirs is fashion, this from falshood free; Where Love, and pleasure, know no Lust nor Art. 106 And Love he taught; the Soul's stolne Visit made Though froward Age watch hard; and Law forbid; Her walks no Spie has trac'd, nor Mountain staide; Her friendship's cause, is as the Loadstone's hid. 107 He taught them love of Toyle; Toyle which does keep Obstructions from the Minde, and quench the blood; Ease but belongs to us like sleep, and sleep Like Opium, is our Med'cine, not our Food. 108 To Dangers us'd them; which Death's Visards are, More uggly then himself, and often chace From Batail Coward-life; but when we dare His Visard see, we never fear his Face. Canto the Third. The ARGUMENT. The Poet takes the Wise aside, to prove Even them concern'd in all he writes of Love. The dutious Orgo from the Court returns With joys, at which again fair Birtha mourns. The Duke with open Armes does entertain Those Guests whom he receives with secret pain. 1 Thou, who some Ages hence these Roles dost read (Kept as Records by Lovers of Love's pow'r) Thou who dost live, when I have long been dead, And feed'st from Earth, when Earth does me devowr: 2 Who liv'st, perhaps, amidst some Cities joys, Where they would fall asleep with Lazy peace, But that their triumphs make so great a noise, And their loud Bells cannot for nuptials cease: 3 Thou, who perhaps, proudly thy bloomy Bride Lead'st to some Temple, where I wither'd lie; Proudly, as if she Age's Frosts defy'd; And that thy springing self could never die: 4 Thou, to whom then the cheerful Quire will sing, Whilst hallow'd Lamps, and Tapers brave the Sun As a Lay-Light; and Bells in triumph ring, As when from sallies the Besiegers run. 5 That when the Priest has ended, if thine Eies Can but a little space her Eies forbear, To shew her where my Marble Coffin lies; Her Virgin Garlands she will offer there: 6 Confess, that reading me she learnt to love; That all the good behaviour of her heart, Even tow'rds thy self, my doctrine did improve; Where Love by Nature is forwarn'd of Art, 7 She will confess, that to her Maiden state This Story shew'd such Patterns of great Life, As though she then could those but imitate, They an Example make her now a Wife. 8 And thy life's fire could she awhile outlive (Which were, though lawful, neither kinde nor good) Then, even her sorrows would examples give; And shine to others through dark widowhood. 9 And she will boast, how spite of Cynick Age, Of bus'ness, which does Pow'r uncivil make, Of ruder Cells, where they Love's Fire asswage By study'ng Death, and fear for Vertue take: 10 And spite of Courts (where loving now is made An Art, as dying is in Cells) my Laws Did teach her how by Nature to perswade, And hold by vertue whom her beauty draws. 11 Thus when by knowing me, thou know'st to whom Love owes his Eies, who has too long been blinde; Then in the Temple leave my Bodies Tomb, To seek this Book, the Mon'ment of my Minde. 12 Where thou mai'st read; who with impatient Eies For Orgo on the guilded Tarras stay; Which high, and golden shews, and open lies, As the Morne's Window when she lets out Day. 13 Whose height Two rising Forrests over-looks; And on Pine-tops the Eiesight downward casts; Where distant Rivers seem bestrided Brooks, Churches but Anchor'd Ships, their Steeples, Masts. 14 Hence, by his little Regian Courser brought, Orgo they spie, with diligence indu'd, As if he would o'ertake forerunning Thought; And he by many swiftly seem'd pursu'd. 15 But his light speed left those awhile behinde; Whilst with rais'd Dust, their swiftness hid theway Yet Birtha will, too soon, by Orgo finde What she by distance lost in this survay. 16 Orgo a precious Casket did present To his dear Lord, of Podian Saphyr wrought; For which, unknown to Birtha, he was sent; And a more precious Pledg was in it brought. 17 Then thus proclaim'd his joy! Long may I live! Sent still with blessings from the Hea'nly Powers; And may their bountys shew what they can give; And full as fast as long expected Showres! 18 Behold the King, with such a shining Traine As dazles sight, yet can inform the Blind; But there the Rich, and Beautious shine in vaine, Unless they distance keep from Rhodalind. 19 Methinks, they through the Middle Region come; Their Chariots hid in Clouds of Dust below, And o're their Heads, their Coursers scatter'd Fome Does seem to cover them like falling Snow. 20 This Birtha heard, and she on Orgo cast A piteous look (for she no anger knew) But griev'd he knows not, that he brings too fast Such joys, as fain she faster would eschew. 21 So Gondibert this Gust of glory took As Men whose Sayls are full, more weather take; And she so gaz'd on him, as Sea-men look On long sought shore, when Tempests drive them back. 22 But now these Glorys more apparent be; And justly all their observation claim'd; Great, as in greatest Courts less Princes see, When entertain'd to be eclips'd, and sham'd. 23 West from Verona's Road, through pleasant Meads Their Chariots cross; and to the Palace steer; And Aribert this winged triumph leads; Which like the Planets Progress did appear. 24 So shin'd they, and so noisless seem'd their speed; Like Spartans, touching but the silken Reynes, Was all the conduct which their Coursers need; And proudly to sit still, was all their pains. 25 With Aribert sat royal Rhodalind; Calm Orna by the Count; by Hermegild (Silver'd with time) the Golden Gartha shin'd; And Tybalt's Eies were full by Laura fill'd. 26 The lesser Beauties, numberless as Stars, Shew'd sickly and far off, to this Noon-day; And lagg'd like Baggage Treasure in the Wars; Or only seem'd, another milkie way. 27 The Duke perceiv'd, the King design'd to make This visit more familiar by surprise; And with Court art, he would no notice take Of that, which Kings are willing to disguise. 28 But as in heedless sleep, the House shall seem New wak'd with this Alarm; and Ulfin strait (Whose fame was precious in the Courts esteem) Must, as with casual sight, their entrance wait. 29 To Astragon he doubles all his Vows; To Birtha, through his Eies, his Heart reveal'd; And by some civil jealousies he shows Her beauty from the Court must be conceal'd. 30 Prays her, from Envy's danger to retire; The Palace war; which there can never cease Till Beauty's force in age or death expire: A War disguis'd in civil shapes of Peace, 31 Still he the precious Pledg kept from her view; Who guess'd not by the Casket his intent; And was so willing not to fear him true, That she did fear to question what it ment. 32 Now hasts she to be hid; and being gon, Her Lover thinks the Planet of the day So leaves the mourning World to give the Moon (Whose Train is mark'd but for their number) way. 33 And entring in her Closet (which took light Full in the Palace Front) she findes her Maids Gather'd to see this gay unusual sight; Which Commet-like, their wondring Eies invades. 34 Where Thula would by climbing highest be, Though ancient grown, and was in stature short; Yet did protest, she came not there to see, But to be hid from dangers of the Court. 35 Their curious longing Birtha durst not blame (Boldness, which but to seeing did aspire) Since she her self, provok'd with Courts great Fame, Would fain a little see what all admire. 36 Then through the Casement ventur'd so much Face As Kings depos'd, shew when through grates they peep, To see Deposers to their Crowning passe; But strait shrink back, and at the triumph weep. 37 Soon so her Eies did too much glory finde; For ev'n the first she saw was all; for she No more would view since that was Rhodalind; And so much beauty could none others be. 38 Which with her Vertue weigh'd (no less renown'd) Afflicts her that such worth must fatal prove; And be in tears of the Possessor drown'd, Or she depose her Lover by her Love. 39 But Thula (wildly earnest in the view Of such gay sights as she did ne'r behold) Mark'd not when Birtha her sad Eies withdrew; But dreamt the World was turn'd again to Gold. 40 Each Lady most, till more appear'd, ador'd; Then with rude liking prais'd them all alowd; Yet thought them foul and course to ev'ry Lord; And civilly to ev'ry Page she bow'd 41 The objects past, out-sigh'd even those that woo; And strait her Mistris at the Window mist; Then finding her in grief, out-sigh'd her too; And her fair Hands with parting passion kist: 42 Did with a Servants usual art profess That all she saw, was to her beauty black; Confess'd their Maids well bred, and knew to dress, But said those Courts are poor which painting lack. 43 Thy praise (said Birtha) poyson'd is with spite; May blisters cease on thy uncivil Tongue, Which strives so wickedly to do me right, By doing Rhodalind and Orna wrong. 44 False Fame, thy Mistris, tutor'd thee amiss; Who teaches School in streets, where Crowds resort; Fame, false, as that their beauty painted is; The common Country slander on the Court. 45 With this rebuke, Thula takes gravely leave; Pretends she'll better judge ere they be gon; At least see more, though they her sight deceive; Whilst Birtha findes, wilde Fear feeds best alone. 46 Ulfin receives, and through Art's Palace guides The King; who owns him with familiar grace; Though Twice seven Years from first observance hides Those Marks of valor which adorn'd his Face. 47 Then Astragon with hasty homage bows: And says, when thus his beams he does dispence In lowly visits, like the Sun he shows Kings made for universal influence. 48 Him with renown the King for Science pays, And Vertue; which Gods likest Pictures bee; Drawn by the Soul, whose onely hire is praise; And from such Salary not Heav'n is free. 49 Then kindly he inquires for Gondibert; When, and how far his wounds in danger were? And does the cautious progress of his Art Alike with wonder and with pleasure heare. 50 Now Gondibert advanc'd, but with delay; As fetter'd by his love for he would fain Dissembled weakness might procure his stay, Here where his Soul does as in Heav'n remain. 51 Him, Creature like, the King did boldly use With publick love; to have it understood That Kings, like God, may chuse whom they will chuse; And what they make, judge with their own Eies good. 52 This grace the Duke at bashful distance takes; And Rhodalind so much concern'd is grown, That his surprisal she her troubles makes; Blushing, as if his blushes were her own. 53 Now the bright Train with Astragon ascend; Whilst Hermegild, with Gartha moves behinde; Whom much this gracious visit did offend; But thus he practis'd to appease her minde. 54 Judge not you strangely in this visit showe; As well in Courts think wise disembling new; Nor think the kindness strange, though to your Foe, Till all in Courts where they are kinde are true. 55 Why should your closer mourning more be worn? Poor Priests invented Blacks for lesser cost; Kings for their Syres in Regal Purple mourn; Which shews what they have got, not what they lost. 56 Though rough the way to Empire be, and steep, You look that I should level it so plain, As Babes might walk it barefoot in their sleep; But Pow'r is the reward of patient pain! 57 This high Hill Pow'r, whose Bowels are of Gold, Shews neer to greedy and unpractis'd sight; But many grow in travail to it old, And have mistook the distance by the height. 58 If those old Travailers may thither be Your trusted Guides, they will your haste reform; And give you fears of Voyages by Sea; Which are not often made without a storm. 59 Yet short our Course shall prove, our passage faire, If in the Steerage you will quiet stand, And not make storms of ev'ry breath of Aire; But think the Helm, safe in the Pilots hand. 60 You like some fatal King (who all Men hears Yet trusts intirely none) your trust mistake, As too much weight for one: One Pillar bears Weight that would make a Thousand Shoulders ake. 61 Your Brothers storm I to a calm have turn'd; Who lets this guilded sacrifice proceed To Hymen's Altar, by the King adorn'd, As Priests give Victims Gerlonds ere they bleed. 62 Hubert to triumph would not move so faste; Yet you (though but a kinde Spectator) mean To give his triumph Laws, and make more haste To see it pass, then he does to be seen. 63 With patience lay this Tempest of your heart! For you, ere long, this Angels form shall turn To fatal Man's; and for that shape of Art, Some may, as I for yours of Nature, mourn. 64 Thus by her Love-sick Statesman she was taught; And smil'd, with joy of wearing Manly shape; Then smil'd, that such a smile his Heart had caught; Whose Nets Camps break not through, nor Senates scape. Canto the Fourth. The ARGUMENT. The King to Gondibert is grown so kinde, That he prevents the bounteous Rhodalind In giving of her love; and Gondibert Laments his Breast holds but a single heart; Which Birtha grieves her beauty did subdue, Since he undoes the world in being true. 1 Full grows the Presence now, as when all know Some stranger Prince must be receiv'd with state; When Courts shew those, who come to see the Show; And all gay Subjects like Domesticks waite. 2 Nor Ulfinore nor Goltho absent were; Whose hopes expect what list'ning Birtha (hid In the adjoyning Closet) fears to heare, And beggs kinde Heav'n in pitty would forbid. 3 The King (who never time nor Pow'r mis-spent In Subjects bashfulness, whiling great deeds Like Coward Councels, who too late consent) Thus to his secret will aloud proceeds. 4 If to thy Fame (brave Youth) I could add wings, Or make her Trumpet louder by my voice, I would (as an example drawn for Kings) Proclaim the cause, why thou art now my choice. 5 But this were to supect the world asleep, Or all our Lombards with their envy blinde, Or that the Hunns somuch for bondage weep, As their drown'd Eies cannot thy Trophies finde. 6 When this is heard, none dare of what I give Presume their equal merit might have shar'd; And to say more, might make thy Foes believe, Thy dang'rous worth is grown above reward. 7 Reward even of a Crown, and such a Crown, As by Heav'n's Model ancient Victors wore; When they, as by their Coyn, by Laws were known; For Laws but made more currant Victors pow'r. 8 A Crown soon taught, by whom Pow'r first was given; When Victors (of Dominion cautious made By hearing of that old revolt in Heav'n) Kept Pow'r too high for Subjects to invade. 9 A Crown, which ends by Armies their debate, Who question height of Pow'r; who by the Law (Till plain obedience they make intricate) Would not the People, but their Rulers aw. 10 To Pow'r adoption makes thy Title good; Preferring worth, as birth give Princes place; And Vertue's claim exceeds the right of Blood, As Souls extraction does the Bodies Race. 11 Yet for thy Bloods long walk through Princes veins, Thou maist with any Lombard measure time; Though he his hidden house in Illium feigns; And not step short, when Hubert's self would climbe. 12 And Hubert is of highest Victors breed; Whose worth I shall for distant Empire chuse; If he will learn, that you by Fate precede, And what he never had, he cannot lose. 13 His valor shall the Gothick conquest keep; And would to Heav'n that all your mighty mindes As soon were pleas'd, as Infants are with sleep, And you had Musick common as the windes. 14 That all the Year your Seasons were like Spring; All joy'd as Birds, and all as Lovers kinde; That ev'ry famous Fighter were a King, And each like you could have a Rhodalind. 15 For she is yours, as your adoption free; And in that gift my remnant Life I give; But 'tis to you, brave Youth! Who now are she; And she that Heav'n where secondly I live. 16 And richer then that Crown (which shall be thine, When Life's long Progress I am gone with Fame) Take all her love; which scarce forbears to shine And own thee, through her Virgin-Curtain, shame. 17 Thus spake the King; and Rhodalind rppear'd Through publish'd Love, with so much bashfulness, As young Kings shew, when by surprise o're-heard Moaning to Fav'rite Eares a deep distress. 18 For Love is a distress, and would be hid Like Monarchs griefs, by which they bashful grow; And in that shame beholders they forbid; Since those blush most, who must their blushes show. 19 And Gondibert with dying Eies did grieve At her vail'd love (a wound he cannot heal) As great Mindes mourn, who cannot then relieve The vertuous, when through shame they want conceal. 20 And now cold Birtha's rosy looks decay; Who in fear's Frost had like her beauty dy'd, But that Attendant Hope perswades her stay A while, to hear her Duke; who thus reply'd. 21 Victorious King! Abroad your Subjects are Like Legats safe; at home like Altars free! Even by your fame they conquer as by warre; And by your Laws safe from each other be. 22 A King you are o're Subjects, so as wise And noble Husbands seem o're Loyal Wives; Who claim not, yet confess their liberties, And brag to strangers of their happy lives. 23 To Foes a winter storm; whilst your Friends bow Like Summer Trees, beneath your bountys load; To me (next-him whom your great self, with low And cheerful duty serves) a giving God. 24 Since this is you, and Rhodalind (the Light By which her Sex fled Vertue finde) is yours; Your Diamond, which tests of jealous sight, The stroke, and fire, and Oisel's juice endures; 25 Since she so precious is, I shall appear All counterfeit, of Art's disguises made; And never dare approach her Lustre neer; Who scarce can hold my vallew in the shade. 26 Forgive me that I am not what I seem; But falsly have dissembled an excess Of all such vertues as you most esteem; But now grow good but as I ils confess. 27 Far in Ambition's Feaver am I gone! Like raging Flame aspiring is my Love; Like Flame destructive too, and like the Sun Does round the world tow'rds change of Objects move. 28 Nor is this now through vertuous shame confess'd; But Rhodalind does force my conjur'd feare, As Men whom evil spirits have possess'd, Tell all when saintly Votaries appeare, 29 When she will grace the Bridal Dignitie, It will be soon to all young Monarchs known; Who then by posting through the World will trie Who first can at her Feet present his Crown. 30 Then will Verona seem the Inn of Kings; And Rhodalind shall at her Palace Gate Smile, when great Love these Royal Sutors brings; Who for that smile would as for Empire waite. 31 Amongst this ruling Race she choyce may take For warmth of Valor, coolness of the minde, Eies that in Empire's drowsie Calms can wake, In storms look out, in darkness dangers find. 32 A Prince who more inlarges pow'r then lands; Whose greatness is not what his Map contains; But thinks that his, where he at full commands; Not where his Coyn does pass, but pow'r remains. 33 Who knows that Pow'r can never be too high When by the Good possest; for 'tis in them The swelling Nyle; from which though People fly, They prosper most by rising of the stream. 34 Thus (Princess) you should chuse; and you will finde; Even he, since Men are Wolves must civilize (As light does tame some Beasts of savage kinde) Himself yet more, by dwelling in your Eies. 35 Such was the Duke's reply; whih did produce Thoughts of a diverse shape through sev'ral Eares: His jealous Rivals mourn at his excuse; But Astragon it cures of all his feares: 36 Birtha his praise of Rhodalind bewayles; And now her hope a weak Physitian seems, For Hope, the common Comforter, prevailes Like common Med'cines, slowly in extreams. 37 The King (secure in offer'd Empire) takes This forc'd excuse, as troubled bashfulness, And a disguise which sodain passion makes, To hide more joy then prudence should express. 38 And Rhodalind (who never lov'd before, Nor could suspect his love was giv'n away) Thought not the treasure of his Breast so poore, But that it might his debts of honor pay. 39 To hasten the rewards of his desert, The King does to Verona him command; And kindness so impos'd, not all his Art Can now instruct his duty to withstand. 40 Yet whilst the King does now his time dispose In seeing wonders, in this Palace shown, He would a parting kindness pay to those Who of their wounds are yet not perfect grown. 41 And by this fair pretence, whilst on the King Lord Astragon through all the House attends, Young Orgo does the Duke to Birtha bring; Who thus her sorrows to his bosome sends. 42 Why should my Storm your Life's calm voyage vex? Destroying wholly vertue's Race in one; So by the first of my unlucky Sex, All in a single ruine were undone. 43 Make Heav'nly Rhodalind your Bride! Whilst I Your once lov'd Maid, excuse you, since I know That vertuous Men forsake so willingly Long cherish'd life, because to Heav'n they go. 44 Let me her servant be! A Dignity, Which if your pity in my fall procures; I still shall vallew the advancement high, Not as the Crown is hers, but she is yours. 45 E're this high sorrow up to dying grew, The Duke the Casket op'ned, and from thence (Form'd like a Heart) a cheerful Emrauld drew; Cheerful, as if the lively stone had sence. 46 The Thirti'th Carract it had doubled Twice; Not tak'n from the Attick Silver Mine, Nor from the Brass, though such (of nobler price) Did on the Necks of Parthian Ladies shine: 47 Nor yet of those which make the Ethiop proud; Nor taken from those Rocks where Bactrians climbe; But from the Scythian, and without a Cloud; Not sick at fire, nor languishing with time. 48 Then thus he spake! This (Birtha) from my Male Progenitors, was to the loyal she On whose kinde Heart they did in love prevail, The Nuptial Pledge, and this I give to thee! 49 Seven Centuries have pass'd, since it from Bride To Bride did first succeed; and though tis known From ancient lore, that Gemms much vertue hide, And that the Emrauld is the Bridal Stone. 50 Though much renown'd because it chastness loves, And will when worn by the neglected wife, Shew when her absent Lord disloyal proves, By faintness, and a pale decay of life; 51 Though Emraulds serve as Spies to jealous Brides, Yet each compar'd to this does councel keep; Like a false Stone, the Husbands falsh-hood hides, Or seems born blinde, or feigns a dying sleep, 52 With this take Orgo, as a better Spy; Who may in all your kinder feares be sent To watch at Court, if I deserve to die By making this to fade, and you lament. 53 Had now an artfull Pencil Birtha drawn (With grief all dark, then strait with joy all light) He must have fancy'd first, in early dawn, A sudden break of beauty out of Night. 54 Or first he must have mark'd what paleness, Fear, Like nipping Frost, did to her visage bring; Then think he sees, in a cold backward year, A Rosy Morn begin a sudden Spring. 55 Her joys (too vaste to be contain'd in speech) Thus she a little spake! Why stoop you down, My plighted Lord, to lowly Birtha's reach, Since Rhodalind would lift you to a Crown? 56 Or why do I, when I this plight imbrace, Boldly aspire to take what you have given? But that your vertue has with Angels place, And 'tis a vertue to aspire to Heav'n. 57 And as tow'rds Heav'n all travail on their Knees; So I tow'rds you, though Love aspire, will move: And were you crown'd, what could you better please Then aw'd obedience led by bolder Love? 58 If I forget the depth from whence I rise, Far from your bosome banish'd be my heart; Or claim a right by beauty to your Eyes; Or proudly think, my chastity desert. 59 But thus ascending from your humble Maid To be your plighted Bride, and then your Wife, Will be a debt that shall be hourly paid, Till Time my duty cancel with my life. 60 And fruitfully if Heav'n ere make me bring Your Image to the World, you then my pride No more shall blame, then you can tax the Spring For boasting of those Flowres she cannot hide. 61 Orgo, I so receive as I am taught By duty to esteem what ere you love; And hope the joy he in this Jewel brought, Will luckyer then his former triumphs prove. 62 For though but Twice he has approach'd my sight, He Twice made haste to drown me in my Tears: But now I am above his Planets spite, And as for sin beg pardon for my fears. 63 Thus spake she; and with fix'd continu'd sight, The Duke did all her bashful beauties view; Then they with kisses seal'd their sacred plight; Like Flowres still sweeter as they thicker grew. 64 Yet must these pleasures feel, though innocent, The sickness of extremes, and cannot last; For Pow'r (Love's shun'd Impediment) has sent To tell the Duke, his Monarch is in hast: 65 And calls him to that triumph which he fears So as a Saint forgiven (whose Breast does all Heav'n's joys contain) wisely lov'd Pomp forbears; Lest tempted Nature should from blessings fall. 66 He often takes his leave, with Love's delay; And bids her hope, he with the King shall finde, By now appearing forward to obay, A meanes to serve him less in Rhodalind. 67 She weeping to her Closet-window hies; Where she with teares does Rhodalind survey; As dying Men, who grieve that they have Eyes, When they through Curtains spy the rising day. 68 The King has now his curious sight suffis'd With all lost Arts, in their revival view'd; Which when restor'd, our pride thinks new devis'd: Fashions of Mindes, call'd new when but renew'd! 69 The busie Court prepares to move, on whom Their sad offended Eyes the Country caste; Who never see enough where Monarchs come; And nothing so uncivil seems as haste. 70 As Men move slow, who know they lose their way, Even so the Duke tow'rds Rhodalind does move; Yet he does dutious fears, and wonder pay, Which are the first, and dangerous signes of Love. 71 All his addresses much by Goltho were And Ulfinore observ'd; who distant stand; Not daring to approach his presence neer; But shun his Eyes to scape from his command: 72 Least to Verona he should both require; For by remaining here, both hope to light Their Hymen's Torches at his parting fire; And not dispaire to kindle them to night. 73 The King his Golden Chariot now ascends; Which neer fair Rhodalind the Duke containes; Though to excuse that grace he lowly bends; But honor so refus'd, more honor gaines. 74 And now their Chariots (ready to take wing) Are even by weakest breath, a whisper stay'd; And but such whisper as a Page does bring To Laura's Woman from a Houshold Maid. 75 But this low voice did raise in Laura's Eare An Eccho, which from all redoubled soon; Proclaiming such a Country beauty here, As makes them look, like Ev'ning to her Noon. 76 And Laura (of her own high beauty proud, Yet not to others cruel) softly prays, She may appear! but Gartha, bold, and loud, With Eyes impatient as for conquest, stays. 77 Though Astragon now owns her, and excus'd Her presence as a Maid but rudely taught, Infirm in health, and not to greatness us'd; Yet Gartha still calls out, to have her brought! 78 But Rhodalind (in whose relenting Breast Compassion's self might fit at School, and learn) Knew bashful Maids with publick view distrest; And in their Glass, themselves with fear discern; 79 She stopt this Challenge which Court-Beauty made To Country shape; not knowing Nature's hand Had Birtha dress'd, nor that her self obay'd In vain, whom conqu'ring Birtha did command. 80 The Duke (whom vertuous kindness soon subdues) Though him his Bonds from Birtha highly please, Yet seems to think, that lucky he, who sues To wear this royal Mayd's, will walk at ease. 81 Of these a brief survey sad Birtha takes; And Orgo's help directs her Eye to all; Shews her for whom grave Tybalt nightly wakes; Then at whose feet wise Hermegild does fall. 82 And when calm Orna with the Count she saw, Hope (who though weak, a willing Painter is, And busily does ev'ry Pattern draw) By that example could not work amiss. 83 For soon she shap'd her Lord and her so kinde, So all of love; till Fancy wrought no more When she perceiv'd him sit with Rhodalind; But froward-Painter-like the Copy tore. 84 And now they move; and she thus robb'd, believes (Since with such haste they bear her wealth avvay) That they at best, are but judicious Thieves, And knovv the noble vallue of their Prey. 85 And then she thus complain'd! Why royal Maid! Injurious Greatness! Did you hither come Where Pow'r's strong Nets of Wyre were never laid? But childish Love took Cradle as at home. 86 Where can we safe our harmless blessings keep, Since glorious Courts our solitude invade? Bells which ring out, when th'unconcern'd would sleep; False lights to scare poor Birds in Country shade! 87 Or if our joys their own discov'ry make, Envy (whose Tongue first kills whom she devours) Calls it our Pride; Envy, The poys'nous snake, Whose breath blasts Maids, as innocent as Flowres! 88 Forgive me beautious Greatness, if I grow Distemper'd with my fears, and rudely long To be secure; or praise your beauty so As to believe, that it may do me wrong! 89 And you my plighted Lord, forgive me too, If since your worth and my defects I find, I fear what you in justice ought to do; And praise your judgment when I doubt you kind. 90 Now sudden fear o'er all her beauty wrought The pale appearance of a killing Frost; And careful Orgo, when she started, thought She had her Pledg, the precious Emrauld, lost. 91 But that kinde Heart, as constant as her own, She did not miss; 'twas from a sudden sence, Least in her Lover's heart some change was grown, And it grew pale with that intelligence. 92 Soon from her bosome she this Emrauld took: If now (said she) my Lord my Heart deceaves, This Stone will by dead paleness make me look Pale as the Snowy skin of Lilly Leaves. 93 But such a cheerful green the Gemm did fling Where she oppos'd the Rayes, as if she had Been dy'de in the complexion of the Spring, Or were by Nimphs of Brittain Valleys clad. 94 Soon she vvith earnest passion kist the Stone; Which ne'r till then had suffer'd an Eclipse; But then the Rayes retir'd, as if it shone In vain, so neer the Rubies of her Lips. 95 Yet thence remov'd, vvith publick glory shines! She Orgo blest, vvho had this Relique brought; And kept it like those Reliques lock'd in shrines, By vvhich the latest Miracles vvere vvrought. 96 For soon respect was up to rev'rence grown; Which fear to Superstition would sublime, But that her Father took Fear's Ladder down; Lose steps, by which distress to Heav'n would climbe. 97 He knew, when Fear shapes Heav'nly Pow'r so just, And terrible (parts of that shape drawn true) It vailes Heav'n's beauty, Love; which when we trust, Our courage honors him to whom we sue! Canto the Fifth. The ARGUMENT. The deep Designes of Birtha in distress; Her Emrauld's vertue shews her Love's success, Wise Astragon with reason cures despair; And the Afflicted chides for partial Pray'r. With grief the secret Rivals take their leave; And but dark hope for hidden love receive. 1 To shew the Morn her passage to the East, Now Birtha's dawn, the Lover's Day, appears! So soon Love beats Revellies in her Breast; And like the Dewy Morn she rose in tears: 2 So much she did her jealous dreams dislike. Her Maids strait kindle by her light their Eyes; Which when to hers compar'd, Poets would strike Such sparks to light their Lamps, ere Day does rise. 3 But O vain Jealousie! Why dost thou haste To find those evils which too soon are brought? Love's frantick Valor! which so rashly faste Seeks dangers, as if none would come unsought. 4 As often fairests Morns soon cover'd be, So she with dark'ning thoughts is clouded now; Looks so, as weaker Eyes small objects see, Or studious Statesmen who contract the Brovv. 5 Or like some thinking Sybill that vvould finde The sence of mystick vvords by Angels given! And this fair Politick bred in her minde (Restless as Seas) a deep designe on Heav'n. 6 To Pray'rs plain Temple she does hast unseen; Which though not grac'd with curious cost for shovv, Was nicely kept; and now must be as clean As Tears make those who thence forgiven goe. 7 For her own Hands (by which best Painters drew The Hands of Innocence) will make it shine; Pennance which newly from her terrors grew; And was (alass!) part of her deep designe. 8 And when this holy huswifry was past, Her vows she sends to Heav'n, which thither fly Intire; not broken by unthinking hast; Like Sinners Sparks that in ascending dy. 9 Thence she departs; but at this Temple Gate A needy Crowd (call'd by her Summons there) With such assurance for her bounty waite, As if ne'r failing Heav'n their Debtor were. 10 To these she store of Antick Treasure gave (For she no Money knew) Medals of Gold, Which curious Gathe'rers did in travail save, And at high worth were to her Mother sold. 11 Figures of fighting Chiefs, born to o'rcome Those who without their leave would all destroy; Chiefs, who had brought renown to Athens, Rome, To Carthage, Tyre, and to lamented Troy. 12 Such was her wealth, her Mothers Legacy; And well she knew it was of special price; But she has begg'd what Heav'n must not deny; So would not make a common Sacrifice. 13 To the black Temple she her Sorrow bears; Where she outbeg'd the tardy begging Thief; Made weeping Magdaline but poor in Tears, Yet Silent as their Pictures was her Grief. 14 Her purpos'd penance she did here fulfil; Those Pictures dress'd, and the spent Lamp reliev'd With fragrant Oyles, dropp'd from her Silver Still; And now for those that there sat mourning, griev'd. 15 Those Penitents, who knew her innocence, Wonder what Parents sin she did bemoan; And venture (though they goe unpardon'd thence) More sighs for her redress then for her own. 16 Now jealousie no more benights her face, Her courage beautious grows, and grief decayes; And with such joy as shipwrack'd Men imbrace The Shore, she hastens to the House of Praise. 17 And there the Gemm she from her bosome took, (With which till now she trembled to advise) So far from pale, that Gondibert would look Pale if he saw, how it out-shin'd her Eyes. 18 These Rayes she to a Miracle prefers; And lustre that such beauty so defies, Had Poets seen (Love's partial Jewellers, Who count nought precious but their Mistress Eyes) 19 They would with grief a miracle confess! She enters strait to pay her gratitude; And could not think her beauty in distress, Whilst to her Love, her Lord is still subdu'd. 20 The Altar she with Imagry array'd; Where Needles boldly, as a Pencil wrought, The story of that humble Syrian Maid, Who Pitchers bore, yet Kings to Juda brought. 21 And there she of that precious Linnen spreads, Which in the consecrated Month is spun By Lombard Brides; for whom in empty Beds Their Bridegrooms sigh till the succeeding Moon. 22 'Tis in that Moon bleach'd by her fuller Light; And wash'd in Sudds of Amber, till it grow Clean as this Spredders Hands; and those were white As rising Lillies, or as falling Snow. 23 The voluntary Quire of Birds she feeds, Which oft had here the Virgin-Consort fill'd; She diets them with Aromatick seeds; And quench'd their Thirst with Rainbow-Dew distill'd. 24 Lord Astragon, whose tender care did waite Her progress, since her Morn so cloudy broke, Arrests her passage at this Temple Gate, And thus, he with a Father's license spoke. 25 Why art thou now, who hast so joyful liv'd E're love thou knew'st, become with Love so sad? If thou hast lost fair Vertue, then be griev'd; Else shew, thou know'st her worth by being glad. 26 Thy love's high soaring cannot be a crime; Nor can we if a Spinster loves a King, Say that her love ambitiously does climbe: Love seeks no honor, but does honor bring. 27 Mounts others value, and her own lets fall! Kings honor is but little, till made much By Subjects Tongues! Elixer-Love turns all To pow'rful Gold, where it does only touch. 28 Thou lov'st a Prince above thine own degree: Degree is Monarch's Art, Love, Nature's Law; In Love's free State all Pow'rs so Levell'd be, That there, affection governs more then aw. 29 But thou dost love where Rhodalind does love; And thence thy griefs of Jealousie begin; A cause which does thy sorrow vainly move; Since 'tis thy noble fate, and not thy Sin. 30 This Vain and voluntary Loade of grief (For fate sent Love, thy will does sorrow bear) Thou to the Temple carry'st for relief; And so to Heav'n art guided by thy fear. 31 Wilde Fear! Which has a Common-wealth devis'd In Heav'n's old Realm, and Saints in Senates fram'd; Such as by which, were Beasts well civiliz'd, They would suspect their Tamer Man, untam'd. 32 Wilde Fear! Which has the Indian worship made; Where each unletter'd Priest the Godhead draws In such a form, as makes himself afraid; Disguising Mercy's shape in Teeth and Claws. 33 This false Guide Fear, which does thy Reason sway, And turns thy valiant vertue to despair, Has brought thee here, to offer, and to pray; But Temples were not built for Cowards pray'r. 34 For when by Fear thy noble Reason's led (Reason, not Shape gives us so great degree Above our Subjects, Beasts) then Beasts may plead A right in Temples helps as well as we. 35 And here, with absent Reason thou dost weep To beg success in love; that Rhodalind May lose, what she as much does beg to keep; And may at least an equal audience find. 36 Mark Birtha, this unrighteous war of prayer! Like wrangling States, you ask a Monarchs aide When you are weak, that you may better dare Lay claim, to what your passion would invade. 37 Long has th' ambitious World rudely preferr'd Their quarrels, which they call their pray'rs, to Heav'n; And thought that Heav'n would like themselves have err'd. Depriving some, of what's to others given. 38 Thence Modern Faith becomes so weak and blinde, Thinks Heav'n in ruling other Worlds imploy'd, And is not mindful of our abject Kinde, Because all Sutes are not by all enjoy'd. 39 How firm was Faith, when humbly Sutes for need, Not choice were made? then (free from all despair As mod'rate Birds, who sing for daily Seed) Like Birds, our Songs of Praise included prayer. 40 Thy Hopes are by thy Rival's vertue aw'd; Thy Rival Rhodalind; whose Vertue shines On Hills, when brightest Planets are abroad; Thine privately, like Miners Lamps, in Mines. 41 The Court (where single Patterns are disgrac'd; Where glorious Vice, weak Eies admire; And Vertu's plainness is by Art out fac'd) She makes a Temple by her Vestal Fire. 42 Though there, Vice sweetly dress'd, does tempt like bliss Even Cautious Saints; and single Vertue seem Fantastick, where brave Vice in fashion is; Yet she has brought plain Vertue in esteem. 43 Yours is a vertue of inferior rate; Here in the dark a Pattern, where 'tis barr'd From all your Sex that should her imitate, And of that pomp which should her Foes reward. 44 Retyr'd, as weak Monasticks fly from care; Or devout Cowards steal to Forts, their Cells, From pleasures, which the worlds chief dangers are: Hers passes yours, as Valor fear excels. 45 This is your Rival in your sute to Heav'n: But Heav'n is partial if it give to you What to her bolder Vertue should be given; Since yours, pomps, Vertu's dangers, never knew: 46 Your sute would have your love with love repay'd; To which Arts conquests, when all science flowes, Compar'd, are Students dreams; and triumphs made By glorious Courts and Camps but painted showes. 47 Even Arts Dictators, who give Laws to Schools, Are but dead Heads; Statesmen, who Empire move, But prosp'rous Spys, and Victors, fighting Fools, When they their Trophies rank with those of Love. 48 And when against your fears I thus declame, (Yet make your danger more, whilst I decry Your worth to hers) then wisely fear I blame; For fears are hurtfull'st when attempts are high: 49 And you should think your noble dangers less, When most my praise does her renown prefer; For that takes off your hasty hope's excess; And when we little hope, we nothing fear. 50 Now you are taught your sickness, learn your cure; You shall to Court, and there serve Rhodalind; Trie if her vertue's force you can endure In the same Sphear, without eclipse of mind. 51 Your Lord may there your Souls compare; for we, Though Souls, like Stars make not their greatness known; May find which greater then the other be; The Stars are measur'd by Comparison! 52 Your plighted Lord shall you ere long preferr To neer attendance on this royal Maid; Quit then officious Fear! The Jealous fear They are not fearful, when to death afraid. 53 These words he clos'd with kindness, and retir'd; In which her quick-ey'd-Hope three blessings spy'd; With joy of being neer her Lord, inspir'd, With seeing Courts, and having Vertue try'd! 54 She now with jealous questions, utter'd faste, Fills Orgo's Ear, which there unmark'd are gone, As Throngs through guarded Gates, when all make haste, Not giving Warders time t' examine one. 55 She ask'd if Fame had render'd Rhodalind With favour, or in Truth's impartial shape? If Orna were to humble Vertue kinde, And beauty could from Gartha's envy scape? 56 If Laura (whose faire Eyes those but invites, Who to her wit ascribe the Victory) In conquest of a speechless Maid delights? And ere to this prompt Orgo could reply, 57 She ask'd, in what consist the Charms of Court? Whether those pleasures so resistless were As common Country Travailers report, And such as innocence had cause to feare? 58 What kinde of Angels shape young Fav'rites take? And being Angels, how they can be bad? Or why delight so cruelly to make Fair Country Maids, return from Court so sad? 59 More had she ask'd (for study warm'd her brow, With thinking how her love might prosp'rous be) But that young Ulfinore approach'd her now, And Goltho, warmer with designe then she. 60 Though Goltho's hope (in Indian Feathers clad) Was light, and gay, as if he meant to flie; Yet he no farther then his Rival had Advanc'd in promise, from her Tongue, or Eye. 61 When distant, talk'd, as if he plighted were; For hope in Love, like Cowards in the Warr, Talks bravely till the enterprise be neer; But then discretion dares not venture farr. 62 He never durst approach, her watchfull Eye With studious gazing, nor with sighs her Eare; But still seem'd frolick, like a Statesman's Spy; As if his thoughtful bus'ness were not there. 63 Still, Superstitious Lovers Beauty paint, (Thinking themselves but Devils) so divine, As if the thing belov'd, were all a Saint; And ev'ry place she enter'd, were a Shrine. 64 And though last Night were the auspitious time When they resolv'd to quit their bashful fears; Yet soon (as to the Sun when Eaglets climbe) They stoop'd, and quench'd their daring Eyes in tears. 65 And now (for Hope, that formal Centry, stands All Winds and Showrs, though where but vainly plac'd) They to Verona beg her dear commands; And look to be with parting kindness grac'd, 66 Both daily journies meant, 'twixt this and Court: For taking leave is twice Love's sweet Repast; In being sweet, and then in being short; Like Manna, ready still, but cannot last. 67 Her Favours not in lib'ral looks she gave, But in a kinde respectful lowliness, Them honor gives, yet did her honor save; Which gently thus, she did to both express. 68 High Heav'n that did direct your Eyes the way To chuse so well, when you your friendship made, Still keep you joyn'd, that daring Envy may Fear such united Vertue to invade! 69 In your safe Brests, the Noble Gondibert Does trust the secret Treasure of his love; And I (grown Conscious of my low desert) Would not, you should that wealth for me improve. 70 I am a Flow'r that merit not the Spring! And he (the World's warm Sun!) in passing by Should think, when such as I leave flourishing, His Beams to Cedars haste, which else would die. 71 This from his humble Maid you may declare To him, on whom the good of humane kinde Depends; and as his greatning is your care, So may your early love successes finde! 72 So may that beautious She, whom eithers Heart For vertue and delight of life shall chuse, Quit in your siege the long defence of Art, And Nature's freedom in a treaty lose. 73 This gave cold Ulfinore in Love's long Night Some hope of Day; as Sea-men that are run Far Northward finde long Winters to be light, And in the Cynosure, adore the Sun. 74 It shew'd to Goltho, not alone like Day, But like a wedding Noon; who now grows strong Enough to speak; but that her beauties stay His Eyes, whose wonder soon arrests his Tongue. 75 Yet something he at parting seem'd to say, In pretty Flow'rs of Love's wild Rhetorick; Which mov'd not her, though Orators thus sway Assemblies, which since wilde, wilde Musick like. Canto the Sixth. The ARGUMENT. Here Ulfin reads the art to Ulfinore Of wisely getting, and increasing Power. The Rivals to Verona haste, and there Young Goltho's frailty does too soon appear. Black Dalga's fatal beauty is reveal'd; But her descent and Story is conceal'd. 1 Old Ulfin parting now with Ulfinore, His study'd thoughts, and of a grave import Thus utter'd, as well read in ancient Lore; When prudence kept up greatness in the Court. 2 Heav'n guide thee, Son, through Honor's slipp'ry way; The Hill, which wary painfulness must climbe; And often rest, to take a full survey. Of every path, trod by Experienc'd Time. 3 Rise glorious with thy Master's hopeful Morn! His favour calls thee to his secret Breast; Great Gondibert! to spacious Empire born; Whose careful Head will in thy bosome rest. 4 Be good! and then in pitty soon be great! For vertuous men should toile to compass pow'r, Least when the Bad possess Dominion's Seat, We vainly weep for those whom they devour. 5 Our vertue without pow'r, but harmless is! The Good, who lazily are good at home, And safely rest in doing not amiss, Fly from the Bad, for fear of Martyrdome! 6 Be in thy greatness easie, and thy Brow Still cleer, and comforting as breaking Light; The Great, with bus'ness troubled, weakly bow; Pow'r should with publick Burdens walk upright! 7 We chearfulness, as innocence commend! The Great, may with benigne and civil Eyes The People wrong, yet not the wrong'd offend; Who feel most wrong, from those who them despise! 8 Since wrongs must be, Complaints must shew the Griev'd; And Favorites should walk still open Ear'd; For of the suing Croud half are reliev'd With the innate delight of being heard. 9 Thy greatness be in Armes! who else are great, Move but like Pageants in the People's view; And in foul weather make a scorn'd retreat; The Greeks their painted Gods in Armor drew! 10 Yield not in storms of State to that dislike Which from the People does to Rulers grow; Pow'r (Fortune's Sail) should not for threatnings strike; In Boats bestorm'd all check at those that row. 11 Courts little Arts contemn! dark Holes to save Retreated Pow'r, when fear does Friendship feigne; Poor Theeves retire to Woods! Chiefs, great, and brave, Draw out their Forces to the open Plaine! 12 Be by thy Vertue bold! when that Sun shines, All Art's false lights are with disgrace put out; Her straitness shews it self and crooked Lines; And her plain Text the Scepticks dare not doubt. 13 Revenge (weak Womens Valor, and in Men, The Ruffians Cowardise,) keep from thy Breast! The factious Palace is that Serpent's Den; Whom Cowards there, with secret slaughter Feast. 14 Revenge is but a braver Name for Fear, 'Tis Indians furious fear, when they are fed With valiant Foes; whose Hearts their Teeth must tear Before they boldly dare believe them dead. 15 VVhen thou giv'st death, thy Banners be display'd! And move not till an open Foe appears! Courts lurking war shews Justice is afraid; And no broad Sword, but a closs Ponyard wears. 16 To kill, shews Fear dares not more fears endure! VVhen wrong'd, destroy not with thy Foes thy fame; The Valiant by forgiving mischief, cure; And it is Heav'n's great conquest to reclame! 17 Be by thy bounty known! for since the needs Of life, so rudely press the bold and wise; The bountious heart, all but his God exceeds; VVhom bounty best makes known to Mortal Eies! 18 And to be bountiful, be rich! for those Fam'd Talkers, who in Schools did wealth despise, Taught doctrine, which at home would Empire lose, If not believ'd first by their Enemies. 19 And though in ruling Ministers of State, The People wretched poverty adore, (Which Fools call innocence, and wise Men hate As sloth) yet they rebell for being poore, 20 And to be rich, be diligent! Move on Like Heav'ns great Movers that inrich the Earth; Whose Moments sloth would shew the world undone, And make the Spring strait bury all her birth. 21 Rich are the diligent! who can command Time, Nature's stock! and could his Hour-glass fall, Would, as for seed of Stars, stoop for the sand; And by incessant Labour gather all. 22 Be kinde to Beauty! that unlucky Shrine! Where all Love's Thieves come bowing to their Prey; And honor steal; which Beauty makes divine: Be thou still kinde, but never to betray! 23 Heav'n study more in Nature, then in Schools! Let Nature's Image never by thee pass Like unmark'd Time; but those unthinking Fools Despise, who spie not Godhead through her Glass! 24 These precepts Ulfinore, with dutious care, In his Hearts Closet lock'd, his faithful Brest! And now the Rival-Friends for Court prepare; And much their Youth is by their haste exprest. 25 They yet ne'r saw Verona nor the Court; And expectation lengthens much their way; Since by that great Inviter urg'd, Report; And thither fly on Coursers of Relay, 26 E're to his Western Mines the Sun retir'd; They his great Mint for all those Mines behold, Verona, which in Towres to Heav'n aspir'd; Guilt doubly, for the Sun now guilt their gold. 27 They make their Entry through the Western Gate! A Gothick Arch! Where, on an Elephant Bold Clephes as the second Founder sate; Made to mock life, and onely life did want. 28 Still strange, and divers seem their Objects now; And still increase, where ere their Eyes they cast; Of lazy Pag'ant-Greatness, moving slow, And angry bus'ness, rushing on in haste. 29 All strange to them, as they to all appear; Yet less like strangers gaz'd then those they see; Who this glad day the Duke's Spectators were; To mark how with his fame his looks agree. 30 And guess that these are of his fighting Train, Renown'd in Youth; who by their wonder stay'd, And by their own, but slowly passage gain; But now much more their progress is delay'd: 31 For a black Beauty did her pride display Through a large Window, and in Jewels shon, As if to please the World, weeping for day, Night had put all her Starry Jewels on. 32 This Beauty gaz'd on both, and Ulfinore Hung down his Head, but yet did lift his Eyes; As if he fain would see a little more: For much, though bashful, she did beauty prise. 33 Goltho did like a blushless Statue stare; Boldly her practis'd boldness did out-look; And even for fear she would mistrust her snare, Was ready to cry out, that he was took! 34 She, with a wicked Woman's prosp'rous Art, A seeming modesty, the Window clos'd; Wisely delay'd his Eyes, since of his Heart She thought, she had sufficiently dispos'd. 35 And he thus strait complain'd! Ah Ulfinore, How vainly Glory has our Youth misled? The Winde which blowes us from the happy Shore, And drives us from the living to the Dead. 36 To Bloody slaughters, and perhaps of those Who might beget such beauties as this Maid; The Sleepy here are never wak'd with Foes; Nor are of ought but Ladies frowns afraid. 37 Ere he could more lament, a little Page, Clean, and perfum'd (one whom this Dame did breed To guess at ills, too manly for his age) Steps swiftly to him, and arrests his Steed. 38 With civil whisper cries, My Lady Sir!— At this, Goltho alights as swiftly post As Posters mount; by lingring loath to err, As Wind-bound Men, whose sloth their first Wind lost. 39 And when his Friend advis'd him to take care; He gravely, as a Man new potent grown, Protests he shall in all his Fortunes share; And to the House invites him as his own. 40 And, with a Rival's wisdom, Ulfinore Does hope, since thus blinde Love leads him astray, Where a false Saint he can so soon adore, That to Birtha ne'r will finde the way. 41 They enter, and ascend; and enter then Where Dalga with black Eyes does Sinners draw; And with her voice holds fast repenting Men; To whose warm Jett, light Goltho is but Straw. 42 Nicely as Bridegrooms, was her Chamber drest, Her Bed, as Brides; and richer then a Throne; And sweeter seem'd then the Circania's Nest, Though built in Eastern Groves of Cinamon. 43 The price of Princes pleasures; who her love (Though but false ware) at rates so costly bought; The wealth of many, but may hourly prove Spoils to some one by whom her self is caught. 44 She, sway'd by sinful Beauty's destiny, Findes her Tyrannick pow'r must now expire; Who ment to kindle Goltho with her Eye, But to her Breast has brought the raging fire. 45 Yet even in simple love she uses Art; Though weepings are from looser Eyes but leaks, Yet oldest Lovers scarce would doubt her heart; So well she weeps, and thus to Goltho speaks. 46 I might, if I should ask your pardon, Sir, Suspect that pitty which the noble feel When Women fail; but since in this I err To all my Sex, I would to Women kneel. 47 Yet happy were our Sex, could they excuse All breach of modesty, as I can mine; Since 'tis from passion which a Saint might use, And not appear less worthy of a Shrine. 48 For my brave Brother you resemble so Throughout your shape; who late in Combate fell; As you in that an inward vertue show, By which to me you all the World excell. 49 All was he, which the Good as greatness see, Or Love can like! in judgment match'd by none; Unless it fail'd in being kind to me; A crime forbid to all since he is gone. 50 For though I send my Eyes abroad, in hope Amongst the streams of Men still flowing here, To finde (which is my passions utmost scope) Some one that does his noble Image beare; 51 Yet still I live recluse; unless it seem A liberty too rude, that I in you His likeness at so high a rare esteem, As to believe your heart is kinde and true. 52 She casts on Ulfinore a sudden look; Stares like a Mountebank, who had forgot His Viol, and the cursed poison took By dire mistake before his Antidote. 53 Prays Goltho that his Friend may strait forbear Her presence; who (she said) resembled so Her noble Brother's cruel Murderer, As she must now expire, unless he go! 54 Goltho, still gravely vain, with formal Face Bids Ulfinore retire; and does pretend Almost to know her Parents, and the place, And even to swear her Brother was his Friend. 55 But wary Ulfinore (whose beautious Truth Did never but in plainest dress behold) Smiles, and remembers Tales, to forward Youth In Winter Nights by Country Matrons told: 56 Of witches Townes, where seeming Beauties dwell, All hair, and black within, Maides that can fly! Whose Palaces at Night, are smoky Hell, And in their beds their slaughter'd Lovers lie. 57 And though, the Sun now setting, he no Lights Saw burning blew, nor steam of Sulphur smelt; Nor took her Two black Meroen Maids for Sprites; Yet he a secret touch of honor felt. 58 For not the craft of Rivalship (though more Then States, wise Rivals study interest) Can make him leave his Friend, till he restore Some cold discretion to his burning Breast. 59 Though to his fears this cause now serious shows; Yet smiles he at his solemn loving Eye; For Lust in reading Beauty solemn grows As old Physitians in Anatomie. 60 Goltho (said he) 'tis easie to discern That you are grave, and think you should be so; Since you have bus'ness here of grave concern; And think that you this House and Lady know. 61 You'l stay, and have your sleep with musick fed; But little think to wake with Mandrakes grones; And by a Ghost be to a Garden led At midnight, strew'd with simple Lovers Bones: 62 This Goltho is inchantment, and so strange, So subt'ly false, that whilst I tell it you, I fear the spell will my opinion change, And make me think the pleasant Vision true. 63 Her dire black Eyes are like the Oxes Eye, Which in the Indian Ocean Tempest brings; Let's go! Before our Horses learn to fly, Ere she shew cloven Feet, and they get wings! 64 But high rebellious Love, when counsell'd, soon As sullen as rebuk'd Ambition grows; And Goltho would pursue what he should shun, But that his happy'r fate did interpose: 65 For at the Garden Gate, a Summons, loud Enough, to shew authority, and haste, Brought cares to Dalga's Brow; which like a Cloud Did soon her shining beauty over-cast. 66 Like Thieves surpris'd, whil'st they divide their Prise, Her Maids run and return through ev'ry Room; Still seeming doubtful where their safety lies; All speaking with their looks, and all are dumb. 67 She, who to dangers could more boldly wake, With words, swift as those errands which her heart Sends out in glances, thus to Goltho spake: My Mother, Sir! Alass! You must depart! 68 She is severe, as dying Confessors, As jealous as unable Husbands are, She Youth in Men, like age in Maids abhors; And has more Spies then any civil Warre. 69 Yet would you but submit to be conceal'd, I have a Closet secret as my Brest, Which is to Men, nor Day, no more reveal'd, Then a closse Swallow in his Winters Nest. 70 To this good Goltho did begin to yield; But Ulfinore (who doubts that it may tend To base retreat, unless they quit the Field) Does by example govern and defend. 71 And now his Eyes even ake with longingness, Ready to break their Strings, to get abroad To see this Matron, by whose sole access Dalga in all her furious hopes is aw'd. 72 And as he watch'd her civil Mercury, The hopeful Page; he saw him entrance give, Not to a Matron, still prepar'd to die; But to a Youth wholly design'd to live. 73 He seem'd the Heir to prosp'rous Parents toiles; Gay as young Kings, that woo in forraign Courts; Or youthful Victors in their Persian spoiles; He seem'd like Love and Musick made for sports. 74 But wore his clothing loose, and wildly cast, As Princes high with Feasting, who to wine Are seldom us'd: shew'd warm, and more unbrac't Then Ravishers, oppos'd in their designe. 75 This Ulfinore observ'd, and would not yet In civil pitty, undeceive his Friend; But watch'd the signes of his departing Fit; Which quickly did in bashful silence end. 76 To the Dukes Palace they inquir'd their way; And as they slowly rod, a grave excuse Griev'd Goltho frames; vowing he made this stay For a discov'ry of important use. 77 If Sir, (said he) we heedlesly pass by Great Towns, like Birds that from the Country come But to be skar'd, and on to Forrests fly, Let's be no travail'd Fools, but roost at home. 78 I see (reply'd his Friend) you nothing lack Of what is painful, curious, and discreet In Travailers; else would you not look back So often to observe this House, and Street: 79 Drawing your City Mapp with Coasters care; Not onely marking where safe Channels run, But where the Shelves, and Rocks, and Dangers are; To teach weak Strangers what they ought to shun. 80 But, Goltho, fly from Lust's experiments! Whose heat we quench much sooner then asswage; To quench the Furnace-Lust, stop all the vents; For, give it any Air, the flames will rage. FINIS. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MADAGASCAR, With other POEMS. BY S? WILLIAM D'AVENANT. IF THESE POEMS LIVE, MAY THEIR MEMORIES BY WHOM THEY WERE CHERISHED, ENDIM. PORTER, H. JERMIN, LIVE WITH THEM. To my worthy Friend Mr. William D'avenant; upon his Poem of Madagascar, which he writ to the most Illustrious Prince Rupert. I am compell'd by your commands to write I'th' Frontis-piece of this, and sure I might With quaint conceits, here to the World set forth The merit of the Poem, and your worth; Had I well fancy'd reasons to begin; And a choyce Mould, to cast good Verses in: But wanting these, what power (alas) have I To write of any thing? will men rely On my opinion? which in Verse, or Prose, Hath just that credit, which we give to those That sagely whisper, secrets of the Court. Having but Lees, for Essence, from Report. And that's the knowledge which belongs to me; For by what's said, I guess at Poetry. As when I hear them read strong-lines I cry: Th'are rare, but cannot tell you rightly why: And now I finde this quality was it, That made some Poet cite me for a wit: Now God forgive him for that huge mistake! If he did know; but with what paines I make A Verse, hee'ld pittie then my wretched case; For at the birth of each, I twist my Face, As if I drew a Tooth; I blot, and write, Then look as pale, as some that go to fight: With the whole Kennel of the Alphabet, I hunt sometimes an hour, one Rime to get: What I approv'd of once, I streight deny, Like an unconstant Prince, then give the lye To my own invention, which is so poor, As here I'de kiss your hands, and say no more; Had I not seen a childe with Sizors cut, A folded Paper unto which was put More chance then skill, yet when you open it, You'd think it had been done, by Art and Wit: So I (perhaps) may light upon some straine, Which may in this your good opinion gaine; And howsoever, if it be a plot You may be certain that in this, y'have got A foyle to set your Jewel off, which comes From Madagascar, scenting of rich gummes; Before the which, my lay conceits will smell, Like an abortive Chick, destroy'd i'th' shell: Yet something I must say, may it prove fit; I'le do the best I can and this is it. What lofty fancy was't possest your braine, And caus'd you soare into so high a straine! Did all the Muses joyne, to make this piece Excel what we have had, from Rome or Greece? Or did your strive, to leave it as a Friend To speak your praises, when there is an end Of your Mortality? if you did so, Envy will then, scarce find you out a Foe: But let me tell you (Friend) the heightning came, From the reflection of Prince Rupert's name; Whose glorious Genius cast into your Soul, Divine conceits, such as are fit t'inrole In great Apollo's court, there to remain For future ages to transcribe again: For such a Poem, in so sweet a stile, As yet was never landed on this Isle: And could I speak your praises at each Pore, Twere little for the work; it merits more. Endimion Porter. To my Friend William D'avenant; upon his Poem of Madagascar. What mighty Princes Poets are? those things The great ones stick at, and our very Kings Lay down, they venture on; and with great ease Discover, conquer, what, and where they please. Some Flegmatick Sea-Captaine, would have staid For mony now, or Victuals; not have waid Anchor without'em; Thou (Will.) do'st not stay So much as for a Wind, but go'st away, Land'st, View'st the Country; fight'st, putt'st all to rout Before another cou'd be putting out! And now the news in Town is, Dav'nant's come From Madagascar, Fraught with Laurel home, And welcome (Will) for the first time, but prithee In thy next Voyage, bring the Gold too with thee. J. Suckling. On his other Poems. Thou hast redeemed us (Will.) and future times, Shall not account unto the Age's crimes Dearth of pure Wit: since the great Lord of it (Donne) parted hence, no man has ever writ So near him, in's own way: I would commend Particulars, but then, how should I end Without a Volume? Ev'ry Line of thine Would aske (to praise it right) Twenty of mine J. Suckling. To Will. D'avenant my Friend. When I beheld, by warrant from thy Pen, A Prince rigging our Fleets, arming our Men, Conducting to remotest shores our force (Without a Dido to retard his course) And thence repelling in successful fight Th' usurping Foe (whose strength was all his right) By two brave Heroes, (whom we justly may By Homer's Ajax or Achilles lay,) I doubt the Author of the Tale of Troy, With him, that makes his Fugitive enjoy The Carthage Queen, and think thy Poem may Impose upon Posterity, as they Have done on us: What though Romances lie Thus blended with more faithful Historie? We, of th' adult'rate mixture not complaine, But thence more Characters of Vertue gaine: More pregnant Patterns of transcendent Worth, Then barren and insipid Truth brings forth: So oft the Bastard nobler fortune meets, Then the dull Issue of the lawful sheets. Thomas Carew. To my Friend, William D'avenant. I crowded 'mongst the first, to see the Stage (Inspir'd by thee) strike wonder in our Age, By thy bright fancie dazled; Where each Sceane Wrought like a charme, and forc't the Audience leane To th' passion of thy Pen: Thence Ladies went (Whose absence Lovers sigh'd for) to repent There unkinde scorne; And Countries who by art Made love before, with a converted heart, To wed those Virgins, whom they woo'd t' abuse: Both rendred Hymen's pros'lits by thy Muse. But others who were proofe 'gainst Love, did sit To learn the subtile Dictates of thy Wit; And as each profited, took his degree, Master, or Batchelor, in Comedie. Who on the Stage, though since they venter'd not Yet on some Lord, or Lady, had their plot Of gaine, or favor: Ev'ry nimble jest They speak of thine, b'ing th' entrance to a Feast, Or nearer whisper: Most thought fit to be So far concluded Wits, as they knew thee. But here the Stage thy limit was. Kings may Find proud ambition humbled at the Sea, Which bounds dominion: But the nobler flight Of Poesie, hath a supreamer right To Empire, and extends her large command Where ere th'invading Sea assaults the land. Ev'n Madagascar (which so oft hath been Like a proud Virgin tempted, yet still seen Th' Enemy Court the Wind for flight) doth lie A trophie now of thy Wits Victorie: Nor yet disdains destruction to her state, Encompast with thy Laurel in her fate. William Habington. Madagascar. A POEM, Written to PRINCE RUPERT. My Soul, this Winter, has been twice about To shift her narrow Mansion, and look out; To aire her yet unpractis'd wings, and trie Where Soules are entertain'd when Bodies die: For this intended journey was to cleare Some subtile humane doubts, that vex her here And for no other cause; how ere the Court Believe (whose cruell wits turn all to sport) Twas not to better my Phylosophie That I would mount, and travell through the Skie, As if I went, on natures embassie; Whose Legate there, Religion termes a Spie. But these sick offers to depart, they call A weariness of Life, each Spring, and Fall: And this beliefe (though well resolv'd before) Made me so sullen, that I'le die no more Than old Chaldean Prophets in their sleep; Who still some reliques of their Soules, would keep, As gage for the returne of what they sent, For visions to the starry Firmament. Thus in a Dream, I did adventure out Just so much Soule, as Sinners giv'n to doubt Of after usage, dare forgoe a while: And this swift Pilot steer'd unto an Isle, Between the Southern Tropick and the Line; Which (noble Prince) my prophecie calls thine: There, on a Christal Rock I sate, and saw The empire of the Winds, new kept in awe, By things so large, and weighty, as did press Waves to Bubles, or what unswell'd to less: The Sea for shelter hastned to the shore; Sought harbor for it self, not what it bore: So well these Ships could rule; where ev'ry Saile, The subdu'd Winds, court with so milde a gale, As if the spacious Navy lay adrift, Sailes swell'd, to make them comely more than swift: And then I spi'd (as cause of this command) Thy mighty Uncles Trident in thy hand, By which mysterious figure I did call Thee chiefe, and universal Admirall! For well our Northern Monarch knowes, how ere The Sea is dully held, the proper spheare Wherein that Trydent swayes, yet; in his hand It turnes strait to a Scepter when on land: And soon this wise assertion prov'd a truth; For when thy self, with thy advent'rous Youth Were disimbarqu'd; strait with one lib'rall minde, That long-lost, scatter'd-parcell of Mankinde, Who from the first disorder'd throng did stray And then fix here, now yield unto thy sway: On Olive-trees, their Quivers empty hung, Their arrowes were unplum'd, their bowes unstrung: But some from farr, with jealous Opticks trace Lines of thy Mothers beauty in thy face: By which, so much thou seem'st the God of love, That with tumultuous haste they strait remove, And hide, their Magazin of Archerie; Lest what was their defence, might now supply Thy Godhead, which is harmless yet, but know When thou shalt head a Shaft, and draw a Bow, Each then thou conquerst, must a Lover be; The worst estate of their Captivity. What sound is that! whose concord makes a jarre? 'Tis noise in Peace, though harmony in Warr: The Drum, whose doubtfull Musick doth delight The willing eare, and the unwilling fright. Had wet Orion chosen to lament His griefs at Sea, on such an Instrument; Perhaps the martiall Musick might incite The Sword-fish, Thrasher, and the Whale to fight, But not to dance; the Dolphin he should lack, Who to delight his eare, did load his back, And now as Thunder calls ere Stormes doe rise; Yet not forewarnes, 'till just they may surprise; Till the assembling clouds are met, to powre Their long provided fury in one showre; Even so this little thunder of the Drum, Foretold a danger just when it was come: When strait mine Eye, might ratifie mine Eare; And see that true, which heard, was but my feare: For in a firme well-order'd body stood, Erected Pikes, like a young leafless Wood; And that shew'd dark, they were so close combin'd; And ev'ry narrow File was double lin'd; But with such nimble Ministers of fire, That could so quickly charge, so soon retire, That shot so fast; to say it lightned were No praise, unto a Gunners motion there; Nor yet to say, it lightned ev'ry where; Their number thence, not swiftness would appeare; Since so incessant swift; that in mine eye, Lightning seem'd slow, and might be taught to flie! 'Tis lawfull then to say, thou didst appear To wonder much, although thou couldst not feare: Thy knowledge (Prince) were younger then thy time, If not amaz'd; to see in such a clime, Where Science is so new, Men so exact, In Tactick Arts, both to designe, and act. These from unweildy Ships (the day before) The weary Seas disburdened on the Shore: In envy of thy hopes they hither came; And Envy men in warr Ambition name; Ambition, Valour; but 'tis valor's shame When envy feeds it more then noble Fame: Strait I discern'd by what their Ensigne weares, They are of those ambitious Wanderers; Whose avaricious thoughts would teach them run, As long continu'd journeys as the Sun: And make the title of their strength, not right, As known, and universal as his light: For they believe their Monarch hath subdu'd Already such a spacious latitude: That sure, the good old Planet's bus'ness is Of late, only to visit what is his: And those faire beams, which he did think his own Are tribute now, and he, his subject grown; Yet not impair'd in title, since they call Him kindly, his Surveyour-Generall. Now give me Wine! and let my fury rise, That what my travail'd Soul's immortall eyes With joy, and wonder saw, I may reherse To curious Eares, in high, immortall verse! Two of this furious Squadron did advance; Commanded to comprise the publick chance In their peculiar fates: Their swords they drew: And two, whose large renown their Nation knew, Two of thy party (Prince) they call'd to try By equall duell such a Victory, As gives the Victor's side a full command Of what possess'd by both, is neithers Land, And this to save the Peoples common blood; By whom, although no cause is understood; Yet Princes being vex'd they must take care To doe not what they ought, but what they dare: Their reason on their courage must rely, Though they alike the quarrel justifie, And in their Princes kind indiff'rent eye Are dutyous Fooles, that either kill, or die. This safe agreement by the gen'rall voice Was ratifi'd with vowes, then straight thy choice For the encounter (Prince) with greedy eye I did intirely view, and both I spie March to the List, whilst others cheerfull look Fore-told glad hopes, of what they undertook. Their lookes; where forc'd-state-clouds, nere strive to lowre, As if sweet feature, bus'ness could make sowre: Where solemn sadness of a new court face, Nere meant to signifie their pow'r, or place. You may esteem them Lovers by their haire; The colour warnes no Lady to despaire; And nature seem'd to prove their stature such, As took not scantly from her, nor too much: So tall, we can't mis-name their stature length, Nor think't less made for comliness, then strength. Their hearts are more, than what we noble call, And still make envy weary of her Gall. So gentle soft; their valours with more ease, Might be betray'd to suffer than displease: Compar'd to Lovers, Lovers were undone; Since still the best gain by comparison. Of these, the Godlike Sidney was a Type, Whose fame still grows, and yet is ever ripe; Like Fruits of Paradise, which nought could blast But ignorance; for a desire to taste, And know, produc'd no curse; but neut'rall will, When knowledge made indiff'rent, good, and ill. So whilst our judgment keeps unmix'd, and pure, Our Sidney's full grown Fame will still indure: Sidney, like whom these Champions strive to grace, The silenc'd remnant of poor Orpheus race. First those, whom mighty Numbers shall inspire; Then those, whose easier art can touch his Lyre. And they protect, those who with wealthier fate, Old Zeuxis lucky Pensill imitate. And those, who teach Lysippus Imag'ry; Formes, that if once alive, would never die! Which though no offices of life they taste, Yet, like th' Elements (life's preservers) last! An Art, that travailes much, deriv'd to us From pregnant Rome, to Rome from Ephesus! But whether am I fled? A Poets song. When love directs his praise, is ever long. The challenge was aloud, whil'st ev'ry where Men strive to shew their hopes, and hide their feare, They now stood opposite, and neer: a while Their Eyes encounter'd, then in scorn they smile. Such did disguise the fury of his heart, A safe, and temp'rate exercise of Art Seem'd to invite those thrusts they most decline, Receive, and then return in one true line, As if, all Archymedes science were In duell both express'd, and better'd there. Each strove the others judgment to suppress: Stood stiffe, as if their postures were in Brass. But who can keep his cold wise temper long, VVhen Honour warmes him, and his blood is young: Those subtill figures, they in judgment chose As guards secure, in rage they discompose: Now Hazard is the Play, Courage the Maine, VVhich, if it hits at first, assures the gain: But Honor throwes at all, and in this strife, VVhen Honor playes, how poor a stake is life? VVhich soon (alass!) the adverse Second found: Made wise, by the example of a wound: But Gamsters wisdome ever comes too late, So dear 'tis bought, of that false Merchant Fate: For our bold Second by that wound had wone The treasure of his strength; whilst quite undone, He shrunke from this unlucky sport: but now More angry wrinckles on his Rivals brow Appear'd, than hundred Lions weare; and all His strength, he ventures on our Principall: VVho entertain'd his streame of fury so As Seas meet Rivers whom they force to flow: It is repulse makes Rivers swell, and he Forc'd back, got courage from our victory: Rivers, that Seas do teach to rage, are tost, And troubled for their pride, then quickly lost: So he was taught that anger, which he spent To make the others wrath more prevalent, For in the next assault he felt the best, First part of Man, (the Monarch of his brest) To sicken in its warme, and narrow Throne, His Rivals hasty Soule, to shades unknowne VVas newly fled, but his made greater haste, His feares had so much sense of sufferings paste: Such danger he discern'd in's Victors eye, VVhom he believ'd, so skill'd in victory; As if his Soul should near his Body stay, The cruell Heavens, would teach him find a way To kill that too, by which, no pride (we see) Can make us so prophane as misery? This when their Campe beheld, they strait abjure That pitty in their vow; which to secure The publick blood, ventur'd their hopes, and fame On Two, cause they could die, were censur'd tame; And to exhort, such vex'd, and various Minds, VVere in a storme, to reconcile the VVinds, VVith whisper'd precepts of Philosophy: Armes, and Religion, seldome can comply. Their Faith they break, and in a body draw Their looser strength, to give the Victors law. Charge! charge! the Battel is begun! and now I saw thy Uncles anger in thy brow: Which like Heavens fire, doth seldome force assume, Or kindle till 'tis fit, it should consume: Heavens slow, unwilling fire; that would not fall, Till two injurious Cities seem'd to call With their loud sins, and when 'twas time it must Destroy; although it was severely just To those, so much perverted in their will; The righteous saw the fire, yet fear'd no ill. So careless safe, here all the Natives were, Who stood, as if too innocent to feare, As if they knew, thy Uncle bred thy fate, And his just anger thou didst imitate. But thy proud foes, who thought the Morne did rise, For no chief cause, but to salute their eyes; Are now enform'd by Death, it may grow Night With them, yet others still enjoy the light: For strait (me thought) their perish'd Bodies lay To soyle the Ground, they conquer'd yesterday. O, Why is valour priz'd at such a rate? Or if a Vertue. Why so fool'd by Fate? That Land, achiev'd with patient toyle, and might Of emulous encounter in the fight They must not onely yeld, when they must die, But dead, it for the Victor fructifie. And now our Drums so fill each adverse Eare, Their fellowes groanes, want roome to enter there; Like Ships near Rocks, when stormes are grown so high, They cannot warne each other with their cry: Evn so, not hearing what would make them flie, All stay'd, and sunke, for sad societie: Their wounds are such, the Neighb'ring Rivers need No Springs to make them flow, but what they bleed: Where Fishes wonder at their red-dy'd flood, And by long nourishment on humane blood, May grow so neer a kin to men, that he Who feeds on them hereafter, needs must be Esteem'd as true a Caniball, as those Whose luscious diet is their conquer'd Foes. Sure Adam, when himself he first did spie So singular, and only in his eye; Yet knew, all to that single self pertain'd, Which the Sun saw, or Elements sustain'd; He not believ'd, a race from him might come So num'rous, that to make new off-spring roome, Is now the best excuse of Nature, why Men long in growth, so easily must die. Eden, which God did this first Prince allow, But as his Privy-Garden then, is now A spacious Country found; else we supplie With dreames, not truth, long lost Geographie: And each high Island then (though nere so wide) Was but his Mount, by Nature fortifi'd; And every Sea, wherein those Islands float, Most aptly then, he might have call'd his Moat. Parts, and divisions were computed small, When rated by his measure that had all: And all was Adams when the world was new; Then strait that all, succeeded to a few; Whilst Men were in their size, not number strong; But since, each Couple is become a Throng: Which is the cause we busie ev'ry winde (That studious Pilots in their compass finde) For Lands unknown: where those who first do come Are not held strangers, but arrive at home; Yet he that next shall make his visit there, Is punish'd for a Spie and wanderer: Not that Man's nature is averse from peace; But all are wisely jealous of increase: For Eaters grow so fast, that we must drive Our Friends away to keep our selves alive: And Warr would be less needfull, if to die, Had been as pleasant as to multiplie. Forgive me Prince, that this aspiring Flame (First kindled as a light, to shew thy fame) Consumes so fast, and is mis-spent so long, Ere my chief Vision is become my Song, Thy self I saw, quite tir'd with victory; As weary grown to kill, as they to die: Whilst some at last, thy mercy did enjoy 'Cause 'twas less paines, to pardon than destroy; And thy compassion did thy Army please, In meere beliefe, it gave thy valour ease. Here in a calme began thy regall sway; Which with such cheerfull hearts, all did obey, As if no Law, were juster than thy word: Thy Scepter still were safe, without a Sword. And here Chronologers pronounce thy stile; The first true Monarch of the Golden Isle: An Isle, so seated for predominance, Where Navall strength, its power can so advance, That it may tribute take, of what the East Shall ever send in traffique to the West. He that from cursed Mahomet derives His sinfull blood: the Sophy too, that strives To prove, he keepes that very Chaire in's Throne, The Macedonian Youth last sate upon: And he, whose wilder pride, makes him abhor All but the Sun, for his Progenitor; Whose Mother sure, was ravish'd in a dreame, By some o're hot, lascivious Noon-day-beame; From whence, he calls himself, The wealth of sight, The Morn's Executor, the Heire of Light: And he, that thinks his rule extends so farr, He hopes, the former Three his Vassals are: Compar'd to him, in Warr he rates them less, Than Corporalls; than Constables in peace: And hopes the mighty Presbiter stands bare In rev'rence of his name, and will not dare To weare (though sick) his purple Turband on Within a hundred Leagues, of his bright throne. These Mortall Gods, for traffique still disperse Their envy'd wealth, throughout the Universe; In Caracks, built so wide, that they want roome In narrow Seas; or in a Junck, whose wombe So swels, as could our wonder be so mad, To think that Boats, or Ships their sexes had; Who them beheld, would simply say, sure these Are neare their time, and big with Pinnaces: Yet though so large, and populous, they all Must tribute pay, unto thy Admirall, Now wealth (the cause, and the reward of War) Is greedily explor'd: some busie are In Virgin Mines; where shining Gold they spie, That darkens the Celestiall Chymicks eye: I wish'd my Soul had brought my body here, Not as a Poet, but a Pioner. Some near the deepest shore are sent to dive; VVhilst with their long retentive breath they strive To root up Corall-Trees, where Mermaids lie, Sighing beneath those Precious boughs, and die For absence of their scaly Lovers lost In midnight stormes, about the Indian coast. Some find old Oysters, that lay gaping there For ev'ry new, fresh floud, a hundred year; From these they rifle Pearles, whose pond'rous size Sinks weaker divers, when they strive to rise: So big, on Carckonets were never seen, But where some well-trus'd-Giantess is Queen; For though th'are Orient, and designe to deck, Their weight would yoke a tender Ladies Neck. Some climbe, and search the Rocks, till each have found A Saphyr, Ruby, and a Diamond: That which the Sultan's glist'ring Bride doth weare, To these would but a Glowormes eye appeare: The Tuscan Dukes compar'd, shewes sick, and dark; These living Stars, and his a dying spark. And now I saw (what urg'd my wonder more) Black Sudds of Amber-Greece, float to the shore: Whilst rude dull Mariners, who hardly can Distingish Buffe, or Hides, from Cordovan, (Since Gloves they never weare) this Oyntment use Not to perfume, but supple their parch'd Shooes. Now others hasten to the Woods, and there Such Fruits for tast and odor, ev'ry where Are seen; that the Merabolan by some Is slighted as a course sower winter plumme. Then new temptation make them all in love VVith wand'ring, till invited to a Grove, They strait those silken little VVeavers spie, That work so fast on leaves of Mulbery: The Persian VVorme (whose weary summer toyles So long hath been the rusling Courtiers spoiles) Compar'd to these, lives ever lazily, And for neat spinning is a bungling Flie! Such hopes of wealth discern'd, 'tis hard to say How gladly reason did my faith obey; As if that miracle would now appear, Which turnes a Poet to an Usurer: But reason soon will without faith conspire, To make that easie which we much desire: Nor, Prince, will I despaire, though all is thine, That Pioners now dig from ev'ry Mine; Though all, for which on slipp'ry Rocks they strive; Or gather when in Seas they breathless dive; Though Poets such unlucky Prophets are, As still foretell more blessings than they share; Yet when thy noble choice appear'd, that by Their Combat first prepar'd thy victory; Endimion, and Arigo; who delight In Numbers, and make strong my Muses flight! These when I saw, my hopes could not abstaine, To think it likely I might twirle a Chaine On a judicial Bench: learn to demurre, And sleep out trials in a Gown of Furre: Then reconcile the rich, for Gold-fring'd-gloves, The poor for God-sake, or for Sugar-loaves! When I perceiv'd, that Cares on Wealth rely, That I was destin'd for authority, And early Gowts; my Soul in a strange fright From this rich Isle began her hasty flight; And to my halfe dead Body did returne, Which new inspir'd, rose cheerfull as the Morne. Heroick Prince, may still thy acts, and name, Become the wonder and discourse of Fame; May ev'ry Laurell, ev'ry Mirtle Bough, Be strip'd for Wreaths, t'adorne, and load thy brow; Triumphant Wreaths, which cause they never fade, Wise elder times, for Kings and Poets made: And I deserve a little sprig of Bay, To weare in Greece on Homers Holy-day; Since I assume, when I thy Battels write, That very flame, which warm'd thee in the fight. ELIZIUM. To the Duchess of Buckingham. MADAM, So sleeps the Anchoret on his cheap bed, (Whose sleep wants only length to prove him dead) As I last night, whom the swift wings of Thought, Convey'd to see what our bold faith had taught; Elizium, where restored formes nere fade Where growth can need no seeds, nor light a shade; The joyes which in our flesh, through fraile expence Of strength, through age, were lost t'our injur'd sense, We there do meet agen; and those we taste Anew, which though devour'd, yet ever last: The scatter'd treasure of the Spring, blown by Autumn's rude winds from our discovery; Lillies, and Roses; all that's faire and sweet, There reconcil'd to their first roots we meet; There, only those triumphant Lovers reign, Whose passions knew on earth so little stain, Like Angels they ne're felt what sexes meant; Vertue was first their nature, then intent: There, toyling Victors safely are possest, With fervent youth, eternity, and rest; But they were such, who when they got the field; To teach the conquer'd, victorie, could yield Themselves again; as if true glory were To bring the foe to courage, not to feare. There are no talking Greeks, who their blood lost, Nor for the cause, but for a Theame to boast; As if they strove enough for Fame, that sought To have their Battels better told, than fought. There I a Vestal's Shadow first did spy, Who when alive with holy huswifry, Trick'd up in Lawne, and flow'ry Wreathes (each hand Cleane as her thoughts) did 'fore the Altar stand: So busie still, strewing her Spice, and then Removing Coales, vexing the Fire agen, As if some queasie Goddess had profess'd, To taste no smoak that day, but what she dress'd: This holy coyle she living kept; but farre. More busie now, with more delightful care Than when she watch'd the consecrated Flame, Sh'attends the Shade of gentle Buckingham; Who their unenvy'd sins, with Chaplets crown'd: And with wise scorn, smiles on the Prophets vvound; He call'd it so, for though it touch'd his heart, His Nation feels the rancour, and the smart. To the Lord D. L. upon his Marriage. VVe that are Orpheus Sons, and can inherit By that great title, nought but's num'rous spirit; His broken Harpe, &amp; when we're tir'd with moan A few small Trees of Bay to hang it on. We that successive can claime no more, From such a poor unlucky Ancestor; Must now (my Noble Lord) take thrifty care, To know, what modern wealth the Muses share? Or how it is dispos'd? and strait we finde Great, pow'rful Love, hath bount'ously resign'd Into your happy Armes, the Chief, and Best, Of all that our ambitious hopes possest: Your noble Bride; to whose eternal Eyes, We daily offer'd wreathes in Sacrifice: Whose warmth gave Laurel growth, whose ev'ry beame, Was first our influence, and then our theame: Whose brest (too narrow for her heart) was still Her reasons Throne, and prison to her will: And since, this is your willing faith, 'tis fit What all the kinde, and wiser Starres commit Unto your charge, be with such eager love, And soft endearments us'd, as well may prove, They meant, when first they taught you how to wooe, She should be happy, and the Muses too. Live still, the pleasure of each other sight; To each, a new made wonder, and delight; Though two, yet both so much one constant minde, That t'will be art, and mistery to finde (Your thoughts and wishes, being still the same) From which of eithers loving heart they came. A Journey into Worcestershire. These who (if kinder Destinies shall please) May all dye rich, though they love Wit and ease; And I, whom some odd hum'rous Planets bid To register the doughty acts they did, Took horse; leaving ith'Town, ill Plays, sowre Wines Fierce Serjeants and the plague; besides of mine An Ethnick Taylor too, that was far worse Than these, or what just Heaven did ever curse. Scarce was the busie City left behind, But from the South arose a busier Winde; Which sent us so much raine, each man did wish, His Hands and Legs were Finnes, his Horse a Fish, Dull as a thick-skull'd-Justice, drunk with Sloth; Or Alderman, (far gone in Capon broth) We all appear'd, no man gave breath to thought; But like a silent Traytor in a Vault, Digg'd on our way; or as we Traytors were T'our selves, and jealous of each others Eare: And as i'th Worlds great Showre, some that did spie (Hors'd on the Plaines) Rivers, and Seas drew nigh; Spurr'd on apace; in fear all lost their time, That could not reach a ground where they might climbe; So we did never think us safe, until We had attain'd the Top o'th first high Hill: And now it clear'd so to my travail'd Eie, Looks a round yellow Dane, when he doth spie Neer his puissant Arme, a boule so full, That it may fill his Bladder, and his skull, As Phoebus at this moysture falne; who laught, To see such plenty for his morning draught: But like Chamelions Colours that decay But seemingly to give new colours way; So our false griefs, had not themselves outworn, But step'd aside, to vary in returne. Bear witness World! for now my tir'd Horse stood, As I, a Vaulter were, and he were Wood: As if some Student fierce, the day before Had spur'd his full half Crown from him, or more. Endimion cryes away! what make we here? To draw a Map, or gather Juniper? More cruel then Shrove-Prentices, when they (Drunk in a Brothel House) are bid to pay; Or than the Bawd at Sessions, to that vilde Indicted Rout, which first her House until'de, Is now the Captaine, who laughing swore; thus, Each puny Poet rides his Pegasus. But what's the cause my Lord spurs on amaine, As if t'outride a Tartar, not the Raine; Some such swift Tartar as might safely say, To an inviting friend, that tempts his stay; Farewell, thou seest the Sun declin'd long since, And I'm to sup a Hundred miles from hence. My Lord (methought) as he had thought this same, Rod post, to eat that supper ere he came. And now, my Mule moves too; but with such speed, As Pris'ners to a Psalme, that cannot read: Yet we reach'd Wickham, with the early night: Which to describe to Eares, or draw to sight; For scituation, or for forme, for height, For strength, or magnitude, (would in good faith) But stale the price o'th Map, small credit be T'our Poem, less to our Geographie: Or as your riding Academicks use, To toyle, and vex, a long fed mutton-Muse, With taking the circumference of mine Host, Of his Wives sumitrie, were time worst lost; Since nor Taurentius, nor Van-dike, have yet Command to draw them for the King in great. He that to night rul'd each delight'd breast, Gave to the pallat of each Ear a Feast; With joy of pledges made our sowre wind sweet, And nymble as the leaping juyce of Crete; Was brave Endimion, whose triumphs clear, From cruel Tyranny, or too nice fear; Having wit still ready, and no huge sinne To cause a sadness that might keep it in, Let fly at all; the shafts were keene; and when They miss'd to pierce, he strongly drew agen. But sleep, whom Constables obey, though they Have twenty Bills to keep him off till day: Sleep, whom th'high tun'd Cloth-worker, Weaver call, Nor Cobler shril, with Catches or his Aule, Knowes to resist, seal'd up our lips, and sight; Making us blind, and silent as the Night. Our other Sallies, and th'adventures we Achiev'd, deserve new braine, new Historie. To Endimion Porter. I gave when last I was about to die; The Poets of this Isle a Legacie; Each so much wealth, as a long union brings T' industrious States, or Victorie to Kings: So much as hope's clos'd Eies, could wish to see, Or tall Ambition reach; I gave them thee. But as rich Men, who in their sickness mourne That they must go, and never more returne, To be glad Heirs unto themselves, to take Again, what they unwillingly forsake; As those bequeath, their treasure, when they dye, Not out of love, but sad necessity; So I (they thought) did cunningly resigne Rather then give, what could no more be mine: And they receiv'd thee not, from bounteous chance, Or me, but as their own inheritance. This, when I heard, I cancell'd my fond Will; Tempted my faith to my Physitians skil; To purchase health sung praises in his Ear More than the living of the Dead would hear, For though our gifts, buy care, nought justly payes Physitians love, but faith, their art, but praise: Which I observ'd; now walk, as I should see A death of all things, save thy memory, But if this yearly Vintage shall create New wishes in my blood, to celebrate Endimion thee thy Muse, and thy large heart, Thy wisdom that hath taught the world an art How (not enform'd by cunning) courtship may Subdue the minde, and not the man betray, If me (thy priest) our curled Youth assigne, To wash our Fleet-street Altars with new Wine; I will (since 'tis to thee a Sacrifice) Take care, that plenty swell not into vice, Lest by a fiery surfeit I be led; Once more to grow devout in a strange bed, Lest through kind weakness in decay of health, Or vanity to shew my utmost wealth; I should again bequeath thee when I die, To haughty Poets as a Legacie. To the Queen, entertain'd at night by the Countess of Anglesey. Faire as unshaded Light; or as the Day In its first birth; when all the Year was May; Sweet, as the Altars smoak, or as the new Unfolded Bud, sweld by the early dew; Smooth, as the face of waters first appear'd, Ere Tides began to strive, or Winds were heard: Kind as the willing Saints, and calmer farre, Than in their sleeps forgiven Hermits are: You that are more, then our discreter feare Dares praise, with such full Art, what make you here? Here, where the Summer is so little seen, That leaves (her cheapest wealth) scarce reach at green You come, as if the silver Planet were Misled a while from her much injur'd Sphere, And t'ease the travailes of her beames to night, In this small Lanthorn would contract her light. In remembrance of Master William Shakespire. ODE 1. 1 Beware (delighted Poets!) when you sing To welcome Nature in the early Spring: Your num'rous Feet not tread The banks of Avon; for each Flowre (As it nere knew a Sun or Showre) Hangs there, the pensive head. 2 Each Tree, whose thick and spreading growth hath made Rather a Night beneath the Boughs, then shade, (Unwilling now to grow.) Looks like the Plume a Captain weares, Whose rifled Falls are steept i'th teares Which from his last rage flow. 3 The pitious River wept it self away Long since (Alas!) to such a swift decay; That reach the Map, and look If you a River there can spie: And for a River your mock'd Eye, Will finde a shallow Brooke. To the Lady Bridget Kingsmill sent with Mellons after a report of my Death. Madam, that Ghosts have walk'd; and kindly did Convey Men heretofore to Money hid; That they wear Chaines, which rattle 'till they make More noyse, than injured Ale-wives at a Wake; All this is free to faith, but Sozomine, Nor th' Abbot Tretenheim, nor Rhodigine, Nor the Jew Tripho, though they all defend Such dreams, can urge one Ghost that verses pend: Therefore, be pleas'd to think, when these are read; I am no Ghost, nor have been three weeks dead. Yet Poets that so nobly vaine have been, To want so carelesly, till want prove sin; Through avarice of late, to th' Arches sent, To know the chief within my Testament: And th' Aldermen by Charter, title lay ('Cause writ 'ith City's Verge) to my new play: So if the Proclamations, kind, nice, care Keep you not (Madam) from our black raw Aire, Next Term, you'l find it own'd thus on each Wall Writ by the Lord May'r, and acted at Guild-Hall. But then I must be dead, which if you will In curteous pitty feare, and suspect still; These Mellons shall approach your pensive Eye, Not as a Token but a Legacy. Would they were such, as could have reach'd the sense, To know what use they had of excellence, Since destin'd to be yours; such as would be (Now yours) justly ambitious of a Tree To grow upon; scorne a dejected birth Course German Tiles, low Stalkes, that lace the Earth. Such as since gladly yours, got skill, and pow'r, To choose the strongest Sun, and weakest Showre: Such as in Groves Cecilian Lovers eat, To cool those wishes, that their Ladies heat. But if the Gard'ner make (like Adam) all Our humane hopes, bold, and apocryphal: And that my Mellons prove no better than Those lovely Pompeon's, which in Berbican, Fencers, and Vaulters Widows please to eat, Not as a Sallad, but cheap-filling Meat; Think then I'm dead indeed; and that they were Early bequeath'd, but pay'd too late i'th Year; So the just scornes, of your lov'd wit, no more Can hazard me, but my Executor. To the King on Newyeares day. 1630. ODE 1. 1 The joyes of eager Youth, of Wine, and Wealth, Of Faith untroubled, and unphysick'd Health; Of Lovers, when their Nuptial's nie, Of Saints forgiven when they die; Let this Year bring To Charles our King: To Charles, who is th' example, and the Law, By whom the good are taught, not kept in awe, 2 Long proffer'd Peace, and that not compass'd by Expensive Treaties but a Victorie; And Victories by Fame obtain'd, Or pray'r, and not by slaughter gain'd; Let this Year bring To Charles our King. To Charles; who is th' example, and the Law. By whom the good are taught, not kept in aw. 3 A Session too, of such who can obey, As they were gather'd to consult, not sway: Who now rebel, in hope to git Some office to reclaim their wit; Let this Year bring To Charles our King; To Charles; who is th' example and the Law, By whom the good are taught, not kept in awe. 4 Prætors, who will the publick cause defend, With timely gifts, not Speeches finely pend; To make the Northern Victors Fame No more our envy, nor our shame: Let this Year bring To Charles our King; To Charles; who is th' example, and the law, By whom the good are taught, not kept in aw. To the Queen, presented with a Suit, in the behalf of F. S. directed from Orpheus Prince of Poets. To the Queen of Light; In favor of a young listner to his Harp. I sing these numbers in the shady Land, Where Ayrie Princes dwell, which I command Some Spirit, or some Wind, gently convey To you, whose breath is Spring, whose Eie beames day 'Gainst your arrival here, which must be late: (Such pow'r the pray'rs of Mortals have with Fate) Fields I have dress'd, so rich in scent, and show; As if your influence taught our Flow'rs to grow Where still delighted you shall nobly move, Not like a sad Shadow, as they above With learned falshood most unkindly dreame Of ev'ry Ghost; but like a beautious Beame. The Lilly, and the Rose; which Lovers seek, Not on their stalkes, but on their Ladies Cheek; Shall here not dare take root, nor yet the strange And various Tulip; which so oft doth change Her am'rous Colours to a different hew, That yearly Men believe the Species new. Instead of these; on ev'ry Bank I'le show (Blith on his stemme) the nice Adonis grow; Who though, in's beauties warm'th belov'd of old; His transmutation only makes him cold; For the amazed Goddesse now perceives, Him scarce so fair in's Flesh, as is his Leaves. Then proud Narcissus, whose rare beauty had Far lesse excuse, and cause, to make him mad, When in his own eyes, flourishing alive; Than since he was become a Vegetive. With these, the jealous Crocus, and the chaste Anemone, whose blushes ever last. Now for a cooling Shade, what use have we Of the delightful Lydian-Platan-Tree, Which Xerxes so much lov'd? or of the Lime, Or the tall Pine, which spreads, as it doth climbe? Or Lovers Sicamore, or mine own Bay? On which, since my Euridices sad day, My Harpe hath silent hung? No Trees your Bowre Shall need; the slender stalke of ev'ry flow'r, When you arrive among us, and dispence The lib'ral comfort of your influence, Shall reach at Body, Rinde, and Boughs, then grow Till't yield a shade, as well as Scent, and Show. For your attendants here; Tomiris she That taught her sex, the ways to victorie; The Queen of Ithica, whose precious name For chast desires, is dear to us and Fame: And Artemisia whom truths best Record, Declar'd a living Tombe unto her Lord, Shall ever wait upon your sway, and when The Destinies are so much vex'd with Men, That the just God-like Monarch of your brest, Is ripe, and fit to take eternal rest; To court his spirit here, I will not call The testy Pyrrhus, or malicious Hannibal; Nor yet the fiery Youth of Macedon Shall have the dignity t'attend his Throne: But mighty Julias who had thoughts so high They humble seem'd, when th' aim'd at Victorie; And own'd a Soule so learn'd, Truth fear'd that she Too naked were, near his Philosophie: In anger valiant; gently calme in love: He soar'd an Eagle, but he stoop'd a Dove! Know Queen of Light, he only doth appeare, Fit to imbrace your Royal Lover here: Nor think my promise is the ayrie boast Of a dead Greek, a thinne-light-talking-Ghost: It shall be well perform'd; and all I dare For those just toyles commend unto your care: Is but a Poets humble suit; who now With everlasting Wreaths may deck his Brow: Since first your Poet call'd, and by that stile He is my Deputy throughout your Isle. To the Lord B. in performance of a vow, that night to write to him. My Lord, it hath been ask'd, why 'mongst those few I singled out for Fame, I chose not you With early speed the first? but I, that strive My manners should preserve my Verse alive: That read Men, and my self; would not permit The boldness of my love, should tax my wit. There are degrees, that to the Altar lead; Where ev'ry rude, dull Sinner must not tread: 'Tis not to bring, a swift thankes-giving Tongue, Or Prayers made as vehement as long, Can priviledge a zealous Votarie, To come, where the High Priest should only be: Then why should I (where some more skilful hand May offer Gummes, and Spice) strew Dust, and Sand? And this (my chief of Lords) made me designe Those noble flames, sprung from your nobler Wine, To keep my spirits warme, till I could prove My Numbers smooth, and mighty as my love: Yet such my treach'rous fate, that I this night (Fierce with untutor'd heat) did vow to write: But happy those, who undertake no more Than what their stock of rage hath rul'd before! It is a Poet's sin, that doth excel In love, or wine, not to resolve how well, But strait how much to write, for then we think The vast tumultuous Sea is but our Ink; The World, our Forrest too, and that we may Believe each Tree, that in it grows, a Bay. My vow now kept, I'm loth (my Lord) to do Wrong to your justice, and your mercy too; The last if you vouchsafe, you will excuse A strong Religion here, though not a Muse To Endimion Porter. How safe (Endimion) had I liv'd? how blest, In all the silent privacies of rest? How might I lengthen sleeps, had I been wise Unto my self, and never seen thine Eies? My Verse (unenvy'd then) had learn'd to move A slow, meek pace; like sober Hymns of love By some noch'd-Brownist sung, that would indear His holy itch, to some chaste Midwives Ear: The pleasure of ambition then had bin, To me lost in the danger, and the sinn: The Mirtle Sprig (that never can decay) I had not known, nor Wreaths of living Bay: Instead of these, and the wild Ivy Twine, (Which our wise Fathers justly did assigne, To him that in immortal Verse exceeds) My brow had worn, some homely Wreath of Weeds: And such low pride is safe: for though the Bay, Lightning, nor Winds can blast, yet Envy may. If hidden still from thee, I should have lesse To answer now, for glory, and excesse: My surfeits had not reach'd the cunning yet, To seek an expiation from their wit: For more then Village Ale, and drowsie Beer, (Cawdles, and Broth to the dull Islander) I n'ere had wish'd; now, My Man, hot, and dry, With fierce transcriptions of my Poesie: Cryes, Sir, I thirst! then strait I bid him chuse (As Poets Prentices did surely use Of Greece and Rome) some clear, cheap Brook, there stay, And drink at Natures charge his thirst away: Though Fasts (More then are taught i'th' Kalender) Had made him weak; this gave him strength to swear, And urge that after Horace the divine Mæcenas knew, his slaves drunk ever Wine: So whilst Endimion lives, he vows to pierce Old Gascoine Cask, or not transcribe a verse. If never known to thee, missing the skill How to do good, I should have found my ill Excus'd; th' excessive charge of Ink, an Oyle, Expence of quiet sleeps, and the vain toyle, In which the Priest of Smirna took delight, (When he for knowledge chang'd his precious sight) Had scap'd me then, now whilst I strive to please With tedious Art, I loose the lust of ease. And when our Poets (enviously mis-led) Shall find themselves out-written, and out-read; 'Twill urge their sorrow too, that thou didst give To my weak numbers, strength, and joy to live. But O! uneasie thoughts! what will become Of me, when thou retir'st into a Tombe? The cruel, and the envious then will say: Since now his Lord is dead; he that did sway Our publick smiles, opinion, and our praise, Till we this childe of Poesie did raise To Fame, and love; let's drown him in our Inke; Where like a lost dull Plummet let him sinke From humane sight; from knowledge he was borne Unless succession find him in our scorne. Remembrance, never to repentance showes, The wealth we gaine, But what we fear to lose; Thou art my wealth; and more than Light ere spy'd, Than Eastern Hills bring forth, or Seas can hide: But this when I rejoyce, my fears divine, I want the fate, still to preserve thee mine: And Kings depos'd, wish they had never known Delight, nor sway; which ere they toyl'd to owne. Jeffereidos, on the Captivity of Jeffery. Canto the First. A sayle! a sayle! cry'd they, who did consent Once more to break the eighth Commandement For a few Coles, of which by theft so well Th'are stor'd; they have enow to furnish Hell With penal heat, though each sad Devil there A frozen Muscovite, or Russian were; The chace grew swift, whilst an old weary Pinke, Not us'd to fly, and somewhat loth to sinke, Did yield unto the Foe, who boards her strait: And having rifled all her precious Freight; A trembling Britaine kneels, and did beseech Each composition there, of Tar and Pitch, That they would hear him speak: 'tis not (quoth he) Our kind respect to wealth, or libertie, Begets this fear, but least blind fortune may Unto some fierce, unruly hand betray, The truest Servant to a state, that cou'd Be giv'n a Nation out of flesh and blood: And he tall Jeffery hight! who not much us'd To fights at Sea, and loth to be abus'd, Resolv'd to hide him, where they sooner might Discover him, with smelling than with sight. Each Eye was now imploy'd, no man could think Of any uncouth Nooke, or narrow Chinke, But strait they sought him there; in holes not deep But small, where slender Magot's us'd to creep: At last, they found him close, beneath a spick And almost span-new-peuter-Candlestick. A crafty Diego, that had now command Of Ships and Victorie, took him in hand: Peis'd him twice, tasted his discourse, at length Believ'd, that he dissembled wit, and strength: Quoth he, Victors, and Vanquished! I bid You all give ear, to wisdom of Madrid! This that appears to you, a walking Thumbe, May prove, the gen'ral Spie of Christendome: Then calls for Chaines, but such as fitting seeme For Elephants, when manag'd in a Teeme. Whilst puissant Jefferey 'gins to wish (in vaine) He had long since contriv'd a truce with Spaine His Sinews faile him now: nor doth he yield Much trust unto his Buckler, or his Shield; Yet threatens like a second Tamberlaine, To bring them 'fore the Queens Lord-Chamberlaine; Because without the leave, of him, or her, They keep her Houshold-Servant prisoner. Diego, that study'd wrath, more than remorse, Commands, that they to Dunkirke steer their course: Whilst Captive-Jeffrey shews to wiser sight, Just like a melancholy Isralite, In midst of's journey unto Babylon; Melt marble hearts, that chance to think thereon! The winds are guilty too; for now behold! Already landed this our Brittaine bold! The people view him round; some take their oath He's humaine Issue, but not yet of growth: And others (that more sub'tly did confer) Think him a small, contracted Conjurer: Then Diego, Bredro, names! Hemskerke! and cryes, Hansvan Geulick! Derick too! place your Thighs On this judicial Bench, that we may sit T' undoe, this short Embassadour with wit. One faine would know's descent: Thou Pirat-Dogge (The wrathful Captive then reply'd) not Ogge (The Bashan King) was my Progenitor; Nor did I strive, to fetch my Ancestor From Aneck's Sonnes, nor from the Genitals Of wrastling-Cacus, who gave many falls. No matter for his birth, said Diego then; Bring hither strait the Rack! for it is Ten To one, this will inforce from out his Pate, Some secrets, that concern the English State, But O! true, loyal Heart! he'd not one word Reveale, that he had heard at Councel-bord. Some ask'd him then, his bus'ness late in France; What Instruments lay there conceal'd t'advance The British cause? when they perceiv'd his heart; Was big and whilst enforc'd, would nought impart Diego arose, and said, Sir, I beseech you, Acquaint us if the Cardinal de Richelieu Intends a war in Italy, or no? (Most noble Jeffery still!) he seems to know Nought of that point; though divers think, when there, The Cardinal did whisper in his eare The Scheame of all his plots; and sought to gaine His company along with him to Spaine; For thither he'll march, if he can by th' way Sweep a few durty Nations into th' Sea. A solemn Monke, that silent stood close by, Believ'd this little Captive, a Church-Spie! Quoth he, that shrivled face, hath Schysme in it; And lately ther's a learned volumne writ, Wherein Ben-Jharky and Ben-Ezra too, And Rabin Kimky eke, a learned Jew, Are cited all, it labours to make good, That there were Protestants before the Flood; And thou its Author art; Jeffery swore then, He never knew those Hebrew Gentlemen! When they perceiv'd, nor threats, nor kindness sought From love, could get him to discover ought; Diego leaves the Table, sweares by his Skarffe; The thing they doubted thus, was a meer Dwarffe. The fleetest Izeland-Shock, they then provide: On-which they mount him strait, and bid him ride: He weeps a teare or two, for's Jewells lost; And does with heavy heart, to Bruxels post. Canto the Second. So runs the nible Snaile, in slimy track, Hast'ning with all his Tenement on's back, And so, on goodly Cabidge leafe, the fleet, Swift-Caterpiller moves with eager feet, As this sad Courtier now; whose mighty Steed May for an easie amble, or for speed, Compare with gentle Bull in Yoke: But O! Here now begins a Canticle of woe! Chide cruel Fate, whose business in the Spheares, Wise Jeffery notes, is but to cause our Teares: Their rule, and pow'r (quoth he) is understood, More in the harm they do us, than the good: And this he said, because he scarce had driven Along that Coast, the length of Inches seven, But down his Izeland fell; some Authors say A burley Oake, lay there disguis'd in's way; Others a Rush; and from report, his steed Did stumble, at the splinter of a Reed; And some (far more authentick) say agin, 'Twas at a haire, that drop'd some humane chin? But though, the Sage Historians are at strife, How to resolve this point, his Coursers life They hold lost in the fall, whilst the discreet Jeffery was forc'd, to wander on his Feet. Old wives, that saw the sorrows of this Spy, Their wither'd Lips (thinner then lids of Eye) Strait opened wide; and tickled with his wrongs; Did laugh, as if t'were lech'ry to their Lungs: And Diego too, whose grave, and solemn Brow, Was ever knit, grew loud, and wanton now: O for a Guard (quoth he) of Switzers here, To heave that Giant up! but come not near: For now enrag'd, he may perchance so tosse us, As you would think, you toucht alive Colossus! This Jeffery heard; and it did stir his Gall, More than his Coursers death, or his own fall. Sorrowes that hasten to us, are but slow, In their departure, as the learn'd may know By this sad story, since new cause was given; For which our deep Platonick questions Heaven. O cruel Starres! (quoth he) will you still so Officious be, to trouble us below? 'Tis said your care doth govern us, d'ye call That care, to let Ambassadors thus fall? Nay, and permit worse dangers to ensue? Though all your rule, and influence be true; I had as leefe (since mortals thus you handle) Be govern'd by the influence of a Candle. This he had cause to say; for now behold A Foule of spatious wings bloody, and bold In his aspect; haughty in gate, and stiffe on His large spread Claves he stood, as any Griffon: Though by a kind, a Turkey; whose plot that way Was like a subtile Scowt to watch for prey; Such as is blown about by ev'ry wind: But here's the dire mistake; this Foule (half blinde) At Jefferey pecks, and with intent to eat Him up, instead of a large graine of Wheat: Jefferey in mighty rage ne're thinks upon't, As th' Turkeys hunger, but as an affront. His sword he drew; a better none alive E're got from Spanish Foe, for Shillings Five, And now the Battaile doth begin: sound high Your Oaten Reeds, t' encourage Victorie! Strike up the wrathful Tabor! and the Githern; The loud Jew's-trump! and Spirit-stirring-Cittherne! Jeffery the bold, as if he had o'reheard These Instruments of War, his Arme uprear'd, Then cryes S?. George for England! and with that word He mischief'd (what I pray?) nought but his sword: Though some report, he noch'd the Foes left wing; And Poets too who faithfully did sing This Battaile in Low-Dutch, till of a few Small Feathers there, which at the first charge flew About the field; but do not strictly know That they were shed by fury of that blow. This they affirme; the Turkey in his look Express'd how much, he it unkindly took That wanting food; our Jeffery would not let him, Enjoy a while the priviledge to eat him: His Tayle he spreads, jets back; then turns agen; And fought, as if, for th'honour of his Hen: Jeffery retorts each stroke; and then cryes, Mauger Thy strength, I will dissect thee like an Augure! But who of mortal race deserves to write The next encounter in this bloody fight? Wisely didst thou (O Poet of Anchusin;) Stay here thy Pen, and leur thy eager Muse in; Envoking Mars, some half an houre at least, To help thy fury onward with the rest: For Jefferey strait was throwne; whilst faint and weak, The cruel Foe, assaults him with his Beak, A Lady-Midwife now, he there by chance Espy'd, that came along with him from France: A heart nours'd up in War; that n're before This time (quoth he) could bow, now doth implore: Thou that delivered'st hast so many, be So kinde of nature, to deliver me! But stay: for though the learn'd Chronologer Of Dunkerk, doth confess him freed by her; The subt'ler Poets yet, whom we translate In all this Epick Ode, do not relate The manner how; and we are loth at all To vary from the Dutch Original. Deeds they report, of greater height than these; Wonders and truth; which if the Court-wits please, A little help from Nature, lesse from Art, May happily produce in a Third part. For the Lady Olivia Porter; A Present upon a New-years day. Goe! hunt the whiter Ermine! and present His wealthy skin, as this dayes Tribute sent To my Endimion's Love; Though she be fare More gently smooth, more soft than Ermines are! Goe! climbe that Rock! and when thou there hast found A Star, contracted in a Diamond, Give it Endimion's Love, whose glorious Eyes, Darken the starry Jewels of the Skies! Goe! dive into the Southern Sea! and when Th'ast found (to trouble the nice sight of Men) A swelling Pearle; and such whose single worth, Boast all the wonders which the Seas bring forth; Give it Endimion's Love! whose ev'ry Teare, Would more enrich the skilful Jeweller. How I command? how slowly they obey? The churlish Tartar, will not hunt to day: Nor will that lazy, sallow-Indian strive To climbe the Rock, nor that dull Negro dive. Thus Poets like to Kings (by trust deceiv'd) Give oftner what is heard of, than receiv'd. To I. C. Robb'd by his Man Andrew. Sir, whom I now love more, then did the good Saint Martin, that all-naked-Flesh-and bloud, Whose Cloake (at Plimouth spun) was Crab-tree wood. His own was Tammy sure; which made it teare So soon into a gift; and thou (I feare) Wilt beg half mine, not to bestow, but wear: For thy Saint-Andrew sought not out the way To keep thee warme, but make thee watch, and pray; That is, for his returne; about Doomes-day; Worse left, than blushing Adam, who withdrew, The nakedness he fear'd, more than he knew; Not to a Mercers, but where Fig-leaves grew: Which sew'd with strings of slender weeds, cloath men Cheaper than Silks, that must be paid for, when It pleases the chief Scribe 'oth' Chamberlen. Though my sick Joynts, cannot accompany Thy Hue-on-cry; though Midnight parlies be Silenc'd long since, 'tween Constables, and me, Without their helps; or Suburb-Justices, (Upon whose justice now an Impost lies, For with the price of Beef, their Warrants rise) I'le find this Andrew strait. See, where the pale Wretch stands: thy guiltless Robes (ne're hang'd for sale;) He executes, on sundry Broakers Nayle. Instead of him (chas'd thence by his wise feare) Does the Mothers joy, a bold Youth appear; Who swaggers up to Forty Markes a year! Sometimes he troubles Law, at th'Inns of Court; Now comes to buy him Weeds of shining sort; And faine would have thy Cloak, but 'tis too short: Too short (neat Sir) was all thy rifled store; Which made those Brokers curse thy Stature more, Than thou, Friend-Andrew, the sad day before. But hark! who knocks; good truth my Muse is staid, By an Apothecaries Bill unpaid; Whose length, not strange-nam'd Drugs, makes her afraid. To the Earl of Portland, Lord Treasurer; on the Marriage of his Son. My Lord, this night is yours! each wandring Star That was unbusi'd, and irregular; Most gravely now, his bright Companion leads, To fix o're your glad roofe, their shining Heads; And it is said, th' exemplar King's your guest; And that the rich Ey'd Darling of his Breast, (To ripen all our joys) will there become The Musick, Odor, Light of ev'ry Roome! A mixture of two Noble bloods, in all Faith, and domestick nature, union call, No travail'd Eyes have seen, with humbler state Of love perform'd, where Princes celebrate, This when I heard; I know not what bold Starre My Spirits urg'd, but it was easier farre The torn, the injur'd Panther, to restraine In's hot pursuit, or stroke him coole againe; To tell the cause, why Winds do disagree, Divide them when in stormes they mingled be; Strait fix them single, where they breath'd before; Or fanne them with a plume, from Sea to Shore; Than bind my raging Temples, or resist The pow'r that swell'd me, as Apollo's Priest. Therefore my Robe, that on his Altar lay, My Virge, my Wreath, I took; and thus did pray: That you (my Lord) with lasting memory, And strength of fervent youth, may live to see, Your name in this blest nuptial store the Earth, With such a masculine, and knowing birth; As shall at factious Councels moderate, And force injurious Armies to their fate. Let time be fetter'd, that they never may Increasing others, feel themselves decay. To you (my Lord) who with wise industrie, Seek Vertue out, then give it strength to be; Where ere you shall recide let plenty bring The pride, and expectations of the Spring; The wealth that loads inticing Autumne grow Within your reach; let hasty Rivers flow Till on your shores, they skaly Tribute pay, Then ebbe themselves in empty waves away; Let each pale Flow'r, that springeth there, have pow'r T' invite a Sun-beame, and command a Show'r; The dew that falls about you taste of Wine, Each abject Weed change root and be a Vine! But I with this prophetick plenty grow Already rich, and proud; cause then I know The Poets of this Isle, in Vineyards may Rejoyce, whilst others thirst in groves of Bay! Sir, let me not your weary patience move; And sinne, with two much courage of my love! He that in strength of wishes, next shall trie, T' increase your blessings with his Poetry May shew a fiercer Wit, and cleaner Art; But not a more sincere, and eager Heart. The Queen returning to London, after a long absence. How had you walk'd in Mists of Sea-coale-smoake Such as your ever teeming Wives would choake, (False Sons of thrift!) did not her beauties light, Dispel your Clouds, and quicken your dull sight? As when, th'illustrious Officer of Day, (First worshipp'd in the East) 'gins to display The glory of his beames; then Buds unfold Their chary Leafes; each dew-drown'd Marigold Insensibly doth stirre it self, and spread; Each Violet lifts up the pensive Head; So when the Rayes of her fair head appear, To warm, and guild your clouded Hemispheare, Those Flow'rs which in your narrow Gardens grow, (Narrow as Turfs, which you a lark allow In's wicker Cage) rejoyce upon their stalks; Imbellishing your sommer-inch-broad-walks. But she remov'd, what all your weary'd lives, You plant in German pots, to please your Wives, Shall fade; scarce in your Climate shall be seen Enough of Spring to make your Tansies green. Nor shall your blew-Ey'd Daughters more appear (Though in the hopefull'st season of the Year) In the dark street, where Tantlin's Temple stands, With Time, and Marg'rom Posies in their hands. We know (distrustful Bargainers!) you most Love sacrifice, that puts you least to cost; Give her your prayers then; that her looks may After long Nights, restore you unto Day. Though Ringing be some charge, and Wood grow dear, In troth, it will become you once a year, To offer Bells and Bonfires too, although You couzen't out in Silks, next publick Show. To I. W. upon the death of his Mistress. As the great Sons of War, that are rais'd high With long Success and frequent Victory, Grow to such lazy pride; they take it ill Men still should put them to the paines to kill; And would, at each sterne becken of the Eye, Have the sad Foe, vaile Plumes take leave, and dye: So thou; as if thy Sorrows had o'recome Halfe the wise world, and struck all reason dumbe; Cry'st, she is dead! and frown'st, because I now Take not my Wreath, (the Treasure of my Brow) Then hurle my self, and it, a Sacrifice In hallow'd flames, to her departed Eyes. Cause early Men, their Curtaines draw, and say Behold the Sun is risen, now 'tis day; Knowing thy Sun is set, thou swar'st their sight, Is led by bus'ness t'a mistake of Light, Lovers believe, if yet th' Almighty cou'd, Doubt part of his so swift creation good; To ease him of another Fiat, they Can with their Mistress beames, make him a day: To rule the Night, each Glance (they think) will fit Planets to largest Spheares, if we admit Their silly Priests (the Poets) be but by, That love to sooth such faith t'idolatry. But how have I transgress'd, thus to declame 'Gainst sorrow I should envy more then blame? For what is he, though reverendly old, And than a Mountaine Muscovite more cold; Though he wants Wit, or Nature to desire; Though his hard heart be Ir'n, his heart strings Wire: Or what is he, though blind, and knows no good Of love, but by an itching faith in's blood. That when thy Tongue her beauty open layes To mental view, and her soft minde displayes, Will think thy grief was over-pay'd, or yet Bate the world one Sigh, of so just a debt? But she is gone! Repine now, if you dare; Like Heav'ns unlicenc'd Fools, all punish'd are For Nature as for crimes; yet cannot choose But mourn for ev'ry excellence we loose; Though still commanded to a tame content; To think no good was given us, but lent: And a fond riddle in Philosophy, Perswades us too; the virtuous never dye; That all the ills, which we in absence find Concern the Eye-sight onely, not the Mind: But Lovers (whose wise Sences take delight In warm contaction, and in real sight) Are not with lean imagination fed, Or satisfi'd, with thinking on the Dead. 'Tis fit we seek her then; but he that finds Her out, must enter friendship with the Winds; Enquire their dwelling, and uncertain walks; Whither they blow, from their forsaken Stalks Flowers that are gone, ere they are smelt? or how Dispose o'th sweeter Blossoms of the Bough? For she (the Treasuress of these) is fled, Not having the dull leasure to be dead; But t'hoord this Wealth; return, and this wealth bring Still vary'd, and increas'd in ev'ry Spring. To Endimion Porter. It is (Lord of my Muse and Heart) since last Thy sight inspir'd me, many ages past. In darkness thick as ill-met Clouds can make, In sleeps wherein the last Trump scarce could wake The guilty dead, I lay and hidden more Than Truth, which testy Disputants explore. More hid than paths of Snakes, to their deep beds, Or walkes of Mountaine-Springs from their first Heads: And when my long forgotten Eies, and Mind, Awak'd; I thought to see the Sun declin'd Trough age, to'th' influence of a Star, and Men So small, that they might live in Wombes agen, But now, my strength's so giantly, that were The great Hill-lifters once more toyling here; Theyl'd choose me out, for active Back, for Bone, To heave at Pælion first, and heave alone. Now by the softness of thy noble care, Reason and Light, my lov'd Companions are; I may too, ere this Moon be lost, refine My bloud, and bathe my Temples with thy wine And then, know my Endimion (thou whose name To'th World example is, Musick to Fame) I'le trie if Art, and Nature, able be From the whole strength, and stock of Poesie, To pay thee my large debts, such as the poor In open Blushes, hidden Hearts restore. Epitaph on I. Walker. Envy'd and lov'd, here lies the Prince of mirth! Who laugh'd at the grave bus'ness of the Earth, Look'd on ambitious States-men with such eyes, As might discern them guilty, could not wise. That did the noyse of War, and Battailes hear, As mov'd to smiling pitty, not to fear: Thought fighting Princes at their dying sad; Believ'd, both Victors, and the Conquer'd mad: Might have been rich, as oft as he would please, But ways to wealth, are not the ways to ease. The wit and courage of his talk, now rests, In their impatient keeping that steale-Jeasts; His Jeasts, who e're shall Father, and repeat Shall mem'ry needs, but let's estate be great, Danger so season'd them, each hath Salt left, Will yet undo the poor for one small theft; The rich, that will own them, what e're they pay, Shall find, 'tis twice a week Star-Chamberday. To Doctor Cademan, Physitian to the Queen. For thy Victorious cares, thy ready heart; Thy so small tyranny to so much Art; For visits made to my disease And me, (alas) not to my Fees: For words so often comforting with scope Of learned reason not perswasive hope: For Med'cines so benigne, as seeme Cordials for Eastern Queens that teeme. For setting now my condemn'd body free, From that no God, but Devil Mercurie: For an assurance I ne'r shall A forfeit be to' th'Admiral Like those in Hospitals, who dare presume To make French Cordage now of English Rhume; Or slender Ropes, on which instead Of Pearle, Revolted Teeth they thred; For limiting my Cheekes, that else had been Swoln like the signe, o'th Head 'oth Saracen; For preservation from a long Concealment of my Mother-Tongue; Whilst speechless, sow'd in Hoods I should appear, An Antarminian, silenc'd Minister; Or some Turks poyson'd Mute so fret So some at mouth, make signs and spet. Whilst all I eat, goes down with lookes to sight More forc'd, than Quailes t'each full-cramm'd Isralite Whose angry swollowing denotes They lay at Flux, and had sore throats. For these deliverances, and all the good My new return of Sences, strength, and blood, Shall bring, for all I mine can boast, Whilst my Endimion is not lost, By th' feeble influence of my Starre; or turns From me, to one whose Planet cleerer burnes, May (thou safe Lord of Arts) each spring Ripe plenty of Diseases bring Unto the rich; they still t'our Surgeons be Experiments, Patients alone to thee: Health to the Poor; least pitty shou'd (That gently stirs, and rules thy blood) Tempt thee from wealth, to such as pay like me A Verse; then think, they give Eternity. To Endimion Porter, when my Comedy (call'd the Wits) was presented at Black-Fryers. Hear, how for want of others grief, I mourn My sad decay, and weep, at mine own Urne! The Hour's (that ne're want Wings, when they should fly To hasten Death, or lead on Destinie,) Have now fulfill'd the time, when I must come Chain'd to the Muses Barre, to take my doom: When ev'ry Term, some tim'rous Poet stands, Condemn'd by whispers, e're repriev'd by hands. I that am told conspiracies are laid, To have my Muse, her Arts, and life betray'd, Hope for no easie Judge; though thou wert there, T'appease, and make their judgments less severe. In this black day, like men from Thunders rage, Or drowning showres, I hasten from the stage; And with my self, some Spirit, had within Those distant wandring Winds, that yet have bin Unknown to th' Compass, or the Pilots skill; Or some loose Plummit sunk so low, until I touch where roots of Rocks deep bury'd be; There mourn beneath the leafeless Coral Tree. But I am grown too tame! what need I fear, Whilst not to passion, but thy reason clear? Should I perceive, thy knowledge were subdu'd, T' unkind consent with the harsh Multitude, Then I had cause to weep; and at thy Gate (Deny'd to enter) stand disconsolate, Amaz'd and lost to mine own Eyes; there I (Scarce griev'd for by my self) would winke and die, Olivia then, may on thy pitty call To bury me, and give me funeral. In celebration of the yearly Preserver of the Games Costwald. Hear me you Men of strife! you that have bin, Long time maintain'd by the dull Peoples sin. At Lyon's, Furnifold's, and Clement's Inne! With huge, o're-comming Mutton, Target-Cheese, Beefe, that the queasie stomack'd Guard would please, And limber Groats, full half a Score for Fees. Hear you Grown'd Lackeys that on both sides plead; Whose hollow Teeth, are stuff'd with others Bread; Whose Tongues will live (sure) when your selves are dead. Hear you Alcaldos, whose sterne faces look, Worse than our Pris'ner's that's deny'd his Book; Than Pilat painted like Sir Edward Cook. List all that toyle for pow'r to do Men wrong, With pensive Eare, to my prophetick Song! Whose Magick sayes, your Triumphs hold not long. The time is come, you on your selves shall sit; Whilst Children finde (if they endeavour it) Your learning, Chronicle; Clinches your Wit. Ere you a Year are dead, your Sones shall watch, And roare all night with Ale in house of Thatch; And speed, 'till Swords are worn in Belts of Match. Whilst Dover (that his knowledge not imploy's T' increase his Neighbours Quarrels, but their Joyes) Shall in his age; get Money, Girles, and Boyes! Money at Cotswald Games shall early fly; Whilst the Precise, and envious shall stand by, And see his Min'ral Fountain never dry. His Girles, shall dowr-less wed with Heirs of birth; His Boyes, plough London Widows up like earth; Whilst Potswald Bards Cartol their Nuptial Mirth! Dover (the Gentr'ys Darling) know this flame, Is but a willing tribute to thy Fame, Sung by a Poet, that conceals his name. On the Death of the Lady Marquess of Winchester. In care, lest some advent'rous Lover may (T'increase his love) cast his own Stock away; I (that finde, th' use of grief is to grow wise) Forbid all traffique now, 'twixt Hearts and Eyes: Our remnant-love, let us discreetly save, Since not augment; for Love lies in the Grave. Lest Men; whose patience is their senses sloth, That onely live, t' expect the tedious growth Of what the following Summer slowly yields; Whose fair Elizium, is their furrow'd Fields, Lest these, should so much prize mortalitie; They ne're would reach the wit, or faith to die; Know Summer comes no more; to the dark bed Our Sun is gone; the hopeful Spring is dead. And least kind Poets that delight to raise (With their just truths, not extasie of praise) Beauty to Fame; should rashly overthrow The credit of their Songs; I let them know Their Theame is lost, so lost, that I have griev'd, They never more can praise, and be believ'd. To Endimion Porter, upon his recovery from a long Sickness. Just so the Sun doth rise, as if last Night He cal'd to' accompt the Moon, for all the light She ever ow'd; now looks so full of scorne, And pride; as she had paid him all this Morne I So clear a day, timely foretels; I now Shall scape those Clouds, that hung upon my Brow, Whilst I thy sickness mourn'd; and less did sleep, Than faithful Widowes, that sincerely weep. A true presage! My hopes no sooner tell What they desir'd, but strait I find thee well. Bless'd be the Stars; whose pow'rful influence Our healths, by Minerals, and Herbs dispence! And that's their chiefest use: who thinks that Fate So many Stars did purposely create. And them so large, meerly for show, and light; Concludes, it took less care of day then Night. Since thou art safe, those Numbers will be lost, Which I laid up, to mourn thee as a Ghost: Unless I spend them on some Tragick Tale, Which Lovers shall believe, and then bewaile: Next Term, prepare thee for the Theater! And until then, reserve thy skilful Eare; For I will sing imagin'd Tragedy, 'Till Fates repent their essence is so high From passion ravs'd, 'cause they can ne're obtaine To taste the griefs, which gentle Poets feigne. Upon the Nuptials of Charles Lord Herbert, and the Lady M. Villers Roses 'till ripe, and ready to be blown, Their beauty hide, whilst it is yet their owne; 'Tis ours but in expectance, whilst th' are green; And bashfully they blush when first 'tis seen, As if to spread their beauty were a crime; A fault in them, not in all-ripening-Time. So stands (hidden with Vayles) in all her pride Of early flourishing, the bashful Bride! And 'till the Priest, with words devoutly said, Shall ripen her a Wife, that's yet a Maid, Her Vaile will never off: so modest still, And so express'd by Nature, not by skill, That sure she dress'd her looks when she did rise, Not in her Glass, but in her Mother's Eyes. The jolly Bridegroom stands, as he had t'ane And led Love strongly fetter'd in a Chaine: Forgetting when her Vailes are laid aside, Himself is but a Captive to the Bride. The Priest now joynes their hands, and he doth find By misterie divine, in both one mind, Mix'd, and dispers'd; his spirits strait begin (As they were rap't) to vex, and talk within: His Temples sweat, whilst he stood silent by, Not as prepar'd to bless, but prophesie: What needed more? since they must needs possess, All he fore-told, though he should never bless: And blessing unto such as most restores, Or but repeats what was their Ancestors. Prologue to a reviv'd Play of Mr. Fletchers, call'd, The Woman-hater. Ladies take't as a secret in your Eare, In stead of homage, and kind welcome here, I heartily could wish, you all were gone; For if you stay, good faith, we are undone. Alass! you now expect, the usuall wayes Of our address, which is your Sexes praise: But we to night, unluckily must speake, Such things will make your Lovers Heart-strings breake, Bely your Virtues, and your beauties staine, With words, contriv'd long since, in your disdaine. 'Tis strange you stirr not yet; not all this while Lift up your Fannes to hide a scornfull smile: Whisper, or jog your Lords to steale away; So leave us t'act, unto our selves, our Play: Then sure, there may be hope, you can subdue, Your patience to endure, an Act, or two: Nay more, when you are told our Poets rage Pursues but one example, which that age VVherein he liv'd produc'd; and we rely Not on the truth, but the variety. His Muse believ'd not, what she then did write; Her VVings, were wont to make a nobler flight; Soar'd high, and to the Stars, your Sex did raise; For which, full Twenty years, he wore the Bayes. 'Twas he reduc'd Evadne from her scorne, And taught the sad Aspacia how to mourne; Gave Arethusa's love, a glad reliefe; And made Panthea elegant in griefe. If these great Trophies of his noble Muse, Cannot one humor 'gainst your Sex excuse VVhich we present to night; you'l finde a way How to make good the Libell in our Play: So you are cruell to your selves; whilst he (Safe in the fame of his integritie) VVill be a Prophet, not a Poet thought; And this fine VVeb last long, though loosely wrought. To Endimion Porter, passing to Court to him by Water. ODE 1. 1 The truth and wisdome of your Compass boast (Dull Men of th' Sea!) when you the flow'rie Coast Have reach'd, to which you steere; Think then, those Clouds are shrunk again, That svvell'd, as if they hoorded Rain For all the Yeare Think then, those ruder Winds are dumbe, That would endeavour Storms to come; And that the Rocks no more (As they were wont) shall hide themselves, To practise mischief on the Shelves So near the Shore. 2 Into the Silver Flood I lanch'd, and fraught My bark with Hope the Parasite of thought: To Court my voyage tends; But hope, grew sick, and made me feare, The Bark would split, that harbour'd there To trade for Friends. Wise Love, that sought a noble choice To tune my Harp, and raise my Voice, Forbids my Pinnace rest, Till I had cur'd weak Hope again, By safely Anchoring within Endimion's Brest. 3 Endimion! who, with Numbers sweet can move Soules (though untun'd) to such degrees of love; That men should sooner see, Th'inticed Needle disobey The tempting Adamant, than they His Poesie: And I (exalted now) ne're minde Their breath, who storm'd t'increase the Winde By which th'are overthrowne; Their Stock of rage, and Lyrick Skill, They boast in vain; the Poets Hill Is all mine own. Elegie on B. Haselrick, slain in's youth, in a Duell. Now in the blind and quiet time of Night, So dark as if the funerall of Light Were celebrated here; whither with slow, Unwilling feet, sad Virgins do you goe? Where have you left your reason, and your fear? What meane those Violets that down-ward wear Their heads, as griev'd, since thus imploy'd they grew? Lilies, search'd by your looks, to their pale hew! Roses, that lost their blushes on the Bough, And Laurell stoln from some dead Poets Brow? These, and your looser Hair; shew that you come To scatter both, on that relenting Tombe. But stay! by this moist pavement it appears, Some Ladies have been earli'r here with Tears Than I, or you; and we can guess no more, Those that succeed, by these that drop'd before; Than by the Dew, faln in a Cowslips wombe, Heav'n's Treasurie of Showrs that are to come. The Curtain's drawne! look there and you shall spie The faded God of your Idolatrie! Cold as the feet of Rocks, silent in shade As Chaos lay, before the Winds were made. Yet this was once the Flow'r, on whom the Day So smil'd, as if he never should decay: Soft, as the hands of Love, smooth as her brow; So young in shew, as if he still should grow; Yet perfected with all the pride of strength, Equall in Limbs, and square unto his length: And though the jealous World hath understood, Fates only Seal'd the first Creation good; This moderne worke (sterne Fates!) rose up to prove Your ancient skill retain'd, but not your love: Could you have lov'd, you had with careful sight Preserv'd, what you did frame with such delight. O, let me summe his crimes, let me relate Them strictly as his Judge, not Advocate; And yet the greatest number you shall find Were errors of his youth, not of his mind: For had his jealous courage been so wise, As to believe it selfe, not others Eyes; Had he not thought his little patience tame In suff'ring quiet Men, t'enjoy a Fame; He might have liv'd to so great use, that I Had writ his Acts, and not his Elegie. Goe, gentlest of your Sex! should I relate With bolder truth, th'unkindness of his Fate, (Too strict, to flesh and blood) I might infuse A Schisme in your Religion, and my Muse: Yet this would be excus'd, since all we gain By griefe, is but the licence to complain. To the QUEEN upon a New-years day. You of the Guard make way! and you that keep The Presence warme, and quiet whilst you sleep Permit me pass! and then (if any where Imploy'd) you Angels that are busi'st here, And are the strongest Guard, although unseene, Conduct me neere the Chamber of the Queen! Where with such reverence as Hermits use At richest Shrines, I may present my Muse: Awake! salute, and satisfie thy sight, Not with the fainting Sun's, but thine own Light! Let this day break from thine own Silken spheare, This Day, the birth, and Infant of the yeare! Nor is there need of Purple, or of Lawne To vest thee in, were but thy Curtaines drawne, Men might securely say, that it is morne, Thy Garments serve to hide, not to adorne! Now she appeares, whilst ev'ry look, and smile, Dispences warmth, and beauty through our Isle: Whilst from their wealthiest Caskets, Princes pay Her gifts, as the glad tribute of this Day! This Day; which Time shall owe to her, not Fate; Because her early Eyes did it create. But O! poore Poets! Where are you? Why bring You not your Goddess now an Offering? Who makes your Numbers Swift, when they mov'd slow, And when they ebb'd, her influence made them flow, Alass! I know your wealth: the Laurell bough, Wreath'd into Circles, to adorne the Brow, Is all you have: But goe; these strew, and spread, In Sacrifice, where ever she shall tread, And ere this day grow old, know you shall see Each Leafe become a Sprig, each Sprig a Tree. Elegie, On Francis Earle of Rutland. Call not the Winds! nor bid the Rivers stay! For though the sighs, the teares they could repay Which injur'd Lovers, Mourners for the Dead, Captives, and Saints; have breath'd away, and shed; Yet we should want to make our sorrow fit For such a cause, as now doth silence it. Rutland! the noble, and the just! whose name Already is, all History, all Fame! Whom like brave Ancestors in Battaile lost, We mention not in pitty, but in boast! How didst thou smile, to see the solemne sport, Which vexes busie greatness in the Court? T'observe their Lawes of faction, place and Time, Their precepts how, and where, and when to climbe? Their rules, to know if the sage meaning lies, In the deep Breast, i'th' shallow Brow, or Eyes? Though Titles, and thy blood, made thee appeare, (Oft 'gainst thy ease) where these state-Rabbins were, Yet their Philosophy thou knew'st was fit, For thee to pitty, more then study it. Safely thou valu'dst Cunning, as 'thad been, Wisdome, long since, distemper'd into Sin: And knew'st, the actions of th'Ambitious are But as the false Alarmes in running warre, Like forlorne Scouts (that raise the coyle) they keep Themselves awake, to hinder others sleep: And all they gaine, by vex'd expence of breath. Unquietness, and guilt; is at their death, Wonder, and mighty noise; whilst things that be Most deare and pretious to Mortalitie (Time, and thy Self) impatient here of stay, With a grave silence, seeme to steal away; Depart from us unheard, and we still mourne In vaine (though piously) for their returne. Thy Bounties if I name; I'le not admit, Kings when they love, or wooe, to equall it: It shew'd like Natur's self, when she doth bring All she can promise by an early Spring; Or when she payes that promise where she best Makes Summers for Mankind; in the rich East. And, as the wise Sun, silently imployes His lib'rall Beames, and ripens without Noise; As precious Dewes, doe undiscover'd fall, And growth insensibly doth steale on all; So what he gave, conceal'd in private came, (As in the dark) from one that had no name; Like Fayries wealth, not given to restore, Or if reveal'd, it visited no more. If these live, and be read (as who shall dare Suspect, Truth, and thy Fame, immortall are?) What need thy noble Brother, or faire She, That is thy self, in purest imagrie; Whose breath, and Eyes, the Fun'rall-Spie, and flame Continue still, of gentle Buckingham; What need they send poore Pioners to grone, In lower Quarries for Corinthian stone? To dig in Parian Hills? since statues must, And Monuments, turne like our selves to dust: Verse, to all ages can our deeds declare, Tombs, but a while shew where our Bodies are. To Endimion Porter. Would thou wert dead! so strictly dead to me, That, nor my sight, nor my vex'd memorie Could reach thee more: so dead, that but to name Thou wert, might give the sawcie lie to Fame; That the bold Sonnes of Honour, and the milde Race of Lovers (both thy disciples stil'd) Might ask; who could the first example be To all their good? yet none should mention thee: Knocking at my Brest, when this hour is come; I hope, I once shall find my heart at home. Say thou art dead; yet whisper't but to me; For should thy so well-spent mortalitie, End to the world, and that sad end be knowne; I might (perhaps) still live, but live alone: The better world would follow thee, and all That I should gaine, by that large Funerall. Would be, the wanton vanity to boast, What they enjoy, was from my plenty lost. To the Countess of Carlile, on the death of the Earle her Husband. This Cypress folded here; in stead of Lawne, These Tapers winking, and these Curtaines drawne; What may they meane? unless to qualifie And check the lustre of your Eye, you'll trie To honour darkness, and adorne the Night, So strive, thus with your Lord, to bury Light. Call back, your absent Beauties to your care; Though clouded, and conceal'd, we know you are The Morning's early'st Beame, life of the Day, The Even's last comfort, and her parting Ray! But why these Teares, that give him no reliefe, For whom you waste the virtue of your griefe? Such, as might be prescrib'd the Earth, to drink For cure of her old Curse; Teares you would think Too rich to water (if ye knew their price) The chiefest Plant deriv'd from Paradise. But O! Where is a Poets faith? how farre We are miss-led? how false we Lords of Numbers are. Our Love, is passion, our Religion, rage! Since, to secure that mighty heritage Entail'd upon the Bay, see how I strive To keep the glory of your looks alive; And to perswade your gloomy Sorrows thence, As subt'ly knowing, your kind influence Is all the pretious stock, left us t'inspire, And feed the flame, of our eternall fire. But I recant: 'Tis fit you mourne a while, And winke, untill you darken all this Isle; More fit, the Bay should wither too, and be Quite lost, than he should lose your obsequie: He that was once your Lord; who strove to get That Title, cause nought else could make him great, A Title, by which his name he did preferre To have a day, i'th' Poets Kalender. His youth was gentle, and dispos'd to win, Had so much courtship in't, 'twas his chiefe sin; Yet sure, although his courtship knew the way To conquer Beauty; it did ne're betray. When wise with years, these soft affairs did cease, He whisper'd VVar abroad, then brought home Peace; He was supreme Ambassador, and went To be that Prince, whom Leigers but present; And soon with easie ceremonies got, VVhat they did lose with care, and a deep plot: Chearfull his age, not tedious or severe; Like those, who being dull, would grave appeare; VVhose guilt, made them the soule of Mirth despise, And being sullen, hope men think them wise. Yet he that kept his Virtues from decay, Had that about him needs must were away: The daily less'ning of our life, shewes by A little dying, how out-right to die: Observe the Morning, Noon, and Evening Sun, Then (Madam) you that saw his Hour-glass run, In wiser faith, will not be more opprest To see the last Sand fall, than all the rest. Epilogue, to LOVE and HONOR, A Tragicomedy. Troth Gentlemen, you must vouchsafe a while T'excuse my Mirth; I cannot chuse but smile! And 'tis to think, how like a subtle Spie, Our Poet waits, to hear his destinie: Just ith' pav'd-Entry as you passe; the place VVhere first you mention your dislike, or grace. Pray whisper softly, that he may not hear; Or else, such words, as shall not blast his Ear. Epilogue, to a Vacation Play at the Globe. The Speaker enter'd with a Sword drawn. For your own sakes (poor Souls!) you had not best Believe, my fury was so much supprest I'th'heat of the last Scene, as now you may Boldly, and safely too, cry down our Play! For if you dare but Murmure one false Note, Here in the House, or going to take Bote; By Heav'n I'le mowe you off with my long Sword; Yeoman, and Squire, Knight, Lady, and her Lord! VVith reason too; for since my whole part lies I'th' Play to Kill the King's chief Enemies; How can you scape? (be your own Judges) when You lay sad plots, to begger the Kings Men. To the QUEEN, upon a New-yeares day. This day, old Time, doth turne his Annuall Glass, And shakes it, that the Year may swiftly pass: This day; on which the formost leading-sand Falls from that Glass, shook by his hasty Hand: That Sand's th'exemplar Seed, by which we know How th'Hour's of the ensuing Year will grow. Awake, great Queen! for as you hide, or cleere Your Eyes, we shall discrust, or like the Yeare. Queenes set their Dialls by your beauties light; By your Eyes learne, to make their own move right; Yet know, our expectation when you rise Is not intirely furnish'd from your Eyes; But wisely we provide, how to rejoyce, In the fruition of your Breath, and Voice: Your breath, which Nature the example meant, From whence our early Blossomes take their scent; Teaching our Infant-Flow'rs how to excell (Ere strong upon their stalks) in fragrant smell: Your voice, which can allure, and charme the best Most gawdy-feather'd Chaunter of the East, To dwell about your Pallace all the Spring, And still can make him silent whilst you sing. Rise then! for I have heard Apollo sweare, By that first lustre, which did fill his Spheare; He will not mount, but make eternall Night, Unless reliev'd, and cherish'd by your Sight: Your sight; which is his warmth, now he is old, His Horses weary, and his Chariot cold. To Edward Earl of Dorset, after his Sickness, and happy Recovery. My Lord, I find the Gentry so o're-joy'd i'th' Town, As if all Prisons (safely) were rac'd down; As if the Judges would no more resist Wrongs with the Law, but each turne Duelist; And not with Statutes, but with Rapiers fence, At Mason's ward to succour Innocence. As if some trusty Poet now had bin Chosen with full voice City-Chamberlin; Their Treasure kept, and might dispose of it And th'Orphans Goods, as his free Muse thought fit; As if grave Benchers had been seen to weare Loud German Spurres, tall Feathers, and long Haire. Such wilde inversions, both of Men, and Lawes, Amaz'd my Faith, untill I knew, the cause Was your return to health; which did destroy All griefe in greater Minds, and swell their joy: Which made me gladly vow to dedicate Each Year, a solemn sacrifice to Fate; Such as should please old Esculapius too, More than dissected Cocks were wont to doe, (If there be Prophecie in Wine) and then You shall be known to Altars, as to Men Written, when Collonel Goring was believ'd to be slain at the Siege of Breda. His Death lamented by Endimion, Arigo The SCENE the Sea. ENDIMION. Ho! Pilot! change your Course! for know, we are Not guided by the Sea-mans usuall Starre: Storme-frighted-Foole! dull, wat'ry Officer? Dost thou our Voyage by the Compass steere? In all the Circle of thy Card, no Winde Tame or unruly, thou wilt ever finde Can bring us where the meanest on the Coast Immortall is, and a renowned Ghost. ARIGO. Let the assembled Winds in their next Warre, Blow out the light of thy old guiding Starre; Whilst on uncertaine VVaves, thy Bark is tost, Untill thy Card is rent, thy Rudder lost. Nor Star, nor Card, though with choice VVinde you fill Your Sailes (subdu'd by Navigators skill:) Can teach the rule thy Helme, 'till 'twaft us o're Pacifique Seas, to the Elisian Shore. ENDIMION. Who on that flow'ry Land, shall search his way, No mortall Pilots Compass must obay; Nor trust Columbus art, although he can Boast longer toyles, than he, or Magilan: Though in Sea-perills, he could talke them dumbe, And prove them lazy Criples; bred at home, By's travailes, he could make the Sun appeare, A young, and unexperienc'd Travailer. ARIGO. If thou wilt steere our course, thou must rely On some majestick, Epik-History; (The Poet's Compass) such as the blind Priest In fury writ, when like an Exorcist, His Numbers charm'd the Grecian Hoast; whose Pen, The Scepter was, which rul'd the Soules of Men, Survey his mystick Card; learn to what Coast, He did transport, each brave unbody'd Ghost, New shifted from his flesh; that valiant Crew, Which fierce Achilles, and bold Hector slew? ENDIMION. Enquire, where these are now? beneath what Shade, In dear-bought rest, their weary Limbs are laid, That trod on rugged wayes? for Honor still Leaves the smooth Plaine, t'ascend the rough, steep Hill. There seek, the Macedonian Youth; who knew No work so full of ease, as to subdue: Who scarce believ'd his Conquests worthy fame, Since others thought, his fortune overcame. ARIGO. Neer him, th'Epir of Warriour doth lie; Lookes, as he scorn'd his immortalitie, Because of too much rest; seems still at strife With Fate, for loss of troubles, not of life: Griev'd that to dye, he made such certain hast, Since being dead, the noble Danger's past. ENDIMION. Neer these go seek (with Mirtle over-grown) The Carthaginian Victor's shady Throne; Who there with sullen thoughts, much troubled lies; And chides the over-careful Destinies? That these Ambitious Neighbours thither sent So long before his birth; thus to prevent Dishonour at their deaths; O fond surmise, Of one, who when but mortal was so wise! As if betimes, they hastned to a Tombe, Lest he b'ing borne, they had been overcome. ARIGO. Neer him the wondrous Roman doth appear, Majestick, as if made Dictator there; Where now the Philosophick Lord, would heale The wound he gave him for the publick Weale: Which he more strives to hide; as sham'd his Eye Should find, that any wound could make him die. ENDIMION. If thou by the wise Poets Card or starre, Canst bring us where these faded Heroes are; Shift all thy Sayles, to husband ev'ry Winde; 'Till by a short swift passage we may find, Where Sidney's ever-blooming-Throne is spread; For now, since one renown'd as he is dead; (Goring, the still lamented, and belov'd!) He hath enlarg'd his Bow'r, and far remov'd His less Heroick Neighbours, that gave place To him; the last of that soon number'd Race. ARIGO. Whom he must needs delight to celebrate, Bacause himself, in manners and in Fate, Was his undoubted Type, Goring, whose name Though early up, will stay the last with Fame: ENDIMION. Though Sidney was his Type fulfill'd above What he foretaught, of Valor, Bounty, Love: Who dy'd like him, even there, where he mistook Betray'd by pitty then, to their defence, Whose poverty was all their innocence: And sure, if to their help a Third could come, Beguild by Honour, to such Martyrdome; Sufficient like these Two in braine, as blood; The world in time would think, their cause is good. ARIGO. Thus he forsook his glories being young: The Warriour is unlucky, who lives long; And brings his courage in suspect; for he That aimes at honour, i'th' supreme degree, Permits his Valor to be over bold, Which then ne're keeps him safe, 'till he be old. ENDIMION. His Bounty like his Valor, unconfin'd; As if not born to Treasure, but assign'd The rents of lucky War; each Day to be Allow'd, the profits of a Victory! Not of poor Farmes, but of the World the Lord! Heir, to intestate Nations by his sword, ARIGO. In Valor thus, and Bounty, rais'd above The vulgar height, so in designes of love; For onely gentle love could him subdue; A noble crime, which shew'd his Valor true: It is the Souldier's test; for just so far He yeilds to Love, he overcomes in War. ENDIMION. But why Arigo, do we strive to raise The Story of our loss, with helpless praise? Why to this Pilot mourne, whose Eares can reach Nothing less loud, than Winds or Waters breach! Or think that he can guide us to a Coast, Where we may find, what all the World hath lost? ARIGO. About then! Helme. a Lee! Endimion! see; Loose Wreaths (not of the Bay, but Cypress tree) Our Poet wears, and on the Shore doth mourn, Fearing, t' Elizium bound; we can't return, Steer back! his Verse may make those Sorrows last Which here, we 'mongst unhallow'd Sea-men waste. To the Lord Cary of Lepington, upon his Translation of Malvezzi. So swift is thought; this Morn I took my flight, To ruin'd Babel, and return'd to Night: So strong, that Time, (whose course no pow'r could slack) I have enforc'd some Forty ages back: To me, that great disorder and decay, Was both begun, and consummate to Day: My self, some strong Chaldean Mason there, Still sore with massie Stones they made me bear: Just now (methinks) I'me struck for some command Mistook, in words I could not understand. So lasting are great griefs, we still retaine Remembrance of them, though we loose the paine: And that Confusion did a grief comprise, Greatest, in that it most concern'd the Wise: For these (who best deserve the care of Fate) The first great Curse much less did penetrate, Which makes us labor for our food so long, Than that which mix'd, or cancell'd ev'ry tongue 'Cause now we toyle, and sweat for knowledge more, Than for the Body's nourishment before. Knowledge; ere it did practice to controle, No Weapon was, but Diet of the Soule; Which as her nourishments she might enjoy, Not like controverts, others to destroy: And this her Food (like Milk) did nourish best, 'Cause it was safe, and easie to digest: Which Milk, that Curse on Languages turn'd sowre, For men scarce taste what they could once devoure: Since now, we are preparing to be dead, Ere we can half interpret what we read. Yet he, that for our bodies took such care. That to each Wound, there several Med'cins are; In nobler pitty, surely hath assign'd A cure, for ev'ry mischief of the Mind: So this revenge (perhaps) was but to try Our patience first, and then our industry, Since he ordained, that beautious Truth should still Be overcast, and hid from humane skill; Sure he affects that War, which Schoolmen wage; When to know truth, doth make their knowledge rage; So Truth, is much more precious than our peace; Though some fond Politicks, esteem her less: Lazy obedience, is to them devout; And those rebellious that dispute or doubt: But you (my Lord) must valiantly despise Their threats, that would keep knowledg in disguise And toyl with Languages to make her clear; Which is to a be just Interpreter. And this selected peece, which you translate, Foretels, your studies may communicate, From darker Dialects of a strange Land, Wisdom, that here th' unlearn'd shall understand, What noble wonders may in time appear, VVhen all that's Forreign, grows domestick here? VVhen all the scatter'd world you reconcile, Unto the Speech, and Idiom of this Isle: How like a gen'ral Scepter rules that Pen, VVhich Mankind makes, one kind of Country-men? To Henry Jarmin. How wicked am I now? no Man can grow More wicked, till he swares I am not so: Since VVealth, which doth authorise men to err, Since Hope, (that is the lawfull'st Flatterer) VVere never mine one hour; yet am I loth To have less pride, then men possess'd of both: Fuller of glory, than old Victors be, That thank themselves, not Heav'n for Victorie: Prouder than Kings first Mistresses, who think Their Eies, gazing on Stars, would make Stars winke, That hope, they rule not not by Imperial place, But by some beautious Charter in the Face. Yet this my pride and glory, I think lost Unless declar'd, and heightned with a boast, Am I not bravely wicked then! and still Shall worse appear, in Nature as in will VVhen with my Malice (the grave VVit of Sin) T' excuse my self, I draw the whole VVorld in; Prove all in pride, in trival glory share; Though not so harmeless in't, as Poets are. VVhen Battails joyne alas! what is't doth move ('Gainst all Celestial harmony of Love) The Gallant VVarriour to assault this Foe? VVhose Vices, and whose Face, he ne're did know: VVhy would he kill? or why, for Princes fight? They quarrel more for glory, than for right: The pride then he defends, he'ld punish too, As if more Just in him, than in the Foe. Th' Ambitious States-man not himself admires For what he hath, but what his pride desires; Doth inwardly confess, he covets sway, Because he is too haughty to obay: VVho yeild to him, do not their reason please, But hope, their patience may procure them ease, How proudly glorious doth he then appear, VVhom ev'n the Proud, envy, the humble, fear. The Studious (that in Books so long have sought) VVhat our wise Fathers did, or what they thought) Admit not reason to be natural, But forc'd, harsh, and uneasie unto all: VVell may be it so, when from our Soul's Eyes, VVith dark Schoole-Clouds, they keep it in disguise: They seem to know, what they are loth t'impart; Reason (our Nature once) is now their Art: They by Sophistick, useless-science, trie T'ingage us still, to their false industry; T'unite that knot, which they themselves have ty'd, And had been loose to all, but for their pride; Their pride; who rule as chief on earth, because They only can expound, their own hard laws, Since thus, all that direct what others do, Are proud; why should not Poets be so too? Although not good, tis prosperous at least To imitate the greatest, not the best, Know then I must be proud! but when I tell The cause that makes my nourish'd glory swell, I shall like (lucky Pensils) have the fate T' exceed the Patterns which I imitate, This not implies, to be more proud than they, But bravely to be proud, a better way: And thus (Arigo) I may safely climbe, Rays'd with the boast, not loaden with the crime: Those with their glorious vices taken be, But I (most right'ously) am proud of thee. To Tho. Carew. 1 Upon my conscience whensoe're thou dy'st (Though in the black, the mourning time of Lent) There will be seen, in Kings-street (where thou ly'st) More triumphs, than in days of Parliament. 2 How glad, and gaudy then will Lovers be? For ev'ry Lover that can Verses read, Hath been so injur'd by thy Muse and thee, Ten Thousand, Thousand times, he wish'd thee dead. 3 Not but thy Verses are as smooth and high, As Glory, Love, or Wine, from wit can raise; But now the Devil take such Destinie! What should commend them, turnes to their dispraise. 4 Thy Wit's chief Vertue, is become its vice; For ev'ry Beauty thou hast rais'd so high, That now course-Faces carry such a price, As must undoe a Lover that should buy. 5 Scarce any of the Sex, admits commerce; It shames me much to urge this in a Friend; But more that they should so mistake thy Verse, Which meant to conquer, whom it did commend. To Doctor Duppa Dean of Christ-Church, and Tutor to the Prince. An acknowledgment for his Collection, in Honour of Ben. Johnson's Memory. How shall I sleep to night, that am to pay, By a bold vow, a mighty Debt ere Day? Which all the Poets of this Island owe: Like Paines neglected, it will greater grow. How vainly from my single stock of Wit, (As small, as is my Art, to Husband it) I have adventur'd what they durst not do, With strong confed'rate Art, and Nature too. This Debt hereditary is, and more Than can be pay'd for such an Ancestor; Who living, all the Muses Treasure spent, As if they him, their Heir, not Steward meant; Forrests of Mirtle, he disforrested, That near to Helicon their shades did spread; Like Modern Lords, w'are so of Rent bereft; Poets, and they have nought but Titles left: He wasted all in wreaths, for's conqu'ring Wit; Which was so strong, as nought could conquer it, But's Judgement's force, and that more rul'd the sense Of what he writ, than's Fancy's vast expence, Of that he still was lavishly profuse; For joyn the remnant-wealth of ev'ry Muse, And t'will not pay the Debt we owe to thee, For honors done unto his Memory: Thus then; he brought th'Estate into decay, With which, this Debt, we as his Heirs should pay. As sullen Heirs, when wastful Fathers die, Their old Debts leave for their posterity To clear; and the remaining Akers strive T' injoy, to keep them pleasant whilst alive; So I (alas!) were to my self unkind, If from that little wit, he left behind, I simply should so great a debt defray; I'le keep it to maintaine me, not to pay. Yet, for my soul's last quiet when I die, I will commend it to posterity: Although 'tis fear'd ('cause they are left so poor) They'll but acknowledge, what they should restore: However, since I now may erne my Bayes; VVithout the taint of flattery in praise; Since I've the luck, to make my praises true, I'le let them know, to whom this Debt is due: Due unto you, whose learning can direct Why Faith must trust, what reason would suspect: Teach Faith to rule, but with such temp'rate law, As Reason not destroys, yet keeps't in awe: Wise you; the living-Volume, which containes All that industrious Art, from Nature gaines; The useful, open-Book, to all unty'd; That knows more, than half-Knowers seem to hide And with an easie cheerfulness reveal, What they, through want, not sullenness conceal. That to great faithless-Wits, can truth dispence 'Till't turne, their witty scorne, to reverence: Make them confess their greatest error springs, From curious gazing on the least of things; With reading Smaller prints, they spoil their sight Darken themselves, then rave, for want of light: Shew them, how full they are of subtil sin, When Faith's great Cable, they would nicely spin To Reason's slender Threads; (then falsly bold) When they have weakned it, cry, t'will not hold! To him, that so victorious still doth grow, In knowledge, and t'inforce others to know; Humble in's strength; not cunning to beguile, Nor strong, to overcome, but reconcile: To Arts milde Conqueror; that is, to you, Our sadly mention'd Debt, is justly due: And now Posterity is taught to know, Why, and to whom, this Mighty Summe they owe, I safely may go sleep; for they will pay It all at times, although I break my Day. To his Excellency the Lord General Monck. Our fiery Sects scorn'd your triumphant night, When only Bonfires lent the City light. More proudly they like Nero did designe, The City's flame should make the Country shine: And all those Bells which rung in your applause, They would have melted to maintain the Cause. Alas! How little you in Action seem, When by their great intent we measure them? You the Fanatick party would correct; They rifle all rich Christians as a Sect. To Bonfires, you their rouling Pulpits turn; But they, instead of Tubs, would Churches burn. How weak are you, who to advance your cause, Call in the firm support of Church and Lawes? Their Independant strength boldly upbraides The old discretion of such formal Aides, You court the City, and the Nation too, They bravely meant to ravish whom you woo. Their daring Chiefs, a War did undertake, Follow'd by those, who still their Chiefs forsake. By such as only would consult and sway, But you chose those who fight and can obey. By their advantages you gain'd the field, And what they judg'd your weakness made them yield. As in destructive War, so you no less, Transcend them in the growing Arts of Peace. You can converse, and in a dialect, Where no strange dress makes us the truth suspect; Where plainess graceful is, and free from blame, As truths fair Nakedness is free from shame. They write the style of Spirits, you of Men; Yet are their Swords less powerful then your Pen. Auspicious Leader! None shall equal thee, Who mak'st our Nation and our Language free. The first they fetter, not with publick Lawes, But with their Wills, peculiar as their Cause. Our Language with such Scripture-phrase restrain, As makes the borrow'd holiness prophane. And such strange crimes attempt that whilst they lack All precedents for Plea, they wrest and rack The good old Prophets, till they falsly draw, From ill translated Hebrew English Law. How soon, how boldly, and how safely too, Have you dispatch't what not an age could do? Yet greater work ensues, such as will try How far three Realms may on your strength rely. Nor can our Hope need Anchors where we find A sudden Courage and delib'rate mind. In doubtful Battails we may trust your Sword, And in suspected Factions take your word. POEM upon His Sacred Majestie's most happy Return to His Dominions. When from your Towns all hastned to the shore, What shame could urge your peoples blushes more, Than to behold their Royal Martyr's Son Appeas'd, even with their grief for what was done? So great your Mercy is, that you will grieve, If your wise Senate cannot all forgive. Nor can the Spies of Malice e're discern, That you from Interest did this Vertue learn. Great Julius in disguise, might act that part: But Nature has in you out-done his Art. Your perfect Father to such height did come Of God-like pitty, near his Martyrdom, That he his Subject-Judges did forgive, And left it as their punishment to live. Pitty not onely flowes from him to you, But doubly, from your Mother's Mercy too: The limits of it none could ever know, Nor to the bounds of her compassion go; Whose Father in forgiveness did transcend The insolence of all that durst offend; When his Remorse seem'd led by their Despair, Beyond the sight of Hope, or voice of Prayer. No more shall your bold Subjects strive to Reign; And fatal Honour on each other gain. Their courage, which mistook the way to Fame, (And may find pitty where it meets with shame) Shall, by your valor guided, far out-shine Our Glory got in France and Palestine. No more shall sacred Priests fall from their own Supported Pow'r, by shrinking from the Throne: Nor in divided shapes that Garment tear, Which their Great Chief did whole and seemless wear. No more shall any Antient of our Law, From old Records such Modern Meaning draw, As made even Lawyers lawless, and enquire, How justly Kings to armed Pow'r aspire? The Civil Robe did Swords Power suspect, Though onely Armed Pow'r can Law protect; And rescue Wealth from Crowds, when Poverty Treads down those Laws on which the Rich rely. Yet Law, where Kings are arm'd, rescues the Crowd Even from themselves, when Plenty makes them proud. No more shall any of the Noble Blood Too faintly stem the People's rising Flood. But when the Wind, Opinion does grow loud, Moving like waves, the Many-headed Crowd; Then those great Ships shall fast at Anchor ride, And not be hurri'd backward with the Tyde. The Throne's the Port to which their Course shall bear, As well at distance too as sailing near: Or, Anch'ring, shall for change of weather stay, And never lose when they can gain no way. No more shall publick wealth on Spies be spent, To hunt the Loyal and the Innocent: Nor Jaylors in contracted Prisons be The Keepers of the Peopl's Libertie: Nor Chiefs in Civil Causes toyl, and do The task of Judges, and of Jurors too; In whose High-Courts their Wills for Laws were known. And all the Civil Pow'r was Martial grown. How useful must the Regal Office be, Where both those Pow'rs for publick good agree? Where Justice in a Ballance weighs the Cause, And wears a Sword but to enforce the Laws. When (Mighty Monarch) your Three Nations count To what their gain, by gaining you, will mount; They justly reckon, that the least you bring Of Greatness is, that Blood which makes you King: And casting up what Satisfaction they, In full return of all your Vertues, pay; The Product shews, you bring in value more, Than those Three Realms, which they do but restore. You bring such Clemency, as shews you have More Pardons, than your God-like-Father gave. Which shews a Greatness that does most incline To what is greatest in the Pow'r Divine. 'Tis that to which all Human kind does bow, And tend'rest sense of obligation owe. For wretched Man (by ev'ry passion led, Born sinful, and to many errors bred) Has use of Mercy still, and does esteem Creation a less work than to Redeem. You bring a Judgement deeper than the Sea: And as in deepest Seas we fafest be, So in your Judgement's depths we may endure All Empire's suddain storms, and sleep secure. And as in deaper Seas we never sound, Or seek that Depth which never can be found, (Unless as Pilots, who for trial, near The Ocean's Borders, cast a Plummet there; But cease to sound when they no bottom find) So, whilst I try to measure your deep Mind, I stop even at the Verges of your Court, Knowing my Plummet light, and Line too short. You bring, with depth of Judgment, all the height And fire of Thought, that can give wings to Weight. A Mind so swift, that in a moment's space Not only flies o're the Diurnal Race, But does collect all objects of the Sun, And marks, what through the Globe the Great have done. You no endowment can like this possess, Which will preserve what Valor can increase. For Pow'r requires an universal Eye: It should like yours, see all and suddainly. If thus it watch not ever for the State, It either sees too little, or too late. You bring such Valour as dares farther tread, Then Love dares follow; or Ambition lead. Valour, so watchful as may safely keep A Camp untrencht, and suffer Scouts to sleep: Fit to surprise Surprizers early Spys, It danger loves, as good for exercise. The honor you near Severn's Banks obtain'd, Did make the victors lose by what they gain'd; When you reclaim'd their malice, who with shame Blush't that they kept your Realms, yet gave you fame. You bring such charming vertues as move more Then all the secret gifts of bounteous Pow'r: Your kind approaches to invite access; Your patient Eare to troublesome Distress. Your nat'ral greatness, never artful made, Nor so retir'd as if you sought a shade. And by reserv'dness would misterious seem: As formal men retire to get esteem. But you would so be visible and free, As Truth and Valor still would publick be. Those hate obscureness and would still be shown, They grow more lov'd as they become more known. You bring Religion, which before like Fame, Was nothing but a Trumpet and a Name. Here most seem'd holy but in Masquerade; Most vizards wore, and in disguise were clad. Abroad, your firme Religion gain'd renown Through all the trials of Comparison. It will, at home, unmask dissembling Art; And what was wholy Face shall grow all Heart. Thus shewing what you are, how quickly we Infer what all your Subjects soon will be! For from the Monarchs vertue Subjects take, Th' ingredient which does publick-vertue make. At his bright beam they all their Tapers light, And by his Dial set their motion right; Your Clemency has taught us to believe It wise, as well as vertuous, to forgive. And now the most offended shall proceed In great forgiving till no Laws we need: For Laws slow progresses would quickly end, Could we forgive as fast as men offend. Revenge of past offences is the cause Why peaceful minds consented to have Laws. Yet Plaintiffs and Defendants much mistake Their cure, and their diseases lasting make; For to be reconcil'd, and to comply, Would prove their cheap and shortest remedy. The length and charge of Laws vex all that sue; Laws punish many, reconcile but few. Intire forgiveness, thus deriv'd from you, Does Clients reconcile and Factions too. No Faction shall hereafter own a name; But their distinctions vanish with their shame. Your careful judgment teaches us to prize Affliction, and to grow, by troubles, wise. To clear the sullen count'nance of Distress; And not with haste precipitate redress. Your judgments patience has ev'n vertue taught That her reward should be with patience sought. Tis else requir'd too boldly and too soon; As if she boasted that her work was done. We shall not boast of constant Loyalty, Whose Light goes out, when held by us too high. It is a vertue, but 'tis duty too; And our reward is had in having you. Your minds swift motion (which hath often brought Actions, even farther past, to instant thought; Which in a moment does all compass run; And then contract all objects into one: And judge all Empires as the Sun might do, If he had life and reason too like you.) Has taught our feeble Thoughts to mend their pace; And follow though they lose you in the Race. And now your Nations shall with early Eves, Watch the first Clouds e're storms of Rebels rise. Though Orators (the Peoples Witches) may Raise higher Tempests then their skill can lay; Making a civil and staid Senate rude, And stopless as a running multitude: Yet can they not to full rebellion grow; Not knowing how much now the People know; Who from your influence have' attain'd the wit Not to proceed from grudgings to a Fit. Your Valour has our rasher courage taught To do, not what we dare, but what we ought; Not to pretend renown from high offence; Nor braver boldness turn to impudence? Nor claim a right where we by force enjoy; Nor boast our strength from what we can destroy. Your other Vertues bear instructive sway: Their fair examples we like Laws obey; Which through your Realms such Harmony disperse, As if Love rul'd, and Laws were writ in Verse. Whilst our Civilities grow so refin'd That now they more then former Statutes bind, The high in pow'r, make their approaches low, To meet and lift the humble when they bow. Such English-stifeness freely they forsake, As made wise Strangers wonder and go back. Your firm Religion shall our firmness breed, And turn into a Rock our shaken Reed. A Rock, which like a rowling wave before Flow'd with the Flood, and ebb'd with ebb's of Pow'r, And that respect which your indulgent Eye, Pays as your blessed Fathers Legacy. To sacred Priests, with chearful bounty's too, Does teach what we with rev'rence ought to do, And well may Priests (who are Heav'ns Liegers) be Nobly defray'd in ev'ry Embasie: They treat not for the profit of that King, From whose bright Palace they Credentials bring. But for the Peoples benefit to whom They are in pitty sent and charg'd to come. To these we shall with rev'rence Off'rings make; Which they may justly and with honour take. 'Tis done with some respect when Princes give Gifts to Ambassadours, and they receive Those gifts with confidence, as if they knew, Though they are gifts, yet Custom makes them due. Too boldly, (awful Monarch) am I gone, Through all your Guards, to gaze about your Throne. Yet 'tis the use of Greatness to excuse, The daring progress of the sacred Muse: She taught the Lover, love, and Warriour, war; And is the Guide, when Honour would go far, The Studious follow, till they lose their sight, When to the upper Heav'n she makes her flight. She mounts above what they pretend to know, And leaves their soaring Thoughts in depths below. Why nam'd I Heav'n, where all meet all reliefs, Where best of joys succeed the worst of Griefs; Yet naming it, must Clouds of sorrow wear, For that dire cause which brought your Father there? Kings must to Heav'n through shades of sorrow pass, And taking leave of Nature, Death imbrace. But he, with more then a devout intent, To people soon that Heav'n to which he went. Did, dying, leave three Nations (when they count To what his vallew, and their loss will mount. What he did suffer, and what they did do) Sorrow enough to bring them thither too. Much was he favour'd by the Pow'r Divine, Which to encourage Vertue with some signe, Or likely taste of future happiness, Did let him many blessings here possess. Your Royal Mother, in his life, fulfill'd All griefs that Mourning Widowhood could yield; And has continu'd, since he reign'd above, Her care o're all the Pledges of their love. You, in your Manhoods bloome, exprest an aw, Not of his Regal but of Natures Law: Obeying him in all, by no designe, Or force, but so as Nature did incline. And with your growth your kind obedience grew; Which love, not precept shew'd you was his due. You rev'renc'd him in deep afflictions more, Then on those heights where he did shine before. This vertuous softness made your people melt; Who in your triumph all that kindness felt Which to their Saint your duty had exprest, And drew from ev'ry Eye, and ev'ry Breast, Such tears and sighs, as in a happy time, Pay'd back your sorrows, and excus'd their crime. And your heroick Brothers (early grown Fame's Favorites, and Rivals in renown) Did in their Dawne such beams of comfort give As they had almost made him wish to live. That he might see the Glory of their Noon: But ah! Lifes glass he shook to make it run. The mighty-Martyr gaz'd on Heav'ns reward: Then struggling Nature found him strait too hard For all her force, Religion watcht the strife; And Honour call'd him back from proffer'd Life. T'will not suffice (best King) that we have shown Your Picture, with Two worthy's next your Throne: But we would now of all the Copy's boast From such a great Orig'nal as is lost. Two, of the gentler Sex, remain to grace The matchless number of his Royal Race. The First, with practis'd patience, even when young, Whilst various winds made storms of Empire long) Has liv'd the great example, and the good, Of graceful and of prudent Widow-hood. The other has fit vertue to dispence, Even to a Cloyster'd Virgin, innocence; And such discretion as might Factions guide; And so much beauty as She much might hide, Yet lend that Court, where Lilly's wildly grow, More then their glorious Nuptials now can show. Tell me, (O Fame!) what triumph thou would'st sound? In all thy boasted Flights thou scarce hast found One Theam like mine. Ascend! and strait disperse (As far as ever Thou wert led by Verse, Or Light ere flew) my Sov'raign's full renown: Then rest thy wings, and lay thy Trumpet down. POEM to the Kings most Sacred Majesty. Though Poets (Mighty King) such Priests have bin As figur'd Virtue and disfigur'd Sin; Did in so fair a shape Religion draw, As might, like Beauty, both allure and awe: Did rigid Rules in cheerful Songs disperse; Whilst all were Lai'ty but who dealt in Verse: Yet now of Priesthood they retain no more Then frequent cause Compassion to implore: For if there any shadow'd strokes appear, By which to Priests they can resemblance bear, It onely may be said that both agree In willing or unwilling Povertie. Though Poets with the Poor now reckon'd are, (Whom all expose to God's peculiar care) Yet as the Poor by want great Gainers be, When Want leads them to God for Remedie; So Poets, when their Days are over-cast, And from their Noon, they to the Evening haste, When Age, which is their longest Winter, stays T' increase their shame by shewing their decays; When that long Winter grows at last so keen That even their Bays cannot continue Green, Yet against Frosty Age they may be arm'd: Poets by double Infl'ence have bin warm'd, And therefore may expect a Second Spring: We had our Phœbus, and have now our King, Whose Palace to th' Afflicted is as free As Temples where they God's Domesticks be. How happy is Affliction which may come Where God allows not Merit any room? Kings fit their Gifts to those who them receive, And to Affliction so much favor give, As may not well to Merit be allow'd, Lest those they would encourage should grow proud. Kings, wisely jealous, watch how Merit grows, That they may know it ere it self it knows. Auspicious Monarch! here I lose my way: Yet as those Sea-men luckily did stray, Who with Columbus were by Tempests blown, Till they from Wand'rers were Discov'rers grown, And found rich Nature's last Reserve, a new Great World; so I by Storms am brought to you: By Storms of Grief, which in my barren Breast, Like Winds in Desarts, with themselves contest. Yet 'tis not abject Grief, such as does mourn For want of Wealth the Body to adorn; But rather Sorrow of a noble kind, Which does complain for maint'nance of the Mind; For want of that dexterity of Thought, Which in a moment has to Fancy brought All scater'd Forms collected till she spie A single Map of all Diversity; As at an instant to the rising Sun All Objects are compris'd and made but one. That heat is spent which did maintain my Bays; Spent early in your God-like Father's praise; Who left the World more than it ever knew Before so great and good, his Fame and Tou. By many Wonders you were hither brought; Which strangely too, by their concurrence wrought Our whole Redemption in so short a space As did the sloath of humane aids disgrace. Those who did hold Success the Cast of Chance, And Providence the Dream of Ignorance, Might in these Miracles Design discern, And from wild Fortune's looks Religion learn. Yet when we shall contemplate God, from whom Your Crown did through a Cloud of Terrors come: When all those cares to which it must submit, And ceremonious forms which wait on it Are fully summ'd (Cares which to Age belong, And forms which tire, with tedious length, the Young) Then like the Law which Moses had from Heaven, It seems to be imposed as well as given. You now are destin'd to more watchful care Then Spies of Faction or the Scouts of War; To Care which higher and more swiftly flows Than that which from design of Conquest grows; Such as may seem to other Monarchs new; Care to reform those whom you might subdue. Conquest of Realm's compar'd to that of Minds, Shews but like mischief of outragious Winds; Making no use of force but to deface, Or tear the rooted from their native place. Who by distress at last are valiant made, And take their turn Invaders to invade. From Woods they march victorious back agen To Cities, the Wall'd-Parks of Hearded-men. Victors by conqu'ring Realms are not secure; Nor seem of any thing, but hatred sure A King who conquers Minds does so improve The Conquer'd that they still the Victor love. How can you rest where Pow'r is still alarm'd: Each Crowd a Faction, and each Faction arm'd? Who fashions of Opinion love to change, And think their own the best for being strange, Their own if it were lasting they would hate; Yet call it Conscience when 'tis obstinate. When weary of a Scepter here, they flie To seek new fashions of Authority In foreign States, then bring Rebellion home, And take just Punishment for Martyrdom. The Saints of old, not strugling for defence, Did satisfie themselves with innocence: In Deaths stern Court did gracefully appear, And civil to their worst Tormentors were. But these so fullen are, as if they thought Saints could not Death defie unless they fought: As if their Church should spring not from the seed Of their own blood, but that which others bleed. Though Conscience is in others secret shame Of doing ill, yet they in publick claim Not onely freedom for the ills they do, But call for liberty to preach them too. They seek out God in cruel Camps, and boast They God have found, when they have Nature lost; Nature, the publick Light which is held out To all dim Minds who do of God-head doubt. She openly to all does God-head shew; Faith brings him, like a Secret but to few. Sects, who would God by private Opticks reach, Invent those Books by which themselves they teach; And whilst with Heaven they too familiar grow, They to the Gods on earth disdain to bow. You safe amongst these diff'rent Sects remain, Where all would rule, and each a while did reign: And having reign'd, are apt to reckon it Worse than Idolatry when they submit. And though these Sects in Doctrine diff'rent be, Yet in the uses of it they agree, Which first they for the novelty approve, And after for the gainful mischief love. What confidence but yours durst undertake To give them Laws, who dare Religion make? Whose private Conscience checks the publick Laws, Whilst many Modern Sects have one old Cause. That Feaver, Zeal (the Peoples desp'rate fit) You cool, and without bleeding, master it: Dissembled Zeal (Ambitions old disguise) The Vizard in which Fools out-face the Wise. You keep with prudent arts of watchful care Divided Sects from a conjunctive War; And when unfriendly Zeal from Zeal dissents, Look on it like the War of Elements; And, God-like, an harmonious World create Out of the various discords of your State. Kings safest are when Zealots furious grow Then when their malice will no passion show: For Thrones should ever fear to be surpris'd; Not dreading Arms display'd but Foes disguis'd: Sects which through zealous brav'rie not submit, Deal plainly but when tame they counterfeit. When swelling Subjects are victorious grown, They leave, like Nile, where it has overflown, Monsters from fatness of corruption sprung, Which as they grow up soon so last not long, A monsters hasty birth makes that ill shape From which, as soon as seen, men strive to scape, With sodain strangeness it does Strangers fright; And they as quickly chase it from their sight. So Sects, with monstrous impudence, may scare A while, those who their boldness soon out-dare. These, when by Justice of the Laws subdu'd, Call their unwilling Suff'rings Fortitude, Or Conscience, though they nothing use to bear But from the basest cause of Conscience, fear. Through hideous Monsters, by Religion bred, And by the choice of humane slaughters fed, You move so boldly, that they rather seem To strive to scape from You, than You from them. The truth of Resurrection is by You Confirm'd to all, and made apparent too; Apparent in the Church, the world's best part; For of the world's whole Body 'tis the Heart, The Church You have reviv'd: for well we may Confess it more than rescu'd from decay, Since having lost, by Martyrdom, the Head, The Limbs had all the signs of being dead. But though, when it does flourish, Sects deride The Churches Ornaments as Papal pride; Yet why with Sects (whose Congregations are But Men well disciplin'd for Civil War, Not meek Assemblies but a sullen Crowd, Who out of haughty pride disdain the Proud) Should Calvin's froward Sect be rudely bent, Like Zealous Goths, against all Ornament? Why do they verbal Ornaments esteem In Pulpits where they garnish out their Theme; And are in doctrine to their spir'tual Guests Long as in Graces which but cool their Feasts? VVith Flow'rs of Rhet'rick they intice the Ear, As if they and their Audience Poets were. If they in curious Tropes and Figures Preach (VVhich were the Ethnick Ornaments of Speech) And to our Ears provocatives allow, VVhy should our Eyes th'allurements want of Show? All these You have forgiv'n; so much forgiv'n That such an Act ne'r pass'd unless in Heav'n. Their crimes are so much banish'd from your Mind, As if You had forgot what Act You sign'd. Yet who dares say You not remember it? Since You as much of Courage, Faith, and VVit, Have shewn in keeping still that Act in force, As when it first was sign'd You shew'd remorse. Thus thorowly to pardon does comprise The utmost goodness that in Greatness lies. If we consider what in God does seem To be that Goodness which we most esteem; And which should Temples fill with his applause; It is, that all his Messages and Laws And of his works, all that to us are known Are fashion'd for our int'rest not his own. So by example of his goodness, You An int'rest diff'rent from your own pursue. For Such your mercy is that even your Foes Gain by their crimes what You by virtue lose. But though this does appear the utmost height That Mercy e're did reach at her first flight; Yet yours at last so high a pitch may fly That even the Tempters of your constancy (Who did the force of human reason bring Against your heav'nly strength of pardoning, And what was done did labour to undoe) You, as your hardest task, will pardon too. To royal Faith (preserv'd inviolate By native honour, not design of State) Conspicuous blessings, as rewards, are due, Which we receive, and owe them all to You. For after Twenty years in rapines spent (Th'illegal Acts of Lawless Parliament) In Fields we Harvests find, in Cities Wealth, And after War, the Sire of Sickness, Health. If Nations by the plenty they obtain, When youthful Monarchs have begun their reign, May prophesie degrees of future Store, No Prince e're brought so much, or promis'd more. To You, who still are easie of access, Suitors can need no Guide but their distress. And though Distress long in complaint appears, That length no measure with your patience bears. You can indure a tedious narrative, And suffer the Afflicted to believe His Case is not as others cases are, But intricate, and very singular; And that it never yet at best appear'd Because he never has bin fully heard; And it would find redress could it be known To any comprehension but his own. Some Princes that they may the rumour gain Of minding bus'ness, mighty bus'ness feign; And are lockt up, to have it then suppos'd They are more thoughtfull when they are inclos'd; But they from Concourse privately remove Only to shun what they pretend to love. Pow'r which it self does so reserv'dly keep, As if the being seen would make it cheap, Should use the proper Seasons for retreat: For though decrepid Age may think it meet To hide stale objects from the Peoples sight; Yet in a Thrones new glory all delight: All love young Princes in their flourishing, As all, with joy, walk out to see the Spring. Your Countries Genius and your own agree To make you rule as Soveraign of the Sea. Nature has nothing made more unconfin'd Than your strong Island, but your mighty Mind. You love the Sea, which the unpractis'd fear; 'Tis your own Element and proper Spheare. Their fear does from their thoughtless ign'rance grow, Your love does from your Study'd knowledge flow. So knowing Minds to God affection bear, Whom th' Ignorant are only apt to fear. Since You are prone by Nature to discern All that by Naval Art men strive to learn, You, with peculiar Glory, will obtain That Neptune's pow'r which Poets did but feign. The Neighb'ring Monarch (wealthy and at ease) Will build a City all of Palaces: A work which does the Founders wealth express, And that he weary is of that access: Why should he else his solid Treasure waste To make the shadow of his Mem'ry last? Since by that strength which he from Quarries brings, To make his Name out-wear all other things, He but provides his purpose to prevent; His name may perish e're the Monument: For many a City built for future Fame Has long out-liv'd the vanisht Founders name. By that tall Pyramid (which does appear The strongest Pile that Art did ever rear) Egyptians now themselves like strangers pass, And but in vaine, ask who the Artist was? Ev'n of the Learn'd but few so curious seem As to desire to know the name of him For whom 'twas built: and both their aims have lost, One in his Art, the other in his Cost. Great Monsters, Cities, over-grown with Pow'r, Do Neighb'ring Towns by hungry Trade devour. You Cities build which not destructive be; Ships grown to Fleets are Cities of the Sea. And Ships by Trade each other still improve More fruitfully than Sexes do by love. Ships, which to farthest distances are sent, Are so concern'd their number to augment, That they by nought but Number can dispence The vital heat of Trade, Intelligence. By pow'r of Number they themselves disperse For a Collection, through the Universe, Of all the Freights which ev'ry Country yeilds From work of Cities or from growth of Fields. They grow to be a Squadron, then they meet In a free Road, and make a friendly Fleet; Where patience, as her hardest trial, finds How much they can indure who wait on Winds. From thence (suppli'd at length with sev'ral Gales) Each to her proper Course does spread her Sails. Sea-men, in loudest Storms, are not dismay'd When they are even oblig'd to be afraid: For of what use can high confusion seem (When Winds and Waves strive which shall be supreme, And Nature does a frightful Vizard wear) Unless it be, to teach the World to fear? Bold Pyrats, with a Frantick courage, dare Maintain against the World continual War; No Traveller is from those Robbers free On Natures own High-way, the common Sea: But though they dare all other Tempests meet, Yet still they fear the Thunder of your Fleet. What Monarch would make Levies and provide To exercise his Valor, or his Pride, Against some little peremptory Town, Whose Bullworks and Redoubts so high are grown, That it does rather seem but basely hid By Rebels fears than proudly Fortifi'd? VVhen he a Town has so by Sluces drown'd, That 'tis by nought but tops of Steeples found, He may march home, and poor with triumph, boast That what he gain'd he cheaper might have lost: VVhilst other Kings, in taking Towns, displease Their Subjects, You, for yours, take all the Seas. You to divert your cares (those ill-bred Guests VVhich most unruly grow in Princes Breasts VVhere they are oft'nest lodg'd) can lend your Eye To Ornament, your Ear to Harmony: So Nature, when she Fruit designs, thinks fit VVith Beautious Blossoms to proceed to it: And whilst she does accomplish all the Spring, Birds to her secret operations sing. Kings, to the stretch of thought for ever bent, Have chang'd his Image whom they represent: VVho in Creation wrought not hard nor long: His work is still as easie as 'tis strong: As all was by his sodain Fiat wrought, So 'tis preserv'd without his pains or thought. From cruel bondage You the Muses free, And yet restrain the Poets liberty; But so restrain him that he now does find 'Tis but the evil Spirit which you bind. The Muse is now, by her conversion, taught Gladly to lose that freedom which she sought: How wild her flights have been untill restrain'd; And, by your power, how greatly has she gain'd? By bad Idæas she did Heroe's paint; But now, You of a Muse have form'd a Saint. Men knew not what they took or Monarchs gave, VVhen they did liberty of Subjects crave: Even Poets would, like other Subjects, be Licentious Writers had they libertie; And study all the madness of freewill, VVhich is, old English Freedom to do ill. The Theatre (the Poets Magick-Glass In which the Dead in vision by us pass; Where what the Great have done we do again, But with less loss of time and with less pain) Is in the Scene so various now become, That the Dramatick Plots of Greece, and Rome, Compar'd to ours, do from their height decline, And shrink in all the compass of design. Where Poets did large Palaces intend, The spacious purpose narrowly did end In Houses, where great Monarchs had no more Removes than Two low Rooms upon a Floor: Whose thorow lights were so transparent made, That Expectation (which should be delai'd And kept a while from being satisfi'd) Saw, on a sudden, all that Art should hide; Whilst at the plain contrivance all did grieve; For it was there no trespass to deceive. If we the antient Drama have refin'd, Yet no intrigues, like Lab'rinths, are design'd, In Counterturns so subtle as but few, VVhen entred, can get forth without a Clue: VVhere Expectation may intangled be, But not so long, as never to get free: VVhere Love throughout the Character does last; And such unblemish'd love as all the chaste May still endure with publick confidence, And not at vanquish'd Beauty take offence; VVhere Valour we so probable express, That we should wrong the Great to make it less. If to reform the publick Mirrour (where The Dead, to teach their living Race, appear) May to the People useful prove, even this (VVhich but the object of your leisure is To respite Care, and which successivelie Three of our last wise Monarchs wish'd to see, And in a Century could not be wrought) You, in Three years, have to perfection brought. If 'tis to height of Art and Virtue grown, The form and matter is as much your own As is your Tribute with your Image coin'd: You made the Art, the Virtue You enjoyn'd. But now methinks, I hear my Pinnacc hal'd! Which boldly in a Mist too far has sail'd; And I discover, through the Glass of Fear, That the whole world's High-Admirall is near. Too long my wither'd Lawrel I have worn; The Poet's Flag, by Grief's foul weather torn: Grief which is taught by Reason to complain, That I, when all are better'd by your Reign, Should seem unworthy, in my ?F?aded Bays, To carry Fame a Present of your Praise. Whoever is more happily design'd To bear a Present of this noble kind (Which Empress Fame to all the World will show, And which examin'd will more valu'd grow) Must from the Muses his Credentials take; Who both the Embassy and Present make. And as he knows from whom he comes, so he Should not to Sov'raign Fame a Stranger be; For Fame (whose custom is to have a care Onely of those who her Familiars are) Does with a proud neglect o're Strangers flie, As if unworthy of her Voice or Eye, She seldom is acquainted with the Young, And weary is of those who live too long. When the wise world, by correspondence, shall To gen'ral Council ev'ry Poet call For prudent choice of this Ambassadour, Then all that Session it will soon abhor: Those who in concord there and glory came, Shall part from thence in discord and in shame. The young will not agree who is too young, Nor th'old determine who has liv'd too long. And as in free Assemblies each may prize His single worth to gen'ral prejudice; And in the votes of chusing, every voice May stop some progress in the publick choice; So now (where none their own defects will see, And each would for the whole elected be) Th' Election likely is to end in vain; All loosing that which each presum'd to gain. The Muses proud Ambassadour may stay His journey ere he does begin his way; And keep his great Poetick Present too: Which may prove well for Poets Fame and You. Poets are truly poor, but onely then When each a Hero lacks for his own Pen. They pine when mighty Arguments are scant; And not when they that trifle, Treasure, want. As at such dearth they languish, so they seem To swell when they have got a plentious Theme, For rashly then the Muses take their flight: Yet as a man, o're-joy'd at sodain sight Of Treasure found, grows jealous, and through care Lest others in his Prize should claim a share, Bears hastily from that which he did find Much less away than what he leaves behind: So, whilst thus rashly I convey to Fame Your Virtues, I so few of them proclaim That many more are left behind unprais'd, Than those which on this Poem's Wings are rais'd. How glad will all discreeter Poets be, Because (whilst in their choice they disagree) They this imperfect Present shall prevent, Which darkens You to whom it lustre meant; Or rather it does quite extinguish me; Who looking up to You, do onely see I by a fainting Taper lose my aim, And, lifting it too high, put out the flame. Fame may rejoyce when any Image wrought Thus ill, is never to her Temple brought: She should examine what she does receive, And Poets watch the worth of what they give. Kings rais'd to Heaven, by an unskilful Pen, Scarce look, when made ill Gods so well as Men. The Painter whose Spectators were at strife Which the resemblance was, and which the life, Deserv'd high praise when he a Face did draw; The Face, which all suppose he often saw; But when we mention Homer's high renown, Apelles then may lay his Pencil down: For Heav'n ne'r made but one, who, being blind, Was fit to be a Painter of the Mind. As justly Poets may with Fame rejoyce, That Songs of Worthies set below her voice, (Where Numbers rise not to Heroick height) Are hindr'd from accompany'ng her flight; So you, your self, may be content to see, That though all Poets in your praise agree, Yet all, with joynt submission, think not one Can, at the rate your virtue has begun, So follow you with offer'd Wreaths, as you Do other Hero's for their Wreaths pursue. Behind your Chariot Poets lag with shame, As if the Num'rous Feet of Verse were lame. But then 'tis time to cast my Anchor here: Who dares bear Sail where none are fit to steer? Or how dare Poets venture at your praise? For though so great a Trophie none can raise But Poets, yet the weight of it they fear, As wanting strength to move what they should rear. All Painters strait would lay their Pencils by, Were they enjoyn'd to paint the Deity. Hereafter of what use will Numbers prove, If in that Theme we fail which most we love? But though this kind of Trophy needs excuse, Yet even a Poem is of greater use Than any other work, by which your name We would to all succeeding Times proclaime: And, since your name should be perpetual made, You must vouchsafe t' accept a Poet's aid. Poets still made the mighty Hero's known, And drew in full proportions their Renown; Which Fame can onely, by the pow'r of Verse, Ever preserve, and ev'ry where disperse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS ON Several Occasions, Never before Printed. POEM TO THE Earl of Orrery. My Lord, I will hoist saile; and all the wind My Barke can bear shall hasten me to find A great new World: for since Philosophie Plainly discovers any man to be A little World, 'tis consequent that you Must be a great, and may be reckon'd new, If my discovery draw the Curtain more, And make the Object wider then before: There prospects are not seen in shadow'd Lights; No darkness hides your depths, no Cloud your heights. So dear is all about your radiant Minde That Ignorance seems now through Envy blinde; Whilst Envy grows reclaim'd, and turnes aside, Griev'd only that her shame she cannot hide. And yet as he, whose first discovery Did for this world the new West-World descry, Attain'd some glory, though he found not then More then in misty Woods the tracks of men; So some renown may be already due To me, for but beginning to find you. Unless I vaunt, and am audacious grown When in the Poets Mapp I write you down A new discover'd World found out by me; As if your Mindes great Flame could hidden be From any Eyes; a minde so eminent As does the need of being sought prevent. You are the great discov'ry made by all; And it would seeme as much fantasticall To say that you were found by me alone, As if I boasted that I found the Sun; Which to the publick shines, and sends the light That shews us him, and makes us find our sight. Besides, as he who made discovery Of the west-world, could not directly ply To make those Harbours which he after found; Who, though he westward; steer'd, was no where bound; So can I not to you, no, not by guess, Appoint my self particular access, Till, coasting part of you, your depths be found; Which no Line else but length of Time can sound. And as he knew not, when he first saw Land, The place of Silver Oare, or Golden Sand; Nor knew to dive near Rocks where Mermaids dwell And lock their Pearles in Cabinets of shell; So are there several treasures of your minde, Which none but such wise Travellers can find As long within your Mindes vast Country stay And get advice to perfect their survey. And as at first, ere any dreames he told Of his new world to any of our old, Though he slept well, not starting then with feare He should mistake his course, or want Mines there; Yet he did often grieve, and doubtfull grow That this unworthy World scarce ought to know Even whence he would set saile, or with what winde; Much less possess the Mountaines he should finde. So I have tenderness enough to doubt Whither this world should learne to find you out: Where many Goths give frighted Science chace, All Empires covet, and would all deface. But as he then his voyage did pursue Proudly, for special Interest, and of few; Or rather did that Ages ills pass by, And would oblige some good Posterity: So I, with pride; to my discovery move, But of a braver world then his could prove; Putting full Trimme, gay Flaggs, and Streamers forth; In hope to find you out for Mindes of worth: Which are so few, that we must add, to raise The Count, such as shall shine in future dayes. And as when Nine unquiet Moones he spent, Yet never saw the Golden Continent; But coasting near the Isles, found that a Tide Of spacious Sea those Islands did divide; Then sayl'd where Salsa, and where Coco-Trees, Are at farr distance seated in the Briez; Then came where swarmes of Cochinella's fly, Whose Blood gives Monarchs Robes their purple dy: Things yet so strange made him incline to boast That touching at those Isles, he trod the Coast Of the vast Land, where Natures walks are free, Her Heards unbounded as her Shoales at Sea; Where her digestions slacken not with cold, For she sits warme by furnaces of Gold. As thus a Voyage long he spent, to gain Those Isles, which are but fragments of the Maine; Yet bless'd his Carde, as if he had possest All Natures great Reserve in the wide West; So I, by length of Progresses, may find The outward parts, or borders of your Mind; Your gracefull temper, soft civility; Formes without which Courts but in Chaos lie; And which the outward signes have ever been Of Greatness safe, and satisfy'd within; Which covets toyling Pow'r for others ease; Not as tis able to offend, but please. The Windes are mine! and to those streams must blow Where your full eloquence does gently flow! I have a Gale shall drive me farther yet To reach the rising prospect of your wit. The Teneriff, ascending to the Sky, Lifts not so sharp a spire, nor mounts so high; Whose Top, farr off, does in dark Clouds appear; But, at approach, that and your wit grow clear. And yet all these, and more and better farr Then these which first we meet, but countless are To those which, being excellently best, Seeme lockt like precious Mines within your breast: The first, are like the Druggs, and like the Fly The Isles afford for Med'cine, and to dy Court-Colours, which must fall to triviall worth, Compar'd to what the Continent brings forth; Whose sacred Gold cures Pow'rs unpitty'd griefe; Giving to Sick and dying States reliefe. The vertues which those Island-Druggs comprise Are slow, and but for common maladies. How great is the distinction, when we find Those heale the Body, this does cure the Mind? And as in these the difference large appears, So 'tis in you, who all our Eyes and Eares Well entertain by your more obvious parts; Your greater and reserv'd oblige our hearts. Yet, as he thought he saw, when he saw shore, All Natures fashions chang'd from what she wore In his own Clime; and that she did appeare So rich, as if her hoord of Mines were there; Then tackt about, and strait grew homeward bound, To see in Seamens Mapps, his Image crown'd; So I, when first your Ornaments I find, Presume a comprehension of your mind; And think that having gon thus farr, I may From further progress other Poets stay: Fixing my Pillers short like Hercules, Who faintly stopt at sight of raging Seas; Or knew not that he there could have a wind By which he might the happy Islands find, And then the western World His Pillers were But monuments of ignorance and feare. How vaine are those who hasty triumphs make When by approach they but the Out-workes take? As if already they had got within, Levell'd the Fort, and fir'd the Magazin. But why does wonder thus ascend to teach Heights which this grov'ling World can never reach? And offer vertues here, as rarities, Where most, even Vice, for being common, prize? In me, it equally uncivill were To boast your Ornaments and Vertues here (Where few have any, Multitudes have none, And most court those who are pretenders grown) As in a Lover it would be to bring A Beauty, fresh, and promising as Spring, There, where her looks might an Assembly vex Of the most proud and wither'd of her Sex; Where they had Lovers too, who with false flame Courted their Dress for beauty, till she came. But 'tis some Justice to ascribe to chance The wrongs you must expect from Ignorance. None can the Moulds of their Creation chuse; We therefore should Mens ignorance excuse, When borne too low to reach at things sublime, 'Tis rather their misfortune then their Crime. As our renown'd Discov'rer triumph made, When, at returne, he did his fraight unlade Of things so strange, that yet they had no name, Which from the nearest Indian Islands came, Though in the Continent he thought they grew, And Merchants wariness he little knew: But quickly mourn'd when he perceiv'd that none Esteem'd rich Merchandise of Druggs unknown; Then, not their want of knowledge did condemne, But found he fail'd, not knowing Trade nor them. So I, if all my coasting-Cards prove true, May bring the nearest Rarities of you; Things of your outward and your hither part, As Limmes seeme Outworkes of the Fort your Heart. I may in haste, like him, vaine Trophys raise For that which others have not skill to praise; Then soon, like him, judiciously may grieve, Not that I bring what few will here receive, But thus their ignorance of you condemne, When I should blame my ignorance of them. You must reverse your Perspective to see Most men at such a cyze as they should be In just esteeme, little and short, for so You shall contract what was but stretcht for shovv: And when you thus their true proportion make, You shall no more undoe them by mistake; But then, by shrinking your large minde, grow fit And usefull to the Stature of their wit. For as our wise Discov'rer (having found How short a Line would all the Bosomes sound Of his wilde Traffiquers) meant when he made, In his next Voyage, tenders of free Trade. With free Mankind to stow what such esteem; Things that might rather please then profit them; Not Silks or Cloth (where Feathers and where Shells Are Ornaments) but pretty Beads and Bells. For who for such wilde Merchants would prepare That which to sober men is solid ware? So you with some wilde men may traffick here; Men of a graver wildness then is there; So solemnly and so austerely mad, As if all Bedlam were in Mourning clad. To these your precious Lading must not come; But when you Trade, consider first with whom: For when to such your temper you dispence, Civilitie, or Wit, or Eloquence, Your Piller-Judgment, which all weight can bear, And Courage, which to shame turns others fear: It shews as if the Muses, in distress, Fled from their Parents, Lords of antient Greece; To marry Goths and Vandals; or it looks Like Trading to Braziel with Grecian Books. How can your graceful temper vallew'd be By those, whose Temper is Stupiditie; Or such a numness is as blowes will bear; And never can be quickn'd but by Fear. Their patience stops them not from doing ill No more then patience makes a Log lie still: For when they cease the excercise of rage, 'Tis not as Reason does our wrath asswage, But as cold Frosts do Torrents quiet keep, Or Wrath is dull'd and pacifi'd by Sleep. True Temper when provokt, does comely grow; And ev'n, when study'd, natural does show: Like that of Socrates, and such as yours, Which, in State-Tempests, gracefully endures The threat'ning Thunder of the great and Loud, The chol'rick, flashes of the Hot and Proud; Yet stands like a Reserve, in all parts clos'd, So far from Rout that 'tis not discompos'd: This is the Temper and must be the Glass, Where Pow'r, to take the World, should dress her Face. What is Civility to those who wear Sterne looks, thinking 'tis grave to look severe? Who even in youth, carry their Wealth and place And Courts lov'd Monster, Bus'ness, in the Face. VVho all the Signs of being civil lack But that they walk in Cities and wear black. Yet think the course thick Flattery, which they First on themselves, then on each other lay, Is all that civil wise Humilitie, VVhich we in Palaces or Temples see: VVhich stills with patient Eares a restless Tongue, Hears the afflicted out, though ever long, Not grieving Sutors when constrain'd to stop The pleasing progress of imprudent Hope: And with such sweet compassion meets Distress As it seems satisfi'd without redress. This is Civility, by Nature yours: And without Art, each crowded Pass secures, Where Sutors long for slow dispatches stay, And to unquiet Thrones would force their way: Bright Thrones, the hardest Seats in Palaces; Where weary Pow'r does never sit at ease. Civility does those with softness gain Whom Armies else by rigour must restrain: Armies, whose civil strength prevents the wrongs Attempted by unarm'd uncivil Throngs: And thus as Pow'r does scatter'd strength collect And Arm, that it from Throngs may Pow'r protect; So should the People that form'd Force esteem, Since from their own fierce rage it rescues them. What is judicious Eloquence to those Whose Speech not up to others reason grows, But climbs aloft to their own passions height; And as our Seamen make no use of sight By any thing observ'd in wide strange Seas, But only of the length of Voyages; Or else, as Men in Races make no stay To draw large Prospects of their breadth of way, So they, in heedless Races of the Tongue, Care not how broad their Theame is but how long. Whilst some of their low level take wise notes, As Germans do of Tales in Passage-Boats: Which to no use, nor aime of pleasure tend But that their length may with the Journey end. And yet they think their Eloquence like that By which you sodainly end long debate, As if in ambush Reason watching lay To charge with a Reserve and get the day. Yours can all Turnes and Counter-turnings find To catch Opinion, as a Ship the winde; Which blowing cross, the Pilot backward steers, And shifting Sayles, makes way when he Laveers. As this is Eloquence so is it yours; Which in the Tongues fierce war, fled Truth secures; And when the Few would to the Many yeild Lifts Reasons Ensignes higher in the Field. How can your Wit please Men so formal grown As they believe it wiser to have none? Or (being born but to a narrow Store, And still in haste, proudly to make it more, By drawing Arts of Empire to their care) Have simply lost their Native little share; Then praise their want of it, and pitty such As they conceive disturb'd by having much. Like Men who having but by fits their Sent (And misapplying Art till all be spent) Seem Natures purpose subt'ly to disdain, In making Smell and of the Sence complain, As oft'ner serv'd with noysome Fumes then Sweet; And some, that fasting Ravens would not meet. Yet those who live contented without VVit, Sin less then when they wear the counterfeit; VVhen VVit in Crafts vild Stamp they currant make; Craft, the most wretched Shape weak Man can take! Slender, and Low; for it through Crowds would pass, By slight, not strength, and would not cumber Place. It hath a little Head, and fill'd with Aire; Small Eies, so matc'd, that they are scarce a pair; Looking with strange and with familiar show, At once on Two whom equally they know. Craft wears this shape, whose bosome Mischief lines, VVith Stuffe as poor as VVitches low designes. And yet they give their Craft the Name of VVit; And weakly think that Pow'r has use of it. Sure when so base a Metal aims to pass For Gold, the very Blind will cry out, Brass! Dares shadow'd Craft assume the shape of VVit, VVhen nought but Light can well resemble it? VVit flies beyond the limits of that Law, By which our Sculptors grave, or Painters draw, And Statuaries up to Nature grow; VVho all their strokes of Life to Poets owe. Their Art can make no shape for Wit to wear; It is divine and can no Image bear. None by description can that Soul express; Yet all must the effects of it confess: States boast of those effects when they relate, How they in Treaties foyl'd a duller State. And VVarriours, shewing how they gain'd the Day, How they drew up, and where there ambush lay: And Lovers, telling, why a Rival fail'd, VVhilst they but whisp'red Beauty and prevail'd. And Cloyster'd men, when they with smiles declare How rigidly they are confin'd from care, And how they let the world plough troubled Seas, VVhilst they for pennance must endure their ease. Reason grown bold, because her strength she knows; VVhich, when with growth enlarg'd, more active grows; VVhich like a Ship of VVar, well ballasted, Does with her Ballasts weight augment her speed; Which does such quickness in her strength comprise, That she to action does together rise A standing Army and a running Force; As apt to move with Canon as with Horse; Then in small strengths divides and marches far, Where Northern Ignorance makes Winter-war; Yet her Retreat bravely at last secures: Reason, like this, is Wit; and such is yours: Whose Game is Chess, in which all chief degrees Of Empire move, and by your hand, with ease. Who quickly those coherent Forces spy, That march about, to steal a Victory; And whilst the Wit that guides the adverse hand Proceeds but slowly, or does make a stand, Yours in a moment ends the long debate; And, with one check, prevents and gives the Mate. How can your Judgment, as profound as Seas, Be lik'd by those whom feares of depth displease? That so of deeper knowledge are affraid, As Women are with depths of Seas dismay'd; Who rather trust those Rivers where they may, Still see the dreaded bottom of their way: Whilst more experienc'd seamen Shallows shun, And hoyst all Sailes, where deeper Channels run. But as the Spaniards (whom meer wind and chance Did Westward lead, and to wilde Thrones advance) Thought to walk on with Empire till they came, Where the declining Sun does quench his Flame, Till they did reach the utmost bounds of Light, And saw him steal into the Bed of Night: Then thought, they could that spacious Empire sway, Whilst lazily, they stretcht in Arbours lay. Yet soon (unable grown to manage more Then what, with ease, grew subject to their Pow'r) They checkt each Pilot that would farther go, And seem'd suffic'd with what they first did know; Least yielding to know more, their knowledge might To others walks become a happy Light. So when Opinion (that outragious winde, Which swells and drives the Peoples sailing Minde; And when fantastick chance, which does it steer) Had brought these in, to rule wilde Empire here, They thought to sit at everlasting ease In Clouds; and there from Ayrie Palaces, Drop fruitful showres of Edicts over all, Softly as snow that does in Feathers fall; But as cold Snow, when it awhile is felt, Does heat that hand that after does it melt; So they, though cool at first, did quickly draw Forth heat, that did their Pow'r as quickly thaw. Then finding they lackt knowledge to discharge, That sway which first they purpos'd to inlarge, They poorly meant this Empire to contract, Less'ning their Stage where few were fit to act: Treating all those, as Strangers and as Spies, That boldly durst adventure to be wise: Proudly confining others knowledge by Bounds of their own confin'd capacity. Sure they did think abundant knowledge, Vice; And thought, it was so held in Paradise. Man there was fin'd for that proud Ignorance Which would his thoughts to reachless heights advance. In this the diff'rence does apparent grow; Man cannot God, nor his high secrets know: Of him, and his wak'd Reason can but dream; But you asleep may find out theirs and them. Could they so young and new of judgment be To think the glorious Robe, Authority, Which they patcht up by many hands in haste, Then wore all day and night, could ever last? Wore in all Weathers, and in ev'ry Throng; Whilst it through haste was often put on wrong; Not us'd as onely for Solemnity, For order shewn awhile, and then lay'd by: But so, as some would by a careless Dress, Great scorn of little outward things express: So oft they wore it, that it could not more Be seen, if at the publick Senate Dore It had hung out, and there a Sign had bin, Of some strange innate Pow'r that lodg'd within. And in this Robe of Pow'r they did despise, Gay colours which allure the Peoples Eies, As if through sullenness, or by mistake Of Empires fashions, they had dy'd it black. Well might we think Pow'r was in Mourning clad, When all took care to keep the People sad; Silenc'd their pleasant Schole, the Theatre, (Which taught them men) not that they could not there The sorrows of the Tragick Scene permit, But that those sorrows were but counterfeit. They banisht Musick too, because the sad And thoughtful it preserv'd from being Mad: For Madness then was in a high esteem, Allow'd in all, and reverenc'd in them. Nature (which is, though dimm, the only Glass, Where all a little see the Godheads face That walk with open Eies) was hardly free, From being chid for too much levitie, Because her feather'd Quire but vainly sing, When she does usher in the gaudy Spring. They thought their painted Plumes ill patterns here, By which our Lovers vary what they weare. Whilst all her Flowers that do our Meades adorne Seem but her Ribbands and for fancy worne. If Judgment could in solemn dulness lie, (Which weaker Rulers wear for gravity) Then those must needs transcendent judgments have, That would instruct wise Nature to be grave. A well establisht Judgment, such as yours By perfect strength as certainly secures The aimes of Pow'r as what she does possess; And Empire ever must intend increase: Empire, the Tyde of restless Greatnesses, Shov'd on at Land as Rivers are from Seas; Which at no mark can any moment stay, But when it cannot rise must ebb away. And as your judgment can so greatly do, Preserve possession and inlarge it too, So can it boldly to great works proceed, Without those shifts which weaker judgments need: In its known forces safe, as Armies are, Whose Fame, before the Battail, ends the War. Not spreading Files to cover spacious Ground, Whilst many Drums beat loud, and Trumpets sound; Whilst many feigned Ensignes all the day Their glorious Colours to the Foe display; Yet basely cautious, all at night lie close, Arm'd and entrencht in a contracted Grose. Haste cannot make your judgment run astray, Nor follow Pow'r, through shades, the nearest way. You walk, though far about, through open Plaines, Till Pow'r the high o'relooking Station gaines: Whose lofty Top must often cloudy show; For Hills, by staying Clouds, clear all below. Your Judgment with those Arts of Thrones is mov'd Which whilst they heighten Pow'r, can make it lov'd: When publick glories, and gay Triumphs ease Strain'd Thought, and the diverted People please: Who when they see Courts thoughtful, think they fear: And such suspition Empire cannot bear. 'Tis ill when Subjects are by Pow'r dismay'd; Worse, when they fear that Rulers are affraid. Should prosp'rous Courts, to make them still appear Solemn and serious, alwise Mourning wear? As if by blacks they could the credit have, To be believ'd misterious, stayd and grave? Or secret and discreet by being sad? VVhen Martial Courts are like the Papal clad, Then let the conqu'ring Troops turn Clergy too, Unarme, and preach subjection to the Foe: Let ev'ry Subject the lov'd Drama shun, (To which our pleasant Ancestors did run) And growing serious, serve seven Years the State, Be first their Prentice, then a Magistrate. VVhat object can your Courage be, when shown, To those who have a prowder of their own? VVho the civility of Honour hate, Because they fear it is effeminate? They think, that sullen rudeness is a grace; And Conquest is less brave then to deface: And that deform'd Destructions are the fair And well proportion'd Images of VVar: They civil Government enough detest Because 'tis by that Epithet exprest: But with exceeding reason much abhor, Those that command the strengths of civil Pow'r; As Cannibals have cause to take it ill, From Men who rescue those whom they would kill; Men civil held when they forbid that Meat, VVhich better Stomacks then themselves would eat. All that by courage daring Rome or Greece Have done, these have outdone by boyst'rousness: Whose Rage durst break (breaking the Muses hearts) The ancient League between all Arms and Arts. The Muses Regents were in Greece and Rome: In all the civil world they were at home. No Chief could think his battail highly fought Till won again by being higher wrought. And here they us'd in Palaces to dwell Till these rose up, and they and Empire fell. These, who obscure confusion love, blinde chance, And their great Guide, though blinder, Ignorance. But since the most important Things (which are Empire and Arts) require Heav'ns special care: Because they still with difficulty grow, And are, in progress to perfection slow: Or else because both use to Spring and rise, Where still their growth is watcht by Enemies: Heav'n therefore hath the League and Union made, Which strikes at all that either would invade. The Muses must (where fate in Empires lies) With Empire fall, as they with Empire rise. That Courage which the vain for Valor take (Who proudly danger seek for Glory's sake) Is impudence; and what they rashly do, Has no excuse, but that 'tis madness too. Yet when confin'd, it reaches Valors name; Which seeks fair Vertue and is met by Fame. It weighs the cause ere it attempts the Fact; And bravely dares forbear as well as act. It would reclaim much rather then subdue; And would the Chacers not the Chac'd pursue: Would rather hide success then seek applause: And though of strength secur'd, yet trusts the cause. And all the aid of strength it measures too, Not by the acts it did, or still can do; But passively, by what it well endures: This noble Valor is, and this is yours. And this the Foe, with praises, did esteem; Raising your deeds when ruinous to them: When Makroom chang'd the colour of her Flood, And deeply blusht with staines of Rebels Blood: When Corks prowd River did her flowing stay And, frighted, gave the ebb of Makroom way: VVhich from her Stream did pale, as Christal, flow, But in her ebb, as red as Corral show. And though designes, the seed of Action, may In colder grounds of Courts for springing stay, And lie conceal'd awhile, and often waite The Seasons and fair weathers of the State, Yet in the Fields of War, Chiefs sow in haste, They quicken growth, and reap their Harvest fast: So to your ready valour Fate did add, More Wings then Fame after the Batail had. When o're the Rivers Banks you seem'd to pass At once to charge, to vanquish and to chace. Your Foes brought Fear, but Fear lackt VVings for speed; For though in former Fields she swiftly-fled As Love advancing, or departing Light, Yet now she stood, and they did stay to fight: As if, by your ador'd Example taught, They seem'd to feel that valor which you brought. But great examples keep some excellence VVhich others cannot take nor they dispence: As secretly, Originals express, Some touches, comings out, and boldnesses VVhich Copies steal but by a weaker hand, And credit lose, when long they near them stand. And though a while, to be compar'd they stay; Yet soon they are disgrac'd and ta'ne away, So all the Adverse Chiefs (whose hasty fate Advanc'd their Troops, your deeds to imitate) No longer held comparing but to yield: They found your valor, and they lost the Field. VVhen Fame to watchful Rome your conquest brought (For Fame still-hovr'd o're you when you fought) The Conclave calmly did their VVrath disguise, VVhose Pow'r by patience not by threats did rise: But when they heard their Miter'd Chief did dy, Punish'd with shame for shameful cruelty, They blusht more at themselves then at his doome; VVho reap'd in Ireland what they sow'd in Rome. Now as our great Columbus honor sought From what he left behind not what he brought: From Gold and radiant Stones; which he did prize Above his Drugs, or purple Die of Flies: From Hoords which lay reserv'd that they might be Rewards to crown his second industrie; So I shall patiently expect my best Renown from rich Reserves within your Breast: VVhen next I shall Imbark with a full Gale, Be evener ballasted and bear more Sayl; VVhen all the Muses (pittying much to find, At Helme my weakness in my late cross VVind) Shall on my Decks like Mariners appear; And strive to trim my Yards and help to steer. Yet as at last he wisely jealous grew That some, (who well in his late Voyage knew The Course he bore) might shortly ply the same, And then like Rivals share his Hopes and Fame. So I with juster avarice, may fear Least others (watchful of the Course I steer) May through ambition second my address, Correct my Scheme, and Sayl, with more success. And this may be a pardon'd jealousie, Because it then looks out with Reasons Eye VVhen just despaires by known defects are mov'd, And merit cannot match the thing belov'd. But there is right to first plantation due, And by that Title I lay claime to you. To him who Prophecy'd a Succesles end of the Parliament, in the Year 1630. Frantick and foolish too! can any curse, Which dying Men still give thee make thee worse? Madmen sometimes on suddain flashes hit Of Sence, which seem remote, and sound like Wit. But thou, most piteously, art Madd and Dull: Thy Braines did ly in parcels in thy Skull; Then with a fright together clung, and lay Like Curds, but now are melted into Whay. Froward with Age, thou seem'st more hum'rous than A begger'd Chymist, or rich Curtizan: Thou strikst at publick peace, whilst thy chief care, Has ever been to hide thy self in War. And through defect of Courage dost present, Thy false fear to the fearless Parliament, Like him whose Quæries did some few distract; Who were too wise to suffer, and too tame to act. Keep in a Cage thy ever flying Fear; Which Nests would build in ev'ry open Eare, Or find out Men whose needless care contrives, New slender paths through narrow Perspectives; Where jealous sight draws smallest things from far, To make them seem much greater than they are. These Men would from the Bosome of the State Chase Truth, or there distract her with debate. Canst thou believe, who dost a Storm foretell, That it will come because thy passions swell? The causes of a Storm thou dost mistake, And only blow'st to make thine own cheecks ake. He who esteems thy Northern Prophesie, Does but encourage Fools to learn to lie. Swet out thy Blood! in a hot Feaver vext, By striving to interpret this dark Text. Thou great Informer, canst thou hope I wou'd, By dang'rous thee, be plainly understood; Whom all, through all thy State disguises know; Towards thee, Satyrick numbers must not flow, Like Lovers Sonnets, in a soft smooth pace, They must be rugged as thy Mistress face. Whom with false prayses thou hast long bely'd. I mount like Perseus when he did bestride The Poets prancing Horse; who ambled not, But roughly mov'd in this Majestick Trot. Why should this Wisard make with Prophecies, The People fearful and their Rulers Wise? Must all, like Ethnicks to this Divel bow? Great Senate know, I am your Prophet now. Since you may warm you at my Delphick flame, Dismiss this common Messenger of Fame. My Mistick art, with joy already findes, The noble purpose of your mighty mindes. You have of Monarchs wants a tender sence, Meaning to shorten your Lov'd Eloquence; And not the fulness of your Loves express, By mourning for your Purses emptiness. When Thrones are rich, the People richer grow; As Rivers gain by Seas to which they flow. And this the People quickly would believe, But that their Oratours must them deceive: Who Pyramids of Wit by talking raise; Which last as seldom as the Peoples praise. For though by help of ev'ry vulgar hand, These Piles rise fast, yet they are made of Sand. Look up! You Sons of mighty Ancestors! Who never bownded were by their own shores. Your fighting Fathers were abroad renown'd; Their Kings in France, and distant Jewry crown'd. See o're your Heads the Western Eagle fly; First towring up, then compassing the Sky. Unless our Royal Falcon strait prepare, To struggle with him in his Native Ayre, He will inlarge his growth, new imp his VVings; And make the Hague an Hospital for Kings. The Countess of ANGLESEY lead Captive by the Rebels, at the Disforresting of Pewsam. SONG. 1 O vvhither will you lead the Fair, And spicy Daughter of the Morne? Those Manacles of her soft Haire, Princes, though free, would faine have worn. 2 VVhat is her crime? what has she done? Did she, by breaking Beauty stay, Or from his Course mislead the Sun; So robb'd your Harvest of a Day? 3 Or did her voyce, divinely clear! (Since lately in your Forrest bred) Make all the Trees dance after her, And so your VVoods disforrested? 4 Run, Run! Pursue this Gothick Rout, VVho rudely Love in bondage keep; Sure all old Lovers have the Goute, The young are overwatcht and sleep. The long Vacation in London, in Verse Burlesque, or Mock-Verse. Now Town-Wit sayes to witty Friend, Transcribe apace all thou hast pend; For I, in Journey hold it fit, To cry thee up to Countrey-Wit. Our Mules are come! dissolve the Club! The word, till Term, is rub, O rub! Now Gamster poor, in Cloak of Stammel, Mounted on Steed, as slow as Cammel, Battoone of Crab in luckless hand, (Which serves for Bilboe and for Wand) Early In Morne does sneak from Town, Least Landlords wife should seise on Crown; On Crown which he in Pouch does keep, When day is done to pay for sleep; For he in Journey nought does eat. Host spies him come, cryes, Sir, what Meat? He calls for Room, and down he lies Quoth Host, no Supper Sir? he cryes, I eate no Supper, fling on Rug! I'm sick, d'you hear, yet bring a Jug! Now Damsel young that dwels in Cheap: For very joy begins to leap, Her Elbow small she oft does rub; Tickled with hope of Sillabub! For Mother (who does Gold maintain On Thumbe, and Keys in Silver Chaine) In Snow White Clout, wrapt nook of Pye, Fat Capons Wing, and Rabbets Thigh, And said to Hackney Coachman, go, Take Shillings six, say I, or no, Whither says he? Quoth she, thy Teame, Shall drive to place where groweth Creame. But Husband gray now comes so Stall, For Prentice notch'd he strait does call: Where's Dame quoth he, quoth Son of Shop, She's gone her Cake in Milk to Sop: Ho, ho! to Islington; enough! Fetch Job my son, and our Dog Ruffe! For there in Pond, through Mire and Muck, We'l cry, hay Duck, there Ruffe, hay Duck! Now Turnbal-Dame by starving Paunch, Bates Two Stone Weight in either Haunch: On Branne and Liver she must Dine; And sits at Dore instead of Signe. She softly says to roaring-Swash, Who wears long Whiskers, go, fetch Cash! There's Gown quoth she, speak Broaker fair, Till Term brings up weak Countrey Heir: Whom Kirtle red will much amaze; Whilst Clown his Man on Signes does gaze, In Liv'ry short, Galloome on Cape, With Cloak-Bag Mounting high as Nape. Now Man that trusts, with weary Thighs, Seeks Garret where small Poet lies: He comes to Lane, finds Garret shut; Then not with Knuckle, but with foot He rudely thrusts, would enter Dores; Though Poet sleeps not, yet he snores: Cit chafes like beast of Libia then; Sweares, he'l not come or send agen. From little Lump triangular Poor Poets sighes, are heard afar. Quoth he, do noble Numbers chuse To walk on feet; that have no shoose? Then he does wish with fervent breath, And as his last request ere Death, Each Ode a Bond, each Madrigal, A Lease from Haberdashers Hall, Or that he had protected bin At Court, in List of Chamberlain; For Wights near Thrones care not an Ace, For Woodstreet Friend that wieldeth Mace. Courts pay no Scores but when they List, And Treasurer still has Cramp in Fist; Then forth he steales; to Globe does run; And smiles, and vowes Four Acts are done: Finis to bring he does protest, Tells ev'ry Play'r, his part is best. And all to get, (as Poets use) Some Coyne in Pouche to solace Muse. Now Wight that acts on Stage of Bull, In Skullers bark does lie at Hull; Which he for pennies two does Rig, All day on Thames to bob for Grig: Whilst Fencer poor does by him stand, In old Dung-Lighter, Hook in hand; Between knees rod, with Canvas Crib, To girdle Tide, close under Rib; Where Worms are put which must small Fish Betray at Night to Earthern Dish. Now London's Chief, on Sadle new, Rides into Fare of Bartholemew: He twirles his Chain, and looketh big, As if to fright the Head of Pig, That gaping lies on greasy Stall, Till Female with great Belly call. Now Alderman in field does stand, With foot on Trig, a Quoit in hand; I'm seaven quoth he, the Game is up! Nothing I pay, and yet I sup. To Alderman, quoth Neighbour then, I lost but Mutton, play for Hen: But wealthy Blade cryes out; at Rate Of Kings, should'st play; lets go, tis late. Now lean Atturney, that his Cheese Ne'r par'd, nor Verses took for Fees; And aged Proctor, that controules, The feats of Punck in Court of Pauls; Do each with solemn Oath agree, To meet in Fields of Finsbury: With Loynes in Canvas Bow case tyde; Where Arrows stick with mickle pride; With Hats pinn'd up, and Bow in hand, All day most fiercely there they stand; Like Ghosts of Adam, Bell, and Clymme: Sol sets for fear they'l shoot at him. Now Spynie, Ralph, and Gregorie small, And short hayr'd Stephen, Whay-fac'd Paul, (Whose times are out, Indentures torn) Who seaven long years did never skorne, To fetch up Coales for Maid to use, Wipe Mistresses, and Childrens Shooes) Do jump for joy they are made free; Hire meagre Steeds, to ride and see, Their Parents old who dwell as near, As Place call'd Peake in Derby-shire. There they alight, old Croanes are milde; Each weeps on Cragg of pretty Childe: They portions give, Trades up to set, That babes may live, serve God and cheat. Near House of Law by Temple-Bar, Now man of Mace cares not how far, In Stockings Blew he marcheth on, With Velvet Cape his Cloack upon; In Girdle, Scrowles, where names of some, Are written down, whom touch of Thumbe, On Shoulder left must safe convoy, Anoying Wights with name of Roy. Poor Pris'ners friend that sees the touch, Cries out, aloud, I thought as much. Now Vaulter good, and dancing Lass, On Rope, and Man that cryes hey pass, And Tumbler young that needs but stoop, Lay head to heel to creep through Hoope; And Man in Chimney hid to dress, Puppit that acts our old Queen Bess, And Man that whilst the Puppits play, Through Nose expoundeth what they say: And Man that does in Chest include, Old Sodom and Gomorrah lewd: And white Oate-eater that does dwell; In Stable small at Sign of Bell: That lift up hoofe to show the prancks, Taught by Magitian, stiled Banks; And Ape, led Captive still in Chaine, Till he renounce the Pope and Spaine. All these on hoof now trudge from Town, To cheat poor Turnep-eating Clown. Now Man of War with Visage red, Growes Chollerick and sweares for Bread. He sendeth Note to Man of Kin, But man leaves word, I'm not within. He meets in Street with friend call'd Will; And cryes old Rogue! what living still? But er' that Street they quite are past, He softly asks, what Money hast? Quoth friend, a Crown; he cryes, dear heart! O base, no more, Sweet, lend me part! But stay my frighted Pen is fled; My self through fear creep under Bed; For just as Muse would scribble more, Fierce City Dunne did rap at Door. EPITAPH. When you perceive these Stones are wet, Think not you see the Marble Swet; It weeps for grief the day of Doom, (Invok'd by Saints) will shortly come; Then the unwilling Marble must, Surrender all this Saints sweet Dust. Song. The Winter Storms. 1 Blow! blow! The Winds are so hoarse they cannot blow. Cold, cold! our Teares freeze to Hail, our Spitle to Snow! The Waves are all up, they swel as they run! Let them rise and rise, As high as the skies, And higher to wash the face of the Sun. 2 Port, Port! the Pilot is blinde! Port at the Helm! Yare, yare! For one foot of shore take a whole Realm, Alee, or we sink! Does no man know to wind he?r? Less noyse and more room! We sayl in a Drumme! Our Sayles are but Wraggs, which Light'ning turns to Tinder. 3 Aloof, aloof! Hey, how those Carracks and Ships, Fall foul and are tumbled and driven like Chips? Our Boatsen, alass, a silly weak Grisle, For fear to catch cold, Lies down in the Hould, We all hear his Sighs, but few hear his Whistle. Upon the Marriage of the Lady Jane Cavendish with Mr. Cheney. 1. Why from my thoughts, sweet rest; sweeter to me, Then young Ambition's prosp'rous Travails be, Or Love's delicious progresses; And is next Death the greatest ease? VVhy from so calme a Heav'n, Dost call me to this VVorld, all windy grown; VVhere the light Crowd, like lightest Sand is driven, And weighty greatness, even by them, to Air is blown? To the Duke of Richmond, in the Year 1639. My Lord, The Court does seem a Ship, where all are still, Busie by office, or imploy'd for skill; And active grow through stirring hope or fear: For Courts breed stormes, and stormes are lasting there. VVhere he that feeds a wild ambitious spirit, And nourishes desires above his merit, Is lost when he imagines to prevail; Because his little ship bears too much sayl: VVhilst cunning Statesmen (safe from envious checks) Move carelesly, as Seamen walk on Decks; VVearing their faces often to the VVest, VVhen bownd and sayling to the rising East. And in the Court, as in a Ship we find, That in some factious sodain VVar of VVind, The very Ballast we were poized by, (VVeighty Discretion and Integrity, The helps which Time and Nature best afford) VVe for our safety, oft throw over-Board. And, as in Ships, so when the Storm grows high At Court, we oft on Couz'ning Hope rely; Our Anchor in uncertain Quick-Sands cast, VVhere wanting steady hold to make it fast, The Anchor Hope (alas) we vainly spend, Like men expos'd to trust a faithless friend. Informers are the Pumps, which useful grow, By voyding ills that secretly o'reflow; On whose distastful mischiefs Pow'r must wink, And still endure them active though they stink. And, as in Ships, so in a Palace all, Proceed by Aids that are collateral. The way to highest Pow'r is still oblique; VVhich when we strive to move, we, Seamen-like, Must hand a lesser string, untill it stir A distant Cord which does our force prefer, Whilst Money, like the Boatsens whistle, calls, Each helper till through haste most hazard falls. But this great Ship, the Court, takes dayly in Poor Traficquers who with small Stocks begin: They Trade with Fortune, and her false VVares buy: One of this slight neglected Crowd am I. My little venture I saw safely stow'd: Both VVind and Tyde serv'd outward from the Road; But making way, and bearing ev'ry Sayle, Proudly as if I still could chuse my Gale; Strait I beheld (amaz'd as with a wrack) The sheets all rumpled and the Cordage slack; Sure some perverse and undiscover'd hand, Pulls an odd Rope that by oblique Command, Doth straine another, till by secret skill, It makes a turning or a standing still. But you, my noble Lord, (who sit so near The busie Helm, and wisely help to steer) Must be my princely Pilot, and you may, Reform the ship till she can ride her way. If then my Voyage prosper (though I am Now hardly grown to bear a Factors name) Yet who dares boldly doubt that I shall be, In time a mighty Burgher of the Sea. My Bark may Multiply, and grow a Fleet, And I lay yearly Customs at your Feet. To Mr, W. M. Against Absence. Pedler in Love! thou with the common Art, Of Trafickers dost fly from Mart to Mart, Thinking thy passions (false as their false Ware) Will, if not here, vent in another Fare. As if thy subtile threat'ning to remove, From hence could raise the price of thy poor Love. Thou knowst, the Deer being shot, the Hunter may, Securely trust him though he run away; For flying with his Wound the Arrow more, Does gall and vex him then it did before. Absence from her you Love (that Love being true) Is a thin Cloud between the Sun and you; It does not take the object from your Eye, But rather makes you abler to descry. Then know my wandring weake Philosopher, You vainly take the paines to fly from her, On whom in absence you must ever think, For 'tis a kind of seeing when you winke. A New-years-Gift to the Queen, in the Year 1643. 1 Madam, 'tis fit I now make even My numerous accompts with Heaven, Least all my old years crimes, if unforgiven, Should still stand charg'd upon the new: And, since Confession makes them less, My greater Crimes I will confess, Which are, my Praises writ of you. 2 Not that 'tis likely I can be Prophane in such a high degree, To think those Praises are Idolatrie; But I implore my sorrows may Excuse me from those torments due For my attempts of praising you The Poets dull and common way. 3 First, I confess I did you wrong, When rashly in each Lyrick Song, I said, your Native Beauty did belong Unto some Planet of the Night: As if I fondly could surmise You had such weak and needy Eyes, As borrow'd to maintain their light. 4 Next, I confess, with sighs and teares, That to unknown harmonious Spheares Or to the feather'd Eastern Quiristers I likned you when you did sing; Your sweetness, unto Buds and Flowers When dews of May or April showers Begin, or consummate the Spring. 5 Be mercifull; and think not on The course injustice I have done By either dull and false comparison: Why should we liken you to ought We take on trust for Excellence; Or what doth please the Peoples sence, Or what by rasher Fame is taught. 6 With greater safety we may dare Resemble you to what you are; And fitly yours unto your own compare, For when you sing, then we should say This Musick now doth charme the Eare, Just like that Musick we did heare From your own voice the other day. 7 And when you breathe, we need not bring So many Flowers, as in the Spring Would beautifie an Ethnick offering, To shew or similize you more: It were much wiser to declare, This odour so perfumes the Ayre As that when you pass'd by before. 8 But oh! How can I hope for rest? Conscience, which to anothers breast Comes but in visit, as a hasty Guest, Not only dwells but rules in me; As if my groanes must ever last; Because I said that you are chast Like bashful cold Euridice. 9 Sure he that in his wits distress Does trust a Fable to express Your worth, takes silly paines to make it less. Those who compare your Chastity Must cautious grow, and only sweare You are but like to what you were, When in your blooming Infancy. 10 Madam, since now I have made even My numerous accompts with Heaven, I boldly may expect to be forgiven; For when I liken or Commend Each single vertue with the rest That strive for higher place within your Breast, I find your Mercy does transcend. To the QUEEN; Entertain'd at Night. In the Year 1644. 1 Unhappy Excellence, What make you here? Had you had sin enough to be afraid, Or we the vertue not to cause that feare, You had not hither come to be betray'd. 2 But since you come, and bring so rich a store Of Native Ornament and Inward wealth, Do not expect to goe, and leave us poore; For we must share of both, by force or stealth. 3 Tis not enough, though from each excellence You furnish us that here expecting stand: We must divide your vertues, and dispence Them, as a bounty, through this needy Land. 4 In necessary haste, your Charity Shall unto great suspitious Wits be given; But timely, ere they breathe their last, to try If, without Faith, they can arrive at Heaven. 5 Unto the Clergy, your Humility; Till like the old Apostles they appeare, Who serv'd, (had they not lik'd their low degree) One that could make them greater then they were. 6 On Judges, your compassion we bestow; To make them, when they punish, less severe; For poor disdain'd Invaders valiant grow VVhen rigid Lawes make wealthy Cowards here. 7 To Citizens, your Bounty; who believe They for long Couz'ning dearly satisfie, If to appease new Kings, they Pageants give, And sweeten Heaven with Almes when they must die. 8 Your truth, we offer to the Politick, VVho, with new Crutches, would support the Lawes; Excusing publick Ayds with an old Trick Of wanting conscience to approve the cause. 9 Your patience, now our Drums are silent grown; VVe give to Souldiers, who in fury are, To find the profit of their Trade is gone, And Lawyers still grow rich by Civil VVarr. 10 Your Chastity to all, that so we may Safely without affronts to publick peace, Perform the Zealots part a calmer way; VVhilst vertue makes the high Commission cease. 11 To seeming Statesmen we design your wit; For wanting wit they gravely wit despise. But when by having yours they value it, They need no power nor wealth to make them wise. 12 Your Beauty, to your Ladies we decree, Yet, since each soon would quarrel for her share, VVe only think it safe in Majesty, And they more safe from Envy, as they are. 13 Your bashfulness shall freely be allow'd To Northern Suters who besiege the Throne: For Princes look like Prisoners in that Croud, VVhere most by impudence not worth are known. 14 Your voice (our Musick when you speak) we give To those who teach the Mysteries above, That their perswasions we may soon believe; For Doctrines thrive when we our Teachers love. 15 Your heart, to those who swore the Covenant; And though this Gift to them seem strange to you, Yet such a heart as yours they only want, To make them loving to their King and true. 16 Now of these Vertues you have rifled been, And so much Ornament is sent away; How (Madam) do you feel your self within? The Sun and you can ne'r deprive Your selves by what you others give: You both keep Light by motion from decay. 17 Think not these Vertues lost but stept aside; Then long you need not for their absence mourne, Such Guests cannot in Clayie sheds abide, But to their Christall-Court will soon returne. To the QUEEN. Madam; so much peculiar, and alone Are Kings, so uncompanion'd in a Throne: That through the want of some equality (Familiar Guides, who lead them to comply) They may offend by being so sublime; As if to be a King might be a crime; All less then Kings no more with Kings prevaile Then lesser Weights with greater in a Scale: They are not mov'd (when weigh'd within a Throne) But by a greatness equall to their own. To cure this high obnoxious singleness (Yet not to make their power but danger less) Were Queenes ordain'd; who were in Monarchs breasts Tenants for life, not accidental Guests; So they prevaile by Nature, not by chance; But you (with yours) your vertue does advance; When you perswade him (in the Peoples cause) Not to esteeme his Judges more then Laws. In Kings (perhaps) extreame obdurateness Is as in Jewels hardness in excess: Which makes their price: for we as well call stones For hardness as for brightness, Paragones: And 'tis perhaps so with obdurate Kings As with the best impenitrable things. No way to pierce or alter them is found, Till we to Di'monds use a Diamond. So you to him, who, to new-forme his Crown, Would bring no aides less precious then his own: Others have prov'd to be convenient things To find the sodain'st way to ruine Kings, Whilst you (whose vertues make your Councells thrive) Look't on that mystick word, Prerogative, As if you saw long-hid uncurrant Gold; Which must (though it prove good) be try'd Because it long has laine aside; And rather too, because the Stamp is old: Which in the Mettals triall some deface, Whilst you by polishing would make it pass. When you have wrought it to a yieldingness That shews it fine but makes it not weigh less. Accurst are those Court-Sophisters who say When Princes yield, Subjects no more obey. Madam, you that studied Heaven and Times Know there is Punishment, and there are Crimes. You are become (which doth augment your state) The Judges Judge, and Peoples Advocate: These are your Triumphs which (perhaps) may be (Yet Triumphs have been tax'd for Cruelty) Esteem'd both just and mercifully good: Though what you gain with Tears, cost others Blood. PROLOGUE, To the unfortunate Lovers. VVere you but halfe so humble to confess, As you are Wise, to know your Happiness; Our Author would not grieve to see you sit Ruling with such unquestion'd pow'r his Wit: How happy were I, could I still retain My Loyalty to him, yet fairly gain Your kind opinion by revealing now The cause of that great Storm which clouds his Brow, And his close murmurs, which since meant to you, I cannot think, or mannerly, or true? Well; I begin to be resolv'd, and let My melancholly Tragick Monsieur fret; Let him the several harmless weapons use Of that all-daring trifle, call'd his Muse; Yet I'le inform you what this very day Twice before witness, I have heard him say; Which is, that you are grown excessive proud; Since ten times more of Wit then was allow'd, Your silly Ancestors in twenty year, You think, in two short hours to swallow here. For they to Theaters were pleas'd to come, E're they had din'd, to take up the best Room: There sit on Benches not adorn'd with Mats, And graciously did vail their high-crown'd Hats To every halfe-dress'd Player, as he still Through Hangings peep'd to see the Gall'ries fill. Good easie judging Souls, with what delight They would expect a Jigg or Target-Fight, A furious Tale of Troy which they ne'r thought Was weakly Writ, if it were strongly Fought: Laught at a Clinch, the shadow of a Jest, And cry'd, A passing good one I protest! Such dull and humble-witted People were Even your Forefathers, whom we govern'd here: And such had you been too, he swears, had not The Poets taught you to unweave a Plot. To trace the winding-Scenes, and to admit What was true Sense, not what did sound like Wit. They arm'd you thus, against themselves to fight, Made strong and mischievous from what they write: You have been lately highly feasted here: With two great Wits who grac'd our Theatre: But, if to feed you, often with delight, Will more corrupt then mend your appetite; He vows to use you, which he much abhors, As others did, your homely Ancestors. EPILOGUE. [Our Poet in his fury hath profest] Our Poet in his fury hath profest, Yet gravely, with his Hand upon his Breast, That he will never wish to see us thrive, If by an humble Epilogue we strive To court from you that priviledge to day Which you so long have had to damme a Play; 'Las, Gentlemen, he knows, to cry Plays down Is half the business Termers have in Town; And still the reputation of their Wit grows strong; As they can first condemn, though right or wrong. Your Wives and Countrey-friends may Power exact To find a fault or two in every Act: But you, by his consent, most kindly shall Enjoy the priviledge to rail at all: A happy freedom, which you love no less Then Money, Health, good Wine, or Mistresses; And he, he hopes (when Age declines his Wit From this our Stage, to sit and rule the Pit) Shall cruelly assume a Charter firme. As yours, to kill a Poet ev'ry Term. And though he never had the confidence, To tax your judgment in his own defence, Yet the next night, when you your Money share, He'l shrewdly guess what your opinions are. PROLOGUE, To the WITS. Bless me you kinder Starrs! How are we throng'd? Alass! whom hath our harmless Poet wrong'd, That he should meet together in one day A Session, and a Faction at his Play, To judge, and to condemne? It cannot be Amongst so many here, all should agree. Your expectation too, you so much raise As if you came to wonder, not to praise. And this Sir-Poet (if I e're have read Customes, or Men) strikes you, and your Muse dead! Conceive now too, how much, how oft each Ear Hath surfeited in this our Hemisphear, With various, pure, eternal Wit; add then Young Comick-Sir, you must be kill'd agen. But, to out-doe these miseries a sort Of cruel spies (we hear) intend a sport Among themselves; our mirth must not at all Tickle, or stirre their Lungs, but shake their Gall. So this, joyn'd with the rest, makes me agin To say, you and your Lady Muse within Will have but a sad doom; and your trim Brow Which long'd for Wreaths, you must wear naked now; Unless some here, out of a courteous pride, Resolve to praise what others shall decide. So they will have their humour too; and we, More out of dulness then Civility, Grow highly pleas'd with our success to night, By thinking both, perhaps, are in the right. Such is your pleasant judgements upon Plays, Like Par'lels that run straight, though sev'ral ways. EPILOGUE. [The bus'nes of this Epilogue, is now] The bus'nes of this Epilogue, is now To smooth and stroke the wrinkles from each brow; To guide severer Judgments (if we cou'd Be wise enough) untill they thought all good Which they perhaps dislike; and sure, this were An over-boldness, rais'd from too much fear. You have a freedom: which you now may use, To raise our youthful Poet and his Muse With a kind doom; who will tread boldly then, In newer Comick-Socks, this Stage agen. EPITAPH On Mrs. Katherine Cross buried in France. Within this hallow'd Ground this Seed is sown Of such a Flow'r (though faln e're fully blown) As will when Doom, the Saints first spring, appears Be sweet as those which Heavens choice Bosom wears. Sweeter in wither'd death then fresh Flow'rs are; And through Deaths foul, and frightful vizard fair: As calm in Life as others in Deaths shade: So silent that her Tongue seem'd only made For Precepts, weigh'd as those in wisest Books: Yet nought that silence lost us, for her looks Perswaded more then others by their speech: Yet more by Deeds then Words she lov'd to teach. This fair Flow'rs seed let none remove till doom; No, though to make some great dead Princess room. The Worlds Triumphant-Courts preferre high Birth; But Saints in Deaths low Palace under Earth May claim chief place, she was a stranger here, And born within Opinions giddy Sphear, A Land, where many, whilst they are alive, Profanely for the style of Saintship strive From others, and themselves as Saints esteem; Yet Sainting after Death prophaness deem. Thence, young, she from the sinful Living fled For safety here among the sinless Dead. Near to this blessed strangers lowly Tomb Who dares for Neighborhood presume to come? Unless, as her Religious Proselyte, Her Mother challenge a just Tenants right. SONG. To a dreadful Tune. 1 You Friends and Furies come along, With Iron Crow and massie Prong; Come, drag your Shackles and draw near; To stirre a huge old Sea-coal Cake, Which in our hollow Hell did bake, Many a thousand thousand year. 2 In sulph'rous Broth Tereus hath boil'd, Basted with Brimstone, Tarquin hath broil'd Long, long enough, then make more room! Like, smoaky Flitches hang them by Upon our sooty Walls to dry, A greater Ravisher is come. 3 If you want fire, fetch a supply, From Ætna and Puteoli! Yet stay awhile, you need not stirre, Since if his glowing Eies shall chance, To cast on Proserpine a glance, He is so hot, he'll ravish her. The PLOTS. 1 Still, still a new Plot, or at least an old Trick; We English were wont to be simple and true; But ev'ry Man now is a Florentine nick, A little Pere-Joseph, or great Richeliew. 2 Babels proud Mistress, who in Rome still doth Rant, (To call her a Whore, were course and uncivil) About fifty years finde, by Faux, her Gallant, Did appear in a Plot as black as a Devil. 3 This Plot was, though cruel, yet very concise; And without slow degrees of melting the Crown, Had dissolv'd both the King and Lords in a trice, Which Calvins dull Cousens were long pulling down. 4 Some seventeen years since, in a Town beyond Tweed, (Which, like Faux his Lanthorne, with Plots became dark) These John's of Geneva devoutly agreed, To make a Lay-fire of a Spirituall Spark. 5 As Wolves love a Flock, these love a silly throng; Like Wolves too they howl, when they go to devour; They fall on the weak, whilst they fawn on the strong; And teach no subjection but only of pow'r. 6 O're Tweed their short Cassacks they brought in small Packs; And fearing the Learn'd, they thought of returning; But disguis'd in no Cuffs, in Grease, and in Blacks, Our Prelates did take them for Butchers in Mourning. 7 For to kill, kill, and kill, was all their kind Errant; (From good Shepheards to Sheep, incredible news) But they from the Prophets did shew us a Warrant, Two thousand years old, and consign'd to the Jews. 8 They took us for Jews by the foul marks of sin, And would be themselves as those Prophets esteem'd, Whose miracles brought their Authority in; Which else by the World, had but madness been deem'd. 9 They Miracles promis'd, but shew'd us not any; Unless this were one of a wonderful sort, That with so little Wit they soon made so many, Great Fools in the City, and Knaves in the Court. 10 With the credulous Sex they first did begin; Even from the mellow Mistress to the green Maiden; Yet on Men they prevail'd not till they call'd in The vehement Knippers, and hot Johns of Leyden. 11 From Lanes and dark Allys, obscurely this Throng, Like the Common-shore crept, which underground passes But rose in a Torrent so high and so strong, That Calvin's meek Sons fear'd the Banks of their Classes 12 They call'd them to cry down the Bishops and Deans, Not thinking poor Saints, that liv'd bare and preacht odly, Without Gowns or Latin, could aim at the means, Ordain'd to support the Sir-Polls of the Godly. 13 To still them the Classes prevail'd with the Peers (Barons true to the Throne, as Greece to great Sander) That their Latine Companions, who seven Hundred years Had sate in their House, should betake them to wander. 14 Yet could not the Leydens abate their fierce looks, Till shortly Cathedrals, some promis'd, should down; The Nests, as they thought of Canonical Rooks; Who sharkt on the People much more then the Crown. 15 Agen to allay them, they promist them leave, For freedom of conscience; which with them is no more, Then to speak and maintain what e're they conceive: As a Spiritual-Mine to blow up Lay-pow'r! 16 This Rabble of Rulers, or rather Rule-quellers, Sent out by the City, were calmly sent back; Some up to their Garrets, some down to their Sellers, Whilst in Westminster storms, Whitehal went to wrack. 17 Whitehal sold those storms which Westminster bought, As cheaply, Heaven knows, as Laplanders sell 'em; But although quickly rayse'd, yet being high wrought, Court Witches could no more then Laplanders quell'em 18 We fear'd not the Scots from the High-land, nor Low-land; Though some of their Leaders did craftily brave us, With boasting long Service in Russe and in Poland, And with their fierce breeding under Gustavus. 19 Not the Tales of their Combats, more strange then Romances Nor Sandy's screw'd Cannon did strike us with wonder; Nor their Kettle-Drums sounding before their long Launces; But Scottish-Court-whispers struck surer then Thunder. 20 A while for the Kirke, they were rude, loud, and hot, As are (under favour) our Course English Gentry, But when this knack Spiritual grew a Lay-Plot, They whisper'd like Lovers hid in a dark Entry. 21 Each Three drunken Comrades a Junto was grown; And talkt no more loud of Brisack, or Casall, But whisper'd how England might strait be their own; By a Covenant devout, as Cat'lin's Caball. 22 At the Court-Game, Revenge, which at Court never ends, Some English like Scots set deep at the Caster; And to blow up a Foe who threw at some Friends, Stak't boldly Three Kingdoms, beside a kind Master. 23 Now Plot upon Plot was design'd every houre, And Mine after Mine, was incessantly wrought; To take in the Court, the decay'd Fort of Pow'r, Which by Traytors within to Parly was brought. 24 A King seems to stand bare, as if never Crown'd, Who Treats with His Subjects when Enemies grown; And when Subjects Treat Arm'd, if then they compound, They, instead of His Foes, become more their own. 25 But now the Besiegers had Plots much assunder, The Peers at the Breach, bid the Commons first venture For Freedom and Truth, that they for the plunder, To pay publick Faith, might at last safely enter. 26 But the Commons to try if the Barons were bold, And durst quite destroy what they would but reform, Said, by Treaty to take it, would shew their Zeal cold, Therefore bade them assist to force it by storm. 27 This Storm was diverted by a pretty small plot; The publick designe was particular grown; For a few of each house were met in a knot, To slack the State interest and fasten their own. Sung as a Prologue when the faithful Shepherdess was Presented. Priest. A broyling Lamb on Pan's chief Altar lies, My Wreath, my Censor, Virge, and Incense by: But I delay'd the precious Sacrifice, To shew thee here a gentler Deity. Nymph. Nor was I to thy Sacred Summons slow, Hither I came swift as the Eagles wing. Or threat'ning Shaft from vext Diana's Bow. Pan sends his offering to this Islands King. Priest. Bless then that Queen whose Eies have brought that light Which hither led and stays him here; He now doth shine within her Sphear, And must obey her Scepter half this night. Nymph. Sing we such welcomes as shall make her sway Seem easie to him, though it last till day. Chorus of both. Welcome as Peace to wealthy Cities when Famine and Sword have left more Graves then Men; As Spring to Birds, or Phebus to the old Poor Mountain Muscovite congeal'd with cold; As Shore to Pilots in a safe-known Coast, Their Cards being broken and their Rudders lost. EPITAPH. On Mr. John Sturmy. Reader, here Sturmy lies; which being known Thou canst not suffer him to lie alone; For when thou study'st well what thou shalt Read, Thou, putting off thy Flesh, wilt come to Bed. Graves from our Beds no other diff'rence have, But that our quiet'st rest is in the Grave: In Graves, even when ill made, we never ake; In easi'st Beds we start, and turn, and wake. But this discourse, to shew where he does lie, (Praising his ease in Death, to make thee dye) Is not so wise and needful, as to tell How much he others did in Life excel: For so, thou, by the Pattern he did give, Mayst for the publick good, think fit to live. Though Sturmy was deriv'd from ancient Race, Though to his Birth his Courage gave a grace; Yet was he not ingag'd in haughty Wars, But busy'd in the Citys humble cares: Liv'd quiet in a sad and furious Age, When Valour every where did swell to Rage; When Justice with the Sword was fain to fence At a close Guard to rescue Innocence. He therefore laid his quiet Courage by, Because too weak to strive with destiny. So plainly just, as kept him safe from strife; Still kind to all, but kindest to his Wife: Who being of his company bereft; Does daily seek him in his Pledges left: Two Pledges left to pay her that esteem Which, for her use, his love had pay'd to them. In ripest years, his mind did secretly Consume his Body, which made haste to dye. Consum'd with grief, to see the publick crimes, He dy'd as thou should'st wisely do, betimes, Master Serjeant's Clients To the Noble Widow. 1 You, Madam, are handsome, prudent and witty, Our Serjeant, alas, too sadly does know it; But, if you can have a passion of pity, His Clients, in troth, must perswade you to show it. 2 He once had a Tongue so sharp and so pliant, That those who provokt it, quickly were undone; More Brains then would serve the head of a Giant Or all the Haranguers of Paris and London. 3 These once were the Gifts his Clients have joy'd in; Now wildly he looks, then straite he turnes stupid: His case and our case is alter'd, quoth Ploydin; He pleads not for Clients, but talks of one Cupid. 4 A Lad of renowne, and still a great Leader Through Lobbys of Court, where he whispers to all; But the Devil ne'r thought to find him a pleader, And whisp'ring our Serjeant in Westminster-Hall. 5 He turnes our Law-Cases to Cases of Love; Demurrers, like Widowes delayes, he does dread; Injunctions are things for a Rivall to move; But when he joynes issue it brings him to bed. 6 All the Legends of love we soon may believe Who watch the amours of this our learned Grandi; He now reads the Poets, and studies to grieve, By quoting the sighs in de arte amandi. 7 Good Madam, unless some mistery lie in't, And Widowes see farther then a Casuist sees, Dismiss our great Pleader, now grown your Client; But send him not home till he payes you his Fees. To my Friend Mr. Ogilby, Upon the Fables of Æsop Paraphras'd in Verse. In Empires Childhood, and the dawne of Arts, When God in Temples dwelt not, but in Hearts, When Men might Teachers by their deeds believe, When Power rob'd none, nor Science did deceive; Nor soaring Thought wildly to Heaven did fly, Searching Records which in Gods Closet lie; To know (since none like God eternal were) How his dominion could at first appeare? Presuming, he nor honor had nor sway Before some liv'd to worship and obey. Vaine thought! could Man doubt God was e're alone. Whose severall being to himself were known? Or, if he Power could want, it must but be Because he could not make fit Companie To tend his own perfections; which were more Then now best Soules can perfectly adore: Or could he, if alone, feele want of sway Who Worlds could make, and make those Worlds obay? For what he since created argues more His Love of doing good then love of Pow'r. Nor so could God mistake, as to believe That to be honour which his Creatures give; Nor could he then, since honour is respect, Want honor till himself he did neglect, For if it might be said, he was alone, Yet to himself his Excellence was known; Which was so great, that if himself could raise His honour higher with his own just praise, He was himself his own abundant Theme, And only could himself enough esteeme. But these vex thoughts, which Schooles unquiet make, And like to madness keep their Soules awake, Took rest, and slept, in infancy of Time, And with seal'd eyes did never upward climbe. To study God, God's Student, Man, was made; To read him as in Natures Text convay'd Not as in Heaven, but as he did descend To Earth, his easier Book; where, to suspend And save his Miracles, each little Flower, And lesser Fly, shews his familiar power. Then usefully the Studious World was wise, Not learn'd, as now in useless subtilties. Truth, naked then, not arm'd with Eloquence, Walk'd safe, because all rose in her defence. But now the gravest Schools, through Pride contend; And Truth awhile, at last themselves defend. So vext is now the World with Misteries, Since prouder Mindes drest Truth in Arts disguise; And so Serene and Calme was Empire then, Whilst Statesmen study'd Beasts to govern Men. Accurst be Ægypt's Priests, who first through Pride And Avarice this common Light did hide: To Temples did this Morall Text confine, And made it hard, to make it seeme Divine: In Creatures formes a fancy'd Deity They drew, and rais'd the Mysterie so high, As all to reach it did require their aid; For which they were, as hir'd Expounders, pay'd. This Clouded Text, which but to few was known, In time grew darker, and was read by none; So weak of Wing is Soaring Mystery; And Learning's light goes out, when held too high: But blest be Æsop, whom the wise adore, Who this dark Science did to light restore; Which though obscur'd, when rais'd and made Divine, Yet soon did in his humble Moralls shine. For that which was by Art for Profit hid, And to the Laitie, as to Spies, forbid, He, as the hireless Priest of Nature, brought From Temples, and her doctrine freely taught; Whilst even to Beasts, Men, blushing, seem'd asham'd That Men by Beasts he counsell'd and reclaim'd. Blest be our Poet too! whose Fire hath made Grave Æsop warme in Deaths detested shade. Though Verses are but Fetters deem'd by those Who endless journeys make in wandring Prose; Yet in thy Verse, methinks, I Æsop see Less bound than when his Master made him free: So well thou fitt'st the measure of his Minde, Which, though the Slave, his body, were confin'd, Seem'd, as thy Wit, still unconstrain'd, and young, And like thy numbers easie, and as strong. Or as thy Muse in her Satyrick strain Doth spare the person, whilst the Vice is slain, So his rebukes, though sharp, were kind and grave, Like Judges, chiding those whom they would save. Thus since your equall Souls so well agree, I needs must paint his Minde in drawing thee. Be both renown'd! and whilst you Nature Preach, May Art ne'r raise your Text above our reach. Your Moralls will (they are so subt'ly plain) Convince the subtile, and the Simple gaine; So pleasant too, that we more pleasure take (Though only pleasure doth our Vices make) To hear our Sins rebuk'd with so much Wit, Than er'e we took when those we did commit. Laws do in vaine with force our wills invade; Since you can Conquer when you but Perswade. SONG. To Two Lovers Condemn'd to die. 1 Oh draw your Curtains and appeare! You straite like Sparks must upward fly; Whilst we but vainly say, you were, So soon you'll vanish from the Eye. 2 And to what Starr both are assign'd (For sure you can't divided be) A Lovers Art can never find. It puzles wise Astrology. To Mr. Edward Laurence. As some, with care, the Mornings looks survay, To guess their comforts from ensuing day; So have I watcht thy early youth, to know How much the World may to thy Manhood owe: And find thy Life is in her entrance cleere, As was the Suns new face in his first Spheare; Ere yet his beames those Clouds and Mists had drawne, Which since must serve for Cypress and for Lawne To younger Wits, when he, from Lakes and Woods, Exhales for sick Aurora, Vayles and Hoods. Yet as the glorious Sun could not proceed Cleare in his Course, but did on vapours feed; As his excess of lustre is the cause, That o're his face those dark'ning Maskes he drawes; So, since your Morne in glory is begun, Your Noone must through exhal'd contagions run; Through mists of common breath, corrupt and crude, Made of the censures of the Multitude; And through those Clouds which ever rise and swell When Envy would o'rcast those that excell. If mighty vertue, like the Chymists Stone, Breed busie Spys and dangers where 'tis known; And should be shyly hid from States, who less Then private Mindes endure a brave excess. If Giant-Vertue, the Crowds Monster be; Not, that they disproportion in it see, But onely therefore it offends their Eyes, Because 'tis good above the vulgar size; If so, then think it not your vertues sloath, When she awhile delayes her purpos'd growth; Till you consult, not only what to grow, But of that fruit, how much 'tis fit to show. And though I have no vertue, by whose force I Pilot-like, might dare to guide your Course; Yet being old (though but a Passenger That have a little markt, how others steere) I may suspect where Rocks in ambush stand, And guess at shallowes of deceitfull sand; Which of my Art no illustrations are To recommend my judgment, but my care. Allow me then, the noble toyle to find The greatest conduct of each greater Mind That Fame in her authentick Roles hath read; In which the Living may consult the dead; And a Record, and Prophecy may see, Of what the Heroes were, and thou shalt be. EPITHALAMIUM. The morning after the Marriage of the Earl of Barymore with Mrs. Martha Laurence. 1 A lover is a high and mighty Thing! Or else we hear wilde Notes when Poets Sing; Loves pleasant Priests who teach the World to wooe. Nor can they want Discretions Light To follow Love's most secret Flight; For they are grave, and of his Council too. 2 But if a Lover so important be That half his Dreames may fill a History, Then must a Bridegroomes Title higher sound; Who first a feather'd Lover is, And then flies upward to the bliss Of being a victorious Lover crown'd. 3 But if a Bridegroome be so crown'd a Thing (For more then Lover is not less then King) How glorious is the Bride who gives that Crown? For though she cannot well depose The Sov'raign Prince whom she has chose, Yet she awhile can kill him with a frown. 4 A Bridegroome and a Bride, Loves King and Queen, Fame sayes, are now at Court, and to be seen; And other prosp'rous Lovers, though but few, And Poets, but they bear no sway; And this, O costly Opera! Thou, fatally, canst witness to be true. 5 I will to Court, and Fame shall be my Guide: But thou, fantastick Fame, canst nothing hide; And I aloof in shade would follow thee: Fame therefore leave thy Trumpet here, To which all listen with some feare; For it does praise but few, and cannot me. 6 Vaine Guide! she whispers every fool she meets; And makes her stops and turnings in the Streets, Which are the Peoples durty Galleries. Hence! least we reach the Court too late! For little sleep does serve the State; And Pow'r, the dublick Scout, needs watchful Eyes. 7 At last, to Hymens Chamber we are come, After our heedful walks through every Roome; Where many cast and cancell'd Lovers stay; Who envy'd this triumphant night; And therefore came ere it was light In haste, to tell the Bridegroome it was day. 8 Awake faire Bride! and be your Bridegroomes dawne! Break through your Curtaines, Clouds, and Mists of Lawne. Like op'ning Buds your early sweets disclose! Though froward Winter now growes old, And coughs aloud with taking cold, Be thou calme June, and our unfolded Rose. 9 But being now display'd, What guilt is thine, That, like the Morne, thou dost in blushes shine? Roses, the Morne, and you, are innocent: And, as in blushes you agree, So are you the undoubted Three That have alike no reason to repent. 10 Thou Bridegroome, noble in thy Minde as Blood, Hast Honour's flame to light thee soon to good: But Honour waites as Page behinde thy Bride. Thou must, to match her vertue, be Humble and harmless too as she; And from griev'd Lovers all her beauties hide. 11 Draw not her Curtaines yet; nor rise to boast What blessings thou hast gain'd, and they have lost: But, free from mischief, sleep awhile, and dreame How kind and loyal she will be, Whilst faster she imagines thee The Lovers Pattern, and the Poets Theam. 12 Arise, arise! you must not undertake To think in sleep all I should speak awake, Or Hymens Priests in blessings can express. The World you know not yet; nor see What will with it and you agree: I am his Priest, and thus have learnt to bless. 13 First, may those interwishes you did make In dream (though you sublim'd them when awake) And may those strange perfections which the Bride (Lifting her Snowy hands) did crave To glorify what both would have, Be all by Hymens policy deny'd. 14 For Hymens Common-weale cannot dispence In private with Monarchick excellence. When singularly good you strive to be Then will the marry'd Populace Cry, Libertie! and soon deface Your vertue to preserve their Vices free. 15 And, though the Ermines whiteness be his grace, Yet it provokes the Hunter to the Chace; So an excessive purity of Love Unarmes you to invite offence, And for a Prey keeps Excellence. You must acquaint the Serpent with the Dove. 16 Next, may your Loves sweet Pledges prove but few; For how can many grow so good as you? Or rather, Hymen kindly grant that none, Though of your own wisht Progenie, May to your selves so equal be In vertue as to second your renowne. 17 For who can such a cautious Envy blame As grieves that any one, though of your name, Should wholly equall you in future dayes; And so a theam to Poets be By which they soon might equall me, And get a flourishing Estate of Bayes? 18 But how, sweet Bride, can envy ere suppose A Rose-Tree budding should not bear a Rose? Or that thy vertuous Mother bore not thee, Or that thy noble Father cou'd To any others trust his blood But such as thy excelling Brothers be? 19 Here then let my fantastick blessings cease. I give you liberty your selves to bless, Whilst Hymens busie Priesthood I lay down. A Poet has not power to add To that perfection which you made When both your wishes joyn'd to make you one. 20 Fame, shake thy Wings! and straite prepare to fly; I came not here to write a History. Nor can I stay, though thou art loth to move. This Court is thy most proper Spheare; For thou mayst sound the triumps here Of mighty Warriours, and of mighty Love. 21 Those are the Songs that keep the World awake. Stay then, and I will send thy Trumpet back; Which civilly I made thee leave behinde: Thy courted looks, if seen with me, Would wither, and thy Musick be But wandring blasts of the unheeded winde. The DREAME. To Mr. George Porter. 1 No Victor, when in Battel spent, When he at night asleep doth lie, Rich in a Conquer'd Monarchs Tent, Ere had so vaine a dreame as I. 2 Me-thought I saw the early'st shade, And sweetest that the Spring can spread; Of Jesmyn, Bry're; and Woodbine made, And there I saw Clorinda dead. 3 Though dead she lay, yet could I see No Cypress nor no mourning Ewe; Nor yet the injur'd Lovers Tree; No Willow near her Coffin grew. 4 But all shew'd unconcern'd to be; As if just Nature there did strive To seem as pittiless as she Was to her Lover when alive, 5 And now methought I lost all care In losing her; and was as free As Birds let loose into the Ayre, Or Rivers that are got to Sea. 6 Methought Loves Monarchy was gone; And whilst Elective Numbers s?t?ay Our choice and change makes Pow'r our own, And those Court us whom we obey. 7 Yet soon, now from my Princess free, I rather frantick grew then glad: For Subjects, getting liberty, Got but a Licence to be mad. 8 Birds that are long in Cages aw'd, If they get out, a while will roame, But straite want skill to live abroad, Then pine and hover near their home. 9 And to the Ocean Rivers run From being pent in Banks of Flowers, Not knowing that th'exhaling Sun Will send them back in weeping showers. 10 Soon thus for pride of Liberty I low desires of bondage found; And vanity of being free. Bred the discretion to be bound. 11 But as dull Subjects see too late Their safety in Monarchal Reign, Finding their freedome in a State Is but proud strutting in a Chaine. 12 Then growing wiser, when undone, In Winters nights sad Stories fing In praise of Monarchs long since gone, To whom their Bells they yearly Ring. 13 So now I mourn'd that she was dead, Whose single pow'r did govern me, And quickly was by reason led To find the harm of liberty. 14 In Loves free State where many sway, Number to change our Hearts prepares, And but one Fetter takes away, To lay a world of handsome snares. 15 And I, Loves Secretary now, (Ray'd in my dreame to that grave stile) The dangers of Loves State to showe, Wrote to the Lovers of this Isle. 16 For Lovers correspond, and each, Though, States-man like, he th' other hate, Yet slily one another teach By civil Love to save the State. 17 And, as in interreigne men draw Pow'r to themselves of doing right, When generous reason, not the Law, They think restraines their appetite. 18 Even so the Lovers of this Land (Loves Empire in Clorinda gone) Thought they were quit from Loves command, And beauties World was all their own. 19 But Lovers (who are Natures best Old Subjects) never long revolt; They soon in Passions Warr contest; Yet in their March soon make a halt. 20 And those (when by my Mandates brought Near dead Clorinda) ceast to boast Of freedome found, and wept for thought Of their delightful bondage lost. 21 And now the day to night was turn'd, Or sadly nights close Mourning wore; All Maids for one another mourn'd, That Lovers now could love no more. 22 All Lovers quickly did perceive They had on Earth no more to doe; But civilly to take their leave As worthys that to dying goe. 23 And now all Quires her Dirges sing; In shades of Cypress, and of Ewe; The Bells of ev'ry Temple ring, Where Maids their wither'd Garlands strew 24 To such extreames did sorrow rise That it transcended speech and forme; And was so lost to Eares and Eyes As Seamen sinking in a storme. 25 My Soul, in sleeps soft fetters bound, Did now for vital freedome strive; And strait, by horror wak't, I found The fair Clorinda still alive. 26 Yet she's to me but such a Light As are the Stars to those who know We can at most but guess their height, And hope they minde us here below. To the Earle of Monmouth. Upon his translation of Bentivoglio. Those who could rule the Ancient World with ease, Could strictly governe all, yet none displease, Were such as cherisht Learning; not because It wrapt in rev'renc'd Mistery the Lawes, Nor that it did the Nobles civillize, But rather that it made the People wise; Who found by reading Story (where we see What the most knowing were, or we should be) That Peace breeds happiness, and onely they Breed Peace, who wisely any Pow'r obey. Books much contribute to the Publick good, When by the People eas'ly understood; But those who dress them in a Forraigne Tongue Bring Meate in cover'd Plate to make Men long. Whilst those who Foraigne Learning well translate Serve plaine Meate up, and in uncover'd Plate. This you have done my Lord! which only showes How free your Minde in publick Channels flowes, But if that good to which some men are borne Doe less then good acquir'd our Names adorne The ceaseless nature of your kindness then, (Still ready to informe unlanguag'd Men) Deserves less praise, if rightly understood, Then does your judgment how to do Men good: Which none can value at too high a rate, Judging the choice of Authors you translate, EPITAPH On the Daughter of Mr. Richard Turpin. Stript from her Silks and Lawnes here lies The joy and wonder of all Eyes. Should I reveale, in what a sweet And just consent, her formes did meet Thou wouldst believe (the Story heard) Nature her self lay here interr'd. And all succeeding white and red Will seeme complexion of the Dead, And ever insuccessful prove, Whilst Lovers know not where to Love. To Edward Earl of Dorset. Ah, What are Poets? Why is that great Law Conceal'd, by which their numbers seek to awe The Soules of Men; Poets! whom love of Praise A Mistress smile, or a small Twigg of Bayes, Can lift to such a pride as strait they dreame The Worlds chiefe care is to consider them. Of this fond race (my Lord) am I; who think (since your rich Wine did purify my Ink) Though you were nobly summon'd now to fight In single rescue of a Nations right, Or chosen now, with popular applause, To multiply, or else to alter Lawes, Yet you should stay to tread the Lists, or sit In Councill, till you read what I have writ: To this presumptuous glory am I grown, Since you adorn'd my Muse and made her known. And to this trouble you your self betray By planting still new Nurseries of Bay. But happy he that can securely please His courser Soul with ignorance and ease; That knowes no more of Nature then what yields Growth to his Heards, and Summer to his Fields. That Studies Art but for his wooing Cloathes; Whose Country-Courage is his hunting Oathes. This Man shall rest untroubled with the feare Least Orpheus useless Sons should vex his Eare: Whilst you must suffer still, and all you get, By ceaseless Courtships from afflicting Wit, Is only, that when Time should rest his Feet, The Windes shall cease to breathe, and Flouds to meet, We wisely have resolv'd that your great Name Shall make the last discourse of Dying Fame. SONG. The Dying Lover. 1 Dear Love let me this Evening dy! O Smile not to prevent it. Dead with my Rivals let me ly; Or we shall both repent it. Frown quickly then, and break my heart; That so my way of dying May, though my life was full of smart, Be worth the Worlds envying. 2 Some, striving knowledge to refine Consume themselves with thinking; And some, who Friendship Seal in Wine, Are kindly kill'd with drinking. And some are Wrackt on th'Indian Coast; Thither by Gain invited: Some are in smoak of Battels lost; Whom Drums, not Lutes delighted. 3 Alass, how poorly these depart, Their Graves still unattended? Who dies not of a broken heart, Is not of death commended. His memory is only sweet, All praise and pitty moving, Who kindly at his Mistress feet Does die with over-loving. 4 And now thou frown'st, and now I die; My Corps by Lovers follow'd; Which straite shall by dead Lovers ly; That Ground is only hallow'd. If Priests are griev'd, I have a Grave, My death not well approving, The Poets my Estate shall have To teach them the Art of Loving. 5 And now let Lovers ring their Bells, For me poor Youth departed, Who kindly in his love excells By dying broken hearted. My Grave with Flowers let Virgins strow; Which, if thy Teares fall near them, May so transcend in Scent and Show, As thou wilt shortly weare them. 6 Such Flowers how much will Florists prize, Which on a Lover growing, Are water'd with his Mistress eyes, With pitty ever flowing. A Grave so deckt, will, though thou art Yet fearful to come nie me, Provoke thee straite to break thy heart, And lie down boldly by me. 7 Then ev'ry where all Bells shall ring, All Light to Darkness turning, Whilst ev'ry Quire shall sadly sing, And Natures self weare mourning. Yet we hereafter may be found, By Destinies right placing, Making, like Flowers, Love under Ground, Whose Rootes are still embracing. In the Person of a Spy, At the Queens Entertainment by the Lord Goring. Know, Daughter of the Sun, reflex of light! The wealth of beauty, and the joy of sight, To whom more Praises I would justly pay But that my shame and grief forbids me stay. I am no piece of Houshold Poetry, But would inform you as a loyal spy. You are betray'd, and led to suffer more, Then Death or Age, inflicts upon the poor. But how can all my sorrows be exprest, Since you have rashly made the King your Guest? Alass, to what? if Madam, there be found, In all the space of this unlucky ground, So much as Lady May'ress provide, To Feast the Taffa'tie Sisters of Cheapside, Let it be said, I liv'd ten years at Court, And want the Wit to manage a Report. What though the Owner of this Building knowes, That to your influence, he intirely owes His preservation, instant breath, and all We Fortunes gifts, or Natures bounty call; But therefore must he needs select this rude Dull way to trouble you with gratitude? I more would whisper if I did not fear, To make even Truth unwelcome to your Ear. Besides, if heard, I should become the Beast, Of sacrifice to furnish out the Feast. Against Womens pride. SONG. 1 Why dost thou seem to boast, vain glorious Sun! Why should thy bright complexion make thee proud Think but how often since thy race begun, Thou wer't Eclips'd, then blush behind a Cloud. 2 Or why look you fair Empress of the Night So big upon't, when you at full appear? Remember yours is but a borrow'd Light, Then shrink with paleness in your giddy Sphear. 3 If neither Sun nor Moon can justifie Their pride, how ill it Women then befits That are on Earth but Ignes fatui, That lead poor-men to wander from their VVits? To the Dutchess of Buckingham. All Maps and Compasses I search to find, So smooth a River, and so calm a VVind As, when all others are in Tempests free, Seem bound, as if they ne'r had bin at Sea. But not discov'ring these; Madam, my fears, Did ask for all your sighs and all your Tears? Your Tears, which were, alass, but vainly spent; For none should grieve that still are innocent. Your Sighs but served to make our Priests enquire. How all their sweetest Incence came on fire, Yet to your grief our prudence must submit; Since all must mourn for that which causeth it. For gone is now the Pilot of the State, The Courts bright Star, the Clergies Advocate, The Poets highest Theame, the Lovers flame, And Souldiers Glory, mighty Buckingham. SONG. [The Lark now leaves his watry Nest] 1 The Lark now leaves his watry Nest And climbing, shakes his dewy VVings; He takes this VVindow for the East; And so implore your Light, he Sings, Awake, awake, the Morn will never rise, Till she can dress her Beauty at your Eies. 2 The Merchant bowes unto the Seamans Star, The Ploughman from the Sun his Season takes; But still the Lover wonders what they are, VVho look for day before his Mistress wakes. Awake, awake, break through your Vailes of Lawne! Then draw your Curtains, and begin the Dawne. SONG. Endimion Porter, and Olivia. OLIVIA. Before we shall again behold In his diurnal race the VVorlds great Eye, VVe may as Glent be and cold, As are the shades where buried Lovers ly. ENDIMION. Olivia 'tis no fault of Love To loose our selves in death, but O, I fear, VVhen Life and Knowledge is above Restor'd to us, I shall not know thee there. OLIVIA. Call it not Heaven (my Love) where we Our selves shall see, and yet each other miss: So much of Heaven I find in thee As, thou unknown, all else privation is. ENDIMION. VVhy should we doubt, before we go To find the Knowledge which shall ever last, That we may there each other know? Can future Knowledge quite destroy the past? OLIVIA. When at the Bowers in the Elizian shade I first arrive, I shall examine where They dwel, who love the highest Vertue made? For I am sure to find Endimon there. ENDIMION. From this vext World when we shall both retire, Where all her Lovers, and where all rejoyce; I need not seek thee in the Heavenly Quire; For I shall know Olivia by her Voice. Sent with a Lock of Hair. Least thou for length and beauty of thy Haire, (Which is to ev'ry Eye and Heart a snare) Shouldsts by the rage of Loves severer sway, Be doom'd for casting Eyes and Hearts away, Wear mine awhile; though mine I know, Cannot mislead with softness or with show: Yet I so love thee, as I fain would share, Love's punishment on thy destructive Haire. The Philosopher and the Lover; to a Mistress dying. SONG. LOVER. Your Beauty, ripe, and calm, and fresh, As Eastern Summers are, Must now, forsaking Time and Flesh, Add light to some small Star. PHILOSOPHER. Whilst she yet lives, were Stars decay'd, Their light by hers, relief might find: But Death will lead her to a shade Where Love is cold, and Beauty blinde. LOVER. Lovers (whose Priests all Poets are) Think ev'ry Mistress, when she dies, Is chang'd at least into a Starr: And who dares doubt the Poets wise? PHILOSOPHER. But ask not Bodies doom'd to die, To what abode they go; Since Knowledge is but sorrows Spy, It is not safe to know. SONG. The Souldier going to the Field. 1 Preserve thy sighs, unthrifty Girle! To purifie the Ayre; Thy Teares to Thrid instead of Pearle, On Bracelets of thy Hair. 2 The Trumpet makes the Eccho hoarse, And wakes the louder Drum; Expence of grief gains no remorse, When sorrow should be dumb. 3 For I must go where lazy Peace, Will hide her drouzy head; And, for the sport of Kings, encrease The number of the Dead. 4 But first I'le chide thy cruel theft: Can I in War delight, Who being of my heart bereft, Can have no heart to fight? 5 Thou knowst the Sacred Laws of old, Ordain'd a Thief should pay, To quit him of his Theft, seavenfold What he had stoln away. 6 Thy payment shall but double be; O then with speed resign My own seduced Heart to me, Accompani'd with thine, To Mistress E. S. Married to an old Usurer. 1 In your black Hair Night may securely lie, Whilst yet you sleep; but when you wake, the sky, Your Face, will be enlight'ned with your Eye. 2 Your Hayre does serve to ease and rescue sight, As Shades resist the piercing force of light: Your Eies and Hair atone the day and Night. 3 Why should a Souldier thus his praises spend, On what he loves and cannot comprehend? Our work is to attain, not to commend. 4 But Wealth has Married Wealth; with Youth Age joyns His feeble heat, and melts his wither'd Loines, Not to engender Men but sev'ral Coynes. To Mr. Benlowes, on his Divine Poem. 'Till now I guess'd, but blindly to what height, The Muses Eagles could maintain their flight! Though Poets are like Eaglets, bred to soar, Gazing through Stars at Heav'ns Misterious Pow'r; Yet I observe they quickly stoop to ease Their Wings, and Pearch on Palace-Pinacles: From thence more usefully they Courts discern; The Schools where Greatness does Disguises learn; The Stages where she acts to vulgar sight, Those parts which States-men as her Poets writ; Where none but those wise Poets may survay, The private practice of her publick Play; Where Kings, Gods Counterfeits, reach but the skill, In study'd Scenes to act the Godhead ill: Where Cowards, smiling in their Closets, breed Those Wars which make the vain and furious bleed: Where Beauty playes not meerly Natures part, But is, like Pow'r, a Creature form'd by Art; And, as at first, Pow'r by consent was made, And those who form'd it, did themselves invade: So harmless Beauty (which has now far more Injurious force then States or Monarchs Pow'r) Was by consent of Courts allow'd Arts ayd; By which themselves they to her sway betray'd. Twas Art, not Nature, taught excessive Pow'r; Which whom it lists does favor or devour: 'Twas Art taught Beauty the Imperial skill, Of ruling, not by Justice, but by Will. And as successive Kings scarce seem to reign, While lazily they Empires weight sustain; Thinking because their Pow'r they Native call, Therefore our duty too is Natural; And by presuming that we ought obey, They loose the craft and exercise of sway; So when at Court a Native Beauty reigns, O're Love's wilde Subjects, and Arts help disdaines; When her presumptious sloath finds not why Art In Pow'rs grave Play does act the longest part; When like proud Gentry, she does level all Industrious Arts with Arts mechanical; And vaunts of small inheritance no less, Then new States boast of purchas'd Provinces; VVhilst she does ev'ry other Homage scorn, But that to which by Nature she was born: Thus when so heedlesly she Lovers swayes, As scarce she findes her Pow'r ere it decayes; VVhich is her Beauty, and which unsupply'd, By what wise Art would carefully provide, Is but Love's Light'ning, and does hardly last, Till we can say it was, e're it be past; Soon then, when Beautie's gone, she turns her face; Asham'd of that which was e're while her Grace; So, when a Monarch's gone, the Chair of State, Is backward turn'd where he in Glory fate. The secret Arts of Love and Pow'r; how these Rule Courts, and how those Courts rule Provinces; Have bin the task of ev'ry Noble Muse; VVhose Ayd of old, nor Pow'r nor Love did use, Meerly to make their lucky Conquests known, (Though to the Muse they owe their first renown; For she taught Time to speak, and ev'n to Fame, VVho gives the great their Names, she gave a Name) But they by studying Numbers rather knew, To make those happy whom they did subdue. Here let me shift my Sayles and higher bear My Course then that which Moral Poets steer! For now (best Poet) I Divine would be; And only can be so by studying Thee. Those whom thy Flights do lead shall pass no more, Through dark'ning Clouds, when they to Heav'n would soar; Nor in Ascent fear such excess of Light, As rather frustrates then maintaines the Sight; For thou dost clear Heav'ns darken'd Mysteries, And make the Lustre safe to weakest Eies. Noiseless, as Planets move, thy numbers flow, And soft as Lovers whispers when they woo! Thy labour'd Thoughts with ease thou dost dispence, Clothing in Mayden Dress a Manly sence. And as in narrow Room Elixir lies; So in a little thou dost much comprise. Here fix thy Pillars! which as Marks shall be, How far the Soul in Heaven's Discov'ry Can possibly advance; yet whilst they are Thy Trophies, they but warrant our Despair: For Humane Excellence hath this ill Fate, That where it Vertue most does elevate, It bears the blot of being singular; And Envy blasts that Fame, it cannot share: Ev'n good Examples may so great be made, As to discourage whom they should perswade. Epitaph on a young Virgin. A. K. Nature a form intended to create, Which might subdue the ruthless Eies of Fate: But Fate (ready to think warm Nature cold, It self too merciful, and Time too old) Has struck the World; forthwith this Beauty dy'd, Times evening Hope, and Natures latest pride. To all Poets upon the recovery of Endimion Porter from a long Sickness. Like the astonisht Sun (that rose and found, His business lost on Earth, when all was drown'd In Heav'ns first Wrath) you look, who still should take Alcæus Harp and keep the World awake. Black with your grief, you make the scornful think, You were Baptized in some ill Poets Ink. But I, who know the cause, come to restore, The Blood and Noble Heat you lost before. Arise! bring out your Wealth! perhaps some Twiggs Of Bay, and a few Mirtle Sprigs Is all you have: but these ought to suffice, Where spacious hearts make up the Sacrifice. Be these your Off'ring as your utmost Wealth, To shew your joy for lov'd Endimions Health. No more like Captives look, like frighted sleep, Or Widows, who for young kind Husbands weep. You shall descend a dark and silent Vault, With Marble Arch'd, from Pariam Quarries brought; There stay, till you those Noble Tacticks write A new, by which the Centaures learnt to Fight. The Mistress. 1 When Nature heard Men thought her old, Her Skill in beauteous forms decay'd, Her Eies grown dimme, and Fingers cold, Then to her Poet thus she said? 2 Catch as it falls the Scythian Snow Bring blushing Roses steep'd in Milk; From early Medows Sent and Show, And from the Persian Worm her Silk. 3 Fetch from the East the Mornings breath; And from the Phœnix Gummes and Spice, Such as she calls when at her Death, The World does smell her sacrifice. 4 Nature of these a Mistress made; But would have form'd a Lover too; And such as might this Nimph perswade, To all that Love for Love should do. 5 This second work she well began, With leisure, and by slow degrees; But found it hard to make a Man, That could so choice a Beauty please. 6 She wrought, and wrought, and then gave o're; Then did another Model try; But less contented then before, She layd the work for ever by. 7 I askt the cause, and strait she sayd; 'Tis very possible I find, To match the Body which I made, But I can never fit her Mind. 8 For that still various seems and strange; And since all Lovers various be, And apt as Mistresses to change, I cannot make my work agree. 9 Now Sexes meet not by design When they the Worlds chief work advance; But in the dark they sometimes joyn, As wand'ring Attoms meet by chance. 10 Goddess, I cry'd, pray pardon me! You little know our Lovers Hearts. The Devil take 'em! they agree! And, Nature failing, want no Arts. The Philosophers Disquisition directed to the Dying Christian. 1 Before by death you never knowledge gain, (For to increase your knowledg you must dye) Tell me if all that Learning be not vain, On which we proudly in this Life rely. 2 Is not the Learning which we knowledge call, Our own but by Opinion and in part? Not made intirely certain, nor to all; And is not Knowledge but disputed Art? 3 And though a bad, yet 'tis a forward Guide; Who, vexing at the shortness of the day, Doth to o'retake swift time, still onward ride; Whilst we still follow, and still doubt our way. 4 A Guide, who ev'ry step proceeds with doubt; Who guessingly her progress doth begin; And brings us back where first she led us out To meet dark Midnight at our restless Inn. 5 It is a Plummet to so short a Line, As sounds no deeper then the sounders Eies, The Peoples Meteor which not long can shine, Nor far above the middle Region rise. 6 This Spy from Schooles gets ill Intelligence; Where Art imposing Rules, oft gravely errs, She steals to Natures Closet, and from thence, Brings nought but undecypher'd Characters. 7 She doth, like India's last Discov'rers, beast Of adding to old Maps, though she has bin, But sayling by some clear and open Coast, Where all is woody, wild, and dark within. 8 False Learning wanders upward more and more, Knowledge (For such there is in some degree) Still vainly, like the Eagle, loves to soare, Though it can never to the highest see. 9 For Errors Mist doth bound the Spirits sight As Clouds (which make Earths arched Roof seem low) Restraine the Bodies Eyes; and still when light Growes cleerer upward, Heaven must higher show. 10 And as good Men, whose Mindes towards Godhead rise, Take Heavens height higher than they can express; So from that height they lower things despise, And oft contract Earths littleness to less. 11 Of this forbidden fruit, since we but gaine, A taste, by which we only hungry grow; Wee meerly toyle to find our Studies vaine; And trust to Schooles for what they cannot know. 12 If Knowledge be the Coyne of Soules, 'tis set Above the Standard of each common Reigne, And, like a Meddall of Gods Cabinet; Is seldome shewne, and soon put up again. 13 For though in one blest Age much sway it beares, Yet to the next it oft becomes unknowne; Unless like long hid Meddalls it appeares In Counterfeits, and for deceit be showne. 14 If Heav'n with Knowledge did some one indue With more then the Experience of the Dead; To teach the Living more then Life e're knew In Schooles, where all Succession may be bred. 15 Then (as in Courts, meere strangers bashfully At first their walk towards private dores begin; But bolder grow when those they open spy, And being enter'd becken others in.) 16 So to his Studious Cell (which would appeare Like Natures privy-Lodgings) my address I first by stealth would make but entring there I should grow bold, and give to all access. 17 Then to her secret Nursery would proceed; And thither bring the World, to judge how she First-Causes, and Times Infancy did breed? For Knowledge, should, since good, to all be free. 18 If Knowledge must, as evill, hidden lie, Then we, its object, Nature, seem to blame; And whilst we banish Knowledge, as a Spy, We but hide Nature as we cover shame. 19 For if our Object, Nature, be correct, Bold Knowledge then a free Spectator is, And not a Spy, since Spyes we scarce suspect Or fear, but where their Objects are amiss. 20 In gathering Knowledge from the Sacred Tree, I would not snatch in haste the fruit below; But rather climbe, like those who curious be, And boldly taste, that which does highest grow. 21 For Knowledge would her prospect take in height; 'Tis Gods lov'd Eaglet, bred by him to fly, Though with weak Eyes, still upward at the light, And may soare short, but cannot soare too high. 22 Though life, since finite, has no ill excuse For being but in finite objects learn'd, Yet sure the Soul was made for little use, Unless it be in infinites concern'd. 23 Speak then such things of Heaven (since studious Mindes Seeme travail'd Soules, and yours prepares to goe) As mine may wish the journey when it findes That yours doth Heaven, her Native Countrey, know. 24 Tell, if you found your Faith, e're you it sought? Or could it spring e're Reason was full blowne? Or could it learne, till by your reason taught, To know it self, or be by others known? 25 Where Men have several Faiths, to find the true We only can the aid of Reason use; Tis Reason shewes us which we should eschew When by comparison we learn to chuse. 26 But though we there on Reason must rely Where Men to several Faiths their Mindes dispose, Yet, after Reasons choice, the Schooles are shy To let it judge the very Faith it chose. 27 How e're, 'tis call'd to conster the Records Of Faiths dark Charter, wrapt in Sacred Writ; And is the only Judge even of those words By which Faith claimes that Reason should submit. 28 Since Holy Text bids Faith to comprehend Such Mysteries as Nature may suspect, And Faith must Reason, as her Guide, attend, Least she mistake what Scripture doth direct. 29 Since from the Soules farr Countrey, Heaven, God sent His Law (an Embassy to few reveal'd) Which did those good conditions represent Of our Eternal Peace, ere it was seal'd. 30 Since to remote Ambassadors are given Interpreters, when they with Kings conferre; Since to that Law, Gods Embassy from Heaven, Our Reason serves as an Interpreter; 31 Since justly Clients pay that Judge an awe, Who Laws lost sence interprets and restores; (Yet Judges are no more above the Law Then Truchmen are above Ambassadours) 32 Since Reason, as a Judge, the Tryall hath Of diff'ring Faiths, by adverse Pens perplext; Why is not Reason reckon'd above Faith, Though not above her Law, the Sacred Text? 33 If Reason have such worth, why should she still Attend below, whilst Faith doth upward climbe? Yet common Faith seemes but unstudy'd will; And Reason calls unstudy'd will a Crime. 34 Slave Reason, even at home in Prison lies! And by Religion is so watch'd, and aw'd, That though the Prison Windowes, both her Eyes, Stand open, yet she scarce dares look abroad. 35 Faith thinks, that Reason is her adverse Spy; Yet Reason is, through doubtfull wayes, her Guide; But like a Scoute, brought in from th'Enemy, Must, when she guides her, bound, and guarded ride. 36 Or if by Faith, not as her Judge disdain'd, Nor, as her Guide, suspected, but is found In every sentence just to the arraign'd, And guides her right, unguarded and unbound. 37 Why then should such a Judge be still deny'd T'examine (since Faiths claimes still publick are) Her secret Pleas? or, Why should such a Guide Be hinder'd, where Faith goes, to goe as farr. 38 And yet as one, bred humbly, who would show His Monarchs Palace to a Stranger goes But to the Gates; as if to let him know Where so much greatness dwells, not what it does; 39 Whilst strait the Stranger enters undeny'd, As one whose breeding has much bolder bin; So Reason, though she were at first Fayths Guide To Heav'n, yet waites without, when Faith goes in. 40 But though, at Court, bold strangers enter, where The way is to their bashfull Guide forbid; Yet he, when they come back, is apt to heare And ask them, what the King then said, and did? 41 And so, though Reason (which is Faiths first Guide To God) is stopt where Faith has entrance free, As Nature's stranger; though 'tis then deny'd To Reason, as of Natures family; 42 Yet straite, when from her Vision and her Trance Faith does returne, then Reason quits that awe, Enjoyn'd when Priests impos'd our ignorance; And asks, how much she of the Godhead saw? 43 But as a prudent Monarch seems alone, Retir'd, as if conceal'd even to his Court; To Subjects more in Pow'r then person known; At distance sought, and found but by Report; 44 So God hath vayl'd his pow'r with Mysteries Even to his Court in Heaven; and Faith comes there, Not prying with a strangers curious Eyes, But like a plain implicit Worshipper. 45 Yet as Court-strangers, getting some access, Are apt to tell at home more then they saw; Though then their Pencill draws Court-greatness less, Then that which Truth at nearer view could draw: 46 So Faith (who is even taught an ignorance; For she by knowledge quits her dignity) Does lessen God-head, which she would advance, By telling more of God then she can see. 47 Our Soules but like unhappy strangers come From Heav'n, their Countrey, to this Worlds bad Coast; They Land, then strait are backward bound for home; And many are in stormes of passion lost! 48 They long with danger sayle through lifes vext Seas, In Bodies, as in Vessels full of leaks; Walking in veines, their narrow Galleries; Shorter then walks of Seamen on their Decks. 49 Art's Card is by their Pilot, Faith, refus'd; Her course by guess she ever forward beares; Reason her Rudder is, but never us'd; Because towards Heaven she ne'r with Reason steeres. 50 For as a Pilot, sure of faire Trade-Windes, The Helme in all the Voyage never hands, But ties it up, so Reasons Helme she bindes, And boldly closs for Heavens safe Harbour stands. 51 In Reasons place, Tradition doth her lead; And that presumptuous Antiquary makes Strong Lawes of weak opinions of the Dead, And what was common Coyne for Meddalls, takes. 52 Tradition! Times suspected Register! Too oft Religion at her triall failes! In stead of Knowledge, teacheth her to erre; And weares out Truth's best Stories into Tales, 53 O why hath such a Guide Faiths progress laid? Or can our Faith, ill guided, guide us well? Or had she not Traditions Mapps survay'd, How could she aime to shew us Heav'n and Hell? 54 If Faith with Reason never doth advise; Nor yet Tradition leads her, she is then From Heav'n inspir'd, and secretly grows wise Above the Schooles we know not how, nor when. 55 For could we know how Faiths bold trust is wrought, What are those Visions we in sleep discern; And when by Heavens short whispers we are taught More then the watchfull Schooles could ever learn; 56 Then soon Faith's ignorance which now doth seem A serious wonder to Philosophy, Would fall from value to a low esteem, And not a wonder nor a virtue be. 57 But though we cannot guess the manner how Grace first is secretly in small seeds sown; Yet Fruit, though seed lies hid, in view doth grow; And Faith, the fruit of Grace, must needs be known. 58 Faith lights us through the dark to Deitie; Whilst, without sight, we witness that she showes More God then in his works our eyes can see; Though none but by those works the Godhead knowes. 59 If you have Faith, then you we must adore; Since Faith does rather seeme inspir'd then taught; And men inspir'd have of the Godhead more Then Nature ever found, or reason sought. 60 To you whom Inspiration Sanctifies, I come with doubts, the mindes defect of light, As to Apostles some, with darkned Eyes, Came to receive by Miracle their sight. 61 And when I thus presume, you are with more Then Natures publick wealth by Faith indu'd, Or think you should reveale your secret store; You cannot judge my bold opinion rude. 62 Even Faith (not proving what it would assure) But bold opinion seemes to Reasons view; And since the blind brought Faith to help their cure, I bring Opinion, Reasons Faith, to you. 63 We, for their knowledge, Men Inspir'd adore; Not for those Truths they hide, but those they show; And vulgar Reason findes, that none knowes more Then that which he can make another know. 64 Then tell me first, if Nature must forbear To aske, why still she must remain in doubt? A Darkness which does much like Hell appear, Where all may enter in but none get out. 65 Thus we at once are bidden and forbid; Charg'd to make God the object of the Mind; Then hinder'd from it, since he is so hid, As we but seek that which we cannot find. 66 Our glim'ring knowledge, like the wandring Light In Fenns, doth to incertainties direct The weary progress of our useless sight; And only makes us able to suspect. 67 Or if inquiring Mindes are not kept in, Put by some few, whom Schooles to Power advance, Who, since themselves see short, would make it Sin, When others look beyond their ignorance; 68 If, as Gods Students, we have leave to learne His Truths, Why doth his Text oft need debate? Why, as through Mists, must we his Lawes discerne? Since Lawes seeme Snares, when they are intricate. 69 They who believe Mans Reason is too scant, And that it doth the Warr of Writers cause; Inferr that Gods great works proportion want, Who taught our reason, and did write those Lawes. 70 His Text, the Soules Record, appeares to some (Though thence our Soules hold their inheritance) Obscure by growing old, and seemes to come, Not by consignement to us, but by chance. 71 Law (which is Reason made Authority) Allows consignment to be good and cleare, Not when, like this, it does in Copies lie, But in the known Originall appear. 72 Could this Record be too authentick made? Or why, when God was fashion'd to our eyes, And very Formes of humane Lawes obey'd, Did he not sign it but by Deputies? 73 Or why, when he was Man, did he not deine Wholly to write this Text with his own hand? Or why (as if all written Roles were vaine) Did he ne'r write but once, and but in sand? 74 Tell me, why Heav'n at first did suffer Sin? Letting Seed grow which it had never sown? Why, when the Soules first Fever did begin, Was it not cur'd, which now a Plague is grown? 75 Why did not Heav'ns prevention Sin restraine? Or is not Pow'rs permission a consent? Which is in Kings as much as to ordaine; And ills ordain'd are free from punishment. 76 And since no Crime could be e're Lawes were fram'd; Lawes dearly taught us how to know offence; Had Lawes not been, we never had been blam'd; For not to know we sin is innocence. 77 Sin's Childhood was not starv'd, but rather more Then finely fed; so sweet were pleasures made That nourisht it: for sweet is lust of Pow'r, And sweeter, Beauty, which hath power betray'd, 78 Sin, which at fullest growth is childish still, Would but for pleasures company decay; As sickly Children thrive that have their will; But quickly languish being kept from play. 79 Since only pleasure breeds sins appetite; Which still by pleasant objects is infus'd; Since 'tis provok'd to what it doth commit; And ills provok't may plead to be excus'd; 80 Why should our Sins, which not a moment last, (For, to Eternity compar'd, extent Of Life, is, e're we name it, stopt and past) Receive a doome of endless punishment? 81 If Soules to Hells vast Prison never come Committed for their Crimes, but destin'd be, Like Bondmen borne, whose prison is their home, And long e're they were bound could not be free; 82 Then hard is Destinies dark Law; whose Text We are forbid to read, yet must obey; And reason with her useless eyes is vext, Which strive to guide her where they see no way. 83 Doth it our Reasons mutinies appease, To say, the Potter may his own Clay mould To ev'ry use, or in what shape he please, At first not councell'd, nor at last controul'd? 84 Pow'rs hand can neither easie be nor strict To liveless Clay, which ease nor torment knows; And where it cannot favour nor afflict, It neither Justice nor Injustice shows. 85 But Soules have life, and life eternal too; Therefore if doom'd before they can offend, It seems to shew what Heavenly power can do, But does not in that deed that Pow'r commend. 87 That we are destin'd after Death to more Then Reason thinks due punishment for Sins; Seemes possible, because in life, before We know to sin, our punishment begins. 88 Why else do Infants with incessant cries Complaine of secret harme as soon as born? Or why are they, in Cities destinies, So oft by Warr from ravisht Mothers torne? 89 Doth not belief of being destin'd draw Our Reason to Presumption or dispaire? If Destiny be not, like humane Law, To be repeal'd, what is the use of Prayer? 90 Why even to all was Prayer enjoyn'd? since those Whom God (whose will ne'r alters) did elect Are sure of Heaven; and when we Pray it shows That we his certainty of will suspect. 91 Those who to lasting darkness destin'd were, Though soon as born they pray, yet pray too late: Avoidless ills we to no purpose feare; And none, when fear is past, will Supplicate. The Christians Reply to the Phylosopher. 1 The Good in Graves as Heavenly Seed are sown; And at the Saints first Spring, the General Doome Will rise, not by degrees, but fully blowne; When all the Angells to their Harvest come. 2 Cannot Almighty Heaven (since Flowers which pass Thaw'd through a Still, and there melt mingled too, Are rais'd distinct in a poore Chymists Glass) Doe more in Graves then Men in Lymbecks doe? 3 God bred the Arts to make us more believe (By seeking Natures cover'd Misteries) His darker Workes, that Faith may thence conceive He can do more then what our Reason sees. 4 O Coward Faith! Religion's trembling Guide! Whom even the dim-ey'd Arts must lead to see What Nature only from our sloath does hide, Causes remote, which Faith's dark dangers be. 5 Religion, e're impos'd, should first be taught; Not seeme to dull obedience ready lay'd, Then swallow'd strait for ease, but long be sought; And be by Reason councell'd, though not sway'd. 6 God has enough to humane kinde disclos'd; Our fleshly Garments he a while receiv'd, And walk'd as if the Godhead were depos'd, Yet could be then but by a few believ'd. 7 The Faithless Jews will this at Doome confess, Who did suspect him for his low disguise: But, if he could have made his vertue less, He had been more familiar to their Eyes. 8 Fraile Life! in which, through Mists of humane breath, We grope for Truth, and make our Progress slow; Because, by passion blinded, till by death, Our Passions ending, we begin to know. 9 O rev'rend Death! whose looks can soon advise Even scornfull Youth; whilst Priests their Doctrine wast, Yet mocks us too; for he does make us wise, When by his coming our Affaires are past. 10 O harmless Death! whom still the valiant brave, The Wise expect, the Sorrowfull invite, And all the Good embrace, who know the Grave, A short dark passage to Eternal Light. To the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. My Lord; How much you may oblige, how much delight The Wise, and Noble, would you die to night! Would you like some grave sullen Victor die, Just when the Triumphs for your Victorie Are setting out: Would you die now, t'eschue Our wreaths, for what your wisdome did subdue: And though, th'are only fitted for your head, Bravely disdaine to weare them, till y'are dead. Such Cymicke Glory would out-shine the Light Of Grecian greatness, or of Roman Height. Not that the Wise, and Noble, can desire To lose the object, they so much admire; But Heroes and Saints must shift away Their Flesh, ere they can get an Holiday: Then like to Time, or books fam'd Registers, Victors or Saints renown'd in Kalanders. You must depart to make your value known, You may be lik'd, but not ador'd till gone: So curs'd a Fate hath Humane excellence, That absence still must raise it to our Sence! Great Vertue may be dangerous whiles 'tis here. It wins to love, but it subdues to feare The Mighty Julios, who so long did strive, At more than Man, was hated when alive, Even for that Vertue which was rais'd so high, When dead, it made him straite a Deitie. Ambassadors that cramme in their breasts Secrets of Kings, and Kingdomes Interests, Have not their Callings full preheminence, Till they grow greater by removing hence; Like Subjects here they but attend the Throne, Yet swell like Kings Companions when th'are gone. My Lord, In a dull Calme the Pilot growes To no esteeme, for what he acts or knowes, But sits neglected, as he useless were. Or conn'd his Card like a young Passenger: Yet when the silenc'd Winds recover breath, VVhen Stormes grow loud enough to waken Death, Then were he absent, every Trafficker VVould wish rich wishes by his being there: So in a Kingdomes Calme, you beare no rate, But rise to value in a Storme of State. Yet I recant! and begg you would forgive, That in such Times, I must perswade you live, For with a Storme we all are overcast, And Northern Storms are dangerous if they last. Should you now die (that onely know to Steere) The VVindes would less afflict us than our feare; For each small Statesman then would lay his hand Upon the Helme, and struggle for Command; Till the disorders that above doe grow, Provoke our Curses whiles we sinck below. To Clelia. To see, and to converse with you, must move The nicest Eie, and coldest Heart to Love: And yet your wisest Lover needs must see, That all his Cordialls of Philosophie Can make him live no longer then you please: The Griefe you make none but your self can ease. Not that you Murder by your tongue, or eie, But that they gently urge poore men to die: For since (the Spring of Justice) Nature can Contrive unjustly to enrich one Man, And leave a VVorld to beg: VVho can desire To live and languish in a lasting Fire? I'le rather haste to the Elisian Fields, And there prepare what that blest Mansion yields. Of Flowers, and Fragrancies to wellcome you, Where is no danger what your eies can doe, Where Fire hath only heate enough to warme, Water but serves to coole, not drowne or harme, Where harshest passions melt to Charitie; Where all your Slaves shall meet their Jubilie; Where we shall dread no Heavenly beauties force, And where no heart shall be without remorse. Could you complaine if Nature only had Your Eyes and Cheeks, and Forehead richly clad In her best Liveries, Roses, Lillies hue? But to all these she hath bestow'd on you So rich, so great, so eminent a Soule, As may suffice all Empires to controule; A Soul so farr beyond all outward parts, As these but court the Eie, that conquers Hearts. A Soul so farr exceeding your own Sex, It may the wisest of Mankind perplex. But, for all this, faire Clelia, think not I Will fondly whine away my breath and die; No, though you make me not the least returne, Or tell me, though I die, you will not mourne; Nay, though you smiling, place me in the Traine Of that vast number your faire eyes have slaine. But least that humour which hath kept me free From other Beauties, should not prove to be Of force enough to save me from your Charmes, ('Gainst which herhaps my best defensive Armes May prove too weak) I only beg this boone; Treat me but ill I cannot be undone. Be sure to use such cold indifference I may not see a glimpse, or least pretence Of hope that I can ever love again: And, if you find that will not cure my paine, Goe on to slight me, if that will not doe, Proceed to be a little rude, and scorne me too: If, after this, your Charmes have pow'r to kill, In my last pangs I will not wish you ill.

An old Headpiece, batter'd with shot The which as one of Mancla sweares, Was sometimes worn by Don Quixot However now tis stollen from's Heirs, Come away, &amp;c. Tobacco that when growing stunk Sack which like Beer-Vinegar looks With these they made the Devil drunk, And since that time are chief in's Books; Come away, &amp;c. Olives, and Capers you may buy, Which sawce they send for us to eat, No marvail of their courtesie, What need they sawce, that have no Meat; Come away, &amp;c. Raysins like Grapes in Claret Lees And Pruines dryed, to skin and stone, Currans, like Fruit of Eldern Trees, Almonds sowre, moist Fig piss'd upon; Come away, &amp;c. Prologue for the Temple: at the Acting of Fivehours Adventure, to my Lord Chancelor. My Lord, you in your early youth did sit, As Patron and as Censor too of VVit; VVhen onely that which you approvd could please In Theaters, the Muses Palaces. As you were then our Judge, so now we come, In yearly trial to receive our doom. If we be Pris'ners, yet there still is care, To make for Pris'ners room at every Bar. And we suppose it should be least deny'd, To those who hither come not to be try'd For actions past, but must be judg'd by you, Immediately for what they are to do. VVe Spaniards fight with Swords which are too long, To shew the Art of Fencing in a Throng: Nor do we fight with such a desp'rate Mind That to a Sawpit we would be confin'd. When our Don Henrique 'gainst Octavio draws, Both may incur the danger of your Laws, For wanting space to traverse here the ground, Missing themselves, they may Spectators wound. Though (noble Gentlemen) it long has bin, Your special Priviledge to hedg us in; Yet quit that antient Priviledge to day, And venture not your Lives to spoil a Play. EPILOGUE to the King at Whitehall, at the Acting the Siege of Rhodes. If Mighty Sir, Your Goodness will do Grace, To the supream of Ottomans high Race, Who so much honoured Vertue even in Foes, That oft when conquer'd they did nothing lose. If to that Beauty you will favor shew, VVhich he ador'd and your lov'd Titian drew; Roxana, who restor'd th' Hungarian Crown, And nurs'd the Royal Infant as her own. If you will favor that Sicilian VVife, VVho oft her Honour, and her Husbands Life, Sav'd by her Vertue, when the Victor strove, At once to vanquish Rhodes and conquer Love. If Rhodians from oblivion you'l redeem, Rescuing their Fame, though none could rescue them; VVhose valor there the highest VVonders wrought, VVhere the brave Subjects of your Empire fought. If these contracted, and in little shown, You after conquest on the Scene will own; Then Rhodes shall nobly gain by being lost; And th' Ottomans may grieve whilst we may boast. That they got less when they did Rhodes subdue, Then now the Muses get by gaining you. EPILOGUE to the Villain; A Dorekeeper comes in hast to Mr. Betterton. Author has sent twice to speak with you., What? ere I shift my Cloaths? can he not stay, Till our own Scouts bring Tidings of the Play. There's ten times more ado with a young Wit, Then with old Fools that have whole Volumes writ. Well plainly, and in Brief (howe're we speed) I wish the louder Criticks would take heed. Perhaps, before they get to the next street, Some of their Consort may a challenge meet: Good Gentlemen! do not mistake, I pray, Our Author in misconstruing what I say. He would not challenge any one to fight; But, which is worse, does threaten all that write. The First Dayes Entertainment at Rutland-House, by Declamations and Musick: after the manner of the Ancients. The verse has been extracted from prose text. After a Flourish of Musick, the Curtains are Drawn, and the Prologue enters. PROLOGUE. Me-thinks, as if assur'd of some disgrace, I should step back, ere scarce I shew my face: 'Tis not through terror, that I know not how To fashion my approaches, vail, and bow, But that displeasure in your looks I spy, Which seem to turn aside and stand awry. Ere yet we can offend, are we disgrac'd? Or are our Benches, not your looks misplac'd? We wish we could have found this Roof so high, That each might be allow'd a Canopy, And could the walls to such a wideness draw, That all might sit at ease in Chaise a bras. But though you cannot front our Cup-board-Scene, Nor sit so eas'ly as to stretch and leane; Yet you are so divided and so plac'd, That half are freely by the other fac'd; And we are shrewdly jealous that you come Not meerly to hear us, or see the Room; But rather meet here to be met, I mean, Each would see all, and would of all be seen. Which we but guess, respectfully, to shew You worthy of your selves, not we of you. Think this your passage, and the narrow way To our Elisian Field, the Opera: Tow'rds which some say we have gone far about, Because it seemes so long since we set out. Think now the way grown short, and that you light At this small Inn, to bait, not stay all night: Where you shall find, what you will much despise; The Host grown old, and worse then old, half wise. Still former time applauds, the present blames; And talkes so long, that be (indeed) Declaims. From Declamations of a long hours length, Made strong to last, by some dead Authors strength, Not pow'rfull to perswade, but to provoke; Long, grave, and sullen as a mourning Cloak; I wish, if possible, you could scape free; But, plainly, and in brief, it cannot be. These you must please to hear, and have no way To give the anguish of your Ears allay, But by our Rostra's, to remember Rome; Then hope, such mighty Minds in time may come As think it equal glory to take care To speak wise things, as to do great in war: Declaming well on what they well have done; Being best guides where they the race have run: Quickning by influence of their Noble deeds Glory in others, till it Vertue breeds: What do I mean? Sure there is something here Has such infection as I ought to fear! Here I a short and bashful Prologue came; But strait grow long and bold; that is, Declame. What patience can endure speech bold and long, Where sence is weak too, when the Lungs are strong? Yet this will rare abridgment seem in me, When four shall come and talke a History. Well, I have now devis'd, for your reliefe, How you shall make these long Declaimers, brief; When you perceive their voices fall with fear, (As not accustom'd to the Publick-Ear) And that they pause, grow pale, and look about; Laugh but aloud, and you will put them out. The Curtains are clos'd again. A Consort of Instrumental Musick, adapted to the sullen Disposition of Diogenes, being heard a while, the Curtains are suddenly open'd, and in two gilded Rostras appear sitting, Diogenes the Cynick, and Aristophanes the Poet, in Habits agreeable to their Country and Professions: who Declaim Against, and For Publick Entertainment by Morall Representations. The Curtains are suddenly clos'd, and the Company entertain'd by Instrumental and Vocal Musick; with this Song. SONG. 1 Did ever War so cease That all might Olive weare? All sleepy grow with Peace, And none be wak'd with fear? 2 Does Time want Wings to fly, Or Death ere make a stand? Men must grow old and die: Storms drive us from Sea to Tempests at Land. Chorus. This through his Tub the Cynick saw; Where vainly with Time he did strive, And in vain from Death did withdraw By bury'ng himself alive. 1 The Poets they are wise, All evils they expect, And so prevent surprize, Whilst troubles they neglect. 2 Can Age ere do them harm, Who chearfully grow old? Mirth keeps their hearts still warme, Fooles think themselves safe in sorrow and cold. Chorus. Then let the sour Cynick live coopt; Let him quake in his thrid-bare Cloak Till he find his old Tub unhoopt, His Staff and his Lanthorn broke. The Song being ended, A Consort of Instrumental Musick, after the French Composition, being heard a while, the Curtains are suddenly open'd, and in the Rostras appear sitting a Parisian and a Londoner, in the Livery Robes of both Cities, who Declaime concerning the præeminence of Paris and London. The Curtains are suddenly clos'd, and the Company entertain'd by Instrumental and Vocal Musick, with this Song. SONG. 1 London is smother'd with sulph'rous fires; Still she wears a black Hood and Cloak, Of Sea-coal Smoak, As if she mourn'd for Brewers and Dyers. Chorus. But she is cool'd and cleans'd by streams Of flowing and of ebbing Thames. 2 Though Paris may boast a clearer Sky, Yet wanting flows and ebbs of Sene, To keep her clean, She ever seems choakt when she is adry. Chorus. And though a Ship her Scutcheon be, Yet Paris hath no Ship at Sea. The Song ended, the Curtains are drawn open again, and the Epilogue enters. EPILOGUE. Too late we told you, some two hours ago, The ills, which you were sure too soon to know. Had we fore-warn'd you but the day before, By half so much, said at our outward door, We had been civil, but had weakly shown More care to watch your profit then our own. We have your Money, true; if you can call That ours, of which we make no use at all. The Poets never mind such toys as these— Shews Money in his hand. But keep them to be sent for when you please. At worst (if you may credit, in frail times, Bankers who turn and wind a world of Rimes) They are but bow'd, laid in a Trunk above, And kept, as simple Tokens of your love. If this were raillery, it could not please, After a tedious dull Diogenes: A Poet a mile longer, then, two more, To vex you, having had too much before. Perhaps, some were so couzen'd as to come, To see us weave in the Dramatique Loom: To trace the winding Scenes, like subtle Spies, Bred in the Muses Camp, safe from surprize: Where you by Art learn joy, and when to mourn; To watch the Plots swift change, and counterturn: When Time moves swifter then by Nature taught; And by a Chorus Miracles are wrought; Making an Infant instantly a Man: These were your Plays, but get them if you can. After a Flourish of loud Musick, the Curtain is clos'd, and the Entertainment ended. The Vocal and Instrumental Musick was compos'd by Doctor Charles Coleman, Captain Henry Cook, Mr. Henry Lawes, and Mr. George Hudson. Cœlum Britannicum, A Masque at Whitehal in the Banquetting-House, on Shrove-Tuesday night, the 18 of February 1633 The Description of the Scene. The first thing that presented it self to the sight, was a rich Ornament, that enclosed the Scæne; in the upper part of which, were great branches of Foliage growing out of leaves and huskes, with a Coronice at the top; and in the midst was placed a large compartiment composed of Groteske work, wherein were Harpies with wings and Lions clawes, and their hinder parts converted into leaves and branches: over all was a broken Frontispiece, wrought with scrowles and masque heads of Children; and within this a Table adorn'd with a lesser Compartiment, with this Inscription, CÆLUM BRITANNICUM: The two sides of this Ornament were thus ordered: First, from the ground arose a square Basement, and on the Plinth stood a great vaze of gold, richly enchased, and beautified with Sculptures of great Releine, with frutages hanging from the upper part: At the foot of this sate two Youths naked, in their natural colours; each of these with one arme supported the Vase; on the cover of which stood two young women in Draperies, arme in arme; the one figuring the glory of Princes, and the other Mansuetude: their other armes bore up an Oval, in which, to the Kings Majesty was this Impress, A Lyon with an Imperial Crown on his head; the words, Animum sub pectore forti: On the other side was the like composition, but the design of the Figures varied; and in the Oval on the top, being born up by Nobility and Fecundity, was this Impresse to the Queens Majesty, A Lilly growing with branches and leaves, and three lesser Lillies springing out of the Stem; the words, Semper inclita virtus: All this Ornament was heightned with Gold, and for the Invention and various composition, was the newest and most graceful that hath been done in this place. The Curtain was watchet, and a pale yellow in panes, which flying up on the sudden, discovered the Scæne, representing old Arches, old Palaces, decayed walls, parts of Temples, Theaters, Basilica's and Therme, with confused heaps of broken Columnes, Bases, Coronices and Statues, lying as under ground, and altogether resembling the ruines of some great City of the ancient Romans, or civiliz'd Britaines. This strange prospect detain'd the eyes of the Spectators some time, when to a loud Musick Mercury descends; on the upper part of his Chariot stands a Cock in action of crowing: his habit was a Coat of Flame colour girt to him, and a white mantle trimm'd with gold and silver; upon his head a wreath with small fals of white Feathers, a Caduseus in his hand, and wings at his heels; being come to the ground, he dismounts and goes up to the State. Mercury. From the high Senate of the gods to you Bright glorious Twins of Love and Majesty, Before whose Throne three warlike Nations bend Their willing knees, on whose Imperial browes The regal Circle prints no awful frownes To fright your Subjects, but whose calmer eyes Shed joy and safety on their melting hearts That flow with cheerful loyal reverence, Come I Cyllenius, Joves Ambassadour: Not, as of old, to whisper amorous tales Of wanton love, into the glowing eare, Of some choyce beauty in this numerous traine; Those days are fled, the rebel flame is quench'd In heavenly brests, the gods have sworn by Styx Never to tempt yeilding mortality To loose embraces. Your exemplar life Hath not alone transfus'd a zealous heat Of imitation through your vertuous Court, By whose bright blaze your Palace is become The envy'd pattern of this under-world, But the aspiring flame hath kindled heaven; Th'immortal bosomes burn with emulous fires, Jove rivals your great vertues; Royal Sir, And Juno Madam, your attractive graces; He his wild lusts, her raging jealousies She layes aside, and through th'Olympique hall, As yours doth here, their great example spreads, And though of old, when youthful blood conspir'd With his new Empire, prone to heats of lust, He acted incests, rapes, adulteries On earthly beauties, which his raging Queen, Swoln with revengeful fury turn'd to beasts, And in despight he retransform'd to Stars, Till he hath fill'd the crowded Firmament With his loose strumpets, and their spurious race. Where the eternal Records of his shame, Shine to the world in flaming Characters: When in the Crystal myrrour of your reign He view'd himself, he found his loathsome stayns; And now to expiate the infectious guilt Of those detested luxuries, he'll chace Th'infamous lights from their usurped Spheare, And drown in the Lethæan flood, their curs'd Names and Memories. In whose vacant roomes First you succeed, and of the wheeling Orbe In the most eminent and conspicuous point, With dazling beames, and spreading magnitude, Shine the bright Pole-star of this Hemisphear. Next, by your side, in a triumphant chaire, And crown'd with Ariadnes Diadem, Sits the fair comfort of your heart, and Throne; Diffus'd about you, with that share of light As they of vertue have deriv'd from you, Hee'll fix this Noble train, of either sex; So to the British Stars this lower Globe Shall owe its light, and they alone dispence To th' world a pure refined influence. Enter Momus attired in a long darkish robe all wrought over with ponyards, Serpents tongues, eyes and eares, his beard and hair party coloured, and upon his head a wreath stuck with Feathers, and a Porcupine in the forepart. Momus. By your leave, Mortals, Good-den Cozen Hermes; your pardon good my Lord Ambassador; I found the tables of your Armes and Titles, in every Inn betwixt this and Olympus, where your present expedition is registred, your nine thousandth nine hundred ninety ninth Legation. I cannot reach the policy why your Master breeds so few States-men, it sutes not with his dignity that in the whole Empyræum there should not be a god fit to send on these honourable errands but your self: who are not yet so careful of his honour as your own, as might become your quality, when you are itinerant: the Hosts upon the high-way cry out with open-mouth upon you for supporting pilfery in your train; which, though as you are the god of petty Larceny, you might protect, yet you know it is directly against the new orders, and opposes the Reformation in Diameter. Merc. Peace Rayler, bridle your Licentious Tongue, And let this presence teach you modesty. Mom. Let it if it can; in the mean time I will acquaint it with my condition. Know (gay people) that though your Poets, who enjoy by Patent a particular priviledge to draw down any of the Deities from Twelftnight till Shrove-tuesday, at what time there is annually a most familiar entercourse between the two Courts, have as yet never invited me to these Solemnities, yet it shall appear by my intrusion this night, that I am a very considerable person upon these occasions, and may most properly assist at such entertainments. My name is Momus ap- Somnus-ap-Erebus-ap-Chaos-ap-Demogorgon-ap-Eternity. My Offices and Titles are, The Supreme Theomastix, Hupercrittique of manners, Protonotary of abuses, Arch-Informer, Dilator General, Universal Calumniator, Eternal Plaintiff, and perpetual Fore-man of the Grand Inquest. My Priviledges are an ubiquitary, circumambulatory, speculatory, interrogatory, redargutory immunity over all the privy lodgings, behind hangings, dores, curtains, through key-holes, chinks, windows about all Venerial Lobbies, Skences or redoubts, though it be to the surprize of a perdue Page or Chamber-maid; in, and at all Courts of civil and criminal judicature, all Councels, Consultations, and Parliamentary Assemblies; where though I am but a Woollsack-god, and have no vote in the sanction of new Laws, I have yet a prerogative of wresting the old to any whatsoever interpretation, whether it be to the behoof or prejudice of Jupiter his Crown and Dignity, for, or against the Rights of either House of Patrician or Plebeian gods. My natural qualities are to make Jove frown, Juno powt, Mars chafe, Venus blush, Uulcan glow, Saturne quake, Cynthia pale, Phœbus hide his face, and Mercury here take his heels. My recreations are witty mischiefs, as when Saturne guelt his father; the Smith caught his wife and her Bravo in a net of Cobweb-Iron; and Hebe through the lubricity of the pavement tumbling over the Half-pace, presented the Emblem of the forked tree, and discover'd to the tann'd Ethiops the snowy cliffes of Calabria with the Grotta of Puteolum. But that you may arrive at the perfect knowledge of me by the familiar illustration of a Bird of mine own feather, old Peter Aretine, who reduced all the Scepters and Myters of that Age tributary to his wit, was my parallel; and Franck Rablais suck'd much of my Milk too; but your modern French Hospital of Oratory is meer counterfeit, an arrant Mountebank, for though fearing no other tortures then his Sciatica, he discourses of Kings and Queens with as little reverence as of Groomes and Chamber-maids, yet he wants their fang-teeth, and Scorpions tail; I mean that fellow, who to add to his stature, thinks it a greater grace to dance on his tiptoes like a Dogg in a Doublet, then to walk like other men on the soles of his feet. Merc. No more impertinent Trifeler, you disturb The great affair with your rude scurrilous chat: What doth the knowledge of your abject state Concern Jove's solemn Message? Mom. Sir, by your favor, though you have a more especiall Commission of employment from Jupiter, and a larger entertainment from his Exchequer, yet as a free-born god I have the liberty to travel at mine own charges, without your Pass or Countenance; and that it may appear, a sedulous acute observer may know as much as a dull flegmatique Ambassador, and wears a treble key to unlock the mysterious Cyphers of your dark secrecies, I will discourse the politique state of heaven to this trim Audience.— At this the Scæne changeth, and in the heaven is discovered a Spheare, with Stars placed in their several Images; born up by a huge naked Figure (only a piece of Drapery hanging over his thigh) kneeling and bowing forwards, as if the great weight lying on his shoulders opprest him, upon his head a Crown, by all which he might easily be known to be Atlas. —You shall understand that Jupiter upon the inspection of I know not what vertuous presidents extant (as they say) here in this Court, but as I more probably guess out of the consideration of the decay of his natural abilities, hath before a frequent convocation of the superlunary Peers in a solemn Oration recanted, disclaimed, and utterly renounced all the lascivious extravagancies, and riotous enormities of his forepast licentious life, and taken his oath on Juno's Breviary, religiously kissing the two-leav'd book, never to stretch his limbs more betwixt adulterous sheets, and hath with pathetical remonstrances exhorted, and under strict penalties enjoyned a respective conformity in the several subordinate Deities; and because the Libertines of Antiquity, the Ribald Poets, to perpetuate the memory and example of their triumphs over chastity, to all future imitation, have in their immortal songs celebrated the Martyrdom of those Strumpets under the persecution of the wives, and devolved to posterity the pedigrees of their whores, bawds, and bastards; it is therefore by the authority aforesaid enacted, that this whole Army of Constellations be immediately disbanded and casheer'd, so to remove all imputation of impiety from the Cœlestial Spirits, and all lustful influences upon terrestrial bodies; and consequently that there be an Inquisition erected to exspunge in the Ancient, and suppress in the Modern and succeeding Poems and Pamphlets, all past, present, and future mention of those abjur'd heresies, and to take particular notice of all ensuing incontinencies, and punish them in the high Commission Court. Am not I in election to be a tall Statesman think you, that can repeat a passage at a Counsel-table thus punctually? Merc. I shun in vain the importunity With which this Snarler vexeth all the Gods, Jove cannot scape him: well, what else from Heaven? Mom. Heaven! Heaven is no more the place it was; a Cloyster of Carthusians, a Monastery of converted gods, Jove is grown old and fearful, apprehends a subversion of his Empire, and doubts lest Fate should introduce a legal succession in the legitimate heir, by reposessing the Titanian line, and hence springs all this innovation. We have had new orders read in the Presence-Chamber, by the Vi-President of Pernassus, too strict to be observed long. Monopolies are called in, sophistication of wares punished, and rates imposed on Comodities. Injunctions are gone out to the Nectar Brewers, for the purging of the heavenly Beverage of a narcotique weed which hath rendred the Idæaes confus'd in the Divine intellects, and reducing it to the composition used in Saturns Reign. Edicts are made for the restoring of decay'd Housekeeping, prohibiting the repair of Families to the Metropolis, but this did endanger an Amazonian mutiny, till the Females put on a more masculine resolution of solliciting businesses in their own persons, and leaving their husbands at home for stallions of hospitality. Bacchus hath commanded all Taverns to be shut, and no Liquor drawn after ten at night. Cupid must go no more so scandalously naked, but is enjoyned to make him breeches though of his Mothers Petticotes Ganimede is forbidden the Bed-chamber, and must onely minister in publick. The gods must keep no Pages, nor Grooms of their Chamber under the age of 25. and those provided of a competent stock of beard; Pan may not pipe, nor Proteus juggle, but by especial permission. Uulcan was brought to an Oretenus and fined, for driving in a plate of Iron into one of the Suns Chariot-wheels and frost-nailing his horses upon the fifth of November last, for breach of a penal Statute, prohibiting work upon Holy dayes, that being the annual celebration of the Gygantomachy. In brief, the whole state of the Hierarchy suffers a total reformation, especially in the point of reciprocation of conjugal affection. Venus hath confest all her adulteries, and is receiv'd to grace by her husband, who conscious of the great disparity betwixt her perfections and his deformities, allows those levities as an equal counterpoize; but it is the prettiest spectacle to see her stroaking with her Ivory hand his collied cheecks, and with her snowy fingers combing his sooty beard. Jupiter too begins to learn to lead his own wife, I left him practising in the milky way; and there is no doubt of an universal obedience, where the Lawgiver himself in his own person observes his decrees so punctually: who besides to eternize the memory of that great example of Matrimonial union which he derives from hence, hath on his bed-chamber-door, and seeling, fretted with stars in capital Letter, engraven the Inscription of CARLOMARIA. This is as much I am sure as either your Knowledge or Instructions can direct you to, which I having in a blunt round tale, without State-formality, Politique inferences, or suspected Rhetorical elegancies, already delivered; you may now dexterously proceed to the second part of your charge, which is the taking of your heavenly sparks up in the Embers, or reducing the Æthereal lights to their primitive opacity, and gross dark subsistance; they are all unrivited from the Sphear, and hang loose in their sockets, where they but attend the waving of your Caduce, and immediately they reinvest their pristine shapes and appear before you in their own natural deformities. Merc. Momus thou shalt prevail, for since thy bold Intrusion hath inverted my resolves, I must obey necessity, and thus turn My face to breath the Thundrers just decree 'Gainst this adulterate Sphear, which first I purge Of loathsome Monsters, and mis-shapen formes: Down from her azure concave, thus I charm The Lyrnean Hydra, the rough unlick'd Bear, The watchful Dragon, the storm-boading Whale, The Centaure, the horn'd Goatfish Capricorne, The Snake-herd Gorgon, and fierce Sagittar: Divested of your gorgeous starry Robes, Fall from the circling Orbe, and e're you suck Fresh venomin, measure this happy earth, Then to the Fens, Caves, Forests, Desarts, Seas, Fly, and resume your native qualities. They Dance in those monstrous shapes the first Antimask of natural deformity. Mom. Are not these fine companions, trim play fellows for the Deities? yet these and their fellows have made up all our conversation for some thousands of years. Do not you fair Ladies acknowledge your selves deeply engaged now to those Poets your servants, that in the height of commendation have rais'd your beauties to a parallel with such exact proportions, or at least ranked you in their spruce society. Hath not the consideration of these Inhabitants rather frighted your thoughts utterly from the contemplation of the place? but now that those heavenly Mansions are to be voyd, you that shall hereafter be found unlodged, will become inexcusable; especially since Vertue alone shall be a sufficient title, fine, and rent: yet if there be a Lady not competently stock'd that way, she shall not on the instant utterly despair, if she carry a sufficient pawn of handsomness; for however the letter of the Law runs, Jupiter notwithstanding his Age, and present austerity, will never refuse to stamp Beauty, and make it currant with his own Impression; but to such as are destitute of both I can afford but smal encouragement. Proceed Cozen Mercury, what follows? Merc. Look up and mark where the bright Zodiack Hangs like a Belt about the brest of heaven; On the right shoulder, like a flaming Jewel, His shell, with nine rich Topazes adorn'd, Lord of this Tropique, sits the skalding Crab: He, when the Sun gallops in full career His annual race; his ghastly claws uprear'd, Frights at the confines of the torrid Zone, The fiery teame, and proudly stops their course, Making a solstice, till the fierce Steeds learn His backward paces, and so retrograde Post down-hill to th' oppos'd Capricorne. Thus I depose him from his laughty Throne; Drop from the Sky into the briny flood, There teach thy motion to the ebbing Sea, But let those fires that beautifi'd thy shell, Take humane shapes, and the disorder show Of thy regressive paces here below. The second Antimask is Danc'd in retrograde paces, expressing obliquity in motion. Mom. This Crab, I confess, did ill become the heavens, but there is another that more infests the earth, and makes such a solstice in the politer Arts and Sciences, as they have not been observed for many Ages to have made any sensible advance: could you but lead the learned Squadrons with a Masculine resolution past this point of retrogradation, it were a benefit to mankind worthy the power of a god, and to be payed with Altars: but that not being the work of this night, you may pursue your purposes: what not succeeds? Merc. Vice, that unbodied, in the Appetite Erects his Throne, hath yet, in bestial shapes, Branded, by Nature, with the Character And distinct stamp of some peculiar Ill, Mounted the Sky and fix'd his Trophies there: As fawning flattery in the little Dog; I'th bigger, churlish Murmur; Cowardize I'th timerous Hare; Ambition in the Eagle: Rapine and Avarice in th' adventrous Ship That sail'd to Colchos for the Golden fleece: Drunken distemper in the Goblet flowes; I'th Dart and Scorpion, biting Calumny; In Hercules and the Lion, furious rage; Vain Ostentation in Cassiope: All these I to eternal exile doom, But to this place their emblem'd Vices summon, Clad in those proper Figures, by which best Their incorporeal nature is exprest. The third Antimask is danc'd of those several vices, expressing the deviation from Vertue. Mom. From henceforth it shall be no more said in the Proverb, when you would express a riotous Assembly, That hell, but heaven is broke loose, this was an arrant Goal-delivery, all the prisons of your great Cities could have vomited more corrupt matter: but Couzen Cyllenius, in my judgment it is not safe that these infectious persons should wander here to the hazard of this Island, they threatned less danger when they were nayl'd to the Firmament: I should conceive it a very discreet course, since they are provided of a tall Vessel of their own ready rigg'd, to embark them all together in that good Ship called the Argo, and send them to the Plantation in New-England, which hath purg'd more virulent humors from the politique body, then Guiacum and all the West-Indian druggs have from the natural bodies of this Kingdom: Can you devise how to dispose them better? Mer. They cannot breath this pure and temperate Air Where Vertue lives, but will with hasty flight, 'Mongst fogs and vapours, seek unfound abodes; Fly after them, from your usurped seats, You foul remainders of that viperous brood: Let not a Star of the luxurious race, With his loose blaze stayn the skyes chrystal face. All the Stars are quench'd, and the Sphear darkned. Before the entry of every Antimask, the Stars in those figures in the Sphear which they were to represent, were extinct; so as, by the end of the Antimask in the Sphear no more Stars were seen. Mom. Here is a total Ecclipse of the eighth Sphear, which neither Booker, Alestree, nor any of your Prognosticators, no nor their great Master Tico were aware of; but yet in my opinion there were some innocent, and some generous Constellations, that might have been reserved for Noble uses; as the Skales and Sword to adorne the statue of Justice, since she resides here on Earth onely in Picture and Effigie. The Eagle had been a fit present for the Germans, in regard their Bird hath mew'd most of her Feathers lately. The Dolphin too had been most welcome to the French, and then had you but clapt Perseus on his Pegasus, brandishing his Sword, the Dragon yawning on his back under his horses feet, with Python's dart through his throat, there had been a Divine St. George for this Nation: but since you have improvidently shuffled them altogether, it now rests only that we provide an immediate succession, and to that purpose I will instantly proclaim a free Election, O yes, O yes, O yes, By the Father of the gods, And the King of men, Whereas we having observed a very commendable practice taken into frequent use by the Princes of these latter Ages, of perpetuating the memory of their famous enterprizes, Sieges, Battels, Victories, in Picture, Sculpture, Tapistry, Embroyderies, and other Manufactures, wherewith they have embellished their publick Palaces, and taken into Our more distinct and serious consideration, the particular Christmas hangings of the Guard-Chamber of this Court, wherein the Naval Victory of 88. is to the eternal glory of this Nation exactly delineated: and whereas We likewise out of a prophetical imitation of this so laudable custom, did for many thousand years before, adorne and beautifie the eigth room of Our cælestial Mansion, commonly called the Star-Chamber, with the Military adventures, Stratagems, Atchievements, Feats, and Defeats, performed in Our Own person, whilst yet Our Standard was erected, and We a Combattant in the amorous Warfare. It hath notwithstanding, after mature deliberation and long debate, held first in our own inscrutable bosome, and afterwards, communicated with Our Privy Councel, seemed meet to Our Omnipotency, for causes to Our self best known, to unfurnish and dis-array Our foresaid Star-Chamber of all those Antient Constellations which have for so many Ages been sufficiently notorious, and to admit into their vacant places, such persons onely as shall be qualified with exemplar Vertue and eminent Desert, there to shine in indeleble Characters of glory to all Posterity. It is therefore Our divine will and pleasure, voluntarily, and out of Our own free and proper motion, meer grace and special favor, by these presents to specifie and declare to all Our loving People, that it shall be lawful for any Person whatsoever, that conceiveth him or her self to be really endued with any heroical Vertue or transcendent Merit, worthy so high a calling and dignity, to bring their several pleas and pretences before Our Right Trusty and Welbeloved Cozen and Counsellor, Don Mercury and god Momus, &amp;c. Our peculiar Delegates for that affair, upon whom we have transferred an absolute power to conclude, and determine without Appeal or Revelation, accordingly as to their wisdomes it shall in such cases appear behooful and expedient. Given at our Palace in Olympus the first day of the first Month, in the first year of the Reformation. Plutus enters, an old man full of wrinkles, a bald head, a thin white beard, spectacles on his nose, with a bunch back; and attir'd in a Robe of Cloth of gold. Plutus appears. Merc. Who's this appears? Mom. This is a subterranean Fiend, Plutus, in this Dialect term'd Riches, or the god of gold; a poyson, hid by providence in the bottome of Seas, and Navil of the Earth, from mans discovery, where if the seeds begun to sprout above-ground, the excrescence was carefully guarded by Dragons, yet at last by humane curiosity brought to light to their own destruction; this being the true Pandora's box, whence issued all those mischiefs that now fill the Universe. Plut. That I prevent the message of the gods Thus with my hast, and not attend their summons, Which ought in Justice call me to the place I now require of Right, is not alone To shew the just precedence that I hold Before all earthly, next th'immortal Powers; But to exclude the hope of partial grace In all Pretenders, who, since I descend To equal tryal, must by sole desert. Waving your favor, claym by my example, If Vertue must inherit, shee's my slave; I lead her captive in a golden chaine, About the world; She takes her Form and Being From my creation; and those barren seeds That drop from heaven, if I not cherish them With my distilling dewes, and fotive heat, They know no vegetation; but expos'd To blasting winds of freezing Poverty, Or not shoot forth at all, or budding, wither: Should I proclaim the daily sacrifice Brought to my Temples by the toyling rout, Not of the fat and gore of abject Beasts, But humane sweat, and blood poured on my Altars, I might invoke the envy of the gods. Turn but your eyes and mark the busie world, Climbing steep Mountaines for the sparkling stone, Piercing the Center for the shining Ore, And th'Oceans bosome to rake pearly sands, Crossing the torrid and the frozen Zones, 'Midst Rocks and swallowing Gulfes, for gainful trade, And though opposing Swords, Fire, murdring Canon, Skaling the walled Town for precious spoiles: Plant in the passage to your heavenly seats, These horrid dangers, and then see who dares Advance his desperate foot; yet am I sought, And oft in vain, through these, and greater hazards; I could discover how your Deities Are for my sake sleighted, despis'd, abus'd, Your Temples, Shrines, Altars, and Images Uncover'd, rifled, robb'd, and disarray'd By sacrilegious hands: yet is this treasure To th'golden Mountain, where I sit ador'd With superstitious solemn rights convay'd, And becomes sacred there, the sordid wretch Not daring touch the consecrated Ore, Or with prophane hands lessen the bright heap; But this might draw your anger down on mortals, For rendring me the homage due to you: Yet what is said may well express my power Too great for earth, and onely fit for heaven. Now, for your pastime, view the naked root, Which in the dirty earth, and base mould drown'd, Sends forth this precious Plant, and golden fruit. You lusty Swaines, that to your grazing flocks Pipe amorous Roundelayes; you toyling Hinds, That barb the fields, and to your merry Teames Whistle your passions; and you mining Moles That in the bowels of your Mother-earth Dwell the eternal burthen of her womb, Cease from your labors, when Wealth bids you play, Sing, Dance, and keep a chearful holiday. They Dance the fourth Antimask consisting of Countrey people, Musick, and Measures. Merc. Plutus, the gods know and confess your power, Which feeble Vertue seldom can resist; Stronger then Towers of Brass, or Chastity; Jove knew you when he courted Danae, And Cupid wears you on that arrowes head That still prevailes. But the gods keep their Thrones To enstal Vertue, not her Enemies. They dread thy force, which even themselves have felt, Witness Mount-Ida, where the Martial Maid, And frowning Juno, did to mortal Eies Naked, for gold, their sacred bodies show, Therefore for ever be from heaven banish'd. But since with toyle from undiscover'd Worlds Thou art brought hither, where thou first didst breath The thirst of Empire into Regal brests, And frightedst quiet peace from her meek Throne, Filling the World with Tumult, Blood, and War, Follow the Camps of the contentious earth, And be the Conqu'rers slave, but he that can Or conquer thee, or give thee Vertues stamp, Shall shine in heaven a pure immortal Lamp. Mom. Nay stay, and take my benediction along with you. I could, being here a Co-Judge, like others in my place, now that you are condemn'd, either rail at you, or break jests upon you, but I rather chuse to loose a word of good councel, and intreat you to be more careful in your choice of company, for you are always found either with Misers, that not use you at all, or with fools, that know not how to use you well: be not hereafter so reserv'd and coy to men of worth and parts, and so you shall gain such credit, as the next Sessions you may be heard with better success. But till you are thus reform'd, I pronounce this positive sentence, That wheresoever you shall chuse to abide, your society shall add no credit or reputation to the party, nor your discontinuance, or total absence, be matter of disparagement to any man, and whosoever shall hold a contrary estimation of you, shall be condemn'd to wear perpetual Motley, unless he recant his opinion. Now you may void the Court. Pænia enters, a woman of a pale colour, large brims of a hat upon her head, through which her hair started up like a fury, her Robe was of a dark color full of patches, about one of her hands was tyed a chaine of Iron, to which was fastned a weighty stone, which she bore up under her arm. Pænia Enters. Merc. What Creature's this? Mom. The Antipodes to the other, they move like two Buckets or as two nayles drive out one another; if Riches depart, Poverty will enter. Pov. I nothing doubt (Great and Immortal Powers) But that the place your wisdom hath deny'd My foe, your Justice will confer on me; Since that which renders him incapable, Proves a strong Plea for me. I could pretend Even in these rags, a larger Soveraignty Then gaudy Wealth in all his pomp can boast; For mark how few they are that share the World; The numerous Armies, and the swarming Ants That fight and toyl for them, are all my Subjects, They take my wages, wear my Livery: Invention too and Wit, are both my creatures, And the whole race of Vertue is my Off-spring; As many mischiefs issue from my womb And those as mighty, as proceed from gold. Oft o're his Throne I wave my awful Scepter, And in the bowels of his state command, When 'midst his heaps of Coyn, and hils of Gold, I pine, and starve the aviritious Fool. But I decline those titles, and lay claim To heaven, by right of Divine contemplation; She is my Darling, I, in my soft lap, Free from disturbing cares, Bargains, Accounts, Leases, Rents, Stewards, and the fear of Theeves, That vex the rich, nurse her in calm repose, And with her, all the Vertues speculative, Which, but with me, find no secure retreat. For entertainment of this howr. I'le call A race of people to this place, that live At Natures charge, and not importune heaven To chain the winds up, or keep back the storms. To stay the thunder, or forbid the hail To thresh the unrep'd eare; but to all weathers, Both chilling frost, and skalding Sun, expose Their equal face. Come forth, my swarthy train, In this fair circle dance, and as you move, Mark, and foretell happy events of Love. They Dance the fifth Antimask of Gypsies. Mom. I cannot but wonder that your perpetual conversation with Poets and Philosophers hath furnished you with no more Logick, or that you should think to impose upon us so gross an inference, as because Plutus and you are contrary, therefore whatsoever is denyed of the one, must be true of the other; as if it should follow of necessity, because he is not Jupiter, you are. No, I give you to know, I am better vers'd in cavils with the gods, then to swallow such a fallacie, for though you two cannot be together in one place, yet there are many places that may be without you both, and such is heaven, where neither of you are likely to arrive: therefore let me advise you to marry your self to Content, and beget sage Apothegms, and goodly moral Sentences in dispraise of Riches, and contempt of the world Mer. Thou dost presume too much poor needy wretch To claim a station in the Firmament, Because thy humble Cottage, or thy Tub Nurses some lazy or Pedantique vertue In the cheap Sun-shine, or by shady springs With roots and pot-herbs; where thy rigid hand, Tearing those humane passions from the mind, Upon whose stocks fair blooming vertues flourish, Degradeth Nature, and benummeth sense, And Gorgon-like, turns active men to stone. We not require the dull society Of your necessitated temperance, Or that unnatural stupidity That knows nor joy nor sorrow; nor your forc'd Falsly exalted passive Fortitude Above the active: This low abject brood, That fix their seats in mediocrity, Become your servile minds; but we advance Such vertues onely as admit excess, Brave bounteous Acts, Regal Magnificence, All-seeing Prudence, Magnanimity That knowes no bound, and that Heroick vertue For which Antiquity hath left no name, But patterns onely, such as Hercules, Achilles, Theseus. Back, to thy loath'd Cell, And when thou seest the new enlightned Sphear, Study to know but what those Worthies were. Tiche enters, her head bald behind, and one great lock before, wings at her shoulders, and in her hand a wheel, her upper parts naked, and the skirt of her Garment wrought all over with Crowns, Scepters Books, and such other things as express both her greatest and smallest gifts. Mom. See where Dame Fortune comes, you may know her by her wheel, and that vail over eyes, with which she hopes like a seel'd Pigeon to mount above the Clouds, and pearch in the eighth Sphear: listen, she begins. Fort. I come not here (you gods) to plead the right By which Antiquity assign'd my Deity, Though no peculiar station 'mongst the Stars, Yet general power to rule their influence, Or boast the Title of Omnipotent, Ascrib'd me then, by which I rival'd Jove, Since you have cancell'd all those old Records; But confident in my good cause and merit, Claim a succession in the vacant Orbe. For since Astrea fled to heaven, I sit Her Deputy on Earth, I hold her Skales And weigh mens Fates out, who have made me blind, Because themselves want eyes to see my causes, Call me inconstant, cause my works surpass The shallow fathom of their humane reason: Yet here, like blinded Justice, I dispence With my impartial hands, their constant lots, And if desertless, impious men engrosse My best rewards, the fault is yours, you gods, That scant your graces to mortality, And niggards of your good, scarce spare the world One vertuous, for a thousand wicked men. It is no error to confer dignity, But to bestow it on a vitious man; I gave the dignity, but you made the vice, Make you men good, and I'le make good men happy. That Plutus is refus'd, dismayes me not, He is my Drudg; and the external pomp, In which he deckes the World, proceeds from me, Not him; like Harmony, that not resides In strings, or notes, but in the hand and voyce. The revolutions of Empires, States, Scepters, and Crownes, are but my game and sport, Which as they hang on the events of War, So those depend upon my turning wheel. You warlike Squadrons, who in battels joyn'd, Dispute the Right of Kings, which I decide, Present the model of that martial frame, By which, when Crowns are stak'd, I rule the game. They Dance the sixth Antimask, being the representation of a Battle. Mom. Madam, I should censure you, pro falso clamore, for preferring a scandalous cros-bil of recrimination against the gods, but your blindness shall excuse you. Alas! what would it advantage you, if vertue were as universal as vice is? it would onely follow, that as the world now exclaimes upon you for exalting the vicious, it would then rail as fast at you for depressing the vertuous; so they would still keep their tune, though you chang'd their ditty. Merc. The mists, in which future events are wrapp'd, That oft succeed beside the purposes Of him that works, his dull eyes not discerning The first great cause, offer'd thy clouded shape To his enquiring search; so in the dark The groping world first found thy Deity, And gave thee rule over contingencies, Which to the piercing eye of Providence, Being fix'd and certain, where past and to come, Are always present, thou dost disappear, Losest thy being, and art not all. Be thou then only a deluding Phantome, At best a blind guide, leading blinder fools; Who, would they but survey their mutual wants, And help each other, there were left no room For thy vain aid. Wisdom, whose strong-built plots Leave nought to hazard, mockes thy futile power. Industrious labor drags thee by the locks, Bound to his toyling Car, and not attending Till thou dispence, reaches his own reward. Onely the lazy sluggard yawning lies Before thy threshold, gaping for thy dole, And licks the easie hand that feeds his sloth. The shallow, rash, and unadvised man Makes thee his stale, disburdens all the follies Of his misguided actions, on thy shoulders. Vanish from hence, and seek those Ideots out That thy fantastick god-head hath allow'd, And rule that giddy superstitious crowd. Hedone, Pleasure, a young woman with a smiling face, in a light lascivious habit, adorn'd with Silver and Gold, her Temples crown'd with a garland of Roses, and over that a Rainbow circling her head down to her shoulders. [Hedone Enters Merc. What wanton's this? Mom. This is the sprightly Lady Hedone, a merry gamester, this people call her Pleasure. Plea. The reasons (equal Judges) here alleag'd By the dismist Pretenders, all concur To strengthen my just title to the Sphear. Honor, or Wealth, or the contempt of both Have in themselves no simple real good, But as they are the means to purchase Pleasure, The paths that lead to my delicious Palace; They for my sake, I for mine own am priz'd. Beyond me nothing is, I am the Gole, The journeys end, to which the sweating world, And wearied nature travels. For this the best And wisest sect of all Philosophers, Made me the seat of supreme happiness. And though some, more austere upon my ruines, Did to the prejudice of nature, raise Some petty low-built vertues, 'twas because They wanted wings to reach my soaring pitch. Had they been Princes born, themselves had prov'd, Of all mankind the most luxurious. For those delights, which to their low condition Were obvious, they with greedy appetite Suck'd and devour'd: from offices of State, From cares of Family, Children, Wife, Hopes, Fears, Retir'd, the churlish Cynick in his Tub Enjoy'd those pleasures which his tongue defam'd. Nor am I rank'd 'mongst the superfluous goods; My necessary offices preserve Each single man, and propogate the kind. Then am I universal as the light, Or common Ayr we breath; and since I am The general desire of all mankind, Civil Felicity must reside in me. Tell me what rate my choicest pleasures bear, When for the short delight of a poor draught Of cheap cold water, great Lysimachus, Rendred himself slave to the Scythians. Should I the curious structure of my seats, The art and beauty of my several objects, Rehearse at large, your bounties would reserve For every sence a proper constellation; But I present their Persons to your eyes. Come forth my subtle Organs of delight, With changing figures please the curious eye, And charm the ear with moving Harmony. They Dance the seventh Antimask of the five Senses. Merc. Bewitching Syren, guilded rottenness, Thou hast with cunning artifice display'd Th' enamel'd outside, and the honied verge Of the fair cup, where deadly poyson lurkes: Within, a thousand sorrows dance the round. And like a shell, Pain circles thee without; Grief is the shadow waiting on thy steps, Which, as thy joyes 'gin tow'rds their West decline, Doth to a Gyants spreading form extend Thy Dwarfish stature. Thou thy self art Pain, Greedy, intense Desire, and the keen edg Of thy fierce Appetite, oft strangles thee, And cuts thy slender thread; but still the terror And apprehension of thy hasty end, Mingles with Gall thy most refined sweets; Yet thy Cyrcæan charms transform the world: Captains, that have resisted War and Death, Nations, that over Fortune have triumph'd, Are by thy Magick made effeminate. Empires, that knew no limits but the Poles, Have in thy wanton lap melted away. Thou wert the Author of the first excess That drew this reformation on the gods. Canst thou then dream, those Powers, that from heaven have Banish'd th' effect, will there enthrone th'cause? To thy voluptuous Den, fly Witch, from hence, There dwell, for ever drown'd in brutish sense. Mom. I concur, and am grown so weary of these tedious pleadings, as I'le pack up too and be gone: Besides, I see a crowd of other suitors pressing hither, I'le stop 'em, take their petitions and prefer 'em above; and as I came in bluntly without knocking, and nobody bid me welcome; so I'le depart as abruptly without taking leave, and bid no body farewell. Merc. These, with forc'd reasons, and strain'd Arguments, Urge vain pretences, whilst your Actions plead, And with a silent importunity Awake the drousie Justice of the gods To Crown your deeds with immortality. The growing Titles of your Ancestors, These Nations glorious Acts, joyn'd to the stock Of your own Royal vertues, and the clear Reflex they take from th'imitation Of your fam'd Court, make Honors story full, And have to that secure fix'd state advanc'd Both you and them, to which the labouring world, Wading through streams of blood, sweats to aspire. Those antient Worthies of these famous Isles, That long have slept, in fresh and lively shapes Shall straight appear, where you shall see your self Circled with modern Heroes, who shall be In Act, what-ever elder times can boast, Noble, or Great; as they in Phrophesie, Were all but what you are. Then shall you see The sacred hand of bright Eternity Mould you to Stars, and fix you in the Sphear. To you, your Royal half to them shee'll joyn Such of this train, as with industrious steps In the fair prints your vertuous feet have made, Though with unequal paces, follow you. This is decreed by Jove, which my return Shall see perform'd; but first behold the rude And old Abiders here, and in them view The point from which your full perfections grew You naked, antient wild Inhabitants, That breath'd this Ayr, and prest this flowery Earth, Come from those shades where dwels eternal night, And see what wonders Time hath brought to light. Atlas, and the Sphear vanisheth, and a new Scæne appears of mountaines, whose eminent height exceed the Clouds which past beneath them, the lower parts were wild and woody: out of this place comes forth a more grave Antimask of Picts, the natural Inhabitants of this Isle, antient Scots and Irish, these dance a Perica or Marshal dance. When this Antimask was past; there began to arise out of the earth the top of a hill, which by little and little grew to be a huge mountain that covered all the Scæne; the under-part of this was wild and craggy, and above somewhat more pleasant and flourishing: about the middle part of this Mountain were seated the three Kingdomes of England, Scotland, and Ireland; all richly attired in regal habits, appropriated to the several Nations, with Crowns on their heads, and each of them bearing the ancient Arms of the Kingdoms they represented. At a distance above these sat a young man in a white embroidered robe, upon his fair hair an Olive garland with wings at his shoulders, and holding in his hand a Cornucopia, fill'd with Corn and Fruits, representing the Genius of these Kingdoms. The first SONG. GENIUS. Raise from these rockie cliffs, your heads, Brave Sonnes, and see where Glory spreads Her glittering wings, where Majesty Crown'd with sweet smiles, shoots from her eye Diffusive joy, where Good and Fair, United fit in Honours Chayr. Call forth your aged Priests, and chrystal streams, To warm their hearts, and waves in these bright beames. KINGDOMES. 1. From your consecrated woods, Holy Druids. 2. Silver floods, From your channels fring'd with flowers, 3. Hither move: forsake your bowers 1. Strew'd with hallowed Oaken leaves, Deck'd with flags and sedgie sheaves, And behold a wonder. 3. Say, What do your duller eyes survay? CHORUS of DRUIDS and RIVERS. We see at once in dead of night A Sun appear, and yet a bright Noonday, springing from Star-light GENIUS. Look up, and see the darken'd Sphear Depriv'd of light, her eyes shine there; CHORUS. These are more sparkling than those were. KINGDOMES. 1. These shed a nobler influence, 2. These by a pure intelligence Of more transcendent Vertue move, 3. These first feel, then kindle love. 1. 2. From the bosom they inspire, These receive a mutual fire; 1. 2. 3. And where their flames impure return, These can quench as well as burn. GENIUS. Here the fair victorious eyes Make Worth onely Beauties prize, Here the hand of Vertue tyes 'Bout the heart loves amorous chain, Captives triumph, Vassals reign, And none live here but the slain. CHORUS. These are th' Hesperian bowers, whose fair trees bear Rich golden fruit, and yet no Dragon near. GENIUS. Then, from your impris'ning womb, Which is the cradle and the tomb Of British Worthies (fair sons) send A troop of Heroes, that may lend Their hands to ease this loaden grove, And gather the ripe fruits of love. KINGDOMES. 1. 2. 3. Open thy stony entralles wide, And break old Atlas, that the pride Of three fam'd Kingdomes may be spy'd. CHORUS. Pace forth thou mighty British Hercules, With thy choyc band, for only thou, and these, May revell here, in Loves Hesperides. At this the under-part of the Rock opens, and out of a Cave are seen to come the Masquers, richly attired like ancient Heroes, the Colours yellow, embroydered with Silver, their antique Helmes curiously wrought, and great plumes on the top; before them a troop of young Lords and Noblemens Sons, bearing Torches of Virginwax, these were apparelled after the old British fashion in white Coats, embroydered with silver, girt, and full gathered, cut square coller'd, and round caps on their heads, with a white feather wreathen about them; first these dance with their lights in their hands: After which, the Masquers descend into the room, and dance their entry. The dance being past, there appears in the farther part of the heaven coming down a pleasant Cloud, bright and transparent, which coming softly downwards before the upper part of the mountain, embraceth the Genius, but so as through it all his body is seen; and then rising again with a gentle motion bears up the Genius of the three Kingdomes, and being past the Airy Region, pierceth the heavens, and is no more seen: At that instant the Rock with the three Kingdomes on it sinks, and is hidden in the earth. This strange spectacle gave great cause of admiration, but especially how so huge a machine, and of that great height could come from under the Stage, which was but six foot high. The Second SONG. KINGDOMES. 1. Here are shapes form'd fit for heaven, 2. These move gracefully and even, 3. Here the Ayr and paces meet So just, as if the skilful feet Had struck the Vials. 1. 2. 3. So the Ear Might the tuneful footing hear. CHORUS. And had the Musick silent been, The eye a moving tune had seen. GENIUS. These must in the unpeopled skie Succeed, and govern Destiny, Jove is temp'ring purer fire, And will with brighter flames attire These glorious lights. I must ascend, And help the Work. KINGDOMES. 1. We cannot lend Heaven so much treasure. 2. Nor that pay, But rendring what it takes away. 3. Why should they that here can move So well, be ever fix'd above? CHORUS. Or be to one eternal posture ty'd, That can into such various figures slide. GENIUS. Jove shall not, to enrich the Skie, Beggar the Earth, their Fame shall flie From hence alone, and in the Spheare Kindle new Starres, whilst they rest here: KINGDOMES. 1. 2. 3. How can the shaft stay in the quiver, Yet hit the mark? GENIUS. Did not the River Eridanus, the grace acquire In Heaven and Earth to flow, Above in streams of golden fire, In silver waves below? KINGDOMES. 1. 2. 3. But shall not we, now thou art gone Who wert our Nature, whither, Or break that triple Union Which thy soul held together? GENIUS. In Concords pure immortal spring I will my force renew, And a more active Vertue bring At my return, Adieu. KINGDOMES Adieu. CHORUS Adieu. The Masquers dance their main dance; which done, the Scæne again is varied into a new and pleasant prospect, clean differing from all the other, the nearest part shewing a delicious garden with several walks and per-terra's set round with low trees, and on the sides against these walkes, were fountaines and grots, and in the furthest part a Palace, from whence went high walkes upon Arches, and above them open Tarraces planted with Cypresse trees, and all this together was composed of such Ornaments as might expresse a Princely Villa. From hence the Chorus descending into the roome, goes up to the State. The third SONG By the Chorus going up to the Queen. Whilst thus the darlings of the Gods From Honors Temple, to the Shrine Of Beauty, and these sweet abodes Of Love, we guide, let thy Divine Aspects, (bright Deity) with fair And Halcyon beames, becalm the Ayr. We bring Prince Arthur or the brave St. George himself (great Queen) to you, You'll soon discern him; and we have A Guy, a Beavis or some true Round-Table Knight, as ever fought For Lady, to each Beauty brought. Plant in their Martial hands, War's seat, Your peaceful pledges of warm snow, And, if a speaking touch repeat In Loves known language, tales of woe; Say, in soft whispers of the Palme, As Eyes shoot Darts, so Lips shed Balm. For though you seeme like Captives, led Jn triumph by the Foe away, Yet on the Conqu'rers necke you tread, And the fierce Victor proves your prey. What heart is then secure from you, That can, though vanquish'd, yet subdue? The song done they retire, and the Masquers dance the Revels with the Ladies, which continued a great part of the night. The Revels being past and the Kings Majesty seated under the State by the Queen; for Conclusion to this Masque there appeares coming forth from one of the sides, as moving by a gentle wind, a great Cloud, which arriving at the middle of the heaven, stayeth; this was of severall colours, and so great, that it covered the whole Scæne. Out of the further part of the heaven, beginnes to breake forth two other Clouds, differing in colour and shape; and being fully discovered, there appeared sitting in one of them, Religion, Truth, and wisdome. Religion was apparelled in white and part of her face was covered with a light vaile, in one hand a booke, and in the other a flame of fire. Truth in a Watchet Robe, a Sunne upon her fore-head and bearing in her hand a palme. Wisdome in a mantle wrought with eyes and hands, golden rayes about her head, and Apollo's Cithere in her hand. In tht other Cloud sate Concord, Government, and Reputation. The habit of Concord was Carnation, bearing in her hand a litle faggot of stickes bound together, and on the top of it a hart, and a garland of corne on her head: Government was figured in a coat of Armour, bearing a shield, and on it a Medusa's head; upon her head a plumed helme, and in her right hand a Lance. Reputation, a young man in purple robe wrought with gold, and wearing a laurell wreath on his head. These being come downe in an equall distance to the middle part of the Ayre, the great Cloud beganne to breake open, out of which stroke beames of light; in the midst suspended in the Ayre, sate Eternity on a Globe, his Garment was long of a light blue, wrought all over with Stars of gold, and bearing in his hand a Serpent bent into a circle, with his taile in his mouth. In the firmament about him, was a troope of fifteene starres, expressing the stellifying of our British Heroes; but one more great and eminent than the rest, which was over his head, figured his Majesty. And in the lower part was seene a farre off the prospect of Windsor Castle, the famous seat of the most honourable Order of the Garter. The fourth SONG. Eternity, Eusebia, Alethia, Sophia, Homonoia, Dicæarche, Euphemia. ETERNITIE. Be fix'd you rapid Orbes, that beare The changing seasons of the yeare On your swift wings, and see the old Decrepit Spheare growne darke and cold; Nor did Iove quench her fires, these bright Flames, have eclips'd her sullen light: This Royall payre, for whom Fate will Make Motion cease, and Time stand still; Since Good is here so perfect, as no Worth Is left for After Ages to bring forth. EUSEBIA. Mortality cannot with more Religious zeal, the gods adore. ATLETHIA. My Truths, from human eyes conceal'd, Are naked to their sight reveal'd. SOPHIA. Nor do their Actions, from the guid Of my exactest precepts slide. HOMONOIA. And as their own pure Souls entwin'd, So are their Subjects hearts combin'd. DICÆARCHES. So just, so gentle is their sway, As it seemes Empire to obay. EUPHEMIA. And their fair Fame, like incense hurl'd On Altars, hath perfum'd the World. SO. Wisdom. AL. Truth. EUS. Pure Adoration. HO. Concord. DI. Rule. EUP. Clear Reputation, CHORUS. Crown this King, this Queen, this Nation. CHORUS. Wisdome, Truth, &amp;c. ETERNITIE. Brave Spirits, whose adventrous feet Have to the Mountains top aspir'd, Where fair Desert, and Honour meet, Here, from the toyling Press retir'd, Secure from all disturbing Evil, For ever in my Temple revell. With wreaths of Stars circled about, Gild all the spacious Firmament, And smiling on the panting rout That labor in the steep ascent, With your resistless influence guide Of humane change th'incertain tide. EUS. ALE. SOP. But oh you Royal Turtles, shed, When you from Earth remove, On the ripe fruits of your chaste bed, Those sacred seeds of Love. CHORUS. Which no Power can but yours dispence, Since you the pattern bear from hence. HOM. DIC. EUP. Then from your fruitful race shall flow Endless Succession, Scepter shall bud, and Lawrels blow 'Bout their Immortal Throne: CHORUS. Propitious Stars shall Crown each Birth, Whilst you rule them, and they the Earth. The Song ended, the two Clouds, with the persons sitting on them, ascend; the great Cloud closeth again, and so passeth away overthwart the Scæne; leaving behind it nothing but a serene Skye. After which, the Masquers dance their last dance, and the Curtain was let fall. The Names of the Masquers. The Kings Majesty. Duke of Lenox. Earl of Devonshire. Earl of Holland. Earl of Newport.

Divine Poesie (the Secretary of Nature) is sent by Fate to Indamora, Queen of Natsinga, to signifie the time prefix'd was come, when by the influence of her Beauty (attended with those lesser Lights, her contributary Ladies) the Temple of Chast Love should be re-established in this Island; which Temple being long sought for by certain Magicians (Enemies to chast Love) intending to use it to their intemperate ends, was by Divine Poesie hidden in mists and clouds; so as the Magicians being frustrate of their hopes, sought by enchantments to hinder all others from finding it; and by this imposture many Noble Knights and Ladies have been tempted and angled. The fame of this Temple of Love being quickly spread over all the Eastern world, enflamed a company of noble Persian youths, borderers on India, to travel in quest of it; who arriving, were by the illusions of the Magicians, and their spirits of several Regions, almost seduced, as others had been: But Divine Poesie appearing, discover'd unto them some part of the Temple unshadow'd, and prophecied of the time when Indamora and her Train should arrive to effect this miracle; which though it seems somewhat hard Doctrine to most young men, yet these being spirits of the highest rank, forsaking the false Magicians and their allurements, were resolved to entertain themselves to contemplate on this Apparition, until the coming of the glorious Indian Queen, at whose sight they being inspir'd with chast flames, might be permitted by their faithful observance and legitimate affections, to enter and enjoy the Priviledges of that Sacred Temple. Then Divine Poesie sends Orpheus her chief Priest in a Barque (assisted by the Brachmane and Priests of the Temple, who meet him on the shores) to calme the Seas with his Harp, that a Maratime Chariot prepared by the Indian Sea Gods, might safer, and more swiftly convay them to atchive this Noble Adventure, after whose Landing, having paid their Ceremonies by moving in harmonical and numerous figures, Sunesis and Thelema (which intimate the understanding and the will) joyning together, the True Temple appears, and Chast Love descends to invoke the last and living Heroe (Indamora's Royal Lover) that he may help and witness the Consecration of it. At the lower end of the Banqueting House, opposite to the State was a Stage of six foot high, and on that was raised an Ornament of a new Invention agreeable to the Subject, consisting of Indian Trophies: on the one side upon a basement sate a naked Indian on a whitish Elephant, his legs shortning towards the neck of the beast, his tire and bases of several coloured feathers, representing the Indian Monarchy: On the other side an Asiatique in the habit of an Indian Borderer, riding on a Camel; his Turbant and Coat differing from that of the Turks, figured for the Asian Monarchy: over these hung shields like Compartiments: In that over the Indian was painted a Sun rising, and in the other an half Moon; these had for finishing the Capital of a great pillaster, which served as a ground to stick them of, and bore up a large freeze or border with a Coronice. In this over the Indian lay the figure of an old man, with a long white hair and beard, representing the flood Tigris; on his head a wreath of Canes and Seadg, and leaning upon a great urne, out of which run water, by him, in an extravagant posture stood a Tyger. At the other end of this freeze lay another naked man, representing Meander, the famous River of Asia, who likewise had a great Silver Urne, and by him lay an Unicorn, In the midst of this border was fixed a rich Compartiment, behind which was a crimson Drapery, part of it born up by naked Children tack'd up in several Pleats, and the rest was at each end of the Freeze tyed with a great knot, and from thence hung down in foulds to the bottom of the Pedastals: in the midst of this Compartiment in an Oval was written TEMPLUM AMORIS: all these Figures were in their natural colours bigger than the life, and the Compartiments of Gold. A Curtain flying up the first Sceane was discover'd, in which appeared a spacious grove of shady trees; and afar off on a Mount with a winding way to the top, was seated a pleasant bower, environed with young Trees, and in the lower part walkes planted with Cypress, representing the place where the Soules of the Anciant Poets are feigned to reside: the delight of this prospect was quickly diverted to the sight of a more strange apparition; for, out of the heaven by little and little broke forth a great Cloud of a Rosie Colour, which being come down some little way, began to open, and in it was seen sitting a beautiful woman, her garment was Sky-colour set all with Stars of Gold, her head was crowned with Laurel, with a spangled vaile hanging down behind, and her hair in artificial curles graciously dress'd, representing Divine Poesie, and by her a milk white Swan, as she descends singing; out of those venerable shades came forth a company of ancient Greek Poets, as Demodicus, Fœmius, Homer, Hesiod, Terpander, and Sapho a Poetesse in habits varied and of several colours, with laurel wreaths on their heads. Divine Poesie sung this: Divine Poesie. 1 As chearful as the Mornings light, Comes Indamora from above, To guide those Lovers that want sight, To see and know what they should love. 2 Her beames into each breast will steal, And search what ev'ry Heart doth mean, The sadly wounded she will heal, And make the fouly tainted clean. 3 Rise you, from your dark shades below, That first gave words an harmony, And made false Love in numbers flow, Till vice became a mystery. 4 And when I've purifi'd that Ayr To which death turn'd you long agoe, Help with your voyces to declare What Indamora comes to show. The Poets. Soul of our Science! how inspir'd we come? By thee restor'd to voyces that lay dumbe, And lost in many a forgotten Tombe. D. Poesie. Y'are spirits all; and have so long From flesh, and frailty absent bin, That sure though Love should fill your song, It could not relish now of sin. The Poets. Vex not our sad remembrance with our shame! We have bin punish'd for ill-gotten fame, For each loose verse, tormented with a flame. D. Poesie. Descend then, and become with me, The happy Organs to make known In an harmonious Embassie, Our great affair to yonder Throne. She being descended to the ground in a Majestick pace, goes up the State, attended by the fore-named Poets; and the Cloud that brought her down, closeth as it ascends. D. Poesie. Thou Monarch of mens hearts rejoyce! So much thou art belov'd in heaven, That Fate hath made thy reign her choyce, In which Love's blessings shall be given. The Poets. Truth shall appear, and rule 'till she resists Those subtle charmes, and melts those darker mists, In which Lov's Temple's hid from Exorcists. D. Poesie. Those Magi that with pleasant Arts To their false Temple led of yore The noblest youth, with'ring their Hearts With lustful thoughts, shall be no more. The Poets. For Indamora with her beauties light, The truer Temple shall restore to sight, The false shall be obscur'd in endless Night. The Song after they have retir'd (playing on their Instruments) by the Chorus of Poets. 1 Take leave now of thy heart, The beauty thou shalt streight survay Will tempt it to depart Thy royal breast, and melt away. Yet when she finds thy breast is empty grown, In just remorse shee'l fill it with her own, So neither heart can mourn, or stray. 2 Back to our shades we go, But see how heavily we move! Alas! their feet are slow, That leave the Object which they love. Our dwelling is beneath, but those whose Bayes Is chastly earn'd in thy corrected dayes, Shall after death reside above. After this, Divine Poesie, and the Poets go forth; then the whole Scæne changeth into Mist and Clouds, through which some glimpse of a Temple is here and there scarcely discern'd. The Entry of the Magicians. Out of Caves from under ground come forth three Magicians, one more eminent than the rest, their habits of strange fashions, denoting their qualities, and their persons deformed. (1) Tell me, thou wise Protector of our Art, Why dost thou walk with such a hideous brow? Darkness, and Clouds do hover o're thine eyes; Thou look'st as thou hadst suck'd the vapor of A poys'nous Fenne, till it has made thee drunk, There's venom'd foam about thy lips. (2.) Is thy belov'd Old witch, dead and entomb'd? or hast thou heard Ill news from hell? Does the grand fiend Chain up thy spirits from thy use? Speak, Art Thou not within thy Circle still a Soveraign Prince? When thou dost lift with magick power thy white Inchanted Scepter thus, do not the thin Unbodied people bow and obey? (3.) O the Temple of Love, the mists that hid, And so reserv'd it from our sinful use, (Whilst we seduc'd the more voluptuous race Of Men, to give false worship in our own) must be Dispell'd! this is the sad ill news; and it Is come from Heaven! A troublesome Deity (Whom forsooth they stile Divine Poesie) This morne proclaim'd it from a falling Cloud. (2.) Who? Divine Poesie? (3.) I know her well. (1.) But who shall bring this mischief to our Art? (3.) Indamora, the delight of Destiny! She, and the beauties of her Train; who sure Though they discover Summer in their looks, Still carry frozen Winter in their blood. They raise strange doctrines, and new sects of Love: Which must not woo or court the Person, but The Mind; and practice generation not Of Bodies but of Souls. (2.) Believe me, my Magical friends, They must bring bodies with'em that worship In our pleasant Temple: I have an odd Fantastick faith perswades we there will be Little pastime upon earth without Bodies. Your Spirit's a cold Companion at midnight. (1.) Have we so long mis-led and entertain'd The youthful of the world, I mean their bodies) And now do they betake themselves unto The dull imaginary pleasures of Their soules? This humor cannot last. (2.) If it should, we may rid our Temple Of all our Persian Quilts, imbroyder'd Couches, And our standing Beds; these (I take it) are Bodily implements; our soules need 'em not. But where shall this new Sect be planted first? (3.) In a dull Northern Ile, they call Britaine. (2.) Indeed 'tis a cold Northerly opinion; And I'le lay my life begot since their late Great Frosts; It will be long enough e're it Shall spread, and prosper in the South! Or if The Spaniard or Italian ever be Perswaded out of the use of their bodies, I'le give mine to a Raven for his Supper. (3.) The Miracle is more increas'd, in that It first takes birth and nourishment in Court. (2.) But my good damn'd friend tell me? Is there not One Courtier will resent the cause, and give Some countenance to the affairs of the body? (3.) Certain young Lords at first disliked the Philosophy As most uncomfortable, sad, and new; But soon inclin'd to a superior vote, And are grown as good Platonical Lovers As are to be found in an Hermitage, where he That was born last, reckons above fourscore. To these come forth in hast another Magician, in shape and habit differing from the other, and spake as followeth. (1.) Here comes a brother of our mistick Tribe! (3.) He knows th'occasion of our grief, and by His hast imports discoveries more strange! (4.) News! news! my sad companions of the shade! There's lately landed on our fatal shore Nine Persian youths, their habit and their looks So smooth, that from the Pleasures i'th Elisian fields Each female ghost will come, and enter in Their flesh again, to make embraces warm. (2.) I hope these are no Platonical Lovers, No such Carthusian Poets as do write Madrigals to the mind? more of thy news! (4.) The rest infers small joy, and little hope: For though at first their youth and eager thoughts Directed them where our gay Altar stood, And they were ready too for sacrifice, I cannot tell what luckless light inform'd Their eyes, but Loves true Temple straight they spy'd Through the ascending mists, and would have enter'd it To read grave frosty Homilies, And antick laws of chastity, but that (As my swift Spirit brought me word) a voyce Sent from within bad them with reverence Desist till Indamora did appear, for then The Gates would open, and the mists dry up: That thus conceal'd it from the general view, Which now their expectation doth attend. (3.) 'Tis time to wake our drowsie Art, and try, If we have power to hinder Destiny. Mount! mount! our charmes! fetch me, whilst you aspire, A Spirit of the Element of fire! (2.) Me one of Ayre! (1.) The water me supplies! (4.) Mine from the center of the earth shall rise! (3.) These shall infuse their sev'ral qualities In men; if not t'uphold the faction of The flesh, yet to infect the queasie age With blacker Sins: if we (now we have joyn'd The force of all the Elements t'assist The horror of our will) shall not prevail Against this hum'rous vertue of the Time, Nature, our weakness must be thought thy crime. 2. To these I'le add a sect of modern Divels; Fine precise Fiends, that hear the devout close At ev'ry vertue but their own, that claim Chambers and Tenements in heaven, as they Had purchas'd there, and all the Angels were Their harbingers. With these I'le vex the world. (3.) 'Tis well design'd! Thanks to thy courteous Art! Let's murmure softly in each others ear, And those we first invok'd, will straight appear! Enough! they come! to'th woods let's take our flight, We have more dismal business yet e're night. The Antimask of the Spirits. 1. Entry. The fiery Spirits all in flames, and their Vizards of a Cholerick Complexion. The Airy Spirits with sanguine vizards, their Garments and Caps all of feathers. The Watery Spirits were all over wrought with scales, and had fishes heads and fins. The Earthy Spirits had their garments wrought all over with leaveless trees and bushes, with Serpents an other little Animals here and there about them, and on their heads barren rocks. 2. Entry. Brought in by the fiery Spirits, were debosht and quarrelling men with a loose Wench amongst them. 3. and 4. Entry. Brought in by the Spirits of Ayr, were of amorous men and women in ridiculous habits and Alchimists. 5. Entry. Brought in by the Spirits of Water, were drunken Dutch skippers. 6. Entry. Brought in by the Spirits of Earth, were Witches, Userers, and Fools. 7. Entry. Was of a Modern Divel, a sworn enemy of Poesie, Musick, and all ingenious Arts, but a great friend to murmuring, libelling, and all seeds of discord, attended by his factious followers; all which was exprest by their Habits and Dance. After these was an entry of three Indians of quality, of Indamora's train in several strange habits, and their dance as strange. A Persian Page comes leaping in. Hey! hey! how light I am? all soul within? As my dull flesh, were melted through my skin? And though a Page when landed on this shore, I now am grown a brisk Ambassador! From Persian Princes too, and each as fierce A Lover, as did ever sigh in verse! Give Audience then, you Ladies of this Isle! Lord how you lift your fannes up now, and smile! To think (forsooth) they are so fond to take So long a journey for your beauties sake! For know, th'are come! but sure, e're they return, Will give your female ships some cause to mourn! For I must tell you, that about them all There's not one grain, but what's Platonical! So bashful that I think they might be drawn (Like you) to wear close Hoods, or vailes of Lawn. My Master is the chief that doth protect, Or (as some say) miss-lead this precise sect: One heretofore that wisely could confute A Lady at her window with his Lute, There devoutly in a cold morning stand Two hours, praysing the snow of her white hand; And when he could not rule her to's intent, Like Tarquin he would proffer ravishment. But now, no fear of Rapes, untill he find A maydenhead belonging to the mind. The rest are all so modest too, and pure, So virginly, so coy, and so demure, That they retreat at kissing, and but name Hymen, or Love, they blush for very shame: Ladies! I must needs laugh! you'le give me leave I hope; and 'tis to think how you deceive Your selves with all this precious art, and care Tane in your glass to dress your looks, and hair! When (in good faith!) they heed no outward merit, But fervently resolve to wooe the Spirit! Hah! do you all look melancholy now; And cast a Cloud of anger o're the brow? 'Tis time to flye, and my best swiftness use, For fear I'm kill'd with Bodkins for my news. The Page retires, and the Noble Persian youths make their entry, apparelled in Asian Coats of Sea-green embroidered that reached down above their knees, with buttons and loops before, and cut up square to their hips, and returned down with two short skirts; the sleeves of this Coat were large without seam, and cut short to the bending of the Arm, and hanging down long behind, trimm'd with buttons as those of the breast; out of this came a sleeve of white Sattin embroydered, and the Basis answerable to the sleeve, hung down in gathering underneath the shortest part of their Coat; on their heads they wore Persian Turbants silver'd underneath, and wound about with white Cypress, and one fall of a white feather before. Their Dance ended, the mist and Clouds at an instant disappear, and the Scene is all changed into a Sea somewhat calm, where the billows moving sometimes whole, and sometimes breaking, beat gently on the land, which represented a new and strange prospect; the nearest part was broken grounds and Rocks, with a mountainous Countrey, but of a pleasant aspect, in which were trees of strange form and colour, and here and there were placed in the bottom several Arbors like Cottages, and strange beasts and birds, far unlike the Countrey of these parts, expressing an Indian Landschape. In the Sea were several Islands, and a far off a Continent terminating with the Horizon. Out of a Creek came waving forth a Barque of an Antique design, adorn'd with Sculpture finishing in Scrowles, that on the Poope had for Ornament a great masque head of a Sea-God; and all the rest enrich'd with embost work touch'd with silver and gold. In the midst of this Barque sat Orpheus with his Harp, he wore a white Robe girt, on his shoulders (was tyed with a knot) a Mantle of Carnation, and his head crown'd with a Laurel Garland: with him, other persons in habits of Seamen, as Pilots and Guiders of the Barque, he playing one strain, was answered with the voyces and Instruments of the Brachmani joyn'd with the Priests of the Temple of Love, in extravagant habits sorting to their titles: whilst this Barque moved gently on the Sea, heaving and setting, and sometimes rowling, arrived near to the farther shore, it turn'd and return'd to the port from whence it came. The Song of the Brachmani, in Answer to Orpheus his Harp. 1 Heark! Orpheus is a Seaman grown, No winds of late have rudely blown, Nor waves their troubled heads advance! His Harp hath made the winds so mild, They whisper now as reconcil'd, The waves are sooth'd into a dance. 2 See how the list'ning Dolphins play! And willingly mistake their way, As when they heard Arions straines! Whom once their scaly Ancestor, Convay'd upon his back to shore, And took his musick for his pains. 3 We Priests that burn Loves Sacrifice, Our Orpheus greet with ravish'd eyes; For by this calmnesse we are sure, His Harp doth now prepare the way, That Indamora's voyage may Be more delightful, and secure. 4 And now th' inchanted mists shall clear, And Loves true Temple straight appear, (Long bid from men by sacred power,) Where noble Virgins still shall meet, And breath their Orizons, more sweet Than is the Springs ungather'd flower. The Barque having taken port, the Masquers appear in a Maratime Chariot, made of a spungie Rockstuff mixt with shels, Sea-weeds, Corral, and Pearl, born upon an Axletree with golden wheels without a rimme, with flat spokes like the blade of an Ore comming out of the Naves. This Chariot was drawn by Seamonsters, and floated with a sweet motion in the Sea: Indamora Queen of Narsinga, sate enthron'd in the highest part of this Chariot, in a rich seat, the back of which was a great Skallpo Shell. The habit of the Masquers was of Isabella Colour, and Watchet, with Bases in large panes cut through, all over richly embroidered with silver, and the dressing of their heads was of silver, with small falls of white feathers tipp'd with Watchet. This sight thus moving on the water, was accompanied with the Musick and Voyces of the Chorus. 1 She comes! each Princess in her traine hath all That wise enamor'd Poets, beauty call! So fit and ready to subdue: That had they not kind hearts which take a care To free, and counsel, whom their eyes ensnare, Poor Lovers would have cause to rue. 2 More welcome than the wandring Sea-mans star, When in the Night the Winds make causeless war, Until his Barque so long is tost, That's sayles to ragges are blown; the Main-yeard beares Not sheet enough to wipe, and dry those tears He shed to see his Rudder lost. The Song ended, all the fore part of the Sea was in an instant turn'd to dry land, and Indamora with her Contributary Ladies descended into the room, and made their entry. Then for entermedium the Musick began again, and sung this Song. The SONG. 1 The Planets though they move so fast, Have power to make their swiftness last, But see, your strength is quickly gone! Yet move by sense and rules of Art, And each hath an immortal part, Which cannot tire, but they have none. 2 Let then your soft, and nimble feet Lead and in various figures meet Those stranger Knights, who though they came Seduc'd at first by false desire, You'le kindle in their breasts a fire Shall keep Love warm, yet not inflame. 3 At first they wear your beauties prize, Now offer willing Sacrifice Unto the Vertues of the mind, And each shall wear when they depart, A lawful though a loving heart, And wish you still both strict and kind. The Masquers having a while reposed, danced their second Dance, which ended, and the Queen being seated under the State by the King, the Sceæn was changed into the true temple of Chast Love; this Temple instead of Columnes had terms of young Satyrs bearing up the returns of Architrane Freeze and Coronice, all enrich'd of Gold-Smiths work, the farther part of the Temple running far from the eye was design'd of another kind of Architecture, with Pillasters, Neeches, and Statues, and in the midst a stately gate adorn'd with Colomns and their Ornaments, and a Frontispice on the top, all which seemed to be of burnish'd Gold. Into this Temple enters Sunesis and Thelema; Sunesis a man of a noble Aspect, and richly attir'd; his garment of Cloth of Gold reaching down below his knees, and girt with a tuck at the wast, with wide sleeves turn'd up; his mantle of Watchet fastned on both shoulders, and hanging long down behind, a Garland of Sinope on his head, with a flame of fire issuing out of it, his Buskins were yellow, wrought with Gold. Thelema a young woman in a Robe of changeable Silk, girt with several tucks, under her breast, and beneath her wast, and great leaves of silver about her shoulders hanging down to the midst of her Arm; upon her head a Garland of great Marigolds, and puffs of silver'd Lawn between. And at her shoulders were Angels wings, these sung this Dialogue, assisted by the Chori. The SONG. Sunesis and Thelema. Sunesis. Come melt thy soul in mine, that when unite, We may become one vertuous appetite. Thelema. First breath thine into me, thine is the part More heavenly, and doth more adorne the heart. Both. Thus mix'd, our love will ever be discreet, And all our thoughts and actions pure, When perfect Will, and strengthened Reason meet, Then Love's created to endure. Chorus. Were Heaven more distant from us, we would strive To reach't with Pray'rs to make this Union thrive. Whilst this Song continued, there came softly down from the highest part of the heaven a bright and transparent Cloud, which being come to the middle part of the Ayr it opened, and out of it came Amianteros, or Chast Love flying down, clad all in Carnation and White, and two Garlands of Laurel in one hand, and crown'd with another of the same; whilst he descended the Cloud closeth again and returns upwards, and is hidden in the heavens; Chast Love being come down to the earth, was accompanied by Sunesis and Thelema, Divine Poesie, Orpheus, and the rest of the Poets up to the State, the great Chorus following at a distance, where they sung this Song. The Song. Amianteros, or Chast Love. 1 Whilst by a mixture thus made one, Y' ar th' Emblem of my Deitie, And now you may in yonder Throne, The pattern of your Union see. 2 Softly as fruitfull showres I fall, And th' undiscern'd increase I bring, Is of more precious worth then all A plentuous Summer pays a Spring. 3 The benefit it doth impart, Will not the barren earth improve, But fructifie each barren heart, And give eternal growth to Love. Sunesis. To CHARLES the Mightiest and the Best, And to the Darling of his breast, (Who rule b' example as by power) May youthful blessings still increase, And in their Off-spring never cease, Till Time's too old to last an hower. Chorus. These wishes are so well deserv'd by thee, And thought so modest too by Destiny, That heaven hath seal'd the grant as a Decree. After which they all retire to the Scæne, and Indamora and her Ladies begin the Revels with the King and the Lords, which continue the most part of the night. Thus ended this Masque, which for the newness of the invention, variety of Scænes, Apparitions, and richness of habits was generally approved to be one of the most magnificent that hath been done in England.

The verse has been extracted from prose text. Sir, this short journey from my Princes Throne, Is meant in Embassie to you alone; To you, whom he receives not as his Guest, For you are both his Ornament and Feast. Although his Greatness is not taught to bow, His Subjects fear, he will do homage now, Which, he esteems no less'ning to his State, Since 'tis his Love decrees it, not his Fate. Nay more, his Message, moves so low, I fear, What sounds like tender Courtship in your ear, His jealous Barons will dislike, and cry, I am perverted to Disloyalty; Urge my Commission false, then tax me for An easie Traytor, no Ambassador. As if my words would pull his Empire down, Shorten his Scepter, and contract his Crown; Thus whisper'd by my fears, I must impart For Ceremony now, what is his heart, Though with content of Truth, I may report You have a num'rous Faction in his Court. This Pallace first, by sword, then law maintain'd His few, but mighty Ancestors have raign'd, Is consecrated yours; which he doth give, Not in regard he hath short time to live; For so, since his Successor is unknown, You take what is his Subjects, not his own, And what is a Surrender now, would be Receiv'd to morrow as a Legacv: If more of his free love, I should relate, They'd stile it homage in our jealous state. 1 Come shut our Temple and away, Our bold seditious God shall stay; We'll serve no sacrafice to day, Our humor is to Feast, not Pray. 2 The Battel which our Knights have won, Did last until th'amaz'd Sun For fear, did mend his usual pace, And set betimes to hide his face. 3 And now the story of their fight Is universal, as his light, Which Fame upon her swifter wing Hath early brought for us to sing. 1 Heark! heark! the trouble of the day draws near, And now the Drum doth teach the heart to beat, Whilst Trumpets cherish not, but wound the ear Of such, who are ordain'd for a defeat. Chorus. Heark! heark! some groan, and curse uncertain Fate, Which us for blood and ruine, doth create. 2 Charge! charge! cries ev'ry bold ambitious Knight, Whilst artificial darkness hid their way, The lightning of their Swords was all their light, For dust, and sulphrous clouds had chock'd the day Chorus. Heark! heark! some groan, and curse uncertain Fate, Which us for blood and ruine doth create. 3 Burn, burn, was straight the noyse in ev'ry Tent, Whilst some mis-led by their disorder'd fear, Did help to kindle what they should prevent, And scap'd the Van to perish in the Rear. Chorus. Heark! heark! some groan, and curse uncertain Fate, Which us for blood and ruine doth create. 4 Fly, fly, cryes then the tame dejected Foe, Each wondring at the terror which he feels, And in the hurry of their overthrow, Forsook their Arms, and trusted to their heels. Chorus. Heark! heark! some groan, and curse uncertain Fate, Which us for blood and ruine, doth create. 5 Stand! stand! was now the word our Knights did give, For weary of pursuit, they had no will To grace with death, who basely sought to live, As if unworthy of their pains to kill. Chorus. Heark! heark! some groan, and curse uncertain Fate, Which us for blood and ruine, doth create. 1 Whither so gladly, and so fast, As if you knew all danger past Of Combat, and of War? As you believ'd my arms were bound, Or when I shoot, still ev'ry wound I make is but a scar. 2 Arme now your brests with shields of steel, And plates of Brass, yet you shall feel My arrows are so keen, Like lightning that not hurts the Skin, Yet melts the solid parts within, They'l wound although unseen. 3 My Mother taught me long ago To aym my shafts, and draw my Bow When Mars she did subdue. And now you must resign to Love, Your warlike hearts, that she may prove Those antick Stories true. 1 Unarm! unarme! no more your fights Must cause the virgins tears, But such as in the silent nights, Spring rather from their fears. 2 Such diff'rence as when Doves do bill, Must now be all your strife: For all the blood that you shall spill, Will usher in a life. 3 And when your Ladies falsly coy Shall timerous appear, Believe, they then would fain enjoy What they pretend to fear. 4 Breath then each others Breath, and kiss Your soules to union: And whilst they shall injoy this bliss, Your bodies too, are one. 5 Too morrow will the hasty Sun Be fear'd more of each Lover, For hindring to repeat what's done, Than what it may discover. 1 Make room for our God too, make room, For now surpriz'd, and ravish'd with delight Apollo is from Delphos come, T'inspire, and breath himself in every Knight. 2 His God-head is inclin'd to prove How justly proud, and happy you will be, When with the powers of War and Love, He shall unite his wiser Deity. 3 Then still, as if not made of Earth, Express your thankfulness in active pleasure. Whilst you design your hearts to Mirth, Your ears to numbers, and your feet to measure. 1 Behold, how this conjunction thrives! His radiant beams Apollo strives So much to strengthen and increase, As growth and verdure nere should cease. 2 Come you industrious slaves of plenty, bring All that is hop'd for in an Eastern Spring: Or all that Autumne yields, when she doth pay Those promis'd hopes where 'tis perpetual day. 3 Come strew this ground (delay us not with s[illeg.]owth) Strew till we walk on sweet Cicilian Flowres, To prove how Seeds have hastned in their growth, Drop Indian Fruits, as thick as April showres. The Song of Valediction, after the Banquet. Priests of Mars.
