      <field name="fulltext">My muse, though hamely in attire, May touch the heart. Burns. VENETIAN SERENADE. Oh! linger not, love; for the beams of the moon Are lighting our path o'er the glassy lagoon; The yellow sand sparkles like gold on the shore; And ripples of silver are laving my oar. Night reigns o'er the world with her gem-crested brow, And mirrors her stars in the waters below; The air is delicious, with spice-breathing flowers, That pour forth their odours from fairy-wrought bowers. 'Tis just such an hour when, with those whom we love, The soul might forget there's a heaven above; In a moment so precious, so blissfully dear, The wrapt spirit might fancy that heaven was here. FRAGMENT. Say on, that I'm over romantic, In loving the wild, and the free; But, the waves of the dashing Atlantic, The Alps, and the eagle, for me! The billows, so madly uprearing Their heads on the blast-ridden main, Mock the hurricane, dauntless, unfearing, And roar back the thunder again. The mountain, right heavenward bearing, Half lost in the sun and the snow, Can only be trod by the daring: The fearful may tremble below. The eagle is high in its dwelling, For ever the tameless, the proud; It heeds not the storm-spirits' yelling, It swoops through the lightning-fraught cloud. Tell me not of a soft sighing lover; Such things may be had by the score: I'd rather be bride to a rover, And polish the rifle he bore. The storm, with its thunder affrighting; The torrent and avalanche high; These, these, would my spirit delight in; 'Mid these would I wander and die! Say on, that I'm over romantic, In loving the wild and the free; But the waves of the dashing Atlantic, The Alps, and the eagle, for me! LINES WRITTEN TO BEGUILE AN IDLE HOUR. How fondly memory loves to nurse The happy scenes of bygone years; When childhood drank the cup of life, Before 'twas dash'd with care and tears; When infancy, just thrown away, Left me a wild and sportive girl, With glowing cheek and thoughtless brow, Half hid 'neath many a shaggy curl; When time flew on with rainbow wings, Flinging a radiance round the hours When peeping daisies seem more bright Than Italy's Arcadian flowers. Methinks I see the old oak tree, That stands alone upon the hill, Whose acorns, strung beneath its shade, Keep place among my treasures still. Methinks I see my tiny boat, With silken pennon, long and gay, Now drifting on the weedy bank,— Now deluged in the cascade's spray. How fearless then my footstep trod The plank that spann'd the torrent's flow; As light and active in my spring As playful greyhound on the snow. How oft I rambled through the wood, Or paced along the new turn'd furrow; How pleased I urged my yelping dog To start the rabbit from its burrow. The tangled copses round about Appear'd familiar with my tread; The glitt'ring adder linger'd still; The chirping linnet scarcely fled. Oh! those were happy, laughing days; Such that I never thought would leave A pensive shadow in my breast, Or give my heart a cause to grieve. To grieve that those who used to be My fondest, truest playmates then, Should sadly change, since mingled with The world, its manners, and its men. To think I cannot meet a hand So warm as those I press'd in youth; To find the friendship proffer'd now Has more of treachery than truth. To know that then in innocence I breathed the prayer and bent my knee; Laying my heart where altars blaze With mercy's incense, pure and free. And now to turn with blushing shame, And find a guilty stain within, Which darkly tells how much that heart Hath learnt of folly and of sin. Oh! there's a feeling undefined, Which no philosophy can smother— There is one string more finely tuned Within my breast than any other. 'Tis that which rises keenly mute; 'Tis that which memory plays upon When, lurking near some former haunt, I muse, companionless, alone. There seems a halo round the spot, A mystic spell of joy and sorrow; A pensive luxury of thought, The soul from nowhere else can borrow. But hold, my pen, thou'rt growing tired Of this dull, moralizing strain; I'll lay thee down, but still must wish That I could be a child again. HE LED HER TO THE ALTAR. He led her to the altar, But the bride was not his chosen: He led her, with a hand as cold, As though its pulse had frozen. Flowers were crush'd beneath his tread, A gilded dome was o'er him; But his brow was damp, and his lips were pale, As the marble steps before him. His soul was sadly dreaming Of one he had hoped to cherish; Of a name and form that the sacred rites, Beginning, told must perish. He gazed not on the stars and gems Of those who circled round him; But trembled as his lips gave forth The words that falsely bound him. Many a voice was praising, Many a hand was proferr'd; But mournfully he turn'd him From the greeting that was offer'd. Despair had fixed upon his brow Its deepest, saddest token; And the bloodless cheek, the stifled sigh, Betray'd his heart was broken. MY NATIVE HOME. I'm back again! I'm back again! My foot is on the shore; I tread the bright and grassy plain Of my native home once more. My early love! my early love! Oh! will she love me now? With a darken'd tinge upon my cheek, And scars upon my brow. Yes, that she will! yes, that she will! The flame her youth confess'd Will never lack its warmth, within Her pure and constant breast. I'm back again! I'm back again! My foot is on the shore; I tread the bright and grassy plain Of my native home once more. My early friend! my early friend! Oh! will he stretch his hand, To welcome back the wanderer To his long forsaken land? Yes, that he will! yes, that he will! The vow in boyhood spoken, The vow so fond, so true as ours, Can ne'er be lightly broken. Hail, native clime! hail, native clime! Land of the brave and free! Though long estranged, thy exile ranged, His heart comes back to thee. I'm back again! I'm back again! My foot is on the shore; I tread the bright and grassy plain Of my native home once more. THE LAST LOOK. Long, long had he waned from life, but now Strange faintness drain'd his breath; An icy paleness stole to his brow— The shadow of coming death. He gazed around the little room Where his happiest hours had been spent, Conning the page of poet and sage, Or holding merriment: He felt he was dying, and calmly took A sad, a long, last farewell look. He threw a glance on all he prized— A glance that was glazing and dim: He mark'd the lute unstrung and mute, To be woke no more by him: He dwelt where the precious volumes lay— Those treasures of pure delight, That had charm'd away the lonely day, And solaced the sleepless night— Cherish'd till they had form'd a part Of idols closest to his heart. He raised his eye, with a gentle sigh, To the picture-blazon'd wall, And his father's portrait met him there, The dearest thing of all! He fix'd his gaze, and a tremour pass'd, Betraying some sudden pain: His dark lids fell; that look was the last! He raised them not again: He gasp'd, and murmur'd falteringly, “Tis o'er; now lead me forth to die!” But the sand was out, his drooping head Sunk heavily on his breast; The chord had snapp'd, and his soul had fled Where “the weary are at rest!” Years have gone by, but memory still E'er yields to his spirit's claim; My cheek will whiten, my eye will fill, To hear his whisper'd name; For the moment passes when he took His last, that long, that dying look. STANZAS. [My joy, my hopes, let others share] My joy, my hopes, let others share: In grief I'd play the miser's part; My lips, my brow, should never bear The index of a stricken heart. If riches were consign'd to me, No griping hand would clutch the pelf; For valueless the gold would be If hoarded only for myself. If pleasure's cheering rays were mine, I would not bask in selfish light, But have the circle spread and shine, And make all round as glad and bright. But should my spirit bend and ache Beneath some pressing load of woe, Unheard the heavy sigh must break, Unseen the scalding drop must flow! With sudden stroke or wearing pain The barb might pierce, the worm might feed: I'd cloak the wound, I'd hide the chain— In secret weep—in silence bleed. For did my troubled breast reveal Its anguish to the world's wide ear, The few would grieve, partake, and feel— The many would not care to hear. And could I bear the few, the loved, To make my fears and sorrows theirs! Could I e'er wish a bosom moved To note and mourn my doubts and cares! 'Twere easier far to inly groan, And let the canker rankle deep; Better the worst of pangs my own Than see a dear one watch and weep! And who among the busy throng Would heed my words or mark my tear? The saddest tale, the foulest wrong, Might raise a smile or call a sneer. Oh! well I know, whate'er my fate, I'd meet and brook it firmly proud, And rather die beneath the weight Than tell it to the soulless crowd. Joy, hope, and wealth, let others share; In grief I'd play the miser's part: I'd scatter all that's sweet and fair, But lock the nightshade in my heart. MY BIRTHDAY. Mother, there's no soft hand comes now To smooth the dark curls o'er my brow; I hear no voice so low and mild As that which breathed “my own loved child.” No smile will greet, no lips will press, No prayer will rise, no words will bless, So fond, so dear, so true for me As those I ever met from thee. Oh! that my soul could melt in tears, And die beneath the pain it bears; The grief that springs, the thoughts that goad, Become a heavy madd'ning load; For all that heart and memory blends But hotly scathes and sorely rends; And feeling, with its biting fangs, Tortures with sharp and bleeding pangs. My Mother! thou didst prophecy With sighing tone and weeping eye That the cold world would never be A kindred resting place for me. Oh, thou wert right! I cannot find One sympathetic link to bind, But where some dark alloy comes in To mar with folly, wrong, or sin. My Mother! thou didst know full well My spirit was not fit to dwell With crowds who dream not of the ray That burns the very soul away. That ray is mine; 'tis held from God, But scourges like a blazing rod, And never glows with fiercer flame Than when 'tis kindled at thy name. My Mother! thou art remembered yet With doting love and keen regret; My birthday finds me once again In fervent sorrow, deep as vain. Thou art gone for ever, I must wait The will of Heaven, the work of fate. And faith can yield no hope for me Brighter than that of meeting thee. STANZAS. [They told me, in my earlier years] They told me, in my earlier years, Life was a dark and tangled web; A gloomy sea of bitter tears, Where sorrow's influx had no ebb. But such was vainly taught and said, My laugh rung out with joyous tone; The woof possess'd one brilliant thread, Of rainbow colours, all my own. They talk'd of trials, sighs, and grief, And call'd the world a wilderness, Where dazzling bud or fragrant leaf But rarely sprung to cheer and bless. But there was one dear precious flower Engrafted in my bosom's core, Which made my home an Eden bower, And caused a doubt if heaven held more. I boasted—till a mother's grave Was heap'd and sodded—then I found The sunshine stricken from the wave, And all the golden thread unwound. Where was the flower I had worn So fondly, closely, in my heart? The bloom was crush'd, the root was torn, And left a cureless, bleeding part. Preach on who will—say “Life is sad,” I'll not refute as once I did; You'll find the eye that beam'd so glad Will hide a tear beneath its lid. Preach on of woe; the time hath been I'd praise the world with shadeless brow: The dream is broken.—I have seen A mother die: I'm silent now. LINES TO THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND. Lady, perchance my untaught strain May little suit a royal ear; But I would break my lyre in twain Ere aught it yield be insincere. There's been enough of dulcet tone To praise thy charms and greet thy youth; But I, though standing by thy throne, Would proudly dare to sing the truth. I cannot join the minstrel throng Who pour idolatrous pretence; Because I deem such fulsome song Must sadly pall upon thy sense. Thou art a star, whose leading light Must beacon through a stormy way: Shine out, and, if thou guid'st aright, Our hearts will bless the saving ray. If thou would'st walk a better path Than regal steps have chiefly trod, So sway thy sceptre, that it hath Some glorious attributes of God. Peace, mercy, justice, mark His reign, And these should dwell with all who rule; Beware! resist the poison bane Of tyrant, knave, or courtier fool. Thou hast been train'd by goodly hand To fill thy place of mighty care; And Heaven forbid that faction's band Should turn our hopes to blank despair. Lean on thy people, trust their love, Thou'lt never find a stronger shield; The “toiling herd” will nobly prove What warm devotion they can yield. Remember, much of weal or woe To millions, rest alone with thee; Be firm, and let Old England show A nation happy, wise, and free. STANZAS. [I've track'd the paths of the dark wild wood] I've track'd the paths of the dark wild wood, No footfall there but my own; I've linger'd beside the moaning flood, But I never felt alone. There were lovely things for my soul to meet, Rare work for my eye to trace: I held communion close and sweet With a Maker—face to face. I have sat in the cheerless, vacant room, At the stillest hour of night, With nought to break upon the gloom But the taper's sickly light; And there I have conjured back again The loved ones, lost and dead, Till my swelling heart and busy brain Have hardly deem'd them fled. I may rove the waste or tenant the cell, But alone I never shall be; While this form is a home where the spirit may dwell, There is something to mate with me. Wait till ye turn from my mindless clay, And the shroud o'er my breast is thrown, And then, but not till then, ye may say, That I am left alone! SAY, OH! SAY, YOU LOVE ME! By the gloom that shades my heart, When, fair girl, from thee I part; By the deep impassioned sigh, Half suppress'd when thou art nigh; By the heaving of my breast, When thy hand by mine is press'd; By these fervent signs betray'd; Canst thou doubt my truth, sweet maid? Then say, oh! say, you love me! By the joy that thrills my frame, To hear another praise thy name; By my mingled dread the while, Lest that one should woo thy smile; By the flush that dyes my cheek, Telling what I ne'er could speak; By these fervent signs betray'd, Canst thou doubt my truth, sweet maid? Then say, oh! say, you love me! Heart and soul, more fond than mine, Trust me, never can be thine; Heart and soul, whose passion pure, Long as life shall thus endure. Take, oh! take me, let me live On the hope thy smiles can give; See me kneel before my throne; Take, oh! take me, for thine own, And say, oh! say, you love me! FILL MY GLASS, BOY, FILL UP TO THE BRIM! Fill my glass, boy; fill up to the brim! Here's to thee, dear, my life and my love; Though thy truant one roved from thy side for awhile, He's return'd to thee fond as a dove. I've wander'd, and sportively sought For another, like Venus and thee; But found I had look'd on the sun too long, For aught else to be bright to me. Like Adam, I mournfully sigh'd, To get back to my Eden of bliss; For there's nought half so radiant on earth as thy smile, Nor so sweet as the fruit of thy kiss. Like the mate of the glow worm, I found I had left one so brilliant behind, That backward I flew, lest the gem should be lost, Which a sultan right gladly would find. And truly I turn to thine eye, As the Mussulman turns to the flame; And the faith I this moment so zealously hold, Shall in death, love, continue the same. Fill my glass, boy; fill up to the brim! Here's to thee, dear, my life and my love; Though thy truant one rov'd from thy side for awhile, He's return'd to thee fond as a dove.</field>
