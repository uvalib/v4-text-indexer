I. 10 (In an early XVI-cent. hand, at the end of Hardyng's Chronicle) Here begynnyth a lamentable complaynt of our saviour cryst kyng eternall to sinfull mane his brother naturall. Brother, a-byde, I the desire and pray; A-byde, a-byde and here thy brother speke. Be-holde my body in this blody aray, Broysed &amp; betyne wyth whippis that wold not breke. This ferefull force, this wo, this wrongfull wreke, ffor the I sufferd, what canst thou do, then, lesse agayne, But stonde a while and harke how I complayne? A-bove the sterrys, in hevyne emperiall, Crouned, I satte, thi lorde and thi soverayne, Servide wyth bodies of nature ymmortall, In Ioyes that euer shall endure &amp; remayn. hevyn, erth, &amp; hell, and all thei contayne, To me dyde owe dewe obedyence, As to theyr prynce, most hygh in excellence. I raynyng thus in full felicite, Thou lyveddyst in erth, subiecte to the fende, Wrappyd in wo &amp; grett aduersite, Woyde of socoure, woyde of comforde for any ffrende. And worst of all, thou knewest no tyme nor ende Off thy distresse; thou knewest no remedy A-gaynst thy greffe and mortall mysery. Pety I hade, beholdyng the this wise Be thin enmy oppresside, in distresse; And, of grett love, a-noone, I dyd devise The to delyuer out of this wrechidnese. And by and by, with-out longe procese, I lefte my trone and regall mageste And hither I came, a maydyns childe to be. Borne in bedlem, lappyd and laide in strawe Ine a powur howse wher bestys ete ther mete, Brought to the temple after the Iues lawe And circumcysedâthis ys not to forgette,â I lede my yought wyth children in the strette, Poorly a-rayed in clothes bare and thyne, Suche as my mother for me dyde make &amp; spyne. Myn age encresed, &amp; then a-bought I wentt, Prechinge scripture; &amp; wher-sumeuer I came I movyd the people for to be penitent, And that I saied, was in my fathers name. Some praysed my preching, some said I was to blame, Some toke my techyng, sum wold nott of my scole, Sum held me wyse, some said I was a fole. Thus longe I lyvid, passyng frome place to place, Bare-fotyd, caplese, wythout syluer or gold. Payne of my traveylle a-pered in my face; Men myght perceyve yf thei listed to be-hold. Watch &amp; grett labur, sharpe honger, thurst &amp; cold ffull ofte me brought so feble &amp; so lowe, That myne owne mother sum tyme dyd me not knowe. Thus, &amp; mych more, for the endured I. Therfor, brother, make thou no hast to starte Nother of my speche be thou no-thing wery, ffor yf thou be, to blame thou arte. To whom shuld I disclose or brek myne harte, To whom shulde I complayne my greffe mortall, but to the, my brother most naturall? Harke now therfor! hark now, &amp; take goode hede, And of my troble a-noone thou shalt here more To shewe my-self as god &amp; mane in deede, lasar I raysed, buried fowre dayes be-fore. The people I cured of euery maner soreâ Some deffe, some dome, sum full of dropsy, And some sore enhawnted wyth ferefull frensy, And some-lame, of lidernes Ã¾at myght not goo nor crepe, And sum blynde borne, by ympedyment of nature, And some vexed, they cowde nevyr reste ne slepe, And sum that fell dede by sodene adventure. Bothe powur &amp; ryche I holpe &amp; toke to cure, Vsyng to them noone other medycyne But my holy worde, full of vertue divyne. Then myn enmys begane to rage &amp; rayle, And said I hade the devyll at my demayne; Some said I vsed arte magike wythought fayle, And some said I coude not longe contynew ne rayne. Al this I hard and litle I said a-gayne; All that myne ennymes dyd I sufferd paciently, And to ther wordis no countraury speche hade I. Then they came to me, flamed wyth Ire fervent, And said the people by me deceyvid were. Many blynd reasons &amp; miche froward argument To me they made, and bade I shuld answere. Answere I dyde, wher-to they leyed good ere, And specyally thei gave sure attendance, To take me wyth some fawlte in vtturaunce. But to my saying they cowde no-thyng replye; My resouns wer so playne and apparentte. Never-the-lesse, so miche was ther envy, That styll they murmorde &amp; wold not be contente. Cownsell they toke and, by secrett assentte, They were a-greed to dethe me for to bete, Wyth cloddys of erthe &amp; stone hard &amp; grette. I me wyth-drewe &amp; dyde lette theire fury passe And, for a seasone, fro them I dyd me hyde. Neuerthelese, a-gayn a-brode I wase, All there malys redy for to abyde. And by this tyme thei had gotene them a gydeâ One that I trustyd, &amp; Iudas was his nameâ Which me betrayed &amp; hynge hyme-self for shame. Then, to conclude ther cruell appetyght, Thei gatherd them in a great companye, Wyth byllys &amp; battys, wyth torch &amp; lanterne lyght, me to dystresse; and so takyne was I, And leede to prysoun wyth clamor &amp; ought-cry, ffast bownde in roppys, &amp; left my-self aloneâ ffor all my frendis were fro me flede &amp; goone. Petur, my frend, that said wyth wordis bolde In my quarell he wolde bothe lyve &amp; dye, Stode by the fyere to warme hyme-self for colde, And for his master thrise he dyde me di-nye. Thus was I lefte no frende to stande me by, Thus was I lefte in fere and grett danger, A-monge myn enymys a wofull prisoner. Be-fore pylate erly they dyd me brynge, He as a Iuge, to here what shuld be sayde. And too stode forth, a-gaynst me witnessyng, And a fals mattur vnto my charge they layde. âSpeke, manne,â qd pylate, âhow ys thy lyf convayed?â And wyth that worde, wattur to whasche he callde, And I stode styll, seke and sore appalled. Then sodenly the folke feelle in roure, And wyth one voyce they cryed, âhang vp this theff!â Pylate stode forth &amp; openly he swoure He cowde lay no-thyng to my repreff. Neuer-the-lesse, fering his propur greeff, And wyllyng also noyse to a-pease &amp; stylle, He badde them take &amp; do wyth me ther wyll. Then they layde hande &amp; lede me forth that day, Wyth shotyng &amp; crying, wyth mokry &amp; mych dysdayne; Some pulled me forwarde &amp; tare my powur a-ray, And by the here some plukkyd me bake a-gayne. Often I stomelled &amp; felle to the grounde for payne And, wythout pyte of my grevance or hurte, They spornned me vp, all betrodene in durte. And, as people most cruell &amp; vnkynde, When I for woo blode &amp; water swette, Vnto a pylar nakyd thei dyde me bynde And wyth sharpe scorgis thei dyde my body bette Vnto the bonnesâthe synues dyd freeteâ And on my heode sharpe thorns thei dyd dystayne Thorowgh skyne &amp; skulle, that rane vnto my brayne. Thus bete, thus rentte, and all to-tore, Wyth a great crose thei dyd me charge &amp; lade, Which on my shuldure vp to an hill I bore, In steppys of blode as depe as I cowde wade. A-bowt me rennyng, myche tyrany thei made, And as wood men thei dyde me dryve &amp; chace, Wyth mobbys &amp; knockys &amp; spettyng in my face. This crosse soo sade a-pone my shulder ley That bake &amp; bone it made to bowe &amp; bende. Often I stomeled, &amp; fell downe by the way As I labored the mounteyn to ascende; When I came vp my breth was at an ende, I cowde not speke, in me no powur ther was, But as in a mane redy for to passe. Then one this crosse thei dyde me strecch &amp; strayn, And nayled me faste wyth naylles gret &amp; longe, And hyng me vppe betwene false thevis twayne, Most shamefully, wyth moche rebuke &amp; wronge. I called for drynke, my thurst was grevous strong; Thei gave me aysell, tempred wyth bitter galle, Which I did taste &amp; dranke therof but smalle. My visage changed to pale &amp; blew as byse, My fleshe be-ganne to styff &amp; waxid drye, My hart lokyd lyke a plomett of Ise, My lyff was spent, myne owre was come to dye. Vnto my father I cryed, âheli, heli!â And wyth that worde, I layde myne hede a-syde, And dolfully gave vp the spret &amp; dyed. Ther honge I dede, a pytefull fygure, And mene in harnesse were sette the place to kepe, And, by-cawse of me thei wold be sure, Wyth a sharpe spere my hart thei lawnsed depe. My mother stode, but what cowde she doo but weepe? And weepe she dyde, terrys both whight &amp; rede, Wrynging her handys, &amp; fill downe by me deede. Now, gentyll brother, be-holde this matur welle, And myndfully make this rufull reknynge, Loke one this processe, consider it euery delle fro the furst to the laste, consider euery thynge: ffurst, consider I raynyd as a kynge; Seconde, considere, as a frend moost fre To make the ryche, I died in pouerte. What cowde one brother more for a-nother doo Then my complaynte presently dothe a-pere &amp; expresse? What canst thou adde, or putte eny thyng Ã¾er-too, That myght be done by brotherly kyndnesse? Se what I suffred, thy grevanse to reddresse! What canst thou aske or more desire of me, Thy feythfull brother, dyeng in pouerte? Off tendure love, all this I dyd endure; Love dyde me lede, love dyde me thus constrayne; And, for my dede &amp; grevouse adventure, More aske I nott but love for love a-gayne. Brother, be kynde, &amp; for a good certayne, by-side all this, rewardede shalt thou be in the blysse of hevyne, where ther ys no pouerte. 110. âHave All My Heart and Be in Peaceâ Trinity Coll.

Bodley 850 (Sum. Catal. No. 2604) O blissed god, Ã¾at art al-mi?ti, Ã¾u arte ful of goodnesse, euer full of mercy. how curteys and howe mercyfull Ã¾u art to mankynde, how louly &amp; piteful, may no man haue mynde. for mankynde thowe tokist both flesshe and blood, of Ã¾e blessed virgyne mary, which euer was meke and good. for this good and many oÃ¾er, I thanke Ã¾e, mekely euermore seyng hertly, mercy &amp; gramercy! With hard peynes Ã¾u woldist by us vpone Ã¾e rode tre, but many dispites and reproues Ã¾u sofredist for me, Angry wer the wordis which Ã¾u sofred for mane; But angeryer were Ã¾e betyng Ã¾en I may tell or kan. A pytefull Ih?, in peynes blessed mote Ã¾u be, Ã¾at Ã¾u woldist such dyseases sofre so for me. Lo! ih?, I can non oÃ¾er but lift vp myn hert only, and euer sey with louly chere, mercy and gramercy! Thyne hede Ã¾u bowdist all a-downe to here me full mekely, Thowe spreddist thyn armes all a-brode to take me to mercy, Thowe schewdist thyn hert thurgh Ã¾i syde vpone Ã¾e rode tre. Thi blissed loue Ã¾u graunte vs, Ã¾at euer is so fre. In tokne Ã¾u wilt wissche vs, in dedes and in thou?tis, To Ã¾e crosse Ã¾i fete were nayled, whith greet and full sore peynes. A! good ih?, what schall I sey to Ã¾e, Ã¾at art so goodly? But euer I cry nowe louly, mercy and gramercy! ?it lorde almi?t, blessed mote Ã¾u be! ffor many are Ã¾e benefetys Ã¾at Ã¾u haste yeuene to me, ffor ri?t wittys and ri?t lemys, my lyfelode also, ffull many oÃ¾er vertues and ?iftes many moo. But sori may I be, if I spend not deuli All thise ?iftes ?euen to me freli. And, lord, to ?eue mercy euer Ã¾u arte redy, Therfor trustly I sey, mercy and gramercy! Witte and kunnynge haue I none, Ã¾at goodnesse for to telle, Howe plentefull Ã¾i mercy is, may no man rede ne spelle. To them is mercy nedefull Ã¾at haue Ã¾e falsely serued, As seruauntis vnkynde, which haue them-selfe deceyued. But nowe, for Ã¾er is none so vntryisty, so vnthende, I hope, as I, To Ã¾e I ?elde me gylty, for euer I hope in mercy. To be to the a trewe seruaunt, With bitter deth Ã¾u bou?tist me, And in thi seruyce recheles, fals and vnthende I a[m] to Ã¾e. A mercyfull ih?, what shall I, suche a wrecche, Ã¾en do? That haue ben so synfull, so proude and wykkyde also. But though I be wrecchyd, ?it I clepe and cry To Ã¾e, almi?ti ih?, for euer I hope of mercy. I haue also misspendede my witt, Ã¾u hast ?eue to me, With many dyuers thou?tis, I haue ofte misplesede Ã¾e. What Ã¾u hast me forbode, Ã¾at haue I do; A?enst, lorde, Ã¾i commandementis I haue done also. ffor all thise defautis, peynes though I be worthi, ?it, lord, shewe me grace, for euer I hope in mercy. Synned I haue in pride, wrath &amp; enuy, In slouthe of Ã¾i seruice, couetyse, gloteny &amp; lechery. ffor thise synnes and oÃ¾er moo, If ri?t dome should be do, As a wrecche as I am, euer I shoulde dwelle in woo. But mercyfull iuge, to yeue grace euer Ã¾u art redy, I put me therfor in Ã¾i dome, for euer I hope of mercy. A pyteful ih?, longe tyme it were, I wote well, my synnes, my freelte, to shewe Ã¾e nowe euery dell, Also, lord, sith it is so that all thyng is knowe to the, ffor the may no thyng be hidde, priuy or pert wheÃ¾er it be, But ?it, lord, whath cometh to mynde, To Ã¾e I knowleche mekely. ffor thoughe a wrecche I haue bene, ?it I hope of mercy. Nowe, lord, I haue shewed Ã¾e my freelte &amp; synnes all; To Ã¾e, crist, good ih?, wepynge I crye and calle. Though thus falsely I haue lyuede, nowe me repent sore. What I Ã¾e pray with sorouful hert, grawnt me nowe gostly, ffor euermore, lorde ih? crist, trustly I hope in mercy. Grace nowe me grawnte my synnes to forsake, And fro hens forward neuer them to take. But euer in leuyng, by ny?t and day, What is to thi plesyng and most to thi pay, That geue me grace to do to my lyues ende. And when I shall hens goo, to thi blisse Ã¾u me sende. And though I turne a?en to synne, as euer Ã¾e flesshe is redy, ?it graunt me Ã¾at I hope to wynn, good ih?, thy mercy. Nowe, lord, for hem Ã¾at ben deed, mercy I aske dewly, And for hem whiche ledde her lyfe ofte also synfully. ffast for Ã¾i modir loue, and oÃ¾er that be in blisse, To me, synfull, and alle oÃ¾er, A ri?t wey Ã¾u vs wisse. And, good lorde, suffre thow vs oure tyme not for to spille, But euer, ihesu, to do Ã¾at what is Ã¾i wille. Graunt vs also in oure ende to take thi sacramentis worthily, and oure synnes forsake, And Ã¾en to dye with full feythe, With mekenesse and chastite, ffrom hens Ã¾u graunt vs to wende with charite. To Ã¾e soules whiche mercy abyde, in peynes ful strong, Graunt hem, lorde, som remedy for they thynke wel longe. And though they be in peynes strong, ?it mercy they hope to haue, And aftir Ã¾er sorowes they hope Ã¾at thowe wilte hem saue. Therfore lorde of pyte, ih?, Ã¾at dydest one Ã¾e tree, Sore sighyng, I pray to the with bitter teris, as Ã¾u mayste see. Besechynge also mekely, nowe for oure synnes we be sory, That fully what we hope, trustely graunt vs Ã¾at graciously. Ih? Ã¾at art almi?ti, Nowe and euer, Ã¾i mercy. Amen, ih?s. 143. O Redeemer, Purge Me of My Vices MS. Douce 1 (Sum. Catal. No. 21575) O glorius god, redemer of mankynde, whiche on the crosse hyng full of compassyon, Graunt of thi grace, within my herte and mynde Holly to remember the armes of thy passion. Enrote, good lorde, thi greuous paynes stronge, Depe in my thought, auoydynge all synne, and purge the vyces Ã¾at hathe ben in me longe, with contrite herte these verses to begynne. Enclyne alowe, of mercy, now thyne ere, Contemplynge thy paynes, vnto my peticion, And graunt me grace so to serue the here, Affter this lyfe to be in thi tuycion. Amen. 144.

Thus Edward seyth, for latt I was kyng; xxiij?? yeres I reynyd this ymperiall, Som men to plesoure, and som men nott to lykyng. fforgefnes I aske fore my nyse doyng, What A-vaylyÃ¾e it yov to be my foo? I may nott Resiste nor Amend your compleynynge, Quia ecce nunc in puluere dormio. I ly now in mowlde as it ys naturall, ffore erthe vnto erthe hath his Reuerture; What ordeyned god to be terrestyall Wyth Recourse off erthly nature. Euyre ffor-to lyve who may be swre? What is hit to trust the mutabilite Off this world whan no thyng may endure? I am now gon wych latt was in prosperite, To presumen there vpon hit ys butt vaniteâ No sertayne butt a chery fere full of wooâ Reynyd I nott latt in greet feli[ci]te? Et ecce nunc in puluere dormio. Where was in my lyff such one as I Whiles my fortune had here continuaunce? Grauntyd nott sho to me the vyctorie, In ynglond to Reygne and to contrybute fraunce? Sho tok me by the hond and led me the daunce, And with hure sewger lyppus on me she smylyd; And for here dyssemblande countenaunce I cowd nott be ware tyll I was begylyd. Owtt off this lond sho hath [me] exylyd, Whan I was lothest hens for to goo And I in age, as who seyth, butt a child, Ecce nunc in puluere dormio. I se well they lyve that dowbyll my yerys; Thus this world delyth with me as hit lyst, And hath me made, to yov that byn my perys, Example to take euyre off had-I-wyst. I stored hucches, cofers and chyst With tresore takyng off my commynalteâ ffore there tresore that I toke there prayers I mystâ Now whom I be-sech with pore humylyte Off forgefnesse, off me to haue pite. I was youre kyng and kepte yow from youre foo; I wold a-mend, butt now hit woll nott bee, Quia ecce nunc in puluere dormio. I had Inogthe, I hyld nott me content, With-outt Remembraunce that I schuld dy, More to encresse was myne entent. Beyng nott warre who schuld occupy, I mad the towre strong, butt I wyst nott why, Nore to whom I purchased tatersall; I amendyd dovere one the mowntayne hy, And provokyd london to fortefye Ã¾er wall, I made notynghame a place Ryall, Wynsore and etton &amp; many odur moo, Westmynster &amp; elthamâyit went I from all, Quia ecce nunc in puluere dormio. Where is my gret conquest &amp; vy[c]tory? Where be my Rentis &amp; my Ryall aray? Where be my coursors &amp; my horsys so hy? Where is my grett plesure, solas &amp; play? As vanite to nou?te all ys gon away. Lidy besse, for me long may ye call, Whe be departyd vntyll domus day! I lovyd you, lady, my souerayne ouerall. Where be my byldyngis &amp; my castellis Ryall? Butt Wynsore off them I haue noo moo And off etton ther prayers perpetuall, Quia ecce nunc in puluere dormio. Whi schuld ye be prowde &amp; presume so hy? Sent Barnard doth Ã¾er-off nobly trete, Seyng a man ys butt a sake of stercory And schall Retorne to wormys mette. What cam off Alysaunder the grett? And off strong samson who can tell? Were nott wormys ordeynyd Ã¾er fleshe for to frett? And Salamon, that off wytt was the well, And absolon, proferyd his here forto sellâ ffor all his beavtes wormys hym ette also. And I, latte Edward, that dyd excelle, Ecce nunc in puluere dormio. I haue pleyd my pagent &amp; now am I past, I wyll Ã¾at ye wytt I was off no grett elde. Butt all thing consumeth att the last, Whan deth apperith lost ys the feld. Sith this world no lenger vp-held Mo, conservyd to me my place. In manus tuas, domine, my spryte vp I yeld; Humbley I be-sech the off thy grace! And ye, corteys commyners, with your hert vnbrace Benyngly to pray for me also, As I forsayd, your kyng I was, Et ecce nunc in puluere dormio. 160. The Rich Man's Farewell to the World Pembroke Coll.

The Testament of a Christian Lansdowne MS. 762 Terram terra tegat, demon peccata resumat, Mundus res habeat, spiritus alta petat. Terram terra tegat Ffour poyntis, my will or I hence departe, Reason me moveth to make as I maye: ffirst, to the erthe I bequeth his parteâ My wretched careyn, is but fowle claye. Like than to like, erthe in erthe to laye, Sith it is according, by it I woll abide, As for the first parte of my will, that erthe erth hide. Demon peccata resumat Myne orrible synnes that so sore me bynde, With weight me oppresse, that lyen so many fold, So many in numbre, soo sondry in kynde. The ffeende by his instaunce to theym made me boldâ ffrom hym they come, to hym I yelde wolde. Wherfore, the second parte of my will is thus, That the fende receyue all my synnes as his. Mundus res habeat Whate availeth goodys, am I ones dede and roten? Them all and some I leve, peny and povnde, Truely or vntruely, some I trowe mys-gotenâ Though I wot not of whome, howe, nor in whate grovnde. The worldis they been, them in the worlde I founde; And therfore the thirde parte is of my wille, All my worldly goodis Let the worlde haue still. Spiritus alta petat Nowe for the fourth poynte, and than haue I doo. Nedefull for the soule me thinketh to provide; Hence muste I nedes, but whother shall I goo? I dowte my demeryttys, which weyen on euery side, but goddys mercy shall I truste to be my guyde, Vnder whoes liecens, yet while I maye breth, Vnto heven on high my Soule I bequeth. 163.

HM. 183 As I walkyd vppone a day To take Ã¾e aere off feld and flowre, In a mery morenynge off may When fflowrys were ffull off swete flauowre, I hurd one say, âO god verray, How longe shall I dure yn my dolour!â And one his kneys he began to pray: âNow, good god, send me thy succour, Maryes sone, most off honour, Thatt ryche and poore may po[nyche] and plese. Now geve me lyfe yn my langour, And yeve vs lycence to lyfe yn ese.â To lyfe yn ese and his lawys to kepe, Grawnt me, god, yn blysse so bryght; And withyn Ã¾at cabone lett vs neuer crepe Ther as lucifer lyeth, I-lok withowt eny lyght. My dedly wowndis ere derne and depe, I haue no place to represse Ã¾em aryght, And smertynge wyll nott suffer me to slepe Tyll a leche with dewte haue them dyght. Hitt most be a curate, a crownyd wyght, Ãatt knew the querely off bene &amp; pese; And els thes medicynys haue no myght To geve vs lycense to lyve yn ese. A wykkyd wownde that hath me walt And traveld my body fro top to Ã¾e too, This wykkid wordyll hitt is I-calt Thatt hath many a blayne bothe blak &amp; blo. Hitt hath me hurt and made me halt, My hert, my hondys, my hed also, Nere I had be baptisyd yn watyr and salt Thatt fervent ffester wold nevyr me fro. Thatt lech Ã¾at lyssyd lazer and moo, David and daniel off ther disese, Amend Ã¾es wondis thatt doth me this woo, And geve me lycence to lyve yn ese. This wownd is noryssher off wowndis sevyn: Superbia he is the principallâ Pride pertely yn english stevynâ He is more bitter Ã¾an venyn or gall. To hym I haue had lechis a-levyn And Ã¾ey haue geve medycyns all; Butt Ã¾e soveraynest medicyn vndyr hevyn Hit growith yn grownd noÃ¾er yn wallâ Humilitas I hurd a lech hit callâ Had I hym Ã¾an I were att ese. God, send [hit] me thatt [am] syke thrall, And geve vs lycence to lyve yn ese. Ira is the secund wownd, He ramagith sore both raw and rede; All my cors he doith confownd, So sore he swellith yn hert and hed. I know none herbe thatt growith yn grownd, Nothir no corsiff, will qwinch his quede; Butt louage with-yn a litill stownde will make hym dry and wex all dedde. God, yeve me grace to sow sum lovage sede Ãatt yn my gardyn may rote areyse, &amp; els, as seker as men etyth brede, shall we neuer haue lycence to lyve yn ese. Inuidia the third wownd is, A gritter gnawer Ã¾an ffelone or gowte; A is a wykkid wownd I-wis, Ãer he hath pour to reyse and rowte. The kynde off the wownde for soth is Ã¾is, To brenne the brest withyn and withowt; I askyd a leche how I myght me lys, He toke me charitas I-knytt yn a clowte. He bade me bawme me Ã¾er-with all a-bowte, And than he wold begynne to water and wese; And Ã¾en sone after, withowt any dowte, Thow shalt haue licence to lyve yn ese. Auaricia is an horribill sore, He doth me dere both nyght and day; ffor evyr he covetith more and more Off plastris than I purvay may. I askid a mastir off ffysyke lore, How I myght make hyme dry and vanysh away. Elemosina was a gentyll herbe Ã¾er-for, I-wis one Ã¾e best Ã¾at evyr he say; âTake and a-noynte hym ther-with evyr when Ã¾ou may, And thinke how requiem yn thy rent shall sese, And then sone aftyr with-yn a short day, Thow shalt haue lycence to lyve yn ese.â Accidia is a sowkyng blayne, He bollith and bladderith with-yn my bowre; And makith me ffaynt both flessh and vayne, And kepith me yn cowch like a cowchour. I hurde off an herbe Ã¾att shold lyse Ã¾att payne, Men seith hitt berith a dowbyll flour: Vigilate &amp; orate.

Gula is a grevys gall, He rayvith my rest one my bed; And straynyth my stomake strayte with-all, With many a fest when I am full fed. I walow and weyd as a worme yn a wall I may nott slepe tyll I haue shamely shed. Now mercy, lord, on Ã¾e I call, Thatt for vs lett his brest be bled. A leche hath led his hed to wed Ãatt he wyll make me a playster Ã¾att shall me plese Off abstinencia, &amp; I hym hed Shold geve me license to lyve yn ese. Luxuria is a lither mormale, A mercy! lorde, full of pyte, My brokyll body he bryngith yn bale, And ffrayeth my sowle yn frayalte. Sum tyme a surgeryn told me a tale, This was Ã¾e lesson Ã¾att he lerid me: The rote off an herbe I shold vpp hale, That clerkis callith castitas fre. âPownd hym and temper hym with penitence, When Ã¾e rebaude will on Ã¾e rese, Drayne hym &amp; drynke hym with confessioun, Than shalt thow haue lycense to lyve yn ese.â And othir iij herbis ther beth also Ãat shall save Ã¾is sorys, Ã¾ey shall neuer swell: The ffirst is cordis contricio, Ãat wasshith the wowndis as doith a well; The secund is oris confessio, Ãatt wyll nott suffyr no ded flessh dwell; Operis satisfactio Ãatt soveray[n] sanatyfe sothly to tell.

Vppoun that Resoun I studyed Ã¾at tyde, And ther-to toke I good entent, How kynde wytte setteth sorow be-syde, Wyth eche a mone ther he ys lent; Good suffraunce ys full syldene schent, Whene weyle and woo a-wey schun glyde; Hasty mene often tymes harmes hent, Whene they were bettere to A-byde. I haue harde sungone wyth a harpe, That haste mene sholde wante no woo; They kone notte shylde heme fro showres scharpe, Nayther kene here freende frome here foo.

No wounder is it, though it be leche; To fille another, I note how it shulde. Right so thus this worldis labour wolde Man to gadre goode and grete Riches, But ware of th'ende to hym be no distresse. Who-so that in suche a vessel these tranes shulde, Rest he ne may, day nother nyght, Ete nor drynk whan that they wolde, Therfor in labour thus they do her myght. Right so this worlde wylle that euery maner wight Goode to gete in trowth from oure to oure, That in tyme of nede hem to help and socoure. Goode god! what doth this occupacioune? We trow thus to level the seeâ It may nat be by none ymagynacoune! But the world wil it, as ye may se, That in yowth euery man laboryous to be To gadre Riches, hym to supporte and vpholde In age, whan he wexith fieble and holde. 189. A Song of âGoodsâ Univ.
