And large Cytees/made subgiettis to his honde. Thus firste of Percy/as ye shall vnderstonde. Thoughe he be byrthe/with other londes many. After his fader/was kynge of macedony. The seconde Pystyll that kynge Alysaundre sent to Arystotyles. Whan Alysaundre/as is rehersyd heer. This phylosopher/for ?tues many folde Sent vnto hym/a secret messangeer. Without excuse/to come to his housholde But for he was feble/and olde. And Impotent/on the other syde. And vnwyldy/for to ryde. But chefe cause/why Alysaundre sent. A purpose take/and a fantasye. To declare/playnly what he ment. He wyste in sothe/that in Phylosophy. With other secrettis/of Astronomy. He was experte/and moste coude vnderstonde. This was the chefe/cause of the kynges sonde. Power of planettis/and meuynge of all sterrys. And of eueryche heuenly/intellygence. Disposicion of peas/and eke of werrys. And of eche other straunge/hyd scyence.

Dyfformacions/of Circe and mede. Lokynge of fatis/and pyromancy. On londe and water/crafte of geometry. Heyght and depnesse/with all experyence. Therfore the kynge/desyred his presence. But for all this/within hym selfe a thynge. There was a secret/he kept not to disclose. Nor to publysshe/it openly to the kynge. Takynge example/by two thynges in a rose. Firste howe the floure/grete swetnes doth dispose. Yet in the Thorne/men fynde grete sharpnesse. And thus to cunnynge/it may be a lykenesse. In Erbe and floure/wrytynge worde &amp; stone. Eche hath his vertue/of god and of nature. But the knowynge/is hyde from many one. And nat declared/to eury creature. Wherfore he caste/bytwene reason and measure. To shape awaye/the kynge for to please. And somwhat to vnclose/and set his herte at ease. It is a right/grete dyfference. Bytwene a prynces/coy all dygnyte. And comons rude/of Intellygence. To whom belongeth/nat to medle in no degree. Of comynynges/that shulde be kepte in secretee. But to a kynges/famous magnyfycence. And to Clerkes/whiche haue experyence. It accordeth well/to serche out scrypture. Mysteryes hyd/offowles beestis and tree. And of aungellys/that be moste pure. Of meruaylles/and fysshes in the see. And of stonys/specyally of thre. Don mynerall/a nother regatyfe. Parted or foure/to lengthe a mannes lyfe. Of whiche I radde/amonge other stonys. There was one/called anymall. Foure Elymentis/wrought out for the nonys.
