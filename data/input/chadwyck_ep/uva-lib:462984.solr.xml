      <field name="fulltext">Elizabetha triumphans. [E Elizabeth sole rectrix of this Land] E Elizabeth sole rectrix of this Land, L Long time with thee hath raigned happy Peace: I In all thy deedes assisteth Pallas hand, Z Zenobia-like thy Fame shall neuer cease. A All other Soyles throughout the wondrous world B Behold and see thy sweete prosperitie: E Euen by thy force of late they soone were thrald, T That falsly bragged of their dietie. H Honor, with Peace, Prosperitie, and Fame A Accord with thee, and highly praise thy name. T Triumph (O English people) leap for ioy, R Redouble oft the lawding song ye sing, I In prayse of her who banisheth Anoy. V Vnto Iehouahs alters offerings bring, M Mir, Franckinscence, with euery sweetest flower P Play on your Timbrels, let your Cornets sound. H Heave vp your hands to him that giueth power A And did of late your threatning foes confound. N No Traytors be but honor still her name, S Sithence for her sake Iehouah wrought the same. ELIZABETHA triumphans.. I Write not of the labours (passing strange,) Which Ioves base sonne with wondrous fame atchiu'd: Ne of the actes, the neuer dying actes, That English Kings have done long time agoe. But all my drift is to declare the deedes, The famous deedes that this our sacred Queene Performed hath, sithence Sol hath pass'd the Signes Iust thirtie times, with those his shining lights. Then mightie Ioue, who guides each moving thing, Direct my Muse to that thy flowing streame, Whence flowe amaine both sweete and thundring words, That with those words she may set downe both peace, And warlike déedes this maiden Quéene hath done. The royall state of famous English soile, (Right happy made by this their noble Quéene,) Declares the vertues of a heavenly mind, Adorn'd with all the gifts which Nature can Bestowe, on any of her déerest Nimphes, So deare a darling is Elizabeth, Renowned Queene of this renowned land, Renowned land, because a fruitfull soile: Renowned land through people of the same: And thrise renown'd by this her Uirgin Queene, A maiden Queene, and yet of courage stout, Through Wisedome, rare, for Learning, passing all. Her mother toong is not her only speach, For Spanish, Greeke, Italian, and French, With Romans toong, she understands and speakes, Ne are these all, though more then may be found In female sex, except her stately selfe: For other Vertues are (no lesse of force) Within her royall brest and outward parts. Her comely stature doth not Beautie want, Ne Beautie is from seemely favour barr'd, But both of them do (in the hyest degree, Conioyn'd together) beautefie her port. Among the rest, this must not be forgot, (No lesse praise-worthy then the other are,) Which is. Although she be by Nature weake, Because her sex no otherwise can be: Yet wants she not the courage of her Sire, Whose valour wanne this Island great renowne, So great renowne as neuer Island had. Which high renowne, as yet hath not bin lost, But farre inlarg'd through wonders passing strange, Which have bin done next under God of heauen, By rectrix of these famous Westerne parts.In the yeare 1558. began our gratious Soueraigne to raigne. FOr first of all (which is not least in force) When by the space of sixe whole winter times, The glittering Starres of heauen did nere appeare, Ne Luna bright, for dimme and duskie cloudes Could shew her lights from out the Firmament: When Darkenes ruled Queene of all the earth, Then did a Wolfe (the Pope, a rauenous Wolfe) By stealth breake in among a flock of Sheepe, And there did slay, and having slaine, did glut His greedie paunch, with their most guiltlesse bloud. But when Auror' had sent abroade her lights, And Phebus bright begun to spread his beames, This Wolfe then feared longer there to stay, But theeuishly did haste unto his denne. This ravening Wolfe, this foule deceiptfull Pope, He hates the light because his deedes are nought. The true preaching of the Gospel vpholden by her Maiestie. But England ioy, O England thankefull be, The Night is gone, and now the Day appeares: The God of heaven, who knoweth every thought, And ruleth them by his eternall power: The God of Gods, who is the morning Starre, Which giueth light in every creatures heart, That God (I say) did see his wickednesse, And seeing, would not let it longer last, For by the Sunne, Elizabeth our Queene, Whose vertues shine as bright as Sol it selfe, By that same Sunne the Wolfe is put to flight, And by that Sunne Gods flocke doth liue in rest. From that bright Sunne, Religion hath her beames, Which lightens those who did in darkenesse sit: By that same Sunne, Sinceritie is plast, Where heeretofore false Error ruled Lord, Through that same Sunne Gods word is truly preacht, And by that Sunne all Popish reliques burnt. Paulus Quartus Pope of Rome. WHich happy change did cause the Pope to rage, And put him sore unto his shifting tricks, He studies now how to renue againe His credit crackt through this so foule a foile, He beates his braines, he craves his Counsels aide, And yet in all he strives against the streame, But that his father Sathan (King of Hell) His deerest friend, and wisest counseller, Will have him try, and see to what euent His fond devises will by practise come. Wherefore the Pope, much like a crauin curre, Who quarrell will with euery passenger, But having had a knock for that his fault, He seekes unto his neighbour curres for aide, Them once in fight (though speeding too too bad) H'il leaue alone, and standing thence aloofe, Will ever barke, but never come to bite. So doth the Pope, for chased by our Queene, Whose valiant heart can not abide his brags, From this her land, unto his seate at Rome. 1560 He sitting there, doth barke, and barking sends In all post haste unto the land of Fraunce, (Because he thinks the French-men soonest will Be drawne to thinke that euery tale is true,) With this Ambassage to the young french King. This Popes Ambassage was to the King of Fraunce to this effect. Salute King Frauncis, second of that name, And let him wit, that by the contract made Twixt him and Mary Queene of Scottish land, His rightfull heire vnto the English Crowne. And furthermore, we will he understand, That she who now by force vsurps the same, Can lay no claime vnto that land by right. Which forged tale did please the King so well, Because he was of young and tender yeares, And therewithall the counsell of the Guise, His faithlesse friend, which prickt him forward still, Did so prevaile, as that the french King sent To Scotland diuers forces day by day. Where landed, they do sore torment the Scots, They rule like Kings, who do but aske and have, They waste their countrey, lavish out their goods, Their houses burne, their lives bereave with sword. The Duke of Norfolke sent toward Scotland against the French. The Lord Gray of Wilton fought a battell with the French in Scotland. But when our Quéene (a full of merrie Queene,) Had knowledge of their treason full of baine, She readie made within a little space, A companie of brave and valiant men. The Duke of Norfolke was their generall, Who did remaine at famous Barwick towne: And worthie Gray of Wilton noble Lord, Lieutenant was. He into Scotland went, And with his power did on the French-men set, Where worthy Gray did so their forces quaile, As wearie soone they weare of handie blowes. There did the French (who so triumph'd before) Like scatterd sheepe, for feare runne fast away. There might you see great streames of French-mens blood, And heapes of bodies, which by us were slaine. There men lament for losse of faithfull friends, And women houle, who there were widowes made. The children weepe, to see their mothers sad: And servants grieve because the children crie. These with their teares a running riuer make: These with their sighes do fill the ayre with smoake. These with their noyse do cause an Eccho sound, And make the Earth to quake and shake therewith. Our gracious Quéene, who never thurst for blood, (When thus the French-men once had felt her force) Did use a meane which nearer was to Peace. For why': she sent Sir William Cicill Knight, Her Maiesties chiefe Secretarie then: But now by his desarts and worthie deedes, Lord Treasorer of all this worthie land, Accompanied with wise and learned men, To parle with the French-men which were there. A peace concluded betweene the French-men and vs, by the Lord high Treasorer, the chiefe Secretarie. Whose wisedome did therein so much preuaile, As at that time concluded was a Peace: Whereby the warres of late fire-hote did end, And nought at all redoun'd to Fraunce but shame. This enterprise so peaceably perform'd, In what I pray now doth the Pope triumph? His hope quite frustrate soone agaynst his will Makes him neglect to be at morning Masse. He raues as mad, he curseth Bookes and Beades, All Pater-nosters quite are layd aside: His Images do want their wonted due Of honor now, because so ill he sped. Not any Pardons are dispers'd abroade, Nor merie lookes on any of his Monkes: But dolefully (or rather doultishly) He keepes his Chamber, free from any mirth. Thus lives the Pope still mourning for his losse: Thus mournes the Pope for want of better lucke: Thus want of luck doth make him wish to dye: Thus with his wish his death is come at last. Pius quartus installed Pope. 1561. HE being dead, and for his soule a Masse Next morning sung within his Chappell Church, His Popedomship with Myter, Crowns &amp; Crosse, Are all bestow'd on Pius quintus grace. A man (I wish) not lesse with enuie frought, (Although the daies wherein he liu'd were fewe) Then was the man, which last before him raign'd. For when he was installed in his seate, He straight was troubled with the Popish pippe: He cannot quench his thirst he is so drie: But iudge for what': For English Martyrs blood. He seekes thy bane, O England, thine he seekes: He starues because h'is barred from thy flock, (This English flock, Christs deare and sacred flock) Where are his sheepe within a strong kept hold, Where feede his sheepe of his most heauenly word, Of that same Manna which did fall from heauen. Where sheepheards are, who carefully them keepe, As nere a Wolfe can hurt the poorest sheepe: Though this new Pope doth now reuiue againe The Counsell of Trent reuiued by this Pope this yere. Of Trent the Counsell, to that damned end By Legats sent to diuers forraigne Coasts. Fiue Cardinalls with many Bishops are To go about this worke, by Pius chos'de To this intent, least that the glorious light Which shines most bright among us English-men: Least that same light, Christ with his sacred word Should cleerely shine throughout his placed globe. Whereby the Pope withall his damned deedes, His paynted Gods, his senceles stocks and stones Should be forlorn'd, foreseene of euery one, To let this good, and further that too bad. These Cattel were from Rome dispers'd abroad: But God of heauen, agaynst whose holy will The Pope did call this Counsell wickedly: That God did laugh to scorne his fond deuise, And made it frustrate, and of none effect. His Legats sent, are home agayne return'd (To Rome I meane) but with as bad successe, As had the French-men in their former deede.The Queene of Scots found in England. THe Queen of Scots (who late was Quéen of France) Consenting to the death of Iames the King Of Scotland late, her husband too too true: Was faine to flie for that unnaturall deede From that her natiue and long-holden land. From whence escap'd, she tooke her passage thence To this our land (to happie English land) Where happely she was descri'd by chaunce, But basely clad and with a simple traine: And till the cause of this her landing here Was truely knowne, she closely here was kept. Yet had she all things for a Princesse meete, For where of late she had no trayne at all, But like a simple gentell did remayne: Now hath she men with women at her call, To runne, to ride, to do her any worke; Now hath she sommes, great sommes of English quoyne, To serve her turne at euery needfull time. And yet for all these too too good deedes done To her so bad, quite banish'd from all good. By this Popes meane, she doth perswade the Duke Of Norfolke to rebell agaynst his Queene. The Duke of Norfolke perswaded by this Pope to rebell. He drawne thereto, doth go about to bring Great forraigne powers unto his natiue soyle: He seekes the death of his dread Soueraigne, Whereby he may enioy her royall seate. But (thankes to God) in steade of that he had A Scaffold made, whereon he lost his head. And now for this the Popes so bad successe, He perished as had done all the rest. Pius quintus Pope. ANd for although these Pecocks tayles were puld: Yet doth succeede a bird of that same brood, Who will not let to iet and braue it out. He will not move the King of Fraunce or Spayne With forraigne forces, to inuade this land: But butcher-like he sends abroad his Bulles, To grase within a straungers fertill land. 1569. Doctor Morton sent into the North parts of this Realme with a commission to the like effect. This Pope affirmes: The Queene of English soyle Hath lost the right of this her lawfull seate: And by his power he will absolue from oath Her Subiects, who agaynst her will rebell. This this the Pope, and thus he stirres his stumps: He thirsts for blood, and blood h'de haue to drinke, He will not send unto his neighbour coasts, For to reuiue a Counsell once againe: Rebellion in the North. But traytor-like he will his Pardons give To Rebells, rising in their native soyle. Pastral and Pliar, with D. Storie. This Pope doth send Magitians to her land To seeke her death, by that their deuillish arte: Yea which is more, h'd cause a deuillish doult Of Fraunce, a Doctor (Parry I do meane) Parry alias vp Harry was pardoned by the Queene, condemned for a violent vproare against Hare. With smiling face for to discharge a Dagge At her kind heart, who saued had his life. See here the fruite of kindnes ill bestow'd: See here a wight, worse then the doggest beasts Ungratefull wretch, to Nature farre unlike: For Nature wil's we loue for loue should giue: But thou (alas) by Nature neuer taught, Didst seeke the death of this thy happie Queene. Whose sacred life did save thy dying death, O damned villaine fostred by a Wolfe, Borne of a Tiger, nursed by a Beare. Nay worse then these, did nourish this, foule impe: For Belzabub by blacke Proserpina, Could ne're haue had a deuill halfe so bad. But what ensued thereof: but this of right: The God of heaven, who searcheth every heart, And hath regard unto the innocent, Reueil'd their thoughts, their treasons did display, Before they were by them in practise put, And they who sought to spill her guiltles blood, Did lose their blood, and Parry gain'd a rope. These were the deedes of Pius quintus Pope, Wherein the deuill had no little share: But tooke great paynes, and for his paynes he had The Pope himselfe, with all his Instruments. Gregorie 13. Pope. NOw seeing Paulus nothing could atchieue By Francis meanes: And also seeing that The Northerne power got nought in Pius time: An other Pope (Pope Gregorie forsooth) He needes must shoote as haue the others done, But yet will haue his bowe and arrowes newe. Rebellion in Ireland. His marke is that, whereat the other shot, But takes his aime from Ireland thereto. Fitzmorises, with wretched Desmons Earle, Were chiefest shafts which in his quiuer were. With these same shafts he thought to hit the white, And therefore plac'd them first within his bowe: But ere he could unlose the string thereof And let them flie, whereat they level'd were: The mightie God did cause the warlike Gray To blow a blast, yea such a boysterous blast, As arrowes brake, and bowe in peeces flew, And Pope himselfe constrayn'd to leave his stand. THis Pope though foyl'd, yet will not leaue off so, But since that this his purpose will not fadge, H'd practise now, as haue the other done, By priuate traytors to reuenge his foyle. And like a Foxe who takes his Cubbes abroad Unto a place, where Pullen are at feede: He thether come, will not go in himselfe, But sendeth them, and sayes h'd keepe the watch. Go, spare no blood (saith he) there is ynough, Behead the Geese, destroy both Cocke and Hennes, Leave ne're a Chicke but shalbe motherles, Which done, returne that we may all reioyce, And glut our selues with their desired blood: You for your hire shall have your share therein. The simple Cubbes lesse guilie then the Foxe, Do straight beleeue their Sire is sure a God, And thinke at least they shalbe Kings or Lords: But as they went about their purpose meant, In certaine trappes (which th'owner of that place Had set, to catch the Cattell of that kind) They fast were caught (a straunge and sodaine chaunge) They call for ayde unto their craftie Sire: But he (for sooth) when as he heard the clappe, Did runne away post-hast unto his denne, And leaves his Cubbes to shift to saue their lives. 1580. Edmond Campion and others, Priests. Thus deales the Pope, a subtile dealing Foxe: For when he hath with Popish Pardons sent The Priests (his Cubbes) unto this happie land, Where is the foule whereat he aimeth still. These Iewes-like Cubbes do seeke by all their shifts Francis Throgmorton and the Earl of Northumberland moved to rebellion. Sommerfield moved to kill the Queene. To mooue rebellion here agaynst our Queene. These Catterpillers, persons traytors borne Incourage then to kill her Maiestie. These seeke to bring in straunge and forraigne powers, Which should destroy their natiue Counterie. These publisht tayles and lyes in euery place, And blas'd abroad that this our Soueraigne A tyrant is, (O damned enterprise) When they them-selues forsaken of their Sire, By law condemn'd, have openly confes'd, That nought they sought, nor ought they could looke for, Except the Queene did mercie to them shew. Don John died which preuented the King of Spayne his purpose. 1583. ABout this time did Phillip King of Spayne, By this Popes meanes prepare a mightie power, England therewith he would have ouer-runne: But Don Iohn died who should have meruels done, Whereby he was debarr'd from that his course. The Pope so grieues for this so bad successe, As h'is halfe mad with finding out new meanes, Which once may quench his neuer-ceasing thirst. H'd now leaue of his warlike kind of shifts, And play a while the Grasier in his deedes. He sends abroad his Seminarie Priests To drive his Bulls unto the English soyle. They being there within a fruitfull land, Do fat apace, and too too lustie grow: They cannot live unlesse they have some Kowes, By whom their courage may abated bée. They bull them oft, and bulling get fayre Calues Like to them-selues, within a little space Which grow so fast, as within twise-three yeares They able are to draw the Popish wayne. THe Queene of Scots is chiefest instrument This Pope doth use soone after he doth raigne: For by her meanes there were a companie Of forward gallants brought unto their ends. Fourteene braue youths, with diuers other are By her intised to conspire the death Of their thrise sacred and renowned Queene. Babbington &amp; his companie perswaded by the Queene of Scots to rebellion. Proud Babbington with all his wretched crue, Do seeke the spoyle of this their natiue soyle. These with their friends will ayde such forraigne powers, As shall to dare to land within this Realme. These Catholikes (nay Catterpillers then) Will set this Pope within his former seate In England here, or els thei'l dye the death. These by their oathes have bound themselues thereto: Oh Heauens: O Earth: O neuer-dying Fame: Lament with me for Englands haples lucke: Her haples lucke through these unnaturall sonnes Who seeke to ruine her their mother deare, And lay in wait to slay their carefull Nurse Elizabeth, their Queene and royall Nurse, Whose milke her lawes (her sacred life-full lawes) Was for them food, if that they would have suckt: Whose sacred lawes a cradle (none so sure) Was for their ease, would they have lien therein. And last whose lawes did carefully them warne Least they should fall, by payne which long'd thereto. But these fond youthes (as wayward Children) did Despise the counsell of their carefull Nurse, And for the same they seeke her death (alas) With the confusion of their mother deare. These moued were for sacred Conscience sake To do these deedes (a Deuill sure they were) When they themselues did at their ends confesse, For this their facts promotion they should haue. I that's the Conscience which hath mooued them To seeke an alteration in this land. The Pope he thinks he so deserues the place, As nere he shall it get by iust desarts. The youthfull Sirs so well esteeme of Fame, As if they may attaine unto her Court, Thei'l spare no meanes how to obtaine that place. The Queene of Scots desires to rule this Realme With such whoate zeale, as that she doth not care How many soules unto Elizium Are sent, so she the English Crowne may weare. But marke the end which did ensue thereof. As foolish Flies, which cannot rest at night If that they see a light within their sight, But still will flie unto the flame thereof, Untill they have themselues consum'd therewith: So little power haue they how to resist The burning flames which do ensue there-fro. Or as a Bird, which being set to rest Within a bush, when as he sees the light The which the Fowler carieth in his hand, Doth straight approach unto the flame thereof, Whereby h'is catched in his limed bush. These foolish flies, these fond faceted birds, These witlesse youths, these thursting paragons Can not abide to see so cleere a light, As be the beames which glide from this our Queene, But still they storme, and enuie at the same, And never cease till they consumed are By those the fire-like burning flames thereof. Babbington with his company executed. For Babbington with all his companie Attainted were with these their traiterous actes, And had the hire which is to Traitors due. The Queene of Scots beheaded. The Queene of Scots was guiltie found by lawe, And suffered death for this conspiracie. 1588 THe raging Panther so abhorres to see The maiestie the which a man presents, As at the sight thereof he frets and fumes, And tryes all meanes how to destroy the same. Yea which is more, if happely he spies A painted man, he so enuyes thereat, As nere h'd leave till he defaced hath The fained face which in the picture is. This diuelish Pope a Panther borne by birth, No lesse abhorreth our dread Soueraigne, Her Maiestie doth so offend his sight, As all his thoughts are how it to disgrace. The King of Spayne who as you heard before, Debarred was from comming hitherwards, Hath euer sithence enlarged that his power, Untill this yeare wherein it complet is: In this same yeare of eighty eight, the King Catholique hath (unto the end he may, In England hére the credit of the Pope Renewe againe) had from his holinesse Both money, men, with many of his Bulls. In which he sings the Coockoes song (all one) A clause of the Popes last Bull. Except this clause, He hath both disposs'd Our royall Queene of this her happy seate, And all her Nobles with graue Counsellers Which shall alliant be vnto our Queene. Eke all her Subiects who shall her defend Gainst Spanish King (the King of Catholiques:) And also doth his Holinesse giue power, That this our Queene with all her subiects true, Should euery one be put vnto the sword: And all their Lands with liuings he bestowes On vanquishers, which come to execute His holy will, and diuelish purposes. See these the works of Christs Uicker on earth, Who doth forsake his charge (the cure of soules) And practiseth how to destroy both soules And bodies of Christs deare and sacred flocke Through this his damned doome in that his Bull. Through which his Bull (much like the horned beast Which sent the same:) the King of Spayne naught feares But that he shall receiue his former seate, In England heere, ere end of eighty eight, And therefore hath imbarqued all his men Within a sort of huge and warlike Ships. Seauenscore and tenne of the best fighting ships, Which could provided be within seauen yeares, With all his men which able are to fight, Are ready now to sayle to England-ward. But when the Ruler of this little Isle, (A famous Isle through this her Gouernour,) Did understand of this their whole pretence, She was not slacke in mustring of her men: For lesse then in the space of two whole moneths, She mustered had out of all her Shires, A hundred thousand able fighting men. The Lord high Admirall sent to Sea. The Lord Haward her worthy Admirall, Sir Frauncis Drake Vize-Admirall under him, Lord Thomas Howard and the Sheffild Lord, With diuers other forward Gentlemen: To Sea were sent with all her royall Fleete, To guard the Streights, and méete with that his Fleete. BUt least they should perhaps escape their hands, And land their forces on her aim'd-at land, A Campe on top of Tilbery hill in Essex. A Campe of fiftie thousand able men, Appointed should have layne on Tilbery hill, Where Leicesters thrise made renowned Earle Lieutenant was unto our royall Queene. And Sir Iohn Norris honor'd for his deedes, Lord Marshall was among that companie. The names of the Officers of the field belonging to the Campe. Eake Deuorax of Essex famous Earle, Whose forwardnesse hath made his house renown'd, Was Generall of braue five thousand horse, Which should have come unto that royall Campe. Sir Thomas Laiton chiefest Colloner Of all the footemen which should thether come. Sir Francis Knowles of the great Ordinance, Was Mayster there (a place of great accompt.) And Nicholas Dawterie (Captaine long agoe For former deedes) her Seriant maior was, Sir Roger Williams had the second chardge Of Complet horsse, which armed Launcers bore, And Robert Sidney Knight had equall chardge Of braue light Horsse belonging to that Campe. There Captaine Edward Yorke obtain'd the place Of quarter-Mayster to the placed Campe, And Captaine Crispe, her Prouish-mershall now, Did beare that office in the royall place. The regiments which out of every Shire Elected were, for this most famous Campe, Except those Shires next neighbours to the Sea, Did dayly marche by companyes thereto. Now mightie Mars a stranger heere-tofore, In armour bright with never-yeelding sword, Commes brauely mounted on a foming Steede, Whose trampling causeth such a fearefull noise, As all the world is shaked with his power. Now might you see the field late pasture greene, Wherein the beasts did take their foode and rest, Become a place for braue and worthie men. Heere noble men, who stately houses haue, Do leave them voide, to liue within their Tents. Heere worth' Esquires, who lay on beds of doune, Do Cabben now upen a coutch of strawe: In stead of houses strong, with timber built They Cabbins make of powles, and thinne greene bowes: And where of late their Tables costly were, They now do dine but at an earthie banke: Ne do they greeue at this so hard a chainge, But thinke them-selves thereby thrise happy made: For when there were a twentie thousand come Of braue footemen unto this placed Campe, And twise-tenne hundred well appointed Horsse, To serue with Launce, and Demilances there, They all on heapes do make so brave a showe, As it was thought that then there were ynowe, For to encounter with their look'd-for foes: Wherefore there went commaundement from the Lords, Who of her honorable Counsell are, That those which were as yet not thether come, Should stay from thence within their seuerall Shires, Untill there came some newes of farther neede. They thereby stai'd, do greatly greeue thereat, And often say for that their hap is bad. A regiment of a thousand footemen of Dorset shire offered fiue hundred pounds that they might go forward to the Campe. An Essex-man a souldier, able to keepe in pay three moneths 500. men Yea which is more, there was a regiment But of one thousand men of Dorset-shire Which offered fiue hundred pounds that they Might forward goe unto the royall Campe. And further marke. (I tell a right strange tale, I hard of one who was of great regard In Tilb'ry Campe,) There serued with the rest An Essex-man, who was a Muskater, Who being met by one which neere him dwelt, Was asked why he serued with a gunne, The souldier sayd, my friend you are deceiu'd, This is no gunne, a Musket we it call, The other said, but sir you have enow Of seruants who are very able men, And might haue had performed this your charge In better sort then can your weakely selfe, It is right true (replied the souldier then,) I haue some store of servants at my house, And (thanks to God) I able am and will (If that our Queene shall stand in any neede,) Prouide five hundred well appointed men, To serue where-as her Highnesse shall thinke good: And they euen there at mine owne cost shall serue Iust three whole months, and yet will I my selfe There like-wise be (as now a Muskater.) The fame of this her Subiects forwardnesse, Did please so well our sacred Soveraigne, As she desires to see her placed Campe, There-fore there was by her a downe-set day, Where-in she would fullfill her purpose meant. The Queene came to the Campe. Now came the day, the happy blisse-full day, Where-in Aurora putting foorth hir head, Hir curled head with wirey hanging locks Of brightest Siluer, whence did newlie shine Hir clearest streames, and neuer-darkened lights. The morning gray, wher-in the houering Larks, (Whose sweete shrill notes recording hermonie Resound with-in the heauenly creatures eares,) Did notise giue to wretched Phaetons Sire, To harnesse up his fierce and furious Steeds, To drawe him thence unto his Westerne home. From whose cleare beames once in his Chariot plast, Did gladsome glimps as bright as burnisht Gold, Shine all displai'd upon the Waightie Globe. On this same day, a faire and glorious day, Came this out Queene, (a Queene most like her selfe) Unto her Campe, (now made a royall Campe,) With all her troupe, (her Court-like stately troupe,) Not like to those who coutch on stately Doune, But like to Mars, the God of fearefull warre, And heauing oft to Skies her war-like hands, Did make her selfe Bellona-like renown'd. The Lord Lieutenant notice had there-of, Who did forth-with prepare to entertaine The sacred Goddesse of this English soyle, The order how, thus presently ensues. The order of the Queenes entertainement into the Campe. On euery side of that directest way From Block-house where she should be set on land Unto the outward quarter of the Campe, There rancked were both armed men and shot, With Captaines, who of them had taken charge, To entertaine their sacred Generall. The other Captaines with their companies, Still resident were at their Corps du guard, Where-as they ranked all their arm'd-men first: Behinde them were the shot in seuerall ranks, With equall distance twixt the placed rowes, Which made a passing brave and war-like showe. The Earle of Leicester with those Officers Which chosen were to gouerne in the field, At water-side within the Block-house stayd In readinesse there to receiue our Queene. Who landed now, doth passe along her way, She thence some-way still marching kinglike-on, The Canons at the Block-house were discharg'd: The Drums do sound, the Phiphes do yeeld their notes, And Ensignes are displayd through-out the Campe. Our peerelesse Queene doth by her Souldiers passe, And shewes her selfe unto her Subiects there: She thanks them oft for their (of dutie) paines, And they againe on knees do pray for her. They coutch their Pikes, and bowe their Ensignes downe When as their sacred royall Queene past by, In token of their loyall beared hearts To her alone, and none but only she. A troupe of braue and warre-like Horssemen did (Conducted by Sir Roger Williams Knight,) Meete with the Queene amid the way she came, The halfe whereof, which was fiue hundred Horsse, A thousand Horsse march behinde and before her Maiestie. Most stately Steedes, made complete for the field, With neighing sounds, and fomed champing bitts, Betrampling sore the ground whereas they stoode Attended on her sacred selfe. The rest Five hundred more (in nought to them unlike) Before her traine in stately order marcht, These ioyntly did with twentie hundred men Which footemen were, our gratious Soveraigne guard, Two thousand footmen garded her person to her lodging. Unto the house whereas she lay all night. Whether once come, the horse-men turned backe, But all the rest with her great Seriant did Watch there all night aloofe her royall Court. The souldyers which placed were farre off From that same way through which she past along, Did hollow oft, the Lord preserue our Queene. He happy was that could but see hir Coatch, The sides where of beset with Emmerods, And Diomonds with sparkling Rubies red In Checker-wise by strange inuention, With curious knots embrodered with golde Cast such a glimse as if the heavenly place Of Phebus were by those his foming Steedes On foure round wheeles drawne all along that way Thrise happy they who sawe her stately selfe, Who Iuno-like drawne with her proudest birds, Whose tayles do hold her Heard-mans hundred eyes, Passed along through quarters of the Campe Thus all along her Highnesse like her selfe Hath passed by her subiects (ioyfull made Through this her louing and renowned deede) From out the Campe unto her lodging then, Full three miles distant from that warlike place Prepared for her to Maister Ritche his house, With purpose meant for to returne next day That way againe, the better it to view. Now when Bright-day was to her pallace gon. And by that time had locked up her lights Within their place strong walled with cleere glasse, To take their rest untill the morning tide: By this same time our sacred Generall Was come unto her new prepared Court. There entred once and in their lodgings plast, The Courtiers talke is of the warlike show They sawe that day within the royall Campe. Some praise the place whereas they camped are: Some praise the discipline is vs'd therein: And othersome the passing forwardnesse Of Noble men, and Gentels lying there: But all of them do say, the Souldiers are Most comely men appoynted well thereto. Thus with this talke, Time hasted fast away, And wish'd-for Rest did come among them then, Who bids them all unto his loved house; They willingly do yeeld to her request, And euery one is come unto her place: The doore whereof was called Wearines, And Drowsines bore name of her first roume: The other were term'd Slumbers (passing sweete) Slumbers. A Sound-sleepe was the name of that her house Her seruants who did entertaine her guestes Were these, A mind free from all worldly care, An earnest will, with A conuenient place, The guests thus come at this their welcome ioy, And there do finde all things they could desire. But Enuie, who doth ioy in nought but warres, Doth helpe to end this their so pleasant mirth: For fearefull Dreames, with foolish phantasies, The formost foes that quiet Rest torments, Come first to make an hurly-burly there. Then brightest Day the others Generall, Doth banish Rest quite from her late-held house, And leaves her guests unto their day-ment deedes. NOw by the time that Phæbus had beyok'd His foming Steedes within their harnesses To draw his bright and neuer-darkned lights: The Captaines of the Campe with all their men Did from their quarters with their seuerall charge Come marching to the place prepar'd for Armes, When thether come was every officer, A royall battell royally was set With two most strong and braue Battallians. A Battell set with two Battallians against her Maiestie came agayne to the Campe. The Vangard whereof by the Lord Marshall: The Reerward by Sir William Knowles was set: And last the Seriant Maior Generall The Battell set in like most war-like sort. Twixt every fight their seuerall troopes of horse, And two braue troopes did guard the outward Flankes The Battells set do march in braue aray Both too and fro the stately Generall, Who now was come unto the place of Armes With all her noble and renowned trayned Where glittering harnesse giues such gleaming lights, And from those lights reflecteth such a heate, As Heauen and Earth with Planets greatly feare, Least Phaeton agayne to Heauen was come, And had obtain'd to guide his fathers lights. The trampling horses with their mist-like breath, Do fill the Ayre with such a sodaine smoake, As Iupiter did feare least Terra was New set on fire by that fore-named heate. The Drommes, the Phiphes, the Trumpets passing shrill, Do sounded yeeld such marching forward notes, As Mars himselfe with all his train'd-up men, In Armes are prest, as if the Goddesse Peace Were comming now to banish him the field. Which war-like showe with that Mars thundring noyse, So ravished our princely Soveraigne, (Addicted only then to Marshall prowes) As that she doth (her trayne forbid therefro) Most bravely mounted on a stately Steede The Queene leaveth her traine to go to see her battels. With Trunchion in her hand (not vs'd thereto) And with her none, except her Liutenant, Accompaned with the Lord Chamberlaine, Come marching towards this her marching fight. In nought unlike the Amazonian Queene, Who beating downe amaine the bloodie Greekes, Thereby to grapple with Achillis stout, Even at the time when Troy was sore besieg'd. He had that wight (that thrise puissant wight) Who well perform'd twelue labors passing straunge, A brauer grace encountring with his foes, Then this our Queene in that her marching pace. Thus comes our Queene (our thrise renowned Queene) A Generall beseeming such a Campe: Thus comes our guide, a princely carefull guide, In war-like sorte to see her warring men, Who couched had their strong defensiue Pikes, As if they were to fight at push thereof. She nigh them come, they pitch their fore-couch'd Pikes, And she stands still to see the Battell set, With ioy to see her men to keepe their rankes, Now Voada once Englands happie Queene, Through Romans flight by her constrain'd to flie: Who making way amidst the slaughtered corps, Pursued her foes with honor of the day With Vodice her daughter (her too like, Who urging wounds with constant courage died) Are now reuiu'd, their vertues liue (I say) Through this our Queene, now Englands happie Queene. For they no more did in those actuall deedes, Thrise famous deedes through Cactes fatall fall, With losse which there the valiant Planch'us lost Their Prowes shew, then did our sacred Queene Here signes display of courage wonderfull. For when our Queene (an Amazonian Queene) Most carefully the Vauward had beheld, She thence doth go the Reerward for to see, And takes a view of two strong set Flankes: Homage done to her Highnes by the Souldiers. At whose by passing, Launce with Pike are bow'd, And all yeeld reuerence to her sacred selfe. Her officers with all her Souldiers there, Do tokens shew of their made-ioyfull hearts. She giues them thankes as had she done before: Who nought have done but what their dueties bid. Her statelines was so with loue-show'd ioyn'd, As all there then did ioyntly ioy and feare. They ioy'd in that they see their rulers loue: But fear'd least that in ought they should offend Agaynst her selfe, the Goddesse of this land, Thus causing ioy and feare, she passed thence With cherefull heart for this her late viewed sight Unto the Tent of her Liuetenant there: Were readie were in readines each thing, Which could be fit to entertayne a Queene. The Battell broke vp. The Battell set, is soone agayne broke up: Where foming Steedes, right fearce and raging Steedes Now marching raise the loose and scatterd dust: As Sols bright beames, ne Ayre much Azure-like. Within a space could be discern'd so thicke This raysed dust obfuscated the light. The companies asunder parted once, Do now returne to whence they first were brought, Where nought is heard among the Souldiers, But how, the Queene did lately shew her selfe The only Empresse that on earth hath liu'd. The Queene went out of the Campe. When Phæbus lights were in the middle part Twixt East and West fast hasting to his home: Our Soueraigne (our sacred blisfull Queene) Was readie to depart from out her Campe. Agaynst whose comming, every Captaine was There prest to shew themselves in readines, To do the will of their high Generall. There might you see most brave and gallant men, Who lately were beclad in Mars his cloathes, Inranked then in Court-like costly suites. Through whom did passe our Queene most Dido-like. (Whose stately heart doth so abound with love, As thousand thanks it yeelds unto them all) To water-side to take her royall Barge. Amidst the way (which was the outward Ward Of that her Campe) her Seriant Maior stood Among those Squadrans which there then did ward. Her eyes were set so earnestly to view, As him unseene she would not passe along, The Queene called her Seriant Maior vnto her, and deliuered a message. But calls him to her rich-built Couches sides, And thanking him (as oft before she had) Did will him do this message from her mouth, Deliuered with full of wisedome words. Which that it may not altogether be (Through unfit words hew'd from a stonie wit) Obliterated to my utter shame: Ye sacred Dames, ye seauen-fold Nimphes (I meane) (Whose thickie groues resound your heauenly words: Whence every Arte had first their seuerall names) Be-bathe my temples with those peerl-like droppes Which fall amaine from that your siluer streame: That through your ayde my wit now dulled sore, May quickned be with that your flowing Arte. Then shall I write in these my lines too rude Her royall speech(though nothing like her speech) Which in effect was it that here ensues. The effect of the Queenes speach. We will them know that now by proofe we see Their loyall hearts to vs their lawfull Queene. For sure we are that none beneath the Heauens Have readier Subiects to defend their right: Which happines we coumpt to vs as cheefe. And though of love their dueties craue no lesse, Yet say to them that we in like regarde, And estimate of this their dearest zeale, (If time of neede shall euer call them foorth To dare in field their fearce and cruell foes) Wilbe our selfe their noted Generall. Ne deare at all to vs shalbe our life, Ne Pallaces or Castles huge of stone Shall hold as then our presence from their view: But in the midst and very heart of them, Bellona-like we meane as then to march; On common lot of gayne or losse to both, They well shall see we recke shall then betide. And as for honor with most large rewards, Let them not care they common there shalbe: The meanest man who shall deserue a might, A mountaine shall for his desart receive. And this our speach, and this our solemne vowe, In feruent loue to those our Subiects deare, Say Seriant Maior, tell them from our selfe, On Kingly faith we will performe it there. Which sayd, she bow'd her princely bodie downe, And passed thence vnto the water-side: Where once imbarg'd the roring Cannons were Discharg'd, both those which were on Tilb'rie hill, And also those which at the Block-house were: And there euen then the fore-white mant'led Ayre, From whence the Sunne shed foorth his brightest beames, Did cloathe it selfe with darke and duskie hue, And with thick Clowdes bar'd Phæbus gladsome streames From lightning then the Earth with glorious shew. It powres foorth showers in great and often droppes, Signes of the griefe for her departure thence. And Terra now her Highnesse foot-stoole late, Refuseth quite those drops desir'd before, To moysten her dri'd vp and parched parts, And of her selfe even then she yeelded foorth Great store of waters from her late-dri'd heart, Now deeply droun'd for this the parted losse Of that her sacred and renowned Queene. But happie Thames (thrise happie at this time) Turnes backe with speede his lately ebbing course: He calmes his billowes raging sore before, And makes it flow with a swift running streame. And Æolus to him a friendly King, Recals his boysterous Boreas to his den, Sent late abroad with such sore thundring blasts As be the cracks which come, when angrie Ioue Throwes from his seate his hurtfull Thunder-boults, Him he tyes up within an hollow caue, With three link'd chaines with huge and strong-made locks Least that he should annoy her sacred selfe, Who now was caried on the riuer Thames. Diuers troupes of horsse shewed by her Noble men at S. Iames her Pallace. These ioyntly thus conuay our royall Queene Unto her Pallace by S. Iames his fields; Where resident her forward Noble men Do orderly their forwardnes her shew. There by her gates do every day passe by Diuers brave troopes of well appoynted horse: They thether come, triumphant triumphs make, And bravely runne at Tilt and Turny then, To shew their prowes to our Goddesse there. Thus they at home, thus they in Campe who lie With those who coast upon the narrow Seas. Do daylie looke, when those our look'd for foes Will dare to tread, or looke vpon her land. The Fleete of Spayne first descried by Captaine Flemming. Who now perchaunce by Captaine Flemmings happe Descried were, fast sayling hether-ward With such a Fleete, as neuer bore the Seas So hugh a Fleete (except this Spanish-fleete.) Now worthie Haward lodg'd in Plimmouth sound, Most of the Fleete within the Hauen then, (By his great care with much inquirie made,) Receiving notise by the fore-nam'd man, Brought out the Fleete the same next following night Into the sound by his incessant toyle. Although the winde (the hurtfull Sotherne-winde) Did blow amaine into the Havens mouth: A wondrous thing, and worthie right to note. Which done (Aurora putting foorth his head With wirie lockes, the glimpsing light whereof Did chase blacke Night unto his darksome cave) The Generall with all his war-like power Did hoyst up sayles (yea all their helping sayles) To meete with that the Spanish late-seene Fleete. Thus arrow-like they scouring on the Seas, Are within sight of that long look'd-for Fleete. Now do they see the Spanyards shippes on heapes, In al things like a huge and pop'ler towne: Their bigge-made Barkes with huge and mightie Mastes, Like Churches are with steeples very high: Their lesser Shippes like stately Pallaces Which Princes build to keepe their brave-kept traine: Their Gallies small, like smaller houses stand, Inhabited by those which meaner are: In briefe, they all in nothing are unlike Unto the Troians stately new-built towne, Which nought did feare the Greekes bewrong'd by them. Thus ride these shippes, the Spanish' strong-made shippes, Which nothing daunt our never-yeelding men, But makes their hearts (before halfe dead for feare, Least they would not fullfill the rumor nois'd) To leape within their bodies new reviv'd By this the sight of that discerned Fleete. The pinesse Disdaine went to call for the Queene of England. Thence swift Disdayne, (disdaining Englands foes) With worthy Ionas Captaine of her men, By his three times made famous Generall, To cry to them for Englands royall Queene. Was sent forth-with unto the Spanish Fleete. Where strong Disdayne performed so her part In that her charge late given to her care, As all her foes her now attein'd-to foes, Were halfe strooke dead at that her Captaines tale. Although for shame they made no show thereof, But in a bravery by the brave Disdayne, Do offer fight unto our readie Fleete. And marvell not why they so forward were, For Æolus (a full of pitie King) Perceiving well their dismall comming doome, Kept in his Winds within their dwelling cave, The dore thereof fast locked by him-selfe: And quiet Calme was over all the Seas To helpe their strength abated very much, Whereby the Spanyards Gallyes safely might Rowe too and fro t'indanger us by fight, The greatest helps they possibly might have Next God of heaven, who rules and guides both these: And yet although their strength is quite as great As is the Fleete which must withstand their blowes, For that their Ships with chaines together linckt Did seeme much like a faire and strong-built Towne, But (as they sayd) ours were but Fisher-boats: And lastly though King AEolus him-selfe With Neptunes Calme did are their monstrous Fleete, Yet (thanks to thee, ô ever-living God, The God of Gods, a carefull helping God To those thy Saincts, thy wellbeloved flocke, Who put their trust in none, but only thee:) Thy servant Haward through thy mightie power (The Generall thereof, but too-too bold In forwardnesse to finish dangerous actes,) With those his Ships (with them but Fisher-boates) Certaine of the Spanyards Ships sunke. Be battered the thicke bombasted sides Of their most strong and tall at fighting Ships, As most of them did carry messengers Unto King Neptune ruler of the Seas. The smaller part which made the greater haste, Did Triton meete, his thundring Trumpetter, Who bids them welcome towards his Kings Court, And asketh them where all their fellowes are. They like so well of this his Court-like speach, As ravished they are with these his words, Which make them turne to fetch their companie, Who some-what slowe in that their warrant meant, Were forward sent by Lord high Admirall And Noble men, made Noble through their déedes. There might you see the Arke by Rawley built, With her de ender, Generall of the Fleete, Put in amaine amongst his thickest foes, And there and then performed worthily Such enterprises as he tooke in hand. And after him for his more safe a-gard, Came noble Howard then a forward Lord, In charging there his late triumphing foes: Lord Sheffild eke though but of tender yeares, Gave place to none for forwardnesse to fight, Nor worthie Drake, (no stranger to the Ships Which Spayne doth owe) was quailed with their sight. Ne Suthwell sterne, with valiant Frobisher, Did there stand still to looke upon the fight. But ioyntly these, with all them present there, Do prease so sore their now sore weakened foes (Through five houres fight) as fayne they are to rest The battered sides of their bombasted Ships For space of one whole houre, and some-what more. That time expir'd they fight afresh againe, The fight renewed before the Ile of Wight. And ioyntly meete before the Isle of Wight, Where then began a fierce and greater fight. There Musket-shot discharg'd of either Fleete, Did fall like haile into the raging Seas. There Crosse-barres flew most liberally bestowed, Which brake the sides of their late battered Ships: And there was cast against each others foe, A thousand balles of wild-fire mercilesse, By which were sent great store of Spanish Ships, To follow those that were to Neptune gone. And least the first should troubled be too sore, In comming backe to fetch this late-sent traine, These meete with them halfe-way (their look'd-for friends) Whence all make hast unto King Neptunes Court, Where they do finde such pleasant pleasing friends, As neare they'l to King Phillips Pallace turne. A world it is to see what messengers They send to shew in what estate they stand, For Spanish-felts with Spanyards dearest bloud Becheckereth the Sea with black and red, As there no white could possibly be seene. Don Pedro taken prisoner. Don Pedro with his Ship and company Did like so ill (the cause I know not why) Of that the newes these messengers did bring, As they do better Englands bondage like, Then Neptunes Court from whence these lately came. The other Ships in better case then his, Do neither like their state; ne yet his choise, But thinke it best to trust unto their heeles. Wherefore they hoise up all their Sayles at once, And take their way to Callice Haven, whereas They lye at Rode, with often wishes that They were againe in Spayne from whence they came. Ours not farre off, do rest their toyled corps Sore overchargd by too-too forwardnes In prosequting their late quailed foes. Where for their déedes, their well-perfourmed déedes, Certaine of our Fleete Knighted. Lord Thomas Haward, with the Sheffild Lord, And Roger Towns-end forward in those warres, With Martin Frobisher (not a little knowne,) Most worthie Gentells newly entertain'd, By mighty Mauors, from Bellona Ouéene, Receiv'd from her the gift of Knighthood there. Which deede performed, England was not slacke In trying meanes which might anoy her foes. For presently a wondrous Stratageme Did then ensue, by her in practise put. English Ships set on fire by the Lord Charles Hawards commaundment. For certaine Ships of our worst English Ships, By Lord, Charles Haward worthy Generall Commanded, were forth-with then set on fire: Which driven thence through a swift running streame Did fall among the Spanyards roding-Ships. At which strange sight they so astonied were, As they reioic'd that could the Cables cut, Which fastned were unto their Anchors cast. This sudden maze which nothing setled wits, Were chiefest cause of this their second baine: For then each Ship on others cables foule: And runne on rocks to their ensuing losse: They hoist up Sailes, and as they thether came So hye they fast unto the Northerne Seas: These thus in flight are chased very sore By Generall of this our conquering Fleete: Who Lion-like (sufficed nere ynough With Honors lawd) pursues his flying foes. And Comberland a wondrous forward Earle But new imbarkt, attayning to this flight Did shew himselfe, and shewing made them feele His power, not felt before of Spanyards. What shall I say, or what could that her Fleete Performe in better sorte then there was done. Their Spanish foes with all that conquered Fleete (Although they sayd that English-land was theirs: And therefore when they first received word That then but thirtie little English Boates Could be descri'd, cried oft Victoria) Are sunke, are drown'd, are burnt with Englands fire, And grounded lye before the French-townes Haven. The rest (even then remayning weakly) sayle They know not whether, guided by their Fate, Now chased farre beyond this Islands bounds. Our little Fleete, our famous Generall Doth shame to follow them that will not fight, And therefore turnes his course unto his charge, Still sayling with an happie Sotherne-winde Attaines unto the same the Narrow Seas: Where setting every thing in needfull sort, The Lord high Admirall goeth to the Court. Left then the Fleete and hasted to the Court Of his thrise sacred Soveraigne our Queene: Whose welcome thether was as his desarts And famous deedes performed, had deserv'd. Our gracious Queene (for this Gods mercie shew'd To her, her land, through conquest over them, Who came to seeke her death, and death of those Who stedfast are unto his holie word) Doth yeeld him thankes devoutly on her knees, And wills her Subiects throughout all her land To fast and pray for this his providence. Sixtus Quintus now Pope of Rome. But Sixtus quintus Pope of whorish Rome, Hath lost his Bulls, and hath his Souldiers lost With credit crackt, and all in eighty eight. And well I wit, what was the cause thereof, Belike his Saints, him-selfe, and Cardinals, With Friers, Monks, and Seminarie Priests, Were all at Dice for Englands peoples goodes, And quite forgot to fall to morning Masse. Or otherwise, they told their Beades so oft, And said so many Mattins to their gods, (Their wodden gods,) as that they fell asléepe, And so left off to persevere in prayers; Whereby their Saints at that time sleepie too, Did like-wise nod, and sued not to their gods. Or lastly thus (which likest is of all,) His Silver scant, where-by his Crosses few, And holy-water niggardly bestowed, Did scarsly blesse his Souldyers going forth: For which hard dearth the God of heaven (our God) Did wash them all with-in his hallowed Seas, Where plentie is of water like the Popes. By which, (as by his goodnesse ever shewed To England, where his little flocke remaines, With alwayes losse unto the haplesse Pope) His holynesse, with all deceiv'd by him, Or instruments he to that end hath sent, May now confesse with sore repenting heart, That long ynough they all provoked have Our loving God, to never ceasing ire. But if his Father Belzebub that féend Hath bound the Pope so to his damned lore, As that he cannot turne unto the Lord: Yet English-men Recusants, (ah I greeve To tearme ye so because my Countrey-men,) Despise his déedes, (his méere deceiptfull deedes,) And turne your hearts unto your sacred Queene: And with your Queene beloved of our God, Turne to Gods word, and shunne the divelish Pope. So God will ioy in this his little flocke, And blesse this Land with still increasing store, Where-as he now like to a naturall Sire Weeps over it, as once he shedded teares, When that he sawe Ierusalem he lov'd. Which (heavenly God) with three-fold Nestors yeares Given to our Queene, to Englands ever ioy, Fullfill (I pray) with such convenient speede, As shall seeme good unto thy holy will. FINIS</field>
