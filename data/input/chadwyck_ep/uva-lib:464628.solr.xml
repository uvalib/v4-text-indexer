      <field name="fulltext">ANACREON. The Lute. I. Of th'Atrides I would sing, Or the wandring Theban King; But when I my Lute did prove, Nothing it would sound but Love; I new strung it, and to play Herc'les labours did essay; But my pains I fruitlesse found, Nothing it but Love would sound; Heroes then farewell, my Lute To all strains, but Love, is mute. Beauty. II. Hornes to Buls wise Nature lends: Horses she with hoofs defends: Hares with nimble feet relieves: Dreadful teeth to Lions gives: Fishes learns through streams to slide: Birds through yeelding air to glide: Men with courage she supplies: But to Women these denies. What then gives she? Beauty, this Both their arms and armour is: She, that can this weapon use, Fire and sword with ease subdues. Loves Night walk. III. Downward was the wheeling Bear Driven by the Waggoner: Men by powerful sleep opprest, Gave their busie troubles rest: Love, in this still depth of night, Lately at my house did light: Where perceiving all fast lockt, At the door he boldly knockt: Who'se that (said I) that does keep Such a noise, and breaks my sleep? Ope saith Love, for pity hear; Tis a Childe, thou need'st not fear, Wet and weary, from his way Led by this dark night astray: With compassion this I heard; Light I struck; the door unbarr'd: Where a little Boy appears, Who wings, bow, and quiver bears; Near the fire I made him stand; With my own I chaf't his hand; And with kindly busie care Wrung the chill drops from his hair: When well warm'd he was, and dry, Now saith he tis time to try If my bow no hurt did get, For me thinks the string is wet: With that, drawing it, a dart He let fly that pierc'd my heart: Leaping then, and laughing said, Come my friend with me be glad; For my Bow thou seest is sound, Since thy heart hath got a wound. IV. [On this verdant Lotus laid] On this verdant Lotus laid, Underneath the Myrtles shade, Let us drink our sorrows dead, Whilst Love plaies the Ganimed. Life like to a wheel runs round; And ere long, we underground (Tane by Death asunder) must Moulder in forgotten dust. Why then graves should we bedew? Why the ground with odours strew? Better whil'st alive, prepare Flowers and unguents for our hair: Come my fair One, come away; All our cares behinde us lay; That these pleasures we may know, Ere we come to those below. Roses. V. Roses (Loves delight) let's joyn To the red-cheek'd God of wine: Roses crown us, while we laugh, And the juyce of Autumn quaff: Roses of all flowers the King: Roses the fresh pride o'th' Spring: Joy of every Deitie; Love, when with the Graces he For the Ball himself disposes, Crowns his golden hair with Roses. Circling then with these our brow Wee'l to Bacchus Temple go: There some willing Beauty lead, And a youthful measure tread. Another. VI. Now with Roses we are crown'd Let our mirth and cups go round: Whilst a Lasse, whose hand a spear Branch'd with Ivy twines doth bear, With her white feet beats the ground, To the Lutes harmonious sound, Playd on by some Boy whose choice Skill is heightned by his voice: Bright-haird Love, with his divine Mother, and the God of wine Will flock hither, glad to see Old men of their companie. The Chace. VII. With a whip of Lillies, Love Swiftly me before him drove: On we courst it, through deep floods, Hollow valleys, and rough woods, Till a Snake that lurking lay Chanc'd to sting me by the way: Now my soul was nigh to death, Ebbing, flowing with my breath; When Love, fanning with his wings, Back my fleeting spirit brings; Learn (saith he) another day Love without constraint t'obey. The Dream. VIII. As on Purple Carpets I Charm'd by wine in slumber ly, With a troop of Maids (resorted There to play) me thought I sported: Whose companions, lovely Boies, Interrupt me with rude noise: Yet I offer made to kisse them, But o'th' sudden wake and misse them: Vext to see them thus forsake me, I to sleep again betake me. The Dove. IX. Whither flies my pretty Dove? Whither nimble Scout of Love? From whose wings perfumes distill, And the air with sweetness fill. Is't to thee which way I'me bent? By Anacreon I am sent To Rodantha, she who all Hearts commands; Loves Generall. I to Venus did belong, But she sold me for a song To her Poet, his I am, And from him this Letter came, For which he hath promis'd me That ere long hee'l set me free: But though freedom I should gain, I with him would still remain; For what profit were the change, Fields from tree to tree to range, And on Hips and Haws to feed, When I may at home pick bread From his hand, and freely sup Purest wine from his own cup? Hovering then with wings displaid I my Master overshade: And if night invite to rest, In his Harp I make my Nest. Now thou do'st my errand know, Friend, without more questions go: For thy curiosity Makes me to outchat a Py. Love in Wax. X. As Loves image, to be sold, Wrought in wax I did behold, To the man I went; what is Friend said I the price of this? Give me what you please (he said) This belongs not to my trade, And so dangerous a guest In my house I'me loth should rest. Give m'him for this piece, said I, And the Boy with me shall ly: But Love see thou now melt me, Or Ile do as much for thee. The old Lover. XI. By the women I am told 'Lasse Anacreon thou grow'st old, Take thy glasse and look else, there Thou wilt see thy temples bare; Whether I be bald or no That I know not, this I know, Pleasures, as lesse time to try Old men have, they more should ply. The Swallow. XII. Chattering Swallow, what shall we, Shall we do to punish thee? Shall we clip thy wings, or cut Tereus like thy shrill tongue out? Who Rodantha driv'st away From my dreams, by break of day. XIII. [Atis though deserted groves] Atis though deserted groves Cybele invoking roves: And like madness them befell Who were drunk at Phæbus Well: But I willingly will prove Both these Furies, Wine, and love. The Combat. XIV. Now will I a lover be, Love himself commanded me. Full at first of stubborn pride, To submit, my soul denide: He his Quiver takes and Bow, Bids defiance, forth I go, Arm'd with spear and shield; we met: On he charges, I retreat: Till perceiving in the fight He had wasted every flight, Into me, with fury hot, Like a dart himself he shot, And my cold heart melts: my shield Uselesse, no defence could yield; For what boots an outward skreen When (alas) the fights within? XV. [I not care for Gyges sway] I not care for Gyges sway, Or the Lydian scepter weigh; Nor am covetous of gold, Nor with envy Kings behold: All my care is to prepare Fragrant unguents for my hair: All my care is where to get Roses for a Coronet; All my care is for to day; What's to morrow who can say? Come then, let us drink and dice And to Bacchus sacrifice, Ere death come and take us off, Crying, hold! th'hast drunk enough. The Captive. XVI. Thou of Thebes, of Troy sings He, I my own captivitie; 'Twas no Army, horse or foot, Nor a Navy brought me too't, But a stranger Enemy Shot me from my Mistresse eye. The Cup. XVII. Vulcan come, thy hammer take, And of burnisht silver make (Not a glittering armour, for What have we to do with war? But) a large deep Bowle, and on it I would have thee carve, (no Planet Pleiads Waines nor Waggoners, What have we to do with stars? But to life exactly shape) Clusters of the juicy grape; Whilst brisk Love, their bleeding heads Hand in hand with Bacchus treads. Another. XVIII. All thy skill if thou collect, Make a Cup as I direct: Roses climbing ore the brim, Yet must seem in Wine to swim; Faces too there should be there, None that frowns or wrinkles weare, But the sprightly Son of Jove, With the beauteous Queen of Love; There, beneath a pleasant shade By a Vines wide branches made, Must the Loves, their armes laid by, Keep the Graces company: And the bright-haird God of day With a youthful Beavy play. XIX. [Fruitful Earth drinks up the rain] Fruitful Earth drinks up the rain, Trees from Earth drink that again, The Sea drinks the Air, the Sun Drinks the Sea, and him the Moon: Is it reason then d'ee think I should thirst when all else drink. The Wish. XX. Niobe on Phrygian sands Turn'd a weeping Statue stands: And the Pandionian Maid In a Swallows wings arraid; But a Mirrour I would be, To be lookt on still by Thee; Or the Gown wherein thou'rt drest, That I might thy Limbs invest; Or a Chrystal Spring, wherein Thou might'st bath thy purer skin; Or sweet Unguents, to anoint And make supple every Joynt; Or a Knot, thy Breast to deck; Or a Chain, to clasp thy Neck; Or thy Shoe I wish to be, That thou might'st but tread on me. XXI. [Reach me here that full crown'd Cup] Reach me here that full crown'd Cup, And at once I'le drink it up; For my overcharged Breast Pants for drowth, with care opprest; Whilst a Chaplet of cool Roses My distemper'd Brow incloses; Love I'le drench in Wine; for these Flames alone can his appease. The Invitation. XXII. Come my Fair, the heat t'evade Let us sit beneath this shade; See, the Tree doth bow his head, And his armes t'invite thee spread; Hark, the kinde perswasive Spring Murmurs at thy tarrying; Who molested by the Sun Would so sweet a refuge shun? XXIII. [If I thought that Gold had power] If I thought that Gold had power To prolong my Life one hour, I should lay it up, to fee Death, when come to summon me; But if Life cannot be bought, Why complain I then for nought? Death not brib'd at any price, To what end is Avarice? Fill me then some Wine; but see That it brisk and racy be, Such as may cold bloods inflame, For by Bacchus arm'd, wee'l aime At Cythera's highest pleasure; Wine and Love's the onely treasure. XXIV. [I am sprung of humane seed] I am sprung of humane seed, For a lives short race decree'd; Though I know the way I've gone, That which is to come's unknown; Busie thoughts do not disturb me; What have you to do to curb me? Come, some Wine and Musick give; Ere we dye, 'tis fit we live. XXV. [VVhen with Wine my soul is arm'd] VVhen with Wine my soul is arm'd, All my grief and tears are charm'd; Life in toils why should we wast, When we're sure to dye at last? Drink we then, nor Bacchus spare; Wine's the Antidote of Care. XXVI. [VVhen my sense in Wine I steep] VVhen my sense in Wine I steep, All my cares are lull'd asleep: Rich in thought, I then despise Cræsus, and his royalties: Whilst with Ivy twines I wreath me, And sing all the World beneath me; Others run to martial fights, I to Bacchus's delights; Fill the cup then Boy, for I Drunk then dead had rather ly. XXVII. [Jove born Bacchus when possest] Jove born Bacchus when possest (Care exiling) of my breast, In a sprightly Saraband Guides my foot and ready hand, Which an even measure sets 'Twixt my voice and Castanets; Tir'd we sit and kiss; and then To our dancing fall agen. The Picture. XXVIII. Painter, by unmatch'd desert Master of the Rhodian art, Come, my absent Mistresse take As I shall describe her; make First her Hair, as black as bright, And if colours so much right Can but do her, let it too Smell of Aromatick dew; Underneath this Shade, must thou Draw her Alabaster Brow; Her dark Eye-brows so dispose That they neither part nor close. But by a divorce so slight Be disjoyn'd, may cheat the sight: From her kindly killing Eye Make a flash of lightning flye, Sparkling like Minerva's, yet Like Cythera's mildly sweet: Roses in milk swimming seek For the pattern of her Cheek: In her lip such moving blisses As from all may challenge kisses; Round about her neck (outvying Parian stone) the Graces flying; And o're all her Limbs at last A loose purple mantle cast, But so ordered that the eye Some part naked may descry, An Essay by which the rest That lies hidden may be ghest. So; to life th'hast come so neer All of her, but voice, is here. Another. XXIX. Draw my Fair as I command, Whilst my fancy guides thy hand. Black her hair must be, yet bright, Tipt, as with a golden light, In loose curls thrown o're her Dresse With a graceful carelessnesse; On each side her forehead crown With an Arch of Sable down; In her black and sprightly Eye Sweetness mix with Majesty, That the soul of every Lover There 'twixt hope and fear may hover: In her Cheek a blushing red Must by Bashfulness be spread; Such her lips as if from thence Stole a silent Eloquence: Round her Face, her Forehead high, Neck surpassing Ivory; But why all this care to make Her description need we take? Draw her with exactest Art After Venus in each part; Or to Samos go, and there Venus thou mayst draw by Her. Love imprison'd. XXX. Love, in Rosy Fetters caught, To my Fair the Muses brought; Gifts his Mother did prefer To release the Prisoner; But hee'd not be gone though free, Pleas'd with his Captivity. XXXI. [Prethee trouble me no more] Prethee trouble me no more; I will drink, be mad, and rore: Alcmæ'on and Orestes grew Mad, when they their Mothers slew: But I no man having kill'd Am with hurtless fury fill'd; Hercules with madness strook Bent his Bow, his Quiver shook; Ajax mad, did fiercely wield Hectors Sword, and graspt his Shield: I nor Spear nor Target have, But this Cup (my weapon) wave: Crown'd with roses, thus for more Wine I call, drink, dance, and rore. The Accompt. XXXII. If thou dost the number know Of the Leaves on every Bough, If thou canst the reck'ning keep Of the Sands within the Deep; Thee of all men will I take, And my Loves Accomptant make. Of Athenians first a score Set me down; then fifteen more: Adde a Regiment to these of Corinthian Mistresses; For the most renown'd for fair In Achæa, sojourn there; Next our Lesbian beauties tell; Those that in Ionia dwell; Those of Rhodes and Caria count; To two thousand they amount. Wonder'st thou I love so many? 'Lass of Syria we not any, Ægypt yet, nor Creet have told, Where his Orgies Love doth hold. What to those then wilt thou say Which in Eastern Bactria, Or the Western Gades remain? But give o're, thou toilst in vain; For the Sum which thou dost seek Puzzels all Arithmetick. The Swallow. XXXIII. Gentle Swallow, thou we know Every year dost come and go, In the Spring thy nest thou mak'st; In the Winter it forsak'st, And divert'st thy self awhile Near the Memphian Towers, or Nile; But Love in my suff'ring breast Builds, and never quits his nest; First one Love's hatcht; when that flies In the shell another lies; Then a third is half expos'd; Then a whole brood is disclos'd, Which for meat still peeping cry, Whilst the others that can fly Do their callow brethren feed, And grown up, they young ones breed. What then will become of me, Bound to pain incessantly, Whilst so many Loves, conspire Or by heart by turns to tire! XXXIV. [Though my aged head be gray] Though my aged head be gray And thy youth more fresh then May, Fly me not; oh rather see In this wreath how gracefullie Roses with pale Lillies joyne, Learn of them, so let us twine. Europa. XXXV. This the figure is of Jove, To a Bull transform'd by Love, On whose back the Tyrian Maid Through the Surges was convaid: See how swiftly he the wide Sea doth with strong hoofs divide; He (and he alone) could swim, None o'th' Heard ere follow'd him. XXXVI. [Vex no more thy self and me] Vex no more thy self and me With demure Philosophy; Hollow precepts, onely fit To amuse the busie wit; Teach me brisk Lyeus rites; Teach me Venus blithe delights; Jove loves Water, give me Wine; That my soul ere I resigne May this cure of sorrow have; There's no drinking in the Grave. The Spring. XXXVII. See the Spring her self discloses, And the Graces gather Roses: See how the becalmed Seas Now their swelling waves appease; How the Duck swims, how the Crane Comes from's Winter Home again; See how Titans cheerful ray Chaceth the dark Clouds away; Now in their new robes of green Are the Plowmans labours seen: Now the lusty teeming Earth Springs each hour with a new birth; Now the Olive blooms: the Vine Now doth with plump pendants shine; And with leaves and blossoms now Freshly bourgeons every Bough. XXXVIII. [Old I am, yet can (I think)] Old I am, yet can (I think) Those that younger are out-drink; When I dance no staff I take But a well fill'd Bottle shake: He that doth in war delight Come and with these arms let's fight; Fill the Cup, let loose a flood Of the rich Grapes luscious blood; Old I am, and therefore may Like Silenus drink and play. XXXIX. [When I ply the cheering Bowl] When I ply the cheering Bowl Brisk Lyæus through my soul Strait such lively joy diffuses That I sing, and bless the Muses; Full of Wine I cast behinde All my sorrows to the winde; Full of Wine my head I crown Roving loosely up and down; Full of Wine I praise the life Calmly ignorant of strife; Full of Wine I court some Fair, And Cythera's worth declare; Full of Wine my close thoughts I To my Jovial Friends unty: Wine makes Age with new years sprout: Wine deni'd, my life goes out. The Bee. XL. Love, a Bee that lurkt among Roses saw not, and was stung: Who for his hurt finger crying, Running sometimes, sometimes flying, Doth to his fair Mother hie, And oh help cries he, I dy; A wing'd Snake hath bitten me, Call'd by Countreymen a Bee: At which Venus, if such smart A Bees little sting impart, How much greater is the pain They whom thou hast hurt sustain. XLI. [VVhilst our Joyes with wine we raise] VVhilst our Joyes with wine we raise Youthful Bacchus we will praise: Bacchus dancing did invent; Bacchus is on songs intent; Bacchus teacheth Love to court, And his Mother how to sport; Graceful confidence He lends; He oppressive trouble ends; To the Bowle when we repair Grief doth vanish into air; Drink we then, and drown all sorrow; All our care not knows the morrow; Life is dark, let's dance and play, They that will be troubled may; We our joyes with wine will raise, Youthful Bacchus we will praise. XLII. [I divine Lyeus prize] I divine Lyeus prize, Who with mirth and wit supplies: Compast with a Jovial Quire, I affect to touch the Lyre: But of all my greatest Joy Is with sprightly Maids to toy: My free heart no Envy bears, Nor anothers envy fears; Proof against invective wrongs, Brittle shafts of pois'nous tongues. Wine with quarrels sowr'd I hate, Or feasts season'd with debate: But I love a harmless Measure; Life; to Quiet hath no pleasure. The Grassehopper. XLIII. Grasshopper thrice-happy! who Sipping the cool morning dew, Queen-like chirpest all the day Seated on some verdant spray; Thine is all what ere earth brings, Or the howrs with laden wings; Thee, the Ploughman calls his Joy, 'Cause thou nothing dost destroy: Thou by all art honour'd; All Thee the Springs sweet Prophet call; By the Muses thou admir'd, By Apollo art inspir'd, Agelesse, ever singing, good, Without passion flesh or blood, Oh how near thy happy state Comes the Gods to imitate! The Dream. XLIII. As I late in slumber lay Wing'd me thought I ran away, But Love (his feet clogg'd with Lead) As thus up and down I fled Following caught me instantly: What may this strange dream imply? What but this? that in my heart Though a thousand Loves had part, I shall now (their snares declin'd) To this onely be confin'd. Loves Arrows. XLIV. In the Lemnian Forge of late Vulcan making Arrows sate; Whilst with Honey their barb'd points Venus, Love with Gall anoints: Armed Mars by chance comes there, Brandishing a sturdy Spear, And in scorn the little shaft Offring to take up, he laught: This (saith Love) which thou dost slight Is not (if thou try it) light; Up Mars takes it, Venus smil'd; But He (sighing) to the Child Take it, cries, its weight I feel; Nay (sayes Love) e'en keep it still. Gold. XLVI. Not to love a pain is deem'd, And to love's the same esteem'd: But of all the greatest pain Is to love unlov'd again; Birth in love is now rejected, Parts and Arts are disrespected, Onely Gold is look'd upon; A curse take him that was won First to doat upon it; hence Springs 'twixt Brothers difference; This makes Parents slighted; this Wars dire cause and fuel is: And what's worst, by this alone Are we Lovers overthrown. XLVII. [Young Men dancing, and the old] Young Men dancing, and the old Sporting I with joy behold; But an old Man gay and free Dancing most I love to see: Age and youth alike he shares, For his Heart belies his Haires. XLVIII. [Bring me hither Homers Lute] Bring me hither Homers Lute, Taught with mirth (not wars) to suit; Reach a full Cup, that I may All the laws of Wine obey, Drink, and dance, and to the Lyre Sing what Bacchus shall inspire. XLIX. [Best of Painters come, pursue] Best of Painters come, pursue What our Muse invites thee to, And Lyeus, whose shrill Flute Vies with her harmonious Lute; Draw me a full City, where Several shapes of mirth appear; And the Laws of Love, if cold Wax so great a flame can hold. L. [VVho his cups can stoutly bear] VVho his cups can stoutly bear, In his cups despiseth fear, In his cups can nimbly dance, Him Lyeus will advance: Nectar of us mortals Wine, The glad off-spring of the Vine, Skreen'd with leaves, preserv'd within The plump Grapes transparent skin, In the Body all diseases, In the Soul all grief appeases. On a Basin wherein Venus was engrav'd. LI. VVhat bold hand the Sea engraves, Whilst its undetermin'd waves In a Dishes narrow Round Arts more powerful rage doth bound? See, by some Promethean Mind Cytherea there design'd, Mother of the Deities, Expos'd naked to our eyes In all parts, save those alone Modesty will not have shown, Which for covering onely have The thin Mantle of a wave: On the surface of the Main, Which a smiling calm layes plain, She, like frothy Sedges, swims And displayes her snowy Limbs: Whilst the foaming billow swells As her breast its force repells, And her form striving to hide Her doth by her Neck divide, Like a Lilly round beset By the Purple Violet; Loves, who Dolphins do bestride Ore the silver surges ride, And with many a wanton smile Lovers of their hearts beguile; Whilst the People of the Floud To her side, like Wantons, scud. The Vintage. LII. Men and Maids at time of year The Ripe clusters joyntly bear To the Press, but in when thrown They by Men are trod alone, Who in Bacchus praises join, Squeeze the Grape, let out the Wine: Oh with what delight they spy The new must when tun'd work high! Which if old Men freely take Their gray heads and heels they shake; And a young Man, if he finde Some fair Maid to sleep resign'd In the shade, He strait goes to her, Wakes, and roundly 'gins to woe her; Whilst Love slily stealing in Tempts her to the pleasing sin: Yet she long resists his offers, Nor will hear what ere he proffers, Till perceiving that his prayer Melts into regardless air, Her, who seemingly refrains, He by pleasing force constrains; Wine doth boldness thus dispence, Teaching young Men Insolence. The Rose. LIII. With the flowry Crowned Spring Now the Vernal Rose we sing; Sons of mirth, your sprightly layes Mix with ours, to sound its praise: Rose, the Gods and Mens sweet flower; Rose, the Graces Paramour; This of Muses the delight, This, is Venus Favourite; Sweet, when guarded by sharp Thorns; Sweet, when it soft hands adorns; How at mirthful boards admir'd! How at Bacchus Feasts desir'd! Fair without it what is born? Rosy finger'd is the Morn; Rosy arm'd the Nymphs we name, Rosy-cheek'd Loves Queen proclaim: This relief 'gainst sickness lends; This the very dead befriends; This Times Malice doth prevent, Old retains its Youthful Scent. When Cythera from the Main, Pallas sprung from Jove's crackt Brain, Then the Rose receiv'd it's Birth, From the youthful teeming Earth; Every God was its Protector, Watring it by turns with Nectar, Till from Thorns it grew, and prov'd Of Lyæus the belov'd. LIV. [When I see the young Men play] When I see the young Men play, Young me thinks I am as they; And my aged thoughts lay'd by, To the Dance, with Joy I fly: Come, a flowry Chaplet lend me, Youth, and mirthful thoughts attend me; Age be gone, wee'l dance among Those that young are and be young: Bring some Wine Boy, fill about; You shall see the old Man's stout; Who can laugh and tipple too, And be mad as well as you. LV. [Horses plainly are descry'd] Horses plainly are descry'd By the Mark upon their side: Parthians are distinguished By the Miters on their Head: But from all Men else a Lover I can easily discover, For upon his easie Breast Love his Brand-Mark hath imprest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BION. Epitaph on Adonis. Idyll. I. Adonis I lament; he's dead! the fair Adonis dead is! Loves his mourners are; Venus, no more in Scarlet coverings rest, Rise cloth'd in Black; &amp; beating thy sad breast, Adonis dead is, to the World declare; I wail Adonis, Loves his mourners are. On barren Mountains doth Adonis ly, A Boares white tusk hath gor'd his whiter thigh: His short Pants Venus grieve; black blood distains His snowy Skin, his Eye no life retains: The Rose is from his pale Lip fled, with it Died that dear Kiss which Venus nere will quit: His liveless kiss to Venus pleasing is, But dead Adonis not perceiv'd her kiss. I wail Adonis, Loves his mourners are. In young Adonis thigh a deep deep wound, But deeper far in Venus breast is found. His lov'd Hounds o're the Boy a howling keep, And all the mountain-Nymphs about him weep; Venus, with hair disshevel'd, through the groves Frantick, in loose attire and barefoot roves; About her legs the blood-stain'd brambles cling, And the wide valleys with her shrill cries ring, She calls her Boy, her lov'd Assyrian Spouse, Whilst bubling gore, sprung from his thigh, oreflows His breast; the whiteness which so late orespread His limbs, is now converted into red. I wail Adonis Loves his, &amp;c. Her beauty with her beauteous Spouse she lost Whilst her Adonis liv'd Venus could boast Her form; but that (alas) did with him dy: Mountains and Oaks, Ah poor Adonis cry; Rivers Cythera's miseries resent; And Fountains young Adonis losse lament; Flowers are with grief turn'd purple; all the Hills And City with her sad shrieks Venus fills Poor Venus thy Adonis murther'd lies! Adonis murther'd lies, Eccho replies. Thy hapless love tears from all eyes would draw; Soon as Adonis ghastly wound She saw, Soon as his thigh which bath'd in black gore lay, Spreading her arms She cries, Adonis stay, Hapless Adonis stay but till I twine Thee in my arms, and mix my lips with thine; Adonis wake so short a while, to give A dying kisse but whilst a kisse may live; Thy fleeting spirit to my breast bequeath, And I will suck Loves Nectar in thy breath, Thy love Ile drink, and in Adonis sted Will keep that kisse when thou unkinde art fled, Fled far Adonis, gone to Acheron To the deaf King, and I left all alone As Goddess am to follow thee denied. Take my Spouse Proserpine, thy power's more wide Then mine; to thee and Pluto all that's fair Devolves; unhappy Me lost in despair, Jealous of thee for my Adonis dead! He's dead, and like a dream our loves are fled. Venus a widow, Loves are Orphans now, My Cestus lost with Thee: why huntedst thou? To cope with beasts thy softness was not made: Thus Venus mourns whilst Loves her sorrows aid. Poor Venus thy Adonis murder'd lies! For every drop of blood he shed, her eyes Let fall a tear, which earth in flowers bestows, Tears rais'd th'Anemony and Blood the Rose. Adonis, dead Adonis I deplore; Venus thy husband wail in woods no more; A bed, a bed is for Adonis made; On thy bed Venus is Adonis layd; Lovely in death, dead lovely as in sleep; Down gently lay him, in soft coverings keep His body, wrapt in which he slept with thee On a guilt bed; unhappy though he be Neglect him not; 'mongst wreaths let him be laid, Not any flower but with his life did fade: In sweet Myrrhe-water wash each softer limb, The sweetness of all waters dy with him! In purple winding clothes Adonis lies, Whilst loves about him weep his obsequies, And strew him with their hair; His Bow one kicks, His Shafts another; This his Quiver breaks; His shooe another looses; That stands by With a gold Bason, whilst this bathes his thigh; One sits behind, and fans him with his wings: Loves weep for Cytherea's sufferings. The wedding garment Hymen in the porch Cast quite away, and quench the genial torch: To Elegies our Hymenæals turn, We for Adonis, we for Hymen mourn: The Graces (griev'd for Cynara's fair son) Adonis, to each other say, is gone: Lowder then thine (Dione) are their cries; Adonis, in their songs the destinies Call back Adonis, but their lure disdain'd He never minds, by Proserpine detain'd. Dry thy eyes Venus for to day, and keep Some tears in store, for thou next yeer must weep. II. [A youth (a Fowler) in a shady Grove] A youth (a Fowler) in a shady Grove As he a birding went spied runaway Love Sitting upon a Box-tree branch, and glad (The Bird seem'd fair) that such a prize he had, His Gins he all in order doth bestow, Observing Love who skipt from bough to bough: Angry at last he watch'd so long in vain, To an old Husbandman who first did train Him in that Art he goes, and doth relate His frustrate sport, and shews him where Love sate. The old Man shook his hoary head and smil'd; Pursue (saith he) this Bird no longer Child; Fly, 'tis an evil beast, whom whilst you can Avoid thou happy art; but once grown Man He of himself, who now avoids thy search Will freely come, and on thy head will pearch. III. [In sleep before me Venus seem'd to stand] In sleep before me Venus seem'd to stand, Holding young Cupid in her whiter hand, His eyes cast on the ground; lov'd Swain I bring My son (saith she) to learn of thee to sing; Then disappeard; I my old pastoral layes Began, instructing Cupid in their wayes, How Pan the Pipe, Minerva found the Flute, Phœbus the Harp, and Mercury the Lute: He minds not what I sing, but sings agen His Mothers acts, the loves of Gods and Men: What I taught Cupid then, I now forget; But what he then taught me, remember yet. IV. [Fierce Love the Muses fear not, but affect] Fierce Love the Muses fear not, but affect, And gladly by his steps their own direct; If One whose Genius is not am'rous try To sing him they, to teach refusing, fly; But if some Lover his sweet song begin, To him they joyfully come thronging in; This witnesse the disorder of my tongue When God or Man is subject of my song But Love and Lycidas; what I compose Of them in streams of verse untroubled flows. V. [If good my verses are, they will augment] If good my verses are, they will augment By fame the life which Fate already lent; If bad why longer do I toyl in vain? Could we indeed a double life obtain Of Jove or his successive Destinie, That this for pleasure, that for toyl might be, Then might we reap the Joyes our Labours sow: But since the Gods Man but one life allow, And that more short then other things acquire, Ah why our selves with labour do we tire? How long to Gain and Arts will we apply Our studies, and still more, more riches cry? We have forgot that we all mortal are, And what a little part of time we share. Cleodemus, Myrson. VI. Cleod. Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, w?? delight Thee most? w?? (Myrson) should thy wish invite? Doth Winter, when the Earth left unmanur'd Men are by sloth unto the fire allur'd, Or fairer Spring best please thee? say which fits Thy choice? our want of businesse talk permits. Myr. Men must not censure what the Gods create; Delightful and divine is every state; But thou shalt know with which I most am won; Not Summer, for the scorching of the Sun, Nor Autumn, for th'unwholsomnesse of fruit, Nor Winter, for its snows with me doth suit. Lov'd Spring be all the year! when no excesse Of heat or cold our spirits doth oppresse; In Spring are all things fruitful, all things sweet, Then nights and dayes in even measure meet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MOSCHVS. Love Cried. Idyll. I. Her lost son Cupid careful Venus cried; If any in the streets Love wandring spied, He is my runaway, to Venus come And have a kisse; but he that brings him home Not a meer kisse shall have but further Joyes; Hee's easie to be known from twenty Boyes; Fiery, not white is his Complexion; Eyes Sparkling; fair words his treacherous thoughts disguise. His Lips and Heart dissent; like Honey sweet His tongue, in's minde malice and anger meet: A crafty lying Boy, mischief his play, Curl'd headed, knavish-look'd; no little way His hand, though little, can an arrow throw; To Hell he shoots, and wounds the Powers below. His body he disrobes, his minde he covers, And like a swift bird up and down he hovers From Man to Woman, pearching on the heart: A little Bow he hath, a little Dart, Whose nimble flight can pierce the highest sphears, A golden Quiver at his back he bears, And poison'd Shafts, with which he doth not spare Ev'n Me to wound: All cruel, cruel are; But most his little Torch, which fires the Sun; Take, bring him bound, nor be to pitty won; Let not his tears thy easinesse beguile, Nor let him circumvent thee with a smile; If he to kisse thee ask, his kisses fly; Poyson of Asps between his lips doth ly: If to resigne his weapons he desire, Touch not, his treacherous Gifts are dipt in fire. Europa. II. A sweet dream Venus once Europa lent, In nights third quarter, near the morns ascent; Whilst slumber which her eyelids sweetly crown'd, Her limbs unti'd, and her eyes softly bound (That time which doth all truer dreams beget.) Europa Phœnix-child, a Virgin yet, Alone in a high chamber taking rest, Beholds two Countries that for her contest, The Asian and her opposite; both seem'd Like women; that a stranger, this esteem'd A native who (a Mother like) doth plead That she of her was born, by her was bred; The other violent hands upon her laid, And drew by force the unresisting Maid, Urging she was as prize to Jove design'd: Out of the bed she starts with troubled minde: And panting heart; the dream to life's so near: Long sate she silent; long both women were After she wak'd presented to her sense, Till thus at length she breaks her deep suspence. Which of the Gods as now I did repose, Perplext my fancy with delusive showes? My calmer sleeps disquieting with fear: What Stranger in my slumber did appear? Her love shot suddenly into my breast And kindnesse like a Mother she exprest. The Gods vouchsafe this dream a good event! She rose and for her lov'd companions sent, In years and friendship equal nobly born With them for Balls she us'd her self t'adorn; Or in Anaurus current baths, with them She plucks the fragrant Lilly from her stem; These straight come to her; each a basket held To gather flowers; so walk they to a field Neighb'ring to th'Sea, whither they often went Pleas'd with the Waters noise and Roses scent. A golden basket fair Europa bare, Rich yet in Vulcans workmanship more rare, Which Neptune first to Lybia gave when he Obtain'd her bed, to Telephassa she Wife to her son, from Telephassa last This to unwed' Europe her daughter past Which many figures neatly wrought did hold. Inachian Io was here carv'd in gold, Not yet in Womans shape, but like a Cow, Who seem'd to swim, and force (enraged) through The briny Sea her way; the Sea was blew; Upon the highest point of land to view The wave-dividing Heifer, two Men stand; Jove strokes the wet Cow with his sacred hand, Who unto seven mouth'd Nilus crossing over, doth cast her horns, and Womans shape recover. In silver Nilus flood, the Cow in brass, And Jupiter in gold engraven was; Mercury's figur'd on the furthest round, And next him lies distended on the ground Argos endu'd with many watchful eyes, Out of whose purple blood a Bird doth rise, Proud of his various flowry plumes, his tail He spreadeth like a swift ship under sail, And comprehends the border with his wings; Such is the basket fair Europa brings. All at the painted field arive, where these With several flowers their several fancies please. One sweet Narcissus plucks, another gets Wild Savory, Hyacinths, and Violets, Many faln spring-born flowers the ground doth share, Some strive which yellow Crocus fragrant hair Should faster pluck; i'th' midst the Queen doth stand Gathering the Roses beauty with her hand; The Graces so by Venus are out-shin'd. Nor must she long with flowers divert her mind, Nor long preserve unstain'd her Virgin zone, For Jove upon the Meadow looking down, By Venus subtle darts was struck in love, Venus hath power to captivate great Jove. Who of frowr'd Juno's jealousie afraid, And that he might deceive the tender Maid, In a Bulls shape his deity doth vail, Not such as are in stables bred, or trail The crooked plough the furrow'd earth to wound, Or run amongst the heards in pasture ground, Or are to draw the laden Waggon us'd. Yellow o're all his body is diffus'd, Save a white circle shines amidst his brow. His brighter eyes with amorous sparkles glow. His horns with equal length rise from his head Like the Moons orb, to half a circle spread. Into the Mead he comes, nor (seen) doth fright The Virgins to approach him all delight, And stroke the lovely Bull, whose divine smell Doth far the Meads perfumed breath excell: Before unblam'd Europa's feet he stood Licking her neck, and the Maid kindly woo'd: She stroak'd and kiss'd him; and the foam that lay Upon his lip wip'd with her hand away: He softly bellow'd, such a humming sound Forth breathing as Mygdonian Pipes resound. Down at her feet he kneels viewing the Maid With writhed neck, and his broad back displai'd, When she to th'fair-haird Virgins thus doth say; Come hither dear companions, let us play, Securely with this Bull, and without fear; Who like a Ship all on his back will bear. He tame appears to sight, and gently kind, Diff'ring from others, a discursive mind Bearing like Men, and onely voice doth lack. This said, she smiling gets upon his back; Which the rest off'ring, the Bull leaps away, And to the Sea bears his desired prey; She cals with stretch'd out hands, she turns to view Her friends, alas unable to pursue; Down leaps he, Dolphin-like glides through the Seas: Up from the deep rise the Nereides, Mounted on Whales to meet her on the way: Whilst hollow-sounding Neptune doth allay The waves, and is himself his brothers guide In this Sea-voyage; Tritons on each side, (The deeps inhabitants) about him throng, And sound with their long shels a nuptial song; She by transformed Jupiter thus born, With one hand holding fast the Bulls large horn Her purple garment with the other saves Unwet by the swoln Oceans froathy waves: Her mantle (flowing o're her shoulders swell'd Like a full sail, and the young maid upheld. Now born away far from her native coast, Her sight the wave-washt shore and mountains lost She sees the Heav'ns above, the Seas beneath, And looking round about these cries doth breath. O whither sacred Bull? who art thou, say? That through undreaded floods canst break thy way: The Seas are pervious to swift ships alone, But not to Bulls is their fear'd voyage known; What food is here? or if some God thou be Why dost what misbeseems a Deity? Upon the Land no Dolphins, no Bulls move Upon the Sea; Thou sea and land dost prove Alike; whose feet like Oares assist thy hast; Perhaps thou'lt soar through the bright air at last On high, and like the nimble Birds become. Me most unhappy, who have left my home, A Bull to follow, voyages unknown To undertake, and wander all alone. But Neptune thou that rul'st the foaming Main Be pleas'd to help me; sure I shall obtain A sight of this great God who is my guide, Nor else could I these fluid paths have tride. The largely horned Bull thus answer'd; Maid Be bold, nor of the swelling waves afraid, For I am Jove who now a Bull appear, And whatsoever shape I please can wear; In this to measure the wide Sea constrain'd For love of thee, thou shalt be entertain'd By Creet my Nurse; our nuptials shall be there Perform'd, and thou of me great sons shalt bear, To whose imperious scepters all shall bow. What he had said event made good; Creet now Appears in view; Jove his own form doth take, And loos'd her zone; the howers their bed did make, She late a Virgin, Spouse to Jove became, Brought him forth sons, and gaind a mothers name. Epitaph on Bion the Pastoral Poet. III. Mourn, and your grief ye Groves in soft sighs breath, Ye Rivers drop in tears, for Bions death: His losse ye Plants lament, ye Woods bewaile Ye Flowers your odours with your griefs exhale; In purple mourn, Anemony and Rose; Breath Hyacinth that sigh, and more, which grows Upon thy cheek; the sweet voic'd Singers gone: Begin Sicilian Muse, begin your mone. Ye Nightingales that mourn on thickest boughs, Tell gentle Arethusa's stream which flows Through Sicily, Bion the Shepherds dead, And with him Poetry and Musick fled. Begin Sicilian, &amp;c. Strimonian Swans vent from your mournful throats (Gliding upon the waves such dying notes As heretofore in you the Poet sung; Tell the Oeagrian, tell the Thracian young Virgins, the Dorick Orpheus hence is gone; Begin Sicilian Muse, begin your mone. He never more shall pipe to his lov'd flock, Laid underneath some solitary Oak, But songs of Lethe now, by Pluto taught; The Hils are dumb; the Heifers that late sought The Bull lament, and let their meat alone. Begin Sicilian Muse, begin your mone. Apollo wept thy death, thy silenc'd reeds Satyrs Priapusses in mourning weeds And Fawns bewail: 'mongst woods the Nymphs that dwell In fountains weep, whose tears to fountains swell; Eccho 'mongst rocks her silence doth deplore, Nor words (now thine are stopt) will follow more; Flowers fade; abortive fruit falls from the trees; The Ews no Milk, no Honey give the Bees, But wither'd combs; the sweetness being gone Of thy lov'd voice, Honey itself hath none. Begin Sicilian Muse begin your mone. So Dolphin never wail'd upon the strand; So never Nightingale on craggy land; So never Swallow on the mountains mourn'd; Nor Halcyons sorrows Ceyx so return'd. Begin Sicilian, &amp;c. So Cerylus on blew waves never sung; In Eastern vales, the bird from Memnon sprung Aurora's son so mourn'd not, hovering o're His Sepulcher, as Bion they deplore. Begin Sicilian, &amp;c. Swallows and Nightingales, whom he to please Once taught to sing, now sitting on high trees Sing forth their grief in parts, the rest reply, And Doves with murmuring keep them company. Begin Sicilian, &amp;c. Who now can use thy Pipe, or dare betray Such boldness to thy Reeds his lips to lay? They yet are by thy lips and breath inspir'd, And Eccho thence hath harmony acquir'd; Pan keeps thy Pipe, but will its use decline, Fearing to prove his own skill short of thine. Begin Sicilian, &amp;c. Thee Galathea wails, whom heretofore Thy songs delighted sitting on the shore: The Cyclop sung not so; She through the Sea (Though him she fled) darred kind looks at Thee; And now in desert sands she sits, the deep Forsaking quite, and doth thy Oxen keep. Begin Sicilian, &amp;c. With thee (lov'd Swain) dy all the Muses joyes, The kisses of young Maids and amorous Boyes; The Cupids weep about thy Sepulcher; Thee Venus did beyond the kisse prefer Which from Adonis dying she receiv'd. Thou hast new cause great River to be griev'd, New sorrow Melus: Homer first by death Was seiz'd (Calliopes harmonious breath) Then thy fair Son thy troubled waves deplor'd, And over all the Sea their current roar'd; Thou now must languish for another Son: Both Fountains lov'd; the Pegasæan One, The other courted Arethusa's spring: One did of Tyndarus fair Daughter sing, Thetis great Son, and Menelaus wrong; Nor wars nor tears, Pan was the others song, And Shepherds: As he sung he us'd to feed His flock, milk Cows, or carve an oaten reed, Taught the Youth courtship, in his bosom love He nurs'd, and Venus onely did approve. Begin Sicilian, &amp;c. Thy death each City every Town resents; Above her Hesiod Ascra thee laments; Lesse Pindar by Boetian woods is lov'd; Lesse with Alcæus fate was Lesbus mov'd; Their Poets losse lesse griev'd the Ceian town; Parus lesse love t'Archilochus hath shown; Thy verse 'bove Sapphos Mytilene admires; All whom th'indulgence of the Muses fires With pastoral heat, bewail thy sad decease; The Samian glory mourns, Sicelides; Amongst Cydonians (whose late mirth their pride) Licidas weeps; his grief by Hales tide Philetas, 'mongst Triopians, doth diffuse, Theocritus 'mongst those of Syracuse; And with Ausonian grief my verse is fraught; Such thy own Scholers by thy self were taught, Who as thy heirs claim Dorik poesie; Thy wealth to others, verse thou left'st to me. Begin Sicilian, &amp;c. Alas though time the garden Mallows kill, The verdant Smallage and the flowry Dill, Yet these revive, and new the next year rise; But Man, though ne're so great, so strong, so wise, Once dead, inclos'd in hollow earth must keep A long, obscure, inexcitable sleep. And thou art thus laid silent in the ground; For thy sweet voice we onely hear the sound Of the hoarse Frogs unintermitted grone. Begin Sicilian Muse, begin your mone. Cam'st thou by Poyson Bion to thy death? Scapt that the Antidote of thy sweet breath? What cruel Man to thee could poyson bear? Against thy musick sure he stopt his ear. Begin Sicilian, &amp;c. But a just vengeance is reserv'd for all; Mean time, with others, I bewail thy fall, Might I like Orpheus view the states below, And like Alcides, or Ulisses go To Pluto's court, I would enquire if there To him thou singst, &amp; what thou singst would hear; Court Her with some Sicilian past'ral strain, Who sporting on Sicilian Ætna's plain Sung Dorik laies; thine may successful be, And as once Orpheus brought Euridice Thee back perphaps they to these hills may bring, Had I such skill to Pluto I would sing. Megara and Alcmena. IV. Why these afflictions (Mother) dost thou seek? Thy fresh complexion hath forsook thy cheek; Why do thy sorrows past all limits run? Is't, that a worthlesse Man thy worthy son Oppresseth, as a Lion stoops t'a Hind? Alass why was I by the Gods design'd, by parents why begot to such hard fate? I met in marriage with a noble Mate, One whom as deer as my own eyes I deem'd, And still is by my soul no less esteem'd; But through like miseries none ever past, Nor did as he so bitter sorrows tast: Who with a fatal Bow by Phœbus sent, And arrows by some cursed Fury lent, The lives of his dear children did divide, His hands in blood, his soul in fury di'de; These by their Father slain I saw, a deed, Had I not view'd it, would belief exceed: Nor could I, though call'd often, lend them aid, Whom death inevitable did invade: As a Bird mourns that sees her young distrest, And ready to be swallow'd in the nest By some fell Snake, the pious old One over Their heads (alass in vain) doth shrieking hover; Help she is able to afford them none, And to come neer, their danger were her own; So hapless Mother, up and down I went Enrag'd, and my dear children did lament; Would I had kept them company in death, And by a poison'd arrow lost my breath From vext Diana, who our Sex commands! With tears and funeral rites, then the dear hands Of parents in one Pyre had help'd to burn, And all our bones clos'd in one golden Urn; Our birth and burial owing to one place; They're now at Thebes, fam'd for a generous race Of steeds; or fat grounds of Aonia plow; Whilst I in Tyrins Juno's City bow Beneath the weight of an unbounded grief, Nor intermission gives my tears relief: My husband I so little see at home; So many labours must he overcome; Great toyls by Sea and Land hath he outgrown; The manly heart his breast contains of stone, Or steel is fram'd: Thou melt'st in tears away, And by thy sorrows count'st each night and day: Yet other friend for comfort have I none, To remote countries all the rest are gone, Their seats beyond the wooddy Isthmus ly; Nor yet of them knew I to whom to fly, To ease the passion of my troubled breast, Except my sister Pyrrha, who's opprest With the same grief for Iphiclus thy son Her husband through like toils thy children run, Though one a God begot, t'other a Man. This said, down her soft cheeks &amp; white brest ran A stream of tears, which her fair eyes let fall When sons and parents she to mind did call: Nor lesse Alcmena did bedew her cheek, And with a deep-fetcht sigh she first did break Way for her words; then to her daughter said, Crost in thy children, what sad thoughts invade Thy soul! why griev'st us both with the review Of troubles past? these sorrows are not new. Each day with such fresh cause our grief supplies, That he must be well verst in miseries Whose skill should undertake to sum up ours: But droop not daughter, these the heavenly powers Sent not; thy lively spirit grief destroyes, Nor can I blame; even joy excessive cloyes: Yet thy misfortunes I commiserate, Make a sad partner in the hapless fate Which on my wretched head threatens to fall; I Proserpine and neat-vail'd Ceres call To witness, who on perjur'd souls severe Vengeance inflict, thou art to me as dear As if thou hadst thy being from my wombe, And I had bred thee of a childe at home: I know lov'd daughter thou believ'st no less; Think me not unconcern'd in thy distress: No, should I fair-hair'd Niobe out-weep, A Mother justly for a Son may keep Her griefs awake; him ten long moneths before I ever saw near to my heart I bore: To Pluto's gates he almost brought me, pain So great I in my labour did sustain. But now he's gone away, more proofs to show Of valour, whilst unhappy I not know If him these arms shall evermore inclose. Besides a strange dream broke my sweet repose; Me thought that Hercules my Son did stand Before me with a Pickax in his hand; (As being hir'd to compass with a ditch A fruitful field by various flowers made rich) Naked, his Lions skin aside was laid; At last of all his task an end he made, And had enclos'd the Meadow with a mound, Then stuck his iron Pickax in the ground, When as he went to put his mantle on, Out of the earth a sudden lightning shone, And round about him flasht a dreadful fire, But with a leap he nimbly did retire, The active flame endeav'ring to evade, And shield-like 'gainst its rage oppos'd his Spade, Whilst round about he rowls his sparkling eyes To shun on every side the fires surprise; Straight (as I thought) did to his aid appear Stout Iphiclus, but ere he could come near Down falls he, and unable to arise, As a decrepid old man helpless lyes, Whom his declining years to fall compell, And keep him with their weight down where he fell, Till help'd up by some passenger that bears Respect to his weak age and silver hairs, So tumbled warlike Iphiclus, whilst I Wept to behold my children helpless ly; Till from my eyelids sleep were chac'd away, Aurora then arose to bring in day. With such illusions was my sleep all night Disturb'd, but on Euristheus may they light, Diverted from our house; to my desire With these prophetick dreams just fate conspire. V. [When still winds gently creep ore the blue Main] When still winds gently creep ore the blue Main, The calm allures me to the liquid plain; And less the Muses, then the Sea invite; But when the billows roar, when they grow white With breaking one another, and swell high, To land and trees back from the Sea I fly: Then trees, and safer land best please my mind; Where tall Pines sing, inspired by the wind; A dangerous life a Fisher leads! to float For so small purchase in his house a boat; Me sleep in shades by purling streams delights, Whose noise the labourer pleaseth, not affrights. VI. [Pan neighb'ring Eccho lov'd; Eccho desir'd] Pan neighb'ring Eccho lov'd; Eccho desir'd Brisk Satyrus, Satyrus Lyda fir'd; As Eccho Pan, Sa'trus did Eccho wound, And Lyda Satyrus, so love went round: As each did scorn for others love return, So justice paid their love with others scorn; Mark this disdainful Lover; would'st thou be Belov'd of those thou lov'st? love who love thee. VII. [Vesper, belov'd Cythera's golden light] Vesper, belov'd Cythera's golden light; Vesper, the sacred joy of Azure Night; Thou other Stars out-shin'st, as Cynthia Thee; Hail dearly welcome! come along with me, And with thy light our past'ral sports befriend; The Moon scarce up went down; I not intend To rob; no Travellours shall of me complain; I love and lovers should be lov'd again. VIII. [From Pisa cross the Sea Alpheus straies] From Pisa cross the Sea Alpheus straies, And with his Olive-fertile stream conveyes To Arethuse leaves, sacred ashes, flowers, Which headlong into hers his current poures: Under the Sea flowes his unmingled Tide, Nor knows the Sea what waves beneath him glide; Thus Love, that little Tyrant, can direct Rivers to swim to those whom they affect. Cupid Plowing. Epigram. Laying aside his Bow and Torch, a Whip Severe Love took, and at his side a Scrip; Then on the patient Oxen doth impose A Yoak, and in the fertile Furrow sows: And looking up, good weather Jove, or Thou (Saith he) Europa's Bull shalt draw my plow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">KISSES. I. [When Venus to Cythera's top convey'd] When Venus to Cythera's top convey'd Sleeping Ascanius, 'mongst soft violets layd, Showres of pale Roses on the Boy she strew'd, And with sweet Waters all the Place bedew'd; She then her old Adonian Fire retains, The well-known flame steals gently through her vains; How oft her Nephew offer'd she t'imbrace! How often said, such my Adonis was! But fearing to disturb his soft Repose, Thousands of Kisses on the Flowers bestows; The breath which from her Lip the Rose receives Whispers kinde Warmth into its glowing Leaves; And from her quickning Touch new Kisses rise, Whose ripe Encrease her full Joy multiplies Then round the Earth, the Goddess by a Pair Of milk-white Swans drawn through the fleeting Air, Sows Kisses all the way, and as they fell On the fat Glebe, thrice murmurs a Dark Spell. Hence a kinde Harvest for sick Lovers grows, Hence springs the onely cure of all my woes. Dear Kisses! you that scorched Hearts renew, Born of the Rose pregnant with sacred Dew, Upon your Poet deathless Verse distill, That may endure long as Medusa's Hill, Or whilst Love, mindfull still of Romes dear Race, Shall with his Numbers their soft Language grace. II. [As in a thousand wanton Curles the Vine] As in a thousand wanton Curles the Vine Doth the lov'd Elme embrace; As clasping Ivy round the Oak doth twine To kiss his leavy Face; So thou about my Neck thy Arms shalt fling, Joyning to mine thy Breast; So shall my Arms about thy fair Neck cling, My Lips on thine imprest. Ceres nor Bacchus, Care of Life nor Sleep Shall force me to retire; But we at once will on each others Lip Our mutual Souls expire. Then hand in hand down to th'Elïzian Plains (Crossing the Stygian Lake) Wee'l through those Fields where Spring eternal reigns Our pleasing Journey take. There their fair Mistresses the Heroes lead, And their old Loves repeat, Singing or dancing in a flowry Mead With Mirtles round beset. Roses and Violets smile beneath a Skreen Of ever verdant Bayes; And gentle Zephyr amorously between Their Leaves untroubled playes. There constantly the pregnant Earth unplow'd Her fruitful store supplies: When We come thither, all the happy Crowd From their green Thrones will rise. There Thou in Place above Joves numerous Train Of Mistresses shalt sit; Hers Hellen, Homer will not his disdain For Thee, and Me to quit. III. [A kiss I begg'd, and thou didst joyn] A kiss I begg'd, and thou didst joyn Thy Lips to mine; Then, as afraid snatch'd back their Treasure, And mock my pleasure; Again my Dearest! for in this Thou onely gav'st Desire, and not a Kiss. IV. [Tis no Kiss my Fair bestows] Tis no Kiss my Fair bestows; Nectar 'tis whence new Life flows; All the Sweets which nimble Bees In their Ozier Treasuries With unequall'd Art repose, In one Kiss her Lips disclose. These, if I should many take, Soon would me Immortal make, Rais'd to the divine Abodes, And the Banquets of the Gods. Be not then too lavish, Fair! But this heavenly Treasure spare, 'Less thou'lt too Immortal be: For without thy Companie, What to Me were the Abodes, Or the Banquets of the Gods? V. [When thou thy pliant Arms dost wreath] When thou thy pliant Arms dost wreath About my Neck, and gently breath Into my Breast that soft sweet Air With which thy Soul doth mine repair, When my faint Life thou draw'st away, My Life which scorching Flames decay, Orecharg'd my panting Bosom boyles, Whose Feavour thy kind Art beguiles, And with the Breath that did inspire Doth mildly fan my glowing Fire, Transported then I cry, above All other Deities is Love! Or if a Deity there be Greater then Love, 'tis onely Thee. VI. [Our Bargain for two thousand Kisses made] Our Bargain for two thousand Kisses made, A thousand I receiv'd, a thousand payd: The Number I confess thou hast supply'd, But Love with Number is not satisfy'd. None praise the Harvest who can count their Ears, Or sum the Blades of Grass the Meadow wears; Who for a hundred Clusters Bacchus fees? Or sues to Pales for a thousand Bees? When pious Jove waters the thirsty Plain, We number not the drops of falling Rain; Or when the troubled Air with Tempests quakes, And he displeas'd, in hand his fear'd Arms takes, At random on the Earth he scatters Hail, And Fruit or Corn securely doth assail: Or good or bad, Heavens Gifts exceed all Sum; A Majesty that doth Joves House become. Wilt thou dear Goddess then (more bright then she Who in a Shell sail'd through the smiling Sea) Kisses, thy heavenly Gifts, strictly confine To number, yet to count my Sighs decline? Or sum the Drops whose inexhausted Spring Flows from my Eyes, my pale Cheeks furrowing? If thou wilt reckon, reckon both together; If both thou number not, ah, number neither. Give me (to ease the Pain my griev'd Soul bears) Numberless Kisses, for unnumbred Tears. VII. [Kisses a hundred, hundred fold] Kisses a hundred, hundred fold, A hundred by a thousand told, Thousands by thousands numbred o're, As many thousand thousand more As are the Drops the Seas comprize, As are the Stars that paint the Skies, To this soft Cheek, this speaking Ey, This swelling Lip will I apply. But whilst on these my Kisses dwell Close as the Cockle clasps her shell, This swelling Lip I cannot spy, This softer Cheek, this speaking Eye: Nor those sweet Smiles, which (like the Ray Of Cynthius driving Clouds away) From my swoln Eyes dispel all Tears, From my sad Heart all jealous Fears. Alass! what Discontents arise Betwixt my æmulous Lips and Eyes! Can I with patience brook that Jove Should be a Partner in my Love, When my strict Eye the Rivalship Disdains to suffer of my Lip? VIII. [Not alwayes give a melting Kiss] Not alwayes give a melting Kiss, And Smiles with pleasing Whispers joyn'd; Nor alwayes extasi'd with Bliss About my Neck thy fair Arms wind. The wary Lover learns by measure To circumscribe his greatest joy; Lest, what well-husbanded yeilds pleasure, Might by the Repetition cloy. When thrice three Kisses I require, Give me but two, withhold the other; Such as cold Virgins to their Sire, Or chaste Diana gives her Brother. Then wantonly snatch back thy Lip, And smoothly, as sly Fishes glide Through Water giving me the slip, Thy self in some dark Corner hide. I'le follow Thee with eager haste And having caught (as Hawks their Pray) In my victorious Arm held fast Panting for Breath, bear thee away. Then thy soft Arms about me twin'd Thou shalt use all thy skill to please me, And offer all that was behind, The poor Seven Kisses, to appease me. How much mistaken wilt thou be! For seven times seven shalt thou pay, Whilst in my Arms I fetter Thee Lest thou once more should'st get away. 'Till I at last have made thee swear By all thy Beauty and my Love, That thou again the same severe Revenge for the same Crime would'st prove. IX. [I lay of Life by thee, my Life, bereav'd.] I lay of Life by thee, my Life, bereav'd. About thy Neck my Arms were loosely weav'd. Supplies of Breath my wasted Spirits fail, Nor could relieve my Heart with one fresh Gale: Styx now before my Eyes appeard, the dark Region, and aged Carons swarthy Bark; When thou upon my Lip a Kiss imprest Drawn from the depth of thy enlivening Brest: A Kiss, that call'd me from the Stygian Lake, And made the Ferryman go empty back: Ah! I mistook! he went not back alone, My mournful Shade along with him is gone; Part of thy Soul within this Body raigns, And friendly my declining Limbs sustains; Which of return impatient, roves about, Ransaking every Passage to get out; And if no kindness she from thee receive, Ev'n now her falling Tenement will leave. Come then, unite thy melting Lip to mine, And let one Spirit both our Breasts combine, 'Till in an Extasie of wild desire Together both our Breasts one Life expire. X. [Th' Idalian Boy his Arrow to the Head] Th' Idalian Boy his Arrow to the Head (Neæra) drew, ready to strike thee dead; But when thy Brow, and on thy Brow thy Hair, Thy Eyes quick restless Light; thy Cheeks more fair, Breasts whiter then his Mothers he did view, Away his wavering Hand the slack Shaft threw: Then to thy Arms with childish Joy he skips, Printing a thousand Kisses on thy Lips; Which Cyprian Spirits, and the Mirtles Juice Into thy Bosome gently did infuse; And by the Gods, and his fair Mother swore, He never would attempt to hurt thee more. Wonder We then thy Kisses are so sweet? Or why no Love thy cold Brest will admit? XI. [Thou then Latona's Star more bright] Thou then Latona's Star more bright, Fairer then Venus golden Light, A hundred Kisses pay; Many as Lesbia Gave and receiv'd from her glad Lover; As are the Graces round thee hover, Or Cupids that do skip About thy Cheek, and Lip; As lives and Deaths thy bright Eye wears; As many Hopes, as many Fears, Joyes interlin'd with Woe, Or sighs from Lovers flow; As many as the Darts, that on My Heart by the wing'd Boy are sown; As many as do ly In his gilt Armory; To these kinde Blandishments, with glad Whispers, and mirthful Dalliance add; With grateful Smiles, that may Our full Delight betray; As two Chaonian Turtles bill, And the soft Air with murmurs fill, When Winters rigid Snows Away young Zephyr blows; Rest on my Cheek in Extasie, Ready to close thy dying Eye; And as thou faint'st away Me to uphold thee pray: My Arms about thee I will twine; My warm to thy cold Bosome joyn, And call thee back from Death, With a long Kisses Breath: 'Till me like Fate of Life bereave, Who in that Kiss my Spirit leave, And as I sink away Thee to uphold me pray: Thy Arms about me thou shalt ty, Thy warm to my cold Breast apply, And summon me from Death With a long Kisses Breath. Thus let us Dear in mutual Joy The florid part of Time employ; For Age our Lives will waste; Sicknesse and Death make haste. XII. [In such a Colour as the Morning Rose] In such a Colour as the Morning Rose Doth water'd with the Tears of Night disclose The blushing Kisses of Neæra shine When they the humid Print retain of mine; Round which the Beauties of her Face beset, As when some white hand crops a Violet; As Flowers with Cherries, that together wear The Spring and Summers Livery, appear. Unhappy! why now when thy kinde Lip warms My Soul, am I constrain'd to quit thy Arms? This Crimson Treasure ah reserve for Me, Till Night return and bring Me back to Thee; But if mean-time they any other seek, May they become far paler then my Cheek. XIII. [Neæra's Lips, (to which adds Grace] Neæra's Lips, (to which adds Grace The ambient Whiteness of her Face, As Coral Berries smiling ly Within their Case of Ivory) When Venus saw, she wept, and all Her little Loves did to her call. What boots it (cries she) that on Ide From Pallas and Joves Sister-Bride My Lips the glorious Prize did gain By judgement of the Phrygian Swain, If now another Arbiter Neæra's may to mine prefer? Go, spend upon him every Dart, Empty your Quivers on his Heart; But into hers a Frost, that may Congeal her youthful veins, convey. This scarce was spoke, but strait I felt My Soul in a soft Flame to melt; Whilst thy white Breast, which far outgoes In coldness Winters sharpest Snows, In hardness Adria's stubborn Rocks, Thy suffering Lover safely mocks. Ungrateful, for those Lips am I Tormented thus, nor know'st thou why Thou hat'st, or what Effects may rise From discontented Deities: Remit thy Anger, and assume A smile that may thy Cheek become; Thy Lips (of all my Misery The onely Cause) to mine apply; And from my scorching Bosom draw A warmth that may thy Coldness thaw; Jove fear not, nor Cythera's hate; Beauty controls the Power of Fate. XIV. [Ye wing'd Confectioners; why Thyme and Roses] Ye wing'd Confectioners; why Thyme and Roses The Sweets the vernal Violet discloses Why suck ye, or the breath of flowry Dill? Come, at my Mistresse Lips your soft Bags fill: Thym, and the Scent of Roses they produce, The vernal Violets Nectarean Juice: The blooming Dills sweet Breath far off they spred, They're steept in the true Tears Narcissus shed, And bath'd in Hyacinthus fragrant Blood, Such, as when falling in a mixed flood Of heav'nly Nectar; whilst the blended showre Rais'd from the Earth a party-colour'd flowre. But when I come to taste these Joyes with you, Do not, ungrateful! drive me from my Due, Nor greedy with your store stretch every Hive Lest of all sweetness you her Lips deprive And in her next (insipid) Kisses, I Finde the reward of my Discovery Nor wound her soft Lips with your little Darts, Wounds far more deadly her bright Eye imparts: Believ't, your wrongs will never pass forgot; Suck Honey gently thence but sting her not.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CUPID CRUCIFIED. Ausonius to his Son G. In th'aery fields by Maro's muse displai'd, Where myrtle groves the frantick lovers shade, The Heroines their Orgies celebrate, And past occasions of their deaths relate; As in a spreading Wood scarce pierc'd by day They 'mongst thin reeds and drooping Poppy stray; Lakes without fall, and Rivers without noyse, Upon whose banks sad flowers, by names of boyes And Kings once known, ith' cloudy twilight wither; Selfelov'd lov'd Narcissus, Hyacinth, together With Crocus golden hair'd, Adonis drest In purple, Ajax with a sigh imprest; These, who in tears their loves unhappy state (Though dead) with constant grief commemorate, Times past unto the Ladies represent; Her birth of Thunder Seme'le doth lament, And waves the seeming lightnings lazy fire Deceiv'd in which she pregnant did expire. Cænis who joy'd in change of Sex, deplor'd Her frustrate gifts, back to her first restor'd. Procris still dries her wounds, affecting thus Though hurt, the bloody hand of Cephalus. The maid faln from the Sestian Towers steep height Brings the pale Tapers dim and smoaky light. Masculine Sappho from dark Leucal's crown, Wounded with Lesbian shafts, threats to leap down. Harmonias gifts sad Eriphyle doth shun. No less unhappy in her spouse then Son. All the Minpian tales of aery Creet Here as in several pictures waving meet. A white Bulls steps Pasiphae doth pursue. Scorn'd Ariadne bears her winded clew. Her cast by tablets Phædra turns to see. A rope this holds, a specious Cor'net shee. Another is asham'd she ere did bow Beneath the Cavernes oth' Dedalian Cow. Snatch'd from her living and dead spouse, two nights Laodamia wailes, mock'd with delights. On th'other side with naked swords severe Thysbe, and Canace, and Eliza were: She husbands, Sires this that her guest's sword bore. And the horn'd Moon her self roves (as before? Pleas'd with Endimions slumbers, up and down 'Mongst Latmian rocks) w?? Torch, &amp; starry crown. A hundred more who their old loves review, With sad, yet sweet complaints, their pains renew. In midst of whom, by the black shade benighted, With whizzing wings Love unawares alighted; All knew the Boy; and recollecting, thought him Common offendour; though damp clouds about him Obscure his belt, with golden buckles bright, His Quiver, and his radiant Torches light, Yet do they know him; and begin to show Vain rage upon the lonely wandering Foe; Whom as slow flight in the thick night he takes Crowding together they oppresse; he quakes, And vainly striving to escape, along They drew him in the midst of all the throng. The most known Myrtle ith' sad Groves elected; Por pain'd Gods hated; Proserpine neglected There long before Adonis crucified For loving Venus; Love his hands being tied Behinde him, his feet bound, on this high tree Suspended with excessive cruelty They torture; who to sentence must submit Unjudg'd and guiltless; All themselves acquit, Glad their own faults on others to transfer: Upbraiding, All their instruments prepare Of death: these armes, this vengeance sweet esteem, To punish by that means which murdered them. One brings a rope; she an illusive sword; Another ragged cliffes, a hollow ford, Dread of mad floods, Seas where no waves appear. Flames others shake, threatning his trembling fear, With hizzing firelesse Torches; Myrrha parts Her tender womb with lucid tears, and darts The gummy Jewels of her weeping tree. Others lesse cruel will that all might be Only in sport, to raise by some sharp thorn That tender blood, whereof the Rose was born, Or neer him hold the Torches sportive flame When Venus, his blest Mother, in the same Crime's faulty, through the crowd doth safely press, Not her enclos'd sons suffrings to redress, But his fear doubling, furies doth inflame With bitter stings, transferring her own shame Upon her son; because with Mars surpriz'd By the blinde nets her Husband had devis'd; Because the Hellespontiack power they slight; Eryx unkind, half Man Hermaphrodite; Words not suffice, but with a wreath of Roses She whips the crying Boy, whom fear disposes For worse; from his chaff'd limbs a purple dew With many stripes the twisted Roses drew, From which a tincture they receiv'd more bright. The sharp threats fall; revenge to Venus might Transmit the guilt, should it the crime exceed; The Heroines themselves thus for him plead; Willing, their funerals and hapless state Rather to attribute to cruel Fate. The pious Mother gives them thanks; they quit Their griefs, and freely the Boys faults remit. Nocturnal fancies in such shapes exprest, Long with vain fear disturb'd my tim'rous rest: Till dark sleep chac'd, thence suff'ring Cupid flies, Through th'Ivory gate escaping to the skies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VENUS VIGILS. Love he to morrow, who lov'd never; To morrow, who hath lov'd, persever. The Spring appears, in which the Earth Receives a new harmonious Birth; When all things mutual Love unites; When Birds perform their nuptial rites; And fruitful by her watry Lover, Each grove its tresses doth recover; Loves Queen to morrow, in the shade Which by these verdant trees is made, Their sprouting tops in wreaths shall bind, And Myrtles into Arbours wind; To morrow rais'd on a high throne, Dione shall her Laws make known. Love he, &amp;c. Then the round Oceans foaming flood, Immingled with Celestial blood, 'Mongst the blew People of the Main, And Horses whom two feet sustain, Rising Dione did beget, With fruitful waters dropping wet. Love he, &amp;c. With flowry Jewels every where She paints the purple colour'd year; She, when the rising bud receives Favonious breath, thrusts forth the leaves, The naked Roof with these t'adorn; She the transparent dew oth' morn, Which the thick Air of night still uses To leave behind, in Rain diffuses; These tears with Orient brightnesse shine, Whilst they with trembling weight decline, Whose every drop, into a small Clear Orbe distill'd, sustains its fall. Pregnant with these the bashful Rose Her purple blushes doth disclose. The drops of falling dew, that are Shed in calm nights by every Star, She in her humid mantle holds, And then her Virgin leaves unfolds. Ith' morn by her command, each maid With dewy Roses is arraid; Which from Cytheras crimson blood, From the soft kisses love bestow'd, From Jewels, from the radiant flame, And the Suns purple lustre came. She to her spouse shall married be To morrow; not asham'd, that he Should with a single knot unty, Her fiery garment's purple dy. Love he, &amp;c. The Goddesse bade the Nymphs remove Unto the shady Myrtle grove; The boy goes with the maids, yet none Will trust, or think love tame is grown, If they perceive that any where He Arrows doth about him bear. Go fearlesse Nymphs, for love hath laid Aside his Armes, and tame is made. His weapons by command resign'd, Naked to go he is enjoyn'd: Lest he hurt any by his craft, Either with flame, or bow, or shaft. But yet take heed young Nymphs, beware You trust him not, for Cupid's fair, Lest by his beauty you be harm'd; Love naked is compleatly arm'd. Love he, &amp;c. Fair Venus Virgins sends to thee, Indu'd with equal modesty; One onely thing we thee desire, Chast Delia for a while retire; That the wide Forest, that the Wood May be unstain'd with savage blood; She would with prayers her self attend thee, But that she knew she could not bend thee; She would thy self to come have praid, Did these delights beseem a Maid; Now mightst thou see with hallowed rites, The Chorus solemnize three nights; Mongst Troops whom equal pleasure crowns, To play and sport upon thy downs; 'Mongst Garlands made of various flowers, 'Mongst ever verdant Myrtle bowers; Ceres nor Bacchus absent be, Nor yet the Poets Deitie: All night we wholly must employ In Vigils, and in Songs of joy; None but Diana must bear sway Amongst the Woods, Delia gives way. Love he, &amp;c. She, the Tribunal did command Deckt with Dyblæan flowers should stand; She will in judgement sit; the Graces On either side shall have their places; Hybla thy flowers powre forth, what ere Was brought thee by the welcome year; Hybla thy flowry garment spread, Wide as is Enna's fruitful mead; Maids of the Countrey here will be; Maids of the Mountains come to see; Hither resort, all such as dwell Either in Grove, or Wood, or Well; The wing'd boyes Mother, every one Commands in order to sit down; Charging the Virgins, that they must In nothing Love, though naked, trust. Love he, &amp;c. Let the fresh covert of a shade Be by these early flowers displai'd; To morrow, (which with sports and play We keep) was Æthers Wedding day; When first the Father of the Spring Did out of clouds the young year bring; The husband shower then courts his spouse, And in her sacred bosome flowes, That all which that vast body bred, By this defluxion may be fed: Produc'd within She all there swayes, By a hid spirit, which by-wayes Unknown diffus'd, through soul and vains, All things both governs and sustains. Piercing through the unsounded Sea, And Earth, and highest Heaven, She All places with her power doth fill, Which through each part She doth distill; And to the World, the mystick wayes Of all production open layes. Love he, &amp;c. She to the Latines did transfer The Trojan Nephews; and by her Was the Laurentian Virgin won, And joyn'd in marriage to her son; By her assistance did Mars gain A votaresse from Vesta's fane; To marriage Romulus betraid The Sabine Women, by her aid; (Of Romans the wide-spreading stem:) And in the long descent of them In whom that off-spring was dilated, Cæsar her Nephew she created. Love he, &amp;c. The fields are fruitful made by pleasure; The fields are rich in Venus treasure; And love Diones son fame yields For truth, his birth had in the fields: As soon as born the field reliev'd him; Into its bosom first receiv'd him; She bred him from his infant howers With the sweet kisses of the flowers. Love he, &amp;c. See how the Bulls their sides distend, And broomstalks with the burthen bend; Now every one doth safely ly, Confin'd within his marriage ty; See, with their husbands here are laid The bleating flocks, beneath the shade; The warbling Birds on every tree, The Goddess wills not silent be. The vocal Swans on every lake With their hoarse voice a harsh sound make; And Tereus hapless Maid, beneath The Poplars shade her Song doth breath; Such as might well perswade thee, Love Doth in these trembling accents move; Not that the sister in those strains Of the inhumane spouse complains: We silent are whilst she doth sing; How long in coming is my Spring? When will the time arrive, that I May Swallow-like my voice unty? My Muse for being silent flies me, And Phœbus will no longer prize me: So did Amiclæ once, whilst all Silence observ'd, through silence fall. Love he to morrow, who lov'd never; To morrow who hath lov'd, persever.</field>

Here's Musick, Wine, Cups, and an Arbour made Of cooling flags, that cast a grateful shade: A Pipe whereon a Shepherd sweetly playes, Whilst the Mænalian Cave resounds his layes: A Hogshead of brisk wine new pierc'd: a Spring Of pleasant Water ever murmuring: Wreaths twisted with the purple Violet; White Garlands with the blushing Rose beset; And Osier Baskets with fair Lillies fraught From the Bank-side by Achelois brought: Fresh Cheese in Rushy Cradles layd to dry: Soft Plums, by Autumn ripend leisurely: Chessenuts, and A ples sweetly streakt with red; Neat Ceres by young Love and Bacchus led: Black Mulberries, an overcharged Vine; Green Cowcumbers, that on their stalks decline: The Gardens Guardian, with no dreadful look, Nor other weapon then a pruning-book. Tabor and Pipe come hither: see, alasse. Thy tir'd Beast sweats; spare him; our wel-lov'd Asse. The Grassehopper chirps on her green seat, The Lizard peeps out of his cold retreat; Come, in this shade thy weary Limbs repose, And crown thy drowsie Temples with the Rose. A Maids Lip safely maist thou rifle here; Away with such whose Foreheads are severe. Flowers why reservst thou for unthankful Dust? To thy cold Tomb wilt Thou these Garlands trust? Bring Wine and Dice; hang them the morrow weigh: Death warns, I come (saith he) live while you may. The Debauche. Let's not rime the hours away; Friends! We must no longer play: Brisk Lyæus (see!) invites To more ravishing delights. Let's give o're this Fool Apollo; Nor his Fiddle longer follow: Fye upon his forked Hill, With his Fiddlestick and Quill; And the Muses, though they're gamesome, They are neither young nor handsome; And their Freaks in sober sadnesse Are a meer Poetick Madnesse: Pegasus is but a Horse, He that follows him is worse. See the Rain soaks to the skin, Make it rain as well within. Wine my Boy; Wee'l sing and laugh, All night revel, rant, and quaffe; Till the Morn stealing behind us At the Table sleeplesse finde us. When our Bones (alasse) shall have A cold lodging in the Grave, When swift Death shall overtake us, We shall sleep and none can wake us. Drink we then the juice o'th' Vine, Make our breasts Lyæus Shrine; Bacchus, our debauche beholding, By thy Image I am moulding, Whilst my Brains I do replenish With this draught of unmixt Rhenish; By thy full-branch'd Ivy Twine; By this sparkling Glasse of Wine; By thy Thyrsus so renown'd; By the Healths with which th'art crown'd; By the Feasts which thou do'st prize; By thy numerous Victories; By the Howls by Mænad's made; By this Hau-gou Carbonade; By thy colours, red and white; By the Tavern thy delight; By the sound thy Orgies spred; By the shine of Noses red; By thy Table free for all; By the jovial Carnivall; By thy language Cabalistick; By thy Cymbal, Drum and his stick; By the Tunes thy Quart-pots strike up; By thy Sighes, the broaken Hick-up; By thy mystick Sect of Ranters; By thy never-tamed Panthers; By this sweet, this fresh and free air; By thy Goat, as chaste as We are; By thy fulsome Cretan Lasse; By the Old Man on the Asse; By thy Couzins in mix'd shapes; By the flowre of fairest Grapes; By thy Biskes fam'd far and wide; By thy store of Neats-tongues dry'd; By thy Incense, Indian smoake; By the Joyes thou dost provoke; By this salt Westphalia Gammon; By these Sauz'iges that inflame one; By thy tall Majestick Flaggons; By Mas, Tope, and thy Flap-dragons; By this Olive's unctuous savour; By this Ownge, the Wines flavour; By this Cheese orerun with Mites; By thy dearest Favorites; To thy frolick Order call us, Knights of the deep Bowle install us; And to shew thy self divine, Never let it want for Wine. Aristenætus to Philocalus. Nature with beauty Lais did invest, But Venus crown'd with sweetness 'bove the rest, And registred her sacred name in Heaven To make the number of the Graces even By golden Love instructed, Mortal Hearts To wound with her bright Eyes unerring darts Her Sexes Wonder, Natures Masterpiece And living Image she of Venus is. Her cheeks a mixed red and white disclose, That emulates the splendour of the Rose: Yet these the tincture of her Lip out-vies Pure black her even-arched eye brows dies Beneath whose Sable Hemispheres the bright Suns of her Eyes, move with full Orbs of Light. The black and white here kindly disagree Grac'd by each others Contrariety: In these the Graces are enthron'd, and there By all that see ador'd: her curious Hair In which the Jacynths colour is exprest By hands of Nature curld, of Venus drest. Her neck by a rich Carquanet embrac'd With the fair letters of her name enchac'd: Her Garment to her shape though loose, so fit, As if not made for her, but she for it. Beautious in the becoming Dresse she wears, But Beauties self, she, when that's off, appears. And when she moves this curious frame her Gate Expresseth quicknesse intermixt with state. Such motion in tall Cypresses we finde, Or Palms when breath'd on by some gentle winde; Yet with this difference; them Zephyr moves, But she is wafted on the breath of Loves. Her his Original the Painter makes, When or the Graces or their Queen he takes. Her Breasts in envy of each other swell, And their kinde silken Bands coyly repel: But when she speaks; what clouds of Syrens watch About her Lips, and her soft accents snatch: The Cæstus she of Cytheræa wears, A matchlesse form which no exception bears. How fell this Mistresse (Venus) to my share? Was I the Judge that sentenc'd thee most fair? Thou not from me didst the rich Ball receive, Yet to me freely dost this Hellen give. To thy kinde power what offring shall I pay? Her all that see, that none may envy, pray. She darts so glorious, yet so mild a Light, As dazels not, but cleers the Gazers sight. Old men beholding her accuse their Fate, Wish hers had earlier been, or theirs more late. The Power that angry Nature did deny The dumb, by signes they in her praise supply: None knows who sums in her all Beauties store, Or what to say or how she should give o're. Gold. Thou much lov'd cause of all the toyles That wait on life, Mettle whose yellow splendour smiles Worlds into strife, More sharp more deadly, of lesse worth Then is the steel that digs thee forth. Fool that he was who took the pains To loose thy bands Sifting the Earths discolour'd vains, The Waters sands, And freed thee from thy prison, where Confin'd by pious Natures care. A swarm of Furies came along From Hell with thee, Deceit, Ambition, Envy, Wrong, Hate, Crueltie, And that unsatiable thirst Which where most cherish'd rageth worst. For thee the Oceans ancient peace. The first ship broke, And on the Empire of the Seas Impos'd a yoke; Boreas with pride the Pine beheld That scorn'd his breath to court it fell'd. Churlish dissentions flattring Sire Who love untiest, Distracted Kingdoms sets on fire, And concord flyest, The Plunderer thou mak'st thy prey The thief steal'st from himself away. With Gold love heads the surest Dart His Quiver bears; Which in the coldest womans heart, Impression wears: Their flinty bosomes never dread, The arrow that is tipt with lead. You richest treasures Nature owns Can you refuse, The noblest of affections The meanest choose. Why seek you gems and gold? there are Gems in your eyes, gold in your hair. Worth it derives from our esteem, Thought onely bright By darkned judgements, yet though dim, Dazles our sight, More then the Planet of the day, To whom he owes his sickly ray. Happy those men who free from want, The earth possest, Of wealth yet wisely ignorant, As that of Rest: They Poverty their Treasure priz'd; And Gold the golden age despis'd. He that to Heaven would take his way, Ere he begin, Must down this glitt'ring burthen lay, This bait of sin, Or its oppressive earthly weight Will clog his wings, and check his flight. Adonis. Ah poor Adonis all my Cupids be Thy Mourners, all my joyes are dead with thee. Had but thy councel o're thy will prevail'd, Nor thee thy life, nor me thy love had fail'd. The Rose forsakes thy lip, the sweets are fled Breath'd in thy kisses, yet I'le kisse thee dead: Kisse and rekisse thee but thou neither art, Of kisses sensible, nor of my smart. Ah poor Adonis, all my Cupids be Thy mourners, all my joyes are dead with thee. The Woods in sighs, Rivers in tears lament, Echo in groanes her griefs and mine doth vent. In purple every drooping flower is drest, And mourning garments every field invest. Ah poor Adonis, all my Cupids be Thy Mourners, all my joyes are dead with thee. You his lov'd Hounds obsequious to his call, Couch'd at his feet, lament your Masters fall; Take your eternal leave; Then, swift as Fame Fly to the Woods, and there his death proclaim. Ah poor Adonis, all my Cupids be Thy Mourners, all my joyes are dead with thee. You milk-white Doves, which to Jove starry Court, Through fleeting clouds my Chariot did transport, Go mount the Heavens, and to the Gods make known, That all my joyes like faithlesse dreams are flown. Ah poor Adonis all my Cupids be Thy Mournrners, all my joyes are dead with thee. You silver Swans now from your harnesse free, Fly 'bout the painted mead at liberty; And to the flowers recount, Venus hath shed As many tears as drops Adonis bled. Ah poor Adonis, all my Cupids be Thy Mourners, all my joyes are dead with thee. And you my sister Graces go and tell To savage Rocks, where Beasts more savage dwell; Cold in her lap Cythera's Lover lyes, And Death (like slumber) dwels upon his eyes. Ah poor Adonis, all my Cupids be Thy Mourners, all my joyes are dead with thee. My sons, on his pale corps your tresses strew, Let each his Torch extinguish'd, Quiver, Bow, And broken Arrows bring then, with sad cries Surrounding me, perform his Obsequies. His eyes, one with his rosy fingers close, The other, on his arm his head repose: This fan the winde upon him with his wing, To bath him, that fetch water from the spring. Ah poor Adonis all my Cupids be Thy Mourners, all my joyes are dead with thee. Dear Love, e're thou descend into the deep, Shake from thy eyes, a while, this mortal sleep; Look up a little; hear me but relate, The dismal story of my haplesse fate: Then in a kisse breath out thy soul in mine, Whilst I my trembling lips impose on thine; And drink Loves latest draught, which through each part, Like divine Nectar, gliding to my heart, Shall there for ever dwell instead of thee Who Minion now to Proserpine must be. This said, her bodie gently she inclines, And weeping to his lips her lips she joyns; To catch the Reliques of his soul not flown, And kindly gives them burial in her own. [Along the mead Europa walks] Along the mead Europa walks To choose the fairest of its gems, Which plucking from their slender stalks, She weaves in fragrant diadems. Where ere the beautious virgin treads, The common people of the field, To kisse her feet bowing their heads, Homage as to their Goddesse yield. Twixt whom ambitious wars arise, which to the Qeen shall first present A gift Arabian spice outvies, The votive offring of their scent. When deathlesse Amaranth this strife, Greedy by dying to decide, Begs she would her green thread of life, As loves fair destiny divide. Pliant Acanthus now the Vine, And Ivy enviously beholds, Wishing her odorous arms might twine About this Fair in such strict folds. The Violet by her foot opprest, Doth from that touch enamour'd rise, But loosing strait what made her blest, Hangs down her head, looks pale, and dies. Clitia to new devotion won, doth now her former faith deny, Sees in her face a double Sun, And glories in Apostasy. The Gilliflower which mocks the skies, (The meadows painted Rainbow) seeks A brighter lustre from her eyes, And richer scarlet from her cheeks. The jocund flower de Luce appears, Because neglected, discontent; The Morning furnish'd her with tears, Her sighs expiring odours vent. Narcissus in her eyes once more, Seems his own beauty to admire; In water not so clear before, As represented now in fire. The Crocus who would gladly claim A priviledge above the rest, Begs with his triple tongue of flame, To be transplanted to her breast. The Hyacinth in whose pale leaves The hand of Nature writ his fate, With a glad smile his sigh deceives In hopes to be more fortunate. His head the drowsie Poppy rais'd, Awak'd by this approaching morn, And view'd her purple light amaz'd, Though his (alasse) was but her scorn. None of this aromatick croud, But for their kinde death humbly call, Courting her hand, like Martyrs proud, By so divine a fate to fall. The Royal Maid th'applause disdains Of vulgar flowers, and onely chose The bashful glory of the plains Sweet daughter of the Spring, the Rose. She like her self a Queen appears, Rais'd on a verdant thorny throne, Guarded by amorous winds, and wears A purple Robe, a golden crown. [Venus whose fair Deity] Venus whose fair Deity Cnidus doth and Cyprus sway, Round about the Cupids fly, And the wanton Graces play. Thee our pious Mother Earth, Life, and love of plants desires, Trees receive, and give new birth, Warm'd with thy enlivening fires. Thee the thirsty furrows call, When in drops of welcome rain, Gems from thy rich bosome fall, And adorn the glittring plain. On the Heliconian Hill, And Olympus simples grow, Fed by thee, to which their skill Chiron, and wise Circe owe. In a blush the Rose her shame Doth for wounding thee discover, Yet, to sooth thy amorous flame Wears the picture of thy Lover. Over all, thy power presides; What the foodful Earth maintains, What through air or water glides, Or the dark Abisse restrains. Thee the nights black Regent knew, When ore Ætna his fair prize, Swift Tartarian Horses drew, Shook the Earth, ore-cast the Skies. On the liquid Marble Plain, Thy sharp darts impression make, Not the waters of the Main, Could the fires of Neptune slake. Gods Celestial Thee have felt Slily proving strange escapes, Jove himself thy flame did melt Into misbeseeming shapes. The kinde heat thy Torch inspires In young virgins, no art smothers: Not thy self is from those fires Free, with which thou scorchest others. Some remains of Mars's love, Yet in thy warm breast are left, May he ever constant prove, Nor the Sun betray your theft. Men and Maids thy Name invoke, That, in thy strict fetters bound, They may joyntly bear thy yoke, Be with numerous issue crown'd. Flowers and Mirtles see we bring, With our gifts thy Altars blaze, Boyes imposing incense, sing, Virgins answer in thy praise. Erycine appear, appear, Thy bright star no longer hide, Come enjoy thy pleasures here, Freely as on wondring Ide.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SYLVIA'S PARK, by Theophile. ACANTHUS COMPLAINT, by Tristan. ORONTA, by Preti. ECHO, by Marino. LOVES EMBASSY, by Boscan. THE SOLITVDE. by Gongora. SYLVIA'S PARK. Apollo (Poets say) his Beam On all that court his Name bestows; And knowledg in his vales smooth stream, Into their quickned Spirits flows; But our chaste Muse is unbeguil'd, Phœbus eternally exil'd From her sublimer Poesy; Those Temples now are overthrown, And all the Dæmons they did own In their dumb ruines buried ly. Those dark Impostors shall no more Intrap us in their dangerous snares; A Power Celestial We implore, Enthron'd above the highest Starres: From this Divinity alone (The Bound of all Devotion) Have I receiv'd a hallowed flame, Which learns my humble Soul to rise, And bids her aim at such a Prize, As may inherit deathlesse Fame. Then we an Image so divine Of his bright Glories will reherse, That Heav'n it self shall gladly joyn, To justifie our sacred Verse. For next the Altar, at whose fire Falls prostrate the Seraphick Quire, And Eccho their harmonious Layes, We with a thought as innocent, To a chaste Beauty may present The fragrant Incense of our Praise. Thus Sylvia from the just presage Of my unspotted vows, shall claim That lasting sound, which every Age To come, a second Life will name, But if cross Fate my verse cast down, Ecclipsing by some Potent frown The sacred Reliques of her Glory, These Waters, every Rock, and Grove, Assuming Soul, and Speech, will prove Faithful Recorders of her Story. If Trees that were of old renown'd By impious Adoration, took New spirit, and articulate sound, From weak Diana's sickly look; If Rivers, as along they glide, Spoke in the Murmurs of their Tide, What Fauns, or Fairies did inspire; If Stubborn Rocks and senseless Stones, Could melt with Pitty, and in Grones Keep Time with Orpheus charming Lyre. What stranger hardness must possess The object by my Princess grac'd, If quickned by that happiness, To voice its Joyes it do not haste? Through this proud structures daz'ling Hight, Through this sweet Walks secure delight, What Marble can so solid be, But is transparent to her Eye? What Trees and Fountains stealing by, But own her for a Deity? Those Oaks that most obdurate are, Shall willingly their arms unwind; And by themselves ungraven wear My verse upon their Leaves, and Rind: And every Tree, whose Top prefers To Heaven these sacred Characters, No storms shall offer to invade. For whilst thus charm'd, the rough Winds may Hope with more ease, to snatch away Their fastned Roots, or fleeting shade. These floating Mirrours, on whose Brow Their various figures gently glide, For love of her shall gently grow, In faithful Icy fetters ty'd. This cheerful Brooks unwrinkled face, Shall smile within its Christal case, To see it self made permanent, And from Times rage secur'd, the deep Impression of my Cyphers keep, And my fair Princess form present. But her unequal Praise requires More Pens then ours to set her forth: Behold how Heaven it self conspires O're all the World to paint her forth! In the bright Sun her eyes are drawn; In the fresh Beauties of the Dawn, Those of her blushing cheek appear: No Power her Vertues can deface, Until the Heavens forsake their place, And darkned Stars drop from their sphear. One evening, when the Azure Main Its softer Litter did prepare For the bright Steeds which draw the Wain Of weary Day's declining Star, By chance the Bed I did survey Whereon a sleeping Naïad lay, And Sylvia angling in the Brook: There I beheld the Fishes strife, Which first should sacrifice its life, To be the Trophey of her Hook. Whilst with one hand the Line she cast, Commanding Silence with the other, Her signe the Day obeying, past More slily by her dusky Brother. The doubtful Sun with equal awe, Fear'd to approach or to withdraw: The intentive Stars suspend their glowing. No Rage the quiet Billows swell'd, Favonius his soft breath withheld, The listning Grass refrain'd from growing. Her sparkling Eyes, a subtle fire Through the undreaded streams transmit: Whose radiant flame the waves admire, Not daring to extinguish it. These warring Elements (their wild Dissention gladly reconcil'd) Submit to her imperious Eye: Her anger fearing to excite, Lay down their own, forgetting quite Their old inherent Enmity. Soon as the Tritons her bright face Did through their fluid windows view, The flaming object did displace Their humid forms, to give them new, Whilst, with amazement extaside, About them creeps a Stags rough hide, And their devested figure vails: Now wondring whence their young horns sprout, Or how their rugged coat buds out, Through the smooth hardness of their scales. Griev'd at this Fate unkindly strange, Which fixing branches on their brows, These Deities to Beasts doth change, And down their bashful foreheads bows; The treacherous water they forsake, And to the Land themselves betake, Where trees their gloomy lodging shade, There walk with discontented look, Their shadow onely to that Brook Now trusting, which themselves betray'd. The Suns bright sister, Poets say, Nature with newer power enclosed; And in this figure did array Acteon, his old shape depos'd. The same inglorious punishment Which to a Man, a Goddess sent, For his profanely curious sight, The Gods themselves have suffer'd here; Who with bold eyes ventur'd too near Our chaste Dianas greater light. These dear pursued by fear, and shame, Which from the walks and alleys drive them, Their own deceitful fortunes blame, That of their wonted cold deprive them. Their hearts are now of moisture drain'd, Nor but with timerousness restrain'd, Look they to Heaven, or on Earth tread: For oft as Sylvia passeth by, She lightning darts from her black eye, Threatning the war which still they dread. Yet happy, and o'rejoyd are they, To breath the air which she respires; Living subjected to her sway, Fate now exceeds their proud desires, The Princess, when she did devest Their ancient forms, of new possest, A snowy whiteness made them bear: Kindly bestowing on their grief, The priviledge of this relief, They alwayes should her livery wear. Here a close Valley Trees protect, With twisted branches overlai'd: To which the Sun bears much respect, He never violates their shade. To wait on whom, on either side, Two purling Rivers gently glide. A lazy Lake sleeps at his feet, Rous'd from his sluggish dreams by these Self-chasing sister-Naïades, Who kindly in his Bosom meet. A thousand little Cupids here, Aside their Bows and Quivers laid, When Night is by their eyes made cleer, Into the glittering Water wade. Hither the Nerëids resort, To bath their purer Limbs, to sport, And with the Loves raise harmless wars, Diana from her silver Wain Descending, leave her drowsie Swain, To swim amongst these naked Stars. Ith midst is plac'd a little Isle, Crownd by an Arbours shady Crest, Where Spring eternal seems to smile, With flowers by careful Nature drest. Hither each morn, and night, repair The featherd Choristers oth'air, To give their various passions vent: The Nightingale above the rest, Her joyes in this soft language drest, Doth to fair Sylvias ear present. I, who so oft the Eastern Bowers Visit, my sacred Hymns to sing; And view the spicy sweets, the Flowers, With all the rich Embellishing Of Gold, Pearls, Rubies, which the Morn Takes her fair Tresses to adorn; And that bright flame with which she dies (Stoln from the Sun) her pale Cheeks, When she to seem most lovely seeks In her deer Cephalus his Eyes. Daily the Woods fair Queen I see With nimble feet the Thickets trace, Who, list'ning to my Harmony, Stands often still, and leaves the Chace. But I the Heavens, and Gods attest, By whom with Life and Musick blest; Thy Eyes, in their least glance, disclose More Beauties, a diviner fire, And in my Song more Life inspire, Then all the Grace that either owes. Enough, enough, sweet Philomel! We now this happy Park must leave; In every part such Beauties dwell, As our too bold attempt deceive. Each drop that from these Fountains flows, Each Flower that in these Gardens grows, The fruit on every Tree or Wall, Are the just subject of all praise: What then must be the glorious raies, Of Sylvias Eyes, that guild them all. Acanthus Complaint. VVhen cheerful Spring smil'd on the Flowers, Acanthus, hapless youth, essay'd By tears, to bend th'ungentle powers: Still waters which his flame betray'd. So void of sence, as if the stone In which he lay, and he, were one. When by those briny streams, his eyes Had given his heart a little vent, He then his sickly voice unties, His deep misfortunes to lament: And thinking none else heard his plaints, To Heav'n and Earth his grief thus paints. Sun, wheresoe're thou dost dispence To wondring Mortals, life, and light; Hast thou found any influence, But Sylvia's, then thy own more bright. In all thy course didst thou e're see One fair like Her, one crost like Me: Ere since I serv'd her first, Heav'n knows! I duly offer'd sighs and tears: But she, alas! contemns my woes, The bondage of so many years: Nor will (unkinde!) vouchsafe to turn Her eyes though but to see my urn. Ah cruel, whose relentless minde vainly my piteous cries invade; By service proud, by Love unkinde, And by my sorrows scornful made; Not that thou pity, onely view Him, whom thou doom'st to death, I sue. The stock I own, not makes me less Clouded with meanness, or disgrace; For, without boast, I may profess The glory of a spotless race: My Father in his tender age, Withstood the Bear, and Lions rage. A cloud of ravenous beasts once fell Upon our fold, to lay it wast; When he the tempest did dispel With his victorious arm, at last Fighting to set Pans altars free, By death gain'd Immortality. And in his forward steps I tread; Where Honour me his Image cals: No face of danger do I dread, Death in no shape my soul appals: I never yet met Enemy, But I could master, except Thee. The other day, in yonder den Which with my woes doth oft resound, Seeking a Lamb strai'd from our Pen, A litter of Tigers I found, The Dam that chac'd me did I slay, And the young Orphans brought away. One that's left, for Thee I keep: Whose courage sparkles in his eye: And though scarce old enough to creep, From none will suffer injury; Yet will to me his Master bow: Nor half so savage is as Thou. Yet courage heightned by success Thou mightst account an empty boast, If the deep skill which I profess, Had with my liberty been lost. The power of simples I reveal, And all pains but my own, can heal. Thousands of Lovers can I show That change Loves laws for those of Flora, Which in my painted Garden grow, Washt with the tears of fair Aurora; Oh might I live in that disguise, So I were water'd by thy eyes! There yellow Clitia shalt thou finde Retaining still her jealous look; And that stout Greek, whose warlike mind An unjust sentence could not brook: Adonis, Narcissus full blown, That Venus Martyr, this his own. And as the vertues that they hide, Their stories too I can disclose; How Juno's Milk the Lilly died, And Cytherea's Blood the Rose; Whose full buds swell with humble pride, To be by thy fair Cheek outvi'd. Thousands of trees thou shalt see there, With grateful Earths ripe presents fraught, And on the ruggid coats they wear, Have I thy Name and Motto wrought: The luscious Plum, the purple Berry, Guilt Apricock, and juicy Cherry. There Jesmine Groves will thee invite, Though the Suns entrance they refuse: In which sweet lab'rinth of delight, Thou willingly thy self shalt lose, As in thy hairs more od'rous maze, My ravish'd soul entangled strayes. But foolishly I glory in My Trees, though they of fruit be full: Or by my flocks esteem would win, Though they abound in Milk and Wool. How can I call these riches mine, When ev'n my self, alass! am thine? When the bright Regent of the day Begins to guild the smiling East, Or in his saffron night-array Hastens in Thetis lap to rest; My early griefs rise with the light, Encreasing with the shades of Night. For when the black Queen, crown'd with Stars, The Suns retiring beams supplies, Though slumber all the sharpest cares Of others, in soft fetters ties; Yet I perpetual vigils keep, Shun'd equally by Death, and Sleep. The onely comfort I'm allow'd Is in thy Picture, taken late By one of whom the Art is proud, Judge then how hapless is my state, Who for the wound the substance made Must of the shadow seek for aid. The other day, this sacred Charm; With dew devotion I drew forth; My soul 'gainst ill advice to arm, And vindicate thy sacred worth: Mirtillo's Mother, pitying me, Inveigh'd against thy cruelty. She told me that my humble smart Had rais'd thy pride to this excess; And that thy unrelenting heart Would own more flame, if mine had lesse; Coy Lovers, coyness best defeat, Who win most ground when they retreat. And if no Art could win thy love, She counsel'd me to seek another: Some lesse ungentle fair to prove, And in a new, my old flame smother. That other Beauties I might finde, If not so fair, yet far more kinde. Cloris, said I, it is too true, A cruel passion I maintain: And time its vigour doth renew, Feeding my grief, and her disdain: Yet so affect what I endure, Death I would chuse, before the Cure. So much I doat upon my chains, And the dear prison I am in; That my own hand the wall maintains, Lest Reason should admittance win. Nor could she with more pride confine, Then I my freedom did resigne. To my last breath I shun release, More with her cruelty contented; Nor shall my zealous faith decrease, To see my martyrdom augmented. The best of Joyes, we should not buy But with the worst of misery. Acanthus, breathing forth these woes, Heard something rustle in the bush, And hastily (surpriz'd) arose, His bashful cheek stain'd with a blush: For Daphnis unawares appear'd, Who all his passion overheard. ORONTA, The Cyprian Virgin. When glorious Cyprus (long in vain pursu'd) Often victorious was at last subdu'd; (Nor had the heat of fire and anger ceast, Had they not been by streams of blood supprest) When every one the Thracian rage did feel, And those with I'rn were bound that scap'd the steel; When Limbs and ruin'd Walls in heaps were laid, And Loves soft kingdom Mars's field was made. Victorious Mustapha is angry still, Because no more are left to oppose his will, The field he keeps, with squadrons yet o're-spread, And threatens death once more against the dead. His horrid foot-steps he imprints in blood, Yet seeks for more t'increase the purple flood; And seems adverse fortune vext, to see So many that by death from death were free. The Spoiler, all be-smear'd with dropping gore, Ransacks the levell'd ruines (walls no more;) Removes the stones and beams, climbs where they stood, As greedy now of gold as late of blood: The lowest he casts up, the high down throws, Deaf to the Prayers, blind to th'wounds of foes; Whilst the demolish'd walls become a grave, Th'unburied carkasses a burial have. There was a stately Temple, to which led By fear, for refuge many Christians fled; The foe arrives, and fight not but destroyes, For these their throats, and he his sword employes; Flames seising on the roof o're-throw the Walls, The Fabrick once near Heaven, to Earth now falls, The murderer doth not the slain survive, And he that kill'd dyes buried alive. Now none are left his anger to asswage, The vanquish'd General feels the Victors rage, His honour'd head he fixing on a Spear, A barbarous trophy of his death doth rear: Upon the headless body he doth tread, Insulting with new fury on the dead. Then round about he roves, and every where Lightning in's eye, Thunder in's sword doth bear. So when Megæra terrible to sight, Her bloody whip now waves, then holds upright, When Squadrons mixt in fight Squadrons ore-turn, And every where the angry Steel doth burn: She who her glory 'mongst the dead acquires, Their arms with strength, their souls with rage inspires, And as she doth her snaky tresses spread, The fields with bones look white, with blood look red. Each place resounds with the triumphant cry, Mountains and Vallies eccho Victory; The hollow Cannons with a sportive blaze And horrid sound, thunder and lightning raise; The Horses neighing, and the Men with cries, Seem rather greedy of the War then prize, And the shrill trumpets dreadful harmony Alarms doth rather sound then victory. Night rising from the Orient now invades Each soul with rest, and every field with shades; The festive fires shine clear, whose burning pride Doth the black thickness of the mist divide: The flames directly here, there curling rise, Hizzing and rending darkness to the skies: And whilst the sparks with trembling lights ascend, Earth seems new stars unto the Heavens to lend. Forth her nocturnal dwelling in the East Aurora with a crown of light comes drest, In a Pyropus Chariot she doth rise, And silvers over first, then gilds the skies, Loves brigher star, the Harbinger of day, Her splendour stain'd with pale grief doth display, To see th'oppression that her kingdom bears, She drops from Heaven her dew distill'd in tears. Now the hoarse Trumpet's early ecco all Unto their work, ships to the shore doth call; For ere the newes of victory attains That mighty Monarch in Byzantium raigns, A surer message Mustapha intends, And of the Cyprian spoyles a present sends, Desirous that his winged Navy might Even feather'd Fame out-strip by speedier flight. Unto the Sea they hasten with the best Of Jewels, Gold, and Scarlets weight opprest; With a rich burden are the vessels fraught Of proud Materials curiously wrought; The stout Keels pant, and the retyring Main Bowes underneath the Treasure they sustain: Yet Ships and Waters both seem proud to bear Kingdoms contracted in that narrow sphear. Virgins and Youths to sea are driven thence, And Beauty pris'ner led with Innocence: Who their soft limbs with cruel chains doth bind, They with their eyes fetter his captive mind, Victors and vanquisht thus together force One for the others grief to feel remorse. Thus Mars and Love their double Palms obtain, Which this o're bodies, that o're souls doth gain. The Pilot the tenacious ancour tore (With crooked teeth) up from the sandy shore: Of Eastern breath a gentle flattering gale, Calms the smooth Sea, and swels the pregnant sail. Their Oares the water break, the air their cries, The Haven backward goes, the Navy flies; The furrows break in silver foam; none know Whither the Ship or Wind doth faster go. Along the shore the wretched Mothers stray, Their cheeks they tear, dishevel'd hairs display: The lancing ships beholding from on high, Away with their imprison'd children fly; Tears to the Waves, sighs to the Air they lend, And cries t'o're-take their dearest Pledges send; Spreading their arms to sea, as if they might, Quitting the land, follow the sails by flight. Now in suspence they stand, whether they may For quiet seas, and winds successful pray; Their minds 'twixt wrath and pitty hovering were, Nor know they what to wish, or what to fear; What barbarous usage waits them, when they come To that luxurious town Byzantium; Subjected to his power, who thought th'immense Worlds potent Master, yet is slave to sence Then wakes a thought in their maternal minde, Cruel, yet not in cruelty unkinde: They wish their injuries reveng'd might be, By storms, a threatning heaven, an angry sea; Malignant Stars, and furious winds may reign, Burying the ships in the vast watry plain. But straight that cruel thought from their breast flies, And thus what reason dictates, love denies. A stately ship plowing the waves there went, Excell'd the rest in height and ornament: Her glorious Poop of gold, whose flame did stain, And guild the blew enammel of the Main; In which a virgin did to exile pass; A fatal trophy she of conquest was; For the rude Thracian forcing her away, To buy one life a thousand deaths did pay. Oronta fair, whose Ancestors were they Who did long time the Cyprian Scepter sway, With her new beams encreas'd, &amp; made more bright Their ancient splendor with a truer light. Her wisdom doth her years and Sex out-went; More noble by her vertue, then descent: In this fair frame did a high spirit move, And with her face her soul in beauty strove. She did the Cnidian Goddess far excel, Sailing th'Ægean in a golden shell; She who with that false Trojan stole away, And quitted, with her faith, the Græcian Bay, Appear'd less fair on that unhappy shore, When she to Ilium fire and ruine bore; For from the eyes of this fair Captive came Such beams as might convert the world to flame. Nature diviner forms united here, Above the beauties mortals use to wear; The Heavens she did contract in one fair look; Roses and light she from the morning took; The Sun divided in her eyes, her hair Scatters his loose beams in the wanton air; Her beauty does so far transcend esteem, Beauties Idæa doth lesse beauty seem. Her sad Companions weep, yet she keeps dry Amidst these show'rs of tears her lively eye: Her lofty spirit cannot stoop so low Danger to fear, or fruitless prayers bestow. Confus'd her actions are, her looks severe, Here reserv'd thoughts deep resolution bear; Yet there was nothing in her face reveal'd Of that designe lay in her breast conceal'd. Thus with her false reasons; Shall the dead Their blood for us, and we tears only shed? They deceas'd gloriously, there is no way Now left us to escape, but dye as they: Death cannot be deni'd; with sacred fire Some power Celestial doth my breast inspire; My soul to Heaven inviting seems to cry Alas we cannot live, unless we dye. Beneath the Decks there is a place, where are The wicked instruments of Fire and War, Sulphureous Powder, Balls of Brass and Lead, A pondrous load, which when the fire doth spread Throughout the air, the lightning breaks asunder, And Canons from their hollow bosom thunder. When these the ships do mutually return, They now dart lightning, now with lightning burn. Th'Heroick Virgin, here intent, doth see Both time and place to her Design agree: Flames in her eyes, in her breast anger burns, Now to cold Ice, and strait to fire she turns, Shall the proud Turks (saith she) in triumph play, Boasting Oronta is their fetter'd Prey? They have not robb'd me of my liberty; Spight of these stubborn Bonds my soul is free. Behold in this close place an open way To freedom, here my Chains their ransom pay; Her earthly weight here off the soul may shake, And her swift flight to Heaven may freely take. Love for my sake no triumphs must pretend, Nor 'gainst a barbarous heart his Bow shall bend; To chaster zeal must yeeld his vain desire, And in celestial flames his flames expire. Such Fire I'le kindle as shall fatal prove, And those extinguish that are rais'd by Love. Masters with Slaves in Death shall equal be, And Captives gain o're Victors victory: End to our Wrongs and their Pride this shall give, And all at Death, e're at the shore arrive. To you bright flames that free me from this death My Body, I my Soul to Heaven bequeath. This said, the burning Torch she holds upright; And as about to throw, she shakes the light; Yet timerously bold, her heart relents, And of her former boldness she repents; Thus burning, freezing, sighing, dumb appears, A thousand times at once both dares and fears. At last, still do I doubt? still live? (she said,) They merit death that are of death afraid. With that the deadly flame she from her throws, Which in a moment up the powder blows: The hollow ship thunders, the dreadful cries And horrid noise the deafn'd air surprize; Death gave no time to fear the dismal light; The fire did sooner seize then did the fright; The bodies dead and half dead th'air do fill; Smoak sends up clouds, &amp; blood doth showers distil. Masts, Cordage, Decks, and Kell asunder flye, And of one ship a hundred floating lye. Of prisoners now the Guardians have no care, But all alike are hurri'd through the air: The fire, the Wealth, the Bodies all in one Together are in dark confusion gone. Some upwards mount, others fall down, and have Death in the fire, and in the flood a grave. So Ætna from her black internal parts Thunders aloud, and lightning upwards darts, Breathing out Sulphur from its hollow veins, The torrid air the borrowed heat retains: Stones fr? th'eternal shades to Heaven are thrown, The fields with showers of burning sand o're-flown. And whilst together smoak and fire ascend, Darkness and light for victory contend. In the destructive fury of the fire, She that first kindled it did first expire; Her body by this sudden force is born Into the air, in thousand pieces torn: Her mangled limbs dispersed at their fall, In the kind Sea receive their burial. Thus she at once is burnt, is torn, is drownd, A glorious death, e're she perceiv'd, she found. You that in marble, and in ancient Rowls, Make scrutiny for the Heroick souls, You by whom acts renown'd in peace or war, Eternized to future ages are, Fix here your thoughts, your studies, and your verse, And onely her immortal praise reherse: So you of wits, of women she the glory, You by Oronta live, she by your story Winds with the flames do happily conspire, And the whole Fleet alike receives the fire. Auster spreads wide the heat, all is o're-run A thousand fires delated into one. The crackling blaze, and dusky clouds that rise, Make bright the waters, and make dark the skies, Like burning Mists that in Earths bowels dwell, Darkness ascends, as if the Sea were Hell. All dye, yet all attempt their death to shun; Some hide them, some they know not whither run: The active flame in every part resides, Seizing the Mast, the Poop, the Prow, the sides. And to anticipate the Fates decree, Into the fire some leap, some to the Sea; Languishing hope is of all flight bereft, No means but death to scape from death is left. The bloody surface of the water bears Bows, Arrows, Ensigns, Helmets, Targets, Spears; Here bodies half alive, and there quite dead: A stranger Trunk joyns to an unknown Head. The tatter'd limbs divided are from limbs, Here broken bones, and there a half-skull swims. Some whilst they vomit blood do water drink, Some vainly thinking to save others, sink. The plunderer is plunder'd of his Prey, Spoils spread by fire upon the Water stray, The wealth of Cyprus burnt, yet drowned lyes; Seas swallow what a kingdom did comprize; The burning Timbers float in sea and blood, Carrying a fire triumphant o're the flood. The waters swoln with streams of goar look red, And dying men are mingled with the dead. Mean while from Cyprius sands the Mothers gaze Intentively upon the dismal blaze; Amaz'd to hear the seas with thunder roar, The air with smoak, the waves with light spread ore, A thousand hopeless heats in this fire freez, This fire extracts from eyes a thousand seas: Sighs from the land are sent, and tears are shed By those who dye with grief, to those are dead. The waters back the floating bodies drive, Which at their native soil at length arrive; In haste the Mothers (Mothers now no more) Collect th'unknown scorcht Reliques on the shore, Their grief augments, their cries they now raise higher, And in deep sighs their weary souls expire. The blameless Sea more then before offends, Whom it took living thence, dead back it sends. Yet to the dead the living envy bears, For weigh'd with such a death, life vile appears. The dead are free, but those to life confin'd Are miserable slaves to slaves design'd: Indulgent Fate by taking life from those, Hath rescu'd them from th'out-rage of their foes; These ever weary of their destiny, Suffer a thousand deaths before they dye. Such was Oronta's memorable Fate, Which some more noble Muse should celebrate; That all the World from the Suns early rise, Unto his set, her name may solemnize; That her example ever may remain, Who lost in fire, in Verse may live again: When my low thoughts to this high Theam aspire, I learn not how to praise, but to admire. ECHO In a solitary Grove, The sad witness of his Love, Poor Siringo (vainly who Did Licoris long pursue) Here his weary steps restrain'd: And so sweetly he complain'd, That the water, and the air, Wept, and sigh'd, his plaints to hear. Silvio overheard his speech, And engrav'd it on a Beech. Nymph said he, a Nymph thou wert, Now a naked voice thou art; Who words followst, though thy hast Onely can o'retake the last; Thou, who with this murmuring source, Birds, and Beasts, maintainst discourse, To these ruggid cliffs confin'd; Thou (ah none but thou) art kind: Who in pitty of my mone, Often dost forget thine own. Oracle of rural loves! Speaking shade! soul of the Groves! Who, through each deserted place, Dost thy savage Lover trace; Aery spirit! wandring noise! Unseen Image of the voice! Wilde inhabitant that dwels, In inhospitable Cells! If thou canst thy passion share, Hear, and pitty my despair. To the sad complaints I send, From thy hollow Grot attend: But my grief when I have told, To no other ear unfold, If thy own unhappy fate; Teach thee pitty to my state, Carefully this secret lock, In the caverns of that Rock. And let its rude breast become, To my woes, and thee, a tomb. Not that I fear to complain; Of my wrongs, and her disdain; But, I would not, at their story, The unpitying heavens should glory: Nor that this unhappy noise, Should disturb anothers joyes. Come then; to this dismal shade, Never by the Sun betraid, We together will retire: And our griefs alone expire. Thou our Destinies wilt finde If compar'd, alike unkinde. Equal Beauty crowns both them Who our amorous suits contemn. Thou to empty air didst turn, I in sighs dissolving mourn: Thou retir'st from humane sight, Courting loneness, flying light; I the deserts seeking, shun Equally, the World, and Sun. Hither often comes my Coy Fair one, like thy cruel Boy, And in this Brooks fluid glass, With delight surveys her face. But if she, like him, to none Save her self must kindness own, Why my heart will she not view; Where her form Loves Pencil drew? And if pleas'd with that she be, Love her self in loving me? If my sorrows, thus displai'd, Thy compassion may perswade; Quit these Beasts, and Forests wilde, To seek one then these less milde. Leave thy dwelling in this Stone, To finde out a living one. On thy wing my soft sighs bear, Breath them gently in her ear; That she thus may learn to prove Grief, though ignorant of Love. Or when day's bright Star the fields With meridian lustre guilds, If she seek out this retreat, To defend her from the heat; And upon this smooth bank ly, Teaching the birds harmony; Or discourse with thee: o'recome With her voice, oh be not dumb: Tell her what my grief affords, In entire, not broken words. Tell her, Thou, that to my Woe Both companion art, and Foe; The deep plaints my sorrows vent, In this hapless Languishment. Say how often I to thee. Have accus'd her cruelty; Taught thee her lov'd name t'invoke, Carv'd it upon every Oak; Trees Licoris onely bear To the Eye, Rocks to the Ear. Nymph, if thus thou wilt relieve me, Thousand Garlands I will give thee: Juno shall prove harsh no more, And thy humane vail restore: Heaven thy speech return, appeas'd, To thy Arms thy Lover pleas'd. And this Cave, which hath so long Been acquainted with thy wrong; Shall a faithful witness be Of the love 'twixt him, and thee. Fool! who vainly doth deceive thee! Or of Reason thus bereave thee? Why dost thou thy sad estate To the sportive streams relate? Comfort who, or pitty finds, In dumb Rocks, or in deaf Winds. And thou aid of all my Grief, Where I onely found Relief, My last accents who dost ease, Art as silent now, as these. Cruel Nymph! to rob my Joyes Voice it self is without Noyse. She, who did some speech retain, Her own sorrows to complain; Now in silence drowns her Grief, Lest she should give mine Relief. Wanton daughter of the Air! Who regard'st not my dispair, Know I can grieve inward too, And be dumb as well as you. LOVES EMBASSY. In the bright Region of the fertile East, Where constant calms smooth Heav'ns unclowded Brow, There lives an easie people, vow'd to rest, Who on Love onely all their hours bestow: By no unwelcome Discontents opprest; No cares, save those that from this Passion flow, Here raigns, here ever uncontroll'd did raign, The beauteous Queen sprung from the foming Main. Her Hand the Scepter bears, the Crown her Head, Her willing Vassals here their Tribute pay: Here is her sacred Power, and Statutes spread, Which all with cheerful forwardness obey: The Lover by affliction hither led, Receives relief, sent satisfi'd away: Here all enjoy, to give their soft flames ease, The pliant figures of their Mistresses. Love is the subject all their talk implies; Enamoured is the season of the Year: Every thing kills with Love, or for Love dies: Without Loves Pass, there is no coming near. Love is their Traffick, Stock, and Merchandize: Love is the onely business every where. When the young Trees thrust their fresh blossoms out, The smiling Branches seem with Love to sprout. Love every structure offers to the sight, And every stone his soft impression wears. The Fountains moving pitty, and delight, With amorous murmurs drop perswasive tears. The Rivers in their courses Love invite, Love is the onely sound their motion bears: The winds in whispers sooth these kinde desires, And fan with their mild breath, Loves glowing fires. Amidst a wide, green Plain, the Royal Seat Of this Majestick Queen is sweetly plac'd. About it runs a purling Rivolet, On either side by spreading trees embrac'd: From whose thick boughs, with constant shades repleat, The day in her Solstitial pride is chac'd: These bloom with fragrant blossoms all the year, And Nightingales their trillo practise here. A thousand petty Rills there are beside, Which in uncertain windings loosely stray: And by wilde Labyrinths their Current guide, One crossing wantonly the others way. The softer murmurs of whose pleasing tyde, To their Embrace the virgin flowers betray; Which, with a bashful niceness, trembling fall Into the stream, obsequious to Loves Call. A Tower there is which this large Plain defends, Kept by the Boy who o're all Souls prevails: Here every Morn and Evening, he ascends, And with his Arrows all the Earth assails. The Wounds he makes, Art with no cure befriends; His Mark he never sees, yet never fails. The subtile stroak, at first, infers no smart, But on the sudden, gnaws the tortur'd heart. Weary with shooting through the darkned air These feather'd tempests, mighty Love comes thence, Enclos'd by thousand lesser Loves, a share To every one alike he doth dispence. Affection is committed to their care: They also have the power to wound our sence; But their blunt shafts can onely raze the skin, And vulgar souls, to vulgar pleasures win. In the remotest corner of this land, Down in a vail, there is another seat: About it woody Mountains tottring stand, To overlook the shadows they beget: Whose twisted branches daylight countermand: With darkness all, all is with night repleat: The worst of sorrows, and misfortunes, dwell. With the sad owner of this luckless Cell. Dire Jealousie; fear'd, and afraid of all: Whom the Queen sometimes sees in complement, And to divert the mischiefs, that befall Her wretched servants, piously is bent. She her inheritance this place doth call; And from the Royal blood boasts her descent. The sacred Queen of Love, though she disdain her, Because so near a kin, bound to maintain her. The discontents that on this sad Wretch wait, She with her native joyes, sweetly allayes: Amongst her people, (strangers to debate) Here lives and loves, and others Loves surveys. Pleasure, her chamber, and her Chair of state, Richly adorns; Pleasure, her Limbs arrays. The Loves of such blest souls, as with most true Devotion serve, are always in her view. These swell with Pride, that their fair Queen, before Her other Subjects, their desires prefers: Of Lovers who obtain what they implore, The praise, and victory, is onely hers. With her, their pure affections sacred store, Repose the conquerd, and the Conquerers. Their stock continual Interest doth fill, Much by good Fate increasing more by ill: She all these suppliants distinctly knows. And purifies the flames wherein they burn. Much time with pious diligence bestows, To ease the miseries of such as mourn. Takes an exact account of all their woes, To give them of delight a full return. And to this end, in her admired name, A general assembly doth proclaim. Now rose the smiling Star that guilds the Face Of our dark sphear, at whose approach grow dim The sparkling gems of night, forc'd to give place To one whose beauty far out-rivals them; When Venus left her Court, the Plains to grace; Her Love, and Jealousie attended him. Jealousie, plague of every amorous breast, Which with most spight the fairest doth infest. Forth comes this Queen of Beauty, and Desire, Her tresses playing with the wanton air, Bright her Complexion is, white her Attire, Sweetness, and Majesty, her Glances share, Her Eyes, which Men adore, and Gods admire, Forbid to hope, nor suffer to despair. Including all the Graces in one look, That Zeuxes from Crotonian virgins took. When all her People were together met, First to the midst, then round about she goes; And as she views them, an enlivening heat On every heart her radiant eyes disclose: Commands her Son appoint to each his seat, And every Lover in his rank dispose; The little Herald, place for all prepares, According to the quality of their cares. She saw the Loves of all this numerous round, Alike successful were, alike were pleas'd. Their griefs by mutual kindness softned found; Their discontents by joynt delight appeas'd. All with fruition of their wishes crown'd; All of their sorrows by each other eas'd. She saw them in affection kindly strive, And by exchange their happy passions thrive. Happy indeed these present Lovers were; But of the absent, bitter discontents, In several shapes, were represented here; Unequal aims, the diff'rent accidents, Of Love, and Scorn, Temerity, and Fear: Perplexed thoughts, expecting worse events; And all the sad varieties of Fate, Which on these disagreeing Lovers wait. Seeing so many of her own undon, The Queen was mov'd with sence of their distress; And since no other way was left to shun The rigorous cause of their unhappiness, Strait on an Embassy commands her Son; And in this Language doth his Charge express; Whilst, as she spake, the listning winds were chain'd To her soft accents, Floods their Course restrain'd. Son! thou art equally concern'd with Me, In all mishaps that on our state depend: Thou seest the harms our subjects suffer; Thee To undeceive, and cure their Griefs, I send. A world of fickle, faithless souls, there be, Who to the sacred Name of Love pretend: And what more then my wrongs my thoughts doth vex, The blame of this, lies chiefly on our Sex. Indifferent Lovers, loosely by the same Affection, are at once, to many led: Inconstant, treacherously their faith disclaim, Their fleeting vows no sooner taught, then fled. Ambitious Honour court, whose sickly flame No longer lasts then by that fuel fed, These coyness counterfeit, and those desire; To stain my Name, and Credit, both conspire. But some there are, who impiously protest Against our Laws, and our just Power despise; To Scorn, and Pride, are votaries profest: And o're their fellow subjects tyrannize. These will infect, if not in time supprest, Our pure Religion with black Heresies. These, whom in vain it were with force t'invade, By Reason bend, and in these words perswade. Fair Rebels! who your lawful King depose, And fondly your Allegiance cast away; To give admittance to his mortal Foes; And in his room Disdain and Pride obey: 'Tis Love, who Beauty on the Fair bestows: Tribute to Love, the Fair are bound to pay: Him, who your beings gave, you would destroy, And 'gainst himself, the arms he lent imploy. This Deity, whose sacred Name you slight, Is Master of Content, commands all Pleasure; Will entertain you still with new Delight, More joyes, then howrs, your happy lives shall measure; 'Tis justice to your selves, to do him right; No other way left to secure your Treasure. Bold Time will force the Prize for which Love sues, And rob you of the wealth you would not use. Strict punishment, besides, you must expect From the just Powers you impiously incense: They your contempt severely will correct, In others to prevent the like offence. Your Prayers, too late presented, will reject; No vows, no tears, shall with their rage dispence, Choose then the safe, if not the pleasing state, Reward attends your Love, Revenge your Hate. This said, a general shout past through the throng; In which, her subjects their applause declare. Her Chariot then she mounts, and all along, Scatters rich Perfumes, through the ambient air. Thousands of Loves wait on her with a Song; All to her Court with equal Joy repair. There every Lover his delight renews; Whilst her glad Son, his Mothers Charge pursues. THE SOLITVDE. 'Twas now the blooming season of the year, And in disguise Europa's Ravisher (His brow arm'd with a Crescent, with such beams Encompast, as the Sun unclowded streams The sparkling glory of the Zodiak!) led His numerous Heard, along the azure mead. When he, whose right to beauty might remove The Youth of Ida from the Cup of Jove, Shipwrackt, repuls'd, and absent, did complain Of his hard Fate and Mistresses disdain. With such sad sweetness, that the Winds, and Sea, In sighs, and murmurs, kept him company. And mov'd with such a charitable care, As once Arion found a Plank prepare: A kind, small Piece of that tall Pine, which cou'd Defie the Winds whilst on the Hill it stood; Which Dolphin-like, the young Advent'rer saves, From the vast dangers of unbounded Waves. The greedy Sea, that swallowed him before, Now casts him up again upon the shore; Hard by a Rock, with reeds, &amp; warm down crown'd; Where Joves great Bird a Nest, he harbour found: And, wrapt in Froth and Sedges, kist the Sand, Then, hangs the Plank that wafted him to land, Upon the Cliff, which with glad Pride, endu'd The flattring trophy of his Gratitude. Disrob'd, his Garments next (from the swoln threads Wringing the Water he a drying spreads: Till all the briny drops they had suckt in The Suns warm flame lick'd gently oft agen: By this time Night began t'ungild the skies, Hils from the Sea, Seas from the Hils arise, Confusedly unequal; when once more Th'unhappy Youth, invested in the poor Remains of his late shipwrack, through sharp briars, And dusky shades up the high Rock aspires. The steep ascent scarce to be reach'd by Aide Of Wings, he climbs; less weary, then afraid. At last he gains the top; so strong, and high, As scaling dreaded not, nor Battery, An equal Judge, the Difference to decide, Twixt the mute Land, and ever-sounding tide. His steps now more secur'd; a glimmering light (The Pharos of some Cottage) takes his sight. Dear Beams! not Leda's sparkling Twins, saith he, Yet the sole Star that guides my destinie! May no unfriendly tree ecclipse thy Fire; Against thee, no malicious Blast conspire. As when the Huntsman, with fierce speed, makes plain The rugged Mountain, eager to attain The dark-skin'd Beast, on whose dark brow is plac'd A bright Tiara, with rich Lustre grac'd: A Gem (if Fame say true) whose glittr'ing Ray, Spight of the æmulous Stars, turns night to day; This stranger so measures with even Feet Th'uneven Thickets, his Polestar to meet. Barking to make th'approaching youth retire, The Dog, a wakeful Guardian, calls him nigher. And now the light he sees, whose dim beams broke So far through the thick shades a sturdy Oak; Which (like the Fly that in a Taper playes) Resolv'd to ashes in a sportive Blaze. Where he no sooner comes, but in free words, Such as no aiery Complement affords, He is bid welcome by a jovial Round Of simple Goatheards, who bright Vulcan crown'd. O happy ever open Mansion! The sacred Fane of Pales! Floras Throne! Thy builder drew no quaint Designe enchac't With curious Works, rear'd to a height so vast, As if Heavens Arch were but thy Cupula; Rafters of Oak, thatch'd with a little straw, Make thy poor Fabrick up; the Swain's defence Instead of dreadful Steel is Innocence; Who whistles home his Flock, injur'd by none: Oh happy ever open Mansion! Ambitious Dropsie shuns thy wholsom air, As she who Vipers makes her onely fair. Self-Love, that wanton Sphinx hath here no place; A wild beasts shape, beneath a virgins face: Who makes Narcissus now the Fountains fly, And in the Woods keep Eccho company. Nor profane Ceremony, who in gay Salutes, squanders Times precious lands away. At which the honest Countrey man doth laugh, Carelessly leaning on his crooked staff; Their art by his sincerity out-gon: O happy ever open Mansion. To thy low threshold Flatt'ry not resorts, The treacherous Syren of Imperial Courts: Round whom, so many shipwrackt vessels ly, Trophy's of her enchanting Harmony. Here Falsehood harbours not, handmaid to Pride, Whose guilded train she spreads her feet to hide. Nor shines a Princes dazling favour here, Which melts their Waxen Wings who fly too near, Into the foming Ocean headlong thrown. Oh happy! ever open Mansion! The savage Mountains courteous sons, with plain Civility, their strange guest entertain. Such us'd the first possessors of the wood, Whom th'Ash afforded covert, the Oak food. To spread their Board, a clean course cloth they get; And in a homely Pail, before him set Milk which that day the rising Morning spied, And blusht to see her white so far out-vied. A Goat, had been two hundred females Spouse Five year, nor spar'd the Grapes on Bacchus brows, (How little then his vine-yards!) was renown'd For numerous conquests; w?? Love always crown'd; (By a young Rebel slain, whose yellow beard Not fully grown, his horns as yet scarce hard, Who by this death a thousand lives preserv'd,) Powder'd, and died to Scarlet, in was serv'd. Then, on soft skins distended on the ground, They their tir'd limbs repose; sleeping more sound Then Princes that on Tyrian purple ly, Adorn'd with Millains rich embroidery. Not with the busie fumes of Wine opprest; Which with vain dreams disturb the rich mans rest: Whilst some ambitious toil he seems to take (Like Sisyphus,) more cozen'd when awake. Far from all noise they sleep securely here; Nor to be rows'd by Drums, or Trumpets fear. Onely Nights silence the fierce Dog deceaves, Chiding the winde for sporting with the leaves. Nor rose, till the wing'd Choristers oth'air, Did to the Sun the Morns approach declare: Who quits her fluid bed, and with new fire, Reguilds their humble mansions verdant spire. —difficiles valete nugæ.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A Platonick Discourse Upon LOVE. Written in Italian by John Picus Mirandula, In Explication of a Sonnet, by Hieronimo Benivieni. The Sonnet. I. Love, (whose hand guides my Hearts strict Reins, Nor, though he govern it, disdains To feed the Fire with pious care Which first himself enkindled there) Commands my backward Soul to tell What Flames within her Bosome dwell; Fear would perswade her to decline The charge of such a high designe; But all her weak reluctance fails, 'Gainst greater Force no Force avails. Love to advance her flight will lend Those wings by which he did descend Into my Heart, where he to rest For ever, long since built his Nest: I what from thence he dictates write, And draw him thus by his own Light. II. Love, flowing from the sacred Spring Of uncreated Good, I sing: When born; how Heaven he moves; the Soul Informs; and doth the World controwl; How closely luking in the heart, With his sharp weapons subtle art From heavy earth he Man unties, Enforcing him to reach the skies. How kindled, how he flames, how burns; By what laws guided now he turns To Heaven, now to the Earth descends, Now rests 'twixt both, to neither bends. Apollo, Thee I invocate, Bowing beneath so great a weight. Love, guide me through this dark designe, And imp my shorter wings with thine. III. VVhen from true Heav'n the sacred Sun Into th' Angelick Minde did run, And with enliv'ned Leaves adorn, Bestowing form on his firsteborn; Enflamed by innate Desires, She to her chiefest good aspires; By which reversion her rich Brest With various Figures is imprest; And by this love exalted, turns Into the Sun for whom she burns. This flame, rais'd by the Light that shin'd From Heav'n into th' Angelick Minde, Is eldest Loves religious Ray, By Wealth and Want begot that Day, When Heav'n brought forth the Queen, whose Hand The Cyprian Scepter doth Command. IV. This born in amorous Cypris armes, The Sun of her bright Beauty, warmes. From this our first desire accrues, Which in new fetters caught, pursues The honourable path that guides Where our eternal good resides. By this the fire, through whose fair beams Life from above to Mankinde streams, Is kindled in our hearts, which glow Dying, yet dying greater grow; By this th'immortal Fountain flows, Which all Heaven forms below, bestowes; By this descends that shower of light Which upwards doth our minds invite; By this th'Eternal Sun inspires And Souls with sacred lustre fires. V. As God doth to the Minde dispence Its Being, Life, Intelligence, So doth the Minde the Soul acquaint How t'understand, to move, to paint; She thus prepar'd, the Sun that shines In the Eternal Breast designes, And here what she includes diffuses, Exciting every thing that uses Motion and sense (beneath her state) To live, to know, to operate. Inferiour Venus hence took Birth; Who shines in Heav'n, but lives on Earth, And o're the World her shadow spreads: The elder in the Suns Glasse reads Her Face, through the confused skreen Of a dark Shade obscurely seen; She Lustre from the sun receives, And to the Other Lustre gives; Celestial Love on this depends, The younger, vulgar Love attends. VI. Form'd by th'eternal Look of God, From the Suns most sublime abode, The Soul descends into Mans Heart, Imprinting there with wondrous Art What Worth She borrowed of Her Starre, And brought in her Celestial Carre; As well as humane Matter yeilds, She thus her curious Mansion builds; Yet all those frames from the divine Impression differently decline: The Sun, who's figur'd here, his Beams Into anothers Bosome streams; In whose agreeing Soul he stayes, And guilds it with his virtuous Rayes: The Heart in which Affection's bred, Is thus by pleasing Errour fed. VII. The Heart where pleasing Errour raigns, This object as her Childe maintains, By the fair Light that in her shines (A rare Celestial Gift,) refines; And by degrees at last doth bring To her first splendours sacred Spring: From this divine Look, one Sun passes Through three refulgent Burning-glasses, Kindling all Beauty, which the Spirit, The Body, and the Minde inherit. These rich Spoyles, by th'Eye first caught, Are to the Souls next Handmaid brought, Who there resides: She to the Brest Sends them; reform'd, but not exprest: The Heart, from Matter Beauty takes, Of many one Conception makes; And what were meant by Natures Laws, Distinct, She in one Picture draws. VIII. The Heart by Love allur'd to see Within her self her Progenie; This, like the Suns reflected Rayes Vpon the Waters face, survayes; Yet some divine, though clouded Light Seems here to twinckle, and invite The pious Soul, a Beauty more Sublime, and Perfect to adore. Who sees no longer his dim shade Upon the Earths vast Globe display'd, But certain Lustre, of the True Suns truest Image, now in view. The Soul thus entring in the Minde, There such uncertainty doth finde, That she to clearer Light applies Her Armes, and near the first Sun flies: She by his splendour beautious grows, By loving whom all Beauty flows Upon the Minde, Soul, World, and All Included in this spacious Ball. IX. But hold! Love stops the forward Course That me beyound my scope would force. Great Power! if any Soul appears Who not alone the blossomes wears, But of the rich Fruit is possest, Lend him thy Light, deny the rest.</field>
