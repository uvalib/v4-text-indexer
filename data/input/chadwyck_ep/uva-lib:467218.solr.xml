      <field name="fulltext">BLACKMWORE MAIDENS. The primrwose in the sheÃ¤de do blow, The cowslip in the zun, The thyme upon the down do grow, The clote The water-lily. where streams do run; An' where do pretty maÃ¯dens grow An' blow, but where the tow'r Do rise among the bricken tuns, In Blackmwore by the Stour. If you could zee their comely gaÃ¯t, An' pretty feÃ¤ces' smiles, A-trippÃ¨n on so light o' waÃ¯ght, An' steppÃ¨n off the stiles; A-gwaÃ¯n to church, as bells do swing An' ring within the tow'r, You'd own the pretty maÃ¯dens' pleÃ¤ce Is Blackmwore by the Stour. If you vrom Wimborne took your road, To Stower or Paladore, An' all the farmers' housen show'd Their daughters at the door; You'd cry to bachelors at hwomeâ âHere, come: 'ithin an hour You'll vind ten maÃ¯dens to your mind, In Blackmwore by the Stour.â An' if you look'd 'ithin their door, To zee em in their pleÃ¤ce, A-doÃ¨n housework up avore Their smilÃ¨n mother's feÃ¤ce; You'd cryââWhy, if a man would wive An' thrive, 'ithout a dow'r, Then let en look en out a wife In Blackmwore by the Stour. As I upon my road did pass A school-house back in MaÃ¿, There out upon the beÃ¤ten grass Wer maÃ¯dens at their plaÃ¿; An' as the pretty souls did tweil An' smile, I cried, âThe flow'r O' beauty, then, is still in bud In Blackmwore by the Stour.â MY ORCHA'D IN LINDEN LEA. 'Ithin the woodlands, flow'ry gleÃ¤ded, By the woak tree's mossy moot, The sheenÃ¨n grass-bleÃ¤des, timber-sheÃ¤ded, Now do quiver under voot; An' birds do whissle over head, An' water's bubblÃ¨n in its bed, An' there vor me the apple tree Do leÃ¤n down low in Linden Lea. When leaves that leÃ¤tely wer a-springÃ¨n Now do feÃ¤de 'ithin the copse, An' paÃ¯nted birds do hush their zingÃ¨n Up upon the timber's tops; An' brown-leav'd fruit's a-turnÃ¨n red, In cloudless zunsheen, over head, Wi' fruit vor me, the apple tree Do leÃ¤n down low in Linden Lea. Let other vo'k meÃ¤ke money vaster In the aÃ¯r o' dark-room'd towns, I don't dread a peevish meÃ¤ster; Though noo man do heed my frowns, I be free to goo abrode, Or teÃ¤ke ageÃ¤n my hwomeward road To where, vor me, the apple tree Do leÃ¤n down low in Linden Lea. BISHOP'S CAENDLE. At peace day, who but we should goo To Caendle vor an' hour or two: As gaÃ¿ a day as ever broke Above the heads o' Caendle vo'k, Vor peace, a-come vor all, did come To them wi' two new friends at hwome. Zoo while we kept, wi' nimble peÃ¤ce, The wold dun tow'r avore our feÃ¤ce, The aÃ¯r, at last, begun to come Wi' drubbÃ¨ns ov a beÃ¤ten drum; An' then we heÃ¤rd the horns' loud droats PlaÃ¿ off a tuen's upper notes; An' a'ter that a-risÃ¨n cheÃ¤rm Vrom tongues o' people in a zwarm: An' zoo, at last, we stood among The merry feÃ¤ces o' the drong. An' there, wi' garlands all a-tied In wreaths an' bows on every zide, An' color'd flags, a fluttrÃ¨n high An' bright avore the sheenÃ¨n sky, The very guide-post wer a-drest Wi' posies on his eÃ¤rms an' breast. At last, the vo'k zwarm'd in by scores An' hundreds droo the gert barn-doors, To dine on English feÃ¤re, in ranks, A-zot on chairs, or stools, or planks, By bwoards a-reachÃ¨n, row an' row, Wi' cloths as white as driven snow. An' while they took, wi' merry cheer, Their pleÃ¤ces at the meat an' beer, The band did blow an' beÃ¤t aloud Their merry tuÃ¨ns to the crowd; An' slowly-zwingÃ¨n flags did spread Their hangÃ¨n colors over head. An' then the vo'k, wi' jaÃ¿ an' pride, Stood up in stillness, zide by zide, Wi' downcast heads, the while their friend Rose up avore the teÃ¤ble's end, An' zaid a timely greÃ¤ce, an' blest The welcome meat to every guest. An' then arose a mingled naÃ¯se O' knives an' pleÃ¤tes, an' cups an' traÃ¿s, An' tongues wi' merry tongues a-drown'd Below a deaf'nÃ¨n storm o' sound. An' zoo, at last, their worthy host Stood up to gi'e em all a twoast, That they did drink, wi' shouts o' glee, An' whirlÃ¨n eÃ¤rms to dree times dree. An' when the bwoards at last wer beÃ¤re Ov all the cloths an' goodly feÃ¤re, An' froth noo longer rose to zwim 'Ithin the beer-mugs sheenÃ¨n rim, The vo'k, a-streamÃ¨n drough the door, Went out to geÃ¤mes they had in store. An' on the blue-reÃ¤v'd waggon's bed, Above his vower wheels o' red, Musicians zot in rows, an' plaÃ¿d Their tuÃ¨ns up to chap an' maÃ¯d, That beÃ¤t, wi' plaÃ¿some tooes an' heels, The level ground in nimble reels. An' zome ageÃ¤n, a-zet in line, An' startÃ¨n at a given sign, Wi' outreach'd breast, a-breathÃ¨n quick Droo op'nÃ¨n lips, did nearly kick Their polls, a-runnÃ¨n sich a peÃ¤ce, Wi' streamÃ¨n heÃ¤ir, to win the reÃ¤ce. An' in the house, an' on the green, An' in the shrubb'ry's leafy screen, On ev'ry zide we zeed sich lots O' smilÃ¨n friends in happy knots, That I do think, that drough the feÃ¤st In Caendle, vor a day at leÃ¤st, You woudden vind a scowlÃ¨n feÃ¤ce Or dumpy heart in all the pleÃ¤ce. HAY MEAKENâNUNCHEN TIME. Anne an' John a-ta'kÃ¨n o't. A. Back here, but now, the jobber John Come by, an' cried, âWell done, zing on, I thought as I come down the hill, An' heÃ¤rd your zongs a-ringÃ¨n sh'ill, Who woudden like to come, an' fling A peÃ¤ir o' prongs where you did zing?â J. Aye, aye, he woudden vind it plaÃ¿, To work all day a-meÃ¤kÃ¨n haÃ¿, Or pitchÃ¨n o't, to eÃ¤rms a-spread By lwoaders, yards above his head, 'T'ud meÃ¤ke en wipe his drippÃ¨n brow. A. Or else a-reÃ¤kÃ¨n a'ter plow. J. Or workÃ¨n, wi' his nimble pick, A-stiffled wi' the haÃ¿, at rick. A. Our Company would suit en best, When we do teÃ¤ke our bit o' rest, At nunch, a-gather'd here below The sheÃ¤de theÃ¤se wide-bough'd woak do drow, Where hissÃ¨n froth mid rise, an' float In horns o' eÃ¤le, to wet his droat. J. Aye, if his swellÃ¨n han' could drag A meat-slice vrom his dinner bag. 'T'ud meÃ¤ke the busy little chap Look rather glum, to zee his lap Wi' all his meal ov woone dry crowst, An' vinny cheese so dry as dowst. A. Well, I dont grumble at my food, 'Tis wholesome, John, an' zoo 'tis good. J. Whose reÃ¤ke is that a-lyÃ¨n there? Do look a bit the woo'se vor wear. A. Oh! I mus' get the man to meÃ¤ke A tooth or two vor thik wold reÃ¤ke, 'Tis leÃ¤bor lost to strike a stroke Wi' him, wi' ha'f his teeth a-broke. J. I should ha' thought your han' too fine To break your reÃ¤ke, if I broke mine. A. The ramsclaws thin'd his wooden gum O' two teeth here, an' here were zome That broke off when I reÃ¤k'd a patch O' groun' wi' Jimmy, vor a match: An' here's a gap where woone or two Wer broke by Simon's clumsy shoe, An' when I gi'ed his poll a poke, Vor better luck, another broke. In what a veag have you a-swung Your pick, though, John? His stem's a-sprung. J. When I an' Simon had a het O' pookÃ¨n, yonder, vor a bet, The prongs o'n gi'd a tump a poke, An' then I vound the stem o'n broke, But they do meÃ¤ke the stems o' picks O' stuff so brittle as a kicks. A. There's poor wold JeÃ¤ne, wi' wrinkled skin, A-tellÃ¨n, wi' her peakÃ¨d chin, Zome teÃ¤le ov her young days, poor soul. Do meÃ¤ke the young-woones smile. 'Tis droll. What is it? Stop, an' let's goo near. I do like theÃ¤se wold teÃ¤les. Let's hear. A FATHER OUT, AN' MOTHER HWOME. The snow-white clouds did float on high In shoals avore the sheenÃ¨n sky, An' runnÃ¨n weÃ¤ves in pon' did cheÃ¤se Each other on the water's feÃ¤ce, As hufflÃ¨n win' did blow between The new-leav'd boughs o' sheenÃ¨n green. An' there, the while I walked along The path, drough leÃ¤ze, above the drong, A little maÃ¯d, wi' bloomÃ¨n feÃ¤ce, Went on up hill wi' nimble peÃ¤ce, A-leÃ¤nÃ¨n to the right-han' zide, To car a basket that did ride, A-hangÃ¨n down, wi' all his heft, Upon her elbow at her left. An' yet she hardly seem'd to bruise The grass-bleÃ¤des wi' her tiny shoes, That pass'd each other, left an' right, In steps a'most too quick vor zight. But she'd a-left her mother's door A-bearÃ¨n vrom her little store Her father's welcome bit o' food, Vor he wer out at work in wood; An' she wer' bless'd wi' mwore than zwomeâ A father out, an' mother hwome. An' there, a-vell'd 'ithin the copse, Below the timber's new-leav'd tops, Wer ashen poles, a-castÃ¨n straÃ¯ght, On primrwose beds, their langthy waÃ¯ght; Below the yollow light, a-shed Drough boughs upon the vi'let's head, By climÃ¨n ivy, that did reach, A-sheenÃ¨n roun' the dead-leav'd beech. An' there her father zot, an' meÃ¤de His hwomely meal bezide a gleÃ¤de; While she, a-croopÃ¨n down to ground, Did pull the flowers, where she vound The droopÃ¨n vi'let out in blooth, Or yollow primrwose in the lewth, That she mid car em proudly back, An' zet em on her mother's tack; Vor she wer bless'd with mwore than zomeâ A father out, an' mother hwome. A father out, an' mother hwome, Be blessÃ¨ns soon a-lost by zome; A-lost by me, an' zoo I praÃ¿'d They mid be speÃ¤r'd the little maÃ¯d. RIDDLES. Anne an' Joey a-ta'ken. A. A plague! theÃ¤se cow wont stand a bit, Noo sooner do she zee me zit AgeÃ¤n her, than she's in a trot, A-runnÃ¨n to zome other spot. J. Why 'tis the dog do sceÃ¤re the cow, He worried her a-vield benow. A. Goo in, Ah! Liplap, where's your tail! J. He's gone, then up athirt the raÃ¯l. Well, thik there cow's a come to hand A goodish milcher. A. If she'd stand But then she'll steÃ¤re an' sheÃ¤ke wi' fright To zee a dumbledore in flight. Last week she het the pail a flought, An' flung my meal o' milk half out. J. Ha! Ha! But Anny, here, what lout Ha' broke your small paÃ¯l's bottom out? A. What lout indeed! What do ye own The neÃ¤me? What dropp'd en on a stwone? J. Hee! Hee! Well now he's out o' trim Wi' n'ar a bottom to en; Could you still vill en' to the brim An' let noo milk run drough en? A. Aye, as for nonsense, Joe, your head Do hold it all so tight's a blather, But if 'tis any good, do shed It all so leÃ¤ky as a lather. Could you vill paÃ¯ls 'ithout a bottom, Yourself that be so deeply skill'd? J. Well, yees, I could, if I'd a-got em Inside o' bigger woones a-vill'd. A. La! that is zome'hat vor to hatch! Here answer me theÃ¤se little catch. There's horn vor Goodman's eye-zight seÃ¤ke; There's horn vor Goodman's mouth to teÃ¤ke; There's horn vor Goodman's ears, as well As horn vor Goodman's nose to smellâ What horns be they, then? Do your hat Hold wit enough to tell us that? J. Oh! horns! but no, I'll tell ye what, My cow is hornless, an' she's not. Not, Saxon-English knot, is Dorset for hornless. A. Horn vor the mouth's a hornen cup. J. An' eÃ¤le 's good stuff to vill en up. A. An' horn vor eyes is horn vor light, Vrom Goodman's lantern a'ter night; Horn vor the ears is woone to sound Vor hunters out wi' ho'se an' hound; But horn to smell, an' not to drink o't, Is hartshorn! There now, what d'ye think o't? J. How proud you be! if I could paÃ¯nt ye! Hartshorn is horn! oh! I shall faÃ¯nty! Well here then, Anne, while we be at it, 'S a ball vor you if you can bat it. On dree-lags, two-lags, by the zide O' vowr-lags, woonce did zit wi' pride, When vow'r-lags, wi' a smartish prick, Vrom zix-lags, het two lags a kick. An' two an' dree-lags vell, all vive, Slap down, zome dead an' zome alive. A. Teeh! heeh! what have ye now then, Joe, At last, to meÃ¤ke a riddle o'? J. Your dree-lagg'd stool woone night did bear Up you a milkÃ¨n wi' a pair; An' there a zix-lagg'd stout Stout, the gadfly. did prick Your vow'r-lagg'd cow, an' meÃ¤ke her kick, A-hettÃ¨n, wi' a pretty pat, Your stool an' you so flat's a mat. You scrambled up a little dirty, But I do hope it didden hurt ye. A. You hope, indeed! a likely ceÃ¤se, Wi' thik broad grin athirt your feÃ¤ce. You saucy good-vor-nothÃ¨n chap, I'll gi'e your grinnÃ¨n feÃ¤ce a slap, Your drawlÃ¨n tongue can only run To turn a body into fun. J. Oh! I woont do't ageÃ¤n. Oh! dear! Till next time, Anny. Oh! my ear! Oh! Anne, why you've a-het my hat 'Ithin the milk, now look at that. A. Do sar ye right, then, I don't ceÃ¤re. I'll thump your noddle,âthereâthereâthere. DAY'S WORK A-DONE. And oh! the jaÃ¿ our rest did yield, At evenÃ¨n by the mossy wall, When we'd a-work'd all day a-vield, While zummer zuns did rise an' vall, As there a-lettÃ¨n Goo all frettÃ¨n, An' vorgettÃ¨n all our tweils, We zot among our childern's smiles. An' under skies that glitter'd white, The while our smoke, arisÃ¨n blue, Did melt in aiÃ«r, out o' zight, Above the trees that kept us lew; Wer birds a-zingÃ¨n, Tongues a-ringÃ¨n, Childern springÃ¨n, vull o' jaÃ¿, A-finishÃ¨n the day in plaÃ¿. An' back behind, a-stannÃ¨n tall, The cliff did feÃ¤ce the western light; Avore us wer the water-fall, A-rottlÃ¨n loud, an' foamÃ¨n white. An' leaves did quiver, Gnots did whiver, By the river, where the pool, In evenÃ¨n aÃ¯r did glissen cool. An' childern there, a-runnÃ¨n wide, Did plaÃ¿ their geÃ¤mes along the grove, Vor though 'twer ouer jaÃ¿ to bide A-zot at rest, 'twer theirs to move. The while my smilÃ¨n JeÃ¤ne, beguilÃ¨n, All my tweilÃ¨n, wi' her ceÃ¤re, Did call me to my evenÃ¨n feÃ¤re. THE WAGGON A-STOODED. Dree o'm a-ta'kÃ¨n o't. (1) Well, here we be, then, wi' the vu'st poor lwoad O' vuzz we brought, a-stoodÃ¨d in the road. (2) The road, George, no. There's na'r a road. That's wrong. If we'd a road, we mid ha' got along. (1) Noo road! Yees 'tis, the road that we do goo. (2) Do goo, George, no. The pleÃ¤ce we can't get drough. (1) Well, there, the vu'st lwoad we've a-haul'd to day Is here a-stoodÃ¨d in theÃ¤se bed o' clay. Here's rotten groun'! an' how the wheels do cut! The little woone's a-zunk up to the nut. (3) An' yeet this rotten groun' don't reach a lug. (1) Well, come, then, gi'e the plow another tug. (2) They meÃ¤res wull never pull the waggon out, A-lwoaded, an' a-stoodÃ¨d in thik rout. (3) We'll try. Come, Smiler, come! C' up, Whitevoot, gee! (2) White-voot wi' lags all over mud! Hee! Hee! (3) 'Twoon't wag. We shall but snap our gear, An' overstraÃ¯n the meÃ¤res. 'Twoon't wag, 'tis clear. (1) That's your work, William. No, in coo'se, 'twoon't wag. Why did ye dr?ve en into theÃ¤se here quag? The vore-wheels be a-zunk above the nuts. (3) What then? I coulden leÃ¤ve the beÃ¤ten track, To turn the waggon over on the back Ov woone o' theÃ¤sem emmet-butts. If you be sich a dr?ver, an' do know't, You dr?ve the plow, then; but you'll overdrow't. (1) I dr?ve the plow, indeed! Oh! yees, what, now The wheels woont wag, then, I mid dr?ve the plow! We'd better dig away the groun' below The wheels. (2) There's nar' a speÃ¤de to dig wi'. (1) An' teÃ¤ke an' cut a lock o' frith, an' drow Upon the clay. (2) Nor hook to cut a twig wi'. (1) Oh! here's a bwoy a-comÃ¨n. Here, my lad, Dost know vor a'r a speÃ¤de, that can be had? (B) At father's. (1) Well, where's that? (Bwoy) At Sam'el Riddick's. (1) Well run, an' ax vor woone. Fling up your heels, An' mind: a speÃ¤de to dig out theÃ¤sem wheels, An' hook to cut a little lock o' widdicks. (3) Why, we shall want zix ho'ses, or a dozen, To pull the waggon out, wi' all theÃ¤se vuzzen. (1) Well, we mus' lighten en; come, JeÃ¤mes, then, hop Upon the lwoad, an' jus' fling off the top. (2) If I can clim' en; but 'tis my consaÃ¯t, That I shall overzet en wi' my waÃ¯ght. (1) You overzet en! No, JeÃ¤mes, he won't vall, The lwoad's a-built so firm's a wall. (2) Here, gie's a vootÃ¨n. There, Oh! George, 'twoon't stand, Your firm's a wall, is all so loose as zand; 'Tis all a-come to pieces. Oh! TeÃ¤ke ceÃ¤re! Ho! I'm a-vallÃ¨n, vuzz an' all! HaÃ«! There! (1) Lo'k there, thik fellor is a-vell lik' lead, An' half the fuzzen wi'n, heels over head! There 's all the vuzz a-lyÃ¨n lik' a staddle, An' he a-deÃ¤b'd wi' mud. Oh! Here's a caddle! (3) An' zoo you soon got down zome vuzzen, Jimmy. (2) Yees, I do know 'tis down, I brought it wi' me. (3) Your lwoad, George, wer a rather slick-built thing, But there, 'twer prickly vor the hands! Did sting? (1) Oh! yees, d'ye teÃ¤ke me vor a nincompoop, No, no. The lwoad wer up so firm 's a rock, But two o' theÃ¤sem emmet-butts would knock The tightest barrel out o' hoop. (3) Oh! now then, here's the bwoy a-bringÃ¨n back The speÃ¤de. Well done, my man. That idden slack. (2) Well done, my lad, sha't have a ho'se to ride When thou'st a meÃ¤re. (Bwoy) Next never's-tide. (3) Now let's dig out a spit or two O' clay, a-vore the little wheels; Oh! so's, I can't pull up my heels, I be a-stogg'd up over shoe. (1) Oh! William, come! Why you do spuddle So weak's a child. How you do muddle! Gi'e me the speÃ¤de. A pig would poke it out A good deal vaster wi' his snout. (3) Oh! so's, d'ye hear it, then. How we can thunder! How big we be, then George! what next I wonder? (1) Now, William, gi'e the waggon woone mwore twitch, The wheels be free, an' 'tis a lighter nitch. (3) Come, Smiler, gee! C'up, White-voot. (1) That wull do. (2) Do wag. (1) Do goo at last. (3) Well done. 'Tis drough. (1) Now, William, till you have mwore ho'ses' lags, Don't dr?ve the waggon into theÃ¤sem quags. (3) You build your lwoads up tight enough to ride. (1) I can't do less, d'ye know, wi' you vor guide. GWAIN DOWN THE STEPS VOR WATER. While zuns do roll vrom east to west To bring us work, or leÃ¤ve us rest, There down below the steep hill-zide, Drough time an' tide, the spring do flow; An' mothers there, vor years a-gone, Lik' daughters now a-comÃ¨n on, To bloom when they be weak an' wan, Went down the steps vor water. An' what do yonder ringers tell A-ringÃ¨n changes, bell by bell; Or what's a-show'd by yonder zight O' vo'k in white, upon the road, But that by John o' Woodleys zide, There's now a-blushÃ¨n vor his bride, A pretty maÃ¯d that vu'st he spied, GwaÃ¯n down the steps vor water. Though she, 'tis true, is feÃ¤ir an' kind, There still be mwore a-left behind; So cleÃ¤n 's the light the zun do gi'e, So sprack 's a bee when zummer 's bright; An' if I've luck, I woont be slow To teÃ¤ke off woone that I do know, A-trippÃ¨n gaÃ¯ly to an' fro, Upon the steps vor water. Her father idden poorâbut vew In parish be so well to do; Vor his own cows do swing their taÃ¯ls Behind his paÃ¯ls, below his boughs: An' then ageÃ¤n to win my love, Why, she's as hwomely as a dove, An' don't hold up herzelf above GwaÃ¯n down the steps vor water. GwaÃ¯n down the steps vor water! No! How handsome it do meÃ¤ke her grow. If she'd be straÃ¯ght, or walk abrode, To tread her road wi' comely gaÃ¯t, She coulden do a better thing To zet herzelf upright, than bring Her pitcher on her head, vrom spring Upon the steps, wi' water. No! don't ye neÃ¤me in woone seÃ¤me breath Wi' bachelors, the husband's he'th; The happy pleÃ¤ce, where vingers thin Do pull woone's chin, or pat woone's feÃ¤ce. But still the bleÃ¤me is their's, to slight Their happiness, wi' such a zight O' maÃ¯dens, mornÃ¨n, noon, an' night, A-gwaÃ¯n down steps vor water. ELLEN BRINE OF ALLENBURN. Noo soul did hear her lips complaÃ¯n, An' she 's a-gone vrom all her paÃ¯n, An' others' loss to her is gaÃ¯n For she do live in heaven's love; Vull many a longsome day an' week She bore her aÃ¯lÃ¨n, still, an' meek; A-workÃ¨n while her strangth held on, An' guidÃ¨n housework, when 'twer gone. Vor Ellen Brine ov Allenburn, Oh! there be souls to murn. The last time I'd a-cast my zight Upon her feÃ¤ce, a-feÃ¤ded white, Wer in a zummer's mornÃ¨n light In hall avore the smwold'rÃ¨n vire, The while the childern beÃ¤t the vloor, In plaÃ¿, wi' tiny shoes they wore, An' call'd their mother's eyes to view The feÃ¤ts their little limbs could do. Oh! Ellen Brine ov Allenburn, They childern now mus' murn. Then woone, a-stoppÃ¨n vrom his reÃ¤ce, Went up, an' on her knee did pleÃ¤ce His hand, a-lookÃ¨n in her feÃ¤ce, An' wi' a smilÃ¨n mouth so small, He zaid, âYou promised us to goo To Shroton feÃ¤ir, an' teÃ¤ke us two!â She heÃ¤rd it wi' her two white ears, An' in her eyes there sprung two tears Vor Ellen Brine ov Allenburn Did veel that they mus' murn. September come, wi' Shroton feÃ¤ir, But Ellen Brine wer never there! A heavy heart wer on the meÃ¤re Their father rod his hwomeward road. 'Tis true he brought zome feÃ¤rÃ¨ns back, Vor them two childern all in black; But they had now, wi' plaÃ¿things new, Noo mother vor to shew em to, Vor Ellen Brine ov Allenburn Would never mwore return. THE MOTHERLESS CHILD. The zun'd a-zet back t'other night, But in the zettÃ¨n pleÃ¤ce The clouds, a-redden'd by his light, Still glow'd avore my feÃ¤ce. An' I've a-lost my MeÃ¤ry's smile, I thought; but still I have her chile, Zoo like her, that my eyes can treÃ¤ce The mother's in her daughter's feÃ¤ce. O little feÃ¤ce so near to me, An' like thy mother's gone; why need I zay Sweet night cloud, wi' the glow o' my lost day, Thy looks be always dear to me. The zun'd a-zet another night; But, by the moon on high, He still did zend us back his light Below a cwolder sky. My MeÃ¤ry's in a better land I thought, but still her chile's at hand, An' in her chile she'll zend me on Her love, though she herself's a-gone. O little chile so near to me, An' like thy mother gone; why need I zay, Sweet moon, the messenger vrom my lost day, Thy looks be always dear to me. THE LEADY'S TOWER. An' then we went along the gleÃ¤des O' zunny turf, in quiv'rÃ¨n sheÃ¤des, A-windÃ¨n off, vrom hand to hand, Along a path o' yollow zand, An' clomb a stickle slope, an' vound An open patch o' lofty ground, Up where a steÃ¤tely tow'r did spring, So high as highest larks do zing. âOh! MeÃ¤ster Collins,â then I zaid, A-lookÃ¨n up wi' back-flung head; Vor who but he, so mild o' feÃ¤ce, Should teÃ¤ke me there to zee the pleÃ¤ce. âWhat is it then theÃ¤se tower do mean, A-built so feÃ¤ir, an' kept so cleÃ¤n?â âAh! me,â he zaid, wi' thoughtvul feÃ¤ce, â'Twer grief that zet theÃ¤se tower in pleÃ¤ce. The squier's e'thly life's a-blest Wi' gifts that mwost do teÃ¤ke vor best; The lofty-pinion'd rwufs do rise To screen his head vrom stormy skies; His land's a-spreadÃ¨n roun' his hall, An' hands do leÃ¤bor at his call; The while the ho'se do fling, wi' pride, His lofty head where he do guide; But still his e'thly jaÃ¿'s a-vled, His woone true friend, his wife, is dead. Zoo now her happy soul's a-gone, An' he in grief's a-ling'rÃ¨n on, Do do his heart zome good to show, His love to flesh an' blood below. An' zoo he rear'd, wi' smitten soul, TheÃ¤se LeÃ¤dy's Tower upon the knowl. An' there you'll zee the tow'r do spring Twice ten veet up, as roun's a ring, Wi' pillars under mwolded eÃ¤ves, Above their heads a-carv'd wi' leaves; An' have to peÃ¤ce, a-walkÃ¨n round His voot, a hunderd veet o' ground. An' there, above his upper wall, A roundÃ¨d tow'r do spring so tall 'S a springÃ¨n arrow shot upright, A hunderd giddy veet in height. An' if you'd like to straÃ¯n your knees A-climÃ¨n up above the trees, To zee, wi' slowly-wheelÃ¨n feÃ¤ce, The vur-sky'd land about the pleÃ¤ce, You'll have a flight o' steps to wear Vor forty veet, up steÃ¤ir by steÃ¤ir, That roun' the risÃ¨n tow'r do wind, Like withwind roun' the saplÃ¨n's rind, An' reach a landÃ¨n, wi' a seat, To rest at last your weary veet, 'Ithin a breast be-screenÃ¨n wall, To keep ye vrom a longsome vall. An' roun' the windÃ¨n steÃ¤irs do spring, AÃ¯ght stwonÃ¨n pillars in a ring, A-reachÃ¨n up their heavy strangth, Drough forty veet o' slender langth, To end wi' carvÃ¨d heads below The broad-vloor'd landÃ¨n's aÃ¯ry bow. AÃ¯ght zides, as you do zee, do bound The lower buildÃ¨n on the ground, An' there in woone, a two-leav'd door Do zwing above the marble vloor: An' aye, as luck do zoo betide Our comÃ¨n, wi' can goo inside. The door is open now. An' zoo The keeper kindly let us drough. There as we softly trod the vloor O' marble stwone, 'ithin the door, The echoes ov our vootsteps vled Out roun' the wall, and over head; And there a-paÃ¯nted, zide by zide, In memory o' the squier's bride, In zeven paÃ¯ntÃ¨ns, true to life, Wer zeven zights o' wedded life.â Then MeÃ¤ster Collins twold me all The teÃ¤les a-paÃ¯ntÃ¨d roun' the wall; An' vu'st the bride did stan' to plight Her weddÃ¨n vow, below the light A-shootÃ¨n down, so bright's a fleÃ¤me, In drough a churches window freÃ¤me. An' near the bride, on either hand, You'd zee her comely bridemaÃ¯ds stand, Wi' eyelashes a-bent in streÃ¤ks O' brown above their bloomÃ¨n cheÃ¤ks; An' sheenÃ¨n feÃ¤ir, in mellow light, Wi' flowÃ¨n heÃ¤ir, an' frocks o' white. âAn' here,â good MeÃ¤ster Collins cried, âYou'll zee a creÃ¤dle at her zide, An' there's her child, a-lyÃ¨n deep 'Ithin it, an' a-gone to sleep, Wi' little eyelashes a-met In fellow streÃ¤ks, as black as jet; The while her needle, over head, Do nimbly leÃ¤d the snow-white thread, To zew a robe her love do meÃ¤ke Wi' happy leÃ¤bor vor his seÃ¤ke. âAn' here a-geÃ¤n's another pleÃ¤ce, Where she do zit wi' smilÃ¨n feÃ¤ce, An' while her bwoy do leÃ¤n, wi' pride, AgeÃ¤n her lap, below her side, Her vinger tip do leÃ¤d his look To zome good words o' God's own book. âAn' next you'll zee her in her pleÃ¤ce, Avore her happy husband's feÃ¤ce, As he do zit, at evenÃ¨n-tide, A-restÃ¨n by the vier-zide. An' there the childern's heads do rise, Wi' laughÃ¨n lips, an' beamÃ¨n eyes, Above the bwoard, where she do lay Her sheenÃ¨n tacklÃ¨n, wi' the tea. âAn' here another zide do show Her vingers in her scizzars' bow, Avore two daughters, that do stand, Wi' leÃ¤rnsome minds, to watch her hand A-sheÃ¤pÃ¨n out, wi' skill an' ceÃ¤re, A frock vor them to zew an' wear. âThen next you'll see her bend her head Above her aÃ¯lÃ¨n husband's bed, A-fannÃ¨n, wi' an inward praÃ¿'r, His burnÃ¨n brow wi' beÃ¤ten aÃ¯r; The while the clock, by candle light, Do show that 'tis the dead o' night. âAn' here ageÃ¤n upon the wall, Where we do zee her last ov all, Her husband's head's a-hangÃ¨n low, 'Ithin his hands in deepest woe. An' she, an angel ov his God, Do cheer his soul below the rod, A-liftÃ¨n up her han' to call His eyes to writÃ¨n on the wall, As white as is her spotless robe, âHast thou rememberÃ¨d my servant Job?â âAn' zoo the squire, in grief o' soul, Built up the Tower upon the knowl.â FATHERHOOD. Let en zit, wi' his dog an' his cat, Wi' their noses a-turn'd to the vire, An' have all that a man should desire; But there idden much reÃ¤dship in that. Whether vo'k mid have childern or no, Wou'dden meÃ¤ke mighty odds in the maÃ¯n; They do bring us mwore jaÃ¿ wi' mwore ho, An' wi' nwone we've less jaÃ¿ wi' less paÃ¯n. We be all lik' a zull's idle sheÃ¤re out, An' shall rust out, unless we do wear out, Lik' do-nothÃ¨n, rue-nothÃ¨n, Dead alive dumps. As vor me, why my life idden bound To my own heart alwone, among men; I do live in myzelf, an' ageÃ¤n In the lives o' my childern all round: I do live wi' my bwoy in his plaÃ¿, An' ageÃ¤n wi' my maÃ¯d in her zongs; An' my heart is a-stirr'd wi' their jaÃ¿, An' would burn at the zight o' their wrongs. I ha' nine lives, an' zoo if a half O'm do cry, why the rest o'm mid laugh All so plaÃ¿vully, jaÃ¿vully, Happy wi' hope. T'other night I come hwome a long road, When the weather did sting an' did vreeze; An' the snowâvor the day had a-snow'dâ Wer avroze on the boughs o' the trees; An' my tooes an' my vingers wer num', An' my veet wer as lumpy as logs, An' my ears wer so red's a cock's cwom'; An' my nose wer as cwold as a dog's; But as soon's I got hwome I vorgot Where my limbs wer a-cwold or wer hot, When wi' loud cries an' proud cries They coll'd me so cwold. Vor the vu'st that I happen'd to meet Come to pull my gertcwoat vrom my eÃ¤rm, An' another did rub my feÃ¤ce warm, An' another hot-slipper'd my veet; While their mother did cast on a stick, Vor to keep the red vier alive; An' they all come so busy an' thick As the bees vlee-Ã¨n into their hive, An' they meÃ¤de me so happy an' proud, That my heart could ha' crow'd out a-loud; They did tweil zoo, an' zmile zoo, An' coll me so cwold. As I zot wi' my teacup, at rest, There I pull'd out the taÃ¿s I did bring; Men a-kickÃ¨n, a-wagg'd wi' a string, An' goggle-ey'd dolls to be drest; An' oh! vrom the childern there sprung Such a charm when they handled their taÃ¿s, That vor pleasure the bigger woones wrung Their two hands at the zight o' their jaÃ¿s; As the bwoys' bigger vaÃ¯ces vell in Wi' the maÃ¯dens a-titterÃ¨n thin, An' their dancÃ¨n an' prancÃ¨n, An' little mouth's laughs. Though 'tis hard stripes to breed em all up, If I'm only a-blest vrom above, They'll meÃ¤ke me amends wi' their love, Vor their pillow, their pleÃ¤te, an' their cup; Though I shall be never a-spweil'd Wi' the service that money can buy; Still the hands ov a wife an' a child Be the blessÃ¨ns ov low or ov high; An' if there be mouths to be ved, He that zent em can zend me their bread, An' will smile on the chile That's a-new on the knee. THE MAID O' NEWTON. In zummer, when the knaps wer bright In cool-aÃ¯r'd evenÃ¨n's western light, An' haÃ¿ that had a-dried all day, Did now lie grey, to dewy night; I went, by happy chance, or doom, Vrom Broadwoak Hill, athirt to Coomb, An' met a maÃ¯d in all her bloom: The feaÃ¯rest maÃ¯d o' Newton. She bore a basket that did ride So light, she didden leÃ¤n azide; Her feÃ¤ce wer oval, an' she smil'd, So sweet's a child, but walk'd wi' pride. I spoke to her, but what I zaid I didden know; wi' thoughts a-vled, I spoke by heart, an' not by head, Avore the maÃ¯d o' Newton. I call'd her, oh! I don't know who, Twer by a neÃ¤me she never knew; An' to the heel she stood upon, She then brought on her hinder shoe, An' stopp'd avore me, where we met, An' wi' a smile woone can't vorget, She zaid, wi' eyes a-zwimmÃ¨n wet, âNo, I be woone o' Newton.â Then on I rambled to the west, Below the zunny hangÃ¨n's breast, Where, down athirt the little stream, The brudge's beam did lie at rest: But all the birds, wi' lively glee, Did chirp an' hop vrom tree to tree, As if it wer vrom pride, to zee Goo by the maÃ¯d o' Newton. By fancy led, at evenÃ¨n's glow, I woonce did goo, a-rovÃ¨n slow, Down where the elÃ¨ms, stem by stem, Do stan' to hem the grove below; But after that, my veet vorzook The grove, to seek the little brook At Coombs, where I mid zometimes look, To meet the maÃ¯d o' Newton. CHILDHOOD. Aye, at that time our days wer but vew, An' our lim's wer but small, an' a-growÃ¨n; An' then the feÃ¤ir worold wer new, An' life wer all hopevul an' gaÃ¿; An' the times o' the sproutÃ¨n o' leaves, An' the cheÃ¤k-burnÃ¨n seasons o' mowÃ¨n, An' bindÃ¨n o' red-headed sheaves, Wer all welcome seasons o' jaÃ¿. Then the housen seem'd high, that be low, An' the brook did seem wide that is narrow, An' time, that do vlee, did goo slow, An' veelÃ¨ns now feeble wer strong, An' our worold did end wi' the neÃ¤mes Ov the Sha'sbury Hill or Bulbarrow; An' life did seem only the geÃ¤mes That we plaÃ¿'d as the days rolled along. Then the rivers, an' high-timber'd lands, An' the zilvery hills, 'ithout buyÃ¨n, Did seem to come into our hands Vrom others that own'd em avore; An' all zickness, an' sorrow, an' need, Seem'd to die wi' the wold vo'k a-dyÃ¨n, An' leÃ¤ve us vor ever a-freed Vrom evils our forefathers bore. But happy be childern the while They have elders a-livÃ¨n to love em, An' teÃ¤ke all the wearisome tweil That zome hands or others mus' do; Like the low-headed shrubs that be warm, In the lewth o' the trees up above em, A-screen'd vrom the cwold blowÃ¨n storm That the timber avore em must rue. MEARY'S SMILE. When mornÃ¨n winds, a-blowÃ¨n high. Do zweep the clouds vrom all the sky, An' laurel-leaves do glitter bright, The while the newly broken light Do brighten up, avore our view, The vields wi' green, an' hills wi' blue; What then can highten to my eyes The cheerful feÃ¤ce ov e'th an' skies, But MeÃ¤ry's smile, o' Morey's Mill, My rwose o' Mowy Lea. An' when, at last, the evenÃ¨n dews Do now begin to wet our shoes; An' night's a-ridÃ¨n to the west, To stop our work, an' gi'e us rest, Oh! let the candle's ruddy gleÃ¤re But brighten up her sheenÃ¨n heÃ¤ir; Or else, as she do walk abroad, Let moonlight show, upon the road, My MeÃ¤ry's smile, o' Morey's Mill, My rwose o' Mowy Lea. An' O! mid never tears come on, To wash her feÃ¤ce's blushes wan, Nor kill her smiles that now do plaÃ¿ Like sparklÃ¨n weÃ¤ves in zunny MaÃ¿; But mid she still, vor all she's gone Vrom souls she now do smile upon, Show others they can vind woone jaÃ¿ To turn the hardest work to plaÃ¿. My MeÃ¤ry's smile, o' Morey's Mill, My rwose o' Mowy Lea. MEARY WEDDED. The zun can zink, the stars mid rise, An' woods be green to sheenÃ¨n skies; The cock mid crow to mornÃ¨n light, An' workvo'k zing to vallÃ¨n night; The birds mid whissle on the spraÃ¿, An' childern leÃ¤p in merry plaÃ¿, But our's is now a lifeless pleÃ¤ce, Vor we've a-lost a smilÃ¨n feÃ¤ceâ Young MeÃ¤ry MeÃ¤d o' merry mood, Vor she's a-woo'd, an' wedded. The dog that woonce wer glad to bear Her fondlÃ¨n vingers down his heÃ¤ir, Do leÃ¤n his head ageÃ¤n the vloor, To watch, wi' heavy eyes, the door; An' men she zent so happy hwome O' Zadurdays, do seem to come To door, wi' downcast hearts, to miss Wi' smiles below the clematis, Young MeÃ¤ry MeÃ¤d o' merry mood, Vor she's a-woo'd an' wedded When they do draw the evenÃ¨n blind, An' when the evenÃ¨n light's a-tin'd, The cheerless vire do drow a gleÃ¤re O' light ageÃ¤n her empty chair; An' wordless gaps do now meÃ¤ke thin Their talk where woonce her vaÃ¯ce come in. Zoo lwonesome is her empty pleÃ¤ce, An' blest the house that ha' the feÃ¤ce O' MeÃ¤ry MeÃ¤d o' merry mood, Now she's a-woo'd an' wedded. The day she left her father's he'th, Though sad, wer kept a day o' me'th, An' dry-wheel'd waggons' empty beds Wer left 'ithin the tree-screen'd sheds; An' all the hosses, at their eÃ¤se, Went snortÃ¨n up the flow'ry leÃ¤se, But woone, the smartest for the roÃ¤d, That pull'd away the dearest lwoadâ Young MeÃ¤ry MeÃ¤d o' merry mood, That wer a-woo'd an' wedded. THE STWONEN BWOY UPON THE PILLAR. Wi' smokeless tuns an' empty halls, An' moss a-clingÃ¨n to the walls, In ev'ry wind the lofty tow'rs Do teÃ¤ke the zun, an' bear the show'rs; An' there, 'ithin a geÃ¤t a-hung, But vasten'd up, an' never swung, Upon the pillar, all alwone, Do stan' the little bwoy o' stwone; 'S a poppy bud mid linger on, VorseÃ¤ken, when the wheat's a-gone. An' there, then, wi' his bow let slack, An' little quiver at his back, Drough het an' wet, the little chile Vrom day to day do stan' an' smile. When vu'st the light, a-risÃ¨n weak, At break o' day, do smite his cheÃ¤k, Or while, at noon, the leafy bough Do cast a sheÃ¤de a-thirt his brow, Or when at night the warm-breath'd cows Do sleep by moon-belighted boughs; An' there the while the rooks do bring Their scroff to build their nest in spring, Or zwallows in the zummer day Do cling their little huts o' clay, 'Ithin the raÃ¯nless sheÃ¤des, below The steadvast arches' mossy bow. Or when, in Fall, the woak do shed The leaves, a-wither'd, vrom his head, An' western win's, a-blowÃ¨n cool, Do dreve em out athirt the pool, Or Winter's clouds do gather dark An' wet, wi' raÃ¯n, the elem's bark, You'll zee his pretty smile betwixt His little sheÃ¤de-mark'd lips a-fix'd; As there his little sheÃ¤pe do bide Drough day an' night, an' time an' tide, An' never change his size or dress, Nor overgrow his prettiness. But, oh! thik child, that we do vind In childhood still, do call to mind A little bwoy a-call'd by death, Long years agoo, vrom our sad he'th; An' I, in thought, can zee en dim The seÃ¤me in feÃ¤ce, the seÃ¤me in lim'. My heÃ¤ir mid whiten as the snow, My limbs grow weak, my step wear slow, My droopÃ¨n head mid slowly vall Above the han'-staff's glossy ball, An' yeet, vor all a wid'nÃ¨n span Ov years, mid change a livÃ¨n man, My little child do still appear To me wi' all his childhood's gear, 'Ithout a beard upon his chin, 'Ithout a wrinkle in his skin, A-livÃ¨n on, a child the seÃ¤me In look, an' sheÃ¤pe, an' size, an' neÃ¤me. THE YOUNG THAT DIED IN BEAUTY. If souls should only sheen so bright In heaven as in e'thly light, An' nothÃ¨n better wer the ceÃ¤se, How comely still, in sheÃ¤pe an' feÃ¤ce, Would many reach thik happy pleÃ¤ce,â The hopeful souls that in their prime Ha' seem'd a-took avore their timeâ The young that died in beauty. But when woone's lim's ha' lost their strangth A-tweilÃ¨n drough a lifetime's langth, An' over cheÃ¤ks a-growÃ¨n wold The slowly-weÃ¤sten years ha' rolled The deep'nÃ¨n wrinkle's hollow vwold; When life is ripe, then death do call Vor less ov thought, than when do vall On young vo'ks in their beauty. But pinÃ¨n souls, wi' heads a-hung In heavy sorrow vor the young, The sister ov the brother dead, The father wi' a child a-vled, The husband when his bride ha' laid Her head at rest, noo mwore to turn, Have all a-vound the time to murn Vor youth that died in beauty. An' yeet the church, where praÃ¿er do rise Vrom thoughtvul souls, wi' downcast eyes, An' village greens, a-beÃ¤t half beÃ¤re By dancers that do meet, an' weÃ¤r Such merry looks at feÃ¤st an' feÃ¤ir, Do gather under leÃ¤test skies, Their bloomÃ¨n cheÃ¤ks an' sparklÃ¨n eyes, Though young ha' died in beauty. But still the dead shall mwore than keep The beauty ov their eÃ¤rly sleep; Where comely looks shall never weÃ¤r Uncomely, under tweil an' ceÃ¤re. The feÃ¤ir at death be always feÃ¤ir, Still feÃ¤ir to livers' thought an' love, An' feÃ¤irer still to God above, Than when they died in beauty. FAIR EMILY OV YARROW MILL. Dear Yarrowham' 'twer many miles Vrom thy green meÃ¤ds that, in my walk, I met a maÃ¯d wi' winnÃ¨n smiles, That talk'd as vo'k at hwome do talk; And who at last should she be vound, Of all the souls the sky do bound, But woone that trod at vu'st thy groun' Fair Emily of Yarrow Mill. But thy wold house an' elmy nook, An' wall-screen'd geÃ¤rden's mossy zides, Thy grassy meÃ¤ds an' zedgy brook, An' high-bank'd leÃ¤nes, wi' sheÃ¤dy rides, Wer all a-known to me by light Ov eÃ¤rly days, a-quench'd by night, Avore they met the younger zight Ov Emily ov Yarrow Mill. An' now my heart do leÃ¤p to think O' times that I've a-spent in plaÃ¿, Bezide thy river's rushy brink, Upon a deÃ¤izy bed o' MaÃ¿; I lov'd the friends thy land ha' bore, An' I do love the paths they wore, An' I do love thee all the mwore, Vor Emily ov Yarrow Mill. When bright above the e'th below The moon do spread abroad his light, An' aÃ¯r o' zummer nights do blow Athirt the vields in plaÃ¿some flight, 'Tis then delightsome under all The sheÃ¤des o' boughs by path or wall, But mwostly thine when they do vall On Emily ov Yarrow Mill. THE SCUD. Aye, aye, the leÃ¤ne wi' flow'ry zides A-kept so lew, by hazzle-wrides, Wi' beds o' greygles out in bloom, Below the timber's windless gloom, An' geÃ¤te that I've a-swung, An' rod as he's a-hung, When I wer young, in Woakley Coomb. 'Twer there at feÃ¤st we all did pass The evenÃ¨n on the leÃ¤nezide grass, Out where the geÃ¤te do let us drough, Below the woak-trees in the lew, In merry geÃ¤mes an' fun That meÃ¤de us skip an' run, Wi' burnÃ¨n zun, an' sky o' blue. But still there come a scud that drove The titt'rÃ¨n maÃ¯dens vrom the grove; An' there a-left wer flow'ry mound, 'Ithout a vaÃ¯ce, 'ithout a sound, Unless the aÃ¯r did blow, Drough ruslÃ¨n leaves, an' drow, The raÃ¯n drops low, upon the ground. I linger'd there an' miss'd the naÃ¯se; I linger'd there an' miss'd our jaÃ¿s; I miss'd woone soul beyond the rest; The maÃ¯d that I do like the best. Vor where her vaÃ¯ce is gaÃ¿ An' where her smiles do plaÃ¿, There's always jaÃ¿ vor ev'ry breast. Vor zome vo'k out abroad ha' me'th, But nwone at hwome bezide the he'th; An' zome ha' smiles vor strangers' view, An' frowns vor kith an' kin to rue; But her sweet vaÃ¯ce do vall, Wi' kindly words to all, Both big an' small, the whole day drough. An' when the evenÃ¨n sky wer peÃ¤le, We heÃ¤rd the warblÃ¨n nightÃ¨ngeÃ¤le, A-drawÃ¨n out his lwonesome zong, In windÃ¨n music down the drong; An' Jenny vrom her he'th, Come out, though not in me'th, But held her breath, to hear his zong. Then, while the bird wi' zingÃ¨n bill Did warble on, her vaÃ¯ce wer still; An' as she stood avore me, bound In stillness to the flow'ry mound, âThe bird's a jaÃ¿ to zome,â I thought, âbut when he's dum, Her vaÃ¯ce will come, wi' sweeter sound.â MINDEN HOUSE. 'Twer when the vo'k wer out to hawl A vield o' haÃ¿ a day in June, An' when the zun begun to vall Toward the west in afternoon, Woone only wer a-left behind To bide indoors, at hwome, an' mind The house, an' answer vo'k avore The geÃ¤te or door,âyoung Fanny DeÃ¤ne. The aÃ¯r 'ithin the geÃ¤rden wall Wer deadly still, unless the bee Did hummy by, or in the hall The clock did ring a-hettÃ¨n dree, An' there, wi' busy hands, inside The iron ceÃ¤sement, open'd wide, Did zit an' pull wi' nimble twitch Her tiny stitch, young Fanny DeÃ¤ne. As there she zot she heÃ¤rd two blows A-knock'd upon the rumblÃ¨n door, An' laid azide her work, an' rose, An' walk'd out feÃ¤ir, athirt the vloor; An' there, a-holdÃ¨n in his hand His bridled meÃ¤re, a youth did stand, An' mildly twold his neÃ¤me an' pleÃ¤ce Avore the feÃ¤ce o' Fanny DeÃ¤ne. He twold her that he had on hand Zome business on his father's zide, But what she didden understand; An' zoo she ax'd en if he'd ride Out where her father mid be vound, Bezide the plow, in Cowslip Ground; An' there he went, but left his mind Back there behind, wi' Fanny DeÃ¤ne. An' oh! his hwomeward road wer gaÃ¿ In aÃ¯r a-blowÃ¨n, whiff by whiff, While sheenÃ¨n water-weÃ¤ves did plaÃ¿ An' boughs did swaÃ¿ above the cliff; Vor Time had now a-show'd en dim The jaÃ¿ it had in store vor him; An' when he went thik road ageÃ¤n His errand then wer Fanny DeÃ¤ne. How strangely things be brought about By Providence, noo tongue can tell, She minded house, when vo'k wer out, An' zoo mus' bid the house farewell; The bees mid hum, the clock mid call The lwonesome hours 'ithin the hall, But in behind the woaken door, There's now noo mwore a Fanny DeÃ¤ne. THE LOVELY MAID OV ELWELL MEAD. A maÃ¯d wi' many gifts o' greÃ¤ce, A maÃ¯d wi' ever-smilÃ¨n feÃ¤ce, A child o' yours my chilhood's pleÃ¤ce, O leÃ¤nÃ¨n lawns ov Allen; 'S a-walkÃ¨n where your stream do flow, A-blushÃ¨n where your flowers do blow, A-smilÃ¨n where your zun do glow, O leÃ¤nÃ¨n lawns ov Allen. An' good, however good's a-waÃ¯gh'd, 'S the lovely maÃ¯d ov Elwell MeÃ¤d. An' oh! if I could teÃ¤me an' guide The winds above the e'th, an' ride As light as shootÃ¨n stars do glide, O leÃ¤nÃ¨n lawns ov Allen, To you I'd teÃ¤ke my daily flight, Drough dark'nÃ¨n aÃ¯r in evenÃ¨n's light, An' bid her every night âGood night,â O leÃ¤nÃ¨n lawns ov Allen. Vor good, however good's a-waÃ¯gh'd, 'S the lovely maÃ¯d ov Elwell MeÃ¤d. An' when your hedges' slooes be blue, Wi' blackberries o' dark'nÃ¨n hue, An' spiders' webs behung wi' dew, O leÃ¤nÃ¨n lawns ov Allen, Avore the winter aÃ¯r's a-chill'd, Avore your winter brook's a-vill'd, Avore your zummer flow'rs be kill'd, O leÃ¤nÃ¨n lawns ov Allen; I there would meet, in white arraÃ¿'d, The lovely maÃ¯d ov Elwell MeÃ¤d. For when the zun, as birds do rise, Do cast their sheÃ¤des vrom autum' skies, A-sparklÃ¨n in her dewy eyes, O leÃ¤nÃ¨n lawns ov Allen; Then all your mossy paths below The trees, wi' leaves a-vallÃ¨n slow, Like zinkÃ¨n fleÃ¤kes o' yollow snow, O leÃ¤nÃ¨n lawns ov Allen. Would be mwore teÃ¤kÃ¨n where there straÃ¿'d The lovely maÃ¯d ov Elwell MeÃ¤d. OUR FATHERS' WORKS. Ah! I do think, as I do tread TheÃ¤se path, wi' elems overhead, A-climÃ¨n slowly up vrom Bridge, By easy steps, to Broadwoak Ridge, That all theÃ¤se roads that we do bruise Wi' hosses' shoes, or heavy lwoads; An' hedges' bands, where trees in row Do rise an' grow aroun' the lands, Be works that we've a-vound a-wrought By our forefathers' ceÃ¤re an' thought. They clear'd the groun' vor grass to teÃ¤ke The pleÃ¤ce that bore the bremble breÃ¤ke, An' draÃ¯n'd the fen, where water spread, A-lyÃ¨n dead, a beÃ¤ne to men; An' built the mill, where still the wheel Do grind our meal, below the hill; An' turn'd the bridge, wi' arch a-spread, Below a road, vor us to tread. They vound a pleÃ¤ce, where we mid seek The gifts o' greÃ¤ce vrom week to week; An' built wi' stwone, upon the hill, A tow'r we still do call our own; With bells to use, an' meÃ¤ke rejaÃ¯ce, Wi' giant vaÃ¯ce, at our good news: An' lifted stwones an' beams to keep The raÃ¯n an' cwold vrom us asleep. Zoo now mid nwone ov us vorget The pattern our forefathers zet; But each be faÃ¯n to underteÃ¤ke Some work to meÃ¤ke vor others' gaÃ¯n, That we mid leÃ¤ve mwore good to sheÃ¤re, Less ills to bear, less souls to grieve, An' when our hands do vall to rest, It mid be vrom a work a-blest. THE WOLD VO'K DEAD. My days, wi' wold vo'k all but gone, An' childern now a-comÃ¨n on, Do bring me still my mother's smiles In light that now do show my chile's; An' I've a-sheÃ¤r'd the wold vo'ks' me'th, Avore the burnÃ¨n Chris'mas he'th, At friendly bwoards, where feÃ¤ce by feÃ¤ce, Did, year by year, gi'e up its pleÃ¤ce, An' leÃ¤ve me here, behind, to tread The ground a-trod by wold vo'k dead. But wold things be a-lost vor new, An' zome do come, while zome do goo: As wither'd beech-tree leaves do cling Among the nesh young buds o' spring; An' frettÃ¨n worms ha' slowly wound, Droo beams the wold vo'k lifted sound, An' trees they planted little slips Ha' stems that noo two eÃ¤rms can clips; An' grey an' yollow moss do spread On buildÃ¨ns new to wold vo'k dead. The backs of all our zilv'ry hills, The brook that still do dreve our mills, The roads a-climÃ¨n up the brows O' knaps, a-screen'd by meÃ¤ple boughs, Wer all a-mark'd in sheÃ¤de an' light Avore our wolder fathers' zight, In zunny days, a-gied their hands For happy work, a-tillÃ¨n lands, That now do yield their childern bread Till they do rest wi' wold vo'k dead. But livÃ¨n vo'k, a-grievÃ¨n on, Wi' lwonesome love, vor souls a-gone, Do zee their goodness, but do vind All else a-stealÃ¨n out o' mind; As air do meÃ¤ke the vurthest land Look feÃ¤irer than the vield at hand, An' zoo, as time do slowly pass, So still's a sheÃ¤de upon the grass, Its wid'nÃ¨n speÃ¤ce do slowly shed A glory roun' the wold vo'k dead. An' what if good vo'ks' life o' breath Is zoo a-hallow'd after death, That they mid only know above, Their times o' faÃ¯th, an' jaÃ¿, an' love, While all the evil time ha' brought 'S a-lost vor ever out o' thought; As all the moon that idden bright, 'S a-lost in darkness out o' zight; And all the godly life they led Is glory to the wold vo'k dead. If things be zoo, an' souls above Can only mind our e'thly love, Why then they'll veel our kindness drown The thoughts ov all that meÃ¤de em frown. An' jaÃ¿ o' jaÃ¿s will dry the tear O' sadness that do trickle here, An' nothÃ¨n mwore o' life than love, An' peace, will then be known above. Do good, vor that, when life's a-vled, Is still a pleasure to the dead. CULVER DELL AND THE SQUIRE. There's noo pleÃ¤ce I do like so well, As Elem Knap in Culver Dell, Where timber trees, wi' lofty shouds, Did rise avore the western clouds; An' stan' ageÃ¤n, wi' veathery tops, A-swaÃ¿en up in North-Hill Copse. An' on the east the mornÃ¨n broke Above a dewy grove o' woak; An' noontide shed its burnÃ¨n light On ashes on the southern height; An' I could vind zome teÃ¤les to tell, O' former days in Culver Dell. An' all the vo'k did love so well The good wold squire o' Culver Dell, That used to ramble drough the sheÃ¤des O' timber, or the burnÃ¨n gleÃ¤des, An' come at evenÃ¨n up the leÃ¤ze Wi' red-eÃ¤r'd dogs bezide his knees. An' hold his gun, a-hangÃ¨n drough His eÃ¤rmpit, out above his tooe. Wi' kindly words upon his tongue, Vor vo'k that met en, wold an' young, Vor he did know the poor so well 'S the richest vo'k in Culver Dell. An' while the woÃ¤k, wi' spreadÃ¨n head, Did sheÃ¤de the foxes' verny bed; An' runnÃ¨n heÃ¤res, in zunny gleÃ¤des, Did beÃ¤t the grasses' quiv'rÃ¨n' bleÃ¤des; An' speckled pa'tridges took flight In stubble vields a-feÃ¤dÃ¨n white; Or he could zee the pheasant strut In sheÃ¤dy woods, wi' paÃ¯nted cwoat; Or long-tongued dogs did love to run Among the leaves, bezide his gun; We didden want vor call to dwell At hwome in peace in Culver Dell. But now I hope his kindly feÃ¤ce Is gone to vind a better pleÃ¤ce; But still, wi' vo'k a-left behind He'll always be a-kept in mind, Vor all his springy-vooted hounds Ha' done o' trottÃ¨n round his grounds, An' we have all a-left the spot, To teÃ¤ke, a-scatter'd, each his lot; An' even Father, lik' the rest, Ha' left our long vorseÃ¤ken nest; An' we should vind it sad to dwell, AgeÃ¤n at hwome in Culver Dell. The aÃ¯ry mornÃ¨ns still mid smite Our windows wi' their rwosy light, An' high-zunn'd noons mid dry the dew On growÃ¨n groun' below our shoe; The blushÃ¨n evenÃ¨n still mid dye, Wi' viry red, the western sky; The zunny spring-time's quicknÃ¨n power Mid come to open leaf an' flower; An' days an' tides mid bring us on Woone pleasure when another's gone. But we must bid a long farewell To days an' tides in Culver Dell. OUR BETHPLACE. How dear's the door a latch do shut, An' geÃ¤rden that a hatch do shut, Where vu'st our bloomÃ¨n cheÃ¤ks ha' prest The pillor ov our childhood's rest; Or where, wi' little tooes, we wore The paths our fathers trod avore; Or clim'd the timber's bark aloft, Below the zingÃ¨n lark aloft, The while we heÃ¤rd the echo sound Drough all the ringÃ¨n valley round. A lwonesome grove o' woak did rise, To screen our house, where smoke did rise, A-twistÃ¨n blue, while yeet the zun Did langthen on our childhood's fun; An' there, wi' all the sheÃ¤pes an' sounds O' life, among the timber'd grounds, The birds upon their boughs did zing, An' milkmaÃ¯ds by their cows did zing, Wi' merry sounds, that softly died, A-ringÃ¨n down the valley zide. By river banks, wi' reeds a-bound, An' sheenÃ¨n pools, wi' weeds a-bound, The long-neck'd gander's ruddy bill To snow-white geese did cackle sh'ill; An' stridÃ¨n peewits heÃ¤sten'd by, O' tiptooe wi' their screamÃ¨n cry; An' stalkÃ¨n cows a lowÃ¨n loud, An' struttÃ¨n cocks a-crowÃ¨n loud, Did rouse the echoes up to mock Their mingled sounds by hill an' rock. The stars that clim'd our skies all dark, Above our sleepÃ¨n eyes all dark, An' zuns a-rollÃ¨n round to bring The seasons on, vrom spring to spring, Ha' vled, wi' never-restÃ¨n flight, Drough green-bough'd day, an' dark-tree'd night; Till now our childhood's pleÃ¤ces there, Be gaÃ¿ wi' other feÃ¤ces there, An' we ourselves do vollow on Our own forelivers dead an' gone. THE WINDOW FREAMED WI' STWONE. When Pentridge House wer still the nest O' souls that now ha' better rest, Avore the viÃ«r burnt to ground His beams an' walls, that then wer sound, 'Ithin a naÃ¯l-bestudded door, An' passage wi' a stwonÃ¨n vloor, There spread the hall, where zun-light shone In drough a window freÃ¤m'd wi' stwone. A clavy-beam o' sheenÃ¨n woak Did span the he'th wi' twistÃ¨n smoke, Where fleÃ¤mes did shoot in yollow streaks, Above the brands, their flashÃ¨n peaks; An' aunt did pull, as she did stand O'-tip-tooe, wi' her lifted hand, A curtain feÃ¤ded wi' the zun, Avore the window freÃ¤m'd wi' stwone. When Hwome-ground grass, below the moon, Wer damp wi' evenÃ¨n dew in June, An' aunt did call the maÃ¯dens in Vrom walkÃ¨n, wi' their shoes too thin, They zot to rest their litty veet Upon the window's woaken seat, An' chatted there, in light that shone In drough the window freÃ¤m'd wi' stwone. An' as the seasons, in a ring, Roll'd slowly roun' vrom spring to spring, An' brought em on zome holy-tide, When they did cast their tools azide; How glad it meÃ¤de em all to spy In Stwonylands their friends draw nigh, As they did know em all by neÃ¤me Out drough the window's stwonÃ¨n freÃ¤me. O evenÃ¨n zun, a-ridÃ¨n drough The sky, vrom Sh'oton Hill o' blue, To leÃ¤ve the night a-broodÃ¨n dark At Stalbridge, wi' its grey-wall'd park; Small jaÃ¿ to me the vields do bring, Vor all their zummer birds do zing, Since now thy beams noo mwore do fleÃ¤me In drough the window's stwonÃ¨n freÃ¤me. THE WATER-SPRING IN THE LEANE. Oh! aye! the spring 'ithin the leÃ¤ne, A-leÃ¤den down to Lyddan Brook; An' still a-nesslÃ¨n in his nook, As weeks do pass, an' moons do weÃ¤ne. Nwone the drier, Nwone the higher, Nwone the nigher to the door Where we did live so long avore. An' oh! what vo'k his mossy brim Ha' gathered in the run o' time! The wife a-blushÃ¨n in her prime; The widow wi' her eyezight dim; MaÃ¯dens dippÃ¨n, Childern sippÃ¨n, Water drippÃ¨n, at the cool Dark wallÃ¨n ov the little pool. Behind the spring do lie the lands My father till'd, vrom spring to spring, AwÃ¤itÃ¨n on vor time to bring The crops to paÃ¿ his weary hands. Wheat a-growÃ¨n, BeÃ¤ns a-blowÃ¨n, Grass vor mowÃ¨n, where the bridge Do leÃ¤d to Ryall's on the ridge. But who do know when liv'd an' died The squier o' the mwoldrÃ¨n hall; That lined en wi' a stwonÃ¨n wall, An' steÃ¤n'd so cleÃ¤n his wat'ry zide? We behind en, Now can't vind en, But do mind en, an' do thank His meÃ¤ker vor his little tank. THE POPLARS. If theÃ¤se day's work an' burnÃ¨n sky 'V'a-zent hwome you so tired as I, Let's zit an' rest 'ithin the screen O' my wold bow'r upon the green; Where I do goo myself an' let The evenÃ¨n aiÃ«r cool my het, When dew do wet the grasses bleÃ¤des, A-quiv'rÃ¨n in the dusky sheÃ¤des. There yonder poplar trees do play Soft music, as their heads do sway, While wind, a-rustlÃ¨n soft or loud, Do stream ageÃ¤n their lofty sh'oud; An' seem to heal the ranklÃ¨n zore My mind do meet wi' out o' door, When I've a-bore, in downcast mood, Zome evil where I look'd vor good. O' they two poplars that do rise So high avore our naÃ¯ghbours' eyes, A-zet by gramfer, hand by hand, Wi' grammer, in their bit o' land; The woone upon the western zide Wer his, an' woone wer grammer's pride, An' since they died, we all do teÃ¤ke Mwore ceÃ¤re o'm vor the wold vo'k's seÃ¤ke. An' there, wi' stems a-growÃ¨n tall Avore the houses mossy wall, The while the moon ha' slowly past The leafy window, they've a-cast Their sheÃ¤des 'ithin the window peÃ¤ne; While childern have a-grown to men, An' then ageÃ¤n ha' left their beds, To bear their childern's heavy heads. THE LINDEN ON THE LAWN. No! Jenny, there's noo pleÃ¤ce to charm My mind lik' yours at Woakland farm, A-peÃ¤rted vrom the busy town, By longsome miles ov aÃ¯ry down, Where woonce the meshy wall did gird Your flow'ry geÃ¤rden, an' the bird Did zing in zummer wind that stirr'd The spreÃ¤dÃ¨n linden on the lawn. An' now ov all the trees wi' sheÃ¤des A-wheelÃ¨n round in Blackmwore gleÃ¤des, There's noo tall poplar by the brook, Nor elem that do rock the rook, Nor ash upon the shelvÃ¨n ledge, Nor low-bough'd woak bezide the hedge, Nor withy up above the zedge, So dear's thik linden on the lawn. Vor there, o' zummer nights, below The wall, we zot when aÃ¯r did blow, An' sheÃ¤ke the dewy rwose a-tied Up roun' the window's stwonÃ¨n zide; An' while the carter rod' along A-zingÃ¨n, down the dusky drong, There you did zing a sweeter zong Below the linden on the lawn. An' while your warbled ditty wound Drough plaÃ¿some flights o' mellow sound, The nightÃ¨ngeÃ¤le's sh'ill zong, that broke The stillness ov the dewy woak, Rung clear along the grove, an' smote To sudden stillness ev'ry droat; As we did zit, an' hear it float Below the linden on the lawn. Where dusky light did softly vall 'Ithin the stwonÃ¨n-window'd hall, Avore your father's blinkÃ¨n eyes, His evenÃ¨n whiff o' smoke did rise, An' vrom the bedroom window's height Your little John, a-cloth'd in white, An' gwaÃ¯n to bed, did cry âgood nightâ Towards the linden on the lawn. But now, as Dobbin, wi' a nod Vor ev'ry heavy step he trod, Did bring me on, to-night, avore The geÃ¤bled house's pworchÃ¨d door, Noo laughÃ¨n child a-cloth'd in white, Look'd drough the stwonÃ¨n window's light, An' noo vaÃ¯ce zung, in dusky night, Below the linden on the lawn. An' zoo, if you should ever vind, My kindness seem to grow less kind, An' if upon my clouded feÃ¤ce My smile should yield a frown its pleÃ¤ce, Then, Jenny, only laugh an' call My mind 'ithin the geÃ¤rden wall, Where we did plaÃ¿ at even-fall, Below the linden on the lawn. OUR ABODE IN ARBY WOOD. Though ice do hang upon the willows Out bezide the vrozen brook, An' storms do roar above our pillows, Drough the night, 'ithin our nook; Our evenÃ¨n he'th's a-glowÃ¨n warm, Drough wringÃ¨n vrost, an' roarÃ¨n storm. Though winds mid meÃ¤ke the wold beams sheÃ¤ke, In our abode in Arby Wood. An' there, though we mid hear the timber Creake avore the windy raÃ¯n; An' climÃ¨n ivy quiver, limber, Up ageÃ¤n the window peÃ¤ne; Our merry vaÃ¯ces then do sound, In rollÃ¨n glee, or dree-vaÃ¯ce round; Though wind mid roar, 'ithout the door, Ov our abode in Arby Wood. THE VIER-ZIDE. 'Tis zome vo'ks jaÃ¿ to teÃ¤ke the road, An' goo abro'd, a-wand'rÃ¨n wide, Vrom shere to shere, vrom pleÃ¤ce to pleÃ¤ce, The swiftest peÃ¤ce that vo'k can ride. But I've a jaÃ¿ 'ithin the door, Wi' friends avore the vier-zide. An' zoo, when winter skies do lour, An' when the Stour's a-rollÃ¨n wide, Drough bridge-voot raÃ¯ls, a-paÃ¯nted white, To be at night, the trav'llers guide, Gi'e me a pleÃ¤ce that's warm an' dry, A-zittÃ¨n nigh my vier-zide. Vor where do love o' kith an' kin, At vu'st begin, or grow an' wride, Till souls a-lov'd so young, be wold, Though never cwold, drough time nor tide, But where in me'th their gather'd veet Do often meetâthe vier-zide. If, when a friend ha' left the land, I shook his hand a-most wet-eyed, I velt too well the op'nÃ¨n door Would leÃ¤d noo mwore where he did bide, An' where I heÃ¤rd his vaÃ¯ces sound, In me'th around the vier-zide. As I've a-zeed how vast do vall The mwold'rÃ¨n hall, the wold vo'ks pride, Where merry hearts wer woonce a-ved Wi' daily bread, why I've a-sigh'd, To zee the wall so green wi' mwold, An' vind so cwold the vier-zide. An' Chris'mas still mid bring his me'th To ouer he'th, but if we tried To gather all that woonce did wear Gay feÃ¤ces there! Ah! zome ha' died, An' zome be gone to leÃ¤ve wi' gaps O' missÃ¨n laps, the vier-zide. But come now, bring us in your hand, A heavy brand o' woak a-dried, To cheer us wi' his het an' light, While vrosty night, so starry-skied, Go gather souls that time do speÃ¤re To zit an' sheÃ¤re our vier-zide. KNOWLWOOD. I don't want to sleep abrode, John, I do like my hwomeward road, John; An' like the sound o' Knowlwood bells the best. Zome would rove vrom pleÃ¤ce to pleÃ¤ce, John, Zome would goo vrom feÃ¤ce to feÃ¤ce, John, But I be happy in my hwomely nest; An' slight's the hope vor any pleÃ¤ce bezide, To leÃ¤ve the plaÃ¯n abode where love do bide. Where the shelvÃ¨n knap do vall, John, Under trees a-springÃ¨n tall, John; 'Tis there my house do show his sheenÃ¨n zide, Wi' his walls vor ever green, John, Under ivy that's a screen, John, Vrom wet an' het, an' ev'ry changÃ¨n tide, An' I do little ho vor goold or pride, To leÃ¤ve the plaÃ¯n abode where love do bide. There the bendÃ¨n stream do flow, John, By the mossy bridge's bow, John; An' there the road do wind below the hill; There the miller, white wi' meal, John; Deafen'd wi' his foamy wheel, John, Do stan' o' times a-lookÃ¨n out o' mill: The while 'ithin his lightly-sheÃ¤kÃ¨n door, His wheatÃ¨n flour do whitÃ¨n all his floor. When my daily work's a-done, John, At the zettÃ¨n o' the zun, John, An' I all day 've a-plaÃ¿'d a good man's peÃ¤rt, I do vind my ease a-blest, John, While my conscience is at rest, John; An' while noo worm's a-left to fret my heart; An' who vor finer hwomes o' restless pride, Would pass the plaÃ¯n abode where peÃ¤ce do bide? By a windor in the west, John, There upon my fiddle's breast, John, The strings do sound below my bow's white heÃ¤ir; While a zingÃ¨n drush do swaÃ¿, John, Up an' down upon a spraÃ¿, John, An' cast his sheÃ¤de upon the window square; Vor birds do know their friends, an' build their nest, An' love to roost, where they can live at rest. Out o' town the win' do bring, John, Peals o' bells when they do ring, John, An' roun' me here, at hand, my ear can catch The maÃ¯d a-zingÃ¨n by the stream, John, Or carter whislÃ¨n wi' his team, John, Or zingÃ¨n birds, or water at the hatch; An' zoo wi' sounds o' vaÃ¯ce, an' bird an' bell, Noo hour is dull 'ithin our rwosy dell. An' when the darksome night do hide, John, Land an' wood on ev'ry zide, John; An' when the light's a-burnÃ¨n on my bwoard, Then vor pleasures out o' door, John, I've enough upon my vloor, John: My Jenny's lovÃ¨n deed, an' look, an' word, An' we be lwoth, lik' culvers zide by zide, To leÃ¤ve the plaÃ¯n abode where love do bide. HALLOWED PLEACES. At Woodcombe farm, wi' ground an' tree Hallow'd by times o' youthvul glee, At Chris'mas time I spent a night Wi' feÃ¤ces dearest to my zight; An' took my wife to tread, woonce mwore, Her maÃ¯den hwome's vorseÃ¤kÃ¨n vloor, An' under stars that slowly wheel'd Aloft, above the keen-aÃ¯r'd vield, While night bedimm'd the rus'lÃ¨n copse, An' darken'd all the ridges' tops, The hall, a-hung wi' holly, rung Wi' many a tongue o' wold an' young. There, on the he'th's well-hetted ground, Hallow'd by times o' zittÃ¨n round, The brimvul mug o' cider stood An' hiss'd avore the bleÃ¤zÃ¨n wood; An' zome, a-zittÃ¨n knee by knee, Did tell their teÃ¤les wi' hearty glee, An' others gamboll'd in a roar O' laughter on the stwonÃ¨n vloor; An' while the moss o' winter-tide Clung chilly roun' the house's zide, The hall, a-hung wi' holly, rung Wi' many a tongue o' wold an' young. There, on the pworches bench o' stwone, Hallow'd by times o' youthvul fun, We laugh'd an' sigh'd to think o' neÃ¤mes That rung there woonce, in evenÃ¨n geÃ¤mes; An' while the swaÃ¿Ã¨n cypress bow'd, In chilly wind, his darksome sh'oud An' honeyzuckles, beÃ¤re o' leÃ¤ves, Still reach'd the window-sheÃ¤dÃ¨n eaves Up where the clematis did trim The stwonÃ¨n arches mossy rim, The hall, a-hung wi' holly, rung Wi' many a tongue o' wold an' young. There, in the geÃ¤rden's wall-bound square, Hallow'd by times o' strollÃ¨n there, The winter wind, a-hufflÃ¨n loud, Did swaÃ¿ the pear-tree's leafless sh'oud, An' beÃ¤t the bush that woonce did bear The damask rwose vor Jenny's heÃ¤ir; An' there the walk o' peÃ¤vÃ¨n stwone That burn'd below the zummer zun, Struck icy-cwold drough shoes a-wore By maÃ¯dens vrom the hetted vloor In hall, a-hung wi' holm, where rung Vull many a tongue o' wold an' young. There at the geÃ¤te that woonce wer blue, Hallow'd by times o' passÃ¨n drough, Light strawmotes rose in flaggÃ¨n flight, A-floated by the winds o' night, Where leafy ivy-stems did crawl In moonlight on the windblown wall, An' merry maÃ¯dens' vaÃ¯ces vled In echoes sh'ill, vrom wall to shed, As shiv'rÃ¨n in their frocks o' white They come to bid us there âGood night,â Vrom hall, a-hung wi' holm, that rung Wi' many a tongue o' wold an' young. There in the narrow leÃ¤ne an' drong Hallow'd by times o' gwaÃ¯n along, The lofty ashes' leafless sh'ouds Rose dark avore the clear-edged clouds, The while the moon, at gertest height, Bespread the pooly brook wi' light, An' as our child, in loose-limb'd rest, Lay peÃ¤le upon her mother's breast, Her waxen eyelids seal'd her eyes Vrom darksome trees, an' sheenÃ¨n skies, An' halls a-hung wi' holm, that rung Wi' many a tongue, o' wold an' young. THE WOLD WALL. Here, JeÃ¤ne, we vu'st did meet below The leafy boughs, a-swingÃ¨n slow, Avore the zun, wi' evenÃ¨n glow, Above our road, a-beamÃ¨n red; The grass in zwath wer in the meÃ¤ds, The water gleam'd among the reeds In aÃ¯r a-steÃ¤lÃ¨n roun' the hall, Where ivy clung upon the wall. Ah! well-a-day! O wall adieu! The wall is wold, my grief is new. An' there you walk'd wi' blushÃ¨n pride, Where softly-wheelÃ¨n streams did glide, Drough sheÃ¤des o' poplars at my zide, An' there wi' love that still do live, Your feÃ¤ce did wear the smile o' youth, The while you spoke wi' age's truth, An' wi' a rwosebud's mossy ball, I deck'd your bosom vrom the wall. Ah! well-a-day! O wall adieu! The wall is wold, my grief is new. But now when winter's raÃ¯n do vall, An' wind do beÃ¤t ageÃ¤n the hall, The while upon the wat'ry wall In spots o' grey the moss do grow; The rwof noo mwore shall overspread The pillor ov our weary head, Nor shall the rwose's mossy ball Behang vor you the house's wall. Ah! well-a-day! O wall adieu! The wall is wold, my grief is new. BLEAKE'S HOUSE IN BLACKMWORE. John BleÃ¤ke he had a bit o' ground Come to en by his mother's zide; An' after that, two hunderd pound His uncle left en when he died; âWell now,â cried John, âit is my bent To build a house, an' paÃ¿ noo rent.â An' MeÃ¤ry gi'ed en her consent. âDo, do,ââthe maÃ¯dens cried. âTrue, true,ââhis wife replied. âDone, done,âa house o' brick or stwone,â Cried merry BleÃ¤ke o' Blackmwore. Then John he call'd vor men o' skill, An' builders answer'd to his call; An' met to reckon, each his bill; Vor vloor an' windor, rwof an' wall. An' woone did mark it on the groun', An' woone did think, an' scratch his crown, An' reckon work, an' write it down: âZoo, zoo,ââwoone treÃ¤desman cried, âTrue, true,ââwoone mwore replied. âAye, aye,ââgood work, an' have good paÃ¿,â Cried merry BleÃ¤ke o' Blackmwore. The work begun, an' trowels rung, An' up the brickÃ¨n wall did rise, An' up the slantÃ¨n refters sprung, Wi' busy blows, an' lusty cries; An' woone brought planks to meÃ¤ke a vloor, An' woone did come wi' durns or door, An' woone did zaw, an' woone did bore. âBrick, brick,âthere down below. Quick, quick,âwhy b'ye so slow?â âLime, lime,âwhy we do weÃ¤ste the time, Vor merry BleÃ¤ke o' Blackmwore.â The house wer up vrom groun' to tun, An' thatch'd ageÃ¤n the raÃ¯ny sky, Wi' windows to the noonday zun, Where rushy Stour do wander by. In coo'se he had a pworch to screen The inside door, when win's wer keen, An' out avore the pworch, a green. âHere! here!ââthe childern cried: âDear! dear!ââthe wife replied; âThere, there,âthe house is perty feÃ¤ir,â Cried merry BleÃ¤ke o' Blackmwore. Then John he ax'd his friends to warm His house, an' they, a goodish batch, Did come alwone, or eÃ¤rm in eÃ¤rm, All roads, a-meÃ¤kÃ¨n vor his hatch: An' there below the clavy beam The kettle-spout did zing an' steam; An' there wer ceÃ¤kes, an' tea wi' cream. âLo! lo!ââthe women cried; âHo! ho!ââthe men replied; âHealth, health,âattend ye wi' your wealth, Good merry BleÃ¤ke o' Blackmwore.â Then John, a-praÃ¯s'd, flung up his crown, All back a-laughÃ¨n in a roar. They praÃ¯s'd his wife, an' she look'd down A-simperÃ¨n towards the vloor. Then up they sprung a-dancÃ¨n reels, An' up went tooes, an' up went heels, A-windÃ¨n roun' in knots an' wheels. âBrisk, brisk,ââthe maÃ¯dens cried; âFrisk, frisk,ââthe men replied; âQuick, quick,âthere wi' your fiddle-stick,â Cried merry BleÃ¤ke o' Blackmwore. An' when the morrow's zun did sheen, John BleÃ¤ke beheld, wi' jaÃ¿ an' pride, His brickÃ¨n house, an' pworch, an' green, Above the Stour's rushy zide. The zwallows left the lwonesome groves, To build below the thatchÃ¨n oves, An' robins come vor crumbs o' lwoaves: âTweet, tweet,ââthe birds all cried; âSweet, sweet,ââJohn's wife replied; âDad, dad,ââthe childern cried so glad, To merry BleÃ¤ke o' Blackmwore. JOHN BLEAKE AT HWOME AT NIGHT. No: where the woak do overspread, The grass begloom'd below his head, An' water, under bowÃ¨n zedge, A-springÃ¨n vrom the river's edge, Do ripple, as the win' do blow, An' sparkle, as the sky do glow; An' grey-leav'd withy-boughs do cool, Wi' darksome sheÃ¤des, the clear-feÃ¤ced pool, My chimny smoke, 'ithin the lew O' trees is there arisÃ¨n blue; Avore the night do dim our zight, Or candle-light, a-sheenÃ¨n bright, Do sparkle drough the window. When crumpled leaves o' Fall do bound Avore the wind, along the ground, An' wither'd bennet-stems do stand A-quiv'rÃ¨n on the chilly land; The while the zun, wi' zettÃ¨n rim, Do leÃ¤ve the workman's pathway dim; An' sweet-breath'd childern's hangÃ¨n heads Be laid wi' kisses, on their beds; Then I do seek my woodland nest, An' zit bezide my vier at rest, While night's a-spread, where day's a-vled, An' lights do shed their beams o'red, A-sparklÃ¨n drough the window. If winter's whistlÃ¨n winds do vreeze The snow a-gather'd on the trees, An' sheÃ¤des o' poplar stems do vall In moonlight up athirt the wall; An' icicles do hang below The oves, a-glitt'rÃ¨n in a row, An' risÃ¨n stars do slowly ride Above the roof's upslantÃ¨n zide; Then I do lay my weary head Asleep upon my peaceful bed, When middle-night ha' quench'd the light Ov embers bright, an' candles white A-beamÃ¨n drough the window. MILKEN TIME. 'Twer when the busy birds did vlee, Wi' sheenÃ¨n wings, vrom tree to tree, To build upon the mossy lim,' Their hollow nestes' rounded rim; The while the zun, a-zinkÃ¨n low, Did roll along his evenÃ¨n bow, I come along where wide-horn'd cows, 'Ithin a nook, a-screen'd by boughs, Did stan' an' flip the white-hoop'd paÃ¯ls Wi' heÃ¤iry tufts o' swingÃ¨n taÃ¯ls; An' there wer Jenny Coom a-gone Along the path a vew steps on, A-beÃ¤rÃ¨n on her head, upstraÃ¯ght, Her paÃ¯l, wi' slowly-ridÃ¨n waÃ¯ght, An' hoops a-sheenÃ¨n, lily-white, AgeÃ¤n the evenÃ¨n's slantÃ¨n light; An' zo I took her paÃ¯l, an' left Her neck a-freed vrom all its heft; An' she a-lookÃ¨n up an' down, Wi' sheÃ¤ply head an' glossy crown, Then took my zide, an' kept my peÃ¤ce A-talkÃ¨n on wi' smilÃ¨n feÃ¤ce, An' zettÃ¨n things in sich a light, I'd faÃ¯n ha' heÃ¤r'd her talk all night; An' when I brought her milk avore The geÃ¤te, she took it in to door, An' if her paÃ¯l had but allow'd Her head to vall, she would ha' bow'd, An' still, as 'twer, I had the zight Ov her sweet smile droughout the night. WHEN BIRDS BE STILL. Vor all the zun do leÃ¤ve the sky, An' all the zounds o' day do die, An' noo mwore veet do walk the dim Vield-path to clim' the stiel's bars, Yet out below the rizÃ¨n stars, The dark'nÃ¨n day mid leÃ¤ve behind Woone tongue that I shall always vind, A-whisperÃ¨n kind, when birds be still. Zoo let the day come on to spread His kindly light above my head, Wi' zights to zee, an' sounds to hear, That still do cheer my thonghtvul mind; Or let en goo, an' leÃ¤ve behind An' hour to stroll along the gleÃ¤des, Where night do drown the beeches' sheÃ¤des, On grasses' bleÃ¤des, when birds be still. Vor when the night do lull the sound O' cows a-bleÃ¤rÃ¨n out in ground, The sh'ill-vaÃ¯c'd dog do stan' an' bark 'Ithin the dark, bezide the road; An' when noo cracklÃ¨n waggon's lwoad Is in the leÃ¤ne, the wind do bring The merry peals that bells do ring O ding-dong-ding, when birds be still. Zoo teÃ¤ke, vor me, the town a-drown'd, 'Ithin a storm o' rumblÃ¨n sound, An' gi'e me vaÃ¯ces that do speak So soft an' meek, to souls alwone; The brook a-gurglÃ¨n round a stwone, An' birds o' day a-zingÃ¨n clear, An' leaves, that I mid zit an' hear A-rustlÃ¨n near, when birds be still. RIDEN HWOME AT NIGHT. Oh! no, I quite injaÃ¿'d the ride Behind wold Dobbin's heavy heels, Wi' JeÃ¤ne a-prattlÃ¨n at my zide, Above our pair o' spinnÃ¨n wheels, As grey-rin'd ashes' swaÃ¿Ã¨n tops Did creak in moonlight in the copse, Above the quiv'rÃ¨n grass, a-beÃ¤t By wind a-blowÃ¨n drough the geÃ¤t. If weary souls did want their sleep, They had a-zent vor sleep the night; Vor vo'k that had a call to keep Awake, lik' us, there still wer light. An' He that shut the sleepers' eyes, A-waÃ¯tÃ¨n vor the zun to rise, Ha' too much love to let em know The ling'rÃ¨n night did goo so slow. But if my wife did catch a zight O' zome queer pollard, or a post, Poor soul! she took en in her fright To be a robber or a ghost. A two-stump'd withy, wi' a head, Mus' be a man wi' eÃ¤rms a-spread; An' foam o' water, round a rock, Wer then a drownÃ¨n leÃ¤dy's frock. Zome staddle stwones to bear a mow, Wer dancÃ¨n veÃ¤ries on the lag; An' then a snow-white sheeted cow Could only be, she thought, their flag, An owl a-vleÃ¨n drough the wood Wer men on watch vor little good; An' geÃ¤tes a slam'd by wind, did goo, She thought, to let a robber drough. But after all, she lik'd the zight O' cows asleep in glitt'rÃ¨n dew; An' brooks that gleam'd below the light, An' dim vield paths 'ithout a shoe. An' gaÃ¯ly talk'd bezide my ears, A-laughÃ¨n off her needless fears; Or had the childern uppermost In mind, instead o' thief or ghost. An' when our house, wi' open door, Did rumble hollow round our heads, She heÃ¤sten'd up to t'other vloor, To zee the childern in their beds; An' vound woone little head awry, Wi' woone a-turn'd toward the sky; An' wrung her hands ageÃ¤n her breast, A-smilÃ¨n at their happy rest. ZUN-ZET. Where the western zun, unclouded, Up above the grey hill-tops, Did sheen drough ashes, lofty sh'ouded. On the turf bezide the copse, In zummer weather, We together, Sorrow-slightÃ¨n, work-vorgettÃ¨n, Gambol'd wi' the zun a-zettÃ¨n. There, by flow'ry bows o' bramble, Under hedge, in ash-tree sheÃ¤des, The dun-heaÃ¯r'd ho'se did slowly ramble On the grasses' dewy bleÃ¤des, Zet free o' lwoads, An' stwony rwoads, Vorgetvul o' the lashes frettÃ¨n, GrazÃ¨n wi' the zun a-zettÃ¨n. There wer rooks a-beÃ¤tÃ¨n by us Drough the aÃ¯r, in a vlock, An' there the lively blackbird, nigh us, On the meÃ¤ple bough did rock, Wi' ringÃ¨n droat, Where zunlight smote The yollow boughs o' zunny hedges Over western hills' blue edges. Waters, drough the meÃ¤ds a-purlÃ¨n, Glissen'd in the evenÃ¨n's light, An' smoke, above the town a-curlÃ¨n, Melted slowly out o' zight; An' there, in glooms Ov unzunn'd rooms, To zome, wi' idle sorrows frettÃ¨n, Zuns did set avore their zettÃ¨n. We were out in geÃ¤mes and reÃ¤ces, Loud a-laughÃ¨n, wild in me'th, Wi' windblown heÃ¤ir, an' zunbrown'd feÃ¤ces, LeÃ¤pen on the high-sky'd e'th, Avore the lights Wer tin'd o' nights, An' while the gossamer's light nettÃ¨n Sparkled to the zun a-zettÃ¨n. SPRING. Now the zunny aÃ¯r's a-blowÃ¨n Softly over flowers a-growÃ¨n; An' the sparklÃ¨n light do quiver On the ivy-bough an' river; BleÃ¤tÃ¨n lambs, wi' woolly feÃ¤ces, Now do plaÃ¿, a-runnÃ¨n reÃ¤ces; An' the springÃ¨n Lark's a-zingÃ¨n, Lik' a dot avore the cloud, High above the ashes' shoud. HousÃ¨n, in the open brightness, Now do sheen in spots o' whiteness; Here an' there, on upland ledges, In among the trees an' hedges, Where, along by vlocks o' sparrows, Chatt'rÃ¨n at the ploughman's harrows, Dousty rwoaded, Errand-lwoaded; Jenny, though her cloak is thin, Do wish en hwome upon the pin. Zoo come along, noo longer heedvul Ov the viÃ«r, leÃ¤tely needvul, Over grass o' slopÃ¨n leÃ¤zes, ZingÃ¨n zongs in zunny breÃ¤zes; Out to work in copse, a-mootÃ¨n, Where the primrwose is a-shootÃ¨n, An' in gladness, Free o' sadness, In the warmth o' spring vorget Leafless winter's cwold an' wet. THE ZUMMER HEDGE. As light do gleÃ¤re in ev'ry ground, Wi' boughy hedges out a-round A-climmÃ¨n up the slopÃ¨n brows O' hills, in rows o' sheÃ¤dy boughs: The while the hawthorn buds do blow As thick as stars, an' white as snow; Or cream-white blossoms be a-spread About the guelder-rwoses' head; How cool's the sheÃ¤de, or warm's the lewth, Bezide a zummer hedge in blooth. When we've a-work'd drough longsome hours, Till dew's a-dried vrom dazzlÃ¨n flow'rs, The while the climmÃ¨n zun ha' glow'd Drough mwore than half his daily road: Then where the sheÃ¤des do slily pass Athirt our veet upon the grass, As we do rest by lofty ranks Ov elems on the flow'ry banks; How cool's the sheÃ¤de, or warm's the lewth, Bezide a zummer hedge in blooth. But oh! below woone hedge's zide Our jaÃ¿ do come a-most to pride; Out where the high-stemm'd trees do stand, In row bezide our own free land, An' where the wide-leav'd clote mid zwim 'Ithin our water's rushy rim: An' raÃ¯n do vall, an' zuns do burn, An' each in season, and in turn, To cool the sheÃ¤de or warm the lewth Ov our own zummer hedge in blooth. How soft do sheÃ¤ke the zummer hedgeâ How soft do sway the zummer zedgeâ How bright be zummer skies an' zunâ How bright the zummer brook do run; An' feÃ¤ir the flow'rs do bloom, to feÃ¤de Behind the swaÃ¿en mower's bleÃ¤de; An' sweet be merry looks o' jaÃ¿ By weÃ¤les an' pooks o' June's new haÃ¿, Wi' smilÃ¨n age, an' laughÃ¨n youth, Bezide the zummer hedge in blooth. THE WATER CROWVOOT. O' small-feÃ¤c'd flow'r that now dost bloom To stud wi' white the shallow Frome, An' leÃ¤ve the clote to spread his flow'r On darksome pools o' stwoneless Stour, When sof'ly-rizÃ¨n aÃ¯rs do cool The water in the sheenÃ¨n pool, Thy beds o' snow-white buds do gleam So feÃ¤ir upon the sky-blue stream, As whitest clouds, a-hangÃ¨n high Avore the blueness o' the sky; An' there, at hand, the thin-heÃ¤ir'd cows, In aÃ¯ry sheÃ¤des o' withy boughs, Or up bezide the mossy raÃ¯ls, Do stan' an' zwing their heavy taÃ¯ls, The while the ripplÃ¨n stream do flow Below the dousty bridge's bow; An' quiv'rÃ¨n water-gleams do mock The weÃ¤ves, upon the sheÃ¤ded rock; An' up athirt the copÃ¨n stwone The laÃ¯tren bwoy do leÃ¤n alwone, A-watchÃ¨n, wi' a stedvast look, The vallÃ¨n waters in the brook, The while the zand o' time do run An' leÃ¤ve his errand still undone. An' oh! as long's thy buds would gleam Above the softly-slidÃ¨n stream, While sparklÃ¨n zummer-brooks do run Below the lofty-climÃ¨n zun, I only wish that thou could'st staÃ¿ Vor noo man's harm, an' all men's jaÃ¿. But no, the waterman 'ull weÃ¤de Thy water wi' his deadly bleÃ¤de, To slaÃ¿ thee even in thy bloom, Fair small-feÃ¤ced flower o' the Frome. THE LILAC. Dear lilac-tree, a-spreadÃ¨n wide Thy purple blooth on ev'ry zide, As if the hollow sky did shed Its blue upon thy flow'ry head; Oh! whether I mid sheÃ¤re wi' thee Thy open aÃ¯r, my bloomÃ¨n tree, Or zee thy blossoms vrom the gloom, 'Ithin my zunless workÃ¨n-room, My heart do leÃ¤p, but leÃ¤p wi' sighs, At zight o' thee avore my eyes, For when thy greyblue head do swaÃ¿ In cloudless light, 'tis Spring, 'tis MaÃ¿. 'Tis Spring, 'tis MaÃ¿, as MaÃ¿ woonce shed His glowÃ¨n light above thy headâ When thy green boughs, wi' bloomy tips, Did sheÃ¤de my childern's laughÃ¨n lips; A-screenÃ¨n vrom the noonday gleÃ¤re Their rwosy cheÃ¤ks an' glossy heÃ¤ir; The while their mother's needle sped, Too quick vor zight, the snow-white thread, Unless her han', wi' lovÃ¨n ceÃ¤re, Did smooth their little heads o' heÃ¤ir; Or wi' a sheÃ¤ke, tie up anew Vor zome wild voot, a slippÃ¨n shoe; An' I did leÃ¤n bezide thy mound AgeÃ¤n the deÃ¤sy-dappled ground, The while the woaken clock did tick My hour o' rest away too quick, An' call me off to work anew, Wi' slowly-ringÃ¨n strokes, woone, two. Zoo let me zee noo darksome cloud Bedim to-day thy flow'ry sh'oud, But let en bloom on ev'ry spraÃ¿, Drough all the days o' zunny MaÃ¿. THE BLACKBIRD. 'Twer out at Penley I'd a-past A zummer day that went too vast, An' when the zettÃ¨n zun did spread On western clouds a vi'ry red; The elems' leafy limbs wer' still Above the gravel-bedded rill, An' under en did warble sh'ill, Avore the dusk, the blackbird. An' there, in sheÃ¤des o' darksome yews, Did vlee the maÃ¯dens on their tooes, A-laughÃ¨n sh'ill wi' merry feÃ¤ce When we did vind their hidÃ¨n pleÃ¤ce, 'Ithin the loose-bough'd ivy's gloom, Or lofty lilac, vull in bloom, Or hazzle-wrides that gi'ed em room Below the zingÃ¨n blackbird. Above our heads the rooks did vlee To reach their nested elem-tree, An' splashÃ¨n vish did rise to catch The wheelÃ¨n gnots above the hatch; An' there the miller went along, A-smilÃ¨n, up the sheÃ¤dy drong, But yeet too deaf to hear the zong A-zung us by the blackbird. An' there the sh'illy-bubblÃ¨n brook Did leÃ¤ve behind his rocky nook, To run drough meÃ¤ds a-chill'd wi' dew, Vrom hour to hour the whole night drough; But still his murmurs wer' a-drown'd By vaÃ¯ces that mid never sound AgeÃ¤n together on that ground, Wi' whislÃ¨ns o' the blackbird. THE SLANTEN LIGHT O' FALL. Ah! JeÃ¤ne, my maÃ¯d, I stood to you, When you wer' christen'd, small an' light, Wi' tiny eÃ¤rms o' red an' blue, A-hangÃ¨n in your robe o' white. We brought ye to the hallow'd stwone, Vor Christ to teÃ¤ke ye vor his own, When harvest work wer' all a-done, An' time brought round October zunâ The slantÃ¨n light o' Fall. An' I can mind the wind wer' rough, An' gather'd clouds, but brought noo storms, An' you did nessle warm enough, 'Ithin your smilÃ¨n mother's eÃ¤rms. The whindlÃ¨n grass did quiver light, Among the stubble, feÃ¤ded white, An' if at times the zunlight broke Upon the ground, or on the vo'k, 'Twer' slantÃ¨n light o' Fall. An' when we brought ye drough the door O' Knapton Church, a child o' greÃ¤ce, There cluster'd round a'most a score O' vo'k to zee your tiny feÃ¤ce. An' there we all did veel so proud, To zee an op'nÃ¨n in the cloud, An' then a stream o' light break drough, A-sheenÃ¨n brightly down on youâ The slantÃ¨n light o' Fall. But now your time's a-come to stand In church, a-blushÃ¨n at my zide, The while a bridegroom vrom my hand Ha' took ye vor his faÃ¯thvul bride. Your christÃ¨n neÃ¤me we gi'd ye here, When Fall did cool the weÃ¤stÃ¨n year; An' now, ageÃ¤n, we brought ye drough The doorway, wi' your surneÃ¤me new, In slantÃ¨n light o' Fall. An' zoo vur, JeÃ¤ne, your life is feÃ¤ir, An' God ha' been your steÃ¤dvast friend, An' mid ye have mwore jaÃ¿ than ceÃ¤re, Vor ever, till your journey's end. An' I've a-watch'd ye on wi' pride, But now I soon mus' leÃ¤ve your zide, Vor you ha' still life's spring-tide zun, But my life, JeÃ¤ne, is now a-run To slantÃ¨n light o' Fall. THISSLEDOWN. The thissledown by winds a-roll'd In Fall along the zunny plaÃ¯n, Did catch the grass, but lose its hold, Or cling to bennets, but in vaÃ¯n. But when it zwept along the grass, An' zunk below the hollow's edge, It lay at rest while winds did pass Above the pit-bescreenÃ¨n ledge. The plaÃ¯n ha' brightness wi' his strife, The pit is only dark at best, There's pleasure in a worksome life, An' sloth is tiresome wi' its rest. Zoo, then, I'd sooner beÃ¤r my peÃ¤rt, Ov all the trials vo'k do rue, Than have a deadness o' the heart, Wi' nothÃ¨n mwore to veel or do. THE MAY-TREE. I've a-come by the MaÃ¿-tree all times o' the year, When leaves wer a-springÃ¨n, When vrost wer a-stingÃ¨n, When cool-winded mornÃ¨n did show the hills clear, When night wer bedimmÃ¨n the vields vur an' near. When, in zummer, his head wer as white as a sheet, Wi' white buds a-zwellÃ¨n, An' blossom, sweet-smellÃ¨n, While leaves wi' green leaves on his boughzides did meet, A-sheÃ¤dÃ¨n the deÃ¤isies down under our veet. When the zun, in the Fall, wer a-wanderÃ¨n wan, An' haws on his head Did sprinkle en red, Or bright drops o' raÃ¯n wer a-hung loosely on, To the tips o' the sprigs when the scud wer a-gone. An' when, in the winter, the zun did goo low, An' keen win' did huffle, But never could ruffle The hard vrozen feÃ¤ce o' the water below, His limbs wer a-fringed wi' the vrost or the snow. LYDLINCH BELLS. When skies wer' peÃ¤le wi' twinklÃ¨n stars, An' whislÃ¨n aÃ¯r a-risÃ¨n keen; An' birds did leÃ¤ve the icy bars To vind, in woods, their mossy screen; When vrozen grass, as white's a sheet, Did scrunchy sharp below our veet, An' water, that did sparkle red At zunzet, wer' a-vrozen dead; The ringers then did spend an hour A-ringÃ¨n changes up in tow'r; Vor Lydlinch bells be good vor sound, An' liked by all the naÃ¯ghbours round. An' while along the leafless boughs O' ruslÃ¨n hedges, win's did pass, An' orts ov haÃ¿, a-left by cows, Did russle on the vrozen grass, An' maÃ¯dens' paÃ¯ls, wi' all their work A-done, did hang upon their vurk, An' they, avore the fleÃ¤mÃ¨n brand, Did teÃ¤ke their needle-work in hand, The men did cheer their heart an hour A-ringÃ¨n changes up in tow'r; Vor Lydlinch bells be good vor sound, An' liked by all the naÃ¯ghbours round. There sons did pull the bells that rung Their mother's weddÃ¨n peals avore, The while their fathers led em young An' blushÃ¨n vrom the churches door, An' still did cheem, wi' happy sound, As time did bring the Zundays round, An' call em to the holy pleÃ¤ce Vor heav'nly gifts o' peace an' greÃ¤ce; An' vo'k did come, a-streamÃ¨n slow Along below the trees in row, While they, in merry peals, did sound The bells vor all the naÃ¯ghbours round. An' when the bells, wi' changÃ¨n peal, Did smite their own vo'ks window-peÃ¤nes, Their sof'en'd sound did often steal Wi' west winds drough the Bagber leÃ¤nes; Or, as the win' did shift, mid goo Where woody Stock do nessle lew, Or where the risÃ¨n moon did light The walls o' Thornhill on the height; An' zoo, whatever time mid bring To meÃ¤ke their vive clear vaÃ¯ces zing, Still Lydlinch bells wer' good vor sound, An' liked by all the naÃ¯ghbours round. THE STAGE COACH. Ah! when the wold vo'k went abroad They thought it vast enough, If vow'r good hosses beÃ¤t the road Avore the coach's ruf; An' there they zot, A-cwold or hot, An' roll'd along the ground, While the whip did smack On the ho'ses' back, An' the wheels went swiftly round, Good so's; The wheels went swiftly round. Noo iron raÃ¯ls did streak the land To keep the wheels in track. The coachman turn'd his vow'r-in-hand, Out right, or left, an' back; An' he'd stop avore A man's own door, To teÃ¤ke en up or down: While the reÃ¯ns vell slack, On the ho'ses' back, Till the wheels did rottle round ageÃ¤n; Till the wheels did rottle round. An' there, when wintry win' did blow, Athirt the plaÃ¯n an' hill, An' the zun wer' peÃ¤le above the snow, An' ice did stop the mill, They did laugh an' joke Wi' cwoat or cloke, So warmly roun' em bound, While the whip did crack On the ho'ses' back, An' the wheels did trundle round, d'ye know; The wheels did trundle round. An' when the rumblÃ¨n coach did pass Where hufflÃ¨n winds did roar, They'd stop to teÃ¤ke a warmÃ¨n glass By the sign above the door; An' did laugh an' joke An' ax the vo'k The miles they wer vrom town, Till the whip did crack On the ho'ses' back, An' the wheels did truckle roun', good vo'k; The wheels did truckle roun'. An' gaÃ¯ly rod wold age or youth, When zummer light did vall On woods in leaf, or trees in blooth, Or girt vo'ks parkzide wall. An' they thought they past The pleÃ¤ces vast, Along the dousty groun', When the whip did smack On the ho'ses' back, An' the wheels spun swiftly roun'. Them days The wheels spun swiftly roun'. WAYFEAREN. The sky wer clear, the zunsheen glow'd On droopÃ¨n flowers drough the day, As I did beÃ¤t the dowsty road Vrom hinder hills, a-feÃ¤dÃ¨n gray; Drough hollows up the hills, Vrom knaps along by mills, Vrom mills by churches tow'rs, wi' bells That twold the hours to woody dells. An' when the windÃ¨n road do guide The thirsty vootman where mid flow The water vrom a rock bezide His vootsteps, in a sheenÃ¨n bow; The hand a-hollow'd up Do beÃ¤t a-goolden cup, To catch an' drink it, bright an' cool, A-vallÃ¨n light 'ithin the pool. Zoo when, at last, I hung my head Wi' thirsty lips a-burnÃ¨n dry, I come bezide a river-bed Where water flow'd so blue's the sky; An' there I meÃ¤de me up O' coltsvoot leaf a cup, Where water from his lip o' gray, Wer sweet to sip thik burnÃ¨n day. But when our work is right, a jaÃ¿ Do come to bless us in its traÃ¯n, An' hardships ha' zome good to paÃ¿ The thoughtvul soul vor all their pÃ¤in: The het do sweetÃ¨n sheÃ¤de, An' weÃ¤ry lim's ha' meÃ¤de A bed o' slumber, still an' sound, By woody hill or grassy mound. An' while I zot in sweet delaÃ¿ Below an elem on a hill, Where boughs a-halfwaÃ¿ up did swaÃ¿ In sheÃ¤des o' lim's above em still, An' blue sky show'd between The flutt'rÃ¨n leÃ¤ves o' green; I woulden gi'e that gloom an' sheÃ¤de Vor any room that weÃ¤lth ha' meÃ¤de. But oh! that vo'k that have the roads Where weary-vooted souls do pass, Would leÃ¤ve bezide the stwone vor lwoads, A little strip vor zummer grass; That when the stwones do bruise An' burn' an' gall our tooes, We then mid cool our veet on beds O' wild-thyme sweet, or deÃ¤isy-heads. THE LEANE. They do zay that a travellÃ¨n chap Have a-put in the newspeÃ¤per now, That the bit o' green ground on the knap Should be all a-took in vor the plough. He do fancy 'tis easy to show That we can be but stunpolls at best, Vor to leÃ¤ve a green spot where a flower can grow, Or a voot-weary walker mid rest. 'Tis hedge-grubbÃ¨n, Thomas, an' ledge-grubbÃ¨n, Never a-done While a sov'rÃ¨n mwore's to be won. The road, he do zay, is so wide As 'tis wanted vor travellers' wheels, As if all that did travel did ride, An' did never get galls on their heels. He would leÃ¤ve sich a thin strip o' groun', That, if a man's veet in his shoes Wer a-burnÃ¨n an' zore, why he coulden zit down But the wheels would run over his tooes. Vor 'tis meÃ¤ke money, Thomas, an' teÃ¤ke money, What's zwold an' bought Is all that is worthy o' thought. Years agoo the leÃ¤ne-zides did bear grass, Vor to pull wi' the geeses' red bills, That did hiss at the vo'k that did pass, Or the bwoys that pick'd up their white quills. But shortly, if vower or vive Ov our goslÃ¨ns do creep vrom the agg, They must mwope in the geÃ¤rden, mwore dead than alive, In a coop, or a-tied by the lag. Vor to catch at land, Thomas, an' snatch at land, Now is the plan; MeÃ¤ke money wherever you can. The childern wull soon have noo pleÃ¤ce Vor to plaÃ¿ in, an' if they do grow, They wull have a thin musheroom feÃ¤ce, Wi' their bodies so sumple as dough. But a man is a-meÃ¤de ov a child, An' his limbs do grow worksome by plaÃ¿; An' if the young child's little body's a-spweil'd, Why, the man's wull the sooner decaÃ¿. But wealth is wo'th now mwore than health is wo'th; Let it all goo, If't 'ull bring but a sov'rÃ¨n or two. Vor to breed the young fox or the heÃ¤re, We can gi'e up whole eÃ¤cres o' ground, But the greens be a-grudg'd, vor to rear Our young childern up healthy an' sound, Why, there woont be a-left the next age A green spot where their veet can goo free; An' the goocoo wull soon be committed to cage Vor a trespass in zomebody's tree. Vor 'tis lockÃ¨n up, Thomas, an' blockÃ¨n up, Stranger or brother, Men mussen come nigh woone another. Woone day I went in at a geÃ¤te, Wi' my child, where an echo did sound, An' the owner come up, an' did reÃ¤te Me as if I would car off his ground. But his vield an' the grass wer a-let, An' the damage that he could a-took Wer at mwost that the while I did open the geÃ¤te I did rub roun' the eye on the hook. But 'tis drevÃ¨n out, Thomas, an' hevÃ¨n out. Trample noo grounds, Unless you be a'ter the hounds. Ah! the SquiÃ«r o' Culver-dell Hall Wer' as diff'rent as light is vrom dark, Wi' zome vo'k that, as evenÃ¨n did vall, Had a-broke drough long grass in his park; Vor he went, wi' a smile, vor to meet Wi' the trespassers while they did pass, An' he zaid, âI do fear you'll catch cwold in your veet, You've a-walk'd drough so much o' my grass.â His mild words, Thomas, cut em like swords, Thomas, Newly a-whet, An' went vurder wi' them than a dret. THE RAILROAD. I took a flight, awhile agoo, Along the raÃ¯ls, a stage or two, An' while the heavy wheels did spin An' rottle, wi' a deafnÃ¨n din, In clouds o' steam, the zweepÃ¨n traÃ¯n Did shoot along the hill-bound plaÃ¯n, As sheÃ¤des o' birds in flight, do pass Below em on the zunny grass. An' as I zot, an' look'd abrode On leÃ¤nen land an' windÃ¨n road, The ground a-spread along our flight Did vlee behind us out o' zight; The while the zun, our heav'nly guide, Did ride on wi' us, zide by zide. An' zoo, while time, vrom stage to stage, Do car us on vrom youth to age, The e'thly pleasures we do vind Be soon a-met, an' left behind; But God, beholdÃ¨n vrom above Our lowly road, wi' yearnÃ¨n love, Do keep bezide us, stage by stage, Vrom be'th to youth, vrom youth to age. THE RAILROAD. An' while I went 'ithin a traÃ¯n, A-ridÃ¨n on athirt the plaÃ¯n, A-cleÃ¤rÃ¨n swifter than a hound, On twin-laid rails, the zwimmÃ¨n ground; I cast my eyes 'ithin a park, Upon a woak wi' grey-white bark, An' while I kept his head my mark, The rest did wheel around en. An' when in life our love do cling The clwosest round zome single thing, We then do vind that all the rest Do wheel roun' that, vor vu'st an' best; Zoo while our life do last, mid nought But what is good an' feÃ¤ir be sought, In word or deed, or heart or thought, An' all the rest wheel round it. SEATS. When starbright maÃ¯dens be to zit In silken frocks, that they do wear, The room mid have, as 'tis but fit, A han'some seat vor vo'k so feÃ¤ir; But we, in zundried vield an' wood, Ha' seats as good's a goolden chair. Vor here, 'ithin the woody drong, A ribbÃ¨d elem-stem do lie, A-vell'd in spring, an' stratch'd along A bed o' greygles up knee-high, A sheÃ¤dy seat to rest, an' let The burnÃ¨n het o' noon goo by. Or if you'd look, wi' wider scope, Out where the gray-tree'd plaÃ¯n do spread, The ash bezide the zunny slope, Do sheÃ¤de a cool-aÃ¯r'd deÃ¤isy bed, An' grassy seat, wi' spreadÃ¨n eaves O' rus'lÃ¨n leaves, above your head. An' there the traÃ¯n mid come in zight, Too vur to hear a-rollÃ¨n by, A-breathÃ¨n quick, in heÃ¤sty flight, His breath o' tweil, avore the sky, The while the waggon, wi' his lwoad, Do crawl the rwoad a-windÃ¨n nigh. Or now theÃ¤se happy holiday Do let vo'k rest their weÃ¤ry lim's, An' lwoaded haÃ¿'s a-hangÃ¨n gray, Above the waggon-wheels' dry rims, The meÃ¤d ha' seats in weÃ¤les or pooks, By windÃ¨n brooks, wi' crumblÃ¨n brims. Or if you'd gi'e your thoughtvul mind To yonder long-vorseÃ¤ken hall, Then teÃ¤ke a stwonÃ¨n seat behind The ivy on the broken wall, An' learn how e'thly wealth an' might Mid clim' their height, an' then mid vall. SOUND O' WATER. I born in town! oh no, my dawn O' life broke here beside theÃ¤se lawn; Not where pent aÃ¯r do roll along, In darkness drough the wall-bound drong, An' never bring the goo-coo's zong, Nor sweets o' blossoms in the hedge, Or bendÃ¨n rush, or sheenÃ¨n zedge, Or sounds o' flowÃ¨n water. The aÃ¯r that I've a-breath'd did sheÃ¤ke The draps o' raÃ¯n upon the breÃ¤ke, An' bear aloft the swingÃ¨n lark, An' huffle roun' the elem's bark, In boughy grove, an' woody park, An' brought us down the dewy dells, The high-wound zongs o' nightingeÃ¤les, An' sounds o' flowÃ¨n water. An' when the zun, wi' vi'ry rim, 'S a-zinkÃ¨n low, an' wearÃ¨n dim, Here I, a-most too tired to stand, Do leÃ¤ve my work that's under hand In pathless wood, or open land, To rest 'ithin my thatchÃ¨n oves, Wi' ruslÃ¨n win's in leafy groves, An' sounds o' flowÃ¨n water. TREES BE COMPANY. When zummer's burnÃ¨n het's a-shed Upon the droopÃ¨n grasses head, A-drevÃ¨n under sheÃ¤dy leaves The workvo'k in their snow-white sleeves, We then mid yearn to clim' the height, Where thorns be white, above the vern; An' aÃ¯r do turn the zunsheen's might To softer light too weak to burnâ On woodless downs we mid be free, But lowland trees be company. Though downs mid show a wider view O' green a-reachÃ¨n into blue Than roads a-windÃ¨n in the glen, An' ringÃ¨n wi' the sounds o' men; The thissle's crown o' red an' blue In Fall's cwold dew do wither brown, An' larks come down 'ithin the lew, As storms do brew, an' skies do frownâ An' though the down do let us free, The lowland trees be company. Where birds do zing, below the zun, In trees above the blue-smok'd tun, An' sheÃ¤des o' stems do overstratch The mossy path 'ithin the hatch; If leaves be bright up over head, When MaÃ¿ do shed its glitt'rÃ¨n light; Or, in the blight o' Fall, do spread A yollow bed avore our zightâ Whatever season it mid be, The trees be always company. When dusky night do nearly hide The path along the hedge's zide, An' dailight's hwomely sounds be still But sounds o' water at the mill; Then if noo feÃ¤ce we long'd to greet Could come to meet our lwonesome treÃ¤ce; Or if noo peÃ¤ce o' weary veet, However fleet, could reach its pleÃ¤ceâ However lwonesome we mid be, The trees would still be company. A PLEACE IN ZIGHT. As I at work do look aroun' Upon the groun' I have in view, To yonder hills that still do rise Avore the skies, wi' backs o' blue; 'Ithin the ridges that do vall An' rise roun' Blackmwore lik' a wall, 'Tis yonder knap do teÃ¤ke my zight Vrom dawn till night, the mwost ov all. An' there, in MaÃ¿, 'ithin the lewth O' boughs in blooth, be sheÃ¤dy walks, An' cowslips up in yollow beds Do hang their heads on downy stalks; An' if the weather should be feÃ¤ir When I've a holiday to speÃ¤re, I'll teÃ¤ke the chance o' gettÃ¨n drough An hour or two wi' zome vo'k there. An' there I now can dimly zee The elem-tree upon the mound, An' there meÃ¤ke out the high-bough'd grove An' narrow drove by Redcliff ground; An' there by trees a-risÃ¨n tall, The glowÃ¨n zunlight now do vall, Wi' shortest sheÃ¤des o' middle day, Upon the gray wold house's wall. An' I can zee avore the sky A-risÃ¨n high the churches speer, Wi' bells that I do goo to swing, An' like to ring, an' like to hear; An' if I've luck upon my zide, They bells shall sound bwoth loud an' wide, A peal above they slopes o' gray, Zome merry day wi' JeÃ¤ne a bride. GWAIN TO BROOKWELL. At Easter, though the wind wer high, We vound we had a zunny sky, An' zoo wold Dobbin had to trudge, His dowsty road by knap an' brudge, An' jog, wi' hangÃ¨n vetterlocks A-sheÃ¤kÃ¨n roun' his heavy hocks, An' us, a lwoad not much too small, A-ridÃ¨n out to Brookwell Hall; An' there in dowst vrom Dobbin's heels, An' green light-waggon's vower wheels, Our merry laughs did loudly sound, In rollÃ¨n winds athirt the ground; While sheenÃ¨n-ribbons' color'd streÃ¤ks Did flutter roun' the maÃ¯dens' cheÃ¤ks As they did zit, wi' smilÃ¨n lips, A-reachÃ¨n out their vinger-tips Toward zome teÃ¤kÃ¨n pleÃ¤ce or zight That they did shew us, left or right; An' woonce, when Jimmy tried to pleÃ¤ce A kiss on cousin Polly's feÃ¤ce, She push'd his hat, wi' wicked leers, Right off above his two red ears, An' there he roll'd along the groun' Wi' spreadÃ¨n brim an' rounded crown, An' vound, at last, a cowpon's brim, An' launch'd hizzelf, to te?ke a zwim; An' there, as Jim did run to catch His neÃ¤ked noddle's bit o' thatch, To zee his straÃ¯nÃ¨ns an' his strides, We laugh'd enough to split our zides. At Harwood Farm we pass'd the land That father's father had in hand, An' there, in open light did spread, The very groun's his cows did tread, An' there above the stwonÃ¨n tun Avore the dazzlÃ¨n mornÃ¨n zun, Wer' still the rollÃ¨n smoke, the breath A-breath'd vrom his wold house's he'th; An' there did lie below the door, The drashol' that his vootsteps wore; But there his meÃ¤te an' he bwoth died, Wi' hand in hand, an' zide by zide; Between the seÃ¤me two peals a-rung, Two Zundays, though they wer' but young, An' laid in sleep, their worksome hands, At rest vrom tweil wi' house or lands. Then vower childern laid their heads At night upon their little beds, An' never rose ageÃ¤n below A mother's love, or father's ho: Dree little maÃ¯dens, small in feÃ¤ce, An' woone small bwoy, the fourth in pleÃ¤ce. Zoo when their heedvul father died, He call'd his brother to his zide, To meÃ¤ke en stand, in hiz own stead, His childern's guide, when he wer dead; But still avore zix years brought round The woodland goo-coo's zummer sound, He weÃ¤sted all their little store, An' hardship drove em out o' door, To tweil till tweilsome life should end, 'Ithout a single e'thly friend. But soon wi' Harwood back behind, An' out o' zight an' out o' mind, We went a-rottlÃ¨n on, an' meÃ¤de Our way along to Brookwell SleÃ¤de; An' then we vound ourselves draw nigh The LeÃ¤dy's Tow'r that rose on high, An' seem'd a-comÃ¨n on to meet, Wi' growÃ¨n height, wold Dobbin's veet. BROOKWELL. Well, I do zay 'tis wo'th woone's while To beÃ¤t the doust a good six mile To zee the pleÃ¤ce the squier plann'd At Brookwell, now a-meÃ¤de by hand; Wi' open lawn, an' grove, an' pon', An' gravel-walks as cleÃ¤n as bron; An' grass a'most so soft to tread As velvet-pile o' silken thread; An' mounds wi' mÃ¦sh, an' rocks wi' flow'rs, An' ivy-sheÃ¤ded zummer bow'rs, An' dribblÃ¨n water down below The stwonÃ¨n archÃ¨s lofty bow. An' there do sound the watervall Below a cavern's mÃ¦shy wall, Where peÃ¤le-green light do struggle down A leafy crevice at the crown. An' there do gush the foamy bow O' water, white as driven snow; An' there, a zittÃ¨n all alwone, A little maÃ¯d o' marble stwone Do leÃ¤n her little cheÃ¤k azide Upon her lily han', an' bide Bezide the vallÃ¨n stream to zee Her pitcher vill'd avore her knee. An' then the brook, a-rollÃ¨n dark Below a leÃ¤nÃ¨n yew-tree's bark, Wi' plaÃ¿some ripples that do run A-flashÃ¨n to the western zun, Do shoot, at last, wi' foamy shocks, Athirt a ledge o' craggy rocks, A-castÃ¨n in his heÃ¤sty flight, Upon the stwones a robe o' white; An' then ageÃ¤n do goo an' vall Below a bridge's archÃ¨d wall, Where vo'k agwaÃ¯n athirt do pass Vow'r little bwoys a-cast in brass; An' woone do hold his angler's wand, Wi' steady hand, above the pond; An' woone, a-pweÃ¯ntÃ¨n to the stream His little vinger-tip, do seem A-showÃ¨n to his playmeÃ¤tes' eyes, Where he do zee the vishes rise; An' woone ageÃ¤n, wi' smilÃ¨n lips, Do put a vish his han' do clips 'Ithin a basket, loosely tied About his shoulder at his zide: An' after that the fourth do stand A-holdÃ¨n back his pretty hand Behind his little ear, to drow A stwone upon the stream below. An' then the housÃ¨n, that be all Sich pretty hwomes, vrom big to small, A-lookÃ¨n south, do cluster round A zunny ledge o' risÃ¨n ground, Avore a wood, a-nestled warm, In lewth ageÃ¤n the northern storm, Where smoke, a-wreathÃ¨n blue, do spread Above the tuns o' dusky red, An' window-peÃ¤nes do glitter bright Wi' burnÃ¨n streams o' zummer light, Below the vine, a-traÃ¯n'd to hem Their zides 'ithin his leafy stem, An' rangle on, wi' flutt'rÃ¨n leaves, Below the houses' thatchÃ¨n eaves. An' drough a lawn a-spread avore The windows, an' the pworchÃ¨d door, A path do wind 'ithin a hatch, A-vastÃ¨n'd wi' a clickÃ¨n latch, An' there up over roof an' tun, Do stan' the smooth-wall'd church o' stwone, Wi' carvÃ¨d windows, thin an' tall, A-reachÃ¨n up the lofty wall; An' battlements, a-stannÃ¨n round The tower, ninety veet vrom ground, Vrom where a teÃ¤p'rÃ¨n speer do spring As high's the mornÃ¨n lark do zing. Zoo I do zay 'tis wo'th woone's while To beÃ¤t the doust a good six mile, To zee the pleÃ¤ce the squier plann'd At Brookwell, now a-meÃ¤de by hand. THE SHY MAN. Ah! good MeÃ¤ster Gwillet, that you mid ha' know'd, Wer a-bred up at Coom, an' went little abroad; An' if he got in among strangers, he velt His poor heart in a twitter, an' ready to melt; Or if, by ill luck, in his rambles, he met Wi' zome maÃ¯dens a-titt'rÃ¨n, he burn'd wi' a het, That shot all drough the lim's o'n, an' left a cwold zweat, The poor little chap wer so shy, He wer ready to drap, an' to die. But at last 'twer' the lot o' the poor little man, To vall deeply in love, as the best ov us can; An' 'twer noo easy task vor a shy man to tell, Sich a dazzlÃ¨n feÃ¤ir maÃ¯d that he loved her so well; An' woone day when he met her, his knees nearly smote Woone another, an' then wi' a struggle he brote A vew vords to his tongue, wi' some mwore in his droat. But she, 'ithout doubt, could soon vind Vrom two words that come out, zix behind. Zoo at langth, when he vound her so smilÃ¨n an' kind, Why he wrote her zome laÃ¯ns, vor to tell her his mind, Though 'twer then a hard task vor a man that wer shy, To be married in church, wi' a crowd stannÃ¨n by. But he twold her woone day, âI have housen an' lands, We could marry by licence, if you don't like banns,â An' he cover'd his eyes up wi' woone ov his han's, Vor his head seem'd to zwim as he spoke, An' the aÃ¯r look'd so dim as a smoke. Well! he vound a good naÃ¯ghbour to goo in his pleÃ¤ce Vor to buy the goold ring, vor he hadden the feÃ¤ce. An' when he went up vor to put in the banns, He did sheÃ¤ke in his lags, an' did sheÃ¤ke in his han's. Then they ax'd vor her neÃ¤me, an' her parish or town, An' he gi'ed em a leaf, wi' her neÃ¤me a-wrote down; Vor he coulden ha' twold em outright, vor a poun' Vor his tongue wer so weak an' so loose, When he wanted to speak 'twer noo use. Zoo they went to be married, an' when they got there, All the vo'k wer a-gather'd as if 'twer a feÃ¤ir, An' he thought, though his pleÃ¤ce mid be pleasant to zome, He could all but ha' wish'd that he hadden a-come. The bride wer a-smilÃ¨n as fresh as a rwose, An' when he come wi' her, an' show'd his poor nose, All the little bwoys shouted, an' cried âThere he goes,â âThere he goes.â Oh! vor his peÃ¤rt he velt As if the poor heart o'n would melt. An' when they stood by the chancel together, Oh! a man mid ha' knock'd en right down wi' a veather, He did veel zoo asheÃ¤m'd that he thought he would rather He wÃ«rden the bridegroom, but only the father. But, though 'tis so funny to zee en so shy, Yet his mind is so lowly, his aÃ¯ms be so high, That to do a meÃ¤n deed, or to tell woone a lie, You'd vind that he'd shun mwore by half, Than to stan' vor vo'ks fun, or their laugh. THE WINTER'S WILLOW. There Liddy zot bezide her cow, Upon her lowly seat, O; A hood did overhang her brow, Her paÃ¯l wer at her veet, O; An' she wer kind, an' she wer feÃ¤ir, An' she wer young, an' free o' ceÃ¤re; Vew winters had a-blown her heÃ¤ir, Bezide the Winter's Willow. She idden woone a-rear'd in town, Where many a gaÃ¿er lass, O, Do trip a-smilÃ¨n up an' down, So peÃ¤le wi' smoke an' gas, O; But here, in vields o' greÃ¤zÃ¨n herds, Her vÃ¤ice ha' mingled sweetest words Wi' evenÃ¨n cheÃ¤rms o' busy birds, Bezide the Winter's Willow. An' when, at last, wi' beÃ¤tÃ¨n breast, I knock'd avore her door, O, She ax'd me in to teÃ¤ke the best O' pleÃ¤ces on the vloor, O; An' smilÃ¨n feÃ¤ir avore my zight, She blush'd bezide the yollow light O' bleÃ¤zÃ¨n brands, while winds o' night Did sheÃ¤ke the Winter's Willow. An' if there's readship in her smile, She don't begrudge to speÃ¤re, O, To zomebody, a little while, The empty woaken chair, O; An' if I've luck upon my zide, Why, I do think she'll be my bride Avore the leaves ha' twice a-died Upon the Winter's Willow. Above the coach-wheels' rollÃ¨n rims She never rose to ride, O, Though she do zet her comely lim's Above the mare's white zide, O; But don't become too proud to stoop An' scrub her milkÃ¨n-paÃ¯l's white hoop, Or zit a-milkÃ¨n where do droop, The wet-stemm'd Winter's Willow. An' I've a cow or two in leÃ¤ze, Along the river-zide, O, An' paÃ¯ls to zet avore her knees, At dawn, an' evenÃ¨n-tide, O; An' there she still mid zit, an' look Athirt upon the woody nook Where vu'st I zeed her by the brook Bezide the Winter's Willow. Zoo, who would heed the treeless down, A-beÃ¤t by all the storms, O, Or who would heed the busy town, Where vo'k do goo in zwarms, O, If he wer in my house below The elems, where the vire did glow In Liddy's feÃ¤ce, though winds did blow AgeÃ¤n the Winter's Willow. I KNOW WHO. Aye, aye, vull rathe the zun mus' rise To meÃ¤ke us tired o' zunny skies, A-sheenÃ¨n on the whole day drough, From mornÃ¨n's dawn till evenÃ¨n's dew. When trees be brown an' meÃ¤ds be green, An' skies be blue, an' streams do sheen, An' thin-edg'd clouds be snowy white Above the bluest hills in zight; But I can let the daylight goo, When I've a-met wi'âI know who. In spring I met her by a bed O' laurels higher than her head; The while a rwose hung white between Her blushes an' the laurel's green; An' then in fall, I went along The row of elems in the drong, An' heÃ¤rd her zing bezide the cows, By yollow leaves o' meÃ¤ple boughs; But fall or spring is feÃ¤ir to view When day do bring meâI know who. An' when, wi' wint'r a-comÃ¨n roun', The purple heath's a-feÃ¤dÃ¨n brown, An' hangÃ¨n vern's a-sheÃ¤kÃ¨n dead, Bezide the hill's besheÃ¤ded head: An' black-wing'd rooks do glitter bright Above my head, in peÃ¤ler light; Then though the birds do still the glee That sounded in the zummer tree, My heart is light the winter drough, In me'th at night, wi'âI know who. JESSIE LEE. Above the timber's bendÃ¨n sh'ouds, The western wind did softly blow; An' up avore the knap, the clouds Did ride as white as driven snow. Vrom west to east the clouds did zwim, Wi' wind that plied the elem's lim'; Vrom west to east the stream did glide, A-sheenÃ¨n wide, wi' windÃ¨n brim. How feÃ¤ir, I thought, avore the sky The slowly-zwimmÃ¨n clouds do look; How soft the win's a-streamÃ¨n by; How bright do roll the weÃ¤vy brook: When there, a-passÃ¨n on my right, A-walkÃ¨n slow, an' treadÃ¨n light, Young Jessie Lee come by, an' there Took all my ceÃ¤re, an' all my zight. Vor lovely wer the looks her feÃ¤ce Held up avore the western sky: An' comely wer the steps her peÃ¤ce Did meÃ¤ke a-walkÃ¨n slowly by: But I went east, wi' beÃ¤tÃ¨n breast, Wi' wind, an' cloud, an' brook, vor rest, Wi' rest a-lost, vor Jessie gone So lovely on, toward the west. Blow on, O winds, athirt the hill; Zwim on, O clouds; O waters vall, Down maeshy rocks, vrom mill to mill; I now can overlook ye all. But roll, O zun, an' bring to me My day, if such a day there be, When zome dear path to my abode Shall be the road o' Jessie Lee. TRUE LOVE. As evenÃ¨n aÃ¯r, in green-treed spring, Do sheÃ¤ke the new-sprung pa'sley bed, An' wither'd ash-tree keys do swing An' vall a-flutt'rÃ¨n roun' our head: There, while the birds do zing their zong In bushes down the ash-tree drong, Come Jessie Lee, vor sweet's the pleÃ¤ce Your vaÃ¯ce an' feÃ¤ce can meÃ¤ke vor me. Below the buddÃ¨n ashes' height We there can linger in the lew, While boughs, a-gilded by the light, Do sheen avore the sky o' blue: But there by zettÃ¨n zun, or moon A-risÃ¨n, time will vlee too soon Wi' Jessie Lee, vor sweet's the pleÃ¤ce Her vaÃ¯ce an' feÃ¤ce can meÃ¤ke vor me. Down where the darksome brook do flow, Below the bridge's archÃ¨d wall, Wi' alders dark, a-leÃ¤nÃ¨n low, Above the gloomy watervall; There I've a-led ye hwome at night, Wi' noo feÃ¤ce else 'ithin my zight But yours so feÃ¤ir, an' sweet's the pleÃ¤ce Your vaÃ¯ce an' feÃ¤ce ha' meÃ¤de me there. An' oh! when other years do come, An' zettÃ¨n zuns, wi' yollow gleÃ¤re, Drough western window-peÃ¤nes, at hwome, Do light upon my evenÃ¨n chair: While day do weÃ¤ne, an' dew do vall, Be wi' me then, or else in call, As time do vlee, vor sweet's the pleÃ¤ce Your vaÃ¯ce an' feÃ¤ce do meÃ¤ke vor me. Ah! you do smile, a-thinkÃ¨n light O' my true words, but never mind; Smile on, smile on, but still your flight Would leÃ¤ve me little jaÃ¿ behind: But let me not be zoo a-tried Wi' you a-lost where I do bide, O Jessie Lee, in any pleÃ¤ce Your vaÃ¯ce and feÃ¤ce ha' blest vor me. I'm sure that when a soul's a-brought To this our life ov aÃ¯r an' land, Woone mwore's a-mark'd in God's good thought, To help, wi' love, his heart an' hand. An' oh! if there should be in store An angel here vor my poor door, 'Tis Jessie Lee, vor sweet's the pleÃ¤ce Her vaÃ¯ce an' feÃ¤ce can meÃ¤ke vor me. THE BEAN VIELD. 'Twer' where the zun did warm the lewth, An' win' did whiver in the sheÃ¤de, The sweet-aÃ¯r'd beÃ¤ns were out in blooth, Down there 'ithin the elem gleÃ¤de; A yollow-banded bee did come, An' softly pitch, wi' hushÃ¨n hum, Upon a beÃ¤n, an' there did sip, Upon a swaÃ¿Ã¨n blossom's lip: An' there cried he, âAye, I can zee, This blossom's all a-zent vor me.â A-jilted up an' down, astride Upon a lofty ho'se a-trot, The meÃ¤ster then come by wi' pride, To zee the beÃ¤ns that he'd a-got; An' as he zot upon his hoss, The hoss ageÃ¤n did snort an' toss His high-ear'd head, an' at the zight Ov all the blossom, black an' white: âAh! ah!â thought he, the seÃ¤me's the bee, âTheÃ¤se beÃ¤ns be all a-zent vor me.â Zoo let the worold's riches breed A strife o' claÃ¯ms, wi' weak and strong, Vor now what cause have I to heed Who's in the right, or in the wrong; Since there do come drough yonder hatch, An' bloom below the house's thatch, The best o' maÃ¯dens, an' do own That she is mine, an' mine alwone: Zoo I can zee that love do gi'e The best ov all good gifts to me. Vor whose be all the crops an' land A-won an' lost, an' bought, an' zwold; Or whose, a-roll'd vrom hand to hand, The highest money that's a-twold? Vrom man to man a-passÃ¨n on, 'Tis here to-day, to-morrow gone. But there's a blessÃ¨n high above It allâa soul o' stedvast love: Zoo let it vlee, if God do gi'e Sweet Jessie vor a gift to me. WOLD FRIENDS A-MET. Aye, vull my heart's blood now do roll, An' gaÃ¿ do rise my happy soul, An' well they mid, vor here our veet Avore woone vier ageÃ¤n do meet; Vor you've avoun' my feÃ¤ce, to greet Wi' welcome words my startlÃ¨n ear. An' who be you, but John o' Weer, An' I, but William Wellburn. Here, light a candle up, to shed Mwore light upon a wold friend's head, An' show the smile, his feÃ¤ce woonce mwore Ha' brought us vrom another shore. An' I'll heave on a brand avore The vier-back, to meÃ¤ke good cheer, O' roarÃ¨n fleÃ¤mes, vor John o' Weer To chat wi' William Wellburn. Aye, aye, it mid be true that zome, When they do wander out vrom hwome, Do leÃ¤ve their nearest friends behind, Bwoth out o' zight, an' out o' mind; But John an' I ha' ties to bind Our souls together, vur or near, For, who is he but John o' Weer, An' I, but William Wellburn. Look, there he is, with twinklÃ¨n eyes, An' elbows down upon his thighs, A-chucklÃ¨n low, wi' merry grin. Though time ha' roughen'd up his chin, 'Tis still the seÃ¤me true soul 'ithin, As woonce I know'd, when year by year, Thik very chap, thik John o' Weer, Did plaÃ¿ wi' William Wellburn. Come, John, come; don't be dead-alive Here, reach us out your clust'r o' vive. Oh! you be happy. Yees, but that Woon't do till you can laugh an' chat. Don't blinky, lik' a purrÃ¨n cat, But leÃ¤p an' laugh, an' let vo'k hear What's happen'd, min, that John o' Weer Ha' met wi' William Wellburn. Vor zome, wi' selfishness too strong Vor love, do do each other wrong; An' zome do wrangle an' divide In hets ov anger, bred o' pride; But who do think that time or tide Can breed ill-will in friends so dear, As William wer to John o' Weer, An' John to William Wellburn? If other vo'ks do gleen to zee How lovÃ¨n an' how glad we be, What, then, poor souls, they had but vew Sich happy days, so long agoo, As they that I've a-spent wi' you; But they'd hold woone another dear, If woone o' them wer John o' Weer, An' t'other William Wellburn. FIFEHEAD. 'Twer where my fondest thoughts do light, At Fifehead, while we spent the night; The millwheel's restÃ¨n rim wer dry, An' houn's held up their evenÃ¨n cry; An' lofty, drough the midnight sky, Above the vo'k, wi' heavy heads, Asleep upon their darksome beds, The stars wer all awake, John. Noo birds o' day wer out to spread Their wings above the gully's bed, An' darkness roun' the elem-tree 'D a-still'd the charmy childern's glee. All he'ths wer' cwold but woone, where we Wer gaÃ¿, 'tis true, but gaÃ¿ an' wise, An' lÃ¤ugh'd in light o' maÃ¯den's eyes, That glissen'd wide awake, John. An' when we all, lik' loosen'd hounds, Broke out o' doors, wi' merry sounds, Our friends among the plaÃ¿some team, All brought us gwÃ¤in so vur's the stream, But JeÃ¤ne, that there, below a gleam O' light, watch'd woone o's out o' zight; Vor willÃ¨nly, vor his âGood night,â She'd longer bide awake, John. An' while up Leighs we stepp'd along Our grassy path, wi' joke an' zong, There Plumber, wi' its woody ground, O' slopÃ¨n knaps a-screen'd around, Rose dim 'ithout a breath o' sound, The wold abode o' squiers a-gone, Though while they lay a-sleepÃ¨n on, Their stars wer still awake, John. IVY HALL. If I've a-stream'd below a storm, An' not a-velt the raÃ¯n, An' if I ever velt me warm, In snow upon the plaÃ¯n, 'Twer when, as evenÃ¨n skies wer dim, An' vields below my eyes wer dim, I went alwone at evenÃ¨n-fall, Athirt the vields to Ivy Hall. I voun' the wind upon the hill, Last night, a-roarÃ¨n loud, An' rubbÃ¨n boughs a-creakÃ¨n shrill Upon the ashes' sh'oud; But oh! the reelÃ¨n copse mid groan, An' timber's lofty tops mid groan; The hufflÃ¨n winds be music all, Bezide my road to Ivy Hall. A sheÃ¤dy grove o' ribbÃ¨d woaks, Is Wootton's shelter'd nest, An' woaks do keep the winter's strokes Vrom Knapton's evenÃ¨n rest. An' woaks ageÃ¤n wi' bossy stems, An' elems wi' their mossy stems, Do rise to screen the leafy wall An' stwonÃ¨n roof ov Ivy Hall. The darksome clouds mid fling their sleet, An' vrost mid pinch me blue, Or snow mid cling below my veet, An' hide my road vrom view. The winter's only jaÃ¿ ov heart, An' storms do meÃ¤ke me gaÃ¿ ov heart, When I do rest, at evenÃ¨n-fall, Bezide the he'th ov Ivy Hall. There leafy stems do clim' around The mossy stwonÃ¨n eaves; An' there be window-zides a-bound Wi' quiv'rÃ¨n ivy-leaves. But though the sky is dim 'ithout, An' feÃ¤ces mid be grim 'ithout, Still I ha' smiles when I do call, At evenÃ¨n-tide, at Ivy Hall. FALSE FRIENDS-LIKE. When I wer' still a bwoy, an' mother's pride, A bigger bwoy spoke up to me so kind-like, âIf you do like, I'll treat ye wi' a ride In theÃ¤se wheel-barrow here.â Zoo I wer' blind-like To what he had a-workÃ¨n in his mind-like, An' mounted vor a passenger inside; An' comÃ¨n to a puddle, perty wide, He tipp'd me in, a-grinnÃ¨n back behind-like. Zoo when a man do come to me so thick-like, An' sheÃ¤ke my hand, where woonce he pass'd me by, An' tell me he would do me this or that, I can't help thinkÃ¨n o' the big bwoy's trick-like. An' then, vor all I can but wag my hat An' thank en, I do veel a little shy. THE BACHELOR. No! I don't begrudge en his life, Nor his goold, nor his housen, nor lands; TeÃ¤ke all o't, an' gi'e me my wife, A wife's be the cheapest ov hands. Lie alwone! sigh alwone! die alwone; Then be vorgot. No! I be content wi' my lot. Ah! where be the vingers so feÃ¤ir, Vor to pat en so soft on the feÃ¤ce, To mend ev'ry stitch that do tear, An' keep ev'ry button in pleÃ¤ce? Crack a-tore! brack a-tore! back a-tore! Buttons a-vled! Vor want ov a wife wi' her thread. Ah! where is the sweet-perty head That do nod till he's gone out o' zight? An' where be the white eÃ¤rms a-spread, To show en he's welcome at night? Dine alwone! pine alwone! whine alwone! Oh! what a life! I'll have a friend in a wife. An' when vrom a meetÃ¨n o' me'th Each husban' do leÃ¤d hwome his bride, Then he do slink hwome to his he'th, Wi' his eÃ¤rm a-hung down his cwold zide. SlinkÃ¨n on! blinkÃ¨n on! thinkÃ¨n on! Gloomy an' glum; NothÃ¨n but dullness to come. An' when he do onlock his door, Do rumble as hollow's a drum, An' the veÃ¤ries a-hid roun' the vloor, Do grin vor to zee en so glum. Keep alwone! sleep alwone! weep alwone! There let en bide, I'll have a wife at my zide. But when he's a-laid on his bed In a zickness, O, what wull he do! Vor the hands that would lift up his head, An' sheÃ¤ke up his pillor anew. Ills to come! pills to come! bills to come! Noo soul to sheÃ¤re The trials the poor wratch must bear. MARRIED PEAIR'S LOVE WALK. Come let's goo down the grove to-night; The moon is up, 'tis all so light As day, an' win' do blow enough To sheÃ¤ke the leaves, but tiddÃ¨n rough. Come, Esther, teÃ¤ke, vor wold time's seÃ¤ke, Your hooded cloke, that's on the pin, An' wrap up warm, an' teÃ¤ke my eÃ¤rm, You'll vind it better out than in. Come, Etty dear; come out o' door, An' teÃ¤ke a sweetheart's walk woonce mwore. How charmÃ¨n to our very souls, Wer' woonce your evenÃ¨n maÃ¯den strolls, The while the zettÃ¨n zunlight dyed Wi' red the beeches' western zide, But back avore your vinger wore The weddÃ¨n ring that's now so thin; An' you did sheÃ¤re a mother's ceÃ¤re, To watch an' call ye eÃ¤rly in. Come, Etty dear; come out o' door, An' teÃ¤ke a sweetheart's walk woonce mwore. An' then ageÃ¤n, when you could slight The clock a-strikÃ¨n leÃ¤te at night, The while the moon, wi' risÃ¨n rim, Did light the beeches' eastern lim.' When I'd a-bound your vinger round Wi' thik goold ring that's now so thin, An' you had nwone but me alwone To teÃ¤ke ye leÃ¤te or eÃ¤rly in. Come, Etty dear; come out o' door, An' teÃ¤ke a sweetheart's walk woonce mwore. But often when the western zide O' trees did glow at evenÃ¨n-tide, Or when the leÃ¤ter moon did light The beeches' eastern boughs at night, An' in the grove, where vo'k did rove The crumpled leaves did vlee an' spin, You couldÃ¨n sheÃ¤re the pleasure there: Your work or childern kept ye in. Come, Etty dear; come out o' door, An' teÃ¤ke a sweetheart's walk woonce mwore. But ceÃ¤res that zunk your oval chin AgeÃ¤n your bosom's lily skin, Vor all they meÃ¤de our life so black, Be now a-lost behind our back. Zoo never mwope, in midst of hope, To slight our blessÃ¨ns would be sin. Ha! ha! well done, now this is fun; When you do like I'll bring ye in. Here, Etty dear; here, out o' door, We'll teÃ¤ke a sweetheart's walk woonce mwore. A WIFE A-PRAISED. 'Twer MaÃ¿, but ev'ry leaf wer' dry All day below a sheenÃ¨n sky; The zun did glow wi' yollow gleÃ¤re, An' cowslips blow wi' yollow gleÃ¤re, Wi' greygles' bells a-droopÃ¨n low, An' bremble boughs a-stoopÃ¨n low; While culvers in the trees did coo Above the vallÃ¨n dew. An' there, wi' heÃ¤ir o' glossy black, Bezide your neck an' down your back, You rambled gaÃ¿ a-bloomÃ¨n feÃ¤ir; By boughs o' maÃ¿ a-bloomÃ¨n feÃ¤ir; An' while the birds did twitter nigh, An' water weÃ¤ves did glitter nigh, You gather'd cowslips in the lew, Below the vallÃ¨n dew. An' now, while you've a-been my bride As years o' flow'rs ha' bloom'd an' died, Your smilÃ¨n feÃ¤ce ha' been my jaÃ¿; Your soul o' greÃ¤ce ha' been my jaÃ¿; An' wi' my evenÃ¨n rest a-come, An' zunsheen to the west a-come, I'm glad to teÃ¤ke my road to you Vrom vields o' vallÃ¨n dew. An' when the raÃ¯n do wet the maÃ¿, A-bloomÃ¨n where we woonce did straÃ¿, An' win' do blow along so vast, An' streams do flow along so vast; AgeÃ¤n the storms so rough abroad, An' angry tongues so gruff abroad, The love that I do meet vrom you Is lik' the vallÃ¨n dew. An' you be sprack's a bee on wing, In search ov honey in the spring: The dawn-red sky do meet ye up; The birds vu'st cry do meet ye up; An' wi' your feÃ¤ce a-smilÃ¨n on, An' busy hands a-tweilÃ¨n on, You'll vind zome useful work to do Until the vallÃ¨n dew. THE WIFE A-LOST. Since I noo mwore do zee your feÃ¤ce, Up steÃ¤irs or down below, I'll zit me in the lwonesome pleÃ¤ce, Where flat-bough'd beech do grow: Below the beeches' bough, my love, Where you did never come, An' I don't look to meet ye now, As I do look at hwome. Since you noo mwore be at my zide, In walks in zummer het, I'll goo alwone where mist do ride, Drough trees a-drippÃ¨n wet: Below the raÃ¯n-wet bough, my love, Where you did never come, An' I don't grieve to miss ye now, As I do grieve at hwome. Since now bezide my dinner-bwoard Your vaÃ¯ce do never sound, I'll eat the bit I can avword, A-vield upon the ground; Below the darksome bough, my love, Where you did never dine, An' I don't grieve to miss ye now, As I at hwome do pine. Since I do miss your vaÃ¯ce an' feÃ¤ce In praÃ¿er at eventide, I'll praÃ¿ wi' woone sad vaÃ¯ce vor greÃ¤ce To goo where you do bide; Above the tree an' bough, my love, Where you be gone avore, An' be a-waÃ¯tÃ¨n vor me now, To come vor evermwore. THE THORNS IN THE GEATE. Ah! MeÃ¤ster Collins overtook Our knot o' vo'k a-stannÃ¨n still, Last Zunday, up on Ivy Hill, To zee how strong the corn did look. An' he staÃ¿'d back awhile an' spoke A vew kind words to all the vo'k, Vor good or joke, an' wi' a smile Begun a-plaÃ¿Ã¨n wi' a chile. The zull, wi' iron zide awry, Had long a-vurrow'd up the vield; The heavy roller had a-wheel'd It smooth vor showers vrom the sky; The bird-bwoy's cry, a-risÃ¨n shrill, An' clacker, had a-left the hill, All bright but still, vor time alwone To speed the work that we'd a-done. Down drough the wind, a-blowÃ¨n keen, Did gleÃ¤re the nearly cloudless sky, An' corn in bleÃ¤de, up ancle-high, 'Ithin the geÃ¤te did quiver green; An' in the geÃ¤te a-lock'd there stood A prickly row o' thornÃ¨n wood, Vor vo'k vor food had done their best, An' left to Spring to do the rest. âThe geÃ¤te,â he cried, âa-seal'd wi' thorn Vrom harmvul veet's a-left to hold The bleÃ¤de a-springÃ¨n vrom the mwold, While God do ripen it to corn. An' zoo in life let us vulvil Whatever is our MeÃ¤ker's will, An' then bide still, wi' peacevul breast, While He do manage all the rest. ANGELS BY THE DOOR. Oh! there be angels evermwore, A-passÃ¨n onward by the door, A-zent to teÃ¤ke our jaÃ¿s, or come To bring us zomeâO MeÃ¤rianne. Though doors be shut, an' bars be stout, Noo bolted door can keep em out; But they wull leÃ¤ve us ev'ry thing They have to bringâMy MeÃ¤rianne. An' zoo the days a-stealÃ¨n by, Wi' zuns a-ridÃ¨n drough the sky, Do bring us things to leÃ¤ve us sad, Or meÃ¤ke us gladâO MeÃ¤rianne. The day that's mild, the day that's stern, Do teÃ¤ke, in stillness, each his turn; An' evils at their worst mid mend, Or even endâMy MeÃ¤rianne. But still, if we can only bear Wi' faÃ¯th an' love, our paÃ¯n an' ceÃ¤re, We shan't vind missÃ¨n jaÃ¿s a-lost, Though we be crostâO MeÃ¤rianne. But all a-took to heav'n, an' stow'd Where we can't weÃ¤ste em on the road, As we do wander to an' fro, Down here belowâMy MeÃ¤rianne. But there be jaÃ¿s I'd soonest choose To keep, vrom them that I must lose; Your worksome hands to help my tweil, Your cheerful smileâO MeÃ¤rianne. The Zunday bells o' yonder tow'r, The moonlight sheÃ¤des o' my own bow'r, An' rest avore our vier-zide, At evenÃ¨n-tideâMy MeÃ¤rianne. VO'K A-COMEN INTO CHURCH. The church do seem a touchÃ¨n zight, When vo'k, a-comÃ¨n in at door, Do softly tread the long-aÃ¯l'd vloor Below the pillar'd arches' height, Wi' bells a-pealÃ¨n, Vo'k a-kneelÃ¨n, Hearts a-healÃ¨n, wi' the love An' peÃ¤ce a-zent em vrom above. An' there, wi' mild an' thoughtvul feÃ¤ce, Wi' downcast eyes, an' vaÃ¯ces dum', The wold an' young do slowly come, An' teÃ¤ke in stillness each his pleÃ¤ce, A-zinkÃ¨n slowly, KneelÃ¨n lowly, SeekÃ¨n holy thoughts alwone, In praÃ¿'r avore their MeÃ¤ker's throne. An' there be sons in youthvul pride, An' fathers weak wi' years an' paÃ¯n, An' daughters in their mother's traÃ¯n, The tall wi' smaller at their zide; Heads in murnÃ¨n Never turnÃ¨n, CheÃ¤ks a-burnÃ¨n, wi' the het O' youth, an' eyes noo tears do wet. There friends do settle, zide by zide, The knower speechless to the known; Their vaÃ¯ce is there vor God alwone; To flesh an' blood their tongues be tied. Grief a-wringÃ¨n, JaÃ¿ a-zingÃ¨n, PraÃ¿'r a-bringÃ¨n welcome rest So softly to the troubled breast. WOONE RULE. An' while I zot, wi' thoughtvul mind, Up where the lwonesome Coombs do wind, An' watch'd the little gully slide So crookÃ¨d to the river-zide; I thought how wrong the Stour did seem To roll along his ramblÃ¨n stream, A-runnÃ¨n wide the left o' south, To vind his mouth, the right-hand zide. But though his stream do teÃ¤ke, at mill, An eastward bend by Newton Hill, An' goo to lay his welcome boon O' daÃ¯ly water round Hammoon, An' then wind off ageÃ¤n, to run By Blanvord, to the noonday zun, 'Tis only bound by woone rule all, An' that's to vall down steepest ground. An' zoo, I thought, as we do bend Our waÃ¿ drough life, to reach our end, Our God ha' gi'ed us, vrom our youth, Woone rule to be our guideâHis truth. An' zoo wi' that, though we mid teÃ¤ke Wide rambles vor our callÃ¨ns' seÃ¤ke, What is, is best, we needen fear, An' we shall steer to happy rest. GOOD MEASTER COLLINS. Aye, Mr. Collins wer a-blest Wi' greÃ¤ce, an' now's a-gone to rest; An' though his heart did beÃ¤t so meek 'S a little child's, when he did speÃ¤k, The godly wisdom ov his tongue Wer dew o' greÃ¤ce to wold an' young. 'Twer woonce, upon a zummer's tide, I zot at Brookwell by his zide, Avore the leÃ¤ke, upon the rocks, Above the water's idle shocks, As little plaÃ¿some weÃ¤ves did zwim AgeÃ¤n the water's windy brim, Out where the lofty tower o' stwone Did stan' to years o' wind an' zun; An' where the zwellÃ¨n pillars bore A pworch above the heavy door, Wi' sister sheÃ¤des a-reachÃ¨n cool Athirt the stwones an' sparklÃ¨n pool. I spoke zome word that meÃ¤de en smile, O' girt vo'k's wealth an' poor vo'k's tweil, As if I pin'd, vor want ov greÃ¤ce, To have a lord's or squier's pleÃ¤ce. âNo, no,â he zaid, âwhat God do zend Is best vor all o's in the end, An' all that we do need the mwost Do come to us wi' leÃ¤st o' cost;â Why, who could live upon the e'th 'Ithout God's gÃ¯ft ov aÃ¯r vor breath? Or who could bide below the zun If water didden rise an' run? An' who could work below the skies If zun an' moon did never rise? Zoo aÃ¯r an' water, an' the light, Be higher gifts, a-reckon'd right, Than all the goold the darksome claÃ¿ Can ever yield to zunny daÃ¿: But then the aÃ¯r is roun' our heads, Abroad by day, or on our beds; Where land do gi'e us room to bide, Or seas do spread vor ships to ride; An' He do zend his waters free, Vrom clouds to lands, vrom lands to sea; An' mornÃ¨n light do blush an' glow, 'Ithout our tweilâ'ithout our ho. âZoo let us never pine, in sin, Vor gifts that be n't the best to win; The heaps o' goold that zome mid pile, Wi' sleepless nights an' peaceless tweil; Or manor that mid reach so wide As Blackmwore is vrom zide to zide, Or kingly swaÃ¿, wi' life or death, Vor helpless childern ov the e'th: Vor theÃ¤se be n't gifts, as He do know, That He in love should vu'st bestow; Or else we should have had our sheÃ¤re O'm all wi' little tweil or ceÃ¤re. âOv all His choicest gifts, His cry Is, âCome, ye moneyless, and buy.â Zoo blest is he that can but lift His praÃ¿er vor a happy gift.â HERRENSTON. Zoo then the leÃ¤dy an' the squier, At Christmas, gather'd gert an' small, Vor me'th, avore their roarÃ¨n vier, An' roun' their bwoard, 'ithin the hall; An' there, in glitt'rÃ¨n rows, between The roun'-rimm'd pleÃ¤tes, our knives did sheen, Wi' frothy eÃ¤le, an' cup, an' can, Vor maÃ¯d an' man, at Herrenston. An' there the jeints o' beef did stand, Lik' cliffs o' rock, in goodly row; Where woone mid quarry till his hand Did tire, an' meÃ¤ke but little show; An' a'ter we'd a-took our seat, An' greÃ¤ce had been a-zaid vor meat, We zet to work, an' zoo begun Our feÃ¤st an' fun at Herrenston. An' mothers there, bezide the bwoards, Wi' little childern in their laps, Did stoop, wi' lovÃ¨n looks an' words, An' veed em up wi' bits an' draps; An' smilÃ¨n husbands went in quest O' what their wives did like the best; An' you'd ha' zeed a happy zight, Thik merry night, at Herrenston. An' then the band, wi' each his leaf O' notes, above us at the zide, PlaÃ¿d up the praÃ¯se ov England's beef An' vill'd our hearts wi' English pride; An' leafy chaÃ¯ns o' garlands hung, Wi' dazzlÃ¨n stripes o' flags, that swung Above us, in a bleÃ¤ze o' light, Thik happy night, at Herrenston. An' then the clerk, avore the vÃ¯re, Begun to lead, wi' smilÃ¨n feÃ¤ce, A carol, wi' the Monkton quire, That rung drough all the crowded pleÃ¤ce. An' dins' o' words an' laughter broke In merry peals drough clouds o' smoke; Vor hardly wer there woone that spoke, But pass'd a joke, at Herrenston. Then man an' maÃ¯d stood up by twos, In rows, drough passage, out to door, An' gaÃ¯ly beÃ¤t, wi' nimble shoes, A dance upon the stwonÃ¨n floor. But who is worthy vor to tell, If she that then did bear the bell, Wer' woone o' Monkton, or o' CeÃ¤me, Or zome sweet neÃ¤me ov Herrenston. Zoo peace betide the gert vo'k's lands, When they can stoop, wi' kindly smile, An' teÃ¤ke a poor man by the hand, An' cheer en in his daily tweil. An' oh! mid He that's vur above The highest here, reward their love, An' gi'e their happy souls, drough greÃ¤ce, A higher pleÃ¤ce than Herrenston. OUT AT PLOUGH. Though cool avore the sheenÃ¨n sky Do vall the sheÃ¤des below the copse, The timber-trees, a-reachÃ¨n high, Ha' zunsheen on their lofty tops, Where yonder land's a-lyÃ¨n plow'd, An' red, below the snow-white cloud, An' vlocks o' pitchÃ¨n rooks do vwold Their wings to walk upon the mwold, While floods be low, An' buds do grow, An' aÃ¯r do blow, a-broad, O. But though the aÃ¯r is cwold below The creakÃ¨n copses' darksome screen, The truest sheÃ¤de do only show How strong the warmer zun do sheen; An' even times o' grief an' paÃ¯n, Ha' good a-comÃ¨n in their traÃ¯n, An' 'tis but happiness do mark The sheÃ¤des o' sorrow out so dark. As tweils be sad, Or smiles be glad, Or times be bad, at hwome, O. An' there the zunny land do lie Below the hangÃ¨n, in the lew, Wi' vurrows now a-crumblÃ¨n dry, Below the plowman's dousty shoe; An' there the bwoy do whissel sh'ill, Below the skylark's merry bill, Where primrwose beds do deck the zides O' banks below the meÃ¤ple wrides. As trees be bright Wi' bees in flight, An' weather's bright, abroad, O. An' there, as sheenÃ¨n wheels do spin Vull speed along the dousty rwoad, He can but stan', an' wish 'ithin His mind to be their happy lwoad, That he mid gaÃ¯ly ride, an' goo To towns the rwoad mid teÃ¤ke en drough, An' zee, for woonce, the zights behind The bluest hills his eyes can vind, O' towns, an' tow'rs, An' downs, an' flow'rs, In zunny hours, abroad, O. But still, vor all the weather's feÃ¤ir, Below a cloudless sky o' blue, The bwoy at plough do little ceÃ¤re How vast the brightest day mid goo; Vor he'd be glad to zee the zun A-zettÃ¨n, wi' his work a-done, That he, at hwome, mid still injaÃ¿ His happy bit ov evenÃ¨n plaÃ¿, So light's a lark Till night is dark, While dogs do bark, at hwome, O. THE BWOAT. Where cows did slowly seek the brink O' Stour, drough zunburnt grass, to drink; Wi' vishÃ¨n float, that there did zink An' rise, I zot as in a dream. The dazzlÃ¨n zun did cast his light On hedge-row blossom, snowy white, Though nothÃ¨n yet did come in zight, A-stirrÃ¨n on the straÃ¿Ã¨n stream; Till, out by sheÃ¤dy rocks there show'd, A bwoat along his foamy road, Wi' thik feÃ¤ir maÃ¯d at mill, a-row'd Wi' JeÃ¤ne behind her brother's oars. An' steÃ¤tely as a queen o' vo'k, She zot wi' floatÃ¨n scarlet cloak, An' comÃ¨n on, at ev'ry stroke, Between my withy-sheÃ¤ded shores. The broken stream did idly try To show her sheÃ¤pe a-ridÃ¨n by, The rushes brown-bloom'd stems did ply, As if they bow'd to her by will. The rings o' water, wi' a sock, Did break upon the mossy rock, An' gi'e my beÃ¤tÃ¨n heart a shock, Above my float's up-leÃ¤pÃ¨n quill. Then, like a cloud below the skies, A-drifted off, wi' less'nÃ¨n size, An' lost, she floated vrom my eyes, Where down below, the stream did wind; An' left the quiet weÃ¤ves woonce mwore, To zink to rest, a sky-blue'd vloor, Wi' all so still's the clote they bore, Aye, all but my own ruffled mind. THE PLEACE OUR OWN AGEAN. Well! thanks to you, my faÃ¯thful JeÃ¤ne, So worksome wi' your head an' hand, We seÃ¤ved enough to get ageÃ¤n My poor forefathers' plot o' land. 'Twer folly lost, an' cunnÃ¨n got, What should ha' come to me by lot. But let that goo; 'tis well the land Is come to hand, by be'th or not. An' there the brook, a-windÃ¨n round The parrick zide, do run below The grey-stwon'd bridge wi' gurglÃ¨n sound, A-sheÃ¤ded by the arches' bow; Where former days the wold brown meÃ¤re, Wi' father on her back, did wear Wi' heavy shoes the grav'ly leÃ¤ne, An' sheÃ¤ke her meÃ¤ne o' yollor heÃ¤ir. An' many zummers there ha' glow'd, To shrink the brook in bubblÃ¨n shoals, An' warm the doust upon the road, Below the trav'ller's burnÃ¨n zoles. An' zome ha' zent us to our bed In grief, an' zome in jaÃ¿ ha' vled; But vew ha' come wi' happier light Than what's now bright, above our head. The brook did peÃ¤rt, zome years agoo, Our Grenley meÃ¤ds vrom Knapton's Ridge; But now you know, between the two, A road's a-meÃ¤de by Grenley Bridge. Zoo why should we shrink back at zight Ov hindrances we ought to slight? A hearty will, wi' God our friend, Will gaÃ¯n its end, if 'tis but right. JOHN AN' THOMAS. Thomas. âHow b'ye, then, John, to-night; an' how Be times a-waggÃ¨n on w' ye now? I can't help slackenÃ¨n my peÃ¤ce When I do come along your pleÃ¤ce, To zee what crops your bit o' groun' Do bear ye all the zummer roun'. 'Tis true you don't get fruit nor blewth, 'Ithin the glassÃ¨n houses' lewth; But if a man can rear a crop Where win' do blow an' raÃ¯n can drop, Do seem to come, below your hand, As fine as any in the land. John. âWell, there, the geÃ¤rden stuff an' flow'rs Don't leave me many idle hours; But still, though I mid plant or zow, 'Tis Woone above do meÃ¤ke it grow. Thomas. Aye, aye, that's true, but still your strip O' groun' do show good workmanship: You've onions there nine inches round, An' turmits that would waÃ¯gh a pound; An' cabbage wi' its hard white head, An' teÃ¤ties in their dousty bed, An' carrots big an' straÃ¯ght enough Vor any show o' geÃ¤rden stuff; An' trees ov apples' red-skinn'd balls, An' purple plums upon the walls, An' peas an' beÃ¤ns; bezides a store O' heÃ¤rbs vor ev'ry paÃ¯n an' zore. John. âAn' over hedge the win's a-heÃ¤rd, A-ruslÃ¨n drough my barley's beard; An' swaÃ¿en wheat do overspread Zix ridges in a sheet o' red; An' then there's woone thing I do call The girtest handiness ov all: My ground is here at hand, avore My eyes, as I do stand at door; An' zoo I've never any need To goo a mile to pull a weed. Thomas. âNo, sure, a miÃ«l shoulden stratch Between woone's geÃ¤rden an' woone's hatch. A man would like his house to stand Bezide his little bit o' land. John. âYees. When woone's groun' vor geÃ¤rden stuff Is roun' below the house's ruf, Then woone can spend upon woone's land Odd minutes that mid lie on hand, The while, wi' night a-comÃ¨n on, The red west sky's a-wearÃ¨n wan; Or while woone's wife, wi' busy hands, Avore her vier o' burnÃ¨n brands, Do put, as best she can avword, Her bit o' dinner on the bwoard. An' here, when I do teÃ¤ke my road, At breakfast-time, agwaÃ¯n abrode, Why, I can zee if any plot O' groun' do want a hand or not; An' bid my childern, when there's need, To draw a reÃ¤ke or pull a weed, Or heal young beÃ¤ns or peas in line, Or tie em up wi' rods an' twine, Or peel a kindly withy white To hold a droopÃ¨n flow'r upright. Thomas. âNo. Bits o' time can zeldom come To much on groun' a mile vrom hwome A man at hwome should have in view The jobs his childern's hands can do; An' groun' abrode mid teÃ¤ke em all Beyond their mother's zight an' call, To get a zoakÃ¨n in a storm, Or vall, i' may be, into harm. John. âYees. GeÃ¤rden groun', as I've a-zed, Is better near woone's bwoard an' bed. PENTRIDGE BY THE RIVER. Pentridge!âoh! my heart's a-zwellÃ¨n Vull o' jaÃ¿ wi' vo'k a-tellÃ¨n Any news o' thik wold pleÃ¤ce, An' the boughy hedges round it, An' the river that do bound it Wi' his dark but glis'nÃ¨n feÃ¤ce. Vor there's noo land, on either hand, To me lik' Pentridge by the river. Be there any leaves to quiver On the aspen by the river? Doo he sheÃ¤de the water still, Where the rushes be a-growÃ¨n, Where the sullen Stour's a-flowÃ¨n Drough the meÃ¤ds vrom mill to mill? Vor if a tree wer dear to me, Oh! 'twer thik aspen by the river. There, in eegrass new a-shootÃ¨n, I did run on even vootÃ¨n, Happy, over new-mown land; Or did zing wi' zingÃ¨n drushes While I plaÃ¯ted, out o' rushes, Little baskets vor my hand; Bezide the clote that there did float, Wi' yollow blossoms, on the river. When the western zun's a-vallÃ¨n, What shrill vaÃ¯ce is now a-callÃ¨n Hwome the deÃ¤iry to the paÃ¯ls; Who do dreve em on, a-flingÃ¨n Wide-bow'd horns, or slowly zwingÃ¨n Right an' left their tufty taÃ¯ls? As they do goo a-huddled drough The geÃ¤te a-leÃ¤dÃ¨n up vrom river. BleÃ¤ded grass is now a-shootÃ¨n Where the vloor wer woonce our vootÃ¨n, While the hall wer still in pleÃ¤ce. Stwones be looser in the wallÃ¨n; Hollow trees be nearer vallÃ¨n; Ev'ry thing ha' chang'd its feÃ¤ce. But still the neÃ¤me do bide the seÃ¤meâ 'Tis PentridgeâPentridge by the river. WHEAT. In brown-leav'd Fall the wheat a-left 'Ithin its darksome bed, Where all the creakÃ¨n roller's heft Seal'd down its lowly head, Sprung sheÃ¤kÃ¨n drough the crumblÃ¨n mwold, Green-yollow, vrom below, An' bent its bleÃ¤des, a-glitt'rÃ¨n cwold, At last in winter snow. Zoo luck betide The upland zide, Where wheat do wride, In corn-vields wide, By crowns o' Dorset Downs, O. An' while the screamÃ¨n bird-bwoy shook Wi' little zun-burnt hand, His clacker at the bright-wing'd rook, About the zeeded land; His meÃ¤ster there did come an' stop His bridle-champÃ¨n meÃ¤re, Wi' thankvul heart, to zee his crop A-comÃ¨n up so feÃ¤ir. As there awhile By geÃ¤te or stile, He gi'ed the chile A cheerÃ¨n smile, By crowns o' Dorset Downs, O. At last, wi' eÃ¤rs o' darksome red, The yollow stalks did ply, A-swaÃ¿Ã¨n slow, so heavy's lead, In aÃ¯r a-blowÃ¨n by; An' then the busy reapers laid In row their russlÃ©n grips, An' sheÃ¤ves, a-leÃ¤nÃ¨n head by head, Did meÃ¤ke the stitches tips. Zoo food's a-vound, A-comÃ¨n round, Vrom zeed in ground, To sheaves a-bound, By crowns o' Dorset Downs, O. An' now the wheat, in lofty lwoads, Above the meÃ¤res' broad backs, Do ride along the cracklÃ¨n rwoads, Or dowsty waggon-tracks. An' there, mid every busy pick, Ha' work enough to do; An' where, avore, we built woone rick, Mid theÃ¤se year gi'e us two; Wi' God our friend, An' wealth to spend, Vor zome good end, That times mid mend, In towns, an' Dorset Downs, O. Zoo let the merry thatcher veel Fine weather on his brow, As he, in happy work, do kneel Up roun' the new-built mow, That now do zwell in sich a size, An' rise to sich a height, That, oh! the miller's wistful eyes Do sparkle at the zight. An' long mid stand, A happy band, To till the land, Wi' head an' hand, By crowns o' Dorset Downs, O. THE MEAD IN JUNE. Ah! how the looks o' sky an' ground Do change wi' months a-stealÃ¨n round, When northern winds, by starry night, Do stop in ice the river's flight; Or brooks in winter raÃ¯ns do zwell, Lik' rollÃ¨n seas athirt the dell; Or trickle thin in zummer tide; Among the mossy stwones half dried; But still, below the zun or moon, The feÃ¤rest vield's the meÃ¤d in June. An' I must own, my heart do beÃ¤t Wi' pride avore my own blue geÃ¤te, Where I can bid the steÃ¤tely tree Be cast, at langth, avore my knee; An' clover red, an' deÃ¤zies feaÃ¯r, An' gil'cups wi' their yollow gleÃ¤re, Be all a-match'd avore my zight By wheelÃ¨n buttervlees in flight, The while the burnÃ¨n zun at noon Do sheen upon my meÃ¤d in June. An' there do zing the swingÃ¨n lark So gaÃ¿'s above the finest park, An' day do sheÃ¤de my trees as true As any steÃ¤tely avenue; An' show'ry clouds o' spring do pass To shed their raÃ¯n on my young grass, An' aÃ¯r do blow the whole day long, To bring me breath, an' teÃ¤ke my zong, An' I do miss noo needvul boon A-gied to other meÃ¤ds in June. An' when the bloomÃ¨n rwose do ride Upon the boughy hedge's zide, We haymeÃ¤kers, in snow-white sleeves, Do work in sheÃ¤des o' quiv'rÃ¨n leaves, In afternoon, a-liftÃ¨n high Our reÃ¤kes avore the viery sky, A-reÃ¤ken up the haÃ¿ a-dried By day, in longsome weÃ¤les, to bide In chilly dew below the moon, O' shorten'd nights in zultry June. An' there the brook do softly flow Along, a-bendÃ¨n in a bow, An' vish, wi' zides o' zilver-white, Do flash vrom shoals a dazzlÃ¨n light; An' alders by the water's edge, Do sheÃ¤de the ribbon-bleÃ¤ded zedge; An' where, below the withy's head, The zwimmÃ¨n clote-leaves be a-spread, The angler is a-zot at noon Upon the flow'ry bank in June. Vor all the aiÃ«r that do bring My little meÃ¤d the breath o' spring, By day an' night's a-flowÃ¨n wide Above all other vields bezide; Vor all the zun above my ground 'S a-zent vor all the naÃ¯ghbours round, An' raÃ¯n do vall, an' streams do flow, Vor lands above, an' lands below, My bit o' meÃ¤d is God's own boon, To me alwone, vrom June to June. EARLY RISEN. The aÃ¯r to gi'e your cheÃ¤ks a hue O' rwosy red, so feaÃ¯r to view, Is what do sheÃ¤ke the grass-bleÃ¤des gray At breÃ¤k o' day, in mornÃ¨n dew; Vor vo'k that will be rathe abrode, Will meet wi' health upon their road. But bidÃ¨n up till dead o' night, When han's o' clocks do stan' upright, By candle-light, do soon consume The feÃ¤ce's bloom, an' turn it white. An' light a-cast vrom midnight skies Do blunt the sparklÃ¨n ov the eyes. Vor health do weÃ¤ke vrom nightly dreams Below the mornÃ¨n's eÃ¤rly beams, An' leÃ¤ve the dead-aÃ¯r'd houses' eaves, Vor quiv'rÃ¨n leaves, an' bubblÃ¨n streams, A-glitt'rÃ¨n brightly to the view, Below a sky o' cloudless blue. ZELLEN WOONE'S HONEY TO BUY ZOME'HAT SWEET. Why, his heart's lik' a popple, so hard as a stwone, Vor 'tis money, an' money's his ho, An' to handle an' reckon it up vor his own,, Is the best o' the jaÃ¿s he do know. Why, vor money he'd gi'e up his lags an' be leÃ¤me, Or would peÃ¤rt wi' his zight an' be blind, Or would lose vo'k's good will, vor to have a bad neÃ¤me, Or his peace, an' have trouble o' mind. But wi' ev'ry good thing that his meÃ¤nness mid bring, He'd paÃ¿ vor his money, An' only zell honey to buy zome'hat sweet. He did whisper to me, âYou do know that you stood By the Squier, wi' the vote that you had, You could ax en to help ye to zome'hat as good, Or to vind a good pleÃ¤ce vor your lad.â âAye, aye, but if I were beholdÃ¨n vor bread To another,â I zaid, âI should bind All my body an' soul to the nod of his head, An' gi'e up all my freedom o' mind.â An' then, if my paÃ¯n wer' a-zet wi' my gaÃ¯n, I should paÃ¿ vor my money, An' only zell honey to buy zome'hat sweet. Then, if my bit o' brook that do wind so vur round, Wer but his, why, he'd straÃ¯ghten his bed, An' the wold stunpole woak that do stan' in my ground, Shoudden long sheÃ¤de the grass wi' his head. But if I do vind jaÃ¿ where the leaves be a-shook On the limbs, wi' their sheÃ¤des on the grass, Or below, in the bow of the withy-bound nook, That the rock-washÃ¨n water do pass, Then wi' they jaÃ¿s a-vled an' zome goold in their stead, I should paÃ¿ vor my money, An' only zell honey to buy zome'hat sweet. No, be my lot good work, wi' the lungs well in plaÃ¿, An' good rest when the body do tire, Vor the mind a good conscience, wi' hope or wi' jaÃ¿, Vor the body, good lewth, an' good vire, There's noo good o' goold, but to buy what 'ull meÃ¤ke Vor our happiness here among men; An' who would gi'e happiness up vor the seÃ¤ke O' zome money to buy it ageÃ¤n? Vor twould seem to the eyes ov a man that is wise, Lik' money vor money, Or zellÃ¨n woone's honey to buy zome'hat sweet. DOBBIN DEAD. Thomas (1) an' John (2) a-ta'kÃ¨n o't. 2. I do veel vor ye, Thomas, vor I be a-feÃ¤r'd You've lost your wold meÃ¤re then, by what I've a-heÃ¤rd. 1. Yees, my meÃ¤re is a-gone, an' the cart's in the shed Wi' his wheelbonds a-rustÃ¨n, an' I'm out o' bread; Vor what be my han's vor to eÃ¤rn me a crowst, Wi' noo meÃ¤re's vower legs vor to trample the dowst. 2. Well, how did it happen? He vell vrom the brim Ov a cliff, as the teÃ¤le is, an' broke ev'ry lim'. 1. Why, I gi'ed en his run, an' he shook his wold meÃ¤ne, An' he rambled a-veedÃ¨n in Westergap LeÃ¤ne; An' there he must needs goo a-riggÃ¨n, an' crope Vor a vew bleÃ¤des o' grass up the wo'st o' the slope; Though I should ha' thought his wold head would ha' know'd That vor stiff lags, lik' his, the best pleÃ¤ce wer' the road. 2. An' you hadden a-kept en so short he must clim', Lik' a gwoat, vor a bleÃ¤de' at the risk ov a lim'. 1. No, but there, I'm a-twold, he did clim' an' did slide, An' did screÃ¤pe, an' did slip, on the shelvÃ¨n bank-zide, An' at langth lost his vootÃ¨n, an' roll'd vrom the top, Down, thump, kick, an' higgledly, piggledly, flop. 2. Dear me, that is bad! I do veel vor your loss, Vor a vew years agoo, Thomas, I lost my hoss. 1. How wer't? if I heÃ¤rd, I have now a-vorgot; Wer the poor thing bewitch'd, or a-pweison'd, or what? 2. He wer out, an' a-meÃ¤kÃ¨n his waÃ¿ to the brink O' the stream at the end o' Church LeÃ¤ne, vor to drink; An' he met wi' zome yew-twigs the men had a-cast Vrom the yew-tree, in churchyard, the road that he past. He wer pweison'd. (1) O dear, 'tis a hard loss to bear, Vor a tranter's whole bread is a-lost wi' his meÃ¤re; But ov all churches' yew-trees, I never zet eyes On a tree that would come up to thik woone vor size. 2. No, 'tis long years agone, but do linger as clear In my mind though as if I'd a-heÃ¤rd it to year. When King George wer in Dorset, an' show'd his round feÃ¤ce By our very own doors, at our very own pleÃ¤ce, That he look'd at thik yew-tree, an' nodded his head, An' he zaid,âan' I'll tell ye the words that he zaid:â âI'll be bound, if you'll search my dominions all drough, That you woon't vind the fellow to thik there wold yew.â HAPPINESS. Ah! you do seem to think the ground, Where happiness is best a-vound, Is where the high-peÃ¤l'd park do reach Wi' elem-rows, or clumps o' beech; Or where the coach do stand avore The twelve-tunn'd house's lofty door, Or men can ride behin' their hounds Vor miles athirt their own wide grounds, An' seldom wi' the lowly; Upon the green that we do tread, Below the welsh-nut's wide-limb'd head, Or grass where apple trees do spread? No, so's; no, no: not high nor low: 'Tis where the heart is holy. 'Tis true its veet mid tread the vloor, 'Ithin the marble-pillar'd door, Where day do cast, in high-roof'd halls, His light drough lofty window'd walls; An' wax-white han's do never tire Wi' strokes ov heavy work vor hire, An' all that money can avword Do lwoad the zilver-brighten'd bwoard; Or mid be wi' the lowly, Where turf's a-smwolderÃ¨n avore The back, to warm the stwonÃ¨n vloor, An' love's at hwome 'ithin the door? No, so's; no, no; not high nor low: 'Tis where the heart is holy. An' ceÃ¤re can come 'ithin a ring O' sworded guards, to smite a king, Though he mid hold 'ithin his hands The zwarmÃ¨n vo'k o' many lands; Or goo in drough the iron-geÃ¤te Avore the house o' lofty steÃ¤te; Or reach the miser that do smile A-buildÃ¨n up his goolden pile; Or else mid smite the lowly, That have noo pow'r to loose or bind Another's body, or his mind, But only hands to help mankind. If there is rest 'ithin the breast, 'Tis where the heart is holy. GRUFFMOODY GRIM. Aye, a sad life his wife must ha' led, Vor so snappish he's leÃ¤tely a-come, That there's nothÃ¨n but anger or dread Where he is, abroad or at hwome; He do wreak all his spite on the bwones O' whatever do vlee, or do crawl; He do quarrel wi' stocks, an' wi' stwones, An' the raÃ¯n, if do hold up or vall; There is nothÃ¨n vrom mornÃ¨n till night Do come right to Gruffmoody Grim. Woone night, in his anger, he zwore At the vier, that didden burn free: An' he het zome o't out on the vloor, Vor a vlanker it cast on his knee. Then he kicked it vor burnÃ¨n the child, An' het it among the cat's heaÃ¯rs; An' then beÃ¤t the cat, a-run wild, Wi' a spark on her back up the steaÃ¯rs; Vor even the vier an' fleÃ¤me Be to bleÃ¤me wi' Gruffmoody Grim. Then he snarl'd at the tea in his cup, Vor 'twer all a-got cwold in the pot, But 'twer woo'se when his wife vill'd it up Vrom the vire, vor 'twer then scaldÃ¨n hot; Then he growl'd that the bread wer sich st? As noo hammer in parish could crack, An' flung down the knife in a huff; Vor the edge o'n wer thicker'n the back. Vor beÃ¤kers an' meÃ¤kers o' tools Be all fools wi' Gruffmoody Grim, Oh! he's welcome, vor me, to breed dread Wherever his sheÃ¤de mid alight, An' to live wi' noo me'th round his head, An' noo feÃ¤ce wi' a smile in his zight; But let vo'k be all merry an' zing At the he'th where my own logs do burn, An' let anger's wild vist never swing In where I have a door on his durn; Vor I'll be a happier man, While I can, than Gruffmoody Grim. To zit down by the vier at night, Is my jaÃ¿âvor I woon't call it pride,â Wi' a brand on the bricks, all alight, An' a pile o' zome mwore at the zide. Then tell me o' zome'hat that's droll, An' I'll laugh till my two zides do eÃ¤che; Or o' naÃ¯ghbours in sorrow o' soul, An' I'll tweil all the night vor their seÃ¤ke; An' show that to teÃ¤ke things amiss Idden bliss, to Gruffmoody Grim. An' then let my child clim' my lag, An' I'll lift en, wi' love, to my chin; Or my maÃ¯d come an' coax me to bag Vor a frock, an' a frock she shall win; Or, then if my wife do meÃ¤ke light O' whatever the bwoys mid ha' broke, It wull seem but so small in my zight, A a leaf a-het down vrom a woak; An' not meÃ¤ke me ceÃ¤per an' froth Vull o' wrath, lik' Gruffmoody Grim. THE TURN O' THE DAYS. O, the wings o' the rook wer a-glitterÃ¨n bright, As he wheel'd on above, in the zun's evenÃ¨n light, An' noo snow wer a-left, but in patches o' white, On the hill at the turn o' the days. An' along on the slope wer the beÃ¤re-timber'd copse, Wi' the dry wood a-sheÃ¤kÃ¨n, wi' red-twiggÃ¨d tops. Vor the dry-flowÃ¨n wind, had a-blown off the drops O' the raÃ¯n, at the turn o' the days. There the stream did run on, in the sheÃ¤de o' the hill, So smooth in his flowÃ¨n, as if he stood still, An' bright wi' the skylight, did slide to the mill, By the meÃ¤ds, at the turn o' the days. An' up by the copse, down along the hill brow, Wer vurrows a-cut down, by men out at plough, So straÃ¯ght as the zunbeams, a-shot drough the bough O' the tree at the turn o' the days. Then the boomÃ¨n wold clock in the tower did mark His vive hours, avore the cool evenÃ¨n wer dark, An' ivy did glitter a-clung round the bark O' the tree, at the turn o' the days. An' womÃ¨n a-fraÃ¯d o' the road in the night, Wer a-heÃ¤stenÃ¨n on to reach hwome by the light, A-castÃ¨n long sheÃ¤des on the road, a-dried white, Down the hill, at the turn o' the days. The father an' mother did walk out to view The moss-bedded snow-drop, a-sprung in the lew, An' hear if the birds wer a-zingÃ¨n anew, In the boughs, at the turn o' the days. An' young vo'k a-laughÃ¨n wi' smooth glossy feÃ¤ce, Did hie over vields, wi' a light-vooted peÃ¤ce, To friends where the tow'r did betoken a pleÃ¤ce Among trees, at the turn o' the days. THE SPARROW CLUB. Last night the merry farmers' sons, Vrom biggest down to leÃ¤st, min, Gi'ed in the work of all their guns, An' had their sparrow feÃ¤st, min. An' who vor woone good merry soul Should goo to sheÃ¤re their me'th, min, But Gammon Gay, a chap so droll, He'd meÃ¤ke ye laugh to death, min. Vor heads o' sparrows they've a-shot They'll have a prize in cwein, min, That is, if they can meÃ¤ke their scot, Or else they'll pay a fine, min. An' all the money they can teÃ¤ke 'S a-gather'd up there-right, min, An' spent in meat an' drink, to meÃ¤ke A supper vor the night, min. Zoo when they took away the cloth, In middle of their din, min, An' cups o' eÃ¤le begun to froth, Below their merry chin, min. An' when the zong, by turn or chaÃ¯ce, Went roun' vrom tongue to tongue, min, Then Gammon pitch'd his merry vaÃ¯ce, An' here's the zong he zung, min. Zong. If you'll but let your clackers rest Vrom jabberÃ¨n an' hootÃ¨n, I'll teÃ¤ke my turn, an' do my best, To zing o' sparrow shootÃ¨n. Since every woone mus' pitch his key, An' zing a zong, in coo'se, lads, Why sparrow heads shall be to-day The heads o' my discoo'se, lads. We'll zend abroad our viery haÃ¯l Till ev'ry foe's a-vled, lads, An' though the rogues mid all turn taÃ¯l, We'll quickly show their head, lads. In corn, or out in open ground, In bush, or up in tree, lads, If we don't kill em, I'll be bound, We'll meÃ¤ke their veathers vlee, lads. Zoo let the belted spwortsmen brag When they've a-won a neÃ¤me, so's, That they do vind, or they do bag, Zoo many head o' geÃ¤me, so's: Vor when our cwein is woonce a-won, By heads o' sundry sizes, Why, who can slight what we've a-done? We've all a-won head prizes. Then teÃ¤ke a drap vor harmless fun, But not enough to quarrel; Though where a man do like the gun, He can't but need the barrel. O' goodly feÃ¤re, avore we'll start, We'll zit an' teÃ¤ke our vill, min; Our supper-bill can be but short, 'Tis but a sparrow-bill, min. GAMMONY GAY. Oh! thik Gammony Gay is so droll, That if he's at hwome by the he'th, Or wi' vo'k out o' door, he's the soul O' the meetÃ¨n vor antics an' me'th; He do cast off the thoughts ov ill luck As the water's a-shot vrom a duck; He do zing where his naÃ¯ghbours would cryâ He do laugh where the rest o's would sigh: Noo other's so merry o' feÃ¤ce, In the pleÃ¤ce, as Gammony Gay. An' o' workÃ¨n days, Oh! he do wear Such a funny roun' hat,âyou mid know'tâ Wi' a brim all a-strout roun' his heÃ¤ir, An' his glissenÃ¨n eyes down below't; An' a cwoat wi' broad skirts that do vlee In the wind ov his walk, round his knee; An' a peÃ¤ir o' gert pockets lik' bags, That do swing an' do bob at his lags: While me'th do walk out drough the pleÃ¤ce, In the feÃ¤ce o' Gammony Gay. An' if he do goo over groun' Wi' noo soul vor to greet wi' his words, The feÃ¤ce o'n do look up an' down, An' round en so quick as a bird's; An' if he do vall in wi' vo'k, Why, tidden vor want ov a joke, If he don't zend em on vrom the pleÃ¤ce Wi' a smile or a grin on their feÃ¤ce: An' the young wi' the wold have a-heÃ¤rd A kind word vrom Gammony Gay. An' when he do whissel or hum, 'Ithout thinkÃ¨n o' what he's a-doÃ¨n, He'll beÃ¤t his own lags vor a drum, An' bob his gaÃ¿ head to the tuÃ¨n; An' then you mid zee, 'etween whiles, His feÃ¤ce all alive wi' his smiles, An' his gaÃ¿-breathÃ¨n bozom do rise, An' his me'th do sheen out ov his eyes: An' at last to have praÃ¯se or have bleÃ¤me, Is the seÃ¤me to Gammony Gay. When he drove his wold cart out, an' broke The nut o' the wheel at a butt, There wer' âwoo'se things,â he cried, wi' a joke, âTo grieve at than crackÃ¨n a nut.â An' when he tipp'd over a lwoad Ov his reed-sheaves woone day on the rwoad, Then he spet in his han's, out o' sleeves, An' whissel'd, an' flung up his sheaves, As very vew others can wag, EÃ¤rm or lag, but Gammony Gay. He wer wi' us woone night when the band Wer a-come vor to gi'e us a hop, An' he pull'd Grammer out by the hand All down drough the dance vrom the top; An' Grammer did hobble an' squall, Wi' Gammon a-leÃ¤dÃ¨n the ball; While Gammon did sheÃ¤ke up his knee An' his voot, an' zing âDiddle-ee-dee!â An' we laugh'd ourzelves all out o' breath At the me'th o' Gammony Gay. When our tun wer' o' vier he rod Out to help us, an' meÃ¤de us sich fun, Vor he clomb up to dreve in a wad O' wet thorns, to the he'th, vrom the tun; An' there he did stamp wi' his voot, To push down the thorns an' the zoot, Till at last down the chimney's black wall Went the wad, an' poor Gammon an' all: An' seÃ¤fe on the he'th, wi' a grin On his chin pitch'd Gammony Gay. All the house-dogs do waggle their taÃ¯ls, If they do but catch zight ov his feÃ¤ce; An' the hosses do look over raÃ¯ls, An' do whicker to zee'n at the pleÃ¤ce; An' he'll always bestow a good word On a cat or a whisselÃ¨n bird; An' even if culvers do coo, Or an' owl is a-cryÃ¨n âHoo, hoo,â Where he is, there's always a joke To be spoke, by Gammony Gay. THE HEARE. (Dree o'm a-talkÃ¨n o't.) (1) There be the greyhounds! lok! an' there's the heÃ¤re! (2) What houn's, the squier's, Thomas? where, then, where? (1) Why, out in Ash Hill, near the barn, behind Thik tree. (3) The pollard? (1) Pollard! no, b'ye blind? (2) There, I do zee em over-right thik cow. (3) The red woone? (1) No, a mile beyand her now. (3) Oh! there's the heÃ¤re, a-meÃ¤kÃ¨n for the drong. (2) My goodness! How the dogs do zweep along, A-pokÃ¨n out their pweinted noses' tips. (3) He can't allow hizzuf much time vor slips! (1) They'll hab'en, after all, I'll bet a crown. (2) Done vor a crown. They woon't! He's gwÃ¤in to groun', (3) He is! (1) He idden! (3) Ah! 'tis well his tooes Ha' got noo corns, inside o' hobnaÃ¯l shoes. (1) He's geÃ¤me a-runnÃ¨n too. Why, he do mwore Than eÃ¤rn his life. (3) His life wer his avore. (1) There, now the dogs wull turn en. (2) No! He's right. (1) He idden! (2) Yes he is! (3) He's out o' zight. (1) Aye, aye. His mettle wull be well a-tried AgwaÃ¯n down Verny Hill, o' t'other zide. They'll have en there. (3) O! no, a vew good hops Wull teÃ¤ke en on to Knapton Lower Copse. (2) An' that's a meesh that he've a-took avore. (3) Yes, that's his hwome. (1) He'll never reach his door. (2) He wull. (1) He woont. (3) Now, hark, d'ye heÃ¤r em now? (2) O! here's a bwoy a-come athirt the brow O' Knapton Hill. We'll ax en. (1) Here, my bwoy! Can'st tell us where's the heÃ¤re? (4) He's got awoy. (2) Yes, got awoy, in coo'se, I never zeed A heÃ¤re a-scotÃ¨n on wi' half his speed. (1) Why, there, the dogs be wold, an' half a-done. They can't catch anything wi' lags to run. (2) Vrom vu'st to last they had but little chance O' catchÃ¨n o'n. (3) They had a perty dance. (1) No, catch en, no! I little thought they would; He know'd his road too well to Knapton Wood. (3) No! no! I wish the squier would let me feÃ¤re On rabbits till his hounds do catch thik heÃ¤re. NANNY GILL. Ah! they wer times, when Nanny Gill Went so'jerÃ¨n ageÃ¤nst her will, Back when the King come down to view His ho'se an' voot, in red an' blue, An' they did march in rows, An' wheel in lines an' bows, Below the King's own nose; An' guns did pwoint, an' swords did gleÃ¤re, A-fightÃ¨n foes that werden there. Poor Nanny Gill did goo to zell In town, her glitt'rÃ¨n macarel, A-pack'd wi' ceÃ¤re, in even lots, A-hossback in a peÃ¤ir o' pots. An' zoo when she did ride Between her panniers wide, Red-cloked in all her pride, Why, who but she, an' who but broke The road avore her scarlet cloke! But Nanny's hoss that she did ride, Woonce carr'd a sword ageÃ¤n his zide, An' had, to prick en into rank, A so'jer's spurs ageÃ¤n his flank; An' zoo, when he got zight O' swords a-gleamÃ¨n bright, An' men agwaÃ¯n to fight, He set his eyes athirt the ground, An' prick'd his ears to catch the sound. Then Nanny gi'ed his zide a kick, An' het en wi' her limber stick; But suddenly a horn did sound, An' zend the hossmen on vull bound; An' her hoss at the zight Went after em, vull flight, Wi' Nanny in a fright, A-pullÃ¨n, wi' a scream an' grin, Her wold brown raÃ¯ns to hold en in. But no! he went away vull bound, As vast as he could tear the ground, An' took, in line, a so'jer's pleÃ¤ce, Vor Nanny's cloke an' frighten'd feÃ¤ce; While vo'k did laugh an' shout To zee her cloke stream out, As she did wheel about, A-cryÃ¨n, âOh! la! dear!â in fright, The while her hoss did plaÃ¿ sham fight. MOONLIGHT ON THE DOOR. A-swaÃ¿Ã¨n slow, the poplar's head, Above the slopÃ¨n thatch did ply, The while the midnight moon did shed His light below the spangled sky. An' there the road did reach avore The hatch, all vootless down the hill; An' hands, a-tired by day, wer still, Wi' moonlight on the door. A-boomÃ¨n deep, did slowly sound The bell, a-tellÃ¨n middle night; The while the quiv'rÃ¨n ivy, round The tree, did sheÃ¤ke in softest light. But vootless wer the stwone avore The house where I, the maiden's guest, At evenÃ¨n, woonce did zit at rest By moonlight on the door. Though till the dawn, where night's a-meÃ¤de The day, the laughÃ¨n crowds be gaÃ¿, Let evenÃ¨n zink wi' quiet sheÃ¤de, Where I do hold my little swaÃ¿. An' childern dear to my heart's core, A-sleep wi' little heavÃ¨n breast, That pank'd by day in plaÃ¿, do rest Wi' moonlight on the door. But still 'tis good, woonce now an' then, To rove where moonlight on the land Do show in vaÃ¯n, vor heedless men, The road, the vield, the work in hand. When curtains be a-hung avore The glitt'rÃ¨n windows, snowy white, An' vine-leaf sheÃ¤des do sheÃ¤ke in light, O' moonlight on the door. MY LOVE'S GUARDIAN ANGEL. As in the cool-aÃ¯r'd road I come by, âin the night, Under the moon-clim'd height o' the sky, âin the night, There by the lime's broad lim's I did staÃ¿, While in the aÃ¯r dark sheÃ¤des wer' at plaÃ¿ Up on the window-glass that did keep Lew vrom the wind, my true-love asleep, âin the night. While in the gray-wall'd height o' the tow'r, âin the night, Sounded the midnight bell wi' the hour, âin the night, There come a bright-heÃ¤ir'd angel that shed Light vrom her white robe's zilvery thread, Wi' her vore-vinger held up to meÃ¤ke Silence around lest sleepers mid weÃ¤ke, âin the night. âOh! then,â I whisper'd, do I behold âin the night, Linda, my true-love, here in the cwold, âin the night?â âNo,â she meÃ¤de answer, âyou do misteÃ¤ke: She is asleep, but I that do weÃ¤ke, Here be on watch, an' angel a-blest, Over her slumber while she do rest, âin the night.â âZee how the winds, while brisk by the bough, âin the night, They do pass on, don't smite on her brow, in the night; Zee how the cloud-sheÃ¤des naÃ¯seless do zweep Over the house-top where she's asleep. You, too, goo by, though times mid be near, When you, wi' me, mid speÃ¤k to her ear âin the night. LEEBURN MILL. Ov all the meÃ¤ds wi' shoals an' pools, Where streams did sheÃ¤ke the limber zedge, An' milkÃ¨n vo'k did teÃ¤ke their stools, In evenÃ¨n zun-light under hedge: Ov all the wears the brooks did vill, Or all the hatches where a sheet O' foam did leÃ¤p below woone's veet, The pleÃ¤ce vor me wer Leeburn Mill. An' while below the mossy wheel All day the foamÃ¨n stream did roar, An' up in mill the floatÃ¨n meal Did pitch upon the sheÃ¤kÃ¨n vloor, We then could vind but vew han's still, Or veet a-restÃ¨n off the ground, An' seldom hear the merry sound O' geÃ¤mes a-plaÃ¿'d at Leeburn Mill. But when they let the stream goo free, Bezide the drippÃ¨n wheel at rest, An' leaves upon the poplar-tree Wer' dark avore the glowÃ¨n west; An' when the clock, a-ringÃ¨n sh'ill, Did slowly beÃ¤t zome evenÃ¨n hour, Oh! then 'ithin the leafy bow'r Our tongues did run at Leeburn Mill. An' when November's win' did blow, Wi' hufflÃ¨n storms along the plaÃ¯n, An' blacken'd leaves did lie below The neÃ¤ked tree, a-zoak'd wi' raÃ¯n, I werden at a loss to vill The darkest hour o' raÃ¯ny skies, If I did vind avore my eyes The feÃ¤ces down at Leeburn Mill. PRAISE O' DORSET. We Dorset, though we mid be hwomely, Be'nt asheÃ¤m'd to own our pleÃ¤ce; An' we've zome women not uncomely; Nor asheÃ¤m'd to show their feÃ¤ce; We've a meÃ¤d or two wo'th mowÃ¨n, We've an ox or two wo'th showÃ¨n, In the village, At the tillage, Come along an' you shall vind That Dorset men don't sheÃ¤me their kind. Friend an' wife, Fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, Happy, happy, be their life! Vor Dorset dear, Then gi'e woone cheer; D'ye hear? woone cheer! If you in Dorset be a-roamÃ¨n, An' ha' business at a farm, Then woont ye zee your eÃ¤le a-foamÃ¨n! Or your cider down to warm? Woont ye have brown bread a-put ye, An' some vinny cheese a-cut ye? Butter?ârolls o't! Cream?âwhy bowls o't! Woont ye have, in short, your vill, A-gi'ed wi' a right good will? Friend an' wife, Fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, Happy, happy, be their life! Vor Dorset dear, Then gi'e woone cheer; D'ye hear? woone cheer! An' woont ye have vor ev'ry shillÃ¨n, ShillÃ¨n's wo'th at any shop, Though Dorset chaps be up to zellÃ¨n, An' can meÃ¤ke a tidy swop?

An' so comely, An' so hwomely, Be the maÃ¯dens, if your son Took woone o'm, then you cry âWell done!â Friend an' wife, Fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, Happy, happy, be their life! Vor Dorset dear, Then gi'e woone cheer; D'ye hear? woone cheer! If you do zee our good men travel, Down a-voot, or on their meÃ¤res, Along the windÃ¨n leÃ¤nes o' gravel, To the markets or the feÃ¤irs,â Though their hosses cwoats be ragged, Though the men be muddy-laggÃ¨d, Be they roughish, Be they gruffish, They be sound, an' they will stand By what is right wi' heart an' hand. Friend an' wife, Fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, Happy, happy, be their life! Vor Dorset dear, Then gi'e woone cheer; D'ye hear? woone cheer!</field>
