      <field name="fulltext">The Valley of the Shadow of Death. EUTHANASIA. I. THE PARTING. I goâthe night-lamp flickers In crystal socket deep, As throbbing to the murmurs Of thy short, restless sleep. On thy pale brow the shadows Of the closed curtains fall, I watch the long dark figures They cast on the cold wall. And I can see thee heaving The long white counterpane,â When shall I keep the night-watch By thy sick couch again? I goâthe cold bright morning Breaks up in the grey sky, On wood, and stream, and valley, And those green hills that lie All to the blue sea looking; And through the breaking dark I hear the pigeon cooing, The first song of the lark. O time, O youth, O gladness, How swiftly have ye sped Since we have watched the sunsets From yon green mountain head! Where is the step that bounded So lightly from the ground, The ring of that sweet laughter That hath no fellow sound; The large dark eye, all radiant With glad and glorious thought? O suffering, O sorrow, How surely have ye wrought! Now wasted form, and languor, And lowly-breathed word, And pain, and unrest weary, And pale lips roughly stirr'd. Hush, false and vain repining, Nor drop hot tears of mine! Doth man not cut the diamond That it may brighter shine? Do we not cast the fine gold Into the cleansing fire? Is not the child most cherish'd Still chasten'd of its sire? And saints wear crowns of glory Through Heaven's eternal years, With brightest rays around themâ All framed from earthly tears. Hush! there are unseen watchers Round the blest sufferer now, And angel-hands, all gently, Smooth down her pale high brow! Hush! He is here in presence Who knew all pain and care, Nor ever layeth on His own A cross they cannot bear! Hush! for a dear hand beckons Her soul to the bright shore, Like Summer hasting after The young Spring gone before! I goâO parting sorrow, O anguish of vain tears, Why will ye mock meâbringing The shades of our past years? Twin spirit to my spirit, When thou hast left my side What other love shall comfort? What other voice shall guide? Hush! in our high communion There is no broken link, And lights gleam through the shadows On the dark river's brink! One hope, one faith, one heaven; These years how fast they speed; There is no endless parting, No, never, in our creed. II. THE LAST COMMUNION. I may not chafe thy weary temple, I may not kiss thy dear pale face; But spirit answereth to spirit, And loving thought o'erleapeth space. And thus within thy far sick chamber Mine heart communion holds with thine, I see the kneeling kindred gather, The broken bread, the hallow'd wine. Hush, heaving sigh! Hush, murmur'd whisper! Swell forth, ye words of love and dread! âTake, eat, His life for you was given; Drink ye; His blood for you was shed!â Dim grows thy dark eye, kneeling mother, There's anguish on thy bended brow; Ay, weep, there come no second flowers When Autumn strips the laden bough. O broken spirit, meek-eyed creature, Well may thy brimming eyes run o'er, Since yet a darker drop may mingle Within the cup so full before! And thou, too, honour'd one and cherish'd, Most happy wife and mother blest, There comes a cloud o'er thy pure heaven, Which not the brightness of the rest, Which not even his dear love who kneeleth Close at thy side can banish quite; For stars that have an equal lustre Yet shine not with each other's light. Come, gentle nurse, come, fair young sisters, Draw closer still the narrowing chain, Another golden link must sever, Ye cannot commune thus again. Once more, once moreâdeath's deepening shadow Broods o'er our little field of light, Ere yet the heavy cloud is scatter'd That wrapp'd our fairest from our sight. Whom, as we linger by thy pillow, Dear saint, in look, in smile, in tone, We trace again, like skies reflecting The sunlight when the sun is gone. Still swells the Eucharistic measure, The feast of love and life is o'er, The angels joining, and archangels, And saints who rest and sin no more. Ah! not at Christ's own altar kneeling, Our hearts should thrill, our eyes grow dim, As though we had not known His presence, And were not ever one in Him. The deadâthey are the truly living, They live to God, to love, to us; Why should the prescience of brief parting Sadden the Christian spirit thus? Nay, gently lay her on His bosom,â Nay, gladly give her to His care, Lest we forget in our own sorrow How bright the crown His ransom'd wear. III. THE CHILD IN THE SICK ROOM. The glorious sun sinks slowly o'er The purple ocean broad and even, While, pale and pure, one little star Rides up the eastern heaven. The sunset hues of coming death Have touch'd her cheek, and lit her eye; The mother hath borne in her babe To greet her ere she die. With solemn look, and passive arms, That stretch not now for love's embrace, He looketh long and earnestly On that sweet, holy face; As if the soul, untainted yet, And fresh from the Redeemer's touch, New-wash'd in His own blood, who loves His little ones so much; With that bright spirit purified, In suffering faithful to the end, Held some mysterious communing We could not comprehend. As if to him unveil'd had been Angelic forms and mysteries, And awfully the parting soul Look'd through her bright dark eyes. Gaze on, the sunlight lingers yetâ The brow is there, with genius fraught, The parted lips that pour'd so well The music of her thought. The brow all calm, the face all fair, The eye all brilliant as of yore, Each line by beauty so refined, It could refine no more. Gaze onâand Oh, as Eastern skies Glow when the western heaven is bright, Perchance thy soul may catch a gleam From yonder fading light! Because her lips for thee have vow'd, Have pray'd for thee in hours of pain, It cannot be, thou precious child, Those prayers shall prove in vain. But they will bring a blessing back, As ofttimes 'neath the summer moon The dewy mists that heavenward rise Fall down in showers at noon. And thou wilt be a holy saint, Christ's soldier true in fights to come, Wilt bear His cross as patiently, And go as gladly home. Gaze on, gaze on, some scenes there are Too fair to ruffle with a sigh, So let us learn of childish awe, And wait in silence by! IV. THE ANNIVERSARY.âTO E. G. H. I know thou art awake to-nightâ Thy tears are flowing fast, Keeping our Saint's nativity, And dreaming of the past. Thou weepest for the calm sweet smile That ne'er again can charm, For the dear head that, hour by hour, Droop'd meekly on thine arm; For the young lip where wisdom hungâ The honey on the rose; For the high spirit calm'd and bow'dâ Faith's beautiful repose. Ah! which of us that watch'd that tide Of ebbing life depart, Can hear its echoing surge to-night, Nor tears unbidden start? But tears so blended as they rise, Of mingled joy and woe; Like sourceless streams, we cannot tell What fountain bids them flow. That gush of sorrowâcould she rest Again upon thy side, Uplooking with those patient eyes, Perchance she would not chide. But couldst thou see her whom thy care So tended, worn and faint, Clothed with the beauty of the blest, The glory of the Saintâ That beauty of the spirit-land Beyond our brightest dreamâ Sure in thy soul the tide of joy Would drown that darker stream. And varying thought in gentle strife Would all thy soul employ, Of holy human tenderness With earnest Christian joy. So keep we watch to-night, my love, And ever, at His feet Who bade His angel at this hour Steal on her slumber sweet; And suffer'd not his ruffling wing To break upon her ear, But will'd that she should never know Death's agony and fear. O Christ, our stay, our strength, as hers, Make, too, our dying bed, 'Tis but in presence of Thy love We dare recal the dead! V. THE PLACE OF REMEMBRANCE. Where wouldst thou think of her? Where the young flowers Spring through the turf where so often she lay, Wearily watching the long summer hours, Last of her lifetime, fleet slowly away? There by the garden-wall, cover'd with roses, Where, in the shelter, she linger'd so late, Under the tree where the shadow reposes, Over the spot where at noontime she sate? Down the green walk where you drew her so slowly, Patient and sweet in her helpless decay, In her own chamber, the haunted and holy, There wouldst thou dream of thy darling to-day? Where wouldst thou think of her, darkling and dreary? In the lone room where her spirit took flight, Passing away, as a child that is weary Turns to its cradle, nor wishes Good-night? Where, like a wild dream, thy heart still remembers The lingering smile on the motionless clayâ A flame that lives on in the light of its embersâ There wouldst thou dream of thy darling to-day? Not in the greenwood gladeâhearts need not borrow Helps from dead nature to teach them to weep, Not in that lonely room;âwhy should thy sorrow Brood o'er her, silent and shrouded in sleep? Go to the altar, where, morning and even, The low voice has mingled, the bright head bow'd down, Pouring her heart out in commune with Heaven, Taking His cross up who gave her the crown. Everywhere, everywhere holdeth communion, Loving and cheering, her spirit with thine, But in a holier, happier union, Meet you with praises to-night at the shrine. Then in the vale, when the waters are swelling, Go where the desolate bird finds a nest, Go to His holy and beautiful dwelling, The courts of the Lord, where she dwelt and was blest. Where the church mingles her happy departed, Victors gone home with the strugglers who stay, Bringing forth balm for the desolate-hearted,â There shouldst thou dream of thy darling to-day! VI. RECOLLECTIONS.âTO F. L. I have been dwelling on enchanted ground, Looking on thee, and dreaming of the past; A spell of shrouded faces and lost sound Thou hast around me cast. Sorrow and joy, thought within thought enshrined, Childhood and youth I have lived o'er again, As one chance note unlinketh to the mind The whole of a sweet strain. Thus, with the truest love my heart has known, Thy kindred form so dearly blended seems, Thine accents have an echo of the tone That haunts me in my dreams. A thousand thrilling thoughts thou bring'st to me Of our old days of happiness on earth; I tremble at thy smile, thy laughter free, Thy little words of mirth. And I have mused until I seem'd to stray, With thee and others, down a twilight glade, Where sweet pale faces gleam'd upon our way, And silver voices pray'd. Shadows, and smiles, and gifted words were there, It was the dream-land of our by-gone hours, Just on the verge methought grew fresh and fair, Two rathe and sunny flowers. Pure balmy germs they grew within their shells, Two cherish'd things, love-tended night and day, With blue eyes peeping from their silver bells, And breath as sweet as May. There was a spirit with us in the groveâ I saw her linger where the first flower grew, Breathe o'er it gently words of hope and love, And leave it bathed in dew. Now from thy presence, and its soothing power, From voice, and look, and day-dream of the heart, From balmy breath of childhood's opening flower, Dear one, I must depart. Go thou unto thy gleeful nursery, Where voices mingle soft, and bright eyes gleam, And when thy fair-hair'd children climb thy knee, Read thou my parting dream. ADDED FOR C. L. He said he was forgotten in the strain, When we roam'd through that love-enchanted spot, As if there could be, of thy joy or pain, A dream where he was not. As if her sainted lips had ever pray'd, Or her eyes fill'd for thee in thankfulness, Nor blest his love true-hearted who had made Her darling's happiness. In every swelling chord are many notes So closely blended, they seem all the same, As, high and far, the glorious measure floats,â We do not ask their name. VII. LINES. The stars sink one by one from sight, No trace of them we find; They vanish from the brow of night, And none is left behind Alone, And none is left behind. The sun goes to his ocean-bed, In all his rays enshrined, He wraps them round his crimson head, And leaveth none behind To mourn, And leaveth none behind. The beautiful and gifted dead, The noblest of our kind, Have cast their work aside and fled, And we are left behind Alone, And we are left behind. The dear old friends of early time, Hearts round our hearts entwined, Have faded from us in their prime, And we are left behind To mourn, And we are left behind. Pale stars, red sun, ye come again, For whom no heart has pined, We call our darlings back in vain, Still are we left behind Alone, Still are we left behind. Oh, dear ones, teach us so to run Our race, in sun and wind, That we may win where ye have won, Though we be left behind Awhile, Though we be left behind! VIII. THE LAST EVENING. Linger a moment ere 'tis o'erâ This last of our sweet evening hours. As wanderers, leaving some fair shore, Might pause to snatch a few bright flowers, Which on their beating hearts they lay, Memorials of that sunny clime; Dear friends, shall we not bear away Thoughts of this happy time? Have we no flowers of memory Close at our hearts to treasure fair, Perchance to wither as they lie, But sometimes still to scent our air? Bright thoughts of love and joy to come, In hours of toil and weariness, And bring us, in each distant home, Gleams of this happiness. Shall we not dream when twilight shades, Drop o'er the dark earth's quiet face, How soft they touch'd the greenwood glade Around our happy trysting place, How blithely heart with heart did blend, How gentle was our sportive strife, Sisters and kin, each chosen friend, Dear brother, and young wife? Will there not come, when vespers chime, And one of all the band shall hear An echo from our service-time, Deep thrilling to each heart and ear? The spirits, by one impulse stirr'd, Swelling the church's even-song, The voice that falter'd o'er her word So solemn, deep, and strong. Ah! were we then in truth alone? Had not each loving heart a dream,â A glorious vision of its own, That all too bright for words did seem,â Whereat the tear unbidden springs; And yet it has no shade of gloom; As if two angels waved their wings Across the quiet room? Friends, gentle friends, the world is wide, And few the scatter'd sweets we find, We would not cast such flowers aside, Though we must leave the root behind. Then pause awhile on this last night, And linger o'er our parting strain, This commune sweet, this converse light, When will they come again? IX. THE CHAPEL. To E. C. L. on occasion of a Chapel being pulled down to build a Church on the site. Let none rebuke our sorrow, vainly swelling, Nor say we sin to taste, dishonour art, Because the bareness of this poor low dwelling Had grown entwined about our heart. Because no show of cluster'd arches bending, Nor slender shaft, nor storied window clear, Nor fretted roof, on pillars proud ascending, Can give the charm that linger'd here. For what is taste, but the heart's earnest striving After the beautiful in form and thought, From the pure past a nicer sense deriving, And ever by fair Nature taught; A strong creative instinct, making real Dreams framed from earth, or drawn down from above? These barren walls could give one bright ideal, And the heart's beautiful is love. Here, where no thrill of rapturous emotion, From impulse wrought by outward cause, might stir; Only His shrine, who claim'd our first devotion, And that calm, peaceful thought of her. This was the casket where our hearts embalm'd her, A reliquary fitting for a saint, Here, where His love had met, His mercy calm'd her When her poor human heart did faint. True, we have other records; there are places Rich with the fragrance of her hours most bright, When, full of gladness, look'd into our faces Those dark eyes, dancing in soft light. There is the room where her sick presence lingers, The couch whereon she lay, the book she read, The last words traced by her weak, weary fingers; But these are relics of the dead. These tell us of the ear that could not hear us In our worst anguish, of the close-seal'd eyes; Here was the spiritual presence near us Of the saved soul that never dies. Still on her place, when a dim ray fell slanting, There was a sound, known to our hearts alone, Of angels' wings; still with the choir's low chanting Mingled her gentle undertone. So shall it be no more,âa crimson splendour Shall break that wandering sunbeam's silver line, And bid it fall in tinted radiance tender On the pure pavement by the shrine. Down the long nave, the deep, full organ pealing, A hundred echoes, lingering, shall draw From roof, and niche, and sculptured angel kneeling In the fair fane she never saw. Why are our hearts fill'd with so many yearnings And adverse claimsâthat each to other callâ Admiring thought, and zeal, and inward burnings, And this deep, mournful love through all? We would not check the work of your adoring; We love when art, and wealth, and fervour meet, Their gifts most bright, most beautiful outpouring, Sweet ointment for our Master's feet. Still let us grieveâeven as a mother weepeth For some poor sickly child, in mercy ta'en; Deep in her heart his little spot she keepeth, But wishes him not back again. And if there be who meet us with upbraiding, Call back the lost lives of your early years, The deep, sad thoughts that ask no outward aiding, And leave us our few silent tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Missionary and Colonial. TO C. H. A. Who married a Clergyman, and went out with him to join the Bishop of New Zealand. Sent with a cross of Irish bog-oak. Out of the bosom desolate and deep Of her that was the âIsle of Saintsâ of old, Where, far below, her buried forests sleep, They cut this little cross of ancient mould. The Irish oak is cut out of the bogs which contain vast buried forests. It was probably in the days when these forests stood, that Ireland was celebrated for her schools of Christian learning. Type of her beautiful and glorious days, Her first pure days of faith, and lore, and love, When wanted not sweet Nature's note of praise; Her deep winds whispering down the leafy grove. I bid thee lay it on thy pilgrim breastâ I would some thought of us should go with thee, Some message from the melancholy west, To that bright isle beyond the southern sea. And oh, of all our thoughts most sweet, most vast, What better sign between our hearts than this? What fitter form to carve out of the past? What brighter presage of the future's bliss? Most meet for you, who not with thoughts of ease Gild your calm dreams of holy wedded life, Who bear your Master's cross beyond the seas, For earnest labour, and for weary strife. Meet symbol, too, from this fair isle forlorn, To her who hears the wide Pacific roar, Who sitteth in the twilight of her morn, Watching the lights that break along the shore; Hearkening a strain more sweet than rapt'rous burst Of wild bird's song when dawn is in the sky; An echo of the angels' song that erst Spake peace on earth, and told salvation night. And he who leads and modulates that strain, Wandering by pathless waste and lonely rock, Whose restless bark is ever on the main, Patiently gathering in his little flock. How will he look along the heaving tide, And bless the breeze that brings from the old land One brother more to labour at his side, Another sister to his exiled band. And ye will catch the burden of his song, Will swell the measure when perchance it faints, Bid gulf and cliff the glorious strain prolong, And make that isle another Isle of Saints. Pray for us, brother, sister,âlove doth make No count of space, devotion hath no boundâ And chief for them, the faithful few, who wake, Watching our island fold with foes around; And so farewell!âalready the winds greet Your out-bound sail, and lift the crested wave; How oft in thought, in hope, in heart, we meet By the dear sign of Him who died to save! PRAISE AND INTERCESSION. A traveller in North America, while resting at a lonely Inn, was roused at night by a voice chanting the Psalms; on inquiry, he found that it was the Bishop of Newfoundland chanting, alone, the Evening Service. Wake, wanderer, wake! a solemn voice Chants softly to the chill night air, In old familiar melody, Sweet strains of praise and prayer; Such strains as in thine own dear land Unnumber'd voices love to sing, When, morn and eve, the Bride of Heaven Brings homage to her King. Here are no old collegiate walls, No mighty minster fair and strong;â Whence caught this wild north-western waste The Church's evensong? Sleep, wanderer, sleep! thy mother's hand Is stretch'd to guard each wandering child, Her shepherd waketh for the flock Far scatter'd in the wild. 'Tis meet his deep, unwearied voice, Still, night and day, her songs renew, Like strain thrice echoed from the hills, Whose every note is true. Head of the Church, for ever near, Hear Thou Thy servant's evening hymn, Give that lone voice a power to raise From sleep more dark and dim: Be it a witness to Thy name, For truth, for love, for order dear, Charming the sinner from his path, Soothing the exile's ear. It dies beneath the wide grey Heaven, It dies along the silent plain, No answering flock, no deep-voiced choir Take up the solemn strain. Yet patience, strong and holy heart, Nor fear the full response shall come; Still waken with thy lonely note The desert dark and dumb. Deep down the course of coming years The chord shall vibrate yet again, And ages yet unborn shall hear That slumbering Amen. THE LOST CHILD. As when in sleep the mother deems She holds her dead child in her bosom, And feels a waxen hand, and dreams She sees again her perish'd blossom, And dearer, sweeter seems to her That image wan than any other; So should the thought within thee stir, Of thy lost children, island mother! No voice of dreams, it haunts thy soul Across the blue Pacific water, Above the wild Atlantic's roll, From many an exiled son and daughter: No vision'd forms, they wander there Beneath old woods' primeval shadows; Through coral-girded islands fair, By frozen rocks and sun-burnt meadows: Thy living dead, for whom the spring Is dried of spiritual being, And every sacramental thing That leads to the unseen All-seeing: They hear no more, when Sundays come, The old bells swing in village towers, A message from the angels' home Unto this work-day world of ours; No more they seek, in reverent haste, Christ's wedding-feast within His palace, Nor eat the precious bread, nor taste The wine-drop in the sacred chalice; For them no calm chance words are said By pastoral lips in love and meetness, Like breathings from a violet-bed, That touch the common air with sweetness; Therefore, lift up thine arm this day, Bid the Church meet them, island mother; Lest they forget her as they stray, Or falsely deem they find another. COME OVER AND HELP US. Souls in heathen darkness lying Where no light has broken through, Souls that Jesus bought by dying, Whom His soul in travail knew; Thousand voices Call us o'er the waters blue. Christians, say they, none has taught us Of His love so deep and dear, Of the precious price that bought us, Of the nail, the thorn, the spear; Ye who know Him Guide us from our darkness drear. Still, Mohammed's hosts adoring, Call untired their prophet's name, Morn and eve his aid imploring;â Tell the greater Chief who came, The true Prophet, Winning glory out of shame. Still, the Jew, in dreams unholy, Hails a conqueror's crimson reign, Scorns the Son of Mary, lowly:â Read him right the Prophet's strain, Christ can give him Israel's glories back again. Still old Asia's sages yearning, Grope for truth with darken'd eye, By the lamp within them burning, While the sun is in the skyâ Nothing dreaming Of the glorious light on high. Still the earth hath cruel places, Wrath, and hate, and vengeance grim,â Still God looks on human faces Heavenward turn'd, but not to Him; Slaves who know not Comfort in their anguish dim. Eastward far the bright sun breaking Treads the dark clouds into light, East and west the lands are waking, Other feet are on the height, More beautiful, Bearing words of love and might. Haste, O haste to spread the tidings, Let no shore be left untrod, No lost brother's bitter chidings Haunt us from the furthest sod: Tell the heathen All the precious truth of God! LOOKING UP TO HEAVEN. Suggested by a passage in the Bishop of New Zealand's Journal, in which he describes having first seen the sun and then the moon go down, and being afterwards lighted on his journey by the constellations of the Southern Cross and the Triangle. The sun sinks o'er the western sea And o'er the trackless plain, Where the good Bishop wearily Leads on his scanty train; The moon fades from the brow of night, Dark broods the lonely hour, No passing gleam of social light Shines out from hall and bower; Such gleam as dear old England sees From the closed casement far At even, through her tall dark trees; The peasant's polar star; Which, wearied with his long day's toil, He greeteth far away; Christ's labourer tills a harder soilâ Hath he no cheering ray? Yes, wanderer, look, to heaven's blue height The Southern Cross ascends, And, bathing all thy path in light, Thine âown Triangleâ bends. Sweet stars, there lies a gentle lore In Nature's shadowings, And we may find in her full store The types of holier things. God's holy Church, mysterious still, Wends on, from age to age, Through this dark world of strife and ill, Her lonely pilgrimage; And darkness meets her on the wold, And frowns the gathering foe, And hearts are false, and love is cold, And even faith burns low: Because we look not up on high Where waves the red cross wide, Nor think how He who died to save, Still guards His mystic Bride; Because we have no hearts to see Bright, as in days of old, The presence of the Eternal Three Within her sacred fold. And thou to whom thy Lord has given The crozier and the key, And bade thee tend the Bride of Heaven, Girt by that southern sea, What though cold-hearted Christians fear, What though the heathen frown, Though all the waste be wild and drear, And sun and moon go down, Yet shalt thou lay Redemption's sign On many a savage brow, And many a rudely sacred shrine Shalt to the Triune vow; And hope on them and peace be pour'd, Who see thy face no more,â The exile labouring for his Lord Upon that heathen shore!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[Churches.] ON AN OLD FONT IN THE WARDEN'S GARDEN AT WINCHESTER. Sigh not, nor deem that stone profaned Whose lip has held, in olden day, The hallow'd waters, where the stain'd Wash'd earth's first taint away. Still dearly love that sculptured shrine Where hallow'd genius loved to bring Her curious work, her rare design, To God in offering. The clustering arch, the storied pane Still proudly prizeâbut let no thought Sin to the fairer, statelier fane, That His own hand has wrought; Nor deem that broken font misplaced Within this graceful garden-ground, Flowers such as chisel never traced Are here to clasp it round. Here through the quiet Summer night, Long silent nights without a cloud, It lieth; in the sweet star-light Wrapt like a silver shroud. Here incense sweet, at morn and even, From countless censers riseth up, And pure bright dew-drops, fresh from Heaven, Fall in its broken cup. Still through its guardian plane-trees tall The fretted window fairly shows, And on the turf the chapel wall A stately shadow throws. Still when the stream's wild bubble dies, A deep sweet chant is on the air, Teaching our hearts to harmonize The holy and the fair; The hoary tower, the shadowy tree, The stream, the flowers entwining gay, Genius, and love, and piety, Old strength and fair decay; Here met and mingledâall His own, Who Nature framed, who guided art, Inspired the hand that traced the stone, And stain'd the lily's heart. Marble and flower to Him look up, His presence hallows shrine and sod; Deem not they desecrate the cup Who leave it here with God. OUTSIDE. I. In Spirit. On seeing a Lady perverted to Romanism stand outside Winchester Cathedral during Evening Service. Dost thou stand at thy mother's threshold, And wilt not enter in, Though her sweet voice patiently swelleth Over the city's din? Could a wandering child thus linger Outside the latticed pane, If she heard her own mother singing, Within, her cradle strain? If she saw, through the narrow casement, The lights on the hearth-stone burn, And her brethren there, and her sisters Waiting their sire's return? Down the long nave falleth the measure That sooth'd thy childhood's rest, And the mother is singing vespers, Who bore thee on her breast; And the fire is bright on the altar, And the worshippers are thereâ Wilt thou stand alone on the threshold, Out in the evening air? II. In Body. Thou hast been dwelling in a gleam Of glorious light, sent down from Heaven, It mingled with thy morning dream, It broke the twilight of thine even; It came with concord of sweet sounds, With herald strains of church-bells ringing, With words of mercy breathing round, With chanted prayers and choral singing. Along thy daily path it lay, For inward peace, for added grace, And thou didst linger in the ray; The world shut out a little space. 'Tis past, or if it linger yet, Poor weary heart, 'tis not for thee, Still, day by day, those sweet bells set Chime to the murmur of the sea. Still by the fair shrine never cease The cry of penitence and prayerâ The answering voice of hope, and peace, And comfort,âbut thou art not there. In vain the distant measure thrills Thine heart, and vibrates in thine ear, 'Tis but an echo from the hills, That cheats the home-sick mountaineer; 'Tis but the wild wave's murmuring tone In ocean-shell far inland heard;â But say not, dream not, thus alone Is heavenward thought and rapture stirr'd. Sweet are the strains that upward float When Christian hearts in unison meet, And passing sweet the pastoral note That bears them to a Saviour's feet. But, these denied, let no quick word Or thought o'er fond, or hopeless sigh, O living temple of the Lord! Sin to Thine inward commune high. Thou hast a shrine no hand can close, No duty leave its courts untrod, Where the true heart in secret knows The presence of the spirit's God. There grief may all her woes reveal, There penitence may bring her shame, Submission by the altar kneel, And self-denial feed the flame; There patience, wearing duty's chain, And meek-faced love, and pure desire, May breathe within as sweet a strain As ever thrill'd from yonder choir; There, though thy heart in vain should yearn For other voice, estranged or dumb, If thine own incense duly burn, The great High Priest Himself shall come. Ah! dream in sorrowing mood no more, Of vows unpaid, uncancell'd sin, Thou art not shut from Eden's door, Thy truest Heaven is found within. Deep in that wounded heart of thine The temple of thy refuge lies, Thyself the altar and the shrine, And thine own heart the sacrifice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miscellaneous. WITHERED LEAVES. Delicate leaves, with your shifting colours, Crimson and golden, or russet brown, Under what sunsets of calm October, Out of what groves were ye shaken down? When the sun, dying in red and amber, Tinted the woods with the hues he wore, As the stain'd light in a great cathedral, Through the east-window, falls on the floor. In your high homes where the tall shafts quiver, And the green boughs, like a trellis, cross, When ye grow brighter, and change, and wither, Symbols ye are of our gain and loss. Hopes that we cherish'd, and grand ideals, Dreams that to colour and substance grew, Ah! they were lofty and green and golden, Now they lie dead on our hearts like you. Silent as snow from his airy chamber, Down on the earth drops the wither'd leaf, Silently back, on the heart of the dreamer, Noticed of none, falls the secret grief. Yet ye deceive us, beautiful prophets; For like one side of an ocean shell, Cast by the tide on a dripping sand-beach, Only a half of the truth ye tell. Much of decadence and death ye sing us, Rightly ye tell us earth's hopes are vain, But of the life out of death no whisper, Saying, âWe die, but we live again.â Bring us some teacher, O leaves Autumnal, Some voice to sing, from your crimson skies, Of the home where our hope is immortal, Of the land where the leaf never dies. [Waves, waves, waves] Waves, waves, waves, Graceful arches, lit with night's pale gold, Boom like thunder through the mountain roll'd, Hiss and make their music manifold, Sing, and work for God along the strand. Leaves, leaves, leaves, Beautified by Autumn's scorching breath, Ivory skeletons, carven fair by death, Fall and drift at a sublime command. Thoughts, thoughts, thoughts, Breaking, wave-like, on the mind's strange shore, Rustling, leaf-like, through it evermore, O, that they might follow God's good hand! MUSIC AT NIGHT. Still lingers eve with fond delay, Though night has claim'd yon lovely shore, And sends from far her shadow grey, Pale twilight stealing on before. And yonder waves of varying sheen, The distant headland's line of blue, The tall red cliffs, the soft sea-green, Are mingling in one misty hue. 'Tis pastâthat gleam of crimson light, The last faint blush of lingering day; Now leaning from her stately height The silver moon looks on the bay. And restless waves, that loved to chide, And fling their foam-like showers of snow, Calm as a lake without a tide, Lie still and quiver in her glow. The clouds of grief have dimm'd his eye, The waves of woe have swell'd his breast; What pure pale planet draweth nigh Whose look can soothe them all to rest? Come, fairer than yon crescent moon; Come, touch the tone he loves so well; And grief and care shall slumber soon, And sorrow own the soothing spell. Come with thy calm and quiet grace, Thy meek, soft smile and silver tone, The rose-tints deepening on thy face, And charm as thou canst charm alone. There's not a wave on yon wide sea But thrills to that pure power above, Nor heart-string, weary though it be, But trembles to the touch of love. From Nature's beauteous outward things What gleams of hidden life we win! For still the world without us flings Strong shadows of the world within. Sweet scene! we shall not love thee less Because thy pulses, wild and free, With our home-dream of happiness This hour have thrill'd in harmony. Rather, a thousand-fold more fair, Thy sea, thy shore, fresh charms shall borrow, For they have heard the tender air She sang to-night to soothe his sorrow. Torquay, 1850.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Voices for the Dumb. PRELUDE. These lines refer to a calamitous fire at the Derry and Raphoe Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, in which six of the inmates perished. When her nest is scatter'd, a complaining On the spray the little mother weaves, From her heart's wild harp its sorrows raining, Thick as shadows from the shaken leaves. There are lands, wherein, when Death's white fingers Tap at last upon the sick-room pane, Send the neighbours all their sweetest singersâ Comes the minstrel of the cunning strain. Sweetly are the singers measure keeping; Sweetly, sweetly do the minstrels play; Till the hot heart finds a vent in weeping, As in rain the sultry summer day. Nest and nestlings Death from us hath taken; Ruin broods upon our labour now; Ours is only like the music shaken By the wild bird from the hawthorn bough. Death climb'd up with crown of fire above himâ Not as sometimes to the child he comes, Gentle, so that we can almost love him, Knocking at the nurseries of our homesâ But with red eyes, mad in anger mortal, And his red hair streaming wildly o'er, Flashing fiery swords before the portal, Hissing, like a serpent at the door. We are but as poor musicians, ringing On their harps some natural rise and fallâ We are only like the singers, singing At the children's lowly funeral! I. THE VOICE OF LAMENTATION. When the crimson ray Of parting day On the fire-tipp'd mountains dies away, Who would not love To pass above, Where the silver clouds like snow-flakes move! Beyond the bars Where the first pale stars Come riding out on their golden cars, And learn the cause That moves and draws All natural things with its wondrous laws! And oftener still Our wayward will Would know the reason of good or ill, And seek to raise The veil God lays Over His deep mysterious ways. When some dear scheme Of our life doth seem Shiver'd at once like a broken dream, And our hearts reel Like ships that feel A sharp rock grating against their keel. For, Oh! the tone Of the children's moan, Has haunted our ears since that midnight lone; And tears have sprung, And hearts been wrung, For the musicless lip and the speechless tongue; For the seal'd ear That could not hear When the red fire roar'd to the starlight clear, Like the battle-cry, When no help is nigh, Of a terrible, unseen enemy. And far away, By hill and bay, Hearts have been mourning them night and day. Where Foyle runs down To her famous town, Telling her banks of their old renown. Where the rays make A silver wake, Dancing in light on the shadowy lake, Whose soft waves pour For evermore, With a regular fall on her shingly shore. In the long reach Of sandy beach, Where the wild sea-eagles at Malin screech, And rock-reefs stand, Far out from the land, Like a chieftain charging in front of his band. In grassy sweeps Where the lone hut sleeps, Rock'd by winds from the furzy steeps Of hills that rest, With gold on their breast, Like kings in their regal garments drest. There mothers weep In anguish deep, Starting at night in uneasy sleep, And wave-wash'd reef, And winds in the leaf, Are set by their sorrow to songs of grief. âOh, for one breath, In that hot death, Of the cool wind over the fragrant heath; Oh, for one wave,â They cry, âto lave Those poor, little hearts in their burning grave.â God's Spirit sweet Quench Thou the heat Of our passionate hearts that rave and beat; Quiet their swell, And gently tell, That God's right hand doeth all things well. Under the shroud Of His thunder cloud Lie we still when His voice is loud, And our hearts shall feel His love-notes steal, As a bird sings after the thunder-peal. O Spirit dear, Bring Him us near, Who bore our sorrows and felt our fear; Who tenderly weighs Each cross that He lays, And saveth the soul that in mercy He slays. Tell us they heard (Whom never a word Of our articulate language stirr'd) That sweeter speech That shall one day reach All nations and tonguesâin the heart of each. In the dark room, When the shriek of doom Echoless knock'd at their heart's dull gloom, Tell us Christ came, And call'd by name Each little lamb from the scorching flame. Tell us that He, As erst with the âthree,â Walk'd with those six in their agony; Drew them in nigher, And wafted them higher, To Heaven, whose chariot and horsemen are fire. II. THE VOICE OF HOPE. What is the saddest sound that ever gave Its weight of woe unto the earth or wave?â A river, ringing out its long, low knell, As when a poet sings his sorrow well? A sea that sobs in starlight on the beach, With some great anguish shaking all his speech? A wind, that droneth out its midnight mass For the dead Summer, in a mountain pass? Nay, none of these. Rhyme on, O ancient river! Break, break, O sea, upon thy beach for ever! And thou, wild wind, thy requiem intone, In the dark pine-wood, round the grey cairn stone! But all that sadness comes from conscious powers, And all those sobbings are not theirs, but ours; And they are but as bells that nature times, While we lend language to her random chimes. A sad, sweet voice is by the river's brink, But only sad and sweet for those who think. The mute old mountain hath no head to acheâ The stern old ocean hath no heart to break. Not from the sea, his grand and grief-full tune Wailing on silver trumps to the white moon. The saddest sounds are still the sounds that start From the dark sea men call a human heart! But saddest of the saddest unto me Is the poor mutes' unmusical mimicry. Fair to a mother's eye the tiny flower That grows so gently in her nursery bower; Sweet to her ear the scarce-articulate word, The first faint murmur of her little bird: But the mute's mother listensâoh, how long! And her bright bird can sing her no sweet song; And his voice rings not on with joy elate, Like flower-bells swinging with their own sweet weight. Dim rain the sunlights on the blind boys' face, They make no sunshine in that shady place; Yet love invisible bids his path rejoice, Known, like the sky-lark, by its exquisite voice. To other children knowledge, year by year, Moveth in music through the open ear; And God's good spirit comes to all and each, With his wings spread upon the winds of speech. And words, those marvellous ships, whose freight is thought, Touch at the harbour of their hearts unsought. But he, in sun-lit silence, fares abroad, And his dark nature never felt for God; And no brave galley ever o'er the dim And formless void hath walk'd the waves to him. 'Twas o'er the sealÃ¨d ear, the tongue yet tied, The Man of Sorrows look'd to heaven and sigh'd. They, too, have sigh'd, who rear'd that lowly dome, Where the mute child might find his spirit's home. They, too, have look'd to Heaven: albeit no tongue For them were loosed, and no deaf man sung, Yet there, the cunning finger finely twined The subtle thread that knitteth mind to mind. There, that strange bridge of signs was built, where roll The sunless waves that sever soul from soul, And by the arch, no bigger than a hand, Truth travell'd over to the silent land. What though that tribe can have no poet strong To steep their sorrow in the wine of song; Though their dull language never bursts and stirs, As the gorse bursts out with its golden furze, And thoughts' poor thorn above life's dusty walk Hangs down no hawthorn-buds of pleasant talk. Is not our richer language all too weak? Are not our best thoughts, thoughts we cannot speak? The grandest lights that ever lit the seas, The grandest colour of the forest-trees, Look in lone beauty to the lone, blue sky, Unseen, unmiss'd by any mortal eye: So hath the mute high thoughts unseen abroad, Beautiful only for the eye of God!â There, over Reason's silent harp of gold Moved the wise hand, and out the music roll'd; There hove in sight through conscience' stormy mist, That new-discover'd isle, the love of Christ. There, too, they learn'd that life must never be Like a bird swinging on a wind-rock'd tree, But a great earnest thing that wrestles sore, Till the night cometh when the work is o'er. And did my gentle Saviour weep erewhile? Methinks I see Him look to Heaven and smile. Smiled He that night, who dust for joy returns, For life the ashes of so many urns? Smiled He who brought His little children nigher, Girt with a glory of consuming fire? Of old with healing things He sweetly cameâ Worketh He now His work with drops of flame? Often, methinks, the frown our blindness mourns, Is a smile shadow'd by the crown of thorns. Oft, just as morning comes with amice grey, Where we have wrestled till the break of day, The touch that shrinks our sinews where we stand, Is a love-token of the bleeding hand. Cry not in spirit o'er the blacken'd wall, âAshes for beauty! Home, and hearts, and all, Labour, the gift of gold, the work of prayer, Seek them, thou dreamer, in those ashes there!â Nay, let thy sorrow take a truer strain, Who work for God have never work'd in vain. We write âResurgamâ where our hearts entrust Love to the cold ground, and give dust to dust. When thy hopes dying hang with Him who died, Know that Good Friday hath its Easter-tide, Nor say, âThe Spring is maying on the meadows; The sunlights sail about the lake of shadows; The furze is burning goldenly all day, As if a stream of stars had lost its way; Each heather'd mountain in the silence weaves Raiment as purple as the passionate eve's. But mother's lips are ever making moan By Swilly's shore, by hills of dark Tyrone; For the small foot no longer prints the strand, And the bright eye sees not the purple land, And the swift step no longer bravely stirs The pale gold primrose, and the deep red furze; For her mute child is where no shadows float, No sunshine silvers any pilgrim's boat, Nor the great laughter of the deep, salt sea, Bids him behold, who cannot hear its glee.â Nay, Hope hath other strains than these in store. I hear her faintly singing o'er and o'erâ âThese from the fire, like those from Herod's sword, Unconscious martyrs, wait on their dear Lord. Our love is poorer by those perish'd things, But He is richer by six priests and kings; And sweeter strains across His temple pass, For six new harps are on the sea of glass.â III. THE VOICE OF THE MOTHER. Lady, lady,â the mother said, Low kneeling on the sod; âI came, I look'd upon my dead, And yet I thank my God.â And still she wept, and still she kneltâ âThe Lord God bless,â said she, âThe hands that work'd, the hearts that felt For my poor child and me. â'Tis not to look upon the place Where our darling lies at rest, That brings the salt tears to the face, The sorrow to the breast. â'Tis not to tell, in anguish sore, The manner of his going; For that brief bitterness is o'er, And time is ever flowing. âBut, oh, the mother's infinite loss, Who lays her treasure down, And knows he never knew the cross That only wins the crown. âAnd oh, the saltness of her tear On her christen'd heathen's grave, Who could not tell to his closed ear Of Him who waits to save. âHow many a time I wept and pray'd That Christ would wet the clay, And give the speechless creature aid, That in my bosom lay. âThat He would touch the poor ears dim, The lips so rosy fair, Would touch them to a sense of Him,â And Jesus heard my prayer. âI left him dull as ships afar, That lie becalm'd in port, And see the waves beyond the bar Dash to the winds in sport; âI cameâa new intelligence Had touch'd his soul's loose sail, And, tighten'd by that quickening sense, Each cord strain'd to the gale. âO blessed hope! my speechless boy Lies in his Saviour's breast; And what were years of this world's joy To that one thought of rest? âI hear no more the crackling flame,â He heard it not at all; I only know that Jesus came, And he could hear His call.â FINIS.</field>
