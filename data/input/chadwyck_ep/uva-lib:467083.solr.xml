      <field name="fulltext">Her Book By the Fireside II In the April sun at baby-house she plays. Her rooms are traced with stones and bits of bricks; For warmth she lays a hearth with little sticks, And one bright crocus makes a merry blaze! Babsie-Bird In the orchard blithely waking, Through the blossom, loud and clear, Pipes the goldfinch, “Day is breaking; Waken, Babsie; May is here! Bloom is laughing; lambs are leaping; Every new green leaflet sings; Five chipp'd eggs will soon be cheeping; God be praised for song and wings!” Warm and ruddy as an ember, Lilting sweet from bush to stone, On the moor in chill November Flits the stone-chat all alone: “Snow will soon drift up the heather; Days are short, nights cold and long; Meanwhile in this glinting weather God be thanked for wings and song!” Round from Maytime to November Babsie lilts upon the wing, Far too happy to remember Thanks or praise for anything; Save at bedtime, laughing sinner, When she gaily lisps along, For the wings and song within her— “Thank you, God, for wings and song!” The Sweet Pea Oh, what has been born in the night To bask in this blithe summer morn? She peers, in a dream of delight, For something new-made or new-born. Not spider-webs under the tree, Not swifts in their cradle of mud, But—“Look, father, Sweet Mrs. Pea Has two little babies in bud!” Heart-ease Last June—how slight a thing to tell!— One straggling leaf beneath the limes Against the sunset rose and fell, Making a rhythm with coloured rhymes. No other leaf in all the air Seemed waking; and my little maid Watched with me, from the garden-chair, Its rhythmic play of light and shade. Now glassy gold, now greenish grey, It dropped, it lifted. That was all. Strange I should still feel glad to-day To have seen that one leaf lift and fall. “Si j'avais un arpent” Oh, had I but a plot of earth, on plain or vale or hill, With running water babbling through, in torrent, spring, or rill, I'd plant a tree, an olive or an oak or willow-tree, And build a roof of thatch, or tile, or reed, for mine and me. Upon my tree a nest of moss, or down, or wool, should hold A songster—finch or thrush or blackbird with its bill of gold; Beneath my roof a child, with brown or blond or chestnut hair, Should find in hammock, cradle or crib a nest, and slumber there. I ask for but a little plot; to measure my domain, I'd say to Babs, my bairn of bliss, “Go, alderliefest wean, “And stand against the rising sun; your shadow on the grass Shall trace the limits of my world; beyond I shall not pass. “The happiness one can't attain is dream and glamour-shine!” These rhymes are Soulary's; the thoughts are Babs's thoughts and mine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Various Verses East of Eden Far down upon the plain the large round moon Sank red in jungle mist; but on the heights The cold clear darkness burned with restless stars: And, restless as the stars, the grim old King Paced with fierce choleric strides the monstrous ridge Of boulders piled to make the city wall. Muttering his wrath within his cloudy beard, He moved, and paused, and turned. The starlight caught The huge bent gold that ringed his giant head, Gleamed on the jewel-fringed vast lion-fells That clothed his stature, ran in dusky play Along the ponderous bronze that armed his spear. He fiercely scanned the East for signs of dawn; Then shook his clenchèd hand above his head, And blazed with savage eyes and brow thrown back To front the awful Presence he addressed: “Slay and make end; or take some mortal form That I may strive with Thee! Art Thou so strong And yet must smite me out of Thine Unseen? Long centuries have passed since Thou didst place Thy mark upon me, lest at any time Men finding me should slay me. I have grown Feeble and hoary with the toil of years— An aged Palsy—now, alas, no more That erst colossal adamant whereon Thine hand engraved its vengeance. Be Thou just, And answer when I charge Thee. Have I blenched Before Thy fury; have I bade Thee spare; Hath Thy long torture wrung one sob of pain, One cry of supplication from my mouth? But Thou hast made Thyself unseen; hast lain In ambush to afflict me. Day and night Thou hast been watchful. Thy vindictive eyes Have known no slumber. Make Thyself a man That I may seize Thee in my grips, and strive But once on equal terms with Thee—but once. Or send Thine angel with his sword of fire— But no; not him! Come Thou, come Thou Thyself; Come forth from Thine Invisible, and face In mortal guise the mortal Thou hast plagued!” The race of giants, sunk in heavy sleep Within the cirque of those cyclopean walls, Heard as it were far thunder in their dreams; But answer came there none from cloud or star. Then cried the aged King; “A curse consume Thy blind night fevered with the glare of stars, Wild voices, and the agony of dreams! Would it were day!” At last the gleam of dawn Swept in a long grey shudder from the East, Then reddened o'er the misty jungle tracts. The guards about the massive city gates Fell back with hurried whispers: “'Tis the King!” And forth, with great white beard and gold-girt brows, Huge spear, and jewelled fells, the giant strode To slake his rage among the beasts of prey. The fierce white splendour of a tropic noon; A sweltering waste of jungle, breathing flame; The sky one burning sapphire! By a spring Within the shadow of a bluff of rock The hoary giant rested. At his feet The cool green mosses edged the crystal pool, And flowers of blue and gold and rose-red lulled The weary eye with colour. As he sat There rose a clamour from the sea of canes; He heard a crash of boughs, a rush of feet; And, lo! there bounded from the tangled growth A panting tiger mad with pain and rage. The beast sprang roaring, but the giant towered And pashed with one fell buffet bone and brain; Then staggered with a groan, for, keen and swift, At that same instant from the jungle flew A shaft which to the feather pierced his frame. Shrill cries of horror maddened round the bluff: “Oh, Elohim, 'tis Cain the King, the King!” And weeping, tearing hair, and wringing hands, About him raved his lawless giant brood. But Cain spoke slowly with a ghastly smile: “Peace, and give heed, for now I am but dead. Let no man be to blame for this my death; Yea, swear a solemn oath that none shall harm A hair of him who gives me my release. Come hither, boy!” And, weeping, Lamech went And stood before the face of Cain; and Cain, Who pressed a hand against his rushing wound, Reddened his grandson's brow and kissed his cheek: “The blood of Cain alight on him who lifts A hand against thy life. My spear, boys! So. Let no foot follow. Cain must die alone. Let no man seek me till ye see in heaven A sign, and know that Cain is dead.” He smiled, And from the hollow of his hand let fall A crimson rain upon the crystal spring, Which caught the blood in glassy ripple and whirl, And reddened moss and boulder. Swift of stride, With gold-girt brow thrown back to front the Unseen, The hoary giant through the jungle waste Plunged, muttering in his beard; and onward pressed Through the deep tangle of the trackless growth To reach some lair, where hidden and unheard His savage soul in its last strife might cope With God—perchance one moment visible. A sweltering tract of jungle breathing flame; A fiery silence; all the depth of heaven One blinding sapphire! Watching by the cliff, The giant brood stood waiting for the sign. Behold! a speck, high in the blazing blue, Hung black—a single speck above the waste; Hung poised an hour; then dropped through leagues of air, Plumb as a stone; and as it dropped they saw Through leagues of high blue air, to north and south, To east and west, black specks that sprang from space, And then long sinuous lines of distant spots Which flew converging—growing, as they flew, To slanting streams and palpitating swarms; Which flew converging out of all the heavens, And blackened, as they flew, the sapphire blaze, And jarred the fiery hush with winnowing wings; Which flew converging on a single point Deep in the jungle waste, and, as they swooped, Paused in the last long slide with dangling claws, Then dropped like stone. Thus knew the giant brood That Cain was dead. Beside a swamp they found Hoar hair, a litter of white colossal bones, Ensanguined shreds of jewelled lion-fells, The huge gold crown and ponderous spear of Cain, And, fixed between the ribs, the fatal shaft Which Lamech shot unwitting; but against The life of Lamech no man lifted hand. Goodwin Sands Did you ever read or hear How the Aid—(God bless the Aid! More earnest prayer than that was never prayed.) How the lifeboat, Aid of Ramsgate, saved the London Fusilier? With a hundred souls on board, With a hundred and a score, She was fast on Goodwin Sands. (May the Lord Have pity on all hands— Crew and captain—when a ship's on Goodwin Sands!) In the smother and the roar Of a very hell of waters—hard and fast— She shook beneath the stroke Of each billow as it broke, And the clouds of spray were mingled with the clouds of swirling smoke As the blazing barrels bellowed in the blast! And the women and the little ones were frozen dumb with fear; And the strong men waited grimly for the last; When—as clocks were striking two in Ramsgate town— The little Aid came down, The Aid, the plucky Aid— The Aid flew down the gale With the glimmer of the moon upon her sail; And the people thronged to leeward; stared and prayed— Prayed and stared with tearless eye and breathless lip, While the little boat drew near. Ay, and then there rose a shout— A clamour, half a sob and half a cheer— As the boatmen flung the lifeboat anchor out, And the gallant Aid sheered in beneath the ship, Beneath the shadow of the London Fusilier! “We can carry may be thirty at a trip.” (Hurrah for Ramsgate town!) “Quick, the women and the children!” O'er the side Two sailors, slung in bowlines, hung to help the women down— Poor women, shrinking back in their dismay As they saw their ark of refuge, smothered up in spray, Ranging wildly this and that way in the racing of the tide; As they watched it rise and drop, with its crew of stalwart men, When a huge sea swung it upward to the bulwarks of the ship, And, sweeping by in thunder, sent it plunging down again. Still they shipped them—nine-and-twenty, (God be blessed!) When a man with glaring eyes Rushed up frantic to the gangway with a cry choked in his throat— Thrust a bundle in a sailor's ready hands. Honest Jack, he understands— Why, a blanket for a woman in the boat! “Catch it, Bill!” And he flung it with a will; And the boatman turned and caught it, bless him!—caught it, tho' it slipped, And, even as he caught it, heard an infant's cries, While a woman shrieked, and snatched it to her breast— “My baby!” So the thirtieth passenger was shipped! Twice, and thrice, and yet again Flew the lifeboat down the gale With the moonlight on her sail— With the sunrise on her sail— (God bless the lifeboat Aid and all her men!) Brought her thirty at a trip Thro' the hell of Goodwin waters as they raged around the ship, Saved each soul aboard the London Fusilier! If you live to be a hundred, you will ne'er— You will ne'er in all your life, Until you die, my dear, Be nearer to your death by land or sea! Was she there? Who?—my wife? Why, the baby in the blanket—that was she! Trafalgar O the merry bells of Chester, ancient Chester on the Dee! On that glittering autumn morning, eighteen five, Every Englishman was glad to be alive. It was good to breathe this English air, to see English earth, with autumn field and reddening tree, And to hear the bells of Chester, ancient Chester on the Dee. For like morning-stars together, sweet and shrill, In a blithe recurrent cycle Sang St. Peter and St. Michael, John the Baptist and St. Mary on the Hill; And the quick exulting changes of their peal Made the heavens above them laugh, and the jubilant city reel. In the streets the crowds were cheering. Like a shout From each spire the bickering bunting rollicked out. O that buoyant autumn morning, eighteen five, Every Englishman rejoiced to be alive; And the heart of England throbbed from sea to sea As the joy-bells clashed in Chester, jovial Chester on the Dee. Hark, in pauses of the revel—sole and slow— Old St. Werburgh swung a heavy note of woe! Hark, between the jocund peals a single toll, Stern and muffled, marked the passing of a soul! English hearts were sad that day as sad could be; English eyes so filled with tears they scarce could see; And all the joy was dashed with grief in ancient Chester on the Dee! Loss and triumph—joy and sorrow! Far away Drave the great fight's wreckage down Trafalgar Bay. O that glorious autumn morning, eighteen five, Every Englishman was proud to be alive! For the power of France was broken on the sea— But ten sail left of her thirty sail and three. Yet sad were English men as sad could be, For that, somewhere o'er the foreign wave, they knew Home to English ground and grass the dust of Nelson drew. Would to God that on that morning, eighteen five, England's greatest man of all had been alive, If but to breathe this English air, to see English earth, with autumn field and yellowing tree, And to hear the bells of Chester, joyful Chester on the Dee!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vignettes The Wanderer II He knows no home; he only knows Hunger and cold and pain; The four winds are his bedfellows; His sleep is dashed with rain. 'Tis nought to him who fails, who thrives; He neither hopes nor fears; Some dim primeval impulse drives His footsteps down the years. He could not, if he would, forsake Lone road and field and tree. Yet, think! it takes a God to make E'en such a waif as he. And once a maiden, asked for bread, Saw, as she gave her dole, No friendless vagrant, but, instead, An indefeasible Soul. Sea-Pictures II Enormous sea; immeasurable night! The shoreless waters, heaving spectral-white, Vibrate with showers and chains of golden sparks. The black boat leaves a track of flame. Beneath Run trails of blazing emerald, where the sharks Cross and re-cross. In many a starry wreath Innumerable medusæ shine and float. Great luminaries, through the blue-green air, Gleam on the face of one who slowly dies. All through the night two cavernous glazed eyes Look blankly upward in a rigid stare. O Father in heaven, he cannot speak Thy name; Take pity for the sake of Christ, Thy son! There is no answer, none. No answer, none. Crossing, re-crossing underneath the boat, The lean sharks weave their web of emerald flame.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sub Umbra Crucis “Crying Abba, Father” Abba, in Thine eternal years Bethink Thee of our fleeting day; We are but clay; Bear with our foolish joys, our foolish tears, And all the wilfulness with which we pray! I have a little maid who, when she leaves Her father and her father's threshold, grieves, But being gone, and life all holiday, Forgets my love and me straightway; Yet, when I write, Kisses my letters, dancing with delight, Cries “Dearest father!” and in all her glee For one brief live-long hour remembers me. Shall I in anger punish or reprove? Nay, this is natural; she cannot guess How one forgotten feels forgetfulness; And I am glad thinking of her glad face, And send her little tokens of my love. And Thou—wouldst Thou be wroth in such a case? And crying Abba, I am fain To think no human father's heart Can be so tender as Thou art, So quick to feel our love, to feel our pain. When she is froward, querulous or wild, Thou knowest, Abba, how in each offence I stint not patience lest I wrong the child, Mistaking for revolt defect of sense, For wilfulness mere spriteliness of mind; Thou know'st how often, seeing, I am blind; How when I turn her face against the wall And leave her in disgrace, And will not look at her or speak at all, I long to speak and long to see her face; And how, when twice, for something grievous done, I could but smite, and though I lightly smote, I felt my heart rise strangling in my throat; And when she wept I kissed the poor red hands. All these things, Father, a father understands; And am not I Thy son? Abba, in Thine eternal years Bethink Thee of our fleeting day; From all the rapture of our eyes and ears How shall we tear ourselves away? At night my little one says nay, With prayers implores, entreats with tears For ten more flying minutes' play; How shall we tear ourselves away? Yet call, and I'll surrender The flower of soul and sense, Life's passion and its splendour, In quick obedience. If not without the blameless human tears By eyes which slowly glaze and darken shed, Yet without questionings or fears For those I leave behind when I am dead. Thou, Abba, know'st how dear My little child's poor playthings are to her; What love and joy She has in every darling doll and precious toy; Yet when she stands between my knees To kiss good-night, she does not sob in sorrow, “Oh, father, do not break or injure these!” She knows that I shall fondly lay them by For happiness to-morrow; So leaves them trustfully. And shall not I? Whatever darkness gather O'er coverlet or pall, Since Thou art Abba, Father, Why should I fear at all? Thou'st seen how closely, Abba, when at rest, My child's head nestles to my breast; And how my arm her little form enfolds, Lest in the darkness she should feel alone; And how she holds My hands, my hands, my two hands in her own? A little easeful sighing And restful turning round, And I too, on Thy love relying, Shall slumber sound. [This grace vouchsase me for the rhymes I write.] This grace vouchsase me for the rhymes I write. If any last, nor perish quick and quite, Lord, let them be My little images, to stand for me When I may stand no longer in Thy sight: Like those old statues of the King who said, “Carve me in that which needs nor sleep nor bread; Let diorite pray, A King of stone, for this poor King of clay Who wearies often and must soon be dead!”</field>
