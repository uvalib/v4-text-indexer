      <field name="fulltext">To the most excellent Princesse, her Highnesse, the Princesse ELISABETH, Eldest daughter to the King of Bohemia. That my rude lines durst meet the dazeling rayes Of Majesty, which from your Princely eyes Would beat the owner back, blame them not, they Want sense, nor had they wit to bid me say Thus much in their behalfe: else having heard Y'are mercifull, they could not be affeard: Or doubting some arrest of sudden death Made haste to be reprived by your breath! True glory of your sex, whose single name Protecteth vertue, and commandeth fame. Now you have sav'd them with a looke, the rest Assume like boldnesse, and desire to taste Like honour, since they justly think their claim Better, by vertue of great Petrarchs name: Whom if they lamely follow tis more grace, Then t'have outgone a meaner Poets pace. Your milder judgement must the sentence give, For which they humbly wait to make them live. The humblest of your Highnesse servants Anna Hume. ANOTHER TO HER HIGHNESSE. I doe not dedicate these to delight Or profit you, both are the Authors right: Nor is it that your Highnesse may protect My part, it merits not so much respect; Nor that you may examine and compare, It lesse deserves such serious Princely care: Nor is it gratitude, because y' have been Pleas'd to approve some others you have seen: Since retribution so farre below Proportion, would be worse then still to owe: Nor vanity, that thus I may have leave To tell the world the honour I receive, In that my name hath reacht your sacred eare: I hate that emptie vice; yet need not feare The censure, were it just since 'twould make proud The staidest thoughts to be by you allow'd. If any aske me, What is then my end? 'Tis to approve my selfe a reall friend To chaste Lauretta, whom since I have tane From the dark Cloyster, where she did remain Unmarkt, because unknown, my aime is now To make her happy, by attending you: Where she may see her truest worth outgone, And learn more vertue then she yet hath known The humblest of your Highnesse servants Anna Hume. To the Reader. Reader, I have oft been told, Verse that speake not Love, are cold. I would gladly please thine eare, But am loth to buy 't too deare. And 'tis easier farre to borrow Lovers tears, then feel their sorrow. Therefore he hath furnish't me, Who had enough to serve all three. The Triumph of Love, Translated out of Petrarch. Chap. I. The Argument. A vision shews the captived By mighty Love in triumph led. It was the time, when I doe sadly pay My sighs, in tribute to that sweet-sowre-day, Which first gave being to my tedious woes: The Sunne, now o're the Bulls horns proudly goes, And Phaëton had renew'd his wonted race: When Love, the Season, and my owne ill case, Drew me that solitary place to finde, In which I oft unload my charged minde: There tir'd with raving thoughts and helplesse moans Sleep seal'd my eyes up, and my senses gone, My waking fancie spied a shining light, In which appear'd long pain, and short delight. A mighty Generall, I then did see, Like one, who (for some glorious victory) Should to the Capitol in triumph go: I (who had not been us'd to such a show In this soft age, where we no valour have But pride) admir'd his habit, strange and brave, And having rais'd mine eyes, which wearied were, To understand this sight was all my care. Foure snowie steeds a fiery Chariot drew; There sat the cruel boy; a threatning ewe His right hand bore, his Quiver arrowes held, Against whose force, no helme or shield prevail'd. Two party-coloured wings his shoulders ware; All naked else, and round about his chaire Were thousand mortals: some in battell tain, Many were hurt with darts, and many slain. Glad to learn newes I rose, and forward prest So farre, that I was one amongst the rest; As if I had been kill'd with loving pain Before my time; and looking through the train Of this teare-thirsty King, I would have spi'd Some of my old acquaintance, but descri'd No face I knew: If any such there were, They were transform'd with prison, death and care. At last one Ghost, lesse sad than th'others, came, Who neare approaching, call'd me by my name, And said: This comes of Love: What may you be, (I answer'd, wondring much) that thus know me? For I remember not t'have seen your face. He thus reply'd: It is the daskie place That dull's thy sight, and this hard yoake I beare: Else I a Thuscan am; thy friend, and deare To thy remembrance: his wonted phrase And voyce did then discover what he was. So we retir'd aside, and left the throng, When thus he spake; I have expected long To see you here with us; your face did seem To threaten you no lesse. I doe esteem Your prophesies; but I have seen what care Attends a Lovers life; and must beware. Yet have I oft been beaten in the field, And sometimes hurt, said I, but scorn'd to yeeld, He smil'd and said: Alas! thou dost not see, (My sonne) how great a flame's prepar'd for thee. I knew not then what by his words he meant; But since I finde it by the dire event: And in my memory 'tis fixt so fast, That marble gravings cannot firmer last. Mean while my forward youth did thus enquire: What may these people be? I much desire To know their names, pray, give me leave to aske. I thinke ere long, 'twill be a needlesse taske (Replied my friend) thou shalt be of the train, And know them all; this captivating chain Thy neck must beare, (though thou dost little feare) And sooner change thy comely forme and haire, Then be unfettered from the cruell tie, How ere thou struggle for thy liberty; Yet to fulfill thy wish, I wil relate What I have learn'd. The first that keeps such state, By whom, our lives and freedomes we forgoe, The world hath call'd him Love; and he (you know But shal know better when he comes to be A Lord to you, as now he is to me) Is in his child-hood milde, fierce in his age; 'Tis best beleev'd of those that feel his rage. The truth of this thou in thy selfe shalt finde, I warn thee now, pray keep it in thy mind. Of idle loosenesse, he is oft the childe; With pleasant fancies nourisht, and is stil'd Or made a God by vain and foolish men: And for a recompense, some meet their bane; Others, a harder slavery must endure, Than many thousand chains and bolts procure. That other gallant Lord, is conquerour Of conquering Rome, led captive by the faire Egyptian Queen, with her perswasive Art, Who in his honours claimes the greatest part: For binding the worlds victor with her charmes, His Trophees are all hers by right of armes. The next is his adoptive sonne, whose love May seem more just, but doth no better prove: For though he did his loved Livia wed, She was seduced from her husbands bed. Nero is third, disdainfull, wicked, fierce; And yet a woman found a way to pierce His angry soul. Behold Marcus the grave Wise Emperour is faire Faustina's slave: These two are tyrants: Dionysius, And Alexander, both suspicious, And yet both loved: the last a just reward Found of his causelesse feare. I know y' have heard Of him, who for Creusa on the rock Antandrus mourn'd so long; whose-warlike stroke At once, reveng'd his friend, and wonne his love: And of the youth whom Phedra could not move T'abuse his fathers bed; he left the place, And by his vertue lost his life (for base Unworthy loves to rage doe quickly change) It kill'd her too; perhaps in just revenge Of wronged Theseus, slain Hyppolito, And poore forsaken Ariadne: so It often proves that they who falsely blame Another, in one breath themselves condemne: And who have guilty been of treachery, Need not complain, if they deceived be. Behold the brave Heros a captive made With all his fame, and twixt these sisters led: Who, as he joy'd the death of th'one to see, His death did ease the others misery. The next that followeth, though the world admire His strength, love bound him. Th'other full of ire Is great Achilles, he whose pittied fate Was caus'd by love. Demophoon did not hate Impatient Phyllis, yet procur'd her death. This Jason is, he whom Medea hath Oblig'd by mischief; she to her father prov'd False, to her brother cruel; t'him she lov'd Grew furious, by her merit over-priz'd. Hypsiphile comes next, mournfull, despis'd, Wounded to see a strangers love prevail More then her owne a Greek. Here is the frail Fair Helena, with her the Shepherd boy, Whose gazing looks hurt Greece, and ruin'd Troy. 'Mongst other weeping souls, you heare the moan Enone makes, her Paris being gone. And Menelaus, for the woe he had To lose his wife. Hermione is sad, And cals her deare Orestes to her aid. And Laodamia, that haplesse maide Bewails Protesilaus. Argia prov'd To Polinice more faithfull then the lov'd (But false and covetous) Amphiaraos wife. The groanes, and sighes of those that lose their life By this kind Lord, in unrelenting flames You heare: I cannot tell you halfe their names, For they appeare not onely men that love, The gods themselves, doe fill this mirtle grove: You see faire Venus catch't by Vulcan's Art With angry Mars: Proserpina apart From Pluto, jealous Juno, yellow hair'd Apollo, vvho the young god's courage dar'd; And of his trophees proud, laught at the bovv, Which in Thessalia gave him such a blovv. What shal I say? here, in a vvord, are all The gods that Varro mentions, great and small; Each vvith innumerable bonds detain'd, And Jupiter before the chariot chain'd. The end of the first Chapter. Chap. II. The Argument. Brave Massinissa doth relate His Love: Seleucus his hard fate. Weari'd, not satisfi'd, with much delight, Now here, now there I turn'd my greedy sight, And many things I view'd: to write were long, The time is short, great store of passions throng Within my brest: when loe, a lovely paire, Joyn'd hand in hand, who kindly talking were, Drew my attention that way: their attire And forrain language quickned my desire Of further knowledge, which I soon might gain; My kinde Interpreter did all explain. When both I knew, I boldly then drew neare; He lov'd our countrey, though she made it feare. O! Massinissa; I adjure thee by Great Scipio, and her who from thine eye Drew manly tears (said I) let it not be A trouble, what I must demand of thee. He lookt, and said: I first desire to know Your name and qualitie; for well you show Y'have heard the combate in my wounded soul, When Love did Friendship, Friendship Love controul. I am not worth your knowledge, my poore flame Gives little light (said I:) your royall fame, Sets hearts on fire, that never see your face: But (pray you) say; are you two led in peace By him? (I shew'd their guide) your History Deserves record: it seemeth strange to me, That faith and cruelty should come so neare. He said; Thine owne expressions witnesse beare. Thou knowst enough, yet I will all relate To thee, 't will somewhat ease my heavie state. On that brave man my heart was fixt so much, That Lelius love to him could be but such; Where ere his colours marched, I was nigh, And Fortune did attend with victory: Yet still his merit call'd for more then she Could give; or any else deserve but he. When to the West the Romane Eagles came My self was also there; and catcht a flame, A purer never burnt in Lovers brest: But such a joy could not be long possest! Our nuptiall knot (alas!) he soone untide, Who had more power then all the world beside! He car'd not for our sighes; and though 't be true That he divided us, his worth I knew: He must be blinde that cannot see the Sunne, But by strict justice Love is quite undone: Counsel from such a friend gave such a stroke To Love, it almost split, as on a rock: For as my father I his wrath did feare, And as a sonne he in my love was deare; Brothers in age we were, him I obey'd, But with a troubled soul and look dismaid: Thus my dear halfe had an untimely death, She priz'd her freedome far above her breath; And I th'unhappy instrument was made; Such force th'intreaty and intreater had! I rather chose my self then him t'offend, And sent the poyson brought her to her end: With what sad thoughts I know, and shee'l confesse, And you, if you have sense of Love, may guesse; No heire she left me, but my tedious moan; And though in her my hopes, and joyes were gone, She was of lower value then my faith! But now farewell, and trie if this troup hath Another wonder; for the time is lesse Then is the taske: I pittied their distresse, Whose short joy ended in so sharp a woe: My soft heart melted: As they onward goe, This youth for his part, I perhaps could love (She said) but nothing can my minde remove From hatred of the Nation; He replide, Good Sophonisba you may leave this pride, Your City hath by us been three times beat, The last of which (you know) we laid it flat. Pray use these words t'another, not to me (Said she) if Africk mourned, Italy Needs not rejoyce; search your records, and there See what you gained by the Punick warre. He that was friend to both, without reply A little smiling, vanisht from mine eye Amongst the croud: As one in doubtfull way At every step looks round, and fears to stray, (Care stops his journey) so the varied store Of Lovers staid me, to examine more, And trie what kinde of fire burnt every brest: When on my left hand strayed from the rest Was one, whose looke exprest a ready minde In seeking what he joy'd, (yet sham'd to finde;) He freely gave away his dearest wife, (A new found way to save a Lovers life) She, though she joy'd, yet blushed at the change. As they recounted their affections strange, And for their Syria mourn'd; I tooke the way Of these three Ghosts, who seem'd their course to stay, And take another path: The first I held And bid him turne; he started, and beheld Me with a troubled look, hearing my tongue Was Romane, such a pause he made, as sprung From some deep thought; then spake as if inspir'd, For to my wish, he told what I desir'd To know: Seleucus is (said he) my name, This is Antiochus my sonne, whose fame Hath reacht your eare; he warred much with Rome, But Reason oft by Power is overcome. This woman, once my Wife, doth now belong To him; I gave her, and it was no wrong In our Religion; it staid his death, Threatned by Love; Stratonica she hath To name: so now we may enjoy one state, And our fast friendship shal out-last all date. She from her height was willing to descend; I quit my joy; he rather chose his end Then our offence; and in his prime had dide, Had not the wise Physician been our guide: Silence in Love ore came his vitall part; His Love was force, his Silence vertuous Art. A fathers tender care made me agree To this strange change. This said, he turn'd from me, As changing his designe, with such a pace, Ere I could take my leave, h' had quit the place. After the Ghost was carried from mine eye Amasedly I walkt; nor could untie My minde from his sad story; till my friend Admonisht me, and said: You must not lend Attention thus to every thing you meet; You know the number's great, and time is fleet. More naked prisoners this triumph had Then Xerxes souldiers in his army led: And stretched further then my sight could reach; Of severall Countreyes, and of differing speech. One of a thousand were not knowne to me, Yet might those few make a large History. Perseus was one, and well you know the way How he was catched by Andromida: She was a lovely brownet, black her haire And eyes. Narcissus too, the foolish faire, Who for his owne love did himselfe destroy; He had so much, he nothing could enjoy. And she, who for his losse, deep sorrow's slave, Chang'd to a voyce, dwells in a hollow cave. Iphis was there, who hasted his owne fate, He lov'd another, but himselfe did hate; And many moe condemn'd like woes to prove, Whose life was made a curse by haplesse love. Some modern Lovers in my minde remain, But those to reckon here were needlesse pain. The two, whose constant loves for ever last, On whom the winds wait while they build their nest; For Halcion dayes poore labouring saylers please, And in rough winter calme the boystrous seas. Far off the thoughtfull Æsacus, in quest Of his Epiria, findes a rocky rest, Then diveth in the floods, then mounts i'th' aire. And she who stole old Nisus purple haire His cruel daughter, I observ'd to fly. Swift Atalanta ran for victory, But three gold apples, and a lovely face, Slackt her quick paces, till she lost the race: She brought Hippomanes along, and joy'd That he, as others, had not been destroy'd, But of the victory could singly boast. I saw amidst the vain, and fabulous hoast, Faire Galatea lean'd on Atis brest; Rude Polyphemus noise disturbs their rest. Glaucus alone swims through the dangerous seas, And missing her who should his phansie please, Curseth the cruels Love transform'd her shape. Canens laments that Picus could not scape The dire enchantresse; he in Italy Was once a King, now a pie'd Bird; for she Who made him such, chang'd not his clothes nor name, His Princely habit still appears the same. Egeria, while she wept, became a Well: Scylla (a horrid rock by Circes spell) Hath made infamous the Sicilian strand. Next, she who holdeth in her trembling hand A guilty knife, her right hand writ her name. Pygmalion next, with his live mistresse came. Sweet Aganippe, and Castalia have A thousand more; all there sung by the brave And deathlesse Poets, on their faire banks plac'd; Cydippe by an apple fool'd at last. Chap. III. The Argument. Love woundeth Petrarchs wary heart, Who well describes that dying smart. My heart was fill'd with wonder and amaze, As one struck dumb, in silence stands at gaze Expecting Counsel, when my friend drew neare, And said: What doe you looke? why stay you here? What mean you? know you not that I am one Of these? and must attend? pray, let's be gone Deare friend (said I) consider what desire To learn the rest hath set my heart on fire; My owne haste stops me. I beleeve't (said he) And I will help; 'tis not forbidden me. This Noble man, on whom the others wait, (You see) is Pompey, justly call'd, The great: Cornelia followeth, weeping his hard fate, And Ptolomies unworthy causelesse hate. You see farre off the Grecian General; His base wife, with Ægisthus wrought his fal: Behold them there, and judge if Love be blinde. But here are Lovers of another kinde, And other faith they kept Lyncus was sav'd By Hypermnestra: Pyramus bereav'd Himselfe of life, thinking his mistresse slain: Thisbes like end, shortned her mourning pain. Leander swimming often, drown'd at last; Hero her faire selfe from her window cast. Courteous Ulisses his long stay doth mourn; His chaste wife prayeth for his safe return, While Circes amarous charmes her prayers controule, And rather vexe then please his vertuous soule. Amilcars sonne, who made great Rome afraid, By a mean wench of Spain is captive led. This Hipsicrates is, the vertuous faire, Who for her husbands deare Love cut her haire And serv'd in all his warres: This is the wife Of Brutus; Portia, constant in her life And death: This Julia is, who seems to mone, That Pompey loved best, when she was gone. Looke here and see the Patriarch much abus'd Who twice seven years for his fair Rachel choos'd To serve: O! powerfull love increast by wot! His father this: Now see his Grandsire goe With Sarah from his home. This cruel Love O'recame good David; so it had power to move His righteous heart to that abhorrid crime, For which he sorrowed all his following time. Just such like errour soil'd his wise sonnes fame, For whose idolatry Gods anger came; Here's he who in one houre could love and hate: Here Tamar full of anguish wailes her state; Her brother Absolon attempts t'appease Her grieved soul. Sampson takes care to please His fancy; and appeares more strong then wise, Who in a traitresse bosome sleeping lies. Amongst those pikes and speares which guard the place, Love, wine, and sleep, a beauteous widdowes face And pleasing Art hath Holopherues taine; She backe again retires, who hath him slain, With her one maide, bearing the horrid head In haste, and thanks God that so wel she sped. The next is Sichem, he who found his death, In circumcision, his father hath Like mischiefe felt; the City all did prove The same effect of his rash violent Love. You see Ahashuerus how well he bears His losse; a new love soon expels his cares: This cure in this disease doth seldome fail, One naile best driveth out another nail. If you would see Love mixed oft with hate, Bitter with sweet; behold fierce Herods state, Beset with Love and crueltie at once: Enraged first, then late his fault bemoans, And Mariamne cals; those three faire Dames (Who in the list of Captives write their names) Pocris, Deidamia, Artimesia were All good, the other three as wicked are; Semiramis, Biblis, and Myrrha nam'd, Who of their crooked wayes are now asham'd: Here be the erring Knights in ancient scroules, Lancelot, Tristram, and the vulgar soules That wait on these; Jiniver, and the faire Isond, with other Lovers: and the pair Who, as they walke together, seeme to plain Their just, but cruel fate, by one hand slaine; Thus he discours'd: and as a man that feares Approching harme, when he a trumpet heares, Starts at the blow ere touch't, my frighted blood Retir'd; as one rais'd from his Tombe I stood: When by my side I spi'd a lovely maide, (No Turtle ever purer whitenesse had) And straight was caught (who lately swore I would Defend me from a man at Armes) nor could Resist the blowes of words with motion grac't; The image yet is in my phansie plac't. My friend was willing to increase my woe, And smiling whisperd; You alone may goe Conferre with whom you please, for now we are All stained with one crime: My sullen care Was like to theirs, who are more griev'd to know Anothers happinesse then their owne woe: For seeing her, who had enthral'd my minde, Live free in peace, and no disturbance finde: And seeing that I knew my hurt too late, And that her beauty was my dying fate: Love, jealousie, and envie held my sight So fixt on that faire face, no other light I could behold; like one who in the rage Of sicknesse greedily his thirst would swage With hurtfull drinke, which doth his palat please, Thus (blinde and deaf t'all other joyes are ease) So many doubtful wayes I followed her The memory still shakes my soul with feare. Since when mine eyes are moist, and view the ground; My heart is heavie, and my steps have found A solitary dwelling 'mongst the woods, I stray ore rocks, and fountains, hils and floods: Since when such store my scattered papers hold Of thoughts, of tears, of inke; which oft I fold, Unfold, and teare: Since when I know the scope Of Love, and what they feare, and what they hope; And how they live that in his Cloyster dwell, The skilfull in their face may reade it well. Mean while I see, how fierce and gallant she Cares not for me, nor for my misery, Proud of her vertue, and my overthrow: And on the other side (if ought I know) This Lord, who hath the world in triumph led, She keeps in feare; thus all my hopes are dead, No strength nor courage left, nor can I be Reveng'd, as I expected once; for he, Who tortures me and others, is abused By her; she'le not be caught, and long hath used (Rebellious as she is!) to shun his vvarres, And is a Sunne amidst the lesser starres. Her grace, smiles, slights, her words in order set; Her haire disperst, or in a golden net; Her eyes enflaming with a light divine So burn my heart, I dare no more rapine. Ah, who is able fully to expresse Her pleasing wayes, her merit? no excesse, No bold Hyperboles I need to feare, My humble stile cannot enough come neare The truth; my words are like a little stream Compar'd with th'Ocean, so large a theame Is that high prayse; new worth, not seen before, Is seen in her, and can be seen no more Therefore all tongues are silenced; and I, Her prisoner now, see her at liberty: And night and day implore (O unjust fate!) She neither heares, nor pitties my estate: Hard lawes of Love! But though a partiall lot I plainly see in this, yet must I not Refuse to serve: the gods, as well as men, With like reward of old have felt like pain. Now knovv I hovv the minde it selfe doth part, (Novv making peace, novv vvarre, novv truce) vvhat art Poore Lovers use to hide their stinging vvoe: And hovv their bloud novv comes, and novv doth goe Betwixt their heart and cheeks, by shame or feare: How they be eloquent, yet speechlesse are: And how they both wayes leane, they watch and sleep, Languish to death, yet life and vigor keep: I trode the pathes made happy by her feet, And search the foe; I am afraid to meet. I know how Lovers metamorphos'd are To that they love: I know what tedious care I feele; how vain my joy, how oft I change Designe, and countenance; and (which is strange) I live without a soul: I know the way To cheat my selfe a thousand times a day: I know to follow whiles I flee my fire: I freeze when present; absent, my desire Is hot: I know what cruel rigour Love Practiseth on the minde, and doth remove All reason thence; and how he racks the heart; And how a soul, hath neither strength nor Art Without a helper to resist his blowes; And how he flees, and how his darts he throwes: And how his threats the feareful Lover feels; And hovv he robs by force, and hovv he steales: Hovv oft his vvheels turne round (novv high, novv lovv) With hovv uncertain hope, hovv certain vvo: Hovv all his promises be voyd of faith, And hovv a fire hid in our bones he hath; Hovv in our vains he makes a secret vvound, Whence open flames and death doe soone abound. In summe, I knovv hovv giddy and hovv vain Be Lovers lives; vvhat feare and boldnesse raigne In all their vvayes; hovv every svveet is paide, And vvith a double vveight of sovvre allaide: I also knovv their customes, sighs, and songs; Their sudden mutenesse, and their stammering tongues, Hovv short their joy, hovv long their pain doth last, Hovv Wormvvood spoyleth all their hunni's taste. The end of the third Chapter. Chap. IV. The Argument. Himselfe with other slaves of Love Are all shut up in Venus grove. When once my will was captive by my fate, And I had lost the liberty, which late Made my life happy; I, who us'd before To flee from Love (as fearefull Deere abhorre The following huntsman) suddenly became (Like all my fellow-servants) calme and tame; And viewd the travels, wrestlings, and the smart, The crooked by-pathes, and the cosening Art That guides the amarous flock: then whil'st mine eye I cast on every corner, to espie Some Ancient or Modern who had prov'd Famous: I saw him, who had onely lov'd Euridice, and found out Hel, to call Her deare Ghost back; he nam'd her in his fall For whom he died. Alceus there was knowne Skilfull in Love and verse: Anacreon Whose Muse sung nought but Love: Pindarus, he Was also there: there I might Virgil see: Many brave wits I found, some looser rimes, By others Writ hath pleas'd the ancient times: Ovid was one: After Catullus came; Propertius next, his Elegies the name Of Cynthia beare: Tibullus, and the young Greeke Poetesse, who is receiv'd among The noble Troup for her rare Saphick Muse. Thus looking here and there (as oft I use) I spi'd much people on a flowry plaine, Amongst themselves disputes of Love maintaine. Behold Beatrix with Dant; Selvagia, she Brought her Pistoyon Cin; Guiton may be Offended that he is the later nam'd: Behold both Guidoes for their learning fam'd: Th'honest Bullonian: The Scicilians first Wrote Love in rimes, but wrote their rimes the worst. Francischin and Senuchio, (who all know) Were worthy and humane: after did go A squadron of another garbe and phrase, Of whom Arnaldo Daniel hath most praise, Great master in Loves Art, his stile as new As sweet, honours his Countrey: next, a few Whom Love did lightly wound; both Peters made Two; one, the lesse Arnaldo: some have had A harder warre; both the Rimbaldoes, th'one Sung Beatrix, though her quality was known Too much above his reach in Mont-ferrat. Alvernia's, old Piero, and Girault: Flocchetto, who from Genua was estrang'd And call'd Marsilian, he wisely chang'd His name, his state, and countrey, and did gain In all: Jeffray made haste to catch his bane With sails and oares: Guilliam too sweetly sung That pleasing Art, was cause he di'd so young. Amareg, Bernard, Hugo, and Anselme Were there, with thousands more, whose tongues were helme, Shield, sword and speare, all their offensive armes, And their defensive to prevent their harmes. From those I turn'd, comparing my owne woe, To view my countrey-folks; and there might know The good Thomasso, who did once adorne Boloigna, now Messina holds his urne. Ah vanisht joyes! Ah life too full of bane! How wert thou from mine eyes so quickly tane? Since without thee nothing is in my power To doe; Where art thou from me at this houre? What is our life? If ought it bring of ease, A sick mans dreame, a fable, told to please. Some few there from the common road did stray; Lelius and Socrates, with whom I may A longer progresse take: O! what a paire Of deare esteemed friends to me they were! 'Tis not my verse, nor prose, may reach their praise; Neither of these can naked Vertue raise Above her owne true place: with them I have Reach't many heights; one yoke of learning gave Lawes to our steps, to them my festered wound I oft have shew'd; no time or place I found To part from them; and hope, and wish we may Be undivided till my breath decay: With them I us'd (too early) to adorne My head with th'honoured branches, onely worne For her deare sake I did so deeply love, Who fill'd my thoughts (but ah!) I dayly prove, No fruit nor leaves from thence can gathered be; The root hath sharp and bitter been to me. For this I was accustom'd much to vexe, But I have seen that which my anger checks: (A Theame for buskins, not a Comick stage) She tooke the God, adored by the rage Of such dul fooles, as he hath captive led: But first, Ile tel you what of us he made; Then from her hand what was his owne sad fate; Which Orpheus or Homer might relate. His winged coursers ore the ditches leapt, And we their way as desperately kept, Till he had reached where his mother raignes, Nor would he ever pul or turne the reignes; But scour'd ore woods and mountains, none did care Nor could discerne in what strange world they were. Beyond the place, where old Ægeus mournes, An Iland lies, Phœbus none sweeter burnes, Nor Neptune ever bath'd a better shore: About the midst a beauteous hill, with store Of shades and pleasing smels, so fresh a spring As drownes all manly thoughts: this place doth bring Venus much joy; 'twas given her Deity, Ere blinde man knew a truer god then she: Of which original it yet retaines Too much, so little goodnesse there remains, That it the vicious doth onely please, Is by the vertuous shun'd as a disease. Here this fine Lord insulteth o're us all Tied in a chaine, from Thule to Ganges fall. Griefes in our breasts, vanity in our armes; Fleeting delights are there, and weighty harmes: Repentance swiftly following to annoy: (Such Tarquine found it, and the bane of Troy) All that whole valley with the Ecchoes rung Of running brookes, and birds that gently sung: The banks were cloath'd in yellow, purple, green, Scarlet and white, their pleasing springs were seen; And gliding streames amongst the tender grasse, Thickets and soft winds to refresh the place. After when Winter maketh sharp the Aire, Warme leaves, and leasure, sports, and gallant cheare Enthrall low minds. Now th'equinox hath made The day t'equal the night; and Progne had With her sweet sister, each their old taske taine: (Ah! how the faith in Fortune plac't is vain!) Just in the time, and place, and in the houre When humble tears should earthly joyes devoure, It pleased him, whom th'vulgar honour so, To triumph over me; and now I knovv What miserable servitude they prove, What ruine, and what death, that fall in Love. Errours, dreams, palenesse waiteth on his chair, False fancies o're the doore, and on the stair Are slipry hopes, unprofitable gain, And gainfull losse; such steps it doth contain, As who descend, may boast their fortune best: Who most ascend, most fall: a wearied rest, And resting trouble, glorious disgrace; A duskish and obscure illustriousnesse; Unfaithful loyalty, and cozening faith, That nimble fury, lazy reason hath: A prison, whose wide wayes doe all receive, Whose narrow paths a hard retiring leave: A steep descent, by which we slide with ease, But finde no hold our crawling steps to raise: Within confusion, turbulence, annoy Are mixt; undoubted woe, and doubtful joy: Vulcano, where the sooty Cyclops dwel; Lyparis, Strombolli, nor Mongibel, Nor Ischia have more horrid noise and smoke: He hates himselfe that stoops to such a yoke. Thus were we all throng'd in so strait a cage, I chang'd my looks and hair, before my age, Dreaming on liberty (by strong desire My soul made apt to hope) and did admire Those gallant mindes, enslav'd to such a woe, (My heart within my brest dissolv'd like snow Before the Sunne) as one would side-wayes cast His eye on pictures, which his feet hath past. The end of the fourth Chapter. The End of the Triumph of Love. THE TRIUMPH OF Chastitie. Chap. I. The Argument. Chastitie binds the winged god, And makes him subject to her rod. When to one yoke at once I saw the height Of Gods and men subdu'd by Cupids might; I tooke example from their cruel fate, And by their sufferings eas'd my owne hard state: Since Phœbus and Leander felt like paine, The one a God, the other but humane. One snare catcht Juno, and the Carthage Dame, (Her Husbands death prepar'd her funerall flame, 'Twas not a cause that Virgil maketh one) I need not grieve, that unprepar'd, alone, Unarm'd, and young, I did receive a wound, Or that my enemy no hurt hath found By Love; or that she cloath'd him in my sight, And tooke his wings, and marr'd his winding flight: No angry Lions send more hideous noyse From their beat breasts, nor clashing thunders voyce Rends Heav'n, frights Earth, and roareth through the aire With greater force, then Love had rais'd, to dare Encounter her, of whom I write; and she As quicke and ready to assaile, as he: Enceladus when Ætna most he shakes, Nor angry Scylla, nor Charibdis makes So great and frightfull noyse, as did the shock Of this (first doubtfull) battel, none could mock Such earnest warre; all drew them to the height To see what maz'd their hearts, and dimn'd their sight. Victorious Love a threatning dart did show His right hand held; the other bore a bow, The string of which he drew just by his eare; No Leopard could chase a frighted Deere (Free, or broke loose) with quicker speed, then he Made haste to wound; fire sparkled from his eye: I burn'd, and had a combat in my brest, Glad t'have her company, yet 'twas not best (Me thought) to see her lost, but 'tis in vain T'abandon goodnesse, and of fate complaine: Vertue her servants never will forsake, As now 'twas seen, she could resistance make: No Fencer ever better warded blow, Nor Pilot did to shore more wisely row To shun a shelfe, then with undaunted power She wav'd the stroke of this sharp Conquerour. Mine eyes and heart were watchfull to attend, In hope the victory would that way bend It ever did; and that I might no more Be barr'd from her; as one, whose thoughts, before His tongue hath utter'd them, you well may see Writ in his looks; O! if you victour be Great Sir, (said I) let her and me be bound Both with one yoke; I may be worthy found, And will not set her free, doubt not my faith: When I beheld her with disdain and wrath So fill'd, that to relate it, would demand A better Muse then mine: Her vertuous hand Had quickly quench't those guilded fiery darts, Which dipt in beauties pleasure, poyson hearts. Neither Camilla, nor the warre-like hoast, That cut their brests, could so much valour boast; Nor Cæsar in Pharsalia fought so well, As she 'gainst him, who pierceth coats of mail; All her brave vertues arm'd, attended there, (A glorious troup!) and marched paire by paire: Honour and blushes first in ranke; the two Religious vertues make the second row; (By those she other women doth excell) Prudence, and Modesty, the twins that dwell Together, both were lodged in her brest; Glory and Perseverance ever blest: Fair Entertainment, Providence without, Sweet courtesie and purenesse round about; Respect of credit, feare of infamy; Grave thoughts in youth, and what not oft agree, True Chastitie, and rarest beauty; these All came 'gainst Love, and this the heav'ns did please And every generous soule in that full height, He had no power left to beare the weight! A thousand famous prizes hardly gain'd She tooke; and thousand glorious palms obtain'd, Shooke from his hands; the fall was not more strange Of Hannibal, when Fortune pleas'd to change Her minde, and on the Romane youth bestow The favours he enjoy'd; nor was he so Amaz'd, who frighted th'Isralitish hoast Struck by the Hebrew boy, that quit his boast: Nor Cirus more astonisht at the fall The Jewish widow gave his Generall: As one that sickens suddenly, and feares His life, or as a man tane unawares In some base act, and doth the finder hate; Just so was he, or in a worse estate: Feare, griefe and shame, and anger in his face Were seen, no troubled Seas more rage, the place Where huge Typheus grones; nor Etna when Her Giant sighs, were mov'd as he was then. I passe by many noble things I see; (To write them, were too hard a taske for me) To her and those that did attend, I go; Her armour was a robe more white then snow; And in her hand a shield like his she bare Who slew Medusa, a faire pillar there Of Jasp was fixt, and with a chain (first wet In Lethe floud) of Jewels fitly set, Diamonds mixt with Topasses (of old 'Twas worne by Ladies, now 'tis not) first hold She catch't, then bound him fast, then such revenge She tooke, as might suffice: my thoughts did change; And I who wisht him victory before, Was satisfi'd, he now could hurt no more. I cannot in my rimes the names contain Of blessed Maids that did make up her train; Calliope nor Clio could suffice, Nor all the other seven for th'enterprise: Yet some I will insert may justly claime Precedency of others. Lucrece came On her right hand: Penelope was by, Those broke his bow, and made his arrowesly Split on the ground, and pull'd his plumes away From off his wings: after Virginia Nere her vext father, arm'd with wrath and hate, Fury, and ir'n and Love, he freed the state And her from slavery, with a manly blow: Next were those barbarous women, who could show They judg'd it better die, then suffer wrong To their rude Chastitie: the wise and strong The chaste Hebræan Judith, followeth these; The Greeke that sav'd her honour in the Seas. With these and other famous soules I see Her Triumph over him, who us'd to be Master of all the world: Amongst the rest The vestall Nunne I spide, who was so blest As by a wonder to preserve her fame. Next came Hersilia the Romane Dame (Or Sabine rather) with her valarous train, Who prove all slanders on that sexe are vain. Then 'mongst the forraign Ladies, she whose faith T'her husband (not Æneas) caus'd her death; The vulgar ignorant may hold their peace, Her safety to her Chastitie gave place; Dido I mean, whom no vain passion led, (As fame belies her) last, the vertuous Maide Retir'd to Aruns, who no rest could finde, Her friends constraining power forc't her minde; The Triumph thither went, where salt waves wet The Bayan shore, eastward; her foot she set There on firme land, and did Avernus leave On the one hand, on th'other Sybils Cave, So to Linternum marcht, the Village where The noble Africane lies buried; there The great newes of her Triumph did appeare As glorious to the eye, as to the eare, The fame had been; and the most chaste did show Most beautifull; it griev'd Love much to go Anothers prisoner, expos'd to scorne, Who to command whole Empires seemed borne. Thus to the chiefest City all were led, Entring the Temple which Sulpitia made Sacred; it drives all madnesse from the minde; And chastities pure Temple next we finde, Which in brave soules doth modest thoughts beget, Not by Plebeians entred, but the great Patrician Dames; there were the spoyles displaid Of the faire victresse; there her palmes she laid, And did commit them to the Thuscan youth, Whose marring scarres beare witnesse of his truth: With others more, whose names I fully knew, (My guide instructed me) that overthrew The power of Love: 'mongst whom of all the rest, Hyppolito and Joseph were the best. The end of this Chapter. THE TRIUMPH OF Death. Chap. I. The Argument. Lauretta meeting cruell Death, Mildely resignes her noble Breath. The glorious Maid, whose soule to Heaven is gone And left the rest cold earth, she who was growne A pillar of true vallour, and had gain'd Much honour by her victory, and chain'd That God which doth the world with terrour binde, Using no armour but her owne chaste minde; A faire aspect, coy thoughts, and words well weigh'd, Sweet modestie to these gave friendly aid. It was a miracle on earth to see The bow and arrowes of the Deitie, And all his armour broke, who erst had slain Such numbers, and so many captive tain: The faire Dame from the noble fight withdrew With her choise company, they were but few, And made a little troup, true vertu's rare, Yet each of them did by her selfe appeare A theame for Poems, and might well incite The best Historian: they bore a white Unspotted Ermine, in a field of green, About whose neck a Topas chain was seen Set in pure gold; their heavenly words and gate Exprest them blest were borne for such a fate. Bright stars they seem'd, she did a Sun appeare, Who darkned not the rest, but made more cleare Their splendour; honour in brave minds is found: This troup with Violets and Roses crown'd, Chearfully marcht, when lo, I might espie Another ensigne dreadfull to mine eye, A Ladie cloth'd in blacke, whose sterne looks were With horrour fill'd, and did like hell appeare, Advanc't, and said, You who are proud to be So fair and young, yet have no eyes to see Hovv neare you are your end, behold, I am She, vvhom they, fierce, and blinde, and cruell name, Who meet untimely deaths; 'tvvas I did make Greece subject, and the Romane Empire shake: My piercing svvord sack't Troy, hovv many rude And barbarous people are by me subdu'd? Many ambitious, vaine, and amarous thought My unvvisht presence hath to nothing brought: Novv am I come to you, vvhiles yet your state Is happy, ere you feel a harder fate. On these you have no povver, she then replide, Who had more vvorth then all the vvorld beside, And little over me; but there is one Who vvill be deeply griev'd vvhen I am gone, His happinesse doth on my life depend, I shall finde freedome in a peacefull end. As one vvho glancing vvith a sudden eye Some unexpected object doth espie; Then lookes again, and doth his ovvne haste blame: So in a doubting pause, this cruell dame A little staid, and said, The rest I call To minde, and knovv I have o'recome them all: Then with lesse fierce aspect, she said, Thou guide Of this faire crew, hast not my strength assaid, Let her advise, who may command, prevent Decrepit age, 'tis but a punishment; From me this honour thou alone shalt have, Without or feare or paine, to finde thy grave, As he shall please, who dwelleth in the Heaven And rules on earth, such portion must be given To me, as others from thy hand receive: She answered then; a farre we might perceave Millions of dead heapt on th'adjacent plain, No verse nor prose may comprehend the slain Did on deaths Triumph wait, from India, From Spain, and from Morocco, from Cathai, And all the skirts of th'earth they gathred were, Who had most happy liv'd, attended there; Popes, Emperours, nor Kings, no ensignes wore Of their past height, but naked shew'd and poore. Where be their riches, where their precious jems, Their Miters, Scepters, Roabs and Diadems? O miserable men, whose hopes arise From worldly joyes, yet be there few so wise As in those trifling follies not to trust; And if they be deceiv'd in end 'tis just: Ah, more then blinde, what gain you by your toyle You must returne once to your mothers soyle, And after times your names shall hardly know, Nor any profit from your labour grow; All those strange countreyes by your warlick stroke Submitted to a tributary yoke; The fuell erst of your ambitious fire, What helpe they now? the vast and bad desire Of wealth and power at a bloody rate Is wicked, better bread and water eat With peace; a woodden dish doth seldome hold A poysoned draught, glasse is more safe then gold; But for this Theame a larger time will aske, I must betake me to my former taske. The fatall houre of her short life drew neare, That doubtfull passage which the world doth feare; Another company, who had not beene Freed from their earthy burden there were seene, To try if prayers could appease the wrath, Or stay th'inexorable hand of death. That beauteous croude conveen'd to see the end Which all must taste; each neighbour, every friend Stood by, when grim death with her hand tooke hold, And pull'd away one onely haire of gold. Thus from the world this fairest flower is tane To make her shine more bright, not out of spleen: How many moaning plaints, what store of cries Were uttered there, when fate shut those faire eyes For which so oft I sung; whose beautie burn'd My tortur'd heart so long; whiles others mourn'd She pleas'd, and quiet did the fruit enjoy Of her blest life; farewell, without annoy, True Saint on earth, said they; so might she be Esteem'd, but nothing bates deaths crueltie. What shall become of others, since so pure A body did such heats and colds endure, And chang'd so often in so little space? Ah worldly hopes, how blinde you be, how base? If since I bathe the ground with flowing teares For that milde soule, who sees it witnesse bears; And thou who read'st maist judge she fetter'd me. The sixt of April, and did set me free On the same day and moneth: O! how the way Of fortune is unsure, none hates the day Of slavery, or of death, so much as I Abhorre the time which wrought my liberty, And my too-lasting life; it had been just My greater age had first been turn'd to dust, And paid to time, and to the world tho' debt I ow'd, then earth had kept her glorious state: Now at what rate I should the sorrow prise I know not, nor have Art that can suffuse The sad affliction, to relate in verse Of these faire Dames, that wept about her herse Courtesie, Vertue, Beautie, all are lost, What shall become of us? none else can boast Such high perfection, no more we shall Heare her wise words, nor the Angelicall Sweet musick of her voyce; whiles thus they cride The parting spirit doth it selfe divide With every vertue from the noble brest, As some grave Hermite, seeks a lonely rest: The Heav'ns were cleare, and all the ambient Aire Without a threatning Cloud, no adversaire Durst once appeare, or her calme minde affright; Death singly did her selfe conclude the fight; After, when feare, and the extreamest plaint Were ceast, th'attentive eyes of all were bent On that faire face, and by despaire became Secure; she who was spent, not like a flame By force extinguisht, but as lights decay, And undiscerned waste themselves away: Thus went the soule in peace, so lamps are spent, As the oyle fails which gave them nourishment; In summe, her countenance you still might know The same it was, not pale, but white as snow, Which on the tops of hills in gentle fleakes Fals in a calme, or as a man that takes Desired rest, as if her lovely sight Were clos'd with sweetest sleep, after the spright Was gone. If this be that fooles call to die, Death seem'd in her exceeding faire to be. The end of the first Chapter. Chap. II. The Argument. The happy spirit doth descend To comfort her afflicted friend. That night which followed the too-sad decay Of my best Sunne, whiles it was yet full day: (Whence I remain as blinde) the Summer dew Slides through the Aire, and faire Titonia now Bestowes true dreames, (when like the growing yeare) A Ladie (crown'd with orient jemmes) drew nere: (With whom a thousand other Crownes did move) And stretching forth that object of my love, Her hand; she spoke, from whose sweet words did flow Joy to my soule, and said, Doe you not know Her, who hath rais'd your thoughts above the strain Of the low vulgar, as her love did gain Place in your heart, then vvith a sober looke She set her selfe and me, close by a brooke O're shadowed vvith a lavvrell and a beach: Like one vvhose vveeping interrupts his speech: Must I not knovv the soul maintains my breath; But doe you live, or are tane hence by death? I answer'd, Pray instruct; I live said she, And you are dead, till you be joyn'd with me: But time is short, though vve desire it long, Take my advice, and curb your flovving tongue: The day approacheth fast, my sad reply Was this: Ah say, is it much pain to die? You lately tri'd and knevv, you'l ne'r obtain True happinesse, she said, if you remaine In this so blinde and common errour; knovv, Death is the end of prison and darke vvoe To vvell-bred soules, doth onely terrour prove To those that place on earthy drosse their love; And even my death vvhich doth my soul annoy, Could you conceive the least part of my joy, Would make you happy (having fixt her eye, Whiles thus she spake, devoutly on the skie) Then clos'd her rosie lips, and silent staid: Sicknesse and Tyrants crueltie have made Death bitter, I reply'd; 'Tis true, said she, The pains we feel before death bitter be, And hellish torments worse; but he whose minde Is staid by heavenly hopes, shall truely finde, Though weake and wearied, this last step a short Sigh, and no more; as I drew neare the Port, My body weake, my soul did much rejoyce; Yet heard the whispering of mourning voyce; Alas, for him who reckons every day A thousand yeares, and stil in vain doth stay On earth, and never more must see her face On Sea or Land, and filleth every place With that one Theame, and findeth no delight Of ought but her, to thinke, or speake, or write. My sight I that way turn'd, from whence mine eare Receiv'd the sound, and saw 'twas she whose care Us'd to incite my Love, and temper thine: Her face and speech I knew, oft her divine Wise councels, healing cordials were to me, With honest mirth and chearful gravitie: When I with most felicitie was blest In my first prime, and when thou lov'dst me best; When thy praise fam'd me most, even then my life Was little better then a bitter strife, Compar'd with that sweet death, which few obtain; No banisht man call'd to his home again Is more joy'd, then this passage pleased me: But for the pitty that I had of thee I do adjure thee, by that faithfull Love Thou knewst on earth, but better know'st above; Did ever Love, said I, beget in thee One thought to pitty my long misery, Not wronging thy great minde; the sweet disdain, Sweet mildnesse of your looks in doubtfull pain, Hath held my wishes long; ere I had said The words, a lightning smile, such as oft paid And eas'd the sadnesse of my wounded heart I saw: Then she replide; Nothing could part My soule from thine, nor shal; but 't did behove With outward coldnesse to restrain thy love, No other way would have preserv'd our fame; A rod destroyes not a kinde mothers name; I studied to conceale my Love, such care And providence dwell not with hope and feare; My countenance you saw, but not my heart, I turn'd and staid thy course with heedfull Art; As one would tame a horse: my cheeks have been Oft dy'd with fain'd wrath, when my heart within Was a whole fire of Love; yet reason still Kept her owne place, and did command my will: But when I found thee overcharg'd with woe, I us'd my milder lookes, preventing so Thy death, and my reproach; when I observ'd Thy passion grow too strong, I then reserv'd My selfe, as if with griefe or feare opprest: These were my ensignes, and I found it best To mixe disdains with favours, this your songs Have made already passe through many tongues; When I beheld the teares swimme in thine eye, I said, Without my help, I feare he'll dye: Then gave some modest aid; when you were bold, I said, he must be curb'd: now pale and cold, Now warme and fresh, now sad, now full of joy, I kept thee safe, not without much annoy; Glad t'have thus finisht, 'twere enough reward Could I believ't; thus trembling, as affeard, Not with dry eyes, I said, she made reply, Doe you distrust, for what end should I ly; A little blushing, then went on, If to My partiall eye, the world esteemed you: I held me quiet, being throughly blest In that true-love knot lockt within my brest: The faire report (if it be truth) I heare Thy praises have acquir'd me farre and neare, I much esteem, and never more did crave But moderation in thy love to have; That onely wanted; whiles with signes of woe You would perswade what I did throughly know, To open view you did your heart expose: My coldnesse hence, hence your distemper rose: In other things we did like friends agree, Joyn'd by a Love, from all base passions free; My heart was burnt with almost equal fire, At least, when once I knew thy strong desire; But mine I hid, whiles yours was open laid: When you were hoarce, with having often praid, For pittie, I was silent, shame and feare Were cause my great Love did but smal appeare: Griefe is of no lesse weight, because conceal'd, Nor more when by impatience 'tis reveal'd; Deceit doth not increase, nor yet impaire A truth; But say, Was not my Love then cleare When I receiv'd the lines you sent before Your face and song? My Love dares say no more. My heart was stil with thee, though I restrain'd My lookes; and you, as having vvrong, complain'd, Because I gave the most part, and vvithdrevv The least, yet was not that vvith-held from you; A thousand and a thousand times mine eye Was turn'd with pittie on thy misery; And ever had continued stil the same, But that I fear'd a danger in thy flame: And not to leave you in suspence, Ile shovv What I beleeve you vvil be glad to know; In all the rest I found a pleasing fate, Onely for one cause I dislik'd my state; My place of birth did to my thoughts appeare Too meane, and I stil grieve 'tvvas not more neare Thy flovvry seat, yet doe I vvel approve Of any Countrey where I had thy Love; Besides, the heart in vvhich I place most trust, If me thou hadst not known, 'tis like it must Have elsewhere lov'd, so had I got lesse fame; You do mistake, my Love had been the same Where ever you had liv'd, my Starres did raise Me to so high a flame, I said: much praise And honour have attended me, she said, How e're it be, but I too long have staid: Thy joy makes thee forget the wings of time, Aurora now brings day, the Sun doth climbe Above the Ocean, from her golden bed; At last, about to part and leave me sad, She said, If you have ought besides make haste And end your speach before the time be past; All my past suff'rings your kinde words make light, I answered, But I grieve without your sight, And wish to know, if I am like to be Long here, or if I soon may follow thee: She going thus replide; I do beleeve, That without me on earth you long must live. The End of the Triumph of Death. When first my light did shine, you lik'd me well. Now that is gone; you hate my loathsome smell; You with prolongers made me live, and art Preserv'd my light; but now Time acts his part, Triumphant Time, shews now my glasse is run And all must end, that ever was begun: Envy hath playd its part, and I do go To Coffin: as I do, all must do so. Time breaths a shrewd and life-bereaving blast, Yet upward flyes my light, where it shall last. I'me glad to part from body, which I lov'd So deer, that many wayes and arts I prov'd This mudwall to maintain, and body save, But yet in spight of me 'twill go to grave. This is my comfort, Body, that thy tombe Which is thy grave, shall be thy mothers womb To bring thee once again unto the light, And life, which death shall never know, or night: Then be content, though you and I depart: Yet Soul and Body still shall have one heart. And upward flyes my soul, where it shall dwell, Beyond the reach of Envy, Death, or Hell. FINIS.</field>
