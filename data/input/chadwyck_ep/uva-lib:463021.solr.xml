Phillipps MS. 8151 (formerly Prince Henry's, Son of James I). leaf 3: vellum, ab. 1450 A. D. The Compleynte of the Virgin before the Cross. (englisht by command of Lady Hereford.) [The first leaf of the MS. and of this Compleynte (a 1) is lost. The first 2 leavs of the Poem to ‚ÄòOldcastel,‚Äô sign. a 7, 8, hav been put befor the 2nd leaf of the Virgin Compleynte (sign. a 2), to prevent the MS. looking incomplete. Ther was thus at least one rascaly bookseller in James I's time.] 7 O Womman,‚Äî√æat among the peple speek How √æat the wombe blessid was √æat beer, And the tetes √æat yaf to sowken eek The sone of god / which on hy hangith heer,‚Äî What seist thow now / why comest thow no neer? Why nart thow heere? / o womman, where art thow, That nat ne seest my woful wombe now? 8 O Simeon / thow seidest me ful sooth ‚ÄòThe strook that perce shal my sones herte, My soule thirle it shal‚Äô / and so it dooth: The wownde of deeth ne may I nat asterte, Ther may no martirdom me make smerte So sore as this martree smertith me: So sholde he seyn / √æat myn hurt mighte see. 9 O. Ioachim / o deere fadir myn! And seint Anne, my modir deere also! To what entente / or to what ende or fyn Broghten yee me foorth / √æat am greeued so? Mirthe is to me become a verray fo. Your fadir Dauid / √æat an harpour was, Conforted folk √æat stood in heuy cas. 10 Me thynkith yee nat doon to me aright, √ûat were his successours / syn instrument Han yee noon left / wher-with me make light, And me conforte, in my woful torment. Me to doon ese / han yee no talent, And knowen myn conforteless distresse: Yee oghten weepe for myn heuynesse. 11 O blessid sone / on thee wole I out throwe My salte teeres / for oonly on thee My look is set / o thynke / how many a throwe Thow in myn armes lay / and on my knee Thow sat / &amp; haddist many a kus of me. Eeek thee, to sowke, on my breestes yaf y, Thee norisshyng faire &amp; tendrely. 12 Now thee fro me, withdrawith bittir deeth, And makith a wrongful disseuerance. Thynke nat, sone / in me √æat any breeth Endure may / √æat feele al this greuance; My martirdom me hath at the outrance; I needes sterue moot / syn I thee see Shamely nakid, strecchid on a tree. 13 And this me sleeth / √æat in the open day Thyn hertes wownde shewith him so wyde √ûat alle folk see and beholde it may, So largeliche opned is thy syde. O! wo is me, syn I nat may it hyde! And, among othre of my smerte greeues, Thow put art also, sone, amonges theeues, 14 As thow were an euel &amp; wikkid wight. And, lest √æat somme folk par auenture No knowleche hadde of thy persone aright, Thy name, Pilat hath put in scripture, √ûat knowe mighte it euery creature, For thy penance sholde nat been hid. O / wo is me / √æat al this see betid! 15 How may myn yen, √æat beholde al this, Restreyne hem for to shewe by weepynge Myn hertes greef / moot I nat weepe? O yis! Sone, if thow haddist a fadir lyuynge, That wolde weepe &amp; make waymentynge, For √æat he hadde paart of thy persone, That were a greet abreggynge of my mone. 16 But thow in eerthe / fadir haddist neuere; No wight for thee / swich cause hath for to pleyne, As √æat haue I / shalt thow fro me disseuere, √ûat aart al heolly myn? my sorwes deepe Han al myn hertes ioie leid to sleepe. No wight with me, in thee, my sone, hath part: Hoolly of my blood / deere chyld / thow art. 17 That doublith al my torment &amp; my greef. Vn-to myn herte / it is confusion, Thyn harm to see / √æat art to me so leef. Mighte nat, sone / the Redempcioun Of man han bee withoute effusioun Of thy blood? yis / if it had been thy lust. But what thow wilt be doon / souffre me must! 18 O deeth / so thow kythist thy bittirnesse First on my sone / &amp; aftirward on me. Bittir art thow / &amp; ful of crabbidnesse, That my sone hast slayn thurgh thy crueltee, And nat me sleest / certein, nat wole I flee. Come of / come of / &amp; slee me heere, as blyue! Departe from him / wole I nat a lyue! 19 O moone / o sterres / and thow firmament! How may yee, fro wepynge yow restreyne, And seen your Creatour in swich torment? Yee oghten troublid been in euery veyne, And his despitous deeth / with me compleyne. Weepeth &amp; crieth as lowde as yee may, Our Creatour with wrong is slayn this day. 20 O sonne, with thy cleere bemes brighte, √ûat seest my child nakid this nones tyde, Why souffrest thow him, in the open sighte Of the folk heere / vnkeuered abyde? Thou art as moche, or more, holde him to hyde, Than Sem, √æat helid his Fadir Noe Whan he espyde √æat nakid was he. 21 If thow his sone be / do lyk ther-to! Come of / withdrawe thy bemes brightnesse! Thow art to blame / but if thow so do. For shame / hyde my sones nakidnesse! Is ther in thee no sparcle of kyndenesse? Remembre he is thy lord and Creatour! Now keuere him / for thy worsship &amp; honour! 22 O eerthe / what lust hast thow to susteene The crois on which he √æat thee made, and it, Is hangid? / and aourned thee with greene Which √æat thow werist / how hast thow thee qwit Vn-to thy lord? / o do this for him yit! O! wake for doel / &amp; cleue thow in two, And al √æat blood / restore me vn-to, 23 Which thow hast dronke / it myn is, &amp; not thyn; Or elles thus / withouten taryynge Tho bodyes dede / whiche in thee √æat lyn, Caste out / for they, by taast of swich dewynge, Hem oghte clothe ageyn in hir clothynge. Thow Caluarie / thow art namely Holden for to do so / to thee speke Y. 24 O deere sone / myn deeth neighith faste, Syn to an othir / thow hast youen me Than vn-to thee / &amp; how may my lyf laste, √ûat me yeuest any othir than thee? Thogh he / whom thow me yeuest / maiden be, And thogh by iust balance / thow weye al, The weighte of him &amp; thee / nat is egal. 25 He a disciple is / &amp; thow art a Lord; Thow al away art gretter than he is; Betwixt your mightes / is ther greet discord. My woful torment / doublid is by this; I needes mourne moot / &amp; fare amis; It seemeth √æat thow makist departynge Twixt thee &amp; me for ay / withoute endynge; 26 And namely / syn thow me ‚Äòwomman‚Äô callist, As I to thee straunge were and vnknowe; Therthurgh, my sone / thow my ioie appallist; Wel feele I √æat deeth his vengeable bowe Hath bent / &amp; me purposith doun to throwe. Of sorwe talke may I nat ynow, Syn fro my name / I-doon away is now. 27 Wel may men clepe and calle me ‚ÄòMara‚Äô! From hennes forward, so may men me call. How sholde I lenger clept be ‚ÄòMar√Øa‚Äô, Syn ‚ÄòI‚Äô, which is Ihesus, is fro me fall This day / al my swetnesse is in-to gall Torned, syn √æat ‚ÄòI‚Äô, which was the beautee Of my name / this day bynome is me. 28 O Iohn, my deere freend! thow haast receyued A woful modir / and an heuy sone Haue I of thee / deeth hath myn othir weyued! How may we two, the deeth eschue or shone? We drery wightes two / wher may we wone? Thou art of confort / destitut / I see; And so am I / ful careful been wee! 29 Vn-to oure hertes / deeth hath sent his wownde: Noon of vs may alleggen othres peyne. So manye sorwes in vs two habownde, We han no might, fro sorwe vs restreyne; I see non othir / die moot we tweyne; Now let vs steruen heer par compaignie! Sterue thow there / &amp; heere wole I die. 30 O Angels / thogh yee mourne and waile &amp; weepe, Yee do no wrong / slayn is your Creatour By the folk √æat yee weren wont to keepe And gye &amp; lede / they to dethes shour Han put him / thogh yee han wo &amp; langour, No wondir is it / who may blame yow? And yit ful cheer he had hem √æat him slow. 31 O / special loue / √æat me ioyned haast Vn-to my sone / strong is thy knyttynge! This day ther-in fynde I a bittir taast; For now the taast I feele, &amp; the streynynge Of deeth / by thy deeth / feele I deeth me stynge. O poore modir / what shalt thow now seye? Poore Marie / thy wit is aweye! 32 Marie? nay / but ‚Äòmarred‚Äô I thee call. So may I wel / for thow art / wel I woot, Vessel of care &amp; wo, &amp; sorwes all! Now thow art frosty cold / now fyry hoot; And right as √æat a ship, or barge, or boot, Among the wawes dryueth steerelees, So doost thow, woful womman, confortlees! 33 And of modir / haast thow eek lost the style: No more maist thow clept be by thy name! O sones of Adam / al to long whyle Yee tarien hens / hieth hidir for shame! See how my sone / for your gilt &amp; blame, Hangith heer al bybled vp on the crois! Bymeneth him in herte &amp; cheere &amp; vois! 34 His blody stremes, see now &amp; beholde! If yee to him han any affeccioun, Now for his wo / your hertes oghten colde.

O now thyn help / thy socour and releef! And I for ay / mis reule wole exyle. 8 But thy mercy excede myn offense / The keene assautes of thyn aduersarie Me wole oppresse with hir violence. No wondir / thogh thow be to me contrarie; My lustes blynde han causid thee to varie Fro me / thurgh my folie &amp; inpudence; Wherfore / I, wrecche / curse may &amp; warie The seed and fruyt of chyldly sapience. 9 As for the more paart / youthe is rebel Vn-to reson / &amp; hatith her doctryne, Regnynge which / it may nat stande wel With yowthe / as fer as wit can ymagyne. O / yowthe / allas / why wilt thow nat enclyne, And vn-to reuled reform bowe thee? Syn resoun is the verray streighte lyne √ûat ledith folk / vn-to felicitee. 10 Ful seelde is seen / √æat yowthe takith heede Of perils √æat been likly for to fall; For, haue he take a purpos / √æat moot nede Been execut / no conseil wole he call; His owne wit, he demeth best of all; And foorth ther-with / he renneth brydillees, As he √æat nat betwixt hony and gall Can iuge / ne the werre fro the pees. 11 All othir mennes wittes he despisith; They answeren no thyng to his entente; His rakil wit only to him souffysith; His hy presumpcioun nat list consente To doon as √æat Salomon wroot &amp; mente, √ûat redde men by conseil for to werke: Now, youthe, now / thow sore shalt repente Thy lightlees wittes dull, of reson derke! 12 My freendes seiden vn-to me ful ofte, My mis reule me cause wolde a fit; And redden me, in esy wyse &amp; softe, A lyte and lyte to withdrawen it; But √æat nat mighte synke in-to my wit, So was the lust y-rootid in myn herte. And now I am so rype vn-to my pit, √ûat scarsely I may it nat asterte. 13 Who-so cleer yen hath, &amp; can nat see, Ful smal, of ye, auaillith the office / Right so / syn reson youen is to me For to discerne a vertu from a vice, If I nat can with resoun me cheuice, But wilfully fro reson me withdrawe, Thogh I of hir haue no benefice, No wondir / ne no fauour in hir lawe. 14 Reson me bad / &amp; redde as for the beste, To ete and drynke in tyme attemprely; But wilful youthe nat obeie leste Vn-to √æat reed / ne sette nat ther-by. I take haue of hem bothe outrageously And out of tyme / nat two yeer or three, But .xx.?? wyntir past continuelly, Excesse at borde hath leyd his knyf with me. 15 The custume of my repleet abstinence, My greedy mowth, Receite of swich outrage, And hondes two / as woot my negligence, Thus han me gyded / &amp; broght in seruage Of hire √æat werreieth euery age, Seeknesse, y meene, riotoures whippe, Habundantly √æat paieth me my wage, So √æat me neithir daunce list, ne skippe. 16 The outward signe of Bachus &amp; his lure, √ûat at his dore hangith day by day / Excitith folk / to taaste of his moisture So often / √æat man can nat wel seyn nay. For me, I seye / I was enclyned ay With-outen daunger thidir for to hye me, But if swich charge / vp on my bake lay, That I moot it forbere / as for a tyme; 17 Or but I were nakidly bystad By force of the penylees maladie, For thanne in herte kowde I nat be glad, Ne lust had noon to Bachus hows to hie. Fy ? Lak of coyn / departith conpaignie, And heuy purs, with herte liberal, Qwenchith the thirsty hete of hertes drie, Wher chynchy herte / hath ther-of but smal. 18 I dar nat telle / how √æat the fresshe repeir Of venus femel lusty children deere, √ûat so goodly / so shaply were, and feir, And so plesant of port &amp; of maneere, And feede cowden al a world with cheere, And of atyr passyngly wel byseye, At Poules heed me maden ofte appeere, To talke of mirthe / &amp; to disporte &amp; pleye. 19 Ther was sweet wyn ynow thurgh-out the hous, And wafres thikke / for this conpaignie √ûat I spak of / been sumwhat likerous, Where as they mowe a draght of wyn espie, Sweete / and in wirkynge hoot for the maistrie To warme a stomak with / ther-of they dranke. To suffre hem paie, had been no courtesie: That charge I tooke / to wynne loue &amp; thanke. 20 Of loues aart / yit touchid I no deel; I cowde nat / &amp; eek it was no neede: Had I a kus / I was content ful weel, Bettre than I wolde han be with the deede: Ther-on can I but smal; it is no dreede: Whan √æat men speke of it in my presence, For shame I wexe as reed as is the gleede. Now wole I torne ageyn to my sentence. 21 Of him √æat hauntith tauerne of custume, At shorte wordes / the profyt is this: In double wyse / his bagge it shal consume, And make his tonge speke of folk amis; For in the cuppe / seelden fownden is, √ûat any wight his neigheburgh commendith. Beholde &amp; see / what auantage is his, √ûat god / his freend / &amp; eek him self, offendith. 22 But oon auauntage / in this cas I haue: I was so ferd / with any man to fighte, Cloos kepte I me / no man durste I depraue But rownyngly / I spak no thyng on highte. And yit my wil was good / if √æat I mighte, For lettynge of my manly cowardyse, √ûat ay of strookes impressid the wighte, So √æat I durste medlen in no wyse. 23 Wher was a gretter maister eek than y, Or bet aqweyntid at Westmynstre yate, Among the tauerneres namely, And Cookes / whan I cam / eerly or late? I pynchid nat at hem in myn acate, But paied hem / as √æat they axe wolde; Wherfore I was the welcomere algate, And for ‚Äòa verray gentil man‚Äô y-holde. 24 And if it happid on the Someres day √ûat I thus at the tauerne hadde be, Whan I departe sholde / &amp; go my way Hoom to the priuee seel / so wowed me Heete &amp; vnlust and superfluitee To walke vn-to the brigge / &amp; take a boot / √ûat nat durste I contrarie hem all three, But dide as √æat they stired me / god woot. 25 And in the wyntir / for the way was deep, Vn-to the brigge I dressid me also, And ther the bootmen took vp-on me keep, For they my riot kneewen fern ago: With hem was I I-tugged to and fro, So wel was him / √æat I with wolde fare; For riot paieth largely / eueremo; He styntith neuere / til his purs be bare. 26 Othir than ‚Äòmaistir‚Äô / callid was I neuere, Among this meynee, in myn audience. Me thoghte / I was y-maad a man for euere: So tikelid me √æat nyce reuerence, √æat it me made larger of despense Than √æat I thoght han been / o flaterie! The guyse of thy traiterous diligence Is, folk to mescheef haasten / &amp; to hie. 27 Al be it √æat my yeeres be but yonge / Yit haue I seen in folk of hy degree, How √æat the venym of faueles tonge Hath mortified hir prosperitee, And broght hem in so sharp aduersitee √ûat it hir lyf hath also throwe a-doun. And yit ther can no man in this contree Vnnethe eschue this confusioun. 28 Many a seruant / vn-to his lord seith, ‚Äò√ûat al the world spekith of him honour,‚Äô Whan the contrarie of √æat / is sooth in feith: And lightly leeued is this losengeour: His hony wordes / wrappid in errour, Blyndly conceyued been / the more harm is! O! thow, fauele, of lesynges Auctour, Causist al day / thy lord to fare amis! 29 Tho combreworldes clept been ‚Äò√©nchantours‚Äô In bookes / as √æat I haue, or this, red, That is to seye, sotil deceyuours, By whom the peple is mis gyed &amp; led, And with plesance so fostred and fed, √ûat they forgete hem self, &amp; can nat feele The soothe of the condicion in hem bred, No more / than hir wit were in hire heele. 30 Who-so √æat list in ‚Äòthe book of nature Of beestes‚Äô rede / ther-in he may see (If he take heede vn-to the scripture,) Where it spekith of meermaides in the See, How √æat so inly mirie syngith shee, √ûat the shipman ther-with fallith a sleepe, And by hir aftir deuoured is he: From al which song, is good, men hem to keepe. 31 Right so the feyned wordes of plesance Annoyen aftir / thogh they plese a tyme To hem √æat been vnwyse of gouernance, Lordes! beeth waar / Let nat fauel yow lyme! If √æat yee been enuolupid in cryme, Yee may nat deeme / men speke of yow weel, Thogh fauel peynte hir tale in prose or ryme: Ful holsum is it / truste hir nat a deel. 32 Holcote seith vp-on the book also Of sapience / as it can testifie, Whan √æat Vlixes saillid to and fro By meermaides / this was his policie, Alle eres of men of his compaignie, With wex he stoppe leet / for √æat they noght Hir song sholde heere / lest the armonye Hem mighte vn-to swich deedly sleep han broght, 33 And bond him self / vn-to the shippes mast: Lo! thus hem alle, saued his prudence. The wys man is, of peril sore agast. O flaterie! o lurkyng pestilence! If sum man dide his cure &amp; diligence To stoppe his eres fro thy poesie, And nat wolde herkne a word of thy sentence, Vn-to his greef it were a remedie. 34 As nay / al thogh thy tonge were ago, Yit canst thow glose in contenance &amp; cheere; Thow supportist with lookes eueremo Thy lordes wordes in eche mateere, Al-thogh √æat they a myte be to deere; And thus thy gyse is priuee and appert With word and look / among our lordes heere Preferred be / thogh ther be no dissert. 35 But whan the sobre / treewe, &amp; weel auysid, With sad visage his lord enfourmeth pleyn, How √æat his gouernance is despysid Among the peple / &amp; seith him as they seyn, As man treewe oghte vn-to his souereyn, Conseillynge him amende his gouernance, The lordes herte swellith for desdeyn, And bit him voide blyue with meschaunce. 36 Men setten nat by trouthe now adayes; Men loue it nat / men wole it nat cherice; And yit is trouthe best at all assayes. When √æat fals fauel, soustenour of vice, Nat wite shal how hire to cheuyce, Ful boldely shal trouthe hir heed vp bere. Lordes, lest fauel / yow fro wele tryce, No lenger souffre hir nestlen in your ere! 37 Be as be may / no more of this as now; But to my mis reule wole I refeere. Wher as I was at ese weel ynow, Or excesse vn-to me leef was, &amp; deere, And, or I kneew his ernestful maneere, My purs, of coyn had resonable wone; But now, ther-in can ther but scant appeere: Excesse hath ny exyled hem echone. 38 The feend and excesse been conuertible, As enditith to me my fantasie: This is my skile / if it be admittible: Excesse of mete &amp; drynke is glotonye; Glotonye awakith malencolie; Malencolie engendrith werre &amp; stryfe; Stryf causith mortel hurt thurgh hir folie: Thus may excesse reue a soule hir lyfe. 39 No force of al this / go we now to wacche By nightirtale / out of al mesure; For as in √æat / fynde kowde I no macche In al the priuee seel with me to endure; And to the cuppe ay took I heede &amp; cure, For √æat the drynke apalle sholde noght. But whan the pot emptid was of moisture, To wake aftirward / can nat in my thoght. 40 But whan the cuppe had thus my neede sped, And sumdel more than necessitee, With repleet spirit wente I to my bed, And bathid there in superfluitee. But on the morn / was wight of no degree So looth as I / to twynne fro my cowche: By aght I woot / abyde / let me see! Of two / as looth / I am seur, kowde I towche. 41 I dar nat seyn Prentys and Arondel Me countrefete, &amp; in swich wach go ny me; But often they hir bed louen so wel, √ûat of the day / it drawith ny the pryme, Or they ryse vp / nat tell I can the tyme Whan they to bedde goon / it is so late. O helthe, lord / thow seest hem in √æat cryme! And yit thee looth is / with hem to debate. 42 And why / I not / it sit nat vn-to me, √ûat mirour am of riot &amp; excesse, To knowen of a goddes pryuetee; But thus I ymagyne / and thus I gesse: Thow meeued art, of tendre gentillesse, Hem to forbere / and wilt hem nat chastyse, For they, in merthe and vertuous gladnesse, Lordes reconforten in sundry wyse. 43 But to my purpos / syn √æat my seeknesse, As wel of purs as body, hath refreyned Me fro Tauerne / &amp; othir wantonnesse, Among an heep / my name is now desteyned, My greuous hurt ful litil is conpleyned, But they, the lak compleyne of my despense. Allas √æat euere knyt I was, and cheyned To excesse / or him dide obedience. 44 Despenses large enhaunce a mannes loos Whil they endure / &amp; whan they be forbore, His name is deed / men keepe hir mowthes cloos, As nat a peny had he spent tofore. My thank is qweynt / my purs, his stuf hath lore, And my Carkeis repleet with heuynesse.
